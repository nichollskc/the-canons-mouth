    <h3><b> BOOK I </b></h3>
    
    <h5> THE ARGUMENT. </h5>
    
    <p>
      The Trojans, after a seven years&rsquo; voyage, set sail for Italy, but are
      overtaken by a dreadful storm, which Aeolus raises at the request of Juno. The
      tempest sinks one, and scatters the rest. Neptune drives off the winds, and calms
      the sea. Aeneas, with his own ship and six more, arrives safe at an African port.
      Venus complains to Jupiter of her son&rsquo;s misfortunes. Jupiter comforts her,
      and sends Mercury to procure him a kind reception among the Carthaginians.
      Aeneas, going out to discover the country, meets his mother in the shape of a
      huntress, who conveys him in a cloud to Carthage, where he sees his friends
      whom he thought lost, and receives a kind entertainment from the queen. Dido,
      by device of Venus, begins to have a passion for him, and, after some discourse
      with him, desires the history of his adventures since the siege of Troy,
      which is the subject of the two following books.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>rms, and the man I sing, who, forc&rsquo;d by fate,<br />
      And haughty Juno&rsquo;s unrelenting hate,<br />
      Expell&rsquo;d and exil&rsquo;d, left the Trojan shore.<br />
      Long labours, both by sea and land, he bore,<br />
      And in the doubtful war, before he won<br />
      The Latian realm, and built the destin&rsquo;d town;<br />
      His banish&rsquo;d gods restor&rsquo;d to rites divine,<br />
      And settled sure succession in his line,<br />
      From whence the race of Alban fathers come,<br />
      And the long glories of majestic Rome.<br />
      O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate;<br />
      What goddess was provok&rsquo;d, and whence her hate;<br />
      For what offence the Queen of Heav&rsquo;n began<br />
      To persecute so brave, so just a man;<br />
      Involv&rsquo;d his anxious life in endless cares,<br />
      Expos&rsquo;d to wants, and hurried into wars!<br />
      Can heav&rsquo;nly minds such high resentment show,<br />
      Or exercise their spite in human woe?<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Against the Tiber&rsquo;s mouth, but far away,<br />
      An ancient town was seated on the sea;<br />
      A Tyrian colony; the people made<br />
      Stout for the war, and studious of their trade:<br />
      Carthage the name; belov&rsquo;d by Juno more<br />
      Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore.<br />
      Here stood her chariot; here, if Heav&rsquo;n were kind,<br />
      The seat of awful empire she design&rsquo;d.<br />
      Yet she had heard an ancient rumour fly,<br />
      (Long cited by the people of the sky,)<br />
      That times to come should see the Trojan race<br />
      Her Carthage ruin, and her tow&rsquo;rs deface;<br />
      Nor thus confin&rsquo;d, the yoke of sov&rsquo;reign sway<br />
      Should on the necks of all the nations lay.<br />
      She ponder&rsquo;d this, and fear&rsquo;d it was in fate;<br />
      Nor could forget the war she wag&rsquo;d of late<br />
      For conqu&rsquo;ring Greece against the Trojan state.<br />
      Besides, long causes working in her mind,<br />
      And secret seeds of envy, lay behind;<br />
      Deep graven in her heart the doom remain&rsquo;d<br />
      Of partial Paris, and her form disdain&rsquo;d;<br />
      The grace bestow&rsquo;d on ravish&rsquo;d Ganymed,<br />
      Electra&rsquo;s glories, and her injur&rsquo;d bed.<br />
      Each was a cause alone; and all combin&rsquo;d<br />
      To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind.<br />
      For this, far distant from the Latian coast<br />
      She drove the remnants of the Trojan host;<br />
      And sev&rsquo;n long years th&rsquo; unhappy wand&rsquo;ring train<br />
      Were toss&rsquo;d by storms, and scatter&rsquo;d thro&rsquo; the main.<br />
      Such time, such toil, requir&rsquo;d the Roman name,<br />
      Such length of labour for so vast a frame.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Now scarce the Trojan fleet, with sails and oars,<br />
      Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores,<br />
      Ent&rsquo;ring with cheerful shouts the wat&rsquo;ry reign,<br />
      And plowing frothy furrows in the main;<br />
      When, lab&rsquo;ring still with endless discontent,<br />
      The Queen of Heav&rsquo;n did thus her fury vent:<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;Then am I vanquish&rsquo;d? must I yield?&rdquo; said she,<br />
      &ldquo;And must the Trojans reign in Italy?<br />
      So Fate will have it, and Jove adds his force;<br />
      Nor can my pow&rsquo;r divert their happy course.<br />
      Could angry Pallas, with revengeful spleen,<br />
      The Grecian navy burn, and drown the men?<br />
      She, for the fault of one offending foe,<br />
      The bolts of Jove himself presum&rsquo;d to throw:<br />
      With whirlwinds from beneath she toss&rsquo;d the ship,<br />
      And bare expos&rsquo;d the bosom of the deep;<br />
      Then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game,<br />
      The wretch, yet hissing with her father&rsquo;s flame,<br />
      She strongly seiz&rsquo;d, and with a burning wound<br />
      Transfix&rsquo;d, and naked, on a rock she bound.<br />
      But I, who walk in awful state above,<br />
      The majesty of heav&rsquo;n, the sister wife of Jove,<br />
      For length of years my fruitless force employ<br />
      Against the thin remains of ruin&rsquo;d Troy!<br />
      What nations now to Juno&rsquo;s pow&rsquo;r will pray,<br />
      Or off&rsquo;rings on my slighted altars lay?&rdquo;<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Thus rag&rsquo;d the goddess; and, with fury fraught.<br />
      The restless regions of the storms she sought,<br />
      Where, in a spacious cave of living stone,<br />
      The tyrant Aeolus, from his airy throne,<br />
      With pow&rsquo;r imperial curbs the struggling winds,<br />
      And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds.<br />
      This way and that th&rsquo; impatient captives tend,<br />
      And, pressing for release, the mountains rend.<br />
      High in his hall th&rsquo; undaunted monarch stands,<br />
      And shakes his scepter, and their rage commands;<br />
      Which did he not, their unresisted sway<br />
      Would sweep the world before them in their way;<br />
      Earth, air, and seas thro&rsquo; empty space would roll,<br />
      And heav&rsquo;n would fly before the driving soul.<br />
      In fear of this, the Father of the Gods<br />
      Confin&rsquo;d their fury to those dark abodes,<br />
      And lock&rsquo;d &rsquo;em safe within, oppress&rsquo;d with mountain loads;<br />
      Impos&rsquo;d a king, with arbitrary sway,<br />
      To loose their fetters, or their force allay.<br />
      To whom the suppliant queen her pray&rsquo;rs address&rsquo;d,<br />
      And thus the tenor of her suit express&rsquo;d:<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;O Aeolus! for to thee the King of Heav&rsquo;n<br />
      The pow&rsquo;r of tempests and of winds has giv&rsquo;n;<br />
      Thy force alone their fury can restrain,<br />
      And smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main.<br />
      A race of wand&rsquo;ring slaves, abhorr&rsquo;d by me,<br />
      With prosp&rsquo;rous passage cut the Tuscan sea;<br />
      To fruitful Italy their course they steer,<br />
      And for their vanquish&rsquo;d gods design new temples there.<br />
      Raise all thy winds; with night involve the skies;<br />
      Sink or disperse my fatal enemies.<br />
      Twice sev&rsquo;n, the charming daughters of the main,<br />
      Around my person wait, and bear my train:<br />
      Succeed my wish, and second my design;<br />
      The fairest, Deiopeia, shall be thine,<br />
      And make thee father of a happy line.&rdquo;<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      To this the god: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis yours, O queen, to will<br />
      The work which duty binds me to fulfil.<br />
      These airy kingdoms, and this wide command,<br />
      Are all the presents of your bounteous hand:<br />
      Yours is my sov&rsquo;reign&rsquo;s grace; and, as your guest,<br />
      I sit with gods at their celestial feast;<br />
      Raise tempests at your pleasure, or subdue;<br />
      Dispose of empire, which I hold from you.&rdquo;<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      He said, and hurl&rsquo;d against the mountain side<br />
      His quiv&rsquo;ring spear, and all the god applied.<br />
      The raging winds rush thro&rsquo; the hollow wound,<br />
      And dance aloft in air, and skim along the ground;<br />
      Then, settling on the sea, the surges sweep,<br />
      Raise liquid mountains, and disclose the deep.<br />
      South, East, and West with mix&rsquo;d confusion roar,<br />
      And roll the foaming billows to the shore.<br />
      The cables crack; the sailors&rsquo; fearful cries<br />
      Ascend; and sable night involves the skies;<br />
      And heav&rsquo;n itself is ravish&rsquo;d from their eyes.<br />
      Loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue;<br />
      Then flashing fires the transient light renew;<br />
      The face of things a frightful image bears,<br />
      And present death in various forms appears.<br />
      Struck with unusual fright, the Trojan chief,<br />
      With lifted hands and eyes, invokes relief;<br />
      And, &ldquo;Thrice and four times happy those,&rdquo; he cried,<br />
      &ldquo;That under Ilian walls before their parents died!<br />
      Tydides, bravest of the Grecian train!<br />
      Why could not I by that strong arm be slain,<br />
      And lie by noble Hector on the plain,<br />
      Or great Sarpedon, in those bloody fields<br />
      Where Simois rolls the bodies and the shields<br />
      Of heroes, whose dismember&rsquo;d hands yet bear<br />
      The dart aloft, and clench the pointed spear!&rdquo;<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails,<br />
      Fierce Boreas drove against his flying sails,<br />
      And rent the sheets; the raging billows rise,<br />
      And mount the tossing vessels to the skies:<br />
      Nor can the shiv&rsquo;ring oars sustain the blow;<br />
      The galley gives her side, and turns her prow;<br />
      While those astern, descending down the steep,<br />
      Thro&rsquo; gaping waves behold the boiling deep.<br />
      Three ships were hurried by the southern blast,<br />
      And on the secret shelves with fury cast.<br />
      Those hidden rocks th&rsquo; Ausonian sailors knew:<br />
      They call&rsquo;d them Altars, when they rose in view,<br />
      And show&rsquo;d their spacious backs above the flood.<br />
      Three more fierce Eurus, in his angry mood,<br />
      Dash&rsquo;d on the shallows of the moving sand,<br />
      And in mid ocean left them moor&rsquo;d a-land.<br />
      Orontes&rsquo; bark, that bore the Lycian crew,<br />
      (A horrid sight!) ev&rsquo;n in the hero&rsquo;s view,<br />
      From stem to stern by waves was overborne:<br />
      The trembling pilot, from his rudder torn,<br />
      Was headlong hurl&rsquo;d; thrice round the ship was toss&rsquo;d,<br />
      Then bulg&rsquo;d at once, and in the deep was lost;<br />
      And here and there above the waves were seen<br />
      Arms, pictures, precious goods, and floating men.<br />
      The stoutest vessel to the storm gave way,<br />
      And suck&rsquo;d thro&rsquo; loosen&rsquo;d planks the rushing sea.<br />
      Ilioneus was her chief: Alethes old,<br />
      Achates faithful, Abas young and bold,<br />
      Endur&rsquo;d not less; their ships, with gaping seams,<br />
      Admit the deluge of the briny streams.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Meantime imperial Neptune heard the sound<br />
      Of raging billows breaking on the ground.<br />
      Displeas&rsquo;d, and fearing for his wat&rsquo;ry reign,<br />
      He rear&rsquo;d his awful head above the main,<br />
      Serene in majesty; then roll&rsquo;d his eyes<br />
      Around the space of earth, and seas, and skies.<br />
      He saw the Trojan fleet dispers&rsquo;d, distress&rsquo;d,<br />
      By stormy winds and wintry heav&rsquo;n oppress&rsquo;d.<br />
      Full well the god his sister&rsquo;s envy knew,<br />
      And what her aims and what her arts pursue.<br />
      He summon&rsquo;d Eurus and the western blast,<br />
      And first an angry glance on both he cast;<br />
      Then thus rebuk&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Audacious winds! from whence<br />
      This bold attempt, this rebel insolence?<br />
      Is it for you to ravage seas and land,<br />
      Unauthoriz&rsquo;d by my supreme command?<br />
      To raise such mountains on the troubled main?<br />
      Whom I&mdash;but first &rsquo;tis fit the billows to restrain;<br />
      And then you shall be taught obedience to my reign.<br />
      Hence! to your lord my royal mandate bear,<br />
      The realms of ocean and the fields of air<br />
      Are mine, not his. By fatal lot to me<br />
      The liquid empire fell, and trident of the sea.<br />
      His pow&rsquo;r to hollow caverns is confin&rsquo;d:<br />
      There let him reign, the jailer of the wind,<br />
      With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call,<br />
      And boast and bluster in his empty hall.&rdquo;<br />
      He spoke; and, while he spoke, he smooth&rsquo;d the sea,<br />
      Dispell&rsquo;d the darkness, and restor&rsquo;d the day.<br />
      Cymothoe, Triton, and the sea-green train<br />
      Of beauteous nymphs, the daughters of the main,<br />
      Clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands:<br />
      The god himself with ready trident stands,<br />
      And opes the deep, and spreads the moving sands;<br />
      Then heaves them off the shoals. Where&rsquo;er he guides<br />
      His finny coursers and in triumph rides,<br />
      The waves unruffle and the sea subsides.<br />
      As, when in tumults rise th&rsquo; ignoble crowd,<br />
      Mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud;<br />
      And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly,<br />
      And all the rustic arms that fury can supply:<br />
      If then some grave and pious man appear,<br />
      They hush their noise, and lend a list&rsquo;ning ear;<br />
      He soothes with sober words their angry mood,<br />
      And quenches their innate desire of blood:<br />
      So, when the Father of the Flood appears,<br />
      And o&rsquo;er the seas his sov&rsquo;reign trident rears,<br />
      Their fury falls: he skims the liquid plains,<br />
      High on his chariot, and, with loosen&rsquo;d reins,<br />
      Majestic moves along, and awful peace maintains.<br />
      The weary Trojans ply their shatter&rsquo;d oars<br />
      To nearest land, and make the Libyan shores.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Within a long recess there lies a bay:<br />
      An island shades it from the rolling sea,<br />
      And forms a port secure for ships to ride;<br />
      Broke by the jutting land, on either side,<br />
      In double streams the briny waters glide.<br />
      Betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene<br />
      Appears above, and groves for ever green:<br />
      A grot is form&rsquo;d beneath, with mossy seats,<br />
      To rest the Nereids, and exclude the heats.<br />
      Down thro&rsquo; the crannies of the living walls<br />
      The crystal streams descend in murm&rsquo;ring falls:<br />
      No haulsers need to bind the vessels here,<br />
      Nor bearded anchors; for no storms they fear.<br />
      Sev&rsquo;n ships within this happy harbour meet,<br />
      The thin remainders of the scatter&rsquo;d fleet.<br />
      The Trojans, worn with toils, and spent with woes,<br />
      Leap on the welcome land, and seek their wish&rsquo;d repose.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      First, good Achates, with repeated strokes<br />
      Of clashing flints, their hidden fire provokes:<br />
      Short flame succeeds; a bed of wither&rsquo;d leaves<br />
      The dying sparkles in their fall receives:<br />
      Caught into life, in fiery fumes they rise,<br />
      And, fed with stronger food, invade the skies.<br />
      The Trojans, dropping wet, or stand around<br />
      The cheerful blaze, or lie along the ground:<br />
      Some dry their corn, infected with the brine,<br />
      Then grind with marbles, and prepare to dine.<br />
      Aeneas climbs the mountain&rsquo;s airy brow,<br />
      And takes a prospect of the seas below,<br />
      If Capys thence, or Antheus he could spy,<br />
      Or see the streamers of Caicus fly.<br />
      No vessels were in view; but, on the plain,<br />
      Three beamy stags command a lordly train<br />
      Of branching heads: the more ignoble throng<br />
      Attend their stately steps, and slowly graze along.<br />
      He stood; and, while secure they fed below,<br />
      He took the quiver and the trusty bow<br />
      Achates us&rsquo;d to bear: the leaders first<br />
      He laid along, and then the vulgar pierc&rsquo;d;<br />
      Nor ceas&rsquo;d his arrows, till the shady plain<br />
      Sev&rsquo;n mighty bodies with their blood distain.<br />
      For the sev&rsquo;n ships he made an equal share,<br />
      And to the port return&rsquo;d, triumphant from the war.<br />
      The jars of gen&rsquo;rous wine (Acestes&rsquo; gift,<br />
      When his Trinacrian shores the navy left)<br />
      He set abroach, and for the feast prepar&rsquo;d,<br />
      In equal portions with the ven&rsquo;son shar&rsquo;d.<br />
      Thus while he dealt it round, the pious chief<br />
      With cheerful words allay&rsquo;d the common grief:<br />
      &ldquo;Endure, and conquer! Jove will soon dispose<br />
      To future good our past and present woes.<br />
      With me, the rocks of Scylla you have tried;<br />
      Th&rsquo; inhuman Cyclops and his den defied.<br />
      What greater ills hereafter can you bear?<br />
      Resume your courage and dismiss your care,<br />
      An hour will come, with pleasure to relate<br />
      Your sorrows past, as benefits of Fate.<br />
      Thro&rsquo; various hazards and events, we move<br />
      To Latium and the realms foredoom&rsquo;d by Jove.<br />
      Call&rsquo;d to the seat (the promise of the skies)<br />
      Where Trojan kingdoms once again may rise,<br />
      Endure the hardships of your present state;<br />
      Live, and reserve yourselves for better fate.&rdquo;<br />

      These words he spoke, but spoke not from his heart;<br />
      His outward smiles conceal&rsquo;d his inward smart.<br />
      The jolly crew, unmindful of the past,<br />
      The quarry share, their plenteous dinner haste.<br />
      Some strip the skin; some portion out the spoil;<br />
      The limbs, yet trembling, in the caldrons boil;<br />
      Some on the fire the reeking entrails broil.<br />
      Stretch&rsquo;d on the grassy turf, at ease they dine,<br />
      Restore their strength with meat, and cheer their souls with wine.<br />
      Their hunger thus appeas&rsquo;d, their care attends<br />
      The doubtful fortune of their absent friends:<br />
      Alternate hopes and fears their minds possess,<br />

      Meantime, in shades of night Aeneas lies:<br />
      Care seiz&rsquo;d his soul, and sleep forsook his eyes.<br />
      But, when the sun restor&rsquo;d the cheerful day,<br />
      He rose, the coast and country to survey,<br />
      Anxious and eager to discover more.<br />
      It look&rsquo;d a wild uncultivated shore;<br />
      But, whether humankind, or beasts alone<br />
      Possess&rsquo;d the new-found region, was unknown.<br />
      Beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides:<br />
      Tall trees surround the mountain&rsquo;s shady sides;<br />
      The bending brow above a safe retreat provides.<br />
      Arm&rsquo;d with two pointed darts, he leaves his friends,<br />
      And true Achates on his steps attends.<br />
      Lo! in the deep recesses of the wood,<br />
      Before his eyes his goddess mother stood:<br />
      A huntress in her habit and her mien;<br />
      Her dress a maid, her air confess&rsquo;d a queen.<br />
      Bare were her knees, and knots her garments bind;<br />
      Loose was her hair, and wanton&rsquo;d in the wind;<br />
      Her hand sustain&rsquo;d a bow; her quiver hung behind.<br />
      She seem&rsquo;d a virgin of the Spartan blood:<br />
      With such array Harpalyce bestrode<br />
      Her Thracian courser and outstripp&rsquo;d the rapid flood.<br />
      &ldquo;Ho, strangers! have you lately seen,&rdquo; she said,<br />
      &ldquo;One of my sisters, like myself array&rsquo;d,<br />
      Who cross&rsquo;d the lawn, or in the forest stray&rsquo;d?<br />
      A painted quiver at her back she bore;<br />
      Varied with spots, a lynx&rsquo;s hide she wore;<br />
      And at full cry pursued the tusky boar.&rdquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Thus Venus: thus her son replied again:<br />

      Your voice and mien celestial birth betray!<br />
      If, as you seem, the sister of the day,<br />
      Or one at least of chaste Diana&rsquo;s train,<br />
      Let not an humble suppliant sue in vain;<br />
      But tell a stranger, long in tempests toss&rsquo;d,<br />
      What earth we tread, and who commands the coast?<br />
      Then on your name shall wretched mortals call,<br />
      And offer&rsquo;d victims at your altars fall.&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;I dare not,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;assume the name<br />
      Of goddess, or celestial honours claim:<br />
      For Tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear,<br />
      And purple buskins o&rsquo;er their ankles wear.<br />
      Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are:<br />
      A people rude in peace, and rough in war.<br />
      The rising city, which from far you see,<br />
      Is Carthage, and a Tyrian colony.<br />
      Phoenician Dido rules the growing state,<br />
      Who fled from Tyre, to shun her brother&rsquo;s hate.<br />
      Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate;<br />
      Which I will sum in short. Sichaeus, known<br />
      For wealth, and brother to the Punic throne,<br />
      Possess&rsquo;d fair Dido&rsquo;s bed; and either heart<br />
      At once was wounded with an equal dart.<br />
      Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid;<br />
      Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway&rsquo;d:<br />
      One who condemn&rsquo;d divine and human laws.<br />
      Then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause.<br />
      The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth,<br />
      With steel invades his brother&rsquo;s life by stealth;<br />
      Before the sacred altar made him bleed,<br />
      And long from her conceal&rsquo;d the cruel deed.<br />
      Some tale, some new pretence, he daily coin&rsquo;d,<br />
      To soothe his sister, and delude her mind.<br />
      At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears<br />
      Of her unhappy lord: the spectre stares,<br />
      And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares.<br />
      The cruel altars and his fate he tells,<br />
      And the dire secret of his house reveals,<br />
      Then warns the widow, with her household gods,<br />
      To seek a refuge in remote abodes.<br />
      Last, to support her in so long a way,<br />
      He shows her where his hidden treasure lay.<br />
      Admonish&rsquo;d thus, and seiz&rsquo;d with mortal fright,<br />
      The queen provides companions of her flight:<br />
      They meet, and all combine to leave the state,<br />
      Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate.<br />
      They seize a fleet, which ready rigg&rsquo;d they find;<br />
      Nor is Pygmalion&rsquo;s treasure left behind.<br />
      The vessels, heavy laden, put to sea<br />
      With prosp&rsquo;rous winds; a woman leads the way.<br />
      I know not, if by stress of weather driv&rsquo;n,<br />
      Or was their fatal course dispos&rsquo;d by Heav&rsquo;n;<br />
      At last they landed, where from far your eyes<br />
      May view the turrets of new Carthage rise;<br />
      There bought a space of ground, which Byrsa call&rsquo;d,<br />
      From the bull&rsquo;s hide, they first inclos&rsquo;d, and wall&rsquo;d.<br />
      But whence are you? what country claims your birth?<br />
      What seek you, strangers, on our Libyan earth?&rdquo;<br />

      While Fortune favour&rsquo;d, not unknown to fame.<br />
      My household gods, companions of my woes,<br />
      With pious care I rescued from our foes.<br />
      To fruitful Italy my course was bent;<br />
      And from the King of Heav&rsquo;n is my descent.<br />
      With twice ten sail I cross&rsquo;d the Phrygian sea;<br />
      Fate and my mother goddess led my way.<br />
      Scarce sev&rsquo;n, the thin remainders of my fleet,<br />
      From storms preserv&rsquo;d, within your harbour meet.<br />
      Myself distress&rsquo;d, an exile, and unknown,<br />

      And widely spread ambrosial scents around:<br />
      In length of train descends her sweeping gown;<br />
      And, by her graceful walk, the Queen of Love is known.<br />
      The prince pursued the parting deity<br />
      With words like these: &ldquo;Ah! whither do you fly?<br />
      Unkind and cruel! to deceive your son<br />
      In borrow&rsquo;d shapes, and his embrace to shun;<br />
      Never to bless my sight, but thus unknown;<br />
      And still to speak in accents not your own.&rdquo;<br />
      Against the goddess these complaints he made,<br />
      But took the path, and her commands obey&rsquo;d.<br />
      They march, obscure; for Venus kindly shrouds<br />
      With mists their persons, and involves in clouds,<br />
      That, thus unseen, their passage none might stay,<br />
      Or force to tell the causes of their way.<br />
      This part perform&rsquo;d, the goddess flies sublime<br />
      To visit Paphos and her native clime;<br />
      Where garlands, ever green and ever fair,<br />
      With vows are offer&rsquo;d, and with solemn pray&rsquo;r:<br />
      A hundred altars in her temple smoke;<br />
      A thousand bleeding hearts her pow&rsquo;r invoke.<br />

      Some laws ordain; and some attend the choice<br />
      Of holy senates, and elect by voice.<br />
      Here some design a mole, while others there<br />
      Lay deep foundations for a theatre;<br />
      From marble quarries mighty columns hew,<br />
      For ornaments of scenes, and future view.<br />
      Such is their toil, and such their busy pains,<br />

      All with united force, combine to drive<br />

      Their lofty tow&rsquo;rs; then, ent&rsquo;ring at the gate,<br />
      Conceal&rsquo;d in clouds (prodigious to relate)<br />
      He mix&rsquo;d, unmark&rsquo;d, among the busy throng,<br />

      The striving artists, and their arts&rsquo; renown;<br />
      He saw, in order painted on the wall,<br />
      Whatever did unhappy Troy befall:<br />
      The wars that fame around the world had blown,<br />
      All to the life, and ev&rsquo;ry leader known.<br />
      There Agamemnon, Priam here, he spies,<br />
      And fierce Achilles, who both kings defies.<br />
      He stopp&rsquo;d, and weeping said: &ldquo;O friend! ev&rsquo;n here<br />
      The monuments of Trojan woes appear!<br />
      Our known disasters fill ev&rsquo;n foreign lands:<br />
      See there, where old unhappy Priam stands!<br />
      Ev&rsquo;n the mute walls relate the warrior&rsquo;s fame,<br />
      And Trojan griefs the Tyrians&rsquo; pity claim.&rdquo;<br />
      He said, his tears a ready passage find,<br />
      Devouring what he saw so well design&rsquo;d,<br />
      And with an empty picture fed his mind:<br />
      For there he saw the fainting Grecians yield,<br />
      And here the trembling Trojans quit the field,<br />
      Pursued by fierce Achilles thro&rsquo; the plain,<br />
      On his high chariot driving o&rsquo;er the slain.<br />
      The tents of Rhesus next, his grief renew,<br />
      By their white sails betray&rsquo;d to nightly view;<br />
      And wakeful Diomede, whose cruel sword<br />
      The sentries slew, nor spar&rsquo;d their slumb&rsquo;ring lord,<br />
      Then took the fiery steeds, ere yet the food<br />
      Of Troy they taste, or drink the Xanthian flood.<br />
      Elsewhere he saw where Troilus defied<br />
      Achilles, and unequal combat tried;<br />
      Then, where the boy disarm&rsquo;d, with loosen&rsquo;d reins,<br />
      Was by his horses hurried o&rsquo;er the plains,<br />
      Hung by the neck and hair, and dragg&rsquo;d around:<br />
      The hostile spear, yet sticking in his wound,<br />
      With tracks of blood inscrib&rsquo;d the dusty ground.<br />
      Meantime the Trojan dames, oppress&rsquo;d with woe,<br />
      To Pallas&rsquo; fane in long procession go,<br />
      In hopes to reconcile their heav&rsquo;nly foe.<br />
      They weep, they beat their breasts, they rend their hair,<br />
      And rich embroider&rsquo;d vests for presents bear;<br />
      But the stern goddess stands unmov&rsquo;d with pray&rsquo;r.<br />
      Thrice round the Trojan walls Achilles drew<br />
      The corpse of Hector, whom in fight he slew.<br />
      Here Priam sues; and there, for sums of gold,<br />
      The lifeless body of his son is sold.<br />
      So sad an object, and so well express&rsquo;d,<br />
      Drew sighs and groans from the griev&rsquo;d hero&rsquo;s breast,<br />
      To see the figure of his lifeless friend,<br />
      And his old sire his helpless hand extend.<br />
      Himself he saw amidst the Grecian train,<br />
      Mix&rsquo;d in the bloody battle on the plain;<br />
      And swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew,<br />
      His pompous ensigns, and his Indian crew.<br />
      Penthisilea there, with haughty grace,<br />
      Leads to the wars an Amazonian race:<br />
      In their right hands a pointed dart they wield;<br />
      The left, for ward, sustains the lunar shield.<br />
      Athwart her breast a golden belt she throws,<br />
      Amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes,<br />
      And dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Thus while the Trojan prince employs his eyes,<br />
      Fix&rsquo;d on the walls with wonder and surprise,<br />
      The beauteous Dido, with a num&rsquo;rous train<br />
      And pomp of guards, ascends the sacred fane.<br />
      Such on Eurotas&rsquo; banks, or Cynthus&rsquo; height,<br />
      Diana seems; and so she charms the sight,<br />
      When in the dance the graceful goddess leads<br />
      The choir of nymphs, and overtops their heads:<br />
      Known by her quiver, and her lofty mien,<br />
      She walks majestic, and she looks their queen;<br />
      Latona sees her shine above the rest,<br />
      And feeds with secret joy her silent breast.<br />
      Such Dido was; with such becoming state,<br />
      Amidst the crowd, she walks serenely great.<br />
      Their labour to her future sway she speeds,<br />
      And passing with a gracious glance proceeds;<br />
      Then mounts the throne, high plac&rsquo;d before the shrine:<br />
      In crowds around, the swarming people join.<br />
      She takes petitions, and dispenses laws,<br />
      Hears and determines ev&rsquo;ry private cause;<br />
      Their tasks in equal portions she divides,<br />
      And, where unequal, there by lots decides.<br />
      Another way by chance Aeneas bends<br />
      His eyes, and unexpected sees his friends,<br />
      Antheus, Sergestus grave, Cloanthus strong,<br />
      And at their backs a mighty Trojan throng,<br />
      Whom late the tempest on the billows toss&rsquo;d,<br />
      And widely scatter&rsquo;d on another coast.<br />
      The prince, unseen, surpris&rsquo;d with wonder stands,<br />
      And longs, with joyful haste, to join their hands;<br />
      But, doubtful of the wish&rsquo;d event, he stays,<br />
      And from the hollow cloud his friends surveys,<br />
      Impatient till they told their present state,<br />
      And where they left their ships, and what their fate,<br />
      And why they came, and what was their request;<br />
      For these were sent, commission&rsquo;d by the rest,<br />
      To sue for leave to land their sickly men,<br />
      And gain admission to the gracious queen.<br />
      Ent&rsquo;ring, with cries they fill&rsquo;d the holy fane;<br />
      Then thus, with lowly voice, Ilioneus began:<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;O Queen! indulg&rsquo;d by favour of the gods<br />
      To found an empire in these new abodes,<br />
      To build a town, with statutes to restrain<br />
      The wild inhabitants beneath thy reign,<br />
      We wretched Trojans, toss&rsquo;d on ev&rsquo;ry shore,<br />
      From sea to sea, thy clemency implore.<br />
      Forbid the fires our shipping to deface!<br />
      Receive th&rsquo; unhappy fugitives to grace,<br />
      And spare the remnant of a pious race!<br />
      We come not with design of wasteful prey,<br />
      To drive the country, force the swains away:<br />
      Nor such our strength, nor such is our desire;<br />
      The vanquish&rsquo;d dare not to such thoughts aspire.<br />
      A land there is, Hesperia nam&rsquo;d of old;<br />
      The soil is fruitful, and the men are bold<br />
      Th&rsquo; Oenotrians held it once, by common fame<br />
      Now call&rsquo;d Italia, from the leader&rsquo;s name.<br />
      To that sweet region was our voyage bent,<br />
      When winds and ev&rsquo;ry warring element<br />
      Disturb&rsquo;d our course, and, far from sight of land,<br />
      Cast our torn vessels on the moving sand:<br />
      The sea came on; the South, with mighty roar,<br />
      Dispers&rsquo;d and dash&rsquo;d the rest upon the rocky shore.<br />
      Those few you see escap&rsquo;d the storm, and fear,<br />
      Unless you interpose, a shipwreck here.<br />
      What men, what monsters, what inhuman race,<br />
      What laws, what barb&rsquo;rous customs of the place,<br />
      Shut up a desert shore to drowning men,<br />
      And drive us to the cruel seas again?<br />
      If our hard fortune no compassion draws,<br />
      Nor hospitable rights, nor human laws,<br />
      The gods are just, and will revenge our cause.<br />
      Aeneas was our prince: a juster lord,<br />
      Or nobler warrior, never drew a sword;<br />
      Observant of the right, religious of his word.<br />
      If yet he lives, and draws this vital air,<br />
      Nor we, his friends, of safety shall despair;<br />
      Nor you, great queen, these offices repent,<br />
      Which he will equal, and perhaps augment.<br />
      We want not cities, nor Sicilian coasts,<br />
      Where King Acestes Trojan lineage boasts.<br />
      Permit our ships a shelter on your shores,<br />
      Refitted from your woods with planks and oars,<br />
      That, if our prince be safe, we may renew<br />
      Our destin&rsquo;d course, and Italy pursue.<br />
      But if, O best of men, the Fates ordain<br />
      That thou art swallow&rsquo;d in the Libyan main,<br />
      And if our young Iulus be no more,<br />
      Dismiss our navy from your friendly shore,<br />
      That we to good Acestes may return,<br />
      And with our friends our common losses mourn.&rdquo;<br />
      Thus spoke Ilioneus: the Trojan crew<br />
      With cries and clamours his request renew.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      The modest queen a while, with downcast eyes,<br />
      Ponder&rsquo;d the speech; then briefly thus replies:<br />
      &ldquo;Trojans, dismiss your fears; my cruel fate,<br />
      And doubts attending an unsettled state,<br />
      Force me to guard my coast from foreign foes.<br />
      Who has not heard the story of your woes,<br />
      The name and fortune of your native place,<br />
      The fame and valour of the Phrygian race?<br />
      We Tyrians are not so devoid of sense,<br />
      Nor so remote from Phoebus&rsquo; influence.<br />
      Whether to Latian shores your course is bent,<br />
      Or, driv&rsquo;n by tempests from your first intent,<br />
      You seek the good Acestes&rsquo; government,<br />
      Your men shall be receiv&rsquo;d, your fleet repair&rsquo;d,<br />
      And sail, with ships of convoy for your guard:<br />
      Or, would you stay, and join your friendly pow&rsquo;rs<br />
      To raise and to defend the Tyrian tow&rsquo;rs,<br />
      My wealth, my city, and myself are yours.<br />
      And would to Heav&rsquo;n, the Storm, you felt, would bring<br />
      On Carthaginian coasts your wand&rsquo;ring king.<br />
      My people shall, by my command, explore<br />
      The ports and creeks of ev&rsquo;ry winding shore,<br />
      And towns, and wilds, and shady woods, in quest<br />

      Rais&rsquo;d in his mind the Trojan hero stood,<br />

      &ldquo;From whence, O goddess-born, this long delay?<br />
      What more can you desire, your welcome sure,<br />
      Your fleet in safety, and your friends secure?<br />

      Like polish&rsquo;d ivory, beauteous to behold,<br />
      Or Parian marble, when enchas&rsquo;d in gold:<br />
      Thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke,<br />

      Who, scatter&rsquo;d thro&rsquo; the world, in exile mourn?<br />
      The gods, if gods to goodness are inclin&rsquo;d;<br />
      If acts of mercy touch their heav&rsquo;nly mind,<br />
      And, more than all the gods, your gen&rsquo;rous heart.<br />
      Conscious of worth, requite its own desert!<br />
      In you this age is happy, and this earth,<br />

      And fire with love the proud Phoenician&rsquo;s heart:<br />
      A love so violent, so strong, so sure,<br />
      As neither age can change, nor art can cure.<br />
      How this may be perform&rsquo;d, now take my mind:<br />
      Ascanius by his father is design&rsquo;d<br />
      To come, with presents laden, from the port,<br />
      To gratify the queen, and gain the court.<br />
      I mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep,<br />
      And, ravish&rsquo;d, in Idalian bow&rsquo;rs to keep,<br />
      Or high Cythera, that the sweet deceit<br />
      May pass unseen, and none prevent the cheat.<br />
      Take thou his form and shape. I beg the grace<br />
      But only for a night&rsquo;s revolving space:<br />
      Thyself a boy, assume a boy&rsquo;s dissembled face;<br />
      That when, amidst the fervour of the feast,<br />
      The Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast,<br />
      And with sweet kisses in her arms constrains,<br />
      Thou may&rsquo;st infuse thy venom in her veins.&rdquo;<br />
      The God of Love obeys, and sets aside<br />
      His bow and quiver, and his plumy pride;<br />
      He walks Iulus in his mother&rsquo;s sight,<br />
      And in the sweet resemblance takes delight.<br />

      His rosy-colour&rsquo;d cheeks, his radiant eyes,<br />
      His motions, voice, and shape, and all the god&rsquo;s disguise;<br />
      Nor pass unprais&rsquo;d the vest and veil divine,<br />
      Which wand&rsquo;ring foliage and rich flow&rsquo;rs entwine.<br />
      But, far above the rest, the royal dame,<br />
      (Already doom&rsquo;d to love&rsquo;s disastrous flame,)<br />
      With eyes insatiate, and tumultuous joy,<br />
      Beholds the presents, and admires the boy.<br />
      The guileful god about the hero long,<br />
      With children&rsquo;s play, and false embraces, hung;<br />
      Then sought the queen: she took him to her arms<br />
      With greedy pleasure, and devour&rsquo;d his charms.<br />
      Unhappy Dido little thought what guest,<br />
      How dire a god, she drew so near her breast;<br />
      But he, not mindless of his mother&rsquo;s pray&rsquo;r,<br />
      Works in the pliant bosom of the fair,<br />
      And moulds her heart anew, and blots her former care.<br />
      The dead is to the living love resign&rsquo;d;<br />

      A golden bowl, that shone with gems divine,<br />
      The queen commanded to be crown&rsquo;d with wine:<br />
      The bowl that Belus us&rsquo;d, and all the Tyrian line.<br />
      Then, silence thro&rsquo; the hall proclaim&rsquo;d, she spoke:<br />
      &ldquo;O hospitable Jove! we thus invoke,<br />
      With solemn rites, thy sacred name and pow&rsquo;r;<br />
      Bless to both nations this auspicious hour!<br />
      So may the Trojan and the Tyrian line<br />
      In lasting concord from this day combine.<br />
      Thou, Bacchus, god of joys and friendly cheer,<br />
      And gracious Juno, both be present here!<br />
      And you, my lords of Tyre, your vows address<br />
      To Heav&rsquo;n with mine, to ratify the peace.&rdquo;<br />
      The goblet then she took, with nectar crown&rsquo;d<br />
      (Sprinkling the first libations on the ground,)<br />
      And rais&rsquo;d it to her mouth with sober grace;<br />
      Then, sipping, offer&rsquo;d to the next in place.<br />
      &rsquo;Twas Bitias whom she call&rsquo;d, a thirsty soul;<br />
      He took the challenge, and embrac&rsquo;d the bowl,<br />
      With pleasure swill&rsquo;d the gold, nor ceas&rsquo;d to draw,<br />
      Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw.<br />
      The goblet goes around: Iopas brought<br />
      His golden lyre, and sung what ancient Atlas taught:<br />
      The various labours of the wand&rsquo;ring moon,<br />
      And whence proceed th&rsquo; eclipses of the sun;<br />
      Th&rsquo; original of men and beasts; and whence<br />
      The rains arise, and fires their warmth dispense,<br />
      And fix&rsquo;d and erring stars dispose their influence;<br />
      What shakes the solid earth; what cause delays<br />
      The summer nights and shortens winter days.<br />
      With peals of shouts the Tyrians praise the song:<br />
      Those peals are echo&rsquo;d by the Trojan throng.<br />
      Th&rsquo; unhappy queen with talk prolong&rsquo;d the night,<br />
      And drank large draughts of love with vast delight;<br />
      Of Priam much enquir&rsquo;d, of Hector more;<br />
      Then ask&rsquo;d what arms the swarthy Memnon wore,<br />
      What troops he landed on the Trojan shore;<br />
      The steeds of Diomede varied the discourse,<br />
      And fierce Achilles, with his matchless force;<br />
      At length, as fate and her ill stars requir&rsquo;d,<br />
      To hear the series of the war desir&rsquo;d.<br />
      &ldquo;Relate at large, my godlike guest,&rdquo; she said,<br />
      &ldquo;The Grecian stratagems, the town betray&rsquo;d:<br />
      The fatal issue of so long a war,<br />
      Your flight, your wand&rsquo;rings, and your woes, declare;<br />
      For, since on ev&rsquo;ry sea, on ev&rsquo;ry coast,<br />
      Your men have been distress&rsquo;d, your navy toss&rsquo;d,<br />
      Sev&rsquo;n times the sun has either tropic view&rsquo;d,<br />
      The winter banish&rsquo;d, and the spring renew&rsquo;d.&rdquo;<br />

    <h5> THE ARGUMENT. </h5>
    
    <p>
      Aeneas relates how the city of Troy was taken, after a ten years&rsquo; siege,
      by the treachery of Sinon, and the stratagem of a wooden horse. He declares
      the fixed resolution he had taken not to survive the ruin of his country, and
      the various adventures he met with in defence of it. At last, having been before
      advised by Hector&rsquo;s ghost, and now by the appearance of his mother Venus,
      he is prevailed upon to leave the town, and settle his household gods in another
      country. In order to this, he carries off his father on his shoulders, and leads
      his little son by the hand, his wife following behind. When he comes to the
      place appointed for the general rendezvous, he finds a great confluence of 
      people, but misses his wife, whose ghost afterwards appears to him, and tells
      him the land which was designed for him.

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;By destiny compell&rsquo;d, and in despair,<br />
      The Greeks grew weary of the tedious war,<br />
      And by Minerva&rsquo;s aid a fabric rear&rsquo;d,<br />
      Which like a steed of monstrous height appear&rsquo;d:<br />
      The sides were plank&rsquo;d with pine; they feign&rsquo;d it made<br />
      For their return, and this the vow they paid.<br />
      Thus they pretend, but in the hollow side<br />
      Selected numbers of their soldiers hide:<br />
      With inward arms the dire machine they load,<br />
      And iron bowels stuff the dark abode.<br />
      In sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an isle<br />
      (While Fortune did on Priam&rsquo;s empire smile)<br />
      Renown&rsquo;d for wealth; but, since, a faithless bay,<br />
      Where ships expos&rsquo;d to wind and weather lay.<br />
      There was their fleet conceal&rsquo;d. We thought, for Greece<br />
      Their sails were hoisted, and our fears release.<br />
      The Trojans, coop&rsquo;d within their walls so long,<br />
      Unbar their gates, and issue in a throng,<br />
      Like swarming bees, and with delight survey<br />
      The camp deserted, where the Grecians lay:<br />
      The quarters of the sev&rsquo;ral chiefs they show&rsquo;d;<br />
      Here Phoenix, here Achilles, made abode;<br />
      Here join&rsquo;d the battles; there the navy rode.<br />
      Part on the pile their wond&rsquo;ring eyes employ:<br />
      The pile by Pallas rais&rsquo;d to ruin Troy.<br />
      Thymoetes first (&rsquo;tis doubtful whether hir&rsquo;d,<br />
      Or so the Trojan destiny requir&rsquo;d)<br />
      Mov&rsquo;d that the ramparts might be broken down,<br />
      To lodge the monster fabric in the town.<br />
      But Capys, and the rest of sounder mind,<br />
      The fatal present to the flames designed,<br />
      Or to the wat&rsquo;ry deep; at least to bore<br />
      The hollow sides, and hidden frauds explore.<br />
      The giddy vulgar, as their fancies guide,<br />
      With noise say nothing, and in parts divide.<br />
      Laocoon, follow&rsquo;d by a num&rsquo;rous crowd,<br />
      Ran from the fort, and cried, from far, aloud:<br />
      &lsquo;O wretched countrymen! what fury reigns?<br />
      What more than madness has possess&rsquo;d your brains?<br />
      Think you the Grecians from your coasts are gone?<br />
      And are Ulysses&rsquo; arts no better known?<br />
      This hollow fabric either must inclose,<br />
      Within its blind recess, our secret foes;<br />
      Or &rsquo;tis an engine rais&rsquo;d above the town,<br />
      T&rsquo; o&rsquo;erlook the walls, and then to batter down.<br />
      Somewhat is sure design&rsquo;d, by fraud or force:<br />
      Trust not their presents, nor admit the horse.&rsquo;<br />
      Thus having said, against the steed he threw<br />
      His forceful spear, which, hissing as it flew,<br />
      Pierc&rsquo;d thro&rsquo; the yielding planks of jointed wood,<br />
      And trembling in the hollow belly stood.<br />
      The sides, transpierc&rsquo;d, return a rattling sound,<br />
      And groans of Greeks inclos&rsquo;d come issuing thro&rsquo; the wound<br />
      And, had not Heav&rsquo;n the fall of Troy design&rsquo;d,<br />
      Or had not men been fated to be blind,<br />
      Enough was said and done t&rsquo;inspire a better mind.<br />
      Then had our lances pierc&rsquo;d the treach&rsquo;rous wood,<br />
      And Ilian tow&rsquo;rs and Priam&rsquo;s empire stood.<br />
      Meantime, with shouts, the Trojan shepherds bring<br />
      A captive Greek, in bands, before the king;<br />
      Taken to take; who made himself their prey,<br />
      T&rsquo; impose on their belief, and Troy betray;<br />
      Fix&rsquo;d on his aim, and obstinately bent<br />
      To die undaunted, or to circumvent.<br />
      About the captive, tides of Trojans flow;<br />
      All press to see, and some insult the foe.<br />
      Now hear how well the Greeks their wiles disguis&rsquo;d;<br />
      Behold a nation in a man compris&rsquo;d.<br />
      Trembling the miscreant stood, unarm&rsquo;d and bound;<br />
      He star&rsquo;d, and roll&rsquo;d his haggard eyes around,<br />
      Then said: &lsquo;Alas! what earth remains, what sea<br />
      Is open to receive unhappy me?<br />
      What fate a wretched fugitive attends,<br />
      Scorn&rsquo;d by my foes, abandon&rsquo;d by my friends?&rsquo;<br />
      He said, and sigh&rsquo;d, and cast a rueful eye:<br />
      Our pity kindles, and our passions die.<br />
      We cheer the youth to make his own defence,<br />
      And freely tell us what he was, and whence:<br />
      What news he could impart, we long to know,<br />
      And what to credit from a captive foe.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;His fear at length dismiss&rsquo;d, he said: &lsquo;Whate&rsquo;er<br />
      My fate ordains, my words shall be sincere:<br />
      I neither can nor dare my birth disclaim;<br />
      Greece is my country, Sinon is my name.<br />
      Tho&rsquo; plung&rsquo;d by Fortune&rsquo;s pow&rsquo;r in misery,<br />
      &rsquo;Tis not in Fortune&rsquo;s pow&rsquo;r to make me lie.<br />
      If any chance has hither brought the name<br />
      Of Palamedes, not unknown to fame,<br />
      Who suffer&rsquo;d from the malice of the times,<br />
      Accus&rsquo;d and sentenc&rsquo;d for pretended crimes,<br />
      Because these fatal wars he would prevent;<br />
      Whose death the wretched Greeks too late lament;<br />
      Me, then a boy, my father, poor and bare<br />
      Of other means, committed to his care,<br />
      His kinsman and companion in the war.<br />
      While Fortune favour&rsquo;d, while his arms support<br />
      The cause, and rul&rsquo;d the counsels, of the court,<br />
      I made some figure there; nor was my name<br />
      Obscure, nor I without my share of fame.<br />
      But when Ulysses, with fallacious arts,<br />
      Had made impression in the people&rsquo;s hearts,<br />
      And forg&rsquo;d a treason in my patron&rsquo;s name<br />
      (I speak of things too far divulg&rsquo;d by fame),<br />
      My kinsman fell. Then I, without support,<br />
      In private mourn&rsquo;d his loss, and left the court.<br />
      Mad as I was, I could not bear his fate<br />
      With silent grief, but loudly blam&rsquo;d the state,<br />
      And curs&rsquo;d the direful author of my woes.<br />
      &rsquo;Twas told again; and hence my ruin rose.<br />
      I threaten&rsquo;d, if indulgent Heav&rsquo;n once more<br />
      Would land me safely on my native shore,<br />
      His death with double vengeance to restore.<br />
      This mov&rsquo;d the murderer&rsquo;s hate; and soon ensued<br />
      Th&rsquo; effects of malice from a man so proud.<br />
      Ambiguous rumours thro&rsquo; the camp he spread,<br />
      And sought, by treason, my devoted head;<br />
      New crimes invented; left unturn&rsquo;d no stone,<br />
      To make my guilt appear, and hide his own;<br />
      Till Calchas was by force and threat&rsquo;ning wrought:<br />
      But why&mdash;why dwell I on that anxious thought?<br />
      If on my nation just revenge you seek,<br />
      And &rsquo;tis t&rsquo; appear a foe, t&rsquo; appear a Greek;<br />
      Already you my name and country know;<br />
      Assuage your thirst of blood, and strike the blow:<br />
      My death will both the kingly brothers please,<br />
      And set insatiate Ithacus at ease.&rsquo;<br />
      This fair unfinish&rsquo;d tale, these broken starts,<br />
      Rais&rsquo;d expectations in our longing hearts:<br />
      Unknowing as we were in Grecian arts.<br />
      His former trembling once again renew&rsquo;d,<br />
      With acted fear, the villain thus pursued:<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Long had the Grecians (tir&rsquo;d with fruitless care,<br />
      And wearied with an unsuccessful war)<br />
      Resolv&rsquo;d to raise the siege, and leave the town;<br />
      And, had the gods permitted, they had gone;<br />
      But oft the wintry seas and southern winds<br />
      Withstood their passage home, and chang&rsquo;d their minds.<br />
      Portents and prodigies their souls amaz&rsquo;d;<br />
      But most, when this stupendous pile was rais&rsquo;d:<br />
      Then flaming meteors, hung in air, were seen,<br />
      And thunders rattled thro&rsquo; a sky serene.<br />
      Dismay&rsquo;d, and fearful of some dire event,<br />
      Eurypylus t&rsquo; enquire their fate was sent.<br />
      He from the gods this dreadful answer brought:<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;O Grecians, when the Trojan shores you sought,<br />
      Your passage with a virgin&rsquo;s blood was bought:<br />
      So must your safe return be bought again,<br />
      And Grecian blood once more atone the main.&rdquo;<br />
      The spreading rumour round the people ran;<br />
      All fear&rsquo;d, and each believ&rsquo;d himself the man.<br />
      Ulysses took th&rsquo; advantage of their fright;<br />
      Call&rsquo;d Calchas, and produc&rsquo;d in open sight:<br />
      Then bade him name the wretch, ordain&rsquo;d by fate<br />
      The public victim, to redeem the state.<br />
      Already some presag&rsquo;d the dire event,<br />
      And saw what sacrifice Ulysses meant.<br />
      For twice five days the good old seer withstood<br />
      Th&rsquo; intended treason, and was dumb to blood,<br />
      Till, tir&rsquo;d, with endless clamours and pursuit<br />
      Of Ithacus, he stood no longer mute;<br />
      But, as it was agreed, pronounc&rsquo;d that I<br />
      Was destin&rsquo;d by the wrathful gods to die.<br />
      All prais&rsquo;d the sentence, pleas&rsquo;d the storm should fall<br />
      On one alone, whose fury threaten&rsquo;d all.<br />
      The dismal day was come; the priests prepare<br />
      Their leaven&rsquo;d cakes, and fillets for my hair.<br />
      I follow&rsquo;d nature&rsquo;s laws, and must avow<br />
      I broke my bonds and fled the fatal blow.<br />
      Hid in a weedy lake all night I lay,<br />
      Secure of safety when they sail&rsquo;d away.<br />
      But now what further hopes for me remain,<br />
      To see my friends, or native soil, again;<br />
      My tender infants, or my careful sire,<br />
      Whom they returning will to death require;<br />
      Will perpetrate on them their first design,<br />
      And take the forfeit of their heads for mine?<br />
      Which, O! if pity mortal minds can move,<br />
      If there be faith below, or gods above,<br />
      If innocence and truth can claim desert,<br />
      Ye Trojans, from an injur&rsquo;d wretch avert.&rsquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;False tears true pity move; the king commands<br />
      To loose his fetters, and unbind his hands:<br />
      Then adds these friendly words: &lsquo;Dismiss thy fears;<br />
      Forget the Greeks; be mine as thou wert theirs.<br />
      But truly tell, was it for force or guile,<br />
      Or some religious end, you rais&rsquo;d the pile?&rsquo;<br />
      Thus said the king. He, full of fraudful arts,<br />
      This well-invented tale for truth imparts:<br />
      &lsquo;Ye lamps of heav&rsquo;n!&rsquo; he said, and lifted high<br />
      His hands now free, &lsquo;thou venerable sky!<br />
      Inviolable pow&rsquo;rs, ador&rsquo;d with dread!<br />
      Ye fatal fillets, that once bound this head!<br />
      Ye sacred altars, from whose flames I fled!<br />

      Without a crime, th&rsquo; ungrateful Greeks betray,<br />
      Reveal the secrets of the guilty state,<br />

      The Grecian hopes, and all th&rsquo; attempts they made,<br />
      Were only founded on Minerva&rsquo;s aid.<br />
      But from the time when impious Diomede,<br />
      And false Ulysses, that inventive head,<br />
      Her fatal image from the temple drew,<br />
      The sleeping guardians of the castle slew,<br />
      Her virgin statue with their bloody hands<br />
      Polluted, and profan&rsquo;d her holy bands;<br />
      From thence the tide of fortune left their shore,<br />
      And ebb&rsquo;d much faster than it flow&rsquo;d before:<br />
      Their courage languish&rsquo;d, as their hopes decay&rsquo;d;<br />
      And Pallas, now averse, refus&rsquo;d her aid.<br />
      Nor did the goddess doubtfully declare<br />
      Her alter&rsquo;d mind and alienated care.<br />
      When first her fatal image touch&rsquo;d the ground,<br />
      She sternly cast her glaring eyes around,<br />
      That sparkled as they roll&rsquo;d, and seem&rsquo;d to threat:<br />
      Her heav&rsquo;nly limbs distill&rsquo;d a briny sweat.<br />
      Thrice from the ground she leap&rsquo;d, was seen to wield<br />
      Her brandish&rsquo;d lance, and shake her horrid shield.<br />
      Then Calchas bade our host for flight<br />
      And hope no conquest from the tedious war,<br />
      Till first they sail&rsquo;d for Greece; with pray&rsquo;rs besought<br />
      Her injur&rsquo;d pow&rsquo;r, and better omens brought.<br />
      And now their navy plows the wat&rsquo;ry main,<br />
      Yet soon expect it on your shores again,<br />
      With Pallas pleas&rsquo;d; as Calchas did ordain.<br />
      But first, to reconcile the blue-ey&rsquo;d maid<br />
      For her stol&rsquo;n statue and her tow&rsquo;r betray&rsquo;d,<br />
      Warn&rsquo;d by the seer, to her offended name<br />
      We rais&rsquo;d and dedicate this wondrous frame,<br />
      So lofty, lest thro&rsquo; your forbidden gates<br />
      It pass, and intercept our better fates:<br />
      For, once admitted there, our hopes are lost;<br />
      And Troy may then a new Palladium boast;<br />
      For so religion and the gods ordain,<br />
      That, if you violate with hands profane<br />
      Minerva&rsquo;s gift, your town in flames shall burn,<br />
      (Which omen, O ye gods, on Grecia turn!)<br />
      But if it climb, with your assisting hands,<br />
      The Trojan walls, and in the city stands;<br />
      Then Troy shall Argos and Mycenae burn,<br />

      &ldquo;A greater omen, and of worse portent,<br />
      Did our unwary minds with fear torment,<br />
      Concurring to produce the dire event.<br />
      Laocoon, Neptune&rsquo;s priest by lot that year,<br />
      With solemn pomp then sacrific&rsquo;d a steer;<br />
      When, dreadful to behold, from sea we spied<br />
      Two serpents, rank&rsquo;d abreast, the seas divide,<br />
      And smoothly sweep along the swelling tide.<br />
      Their flaming crests above the waves they show;<br />
      Their bellies seem to burn the seas below;<br />
      Their speckled tails advance to steer their course,<br />
      And on the sounding shore the flying billows force.<br />
      And now the strand, and now the plain they held;<br />
      Their ardent eyes with bloody streaks were fill&rsquo;d;<br />
      Their nimble tongues they brandish&rsquo;d as they came,<br />
      And lick&rsquo;d their hissing jaws, that sputter&rsquo;d flame.<br />
      We fled amaz&rsquo;d; their destin&rsquo;d way they take,<br />
      And to Laocoon and his children make;<br />
      And first around the tender boys they wind,<br />
      Then with their sharpen&rsquo;d fangs their limbs and bodies grind.<br />
      The wretched father, running to their aid<br />
      With pious haste, but vain, they next invade;<br />
      Twice round his waist their winding volumes roll&rsquo;d;<br />
      And twice about his gasping throat they fold.<br />
      The priest thus doubly chok&rsquo;d, their crests divide,<br />
      And tow&rsquo;ring o&rsquo;er his head in triumph ride.<br />
      With both his hands he labours at the knots;<br />
      His holy fillets the blue venom blots;<br />
      His roaring fills the flitting air around.<br />
      Thus, when an ox receives a glancing wound,<br />
      He breaks his bands, the fatal altar flies,<br />
      And with loud bellowings breaks the yielding skies.<br />
      Their tasks perform&rsquo;d, the serpents quit their prey,<br />
      And to the tow&rsquo;r of Pallas make their way:<br />
      Couch&rsquo;d at her feet, they lie protected there<br />
      By her large buckler and protended spear.<br />
      Amazement seizes all; the gen&rsquo;ral cry<br />
      Proclaims Laocoon justly doom&rsquo;d to die,<br />
      Whose hand the will of Pallas had withstood,<br />
      And dared to violate the sacred wood.<br />
      All vote t&rsquo; admit the steed, that vows be paid<br />
      And incense offer&rsquo;d to th&rsquo; offended maid.<br />
      A spacious breach is made; the town lies bare;<br />
      Some hoisting levers, some the wheels prepare<br />
      And fasten to the horse&rsquo;s feet; the rest<br />
      With cables haul along th&rsquo; unwieldly beast.<br />
      Each on his fellow for assistance calls;<br />
      At length the fatal fabric mounts the walls,<br />
      Big with destruction. Boys with chaplets crown&rsquo;d,<br />
      And choirs of virgins, sing and dance around.<br />
      Thus rais&rsquo;d aloft, and then descending down,<br />
      It enters o&rsquo;er our heads, and threats the town.<br />
      O sacred city, built by hands divine!<br />
      O valiant heroes of the Trojan line!<br />
      Four times he struck: as oft the clashing sound<br />
      Of arms was heard, and inward groans rebound.<br />
      Yet, mad with zeal, and blinded with our fate,<br />
      We haul along the horse in solemn state;<br />
      Then place the dire portent within the tow&rsquo;r.<br />
      Cassandra cried, and curs&rsquo;d th&rsquo; unhappy hour;<br />
      Foretold our fate; but, by the god&rsquo;s decree,<br />
      All heard, and none believ&rsquo;d the prophecy.<br />
      With branches we the fanes adorn, and waste,<br />
      In jollity, the day ordain&rsquo;d to be the last.<br />
      Meantime the rapid heav&rsquo;ns roll&rsquo;d down the light,<br />
      And on the shaded ocean rush&rsquo;d the night;<br />
      Our men, secure, nor guards nor sentries held,<br />
      But easy sleep their weary limbs compell&rsquo;d.<br />
      The Grecians had embark&rsquo;d their naval pow&rsquo;rs<br />
      From Tenedos, and sought our well-known shores,<br />
      Safe under covert of the silent night,<br />
      And guided by th&rsquo; imperial galley&rsquo;s light;<br />
      When Sinon, favour&rsquo;d by the partial gods,<br />
      Unlock&rsquo;d the horse, and op&rsquo;d his dark abodes;<br />
      Restor&rsquo;d to vital air our hidden foes,<br />
      Who joyful from their long confinement rose.<br />
      Tysander bold, and Sthenelus their guide,<br />
      And dire Ulysses down the cable slide:<br />
      Then Thoas, Athamas, and Pyrrhus haste;<br />
      Nor was the Podalirian hero last,<br />
      Nor injur&rsquo;d Menelaus, nor the fam&rsquo;d<br />
      Epeus, who the fatal engine fram&rsquo;d.<br />
      A nameless crowd succeed; their forces join<br />
      T&rsquo; invade the town, oppress&rsquo;d with sleep and wine.<br />
      Those few they find awake first meet their fate;<br />
      Then to their fellows they unbar the gate.<br />

      &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas in the dead of night, when sleep repairs<br />
      Our bodies worn with toils, our minds with cares,<br />
      When Hector&rsquo;s ghost before my sight appears:<br />
      A bloody shroud he seem&rsquo;d, and bath&rsquo;d in tears;<br />
      Such as he was, when, by Pelides slain,<br />
      Thessalian coursers dragg&rsquo;d him o&rsquo;er the plain.<br />
      Swoln were his feet, as when the thongs were thrust<br />
      Thro&rsquo; the bor&rsquo;d holes; his body black with dust;<br />
      Unlike that Hector who return&rsquo;d from toils<br />
      Of war, triumphant, in Aeacian spoils,<br />
      Or him who made the fainting Greeks retire,<br />
      And launch&rsquo;d against their navy Phrygian fire.<br />
      His hair and beard stood stiffen&rsquo;d with his gore;<br />
      And all the wounds he for his country bore<br />
      Now stream&rsquo;d afresh, and with new purple ran.<br />
      I wept to see the visionary man,<br />
      And, while my trance continued, thus began:<br />
      &lsquo;O light of Trojans, and support of Troy,<br />
      Thy father&rsquo;s champion, and thy country&rsquo;s joy!<br />
      O, long expected by thy friends! from whence<br />
      Art thou so late return&rsquo;d for our defence?<br />
      Do we behold thee, wearied as we are<br />
      With length of labours, and with toils of war?<br />
      After so many fun&rsquo;rals of thy own<br />
      Art thou restor&rsquo;d to thy declining town?<br />
      But say, what wounds are these? What new disgrace<br />
      Deforms the manly features of thy face?&rsquo;<br />

      &ldquo;To this the spectre no reply did frame,<br />

      This warning in these mournful words express&rsquo;d:<br />
      &lsquo;O goddess-born! escape, by timely flight,<br />
      The flames and horrors of this fatal night.<br />
      The foes already have possess&rsquo;d the wall;<br />
      Troy nods from high, and totters to her fall.<br />
      Enough is paid to Priam&rsquo;s royal name,<br />
      More than enough to duty and to fame.<br />
      If by a mortal hand my father&rsquo;s throne<br />
      Could be defended, &rsquo;twas by mine alone.<br />
      Now Troy to thee commends her future state,<br />

      Which, wand&rsquo;ring long, at last thou shalt erect.&rsquo;<br />

      &ldquo;Now peals of shouts come thund&rsquo;ring from afar,<br />
      Cries, threats, and loud laments, and mingled war:<br />
      The noise approaches, tho&rsquo; our palace stood<br />
      Aloof from streets, encompass&rsquo;d with a wood.<br />
      Louder, and yet more loud, I hear th&rsquo; alarms<br />
      Of human cries distinct, and clashing arms.<br />
      Fear broke my slumbers; I no longer stay,<br />
      But mount the terrace, thence the town survey,<br />
      And hearken what the frightful sounds convey.<br />
      Thus, when a flood of fire by wind is borne,<br />
      Crackling it rolls, and mows the standing corn;<br />
      Or deluges, descending on the plains,<br />
      Sweep o&rsquo;er the yellow year, destroy the pains<br />
      Of lab&rsquo;ring oxen and the peasant&rsquo;s gains;<br />
      Unroot the forest oaks, and bear away<br />
      Flocks, folds, and trees, and undistinguish&rsquo;d prey:<br />
      The shepherd climbs the cliff, and sees from far<br />
      The wasteful ravage of the wat&rsquo;ry war.<br />
      Then Hector&rsquo;s faith was manifestly clear&rsquo;d,<br />
      And Grecian frauds in open light appear&rsquo;d.<br />
      The palace of Deiphobus ascends<br />
      In smoky flames, and catches on his friends.<br />
      Ucalegon burns next: the seas are bright<br />
      With splendour not their own, and shine with Trojan light.<br />
      New clamours and new clangours now arise,<br />
      The sound of trumpets mix&rsquo;d with fighting cries.<br />
      With frenzy seiz&rsquo;d, I run to meet th&rsquo; alarms,<br />
      Resolv&rsquo;d on death, resolv&rsquo;d to die in arms,<br />
      But first to gather friends, with them t&rsquo; oppose<br />
      If fortune favour&rsquo;d, and repel the foes;<br />
      Spurr&rsquo;d by my courage, by my country fir&rsquo;d,<br />
      With sense of honour and revenge inspir&rsquo;d.<br />

      &ldquo;Pantheus, Apollo&rsquo;s priest, a sacred name,<br />
      Had scap&rsquo;d the Grecian swords, and pass&rsquo;d the flame:<br />
      With relics loaden, to my doors he fled,<br />
      And by the hand his tender grandson led.<br />
      &lsquo;What hope, O Pantheus? whither can we run?<br />
      Where make a stand? and what may yet be done?&rsquo;<br />
      Scarce had I said, when Pantheus, with a groan:<br />
      &lsquo;Troy is no more, and Ilium was a town!<br />
      The fatal day, th&rsquo; appointed hour, is come,<br />
      When wrathful Jove&rsquo;s irrevocable doom<br />
      Transfers the Trojan state to Grecian hands.<br />
      The fire consumes the town, the foe commands;<br />
      And armed hosts, an unexpected force,<br />
      Break from the bowels of the fatal horse.<br />
      Within the gates, proud Sinon throws about<br />
      The flames; and foes for entrance press without,<br />
      With thousand others, whom I fear to name,<br />
      More than from Argos or Mycenae came.<br />
      To sev&rsquo;ral posts their parties they divide;<br />
      Some block the narrow streets, some scour the wide:<br />
      The bold they kill, th&rsquo; unwary they surprise;<br />
      Who fights finds death, and death finds him who flies.<br />
      The warders of the gate but scarce maintain<br />
      Th&rsquo; unequal combat, and resist in vain.&rsquo;<br />

      &ldquo;I heard; and Heav&rsquo;n, that well-born souls inspires,<br />
      Prompts me thro&rsquo; lifted swords and rising fires<br />
      To run where clashing arms and clamour calls,<br />
      And rush undaunted to defend the walls.<br />
      Ripheus and Iph&rsquo;itas by my side engage,<br />
      For valour one renown&rsquo;d, and one for age.<br />
      Dymas and Hypanis by moonlight knew<br />
      My motions and my mien, and to my party drew;<br />
      With young Coroebus, who by love was led<br />
      To win renown and fair Cassandra&rsquo;s bed,<br />
      And lately brought his troops to Priam&rsquo;s aid,<br />
      Forewarn&rsquo;d in vain by the prophetic maid.<br />
      Whom when I saw resolv&rsquo;d in arms to fall,<br />
      And that one spirit animated all:<br />
      &lsquo;Brave souls!&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;but brave, alas! in vain:<br />
      Come, finish what our cruel fates ordain.<br />
      You see the desp&rsquo;rate state of our affairs,<br />
      And heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s protecting pow&rsquo;rs are deaf to pray&rsquo;rs.<br />
      The passive gods behold the Greeks defile<br />
      Their temples, and abandon to the spoil<br />
      Their own abodes: we, feeble few, conspire<br />
      To save a sinking town, involv&rsquo;d in fire.<br />
      Then let us fall, but fall amidst our foes:<br />
      Despair of life the means of living shows.&rsquo;<br />
      So bold a speech incourag&rsquo;d their desire<br />
      Of death, and added fuel to their fire.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;As hungry wolves, with raging appetite,<br />
      Scour thro&rsquo; the fields, nor fear the stormy night;<br />
      Their whelps at home expect the promis&rsquo;d food,<br />
      And long to temper their dry chaps in blood:<br />
      So rush&rsquo;d we forth at once; resolv&rsquo;d to die,<br />
      Resolv&rsquo;d, in death, the last extremes to try.<br />
      We leave the narrow lanes behind, and dare<br />
      Th&rsquo; unequal combat in the public square:<br />
      Night was our friend; our leader was despair.<br />
      What tongue can tell the slaughter of that night?<br />
      What eyes can weep the sorrows and affright?<br />
      An ancient and imperial city falls:<br />
      The streets are fill&rsquo;d with frequent funerals;<br />
      Houses and holy temples float in blood,<br />
      And hostile nations make a common flood.<br />
      Not only Trojans fall; but, in their turn,<br />
      The vanquish&rsquo;d triumph, and the victors mourn.<br />
      Ours take new courage from despair and night:<br />
      Confus&rsquo;d the fortune is, confus&rsquo;d the fight.<br />
      All parts resound with tumults, plaints, and fears;<br />
      And grisly Death in sundry shapes appears.<br />
      Androgeos fell among us, with his band,<br />
      Who thought us Grecians newly come to land.<br />
      &lsquo;From whence,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;my friends, this long delay?<br />
      You loiter, while the spoils are borne away:<br />
      Our ships are laden with the Trojan store;<br />
      And you, like truants, come too late ashore.&rsquo;<br />
      He said, but soon corrected his mistake,<br />
      Found, by the doubtful answers which we make:<br />
      Amaz&rsquo;d, he would have shunn&rsquo;d th&rsquo; unequal fight;<br />
      But we, more num&rsquo;rous, intercept his flight.<br />
      As when some peasant, in a bushy brake,<br />
      Has with unwary footing press&rsquo;d a snake;<br />
      He starts aside, astonish&rsquo;d, when he spies<br />
      His rising crest, blue neck, and rolling eyes;<br />
      So from our arms surpris&rsquo;d Androgeos flies.<br />
      In vain; for him and his we compass&rsquo;d round,<br />
      Possess&rsquo;d with fear, unknowing of the ground,<br />
      And of their lives an easy conquest found.<br />
      Thus Fortune on our first endeavor smil&rsquo;d.<br />
      Coroebus then, with youthful hopes beguil&rsquo;d,<br />
      Swoln with success, and a daring mind,<br />
      This new invention fatally design&rsquo;d.<br />
      &lsquo;My friends,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;since Fortune shows the way,<br />
      &rsquo;Tis fit we should th&rsquo; auspicious guide obey.<br />
      For what has she these Grecian arms bestow&rsquo;d,<br />
      But their destruction, and the Trojans&rsquo; good?<br />
      Then change we shields, and their devices bear:<br />
      Let fraud supply the want of force in war.<br />
      They find us arms.&rsquo; This said, himself he dress&rsquo;d<br />
      In dead Androgeos&rsquo; spoils, his upper vest,<br />
      His painted buckler, and his plumy crest.<br />
      Thus Ripheus, Dymas, all the Trojan train,<br />
      Lay down their own attire, and strip the slain.<br />
      Mix&rsquo;d with the Greeks, we go with ill presage,<br />
      Flatter&rsquo;d with hopes to glut our greedy rage;<br />
      Unknown, assaulting whom we blindly meet,<br />
      And strew with Grecian carcasses the street.<br />
      Thus while their straggling parties we defeat,<br />
      Some to the shore and safer ships retreat;<br />
      And some, oppress&rsquo;d with more ignoble fear,<br />
      Remount the hollow horse, and pant in secret there.<br />

      We run to die, or disengage the king.<br />
      So hot th&rsquo; assault, so high the tumult rose,<br />

      To Hector&rsquo;s wife, while Priam held the throne,<br />
      Thro&rsquo; which she brought Astyanax, unseen,<br />
      To cheer his grandsire and his grandsire&rsquo;s queen.<br />
      Thro&rsquo; this we pass, and mount the tow&rsquo;r, from whence<br />
      With unavailing arms the Trojans make defence.<br />
      From this the trembling king had oft descried<br />

      Who slept the winter in a thorny brake,<br />
      And, casting off his slough when spring returns,<br />
      Now looks aloft, and with new glory burns;<br />
      Restor&rsquo;d with poisonous herbs, his ardent sides<br />

      And flaming firebrands to the roofs ascend.<br />
      Himself, among the foremost, deals his blows,<br />

      And all his father sparkles in his eyes;<br />
      Nor bars, nor fighting guards, his force sustain:<br />
      The bars are broken, and the guards are slain.<br />
      In rush the Greeks, and all the apartments fill;<br />
      Those few defendants whom they find, they kill.<br />
      Not with so fierce a rage the foaming flood<br />
      Roars, when he finds his rapid course withstood;<br />
      Bears down the dams with unresisted sway,<br />
      And sweeps the cattle and the cots away.<br />
      These eyes beheld him when he march&rsquo;d between<br />
      The brother kings: I saw th&rsquo; unhappy queen,<br />
      The hundred wives, and where old Priam stood,<br />
      To stain his hallow&rsquo;d altar with his brood.<br />
      The fifty nuptial beds (such hopes had he,<br />
      So large a promise, of a progeny),<br />
      The posts, of plated gold, and hung with spoils,<br />
      Fell the reward of the proud victor&rsquo;s toils.<br />
      Where&rsquo;er the raging fire had left a space,<br />
      The Grecians enter and possess the place.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;Perhaps you may of Priam&rsquo;s fate enquire.<br />
      He, when he saw his regal town on fire,<br />
      His ruin&rsquo;d palace, and his ent&rsquo;ring foes,<br />
      On ev&rsquo;ry side inevitable woes,<br />
      In arms, disus&rsquo;d, invests his limbs, decay&rsquo;d,<br />
      Like them, with age; a late and useless aid.<br />
      His feeble shoulders scarce the weight sustain;<br />
      Loaded, not arm&rsquo;d, he creeps along with pain,<br />
      Despairing of success, ambitious to be slain!<br />
      Uncover&rsquo;d but by heav&rsquo;n, there stood in view<br />
      An altar; near the hearth a laurel grew,<br />
      Dodder&rsquo;d with age, whose boughs encompass round<br />
      The household gods, and shade the holy ground.<br />
      Here Hecuba, with all her helpless train<br />
      Of dames, for shelter sought, but sought in vain.<br />
      Driv&rsquo;n like a flock of doves along the sky,<br />
      Their images they hug, and to their altars fly.<br />
      The Queen, when she beheld her trembling lord,<br />
      And hanging by his side a heavy sword,<br />
      &lsquo;What rage,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;has seiz&rsquo;d my husband&rsquo;s mind?<br />
      What arms are these, and to what use design&rsquo;d?<br />
      These times want other aids! Were Hector here,<br />
      Ev&rsquo;n Hector now in vain, like Priam, would appear.<br />
      With us, one common shelter thou shalt find,<br />
      Or in one common fate with us be join&rsquo;d.&rsquo;<br />
      She said, and with a last salute embrac&rsquo;d<br />
      The poor old man, and by the laurel plac&rsquo;d.<br />
      Behold! Polites, one of Priam&rsquo;s sons,<br />
      Pursued by Pyrrhus, there for safety runs.<br />
      Thro&rsquo; swords and foes, amaz&rsquo;d and hurt, he flies<br />
      Thro&rsquo; empty courts and open galleries.<br />
      Him Pyrrhus, urging with his lance, pursues,<br />
      And often reaches, and his thrusts renews.<br />
      The youth, transfix&rsquo;d, with lamentable cries,<br />
      Expires before his wretched parent&rsquo;s eyes:<br />
      Whom gasping at his feet when Priam saw,<br />
      The fear of death gave place to nature&rsquo;s law;<br />
      And, shaking more with anger than with age,<br />
      &lsquo;The gods,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;requite thy brutal rage!<br />
      As sure they will, barbarian, sure they must,<br />
      If there be gods in heav&rsquo;n, and gods be just:<br />
      Who tak&rsquo;st in wrongs an insolent delight;<br />
      With a son&rsquo;s death t&rsquo; infect a father&rsquo;s sight.<br />
      Not he, whom thou and lying fame conspire<br />
      To call thee his; not he, thy vaunted sire,<br />
      Thus us&rsquo;d my wretched age: the gods he fear&rsquo;d,<br />
      The laws of nature and of nations heard.<br />
      He cheer&rsquo;d my sorrows, and, for sums of gold,<br />
      The bloodless carcass of my Hector sold;<br />
      Pitied the woes a parent underwent,<br />
      And sent me back in safety from his tent.&rsquo;<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;This said, his feeble hand a javelin threw,<br />
      Which, flutt&rsquo;ring, seem&rsquo;d to loiter as it flew:<br />
      Just, and but barely, to the mark it held,<br />
      And faintly tinkled on the brazen shield.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;Then Pyrrhus thus: &lsquo;Go thou from me to fate,<br />
      And to my father my foul deeds relate.<br />
      Now die!&rsquo; With that he dragg&rsquo;d the trembling sire,<br />
      Slidd&rsquo;ring thro&rsquo; clotter&rsquo;d blood and holy mire,<br />
      (The mingled paste his murder&rsquo;d son had made,)<br />
      Haul&rsquo;d from beneath the violated shade,<br />
      And on the sacred pile the royal victim laid.<br />
      His right hand held his bloody falchion bare,<br />
      His left he twisted in his hoary hair;<br />
      Then, with a speeding thrust, his heart he found:<br />
      The lukewarm blood came rushing thro&rsquo; the wound,<br />
      And sanguine streams distain&rsquo;d the sacred ground.<br />
      Thus Priam fell, and shar&rsquo;d one common fate<br />
      With Troy in ashes, and his ruin&rsquo;d state:<br />
      He, who the scepter of all Asia sway&rsquo;d,<br />
      Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obey&rsquo;d.<br />
      On the bleak shore now lies th&rsquo; abandon&rsquo;d king,<br />
      A headless carcass, and a nameless thing.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;Then, not before, I felt my curdled blood<br />
      Congeal with fear, my hair with horror stood:<br />
      My father&rsquo;s image fill&rsquo;d my pious mind,<br />
      Lest equal years might equal fortune find.<br />
      Again I thought on my forsaken wife,<br />
      And trembled for my son&rsquo;s abandon&rsquo;d life.<br />
      I look&rsquo;d about, but found myself alone,<br />
      Deserted at my need! My friends were gone.<br />
      Some spent with toil, some with despair oppress&rsquo;d,<br />
      Leap&rsquo;d headlong from the heights; the flames consum&rsquo;d the rest.<br />
      Thus, wand&rsquo;ring in my way, without a guide,<br />
      The graceless Helen in the porch I spied<br />
      Of Vesta&rsquo;s temple; there she lurk&rsquo;d alone;<br />
      Muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown:<br />
      But, by the flames that cast their blaze around,<br />
      That common bane of Greece and Troy I found.<br />
      For Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword;<br />
      More dreads the vengeance of her injur&rsquo;d lord;<br />
      Ev&rsquo;n by those gods who refug&rsquo;d her abhorr&rsquo;d.<br />
      Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard,<br />
      Resolv&rsquo;d to give her guilt the due reward:<br />
      &lsquo;Shall she triumphant sail before the wind,<br />
      And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind?<br />
      Shall she her kingdom and her friends review,<br />
      In state attended with a captive crew,<br />
      While unreveng&rsquo;d the good old Priam falls,<br />
      And Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls?<br />
      For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood<br />
      Were swell&rsquo;d with bodies, and were drunk with blood?<br />
      &rsquo;Tis true, a soldier can small honour gain,<br />
      And boast no conquest, from a woman slain:<br />
      Yet shall the fact not pass without applause,<br />
      Of vengeance taken in so just a cause;<br />
      The punish&rsquo;d crime shall set my soul at ease,<br />
      And murm&rsquo;ring manes of my friends appease.&rsquo;<br />
      Thus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light<br />
      Spread o&rsquo;er the place; and, shining heav&rsquo;nly bright,<br />
      My mother stood reveal&rsquo;d before my sight<br />
      Never so radiant did her eyes appear;<br />
      Not her own star confess&rsquo;d a light so clear:<br />
      Great in her charms, as when on gods above<br />
      She looks, and breathes herself into their love.<br />
      She held my hand, the destin&rsquo;d blow to break;<br />
      Then from her rosy lips began to speak:<br />
      &lsquo;My son, from whence this madness, this neglect<br />
      Of my commands, and those whom I protect?<br />
      Why this unmanly rage? Recall to mind<br />
      Whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind.<br />
      Look if your helpless father yet survive,<br />
      Or if Ascanius or Creusa live.<br />
      Around your house the greedy Grecians err;<br />
      And these had perish&rsquo;d in the nightly war,<br />
      But for my presence and protecting care.<br />
      Not Helen&rsquo;s face, nor Paris, was in fault;<br />
      But by the gods was this destruction brought.<br />
      Now cast your eyes around, while I dissolve<br />
      The mists and films that mortal eyes involve,<br />
      Purge from your sight the dross, and make you see<br />
      The shape of each avenging deity.<br />
      Enlighten&rsquo;d thus, my just commands fulfil,<br />
      Nor fear obedience to your mother&rsquo;s will.<br />
      Where yon disorder&rsquo;d heap of ruin lies,<br />
      Stones rent from stones; where clouds of dust arise,<br />
      Amid that smother Neptune holds his place,<br />
      Below the wall&rsquo;s foundation drives his mace,<br />
      And heaves the building from the solid base.<br />
      Look where, in arms, imperial Juno stands<br />
      Full in the Scaean gate, with loud commands,<br />
      Urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands.<br />
      See! Pallas, of her snaky buckler proud,<br />
      Bestrides the tow&rsquo;r, refulgent thro&rsquo; the cloud:<br />
      See! Jove new courage to the foe supplies,<br />
      And arms against the town the partial deities.<br />
      Haste hence, my son; this fruitless labour end:<br />
      Haste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend:<br />
      Haste; and a mother&rsquo;s care your passage shall befriend.&rsquo;<br />
      She said, and swiftly vanish&rsquo;d from my sight,<br />
      Obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night.<br />
      I look&rsquo;d, I listen&rsquo;d; dreadful sounds I hear;<br />
      And the dire forms of hostile gods appear.<br />
      Troy sunk in flames I saw, nor could prevent;<br />
      And Ilium from its old foundations rent;<br />
      Rent like a mountain ash, which dar&rsquo;d the winds,<br />
      And stood the sturdy strokes of lab&rsquo;ring hinds.<br />
      About the roots the cruel ax resounds;<br />
      The stumps are pierc&rsquo;d with oft-repeated wounds:<br />
      The war is felt on high; the nodding crown<br />
      Now threats a fall, and throws the leafy honours down.<br />
      To their united force it yields, tho&rsquo; late,<br />
      And mourns with mortal groans th&rsquo; approaching fate:<br />
      The roots no more their upper load sustain;<br />
      But down she falls, and spreads a ruin thro&rsquo; the plain.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;Descending thence, I scape thro&rsquo; foes and fire:<br />

      Twice to have seen our Ilium overthrown.<br />
      Make haste to save the poor remaining crew,<br />
      And give this useless corpse a long adieu.<br />
      These weak old hands suffice to stop my breath;<br />
      At least the pitying foes will aid my death,<br />

      Intreat, pray, beg, and raise a doleful cry.<br />
      &lsquo;What, will he still persist, on death resolve,<br />
      And in his ruin all his house involve!&rsquo;<br />
      He still persists his reasons to maintain;<br />

      &ldquo;Urg&rsquo;d by despair, again I go to try<br />
      The fate of arms, resolv&rsquo;d in fight to die:<br />
      &lsquo;What hope remains, but what my death must give?<br />
      Can I, without so dear a father, live?<br />
      You term it prudence, what I baseness call:<br />
      Could such a word from such a parent fall?<br />
      If Fortune please, and so the gods ordain,<br />
      That nothing should of ruin&rsquo;d Troy remain,<br />

      The way to death is wide, th&rsquo; approaches near:<br />
      For soon relentless Pyrrhus will appear,<br />
      Reeking with Priam&rsquo;s blood: the wretch who slew<br />
      The son (inhuman) in the father&rsquo;s view,<br />
      And then the sire himself to the dire altar drew.<br />
      O goddess mother, give me back to Fate;<br />
      Your gift was undesir&rsquo;d, and came too late!<br />
      Did you, for this, unhappy me convey<br />
      Thro&rsquo; foes and fires, to see my house a prey?<br />
      Shall I my father, wife, and son behold,<br />
      Welt&rsquo;ring in blood, each other&rsquo;s arms infold?<br />

      While th&rsquo; other hand sustains my weighty shield,<br />
      And forth I rush to seek th&rsquo; abandon&rsquo;d field.<br />
      I went; but sad Creusa stopp&rsquo;d my way,<br />
      And cross the threshold in my passage lay,<br />
      Embrac&rsquo;d my knees, and, when I would have gone,<br />
      Shew&rsquo;d me my feeble sire and tender son:<br />
      &lsquo;If death be your design, at least,&rsquo; said she,<br />
      &lsquo;Take us along to share your destiny.<br />
      If any farther hopes in arms remain,<br />
      This place, these pledges of your love, maintain.<br />
      To whom do you expose your father&rsquo;s life,<br />
      Your son&rsquo;s, and mine, your now forgotten wife!&rsquo;<br />
      While thus she fills the house with clam&rsquo;rous cries,<br />
      Our hearing is diverted by our eyes:<br />
      For, while I held my son, in the short space<br />
      Betwixt our kisses and our last embrace;<br />
      Strange to relate, from young Iulus&rsquo; head<br />
      A lambent flame arose, which gently spread<br />
      Around his brows, and on his temples fed.<br />
      Amaz&rsquo;d, with running water we prepare<br />
      To quench the sacred fire, and slake his hair;<br />
      But old Anchises, vers&rsquo;d in omens, rear&rsquo;d<br />
      His hands to heav&rsquo;n, and this request preferr&rsquo;d:<br />
      &lsquo;If any vows, almighty Jove, can bend<br />
      Thy will; if piety can pray&rsquo;rs commend,<br />
      Confirm the glad presage which thou art pleas&rsquo;d to send.&rsquo;<br />
      Scarce had he said, when, on our left, we hear<br />
      A peal of rattling thunder roll in air:<br />
      There shot a streaming lamp along the sky,<br />
      Which on the winged lightning seem&rsquo;d to fly;<br />
      From o&rsquo;er the roof the blaze began to move,<br />
      And, trailing, vanish&rsquo;d in th&rsquo; Idaean grove.<br />
      It swept a path in heav&rsquo;n, and shone a guide,<br />

      Secure, and deeming all the danger past,<br />
      A frightful noise of trampling feet we hear.<br />
      My father, looking thro&rsquo; the shades, with fear,<br />

      Stung with my loss, and raving with despair,<br />

      My sire, my son, my country gods I left.<br />
      In shining armour once again I sheathe<br />

      Each passage, ev&rsquo;ry street I cross&rsquo;d before.<br />
      All things were full of horror and affright,<br />
      And dreadful ev&rsquo;n the silence of the night.<br />

      With some small glimpse of hope to find her there.<br />
      Instead of her, the cruel Greeks I met;<br />
      The house was fill&rsquo;d with foes, with flames beset.<br />
      Driv&rsquo;n on the wings of winds, whole sheets of fire,<br />
      Thro&rsquo; air transported, to the roofs aspire.<br />
      From thence to Priam&rsquo;s palace I resort,<br />
      And search the citadel and desert court.<br />
      Then, unobserv&rsquo;d, I pass by Juno&rsquo;s church:<br />
      A guard of Grecians had possess&rsquo;d the porch;<br />
      There Phoenix and Ulysses watch the prey,<br />
      And thither all the wealth of Troy convey:<br />
      The spoils which they from ransack&rsquo;d houses brought,<br />
      And golden bowls from burning altars caught,<br />
      The tables of the gods, the purple vests,<br />
      The people&rsquo;s treasure, and the pomp of priests.<br />
      A rank of wretched youths, with pinion&rsquo;d hands,<br />
      And captive matrons, in long order stands.<br />
      Then, with ungovern&rsquo;d madness, I proclaim,<br />
      Thro&rsquo; all the silent street, Creusa&rsquo;s name:<br />
      Creusa still I call; at length she hears,<br />
      And sudden thro&rsquo; the shades of night appears.<br />
      Appears, no more Creusa, nor my wife,<br />
      But a pale spectre, larger than the life.<br />
      Aghast, astonish&rsquo;d, and struck dumb with fear,<br />
      I stood; like bristles rose my stiffen&rsquo;d hair.<br />
      Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief<br />
      &lsquo;Nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief.<br />
      Desist, my much-lov&rsquo;d lord, t&rsquo; indulge your pain;<br />
      You bear no more than what the gods ordain.<br />
      My fates permit me not from hence to fly;<br />
      Nor he, the great controller of the sky.<br />
      Long wand&rsquo;ring ways for you the pow&rsquo;rs decree;<br />
      On land hard labours, and a length of sea.<br />
      Then, after many painful years are past,<br />
      On Latium&rsquo;s happy shore you shall be cast,<br />
      Where gentle Tiber from his bed beholds<br />
      The flow&rsquo;ry meadows, and the feeding folds.<br />
      There end your toils; and there your fates provide<br />
      A quiet kingdom, and a royal bride:<br />
      There fortune shall the Trojan line restore,<br />
      And you for lost Creusa weep no more.<br />
      Fear not that I shall watch, with servile shame,<br />
      Th&rsquo; imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame;<br />
      Or, stooping to the victor&rsquo;s lust, disgrace<br />
      My goddess mother, or my royal race.<br />
      And now, farewell! The parent of the gods<br />
      Restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes:<br />
      I trust our common issue to your care.&rsquo;<br />
      She said, and gliding pass&rsquo;d unseen in air.<br />
      I strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue;<br />
      And thrice about her neck my arms I flung,<br />
      And, thrice deceiv&rsquo;d, on vain embraces hung.<br />
      Light as an empty dream at break of day,<br />
      Or as a blast of wind, she rush&rsquo;d away.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;Thus having pass&rsquo;d the night in fruitless pain,<br />

      Of men and matrons mix&rsquo;d, of young and old;<br />
      A wretched exil&rsquo;d crew together brought,<br />
      With arms appointed, and with treasure fraught,<br />
      Resolv&rsquo;d, and willing, under my command,<br />
      To run all hazards both of sea and land.<br />
      The Morn began, from Ida, to display<br />
      Her rosy cheeks; and Phosphor led the day:<br />
      Before the gates the Grecians took their post,<br />

    <h5> THE ARGUMENT. </h5>
    
    <p>
      Aeneas proceeds in his relation: he gives an account of the fleet with which
      he sailed, and the success of his first voyage to Thrace. From thence he
      directs his course to Delos and asks the oracle what place the gods had
      appointed for his habitation. By a mistake of the oracle&rsquo;s answer, he
      settles in Crete. His household gods give him the true sense of the oracle
      in a dream. He follows their advice, and makes the best of his way for Italy.
      He is cast on several shores, and meets with very surprising adventures, till
      at length he lands on Sicily, where his father Anchises dies. This is the place
      which he was sailing from, when the tempest rose, and threw him upon the
      Carthaginian coast.

      Warn&rsquo;d by celestial omens, we retreat,<br />
      To seek in foreign lands a happier seat.<br />

      What place the gods for our repose assign&rsquo;d.<br />
      Friends daily flock; and scarce the kindly spring<br />
      Began to clothe the ground, and birds to sing,<br />

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;Against our coast appears a spacious land,<br />
      Which once the fierce Lycurgus did command,<br />
      Thracia the name; the people bold in war;<br />
      Vast are their fields, and tillage is their care,<br />
      A hospitable realm while Fate was kind,<br />
      With Troy in friendship and religion join&rsquo;d.<br />
      I land; with luckless omens, then adore<br />
      Their gods, and draw a line along the shore;<br />
      I lay the deep foundations of a wall,<br />
      And Aenos, nam&rsquo;d from me, the city call.<br />
      To Dionaean Venus vows are paid,<br />
      And all the pow&rsquo;rs that rising labours aid;<br />
      A bull on Jove&rsquo;s imperial altar laid.<br />
      Not far, a rising hillock stood in view;<br />
      Sharp myrtles on the sides, and cornels grew.<br />
      There, while I went to crop the sylvan scenes,<br />
      And shade our altar with their leafy greens,<br />
      I pull&rsquo;d a plant; with horror I relate<br />
      A prodigy so strange and full of fate.<br />
      The rooted fibers rose, and from the wound<br />
      Black bloody drops distill&rsquo;d upon the ground.<br />
      Mute and amaz&rsquo;d, my hair with terror stood;<br />
      Fear shrunk my sinews, and congeal&rsquo;d my blood.<br />
      Mann&rsquo;d once again, another plant I try:<br />
      That other gush&rsquo;d with the same sanguine dye.<br />
      Then, fearing guilt for some offence unknown,<br />
      With pray&rsquo;rs and vows the Dryads I atone,<br />
      With all the sisters of the woods, and most<br />
      The God of Arms, who rules the Thracian coast,<br />
      That they, or he, these omens would avert,<br />
      Release our fears, and better signs impart.<br />
      Clear&rsquo;d, as I thought, and fully fix&rsquo;d at length<br />
      To learn the cause, I tugged with all my strength:<br />
      I bent my knees against the ground; once more<br />
      The violated myrtle ran with gore.<br />
      Scarce dare I tell the sequel: from the womb<br />
      Of wounded earth, and caverns of the tomb,<br />
      A groan, as of a troubled ghost, renew&rsquo;d<br />
      My fright, and then these dreadful words ensued:<br />
      &lsquo;Why dost thou thus my buried body rend?<br />
      O spare the corpse of thy unhappy friend!<br />
      Spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood:<br />
      The tears distil not from the wounded wood;<br />
      But ev&rsquo;ry drop this living tree contains<br />
      Is kindred blood, and ran in Trojan veins.<br />
      O fly from this unhospitable shore,<br />
      Warn&rsquo;d by my fate; for I am Polydore!<br />
      Here loads of lances, in my blood embrued,<br />
      Again shoot upward, by my blood renew&rsquo;d.&rsquo;<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;My falt&rsquo;ring tongue and shiv&rsquo;ring limbs declare<br />
      My horror, and in bristles rose my hair.<br />
      When Troy with Grecian arms was closely pent,<br />
      Old Priam, fearful of the war&rsquo;s event,<br />
      This hapless Polydore to Thracia sent:<br />
      Loaded with gold, he sent his darling, far<br />
      From noise and tumults, and destructive war,<br />
      Committed to the faithless tyrant&rsquo;s care;<br />
      Who, when he saw the pow&rsquo;r of Troy decline,<br />
      Forsook the weaker, with the strong to join;<br />
      Broke ev&rsquo;ry bond of nature and of truth,<br />
      And murder&rsquo;d, for his wealth, the royal youth.<br />
      O sacred hunger of pernicious gold!<br />
      What bands of faith can impious lucre hold?<br />
      Now, when my soul had shaken off her fears,<br />
      I call my father and the Trojan peers;<br />
      Relate the prodigies of Heav&rsquo;n, require<br />
      What he commands, and their advice desire.<br />
      All vote to leave that execrable shore,<br />
      Polluted with the blood of Polydore;<br />
      But, ere we sail, his fun&rsquo;ral rites prepare,<br />
      Then, to his ghost, a tomb and altars rear.<br />
      In mournful pomp the matrons walk the round,<br />
      With baleful cypress and blue fillets crown&rsquo;d,<br />
      With eyes dejected, and with hair unbound.<br />
      Then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour,<br />
      And thrice invoke the soul of Polydore.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;Now, when the raging storms no longer reign,<br />

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;An island in th&rsquo; Aegaean main appears;<br />

      Here, borne by friendly winds, we come ashore,<br />
      With needful ease our weary limbs restore,<br />
      And the Sun&rsquo;s temple and his town adore.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;Anius, the priest and king, with laurel crown&rsquo;d,<br />
      His hoary locks with purple fillets bound,<br />
      Who saw my sire the Delian shore ascend,<br />
      Came forth with eager haste to meet his friend;<br />
      Invites him to his palace; and, in sign<br />
      Of ancient love, their plighted hands they join.<br />
      Then to the temple of the god I went,<br />
      And thus, before the shrine, my vows present:<br />
      &lsquo;Give, O Thymbraeus, give a resting place<br />
      To the sad relics of the Trojan race;<br />
      A seat secure, a region of their own,<br />
      A lasting empire, and a happier town.<br />
      Where shall we fix? where shall our labours end?<br />
      Whom shall we follow, and what fate attend?<br />
      Let not my pray&rsquo;rs a doubtful answer find;<br />
      But in clear auguries unveil thy mind.&rsquo;<br />
      Scarce had I said: he shook the holy ground,<br />
      The laurels, and the lofty hills around;<br />
      And from the tripos rush&rsquo;d a bellowing sound.<br />
      Prostrate we fell; confess&rsquo;d the present god,<br />
      Who gave this answer from his dark abode:<br />
      &lsquo;Undaunted youths, go, seek that mother earth<br />
      From which your ancestors derive their birth.<br />
      The soil that sent you forth, her ancient race<br />
      In her old bosom shall again embrace.<br />
      Through the wide world th&rsquo; Aeneian house shall reign,<br />
      And children&rsquo;s children shall the crown sustain.&rsquo;<br />
      Thus Phoebus did our future fates disclose:<br />
      A mighty tumult, mix&rsquo;d with joy, arose.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;All are concern&rsquo;d to know what place the god<br />
      Assign&rsquo;d, and where determin&rsquo;d our abode.<br />

      The race and lineage of the Trojan kind,<br />
      Thus answer&rsquo;d their demands: &lsquo;Ye princes, hear<br />
      Your pleasing fortune, and dispel your fear.<br />
      The fruitful isle of Crete, well known to fame,<br />
      Sacred of old to Jove&rsquo;s imperial name,<br />
      In the mid ocean lies, with large command,<br />
      And on its plains a hundred cities stand.<br />
      Another Ida rises there, and we<br />
      From thence derive our Trojan ancestry.<br />
      From thence, as &rsquo;tis divulg&rsquo;d by certain fame,<br />
      To the Rhoetean shores old Teucrus came;<br />
      There fix&rsquo;d, and there the seat of empire chose,<br />
      Ere Ilium and the Trojan tow&rsquo;rs arose.<br />
      In humble vales they built their soft abodes,<br />
      Till Cybele, the mother of the gods,<br />
      With tinkling cymbals charm&rsquo;d th&rsquo; Idaean woods,<br />
      She secret rites and ceremonies taught,<br />
      And to the yoke the savage lions brought.<br />
      Let us the land which Heav&rsquo;n appoints, explore;<br />
      Appease the winds, and seek the Gnossian shore.<br />
      If Jove assists the passage of our fleet,<br />
      The third propitious dawn discovers Crete.&rsquo;<br />
      Thus having said, the sacrifices, laid<br />
      On smoking altars, to the gods he paid:<br />
      A bull, to Neptune an oblation due,<br />
      Another bull to bright Apollo slew;<br />
      A milk-white ewe, the western winds to please,<br />
      And one coal-black, to calm the stormy seas.<br />
      Ere this, a flying rumour had been spread<br />
      That fierce Idomeneus from Crete was fled,<br />
      Expell&rsquo;d and exil&rsquo;d; that the coast was free<br />
      From foreign or domestic enemy.<br />

      That, scarce distinguish&rsquo;d, seem to stud the seas.<br />
      The shouts of sailors double near the shores;<br />

      The soil is fruitful, and the natives bold.<br />
      Th&rsquo; Oenotrians held it once, by later fame<br />
      Now call&rsquo;d Italia, from the leader&rsquo;s name.<br />
      Jasius there and Dardanus were born;<br />

      I bid my friends for vengeance then prepare,<br />
      And with the hellish nation wage the war.<br />
      They, as commanded, for the fight provide,<br />
      And in the grass their glitt&rsquo;ring weapons hide;<br />
      Then, when along the crooked shore we hear<br />
      Their clatt&rsquo;ring wings, and saw the foes appear,<br />
      Misenus sounds a charge: we take th&rsquo; alarm,<br />
      And our strong hands with swords and bucklers arm.<br />
      In this new kind of combat all employ<br />
      Their utmost force, the monsters to destroy.<br />
      In vain, the fated skin is proof to wounds;<br />
      And from their plumes the shining sword rebounds.<br />
      At length rebuff&rsquo;d, they leave their mangled prey,<br />
      And their stretch&rsquo;d pinions to the skies display.<br />
      Yet one remain&rsquo;d, the messenger of Fate:<br />
      High on a craggy cliff Celaeno sate,<br />
      And thus her dismal errand did relate:<br />
      &lsquo;What! not contented with our oxen slain,<br />
      Dare you with Heav&rsquo;n an impious war maintain,<br />
      And drive the Harpies from their native reign?<br />
      Heed therefore what I say; and keep in mind<br />
      What Jove decrees, what Phoebus has design&rsquo;d,<br />
      And I, the Furies&rsquo; queen, from both relate:<br />
      You seek th&rsquo; Italian shores, foredoom&rsquo;d by fate:<br />
      Th&rsquo; Italian shores are granted you to find,<br />
      And a safe passage to the port assign&rsquo;d.<br />
      But know, that ere your promis&rsquo;d walls you build,<br />
      My curses shall severely be fulfill&rsquo;d.<br />
      Fierce famine is your lot for this misdeed,<br />
      Reduc&rsquo;d to grind the plates on which you feed.&rsquo;<br />
      She said, and to the neighb&rsquo;ring forest flew.<br />
      Our courage fails us, and our fears renew.<br />
      Hopeless to win by war, to pray&rsquo;rs we fall,<br />
      And on th&rsquo; offended Harpies humbly call,<br />
      And whether gods or birds obscene they were,<br />
      Our vows for pardon and for peace prefer.<br />
      But old Anchises, off&rsquo;ring sacrifice,<br />
      And lifting up to heav&rsquo;n his hands and eyes,<br />
      Ador&rsquo;d the greater gods: &lsquo;Avert,&rsquo; said he,<br />
      &lsquo;These omens; render vain this prophecy,<br />
      And from th&rsquo; impending curse a pious people free!&rsquo;<br />

      &ldquo;Thus having said, he bids us put to sea;<br />
      We loose from shore our haulsers, and obey,<br />

      Amidst our course, Zacynthian woods appear;<br />
      And next by rocky Neritos we steer:<br />
      We fly from Ithaca&rsquo;s detested shore,<br />
      And curse the land which dire Ulysses bore.<br />
      At length Leucate&rsquo;s cloudy top appears,<br />
      And the Sun&rsquo;s temple, which the sailor fears.<br />
      Resolv&rsquo;d to breathe a while from labour past,<br />
      Our crooked anchors from the prow we cast,<br />
      And joyful to the little city haste.<br />
      Here, safe beyond our hopes, our vows we pay<br />
      To Jove, the guide and patron of our way.<br />
      The customs of our country we pursue,<br />
      And Trojan games on Actian shores renew.<br />
      Our youth their naked limbs besmear with oil,<br />
      And exercise the wrastlers&rsquo; noble toil;<br />
      Pleas&rsquo;d to have sail&rsquo;d so long before the wind,<br />
      And left so many Grecian towns behind.<br />
      The sun had now fulfill&rsquo;d his annual course,<br />
      And Boreas on the seas display&rsquo;d his force:<br />
      I fix&rsquo;d upon the temple&rsquo;s lofty door<br />
      The brazen shield which vanquish&rsquo;d Abas bore;<br />
      The verse beneath my name and action speaks:<br />
      &lsquo;These arms Aeneas took from conqu&rsquo;ring Greeks.&rsquo;<br />
      Then I command to weigh; the seamen ply<br />
      Their sweeping oars; the smoking billows fly.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;Then to Chaonia&rsquo;s port our course we bend,<br />

      Here wondrous things were loudly blaz&rsquo;d fame:<br />
      How Helenus reviv&rsquo;d the Trojan name,<br />
      And reign&rsquo;d in Greece; that Priam&rsquo;s captive son<br />
      Succeeded Pyrrhus in his bed and throne;<br />
      And fair Andromache, restor&rsquo;d by fate,<br />
      Once more was happy in a Trojan mate.<br />
      I leave my galleys riding in the port,<br />
      And long to see the new Dardanian court.<br />
      By chance, the mournful queen, before the gate,<br />
      Then solemniz&rsquo;d her former husband&rsquo;s fate.<br />
      Green altars, rais&rsquo;d of turf, with gifts she crown&rsquo;d,<br />
      And sacred priests in order stand around,<br />
      And thrice the name of hapless Hector sound.<br />
      The grove itself resembles Ida&rsquo;s wood;<br />
      And Simois seem&rsquo;d the well-dissembled flood.<br />
      But when at nearer distance she beheld<br />
      My shining armour and my Trojan shield,<br />
      Astonish&rsquo;d at the sight, the vital heat<br />
      Forsakes her limbs; her veins no longer beat:<br />
      She faints, she falls, and scarce recov&rsquo;ring strength,<br />
      Thus, with a falt&rsquo;ring tongue, she speaks at length:<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Are you alive, O goddess-born?&rsquo; she said,<br />
      &lsquo;Or if a ghost, then where is Hector&rsquo;s shade?&rsquo;<br />

      With broken words I made this brief reply:<br />
      &lsquo;All of me that remains appears in sight;<br />
      I live, if living be to loathe the light.<br />
      No phantom; but I drag a wretched life,<br />
      My fate resembling that of Hector&rsquo;s wife.<br />
      What have you suffer&rsquo;d since you lost your lord?<br />
      By what strange blessing are you now restor&rsquo;d?<br />
      Still are you Hector&rsquo;s? or is Hector fled,<br />
      And his remembrance lost in Pyrrhus&rsquo; bed?&rsquo;<br />
      With eyes dejected, in a lowly tone,<br />
      After a modest pause she thus begun:<br />

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;&lsquo;O only happy maid of Priam&rsquo;s race,<br />

      Not forc&rsquo;d, like us, to hard captivity,<br />
      Or in a haughty master&rsquo;s arms to lie.<br />
      In Grecian ships unhappy we were borne,<br />
      Endur&rsquo;d the victor&rsquo;s lust, sustain&rsquo;d the scorn:<br />
      Thus I submitted to the lawless pride<br />
      Of Pyrrhus, more a handmaid than a bride.<br />
      Cloy&rsquo;d with possession, he forsook my bed,<br />
      And Helen&rsquo;s lovely daughter sought to wed;<br />
      Then me to Trojan Helenus resign&rsquo;d,<br />
      And his two slaves in equal marriage join&rsquo;d;<br />
      Till young Orestes, pierc&rsquo;d with deep despair,<br />
      And longing to redeem the promis&rsquo;d fair,<br />
      Before Apollo&rsquo;s altar slew the ravisher.<br />
      By Pyrrhus&rsquo; death the kingdom we regain&rsquo;d:<br />
      At least one half with Helenus remain&rsquo;d.<br />
      Our part, from Chaon, he Chaonia calls,<br />
      And names from Pergamus his rising walls.<br />
      But you, what fates have landed on our coast?<br />
      What gods have sent you, or what storms have toss&rsquo;d?<br />
      Does young Ascanius life and health enjoy,<br />
      Sav&rsquo;d from the ruins of unhappy Troy?<br />
      O tell me how his mother&rsquo;s loss he bears,<br />
      What hopes are promis&rsquo;d from his blooming years,<br />
      How much of Hector in his face appears?&rsquo;<br />
      She spoke; and mix&rsquo;d her speech with mournful cries,<br />

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;At length her lord descends upon the plain,<br />

      Proceeding on, another Troy I see,<br />
      Or, in less compass, Troy&rsquo;s epitome.<br />
      A riv&rsquo;let by the name of Xanthus ran,<br />
      And I embrace the Scaean gate again.<br />
      My friends in porticoes were entertain&rsquo;d,<br />
      And feasts and pleasures thro&rsquo; the city reign&rsquo;d.<br />
      The tables fill&rsquo;d the spacious hall around,<br />
      And golden bowls with sparkling wine were crown&rsquo;d.<br />
      Two days we pass&rsquo;d in mirth, till friendly gales,<br />
      Blown from the south supplied our swelling sails.<br />
      Then to the royal seer I thus began:<br />
      &lsquo;O thou, who know&rsquo;st, beyond the reach of man,<br />
      The laws of heav&rsquo;n, and what the stars decree;<br />
      Whom Phoebus taught unerring prophecy,<br />
      From his own tripod, and his holy tree;<br />
      Skill&rsquo;d in the wing&rsquo;d inhabitants of air,<br />
      What auspices their notes and flights declare:<br />
      O say; for all religious rites portend<br />
      A happy voyage, and a prosp&rsquo;rous end;<br />
      And ev&rsquo;ry power and omen of the sky<br />
      Direct my course for destin&rsquo;d Italy;<br />
      But only dire Celaeno, from the gods,<br />
      A dismal famine fatally forebodes:<br />
      O say what dangers I am first to shun,<br />
      What toils vanquish, and what course to run.&rsquo;<br />

      Full of religious doubts and awful dread.<br />
      Then, with his god possess&rsquo;d, before the shrine,<br />
      These words proceeded from his mouth divine:<br />
      &lsquo;O goddess-born, (for Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s appointed will,<br />
      With greater auspices of good than ill,<br />
      Foreshows thy voyage, and thy course directs;<br />
      Thy fates conspire, and Jove himself protects,)<br />
      Of many things some few I shall explain,<br />
      Teach thee to shun the dangers of the main,<br />
      And how at length the promis&rsquo;d shore to gain.<br />
      The rest the fates from Helenus conceal,<br />
      And Juno&rsquo;s angry pow&rsquo;r forbids to tell.<br />
      First, then, that happy shore, that seems so nigh,<br />
      Will far from your deluded wishes fly;<br />
      Long tracts of seas divide your hopes from Italy:<br />
      For you must cruise along Sicilian shores,<br />
      And stem the currents with your struggling oars;<br />
      Then round th&rsquo; Italian coast your navy steer;<br />
      And, after this, to Circe&rsquo;s island veer;<br />
      And, last, before your new foundations rise,<br />
      Must pass the Stygian lake, and view the nether skies.<br />
      Now mark the signs of future ease and rest,<br />
      And bear them safely treasur&rsquo;d in thy breast.<br />
      When, in the shady shelter of a wood,<br />
      And near the margin of a gentle flood,<br />
      Thou shalt behold a sow upon the ground,<br />
      With thirty sucking young encompass&rsquo;d round;<br />
      The dam and offspring white as falling snow:<br />
      These on thy city shall their name bestow,<br />
      And there shall end thy labours and thy woe.<br />
      Nor let the threaten&rsquo;d famine fright thy mind,<br />
      For Phoebus will assist, and Fate the way will find.<br />
      Let not thy course to that ill coast be bent,<br />
      Which fronts from far th&rsquo; Epirian continent:<br />
      Those parts are all by Grecian foes possess&rsquo;d;<br />
      The salvage Locrians here the shores infest;<br />
      There fierce Idomeneus his city builds,<br />
      And guards with arms the Salentinian fields;<br />
      And on the mountain&rsquo;s brow Petilia stands,<br />
      Which Philoctetes with his troops commands.<br />
      Ev&rsquo;n when thy fleet is landed on the shore,<br />
      And priests with holy vows the gods adore,<br />
      Then with a purple veil involve your eyes,<br />
      Lest hostile faces blast the sacrifice.<br />
      These rites and customs to the rest commend,<br />
      That to your pious race they may descend.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      &lsquo;When, parted hence, the wind, that ready waits<br />
      For Sicily, shall bear you to the straits<br />
      Where proud Pelorus opes a wider way,<br />
      Tack to the larboard, and stand off to sea:<br />
      Veer starboard sea and land. Th&rsquo; Italian shore<br />
      And fair Sicilia&rsquo;s coast were one, before<br />
      An earthquake caus&rsquo;d the flaw: the roaring tides<br />
      The passage broke that land from land divides;<br />
      And where the lands retir&rsquo;d, the rushing ocean rides.<br />
      Distinguish&rsquo;d by the straits, on either hand,<br />
      Now rising cities in long order stand,<br />
      And fruitful fields: so much can time invade<br />
      The mould&rsquo;ring work that beauteous Nature made.<br />
      Far on the right, her dogs foul Scylla hides:<br />
      Charybdis roaring on the left presides,<br />
      And in her greedy whirlpool sucks the tides;<br />
      Then spouts them from below: with fury driv&rsquo;n,<br />
      The waves mount up and wash the face of heav&rsquo;n.<br />
      But Scylla from her den, with open jaws,<br />
      The sinking vessel in her eddy draws,<br />
      Then dashes on the rocks. A human face,<br />
      And virgin bosom, hides her tail&rsquo;s disgrace:<br />
      Her parts obscene below the waves descend,<br />
      With dogs inclos&rsquo;d, and in a dolphin end.<br />
      &rsquo;Tis safer, then, to bear aloof to sea,<br />
      And coast Pachynus, tho&rsquo; with more delay,<br />
      Than once to view misshapen Scylla near,<br />
      And the loud yell of wat&rsquo;ry wolves to hear.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Besides, if faith to Helenus be due,<br />
      And if prophetic Phoebus tell me true,<br />
      Do not this precept of your friend forget,<br />
      Which therefore more than once I must repeat:<br />
      Above the rest, great Juno&rsquo;s name adore;<br />
      Pay vows to Juno; Juno&rsquo;s aid implore.<br />
      Let gifts be to the mighty queen design&rsquo;d,<br />
      And mollify with pray&rsquo;rs her haughty mind.<br />
      Thus, at the length, your passage shall be free,<br />
      And you shall safe descend on Italy.<br />
      Arriv&rsquo;d at Cumae, when you view the flood<br />
      Of black Avernus, and the sounding wood,<br />
      The mad prophetic Sibyl you shall find,<br />
      Dark in a cave, and on a rock reclin&rsquo;d.<br />
      She sings the fates, and, in her frantic fits,<br />
      The notes and names, inscrib&rsquo;d, to leafs commits.<br />
      What she commits to leafs, in order laid,<br />
      Before the cavern&rsquo;s entrance are display&rsquo;d:<br />
      Unmov&rsquo;d they lie; but, if a blast of wind<br />
      Without, or vapours issue from behind,<br />
      The leafs are borne aloft in liquid air,<br />
      And she resumes no more her museful care,<br />
      Nor gathers from the rocks her scatter&rsquo;d verse,<br />
      Nor sets in order what the winds disperse.<br />
      Thus, many not succeeding, most upbraid<br />
      The madness of the visionary maid,<br />
      And with loud curses leave the mystic shade.<br />

      With willing words, and not to write thy fate.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;And now the rising morn with rosy light<br />
      Adorns the skies, and puts the stars to flight;<br />
      When we from far, like bluish mists, descry<br />
      The hills, and then the plains, of Italy.<br />
      Achates first pronounc&rsquo;d the joyful sound;<br />
      Then, &lsquo;Italy!&rsquo; the cheerful crew rebound.<br />
      My sire Anchises crown&rsquo;d a cup with wine,<br />
      And, off&rsquo;ring, thus implor&rsquo;d the pow&rsquo;rs divine:<br />
      &lsquo;Ye gods, presiding over lands and seas,<br />
      And you who raging winds and waves appease,<br />
      Breathe on our swelling sails a prosp&rsquo;rous wind,<br />
      And smooth our passage to the port assign&rsquo;d!&rsquo;<br />
      The gentle gales their flagging force renew,<br />
      And now the happy harbour is in view.<br />
      Minerva&rsquo;s temple then salutes our sight,<br />
      Plac&rsquo;d, as a landmark, on the mountain&rsquo;s height.<br />
      We furl our sails, and turn the prows to shore;<br />
      The curling waters round the galleys roar.<br />
      The land lies open to the raging east,<br />
      Then, bending like a bow, with rocks compress&rsquo;d,<br />
      Shuts out the storms; the winds and waves complain,<br />
      And vent their malice on the cliffs in vain.<br />
      The port lies hid within; on either side<br />
      Two tow&rsquo;ring rocks the narrow mouth divide.<br />
      The temple, which aloft we view&rsquo;d before,<br />
      To distance flies, and seems to shun the shore.<br />
      Scarce landed, the first omens I beheld<br />
      Were four white steeds that cropp&rsquo;d the flow&rsquo;ry field.<br />
      &lsquo;War, war is threaten&rsquo;d from this foreign ground,&rsquo;<br />
      My father cried, &lsquo;where warlike steeds are found.<br />
      Yet, since reclaim&rsquo;d to chariots they submit,<br />
      And bend to stubborn yokes, and champ the bit,<br />
      Peace may succeed to war.&rsquo; Our way we bend<br />
      To Pallas, and the sacred hill ascend;<br />
      There prostrate to the fierce Virago pray,<br />
      Whose temple was the landmark of our way.<br />
      Each with a Phrygian mantle veil&rsquo;d his head,<br />
      And all commands of Helenus obey&rsquo;d,<br />
      And pious rites to Grecian Juno paid.<br />
      These dues perform&rsquo;d, we stretch our sails, and stand<br />
      To sea, forsaking that suspected land.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;From hence Tarentum&rsquo;s bay appears in view,<br />
      For Hercules renown&rsquo;d, if fame be true.<br />
      Just opposite, Lacinian Juno stands;<br />
      Caulonian tow&rsquo;rs, and Scylacaean strands,<br />
      For shipwrecks fear&rsquo;d. Mount Aetna thence we spy,<br />
      Known by the smoky flames which cloud the sky.<br />
      Far off we hear the waves with surly sound<br />
      Invade the rocks, the rocks their groans rebound.<br />
      The billows break upon the sounding strand,<br />
      And roll the rising tide, impure with sand.<br />
      Then thus Anchises, in experience old:<br />
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis that Charybdis which the seer foretold,<br />
      And those the promis&rsquo;d rocks! Bear off to sea!&rsquo;<br />
      With haste the frighted mariners obey.<br />
      First Palinurus to the larboard veer&rsquo;d;<br />
      Then all the fleet by his example steer&rsquo;d.<br />
      To heav&rsquo;n aloft on ridgy waves we ride,<br />
      Then down to hell descend, when they divide;<br />
      And thrice our galleys knock&rsquo;d the stony ground,<br />
      And thrice the hollow rocks return&rsquo;d the sound,<br />
      And thrice we saw the stars, that stood with dews around.<br />
      The flagging winds forsook us, with the sun;<br />
      And, wearied, on Cyclopian shores we run.<br />
      The port capacious, and secure from wind,<br />
      Is to the foot of thund&rsquo;ring Aetna join&rsquo;d.<br />
      By turns a pitchy cloud she rolls on high;<br />
      By turns hot embers from her entrails fly,<br />
      And flakes of mounting flames, that lick the sky.<br />
      Oft from her bowels massy rocks are thrown,<br />
      And, shiver&rsquo;d by the force, come piecemeal down.<br />
      Oft liquid lakes of burning sulphur flow,<br />
      Fed from the fiery springs that boil below.<br />
      Enceladus, they say, transfix&rsquo;d by Jove,<br />
      With blasted limbs came tumbling from above;<br />
      And, where he fell, th&rsquo; avenging father drew<br />
      This flaming hill, and on his body threw.<br />
      As often as he turns his weary sides,<br />
      He shakes the solid isle, and smoke the heavens hides.<br />
      In shady woods we pass the tedious night,<br />
      Where bellowing sounds and groans our souls affright,<br />
      Of which no cause is offer&rsquo;d to the sight;<br />
      For not one star was kindled in the sky,<br />
      Nor could the moon her borrow&rsquo;d light supply;<br />
      For misty clouds involv&rsquo;d the firmament,<br />
      The stars were muffled, and the moon was pent.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;Scarce had the rising sun the day reveal&rsquo;d,<br />
      Scarce had his heat the pearly dews dispell&rsquo;d,<br />
      When from the woods there bolts, before our sight,<br />
      Somewhat betwixt a mortal and a sprite,<br />
      So thin, so ghastly meager, and so wan,<br />
      So bare of flesh, he scarce resembled man.<br />
      This thing, all tatter&rsquo;d, seem&rsquo;d from far t&rsquo;implore<br />
      Our pious aid, and pointed to the shore.<br />
      We look behind, then view his shaggy beard;<br />
      His clothes were tagg&rsquo;d with thorns, and filth his limbs besmear&rsquo;d;<br />
      The rest, in mien, in habit, and in face,<br />

      He cast on us, from far, a frightful view,<br />
      Whom soon for Trojans and for foes he knew;<br />
      Stood still, and paus&rsquo;d; then all at once began<br />
      To stretch his limbs, and trembled as he ran.<br />
      Soon as approach&rsquo;d, upon his knees he falls,<br />
      And thus with tears and sighs for pity calls:<br />
      &lsquo;Now, by the pow&rsquo;rs above, and what we share<br />
      From Nature&rsquo;s common gift, this vital air,<br />
      O Trojans, take me hence! I beg no more;<br />
      But bear me far from this unhappy shore.<br />
      &rsquo;Tis true, I am a Greek, and farther own,<br />
      Among your foes besieg&rsquo;d th&rsquo; imperial town.<br />
      For such demerits if my death be due,<br />
      No more for this abandon&rsquo;d life I sue;<br />
      This only favour let my tears obtain,<br />
      To throw me headlong in the rapid main:<br />
      Since nothing more than death my crime demands,<br />
      I die content, to die by human hands.&rsquo;<br />
      He said, and on his knees my knees embrac&rsquo;d:<br />
      I bade him boldly tell his fortune past,<br />
      His present state, his lineage, and his name,<br />
      Th&rsquo; occasion of his fears, and whence he came.<br />
      The good Anchises rais&rsquo;d him with his hand;<br />
      Who, thus encourag&rsquo;d, answer&rsquo;d our demand:<br />
      &lsquo;From Ithaca, my native soil, I came<br />
      To Troy; and Achaemenides my name.<br />
      Me my poor father with Ulysses sent;<br />
      (O had I stay&rsquo;d, with poverty content!)<br />
      But, fearful for themselves, my countrymen<br />
      Left me forsaken in the Cyclops&rsquo; den.<br />
      The cave, tho&rsquo; large, was dark; the dismal floor<br />
      Was pav&rsquo;d with mangled limbs and putrid gore.<br />
      Our monstrous host, of more than human size,<br />
      Erects his head, and stares within the skies;<br />
      Bellowing his voice, and horrid is his hue.<br />
      Ye gods, remove this plague from mortal view!<br />
      The joints of slaughter&rsquo;d wretches are his food;<br />
      And for his wine he quaffs the streaming blood.<br />
      These eyes beheld, when with his spacious hand<br />
      He seiz&rsquo;d two captives of our Grecian band;<br />
      Stretch&rsquo;d on his back, he dash&rsquo;d against the stones<br />
      Their broken bodies, and their crackling bones:<br />
      With spouting blood the purple pavement swims,<br />
      While the dire glutton grinds the trembling limbs.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Not unreveng&rsquo;d Ulysses bore their fate,<br />

      While fast asleep the giant lay supine,<br />
      Snoring aloud, and belching from his maw<br />
      His indigested foam, and morsels raw;<br />
      We pray; we cast the lots, and then surround<br />
      The monstrous body, stretch&rsquo;d along the ground:<br />
      Each, as he could approach him, lends a hand<br />
      To bore his eyeball with a flaming brand.<br />
      Beneath his frowning forehead lay his eye;<br />
      For only one did the vast frame supply;<br />
      But that a globe so large, his front it fill&rsquo;d,<br />
      Like the sun&rsquo;s disk or like a Grecian shield.<br />
      The stroke succeeds; and down the pupil bends:<br />
      This vengeance follow&rsquo;d for our slaughter&rsquo;d friends.<br />
      But haste, unhappy wretches, haste to fly!<br />
      Your cables cut, and on your oars rely!<br />
      Such, and so vast as Polypheme appears,<br />
      A hundred more this hated island bears:<br />
      Like him, in caves they shut their woolly sheep;<br />
      Like him, their herds on tops of mountains keep;<br />
      Like him, with mighty strides, they stalk from steep to steep<br />
      And now three moons their sharpen&rsquo;d horns renew,<br />
      Since thus, in woods and wilds, obscure from view,<br />
      I drag my loathsome days with mortal fright,<br />
      And in deserted caverns lodge by night;<br />
      Oft from the rocks a dreadful prospect see<br />
      Of the huge Cyclops, like a walking tree:<br />
      From far I hear his thund&rsquo;ring voice resound,<br />
      And trampling feet that shake the solid ground.<br />
      Cornels and salvage berries of the wood,<br />
      And roots and herbs, have been my meager food.<br />
      While all around my longing eyes I cast,<br />
      I saw your happy ships appear at last.<br />
      On those I fix&rsquo;d my hopes, to these I run;<br />
      &rsquo;Tis all I ask, this cruel race to shun;<br />
      What other death you please, yourselves bestow.&rsquo;<br />

      &ldquo;Scarce had he said, when on the mountain&rsquo;s brow<br />

      His following flock, and leading to the shore:<br />

      His staff a trunk of pine, to guide his steps aright.<br />
      His pond&rsquo;rous whistle from his neck descends;<br />
      His woolly care their pensive lord attends:<br />
      This only solace his hard fortune sends.<br />
      Soon as he reach&rsquo;d the shore and touch&rsquo;d the waves,<br />

      He gnash&rsquo;d his teeth, and groan&rsquo;d; thro&rsquo; seas he strides,<br />

      He strided onward, and in vain essay&rsquo;d<br />

      Before the bellowing noise to distant Italy.<br />
      The neighb&rsquo;ring Aetna trembling all around,<br />

      Not yielding to the tow&rsquo;ring tree of Jove,<br />

      Forewarn&rsquo;d by Helenus, we strive to shun<br />
      Charybdis&rsquo; gulf, nor dare to Scylla run.<br />
      An equal fate on either side appears:<br />
      We, tacking to the left, are free from fears;<br />

    <h5> THE ARGUMENT. </h5>
   
    <p>
      Dido discovers to her sister her passion for Aeneas, and her thoughts of 
      marrying him. She prepares a hunting match for his entertainment. Juno, by
      Venus&rsquo; consent, raises a storm, which separates the hunters, and drives
      Aeneas and Dido into the same cave, where their marriage is supposed to be 
      completed. Jupiter despatches Mercury to Aeneas, to warn him from Carthage.
      Aeneas secretly prepares for his voyage. Dido finds out his design, and, to
      put a stop to it, makes use of her own and her sister&rsquo;s entreaties, and
      discovers all the variety of passions that are incident to a neglected lover.
      When nothing could prevail upon him, she contrives her own death, with which
      this book concludes.

      Sticks in her side, and rankles in her heart.<br />
      And now she leads the Trojan chief along<br />
      The lofty walls, amidst the busy throng;<br />
      Displays her Tyrian wealth, and rising town,<br />
      Which love, without his labour, makes his own.<br />
      This pomp she shows, to tempt her wand&rsquo;ring guest;<br />
      Her falt&rsquo;ring tongue forbids to speak the rest.<br />
      When day declines, and feasts renew the night,<br />
      Still on his face she feeds her famish&rsquo;d sight;<br />
      She longs again to hear the prince relate<br />
      His own adventures and the Trojan fate.<br />

      One common kingdom, one united line.<br />

      Which would the scepter of the world misguide<br />
      To Libyan shores, thus artfully replied:<br />
      &ldquo;Who, but a fool, would wars with Juno choose,<br />

      If Fortune with our joint desires comply?<br />
      The doubt is all from Jove and destiny;<br />
      Lest he forbid, with absolute command,<br />
      To mix the people in one common land.<br />
      Or will the Trojan and the Tyrian line<br />
      In lasting leagues and sure succession join?<br />
      But you, the partner of his bed and throne,<br />
      May move his mind; my wishes are your own.&rdquo;<br />

      And at her back a golden quiver bore;<br />
      Her flowing hair a golden caul restrains,<br />
      A golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains.<br />
      Then young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace,<br />
      Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase.<br />

      When to his native Delos he resorts,<br />
      Ordains the dances, and renews the sports;<br />
      Where painted Scythians, mix&rsquo;d with Cretan bands,<br />
      Before the joyful altars join their hands:<br />

      The merry madness of the sacred show.<br />
      Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose;<br />
      A golden fillet binds his awful brows;<br />

      Now had they reach&rsquo;d the hills, and storm&rsquo;d the seat<br />

      Whom have I now to trust, ungrateful guest?<br />
      (That only name remains of all the rest!)<br />
      What have I left? or whither can I fly?<br />
      Must I attend Pygmalion&rsquo;s cruelty,<br />
      Or till Hyarba shall in triumph lead<br />
      A queen that proudly scorn&rsquo;d his proffer&rsquo;d bed?<br />
      Had you deferr&rsquo;d, at least, your hasty flight,<br />
      And left behind some pledge of our delight,<br />
      Some babe to bless the mother&rsquo;s mournful sight,<br />
      Some young Aeneas, to supply your place,<br />
      Whose features might express his father&rsquo;s face;<br />
      I should not then complain to live bereft<br />
      Of all my husband, or be wholly left.&rdquo;<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Here paus&rsquo;d the queen. Unmov&rsquo;d he holds his eyes,<br />
      By Jove&rsquo;s command; nor suffer&rsquo;d love to rise,<br />
      Tho&rsquo; heaving in his heart; and thus at length replies:<br />
      &ldquo;Fair queen, you never can enough repeat<br />
      Your boundless favours, or I own my debt;<br />
      Nor can my mind forget Eliza&rsquo;s name,<br />
      While vital breath inspires this mortal frame.<br />
      This only let me speak in my defence:<br />
      I never hop&rsquo;d a secret flight from hence,<br />
      Much less pretended to the lawful claim<br />
      Of sacred nuptials, or a husband&rsquo;s name.<br />
      For, if indulgent Heav&rsquo;n would leave me free,<br />
      And not submit my life to fate&rsquo;s decree,<br />
      My choice would lead me to the Trojan shore,<br />
      Those relics to review, their dust adore,<br />
      And Priam&rsquo;s ruin&rsquo;d palace to restore.<br />
      But now the Delphian oracle commands,<br />
      And fate invites me to the Latian lands.<br />
      That is the promis&rsquo;d place to which I steer,<br />
      And all my vows are terminated there.<br />
      If you, a Tyrian, and a stranger born,<br />
      With walls and tow&rsquo;rs a Libyan town adorn,<br />
      Why may not we, like you, a foreign race,<br />
      Like you, seek shelter in a foreign place?<br />
      As often as the night obscures the skies<br />
      With humid shades, or twinkling stars arise,<br />
      Anchises&rsquo; angry ghost in dreams appears,<br />
      Chides my delay, and fills my soul with fears;<br />
      And young Ascanius justly may complain<br />
      Of his defrauded and destin&rsquo;d reign.<br />
      Ev&rsquo;n now the herald of the gods appear&rsquo;d:<br />
      Waking I saw him, and his message heard.<br />
      From Jove he came commission&rsquo;d, heav&rsquo;nly bright<br />
      With radiant beams, and manifest to sight<br />
      (The sender and the sent I both attest)<br />
      These walls he enter&rsquo;d, and those words express&rsquo;d.<br />
      Fair queen, oppose not what the gods command;<br />
      Forc&rsquo;d by my fate, I leave your happy land.&rdquo;<br />

      Thus while he spoke, already she began,<br />

      &ldquo;False as thou art, and, more than false, forsworn!<br />
      Not sprung from noble blood, nor goddess-born,<br />
      But hewn from harden&rsquo;d entrails of a rock!<br />
      And rough Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck!<br />
      Why should I fawn? what have I worse to fear?<br />
      Did he once look, or lent a list&rsquo;ning ear,<br />
      Sigh&rsquo;d when I sobb&rsquo;d, or shed one kindly tear?<br />
      All symptoms of a base ungrateful mind,<br />
      So foul, that, which is worse, &rsquo;tis hard to find.<br />
      Of man&rsquo;s injustice why should I complain?<br />
      The gods, and Jove himself, behold in vain<br />
      Triumphant treason; yet no thunder flies,<br />
      Nor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes;<br />
      Faithless is earth, and faithless are the skies!<br />
      Justice is fled, and Truth is now no more!<br />
      I sav&rsquo;d the shipwreck&rsquo;d exile on my shore;<br />
      With needful food his hungry Trojans fed;<br />
      I took the traitor to my throne and bed:<br />
      Fool that I was&mdash;&mdash; &rsquo;tis little to repeat<br />
      The rest, I stor&rsquo;d and rigg&rsquo;d his ruin&rsquo;d fleet.<br />
      I rave, I rave! A god&rsquo;s command he pleads,<br />
      And makes Heav&rsquo;n accessary to his deeds.<br />
      Now Lycian lots, and now the Delian god,<br />
      Now Hermes is employ&rsquo;d from Jove&rsquo;s abode,<br />
      To warn him hence; as if the peaceful state<br />
      Of heav&rsquo;nly pow&rsquo;rs were touch&rsquo;d with human fate!<br />
      But go! thy flight no longer I detain;<br />
      Go seek thy promis&rsquo;d kingdom thro&rsquo; the main!<br />
      Yet, if the heav&rsquo;ns will hear my pious vow,<br />
      The faithless waves, not half so false as thou,<br />
      Or secret sands, shall sepulchers afford<br />
      To thy proud vessels, and their perjur&rsquo;d lord.<br />
      Then shalt thou call on injur&rsquo;d Dido&rsquo;s name:<br />
      Dido shall come in a black sulph&rsquo;ry flame,<br />
      When death has once dissolv&rsquo;d her mortal frame;<br />
      Shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep:<br />
      Her angry ghost, arising from the deep,<br />
      Shall haunt thee waking, and disturb thy sleep.<br />
      At least my shade thy punishment shall know,<br />
      And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below.&rdquo;<br />

      In human hearts, subjected to thy laws!<br />

      The wretched queen, pursued by cruel fate,<br />
      Begins at length the light of heav&rsquo;n to hate,<br />
      And loathes to live. Then dire portents she sees,<br />
      To hasten on the death her soul decrees:<br />
      Strange to relate! for when, before the shrine,<br />
      She pours in sacrifice the purple wine,<br />
      The purple wine is turn&rsquo;d to putrid blood,<br />
      And the white offer&rsquo;d milk converts to mud.<br />
      This dire presage, to her alone reveal&rsquo;d,<br />
      From all, and ev&rsquo;n her sister, she conceal&rsquo;d.<br />
      A marble temple stood within the grove,<br />
      Sacred to death, and to her murder&rsquo;d love;<br />
      That honour&rsquo;d chapel she had hung around<br />
      With snowy fleeces, and with garlands crown&rsquo;d:<br />
      Oft, when she visited this lonely dome,<br />
      Strange voices issued from her husband&rsquo;s tomb;<br />
      She thought she heard him summon her away,<br />
      Invite her to his grave, and chide her stay.<br />
      Hourly &rsquo;tis heard, when with a boding note<br />
      The solitary screech owl strains her throat,<br />
      And, on a chimney&rsquo;s top, or turret&rsquo;s height,<br />
      With songs obscene disturbs the silence of the night.<br />
      Besides, old prophecies augment her fears;<br />
      And stern Aeneas in her dreams appears,<br />
      Disdainful as by day: she seems, alone,<br />
      To wander in her sleep, thro&rsquo; ways unknown,<br />
      Guideless and dark; or, in a desert plain,<br />
      To seek her subjects, and to seek in vain:<br />
      Like Pentheus, when, distracted with his fear,<br />
      He saw two suns, and double Thebes, appear;<br />
      Or mad Orestes, when his mother&rsquo;s ghost<br />
      Full in his face infernal torches toss&rsquo;d,<br />
      And shook her snaky locks: he shuns the sight,<br />
      Flies o&rsquo;er the stage, surpris&rsquo;d with mortal fright;<br />
      The Furies guard the door and intercept his flight.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Now, sinking underneath a load of grief,<br />
      From death alone she seeks her last relief;<br />
      The time and means resolv&rsquo;d within her breast,<br />

      (Dissembling hope, her cloudy front she clears,<br />
      And a false vigour in her eyes appears):<br />
      &ldquo;Rejoice!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Instructed from above,<br />
      My lover I shall gain, or lose my love.<br />
      Nigh rising Atlas, next the falling sun,<br />
      Long tracts of Ethiopian climates run:<br />
      There a Massylian priestess I have found,<br />
      Honour&rsquo;d for age, for magic arts renown&rsquo;d:<br />
      Th&rsquo; Hesperian temple was her trusted care;<br />
      &rsquo;Twas she supplied the wakeful dragon&rsquo;s fare.<br />
      She poppy seeds in honey taught to steep,<br />
      Reclaim&rsquo;d his rage, and sooth&rsquo;d him into sleep.<br />
      She watch&rsquo;d the golden fruit; her charms unbind<br />
      The chains of love, or fix them on the mind:<br />
      She stops the torrents, leaves the channel dry,<br />
      Repels the stars, and backward bears the sky.<br />
      The yawning earth rebellows to her call,<br />
      Pale ghosts ascend, and mountain ashes fall.<br />
      Witness, ye gods, and thou my better part,<br />
      How loth I am to try this impious art!<br />
      Within the secret court, with silent care,<br />
      Erect a lofty pile, expos&rsquo;d in air:<br />
      Hang on the topmost part the Trojan vest,<br />
      Spoils, arms, and presents, of my faithless guest.<br />
      Next, under these, the bridal bed be plac&rsquo;d,<br />
      Where I my ruin in his arms embrac&rsquo;d:<br />
      All relics of the wretch are doom&rsquo;d to fire;<br />
      For so the priestess and her charms require.&rdquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Thus far she said, and farther speech forbears;<br />

      Nor thought so dire a rage possess&rsquo;d her mind.<br />
      Unknowing of a train conceal&rsquo;d so well,<br />
      She fear&rsquo;d no worse than when Sichaeus fell;<br />
      Therefore obeys. The fatal pile they rear,<br />
      Within the secret court, expos&rsquo;d in air.<br />
      The cloven holms and pines are heap&rsquo;d on high,<br />

      And ev&rsquo;ry baleful green denoting death.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      And now (the sacred altars plac&rsquo;d around)<br />

      Night, Erebus, and Chaos she proclaims,<br />
      And threefold Hecate, with her hundred names,<br />

      Culls hoary simples, found by Phoebe&rsquo;s light,<br />
      With brazen sickles reap&rsquo;d at noon of night;<br />

      Himself I refug&rsquo;d, and his train reliev&rsquo;d;<br />
      &rsquo;Tis true; but am I sure to be receiv&rsquo;d?<br />
      Can gratitude in Trojan souls have place!<br />
      Laomedon still lives in all his race!<br />
      Then, shall I seek alone the churlish crew,<br />
      Or with my fleet their flying sails pursue?<br />
      What force have I but those whom scarce before<br />
      I drew reluctant from their native shore?<br />
      Will they again embark at my desire,<br />
      Once more sustain the seas, and quit their second Tyre?<br />
      Rather with steel thy guilty breast invade,<br />
      And take the fortune thou thyself hast made.<br />
      Your pity, sister, first seduc&rsquo;d my mind,<br />
      Or seconded too well what I design&rsquo;d.<br />
      These dear-bought pleasures had I never known,<br />
      Had I continued free, and still my own;<br />
      Avoiding love, I had not found despair,<br />
      But shar&rsquo;d with salvage beasts the common air.<br />
      Like them, a lonely life I might have led,<br />
      Not mourn&rsquo;d the living, nor disturb&rsquo;d the dead.&rdquo;<br />
      These thoughts she brooded in her anxious breast.<br />
      On board, the Trojan found more easy rest.<br />
      Resolv&rsquo;d to sail, in sleep he pass&rsquo;d the night;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      To whom once more the winged god appears;<br />

      The sea with ships will soon be cover&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er,<br />

      With headlong haste they leave the desert shores,<br />
      And brush the liquid seas with lab&rsquo;ring oars.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Aurora now had left her saffron bed,<br />
      And beams of early light the heav&rsquo;ns o&rsquo;erspread,<br />
      When, from a tow&rsquo;r, the queen, with wakeful eyes,<br />
      Saw day point upward from the rosy skies.<br />
      She look&rsquo;d to seaward; but the sea was void,<br />
      And scarce in ken the sailing ships descried.<br />
      Stung with despite, and furious with despair,<br />
      She struck her trembling breast, and tore her hair.<br />
      &ldquo;And shall th&rsquo; ungrateful traitor go,&rdquo; she said,<br />
      &ldquo;My land forsaken, and my love betray&rsquo;d?<br />
      Shall we not arm? not rush from ev&rsquo;ry street,<br />
      To follow, sink, and burn his perjur&rsquo;d fleet?<br />
      Haste, haul my galleys out! pursue the foe!<br />
      Bring flaming brands! set sail, and swiftly row!<br />
      What have I said? where am I? Fury turns<br />
      My brain; and my distemper&rsquo;d bosom burns.<br />
      Then, when I gave my person and my throne,<br />
      This hate, this rage, had been more timely shown.<br />
      See now the promis&rsquo;d faith, the vaunted name,<br />
      The pious man, who, rushing thro&rsquo; the flame,<br />
      Preserv&rsquo;d his gods, and to the Phrygian shore<br />
      The burthen of his feeble father bore!<br />
      I should have torn him piecemeal; strow&rsquo;d in floods<br />
      His scatter&rsquo;d limbs, or left expos&rsquo;d in woods;<br />
      Destroy&rsquo;d his friends and son; and, from the fire,<br />
      Have set the reeking boy before the sire.<br />
      Events are doubtful, which on battles wait:<br />
      Yet where&rsquo;s the doubt, to souls secure of fate?<br />
      My Tyrians, at their injur&rsquo;d queen&rsquo;s command,<br />
      Had toss&rsquo;d their fires amid the Trojan band;<br />
      At once extinguish&rsquo;d all the faithless name;<br />
      And I myself, in vengeance of my shame,<br />
      Had fall&rsquo;n upon the pile, to mend the fun&rsquo;ral flame.<br />
      Thou Sun, who view&rsquo;st at once the world below;<br />
      Thou Juno, guardian of the nuptial vow;<br />
      Thou Hecate hearken from thy dark abodes!<br />
      Ye Furies, fiends, and violated gods,<br />
      All pow&rsquo;rs invok&rsquo;d with Dido&rsquo;s dying breath,<br />
      Attend her curses and avenge her death!<br />
      If so the Fates ordain, Jove commands,<br />
      Th&rsquo; ungrateful wretch should find the Latian lands,<br />
      Yet let a race untam&rsquo;d, and haughty foes,<br />
      His peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose:<br />
      Oppress&rsquo;d with numbers in th&rsquo; unequal field,<br />
      His men discourag&rsquo;d, and himself expell&rsquo;d,<br />
      Let him for succour sue from place to place,<br />
      Torn from his subjects, and his son&rsquo;s embrace.<br />
      First, let him see his friends in battle slain,<br />
      And their untimely fate lament in vain;<br />
      And when, at length, the cruel war shall cease,<br />
      On hard conditions may he buy his peace:<br />
      Nor let him then enjoy supreme command;<br />
      But fall, untimely, by some hostile hand,<br />
      And lie unburied on the barren sand!<br />
      These are my pray&rsquo;rs, and this my dying will;<br />
      And you, my Tyrians, ev&rsquo;ry curse fulfil.<br />
      Perpetual hate and mortal wars proclaim,<br />
      Against the prince, the people, and the name.<br />
      These grateful off&rsquo;rings on my grave bestow;<br />
      Nor league, nor love, the hostile nations know!<br />
      Now, and from hence, in ev&rsquo;ry future age,<br />
      When rage excites your arms, and strength supplies the rage<br />
      Rise some avenger of our Libyan blood,<br />
      With fire and sword pursue the perjur&rsquo;d brood;<br />
      Our arms, our seas, our shores, oppos&rsquo;d to theirs;<br />
      And the same hate descend on all our heirs!&rdquo;<br />

      This said, within her anxious mind she weighs<br />
      The means of cutting short her odious days.<br />

      &ldquo;Go, Barce, call my sister. Let her care<br />

      With sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow.<br />
      Thus will I pay my vows to Stygian Jove,<br />
      And end the cares of my disastrous love;<br />

      With livid spots distinguish&rsquo;d was her face;<br />
      Red were her rolling eyes, and discompos&rsquo;d her pace;<br />
      Ghastly she gaz&rsquo;d, with pain she drew her breath,<br />
      And nature shiver&rsquo;d at approaching death.<br />

      (Not for so dire an enterprise design&rsquo;d).<br />
      But when she view&rsquo;d the garments loosely spread,<br />
      Which once he wore, and saw the conscious bed,<br />
      She paus&rsquo;d, and with a sigh the robes embrac&rsquo;d;<br />
      Then on the couch her trembling body cast,<br />
      Repress&rsquo;d the ready tears, and spoke her last:<br />
      &ldquo;Dear pledges of my love, while Heav&rsquo;n so pleas&rsquo;d,<br />
      Receive a soul, of mortal anguish eas&rsquo;d:<br />
      My fatal course is finish&rsquo;d; and I go,<br />
      A glorious name, among the ghosts below.<br />
      A lofty city by my hands is rais&rsquo;d,<br />
      Pygmalion punish&rsquo;d, and my lord appeas&rsquo;d.<br />
      What could my fortune have afforded more,<br />
      Had the false Trojan never touch&rsquo;d my shore!&rdquo;<br />
      Then kiss&rsquo;d the couch; and, &ldquo;Must I die,&rdquo; she said,<br />
      &ldquo;And unreveng&rsquo;d? &rsquo;Tis doubly to be dead!<br />
      Yet ev&rsquo;n this death with pleasure I receive:<br />
      On any terms, &rsquo;tis better than to live.<br />
      These flames, from far, may the false Trojan view;<br />
      These boding omens his base flight pursue!&rdquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      She said, and struck; deep enter&rsquo;d in her side<br />
      The piercing steel, with reeking purple dyed:<br />

      The spouting blood came streaming on her hands.<br />
      Her sad attendants saw the deadly stroke,<br />
      And with loud cries the sounding palace shook.<br />
      Distracted, from the fatal sight they fled,<br />
      And thro&rsquo; the town the dismal rumour spread.<br />
      First from the frighted court the yell began;<br />
      Redoubled, thence from house to house it ran:<br />
      The groans of men, with shrieks, laments, and cries<br />
      Of mixing women, mount the vaulted skies.<br />
      Not less the clamour, than if ancient Tyre,<br />
      Or the new Carthage, set by foes on fire,<br />
      The rolling ruin, with their lov&rsquo;d abodes,<br />

      Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping head,<br />
      And, fainting thrice, fell grov&rsquo;ling on the bed;<br />
      Thrice op&rsquo;d her heavy eyes, and sought the light,<br />

      Then Juno, grieving that she should sustain<br />

      For since she died, not doom&rsquo;d by Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s decree,<br />
      Or her own crime, but human casualty,<br />
      And rage of love, that plung&rsquo;d her in despair,<br />
      The Sisters had not cut the topmost hair,<br />
      Which Proserpine and they can only know;<br />
      Nor made her sacred to the shades below.<br />
      Downward the various goddess took her flight,<br />
      And drew a thousand colours from the light;<br />
      Then stood above the dying lover&rsquo;s head,<br />
      And said: &ldquo;I thus devote thee to the dead.<br />
      This off&rsquo;ring to th&rsquo; infernal gods I bear.&rdquo;<br />

    <h3><b> BOOK V </b></h3>
    
    <h5> THE ARGUMENT. </h5>
    
    <p>
      Aeneas, setting sail from Afric, is driven by a storm on the coast of Sicily,
      where he is hospitably received by his friend Acestes, king of part of the 
      island, and born of Trojan parentage. He applies himself to celebrate the 
      memory of his father with divine honours, and accordingly institues funeral
      games, and appoints prizes for those who should conquer in them. While the
      ceremonies are performing, Juno sends Iris to persuade the Trojan woman to
      burn the ships, who, upon her instigation, set fire to them: which burned
      four, and would have consumed the rest, had not Jupiter, by a miraculous
      shower extinguished it. Upon this, Aeneas, by the advice of one of his generals,
      and a vision of his father, builds a city for the women, old men, and others,
      who were either unfit for war, or weary of the voyage, and sails for Italy.
      Venus procures of Neptune a safe voyage for him and all his men, excepting
      only his pilot Palinurus, who was unfortunately lost.
      <br /><br />

      <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>eantime the Trojan cuts his wat&rsquo;ry way,<br />
      Fix&rsquo;d on his voyage, thro&rsquo; the curling sea;<br />
      Then, casting back his eyes, with dire amaze,<br />
      Sees on the Punic shore the mounting blaze.<br />
      The cause unknown; yet his presaging mind<br />
      The fate of Dido from the fire divin&rsquo;d;<br />
      He knew the stormy souls of womankind,<br />
      What secret springs their eager passions move,<br />
      How capable of death for injur&rsquo;d love.<br />
      Dire auguries from hence the Trojans draw;<br />
      Till neither fires nor shining shores they saw.<br />
      Now seas and skies their prospect only bound;<br />
      An empty space above, a floating field around.<br />
      But soon the heav&rsquo;ns with shadows were o&rsquo;erspread;<br />
      A swelling cloud hung hov&rsquo;ring o&rsquo;er their head:<br />
      Livid it look&rsquo;d, the threat&rsquo;ning of a storm:<br />
      Then night and horror ocean&rsquo;s face deform.<br />
      The pilot, Palinurus, cried aloud:<br />
      &ldquo;What gusts of weather from that gath&rsquo;ring cloud<br />
      My thoughts presage! Ere yet the tempest roars,<br />
      Stand to your tackle, mates, and stretch your oars;<br />
      Contract your swelling sails, and luff to wind.&rdquo;<br />
      The frighted crew perform the task assign&rsquo;d.<br />
      Then, to his fearless chief: &ldquo;Not Heav&rsquo;n,&rdquo; said he,<br />
      &ldquo;Tho&rsquo; Jove himself should promise Italy,<br />
      Can stem the torrent of this raging sea.<br />
      Mark how the shifting winds from west arise,<br />
      And what collected night involves the skies!<br />
      Nor can our shaken vessels live at sea,<br />
      Much less against the tempest force their way.<br />
      &rsquo;Tis fate diverts our course, and fate we must obey.<br />
      Not far from hence, if I observ&rsquo;d aright<br />
      The southing of the stars, and polar light,<br />
      Sicilia lies, whose hospitable shores<br />
      In safety we may reach with struggling oars.&rdquo;<br />
      Aeneas then replied: &ldquo;Too sure I find<br />
      We strive in vain against the seas and wind:<br />
      Now shift your sails; what place can please me more<br />
      Than what you promise, the Sicilian shore,<br />
      Whose hallow&rsquo;d earth Anchises&rsquo; bones contains,<br />
      And where a prince of Trojan lineage reigns?&rdquo;<br />
      The course resolv&rsquo;d, before the western wind<br />
      They scud amain, and make the port assign&rsquo;d.<br />
      Meantime Acestes, from a lofty stand,<br />
      Beheld the fleet descending on the land;<br />
      And, not unmindful of his ancient race,<br />
      Down from the cliff he ran with eager pace,<br />
      And held the hero in a strict embrace.<br />
      Of a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore,<br />
      And either hand a pointed jav&rsquo;lin bore.<br />
      His mother was a dame of Dardan blood;<br />
      His sire Crinisus, a Sicilian flood.<br />
      He welcomes his returning friends ashore<br />
      With plenteous country cates and homely store.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Now, when the following morn had chas&rsquo;d away<br />
      The flying stars, and light restor&rsquo;d the day,<br />
      Aeneas call&rsquo;d the Trojan troops around,<br />
      And thus bespoke them from a rising ground:<br />
      &ldquo;Offspring of heav&rsquo;n, divine Dardanian race!<br />

      The shining circle of the year has fill&rsquo;d,<br />
      Since first this isle my father&rsquo;s ashes held:<br />
      And now the rising day renews the year;<br />
      A day for ever sad, for ever dear.<br />
      This would I celebrate with annual games,<br />
      With gifts on altars pil&rsquo;d, and holy flames,<br />
      Tho&rsquo; banish&rsquo;d to Gaetulia&rsquo;s barren sands,<br />
      Caught on the Grecian seas, or hostile lands:<br />
      But since this happy storm our fleet has driv&rsquo;n<br />
      (Not, as I deem, without the will of Heav&rsquo;n)<br />
      Upon these friendly shores and flow&rsquo;ry plains,<br />
      Which hide Anchises and his blest remains,<br />
      Let us with joy perform his honours due,<br />
      And pray for prosp&rsquo;rous winds, our voyage to renew;<br />
      Pray, that in towns and temples of our own,<br />
      The name of great Anchises may be known,<br />
      And yearly games may spread the gods&rsquo; renown.<br />
      Our sports Acestes, of the Trojan race,<br />
      With royal gifts ordain&rsquo;d, is pleas&rsquo;d to grace:<br />
      Two steers on ev&rsquo;ry ship the king bestows;<br />
      His gods and ours shall share your equal vows.<br />
      Besides, if, nine days hence, the rosy morn<br />
      Shall with unclouded light the skies adorn,<br />
      That day with solemn sports I mean to grace:<br />
      Light galleys on the seas shall run a wat&rsquo;ry race;<br />
      Some shall in swiftness for the goal contend,<br />
      And others try the twanging bow to bend;<br />
      The strong, with iron gauntlets arm&rsquo;d, shall stand<br />
      Oppos&rsquo;d in combat on the yellow sand.<br />
      Let all be present at the games prepar&rsquo;d,<br />
      And joyful victors wait the just reward.<br />
      But now assist the rites, with garlands crown&rsquo;d.&rdquo;<br />
      He said, and first his brows with myrtle bound.<br />
      Then Helymus, by his example led,<br />
      And old Acestes, each adorn&rsquo;d his head;<br />
      Thus young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace,<br />
      His temples tied, and all the Trojan race.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Aeneas then advanc&rsquo;d amidst the train,<br />
      By thousands follow&rsquo;d thro&rsquo; the flow&rsquo;ry plain,<br />
      To great Anchises&rsquo; tomb; which when he found,<br />
      He pour&rsquo;d to Bacchus, on the hallow&rsquo;d ground,<br />
      Two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more,<br />
      And two from offer&rsquo;d bulls of purple gore,<br />
      With roses then the sepulcher he strow&rsquo;d<br />
      And thus his father&rsquo;s ghost bespoke aloud:<br />
      &ldquo;Hail, O ye holy manes! hail again,<br />
      Paternal ashes, now review&rsquo;d in vain!<br />
      The gods permitted not, that you, with me,<br />
      Should reach the promis&rsquo;d shores of Italy,<br />
      Or Tiber&rsquo;s flood, what flood soe&rsquo;er it be.&rdquo;<br />
      Scarce had he finish&rsquo;d, when, with speckled pride,<br />
      A serpent from the tomb began to glide;<br />
      His hugy bulk on sev&rsquo;n high volumes roll&rsquo;d;<br />
      Blue was his breadth of back, but streak&rsquo;d with scaly gold:<br />
      Thus riding on his curls, he seem&rsquo;d to pass<br />
      A rolling fire along, and singe the grass.<br />
      More various colours thro&rsquo; his body run,<br />
      Than Iris when her bow imbibes the sun.<br />
      Betwixt the rising altars, and around,<br />
      The sacred monster shot along the ground;<br />
      With harmless play amidst the bowls he pass&rsquo;d,<br />
      And with his lolling tongue assay&rsquo;d the taste:<br />
      Thus fed with holy food, the wondrous guest<br />
      Within the hollow tomb retir&rsquo;d to rest.<br />
      The pious prince, surpris&rsquo;d at what he view&rsquo;d,<br />
      The fun&rsquo;ral honours with more zeal renew&rsquo;d,<br />
      Doubtful if this place&rsquo;s genius were,<br />
      Or guardian of his father&rsquo;s sepulcher.<br />
      Five sheep, according to the rites, he slew;<br />
      As many swine, and steers of sable hue;<br />
      New gen&rsquo;rous wine he from the goblets pour&rsquo;d.<br />
      And call&rsquo;d his father&rsquo;s ghost, from hell restor&rsquo;d.<br />
      The glad attendants in long order come,<br />
      Off&rsquo;ring their gifts at great Anchises&rsquo; tomb:<br />
      Some add more oxen: some divide the spoil;<br />
      Some place the chargers on the grassy soil;<br />
      Some blow the fires, and offered entrails broil.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Now came the day desir&rsquo;d. The skies were bright<br />

      The mark to guide the mariners aright.<br />
      To bear with this, the seamen stretch their oars;<br />
      Then round the rock they steer, and seek the former shores.<br />
      The lots decide their place. Above the rest,<br />
      Each leader shining in his Tyrian vest;<br />
      The common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs<br />
      Their temples crown, and shade their sweaty brows:<br />
      Besmear&rsquo;d with oil, their naked shoulders shine.<br />
      All take their seats, and wait the sounding sign:<br />
      They gripe their oars; and ev&rsquo;ry panting breast<br />
      Is rais&rsquo;d by turns with hope, by turns with fear depress&rsquo;d.<br />
      The clangour of the trumpet gives the sign;<br />
      At once they start, advancing in a line:<br />
      With shouts the sailors rend the starry skies;<br />
      Lash&rsquo;d with their oars, the smoky billows rise;<br />
      Sparkles the briny main, and the vex&rsquo;d ocean fries.<br />
      Exact in time, with equal strokes they row:<br />
      At once the brushing oars and brazen prow<br />
      Dash up the sandy waves, and ope the depths below.<br />
      Not fiery coursers, in a chariot race,<br />
      Invade the field with half so swift a pace;<br />
      Not the fierce driver with more fury lends<br />
      The sounding lash, and, ere the stroke descends,<br />
      Low to the wheels his pliant body bends.<br />
      The partial crowd their hopes and fears divide,<br />
      And aid with eager shouts the favour&rsquo;d side.<br />
      Cries, murmurs, clamours, with a mixing sound,<br />
      From woods to woods, from hills to hills rebound.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Amidst the loud applauses of the shore,<br />
      Gyas outstripp&rsquo;d the rest, and sprung before:<br />
      Cloanthus, better mann&rsquo;d, pursued him fast,<br />
      But his o&rsquo;er-masted galley check&rsquo;d his haste.<br />
      The Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine<br />
      With equal oars, advancing in a line;<br />
      And now the mighty Centaur seems to lead,<br />
      And now the speedy Dolphin gets ahead;<br />
      Now board to board the rival vessels row,<br />
      The billows lave the skies, and ocean groans below.<br />
      They reach&rsquo;d the mark; proud Gyas and his train<br />
      In triumph rode, the victors of the main;<br />
      But, steering round, he charg&rsquo;d his pilot stand<br />
      More close to shore, and skim along the sand.<br />
      &ldquo;Let others bear to sea!&rdquo; Menoetes heard;<br />
      But secret shelves too cautiously he fear&rsquo;d,<br />
      And, fearing, sought the deep; and still aloof he steer&rsquo;d.<br />
      With louder cries the captain call&rsquo;d again:<br />
      &ldquo;Bear to the rocky shore, and shun the main.&rdquo;<br />
      He spoke, and, speaking, at his stern he saw<br />
      The bold Cloanthus near the shelvings draw.<br />
      Betwixt the mark and him the Scylla stood,<br />
      And in a closer compass plow&rsquo;d the flood.<br />
      He pass&rsquo;d the mark; and, wheeling, got before:<br />
      Gyas blasphem&rsquo;d the gods, devoutly swore,<br />
      Cried out for anger, and his hair he tore.<br />
      Mindless of others&rsquo; lives (so high was grown<br />
      His rising rage) and careless of his own,<br />
      The trembling dotard to the deck he drew;<br />
      Then hoisted up, and overboard he threw:<br />
      This done, he seiz&rsquo;d the helm; his fellows cheer&rsquo;d,<br />
      Turn&rsquo;d short upon the shelfs, and madly steer&rsquo;d.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Hardly his head the plunging pilot rears,<br />
      Clogg&rsquo;d with his clothes, and cumber&rsquo;d with his years:<br />
      Now dropping wet, he climbs the cliff with pain.<br />
      The crowd, that saw him fall and float again,<br />
      Shout from the distant shore; and loudly laugh&rsquo;d,<br />
      To see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught.<br />
      The following Centaur, and the Dolphin&rsquo;s crew,<br />
      Their vanish&rsquo;d hopes of victory renew;<br />
      While Gyas lags, they kindle in the race,<br />
      To reach the mark. Sergesthus takes the place;<br />
      Mnestheus pursues; and while around they wind,<br />
      Comes up, not half his galley&rsquo;s length behind;<br />
      Then, on the deck, amidst his mates appear&rsquo;d,<br />
      And thus their drooping courages he cheer&rsquo;d:<br />
      &ldquo;My friends, and Hector&rsquo;s followers heretofore,<br />
      Exert your vigour; tug the lab&rsquo;ring oar;<br />
      Stretch to your strokes, my still unconquer&rsquo;d crew,<br />
      Whom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew.<br />
      In this, our common int&rsquo;rest, let me find<br />
      That strength of hand, that courage of the mind,<br />
      As when you stemm&rsquo;d the strong Malean flood,<br />
      And o&rsquo;er the Syrtes&rsquo; broken billows row&rsquo;d.<br />
      I seek not now the foremost palm to gain;<br />
      Tho&rsquo; yet&mdash;&mdash;But, ah! that haughty wish is vain!<br />
      Let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain.<br />
      But to be last, the lags of all the race!<br />
      Redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace.&rdquo;<br />
      Now, one and all, they tug amain; they row<br />
      At the full stretch, and shake the brazen prow.<br />
      The sea beneath &rsquo;em sinks; their lab&rsquo;ring sides<br />
      Are swell&rsquo;d, and sweat runs gutt&rsquo;ring down in tides.<br />
      Chance aids their daring with unhop&rsquo;d success;<br />
      Sergesthus, eager with his beak to press<br />
      Betwixt the rival galley and the rock,<br />
      Shuts up th&rsquo; unwieldly Centaur in the lock.<br />
      The vessel struck; and, with the dreadful shock,<br />
      Her oars she shiver&rsquo;d, and her head she broke.<br />
      The trembling rowers from their banks arise,<br />
      And, anxious for themselves, renounce the prize.<br />
      With iron poles they heave her off the shores,<br />
      And gather from the sea their floating oars.<br />
      The crew of Mnestheus, with elated minds,<br />
      Urge their success, and call the willing winds;<br />
      Then ply their oars, and cut their liquid way<br />
      In larger compass on the roomy sea.<br />
      As, when the dove her rocky hold forsakes,<br />
      Rous&rsquo;d in a fright, her sounding wings she shakes;<br />
      The cavern rings with clatt&rsquo;ring; out she flies,<br />
      And leaves her callow care, and cleaves the skies:<br />
      At first she flutters; but at length she springs<br />
      To smoother flight, and shoots upon her wings:<br />
      So Mnestheus in the Dolphin cuts the sea;<br />
      And, flying with a force, that force assists his way.<br />
      Sergesthus in the Centaur soon he pass&rsquo;d,<br />
      Wedg&rsquo;d in the rocky shoals, and sticking fast.<br />
      In vain the victor he with cries implores,<br />
      And practices to row with shatter&rsquo;d oars.<br />
      Then Mnestheus bears with Gyas, and outflies:<br />
      The ship, without a pilot, yields the prize.<br />
      Unvanquish&rsquo;d Scylla now alone remains;<br />
      Her he pursues, and all his vigour strains.<br />
      Shouts from the fav&rsquo;ring multitude arise;<br />
      Applauding Echo to the shouts replies;<br />
      Shouts, wishes, and applause run rattling thro&rsquo; the skies.<br />
      These clamours with disdain the Scylla heard,<br />
      Much grudg&rsquo;d the praise, but more the robb&rsquo;d reward:<br />
      Resolv&rsquo;d to hold their own, they mend their pace,<br />
      All obstinate to die, or gain the race.<br />
      Rais&rsquo;d with success, the Dolphin swiftly ran;<br />
      For they can conquer, who believe they can.<br />
      Both urge their oars, and fortune both supplies,<br />
      And both perhaps had shar&rsquo;d an equal prize;<br />
      When to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands,<br />
      And succour from the wat&rsquo;ry pow&rsquo;rs demands:<br />
      &ldquo;Gods of the liquid realms, on which I row!<br />
      If, giv&rsquo;n by you, the laurel bind my brow,<br />
      Assist to make me guilty of my vow!<br />
      A snow-white bull shall on your shore be slain;<br />
      His offer&rsquo;d entrails cast into the main,<br />
      And ruddy wine, from golden goblets thrown,<br />
      Your grateful gift and my return shall own.&rdquo;<br />
      The choir of nymphs, and Phorcus, from below,<br />
      With virgin Panopea, heard his vow;<br />
      And old Portunus, with his breadth of hand,<br />
      Push&rsquo;d on, and sped the galley to the land.<br />
      Swift as a shaft, or winged wind, she flies,<br />
      And, darting to the port, obtains the prize.<br />

      From thence his way the Trojan hero bent<br />
      Into the neighb&rsquo;ring plain, with mountains pent,<br />
      Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood.<br />
      Full in the midst of this fair valley stood<br />
      A native theatre, which, rising slow<br />
      By just degrees, o&rsquo;erlook&rsquo;d the ground below.<br />
      High on a sylvan throne the leader sate;<br />
      A num&rsquo;rous train attend in solemn state.<br />
      Here those that in the rapid course delight,<br />
      Desire of honour and the prize invite.<br />
      The rival runners without order stand;<br />
      The Trojans mix&rsquo;d with the Sicilian band.<br />
      First Nisus, with Euryalus, appears;<br />
      Euryalus a boy of blooming years,<br />
      With sprightly grace and equal beauty crown&rsquo;d;<br />
      Nisus, for friendship to the youth renown&rsquo;d.<br />
      Diores next, of Priam&rsquo;s royal race,<br />
      Then Salius joined with Patron, took their place;<br />
      But Patron in Arcadia had his birth,<br />
      And Salius his from Arcananian earth;<br />
      Then two Sicilian youths, the names of these,<br />
      Swift Helymus, and lovely Panopes:<br />
      Both jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred,<br />
      And owning old Acestes for their head;<br />
      With sev&rsquo;ral others of ignobler name,<br />
      Whom time has not deliver&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er to fame.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      To these the hero thus his thoughts explain&rsquo;d,<br />
      In words which gen&rsquo;ral approbation gain&rsquo;d:<br />
      &ldquo;One common largess is for all design&rsquo;d,<br />
      The vanquish&rsquo;d and the victor shall be join&rsquo;d,<br />
      Two darts of polish&rsquo;d steel and Gnosian wood,<br />
      A silver-studded ax alike bestow&rsquo;d.<br />
      The foremost three have olive wreaths decreed:<br />
      The first of these obtains a stately steed,<br />
      Adorn&rsquo;d with trappings; and the next in fame,<br />
      The quiver of an Amazonian dame,<br />
      With feather&rsquo;d Thracian arrows well supplied:<br />
      A golden belt shall gird his manly side,<br />
      Which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied.<br />
      The third this Grecian helmet shall content.&rdquo;<br />
      He said. To their appointed base they went;<br />
      With beating hearts th&rsquo; expected sign receive,<br />
      And, starting all at once, the barrier leave.<br />
      Spread out, as on the winged winds, they flew,<br />
      And seiz&rsquo;d the distant goal with greedy view.<br />
      Shot from the crowd, swift Nisus all o&rsquo;erpass&rsquo;d;<br />
      Nor storms, nor thunder, equal half his haste.<br />
      The next, but tho&rsquo; the next, yet far disjoin&rsquo;d,<br />
      Came Salius, and Euryalus behind;<br />
      Then Helymus, whom young Diores plied,<br />
      Step after step, and almost side by side,<br />
      His shoulders pressing; and, in longer space,<br />
      Had won, or left at least a dubious race.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Now, spent, the goal they almost reach at last,<br />
      When eager Nisus, hapless in his haste,<br />
      Slipp&rsquo;d first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain,<br />
      Soak&rsquo;d with the blood of oxen newly slain.<br />
      The careless victor had not mark&rsquo;d his way;<br />
      But, treading where the treach&rsquo;rous puddle lay,<br />
      His heels flew up; and on the grassy floor<br />
      He fell, besmear&rsquo;d with filth and holy gore.<br />
      Not mindless then, Euryalus, of thee,<br />
      Nor of the sacred bonds of amity,<br />
      He strove th&rsquo; immediate rival&rsquo;s hope to cross,<br />
      And caught the foot of Salius as he rose.<br />
      So Salius lay extended on the plain;<br />
      Euryalus springs out, the prize to gain,<br />
      And leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend<br />
      The victor to the goal, who vanquish&rsquo;d by his friend.<br />
      Next Helymus; and then Diores came,<br />
      By two misfortunes made the third in fame.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      But Salius enters, and, exclaiming loud<br />
      For justice, deafens and disturbs the crowd;<br />
      Urges his cause may in the court be heard;<br />
      And pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr&rsquo;d.<br />
      But favour for Euryalus appears;<br />
      His blooming beauty, with his tender tears,<br />
      Had brib&rsquo;d the judges for the promis&rsquo;d prize.<br />
      Besides, Diores fills the court with cries,<br />
      Who vainly reaches at the last reward,<br />
      If the first palm on Salius be conferr&rsquo;d.<br />
      Then thus the prince: &ldquo;Let no disputes arise:<br />
      Where fortune plac&rsquo;d it, I award the prize.<br />
      But fortune&rsquo;s errors give me leave to mend,<br />
      At least to pity my deserving friend.&rdquo;<br />
      He said, and, from among the spoils, he draws<br />
      (Pond&rsquo;rous with shaggy mane and golden paws)<br />
      A lion&rsquo;s hide: to Salius this he gives.<br />
      Nisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves.<br />
      &ldquo;If such rewards to vanquish&rsquo;d men are due.&rdquo;<br />
      He said, &ldquo;and falling is to rise by you,<br />
      What prize may Nisus from your bounty claim,<br />
      Who merited the first rewards and fame?<br />
      In falling, both an equal fortune tried;<br />
      Would fortune for my fall so well provide!&rdquo;<br />
      With this he pointed to his face, and show&rsquo;d<br />
      His hand and all his habit smear&rsquo;d with blood.<br />
      Th&rsquo; indulgent father of the people smil&rsquo;d,<br />
      And caus&rsquo;d to be produc&rsquo;d an ample shield,<br />
      Of wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought,<br />
      Long since from Neptune&rsquo;s bars in triumph brought.<br />

      Renounc&rsquo;d his challenge, and refus&rsquo;d to fight.<br />
      Astonish&rsquo;d at their weight, the hero stands,<br />
      And pois&rsquo;d the pond&rsquo;rous engines in his hands.<br />
      &ldquo;What had your wonder,&rdquo; said Entellus, &ldquo;been,<br />
      Had you the gauntlets of Alcides seen,<br />
      Or view&rsquo;d the stern debate on this unhappy green!<br />
      These which I bear your brother Eryx bore,<br />
      Still mark&rsquo;d with batter&rsquo;d brains and mingled gore.<br />
      With these he long sustain&rsquo;d th&rsquo; Herculean arm;<br />
      And these I wielded while my blood was warm,<br />
      This languish&rsquo;d frame while better spirits fed,<br />
      Ere age unstrung my nerves, or time o&rsquo;ersnow&rsquo;d my head.<br />
      But if the challenger these arms refuse,<br />
      And cannot wield their weight, or dare not use;<br />
      If great Aeneas and Acestes join<br />
      In his request, these gauntlets I resign;<br />
      Let us with equal arms perform the fight,<br />
      And let him leave to fear, since I resign my right.&rdquo;<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      This said, Entellus for the strife prepares;<br />
      Stripp&rsquo;d of his quilted coat, his body bares;<br />
      Compos&rsquo;d of mighty bones and brawn he stands,<br />
      A goodly tow&rsquo;ring object on the sands.<br />
      Then just Aeneas equal arms supplied,<br />
      Which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied.<br />
      Both on the tiptoe stand, at full extent,<br />
      Their arms aloft, their bodies inly bent;<br />
      Their heads from aiming blows they bear afar;<br />
      With clashing gauntlets then provoke the war.<br />
      One on his youth and pliant limbs relies;<br />
      One on his sinews and his giant size.<br />
      The last is stiff with age, his motion slow;<br />
      He heaves for breath, he staggers to and fro,<br />
      And clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow.<br />
      Yet equal in success, they ward, they strike;<br />
      Their ways are diff&rsquo;rent, but their art alike.<br />
      Before, behind, the blows are dealt; around<br />
      Their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound.<br />
      A storm of strokes, well meant, with fury flies,<br />
      And errs about their temples, ears, and eyes.<br />
      Nor always errs; for oft the gauntlet draws<br />
      A sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws.<br />
      Heavy with age, Entellus stands his ground,<br />
      But with his warping body wards the wound.<br />
      His hand and watchful eye keep even pace;<br />
      While Dares traverses and shifts his place,<br />
      And, like a captain who beleaguers round<br />
      Some strong-built castle on a rising ground,<br />
      Views all th&rsquo; approaches with observing eyes:<br />
      This and that other part in vain he tries,<br />
      And more on industry than force relies.<br />
      With hands on high, Entellus threats the foe;<br />
      But Dares watch&rsquo;d the motion from below,<br />
      And slipp&rsquo;d aside, and shunn&rsquo;d the long descending blow.<br />
      Entellus wastes his forces on the wind,<br />
      And, thus deluded of the stroke design&rsquo;d,<br />
      Headlong and heavy fell; his ample breast<br />
      And weighty limbs his ancient mother press&rsquo;d.<br />
      So falls a hollow pine, that long had stood<br />
      On Ida&rsquo;s height, or Erymanthus&rsquo; wood,<br />
      Torn from the roots. The diff&rsquo;ring nations rise,<br />
      And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies,<br />
      Acestus runs with eager haste, to raise<br />
      The fall&rsquo;n companion of his youthful days.<br />
      Dauntless he rose, and to the fight return&rsquo;d;<br />
      With shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burn&rsquo;d.<br />
      Disdain and conscious virtue fir&rsquo;d his breast,<br />
      And with redoubled force his foe he press&rsquo;d.<br />
      He lays on load with either hand, amain,<br />
      And headlong drives the Trojan o&rsquo;er the plain;<br />
      Nor stops, nor stays; nor rest nor breath allows;<br />
      But storms of strokes descend about his brows,<br />
      A rattling tempest, and a hail of blows.<br />
      But now the prince, who saw the wild increase<br />
      Of wounds, commands the combatants to cease,<br />
      And bounds Entellus&rsquo; wrath, and bids the peace.<br />
      First to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came,<br />
      And sooth&rsquo;d his sorrow for the suffer&rsquo;d shame.<br />
      &ldquo;What fury seiz&rsquo;d my friend? The gods,&rdquo; said he,<br />
      &ldquo;To him propitious, and averse to thee,<br />
      Have giv&rsquo;n his arm superior force to thine.<br />
      &rsquo;Tis madness to contend with strength divine.&rdquo;<br />
      The gauntlet fight thus ended, from the shore<br />
      His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore:<br />
      His mouth and nostrils pour&rsquo;d a purple flood,<br />
      And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.<br />
      Faintly he stagger&rsquo;d thro&rsquo; the hissing throng,<br />
      And hung his head, and trail&rsquo;d his legs along.<br />
      The sword and casque are carried by his train;<br />
      But with his foe the palm and ox remain.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      The champion, then, before Aeneas came,<br />
      Proud of his prize, but prouder of his fame:<br />
      &ldquo;O goddess-born, and you, Dardanian host,<br />
      Mark with attention, and forgive my boast;<br />
      Learn what I was, by what remains; and know<br />
      From what impending fate you sav&rsquo;d my foe.&rdquo;<br />
      Sternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull;<br />
      And, on his ample forehead aiming full,<br />
      The deadly stroke, descending, pierc&rsquo;d the skull.<br />
      Down drops the beast, nor needs a second wound,<br />
      But sprawls in pangs of death, and spurns the ground.<br />
      Then, thus: &ldquo;In Dares&rsquo; stead I offer this.<br />
      Eryx, accept a nobler sacrifice;<br />
      Take the last gift my wither&rsquo;d arms can yield:<br />
      Thy gauntlets I resign, and here renounce the field.&rdquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      This done, Aeneas orders, for the close,<br />
      The strife of archers with contending bows.<br />
      The mast Sergesthus&rsquo; shatter&rsquo;d galley bore<br />
      With his own hands he raises on the shore.<br />
      A flutt&rsquo;ring dove upon the top they tie,<br />
      The living mark at which their arrows fly.<br />
      The rival archers in a line advance,<br />
      Their turn of shooting to receive from chance.<br />
      A helmet holds their names; the lots are drawn:<br />
      On the first scroll was read Hippocoon.<br />
      The people shout. Upon the next was found<br />
      Young Mnestheus, late with naval honours crown&rsquo;d.<br />
      The third contain&rsquo;d Eurytion&rsquo;s noble name,<br />
      Thy brother, Pandarus, and next in fame,<br />
      Whom Pallas urg&rsquo;d the treaty to confound,<br />
      And send among the Greeks a feather&rsquo;d wound.<br />
      Acestes in the bottom last remain&rsquo;d,<br />
      Whom not his age from youthful sports restrain&rsquo;d.<br />
      Soon all with vigour bend their trusty bows,<br />
      And from the quiver each his arrow chose.<br />
      Hippocoon&rsquo;s was the first: with forceful sway<br />
      It flew, and, whizzing, cut the liquid way.<br />
      Fix&rsquo;d in the mast the feather&rsquo;d weapon stands:<br />
      The fearful pigeon flutters in her bands,<br />
      And the tree trembled, and the shouting cries<br />
      Of the pleas&rsquo;d people rend the vaulted skies.<br />
      Then Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove,<br />
      With lifted eyes, and took his aim above,<br />
      But made a glancing shot, and missed the dove;<br />
      Yet miss&rsquo;d so narrow, that he cut the cord<br />
      Which fasten&rsquo;d by the foot the flitting bird.<br />
      The captive thus releas&rsquo;d, away she flies,<br />
      And beats with clapping wings the yielding skies.<br />
      His bow already bent, Eurytion stood;<br />
      And, having first invok&rsquo;d his brother god,<br />
      His winged shaft with eager haste he sped.<br />
      The fatal message reach&rsquo;d her as she fled:<br />
      She leaves her life aloft; she strikes the ground,<br />
      And renders back the weapon in the wound.<br />
      Acestes, grudging at his lot, remains,<br />
      Without a prize to gratify his pains.<br />
      Yet, shooting upward, sends his shaft, to show<br />
      An archer&rsquo;s art, and boast his twanging bow.<br />
      The feather&rsquo;d arrow gave a dire portent,<br />
      And latter augurs judge from this event.<br />
      Chaf&rsquo;d by the speed, it fir&rsquo;d; and, as it flew,<br />
      A trail of following flames ascending drew:<br />
      Kindling they mount, and mark the shiny way;<br />
      Across the skies as falling meteors play,<br />
      And vanish into wind, or in a blaze decay.<br />
      The Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare,<br />
      And, trembling, turn their wonder into pray&rsquo;r.<br />
      The Dardan prince put on a smiling face,<br />
      And strain&rsquo;d Acestes with a close embrace;<br />
      Then, hon&rsquo;ring him with gifts above the rest,<br />
      Turn&rsquo;d the bad omen, nor his fears confess&rsquo;d.<br />
      &ldquo;The gods,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;this miracle have wrought,<br />
      And order&rsquo;d you the prize without the lot.<br />
      Accept this goblet, rough with figur&rsquo;d gold,<br />
      Which Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old:<br />
      This pledge of ancient amity receive,<br />
      Which to my second sire I justly give.&rdquo;<br />
      He said, and, with the trumpets&rsquo; cheerful sound,<br />
      Proclaim&rsquo;d him victor, and with laurel-crown&rsquo;d.<br />
      Nor good Eurytion envied him the prize,<br />
      Tho&rsquo; he transfix&rsquo;d the pigeon in the skies.<br />
      Who cut the line, with second gifts was grac&rsquo;d;<br />
      The third was his whose arrow pierc&rsquo;d the mast.<br />

      Which, hissing thro&rsquo; the planks, the flames prevent,<br />
      And stop the fiery pest. Four ships alone<br />
      Burn to the waist, and for the fleet atone.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      But doubtful thoughts the hero&rsquo;s heart divide;<br />
      If he should still in Sicily reside,<br />
      Forgetful of his fates, or tempt the main,<br />

      Then Nautes, old and wise, to whom alone<br />
      The will of Heav&rsquo;n by Pallas was foreshown;<br />
      Vers&rsquo;d in portents, experienc&rsquo;d, and inspir&rsquo;d<br />
      To tell events, and what the fates requir&rsquo;d;<br />

      Trust in his hands your old and useless train;<br />
      Too num&rsquo;rous for the ships which yet remain:<br />
      The feeble, old, indulgent of their ease,<br />
      The dames who dread the dangers of the seas,<br />
      With all the dastard crew, who dare not stand<br />
      The shock of battle with your foes by land.<br />
      Here you may build a common town for all,<br />
      And, from Acestes&rsquo; name, Acesta call.&rdquo;<br />
      The reasons, with his friend&rsquo;s experience join&rsquo;d,<br />

    <p class="poem">
      &rsquo;Twas dead of night; when to his slumb&rsquo;ring eyes<br />
      His father&rsquo;s shade descended from the skies,<br />
      And thus he spoke: &ldquo;O more than vital breath,<br />
      Lov&rsquo;d while I liv&rsquo;d, and dear ev&rsquo;n after death;<br />
      O son, in various toils and troubles toss&rsquo;d,<br />
      The King of Heav&rsquo;n employs my careful ghost<br />
      On his commands: the god, who sav&rsquo;d from fire<br />
      Your flaming fleet, and heard your just desire.<br />
      The wholesome counsel of your friend receive,<br />
      And here the coward train and woman leave:<br />
      The chosen youth, and those who nobly dare,<br />
      Transport, to tempt the dangers of the war.<br />
      The stern Italians will their courage try;<br />
      Rough are their manners, and their minds are high.<br />
      But first to Pluto&rsquo;s palace you shall go,<br />
      And seek my shade among the blest below:<br />
      For not with impious ghosts my soul remains,<br />
      Nor suffers with the damn&rsquo;d perpetual pains,<br />
      But breathes the living air of soft Elysian plains.<br />
      The chaste Sibylla shall your steps convey,<br />
      And blood of offer&rsquo;d victims free the way.<br />
      There shall you know what realms the gods assign,<br />
      And learn the fates and fortunes of your line.<br />
      But now, farewell! I vanish with the night,<br />
      And feel the blast of heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s approaching light.&rdquo;<br />
      He said, and mix&rsquo;d with shades, and took his airy flight.<br />
      &ldquo;Whither so fast?&rdquo; the filial duty cried;<br />
      &ldquo;And why, ah why, the wish&rsquo;d embrace denied?&rdquo;<br />

      Next, for his friends and royal host he sent,<br />

      Nine days they pass in feasts, their temples crown&rsquo;d;<br />

      But you can witness its effects too well.<br />
      You saw the storm she rais&rsquo;d on Libyan floods,<br />

      How much your lov&rsquo;d Aeneas is my care.<br />

      And dash&rsquo;d against the walls the trembling train;<br />
      When floods were fill&rsquo;d with bodies of the slain;<br />
      When crimson Xanthus, doubtful of his way,<br />
      Stood up on ridges to behold the sea;<br />
      New heaps came tumbling in, and chok&rsquo;d his way;<br />
      When your Aeneas fought, but fought with odds<br />
      Of force unequal, and unequal gods;<br />
      I spread a cloud before the victor&rsquo;s sight,<br />
      Sustain&rsquo;d the vanquish&rsquo;d, and secur&rsquo;d his flight;<br />
      Ev&rsquo;n then secur&rsquo;d him, when I sought with joy<br />

      High on the waves his azure car he guides;<br />

      The tempests fly before their father&rsquo;s face,<br />
      Trains of inferior gods his triumph grace,<br />
      And monster whales before their master play,<br />
      And choirs of Tritons crowd the wat&rsquo;ry way.<br />
      The marshal&rsquo;d pow&rsquo;rs in equal troops divide<br />
      To right and left; the gods his better side<br />

      Now smiling hope, with sweet vicissitude,<br />

      The cheerful crew with diligence obey;<br />
      They scud before the wind, and sail in open sea.<br />
      Ahead of all the master pilot steers;<br />
      And, as he leads, the following navy veers.<br />
      The steeds of Night had travel&rsquo;d half the sky,<br />
      The drowsy rowers on their benches lie,<br />
      When the soft God of Sleep, with easy flight,<br />
      Descends, and draws behind a trail of light.<br />
      Thou, Palinurus, art his destin&rsquo;d prey;<br />
      To thee alone he takes his fatal way.<br />
      Dire dreams to thee, and iron sleep, he bears;<br />
      And, lighting on thy prow, the form of Phorbas wears.<br />

      &ldquo;The winds, my friend, inspire a pleasing gale;<br />
      The ships, without thy care, securely sail.<br />
      Now steal an hour of sweet repose; and I<br />
      Will take the rudder and thy room supply.&rdquo;<br />

      &ldquo;Me dost thou bid to trust the treach&rsquo;rous deep,<br />
      The harlot smiles of her dissembling face,<br />
      And to her faith commit the Trojan race?<br />
      Shall I believe the Siren South again,<br />
      And, oft betray&rsquo;d, not know the monster main?&rdquo;<br />
      He said: his fasten&rsquo;d hands the rudder keep,<br />
      And, fix&rsquo;d on heav&rsquo;n, his eyes repel invading sleep.<br />
      The god was wroth, and at his temples threw<br />
      A branch in Lethe dipp&rsquo;d, and drunk with Stygian dew:<br />
      The pilot, vanquish&rsquo;d by the pow&rsquo;r divine,<br />
      Soon clos&rsquo;d his swimming eyes, and lay supine.<br />
      Scarce were his limbs extended at their length,<br />
      The god, insulting with superior strength,<br />
      Fell heavy on him, plung&rsquo;d him in the sea,<br />
      And, with the stern, the rudder tore away.<br />
      Headlong he fell, and, struggling in the main,<br />
      Cried out for helping hands, but cried in vain.<br />
      The victor daemon mounts obscure in air,<br />
      While the ship sails without the pilot&rsquo;s care.<br />
      On Neptune&rsquo;s faith the floating fleet relies;<br />
      But what the man forsook, the god supplies,<br />
      And o&rsquo;er the dang&rsquo;rous deep secure the navy flies;<br />
      Glides by the Sirens&rsquo; cliffs, a shelfy coast,<br />
      Long infamous for ships and sailors lost,<br />
      And white with bones. Th&rsquo; impetuous ocean roars,<br />
      And rocks rebellow from the sounding shores.<br />
      The watchful hero felt the knocks, and found<br />
      The tossing vessel sail&rsquo;d on shoaly ground.<br />
      Sure of his pilot&rsquo;s loss, he takes himself<br />
      The helm, and steers aloof, and shuns the shelf.<br />
      Inly he griev&rsquo;d, and, groaning from the breast,<br />
      Deplor&rsquo;d his death; and thus his pain express&rsquo;d:<br />
      &ldquo;For faith repos&rsquo;d on seas, and on the flatt&rsquo;ring sky,<br />
      Thy naked corpse is doom&rsquo;d on shores unknown to lie.&rdquo;<br />

    <h5> THE ARGUMENT. </h5>
    
    <p>
      The Sibyl foretells Aeneas the adventures he should meet with in Italy. She
      attends him to hell; describing to him the various scenes of that place, and
      conducting him to his father Anchises, who instructs him in those sublime
      mysteries, of the soul of the world, and the transmigration; and shows him
      that glorious race of heroes, which was to descend from him and his posterity.

      They turn their heads to sea, their sterns to land,<br />
      And greet with greedy joy th&rsquo; Italian strand.<br />
      Some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed;<br />
      Some gather sticks, the kindled flames to feed,<br />

      Thus, while their sev&rsquo;ral charges they fulfil,<br />
      The pious prince ascends the sacred hill<br />
      Where Phoebus is ador&rsquo;d; and seeks the shade<br />

      Androgeos&rsquo; death, and off&rsquo;rings to his ghost;<br />
      Sev&rsquo;n youths from Athens yearly sent, to meet<br />
      The fate appointed by revengeful Crete.<br />
      And next to those the dreadful urn was plac&rsquo;d,<br />
      In which the destin&rsquo;d names by lots were cast:<br />
      The mournful parents stand around in tears,<br />
      And rising Crete against their shore appears.<br />
      There too, in living sculpture, might be seen<br />
      The mad affection of the Cretan queen;<br />
      Then how she cheats her bellowing lover&rsquo;s eye;<br />
      The rushing leap, the doubtful progeny,<br />
      The lower part a beast, a man above,<br />

      A thousand doors, a thousand winding ways:<br />

      Not to be found, but by the faithful clue;<br />
      Till the kind artist, mov&rsquo;d with pious grief,<br />

      Thro&rsquo; the hill&rsquo;s hollow sides: before the place,<br />

      Her hair stood up; convulsive rage possess&rsquo;d<br />
      Her trembling limbs, and heav&rsquo;d her lab&rsquo;ring breast.<br />
      Greater than humankind she seem&rsquo;d to look,<br />
      And with an accent more than mortal spoke.<br />
      Her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll;<br />
      When all the god came rushing on her soul.<br />
      Swiftly she turn&rsquo;d, and, foaming as she spoke:<br />
      &ldquo;Why this delay?&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;the pow&rsquo;rs invoke!<br />

      Thy troops shall reach, but, having reach&rsquo;d, repent.<br />
      Wars, horrid wars, I view; a field of blood,<br />
      And Tiber rolling with a purple flood.<br />
      Simois nor Xanthus shall be wanting there:<br />
      A new Achilles shall in arms appear,<br />
      And he, too, goddess-born. Fierce Juno&rsquo;s hate,<br />
      Added to hostile force, shall urge thy fate.<br />
      To what strange nations shalt not thou resort,<br />
      Driv&rsquo;n to solicit aid at ev&rsquo;ry court!<br />
      The cause the same which Ilium once oppress&rsquo;d;<br />
      A foreign mistress, and a foreign guest.<br />
      But thou, secure of soul, unbent with woes,<br />
      The more thy fortune frowns, the more oppose.<br />
      The dawnings of thy safety shall be shown<br />
      From whence thou least shalt hope, a Grecian town.&rdquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Thus, from the dark recess, the Sibyl spoke,<br />
      And the resisting air the thunder broke;<br />
      The cave rebellow&rsquo;d, and the temple shook.<br />
      Th&rsquo; ambiguous god, who rul&rsquo;d her lab&rsquo;ring breast,<br />
      In these mysterious words his mind express&rsquo;d;<br />
      Some truths reveal&rsquo;d, in terms involv&rsquo;d the rest.<br />
      At length her fury fell, her foaming ceas&rsquo;d,<br />
      And, ebbing in her soul, the god decreas&rsquo;d.<br />
      Then thus the chief: &ldquo;No terror to my view,<br />
      No frightful face of danger can be new.<br />
      Inur&rsquo;d to suffer, and resolv&rsquo;d to dare,<br />
      The Fates, without my pow&rsquo;r, shall be without my care.<br />
      This let me crave, since near your grove the road<br />
      To hell lies open, and the dark abode<br />
      Which Acheron surrounds, th&rsquo; innavigable flood;<br />
      Conduct me thro&rsquo; the regions void of light,<br />
      And lead me longing to my father&rsquo;s sight.<br />
      For him, a thousand dangers I have sought,<br />
      And, rushing where the thickest Grecians fought,<br />
      Safe on my back the sacred burthen brought.<br />
      He, for my sake, the raging ocean tried,<br />
      And wrath of Heav&rsquo;n, my still auspicious guide,<br />
      And bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied.<br />
      Oft, since he breath&rsquo;d his last, in dead of night<br />
      His reverend image stood before my sight;<br />
      Enjoin&rsquo;d to seek, below, his holy shade;<br />
      Conducted there by your unerring aid.<br />
      But you, if pious minds by pray&rsquo;rs are won,<br />
      Oblige the father, and protect the son.<br />
      Yours is the pow&rsquo;r; nor Proserpine in vain<br />
      Has made you priestess of her nightly reign.<br />
      If Orpheus, arm&rsquo;d with his enchanting lyre,<br />
      The ruthless king with pity could inspire,<br />
      And from the shades below redeem his wife;<br />
      If Pollux, off&rsquo;ring his alternate life,<br />
      Could free his brother, and can daily go<br />
      By turns aloft, by turns descend below:<br />
      Why name I Theseus, or his greater friend,<br />
      Who trod the downward path, and upward could ascend?<br />
      Not less than theirs from Jove my lineage came;<br />
      My mother greater, my descent the same.&rdquo;<br />
      So pray&rsquo;d the Trojan prince, and, while he pray&rsquo;d,<br />
      His hand upon the holy altar laid.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Then thus replied the prophetess divine:<br />
      &ldquo;O goddess-born of great Anchises&rsquo; line,<br />
      The gates of hell are open night and day;<br />
      Smooth the descent, and easy is the way:<br />
      But to return, and view the cheerful skies,<br />
      In this the task and mighty labour lies.<br />
      To few great Jupiter imparts this grace,<br />
      And those of shining worth and heav&rsquo;nly race.<br />
      Betwixt those regions and our upper light,<br />
      Deep forests and impenetrable night<br />
      Possess the middle space: th&rsquo; infernal bounds<br />
      Cocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds.<br />
      But if so dire a love your soul invades,<br />
      As twice below to view the trembling shades;<br />
      If you so hard a toil will undertake,<br />
      As twice to pass th&rsquo; innavigable lake;<br />
      Receive my counsel. In the neighb&rsquo;ring grove<br />
      There stands a tree; the queen of Stygian Jove<br />
      Claims it her own; thick woods and gloomy night<br />
      Conceal the happy plant from human sight.<br />
      One bough it bears; but wondrous to behold!<br />
      The ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold:<br />
      This from the vulgar branches must be torn,<br />
      And to fair Proserpine the present borne,<br />
      Ere leave be giv&rsquo;n to tempt the nether skies.<br />
      The first thus rent a second will arise,<br />
      And the same metal the same room supplies.<br />
      Look round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see<br />
      The lurking gold upon the fatal tree:<br />
      Then rend it off, as holy rites command;<br />
      The willing metal will obey thy hand,<br />
      Following with ease, if favour&rsquo;d by thy fate,<br />
      Thou art foredoom&rsquo;d to view the Stygian state:<br />
      If not, no labour can the tree constrain;<br />
      And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain.<br />
      Besides, you know not, while you here attend,<br />
      Th&rsquo; unworthy fate of your unhappy friend:<br />
      Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost,<br />
      Depriv&rsquo;d of fun&rsquo;ral rites, pollutes your host.<br />
      Pay first his pious dues; and, for the dead,<br />
      Two sable sheep around his hearse be led;<br />
      Then, living turfs upon his body lay:<br />
      This done, securely take the destin&rsquo;d way,<br />
      To find the regions destitute of day.&rdquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      She said, and held her peace. Aeneas went<br />
      Sad from the cave, and full of discontent,<br />
      Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant.<br />
      Achates, the companion of his breast,<br />
      Goes grieving by his side, with equal cares oppress&rsquo;d.<br />
      Walking, they talk&rsquo;d, and fruitlessly divin&rsquo;d<br />
      What friend the priestess by those words design&rsquo;d.<br />
      But soon they found an object to deplore:<br />
      Misenus lay extended on the shore;<br />
      Son of the God of Winds: none so renown&rsquo;d<br />
      The warrior trumpet in the field to sound;<br />
      With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms,<br />
      And rouse to dare their fate in honourable arms.<br />
      He serv&rsquo;d great Hector, and was ever near,<br />
      Not with his trumpet only, but his spear.<br />
      But by Pelides&rsquo; arms when Hector fell,<br />
      He chose Aeneas; and he chose as well.<br />
      Swoln with applause, and aiming still at more,<br />
      He now provokes the sea gods from the shore;<br />
      With envy Triton heard the martial sound,<br />
      And the bold champion, for his challenge, drown&rsquo;d;<br />
      Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand:<br />
      The gazing crowd around the body stand.<br />
      All weep; but most Aeneas mourns his fate,<br />
      And hastens to perform the funeral state.<br />
      In altar-wise, a stately pile they rear;<br />
      The basis broad below, and top advanc&rsquo;d in air.<br />
      An ancient wood, fit for the work design&rsquo;d,<br />
      (The shady covert of the salvage kind,)<br />
      The Trojans found: the sounding ax is plied;<br />
      Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the tow&rsquo;ring pride<br />
      Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke,<br />
      And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.<br />
      Huge trunks of trees, fell&rsquo;d from the steepy crown<br />
      Of the bare mountains, roll with ruin down.<br />
      Arm&rsquo;d like the rest the Trojan prince appears,<br />
      And by his pious labour urges theirs.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Thus while he wrought, revolving in his mind<br />
      The ways to compass what his wish design&rsquo;d,<br />
      He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove,<br />
      And then with vows implor&rsquo;d the Queen of Love:<br />
      &ldquo;O may thy pow&rsquo;r, propitious still to me,<br />
      Conduct my steps to find the fatal tree,<br />
      In this deep forest; since the Sibyl&rsquo;s breath<br />
      Foretold, alas! too true, Misenus&rsquo; death.&rdquo;<br />
      Scarce had he said, when, full before his sight,<br />
      Two doves, descending from their airy flight,<br />
      Secure upon the grassy plain alight.<br />
      He knew his mother&rsquo;s birds; and thus he pray&rsquo;d:<br />
      &ldquo;Be you my guides, with your auspicious aid,<br />
      And lead my footsteps, till the branch be found,<br />
      Whose glitt&rsquo;ring shadow gilds the sacred ground.<br />
      And thou, great parent, with celestial care,<br />
      In this distress be present to my pray&rsquo;r!&rdquo;<br />
      Thus having said, he stopp&rsquo;d with watchful sight,<br />
      Observing still the motions of their flight,<br />
      What course they took, what happy signs they shew.<br />
      They fed, and, flutt&rsquo;ring, by degrees withdrew<br />
      Still farther from the place, but still in view:<br />
      Hopping and flying, thus they led him on<br />
      To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun<br />
      They wing&rsquo;d their flight aloft; then, stooping low,<br />
      Perch&rsquo;d on the double tree that bears the golden bough.<br />
      Thro&rsquo; the green leafs the glitt&rsquo;ring shadows glow;<br />
      As, on the sacred oak, the wintry mistletoe,<br />
      Where the proud mother views her precious brood,<br />
      And happier branches, which she never sow&rsquo;d.<br />
      Such was the glitt&rsquo;ring; such the ruddy rind,<br />
      And dancing leaves, that wanton&rsquo;d in the wind.<br />
      He seiz&rsquo;d the shining bough with griping hold,<br />
      And rent away, with ease, the ling&rsquo;ring gold;<br />
      Then to the Sibyl&rsquo;s palace bore the prize.<br />
      Meantime the Trojan troops, with weeping eyes,<br />
      To dead Misenus pay his obsequies.<br />
      First, from the ground a lofty pile they rear,<br />
      Of pitch trees, oaks, and pines, and unctuous fir:<br />
      The fabric&rsquo;s front with cypress twigs they strew,<br />
      And stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew.<br />
      The topmost part his glitt&rsquo;ring arms adorn;<br />
      Warm waters, then, in brazen caldrons borne,<br />
      Are pour&rsquo;d to wash his body, joint by joint,<br />
      And fragrant oils the stiffen&rsquo;d limbs anoint.<br />
      With groans and cries Misenus they deplore:<br />
      Then on a bier, with purple cover&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er,<br />
      The breathless body, thus bewail&rsquo;d, they lay,<br />
      And fire the pile, their faces turn&rsquo;d away:<br />
      Such reverend rites their fathers us&rsquo;d to pay.<br />
      Pure oil and incense on the fire they throw,<br />
      And fat of victims, which his friends bestow.<br />
      These gifts the greedy flames to dust devour;<br />
      Then on the living coals red wine they pour;<br />
      And, last, the relics by themselves dispose,<br />
      Which in a brazen urn the priests inclose.<br />
      Old Corynaeus compass&rsquo;d thrice the crew,<br />
      And dipp&rsquo;d an olive branch in holy dew;<br />
      Which thrice he sprinkled round, and thrice aloud<br />
      Invok&rsquo;d the dead, and then dismissed the crowd.<br />
      But good Aeneas order&rsquo;d on the shore<br />
      A stately tomb, whose top a trumpet bore,<br />
      A soldier&rsquo;s falchion, and a seaman&rsquo;s oar.<br />
      Thus was his friend interr&rsquo;d; and deathless fame<br />
      Still to the lofty cape consigns his name.<br />
      These rites perform&rsquo;d, the prince, without delay,<br />
      Hastes to the nether world his destin&rsquo;d way.<br />
      Deep was the cave; and, downward as it went<br />
      From the wide mouth, a rocky rough descent;<br />
      And here th&rsquo; access a gloomy grove defends,<br />
      And there th&rsquo; unnavigable lake extends,<br />
      O&rsquo;er whose unhappy waters, void of light,<br />
      No bird presumes to steer his airy flight;<br />
      Such deadly stenches from the depths arise,<br />
      And steaming sulphur, that infects the skies.<br />
      From hence the Grecian bards their legends make,<br />
      And give the name Avernus to the lake.<br />
      Four sable bullocks, in the yoke untaught,<br />
      For sacrifice the pious hero brought.<br />
      The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns;<br />
      Then cuts the curling hair; that first oblation burns,<br />
      Invoking Hecate hither to repair:<br />
      A pow&rsquo;rful name in hell and upper air.<br />
      The sacred priests with ready knives bereave<br />
      The beasts of life, and in full bowls receive<br />
      The streaming blood: a lamb to Hell and Night<br />
      (The sable wool without a streak of white)<br />
      Aeneas offers; and, by fate&rsquo;s decree,<br />
      A barren heifer, Proserpine, to thee,<br />
      With holocausts he Pluto&rsquo;s altar fills;<br />
      Sev&rsquo;n brawny bulls with his own hand he kills;<br />
      Then on the broiling entrails oil he pours;<br />
      Which, ointed thus, the raging flame devours.<br />
      Late the nocturnal sacrifice begun,<br />
      Nor ended till the next returning sun.<br />
      Then earth began to bellow, trees to dance,<br />
      And howling dogs in glimm&rsquo;ring light advance,<br />
      Ere Hecate came. &ldquo;Far hence be souls profane!&rdquo;<br />
      The Sibyl cried, &ldquo;and from the grove abstain!<br />
      Now, Trojan, take the way thy fates afford;<br />
      Assume thy courage, and unsheathe thy sword.&rdquo;<br />
      She said, and pass&rsquo;d along the gloomy space;<br />
      The prince pursued her steps with equal pace.<br />

      A youthful vigour and autumnal green.<br />

      His course from Afric to the Latian shore,<br />

      Think&rsquo;st thou, thus unintomb&rsquo;d, to cross the floods,<br />
      To view the Furies and infernal gods,<br />
      And visit, without leave, the dark abodes?<br />
      Attend the term of long revolving years;<br />
      Fate, and the dooming gods, are deaf to tears.<br />
      This comfort of thy dire misfortune take:<br />
      The wrath of Heav&rsquo;n, inflicted for thy sake,<br />
      With vengeance shall pursue th&rsquo; inhuman coast,<br />
      Till they propitiate thy offended ghost,<br />
      And raise a tomb, with vows and solemn pray&rsquo;r;<br />
      And Palinurus&rsquo; name the place shall bear.&rdquo;<br />
      This calm&rsquo;d his cares; sooth&rsquo;d with his future fame,<br />
      And pleas&rsquo;d to hear his propagated name.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Now nearer to the Stygian lake they draw:<br />
      Whom, from the shore, the surly boatman saw;<br />
      Observ&rsquo;d their passage thro&rsquo; the shady wood,<br />
      And mark&rsquo;d their near approaches to the flood.<br />
      Then thus he call&rsquo;d aloud, inflam&rsquo;d with wrath:<br />
      &ldquo;Mortal, whate&rsquo;er, who this forbidden path<br />
      In arms presum&rsquo;st to tread, I charge thee, stand,<br />
      And tell thy name, and bus&rsquo;ness in the land.<br />
      Know this, the realm of night; the Stygian shore:<br />
      My boat conveys no living bodies o&rsquo;er;<br />
      Nor was I pleas&rsquo;d great Theseus once to bear,<br />
      Who forc&rsquo;d a passage with his pointed spear,<br />
      Nor strong Alcides, men of mighty fame,<br />
      And from th&rsquo; immortal gods their lineage came.<br />
      In fetters one the barking porter tied,<br />
      And took him trembling from his sov&rsquo;reign&rsquo;s side:<br />
      Two sought by force to seize his beauteous bride.&rdquo;<br />
      To whom the Sibyl thus: &ldquo;Compose thy mind;<br />
      Nor frauds are here contriv&rsquo;d, nor force design&rsquo;d.<br />
      Still may the dog the wand&rsquo;ring troops constrain<br />
      Of airy ghosts, and vex the guilty train,<br />
      And with her grisly lord his lovely queen remain.<br />
      The Trojan chief, whose lineage is from Jove,<br />
      Much fam&rsquo;d for arms, and more for filial love,<br />
      Is sent to seek his sire in your Elysian grove.<br />
      If neither piety, nor Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s command,<br />
      Can gain his passage to the Stygian strand,<br />
      This fatal present shall prevail at least.&rdquo;<br />
      Then shew&rsquo;d the shining bough, conceal&rsquo;d within her vest.<br />
      No more was needful: for the gloomy god<br />
      Stood mute with awe, to see the golden rod;<br />
      Admir&rsquo;d the destin&rsquo;d off&rsquo;ring to his queen;<br />
      A venerable gift, so rarely seen.<br />
      His fury thus appeas&rsquo;d, he puts to land;<br />
      The ghosts forsake their seats at his command:<br />
      He clears the deck, receives the mighty freight;<br />
      The leaky vessel groans beneath the weight.<br />
      Slowly she sails, and scarcely stems the tides;<br />
      The pressing water pours within her sides.<br />
      His passengers at length are wafted o&rsquo;er,<br />
      Expos&rsquo;d, in muddy weeds, upon the miry shore.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      No sooner landed, in his den they found<br />
      The triple porter of the Stygian sound,<br />
      Grim Cerberus, who soon began to rear<br />
      His crested snakes, and arm&rsquo;d his bristling hair.<br />
      The prudent Sibyl had before prepar&rsquo;d<br />
      A sop, in honey steep&rsquo;d, to charm the guard;<br />
      Which, mix&rsquo;d with pow&rsquo;rful drugs, she cast before<br />
      His greedy grinning jaws, just op&rsquo;d to roar.<br />
      With three enormous mouths he gapes; and straight,<br />
      With hunger press&rsquo;d, devours the pleasing bait.<br />
      Long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave;<br />
      He reels, and, falling, fills the spacious cave.<br />
      The keeper charm&rsquo;d, the chief without delay<br />
      Pass&rsquo;d on, and took th&rsquo; irremeable way.<br />
      Before the gates, the cries of babes new born,<br />
      Whom fate had from their tender mothers torn,<br />
      Assault his ears: then those, whom form of laws<br />
      Condemn&rsquo;d to die, when traitors judg&rsquo;d their cause.<br />
      Nor want they lots, nor judges to review<br />
      The wrongful sentence, and award a new.<br />
      Minos, the strict inquisitor, appears;<br />
      And lives and crimes, with his assessors, hears.<br />
      Round in his urn the blended balls he rolls,<br />
      Absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls.<br />
      The next, in place and punishment, are they<br />
      Who prodigally throw their souls away;<br />
      Fools, who, repining at their wretched state,<br />
      And loathing anxious life, suborn&rsquo;d their fate.<br />
      With late repentance now they would retrieve<br />
      The bodies they forsook, and wish to live;<br />
      Their pains and poverty desire to bear,<br />
      To view the light of heav&rsquo;n, and breathe the vital air:<br />
      But fate forbids; the Stygian floods oppose,<br />
      And with circling streams the captive souls inclose.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Not far from thence, the Mournful Fields appear<br />
      So call&rsquo;d from lovers that inhabit there.<br />
      The souls whom that unhappy flame invades,<br />
      In secret solitude and myrtle shades<br />
      Make endless moans, and, pining with desire,<br />
      Lament too late their unextinguish&rsquo;d fire.<br />
      Here Procris, Eriphyle here he found,<br />
      Baring her breast, yet bleeding with the wound<br />
      Made by her son. He saw Pasiphae there,<br />
      With Phaedra&rsquo;s ghost, a foul incestuous pair.<br />
      There Laodamia, with Evadne, moves,<br />
      Unhappy both, but loyal in their loves:<br />
      Caeneus, a woman once, and once a man,<br />
      But ending in the sex she first began.<br />
      Not far from these Phoenician Dido stood,<br />
      Fresh from her wound, her bosom bath&rsquo;d in blood;<br />
      Whom when the Trojan hero hardly knew,<br />
      Obscure in shades, and with a doubtful view,<br />
      (Doubtful as he who sees, thro&rsquo; dusky night,<br />
      Or thinks he sees, the moon&rsquo;s uncertain light,)<br />
      With tears he first approach&rsquo;d the sullen shade;<br />
      And, as his love inspir&rsquo;d him, thus he said:<br />
      &ldquo;Unhappy queen! then is the common breath<br />
      Of rumour true, in your reported death,<br />
      And I, alas! the cause? By Heav&rsquo;n, I vow,<br />
      And all the pow&rsquo;rs that rule the realms below,<br />
      Unwilling I forsook your friendly state,<br />
      Commanded by the gods, and forc&rsquo;d by fate.<br />
      Those gods, that fate, whose unresisted might<br />
      Have sent me to these regions void of light,<br />
      Thro&rsquo; the vast empire of eternal night.<br />
      Nor dar&rsquo;d I to presume, that, press&rsquo;d with grief,<br />
      My flight should urge you to this dire relief.<br />
      Stay, stay your steps, and listen to my vows:<br />
      &rsquo;Tis the last interview that fate allows!&rdquo;<br />
      In vain he thus attempts her mind to move<br />
      With tears, and pray&rsquo;rs, and late-repenting love.<br />
      Disdainfully she look&rsquo;d; then turning round,<br />
      But fix&rsquo;d her eyes unmov&rsquo;d upon the ground,<br />
      And what he says and swears, regards no more<br />
      Than the deaf rocks, when the loud billows roar;<br />
      But whirl&rsquo;d away, to shun his hateful sight,<br />
      Hid in the forest and the shades of night;<br />
      Then sought Sichaeus thro&rsquo; the shady grove,<br />
      Who answer&rsquo;d all her cares, and equal&rsquo;d all her love.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Some pious tears the pitying hero paid,<br />

      And, with his guide, the farther fields attain&rsquo;d,<br />
      Where, sever&rsquo;d from the rest, the warrior souls remain&rsquo;d.<br />
      Tydeus he met, with Meleager&rsquo;s race,<br />
      The pride of armies, and the soldiers&rsquo; grace;<br />

      All much lamented, all in battle slain;<br />
      Glaucus and Medon, high above the rest,<br />
      Antenor&rsquo;s sons, and Ceres&rsquo; sacred priest.<br />
      And proud Idaeus, Priam&rsquo;s charioteer,<br />
      Who shakes his empty reins, and aims his airy spear.<br />
      The gladsome ghosts, in circling troops, attend<br />
      And with unwearied eyes behold their friend;<br />
      Delight to hover near, and long to know<br />

      When his refulgent arms flash&rsquo;d thro&rsquo; the shady plain,<br />
      Fled from his well-known face, with wonted fear,<br />
      As when his thund&rsquo;ring sword and pointed spear<br />
      Drove headlong to their ships, and glean&rsquo;d the routed rear.<br />
      They rais&rsquo;d a feeble cry, with trembling notes;<br />
      But the weak voice deceiv&rsquo;d their gasping throats.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Here Priam&rsquo;s son, Deiphobus, he found,<br />
      Whose face and limbs were one continued wound:<br />
      Dishonest, with lopp&rsquo;d arms, the youth appears,<br />
      Spoil&rsquo;d of his nose, and shorten&rsquo;d of his ears.<br />
      He scarcely knew him, striving to disown<br />
      His blotted form, and blushing to be known;<br />
      And therefore first began: &ldquo;O Teucer&rsquo;s race,<br />
      Who durst thy faultless figure thus deface?<br />
      What heart could wish, what hand inflict, this dire disgrace?<br />
      &rsquo;Twas fam&rsquo;d, that in our last and fatal night<br />
      Your single prowess long sustain&rsquo;d the fight,<br />
      Till tir&rsquo;d, not forc&rsquo;d, a glorious fate you chose,<br />
      And fell upon a heap of slaughter&rsquo;d foes.<br />
      But, in remembrance of so brave a deed,<br />
      A tomb and fun&rsquo;ral honours I decreed;<br />
      Thrice call&rsquo;d your manes on the Trojan plains:<br />
      The place your armour and your name retains.<br />
      Your body too I sought, and, had I found,<br />
      Design&rsquo;d for burial in your native ground.&rdquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      The ghost replied: &ldquo;Your piety has paid<br />
      All needful rites, to rest my wand&rsquo;ring shade;<br />
      But cruel fate, and my more cruel wife,<br />
      To Grecian swords betray&rsquo;d my sleeping life.<br />
      These are the monuments of Helen&rsquo;s love:<br />
      The shame I bear below, the marks I bore above.<br />
      You know in what deluding joys we pass&rsquo;d<br />
      The night that was by Heav&rsquo;n decreed our last:<br />
      For, when the fatal horse, descending down,<br />
      Pregnant with arms, o&rsquo;erwhelm&rsquo;d th&rsquo; unhappy town<br />
      She feign&rsquo;d nocturnal orgies; left my bed,<br />
      And, mix&rsquo;d with Trojan dames, the dances led<br />
      Then, waving high her torch, the signal made,<br />
      Which rous&rsquo;d the Grecians from their ambuscade.<br />
      With watching overworn, with cares oppress&rsquo;d,<br />
      Unhappy I had laid me down to rest,<br />
      And heavy sleep my weary limbs possess&rsquo;d.<br />
      Meantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid,<br />
      And from beneath my head my sword convey&rsquo;d;<br />
      The door unlatch&rsquo;d, and, with repeated calls,<br />
      Invites her former lord within my walls.<br />
      Thus in her crime her confidence she plac&rsquo;d,<br />
      And with new treasons would redeem the past.<br />
      What need I more? Into the room they ran,<br />
      And meanly murder&rsquo;d a defenceless man.<br />
      Ulysses, basely born, first led the way.<br />
      Avenging pow&rsquo;rs! with justice if I pray,<br />
      That fortune be their own another day!<br />
      But answer you; and in your turn relate,<br />
      What brought you, living, to the Stygian state:<br />
      Driv&rsquo;n by the winds and errors of the sea,<br />
      Or did you Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s superior doom obey?<br />
      Or tell what other chance conducts your way,<br />

      While thus in talk the flying hours they pass,<br />

      The little time of stay which Heav&rsquo;n had lent;<br />
      But thus the Sibyl chides their long delay:<br />
      &ldquo;Night rushes down, and headlong drives the day:<br />

      To pay my penance till my years expire.<br />
      Proceed, auspicious prince, with glory crown&rsquo;d,<br />
      And born to better fates than I have found.&rdquo;<br />

      Whose fiery flood the burning empire bounds;<br />

      Observant of the souls that pass the downward way.<br />

      The Thracian bard, surrounded by the rest,<br />
      There stands conspicuous in his flowing vest;<br />
      His flying fingers, and harmonious quill,<br />
      Strikes sev&rsquo;n distinguish&rsquo;d notes, and sev&rsquo;n at once they fill.<br />
      Here found they Teucer&rsquo;s old heroic race,<br />
      Born better times and happier years to grace.<br />
      Assaracus and Ilus here enjoy<br />
      Perpetual fame, with him who founded Troy.<br />
      The chief beheld their chariots from afar,<br />
      Their shining arms, and coursers train&rsquo;d to war:<br />
      Their lances fix&rsquo;d in earth, their steeds around,<br />
      Free from their harness, graze the flow&rsquo;ry ground.<br />
      The love of horses which they had, alive,<br />
      And care of chariots, after death survive.<br />
      Some cheerful souls were feasting on the plain;<br />
      Some did the song, and some the choir maintain,<br />
      Beneath a laurel shade, where mighty Po<br />
      Mounts up to woods above, and hides his head below.<br />
      Here patriots live, who, for their country&rsquo;s good,<br />
      In fighting fields, were prodigal of blood:<br />
      Priests of unblemish&rsquo;d lives here make abode,<br />
      And poets worthy their inspiring god;<br />
      And searching wits, of more mechanic parts,<br />
      Who grac&rsquo;d their age with new-invented arts:<br />
      Those who to worth their bounty did extend,<br />
      And those who knew that bounty to commend.<br />
      The heads of these with holy fillets bound,<br />
      And all their temples were with garlands crown&rsquo;d.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      To these the Sibyl thus her speech address&rsquo;d,<br />
      And first to him surrounded by the rest<br />
      Tow&rsquo;ring his height, and ample was his breast;<br />
      &ldquo;Say, happy souls, divine Musaeus, say,<br />
      Where lives Anchises, and where lies our way<br />
      To find the hero, for whose only sake<br />
      We sought the dark abodes, and cross&rsquo;d the bitter lake?&rdquo;<br />
      To this the sacred poet thus replied:<br />
      &ldquo;In no fix&rsquo;d place the happy souls reside.<br />
      In groves we live, and lie on mossy beds,<br />
      By crystal streams, that murmur thro&rsquo; the meads:<br />
      But pass yon easy hill, and thence descend;<br />
      The path conducts you to your journey&rsquo;s end.&rdquo;<br />
      This said, he led them up the mountain&rsquo;s brow,<br />
      And shews them all the shining fields below.<br />
      They wind the hill, and thro&rsquo; the blissful meadows go.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      But old Anchises, in a flow&rsquo;ry vale,<br />
      Review&rsquo;d his muster&rsquo;d race, and took the tale:<br />
      Those happy spirits, which, ordain&rsquo;d by fate,<br />
      For future beings and new bodies wait.<br />
      With studious thought observ&rsquo;d th&rsquo; illustrious throng,<br />
      In nature&rsquo;s order as they pass&rsquo;d along:<br />
      Their names, their fates, their conduct, and their care,<br />
      In peaceful senates and successful war.<br />
      He, when Aeneas on the plain appears,<br />
      Meets him with open arms, and falling tears.<br />
      &ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the gods&rsquo; undoubted race!<br />
      O long expected to my dear embrace!<br />
      Once more &rsquo;tis giv&rsquo;n me to behold your face!<br />
      The love and pious duty which you pay<br />
      Have pass&rsquo;d the perils of so hard a way.<br />
      &rsquo;Tis true, computing times, I now believ&rsquo;d<br />
      The happy day approach&rsquo;d; nor are my hopes deceiv&rsquo;d.<br />
      What length of lands, what oceans have you pass&rsquo;d;<br />
      What storms sustain&rsquo;d, and on what shores been cast?<br />
      How have I fear&rsquo;d your fate! but fear&rsquo;d it most,<br />
      When love assail&rsquo;d you, on the Libyan coast.&rdquo;<br />
      To this, the filial duty thus replies:<br />
      &ldquo;Your sacred ghost before my sleeping eyes<br />
      Appear&rsquo;d, and often urg&rsquo;d this painful enterprise.<br />
      After long tossing on the Tyrrhene sea,<br />
      My navy rides at anchor in the bay.<br />
      But reach your hand, O parent shade, nor shun<br />
      The dear embraces of your longing son!&rdquo;<br />
      He said; and falling tears his face bedew:<br />
      Then thrice around his neck his arms he threw;<br />
      And thrice the flitting shadow slipp&rsquo;d away,<br />
      Like winds, or empty dreams that fly the day.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Now, in a secret vale, the Trojan sees<br />
      A sep&rsquo;rate grove, thro&rsquo; which a gentle breeze<br />
      Plays with a passing breath, and whispers thro&rsquo; the trees;<br />
      And, just before the confines of the wood,<br />
      The gliding Lethe leads her silent flood.<br />
      About the boughs an airy nation flew,<br />
      Thick as the humming bees, that hunt the golden dew;<br />
      In summer&rsquo;s heat on tops of lilies feed,<br />
      And creep within their bells, to suck the balmy seed:<br />
      The winged army roams the fields around;<br />
      The rivers and the rocks remurmur to the sound.<br />
      Aeneas wond&rsquo;ring stood, then ask&rsquo;d the cause<br />
      Which to the stream the crowding people draws.<br />
      Then thus the sire: &ldquo;The souls that throng the flood<br />
      Are those to whom, by fate, are other bodies ow&rsquo;d:<br />
      In Lethe&rsquo;s lake they long oblivion taste,<br />
      Of future life secure, forgetful of the past.<br />
      Long has my soul desir&rsquo;d this time and place,<br />
      To set before your sight your glorious race,<br />
      That this presaging joy may fire your mind<br />
      To seek the shores by destiny design&rsquo;d.&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;O father, can it be, that souls sublime<br />
      Return to visit our terrestrial clime,<br />
      And that the gen&rsquo;rous mind, releas&rsquo;d by death,<br />
      Can covet lazy limbs and mortal breath?&rdquo;<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Anchises then, in order, thus begun<br />
      To clear those wonders to his godlike son:<br />
      &ldquo;Know, first, that heav&rsquo;n, and earth&rsquo;s compacted frame,<br />
      And flowing waters, and the starry flame,<br />
      And both the radiant lights, one common soul<br />
      Inspires and feeds, and animates the whole.<br />
      This active mind, infus&rsquo;d thro&rsquo; all the space,<br />
      Unites and mingles with the mighty mass.<br />
      Hence men and beasts the breath of life obtain,<br />
      And birds of air, and monsters of the main.<br />
      Th&rsquo; ethereal vigour is in all the same,<br />
      And every soul is fill&rsquo;d with equal flame;<br />
      As much as earthy limbs, and gross allay<br />
      Of mortal members, subject to decay,<br />
      Blunt not the beams of heav&rsquo;n and edge of day.<br />
      From this coarse mixture of terrestrial parts,<br />
      Desire and fear by turns possess their hearts,<br />
      And grief, and joy; nor can the groveling mind,<br />
      In the dark dungeon of the limbs confin&rsquo;d,<br />
      Assert the native skies, or own its heav&rsquo;nly kind:<br />
      Nor death itself can wholly wash their stains;<br />
      But long-contracted filth ev&rsquo;n in the soul remains.<br />
      The relics of inveterate vice they wear,<br />
      And spots of sin obscene in ev&rsquo;ry face appear.<br />
      For this are various penances enjoin&rsquo;d;<br />
      And some are hung to bleach upon the wind,<br />
      Some plung&rsquo;d in waters, others purg&rsquo;d in fires,<br />
      Till all the dregs are drain&rsquo;d, and all the rust expires.<br />
      All have their manes, and those manes bear:<br />
      The few, so cleans&rsquo;d, to these abodes repair,<br />
      And breathe, in ample fields, the soft Elysian air.<br />
      Then are they happy, when by length of time<br />
      The scurf is worn away of each committed crime;<br />
      No speck is left of their habitual stains,<br />
      But the pure ether of the soul remains.<br />
      But, when a thousand rolling years are past,<br />
      (So long their punishments and penance last,)<br />
      Whole droves of minds are, by the driving god,<br />
      Compell&rsquo;d to drink the deep Lethaean flood,<br />
      In large forgetful draughts to steep the cares<br />
      Of their past labours, and their irksome years,<br />
      That, unrememb&rsquo;ring of its former pain,<br />
      The soul may suffer mortal flesh again.&rdquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Thus having said, the father spirit leads<br />
      The priestess and his son thro&rsquo; swarms of shades,<br />

      Observe the youth who first appears in sight,<br />
      And holds the nearest station to the light,<br />
      Already seems to snuff the vital air,<br />
      And leans just forward, on a shining spear:<br />
      Silvius is he, thy last-begotten race,<br />
      But first in order sent, to fill thy place;<br />
      An Alban name, but mix&rsquo;d with Dardan blood,<br />
      Born in the covert of a shady wood:<br />
      Him fair Lavinia, thy surviving wife,<br />
      Shall breed in groves, to lead a solitary life.<br />

      And, born a king, a race of kings beget.<br />
      Then Procas, honour of the Trojan name,<br />
      Capys, and Numitor, of endless fame.<br />
      A second Silvius after these appears;<br />
      Silvius Aeneas, for thy name he bears;<br />
      For arms and justice equally renown&rsquo;d,<br />
      Who, late restor&rsquo;d, in Alba shall be crown&rsquo;d.<br />
      How great they look! how vig&rsquo;rously they wield<br />
      Their weighty lances, and sustain the shield!<br />
      But they, who crown&rsquo;d with oaken wreaths appear,<br />
      Shall Gabian walls and strong Fidena rear;<br />
      Nomentum, Bola, with Pometia, found;<br />
      And raise Collatian tow&rsquo;rs on rocky ground.<br />
      All these shall then be towns of mighty fame,<br />
      Tho&rsquo; now they lie obscure, and lands without a name.<br />
      See Romulus the great, born to restore<br />
      The crown that once his injur&rsquo;d grandsire wore.<br />
      This prince a priestess of your blood shall bear,<br />
      And like his sire in arms he shall appear.<br />
      Two rising crests, his royal head adorn;<br />
      Born from a god, himself to godhead born:<br />
      His sire already signs him for the skies,<br />
      And marks the seat amidst the deities.<br />
      Auspicious chief! thy race, in times to come,<br />
      Shall spread the conquests of imperial Rome.<br />
      Rome, whose ascending tow&rsquo;rs shall heav&rsquo;n invade,<br />
      Involving earth and ocean in her shade;<br />
      High as the Mother of the Gods in place,<br />
      And proud, like her, of an immortal race.<br />

      His head with olive crown&rsquo;d, his hand a censer bears,<br />
      His hoary beard and holy vestments bring<br />
      His lost idea back: I know the Roman king.<br />

      Call&rsquo;d from his mean abode a scepter to sustain.<br />
      Him Tullus next in dignity succeeds,<br />
      An active prince, and prone to martial deeds.<br />
      He shall his troops for fighting fields prepare,<br />
      Disus&rsquo;d to toils, and triumphs of the war.<br />
      By dint of sword his crown he shall increase,<br />
      And scour his armour from the rust of peace.<br />

      Of nature, pleading in his children&rsquo;s cause!<br />
      Howe&rsquo;er the doubtful fact is understood,<br />
      &rsquo;Tis love of honour, and his country&rsquo;s good:<br />

      To rule mankind, and make the world obey,<br />
      Disposing peace and war by thy own majestic way;<br />
      To tame the proud, the fetter&rsquo;d slave to free:<br />

    <h5> THE ARGUMENT. </h5>

    <p>
      King Latinus entertains Aeneas, and promises him his only daughter, Lavinia,
      the heiress of his crown. Turnus, being in love with her, favoured by her mother,
      and by Juno and Alecto, breaks the treaty which was made, and engages in his
      quarrel Mezentius, Camilla, Messapus, and many other of the neighbouring princes;
      whose forces, and the names of their commanders are particularly related.

      Now, when the prince her fun&rsquo;ral rites had paid,<br />
      He plow&rsquo;d the Tyrrhene seas with sails display&rsquo;d.<br />
      From land a gentle breeze arose by night,<br />
      Serenely shone the stars, the moon was bright,<br />
      And the sea trembled with her silver light.<br />
      Now near the shelves of Circe&rsquo;s shores they run,<br />
      (Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun,)<br />

      In joyous songs; the rocks resound her lays:<br />
      In spinning, or the loom, she spends the night,<br />
      And cedar brands supply her father&rsquo;s light.<br />
      From hence were heard, rebellowing to the main,<br />
      The roars of lions that refuse the chain,<br />
      The grunts of bristled boars, and groans of bears,<br />
      And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors&rsquo; ears.<br />
      These from their caverns, at the close of night,<br />
      Fill the sad isle with horror and affright.<br />
      Darkling they mourn their fate, whom Circe&rsquo;s pow&rsquo;r,<br />

      With words and wicked herbs from humankind<br />

      Propitious Neptune steer&rsquo;d their course by night<br />
      With rising gales that sped their happy flight.<br />
      Supplied with these, they skim the sounding shore,<br />
      And hear the swelling surges vainly roar.<br />
      Now, when the rosy morn began to rise,<br />
      And wav&rsquo;d her saffron streamer thro&rsquo; the skies;<br />
      When Thetis blush&rsquo;d in purple not her own,<br />
      And from her face the breathing winds were blown,<br />
      A sudden silence sate upon the sea,<br />
      And sweeping oars, with struggling, urge their way.<br />
      The Trojan, from the main, beheld a wood,<br />
      Which thick with shades and a brown horror stood:<br />
      Betwixt the trees the Tiber took his course,<br />
      With whirlpools dimpled; and with downward force,<br />
      That drove the sand along, he took his way,<br />
      And roll&rsquo;d his yellow billows to the sea.<br />
      About him, and above, and round the wood,<br />
      The birds that haunt the borders of his flood,<br />
      That bath&rsquo;d within, or basked upon his side,<br />
      To tuneful songs their narrow throats applied.<br />

      Latinus, old and mild, had long possess&rsquo;d<br />
      The Latin scepter, and his people blest:<br />
      His father Faunus; a Laurentian dame<br />
      His mother; fair Marica was her name.<br />
      But Faunus came from Picus: Picus drew<br />
      His birth from Saturn, if records be true.<br />
      Thus King Latinus, in the third degree,<br />
      Had Saturn author of his family.<br />
      But this old peaceful prince, as Heav&rsquo;n decreed,<br />

      One only daughter heir&rsquo;d the royal state.<br />

      Young Turnus to the beauteous maid address&rsquo;d.<br />

      This plant Latinus, when his town he wall&rsquo;d,<br />

      A swarm of bees, that cut the liquid sky,<br />

      Upon the topmost branch in clouds alight;<br />
      There with their clasping feet together clung,<br />

      This was that famine, this the fatal place<br />
      Which ends the wand&rsquo;ring of our exil&rsquo;d race.<br />
      Then, on tomorrow&rsquo;s dawn, your care employ,<br />
      To search the land, and where the cities lie,<br />
      And what the men; but give this day to joy.<br />
      Now pour to Jove; and, after Jove is blest,<br />
      Call great Anchises to the genial feast:<br />

      He said, and then on each bestow&rsquo;d a steed.<br />
      Three hundred horses, in high stables fed,<br />

      The steeds caparison&rsquo;d with purple stand,<br />

      But jealous Juno, from Pachynus&rsquo; height,<br />
      As she from Argos took her airy flight,<br />
      Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight.<br />
      She saw the Trojan and his joyful train<br />
      Descend upon the shore, desert the main,<br />
      Design a town, and, with unhop&rsquo;d success,<br />
      Th&rsquo; embassadors return with promis&rsquo;d peace.<br />
      Then, pierc&rsquo;d with pain, she shook her haughty head,<br />
      Sigh&rsquo;d from her inward soul, and thus she said:<br />
      &ldquo;O hated offspring of my Phrygian foes!<br />
      O fates of Troy, which Juno&rsquo;s fates oppose!<br />
      Could they not fall unpitied on the plain,<br />
      But slain revive, and, taken, scape again?<br />
      When execrable Troy in ashes lay,<br />
      Thro&rsquo; fires and swords and seas they forc&rsquo;d their way.<br />
      Then vanquish&rsquo;d Juno must in vain contend,<br />
      Her rage disarm&rsquo;d, her empire at an end.<br />
      Breathless and tir&rsquo;d, is all my fury spent?<br />
      Or does my glutted spleen at length relent?<br />
      As if &rsquo;twere little from their town to chase,<br />
      I thro&rsquo; the seas pursued their exil&rsquo;d race;<br />
      Ingag&rsquo;d the heav&rsquo;ns, oppos&rsquo;d the stormy main;<br />
      But billows roar&rsquo;d, and tempests rag&rsquo;d in vain.<br />
      What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done,<br />
      When these they overpass, and those they shun?<br />
      On Tiber&rsquo;s shores they land, secure of fate,<br />
      Triumphant o&rsquo;er the storms and Juno&rsquo;s hate.<br />
      Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe,<br />
      And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia&rsquo;s wrath,<br />
      Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon;<br />
      What great offence had either people done?<br />
      But I, the consort of the Thunderer,<br />
      Have wag&rsquo;d a long and unsuccessful war,<br />
      With various arts and arms in vain have toil&rsquo;d,<br />
      And by a mortal man at length am foil&rsquo;d.<br />
      If native pow&rsquo;r prevail not, shall I doubt<br />
      To seek for needful succour from without?<br />
      If Jove and Heav&rsquo;n my just desires deny,<br />
      Hell shall the pow&rsquo;r of Heav&rsquo;n and Jove supply.<br />
      Grant that the Fates have firm&rsquo;d, by their decree,<br />
      The Trojan race to reign in Italy;<br />
      At least I can defer the nuptial day,<br />
      And with protracted wars the peace delay:<br />
      With blood the dear alliance shall be bought,<br />
      And both the people near destruction brought;<br />
      So shall the son-in-law and father join,<br />
      With ruin, war, and waste of either line.<br />
      O fatal maid, thy marriage is endow&rsquo;d<br />
      With Phrygian, Latian, and Rutulian blood!<br />
      Bellona leads thee to thy lover&rsquo;s hand;<br />
      Another queen brings forth another brand,<br />
      To burn with foreign fires another land!<br />
      A second Paris, diff&rsquo;ring but in name,<br />

      Smear&rsquo;d as she was with black Gorgonian blood,<br />
      The Fury sprang above the Stygian flood;<br />
      And on her wicker wings, sublime thro&rsquo; night,<br />
      She to the Latian palace took her flight:<br />
      There sought the queen&rsquo;s apartment, stood before<br />
      The peaceful threshold, and besieg&rsquo;d the door.<br />
      Restless Amata lay, her swelling breast<br />
      Fir&rsquo;d with disdain for Turnus dispossess&rsquo;d,<br />
      And the new nuptials of the Trojan guest.<br />
      From her black bloody locks the Fury shakes<br />
      Her darling plague, the fav&rsquo;rite of her snakes;<br />
      With her full force she threw the poisonous dart,<br />
      And fix&rsquo;d it deep within Amata&rsquo;s heart,<br />
      That, thus envenom&rsquo;d, she might kindle rage,<br />
      And sacrifice to strife her house and husband&rsquo;s age.<br />
      Unseen, unfelt, the fiery serpent skims<br />
      Betwixt her linen and her naked limbs;<br />
      His baleful breath inspiring, as he glides,<br />
      Now like a chain around her neck he rides,<br />
      Now like a fillet to her head repairs,<br />
      And with his circling volumes folds her hairs.<br />
      At first the silent venom slid with ease,<br />
      And seiz&rsquo;d her cooler senses by degrees;<br />
      Then, ere th&rsquo; infected mass was fir&rsquo;d too far,<br />
      In plaintive accents she began the war,<br />
      And thus bespoke her husband: &ldquo;Shall,&rdquo; she said,<br />
      &ldquo;A wand&rsquo;ring prince enjoy Lavinia&rsquo;s bed?<br />
      If nature plead not in a parent&rsquo;s heart,<br />

      I know, my dearest lord, the time will come,<br />
      You&rsquo;d in vain, reverse your cruel doom;<br />
      The faithless pirate soon will set to sea,<br />
      And bear the royal virgin far away!<br />
      A guest like him, a Trojan guest before,<br />

      To this false foreigner you give your throne,<br />
      And wrong a friend, a kinsman, and a son.<br />
      Resume your ancient care; and, if the god<br />
      Your sire, and you, resolve on foreign blood,<br />
      Know all are foreign, in a larger sense,<br />
      Not born your subjects, or deriv&rsquo;d from hence.<br />

      Her vital parts, and poison&rsquo;d all her breast;<br />
      She raves, she runs with a distracted pace,<br />
      And fills with horrid howls the public place.<br />
      And, as young striplings whip the top for sport,<br />
      On the smooth pavement of an empty court;<br />
      The wooden engine flies and whirls about,<br />
      Admir&rsquo;d, with clamours, of the beardless rout;<br />

      Amidst the crowd, and kindles as she goes.<br />
      Nor yet content, she strains her malice more,<br />
      And adds new ills to those contriv&rsquo;d before:<br />
      She flies the town, and, mixing with a throng<br />
      Of madding matrons, bears the bride along,<br />
      Wand&rsquo;ring thro&rsquo; woods and wilds, and devious ways,<br />
      And with these arts the Trojan match delays.<br />
      She feign&rsquo;d the rites of Bacchus; cried aloud,<br />
      And to the buxom god the virgin vow&rsquo;d.<br />
      &ldquo;Evoe! O Bacchus!&rdquo; thus began the song;<br />

      &ldquo;O worthy thee alone!&rdquo; the crew replied.<br />
      &ldquo;For thee she feeds her hair, she leads thy dance,<br />
      And with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance.&rdquo;<br />
      Like fury seiz&rsquo;d the rest; the progress known,<br />
      All seek the mountains, and forsake the town:<br />
      All, clad in skins of beasts, the jav&rsquo;lin bear,<br />
      Give to the wanton winds their flowing hair,<br />
      And shrieks and shoutings rend the suff&rsquo;ring air.<br />
      The queen herself, inspir&rsquo;d with rage divine,<br />
      Shook high above her head a flaming pine;<br />
      Then roll&rsquo;d her haggard eyes around the throng,<br />
      And sung, in Turnus&rsquo; name, the nuptial song:<br />
      &ldquo;Io, ye Latian dames! if any here<br />
      Hold your unhappy queen, Amata, dear;<br />
      If there be here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;who dare maintain<br />

      Amata&rsquo;s breast the Fury thus invades,<br />
      And fires with rage, amid the sylvan shades;<br />
      Then, when she found her venom spread so far,<br />
      The royal house embroil&rsquo;d in civil war,<br />
      Rais&rsquo;d on her dusky wings, she cleaves the skies,<br />
      And seeks the palace where young Turnus lies.<br />
      His town, as fame reports, was built of old<br />
      By Danae, pregnant with almighty gold,<br />
      Who fled her father&rsquo;s rage, and, with a train<br />
      Of following Argives, thro&rsquo; the stormy main,<br />
      Driv&rsquo;n by the southern blasts, was fated here to reign.<br />
      &rsquo;Twas Ardua once; now Ardea&rsquo;s name it bears;<br />
      Once a fair city, now consum&rsquo;d with years.<br />
      Here, in his lofty palace, Turnus lay,<br />
      Betwixt the confines of the night and day,<br />
      Secure in sleep. The Fury laid aside<br />
      Her looks and limbs, and with new methods tried<br />
      The foulness of th&rsquo; infernal form to hide.<br />
      Propp&rsquo;d on a staff, she takes a trembling mien:<br />
      Her face is furrow&rsquo;d, and her front obscene;<br />
      Deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws;<br />
      Sunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws;<br />
      Her hoary hair with holy fillets bound,<br />
      Her temples with an olive wreath are crown&rsquo;d.<br />
      Old Chalybe, who kept the sacred fane<br />
      Of Juno, now she seem&rsquo;d, and thus began,<br />
      Appearing in a dream, to rouse the careless man:<br />
      &ldquo;Shall Turnus then such endless toil sustain<br />
      In fighting fields, and conquer towns in vain?<br />
      Win, for a Trojan head to wear the prize,<br />
      Usurp thy crown, enjoy thy victories?<br />
      The bride and scepter which thy blood has bought,<br />
      The king transfers; and foreign heirs are sought.<br />
      Go now, deluded man, and seek again<br />
      New toils, new dangers, on the dusty plain.<br />
      Repel the Tuscan foes; their city seize;<br />
      Protect the Latians in luxurious ease.<br />
      This dream all-pow&rsquo;rful Juno sends; I bear<br />
      Her mighty mandates, and her words you hear.<br />
      Haste; arm your Ardeans; issue to the plain;<br />
      With fate to friend, assault the Trojan train:<br />
      Their thoughtless chiefs, their painted ships, that lie<br />
      In Tiber&rsquo;s mouth, with fire and sword destroy.<br />
      The Latian king, unless he shall submit,<br />
      Own his old promise, and his new forget;<br />
      Let him, in arms, the pow&rsquo;r of Turnus prove,<br />
      And learn to fear whom he disdains to love.<br />
      For such is Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s command.&rdquo; The youthful prince<br />
      With scorn replied, and made this bold defence:<br />
      &ldquo;You tell me, mother, what I knew before:<br />
      The Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore.<br />
      I neither fear nor will provoke the war;<br />
      My fate is Juno&rsquo;s most peculiar care.<br />
      But time has made you dote, and vainly tell<br />
      Of arms imagin&rsquo;d in your lonely cell.<br />
      Go; be the temple and the gods your care;<br />
      Permit to men the thought of peace and war.&rdquo;<br />

      These haughty words Alecto&rsquo;s rage provoke,<br />

      Her hideous looks and hellish form return;<br />
      Her curling snakes with hissings fill the place,<br />

      Then, darting fire from her malignant eyes,<br />

      High on her head she rears two twisted snakes,<br />
      Her chains she rattles, and her whip she shakes;<br />
      And, churning bloody foam, thus loudly speaks:<br />
      &ldquo;Behold whom time has made to dote, and tell<br />
      Of arms imagin&rsquo;d in her lonely cell!<br />

      A good old man, while peace he preach&rsquo;d in vain,<br />
      Amidst the madness of th&rsquo; unruly train:<br />

      Thus, while in equal scales their fortune stood<br />

      And bears fulfill&rsquo;d her promise to the skies.<br />
      To Juno thus she speaks: &ldquo;Behold! It is done,<br />
      The blood already drawn, the war begun;<br />
      The discord is complete; nor can they cease<br />
      The dire debate, nor you command the peace.<br />

      Speak, and my pow&rsquo;r shall add this office more:<br />
      The neighbr&rsquo;ing nations of th&rsquo; Ausonian shore<br />
      Shall hear the dreadful rumour, from afar,<br />
      Of arm&rsquo;d invasion, and embrace the war.&rdquo;<br />
      Then Juno thus: &ldquo;The grateful work is done,<br />
      The seeds of discord sow&rsquo;d, the war begun;<br />
      Frauds, fears, and fury have possess&rsquo;d the state,<br />
      And fix&rsquo;d the causes of a lasting hate.<br />
      A bloody Hymen shall th&rsquo; alliance join<br />
      Betwixt the Trojan and Ausonian line:<br />
      But thou with speed to night and hell repair;<br />
      For not the gods, nor angry Jove, will bear<br />
      Thy lawless wand&rsquo;ring walks in upper air.<br />
      Leave what remains to me.&rdquo; Saturnia said:<br />
      The sullen fiend her sounding wings display&rsquo;d,<br />
      Unwilling left the light, and sought the nether shade.<br />

      In midst of Italy, well known to fame,<br />

      Below the lofty mounts: on either side<br />
      Thick forests the forbidden entrance hide.<br />
      Full in the centre of the sacred wood<br />
      An arm arises of the Stygian flood,<br />
      Which, breaking from beneath with bellowing sound,<br />
      Whirls the black waves and rattling stones around.<br />
      Here Pluto pants for breath from out his cell,<br />
      And opens wide the grinning jaws of hell.<br />
      To this infernal lake the Fury flies;<br />

      Saturnian Juno now, with double care,<br />

      Ambitious Turnus in the press appears,<br />

      Against the public sanctions of the peace,<br />
      Against all omens of their ill success.<br />

      But, like a rock unmov&rsquo;d, a rock that braves<br />
      The raging tempest and the rising waves,<br />
      Propp&rsquo;d on himself he stands; his solid sides<br />
      Wash off the seaweeds, and the sounding tides:<br />
      So stood the pious prince, unmov&rsquo;d, and long<br />
      Sustain&rsquo;d the madness of the noisy throng.<br />
      But, when he found that Juno&rsquo;s pow&rsquo;r prevail&rsquo;d,<br />
      And all the methods of cool counsel fail&rsquo;d,<br />
      He calls the gods to witness their offence,<br />
      Disclaims the war, asserts his innocence.<br />
      &ldquo;Hurried by fate,&rdquo; he cries, &ldquo;and borne before<br />
      A furious wind, we have the faithful shore.<br />
      O more than madmen! you yourselves shall bear<br />
      The guilt of blood and sacrilegious war:<br />
      Thou, Turnus, shalt atone it by thy fate,<br />
      And pray to Heav&rsquo;n for peace, but pray too late.<br />
      For me, my stormy voyage at an end,<br />
      I to the port of death securely tend.<br />
      The fun&rsquo;ral pomp which to your kings you pay,<br />
      Is all I want, and all you take away.&rdquo;<br />
      He said no more, but, in his walls confin&rsquo;d,<br />
      Shut out the woes which he too well divin&rsquo;d<br />
      Nor with the rising storm would vainly strive,<br />
      But left the helm, and let the vessel drive.<br />

      But hid his head, and, safe from loud alarms,<br />
      Abhorr&rsquo;d the wicked ministry of arms.<br />

    <h5> THE ARGUMENT. </h5>

    <p>
      The war being now begun, both the generals make all possible preparations.
      Turnus sends to Diomedes. Aeneas goes in person to beg succours from Evander
      and the Tuscans. Evander receives him kindly, furnishes him with men, and
      sends his son Pallas with him. Vulcan, at the request of Venus, makes arms
      for her son Aeneas, and draws on his shield the most memorable actions of
      his posterity.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Turnus had assembled all his pow&rsquo;rs,<br />
      His standard planted on Laurentum&rsquo;s tow&rsquo;rs;<br />
      When now the sprightly trumpet, from afar,<br />
      Had giv&rsquo;n the signal of approaching war,<br />
      Had rous&rsquo;d the neighing steeds to scour the fields,<br />
      While the fierce riders clatter&rsquo;d on their shields;<br />
      Trembling with rage, the Latian youth prepare<br />
      To join th&rsquo; allies, and headlong rush to war.<br />
      Fierce Ufens, and Messapus, led the crowd,<br />
      With bold Mezentius, who blasphem&rsquo;d aloud.<br />
      These thro&rsquo; the country took their wasteful course,<br />
      The fields to forage, and to gather force.<br />
      Then Venulus to Diomede they send,<br />
      To beg his aid Ausonia to defend,<br />
      Declare the common danger, and inform<br />
      The Grecian leader of the growing storm:<br />
      &ldquo;Aeneas, landed on the Latian coast,<br />
      With banish&rsquo;d gods, and with a baffled host,<br />
      Yet now aspir&rsquo;d to conquest of the state,<br />
      And claim&rsquo;d a title from the gods and fate;<br />
      What num&rsquo;rous nations in his quarrel came,<br />
      And how they spread his formidable name.<br />
      What he design&rsquo;d, what mischief might arise,<br />
      If fortune favour&rsquo;d his first enterprise,<br />
      Was left for him to weigh, whose equal fears,<br />
      And common interest, was involv&rsquo;d in theirs.&rdquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      While Turnus and th&rsquo; allies thus urge the war,<br />
      The Trojan, floating in a flood of care,<br />
      Beholds the tempest which his foes prepare.<br />
      This way and that he turns his anxious mind;<br />
      Thinks, and rejects the counsels he design&rsquo;d;<br />
      Explores himself in vain, in ev&rsquo;ry part,<br />
      And gives no rest to his distracted heart.<br />
      So, when the sun by day, or moon by night,<br />
      Strike on the polish&rsquo;d brass their trembling light,<br />
      The glitt&rsquo;ring species here and there divide,<br />
      And cast their dubious beams from side to side;<br />
      Now on the walls, now on the pavement play,<br />
      And to the ceiling flash the glaring day.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &rsquo;Twas night; and weary nature lull&rsquo;d asleep<br />
      The birds of air, and fishes of the deep,<br />
      And beasts, and mortal men. The Trojan chief<br />
      Was laid on Tiber&rsquo;s banks, oppress&rsquo;d with grief,<br />
      And found in silent slumber late relief.<br />
      Then, thro&rsquo; the shadows of the poplar wood,<br />
      Arose the father of the Roman flood;<br />
      An azure robe was o&rsquo;er his body spread,<br />
      A wreath of shady reeds adorn&rsquo;d his head:<br />
      Thus, manifest to sight, the god appear&rsquo;d,<br />
      And with these pleasing words his sorrow cheer&rsquo;d:<br />
      &ldquo;Undoubted offspring of ethereal race,<br />
      O long expected in this promis&rsquo;d place!<br />
      Who thro&rsquo; the foes hast borne thy banish&rsquo;d gods,<br />
      Restor&rsquo;d them to their hearths, and old abodes;<br />
      This is thy happy home, the clime where fate<br />
      Ordains thee to restore the Trojan state.<br />
      Fear not! The war shall end in lasting peace,<br />
      And all the rage of haughty Juno cease.<br />
      And that this nightly vision may not seem<br />
      Th&rsquo; effect of fancy, or an idle dream,<br />
      A sow beneath an oak shall lie along,<br />
      All white herself, and white her thirty young.<br />
      When thirty rolling years have run their race,<br />
      Thy son Ascanius, on this empty space,<br />
      Shall build a royal town, of lasting fame,<br />
      Which from this omen shall receive the name.<br />
      Time shall approve the truth. For what remains,<br />
      And how with sure success to crown thy pains,<br />
      With patience next attend. A banish&rsquo;d band,<br />
      Driv&rsquo;n with Evander from th&rsquo; Arcadian land,<br />
      Have planted here, and plac&rsquo;d on high their walls;<br />
      Their town the founder Pallanteum calls,<br />
      Deriv&rsquo;d from Pallas, his great-grandsire&rsquo;s name:<br />
      But the fierce Latians old possession claim,<br />
      With war infesting the new colony.<br />
      These make thy friends, and on their aid rely.<br />
      To thy free passage I submit my streams.<br />
      Wake, son of Venus, from thy pleasing dreams;<br />
      And, when the setting stars are lost in day,<br />
      To Juno&rsquo;s pow&rsquo;r thy just devotion pay;<br />
      With sacrifice the wrathful queen appease:<br />
      Her pride at length shall fall, her fury cease.<br />
      When thou return&rsquo;st victorious from the war,<br />
      Perform thy vows to me with grateful care.<br />
      The god am I, whose yellow water flows<br />
      Around these fields, and fattens as it goes:<br />
      Tiber my name; among the rolling floods<br />
      Renown&rsquo;d on earth, esteem&rsquo;d among the gods.<br />
      This is my certain seat. In times to come,<br />
      My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome.&rdquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      He said, and plung&rsquo;d below. While yet he spoke,<br />
      His dream Aeneas and his sleep forsook.<br />
      He rose, and looking up, beheld the skies<br />
      With purple blushing, and the day arise.<br />
      Then water in his hollow palm he took<br />
      From Tiber&rsquo;s flood, and thus the pow&rsquo;rs bespoke:<br />
      &ldquo;Laurentian nymphs, by whom the streams are fed,<br />
      And Father Tiber, in thy sacred bed<br />
      Receive Aeneas, and from danger keep.<br />
      Whatever fount, whatever holy deep,<br />
      Conceals thy wat&rsquo;ry stores; where&rsquo;er they rise,<br />
      And, bubbling from below, salute the skies;<br />
      Thou, king of horned floods, whose plenteous urn<br />
      Suffices fatness to the fruitful corn,<br />
      For this thy kind compassion of our woes,<br />
      Shalt share my morning song and ev&rsquo;ning vows.<br />
      But, O be present to thy people&rsquo;s aid,<br />
      And firm the gracious promise thou hast made!&rdquo;<br />
      Thus having said, two galleys from his stores,<br />
      With care he chooses, mans, and fits with oars.<br />
      Now on the shore the fatal swine is found.<br />
      Wond&rsquo;rous to tell!&mdash;She lay along the ground:<br />
      Her well-fed offspring at her udders hung;<br />
      She white herself, and white her thirty young.<br />
      Aeneas takes the mother and her brood,<br />
      And all on Juno&rsquo;s altar are bestow&rsquo;d.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      The foll&rsquo;wing night, and the succeeding day,<br />
      Propitious Tiber smooth&rsquo;d his wat&rsquo;ry way:<br />
      He roll&rsquo;d his river back, and pois&rsquo;d he stood,<br />
      A gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood.<br />
      The Trojans mount their ships; they put from shore,<br />
      Borne on the waves, and scarcely dip an oar.<br />
      Shouts from the land give omen to their course,<br />
      And the pitch&rsquo;d vessels glide with easy force.<br />
      The woods and waters wonder at the gleam<br />
      Of shields, and painted ships that stem the stream.<br />
      One summer&rsquo;s night and one whole day they pass<br />
      Betwixt the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass.<br />
      The fiery sun had finish&rsquo;d half his race,<br />
      Look&rsquo;d back, and doubted in the middle space,<br />
      When they from far beheld the rising tow&rsquo;rs,<br />
      The tops of sheds, and shepherds&rsquo; lowly bow&rsquo;rs,<br />
      Thin as they stood, which, then of homely clay,<br />
      Now rise in marble, from the Roman sway.<br />
      These cots (Evander&rsquo;s kingdom, mean and poor)<br />
      The Trojan saw, and turn&rsquo;d his ships to shore.<br />
      &rsquo;Twas on a solemn day: th&rsquo; Arcadian states,<br />
      The king and prince, without the city gates,<br />
      Then paid their off&rsquo;rings in a sacred grove<br />
      To Hercules, the warrior son of Jove.<br />
      Thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies,<br />
      And fat of entrails on his altar fries.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      But, when they saw the ships that stemm&rsquo;d the flood,<br />
      And glitter&rsquo;d thro&rsquo; the covert of the wood,<br />
      They rose with fear, and left th&rsquo; unfinish&rsquo;d feast,<br />
      Till dauntless Pallas reassur&rsquo;d the rest<br />
      To pay the rites. Himself without delay<br />
      A jav&rsquo;lin seiz&rsquo;d, and singly took his way;<br />
      Then gain&rsquo;d a rising ground, and call&rsquo;d from far:<br />
      &ldquo;Resolve me, strangers, whence, and what you are;<br />
      Your bus&rsquo;ness here; and bring you peace or war?&rdquo;<br />
      High on the stern Aeneas took his stand,<br />
      And held a branch of olive in his hand,<br />
      While thus he spoke: &ldquo;The Phrygians&rsquo; arms you see,<br />
      Expell&rsquo;d from Troy, provok&rsquo;d in Italy<br />
      By Latian foes, with war unjustly made;<br />
      At first affianc&rsquo;d, and at last betray&rsquo;d.<br />
      This message bear: &lsquo;The Trojans and their chief<br />
      Bring holy peace, and beg the king&rsquo;s relief.&rsquo;<br />
      Struck with so great a name, and all on fire,<br />
      The youth replies: &ldquo;Whatever you require,<br />
      Your fame exacts. Upon our shores descend.<br />
      A welcome guest, and, what you wish, a friend.&rdquo;<br />
      He said, and, downward hasting to the strand,<br />
      Embrac&rsquo;d the stranger prince, and join&rsquo;d his hand.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Conducted to the grove, Aeneas broke<br />
      The silence first, and thus the king bespoke:<br />
      &ldquo;Best of the Greeks, to whom, by fate&rsquo;s command,<br />
      I bear these peaceful branches in my hand,<br />
      Undaunted I approach you, tho&rsquo; I know<br />
      Your birth is Grecian, and your land my foe;<br />
      From Atreus tho&rsquo; your ancient lineage came,<br />
      And both the brother kings your kindred claim;<br />
      Yet, my self-conscious worth, your high renown,<br />
      Your virtue, thro&rsquo; the neighb&rsquo;ring nations blown,<br />
      Our fathers&rsquo; mingled blood, Apollo&rsquo;s voice,<br />
      Have led me hither, less by need than choice.<br />
      Our founder Dardanus, as fame has sung,<br />
      And Greeks acknowledge, from Electra sprung:<br />
      Electra from the loins of Atlas came;<br />
      Atlas, whose head sustains the starry frame.<br />
      Your sire is Mercury, whom long before<br />
      On cold Cyllene&rsquo;s top fair Maia bore.<br />
      Maia the fair, on fame if we rely,<br />
      Was Atlas&rsquo; daughter, who sustains the sky.<br />
      Thus from one common source our streams divide;<br />
      Ours is the Trojan, yours th&rsquo; Arcadian side.<br />
      Rais&rsquo;d by these hopes, I sent no news before,<br />
      Nor ask&rsquo;d your leave, nor did your faith implore;<br />
      But come, without a pledge, my own ambassador.<br />
      The same Rutulians, who with arms pursue<br />
      The Trojan race, are equal foes to you.<br />
      Our host expell&rsquo;d, what farther force can stay<br />
      The victor troops from universal sway?<br />
      Then will they stretch their pow&rsquo;r athwart the land,<br />
      And either sea from side to side command.<br />
      Receive our offer&rsquo;d faith, and give us thine;<br />
      Ours is a gen&rsquo;rous and experienc&rsquo;d line:<br />
      We want not hearts nor bodies for the war;<br />
      In council cautious, and in fields we dare.&rdquo;<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      He said; and while spoke, with piercing eyes<br />
      Evander view&rsquo;d the man with vast surprise,<br />
      Pleas&rsquo;d with his action, ravish&rsquo;d with his face:<br />
      Then answer&rsquo;d briefly, with a royal grace:<br />
      &ldquo;O valiant leader of the Trojan line,<br />
      In whom the features of thy father shine,<br />
      How I recall Anchises! how I see<br />
      His motions, mien, and all my friend, in thee!<br />
      Long tho&rsquo; it be, &rsquo;tis fresh within my mind,<br />
      When Priam to his sister&rsquo;s court design&rsquo;d<br />
      A welcome visit, with a friendly stay,<br />
      And thro&rsquo; th&rsquo; Arcadian kingdom took his way.<br />
      Then, past a boy, the callow down began<br />
      To shade my chin, and call me first a man.<br />
      I saw the shining train with vast delight,<br />
      And Priam&rsquo;s goodly person pleas&rsquo;d my sight:<br />
      But great Anchises, far above the rest,<br />
      With awful wonder fir&rsquo;d my youthful breast.<br />
      I long&rsquo;d to join in friendship&rsquo;s holy bands<br />
      Our mutual hearts, and plight our mutual hands.<br />
      I first accosted him: I sued, I sought,<br />
      And, with a loving force, to Pheneus brought.<br />
      He gave me, when at length constrain&rsquo;d to go,<br />
      A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow,<br />
      A vest embroider&rsquo;d, glorious to behold,<br />
      And two rich bridles, with their bits of gold,<br />
      Which my son&rsquo;s coursers in obedience hold.<br />
      The league you ask, I offer, as your right;<br />
      And, when tomorrow&rsquo;s sun reveals the light,<br />
      With swift supplies you shall be sent away.<br />
      Now celebrate with us this solemn day,<br />
      Whose holy rites admit no long delay.<br />
      Honour our annual feast; and take your seat,<br />
      With friendly welcome, at a homely treat.&rdquo;<br />
      Thus having said, the bowls remov&rsquo;d (for fear)<br />
      The youths replac&rsquo;d, and soon restor&rsquo;d the cheer.<br />
      On sods of turf he set the soldiers round:<br />
      A maple throne, rais&rsquo;d higher from the ground,<br />
      Receiv&rsquo;d the Trojan chief; and, o&rsquo;er the bed,<br />
      A lion&rsquo;s shaggy hide for ornament they spread.<br />
      The loaves were serv&rsquo;d in canisters; the wine<br />
      In bowls; the priest renew&rsquo;d the rites divine:<br />
      Broil&rsquo;d entrails are their food, and beef&rsquo;s continued chine.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      But when the rage of hunger was repress&rsquo;d,<br />
      Thus spoke Evander to his royal guest:<br />
      &ldquo;These rites, these altars, and this feast, O king,<br />
      From no vain fears or superstition spring,<br />
      Or blind devotion, or from blinder chance,<br />
      Or heady zeal, or brutal ignorance;<br />
      But, sav&rsquo;d from danger, with a grateful sense,<br />
      The labours of a god we recompense.<br />
      See, from afar, yon rock that mates the sky,<br />
      About whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie;<br />
      Such indigested ruin; bleak and bare,<br />
      How desert now it stands, expos&rsquo;d in air!<br />
      &rsquo;Twas once a robber&rsquo;s den, inclos&rsquo;d around<br />
      With living stone, and deep beneath the ground.<br />
      The monster Cacus, more than half a beast,<br />
      This hold, impervious to the sun, possess&rsquo;d.<br />
      The pavement ever foul with human gore;<br />
      Heads, and their mangled members, hung the door.<br />
      Vulcan this plague begot; and, like his sire,<br />
      Black clouds he belch&rsquo;d, and flakes of livid fire.<br />
      Time, long expected, eas&rsquo;d us of our load,<br />
      And brought the needful presence of a god.<br />
      Th&rsquo; avenging force of Hercules, from Spain,<br />
      Arriv&rsquo;d in triumph, from Geryon slain:<br />
      Thrice liv&rsquo;d the giant, and thrice liv&rsquo;d in vain.<br />
      His prize, the lowing herds, Alcides drove<br />
      Near Tiber&rsquo;s bank, to graze the shady grove.<br />
      Allur&rsquo;d with hope of plunder, and intent<br />
      By force to rob, by fraud to circumvent,<br />
      The brutal Cacus, as by chance they stray&rsquo;d,<br />
      Four oxen thence, and four fair kine convey&rsquo;d;<br />
      And, lest the printed footsteps might be seen,<br />
      He dragg&rsquo;d &rsquo;em backwards to his rocky den.<br />
      The tracks averse a lying notice gave,<br />
      And led the searcher backward from the cave.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place,<br />
      To find fresh pasture and untrodden grass.<br />
      The beasts, who miss&rsquo;d their mates, fill&rsquo;d all around<br />
      With bellowings, and the rocks restor&rsquo;d the sound.<br />
      One heifer, who had heard her love complain,<br />
      Roar&rsquo;d from the cave, and made the project vain.<br />
      Alcides found the fraud; with rage he shook,<br />
      And toss&rsquo;d about his head his knotted oak.<br />
      Swift as the winds, or Scythian arrows&rsquo; flight,<br />
      He clomb, with eager haste, th&rsquo; aerial height.<br />
      Then first we saw the monster mend his pace;<br />
      Fear in his eyes, and paleness in his face,<br />
      Confess&rsquo;d the god&rsquo;s approach. Trembling he springs,<br />
      As terror had increas&rsquo;d his feet with wings;<br />
      Nor stay&rsquo;d for stairs; but down the depth he threw<br />
      His body, on his back the door he drew<br />
      (The door, a rib of living rock; with pains<br />
      His father hew&rsquo;d it out, and bound with iron chains):<br />
      He broke the heavy links, the mountain clos&rsquo;d,<br />
      And bars and levers to his foe oppos&rsquo;d.<br />
      The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast;<br />
      The fierce avenger came with bounding haste;<br />
      Survey&rsquo;d the mouth of the forbidden hold,<br />
      And here and there his raging eyes he roll&rsquo;d.<br />
      He gnash&rsquo;d his teeth; and thrice he compass&rsquo;d round<br />
      With winged speed the circuit of the ground.<br />
      Thrice at the cavern&rsquo;s mouth he pull&rsquo;d in vain,<br />
      And, panting, thrice desisted from his pain.<br />
      A pointed flinty rock, all bare and black,<br />
      Grew gibbous from behind the mountain&rsquo;s back;<br />
      Owls, ravens, all ill omens of the night,<br />
      Here built their nests, and hither wing&rsquo;d their flight.<br />
      The leaning head hung threat&rsquo;ning o&rsquo;er the flood,<br />
      And nodded to the left. The hero stood<br />
      Adverse, with planted feet, and, from the right,<br />
      Tugg&rsquo;d at the solid stone with all his might.<br />
      Thus heav&rsquo;d, the fix&rsquo;d foundations of the rock<br />
      Gave way; heav&rsquo;n echo&rsquo;d at the rattling shock.<br />
      Tumbling, it chok&rsquo;d the flood: on either side<br />
      The banks leap backward, and the streams divide;<br />
      The sky shrunk upward with unusual dread,<br />
      And trembling Tiber div&rsquo;d beneath his bed.<br />
      The court of Cacus stands reveal&rsquo;d to sight;<br />
      The cavern glares with new-admitted light.<br />
      So the pent vapours, with a rumbling sound,<br />
      Heave from below, and rend the hollow ground;<br />
      A sounding flaw succeeds; and, from on high,<br />
      The gods with hate beheld the nether sky:<br />
      The ghosts repine at violated night,<br />
      And curse th&rsquo; invading sun, and sicken at the sight.<br />
      The graceless monster, caught in open day,<br />
      Inclos&rsquo;d, and in despair to fly away,<br />
      Howls horrible from underneath, and fills<br />
      His hollow palace with unmanly yells.<br />
      The hero stands above, and from afar<br />
      Plies him with darts, and stones, and distant war.<br />
      He, from his nostrils huge mouth, expires<br />
      Black clouds of smoke, amidst his father&rsquo;s fires,<br />
      Gath&rsquo;ring, with each repeated blast, the night,<br />
      To make uncertain aim, and erring sight.<br />
      The wrathful god then plunges from above,<br />
      And, where in thickest waves the sparkles drove,<br />
      There lights; and wades thro&rsquo; fumes, and gropes his way,<br />
      Half sing&rsquo;d, half stifled, till he grasps his prey.<br />
      The monster, spewing fruitless flames, he found;<br />
      He squeez&rsquo;d his throat; he writh&rsquo;d his neck around,<br />
      And in a knot his crippled members bound;<br />
      Then from their sockets tore his burning eyes:<br />
      Roll&rsquo;d on a heap, the breathless robber lies.<br />
      The doors, unbarr&rsquo;d, receive the rushing day,<br />
      And thoro&rsquo; lights disclose the ravish&rsquo;d prey.<br />
      The bulls, redeem&rsquo;d, breathe open air again.<br />
      Next, by the feet, they drag him from his den.<br />
      The wond&rsquo;ring neighbourhood, with glad surprise,<br />
      Behold his shagged breast, his giant size,<br />
      His mouth that flames no more, and his extinguish&rsquo;d eyes.<br />
      From that auspicious day, with rites divine,<br />
      We worship at the hero&rsquo;s holy shrine.<br />
      Potitius first ordain&rsquo;d these annual vows:<br />
      As priests, were added the Pinarian house,<br />
      Who rais&rsquo;d this altar in the sacred shade,<br />
      Where honours, ever due, for ever shall be paid.<br />
      For these deserts, and this high virtue shown,<br />
      Ye warlike youths, your heads with garlands crown:<br />
      Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood,<br />
      And with deep draughts invoke our common god.&rdquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      This said, a double wreath Evander twin&rsquo;d,<br />
      And poplars black and white his temples bind.<br />
      Then brims his ample bowl. With like design<br />
      The rest invoke the gods, with sprinkled wine.<br />
      Meantime the sun descended from the skies,<br />
      And the bright evening star began to rise.<br />
      And now the priests, Potitius at their head,<br />
      In skins of beasts involv&rsquo;d, the long procession led;<br />
      Held high the flaming tapers in their hands,<br />
      As custom had prescrib&rsquo;d their holy bands;<br />
      Then with a second course the tables load,<br />
      And with full chargers offer to the god.<br />
      The Salii sing, and cense his altars round<br />
      With Saban smoke, their heads with poplar bound<br />
      One choir of old, another of the young,<br />
      To dance, and bear the burthen of the song.<br />
      The lay records the labours, and the praise,<br />
      And all th&rsquo; immortal acts of Hercules:<br />
      First, how the mighty babe, when swath&rsquo;d in bands,<br />
      The serpents strangled with his infant hands;<br />
      Then, as in years and matchless force he grew,<br />
      Th&rsquo; Oechalian walls, and Trojan, overthrew.<br />
      Besides, a thousand hazards they relate,<br />
      Procur&rsquo;d by Juno&rsquo;s and Eurystheus&rsquo; hate:<br />
      &ldquo;Thy hands, unconquer&rsquo;d hero, could subdue<br />
      The cloud-born Centaurs, and the monster crew:<br />
      Nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood,<br />
      Nor he, the roaring terror of the wood.<br />
      The triple porter of the Stygian seat,<br />
      With lolling tongue, lay fawning at thy feet,<br />
      And, seiz&rsquo;d with fear, forgot his mangled meat.<br />
      Th&rsquo; infernal waters trembled at thy sight;<br />
      Thee, god, no face of danger could affright;<br />
      Not huge Typhoeus, nor th&rsquo; unnumber&rsquo;d snake,<br />
      Increas&rsquo;d with hissing heads, in Lerna&rsquo;s lake.<br />
      Hail, Jove&rsquo;s undoubted son! an added grace<br />
      To heav&rsquo;n and the great author of thy race!<br />
      Receive the grateful off&rsquo;rings which we pay,<br />
      And smile propitious on thy solemn day!&rdquo;<br />
      In numbers thus they sung; above the rest,<br />
      The den and death of Cacus crown the feast.<br />
      The woods to hollow vales convey the sound,<br />
      The vales to hills, and hills the notes rebound.<br />
      The rites perform&rsquo;d, the cheerful train retire.<br />

      Betwixt young Pallas and his aged sire,<br />
      The Trojan pass&rsquo;d, the city to survey,<br />
      And pleasing talk beguil&rsquo;d the tedious way.<br />
      The stranger cast around his curious eyes,<br />
      New objects viewing still, with new surprise;<br />
      With greedy joy enquires of various things,<br />
      And acts and monuments of ancient kings.<br />
      Then thus the founder of the Roman tow&rsquo;rs:<br />
      &ldquo;These woods were first the seat of sylvan pow&rsquo;rs,<br />
      Of Nymphs and Fauns, and salvage men, who took<br />
      Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak.<br />
      Nor laws they knew, nor manners, nor the care<br />
      Of lab&rsquo;ring oxen, or the shining share,<br />
      Nor arts of gain, nor what they gain&rsquo;d to spare.<br />
      Their exercise the chase; the running flood<br />
      Supplied their thirst, the trees supplied their food.<br />
      Then Saturn came, who fled the pow&rsquo;r of Jove,<br />
      Robb&rsquo;d of his realms, and banish&rsquo;d from above.<br />
      The men, dispers&rsquo;d on hills, to towns he brought,<br />
      And laws ordain&rsquo;d, and civil customs taught,<br />
      And Latium call&rsquo;d the land where safe he lay<br />
      From his unduteous son, and his usurping sway.<br />
      With his mild empire, peace and plenty came;<br />
      And hence the golden times deriv&rsquo;d their name.<br />
      A more degenerate and discolour&rsquo;d age<br />
      Succeeded this, with avarice and rage.<br />
      Th&rsquo; Ausonians then, and bold Sicanians came;<br />
      And Saturn&rsquo;s empire often chang&rsquo;d the name.<br />
      Then kings, gigantic Tybris, and the rest,<br />
      With arbitrary sway the land oppress&rsquo;d:<br />
      For Tiber&rsquo;s flood was Albula before,<br />
      Till, from the tyrant&rsquo;s fate, his name it bore.<br />
      I last arriv&rsquo;d, driv&rsquo;n from my native home<br />
      By fortune&rsquo;s pow&rsquo;r, and fate&rsquo;s resistless doom.<br />
      Long toss&rsquo;d on seas, I sought this happy land,<br />
      Warn&rsquo;d by my mother nymph, and call&rsquo;d by Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s command.&rdquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Thus, walking on, he spoke, and shew&rsquo;d the gate,<br />
      Since call&rsquo;d Carmental by the Roman state;<br />
      Where stood an altar, sacred to the name<br />
      Of old Carmenta, the prophetic dame,<br />
      Who to her son foretold th&rsquo; Aenean race,<br />
      Sublime in fame, and Rome&rsquo;s imperial place:<br />
      Then shews the forest, which, in after times,<br />
      Fierce Romulus for perpetrated crimes<br />
      A sacred refuge made; with this, the shrine<br />
      Where Pan below the rock had rites divine:<br />
      Then tells of Argus&rsquo; death, his murder&rsquo;d guest,<br />
      Whose grave and tomb his innocence attest.<br />
      Thence, to the steep Tarpeian rock he leads;<br />
      Now roof&rsquo;d with gold, then thatch&rsquo;d with homely reeds.<br />
      A reverent fear (such superstition reigns<br />
      Among the rude) ev&rsquo;n then possess&rsquo;d the swains.<br />
      Some god, they knew&mdash;what god, they could not tell&mdash;<br />
      Did there amidst the sacred horror dwell.<br />
      Th&rsquo; Arcadians thought him Jove; and said they saw<br />
      The mighty Thund&rsquo;rer with majestic awe,<br />
      Who took his shield, and dealt his bolts around,<br />
      And scatter&rsquo;d tempests on the teeming ground.<br />
      Then saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood<br />
      Two stately towns, on either side the flood,)<br />
      Saturnia&rsquo;s and Janiculum&rsquo;s remains;<br />
      And either place the founder&rsquo;s name retains.<br />
      Discoursing thus together, they resort<br />
      Where poor Evander kept his country court.<br />
      They view&rsquo;d the ground of Rome&rsquo;s litigious hall;<br />
      (Once oxen low&rsquo;d, where now the lawyers bawl;)<br />
      Then, stooping, thro&rsquo; the narrow gate they press&rsquo;d,<br />
      When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest:<br />
      &ldquo;Mean as it is, this palace, and this door,<br />
      Receiv&rsquo;d Alcides, then a conqueror.<br />
      Dare to be poor; accept our homely food,<br />
      Which feasted him, and emulate a god.&rdquo;<br />
      Then underneath a lowly roof he led<br />
      The weary prince, and laid him on a bed;<br />
      The stuffing leaves, with hides of bears o&rsquo;erspread.<br />
      Now night had shed her silver dews around,<br />
      And with her sable wings embrac&rsquo;d the ground,<br />
      When love&rsquo;s fair goddess, anxious for her son,<br />
      (New tumults rising, and new wars begun,)<br />
      Couch&rsquo;d with her husband in his golden bed,<br />
      With these alluring words invokes his aid;<br />
      And, that her pleasing speech his mind may move,<br />
      Inspires each accent with the charms of love:<br />
      &ldquo;While cruel fate conspir&rsquo;d with Grecian pow&rsquo;rs,<br />
      To level with the ground the Trojan tow&rsquo;rs,<br />
      I ask&rsquo;d not aid th&rsquo; unhappy to restore,<br />
      Nor did the succour of thy skill implore;<br />
      Nor urg&rsquo;d the labours of my lord in vain,<br />
      A sinking empire longer to sustain,<br />
      Tho&rsquo; much I ow&rsquo;d to Priam&rsquo;s house, and more<br />
      The dangers of Aeneas did deplore.<br />
      But now, by Jove&rsquo;s command, and fate&rsquo;s decree,<br />
      His race is doom&rsquo;d to reign in Italy:<br />
      With humble suit I beg thy needful art,<br />
      O still propitious pow&rsquo;r, that rules my heart!<br />
      A mother kneels a suppliant for her son.<br />
      By Thetis and Aurora thou wert won<br />
      To forge impenetrable shields, and grace<br />
      With fated arms a less illustrious race.<br />
      Behold, what haughty nations are combin&rsquo;d<br />
      Against the relics of the Phrygian kind,<br />
      With fire and sword my people to destroy,<br />
      And conquer Venus twice, in conqu&rsquo;ring Troy.&rdquo;<br />
      She said; and straight her arms, of snowy hue,<br />
      About her unresolving husband threw.<br />
      Her soft embraces soon infuse desire;<br />
      His bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire;<br />
      And all the godhead feels the wonted fire.<br />
      Not half so swift the rattling thunder flies,<br />
      Or forky lightnings flash along the skies.<br />
      The goddess, proud of her successful wiles,<br />
      And conscious of her form, in secret smiles.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Then thus the pow&rsquo;r, obnoxious to her charms,<br />
      Panting, and half dissolving in her arms:<br />
      &ldquo;Why seek you reasons for a cause so just,<br />
      Or your own beauties or my love distrust?<br />
      Long since, had you requir&rsquo;d my helpful hand,<br />
      Th&rsquo; artificer and art you might command,<br />
      To labour arms for Troy: nor Jove, nor fate,<br />
      Confin&rsquo;d their empire to so short a date.<br />
      And, if you now desire new wars to wage,<br />
      My skill I promise, and my pains engage.<br />
      Whatever melting metals can conspire,<br />
      Or breathing bellows, or the forming fire,<br />
      Is freely yours: your anxious fears remove,<br />
      And think no task is difficult to love.&rdquo;<br />
      Trembling he spoke; and, eager of her charms,<br />
      He snatch&rsquo;d the willing goddess to his arms;<br />
      Till in her lap infus&rsquo;d, he lay possess&rsquo;d<br />
      Of full desire, and sunk to pleasing rest.<br />
      Now when the night her middle race had rode,<br />
      And his first slumber had refresh&rsquo;d the god&mdash;<br />
      The time when early housewives leave the bed;<br />
      When living embers on the hearth they spread,<br />
      Supply the lamp, and call the maids to rise;&mdash;<br />
      With yawning mouths, and with half-open&rsquo;d eyes,<br />
      They ply the distaff by the winking light,<br />
      And to their daily labour add the night:<br />
      Thus frugally they earn their children&rsquo;s bread,<br />
      And uncorrupted keep the nuptial bed&mdash;<br />
      Not less concern&rsquo;d, nor at a later hour,<br />
      Rose from his downy couch the forging pow&rsquo;r.<br />

      Sacred to Vulcan&rsquo;s name, an isle there lay,<br />
      Betwixt Sicilia&rsquo;s coasts and Lipare,<br />
      Rais&rsquo;d high on smoking rocks; and, deep below,<br />
      In hollow caves the fires of Aetna glow.<br />
      The Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal;<br />
      Loud strokes, and hissings of tormented steel,<br />
      Are heard around; the boiling waters roar,<br />
      And smoky flames thro&rsquo; fuming tunnels soar.<br />
      Hither the Father of the Fire, by night,<br />
      Thro&rsquo; the brown air precipitates his flight.<br />
      On their eternal anvils here he found<br />
      The brethren beating, and the blows go round.<br />
      A load of pointless thunder now there lies<br />
      Before their hands, to ripen for the skies:<br />
      These darts, for angry Jove, they daily cast;<br />
      Consum&rsquo;d on mortals with prodigious waste.<br />
      Three rays of writhen rain, of fire three more,<br />
      Of winged southern winds and cloudy store<br />
      As many parts, the dreadful mixture frame;<br />
      And fears are added, and avenging flame.<br />
      Inferior ministers, for Mars, repair<br />
      His broken axletrees and blunted war,<br />
      And send him forth again with furbish&rsquo;d arms,<br />

      The shield of Pallas, and renew their gold.<br />

      &ldquo;My sons,&rdquo; said Vulcan, &ldquo;set your tasks aside;<br />

      Your force, your speed, and all your forming fire.&rdquo;<br />
      He said. They set their former work aside,<br />
      And their new toils with eager haste divide.<br />
      A flood of molten silver, brass, and gold,<br />
      And deadly steel, in the large furnace roll&rsquo;d;<br />

      Alone sufficient to sustain the war.<br />

      One stirs the fire, and one the bellows blows.<br />
      The hissing steel is in the smithy drown&rsquo;d;<br />
      The grot with beaten anvils groans around.<br />

      He leaves his lowly bed: his buskins meet<br />
      Above his ankles; sandals sheathe his feet:<br />
      He sets his trusty sword upon his side,<br />

      Our narrow kingdom here the Tiber bounds;<br />
      That other side the Latian state surrounds,<br />

      You come, as by your better genius sent,<br />
      And fortune seems to favour your intent.<br />
      Not far from hence there stands a hilly town,<br />
      Of ancient building, and of high renown,<br />
      Torn from the Tuscans by the Lydian race,<br />
      Who gave the name of Caere to the place,<br />
      Once Agyllina call&rsquo;d. It flourish&rsquo;d long,<br />
      In pride of wealth and warlike people strong,<br />
      Till curs&rsquo;d Mezentius, in a fatal hour,<br />

      On his own head, and on his impious race!<br />
      The living and the dead at his command<br />
      Were coupled, face to face, and hand to hand,<br />
      Till, chok&rsquo;d with stench, in loath&rsquo;d embraces tied,<br />
      The ling&rsquo;ring wretches pin&rsquo;d away and died.<br />
      Thus plung&rsquo;d in ills, and meditating more&mdash;<br />

      With arms, their king to punishment require:<br />
      Their num&rsquo;rous troops, now muster&rsquo;d on the strand,<br />
      My counsel shall submit to your command.<br />
      Their navy swarms upon the coasts; they cry<br />
      To hoist their anchors, but the gods deny.<br />
      An ancient augur, skill&rsquo;d in future fate,<br />
      With these foreboding words restrains their hate:<br />
      &lsquo;Ye brave in arms, ye Lydian blood, the flow&rsquo;r<br />
      Of Tuscan youth, and choice of all their pow&rsquo;r,<br />
      Whom just revenge against Mezentius arms,<br />
      To seek your tyrant&rsquo;s death by lawful arms;<br />
      Know this: no native of our land may lead<br />
      This pow&rsquo;rful people; seek a foreign head.&rsquo;<br />
      Aw&rsquo;d with these words, in camps they still abide,<br />
      And wait with longing looks their promis&rsquo;d guide.<br />
      Tarchon, the Tuscan chief, to me has sent<br />
      Their crown, and ev&rsquo;ry regal ornament:<br />
      The people join their own with his desire;<br />
      And all my conduct, as their king, require.<br />
      But the chill blood that creeps within my veins,<br />
      And age, and listless limbs unfit for pains,<br />
      And a soul conscious of its own decay,<br />
      Have forc&rsquo;d me to refuse imperial sway.<br />
      My Pallas were more fit to mount the throne,<br />
      And should, but he&rsquo;s a Sabine mother&rsquo;s son,<br />
      And half a native; but, in you, combine<br />
      A manly vigour, and a foreign line.<br />
      Where Fate and smiling Fortune shew the way,<br />
      Pursue the ready path to sov&rsquo;reign sway.<br />
      The staff of my declining days, my son,<br />
      Shall make your good or ill success his own;<br />
      In fighting fields from you shall learn to dare,<br />
      And serve the hard apprenticeship of war;<br />
      Your matchless courage and your conduct view,<br />
      And early shall begin t&rsquo; admire and copy you.<br />
      Besides, two hundred horse he shall command;<br />

      The matrons beat their breasts, dissolve in tears,<br />
      And double their devotion in their fears.<br />
      The war at hand appears with more affright,<br />
      And rises ev&rsquo;ry moment to the sight.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Then old Evander, with a close embrace,<br />
      Strain&rsquo;d his departing friend; and tears o&rsquo;erflow his face.<br />
      &ldquo;Would Heav&rsquo;n,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my strength and youth recall,<br />
      Such as I was beneath Praeneste&rsquo;s wall;<br />
      Then when I made the foremost foes retire,<br />
      And set whole heaps of conquer&rsquo;d shields on fire;<br />
      When Herilus in single fight I slew,<br />
      Whom with three lives Feronia did endue;<br />
      And thrice I sent him to the Stygian shore,<br />
      Till the last ebbing soul return&rsquo;d no more&mdash;<br />
      Such if I stood renew&rsquo;d, not these alarms,<br />
      Nor death, should rend me from my Pallas&rsquo; arms;<br />
      Nor proud Mezentius, thus unpunish&rsquo;d, boast<br />
      His rapes and murders on the Tuscan coast.<br />
      Ye gods, and mighty Jove, in pity bring<br />
      Relief, and hear a father and a king!<br />
      If fate and you reserve these eyes, to see<br />
      My son return with peace and victory;<br />
      If the lov&rsquo;d boy shall bless his father&rsquo;s sight;<br />
      If we shall meet again with more delight;<br />
      Then draw my life in length; let me sustain,<br />
      In hopes of his embrace, the worst of pain.<br />
      But if your hard decrees&mdash;which, O! I dread&mdash;<br />
      Have doom&rsquo;d to death his undeserving head;<br />
      This, O this very moment, let me die!<br />
      While hopes and fears in equal balance lie;<br />
      While, yet possess&rsquo;d of all his youthful charms,<br />
      I strain him close within these aged arms;<br />
      Before that fatal news my soul shall wound!&rdquo;<br />
      He said, and, swooning, sunk upon the ground.<br />
      His servants bore him off, and softly laid<br />
      His languish&rsquo;d limbs upon his homely bed.<br />

      The horsemen march; the gates are open&rsquo;d wide;<br />

      Young Pallas shone conspicuous o&rsquo;er the rest;<br />
      Gilded his arms, embroider&rsquo;d was his vest.<br />

      The star by whom the lights of heav&rsquo;n are led;<br />
      Shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews,<br />
      Dispels the darkness, and the day renews.<br />

      The troops, drawn up in beautiful array,<br />

      Meantime the mother goddess, crown&rsquo;d with charms,<br />
      Breaks thro&rsquo; the clouds, and brings the fated arms.<br />
      Within a winding vale she finds her son,<br />
      On the cool river&rsquo;s banks, retir&rsquo;d alone.<br />
      She shews her heav&rsquo;nly form without disguise,<br />
      And gives herself to his desiring eyes.<br />
      &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;perform&rsquo;d in ev&rsquo;ry part,<br />
      My promise made, and Vulcan&rsquo;s labour&rsquo;d art.<br />
      Now seek, secure, the Latian enemy,<br />
      And haughty Turnus to the field defy.&rdquo;<br />
      She said; and, having first her son embrac&rsquo;d,<br />
      The radiant arms beneath an oak she plac&rsquo;d,<br />
      Proud of the gift, he roll&rsquo;d his greedy sight<br />
      Around the work, and gaz&rsquo;d with vast delight.<br />
      He lifts, he turns, he poises, and admires<br />
      The crested helm, that vomits radiant fires:<br />
      His hands the fatal sword and corslet hold,<br />
      One keen with temper&rsquo;d steel, one stiff with gold:<br />
      Both ample, flaming both, and beamy bright;<br />
      So shines a cloud, when edg&rsquo;d with adverse light.<br />
      He shakes the pointed spear, and longs to try<br />
      The plated cuishes on his manly thigh;<br />
      But most admires the shield&rsquo;s mysterious mould,<br />
      And Roman triumphs rising on the gold:<br />
      For these, emboss&rsquo;d, the heav&rsquo;nly smith had wrought<br />
      (Not in the rolls of future fate untaught)<br />
      The wars in order, and the race divine<br />
      Of warriors issuing from the Julian line.<br />
      The cave of Mars was dress&rsquo;d with mossy greens:<br />
      There, by the wolf, were laid the martial twins.<br />
      Intrepid on her swelling dugs they hung;<br />
      The foster dam loll&rsquo;d out her fawning tongue:<br />
      They suck&rsquo;d secure, while, bending back her head,<br />
      She lick&rsquo;d their tender limbs, and form&rsquo;d them as they fed.<br />
      Not far from thence new Rome appears, with games<br />
      Projected for the rape of Sabine dames.<br />
      The pit resounds with shrieks; a war succeeds,<br />
      For breach of public faith, and unexampled deeds.<br />
      Here for revenge the Sabine troops contend;<br />
      The Romans there with arms the prey defend.<br />
      Wearied with tedious war, at length they cease;<br />
      And both the kings and kingdoms plight the peace.<br />
      The friendly chiefs before Jove&rsquo;s altar stand,<br />
      Both arm&rsquo;d, with each a charger in his hand:<br />
      A fatted sow for sacrifice is led,<br />
      With imprecations on the perjur&rsquo;d head.<br />
      Near this, the traitor Metius, stretch&rsquo;d between<br />
      Four fiery steeds, is dragg&rsquo;d along the green,<br />
      By Tullus&rsquo; doom: the brambles drink his blood,<br />
      And his torn limbs are left the vulture&rsquo;s food.<br />
      There, Porsena to Rome proud Tarquin brings,<br />
      And would by force restore the banish&rsquo;d kings.<br />
      One tyrant for his fellow-tyrant fights;<br />
      The Roman youth assert their native rights.<br />
      Before the town the Tuscan army lies,<br />
      To win by famine, or by fraud surprise.<br />
      Their king, half-threat&rsquo;ning, half-disdaining stood,<br />
      While Cocles broke the bridge, and stemm&rsquo;d the flood.<br />
      The captive maids there tempt the raging tide,<br />
      Scap&rsquo;d from their chains, with Cloelia for their guide.<br />
      High on a rock heroic Manlius stood,<br />
      To guard the temple, and the temple&rsquo;s god.<br />
      Then Rome was poor; and there you might behold<br />
      The palace thatch&rsquo;d with straw, now roof&rsquo;d with gold.<br />
      The silver goose before the shining gate<br />
      There flew, and, by her cackle, sav&rsquo;d the state.<br />
      She told the Gauls&rsquo; approach; th&rsquo; approaching Gauls,<br />
      Obscure in night, ascend, and seize the walls.<br />
      The gold dissembled well their yellow hair,<br />
      And golden chains on their white necks they wear.<br />
      Gold are their vests; long Alpine spears they wield,<br />
      And their left arm sustains a length of shield.<br />
      Hard by, the leaping Salian priests advance;<br />
      And naked thro&rsquo; the streets the mad Luperci dance,<br />
      In caps of wool; the targets dropp&rsquo;d from heav&rsquo;n.<br />
      Here modest matrons, in soft litters driv&rsquo;n,<br />
      To pay their vows in solemn pomp appear,<br />
      And odorous gums in their chaste hands they bear.<br />
      Far hence remov&rsquo;d, the Stygian seats are seen;<br />
      Pains of the damn&rsquo;d, and punish&rsquo;d Catiline<br />
      Hung on a rock&mdash;the traitor; and, around,<br />
      The Furies hissing from the nether ground.<br />
      Apart from these, the happy souls he draws,<br />
      And Cato&rsquo;s holy ghost dispensing laws.<br />

      His arms and ample bosom to the tide,<br />

      The victor to the gods his thanks express&rsquo;d,<br />
      And Rome, triumphant, with his presence bless&rsquo;d.<br />
      Three hundred temples in the town he plac&rsquo;d;<br />
      With spoils and altars ev&rsquo;ry temple grac&rsquo;d.<br />
      Three shining nights, and three succeeding days,<br />
      The fields resound with shouts, the streets with praise,<br />
      The domes with songs, the theatres with plays.<br />

    <h5> THE ARGUMENT. </h5>

    <p>
      Turnus takes advantage of Aeneas&rsquo;s absence, fires some of his ships
      (which are transformed into sea nymphs,) and assaults his camp. The Trojans,
      reduced to the last extremities, send Ninus and Euryalus to recall Aeneas;
      which furnishes the poet with that admirable episode of their friendship,
      generosity, and the conclusion of their adventure.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile these affairs in distant places pass&rsquo;d,<br />
      The various Iris Juno sends with haste,<br />
      To find bold Turnus, who, with anxious thought,<br />
      The secret shade of his great grandsire sought.<br />
      Retir&rsquo;d alone she found the daring man,<br />
      And op&rsquo;d her rosy lips, and thus began:<br />
      &ldquo;What none of all the gods could grant thy vows,<br />
      That, Turnus, this auspicious day bestows.<br />
      Aeneas, gone to seek th&rsquo; Arcadian prince,<br />
      Has left the Trojan camp without defence;<br />
      And, short of succours there, employs his pains<br />
      In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains.<br />
      Now snatch an hour that favours thy designs;<br />
      Unite thy forces, and attack their lines.&rdquo;<br />
      This said, on equal wings she pois&rsquo;d her weight,<br />

      Has sent thee down, thro&rsquo; dusky clouds to shine?<br />
      See, they divide; immortal day appears,<br />
      And glitt&rsquo;ring planets dancing in their spheres!<br />
      With joy, these happy omens I obey,<br />
      And follow to the war the god that leads the way.&rdquo;<br />
      Thus having said, as by the brook he stood,<br />

      Now march the bold confed&rsquo;rates thro&rsquo; the plain,<br />

      Messapus leads the van; and, in the rear,<br />
      The sons of Tyrrheus in bright arms appear.<br />
      In the main battle, with his flaming crest,<br />
      The mighty Turnus tow&rsquo;rs above the rest.<br />
      Silent they move, majestically slow,<br />
      Like ebbing Nile, or Ganges in his flow.<br />
      The Trojans view the dusty cloud from far,<br />
      And the dark menace of the distant war.<br />
      Caicus from the rampire saw it rise,<br />
      Black&rsquo;ning the fields, and thick&rsquo;ning thro&rsquo; the skies.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Thus warn&rsquo;d, they shut their gates; with shouts ascend<br />
      The bulwarks, and, secure, their foes attend:<br />
      For their wise gen&rsquo;ral, with foreseeing care,<br />
      Had charg&rsquo;d them not to tempt the doubtful war,<br />
      Nor, tho&rsquo; provok&rsquo;d, in open fields advance,<br />
      But close within their lines attend their chance.<br />
      Unwilling, yet they keep the strict command,<br />
      And sourly wait in arms the hostile band.<br />
      The fiery Turnus flew before the rest:<br />
      A piebald steed of Thracian strain he press&rsquo;d;<br />
      His helm of massy gold, and crimson was his crest.<br />
      With twenty horse to second his designs,<br />
      An unexpected foe, he fac&rsquo;d the lines.<br />
      &ldquo;Is there,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;in arms, who bravely dare<br />
      His leader&rsquo;s honour and his danger share?&rdquo;<br />
      Then spurring on, his brandish&rsquo;d dart he threw,<br />
      In sign of war: applauding shouts ensue.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Amaz&rsquo;d to find a dastard race, that run<br />
      Behind the rampires and the battle shun,<br />

      So roams the nightly wolf about the fold:<br />
      Wet with descending show&rsquo;rs, and stiff with cold,<br />
      He howls for hunger, and he grins for pain,<br />
      (His gnashing teeth are exercis&rsquo;d in vain,)<br />
      And, impotent of anger, finds no way<br />
      In his distended paws to grasp the prey.<br />
      The mothers listen; but the bleating lambs<br />
      Securely swig the dug, beneath the dams.<br />
      Thus ranges eager Turnus o&rsquo;er the plain.<br />
      Sharp with desire, and furious with disdain;<br />
      Surveys each passage with a piercing sight,<br />
      To force his foes in equal field to fight.<br />
      Thus while he gazes round, at length he spies,<br />
      Where, fenc&rsquo;d with strong redoubts, their navy lies,<br />
      Close underneath the walls; the washing tide<br />
      Secures from all approach this weaker side.<br />
      He takes the wish&rsquo;d occasion, fills his hand<br />
      With ready fires, and shakes a flaming brand.<br />
      Urg&rsquo;d by his presence, ev&rsquo;ry soul is warm&rsquo;d,<br />
      And ev&rsquo;ry hand with kindled fires is arm&rsquo;d.<br />
      From the fir&rsquo;d pines the scatt&rsquo;ring sparkles fly;<br />
      Fat vapours, mix&rsquo;d with flames, involve the sky.<br />
      What pow&rsquo;r, O Muses, could avert the flame<br />
      Which threaten&rsquo;d, in the fleet, the Trojan name?<br />

      &rsquo;Tis said that, when the chief prepar&rsquo;d his flight,<br />
      And fell&rsquo;d his timber from Mount Ida&rsquo;s height,<br />

      And with a mother&rsquo;s majesty begun:<br />

      On Ida&rsquo;s brows, for ages past, there stood,<br />

      Where I was worship&rsquo;d with religious love.<br />
      Those woods, that holy grove, my long delight,<br />

      The floating forests of the sacred pine;<br />
      But let it be their safety to be mine.&rdquo;<br />

      Yet, what I can, I grant; when, wafted o&rsquo;er,<br />
      The chief is landed on the Latian shore,<br />
      Whatever ships escape the raging storms,<br />
      At my command shall change their fading forms<br />
      To nymphs divine, and plow the wat&rsquo;ry way,<br />
      Like Dotis and the daughters of the sea.&rdquo;<br />
      To seal his sacred vow, by Styx he swore,<br />
      The lake of liquid pitch, the dreary shore,<br />
      And Phlegethon&rsquo;s innavigable flood,<br />
      And the black regions of his brother god.<br />
      He said; and shook the skies with his imperial nod.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      And now at length the number&rsquo;d hours were come,<br />
      Prefix&rsquo;d by fate&rsquo;s irrevocable doom,<br />
      When the great Mother of the Gods was free<br />
      To save her ships, and finish Jove&rsquo;s decree.<br />
      First, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung<br />
      A light that sign&rsquo;d the heav&rsquo;ns, and shot along;<br />
      Then from a cloud, fring&rsquo;d round with golden fires,<br />
      Were timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs;<br />
      And, last, a voice, with more than mortal sounds,<br />
      Both hosts, in arms oppos&rsquo;d, with equal horror wounds:<br />
      &ldquo;O Trojan race, your needless aid forbear,<br />
      And know, my ships are my peculiar care.<br />
      With greater ease the bold Rutulian may,<br />
      With hissing brands, attempt to burn the sea,<br />
      Than singe my sacred pines. But you, my charge,<br />
      Loos&rsquo;d from your crooked anchors, launch at large,<br />
      Exalted each a nymph: forsake the sand,<br />
      And swim the seas, at Cybele&rsquo;s command.&rdquo;<br />
      No sooner had the goddess ceas&rsquo;d to speak,<br />
      When, lo! th&rsquo; obedient ships their haulsers break;<br />
      And, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main<br />
      They plunge their prows, and dive, and spring again:<br />
      As many beauteous maids the billows sweep,<br />
      As rode before tall vessels on the deep.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      The foes, surpris&rsquo;d with wonder, stood aghast;<br />
      Messapus curb&rsquo;d his fiery courser&rsquo;s haste;<br />
      Old Tiber roar&rsquo;d, and, raising up his head,<br />
      Call&rsquo;d back his waters to their oozy bed.<br />
      Turnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock,<br />
      And with these words his trembling troops bespoke:<br />
      &ldquo;These monsters for the Trojans&rsquo; fate are meant,<br />
      And are by Jove for black presages sent.<br />
      He takes the cowards&rsquo; last relief away;<br />
      For fly they cannot, and, constrain&rsquo;d to stay,<br />
      Must yield unfought, a base inglorious prey.<br />
      The liquid half of all the globe is lost;<br />
      Heav&rsquo;n shuts the seas, and we secure the coast.<br />
      Theirs is no more than that small spot of ground<br />
      Which myriads of our martial men surround.<br />
      Their fates I fear not, or vain oracles.<br />
      &rsquo;Twas giv&rsquo;n to Venus they should cross the seas,<br />
      And land secure upon the Latian plains:<br />
      Their promis&rsquo;d hour is pass&rsquo;d, and mine remains.<br />
      &rsquo;Tis in the fate of Turnus to destroy,<br />
      With sword and fire, the faithless race of Troy.<br />
      Shall such affronts as these alone inflame<br />
      The Grecian brothers, and the Grecian name?<br />
      My cause and theirs is one; a fatal strife,<br />
      And final ruin, for a ravish&rsquo;d wife.<br />
      Was &rsquo;t not enough, that, punish&rsquo;d for the crime,<br />
      They fell; but will they fall a second time?<br />
      One would have thought they paid enough before,<br />
      To curse the costly sex, and durst offend no more.<br />
      Can they securely trust their feeble wall,<br />
      A slight partition, a thin interval,<br />
      Betwixt their fate and them; when Troy, tho&rsquo; built<br />
      By hands divine, yet perish&rsquo;d by their guilt?<br />
      Lend me, for once, my friends, your valiant hands,<br />
      To force from out their lines these dastard bands.<br />
      Less than a thousand ships will end this war,<br />
      Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare.<br />
      Let all the Tuscans, all th&rsquo; Arcadians, join!<br />
      Nor these, nor those, shall frustrate my design.<br />
      Let them not fear the treasons of the night,<br />
      The robb&rsquo;d Palladium, the pretended flight:<br />
      Our onset shall be made in open light.<br />
      No wooden engine shall their town betray;<br />
      Fires they shall have around, but fires by day.<br />
      No Grecian babes before their camp appear,<br />
      Whom Hector&rsquo;s arms detain&rsquo;d to the tenth tardy year.<br />
      Now, since the sun is rolling to the west,<br />
      Give we the silent night to needful rest:<br />
      Refresh your bodies, and your arms prepare;<br />
      The morn shall end the small remains of war.&rdquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      The post of honour to Messapus falls,<br />
      To keep the nightly guard, to watch the walls,<br />
      To pitch the fires at distances around,<br />
      And close the Trojans in their scanty ground.<br />
      Twice seven Rutulian captains ready stand,<br />
      And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command;<br />
      All clad in shining arms the works invest,<br />
      Each with a radiant helm and waving crest.<br />
      Stretch&rsquo;d at their length, they press the grassy ground;<br />
      They laugh, they sing, (the jolly bowls go round,)<br />
      With lights and cheerful fires renew the day,<br />
      And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      The Trojans, from above, their foes beheld,<br />
      And with arm&rsquo;d legions all the rampires fill&rsquo;d.<br />
      Seiz&rsquo;d with affright, their gates they first explore;<br />
      Join works to works with bridges, tow&rsquo;r to tow&rsquo;r:<br />
      Thus all things needful for defence abound.<br />
      Mnestheus and brave Seresthus walk the round,<br />
      Commission&rsquo;d by their absent prince to share<br />
      The common danger, and divide the care.<br />
      The soldiers draw their lots, and, as they fall,<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance,<br />
      To watch the gate was warlike Nisus&rsquo; chance.<br />
      His father Hyrtacus of noble blood;<br />
      His mother was a huntress of the wood,<br />
      And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear<br />
      His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear,<br />
      But better skill&rsquo;d unerring shafts to send.<br />
      Beside him stood Euryalus, his friend:<br />
      Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host<br />
      No fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast.<br />
      Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun.<br />
      One was their care, and their delight was one:<br />
      One common hazard in the war they shar&rsquo;d,<br />
      And now were both by choice upon the guard.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Then Nisus thus: &ldquo;Or do the gods inspire<br />
      This warmth, or make we gods of our desire?<br />
      A gen&rsquo;rous ardour boils within my breast,<br />
      Eager of action, enemy to rest:<br />
      This urges me to fight, and fires my mind<br />
      To leave a memorable name behind.<br />
      Thou see&rsquo;st the foe secure; how faintly shine<br />
      Their scatter&rsquo;d fires! the most, in sleep supine<br />
      Along the ground, an easy conquest lie:<br />
      The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply;<br />
      All hush&rsquo;d around. Now hear what I revolve&mdash;<br />
      A thought unripe&mdash;and scarcely yet resolve.<br />
      Our absent prince both camp and council mourn;<br />
      By message both would hasten his return:<br />
      If they confer what I demand on thee,<br />
      (For fame is recompense enough for me,)<br />
      Methinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied<br />
      A way that safely will my passage guide.&rdquo;<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Euryalus stood list&rsquo;ning while he spoke,<br />
      With love of praise and noble envy struck;<br />
      Then to his ardent friend expos&rsquo;d his mind:<br />
      &ldquo;All this, alone, and leaving me behind!<br />
      Am I unworthy, Nisus, to be join&rsquo;d?<br />
      Think&rsquo;st thou I can my share of glory yield,<br />
      Or send thee unassisted to the field?<br />
      Not so my father taught my childhood arms;<br />
      Born in a siege, and bred among alarms!<br />
      Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend,<br />
      Nor of the heav&rsquo;n-born hero I attend.<br />
      The thing call&rsquo;d life, with ease I can disclaim,<br />
      And think it over-sold to purchase fame.&rdquo;<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Then Nisus thus: &ldquo;Alas! thy tender years<br />
      Would minister new matter to my fears.<br />
      So may the gods, who view this friendly strife,<br />
      Restore me to thy lov&rsquo;d embrace with life,<br />
      Condemn&rsquo;d to pay my vows, (as sure I trust,)<br />
      This thy request is cruel and unjust.<br />
      But if some chance&mdash;as many chances are,<br />
      And doubtful hazards, in the deeds of war&mdash;<br />
      If one should reach my head, there let it fall,<br />
      And spare thy life; I would not perish all.<br />
      Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date:<br />
      Live thou to mourn thy love&rsquo;s unhappy fate;<br />
      To bear my mangled body from the foe,<br />
      Or buy it back, and fun&rsquo;ral rites bestow.<br />
      Or, if hard fortune shall those dues deny,<br />
      Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply.<br />
      O let not me the widow&rsquo;s tears renew!<br />
      Nor let a mother&rsquo;s curse my name pursue:<br />
      Thy pious parent, who, for love of thee,<br />
      Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily,<br />
      Her age committing to the seas and wind,<br />
      When ev&rsquo;ry weary matron stay&rsquo;d behind.&rdquo;<br />
      To this, Euryalus: &ldquo;You plead in vain,<br />
      And but protract the cause you cannot gain.<br />
      No more delays, but haste!&rdquo; With that, he wakes<br />
      The nodding watch; each to his office takes.<br />
      The guard reliev&rsquo;d, the gen&rsquo;rous couple went<br />
      To find the council at the royal tent.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      All creatures else forgot their daily care,<br />

      In nightly council for th&rsquo; indanger&rsquo;d state.<br />
      They vote a message to their absent chief,<br />
      Shew their distress, and beg a swift relief.<br />
      Amid the camp a silent seat they chose,<br />
      Remote from clamour, and secure from foes.<br />
      On their left arms their ample shields they bear,<br />
      The right reclin&rsquo;d upon the bending spear.<br />
      Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard,<br />
      And beg admission, eager to be heard:<br />
      Th&rsquo; affair important, not to be deferr&rsquo;d.<br />
      Ascanius bids &rsquo;em be conducted in,<br />
      Ord&rsquo;ring the more experienc&rsquo;d to begin.<br />
      Then Nisus thus: &ldquo;Ye fathers, lend your ears;<br />
      Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years.<br />
      The foe, securely drench&rsquo;d in sleep and wine,<br />
      Neglect their watch; the fires but thinly shine;<br />
      And where the smoke in cloudy vapours flies,<br />
      Cov&rsquo;ring the plain, and curling to the skies,<br />
      Betwixt two paths, which at the gate divide,<br />
      Close by the sea, a passage we have spied,<br />
      Which will our way to great Aeneas guide.<br />
      Expect each hour to see him safe again,<br />
      Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain.<br />
      Snatch we the lucky minute while we may;<br />
      Nor can we be mistaken in the way;<br />
      For, hunting in the vale, we both have seen<br />
      The rising turrets, and the stream between,<br />
      And know the winding course, with ev&rsquo;ry ford.&rdquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      He ceas&rsquo;d; and old Alethes took the word:<br />

      Then into tears of joy the father broke;<br />
      Each in his longing arms by turns he took;<br />

      In recompense of such desert, decree?<br />
      The greatest, sure, and best you can receive,<br />
      The gods and your own conscious worth will give.<br />

      And high emboss&rsquo;d, which, when old Priam reign&rsquo;d,<br />
      My conqu&rsquo;ring sire at sack&rsquo;d Arisba gain&rsquo;d;<br />
      And more, two tripods cast in antique mould,<br />
      With two great talents of the finest gold;<br />
      Beside a costly bowl, ingrav&rsquo;d with art,<br />
      Which Dido gave, when first she gave her heart.<br />

      Twelve lab&rsquo;ring slaves, twelve handmaids young and fair<br />
      All clad in rich attire, and train&rsquo;d with care;<br />
      And, last, a Latian field with fruitful plains,<br />
      And a large portion of the king&rsquo;s domains.<br />

      Of Priam&rsquo;s royal race my mother came&mdash;<br />
      And sure the best that ever bore the name&mdash;<br />
      Whom neither Troy nor Sicily could hold<br />
      From me departing, but, o&rsquo;erspent and old,<br />
      My fate she follow&rsquo;d. Ignorant of this<br />
      (Whatever) danger, neither parting kiss,<br />
      Nor pious blessing taken, her I leave,<br />
      And in this only act of all my life deceive.<br />
      By this right hand and conscious night I swear,<br />
      My soul so sad a farewell could not bear.<br />
      Be you her comfort; fill my vacant place<br />

    <p class="poem">
      He said, and weeping, while he spoke the word,<br />

      Magnificent with gold. Lycaon made,<br />

      A king and prophet, by King Turnus lov&rsquo;d:<br />
      But fate by prescience cannot be remov&rsquo;d.<br />
      Him and his sleeping slaves he slew; then spies<br />
      Where Remus, with his rich retinue, lies.<br />
      His armour-bearer first, and next he kills<br />
      His charioteer, intrench&rsquo;d betwixt the wheels<br />
      And his lov&rsquo;d horses; last invades their lord;<br />
      Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword:<br />
      The gasping head flies off; a purple flood<br />
      Flows from the trunk, that welters in the blood,<br />
      Which, by the spurning heels dispers&rsquo;d around,<br />
      The bed besprinkles and bedews the ground.<br />
      Lamus the bold, and Lamyrus the strong,<br />
      He slew, and then Serranus fair and young.<br />
      From dice and wine the youth retir&rsquo;d to rest,<br />
      And puff&rsquo;d the fumy god from out his breast:<br />
      Ev&rsquo;n then he dreamt of drink and lucky play&mdash;<br />
      More lucky, had it lasted till the day.<br />
      The famish&rsquo;d lion thus, with hunger bold,<br />
      O&rsquo;erleaps the fences of the nightly fold,<br />

      The girdle-belt, with nails of burnish&rsquo;d gold.<br />
      This present Caedicus the rich bestow&rsquo;d<br />
      On Remulus, when friendship first they vow&rsquo;d,<br />
      And, absent, join&rsquo;d in hospitable ties:<br />
      He, dying, to his heir bequeath&rsquo;d the prize;<br />
      Till, by the conqu&rsquo;ring Ardean troops oppress&rsquo;d,<br />
      He fell; and they the glorious gift possess&rsquo;d.<br />
      These glitt&rsquo;ring spoils (now made the victor&rsquo;s gain)<br />
      He to his body suits, but suits in vain:<br />
      Messapus&rsquo; helm he finds among the rest,<br />
      And laces on, and wears the waving crest.<br />
      Proud of their conquest, prouder of their prey,<br />
      They leave the camp, and take the ready way.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      But far they had not pass&rsquo;d, before they spied<br />
      Three hundred horse, with Volscens for their guide.<br />
      The queen a legion to King Turnus sent;<br />
      But the swift horse the slower foot prevent,<br />
      And now, advancing, sought the leader&rsquo;s tent.<br />
      They saw the pair; for, thro&rsquo; the doubtful shade,<br />
      His shining helm Euryalus betray&rsquo;d,<br />
      On which the moon with full reflection play&rsquo;d.<br />
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not for naught,&rdquo; cried Volscens from the crowd,<br />
      &ldquo;These men go there;&rdquo; then rais&rsquo;d his voice aloud:<br />
      &ldquo;Stand! stand! why thus in arms? And whither bent?<br />
      From whence, to whom, and on what errand sent?&rdquo;<br />
      Silent they scud away, and haste their flight<br />
      To neighb&rsquo;ring woods, and trust themselves to night.<br />
      The speedy horse all passages belay,<br />
      And spur their smoking steeds to cross their way,<br />
      And watch each entrance of the winding wood.<br />
      Black was the forest: thick with beech it stood,<br />
      Horrid with fern, and intricate with thorn;<br />
      Few paths of human feet, or tracks of beasts, were worn.<br />
      The darkness of the shades, his heavy prey,<br />
      And fear, misled the younger from his way.<br />
      But Nisus hit the turns with happier haste,<br />
      And, thoughtless of his friend, the forest pass&rsquo;d,<br />
      And Alban plains, from Alba&rsquo;s name so call&rsquo;d,<br />
      Where King Latinus then his oxen stall&rsquo;d;<br />
      Till, turning at the length, he stood his ground,<br />
      And miss&rsquo;d his friend, and cast his eyes around:<br />
      &ldquo;Ah wretch!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;where have I left behind<br />
      Th&rsquo; unhappy youth? where shall I hope to find?<br />
      Or what way take?&rdquo; Again he ventures back,<br />
      And treads the mazes of his former track.<br />
      He winds the wood, and, list&rsquo;ning, hears the noise<br />
      Of tramping coursers, and the riders&rsquo; voice.<br />
      The sound approach&rsquo;d; and suddenly he view&rsquo;d<br />
      The foes inclosing, and his friend pursued,<br />
      Forelaid and taken, while he strove in vain<br />
      The shelter of the friendly shades to gain.<br />
      What should he next attempt? what arms employ,<br />
      What fruitless force, to free the captive boy?<br />
      Or desperate should he rush and lose his life,<br />
      With odds oppress&rsquo;d, in such unequal strife?<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Resolv&rsquo;d at length, his pointed spear he shook;<br />
      And, casting on the moon a mournful look:<br />
      &ldquo;Guardian of groves, and goddess of the night,<br />
      Fair queen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;direct my dart aright.<br />
      If e&rsquo;er my pious father, for my sake,<br />
      Did grateful off&rsquo;rings on thy altars make,<br />
      Or I increas&rsquo;d them with my sylvan toils,<br />
      And hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils,<br />
      Give me to scatter these.&rdquo; Then from his ear<br />
      He pois&rsquo;d, and aim&rsquo;d, and launch&rsquo;d the trembling spear.<br />
      The deadly weapon, hissing from the grove,<br />
      Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove;<br />
      Pierc&rsquo;d his thin armour, drank his vital blood,<br />
      And in his body left the broken wood.<br />
      He staggers round; his eyeballs roll in death,<br />
      And with short sobs he gasps away his breath.<br />
      All stand amaz&rsquo;d&mdash;a second jav&rsquo;lin flies<br />
      With equal strength, and quivers thro&rsquo; the skies.<br />
      This thro&rsquo; thy temples, Tagus, forc&rsquo;d the way,<br />
      And in the brainpan warmly buried lay.<br />
      Fierce Volscens foams with rage, and, gazing round,<br />
      Descried not him who gave the fatal wound,<br />
      Nor knew to fix revenge: &ldquo;But thou,&rdquo; he cries,<br />
      &ldquo;Shalt pay for both,&rdquo; and at the pris&rsquo;ner flies<br />
      With his drawn sword. Then, struck with deep despair,<br />
      That cruel sight the lover could not bear;<br />
      But from his covert rush&rsquo;d in open view,<br />
      And sent his voice before him as he flew:<br />
      &ldquo;Me! me!&rdquo; he cried&mdash;&ldquo;turn all your swords alone<br />
      On me&mdash;the fact confess&rsquo;d, the fault my own.<br />
      He neither could nor durst, the guiltless youth:<br />
      Ye moon and stars, bear witness to the truth!<br />
      His only crime (if friendship can offend)<br />
      Is too much love to his unhappy friend.&rdquo;<br />
      Too late he speaks: the sword, which fury guides,<br />
      Driv&rsquo;n with full force, had pierc&rsquo;d his tender sides.<br />
      Down fell the beauteous youth: the yawning wound<br />
      Gush&rsquo;d out a purple stream, and stain&rsquo;d the ground.<br />
      His snowy neck reclines upon his breast,<br />
      Like a fair flow&rsquo;r by the keen share oppress&rsquo;d;<br />
      Like a white poppy sinking on the plain,<br />
      Whose heavy head is overcharg&rsquo;d with rain.<br />
      Despair, and rage, and vengeance justly vow&rsquo;d,<br />
      Drove Nisus headlong on the hostile crowd.<br />
      Volscens he seeks; on him alone he bends:<br />
      Borne back and bor&rsquo;d by his surrounding friends,<br />
      Onward he press&rsquo;d, and kept him still in sight;<br />
      Then whirl&rsquo;d aloft his sword with all his might:<br />
      Th&rsquo; unerring steel descended while he spoke,<br />
      Pierc&rsquo;d his wide mouth, and thro&rsquo; his weazon broke.<br />
      Dying, he slew; and, stagg&rsquo;ring on the plain,<br />
      With swimming eyes he sought his lover slain;<br />
      Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell,<br />
      Content, in death, to be reveng&rsquo;d so well.<br />

      Meantime the Trojans run, where danger calls;<br />
      They line their trenches, and they man their walls.<br />
      In front extended to the left they stood;<br />
      Safe was the right, surrounded by the flood.<br />
      But, casting from their tow&rsquo;rs a frightful view,<br />

      Tho&rsquo; then disguis&rsquo;d in death, and smear&rsquo;d all o&rsquo;er<br />
      With filth obscene, and dropping putrid gore.<br />
      Soon hasty fame thro&rsquo; the sad city bears<br />
      The mournful message to the mother&rsquo;s ears.<br />

      Her cheeks the blood, her hand the web forsakes.<br />
      She runs the rampires round amidst the war,<br />

      To wash his wounds, to weep his obsequies,<br />
      To call about his corpse his crying friends,<br />
      Or spread the mantle (made for other ends)<br />
      On his dear body, which I wove with care,<br />
      Nor did my daily pains or nightly labour spare.<br />

      His trunk dismember&rsquo;d, and his cold remains?<br />
      For this, alas! I left my needful ease,<br />

      And almost join&rsquo;d the horns of the tough yew.<br />
      But, first, before the throne of Jove he stood,<br />
      And thus with lifted hands invok&rsquo;d the god:<br />
      &ldquo;My first attempt, great Jupiter, succeed!<br />
      An annual off&rsquo;ring in thy grove shall bleed;<br />
      A snow-white steer, before thy altar led,<br />
      Who, like his mother, bears aloft his head,<br />
      Butts with his threat&rsquo;ning brows, and bellowing stands,<br />
      And dares the fight, and spurns the yellow sands.&rdquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Jove bow&rsquo;d the heav&rsquo;ns, and lent a gracious ear,<br />
      And thunder&rsquo;d on the left, amidst the clear.<br />
      Sounded at once the bow; and swiftly flies<br />
      The feather&rsquo;d death, and hisses thro&rsquo; the skies.<br />
      The steel thro&rsquo; both his temples forc&rsquo;d the way:<br />
      Extended on the ground, Numanus lay.<br />
      &ldquo;Go now, vain boaster, and true valour scorn!<br />
      The Phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third return.&rdquo;<br />
      Ascanius said no more. The Trojans shake<br />
      The heav&rsquo;ns with shouting, and new vigour take.<br />

      Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud,<br />
      To view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd;<br />

      To thee, to them, and their victorious heirs,<br />
      The conquer&rsquo;d war is due, and the vast world is theirs.<br />
      Troy is too narrow for thy name.&rdquo; He said,<br />
      And plunging downward shot his radiant head;<br />
      Dispell&rsquo;d the breathing air, that broke his flight:<br />
      Shorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight.<br />
      Old Butes&rsquo; form he took, Anchises&rsquo; squire,<br />
      Now left, to rule Ascanius, by his sire:<br />
      His wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs,<br />
      His mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears,<br />
      And thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years:<br />
      &ldquo;Suffice it thee, thy father&rsquo;s worthy son,<br />
      The warlike prize thou hast already won.<br />
      The god of archers gives thy youth a part<br />
      Of his own praise, nor envies equal art.<br />
      Now tempt the war no more.&rdquo; He said, and flew<br />
      Obscure in air, and vanish&rsquo;d from their view.<br />
      The Trojans, by his arms, their patron know,<br />
      And hear the twanging of his heav&rsquo;nly bow.<br />
      Then duteous force they use, and Phoebus&rsquo; name,<br />
      To keep from fight the youth too fond of fame.<br />
      Undaunted, they themselves no danger shun;<br />
      From wall to wall the shouts and clamours run.<br />
      They bend their bows; they whirl their slings around;<br />
      Heaps of spent arrows fall, and strew the ground;<br />
      And helms, and shields, and rattling arms resound.<br />
      The combat thickens, like the storm that flies<br />
      From westward, when the show&rsquo;ry Kids arise;<br />
      Or patt&rsquo;ring hail comes pouring on the main,<br />
      When Jupiter descends in harden&rsquo;d rain,<br />
      Or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound,<br />
      And with an armed winter strew the ground.<br />

      Down sunk the monster bulk and press&rsquo;d the ground;<br />
      His arms and clatt&rsquo;ring shield on the vast body sound,<br />
      Not with less ruin than the Bajan mole,<br />

    <h5> THE ARGUMENT. </h5>

    <p>
      Jupiter, calling a council of the gods, forbids them to engage in either party.
      At Aeneas&rsquo; return there is a bloody battle: Turnus killing Pallas;
      Aeneas, Lausus, and Mezentius. Mezentius is described as an atheist; Lausus
      as a pious and virtuous youth. The different actions and death of these two
      are the subject of a noble episode.

      With war unhop&rsquo;d the Latians to surprise?<br />
      By fate, you boast, and by the gods&rsquo; decree,<br />
      He left his native land for Italy!<br />
      Confess the truth; by mad Cassandra, more<br />
      Than Heav&rsquo;n inspir&rsquo;d, he sought a foreign shore!<br />
      Did I persuade to trust his second Troy<br />
      To the raw conduct of a beardless boy,<br />
      With walls unfinish&rsquo;d, which himself forsakes,<br />
      And thro&rsquo; the waves a wand&rsquo;ring voyage takes?<br />
      When have I urg&rsquo;d him meanly to demand<br />
      The Tuscan aid, and arm a quiet land?<br />
      Did I or Iris give this mad advice,<br />
      Or made the fool himself the fatal choice?<br />
      You think it hard, the Latians should destroy<br />
      With swords your Trojans, and with fires your Troy!<br />
      Hard and unjust indeed, for men to draw<br />
      Their native air, nor take a foreign law!<br />
      That Turnus is permitted still to live,<br />
      To whom his birth a god and goddess give!<br />
      But yet is just and lawful for your line<br />
      To drive their fields, and force with fraud to join;<br />
      Realms, not your own, among your clans divide,<br />
      And from the bridegroom tear the promis&rsquo;d bride;<br />
      Petition, while you public arms prepare;<br />
      Pretend a peace, and yet provoke a war!<br />
      &rsquo;Twas giv&rsquo;n to you, your darling son to shroud,<br />

      If she presume to save her suff&rsquo;ring friends!<br />
      Your son, not knowing what his foes decree,<br />
      You say, is absent: absent let him be.<br />
      Yours is Cythera, yours the Cyprian tow&rsquo;rs,<br />
      The soft recesses, and the sacred bow&rsquo;rs.<br />
      Why do you then these needless arms prepare,<br />
      And thus provoke a people prone to war?<br />
      Did I with fire the Trojan town deface,<br />
      Or hinder from return your exil&rsquo;d race?<br />
      Was I the cause of mischief, or the man<br />
      Whose lawless lust the fatal war began?<br />
      Think on whose faith th&rsquo; adult&rsquo;rous youth relied;<br />

      When all th&rsquo; united states of Greece combin&rsquo;d,<br />

      With mutual blood th&rsquo; Ausonian soil is dyed,<br />
      While on its borders each their claim decide.<br />
      As wintry winds, contending in the sky,<br />
      With equal force of lungs their titles try:<br />
      They rage, they roar; the doubtful rack of heav&rsquo;n<br />
      Stands without motion, and the tide undriv&rsquo;n:<br />
      Each bent to conquer, neither side to yield,<br />

      Laris and Thymbrus, on the Latian plain;<br />
      So wondrous like in feature, shape, and size,<br />
      As caus&rsquo;d an error in their parents&rsquo; eyes&mdash;<br />
      Grateful mistake! but soon the sword decides<br />
      The nice distinction, and their fate divides:<br />
      For Thymbrus&rsquo; head was lopp&rsquo;d; and Laris&rsquo; hand,<br />
      Dismember&rsquo;d, sought its owner on the strand:<br />

      To scape from hence, as from the Trojan plain:<br />
      Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode,<br />
      Nor this the chariot where Achilles rode;<br />
      Nor Venus&rsquo; veil is here, near Neptune&rsquo;s shield;<br />
      Thy fatal hour is come, and this the field.&rdquo;<br />
      Thus Liger vainly vaunts: the Trojan peer<br />
      Return&rsquo;d his answer with his flying spear.<br />
      As Lucagus, to lash his horses, bends,<br />
      Prone to the wheels, and his left foot protends,<br />
      Prepar&rsquo;d for fight; the fatal dart arrives,<br />
      And thro&rsquo; the borders of his buckler drives;<br />
      Pass&rsquo;d thro&rsquo; and pierc&rsquo;d his groin: the deadly wound,<br />
      Cast from his chariot, roll&rsquo;d him on the ground.<br />
      Whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite:<br />
      &ldquo;Blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight;<br />
      Vain shadows did not force their swift retreat;<br />
      But you yourself forsake your empty seat.&rdquo;<br />
      He said, and seiz&rsquo;d at once the loosen&rsquo;d rein;<br />
      For Liger lay already on the plain,<br />
      By the same shock: then, stretching out his hands,<br />
      The recreant thus his wretched life demands:<br />
      &ldquo;Now, by thyself, O more than mortal man!<br />
      By her and him from whom thy breath began,<br />
      Who form&rsquo;d thee thus divine, I beg thee, spare<br />
      This forfeit life, and hear thy suppliant&rsquo;s pray&rsquo;r.&rdquo;<br />
      Thus much he spoke, and more he would have said;<br />
      But the stern hero turn&rsquo;d aside his head,<br />
      And cut him short: &ldquo;I hear another man;<br />
      You talk&rsquo;d not thus before the fight began.<br />
      Now take your turn; and, as a brother should,<br />
      Attend your brother to the Stygian flood.&rdquo;<br />
      Then thro&rsquo; his breast his fatal sword he sent,<br />
      And the soul issued at the gaping vent.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      As storms the skies, and torrents tear the ground,<br />
      Thus rag&rsquo;d the prince, and scatter&rsquo;d deaths around.<br />
      At length Ascanius and the Trojan train<br />
      Broke from the camp, so long besieg&rsquo;d in vain.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Meantime the King of Gods and Mortal Man<br />
      Held conference with his queen, and thus began:<br />
      &ldquo;My sister goddess, and well-pleasing wife,<br />
      Still think you Venus&rsquo; aid supports the strife&mdash;<br />
      Sustains her Trojans&mdash;or themselves, alone,<br />
      With inborn valour force their fortune on?<br />
      How fierce in fight, with courage undecay&rsquo;d!<br />
      Judge if such warriors want immortal aid.&rdquo;<br />
      To whom the goddess with the charming eyes,<br />
      Soft in her tone, submissively replies:<br />
      &ldquo;Why, O my sov&rsquo;reign lord, whose frown I fear,<br />
      And cannot, unconcern&rsquo;d, your anger bear;<br />
      Why urge you thus my grief? when, if I still<br />
      (As once I was) were mistress of your will,<br />
      From your almighty pow&rsquo;r your pleasing wife<br />
      Might gain the grace of length&rsquo;ning Turnus&rsquo; life,<br />
      Securely snatch him from the fatal fight,<br />
      And give him to his aged father&rsquo;s sight.<br />
      Now let him perish, since you hold it good,<br />
      And glut the Trojans with his pious blood.<br />
      Yet from our lineage he derives his name,<br />
      And, in the fourth degree, from god Pilumnus came;<br />
      Yet he devoutly pays you rites divine,<br />
      And offers daily incense at your shrine.&rdquo;<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Then shortly thus the sov&rsquo;reign god replied:<br />
      &ldquo;Since in my pow&rsquo;r and goodness you confide,<br />
      If for a little space, a lengthen&rsquo;d span,<br />
      You beg reprieve for this expiring man,<br />
      I grant you leave to take your Turnus hence<br />
      From instant fate, and can so far dispense.<br />
      But, if some secret meaning lies beneath,<br />
      To save the short-liv&rsquo;d youth from destin&rsquo;d death,<br />
      Or if a farther thought you entertain,<br />
      To change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain.&rdquo;<br />
      To whom the goddess thus, with weeping eyes:<br />
      &ldquo;And what if that request, your tongue denies,<br />
      Your heart should grant; and not a short reprieve,<br />
      But length of certain life, to Turnus give?<br />
      Now speedy death attends the guiltless youth,<br />
      If my presaging soul divines with truth;<br />
      Which, O! I wish, might err thro&rsquo; causeless fears,<br />
      And you (for you have pow&rsquo;r) prolong his years!&rdquo;<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Thus having said, involv&rsquo;d in clouds, she flies,<br />
      And drives a storm before her thro&rsquo; the skies.<br />
      Swift she descends, alighting on the plain,<br />
      Where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain.<br />
      Of air condens&rsquo;d a spectre soon she made;<br />
      And, what Aeneas was, such seem&rsquo;d the shade.<br />
      Adorn&rsquo;d with Dardan arms, the phantom bore<br />
      His head aloft; a plumy crest he wore;<br />
      This hand appear&rsquo;d a shining sword to wield,<br />
      And that sustain&rsquo;d an imitated shield.<br />
      With manly mien he stalk&rsquo;d along the ground,<br />
      Nor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting sound.<br />
      (Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight,<br />
      Or dreadful visions in our dreams by night.)<br />
      The spectre seems the Daunian chief to dare,<br />
      And flourishes his empty sword in air.<br />
      At this, advancing, Turnus hurl&rsquo;d his spear:<br />
      The phantom wheel&rsquo;d, and seem&rsquo;d to fly for fear.<br />
      Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled,<br />
      And with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed.<br />
      &ldquo;Whether, O coward?&rdquo; (thus he calls aloud,<br />
      Nor found he spoke to wind, and chas&rsquo;d a cloud,)<br />
      &ldquo;Why thus forsake your bride! Receive from me<br />
      The fated land you sought so long by sea.&rdquo;<br />
      He said, and, brandishing at once his blade,<br />
      With eager pace pursued the flying shade.<br />
      By chance a ship was fasten&rsquo;d to the shore,<br />
      Which from old Clusium King Osinius bore:<br />
      The plank was ready laid for safe ascent;<br />
      For shelter there the trembling shadow bent,<br />
      And skipp&rsquo;t and skulk&rsquo;d, and under hatches went.<br />
      Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste,<br />
      Ascends the plank, and to the galley pass&rsquo;d.<br />
      Scarce had he reach&rsquo;d the prow: Saturnia&rsquo;s hand<br />
      The haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land.<br />
      With wind in poop, the vessel plows the sea,<br />
      And measures back with speed her former way.<br />
      Meantime Aeneas seeks his absent foe,<br />
      And sends his slaughter&rsquo;d troops to shades below.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud,<br />
      And flew sublime, and vanish&rsquo;d in a cloud.<br />
      Too late young Turnus the delusion found,<br />
      Far on the sea, still making from the ground.<br />
      Then, thankless for a life redeem&rsquo;d by shame,<br />
      With sense of honour stung, and forfeit fame,<br />
      Fearful besides of what in fight had pass&rsquo;d,<br />
      His hands and haggard eyes to heav&rsquo;n he cast;<br />
      &ldquo;O Jove!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;for what offence have I<br />
      Deserv&rsquo;d to bear this endless infamy?<br />
      Whence am I forc&rsquo;d, and whether am I borne?<br />
      How, and with what reproach, shall I return?<br />
      Shall ever I behold the Latian plain,<br />
      Or see Laurentum&rsquo;s lofty tow&rsquo;rs again?<br />
      What will they say of their deserting chief<br />
      The war was mine: I fly from their relief;<br />
      I led to slaughter, and in slaughter leave;<br />
      And ev&rsquo;n from hence their dying groans receive.<br />
      Here, overmatch&rsquo;d in fight, in heaps they lie;<br />
      There, scatter&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er the fields, ignobly fly.<br />
      Gape wide, O earth, and draw me down alive!<br />
      Or, O ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve!<br />
      On sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive;<br />
      Or set me shipwreck&rsquo;d on some desert shore,<br />
      Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more,<br />
      Unknown to friends, or foes, or conscious Fame,<br />
      Lest she should follow, and my flight proclaim.&rdquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Thus Turnus rav&rsquo;d, and various fates revolv&rsquo;d:<br />
      The choice was doubtful, but the death resolv&rsquo;d.<br />
      And now the sword, and now the sea took place,<br />
      That to revenge, and this to purge disgrace.<br />
      Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main,<br />
      By stretch of arms the distant shore to gain.<br />
      Thrice he the sword assay&rsquo;d, and thrice the flood;<br />
      But Juno, mov&rsquo;d with pity, both withstood.<br />
      And thrice repress&rsquo;d his rage; strong gales supplied,<br />

      At length she lands him on his native shores,<br />

      From Coritus came Acron to the fight,<br />

      Proud of the purple favours of his bride.<br />
      Then, as a hungry lion, who beholds<br />
      A gamesome goat, who frisks about the folds,<br />
      Or beamy stag, that grazes on the plain&mdash;<br />
      He runs, he roars, he shakes his rising mane,<br />
      He grins, and opens wide his greedy jaws;<br />
      The prey lies panting underneath his paws:<br />
      He fills his famish&rsquo;d maw; his mouth runs o&rsquo;er<br />
      With unchew&rsquo;d morsels, while he churns the gore:<br />
      So proud Mezentius rushes on his foes,<br />
      And first unhappy Acron overthrows:<br />
      Stretch&rsquo;d at his length, he spurns the swarthy ground;<br />

      Orodes flying, nor the wretch pursued,<br />
      Nor thought the dastard&rsquo;s back deserv&rsquo;d a wound,<br />

      Then turning short, he met him face to face,<br />

      Orodes falls, in equal fight oppress&rsquo;d:<br />

      &ldquo;Nor thou, proud man, unpunish&rsquo;d shalt remain:<br />
      Like death attends thee on this fatal plain.&rdquo;<br />

      Thy body on thy parents I bestow,<br />
      To rest thy soul, at least, if shadows know,<br />
      Or have a sense of human things below.<br />
      There to thy fellow ghosts with glory tell:<br />
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Twas by the great Aeneas hand I fell.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br />
      With this, his distant friends he beckons near,<br />
      Provokes their duty, and prevents their fear:<br />
      Himself assists to lift him from the ground,<br />
      With clotted locks, and blood that well&rsquo;d from out the wound.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Meantime, his father, now no father, stood,<br />
      And wash&rsquo;d his wounds by Tiber&rsquo;s yellow flood:<br />
      Oppress&rsquo;d with anguish, panting, and o&rsquo;erspent,<br />
      His fainting limbs against an oak he leant.<br />
      A bough his brazen helmet did sustain;<br />
      His heavier arms lay scatter&rsquo;d on the plain:<br />
      A chosen train of youth around him stand;<br />
      His drooping head was rested on his hand:<br />
      His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought;<br />
      And all on Lausus ran his restless thought.<br />
      Careful, concern&rsquo;d his danger to prevent,<br />
      He much enquir&rsquo;d, and many a message sent<br />
      To warn him from the field&mdash;alas! in vain!<br />
      Behold, his mournful followers bear him slain!<br />
      O&rsquo;er his broad shield still gush&rsquo;d the yawning wound,<br />
      And drew a bloody trail along the ground.<br />
      Far off he heard their cries, far off divin&rsquo;d<br />
      The dire event, with a foreboding mind.<br />
      With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head;<br />
      Then both his lifted hands to heav&rsquo;n he spread;<br />
      Last, the dear corpse embracing, thus he said:<br />
      &ldquo;What joys, alas! could this frail being give,<br />
      That I have been so covetous to live?<br />
      To see my son, and such a son, resign<br />
      His life, a ransom for preserving mine!<br />
      And am I then preserv&rsquo;d, and art thou lost?<br />
      How much too dear has that redemption cost!<br />
      &rsquo;Tis now my bitter banishment I feel:<br />
      This is a wound too deep for time to heal.<br />
      My guilt thy growing virtues did defame;<br />
      My blackness blotted thy unblemish&rsquo;d name.<br />
      Chas&rsquo;d from a throne, abandon&rsquo;d, and exil&rsquo;d<br />
      For foul misdeeds, were punishments too mild:<br />
      I ow&rsquo;d my people these, and, from their hate,<br />
      With less resentment could have borne my fate.<br />
      And yet I live, and yet sustain the sight<br />
      Of hated men, and of more hated light:<br />
      But will not long.&rdquo; With that he rais&rsquo;d from ground<br />
      His fainting limbs, that stagger&rsquo;d with his wound;<br />
      Yet, with a mind resolv&rsquo;d, and unappall&rsquo;d<br />
      With pains or perils, for his courser call&rsquo;d<br />
      Well-mouth&rsquo;d, well-manag&rsquo;d, whom himself did dress<br />
      With daily care, and mounted with success;<br />
      His aid in arms, his ornament in peace.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke,<br />
      The steed seem&rsquo;d sensible, while thus he spoke:<br />
      &ldquo;O Rhoebus, we have liv&rsquo;d too long for me&mdash;<br />
      If life and long were terms that could agree!<br />
      This day thou either shalt bring back the head<br />
      And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead;<br />
      This day thou either shalt revenge my woe,<br />
      For murder&rsquo;d Lausus, on his cruel foe;<br />
      Or, if inexorable fate deny<br />
      Our conquest, with thy conquer&rsquo;d master die:<br />
      For, after such a lord, I rest secure,<br />
      Thou wilt no foreign reins, or Trojan load endure.&rdquo;<br />
      He said; and straight th&rsquo; officious courser kneels,<br />
      To take his wonted weight. His hands he fills<br />
      With pointed jav&rsquo;lins; on his head he lac&rsquo;d<br />
      His glitt&rsquo;ring helm, which terribly was grac&rsquo;d<br />
      With waving horsehair, nodding from afar;<br />
      Then spurr&rsquo;d his thund&rsquo;ring steed amidst the war.<br />
      Love, anguish, wrath, and grief, to madness wrought,<br />
      Despair, and secret shame, and conscious thought<br />
      Of inborn worth, his lab&rsquo;ring soul oppress&rsquo;d,<br />
      Roll&rsquo;d in his eyes, and rag&rsquo;d within his breast.<br />
      Then loud he call&rsquo;d Aeneas thrice by name:<br />
      The loud repeated voice to glad Aeneas came.<br />
      &ldquo;Great Jove,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and the far-shooting god,<br />
      Inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good!&rdquo;<br />
      He spoke no more; but hasten&rsquo;d, void of fear,<br />
      And threaten&rsquo;d with his long protended spear.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      To whom Mezentius thus: &ldquo;Thy vaunts are vain.<br />

      The wretched sire is murder&rsquo;d in the son.<br />
      Nor fate I fear, but all the gods defy.<br />
      Forbear thy threats: my bus&rsquo;ness is to die;<br />
      But first receive this parting legacy.&rdquo;<br />
      He said; and straight a whirling dart he sent;<br />
      Another after, and another went.<br />
      Round in a spacious ring he rides the field,<br />
      And vainly plies th&rsquo; impenetrable shield.<br />
      Thrice rode he round; and thrice Aeneas wheel&rsquo;d,<br />
      Turn&rsquo;d as he turn&rsquo;d: the golden orb withstood<br />
      The strokes, and bore about an iron wood.<br />
      Impatient of delay, and weary grown,<br />
      Still to defend, and to defend alone,<br />
      To wrench the darts which in his buckler light,<br />
      Urg&rsquo;d and o&rsquo;er-labour&rsquo;d in unequal fight;<br />
      At length resolv&rsquo;d, he throws with all his force<br />
      Full at the temples of the warrior horse.<br />
      Just where the stroke was aim&rsquo;d, th&rsquo; unerring spear<br />
      Made way, and stood transfix&rsquo;d thro&rsquo; either ear.<br />
      Seiz&rsquo;d with unwonted pain, surpris&rsquo;d with fright,<br />
      The wounded steed curvets, and, rais&rsquo;d upright,<br />
      Lights on his feet before; his hoofs behind<br />
      Spring up in air aloft, and lash the wind.<br />
      Down comes the rider headlong from his height:<br />
      His horse came after with unwieldy weight,<br />
      And, flound&rsquo;ring forward, pitching on his head,<br />
      His lord&rsquo;s encumber&rsquo;d shoulder overlaid.<br />

      From either host, the mingled shouts and cries<br />

      High o&rsquo;er his head, with this reproachful word:<br />
      &ldquo;Now; where are now thy vaunts, the fierce disdain<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Struggling, and wildly staring on the skies,<br />

    <h5> THE ARGUMENT. </h5>

    <p>
      Aeneas erects a trophy of the spoils of Mezentius, grants a truce for
      burying the dead, and sends home the body of Pallas with great solemnity.
      Latinus calls a council, to propose offers of peace to Aeneas; which
      occasions great animosity betwixt Turnus and Drances. In the mean time
      there is a sharp engagement of the horse; wherein Camilla signalizes
      herself, is killed, and the Latine troops are entirely defeated.

      He bar&rsquo;d an ancient oak of all her boughs;<br />
      Then on a rising ground the trunk he plac&rsquo;d,<br />

      Fear is no more, for fierce Mezentius lies,<br />
      As the first fruits of war, a sacrifice.<br />

      Meantime the rites and fun&rsquo;ral pomps prepare,<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way,<br />
      Where, new in death, lamented Pallas lay.<br />
      Acoetes watch&rsquo;d the corpse; whose youth deserv&rsquo;d<br />
      The father&rsquo;s trust; and now the son he serv&rsquo;d<br />
      With equal faith, but less auspicious care.<br />
      Th&rsquo; attendants of the slain his sorrow share.<br />
      A troop of Trojans mix&rsquo;d with these appear,<br />
      And mourning matrons with dishevel&rsquo;d hair.<br />
      Soon as the prince appears, they raise a cry;<br />
      All beat their breasts, and echoes rend the sky.<br />
      They rear his drooping forehead from the ground;<br />
      But, when Aeneas view&rsquo;d the grisly wound<br />
      Which Pallas in his manly bosom bore,<br />
      And the fair flesh distain&rsquo;d with purple gore;<br />
      First, melting into tears, the pious man<br />
      Deplor&rsquo;d so sad a sight, then thus began:<br />
      &ldquo;Unhappy youth! when Fortune gave the rest<br />
      Of my full wishes, she refus&rsquo;d the best!<br />
      She came; but brought not thee along, to bless<br />
      My longing eyes, and share in my success:<br />
      She grudg&rsquo;d thy safe return, the triumphs due<br />
      To prosp&rsquo;rous valour, in the public view.<br />
      Not thus I promis&rsquo;d, when thy father lent<br />
      Thy needless succour with a sad consent;<br />
      Embrac&rsquo;d me, parting for th&rsquo; Etrurian land,<br />
      And sent me to possess a large command.<br />
      He warn&rsquo;d, and from his own experience told,<br />
      Our foes were warlike, disciplin&rsquo;d, and bold.<br />
      And now perhaps, in hopes of thy return,<br />
      Rich odors on his loaded altars burn,<br />
      While we, with vain officious pomp, prepare<br />
      To send him back his portion of the war,<br />
      A bloody breathless body, which can owe<br />
      No farther debt, but to the pow&rsquo;rs below.<br />
      The wretched father, ere his race is run,<br />
      Shall view the fun&rsquo;ral honours of his son.<br />
      These are my triumphs of the Latian war,<br />
      Fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care!<br />
      And yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see<br />
      A son whose death disgrac&rsquo;d his ancestry;<br />
      Thou shalt not blush, old man, however griev&rsquo;d:<br />
      Thy Pallas no dishonest wound receiv&rsquo;d.<br />
      He died no death to make thee wish, too late,<br />
      Thou hadst not liv&rsquo;d to see his shameful fate:<br />
      But what a champion has th&rsquo; Ausonian coast,<br />
      And what a friend hast thou, Ascanius, lost!&rdquo;<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Thus having mourn&rsquo;d, he gave the word around,<br />
      To raise the breathless body from the ground;<br />
      And chose a thousand horse, the flow&rsquo;r of all<br />
      His warlike troops, to wait the funeral,<br />
      To bear him back and share Evander&rsquo;s grief:<br />
      A well-becoming, but a weak relief.<br />
      Of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier,<br />
      Then on their shoulders the sad burden rear.<br />
      The body on this rural hearse is borne:<br />
      Strew&rsquo;d leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn.<br />
      All pale he lies, and looks a lovely flow&rsquo;r,<br />
      New cropp&rsquo;d by virgin hands, to dress the bow&rsquo;r:<br />
      Unfaded yet, but yet unfed below,<br />
      No more to mother earth or the green stern shall owe.<br />
      Then two fair vests, of wondrous work and cost,<br />
      Of purple woven, and with gold emboss&rsquo;d,<br />
      For ornament the Trojan hero brought,<br />
      Which with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought.<br />
      One vest array&rsquo;d the corpse; and one they spread<br />
      O&rsquo;er his clos&rsquo;d eyes, and wrapp&rsquo;d around his head,<br />
      That, when the yellow hair in flame should fall,<br />
      The catching fire might burn the golden caul.<br />
      Besides, the spoils of foes in battle slain,<br />
      When he descended on the Latian plain;<br />
      Arms, trappings, horses, by the hearse are led<br />
      In long array&mdash;th&rsquo; achievements of the dead.<br />
      Then, pinion&rsquo;d with their hands behind, appear<br />
      Th&rsquo; unhappy captives, marching in the rear,<br />
      Appointed off&rsquo;rings in the victor&rsquo;s name,<br />
      To sprinkle with their blood the fun&rsquo;ral flame.<br />
      Inferior trophies by the chiefs are borne;<br />
      Gauntlets and helms their loaded hands adorn;<br />
      And fair inscriptions fix&rsquo;d, and titles read<br />

      Betwixt their arms he sinks upon the ground;<br />
      Where grov&rsquo;ling while he lies in deep despair,<br />
      He beats his breast, and rends his hoary hair.<br />
      The champion&rsquo;s chariot next is seen to roll,<br />
      Besmear&rsquo;d with hostile blood, and honourably foul.<br />
      To close the pomp, Aethon, the steed of state,<br />

      Stripp&rsquo;d of his trappings, with a sullen pace<br />
      He walks; and the big tears run rolling down his face.<br />
      The lance of Pallas, and the crimson crest,<br />

      Thus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse<br />

      Peace with the manes of great Pallas dwell!<br />
      Hail, holy relics! and a last farewell!&rdquo;<br />

      Their suit, which was too just to be denied,<br />

      Nor wage I wars unjust: your king denied<br />

      His cause in arms, to conquer or to die.<br />
      My right and his are in dispute: the slain<br />
      Fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain.<br />
      In equal arms let us alone contend;<br />

      Rushing from out the gate, the people stand,<br />
      Each with a fun&rsquo;ral flambeau in his hand.<br />
      Wildly they stare, distracted with amaze:<br />
      The fields are lighten&rsquo;d with a fiery blaze,<br />
      That cast a sullen splendour on their friends,<br />
      The marching troop which their dead prince attends.<br />
      Both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry;<br />
      The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply,<br />
      And their mix&rsquo;d mourning rends the vaulted sky.<br />
      The town is fill&rsquo;d with tumult and with tears,<br />
      Till the loud clamours reach Evander&rsquo;s ears:<br />
      Forgetful of his state, he runs along,<br />
      With a disorder&rsquo;d pace, and cleaves the throng;<br />
      Falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies,<br />
      With silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes.<br />
      Short sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks<br />
      A passage, and at once he weeps and speaks:<br />

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;O Pallas! thou hast fail&rsquo;d thy plighted word,<br />
      To fight with caution, not to tempt the sword!<br />
      I warn&rsquo;d thee, but in vain; for well I knew<br />
      What perils youthful ardour would pursue,<br />
      That boiling blood would carry thee too far,<br />
      Young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war!<br />
      O curst essay of arms, disastrous doom,<br />
      Prelude of bloody fields, and fights to come!<br />
      Hard elements of unauspicious war,<br />
      Vain vows to Heav&rsquo;n, and unavailing care!<br />
      Thrice happy thou, dear partner of my bed,<br />
      Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled,<br />
      Prescious of ills, and leaving me behind,<br />
      To drink the dregs of life by fate assign&rsquo;d!<br />
      Beyond the goal of nature I have gone:<br />
      My Pallas late set out, but reach&rsquo;d too soon.<br />
      If, for my league against th&rsquo; Ausonian state,<br />
      Amidst their weapons I had found my fate,<br />
      (Deserv&rsquo;d from them,) then I had been return&rsquo;d<br />
      A breathless victor, and my son had mourn&rsquo;d.<br />
      Yet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid,<br />
      Nor grudge th&rsquo; alliance I so gladly made.<br />
      &rsquo;Twas not his fault, my Pallas fell so young,<br />
      But my own crime, for having liv&rsquo;d too long.<br />
      Yet, since the gods had destin&rsquo;d him to die,<br />
      At least he led the way to victory:<br />
      First for his friends he won the fatal shore,<br />
      And sent whole herds of slaughter&rsquo;d foes before;<br />
      A death too great, too glorious to deplore.<br />
      Nor will I add new honours to thy grave,<br />
      Content with those the Trojan hero gave:<br />
      That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends design&rsquo;d,<br />
      In which the Tuscan chiefs and army join&rsquo;d.<br />
      Great spoils and trophies, gain&rsquo;d by thee, they bear:<br />
      Then let thy own achievements be thy share.<br />
      Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood,<br />
      Whose mighty trunk had better grac&rsquo;d the wood,<br />
      If Pallas had arriv&rsquo;d, with equal length<br />
      Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength.<br />
      But why, unhappy man, dost thou detain<br />
      These troops, to view the tears thou shedd&rsquo;st in vain?<br />
      Go, friends, this message to your lord relate:<br />
      Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate,<br />
      And, after Pallas&rsquo; death, live ling&rsquo;ring on,<br />
      &rsquo;Tis to behold his vengeance for my son.<br />
      I stay for Turnus, whose devoted head<br />
      Is owing to the living and the dead.<br />
      My son and I expect it from his hand;<br />
      &rsquo;Tis all that he can give, or we demand.<br />
      Joy is no more; but I would gladly go,<br />
      To greet my Pallas with such news below.&rdquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      The morn had now dispell&rsquo;d the shades of night,<br />
      Restoring toils, when she restor&rsquo;d the light.<br />
      The Trojan king and Tuscan chief command<br />
      To raise the piles along the winding strand.<br />
      Their friends convey the dead fun&rsquo;ral fires;<br />
      Black smould&rsquo;ring smoke from the green wood expires;<br />
      The light of heav&rsquo;n is chok&rsquo;d, and the new day retires.<br />
      Then thrice around the kindled piles they go<br />
      (For ancient custom had ordain&rsquo;d it so)<br />
      Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led;<br />
      And thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead.<br />
      Tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground,<br />
      And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound.<br />
      Amid the blaze, their pious brethren throw<br />
      The spoils, in battle taken from the foe:<br />
      Helms, bits emboss&rsquo;d, and swords of shining steel;<br />
      One casts a target, one a chariot wheel;<br />
      Some to their fellows their own arms restore:<br />
      The falchions which in luckless fight they bore,<br />
      Their bucklers pierc&rsquo;d, their darts bestow&rsquo;d in vain,<br />
      And shiver&rsquo;d lances gather&rsquo;d from the plain.<br />
      Whole herds of offer&rsquo;d bulls, about the fire,<br />
      And bristled boars, and woolly sheep expire.<br />
      Around the piles a careful troop attends,<br />
      To watch the wasting flames, and weep their burning friends;<br />
      Ling&rsquo;ring along the shore, till dewy night<br />
      New decks the face of heav&rsquo;n with starry light.<br />

      The corps of kings, and captains of renown,<br />
      Borne off in state, are buried in the town;<br />
      The rest, unhonour&rsquo;d, and without a name,<br />
      Are cast a common heap to feed the flame.<br />

      Now had the morning thrice renew&rsquo;d the light,<br />

      Perform the last sad office to the slain.<br />

      But, in the palace of the king, appears<br />

      Orphans their sires, and sires lament their sons.<br />
      All in that universal sorrow share,<br />
      And curse the cause of this unhappy war:<br />
      A broken league, a bride unjustly sought,<br />
      A crown usurp&rsquo;d, which with their blood is bought!<br />

      When Venulus began, the murmuring sound<br />
      Was hush&rsquo;d, and sacred silence reign&rsquo;d around.<br />
      &ldquo;We have,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;perform&rsquo;d your high command,<br />
      And pass&rsquo;d with peril a long tract of land:<br />
      We reach&rsquo;d the place desir&rsquo;d; with wonder fill&rsquo;d,<br />
      The Grecian tents and rising tow&rsquo;rs beheld.<br />
      Great Diomede has compass&rsquo;d round with walls<br />
      The city, which Argyripa he calls,<br />
      From his own Argos nam&rsquo;d. We touch&rsquo;d, with joy,<br />
      The royal hand that raz&rsquo;d unhappy Troy.<br />
      When introduc&rsquo;d, our presents first we bring,<br />
      Then crave an instant audience from the king.<br />
      His leave obtain&rsquo;d, our native soil we name,<br />
      And tell th&rsquo; important cause for which we came.<br />
      Attentively he heard us, while we spoke;<br />
      Then, with soft accents, and a pleasing look,<br />
      Made this return: &lsquo;Ausonian race, of old<br />
      Renown&rsquo;d for peace, and for an age of gold,<br />
      What madness has your alter&rsquo;d minds possess&rsquo;d,<br />
      To change for war hereditary rest,<br />
      Solicit arms unknown, and tempt the sword,<br />
      A needless ill your ancestors abhorr&rsquo;d?<br />
      We&mdash;for myself I speak, and all the name<br />
      Of Grecians, who to Troy&rsquo;s destruction came,<br />
      (Omitting those who were in battle slain,<br />
      Or borne by rolling Simois to the main)<br />
      Not one but suffer&rsquo;d, and too dearly bought<br />
      The prize of honour which in arms he sought;<br />
      Some doom&rsquo;d to death, and some in exile driv&rsquo;n.<br />
      Outcasts, abandon&rsquo;d by the care of Heav&rsquo;n;<br />
      So worn, so wretched, so despis&rsquo;d a crew,<br />
      As ev&rsquo;n old Priam might with pity view.<br />
      Witness the vessels by Minerva toss&rsquo;d<br />
      In storms; the vengeful Capharean coast;<br />
      Th&rsquo; Euboean rocks! the prince, whose brother led<br />
      Our armies to revenge his injur&rsquo;d bed,<br />
      In Egypt lost! Ulysses with his men<br />
      Have seen Charybdis and the Cyclops&rsquo; den.<br />
      Why should I name Idomeneus, in vain<br />
      Restor&rsquo;d to scepters, and expell&rsquo;d again?<br />
      Or young Achilles, by his rival slain?<br />
      Ev&rsquo;n he, the King of Men, the foremost name<br />
      Of all the Greeks, and most renown&rsquo;d by fame,<br />
      The proud revenger of another&rsquo;s wife,<br />
      Yet by his own adult&rsquo;ress lost his life;<br />
      Fell at his threshold; and the spoils of Troy<br />
      The foul polluters of his bed enjoy.<br />
      The gods have envied me the sweets of life,<br />
      My much lov&rsquo;d country, and my more lov&rsquo;d wife:<br />
      Banish&rsquo;d from both, I mourn; while in the sky,<br />
      Transform&rsquo;d to birds, my lost companions fly:<br />
      Hov&rsquo;ring about the coasts, they make their moan,<br />
      And cuff the cliffs with pinions not their own.<br />
      What squalid spectres, in the dead of night,<br />
      Break my short sleep, and skim before my sight!<br />
      I might have promis&rsquo;d to myself those harms,<br />
      Mad as I was, when I, with mortal arms,<br />
      Presum&rsquo;d against immortal pow&rsquo;rs to move,<br />
      And violate with wounds the Queen of Love.<br />
      Such arms this hand shall never more employ;<br />
      No hate remains with me to ruin&rsquo;d Troy.<br />
      I war not with its dust; nor am I glad<br />
      To think of past events, or good or bad.<br />
      Your presents I return: whate&rsquo;er you bring<br />
      To buy my friendship, send the Trojan king.<br />
      We met in fight; I know him, to my cost:<br />
      With what a whirling force his lance he toss&rsquo;d!<br />
      Heav&rsquo;ns! what a spring was in his arm, to throw!<br />
      How high he held his shield, and rose at ev&rsquo;ry blow!<br />
      Had Troy produc&rsquo;d two more his match in might,<br />
      They would have chang&rsquo;d the fortune of the fight:<br />
      Th&rsquo; invasion of the Greeks had been return&rsquo;d,<br />
      Our empire wasted, and our cities burn&rsquo;d.<br />
      The long defence the Trojan people made,<br />
      The war protracted, and the siege delay&rsquo;d,<br />
      Were due to Hector&rsquo;s and this hero&rsquo;s hand:<br />
      Both brave alike, and equal in command;<br />
      Aeneas, not inferior in the field,<br />
      In pious reverence to the gods excell&rsquo;d.<br />
      Make peace, ye Latians, and avoid with care<br />
      Th&rsquo; impending dangers of a fatal war.&rsquo;<br />
      He said no more; but, with this cold excuse,<br />
      Refus&rsquo;d th&rsquo; alliance, and advis&rsquo;d a truce.&rdquo;<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Thus Venulus concluded his report.<br />
      A jarring murmur fill&rsquo;d the factious court:<br />
      As, when a torrent rolls with rapid force,<br />
      And dashes o&rsquo;er the stones that stop the course,<br />
      The flood, constrain&rsquo;d within a scanty space,<br />
      Roars horrible along th&rsquo; uneasy race;<br />
      White foam in gath&rsquo;ring eddies floats around;<br />
      The rocky shores rebellow to the sound.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      The murmur ceas&rsquo;d: then from his lofty throne<br />
      The king invok&rsquo;d the gods, and thus begun:<br />
      &ldquo;I wish, ye Latins, what we now debate<br />
      Had been resolv&rsquo;d before it was too late.<br />
      Much better had it been for you and me,<br />
      Unforc&rsquo;d by this our last necessity,<br />
      To have been earlier wise, than now to call<br />
      A council, when the foe surrounds the wall.<br />
      O citizens, we wage unequal war,<br />
      With men not only Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s peculiar care,<br />
      But Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s own race; unconquer&rsquo;d in the field,<br />
      Or, conquer&rsquo;d, yet unknowing how to yield.<br />
      What hopes you had in Diomedes, lay down:<br />
      Our hopes must centre on ourselves alone.<br />
      Yet those how feeble, and, indeed, how vain,<br />
      You see too well; nor need my words explain.<br />
      Vanquish&rsquo;d without resource; laid flat by fate;<br />
      Factions within, a foe without the gate!<br />
      Not but I grant that all perform&rsquo;d their parts<br />
      With manly force, and with undaunted hearts:<br />
      With our united strength the war we wag&rsquo;d;<br />
      With equal numbers, equal arms, engag&rsquo;d.<br />
      You see th&rsquo; event.&mdash;Now hear what I propose,<br />
      To save our friends, and satisfy our foes.<br />
      A tract of land the Latins have possess&rsquo;d<br />
      Along the Tiber, stretching to the west,<br />
      Which now Rutulians and Auruncans till,<br />
      And their mix&rsquo;d cattle graze the fruitful hill.<br />
      Those mountains fill&rsquo;d with firs, that lower land,<br />
      If you consent, the Trojan shall command,<br />
      Call&rsquo;d into part of what is ours; and there,<br />
      On terms agreed, the common country share.<br />
      There let them build and settle, if they please;<br />
      Unless they choose once more to cross the seas,<br />
      In search of seats remote from Italy,<br />
      And from unwelcome inmates set us free.<br />
      Then twice ten galleys let us build with speed,<br />
      Or twice as many more, if more they need.<br />
      Materials are at hand; a well-grown wood<br />
      Runs equal with the margin of the flood:<br />
      Let them the number and the form assign;<br />
      The care and cost of all the stores be mine.<br />
      To treat the peace, a hundred senators<br />
      Shall be commission&rsquo;d hence with ample pow&rsquo;rs,<br />
      With olive the presents they shall bear,<br />
      A purple robe, a royal iv&rsquo;ry chair,<br />
      And all the marks of sway that Latian monarchs wear,<br />
      And sums of gold. Among yourselves debate<br />
      This great affair, and save the sinking state.&rdquo;<br />

      Then Drances took the word, who grudg&rsquo;d, long since,<br />

      Factious and rich, bold at the council board,<br />
      But cautious in the field, he shunn&rsquo;d the sword;<br />
      A close caballer, and tongue-valiant lord.<br />
      Noble his mother was, and near the throne;<br />
      But, what his father&rsquo;s parentage, unknown.<br />
      He rose, and took th&rsquo; advantage of the times,<br />
      To load young Turnus with invidious crimes.<br />

      As strike the sense, and all replies are vain;<br />

      Whose pride this unauspicious war began;<br />

      The man who menaces the gods with arms,<br />
      Yet, after all his boasts, forsook the fight,<br />
      And sought his safety in ignoble flight.<br />
      Now, best of kings, since you propose to send<br />
      Such bounteous presents to your Trojan friend;<br />
      Add yet a greater at our joint request,<br />
      One which he values more than all the rest:<br />
      Give him the fair Lavinia for his bride;<br />
      With that alliance let the league be tied,<br />
      And for the bleeding land a lasting peace provide.<br />
      Let insolence no longer awe the throne;<br />
      But, with a father&rsquo;s right, bestow your own.<br />
      For this maligner of the general good,<br />
      If still we fear his force, he must be woo&rsquo;d;<br />
      His haughty godhead we with pray&rsquo;rs implore,<br />
      Your scepter to release, and our just rights restore.<br />
      O cursed cause of all our ills, must we<br />
      Wage wars unjust, and fall in fight, for thee!<br />
      What right hast thou to rule the Latian state,<br />
      And send us out to meet our certain fate?<br />
      &rsquo;Tis a destructive war: from Turnus&rsquo; hand<br />
      Our peace and public safety we demand.<br />
      Let the fair bride to the brave chief remain;<br />
      If not, the peace, without the pledge, is vain.<br />
      Turnus, I know you think me not your friend,<br />
      Nor will I much with your belief contend:<br />
      I beg your greatness not to give the law<br />
      In others&rsquo; realms, but, beaten, to withdraw.<br />
      Pity your own, or pity our estate;<br />
      Nor twist our fortunes with your sinking fate.<br />
      Your interest is, the war should never cease;<br />
      But we have felt enough to wish the peace:<br />
      A land exhausted to the last remains,<br />
      Depopulated towns, and driven plains.<br />
      Yet, if desire of fame, and thirst of pow&rsquo;r,<br />
      A beauteous princess, with a crown in dow&rsquo;r,<br />
      So fire your mind, in arms assert your right,<br />
      And meet your foe, who dares you to the fight.<br />
      Mankind, it seems, is made for you alone;<br />
      We, but the slaves who mount you to the throne:<br />
      A base ignoble crowd, without a name,<br />
      Unwept, unworthy, of the fun&rsquo;ral flame,<br />
      By duty bound to forfeit each his life,<br />
      That Turnus may possess a royal wife.<br />
      Permit not, mighty man, so mean a crew<br />
      Should share such triumphs, and detain from you<br />
      The post of honour, your undoubted due.<br />

      Then, when the public need requires our swords.<br />
      First in the council hall to steer the state,<br />
      And ever foremost in a tongue-debate,<br />
      While our strong walls secure us from the foe,<br />
      Ere yet with blood our ditches overflow:<br />
      But let the potent orator declaim,<br />
      And with the brand of coward blot my name;<br />
      Free leave is giv&rsquo;n him, when his fatal hand<br />
      Has cover&rsquo;d with more corps the sanguine strand,<br />
      And high as mine his tow&rsquo;ring trophies stand.<br />
      If any doubt remains, who dares the most,<br />
      Let us decide it at the Trojan&rsquo;s cost,<br />
      And issue both abreast, where honour calls&mdash;<br />
      (Foes are not far to seek without the walls)<br />
      Unless his noisy tongue can only fight,<br />
      And feet were giv&rsquo;n him but to speed his flight.<br />
      I beaten from the field? I forc&rsquo;d away?<br />
      Who, but so known a dastard, dares to say?<br />
      Had he but ev&rsquo;n beheld the fight, his eyes<br />
      Had witness&rsquo;d for me what his tongue denies:<br />
      What heaps of Trojans by this hand were slain,<br />
      And how the bloody Tiber swell&rsquo;d the main.<br />
      All saw, but he, th&rsquo; Arcadian troops retire<br />
      In scatter&rsquo;d squadrons, and their prince expire.<br />
      The giant brothers, in their camp, have found,<br />
      I was not forc&rsquo;d with ease to quit my ground.<br />
      Not such the Trojans tried me, when, inclos&rsquo;d,<br />
      I singly their united arms oppos&rsquo;d:<br />
      First forc&rsquo;d an entrance thro&rsquo; their thick array;<br />
      Then, glutted with their slaughter, freed my way.<br />
      &rsquo;Tis a destructive war? So let it be,<br />
      But to the Phrygian pirate, and to thee!<br />
      Meantime proceed to fill the people&rsquo;s ears<br />
      With false reports, their minds with panic fears:<br />
      Extol the strength of a twice-conquer&rsquo;d race;<br />
      Our foes encourage, and our friends debase.<br />
      Believe thy fables, and the Trojan town<br />
      Triumphant stands; the Grecians are o&rsquo;erthrown;<br />
      Suppliant at Hector&rsquo;s feet Achilles lies,<br />
      And Diomede from fierce Aeneas flies.<br />
      Say rapid Aufidus with awful dread<br />
      Runs backward from the sea, and hides his head,<br />
      When the great Trojan on his bank appears;<br />
      For that&rsquo;s as true as thy dissembled fears<br />
      Of my revenge. Dismiss that vanity:<br />
      Thou, Drances, art below a death from me.<br />
      Let that vile soul in that vile body rest;<br />
      The lodging is well worthy of the guest.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;Now, royal father, to the present state<br />
      Of our affairs, and of this high debate:<br />
      If in your arms thus early you diffide,<br />
      And think your fortune is already tried;<br />
      If one defeat has brought us down so low,<br />
      As never more in fields to meet the foe;<br />
      Then I conclude for peace: &rsquo;tis time to treat,<br />
      And lie like vassals at the victor&rsquo;s feet.<br />
      But, O! if any ancient blood remains,<br />
      One drop of all our fathers&rsquo;, in our veins,<br />
      That man would I prefer before the rest,<br />
      Who dar&rsquo;d his death with an undaunted breast;<br />
      Who comely fell, by no dishonest wound,<br />
      To shun that sight, and, dying, gnaw&rsquo;d the ground.<br />
      But, if we still have fresh recruits in store,<br />
      If our confederates can afford us more;<br />
      If the contended field we bravely fought,<br />
      And not a bloodless victory was bought;<br />
      Their losses equal&rsquo;d ours; and, for their slain,<br />
      With equal fires they fill&rsquo;d the shining plain;<br />
      Why thus, unforc&rsquo;d, should we so tamely yield,<br />
      And, ere the trumpet sounds, resign the field?<br />
      Good unexpected, evils unforeseen,<br />
      Appear by turns, as fortune shifts the scene:<br />
      Some, rais&rsquo;d aloft, come tumbling down amain;<br />
      Then fall so hard, they bound and rise again.<br />
      If Diomede refuse his aid to lend,<br />
      The great Messapus yet remains our friend:<br />
      Tolumnius, who foretells events, is ours;<br />
      Th&rsquo; Italian chiefs and princes join their pow&rsquo;rs:<br />
      Nor least in number, nor in name the last,<br />
      Your own brave subjects have your cause embrac&rsquo;d<br />
      Above the rest, the Volscian Amazon<br />
      Contains an army in herself alone,<br />
      And heads a squadron, terrible to sight,<br />
      With glitt&rsquo;ring shields, in brazen armour bright.<br />
      Yet, if the foe a single fight demand,<br />
      And I alone the public peace withstand;<br />
      If you consent, he shall not be refus&rsquo;d,<br />
      Nor find a hand to victory unus&rsquo;d.<br />
      This new Achilles, let him take the field,<br />
      With fated armour, and Vulcanian shield!<br />
      For you, my royal father, and my fame,<br />
      I, Turnus, not the least of all my name,<br />
      Devote my soul. He calls me hand to hand,<br />
      And I alone will answer his demand.<br />
      Drances shall rest secure, and neither share<br />
      The danger, nor divide the prize of war.&rdquo;<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      While they debate, nor these nor those will yield,<br />
      Aeneas draws his forces to the field,<br />
      And moves his camp. The scouts with flying speed<br />
      Return, and thro&rsquo; the frighted city spread<br />
      Th&rsquo; unpleasing news, the Trojans are descried,<br />
      In battle marching by the river side,<br />
      And bending to the town. They take th&rsquo; alarm:<br />
      Some tremble, some are bold; all in confusion arm.<br />
      Th&rsquo; impetuous youth press forward to the field;<br />
      They clash the sword, and clatter on the shield:<br />
      The fearful matrons raise a screaming cry;<br />
      Old feeble men with fainter groans reply;<br />
      A jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky,<br />
      Like that of swans remurm&rsquo;ring to the floods,<br />
      Or birds of diff&rsquo;ring kinds in hollow woods.<br />

      Turnus th&rsquo; occasion takes, and cries aloud:<br />

      Declaim in praise of peace, when danger calls,<br />
      And the fierce foes in arms approach the walls.&rdquo;<br />
      He said, and, turning short, with speedy pace,<br />
      Casts back a scornful glance, and quits the place:<br />
      &ldquo;Thou, Volusus, the Volscian troops command<br />
      To mount; and lead thyself our Ardean band.<br />

      The gath&rsquo;ring storm just breaking on the state,<br />
      Dismiss&rsquo;d the council till a fitter time,<br />
      And own&rsquo;d his easy temper as his crime,<br />

      Some help to sink new trenches; others aid<br />

      Runs a distracted crew, whom their last labour calls.<br />
      A sad procession in the streets is seen,<br />
      Of matrons, that attend the mother queen:<br />
      High in her chair she sits, and, at her side,<br />
      With downcast eyes, appears the fatal bride.<br />
      They mount the cliff, where Pallas&rsquo; temple stands;<br />
      Pray&rsquo;rs in their mouths, and presents in their hands,<br />
      With censers first they fume the sacred shrine,<br />

      Now Turnus arms for fight. His back and breast<br />

      With godlike grace, he from the tow&rsquo;r descends.<br />

      His absent rival, and to promise war.<br />
      Freed from his keepers, thus, with broken reins,<br />
      The wanton courser prances o&rsquo;er the plains,<br />
      Or in the pride of youth o&rsquo;erleaps the mounds,<br />
      And snuffs the females in forbidden grounds.<br />
      Or seeks his wat&rsquo;ring in the well-known flood,<br />
      To quench his thirst, and cool his fiery blood:<br />
      He swims luxuriant in the liquid plain,<br />
      And o&rsquo;er his shoulder flows his waving mane:<br />
      He neighs, he snorts, he bears his head on high;<br />
      Before his ample chest the frothy waters fly.<br />

      Soon as the prince appears without the gate,<br />

      Her squadron imitates, and each descends;<br />
      Whose common suit Camilla thus commends:<br />

      Turnus a while stood mute, with glad surprise,<br />

      With chosen foot his passage to forelay,<br />
      And place an ambush in the winding way.<br />
      Thou, with thy Volscians, face the Tuscan horse;<br />
      The brave Messapus shall thy troops enforce<br />
      With those of Tibur, and the Latian band,<br />

      This said, he warns Messapus to the war,<br />

      Inclos&rsquo;d with hills, a winding valley lies,<br />
      By nature form&rsquo;d for fraud, and fitted for surprise.<br />
      A narrow track, by human steps untrode,<br />
      Leads, thro&rsquo; perplexing thorns, to this obscure abode.<br />
      High o&rsquo;er the vale a steepy mountain stands,<br />
      Whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands.<br />
      The top is level, an offensive seat<br />
      Of war; and from the war a safe retreat:<br />
      For, on the right and left, is room to press<br />
      The foes at hand, or from afar distress;<br />
      To drive &rsquo;em headlong downward, and to pour<br />
      On their descending backs a stony show&rsquo;r.<br />

      Meantime Latonian Phoebe, from the skies,<br />

      Her father Metabus, when forc&rsquo;d away<br />
      From old Privernum, for tyrannic sway,<br />
      Snatch&rsquo;d up, and sav&rsquo;d from his prevailing foes,<br />
      This tender babe, companion of his woes.<br />
      Casmilla was her mother; but he drown&rsquo;d<br />
      One hissing letter in a softer sound,<br />
      And call&rsquo;d Camilla. Thro&rsquo; the woods he flies;<br />
      Wrapp&rsquo;d in his robe the royal infant lies.<br />
      His foes in sight, he mends his weary pace;<br />
      With shout and clamours they pursue the chase.<br />
      The banks of Amasene at length he gains:<br />

    <p class="poem">
      The raging flood his farther flight restrains,<br />
      Rais&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er the borders with unusual rains.<br />
      Prepar&rsquo;d to plunge into the stream, he fears,<br />
      Not for himself, but for the charge he bears.<br />
      Anxious, he stops a while, and thinks in haste;<br />
      Then, desp&rsquo;rate in distress, resolves at last.<br />
      A knotty lance of well-boil&rsquo;d oak he bore;<br />
      The middle part with cork he cover&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er:<br />
      He clos&rsquo;d the child within the hollow space;<br />
      With twigs of bending osier bound the case;<br />
      Then pois&rsquo;d the spear, heavy with human weight,<br />
      And thus invok&rsquo;d my favour for the freight:<br />
      &lsquo;Accept, great goddess of the woods,&rsquo; he said,<br />
      &lsquo;Sent by her sire, this dedicated maid!<br />
      Thro&rsquo; air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine;<br />
      And the first weapons that she knows, are thine.&rsquo;<br />
      He said; and with full force the spear he threw:<br />

      Then, press&rsquo;d by foes, he stemm&rsquo;d the stormy tide,<br />
      And gain&rsquo;d, by stress of arms, the farther side.<br />
      His fasten&rsquo;d spear he pull&rsquo;d from out the ground,<br />
      And, victor of his vows, his infant nymph unbound;<br />
      Nor, after that, in towns which walls inclose,<br />
      Would trust his hunted life amidst his foes;<br />
      But, rough, in open air he chose to lie;<br />
      Earth was his couch, his cov&rsquo;ring was the sky.<br />
      On hills unshorn, or in a desert den,<br />
      He shunn&rsquo;d the dire society of men.<br />
      A shepherd&rsquo;s solitary life he led;<br />
      His daughter with the milk of mares he fed.<br />
      The dugs of bears, and ev&rsquo;ry salvage beast,<br />
      He drew, and thro&rsquo; her lips the liquor press&rsquo;d.<br />
      The little Amazon could scarcely go:<br />
      He loads her with a quiver and a bow;<br />
      And, that she might her stagg&rsquo;ring steps command,<br />
      He with a slender jav&rsquo;lin fills her hand.<br />
      Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound;<br />
      Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground.<br />
      Instead of these, a tiger&rsquo;s hide o&rsquo;erspread<br />
      Her back and shoulders, fasten&rsquo;d to her head.<br />
      The flying dart she first attempts to fling,<br />
      And round her tender temples toss&rsquo;d the sling;<br />
      Then, as her strength with years increas&rsquo;d, began<br />
      To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan,<br />
      And from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane.<br />
      The Tuscan matrons with each other vied,<br />
      To bless their rival sons with such a bride;<br />
      But she disdains their love, to share with me<br />
      The sylvan shades and vow&rsquo;d virginity.<br />
      And, O! I wish, contented with my cares<br />
      Of salvage spoils, she had not sought the wars!<br />
      Then had she been of my celestial train,<br />
      And shunn&rsquo;d the fate that dooms her to be slain.<br />
      But since, opposing Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s decree, she goes<br />
      To find her death among forbidden foes,<br />
      Haste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight.<br />
      Where, with the gods, averse, the Latins fight.<br />
      This bow to thee, this quiver I bequeath,<br />
      This chosen arrow, to revenge her death:<br />
      By whate&rsquo;er hand Camilla shall be slain,<br />
      Or of the Trojan or Italian train,<br />
      Let him not pass unpunish&rsquo;d from the plain.<br />
      Then, in a hollow cloud, myself will aid<br />
      To bear the breathless body of my maid:<br />
      Unspoil&rsquo;d shall be her arms, and unprofan&rsquo;d<br />
      Her holy limbs with any human hand,<br />
      And in a marble tomb laid in her native land.&rdquo;<br />

      Shields, arms, and spears flash horribly from far;<br />

      The neighing coursers, and the shouting men.<br />
      In distance of their darts they stop their course;<br />
      Then man to man they rush, and horse to horse.<br />
      The face of heav&rsquo;n their flying jav&rsquo;lins hide,<br />

      Tyrrhenus, and Aconteus, void of fear,<br />

      Close in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue,<br />
      And urge their flight: Asylas leads the chase;<br />
      Till, seiz&rsquo;d, with shame, they wheel about and face,<br />
      Receive their foes, and raise a threat&rsquo;ning cry.<br />
      The Tuscans take their turn to fear and fly.<br />
      So swelling surges, with a thund&rsquo;ring roar,<br />
      Driv&rsquo;n on each other&rsquo;s backs, insult the shore,<br />
      Bound o&rsquo;er the rocks, incroach upon the land,<br />
      And far upon the beach eject the sand;<br />
      Then backward, with a swing, they take their way,<br />
      Repuls&rsquo;d from upper ground, and seek their mother sea;<br />
      With equal hurry quit th&rsquo; invaded shore,<br />

      Across the shoulders came the feather&rsquo;d wound;<br />
      Transfix&rsquo;d he fell, and doubled to the ground.<br />
      The sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed,<br />
      And death with honour sought on either side.<br />

      Resistless thro&rsquo; the war Camilla rode,<br />

      One shoulder with her painted quiver press&rsquo;d.<br />
      Now from afar her fatal jav&rsquo;lins play;<br />
      Now with her ax&rsquo;s edge she hews her way:<br />
      Diana&rsquo;s arms upon her shoulder sound;<br />
      And when, too closely press&rsquo;d, she quits the ground,<br />
      From her bent bow she sends a backward wound.<br />
      Her maids, in martial pomp, on either side,<br />
      Larina, Tulla, fierce Tarpeia, ride:<br />
      Italians all; in peace, their queen&rsquo;s delight;<br />
      In war, the bold companions of the fight.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Who foremost, and who last, heroic maid,<br />
      On the cold earth were by thy courage laid?<br />
      Thy spear, of mountain ash, Eumenius first,<br />
      With fury driv&rsquo;n, from side to side transpierc&rsquo;d:<br />
      A purple stream came spouting from the wound;<br />
      Bath&rsquo;d in his blood he lies, and bites the ground.<br />
      Liris and Pegasus at once she slew:<br />
      The former, as the slacken&rsquo;d reins he drew<br />
      Of his faint steed; the latter, as he stretch&rsquo;d<br />
      His arm to prop his friend, the jav&rsquo;lin reach&rsquo;d.<br />
      By the same weapon, sent from the same hand,<br />
      Both fall together, and both spurn the sand.<br />
      Amastrus next is added to the slain:<br />
      The rest in rout she follows o&rsquo;er the plain:<br />
      Tereus, Harpalycus, Demophoon,<br />
      And Chromis, at full speed her fury shun.<br />
      Of all her deadly darts, not one she lost;<br />
      Each was attended with a Trojan ghost.<br />
      Young Ornithus bestrode a hunter steed,<br />
      Swift for the chase, and of Apulian breed.<br />
      Him from afar she spied, in arms unknown:<br />
      O&rsquo;er his broad back an ox&rsquo;s hide was thrown;<br />
      His helm a wolf, whose gaping jaws were spread<br />
      A cov&rsquo;ring for his cheeks, and grinn&rsquo;d around his head,<br />
      He clench&rsquo;d within his hand an iron prong,<br />
      And tower&rsquo;d above the rest, conspicuous in the throng.<br />
      Him soon she singled from the flying train,<br />
      And slew with ease; then thus insults the slain:<br />
      &ldquo;Vain hunter, didst thou think thro&rsquo; woods to chase<br />
      The savage herd, a vile and trembling race?<br />
      Here cease thy vaunts, and own my victory:<br />
      A woman warrior was too strong for thee.<br />
      Yet, if the ghosts demand the conqu&rsquo;ror&rsquo;s name,<br />
      Confessing great Camilla, save thy shame.&rdquo;<br />
      Then Butes and Orsilochus she slew,<br />
      The bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew;<br />
      But Butes breast to breast: the spear descends<br />
      Above the gorget, where his helmet ends,<br />
      And o&rsquo;er the shield which his left side defends.<br />
      Orsilochus and she their courses ply:<br />
      He seems to follow, and she seems to fly;<br />
      But in a narrower ring she makes the race;<br />
      And then he flies, and she pursues the chase.<br />
      Gath&rsquo;ring at length on her deluded foe,<br />
      She swings her ax, and rises to the blow<br />
      Full on the helm behind, with such a sway<br />
      The weapon falls, the riven steel gives way:<br />
      He groans, he roars, he sues in vain for grace;<br />
      Brains, mingled with his blood, besmear his face.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      Astonish&rsquo;d Aunus just arrives by chance,<br />
      To see his fall; nor farther dares advance;<br />
      But, fixing on the horrid maid his eye,<br />
      He stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly;<br />
      Yet, like a true Ligurian, born to cheat,<br />
      (At least while fortune favour&rsquo;d his deceit,)<br />
      Cries out aloud: &ldquo;What courage have you shown,<br />
      Who trust your courser&rsquo;s strength, and not your own?<br />
      Forego the vantage of your horse, alight,<br />
      And then on equal terms begin the fight:<br />
      It shall be seen, weak woman, what you can,<br />
      When, foot to foot, you combat with a man,&rdquo;<br />
      He said. She glows with anger and disdain,<br />
      Dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain,<br />
      And leaves her horse at large among her train;<br />
      With her drawn sword defies him to the field,<br />
      And, marching, lifts aloft her maiden shield.<br />
      The youth, who thought his cunning did succeed,<br />
      Reins round his horse, and urges all his speed;<br />
      Adds the remembrance of the spur, and hides<br />
      The goring rowels in his bleeding sides.<br />
      &ldquo;Vain fool, and coward!&rdquo; cries the lofty maid,<br />
      &ldquo;Caught in the train which thou thyself hast laid!<br />
      On others practice thy Ligurian arts;<br />
      Thin stratagems and tricks of little hearts<br />
      Are lost on me: nor shalt thou safe retire,<br />
      With vaunting lies, to thy fallacious sire.&rdquo;<br />
      At this, so fast her flying feet she sped,<br />
      That soon she strain&rsquo;d beyond his horse&rsquo;s head:<br />
      Then turning short, at once she seiz&rsquo;d the rein,<br />
      And laid the boaster grov&rsquo;ling on the plain.<br />
      Not with more ease the falcon, from above,<br />
      Trusses in middle air the trembling dove,<br />
      Then plumes the prey, in her strong pounces bound:<br />
      The feathers, foul with blood, come tumbling to the ground.<br />

      Now mighty Jove, from his superior height,<br />

      Betwixt the broken ranks the Tuscan rides,<br />
      And these encourages, and those he chides;<br />
      Recalls each leader, by his name, from flight;<br />

      Now cast away the sword, and quit the shield!<br />
      What use of weapons which you dare not wield?<br />
      Not thus you fly your female foes by night,<br />
      Nor shun the feast, when the full bowls invite;<br />
      When to fat off&rsquo;rings the glad augur calls,<br />
      And the shrill hornpipe sounds to bacchanals.<br />
      These are your studied cares, your lewd delight:<br />
      Swift to debauch, but slow to manly fight.&rdquo;<br />

      In his strong gripe, and clasp&rsquo;d around the waist;<br />
      &rsquo;Twas Venulus, whom from his horse he tore,<br />
      And, laid athwart his own, in triumph bore.<br />
      Loud shouts ensue; the Latins turn their eyes,<br />
      And view th&rsquo; unusual sight with vast surprise.<br />
      The fiery Tarchon, flying o&rsquo;er the plains,<br />
      Press&rsquo;d in his arms the pond&rsquo;rous prey sustains;<br />
      Then, with his shorten&rsquo;d spear, explores around<br />
      His jointed arms, to fix a deadly wound.<br />
      Nor less the captive struggles for his life:<br />
      He writhes his body to prolong the strife,<br />
      And, fencing for his naked throat, exerts<br />
      His utmost vigour, and the point averts.<br />
      So stoops the yellow eagle from on high,<br />
      And bears a speckled serpent thro&rsquo; the sky,<br />
      Fast&rsquo;ning his crooked talons on the prey:<br />
      The pris&rsquo;ner hisses thro&rsquo; the liquid way;<br />
      Resists the royal hawk; and, tho&rsquo; oppress&rsquo;d,<br />
      She fights in volumes, and erects her crest:<br />
      Turn&rsquo;d to her foe, she stiffens ev&rsquo;ry scale,<br />
      And shoots her forky tongue, and whisks her threat&rsquo;ning tail.<br />
      Against the victor, all defence is weak:<br />
      Th&rsquo; imperial bird still plies her with his beak;<br />
      He tears her bowels, and her breast he gores;<br />
      Then claps his pinions, and securely soars.<br />
      Thus, thro&rsquo; the midst of circling enemies,<br />
      Strong Tarchon snatch&rsquo;d and bore away his prize.<br />
      The Tyrrhene troops, that shrunk before, now press<br />
      The Latins, and presume the like success.<br />

      Chloreus, the priest of Cybele, from far,<br />
      Glitt&rsquo;ring in Phrygian arms amidst the war,<br />
      Was by the virgin view&rsquo;d. The steed he press&rsquo;d<br />
      Was proud with trappings, and his brawny chest<br />
      With scales of gilded brass was cover&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er;<br />
      A robe of Tyrian dye the rider wore.<br />
      With deadly wounds he gall&rsquo;d the distant foe;<br />
      Gnossian his shafts, and Lycian was his bow:<br />
      A golden helm his front and head surrounds<br />
      A gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds.<br />
      Gold, weav&rsquo;d with linen, on his thighs he wore,<br />
      With flowers of needlework distinguish&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er,<br />
      With golden buckles bound, and gather&rsquo;d up before.<br />
      Him the fierce maid beheld with ardent eyes,<br />
      Fond and ambitious of so rich a prize,<br />
      Or that the temple might his trophies hold,<br />
      Or else to shine herself in Trojan gold.<br />
      Blind in her haste, she chases him alone.<br />

      broken by the Rutuli, who wound Aeneas. He is miraculously cured by Venus,
      forces Turnus to a duel, and concludes the poem with his death.

      The more he was with vulgar hate oppress&rsquo;d,<br />
      The more his fury boil&rsquo;d within his breast:<br />

      Trembling with rage, around the court he ran,<br />

      &ldquo;No more excuses or delays: I stand<br />
      In arms prepar&rsquo;d to combat, hand to hand,<br />
      This base deserter of his native land.<br />

    <p class="poem">
      To whom the king sedately thus replied:<br />
      &ldquo;Brave youth, the more your valour has been tried,<br />
      The more becomes it us, with due respect,<br />
      To weigh the chance of war, which you neglect.<br />
      You want not wealth, or a successive throne,<br />
      Or cities which your arms have made your own:<br />
      My towns and treasures are at your command,<br />
      And stor&rsquo;d with blooming beauties is my land;<br />
      Laurentum more than one Lavinia sees,<br />
      Unmarried, fair, of noble families.<br />
      Now let me speak, and you with patience hear,<br />
      Things which perhaps may grate a lover&rsquo;s ear,<br />
      But sound advice, proceeding from a heart<br />
      Sincerely yours, and free from fraudful art.<br />
      The gods, by signs, have manifestly shown,<br />
      No prince Italian born should heir my throne:<br />
      Oft have our augurs, in prediction skill&rsquo;d,<br />
      And oft our priests, a foreign son reveal&rsquo;d.<br />
      Yet, won by worth that cannot be withstood,<br />
      Brib&rsquo;d by my kindness to my kindred blood,<br />
      Urg&rsquo;d by my wife, who would not be denied,<br />
      I promis&rsquo;d my Lavinia for your bride:<br />
      Her from her plighted lord by force I took;<br />
      All ties of treaties, and of honour, broke:<br />
      On your account I wag&rsquo;d an impious war&mdash;<br />
      With what success, &rsquo;tis needless to declare;<br />
      I and my subjects feel, and you have had your share.<br />
      Twice vanquish&rsquo;d while in bloody fields we strive,<br />
      Scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive:<br />
      The rolling flood runs warm with human gore;<br />
      The bones of Latians blanch the neighb&rsquo;ring shore.<br />
      Why put I not an end to this debate,<br />
      Still unresolv&rsquo;d, and still a slave to fate?<br />
      If Turnus&rsquo; death a lasting peace can give,<br />
      Why should I not procure it whilst you live?<br />
      Should I to doubtful arms your youth betray,<br />
      What would my kinsmen, the Rutulians, say?<br />
      And, should you fall in fight, (which Heav&rsquo;n defend!)<br />
      How curse the cause which hasten&rsquo;d to his end<br />
      The daughter&rsquo;s lover and the father&rsquo;s friend?<br />
      Weigh in your mind the various chance of war;<br />
      Pity your parent&rsquo;s age, and ease his care.&rdquo;<br />

      Such balmy words he pour&rsquo;d, but all in vain:<br />
      The proffer&rsquo;d med&rsquo;cine but provok&rsquo;d the pain.<br />

      With intermitting sobs thus vents his grief:<br />
      &ldquo;The care, O best of fathers, which you take<br />
      For my concerns, at my desire forsake.<br />

      This arm, this lance, can well dispute the prize;<br />
      And the blood follows, where the weapon flies.<br />
      His goddess mother is not near, to shroud<br />
      The flying coward with an empty cloud.&rdquo;<br />

      But now the queen, who fear&rsquo;d for Turnus&rsquo; life,<br />

      In these sad accents gave her sorrow breath:<br />

      Depends Latinus, and the Latian throne:<br />
      Refuse me not this one, this only pray&rsquo;r,<br />
      To waive the combat, and pursue the war.<br />
      Whatever chance attends this fatal strife,<br />
      Think it includes, in thine, Amata&rsquo;s life.<br />

      The driving colours, never at a stay,<br />
      Run here and there, and flush, and fade away.<br />
      Delightful change! Thus Indian iv&rsquo;ry shows,<br />

      Yet, pressing foot by foot, his foe pursues.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Thus, when a fearful stag is clos&rsquo;d around<br />
      With crimson toils, or in a river found,<br />
      High on the bank the deep-mouth&rsquo;d hound appears,<br />
      Still opening, following still, where&rsquo;er he steers;<br />
      The persecuted creature, to and fro,<br />
      Turns here and there, to scape his Umbrian foe:<br />
      Steep is th&rsquo; ascent, and, if he gains the land,<br />
      The purple death is pitch&rsquo;d along the strand.<br />
      His eager foe, determin&rsquo;d to the chase,<br />
      Stretch&rsquo;d at his length, gains ground at ev&rsquo;ry pace;<br />
      Now to his beamy head he makes his way,<br />
      And now he holds, or thinks he holds, his prey:<br />
      Just at the pinch, the stag springs out with fear;<br />
      He bites the wind, and fills his sounding jaws with air:<br />
      The rocks, the lakes, the meadows ring with cries;<br />
      The mortal tumult mounts, and thunders in the skies.<br />
      Thus flies the Daunian prince, and, flying, blames<br />
      His tardy troops, and, calling by their names,<br />
      Demands his trusty sword. The Trojan threats<br />
      The realm with ruin, and their ancient seats<br />
      To lay in ashes, if they dare supply<br />
      With arms or aid his vanquish&rsquo;d enemy:<br />
      Thus menacing, he still pursues the course,<br />
      With vigour, tho&rsquo; diminish&rsquo;d of his force.<br />
      Ten times already round the listed place<br />
      One chief had fled, and t&rsquo; other giv&rsquo;n the chase:<br />
      No trivial prize is play&rsquo;d; for on the life<br />
      Or death of Turnus now depends the strife.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Within the space, an olive tree had stood,<br />
      A sacred shade, a venerable wood,<br />
      For vows to Faunus paid, the Latins&rsquo; guardian god.<br />
      Here hung the vests, and tablets were engrav&rsquo;d,<br />
      Of sinking mariners from shipwreck sav&rsquo;d.<br />
      With heedless hands the Trojans fell&rsquo;d the tree,<br />
      To make the ground enclos&rsquo;d for combat free.<br />
      Deep in the root, whether by fate, or chance,<br />
      Or erring haste, the Trojan drove his lance;<br />
      Then stoop&rsquo;d, and tugg&rsquo;d with force immense, to free<br />
      Th&rsquo; incumber&rsquo;d spear from the tenacious tree;<br />
      That, whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain,<br />
      His flying weapon might from far attain.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Confus&rsquo;d with fear, bereft of human aid,<br />
      Then Turnus to the gods, and first to Faunus pray&rsquo;d:<br />
      &ldquo;O Faunus, pity! and thou Mother Earth,<br />
      Where I thy foster son receiv&rsquo;d my birth,<br />
      Hold fast the steel! If my religious hand<br />
      Your plant has honour&rsquo;d, which your foes profan&rsquo;d,<br />
      Propitious hear my pious pray&rsquo;r!&rdquo; He said,<br />
      Nor with successless vows invok&rsquo;d their aid.<br />
      Th&rsquo; incumbent hero wrench&rsquo;d, and pull&rsquo;d, and strain&rsquo;d;<br />
      But still the stubborn earth the steel detain&rsquo;d.<br />
      Juturna took her time; and, while in vain<br />
      He strove, assum&rsquo;d Meticus&rsquo; form again,<br />
      And, in that imitated shape, restor&rsquo;d<br />
      To the despairing prince his Daunian sword.<br />
      The Queen of Love, who, with disdain and grief,<br />
      Saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief,<br />
      T&rsquo; assert her offspring with a greater deed,<br />
      From the tough root the ling&rsquo;ring weapon freed.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Once more erect, the rival chiefs advance:<br />
      One trusts the sword, and one the pointed lance;<br />
      And both resolv&rsquo;d alike to try their fatal chance.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Meantime imperial Jove to Juno spoke,<br />
      Who from a shining cloud beheld the shock:<br />
      &ldquo;What new arrest, O Queen of Heav&rsquo;n, is sent<br />
      To stop the Fates now lab&rsquo;ring in th&rsquo; event?<br />
      What farther hopes are left thee to pursue?<br />
      Divine Aeneas, (and thou know&rsquo;st it too,)<br />
      Foredoom&rsquo;d, to these celestial seats are due.<br />
      What more attempts for Turnus can be made,<br />
      That thus thou ling&rsquo;rest in this lonely shade?<br />
      Is it becoming of the due respect<br />
      And awful honour of a god elect,<br />
      A wound unworthy of our state to feel,<br />
      Patient of human hands and earthly steel?<br />
      Or seems it just, the sister should restore<br />
      A second sword, when one was lost before,<br />
      And arm a conquer&rsquo;d wretch against his conqueror?<br />
      For what, without thy knowledge and avow,<br />
      Nay more, thy dictate, durst Juturna do?<br />
      At last, in deference to my love, forbear<br />
      To lodge within thy soul this anxious care;<br />
      Reclin&rsquo;d upon my breast, thy grief unload:<br />
      Who should relieve the goddess, but the god?<br />
      Now all things to their utmost issue tend,<br />
      Push&rsquo;d by the Fates to their appointed end.<br />
      While leave was giv&rsquo;n thee, and a lawful hour<br />
      For vengeance, wrath, and unresisted pow&rsquo;r,<br />
      Toss&rsquo;d on the seas, thou couldst thy foes distress,<br />
      And, driv&rsquo;n ashore, with hostile arms oppress;<br />
      Deform the royal house; and, from the side<br />
      Of the just bridegroom, tear the plighted bride:<br />
      Now cease at my command.&rdquo; The Thund&rsquo;rer said;<br />
      And, with dejected eyes, this answer Juno made:<br />
      &ldquo;Because your dread decree too well I knew,<br />
      From Turnus and from earth unwilling I withdrew.<br />
      Else should you not behold me here, alone,<br />
      Involv&rsquo;d in empty clouds, my friends bemoan,<br />
      But, girt with vengeful flames, in open sight<br />
      Engag&rsquo;d against my foes in mortal fight.<br />
      &rsquo;Tis true, Juturna mingled in the strife<br />
      By my command, to save her brother&rsquo;s life,<br />
      At least to try; but, by the Stygian lake,<br />
      (The most religious oath the gods can take,)<br />
      With this restriction, not to bend the bow,<br />
      Or toss the spear, or trembling dart to throw.<br />
      And now, resign&rsquo;d to your superior might,<br />
      And tir&rsquo;d with fruitless toils, I loathe the fight.<br />
      This let me beg (and this no fates withstand)<br />
      Both for myself and for your father&rsquo;s land,<br />
      That, when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace,<br />
      (Which I, since you ordain, consent to bless,)<br />
      The laws of either nation be the same;<br />
      But let the Latins still retain their name,<br />
      Speak the same language which they spoke before,<br />
      Wear the same habits which their grandsires wore.<br />
      Call them not Trojans: perish the renown<br />
      And name of Troy, with that detested town.<br />
      Latium be Latium still; let Alba reign<br />
      And Rome&rsquo;s immortal majesty remain.&rdquo;<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Then thus the founder of mankind replies<br />
      (Unruffled was his front, serene his eyes)<br />
      &ldquo;Can Saturn&rsquo;s issue, and heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s other heir,<br />
      Such endless anger in her bosom bear?<br />
      Be mistress, and your full desires obtain;<br />
      But quench the choler you foment in vain.<br />
      From ancient blood th&rsquo; Ausonian people sprung,<br />
      Shall keep their name, their habit, and their tongue.<br />
      The Trojans to their customs shall be tied:<br />
      I will, myself, their common rites provide;<br />
      The natives shall command, the foreigners subside.<br />
      All shall be Latium; Troy without a name;<br />
      And her lost sons forget from whence they came.<br />
      From blood so mix&rsquo;d, a pious race shall flow,<br />
      Equal to gods, excelling all below.<br />
      No nation more respect to you shall pay,<br />
      Or greater off&rsquo;rings on your altars lay.&rdquo;<br />
      Juno consents, well pleas&rsquo;d that her desires<br />
      Had found success, and from the cloud retires.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      The peace thus made, the Thund&rsquo;rer next prepares<br />
      To force the wat&rsquo;ry goddess from the wars.<br />
      Deep in the dismal regions void of light,<br />
      Three daughters at a birth were born to Night:<br />
      These their brown mother, brooding on her care,<br />
      Indued with windy wings to flit in air,<br />
      With serpents girt alike, and crown&rsquo;d with hissing hair.<br />
      In heav&rsquo;n the Dirae call&rsquo;d, and still at hand,<br />
      Before the throne of angry Jove they stand,<br />
      His ministers of wrath, and ready still<br />
      The minds of mortal men with fears to fill,<br />
      Whene&rsquo;er the moody sire, to wreak his hate<br />
      On realms or towns deserving of their fate,<br />
      Hurls down diseases, death and deadly care,<br />
      And terrifies the guilty world with war.<br />
      One sister plague if these from heav&rsquo;n he sent,<br />
      To fright Juturna with a dire portent.<br />
      The pest comes whirling down: by far more slow<br />
      Springs the swift arrow from the Parthian bow,<br />
      Or Cydon yew, when, traversing the skies,<br />
      And drench&rsquo;d in pois&rsquo;nous juice, the sure destruction flies.<br />
      With such a sudden and unseen a flight<br />
      Shot thro&rsquo; the clouds the daughter of the night.<br />
      Soon as the field inclos&rsquo;d she had in view,<br />
      And from afar her destin&rsquo;d quarry knew,<br />
      Contracted, to the boding bird she turns,<br />
      Which haunts the ruin&rsquo;d piles and hallow&rsquo;d urns,<br />
      And beats about the tombs with nightly wings,<br />
      Where songs obscene on sepulchers she sings.<br />
      Thus lessen&rsquo;d in her form, with frightful cries<br />
      The Fury round unhappy Turnus flies,<br />
      Flaps on his shield, and flutters o&rsquo;er his eyes.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      A lazy chillness crept along his blood;<br />
      Chok&rsquo;d was his voice; his hair with horror stood.<br />
      Juturna from afar beheld her fly,<br />
      And knew th&rsquo; ill omen, by her screaming cry<br />
      And stridor of her wings. Amaz&rsquo;d with fear,<br />
      Her beauteous breast she beat, and rent her flowing hair.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      &ldquo;Ah me!&rdquo; she cries, &ldquo;in this unequal strife<br />
      What can thy sister more to save thy life?<br />
      Weak as I am, can I, alas! contend<br />
      In arms with that inexorable fiend?<br />
      Now, now, I quit the field! forbear to fright<br />
      My tender soul, ye baleful birds of night;<br />
      The lashing of your wings I know too well,<br />
      The sounding flight, and fun&rsquo;ral screams of hell!<br />
      These are the gifts you bring from haughty Jove,<br />
      The worthy recompense of ravish&rsquo;d love!<br />
      Did he for this exempt my life from fate?<br />
      O hard conditions of immortal state,<br />
      Tho&rsquo; born to death, not privileg&rsquo;d to die,<br />
      But forc&rsquo;d to bear impos&rsquo;d eternity!<br />
      Take back your envious bribes, and let me go<br />
      Companion to my brother&rsquo;s ghost below!<br />
      The joys are vanish&rsquo;d: nothing now remains,<br />
      Of life immortal, but immortal pains.<br />
      What earth will open her devouring womb,<br />
      To rest a weary goddess in the tomb!&rdquo;<br />
      She drew a length of sighs; nor more she said,<br />
      But in her azure mantle wrapp&rsquo;d her head,<br />
      Then plung&rsquo;d into her stream, with deep despair,<br />
      And her last sobs came bubbling up in air.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Now stern Aeneas his weighty spear<br />
      Against his foe, and thus upbraids his fear:<br />
      &ldquo;What farther subterfuge can Turnus find?<br />
      What empty hopes are harbour&rsquo;d in his mind?<br />
      &rsquo;Tis not thy swiftness can secure thy flight;<br />
      Not with their feet, but hands, the valiant fight.<br />
      Vary thy shape in thousand forms, and dare<br />
      What skill and courage can attempt in war;<br />
      Wish for the wings of winds, to mount the sky;<br />
      Or hid, within the hollow earth to lie!&rdquo;<br />
      The champion shook his head, and made this short reply:<br />
      &ldquo;No threats of thine my manly mind can move;<br />
      &rsquo;Tis hostile heav&rsquo;n I dread, and partial Jove.&rdquo;<br />
      He said no more, but, with a sigh, repress&rsquo;d<br />
      The mighty sorrow in his swelling breast.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Then, as he roll&rsquo;d his troubled eyes around,<br />
      An antique stone he saw, the common bound<br />
      Of neighb&rsquo;ring fields, and barrier of the ground;<br />
      So vast, that twelve strong men of modern days<br />
      Th&rsquo; enormous weight from earth could hardly raise.<br />
      He heav&rsquo;d it at a lift, and, pois&rsquo;d on high,<br />
      Ran stagg&rsquo;ring on against his enemy,<br />
      But so disorder&rsquo;d, that he scarcely knew<br />
      His way, or what unwieldly weight he threw.<br />
      His knocking knees are bent beneath the load,<br />
      And shiv&rsquo;ring cold congeals his vital blood.<br />
      The stone drops from his arms, and, falling short<br />
      For want of vigour, mocks his vain effort.<br />
      And as, when heavy sleep has clos&rsquo;d the sight,<br />
      The sickly fancy labours in the night;<br />
      We seem to run; and, destitute of force,<br />
      Our sinking limbs forsake us in the course:<br />
      In vain we heave for breath; in vain we cry;<br />
      The nerves, unbrac&rsquo;d, their usual strength deny;<br />
      And on the tongue the falt&rsquo;ring accents die:<br />
      So Turnus far&rsquo;d; whatever means he tried,<br />
      All force of arms and points of art employ&rsquo;d,<br />
      The Fury flew athwart, and made th&rsquo; endeavor void.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      A thousand various thoughts his soul confound;<br />
      He star&rsquo;d about, nor aid nor issue found;<br />
      His own men stop the pass, and his own walls surround.<br />
      Once more he pauses, and looks out again,<br />
      And seeks the goddess charioteer in vain.<br />
      Trembling he views the thund&rsquo;ring chief advance,<br />
      And brandishing aloft the deadly lance:<br />
      Amaz&rsquo;d he cow&rsquo;rs beneath his conqu&rsquo;ring foe,<br />
      Forgets to ward, and waits the coming blow.<br />
      Astonish&rsquo;d while he stands, and fix&rsquo;d with fear,<br />
      Aim&rsquo;d at his shield he sees th&rsquo; impending spear.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      The hero measur&rsquo;d first, with narrow view,<br />
      The destin&rsquo;d mark; and, rising as he threw,<br />
      With its full swing the fatal weapon flew.<br />
      Not with less rage the rattling thunder falls,<br />
      Or stones from batt&rsquo;ring-engines break the walls:<br />
      Swift as a whirlwind, from an arm so strong,<br />
      The lance drove on, and bore the death along.<br />
      Naught could his sev&rsquo;nfold shield the prince avail,<br />
      Nor aught, beneath his arms, the coat of mail:<br />
      It pierc&rsquo;d thro&rsquo; all, and with a grisly wound<br />
      Transfix&rsquo;d his thigh, and doubled him to ground.<br />
      With groans the Latins rend the vaulted sky:<br />
      Woods, hills, and valleys, to the voice reply.<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      Now low on earth the lofty chief is laid,<br />
      With eyes cast upward, and with arms display&rsquo;d,<br />
      And, recreant, thus to the proud victor pray&rsquo;d:<br />
      &ldquo;I know my death deserv&rsquo;d, nor hope to live:<br />
      Use what the gods and thy good fortune give.<br />
      Yet think, O think, if mercy may be shown,<br />
      Thou hadst a father once, and hast a son.<br />
      Pity my sire, now sinking to the grave;<br />
      And for Anchises&rsquo; sake old Daunus save!<br />
      Or, if thy vow&rsquo;d revenge pursue my death,<br />
      Give to my friends my body void of breath!<br />
      The Latian chiefs have seen me beg my life;<br />
      Thine is the conquest, thine the royal wife:<br />
      Against a yielded man, &rsquo;tis mean ignoble strife.&rdquo;<br />
    </p>

    <p class="poem">
      In deep suspense the Trojan seem&rsquo;d to stand,<br />
      And, just prepar&rsquo;d to strike, repress&rsquo;d his hand.<br />
      He roll&rsquo;d his eyes, and ev&rsquo;ry moment felt<br />
      His manly soul with more compassion melt;<br />
      When, casting down a casual glance, he spied<br />
      The golden belt that glitter&rsquo;d on his side,<br />
      The fatal spoils which haughty Turnus tore<br />
      From dying Pallas, and in triumph wore.<br />
      Then, rous&rsquo;d anew to wrath, he loudly cries<br />
      (Flames, while he spoke, came flashing from his eyes)<br />
      &ldquo;Traitor, dost thou, dost thou to grace pretend,<br />
      Clad, as thou art, in trophies of my friend?<br />
      To his sad soul a grateful off&rsquo;ring go!<br />
      &rsquo;Tis Pallas, Pallas gives this deadly blow.&rdquo;<br />
      He rais&rsquo;d his arm aloft, and, at the word,<br />
      Deep in his bosom drove the shining sword.<br />
      The streaming blood distain&rsquo;d his arms around;<br />
      And the disdainful soul came rushing through the wound.<br />

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
