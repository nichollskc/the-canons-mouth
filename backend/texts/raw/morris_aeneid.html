<h4>&AElig;NEAS AND HIS TROJANS BEING DRIVEN TO LIBYA BY A TEMPEST, HAVE GOOD
WELCOME OF DIDO, QUEEN OF CARTHAGE.</h4>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Lo I am he who led the song through slender reed to cry,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>And then, come forth from out the woods, the fields that are thereby</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>In woven verse I bade obey the hungry tillers' need:</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Now I, who sang their merry toil, sing Mars and dreadful deed.</i><br /></span>
</div></div>


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I sing of arms, I sing of him, who from the Trojan land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thrust forth by Fate, to Italy and that Lavinian strand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First came: all tost about was he on earth and on the deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By heavenly might for Juno's wrath, that had no mind to sleep:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And plenteous war he underwent ere he his town might frame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And set his Gods in Latian earth, whence is the Latin name,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span><span class="i0">And father-folk of Alba-town, and walls of mighty Rome.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Say, Muse, what wound of godhead was whereby all this must come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How grieving, she, the Queen of Gods, a man so pious drave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To win such toil, to welter on through such a troublous wave:</span><span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
<span class="i0">&mdash;Can anger in immortal minds abide so fierce and fell?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There was a city of old time where Tyrian folk did dwell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Called Carthage, facing far away the shores of Italy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Tiber-mouth; fulfilled of wealth and fierce in arms was she,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And men say Juno loved her well o'er every other land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea e'en o'er Samos: there were stored the weapons of her hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there her chariot: even then she cherished the intent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make her Lady of all Lands, if Fate might so be bent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet had she heard how such a stem from Trojan blood should grow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, blooming fair, the Tyrian towers should one day overthrow,</span><span class='linenum'>20</span><br />
<span class="i0">That thence a folk, kings far and wide, most noble lords of fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should come for bane of Libyan land: such web the Parc&aelig; dight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Seed of Saturn, fearing this, and mindful how she erst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For her beloved Argive walls by Troy the battle nursed&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Nay neither had the cause of wrath nor all those hurts of old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Failed from her mind: her inmost heart still sorely did enfold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That grief of body set at nought in Paris' doomful deed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hated race, and honour shed on heaven-rapt Ganymede&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So set on fire, that Trojan band o'er all the ocean tossed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those gleanings from Achilles' rage, those few the Greeks had lost,</span><span class='linenum'>30</span><br />
<span class="i0">She drave far off the Latin Land: for many a year they stray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such wise as Fate would drive them on by every watery way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Lo, what there was to heave aloft in fashioning of Rome!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now out of sight of Sicily the Trojans scarce were come</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span><br />
<span class="i0">And merry spread their sails abroad and clave the sea with brass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Juno's heart, who nursed the wound that never thence would pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spake out:<br /></span>
<span class="i11">"And must I, vanquished, leave the deed I have begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor save the Italian realm a king who comes of Teucer's son?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Fates forbid it me forsooth? And Pallas, might not she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burn up the Argive fleet and sink the Argives in the sea</span><span class='linenum'>40</span><br />
<span class="i0">For Oileus' only fault and fury that he wrought?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She hurled the eager fire of Jove from cloudy dwelling caught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rent the ships and with the wind the heaped-up waters drew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And him a-dying, and all his breast by wildfire smitten through,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The whirl of waters swept away on spiky crag to bide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While I, who go forth Queen of Gods, the very Highest's bride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sister, must I wage a war for all these many years<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one lone race? What! is there left a soul that Juno fears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Henceforth? or will one suppliant hand gifts on mine altar lay?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So brooding in her fiery heart the Goddess went her way</span><span class='linenum'>50</span><br />
<span class="i0">Unto the fatherland of storm, full fruitful of the gale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&AElig;olia hight, where &AElig;olus is king of all avail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And far adown a cavern vast the bickering of the winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And roaring tempests of the world with bolt and fetter binds:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They set the mountains murmuring much, a-growling angrily<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About their bars, while &AElig;olus sits in his burg on high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, sceptre-holding, softeneth them, and strait their wrath doth keep:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea but for that the earth and sea, and vault of heaven the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They eager-swift would roll away and sweep adown of space:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fear whereof the Father high in dark and hollow place</span><span class='linenum'>60</span><br />
<span class="i0">Hath hidden them, and high above a world of mountains thrown</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span><br />
<span class="i0">And given them therewithal a king, who, taught by law well known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now draweth, and now casteth loose the reins that hold them in:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whom did suppliant Juno now in e'en such words begin:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Father of the Gods and men hath given thee might enow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O &AElig;olus, to smooth the sea, and make the storm-wind blow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hearken! a folk, my very foes, saileth the Tyrrhene main<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing their Troy to Italy, and Gods that were but vain:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set on thy winds, and overwhelm their sunken ships at sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or prithee scattered cast them forth, things drowned diversedly.</span><span class='linenum'>70</span><br />
<span class="i0">Twice seven nymphs are in my house of body passing fair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of whom indeed De&iuml;opea is fairest fashioned there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I give her thee in wedlock sure, and call her all thine own<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wear away the years with thee, for thy deserving shown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me this day; of offspring fair she too shall make thee sire."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To whom spake &AElig;olus: "O Queen, to search out thy desire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is all thou needest toil herein; from me the deed should wend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou mak'st my realm; the sway of all, and Jove thou mak'st my friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou givest me to lie with Gods when heavenly feast is dight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er the tempest and the cloud thou makest me of might."</span><span class='linenum'>80</span><br />
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Therewith against the hollow hill he turned him spear in hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hurled it on the flank thereof, and as an ordered band<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By whatso door the winds rush out o'er earth in whirling blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And driving down upon the sea its lowest deeps upcast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The East, the West together there, the Afric, that doth hold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A heart fulfilled of stormy rain, huge billows shoreward rolled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therewith came clamour of the men and whistling through the shrouds</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span><br />
<span class="i0">And heaven and day all suddenly were swallowed by the clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away from eyes of Teucrian men; night on the ocean lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pole thunders unto pole, and still with wildfire glare the skies,</span><span class='linenum'>90</span><br />
<span class="i0">And all things hold the face of death before the seamen's eyes.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now therewithal &AElig;neas' limbs grew weak with chilly dread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He groaned, and lifting both his palms aloft to heaven, he said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"O thrice and four times happy ye, that had the fate to fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before your fathers' faces there by Troy's beloved wall!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tydides, thou of Danaan folk the mightiest under shield,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why might I never lay me down upon the Ilian field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why was my soul forbid release at thy most mighty hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where eager Hector stooped and lay before Achilles' wand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where huge Sarpedon fell asleep, where Simo&iuml;s rolls along</span><span class='linenum'>100</span><br />
<span class="i0">The shields of men, and helms of men, and bodies of the strong?"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus as he cried the whistling North fell on with sudden gale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And drave the seas up toward the stars, and smote aback the sail;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then break the oars, the bows fall off, and beam on in the trough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She lieth, and the sea comes on a mountain huge and rough.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These hang upon the topmost wave, and those may well discern<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea's ground mid the gaping whirl: with sand the surges churn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three keels the South wind cast away on hidden reefs that lie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Midmost the sea, the Altars called by men of Italy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A huge back thrusting through the tide: three others from the deep</span><span class='linenum'>110</span><br />
<span class="i0">The East toward straits, and swallowing sands did miserably sweep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dashed them on the shoals, and heaped the sand around in ring:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And one, a keel the Lycians manned, with him, the trusty King<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Orontes, in &AElig;neas' sight a toppling wave o'erhung,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span><br />
<span class="i0">And smote the poop, and headlong rolled, adown the helmsman flung;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then thrice about the driving flood hath hurled her as she lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hurrying eddy swept above and swallowed her from day:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lo! things swimming here and there, scant in the unmeasured seas,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The arms of men, and painted boards, and Trojan treasuries.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now Ilioneus' stout ship, her that Achates leal</span><span class='linenum'>120</span><br />
<span class="i0">And Abas ferried o'er the main, and old Aletes' keel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The storm hath overcome; and all must drink the baneful stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through opening leaky sides of them that gape at every seam.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But meanwhile Neptune, sorely moved, hath felt the storm let go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the turmoil of the main with murmur great enow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The deep upheaved from all abodes the lowest that there be:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So forth he put his placid face o'er topmost of the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there he saw &AElig;neas' ships o'er all the main besprent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Trojans beaten by the flood and ruin from heaven sent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Juno's guile and wrathful heart her brother knew full well:</span><span class='linenum'>130</span><br />
<span class="i0">So East and West he called to him, and spake such words to tell:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What mighty pride of race of yours hath hold upon your minds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That earth and sea ye turmoil so without my will, O winds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That such upheaval and so great ye dare without my will?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom I&mdash;But first it comes to hand the troubled flood to still:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For such-like fault henceforward though with nought so light ye pay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Go get you gone, and look to it this to your king to say:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That ocean's realm and three-tined spear of dread are given by Fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not unto him but unto me? he holds the cliffs o'ergreat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thine houses, Eurus; in that hall I bid him then be bold,</span><span class='linenum'>140</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thine &AElig;olus, and lord it o'er his winds in barred hold."</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span><br />
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So saying and swifter than his word he layed the troubled main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And put to flight the gathered clouds, and brought the sun again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with him Triton fell to work, and fair Cymotho&euml;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrust the ships from spiky rocks; with triple spear wrought he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lift, and opened swallowing sands, and laid the waves alow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on light wheels o'er ocean's face soft gliding did he go.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, like as mid a people great full often will arise<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All hearkened hushed, and fixed on him was every face of man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As from the couch high set aloft &AElig;neas thus began:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Unutterable grief, O Queen, thou biddest me renew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The falling of the Trojan weal and realm that all shall rue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Neath Danaan might; which thing myself unhappy did behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yea, and was no small part thereof. What man might hear it told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Dolopes, or Myrmidons, or hard Ulysses' band,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And keep the tears back? Dewy night now falleth from the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of heaven, and all the setting stars are bidding us to sleep:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if to know our evil hap thy longing is so deep,</span><span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
<span class="i0">If thou wilt hear a little word of Troy's last agony,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though memory shuddereth, and my heart shrunk up in grief doth lie,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will begin.<br /></span>
<span class="i13">By battle broke, and thrust aback by Fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through all the wearing of the years, the Danaan lords yet wait<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And build a horse up mountain-huge by Pallas' art divine,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span><br />
<span class="i0">Fair fashioning the ribs thereof with timbers of the pine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feign it vowed for safe return, and let the fame fly forth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Herein by stealth a sort of men chosen for bodies' worth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid its darkness do they shut; the caverns inly lost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep in the belly of the thing they fill with armed host.</span><span class='linenum'>20</span><br />
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an island known of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rich in wealth before the realm of Priam had its fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now but a bay and roadstead poor, where scarcely ships may ride.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So thither now they sail away in desert place to hide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We thought them gone, and that they sought Mycen&aelig; on a wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereat the long-drawn grief of Troy fell off from every mind.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The gates are opened; sweet it is the Dorian camp to see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dwellings waste, the shore all void where they were wont to be:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here dwelt the band of Dolopes, here was Achilles set,</span><span class='linenum'>29</span><br />
<span class="i0">And this was where their ships were beached; here edge to edge we met.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some wonder at unwedded maid Minerva's gift of death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That baneful mountain of a horse; and first Thym&oelig;tes saith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twere good in walls to lead the thing, on topmost burg to stand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether such word the fate of Troy or evil treason planned<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not: Capys and the rest, who better counsel have,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bid take the fashioned guile of Greeks, the doubtful gift they gave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To tumble it adown to sea, with piled-up fire to burn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or bore the belly of the beast its hidden holes to learn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So cleft atwain is rede of men abiding there in doubt.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But first before all others now with much folk all about</span><span class='linenum'>40</span><br />
<span class="i0">Laocoon the fiery man runs from the burg adown,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span><br />
<span class="i0">And shouts from far:<br /></span>
<span class="i20">'O wretched men, how hath such madness grown?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deem ye the foe hath fared away? Deem ye that Danaan gifts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May ever lack due share of guile? Are these Ulysses' shifts?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For either the Ach&aelig;ans lurk within this fashioned tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or 'tis an engine wrought with craft bane of our walls to be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To look into our very homes, and scale the town perforce:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some guile at least therein abides: Teucrians, trust not the horse!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whatso it is, the Danaan folk, yea gift-bearing I fear.'</span><span class='linenum'>49</span><br />
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus having said, with valiant might he hurled a huge-wrought spear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the belly of the beast swelled out with rib and stave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It stood a-trembling therewithal; its hollow caverns gave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From womb all shaken with the stroke a mighty sounding groan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And but for God's heart turned from us, for God's fate fixed and known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would have led us on with steel to foul the Argive den,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thou, O Troy, wert standing now, thou Priam's burg as then!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But lo, where Dardan shepherds lead, with plenteous clamour round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A young man unto Priam's place with hands behind him bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who privily had thrust himself before their way e'en now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The work to crown, and into Troy an open way to show</span><span class='linenum'>60</span><br />
<span class="i0">Unto the Greeks; a steadfast soul, prepared for either end,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or utterly to work his craft or unto death to bend.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eager to see him as he went around the Trojans flock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On every side, and each with each contend the man to mock.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo now, behold the Danaan guile, and from one wrong they wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learn ye what all are like to be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For as he stood in sight of all, bewildered, weaponless,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span><br />
<span class="i0">And let his eyes go all around the gazing Phrygian press,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spake:<br /></span>
<span class="i9">'What land shall have me now, what sea my head shall hide?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What then is left of deed to do that yet I must abide?</span><span class='linenum'>70</span><br />
<span class="i0">No place I have among the Greeks, and Dardan folk withal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My foemen are, and bloody end, due doom, upon me call.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And with that wail our hearts were turned, and somewhat backward hung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The press of men: we bade him say from whence his blood was sprung,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what he did, and if indeed a captive we might trust;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So thus he spake when now all fear from off his heart was thrust:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Whatso betide, to thee, O King, the matter's verity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will I lay bare unto the end, nor Argive blood deny:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This firstly; for if Fate indeed shaped Sinon for all bale<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Perchance a rumour of men's talk about your ears hath gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Telling of Palamedes' fame and glory that he won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The son of Belus: traitors' word undid him innocent;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By unjust doom for banning war the way of death he went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slain by Pelasgian men, that now his quench&egrave;d light deplore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fellow to him, and nigh akin, I went unto the war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent by my needy father forth, e'en from my earliest years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now while he reigned in health, a king fair blooming mid his peers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In council of the kings, I too had share of name and worth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But after he had gone his way from land of upper earth,</span><span class='linenum'>90</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thrust down by sly Ulysses' hate, (I tell all men's belief),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then beaten down I dragged my life through shadowy ways of grief,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heavily I took the death of him my sackless friend,</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span><br />
<span class="i0">Nor held my peace, O fool! but vowed revenge if time should send<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A happy tide; if I should come to Argos any more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A victor then: so with my words I drew down hatred sore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was the first fleck of my ill; Ulysses ever now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would threaten with some new-found guilt, and mid the folk would sow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark sayings, and knowing what was toward, sought weapons new at need;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wearied till with Calchas now to help him to the deed.&mdash;</span><span class='linenum'>100</span><br />
<span class="i0">&mdash;But why upturn these ugly things, or spin out time for nought?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if ye deem all Greekish men in one same mould are wrought:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is enough. Come make an end; Ulysses' hope fulfil!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With great price would the Atrid&aelig; buy such working of their will.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then verily to know the thing and reach it deep we burned,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So little in Pelasgian guile and evil were we learned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He takes the tale up; fluttering-voiced from lying heart he speaks:<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'The longing to be gone from Troy fell oft upon the Greeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oft they fain had turned their backs on war without an end,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A tempest would forbid the sea, or southern gale would scare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chiefly when with maple-beams this horse that standeth here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fashioned, mighty din of storm did all the heavens fulfil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So held aback, Eurypylus we sent to learn the will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Ph&oelig;bus: from the shrine he brought such heavy words as these:<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With blood and with a virgin's death did ye the winds appease</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>When first ye came, O Danaan folk, unto the Ilian shore;</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>With blood and with an Argive soul the Gods shall ye adore</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>For your return.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i16">'Now when that word men's ears had gone about</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span><br />
<span class="i0">Their hearts stood still, and tremors cold took all their bones for doubt<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Twice five days Calchas holdeth peace and, hidden, gainsayeth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speak the word that any man to very death should cast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till hardly, by Ulysses' noise sore driven, at the last<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now after it had pleased the Gods on high to overthrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Asian weal and sackless folk of Priam, and alow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proud Ilium lay, and Neptune's Troy was smouldering on the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For diverse outlands of the earth and waste lands are we bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Driven by omens of the Gods. Our fleet we built beneath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Antandros, and the broken steeps of Phrygian Ida's heath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unwitting whither Fate may drive, or where the Gods shall stay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there we draw together men.<br /></span>
<span class="i36">Now scarce upon the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was summer when my father bade spread sails to Fate at last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Weeping I leave my fatherland, and out of haven passed</span><span class='linenum'>10</span><br />
<span class="i0">Away from fields where Troy-town was, an outcast o'er the deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With folk and son and Household Gods and Greater Gods to keep.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Far off a peopled land of Mars lies midst its mighty plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tilled of the Thracians; there whilom did fierce Lycurgus reign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twas ancient guesting-place of Troy: our Gods went hand in hand</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span><br />
<span class="i0">While bloomed our weal: there are we borne, and on the hollow strand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I set my first-born city down, 'neath evil fates begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And call the folk &AElig;nead&aelig; from name myself had won.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Unto Dione's daughter there, my mother, and the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sacrificed upon a day to gain beginning blest,</span><span class='linenum'>20</span><br />
<span class="i0">And to the King of Heavenly folk was slaying on the shore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glorious bull: at hand by chance a mound at topmost bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cornel-bush and myrtle stiff with shafts close set around:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereto I wend and strive to pluck a green shoot from the ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I with leafy boughs thereof may clothe the altars well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When lo, a portent terrible and marvellous to tell!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the first stem that from the soil uprooted I tear out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oozes black drops of very blood, that all the earth about<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is stained with gore: but as for me, with sudden horror chill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My limbs fall quaking, and my blood with freezing fear stands still.</span><span class='linenum'>30</span><br />
<span class="i0">Yet I go on and strive from earth a new tough shoot to win,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I may search out suddenly what causes lurk within;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And once again from out the bark blood followeth as before.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I turn the matter in my mind: the Field-Nymphs I adore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And him, Gradivus, father dread, who rules the Thracian plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pray them turn the thing to good and make its threatenings vain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when upon a third of them once more I set my hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And striving hard thrust both my knees upon the opposing sand&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;Shall I speak now or hold my peace?&mdash;a piteous groan is heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From out the mound, and to mine ears is borne a dreadful word:</span><span class='linenum'>40</span><br />
<span class="i0">'Why manglest thou a wretched man? O spare me in my tomb!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spare to beguilt thy righteous hand, &AElig;neas! Troy's own womb</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span><br />
<span class="i0">Bore me, thy kinsman; from this stem floweth no alien gore:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woe's me! flee forth the cruel land, flee forth the greedy shore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I am Polydore: pierced through, by harvest of the spear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'ergrown, that such a crop of shafts above my head doth bear.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I stood amazed: the wildering fear the heart in me down-weighed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My hair rose up, my frozen breath within my jaws was stayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unhappy Priam privily had sent this Polydore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For fostering to the Thracian king with plenteous golden store.</span><span class='linenum'>50</span><br />
<span class="i0">In those first days when he began to doubt the Dardan might,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Having the leaguered walls of Troy for ever in his sight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This king, as failed the weal of Troy and fortune fell away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned him about to conquering arms and Agamemnon's day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He brake all right, slew Polydore, and all the gold he got<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perforce: O thou gold-hunger cursed, and whither driv'st thou not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hearts of men?<br /></span>
<span class="i18">But when at length the fear from me did fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto the chosen of the folk, my father first of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I show those portents of the Gods and ask them of their will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All deem it good that we depart that wicked land of ill,</span><span class='linenum'>60</span><br />
<span class="i0">And leave that blighted guesting-place and give our ships the breeze.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore to Polydore we do the funeral services,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth is heaped up high in mound; the Death-Gods' altars stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Woeful with bough of cypress black and coal-blue holy band;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wives of Ilium range about with due dishevelled hair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cups of the warm and foaming milk unto the dead we bear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bowls of holy blood we bring, and lay the soul in grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cry a great farewell to him, the last that he shall have.</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span><br />
<span class="i0">But now, when we may trust the sea and winds the ocean keep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unangered, and the South bids on light whispering to the deep,</span><span class='linenum'>70</span><br />
<span class="i0">Our fellows crowd the sea-beach o'er and run the ships adown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from the haven are we borne, and fadeth field and town.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Amid the sea a land there lies, sweet over everything,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Loved of the Nereids' mother, loved by that &AElig;gean king<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Great Neptune: this, a-wandering once all coasts and shores around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Bow-Lord good to Gyaros and high Myconos bound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bade it fixed to cherish folk nor fear the wind again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There come we; and that gentlest isle receives us weary men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In haven safe we land, and thence Apollo's town adore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King Anius, who, a king of men, Apollo's priesthood bore,</span><span class='linenum'>80</span><br />
<span class="i0">His temples with the fillets done and crowned with holy bays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Meets us, and straight Anchises knows, his friend of early days.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So therewith hand to hand we join and houseward get us gone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There the God's fane I pray unto, the place of ancient stone:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Thymbr&aelig;an, give us house and home, walls to the weary give,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In folk and city to endure: let Pergamus twice live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Troy twice built, left of the Greeks, left of Achilles' wrath!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, whom to follow? where to go? wherein our home set forth?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Father, give us augury and sink into our heart!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Scarce had I said the word, when lo all doors with sudden start</span><span class='linenum'>90</span><br />
<span class="i0">Fell trembling, and the bay of God, and all the mountain side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was stirred, and in the opened shrine the holy tripod cried:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There as a voice fell on our ears we bowed ourselves to earth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'O hardy folk of Dardanus, the land that gave you birth</span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span><br />
<span class="i0">From root and stem of fathers old, its very bosom kind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There shall &AElig;neas' house be lords o'er every earth and sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The children of his children's sons, and those that thence shall be.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So Ph&oelig;bus spake, and mighty joy arose with tumult mixed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As all fell wondering where might be that seat of city fixed,</span><span class='linenum'>100</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where Ph&oelig;bus called us wandering folk, bidding us turn again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thereat my father, musing o'er the tales of ancient men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Saith: 'Hearken, lords, and this your hope a little learn of me!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is an isle of mightiest Jove called Crete amid the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An hundred cities great it hath, that most abundant place;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there the hill of Ida is, and cradle of our race.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence Teucer our first father came, if right the tale they tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When borne to those Rh&oelig;tean shores he chose a place to dwell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A very king: no Ilium was, no Pergamus rose high;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He and his folk abode as then in dales that lowly lie:</span><span class='linenum'>110</span><br />
<span class="i0">Thence came Earth-mother Cybele and Corybantian brass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Ida's thicket; thence the hush all hallowed came to pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thence the lions yoked and tame, the Lady's chariot drag.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On then! and led by God's command for nothing let us lag!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Please we the winds, and let our course for Gnosian land be laid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor long the way shall be for us: with Jupiter to aid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The third-born sun shall stay our ships upon the Cretan shore.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So saying, all the offerings due he to the altar bore,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span><span class="i0">A bull to Neptune, and a bull to thee, Apollo bright,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Fame went that Duke Idomeneus, thrust from his fathers' land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had gone his ways, and desert now was all the Cretan strand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That left all void of foes to us those habitations lie.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ortygia's haven then we leave, and o'er the sea we fly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Naxos of the Bacchus ridge, Donusa's green-hued steep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Olearon, and Paros white, and scattered o'er the deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All Cyclades; we skim the straits besprent with many a folk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And diverse clamour mid the ships seafarers striving woke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each eggs his fellow; On for Crete, and sires of time agone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rising up upon our wake a fair wind followed on.</span><span class='linenum'>130</span><br />
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Unhappy Dido burneth up, and, wild with all unrest,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He spake, and from his back he cast his twifold cloak adown,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And on the midmost of the sand a giant there he stood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherewith Anchises' seed brought forth gloves even-matched and good,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then straightway each one stretched aloft on tip-toe from the ground:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They cast their mighty arms abroad, nor any fear they know,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The other's bulk of all avail, but, trembling, ever shrank<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Full many a stroke those mighty men cast each at each in vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thick fall they on the hollow sides; the breasts ring out again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With mighty sound; and eager-swift the hands full often stray<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round ears and temples; crack the jaws beneath that heavy play:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one set strain, not moving aught, heavy Entellus stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By body's sway and watchful eye shunning the dart of hands:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Dares is as one who brings the gin 'gainst high-built town,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Above him, and his body swift writhed skew-wise from the fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Entellus spends his stroke on air, and, overborne withal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A heavy thing, falls heavily to earth, a mighty weight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As whiles a hollow-eaten pine on Erymanthus great,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then Teucrian and Trinacrian folk with wondrous longing rose,</span><span class='linenum'>450</span><br />
<span class="i0">And shouts went skyward: thither first the King Acestes ran,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who neither slackened by his fall, nor smit by any fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gets back the eagerer to the fight, for anger strength doth stir,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shame and conscious valour lights his ancient power again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In headlong flight his fiery wrath drives Dares o'er the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whiles his right hand showereth strokes, his left hand raineth whiles.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No tarrying and no rest there is; as hail-storm on the tiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rattleth, so swift with either hand the eager hero now<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Entellus' bitter rage of soul or lengthening anger's tide,<br /></span>

<span class="i20">So 'neath his word the battle sank to peace.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Where the huge side of Cum&aelig;'s rock is carven in a den,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Be not o'ereager in your haste: the hour of fight shall come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When dreadful Carthage on a day against the walls of Rome,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But this one let me shield, and take safe from the battle's dread.</span><span class='linenum'>50</span><br />
<span class="i0">Paphus, Cythera, Amathus, are mine, and I abide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within Idalia's house: let him lay weed of war aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wear his life inglorious there: then shalt thou bid the hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Carthage weigh Ausonia down, and nothing shall withstand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The towns of Tyre.&mdash;Ah, what availed to 'scape the bane of war?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, what availed that through the midst of Argive flames they bore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wear down perils of wide lands, and perils of the main,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While Teucrian men sought Latin land and Troy new-born again?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, better had it been for them by Troy's cold ash to stay,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Their Xanthus and their Simo&iuml;s unto that wretched folk,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then spake Queen Juno, heavy wroth: "Why driv'st thou me to part<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Spurned by Cassandra's wilderment&mdash;and how then counselled we<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What! we it was who strove to wrack the fainting Trojan weal?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We!&mdash;or the one who thwart the Greeks the wretched Trojans dashed?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then had thy care for thine been meet, but now indeed o'erlate<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So pleaded Juno, and all they, the heavenly folk anigh,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Turnus sees the Latin men all failing from the sword,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broken by Mars, and that all folk bethink them of his word,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And raises up his heart aloft; e'en as in Punic mead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smitten lion, hurt in breast by steel from hunters' ring,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Breaks off the clinging robber-spear, and roars from mouth of blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">E'en so o'er Turnus' fiery heart the tide of fury wins,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To none of all her wooers of old my daughter may I wed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This warning word of prophecy all men and Gods have sped.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What mishaps and what wrack of peace have been my due reward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou seest, Turnus, and what grief I was the first to bear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twice beaten in a woeful fight, scarce is our city here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held by the hope of Italy: still Tiber-flood rolls by,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But whither waver I so oft? what folly shifts my mind?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I am ready, Turnus dead, peace with these men to bind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I not rather while thou liv'st cast all the war away?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What shall my kindred Rutuli, what shall Italia say,</span><span class='linenum'>40</span><br />

<span class="i0">"Thy trouble for my sake, best lord, e'en for my sake forsooth,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But now the Queen, by this new chance of battle sore afraid,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Anigh thy heart; O, only hope of this my latter tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sole rest from sorrow! thou, in whom all worship doth abide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All glory of the Latin name, our falling house-wall stay!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Let Latium and the Alban kings through many an age abide,<br /></span>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
