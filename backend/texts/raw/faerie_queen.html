<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
<a name="Intro_I"></a>
<h3>I. THE AGE WHICH PRODUCED THE <i>FAERIE QUEENE</i></h3>

  <p>The study of the <i>Faerie Queene</i> should be preceded by a review
  of the great age in which it was written. An intimate relation exists
  between the history of the English nation and the works of English
  authors. This close connection between purely external events and
  literary masterpieces is especially marked in a study of the Elizabethan
  Age. To understand the marvelous outburst of song, the incomparable
  drama, and the stately prose of this period, one must enter deeply into
  the political, social, and religious life of the times.</p>

  <p>The <i>Faerie Queene</i> was the product of certain definite
  conditions which existed in England toward the close of the sixteenth
  century. The first of these national conditions was the movement known as
  the <i>revival of chivalry</i>; the second was the <i>spirit of
  nationality</i> fostered by the English Reformation; and the third was
  that phase of the English Renaissance commonly called the <i>revival of
  learning</i>.</p>

  <p>The closing decade of Queen Elizabeth's reign was marked by a strong
  reaction toward romanticism. The feudal system with its many
  imperfections had become a memory, and had been idealized by the people.
  The nation felt pride in its new aristocracy, sprung largely from the
  middle class, and based rather on worth than ancestry. The bitterness of
  the Wars of the Roses was forgotten, and was succeeded by an era of
  reconciliation and good feeling. England was united in a heroic queen
  whom all sects, ranks, and parties idolized. The whole country exulting
  in its new sense of freedom and power became a fairyland of youth,
  springtime, and romantic achievement.</p>

  <p>Wise and gallant courtiers, like Sidney, Leicester, and Raleigh,
  gathered about the queen, and formed a new chivalry devoted to deeds of
  adventure and exploits of mind in her honor. The spirit of the old
  sea-kings lived again in Drake and his bold buccaneers, who swept the
  proud Spaniards from the seas. With the defeat of the Invincible Armada,
  the greatest naval expedition of modern times, the fear of Spanish and
  Catholic domination rolled away. The whole land was saturated with an
  unexpressed poetry, and the imagination of young and old was so fired
  with patriotism and noble endeavor that nothing seemed impossible. Add to
  this intense delight in life, with all its mystery, beauty, and power,
  the keen zest for learning which filled the air that men breathed, and it
  is easy to understand that the time was ripe for a new and brilliant
  epoch in literature. First among the poetic geniuses of the Elizabethan
  period came Edmund Spenser with his <i>Faerie Queene</i>, the allegory of
  an ideal chivalry.</p>

  <p>This poem is one of the fruits of that intellectual awakening which
  first fertilized Italian thought in the twelfth century, and, slowly
  spreading over Europe, made its way into England in the fifteenth
  century. The mighty impulse of this New Learning culminated during the
  reign of the Virgin Queen in a profound quickening of the national
  consciousness, and in arousing an intense curiosity to know and to
  imitate the rich treasures of the classics and romance. Its first phase
  was the <i>classical revival</i>. The tyrannous authority of
  ecclesiasticism had long since been broken; a general reaction from
  Christian asceticism had set in; and by the side of the ceremonies of the
  church had been introduced a semi-pagan religion of art&mdash;the worship
  of moral and sensuous beauty. Illiteracy was no longer the style at
  court. Elizabeth herself set the example in the study of Greek. Books and
  manuscripts were eagerly sought after, Scholars became conversant with
  Homer, Plato, Aristotle, and the great tragic poets Sophocles, Euripides,
  and Æschylus; and translations for the many of Vergil, Ovid, Plautus,
  Terence, and Seneca poured forth from the printing-presses of London. The
  English mind was strongly tempered by the idealistic philosophy of Plato
  and Aristotle, and the influence of Latin tragedy and comedy was strongly
  felt by the early English drama.</p>

  <p>Along with this classical culture came a higher appreciation of the
  <i>beauty of mediævalism</i>. The romantic tendency of the age fostered
  the study of the great epics of chivalry, Ariosto's <i>Orlando
  Furioso</i> and Tasso's <i>Jerusalem Delivered</i>, and of the cycles of
  French romance. From the Italian poets especially Spenser borrowed
  freely. Ariosto's fresh naturalness and magic machinery influenced him
  most strongly, but he was indebted to the semi-classical Tasso for whole
  scenes. On the whole, therefore, Spenser's literary affinities were more
  with the Gothic than the classical.</p>

  <p>Spenser was also the spokesman of his time on religious questions. The
  violent controversies of the Reformation period were over. Having turned
  from the beliefs of ages with passionate rejection, the English people
  had achieved religious freedom, and were strongly rooted in
  Protestantism, which took on a distinctly national aspect. That Calvinism
  was at that time the popular and aristocratic form of Protestantism is
  evident from references in the <i>Faerie Queene</i>.</p>

  <p>Spenser lived in the afterglow of the great age of chivalry. The
  passing glories of knighthood in its flower impressed his imagination
  like a gorgeous dream, and he was thus inspired to catch and crystallize
  into permanent art its romantic spirit and heroic deeds. Into the
  framework of his romance of chivalry he inserted a veiled picture of the
  struggles and sufferings of his own people in Ireland. The <i>Faerie
  Queene</i> might almost be called the epic of the English conquest of
  Ireland. The poet himself and many of his friends were in that unhappy
  island as representatives of the queen's government, trying to pacify the
  natives, and establish law and order out of discontent and anarchy.
  Spenser's poem was written for the most part amidst all these scenes of
  misery and disorder, and the courage, justice, and energy shown by his
  countrymen were aptly portrayed under the allegory of a mighty spiritual
  warfare of the knights of old against the power of evil.</p>

  <p>Spenser's essay on <i>A View of the Present State of Ireland</i> shows
  that, far from shutting himself up in a fool's paradise of fancy, he was
  fully awake to the social and political condition of that turbulent
  island, and that it furnished him with concrete examples of those vices
  and virtues, bold encounters and hair-breadth escapes, strange wanderings
  and deeds of violence, with which he has crowded the allegory of the
  <i>Faerie Queene</i>.</p>

<a name="Intro_II"></a>
<h3>II. THE AUTHOR OF THE <i>FAERIE QUEENE</i></h3>

  <p>Edmund Spenser was born in London near the Tower in the year 1552. His
  parents were poor, though they were probably connected with the
  Lancashire branch of the old family of Le Despensers, "an house of
  ancient fame," from which the Northampton Spencers were also descended.
  The poet's familiarity with the rural life and dialect of the north
  country supports the theory that as a boy he spent some time in
  Lancashire. Beyond two or three facts, nothing is known with certainty of
  his early years. He himself tells us that his mother's name was
  Elizabeth, and that London was his "most kindly nurse." His name is
  mentioned as one of six poor pupils of the Merchant Taylors' School, who
  received assistance from a generous country squire.</p>

  <p>At the age of seventeen, Master Edmund became a student in Pembroke
  Hall, one of the colleges of the great University of Cambridge. His
  position was that of a sizar, or paid scholar, who was exempt from the
  payment of tuition fees and earned his way by serving in the dining hall
  or performing other menial duties. His poverty, however, did not prevent
  him from forming many helpful friendships with his fellow-students. Among
  his most valued friends he numbered Launcelot Andrews, afterward Bishop
  of Winchester, Edward Kirke, a young man of Spenser's own age, who soon
  after edited his friend's first important poem, the <i>Shepheards
  Calender</i>, with elaborate notes, and most important of all, the famous
  classical scholar, a fellow of Pembroke, Gabriel Harvey, who was a few
  years older than Spenser, and was later immortalized as the Hobbinoll of
  the <i>Faerie Queene</i>. It was by Harvey that the poet was introduced
  to Sir Philip Sidney, the most accomplished gentleman in England, and a
  favorite of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>Spenser's residence in Cambridge extended over seven years, during
  which he received the usual degrees of bachelor and master of arts. He
  became one of the most learned of English poets, and we may infer that
  while at this seat of learning he laid the foundations for his wide
  scholarship in the diligent study of the Greek and Latin classics, the
  philosophy of Plato and Aristotle, the pastoral poetry of Theocritus and
  Vergil, and the great mediæval epics of Italian literature. On account of
  some misunderstanding with the master and tutors of his college, Spenser
  failed to receive the appointment to a fellowship, and left the
  University in 1576, at the age of twenty-four. His failure to attain the
  highest scholastic recognition was due, it is supposed, to his being
  involved in some of the dangerous controversies which were ripe in
  Cambridge at that time "with daily spawning of new opinions and heresies
  in divinity, in philosophy, in humanity, and in manners."</p>

  <p>On leaving the University, Spenser resided for about a year with
  relatives in Lancashire, where he found employment. During this time he
  had an unrequited love affair with an unknown beauty whom he celebrated
  in the <i>Shepheards Calender</i> under the name of Rosalind, "the
  widow's daughter of the glen." A rival, Menalchas, was more successful in
  finding favor with his fair neighbor. Although he had before this turned
  his attention to poetry by translating the sonnets of Petrarch and Du
  Bellay (published in 1569), it was while here in the North country that
  he first showed his high poetic gifts in original composition.</p>

  <p>After a visit to Sir Philip Sidney at Penshurst, Spenser went down to
  London with his friend in 1578, and was presented to Sidney's great
  uncle, the Earl of Leicester. He thus at once had an opportunity for
  advancement through the influence of powerful patrons, a necessity with
  poor young authors in that age. An immediate result of his acquaintance
  with Sidney, with whom he was now on relations of intimate friendship,
  was an introduction into the best society of the metropolis. This period
  of association with many of the most distinguished and cultivated men in
  England, together with the succession of brilliant pageants, masks, and
  processions, which he witnessed at court and at Lord Leicester's mansion,
  must have done much to refine his tastes and broaden his outlook on the
  world.</p>

  <p>In personal appearance Spenser was a fine type of a sixteenth century
  gentleman. The grace and dignity of his bearing was enhanced by a face of
  tender and thoughtful expression in which warmth of feeling was subdued
  by the informing spirit of refinement, truthfulness, simplicity, and
  nobility. He possessed a fine dome-like forehead, curling hair, brown
  eyes, full sensuous lips, and a nose that was straight and strongly
  moulded. His long spare face was adorned with a full mustache and a
  closely cropped Van Dyke beard.</p>

  <p>The <i>Shepheards Calender</i> was published in the winter of 1579
  with a grateful and complimentary dedication to Sidney. It is an academic
  exercise consisting of a series of twelve pastoral poems in imitation of
  the eclogues of Vergil and Theocritus. The poem is cast in the form of
  dialogues between shepherds, who converse on such subjects as love,
  religion, and old age. In three eclogues the poet attacks with Puritan
  zeal the pomp and sloth of the worldly clergy, and one is devoted to the
  courtly praise of the queen. It was at once recognized as the most
  notable poem that had appeared since the death of Chaucer, and placed
  Spenser immediately at the head of living English poets.</p>

  <p>In 1580 Spenser went over to Ireland as private secretary to Lord Grey
  of Wilton, the Artegall of the Legend of Justice in the <i>Faerie
  Queene</i>. After the recall of his patron he remained in that turbulent
  island in various civil positions for the rest of his life, with the
  exception of two or three visits and a last sad flight to England. For
  seven years he was clerk of the Court of Chancery in Dublin, and then was
  appointed clerk to the Council of Munster. In 1586 he was granted the
  forfeited estate of the Earl of Desmond in Cork County, and two years
  later took up his residence in Kilcolman Castle, which was beautifully
  situated on a lake with a distant view of mountains. In the disturbed
  political condition of the country, life here seemed a sort of exile to
  the poet, but its very loneliness and danger gave the stimulus needed for
  the development of his peculiar genius.</p>

  <p>"Here," says Mr. Stopford Brooke, "at the foot of the Galtees, and
  bordered to the north by the wild country, the scenery of which is
  frequently painted in the <i>Faerie Queene</i> and in whose woods and
  savage places such adventures constantly took place in the service of
  Elizabeth as are recorded in the <i>Faerie Queene</i>, the first three
  books of that great poem were finished." Spenser had spent the first
  three years of his residence at Kilcolman at work on this masterpiece,
  which had been begun in England, under the encouragement of Sidney,
  probably before 1580. The knightly Sidney died heroically at the battle
  of Zutphen, in 1586, and Spenser voiced the lament of all England in the
  beautiful pastoral elegy <i>Astrophel</i> which he composed in memory of
  "the most noble and valorous knight."</p>

  <p>Soon after coming to Ireland, Spenser made the acquaintance of Sir
  Walter Raleigh, which erelong ripened into intimate friendship. A
  memorable visit from Raleigh, who was now a neighbor of the poet's,
  having also received a part of the forfeited Desmond estate, led to the
  publication of the <i>Faerie Queene</i>. Sitting under the shade "of the
  green alders of the Mulla's shore," Spenser read to his guest the first
  books of his poem. So pleased was Raleigh that he persuaded the poet to
  accompany him to London, and there lay his poem at the feet of the great
  queen, whose praises he had so gloriously sung. The trip was made,
  Spenser was presented to Elizabeth, and read to her Majesty the three
  Legends of Holiness, Temperance, and Chastity. She was delighted with the
  fragmentary epic in which she heard herself delicately complimented in
  turn as Gloriana, Belphoebe, and Britomart, conferred upon the poet a
  pension of £50 yearly, and permitted the <i>Faerie Queene</i> to be
  published with a dedication to herself. Launched under such auspices, it
  is no wonder that the poem was received by the court and all England with
  unprecedented applause.</p>

  <p>The next year while still in London, Spenser collected his early poems
  and issued them under the title of <i>Complaints</i>. In this volume were
  the <i>Ruins of Time</i> and the <i>Tears of the Muses</i>, two poems on
  the indifference shown to literature before 1580, and the remarkable
  <i>Mother Hubberds Tale</i>, a bitter satire on the army, the court, the
  church, and politics. His <i>Daphnaida</i> was also published about the
  same time. On his return to Ireland he gave a charming picture of life at
  Kilcolman Castle, with an account of his visit to the court, in <i>Colin
  Clout's Come Home Again</i>. The story of the long and desperate
  courtship of his second love, Elizabeth, whom he wedded in 1594, is told
  in the <i>Amoretti</i>, a sonnet sequence full of passion and tenderness.
  His rapturous wedding ode, the <i>Epithalamion</i>, which is, by general
  consent, the most glorious bridal song in our language, and the most
  perfect of all his poems in its freshness, purity, and passion, was also
  published in 1595. The next year Spenser was back in London and published
  the <i>Prothalamion</i>, a lovely ode on the marriage of Lord Worcester's
  daughters, and his four <i>Hymns</i> on Love and Beauty, Heavenly Love,
  and Heavenly Beauty. The first two <i>Hymns</i> are early poems, and the
  two latter maturer work embodying Petrarch's philosophy, which teaches
  that earthly love is a ladder that leads men to the love of God. In this
  year, 1596, also appeared the last three books of the <i>Faerie
  Queene</i>, containing the Legends of Friendship, Justice, and
  Courtesy.</p>

  <p>At the height of his fame, happiness, and prosperity, Spenser returned
  for the last time to Ireland in 1597, and was recommended by the queen
  for the office of Sheriff of Cork. Surrounded by his beloved wife and
  children, his domestic life was serene and happy, but in gloomy contrast
  his public life was stormy and full of anxiety and danger. He was the
  acknowledged prince of living poets, and was planning the completion of
  his mighty epic of the private virtues in twelve books, to be followed by
  twelve more on the civic virtues. The native Irish had steadily withstood
  his claim to the estate, and continually harassed him with lawsuits. They
  detested their foreign oppressors and awaited a favorable opportunity to
  rise. Discord and riot increased on all sides. The ever growing murmurs
  of discontent gave place to cries for vengeance and unrepressed acts of
  hostility. Finally, in the fall of 1598, there occurred a fearful
  uprising known as Tyrone's Rebellion, in which the outraged peasants
  fiercely attacked the castle, plundering and burning. Spenser and his
  family barely escaped with their lives. According to one old tradition,
  an infant child was left behind in the hurried flight and perished in the
  flames; but this has been shown to be but one of the wild rumors repeated
  to exaggerate the horror of the uprising. Long after Spenser's death, it
  was also rumored that the last six books of the <i>Faerie Queene</i> had
  been lost in the flight; but the story is now utterly discredited.</p>

  <p>Spenser once more arrived in London, but he was now in dire distress
  and prostrated by the hardships which he had suffered. There on January
  16, 1599, at a tavern in King Street, Westminster, the great poet died
  broken-hearted and in poverty. Drummond of Hawthornden states that Ben
  Jonson told him that Spenser "died for lack of bread in King Street, and
  refused 20 pieces sent to him by my Lord of Essex, and said He was sorrie
  he had no time to spend them." The story is probably a bit of exaggerated
  gossip. He was buried close to the tomb of Chaucer in the Poets' Corner
  in Westminster Abbey, his fellow-poets bearing the pall, and the Earl of
  Essex defraying the expenses of the funeral. Referring to the death of
  Spenser's great contemporary, Basse wrote:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Renownèd Spenser, lie a thought more nigh</p>
      <p>To learnèd Chaucer, and rare Beaumont, lie</p>
      <p>A little nearer Spenser, to make room</p>
      <p>For Shakespeare in your threefold, fourfold tomb."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>"Thus," says Mr. Stopford Brooke, appropriately, "London, 'his most
  kindly nurse,' takes care also of his dust, and England keeps him in her
  love."</p>

  <p>Spenser's influence on English poetry can hardly be overestimated.
  Keats called him "the poets' poet," a title which has been universally
  approved. "He is the poet of all others," says Mr. Saintsbury, "for those
  who seek in poetry only poetical qualities." His work has appealed most
  strongly to those who have been poets themselves, for with him the
  poetical attraction is supreme. Many of the greatest poets have delighted
  to call him master, and have shown him the same loving reverence which he
  gave to Chaucer. Minor poets like Sidney, Drayton, and Daniel paid
  tribute to his inspiration; Milton was deeply indebted to him, especially
  in <i>Lycidas</i>; and many of the pensive poets of the seventeenth
  century show traces of his influence. "Spenser delighted Shakespeare,"
  says Mr. Church; "he was the poetical master of Cowley, and then of
  Milton, and in a sense of Dryden, and even Pope." Giles and Phineas
  Fletcher, William Browne, Sir William Alexander, Shenstone, Collins,
  Cowley, Gray, and James Thomson were all direct followers of Spenser. His
  influence upon the poets of the romantic revival of the nineteenth
  century is even more marked. "Spenser begot Keats," says Mr. Saintsbury,
  "and Keats begot Tennyson, and Tennyson begot all the rest." Among this
  notable company of disciples should be mentioned especially Rossetti,
  Morris, and Swinburne. If we include within the sphere of Spenser's
  influence also those who have made use of the stanza which he invented,
  we must add the names of Burns, Shelley, Byron, Beattie, Campbell, Scott,
  and Wordsworth. When we consider the large number of poets in whom
  Spenser awakened the poetic gift, or those to whose powers he gave
  direction, we may safely pronounce him the most seminal poet in the
  language.</p>

<h3>III. STUDY OF THE <i>FAERIE QUEENE</i></h3>

  <p>1. A ROMANTIC EPIC.&mdash;The <i>Faerie Queene</i> is the most perfect
  type which we have in English of the purely <i>romantic poem</i>. Four
  elements enter into its composition: "it is pastoral by association,
  chivalrous by temper, ethical by tendency, and allegorical by treatment"
  (Renton). Its subject was taken from the old cycle of Arthurian legends,
  which were brightened with the terrorless magic of Ariosto and Tasso. The
  scene of the adventures is laid in the enchanted forests and castles of
  the far away and unreal fairyland of mediæval chivalry, and the incidents
  themselves are either highly improbable or frankly impossible. The
  language is frequently archaic and designedly unfamiliar. Much of the
  machinery and properties used in carrying on the story, such as speaking
  myrtles, magic mirrors, swords, rings, impenetrable armor, and healing
  fountains, is supernatural. All the characters&mdash;the knights, ladies,
  dwarfs, magicians, dragons, nymphs, satyrs, and giants&mdash;are the
  conventional figures of pastoral romance.</p>

  <p>The framework of the plot of the <i>Faerie Queene</i> is vast and
  loosely put together. There are six main stories, or legends, and each
  contains several digressions and involved episodes. The plan of the
  entire work, which the author only half completed, is outlined in his
  letter to Sir Walter Raleigh. This letter serves as an admirable
  introduction to the poem, and should be read attentively by the student.
  Gloriana, the Queen of Fairyland, holds at her court a solemn feudal
  festival, lasting twelve days, during which she sends forth twelve of her
  greatest knights on as many separate adventures. The knights are
  commissioned to champion the cause of persons in distress and redress
  their wrongs. The ideal knight, Prince Arthur, is the central male figure
  of the poem. He is enamoured of Gloriana, having seen her in a wondrous
  vision, and is represented as journeying in quest of her. He appears in
  all of the legends at opportune moments to succor the knights when they
  are hard beset or in the power of their enemies. The six extant books
  contain respectively the legends of (I) the Knight of the Redcrosse, or
  Holiness, (II) Sir Guyon, the Knight of Temperance, (III) Britomart, the
  female Knight of Chastity, (IV) Sir Campbell and Sir Triamond, the
  Knights of Friendship, (V) Sir Artegall, the Knight of Justice, and (VI)
  Sir Caledore, the Knight of Courtesy. Book I is an allegory of man's
  relation to God, Book II, of man's relation to himself, Books III, IV, V,
  and VI, of man's relation to his fellow-man. Prince Arthur, the
  personification of Magnificence, by which Spenser means Magnanimity
  (Aristotle's
  <i>&mu;&epsilon;&gamma;&alpha;&lambda;&omicron;&psi;&upsilon;&chi;&#943;&alpha;</i>),
  is the ideal of a perfect character, in which all the private virtues are
  united. It is a poem of culture, inculcating the moral ideals of
  Aristotle and the teachings of Christianity.</p>

<a name="Intro_III.2"></a>
<p>2. INFLUENCE OF THE NEW LEARNING.&mdash;Like Milton, Gray, and other
  English poets, Spenser was a scholar familiar with the best in ancient
  and modern literature. As to Spenser's specific indebtedness, though he
  owed much in incident and diction to Chaucer's version of the <i>Romance
  of the Rose</i> and to Malory's <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>, the great epic
  poets, Tasso and Ariosto, should be given first place. The resemblance of
  passages in the <i>Faerie Queene</i> to others in the <i>Orlando
  Furioso</i> and the <i>Jerusalem Delivered</i> is so striking that some
  have accused the English poet of paraphrasing and slavishly borrowing
  from the two Italians. Many of these parallels are pointed out in the
  notes. To this criticism, Mr. Saintsbury remarks: "Not, perhaps, till the
  <i>Orlando</i> has been carefully read, and read in the original, is
  Spenser's real greatness understood. He has often, and evidently of
  purpose, challenged comparison; but in every instance it will be found
  that his beauties are emphatically his own. He has followed Ariosto only
  as Vergil has followed Homer, and much less slavishly."</p>

  <p>The influence of the New Learning is clearly evident in Spenser's use
  of <i>classical mythology</i>. Greek myths are placed side by side with
  Christian imagery and legends. Like Dante, the poet did not consider the
  Hellenic doctrine of sensuous beauty to be antagonistic to the truths of
  religion. There is sometimes an incongruous confusion of classicism and
  mediævalism, as when a magician is seen in the house of Morpheus, and a
  sorcerer goes to the realm of Pluto. Spenser was guided by a higher and
  truer sense of beauty than the classical purists know.</p>

  <p>A very attractive element of his classicism is his <i>worship of
  beauty</i>. The Greek conception of beauty included two forms&mdash;the
  sensuous and the spiritual. So richly colored and voluptuous are his
  descriptions that he has been called the painters' poet, "the Rubens,"
  and "the Raphael of the poets." As with Plato, Spenser's idea of the
  spiritually beautiful includes the true and the good. Sensuous beauty is
  seen in the forms of external nature, like the morning mist and sunshine,
  the rose gardens, the green elders, and the quiet streams. His ideal of
  perfect sensuous and spiritual beauty combined is found in womanhood.
  Such a one is Una, the dream of the poet's young manhood, and we
  recognize in her one whose soul is as fair as her face&mdash;an idealized
  type of a woman in real life who calls forth all our love and
  reverence.</p>

<a name="Intro_III.3"></a>
  <p>3. INTERPRETATION OF THE ALLEGORY.&mdash;In the sixteenth century it
  was the opinion of Puritan England that every literary masterpiece should
  not only give entertainment, but should also teach some moral or
  spiritual lesson. "No one," says Mr. Patee, "after reading Spenser's
  letter to Raleigh, can wander far into Spenser's poem without the
  conviction that the author's central purpose was didactic, almost as much
  as was Bunyan's in <i>Pilgrim's Progress.</i>" Milton doubtless had this
  feature of the <i>Faerie Queene</i> in mind when he wrote in <i>Il
  Penseroso</i>:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"And if aught else great bards beside</p>
      <p>In sage and solemn tunes have sung</p>
      <p>Of turneys, and of trophies hung,</p>
      <p>Of forests and enchantments drear,</p>
      <p><i>Where more is meant than meets the ear</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>That the allegory of the poem is closely connected with its aim and
  ethical tendency is evident from the statement of the author that "the
  generall end therefore of all the booke is to fashion a gentleman or
  noble person in vertuous and gentle discipline. Which for that I
  conceived should be most plausible and pleasing, being coloured with an
  historical fiction, the which the most part of men delight to read,
  rather for varietie of matter then for profite of the ensample." The
  <i>Faerie Queene</i> is, therefore, according to the avowed purpose of
  its author, a poem of culture. Though it is one of the most highly
  artistic works in the language, it is at the same time one of the most
  didactic. "It professes," says Mr. Church, "to be a veiled exposition of
  moral philosophy."</p>

  <p>The allegory is threefold,&mdash;moral, religious, and personal.</p>

  <p>(<i>a</i>) <i>Moral Allegory.</i>&mdash;The characters all represent
  various virtues and vices, whose intrigues and warfare against each other
  symbolize the struggle of the human soul after perfection. The Redcross
  Knight, for example, personifies the single private virtue of holiness,
  while Prince Arthur stands for that perfect manhood which combines all
  the moral qualities; Una represents abstract truth, while Gloriana
  symbolizes the union of all the virtues in perfect womanhood.</p>

  <p>(<i>b</i>) <i>Religious or Spiritual Allegory.</i>&mdash;Under this
  interpretation the Redcross Knight is a personification of Protestant
  England, or the church militant, while Una represents the true religion
  of the Reformed Church. On the other hand, Archimago symbolizes the
  deceptions of the Jesuits and Duessa the false Church of Rome
  masquerading as true religion.</p>

  <p>(<i>c</i>) <i>Personal and Political Allegory.</i>&mdash;Here we find
  a concrete presentation of many of Spenser's chief contemporaries. One of
  Spenser's prime objects in composing his epic was to please certain
  powerful persons at court, and above all to win praise and patronage from
  the vain and flattery loving queen, whom he celebrates as Gloriana.
  Prince Arthur is a character that similarly pays homage to Lord
  Leicester. In the Redcross Knight he compliments, no doubt, some
  gentleman like Sir Philip Sidney or Sir Walter Raleigh, as if he were a
  second St. George, the patron saint of England, while in Una we may see
  idealized some fair lady of the court. In Archimago he satirizes the
  odious King Philip II of Spain, and in false Duessa the fascinating
  intriguer, Mary Queen of Scots, who was undeserving so hard a blow.</p>

<a name="Intro_III.4"></a>
  <p>4. THE SPENSERIAN STANZA.&mdash;The <i>Faerie Queene</i> is written in
  the Spenserian Stanza, a form which the poet himself invented as a
  suitable vehicle for a long narrative poem. Suggestions for its
  construction were taken from three Italian metres&mdash;the Ottava Rima,
  the Terza Rima, the Sonnet&mdash;and the Ballade stanza. There are eight
  lines in the iambic pentameter measure (five accents);
  <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>

<pre>
            v -/- |  v   -/-   |  v   -/-  |  v -/- |  v   -/-
            a gen | tle knight | was prick | ing on | the plaine
</pre>
  <p>followed by one iambic hexameter, or Alexandrine (six accents);
  e.g.&mdash;</p>

<pre>
            v  -/- |  v   -/-   |  v   -/-  |  v   -/-   | v  -/-  | v   -/-
            as one | for knight | ly giusts | and fierce | encount | ers fitt
</pre>
  <p>The rhymes are arranged in the following order: <i>ab ab bc bcc</i>.
  It will be observed that the two quatrains are bound together by the
  first two <i>b</i> rhymes, and the Alexandrine, which rhymes with the
  eighth line, draws out the harmony with a peculiar lingering effect. In
  scanning and reading it is necessary to observe the laws of accentuation
  and pronunciation prevailing in Spenser's day; <i>e.g.</i> in
  <i>learned</i> (I, <a href="#Int.i">i</a>), <i>undeserved</i> (I, <a
  href="#Int.ii">ii</a>), and <i>woundes</i> (V, <a
  href="#v.xvii">xvii</a>) the final syllable is sounded, <i>patience</i>
  (X, <a href="#x.xxix">xxix</a>) is trisyllabic, <i>devotion</i> (X,
  <a href="#x.xlvi">xlvi</a>) is four syllables, and <i>entertainment</i>
  (X, <a href="#x.xxxvii">xxxvii</a>) is accented on the second and
  fourth syllables. Frequently there is in the line a cæsural pause, which
  may occur anywhere; <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"And quite dismembred hath; | the thirsty land</p>
      <p>Dronke up his life; | his corse left on the strand." (III, <a href="#iii.xx">xx</a>.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The rhythm of the meter is also varied by the alternating of
  end-stopped and run-on lines, as in the last quotation. An end-stopped
  line has a pause at the end, usually indicated by some mark of
  punctuation. A run-on line should be read closely with the following line
  with only a slight pause to indicate the line-unit. Monotony is prevented
  by the occasional use of a light or feminine ending&mdash;a syllable on
  which the voice does not or cannot rest; <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"Then choosing out few words most horrible." (I, <a href="#i.xxxvii">xxxvii</a>.)</p>
      <p>"That for his love refused deity." (III, <a href="#iii.xxi">xxi</a>.)</p>
      <p>"His ship far come from watrie wilderness." (III, <a href="#iii.xxxii">xxxii</a>.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The use of alliteration, <i>i.e.</i> having several words in a line
  beginning with the same letter, is another device frequently employed by
  Spenser for musical effect; <i>e.g.</i>&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>"In which that wicked wight his dayes doth weare." (I, <a href="#i.xxxi">xxxi</a>.)</p>
      <p>"Sweet slombring deaw, the which to sleep them biddes." (I, <a href="#i.xxxvi">xxxvi</a>.)</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<a name="Intro_III.5"></a>
  <p>5. VERSIFICATION.&mdash;In the handling of his stanza, Spenser
  revealed a harmony, sweetness, and color never before dreamed of in the
  English. Its compass, which admitted of an almost endless variety of
  cadence, harmonized well with the necessity for continuous narration. It
  appeals to the eye as well as to the ear, with its now languid, now
  vigorous, but always graceful turn of phrase. Its movement has been
  compared to the smooth, steady, irresistible sweep of water in a mighty
  river. Like Lyly, Marlowe, and Shakespeare, Spenser felt the new delight
  in the pictorial and musical qualities of words, and invented new
  melodies and word pictures. He aimed rather at finish, exactness, and
  fastidious neatness than at ease, freedom, and irregularity; and if his
  versification has any fault, it is that of monotony. The atmosphere is
  always perfectly adapted to the theme.</p>

<a name="Intro_III.6"></a>
  <p>6. DICTION AND STYLE.&mdash;The peculiar diction of the <i>Faerie
  Queene</i> should receive the careful attention of the student. As a
  romantic poet, Spenser often preferred archaic and semi-obsolete language
  to more modern forms. He uses four classes of words that were recognized
  as the proper and conventional language of pastoral and romantic poetry;
  viz. (a) <i>archaisms</i>, (b) <i>dialect</i>, (c) <i>classicisms</i>,
  and (d) <i>gallicisms</i>. He did not hesitate to adopt from Chaucer many
  obsolete words and grammatical forms. Examples are: the double negative
  with <i>ne</i>; <i>eyen</i>, <i>lenger</i>, <i>doen</i>, <i>ycladd</i>,
  <i>harrowd</i>, <i>purchas</i>, <i>raught</i>, <i>seely</i>,
  <i>stowre</i>, <i>swinge</i>, <i>owch</i>, and <i>withouten</i>. He also
  employs many old words from Layamon, Wiclif, and Langland, like
  <i>swelt</i>, <i>younglings</i>, <i>noye</i>, <i>kest</i>, <i>hurtle</i>,
  and <i>loft</i>. His dialectic forms are taken from the vernacular of the
  North Lancashire folk with which he was familiar. Some are still a part
  of the spoken language of that region, such as, <i>brent</i>,
  <i>cruddled</i>, <i>forswat</i>, <i>fearen</i>, <i>forray</i>,
  <i>pight</i>, <i>sithen</i>, <i>carle</i>, and <i>carke</i>.</p>

  <p>Examples of his use of classical constructions are: the ablative
  absolute, as, <i>which doen</i> (IV, <a href="#iv.xliii">xliii</a>);
  the relative construction with <i>when</i>, as, <i>which when</i> (I, <a
  href="#i.xvii">xvii</a>), <i>that when</i> (VII, <a href="#vii.xi">xi</a>);
  the comparative of the adjective in the sense of "too," as,
  <i>weaker</i> (I, <a href="#i.xlv">xlv</a>), harder (II, <a
  href="#ii.xxxvi">xxxvi</a>); the participial construction after
  <i>till</i>, as, <i>till further tryall made</i> (I, <a
  href="#i.xii">xii</a>); the superlative of location, as, <i>middest</i>
  (IV, <a href="#iv.xv">xv</a>); and the old gerundive, as, <i>wandering
  wood</i> (I, <a href="#i.xiii">xiii</a>). Most of the gallicisms found
  are anglicized loan words from the French <i>romans d'aventure</i>, such
  as, <i>disseized</i>, <i>cheare</i>, <i>chappell</i>, <i>assoiled</i>,
  <i>guerdon</i>, <i>palfrey</i>, <i>recreaunt</i>, <i>trenchand</i>,
  <i>syre</i>, and <i>trusse</i>. Notwithstanding Spenser's use of foreign
  words and constructions, his language is as thoroughly English in its
  idiom as that of any of our great poets.</p>

  <p>"I think that if he had not been a great poet," says Leigh Hunt, "he
  would have been a great painter."</p>

  <p>"After reading," says Pope, "a canto of Spenser two or three days ago
  to an old lady, between seventy and eighty years of age, she said that I
  had been showing her a gallery of pictures. I do not know how it is, but
  she said very right. There is something in Spenser that pleases one as
  strongly in old age as it did in youth. I read the <i>Faerie Queene</i>
  when I was about twelve, with infinite delight; and I think it gave me as
  much, when I read it over about a year or two ago."</p>

  <p>The imperishable charm of the poem lies in its appeal to the pure
  sense of beauty. "A beautiful pagan dream," says Taine, "carries on a
  beautiful dream of chivalry." The reader hears in its lines a stately and
  undulating rhythm that intoxicates the ear and carries him on with an
  irresistible fascination, he sees the unsubstantial forms of fairyland go
  sweeping by in a gorgeous and dreamlike pageantry, and he feels pulsing
  in its luxuriant and enchanted atmosphere the warm and beauty-loving
  temper of the Italian Renaissance. "Spenser is superior to his subject,"
  says Taine, "comprehends it fully, frames it with a view to the end, in
  order to impress upon it the proper mark of his soul and his genius. Each
  story is modified with respect to another, and all with respect to a
  certain effect which is being worked out. Thus a beauty issues from this
  harmony,&mdash;the beauty in the poet's heart,&mdash;which his whole work
  strives to express; a noble and yet a laughing beauty, made up of moral
  elevation and sensuous seductions, English in sentiment, Italian in
  externals, chivalric in subject, modern in its perfection, representing a
  unique and admirable epoch, the appearance of paganism in a Christian
  race, and the worship of form by an imagination of the North."</p>

<h2>LETTER TO SIR WALTER RALEIGH</h2>

  <p>A LETTER of the Authors expounding his whole intention in the course
  of this worke;<a name="NtA_1"></a><a href="#Nt_1"><sup>1</sup></a> which,
  for that it giveth great light to the reader, for the better
  understanding is hereunto annexed.</p>

<h3>TO THE RIGHT NOBLE AND VALOROUS</h3>

<h2>SIR WALTER RALEIGH, KNIGHT.</h2>

  <p class="c"><i>Lo: Wardein of the Stanneries, and her majesties lieutenaunt of the
  countie of Cornewayll.</i></p>

  <p>SIR,</p>

  <p>Knowing how doubtfully all Allegories may be constructed, and this
  booke of mine, which I have entituled <i>The Faery Queene</i>, being a
  continued Allegorie, or darke conceit, I have thought good, as well for
  avoyding of jealous opinions and misconstructions, as also for your
  better light in reading thereof, (being so, by you commanded) to discover
  unto you the generall intention and meaning, which in the whole course
  thereof I have fashioned, without expressing of any particular purposes,
  or by-accidents therein occasioned. The generall end therefore of all the
  booke, is to fashion a gentleman or noble person in vertuous and gentle
  discipline. Which for that I conceived shoulde be most plausible and
  pleasing, beeing coloured with an historicall fiction, the which the most
  part of men delight to read, rather for varietie of matter than for
  profit of the ensample: I chose the historie of king Arthure, as most fit
  for the excellencie of his person, beeing made famous by many mens former
  workes, and also furthest from the danger of envie, and suspicion of
  present time. In which I have followed all the antique poets historicall:
  first Homer, who in the persons of Agamemnon and Ulysses hath ensampled a
  good governour and a vertuous man, the one in his <i>Ilias</i>, the other
  in his <i>Odysseis</i>: then Virgil, whose like intention was to doe in
  the person of <i>Æneas</i>: after him Ariosto comprised them both in his
  <i>Orlando</i>: and lately Tasso dissevered them againe, and formed both
  parts in two persons, namely, that part which they in philosophy call
  <i>Ethice</i>, or vertues of a private man, coloured in his
  <i>Rinaldo</i>: the other named <i>Politice</i>, in his <i>Godfredo</i>.
  By ensample of which excellent Poets, I laboure to pourtraict in Arthure,
  before he was king, the image of a brave knight, perfected in the twelve
  private morall vertues, as Aristotle hath devised: which if I find to be
  well accepted, I may be perhaps encoraged to frame the other part of
  pollitike vertues in his person, after he came to bee king.</p>

  <p>To some I know this Methode will seem displeasant, which had rather
  have good discipline delivered plainly in way of precepts, or sermoned at
  large, as they use, then thus clowdily enwrapped in Allegoricall devises.
  But such, mee seeme, should be satisfied with the use of these dayes,
  seeing all things accounted by their showes, and nothing esteemed of,
  that is not delightfull and pleasing to common sense. For this cause is
  Xenophon preferred before Plato, for that the one, in the exquisite depth
  of his judgement, formed a Commune-wealth, such as it should be; but the
  other, in the person of Cyrus and the Persians, fashioned a government,
  such as might best be: So much more profitable and gracious is doctrine
  by ensample then by rule. So have I laboured to do in the person of
  Arthure: whom I conceive, after his long education by Timon (to whom he
  was by Merlin delivered to be brought up, so soone as he was borne of the
  Lady Igrayne) to have seen in a dreame or vision the Faerie Queene, with
  whose excellent beautie ravished, hee awaking, resolved to seek her out:
  and so, being by Merlin armed, and by Timon throughly instructed, he went
  to seeke her forth in Faery land. In that Faery Queene I mean
  <i>Glory</i> in my generall intention: but in my particular I conceive
  the most excellent and glorious person of our soveraine the Queene, and
  her kingdome in Faery land. And yet, in some places else, I doe otherwise
  shadow her. For considering shee beareth two persons, the one of a most
  royall Queene or Empresse, the other of a most vertuous and beautifull
  lady, this latter part in some places I doe expresse in Belphoebe,
  fashioning her name according to your owne excellent conceipt of
  Cynthia,<a name="NtA_2"></a><a href="#Nt_2"><sup>2</sup></a> (Phoebe and
  Cynthia being both names of Diana). So in the person of Prince Arthure I
  sette forth magnificence in particular, which vertue, for that (according
  to Aristotle and the rest) it is the perfection of all the rest, and
  containeth in it them all, therefore in the whole course I mention the
  deeds of Arthure appliable to the vertue, which I write of in that booke.
  But of the twelve other vertues I make XII other knights the patrons, for
  the more varietie of the historic: Of which these three bookes containe
  three. The first, of the Knight of the Red crosse, in whom I expresse
  Holinesse: the second of Sir Guyon, in whome I set foorth Temperance: the
  third of Britomartis, a Lady knight, in whom I picture Chastitie. But
  because the beginning of the whole worke seemeth abrupt and as depending
  upon other antecedents, it needs that yee know the occasion of these
  three knights severall adventures. For the Methode of a Poet historicall
  is not such as of an Historiographer. For an Historiographer discourseth
  of affaires orderly as they were done, accounting as well the times as
  the actions; but a Poet thrusteth into the middest, even where it most
  concerneth him, and there recoursing to the things forepast, and divining
  of things to come, maketh a pleasing analysis of all. The beginning
  therefore of my historie, if it were to be told by an Historiographer,
  should be the twelfth booke, which is the last; where I devise that the
  Faery Queene kept her annuall feast twelve daies; uppon which twelve
  severall dayes, the occasions of the twelve severall adventures hapned,
  which being undertaken by XII severall knights, are in these twelve books
  severally handled and discoursed.</p>

  <p>The first was this. In the beginning of the feast, there presented him
  selfe a tall clownish younge man, who falling before the Queene of
  Faeries desired a boone (as the manner then was) which during that feast
  she might not refuse: which was that hee might have the atchievement of
  any adventure, which during that feast should happen; that being granted,
  he rested him selfe on the fioore, unfit through his rusticitie for a
  better place. Soone after entred a faire Ladie in mourning weedes, riding
  on a white Asse, with a dwarfe behind her leading a warlike steed, that
  bore the Armes of a knight, and his speare in the dwarfes hand. She
  falling before the Queene of Faeries, complayned that her father and
  mother, an ancient King and Queene, had bene by an huge dragon many yeers
  shut up in a brazen Castle, who thence suffered them not to issew: and
  therefore besought the Faery Queene to assigne her some one of her
  knights to take on him that exployt. Presently that clownish person
  upstarting, desired that adventure; whereat the Queene much wondering,
  and the Lady much gaine-saying, yet he earnestly importuned his desire.
  In the end the Lady told him, that unlesse that armour which she brought
  would serve him (that is, the armour of a Christian man specified by
  Saint Paul, V. Ephes.) that he could not succeed in that enterprise:
  which being forth with put upon him with due furnitures thereunto, he
  seemed the goodliest man in al that company, and was well liked of the
  Lady. And eftesoones taking on him knighthood, and mounting on that
  straunge Courser, he went forth with her on that adventure: where
  beginneth the first booke, viz.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>A gentle knight was pricking on the playne, etc.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The second day there came in a Palmer bearing an Infant with bloody
  hands, whose Parents he complained to have bene slaine by an
  enchauntresse called Acrasia: and therefore craved of the Faery Queene,
  to appoint him some knight to performe that adventure, which being
  assigned to Sir Guyon, he presently went foorth with the same Palmer:
  which is the beginning of the second booke and the whole subject thereof.
  The third day there came in a Groome, who complained before the Faery
  Queene, that a vile Enchaunter, called Busirane, had in hand a most faire
  Lady, called Amoretta, whom he kept in most grevious torment. Whereupon
  Sir Scudamour, the lover of that Lady, presently tooke on him that
  adventure. But beeing unable to performe it by reason of the hard
  Enchauntments, after long sorrow, in the end met with Britomartis, who
  succoured him, and reskewed his love.</p>

  <p>But by occasion hereof, many other adventures are intermedled; but
  rather as accidents then intendments. As the love of Britomart, the
  overthrow of Marinell, the miserie of Florimell, the vertuousness of
  Belphoebe; and many the like.</p>

  <p>Thus much, Sir, I have briefly-over-run to direct your understanding
  to the wel-head of the History, that from thence gathering the whole
  intention of the conceit, ye may as in a handfull gripe all the
  discourse, which otherwise may happely seem tedious and confused. So
  humbly craving the continuance of your honourable favour towards me, and
  th' eternall establishment of your happines, I humbly take leave.</p>

  <p>Yours most humbly affectionate,</p>

  <p>EDM. SPENSER.</p>

  <p>23 Januarie, 1589.</p>

  <p>I. <i>The Plot:</i> At the bidding of Gloriana, the Redcross Knight
  undertakes to deliver Una's parents from a dragon who holds them captive.
  He sets out upon his quest attended by a dwarf and guided by Una, mounted
  on an ass and leading a lamb. They are driven by a storm into a forest,
  where they discover the cave of Error, who is slain by the Knight. They
  are then beguiled into the house of Archimago, an old enchanter. By his
  magic he leads the Knight in a dream to believe that Una is false to him,
  and thus separates them.</p>

  <p>II. <i>The Allegory:</i> 1. Holiness, the love of God, united with
  Truth, the knowledge of God, is to deliver man from the thraldom of the
  Devil. Together they are able to overthrow Error; but Hypocrisy
  deceitfully alienates Holiness from Truth by making the latter appear
  unworthy of love.</p>

  <p>2. There is a hint of the intrigues of the false Roman church and the
  treacherous Spanish king, Philip II, to undermine the religious and
  political freedom of the English people. The English nation, following
  the Reformed church, overthrows the Catholic faith, but is deceived by
  the machinations of Spanish diplomacy.</p>

  shield bore "a cross gules upon a field argent," a red cross on a silver
  ground. See <i>The Birth of St. George</i> in Percy's <i>Reliques</i>,

  <i>Assembly of Foules</i>, 176, and Tasso's <i>Jerusalem Delivered</i>,

  brownies, who both dwelt under ground, and the fair elves, who dwelt in

<h3><a href="#canto_II">CANTO II</a></h3>

  <p>I. <i>The Plot</i>: Deceived by Archimago's phantoms, the Redcross
  Knight suspects the chastity of Una, and flies at early dawn with his
  dwarf. He chances to meet the Saracen Sansfoy in company with the false
  Duessa. They do battle and Sansfoy is slain. Duessa under the name of
  Fidessa attaches herself to the Knight, and they ride forward. They stop
  to rest under some shady trees, On breaking a bough, the Knight discovers
  that the trees are two lovers, Fradubio and Fraelissa, thus imprisoned by
  the cruel enchantment of Duessa.</p>

  <p>II. <i>The Allegory</i>: 1. Hypocrisy under a pious disguise is
  attractive to Holiness. Truth is also deceived by it, and shamefully
  slandered. Holiness having abandoned Truth, takes up with Falsehood, who
  is attended by Infidelity. Unbelief when openly assailing Holiness is
  overthrown, but Falsehood under the guise of Faith remains undiscovered.
  The fate of the man (Fradubio) is set forth who halts between two
  opinions,&mdash;False Religion (Duessa) and Heathen Philosophy, or
  Natural Religion (Fraelissa).</p>

  <p>2. The Reformed Church, no longer under the guidance of Truth, rushes
  headlong into Infidelity, and unwittingly became the defender of the
  Romish Faith under the name of the True Faith. There is a hint of the
  intrigues of Mary Queen of Scots and the libels of the Jesuits on Queen
  Elizabeth designed to bring back the English nation to Romish
  allegiance.</p>

  <p>I. <i>The Plot:</i> Una wandering in quest of her Knight is guarded by
  a Lion. With difficulty they gain entrance to the cottage of Corceca and
  her daughter Abessa, the paramour of Kirkrapine. The latter is killed by
  the Lion. Fleeing the next day, Una falls in with Archimago disguised as
  the Redcross Knight. They journey on and meet a second Saracen knight,
  Sansloy. In the fight which ensues Archimago is unhorsed and his
  deception unmasked. The Lion is slain, and Una becomes the captive of
  Sansloy.</p>

  <p>II. <i>The Allegory:</i> 1. Truth finds temporary protection in
  Reason, or Natural Honor (Lion), and with its help puts a stop to the
  Robbing of Churches (Kirkrapine), which is connived at by Blind Devotion
  (Corceca) and Secret Sin (Abessa). Truth is then associated with
  Hypocrisy under the guise of Holiness, but it is soon unmasked by
  Lawlessness (Sansloy), with which Truth is forced into an unnatural
  alliance.</p>

  <p>2. "The lion is said to represent Henry VIII, overthrowing the
  monasteries, destroying church-robbers, disturbing the dark haunts of
  idleness, ignorance and superstition."&mdash;Kitchin. The battle between
  Archimago and Sansloy refers to the contests of the Catholic powers with
  the Moslems. The whole canto also has a hint of the violence and
  lawlessness connected with the English conquest of Ireland.</p>

<h3><a href="#canto_IV">CANTO IV</a></h3>

  <p>I. <i>The Plot:</i> In this and the following canto the adventures of
  the Redcross Knight are continued from <a href="#canto_II">Canto II</a>. Guided by Duessa, he
  enters the House of Pride. There he sees Lucifera, the Queen of Pride,
  attended by her sinful court. Her six Counselors are described in detail,
  with an account of a pleasure trip taken by the Queen and her court.
  Sansjoy unexpectedly arrives and challenges the Knight to mortal combat
  for the shield of Sansfoy. That night Duessa holds a secret conference
  with the Saracen knight.</p>

  <p>II. <i>The Allegory:</i> 1. The Christian Soldier, under the influence
  of false ideals (Duessa), is exposed to the temptations of the Seven
  Deadly Sins, chief among which is Pride. In the midst of these sinful
  pleasures, he is assailed by Joylessness, on whose side is Falsehood
  secretly.</p>

  <p>2. The religious and political allegory is here vague and somewhat
  discontinuous. There is a hint, however, of the attempts of Mary Queen of
  Scots to bring England back to Romanism. The pride and corruption of the
  false church and its clergy are set forth. There is also a suggestion of
  the perilous position of the English in Ireland.</p>

<h3><a href="#canto_V">CANTO V</a></h3>

  <p>I. <i>The Plot</i>: (a continuation of <a href="#canto_IV">Canto IV</a>). The Knight fights in
  the lists with Sansjoy and defeats him, but is prevented by Duessa's
  magic from slaying him. Duessa descends to Erebus and obtains the aid of
  Night, who conveys the wounded Saracen in her chariot to Æsculapius to be
  healed of his wounds. The tortures of some of the souls in Erebus are
  described, particularly the cause of Æsculapius' punishment. A roll of
  the prisoners whom the dwarf discovers in Pride's dungeon is given. The
  Knight flees with the dwarf from her house.</p>

  <p>II. <i>The Allegory</i>: When the Christian Soldier is attacked by
  Joylessness, he has a far more desperate struggle than that with
  Infidelity, and comes out wounded though victorious. Joylessness when
  crushed by Holiness is restored by Pagan Philosophy. The backsliding
  Christian is warned in time by Prudence of the fearful consequences of
  sin, and hastens to turn his back on Pride and the other sins. The soul
  is led to dread Pride, not by Truth, but by its sufferings and other
  inferior motives.</p>

<h3><a href="#canto_VI">CANTO VI</a></h3>

  <p>I. <i>The Plot</i>: (Continuation of <a href="#canto_III">Canto III</a>). Una is delivered from
  Sansloy by a band of Satyrs. She remains with them as their teacher.
  There a knight of the wild-wood, Sir Satyrane, discovers her, and by his
  assistance, Una succeeds in making her way out of the forest to the
  plain. On the way they meet Archimago, disguised as a pilgrim, and he
  deceives them and leads them to Sansloy. While Sir Satyrane and Sansloy
  are engaged in a bloody battle, Una flees. She is pursued by Archimago
  but makes her escape.</p>

  <p>II. <i>The Allegory</i>: 1. Truth is saved from destruction by Lawless
  Violence (Sansloy) by the aid of Barbarism or Savage Instinct, which
  terrorizes Lawlessness but offers natural homage to Truth. Truth finds a
  temporary home among Ignorant and Rude Folk (Satyrs) and in return
  imparts divine truth to their unregenerate minds. Natural Heroism or
  Manly Courage (Sir Satyrane) sides with Truth and defends it against
  Lawlessness.</p>

  <p>2. The religious allegory signifies the extension of Protestantism
  through the outlying rural districts of England and in Ireland. Upton
  thinks that Sir Satyrane represents "Sir John Perrot, whose behaviour,
  though honest, was too coarse and rude for a court. 'Twas well known that
  he was a son of Henry VIII." Holinshed says that as Lord President of
  Munster, Sir John secured such peace and security that a man might travel
  in Ireland with a white stick only in his hand.</p>

<h3><a href="#canto_VII">CANTO VII</a></h3>

  <p>I. <i>The Plot:</i> (Continuation of <a href="#canto_V">Canto V</a>). Duessa pursues the
  Redcross Knight, and overtakes him sitting by an enchanted fountain,
  weary and disarmed. He is beguiled into drinking from the fountain, and
  is quickly deprived of strength. In this unnerved and unarmed condition
  he is suddenly set upon by the giant Orgoglio. After a hopeless struggle
  he is struck down by the giant's club and is thrust into a dungeon. Una
  is informed by the dwarf of the Knight's misfortune and is prostrated
  with grief. Meeting Prince Arthur, she is persuaded to tell her story and
  receives promise of his assistance.</p>

  <p>II. <i>The Allegory:</i> 1. The Christian soldier, beguiled by
  Falsehood, doffs the armor of God, and indulges in sinful pleasures, and
  loses his purity. He then quickly falls into the power of Carnal Pride,
  or the brutal tyranny of False Religion (Orgoglio). He can then be
  restored only by an appeal to the Highest Honor or Magnificence (Prince
  Arthur) through the good offices of Truth and Common Sense.</p>

  <p>2. In the reaction from the Reformation, Protestant England by
  dallying with Romanism (Duessa, Mary Queen of Scots) falls under the
  tyrannic power of the Pope (Orgoglio), with whom Catholic England was
  coquetting. At this juncture National Honor and Consciousness comes to
  the relief of Protestantism. There is personal compliment to either Lord
  Leicester or Sir Philip Sidney.</p>

  Philip Sidney. Could the author have possibly intended in him compliment
  to Sir Walter Raleigh? See Spenser's <i>Letter to Raleigh</i>. Arthur is
  the beau ideal of knighthood, and upon him the poet lavishes his richest
  descriptive powers. His armor, his shield Pridwen, his lance Roan, and
  sword Exculibur, were made by the great enchanter Merlin in the isle of
  Avallon.</p>

<h3>QUESTIONS AND TOPICS</h3>

<p class="center">(<a href="#canto_VII">Canto VII</a>)</p>

  <p>1. Relate how the Knight fell into the hands of the Giant. 2. Note the
  fine adaptation of sound to sense in vii. 3. Who were the parents and the
  foster-father of Orgoglio? 4. What are the principal characteristics of
  the giants of romance as seen in Orgoglio? cf. with the giants in
  <i>Pilgrim's Progress</i>. 5. In the description of the giant do the last
  two lines (<a href="#vii.viii">viii</a>) add to or detract from the
  impression? Why? 6. To whom does Spenser ascribe the invention of
  artillery? 7. Explain the allegory involved in the relations of Duessa
  and Orgoglio. 8. How does Una act on hearing the news of the Knight's
  capture? 9. What part does the Dwarf play? 10. Is Una just to herself in
  ll. <a href="#vii.200">200</a>-201? 11. Is she over sentimental or
  ineffective&mdash;and is the pathos of her grief kept within the limits
  of the reader's pleasure? 12. Express in your own words the main thought
  in <a href="#vii.xxii">xxii</a>. 13. Note the skillful summary of events
  in <a href="#vii.xxvi">xxvi</a>, and observe that this stanza is the
  <i>Central Crisis</i> and <i>Pivotal Point</i> of the whole Book. The
  fortunes of the Knight reach their lowest ebb and begin to turn. The
  first half of the Book has been the <i>complication</i> of the plot, the
  second half will be the <i>resolution</i>. 14. Give a description of
  Prince Arthur. 15. What mysterious power was possessed by his shield? Cf.
  the Holy Grail. 16. Observe carefully the scene between Una and Arthur,
  noting the changes in her mood. What light is thrown on her character?
  What are her feelings toward the Knight? 17. Explain the various threads
  of allegory in this Canto.</p>

<h3><a href="#canto_VIII">CANTO VIII</a></h3>

  <p>I. <i>The Plot:</i> Prince Arthur and Una are conducted by the Dwarf
  to Orgoglio's Castle. At the blast of the Squire's horn the Giant comes
  forth attended by Duessa mounted on the seven-headed Beast. In the battle
  which ensues Arthur wounds the Beast, slays the Giant and captures
  Duessa. Prince Arthur finds the Redcross Knight half starved in a foul
  dungeon and releases him. Duessa is stripped of her gaudy clothes and
  allowed to hide herself in the wilderness.</p>

  <p>II. <i>The Allegory:</i> 1. Magnificence, the sum of all the virtues,
  wins the victory over Carnal Pride, and restores Holiness to its better
  half, Truth. With the overthrow of Pride, Falsehood, which is the ally of
  that vice, is stripped of its outward show and exposed in all its hideous
  deformity.</p>

  <p>2. The false Romish Church becomes drunk in the blood of the martyrs.
  There is a hint of the persecutions in the Netherlands, in Piedmont, of
  the massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day and the burnings under Bloody Mary.
  Protestant England is delivered from Popish tyranny by the honor and
  courage of the English people. Militant England (Prince Arthur) is
  assisted by the clergy (Squire) with his horn (Bible) and is guided by
  Truth and Common Sense (Dwarf).</p>

  <b>Best musicke breeds delight,</b> etc. A troublesome passage. Upton and
  Jortin emend <i>delight</i> to <i>dislike</i>; Church inserts <i>no</i>
  before <i>delight</i> and omits <i>best</i>; Kitchin suggests
  <i>despight</i>; Grosart prefers the text as it stands with the meaning
  that although the best music pleases the troubled mind, it is no pleasure
  to renew the memory of past sufferings. I venture to offer still another
  solution, based on the context. When Una shows a desire to hear from her
  Knight a recountal of his sufferings in the dungeon, and he is silent,
  being loath to speak of them, Arthur reminds her that a <i>change of
  subject is best</i>, for the best music is that which breeds delight in
  the troubled ear.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_viii.xlvi"></a><a class="b" href="#viii.xlvi">xlvi.</a> In
  this passage Spenser follows closely the description of the witch Alcina
  in Ariosto's <i>Orlando Furioso</i>, vii, 73. Rogero has been fascinated
  by her false beauty, and her real foulness is exposed by means of a magic
  ring. The stripping of Duessa symbolizes the proscription of vestments
  and ritual, and the overthrow of images, etc., at the time of the
  Reformation. Duessa is only banished to the wilderness, not put to death,
  and reappears in another book of the poem.</p>

<h3><a href="#canto_IX">CANTO IX</a></h3>

  <p>I. <i>The Plot:</i> Prince Arthur tells Una of his vision of the
  Faerie Queene and of his quest for her. After exchanging presents with
  the Redcross Knight, he bids farewell to Una and her companions. These
  pursue their journey and soon meet a young knight, Sir Trevisan, fleeing
  from Despair. Sir Trevisan tells of his narrow escape from this old man,
  and unwillingly conducts the Redcross Knight back to his cave. The Knight
  enters and is almost persuaded to take his own life. He is saved by the
  timely interposition of Una. This is the most powerful canto of Book
  I.</p>

  <p>II. <i>The Allegory:</i> 1. The moral allegory in <a href="#canto_VII">Canto VII</a> presents
  the transition of the Soul (Redcross) from Pride to Sin (Duessa) through
  distrust of Truth (Una), and it thus comes into the bondage of Carnal
  Pride (Orgoglio). In Canto IX the Soul suffers a similar change from Sin
  to Despair. Having escaped from actual sin, but with spiritual life
  weakened, it almost falls a victim to Despair through excess of
  confidence and zeal to perform some good action. The Soul is saved by
  Truth, by which it is reminded to depend on the grace of God.</p>

  <p>2. The allegory on its religious side seems to have some obscure
  reference to the long and bitter controversies between Protestantism
  (Calvinism) and Roman Catholicism allied with infidelity.</p>

<h3>QUESTIONS AND TOPICS</h3>

<p class="center">(<a href="#canto_IX">Canto IX</a>)</p>

  <p>1. Give an account of Prince Arthur's vision of the Faerie Queene. 2.
  Interpret his search for her as an allegory of the young man's quest
  after his ideal. 3. Observe in xvii an allusion to Spenser's patron, Lord
  Leicester, who was a favored suitor for Elizabeth's hand. 4. What
  presents did the Knights exchange at parting? 5. Characterize Sir
  Trevisan by his appearance, speech, and actions. What does he symbolize?
  6. Note the skill with which Spenser arouses interest before telling of
  the interview with Despair. 7. What was the fate of Sir Terwin? Its moral
  significance? 8. Describe the Cave of Despair, and show what effects are
  aimed at by the poet. 9. Compare with Despair Bunyan's Giant Despair and
  the Man in the Iron Cage. 10. Trace the sophistries by which Despair
  works in the mind of the Knight, <i>e.g.</i> the arguments from necessity
  (fatalism), humanity, cowardice, discouragement and disgust on account of
  his past failures, dread of the future, of God's justice, and the relief
  of death. 11. Does Despair show knowledge of the Knight's past? 12. With
  what powerful truths does Una meet the arguments of Despair? 13. Where do
  you find reference to mediæval art?</p>

  <p>14. Find examples of <i>Euphuism</i>, <i>metaphors</i>,
  <i>similes</i>, <i>Latinisms</i>, and <i>alliteration</i>. 15. Explain

<h3><a href="#canto_X">CANTO X</a></h3>

  <p>I. <i>The Plot:</i> The Redcross Knight is conducted by Una to the
  House of Holiness, where they are welcomed by Dame C&#339;lia and
  graciously entertained. The Knight is instructed by Fidelia, Speranza,
  and Charissa, the three daughters of C&#339;lia, in his relations to God
  and his fellow-men. He is healed in body, and undergoes discipline for
  his sins. Mercy conducts him through the Hospital of Good Works, where he
  sees her seven Beadsmen. He then with Una climbs the Hill of
  Contemplation and hears from a holy man the story of his past with a
  prophecy of his future, and obtains a view of the City of Heaven.</p>

  <p>This must be pronounced the most beautiful canto of the first
  book.</p>

  <p>II. <i>The Allegory:</i> 1. The Soul is brought by the Truth to a
  knowledge of the Heavenly Life (C&#339;lia), and is led, through
  repentance, to seek forgiveness and to desire a holier life. Having
  learned Faith and Hope, it acquires a zeal for Good Works (Charity), and
  is strengthened by exercising Patience and Repentance. At last it enjoys
  a mood of happy Contemplation of the past with bright prospects for the
  future. The whole canto sets forth the beauty in a life of faith combined
  with good deeds.</p>

  <p>2. The religious allegory presents the doctrine, discipline, and
  spirit of Protestantism in the sixteenth century. A close parallel may be
  drawn between this canto and many things in Bunyan's <i>Pilgrim's
  Progress</i>. For his House of Holiness and its management, Spenser has
  no doubt taken many suggestions from the great manor house of some
  Elizabethan gentleman.</p>

  complimentary to Queen Elizabeth. 16. What prophecy was made of the
  Knight?</p>

<h3><a href="#canto_XI">CANTO XI</a></h3>

  <p>I. <i>The Plot</i>: The Redcross Knight reaches the Brazen Tower in
  which Una's parents, the King and Queen of Eden, are besieged by the
  Dragon. The monster is described. The first day's fight is described, in
  which the Knight is borne through the air in the Dragon's claws, wounds
  him under the wing with his lance, but is scorched by the flames from the
  monster's mouth. The Knight is healed by a bath in the Well of Life. On
  the second day the Knight gives the Dragon several sword-wounds, but is
  stung by the monster's tail and forced to retreat by the flames. That
  night he is refreshed and healed by the balm from the Tree of Life. On
  the third day he slays the Dragon by a thrust into his vitals.</p>

  <p>II. <i>The Allegory</i>: 1. Mankind has been deprived of Eden by Sin
  or Satan (Dragon). The Christian overcomes the devil by means of the
  whole armor of God (shield of faith, helmet of salvation, sword of the
  Spirit, etc.). The soul is strengthened by the ordinances of religion:
  baptism, regeneration, etc.</p>

  <p>2. There is a hint of the long and desperate struggle between Reformed
  England (St. George) and the Church of Rome, in which the power of the
  Pope and the King of Spain was broken in England, the Netherlands, and
  other parts of Europe. Some may see a remoter allusion to the delivery of
  Ireland from the same tyranny.</p>

<h3>QUESTIONS AND TOPICS</h3>

<p class="center">(<a href="#canto_XI">Canto XI</a>)</p>

  <p>1. Describe the three days' fight between the Knight and the Dragon.
  2. What advantages does each gain? 3. Study the Dragon as a type of the
  conventional monster of romance, contrasting his brutal nature with the
  intellectuality and strategy of the Knight. 4. Study the battle as an
  allegory of the victory of mind over matter, of virtue over vice, of
  Protestantism over Romanism. 5. By what devices does Spenser obtain the
  effects of <i>terror</i>? Mystery and terror are prime elements in
  romance. 6. Find examples of another romantic characteristic,
  <i>exaggeration</i>. 7. Do you think that in his use of hyperbole and
  impossibilities Spenser shows that he was deficient in a sense of humor?
  8. Observe the lyric note in iii and liv. 9. How does the poet impress
  the reader with the size of the Dragon? 10. Which Muse does he invoke?
  11. Spenser's poetry is richly <i>sensuous</i>: find passages in which he
  appeals to the sense of <i>sight</i> (<a href="#xi.iv">iv</a>, <a
  href="#xi.viii">viii</a>, <a href="#xi.xiv">xiv</a>), of <i>sound</i> (<a
  href="#xi.iv">iv</a>, <a href="#xi.ix">ix</a>), of <i>touch</i> (<a

  href="#xi.xxii">xxii</a>), of <i>motion</i> (<a href="#xi.x">x</a>, <a
  href="#xi.xv">xv</a>, <a href="#xi.xviii">xviii</a>). 12. Where do you
  find an allegory of baptism? Of regeneration? Of the resurrection of
  Christ (the three days)? 13. Analyze the descriptions of the coming of
  darkness and of dawn.</p>

<h3><a href="#canto_XII">CANTO XII</a></h3>

  <p>I. <i>The Plot</i>: The death of the dragon is announced by the
  watchman on the tower of the city, and Una's parents, the King and Queen,
  accompanied by a great throng, come forth rejoicing at their deliverance.
  The Knight and Una are conducted with great honors into the palace. On
  the eve of their betrothal, Archimago suddenly appears as Duessa's
  messenger and claims the Knight. Their wicked attempt is frustrated, and
  the pair are happily betrothed. After a long time spent in Una's society,
  the Knight sets out to engage in the further service of the Faerie
  Queene.</p>

  <p>II. <i>The Allegory</i>: Holiness, by conquering the devil, frees the
  whole human race from the tyranny of sin. It is embarrassed by the
  unexpected appearance of the consequences of its past sins, but makes a
  manly confession. In spite of hypocritical intrigues (Archimago) and
  false slanders (Duessa), Holiness is united to Truth, thus forming a
  perfect character. The champion of the church militant responds
  cheerfully to the calls of duty and honor.</p>

  <p>2. Reformed England, having destroyed the brutal power of Rome, is
  firmly united to the truth in spite of the intrigues of the Pope to win
  it back to allegiance. It then goes forth against the King of Spain in
  obedience to the command of Queen Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

redistribution.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
<a href="https://gutenberg.org/license">https://gutenberg.org/license)</a>.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
https://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">https://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
