<<STOP>>INTRODUCTION


<<STOP>>WHILST engaged on the Translations contained in these volumes, and on the
Notes appended to the various Tales, I have found myself led unavoidably
into a much more extensive course of reading than I had originally
contemplated, and one which in great measure bears directly upon the
earlier Mediæval Romance.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>Before commencing these labours, I was aware, generally, that there
existed a connexion between the Welsh Mabinogion and the Romance of the
Continent; but as I advanced, I became better acquainted with the
closeness and extent of that connexion, its history, and the proofs by
which it is supported.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>At the same time, indeed, I became aware, and still strongly feel, that
it is one thing to collect facts, and quite another to classify and draw
from them their legitimate conclusions; and though I am loth that what
has been collected with some pains, should be entirely thrown away, it is
unwillingly, and with diffidence, that I trespass beyond the acknowledged
province of a translator.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries there arose into general
notoriety in Europe, a body of “Romance,” which in various forms retained
its popularity till the Reformation.  <<STOP>>In it the plot, the incidents, the
characters, were almost wholly those of Chivalry, that bond which united
the warriors of France, Spain, and Italy, with those of pure Teutonic
descent, and embraced more or less firmly all the nations of Europe,
excepting only the Slavonic races, not yet risen to power, and the Celts,
who had fallen from it.  <<STOP>>It is not difficult to account for this latter
omission.  <<STOP>>The Celts, driven from the plains into the mountains and
islands, preserved their liberty, and hated their oppressors with fierce,
and not causeless, hatred.  <<STOP>>A proud and free people, isolated both in
country and language, were not likely to adopt customs which implied
brotherhood with their foes.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>Such being the case, it is remarkable that when the chief romances are
examined, the name of many of the heroes and their scenes of action are
found to be Celtic, and those of persons and places famous in the
traditions of Wales and Brittany.  <<STOP>>Of this the romances of Ywaine and
Gawaine, Sir Perceval de Galles, Eric and Enide, Mort d’Arthur, Sir
Lancelot, Sir Tristan, the Graal, &c., may be cited as examples.  <<STOP>>In some
cases a tendency to triads, and other matters of internal evidence, point
in the same direction.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>It may seem difficult to account for this.  <<STOP>>Although the ancient dominion
of the Celts over Europe is not without enduring evidence in the names of
the mountains and streams, the great features of a country, yet the loss
of their prior language by the great mass of the Celtic nations in
Southern Europe (if indeed their successors in territory be at all of
their blood), prevents us from clearly seeing, and makes us wonder, how
stories, originally embodied in the Celtic dialects of Great Britain and
France, could so influence the literature of nations to whom the Celtic
languages were utterly unknown.  <<STOP>>Whence then came these internal marks,
and these proper names of persons and places, the features of a story
usually of earliest date and least likely to change?

<<STOP>><<STOP>>These romances were found in England, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden,
and even Iceland, as early as the beginning of the thirteenth and end of
the twelfth century.  <<STOP>>The Germans, who propagated them through the
nations of the North, derived them certainly from France.  <<STOP>>Robert Wace
published his Anglo-Norman Romance of the Brut d’Angleterre about 1155.
<<STOP>>Sir Tristan was written in French prose in 1170; and The Chevalier au
Lion, Chevalier de l’Epée, and Sir Lancelot du Lac, in metrical French,
by Chrestien de Troyes, before 1200.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>From these facts it is to be argued that the further back these romances
are traced, the more clearly does it appear that they spread over the
Continent from the North-west of France.  <<STOP>>The older versions, it may be
remarked, are far more simple than the later corruptions.  <<STOP>>In them there
is less allusion to the habits and usages of Chivalry, and the Welsh
names and elements stand out in stronger relief.  <<STOP>>It is a great step to
be able to trace the stocks of these romances back to Wace, or to his
country and age.  <<STOP>>For Wace’s work was not original.  <<STOP>>He himself, a native
of Jersey, appears to have derived much of it from the “Historia
Britonum” of Gruffydd ab Arthur, commonly known as “Geoffrey of
Monmouth,” born 1128, who himself professes to have translated from a
British original.  <<STOP>>It is, however, very possible that Wace may have had
access, like Geoffrey, to independent sources of information.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>To the claims set up on behalf of Wace and Geoffrey, to be regarded as
the channels by which the Cymric tales passed into the Continental
Romance, may be added those of a third almost contemporary author.
<<STOP>>Layamon, a Saxon priest, dwelling, about 1200, upon the banks of the
upper Severn, acknowledges for the source of his British history, the
_English_ Bede, the _Latin_ Albin, and the _French_ Wace.  <<STOP>>The last-named
however is by very much his chief, and, for Welsh matters, his only
avowed authority.  <<STOP>>His book, nevertheless, contains a number of names and
stories relating to Wales, of which no traces appear in Wace, or indeed
in Geoffrey, but which he was certainly in a very favourable position to
obtain for himself.  <<STOP>>Layamon, therefore, not only confirms Geoffrey in
some points, but it is clear, that, professing to follow Wace, he had
independent access to the great body of Welsh literature then current.
<<STOP>>Sir F. Madden has put this matter very clearly, in his recent edition of
Layamon.  <<STOP>>The Abbé de la Rue, also, was of opinion that Gaimar, an
Anglo-Norman, in the reign of Stephen, usually regarded as a translator
of Geoffrey of Monmouth, had access to a Welsh independent authority.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>In addition to these, is to be mentioned the English version of Sir
Tristrem, which Sir Walter Scott considered to be derived from a distinct
Celtic source, and not, like the later Amadis, Palmerin, and Lord
Berners’s Canon of Romance, imported into English literature by
translation from the French.  <<STOP>>For the Auntours of Arthur, recently
published by the Camden Society, their Editor, Mr. <<STOP>>Robson, seems to hint
at a similar claim.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>Here then are various known channels, by which portions of Welsh and
Armoric fiction crossed the Celtic border, and gave rise to the more
ornate, and widely-spread romance of the Age of Chivalry.  <<STOP>>It is not
improbable that there may have existed many others.  <<STOP>>It appears then that
a large portion of the stocks of Mediæval Romance proceeded from Wales.
<<STOP>>We have next to see in what condition they are still found in that
country.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>That Wales possessed an ancient literature, containing various lyric
compositions, and certain triads, in which are arranged historical facts
or moral aphorisms, has been shown by Sharon Turner, who has established
the high antiquity of many of these compositions.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>The more strictly Romantic Literature of Wales has been less fortunate,
though not less deserving of critical attention.  <<STOP>>Small portions only of
it have hitherto appeared in print, the remainder being still hidden in
the obscurity of ancient Manuscripts: of these the chief is supposed to
be the Red Book of Hergest, now in the Library of Jesus College, Oxford,
and of the fourteenth century.  <<STOP>>This contains, besides poems, the prose
romances known as Mabinogion.  <<STOP>>The Black Book of Caermarthen, preserved
at Hengwrt, and considered not to be of later date than the twelfth
century, is said to contain poems only. <<STOP>>{1}

<<STOP>>The Mabinogion, however, though thus early recorded in the Welsh tongue,
are in their existing form by no means wholly Welsh.  <<STOP>>They are of two
tolerably distinct classes.  <<STOP>>Of these, the older contains few allusions
to Norman customs, manners, arts, arms, and luxuries.  <<STOP>>The other, and
less ancient, are full of such allusions, and of ecclesiastical terms.
<<STOP>>Both classes, no doubt, are equally of Welsh root, but the former are not
more overlaid or corrupted, than might have been expected, from the
communication that so early took place between the Normans and the Welsh;
whereas the latter probably migrated from Wales, and were brought back
and re-translated after an absence of centuries, with a load of Norman
additions.  <<STOP>>Kilhwch and Olwen, and the dream of Rhonabwy, may be cited as
examples of the older and purer class; the Lady of the Fountain, Peredur,
and Geraint ab Erbin, of the later, or decorated.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>Besides these, indeed, there are a few tales, as Amlyn and Amic, Sir
Bevis of Hamtoun, the Seven Wise Masters, and the story of Charlemagne,
so obviously of foreign extraction, and of late introduction into Wales,
not presenting even a Welsh name, or allusion, and of such very slender
intrinsic merit, that although comprised in the Llyvr Coch, they have not
a shadow of claim to form part of the Canon of Welsh Romance.  <<STOP>>Therefore,
although I have translated and examined them, I have given them no place
in these volumes.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>There is one argument in favour of the high antiquity in Wales of many of
the Mabinogion, which deserves to be mentioned here.  <<STOP>>This argument is
founded on the topography of the country.  <<STOP>>It is found that Saxon names
of places are very frequently definitions of the nature of the locality
to which they are attached, as Clifton, Deepden, Bridge-ford, Thorpe,
Ham, Wick, and the like; whereas those of Wales are more frequently
commemorative of some event, real or supposed, said to have happened on
or near the spot, or bearing allusion to some person renowned in the
story of the country or district.  <<STOP>>Such are “Llyn y Morwynion,” the Lake
of the Maidens; “Rhyd y Bedd,” the Ford of the Grave; “Bryn Cyfergyr,”
the Hill of Assault; and so on.  <<STOP>>But as these names could not have
preceded the events to which they refer, the events themselves must be
not unfrequently as old as the early settlement in the country.  <<STOP>>And as
some of these events and fictions are the subjects of, and are explained
by, existing Welsh legends, it follows that the legends must be, in some
shape or other, of very remote antiquity.  <<STOP>>It will be observed that this
argument supports _remote_ antiquity only for such legends as are
connected with the greater topographical features, as mountains, lakes,
rivers, seas, which must have been named at an early period in the
inhabitation of the country by man.  <<STOP>>But there exist, also, legends
connected with the lesser features, as pools, hills, detached rocks,
caves, fords, and the like, places not necessarily named by the earlier
settlers, but the names of which are, nevertheless, probably very old,
since the words of which they are composed are in many cases not retained
in the colloquial tongue, in which they must once have been included, and
are in some instances lost from the language altogether, so much so as to
be only partially explicable even by scholars.  <<STOP>>The argument applies
likewise, in their degree, to camps, barrows, and other artificial
earth-works.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>Conclusions thus drawn, when established, rest upon a very firm basis.
<<STOP>>They depend upon the number and appositeness of the facts, and it would
be very interesting to pursue this branch of evidence in detail.  <<STOP>>In
following up this idea, the names to be sought for might thus be
classed:—

<<STOP>>I.  Names of the great features, involving proper names and actions.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>Cadair Idris and Cadair Arthur both involve more than a mere name.  <<STOP>>Idris
and Arthur must have been invested with heroic qualifications to have
been placed in such “seats.”

<<STOP>>II.  <<STOP>>Names of lesser features, as “Bryn y Saeth,” Hill of the Dart; “Llyn
Llyngclys,” Lake of the Engulphed Court; “Ceven y Bedd,” the Ridge of the
Grave; “Rhyd y Saeson,” the Saxons’ Ford.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>III.  <<STOP>>Names of mixed natural and artificial objects, as “Coeten Arthur,”
Arthur’s Coit; “Cerrig y Drudion,” the Crag of the Heroes; which involve
actions.  <<STOP>>And such as embody proper names only, as “Cerrig Howell,” the
Crag of Howell; “Caer Arianrod,” the Camp of Arianrod; “Bron Goronwy,”
the Breast (of the Hill) of Goronwy; “Castell mab Wynion,” the Castle of
the son of Wynion; “Nant Gwrtheyrn,” the Rill of Vortigern.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>The selection of names would demand much care and discretion.  <<STOP>>The
translations should be indisputable, and, where known, the connexion of a
name with a legend should be noted.  <<STOP>>Such a name as “Mochdrev,”
Swine-town, would be valueless unless accompanied by a legend.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>It is always valuable to find a place or work called after an individual,
because it may help to support some tradition of his existence or his
actions.  <<STOP>>But it is requisite that care be taken not to push the
etymological dissection too far.  <<STOP>>Thus, “Caer Arianrod” should be taken
simply as the “Camp of Arianrod,” and not rendered the “Camp of the
silver circle,” because the latter, though it might possibly have
something to do with the reason for which the name was borne by Arianrod
herself, had clearly no reference to its application to her camp.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>It appears to me, then, looking back upon what has been advanced:—

<<STOP>>I.  That we have throughout Europe, at an early period, a great body of
literature, known as Mediæval Romance, which, amidst much that is wholly
of Teutonic origin and character, includes certain well-marked traces of
an older Celtic nucleus.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>II.  <<STOP>>Proceeding backwards in time, we find these romances, their
ornaments falling away at each step, existing towards the twelfth
century, of simpler structure, and with less encumbered Celtic features,
in the works of Wace, and other Bards of the Langue d’Oil.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>III.  <<STOP>>We find that Geoffrey of Monmouth, Layamon, and other early British
and Anglo-Saxon historians, and minstrels, on the one hand, transmitted
to Europe the rudiments of its after romance, much of which, on the other
hand, they drew from Wales.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>IV.  <<STOP>>Crossing into Wales we find, in the Mabinogion, the evident
counterpart of the Celtic portion of the continental romance, mixed up,
indeed, with various reflex additions from beyond the border, but still
containing ample internal evidence of a Welsh original.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>V.  Looking at the connexion between divers of the more ancient
Mabinogion, and the topographical nomenclature of part of the country, we
find evidence of the great, though indefinite, antiquity of these tales,
and of an origin, which, if not indigenous, is certainly derived from no
European nation.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>It was with a general belief in some of these conclusions, that I
commenced my labours, and I end them with my impressions strongly
confirmed.  <<STOP>>The subject is one not unworthy of the talents of a Llwyd or
a Prichard.  <<STOP>>It might, I think, be shown, by pursuing the inquiry, that
the Cymric nation is not only, as Dr. <<STOP>>Prichard has proved it to be, an
early offshoot of the Indo-European family, and a people of unmixed
descent, but that when driven out of their conquests by the later
nations, the names and exploits of their heroes, and the compositions of
their bards, spread far and wide among the invaders, and affected
intimately their tastes and literature for many centuries, and that it
has strong claims to be considered the cradle of European Romance.

                                                                  <<STOP>><<STOP>>C. E. G.

<<STOP>>DOWLAIS, _August 29th_, _1848_.




<<STOP>><<STOP>>THE LADY OF THE FOUNTAIN


<<STOP>>KING ARTHUR was at Caerlleon upon Usk; and one day he sat in his chamber;
and with him were Owain the son of Urien, and Kynon the son of Clydno,
and Kai the son of Kyner; and Gwenhwyvar and her handmaidens at
needlework by the window.  <<STOP>>And if it should be said that there was a
porter at Arthur’s palace, there was none.  <<STOP>>Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr was
there, acting as porter, to welcome guests and strangers, and to receive
them with honour, and to inform them of the manners and customs of the
Court; and to direct those who came to the Hall or to the
presence-chamber, and those who came to take up their lodging.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>In the centre of the chamber King Arthur sat upon a seat of green rushes,
over which was spread a covering of flame-coloured satin, and a cushion
of red satin was under his elbow.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>Then Arthur spoke, “If I thought you would not disparage me,” said he, “I
would sleep while I wait for my repast; and you can entertain one another
with relating tales, and can obtain a flagon of mead and some meat from
Kai.”  And the King went to sleep.  <<STOP>>And Kynon the son of Clydno asked Kai
for that which Arthur had promised them.  <<STOP>>“I, too, will have the good
tale which he promised to me,” said Kai.  <<STOP>>“Nay,” answered Kynon, “fairer
will it be for thee to fulfill Arthur’s behest, in the first place, and
then we will tell thee the best tale that we know.”  So Kai went to the
kitchen and to the mead-cellar, and returned bearing a flagon of mead and
a golden goblet, and a handful of skewers, upon which were broiled
collops of meat.  <<STOP>>Then they ate the collops and began to drink the mead.
<<STOP>>“Now,” said Kai, “it is time for you to give me my story.”  “Kynon,” said
Owain, “do thou pay to Kai the tale that is his due.”  “Truly,” said
Kynon, “thou are older, and art a better teller of tales, and hast seen
more marvellous things than I; do thou therefore pay Kai his tale.”
“Begin thyself,” quoth Owain, “with the best that thou knowest.”  “I will
do so,” answered Kynon.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>“I was the only son of my mother and father, and I was exceedingly
aspiring, and my daring was very great.  <<STOP>>I thought there was no
enterprise in the world too mighty for me, and after I had achieved all
the adventures that were in my own country, I equipped myself, and set
forth to journey through deserts and distant regions.  <<STOP>>And at length it
chanced that I came to the fairest valley in the world, wherein were
trees of equal growth; and a river ran through the valley, and a path was
by the side of the river.  <<STOP>>And I followed the path until mid-day, and
continued my journey along the remainder of the valley until the evening;
and at the extremity of a plain I came to a large and lustrous Castle, at
the foot of which was a torrent.  <<STOP>>And I approached the Castle, and there
I beheld two youths with yellow curling hair, each with a frontlet of
gold upon his head, and clad in a garment of yellow satin, and they had
gold clasps upon their insteps.  <<STOP>>In the hand of each of them was an ivory
bow, strung with the sinews of the stag; and their arrows had shafts of
the bone of the whale, and were winged with peacock’s feathers; the
shafts also had golden heads.  <<STOP>>And they had daggers with blades of gold,
and with hilts of the bone of the whale.  <<STOP>>And they were shooting their
daggers.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>“And a little way from them I saw a man in the prime of life, with his
beard newly shorn, clad in a robe and a mantle of yellow satin; and round
the top of his mantle was a band of gold lace.  <<STOP>>On his feet were shoes of
variegated leather, fastened by two bosses of gold.  <<STOP>>When I saw him, I
went towards him and saluted him, and such was his courtesy that he no
sooner received my greeting than he returned it.  <<STOP>>And he went with me
towards the Castle.  <<STOP>>Now there were no dwellers in the Castle except
those who were in one hall.  <<STOP>>And there I saw four-and-twenty damsels,
embroidering satin at a window.  <<STOP>>And this I tell thee, Kai, that the
least fair of them was fairer than the fairest maid thou hast ever beheld
in the Island of Britain, and the least lovely of them was more lovely
than Gwenhwyvar, the wife of Arthur, when she has appeared loveliest at
the Offering, on the day of the Nativity, or at the feast of Easter.
<<STOP>>They rose up at my coming, and six of them took my horse, and divested me
of my armour; and six others took my arms, and washed them in a vessel
until they were perfectly bright.  <<STOP>>And the third six spread cloths upon
the tables and prepared meat.  <<STOP>>And the fourth six took off my soiled
garments, and placed others upon me; namely, an under-vest and a doublet
of fine linen, and a robe, and a surcoat, and a mantle of yellow satin
with a broad gold band upon the mantle.  <<STOP>>And they placed cushions both
beneath and around me, with coverings of red linen; and I sat down.  <<STOP>>Now
the six maidens who had taken my horse, unharnessed him, as well as if
they had been the best squires in the Island of Britain.  <<STOP>>Then, behold,
they brought bowls of silver wherein was water to wash, and towels of
linen, some green and some white; and I washed.  <<STOP>>And in a little while
the man sat down to the table.  <<STOP>>And I sat next to him, and below me sat
all the maidens, except those who waited on us.  <<STOP>>And the table was of
silver, and the cloths upon the table were of linen; and no vessel was
served upon the table that was not either of gold or of silver, or of
buffalo-horn.  <<STOP>>And our meat was brought to us.  <<STOP>>And verily, Kai, I saw
there every sort of meat and every sort of liquor that I have ever seen
elsewhere; but the meat and the liquor were better served there than I
have ever seen them in any other place.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>“Until the repast was half over, neither the man nor any one of the
damsels spoke a single word to me; but when the man perceived that it
would be more agreeable to me to converse than to eat any more, he began
to inquire of me who I was.  <<STOP>>I said I was glad to find that there was
some one who would discourse with me, and that it was not considered so
great a crime at that Court for people to hold converse together.
<<STOP>>‘Chieftain,’ said the man, ‘we would have talked to thee sooner, but we
feared to disturb thee during thy repast; now, however, we will
discourse.’  Then I told the man who I was, and what was the cause of my
journey; and said that I was seeking whether any one was superior to me,
or whether I could gain the mastery over all.  <<STOP>>The man looked upon me,
and he smiled and said, ‘If I did not fear to distress thee too much, I
would show thee that which thou seekest.’  Upon this I became anxious and
sorrowful, and when the man perceived it, he said, ‘If thou wouldest
rather that I should show thee thy disadvantage than thine advantage, I
will do so.  <<STOP>>Sleep here to-night, and in the morning arise early, and
take the road upwards through the valley until thou reachest the wood
through which thou camest hither.  <<STOP>>A little way within the wood thou wilt
meet with a road branching off to the right, by which thou must proceed,
until thou comest to a large sheltered glade with a mound in the centre.
<<STOP>>And thou wilt see a black man of great stature on the top of the mound.
<<STOP>>He is not smaller in size than two of the men of this world.  <<STOP>>He has but
one foot; and one eye in the middle of his forehead.  <<STOP>>And he has a club
of iron, and it is certain that there are no two men in the world who
would not find their burden in that club.  <<STOP>>And he is not a comely man,
but on the contrary he is exceedingly ill-favoured; and he is the
woodward of that wood.  <<STOP>>And thou wilt see a thousand wild animals grazing
around him.  <<STOP>>Inquire of him the way out of the glade, and he will reply
to thee briefly, and will point out the road by which thou shalt find
that which thou art in quest of.’

<<STOP>>“And long seemed that night to me.  <<STOP>>And the next morning I arose and
equipped myself, and mounted my horse, and proceeded straight through the
valley to the wood; and I followed the cross-road which the man had
pointed out to me, till at length I arrived at the glade.  <<STOP>>And there was
I three times more astonished at the number of wild animals that I
beheld, than the man had said I should be.  <<STOP>>And the black man was there,
sitting upon the top of the mound.  <<STOP>>Huge of stature as the man had told
me that he was, I found him to exceed by far the description he had given
me of him.  <<STOP>>As for the iron club which the man had told me was a burden
for two men, I am certain, Kai, that it would be a heavy weight for four
warriors to lift; and this was in the black man’s hand.  <<STOP>>And he only
spoke to me in answer to my questions.  <<STOP>>Then I asked him what power he
held over those animals. <<STOP>>‘I will show thee, little man,’ said he.  <<STOP>>And he
took his club in his hand, and with it he struck a stag a great blow so
that he brayed vehemently, and at his braying the animals came together,
as numerous as the stars in the sky, so that it was difficult for me to
find room in the glade to stand among them.  <<STOP>>There were serpents, and
dragons, and divers sorts of animals.  <<STOP>>And he looked at them, and bade
them go and feed; and they bowed their heads, and did him homage as
vassals to their lord.

<<STOP>><<STOP>>“Then the black man said to me, ‘Seest thou now, little man, what power I
hold over these animals?’  Then I inquired of him the way, and he became
very rough in his manner to me; however, he asked me whither I would go?
<<STOP>>And when I told him who I was and what I sought, he directed me.  <<STOP>>‘Take,’
said he, ‘that path that leads towards the head of the glade, and ascend
the wooded steep until thou comest to its summit; and there thou wilt
find an open space like to a large valley, and in the midst of it a tall
tree, whose branches are greener than the greenest pine-trees.  <<STOP>>Under
this tree is a fountain, and by the side of the fountain a marble slab,
and on the marble slab a silver bowl, attached by a chain of silver, so
that it may not be carried away.  <<STOP>>Take the bowl and throw a bowlful of
water upon the slab, and thou wilt hear a mighty peal of thunder, so that
thou wilt think that heaven and earth are trembling with its fury.  <<STOP>>With
the thunder there will come a shower so severe that it will be scarce
possible for thee to endure it and live.  <<STOP>>And the shower will be of
hailstones; and after the shower, the weather will become fair, but every
leaf that was upon the tree will have been carried away by the shower.
<<STOP>>Then a flight of birds will come and alight upon the tree; and in thine
own country thou didst never hear a strain so sweet as that which they
will sing.  <<STOP>>And at the moment thou art most delighted with the song of
the birds, thou wilt hear a murmuring and complaining coming towards thee
along the valley.  <<STOP>>And thou wilt see a knight upon a coal-black horse,
clothed in black velvet, and with a pennon of black linen upon his lance;
and he will ride unto thee to encounter thee with the utmost speed.  <<STOP>>If
thou fleest from him he will overtake thee, and if thou abidest there, as
sure as thou art a mounted knight, he will leave thee on foot.  <<STOP>>And if
thou dost not find trouble in that adventure, thou needest not seek it
during the rest of thy life.’

<<STOP>>“So I journeyed on, until I reached the summit of the steep, and there I
found everything as the black man had described it to me.  <<STOP>>And I went up
to the tree, and beneath it I saw the fountain, and by its side the
marble slab, and the silver bowl fastened by the chain.  <<STOP>>Then I took the
bowl, and cast a bowlful of water upon the slab; and thereupon, behold,
the thunder came, much more violent than the black man had led me to
expect; and after the thunder came the shower; and of a truth I tell
thee, Kai, that there is neither man nor beast that can endure that
shower and live.  <<STOP>>For not one of those hailstones would be stopped,
either by the flesh or by the skin, until it had reached the bone.  <<STOP>>I
turned my horse’s flank towards the shower, and placed the beak of my
shield over his head and neck, while I held the upper part of it over my
own head.  <<STOP>>And thus I withstood the shower.  <<STOP>>When I looked on the tree
there was not a single leaf upon it, and then the sky became clear, and
