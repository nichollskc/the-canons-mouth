     Conquests Of Justinian In The West.—Character And First Campaigns
     Of Belisarius—He Invades And Subdues The Vandal Kingdom Of
     Africa—His Triumph.—The Gothic War.—He Recovers Sicily, Naples,
     And Rome.—Siege Of Rome By The Goths.—Their Retreat And
     Losses.—Surrender Of Ravenna.— Glory Of Belisarius.—His Domestic
     Shame And Misfortunes.

      When Justinian ascended the throne, about fifty years after the
      fall of the Western empire, the kingdoms of the Goths and Vandals
      had obtained a solid, and, as it might seem, a legal
      establishment both in Europe and Africa. The titles, which Roman
      victory had inscribed, were erased with equal justice by the
      sword of the Barbarians; and their successful rapine derived a
      more venerable sanction from time, from treaties, and from the
      oaths of fidelity, already repeated by a second or third
      generation of obedient subjects. Experience and Christianity had
      refuted the superstitious hope, that Rome was founded by the gods
      to reign forever over the nations of the earth. But the proud
      claim of perpetual and indefeasible dominion, which her soldiers
      could no longer maintain, was firmly asserted by her statesmen
      and lawyers, whose opinions have been sometimes revived and
      propagated in the modern schools of jurisprudence. After Rome
      herself had been stripped of the Imperial purple, the princes of
      Constantinople assumed the sole and sacred sceptre of the
      monarchy; demanded, as their rightful inheritance, the provinces
      which had been subdued by the consuls, or possessed by the
      Caesars; and feebly aspired to deliver their faithful subjects of
      the West from the usurpation of heretics and Barbarians. The
      execution of this splendid design was in some degree reserved for
      Justinian. During the five first years of his reign, he
      reluctantly waged a costly and unprofitable war against the
      Persians; till his pride submitted to his ambition, and he
      purchased at the price of four hundred and forty thousand pounds
      sterling, the benefit of a precarious truce, which, in the
      language of both nations, was dignified with the appellation of
      the endless peace. The safety of the East enabled the emperor to
      employ his forces against the Vandals; and the internal state of
      Africa afforded an honorable motive, and promised a powerful
      support, to the Roman arms. 1

      1 (return) [ The complete series of the Vandal war is related by
      Procopius in a regular and elegant narrative, (l. i. c. 9—25, l.
      ii. c. 1—13,) and happy would be my lot, could I always tread in
      the footsteps of such a guide. From the entire and diligent
      perusal of the Greek text, I have a right to pronounce that the
      Latin and French versions of Grotius and Cousin may not be
      implicitly trusted; yet the president Cousin has been often
      praised, and Hugo Grotius was the first scholar of a learned
      age.]

      According to the testament of the founder, the African kingdom
      had lineally descended to Hilderic, the eldest of the Vandal
      princes. A mild disposition inclined the son of a tyrant, the
      grandson of a conqueror, to prefer the counsels of clemency and
      peace; and his accession was marked by the salutary edict, which
      restored two hundred bishops to their churches, and allowed the
      free profession of the Athanasian creed. 2 But the Catholics
      accepted, with cold and transient gratitude, a favor so
      inadequate to their pretensions, and the virtues of Hilderic
      offended the prejudices of his countrymen. The Arian clergy
      presumed to insinuate that he had renounced the faith, and the
      soldiers more loudly complained that he had degenerated from the
      courage, of his ancestors. His ambassadors were suspected of a
      secret and disgraceful negotiation in the Byzantine court; and
      his general, the Achilles, 3 as he was named, of the Vandals,
      lost a battle against the naked and disorderly Moors. The public
      discontent was exasperated by Gelimer, whose age, descent, and
      military fame, gave him an apparent title to the succession: he
      assumed, with the consent of the nation, the reins of government;
      and his unfortunate sovereign sunk without a struggle from the
      throne to a dungeon, where he was strictly guarded with a
      faithful counsellor, and his unpopular nephew the Achilles of the
      Vandals. But the indulgence which Hilderic had shown to his
      Catholic subjects had powerfully recommended him to the favor of
      Justinian, who, for the benefit of his own sect, could
      acknowledge the use and justice of religious toleration: their
      alliance, while the nephew of Justin remained in a private
      station, was cemented by the mutual exchange of gifts and
      letters; and the emperor Justinian asserted the cause of royalty
      and friendship. In two successive embassies, he admonished the
      usurper to repent of his treason, or to abstain, at least, from
      any further violence which might provoke the displeasure of God
      and of the Romans; to reverence the laws of kindred and
      succession, and to suffer an infirm old man peaceably to end his
      days, either on the throne of Carthage or in the palace of
      Constantinople. The passions, or even the prudence, of Gelimer
      compelled him to reject these requests, which were urged in the
      haughty tone of menace and command; and he justified his ambition
      in a language rarely spoken in the Byzantine court, by alleging
      the right of a free people to remove or punish their chief
      magistrate, who had failed in the execution of the kingly office.

      After this fruitless expostulation, the captive monarch was more
      rigorously treated, his nephew was deprived of his eyes, and the
      cruel Vandal, confident in his strength and distance, derided the
      vain threats and slow preparations of the emperor of the East.
      Justinian resolved to deliver or revenge his friend, Gelimer to
      maintain his usurpation; and the war was preceded, according to
      the practice of civilized nations, by the most solemn
      protestations, that each party was sincerely desirous of peace.

      2 (return) [ See Ruinart, Hist. Persecut. Vandal. c. xii. p. 589.
      His best evidence is drawn from the life of St. Fulgentius,
      composed by one of his disciples, transcribed in a great measure
      in the annals of Baronius, and printed in several great
      collections, (Catalog. Bibliot. Bunavianae, tom. i. vol. ii. p.
      1258.)]

      3 (return) [ For what quality of the mind or body? For speed, or
      beauty, or valor?—In what language did the Vandals read
      Homer?—Did he speak German?—The Latins had four versions,
      (Fabric. tom. i. l. ii. c. 8, p. 297:) yet, in spite of the
      praises of Seneca, (Consol. c. 26,) they appear to have been more
      successful in imitating than in translating the Greek poets. But
      the name of Achilles might be famous and popular even among the
      illiterate Barbarians.]

      The report of an African war was grateful only to the vain and
      idle populace of Constantinople, whose poverty exempted them from
      tribute, and whose cowardice was seldom exposed to military
      service. But the wiser citizens, who judged of the future by the
      past, revolved in their memory the immense loss, both of men and
      money, which the empire had sustained in the expedition of
      Basiliscus. The troops, which, after five laborious campaigns,
      had been recalled from the Persian frontier, dreaded the sea, the
      climate, and the arms of an unknown enemy. The ministers of the
      finances computed, as far as they might compute, the demands of
      an African war; the taxes which must be found and levied to
      supply those insatiate demands; and the danger, lest their own
      lives, or at least their lucrative employments, should be made
      responsible for the deficiency of the supply. Inspired by such
      selfish motives, (for we may not suspect him of any zeal for the
      public good,) John of Cappadocia ventured to oppose in full
      council the inclinations of his master. He confessed, that a
      victory of such importance could not be too dearly purchased; but
      he represented in a grave discourse the certain difficulties and
      the uncertain event. “You undertake,” said the praefect, “to
      besiege Carthage: by land, the distance is not less than one
      hundred and forty days’ journey; on the sea, a whole year 4 must
      elapse before you can receive any intelligence from your fleet.
      If Africa should be reduced, it cannot be preserved without the
      additional conquest of Sicily and Italy. Success will impose the
      obligations of new labors; a single misfortune will attract the
      Barbarians into the heart of your exhausted empire.” Justinian
      felt the weight of this salutary advice; he was confounded by the
      unwonted freedom of an obsequious servant; and the design of the
      war would perhaps have been relinquished, if his courage had not
      been revived by a voice which silenced the doubts of profane
      reason. “I have seen a vision,” cried an artful or fanatic bishop
      of the East. “It is the will of Heaven, O emperor! that you
      should not abandon your holy enterprise for the deliverance of
      the African church. The God of battles will march before your
      standard, and disperse your enemies, who are the enemies of his
      Son.” The emperor, might be tempted, and his counsellors were
      constrained, to give credit to this seasonable revelation: but
      they derived more rational hope from the revolt, which the
      adherents of Hilderic or Athanasius had already excited on the
      borders of the Vandal monarchy. Pudentius, an African subject,
      had privately signified his loyal intentions, and a small
      military aid restored the province of Tripoli to the obedience of
      the Romans. The government of Sardinia had been intrusted to
      Godas, a valiant Barbarian he suspended the payment of tribute,
      disclaimed his allegiance to the usurper, and gave audience to
      the emissaries of Justinian, who found him master of that
      fruitful island, at the head of his guards, and proudly invested
      with the ensigns of royalty. The forces of the Vandals were
      diminished by discord and suspicion; the Roman armies were
      animated by the spirit of Belisarius; one of those heroic names
      which are familiar to every age and to every nation.

      4 (return) [ A year—absurd exaggeration! The conquest of Africa
      may be dated A. D 533, September 14. It is celebrated by
      Justinian in the preface to his Institutes, which were published
      November 21 of the same year. Including the voyage and return,
      such a computation might be truly applied to our Indian empire.]

      The Africanus of new Rome was born, and perhaps educated, among
      the Thracian peasants, 5 without any of those advantages which
      had formed the virtues of the elder and younger Scipio; a noble
      origin, liberal studies, and the emulation of a free state.

      The silence of a loquacious secretary may be admitted, to prove
      that the youth of Belisarius could not afford any subject of
      praise: he served, most assuredly with valor and reputation,
      among the private guards of Justinian; and when his patron became
      emperor, the domestic was promoted to military command. After a
      bold inroad into Persarmenia, in which his glory was shared by a
      colleague, and his progress was checked by an enemy, Belisarius
      repaired to the important station of Dara, where he first
      accepted the service of Procopius, the faithful companion, and
      diligent historian, of his exploits. 6 The Mirranes of Persia
      advanced, with forty thousand of her best troops, to raze the
      fortifications of Dara; and signified the day and the hour on
      which the citizens should prepare a bath for his refreshment,
      after the toils of victory. He encountered an adversary equal to
      himself, by the new title of General of the East; his superior in
      the science of war, but much inferior in the number and quality
      of his troops, which amounted only to twenty-five thousand Romans
      and strangers, relaxed in their discipline, and humbled by recent
      disasters. As the level plain of Dara refused all shelter to
      stratagem and ambush, Belisarius protected his front with a deep
      trench, which was prolonged at first in perpendicular, and
      afterwards in parallel, lines, to cover the wings of cavalry
      advantageously posted to command the flanks and rear of the
      enemy. When the Roman centre was shaken, their well-timed and
      rapid charge decided the conflict: the standard of Persia fell;
      the immortals fled; the infantry threw away their bucklers, and
      eight thousand of the vanquished were left on the field of
      battle. In the next campaign, Syria was invaded on the side of
      the desert; and Belisarius, with twenty thousand men, hastened
      from Dara to the relief of the province. During the whole summer,
      the designs of the enemy were baffled by his skilful
      dispositions: he pressed their retreat, occupied each night their
      camp of the preceding day, and would have secured a bloodless
      victory, if he could have resisted the impatience of his own
      troops. Their valiant promise was faintly supported in the hour
      of battle; the right wing was exposed by the treacherous or
      cowardly desertion of the Christian Arabs; the Huns, a veteran
      band of eight hundred warriors, were oppressed by superior
      numbers; the flight of the Isaurians was intercepted; but the
      Roman infantry stood firm on the left; for Belisarius himself,
      dismounting from his horse, showed them that intrepid despair was
      their only safety. 611 They turned their backs to the Euphrates,
      and their faces to the enemy: innumerable arrows glanced without
      effect from the compact and shelving order of their bucklers; an
      impenetrable line of pikes was opposed to the repeated assaults
      of the Persian cavalry; and after a resistance of many hours, the
      remaining troops were skilfully embarked under the shadow of the
      night. The Persian commander retired with disorder and disgrace,
      to answer a strict account of the lives of so many soldiers,
      which he had consumed in a barren victory. But the fame of
      Belisarius was not sullied by a defeat, in which he alone had
      saved his army from the consequences of their own rashness: the
      approach of peace relieved him from the guard of the eastern
      frontier, and his conduct in the sedition of Constantinople amply
      discharged his obligations to the emperor. When the African war
      became the topic of popular discourse and secret deliberation,
      each of the Roman generals was apprehensive, rather than
      ambitious, of the dangerous honor; but as soon as Justinian had
      declared his preference of superior merit, their envy was
      rekindled by the unanimous applause which was given to the choice
      of Belisarius. The temper of the Byzantine court may encourage a
      suspicion, that the hero was darkly assisted by the intrigues of
      his wife, the fair and subtle Antonina, who alternately enjoyed
      the confidence, and incurred the hatred, of the empress Theodora.

      The birth of Antonina was ignoble; she descended from a family of
      charioteers; and her chastity has been stained with the foulest
      reproach. Yet she reigned with long and absolute power over the
      mind of her illustrious husband; and if Antonina disdained the
      merit of conjugal fidelity, she expressed a manly friendship to
      Belisarius, whom she accompanied with undaunted resolution in all
      the hardships and dangers of a military life. 7

      ecclesiastical lists of the provinces and cities. Note *: M. von
      Hammer (in a review of Lord Mahon’s Life of Belisarius in the
      Vienna Jahrbucher) shows that the name of Belisarius is a
      Sclavonic word, Beli-tzar, the White Prince, and that the place
      of his birth was a village of Illvria, which still bears the name
      of Germany.—M.]

      7 (return) [ See the birth and character of Antonina, in the
      Anecdotes, c. l. and the notes of Alemannus, p. 3.]

      The preparations for the African war were not unworthy of the
      last contest between Rome and Carthage. The pride and flower of
      the army consisted of the guards of Belisarius, who, according to
      the pernicious indulgence of the times, devoted themselves, by a
      particular oath of fidelity, to the service of their patrons.
      Their strength and stature, for which they had been curiously
      selected, the goodness of their horses and armor, and the
      assiduous practice of all the exercises of war, enabled them to
      act whatever their courage might prompt; and their courage was
      exalted by the social honor of their rank, and the personal
      ambition of favor and fortune. Four hundred of the bravest of the
      Heruli marched under the banner of the faithful and active
      Pharas; their untractable valor was more highly prized than the
      tame submission of the Greeks and Syrians; and of such importance
      was it deemed to procure a reenforcement of six hundred
      Massagetae, or Huns, that they were allured by fraud and deceit
      to engage in a naval expedition. Five thousand horse and ten
      thousand foot were embarked at Constantinople, for the conquest
      of Africa; but the infantry, for the most part levied in Thrace
      and Isauria, yielded to the more prevailing use and reputation of
      the cavalry; and the Scythian bow was the weapon on which the
      armies of Rome were now reduced to place their principal
      dependence. From a laudable desire to assert the dignity of his
      theme, Procopius defends the soldiers of his own time against the
      morose critics, who confined that respectable name to the
      heavy-armed warriors of antiquity, and maliciously observed, that
      the word archer is introduced by Homer as a term of contempt.
      “Such contempt might perhaps be due to the naked youths who
      appeared on foot in the fields of Troy, and lurking behind a
      tombstone, or the shield of a friend, drew the bow-string to
      their breast, 9 and dismissed a feeble and lifeless arrow. But
      our archers (pursues the historian) are mounted on horses, which
      they manage with admirable skill; their head and shoulders are
      protected by a casque or buckler; they wear greaves of iron on
      their legs, and their bodies are guarded by a coat of mail. On
      their right side hangs a quiver, a sword on their left, and their
      hand is accustomed to wield a lance or javelin in closer combat.
      Their bows are strong and weighty; they shoot in every possible
      direction, advancing, retreating, to the front, to the rear, or
      to either flank; and as they are taught to draw the bow-string
      not to the breast, but to the right ear, firm indeed must be the
      armor that can resist the rapid violence of their shaft.” Five
      hundred transports, navigated by twenty thousand mariners of
      Egypt, Cilicia, and Ionia, were collected in the harbor of
      Constantinople. The smallest of these vessels may be computed at
      thirty, the largest at five hundred, tons; and the fair average
      will supply an allowance, liberal, but not profuse, of about one
      hundred thousand tons, 10 for the reception of thirty-five
      thousand soldiers and sailors, of five thousand horses, of arms,
      engines, and military stores, and of a sufficient stock of water
      and provisions for a voyage, perhaps, of three months. The proud
      galleys, which in former ages swept the Mediterranean with so
      many hundred oars, had long since disappeared; and the fleet of
      Justinian was escorted only by ninety-two light brigantines,
      covered from the missile weapons of the enemy, and rowed by two
      thousand of the brave and robust youth of Constantinople.
      Twenty-two generals are named, most of whom were afterwards
      distinguished in the wars of Africa and Italy: but the supreme
      command, both by land and sea, was delegated to Belisarius alone,
      with a boundless power of acting according to his discretion, as
      if the emperor himself were present. The separation of the naval
      and military professions is at once the effect and the cause of
      the modern improvements in the science of navigation and maritime
      war. [Footnote 8: See the preface of Procopius. The enemies of
      archery might quote the reproaches of Diomede (Iliad. Delta. 385,
      &c.) and the permittere vulnera ventis of Lucan, (viii. 384:) yet
      the Romans could not despise the arrows of the Parthians; and in
      the siege of Troy, Pandarus, Paris, and Teucer, pierced those
      haughty warriors who insulted them as women or children.]

      9 (return) [ (Iliad. Delta. 123.) How concise—how just—how
      beautiful is the whole picture! I see the attitudes of the
      archer—I hear the twanging of the bow.]

      10 (return) [ The text appears to allow for the largest vessels
      50,000 medimni, or 3000 tons, (since the medimnus weighed 160
      Roman, or 120 avoirdupois, pounds.) I have given a more rational
      interpretation, by supposing that the Attic style of Procopius
      conceals the legal and popular modius, a sixth part of the
      medimnus, (Hooper’s Ancient Measures, p. 152, &c.) A contrary and
      indeed a stranger mistake has crept into an oration of Dinarchus,
      (contra Demosthenem, in Reiske Orator. Graec tom iv. P. ii. p.
      34.) By reducing the number of ships from 500 to 50, and
      translating by mines, or pounds, Cousin has generously allowed
      500 tons for the whole of the Imperial fleet! Did he never
      think?]

      In the seventh year of the reign of Justinian, and about the time
      of the summer solstice, the whole fleet of six hundred ships was
      ranged in martial pomp before the gardens of the palace. The
      patriarch pronounced his benediction, the emperor signified his
      last commands, the general’s trumpet gave the signal of
      departure, and every heart, according to its fears or wishes,
      explored, with anxious curiosity, the omens of misfortune and
      success. The first halt was made at Perinthus or Heraclea, where
      Belisarius waited five days to receive some Thracian horses, a
      military gift of his sovereign. From thence the fleet pursued
      their course through the midst of the Propontis; but as they
      struggled to pass the Straits of the Hellespont, an unfavorable
      wind detained them four days at Abydus, where the general
      exhibited a memorable lesson of firmness and severity. Two of the
      Huns, who in a drunken quarrel had slain one of their
      fellow-soldiers, were instantly shown to the army suspended on a
      lofty gibbet. The national indignity was resented by their
      countrymen, who disclaimed the servile laws of the empire, and
      asserted the free privilege of Scythia, where a small fine was
      allowed to expiate the hasty sallies of intemperance and anger.
      Their complaints were specious, their clamors were loud, and the
      Romans were not averse to the example of disorder and impunity.
      But the rising sedition was appeased by the authority and
      eloquence of the general: and he represented to the assembled
      troops the obligation of justice, the importance of discipline,
      the rewards of piety and virtue, and the unpardonable guilt of
      murder, which, in his apprehension, was aggravated rather than
      excused by the vice of intoxication. 11 In the navigation from
      the Hellespont to Peloponnesus, which the Greeks, after the siege
      of Troy, had performed in four days, 12 the fleet of Belisarius
      was guided in their course by his master-galley, conspicuous in
      the day by the redness of the sails, and in the night by the
      torches blazing from the mast head. It was the duty of the
      pilots, as they steered between the islands, and turned the Capes
      of Malea and Taenarium, to preserve the just order and regular
      intervals of such a multitude of ships: as the wind was fair and
      moderate, their labors were not unsuccessful, and the troops were
      safely disembarked at Methone on the Messenian coast, to repose
      themselves for a while after the fatigues of the sea. In this
      place they experienced how avarice, invested with authority, may
      sport with the lives of thousands which are bravely exposed for
      the public service. According to military practice, the bread or
      biscuit of the Romans was twice prepared in the oven, and the
      diminution of one fourth was cheerfully allowed for the loss of
      weight. To gain this miserable profit, and to save the expense of
      wood, the praefect John of Cappadocia had given orders that the
      flour should be slightly baked by the same fire which warmed the
      baths of Constantinople; and when the sacks were opened, a soft
      and mouldy paste was distributed to the army. Such unwholesome
      food, assisted by the heat of the climate and season, soon
      produced an epidemical disease, which swept away five hundred
      soldiers. Their health was restored by the diligence of
      Belisarius, who provided fresh bread at Methone, and boldly
      expressed his just and humane indignation; the emperor heard his
      complaint; the general was praised but the minister was not
      punished. From the port of Methone, the pilots steered along the
      western coast of Peloponnesus, as far as the Isle of Zacynthus,
      or Zante, before they undertook the voyage (in their eyes a most
      arduous voyage) of one hundred leagues over the Ionian Sea. As
      the fleet was surprised by a calm, sixteen days were consumed in
      the slow navigation; and even the general would have suffered the
      intolerable hardship of thirst, if the ingenuity of Antonina had
      not preserved the water in glass bottles, which she buried deep
      in the sand in a part of the ship impervious to the rays of the
      sun. At length the harbor of Caucana, 13 on the southern side of
      Sicily, afforded a secure and hospitable shelter. The Gothic
      officers who governed the island in the name of the daughter and
      grandson of Theodoric, obeyed their imprudent orders, to receive
      the troops of Justinian like friends and allies: provisions were
      liberally supplied, the cavalry was remounted, 14 and Procopius
      soon returned from Syracuse with correct information of the state
      and designs of the Vandals. His intelligence determined
      Belisarius to hasten his operations, and his wise impatience was
      seconded by the winds. The fleet lost sight of Sicily, passed
      before the Isle of Malta, discovered the capes of Africa, ran
      along the coast with a strong gale from the north-east, and
      finally cast anchor at the promontory of Caput Vada, about five
      days’ journey to the south of Carthage. 15

      If Gelimer had been informed of the approach of the enemy, he
      must have delayed the conquest of Sardinia for the immediate
      defence of his person and kingdom. A detachment of five thousand
      soldiers, and one hundred and twenty galleys, would have joined
      the remaining forces of the Vandals; and the descendant of
      Genseric might have surprised and oppressed a fleet of deep laden
      transports, incapable of action, and of light brigantines that
      seemed only qualified for flight. Belisarius had secretly
      trembled when he overheard his soldiers, in the passage,
      emboldening each other to confess their apprehensions: if they
      were once on shore, they hoped to maintain the honor of their
      arms; but if they should be attacked at sea, they did not blush
      to acknowledge that they wanted courage to contend at the same
      time with the winds, the waves, and the Barbarians. 16 The
      knowledge of their sentiments decided Belisarius to seize the
      first opportunity of landing them on the coast of Africa; and he
      prudently rejected, in a council of war, the proposal of sailing
      with the fleet and army into the port of Carthage. 1611 Three
      months after their departure from Constantinople, the men and
      horses, the arms and military stores, were safely disembarked,
      and five soldiers were left as a guard on board each of the
      ships, which were disposed in the form of a semicircle. The
      remainder of the troops occupied a camp on the sea-shore, which
      they fortified, according to ancient discipline, with a ditch and
      rampart; and the discovery of a source of fresh water, while it
      allayed the thirst, excited the superstitious confidence, of the
      Romans. The next morning, some of the neighboring gardens were
      pillaged; and Belisarius, after chastising the offenders,
      embraced the slight occasion, but the decisive moment, of
      inculcating the maxims of justice, moderation, and genuine
      policy. “When I first accepted the commission of subduing Africa,
      I depended much less,” said the general, “on the numbers, or even
      the bravery of my troops, than on the friendly disposition of the
      natives, and their immortal hatred to the Vandals. You alone can
      deprive me of this hope; if you continue to extort by rapine what
      might be purchased for a little money, such acts of violence will
      reconcile these implacable enemies, and unite them in a just and
      holy league against the invaders of their country.” These
      exhortations were enforced by a rigid discipline, of which the
      soldiers themselves soon felt and praised the salutary effects.
      The inhabitants, instead of deserting their houses, or hiding
      their corn, supplied the Romans with a fair and liberal market:
      the civil officers of the province continued to exercise their
      functions in the name of Justinian: and the clergy, from motives
      of conscience and interest, assiduously labored to promote the
      cause of a Catholic emperor. The small town of Sullecte, 17 one
      day’s journey from the camp, had the honor of being foremost to
      open her gates, and to resume her ancient allegiance: the larger
      cities of Leptis and Adrumetum imitated the example of loyalty as
      soon as Belisarius appeared; and he advanced without opposition
      as far as Grasse, a palace of the Vandal kings, at the distance
      of fifty miles from Carthage. The weary Romans indulged
      themselves in the refreshment of shady groves, cool fountains,
      and delicious fruits; and the preference which Procopius allows
      to these gardens over any that he had seen, either in the East or
      West, may be ascribed either to the taste, or the fatigue, of the
      historian. In three generations, prosperity and a warm climate
      had dissolved the hardy virtue of the Vandals, who insensibly
      became the most luxurious of mankind. In their villas and
      gardens, which might deserve the Persian name of Paradise, 18
      they enjoyed a cool and elegant repose; and, after the daily use
      of the bath, the Barbarians were seated at a table profusely
      spread with the delicacies of the land and sea. Their silken
      robes loosely flowing, after the fashion of the Medes, were
      embroidered with gold; love and hunting were the labors of their
      life, and their vacant hours were amused by pantomimes,
      chariot-races, and the music and dances of the theatre.

      Tatius. l. i. p. 22, 23.)]

      In a march of ten or twelve days, the vigilance of Belisarius was
      constantly awake and active against his unseen enemies, by whom,
      in every place, and at every hour, he might be suddenly attacked.
      An officer of confidence and merit, John the Armenian, led the
      vanguard of three hundred horse; six hundred Massagetae covered
      at a certain distance the left flank; and the whole fleet,
      steering along the coast, seldom lost sight of the army, which
      moved each day about twelve miles, and lodged in the evening in
      strong camps, or in friendly towns. The near approach of the
      Romans to Carthage filled the mind of Gelimer with anxiety and
      terror. He prudently wished to protract the war till his brother,
      with his veteran troops, should return from the conquest of
      Sardinia; and he now lamented the rash policy of his ancestors,
      who, by destroying the fortifications of Africa, had left him
      only the dangerous resource of risking a battle in the
      neighborhood of his capital. The Vandal conquerors, from their
      original number of fifty thousand, were multiplied, without
      including their women and children, to one hundred and sixty
      thousand fighting men: 1811 and such forces, animated with valor
      and union, might have crushed, at their first landing, the feeble
      and exhausted bands of the Roman general. But the friends of the
      captive king were more inclined to accept the invitations, than
      to resist the progress, of Belisarius; and many a proud Barbarian
      disguised his aversion to war under the more specious name of his
      hatred to the usurper. Yet the authority and promises of Gelimer
      collected a formidable army, and his plans were concerted with
      some degree of military skill. An order was despatched to his
      brother Ammatas, to collect all the forces of Carthage, and to
      encounter the van of the Roman army at the distance of ten miles
      from the city: his nephew Gibamund, with two thousand horse, was
      destined to attack their left, when the monarch himself, who
      silently followed, should charge their rear, in a situation which
      excluded them from the aid or even the view of their fleet. But
      the rashness of Ammatas was fatal to himself and his country. He
      anticipated the hour of the attack, outstripped his tardy
      followers, and was pierced with a mortal wound, after he had
      slain with his own hand twelve of his boldest antagonists. His
      Vandals fled to Carthage; the highway, almost ten miles, was
      strewed with dead bodies; and it seemed incredible that such
      multitudes could be slaughtered by the swords of three hundred
      Romans. The nephew of Gelimer was defeated, after a slight
      combat, by the six hundred Massagetae: they did not equal the
      third part of his numbers; but each Scythian was fired by the
      example of his chief, who gloriously exercised the privilege of
      his family, by riding, foremost and alone, to shoot the first
      arrow against the enemy. In the mean while, Gelimer himself,
      ignorant of the event, and misguided by the windings of the
      hills, inadvertently passed the Roman army, and reached the scene
      of action where Ammatas had fallen. He wept the fate of his
      brother and of Carthage, charged with irresistible fury the
      advancing squadrons, and might have pursued, and perhaps decided,
      the victory, if he had not wasted those inestimable moments in
      the discharge of a vain, though pious, duty to the dead. While
      his spirit was broken by this mournful office, he heard the
      trumpet of Belisarius, who, leaving Antonina and his infantry in
      the camp, pressed forwards with his guards and the remainder of
      the cavalry to rally his flying troops, and to restore the
      fortune of the day. Much room could not be found, in this
      disorderly battle, for the talents of a general; but the king
      fled before the hero; and the Vandals, accustomed only to a
      Moorish enemy, were incapable of withstanding the arms and
      discipline of the Romans. Gelimer retired with hasty steps
      towards the desert of Numidia: but he had soon the consolation of
      learning that his private orders for the execution of Hilderic
      and his captive friends had been faithfully obeyed. The tyrant’s
      revenge was useful only to his enemies. The death of a lawful
      prince excited the compassion of his people; his life might have
      perplexed the victorious Romans; and the lieutenant of Justinian,
      by a crime of which he was innocent, was relieved from the
      painful alternative of forfeiting his honor or relinquishing his
      conquests.

      Chapter XLI: Conquests Of Justinian, Charact Of Balisarius.—Part
      II.

      As soon as the tumult had subsided, the several parts of the army
      informed each other of the accidents of the day; and Belisarius
      pitched his camp on the field of victory, to which the tenth
      mile-stone from Carthage had applied the Latin appellation of
      Decimus. From a wise suspicion of the stratagems and resources of
      the Vandals, he marched the next day in order of battle, halted
      in the evening before the gates of Carthage, and allowed a night
      of repose, that he might not, in darkness and disorder, expose
      the city to the license of the soldiers, or the soldiers
      themselves to the secret ambush of the city. But as the fears of
      Belisarius were the result of calm and intrepid reason, he was
      soon satisfied that he might confide, without danger, in the
      peaceful and friendly aspect of the capital. Carthage blazed with
      innumerable torches, the signals of the public joy; the chain was
      removed that guarded the entrance of the port; the gates were
      thrown open, and the people, with acclamations of gratitude,
      hailed and invited their Roman deliverers. The defeat of the
      Vandals, and the freedom of Africa, were announced to the city on
      the eve of St. Cyprian, when the churches were already adorned
      and illuminated for the festival of the martyr whom three
      centuries of superstition had almost raised to a local deity. The
      Arians, conscious that their reign had expired, resigned the
      temple to the Catholics, who rescued their saint from profane
      hands, performed the holy rites, and loudly proclaimed the creed
      of Athanasius and Justinian. One awful hour reversed the fortunes
      of the contending parties. The suppliant Vandals, who had so
      lately indulged the vices of conquerors, sought an humble refuge
      in the sanctuary of the church; while the merchants of the East
      were delivered from the deepest dungeon of the palace by their
      affrighted keeper, who implored the protection of his captives,
      and showed them, through an aperture in the wall, the sails of
      the Roman fleet. After their separation from the army, the naval
      commanders had proceeded with slow caution along the coast till
      they reached the Hermaean promontory, and obtained the first
      intelligence of the victory of Belisarius. Faithful to his
      instructions, they would have cast anchor about twenty miles from
      Carthage, if the more skilful seamen had not represented the
      perils of the shore, and the signs of an impending tempest. Still
      ignorant of the revolution, they declined, however, the rash
      attempt of forcing the chain of the port; and the adjacent harbor
      and suburb of Mandracium were insulted only by the rapine of a
      private officer, who disobeyed and deserted his leaders. But the
      Imperial fleet, advancing with a fair wind, steered through the
      narrow entrance of the Goletta, and occupied, in the deep and
      capacious lake of Tunis, a secure station about five miles from
      the capital. 19 No sooner was Belisarius informed of their
      arrival, than he despatched orders that the greatest part of the
      mariners should be immediately landed to join the triumph, and to
      swell the apparent numbers, of the Romans. Before he allowed them
      to enter the gates of Carthage, he exhorted them, in a discourse
      worthy of himself and the occasion, not to disgrace the glory of
      their arms; and to remember that the Vandals had been the
      tyrants, but that they were the deliverers, of the Africans, who
      must now be respected as the voluntary and affectionate subjects
      of their common sovereign. The Romans marched through the streets
      in close ranks prepared for battle if an enemy had appeared: the
      strict order maintained by the general imprinted on their minds
      the duty of obedience; and in an age in which custom and impunity
      almost sanctified the abuse of conquest, the genius of one man
      repressed the passions of a victorious army. The voice of menace
      and complaint was silent; the trade of Carthage was not
      interrupted; while Africa changed her master and her government,
      the shops continued open and busy; and the soldiers, after
      sufficient guards had been posted, modestly departed to the
      houses which were allotted for their reception. Belisarius fixed
      his residence in the palace; seated himself on the throne of
      Genseric; accepted and distributed the Barbaric spoil; granted
      their lives to the suppliant Vandals; and labored to repair the
      damage which the suburb of Mandracium had sustained in the
      preceding night. At supper he entertained his principal officers
      with the form and magnificence of a royal banquet. 20 The victor
      was respectfully served by the captive officers of the household;
      and in the moments of festivity, when the impartial spectators
      applauded the fortune and merit of Belisarius, his envious
      flatterers secretly shed their venom on every word and gesture
      which might alarm the suspicions of a jealous monarch. One day
      was given to these pompous scenes, which may not be despised as
      useless, if they attracted the popular veneration; but the active
      mind of Belisarius, which in the pride of victory could suppose a
      defeat, had already resolved that the Roman empire in Africa
      should not depend on the chance of arms, or the favor of the
      people. The fortifications of Carthage 2011 had alone been
      exempted from the general proscription; but in the reign of
      ninety-five years they were suffered to decay by the thoughtless
      and indolent Vandals. A wiser conqueror restored, with incredible
      despatch, the walls and ditches of the city. His liberality
      encouraged the workmen; the soldiers, the mariners, and the
      citizens, vied with each other in the salutary labor; and
      Gelimer, who had feared to trust his person in an open town,
      beheld with astonishment and despair, the rising strength of an
      impregnable fortress.

      That unfortunate monarch, after the loss of his capital, applied
      himself to collect the remains of an army scattered, rather than
      destroyed, by the preceding battle; and the hopes of pillage
      attracted some Moorish bands to the standard of Gelimer. He
      encamped in the fields of Bulla, four days’ journey from
      Carthage; insulted the capital, which he deprived of the use of
      an aqueduct; proposed a high reward for the head of every Roman;
      affected to spare the persons and property of his African
      subjects, and secretly negotiated with the Arian sectaries and
      the confederate Huns. Under these circumstances, the conquest of
      Sardinia served only to aggravate his distress: he reflected,
      with the deepest anguish, that he had wasted, in that useless
      enterprise, five thousand of his bravest troops; and he read,
      with grief and shame, the victorious letters of his brother Zano,
      2012 who expressed a sanguine confidence that the king, after the
      example of their ancestors, had already chastised the rashness of
      the Roman invader. “Alas! my brother,” replied Gelimer, “Heaven
      has declared against our unhappy nation. While you have subdued
      Sardinia, we have lost Africa. No sooner did Belisarius appear
      with a handful of soldiers, than courage and prosperity deserted
      the cause of the Vandals. Your nephew Gibamund, your brother
      Ammatas, have been betrayed to death by the cowardice of their
      followers. Our horses, our ships, Carthage itself, and all
      Africa, are in the power of the enemy. Yet the Vandals still
      prefer an ignominious repose, at the expense of their wives and
      children, their wealth and liberty. Nothing now remains, except
      the fields of Bulla, and the hope of your valor. Abandon
      Sardinia; fly to our relief; restore our empire, or perish by our
      side.” On the receipt of this epistle, Zano imparted his grief to
      the principal Vandals; but the intelligence was prudently
      concealed from the natives of the island. The troops embarked in
      one hundred and twenty galleys at the port of Caghari, cast
      anchor the third day on the confines of Mauritania, and hastily
      pursued their march to join the royal standard in the camp of
      Bulla. Mournful was the interview: the two brothers embraced;
      they wept in silence; no questions were asked of the Sardinian
      victory; no inquiries were made of the African misfortunes: they
      saw before their eyes the whole extent of their calamities; and
      the absence of their wives and children afforded a melancholy
      proof that either death or captivity had been their lot. The
      languid spirit of the Vandals was at length awakened and united
      by the entreaties of their king, the example of Zano, and the
      instant danger which threatened their monarchy and religion. The
      military strength of the nation advanced to battle; and such was
      the rapid increase, that before their army reached Tricameron,
      about twenty miles from Carthage, they might boast, perhaps with
      some exaggeration, that they surpassed, in a tenfold proportion,
      the diminutive powers of the Romans. But these powers were under
      the command of Belisarius; and, as he was conscious of their
      superior merit, he permitted the Barbarians to surprise him at an
      unseasonable hour. The Romans were instantly under arms; a
      rivulet covered their front; the cavalry formed the first line,
      which Belisarius supported in the centre, at the head of five
      hundred guards; the infantry, at some distance, was posted in the
      second line; and the vigilance of the general watched the
      separate station and ambiguous faith of the Massagetae, who
      secretly reserved their aid for the conquerors. The historian has
      inserted, and the reader may easily supply, the speeches 21 of
      the commanders, who, by arguments the most apposite to their
      situation, inculcated the importance of victory, and the contempt
      of life. Zano, with the troops which had followed him to the
      conquest of Sardinia, was placed in the centre; and the throne of
      Genseric might have stood, if the multitude of Vandals had
      imitated their intrepid resolution. Casting away their lances and
      missile weapons, they drew their swords, and expected the charge:
      the Roman cavalry thrice passed the rivulet; they were thrice
      repulsed; and the conflict was firmly maintained, till Zano fell,
      and the standard of Belisarius was displayed. Gelimer retreated
      to his camp; the Huns joined the pursuit; and the victors
      despoiled the bodies of the slain. Yet no more than fifty Romans,
      and eight hundred Vandals were found on the field of battle; so
      inconsiderable was the carnage of a day, which extinguished a
      nation, and transferred the empire of Africa. In the evening
      Belisarius led his infantry to the attack of the camp; and the
      pusillanimous flight of Gelimer exposed the vanity of his recent
      declarations, that to the vanquished, death was a relief, life a
      burden, and infamy the only object of terror. His departure was
      secret; but as soon as the Vandals discovered that their king had
      deserted them, they hastily dispersed, anxious only for their
      personal safety, and careless of every object that is dear or
      valuable to mankind. The Romans entered the camp without
      resistance; and the wildest scenes of disorder were veiled in the
      darkness and confusion of the night. Every Barbarian who met
      their swords was inhumanly massacred; their widows and daughters,
      as rich heirs, or beautiful concubines, were embraced by the
      licentious soldiers; and avarice itself was almost satiated with
      the treasures of gold and silver, the accumulated fruits of
      conquest or economy in a long period of prosperity and peace. In
      this frantic search, the troops, even of Belisarius, forgot their
      caution and respect. Intoxicated with lust and rapine, they
      explored, in small parties, or alone, the adjacent fields, the
      woods, the rocks, and the caverns, that might possibly conceal
      any desirable prize: laden with booty, they deserted their ranks,
      and wandered without a guide, on the high road to Carthage; and
      if the flying enemies had dared to return, very few of the
      conquerors would have escaped. Deeply sensible of the disgrace
      and danger, Belisarius passed an apprehensive night on the field
      of victory: at the dawn of day, he planted his standard on a
      hill, recalled his guardians and veterans, and gradually restored
      the modesty and obedience of the camp. It was equally the concern
      of the Roman general to subdue the hostile, and to save the
      prostrate, Barbarian; and the suppliant Vandals, who could be
      found only in churches, were protected by his authority,
      disarmed, and separately confined, that they might neither
      disturb the public peace, nor become the victims of popular
      revenge. After despatching a light detachment to tread the
      footsteps of Gelimer, he advanced, with his whole army, about ten
      days’ march, as far as Hippo Regius, which no longer possessed
      the relics of St. Augustin. 22 The season, and the certain
      intelligence that the Vandal had fled to an inaccessible country
      of the Moors, determined Belisarius to relinquish the vain
      pursuit, and to fix his winter quarters at Carthage. From thence
      he despatched his principal lieutenant, to inform the emperor,
      that in the space of three months he had achieved the conquest of
      Africa.

      22 (return) [ The relics of St. Augustin were carried by the
      African bishops to their Sardinian exile, (A.D. 500;) and it was
      believed, in the viiith century, that Liutprand, king of the
      Lombards, transported them (A.D. 721) from Sardinia to Pavia. In
      the year 1695, the Augustan friars of that city found a brick
      arch, marble coffin, silver case, silk wrapper, bones, blood,
      &c., and perhaps an inscription of Agostino in Gothic letters.
      But this useful discovery has been disputed by reason and
      jealousy, (Baronius, Annal. A.D. 725, No. 2-9. Tillemont, Mem.
      Eccles. tom. xiii. p. 944. Montfaucon, Diarium Ital. p. 26-30.

      who had composed a separate treatise before the decree of the
      bishop of Pavia, and Pope Benedict XIII.)]

      Belisarius spoke the language of truth. The surviving Vandals
      yielded, without resistance, their arms and their freedom; the
      neighborhood of Carthage submitted to his presence; and the more
      distant provinces were successively subdued by the report of his
      victory. Tripoli was confirmed in her voluntary allegiance;
      Sardinia and Corsica surrendered to an officer, who carried,
      instead of a sword, the head of the valiant Zano; and the Isles
      of Majorca, Minorca, and Yvica consented to remain an humble
      appendage of the African kingdom. Caesarea, a royal city, which
      in looser geography may be confounded with the modern Algiers,
      was situate thirty days’ march to the westward of Carthage: by
      land, the road was infested by the Moors; but the sea was open,
      and the Romans were now masters of the sea. An active and
      discreet tribune sailed as far as the Straits, where he occupied
      Septem or Ceuta, 23 which rises opposite to Gibraltar on the
      African coast; that remote place was afterwards adorned and
      fortified by Justinian; and he seems to have indulged the vain
      ambition of extending his empire to the columns of Hercules. He
      received the messengers of victory at the time when he was
      preparing to publish the Pandects of the Roman laws; and the
      devout or jealous emperor celebrated the divine goodness, and
      confessed, in silence, the merit of his successful general. 24
      Impatient to abolish the temporal and spiritual tyranny of the
      Vandals, he proceeded, without delay, to the full establishment
      of the Catholic church. Her jurisdiction, wealth, and immunites,
      perhaps the most essential part of episcopal religion, were
      restored and amplified with a liberal hand; the Arian worship was
      suppressed; the Donatist meetings were proscribed; 25 and the
      synod of Carthage, by the voice of two hundred and seventeen
      bishops, 26 applauded the just measure of pious retaliation. On
      such an occasion, it may not be presumed, that many orthodox
      prelates were absent; but the comparative smallness of their
      number, which in ancient councils had been twice or even thrice
      multiplied, most clearly indicates the decay both of the church
      and state. While Justinian approved himself the defender of the
      faith, he entertained an ambitious hope, that his victorious
      lieutenant would speedily enlarge the narrow limits of his
      dominion to the space which they occupied before the invasion of
      the Moors and Vandals; and Belisarius was instructed to establish
      five dukes or commanders in the convenient stations of Tripoli,
      Leptis, Cirta, Caesarea, and Sardinia, and to compute the
      military force of palatines or borderers that might be sufficient
      for the defence of Africa. The kingdom of the Vandals was not
      unworthy of the presence of a Praetorian praefect; and four
      consulars, three presidents, were appointed to administer the
      seven provinces under his civil jurisdiction. The number of their
      subordinate officers, clerks, messengers, or assistants, was
      minutely expressed; three hundred and ninety-six for the praefect
      himself, fifty for each of his vicegerents; and the rigid
      definition of their fees and salaries was more effectual to
      confirm the right than to prevent the abuse. These magistrates
      might be oppressive, but they were not idle; and the subtile
      questions of justice and revenue were infinitely propagated under
      the new government, which professed to revive the freedom and
      equity of the Roman republic. The conqueror was solicitous to
      extract a prompt and plentiful supply from his African subjects;
      and he allowed them to claim, even in the third degree, and from
      the collateral line, the houses and lands of which their families
      had been unjustly despoiled by the Vandals. After the departure
      of Belisarius, who acted by a high and special commission, no
      ordinary provision was made for a master-general of the forces;
      but the office of Praetorian praefect was intrusted to a soldier;
      the civil and military powers were united, according to the
      practice of Justinian, in the chief governor; and the
      representative of the emperor in Africa, as well as in Italy, was
      soon distinguished by the appellation of Exarch. 27

      Yet the conquest of Africa was imperfect till her former
      sovereign was delivered, either alive or dead, into the hands of
      the Romans. Doubtful of the event, Gelimer had given secret
      orders that a part of his treasure should be transported to
      Spain, where he hoped to find a secure refuge at the court of the
      king of the Visigoths. But these intentions were disappointed by
      accident, treachery, and the indefatigable pursuit of his
      enemies, who intercepted his flight from the sea-shore, and
      chased the unfortunate monarch, with some faithful followers, to
      the inaccessible mountain of Papua, 28 in the inland country of
      Numidia. He was immediately besieged by Pharas, an officer whose
      truth and sobriety were the more applauded, as such qualities
      could seldom be found among the Heruli, the most corrupt of the
      Barbarian tribes. To his vigilance Belisarius had intrusted this
      important charge and, after a bold attempt to scale the mountain,
      in which he lost a hundred and ten soldiers, Pharas expected,
      during a winter siege, the operation of distress and famine on
      the mind of the Vandal king. From the softest habits of pleasure,
      from the unbounded command of industry and wealth, he was reduced
      to share the poverty of the Moors, 29 supportable only to
      themselves by their ignorance of a happier condition. In their
      rude hovels, of mud and hurdles, which confined the smoke and
      excluded the light, they promiscuously slept on the ground,
      perhaps on a sheep-skin, with their wives, their children, and
      their cattle. Sordid and scanty were their garments; the use of
      bread and wine was unknown; and their oaten or barley cakes,
      imperfectly baked in the ashes, were devoured almost in a crude
      state, by the hungry savages. The health of Gelimer must have
      sunk under these strange and unwonted hardships, from whatsoever
      cause they had been endured; but his actual misery was imbittered
      by the recollection of past greatness, the daily insolence of his
      protectors, and the just apprehension, that the light and venal
      Moors might be tempted to betray the rights of hospitality. The
      knowledge of his situation dictated the humane and friendly
      epistle of Pharas. “Like yourself,” said the chief of the Heruli,
      “I am an illiterate Barbarian, but I speak the language of plain
      sense and an honest heart. Why will you persist in hopeless
      obstinacy? Why will you ruin yourself, your family, and nation?
      The love of freedom and abhorrence of slavery? Alas! my dearest
      Gelimer, are you not already the worst of slaves, the slave of
      the vile nation of the Moors? Would it not be preferable to
      sustain at Constantinople a life of poverty and servitude, rather
      than to reign the undoubted monarch of the mountain of Papua? Do
      you think it a disgrace to be the subject of Justinian?
      Belisarius is his subject; and we ourselves, whose birth is not
      inferior to your own, are not ashamed of our obedience to the
      Roman emperor. That generous prince will grant you a rich
      inheritance of lands, a place in the senate, and the dignity of
      patrician: such are his gracious intentions, and you may depend
      with full assurance on the word of Belisarius. So long as Heaven
      has condemned us to suffer, patience is a virtue; but if we
      reject the proffered deliverance, it degenerates into blind and
      stupid despair.” “I am not insensible” replied the king of the
      Vandals, “how kind and rational is your advice. But I cannot
      persuade myself to become the slave of an unjust enemy, who has
      deserved my implacable hatred. Him I had never injured either by
      word or deed: yet he has sent against me, I know not from whence,
      a certain Belisarius, who has cast me headlong from the throne
      into his abyss of misery. Justinian is a man; he is a prince;
      does he not dread for himself a similar reverse of fortune? I can
      write no more: my grief oppresses me. Send me, I beseech you, my
      dear Pharas, send me, a lyre, 30 a sponge, and a loaf of bread.”
      From the Vandal messenger, Pharas was informed of the motives of
      this singular request. It was long since the king of Africa had
      tasted bread; a defluxion had fallen on his eyes, the effect of
      fatigue or incessant weeping; and he wished to solace the
      melancholy hours, by singing to the lyre the sad story of his own
      misfortunes. The humanity of Pharas was moved; he sent the three
      extraordinary gifts; but even his humanity prompted him to
      redouble the vigilance of his guard, that he might sooner compel
      his prisoner to embrace a resolution advantageous to the Romans,
      but salutary to himself. The obstinacy of Gelimer at length
      yielded to reason and necessity; the solemn assurances of safety
      and honorable treatment were ratified in the emperor’s name, by
      the ambassador of Belisarius; and the king of the Vandals
      descended from the mountain. The first public interview was in
      one of the suburbs of Carthage; and when the royal captive
      accosted his conqueror, he burst into a fit of laughter. The
      crowd might naturally believe, that extreme grief had deprived
      Gelimer of his senses: but in this mournful state, unseasonable
      mirth insinuated to more intelligent observers, that the vain and
      transitory scenes of human greatness are unworthy of a serious
      thought. 31

      of grief in another royal captive, Psammetichus of Egypt, who
      wept at the lesser and was silent at the greatest of his
      calamities, (l. iii. c. 14.) In the interview of Paulus Aemilius
      and Perses, Belisarius might study his part; but it is probable
      that he never read either Livy or Plutarch; and it is certain
      that his generosity did not need a tutor.]

      Their contempt was soon justified by a new example of a vulgar
      truth; that flattery adheres to power, and envy to superior
      merit. The chiefs of the Roman army presumed to think themselves
      the rivals of a hero. Their private despatches maliciously
      affirmed, that the conqueror of Africa, strong in his reputation
      and the public love, conspired to seat himself on the throne of
      the Vandals. Justinian listened with too patient an ear; and his
      silence was the result of jealousy rather than of confidence. An
      honorable alternative, of remaining in the province, or of
      returning to the capital, was indeed submitted to the discretion
      of Belisarius; but he wisely concluded, from intercepted letters
      and the knowledge of his sovereign’s temper, that he must either
      resign his head, erect his standard, or confound his enemies by
      his presence and submission. Innocence and courage decided his
      choice; his guards, captives, and treasures, were diligently
      embarked; and so prosperous was the navigation, that his arrival
      at Constantinople preceded any certain account of his departure
      from the port of Carthage. Such unsuspecting loyalty removed the
      apprehensions of Justinian; envy was silenced and inflamed by the
      public gratitude; and the third Africanus obtained the honors of
      a triumph, a ceremony which the city of Constantine had never
      seen, and which ancient Rome, since the reign of Tiberius, had
      reserved for the auspicious arms of the Caesars. From the palace
      of Belisarius, the procession was conducted through the principal
      streets to the hippodrome; and this memorable day seemed to
      avenge the injuries of Genseric, and to expiate the shame of the
      Romans. The wealth of nations was displayed, the trophies of
      martial or effeminate luxury; rich armor, golden thrones, and the
      chariots of state which had been used by the Vandal queen; the
      massy furniture of the royal banquet, the splendor of precious
      stones, the elegant forms of statues and vases, the more
      substantial treasure of gold, and the holy vessels of the Jewish
      temple, which after their long peregrination were respectfully
      deposited in the Christian church of Jerusalem. A long train of
      the noblest Vandals reluctantly exposed their lofty stature and
      manly countenance. Gelimer slowly advanced: he was clad in a
      purple robe, and still maintained the majesty of a king. Not a
      tear escaped from his eyes, not a sigh was heard; but his pride
      or piety derived some secret consolation from the words of
      Solomon, 33 which he repeatedly pronounced, Vanity! vanity! all
      is vanity! Instead of ascending a triumphal car drawn by four
      horses or elephants, the modest conqueror marched on foot at the
      head of his brave companions; his prudence might decline an honor
      too conspicuous for a subject; and his magnanimity might justly
      disdain what had been so often sullied by the vilest of tyrants.
      The glorious procession entered the gate of the hippodrome; was
      saluted by the acclamations of the senate and people; and halted
      before the throne where Justinian and Theodora were seated to
      receive homage of the captive monarch and the victorious hero.
      They both performed the customary adoration; and falling
      prostrate on the ground, respectfully touched the footstool of a
      prince who had not unsheathed his sword, and of a prostitute who
      had danced on the theatre; some gentle violence was used to bend
      the stubborn spirit of the grandson of Genseric; and however
      trained to servitude, the genius of Belisarius must have secretly
      rebelled. He was immediately declared consul for the ensuing
      year, and the day of his inauguration resembled the pomp of a
      second triumph: his curule chair was borne aloft on the shoulders
      of captive Vandals; and the spoils of war, gold cups, and rich
      girdles, were profusely scattered among the populace. [Footnote
      32: After the title of imperator had lost the old military sense,
      and the Roman auspices were abolished by Christianity, (see La
      Bleterie, Mem. de l’Academie, tom. xxi. p. 302—332,) a triumph
      might be given with less inconsistency to a private general.]

      experience than seem to belong either to a Jew or a king. * Note:

      Chapter XLI: Conquests Of Justinian, Charact Of Balisarius.—Part
      III.

      Although Theodatus descended from a race of heroes, he was
      ignorant of the art, and averse to the dangers, of war. Although
      he had studied the writings of Plato and Tully, philosophy was
      incapable of purifying his mind from the basest passions, avarice
      and fear. He had purchased a sceptre by ingratitude and murder:
      at the first menace of an enemy, he degraded his own majesty and
      that of a nation, which already disdained their unworthy
      sovereign. Astonished by the recent example of Gelimer, he saw
      himself dragged in chains through the streets of Constantinople:
      the terrors which Belisarius inspired were heightened by the
      eloquence of Peter, the Byzantine ambassador; and that bold and
      subtle advocate persuaded him to sign a treaty, too ignominious
      to become the foundation of a lasting peace. It was stipulated,
      that in the acclamations of the Roman people, the name of the
      emperor should be always proclaimed before that of the Gothic
      king; and that as often as the statue of Theodatus was erected in
      brass on marble, the divine image of Justinian should be placed
      on its right hand. Instead of conferring, the king of Italy was
      reduced to solicit, the honors of the senate; and the consent of
      the emperor was made indispensable before he could execute,
      against a priest or senator, the sentence either of death or
      confiscation. The feeble monarch resigned the possession of
      Sicily; offered, as the annual mark of his dependence, a crown of
      gold of the weight of three hundred pounds; and promised to
      supply, at the requisition of his sovereign, three thousand
      Gothic auxiliaries, for the service of the empire. Satisfied with
      these extraordinary concessions, the successful agent of
      Justinian hastened his journey to Constantinople; but no sooner
      had he reached the Alban villa, 60 than he was recalled by the
      anxiety of Theodatus; and the dialogue which passed between the
      king and the ambassador deserves to be represented in its
      original simplicity. “Are you of opinion that the emperor will
      ratify this treaty? Perhaps. If he refuses, what consequence will
      ensue? War. Will such a war, be just or reasonable? Most
      assuredly: every to his character. What is your meaning? You are
      a philosopher—Justinian is emperor of the Romans: it would all
      become the disciple of Plato to shed the blood of thousands in
      his private quarrel: the successor of Augustus should vindicate
      his rights, and recover by arms the ancient provinces of his
      empire.” This reasoning might not convince, but it was sufficient
      to alarm and subdue the weakness of Theodatus; and he soon
      descended to his last offer, that for the poor equivalent of a
      pension of forty-eight thousand pounds sterling, he would resign
      the kingdom of the Goths and Italians, and spend the remainder of
      his days in the innocent pleasures of philosophy and agriculture.

      Both treaties were intrusted to the hands of the ambassador, on
      the frail security of an oath not to produce the second till the
      first had been positively rejected. The event may be easily
      foreseen: Justinian required and accepted the abdication of the
      Gothic king. His indefatigable agent returned from Constantinople
      to Ravenna, with ample instructions; and a fair epistle, which
      praised the wisdom and generosity of the royal philosopher,
      granted his pension, with the assurance of such honors as a
      subject and a Catholic might enjoy; and wisely referred the final
      execution of the treaty to the presence and authority of
      Belisarius. But in the interval of suspense, two Roman generals,
      who had entered the province of Dalmatia, were defeated and slain
      by the Gothic troops. From blind and abject despair, Theodatus
      capriciously rose to groundless and fatal presumption, 61 and
      dared to receive, with menace and contempt, the ambassador of
      Justinian; who claimed his promise, solicited the allegiance of
      his subjects, and boldly asserted the inviolable privilege of his
      own character. The march of Belisarius dispelled this visionary
      pride; and as the first campaign 62 was employed in the reduction
      of Sicily, the invasion of Italy is applied by Procopius to the
      second year of the Gothic war. 63

      the captivity of Vitigas. With the aid of Sigonius (Opp. tom. i.
      de Imp. Occident. l. xvii. xviii.) and Muratori, (Annali d’Itaia,
      tom. v.,) I have gleaned some few additional facts.]

      After Belisarius had left sufficient garrisons in Palermo and
      Syracuse, he embarked his troops at Messina, and landed them,
      without resistance, on the opposite shores of Rhegium. A Gothic
      prince, who had married the daughter of Theodatus, was stationed
      with an army to guard the entrance of Italy; but he imitated,
      without scruple, the example of a sovereign faithless to his
      public and private duties. The perfidious Ebermor deserted with
      his followers to the Roman camp, and was dismissed to enjoy the
      servile honors of the Byzantine court. 64 From Rhegium to Naples,
      the fleet and army of Belisarius, almost always in view of each
      other, advanced near three hundred miles along the sea-coast. The
      people of Bruttium, Lucania, and Campania, who abhorred the name
      and religion of the Goths, embraced the specious excuse, that
      their ruined walls were incapable of defence: the soldiers paid a
      just equivalent for a plentiful market; and curiosity alone
      interrupted the peaceful occupations of the husbandman or
      artificer. Naples, which has swelled to a great and populous
      capital, long cherished the language and manners of a Grecian
      colony; 65 and the choice of Virgil had ennobled this elegant
      retreat, which attracted the lovers of repose and study, elegant
      retreat, which attracted the lovers of repose and study, from the
      noise, the smoke, and the laborious opulence of Rome. 66 As soon
      as the place was invested by sea and land, Belisarius gave
      audience to the deputies of the people, who exhorted him to
      disregard a conquest unworthy of his arms, to seek the Gothic
      king in a field of battle, and, after his victory, to claim, as
      the sovereign of Rome, the allegiance of the dependent cities.
      “When I treat with my enemies,” replied the Roman chief, with a
      haughty smile, “I am more accustomed to give than to receive
      counsel; but I hold in one hand inevitable ruin, and in the other
      peace and freedom, such as Sicily now enjoys.” The impatience of
      delay urged him to grant the most liberal terms; his honor
      secured their performance: but Naples was divided into two
      factions; and the Greek democracy was inflamed by their orators,
      who, with much spirit and some truth, represented to the
      multitude that the Goths would punish their defection, and that
      Belisarius himself must esteem their loyalty and valor. Their
      deliberations, however, were not perfectly free: the city was
      commanded by eight hundred Barbarians, whose wives and children
      were detained at Ravenna as the pledge of their fidelity; and
      even the Jews, who were rich and numerous, resisted, with
      desperate enthusiasm, the intolerant laws of Justinian. In a much
      later period, the circumference of Naples 67 measured only two
      thousand three hundred and sixty three paces: 68 the
      fortifications were defended by precipices or the sea; when the
      aqueducts were intercepted, a supply of water might be drawn from
      wells and fountains; and the stock of provisions was sufficient
      to consume the patience of the besiegers. At the end of twenty
      days, that of Belisarius was almost exhausted, and he had
      reconciled himself to the disgrace of abandoning the siege, that
      he might march, before the winter season, against Rome and the
      Gothic king. But his anxiety was relieved by the bold curiosity
      of an Isaurian, who explored the dry channel of an aqueduct, and
      secretly reported, that a passage might be perforated to
      introduce a file of armed soldiers into the heart of the city.
      When the work had been silently executed, the humane general
      risked the discovery of his secret by a last and fruitless
      admonition of the impending danger. In the darkness of the night,
      four hundred Romans entered the aqueduct, raised themselves by a
      rope, which they fastened to an olive-tree, into the house or
      garden of a solitary matron, sounded their trumpets, surprised
      the sentinels, and gave admittance to their companions, who on
      all sides scaled the walls, and burst open the gates of the city.
      Every crime which is punished by social justice was practised as
      the rights of war; the Huns were distinguished by cruelty and
      sacrilege, and Belisarius alone appeared in the streets and
      churches of Naples to moderate the calamities which he predicted.
      “The gold and silver,” he repeatedly exclaimed, “are the just
      rewards of your valor. But spare the inhabitants; they are
      Christians, they are suppliants, they are now your
      fellow-subjects. Restore the children to their parents, the wives
      to their husbands; and show them by your generosity of what
      friends they have obstinately deprived themselves.” The city was
      saved by the virtue and authority of its conqueror; 69 and when
      the Neapolitans returned to their houses, they found some
      consolation in the secret enjoyment of their hidden treasures.
      The Barbarian garrison enlisted in the service of the emperor;
      Apulia and Calabria, delivered from the odious presence of the
      Goths, acknowledged his dominion; and the tusks of the Calydonian
      boar, which were still shown at Beneventum, are curiously
      described by the historian of Belisarius. 70

      The faithful soldiers and citizens of Naples had expected their
      deliverance from a prince, who remained the inactive and almost
      indifferent spectator of their ruin. Theodatus secured his person
      within the walls of Rome, whilst his cavalry advanced forty miles
      on the Appian way, and encamped in the Pomptine marshes; which,
      by a canal of nineteen miles in length, had been recently drained
      and converted into excellent pastures. 71 But the principal
      forces of the Goths were dispersed in Dalmatia, Venetia, and
      Gaul; and the feeble mind of their king was confounded by the
      unsuccessful event of a divination, which seemed to presage the
      downfall of his empire. 72 The most abject slaves have arraigned
      the guilt or weakness of an unfortunate master. The character of
      Theodatus was rigorously scrutinized by a free and idle camp of
      Barbarians, conscious of their privilege and power: he was
      declared unworthy of his race, his nation, and his throne; and
      their general Vitiges, whose valor had been signalized in the
      Illyrian war, was raised with unanimous applause on the bucklers
      of his companions. On the first rumor, the abdicated monarch fled
      from the justice of his country; but he was pursued by private
      revenge. A Goth, whom he had injured in his love, overtook
      Theodatus on the Flaminian way, and, regardless of his unmanly
      cries, slaughtered him, as he lay, prostrate on the ground, like
      a victim (says the historian) at the foot of the altar. The
      choice of the people is the best and purest title to reign over
      them; yet such is the prejudice of every age, that Vitiges
      impatiently wished to return to Ravenna, where he might seize,
      with the reluctant hand of the daughter of Amalasontha, some
      faint shadow of hereditary right. A national council was
      immediately held, and the new monarch reconciled the impatient
      spirit of the Barbarians to a measure of disgrace, which the
      misconduct of his predecessor rendered wise and indispensable.
      The Goths consented to retreat in the presence of a victorious
      enemy; to delay till the next spring the operations of offensive
      war; to summon their scattered forces; to relinquish their
      distant possessions, and to trust even Rome itself to the faith
      of its inhabitants. Leuderis, an ancient warrior, was left in the
      capital with four thousand soldiers; a feeble garrison, which
      might have seconded the zeal, though it was incapable of opposing
      the wishes, of the Romans. But a momentary enthusiasm of religion
      and patriotism was kindled in their minds. They furiously
      exclaimed, that the apostolic throne should no longer be profaned
      by the triumph or toleration of Arianism; that the tombs of the
      Caesars should no longer be trampled by the savages of the North;
      and, without reflecting, that Italy must sink into a province of
      Constantinople, they fondly hailed the restoration of a Roman
      emperor as a new aera of freedom and prosperity. The deputies of
      the pope and clergy, of the senate and people, invited the
      lieutenant of Justinian to accept their voluntary allegiance, and
      to enter the city, whose gates would be thrown open for his
      reception. As soon as Belisarius had fortified his new conquests,
      Naples and Cumae, he advanced about twenty miles to the banks of
      the Vulturnus, contemplated the decayed grandeur of Capua, and
      halted at the separation of the Latin and Appian ways. The work
      of the censor, after the incessant use of nine centuries, still
      preserved its primaeval beauty, and not a flaw could be
      discovered in the large polished stones, of which that solid,
      though narrow road, was so firmly compacted. 73 Belisarius,
      however, preferred the Latin way, which, at a distance from the
      sea and the marshes, skirted in a space of one hundred and twenty
      miles along the foot of the mountains. His enemies had
      disappeared: when he made his entrance through the Asinarian
      gate, the garrison departed without molestation along the
      Flaminian way; and the city, after sixty years’ servitude, was
      delivered from the yoke of the Barbarians. Leuderis alone, from a
      motive of pride or discontent, refused to accompany the
      fugitives; and the Gothic chief, himself a trophy of the victory,
      was sent with the keys of Rome to the throne of the emperor
      Justinian. 74

      The first days, which coincided with the old Saturnalia, were
      devoted to mutual congratulation and the public joy; and the
      Catholics prepared to celebrate, without a rival, the approaching
      festival of the nativity of Christ. In the familiar conversation
      of a hero, the Romans acquired some notion of the virtues which
      history ascribed to their ancestors; they were edified by the
      apparent respect of Belisarius for the successor of St. Peter,
      and his rigid discipline secured in the midst of war the
      blessings of tranquillity and justice. They applauded the rapid
      success of his arms, which overran the adjacent country, as far
      as Narni, Perusia, and Spoleto; but they trembled, the senate,
      the clergy, and the unwarlike people, as soon as they understood
      that he had resolved, and would speedily be reduced, to sustain a
      siege against the powers of the Gothic monarchy. The designs of
      Vitiges were executed, during the winter season, with diligence
      and effect. From their rustic habitations, from their distant
      garrisons, the Goths assembled at Ravenna for the defence of
      their country; and such were their numbers, that, after an army
      had been detached for the relief of Dalmatia, one hundred and
      fifty thousand fighting men marched under the royal standard.
      According to the degrees of rank or merit, the Gothic king
      distributed arms and horses, rich gifts, and liberal promises; he
      moved along the Flaminian way, declined the useless sieges of
      Perusia and Spoleto, respected he impregnable rock of Narni, and
      arrived within two miles of Rome at the foot of the Milvian
      bridge. The narrow passage was fortified with a tower, and
      Belisarius had computed the value of the twenty days which must
      be lost in the construction of another bridge. But the
      consternation of the soldiers of the tower, who either fled or
      deserted, disappointed his hopes, and betrayed his person into
      the most imminent danger. At the head of one thousand horse, the
      Roman general sallied from the Flaminian gate to mark the ground
      of an advantageous position, and to survey the camp of the
      Barbarians; but while he still believed them on the other side of
      the Tyber, he was suddenly encompassed and assaulted by their
      numerous squadrons. The fate of Italy depended on his life; and
      the deserters pointed to the conspicuous horse a bay, 75 with a
      white face, which he rode on that memorable day. “Aim at the bay
      horse,” was the universal cry. Every bow was bent, every javelin
      was directed, against that fatal object, and the command was
      repeated and obeyed by thousands who were ignorant of its real
      motive. The bolder Barbarians advanced to the more honorable
      combat of swords and spears; and the praise of an enemy has
      graced the fall of Visandus, the standard-bearer, 76 who
      maintained his foremost station, till he was pierced with
      thirteen wounds, perhaps by the hand of Belisarius himself. The
      Roman general was strong, active, and dexterous; on every side he
      discharged his weighty and mortal strokes: his faithful guards
      imitated his valor, and defended his person; and the Goths, after
      the loss of a thousand men, fled before the arms of a hero. They
      were rashly pursued to their camp; and the Romans, oppressed by
      multitudes, made a gradual, and at length a precipitate retreat
      to the gates of the city: the gates were shut against the
      fugitives; and the public terror was increased, by the report
      that Belisarius was slain. His countenance was indeed disfigured
      by sweat, dust, and blood; his voice was hoarse, his strength was
      almost exhausted; but his unconquerable spirit still remained; he
      imparted that spirit to his desponding companions; and their last
      desperate charge was felt by the flying Barbarians, as if a new
      army, vigorous and entire, had been poured from the city. The
      Flaminian gate was thrown open to a real triumph; but it was not
      before Belisarius had visited every post, and provided for the
      public safety, that he could be persuaded, by his wife and
      friends, to taste the needful refreshments of food and sleep. In
      the more improved state of the art of war, a general is seldom
      required, or even permitted to display the personal prowess of a
      soldier; and the example of Belisarius may be added to the rare
      examples of Henry IV., of Pyrrhus, and of Alexander.

      75 (return) [ A horse of a bay or red color was styled by the
      Greeks, balan by the Barbarians, and spadix by the Romans.

      Observations of Martin and Heyne.) It signifies a branch of the
      palm-tree, whose name is synonymous to red, (Aulus Gellius, ii.
      26.)]

      76 (return) [ I interpret it, not as a proper, name, but an
      office, standard-bearer, from bandum, (vexillum,) a Barbaric word

      760. Grot. Nomina Hethica, p. 575. Ducange, Gloss. Latin. tom. i.
      p. 539, 540.)]

      After this first and unsuccessful trial of their enemies, the
      whole army of the Goths passed the Tyber, and formed the siege of
      the city, which continued above a year, till their final
      departure. Whatever fancy may conceive, the severe compass of the
      geographer defines the circumference of Rome within a line of
      twelve miles and three hundred and forty-five paces; and that
      circumference, except in the Vatican, has invariably been the
      same from the triumph of Aurelian to the peaceful but obscure
      reign of the modern popes. 77 But in the day of her greatness,
      the space within her walls was crowded with habitations and
      inhabitants; and the populous suburbs, that stretched along the
      public roads, were darted like so many rays from one common
      centre. Adversity swept away these extraneous ornaments, and left
      naked and desolate a considerable part even of the seven hills.
      Yet Rome in its present state could send into the field about
      thirty thousand males of a military age; 78 and, notwithstanding
      the want of discipline and exercise, the far greater part, inured
      to the hardships of poverty, might be capable of bearing arms for
      the defence of their country and religion. The prudence of
      Belisarius did not neglect this important resource. His soldiers
      were relieved by the zeal and diligence of the people, who
      watched while they slept, and labored while they reposed: he
      accepted the voluntary service of the bravest and most indigent
      of the Roman youth; and the companies of townsmen sometimes
      represented, in a vacant post, the presence of the troops which
      had been drawn away to more essential duties. But his just
      confidence was placed in the veterans who had fought under his
      banner in the Persian and African wars; and although that gallant
      band was reduced to five thousand men, he undertook, with such
      contemptible numbers, to defend a circle of twelve miles, against
      an army of one hundred and fifty thousand Barbarians. In the
      walls of Rome, which Belisarius constructed or restored, the
      materials of ancient architecture may be discerned; 79 and the
      whole fortification was completed, except in a chasm still extant
      between the Pincian and Flaminian gates, which the prejudices of
      the Goths and Romans left under the effectual guard of St. Peter
      the apostle. 80

      delineated in 1738 for Rollin’s history. Experience had improved
      his knowledge and instead of Rossi’s topography, he used the new
      and excellent map of Nolli. Pliny’s old measure of thirteen must
      be reduced to eight miles. It is easier to alter a text, than to
      remove hills or buildings. * Note: Compare Gibbon, ch. xi. note

      10,) yet it is equally clear that the historian avers that they
      are all the same.” The present extent, 12 3/4 nearly agrees with
      the second statement of Gibbon. Sir. J. Hobhouse also observes
      that the walls were enlarged by Constantine; but there can be no

      The battlements or bastions were shaped in sharp angles; a ditch,
      broad and deep, protected the foot of the rampart; and the
      archers on the rampart were assisted by military engines; the
      balistri, a powerful cross-bow, which darted short but massy
      arrows; the onagri, or wild asses, which, on the principle of a
      sling, threw stones and bullets of an enormous size. 81 A chain
      was drawn across the Tyber; the arches of the aqueducts were made
      impervious, and the mole or sepulchre of Hadrian 82 was
      converted, for the first time, to the uses of a citadel. That
      venerable structure, which contained the ashes of the Antonines,
      was a circular turret rising from a quadrangular basis; it was
      covered with the white marble of Paros, and decorated by the
      statues of gods and heroes; and the lover of the arts must read
      with a sigh, that the works of Praxiteles or Lysippus were torn
      from their lofty pedestals, and hurled into the ditch on the
      heads of the besiegers. 83 To each of his lieutenants Belisarius
      assigned the defence of a gate, with the wise and peremptory
      instruction, that, whatever might be the alarm, they should
      steadily adhere to their respective posts, and trust their
      general for the safety of Rome. The formidable host of the Goths
      was insufficient to embrace the ample measure of the city, of the
      fourteen gates, seven only were invested from the Proenestine to
      the Flaminian way; and Vitiges divided his troops into six camps,
      each of which was fortified with a ditch and rampart. On the
      Tuscan side of the river, a seventh encampment was formed in the
      field or circus of the Vatican, for the important purpose of
      commanding the Milvian bridge and the course of the Tyber; but
      they approached with devotion the adjacent church of St. Peter;
      and the threshold of the holy apostles was respected during the
      siege by a Christian enemy. In the ages of victory, as often as
      the senate decreed some distant conquest, the consul denounced
      hostilities, by unbarring, in solemn pomp, the gates of the
      temple of Janus. 84 Domestic war now rendered the admonition
      superfluous, and the ceremony was superseded by the establishment
      of a new religion. But the brazen temple of Janus was left
      standing in the forum; of a size sufficient only to contain the
      statue of the god, five cubits in height, of a human form, but
      with two faces directed to the east and west. The double gates
      were likewise of brass; and a fruitless effort to turn them on
      their rusty hinges revealed the scandalous secret that some
      Romans were still attached to the superstition of their
      ancestors.

      Romulus and Numa, (Nardini, p. 13, 256, 329.) Virgil has
      described the ancient rite like a poet and an antiquarian.]
      Eighteen days were employed by the besiegers, to provide all the
      instruments of attack which antiquity had invented. Fascines were
      prepared to fill the ditches, scaling-ladders to ascend the
      walls. The largest trees of the forest supplied the timbers of
      four battering-rams: their heads were armed with iron; they were
      suspended by ropes, and each of them was worked by the labor of
      fifty men. The lofty wooden turrets moved on wheels or rollers,
      and formed a spacious platform of the level of the rampart. On
      the morning of the nineteenth day, a general attack was made from
      the Praenestine gate to the Vatican: seven Gothic columns, with
      their military engines, advanced to the assault; and the Romans,
      who lined the ramparts, listened with doubt and anxiety to the
      cheerful assurances of their commander. As soon as the enemy
      approached the ditch, Belisarius himself drew the first arrow;
      and such was his strength and dexterity, that he transfixed the
      foremost of the Barbarian leaders.

      A shout of applause and victory was reechoed along the wall. He
      drew a second arrow, and the stroke was followed with the same
      success and the same acclamation. The Roman general then gave the
      word, that the archers should aim at the teams of oxen; they were
      instantly covered with mortal wounds; the towers which they drew
      remained useless and immovable, and a single moment disconcerted
      the laborious projects of the king of the Goths. After this
      disappointment, Vitiges still continued, or feigned to continue,
      the assault of the Salarian gate, that he might divert the
      attention of his adversary, while his principal forces more
      strenuously attacked the Praenestine gate and the sepulchre of
      Hadrian, at the distance of three miles from each other. Near the
      former, the double walls of the Vivarium 85 were low or broken;
      the fortifications of the latter were feebly guarded: the vigor
      of the Goths was excited by the hope of victory and spoil; and if
      a single post had given way, the Romans, and Rome itself, were
      irrecoverably lost. This perilous day was the most glorious in
      the life of Belisarius. Amidst tumult and dismay, the whole plan
      of the attack and defence was distinctly present to his mind; he
      observed the changes of each instant, weighed every possible
      advantage, transported his person to the scenes of danger, and
      communicated his spirit in calm and decisive orders. The contest
      was fiercely maintained from the morning to the evening; the
      Goths were repulsed on all sides; and each Roman might boast that
      he had vanquished thirty Barbarians, if the strange disproportion
      of numbers were not counterbalanced by the merit of one man.
      Thirty thousand Goths, according to the confession of their own
      chiefs, perished in this bloody action; and the multitude of the
      wounded was equal to that of the slain. When they advanced to the
      assault, their close disorder suffered not a javelin to fall
      without effect; and as they retired, the populace of the city
      joined the pursuit, and slaughtered, with impunity, the backs of
      their flying enemies. Belisarius instantly sallied from the
      gates; and while the soldiers chanted his name and victory, the
      hostile engines of war were reduced to ashes. Such was the loss
      and consternation of the Goths, that, from this day, the siege of
      Rome degenerated into a tedious and indolent blockade; and they
      were incessantly harassed by the Roman general, who, in frequent
      skirmishes, destroyed above five thousand of their bravest
      troops. Their cavalry was unpractised in the use of the bow;
      their archers served on foot; and this divided force was
      incapable of contending with their adversaries, whose lances and
      arrows, at a distance, or at hand, were alike formidable. The
      consummate skill of Belisarius embraced the favorable
      opportunities; and as he chose the ground and the moment, as he
      pressed the charge or sounded the retreat, 86 the squadrons which
      he detached were seldom unsuccessful. These partial advantages
      diffused an impatient ardor among the soldiers and people, who
      began to feel the hardships of a siege, and to disregard the
      dangers of a general engagement. Each plebeian conceived himself
      to be a hero, and the infantry, who, since the decay of
      discipline, were rejected from the line of battle, aspired to the
      ancient honors of the Roman legion. Belisarius praised the spirit
      of his troops, condemned their presumption, yielded to their
      clamors, and prepared the remedies of a defeat, the possibility
      of which he alone had courage to suspect. In the quarter of the
      Vatican, the Romans prevailed; and if the irreparable moments had
      not been wasted in the pillage of the camp, they might have
      occupied the Milvian bridge, and charged in the rear of the
      Gothic host. On the other side of the Tyber, Belisarius advanced
      from the Pincian and Salarian gates. But his army, four thousand
      soldiers perhaps, was lost in a spacious plain; they were
      encompassed and oppressed by fresh multitudes, who continually
      relieved the broken ranks of the Barbarians. The valiant leaders
      of the infantry were unskilled to conquer; they died: the retreat
      (a hasty retreat) was covered by the prudence of the general, and
      the victors started back with affright from the formidable aspect
      of an armed rampart. The reputation of Belisarius was unsullied
      by a defeat; and the vain confidence of the Goths was not less
      serviceable to his designs than the repentance and modesty of the
      Roman troops.

      Chapter XLI: Conquests Of Justinian, Charact Of Balisarius.—Part
      IV.

      From the moment that Belisarius had determined to sustain a
      siege, his assiduous care provided Rome against the danger of
      famine, more dreadful than the Gothic arms. An extraordinary
      supply of corn was imported from Sicily: the harvests of Campania
      and Tuscany were forcibly swept for the use of the city; and the
      rights of private property were infringed by the strong plea of
      the public safety. It might easily be foreseen that the enemy
      would intercept the aqueducts; and the cessation of the
      water-mills was the first inconvenience, which was speedily
      removed by mooring large vessels, and fixing mill-stones in the
      current of the river. The stream was soon embarrassed by the
      trunks of trees, and polluted with dead bodies; yet so effectual
      were the precautions of the Roman general, that the waters of the
      Tyber still continued to give motion to the mills and drink to
      the inhabitants: the more distant quarters were supplied from
      domestic wells; and a besieged city might support, without
      impatience, the privation of her public baths. A large portion of
      Rome, from the Praenestine gate to the church of St. Paul, was
      never invested by the Goths; their excursions were restrained by
      the activity of the Moorish troops: the navigation of the Tyber,
      and the Latin, Appian, and Ostian ways, were left free and
      unmolested for the introduction of corn and cattle, or the
      retreat of the inhabitants, who sought refuge in Campania or
      Sicily. Anxious to relieve himself from a useless and devouring
      multitude, Belisarius issued his peremptory orders for the
      instant departure of the women, the children, and slaves;
      required his soldiers to dismiss their male and female
      attendants, and regulated their allowance that one moiety should
      be given in provisions, and the other in money. His foresight was
      justified by the increase of the public distress, as soon as the
      Goths had occupied two important posts in the neighborhood of
      Rome. By the loss of the port, or, as it is now called, the city
      of Porto, he was deprived of the country on the right of the
      Tyber, and the best communication with the sea; and he reflected,
      with grief and anger, that three hundred men, could he have
      spared such a feeble band, might have defended its impregnable
      works. Seven miles from the capital, between the Appian and the
      Latin ways, two principal aqueducts crossing, and again crossing
      each other: enclosed within their solid and lofty arches a
      fortified space, 87 where Vitiges established a camp of seven
      thousand Goths to intercept the convoy of Sicily and Campania.
      The granaries of Rome were insensibly exhausted, the adjacent
      country had been wasted with fire and sword; such scanty supplies
      as might yet be obtained by hasty excursions were the reward of
      valor, and the purchase of wealth: the forage of the horses, and
      the bread of the soldiers, never failed: but in the last months
      of the siege, the people were exposed to the miseries of
      scarcity, unwholesome food, 88 and contagious disorders.
      Belisarius saw and pitied their sufferings; but he had foreseen,
      and he watched the decay of their loyalty, and the progress of
      their discontent. Adversity had awakened the Romans from the
      dreams of grandeur and freedom, and taught them the humiliating
      lesson, that it was of small moment to their real happiness,
      whether the name of their master was derived from the Gothic or
      the Latin language. The lieutenant of Justinian listened to their
      just complaints, but he rejected with disdain the idea of flight
      or capitulation; repressed their clamorous impatience for battle;
      amused them with the prospect of a sure and speedy relief; and
      secured himself and the city from the effects of their despair or
      treachery. Twice in each month he changed the station of the
      officers to whom the custody of the gates was committed: the
      various precautions of patroles, watch words, lights, and music,
      were repeatedly employed to discover whatever passed on the
      ramparts; out-guards were posted beyond the ditch, and the trusty
      vigilance of dogs supplied the more doubtful fidelity of mankind.
      A letter was intercepted, which assured the king of the Goths
      that the Asinarian gate, adjoining to the Lateran church, should
      be secretly opened to his troops. On the proof or suspicion of
      treason, several senators were banished, and the pope Sylverius
      was summoned to attend the representative of his sovereign, at
      his head-quarters in the Pincian palace. 89 The ecclesiastics,
      who followed their bishop, were detained in the first or second
      apartment, 90 and he alone was admitted to the presence of
      Belisarius. The conqueror of Rome and Carthage was modestly
      seated at the feet of Antonina, who reclined on a stately couch:
      the general was silent, but the voice of reproach and menace
      issued from the mouth of his imperious wife. Accused by credible
      witnesses, and the evidence of his own subscription, the
      successor of St. Peter was despoiled of his pontifical ornaments,
      clad in the mean habit of a monk, and embarked, without delay,
      for a distant exile in the East. 9011 At the emperor’s command,
      the clergy of Rome proceeded to the choice of a new bishop; and
      after a solemn invocation of the Holy Ghost, elected the deacon
      Vigilius, who had purchased the papal throne by a bribe of two
      hundred pounds of gold. The profit, and consequently the guilt,
      of this simony, was imputed to Belisarius: but the hero obeyed
      the orders of his wife; Antonina served the passions of the
      empress; and Theodora lavished her treasures, in the vain hope of
      obtaining a pontiff hostile or indifferent to the council of
      Chalcedon. 91

      or from the local maps of Lameti and Cingolani. Seven or eight
      miles from the city, (50 stadia,) on the road to Albano, between
      the Latin and Appian ways, I discern the remains of an aqueduct,

      characteristic, but passionate. Hear the execrations of Cardinal
      Baronius, (A.D. 536, No. 123 A.D. 538, No. 4—20:) portentum,
      facinus omni execratione dignum.]

      The epistle of Belisarius to the emperor announced his victory,
      his danger, and his resolution. “According to your commands, we
      have entered the dominions of the Goths, and reduced to your
      obedience Sicily, Campania, and the city of Rome; but the loss of
      these conquests will be more disgraceful than their acquisition
      was glorious. Hitherto we have successfully fought against the
      multitudes of the Barbarians, but their multitudes may finally
      prevail. Victory is the gift of Providence, but the reputation of
      kings and generals depends on the success or the failure of their
      designs. Permit me to speak with freedom: if you wish that we
      should live, send us subsistence; if you desire that we should
      conquer, send us arms, horses, and men. The Romans have received
      us as friends and deliverers: but in our present distress, they
      will be either betrayed by their confidence, or we shall be
      oppressed by their treachery and hatred. For myself, my life is
      consecrated to your service: it is yours to reflect, whether my
      death in this situation will contribute to the glory and
      prosperity of your reign.” Perhaps that reign would have been
      equally prosperous if the peaceful master of the East had
      abstained from the conquest of Africa and Italy: but as Justinian
      was ambitious of fame, he made some efforts (they were feeble and
      languid) to support and rescue his victorious general. A
      reenforcement of sixteen hundred Sclavonians and Huns was led by
      Martin and Valerian; and as they reposed during the winter season
      in the harbors of Greece, the strength of the men and horses was
      not impaired by the fatigues of a sea-voyage; and they
      distinguished their valor in the first sally against the
      besiegers. About the time of the summer solstice, Euthalius
      landed at Terracina with large sums of money for the payment of
      the troops: he cautiously proceeded along the Appian way, and
      this convoy entered Rome through the gate Capena, 92 while
      Belisarius, on the other side, diverted the attention of the
      Goths by a vigorous and successful skirmish. These seasonable
      aids, the use and reputation of which were dexterously managed by
      the Roman general, revived the courage, or at least the hopes, of
      the soldiers and people. The historian Procopius was despatched
      with an important commission to collect the troops and provisions
      which Campania could furnish, or Constantinople had sent; and the
      secretary of Belisarius was soon followed by Antonina herself, 93
      who boldly traversed the posts of the enemy, and returned with
      the Oriental succors to the relief of her husband and the
      besieged city. A fleet of three thousand Isaurians cast anchor in
      the Bay of Naples and afterwards at Ostia. Above two thousand
      horse, of whom a part were Thracians, landed at Tarentum; and,
      after the junction of five hundred soldiers of Campania, and a
      train of wagons laden with wine and flour, they directed their
      march on the Appian way, from Capua to the neighborhood of Rome.
      The forces that arrived by land and sea were united at the mouth
      of the Tyber. Antonina convened a council of war: it was resolved
      to surmount, with sails and oars, the adverse stream of the
      river; and the Goths were apprehensive of disturbing, by any rash
      hostilities, the negotiation to which Belisarius had craftily
      listened. They credulously believed that they saw no more than
      the vanguard of a fleet and army, which already covered the
      Ionian Sea and the plains of Campania; and the illusion was
      supported by the haughty language of the Roman general, when he
      gave audience to the ambassadors of Vitiges. After a specious
      discourse to vindicate the justice of his cause, they declared,
      that, for the sake of peace, they were disposed to renounce the
      possession of Sicily. “The emperor is not less generous,” replied
      his lieutenant, with a disdainful smile, “in return for a gift
      which you no longer possess: he presents you with an ancient
      province of the empire; he resigns to the Goths the sovereignty
      of the British island.” Belisarius rejected with equal firmness
      and contempt the offer of a tribute; but he allowed the Gothic
      ambassadors to seek their fate from the mouth of Justinian
      himself; and consented, with seeming reluctance, to a truce of
      three months, from the winter solstice to the equinox of spring.
      Prudence might not safely trust either the oaths or hostages of
      the Barbarians, and the conscious superiority of the Roman chief
      was expressed in the distribution of his troops. As soon as fear
      or hunger compelled the Goths to evacuate Alba, Porto, and
      Centumcellae, their place was instantly supplied; the garrisons
      of Narni, Spoleto, and Perusia, were reenforced, and the seven
      camps of the besiegers were gradually encompassed with the
      calamities of a siege. The prayers and pilgrimage of Datius,
      bishop of Milan, were not without effect; and he obtained one
      thousand Thracians and Isaurians, to assist the revolt of Liguria
      against her Arian tyrant. At the same time, John the Sanguinary,
      94 the nephew of Vitalian, was detached with two thousand chosen
      horse, first to Alba, on the Fucine Lake, and afterwards to the
      frontiers of Picenum, on the Hadriatic Sea. “In the province,”
      said Belisarius, “the Goths have deposited their families and
      treasures, without a guard or the suspicion of danger. Doubtless
      they will violate the truce: let them feel your presence, before
      they hear of your motions. Spare the Italians; suffer not any
      fortified places to remain hostile in your rear; and faithfully
      reserve the spoil for an equal and common partition. It would not
      be reasonable,” he added with a laugh, “that whilst we are
      toiling to the destruction of the drones, our more fortunate
      brethren should rifle and enjoy the honey.”

      The whole nation of the Ostrogoths had been assembled for the
      attack, and was almost entirely consumed in the siege of Rome. If
      any credit be due to an intelligent spectator, one third at least
      of their enormous host was destroyed, in frequent and bloody
      combats under the walls of the city. The bad fame and pernicious
      qualities of the summer air might already be imputed to the decay
      of agriculture and population; and the evils of famine and
      pestilence were aggravated by their own licentiousness, and the
      unfriendly disposition of the country. While Vitiges struggled
      with his fortune, while he hesitated between shame and ruin, his
      retreat was hastened by domestic alarms. The king of the Goths
      was informed by trembling messengers, that John the Sanguinary
      spread the devastations of war from the Apennine to the
      Hadriatic; that the rich spoils and innumerable captives of
      Picenum were lodged in the fortifications of Rimini; and that
      this formidable chief had defeated his uncle, insulted his
      capital, and seduced, by secret correspondence, the fidelity of
      his wife, the imperious daughter of Amalasontha. Yet, before he
      retired, Vitiges made a last effort, either to storm or to
      surprise the city. A secret passage was discovered in one of the
      aqueducts; two citizens of the Vatican were tempted by bribes to
      intoxicate the guards of the Aurelian gate; an attack was
      meditated on the walls beyond the Tyber, in a place which was not
      fortified with towers; and the Barbarians advanced, with torches
      and scaling-ladders, to the assault of the Pincian gate. But
      every attempt was defeated by the intrepid vigilance of
      Belisarius and his band of veterans, who, in the most perilous
      moments, did not regret the absence of their companions; and the
      Goths, alike destitute of hope and subsistence, clamorously urged
      their departure before the truce should expire, and the Roman
      cavalry should again be united. One year and nine days after the
      commencement of the siege, an army, so lately strong and
      triumphant, burnt their tents, and tumultuously repassed the
      Milvian bridge. They repassed not with impunity: their thronging
      multitudes, oppressed in a narrow passage, were driven headlong
      into the Tyber, by their own fears and the pursuit of the enemy;
      and the Roman general, sallying from the Pincian gate, inflicted
      a severe and disgraceful wound on their retreat. The slow length
      of a sickly and desponding host was heavily dragged along the
      Flaminian way; from whence the Barbarians were sometimes
      compelled to deviate, lest they should encounter the hostile
      garrisons that guarded the high road to Rimini and Ravenna. Yet
      so powerful was this flying army, that Vitiges spared ten
      thousand men for the defence of the cities which he was most
      solicitous to preserve, and detached his nephew Uraias, with an
      adequate force, for the chastisement of rebellious Milan. At the
      head of his principal army, he besieged Rimini, only thirty-three
      miles distant from the Gothic capital. A feeble rampart, and a
      shallow ditch, were maintained by the skill and valor of John the
      Sanguinary, who shared the danger and fatigue of the meanest
      soldier, and emulated, on a theatre less illustrious, the
      military virtues of his great commander. The towers and
      battering-engines of the Barbarians were rendered useless; their
      attacks were repulsed; and the tedious blockade, which reduced
      the garrison to the last extremity of hunger, afforded time for
      the union and march of the Roman forces. A fleet, which had
      surprised Ancona, sailed along the coast of the Hadriatic, to the
      relief of the besieged city. The eunuch Narses landed in Picenum
      with two thousand Heruli and five thousand of the bravest troops
      of the East. The rock of the Apennine was forced; ten thousand
      veterans moved round the foot of the mountains, under the command
      of Belisarius himself; and a new army, whose encampment blazed
      with innumerable lights, appeared to advance along the Flaminian
      way. Overwhelmed with astonishment and despair, the Goths
      abandoned the siege of Rimini, their tents, their standards, and
      their leaders; and Vitiges, who gave or followed the example of
      flight, never halted till he found a shelter within the walls and
      morasses of Ravenna. To these walls, and to some fortresses
      destitute of any mutual support, the Gothic monarchy was now
      reduced. The provinces of Italy had embraced the party of the
      emperor and his army, gradually recruited to the number of twenty
      thousand men, must have achieved an easy and rapid conquest, if
      their invincible powers had not been weakened by the discord of
      the Roman chiefs. Before the end of the siege, an act of blood,
      ambiguous and indiscreet, sullied the fair fame of Belisarius.
      Presidius, a loyal Italian, as he fled from Ravenna to Rome, was
      rudely stopped by Constantine, the military governor of Spoleto,
      and despoiled, even in a church, of two daggers richly inlaid
      with gold and precious stones. As soon as the public danger had
      subsided, Presidius complained of the loss and injury: his
      complaint was heard, but the order of restitution was disobeyed
      by the pride and avarice of the offender. Exasperated by the
      delay, Presidius boldly arrested the general’s horse as he passed
      through the forum; and, with the spirit of a citizen, demanded
      the common benefit of the Roman laws. The honor of Belisarius was
      engaged; he summoned a council; claimed the obedience of his
      subordinate officer; and was provoked, by an insolent reply, to
      call hastily for the presence of his guards. Constantine, viewing
      their entrance as the signal of death, drew his sword, and rushed
      on the general, who nimbly eluded the stroke, and was protected
      by his friends; while the desperate assassin was disarmed,
      dragged into a neighboring chamber, and executed, or rather
      murdered, by the guards, at the arbitrary command of Belisarius.
      95 In this hasty act of violence, the guilt of Constantine was no
      longer remembered; the despair and death of that valiant officer
      were secretly imputed to the revenge of Antonina; and each of his
      colleagues, conscious of the same rapine, was apprehensive of the
      same fate. The fear of a common enemy suspended the effects of
      their envy and discontent; but in the confidence of approaching
      victory, they instigated a powerful rival to oppose the conqueror
      of Rome and Africa. From the domestic service of the palace, and
      the administration of the private revenue, Narses the eunuch was
      suddenly exalted to the head of an army; and the spirit of a
      hero, who afterwards equalled the merit and glory of Belisarius,
      served only to perplex the operations of the Gothic war. To his
      prudent counsels, the relief of Rimini was ascribed by the
      leaders of the discontented faction, who exhorted Narses to
      assume an independent and separate command. The epistle of
      Justinian had indeed enjoined his obedience to the general; but
      the dangerous exception, “as far as may be advantageous to the
      public service,” reserved some freedom of judgment to the
      discreet favorite, who had so lately departed from the sacred and
      familiar conversation of his sovereign. In the exercise of this
      doubtful right, the eunuch perpetually dissented from the
      opinions of Belisarius; and, after yielding with reluctance to
      the siege of Urbino, he deserted his colleague in the night, and
      marched away to the conquest of the Aemilian province. The fierce
      and formidable bands of the Heruli were attached to the person of
      Narses; 96 ten thousand Romans and confederates were persuaded to
      march under his banners; every malcontent  embraced the fair
      opportunity of revenging his private or imaginary wrongs; and the
      remaining troops of Belisarius were divided and dispersed from
      the garrisons of Sicily to the shores of the Hadriatic. His skill
      and perseverance overcame every obstacle: Urbino was taken, the
      sieges of Faesulae Orvieto, and Auximum, were undertaken and
      vigorously prosecuted; and the eunuch Narses was at length
      recalled to the domestic cares of the palace. All dissensions
      were healed, and all opposition was subdued, by the temperate
      authority of the Roman general, to whom his enemies could not
      refuse their esteem; and Belisarius inculcated the salutary
      lesson that the forces of the state should compose one body, and
      be animated by one soul. But in the interval of discord, the
      Goths were permitted to breathe; an important season was lost,
      Milan was destroyed, and the northern provinces of Italy were
      afflicted by an inundation of the Franks.

      (Goth. l. ii. c. 8) with candor or caution; in the Anecdotes (c.
      7) with malevolence or freedom; but Marcellinus, or rather his
      continuator, (in Chron.,) casts a shade of premeditated
      assassination over the death of Constantine. He had performed
      good service at Rome and Spoleto, (Procop. Goth l. i. c. 7, 14;)
      but Alemannus confounds him with a Constantianus comes stabuli.]

      96 (return) [ They refused to serve after his departure; sold
      their captives and cattle to the Goths; and swore never to fight
      against them. Procopius introduces a curious digression on the
      manners and adventures of this wandering nation, a part of whom
      finally emigrated to Thule or Scandinavia. (Goth. l. ii. c. 14,
      15.)]

      When Justinian first meditated the conquest of Italy, he sent
      ambassadors to the kings of the Franks, and adjured them, by the
      common ties of alliance and religion, to join in the holy
      enterprise against the Arians. The Goths, as their wants were
      more urgent, employed a more effectual mode of persuasion, and
      vainly strove, by the gift of lands and money, to purchase the
      friendship, or at least the neutrality, of a light and perfidious
      nation. But the arms of Belisarius, and the revolt of the
      Italians, had no sooner shaken the Gothic monarchy, than
      Theodebert of Austrasia, the most powerful and warlike of the
      Merovingian kings, was persuaded to succor their distress by an
      indirect and seasonable aid. Without expecting the consent of
      their sovereign, ten thousand Burgundians, his recent subjects,
      descended from the Alps, and joined the troops which Vitiges had
      sent to chastise the revolt of Milan. After an obstinate siege,
      the capital of Liguria was reduced by famine; but no capitulation
      could be obtained, except for the safe retreat of the Roman
      garrison. Datius, the orthodox bishop, who had seduced his
      countrymen to rebellion 98 and ruin, escaped to the luxury and
      honors of the Byzantine court; 99 but the clergy, perhaps the
      Arian clergy, were slaughtered at the foot of their own altars by
      the defenders of the Catholic faith. Three hundred thousand males
      were reported to be slain; 100 the female sex, and the more
      precious spoil, was resigned to the Burgundians; and the houses,
      or at least the walls, of Milan, were levelled with the ground.
      The Goths, in their last moments, were revenged by the
      destruction of a city, second only to Rome in size and opulence,
      in the splendor of its buildings, or the number of its
      inhabitants; and Belisarius sympathized alone in the fate of his
      deserted and devoted friends. Encouraged by this successful
      inroad, Theodebert himself, in the ensuing spring, invaded the
      plains of Italy with an army of one hundred thousand Barbarians.
      101 The king, and some chosen followers, were mounted on
      horseback, and armed with lances; the infantry, without bows or
      spears, were satisfied with a shield, a sword, and a double-edged
      battle-axe, which, in their hands, became a deadly and unerring
      weapon. Italy trembled at the march of the Franks; and both the
      Gothic prince and the Roman general, alike ignorant of their
      designs, solicited, with hope and terror, the friendship of these
      dangerous allies. Till he had secured the passage of the Po on
      the bridge of Pavia, the grandson of Clovis dissembled his
      intentions, which he at length declared, by assaulting, almost at
      the same instant, the hostile camps of the Romans and Goths.
      Instead of uniting their arms, they fled with equal
      precipitation; and the fertile, though desolate provinces of
      Liguria and Aemilia, were abandoned to a licentious host of
      Barbarians, whose rage was not mitigated by any thoughts of
      settlement or conquest. Among the cities which they ruined,
      Genoa, not yet constructed of marble, is particularly enumerated;
      and the deaths of thousands, according to the regular practice of
      war, appear to have excited less horror than some idolatrous
      sacrifices of women and children, which were performed with
      impunity in the camp of the most Christian king. If it were not a
      melancholy truth, that the first and most cruel sufferings must
      be the lot of the innocent and helpless, history might exult in
      the misery of the conquerors, who, in the midst of riches, were
      left destitute of bread or wine, reduced to drink the waters of
      the Po, and to feed on the flesh of distempered cattle. The
      dysentery swept away one third of their army; and the clamors of
      his subjects, who were impatient to pass the Alps, disposed
      Theodebert to listen with respect to the mild exhortations of
      Belisarius. The memory of this inglorious and destructive warfare
      was perpetuated on the medals of Gaul; and Justinian, without
      unsheathing his sword, assumed the title of conqueror of the
      Franks. The Merovingian prince was offended by the vanity of the
      emperor; he affected to pity the fallen fortunes of the Goths;
      and his insidious offer of a federal union was fortified by the
      promise or menace of descending from the Alps at the head of five
      hundred thousand men. His plans of conquest were boundless, and
      perhaps chimerical. The king of Austrasia threatened to chastise
      Justinian, and to march to the gates of Constantinople: 102 he
      was overthrown and slain 103 by a wild bull, 104 as he hunted in
      the Belgic or German forests. [Footnote 97: This national
      reproach of perfidy (Procop. Goth. l. ii. c. 25) offends the ear

      Chapter XLI: Conquests Of Justinian, Charact Of Balisarius.—Part
      V.

      As soon as Belisarius was delivered from his foreign and domestic
      enemies, he seriously applied his forces to the final reduction
      of Italy. In the siege of Osimo, the general was nearly
      transpierced with an arrow, if the mortal stroke had not been
      intercepted by one of his guards, who lost, in that pious office,
      the use of his hand. The Goths of Osimo, 1041 four thousand
      warriors, with those of Faesulae and the Cottian Alps, were among
      the last who maintained their independence; and their gallant
      resistance, which almost tired the patience, deserved the esteem,
      of the conqueror. His prudence refused to subscribe the safe
      conduct which they asked, to join their brethren of Ravenna; but
      they saved, by an honorable capitulation, one moiety at least of
      their wealth, with the free alternative of retiring peaceably to
      their estates, or enlisting to serve the emperor in his Persian
      wars. The multitudes which yet adhered to the standard of Vitiges
      far surpassed the number of the Roman troops; but neither prayers
      nor defiance, nor the extreme danger of his most faithful
      subjects, could tempt the Gothic king beyond the fortifications
      of Ravenna. These fortifications were, indeed, impregnable to the
      assaults of art or violence; and when Belisarius invested the
      capital, he was soon convinced that famine only could tame the
      stubborn spirit of the Barbarians. The sea, the land, and the
      channels of the Po, were guarded by the vigilance of the Roman
      general; and his morality extended the rights of war to the
      practice of poisoning the waters, 105 and secretly firing the
      granaries 106 of a besieged city. 107 While he pressed the
      blockade of Ravenna, he was surprised by the arrival of two
      ambassadors from Constantinople, with a treaty of peace, which
      Justinian had imprudently signed, without deigning to consult the
      author of his victory. By this disgraceful and precarious
      agreement, Italy and the Gothic treasure were divided, and the
      provinces beyond the Po were left with the regal title to the
      successor of Theodoric. The ambassadors were eager to accomplish
      their salutary commission; the captive Vitiges accepted, with
      transport, the unexpected offer of a crown; honor was less
      prevalent among the Goths, than the want and appetite of food;
      and the Roman chiefs, who murmured at the continuance of the war,
      professed implicit submission to the commands of the emperor. If
      Belisarius had possessed only the courage of a soldier, the
      laurel would have been snatched from his hand by timid and
      envious counsels; but in this decisive moment, he resolved, with
      the magnanimity of a statesman, to sustain alone the danger and
      merit of generous disobedience. Each of his officers gave a
      written opinion that the siege of Ravenna was impracticable and
      hopeless: the general then rejected the treaty of partition, and
      declared his own resolution of leading Vitiges in chains to the
      feet of Justinian. The Goths retired with doubt and dismay: this
      peremptory refusal deprived them of the only signature which they
      could trust, and filled their minds with a just apprehension,
      that a sagacious enemy had discovered the full extent of their
      deplorable state. They compared the fame and fortune of
      Belisarius with the weakness of their ill-fated king; and the
      comparison suggested an extraordinary project, to which Vitiges,
      with apparent resignation, was compelled to acquiesce. Partition
      would ruin the strength, exile would disgrace the honor, of the
      nation; but they offered their arms, their treasures, and the
      fortifications of Ravenna, if Belisarius would disclaim the
      authority of a master, accept the choice of the Goths, and
      assume, as he had deserved, the kingdom of Italy. If the false
      lustre of a diadem could have tempted the loyalty of a faithful
      subject, his prudence must have foreseen the inconstancy of the
      Barbarians, and his rational ambition would prefer the safe and
      honorable station of a Roman general. Even the patience and
      seeming satisfaction with which he entertained a proposal of
      treason, might be susceptible of a malignant interpretation. But
      the lieutenant of Justinian was conscious of his own rectitude;
      he entered into a dark and crooked path, as it might lead to the
      voluntary submission of the Goths; and his dexterous policy
      persuaded them that he was disposed to comply with their wishes,
      without engaging an oath or a promise for the performance of a
      treaty which he secretly abhorred. The day of the surrender of
      Ravenna was stipulated by the Gothic ambassadors: a fleet, laden
      with provisions, sailed as a welcome guest into the deepest
      recess of the harbor: the gates were opened to the fancied king
      of Italy; and Belisarius, without meeting an enemy, triumphantly
      marched through the streets of an impregnable city. 108 The
      Romans were astonished by their success; the multitudes of tall
      and robust Barbarians were confounded by the image of their own
      patience and the masculine females, spitting in the faces of
      their sons and husbands, most bitterly reproached them for
      betraying their dominion and freedom to these pygmies of the
      south, contemptible in their numbers, diminutive in their
      stature. Before the Goths could recover from the first surprise,
      and claim the accomplishment of their doubtful hopes, the victor
      established his power in Ravenna, beyond the danger of repentance
      and revolt.

      107 (return) [ In strict philosophy, a limitation of the rights
      of war seems to imply nonsense and contradiction. Grotius himself
      is lost in an idle distinction between the jus naturae and the

      scale the passages of Homer (Odyss. A 259, &c.) and Florus, (l.
      ii. c. 20, No. 7, ult.;) and in the other, the examples of Solon
      (Pausanias, l. x. c. 37) and Belisarius. See his great work De
      Jure Belli et Pacis, (l. iii. c. 4, s. 15, 16, 17, and in
      Barbeyrac’s version, tom. ii. p. 257, &c.) Yet I can understand
      the benefit and validity of an agreement, tacit or express,
      mutually to abstain from certain modes of hostility. See the
      Amphictyonic oath in Aeschines, de falsa Legatione.]

      108 (return) [ Ravenna was taken, not in the year 540, but in the
      latter end of 539; and Pagi (tom. ii. p. 569) is rectified by

      correspondence were restored between Ravenna and Faenza.]
      Vitiges, who perhaps had attempted to escape, was honorably
      guarded in his palace; 109 the flower of the Gothic youth was
      selected for the service of the emperor; the remainder of the
      people was dismissed to their peaceful habitations in the
      southern provinces; and a colony of Italians was invited to
      replenish the depopulated city. The submission of the capital was
      imitated in the towns and villages of Italy, which had not been
      subdued, or even visited, by the Romans; and the independent
      Goths, who remained in arms at Pavia and Verona, were ambitious
      only to become the subjects of Belisarius. But his inflexible
      loyalty rejected, except as the substitute of Justinian, their
      oaths of allegiance; and he was not offended by the reproach of
      their deputies, that he rather chose to be a slave than a king.

      109 (return) [ He was seized by John the Sanguinary, but an oath
      or sacrament was pledged for his safety in the Basilica Julii,
      (Hist. Miscell. l. xvii. in Muratori, tom. i. p. 107.) Anastasius
      (in Vit. Pont. p. 40) gives a dark but probable account.
      Montfaucon is quoted by Mascou (Hist. of the Germans, xii. 21)
      for a votive shield representing the captivity of Vitiges and now
      in the collection of Signor Landi at Rome.]

      After the second victory of Belisarius, envy again whispered,
      Justinian listened, and the hero was recalled. “The remnant of
      the Gothic war was no longer worthy of his presence: a gracious
      sovereign was impatient to reward his services, and to consult
      his wisdom; and he alone was capable of defending the East
      against the innumerable armies of Persia.” Belisarius understood
      the suspicion, accepted the excuse, embarked at Ravenna his
      spoils and trophies; and proved, by his ready obedience, that
      such an abrupt removal from the government of Italy was not less
      unjust than it might have been indiscreet. The emperor received
      with honorable courtesy both Vitiges and his more noble consort;
      and as the king of the Goths conformed to the Athanasian faith,
      he obtained, with a rich inheritance of land in Asia, the rank of
      senator and patrician. Every spectator admired, without peril,
      the strength and stature of the young Barbarians: they adored the
      majesty of the throne, and promised to shed their blood in the
      service of their benefactor. Justinian deposited in the Byzantine
      palace the treasures of the Gothic monarchy. A flattering senate
      was sometime admitted to gaze on the magnificent spectacle; but
      it was enviously secluded from the public view: and the conqueror
      of Italy renounced, without a murmur, perhaps without a sigh, the
      well-earned honors of a second triumph. His glory was indeed
      exalted above all external pomp; and the faint and hollow praises
      of the court were supplied, even in a servile age, by the respect
      and admiration of his country. Whenever he appeared in the
      streets and public places of Constantinople, Belisarius attracted
      and satisfied the eyes of the people. His lofty stature and
      majestic countenance fulfilled their expectations of a hero; the
      meanest of his fellow-citizens were emboldened by his gentle and
      gracious demeanor; and the martial train which attended his
      footsteps left his person more accessible than in a day of
      battle. Seven thousand horsemen, matchless for beauty and valor,
      were maintained in the service, and at the private expense, of
      the general. 111 Their prowess was always conspicuous in single
      combats, or in the foremost ranks; and both parties confessed
      that in the siege of Rome, the guards of Belisarius had alone
      vanquished the Barbarian host. Their numbers were continually
      augmented by the bravest and most faithful of the enemy; and his
      fortunate captives, the Vandals, the Moors, and the Goths,
      emulated the attachment of his domestic followers. By the union
      of liberality and justice, he acquired the love of the soldiers,
      without alienating the affections of the people. The sick and
      wounded were relieved with medicines and money; and still more
      efficaciously, by the healing visits and smiles of their
      commander. The loss of a weapon or a horse was instantly
      repaired, and each deed of valor was rewarded by the rich and
      honorable gifts of a bracelet or a collar, which were rendered
      more precious by the judgment of Belisarius. He was endeared to
      the husbandmen by the peace and plenty which they enjoyed under
      the shadow of his standard. Instead of being injured, the country
      was enriched by the march of the Roman armies; and such was the
      rigid discipline of their camp, that not an apple was gathered
      from the tree, not a path could be traced in the fields of corn.
      Belisarius was chaste and sober. In the license of a military
      life, none could boast that they had seen him intoxicated with
      wine: the most beautiful captives of Gothic or Vandal race were
      offered to his embraces; but he turned aside from their charms,
      and the husband of Antonina was never suspected of violating the
      laws of conjugal fidelity. The spectator and historian of his
      exploits has observed, that amidst the perils of war, he was
      daring without rashness, prudent without fear, slow or rapid
      according to the exigencies of the moment; that in the deepest
      distress he was animated by real or apparent hope, but that he
      was modest and humble in the most prosperous fortune. By these
      virtues, he equalled or excelled the ancient masters of the
      military art. Victory, by sea and land, attended his arms. He
      subdued Africa, Italy, and the adjacent islands; led away
      captives the successors of Genseric and Theodoric; filled
      Constantinople with the spoils of their palaces; and in the space
      of six years recovered half the provinces of the Western empire.
      In his fame and merit, in wealth and power, he remained without a
      rival, the first of the Roman subjects; the voice of envy could
      only magnify his dangerous importance; and the emperor might
      applaud his own discerning spirit, which had discovered and
      raised the genius of Belisarius. [Footnote 110: Vitiges lived two
      years at Constantinople, and imperatoris in affectu convictus (or
      conjunctus) rebus excessit humanis. His widow Mathasuenta, the
      wife and mother of the patricians, the elder and younger
      Germanus, united the streams of Anician and Amali blood,
      (Jornandes, c. 60, p. 221, in Muratori, tom. i.)]

      111 (return) [ Procopius, Goth. l. iii. c. 1. Aimoin, a French
      monk of the xith century, who had obtained, and has disfigured,
      some authentic information of Belisarius, mentions, in his name,
      12,000, pueri or slaves—quos propriis alimus stipendiis—besides
      18,000 soldiers, (Historians of France, tom. iii. De Gestis
      Franc. l. ii. c. 6, p. 48.)]

      It was the custom of the Roman triumphs, that a slave should be
      placed behind the chariot to remind the conqueror of the
      instability of fortune, and the infirmities of human nature.
      Procopius, in his Anecdotes, has assumed that servile and
      ungrateful office. The generous reader may cast away the libel,
      but the evidence of facts will adhere to his memory; and he will
      reluctantly confess, that the fame, and even the virtue, of
      Belisarius, were polluted by the lust and cruelty of his wife;
      and that hero deserved an appellation which may not drop from the
      pen of the decent historian. The mother of Antonina 112 was a
      theatrical prostitute, and both her father and grandfather
      exercised, at Thessalonica and Constantinople, the vile, though
      lucrative, profession of charioteers. In the various situations
      of their fortune she became the companion, the enemy, the
      servant, and the favorite of the empress Theodora: these loose
      and ambitious females had been connected by similar pleasures;
      they were separated by the jealousy of vice, and at length
      reconciled by the partnership of guilt. Before her marriage with
      Belisarius, Antonina had one husband and many lovers: Photius,
      the son of her former nuptials, was of an age to distinguish
      himself at the siege of Naples; and it was not till the autumn of
      her age and beauty 113 that she indulged a scandalous attachment
      to a Thracian youth. Theodosius had been educated in the Eunomian
      heresy; the African voyage was consecrated by the baptism and
      auspicious name of the first soldier who embarked; and the
      proselyte was adopted into the family of his spiritual parents,
      114 Belisarius and Antonina. Before they touched the shores of
      Africa, this holy kindred degenerated into sensual love: and as
      Antonina soon overleaped the bounds of modesty and caution, the
      Roman general was alone ignorant of his own dishonor. During
      their residence at Carthage, he surprised the two lovers in a
      subterraneous chamber, solitary, warm, and almost naked. Anger
      flashed from his eyes. “With the help of this young man,” said
      the unblushing Antonina, “I was secreting our most precious
      effects from the knowledge of Justinian.” The youth resumed his
      garments, and the pious husband consented to disbelieve the
      evidence of his own senses. From this pleasing and perhaps
      voluntary delusion, Belisarius was awakened at Syracuse, by the
      officious information of Macedonia; and that female attendant,
      after requiring an oath for her security, produced two
      chamberlains, who, like herself, had often beheld the adulteries
      of Antonina. A hasty flight into Asia saved Theodosius from the
      justice of an injured husband, who had signified to one of his
      guards the order of his death; but the tears of Antonina, and her
      artful seductions, assured the credulous hero of her innocence:
      and he stooped, against his faith and judgment, to abandon those
      imprudent friends, who had presumed to accuse or doubt the
      chastity of his wife. The revenge of a guilty woman is implacable
      and bloody: the unfortunate Macedonia, with the two witnesses,
      were secretly arrested by the minister of her cruelty; their
      tongues were cut out, their bodies were hacked into small pieces,
      and their remains were cast into the Sea of Syracuse. A rash
      though judicious saying of Constantine, “I would sooner have
      punished the adulteress than the boy,” was deeply remembered by
      Antonina; and two years afterwards, when despair had armed that
      officer against his general, her sanguinary advice decided and
      hastened his execution. Even the indignation of Photius was not
      forgiven by his mother; the exile of her son prepared the recall
      of her lover; and Theodosius condescended to accept the pressing
      and humble invitation of the conqueror of Italy. In the absolute
      direction of his household, and in the important commissions of
      peace and war, 115 the favorite youth most rapidly acquired a
      fortune of four hundred thousand pounds sterling; and after their
      return to Constantinople, the passion of Antonina, at least,
      continued ardent and unabated. But fear, devotion, and lassitude
      perhaps, inspired Theodosius with more serious thoughts. He
      dreaded the busy scandal of the capital, and the indiscreet
      fondness of the wife of Belisarius; escaped from her embraces,
      and retiring to Ephesus, shaved his head, and took refuge in the
      sanctuary of a monastic life. The despair of the new Ariadne
      could scarcely have been excused by the death of her husband. She
      wept, she tore her hair, she filled the palace with her cries;
      “she had lost the dearest of friends, a tender, a faithful, a
      laborious friend!” But her warm entreaties, fortified by the
      prayers of Belisarius, were insufficient to draw the holy monk
      from the solitude of Ephesus. It was not till the general moved
      forward for the Persian war, that Theodosius could be tempted to
      return to Constantinople; and the short interval before the
      departure of Antonina herself was boldly devoted to love and
      pleasure.

      the four first and most curious chapters of the Anecdotes. Of
      these strange Anecdotes, a part may be true, because probable—and
      a part true, because improbable. Procopius must have known the
      former, and the latter he could scarcely invent. Note: The malice
      of court scandal is proverbially inventive; and of such scandal
      the “Anecdota” may be an embellished record.—M.]

      years of age. A forced, but more polite construction, which
      refers that date to the moment when he was writing, (A.D. 559,)
      would be compatible with the manhood of Photius, (Gothic. l. i.
      c. 10) in 536.]

      baptismal adoption was revived by Leo the philosopher.]

      115 (return) [ In November, 537, Photius arrested the pope,
      (Liberat. Brev. c. 22. Pagi, tom. ii. p. 562) About the end of
      539, Belisarius sent Theodosius on an important and lucrative
      commission to Ravenna, (Goth. l. ii. c. 18.)]

      A philosopher may pity and forgive the infirmities of female
      nature, from which he receives no real injury: but contemptible
      is the husband who feels, and yet endures, his own infamy in that
      of his wife. Antonina pursued her son with implacable hatred; and
      the gallant Photius 116 was exposed to her secret persecutions in
      the camp beyond the Tigris. Enraged by his own wrongs, and by the
      dishonor of his blood, he cast away in his turn the sentiments of
      nature, and revealed to Belisarius the turpitude of a woman who
      had violated all the duties of a mother and a wife. From the
      surprise and indignation of the Roman general, his former
      credulity appears to have been sincere: he embraced the knees of
      the son of Antonina, adjured him to remember his obligations
      rather than his birth, and confirmed at the altar their holy vows
      of revenge and mutual defence. The dominion of Antonina was
      impaired by absence; and when she met her husband, on his return
      from the Persian confines, Belisarius, in his first and transient
      emotions, confined her person, and threatened her life. Photius
      was more resolved to punish, and less prompt to pardon: he flew
      to Ephesus; extorted from a trusty eunuch of his mother the full
      confession of her guilt; arrested Theodosius and his treasures in
      the church of St. John the Apostle, and concealed his captives,
      whose execution was only delayed, in a secure and sequestered
      fortress of Cilicia. Such a daring outrage against public justice
      could not pass with impunity; and the cause of Antonina was
      espoused by the empress, whose favor she had deserved by the
      recent services of the disgrace of a praefect, and the exile and
      murder of a pope. At the end of the campaign, Belisarius was
      recalled; he complied, as usual, with the Imperial mandate. His
      mind was not prepared for rebellion: his obedience, however
      adverse to the dictates of honor, was consonant to the wishes of
      his heart; and when he embraced his wife, at the command, and
      perhaps in the presence, of the empress, the tender husband was
      disposed to forgive or to be forgiven. The bounty of Theodora
      reserved for her companion a more precious favor. “I have found,”
      she said, “my dearest patrician, a pearl of inestimable value; it
      has not yet been viewed by any mortal eye; but the sight and the
      possession of this jewel are destined for my friend.” 1161 As
      soon as the curiosity and impatience of Antonina were kindled,
      the door of a bed-chamber was thrown open, and she beheld her
      lover, whom the diligence of the eunuchs had discovered in his
      secret prison. Her silent wonder burst into passionate
      exclamations of gratitude and joy, and she named Theodora her
      queen, her benefactress, and her savior. The monk of Ephesus was
      nourished in the palace with luxury and ambition; but instead of
      assuming, as he was promised, the command of the Roman armies,
      Theodosius expired in the first fatigues of an amorous interview.
      1162 The grief of Antonina could only be assuaged by the
      sufferings of her son. A youth of consular rank, and a sickly
      constitution, was punished, without a trial, like a malefactor
      and a slave: yet such was the constancy of his mind, that Photius
      sustained the tortures of the scourge and the rack, 1163 without
      violating the faith which he had sworn to Belisarius. After this
      fruitless cruelty, the son of Antonina, while his mother feasted
      with the empress, was buried in her subterraneous prisons, which
      admitted not the distinction of night and day. He twice escaped
      to the most venerable sanctuaries of Constantinople, the churches
      of St. Sophia, and of the Virgin: but his tyrants were insensible
      of religion as of pity; and the helpless youth, amidst the
      clamors of the clergy and people, was twice dragged from the
      altar to the dungeon. His third attempt was more successful. At
      the end of three years, the prophet Zachariah, or some mortal
      friend, indicated the means of an escape: he eluded the spies and
      guards of the empress, reached the holy sepulchre of Jerusalem,
      embraced the profession of a monk; and the abbot Photius was
      employed, after the death of Justinian, to reconcile and regulate
      the churches of Egypt. The son of Antonina suffered all that an
      enemy can inflict: her patient husband imposed on himself the
      more exquisite misery of violating his promise and deserting his
      friend.

      diet of a monk to the luxury of the court is a much more probable
      cause of his death.—M.]

      1163 (return) [ The expression of Procopius does not appear to me
      to mean this kind of torture. Ibid.—M.]

      In the succeeding campaign, Belisarius was again sent against the
      Persians: he saved the East, but he offended Theodora, and
      perhaps the emperor himself. The malady of Justinian had
      countenanced the rumor of his death; and the Roman general, on
      the supposition of that probable event spoke the free language of
      a citizen and a soldier. His colleague Buzes, who concurred in
      the same sentiments, lost his rank, his liberty, and his health,
      by the persecution of the empress: but the disgrace of Belisarius
      was alleviated by the dignity of his own character, and the
      influence of his wife, who might wish to humble, but could not
      desire to ruin, the partner of her fortunes. Even his removal was
      colored by the assurance, that the sinking state of Italy would
      be retrieved by the single presence of its conqueror.

      But no sooner had he returned, alone and defenceless, than a
      hostile commission was sent to the East, to seize his treasures
      and criminate his actions; the guards and veterans, who followed
      his private banner, were distributed among the chiefs of the
      army, and even the eunuchs presumed to cast lots for the
      partition of his martial domestics. When he passed with a small
      and sordid retinue through the streets of Constantinople, his
      forlorn appearance excited the amazement and compassion of the
      people. Justinian and Theodora received him with cold
      ingratitude; the servile crowd, with insolence and contempt; and
      in the evening he retired with trembling steps to his deserted
      palace. An indisposition, feigned or real, had confined Antonina
      to her apartment; and she walked disdainfully silent in the
      adjacent portico, while Belisarius threw himself on his bed, and
      expected, in an agony of grief and terror, the death which he had
      so often braved under the walls of Rome. Long after sunset a
      messenger was announced from the empress: he opened, with anxious
      curiosity, the letter which contained the sentence of his fate.
      “You cannot be ignorant how much you have deserved my
      displeasure. I am not insensible of the services of Antonina. To
      her merits and intercession I have granted your life, and permit
      you to retain a part of your treasures, which might be justly
      forfeited to the state. Let your gratitude, where it is due, be
      displayed, not in words, but in your future behavior.” I know not
      how to believe or to relate the transports with which the hero is
      said to have received this ignominious pardon. He fell prostrate
      before his wife, he kissed the feet of his savior, and he
      devoutly promised to live the grateful and submissive slave of
      Antonina. A fine of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds
      sterling was levied on the fortunes of Belisarius; and with the
      office of count, or master of the royal stables, he accepted the
      conduct of the Italian war. At his departure from Constantinople,
      his friends, and even the public, were persuaded that as soon as
      he regained his freedom, he would renounce his dissimulation, and
      that his wife, Theodora, and perhaps the emperor himself, would
      be sacrificed to the just revenge of a virtuous rebel. Their
      hopes were deceived; and the unconquerable patience and loyalty
      of Belisarius appear either below or above the character of a
      man. 117
