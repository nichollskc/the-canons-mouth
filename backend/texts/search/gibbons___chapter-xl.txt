      The emperor Justinian was born 1 near the ruins of Sardica, (the
      modern Sophia,) of an obscure race 2 of Barbarians, 3 the
      inhabitants of a wild and desolate country, to which the names of
      Dardania, of Dacia, and of Bulgaria, have been successively
      applied. His elevation was prepared by the adventurous spirit of
      his uncle Justin, who, with two other peasants of the same
      village, deserted, for the profession of arms, the more useful
      employment of husbandmen or shepherds. 4 On foot, with a scanty
      provision of biscuit in their knapsacks, the three youths
      followed the high road of Constantinople, and were soon enrolled,
      for their strength and stature, among the guards of the emperor
      Leo. Under the two succeeding reigns, the fortunate peasant
      emerged to wealth and honors; and his escape from some dangers
      which threatened his life was afterwards ascribed to the guardian
      angel who watches over the fate of kings. His long and laudable
      service in the Isaurian and Persian wars would not have preserved
      from oblivion the name of Justin; yet they might warrant the
      military promotion, which in the course of fifty years he
      gradually obtained; the rank of tribune, of count, and of
      general; the dignity of senator, and the command of the guards,
      who obeyed him as their chief, at the important crisis when the
      emperor Anastasius was removed from the world. The powerful
      kinsmen whom he had raised and enriched were excluded from the
      throne; and the eunuch Amantius, who reigned in the palace, had
      secretly resolved to fix the diadem on the head of the most
      obsequious of his creatures. A liberal donative, to conciliate
      the suffrage of the guards, was intrusted for that purpose in the
      hands of their commander. But these weighty arguments were
      treacherously employed by Justin in his own favor; and as no
      competitor presumed to appear, the Dacian peasant was invested
      with the purple by the unanimous consent of the soldiers, who
      knew him to be brave and gentle, of the clergy and people, who
      believed him to be orthodox, and of the provincials, who yielded
      a blind and implicit submission to the will of the capital. The
      elder Justin, as he is distinguished from another emperor of the
      same family and name, ascended the Byzantine throne at the age of
      sixty-eight years; and, had he been left to his own guidance,
      every moment of a nine years’ reign must have exposed to his
      subjects the impropriety of their choice. His ignorance was
      similar to that of Theodoric; and it is remarkable that in an age
      not destitute of learning, two contemporary monarchs had never
      been instructed in the knowledge of the alphabet. 411 But the
      genius of Justin was far inferior to that of the Gothic king: the
      experience of a soldier had not qualified him for the government
      of an empire; and though personally brave, the consciousness of
      his own weakness was naturally attended with doubt, distrust, and
      political apprehension. But the official business of the state
      was diligently and faithfully transacted by the quaestor Proclus;
      5 and the aged emperor adopted the talents and ambition of his
      nephew Justinian, an aspiring youth, whom his uncle had drawn
      from the rustic solitude of Dacia, and educated at
      Constantinople, as the heir of his private fortune, and at length
      of the Eastern empire.

      1 (return) [ There is some difficulty in the date of his birth
      (Ludewig in Vit. Justiniani, p. 125;) none in the place—the
      district Bederiana—the village Tauresium, which he afterwards
      decorated with his name and splendor, (D’Anville, Hist. de
      l’Acad. &c., tom. xxxi. p. 287—292.)]

      2 (return) [ The names of these Dardanian peasants are Gothic,
      and almost English: Justinian is a translation of uprauda,
      (upright;) his father Sabatius (in Graeco-barbarous language
      stipes) was styled in his village Istock, (Stock;) his mother
      Bigleniza was softened into Vigilantia.]

      3 (return) [ Ludewig (p. 127—135) attempts to justify the Anician
      name of Justinian and Theodora, and to connect them with a family
      from which the house of Austria has been derived.]

      4 (return) [ See the anecdotes of Procopius, (c. 6,) with the
      notes of N. Alemannus. The satirist would not have sunk, in the
      vague and decent appellation of Zonaras. Yet why are those names
      disgraceful?—and what German baron would not be proud to descend
      from the Eumaeus of the Odyssey! Note: It is whimsical enough
      that, in our own days, we should have, even in jest, a claimant
      to lineal descent from the godlike swineherd not in the person of
      a German baron, but in that of a professor of the Ionian
      University. Constantine Koliades, or some malicious wit under
      this name, has written a tall folio to prove Ulysses to be Homer,
      and himself the descendant, the heir (?), of the Eumaeus of the
      Odyssey.—M]

      411 (return) [ St. Martin questions the fact in both cases. The
      ignorance of Justin rests on the secret history of Procopius,
      vol. viii. p. 8. St. Martin’s notes on Le Beau.—M]

      5 (return) [ His virtues are praised by Procopius, (Persic. l. i.
      c. 11.) The quaestor Proclus was the friend of Justinian, and the
      enemy of every other adoption.]

      Since the eunuch Amantius had been defrauded of his money, it
      became necessary to deprive him of his life. The task was easily
      accomplished by the charge of a real or fictitious conspiracy;
      and the judges were informed, as an accumulation of guilt, that
      he was secretly addicted to the Manichaean heresy. 6 Amantius
      lost his head; three of his companions, the first domestics of
      the palace, were punished either with death or exile; and their
      unfortunate candidate for the purple was cast into a deep
      dungeon, overwhelmed with stones, and ignominiously thrown,
      without burial, into the sea. The ruin of Vitalian was a work of
      more difficulty and danger. That Gothic chief had rendered
      himself popular by the civil war which he boldly waged against
      Anastasius for the defence of the orthodox faith, and after the
      conclusion of an advantageous treaty, he still remained in the
      neighborhood of Constantinople at the head of a formidable and
      victorious army of Barbarians. By the frail security of oaths, he
      was tempted to relinquish this advantageous situation, and to
      trust his person within the walls of a city, whose inhabitants,
      particularly the blue faction, were artfully incensed against him
      by the remembrance even of his pious hostilities. The emperor and
      his nephew embraced him as the faithful and worthy champion of
      the church and state; and gratefully adorned their favorite with
      the titles of consul and general; but in the seventh month of his
      consulship, Vitalian was stabbed with seventeen wounds at the
      royal banquet; 7 and Justinian, who inherited the spoil, was
      accused as the assassin of a spiritual brother, to whom he had
      recently pledged his faith in the participation of the Christian
      mysteries. 8 After the fall of his rival, he was promoted,
      without any claim of military service, to the office of
      master-general of the Eastern armies, whom it was his duty to
      lead into the field against the public enemy. But, in the pursuit
      of fame, Justinian might have lost his present dominion over the
      age and weakness of his uncle; and instead of acquiring by
      Scythian or Persian trophies the applause of his countrymen, 9
      the prudent warrior solicited their favor in the churches, the
      circus, and the senate, of Constantinople. The Catholics were
      attached to the nephew of Justin, who, between the Nestorian and
      Eutychian heresies, trod the narrow path of inflexible and
      intolerant orthodoxy. 10 In the first days of the new reign, he
      prompted and gratified the popular enthusiasm against the memory
      of the deceased emperor. After a schism of thirty-four years, he
      reconciled the proud and angry spirit of the Roman pontiff, and
      spread among the Latins a favorable report of his pious respect
      for the apostolic see. The thrones of the East were filled with
      Catholic bishops, devoted to his interest, the clergy and the
      monks were gained by his liberality, and the people were taught
      to pray for their future sovereign, the hope and pillar of the
      true religion. The magnificence of Justinian was displayed in the
      superior pomp of his public spectacles, an object not less sacred
      and important in the eyes of the multitude than the creed of Nice
      or Chalcedon: the expense of his consulship was esteemed at two
      hundred and twenty-eight thousand pieces of gold; twenty lions,
      and thirty leopards, were produced at the same time in the
      amphitheatre, and a numerous train of horses, with their rich
      trappings, was bestowed as an extraordinary gift on the
      victorious charioteers of the circus. While he indulged the
      people of Constantinople, and received the addresses of foreign
      kings, the nephew of Justin assiduously cultivated the friendship
      of the senate. That venerable name seemed to qualify its members
      to declare the sense of the nation, and to regulate the
      succession of the Imperial throne: the feeble Anastasius had
      permitted the vigor of government to degenerate into the form or
      substance of an aristocracy; and the military officers who had
      obtained the senatorial rank were followed by their domestic
      guards, a band of veterans, whose arms or acclamations might fix
      in a tumultuous moment the diadem of the East. The treasures of
      the state were lavished to procure the voices of the senators,
      and their unanimous wish, that he would be pleased to adopt
      Justinian for his colleague, was communicated to the emperor. But
      this request, which too clearly admonished him of his approaching
      end, was unwelcome to the jealous temper of an aged monarch,
      desirous to retain the power which he was incapable of
      exercising; and Justin, holding his purple with both his hands,
      advised them to prefer, since an election was so profitable, some
      older candidate. Not withstanding this reproach, the senate
      proceeded to decorate Justinian with the royal epithet of
      nobilissimus; and their decree was ratified by the affection or
      the fears of his uncle. After some time the languor of mind and
      body, to which he was reduced by an incurable wound in his thigh,
      indispensably required the aid of a guardian. He summoned the
      patriarch and senators; and in their presence solemnly placed the
      diadem on the head of his nephew, who was conducted from the
      palace to the circus, and saluted by the loud and joyful applause
      of the people. The life of Justin was prolonged about four
      months; but from the instant of this ceremony, he was considered
      as dead to the empire, which acknowledged Justinian, in the
      forty-fifth year of his age, for the lawful sovereign of the
      East. 11

      6 (return) [ Manichaean signifies Eutychian. Hear the furious
      acclamations of Constantinople and Tyre, the former no more than
      six days after the decease of Anastasius. They produced, the
      latter applauded, the eunuch’s death, (Baronius, A.D. 518, P. ii.
      No. 15. Fleury, Hist Eccles. tom. vii. p. 200, 205, from the
      Councils, tom. v. p. 182, 207.)]

      7 (return) [ His power, character, and intentions, are perfectly
      explained by the court de Buat, (tom. ix. p. 54—81.) He was
      great-grandson of Aspar, hereditary prince in the Lesser Scythia,
      and count of the Gothic foederati of Thrace. The Bessi, whom he
      could influence, are the minor Goths of Jornandes, (c. 51.)]

      8 (return) [ Justiniani patricii factione dicitur interfectus
      fuisse, (Victor Tu nunensis, Chron. in Thesaur. Temp. Scaliger,
      P. ii. p. 7.) Procopius (Anecdot. c. 7) styles him a tyrant, but
      acknowledges something which is well explained by Alemannus.]

      9 (return) [ In his earliest youth (plane adolescens) he had
      passed some time as a hostage with Theodoric. For this curious
      fact, Alemannus (ad Procop. Anecdot. c. 9, p. 34, of the first
      edition) quotes a Ms. history of Justinian, by his preceptor
      Theophilus. Ludewig (p. 143) wishes to make him a soldier.]

      10 (return) [ The ecclesiastical history of Justinian will be
      shown hereafter. See Baronius, A.D. 518—521, and the copious
      article Justinianas in the index to the viith volume of his
      Annals.]

      11 (return) [ The reign of the elder Justin may be found in the
      three Chronicles of Marcellinus, Victor, and John Malala, (tom.
      ii. p. 130—150,) the last of whom (in spite of Hody, Prolegom.
      No. 14, 39, edit. Oxon.) lived soon after Justinian, (Jortin’s
      Remarks, &c., vol. iv p. 383:) in the Ecclesiastical History of
      Evagrius, (l. iv. c. 1, 2, 3, 9,) and the Excerpta of Theodorus
      Lector, (No. 37,) and in Cedrenus, (p. 362—366,) and Zonaras, (l.
      xiv. p. 58—61,) who may pass for an original. * Note: Dindorf, in
      his preface to the new edition of Malala, p. vi., concurs with
      this opinion of Gibbon, which was also that of Reiske, as to the
      age of the chronicler.—M.]

      From his elevation to his death, Justinian governed the Roman
      empire thirty-eight years, seven months, and thirteen days.

      The events of his reign, which excite our curious attention by
      their number, variety, and importance, are diligently related by
      the secretary of Belisarius, a rhetorician, whom eloquence had
      promoted to the rank of senator and praefect of Constantinople.
      According to the vicissitudes of courage or servitude, of favor
      or disgrace, Procopius 12 successively composed the history, the
      panegyric, and the satire of his own times. The eight books of
      the Persian, Vandalic, and Gothic wars, 13 which are continued in
      the five books of Agathias, deserve our esteem as a laborious and
      successful imitation of the Attic, or at least of the Asiatic,
      writers of ancient Greece. His facts are collected from the
      personal experience and free conversation of a soldier, a
      statesman, and a traveller; his style continually aspires, and
      often attains, to the merit of strength and elegance; his
      reflections, more especially in the speeches, which he too
      frequently inserts, contain a rich fund of political knowledge;
      and the historian, excited by the generous ambition of pleasing
      and instructing posterity, appears to disdain the prejudices of
      the people, and the flattery of courts. The writings of Procopius
      14 were read and applauded by his contemporaries: 15 but,
      although he respectfully laid them at the foot of the throne, the
      pride of Justinian must have been wounded by the praise of a
      hero, who perpetually eclipses the glory of his inactive
      sovereign. The conscious dignity of independence was subdued by
      the hopes and fears of a slave; and the secretary of Belisarius
      labored for pardon and reward in the six books of the Imperial
      edifices. He had dexterously chosen a subject of apparent
      splendor, in which he could loudly celebrate the genius, the
      magnificence, and the piety of a prince, who, both as a conqueror
      and legislator, had surpassed the puerile virtues of Themistocles
      and Cyrus. 16 Disappointment might urge the flatterer to secret
      revenge; and the first glance of favor might again tempt him to
      suspend and suppress a libel, 17 in which the Roman Cyrus is
      degraded into an odious and contemptible tyrant, in which both
      the emperor and his consort Theodora are seriously represented as
      two daemons, who had assumed a human form for the destruction of
      mankind. 18 Such base inconsistency must doubtless sully the
      reputation, and detract from the credit, of Procopius: yet, after
      the venom of his malignity has been suffered to exhale, the
      residue of the anecdotes, even the most disgraceful facts, some
      of which had been tenderly hinted in his public history, are
      established by their internal evidence, or the authentic
      monuments of the times. 19 1911 From these various materials, I
      shall now proceed to describe the reign of Justinian, which will
      deserve and occupy an ample space. The present chapter will
      explain the elevation and character of Theodora, the factions of
      the circus, and the peaceful administration of the sovereign of
      the East. In the three succeeding chapters, I shall relate the
      wars of Justinian, which achieved the conquest of Africa and
      Italy; and I shall follow the victories of Belisarius and Narses,
      without disguising the vanity of their triumphs, or the hostile
      virtue of the Persian and Gothic heroes. The series of this and
      the following volume will embrace the jurisprudence and theology
      of the emperor; the controversies and sects which still divide
      the Oriental church; the reformation of the Roman law which is
      obeyed or respected by the nations of modern Europe.

      12 (return) [ See the characters of Procopius and Agathias in La
      Mothe le Vayer, (tom. viii. p. 144—174,) Vossius, (de Historicis
      Graecis, l. ii. c. 22,) and Fabricius, (Bibliot. Graec. l. v. c.
      5, tom. vi. p. 248—278.) Their religion, an honorable problem,
      betrays occasional conformity, with a secret attachment to
      Paganism and Philosophy.]

      13 (return) [ In the seven first books, two Persic, two Vandalic,
      and three Gothic, Procopius has borrowed from Appian the division
      of provinces and wars: the viiith book, though it bears the name
      of Gothic, is a miscellaneous and general supplement down to the
      spring of the year 553, from whence it is continued by Agathias
      till 559, (Pagi, Critica, A.D. 579, No. 5.)]

      14 (return) [ The literary fate of Procopius has been somewhat
      unlucky.

      1. His book de Bello Gothico were stolen by Leonard Aretin, and
      published (Fulginii, 1470, Venet. 1471, apud Janson. Mattaire,
      Annal Typograph. tom. i. edit. posterior, p. 290, 304, 279, 299,)
      in his own name, (see Vossius de Hist. Lat. l. iii. c. 5, and the
      feeble defence of the Venice Giornale de Letterati, tom. xix. p.
      207.)

      2. His works were mutilated by the first Latin translators,
      Christopher Persona, (Giornale, tom. xix. p. 340—348,) and
      Raphael de Volaterra, (Huet, de Claris Interpretibus, p. 166,)
      who did not even consult the Ms. of the Vatican library, of which
      they were praefects, (Aleman. in Praefat Anecdot.) 3. The Greek
      text was not printed till 1607, by Hoeschelius of Augsburg,
      (Dictionnaire de Bayle, tom. ii. p. 782.)

      4. The Paris edition was imperfectly executed by Claude Maltret,
      a Jesuit of Toulouse, (in 1663,) far distant from the Louvre
      press and the Vatican Ms., from which, however, he obtained some
      supplements. His promised commentaries, &c., have never appeared.
      The Agathias of Leyden (1594) has been wisely reprinted by the
      Paris editor, with the Latin version of Bonaventura Vulcanius, a
      learned interpreter, (Huet, p. 176.)

      * Note: Procopius forms a part of the new Byzantine collection
      under the superintendence of Dindorf.—M.]

      15 (return) [ Agathias in Praefat. p. 7, 8, l. iv. p. 137.
      Evagrius, l. iv. c. 12. See likewise Photius, cod. lxiii. p. 65.]

      16 (return) [ Says, he, Praefat. ad l. de Edificiis is no more
      than a pun! In these five books, Procopius affects a Christian as
      well as a courtly style.]

      17 (return) [ Procopius discloses himself, (Praefat. ad Anecdot.
      c. 1, 2, 5,) and the anecdotes are reckoned as the ninth book by
      Suidas, (tom. iii. p. 186, edit. Kuster.) The silence of Evagrius
      is a poor objection. Baronius (A.D. 548, No. 24) regrets the loss
      of this secret history: it was then in the Vatican library, in
      his own custody, and was first published sixteen years after his
      death, with the learned, but partial notes of Nicholas Alemannus,
      (Lugd. 1623.)]

      18 (return) [ Justinian an ass—the perfect likeness of
      Domitian—Anecdot. c. 8.—Theodora’s lovers driven from her bed by
      rival daemons—her marriage foretold with a great daemon—a monk
      saw the prince of the daemons, instead of Justinian, on the
      throne—the servants who watched beheld a face without features, a
      body walking without a head, &c., &c. Procopius declares his own
      and his friends’ belief in these diabolical stories, (c. 12.)]

      19 (return) [ Montesquieu (Considerations sur la Grandeur et la
      Decadence des Romains, c. xx.) gives credit to these anecdotes,
      as connected, 1. with the weakness of the empire, and, 2. with
      the instability of Justinian’s laws.]

      1911 (return) [ The Anecdota of Procopius, compared with the
      former works of the same author, appear to me the basest and most
      disgraceful work in literature. The wars, which he has described
      in the former volumes as glorious or necessary, are become
      unprofitable and wanton massacres; the buildings which he
      celebrated, as raised to the immortal honor of the great emperor,
      and his admirable queen, either as magnificent embellishments of
      the city, or useful fortifications for the defence of the
      frontier, are become works of vain prodigality and useless
      ostentation. I doubt whether Gibbon has made sufficient allowance
      for the “malignity” of the Anecdota; at all events, the extreme
      and disgusting profligacy of Theodora’s early life rests entirely
      on this viratent libel—M.]

      I. In the exercise of supreme power, the first act of Justinian
      was to divide it with the woman whom he loved, the famous
      Theodora, 20 whose strange elevation cannot be applauded as the
      triumph of female virtue. Under the reign of Anastasius, the care
      of the wild beasts maintained by the green faction at
      Constantinople was intrusted to Acacius, a native of the Isle of
      Cyprus, who, from his employment, was surnamed the master of the
      bears. This honorable office was given after his death to another
      candidate, notwithstanding the diligence of his widow, who had
      already provided a husband and a successor. Acacius had left
      three daughters, Comito, 21 Theodora, and Anastasia, the eldest
      of whom did not then exceed the age of seven years. On a solemn
      festival, these helpless orphans were sent by their distressed
      and indignant mother, in the garb of suppliants, into the midst
      of the theatre: the green faction received them with contempt,
      the blues with compassion; and this difference, which sunk deep
      into the mind of Theodora, was felt long afterwards in the
      administration of the empire. As they improved in age and beauty,
      the three sisters were successively devoted to the public and
      private pleasures of the Byzantine people: and Theodora, after
      following Comito on the stage, in the dress of a slave, with a
      stool on her head, was at length permitted to exercise her
      independent talents. She neither danced, nor sung, nor played on
      the flute; her skill was confined to the pantomime arts; she
      excelled in buffoon characters, and as often as the comedian
      swelled her cheeks, and complained with a ridiculous tone and
      gesture of the blows that were inflicted, the whole theatre of
      Constantinople resounded with laughter and applause. The beauty
      of Theodora 22 was the subject of more flattering praise, and the
      source of more exquisite delight. Her features were delicate and
      regular; her complexion, though somewhat pale, was tinged with a
      natural color; every sensation was instantly expressed by the
      vivacity of her eyes; her easy motions displayed the graces of a
      small but elegant figure; and either love or adulation might
      proclaim, that painting and poetry were incapable of delineating
      the matchless excellence of her form. But this form was degraded
      by the facility with which it was exposed to the public eye, and
      prostituted to licentious desire. Her venal charms were abandoned
      to a promiscuous crowd of citizens and strangers of every rank,
      and of every profession: the fortunate lover who had been
      promised a night of enjoyment, was often driven from her bed by a
      stronger or more wealthy favorite; and when she passed through
      the streets, her presence was avoided by all who wished to escape
      either the scandal or the temptation. The satirical historian has
      not blushed 23 to describe the naked scenes which Theodora was
      not ashamed to exhibit in the theatre. 24 After exhausting the
      arts of sensual pleasure, 25 she most ungratefully murmured
      against the parsimony of Nature; 26 but her murmurs, her
      pleasures, and her arts, must be veiled in the obscurity of a
      learned language. After reigning for some time, the delight and
      contempt of the capital, she condescended to accompany Ecebolus,
      a native of Tyre, who had obtained the government of the African
      Pentapolis. But this union was frail and transient; Ecebolus soon
      rejected an expensive or faithless concubine; she was reduced at
      Alexandria to extreme distress; and in her laborious return to
      Constantinople, every city of the East admired and enjoyed the
      fair Cyprian, whose merit appeared to justify her descent from
      the peculiar island of Venus. The vague commerce of Theodora, and
      the most detestable precautions, preserved her from the danger
      which she feared; yet once, and once only, she became a mother.
      The infant was saved and educated in Arabia, by his father, who
      imparted to him on his death-bed, that he was the son of an
      empress. Filled with ambitious hopes, the unsuspecting youth
      immediately hastened to the palace of Constantinople, and was
      admitted to the presence of his mother. As he was never more
      seen, even after the decease of Theodora, she deserves the foul
      imputation of extinguishing with his life a secret so offensive
      to her Imperial virtue. 2611

      In the most abject state of her fortune, and reputation, some
      vision, either of sleep or of fancy, had whispered to Theodora
      the pleasing assurance that she was destined to become the spouse
      of a potent monarch. Conscious of her approaching greatness, she
      returned from Paphlagonia to Constantinople; assumed, like a
      skilful actress, a more decent character; relieved her poverty by
      the laudable industry of spinning wool; and affected a life of
      chastity and solitude in a small house, which she afterwards
      changed into a magnificent temple. 27 Her beauty, assisted by art
      or accident, soon attracted, captivated, and fixed, the patrician
      Justinian, who already reigned with absolute sway under the name
      of his uncle. Perhaps she contrived to enhance the value of a
      gift which she had so often lavished on the meanest of mankind;
      perhaps she inflamed, at first by modest delays, and at last by
      sensual allurements, the desires of a lover, who, from nature or
      devotion, was addicted to long vigils and abstemious diet. When
      his first transports had subsided, she still maintained the same
      ascendant over his mind, by the more solid merit of temper and
      understanding. Justinian delighted to ennoble and enrich the
      object of his affection; the treasures of the East were poured at
      her feet, and the nephew of Justin was determined, perhaps by
      religious scruples, to bestow on his concubine the sacred and
      legal character of a wife. But the laws of Rome expressly
      prohibited the marriage of a senator with any female who had been
      dishonored by a servile origin or theatrical profession: the
      empress Lupicina, or Euphemia, a Barbarian of rustic manners, but
      of irreproachable virtue, refused to accept a prostitute for her
      niece; and even Vigilantia, the superstitious mother of
      Justinian, though she acknowledged the wit and beauty of
      Theodora, was seriously apprehensive, lest the levity and
      arrogance of that artful paramour might corrupt the piety and
      happiness of her son. These obstacles were removed by the
      inflexible constancy of Justinian. He patiently expected the
      death of the empress; he despised the tears of his mother, who
      soon sunk under the weight of her affliction; and a law was
      promulgated in the name of the emperor Justin, which abolished
      the rigid jurisprudence of antiquity. A glorious repentance (the
      words of the edict) was left open for the unhappy females who had
      prostituted their persons on the theatre, and they were permitted
      to contract a legal union with the most illustrious of the
      Romans. 28 This indulgence was speedily followed by the solemn
      nuptials of Justinian and Theodora; her dignity was gradually
      exalted with that of her lover, and, as soon as Justin had
      invested his nephew with the purple, the patriarch of
      Constantinople placed the diadem on the heads of the emperor and
      empress of the East. But the usual honors which the severity of
      Roman manners had allowed to the wives of princes, could not
      satisfy either the ambition of Theodora or the fondness of
      Justinian. He seated her on the throne as an equal and
      independent colleague in the sovereignty of the empire, and an
      oath of allegiance was imposed on the governors of the provinces
      in the joint names of Justinian and Theodora. 29 The Eastern
      world fell prostrate before the genius and fortune of the
      daughter of Acacius. The prostitute who, in the presence of
      innumerable spectators, had polluted the theatre of
      Constantinople, was adored as a queen in the same city, by grave
      magistrates, orthodox bishops, victorious generals, and captive
      monarchs. 30

      Chapter XL: Reign Of Justinian.—Part II.

      Those who believe that the female mind is totally depraved by the
      loss of chastity, will eagerly listen to all the invectives of
      private envy, or popular resentment which have dissembled the
      virtues of Theodora, exaggerated her vices, and condemned with
      rigor the venal or voluntary sins of the youthful harlot. From a
      motive of shame, or contempt, she often declined the servile
      homage of the multitude, escaped from the odious light of the
      capital, and passed the greatest part of the year in the palaces
      and gardens which were pleasantly seated on the sea-coast of the
      Propontis and the Bosphorus. Her private hours were devoted to
      the prudent as well as grateful care of her beauty, the luxury of
      the bath and table, and the long slumber of the evening and the
      morning. Her secret apartments were occupied by the favorite
      women and eunuchs, whose interests and passions she indulged at
      the expense of justice; the most illustrious personages of the
      state were crowded into a dark and sultry antechamber, and when
      at last, after tedious attendance, they were admitted to kiss the
      feet of Theodora, they experienced, as her humor might suggest,
      the silent arrogance of an empress, or the capricious levity of a
      comedian. Her rapacious avarice to accumulate an immense
      treasure, may be excused by the apprehension of her husband’s
      death, which could leave no alternative between ruin and the
      throne; and fear as well as ambition might exasperate Theodora
      against two generals, who, during the malady of the emperor, had
      rashly declared that they were not disposed to acquiesce in the
      choice of the capital. But the reproach of cruelty, so repugnant
      even to her softer vices, has left an indelible stain on the
      memory of Theodora. Her numerous spies observed, and zealously
      reported, every action, or word, or look, injurious to their
      royal mistress. Whomsoever they accused were cast into her
      peculiar prisons, 31 inaccessible to the inquiries of justice;
      and it was rumored, that the torture of the rack, or scourge, had
      been inflicted in the presence of the female tyrant, insensible
      to the voice of prayer or of pity. 32 Some of these unhappy
      victims perished in deep, unwholesome dungeons, while others were
      permitted, after the loss of their limbs, their reason, or their
      fortunes, to appear in the world, the living monuments of her
      vengeance, which was commonly extended to the children of those
      whom she had suspected or injured. The senator or bishop, whose
      death or exile Theodora had pronounced, was delivered to a trusty
      messenger, and his diligence was quickened by a menace from her
      own mouth. “If you fail in the execution of my commands, I swear
      by Him who liveth forever, that your skin shall be flayed from
      your body.” 33

      If the creed of Theodora had not been tainted with heresy, her
      exemplary devotion might have atoned, in the opinion of her
      contemporaries, for pride, avarice, and cruelty. But, if she
      employed her influence to assuage the intolerant fury of the
      emperor, the present age will allow some merit to her religion,
      and much indulgence to her speculative errors. 34 The name of
      Theodora was introduced, with equal honor, in all the pious and
      charitable foundations of Justinian; and the most benevolent
      institution of his reign may be ascribed to the sympathy of the
      empress for her less fortunate sisters, who had been seduced or
      compelled to embrace the trade of prostitution. A palace, on the
      Asiatic side of the Bosphorus, was converted into a stately and
      spacious monastery, and a liberal maintenance was assigned to
      five hundred women, who had been collected from the streets and
      brothels of Constantinople. In this safe and holy retreat, they
      were devoted to perpetual confinement; and the despair of some,
      who threw themselves headlong into the sea, was lost in the
      gratitude of the penitents, who had been delivered from sin and
      misery by their generous benefactress. 35 The prudence of
      Theodora is celebrated by Justinian himself; and his laws are
      attributed to the sage counsels of his most reverend wife whom he
      had received as the gift of the Deity. 36 Her courage was
      displayed amidst the tumult of the people and the terrors of the
      court. Her chastity, from the moment of her union with Justinian,
      is founded on the silence of her implacable enemies; and although
      the daughter of Acacius might be satiated with love, yet some
      applause is due to the firmness of a mind which could sacrifice
      pleasure and habit to the stronger sense either of duty or
      interest. The wishes and prayers of Theodora could never obtain
      the blessing of a lawful son, and she buried an infant daughter,
      the sole offspring of her marriage. 37 Notwithstanding this
      disappointment, her dominion was permanent and absolute; she
      preserved, by art or merit, the affections of Justinian; and
      their seeming dissensions were always fatal to the courtiers who
      believed them to be sincere. Perhaps her health had been impaired
      by the licentiousness of her youth; but it was always delicate,
      and she was directed by her physicians to use the Pythian warm
      baths. In this journey, the empress was followed by the
      Praetorian praefect, the great treasurer, several counts and
      patricians, and a splendid train of four thousand attendants: the
      highways were repaired at her approach; a palace was erected for
      her reception; and as she passed through Bithynia, she
      distributed liberal alms to the churches, the monasteries, and
      the hospitals, that they might implore Heaven for the restoration
      of her health. 38 At length, in the twenty-fourth year of her
      marriage, and the twenty-second of her reign, she was consumed by
      a cancer; 39 and the irreparable loss was deplored by her
      husband, who, in the room of a theatrical prostitute, might have
      selected the purest and most noble virgin of the East. 40

      Theophanes as civil language, which does not imply either piety
      or repentance; yet two years after her death, St. Theodora is
      celebrated by Paul Silentiarius, (in proem. v. 58—62.)]

      II. A material difference may be observed in the games of
      antiquity: the most eminent of the Greeks were actors, the Romans
      were merely spectators. The Olympic stadium was open to wealth,
      merit, and ambition; and if the candidates could depend on their
      personal skill and activity, they might pursue the footsteps of
      Diomede and Menelaus, and conduct their own horses in the rapid
      career. 41 Ten, twenty, forty chariots were allowed to start at
      the same instant; a crown of leaves was the reward of the victor;
      and his fame, with that of his family and country, was chanted in
      lyric strains more durable than monuments of brass and marble.
      But a senator, or even a citizen, conscious of his dignity, would
      have blushed to expose his person, or his horses, in the circus
      of Rome. The games were exhibited at the expense of the republic,
      the magistrates, or the emperors: but the reins were abandoned to
      servile hands; and if the profits of a favorite charioteer
      sometimes exceeded those of an advocate, they must be considered
      as the effects of popular extravagance, and the high wages of a
      disgraceful profession. The race, in its first institution, was a
      simple contest of two chariots, whose drivers were distinguished
      by white and red liveries: two additional colors, a light green,
      and a caerulean blue, were afterwards introduced; and as the
      races were repeated twenty-five times, one hundred chariots
      contributed in the same day to the pomp of the circus. The four
      factions soon acquired a legal establishment, and a mysterious
      origin, and their fanciful colors were derived from the various
      appearances of nature in the four seasons of the year; the red
      dogstar of summer, the snows of winter, the deep shades of
      autumn, and the cheerful verdure of the spring. 42 Another
      interpretation preferred the elements to the seasons, and the
      struggle of the green and blue was supposed to represent the
      conflict of the earth and sea. Their respective victories
      announced either a plentiful harvest or a prosperous navigation,
      and the hostility of the husbandmen and mariners was somewhat
      less absurd than the blind ardor of the Roman people, who devoted
      their lives and fortunes to the color which they had espoused.
      Such folly was disdained and indulged by the wisest princes; but
      the names of Caligula, Nero, Vitellius, Verus, Commodus,
      Caracalla, and Elagabalus, were enrolled in the blue or green
      factions of the circus; they frequented their stables, applauded
      their favorites, chastised their antagonists, and deserved the
      esteem of the populace, by the natural or affected imitation of
      their manners. The bloody and tumultuous contest continued to
      disturb the public festivity, till the last age of the spectacles
      of Rome; and Theodoric, from a motive of justice or affection,
      interposed his authority to protect the greens against the
      violence of a consul and a patrician, who were passionately
      addicted to the blue faction of the circus. 43

      translated white, red, and green. Venetus is explained by
      coeruleus, a word various and vague: it is properly the sky
      reflected in the sea; but custom and convenience may allow blue
      as an equivalent, (Robert. Stephan. sub voce. Spence’s Polymetis,

      Constantinople adopted the follies, though not the virtues, of
      ancient Rome; and the same factions which had agitated the
      circus, raged with redoubled fury in the hippodrome. Under the
      reign of Anastasius, this popular frenzy was inflamed by
      religious zeal; and the greens, who had treacherously concealed
      stones and daggers under baskets of fruit, massacred, at a solemn
      festival, three thousand of their blue adversaries. 44 From this
      capital, the pestilence was diffused into the provinces and
      cities of the East, and the sportive distinction of two colors
      produced two strong and irreconcilable factions, which shook the
      foundations of a feeble government. 45 The popular dissensions,
      founded on the most serious interest, or holy pretence, have
      scarcely equalled the obstinacy of this wanton discord, which
      invaded the peace of families, divided friends and brothers, and
      tempted the female sex, though seldom seen in the circus, to
      espouse the inclinations of their lovers, or to contradict the
      wishes of their husbands. Every law, either human or divine, was
      trampled under foot, and as long as the party was successful, its
      deluded followers appeared careless of private distress or public
      calamity. The license, without the freedom, of democracy, was
      revived at Antioch and Constantinople, and the support of a
      faction became necessary to every candidate for civil or
      ecclesiastical honors. A secret attachment to the family or sect
      of Anastasius was imputed to the greens; the blues were zealously
      devoted to the cause of orthodoxy and Justinian, 46 and their
      grateful patron protected, above five years, the disorders of a
      faction, whose seasonable tumults overawed the palace, the
      senate, and the capitals of the East. Insolent with royal favor,
      the blues affected to strike terror by a peculiar and Barbaric
      dress, the long hair of the Huns, their close sleeves and ample
      garments, a lofty step, and a sonorous voice. In the day they
      concealed their two-edged poniards, but in the night they boldly
      assembled in arms, and in numerous bands, prepared for every act
      of violence and rapine. Their adversaries of the green faction,
      or even inoffensive citizens, were stripped and often murdered by
      these nocturnal robbers, and it became dangerous to wear any gold
      buttons or girdles, or to appear at a late hour in the streets of
      a peaceful capital. A daring spirit, rising with impunity,
      proceeded to violate the safeguard of private houses; and fire
      was employed to facilitate the attack, or to conceal the crimes
      of these factious rioters. No place was safe or sacred from their
      depredations; to gratify either avarice or revenge, they
      profusely spilt the blood of the innocent; churches and altars
      were polluted by atrocious murders; and it was the boast of the
      assassins, that their dexterity could always inflict a mortal
      wound with a single stroke of their dagger. The dissolute youth
      of Constantinople adopted the blue livery of disorder; the laws
      were silent, and the bonds of society were relaxed: creditors
      were compelled to resign their obligations; judges to reverse
      their sentence; masters to enfranchise their slaves; fathers to
      supply the extravagance of their children; noble matrons were
      prostituted to the lust of their servants; beautiful boys were
      torn from the arms of their parents; and wives, unless they
      preferred a voluntary death, were ravished in the presence of
      their husbands. 47 The despair of the greens, who were persecuted
      by their enemies, and deserted by the magistrates, assumed the
      privilege of defence, perhaps of retaliation; but those who
      survived the combat were dragged to execution, and the unhappy
      fugitives, escaping to woods and caverns, preyed without mercy on
      the society from whence they were expelled. Those ministers of
      justice who had courage to punish the crimes, and to brave the
      resentment, of the blues, became the victims of their indiscreet
      zeal; a praefect of Constantinople fled for refuge to the holy
      sepulchre, a count of the East was ignominiously whipped, and a
      governor of Cilicia was hanged, by the order of Theodora, on the
      tomb of two assassins whom he had condemned for the murder of his
      groom, and a daring attack upon his own life. 48 An aspiring
      candidate may be tempted to build his greatness on the public
      confusion, but it is the interest as well as duty of a sovereign
      to maintain the authority of the laws. The first edict of
      Justinian, which was often repeated, and sometimes executed,
      announced his firm resolution to support the innocent, and to
      chastise the guilty, of every denomination and color. Yet the
      balance of justice was still inclined in favor of the blue
      faction, by the secret affection, the habits, and the fears of
      the emperor; his equity, after an apparent struggle, submitted,
      without reluctance, to the implacable passions of Theodora, and
      the empress never forgot, or forgave, the injuries of the
      comedian. At the accession of the younger Justin, the
      proclamation of equal and rigorous justice indirectly condemned
      the partiality of the former reign. “Ye blues, Justinian is no
      more! ye greens, he is still alive!” 49

      Aleman. Praefat. p. 6.]

      A sedition, which almost laid Constantinople in ashes, was
      excited by the mutual hatred and momentary reconciliation of the
      two factions. In the fifth year of his reign, Justinian
      celebrated the festival of the ides of January; the games were
      incessantly disturbed by the clamorous discontent of the greens:
      till the twenty-second race, the emperor maintained his silent
      gravity; at length, yielding to his impatience, he condescended
      to hold, in abrupt sentences, and by the voice of a crier, the
      most singular dialogue 50 that ever passed between a prince and
      his subjects. Their first complaints were respectful and modest;
      they accused the subordinate ministers of oppression, and
      proclaimed their wishes for the long life and victory of the
      emperor. “Be patient and attentive, ye insolent railers!”
      exclaimed Justinian; “be mute, ye Jews, Samaritans, and
      Manichaeans!” The greens still attempted to awaken his
      compassion. “We are poor, we are innocent, we are injured, we
      dare not pass through the streets: a general persecution is
      exercised against our name and color. Let us die, O emperor! but
      let us die by your command, and for your service!” But the
      repetition of partial and passionate invectives degraded, in
      their eyes, the majesty of the purple; they renounced allegiance
      to the prince who refused justice to his people; lamented that
      the father of Justinian had been born; and branded his son with
      the opprobrious names of a homicide, an ass, and a perjured
      tyrant. “Do you despise your lives?” cried the indignant monarch:
      the blues rose with fury from their seats; their hostile clamors
      thundered in the hippodrome; and their adversaries, deserting the
      unequal contest spread terror and despair through the streets of
      Constantinople. At this dangerous moment, seven notorious
      assassins of both factions, who had been condemned by the
      praefect, were carried round the city, and afterwards transported
      to the place of execution in the suburb of Pera. Four were
      immediately beheaded; a fifth was hanged: but when the same
      punishment was inflicted on the remaining two, the rope broke,
      they fell alive to the ground, the populace applauded their
      escape, and the monks of St. Conon, issuing from the neighboring
      convent, conveyed them in a boat to the sanctuary of the church.
      51 As one of these criminals was of the blue, and the other of
      the green livery, the two factions were equally provoked by the
      cruelty of their oppressor, or the ingratitude of their patron;
      and a short truce was concluded till they had delivered their
      prisoners and satisfied their revenge. The palace of the
      praefect, who withstood the seditious torrent, was instantly
      burnt, his officers and guards were massacred, the prisons were
      forced open, and freedom was restored to those who could only use
      it for the public destruction. A military force, which had been
      despatched to the aid of the civil magistrate, was fiercely
      encountered by an armed multitude, whose numbers and boldness
      continually increased; and the Heruli, the wildest Barbarians in
      the service of the empire, overturned the priests and their
      relics, which, from a pious motive, had been rashly interposed to
      separate the bloody conflict. The tumult was exasperated by this
      sacrilege, the people fought with enthusiasm in the cause of God;
      the women, from the roofs and windows, showered stones on the
      heads of the soldiers, who darted fire brands against the houses;
      and the various flames, which had been kindled by the hands of
      citizens and strangers, spread without control over the face of
      the city. The conflagration involved the cathedral of St. Sophia,
      the baths of Zeuxippus, a part of the palace, from the first
      entrance to the altar of Mars, and the long portico from the
      palace to the forum of Constantine: a large hospital, with the
      sick patients, was consumed; many churches and stately edifices
      were destroyed and an immense treasure of gold and silver was
      either melted or lost. From such scenes of horror and distress,
      the wise and wealthy citizens escaped over the Bosphorus to the
      Asiatic side; and during five days Constantinople was abandoned
      to the factions, whose watchword, Nika, vanquish! has given a
      name to this memorable sedition. 52

      61—63.)]

      As long as the factions were divided, the triumphant blues, and
      desponding greens, appeared to behold with the same indifference
      the disorders of the state. They agreed to censure the corrupt
      management of justice and the finance; and the two responsible
      ministers, the artful Tribonian, and the rapacious John of
      Cappadocia, were loudly arraigned as the authors of the public
      misery. The peaceful murmurs of the people would have been
      disregarded: they were heard with respect when the city was in
      flames; the quaestor, and the praefect, were instantly removed,
      and their offices were filled by two senators of blameless
      integrity. After this popular concession, Justinian proceeded to
      the hippodrome to confess his own errors, and to accept the
      repentance of his grateful subjects; but they distrusted his
      assurances, though solemnly pronounced in the presence of the
      holy Gospels; and the emperor, alarmed by their distrust,
      retreated with precipitation to the strong fortress of the
      palace. The obstinacy of the tumult was now imputed to a secret
      and ambitious conspiracy, and a suspicion was entertained, that
      the insurgents, more especially the green faction, had been
      supplied with arms and money by Hypatius and Pompey, two
      patricians, who could neither forget with honor, nor remember
      with safety, that they were the nephews of the emperor
      Anastasius. Capriciously trusted, disgraced, and pardoned, by the
      jealous levity of the monarch, they had appeared as loyal
      servants before the throne; and, during five days of the tumult,
      they were detained as important hostages; till at length, the
      fears of Justinian prevailing over his prudence, he viewed the
      two brothers in the light of spies, perhaps of assassins, and
      sternly commanded them to depart from the palace. After a
      fruitless representation, that obedience might lead to
      involuntary treason, they retired to their houses, and in the
      morning of the sixth day, Hypatius was surrounded and seized by
      the people, who, regardless of his virtuous resistance, and the
      tears of his wife, transported their favorite to the forum of
      Constantine, and instead of a diadem, placed a rich collar on his
      head. If the usurper, who afterwards pleaded the merit of his
      delay, had complied with the advice of his senate, and urged the
      fury of the multitude, their first irresistible effort might have
      oppressed or expelled his trembling competitor. The Byzantine
      palace enjoyed a free communication with the sea; vessels lay
      ready at the garden stairs; and a secret resolution was already
      formed, to convey the emperor with his family and treasures to a
      safe retreat, at some distance from the capital.

      Justinian was lost, if the prostitute whom he raised from the
      theatre had not renounced the timidity, as well as the virtues,
      of her sex. In the midst of a council, where Belisarius was
      present, Theodora alone displayed the spirit of a hero; and she
      alone, without apprehending his future hatred, could save the
      emperor from the imminent danger, and his unworthy fears. “If
      flight,” said the consort of Justinian, “were the only means of
      safety, yet I should disdain to fly. Death is the condition of
      our birth; but they who have reigned should never survive the
      loss of dignity and dominion. I implore Heaven, that I may never
      be seen, not a day, without my diadem and purple; that I may no
      longer behold the light, when I cease to be saluted with the name
      of queen. If you resolve, O Caesar! to fly, you have treasures;
      behold the sea, you have ships; but tremble lest the desire of
      life should expose you to wretched exile and ignominious death.
      For my own part, I adhere to the maxim of antiquity, that the
      throne is a glorious sepulchre.” The firmness of a woman restored
      the courage to deliberate and act, and courage soon discovers the
      resources of the most desperate situation. It was an easy and a
      decisive measure to revive the animosity of the factions; the
      blues were astonished at their own guilt and folly, that a
      trifling injury should provoke them to conspire with their
      implacable enemies against a gracious and liberal benefactor;
      they again proclaimed the majesty of Justinian; and the greens,
      with their upstart emperor, were left alone in the hippodrome.
      The fidelity of the guards was doubtful; but the military force
      of Justinian consisted in three thousand veterans, who had been
      trained to valor and discipline in the Persian and Illyrian wars.

      Under the command of Belisarius and Mundus, they silently marched
      in two divisions from the palace, forced their obscure way
      through narrow passages, expiring flames, and falling edifices,
      and burst open at the same moment the two opposite gates of the
      hippodrome. In this narrow space, the disorderly and affrighted
      crowd was incapable of resisting on either side a firm and
      regular attack; the blues signalized the fury of their
      repentance; and it is computed, that above thirty thousand
      persons were slain in the merciless and promiscuous carnage of
      the day. Hypatius was dragged from his throne, and conducted,
      with his brother Pompey, to the feet of the emperor: they
      implored his clemency; but their crime was manifest, their
      innocence uncertain, and Justinian had been too much terrified to
      forgive. The next morning the two nephews of Anastasius, with
      eighteen illustrious accomplices, of patrician or consular rank,
      were privately executed by the soldiers; their bodies were thrown
      into the sea, their palaces razed, and their fortunes
      confiscated. The hippodrome itself was condemned, during several
      years, to a mournful silence: with the restoration of the games,
      the same disorders revived; and the blue and green factions
      continued to afflict the reign of Justinian, and to disturb the
      tranquility of the Eastern empire. 53

      53 (return) [ Marcellinus says in general terms, innumeris
      populis in circotrucidatis. Procopius numbers 30,000 victims: and

      Zonaras. Such is the usual progress of exaggeration.]

      III. That empire, after Rome was barbarous, still embraced the
      nations whom she had conquered beyond the Adriatic, and as far as
      the frontiers of Aethiopia and Persia. Justinian reigned over
      sixty-four provinces, and nine hundred and thirty-five cities; 54
      his dominions were blessed by nature with the advantages of soil,
      situation, and climate: and the improvements of human art had
      been perpetually diffused along the coast of the Mediterranean
      and the banks of the Nile from ancient Troy to the Egyptian
      Thebes. Abraham 55 had been relieved by the well-known plenty of
      Egypt; the same country, a small and populous tract, was still
      capable of exporting, each year, two hundred and sixty thousand
      quarters of wheat for the use of Constantinople; 56 and the
      capital of Justinian was supplied with the manufactures of Sidon,
      fifteen centuries after they had been celebrated in the poems of
      Homer. 57 The annual powers of vegetation, instead of being
      exhausted by two thousand harvests, were renewed and invigorated
      by skilful husbandry, rich manure, and seasonable repose. The
      breed of domestic animals was infinitely multiplied. Plantations,
      buildings, and the instruments of labor and luxury, which are
      more durable than the term of human life, were accumulated by the
      care of successive generations. Tradition preserved, and
      experience simplified, the humble practice of the arts: society
      was enriched by the division of labor and the facility of
      exchange; and every Roman was lodged, clothed, and subsisted, by
      the industry of a thousand hands. The invention of the loom and
      distaff has been piously ascribed to the gods. In every age, a
      variety of animal and vegetable productions, hair, skins, wool,
      flax, cotton, and at length silk, have been skilfully
      manufactured to hide or adorn the human body; they were stained
      with an infusion of permanent colors; and the pencil was
      successfully employed to improve the labors of the loom. In the
      choice of those colors 58 which imitate the beauties of nature,
      the freedom of taste and fashion was indulged; but the deep
      purple 59 which the Phoenicians extracted from a shell-fish, was
      restrained to the sacred person and palace of the emperor; and
      the penalties of treason were denounced against the ambitious
      subjects who dared to usurp the prerogative of the throne. 60

      Chapter XL: Reign Of Justinian.—Part III.

      I need not explain that silk 61 is originally spun from the
      bowels of a caterpillar, and that it composes the golden tomb,
      from whence a worm emerges in the form of a butterfly. Till the
      reign of Justinian, the silk-worm who feed on the leaves of the
      white mulberry-tree were confined to China; those of the pine,
      the oak, and the ash, were common in the forests both of Asia and
      Europe; but as their education is more difficult, and their
      produce more uncertain, they were generally neglected, except in
      the little island of Ceos, near the coast of Attica. A thin gauze
      was procured from their webs, and this Cean manufacture, the
      invention of a woman, for female use, was long admired both in
      the East and at Rome. Whatever suspicions may be raised by the
      garments of the Medes and Assyrians, Virgil is the most ancient
      writer, who expressly mentions the soft wool which was combed
      from the trees of the Seres or Chinese; 62 and this natural
      error, less marvellous than the truth, was slowly corrected by
      the knowledge of a valuable insect, the first artificer of the
      luxury of nations. That rare and elegant luxury was censured, in
      the reign of Tiberius, by the gravest of the Romans; and Pliny,
      in affected though forcible language, has condemned the thirst of
      gain, which explores the last confines of the earth, for the
      pernicious purpose of exposing to the public eye naked draperies
      and transparent matrons. 63 6311 A dress which showed the turn of
      the limbs, and color of the skin, might gratify vanity, or
      provoke desire; the silks which had been closely woven in China
      were sometimes unravelled by the Phoenician women, and the
      precious materials were multiplied by a looser texture, and the
      intermixture of linen threads. 64 Two hundred years after the age
      of Pliny, the use of pure, or even of mixed silks, was confined
      to the female sex, till the opulent citizens of Rome and the
      provinces were insensibly familiarized with the example of
      Elagabalus, the first who, by this effeminate habit, had sullied
      the dignity of an emperor and a man. Aurelian complained, that a
      pound of silk was sold at Rome for twelve ounces of gold; but the
      supply increased with the demand, and the price diminished with
      the supply. If accident or monopoly sometimes raised the value
      even above the standard of Aurelian, the manufacturers of Tyre
      and Berytus were sometimes compelled, by the operation of the
      same causes, to content themselves with a ninth part of that
      extravagant rate. 65 A law was thought necessary to discriminate
      the dress of comedians from that of senators; and of the silk
      exported from its native country the far greater part was
      consumed by the subjects of Justinian. They were still more
      intimately acquainted with a shell-fish of the Mediterranean,
      surnamed the silk-worm of the sea: the fine wool or hair by which
      the mother-of-pearl affixes itself to the rock is now
      manufactured for curiosity rather than use; and a robe obtained
      from the same singular materials was the gift of the Roman
      emperor to the satraps of Armenia. 66

      A valuable merchandise of small bulk is capable of defraying the
      expense of land-carriage; and the caravans traversed the whole
      latitude of Asia in two hundred and forty-three days from the
      Chinese Ocean to the sea-coast of Syria. Silk was immediately
      delivered to the Romans by the Persian merchants, 67 who
      frequented the fairs of Armenia and Nisibis; but this trade,
      which in the intervals of truce was oppressed by avarice and
      jealousy, was totally interrupted by the long wars of the rival
      monarchies. The great king might proudly number Sogdiana, and
      even Serica, among the provinces of his empire; but his real
      dominion was bounded by the Oxus and his useful intercourse with
      the Sogdoites, beyond the river, depended on the pleasure of
      their conquerors, the white Huns, and the Turks, who successively
      reigned over that industrious people. Yet the most savage
      dominion has not extirpated the seeds of agriculture and
      commerce, in a region which is celebrated as one of the four
      gardens of Asia; the cities of Samarcand and Bochara are
      advantageously seated for the exchange of its various
      productions; and their merchants purchased from the Chinese, 68
      the raw or manufactured silk which they transported into Persia
      for the use of the Roman empire. In the vain capital of China,
      the Sogdian caravans were entertained as the suppliant embassies
      of tributary kingdoms, and if they returned in safety, the bold
      adventure was rewarded with exorbitant gain. But the difficult
      and perilous march from Samarcand to the first town of Shensi,
      could not be performed in less than sixty, eighty, or one hundred
      days: as soon as they had passed the Jaxartes they entered the
      desert; and the wandering hordes, unless they are restrained by
      armies and garrisons, have always considered the citizen and the
      traveller as the objects of lawful rapine. To escape the Tartar
      robbers, and the tyrants of Persia, the silk caravans explored a
      more southern road; they traversed the mountains of Thibet,
      descended the streams of the Ganges or the Indus, and patiently
      expected, in the ports of Guzerat and Malabar, the annual fleets
      of the West. 69 But the dangers of the desert were found less
      intolerable than toil, hunger, and the loss of time; the attempt
      was seldom renewed, and the only European who has passed that
      unfrequented way, applauds his own diligence, that, in nine
      months after his departure from Pekin, he reached the mouth of
      the Indus. The ocean, however, was open to the free communication
      of mankind. From the great river to the tropic of Cancer, the
      provinces of China were subdued and civilized by the emperors of
      the North; they were filled about the time of the Christian aera
      with cities and men, mulberry-trees and their precious
      inhabitants; and if the Chinese, with the knowledge of the
      compass, had possessed the genius of the Greeks or Phoenicians,
      they might have spread their discoveries over the southern
      hemisphere. I am not qualified to examine, and I am not disposed
      to believe, their distant voyages to the Persian Gulf, or the
      Cape of Good Hope; but their ancestors might equal the labors and
      success of the present race, and the sphere of their navigation
      might extend from the Isles of Japan to the Straits of Malacca,
      the pillars, if we may apply that name, of an Oriental Hercules.
      70 Without losing sight of land, they might sail along the coast
      to the extreme promontory of Achin, which is annually visited by
      ten or twelve ships laden with the productions, the manufactures,
      and even the artificers of China; the Island of Sumatra and the
      opposite peninsula are faintly delineated 71 as the regions of
      gold and silver; and the trading cities named in the geography of
      Ptolemy may indicate, that this wealth was not solely derived
      from the mines. The direct interval between Sumatra and Ceylon is
      about three hundred leagues: the Chinese and Indian navigators
      were conducted by the flight of birds and periodical winds; and
      the ocean might be securely traversed in square-built ships,
      which, instead of iron, were sewed together with the strong
      thread of the cocoanut. Ceylon, Serendib, or Taprobana, was
      divided between two hostile princes; one of whom possessed the
      mountains, the elephants, and the luminous carbuncle, and the
      other enjoyed the more solid riches of domestic industry, foreign
      trade, and the capacious harbor of Trinquemale, which received
      and dismissed the fleets of the East and West. In this hospitable
      isle, at an equal distance (as it was computed) from their
      respective countries, the silk merchants of China, who had
      collected in their voyages aloes, cloves, nutmeg, and sandal
      wood, maintained a free and beneficial commerce with the
      inhabitants of the Persian Gulf. The subjects of the great king
      exalted, without a rival, his power and magnificence: and the
      Roman, who confounded their vanity by comparing his paltry coin
      with a gold medal of the emperor Anastasius, had sailed to
      Ceylon, in an Aethiopian ship, as a simple passenger. 72

      As silk became of indispensable use, the emperor Justinian saw
      with concern that the Persians had occupied by land and sea the
      monopoly of this important supply, and that the wealth of his
      subjects was continually drained by a nation of enemies and
      idolaters. An active government would have restored the trade of
      Egypt and the navigation of the Red Sea, which had decayed with
      the prosperity of the empire; and the Roman vessels might have
      sailed, for the purchase of silk, to the ports of Ceylon, of
      Malacca, or even of China. Justinian embraced a more humble
      expedient, and solicited the aid of his Christian allies, the
      Aethiopians of Abyssinia, who had recently acquired the arts of
      navigation, the spirit of trade, and the seaport of Adulis, 73
      7311 still decorated with the trophies of a Grecian conqueror.
      Along the African coast, they penetrated to the equator in search
      of gold, emeralds, and aromatics; but they wisely declined an
      unequal competition, in which they must be always prevented by
      the vicinity of the Persians to the markets of India; and the
      emperor submitted to the disappointment, till his wishes were
      gratified by an unexpected event. The gospel had been preached to
      the Indians: a bishop already governed the Christians of St.
      Thomas on the pepper-coast of Malabar; a church was planted in
      Ceylon, and the missionaries pursued the footsteps of commerce to
      the extremities of Asia. 74 Two Persian monks had long resided in
      China, perhaps in the royal city of Nankin, the seat of a monarch
      addicted to foreign superstitions, and who actually received an
      embassy from the Isle of Ceylon. Amidst their pious occupations,
      they viewed with a curious eye the common dress of the Chinese,
      the manufactures of silk, and the myriads of silk-worms, whose
      education (either on trees or in houses) had once been considered
      as the labor of queens. 75 They soon discovered that it was
      impracticable to transport the short-lived insect, but that in
      the eggs a numerous progeny might be preserved and multiplied in
      a distant climate. Religion or interest had more power over the
      Persian monks than the love of their country: after a long
      journey, they arrived at Constantinople, imparted their project
      to the emperor, and were liberally encouraged by the gifts and
      promises of Justinian. To the historians of that prince, a
      campaign at the foot of Mount Caucasus has seemed more deserving
      of a minute relation than the labors of these missionaries of
      commerce, who again entered China, deceived a jealous people by
      concealing the eggs of the silk-worm in a hollow cane, and
      returned in triumph with the spoils of the East. Under their
      direction, the eggs were hatched at the proper season by the
      artificial heat of dung; the worms were fed with mulberry leaves;
      they lived and labored in a foreign climate; a sufficient number
      of butterflies was saved to propagate the race, and trees were
      planted to supply the nourishment of the rising generations.
      Experience and reflection corrected the errors of a new attempt,
      and the Sogdoite ambassadors acknowledged, in the succeeding
      reign, that the Romans were not inferior to the natives of China
      in the education of the insects, and the manufactures of silk, 76
      in which both China and Constantinople have been surpassed by the
      industry of modern Europe. I am not insensible of the benefits of
      elegant luxury; yet I reflect with some pain, that if the
      importers of silk had introduced the art of printing, already
      practised by the Chinese, the comedies of Menander and the entire
      decads of Livy would have been perpetuated in the editions of the
      sixth century.

      A larger view of the globe might at least have promoted the
      improvement of speculative science, but the Christian geography
      was forcibly extracted from texts of Scripture, and the study of
      nature was the surest symptom of an unbelieving mind. The
      orthodox faith confined the habitable world to one temperate
      zone, and represented the earth as an oblong surface, four
      hundred days’ journey in length, two hundred in breadth,
      encompassed by the ocean, and covered by the solid crystal of the

      IV. The subjects of Justinian were dissatisfied with the times,
      and with the government. Europe was overrun by the Barbarians,
      and Asia by the monks: the poverty of the West discouraged the
      trade and manufactures of the East: the produce of labor was
      consumed by the unprofitable servants of the church, the state,
      and the army; and a rapid decrease was felt in the fixed and
      circulating capitals which constitute the national wealth. The
      public distress had been alleviated by the economy of Anastasius,
      and that prudent emperor accumulated an immense treasure, while
      he delivered his people from the most odious or oppressive taxes.
      7711 Their gratitude universally applauded the abolition of the
      gold of affliction, a personal tribute on the industry of the
      poor, 78 but more intolerable, as it should seem, in the form
      than in the substance, since the flourishing city of Edessa paid
      only one hundred and forty pounds of gold, which was collected in
      four years from ten thousand artificers. 79 Yet such was the
      parsimony which supported this liberal disposition, that, in a
      reign of twenty-seven years, Anastasius saved, from his annual
      revenue, the enormous sum of thirteen millions sterling, or three
      hundred and twenty thousand pounds of gold. 80 His example was
      neglected, and his treasure was abused, by the nephew of Justin.
      The riches of Justinian were speedily exhausted by alms and
      buildings, by ambitious wars, and ignominious treaties. His
      revenues were found inadequate to his expenses. Every art was
      tried to extort from the people the gold and silver which he
      scattered with a lavish hand from Persia to France: 81 his reign
      was marked by the vicissitudes or rather by the combat, of
      rapaciousness and avarice, of splendor and poverty; he lived with
      the reputation of hidden treasures, 82 and bequeathed to his
      successor the payment of his debts. 83 Such a character has been
      justly accused by the voice of the people and of posterity: but
      public discontent is credulous; private malice is bold; and a
      lover of truth will peruse with a suspicious eye the instructive
      anecdotes of Procopius. The secret historian represents only the
      vices of Justinian, and those vices are darkened by his
      malevolent pencil. Ambiguous actions are imputed to the worst
      motives; error is confounded with guilt, accident with design,
      and laws with abuses; the partial injustice of a moment is
      dexterously applied as the general maxim of a reign of thirty-two
      years; the emperor alone is made responsible for the faults of
      his officers, the disorders of the times, and the corruption of
      his subjects; and even the calamities of nature, plagues,
      earthquakes, and inundations, are imputed to the prince of the
      daemons, who had mischievously assumed the form of Justinian. 84

      7711 (return) [ See the character of Anastasius in Joannes Lydus
      de Magistratibus, iii. c. 45, 46, p. 230—232. His economy is
      there said to have degenerated into parsimony. He is accused of
      having taken away the levying of taxes and payment of the troops
      from the municipal authorities, (the decurionate) in the Eastern
      cities, and intrusted it to an extortionate officer named Mannus.
      But he admits that the imperial revenue was enormously increased
      by this measure. A statue of iron had been erected to Anastasius
      in the Hippodrome, on which appeared one morning this pasquinade.
      This epigram is also found in the Anthology. Jacobs, vol. iv. p.
      114 with some better readings. This iron statue meetly do we

      avarice flow, This fell Charybdis, Scylla, near to thee, This
      fierce devouring Anastasius, see; And tremble, Scylla! on thee,
      too, his greed, Coining thy brazen deity, may feed. But Lydus,
      with no uncommon inconsistency in such writers, proceeds to paint
      the character of Anastasius as endowed with almost every virtue,
      not excepting the utmost liberality. He was only prevented by
      death from relieving his subjects altogether from the capitation
      tax, which he greatly diminished.—M.]

      Magistratibus (published by Hase at Paris, 1812, and reprinted in
      the new edition of the Byzantine Historians,) was written during
      the reign of Justinian. This work of Lydus throws no great light
      on the earlier history of the Roman magistracy, but gives some
      curious details of the changes and retrenchments in the offices
      of state, which took place at this time. The personal history of
      the author, with the account of his early and rapid advancement,
      and the emoluments of the posts which he successively held, with
      the bitter disappointment which he expresses, at finding himself,
      at the height of his ambition, in an unpaid place, is an
      excellent illustration of this statement. Gibbon has before, c.
      iv. n. 45, and c. xvii. n. 112, traced the progress of a Roman
      citizen to the highest honors of the state under the empire; the
      steps by which Lydus reached his humbler eminence may likewise
      throw light on the civil service at this period. He was first
      received into the office of the Praetorian praefect; became a
      notary in that office, and made in one year 1000 golden solidi,
      and that without extortion. His place and the influence of his
      relatives obtained him a wife with 400 pounds of gold for her
      dowry. He became chief chartularius, with an annual stipend of
      twenty-four solidi, and considerable emoluments for all the
      various services which he performed. He rose to an Augustalis,
      and finally to the dignity of Corniculus, the highest, and at one
      time the most lucrative office in the department. But the
      Praetorian praefect had gradually been deprived of his powers and
      his honors. He lost the superintendence of the supply and
      manufacture of arms; the uncontrolled charge of the public posts;
      the levying of the troops; the command of the army in war when
      the emperors ceased nominally to command in person, but really
      through the Praetorian praefect; that of the household troops,
      which fell to the magister aulae. At length the office was so
      completely stripped of its power, as to be virtually abolished,
      (see de Magist. l. iii. c. 40, p. 220, &c.) This diminution of
      the office of the praefect destroyed the emoluments of his
      subordinate officers, and Lydus not only drew no revenue from his
      dignity, but expended upon it all the gains of his former
      services. Lydus gravely refers this calamitous, and, as he
      considers it, fatal degradation of the Praetorian office to the
      alteration in the style of the official documents from Latin to
      Greek; and refers to a prophecy of a certain Fonteius, which
      connected the ruin of the Roman empire with its abandonment of
      its language. Lydus chiefly owed his promotion to his knowledge
      of Latin!—M.]

      After this precaution, I shall briefly relate the anecdotes of
      avarice and rapine under the following heads: I. Justinian was so
      profuse that he could not be liberal. The civil and military
      officers, when they were admitted into the service of the palace,
      obtained an humble rank and a moderate stipend; they ascended by
      seniority to a station of affluence and repose; the annual
      pensions, of which the most honorable class was abolished by
      Justinian, amounted to four hundred thousand pounds; and this
      domestic economy was deplored by the venal or indigent courtiers
      as the last outrage on the majesty of the empire. The posts, the
      salaries of physicians, and the nocturnal illuminations, were
      objects of more general concern; and the cities might justly
      complain, that he usurped the municipal revenues which had been
      appropriated to these useful institutions. Even the soldiers were
      injured; and such was the decay of military spirit, that they
      were injured with impunity. The emperor refused, at the return of
      each fifth year, the customary donative of five pieces of gold,
      reduced his veterans to beg their bread, and suffered unpaid
      armies to melt away in the wars of Italy and Persia. II. The
      humanity of his predecessors had always remitted, in some
      auspicious circumstance of their reign, the arrears of the public
      tribute, and they dexterously assumed the merit of resigning
      those claims which it was impracticable to enforce. “Justinian,
      in the space of thirty-two years, has never granted a similar
      indulgence; and many of his subjects have renounced the
      possession of those lands whose value is insufficient to satisfy
      the demands of the treasury. To the cities which had suffered by
      hostile inroads Anastasius promised a general exemption of seven
      years: the provinces of Justinian have been ravaged by the
      Persians and Arabs, the Huns and Sclavonians; but his vain and
      ridiculous dispensation of a single year has been confined to
      those places which were actually taken by the enemy.” Such is the
      language of the secret historian, who expressly denies that any
      indulgence was granted to Palestine after the revolt of the
      Samaritans; a false and odious charge, confuted by the authentic
      record which attests a relief of thirteen centenaries of gold
      (fifty-two thousand pounds) obtained for that desolate province
      by the intercession of St. Sabas. 85 III. Procopius has not
      condescended to explain the system of taxation, which fell like a
      hail-storm upon the land, like a devouring pestilence on its
      inhabitants: but we should become the accomplices of his
      malignity, if we imputed to Justinian alone the ancient though
      rigorous principle, that a whole district should be condemned to
      sustain the partial loss of the persons or property of
      individuals. The Annona, or supply of corn for the use of the
      army and capital, was a grievous and arbitrary exaction, which
      exceeded, perhaps in a tenfold proportion, the ability of the
      farmer; and his distress was aggravated by the partial injustice
      of weights and measures, and the expense and labor of distant
      carriage. In a time of scarcity, an extraordinary requisition was
      made to the adjacent provinces of Thrace, Bithynia, and Phrygia:
      but the proprietors, after a wearisome journey and perilous
      navigation, received so inadequate a compensation, that they
      would have chosen the alternative of delivering both the corn and
      price at the doors of their granaries. These precautions might
      indicate a tender solicitude for the welfare of the capital; yet
      Constantinople did not escape the rapacious despotism of
      Justinian. Till his reign, the Straits of the Bosphorus and
      Hellespont were open to the freedom of trade, and nothing was
      prohibited except the exportation of arms for the service of the
      Barbarians. At each of these gates of the city, a praetor was
      stationed, the minister of Imperial avarice; heavy customs were
      imposed on the vessels and their merchandise; the oppression was
      retaliated on the helpless consumer; the poor were afflicted by
      the artificial scarcity, and exorbitant price of the market; and
      a people, accustomed to depend on the liberality of their prince,
      might sometimes complain of the deficiency of water and bread. 86
      The aerial tribute, without a name, a law, or a definite object,
      was an annual gift of one hundred and twenty thousand pounds,
      which the emperor accepted from his Praetorian praefect; and the
      means of payment were abandoned to the discretion of that
      powerful magistrate.

      IV. Even such a tax was less intolerable than the privilege of
      monopolies, 8611 which checked the fair competition of industry,
      and, for the sake of a small and dishonest gain, imposed an
      arbitrary burden on the wants and luxury of the subject. “As
      soon” (I transcribe the Anecdotes) “as the exclusive sale of silk
      was usurped by the Imperial treasurer, a whole people, the
      manufacturers of Tyre and Berytus, was reduced to extreme misery,
      and either perished with hunger, or fled to the hostile dominions
      of Persia.” A province might suffer by the decay of its
      manufactures, but in this example of silk, Procopius has
      partially overlooked the inestimable and lasting benefit which
      the empire received from the curiosity of Justinian. His addition
      of one seventh to the ordinary price of copper money may be
      interpreted with the same candor; and the alteration, which might
      be wise, appears to have been innocent; since he neither alloyed
      the purity, nor enhanced the value, of the gold coin, 87 the
      legal measure of public and private payments. V. The ample
      jurisdiction required by the farmers of the revenue to accomplish
      their engagements might be placed in an odious light, as if they
      had purchased from the emperor the lives and fortunes of their
      fellow-citizens. And a more direct sale of honors and offices was
      transacted in the palace, with the permission, or at least with
      the connivance, of Justinian and Theodora. The claims of merit,
      even those of favor, were disregarded, and it was almost
      reasonable to expect, that the bold adventurer, who had
      undertaken the trade of a magistrate, should find a rich
      compensation for infamy, labor, danger, the debts which he had
      contracted, and the heavy interest which he paid. A sense of the
      disgrace and mischief of this venal practice, at length awakened
      the slumbering virtue of Justinian; and he attempted, by the
      sanction of oaths 88 and penalties, to guard the integrity of his
      government: but at the end of a year of perjury, his rigorous
      edict was suspended, and corruption licentiously abused her
      triumph over the impotence of the laws. VI. The testament of
      Eulalius, count of the domestics, declared the emperor his sole
      heir, on condition, however, that he should discharge his debts
      and legacies, allow to his three daughters a decent maintenance,
      and bestow each of them in marriage, with a portion of ten pounds
      of gold. But the splendid fortune of Eulalius had been consumed
      by fire, and the inventory of his goods did not exceed the
      trifling sum of five hundred and sixty-four pieces of gold. A
      similar instance, in Grecian history, admonished the emperor of
      the honorable part prescribed for his imitation. He checked the
      selfish murmurs of the treasury, applauded the confidence of his
      friend, discharged the legacies and debts, educated the three
      virgins under the eye of the empress Theodora, and doubled the
      marriage portion which had satisfied the tenderness of their
      father. 89 The humanity of a prince (for princes cannot be
      generous) is entitled to some praise; yet even in this act of
      virtue we may discover the inveterate custom of supplanting the
      legal or natural heirs, which Procopius imputes to the reign of
      Justinian. His charge is supported by eminent names and
      scandalous examples; neither widows nor orphans were spared; and
      the art of soliciting, or extorting, or supposing testaments, was
      beneficially practised by the agents of the palace. This base and
      mischievous tyranny invades the security of private life; and the
      monarch who has indulged an appetite for gain, will soon be
      tempted to anticipate the moment of succession, to interpret
      wealth as an evidence of guilt, and to proceed, from the claim of
      inheritance, to the power of confiscation. VII. Among the forms
      of rapine, a philosopher may be permitted to name the conversion
      of Pagan or heretical riches to the use of the faithful; but in
      the time of Justinian this holy plunder was condemned by the
      sectaries alone, who became the victims of his orthodox avarice.

      Chapter XL: Reign Of Justinian.—Part IV.

      Dishonor might be ultimately reflected on the character of
      Justinian; but much of the guilt, and still more of the profit,
      was intercepted by the ministers, who were seldom promoted for
      their virtues, and not always selected for their talents. 91 The
      merits of Tribonian the quaestor will hereafter be weighed in the
      reformation of the Roman law; but the economy of the East was
      subordinate to the Praetorian praefect, and Procopius has
      justified his anecdotes by the portrait which he exposes in his
      public history, of the notorious vices of John of Cappadocia. 92

      921 His knowledge was not borrowed from the schools, 93 and his
      style was scarcely legible; but he excelled in the powers of
      native genius, to suggest the wisest counsels, and to find
      expedients in the most desperate situations. The corruption of
      his heart was equal to the vigor of his understanding. Although
      he was suspected of magic and Pagan superstition, he appeared
      insensible to the fear of God or the reproaches of man; and his
      aspiring fortune was raised on the death of thousands, the
      poverty of millions, the ruins of cities, and the desolation of
      provinces. From the dawn of light to the moment of dinner, he
      assiduously labored to enrich his master and himself at the
      expense of the Roman world; the remainder of the day was spent in
      sensual and obscene pleasures, 931 and the silent hours of the
      night were interrupted by the perpetual dread of the justice of
      an assassin. His abilities, perhaps his vices, recommended him to
      the lasting friendship of Justinian: the emperor yielded with
      reluctance to the fury of the people; his victory was displayed
      by the immediate restoration of their enemy; and they felt above
      ten years, under his oppressive administration, that he was
      stimulated by revenge, rather than instructed by misfortune.
      Their murmurs served only to fortify the resolution of Justinian;
      but the resentment of Theodora, disdained a power before which
      every knee was bent, and attempted to sow the seeds of discord
      between the emperor and his beloved consort. Even Theodora
      herself was constrained to dissemble, to wait a favorable moment,
      and, by an artful conspiracy, to render John of Coppadocia the
      accomplice of his own destruction. 932 At a time when Belisarius,
      unless he had been a hero, must have shown himself a rebel, his
      wife Antonina, who enjoyed the secret confidence of the empress,
      communicated his feigned discontent to Euphemia, the daughter of
      the praefect; the credulous virgin imparted to her father the
      dangerous project, and John, who might have known the value of
      oaths and promises, was tempted to accept a nocturnal, and almost
      treasonable, interview with the wife of Belisarius. An ambuscade
      of guards and eunuchs had been posted by the command of Theodora;
      they rushed with drawn swords to seize or to punish the guilty
      minister: he was saved by the fidelity of his attendants; but
      instead of appealing to a gracious sovereign, who had privately
      warned him of his danger, he pusillanimously fled to the
      sanctuary of the church. The favorite of Justinian was sacrificed
      to conjugal tenderness or domestic tranquility; the conversion of
      a praefect into a priest extinguished his ambitious hopes: but
      the friendship of the emperor alleviated his disgrace, and he
      retained in the mild exile of Cyzicus an ample portion of his
      riches. Such imperfect revenge could not satisfy the unrelenting
      hatred of Theodora; the murder of his old enemy, the bishop of
      Cyzicus, afforded a decent pretence; and John of Cappadocia,
      whose actions had deserved a thousand deaths, was at last
      condemned for a crime of which he was innocent. A great minister,
      who had been invested with the honors of consul and patrician,
      was ignominiously scourged like the vilest of malefactors; a
      tattered cloak was the sole remnant of his fortunes; he was
      transported in a bark to the place of his banishment at
      Antinopolis in Upper Egypt, and the praefect of the East begged
      his bread through the cities which had trembled at his name.
      During an exile of seven years, his life was protracted and
      threatened by the ingenious cruelty of Theodora; and when her
      death permitted the emperor to recall a servant whom he had
      abandoned with regret, the ambition of John of Cappadocia was
      reduced to the humble duties of the sacerdotal profession. His
      successors convinced the subjects of Justinian, that the arts of
      oppression might still be improved by experience and industry;
      the frauds of a Syrian banker were introduced into the
      administration of the finances; and the example of the praefect
      was diligently copied by the quaestor, the public and private
      treasurer, the governors of provinces, and the principal
      magistrates of the Eastern empire. 94

      91 (return) [ One of these, Anatolius, perished in an
      earthquake—doubtless a judgment! The complaints and clamors of
      the people in Agathias (l. v. p. 146, 147) are almost an echo of
      the anecdote. The aliena pecunia reddenda of Corippus (l. ii.
      381, &c.,) is not very honorable to Justinian’s memory.]

      92 (return) [ See the history and character of John of Cappadocia

      and anecdotes is a mortal wound to the reputation of the
      praefct.]

      921 (return) [ This view, particularly of the cruelty of John of
      Cappadocia, is confirmed by the testimony of Joannes Lydus, who
      was in the office of the praefect, and eye-witness of the
      tortures inflicted by his command on the miserable debtors, or
      supposed debtors, of the state. He mentions one horrible instance
      of a respectable old man, with whom he was personally acquainted,
      who, being suspected of possessing money, was hung up by the
      hands till he was dead. Lydus de Magist. lib. iii. c. 57, p.
      254.—M.]

      93 (return) [ A forcible expression.]

      931 (return) [ Joannes Lydus is diffuse on this subject, lib.
      iii. c. 65, p. 268. But the indignant virtue of Lydus seems
      greatly stimulated by the loss of his official fees, which he
      ascribes to the innovations of the minister.—M.]

      932 (return) [ According to Lydus, Theodora disclosed the crimes
      and unpopularity of the minister to Justinian, but the emperor
      had not the courage to remove, and was unable to replace, a
      servant, under whom his finances seemed to prosper. He attributes
      the sedition and conflagration to the popular resentment against
      the tyranny of John, lib. iii. c 70, p. 278. Unfortunately there
      is a large gap in his work just at this period.—M.]

      94 (return) [ The chronology of Procopius is loose and obscure;
      but with the aid of Pagi I can discern that John was appointed
      Praetorian praefect of the East in the year 530—that he was
      removed in January, 532—restored before June, 533—banished in
      541—and recalled between June, 548, and April 1, 549. Aleman. (p.
      96, 97) gives the list of his ten successors—a rapid series in a
      part of a single reign. * Note: Lydus gives a high character of
      Phocas, his successor tom. iii. c. 78 p. 288.—M.]

      V. The edifices of Justinian were cemented with the blood and
      treasure of his people; but those stately structures appeared to
      announce the prosperity of the empire, and actually displayed the
      skill of their architects. Both the theory and practice of the
      arts which depend on mathematical science and mechanical power,
      were cultivated under the patronage of the emperors; the fame of
      Archimedes was rivalled by Proclus and Anthemius; and if their
      miracles had been related by intelligent spectators, they might
      now enlarge the speculations, instead of exciting the distrust,
      of philosophers. A tradition has prevailed, that the Roman fleet
      was reduced to ashes in the port of Syracuse, by the
      burning-glasses of Archimedes; 95 and it is asserted, that a
      similar expedient was employed by Proclus to destroy the Gothic
      vessels in the harbor of Constantinople, and to protect his
      benefactor Anastasius against the bold enterprise of Vitalian. 96
      A machine was fixed on the walls of the city, consisting of a
      hexagon mirror of polished brass, with many smaller and movable
      polygons to receive and reflect the rays of the meridian sun; and
      a consuming flame was darted, to the distance, perhaps of two
      hundred feet. 97 The truth of these two extraordinary facts is
      invalidated by the silence of the most authentic historians; and
      the use of burning-glasses was never adopted in the attack or
      defence of places. 98 Yet the admirable experiments of a French
      philosopher 99 have demonstrated the possibility of such a
      mirror; and, since it is possible, I am more disposed to
      attribute the art to the greatest mathematicians of antiquity,
      than to give the merit of the fiction to the idle fancy of a monk
      or a sophist. According to another story, Proclus applied sulphur
      to the destruction of the Gothic fleet; 100 in a modern
      imagination, the name of sulphur is instantly connected with the
      suspicion of gunpowder, and that suspicion is propagated by the
      secret arts of his disciple Anthemius. 101 A citizen of Tralles
      in Asia had five sons, who were all distinguished in their
      respective professions by merit and success. Olympius excelled in
      the knowledge and practice of the Roman jurisprudence. Dioscorus
      and Alexander became learned physicians; but the skill of the
      former was exercised for the benefit of his fellow-citizens,
      while his more ambitious brother acquired wealth and reputation
      at Rome. The fame of Metrodorus the grammarian, and of Anthemius
      the mathematician and architect, reached the ears of the emperor
      Justinian, who invited them to Constantinople; and while the one
      instructed the rising generation in the schools of eloquence, the
      other filled the capital and provinces with more lasting
      monuments of his art. In a trifling dispute relative to the walls
      or windows of their contiguous houses, he had been vanquished by
      the eloquence of his neighbor Zeno; but the orator was defeated
      in his turn by the master of mechanics, whose malicious, though
      harmless, stratagems are darkly represented by the ignorance of
      Agathias. In a lower room, Anthemius arranged several vessels or
      caldrons of water, each of them covered by the wide bottom of a
      leathern tube, which rose to a narrow top, and was artificially
      conveyed among the joists and rafters of the adjacent building. A
      fire was kindled beneath the caldron; the steam of the boiling
      water ascended through the tubes; the house was shaken by the
      efforts of imprisoned air, and its trembling inhabitants might
      wonder that the city was unconscious of the earthquake which they
      had felt. At another time, the friends of Zeno, as they sat at
      table, were dazzled by the intolerable light which flashed in
      their eyes from the reflecting mirrors of Anthemius; they were
      astonished by the noise which he produced from the collision of
      certain minute and sonorous particles; and the orator declared in
      tragic style to the senate, that a mere mortal must yield to the
      power of an antagonist, who shook the earth with the trident of
      Neptune, and imitated the thunder and lightning of Jove himself.
      The genius of Anthemius, and his colleague Isidore the Milesian,
      was excited and employed by a prince, whose taste for
      architecture had degenerated into a mischievous and costly
      passion. His favorite architects submitted their designs and
      difficulties to Justinian, and discreetly confessed how much
      their laborious meditations were surpassed by the intuitive
      knowledge of celestial inspiration of an emperor, whose views
      were always directed to the benefit of his people, the glory of
      his reign, and the salvation of his soul. 102

      102 (return) [ See Procopius, (de Edificiis, l. i. c. 1, 2, l.
      ii. c. 3.) He relates a coincidence of dreams, which supposes
      some fraud in Justinian or his architect. They both saw, in a
      vision, the same plan for stopping an inundation at Dara. A stone
      quarry near Jerusalem was revealed to the emperor, (l. v. c. 6:)
      an angel was tricked into the perpetual custody of St. Sophia,
      (Anonym. de Antiq. C. P. l. iv. p. 70.)]

      The principal church, which was dedicated by the founder of
      Constantinople to St. Sophia, or the eternal wisdom, had been
      twice destroyed by fire; after the exile of John Chrysostom, and
      during the Nika of the blue and green factions. No sooner did the
      tumult subside, than the Christian populace deplored their
      sacrilegious rashness; but they might have rejoiced in the
      calamity, had they foreseen the glory of the new temple, which at
      the end of forty days was strenuously undertaken by the piety of
      Justinian. 103 The ruins were cleared away, a more spacious plan
      was described, and as it required the consent of some proprietors
      of ground, they obtained the most exorbitant terms from the eager
      desires and timorous conscience of the monarch. Anthemius formed
      the design, and his genius directed the hands of ten thousand
      workmen, whose payment in pieces of fine silver was never delayed
      beyond the evening. The emperor himself, clad in a linen tunic,
      surveyed each day their rapid progress, and encouraged their
      diligence by his familiarity, his zeal, and his rewards. The new
      Cathedral of St. Sophia was consecrated by the patriarch, five
      years, eleven months, and ten days from the first foundation; and
      in the midst of the solemn festival Justinian exclaimed with
      devout vanity, “Glory be to God, who hath thought me worthy to
      accomplish so great a work; I have vanquished thee, O Solomon!”
      104 But the pride of the Roman Solomon, before twenty years had
      elapsed, was humbled by an earthquake, which overthrew the
      eastern part of the dome. Its splendor was again restored by the
      perseverance of the same prince; and in the thirty-sixth year of
      his reign, Justinian celebrated the second dedication of a temple
      which remains, after twelve centuries, a stately monument of his
      fame. The architecture of St. Sophia, which is now converted into
      the principal mosch, has been imitated by the Turkish sultans,
      and that venerable pile continues to excite the fond admiration
      of the Greeks, and the more rational curiosity of European
      travellers. The eye of the spectator is disappointed by an
      irregular prospect of half-domes and shelving roofs: the western
      front, the principal approach, is destitute of simplicity and
      magnificence; and the scale of dimensions has been much surpassed
      by several of the Latin cathedrals. But the architect who first
      erected and aerial cupola, is entitled to the praise of bold
      design and skilful execution. The dome of St. Sophia, illuminated
      by four-and-twenty windows, is formed with so small a curve, that
      the depth is equal only to one sixth of its diameter; the measure
      of that diameter is one hundred and fifteen feet, and the lofty
      centre, where a crescent has supplanted the cross, rises to the
      perpendicular height of one hundred and eighty feet above the
      pavement. The circle which encompasses the dome, lightly reposes
      on four strong arches, and their weight is firmly supported by
      four massy piles, whose strength is assisted, on the northern and
      southern sides, by four columns of Egyptian granite.

      A Greek cross, inscribed in a quadrangle, represents the form of
      the edifice; the exact breadth is two hundred and forty-three
      feet, and two hundred and sixty-nine may be assigned for the
      extreme length from the sanctuary in the east, to the nine
      western doors, which open into the vestibule, and from thence
      into the narthex or exterior portico. That portico was the humble
      station of the penitents. The nave or body of the church was
      filled by the congregation of the faithful; but the two sexes
      were prudently distinguished, and the upper and lower galleries
      were allotted for the more private devotion of the women. Beyond
      the northern and southern piles, a balustrade, terminated on
      either side by the thrones of the emperor and the patriarch,
      divided the nave from the choir; and the space, as far as the
      steps of the altar, was occupied by the clergy and singers. The
      altar itself, a name which insensibly became familiar to
      Christian ears, was placed in the eastern recess, artificially
      built in the form of a demi-cylinder; and this sanctuary
      communicated by several doors with the sacristy, the vestry, the
      baptistery, and the contiguous buildings, subservient either to
      the pomp of worship, or the private use of the ecclesiastical
      ministers. The memory of past calamities inspired Justinian with
      a wise resolution, that no wood, except for the doors, should be
      admitted into the new edifice; and the choice of the materials
      was applied to the strength, the lightness, or the splendor of
      the respective parts. The solid piles which contained the cupola
      were composed of huge blocks of freestone, hewn into squares and
      triangles, fortified by circles of iron, and firmly cemented by
      the infusion of lead and quicklime: but the weight of the cupola
      was diminished by the levity of its substance, which consists
      either of pumice-stone that floats in the water, or of bricks
      from the Isle of Rhodes, five times less ponderous than the
      ordinary sort. The whole frame of the edifice was constructed of
      brick; but those base materials were concealed by a crust of
      marble; and the inside of St. Sophia, the cupola, the two larger,
      and the six smaller, semi-domes, the walls, the hundred columns,
      and the pavement, delight even the eyes of Barbarians, with a
      rich and variegated picture. A poet, 105 who beheld the primitive
      lustre of St. Sophia, enumerates the colors, the shades, and the
      spots of ten or twelve marbles, jaspers, and porphyries, which
      nature had profusely diversified, and which were blended and
      contrasted as it were by a skilful painter. The triumph of Christ
      was adorned with the last spoils of Paganism, but the greater
      part of these costly stones was extracted from the quarries of
      Asia Minor, the isles and continent of Greece, Egypt, Africa, and
      Gaul. Eight columns of porphyry, which Aurelian had placed in the
      temple of the sun, were offered by the piety of a Roman matron;
      eight others of green marble were presented by the ambitious zeal
      of the magistrates of Ephesus: both are admirable by their size
      and beauty, but every order of architecture disclaims their
      fantastic capital. A variety of ornaments and figures was
      curiously expressed in mosaic; and the images of Christ, of the
      Virgin, of saints, and of angels, which have been defaced by
      Turkish fanaticism, were dangerously exposed to the superstition
      of the Greeks. According to the sanctity of each object, the
      precious metals were distributed in thin leaves or in solid
      masses. The balustrade of the choir, the capitals of the pillars,
      the ornaments of the doors and galleries, were of gilt bronze;
      the spectator was dazzled by the glittering aspect of the cupola;
      the sanctuary contained forty thousand pounds weight of silver;
      and the holy vases and vestments of the altar were of the purest
      gold, enriched with inestimable gems. Before the structure of the
      church had arisen two cubits above the ground, forty-five
      thousand two hundred pounds were already consumed; and the whole
      expense amounted to three hundred and twenty thousand: each
      reader, according to the measure of his belief, may estimate
      their value either in gold or silver; but the sum of one million
      sterling is the result of the lowest computation. A magnificent
      temple is a laudable monument of national taste and religion; and
      the enthusiast who entered the dome of St. Sophia might be
      tempted to suppose that it was the residence, or even the
      workmanship, of the Deity. Yet how dull is the artifice, how
      insignificant is the labor, if it be compared with the formation
      of the vilest insect that crawls upon the surface of the temple!

      given plans, prospects, and inside views of St. Sophia; and his
      plans, though on a smaller scale, appear more correct than those
      of Ducange. I have adopted and reduced the measures of Grelot:
      but as no Christian can now ascend the dome, the height is
      borrowed from Evagrius, compared with Gyllius, Greaves, and the
      Oriental Geographer.]

      Proconnesian which formed the pavement; the Thessalian,
      Molossian, &c., which are less distinctly painted.]

      So minute a description of an edifice which time has respected,
      may attest the truth, and excuse the relation, of the innumerable
      works, both in the capital and provinces, which Justinian
      constructed on a smaller scale and less durable foundations. 106
      In Constantinople alone and the adjacent suburbs, he dedicated
      twenty-five churches to the honor of Christ, the Virgin, and the
      saints: most of these churches were decorated with marble and
      gold; and their various situation was skilfully chosen in a
      populous square, or a pleasant grove; on the margin of the
      sea-shore, or on some lofty eminence which overlooked the
      continents of Europe and Asia. The church of the Holy Apostles at
      Constantinople, and that of St. John at Ephesus, appear to have
      been framed on the same model: their domes aspired to imitate the
      cupolas of St. Sophia; but the altar was more judiciously placed
      under the centre of the dome, at the junction of four stately
      porticos, which more accurately expressed the figure of the Greek
      cross. The Virgin of Jerusalem might exult in the temple erected
      by her Imperial votary on a most ungrateful spot, which afforded
      neither ground nor materials to the architect. A level was formed
      by raising part of a deep valley to the height of the mountain.
      The stones of a neighboring quarry were hewn into regular forms;
      each block was fixed on a peculiar carriage, drawn by forty of
      the strongest oxen, and the roads were widened for the passage of
      such enormous weights. Lebanon furnished her loftiest cedars for
      the timbers of the church; and the seasonable discovery of a vein
      of red marble supplied its beautiful columns, two of which, the
      supporters of the exterior portico, were esteemed the largest in
      the world. The pious munificence of the emperor was diffused over
      the Holy Land; and if reason should condemn the monasteries of
      both sexes which were built or restored by Justinian, yet charity
      must applaud the wells which he sunk, and the hospitals which he
      founded, for the relief of the weary pilgrims. The schismatical
      temper of Egypt was ill entitled to the royal bounty; but in
      Syria and Africa, some remedies were applied to the disasters of
      wars and earthquakes, and both Carthage and Antioch, emerging
      from their ruins, might revere the name of their gracious
      benefactor. 107 Almost every saint in the calendar acquired the
      honors of a temple; almost every city of the empire obtained the
      solid advantages of bridges, hospitals, and aqueducts; but the
      severe liberality of the monarch disdained to indulge his
      subjects in the popular luxury of baths and theatres. While
      Justinian labored for the public service, he was not unmindful of
      his own dignity and ease. The Byzantine palace, which had been
      damaged by the conflagration, was restored with new magnificence;
      and some notion may be conceived of the whole edifice, by the
      vestibule or hall, which, from the doors perhaps, or the roof,
      was surnamed chalce, or the brazen. The dome of a spacious
      quadrangle was supported by massy pillars; the pavement and walls
      were incrusted with many-colored marbles—the emerald green of
      Laconia, the fiery red, and the white Phrygian stone, intersected
      with veins of a sea-green hue: the mosaic paintings of the dome
      and sides represented the glories of the African and Italian
      triumphs. On the Asiatic shore of the Propontis, at a small
      distance to the east of Chalcedon, the costly palace and gardens
      of Heraeum 108 were prepared for the summer residence of
      Justinian, and more especially of Theodora. The poets of the age
      have celebrated the rare alliance of nature and art, the harmony
      of the nymphs of the groves, the fountains, and the waves: yet
      the crowd of attendants who followed the court complained of
      their inconvenient lodgings, 109 and the nymphs were too often
      alarmed by the famous Porphyrio, a whale of ten cubits in
      breadth, and thirty in length, who was stranded at the mouth of
      the River Sangaris, after he had infested more than half a
      century the seas of Constantinople. 110

      The fortifications of Europe and Asia were multiplied by
      Justinian; but the repetition of those timid and fruitless
      precautions exposes, to a philosophic eye, the debility of the
      empire. 111 From Belgrade to the Euxine, from the conflux of the
      Save to the mouth of the Danube, a chain of above fourscore
      fortified places was extended along the banks of the great river.
      Single watch-towers were changed into spacious citadels; vacant
      walls, which the engineers contracted or enlarged according to
      the nature of the ground, were filled with colonies or garrisons;
      a strong fortress defended the ruins of Trajan’s bridge, 112 and
      several military stations affected to spread beyond the Danube
      the pride of the Roman name. But that name was divested of its
      terrors; the Barbarians, in their annual inroads, passed, and
      contemptuously repassed, before these useless bulwarks; and the
      inhabitants of the frontier, instead of reposing under the shadow
      of the general defence, were compelled to guard, with incessant
      vigilance, their separate habitations. The solitude of ancient
      cities, was replenished; the new foundations of Justinian
      acquired, perhaps too hastily, the epithets of impregnable and
      populous; and the auspicious place of his own nativity attracted
      the grateful reverence of the vainest of princes. Under the name
      of Justiniana prima, the obscure village of Tauresium became the
      seat of an archbishop and a praefect, whose jurisdiction extended
      over seven warlike provinces of Illyricum; 113 and the corrupt
      appellation of Giustendil still indicates, about twenty miles to
      the south of Sophia, the residence of a Turkish sanjak. 114 For
      the use of the emperor’s countryman, a cathedral, a place, and an
      aqueduct, were speedily constructed; the public and private
      edifices were adapted to the greatness of a royal city; and the
      strength of the walls resisted, during the lifetime of Justinian,
      the unskilful assaults of the Huns and Sclavonians. Their
      progress was sometimes retarded, and their hopes of rapine were
      disappointed, by the innumerable castles which, in the provinces
      of Dacia, Epirus, Thessaly, Macedonia, and Thrace, appeared to
      cover the whole face of the country. Six hundred of these forts
      were built or repaired by the emperor; but it seems reasonable to
      believe, that the far greater part consisted only of a stone or
      brick tower, in the midst of a square or circular area, which was
      surrounded by a wall and ditch, and afforded in a moment of
      danger some protection to the peasants and cattle of the
      neighboring villages. 115 Yet these military works, which
      exhausted the public treasure, could not remove the just
      apprehensions of Justinian and his European subjects. The warm
      baths of Anchialus in Thrace were rendered as safe as they were
      salutary; but the rich pastures of Thessalonica were foraged by
      the Scythian cavalry; the delicious vale of Tempe, three hundred
      miles from the Danube, was continually alarmed by the sound of
      war; 116 and no unfortified spot, however distant or solitary,
      could securely enjoy the blessings of peace. The Straits of
      Thermopylae, which seemed to protect, but which had so often
      betrayed, the safety of Greece, were diligently strengthened by
      the labors of Justinian. From the edge of the sea-shore, through
      the forests and valleys, and as far as the summit of the
      Thessalian mountains, a strong wall was continued, which occupied
      every practicable entrance. Instead of a hasty crowd of peasants,
      a garrison of two thousand soldiers was stationed along the
      rampart; granaries of corn and reservoirs of water were provided
      for their use; and by a precaution that inspired the cowardice
      which it foresaw, convenient fortresses were erected for their
      retreat. The walls of Corinth, overthrown by an earthquake, and
      the mouldering bulwarks of Athens and Plataea, were carefully
      restored; the Barbarians were discouraged by the prospect of
      successive and painful sieges: and the naked cities of
      Peloponnesus were covered by the fortifications of the Isthmus of
      Corinth. At the extremity of Europe, another peninsula, the
      Thracian Chersonesus, runs three days’ journey into the sea, to
      form, with the adjacent shores of Asia, the Straits of the
      Hellespont. The intervals between eleven populous towns were
      filled by lofty woods, fair pastures, and arable lands; and the
      isthmus, of thirty seven stadia or furlongs, had been fortified
      by a Spartan general nine hundred years before the reign of
      Justinian. 117 In an age of freedom and valor, the slightest
      rampart may prevent a surprise; and Procopius appears insensible
      of the superiority of ancient times, while he praises the solid
      construction and double parapet of a wall, whose long arms
      stretched on either side into the sea; but whose strength was
      deemed insufficient to guard the Chersonesus, if each city, and
      particularly Gallipoli and Sestus, had not been secured by their
      peculiar fortifications. The long wall, as it was emphatically
      styled, was a work as disgraceful in the object, as it was
      respectable in the execution. The riches of a capital diffuse
      themselves over the neighboring country, and the territory of
      Constantinople a paradise of nature, was adorned with the
      luxurious gardens and villas of the senators and opulent
      citizens. But their wealth served only to attract the bold and
      rapacious Barbarians; the noblest of the Romans, in the bosom of
      peaceful indolence, were led away into Scythian captivity, and
      their sovereign might view from his palace the hostile flames
      which were insolently spread to the gates of the Imperial city.
      At the distance only of forty miles, Anastasius was constrained
      to establish a last frontier; his long wall, of sixty miles from
      the Propontis to the Euxine, proclaimed the impotence of his
      arms; and as the danger became more imminent, new fortifications
      were added by the indefatigable prudence of Justinian. 118

      Asia Minor, after the submission of the Isaurians, 119 remained
      without enemies and without fortifications. Those bold savages,
      who had disdained to be the subjects of Gallienus, persisted two
      hundred and thirty years in a life of independence and rapine.
      The most successful princes respected the strength of the
      mountains and the despair of the natives; their fierce spirit was
      sometimes soothed with gifts, and sometimes restrained by terror;
      and a military count, with three legions, fixed his permanent and
      ignominious station in the heart of the Roman provinces. 120 But
      no sooner was the vigilance of power relaxed or diverted, than
      the light-armed squadrons descended from the hills, and invaded
      the peaceful plenty of Asia. Although the Isaurians were not
      remarkable for stature or bravery, want rendered them bold, and
      experience made them skilful in the exercise of predatory war.
      They advanced with secrecy and speed to the attack of villages
      and defenceless towns; their flying parties have sometimes
      touched the Hellespont, the Euxine, and the gates of Tarsus,
      Antioch, or Damascus; 121 and the spoil was lodged in their
      inaccessible mountains, before the Roman troops had received
      their orders, or the distant province had computed its loss. The
      guilt of rebellion and robbery excluded them from the rights of
      national enemies; and the magistrates were instructed, by an
      edict, that the trial or punishment of an Isaurian, even on the
      festival of Easter, was a meritorious act of justice and piety.
      122 If the captives were condemned to domestic slavery, they
      maintained, with their sword or dagger, the private quarrel of
      their masters; and it was found expedient for the public
      tranquillity to prohibit the service of such dangerous retainers.
      When their countryman Tarcalissaeus or Zeno ascended the throne,
      he invited a faithful and formidable band of Isaurians, who
      insulted the court and city, and were rewarded by an annual
      tribute of five thousand pounds of gold. But the hopes of fortune
      depopulated the mountains, luxury enervated the hardiness of
      their minds and bodies, and in proportion as they mixed with
      mankind, they became less qualified for the enjoyment of poor and
      solitary freedom. After the death of Zeno, his successor
      Anastasius suppressed their pensions, exposed their persons to
      the revenge of the people, banished them from Constantinople, and
      prepared to sustain a war, which left only the alternative of
      victory or servitude. A brother of the last emperor usurped the
      title of Augustus; his cause was powerfully supported by the
      arms, the treasures, and the magazines, collected by Zeno; and
      the native Isaurians must have formed the smallest portion of the
      hundred and fifty thousand Barbarians under his standard, which
      was sanctified, for the first time, by the presence of a fighting
      bishop. Their disorderly numbers were vanquished in the plains of
      Phrygia by the valor and discipline of the Goths; but a war of
      six years almost exhausted the courage of the emperor. 123 The
      Isaurians retired to their mountains; their fortresses were
      successively besieged and ruined; their communication with the
      sea was intercepted; the bravest of their leaders died in arms;
      the surviving chiefs, before their execution, were dragged in
      chains through the hippodrome; a colony of their youth was
      transplanted into Thrace, and the remnant of the people submitted
      to the Roman government. Yet some generations elapsed before
      their minds were reduced to the level of slavery. The populous
      villages of Mount Taurus were filled with horsemen and archers:
      they resisted the imposition of tributes, but they recruited the
      armies of Justinian; and his civil magistrates, the proconsul of
      Cappadocia, the count of Isauria, and the praetors of Lycaonia
      and Pisidia, were invested with military power to restrain the
      licentious practice of rapes and assassinations. 124

      Chapter XL: Reign Of Justinian.—Part V.

      If we extend our view from the tropic to the mouth of the Tanais,
      we may observe, on one hand, the precautions of Justinian to curb
      the savages of Aethiopia, 125 and on the other, the long walls
      which he constructed in Crimaea for the protection of his
      friendly Goths, a colony of three thousand shepherds and
      warriors. 126 From that peninsula to Trebizond, the eastern curve
      of the Euxine was secured by forts, by alliance, or by religion;
      and the possession of Lazica, the Colchos of ancient, the
      Mingrelia of modern, geography, soon became the object of an
      important war. Trebizond, in after-times the seat of a romantic
      empire, was indebted to the liberality of Justinian for a church,
      an aqueduct, and a castle, whose ditches are hewn in the solid
      rock. From that maritime city, frontier line of five hundred
      miles may be drawn to the fortress of Circesium, the last Roman
      station on the Euphrates. 127 Above Trebizond immediately, and
      five days’ journey to the south, the country rises into dark
      forests and craggy mountains, as savage though not so lofty as
      the Alps and the Pyrenees. In this rigorous climate, 128 where
      the snows seldom melt, the fruits are tardy and tasteless, even
      honey is poisonous: the most industrious tillage would be
      confined to some pleasant valleys; and the pastoral tribes
      obtained a scanty sustenance from the flesh and milk of their
      cattle. The Chalybians 129 derived their name and temper from the
      iron quality of the soil; and, since the days of Cyrus, they
      might produce, under the various appellations of Cha daeans and
      Zanians, an uninterrupted prescription of war and rapine. Under
      the reign of Justinian, they acknowledged the god and the emperor
      of the Romans, and seven fortresses were built in the most
      accessible passages, to exclude the ambition of the Persian
      monarch. 130 The principal source of the Euphrates descends from
      the Chalybian mountains, and seems to flow towards the west and
      the Euxine: bending to the south-west, the river passes under the
      walls of Satala and Melitene, (which were restored by Justinian
      as the bulwarks of the Lesser Armenia,) and gradually approaches
      the Mediterranean Sea; till at length, repelled by Mount Taurus,
      131 the Euphrates inclines its long and flexible course to the
      south-east and the Gulf of Persia. Among the Roman cities beyond
      the Euphrates, we distinguish two recent foundations, which were
      named from Theodosius, and the relics of the martyrs; and two
      capitals, Amida and Edessa, which are celebrated in the history
      of every age. Their strength was proportioned by Justinian to the
      danger of their situation. A ditch and palisade might be
      sufficient to resist the artless force of the cavalry of Scythia;
      but more elaborate works were required to sustain a regular siege
      against the arms and treasures of the great king. His skilful
      engineers understood the methods of conducting deep mines, and of
      raising platforms to the level of the rampart: he shook the
      strongest battlements with his military engines, and sometimes
      advanced to the assault with a line of movable turrets on the
      backs of elephants. In the great cities of the East, the
      disadvantage of space, perhaps of position, was compensated by
      the zeal of the people, who seconded the garrison in the defence
      of their country and religion; and the fabulous promise of the
      Son of God, that Edessa should never be taken, filled the
      citizens with valiant confidence, and chilled the besiegers with
      doubt and dismay. 132 The subordinate towns of Armenia and
      Mesopotamia were diligently strengthened, and the posts which
      appeared to have any command of ground or water were occupied by
      numerous forts, substantially built of stone, or more hastily
      erected with the obvious materials of earth and brick. The eye of
      Justinian investigated every spot; and his cruel precautions
      might attract the war into some lonely vale, whose peaceful
      natives, connected by trade and marriage, were ignorant of
      national discord and the quarrels of princes. Westward of the
      Euphrates, a sandy desert extends above six hundred miles to the
      Red Sea. Nature had interposed a vacant solitude between the
      ambition of two rival empires; the Arabians, till Mahomet arose,
      were formidable only as robbers; and in the proud security of
      peace the fortifications of Syria were neglected on the most
      vulnerable side.

      132 (return) [ Procopius (Persic. l. ii. c. 12) tells the story

      The promise was not in the primitive lie of Eusebius, but dates
      at least from the year 400; and a third lie, the Veronica, was
      soon raised on the two former, (Evagrius, l. iv. c. 27.) As
      Edessa has been taken, Tillemont must disclaim the promise, (Mem.
      Eccles. tom. i. p. 362, 383, 617.)]

      But the national enmity, at least the effects of that enmity, had
      been suspended by a truce, which continued above fourscore years.
      An ambassador from the emperor Zeno accompanied the rash and
      unfortunate Perozes, 1321 in his expedition against the
      Nepthalites, 1322 or white Huns, whose conquests had been
      stretched from the Caspian to the heart of India, whose throne
      was enriched with emeralds, 133 and whose cavalry was supported
      by a line of two thousand elephants. 134 The Persians 1341 were
      twice circumvented, in a situation which made valor useless and
      flight impossible; and the double victory of the Huns was
      achieved by military stratagem. They dismissed their royal
      captive after he had submitted to adore the majesty of a
      Barbarian; and the humiliation was poorly evaded by the
      casuistical subtlety of the Magi, who instructed Perozes to
      direct his attention to the rising sun. 1342 The indignant
      successor of Cyrus forgot his danger and his gratitude; he
      renewed the attack with headstrong fury, and lost both his army
      and his life. 135 The death of Perozes abandoned Persia to her
      foreign and domestic enemies; 1351 and twelve years of confusion
      elapsed before his son Cabades, or Kobad, could embrace any
      designs of ambition or revenge. The unkind parsimony of
      Anastasius was the motive or pretence of a Roman war; 136 the
      Huns and Arabs marched under the Persian standard, and the
      fortifications of Armenia and Mesopotamia were, at that time, in
      a ruinous or imperfect condition. The emperor returned his thanks
      to the governor and people of Martyropolis for the prompt
      surrender of a city which could not be successfully defended, and
      the conflagration of Theodosiopolis might justify the conduct of
      their prudent neighbors. Amida sustained a long and destructive
      siege: at the end of three months the loss of fifty thousand of
      the soldiers of Cabades was not balanced by any prospect of
      success, and it was in vain that the Magi deduced a flattering
      prediction from the indecency of the women 1361 on the ramparts,
      who had revealed their most secret charms to the eyes of the
      assailants. At length, in a silent night, they ascended the most
      accessible tower, which was guarded only by some monks,
      oppressed, after the duties of a festival, with sleep and wine.
      Scaling-ladders were applied at the dawn of day; the presence of
      Cabades, his stern command, and his drawn sword, compelled the
      Persians to vanquish; and before it was sheathed, fourscore
      thousand of the inhabitants had expiated the blood of their
      companions. After the siege of Amida, the war continued three
      years, and the unhappy frontier tasted the full measure of its
      calamities. The gold of Anastasius was offered too late, the
      number of his troops was defeated by the number of their
      generals; the country was stripped of its inhabitants, and both
      the living and the dead were abandoned to the wild beasts of the
      desert. The resistance of Edessa, and the deficiency of spoil,
      inclined the mind of Cabades to peace: he sold his conquests for
      an exorbitant price; and the same line, though marked with
      slaughter and devastation, still separated the two empires. To
      avert the repetition of the same evils, Anastasius resolved to
      found a new colony, so strong, that it should defy the power of
      the Persian, so far advanced towards Assyria, that its stationary
      troops might defend the province by the menace or operation of
      offensive war. For this purpose, the town of Dara, 137 fourteen
      miles from Nisibis, and four days’ journey from the Tigris, was
      peopled and adorned; the hasty works of Anastasius were improved
      by the perseverance of Justinian; and, without insisting on
      places less important, the fortifications of Dara may represent
      the military architecture of the age. The city was surrounded
      with two walls, and the interval between them, of fifty paces,
      afforded a retreat to the cattle of the besieged. The inner wall
      was a monument of strength and beauty: it measured sixty feet
      from the ground, and the height of the towers was one hundred
      feet; the loopholes, from whence an enemy might be annoyed with
      missile weapons, were small, but numerous; the soldiers were
      planted along the rampart, under the shelter of double galleries,
      and a third platform, spacious and secure, was raised on the
      summit of the towers. The exterior wall appears to have been less
      lofty, but more solid; and each tower was protected by a
      quadrangular bulwark. A hard, rocky soil resisted the tools of
      the miners, and on the south-east, where the ground was more
      tractable, their approach was retarded by a new work, which
      advanced in the shape of a half-moon. The double and treble
      ditches were filled with a stream of water; and in the management
      of the river, the most skilful labor was employed to supply the
      inhabitants, to distress the besiegers, and to prevent the
      mischiefs of a natural or artificial inundation. Dara continued
      more than sixty years to fulfil the wishes of its founders, and
      to provoke the jealousy of the Persians, who incessantly
      complained, that this impregnable fortress had been constructed
      in manifest violation of the treaty of peace between the two
      empires. 1371

      1371 (return) [ The situation (of Dara) does not appear to give
      it strength, as it must have been commanded on three sides by the
      mountains, but opening on the south towards the plains of
      Mesopotamia. The foundation of the walls and towers, built of
      large hewn stone, may be traced across the valley, and over a
      number of low rocky hills which branch out from the foot of Mount
      Masius. The circumference I conceive to be nearly two miles and a
      half; and a small stream, which flows through the middle of the
      place, has induced several Koordish and Armenian families to fix
      their residence within the ruins. Besides the walls and towers,
      the remains of many other buildings attest the former grandeur of
      Dara; a considerable part of the space within the walls is arched
      and vaulted underneath, and in one place we perceived a large
      cavern, supported by four ponderous columns, somewhat resembling
      the great cistern of Constantinople. In the centre of the village
      are the ruins of a palace (probably that mentioned by Procopius)
      or church, one hundred paces in length, and sixty in breadth. The
      foundations, which are quite entire, consist of a prodigious
      number of subterraneous vaulted chambers, entered by a narrow
      passage forty paces in length. The gate is still standing; a
      considerable part of the wall has bid defiance to time, &c. M
      Donald Kinneir’s Journey, p. 438.—M]

      Between the Euxine and the Caspian, the countries of Colchos,
      Iberia, and Albania, are intersected in every direction by the
      branches of Mount Caucasus; and the two principal gates, or
      passes, from north to south, have been frequently confounded in
      the geography both of the ancients and moderns. The name of
      Caspian or Albanian gates is properly applied to Derbend, 138
      which occupies a short declivity between the mountains and the
      sea: the city, if we give credit to local tradition, had been
      founded by the Greeks; and this dangerous entrance was fortified
      by the kings of Persia with a mole, double walls, and doors of
      iron. The Iberian gates 139 1391 are formed by a narrow passage
      of six miles in Mount Caucasus, which opens from the northern
      side of Iberia, or Georgia, into the plain that reaches to the
      Tanais and the Volga. A fortress, designed by Alexander perhaps,
      or one of his successors, to command that important pass, had
      descended by right of conquest or inheritance to a prince of the
      Huns, who offered it for a moderate price to the emperor; but
      while Anastasius paused, while he timorously computed the cost
      and the distance, a more vigilant rival interposed, and Cabades
      forcibly occupied the Straits of Caucasus. The Albanian and
      Iberian gates excluded the horsemen of Scythia from the shortest
      and most practicable roads, and the whole front of the mountains
      was covered by the rampart of Gog and Magog, the long wall which
      has excited the curiosity of an Arabian caliph 140 and a Russian
      conqueror. 141 According to a recent description, huge stones,
      seven feet thick, and twenty-one feet in length or height, are
      artificially joined without iron or cement, to compose a wall,
      which runs above three hundred miles from the shores of Derbend,
      over the hills, and through the valleys of Daghestan and Georgia.

      Without a vision, such a work might be undertaken by the policy
      of Cabades; without a miracle, it might be accomplished by his
      son, so formidable to the Romans, under the name of Chosroes; so
      dear to the Orientals, under the appellation of Nushirwan. The
      Persian monarch held in his hand the keys both of peace and war;
      but he stipulated, in every treaty, that Justinian should
      contribute to the expense of a common barrier, which equally
      protected the two empires from the inroads of the Scythians. 142

      in length.]

      D’Herbelot, (p. 682.)] VII. Justinian suppressed the schools of
      Athens and the consulship of Rome, which had given so many sages
      and heroes to mankind. Both these institutions had long since
      degenerated from their primitive glory; yet some reproach may be
      justly inflicted on the avarice and jealousy of a prince, by
      whose hand such venerable ruins were destroyed.

      Athens, after her Persian triumphs, adopted the philosophy of
      Ionia and the rhetoric of Sicily; and these studies became the
      patrimony of a city, whose inhabitants, about thirty thousand
      males, condensed, within the period of a single life, the genius
      of ages and millions. Our sense of the dignity of human nature is
      exalted by the simple recollection, that Isocrates 143 was the
      companion of Plato and Xenophon; that he assisted, perhaps with
      the historian Thucydides, at the first representation of the
      Oedipus of Sophocles and the Iphigenia of Euripides; and that his
      pupils Aeschines and Demosthenes contended for the crown of
      patriotism in the presence of Aristotle, the master of
      Theophrastus, who taught at Athens with the founders of the Stoic
      and Epicurean sects. 144 The ingenuous youth of Attica enjoyed
      the benefits of their domestic education, which was communicated
      without envy to the rival cities. Two thousand disciples heard
      the lessons of Theophrastus; 145 the schools of rhetoric must
      have been still more populous than those of philosophy; and a
      rapid succession of students diffused the fame of their teachers
      as far as the utmost limits of the Grecian language and name.
      Those limits were enlarged by the victories of Alexander; the
      arts of Athens survived her freedom and dominion; and the Greek
      colonies which the Macedonians planted in Egypt, and scattered
      over Asia, undertook long and frequent pilgrimages to worship the
      Muses in their favorite temple on the banks of the Ilissus. The
      Latin conquerors respectfully listened to the instructions of
      their subjects and captives; the names of Cicero and Horace were
      enrolled in the schools of Athens; and after the perfect
      settlement of the Roman empire, the natives of Italy, of Africa,
      and of Britain, conversed in the groves of the academy with their
      fellow-students of the East. The studies of philosophy and
      eloquence are congenial to a popular state, which encourages the
      freedom of inquiry, and submits only to the force of persuasion.
      In the republics of Greece and Rome, the art of speaking was the
      powerful engine of patriotism or ambition; and the schools of
      rhetoric poured forth a colony of statesmen and legislators. When
      the liberty of public debate was suppressed, the orator, in the
      honorable profession of an advocate, might plead the cause of
      innocence and justice; he might abuse his talents in the more
      profitable trade of panegyric; and the same precepts continued to
      dictate the fanciful declamations of the sophist, and the chaster
      beauties of historical composition. The systems which professed
      to unfold the nature of God, of man, and of the universe,
      entertained the curiosity of the philosophic student; and
      according to the temper of his mind, he might doubt with the
      Sceptics, or decide with the Stoics, sublimely speculate with
      Plato, or severely argue with Aristotle. The pride of the adverse
      sects had fixed an unattainable term of moral happiness and
      perfection; but the race was glorious and salutary; the disciples
      of Zeno, and even those of Epicurus, were taught both to act and
      to suffer; and the death of Petronius was not less effectual than
      that of Seneca, to humble a tyrant by the discovery of his
      impotence. The light of science could not indeed be confined
      within the walls of Athens. Her incomparable writers address
      themselves to the human race; the living masters emigrated to
      Italy and Asia; Berytus, in later times, was devoted to the study
      of the law; astronomy and physic were cultivated in the musaeum
      of Alexandria; but the Attic schools of rhetoric and philosophy
      maintained their superior reputation from the Peloponnesian war
      to the reign of Justinian. Athens, though situate in a barren
      soil, possessed a pure air, a free navigation, and the monuments
      of ancient art. That sacred retirement was seldom disturbed by
      the business of trade or government; and the last of the
      Athenians were distinguished by their lively wit, the purity of
      their taste and language, their social manners, and some traces,
      at least in discourse, of the magnanimity of their fathers. In
      the suburbs of the city, the academy of the Platonists, the
      lycaeum of the Peripatetics, the portico of the Stoics, and the
      garden of the Epicureans, were planted with trees and decorated
      with statues; and the philosophers, instead of being immured in a
      cloister, delivered their instructions in spacious and pleasant
      walks, which, at different hours, were consecrated to the
      exercises of the mind and body. The genius of the founders still
      lived in those venerable seats; the ambition of succeeding to the
      masters of human reason excited a generous emulation; and the
      merit of the candidates was determined, on each vacancy, by the
      free voices of an enlightened people. The Athenian professors
      were paid by their disciples: according to their mutual wants and
      abilities, the price appears to have varied; and Isocrates
      himself, who derides the avarice of the sophists, required, in
      his school of rhetoric, about thirty pounds from each of his
      hundred pupils. The wages of industry are just and honorable, yet
      the same Isocrates shed tears at the first receipt of a stipend:
      the Stoic might blush when he was hired to preach the contempt of
      money; and I should be sorry to discover that Aristotle or Plato
      so far degenerated from the example of Socrates, as to exchange
      knowledge for gold. But some property of lands and houses was
      settled by the permission of the laws, and the legacies of
      deceased friends, on the philosophic chairs of Athens. Epicurus
      bequeathed to his disciples the gardens which he had purchased
      for eighty minae or two hundred and fifty pounds, with a fund
      sufficient for their frugal subsistence and monthly festivals;
      146 and the patrimony of Plato afforded an annual rent, which, in
      eight centuries, was gradually increased from three to one
      thousand pieces of gold. 147 The schools of Athens were protected
      by the wisest and most virtuous of the Roman princes. The
      library, which Hadrian founded, was placed in a portico adorned
      with pictures, statues, and a roof of alabaster, and supported by
      one hundred columns of Phrygian marble. The public salaries were
      assigned by the generous spirit of the Antonines; and each
      professor of politics, of rhetoric, of the Platonic, the
      Peripatetic, the Stoic, and the Epicurean philosophy, received an
      annual stipend of ten thousand drachmae, or more than three
      hundred pounds sterling. 148 After the death of Marcus, these
      liberal donations, and the privileges attached to the thrones of
      science, were abolished and revived, diminished and enlarged; but
      some vestige of royal bounty may be found under the successors of
      Constantine; and their arbitrary choice of an unworthy candidate
      might tempt the philosophers of Athens to regret the days of
      independence and poverty. 149 It is remarkable, that the
      impartial favor of the Antonines was bestowed on the four adverse
      sects of philosophy, which they considered as equally useful, or
      at least, as equally innocent. Socrates had formerly been the
      glory and the reproach of his country; and the first lessons of
      Epicurus so strangely scandalized the pious ears of the
      Athenians, that by his exile, and that of his antagonists, they
      silenced all vain disputes concerning the nature of the gods. But
      in the ensuing year they recalled the hasty decree, restored the
      liberty of the schools, and were convinced by the experience of
      ages, that the moral character of philosophers is not affected by
      the diversity of their theological speculations. 150

      The Gothic arms were less fatal to the schools of Athens than the
      establishment of a new religion, whose ministers superseded the
      exercise of reason, resolved every question by an article of
      faith, and condemned the infidel or sceptic to eternal flames. In
      many a volume of laborious controversy, they exposed the weakness
      of the understanding and the corruption of the heart, insulted
      human nature in the sages of antiquity, and proscribed the spirit
      of philosophical inquiry, so repugnant to the doctrine, or at
      least to the temper, of an humble believer. The surviving sects
      of the Platonists, whom Plato would have blushed to acknowledge,
      extravagantly mingled a sublime theory with the practice of
      superstition and magic; and as they remained alone in the midst
      of a Christian world, they indulged a secret rancor against the
      government of the church and state, whose severity was still
      suspended over their heads. About a century after the reign of
      Julian, 151 Proclus 152 was permitted to teach in the philosophic
      chair of the academy; and such was his industry, that he
      frequently, in the same day, pronounced five lessons, and
      composed seven hundred lines. His sagacious mind explored the
      deepest questions of morals and metaphysics, and he ventured to
      urge eighteen arguments against the Christian doctrine of the
      creation of the world. But in the intervals of study, he
      personally conversed with Pan, Aesculapius, and Minerva, in whose
      mysteries he was secretly initiated, and whose prostrate statues
      he adored; in the devout persuasion that the philosopher, who is
      a citizen of the universe, should be the priest of its various
      deities. An eclipse of the sun announced his approaching end; and
      his life, with that of his scholar Isidore, 153 compiled by two
      of their most learned disciples, exhibits a deplorable picture of
      the second childhood of human reason. Yet the golden chain, as it
      was fondly styled, of the Platonic succession, continued
      forty-four years from the death of Proclus to the edict of
      Justinian, 154 which imposed a perpetual silence on the schools
      of Athens, and excited the grief and indignation of the few
      remaining votaries of Grecian science and superstition. Seven
      friends and philosophers, Diogenes and Hermias, Eulalius and
      Priscian, Damascius, Isidore, and Simplicius, who dissented from
      the religion of their sovereign, embraced the resolution of
      seeking in a foreign land the freedom which was denied in their
      native country. They had heard, and they credulously believed,
      that the republic of Plato was realized in the despotic
      government of Persia, and that a patriot king reigned ever the
      happiest and most virtuous of nations. They were soon astonished
      by the natural discovery, that Persia resembled the other
      countries of the globe; that Chosroes, who affected the name of a
      philosopher, was vain, cruel, and ambitious; that bigotry, and a
      spirit of intolerance, prevailed among the Magi; that the nobles
      were haughty, the courtiers servile, and the magistrates unjust;
      that the guilty sometimes escaped, and that the innocent were
      often oppressed. The disappointment of the philosophers provoked
      them to overlook the real virtues of the Persians; and they were
      scandalized, more deeply perhaps than became their profession,
      with the plurality of wives and concubines, the incestuous
      marriages, and the custom of exposing dead bodies to the dogs and
      vultures, instead of hiding them in the earth, or consuming them
      with fire. Their repentance was expressed by a precipitate
      return, and they loudly declared that they had rather die on the
      borders of the empire, than enjoy the wealth and favor of the
      Barbarian. From this journey, however, they derived a benefit
      which reflects the purest lustre on the character of Chosroes. He
      required, that the seven sages who had visited the court of
      Persia should be exempted from the penal laws which Justinian
      enacted against his Pagan subjects; and this privilege, expressly
      stipulated in a treaty of peace, was guarded by the vigilance of
      a powerful mediator. 155 Simplicius and his companions ended
      their lives in peace and obscurity; and as they left no
      disciples, they terminate the long list of Grecian philosophers,
      who may be justly praised, notwithstanding their defects, as the
      wisest and most virtuous of their contemporaries. The writings of
      Simplicius are now extant. His physical and metaphysical
      commentaries on Aristotle have passed away with the fashion of
      the times; but his moral interpretation of Epictetus is preserved
      in the library of nations, as a classic book, most excellently
      adapted to direct the will, to purify the heart, and to confirm
      the understanding, by a just confidence in the nature both of God
      and man.

      About the same time that Pythagoras first invented the
      appellation of philosopher, liberty and the consulship were
      founded at Rome by the elder Brutus. The revolutions of the
      consular office, which may be viewed in the successive lights of
      a substance, a shadow, and a name, have been occasionally
      mentioned in the present History. The first magistrates of the
      republic had been chosen by the people, to exercise, in the
      senate and in the camp, the powers of peace and war, which were
      afterwards translated to the emperors. But the tradition of

      Gothic historian applauds the consulship of Theodoric as the
      height of all temporal glory and greatness; 156 the king of Italy
      himself congratulated those annual favorites of fortune who,
      without the cares, enjoyed the splendor of the throne; and at the
      end of a thousand years, two consuls were created by the
      sovereigns of Rome and Constantinople, for the sole purpose of
      giving a date to the year, and a festival to the people. But the
      expenses of this festival, in which the wealthy and the vain
      aspired to surpass their predecessors, insensibly arose to the
      enormous sum of fourscore thousand pounds; the wisest senators
      declined a useless honor, which involved the certain ruin of
      their families, and to this reluctance I should impute the
      frequent chasms in the last age of the consular Fasti. The
      predecessors of Justinian had assisted from the public treasures
      the dignity of the less opulent candidates; the avarice of that
      prince preferred the cheaper and more convenient method of advice
      and regulation. 157 Seven processions or spectacles were the
      number to which his edict confined the horse and chariot races,
      the athletic sports, the music, and pantomimes of the theatre,
      and the hunting of wild beasts; and small pieces of silver were
      discreetly substituted to the gold medals, which had always
      excited tumult and drunkenness, when they were scattered with a
      profuse hand among the populace. Notwithstanding these
      precautions, and his own example, the succession of consuls
      finally ceased in the thirteenth year of Justinian, whose
      despotic temper might be gratified by the silent extinction of a
      title which admonished the Romans of their ancient freedom. 158
      Yet the annual consulship still lived in the minds of the people;
      they fondly expected its speedy restoration; they applauded the
      gracious condescension of successive princes, by whom it was
      assumed in the first year of their reign; and three centuries
      elapsed, after the death of Justinian, before that obsolete
      dignity, which had been suppressed by custom, could be abolished
      by law. 159 The imperfect mode of distinguishing each year by the
      name of a magistrate, was usefully supplied by the date of a
      permanent aera: the creation of the world, according to the
      Septuagint version, was adopted by the Greeks; 160 and the
      Latins, since the age of Charlemagne, have computed their time
      from the birth of Christ. 161

      ignorance and darkness; 2000 either fabulous or doubtful; 1000 of
      ancient history, commencing with the Persian empire, and the
      Republics of Rome and Athens; 1000 from the fall of the Roman
      empire in the West to the discovery of America; and the remaining
      296 will almost complete three centuries of the modern state of
      Europe and mankind. I regret this chronology, so far preferable
      to our double and perplexed method of counting backwards and
      forwards the years before and after the Christian era.]
