Chapter XXXV: Invasion By Attila.—Part I.

     Invasion Of Gaul By Attila.—He Is Repulsed By Ætius And The
     Visigoths.—Attila Invades And Evacuates Italy.—The Deaths Of
     Attila, Ætius, And Valentinian The Third.

      It was the opinion of Marcian, that war should be avoided, as
      long as it is possible to preserve a secure and honorable peace;
      but it was likewise his opinion, that peace cannot be honorable
      or secure, if the sovereign betrays a pusillanimous aversion to
      war. This temperate courage dictated his reply to the demands of
      Attila, who insolently pressed the payment of the annual tribute.
      The emperor signified to the Barbarians, that they must no longer
      insult the majesty of Rome by the mention of a tribute; that he
      was disposed to reward, with becoming liberality, the faithful
      friendship of his allies; but that, if they presumed to violate
      the public peace, they should feel that he possessed troops, and
      arms, and resolution, to repel their attacks. The same language,
      even in the camp of the Huns, was used by his ambassador
      Apollonius, whose bold refusal to deliver the presents, till he
      had been admitted to a personal interview, displayed a sense of
      dignity, and a contempt of danger, which Attila was not prepared
      to expect from the degenerate Romans. 1 He threatened to chastise
      the rash successor of Theodosius; but he hesitated whether he
      should first direct his invincible arms against the Eastern or
      the Western empire. While mankind awaited his decision with awful
      suspense, he sent an equal defiance to the courts of Ravenna and
      Constantinople; and his ministers saluted the two emperors with
      the same haughty declaration. “Attila, my lord, and thy lord,
      commands thee to provide a palace for his immediate reception.” 2
      But as the Barbarian despised, or affected to despise, the Romans
      of the East, whom he had so often vanquished, he soon declared
      his resolution of suspending the easy conquest, till he had
      achieved a more glorious and important enterprise. In the
      memorable invasions of Gaul and Italy, the Huns were naturally
      attracted by the wealth and fertility of those provinces; but the
      particular motives and provocations of Attila can only be
      explained by the state of the Western empire under the reign of
      Valentinian, or, to speak more correctly, under the
      administration of Ætius. 3

      introduces this haughty message, during the lifetime of
      Theodosius, may have anticipated the date; but the dull annalist
      was incapable of inventing the original and genuine style of
      Attila.]

      3 (return) [ The second book of the Histoire Critique de
      l’Etablissement de la Monarchie Francoise tom. i. p. 189-424,
      throws great light on the state of Gaul, when it was invaded by
      Attila; but the ingenious author, the Abbe Dubos, too often
      bewilders himself in system and conjecture.]

      After the death of his rival Boniface, Ætius had prudently
      retired to the tents of the Huns; and he was indebted to their
      alliance for his safety and his restoration. Instead of the
      suppliant language of a guilty exile, he solicited his pardon at
      the head of sixty thousand Barbarians; and the empress Placidia
      confessed, by a feeble resistance, that the condescension, which
      might have been ascribed to clemency, was the effect of weakness
      or fear. She delivered herself, her son Valentinian, and the
      Western empire, into the hands of an insolent subject; nor could
      Placidia protect the son-in-law of Boniface, the virtuous and
      faithful Sebastian, 4 from the implacable persecution which urged
      him from one kingdom to another, till he miserably perished in
      the service of the Vandals. The fortunate Ætius, who was
      immediately promoted to the rank of patrician, and thrice
      invested with the honors of the consulship, assumed, with the
      title of master of the cavalry and infantry, the whole military
      power of the state; and he is sometimes styled, by contemporary
      writers, the duke, or general, of the Romans of the West. His
      prudence, rather than his virtue, engaged him to leave the
      grandson of Theodosius in the possession of the purple; and
      Valentinian was permitted to enjoy the peace and luxury of Italy,
      while the patrician appeared in the glorious light of a hero and
      a patriot, who supported near twenty years the ruins of the
      Western empire. The Gothic historian ingenuously confesses, that
      Ætius was born for the salvation of the Roman republic; 5 and
      the following portrait, though it is drawn in the fairest colors,
      must be allowed to contain a much larger proportion of truth than
      of flattery. 411 “His mother was a wealthy and noble Italian, and
      his father Gaudentius, who held a distinguished rank in the
      province of Scythia, gradually rose from the station of a
      military domestic, to the dignity of master of the cavalry. Their
      son, who was enrolled almost in his infancy in the guards, was
      given as a hostage, first to Alaric, and afterwards to the Huns;
      412 and he successively obtained the civil and military honors of
      the palace, for which he was equally qualified by superior merit.
      The graceful figure of Ætius was not above the middle stature;
      but his manly limbs were admirably formed for strength, beauty,
      and agility; and he excelled in the martial exercises of managing
      a horse, drawing the bow, and darting the javelin. He could
      patiently endure the want of food, or of sleep; and his mind and
      body were alike capable of the most laborious efforts. He
      possessed the genuine courage that can despise not only dangers,
      but injuries: and it was impossible either to corrupt, or
      deceive, or intimidate the firm integrity of his soul.” 6 The
      Barbarians, who had seated themselves in the Western provinces,
      were insensibly taught to respect the faith and valor of the
      patrician Ætius. He soothed their passions, consulted their
      prejudices, balanced their interests, and checked their ambition.
      611 A seasonable treaty, which he concluded with Genseric,
      protected Italy from the depredations of the Vandals; the
      independent Britons implored and acknowledged his salutary aid;
      the Imperial authority was restored and maintained in Gaul and
      Spain; and he compelled the Franks and the Suevi, whom he had
      vanquished in the field, to become the useful confederates of the
      republic.

      4 (return) [ Victor Vitensis (de Persecut. Vandal. l. i. 6, p. 8,
      edit. Ruinart) calls him, acer consilio et strenuus in bello: but
      his courage, when he became unfortunate, was censured as
      desperate rashness; and Sebastian deserved, or obtained, the
      epithet of proeceps, (Sidon. Apollinar Carmen ix. 181.) His
      adventures in Constantinople, in Sicily, Gaul, Spain, and Africa,
      are faintly marked in the Chronicles of Marcellinus and Idatius.
      In his distress he was always followed by a numerous train; since
      he could ravage the Hellespont and Propontis, and seize the city
      of Barcelona.]

      411 (return) [ Some valuable fragments of a poetical panegyric on
      Ætius by Merobaudes, a Spaniard, have been recovered from a

      The poet speaks in glowing terms of the long (annosa) peace
      enjoyed under the administration of Ætius. The verses are very
      spirited. The poet was rewarded by a statue publicly dedicated to
      his honor in Rome.

      interest, of Renatus, to magnify the virtues of Ætius; but he
      would have shown more dexterity if he had not insisted on his
      patient, forgiving disposition.]

      From a principle of interest, as well as gratitude, Ætius
      assiduously cultivated the alliance of the Huns. While he resided
      in their tents as a hostage, or an exile, he had familiarly
      conversed with Attila himself, the nephew of his benefactor; and
      the two famous antagonists appeared to have been connected by a
      personal and military friendship, which they afterwards confirmed
      by mutual gifts, frequent embassies, and the education of
      Carpilio, the son of Ætius, in the camp of Attila. By the
      specious professions of gratitude and voluntary attachment, the
      patrician might disguise his apprehensions of the Scythian
      conqueror, who pressed the two empires with his innumerable
      armies. His demands were obeyed or eluded. When he claimed the
      spoils of a vanquished city, some vases of gold, which had been
      fraudulently embezzled, the civil and military governors of
      Noricum were immediately despatched to satisfy his complaints: 7
      and it is evident, from their conversation with Maximin and
      Priscus, in the royal village, that the valor and prudence of
      Ætius had not saved the Western Romans from the common ignominy
      of tribute. Yet his dexterous policy prolonged the advantages of
      a salutary peace; and a numerous army of Huns and Alani, whom he
      had attached to his person, was employed in the defence of Gaul.
      Two colonies of these Barbarians were judiciously fixed in the
      territories of Valens and Orleans; 8 and their active cavalry
      secured the important passages of the Rhone and of the Loire.
      These savage allies were not indeed less formidable to the
      subjects than to the enemies of Rome. Their original settlement
      was enforced with the licentious violence of conquest; and the
      province through which they marched was exposed to all the
      calamities of a hostile invasion. 9 Strangers to the emperor or
      the republic, the Alani of Gaul were devoted to the ambition of
      Ætius, and though he might suspect, that, in a contest with
      Attila himself, they would revolt to the standard of their
      national king, the patrician labored to restrain, rather than to
      excite, their zeal and resentment against the Goths, the
      Burgundians, and the Franks.

      7 (return) [ The embassy consisted of Count Romulus; of Promotus,
      president of Noricum; and of Romanus, the military duke. They
      were accompanied by Tatullus, an illustrious citizen of Petovio,
      in the same province, and father of Orestes, who had married the
      daughter of Count Romulus. See Priscus, p. 57, 65. Cassiodorus
      (Variar. i. 4) mentions another embassy, which was executed by
      his father and Carpilio, the son of Ætius; and, as Attila was no
      more, he could safely boast of their manly, intrepid behavior in
      his presence.]

      in the ulterior Gaul were assigned to the Alani. Without
      admitting the correction of Dubos, (tom. i. p. 300,) the
      reasonable supposition of two colonies or garrisons of Alani will
      confirm his arguments, and remove his objections.]

      9 (return) [ See Prosper. Tyro, p. 639. Sidonius (Panegyr. Avit.
      246) complains, in the name of Auvergne, his native country,

     Litorius Scythicos equites tunc forte subacto Celsus Aremorico,
     Geticum rapiebat in agmen Per terras, Averne, tuas, qui proxima
     quaedue Discursu, flammis, ferro, feritate, rapinis, Delebant;
     pacis fallentes nomen inane.

      another poet, Paulinus of Perigord, confirms the complaint:—

     Nam socium vix ferre queas, qui durior hoste. —-See Dubos, tom. i.
     p. 330.]

      The kingdom established by the Visigoths in the southern
      provinces of Gaul, had gradually acquired strength and maturity;
      and the conduct of those ambitious Barbarians, either in peace or
      war, engaged the perpetual vigilance of Ætius. After the death
      of Wallia, the Gothic sceptre devolved to Theodoric, the son of
      the great Alaric; 10 and his prosperous reign of more than thirty
      years, over a turbulent people, may be allowed to prove, that his
      prudence was supported by uncommon vigor, both of mind and body.
      Impatient of his narrow limits, Theodoric aspired to the
      possession of Arles, the wealthy seat of government and commerce;
      but the city was saved by the timely approach of Ætius; and the
      Gothic king, who had raised the siege with some loss and
      disgrace, was persuaded, for an adequate subsidy, to divert the
      martial valor of his subjects in a Spanish war. Yet Theodoric
      still watched, and eagerly seized, the favorable moment of
      renewing his hostile attempts. The Goths besieged Narbonne, while
      the Belgic provinces were invaded by the Burgundians; and the
      public safety was threatened on every side by the apparent union
      of the enemies of Rome. On every side, the activity of Ætius,
      and his Scythian cavalry, opposed a firm and successful
      resistance. Twenty thousand Burgundians were slain in battle; and
      the remains of the nation humbly accepted a dependent seat in the
      mountains of Savoy. 11 The walls of Narbonne had been shaken by
      the battering engines, and the inhabitants had endured the last
      extremities of famine, when Count Litorius, approaching in
      silence, and directing each horseman to carry behind him two
      sacks of flour, cut his way through the intrenchments of the
      besiegers. The siege was immediately raised; and the more
      decisive victory, which is ascribed to the personal conduct of
      Ætius himself, was marked with the blood of eight thousand
      Goths. But in the absence of the patrician, who was hastily
      summoned to Italy by some public or private interest, Count
      Litorius succeeded to the command; and his presumption soon
      discovered that far different talents are required to lead a wing
      of cavalry, or to direct the operations of an important war. At
      the head of an army of Huns, he rashly advanced to the gates of
      Thoulouse, full of careless contempt for an enemy whom his
      misfortunes had rendered prudent, and his situation made
      desperate. The predictions of the augurs had inspired Litorius
      with the profane confidence that he should enter the Gothic
      capital in triumph; and the trust which he reposed in his Pagan
      allies, encouraged him to reject the fair conditions of peace,
      which were repeatedly proposed by the bishops in the name of
      Theodoric. The king of the Goths exhibited in his distress the
      edifying contrast of Christian piety and moderation; nor did he
      lay aside his sackcloth and ashes till he was prepared to arm for
      the combat. His soldiers, animated with martial and religious
      enthusiasm, assaulted the camp of Litorius. The conflict was
      obstinate; the slaughter was mutual. The Roman general, after a
      total defeat, which could be imputed only to his unskilful
      rashness, was actually led through the streets of Thoulouse, not
      in his own, but in a hostile triumph; and the misery which he
      experienced, in a long and ignominious captivity, excited the
      compassion of the Barbarians themselves. 12 Such a loss, in a
      country whose spirit and finances were long since exhausted,
      could not easily be repaired; and the Goths, assuming, in their
      turn, the sentiments of ambition and revenge, would have planted
      their victorious standards on the banks of the Rhone, if the
      presence of Ætius had not restored strength and discipline to
      the Romans. 13 The two armies expected the signal of a decisive
      action; but the generals, who were conscious of each other’s
      force, and doubtful of their own superiority, prudently sheathed
      their swords in the field of battle; and their reconciliation was
      permanent and sincere. Theodoric, king of the Visigoths, appears
      to have deserved the love of his subjects, the confidence of his
      allies, and the esteem of mankind. His throne was surrounded by
      six valiant sons, who were educated with equal care in the
      exercises of the Barbarian camp, and in those of the Gallic
      schools: from the study of the Roman jurisprudence, they acquired
      the theory, at least, of law and justice; and the harmonious
      sense of Virgil contributed to soften the asperity of their
      native manners. 14 The two daughters of the Gothic king were
      given in marriage to the eldest sons of the kings of the Suevi
      and of the Vandals, who reigned in Spain and Africa: but these
      illustrious alliances were pregnant with guilt and discord. The
      queen of the Suevi bewailed the death of a husband inhumanly
      massacred by her brother. The princess of the Vandals was the
      victim of a jealous tyrant, whom she called her father. The cruel
      Genseric suspected that his son’s wife had conspired to poison
      him; the supposed crime was punished by the amputation of her
      nose and ears; and the unhappy daughter of Theodoric was
      ignominiously returned to the court of Thoulouse in that deformed
      and mutilated condition. This horrid act, which must seem
      incredible to a civilized age drew tears from every spectator;
      but Theodoric was urged, by the feelings of a parent and a king,
      to revenge such irreparable injuries. The Imperial ministers, who
      always cherished the discord of the Barbarians, would have
      supplied the Goths with arms, and ships, and treasures, for the
      African war; and the cruelty of Genseric might have been fatal to
      himself, if the artful Vandal had not armed, in his cause, the
      formidable power of the Huns. His rich gifts and pressing
      solicitations inflamed the ambition of Attila; and the designs of
      Ætius and Theodoric were prevented by the invasion of Gaul. 15

      The Franks, whose monarchy was still confined to the neighborhood
      of the Lower Rhine, had wisely established the right of
      hereditary succession in the noble family of the Merovingians. 16
      These princes were elevated on a buckler, the symbol of military
      command; 17 and the royal fashion of long hair was the ensign of
      their birth and dignity. Their flaxen locks, which they combed
      and dressed with singular care, hung down in flowing ringlets on
      their back and shoulders; while the rest of the nation were
      obliged, either by law or custom, to shave the hinder part of
      their head, to comb their hair over the forehead, and to content
      themselves with the ornament of two small whiskers. 18 The lofty
      stature of the Franks, and their blue eyes, denoted a Germanic
      origin; their close apparel accurately expressed the figure of
      their limbs; a weighty sword was suspended from a broad belt;
      their bodies were protected by a large shield; and these warlike
      Barbarians were trained, from their earliest youth, to run, to
      leap, to swim; to dart the javelin, or battle-axe, with unerring
      aim; to advance, without hesitation, against a superior enemy;
      and to maintain, either in life or death, the invincible
      reputation of their ancestors. 19 Clodion, the first of their
      long-haired kings, whose name and actions are mentioned in
      authentic history, held his residence at Dispargum, 20 a village
      or fortress, whose place may be assigned between Louvain and
      Brussels. From the report of his spies, the king of the Franks
      was informed, that the defenceless state of the second Belgic
      must yield, on the slightest attack, to the valor of his
      subjects. He boldly penetrated through the thickets and morasses
      of the Carbonarian forest; 21 occupied Tournay and Cambray, the
      only cities which existed in the fifth century, and extended his
      conquests as far as the River Somme, over a desolate country,
      whose cultivation and populousness are the effects of more recent
      industry. 22 While Clodion lay encamped in the plains of Artois,
      23 and celebrated, with vain and ostentatious security, the
      marriage, perhaps, of his son, the nuptial feast was interrupted
      by the unexpected and unwelcome presence of Ætius, who had
      passed the Somme at the head of his light cavalry. The tables,
      which had been spread under the shelter of a hill, along the
      banks of a pleasant stream, were rudely overturned; the Franks
      were oppressed before they could recover their arms, or their
      ranks; and their unavailing valor was fatal only to themselves.
      The loaded wagons, which had followed their march, afforded a
      rich booty; and the virgin-bride, with her female attendants,
      submitted to the new lovers, who were imposed on them by the
      chance of war. This advance, which had been obtained by the skill
      and activity of Ætius, might reflect some disgrace on the
      military prudence of Clodion; but the king of the Franks soon
      regained his strength and reputation, and still maintained the
      possession of his Gallic kingdom from the Rhine to the Somme. 24
      Under his reign, and most probably from the enterprising spirit
      of his subjects, his three capitals, Mentz, Treves, and Cologne,
      experienced the effects of hostile cruelty and avarice. The
      distress of Cologne was prolonged by the perpetual dominion of
      the same Barbarians, who evacuated the ruins of Treves; and
      Treves, which in the space of forty years had been four times
      besieged and pillaged, was disposed to lose the memory of her
      afflictions in the vain amusements of the Circus. 25 The death of
      Clodion, after a reign of twenty years, exposed his kingdom to
      the discord and ambition of his two sons. Meroveus, the younger,
      26 was persuaded to implore the protection of Rome; he was
      received at the Imperial court, as the ally of Valentinian, and
      the adopted son of the patrician Ætius; and dismissed to his
      native country, with splendid gifts, and the strongest assurances
      of friendship and support. During his absence, his elder brother
      had solicited, with equal ardor, the formidable aid of Attila;
      and the king of the Huns embraced an alliance, which facilitated
      the passage of the Rhine, and justified, by a specious and
      honorable pretence, the invasion of Gaul. 27

      Chapter XXXV: Invasion By Attila.—Part II.

      When Attila declared his resolution of supporting the cause of
      his allies, the Vandals and the Franks, at the same time, and
      almost in the spirit of romantic chivalry, the savage monarch
      professed himself the lover and the champion of the princess
      Honoria. The sister of Valentinian was educated in the palace of
      Ravenna; and as her marriage might be productive of some danger
      to the state, she was raised, by the title of Augusta, 28 above
      the hopes of the most presumptuous subject. But the fair Honoria
      had no sooner attained the sixteenth year of her age, than she
      detested the importunate greatness which must forever exclude her
      from the comforts of honorable love; in the midst of vain and
      unsatisfactory pomp, Honoria sighed, yielded to the impulse of
      nature, and threw herself into the arms of her chamberlain
      Eugenius. Her guilt and shame (such is the absurd language of
      imperious man) were soon betrayed by the appearances of
      pregnancy; but the disgrace of the royal family was published to
      the world by the imprudence of the empress Placidia who dismissed
      her daughter, after a strict and shameful confinement, to a
      remote exile at Constantinople. The unhappy princess passed
      twelve or fourteen years in the irksome society of the sisters of
      Theodosius, and their chosen virgins; to whose crown Honoria
      could no longer aspire, and whose monastic assiduity of prayer,
      fasting, and vigils, she reluctantly imitated. Her impatience of
      long and hopeless celibacy urged her to embrace a strange and
      desperate resolution. The name of Attila was familiar and
      formidable at Constantinople; and his frequent embassies
      entertained a perpetual intercourse between his camp and the
      Imperial palace. In the pursuit of love, or rather of revenge,
      the daughter of Placidia sacrificed every duty and every
      prejudice; and offered to deliver her person into the arms of a
      Barbarian, of whose language she was ignorant, whose figure was
      scarcely human, and whose religion and manners she abhorred. By
      the ministry of a faithful eunuch, she transmitted to Attila a
      ring, the pledge of her affection; and earnestly conjured him to
      claim her as a lawful spouse, to whom he had been secretly
      betrothed. These indecent advances were received, however, with
      coldness and disdain; and the king of the Huns continued to
      multiply the number of his wives, till his love was awakened by
      the more forcible passions of ambition and avarice. The invasion
      of Gaul was preceded, and justified, by a formal demand of the
      princess Honoria, with a just and equal share of the Imperial
      patrimony. His predecessors, the ancient Tanjous, had often
      addressed, in the same hostile and peremptory manner, the
      daughters of China; and the pretensions of Attila were not less
      offensive to the majesty of Rome. A firm, but temperate, refusal
      was communicated to his ambassadors. The right of female
      succession, though it might derive a specious argument from the
      recent examples of Placidia and Pulcheria, was strenuously
      denied; and the indissoluble engagements of Honoria were opposed
      to the claims of her Scythian lover. 29 On the discovery of her
      connection with the king of the Huns, the guilty princess had
      been sent away, as an object of horror, from Constantinople to
      Italy: her life was spared; but the ceremony of her marriage was
      performed with some obscure and nominal husband, before she was
      immured in a perpetual prison, to bewail those crimes and
      misfortunes, which Honoria might have escaped, had she not been
      born the daughter of an emperor. 30

      they cannot be made consistent, or probable, unless we separate,
      by an interval of time and place, her intrigue with Eugenius, and
      her invitation of Attila.]

      A native of Gaul, and a contemporary, the learned and eloquent
      Sidonius, who was afterwards bishop of Clermont, had made a
      promise to one of his friends, that he would compose a regular
      history of the war of Attila. If the modesty of Sidonius had not
      discouraged him from the prosecution of this interesting work, 31
      the historian would have related, with the simplicity of truth,
      those memorable events, to which the poet, in vague and doubtful
      metaphors, has concisely alluded. 32 The kings and nations of
      Germany and Scythia, from the Volga perhaps to the Danube, obeyed
      the warlike summons of Attila. From the royal village, in the
      plains of Hungary his standard moved towards the West; and after
      a march of seven or eight hundred miles, he reached the conflux
      of the Rhine and the Neckar, where he was joined by the Franks,
      who adhered to his ally, the elder of the sons of Clodion. A
      troop of light Barbarians, who roamed in quest of plunder, might
      choose the winter for the convenience of passing the river on the
      ice; but the innumerable cavalry of the Huns required such plenty
      of forage and provisions, as could be procured only in a milder
      season; the Hercynian forest supplied materials for a bridge of
      boats; and the hostile myriads were poured, with resistless
      violence, into the Belgic provinces. 33 The consternation of Gaul
      was universal; and the various fortunes of its cities have been
      adorned by tradition with martyrdoms and miracles. 34 Troyes was
      saved by the merits of St. Lupus; St. Servatius was removed from
      the world, that he might not behold the ruin of Tongres; and the
      prayers of St. Genevieve diverted the march of Attila from the
      neighborhood of Paris. But as the greatest part of the Gallic
      cities were alike destitute of saints and soldiers, they were
      besieged and stormed by the Huns; who practised, in the example
      of Metz, 35 their customary maxims of war. They involved, in a
      promiscuous massacre, the priests who served at the altar, and
      the infants, who, in the hour of danger, had been providently
      baptized by the bishop; the flourishing city was delivered to the
      flames, and a solitary chapel of St. Stephen marked the place
      where it formerly stood. From the Rhine and the Moselle, Attila
      advanced into the heart of Gaul; crossed the Seine at Auxerre;
      and, after a long and laborious march, fixed his camp under the
      walls of Orleans. He was desirous of securing his conquests by
      the possession of an advantageous post, which commanded the
      passage of the Loire; and he depended on the secret invitation of
      Sangiban, king of the Alani, who had promised to betray the city,
      and to revolt from the service of the empire. But this
      treacherous conspiracy was detected and disappointed: Orleans had
      been strengthened with recent fortifications; and the assaults of
      the Huns were vigorously repelled by the faithful valor of the
      soldiers, or citizens, who defended the place. The pastoral
      diligence of Anianus, a bishop of primitive sanctity and
      consummate prudence, exhausted every art of religious policy to
      support their courage, till the arrival of the expected succors.
      After an obstinate siege, the walls were shaken by the battering
      rams; the Huns had already occupied the suburbs; and the people,
      who were incapable of bearing arms, lay prostrate in prayer.
      Anianus, who anxiously counted the days and hours, despatched a
      trusty messenger to observe, from the rampart, the face of the
      distant country. He returned twice, without any intelligence that
      could inspire hope or comfort; but, in his third report, he
      mentioned a small cloud, which he had faintly descried at the
      extremity of the horizon. “It is the aid of God!” exclaimed the
      bishop, in a tone of pious confidence; and the whole multitude
      repeated after him, “It is the aid of God.” The remote object, on
      which every eye was fixed, became each moment larger, and more
      distinct; the Roman and Gothic banners were gradually perceived;
      and a favorable wind blowing aside the dust, discovered, in deep
      array, the impatient squadrons of Ætius and Theodoric, who
      pressed forwards to the relief of Orleans.

      At the distance of no more than a hundred years, could he be
      ignorant, could the people be ignorant of the fate of a city, the
      actual residence of his sovereigns, the kings of Austrasia? The
      learned count, who seems to have undertaken the apology of Attila
      and the Barbarians, appeals to the false Idatius, parcens
      Germaniae et Galliae, and forgets that the true Idatius had
      explicitly affirmed, plurimae civitates effractoe, among which he
      enumerates Metz.]

      The facility with which Attila had penetrated into the heart of
      Gaul, may be ascribed to his insidious policy, as well as to the
      terror of his arms. His public declarations were skilfully
      mitigated by his private assurances; he alternately soothed and
      threatened the Romans and the Goths; and the courts of Ravenna
      and Thoulouse, mutually suspicious of each other’s intentions,
      beheld, with supine indifference, the approach of their common
      enemy. Ætius was the sole guardian of the public safety; but his
      wisest measures were embarrassed by a faction, which, since the
      death of Placidia, infested the Imperial palace: the youth of
      Italy trembled at the sound of the trumpet; and the Barbarians,
      who, from fear or affection, were inclined to the cause of
      Attila, awaited with doubtful and venal faith, the event of the
      war. The patrician passed the Alps at the head of some troops,
      whose strength and numbers scarcely deserved the name of an army.
      36 But on his arrival at Arles, or Lyons, he was confounded by
      the intelligence, that the Visigoths, refusing to embrace the
      defence of Gaul, had determined to expect, within their own
      territories, the formidable invader, whom they professed to
      despise. The senator Avitus, who, after the honorable exercise of
      the Prætorian præfecture, had retired to his estate in
      Auvergne, was persuaded to accept the important embassy, which he
      executed with ability and success. He represented to Theodoric,
      that an ambitious conqueror, who aspired to the dominion of the
      earth, could be resisted only by the firm and unanimous alliance
      of the powers whom he labored to oppress. The lively eloquence of
      Avitus inflamed the Gothic warriors, by the description of the
      injuries which their ancestors had suffered from the Huns; whose
      implacable fury still pursued them from the Danube to the foot of
      the Pyrenees. He strenuously urged, that it was the duty of every
      Christian to save, from sacrilegious violation, the churches of
      God, and the relics of the saints: that it was the interest of
      every Barbarian, who had acquired a settlement in Gaul, to defend
      the fields and vineyards, which were cultivated for his use,
      against the desolation of the Scythian shepherds. Theodoric
      yielded to the evidence of truth; adopted the measure at once the
      most prudent and the most honorable; and declared, that, as the
      faithful ally of Ætius and the Romans, he was ready to expose
      his life and kingdom for the common safety of Gaul. 37 The
      Visigoths, who, at that time, were in the mature vigor of their
      fame and power, obeyed with alacrity the signal of war; prepared
      their arms and horses, and assembled under the standard of their
      aged king, who was resolved, with his two eldest sons, Torismond
      and Theodoric, to command in person his numerous and valiant
      people. The example of the Goths determined several tribes or
      nations, that seemed to fluctuate between the Huns and the
      Romans. The indefatigable diligence of the patrician gradually
      collected the troops of Gaul and Germany, who had formerly
      acknowledged themselves the subjects, or soldiers, of the
      republic, but who now claimed the rewards of voluntary service,
      and the rank of independent allies; the Læti, the Armoricans,
      the Breones, the Saxons, the Burgundians, the Sarmatians, or
      Alani, the Ripuarians, and the Franks who followed Meroveus as
      their lawful prince. Such was the various army, which, under the
      conduct of Ætius and Theodoric, advanced, by rapid marches to
      relieve Orleans, and to give battle to the innumerable host of
      Attila. 38

      most favorable light. Yet their agreement when they are fairly
      interpreted, is a proof of their veracity.]

      Historians of France, with the notes of the Benedictine editor.
      The Loeti were a promiscuous race of Barbarians, born or
      naturalized in Gaul; and the Riparii, or Ripuarii, derived their
      name from their post on the three rivers, the Rhine, the Meuse,
      and the Moselle; the Armoricans possessed the independent cities
      between the Seine and the Loire. A colony of Saxons had been
      planted in the diocese of Bayeux; the Burgundians were settled in
      Savoy; and the Breones were a warlike tribe of Rhaetians, to the
      east of the Lake of Constance.]

      On their approach the king of the Huns immediately raised the
      siege, and sounded a retreat to recall the foremost of his troops
      from the pillage of a city which they had already entered. 39 The
      valor of Attila was always guided by his prudence; and as he
      foresaw the fatal consequences of a defeat in the heart of Gaul,
      he repassed the Seine, and expected the enemy in the plains of
      Chalons, whose smooth and level surface was adapted to the
      operations of his Scythian cavalry. But in this tumultuary
      retreat, the vanguard of the Romans and their allies continually
      pressed, and sometimes engaged, the troops whom Attila had posted
      in the rear; the hostile columns, in the darkness of the night
      and the perplexity of the roads, might encounter each other
      without design; and the bloody conflict of the Franks and
      Gepidae, in which fifteen thousand 40 Barbarians were slain, was
      a prelude to a more general and decisive action. The Catalaunian
      fields 41 spread themselves round Chalons, and extend, according
      to the vague measurement of Jornandes, to the length of one
      hundred and fifty, and the breadth of one hundred miles, over the
      whole province, which is entitled to the appellation of a
      champaign country. 42 This spacious plain was distinguished,
      however, by some inequalities of ground; and the importance of a
      height, which commanded the camp of Attila, was understood and
      disputed by the two generals. The young and valiant Torismond
      first occupied the summit; the Goths rushed with irresistible
      weight on the Huns, who labored to ascend from the opposite side:
      and the possession of this advantageous post inspired both the
      troops and their leaders with a fair assurance of victory. The
      anxiety of Attila prompted him to consult his priests and
      haruspices. It was reported, that, after scrutinizing the
      entrails of victims, and scraping their bones, they revealed, in
      mysterious language, his own defeat, with the death of his
      principal adversary; and that the Barbarians, by accepting the
      equivalent, expressed his involuntary esteem for the superior
      merit of Ætius. But the unusual despondency, which seemed to
      prevail among the Huns, engaged Attila to use the expedient, so
      familiar to the generals of antiquity, of animating his troops by
      a military oration; and his language was that of a king, who had
      often fought and conquered at their head. 43 He pressed them to
      consider their past glory, their actual danger, and their future
      hopes. The same fortune, which opened the deserts and morasses of
      Scythia to their unarmed valor, which had laid so many warlike
      nations prostrate at their feet, had reserved the joys of this
      memorable field for the consummation of their victories. The
      cautious steps of their enemies, their strict alliance, and their
      advantageous posts, he artfully represented as the effects, not
      of prudence, but of fear. The Visigoths alone were the strength
      and nerves of the opposite army; and the Huns might securely
      trample on the degenerate Romans, whose close and compact order
      betrayed their apprehensions, and who were equally incapable of
      supporting the dangers or the fatigues of a day of battle. The
      doctrine of predestination, so favorable to martial virtue, was
      carefully inculcated by the king of the Huns; who assured his
      subjects, that the warriors, protected by Heaven, were safe and
      invulnerable amidst the darts of the enemy; but that the unerring
      Fates would strike their victims in the bosom of inglorious
      peace. “I myself,” continued Attila, “will throw the first
      javelin, and the wretch who refuses to imitate the example of his
      sovereign, is devoted to inevitable death.” The spirit of the
      Barbarians was rekindled by the presence, the voice, and the
      example of their intrepid leader; and Attila, yielding to their
      impatience, immediately formed his order of battle. At the head
      of his brave and faithful Huns, he occupied in person the centre
      of the line. The nations subject to his empire, the Rugians, the
      Heruli, the Thuringians, the Franks, the Burgundians, were
      extended on either hand, over the ample space of the Catalaunian
      fields; the right wing was commanded by Ardaric, king of the
      Gepidae; and the three valiant brothers, who reigned over the
      Ostrogoths, were posted on the left to oppose the kindred tribes
      of the Visigoths. The disposition of the allies was regulated by
      a different principle. Sangiban, the faithless king of the Alani,
      was placed in the centre, where his motions might be strictly
      watched, and that the treachery might be instantly punished.
      Ætius assumed the command of the left, and Theodoric of the
      right wing; while Torismond still continued to occupy the heights
      which appear to have stretched on the flank, and perhaps the
      rear, of the Scythian army. The nations from the Volga to the
      Atlantic were assembled on the plain of Chalons; but many of
      these nations had been divided by faction, or conquest, or
      emigration; and the appearance of similar arms and ensigns, which
      threatened each other, presented the image of a civil war.

      had served under Attila, might repeat his discourse to
      Cassiodorus; the ideas, and even the expressions, have an
      original Scythian cast; and I doubt, whether an Italian of the
      sixth century would have thought of the hujus certaminis gaudia.]

      The discipline and tactics of the Greeks and Romans form an
      interesting part of their national manners. The attentive study
      of the military operations of Xenophon, or Caesar, or Frederic,
      when they are described by the same genius which conceived and
      executed them, may tend to improve (if such improvement can be
      wished) the art of destroying the human species. But the battle
      of Chalons can only excite our curiosity by the magnitude of the
      object; since it was decided by the blind impetuosity of
      Barbarians, and has been related by partial writers, whose civil
      or ecclesiastical profession secluded them from the knowledge of
      military affairs. Cassiolorus, however, had familiarly conversed
      with many Gothic warriors, who served in that memorable
      engagement; “a conflict,” as they informed him, “fierce, various,
      obstinate, and bloody; such as could not be paralleled either in
      the present or in past ages.” The number of the slain amounted to
      one hundred and sixty-two thousand, or, according to another
      account, three hundred thousand persons; 44 and these incredible
      exaggerations suppose a real and effective loss sufficient to
      justify the historian’s remark, that whole generations may be
      swept away by the madness of kings, in the space of a single
      hour. After the mutual and repeated discharge of missile weapons,
      in which the archers of Scythia might signalize their superior
      dexterity, the cavalry and infantry of the two armies were
      furiously mingled in closer combat. The Huns, who fought under
      the eyes of their king pierced through the feeble and doubtful
      centre of the allies, separated their wings from each other, and
      wheeling, with a rapid effort, to the left, directed their whole
      force against the Visigoths. As Theodoric rode along the ranks,
      to animate his troops, he received a mortal stroke from the
      javelin of Andages, a noble Ostrogoth, and immediately fell from
      his horse. The wounded king was oppressed in the general
      disorder, and trampled under the feet of his own cavalry; and
      this important death served to explain the ambiguous prophecy of
      the haruspices. Attila already exulted in the confidence of
      victory, when the valiant Torismond descended from the hills, and
      verified the remainder of the prediction. The Visigoths, who had
      been thrown into confusion by the flight or defection of the
      Alani, gradually restored their order of battle; and the Huns
      were undoubtedly vanquished, since Attila was compelled to
      retreat. He had exposed his person with the rashness of a private
      soldier; but the intrepid troops of the centre had pushed
      forwards beyond the rest of the line; their attack was faintly
      supported; their flanks were unguarded; and the conquerors of
      Scythia and Germany were saved by the approach of the night from
      a total defeat. They retired within the circle of wagons that
      fortified their camp; and the dismounted squadrons prepared
      themselves for a defence, to which neither their arms, nor their
      temper, were adapted. The event was doubtful: but Attila had
      secured a last and honorable resource. The saddles and rich
      furniture of the cavalry were collected, by his order, into a
      funeral pile; and the magnanimous Barbarian had resolved, if his
      intrenchments should be forced, to rush headlong into the flames,
      and to deprive his enemies of the glory which they might have
      acquired, by the death or captivity of Attila. 45

      into two great battles; the former near Orleans, the latter in
      Champagne: in the one, Theodoric was slain in the other, he was
      revenged.]

      But his enemies had passed the night in equal disorder and
      anxiety. The inconsiderate courage of Torismond was tempted to
      urge the pursuit, till he unexpectedly found himself, with a few
      followers, in the midst of the Scythian wagons. In the confusion
      of a nocturnal combat, he was thrown from his horse; and the
      Gothic prince must have perished like his father, if his youthful
      strength, and the intrepid zeal of his companions, had not
      rescued him from this dangerous situation. In the same manner,
      but on the left of the line, Ætius himself, separated from his
      allies, ignorant of their victory, and anxious for their fate,
      encountered and escaped the hostile troops that were scattered
      over the plains of Chalons; and at length reached the camp of the
      Goths, which he could only fortify with a slight rampart of
      shields, till the dawn of day. The Imperial general was soon
      satisfied of the defeat of Attila, who still remained inactive
      within his intrenchments; and when he contemplated the bloody
      scene, he observed, with secret satisfaction, that the loss had
      principally fallen on the Barbarians. The body of Theodoric,
      pierced with honorable wounds, was discovered under a heap of the
      slain: his subjects bewailed the death of their king and father;
      but their tears were mingled with songs and acclamations, and his
      funeral rites were performed in the face of a vanquished enemy.
      The Goths, clashing their arms, elevated on a buckler his eldest
      son Torismond, to whom they justly ascribed the glory of their
      success; and the new king accepted the obligation of revenge as a
      sacred portion of his paternal inheritance. Yet the Goths
      themselves were astonished by the fierce and undaunted aspect of
      their formidable antagonist; and their historian has compared
      Attila to a lion encompassed in his den, and threatening his
      hunters with redoubled fury. The kings and nations who might have
      deserted his standard in the hour of distress, were made sensible
      that the displeasure of their monarch was the most imminent and
      inevitable danger. All his instruments of martial music
      incessantly sounded a loud and animating strain of defiance; and
      the foremost troops who advanced to the assault were checked or
      destroyed by showers of arrows from every side of the
      intrenchments. It was determined, in a general council of war, to
      besiege the king of the Huns in his camp, to intercept his
      provisions, and to reduce him to the alternative of a disgraceful
      treaty or an unequal combat. But the impatience of the Barbarians
      soon disdained these cautious and dilatory measures; and the
      mature policy of Ætius was apprehensive that, after the
      extirpation of the Huns, the republic would be oppressed by the
      pride and power of the Gothic nation. The patrician exerted the
      superior ascendant of authority and reason to calm the passions,
      which the son of Theodoric considered as a duty; represented,
      with seeming affection and real truth, the dangers of absence and
      delay and persuaded Torismond to disappoint, by his speedy
      return, the ambitious designs of his brothers, who might occupy
      the throne and treasures of Thoulouse. 46 After the departure of
      the Goths, and the separation of the allied army, Attila was
      surprised at the vast silence that reigned over the plains of
      Chalons: the suspicion of some hostile stratagem detained him
      several days within the circle of his wagons, and his retreat
      beyond the Rhine confessed the last victory which was achieved in
      the name of the Western empire. Meroveus and his Franks,
      observing a prudent distance, and magnifying the opinion of their
      strength by the numerous fires which they kindled every night,
      continued to follow the rear of the Huns till they reached the
      confines of Thuringia. The Thuringians served in the army of
      Attila: they traversed, both in their march and in their return,
      the territories of the Franks; and it was perhaps in this war
      that they exercised the cruelties which, about fourscore years
      afterwards, were revenged by the son of Clovis. They massacred
      their hostages, as well as their captives: two hundred young
      maidens were tortured with exquisite and unrelenting rage; their
      bodies were torn asunder by wild horses, or their bones were
      crushed under the weight of rolling wagons; and their unburied
      limbs were abandoned on the public roads, as a prey to dogs and
      vultures. Such were those savage ancestors, whose imaginary
      virtues have sometimes excited the praise and envy of civilized
      ages. 47

      46 (return) [ Jornandes de Rebus Geticis, c. 41, p. 671. The
      policy of Ætius, and the behavior of Torismond, are extremely

      ii. c. 7, p. 163,) dismissed the prince of the Franks, by
      suggesting to him a similar apprehension. The false Idatius
      ridiculously pretends, that Ætius paid a clandestine nocturnal
      visit to the kings of the Huns and of the Visigoths; from each of
      whom he obtained a bribe of ten thousand pieces of gold, as the
      price of an undisturbed retreat.]

      Attila. His residence in Thuringia was long attested by popular
      tradition; and he is supposed to have assembled a couroultai, or
      diet, in the territory of Eisenach. See Mascou, ix. 30, who
      settles with nice accuracy the extent of ancient Thuringia, and
      derives its name from the Gothic tribe of the Therungi]




      Chapter XXXV: Invasion By Attila.—Part III.

      Neither the spirit, nor the forces, nor the reputation, of
      Attila, were impaired by the failure of the Gallic expedition. In
      the ensuing spring he repeated his demand of the princess
      Honoria, and her patrimonial treasures. The demand was again
      rejected, or eluded; and the indignant lover immediately took the
      field, passed the Alps, invaded Italy, and besieged Aquileia with
      an innumerable host of Barbarians. Those Barbarians were
      unskilled in the methods of conducting a regular siege, which,
      even among the ancients, required some knowledge, or at least
      some practice, of the mechanic arts. But the labor of many
      thousand provincials and captives, whose lives were sacrificed
      without pity, might execute the most painful and dangerous work.
      The skill of the Roman artists might be corrupted to the
      destruction of their country. The walls of Aquileia were
      assaulted by a formidable train of battering rams, movable
      turrets, and engines, that threw stones, darts, and fire; 48 and
      the monarch of the Huns employed the forcible impulse of hope,
      fear, emulation, and interest, to subvert the only barrier which
      delayed the conquest of Italy. Aquileia was at that period one of
      the richest, the most populous, and the strongest of the maritime
      cities of the Adriatic coast. The Gothic auxiliaries, who
      appeared to have served under their native princes, Alaric and
      Antala, communicated their intrepid spirit; and the citizens
      still remembered the glorious and successful resistance which
      their ancestors had opposed to a fierce, inexorable Barbarian,
      who disgraced the majesty of the Roman purple. Three months were
      consumed without effect in the siege of the Aquileia; till the
      want of provisions, and the clamors of his army, compelled Attila
      to relinquish the enterprise; and reluctantly to issue his
      orders, that the troops should strike their tents the next
      morning, and begin their retreat. But as he rode round the walls,
      pensive, angry, and disappointed, he observed a stork preparing
      to leave her nest, in one of the towers, and to fly with her
      infant family towards the country. He seized, with the ready
      penetration of a statesman, this trifling incident, which chance
      had offered to superstition; and exclaimed, in a loud and
      cheerful tone, that such a domestic bird, so constantly attached
      to human society, would never have abandoned her ancient seats,
      unless those towers had been devoted to impending ruin and
      solitude. 49 The favorable omen inspired an assurance of victory;
      the siege was renewed and prosecuted with fresh vigor; a large
      breach was made in the part of the wall from whence the stork had
      taken her flight; the Huns mounted to the assault with
      irresistible fury; and the succeeding generation could scarcely
      discover the ruins of Aquileia. 50 After this dreadful
      chastisement, Attila pursued his march; and as he passed, the
      cities of Altinum, Concordia, and Padua, were reduced into heaps
      of stones and ashes. The inland towns, Vicenza, Verona, and
      Bergamo, were exposed to the rapacious cruelty of the Huns. Milan
      and Pavia submitted, without resistance, to the loss of their
      wealth; and applauded the unusual clemency which preserved from
      the flames the public, as well as private, buildings, and spared
      the lives of the captive multitude. The popular traditions of
      Comum, Turin, or Modena, may justly be suspected; yet they concur
      with more authentic evidence to prove, that Attila spread his
      ravages over the rich plains of modern Lombardy; which are
      divided by the Po, and bounded by the Alps and Apennine. 51 When
      he took possession of the royal palace of Milan, he was surprised
      and offended at the sight of a picture which represented the
      Caesars seated on their throne, and the princes of Scythia
      prostrate at their feet. The revenge which Attila inflicted on
      this monument of Roman vanity, was harmless and ingenious. He
      commanded a painter to reverse the figures and the attitudes; and
      the emperors were delineated on the same canvas, approaching in a
      suppliant posture to empty their bags of tributary gold before
      the throne of the Scythian monarch. 52 The spectators must have
      confessed the truth and propriety of the alteration; and were
      perhaps tempted to apply, on this singular occasion, the
      well-known fable of the dispute between the lion and the man. 53

      impotent conclusion.]

      It is a saying worthy of the ferocious pride of Attila, that the
      grass never grew on the spot where his horse had trod. Yet the
      savage destroyer undesignedly laid the foundation of a republic,
      which revived, in the feudal state of Europe, the art and spirit
      of commercial industry. The celebrated name of Venice, or
      Venetia, 54 was formerly diffused over a large and fertile
      province of Italy, from the confines of Pannonia to the River
      Addua, and from the Po to the Rhaetian and Julian Alps. Before
      the irruption of the Barbarians, fifty Venetian cities flourished
      in peace and prosperity: Aquileia was placed in the most
      conspicuous station: but the ancient dignity of Padua was
      supported by agriculture and manufactures; and the property of
      five hundred citizens, who were entitled to the equestrian rank,
      must have amounted, at the strictest computation, to one million
      seven hundred thousand pounds. Many families of Aquileia, Padua,
      and the adjacent towns, who fled from the sword of the Huns,
      found a safe, though obscure, refuge in the neighboring islands.
      55 At the extremity of the Gulf, where the Adriatic feebly
      imitates the tides of the ocean, near a hundred small islands are
      separated by shallow water from the continent, and protected from
      the waves by several long slips of land, which admit the entrance
      of vessels through some secret and narrow channels. 56 Till the
      middle of the fifth century, these remote and sequestered spots
      remained without cultivation, with few inhabitants, and almost
      without a name. But the manners of the Venetian fugitives, their
      arts and their government, were gradually formed by their new
      situation; and one of the epistles of Cassiodorus, 57 which
      describes their condition about seventy years afterwards, may be
      considered as the primitive monument of the republic. 571 The
      minister of Theodoric compares them, in his quaint declamatory
      style, to water-fowl, who had fixed their nests on the bosom of
      the waves; and though he allows, that the Venetian provinces had
      formerly contained many noble families, he insinuates, that they
      were now reduced by misfortune to the same level of humble
      poverty. Fish was the common, and almost the universal, food of
      every rank: their only treasure consisted in the plenty of salt,
      which they extracted from the sea: and the exchange of that
      commodity, so essential to human life, was substituted in the
      neighboring markets to the currency of gold and silver. A people,
      whose habitations might be doubtfully assigned to the earth or
      water, soon became alike familiar with the two elements; and the
      demands of avarice succeeded to those of necessity. The
      islanders, who, from Grado to Chiozza, were intimately connected
      with each other, penetrated into the heart of Italy, by the
      secure, though laborious, navigation of the rivers and inland
      canals. Their vessels, which were continually increasing in size
      and number, visited all the harbors of the Gulf; and the marriage
      which Venice annually celebrates with the Adriatic, was
      contracted in her early infancy. The epistle of Cassiodorus, the
      Prætorian præfect, is addressed to the maritime tribunes; and
      he exhorts them, in a mild tone of authority, to animate the zeal
      of their countrymen for the public service, which required their
      assistance to transport the magazines of wine and oil from the
      province of Istria to the royal city of Ravenna. The ambiguous
      office of these magistrates is explained by the tradition, that,
      in the twelve principal islands, twelve tribunes, or judges, were
      created by an annual and popular election. The existence of the
      Venetian republic under the Gothic kingdom of Italy, is attested
      by the same authentic record, which annihilates their lofty claim
      of original and perpetual independence. 58

      inhabited the islands scattered upon the coast, and that from
      thence arose the names of Venetia prima and secunda, of which the
      first applied to the main land and the second to the islands and
      lagunes. From the time of the Pelasgi and of the Etrurians, the

      The Italians, who had long since renounced the exercise of arms,
      were surprised, after forty years’ peace, by the approach of a
      formidable Barbarian, whom they abhorred, as the enemy of their
      religion, as well as of their republic. Amidst the general
      consternation, Ætius alone was incapable of fear; but it was
      impossible that he should achieve, alone and unassisted, any
      military exploits worthy of his former renown. The Barbarians who
      had defended Gaul, refused to march to the relief of Italy; and
      the succors promised by the Eastern emperor were distant and
      doubtful. Since Ætius, at the head of his domestic troops, still
      maintained the field, and harassed or retarded the march of
      Attila, he never showed himself more truly great, than at the
      time when his conduct was blamed by an ignorant and ungrateful
      people. 59 If the mind of Valentinian had been susceptible of any
      generous sentiments, he would have chosen such a general for his
      example and his guide. But the timid grandson of Theodosius,
      instead of sharing the dangers, escaped from the sound of war;
      and his hasty retreat from Ravenna to Rome, from an impregnable
      fortress to an open capital, betrayed his secret intention of
      abandoning Italy, as soon as the danger should approach his
      Imperial person. This shameful abdication was suspended, however,
      by the spirit of doubt and delay, which commonly adheres to
      pusillanimous counsels, and sometimes corrects their pernicious
      tendency. The Western emperor, with the senate and people of
      Rome, embraced the more salutary resolution of deprecating, by a
      solemn and suppliant embassy, the wrath of Attila. This important
      commission was accepted by Avienus, who, from his birth and
      riches, his consular dignity, the numerous train of his clients,
      and his personal abilities, held the first rank in the Roman
      senate. The specious and artful character of Avienus 60 was
      admirably qualified to conduct a negotiation either of public or
      private interest: his colleague Trigetius had exercised the
      Prætorian præfecture of Italy; and Leo, bishop of Rome,
      consented to expose his life for the safety of his flock. The
      genius of Leo 61 was exercised and displayed in the public
      misfortunes; and he has deserved the appellation of Great, by the
      successful zeal with which he labored to establish his opinions
      and his authority, under the venerable names of orthodox faith
      and ecclesiastical discipline. The Roman ambassadors were
      introduced to the tent of Attila, as he lay encamped at the place
      where the slow-winding Mincius is lost in the foaming waves of
      the Lake Benacus, 62 and trampled, with his Scythian cavalry, the
      farms of Catullus and Virgil. 63 The Barbarian monarch listened
      with favorable, and even respectful, attention; and the
      deliverance of Italy was purchased by the immense ransom, or
      dowry, of the princess Honoria. The state of his army might
      facilitate the treaty, and hasten his retreat. Their martial
      spirit was relaxed by the wealth and idolence of a warm climate.
      The shepherds of the North, whose ordinary food consisted of milk
      and raw flesh, indulged themselves too freely in the use of
      bread, of wine, and of meat, prepared and seasoned by the arts of
      cookery; and the progress of disease revenged in some measure the
      injuries of the Italians. 64 When Attila declared his resolution
      of carrying his victorious arms to the gates of Rome, he was
      admonished by his friends, as well as by his enemies, that Alaric
      had not long survived the conquest of the eternal city. His mind,
      superior to real danger, was assaulted by imaginary terrors; nor
      could he escape the influence of superstition, which had so often
      been subservient to his designs. 65 The pressing eloquence of
      Leo, his majestic aspect and sacerdotal robes, excited the
      veneration of Attila for the spiritual father of the Christians.
      The apparition of the two apostles, St. Peter and St. Paul, who
      menaced the Barbarian with instant death, if he rejected the
      prayer of their successor, is one of the noblest legends of
      ecclesiastical tradition. The safety of Rome might deserve the
      interposition of celestial beings; and some indulgence is due to
      a fable, which has been represented by the pencil of Raphael, and
      the chisel of Algardi. 66

      Before the king of the Huns evacuated Italy, he threatened to
      return more dreadful, and more implacable, if his bride, the
      princess Honoria, were not delivered to his ambassadors within
      the term stipulated by the treaty. Yet, in the mean while, Attila
      relieved his tender anxiety, by adding a beautiful maid, whose
      name was Ildico, to the list of his innumerable wives. 67 Their
      marriage was celebrated with barbaric pomp and festivity, at his
      wooden palace beyond the Danube; and the monarch, oppressed with
      wine and sleep, retired at a late hour from the banquet to the
      nuptial bed. His attendants continued to respect his pleasures,
      or his repose, the greatest part of the ensuing day, till the
      unusual silence alarmed their fears and suspicions; and, after
      attempting to awaken Attila by loud and repeated cries, they at
      length broke into the royal apartment. They found the trembling
      bride sitting by the bedside, hiding her face with her veil, and
      lamenting her own danger, as well as the death of the king, who
      had expired during the night. 68 An artery had suddenly burst:
      and as Attila lay in a supine posture, he was suffocated by a
      torrent of blood, which, instead of finding a passage through the
      nostrils, regurgitated into the lungs and stomach. His body was
      solemnly exposed in the midst of the plain, under a silken
      pavilion; and the chosen squadrons of the Huns, wheeling round in
      measured evolutions, chanted a funeral song to the memory of a
      hero, glorious in his life, invincible in his death, the father
      of his people, the scourge of his enemies, and the terror of the
      world. According to their national custom, the Barbarians cut off
      a part of their hair, gashed their faces with unseemly wounds,
      and bewailed their valiant leader as he deserved, not with the
      tears of women, but with the blood of warriors. The remains of
      Attila were enclosed within three coffins, of gold, of silver,
      and of iron, and privately buried in the night: the spoils of
      nations were thrown into his grave; the captives who had opened
      the ground were inhumanly massacred; and the same Huns, who had
      indulged such excessive grief, feasted, with dissolute and
      intemperate mirth, about the recent sepulchre of their king. It
      was reported at Constantinople, that on the fortunate night on
      which he expired, Marcian beheld in a dream the bow of Attila
      broken asunder: and the report may be allowed to prove, how
      seldom the image of that formidable Barbarian was absent from the
      mind of a Roman emperor. 69

      The revolution which subverted the empire of the Huns,
      established the fame of Attila, whose genius alone had sustained
      the huge and disjointed fabric. After his death, the boldest
      chieftains aspired to the rank of kings; the most powerful kings
      refused to acknowledge a superior; and the numerous sons, whom so
      many various mothers bore to the deceased monarch, divided and
      disputed, like a private inheritance, the sovereign command of
      the nations of Germany and Scythia. The bold Ardaric felt and
      represented the disgrace of this servile partition; and his
      subjects, the warlike Gepidae, with the Ostrogoths, under the
      conduct of three valiant brothers, encouraged their allies to
      vindicate the rights of freedom and royalty. In a bloody and
      decisive conflict on the banks of the River Netad, in Pannonia,
      the lance of the Gepidae, the sword of the Goths, the arrows of
      the Huns, the Suevic infantry, the light arms of the Heruli, and
      the heavy weapons of the Alani, encountered or supported each
      other; and the victory of the Ardaric was accompanied with the
      slaughter of thirty thousand of his enemies. Ellac, the eldest
      son of Attila, lost his life and crown in the memorable battle of
      Netad: his early valor had raised him to the throne of the
      Acatzires, a Scythian people, whom he subdued; and his father,
      who loved the superior merit, would have envied the death of
      Ellac. 70 His brother, Dengisich, with an army of Huns, still
      formidable in their flight and ruin, maintained his ground above
      fifteen years on the banks of the Danube. The palace of Attila,
      with the old country of Dacia, from the Carpathian hills to the
      Euxine, became the seat of a new power, which was erected by
      Ardaric, king of the Gepidae. The Pannonian conquests from Vienna
      to Sirmium, were occupied by the Ostrogoths; and the settlements
      of the tribes, who had so bravely asserted their native freedom,
      were irregularly distributed, according to the measure of their
      respective strength. Surrounded and oppressed by the multitude of
      his father’s slaves, the kingdom of Dengisich was confined to the
      circle of his wagons; his desperate courage urged him to invade
      the Eastern empire: he fell in battle; and his head ignominiously
      exposed in the Hippodrome, exhibited a grateful spectacle to the
      people of Constantinople. Attila had fondly or superstitiously
      believed, that Irnac, the youngest of his sons, was destined to
      perpetuate the glories of his race. The character of that prince,
      who attempted to moderate the rashness of his brother Dengisich,
      was more suitable to the declining condition of the Huns; and
      Irnac, with his subject hordes, retired into the heart of the
      Lesser Scythia. They were soon overwhelmed by a torrent of new
      Barbarians, who followed the same road which their own ancestors
      had formerly discovered. The Geougen, or Avares, whose residence
      is assigned by the Greek writers to the shores of the ocean,
      impelled the adjacent tribes; till at length the Igours of the
      North, issuing from the cold Siberian regions, which produce the
      most valuable furs, spread themselves over the desert, as far as
      the Borysthenes and the Caspian gates; and finally extinguished
      the empire of the Huns. 71

      M. de Guignes, by his extraordinary knowledge of the Chinese
      language and writers. See Hist. des Huns, tom. ii. p. 315-319.]

      Such an event might contribute to the safety of the Eastern
      empire, under the reign of a prince who conciliated the
      friendship, without forfeiting the esteem, of the Barbarians. But
      the emperor of the West, the feeble and dissolute Valentinian,
      who had reached his thirty-fifth year without attaining the age
      of reason or courage, abused this apparent security, to undermine
      the foundations of his own throne, by the murder of the patrician
      Ætius. From the instinct of a base and jealous mind, he hated
      the man who was universally celebrated as the terror of the
      Barbarians, and the support of the republic; 711 and his new
      favorite, the eunuch Heraclius, awakened the emperor from the
      supine lethargy, which might be disguised, during the life of
      Placidia, 72 by the excuse of filial piety. The fame of Ætius,
      his wealth and dignity, the numerous and martial train of
      Barbarian followers, his powerful dependants, who filled the
      civil offices of the state, and the hopes of his son Gaudentius,
      who was already contracted to Eudoxia, the emperor’s daughter,
      had raised him above the rank of a subject. The ambitious
      designs, of which he was secretly accused, excited the fears, as
      well as the resentment, of Valentinian. Ætius himself, supported
      by the consciousness of his merit, his services, and perhaps his
      innocence, seems to have maintained a haughty and indiscreet
      behavior. The patrician offended his sovereign by a hostile
      declaration; he aggravated the offence, by compelling him to
      ratify, with a solemn oath, a treaty of reconciliation and
      alliance; he proclaimed his suspicions, he neglected his safety;
      and from a vain confidence that the enemy, whom he despised, was
      incapable even of a manly crime, he rashly ventured his person in
      the palace of Rome. Whilst he urged, perhaps with intemperate
      vehemence, the marriage of his son, Valentinian, drawing his
      sword, the first sword he had ever drawn, plunged it in the
      breast of a general who had saved his empire: his courtiers and
      eunuchs ambitiously struggled to imitate their master; and
      Ætius, pierced with a hundred wounds, fell dead in the royal
      presence. Boethius, the Prætorian præfect, was killed at the
      same moment, and before the event could be divulged, the
      principal friends of the patrician were summoned to the palace,
      and separately murdered. The horrid deed, palliated by the
      specious names of justice and necessity, was immediately
      communicated by the emperor to his soldiers, his subjects, and
      his allies. The nations, who were strangers or enemies to Ætius,
      generously deplored the unworthy fate of a hero: the Barbarians,
      who had been attached to his service, dissembled their grief and
      resentment: and the public contempt, which had been so long
      entertained for Valentinian, was at once converted into deep and
      universal abhorrence. Such sentiments seldom pervade the walls of
      a palace; yet the emperor was confounded by the honest reply of a
      Roman, whose approbation he had not disdained to solicit. “I am
      ignorant, sir, of your motives or provocations; I only know, that
      you have acted like a man who cuts off his right hand with his
      left.” 73

      but his position at the time of his murder was certainly that of
      the preserver of the empire, the conqueror of the most dangerous
      of the barbarians: it is by no means clear that he was not
      “innocent” of any treasonable designs against Valentinian. If the
      early acts of his life, the introduction of the Huns into Italy,
      and of the Vandals into Africa, were among the proximate causes
      of the ruin of the empire, his murder was the signal for its
      almost immediate downfall.—M.]

      was buried at Ravenna, where her sepulchre, and even her corpse,
      seated in a chair of cypress wood, were preserved for ages. The
      empress received many compliments from the orthodox clergy; and
      St. Peter Chrysologus assured her, that her zeal for the Trinity
      had been recompensed by an august trinity of children. See
      Tillemont, Uist. Jer Emp. tom. vi. p. 240.]

      73 (return) [ Aetium Placidus mactavit semivir amens, is the
      expression of Sidonius, (Panegyr. Avit. 359.) The poet knew the
      world, and was not inclined to flatter a minister who had injured
      or disgraced Avitus and Majorian, the successive heroes of his
      song.]

      The luxury of Rome seems to have attracted the long and frequent
      visits of Valentinian; who was consequently more despised at Rome
      than in any other part of his dominions. A republican spirit was
      insensibly revived in the senate, as their authority, and even
      their supplies, became necessary for the support of his feeble
      government. The stately demeanor of an hereditary monarch offended
      their pride; and the pleasures of Valentinian were injurious to
      the peace and honor of noble families. The birth of the empress
      Eudoxia was equal to his own, and her charms and tender affection
      deserved those testimonies of love which her inconstant husband
      dissipated in vague and unlawful amours. Petronius Maximus, a
      wealthy senator of the Anician family, who had been twice consul,
      was possessed of a chaste and beautiful wife: her obstinate
      resistance served only to irritate the desires of Valentinian;
      and he resolved to accomplish them, either by stratagem or force.
      Deep gaming was one of the vices of the court: the emperor, who,
      by chance or contrivance, had gained from Maximus a considerable
      sum, uncourteously exacted his ring as a security for the debt;
      and sent it by a trusty messenger to his wife, with an order, in
      her husband’s name, that she should immediately attend the
      empress Eudoxia. The unsuspecting wife of Maximus was conveyed in
      her litter to the Imperial palace; the emissaries of her
      impatient lover conducted her to a remote and silent bed-chamber;
      and Valentinian violated, without remorse, the laws of
      hospitality. Her tears, when she returned home, her deep
      affliction, and her bitter reproaches against a husband whom she
      considered as the accomplice of his own shame, excited Maximus to
      a just revenge; the desire of revenge was stimulated by ambition;
      and he might reasonably aspire, by the free suffrage of the Roman
      senate, to the throne of a detested and despicable rival.
      Valentinian, who supposed that every human breast was devoid,
      like his own, of friendship and gratitude, had imprudently
      admitted among his guards several domestics and followers of
      Ætius. Two of these, of Barbarian race were persuaded to execute
      a sacred and honorable duty, by punishing with death the assassin
      of their patron; and their intrepid courage did not long expect a
      favorable moment. Whilst Valentinian amused himself, in the field
      of Mars, with the spectacle of some military sports, they
      suddenly rushed upon him with drawn weapons, despatched the
      guilty Heraclius, and stabbed the emperor to the heart, without
      the least opposition from his numerous train, who seemed to
      rejoice in the tyrant’s death. Such was the fate of Valentinian
      the Third, 74 the last Roman emperor of the family of Theodosius.
      He faithfully imitated the hereditary weakness of his cousin and
      his two uncles, without inheriting the gentleness, the purity,
      the innocence, which alleviate, in their characters, the want of
      spirit and ability. Valentinian was less excusable, since he had
      passions, without virtues: even his religion was questionable;
      and though he never deviated into the paths of heresy, he
      scandalized the pious Christians by his attachment to the profane
      arts of magic and divination.

      74 (return) [ With regard to the cause and circumstances of the
      deaths of Ætius and Valentinian, our information is dark and
      imperfect. Procopius (de Bell. Vandal. l. i. c. 4, p. 186, 187,
      188) is a fabulous writer for the events which precede his own
      memory. His narrative must therefore be supplied and corrected by
      five or six Chronicles, none of which were composed in Rome or
      Italy; and which can only express, in broken sentences, the
      popular rumors, as they were conveyed to Gaul, Spain, Africa,
      Constantinople, or Alexandria.]

      As early as the time of Cicero and Varro, it was the opinion of
      the Roman augurs, that the twelve vultures which Romulus had
      seen, represented the twelve centuries, assigned for the fatal
      period of his city. 75 This prophecy, disregarded perhaps in the
      season of health and prosperity, inspired the people with gloomy
      apprehensions, when the twelfth century, clouded with disgrace
      and misfortune, was almost elapsed; 76 and even posterity must
      acknowledge with some surprise, that the arbitrary interpretation
      of an accidental or fabulous circumstance has been seriously
      verified in the downfall of the Western empire. But its fall was
      announced by a clearer omen than the flight of vultures: the
      Roman government appeared every day less formidable to its
      enemies, more odious and oppressive to its subjects. 77 The taxes
      were multiplied with the public distress; economy was neglected
      in proportion as it became necessary; and the injustice of the
      rich shifted the unequal burden from themselves to the people,
      whom they defrauded of the indulgences that might sometimes have
      alleviated their misery. The severe inquisition which confiscated
      their goods, and tortured their persons, compelled the subjects
      of Valentinian to prefer the more simple tyranny of the
      Barbarians, to fly to the woods and mountains, or to embrace the
      vile and abject condition of mercenary servants. They abjured and
      abhorred the name of Roman citizens, which had formerly excited
      the ambition of mankind. The Armorican provinces of Gaul, and the
      greatest part of Spain, were-thrown into a state of disorderly
      independence, by the confederations of the Bagaudae; and the
      Imperial ministers pursued with proscriptive laws, and
      ineffectual arms, the rebels whom they had made. 78 If all the
      Barbarian conquerors had been annihilated in the same hour, their
      total destruction would not have restored the empire of the West:
      and if Rome still survived, she survived the loss of freedom, of
      virtue, and of honor.

      was quoted by Varro, in the xviiith book of his Antiquities.

      76 (return) [ According to Varro, the twelfth century would
      expire A.D. 447, but the uncertainty of the true era of Rome
      might allow some latitude of anticipation or delay. The poets of
      the age, Claudian (de Bell Getico, 265) and Sidonius, (in
      Panegyr. Avit. 357,) may be admitted as fair witnesses of the
      popular opinion.

      lamentations and vehement invectives. His immoderate freedom
      serves to prove the weakness, as well as the corruption, of the

      Africa, (A.D. 439,) and before Attila’s war, (A.D. 451.)]
