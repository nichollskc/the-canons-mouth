      When the Arabs first issued from the desert, they must have been
      surprised at the ease and rapidity of their own success. But when
      they advanced in the career of victory to the banks of the Indus
      and the summit of the Pyrenees; when they had repeatedly tried
      the edge of their cimeters and the energy of their faith, they
      might be equally astonished that any nation could resist their
      invincible arms; that any boundary should confine the dominion of
      the successor of the prophet. The confidence of soldiers and
      fanatics may indeed be excused, since the calm historian of the
      present hour, who strives to follow the rapid course of the
      Saracens, must study to explain by what means the church and
      state were saved from this impending, and, as it should seem,
      from this inevitable, danger. The deserts of Scythia and Sarmatia
      might be guarded by their extent, their climate, their poverty,
      and the courage of the northern shepherds; China was remote and
      inaccessible; but the greatest part of the temperate zone was
      subject to the Mahometan conquerors, the Greeks were exhausted by
      the calamities of war and the loss of their fairest provinces,
      and the Barbarians of Europe might justly tremble at the
      precipitate fall of the Gothic monarchy. In this inquiry I shall
      unfold the events that rescued our ancestors of Britain, and our
      neighbors of Gaul, from the civil and religious yoke of the
      Koran; that protected the majesty of Rome, and delayed the
      servitude of Constantinople; that invigorated the defence of the
      Christians, and scattered among their enemies the seeds of
      division and decay.

      Forty-six years after the flight of Mahomet from Mecca, his
      disciples appeared in arms under the walls of Constantinople. 1
      They were animated by a genuine or fictitious saying of the
      prophet, that, to the first army which besieged the city of the
      Caesars, their sins were forgiven: the long series of Roman
      triumphs would be meritoriously transferred to the conquerors of
      New Rome; and the wealth of nations was deposited in this
      well-chosen seat of royalty and commerce. No sooner had the
      caliph Moawiyah suppressed his rivals and established his throne,
      than he aspired to expiate the guilt of civil blood, by the
      success and glory of this holy expedition; 2 his preparations by
      sea and land were adequate to the importance of the object; his
      standard was intrusted to Sophian, a veteran warrior, but the
      troops were encouraged by the example and presence of Yezid, the
      son and presumptive heir of the commander of the faithful. The
      Greeks had little to hope, nor had their enemies any reason of
      fear, from the courage and vigilance of the reigning emperor, who
      disgraced the name of Constantine, and imitated only the
      inglorious years of his grandfather Heraclius. Without delay or
      opposition, the naval forces of the Saracens passed through the
      unguarded channel of the Hellespont, which even now, under the
      feeble and disorderly government of the Turks, is maintained as
      the natural bulwark of the capital. 3 The Arabian fleet cast
      anchor, and the troops were disembarked near the palace of
      Hebdomon, seven miles from the city. During many days, from the
      dawn of light to the evening, the line of assault was extended
      from the golden gate to the eastern promontory and the foremost
      warriors were impelled by the weight and effort of the succeeding
      columns. But the besiegers had formed an insufficient estimate of
      the strength and resources of Constantinople. The solid and lofty
      walls were guarded by numbers and discipline: the spirit of the
      Romans was rekindled by the last danger of their religion and
      empire: the fugitives from the conquered provinces more
      successfully renewed the defence of Damascus and Alexandria; and
      the Saracens were dismayed by the strange and prodigious effects
      of artificial fire. This firm and effectual resistance diverted
      their arms to the more easy attempt of plundering the European
      and Asiatic coasts of the Propontis; and, after keeping the sea
      from the month of April to that of September, on the approach of
      winter they retreated fourscore miles from the capital, to the
      Isle of Cyzicus, in which they had established their magazine of
      spoil and provisions. So patient was their perseverance, or so
      languid were their operations, that they repeated in the six
      following summers the same attack and retreat, with a gradual
      abatement of hope and vigor, till the mischances of shipwreck and
      disease, of the sword and of fire, compelled them to relinquish
      the fruitless enterprise. They might bewail the loss, or
      commemorate the martyrdom, of thirty thousand Moslems, who fell
      in the siege of Constantinople; and the solemn funeral of Abu
      Ayub, or Job, excited the curiosity of the Christians themselves.

      That venerable Arab, one of the last of the companions of
      Mahomet, was numbered among the ansars, or auxiliaries, of
      Medina, who sheltered the head of the flying prophet. In his
      youth he fought, at Beder and Ohud, under the holy standard: in
      his mature age he was the friend and follower of Ali; and the
      last remnant of his strength and life was consumed in a distant
      and dangerous war against the enemies of the Koran. His memory
      was revered; but the place of his burial was neglected and
      unknown, during a period of seven hundred and eighty years, till
      the conquest of Constantinople by Mahomet the Second. A
      seasonable vision (for such are the manufacture of every
      religion) revealed the holy spot at the foot of the walls and the
      bottom of the harbor; and the mosch of Ayub has been deservedly
      chosen for the simple and martial inauguration of the Turkish
      sultans. 4

      Constantinople in the year of our Christian aera, 673 (of the

      years afterwards; a glaring inconsistency! which Petavius, Goar,
      and Pagi, (Critica, tom. iv. p. 63, 64,) have struggled to
      remove. Of the Arabians, the Hegira 52 (A.D. 672, January 8) is
      assigned by Elmacin, the year 48 (A.D. 688, Feb. 20) by Abulfeda,
      whose testimony I esteem the most convenient and credible.]

      to write for the amusement, rather than the instruction, of his

      Constantine was occupied, like that of Mustapha, in finding two
      Canary birds who should sing precisely the same note.]

      The event of the siege revived, both in the East and West, the
      reputation of the Roman arms, and cast a momentary shade over the
      glories of the Saracens. The Greek ambassador was favorably
      received at Damascus, a general council of the emirs or Koreish:
      a peace, or truce, of thirty years was ratified between the two
      empires; and the stipulation of an annual tribute, fifty horses
      of a noble breed, fifty slaves, and three thousand pieces of
      gold, degraded the majesty of the commander of the faithful. 5
      The aged caliph was desirous of possessing his dominions, and
      ending his days in tranquillity and repose: while the Moors and
      Indians trembled at his name, his palace and city of Damascus was
      insulted by the Mardaites, or Maronites, of Mount Libanus, the
      firmest barrier of the empire, till they were disarmed and
      transplanted by the suspicious policy of the Greeks. 6 After the
      revolt of Arabia and Persia, the house of Ommiyah was reduced to
      the kingdoms of Syria and Egypt: their distress and fear enforced
      their compliance with the pressing demands of the Christians; and
      the tribute was increased to a slave, a horse, and a thousand
      pieces of gold, for each of the three hundred and sixty-five days
      of the solar year. But as soon as the empire was again united by
      the arms and policy of Abdalmalek, he disclaimed a badge of
      servitude not less injurious to his conscience than to his pride;
      he discontinued the payment of the tribute; and the resentment of
      the Greeks was disabled from action by the mad tyranny of the
      second Justinian, the just rebellion of his subjects, and the
      frequent change of his antagonists and successors. 7 Till the
      reign of Abdalmalek, the Saracens had been content with the free
      possession of the Persian and Roman treasures, in the coins of
      Chosroes and Caesar. By the command of that caliph, a national
      mint was established, both for silver and gold, and the
      inscription of the Dinar, though it might be censured by some
      timorous casuists, proclaimed the unity of the God of Mahomet. 8
      Under the reign of the caliph Walid, the Greek language and
      characters were excluded from the accounts of the public revenue.
      9 If this change was productive of the invention or familiar use
      of our present numerals, the Arabic or Indian ciphers, as they
      are commonly styled, a regulation of office has promoted the most
      important discoveries of arithmetic, algebra, and the
      mathematical sciences. 10

      5 (return) [ Theophanes, though a Greek, deserves credit for
      these tributes, (Chronograph. p. 295, 296, 300, 301,) which are
      confirmed, with some variation, by the Arabic History of
      Abulpharagius, (Dynast. p. 128, vers. Pocock.)]

      6 (return) [ The censure of Theophanes is just and pointed,
      (Chronograph. p. 302, 303.) The series of these events may be
      traced in the Annals of Theophanes, and in the Abridgment of the
      patriarch Nicephorus, p. 22, 24.]

      7 (return) [ These domestic revolutions are related in a clear
      and natural style, in the second volume of Ockley’s History of
      the Saracens, p. 253-370. Besides our printed authors, he draws
      his materials from the Arabic Mss. of Oxford, which he would have
      more deeply searched had he been confined to the Bodleian library
      instead of the city jail a fate how unworthy of the man and of
      his country!]

      8 (return) [ Elmacin, who dates the first coinage A. H. 76, A.D.
      695, five or six years later than the Greek historians, has
      compared the weight of the best or common gold dinar to the
      drachm or dirhem of Egypt, (p. 77,) which may be equal to two
      pennies (48 grains) of our Troy weight, (Hooper’s Inquiry into
      Ancient Measures, p. 24-36,) and equivalent to eight shillings of
      our sterling money. From the same Elmacin and the Arabian
      physicians, some dinars as high as two dirhems, as low as half a
      dirhem, may be deduced. The piece of silver was the dirhem, both
      in value and weight; but an old, though fair coin, struck at
      Waset, A. H. 88, and preserved in the Bodleian library, wants
      four grains of the Cairo standard, (see the Modern Universal
      History, tom. i. p. 548 of the French translation.) * Note: Up to
      this time the Arabs had used the Roman or the Persian coins or
      had minted others which resembled them. Nevertheless, it has been
      admitted of late years, that the Arabians, before this epoch, had
      caused coin to be minted, on which, preserving the Roman or the
      Persian dies, they added Arabian names or inscriptions. Some of
      these exist in different collections. We learn from Makrizi, an
      Arabian author of great learning and judgment, that in the year
      18 of the Hegira, under the caliphate of Omar, the Arabs had
      coined money of this description. The same author informs us that
      the caliph Abdalmalek caused coins to be struck representing
      himself with a sword by his side. These types, so contrary to the
      notions of the Arabs, were disapproved by the most influential
      persons of the time, and the caliph substituted for them, after
      the year 76 of the Hegira, the Mahometan coins with which we are
      acquainted. Consult, on the question of Arabic numismatics, the
      works of Adler, of Fraehn, of Castiglione, and of Marsden, who
      have treated at length this interesting point of historic
      antiquities. See, also, in the Journal Asiatique, tom. ii. p.
      257, et seq., a paper of M. Silvestre de Sacy, entitled Des
      Monnaies des Khalifes avant l’An 75 de l’Hegire. See, also the
      translation of a German paper on the Arabic medals of the
      Chosroes, by M. Fraehn. in the same Journal Asiatique tom. iv. p.

      really existed, must have stimulated the ingenuity of the Arabs
      to invent or borrow.]

      10 (return) [ According to a new, though probable, notion,
      maintained by M de Villoison, (Anecdota Graeca, tom. ii. p.
      152-157,) our ciphers are not of Indian or Arabic invention. They
      were used by the Greek and Latin arithmeticians long before the
      age of Boethius. After the extinction of science in the West,
      they were adopted by the Arabic versions from the original Mss.,
      and restored to the Latins about the xith century. * Note:

      Whilst the caliph Walid sat idle on the throne of Damascus,
      whilst his lieutenants achieved the conquest of Transoxiana and
      Spain, a third army of Saracens overspread the provinces of Asia
      Minor, and approached the borders of the Byzantine capital. But
      the attempt and disgrace of the second siege was reserved for his
      brother Soliman, whose ambition appears to have been quickened by
      a more active and martial spirit. In the revolutions of the Greek
      empire, after the tyrant Justinian had been punished and avenged,
      an humble secretary, Anastasius or Artemius, was promoted by
      chance or merit to the vacant purple. He was alarmed by the sound
      of war; and his ambassador returned from Damascus with the
      tremendous news, that the Saracens were preparing an armament by
      sea and land, such as would transcend the experience of the past,
      or the belief of the present age. The precautions of Anastasius
      were not unworthy of his station, or of the impending danger. He
      issued a peremptory mandate, that all persons who were not
      provided with the means of subsistence for a three years’ siege
      should evacuate the city: the public granaries and arsenals were
      abundantly replenished; the walls were restored and strengthened;
      and the engines for casting stones, or darts, or fire, were
      stationed along the ramparts, or in the brigantines of war, of
      which an additional number was hastily constructed. To prevent is
      safer, as well as more honorable, than to repel, an attack; and a
      design was meditated, above the usual spirit of the Greeks, of
      burning the naval stores of the enemy, the cypress timber that
      had been hewn in Mount Libanus, and was piled along the sea-shore
      of Phoenicia, for the service of the Egyptian fleet. This
      generous enterprise was defeated by the cowardice or treachery of
      the troops, who, in the new language of the empire, were styled
      of the Obsequian Theme. 11 They murdered their chief, deserted
      their standard in the Isle of Rhodes, dispersed themselves over
      the adjacent continent, and deserved pardon or reward by
      investing with the purple a simple officer of the revenue. The
      name of Theodosius might recommend him to the senate and people;
      but, after some months, he sunk into a cloister, and resigned, to
      the firmer hand of Leo the Isaurian, the urgent defence of the
      capital and empire. The most formidable of the Saracens,
      Moslemah, the brother of the caliph, was advancing at the head of
      one hundred and twenty thousand Arabs and Persians, the greater
      part mounted on horses or camels; and the successful sieges of
      Tyana, Amorium, and Pergamus, were of sufficient duration to
      exercise their skill and to elevate their hopes. At the
      well-known passage of Abydus, on the Hellespont, the Mahometan
      arms were transported, for the first time, 1111 from Asia to
      Europe. From thence, wheeling round the Thracian cities of the
      Propontis, Moslemah invested Constantinople on the land side,
      surrounded his camp with a ditch and rampart, prepared and
      planted his engines of assault, and declared, by words and
      actions, a patient resolution of expecting the return of
      seed-time and harvest, should the obstinacy of the besieged prove
      equal to his own. 1112 The Greeks would gladly have ransomed
      their religion and empire, by a fine or assessment of a piece of
      gold on the head of each inhabitant of the city; but the liberal
      offer was rejected with disdain, and the presumption of Moslemah
      was exalted by the speedy approach and invincible force of the
      natives of Egypt and Syria. They are said to have amounted to
      eighteen hundred ships: the number betrays their inconsiderable
      size; and of the twenty stout and capacious vessels, whose
      magnitude impeded their progress, each was manned with no more
      than one hundred heavy-armed soldiers. This huge armada proceeded
      on a smooth sea, and with a gentle gale, towards the mouth of the
      Bosphorus; the surface of the strait was overshadowed, in the
      language of the Greeks, with a moving forest, and the same fatal
      night had been fixed by the Saracen chief for a general assault
      by sea and land. To allure the confidence of the enemy, the
      emperor had thrown aside the chain that usually guarded the
      entrance of the harbor; but while they hesitated whether they
      should seize the opportunity, or apprehend the snare, the
      ministers of destruction were at hand. The fire-ships of the
      Greeks were launched against them; the Arabs, their arms, and
      vessels, were involved in the same flames; the disorderly
      fugitives were dashed against each other or overwhelmed in the
      waves; and I no longer find a vestige of the fleet, that had
      threatened to extirpate the Roman name. A still more fatal and
      irreparable loss was that of the caliph Soliman, who died of an
      indigestion, 12 in his camp near Kinnisrin or Chalcis in Syria,
      as he was preparing to lead against Constantinople the remaining
      forces of the East. The brother of Moslemah was succeeded by a
      kinsman and an enemy; and the throne of an active and able prince
      was degraded by the useless and pernicious virtues of a bigot.
      1211 While he started and satisfied the scruples of a blind
      conscience, the siege was continued through the winter by the
      neglect, rather than by the resolution of the caliph Omar. 13 The
      winter proved uncommonly rigorous: above a hundred days the
      ground was covered with deep snow, and the natives of the sultry
      climes of Egypt and Arabia lay torpid and almost lifeless in
      their frozen camp. They revived on the return of spring; a second
      effort had been made in their favor; and their distress was
      relieved by the arrival of two numerous fleets, laden with corn,
      and arms, and soldiers; the first from Alexandria, of four
      hundred transports and galleys; the second of three hundred and
      sixty vessels from the ports of Africa. But the Greek fires were
      again kindled; and if the destruction was less complete, it was
      owing to the experience which had taught the Moslems to remain at
      a safe distance, or to the perfidy of the Egyptian mariners, who
      deserted with their ships to the emperor of the Christians. The
      trade and navigation of the capital were restored; and the
      produce of the fisheries supplied the wants, and even the luxury,
      of the inhabitants. But the calamities of famine and disease were
      soon felt by the troops of Moslemah, and as the former was
      miserably assuaged, so the latter was dreadfully propagated, by
      the pernicious nutriment which hunger compelled them to extract
      from the most unclean or unnatural food. The spirit of conquest,
      and even of enthusiasm, was extinct: the Saracens could no longer
      struggle, beyond their lines, either single or in small parties,
      without exposing themselves to the merciless retaliation of the
      Thracian peasants.

      An army of Bulgarians was attracted from the Danube by the gifts
      and promises of Leo; and these savage auxiliaries made some
      atonement for the evils which they had inflicted on the empire,
      by the defeat and slaughter of twenty-two thousand Asiatics. A
      report was dexterously scattered, that the Franks, the unknown
      nations of the Latin world, were arming by sea and land in the
      defence of the Christian cause, and their formidable aid was
      expected with far different sensations in the camp and city. At
      length, after a siege of thirteen months, 14 the hopeless
      Moslemah received from the caliph the welcome permission of
      retreat. 1411 The march of the Arabian cavalry over the
      Hellespont and through the provinces of Asia, was executed
      without delay or molestation; but an army of their brethren had
      been cut in pieces on the side of Bithynia, and the remains of
      the fleet were so repeatedly damaged by tempest and fire, that
      only five galleys entered the port of Alexandria to relate the
      tale of their various and almost incredible disasters. 15

      described by Constantine Porphyrogenitus, (de Thematibus, l. i.
      p. 9, 10,) the Obsequium, a Latin appellation of the army and

      metropolis, and its jurisdiction extended from the Hellespont
      over the adjacent parts of Bithynia and Phrygia, (see the two
      maps prefixed by Delisle to the Imperium Orientale of Banduri.)]

      12 (return) [ The caliph had emptied two baskets of eggs and of

      Mecca, Soliman ate, at a single meal, seventy pomegranates, a
      kid, six fowls, and a huge quantity of the grapes of Tayef. If
      the bill of fare be correct, we must admire the appetite, rather
      than the luxury, of the sovereign of Asia, (Abulfeda, Annal.
      Moslem. p. 126.) * Note: The Tarikh Tebry ascribes the death of
      Soliman to a pleurisy. The same gross gluttony in which Soliman
      indulged, though not fatal to the life, interfered with the
      military duties, of his brother Moslemah. Price, vol. i. p.

      In the two sieges, the deliverance of Constantinople may be
      chiefly ascribed to the novelty, the terrors, and the real
      efficacy of the Greek fire. 16 The important secret of
      compounding and directing this artificial flame was imparted by
      Callinicus, a native of Heliopolis in Syria, who deserted from
      the service of the caliph to that of the emperor. 17 The skill of
      a chemist and engineer was equivalent to the succor of fleets and
      armies; and this discovery or improvement of the military art was
      fortunately reserved for the distressful period, when the
      degenerate Romans of the East were incapable of contending with
      the warlike enthusiasm and youthful vigor of the Saracens. The
      historian who presumes to analyze this extraordinary composition
      should suspect his own ignorance and that of his Byzantine
      guides, so prone to the marvellous, so careless, and, in this
      instance, so jealous of the truth. From their obscure, and
      perhaps fallacious, hints it should seem that the principal
      ingredient of the Greek fire was the naphtha, 18 or liquid
      bitumen, a light, tenacious, and inflammable oil, 19 which
      springs from the earth, and catches fire as soon as it comes in
      contact with the air. The naphtha was mingled, I know not by what
      methods or in what proportions, with sulphur and with the pitch
      that is extracted from evergreen firs. 20 From this mixture,
      which produced a thick smoke and a loud explosion, proceeded a
      fierce and obstinate flame, which not only rose in perpendicular
      ascent, but likewise burnt with equal vehemence in descent or
      lateral progress; instead of being extinguished, it was nourished
      and quickened by the element of water; and sand, urine, or
      vinegar, were the only remedies that could damp the fury of this
      powerful agent, which was justly denominated by the Greeks the
      liquid, or the maritime, fire. For the annoyance of the enemy, it
      was employed with equal effect, by sea and land, in battles or in
      sieges. It was either poured from the rampart in large boilers,
      or launched in red-hot balls of stone and iron, or darted in
      arrows and javelins, twisted round with flax and tow, which had
      deeply imbibed the inflammable oil; sometimes it was deposited in
      fire-ships, the victims and instruments of a more ample revenge,
      and was most commonly blown through long tubes of copper which
      were planted on the prow of a galley, and fancifully shaped into
      the mouths of savage monsters, that seemed to vomit a stream of
      liquid and consuming fire. This important art was preserved at
      Constantinople, as the palladium of the state: the galleys and
      artillery might occasionally be lent to the allies of Rome; but
      the composition of the Greek fire was concealed with the most
      jealous scruple, and the terror of the enemies was increased and
      prolonged by their ignorance and surprise. In the treaties of the
      administration of the empire, the royal author 21 suggests the
      answers and excuses that might best elude the indiscreet
      curiosity and importunate demands of the Barbarians. They should
      be told that the mystery of the Greek fire had been revealed by
      an angel to the first and greatest of the Constantines, with a
      sacred injunction, that this gift of Heaven, this peculiar
      blessing of the Romans, should never be communicated to any
      foreign nation; that the prince and the subject were alike bound
      to religious silence under the temporal and spiritual penalties
      of treason and sacrilege; and that the impious attempt would
      provoke the sudden and supernatural vengeance of the God of the
      Christians. By these precautions, the secret was confined, above
      four hundred years, to the Romans of the East; and at the end of
      the eleventh century, the Pisans, to whom every sea and every art
      were familiar, suffered the effects, without understanding the
      composition, of the Greek fire. It was at length either
      discovered or stolen by the Mahometans; and, in the holy wars of
      Syria and Egypt, they retorted an invention, contrived against
      themselves, on the heads of the Christians. A knight, who
      despised the swords and lances of the Saracens, relates, with
      heartfelt sincerity, his own fears, and those of his companions,
      at the sight and sound of the mischievous engine that discharged
      a torrent of the Greek fire, the feu Gregeois, as it is styled by
      the more early of the French writers. It came flying through the
      air, says Joinville, 22 like a winged long-tailed dragon, about
      the thickness of a hogshead, with the report of thunder and the
      velocity of lightning; and the darkness of the night was
      dispelled by this deadly illumination. The use of the Greek, or,
      as it might now be called, of the Saracen fire, was continued to
      the middle of the fourteenth century, 23 when the scientific or
      casual compound of nitre, sulphur, and charcoal, effected a new
      revolution in the art of war and the history of mankind. 24

      Chapter LII: More Conquests By The Arabs.—Part II.

      Constantinople and the Greek fire might exclude the Arabs from
      the eastern entrance of Europe; but in the West, on the side of
      the Pyrenees, the provinces of Gaul were threatened and invaded
      by the conquerors of Spain. 25 The decline of the French monarchy
      invited the attack of these insatiate fanatics. The descendants
      of Clovis had lost the inheritance of his martial and ferocious
      spirit; and their misfortune or demerit has affixed the epithet
      of lazy to the last kings of the Merovingian race. 26 They
      ascended the throne without power, and sunk into the grave
      without a name. A country palace, in the neighborhood of
      Compiegne 27 was allotted for their residence or prison: but each
      year, in the month of March or May, they were conducted in a
      wagon drawn by oxen to the assembly of the Franks, to give
      audience to foreign ambassadors, and to ratify the acts of the
      mayor of the palace. That domestic officer was become the
      minister of the nation and the master of the prince. A public
      employment was converted into the patrimony of a private family:
      the elder Pepin left a king of mature years under the
      guardianship of his own widow and her child; and these feeble
      regents were forcibly dispossessed by the most active of his
      bastards. A government, half savage and half corrupt, was almost
      dissolved; and the tributary dukes, and provincial counts, and
      the territorial lords, were tempted to despise the weakness of
      the monarch, and to imitate the ambition of the mayor. Among
      these independent chiefs, one of the boldest and most successful
      was Eudes, duke of Aquitain, who in the southern provinces of
      Gaul usurped the authority, and even the title of king. The
      Goths, the Gascons, and the Franks, assembled under the standard
      of this Christian hero: he repelled the first invasion of the
      Saracens; and Zama, lieutenant of the caliph, lost his army and
      his life under the walls of Thoulouse. The ambition of his
      successors was stimulated by revenge; they repassed the Pyrenees
      with the means and the resolution of conquest. The advantageous
      situation which had recommended Narbonne 28 as the first Roman
      colony, was again chosen by the Moslems: they claimed the
      province of Septimania or Languedoc as a just dependence of the
      Spanish monarchy: the vineyards of Gascony and the city of
      Bourdeaux were possessed by the sovereign of Damascus and
      Samarcand; and the south of France, from the mouth of the Garonne
      to that of the Rhone, assumed the manners and religion of Arabia.

      and one of the most northern places of the known world,
      (D’Anville, Notice de l’Ancienne Gaule, p. 473.)]

      But these narrow limits were scorned by the spirit of Abdalraman,
      or Abderame, who had been restored by the caliph Hashem to the
      wishes of the soldiers and people of Spain. That veteran and
      daring commander adjudged to the obedience of the prophet
      whatever yet remained of France or of Europe; and prepared to
      execute the sentence, at the head of a formidable host, in the
      full confidence of surmounting all opposition either of nature or
      of man. His first care was to suppress a domestic rebel, who
      commanded the most important passes of the Pyrenees: Manuza, a
      Moorish chief, had accepted the alliance of the duke of Aquitain;
      and Eudes, from a motive of private or public interest, devoted
      his beauteous daughter to the embraces of the African
      misbeliever. But the strongest fortresses of Cerdagne were
      invested by a superior force; the rebel was overtaken and slain
      in the mountains; and his widow was sent a captive to Damascus,
      to gratify the desires, or more probably the vanity, of the
      commander of the faithful. From the Pyrenees, Abderame proceeded
      without delay to the passage of the Rhone and the siege of Arles.

      An army of Christians attempted the relief of the city: the tombs
      of their leaders were yet visible in the thirteenth century; and
      many thousands of their dead bodies were carried down the rapid
      stream into the Mediterranean Sea. The arms of Abderame were not
      less successful on the side of the ocean. He passed without
      opposition the Garonne and Dordogne, which unite their waters in
      the Gulf of Bourdeaux; but he found, beyond those rivers, the
      camp of the intrepid Eudes, who had formed a second army and
      sustained a second defeat, so fatal to the Christians, that,
      according to their sad confession, God alone could reckon the
      number of the slain. The victorious Saracen overran the provinces
      of Aquitain, whose Gallic names are disguised, rather than lost,
      in the modern appellations of Perigord, Saintonge, and Poitou:
      his standards were planted on the walls, or at least before the
      gates, of Tours and of Sens; and his detachments overspread the
      kingdom of Burgundy as far as the well-known cities of Lyons and
      Besançon. The memory of these devastations (for Abderame did not
      spare the country or the people) was long preserved by tradition;
      and the invasion of France by the Moors or Mahometans affords the
      groundwork of those fables, which have been so wildly disfigured
      in the romances of chivalry, and so elegantly adorned by the
      Italian muse. In the decline of society and art, the deserted
      cities could supply a slender booty to the Saracens; their
      richest spoil was found in the churches and monasteries, which
      they stripped of their ornaments and delivered to the flames: and
      the tutelar saints, both Hilary of Poitiers and Martin of Tours,
      forgot their miraculous powers in the defence of their own
      sepulchres. 29 A victorious line of march had been prolonged
      above a thousand miles from the rock of Gibraltar to the banks of
      the Loire; the repetition of an equal space would have carried
      the Saracens to the confines of Poland and the Highlands of
      Scotland; the Rhine is not more impassable than the Nile or
      Euphrates, and the Arabian fleet might have sailed without a
      naval combat into the mouth of the Thames. Perhaps the
      interpretation of the Koran would now be taught in the schools of
      Oxford, and her pulpits might demonstrate to a circumcised people
      the sanctity and truth of the revelation of Mahomet. 30

      character and religion of Mahomet are always adapted to his
      argument, and generally founded in truth and reason. He sustains
      the part of a lively and eloquent advocate; and sometimes rises
      to the merit of an historian and philosopher.]

      From such calamities was Christendom delivered by the genius and
      fortune of one man. Charles, the illegitimate son of the elder
      Pepin, was content with the titles of mayor or duke of the
      Franks; but he deserved to become the father of a line of kings.
      In a laborious administration of twenty-four years, he restored
      and supported the dignity of the throne, and the rebels of
      Germany and Gaul were successively crushed by the activity of a
      warrior, who, in the same campaign, could display his banner on
      the Elbe, the Rhone, and the shores of the ocean. In the public
      danger he was summoned by the voice of his country; and his
      rival, the duke of Aquitain, was reduced to appear among the
      fugitives and suppliants. “Alas!” exclaimed the Franks, “what a
      misfortune! what an indignity! We have long heard of the name and
      conquests of the Arabs: we were apprehensive of their attack from
      the East; they have now conquered Spain, and invade our country
      on the side of the West. Yet their numbers, and (since they have
      no buckler) their arms, are inferior to our own.” “If you follow
      my advice,” replied the prudent mayor of the palace, “you will
      not interrupt their march, nor precipitate your attack. They are
      like a torrent, which it is dangerous to stem in its career. The
      thirst of riches, and the consciousness of success, redouble
      their valor, and valor is of more avail than arms or numbers. Be
      patient till they have loaded themselves with the encumbrance of
      wealth. The possession of wealth will divide their councils and
      assure your victory.” This subtile policy is perhaps a refinement
      of the Arabian writers; and the situation of Charles will suggest
      a more narrow and selfish motive of procrastination—the secret
      desire of humbling the pride and wasting the provinces of the
      rebel duke of Aquitain. It is yet more probable, that the delays
      of Charles were inevitable and reluctant. A standing army was
      unknown under the first and second race; more than half the
      kingdom was now in the hands of the Saracens: according to their
      respective situation, the Franks of Neustria and Austrasia were
      to conscious or too careless of the impending danger; and the
      voluntary aids of the Gepidae and Germans were separated by a
      long interval from the standard of the Christian general. No
      sooner had he collected his forces, than he sought and found the
      enemy in the centre of France, between Tours and Poitiers. His
      well-conducted march was covered with a range of hills, and
      Abderame appears to have been surprised by his unexpected
      presence. The nations of Asia, Africa, and Europe, advanced with
      equal ardor to an encounter which would change the history of the
      world. In the six first days of desultory combat, the horsemen
      and archers of the East maintained their advantage: but in the
      closer onset of the seventh day, the Orientals were oppressed by
      the strength and stature of the Germans, who, with stout hearts
      and iron hands, 31 asserted the civil and religious freedom of
      their posterity. The epithet of Martel, the Hammer, which has
      been added to the name of Charles, is expressive of his weighty
      and irresistible strokes: the valor of Eudes was excited by
      resentment and emulation; and their companions, in the eye of
      history, are the true Peers and Paladins of French chivalry.
      After a bloody field, in which Abderame was slain, the Saracens,
      in the close of the evening, retired to their camp. In the
      disorder and despair of the night, the various tribes of Yemen
      and Damascus, of Africa and Spain, were provoked to turn their
      arms against each other: the remains of their host were suddenly
      dissolved, and each emir consulted his safety by a hasty and
      separate retreat. At the dawn of the day, the stillness of a
      hostile camp was suspected by the victorious Christians: on the
      report of their spies, they ventured to explore the riches of the
      vacant tents; but if we except some celebrated relics, a small
      portion of the spoil was restored to the innocent and lawful
      owners. The joyful tidings were soon diffused over the Catholic
      world, and the monks of Italy could affirm and believe that three
      hundred and fifty, or three hundred and seventy-five, thousand of
      the Mahometans had been crushed by the hammer of Charles, 32
      while no more than fifteen hundred Christians were slain in the
      field of Tours. But this incredible tale is sufficiently
      disproved by the caution of the French general, who apprehended
      the snares and accidents of a pursuit, and dismissed his German
      allies to their native forests.

      The inactivity of a conqueror betrays the loss of strength and
      blood, and the most cruel execution is inflicted, not in the
      ranks of battle, but on the backs of a flying enemy. Yet the
      victory of the Franks was complete and final; Aquitain was
      recovered by the arms of Eudes; the Arabs never resumed the
      conquest of Gaul, and they were soon driven beyond the Pyrenees
      by Charles Martel and his valiant race. 33 It might have been
      expected that the savior of Christendom would have been
      canonized, or at least applauded, by the gratitude of the clergy,
      who are indebted to his sword for their present existence. But in
      the public distress, the mayor of the palace had been compelled
      to apply the riches, or at least the revenues, of the bishops and
      abbots, to the relief of the state and the reward of the
      soldiers. His merits were forgotten, his sacrilege alone was
      remembered, and, in an epistle to a Carlovingian prince, a Gallic
      synod presumes to declare that his ancestor was damned; that on
      the opening of his tomb, the spectators were affrighted by a
      smell of fire and the aspect of a horrid dragon; and that a saint
      of the times was indulged with a pleasant vision of the soul and
      body of Charles Martel, burning, to all eternity, in the abyss of
      hell. 34

      The loss of an army, or a province, in the Western world, was
      less painful to the court of Damascus, than the rise and progress
      of a domestic competitor. Except among the Syrians, the caliphs
      of the house of Ommiyah had never been the objects of the public
      favor. The life of Mahomet recorded their perseverance in
      idolatry and rebellion: their conversion had been reluctant,
      their elevation irregular and factious, and their throne was
      cemented with the most holy and noble blood of Arabia. The best
      of their race, the pious Omar, was dissatisfied with his own
      title: their personal virtues were insufficient to justify a
      departure from the order of succession; and the eyes and wishes
      of the faithful were turned towards the line of Hashem, and the
      kindred of the apostle of God. Of these the Fatimites were either
      rash or pusillanimous; but the descendants of Abbas cherished,
      with courage and discretion, the hopes of their rising fortunes.
      From an obscure residence in Syria, they secretly despatched
      their agents and missionaries, who preached in the Eastern
      provinces their hereditary indefeasible right; and Mohammed, the
      son of Ali, the son of Abdallah, the son of Abbas, the uncle of
      the prophet, gave audience to the deputies of Chorasan, and
      accepted their free gift of four hundred thousand pieces of gold.
      After the death of Mohammed, the oath of allegiance was
      administered in the name of his son Ibrahim to a numerous band of
      votaries, who expected only a signal and a leader; and the
      governor of Chorasan continued to deplore his fruitless
      admonitions and the deadly slumber of the caliphs of Damascus,
      till he himself, with all his adherents, was driven from the city
      and palace of Meru, by the rebellious arms of Abu Moslem. 35 That
      maker of kings, the author, as he is named, of the call of the
      Abbassides, was at length rewarded for his presumption of merit
      with the usual gratitude of courts. A mean, perhaps a foreign,
      extraction could not repress the aspiring energy of Abu Moslem.
      Jealous of his wives, liberal of his wealth, prodigal of his own
      blood and of that of others, he could boast with pleasure, and
      possibly with truth, that he had destroyed six hundred thousand
      of his enemies; and such was the intrepid gravity of his mind and
      countenance, that he was never seen to smile except on a day of
      battle. In the visible separation of parties, the green was
      consecrated to the Fatimites; the Ommiades were distinguished by
      the white; and the black, as the most adverse, was naturally
      adopted by the Abbassides. Their turbans and garments were
      stained with that gloomy color: two black standards, on pike
      staves nine cubits long, were borne aloft in the van of Abu
      Moslem; and their allegorical names of the night and the shadow
      obscurely represented the indissoluble union and perpetual
      succession of the line of Hashem. From the Indus to the
      Euphrates, the East was convulsed by the quarrel of the white and
      the black factions: the Abbassides were most frequently
      victorious; but their public success was clouded by the personal
      misfortune of their chief. The court of Damascus, awakening from
      a long slumber, resolved to prevent the pilgrimage of Mecca,
      which Ibrahim had undertaken with a splendid retinue, to
      recommend himself at once to the favor of the prophet and of the
      people. A detachment of cavalry intercepted his march and
      arrested his person; and the unhappy Ibrahim, snatched away from
      the promise of untasted royalty, expired in iron fetters in the
      dungeons of Haran. His two younger brothers, Saffah 3511 and
      Almansor, eluded the search of the tyrant, and lay concealed at
      Cufa, till the zeal of the people and the approach of his Eastern
      friends allowed them to expose their persons to the impatient
      public. On Friday, in the dress of a caliph, in the colors of the
      sect, Saffah proceeded with religious and military pomp to the
      mosch: ascending the pulpit, he prayed and preached as the lawful
      successor of Mahomet; and after his departure, his kinsmen bound
      a willing people by an oath of fidelity. But it was on the banks
      of the Zab, and not in the mosch of Cufa, that this important
      controversy was determined. Every advantage appeared to be on the
      side of the white faction: the authority of established
      government; an army of a hundred and twenty thousand soldiers,
      against a sixth part of that number; and the presence and merit
      of the caliph Mervan, the fourteenth and last of the house of
      Ommiyah. Before his accession to the throne, he had deserved, by
      his Georgian warfare, the honorable epithet of the ass of
      Mesopotamia; 36 and he might have been ranked amongst the
      greatest princes, had not, says Abulfeda, the eternal order
      decreed that moment for the ruin of his family; a decree against
      which all human fortitude and prudence must struggle in vain. The
      orders of Mervan were mistaken, or disobeyed: the return of his
      horse, from which he had dismounted on a necessary occasion,
      impressed the belief of his death; and the enthusiasm of the
      black squadrons was ably conducted by Abdallah, the uncle of his
      competitor. After an irretrievab defeat, the caliph escaped to
      Mosul; but the colors of the Abbassides were displayed from the
      rampart; he suddenly repassed the Tigris, cast a melancholy look
      on his palace of Haran, crossed the Euphrates, abandoned the
      fortifications of Damascus, and, without halting in Palestine,
      pitched his last and fatal camp at Busir, on the banks of the
      Nile. 37 His speed was urged by the incessant diligence of
      Abdallah, who in every step of the pursuit acquired strength and
      reputation: the remains of the white faction were finally
      vanquished in Egypt; and the lance, which terminated the life and
      anxiety of Mervan, was not less welcome perhaps to the
      unfortunate than to the victorious chief. The merciless
      inquisition of the conqueror eradicated the most distant branches
      of the hostile race: their bones were scattered, their memory was
      accursed, and the martyrdom of Hossein was abundantly revenged on
      the posterity of his tyrants. Fourscore of the Ommiades, who had
      yielded to the faith or clemency of their foes, were invited to a
      banquet at Damascus. The laws of hospitality were violated by a
      promiscuous massacre: the board was spread over their fallen
      bodies; and the festivity of the guests was enlivened by the
      music of their dying groans. By the event of the civil war, the
      dynasty of the Abbassides was firmly established; but the
      Christians only could triumph in the mutual hatred and common
      loss of the disciples of Mahomet. 38

      Yet the thousands who were swept away by the sword of war might
      have been speedily retrieved in the succeeding generation, if the
      consequences of the revolution had not tended to dissolve the
      power and unity of the empire of the Saracens. In the
      proscription of the Ommiades, a royal youth of the name of
      Abdalrahman alone escaped the rage of his enemies, who hunted the
      wandering exile from the banks of the Euphrates to the valleys of
      Mount Atlas. His presence in the neighborhood of Spain revived
      the zeal of the white faction. The name and cause of the
      Abbassides had been first vindicated by the Persians: the West
      had been pure from civil arms; and the servants of the abdicated
      family still held, by a precarious tenure, the inheritance of
      their lands and the offices of government. Strongly prompted by
      gratitude, indignation, and fear, they invited the grandson of
      the caliph Hashem to ascend the throne of his ancestors; and, in
      his desperate condition, the extremes of rashness and prudence
      were almost the same. The acclamations of the people saluted his
      landing on the coast of Andalusia: and, after a successful
      struggle, Abdalrahman established the throne of Cordova, and was
      the father of the Ommiades of Spain, who reigned above two
      hundred and fifty years from the Atlantic to the Pyrenees. 39 He
      slew in battle a lieutenant of the Abbassides, who had invaded
      his dominions with a fleet and army: the head of Ala, in salt and
      camphire, was suspended by a daring messenger before the palace
      of Mecca; and the caliph Almansor rejoiced in his safety, that he
      was removed by seas and lands from such a formidable adversary.
      Their mutual designs or declarations of offensive war evaporated
      without effect; but instead of opening a door to the conquest of
      Europe, Spain was dissevered from the trunk of the monarchy,
      engaged in perpetual hostility with the East, and inclined to
      peace and friendship with the Christian sovereigns of
      Constantinople and France. The example of the Ommiades was
      imitated by the real or fictitious progeny of Ali, the Edrissites
      of Mauritania, and the more powerful fatimites of Africa and
      Egypt. In the tenth century, the chair of Mahomet was disputed by
      three caliphs or commanders of the faithful, who reigned at
      Bagdad, Cairoan, and Cordova, excommunicating each other, and
      agreed only in a principle of discord, that a sectary is more
      odious and criminal than an unbeliever. 40

      want of knowledge or reflection; but Sir William was deceived by
      a Spanish impostor, who has framed an apocryphal history of the
      conquest of Spain by the Arabs.]

      Mecca was the patrimony of the line of Hashem, yet the Abbassides
      were never tempted to reside either in the birthplace or the city
      of the prophet. Damascus was disgraced by the choice, and
      polluted with the blood, of the Ommiades; and, after some
      hesitation, Almansor, the brother and successor of Saffah, laid
      the foundations of Bagdad, 41 the Imperial seat of his posterity
      during a reign of five hundred years. 42 The chosen spot is on
      the eastern bank of the Tigris, about fifteen miles above the
      ruins of Modain: the double wall was of a circular form; and such
      was the rapid increase of a capital, now dwindled to a provincial
      town, that the funeral of a popular saint might be attended by
      eight hundred thousand men and sixty thousand women of Bagdad and
      the adjacent villages. In this city of peace, 43 amidst the
      riches of the East, the Abbassides soon disdained the abstinence
      and frugality of the first caliphs, and aspired to emulate the
      magnificence of the Persian kings. After his wars and buildings,
      Almansor left behind him in gold and silver about thirty millions
      sterling: 44 and this treasure was exhausted in a few years by
      the vices or virtues of his children. His son Mahadi, in a single
      pilgrimage to Mecca, expended six millions of dinars of gold. A
      pious and charitable motive may sanctify the foundation of
      cisterns and caravanseras, which he distributed along a measured
      road of seven hundred miles; but his train of camels, laden with
      snow, could serve only to astonish the natives of Arabia, and to
      refresh the fruits and liquors of the royal banquet. 45 The
      courtiers would surely praise the liberality of his grandson
      Almamon, who gave away four fifths of the income of a province, a
      sum of two millions four hundred thousand gold dinars, before he
      drew his foot from the stirrup. At the nuptials of the same
      prince, a thousand pearls of the largest size were showered on
      the head of the bride, 46 and a lottery of lands and houses
      displayed the capricious bounty of fortune. The glories of the
      court were brightened, rather than impaired, in the decline of
      the empire, and a Greek ambassador might admire, or pity, the
      magnificence of the feeble Moctader. “The caliph’s whole army,”
      says the historian Abulfeda, “both horse and foot, was under
      arms, which together made a body of one hundred and sixty
      thousand men. His state officers, the favorite slaves, stood near
      him in splendid apparel, their belts glittering with gold and
      gems. Near them were seven thousand eunuchs, four thousand of
      them white, the remainder black. The porters or door-keepers were
      in number seven hundred. Barges and boats, with the most superb
      decorations, were seen swimming upon the Tigris. Nor was the
      palace itself less splendid, in which were hung up thirty-eight
      thousand pieces of tapestry, twelve thousand five hundred of
      which were of silk embroidered with gold. The carpets on the
      floor were twenty-two thousand. A hundred lions were brought out,
      with a keeper to each lion. 47 Among the other spectacles of rare
      and stupendous luxury was a tree of gold and silver spreading
      into eighteen large branches, on which, and on the lesser boughs,
      sat a variety of birds made of the same precious metals, as well
      as the leaves of the tree. While the machinery affected
      spontaneous motions, the several birds warbled their natural
      harmony. Through this scene of magnificence, the Greek ambassador
      was led by the vizier to the foot of the caliph’s throne.” 48 In
      the West, the Ommiades of Spain supported, with equal pomp, the
      title of commander of the faithful. Three miles from Cordova, in
      honor of his favorite sultana, the third and greatest of the
      Abdalrahmans constructed the city, palace, and gardens of Zehra.
      Twenty-five years, and above three millions sterling, were
      employed by the founder: his liberal taste invited the artists of
      Constantinople, the most skilful sculptors and architects of the
      age; and the buildings were sustained or adorned by twelve
      hundred columns of Spanish and African, of Greek and Italian
      marble. The hall of audience was incrusted with gold and pearls,
      and a great basin in the centre was surrounded with the curious
      and costly figures of birds and quadrupeds. In a lofty pavilion
      of the gardens, one of these basins and fountains, so delightful
      in a sultry climate, was replenished not with water, but with the
      purest quicksilver. The seraglio of Abdalrahman, his wives,
      concubines, and black eunuchs, amounted to six thousand three
      hundred persons: and he was attended to the field by a guard of
      twelve thousand horse, whose belts and cimeters were studded with
      gold. 49

      poverty and subordination; but the lives and labors of millions
      are devoted to the service of a despotic prince, whose laws are
      blindly obeyed, and whose wishes are instantly gratified. Our
      imagination is dazzled by the splendid picture; and whatever may
      be the cool dictates of reason, there are few among us who would
      obstinately refuse a trial of the comforts and the cares of
      royalty. It may therefore be of some use to borrow the experience
      of the same Abdalrahman, whose magnificence has perhaps excited
      our admiration and envy, and to transcribe an authentic memorial
      which was found in the closet of the deceased caliph. “I have now
      reigned above fifty years in victory or peace; beloved by my
      subjects, dreaded by my enemies, and respected by my allies.
      Riches and honors, power and pleasure, have waited on my call,
      nor does any earthly blessing appear to have been wanting to my
      felicity. In this situation, I have diligently numbered the days
      of pure and genuine happiness which have fallen to my lot: they
      amount to Fourteen:—O man! place not thy confidence in this
      present world!” 50 The luxury of the caliphs, so useless to their
      private happiness, relaxed the nerves, and terminated the
      progress, of the Arabian empire. Temporal and spiritual conquest
      had been the sole occupation of the first successors of Mahomet;
      and after supplying themselves with the necessaries of life, the
      whole revenue was scrupulously devoted to that salutary work. The
      Abbassides were impoverished by the multitude of their wants, and
      their contempt of oeconomy. Instead of pursuing the great object
      of ambition, their leisure, their affections, the powers of their
      mind, were diverted by pomp and pleasure: the rewards of valor
      were embezzled by women and eunuchs, and the royal camp was
      encumbered by the luxury of the palace. A similar temper was
      diffused among the subjects of the caliph. Their stern enthusiasm
      was softened by time and prosperity. they sought riches in the
      occupations of industry, fame in the pursuits of literature, and
      happiness in the tranquillity of domestic life. War was no longer
      the passion of the Saracens; and the increase of pay, the
      repetition of donatives, were insufficient to allure the
      posterity of those voluntary champions who had crowded to the
      standard of Abubeker and Omar for the hopes of spoil and of
      paradise.

      of myself, (the only person of whom I can speak with certainty,)
      my happy hours have far exceeded, and far exceed, the scanty
      numbers of the caliph of Spain; and I shall not scruple to add,
      that many of them are due to the pleasing labor of the present
      composition.]

      Under the reign of the Ommiades, the studies of the Moslems were
      confined to the interpretation of the Koran, and the eloquence
      and poetry of their native tongue. A people continually exposed
      to the dangers of the field must esteem the healing powers of
      medicine, or rather of surgery; but the starving physicians of
      Arabia murmured a complaint that exercise and temperance deprived
      them of the greatest part of their practice. 51 After their civil
      and domestic wars, the subjects of the Abbassides, awakening from
      this mental lethargy, found leisure and felt curiosity for the
      acquisition of profane science. This spirit was first encouraged
      by the caliph Almansor, who, besides his knowledge of the
      Mahometan law, had applied himself with success to the study of
      astronomy. But when the sceptre devolved to Almamon, the seventh
      of the Abbassides, he completed the designs of his grandfather,
      and invited the muses from their ancient seats. His ambassadors
      at Constantinople, his agents in Armenia, Syria, and Egypt,
      collected the volumes of Grecian science; at his command they
      were translated by the most skilful interpreters into the Arabic
      language: his subjects were exhorted assiduously to peruse these
      instructive writings; and the successor of Mahomet assisted with
      pleasure and modesty at the assemblies and disputations of the
      learned. “He was not ignorant,” says Abulpharagius, “that they
      are the elect of God, his best and most useful servants, whose
      lives are devoted to the improvement of their rational faculties.
      The mean ambition of the Chinese or the Turks may glory in the
      industry of their hands or the indulgence of their brutal
      appetites. Yet these dexterous artists must view, with hopeless
      emulation, the hexagons and pyramids of the cells of a beehive:
      52 these fortitudinous heroes are awed by the superior fierceness
      of the lions and tigers; and in their amorous enjoyments they are
      much inferior to the vigor of the grossest and most sordid
      quadrupeds. The teachers of wisdom are the true luminaries and
      legislators of a world, which, without their aid, would again
      sink in ignorance and barbarism.” 53 The zeal and curiosity of
      Almamon were imitated by succeeding princes of the line of Abbas:
      their rivals, the Fatimites of Africa and the Ommiades of Spain,
      were the patrons of the learned, as well as the commanders of the
      faithful; the same royal prerogative was claimed by their
      independent emirs of the provinces; and their emulation diffused
      the taste and the rewards of science from Samarcand and Bochara
      to Fez and Cordova. The vizier of a sultan consecrated a sum of
      two hundred thousand pieces of gold to the foundation of a
      college at Bagdad, which he endowed with an annual revenue of
      fifteen thousand dinars. The fruits of instruction were
      communicated, perhaps at different times, to six thousand
      disciples of every degree, from the son of the noble to that of
      the mechanic: a sufficient allowance was provided for the
      indigent scholars; and the merit or industry of the professors
      was repaid with adequate stipends. In every city the productions
      of Arabic literature were copied and collected by the curiosity
      of the studious and the vanity of the rich. A private doctor
      refused the invitation of the sultan of Bochara, because the
      carriage of his books would have required four hundred camels.
      The royal library of the Fatimites consisted of one hundred
      thousand manuscripts, elegantly transcribed and splendidly bound,
      which were lent, without jealousy or avarice, to the students of
      Cairo. Yet this collection must appear moderate, if we can
      believe that the Ommiades of Spain had formed a library of six
      hundred thousand volumes, forty-four of which were employed in
      the mere catalogue. Their capital, Cordova, with the adjacent
      towns of Malaga, Almeria, and Murcia, had given birth to more
      than three hundred writers, and above seventy public libraries
      were opened in the cities of the Andalusian kingdom. The age of
      Arabian learning continued about five hundred years, till the
      great eruption of the Moguls, and was coeval with the darkest and
      most slothful period of European annals; but since the sun of
      science has arisen in the West, it should seem that the Oriental
      studies have languished and declined. 54

      In the libraries of the Arabians, as in those of Europe, the far
      greater part of the innumerable volumes were possessed only of
      local value or imaginary merit. 55 The shelves were crowded with
      orators and poets, whose style was adapted to the taste and
      manners of their countrymen; with general and partial histories,
      which each revolving generation supplied with a new harvest of
      persons and events; with codes and commentaries of jurisprudence,
      which derived their authority from the law of the prophet; with
      the interpreters of the Koran, and orthodox tradition; and with
      the whole theological tribe, polemics, mystics, scholastics, and
      moralists, the first or the last of writers, according to the
      different estimates of sceptics or believers. The works of
      speculation or science may be reduced to the four classes of
      philosophy, mathematics, astronomy, and physic. The sages of
      Greece were translated and illustrated in the Arabic language,
      and some treatises, now lost in the original, have been recovered
      in the versions of the East, 56 which possessed and studied the
      writings of Aristotle and Plato, of Euclid and Apollonius, of
      Ptolemy, Hippocrates, and Galen. 57 Among the ideal systems which
      have varied with the fashion of the times, the Arabians adopted
      the philosophy of the Stagirite, alike intelligible or alike
      obscure for the readers of every age. Plato wrote for the
      Athenians, and his allegorical genius is too closely blended with
      the language and religion of Greece. After the fall of that
      religion, the Peripatetics, emerging from their obscurity,
      prevailed in the controversies of the Oriental sects, and their
      founder was long afterwards restored by the Mahometans of Spain
      to the Latin schools. 58 The physics, both of the Academy and the
      Lycaeum, as they are built, not on observation, but on argument,
      have retarded the progress of real knowledge. The metaphysics of
      infinite, or finite, spirit, have too often been enlisted in the
      service of superstition. But the human faculties are fortified by
      the art and practice of dialectics; the ten predicaments of
      Aristotle collect and methodize our ideas, 59 and his syllogism
      is the keenest weapon of dispute. It was dexterously wielded in
      the schools of the Saracens, but as it is more effectual for the
      detection of error than for the investigation of truth, it is not
      surprising that new generations of masters and disciples should
      still revolve in the same circle of logical argument. The
      mathematics are distinguished by a peculiar privilege, that, in
      the course of ages, they may always advance, and can never
      recede. But the ancient geometry, if I am not misinformed, was
      resumed in the same state by the Italians of the fifteenth
      century; and whatever may be the origin of the name, the science
      of algebra is ascribed to the Grecian Diophantus by the modest
      testimony of the Arabs themselves. 60 They cultivated with more
      success the sublime science of astronomy, which elevates the mind
      of man to disdain his diminutive planet and momentary existence.
      The costly instruments of observation were supplied by the caliph
      Almamon, and the land of the Chaldaeans still afforded the same
      spacious level, the same unclouded horizon. In the plains of
      Sinaar, and a second time in those of Cufa, his mathematicians
      accurately measured a degree of the great circle of the earth,
      and determined at twenty-four thousand miles the entire
      circumference of our globe. 61 From the reign of the Abbassides
      to that of the grandchildren of Tamerlane, the stars, without the
      aid of glasses, were diligently observed; and the astronomical
      tables of Bagdad, Spain, and Samarcand, 62 correct some minute
      errors, without daring to renounce the hypothesis of Ptolemy,
      without advancing a step towards the discovery of the solar
      system. In the Eastern courts, the truths of science could be
      recommended only by ignorance and folly, and the astronomer would
      have been disregarded, had he not debased his wisdom or honesty
      by the vain predictions of astrology. 63 But in the science of
      medicine, the Arabians have been deservedly applauded. The names
      of Mesua and Geber, of Razis and Avicenna, are ranked with the
      Grecian masters; in the city of Bagdad, eight hundred and sixty
      physicians were licensed to exercise their lucrative profession:
      64 in Spain, the life of the Catholic princes was intrusted to
      the skill of the Saracens, 65 and the school of Salerno, their
      legitimate offspring, revived in Italy and Europe the precepts of
      the healing art. 66 The success of each professor must have been
      influenced by personal and accidental causes; but we may form a
      less fanciful estimate of their general knowledge of anatomy, 67
      botany, 68 and chemistry, 69 the threefold basis of their theory
      and practice. A superstitious reverence for the dead confined
      both the Greeks and the Arabians to the dissection of apes and
      quadrupeds; the more solid and visible parts were known in the
      time of Galen, and the finer scrutiny of the human frame was
      reserved for the microscope and the injections of modern artists.
      Botany is an active science, and the discoveries of the torrid
      zone might enrich the herbal of Dioscorides with two thousand
      plants. Some traditionary knowledge might be secreted in the
      temples and monasteries of Egypt; much useful experience had been
      acquired in the practice of arts and manufactures; but the
      science of chemistry owes its origin and improvement to the
      industry of the Saracens. They first invented and named the
      alembic for the purposes of distillation, analyzed the substances
      of the three kingdoms of nature, tried the distinction and
      affinities of alcalis and acids, and converted the poisonous
      minerals into soft and salutary medicines. But the most eager
      search of Arabian chemistry was the transmutation of metals, and
      the elixir of immortal health: the reason and the fortunes of
      thousands were evaporated in the crucibles of alchemy, and the
      consummation of the great work was promoted by the worthy aid of
      mystery, fable, and superstition.

      and realization of the notions of analysis and affinity were

      endeavor to show it remained for the chemists of Europe to make

      But the Moslems deprived themselves of the principal benefits of
      a familiar intercourse with Greece and Rome, the knowledge of
      antiquity, the purity of taste, and the freedom of thought.
      Confident in the riches of their native tongue, the Arabians
      disdained the study of any foreign idiom. The Greek interpreters
      were chosen among their Christian subjects; they formed their
      translations, sometimes on the original text, more frequently
      perhaps on a Syriac version; and in the crowd of astronomers and
      physicians, there is no example of a poet, an orator, or even an
      historian, being taught to speak the language of the Saracens. 70
      The mythology of Homer would have provoked the abhorrence of
      those stern fanatics: they possessed in lazy ignorance the
      colonies of the Macedonians, and the provinces of Carthage and
      Rome: the heroes of Plutarch and Livy were buried in oblivion;
      and the history of the world before Mahomet was reduced to a
      short legend of the patriarchs, the prophets, and the Persian
      kings. Our education in the Greek and Latin schools may have
      fixed in our minds a standard of exclusive taste; and I am not
      forward to condemn the literature and judgment of nations, of
      whose language I am ignorant. Yet I know that the classics have
      much to teach, and I believe that the Orientals have much to
      learn; the temperate dignity of style, the graceful proportions
      of art, the forms of visible and intellectual beauty, the just
      delineation of character and passion, the rhetoric of narrative
      and argument, the regular fabric of epic and dramatic poetry. 71
      The influence of truth and reason is of a less ambiguous
      complexion. The philosophers of Athens and Rome enjoyed the
      blessings, and asserted the rights, of civil and religious
      freedom. Their moral and political writings might have gradually
      unlocked the fetters of Eastern despotism, diffused a liberal
      spirit of inquiry and toleration, and encouraged the Arabian
      sages to suspect that their caliph was a tyrant, and their
      prophet an impostor. 72 The instinct of superstition was alarmed
      by the introduction even of the abstract sciences; and the more
      rigid doctors of the law condemned the rash and pernicious
      curiosity of Almamon. 73 To the thirst of martyrdom, the vision
      of paradise, and the belief of predestination, we must ascribe
      the invincible enthusiasm of the prince and people. And the sword
      of the Saracens became less formidable when their youth was drawn
      away from the camp to the college, when the armies of the
      faithful presumed to read and to reflect. Yet the foolish vanity
      of the Greeks was jealous of their studies, and reluctantly
      imparted the sacred fire to the Barbarians of the East. 74

      the same words by the continuator of Theophanes, (Scriptores post
      Theophanem, p. 118.)]

      In the bloody conflict of the Ommiades and Abbassides, the Greeks
      had stolen the opportunity of avenging their wrongs and enlarging
      their limits. But a severe retribution was exacted by Mohadi, the
      third caliph of the new dynasty, who seized, in his turn, the
      favorable opportunity, while a woman and a child, Irene and
      Constantine, were seated on the Byzantine throne. An army of
      ninety-five thousand Persians and Arabs was sent from the Tigris
      to the Thracian Bosphorus, under the command of Harun, 75 or
      Aaron, the second son of the commander of the faithful. His
      encampment on the opposite heights of Chrysopolis, or Scutari,
      informed Irene, in her palace of Constantinople, of the loss of
      her troops and provinces. With the consent or connivance of their
      sovereign, her ministers subscribed an ignominious peace; and the
      exchange of some royal gifts could not disguise the annual
      tribute of seventy thousand dinars of gold, which was imposed on
      the Roman empire. The Saracens had too rashly advanced into the
      midst of a distant and hostile land: their retreat was solicited
      by the promise of faithful guides and plentiful markets; and not
      a Greek had courage to whisper, that their weary forces might be
      surrounded and destroyed in their necessary passage between a
      slippery mountain and the River Sangarius. Five years after this
      expedition, Harun ascended the throne of his father and his elder
      brother; the most powerful and vigorous monarch of his race,
      illustrious in the West, as the ally of Charlemagne, and familiar
      to the most childish readers, as the perpetual hero of the
      Arabian tales. His title to the name of Al Rashid (the Just) is
      sullied by the extirpation of the generous, perhaps the innocent,
      Barmecides; yet he could listen to the complaint of a poor widow
      who had been pillaged by his troops, and who dared, in a passage
      of the Koran, to threaten the inattentive despot with the
      judgment of God and posterity. His court was adorned with luxury
      and science; but, in a reign of three-and-twenty years, Harun
      repeatedly visited his provinces from Chorasan to Egypt; nine
      times he performed the pilgrimage of Mecca; eight times he
      invaded the territories of the Romans; and as often as they
      declined the payment of the tribute, they were taught to feel
      that a month of depredation was more costly than a year of
      submission. But when the unnatural mother of Constantine was
      deposed and banished, her successor, Nicephorus, resolved to
      obliterate this badge of servitude and disgrace. The epistle of
      the emperor to the caliph was pointed with an allusion to the
      game of chess, which had already spread from Persia to Greece.
      “The queen (he spoke of Irene) considered you as a rook, and
      herself as a pawn. That pusillanimous female submitted to pay a
      tribute, the double of which she ought to have exacted from the
      Barbarians. Restore therefore the fruits of your injustice, or
      abide the determination of the sword.” At these words the
      ambassadors cast a bundle of swords before the foot of the
      throne. The caliph smiled at the menace, and drawing his cimeter,
      samsamah, a weapon of historic or fabulous renown, he cut asunder
      the feeble arms of the Greeks, without turning the edge, or
      endangering the temper, of his blade. He then dictated an epistle
      of tremendous brevity: “In the name of the most merciful God,
      Harun al Rashid, commander of the faithful, to Nicephorus, the
      Roman dog. I have read thy letter, O thou son of an unbelieving
      mother. Thou shalt not hear, thou shalt behold, my reply.” It was
      written in characters of blood and fire on the plains of Phrygia;
      and the warlike celerity of the Arabs could only be checked by
      the arts of deceit and the show of repentance.

      The triumphant caliph retired, after the fatigues of the
      campaign, to his favorite palace of Racca on the Euphrates: 76
      but the distance of five hundred miles, and the inclemency of the
      season, encouraged his adversary to violate the peace. Nicephorus
      was astonished by the bold and rapid march of the commander of
      the faithful, who repassed, in the depth of winter, the snows of
      Mount Taurus: his stratagems of policy and war were exhausted;
      and the perfidious Greek escaped with three wounds from a field
      of battle overspread with forty thousand of his subjects. Yet the
      emperor was ashamed of submission, and the caliph was resolved on
      victory. One hundred and thirty-five thousand regular soldiers
      received pay, and were inscribed in the military roll; and above
      three hundred thousand persons of every denomination marched
      under the black standard of the Abbassides. They swept the
      surface of Asia Minor far beyond Tyana and Ancyra, and invested
      the Pontic Heraclea, 77 once a flourishing state, now a paltry
      town; at that time capable of sustaining, in her antique walls, a
      month’s siege against the forces of the East. The ruin was
      complete, the spoil was ample; but if Harun had been conversant
      with Grecian story, he would have regretted the statue of
      Hercules, whose attributes, the club, the bow, the quiver, and
      the lion’s hide, were sculptured in massy gold. The progress of
      desolation by sea and land, from the Euxine to the Isle of
      Cyprus, compelled the emperor Nicephorus to retract his haughty
      defiance. In the new treaty, the ruins of Heraclea were left
      forever as a lesson and a trophy; and the coin of the tribute was
      marked with the image and superscription of Harun and his three
      sons. 78 Yet this plurality of lords might contribute to remove
      the dishonor of the Roman name. After the death of their father,
      the heirs of the caliph were involved in civil discord, and the
      conqueror, the liberal Almamon, was sufficiently engaged in the
      restoration of domestic peace and the introduction of foreign
      science.

      Chapter LII: More Conquests By The Arabs.—Part IV.

      Under the reign of Almamon at Bagdad, of Michael the Stammerer at
      Constantinople, the islands of Crete 79 and Sicily were subdued
      by the Arabs. The former of these conquests is disdained by their
      own writers, who were ignorant of the fame of Jupiter and Minos,
      but it has not been overlooked by the Byzantine historians, who
      now begin to cast a clearer light on the affairs of their own
      times. 80 A band of Andalusian volunteers, discontented with the
      climate or government of Spain, explored the adventures of the
      sea; but as they sailed in no more than ten or twenty galleys,
      their warfare must be branded with the name of piracy. As the
      subjects and sectaries of the white party, they might lawfully
      invade the dominions of the black caliphs. A rebellious faction
      introduced them into Alexandria; 81 they cut in pieces both
      friends and foes, pillaged the churches and the moschs, sold
      above six thousand Christian captives, and maintained their
      station in the capital of Egypt, till they were oppressed by the
      forces and the presence of Almamon himself. From the mouth of the
      Nile to the Hellespont, the islands and sea-coasts both of the
      Greeks and Moslems were exposed to their depredations; they saw,
      they envied, they tasted the fertility of Crete, and soon
      returned with forty galleys to a more serious attack. The
      Andalusians wandered over the land fearless and unmolested; but
      when they descended with their plunder to the sea-shore, their
      vessels were in flames, and their chief, Abu Caab, confessed
      himself the author of the mischief. Their clamors accused his
      madness or treachery. “Of what do you complain?” replied the
      crafty emir. “I have brought you to a land flowing with milk and
      honey. Here is your true country; repose from your toils, and
      forget the barren place of your nativity.” “And our wives and
      children?” “Your beauteous captives will supply the place of your
      wives, and in their embraces you will soon become the fathers of
      a new progeny.” The first habitation was their camp, with a ditch
      and rampart, in the Bay of Suda; but an apostate monk led them to
      a more desirable position in the eastern parts; and the name of
      Candax, their fortress and colony, has been extended to the whole
      island, under the corrupt and modern appellation of Candia. The
      hundred cities of the age of Minos were diminished to thirty; and
      of these, only one, most probably Cydonia, had courage to retain
      the substance of freedom and the profession of Christianity. The
      Saracens of Crete soon repaired the loss of their navy; and the
      timbers of Mount Ida were launched into the main. During a
      hostile period of one hundred and thirty-eight years, the princes
      of Constantinople attacked these licentious corsairs with
      fruitless curses and ineffectual arms.

      81 (return) [ Renaudot (Hist. Patriarch. Alex. p. 251-256,
      268-270) had described the ravages of the Andalusian Arabs in
      Egypt, but has forgot to connect them with the conquest of
      Crete.]

      The loss of Sicily 82 was occasioned by an act of superstitious
      rigor. An amorous youth, who had stolen a nun from her cloister,
      was sentenced by the emperor to the amputation of his tongue.
      Euphemius appealed to the reason and policy of the Saracens of
      Africa; and soon returned with the Imperial purple, a fleet of
      one hundred ships, and an army of seven hundred horse and ten
      thousand foot. They landed at Mazara near the ruins of the
      ancient Selinus; but after some partial victories, Syracuse 83
      was delivered by the Greeks, the apostate was slain before her
      walls, and his African friends were reduced to the necessity of
      feeding on the flesh of their own horses. In their turn they were
      relieved by a powerful reenforcement of their brethren of
      Andalusia; the largest and western part of the island was
      gradually reduced, and the commodious harbor of Palermo was
      chosen for the seat of the naval and military power of the
      Saracens. Syracuse preserved about fifty years the faith which
      she had sworn to Christ and to Caesar. In the last and fatal
      siege, her citizens displayed some remnant of the spirit which
      had formerly resisted the powers of Athens and Carthage. They
      stood above twenty days against the battering-rams and
      catapultoe, the mines and tortoises of the besiegers; and the
      place might have been relieved, if the mariners of the Imperial
      fleet had not been detained at Constantinople in building a
      church to the Virgin Mary. The deacon Theodosius, with the bishop
      and clergy, was dragged in chains from the altar to Palermo, cast
      into a subterraneous dungeon, and exposed to the hourly peril of
      death or apostasy. His pathetic, and not inelegant, complaint may
      be read as the epitaph of his country. 84 From the Roman conquest
      to this final calamity, Syracuse, now dwindled to the primitive
      Isle of Ortygea, had insensibly declined. Yet the relics were
      still precious; the plate of the cathedral weighed five thousand
      pounds of silver; the entire spoil was computed at one million of
      pieces of gold, (about four hundred thousand pounds sterling,)
      and the captives must outnumber the seventeen thousand
      Christians, who were transported from the sack of Tauromenium
      into African servitude. In Sicily, the religion and language of
      the Greeks were eradicated; and such was the docility of the
      rising generation, that fifteen thousand boys were circumcised
      and clothed on the same day with the son of the Fatimite caliph.
      The Arabian squadrons issued from the harbors of Palermo,
      Biserta, and Tunis; a hundred and fifty towns of Calabria and
      Campania were attacked and pillaged; nor could the suburbs of
      Rome be defended by the name of the Caesars and apostles. Had the
      Mahometans been united, Italy must have fallen an easy and
      glorious accession to the empire of the prophet. But the caliphs
      of Bagdad had lost their authority in the West; the Aglabites and
      Fatimites usurped the provinces of Africa, their emirs of Sicily
      aspired to independence; and the design of conquest and dominion
      was degraded to a repetition of predatory inroads. 85

      Guignes (Hist. des Huns, tom. i. p. 363, 364) has added some
      important facts.]

      In the sufferings of prostrate Italy, the name of Rome awakens a
      solemn and mournful recollection. A fleet of Saracens from the
      African coast presumed to enter the mouth of the Tyber, and to
      approach a city which even yet, in her fallen state, was revered
      as the metropolis of the Christian world. The gates and ramparts
      were guarded by a trembling people; but the tombs and temples of
      St. Peter and St. Paul were left exposed in the suburbs of the
      Vatican and of the Ostian way. Their invisible sanctity had
      protected them against the Goths, the Vandals, and the Lombards;
      but the Arabs disdained both the gospel and the legend; and their
      rapacious spirit was approved and animated by the precepts of the
      Koran. The Christian idols were stripped of their costly
      offerings; a silver altar was torn away from the shrine of St.
      Peter; and if the bodies or the buildings were left entire, their
      deliverance must be imputed to the haste, rather than the
      scruples, of the Saracens. In their course along the Appian way,
      they pillaged Fundi and besieged Gayeta; but they had turned
      aside from the walls of Rome, and by their divisions, the Capitol
      was saved from the yoke of the prophet of Mecca. The same danger
      still impended on the heads of the Roman people; and their
      domestic force was unequal to the assault of an African emir.
      They claimed the protection of their Latin sovereign; but the
      Carlovingian standard was overthrown by a detachment of the
      Barbarians: they meditated the restoration of the Greek emperors;
      but the attempt was treasonable, and the succor remote and
      precarious. 86 Their distress appeared to receive some
      aggravation from the death of their spiritual and temporal chief;
      but the pressing emergency superseded the forms and intrigues of
      an election; and the unanimous choice of Pope Leo the Fourth 87
      was the safety of the church and city. This pontiff was born a
      Roman; the courage of the first ages of the republic glowed in
      his breast; and, amidst the ruins of his country, he stood erect,
      like one of the firm and lofty columns that rear their heads
      above the fragments of the Roman forum. The first days of his
      reign were consecrated to the purification and removal of relics,
      to prayers and processions, and to all the solemn offices of
      religion, which served at least to heal the imagination, and
      restore the hopes, of the multitude. The public defence had been
      long neglected, not from the presumption of peace, but from the
      distress and poverty of the times. As far as the scantiness of
      his means and the shortness of his leisure would allow, the
      ancient walls were repaired by the command of Leo; fifteen
      towers, in the most accessible stations, were built or renewed;
      two of these commanded on either side of the Tyber; and an iron
      chain was drawn across the stream to impede the ascent of a
      hostile navy. The Romans were assured of a short respite by the
      welcome news, that the siege of Gayeta had been raised, and that
      a part of the enemy, with their sacrilegious plunder, had
      perished in the waves.

      87 (return) [ Voltaire (Hist. Generale, tom. ii. c. 38, p. 124)
      appears to be remarkably struck with the character of Pope Leo
      IV. I have borrowed his general expression, but the sight of the
      forum has furnished me with a more distinct and lively image.]

      But the storm, which had been delayed, soon burst upon them with
      redoubled violence. The Aglabite, 88 who reigned in Africa, had
      inherited from his father a treasure and an army: a fleet of
      Arabs and Moors, after a short refreshment in the harbors of
      Sardinia, cast anchor before the mouth of the Tyber, sixteen
      miles from the city: and their discipline and numbers appeared to
      threaten, not a transient inroad, but a serious design of
      conquest and dominion. But the vigilance of Leo had formed an
      alliance with the vassals of the Greek empire, the free and
      maritime states of Gayeta, Naples, and Amalfi; and in the hour of
      danger, their galleys appeared in the port of Ostia under the
      command of Caesarius, the son of the Neapolitan duke, a noble and
      valiant youth, who had already vanquished the fleets of the
      Saracens. With his principal companions, Caesarius was invited to
      the Lateran palace, and the dexterous pontiff affected to inquire
      their errand, and to accept with joy and surprise their
      providential succor. The city bands, in arms, attended their
      father to Ostia, where he reviewed and blessed his generous
      deliverers. They kissed his feet, received the communion with
      martial devotion, and listened to the prayer of Leo, that the
      same God who had supported St. Peter and St. Paul on the waves of
      the sea, would strengthen the hands of his champions against the
      adversaries of his holy name. After a similar prayer, and with
      equal resolution, the Moslems advanced to the attack of the
      Christian galleys, which preserved their advantageous station
      along the coast. The victory inclined to the side of the allies,
      when it was less gloriously decided in their favor by a sudden
      tempest, which confounded the skill and courage of the stoutest
      mariners. The Christians were sheltered in a friendly harbor,
      while the Africans were scattered and dashed in pieces among the
      rocks and islands of a hostile shore. Those who escaped from
      shipwreck and hunger neither found, nor deserved, mercy at the
      hands of their implacable pursuers. The sword and the gibbet
      reduced the dangerous multitude of captives; and the remainder
      was more usefully employed, to restore the sacred edifices which
      they had attempted to subvert. The pontiff, at the head of the
      citizens and allies, paid his grateful devotion at the shrines of
      the apostles; and, among the spoils of this naval victory,
      thirteen Arabian bows of pure and massy silver were suspended
      round the altar of the fishermen of Galilee. The reign of Leo the
      Fourth was employed in the defence and ornament of the Roman
      state. The churches were renewed and embellished: near four
      thousand pounds of silver were consecrated to repair the losses
      of St. Peter; and his sanctuary was decorated with a plate of
      gold of the weight of two hundred and sixteen pounds, embossed
      with the portraits of the pope and emperor, and encircled with a
      string of pearls. Yet this vain magnificence reflects less glory
      on the character of Leo than the paternal care with which he
      rebuilt the walls of Horta and Ameria; and transported the
      wandering inhabitants of Centumcellae to his new foundation of
      Leopolis, twelve miles from the sea-shore. 89 By his liberality,
      a colony of Corsicans, with their wives and children, was planted
      in the station of Porto, at the mouth of the Tyber: the falling
      city was restored for their use, the fields and vineyards were
      divided among the new settlers: their first efforts were assisted
      by a gift of horses and cattle; and the hardy exiles, who
      breathed revenge against the Saracens, swore to live and die
      under the standard of St. Peter. The nations of the West and
      North who visited the threshold of the apostles had gradually
      formed the large and populous suburb of the Vatican, and their
      various habitations were distinguished, in the language of the
      times, as the schools of the Greeks and Goths, of the Lombards
      and Saxons. But this venerable spot was still open to
      sacrilegious insult: the design of enclosing it with walls and
      towers exhausted all that authority could command, or charity
      would supply: and the pious labor of four years was animated in
      every season, and at every hour, by the presence of the
      indefatigable pontiff. The love of fame, a generous but worldly
      passion, may be detected in the name of the Leonine city, which
      he bestowed on the Vatican; yet the pride of the dedication was
      tempered with Christian penance and humility. The boundary was
      trod by the bishop and his clergy, barefoot, in sackcloth and
      ashes; the songs of triumph were modulated to psalms and
      litanies; the walls were besprinkled with holy water; and the
      ceremony was concluded with a prayer, that, under the guardian
      care of the apostles and the angelic host, both the old and the
      new Rome might ever be preserved pure, prosperous, and
      impregnable. 90

      The emperor Theophilus, son of Michael the Stammerer, was one of
      the most active and high-spirited princes who reigned at
      Constantinople during the middle age. In offensive or defensive
      war, he marched in person five times against the Saracens,
      formidable in his attack, esteemed by the enemy in his losses and
      defeats. In the last of these expeditions he penetrated into
      Syria, and besieged the obscure town of Sozopetra; the casual
      birthplace of the caliph Motassem, whose father Harun was
      attended in peace or war by the most favored of his wives and
      concubines. The revolt of a Persian impostor employed at that
      moment the arms of the Saracen, and he could only intercede in
      favor of a place for which he felt and acknowledged some degree
      of filial affection. These solicitations determined the emperor
      to wound his pride in so sensible a part. Sozopetra was levelled
      with the ground, the Syrian prisoners were marked or mutilated
      with ignominious cruelty, and a thousand female captives were
      forced away from the adjacent territory. Among these a matron of
      the house of Abbas invoked, in an agony of despair, the name of
      Motassem; and the insults of the Greeks engaged the honor of her
      kinsman to avenge his indignity, and to answer her appeal. Under
      the reign of the two elder brothers, the inheritance of the
      youngest had been confined to Anatolia, Armenia, Georgia, and
      Circassia; this frontier station had exercised his military
      talents; and among his accidental claims to the name of Octonary,
      91 the most meritorious are the eight battles which he gained or
      fought against the enemies of the Koran. In this personal
      quarrel, the troops of Irak, Syria, and Egypt, were recruited
      from the tribes of Arabia and the Turkish hordes; his cavalry
      might be numerous, though we should deduct some myriads from the
      hundred and thirty thousand horses of the royal stables; and the
      expense of the armament was computed at four millions sterling,
      or one hundred thousand pounds of gold. From Tarsus, the place of
      assembly, the Saracens advanced in three divisions along the high
      road of Constantinople: Motassem himself commanded the centre,
      and the vanguard was given to his son Abbas, who, in the trial of
      the first adventures, might succeed with the more glory, or fail
      with the least reproach. In the revenge of his injury, the caliph
      prepared to retaliate a similar affront. The father of Theophilus
      was a native of Amorium 92 in Phrygia: the original seat of the
      Imperial house had been adorned with privileges and monuments;
      and, whatever might be the indifference of the people,
      Constantinople itself was scarcely of more value in the eyes of
      the sovereign and his court. The name of Amorium was inscribed on
      the shields of the Saracens; and their three armies were again
      united under the walls of the devoted city. It had been proposed
      by the wisest counsellors, to evacuate Amorium, to remove the
      inhabitants, and to abandon the empty structures to the vain
      resentment of the Barbarians. The emperor embraced the more
      generous resolution of defending, in a siege and battle, the
      country of his ancestors. When the armies drew near, the front of
      the Mahometan line appeared to a Roman eye more closely planted
      with spears and javelins; but the event of the action was not
      glorious on either side to the national troops. The Arabs were
      broken, but it was by the swords of thirty thousand Persians, who
      had obtained service and settlement in the Byzantine empire. The
      Greeks were repulsed and vanquished, but it was by the arrows of
      the Turkish cavalry; and had not their bowstrings been damped and
      relaxed by the evening rain, very few of the Christians could
      have escaped with the emperor from the field of battle. They
      breathed at Dorylaeum, at the distance of three days; and
      Theophilus, reviewing his trembling squadrons, forgave the common
      flight both of the prince and people. After this discovery of his
      weakness, he vainly hoped to deprecate the fate of Amorium: the
      inexorable caliph rejected with contempt his prayers and
      promises; and detained the Roman ambassadors to be the witnesses
      of his great revenge. They had nearly been the witnesses of his
      shame. The vigorous assaults of fifty-five days were encountered
      by a faithful governor, a veteran garrison, and a desperate
      people; and the Saracens must have raised the siege, if a
      domestic traitor had not pointed to the weakest part of the wall,
      a place which was decorated with the statues of a lion and a
      bull. The vow of Motassem was accomplished with unrelenting
      rigor: tired, rather than satiated, with destruction, he returned
      to his new palace of Samara, in the neighborhood of Bagdad, while
      the unfortunate 93 Theophilus implored the tardy and doubtful aid
      of his Western rival the emperor of the Franks. Yet in the siege
      of Amorium about seventy thousand Moslems had perished: their
      loss had been revenged by the slaughter of thirty thousand
      Christians, and the sufferings of an equal number of captives,
      who were treated as the most atrocious criminals. Mutual
      necessity could sometimes extort the exchange or ransom of
      prisoners: 94 but in the national and religious conflict of the
      two empires, peace was without confidence, and war without mercy.
      Quarter was seldom given in the field; those who escaped the edge
      of the sword were condemned to hopeless servitude, or exquisite
      torture; and a Catholic emperor relates, with visible
      satisfaction, the execution of the Saracens of Crete, who were
      flayed alive, or plunged into caldrons of boiling oil. 95 To a
      point of honor Motassem had sacrificed a flourishing city, two
      hundred thousand lives, and the property of millions. The same
      caliph descended from his horse, and dirtied his robe, to relieve
      the distress of a decrepit old man, who, with his laden ass, had
      tumbled into a ditch. On which of these actions did he reflect
      with the most pleasure, when he was summoned by the angel of
      death? 96

      millions of gold.]

      of the bridge, and when they reached their respective friends,

      prisoners of Amorium were probably among them, but in the same
      year, (A. H. 231,) the most illustrious of them, the forty two
      martyrs, were beheaded by the caliph’s order.]

      With Motassem, the eighth of the Abbassides, the glory of his
      family and nation expired. When the Arabian conquerors had spread
      themselves over the East, and were mingled with the servile
      crowds of Persia, Syria, and Egypt, they insensibly lost the
      freeborn and martial virtues of the desert. The courage of the
      South is the artificial fruit of discipline and prejudice; the
      active power of enthusiasm had decayed, and the mercenary forces
      of the caliphs were recruited in those climates of the North, of
      which valor is the hardy and spontaneous production. Of the Turks
      97 who dwelt beyond the Oxus and Jaxartes, the robust youths,
      either taken in war or purchased in trade, were educated in the
      exercises of the field, and the profession of the Mahometan
      faith. The Turkish guards stood in arms round the throne of their
      benefactor, and their chiefs usurped the dominion of the palace
      and the provinces. Motassem, the first author of this dangerous
      example, introduced into the capital above fifty thousand Turks:
      their licentious conduct provoked the public indignation, and the
      quarrels of the soldiers and people induced the caliph to retire
      from Bagdad, and establish his own residence and the camp of his
      Barbarian favorites at Samara on the Tigris, about twelve leagues
      above the city of Peace. 98 His son Motawakkel was a jealous and
      cruel tyrant: odious to his subjects, he cast himself on the
      fidelity of the strangers, and these strangers, ambitious and
      apprehensive, were tempted by the rich promise of a revolution.
      At the instigation, or at least in the cause of his son, they
      burst into his apartment at the hour of supper, and the caliph
      was cut into seven pieces by the same swords which he had
      recently distributed among the guards of his life and throne. To
      this throne, yet streaming with a father’s blood, Montasser was
      triumphantly led; but in a reign of six months, he found only the
      pangs of a guilty conscience. If he wept at the sight of an old
      tapestry which represented the crime and punishment of the son of
      Chosroes, if his days were abridged by grief and remorse, we may
      allow some pity to a parricide, who exclaimed, in the bitterness
      of death, that he had lost both this world and the world to come.
      After this act of treason, the ensigns of royalty, the garment
      and walking-staff of Mahomet, were given and torn away by the
      foreign mercenaries, who in four years created, deposed, and
      murdered, three commanders of the faithful. As often as the Turks
      were inflamed by fear, or rage, or avarice, these caliphs were
      dragged by the feet, exposed naked to the scorching sun, beaten
      with iron clubs, and compelled to purchase, by the abdication of
      their dignity, a short reprieve of inevitable fate. 99 At length,
      however, the fury of the tempest was spent or diverted: the
      Abbassides returned to the less turbulent residence of Bagdad;
      the insolence of the Turks was curbed with a firmer and more
      skilful hand, and their numbers were divided and destroyed in
      foreign warfare. But the nations of the East had been taught to
      trample on the successors of the prophet; and the blessings of
      domestic peace were obtained by the relaxation of strength and
      discipline. So uniform are the mischiefs of military despotism,
      that I seem to repeat the story of the praetorians of Rome. 100

      While the flame of enthusiasm was damped by the business, the
      pleasure, and the knowledge, of the age, it burnt with
      concentrated heat in the breasts of the chosen few, the congenial
      spirits, who were ambitious of reigning either in this world or
      in the next. How carefully soever the book of prophecy had been
      sealed by the apostle of Mecca, the wishes, and (if we may
      profane the word) even the reason, of fanaticism might believe
      that, after the successive missions of Adam, Noah, Abraham,
      Moses, Jesus, and Mahomet, the same God, in the fulness of time,
      would reveal a still more perfect and permanent law. In the two
      hundred and seventy-seventh year of the Hegira, and in the
      neighborhood of Cufa, an Arabian preacher, of the name of
      Carmath, assumed the lofty and incomprehensible style of the
      Guide, the Director, the Demonstration, the Word, the Holy Ghost,
      the Camel, the Herald of the Messiah, who had conversed with him
      in a human shape, and the representative of Mohammed the son of
      Ali, of St. John the Baptist, and of the angel Gabriel. In his
      mystic volume, the precepts of the Koran were refined to a more
      spiritual sense: he relaxed the duties of ablution, fasting, and
      pilgrimage; allowed the indiscriminate use of wine and forbidden
      food; and nourished the fervor of his disciples by the daily
      repetition of fifty prayers. The idleness and ferment of the
      rustic crowd awakened the attention of the magistrates of Cufa; a
      timid persecution assisted the progress of the new sect; and the
      name of the prophet became more revered after his person had been
      withdrawn from the world. His twelve apostles dispersed
      themselves among the Bedoweens, “a race of men,” says Abulfeda,
      “equally devoid of reason and of religion;” and the success of
      their preaching seemed to threaten Arabia with a new revolution.
      The Carmathians were ripe for rebellion, since they disclaimed
      the title of the house of Abbas, and abhorred the worldly pomp of
      the caliphs of Bagdad. They were susceptible of discipline, since
      they vowed a blind and absolute submission to their Imam, who was
      called to the prophetic office by the voice of God and the
      people. Instead of the legal tithes, he claimed the fifth of
      their substance and spoil; the most flagitious sins were no more
      than the type of disobedience; and the brethren were united and
      concealed by an oath of secrecy. After a bloody conflict, they
      prevailed in the province of Bahrein, along the Persian Gulf: far
      and wide, the tribes of the desert were subject to the sceptre,
      or rather to the sword of Abu Said and his son Abu Taher; and
      these rebellious imams could muster in the field a hundred and
      seven thousand fanatics. The mercenaries of the caliph were
      dismayed at the approach of an enemy who neither asked nor
      accepted quarter; and the difference between, them in fortitude
      and patience, is expressive of the change which three centuries
      of prosperity had effected in the character of the Arabians. Such
      troops were discomfited in every action; the cities of Racca and
      Baalbec, of Cufa and Bassora, were taken and pillaged; Bagdad was
      filled with consternation; and the caliph trembled behind the
      veils of his palace. In a daring inroad beyond the Tigris, Abu
      Taher advanced to the gates of the capital with no more than five
      hundred horse. By the special order of Moctader, the bridges had
      been broken down, and the person or head of the rebel was
      expected every hour by the commander of the faithful. His
      lieutenant, from a motive of fear or pity, apprised Abu Taher of
      his danger, and recommended a speedy escape. “Your master,” said
      the intrepid Carmathian to the messenger, “is at the head of
      thirty thousand soldiers: three such men as these are wanting in
      his host:” at the same instant, turning to three of his
      companions, he commanded the first to plunge a dagger into his
      breast, the second to leap into the Tigris, and the third to cast
      himself headlong down a precipice. They obeyed without a murmur.

      “Relate,” continued the imam, “what you have seen: before the
      evening your general shall be chained among my dogs.” Before the
      evening, the camp was surprised, and the menace was executed. The
      rapine of the Carmathians was sanctified by their aversion to the
      worship of Mecca: they robbed a caravan of pilgrims, and twenty
      thousand devout Moslems were abandoned on the burning sands to a
      death of hunger and thirst. Another year they suffered the
      pilgrims to proceed without interruption; but, in the festival of
      devotion, Abu Taher stormed the holy city, and trampled on the
      most venerable relics of the Mahometan faith. Thirty thousand
      citizens and strangers were put to the sword; the sacred
      precincts were polluted by the burial of three thousand dead
      bodies; the well of Zemzem overflowed with blood; the golden
      spout was forced from its place; the veil of the Caaba was
      divided among these impious sectaries; and the black stone, the
      first monument of the nation, was borne away in triumph to their
      capital. After this deed of sacrilege and cruelty, they continued
      to infest the confines of Irak, Syria, and Egypt: but the vital
      principle of enthusiasm had withered at the root. Their scruples,
      or their avarice, again opened the pilgrimage of Mecca, and
      restored the black stone of the Caaba; and it is needless to
      inquire into what factions they were broken, or by whose swords
      they were finally extirpated. The sect of the Carmathians may be
      considered as the second visible cause of the decline and fall of
      the empire of the caliphs. 101

      Chapter LII: More Conquests By The Arabs.—Part V.

      The third and most obvious cause was the weight and magnitude of
      the empire itself. The caliph Almamon might proudly assert, that
      it was easier for him to rule the East and the West, than to
      manage a chess-board of two feet square: 102 yet I suspect that
      in both those games he was guilty of many fatal mistakes; and I
      perceive, that in the distant provinces the authority of the
      first and most powerful of the Abbassides was already impaired.
      The analogy of despotism invests the representative with the full
      majesty of the prince; the division and balance of powers might
      relax the habits of obedience, might encourage the passive
      subject to inquire into the origin and administration of civil
      government. He who is born in the purple is seldom worthy to
      reign; but the elevation of a private man, of a peasant, perhaps,
      or a slave, affords a strong presumption of his courage and
      capacity. The viceroy of a remote kingdom aspires to secure the
      property and inheritance of his precarious trust; the nations
      must rejoice in the presence of their sovereign; and the command
      of armies and treasures are at once the object and the instrument
      of his ambition. A change was scarcely visible as long as the
      lieutenants of the caliph were content with their vicarious
      title; while they solicited for themselves or their sons a
      renewal of the Imperial grant, and still maintained on the coin
      and in the public prayers the name and prerogative of the
      commander of the faithful. But in the long and hereditary
      exercise of power, they assumed the pride and attributes of
      royalty; the alternative of peace or war, of reward or
      punishment, depended solely on their will; and the revenues of
      their government were reserved for local services or private
      magnificence. Instead of a regular supply of men and money, the
      successors of the prophet were flattered with the ostentatious
      gift of an elephant, or a cast of hawks, a suit of silk hangings,
      or some pounds of musk and amber. 103

      After the revolt of Spain from the temporal and spiritual
      supremacy of the Abbassides, the first symptoms of disobedience
      broke forth in the province of Africa. Ibrahim, the son of Aglab,
      the lieutenant of the vigilant and rigid Harun, bequeathed to the
      dynasty of the Aglabites the inheritance of his name and power.
      The indolence or policy of the caliphs dissembled the injury and
      loss, and pursued only with poison the founder of the Edrisites,
      104 who erected the kingdom and city of Fez on the shores of the
      Western ocean. 105 In the East, the first dynasty was that of the
      Taherites; 106 the posterity of the valiant Taher, who, in the
      civil wars of the sons of Harun, had served with too much zeal
      and success the cause of Almamon, the younger brother. He was
      sent into honorable exile, to command on the banks of the Oxus;
      and the independence of his successors, who reigned in Chorasan
      till the fourth generation, was palliated by their modest and
      respectful demeanor, the happiness of their subjects and the
      security of their frontier. They were supplanted by one of those
      adventures so frequent in the annals of the East, who left his
      trade of a brazier (from whence the name of Soffarides) for the
      profession of a robber. In a nocturnal visit to the treasure of
      the prince of Sistan, Jacob, the son of Leith, stumbled over a
      lump of salt, which he unwarily tasted with his tongue. Salt,
      among the Orientals, is the symbol of hospitality, and the pious
      robber immediately retired without spoil or damage. The discovery
      of this honorable behavior recommended Jacob to pardon and trust;
      he led an army at first for his benefactor, at last for himself,
      subdued Persia, and threatened the residence of the Abbassides.
      On his march towards Bagdad, the conqueror was arrested by a
      fever. He gave audience in bed to the ambassador of the caliph;
      and beside him on a table were exposed a naked cimeter, a crust
      of brown bread, and a bunch of onions. “If I die,” said he, “your
      master is delivered from his fears. If I live, this must
      determine between us. If I am vanquished, I can return without
      reluctance to the homely fare of my youth.” From the height where
      he stood, the descent would not have been so soft or harmless: a
      timely death secured his own repose and that of the caliph, who
      paid with the most lavish concessions the retreat of his brother
      Amrou to the palaces of Shiraz and Ispahan. The Abbassides were
      too feeble to contend, too proud to forgive: they invited the
      powerful dynasty of the Samanides, who passed the Oxus with ten
      thousand horse so poor, that their stirrups were of wood: so
      brave, that they vanquished the Soffarian army, eight times more
      numerous than their own. The captive Amrou was sent in chains, a
      grateful offering to the court of Bagdad; and as the victor was
      content with the inheritance of Transoxiana and Chorasan, the
      realms of Persia returned for a while to the allegiance of the
      caliphs. The provinces of Syria and Egypt were twice dismembered
      by their Turkish slaves of the race of Toulon and Ilkshid. 107
      These Barbarians, in religion and manners the countrymen of
      Mahomet, emerged from the bloody factions of the palace to a
      provincial command and an independent throne: their names became
      famous and formidable in their time; but the founders of these
      two potent dynasties confessed, either in words or actions, the
      vanity of ambition. The first on his death-bed implored the mercy
      of God to a sinner, ignorant of the limits of his own power: the
      second, in the midst of four hundred thousand soldiers and eight
      thousand slaves, concealed from every human eye the chamber where
      he attempted to sleep. Their sons were educated in the vices of
      kings; and both Egypt and Syria were recovered and possessed by
      the Abbassides during an interval of thirty years. In the decline
      of their empire, Mesopotamia, with the important cities of Mosul
      and Aleppo, was occupied by the Arabian princes of the tribe of
      Hamadan. The poets of their court could repeat without a blush,
      that nature had formed their countenances for beauty, their
      tongues for eloquence, and their hands for liberality and valor:
      but the genuine tale of the elevation and reign of the
      Hamadanites exhibits a scene of treachery, murder, and parricide.

      At the same fatal period, the Persian kingdom was again usurped
      by the dynasty of the Bowides, by the sword of three brothers,
      who, under various names, were styled the support and columns of
      the state, and who, from the Caspian Sea to the ocean, would
      suffer no tyrants but themselves. Under their reign, the language
      and genius of Persia revived, and the Arabs, three hundred and
      four years after the death of Mahomet, were deprived of the
      sceptre of the East.

      Rahadi, the twentieth of the Abbassides, and the thirty-ninth of
      the successors of Mahomet, was the last who deserved the title of
      commander of the faithful; 108 the last (says Abulfeda) who spoke
      to the people, or conversed with the learned; the last who, in
      the expense of his household, represented the wealth and
      magnificence of the ancient caliphs. After him, the lords of the
      Eastern world were reduced to the most abject misery, and exposed
      to the blows and insults of a servile condition. The revolt of
      the provinces circumscribed their dominions within the walls of
      Bagdad: but that capital still contained an innumerable
      multitude, vain of their past fortune, discontented with their
      present state, and oppressed by the demands of a treasury which
      had formerly been replenished by the spoil and tribute of
      nations. Their idleness was exercised by faction and controversy.
      Under the mask of piety, the rigid followers of Hanbal 109
      invaded the pleasures of domestic life, burst into the houses of
      plebeians and princes, the wine, broke the instruments, beat the
      musicians, and dishonored, with infamous suspicions, the
      associates of every handsome youth. In each profession, which
      allowed room for two persons, the one was a votary, the other an
      antagonist, of Ali; and the Abbassides were awakened by the
      clamorous grief of the sectaries, who denied their title, and
      cursed their progenitors. A turbulent people could only be
      repressed by a military force; but who could satisfy the avarice
      or assert the discipline of the mercenaries themselves? The
      African and the Turkish guards drew their swords against each
      other, and the chief commanders, the emirs al Omra, 110
      imprisoned or deposed their sovereigns, and violated the
      sanctuary of the mosch and harem. If the caliphs escaped to the
      camp or court of any neighboring prince, their deliverance was a
      change of servitude, till they were prompted by despair to invite
      the Bowides, the sultans of Persia, who silenced the factions of
      Bagdad by their irresistible arms. The civil and military powers
      were assumed by Moezaldowlat, the second of the three brothers,
      and a stipend of sixty thousand pounds sterling was assigned by
      his generosity for the private expense of the commander of the
      faithful. But on the fortieth day, at the audience of the
      ambassadors of Chorasan, and in the presence of a trembling
      multitude, the caliph was dragged from his throne to a dungeon,
      by the command of the stranger, and the rude hands of his
      Dilamites. His palace was pillaged, his eyes were put out, and
      the mean ambition of the Abbassides aspired to the vacant station
      of danger and disgrace. In the school of adversity, the luxurious
      caliphs resumed the grave and abstemious virtues of the primitive
      times. Despoiled of their armor and silken robes, they fasted,
      they prayed, they studied the Koran and the tradition of the
      Sonnites: they performed, with zeal and knowledge, the functions
      of their ecclesiastical character. The respect of nations still
      waited on the successors of the apostle, the oracles of the law
      and conscience of the faithful; and the weakness or division of
      their tyrants sometimes restored the Abbassides to the
      sovereignty of Bagdad. But their misfortunes had been imbittered
      by the triumph of the Fatimites, the real or spurious progeny of
      Ali. Arising from the extremity of Africa, these successful
      rivals extinguished, in Egypt and Syria, both the spiritual and
      temporal authority of the Abbassides; and the monarch of the Nile
      insulted the humble pontiff on the banks of the Tigris.

      In the declining age of the caliphs, in the century which elapsed
      after the war of Theophilus and Motassem, the hostile
      transactions of the two nations were confined to some inroads by
      sea and land, the fruits of their close vicinity and indelible
      hatred. But when the Eastern world was convulsed and broken, the
      Greeks were roused from their lethargy by the hopes of conquest
      and revenge. The Byzantine empire, since the accession of the
      Basilian race, had reposed in peace and dignity; and they might
      encounter with their entire strength the front of some petty
      emir, whose rear was assaulted and threatened by his national
      foes of the Mahometan faith. The lofty titles of the morning
      star, and the death of the Saracens, 111 were applied in the
      public acclamations to Nicephorus Phocas, a prince as renowned in
      the camp, as he was unpopular in the city. In the subordinate
      station of great domestic, or general of the East, he reduced the
      Island of Crete, and extirpated the nest of pirates who had so
      long defied, with impunity, the majesty of the empire. 112 His
      military genius was displayed in the conduct and success of the
      enterprise, which had so often failed with loss and dishonor. The
      Saracens were confounded by the landing of his troops on safe and
      level bridges, which he cast from the vessels to the shore. Seven
      months were consumed in the siege of Candia; the despair of the
      native Cretans was stimulated by the frequent aid of their
      brethren of Africa and Spain; and after the massy wall and double
      ditch had been stormed by the Greeks a hopeless conflict was
      still maintained in the streets and houses of the city. 1121 The
      whole island was subdued in the capital, and a submissive people
      accepted, without resistance, the baptism of the conqueror. 113
      Constantinople applauded the long-forgotten pomp of a triumph;
      but the Imperial diadem was the sole reward that could repay the
      services, or satisfy the ambition, of Nicephorus.

      After the death of the younger Romanus, the fourth in lineal
      descent of the Basilian race, his widow Theophania successively
      married Nicephorus Phocas and his assassin John Zimisces, the two
      heroes of the age. They reigned as the guardians and colleagues
      of her infant sons; and the twelve years of their military
      command form the most splendid period of the Byzantine annals.
      The subjects and confederates, whom they led to war, appeared, at
      least in the eyes of an enemy, two hundred thousand strong; and
      of these about thirty thousand were armed with cuirasses: 114 a
      train of four thousand mules attended their march; and their
      evening camp was regularly fortified with an enclosure of iron
      spikes. A series of bloody and undecisive combats is nothing more
      than an anticipation of what would have been effected in a few
      years by the course of nature; but I shall briefly prosecute the
      conquests of the two emperors from the hills of Cappadocia to the
      desert of Bagdad. The sieges of Mopsuestia and Tarsus, in
      Cilicia, first exercised the skill and perseverance of their
      troops, on whom, at this moment, I shall not hesitate to bestow
      the name of Romans. In the double city of Mopsuestia, which is
      divided by the River Sarus, two hundred thousand Moslems were
      predestined to death or slavery, 115 a surprising degree of
      population, which must at least include the inhabitants of the
      dependent districts. They were surrounded and taken by assault;
      but Tarsus was reduced by the slow progress of famine; and no
      sooner had the Saracens yielded on honorable terms than they were
      mortified by the distant and unprofitable view of the naval
      succors of Egypt. They were dismissed with a safe-conduct to the
      confines of Syria: a part of the old Christians had quietly lived
      under their dominion; and the vacant habitations were replenished
      by a new colony. But the mosch was converted into a stable; the
      pulpit was delivered to the flames; many rich crosses of gold and
      gems, the spoils of Asiatic churches, were made a grateful
      offering to the piety or avarice of the emperor; and he
      transported the gates of Mopsuestia and Tarsus, which were fixed
      in the walls of Constantinople, an eternal monument of his
      victory. After they had forced and secured the narrow passes of
      Mount Amanus, the two Roman princes repeatedly carried their arms
      into the heart of Syria. Yet, instead of assaulting the walls of
      Antioch, the humanity or superstition of Nicephorus appeared to
      respect the ancient metropolis of the East: he contented himself
      with drawing round the city a line of circumvallation; left a
      stationary army; and instructed his lieutenant to expect, without
      impatience, the return of spring. But in the depth of winter, in
      a dark and rainy night, an adventurous subaltern, with three
      hundred soldiers, approached the rampart, applied his
      scaling-ladders, occupied two adjacent towers, stood firm against
      the pressure of multitudes, and bravely maintained his post till
      he was relieved by the tardy, though effectual, support of his
      reluctant chief. The first tumult of slaughter and rapine
      subsided; the reign of Caesar and of Christ was restored; and the
      efforts of a hundred thousand Saracens, of the armies of Syria
      and the fleets of Africa, were consumed without effect before the
      walls of Antioch. The royal city of Aleppo was subject to
      Seifeddowlat, of the dynasty of Hamadan, who clouded his past
      glory by the precipitate retreat which abandoned his kingdom and
      capital to the Roman invaders. In his stately palace, that stood
      without the walls of Aleppo, they joyfully seized a
      well-furnished magazine of arms, a stable of fourteen hundred
      mules, and three hundred bags of silver and gold. But the walls
      of the city withstood the strokes of their battering-rams: and
      the besiegers pitched their tents on the neighboring mountain of
      Jaushan. Their retreat exasperated the quarrel of the townsmen
      and mercenaries; the guard of the gates and ramparts was
      deserted; and while they furiously charged each other in the
      market-place, they were surprised and destroyed by the sword of a
      common enemy. The male sex was exterminated by the sword; ten
      thousand youths were led into captivity; the weight of the
      precious spoil exceeded the strength and number of the beasts of
      burden; the superfluous remainder was burnt; and, after a
      licentious possession of ten days, the Romans marched away from
      the naked and bleeding city. In their Syrian inroads they
      commanded the husbandmen to cultivate their lands, that they
      themselves, in the ensuing season, might reap the benefit; more
      than a hundred cities were reduced to obedience; and eighteen
      pulpits of the principal moschs were committed to the flames to
      expiate the sacrilege of the disciples of Mahomet. The classic
      names of Hierapolis, Apamea, and Emesa, revive for a moment in
      the list of conquest: the emperor Zimisces encamped in the
      paradise of Damascus, and accepted the ransom of a submissive
      people; and the torrent was only stopped by the impregnable
      fortress of Tripoli, on the sea-coast of Phoenicia. Since the
      days of Heraclius, the Euphrates, below the passage of Mount
      Taurus, had been impervious, and almost invisible, to the Greeks.

      The river yielded a free passage to the victorious Zimisces; and
      the historian may imitate the speed with which he overran the
      once famous cities of Samosata, Edessa, Martyropolis, Amida, 116
      and Nisibis, the ancient limit of the empire in the neighborhood
      of the Tigris. His ardor was quickened by the desire of grasping
      the virgin treasures of Ecbatana, 117 a well-known name, under
      which the Byzantine writer has concealed the capital of the
      Abbassides. The consternation of the fugitives had already
      diffused the terror of his name; but the fancied riches of Bagdad
      had already been dissipated by the avarice and prodigality of
      domestic tyrants. The prayers of the people, and the stern
      demands of the lieutenant of the Bowides, required the caliph to
      provide for the defence of the city. The helpless Mothi replied,
      that his arms, his revenues, and his provinces, had been torn
      from his hands, and that he was ready to abdicate a dignity which
      he was unable to support. The emir was inexorable; the furniture
      of the palace was sold; and the paltry price of forty thousand
      pieces of gold was instantly consumed in private luxury. But the
      apprehensions of Bagdad were relieved by the retreat of the
      Greeks: thirst and hunger guarded the desert of Mesopotamia; and
      the emperor, satiated with glory, and laden with Oriental spoils,
      returned to Constantinople, and displayed, in his triumph, the
      silk, the aromatics, and three hundred myriads of gold and
      silver. Yet the powers of the East had been bent, not broken, by
      this transient hurricane. After the departure of the Greeks, the
      fugitive princes returned to their capitals; the subjects
      disclaimed their involuntary oaths of allegiance; the Moslems
      again purified their temples, and overturned the idols of the
      saints and martyrs; the Nestorians and Jacobites preferred a
      Saracen to an orthodox master; and the numbers and spirit of the
      Melchites were inadequate to the support of the church and state.

      Of these extensive conquests, Antioch, with the cities of Cilicia
      and the Isle of Cyprus, was alone restored, a permanent and
      useful accession to the Roman empire. 118

      (tom. ii. l. xvi. p. 199—l. xvii. 215) and Cedrenus, (Compend. p.
      649-684.) Their manifold defects are partly supplied by the Ms.
      history of Leo the deacon, which Pagi obtained from the
      Benedictines, and has inserted almost entire, in a Latin version,
      (Critica, tom. iii. p. 873, tom. iv. 37.) * Note: The whole
      original work of Leo the Deacon has been published by Hase, and
      is inserted in the new edition of the Byzantine historians. M
      Lassen has added to the Arabian authorities of this period some
      extracts from Kemaleddin’s account of the treaty for the
      surrender of Aleppo.—M.]
