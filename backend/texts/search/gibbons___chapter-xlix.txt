     Introduction, Worship, And Persecution Of Images.—Revolt Of Italy
     And Rome.—Temporal Dominion Of The Popes.—Conquest Of Italy By The
     Franks.—Establishment Of Images.—Character And Coronation Of
     Charlemagne.—Restoration And Decay Of The Roman Empire In The
     West.—Independence Of Italy.— Constitution Of The Germanic Body.

      In the connection of the church and state, I have considered the
      former as subservient only, and relative, to the latter; a
      salutary maxim, if in fact, as well as in narrative, it had ever
      been held sacred. The Oriental philosophy of the Gnostics, the
      dark abyss of predestination and grace, and the strange
      transformation of the Eucharist from the sign to the substance of
      Christ’s body, 1 I have purposely abandoned to the curiosity of
      speculative divines. But I have reviewed, with diligence and
      pleasure, the objects of ecclesiastical history, by which the
      decline and fall of the Roman empire were materially affected,
      the propagation of Christianity, the constitution of the Catholic
      church, the ruin of Paganism, and the sects that arose from the
      mysterious controversies concerning the Trinity and incarnation.
      At the head of this class, we may justly rank the worship of
      images, so fiercely disputed in the eighth and ninth centuries;
      since a question of popular superstition produced the revolt of
      Italy, the temporal power of the popes, and the restoration of
      the Roman empire in the West.

      1 (return) [ The learned Selden has given the history of
      transubstantiation in a comprehensive and pithy sentence: “This
      opinion is only rhetoric turned into logic,” (his Works, vol.
      iii. p. 2037, in his Table-Talk.)]

      The primitive Christians were possessed with an unconquerable
      repugnance to the use and abuse of images; and this aversion may
      be ascribed to their descent from the Jews, and their enmity to
      the Greeks. The Mosaic law had severely proscribed all
      representations of the Deity; and that precept was firmly
      established in the principles and practice of the chosen people.
      The wit of the Christian apologists was pointed against the
      foolish idolaters, who bowed before the workmanship of their own
      hands; the images of brass and marble, which, had they been
      endowed with sense and motion, should have started rather from
      the pedestal to adore the creative powers of the artist. 2
      Perhaps some recent and imperfect converts of the Gnostic tribe
      might crown the statues of Christ and St. Paul with the profane
      honors which they paid to those of Aristotle and Pythagoras; 3
      but the public religion of the Catholics was uniformly simple and
      spiritual; and the first notice of the use of pictures is in the
      censure of the council of Illiberis, three hundred years after
      the Christian aera. Under the successors of Constantine, in the
      peace and luxury of the triumphant church, the more prudent
      bishops condescended to indulge a visible superstition, for the
      benefit of the multitude; and, after the ruin of Paganism, they
      were no longer restrained by the apprehension of an odious
      parallel. The first introduction of a symbolic worship was in the
      veneration of the cross, and of relics. The saints and martyrs,
      whose intercession was implored, were seated on the right hand of
      God; but the gracious and often supernatural favors, which, in
      the popular belief, were showered round their tomb, conveyed an
      unquestionable sanction of the devout pilgrims, who visited, and
      touched, and kissed these lifeless remains, the memorials of
      their merits and sufferings. 4 But a memorial, more interesting
      than the skull or the sandals of a departed worthy, is the
      faithful copy of his person and features, delineated by the arts
      of painting or sculpture. In every age, such copies, so congenial
      to human feelings, have been cherished by the zeal of private
      friendship, or public esteem: the images of the Roman emperors
      were adored with civil, and almost religious, honors; a reverence
      less ostentatious, but more sincere, was applied to the statues
      of sages and patriots; and these profane virtues, these splendid
      sins, disappeared in the presence of the holy men, who had died
      for their celestial and everlasting country. At first, the
      experiment was made with caution and scruple; and the venerable
      pictures were discreetly allowed to instruct the ignorant, to
      awaken the cold, and to gratify the prejudices of the heathen
      proselytes. By a slow though inevitable progression, the honors
      of the original were transferred to the copy: the devout
      Christian prayed before the image of a saint; and the Pagan rites
      of genuflection, luminaries, and incense, again stole into the
      Catholic church. The scruples of reason, or piety, were silenced
      by the strong evidence of visions and miracles; and the pictures
      which speak, and move, and bleed, must be endowed with a divine
      energy, and may be considered as the proper objects of religious
      adoration. The most audacious pencil might tremble in the rash
      attempt of defining, by forms and colors, the infinite Spirit,
      the eternal Father, who pervades and sustains the universe. 5 But
      the superstitious mind was more easily reconciled to paint and to
      worship the angels, and, above all, the Son of God, under the
      human shape, which, on earth, they have condescended to assume.
      The second person of the Trinity had been clothed with a real and
      mortal body; but that body had ascended into heaven: and, had not
      some similitude been presented to the eyes of his disciples, the
      spiritual worship of Christ might have been obliterated by the
      visible relics and representations of the saints. A similar
      indulgence was requisite and propitious for the Virgin Mary: the
      place of her burial was unknown; and the assumption of her soul
      and body into heaven was adopted by the credulity of the Greeks
      and Latins. The use, and even the worship, of images was firmly
      established before the end of the sixth century: they were fondly
      cherished by the warm imagination of the Greeks and Asiatics: the
      Pantheon and Vatican were adorned with the emblems of a new
      superstition; but this semblance of idolatry was more coldly
      entertained by the rude Barbarians and the Arian clergy of the
      West. The bolder forms of sculpture, in brass or marble, which
      peopled the temples of antiquity, were offensive to the fancy or
      conscience of the Christian Greeks: and a smooth surface of
      colors has ever been esteemed a more decent and harmless mode of
      imitation. 6

      xxiid book of the Hist. des Eglises Reformees of Basnage, tom.
      ii. p. 1310-1337. He was a Protestant, but of a manly spirit; and
      on this head the Protestants are so notoriously in the right,
      that they can venture to be impartial. See the perplexity of poor
      Friar Pagi, Critica, tom. i. p. 42.]

      The merit and effect of a copy depends on its resemblance with
      the original; but the primitive Christians were ignorant of the
      genuine features of the Son of God, his mother, and his apostles:
      the statue of Christ at Paneas in Palestine 7 was more probably
      that of some temporal savior; the Gnostics and their profane
      monuments were reprobated; and the fancy of the Christian artists
      could only be guided by the clandestine imitation of some heathen
      model. In this distress, a bold and dexterous invention assured
      at once the likeness of the image and the innocence of the
      worship. A new super structure of fable was raised on the popular
      basis of a Syrian legend, on the correspondence of Christ and
      Abgarus, so famous in the days of Eusebius, so reluctantly
      deserted by our modern advocates. The bishop of Caesarea 8
      records the epistle, 9 but he most strangely forgets the picture
      of Christ; 10 the perfect impression of his face on a linen, with
      which he gratified the faith of the royal stranger who had
      invoked his healing power, and offered the strong city of Edessa
      to protect him against the malice of the Jews. The ignorance of
      the primitive church is explained by the long imprisonment of the
      image in a niche of the wall, from whence, after an oblivion of
      five hundred years, it was released by some prudent bishop, and
      seasonably presented to the devotion of the times. Its first and
      most glorious exploit was the deliverance of the city from the
      arms of Chosroes Nushirvan; and it was soon revered as a pledge
      of the divine promise, that Edessa should never be taken by a
      foreign enemy. It is true, indeed, that the text of Procopius
      ascribes the double deliverance of Edessa to the wealth and valor
      of her citizens, who purchased the absence and repelled the
      assaults of the Persian monarch. He was ignorant, the profane
      historian, of the testimony which he is compelled to deliver in
      the ecclesiastical page of Evagrius, that the Palladium was
      exposed on the rampart, and that the water which had been
      sprinkled on the holy face, instead of quenching, added new fuel
      to the flames of the besieged. After this important service, the
      image of Edessa was preserved with respect and gratitude; and if
      the Armenians rejected the legend, the more credulous Greeks
      adored the similitude, which was not the work of any mortal
      pencil, but the immediate creation of the divine original. The
      style and sentiments of a Byzantine hymn will declare how far
      their worship was removed from the grossest idolatry. “How can we
      with mortal eyes contemplate this image, whose celestial splendor
      the host of heaven presumes not to behold? He who dwells in
      heaven, condescends this day to visit us by his venerable image;
      He who is seated on the cherubim, visits us this day by a
      picture, which the Father has delineated with his immaculate
      hand, which he has formed in an ineffable manner, and which we
      sanctify by adoring it with fear and love.” Before the end of the
      sixth century, these images, made without hands, (in Greek it is
      a single word, 11 were propagated in the camps and cities of the
      Eastern empire: 12 they were the objects of worship, and the
      instruments of miracles; and in the hour of danger or tumult,
      their venerable presence could revive the hope, rekindle the
      courage, or repress the fury, of the Roman legions. Of these
      pictures, the far greater part, the transcripts of a human
      pencil, could only pretend to a secondary likeness and improper
      title: but there were some of higher descent, who derived their
      resemblance from an immediate contact with the original, endowed,
      for that purpose, with a miraculous and prolific virtue. The most
      ambitious aspired from a filial to a fraternal relation with the
      image of Edessa; and such is the veronica of Rome, or Spain, or
      Jerusalem, which Christ in his agony and bloody sweat applied to
      his face, and delivered to a holy matron. The fruitful precedent
      was speedily transferred to the Virgin Mary, and the saints and
      martyrs. In the church of Diospolis, in Palestine, the features
      of the Mother of God 13 were deeply inscribed in a marble column;
      the East and West have been decorated by the pencil of St. Luke;
      and the Evangelist, who was perhaps a physician, has been forced
      to exercise the occupation of a painter, so profane and odious in
      the eyes of the primitive Christians. The Olympian Jove, created
      by the muse of Homer and the chisel of Phidias, might inspire a
      philosophic mind with momentary devotion; but these Catholic
      images were faintly and flatly delineated by monkish artists in
      the last degeneracy of taste and genius. 14

      7 (return) [ After removing some rubbish of miracle and
      inconsistency, it may be allowed, that as late as the year 300,
      Paneas in Palestine was decorated with a bronze statue,
      representing a grave personage wrapped in a cloak, with a
      grateful or suppliant female kneeling before him, and that an
      inscription was perhaps inscribed on the pedestal. By the
      Christians, this group was foolishly explained of their founder
      and the poor woman whom he had cured of the bloody flux, (Euseb.
      vii. 18, Philostorg. vii. 3, &c.) M. de Beausobre more reasonably
      conjectures the philosopher Apollonius, or the emperor Vespasian:
      in the latter supposition, the female is a city, a province, or
      perhaps the queen Berenice, (Bibliotheque Germanique, tom. xiii.
      p. 1-92.)]

      8 (return) [ Euseb. Hist. Eccles. l. i. c. 13. The learned

      not find any notice of the Syriac original or the archives of
      Edessa, (Bibliot. Orient. tom. i. p. 318, 420, 554;) their vague
      belief is probably derived from the Greeks.]

      9 (return) [ The evidence for these epistles is stated and
      rejected by the candid Lardner, (Heathen Testimonies, vol. i. p.

      this convenient, but untenable, post, I am ashamed, with the
      Grabes, Caves, Tillemonts, &c., to discover Mr. Addison, an
      English gentleman, (his Works, vol. i. p. 528, Baskerville’s
      edition;) but his superficial tract on the Christian religion
      owes its credit to his name, his style, and the interested
      applause of our clergy.]

      Bibliot. Orient. p. 289, 318,) and the testimony of Evagrius,
      (Hist. Eccles. l. iv. c. 27,) I conclude that this fable was
      invented between the years 521 and 594, most probably after the
      siege of Edessa in 540, (Asseman. tom. i. p. 416. Procopius, de

      he adds (of Edessa). See Pagi, tom. ii. A.D. 588 No. 11.]

      13 (return) [ See, in the genuine or supposed works of John
      Damascenus, two passages on the Virgin and St. Luke, which have
      not been noticed by Gretser, nor consequently by Beausobre,
      (Opera Joh. Damascen. tom. i. p. 618, 631.)]

      14 (return) [ “Your scandalous figures stand quite out from the
      canvass: they are as bad as a group of statues!” It was thus that
      the ignorance and bigotry of a Greek priest applauded the
      pictures of Titian, which he had ordered, and refused to accept.]

      The worship of images had stolen into the church by insensible
      degrees, and each petty step was pleasing to the superstitious
      mind, as productive of comfort, and innocent of sin. But in the
      beginning of the eighth century, in the full magnitude of the
      abuse, the more timorous Greeks were awakened by an apprehension,
      that under the mask of Christianity, they had restored the
      religion of their fathers: they heard, with grief and impatience,
      the name of idolaters; the incessant charge of the Jews and
      Mahometans, 15 who derived from the Law and the Koran an immortal
      hatred to graven images and all relative worship. The servitude
      of the Jews might curb their zeal, and depreciate their
      authority; but the triumphant Mussulmans, who reigned at
      Damascus, and threatened Constantinople, cast into the scale of
      reproach the accumulated weight of truth and victory. The cities
      of Syria, Palestine, and Egypt had been fortified with the images
      of Christ, his mother, and his saints; and each city presumed on
      the hope or promise of miraculous defence. In a rapid conquest of
      ten years, the Arabs subdued those cities and these images; and,
      in their opinion, the Lord of Hosts pronounced a decisive
      judgment between the adoration and contempt of these mute and
      inanimate idols. 1511 For a while Edessa had braved the Persian
      assaults; but the chosen city, the spouse of Christ, was involved
      in the common ruin; and his divine resemblance became the slave
      and trophy of the infidels. After a servitude of three hundred
      years, the Palladium was yielded to the devotion of
      Constantinople, for a ransom of twelve thousand pounds of silver,
      the redemption of two hundred Mussulmans, and a perpetual truce
      for the territory of Edessa. 16 In this season of distress and
      dismay, the eloquence of the monks was exercised in the defence
      of images; and they attempted to prove, that the sin and schism
      of the greatest part of the Orientals had forfeited the favor,
      and annihilated the virtue, of these precious symbols. But they
      were now opposed by the murmurs of many simple or rational
      Christians, who appealed to the evidence of texts, of facts, and
      of the primitive times, and secretly desired the reformation of
      the church. As the worship of images had never been established
      by any general or positive law, its progress in the Eastern
      empire had been retarded, or accelerated, by the differences of
      men and manners, the local degrees of refinement, and the
      personal characters of the bishops. The splendid devotion was
      fondly cherished by the levity of the capital, and the inventive
      genius of the Byzantine clergy; while the rude and remote
      districts of Asia were strangers to this innovation of sacred
      luxury. Many large congregations of Gnostics and Arians
      maintained, after their conversion, the simple worship which had
      preceded their separation; and the Armenians, the most warlike
      subjects of Rome, were not reconciled, in the twelfth century, to
      the sight of images. 17 These various denominations of men
      afforded a fund of prejudice and aversion, of small account in
      the villages of Anatolia or Thrace, but which, in the fortune of
      a soldier, a prelate, or a eunuch, might be often connected with
      the powers of the church and state.

      15 (return) [ By Cedrenus, Zonaras, Glycas, and Manasses, the
      origin of the Aconoclcasts is imprinted to the caliph Yezid and
      two Jews, who promised the empire to Leo; and the reproaches of
      these hostile sectaries are turned into an absurd conspiracy for
      restoring the purity of the Christian worship, (see Spanheim,
      Hist. Imag. c. 2.)]

      1511 (return) [ Yezid, ninth caliph of the race of the Ommiadae,
      caused all the images in Syria to be destroyed about the year
      719; hence the orthodox reproaches the sectaries with following

      Abulpharagius, (Dynast. p. 201,) and Abulfeda, (Annal. Moslem. p.
      264,), and the criticisms of Pagi, (tom. iii. A.D. 944.) The
      prudent Franciscan refuses to determine whether the image of
      Edessa now reposes at Rome or Genoa; but its repose is
      inglorious, and this ancient object of worship is no longer
      famous or fashionable.]

      17 (return) [ (Nicetas, l. ii. p. 258.) The Armenian churches are
      still content with the Cross, (Missions du Levant, tom. iii. p.
      148;) but surely the superstitious Greek is unjust to the
      superstition of the Germans of the xiith century.]

      Of such adventurers, the most fortunate was the emperor Leo the
      Third, 18 who, from the mountains of Isauria, ascended the throne
      of the East. He was ignorant of sacred and profane letters; but
      his education, his reason, perhaps his intercourse with the Jews
      and Arabs, had inspired the martial peasant with a hatred of
      images; and it was held to be the duty of a prince to impose on
      his subjects the dictates of his own conscience. But in the
      outset of an unsettled reign, during ten years of toil and
      danger, Leo submitted to the meanness of hypocrisy, bowed before
      the idols which he despised, and satisfied the Roman pontiff with
      the annual professions of his orthodoxy and zeal. In the
      reformation of religion, his first steps were moderate and
      cautious: he assembled a great council of senators and bishops,
      and enacted, with their consent, that all the images should be
      removed from the sanctuary and altar to a proper height in the
      churches where they might be visible to the eyes, and
      inaccessible to the superstition, of the people. But it was
      impossible on either side to check the rapid through adverse
      impulse of veneration and abhorrence: in their lofty position,
      the sacred images still edified their votaries, and reproached
      the tyrant. He was himself provoked by resistance and invective;
      and his own party accused him of an imperfect discharge of his
      duty, and urged for his imitation the example of the Jewish king,
      who had broken without scruple the brazen serpent of the temple.
      By a second edict, he proscribed the existence as well as the use
      of religious pictures; the churches of Constantinople and the
      provinces were cleansed from idolatry; the images of Christ, the
      Virgin, and the saints, were demolished, or a smooth surface of
      plaster was spread over the walls of the edifice. The sect of the
      Iconoclasts was supported by the zeal and despotism of six
      emperors, and the East and West were involved in a noisy conflict
      of one hundred and twenty years. It was the design of Leo the
      Isaurian to pronounce the condemnation of images as an article of
      faith, and by the authority of a general council: but the
      convocation of such an assembly was reserved for his son
      Constantine; 19 and though it is stigmatized by triumphant
      bigotry as a meeting of fools and atheists, their own partial and
      mutilated acts betray many symptoms of reason and piety. The
      debates and decrees of many provincial synods introduced the
      summons of the general council which met in the suburbs of
      Constantinople, and was composed of the respectable number of
      three hundred and thirty-eight bishops of Europe and Anatolia;
      for the patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria were the slaves of
      the caliph, and the Roman pontiff had withdrawn the churches of
      Italy and the West from the communion of the Greeks. This
      Byzantine synod assumed the rank and powers of the seventh
      general council; yet even this title was a recognition of the six
      preceding assemblies, which had laboriously built the structure
      of the Catholic faith. After a serious deliberation of six
      months, the three hundred and thirty-eight bishops pronounced and
      subscribed a unanimous decree, that all visible symbols of
      Christ, except in the Eucharist, were either blasphemous or
      heretical; that image-worship was a corruption of Christianity
      and a renewal of Paganism; that all such monuments of idolatry
      should be broken or erased; and that those who should refuse to
      deliver the objects of their private superstition, were guilty of
      disobedience to the authority of the church and of the emperor.
      In their loud and loyal acclamations, they celebrated the merits
      of their temporal redeemer; and to his zeal and justice they
      intrusted the execution of their spiritual censures. At
      Constantinople, as in the former councils, the will of the prince
      was the rule of episcopal faith; but on this occasion, I am
      inclined to suspect that a large majority of the prelates
      sacrificed their secret conscience to the temptations of hope and
      fear. In the long night of superstition, the Christians had
      wandered far away from the simplicity of the gospel: nor was it
      easy for them to discern the clew, and tread back the mazes, of
      the labyrinth. The worship of images was inseparably blended, at
      least to a pious fancy, with the Cross, the Virgin, the Saints
      and their relics; the holy ground was involved in a cloud of
      miracles and visions; and the nerves of the mind, curiosity and
      scepticism, were benumbed by the habits of obedience and belief.
      Constantine himself is accused of indulging a royal license to
      doubt, or deny, or deride the mysteries of the Catholics, 20 but
      they were deeply inscribed in the public and private creed of his
      bishops; and the boldest Iconoclast might assault with a secret
      horror the monuments of popular devotion, which were consecrated
      to the honor of his celestial patrons. In the reformation of the
      sixteenth century, freedom and knowledge had expanded all the
      faculties of man: the thirst of innovation superseded the
      reverence of antiquity; and the vigor of Europe could disdain
      those phantoms which terrified the sickly and servile weakness of
      the Greeks.

      The scandal of an abstract heresy can be only proclaimed to the
      people by the blast of the ecclesiastical trumpet; but the most
      ignorant can perceive, the most torpid must feel, the profanation
      and downfall of their visible deities. The first hostilities of
      Leo were directed against a lofty Christ on the vestibule, and
      above the gate, of the palace. A ladder had been planted for the
      assault, but it was furiously shaken by a crowd of zealots and
      women: they beheld, with pious transport, the ministers of
      sacrilege tumbling from on high and dashed against the pavement:
      and the honors of the ancient martyrs were prostituted to these
      criminals, who justly suffered for murder and rebellion. 21 The
      execution of the Imperial edicts was resisted by frequent tumults
      in Constantinople and the provinces: the person of Leo was
      endangered, his officers were massacred, and the popular
      enthusiasm was quelled by the strongest efforts of the civil and
      military power. Of the Archipelago, or Holy Sea, the numerous
      islands were filled with images and monks: their votaries
      abjured, without scruple, the enemy of Christ, his mother, and
      the saints; they armed a fleet of boats and galleys, displayed
      their consecrated banners, and boldly steered for the harbor of
      Constantinople, to place on the throne a new favorite of God and
      the people. They depended on the succor of a miracle: but their
      miracles were inefficient against the Greek fire; and, after the
      defeat and conflagration of the fleet, the naked islands were
      abandoned to the clemency or justice of the conqueror. The son of
      Leo, in the first year of his reign, had undertaken an expedition
      against the Saracens: during his absence, the capital, the
      palace, and the purple, were occupied by his kinsman Artavasdes,
      the ambitious champion of the orthodox faith. The worship of
      images was triumphantly restored: the patriarch renounced his
      dissimulation, or dissembled his sentiments and the righteous
      claims of the usurper was acknowledged, both in the new, and in
      ancient, Rome. Constantine flew for refuge to his paternal
      mountains; but he descended at the head of the bold and
      affectionate Isaurians; and his final victory confounded the arms
      and predictions of the fanatics. His long reign was distracted
      with clamor, sedition, conspiracy, and mutual hatred, and
      sanguinary revenge; the persecution of images was the motive or
      pretence, of his adversaries; and, if they missed a temporal
      diadem, they were rewarded by the Greeks with the crown of
      martyrdom. In every act of open and clandestine treason, the
      emperor felt the unforgiving enmity of the monks, the faithful
      slaves of the superstition to which they owed their riches and
      influence. They prayed, they preached, they absolved, they
      inflamed, they conspired; the solitude of Palestine poured forth
      a torrent of invective; and the pen of St. John Damascenus, 22
      the last of the Greek fathers, devoted the tyrant’s head, both in
      this world and the next. 23 2311 I am not at leisure to examine
      how far the monks provoked, nor how much they have exaggerated,
      their real and pretended sufferings, nor how many lost their
      lives or limbs, their eyes or their beards, by the cruelty of the
      emperor. 2312 From the chastisement of individuals, he proceeded
      to the abolition of the order; and, as it was wealthy and
      useless, his resentment might be stimulated by avarice, and
      justified by patriotism. The formidable name and mission of the
      Dragon, 24 his visitor-general, excited the terror and abhorrence
      of the black nation: the religious communities were dissolved,
      the buildings were converted into magazines, or barracks; the
      lands, movables, and cattle were confiscated; and our modern
      precedents will support the charge, that much wanton or malicious
      havoc was exercised against the relics, and even the books of the
      monasteries. With the habit and profession of monks, the public
      and private worship of images was rigorously proscribed; and it
      should seem, that a solemn abjuration of idolatry was exacted
      from the subjects, or at least from the clergy, of the Eastern
      empire. 25

      compilation]

      The patient East abjured, with reluctance, her sacred images;
      they were fondly cherished, and vigorously defended, by the
      independent zeal of the Italians. In ecclesiastical rank and
      jurisdiction, the patriarch of Constantinople and the pope of
      Rome were nearly equal. But the Greek prelate was a domestic
      slave under the eye of his master, at whose nod he alternately
      passed from the convent to the throne, and from the throne to the
      convent. A distant and dangerous station, amidst the Barbarians
      of the West, excited the spirit and freedom of the Latin bishops.

      Their popular election endeared them to the Romans: the public
      and private indigence was relieved by their ample revenue; and
      the weakness or neglect of the emperors compelled them to
      consult, both in peace and war, the temporal safety of the city.
      In the school of adversity the priest insensibly imbibed the
      virtues and the ambition of a prince; the same character was
      assumed, the same policy was adopted, by the Italian, the Greek,
      or the Syrian, who ascended the chair of St. Peter; and, after
      the loss of her legions and provinces, the genius and fortune of
      the popes again restored the supremacy of Rome. It is agreed,
      that in the eighth century, their dominion was founded on
      rebellion, and that the rebellion was produced, and justified, by
      the heresy of the Iconoclasts; but the conduct of the second and
      third Gregory, in this memorable contest, is variously
      interpreted by the wishes of their friends and enemies. The
      Byzantine writers unanimously declare, that, after a fruitless
      admonition, they pronounced the separation of the East and West,
      and deprived the sacrilegious tyrant of the revenue and
      sovereignty of Italy. Their excommunication is still more clearly
      expressed by the Greeks, who beheld the accomplishment of the
      papal triumphs; and as they are more strongly attached to their
      religion than to their country, they praise, instead of blaming,
      the zeal and orthodoxy of these apostolical men. 26 The modern
      champions of Rome are eager to accept the praise and the
      precedent: this great and glorious example of the deposition of
      royal heretics is celebrated by the cardinals Baronius and
      Bellarmine; 27 and if they are asked, why the same thunders were
      not hurled against the Neros and Julians of antiquity, they
      reply, that the weakness of the primitive church was the sole
      cause of her patient loyalty. 28 On this occasion the effects of
      love and hatred are the same; and the zealous Protestants, who
      seek to kindle the indignation, and to alarm the fears, of
      princes and magistrates, expatiate on the insolence and treason
      of the two Gregories against their lawful sovereign. 29 They are
      defended only by the moderate Catholics, for the most part, of
      the Gallican church, 30 who respect the saint, without approving
      the sin. These common advocates of the crown and the mitre
      circumscribe the truth of facts by the rule of equity, Scripture,
      and tradition, and appeal to the evidence of the Latins, 31 and
      the lives 32 and epistles of the popes; themselves.

      Chapter XLIX: Conquest Of Italy By The Franks.—Part II.

      Two original epistles, from Gregory the Second to the emperor
      Leo, are still extant; 33 and if they cannot be praised as the
      most perfect models of eloquence and logic, they exhibit the
      portrait, or at least the mask, of the founder of the papal
      monarchy. “During ten pure and fortunate years,” says Gregory to
      the emperor, “we have tasted the annual comfort of your royal
      letters, subscribed in purple ink, with your own hand, the sacred
      pledges of your attachment to the orthodox creed of our fathers.
      How deplorable is the change! how tremendous the scandal! You now
      accuse the Catholics of idolatry; and, by the accusation, you
      betray your own impiety and ignorance. To this ignorance we are
      compelled to adapt the grossness of our style and arguments: the
      first elements of holy letters are sufficient for your confusion;
      and were you to enter a grammar-school, and avow yourself the
      enemy of our worship, the simple and pious children would be
      provoked to cast their horn-books at your head.” After this
      decent salutation, the pope attempts the usual distinction
      between the idols of antiquity and the Christian images. The
      former were the fanciful representations of phantoms or daemons,
      at a time when the true God had not manifested his person in any
      visible likeness. The latter are the genuine forms of Christ, his
      mother, and his saints, who had approved, by a crowd of miracles,
      the innocence and merit of this relative worship. He must indeed
      have trusted to the ignorance of Leo, since he could assert the
      perpetual use of images, from the apostolic age, and their
      venerable presence in the six synods of the Catholic church. A
      more specious argument is drawn from present possession and
      recent practice the harmony of the Christian world supersedes the
      demand of a general council; and Gregory frankly confesses, than
      such assemblies can only be useful under the reign of an orthodox
      prince. To the impudent and inhuman Leo, more guilty than a
      heretic, he recommends peace, silence, and implicit obedience to
      his spiritual guides of Constantinople and Rome. The limits of
      civil and ecclesiastical powers are defined by the pontiff. To
      the former he appropriates the body; to the latter, the soul: the
      sword of justice is in the hands of the magistrate: the more
      formidable weapon of excommunication is intrusted to the clergy;
      and in the exercise of their divine commission a zealous son will
      not spare his offending father: the successor of St. Peter may
      lawfully chastise the kings of the earth. “You assault us, O
      tyrant! with a carnal and military hand: unarmed and naked we can
      only implore the Christ, the prince of the heavenly host, that he
      will send unto you a devil, for the destruction of your body and
      the salvation of your soul. You declare, with foolish arrogance,
      I will despatch my orders to Rome: I will break in pieces the
      image of St. Peter; and Gregory, like his predecessor Martin,
      shall be transported in chains, and in exile, to the foot of the
      Imperial throne. Would to God that I might be permitted to tread
      in the footsteps of the holy Martin! but may the fate of Constans
      serve as a warning to the persecutors of the church! After his
      just condemnation by the bishops of Sicily, the tyrant was cut
      off, in the fullness of his sins, by a domestic servant: the
      saint is still adored by the nations of Scythia, among whom he
      ended his banishment and his life. But it is our duty to live for
      the edification and support of the faithful people; nor are we
      reduced to risk our safety on the event of a combat. Incapable as
      you are of defending your Roman subjects, the maritime situation
      of the city may perhaps expose it to your depredation but we can
      remove to the distance of four-and-twenty stadia, to the first
      fortress of the Lombards, and then—you may pursue the winds. 34
      Are you ignorant that the popes are the bond of union, the
      mediators of peace, between the East and West? The eyes of the
      nations are fixed on our humility; and they revere, as a God upon
      earth, the apostle St. Peter, whose image you threaten to
      destroy. 35 The remote and interior kingdoms of the West present
      their homage to Christ and his vicegerent; and we now prepare to
      visit one of their most powerful monarchs, who desires to receive
      from our hands the sacrament of baptism. 36 The Barbarians have
      submitted to the yoke of the gospel, while you alone are deaf to
      the voice of the shepherd. These pious Barbarians are kindled
      into rage: they thirst to avenge the persecution of the East.
      Abandon your rash and fatal enterprise; reflect, tremble, and
      repent. If you persist, we are innocent of the blood that will be
      spilt in the contest; may it fall on your own head!”

      reckons the xxivth stadia, not from Rome, but from the limits of
      the Roman duchy, to the first fortress, perhaps Sora, of the
      Lombards. I rather believe that Gregory, with the pedantry of the
      age, employs stadia for miles, without much inquiry into the
      genuine measure.]

      36 (return) [ (p. 665.) The pope appears to have imposed on the
      ignorance of the Greeks: he lived and died in the Lateran; and in
      his time all the kingdoms of the West had embraced Christianity.
      May not this unknown Septetus have some reference to the chief of
      the Saxon Heptarchy, to Ina king of Wessex, who, in the
      pontificate of Gregory the Second, visited Rome for the purpose,
      not of baptism, but of pilgrimage! (Pagi. A., 89, No. 2. A.D.
      726, No. 15.)]

      The first assault of Leo against the images of Constantinople had
      been witnessed by a crowd of strangers from Italy and the West,
      who related with grief and indignation the sacrilege of the
      emperor. But on the reception of his proscriptive edict, they
      trembled for their domestic deities: the images of Christ and the
      Virgin, of the angels, martyrs, and saints, were abolished in all
      the churches of Italy; and a strong alternative was proposed to
      the Roman pontiff, the royal favor as the price of his
      compliance, degradation and exile as the penalty of his
      disobedience. Neither zeal nor policy allowed him to hesitate;
      and the haughty strain in which Gregory addressed the emperor
      displays his confidence in the truth of his doctrine or the
      powers of resistance. Without depending on prayers or miracles,
      he boldly armed against the public enemy, and his pastoral
      letters admonished the Italians of their danger and their duty.
      37 At this signal, Ravenna, Venice, and the cities of the
      Exarchate and Pentapolis, adhered to the cause of religion; their
      military force by sea and land consisted, for the most part, of
      the natives; and the spirit of patriotism and zeal was transfused
      into the mercenary strangers. The Italians swore to live and die
      in the defence of the pope and the holy images; the Roman people
      was devoted to their father, and even the Lombards were ambitious
      to share the merit and advantage of this holy war. The most
      treasonable act, but the most obvious revenge, was the
      destruction of the statues of Leo himself: the most effectual and
      pleasing measure of rebellion, was the withholding the tribute of
      Italy, and depriving him of a power which he had recently abused
      by the imposition of a new capitation. 38 A form of
      administration was preserved by the election of magistrates and
      governors; and so high was the public indignation, that the
      Italians were prepared to create an orthodox emperor, and to
      conduct him with a fleet and army to the palace of
      Constantinople. In that palace, the Roman bishops, the second and
      third Gregory, were condemned as the authors of the revolt, and
      every attempt was made, either by fraud or force, to seize their
      persons, and to strike at their lives. The city was repeatedly
      visited or assaulted by captains of the guards, and dukes and
      exarchs of high dignity or secret trust; they landed with foreign
      troops, they obtained some domestic aid, and the superstition of
      Naples may blush that her fathers were attached to the cause of
      heresy. But these clandestine or open attacks were repelled by
      the courage and vigilance of the Romans; the Greeks were
      overthrown and massacred, their leaders suffered an ignominious
      death, and the popes, however inclined to mercy, refused to
      intercede for these guilty victims. At Ravenna, 39 the several
      quarters of the city had long exercised a bloody and hereditary
      feud; in religious controversy they found a new aliment of
      faction: but the votaries of images were superior in numbers or
      spirit, and the exarch, who attempted to stem the torrent, lost
      his life in a popular sedition. To punish this flagitious deed,
      and restore his dominion in Italy, the emperor sent a fleet and
      army into the Adriatic Gulf. After suffering from the winds and
      waves much loss and delay, the Greeks made their descent in the
      neighborhood of Ravenna: they threatened to depopulate the guilty
      capital, and to imitate, perhaps to surpass, the example of
      Justinian the Second, who had chastised a former rebellion by the
      choice and execution of fifty of the principal inhabitants. The
      women and clergy, in sackcloth and ashes, lay prostrate in
      prayer: the men were in arms for the defence of their country;
      the common danger had united the factions, and the event of a
      battle was preferred to the slow miseries of a siege. In a
      hard-fought day, as the two armies alternately yielded and
      advanced, a phantom was seen, a voice was heard, and Ravenna was
      victorious by the assurance of victory. The strangers retreated
      to their ships, but the populous sea-coast poured forth a
      multitude of boats; the waters of the Po were so deeply infected
      with blood, that during six years the public prejudice abstained
      from the fish of the river; and the institution of an annual
      feast perpetuated the worship of images, and the abhorrence of
      the Greek tyrant. Amidst the triumph of the Catholic arms, the
      Roman pontiff convened a synod of ninety-three bishops against
      the heresy of the Iconoclasts. With their consent, he pronounced
      a general excommunication against all who by word or deed should
      attack the tradition of the fathers and the images of the saints:
      in this sentence the emperor was tacitly involved, 40 but the
      vote of a last and hopeless remonstrance may seem to imply that
      the anathema was yet suspended over his guilty head. No sooner
      had they confirmed their own safety, the worship of images, and
      the freedom of Rome and Italy, than the popes appear to have
      relaxed of their severity, and to have spared the relics of the
      Byzantine dominion. Their moderate councils delayed and prevented
      the election of a new emperor, and they exhorted the Italians not
      to separate from the body of the Roman monarchy. The exarch was
      permitted to reside within the walls of Ravenna, a captive rather
      than a master; and till the Imperial coronation of Charlemagne,
      the government of Rome and Italy was exercised in the name of the
      successors of Constantine. 41

      The liberty of Rome, which had been oppressed by the arms and
      arts of Augustus, was rescued, after seven hundred and fifty
      years of servitude, from the persecution of Leo the Isaurian. By
      the Caesars, the triumphs of the consuls had been annihilated: in
      the decline and fall of the empire, the god Terminus, the sacred
      boundary, had insensibly receded from the ocean, the Rhine, the
      Danube, and the Euphrates; and Rome was reduced to her ancient
      territory from Viterbo to Terracina, and from Narni to the mouth
      of the Tyber. 42 When the kings were banished, the republic
      reposed on the firm basis which had been founded by their wisdom
      and virtue. Their perpetual jurisdiction was divided between two
      annual magistrates: the senate continued to exercise the powers
      of administration and counsel; and the legislative authority was
      distributed in the assemblies of the people, by a
      well-proportioned scale of property and service. Ignorant of the
      arts of luxury, the primitive Romans had improved the science of
      government and war: the will of the community was absolute: the
      rights of individuals were sacred: one hundred and thirty
      thousand citizens were armed for defence or conquest; and a band
      of robbers and outlaws was moulded into a nation deserving of
      freedom and ambitious of glory. 43 When the sovereignty of the
      Greek emperors was extinguished, the ruins of Rome presented the
      sad image of depopulation and decay: her slavery was a habit, her
      liberty an accident; the effect of superstition, and the object
      of her own amazement and terror. The last vestige of the
      substance, or even the forms, of the constitution, was
      obliterated from the practice and memory of the Romans; and they
      were devoid of knowledge, or virtue, again to build the fabric of
      a commonwealth. Their scanty remnant, the offspring of slaves and
      strangers, was despicable in the eyes of the victorious
      Barbarians. As often as the Franks or Lombards expressed their
      most bitter contempt of a foe, they called him a Roman; “and in
      this name,” says the bishop Liutprand, “we include whatever is
      base, whatever is cowardly, whatever is perfidious, the extremes
      of avarice and luxury, and every vice that can prostitute the
      dignity of human nature.” 44 441 By the necessity of their
      situation, the inhabitants of Rome were cast into the rough model
      of a republican government: they were compelled to elect some
      judges in peace, and some leaders in war: the nobles assembled to
      deliberate, and their resolves could not be executed without the
      union and consent of the multitude. The style of the Roman senate
      and people was revived, 45 but the spirit was fled; and their new
      independence was disgraced by the tumultuous conflict of
      vicentiousness and oppression. The want of laws could only be
      supplied by the influence of religion, and their foreign and
      domestic counsels were moderated by the authority of the bishop.
      His alms, his sermons, his correspondence with the kings and
      prelates of the West, his recent services, their gratitude, and
      oath, accustomed the Romans to consider him as the first
      magistrate or prince of the city. The Christian humility of the
      popes was not offended by the name of Dominus, or Lord; and their
      face and inscription are still apparent on the most ancient
      coins. 46 Their temporal dominion is now confirmed by the
      reverence of a thousand years; and their noblest title is the
      free choice of a people, whom they had redeemed from slavery.

      In the quarrels of ancient Greece, the holy people of Elis
      enjoyed a perpetual peace, under the protection of Jupiter, and
      in the exercise of the Olympic games. 47 Happy would it have been
      for the Romans, if a similar privilege had guarded the patrimony
      of St. Peter from the calamities of war; if the Christians, who
      visited the holy threshold, would have sheathed their swords in
      the presence of the apostle and his successor. But this mystic
      circle could have been traced only by the wand of a legislator
      and a sage: this pacific system was incompatible with the zeal
      and ambition of the popes; the Romans were not addicted, like the
      inhabitants of Elis, to the innocent and placid labors of
      agriculture; and the Barbarians of Italy, though softened by the
      climate, were far below the Grecian states in the institutions of
      public and private life. A memorable example of repentance and
      piety was exhibited by Liutprand, king of the Lombards. In arms,
      at the gate of the Vatican, the conqueror listened to the voice
      of Gregory the Second, 48 withdrew his troops, resigned his
      conquests, respectfully visited the church of St. Peter, and
      after performing his devotions, offered his sword and dagger, his
      cuirass and mantle, his silver cross, and his crown of gold, on
      the tomb of the apostle. But this religious fervor was the
      illusion, perhaps the artifice, of the moment; the sense of
      interest is strong and lasting; the love of arms and rapine was
      congenial to the Lombards; and both the prince and people were
      irresistibly tempted by the disorders of Italy, the nakedness of
      Rome, and the unwarlike profession of her new chief. On the first
      edicts of the emperor, they declared themselves the champions of
      the holy images: Liutprand invaded the province of Romagna, which
      had already assumed that distinctive appellation; the Catholics
      of the Exarchate yielded without reluctance to his civil and
      military power; and a foreign enemy was introduced for the first
      time into the impregnable fortress of Ravenna. That city and
      fortress were speedily recovered by the active diligence and
      maritime forces of the Venetians; and those faithful subjects
      obeyed the exhortation of Gregory himself, in separating the
      personal guilt of Leo from the general cause of the Roman empire.
      49 The Greeks were less mindful of the service, than the Lombards
      of the injury: the two nations, hostile in their faith, were
      reconciled in a dangerous and unnatural alliance: the king and
      the exarch marched to the conquest of Spoleto and Rome: the storm
      evaporated without effect, but the policy of Liutprand alarmed
      Italy with a vexatious alternative of hostility and truce. His
      successor Astolphus declared himself the equal enemy of the
      emperor and the pope: Ravenna was subdued by force or treachery,
      50 and this final conquest extinguished the series of the
      exarchs, who had reigned with a subordinate power since the time
      of Justinian and the ruin of the Gothic kingdom. Rome was
      summoned to acknowledge the victorious Lombard as her lawful
      sovereign; the annual tribute of a piece of gold was fixed as the
      ransom of each citizen, and the sword of destruction was
      unsheathed to exact the penalty of her disobedience. The Romans
      hesitated; they entreated; they complained; and the threatening
      Barbarians were checked by arms and negotiations, till the popes
      had engaged the friendship of an ally and avenger beyond the
      Alps. 51

      Ms. (Bibliothecae Cubicularis) is now in the Imperial library of
      Vienna, and has been published by Lambecius and Muratori,
      (Script. Rerum Ital. tom. iii. pars ii. p. 75, &c.)]

      In his distress, the first 511 Gregory had implored the aid of
      the hero of the age, of Charles Martel, who governed the French
      monarchy with the humble title of mayor or duke; and who, by his
      signal victory over the Saracens, had saved his country, and
      perhaps Europe, from the Mahometan yoke. The ambassadors of the
      pope were received by Charles with decent reverence; but the
      greatness of his occupations, and the shortness of his life,
      prevented his interference in the affairs of Italy, except by a
      friendly and ineffectual mediation. His son Pepin, the heir of
      his power and virtues, assumed the office of champion of the
      Roman church; and the zeal of the French prince appears to have
      been prompted by the love of glory and religion. But the danger
      was on the banks of the Tyber, the succor on those of the Seine,
      and our sympathy is cold to the relation of distant misery.
      Amidst the tears of the city, Stephen the Third embraced the
      generous resolution of visiting in person the courts of Lombardy
      and France, to deprecate the injustice of his enemy, or to excite
      the pity and indignation of his friend. After soothing the public
      despair by litanies and orations, he undertook this laborious
      journey with the ambassadors of the French monarch and the Greek
      emperor. The king of the Lombards was inexorable; but his threats
      could not silence the complaints, nor retard the speed of the
      Roman pontiff, who traversed the Pennine Alps, reposed in the
      abbey of St. Maurice, and hastened to grasp the right hand of his
      protector; a hand which was never lifted in vain, either in war
      or friendship. Stephen was entertained as the visible successor
      of the apostle; at the next assembly, the field of March or of
      May, his injuries were exposed to a devout and warlike nation,
      and he repassed the Alps, not as a suppliant, but as a conqueror,
      at the head of a French army, which was led by the king in
      person. The Lombards, after a weak resistance, obtained an
      ignominious peace, and swore to restore the possessions, and to
      respect the sanctity, of the Roman church. But no sooner was
      Astolphus delivered from the presence of the French arms, than he
      forgot his promise and resented his disgrace. Rome was again
      encompassed by his arms; and Stephen, apprehensive of fatiguing
      the zeal of his Transalpine allies enforced his complaint and
      request by an eloquent letter in the name and person of St. Peter
      himself. 52 The apostle assures his adopted sons, the king, the
      clergy, and the nobles of France, that, dead in the flesh, he is
      still alive in the spirit; that they now hear, and must obey, the
      voice of the founder and guardian of the Roman church; that the
      Virgin, the angels, the saints, and the martyrs, and all the host
      of heaven, unanimously urge the request, and will confess the
      obligation; that riches, victory, and paradise, will crown their
      pious enterprise, and that eternal damnation will be the penalty
      of their neglect, if they suffer his tomb, his temple, and his
      people, to fall into the hands of the perfidious Lombards. The
      second expedition of Pepin was not less rapid and fortunate than
      the first: St. Peter was satisfied, Rome was again saved, and
      Astolphus was taught the lessons of justice and sincerity by the
      scourge of a foreign master. After this double chastisement, the
      Lombards languished about twenty years in a state of languor and
      decay. But their minds were not yet humbled to their condition;
      and instead of affecting the pacific virtues of the feeble, they
      peevishly harassed the Romans with a repetition of claims,
      evasions, and inroads, which they undertook without reflection,
      and terminated without glory. On either side, their expiring
      monarchy was pressed by the zeal and prudence of Pope Adrian the
      First, the genius, the fortune, and greatness of Charlemagne, the
      son of Pepin; these heroes of the church and state were united in
      public and domestic friendship, and while they trampled on the
      prostrate, they varnished their proceedings with the fairest
      colors of equity and moderation. 53 The passes of the Alps, and
      the walls of Pavia, were the only defence of the Lombards; the
      former were surprised, the latter were invested, by the son of
      Pepin; and after a blockade of two years, 531 Desiderius, the
      last of their native princes, surrendered his sceptre and his
      capital.

      Under the dominion of a foreign king, but in the possession of
      their national laws, the Lombards became the brethren, rather
      than the subjects, of the Franks; who derived their blood, and
      manners, and language, from the same Germanic origin. 54

      Chapter XLIX: Conquest Of Italy By The Franks.—Part III.

      The mutual obligations of the popes and the Carlovingian family
      form the important link of ancient and modern, of civil and
      ecclesiastical, history. In the conquest of Italy, the champions
      of the Roman church obtained a favorable occasion, a specious
      title, the wishes of the people, the prayers and intrigues of the
      clergy. But the most essential gifts of the popes to the
      Carlovingian race were the dignities of king of France, 55 and of
      patrician of Rome. I. Under the sacerdotal monarchy of St. Peter,
      the nations began to resume the practice of seeking, on the banks
      of the Tyber, their kings, their laws, and the oracles of their
      fate. The Franks were perplexed between the name and substance of
      their government. All the powers of royalty were exercised by
      Pepin, mayor of the palace; and nothing, except the regal title,
      was wanting to his ambition. His enemies were crushed by his
      valor; his friends were multiplied by his liberality; his father
      had been the savior of Christendom; and the claims of personal
      merit were repeated and ennobled in a descent of four
      generations. The name and image of royalty was still preserved in
      the last descendant of Clovis, the feeble Childeric; but his
      obsolete right could only be used as an instrument of sedition:
      the nation was desirous of restoring the simplicity of the
      constitution; and Pepin, a subject and a prince, was ambitious to
      ascertain his own rank and the fortune of his family. The mayor
      and the nobles were bound, by an oath of fidelity, to the royal
      phantom: the blood of Clovis was pure and sacred in their eyes;
      and their common ambassadors addressed the Roman pontiff, to
      dispel their scruples, or to absolve their promise. The interest
      of Pope Zachary, the successor of the two Gregories, prompted him
      to decide, and to decide in their favor: he pronounced that the
      nation might lawfully unite in the same person the title and
      authority of king; and that the unfortunate Childeric, a victim
      of the public safety, should be degraded, shaved, and confined in
      a monastery for the remainder of his days. An answer so agreeable
      to their wishes was accepted by the Franks as the opinion of a
      casuist, the sentence of a judge, or the oracle of a prophet: the
      Merovingian race disappeared from the earth; and Pepin was
      exalted on a buckler by the suffrage of a free people, accustomed
      to obey his laws and to march under his standard. His coronation
      was twice performed, with the sanction of the popes, by their
      most faithful servant St. Boniface, the apostle of Germany, and
      by the grateful hands of Stephen the Third, who, in the monastery
      of St. Denys placed the diadem on the head of his benefactor. The
      royal unction of the kings of Israel was dexterously applied: 56
      the successor of St. Peter assumed the character of a divine
      ambassador: a German chieftain was transformed into the Lord’s
      anointed; and this Jewish rite has been diffused and maintained
      by the superstition and vanity of modern Europe. The Franks were
      absolved from their ancient oath; but a dire anathema was
      thundered against them and their posterity, if they should dare
      to renew the same freedom of choice, or to elect a king, except
      in the holy and meritorious race of the Carlovingian princes.
      Without apprehending the future danger, these princes gloried in
      their present security: the secretary of Charlemagne affirms,
      that the French sceptre was transferred by the authority of the
      popes; 57 and in their boldest enterprises, they insist, with
      confidence, on this signal and successful act of temporal
      jurisdiction.

      II. In the change of manners and language the patricians of Rome
      58 were far removed from the senate of Romulus, or the palace of
      Constantine, from the free nobles of the republic, or the
      fictitious parents of the emperor. After the recovery of Italy
      and Africa by the arms of Justinian, the importance and danger of
      those remote provinces required the presence of a supreme
      magistrate; he was indifferently styled the exarch or the
      patrician; and these governors of Ravenna, who fill their place
      in the chronology of princes, extended their jurisdiction over
      the Roman city. Since the revolt of Italy and the loss of the
      Exarchate, the distress of the Romans had exacted some sacrifice
      of their independence. Yet, even in this act, they exercised the
      right of disposing of themselves; and the decrees of the senate
      and people successively invested Charles Martel and his posterity
      with the honors of patrician of Rome. The leaders of a powerful
      nation would have disdained a servile title and subordinate
      office; but the reign of the Greek emperors was suspended; and,
      in the vacancy of the empire, they derived a more glorious
      commission from the pope and the republic. The Roman ambassadors
      presented these patricians with the keys of the shrine of St.
      Peter, as a pledge and symbol of sovereignty; with a holy banner
      which it was their right and duty to unfurl in the defence of the
      church and city. 59 In the time of Charles Martel and of Pepin,
      the interposition of the Lombard kingdom covered the freedom,
      while it threatened the safety, of Rome; and the patriciate
      represented only the title, the service, the alliance, of these
      distant protectors. The power and policy of Charlemagne
      annihilated an enemy, and imposed a master. In his first visit to
      the capital, he was received with all the honors which had
      formerly been paid to the exarch, the representative of the
      emperor; and these honors obtained some new decorations from the
      joy and gratitude of Pope Adrian the First. 60 No sooner was he
      informed of the sudden approach of the monarch, than he
      despatched the magistrates and nobles of Rome to meet him, with
      the banner, about thirty miles from the city. At the distance of
      one mile, the Flaminian way was lined with the schools, or
      national communities, of Greeks, Lombards, Saxons, &c.: the Roman
      youth were under arms; and the children of a more tender age,
      with palms and olive branches in their hands, chanted the praises
      of their great deliverer. At the aspect of the holy crosses, and
      ensigns of the saints, he dismounted from his horse, led the
      procession of his nobles to the Vatican, and, as he ascended the
      stairs, devoutly kissed each step of the threshold of the
      apostles. In the portico, Adrian expected him at the head of his
      clergy: they embraced, as friends and equals; but in their march
      to the altar, the king or patrician assumed the right hand of the
      pope. Nor was the Frank content with these vain and empty
      demonstrations of respect. In the twenty-six years that elapsed
      between the conquest of Lombardy and his Imperial coronation,
      Rome, which had been delivered by the sword, was subject, as his
      own, to the sceptre of Charlemagne. The people swore allegiance
      to his person and family: in his name money was coined, and
      justice was administered; and the election of the popes was
      examined and confirmed by his authority. Except an original and
      self-inherent claim of sovereignty, there was not any prerogative
      remaining, which the title of emperor could add to the patrician
      of Rome. 61

      empire.]

      76,) seems to allow of no palliation or escape. In the Ms. of the
      Vienna library, they read, instead of regnum, rogum, prayer or
      request (see Ducange;) and the royalty of Charles Martel is
      subverted by this important correction, (Catalani, in his
      Critical Prefaces, Annali d’Italia, tom. xvii. p. 95-99.)]

      patricium suscipiendum, sum cum ingenti honore suscipi fecit,
      (tom. iii. pars i. p. 185.)]

      61 (return) [ Paulus Diaconus, who wrote before the empire of
      Charlemagne describes Rome as his subject city—vestrae civitates
      (ad Pompeium Festum) suis addidit sceptris, (de Metensis
      Ecclesiae Episcopis.) Some Carlovingian medals, struck at Rome,
      have engaged Le Blanc to write an elaborate, though partial,
      dissertation on their authority at Rome, both as patricians and
      emperors, (Amsterdam, 1692, in 4to.)]

      The gratitude of the Carlovingians was adequate to these
      obligations, and their names are consecrated, as the saviors and
      benefactors of the Roman church. Her ancient patrimony of farms
      and houses was transformed by their bounty into the temporal
      dominion of cities and provinces; and the donation of the
      Exarchate was the first-fruits of the conquests of Pepin. 62
      Astolphus with a sigh relinquished his prey; the keys and the
      hostages of the principal cities were delivered to the French
      ambassador; and, in his master’s name, he presented them before
      the tomb of St. Peter. The ample measure of the Exarchate 63
      might comprise all the provinces of Italy which had obeyed the
      emperor and his vicegerent; but its strict and proper limits were
      included in the territories of Ravenna, Bologna, and Ferrara: its
      inseparable dependency was the Pentapolis, which stretched along
      the Adriatic from Rimini to Ancona, and advanced into the
      midland-country as far as the ridges of the Apennine. In this
      transaction, the ambition and avarice of the popes have been
      severely condemned. Perhaps the humility of a Christian priest
      should have rejected an earthly kingdom, which it was not easy
      for him to govern without renouncing the virtues of his
      profession. Perhaps a faithful subject, or even a generous enemy,
      would have been less impatient to divide the spoils of the
      Barbarian; and if the emperor had intrusted Stephen to solicit in
      his name the restitution of the Exarchate, I will not absolve the
      pope from the reproach of treachery and falsehood. But in the
      rigid interpretation of the laws, every one may accept, without
      injury, whatever his benefactor can bestow without injustice. The
      Greek emperor had abdicated, or forfeited, his right to the
      Exarchate; and the sword of Astolphus was broken by the stronger
      sword of the Carlovingian. It was not in the cause of the
      Iconoclast that Pepin has exposed his person and army in a double
      expedition beyond the Alps: he possessed, and might lawfully
      alienate, his conquests: and to the importunities of the Greeks
      he piously replied that no human consideration should tempt him
      to resume the gift which he had conferred on the Roman Pontiff
      for the remission of his sins, and the salvation of his soul. The
      splendid donation was granted in supreme and absolute dominion,
      and the world beheld for the first time a Christian bishop
      invested with the prerogatives of a temporal prince; the choice
      of magistrates, the exercise of justice, the imposition of taxes,
      and the wealth of the palace of Ravenna. In the dissolution of
      the Lombard kingdom, the inhabitants of the duchy of Spoleto 64
      sought a refuge from the storm, shaved their heads after the
      Roman fashion, declared themselves the servants and subjects of
      St. Peter, and completed, by this voluntary surrender, the
      present circle of the ecclesiastical state. That mysterious
      circle was enlarged to an indefinite extent, by the verbal or
      written donation of Charlemagne, 65 who, in the first transports
      of his victory, despoiled himself and the Greek emperor of the
      cities and islands which had formerly been annexed to the
      Exarchate. But, in the cooler moments of absence and reflection,
      he viewed, with an eye of jealousy and envy, the recent greatness
      of his ecclesiastical ally. The execution of his own and his
      father’s promises was respectfully eluded: the king of the Franks
      and Lombards asserted the inalienable rights of the empire; and,
      in his life and death, Ravenna, 66 as well as Rome, was numbered
      in the list of his metropolitan cities. The sovereignty of the
      Exarchate melted away in the hands of the popes; they found in
      the archbishops of Ravenna a dangerous and domestic rival: 67 the
      nobles and people disdained the yoke of a priest; and in the
      disorders of the times, they could only retain the memory of an
      ancient claim, which, in a more prosperous age, they have revived
      and realized.

      62 (return) [ Mosheim (Institution, Hist. Eccles. p. 263) weighs
      this donation with fair and deliberate prudence. The original act
      has never been produced; but the Liber Pontificalis represents,
      (p. 171,) and the Codex Carolinus supposes, this ample gift. Both
      are contemporary records and the latter is the more authentic,
      since it has been preserved, not in the Papal, but the Imperial,
      library.]

      concessions, of interest and prejudice, from which even Muratori

      they were only verbal. The most ancient act of donation that
      pretends to be extant, is that of the emperor Lewis the Pious,
      (Sigonius, de Regno Italiae, l. iv. Opera, tom. ii. p. 267-270.)
      Its authenticity, or at least its integrity, are much questioned,
      (Pagi, A.D. 817, No. 7, &c. Muratori, Annali, tom. vi. p. 432,
      &c. Dissertat. Chorographica, p. 33, 34;) but I see no reasonable
      objection to these princes so freely disposing of what was not
      their own.]

      66 (return) [ Charlemagne solicited and obtained from the
      proprietor, Hadrian I., the mosaics of the palace of Ravenna, for

      of Ravenna, (Codex Carolin, epist. 51, 52, 53, p. 200-205.) Sir

      nequaquam nos Romani pontifices sic subjugassent, (Agnellus,
      Liber Pontificalis, in Scriptores Rerum Ital. tom. ii. pars. i.
      p. 107.)]

      Fraud is the resource of weakness and cunning; and the strong,
      though ignorant, Barbarian was often entangled in the net of
      sacerdotal policy. The Vatican and Lateran were an arsenal and
      manufacture, which, according to the occasion, have produced or
      concealed a various collection of false or genuine, of corrupt or
      suspicious, acts, as they tended to promote the interest of the
      Roman church. Before the end of the eighth century, some
      apostolic scribe, perhaps the notorious Isidore, composed the
      decretals, and the donation of Constantine, the two magic pillars
      of the spiritual and temporal monarchy of the popes. This
      memorable donation was introduced to the world by an epistle of
      Adrian the First, who exhorts Charlemagne to imitate the
      liberality, and revive the name, of the great Constantine. 68
      According to the legend, the first of the Christian emperors was
      healed of the leprosy, and purified in the waters of baptism, by
      St. Silvester, the Roman bishop; and never was physician more
      gloriously recompensed. His royal proselyte withdrew from the
      seat and patrimony of St. Peter; declared his resolution of
      founding a new capital in the East; and resigned to the popes;
      the free and perpetual sovereignty of Rome, Italy, and the
      provinces of the West. 69 This fiction was productive of the most
      beneficial effects. The Greek princes were convicted of the guilt
      of usurpation; and the revolt of Gregory was the claim of his
      lawful inheritance. The popes were delivered from their debt of
      gratitude; and the nominal gifts of the Carlovingians were no
      more than the just and irrevocable restitution of a scanty
      portion of the ecclesiastical state. The sovereignty of Rome no
      longer depended on the choice of a fickle people; and the
      successors of St. Peter and Constantine were invested with the
      purple and prerogatives of the Caesars. So deep was the ignorance
      and credulity of the times, that the most absurd of fables was
      received, with equal reverence, in Greece and in France, and is
      still enrolled among the decrees of the canon law. 70 The
      emperors, and the Romans, were incapable of discerning a forgery,
      that subverted their rights and freedom; and the only opposition
      proceeded from a Sabine monastery, which, in the beginning of the
      twelfth century, disputed the truth and validity of the donation
      of Constantine. 71 In the revival of letters and liberty, this
      fictitious deed was transpierced by the pen of Laurentius Valla,
      the pen of an eloquent critic and a Roman patriot. 72 His
      contemporaries of the fifteenth century were astonished at his
      sacrilegious boldness; yet such is the silent and irresistible
      progress of reason, that, before the end of the next age, the
      fable was rejected by the contempt of historians 73 and poets, 74
      and the tacit or modest censure of the advocates of the Roman
      church. 75 The popes themselves have indulged a smile at the
      credulity of the vulgar; 76 but a false and obsolete title still
      sanctifies their reign; and, by the same fortune which has
      attended the decretals and the Sibylline oracles, the edifice has
      subsisted after the foundations have been undermined.

      While the popes established in Italy their freedom and dominion,
      the images, the first cause of their revolt, were restored in the
      Eastern empire. 77 Under the reign of Constantine the Fifth, the
      union of civil and ecclesiastical power had overthrown the tree,
      without extirpating the root, of superstition. The idols (for
      such they were now held) were secretly cherished by the order and
      the sex most prone to devotion; and the fond alliance of the
      monks and females obtained a final victory over the reason and
      authority of man. Leo the Fourth maintained with less rigor the
      religion of his father and grandfather; but his wife, the fair
      and ambitious Irene, had imbibed the zeal of the Athenians, the
      heirs of the Idolatry, rather than the philosophy, of their
      ancestors. During the life of her husband, these sentiments were
      inflamed by danger and dissimulation, and she could only labor to
      protect and promote some favorite monks whom she drew from their
      caverns, and seated on the metropolitan thrones of the East. But
      as soon as she reigned in her own name and that of her son, Irene
      more seriously undertook the ruin of the Iconoclasts; and the
      first step of her future persecution was a general edict for
      liberty of conscience.

      In the restoration of the monks, a thousand images were exposed
      to the public veneration; a thousand legends were inverted of
      their sufferings and miracles. By the opportunities of death or
      removal, the episcopal seats were judiciously filled; the most
      eager competitors for earthly or celestial favor anticipated and
      flattered the judgment of their sovereign; and the promotion of
      her secretary Tarasius gave Irene the patriarch of
      Constantinople, and the command of the Oriental church. But the
      decrees of a general council could only be repealed by a similar
      assembly: 78 the Iconoclasts whom she convened were bold in
      possession, and averse to debate; and the feeble voice of the
      bishops was reechoed by the more formidable clamor of the
      soldiers and people of Constantinople. The delay and intrigues of
      a year, the separation of the disaffected troops, and the choice
      of Nice for a second orthodox synod, removed these obstacles; and
      the episcopal conscience was again, after the Greek fashion, in
      the hands of the prince. No more than eighteen days were allowed
      for the consummation of this important work: the Iconoclasts
      appeared, not as judges, but as criminals or penitents: the scene
      was decorated by the legates of Pope Adrian and the Eastern
      patriarchs, 79 the decrees were framed by the president Taracius,
      and ratified by the acclamations and subscriptions of three
      hundred and fifty bishops. They unanimously pronounced, that the
      worship of images is agreeable to Scripture and reason, to the
      fathers and councils of the church: but they hesitate whether
      that worship be relative or direct; whether the Godhead, and the
      figure of Christ, be entitled to the same mode of adoration. Of
      this second Nicene council the acts are still extant; a curious
      monument of superstition and ignorance, of falsehood and folly. I
      shall only notice the judgment of the bishops on the comparative
      merit of image-worship and morality. A monk had concluded a truce
      with the daemon of fornication, on condition of interrupting his
      daily prayers to a picture that hung in his cell. His scruples
      prompted him to consult the abbot. “Rather than abstain from
      adoring Christ and his Mother in their holy images, it would be
      better for you,” replied the casuist, “to enter every brothel,
      and visit every prostitute, in the city.” 80 For the honor of
      orthodoxy, at least the orthodoxy of the Roman church, it is
      somewhat unfortunate, that the two princes who convened the two
      councils of Nice are both stained with the blood of their sons.
      The second of these assemblies was approved and rigorously
      executed by the despotism of Irene, and she refused her
      adversaries the toleration which at first she had granted to her
      friends. During the five succeeding reigns, a period of
      thirty-eight years, the contest was maintained, with unabated
      rage and various success, between the worshippers and the
      breakers of the images; but I am not inclined to pursue with
      minute diligence the repetition of the same events. Nicephorus
      allowed a general liberty of speech and practice; and the only
      virtue of his reign is accused by the monks as the cause of his
      temporal and eternal perdition. Superstition and weakness formed
      the character of Michael the First, but the saints and images
      were incapable of supporting their votary on the throne. In the
      purple, Leo the Fifth asserted the name and religion of an
      Armenian; and the idols, with their seditious adherents, were
      condemned to a second exile. Their applause would have sanctified
      the murder of an impious tyrant, but his assassin and successor,
      the second Michael, was tainted from his birth with the Phrygian
      heresies: he attempted to mediate between the contending parties;
      and the intractable spirit of the Catholics insensibly cast him
      into the opposite scale. His moderation was guarded by timidity;
      but his son Theophilus, alike ignorant of fear and pity, was the
      last and most cruel of the Iconoclasts. The enthusiasm of the
      times ran strongly against them; and the emperors who stemmed the
      torrent were exasperated and punished by the public hatred. After
      the death of Theophilus, the final victory of the images was
      achieved by a second female, his widow Theodora, whom he left the
      guardian of the empire. Her measures were bold and decisive. The
      fiction of a tardy repentance absolved the fame and the soul of
      her deceased husband; the sentence of the Iconoclast patriarch
      was commuted from the loss of his eyes to a whipping of two
      hundred lashes: the bishops trembled, the monks shouted, and the
      festival of orthodoxy preserves the annual memory of the triumph
      of the images. A single question yet remained, whether they are
      endowed with any proper and inherent sanctity; it was agitated by
      the Greeks of the eleventh century; 81 and as this opinion has
      the strongest recommendation of absurdity, I am surprised that it
      was not more explicitly decided in the affirmative. In the West,
      Pope Adrian the First accepted and announced the decrees of the
      Nicene assembly, which is now revered by the Catholics as the
      seventh in rank of the general councils. Rome and Italy were
      docile to the voice of their father; but the greatest part of the
      Latin Christians were far behind in the race of superstition. The
      churches of France, Germany, England, and Spain, steered a middle
      course between the adoration and the destruction of images, which
      they admitted into their temples, not as objects of worship, but
      as lively and useful memorials of faith and history. An angry
      book of controversy was composed and published in the name of
      Charlemagne: 82 under his authority a synod of three hundred
      bishops was assembled at Frankfort: 83 they blamed the fury of
      the Iconoclasts, but they pronounced a more severe censure
      against the superstition of the Greeks, and the decrees of their
      pretended council, which was long despised by the Barbarians of
      the West. 84 Among them the worship of images advanced with a
      silent and insensible progress; but a large atonement is made for
      their hesitation and delay, by the gross idolatry of the ages
      which precede the reformation, and of the countries, both in
      Europe and America, which are still immersed in the gloom of
      superstition.

      Chapter XLIX: Conquest Of Italy By The Franks.—Part IV.

      It was after the Nycene synod, and under the reign of the pious
      Irene, that the popes consummated the separation of Rome and
      Italy, by the translation of the empire to the less orthodox
      Charlemagne. They were compelled to choose between the rival
      nations: religion was not the sole motive of their choice; and
      while they dissembled the failings of their friends, they beheld,
      with reluctance and suspicion, the Catholic virtues of their
      foes. The difference of language and manners had perpetuated the
      enmity of the two capitals; and they were alienated from each
      other by the hostile opposition of seventy years. In that schism
      the Romans had tasted of freedom, and the popes of sovereignty:
      their submission would have exposed them to the revenge of a
      jealous tyrant; and the revolution of Italy had betrayed the
      impotence, as well as the tyranny, of the Byzantine court. The
      Greek emperors had restored the images, but they had not restored
      the Calabrian estates 85 and the Illyrian diocese, 86 which the
      Iconociasts had torn away from the successors of St. Peter; and
      Pope Adrian threatens them with a sentence of excommunication
      unless they speedily abjure this practical heresy. 87 The Greeks
      were now orthodox; but their religion might be tainted by the
      breath of the reigning monarch: the Franks were now contumacious;
      but a discerning eye might discern their approaching conversion,
      from the use, to the adoration, of images. The name of
      Charlemagne was stained by the polemic acrimony of his scribes;
      but the conqueror himself conformed, with the temper of a
      statesman, to the various practice of France and Italy. In his
      four pilgrimages or visits to the Vatican, he embraced the popes
      in the communion of friendship and piety; knelt before the tomb,
      and consequently before the image, of the apostle; and joined,
      without scruple, in all the prayers and processions of the Roman
      liturgy. Would prudence or gratitude allow the pontiffs to
      renounce their benefactor? Had they a right to alienate his gift
      of the Exarchate? Had they power to abolish his government of
      Rome? The title of patrician was below the merit and greatness of
      Charlemagne; and it was only by reviving the Western empire that
      they could pay their obligations or secure their establishment.
      By this decisive measure they would finally eradicate the claims
      of the Greeks; from the debasement of a provincial town, the
      majesty of Rome would be restored: the Latin Christians would be
      united, under a supreme head, in their ancient metropolis; and
      the conquerors of the West would receive their crown from the
      successors of St. Peter. The Roman church would acquire a zealous
      and respectable advocate; and, under the shadow of the
      Carlovingian power, the bishop might exercise, with honor and
      safety, the government of the city. 88

      honorable species of fief or benefice—premuntur nocte
      caliginosa!]

      Before the ruin of Paganism in Rome, the competition for a
      wealthy bishopric had often been productive of tumult and
      bloodshed. The people was less numerous, but the times were more
      savage, the prize more important, and the chair of St. Peter was
      fiercely disputed by the leading ecclesiastics who aspired to the
      rank of sovereign. The reign of Adrian the First 89 surpasses the
      measure of past or succeeding ages; 90 the walls of Rome, the
      sacred patrimony, the ruin of the Lombards, and the friendship of
      Charlemagne, were the trophies of his fame: he secretly edified
      the throne of his successors, and displayed in a narrow space the
      virtues of a great prince. His memory was revered; but in the
      next election, a priest of the Lateran, Leo the Third, was
      preferred to the nephew and the favorite of Adrian, whom he had
      promoted to the first dignities of the church. Their acquiescence
      or repentance disguised, above four years, the blackest intention
      of revenge, till the day of a procession, when a furious band of
      conspirators dispersed the unarmed multitude, and assaulted with
      blows and wounds the sacred person of the pope. But their
      enterprise on his life or liberty was disappointed, perhaps by
      their own confusion and remorse. Leo was left for dead on the
      ground: on his revival from the swoon, the effect of his loss of
      blood, he recovered his speech and sight; and this natural event
      was improved to the miraculous restoration of his eyes and
      tongue, of which he had been deprived, twice deprived, by the
      knife of the assassins. 91 From his prison he escaped to the
      Vatican: the duke of Spoleto hastened to his rescue, Charlemagne
      sympathized in his injury, and in his camp of Paderborn in
      Westphalia accepted, or solicited, a visit from the Roman
      pontiff. Leo repassed the Alps with a commission of counts and
      bishops, the guards of his safety and the judges of his
      innocence; and it was not without reluctance, that the conqueror
      of the Saxons delayed till the ensuing year the personal
      discharge of this pious office. In his fourth and last
      pilgrimage, he was received at Rome with the due honors of king
      and patrician: Leo was permitted to purge himself by oath of the
      crimes imputed to his charge: his enemies were silenced, and the
      sacrilegious attempt against his life was punished by the mild
      and insufficient penalty of exile. On the festival of Christmas,
      the last year of the eighth century, Charlemagne appeared in the
      church of St. Peter; and, to gratify the vanity of Rome, he had
      exchanged the simple dress of his country for the habit of a
      patrician. 92 After the celebration of the holy mysteries, Leo
      suddenly placed a precious crown on his head, 93 and the dome
      resounded with the acclamations of the people, “Long life and
      victory to Charles, the most pious Augustus, crowned by God the
      great and pacific emperor of the Romans!” The head and body of
      Charlemagne were consecrated by the royal unction: after the
      example of the Caesars, he was saluted or adored by the pontiff:
      his coronation oath represents a promise to maintain the faith
      and privileges of the church; and the first-fruits were paid in
      his rich offerings to the shrine of his apostle. In his familiar
      conversation, the emperor protested the ignorance of the
      intentions of Leo, which he would have disappointed by his
      absence on that memorable day. But the preparations of the
      ceremony must have disclosed the secret; and the journey of
      Charlemagne reveals his knowledge and expectation: he had
      acknowledged that the Imperial title was the object of his
      ambition, and a Roman synod had pronounced, that it was the only
      adequate reward of his merit and services. 94

      The appellation of great has been often bestowed, and sometimes
      deserved; but Charlemagne is the only prince in whose favor the
      title has been indissolubly blended with the name. That name,
      with the addition of saint, is inserted in the Roman calendar;
      and the saint, by a rare felicity, is crowned with the praises of
      the historians and philosophers of an enlightened age. 95 His
      real merit is doubtless enhanced by the barbarism of the nation
      and the times from which he emerged: but the apparent magnitude
      of an object is likewise enlarged by an unequal comparison; and
      the ruins of Palmyra derive a casual splendor from the nakedness
      of the surrounding desert. Without injustice to his fame, I may
      discern some blemishes in the sanctity and greatness of the
      restorer of the Western empire. Of his moral virtues, chastity is
      not the most conspicuous: 96 but the public happiness could not
      be materially injured by his nine wives or concubines, the
      various indulgence of meaner or more transient amours, the
      multitude of his bastards whom he bestowed on the church, and the
      long celibacy and licentious manners of his daughters, 97 whom
      the father was suspected of loving with too fond a passion. 971 I
      shall be scarcely permitted to accuse the ambition of a
      conqueror; but in a day of equal retribution, the sons of his
      brother Carloman, the Merovingian princes of Aquitain, and the
      four thousand five hundred Saxons who were beheaded on the same
      spot, would have something to allege against the justice and
      humanity of Charlemagne. His treatment of the vanquished Saxons
      98 was an abuse of the right of conquest; his laws were not less
      sanguinary than his arms, and in the discussion of his motives,
      whatever is subtracted from bigotry must be imputed to temper.
      The sedentary reader is amazed by his incessant activity of mind
      and body; and his subjects and enemies were not less astonished
      at his sudden presence, at the moment when they believed him at
      the most distant extremity of the empire; neither peace nor war,
      nor summer nor winter, were a season of repose; and our fancy
      cannot easily reconcile the annals of his reign with the
      geography of his expeditions. 981 But this activity was a
      national, rather than a personal, virtue; the vagrant life of a
      Frank was spent in the chase, in pilgrimage, in military
      adventures; and the journeys of Charlemagne were distinguished
      only by a more numerous train and a more important purpose. His
      military renown must be tried by the scrutiny of his troops, his
      enemies, and his actions. Alexander conquered with the arms of
      Philip, but the two heroes who preceded Charlemagne bequeathed
      him their name, their examples, and the companions of their
      victories. At the head of his veteran and superior armies, he
      oppressed the savage or degenerate nations, who were incapable of
      confederating for their common safety: nor did he ever encounter
      an equal antagonist in numbers, in discipline, or in arms The
      science of war has been lost and revived with the arts of peace;
      but his campaigns are not illustrated by any siege or battle of
      singular difficulty and success; and he might behold, with envy,
      the Saracen trophies of his grandfather. After the Spanish
      expedition, his rear-guard was defeated in the Pyrenaean
      mountains; and the soldiers, whose situation was irretrievable,
      and whose valor was useless, might accuse, with their last
      breath, the want of skill or caution of their general. 99 I touch
      with reverence the laws of Charlemagne, so highly applauded by a
      respectable judge. They compose not a system, but a series, of
      occasional and minute edicts, for the correction of abuses, the
      reformation of manners, the economy of his farms, the care of his
      poultry, and even the sale of his eggs. He wished to improve the
      laws and the character of the Franks; and his attempts, however
      feeble and imperfect, are deserving of praise: the inveterate
      evils of the times were suspended or mollified by his government;
      100 but in his institutions I can seldom discover the general
      views and the immortal spirit of a legislator, who survives
      himself for the benefit of posterity. The union and stability of
      his empire depended on the life of a single man: he imitated the
      dangerous practice of dividing his kingdoms among his sons; and
      after his numerous diets, the whole constitution was left to
      fluctuate between the disorders of anarchy and despotism. His
      esteem for the piety and knowledge of the clergy tempted him to
      intrust that aspiring order with temporal dominion and civil
      jurisdiction; and his son Lewis, when he was stripped and
      degraded by the bishops, might accuse, in some measure, the
      imprudence of his father. His laws enforced the imposition of
      tithes, because the daemons had proclaimed in the air that the
      default of payment had been the cause of the last scarcity. 101
      The literary merits of Charlemagne are attested by the foundation
      of schools, the introduction of arts, the works which were
      published in his name, and his familiar connection with the
      subjects and strangers whom he invited to his court to educate
      both the prince and people. His own studies were tardy,
      laborious, and imperfect; if he spoke Latin, and understood
      Greek, he derived the rudiments of knowledge from conversation,
      rather than from books; and, in his mature age, the emperor
      strove to acquire the practice of writing, which every peasant
      now learns in his infancy. 102 The grammar and logic, the music
      and astronomy, of the times, were only cultivated as the
      handmaids of superstition; but the curiosity of the human mind
      must ultimately tend to its improvement, and the encouragement of
      learning reflects the purest and most pleasing lustre on the
      character of Charlemagne. 103 The dignity of his person, 104 the
      length of his reign, the prosperity of his arms, the vigor of his
      government, and the reverence of distant nations, distinguish him
      from the royal crowd; and Europe dates a new aera from his
      restoration of the Western empire.

      was endowed with matchless strength and appetite: at a single
      stroke of his good sword Joyeuse, he cut asunder a horseman and
      his horse; at a single repast, he devoured a goose, two fowls, a
      quarter of mutton, &c.]

      That empire was not unworthy of its title; 105 and some of the
      fairest kingdoms of Europe were the patrimony or conquest of a
      prince, who reigned at the same time in France, Spain, Italy,
      Germany, and Hungary. 106 I. The Roman province of Gaul had been
      transformed into the name and monarchy of France; but, in the
      decay of the Merovingian line, its limits were contracted by the
      independence of the Britons and the revolt of Aquitain.
      Charlemagne pursued, and confined, the Britons on the shores of
      the ocean; and that ferocious tribe, whose origin and language
      are so different from the French, was chastised by the imposition
      of tribute, hostages, and peace. After a long and evasive
      contest, the rebellion of the dukes of Aquitain was punished by
      the forfeiture of their province, their liberty, and their lives.

      Harsh and rigorous would have been such treatment of ambitious
      governors, who had too faithfully copied the mayors of the
      palace. But a recent discovery 107 has proved that these unhappy
      princes were the last and lawful heirs of the blood and sceptre
      of Clovis, and younger branch, from the brother of Dagobert, of
      the Merovingian house. Their ancient kingdom was reduced to the
      duchy of Gascogne, to the counties of Fesenzac and Armagnac, at
      the foot of the Pyrenees: their race was propagated till the
      beginning of the sixteenth century; and after surviving their
      Carlovingian tyrants, they were reserved to feel the injustice,
      or the favors, of a third dynasty. By the reunion of Aquitain,
      France was enlarged to its present boundaries, with the additions
      of the Netherlands and Spain, as far as the Rhine. II.

      The Saracens had been expelled from France by the grandfather and
      father of Charlemagne; but they still possessed the greatest part
      of Spain, from the rock of Gibraltar to the Pyrenees. Amidst
      their civil divisions, an Arabian emir of Saragossa implored his
      protection in the diet of Paderborn. Charlemagne undertook the
      expedition, restored the emir, and, without distinction of faith,
      impartially crushed the resistance of the Christians, and
      rewarded the obedience and services of the Mahometans. In his
      absence he instituted the Spanish march, 108 which extended from
      the Pyrenees to the River Ebro: Barcelona was the residence of
      the French governor: he possessed the counties of Rousillon and
      Catalonia; and the infant kingdoms of Navarre and Arragon were
      subject to his jurisdiction. III. As king of the Lombards, and
      patrician of Rome, he reigned over the greatest part of Italy,
      109 a tract of a thousand miles from the Alps to the borders of
      Calabria. The duchy of Beneventum, a Lombard fief, had spread, at
      the expense of the Greeks, over the modern kingdom of Naples. But
      Arrechis, the reigning duke, refused to be included in the
      slavery of his country; assumed the independent title of prince;
      and opposed his sword to the Carlovingian monarchy. His defence
      was firm, his submission was not inglorious, and the emperor was
      content with an easy tribute, the demolition of his fortresses,
      and the acknowledgement, on his coins, of a supreme lord. The
      artful flattery of his son Grimoald added the appellation of
      father, but he asserted his dignity with prudence, and Benventum
      insensibly escaped from the French yoke. 110 IV. Charlemagne was
      the first who united Germany under the same sceptre. The name of
      Oriental France is preserved in the circle of Franconia; and the
      people of Hesse and Thuringia were recently incorporated with the
      victors, by the conformity of religion and government. The
      Alemanni, so formidable to the Romans, were the faithful vassals
      and confederates of the Franks; and their country was inscribed
      within the modern limits of Alsace, Swabia, and Switzerland. The
      Bavarians, with a similar indulgence of their laws and manners,
      were less patient of a master: the repeated treasons of Tasillo
      justified the abolition of their hereditary dukes; and their
      power was shared among the counts, who judged and guarded that
      important frontier. But the north of Germany, from the Rhine and
      beyond the Elbe, was still hostile and Pagan; nor was it till
      after a war of thirty-three years that the Saxons bowed under the
      yoke of Christ and of Charlemagne. The idols and their votaries
      were extirpated: the foundation of eight bishoprics, of Munster,
      Osnaburgh, Paderborn, and Minden, of Bremen, Verden, Hildesheim,
      and Halberstadt, define, on either side of the Weser, the bounds
      of ancient Saxony these episcopal seats were the first schools
      and cities of that savage land; and the religion and humanity of
      the children atoned, in some degree, for the massacre of the
      parents. Beyond the Elbe, the Slavi, or Sclavonians, of similar
      manners and various denominations, overspread the modern
      dominions of Prussia, Poland, and Bohemia, and some transient
      marks of obedience have tempted the French historian to extend
      the empire to the Baltic and the Vistula. The conquest or
      conversion of those countries is of a more recent age; but the
      first union of Bohemia with the Germanic body may be justly
      ascribed to the arms of Charlemagne. V. He retaliated on the
      Avars, or Huns of Pannonia, the same calamities which they had
      inflicted on the nations. Their rings, the wooden fortifications
      which encircled their districts and villages, were broken down by
      the triple effort of a French army, that was poured into their
      country by land and water, through the Carpathian mountains and
      along the plain of the Danube. After a bloody conflict of eight
      years, the loss of some French generals was avenged by the
      slaughter of the most noble Huns: the relics of the nation
      submitted the royal residence of the chagan was left desolate and
      unknown; and the treasures, the rapine of two hundred and fifty
      years, enriched the victorious troops, or decorated the churches
      of Italy and Gaul. 111 After the reduction of Pannonia, the
      empire of Charlemagne was bounded only by the conflux of the
      Danube with the Teyss and the Save: the provinces of Istria,
      Liburnia, and Dalmatia, were an easy, though unprofitable,
      accession; and it was an effect of his moderation, that he left
      the maritime cities under the real or nominal sovereignty of the
      Greeks. But these distant possessions added more to the
      reputation than to the power of the Latin emperor; nor did he
      risk any ecclesiastical foundations to reclaim the Barbarians
      from their vagrant life and idolatrous worship. Some canals of
      communication between the rivers, the Saone and the Meuse, the
      Rhine and the Danube, were faintly attempted. 112 Their execution
      would have vivified the empire; and more cost and labor were
      often wasted in the structure of a cathedral. 1121

      Chapter XLIX: Conquest Of Italy By The Franks.—Part V.

      If we retrace the outlines of this geographical picture, it will
      be seen that the empire of the Franks extended, between east and
      west, from the Ebro to the Elbe or Vistula; between the north and
      south, from the duchy of Beneventum to the River Eyder, the
      perpetual boundary of Germany and Denmark. The personal and
      political importance of Charlemagne was magnified by the distress
      and division of the rest of Europe. The islands of Great Britain
      and Ireland were disputed by a crowd of princes of Saxon or
      Scottish origin: and, after the loss of Spain, the Christian and
      Gothic kingdom of Alphonso the Chaste was confined to the narrow
      range of the Asturian mountains. These petty sovereigns revered
      the power or virtue of the Carlovingian monarch, implored the
      honor and support of his alliance, and styled him their common
      parent, the sole and supreme emperor of the West. 113 He
      maintained a more equal intercourse with the caliph Harun al
      Rashid, 114 whose dominion stretched from Africa to India, and
      accepted from his ambassadors a tent, a water-clock, an elephant,
      and the keys of the Holy Sepulchre. It is not easy to conceive
      the private friendship of a Frank and an Arab, who were strangers
      to each other’s person, and language, and religion: but their
      public correspondence was founded on vanity, and their remote
      situation left no room for a competition of interest. Two thirds
      of the Western empire of Rome were subject to Charlemagne, and
      the deficiency was amply supplied by his command of the
      inaccessible or invincible nations of Germany. But in the choice
      of his enemies, 1141 we may be reasonably surprised that he so
      often preferred the poverty of the north to the riches of the
      south. The three-and-thirty campaigns laboriously consumed in the
      woods and morasses of Germany would have sufficed to assert the
      amplitude of his title by the expulsion of the Greeks from Italy
      and the Saracens from Spain. The weakness of the Greeks would
      have insured an easy victory; and the holy crusade against the
      Saracens would have been prompted by glory and revenge, and
      loudly justified by religion and policy. Perhaps, in his
      expeditions beyond the Rhine and the Elbe, he aspired to save his
      monarchy from the fate of the Roman empire, to disarm the enemies
      of civilized society, and to eradicate the seed of future
      emigrations. But it has been wisely observed, that, in a light of
      precaution, all conquest must be ineffectual, unless it could be
      universal, since the increasing circle must be involved in a
      larger sphere of hostility. 115 The subjugation of Germany
      withdrew the veil which had so long concealed the continent or
      islands of Scandinavia from the knowledge of Europe, and awakened
      the torpid courage of their barbarous natives. The fiercest of
      the Saxon idolaters escaped from the Christian tyrant to their
      brethren of the North; the Ocean and Mediterranean were covered
      with their piratical fleets; and Charlemagne beheld with a sigh
      the destructive progress of the Normans, who, in less than
      seventy years, precipitated the fall of his race and monarchy.

      Life of Charlemagne.—M.]

      115 (return) [ Gaillard, tom. ii. p. 361-365, 471-476, 492. I
      have borrowed his judicious remarks on Charlemagne’s plan of
      conquest, and the judicious distinction of his enemies of the
      first and the second enceinte, (tom. ii. p. 184, 509, &c.)]

      Had the pope and the Romans revived the primitive constitution,
      the titles of emperor and Augustus were conferred on Charlemagne
      for the term of his life; and his successors, on each vacancy,
      must have ascended the throne by a formal or tacit election. But
      the association of his son Lewis the Pious asserts the
      independent right of monarchy and conquest, and the emperor seems
      on this occasion to have foreseen and prevented the latent claims
      of the clergy. The royal youth was commanded to take the crown
      from the altar, and with his own hands to place it on his head,
      as a gift which he held from God, his father, and the nation. 116
      The same ceremony was repeated, though with less energy, in the
      subsequent associations of Lothaire and Lewis the Second: the
      Carlovingian sceptre was transmitted from father to son in a
      lineal descent of four generations; and the ambition of the popes
      was reduced to the empty honor of crowning and anointing these
      hereditary princes, who were already invested with their power
      and dominions. The pious Lewis survived his brothers, and
      embraced the whole empire of Charlemagne; but the nations and the
      nobles, his bishops and his children, quickly discerned that this
      mighty mass was no longer inspired by the same soul; and the
      foundations were undermined to the centre, while the external
      surface was yet fair and entire. After a war, or battle, which
      consumed one hundred thousand Franks, the empire was divided by
      treaty between his three sons, who had violated every filial and
      fraternal duty. The kingdoms of Germany and France were forever
      separated; the provinces of Gaul, between the Rhone and the Alps,
      the Meuse and the Rhine, were assigned, with Italy, to the
      Imperial dignity of Lothaire. In the partition of his share,
      Lorraine and Arles, two recent and transitory kingdoms, were
      bestowed on the younger children; and Lewis the Second, his
      eldest son, was content with the realm of Italy, the proper and
      sufficient patrimony of a Roman emperor. On his death without any
      male issue, the vacant throne was disputed by his uncles and
      cousins, and the popes most dexterously seized the occasion of
      judging the claims and merits of the candidates, and of bestowing
      on the most obsequious, or most liberal, the Imperial office of
      advocate of the Roman church. The dregs of the Carlovingian race
      no longer exhibited any symptoms of virtue or power, and the
      ridiculous epithets of the bard, the stammerer, the fat, and the
      simple, distinguished the tame and uniform features of a crowd of
      kings alike deserving of oblivion. By the failure of the
      collateral branches, the whole inheritance devolved to Charles
      the Fat, the last emperor of his family: his insanity authorized
      the desertion of Germany, Italy, and France: he was deposed in a
      diet, and solicited his daily bread from the rebels by whose
      contempt his life and liberty had been spared. According to the
      measure of their force, the governors, the bishops, and the
      lords, usurped the fragments of the falling empire; and some
      preference was shown to the female or illegitimate blood of
      Charlemagne. Of the greater part, the title and possession were
      alike doubtful, and the merit was adequate to the contracted
      scale of their dominions. Those who could appear with an army at
      the gates of Rome were crowned emperors in the Vatican; but their
      modesty was more frequently satisfied with the appellation of
      kings of Italy: and the whole term of seventy-four years may be
      deemed a vacancy, from the abdication of Charles the Fat to the
      establishment of Otho the First.

      Carlovingians, see the historians of France, Italy, and Germany;

      pictures are sometimes just, and always pleasing.]

      Otho 117 was of the noble race of the dukes of Saxony; and if he
      truly descended from Witikind, the adversary and proselyte of
      Charlemagne, the posterity of a vanquished people was exalted to
      reign over their conquerors. His father, Henry the Fowler, was
      elected, by the suffrage of the nation, to save and institute the
      kingdom of Germany. Its limits 118 were enlarged on every side by
      his son, the first and greatest of the Othos. A portion of Gaul,
      to the west of the Rhine, along the banks of the Meuse and the
      Moselle, was assigned to the Germans, by whose blood and language
      it has been tinged since the time of Caesar and Tacitus.

      Between the Rhine, the Rhone, and the Alps, the successors of
      Otho acquired a vain supremacy over the broken kingdoms of
      Burgundy and Arles. In the North, Christianity was propagated by
      the sword of Otho, the conqueror and apostle of the Slavic
      nations of the Elbe and Oder: the marches of Brandenburgh and
      Sleswick were fortified with German colonies; and the king of
      Denmark, the dukes of Poland and Bohemia, confessed themselves
      his tributary vassals. At the head of a victorious army, he
      passed the Alps, subdued the kingdom of Italy, delivered the
      pope, and forever fixed the Imperial crown in the name and nation
      of Germany. From that memorable aera, two maxims of public
      jurisprudence were introduced by force and ratified by time. I.
      That the prince, who was elected in the German diet, acquired,
      from that instant, the subject kingdoms of Italy and Rome. II.
      But that he might not legally assume the titles of emperor and
      Augustus, till he had received the crown from the hands of the
      Roman pontiff. 119

      vassals, and her neighbors.]

      119 (return) [ The power of custom forces me to number Conrad I.
      and Henry I., the Fowler, in the list of emperors, a title which

      reckon the princes who have been crowned at Rome.]

      The Imperial dignity of Charlemagne was announced to the East by
      the alteration of his style; and instead of saluting his fathers,
      the Greek emperors, he presumed to adopt the more equal and
      familiar appellation of brother. 120 Perhaps in his connection
      with Irene he aspired to the name of husband: his embassy to
      Constantinople spoke the language of peace and friendship, and
      might conceal a treaty of marriage with that ambitious princess,
      who had renounced the most sacred duties of a mother. The nature,
      the duration, the probable consequences of such a union between
      two distant and dissonant empires, it is impossible to
      conjecture; but the unanimous silence of the Latins may teach us
      to suspect, that the report was invented by the enemies of Irene,
      to charge her with the guilt of betraying the church and state to
      the strangers of the West. 121 The French ambassadors were the
      spectators, and had nearly been the victims, of the conspiracy of
      Nicephorus, and the national hatred. Constantinople was
      exasperated by the treason and sacrilege of ancient Rome: a
      proverb, “That the Franks were good friends and bad neighbors,”
      was in every one’s mouth; but it was dangerous to provoke a
      neighbor who might be tempted to reiterate, in the church of St.
      Sophia, the ceremony of his Imperial coronation. After a tedious
      journey of circuit and delay, the ambassadors of Nicephorus found
      him in his camp, on the banks of the River Sala; and Charlemagne
      affected to confound their vanity by displaying, in a Franconian
      village, the pomp, or at least the pride, of the Byzantine
      palace. 122 The Greeks were successively led through four halls
      of audience: in the first they were ready to fall prostrate
      before a splendid personage in a chair of state, till he informed
      them that he was only a servant, the constable, or master of the
      horse, of the emperor. The same mistake, and the same answer,
      were repeated in the apartments of the count palatine, the
      steward, and the chamberlain; and their impatience was gradually
      heightened, till the doors of the presence-chamber were thrown
      open, and they beheld the genuine monarch, on his throne,
      enriched with the foreign luxury which he despised, and encircled
      with the love and reverence of his victorious chiefs. A treaty of
      peace and alliance was concluded between the two empires, and the
      limits of the East and West were defined by the right of present
      possession. But the Greeks 123 soon forgot this humiliating
      equality, or remembered it only to hate the Barbarians by whom it
      was extorted. During the short union of virtue and power, they
      respectfully saluted the august Charlemagne, with the
      acclamations of basileus, and emperor of the Romans. As soon as
      these qualities were separated in the person of his pious son,
      the Byzantine letters were inscribed, “To the king, or, as he
      styles himself, the emperor of the Franks and Lombards.” When
      both power and virtue were extinct, they despoiled Lewis the
      Second of his hereditary title, and with the barbarous
      appellation of rex or rega, degraded him among the crowd of Latin
      princes. His reply 124 is expressive of his weakness: he proves,
      with some learning, that, both in sacred and profane history, the
      name of king is synonymous with the Greek word basileus: if, at
      Constantinople, it were assumed in a more exclusive and imperial
      sense, he claims from his ancestors, and from the popes, a just
      participation of the honors of the Roman purple. The same
      controversy was revived in the reign of the Othos; and their
      ambassador describes, in lively colors, the insolence of the
      Byzantine court. 125 The Greeks affected to despise the poverty
      and ignorance of the Franks and Saxons; and in their last decline
      refused to prostitute to the kings of Germany the title of Roman
      emperors.

      exhorted Nicephorus, emperor of the Greeks, to make peace with
      Otho, the august emperor of the Romans—quae inscriptio secundum
      Graecos peccatoria et temeraria... imperatorem inquiunt,
      universalem, Romanorum, Augustum, magnum, solum, Nicephorum, (p.
      486.)]

      These emperors, in the election of the popes, continued to
      exercise the powers which had been assumed by the Gothic and
      Grecian princes; and the importance of this prerogative increased
      with the temporal estate and spiritual jurisdiction of the Roman
      church. In the Christian aristocracy, the principal members of
      the clergy still formed a senate to assist the administration,
      and to supply the vacancy, of the bishop. Rome was divided into
      twenty-eight parishes, and each parish was governed by a cardinal
      priest, or presbyter, a title which, however common or modest in
      its origin, has aspired to emulate the purple of kings. Their
      number was enlarged by the association of the seven deacons of
      the most considerable hospitals, the seven palatine judges of the
      Lateran, and some dignitaries of the church. This ecclesiastical
      senate was directed by the seven cardinal-bishops of the Roman
      province, who were less occupied in the suburb dioceses of Ostia,
      Porto, Velitrae, Tusculum, Praeneste, Tibur, and the Sabines,
      than by their weekly service in the Lateran, and their superior
      share in the honors and authority of the apostolic see. On the
      death of the pope, these bishops recommended a successor to the
      suffrage of the college of cardinals, 126 and their choice was
      ratified or rejected by the applause or clamor of the Roman
      people. But the election was imperfect; nor could the pontiff be
      legally consecrated till the emperor, the advocate of the church,
      had graciously signified his approbation and consent. The royal
      commissioner examined, on the spot, the form and freedom of the
      proceedings; nor was it till after a previous scrutiny into the
      qualifications of the candidates, that he accepted an oath of
      fidelity, and confirmed the donations which had successively
      enriched the patrimony of St. Peter. In the frequent schisms, the
      rival claims were submitted to the sentence of the emperor; and
      in a synod of bishops he presumed to judge, to condemn, and to
      punish, the crimes of a guilty pontiff. Otho the First imposed a
      treaty on the senate and people, who engaged to prefer the
      candidate most acceptable to his majesty: 127 his successors
      anticipated or prevented their choice: they bestowed the Roman
      benefice, like the bishoprics of Cologne or Bamberg, on their
      chancellors or preceptors; and whatever might be the merit of a
      Frank or Saxon, his name sufficiently attests the interposition
      of foreign power. These acts of prerogative were most speciously
      excused by the vices of a popular election. The competitor who
      had been excluded by the cardinals appealed to the passions or
      avarice of the multitude; the Vatican and the Lateran were
      stained with blood; and the most powerful senators, the marquises
      of Tuscany and the counts of Tusculum, held the apostolic see in
      a long and disgraceful servitude. The Roman pontiffs, of the
      ninth and tenth centuries, were insulted, imprisoned, and
      murdered, by their tyrants; and such was their indigence, after
      the loss and usurpation of the ecclesiastical patrimonies, that
      they could neither support the state of a prince, nor exercise
      the charity of a priest. 128 The influence of two sister
      prostitutes, Marozia and Theodora, was founded on their wealth
      and beauty, their political and amorous intrigues: the most
      strenuous of their lovers were rewarded with the Roman mitre, and
      their reign 129 may have suggested to the darker ages 130 the
      fable 131 of a female pope. 132 The bastard son, the grandson,
      and the great-grandson of Marozia, a rare genealogy, were seated
      in the chair of St. Peter, and it was at the age of nineteen
      years that the second of these became the head of the Latin
      church. 1321 His youth and manhood were of a suitable complexion;
      and the nations of pilgrims could bear testimony to the charges
      that were urged against him in a Roman synod, and in the presence
      of Otho the Great. As John XII. had renounced the dress and
      decencies of his profession, the soldier may not perhaps be
      dishonored by the wine which he drank, the blood that he spilt,
      the flames that he kindled, or the licentious pursuits of gaming
      and hunting. His open simony might be the consequence of
      distress; and his blasphemous invocation of Jupiter and Venus, if
      it be true, could not possibly be serious. But we read, with some
      surprise, that the worthy grandson of Marozia lived in public
      adultery with the matrons of Rome; that the Lateran palace was
      turned into a school for prostitution, and that his rapes of
      virgins and widows had deterred the female pilgrims from visiting
      the tomb of St. Peter, lest, in the devout act, they should be
      violated by his successor. 133 The Protestants have dwelt with
      malicious pleasure on these characters of Antichrist; but to a
      philosophic eye, the vices of the clergy are far less dangerous
      than their virtues. After a long series of scandal, the apostolic
      see was reformed and exalted by the austerity and zeal of Gregory
      VII. That ambitious monk devoted his life to the execution of two
      projects. I. To fix in the college of cardinals the freedom and
      independence of election, and forever to abolish the right or
      usurpation of the emperors and the Roman people. II. To bestow
      and resume the Western empire as a fief or benefice 134 of the
      church, and to extend his temporal dominion over the kings and
      kingdoms of the earth. After a contest of fifty years, the first
      of these designs was accomplished by the firm support of the
      ecclesiastical order, whose liberty was connected with that of
      their chief. But the second attempt, though it was crowned with
      some partial and apparent success, has been vigorously resisted
      by the secular power, and finally extinguished by the improvement
      of human reason.

      In the revival of the empire of empire of Rome, neither the
      bishop nor the people could bestow on Charlemagne or Otho the
      provinces which were lost, as they had been won, by the chance of
      arms. But the Romans were free to choose a master for themselves;
      and the powers which had been delegated to the patrician, were
      irrevocably granted to the French and Saxon emperors of the West.
      The broken records of the times 135 preserve some remembrance of
      their palace, their mint, their tribunal, their edicts, and the
      sword of justice, which, as late as the thirteenth century, was
      derived from Caesar to the praefect of the city. 136 Between the
      arts of the popes and the violence of the people, this supremacy
      was crushed and annihilated. Content with the titles of emperor
      and Augustus, the successors of Charlemagne neglected to assert
      this local jurisdiction. In the hour of prosperity, their
      ambition was diverted by more alluring objects; and in the decay
      and division of the empire, they were oppressed by the defence of
      their hereditary provinces. Amidst the ruins of Italy, the famous
      Marozia invited one of the usurpers to assume the character of
      her third husband; and Hugh, king of Burgundy was introduced by
      her faction into the mole of Hadrian or Castle of St. Angelo,
      which commands the principal bridge and entrance of Rome. Her son
      by the first marriage, Alberic, was compelled to attend at the
      nuptial banquet; but his reluctant and ungraceful service was
      chastised with a blow by his new father. The blow was productive
      of a revolution. “Romans,” exclaimed the youth, “once you were
      the masters of the world, and these Burgundians the most abject
      of your slaves. They now reign, these voracious and brutal
      savages, and my injury is the commencement of your servitude.”
      137 The alarum bell rang to arms in every quarter of the city:
      the Burgundians retreated with haste and shame; Marozia was
      imprisoned by her victorious son, and his brother, Pope John XI.,
      was reduced to the exercise of his spiritual functions. With the
      title of prince, Alberic possessed above twenty years the
      government of Rome; and he is said to have gratified the popular
      prejudice, by restoring the office, or at least the title, of
      consuls and tribunes. His son and heir Octavian assumed, with the
      pontificate, the name of John XII.: like his predecessor, he was
      provoked by the Lombard princes to seek a deliverer for the
      church and republic; and the services of Otho were rewarded with
      the Imperial dignity. But the Saxon was imperious, the Romans
      were impatient, the festival of the coronation was disturbed by
      the secret conflict of prerogative and freedom, and Otho
      commanded his sword-bearer not to stir from his person, lest he
      should be assaulted and murdered at the foot of the altar. 138
      Before he repassed the Alps, the emperor chastised the revolt of
      the people and the ingratitude of John XII. The pope was degraded
      in a synod; the praefect was mounted on an ass, whipped through
      the city, and cast into a dungeon; thirteen of the most guilty
      were hanged, others were mutilated or banished; and this severe
      process was justified by the ancient laws of Theodosius and
      Justinian. The voice of fame has accused the second Otho of a
      perfidious and bloody act, the massacre of the senators, whom he
      had invited to his table under the fair semblance of hospitality
      and friendship. 139 In the minority of his son Otho the Third,
      Rome made a bold attempt to shake off the Saxon yoke, and the
      consul Crescentius was the Brutus of the republic. From the
      condition of a subject and an exile, he twice rose to the command
      of the city, oppressed, expelled, and created the popes, and
      formed a conspiracy for restoring the authority of the Greek
      emperors. 1391 In the fortress of St. Angelo, he maintained an
      obstinate siege, till the unfortunate consul was betrayed by a
      promise of safety: his body was suspended on a gibbet, and his
      head was exposed on the battlements of the castle. By a reverse
      of fortune, Otho, after separating his troops, was besieged three
      days, without food, in his palace; and a disgraceful escape saved
      him from the justice or fury of the Romans. The senator Ptolemy
      was the leader of the people, and the widow of Crescentius
      enjoyed the pleasure or the fame of revenging her husband, by a
      poison which she administered to her Imperial lover. It was the
      design of Otho the Third to abandon the ruder countries of the
      North, to erect his throne in Italy, and to revive the
      institutions of the Roman monarchy. But his successors only once
      in their lives appeared on the banks of the Tyber, to receive
      their crown in the Vatican. 140 Their absence was contemptible,
      their presence odious and formidable. They descended from the
      Alps, at the head of their barbarians, who were strangers and
      enemies to the country; and their transient visit was a scene of
      tumult and bloodshed. 141 A faint remembrance of their ancestors
      still tormented the Romans; and they beheld with pious
      indignation the succession of Saxons, Franks, Swabians, and
      Bohemians, who usurped the purple and prerogatives of the
      Caesars.

      Chapter XLIX: Conquest Of Italy By The Franks.—Part VI.

      There is nothing perhaps more adverse to nature and reason than
      to hold in obedience remote countries and foreign nations, in
      opposition to their inclination and interest. A torrent of
      Barbarians may pass over the earth, but an extensive empire must
      be supported by a refined system of policy and oppression; in the
      centre, an absolute power, prompt in action and rich in
      resources; a swift and easy communication with the extreme parts;
      fortifications to check the first effort of rebellion; a regular
      administration to protect and punish; and a well-disciplined army
      to inspire fear, without provoking discontent and despair. Far
      different was the situation of the German Caesars, who were
      ambitious to enslave the kingdom of Italy. Their patrimonial
      estates were stretched along the Rhine, or scattered in the
      provinces; but this ample domain was alienated by the imprudence
      or distress of successive princes; and their revenue, from minute
      and vexatious prerogative, was scarcely sufficient for the
      maintenance of their household. Their troops were formed by the
      legal or voluntary service of their feudal vassals, who passed
      the Alps with reluctance, assumed the license of rapine and
      disorder, and capriciously deserted before the end of the
      campaign. Whole armies were swept away by the pestilential
      influence of the climate: the survivors brought back the bones of
      their princes and nobles, 142 and the effects of their own
      intemperance were often imputed to the treachery and malice of
      the Italians, who rejoiced at least in the calamities of the
      Barbarians. This irregular tyranny might contend on equal terms
      with the petty tyrants of Italy; nor can the people, or the
      reader, be much interested in the event of the quarrel. But in
      the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the Lombards rekindled the
      flame of industry and freedom; and the generous example was at
      length imitated by the republics of Tuscany. 1421 In the Italian
      cities a municipal government had never been totally abolished;
      and their first privileges were granted by the favor and policy
      of the emperors, who were desirous of erecting a plebeian barrier
      against the independence of the nobles. But their rapid progress,
      the daily extension of their power and pretensions, were founded
      on the numbers and spirit of these rising communities. 143 Each
      city filled the measure of her diocese or district: the
      jurisdiction of the counts and bishops, of the marquises and
      counts, was banished from the land; and the proudest nobles were
      persuaded or compelled to desert their solitary castles, and to
      embrace the more honorable character of freemen and magistrates.
      The legislative authority was inherent in the general assembly;
      but the executive powers were intrusted to three consuls,
      annually chosen from the three orders of captains, valvassors,
      144 and commons, into which the republic was divided. Under the
      protection of equal law, the labors of agriculture and commerce
      were gradually revived; but the martial spirit of the Lombards
      was nourished by the presence of danger; and as often as the bell
      was rung, or the standard 145 erected, the gates of the city
      poured forth a numerous and intrepid band, whose zeal in their
      own cause was soon guided by the use and discipline of arms. At
      the foot of these popular ramparts, the pride of the Caesars was
      overthrown; and the invincible genius of liberty prevailed over
      the two Frederics, the greatest princes of the middle age; the
      first, superior perhaps in military prowess; the second, who
      undoubtedly excelled in the softer accomplishments of peace and
      learning.

      Ambitious of restoring the splendor of the purple, Frederic the
      First invaded the republics of Lombardy, with the arts of a
      statesman, the valor of a soldier, and the cruelty of a tyrant.
      The recent discovery of the Pandects had renewed a science most
      favorable to despotism; and his venal advocates proclaimed the
      emperor the absolute master of the lives and properties of his
      subjects. His royal prerogatives, in a less odious sense, were
      acknowledged in the diet of Roncaglia; and the revenue of Italy
      was fixed at thirty thousand pounds of silver, 146 which were
      multiplied to an indefinite demand by the rapine of the fiscal
      officers. The obstinate cities were reduced by the terror or the
      force of his arms: his captives were delivered to the
      executioner, or shot from his military engines; and. after the
      siege and surrender of Milan, the buildings of that stately
      capital were razed to the ground, three hundred hostages were
      sent into Germany, and the inhabitants were dispersed in four
      villages, under the yoke of the inflexible conqueror. 147 But
      Milan soon rose from her ashes; and the league of Lombardy was
      cemented by distress: their cause was espoused by Venice, Pope
      Alexander the Third, and the Greek emperor: the fabric of
      oppression was overturned in a day; and in the treaty of
      Constance, Frederic subscribed, with some reservations, the
      freedom of four-and-twenty cities. His grandson contended with
      their vigor and maturity; but Frederic the Second 148 was endowed
      with some personal and peculiar advantages. His birth and
      education recommended him to the Italians; and in the implacable
      discord of the two factions, the Ghibelins were attached to the
      emperor, while the Guelfs displayed the banner of liberty and the
      church. The court of Rome had slumbered, when his father Henry
      the Sixth was permitted to unite with the empire the kingdoms of
      Naples and Sicily; and from these hereditary realms the son
      derived an ample and ready supply of troops and treasure. Yet
      Frederic the Second was finally oppressed by the arms of the
      Lombards and the thunders of the Vatican: his kingdom was given
      to a stranger, and the last of his family was beheaded at Naples
      on a public scaffold. During sixty years, no emperor appeared in
      Italy, and the name was remembered only by the ignominious sale
      of the last relics of sovereignty.

      The Barbarian conquerors of the West were pleased to decorate
      their chief with the title of emperor; but it was not their
      design to invest him with the despotism of Constantine and
      Justinian. The persons of the Germans were free, their conquests
      were their own, and their national character was animated by a
      spirit which scorned the servile jurisprudence of the new or the
      ancient Rome. It would have been a vain and dangerous attempt to
      impose a monarch on the armed freemen, who were impatient of a
      magistrate; on the bold, who refused to obey; on the powerful,
      who aspired to command. The empire of Charlemagne and Otho was
      distributed among the dukes of the nations or provinces, the
      counts of the smaller districts, and the margraves of the marches
      or frontiers, who all united the civil and military authority as
      it had been delegated to the lieutenants of the first Caesars.
      The Roman governors, who, for the most part, were soldiers of
      fortune, seduced their mercenary legions, assumed the Imperial
      purple, and either failed or succeeded in their revolt, without
      wounding the power and unity of government. If the dukes,
      margraves, and counts of Germany, were less audacious in their
      claims, the consequences of their success were more lasting and
      pernicious to the state. Instead of aiming at the supreme rank,
      they silently labored to establish and appropriate their
      provincial independence. Their ambition was seconded by the
      weight of their estates and vassals, their mutual example and
      support, the common interest of the subordinate nobility, the
      change of princes and families, the minorities of Otho the Third
      and Henry the Fourth, the ambition of the popes, and the vain
      pursuit of the fugitive crowns of Italy and Rome. All the
      attributes of regal and territorial jurisdiction were gradually
      usurped by the commanders of the provinces; the right of peace
      and war, of life and death, of coinage and taxation, of foreign
      alliance and domestic economy. Whatever had been seized by
      violence, was ratified by favor or distress, was granted as the
      price of a doubtful vote or a voluntary service; whatever had
      been granted to one could not, without injury, be denied to his
      successor or equal; and every act of local or temporary
      possession was insensibly moulded into the constitution of the
      Germanic kingdom. In every province, the visible presence of the
      duke or count was interposed between the throne and the nobles;
      the subjects of the law became the vassals of a private chief;
      and the standard which he received from his sovereign, was often
      raised against him in the field. The temporal power of the clergy
      was cherished and exalted by the superstition or policy of the
      Carlovingian and Saxon dynasties, who blindly depended on their
      moderation and fidelity; and the bishoprics of Germany were made
      equal in extent and privilege, superior in wealth and population,
      to the most ample states of the military order. As long as the
      emperors retained the prerogative of bestowing on every vacancy
      these ecclesiastic and secular benefices, their cause was
      maintained by the gratitude or ambition of their friends and
      favorites. But in the quarrel of the investitures, they were
      deprived of their influence over the episcopal chapters; the
      freedom of election was restored, and the sovereign was reduced,
      by a solemn mockery, to his first prayers, the recommendation,
      once in his reign, to a single prebend in each church. The
      secular governors, instead of being recalled at the will of a
      superior, could be degraded only by the sentence of their peers.
      In the first age of the monarchy, the appointment of the son to
      the duchy or county of his father, was solicited as a favor; it
      was gradually obtained as a custom, and extorted as a right: the
      lineal succession was often extended to the collateral or female
      branches; the states of the empire (their popular, and at length
      their legal, appellation) were divided and alienated by testament
      and sale; and all idea of a public trust was lost in that of a
      private and perpetual inheritance. The emperor could not even be
      enriched by the casualties of forfeiture and extinction: within
      the term of a year, he was obliged to dispose of the vacant fief;
      and, in the choice of the candidate, it was his duty to consult
      either the general or the provincial diet.

      After the death of Frederic the Second, Germany was left a
      monster with a hundred heads. A crowd of princes and prelates
      disputed the ruins of the empire: the lords of innumerable
      castles were less prone to obey, than to imitate, their
      superiors; and, according to the measure of their strength, their
      incessant hostilities received the names of conquest or robbery.
      Such anarchy was the inevitable consequence of the laws and
      manners of Europe; and the kingdoms of France and Italy were
      shivered into fragments by the violence of the same tempest. But
      the Italian cities and the French vassals were divided and
      destroyed, while the union of the Germans has produced, under the
      name of an empire, a great system of a federative republic. In
      the frequent and at last the perpetual institution of diets, a
      national spirit was kept alive, and the powers of a common
      legislature are still exercised by the three branches or colleges
      of the electors, the princes, and the free and Imperial cities of
      Germany. I. Seven of the most powerful feudatories were permitted
      to assume, with a distinguished name and rank, the exclusive
      privilege of choosing the Roman emperor; and these electors were
      the king of Bohemia, the duke of Saxony, the margrave of
      Brandenburgh, the count palatine of the Rhine, and the three
      archbishops of Mentz, of Treves, and of Cologne. II. The college
      of princes and prelates purged themselves of a promiscuous
      multitude: they reduced to four representative votes the long
      series of independent counts, and excluded the nobles or
      equestrian order, sixty thousand of whom, as in the Polish diets,
      had appeared on horseback in the field of election. III. The
      pride of birth and dominion, of the sword and the mitre, wisely
      adopted the commons as the third branch of the legislature, and,
      in the progress of society, they were introduced about the same
      aera into the national assemblies of France England, and Germany.

      The Hanseatic League commanded the trade and navigation of the
      north: the confederates of the Rhine secured the peace and
      intercourse of the inland country; the influence of the cities
      has been adequate to their wealth and policy, and their negative
      still invalidates the acts of the two superior colleges of
      electors and princes. 149

      It is in the fourteenth century that we may view in the strongest
      light the state and contrast of the Roman empire of Germany,
      which no longer held, except on the borders of the Rhine and
      Danube, a single province of Trajan or Constantine. Their
      unworthy successors were the counts of Hapsburgh, of Nassau, of
      Luxemburgh, and Schwartzenburgh: the emperor Henry the Seventh
      procured for his son the crown of Bohemia, and his grandson
      Charles the Fourth was born among a people strange and barbarous
      in the estimation of the Germans themselves. 150 After the
      excommunication of Lewis of Bavaria, he received the gift or
      promise of the vacant empire from the Roman pontiffs, who, in the
      exile and captivity of Avignon, affected the dominion of the
      earth. The death of his competitors united the electoral college,
      and Charles was unanimously saluted king of the Romans, and
      future emperor; a title which, in the same age, was prostituted
      to the Caesars of Germany and Greece. The German emperor was no
      more than the elective and impotent magistrate of an aristocracy
      of princes, who had not left him a village that he might call his
      own. His best prerogative was the right of presiding and
      proposing in the national senate, which was convened at his
      summons; and his native kingdom of Bohemia, less opulent than the
      adjacent city of Nuremberg, was the firmest seat of his power and
      the richest source of his revenue. The army with which he passed
      the Alps consisted of three hundred horse. In the cathedral of
      St. Ambrose, Charles was crowned with the iron crown, which
      tradition ascribed to the Lombard monarchy; but he was admitted
      only with a peaceful train; the gates of the city were shut upon
      him; and the king of Italy was held a captive by the arms of the
      Visconti, whom he confirmed in the sovereignty of Milan. In the
      Vatican he was again crowned with the golden crown of the empire;
      but, in obedience to a secret treaty, the Roman emperor
      immediately withdrew, without reposing a single night within the
      walls of Rome. The eloquent Petrarch, 151 whose fancy revived the
      visionary glories of the Capitol, deplores and upbraids the
      ignominious flight of the Bohemian; and even his contemporaries
      could observe, that the sole exercise of his authority was in the
      lucrative sale of privileges and titles. The gold of Italy
      secured the election of his son; but such was the shameful
      poverty of the Roman emperor, that his person was arrested by a
      butcher in the streets of Worms, and was detained in the public
      inn, as a pledge or hostage for the payment of his expenses.

      considered as a Barbarian. After his education at Paris, he
      recovered the use of the Bohemian, his native, idiom; and the
      emperor conversed and wrote with equal facility in French, Latin,
      Italian, and German, (Struvius, p. 615, 616.) Petrarch always
      represents him as a polite and learned prince.]

      151 (return) [ Besides the German and Italian historians, the
      expedition of Charles IV. is painted in lively and original
      colors in the curious Memoires sur la Vie de Petrarque, tom. iii.
      p. 376-430, by the Abbe de Sade, whose prolixity has never been
      blamed by any reader of taste and curiosity.]

      From this humiliating scene, let us turn to the apparent majesty
      of the same Charles in the diets of the empire. The golden bull,
      which fixes the Germanic constitution, is promulgated in the
      style of a sovereign and legislator. A hundred princes bowed
      before his throne, and exalted their own dignity by the voluntary
      honors which they yielded to their chief or minister. At the
      royal banquet, the hereditary great officers, the seven electors,
      who in rank and title were equal to kings, performed their solemn
      and domestic service of the palace. The seals of the triple
      kingdom were borne in state by the archbishops of Mentz, Cologne,
      and Treves, the perpetual arch-chancellors of Germany, Italy, and
      Arles. The great marshal, on horseback, exercised his function
      with a silver measure of oats, which he emptied on the ground,
      and immediately dismounted to regulate the order of the guests.
      The great steward, the count palatine of the Rhine, place the
      dishes on the table. The great chamberlain, the margrave of
      Brandenburgh, presented, after the repast, the golden ewer and
      basin, to wash. The king of Bohemia, as great cup-bearer, was
      represented by the emperor’s brother, the duke of Luxemburgh and
      Brabant; and the procession was closed by the great huntsmen, who
      introduced a boar and a stag, with a loud chorus of horns and
      hounds. 152 Nor was the supremacy of the emperor confined to
      Germany alone: the hereditary monarchs of Europe confessed the
      preeminence of his rank and dignity: he was the first of the
      Christian princes, the temporal head of the great republic of the
      West: 153 to his person the title of majesty was long
      appropriated; and he disputed with the pope the sublime
      prerogative of creating kings and assembling councils. The oracle
      of the civil law, the learned Bartolus, was a pensioner of
      Charles the Fourth; and his school resounded with the doctrine,
      that the Roman emperor was the rightful sovereign of the earth,
      from the rising to the setting sun. The contrary opinion was
      condemned, not as an error, but as a heresy, since even the
      gospel had pronounced, “And there went forth a decree from Caesar
      Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.” 154

      153 (return) [ The republic of Europe, with the pope and emperor
      at its head, was never represented with more dignity than in the
      council of Constance. See Lenfant’s History of that assembly.]

      If we annihilate the interval of time and space between Augustus
      and Charles, strong and striking will be the contrast between the
      two Caesars; the Bohemian who concealed his weakness under the
      mask of ostentation, and the Roman, who disguised his strength
      under the semblance of modesty. At the head of his victorious
      legions, in his reign over the sea and land, from the Nile and
      Euphrates to the Atlantic Ocean, Augustus professed himself the
      servant of the state and the equal of his fellow-citizens. The
      conqueror of Rome and her provinces assumed a popular and legal
      form of a censor, a consul, and a tribune. His will was the law
      of mankind, but in the declaration of his laws he borrowed the
      voice of the senate and people; and from their decrees their
      master accepted and renewed his temporary commission to
      administer the republic. In his dress, his domestics, 155 his
      titles, in all the offices of social life, Augustus maintained
      the character of a private Roman; and his most artful flatterers
      respected the secret of his absolute and perpetual monarchy.

      155 (return) [ Six thousand urns have been discovered of the
      slaves and freedmen of Augustus and Livia. So minute was the
      division of office, that one slave was appointed to weigh the
      wool which was spun by the empress’s maids, another for the care
      of her lap-dog, &c., (Camera Sepolchrale, by Bianchini. Extract
      of his work in the Bibliotheque Italique, tom. iv. p. 175. His
      Eloge, by Fontenelle, tom. vi. p. 356.) But these servants were
      of the same rank, and possibly not more numerous than those of
      Pollio or Lentulus. They only prove the general riches of the
      city.]
