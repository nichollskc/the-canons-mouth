FRENCH REVOLUTION,

AS IT APPEARED TO ENTHUSIASTS AT ITS COMMENCEMENT

REPRINTED FROM 'THE FRIEND'


Composed 1805.--Published 1809


[An extract from the long poem on my own poetical education. It was
first published by Coleridge in his 'Friend', which is the reason of its
having had a place in every edition of my poems since.--I. F.]

These lines appeared first in 'The Friend', No. 11, October 26, 1809, p.
163. They afterwards found a place amongst the "Poems of the
Imagination," in all the collective editions from 1815 onwards. They are
part of the eleventh book of 'The Prelude', entitled "France--
(concluded)," ll. 105-144. Wordsworth gives the date 1805, but these
lines possibly belong to the year 1804.--Ed.




  Oh! pleasant exercise of hope and joy!
  For mighty were [1] the auxiliars which then stood
  Upon our side, we [2] who were strong in love!
  Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,
  But to be young was very heaven!--Oh! times,                     5
  In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways
  Of custom, law, and statute, took at once
  The attraction of a country in romance!
  When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights,
  When most intent on making of herself                           10
  A prime Enchantress [3]--to assist the work,
  Which then was going forward in her name!
  Not favoured spots alone, but the whole earth,
  The beauty wore of promise, that which sets
  (As at some moment might not be unfelt [4]                      15
  Among the bowers of paradise itself)
  The budding rose above the rose full blown.
  What temper at the prospect did not wake
  To happiness unthought of? The inert
  Were roused, and lively natures rapt away!                      20
  They who had fed their childhood upon dreams,
  The playfellows of fancy, who had made
  All powers of swiftness, subtilty, and strength
  Their ministers,--who in lordly wise had stirred [5]
  Among the grandest objects of the sense,                        25
  And dealt [6] with whatsoever they found there
  As if they had within some lurking right
  To wield it;--they, too, who, of gentle mood,
  Had watched all gentle motions, and to these
  Had fitted their own thoughts, schemers more mild,              30
  And in the region of their peaceful selves;--
  Now was it that both [7] found, the meek and lofty
  Did both find, helpers to their heart's desire,
  And stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish;
  Were called upon to exercise their skill,                       35
  Not in Utopia, subterranean [8] fields,
  Or some secreted island, Heaven knows where!
  But in the very world, which is the world
  Of all of us,--the place where in the end
  We find our happiness, or not at all!                           40

Compare Coleridge's remarks in 'The Friend', vol. ii. p. 38, before
quoting this poem,

  "My feelings and imagination did not remain unkindled in this general
  conflagration; and I confess I should be more inclined to be ashamed
  than proud of myself if they had! I was a sharer in the general
  vortex, though my little world described the path of its revolution in
  an orbit of its own," etc.

ODE TO DUTY


Composed 1805.--Published 1807


  "Jam non consilio bonus, sed more eò perductus, ut non tantum rectè
  facere possim, sed nisi rectè facere non possim." [A]

[This Ode is on the model of Gray's 'Ode to Adversity', which
is copied from Horace's Ode to Fortune. Many and many a
time have I been twitted by my wife and sister for having
forgotten this dedication of myself to the stern law-giver.
Transgressor indeed I have been from hour to hour, from day
to day: I would fain hope, however, not more flagrantly, or
in a worse way than most of my tuneful brethren. But these
last words are in a wrong strain. We should be rigorous to
ourselves, and forbearing, if not indulgent, to others; and, if
we make comparison at all, it ought to be with those who have
morally excelled us.--I. F.]

In pencil on the MS.,

  "But is not the first stanza of Gray's from a chorus of Æschylus? And
  is not Horace's Ode also modelled on the Greek?"

This poem was placed by Wordsworth among his "Poems of Sentiment and
Reflection."--Ed.




  Stern Daughter of the Voice of God!
  O Duty! if that name thou love
  Who art a light to guide, a rod
  To check the erring, and reprove;
  Thou, who art victory and law                                        5
  When empty terrors overawe;
  From vain temptations dost set free;
  And calm'st the weary strife of frail humanity! [1]

  There are who ask not if thine eye
  Be on them; who, in love and truth,                                 10
  Where no misgiving is, rely
  Upon the genial sense of youth: [B]
  Glad Hearts! without reproach or blot;
  Who do thy work, [2] and know it not:
  Oh, if through confidence misplaced                                 15
  They fail, thy saving arms, dread Power! around them cast. [3]

  Serene will be our days and bright,
  And happy will our nature be,
  When love is an unerring light,
  And joy its own security.                                           20
  And they a blissful course may hold
  Even now, who, not unwisely bold, [4]
  Live in the spirit of this creed;
  Yet seek thy firm support, [5] according to their need.

  I, loving freedom, and untried;                                     25
  No sport of every random gust,
  Yet being to myself a guide,
  Too blindly have reposed my trust:
  And oft, when in my heart was heard
  Thy timely mandate, I deferred                                      30
  The task, in smoother walks to stray; [6]
  But thee I now [7] would serve more strictly, if I may.

  Through no disturbance of my soul,
  Or strong compunction in me wrought,
  I supplicate for thy control;                                       35
  But in the quietness of thought:
  Me this unchartered freedom tires; [C]
  I feel the weight of chance-desires:
  My hopes no more must change their name,
  I long for a repose that [8] ever is the same.                      40
  [9]
  Stern Lawgiver! yet thou dost wear
  The Godhead's most benignant grace;
  Nor know we any thing so [10] fair
  As is the smile upon thy face: [D]
  Flowers laugh before thee on their beds                             45
  And fragrance in thy footing treads; [E]
  Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong;
  And the most ancient heavens, through Thee, are fresh and strong.

  To humbler functions, awful Power!
  I call thee: I myself commend                                       50
  Unto thy guidance from this hour;
  Oh, let my weakness have an end!
  Give unto me, made lowly wise,
  The spirit of self-sacrifice;
  The confidence of reason give;                                      55
  And in the light of truth thy Bondman let me live! [F]

Mr. J. R. Tutin has supplied me with the text of a proof copy of the
sheets of the edition of 1807, which was cancelled by Wordsworth, in
which the following stanzas take the place of the first four of that
edition:


  'There are who tread a blameless way
  In purity, and love, and truth,
  Though resting on no better stay
  Than on the genial sense of youth:
  Glad Hearts! without reproach or blot;
  Who do the right, and know it not:
  May joy be theirs while life shall last
  And may a genial sense remain, when youth is past.

  Serene would be our days and bright;
  And happy would our nature be;
  If Love were an unerring light;
  And Joy its own security.
  And bless'd are they who in the main,
  This creed, even now, do entertain,
  Do in this spirit live; yet know
  That Man hath other hopes; strength which elsewhere must grow.

  I, loving freedom, and untried;
  No sport of every random gust,
  Yet being to myself a guide,
  Too blindly have reposed my trust;
  Resolv'd that nothing e'er should press
  Upon my present happiness,
  I shov'd unwelcome tasks away:
  But henceforth I would serve; and strictly if I may.

  O Power of DUTY! sent from God
  To enforce on earth his high behest,
  And keep us faithful to the road
  Which conscience hath pronounc'd the best:
  Thou, who art Victory and Law
  When empty terrors overawe;
  From vain temptations dost set free,
  From Strife, and from Despair, a glorious Ministry! [G]'

stanza was transcribed by Coleridge.--Ed.]

TO A SKY-LARK


Composed 1805.--Published 1807


[Rydal Mount, 1825. [A]--I. F.]

In pencil opposite,

  "Where there are no skylarks; but the poet is everywhere."

In the edition of 1807 this is No. 2 of the "Poems, composed during a
Tour, chiefly on foot." [B] In 1815 it became one of the "Poems of the
Fancy."--Ed.




  Up with me! up with me into the clouds!
      For thy song, Lark, is strong;
  Up with me, up with me into the clouds!
        Singing, singing,
  With clouds and sky [1] about thee ringing,                        5
      Lift me, guide me till I find
  That spot which seems so to thy mind!

  I have walked through wildernesses dreary,
  And [2] to-day my heart is weary;
  Had I now the wings [3] of a Faery,                               10
  Up to thee would I fly.
  There is madness about thee, and joy divine
  In that song of thine;
  Lift me, guide me high and high [4]
  To thy banqueting-place in the sky.                               15

          Joyous as morning, [5]
  Thou art laughing and scorning;
  Thou hast a nest for thy love and thy rest,
  And, though little troubled with sloth,
  Drunken Lark! thou would'st be loth                               20
  To be such a traveller as I.
  Happy, happy Liver,
  With a soul as strong as a mountain river
  Pouring out praise to the almighty Giver,
      Joy and jollity be with us both!                              25

  Alas! my journey, rugged and uneven,
  Through prickly moors or dusty ways must wind;
  But hearing thee, or others of thy kind,
  As full of gladness and as free of heaven,
  I, with my fate contented, will plod on,                          30
  And hope for higher raptures, when life's day is done. [6]

FIDELITY


Composed 1805.--Published 1807


[The young man whose death gave occasion to this poem was named Charles
Gough, and had come early in the spring to Patterdale for the sake of
angling. While attempting to cross over Helvellyn to Grasmere he slipped
from a steep part of the rock where the ice was not thawed, and
perished. His body was discovered as described in this poem. Walter
Scott heard of the accident, and both he and I, without either of us
knowing that the other had taken up the subject, each wrote a poem in
admiration of the dog's fidelity. His contains a most beautiful stanza:

  "How long did'st thou think that his silence was slumber!
  When the wind waved his garment how oft did'st thou start!"

I will add that the sentiment in the last four lines of the last stanza
of my verses was uttered by a shepherd with such exactness, that a
traveller, who afterwards reported his account in print, was induced to
question the man whether he had read them, which he had not.--I. F.]

One of the "Poems of Sentiment and Reflection."--Ed.




  A barking sound the Shepherd hears,
  A cry as of a dog or fox;
  He halts--and searches with his eyes
  Among the scattered rocks:
  And now at distance can discern                          5
  A stirring in a brake of fern;
  And instantly a dog is seen,
  Glancing through that covert green. [1]

  The Dog is not of mountain breed;
  Its motions, too, are wild and shy;                     10
  With something, as the Shepherd thinks,
  Unusual in its cry:
  Nor is there any one in sight
  All round, in hollow or on height;
  Nor shout, nor whistle strikes his ear;                 15
  What is the creature doing here?

  It was a cove, a huge recess,
  That keeps, till June, December's snow;
  A lofty precipice in front,
  A silent tarn [A] below! [B]                            20
  Far in the bosom of Helvellyn,
  Remote from public road or dwelling,
  Pathway, or cultivated land;
  From trace of human foot or hand.

  There sometimes doth [2] a leaping fish                 25
  Send through the tarn a lonely cheer;
  The crags repeat the raven's croak, [C]
  In symphony austere;
  Thither the rainbow comes--the cloud--
  And mists that spread the flying shroud;                30
  And sunbeams; and the sounding blast,
  That, if it could, would hurry past;
  But that enormous barrier holds [3] it fast.

  Not free from boding thoughts, [4] a while
  The Shepherd stood; then makes his way                  35
  O'er rocks and stones, following the Dog [5]
  As quickly as he may;
  Nor far had gone before he found
  A human skeleton on the ground;
  The appalled Discoverer with a sigh [6]                 40
  Looks round, to learn the history.

  From those abrupt and perilous rocks
  The Man had fallen, that place of fear!
  At length upon the Shepherd's mind
  It breaks, and all is clear:                            45
  He instantly recalled the name, [7]
  And who he was, and whence he came;
  Remembered, too, the very day
  On which the Traveller passed this way.

  But hear a wonder, for whose sake                       50
  This lamentable tale I tell! [8]
  A lasting monument of words
  This wonder merits well.
  The Dog, which still was hovering nigh,
  Repeating the same timid cry,                           55
  This Dog, had been through three months' space
  A dweller in that savage place.

  Yes, proof was plain that, since the day
  When this ill-fated Traveller died, [9]
  The Dog had watched about the spot,                     60
  Or by his master's side:
  How nourished here through such long time
  He knows, who gave that love sublime;
  And gave that strength of feeling, great
  Above all human estimate!                               65

FOOTNOTES ON THE TEXT

[Footnote A: Tarn is a _small_ Mere or Lake mostly high up in the
mountains,--W. W.]

[Footnote B: Compare the reference to Helvellyn, and its "deep coves,
shaped by skeleton arms," in the 'Musings near Aquapendente' (1837).
Wordsworth here describes Red Tarn, under Helvellyn, to the east; but
Charles Gough was killed on the Kepplecove side of Swirell Edge, and not
at Red Tarn. Bishop Watson of Llandaff, writing to Hayley (see
'Anecdotes of the Life of Bishop Watson', p. 440), writes about Charles
Gouche (evidently Gough). He had been lodging at "the Cherry Inn," near
Wytheburn, sometime before his death.--Ed.]


[Footnote C: Compare 'The Excursion', book iv. ll. 1185-94.--Ed.]



Thomas Wilkinson--referred to in the notes to 'The Solitary Reaper',
vol. ii. pp. 399, 400, and the verses 'To the Spade of a Friend', in
vol. iv.--alludes to this incident at some length in his poem, 'Emont
Vale'. Wilkinson attended the funeral of young Gough, and writes of the
incident with feeling, but without inspiration. Gough perished early in
April, and his body was not found till July 22nd, 1805. A reference to
his fate will be found in Lockhart's 'Life of Scott' (vol. ii. p. 274);
also in a letter of Mr. Luff of Patterdale, to his wife, July 23rd,
1805. Henry Crabb Robinson records (see his 'Diary, Reminiscences',
etc., vol. ii. p. 25) a conversation with Wordsworth, in which he said
of this poem, that "he purposely made the narrative as prosaic as
possible, in order that no discredit might be thrown on the truth of the
incident."--Ed.

INCIDENT CHARACTERISTIC OF A FAVOURITE DOG [A]

[This dog I knew well. It belonged to Mrs. Wordsworth's brother, Mr.
Thomas Hutchinson, who then lived at Sockburn-on-the-Tees, a beautiful
retired situation, where I used to visit him and his sisters before my
marriage. My sister and I spent many months there after my return from
Germany in 1799--I. F.]

One of the "Poems of Sentiment and Reflection."--Ed.




  On his morning rounds the Master
  Goes to learn how all things fare;
  Searches pasture after pasture,
  Sheep and cattle eyes with care;
  And, for silence or for talk,                                     5
  He hath comrades in his walk;
  Four dogs, each pair of different breed,
  Distinguished two for scent, and two for speed.

  See a hare before him started!
--Off they fly in earnest chase;                                 10
  Every dog is eager-hearted,
  All the four are in the race:
  And the hare whom they pursue,
  Knows from instinct [1] what to do;
  Her hope is near: no turn she makes;                             15
  But, like an arrow, to the river takes.

  Deep the river was, and crusted
  Thinly by a one night's frost;
  But the nimble Hare hath trusted
  To the ice, and safely crost; so                                 20
  She hath crost, and without heed
  All are following at full speed,
  When, lo! the ice, so thinly spread,
  Breaks--and the greyhound, DART, is over-head!

  Better fate have PRINCE and SWALLOW--25
  See them cleaving to the sport!
  MUSIC has no heart to follow,
  Little MUSIC, she stops short.
  She hath neither wish nor heart,
  Hers is now another part:                                        30
  A loving creature she, and brave!
  And fondly strives [2] her struggling friend to save.

  From the brink her paws she stretches,
  Very hands as you would say!
  And afflicting moans she fetches,                                35
  As he breaks the ice away.
  For herself she hath no fears,--
  Him alone she sees and hears,--
  Makes efforts with complainings; nor gives o'er
  Until her fellow sinks to re-appear no more. [3]                 40

TRIBUTE TO THE MEMORY OF THE SAME DOG


Composed 1805.--Published 1807


[Was written at the same time, 1805. The Dog Music died, aged and blind,
by falling into a draw-well at Gallow] Hill, to the great grief of the
family of the Hutchinsons, who, as has been before mentioned, had
removed to that place from Sockburn.--I. F.]

One of the "Poems of Sentiment and Reflection."--Ed.




  Lie [1] here, without a record of thy worth,
  Beneath a [2] covering of the common earth!
  It is not from unwillingness to praise,
  Or want of love, that here no Stone we raise;
  More thou deserv'st; but _this_ man gives to man,                    5
  Brother to brother, _this_ is all we can.
  Yet [3] they to whom thy virtues made thee dear
  Shall find thee through all changes of the year:
  This Oak points out thy grave; the silent tree
  Will gladly stand a monument of thee.                               10

    We grieved for thee, and wished thy end were past; [4]
  And willingly have laid thee here at last:
  For thou hadst lived till every thing that cheers
  In thee had yielded to the weight of years;
  Extreme old age had wasted thee away,                               15
  And left thee but a glimmering of the day;
  Thy ears were deaf, and feeble were thy knees,--
  I saw thee stagger in the summer breeze,
  Too weak to stand against its sportive breath,
  And ready for the gentlest stroke of death.                         20
  It came, and we were glad; yet tears were shed;
  Both man and woman wept when thou wert dead;
  Not only for a thousand thoughts that were,
  Old household thoughts, in which thou hadst thy share;
  But for some precious boons vouchsafed to thee,                     25
  Found scarcely any where in like degree!
  For love, that comes wherever life and sense
  Are given by God, in thee was most intense; [5]
  A chain of heart, a feeling of the mind,
  A tender sympathy, which did thee bind                              30
  Not only to us Men, but to thy Kind:
  Yea, for thy fellow-brutes in thee we saw
  A soul [6] of love, love's intellectual law:--
  Hence, if we wept, it was not done in shame;
  Our tears from passion and from reason came,                        35
  And, therefore, shalt thou be an honoured name!

TO THE DAISY (#4)


Composed 1805.--Published 1815


Placed by Wordsworth among his "Epitaphs and Elegiac Pieces."--Ed.




  Sweet Flower! belike one day to have
  A place upon thy Poet's grave,
  I welcome thee once more:
  But He, who was on land, at sea,
  My Brother, too, in loving thee,                        5
  Although he loved more silently,
  Sleeps by his native shore.

  Ah! hopeful, hopeful was the day
  When to that Ship he bent his way,
  To govern and to guide:                                10
  His wish was gained: a little time
  Would bring him back in manhood's prime
  And free for life, these hills to climb;
  With all his wants supplied.

  And full of hope day followed day                      15
  While that stout Ship at anchor lay
  Beside the shores of Wight;
  The May had then made all things green;
  And, floating there, in pomp serene,
  That Ship was goodly to be seen,                       20
  His pride and his delight!

  Yet then, when called ashore, he sought
  The tender peace of rural thought:
  In more than happy mood
  To your abodes, bright daisy Flowers!                  25
  He then would steal at leisure hours,
  And loved you glittering in your bowers,
  A starry multitude.

  But hark the word!--the ship is gone;--
  Returns from her long course: [1]--anon                30
  Sets sail:--in season due,
  Once more on English earth they stand:
  But, when a third time from the land
  They parted, sorrow was at hand
  For Him and for his crew.                              35

  Ill-fated Vessel!--ghastly shock!
  --At length delivered from the rock,
  The deep she hath regained;
  And through the stormy night they steer;
  Labouring for life, in hope and fear,                  40
  To reach a safer shore [2]--how near,
  Yet not to be attained!

  "Silence!" the brave Commander cried;
  To that calm word a shriek replied,
  It was the last death-shriek.                          45
  --A few (my soul oft sees that sight)
  Survive upon the tall mast's height; [3]
  But one dear remnant of the night--
  For Him in vain I seek.

  Six weeks beneath the moving sea                       50
  He lay in slumber quietly;
  Unforced by wind or wave
  To quit the Ship for which he died,
  (All claims of duty satisfied;)
  And there they found him at her side;                  55
  And bore him to the grave.

  Vain service! yet not vainly done
  For this, if other end were none,
  That He, who had been cast
  Upon a way of life unmeet                              60
  For such a gentle Soul and sweet,
  Should find an undisturbed retreat
  Near what he loved, at last--

  That neighbourhood of grove and field
  To Him a resting-place should yield,                   65
  A meek man and a brave!
  The birds shall sing and ocean make
  A mournful murmur for _his_ sake;
  And Thou, sweet Flower, shalt sleep and wake
  Upon his senseless grave. [4]                          70

ELEGIAC STANZAS [A]

SUGGESTED BY A PICTURE OF PEELE CASTLE, IN A STORM,
PAINTED BY SIR GEORGE BEAUMONT


Composed 1805.--Published 1807


[Sir George Beaumont painted two pictures of this subject, one of which
he gave to Mrs. Wordsworth, saying she ought to have it; but Lady
Beaumont interfered, and after Sir George's death she gave it to Sir
Uvedale Price, at whose house at Foxley I have seen it.--I. F.]

Placed by Wordsworth among his "Epitaphs and Elegiac Pieces."--Ed.




  I was thy neighbour once, thou rugged Pile!
  Four summer weeks I dwelt in sight of thee:
  I saw thee every day; and all the while
  Thy Form was sleeping on a glassy sea.

  So pure the sky, so quiet was the air!                         5
  So like, so very like, was day to day!
  Whene'er I looked, thy Image still was there;
  It trembled, but it never passed away.

  How perfect was the calm! it seemed no sleep;
  No mood, which season takes away, or brings:                  10
  I could have fancied that the mighty Deep
  Was even the gentlest of all gentle Things.

  Ah! THEN, if mine had been the Painter's hand,
  To express what then I saw; and add the gleam,
  The light that never was, on sea or land,                     15
  The consecration, and the Poet's dream; [1]

  I would have planted thee, thou hoary Pile
  Amid a world how different from this!
  Beside a sea that could not cease to smile;
  On tranquil land, beneath a sky of bliss.                     20

  Thou shouldst have seemed a treasure-house divine [2]
  Of peaceful years; a chronicle of heaven;--
  Of all the sunbeams that did ever shine
  The very sweetest had to thee been given.

  A Picture had it been of lasting ease,                        25
  Elysian quiet, without toil or strife;
  No motion but the moving tide, a breeze,
  Or merely silent Nature's breathing life.

  Such, in the fond illusion [3] of my heart,
  Such Picture would I at that time have made:                  30
  And seen the soul of truth in every part,
  A stedfast peace that might not be betrayed. [4]

  So once it would have been,--'tis so no more;
  I have submitted to a new control:
  A power is gone, which nothing can restore;                   35
  A deep distress hath humanised my Soul.

  Not for a moment could I now behold
  A smiling sea, and be what I have been:
  The feeling of my loss will ne'er be old;
  This, which I know, I speak with mind serene.                 40

  Then, Beaumont, Friend! who would have been the Friend,
  If he had lived, of Him whom I deplore,
  This work of thine I blame not, but commend;
  This sea in anger, and that dismal shore.

  O 'tis a passionate Work!--yet wise and well,                 45
  Well chosen is the spirit that is here;
  That Hulk which labours in the deadly swell,
  This rueful sky, this pageantry of fear!

  And this huge Castle, standing here sublime,
  1 love to see the look with which it braves,                  50
  Cased in the unfeeling armour of old time,
  The lightning, the fierce wind, and trampling waves.

  Farewell, farewell the heart that lives alone,
  Housed in a dream, at distance from the Kind!
  Such happiness, wherever it be known,                         55
  Is to be pitied; for 'tis surely blind.

  But welcome fortitude, and patient cheer,
  And frequent sights of what is to be borne!
  Such sights, or worse, as are before me here.--
  Not without hope we suffer and we mourn.                      60

SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT

[Sub-Footnote a: Many years ago Principal Shairp wrote to me,

  "Have you noted how the two lines, 'The light that never was,' etc.,
  stood in the edition of 1827? I know no other such instance of a
  change from commonplace to perfection of ideality."

The Principal had not remembered at the time that the "perfection of
ideality" was in the original edition of 1807. The curious thing is that
the prosaic version of 1820 and 1827 ever took its place. Wordsworth's
return to his original reading was one of the wisest changes he
introduced into the text of 1832.--Ed.]



There is a Peele Castle, on a small rocky island, close to the town of
Peele, in the Isle of Man; yet separated from it, much as St. Michael's
Mount in Cornwall is separated from the mainland. This castle was
believed by many to be the one which Sir George painted, and which gave
rise to the foregoing lines. I visited it in 1879, being then ignorant
that any other Peele Castle existed; and although, the day being calm,
and the season summer, I thought Sir George had idealized his subject
much--(as I had just left Coleorton, where the picture still exists)--I
accepted the customary opinion. But I am now convinced, both from the
testimony of the Arnold family, [B] and as the result of a visit to Piel
Castle, near Barrow in Furness, that Wordsworth refers to it. The late
Bishop of Lincoln, in his uncle's 'Memoirs' (vol. i. p. 299), quotes the
line

  "I was thy neighbour once, thou rugged pile,"

and adds,

  "He had spent four weeks there of a college summer vacation at the
  house of his cousin, Mr. Barker."

This house was at Rampside, the village opposite Piel, on the coast of
Lancashire. The "rugged pile," too, now "cased in the unfeeling armour
of old time," painted by Beaumont, is obviously this Piel Castle near
Barrow. I took the engraving of his picture with me, when visiting it:
and although Sir George--after the manner of landscape artists of his
day--took many liberties with his subjects, it is apparent that it was
this, and not Peele Castle in Mona, that he painted. The "four summer
weeks" referred to in the first stanza, were those spent at Piel during
the year 1794.

With the last verse of these 'Elegiac Stanzas' compare stanzas ten and
eleven of the 'Ode, Intimations of Immortality', vol. viii.

One of the two pictures of "Peele Castle in a Storm"--engraved by S. W.
Reynolds, and published in the editions of Wordsworth's poems of 1815
and 1820--is still in the Beaumont Gallery at Coleorton Hall.

The poem is so memorable that I have arranged to make this picture of
"Peele Castle in a Storm," the vignette to vol. xv. of this edition. It
deserves to be noted that it was to the pleading of Barron Field that we
owe the restoration of the original line of 1807,

  'The light that never was, on sea or land.'

An interesting account of Piel Castle will be found in Hearne and
Byrne's 'Antiquities'. It was built by the Abbot of Furness in the first
year of the reign of Edward III.--Ed.


[Footnote B: Miss Arnold wrote to me, in December 1893:

  "I have never doubted that the Peele Castle of Wordsworth is the Piel
  off Walney Island. I know that my brother Matthew so believed, and I
  went with him some years ago from Furness Abbey over to Piel, visiting
  it as the subject of the picture and the poem."

ELEGIAC VERSES,

IN MEMORY OF MY BROTHER, JOHN WORDSWORTH, COMMANDER OF THE E. I.
COMPANY'S SHIP, 'THE EARL OF ABERGAVENNY', IN WHICH HE PERISHED BY
CALAMITOUS SHIPWRECK, FEB. 6TH, 1805.


Composed near the Mountain track, that leads from Grasmere through
Grisdale Hawes, where it descends towards Patterdale.

Composed 1805.--Published 1842

[  "Here did we stop; and here looked round,
   While each into himself descends."

The point is two or three yards below the outlet of Grisedale Tarn, on a
foot-road by which a horse may pass to Patterdale--a ridge of Helvellyn
on the left, and the summit of Fairfield on the right.--I. F.]

This poem was included among the "Epitaphs and Elegiac Pieces."--Ed.




  I        The Sheep-boy whistled loud, and lo!
           That instant, startled by the shock,
           The Buzzard mounted from the rock
           Deliberate and slow:
           Lord of the air, he took his flight;                   5
           Oh! could he on that woeful night
           Have lent his wing, my Brother dear,
           For one poor moment's space to Thee,
           And all who struggled with the Sea,
           When safety was so near.                              10

  II       Thus in the weakness of my heart
           I spoke (but let that pang be still)
           When rising from the rock at will,
           I saw the Bird depart.
           And let me calmly bless the Power                     15
           That meets me in this unknown Flower,
           Affecting type of him I mourn!
           With calmness suffer and believe,
           And grieve, and know that I must grieve,
           Not cheerless, though forlorn.                        20

  III      Here did we stop; and here looked round
           While each into himself descends,
           For that last thought of parting Friends
           That is not to be found.
           Hidden was Grasmere Vale from sight,                  25
           Our home and his, his heart's delight,
           His quiet heart's selected home.
           But time before him melts away,
           And he hath feeling of a day
           Of blessedness to come.                               30

  IV       Full soon in sorrow did I weep,
           Taught that the mutual hope was dust,
           In sorrow, but for higher trust,
           How miserably deep!
           All vanished in a single word,                        35
           A breath, a sound, and scarcely heard.
           Sea--Ship--drowned--Shipwreck--so it came,
           The meek, the brave, the good, was gone;
           He who had been our living John
           Was nothing but a name.                               40

  V        That was indeed a parting! oh,
           Glad am I, glad that it is past;
           For there were some on whom it cast
           Unutterable woe.
           But they as well as I have gains;--45
           From many a humble source, to pains
           Like these, there comes a mild release;
           Even here I feel it, even this Plant
           Is in its beauty ministrant
           To comfort and to peace.                              50

  VI       He would have loved thy modest grace,
           Meek Flower! To Him I would have said,
           "It grows upon its native bed
           Beside our Parting-place;
           There, cleaving to the ground, it lies                55
           With multitude of purple eyes,
           Spangling a cushion green like moss;
           But we will see it, joyful tide!
           Some day, to see it in its pride,
           The mountain will we cross."                          60

  VII--Brother and friend, if verse of mine
           Have power to make thy virtues known,
           Here let a monumental Stone
           Stand--sacred as a Shrine;
           And to the few who pass this way,                     65
           Traveller or Shepherd, let it say,
           Long as these mighty rocks endure,--
           Oh do not Thou too fondly brood,
           Although deserving of all good,
           On any earthly hope, however pure! [A]                70

The note is as follows:

  "Moss Campion ('Silene acaulis'). This most beautiful plant is scarce
  in England, though it is found in great abundance upon the mountains
  of Scotland. The first specimen I ever saw of it in its native bed was
  singularly fine, the tuft or cushion being at least eight inches
  diameter, and the root proportionably thick. I have only met with it
  in two places among our mountains, in both of which I have since
  sought for it in vain.

  Botanists will not, I hope, take it ill, if I caution them against
  carrying off inconsiderately rare and beautiful plants. This has often
  been done, particularly from Ingleborough and other mountains in
  Yorkshire, till the species have totally disappeared, to the great
  regret of lovers of nature living near the places where they
  grew."--W. W. 1842.

This poem underwent no change in successive editions.

At a meeting of "The Wordsworth Society" held at Grasmere, in July 1881,
it was proposed by one of the members, the Rev. H. D. Rawnsley, then
Vicar of Wray, to erect some memorial at the parting-place of the
brothers. The brothers John and William Wordsworth parted at Grisedale
Tarn, on the 29th September 1800. The originator of the idea wrote thus
of it in June 1882:

  "A proposition, made by one of its members to the Wordsworth Society
  when it met in Grasmere in 1881, to mark the spot in the Grisedale
  Pass of Wordsworth's parting from his brother John--and to carry out a
  wish the poet seems to have hinted at in the last of his elegiac
  verses in memory of that parting--is now being put into effect. It has
  been determined, after correspondence with Lord Coleridge, Dr.
  Cradock, Professor Knight, and Mr. Hills, to have inscribed--(on the
  native rock, if possible)--the first four lines of Stanzas III. and
  VII. of these verses:

    'Here did we stop; and here looked round
    While each into himself descends,
    For that last thought of parting Friends
    That is not to be found.
    ...
    Brother and friend, if verse of mine
    Have power to make thy virtues known,
    Here let a monumental Stone
    Stand--sacred as a Shrine.'

  The rock selected is a fine mass, facing the east, on the left of the
  track as one descends from Grisedale Tarn towards Patterdale, and is
  about 100 yards from the tarn. No more suitable one can be found, and
  we have the testimony of Mr. David Richardson of Newcastle, who has
  practical knowledge of engineering, that it is the fittest, both from
  shape and from slight incline of plane.

  It has been proposed to sink a panel in the face of the rock, that so
  the inscription may be slightly protected, and to engrave the letters
  upon the face of the panel thus obtained. But it is not quite certain
  yet that the grain of the rock--volcanic ash--will admit of the
  lettering. If this cannot be carried out, it has been determined to
  have the letters engraved upon a slab of Langdale slate, and imbed it
  in the Grisedale Rock.

  It is believed that the simplicity of the design, the lonely isolation
  of this mountain memorial, will appeal at once

    ' ... to the few who pass this way,
    Traveller or Shepherd.'

  And we in our turn appeal to English tourists who may chance to see
  it, to forego the wish of adding to it, or taking anything from it, by
  engraving their own names; and to let the Monumental Stone stand, as
  the poet wished it might

    ' ... stand, SACRED as a Shrine.'

  We owe great thanks to Mrs. Sturge for first surveying the place, to
  ascertain the possibility of finding a mountain rock sufficiently
  striking in position; to Mr. Richardson, jun., for his etching of the
  rock, upon which the inscription is to be made; to his father for the
  kind trouble he took in the measurement of the said rock; and
  particularly to the seconder of the original proposal, and my
  coadjutor in the task of final selection and superintending the work,
  Mr. W. H. Hills.

  H. D. RAWNSLEY.

  _P. S._--When we came to examine the rock, we found the area for the
  panel less than we had hoped for, owing to certain rock fissures,
  which, by acting as drains for the rainwater on the surface, would
  have much interfered with the durability of the inscription. The
  available space for the panel remains 3 feet 7 in length by 1 foot 9
  inches in depth. Owing to the fineness of the grain of the stone, it
  may be quite possible to letter the native rock; but it has been
  difficult to fix on a style of lettering for the inscription that
  shall be at once in good taste, forcible, and plain. It was proposed
  that the Script type of letter which was made use of in the
  inscription cut on the rock, in the late Mr. Ball's garden grounds
  below the Mount at Rydal, should be adopted; but a final decision has
  been given in favour of a style of lettering which Mrs. Rawnsley has
  designed. The panel is, from its position, certain to attract the eye
  of the wanderer from Patterdale up to the Grisedale Pass.

See the note to 'The Waggoner', p. 112, referring to the Rock of Names,
on the shore of Thirlmere.

The following extract from 'Recollections from 1803 to 1837, with a
Conclusion in 1868, by the Hon. Amelia Murray' (London: Longmans, Green,
and Co. 1868)--refers to the loss of the 'Abergavenny':

  "One morning, coming down early, I saw what I thought was a great big
  ship without any hull. This was the 'Abergavenny', East Indiaman,
  which had sunk with all sails set, hardly three miles from the shore,
  and all on board perished.

  Had any of the crew taken refuge in the main-top, they might have been
  saved; but the bowsprit, which was crowded with human beings, gave a
  lurch into the sea as the ship settled down, and thus all were washed
  off--though the timber appeared again above water when the
  'Abergavenny' touched the ground. The ship had sprung a leak off St.
  Alban's Head; and in spite of pumps, she went to the bottom just
  within reach of safety."    Pp. 12, 13.

A 'Narrative of the loss of the "Earl of Abergavenny" East Indiaman, off
Portland, Feb. 5, 1805', was published in pamphlet form (8vo, 1805), by
Hamilton and Bird, 21 High Street, Islington.

For much in reference to John Wordsworth, which illustrates both these
'Elegiac Verses', and the poem "On the Naming of Places" which follows
them, I must refer to his 'Life' to be published in another volume of
this series; but there is one letter of Dorothy Wordsworth's, written to
her friend Miss Jane Pollard (afterwards Mrs. Marshall), in reference to
her brother's death, which may find a place here. For the use of it I am
indebted to the kindness of Mrs. Marshall's daughter, the Dowager Lady
Monteagle:

  "March 16th, 1805. Grasmere.

  "... It does me good to weep for him, and it does me good to find that
  others weep, and I bless them for it. ... It is with me, when I write,
  as when I am walking out in this vale, once so full of joy. I can turn
  to no object that does not remind me of our loss. I see nothing that
  he would not have loved, and enjoyed.... My consolations rather come
  to me in gusts of feeling, than are the quiet growth of my mind. I
  know it will not always be so. The time will come when the light of
  the setting sun upon these mountain tops will be as heretofore a pure
  joy; not the same _gladness_, that can never be--but yet a joy even
  more tender. It will soothe me to know how happy he would have been,
  could he have seen the same beautiful spectacle.... He was taken away
  in the freshness of his manhood; pure he was, and innocent as a child.
  Never human being was more thoroughly modest, and his courage I need
  not speak of. He was 'seen speaking with apparent cheerfulness to the
  first mate a few minutes before the ship went down;' and when nothing
  more could be done, He said, 'the will of God be done.' I have no
  doubt when he felt that it was out of his power to save his life he
  was as calm as before, if some thought of what we should endure did
  not awaken a pang.... He loved solitude, and he rejoiced in society.
  He would wander alone amongst these hills with his fishing-rod, or led
  on by the mere pleasure of walking, for many hours; or he would walk
  with W. or me, or both of us, and was continually pointing out--with a
  gladness which is seldom seen but in very young people--something
  which perhaps would have escaped our observation; for he had so fine
  an eye that no distinction was unnoticed by him, and so tender a
  feeling that he never noticed anything in vain. Many a time has he
  called out to me at evening to look at the moon or stars, or a cloudy
  sky, or this vale in the quiet moonlight; but the stars and moon were
  his chief delight. He made of them his companions when he was at sea,
  and was never tired of those thoughts which the silence of the night
  fed in him. Then he was so happy by the fireside. Any little business
  of the house interested him. He loved our cottage. He helped us to
  furnish it, and to make the garden. Trees are growing now which he
  planted.... He staid with us till the 29th of September, having come
  to us about the end of January. During that time Mary Hutchinson--now
  Mary Wordsworth--staid with us six weeks. John used to walk with her
  everywhere, and they were exceedingly attached to each other; so my
  poor sister mourns with us, not merely because we have lost one who
  was so dear to William and me, but from tender love to John and an
  intimate knowledge of him. Her hopes as well as ours were fixed on
  John.... I can think of nothing but of our departed Brother, yet I am
  very tranquil to-day. I honour him, and love him, and glory in his
  memory...."

Southey, writing to his friend, C. W. W. Wynn, on the 3rd of April 1805,
says:

  "DEAR WYNN,

  I have been grievously shocked this evening by the loss of the
  'Abergavenny', of which Wordsworth's brother was captain. Of course
  the news came flying up to us from all quarters, and it has disordered
  me from head to foot. At such circumstances I believe we feel as much
  for others as for ourselves; just as a violent blow occasions the same
  pain as a wound, and he who breaks his shin feels as acutely at the
  moment as the man whose leg is shot off. In fact, I am writing to you
  merely because this dreadful shipwreck has left me utterly unable to
  do anything else. It is the heaviest calamity Wordsworth has ever
  experienced, and in all probability I shall have to communicate it to
  him, as he will very likely be here before the tidings can reach him.
  What renders any near loss of this kind so peculiarly distressing is,
  that the recollection is perpetually freshened when any like event
  occurs, by the mere mention of shipwreck, or the sound of the wind. Of
  all deaths it is the most dreadful, from the circumstances of terror
  which accompany it...."

(See 'The Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey', vol. ii. p. 321.)

The following is part of a letter from Mary Lamb to Dorothy Wordsworth
on the same subject. It is undated:

  "MY DEAR MISS WORDSWORTH,--

  I wished to tell you that you would one day feel the kind of peaceful
  state of mind and sweet memory of the dead, which you so happily
  describe, as now almost begun; but I felt that it was improper, and
  most grating to the feelings of the afflicted, to say to them that the
  memory of their affliction would in time become a constant part, not
  only of their dreams, but of their most wakeful sense of happiness.
  That you would see every object with and through your lost brother,
  and that that would at last become a real and everlasting source of
  comfort to you, I felt, and well knew, from my own experience in
  sorrow; but till you yourself began to feel this, I did not dare to
  tell you so; but I send you some poor lines, which I wrote under this
  conviction of mind, and before I heard Coleridge was returning home.

  ...

    "Why is he wandering on the sea?--
    Coleridge should now with Wordsworth be.
    By slow degrees he'd steal away
    Their woes, and gently bring a ray
    (So happily he'd time relief,)
    Of comfort from their very grief.
    He'd tell them that their brother dead,
    When years have passed o'er their head,
    Will be remembered with such holy,
    True and tender melancholy,
    That ever this lost brother John
    Will be their heart's companion.
    His voice they'll always hear,
      His face they'll always see;
    There's naught in life so sweet
      As such a memory."

ii. pp. 233, 234.)--Ed.

"WHEN, TO THE ATTRACTIONS OF THE BUSY WORLD"


Composed 1800 to 1805.--Published 1815


[The grove still exists; but the plantation has been walled in, and is
not so accessible as when my brother John wore the path in the manner
here described. The grove was a favourite haunt with us all while we
lived at Town-end.--I. F.]

This was No. VI. of the "Poems on the Naming of Places." For several
suggested changes in MS. see Appendix I. p. 385.--Ed.




  When, to the attractions of the busy world,
  Preferring studious leisure, I had chosen
  A habitation in this peaceful Vale,
  Sharp season followed of continual storm
  In deepest winter; and, from week to week,                         5
  Pathway, and lane, and public road, were clogged
  With frequent showers of snow. Upon a hill
  At a short distance from my cottage, stands
  A stately Fir-grove, whither I was wont
  To hasten, for I found, beneath the roof                          10
  Of that perennial shade, a cloistral place
  Of refuge, with an unincumbered floor.
  Here, in safe covert, on the shallow snow,
  And, sometimes, on a speck of visible earth,
  The redbreast near me hopped; nor was I loth                      15
  To sympathise with vulgar coppice birds
  That, for protection from the nipping blast,
  Hither repaired.--A single beech-tree grew
  Within this grove of firs! and, on the fork
  Of that one beech, appeared a thrush's nest;                      20
  A last year's nest, conspicuously built
  At such small elevation from the ground
  As gave sure sign that they, who in that house
  Of nature and of love had made their home
  Amid the fir-trees, all the summer long                           25
  Dwelt in a tranquil spot. And oftentimes,
  A few sheep, stragglers from some mountain-flock,
  Would watch my motions with suspicious stare,
  From the remotest outskirts of the grove,--
  Some nook where they had made their final stand,                  30
  Huddling together from two fears--the fear
  Of me and of the storm. Full many an hour
  Here did I lose. But in this grove the trees
  Had been so thickly planted, and had thriven
  In such perplexed and intricate array;                            35
  That vainly did I seek, beneath [1] their stems
  A length of open space, where to and fro
  My feet might move without concern or care;
  And, baffled thus, though earth from day to day
  Was fettered, and the air by storm disturbed,                     40
  I ceased the shelter to frequent, [2]--and prized,
  Less than I wished to prize, that calm recess.

    The snows dissolved, and genial Spring returned
  To clothe the fields with verdure. Other haunts
  Meanwhile were mine; till, one bright April day,                  45
  By chance retiring from the glare of noon
  To this forsaken covert, there I found
  A hoary pathway traced between the trees,
  And winding on with such an easy line
  Along a natural opening, that I stood                             50
  Much wondering how I could have sought in vain [3]
  For what was now so obvious. [4] To abide,
  For an allotted interval of ease,
  Under my cottage-roof, had gladly come
  From the wild sea a cherished Visitant; [5]                       55
  And with the sight of this same path--begun,
  Begun and ended, in the shady grove, [6]
  Pleasant conviction flashed upon my mind [7]
  That, to this opportune recess allured,
  He had surveyed it with a finer eye,                              60
  A heart more wakeful; and had worn the track [8]
  By pacing here, unwearied and alone, [A]
  In that habitual restlessness of foot
  That haunts the Sailor measuring [9] o'er and o'er
  His short domain upon the vessel's deck,                          65
  While she pursues her course [10] through the dreary sea.

  When thou hadst quitted Esthwaite's pleasant shore,
  And taken thy first leave of those green hills
  And rocks that were the play-ground of thy youth,
  Year followed year, my Brother! and we two,                       70
  Conversing not, knew little in what mould
  Each other's mind was fashioned; [11] and at length
  When once again we met in Grasmere Vale,
  Between us there was little other bond
  Than common feelings of fraternal love.                           75
  But thou, a School-boy, to the sea hadst carried
  Undying recollections; Nature there
  Was with thee; she, who loved us both, she still
  Was with thee; and even so didst thou become
  A _silent_ Poet; from the solitude                                80
  Of the vast sea didst bring a watchful heart
  Still couchant, an inevitable ear,
  And an eye practised like a blind man's touch.
--Back to the joyless Ocean thou art gone;
  Nor from this vestige of thy musing hours                         85
  Could I withhold thy honoured name,--and now
  I love the fir-grove [12] with a perfect love.
  Thither do I withdraw when cloudless suns
  Shine hot, or wind blows troublesome and strong;
  And there I sit at evening, when the steep                        90
  Of Silver-how, and Grasmere's peaceful [13] lake,
  And one green island, gleam between the stems
  Of the dark firs, a visionary scene!
  And, while I gaze upon the spectacle
  Of clouded splendour, on this dream-like sight                    95
  Of solemn loveliness, I think on thee,
  My Brother, and on all which thou hast lost.
  Nor seldom, if I rightly guess, while Thou,
  Muttering the verses which I muttered first
  Among the mountains, through the midnight watch                  100
  Art pacing thoughtfully [14] the vessel's deck
  In some far region, here, while o'er my head,
  At every impulse of the moving breeze,
  The fir-grove murmurs with a sea-like sound, [B]
  Alone I tread this path;--for aught I know,                      105
  Timing my steps to thine; and, with a store
  Of undistinguishable sympathies,
  Mingling most earnest wishes for the day
  When we, and others whom we love, shall meet
  A second time, in Grasmere's happy Vale.                         110

SUB-FOOTNOTE ON THE TEXT

[Sub-Footnote a: In the late Lord Coleridge's copy of the edition of
1836, there is a footnote in Wordsworth's handwriting to the word
"meanwhile" which is substituted for "newly." "If 'newly' come, could he
have traced a visible path?"--Ed.]



This wish was not granted; the lamented Person, not long after, perished
by shipwreck, in discharge of his duty as Commander of the Honourable
East India Company's Vessel, the 'Earl of Abergavenny'.--W. W. 1815.

For the date of this poem in the Chronological Tables given in the
editions of 1815 and 1820, Wordsworth assigned the year 1802. But, in
the edition of 1836, he assigned it to the year 1805, the date retained
by Mr. Carter in the edition of 1857. Captain Wordsworth perished on the
5th of February 1805; and if the poem was written in 1805, it must have
been in the month of January of that year. The note to the poem is
explicit--"Not long after" he "perished by shipwreck," etc. Thus the
poem _may_ have been written in the beginning of 1805; but it is not at
all certain that part of it at least does not belong to an earlier year.
John Wordsworth lived with his brother and sister at the Town-end
Cottage, Grasmere, during part of the winter, and during the whole of
the spring, summer, and autumn of 1800, William and John going together
on foot into Yorkshire from the 14th of May to the 7th of June. John
left Grasmere on Michaelmas day (September 29th) 1800, and never
returned to it again. The following is Miss Wordsworth's record of that
day in her Journal of 1800:

  "On Monday, 29th, John left us. William and I parted with him in sight
  of Ullswater. It was a fine day, showery, but with sunshine and fine
  clouds. Poor fellow, my heart was right sad, I could not help thinking
  we should see him again, because he was only going to Penrith."

In the spring of 1801, John Wordsworth sailed for China in the
'Abergavenny'.  He returned from this voyage in safety, and the brothers
met once again in London. He went to sea again in 1803, and returned to
London in 1804, but could not visit Grasmere; and in the month of
February 1805--shortly after he was appointed to the command of the
'Abergavenny'--the ship was lost at the Bill of Portland, and every one
on board perished. It is clear that the latter part of the poem, "When,
to the attractions of the busy world," was written between John
Wordsworth's departure from Grasmere and the loss of the 'Abergavenny',
i. e. between September 1800 and February 1805, as there are references
in it both to what his brother did at Grasmere and to his return to
sea:

  'Back to the joyless Ocean thou art gone.'

There are some things in the earlier part of the poem that appear to
negative the idea of its having been written in 1800. The opening lines
seem to hint at an experience somewhat distant. He speaks of being
"wont" to do certain things. But, on the other hand, I find an entry in
Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal, which leads me to believe that the poem
may have been begun in 1800, and that the first part, ending (as it did
then) with the line:

  'While she is travelling through the dreary sea,'

may have been finished before John Wordsworth left Grasmere;
the second part being written afterwards, while he was at sea;
and that this is the explanation of the date given in the editions
of 1815 and 1820, viz. 1802.

Passages occur in Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal to the
following effect:

  "Monday Morning, 1st September.--We walked in the wood by the lake.
  William read 'Joanna' and 'the Firgrove' to Coleridge."

A little earlier there is the record,

  "Saturday, 22nd August.--William was composing all the morning....
  William read us the poem of 'Joanna' beside the Rothay by the
  roadside."

Then, on Friday, the 25th August, there is the entry,

  "We walked over the hill by the Firgrove, I sate upon a rock and
  observed a flight of swallows gathering together high above my head.
  We walked through the wood to the stepping stones, the lake of Rydale
  very beautiful, partly still, I left William to compose an
  inscription, that about the path...."

Then, next day,

  "Saturday morning, 30th August.--William finished his inscription of
  the Pathway, then walked in the wood, and when John returned he sought
  him, and they bathed together."

To what poem Dorothy Wordsworth referred under the name of the
"Inscription of the Pathway" has puzzled me much. There is no poem
amongst his "Inscriptions" (written in or before August 1800) that
corresponds to it in the least. But, if my conjecture is right that this
"Poem on the Naming of Places," beginning:

  'When, to the attractions of the busy world,'

was composed at two different times, it is quite possible that "the
Firgrove" which was read--along with 'Joanna'--to Coleridge on September
1st, 1800, was the first part of this very poem.

If this supposition is correct, some light is cast both on the
"Inscription of the Pathway." and on the date assigned by Wordsworth
himself to the poem. There is a certain fitness, however, in this poem
being placed--as it now is--in sequence to the 'Elegiac Verses' in
memory of John Wordsworth, beginning, "The Sheep-boy whistled loud," and
near the fourth poem 'To the Daisy', beginning, "Sweet Flower! belike
one day to have."

The "Fir-grove" still exists. It is between Wishing Gate and White Moss
Common, and almost exactly opposite the former. Standing at the gate and
looking eastwards, the grove is to the left, not forty yards distant.
Some of the firs (Scotch ones) still survive, and several beech trees,
not "a single beech-tree," as in the poem. From this, one might infer
that the present colony had sprung up since the beginning of the
century, and that the special tree, in which was the thrush's nest, had
perished; but Dr. Cradock wrote to me that "Wordsworth pointed out the
tree to Miss Cookson a few days before Dora Wordsworth's death. The tree
is near the upper wall and tells its own tale." The Fir-grove--"John's
Grove"--can easily be entered by a gate about a hundred yards beyond
the Wishing-gate, as one goes toward Rydal. The view from it, the
"visionary scene,"

                           'the spectacle
  Of clouded splendour, ... this dream-like sight
  Of solemn loveliness,'

is now much interfered with by the new larch plantations immediately
below the firs. It must have been very different in Wordsworth's time,
and is constantly referred to in his sister's Journal as a favourite
retreat, resorted to

                           'when cloudless suns
  Shone hot, or wind blew troublesome and strong.'

In the absence of contrary testimony, it might be supposed that "the
track" which the brother had "worn,"

  'By pacing here, unwearied and alone,'

faced Silver-How and the Grasmere Island, and that the single beech tree
was nearer the lower than the upper wall. But Miss Cookson's testimony
is explicit. Only a few fir trees survive at this part of the grove,
which is now open and desolate, not as it was in those earlier days,
when

                                  'the trees
  Had been so thickly planted, and had thriven
  With such perplexed and intricate array,
  That vainly did I seek, beneath their stems
  A length of open space ...'

Dr. Cradock remarks,

  "As to there being more than one beech, Wordsworth would not have
  hesitated to sacrifice servile exactness to poetical effect." He had a
  fancy for "one"--

    'Fair as a star when only one
    Is shining in the sky;'

  "'One' abode, no more;" Grasmere's "one green island;" "one green
  field."

Since the above note was printed, new light has been cast on the
"Inscription of the Pathway," for which see volume viii. of this
edition.--Ed.

THE COTTAGER TO HER INFANT

BY MY SISTER


Composed 1805.--Published 1815


[Suggested to her, while beside my sleeping children.--I. F.]

One of the "Poems founded on the Affections."--Ed.




  The days are cold, the nights are long,
  The north-wind sings a doleful song;
  Then hush again upon my breast;
  All merry things are now at rest,
    Save thee, my pretty Love!                          5

  The kitten sleeps upon the hearth,
  The crickets long have ceased their mirth;
  There's nothing stirring in the house
  Save one _wee_, hungry, nibbling mouse,
    Then why so busy thou?                             10

  Nay! start not at that sparkling light;
  'Tis but the moon that shines so bright
  On the window pane bedropped with rain:
  Then, little Darling! sleep again,
    And wake when it is day.                           15



This poem underwent no change in successive editions. The title in all
the earlier ones (1815 to 1843) was 'The Cottager to her Infant. By a
Female Friend'; and in the preface to the edition of 1815, Wordsworth
wrote,

  "Three short pieces (now first published) are the work of a Female
  Friend; ... if any one regard them with dislike, or be disposed to
  condemn them, let the censure fall upon him, who, trusting in his own
  sense of their merit, and their fitness for the place which they
  occupy, _extorted_ them from the Authoress."

In the edition of 1845, he disclosed the authorship; and gave the more
natural title, 'By my Sister'. Other two poems by her were introduced
into the edition of 1815, and subsequent ones, viz. the 'Address to a
Child', and 'The Mother's Return'. In an appendix to a MS. copy of the
'Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland', by Dorothy Wordsworth,
transcribed by Mrs. Clarkson, I find the poem 'The Cottager to her
Infant' with two additional stanzas, which are there attributed to
Wordsworth. The appendix runs thus:

  "To my Niece Dorothy, a sleepless Baby

    THE COTTAGER TO HER INFANT

  (The third and fourth stanzas which follow by W. W.)

    'Ah! if I were a lady gay
    I should not grieve with thee to play;
    Right gladly would I lie awake
    Thy lively spirits to partake,
      And ask no better cheer.

    But, Babe! there's none to work for me.
    And I must rise to industry;
    Soon as the cock begins to crow
    Thy mother to the fold must go
      To tend the sheep and kine.'"

TO CHARLES LAMB, ESQ.

MY DEAR FRIEND,

When I sent you, a few weeks ago, the Tale of 'Peter Bell', you asked
"why THE WAGGONER was not added?"--To say the truth,--from the higher
tone of imagination, and the deeper touches of passion aimed at in the
former, I apprehended, this little Piece could not accompany it without
disadvantage. In the year 1806, if I am not mistaken, THE WAGGONER was
read to you in manuscript; and, as you have remembered it for so long a
time, I am the more encouraged to hope, that, since the localities on
which it partly depends did not prevent its being interesting to you, it
may prove acceptable to others. Being therefore in some measure the
cause of its present appearance, you must allow me the gratification of
inscribing it to you; in acknowledgment of the pleasure I have derived
from your Writings, and of the high esteem with which
I am
Very truly yours,
WILLIAM WORDSWORTH.

RYDAL MOUNT, _May 20th_, 1819.




CANTO FIRST


  'Tis spent--this burning day of June!
  Soft darkness o'er its latest gleams is stealing;
  The buzzing dor-hawk, round and round, is wheeling,--
  That solitary bird
  Is all that can be heard [1]                                       5
  In silence deeper far than that of deepest noon!

    Confiding Glow-worms, 'tis a night
  Propitious to your earth-born light!
  But, where the scattered stars are seen
  In hazy straits the clouds between,                               10
  Each, in his station twinkling not,
  Seems changed into a pallid spot. [2]
  The mountains against heaven's grave weight
  Rise up, and grow to wondrous height. [3]
  The air, as in a lion's den,                                      15
  Is close and hot;--and now and then
  Comes a tired [4] and sultry breeze
  With a haunting and a panting,
  Like the stifling of disease;
  But the dews [5] allay the heat,                                  20
  And the silence makes it sweet.

    Hush, there is some one on the stir!
  'Tis Benjamin the Waggoner;
  Who long hath trod this toilsome way,
  Companion of the night and [6] day.                               25
  That far-off tinkling's drowsy cheer,
  Mix'd with a faint yet grating sound
  In a moment lost and found,
  The Wain announces--by whose side
  Along the banks of Rydal Mere                                     30
  He paces on, a trusty Guide,--
  Listen! you can scarcely hear!
  Hither he his course is bending;--
  Now he leaves the lower ground,
  And up the craggy hill ascending                                  35
  Many a stop and stay he makes,
  Many a breathing-fit he takes;--[7]
  Steep the way and wearisome,
  Yet all the while his whip is dumb!

    The Horses have worked with right good-will,                    40
  And so [8] have gained the top of the hill;
  He was patient, they were strong,
  And now they smoothly glide along,
  Recovering [9] breath, and pleased to win
  The praises of mild Benjamin.                                     45
  Heaven shield him from mishap and snare!
  But why so early with this prayer?
  Is it for threatenings in the sky?
  Or for some other danger nigh?
  No; none is near him yet, though he                               50
  Be one of much infirmity; [10]
  For at the bottom of the brow,
  Where once the DOVE and OLIVE-BOUGH
  Offered a greeting of good ale
  To all who entered Grasmere Vale;                                 55
  And called on him who must depart
  To leave it with a jovial heart;
  There, where the DOVE and OLIVE-BOUGH
  Once hung, a Poet harbours now,
  A simple water-drinking Bard;                                     60
  Why need our Hero then (though frail
  His best resolves) be on his guard?
  He marches by, secure and bold;
  Yet while he thinks on times of old,
  It seems that all looks wondrous cold;                            65
  He shrugs his shoulders, shakes his head,
  And, for the honest folk within,
  It is a doubt with Benjamin
  Whether they be alive or dead!

    _Here_ is no danger,--none at all!                              70
  Beyond his wish he walks secure; [11]
  But pass a mile--and _then_ for trial,--
  Then for the pride of self-denial;
  If he resist that tempting door,
  Which with such friendly voice will call;                         75
  If he resist those casement panes,
  And that bright gleam which thence will fall
  Upon his Leaders' bells and manes,
  Inviting him with cheerful lure:
  For still, though all be dark elsewhere,                          80
  Some shining notice will be 'there'
  Of open house and ready fare.

    The place to Benjamin right well [12]
  Is known, and by as strong a spell
  As used to be that sign of love                                   85
  And hope--the OLIVE-BOUGH and DOVE;
  He knows it to his cost, good Man!
  Who does not know the famous SWAN?
  Object uncouth! and yet our boast, [13]
  For it was painted by the Host;                                   90
  His own conceit the figure planned,
  'Twas coloured all by his own hand;
  And that frail Child of thirsty clay,
  Of whom I sing [14] this rustic lay,
  Could tell with self-dissatisfaction                              95
  Quaint stories of the bird's attraction! [C]

    Well! that is past--and in despite
  Of open door and shining light.
  And now the conqueror essays
  The long ascent of Dunmail-raise;                                100
  And with his team is gentle here
  As when he clomb from Rydal Mere;
  His whip they do not dread--his voice
  They only hear it to rejoice.
  To stand or go is at _their_ pleasure;                           105
  Their efforts and their time they measure
  By generous pride within the breast;
  And, while they strain, and while they rest,
  He thus pursues his thoughts at leisure.

    Now am I fairly safe to-night--110
  And with proud cause my heart is light: [15]
  I trespassed lately worse than ever--
  But Heaven has blest [16] a good endeavour;
  And, to my soul's content, [17] I find
  The evil One is left behind.                                     115
  Yes, let my master fume and fret,
  Here am I--with my horses yet!
  My jolly team, he finds that ye
  Will work for nobody but me!
  Full proof of this the Country gained;                           120
  It knows how ye were vexed and strained,
  And forced unworthy stripes to bear,
  When trusted to another's care. [18]
  Here was it--on this rugged slope,
  Which now ye climb with heart and hope,                          125
  I saw you, between rage and fear,
  Plunge, and fling back a spiteful ear,
  And ever more and more confused,
  As ye were more and more abused: [19]
  As chance would have it, passing by                              130
  I saw you in that [20] jeopardy:
  A word from me was like a charm; [D]
  Ye pulled together with one mind; [21]
  And your huge burthen, safe from harm,
  Moved like a vessel in the wind!                                 135
  --Yes, without me, up hills so high
  'Tis vain to strive for mastery.
  Then grieve not, jolly team! though tough
  The road we travel, steep, and rough; [22]
  Though Rydal-heights and Dunmail-raise,                          140
  And all their fellow banks and braes,
  Full often make you stretch and strain,
  And halt for breath and halt again,
  Yet to their sturdiness 'tis owing
  That side by side we still are going!                            145

    While Benjamin in earnest mood
  His meditations thus pursued,
  A storm, which had been smothered long,
  Was growing inwardly more strong;
  And, in its struggles to get free,                               150
  Was busily employed as he.
  The thunder had begun to growl--
  He heard not, too intent of soul;
  The air was now without a breath--
  He marked not that 'twas still as death.                         155
  But soon large rain-drops on his head [23]
  Fell with the weight of drops of lead;--
  He starts--and takes, at the admonition,
  A sage survey of his condition. [24]
  The road is black before his eyes,                               160
  Glimmering faintly where it lies;
  Black is the sky--and every hill,
  Up to the sky, is blacker still--
  Sky, hill, and dale, one dismal room, [25]
  Hung round and overhung with gloom;                              165
  Save that above a single height
  Is to be seen a lurid light,
  Above Helm-crag [E]--a streak half dead,
  A burning of portentous red;
  And near that lurid light, full well                             170
  The ASTROLOGER, sage Sidrophel,
  Where at his desk and book he sits,
  Puzzling aloft [26] his curious wits;
  He whose domain is held in common
  With no one but the ANCIENT WOMAN,                               175
  Cowering beside her rifted cell,
  As if intent on magic spell;-
  Dread pair, that, spite of wind and weather,
  Still sit upon Helm-crag together!

    The ASTROLOGER was not unseen                                  180
  By solitary Benjamin;
  But total darkness came anon,
  And he and every thing was gone:
  And suddenly a ruffling breeze,
  (That would have rocked the sounding trees                       185
  Had aught of sylvan growth been there)
  Swept through the Hollow long and bare: [27]
  The rain rushed down--the road was battered,
  As with the force of billows shattered;
  The horses are dismayed, nor know                                190
  Whether they should stand or go;
  And Benjamin is groping near them,
  Sees nothing, and can scarcely hear them.
  He is astounded,--wonder not,--
  With such a charge in such a spot;                               195
  Astounded in the mountain gap
  With thunder-peals, clap after clap,
  Close-treading on the silent flashes--
  And somewhere, as he thinks, by crashes [28]
  Among the rocks; with weight of rain,                            200
  And sullen [29] motions long and slow,
  That to a dreary distance go--
  Till, breaking in upon the dying strain,
  A rending o'er his head begins the fray again.

    Meanwhile, uncertain what to do,                               205
  And oftentimes compelled to halt,
  The horses cautiously pursue
  Their way, without mishap or fault;
  And now have reached that pile of stones,
  Heaped over brave King Dunmail's bones;                          210
  He who had once supreme command,
  Last king of rocky Cumberland;
  His bones, and those of all his Power,
  Slain here in a disastrous hour!

    When, passing through this narrow strait,                      215
  Stony, and dark, and desolate,
  Benjamin can faintly hear
  A voice that comes from some one near,
  A female voice:--"Whoe'er you be,
  Stop," it exclaimed, "and pity me!"                              220
  And, less in pity than in wonder,
  Amid the darkness and the thunder,
  The Waggoner, with prompt command,
  Summons his horses to a stand.

    While, with increasing agitation,                              225
  The Woman urged her supplication,
  In rueful words, with sobs between--
  The voice of tears that fell unseen; [30]
  There came a flash--a startling glare,
  And all Seat-Sandal was laid bare!                               230
  'Tis not a time for nice suggestion,
  And Benjamin, without a question,
  Taking her for some way-worn rover, [31]
  Said, "Mount, and get you under cover!"
  Another voice, in tone as hoarse                                 235
  As a swoln brook with rugged course,
  Cried out, "Good brother, why so fast?
  I've had a glimpse of you--'avast!'
  Or, since it suits you to be civil,
  Take her at once--for good and evil!"                            240

  "It is my Husband," softly said
  The Woman, as if half afraid:
  By this time she was snug within,
  Through help of honest Benjamin;
  She and her Babe, which to her breast                            245
  With thankfulness the Mother pressed;
  And now the same strong voice more near
  Said cordially, "My Friend, what cheer?
  Rough doings these! as God's my judge,
  The sky owes somebody a grudge!                                  250
  We've had in half an hour or less
  A twelvemonth's terror [32] and distress!"

  Then Benjamin entreats the Man
  Would mount, too, quickly as he can:
  The Sailor--Sailor now no more,                                  255
  But such he had been heretofore--
  To courteous Benjamin replied,
  "Go you your way, and mind not me;
  For I must have, whate'er betide,
  My Ass and fifty things beside,--260
  Go, and I'll follow speedily!"

  The Waggon moves--and with its load
  Descends along the sloping road;
  And the rough Sailor instantly
  Turns to a little tent hard by: [33]                             265
  For when, at closing-in of day,
  The family had come that way,
  Green pasture and the soft warm air
  Tempted [34] them to settle there.--
  Green is the grass for beast to graze,                           270
  Around the stones of Dunmail-raise!

  The Sailor gathers up his bed,
  Takes down the canvass overhead;
  And, after farewell to the place,
  A parting word--though not of grace,                             275
  Pursues, with Ass and all his store,
  The way the Waggon went before.



CANTO SECOND


  If Wytheburn's modest House of prayer,
  As lowly as the lowliest dwelling,
  Had, with its belfry's humble stock,                             280
  A little pair that hang in air,
  Been mistress also of a clock,
  (And one, too, not in crazy plight)
  Twelve strokes that clock would have been telling
  Under the brow of old Helvellyn--285
  Its bead-roll of midnight,
  Then, when the Hero of my tale
  Was passing by, and, down the vale
  (The vale now silent, hushed I ween
  As if a storm had never been)                                    290
  Proceeding with a mind at ease;
  While the old Familiar of the seas [35]
  Intent to use his utmost haste,
  Gained ground upon the Waggon fast,
  And gives another lusty cheer;                                   295
  For spite of rumbling of the wheels,
  A welcome greeting he can hear;--
  It is a fiddle in its glee
  Dinning from the CHERRY TREE!

  Thence the sound--the light is there--300
  As Benjamin is now aware,
  Who, to his inward thoughts confined,
  Had almost reached the festive door,
  When, startled by the Sailor's roar, [36]
  He hears a sound and sees the light,                             305
  And in a moment calls to mind
  That 'tis the village MERRY-NIGHT! [F]

  Although before in no dejection,
  At this insidious recollection
  His heart with sudden joy is filled,--310
  His ears are by the music thrilled,
  His eyes take pleasure in the road
  Glittering before him bright and broad;
  And Benjamin is wet and cold,
  And there are reasons manifold                                   315
  That make the good, tow'rds which he's yearning,
  Look fairly like a lawful earning.

    Nor has thought time to come and go,
  To vibrate between yes and no;
  For, cries the Sailor, "Glorious chance                          320
  That blew us hither!--let him dance,
  Who can or will!--my honest soul,
  Our treat shall be a friendly bowl!" [37]
  He draws him to the door--"Come in,
  Come, come," cries he to Benjamin!                               325
  And Benjamin--ah, woe is me!
  Gave the word--the horses heard
  And halted, though reluctantly.

    "Blithe souls and lightsome hearts have we,
  Feasting at the CHERRY TREE!"                                    330
  This was the outside proclamation,
  This was the inside salutation;
  What bustling--jostling--high and low!
  A universal overflow!
  What tankards foaming from the tap!                              335
  What store of cakes in every lap!
  What thumping--stumping--overhead!
  The thunder had not been more busy:
  With such a stir you would have said,
  This little place may well be dizzy!                             340
  'Tis who can dance with greatest vigour--
  'Tis what can be most prompt and eager;
  As if it heard the fiddle's call,
  The pewter clatters on the wall;
  The very bacon shows its feeling,                                345
  Swinging from the smoky ceiling!

    A steaming bowl, a blazing fire,
  What greater good can heart desire?
  'Twere worth a wise man's while to try
  The utmost anger of the sky:                                     350
  To _seek_ for thoughts of a gloomy cast,
  If such the bright amends at last. [38]
  Now should you say [39] I judge amiss,
  The CHERRY TREE shows proof of this;
  For soon of all [40] the happy there,                            355
  Our Travellers are the happiest pair;
  All care with Benjamin is gone--
  A Cæsar past the Rubicon!
  He thinks not of his long, long strife;--
  The Sailor, Man by nature gay,                                   360
  Hath no resolves to throw away; [41]
  And he hath now forgot his Wife,
  Hath quite forgotten her--or may be
  Thinks her the luckiest soul on earth,
  Within that warm and peaceful berth, [42]                        365
             Under cover,
             Terror over,
  Sleeping by her sleeping Baby.

    With bowl that sped from hand to hand,
  The gladdest of the gladsome band,                               370
  Amid their own delight and fun, [43]
  They hear--when every dance is done,
  When every whirling bout is o'er--[44]
  The fiddle's _squeak_ [G]--that call to bliss,
  Ever followed by a kiss;                                         375
  They envy not the happy lot,
  But enjoy their own the more!

    While thus our jocund Travellers fare,
  Up springs the Sailor from his chair--
  Limps (for I might have told before                              380
  That he was lame) across the floor--
  Is gone--returns--and with a prize;
  With what?--a Ship of lusty size;
  A gallant stately Man-of-war,
  Fixed on a smoothly-sliding car.                                 385
  Surprise to all, but most surprise
  To Benjamin, who rubs his eyes,
  Not knowing that he had befriended
  A Man so gloriously attended!

    "This," cries the Sailor, "a Third-rate is--390
  Stand back, and you shall see her gratis!
  This was the Flag-ship at the Nile,
  The Vanguard--you may smirk and smile,
  But, pretty Maid, if you look near,
  You'll find you've much in little here!                          395
  A nobler ship did never swim,
  And you shall see her in full trim:
  I'll set, my friends, to do you honour,
  Set every inch of sail upon her."
  So said, so done; and masts, sails, yards,                       400
  He names them all; and interlards
  His speech with uncouth terms of art,
  Accomplished in the showman's part;
  And then, as from a sudden check,
  Cries out--"'Tis there, the quarter-deck                         405
  On which brave Admiral Nelson stood--
  A sight that would have roused your blood!
  One eye he had, which, bright as ten,
  Burned like a fire among his men;
  Let this be land, and that be sea,                               410
  Here lay the French--and _thus_ came we!" [H]

    Hushed was by this the fiddle's sound,
  The dancers all were gathered round,
  And, such the stillness of the house,
  You might have heard a nibbling mouse;                           415
  While, borrowing helps where'er he may,
  The Sailor through the story runs
  Of ships to ships and guns to guns;
  And does his utmost to display
  The dismal conflict, and the might                               420
  And terror of that marvellous [45] night!
  "A bowl, a bowl of double measure,"
  Cries Benjamin, "a draught of length,
  To Nelson, England's pride and treasure,
  Her bulwark and her tower of strength!"                          425
  When Benjamin had seized the bowl,
  The mastiff, from beneath the waggon,
  Where he lay, watchful as a dragon,
  Rattled his chain;--'twas all in vain,
  For Benjamin, triumphant soul!                                   430
  He heard the monitory growl;
  Heard--and in opposition quaffed
  A deep, determined, desperate draught!
  Nor did the battered Tar forget,
  Or flinch from what he deemed his debt:                          435
  Then, like a hero crowned with laurel,
  Back to her place the ship he led;
  Wheeled her back in full apparel;
  And so, flag flying at mast head,
  Re-yoked her to the Ass:--anon,                                  440
  Cries Benjamin, "We must be gone."
  Thus, after two hours' hearty stay,
  Again behold them on their way!


CANTO THIRD

  Right gladly had the horses stirred,
  When they the wished-for greeting heard,                         445
  The whip's loud notice from the door,
  That they were free to move once more.
  You think, those [46] doings must have bred
  In them disheartening doubts and dread;
  No, not a horse of all the eight,                                450
  Although it be a moonless night,
  Fears either for himself or freight;
  For this they know (and let it hide,
  In part, the offences of their guide)
  That Benjamin, with clouded brains,                              455
  Is worth the best with all their pains;
  And, if they had a prayer to make,
  The prayer would be that they may take
  With him whatever comes in course,
  The better fortune or the worse;                                 460
  That no one else may have business near them,
  And, drunk or sober, he may steer them.

    So, forth in dauntless mood they fare,
  And with them goes the guardian pair.

    Now, heroes, for the true commotion,                           465
  The triumph of your late devotion!
  Can aught on earth impede delight,
  Still mounting to a higher height;
  And higher still--a greedy flight!
  Can any low-born care pursue her,                                470
  Can any mortal clog come to her? [J]
  No notion have they--not a thought,
  That is from joyless regions brought!
  And, while they coast the silent lake,
  Their inspiration I partake;                                     475
  Share their empyreal spirits--yea,
  With their enraptured vision, see--
  O fancy--what a jubilee!
  What shifting pictures--clad in gleams
  Of colour bright as feverish dreams!                             480
  Earth, spangled sky, and lake serene,
  Involved and restless all--a scene
  Pregnant with mutual exaltation,
  Rich change, and multiplied creation!
  This sight to me the Muse imparts;--485
  And then, what kindness in their hearts!
  What tears of rapture, what vow-making,
  Profound entreaties, and hand-shaking!
  What solemn, vacant, interlacing,
  As if they'd fall asleep embracing!                              490
  Then, in the turbulence of glee,
  And in the excess of amity,
  Says Benjamin, "That Ass of thine,
  He spoils thy sport, and hinders mine:
  If he were tethered to the waggon,                               495
  He'd drag as well what he is dragging;
  And we, as brother should with brother,
  Might trudge it alongside each other!"

    Forthwith, obedient to command,
  The horses made a quiet stand;                                   500
  And to the waggon's skirts was tied
  The Creature, by the Mastiff's side,
  The Mastiff wondering, and perplext
  With dread of what will happen next;
  And thinking it but sorry cheer,                                 505
  To have such company so near! [47]

    This new arrangement made, the Wain
  Through the still night proceeds again;
  No Moon hath risen her light to lend;
  But indistinctly may be kenned                                   510
  The VANGUARD, following close behind,
  Sails spread, as if to catch the wind!

    "Thy wife and child are snug and warm,
  Thy ship will travel without harm;
  I like," said Benjamin, "her shape and stature:                  515
  And this of mine--this bulky creature
  Of which I have the steering--this,
  Seen fairly, is not much amiss!
  We want your streamers, friend, you know;
  But, altogether [48] as we go,                                   520
  We make a kind of handsome show!
  Among these hills, from first to last,
  We've weathered many a furious blast;
  Hard passage forcing on, with head
  Against the storm, and canvass spread.                           525
  I hate a boaster; but to thee
  Will say't, who know'st both land and sea,
  The unluckiest hulk that stems [49] the brine
  Is hardly worse beset than mine,
  When cross-winds on her quarter beat;                            530
  And, fairly lifted from my feet,
  I stagger onward--heaven knows how;
  But not so pleasantly as now:
  Poor pilot I, by snows confounded,
  And many a foundrous pit surrounded!                             535
  Yet here we are, by night and day
  Grinding through rough and smooth our way;
  Through foul and fair our task fulfilling;
  And long shall be so yet--God willing!"

    "Ay," said the Tar, "through fair and foul--540
  But save us from yon screeching owl!"
  That instant was begun a fray
  Which called their thoughts another way:
  The mastiff, ill-conditioned carl!
  What must he do but growl and snarl,                             545
  Still more and more dissatisfied
  With the meek comrade at his side!
  Till, not incensed though put to proof,
  The Ass, uplifting a hind hoof,
  Salutes the Mastiff on the head;                                 550
  And so were better manners bred,
  And all was calmed and quieted.

    "Yon screech-owl," says the Sailor, turning
  Back to his former cause of mourning,
  "Yon owl!--pray God that all be well!                            555
  'Tis worse than any funeral bell;
  As sure as I've the gift of sight,
  We shall be meeting ghosts to-night!"
--Said Benjamin, "This whip shall lay
  A thousand, if they cross our way.                               560
  I know that Wanton's noisy station,
  I know him and his occupation;
  The jolly bird hath learned his cheer
  Upon [50] the banks of Windermere;
  Where a tribe of them make merry,                                565
  Mocking the Man that keeps the ferry;
  Hallooing from an open throat,
  Like travellers shouting for a boat.
--The tricks he learned at Windermere
  This vagrant owl is playing here--570
  That is the worst of his employment:
  He's at the top [51] of his enjoyment!"

    This explanation stilled the alarm,
  Cured the foreboder like a charm;
  This, and the manner, and the voice,                             575
  Summoned the Sailor to rejoice;
  His heart is up--he fears no evil
  From life or death, from man or devil;
  He wheels [52]--and, making many stops,
  Brandished his crutch against the mountain tops;                 580
  And, while he talked of blows and scars,
  Benjamin, among the stars,
  Beheld a dancing--and a glancing;
  Such retreating and advancing
  As, I ween, was never seen                                       585
  In bloodiest battle since the days of Mars!



CANTO FOURTH


  Thus they, with freaks of proud delight,
  Beguile the remnant of the night;
  And many a snatch of jovial song
  Regales them as they wind along;                                 590
  While to the music, from on high,
  The echoes make a glad reply.--
  But the sage Muse the revel heeds
  No farther than her story needs;
  Nor will she servilely attend                                    595
  The loitering journey to its end.
--Blithe spirits of her own impel
  The Muse, who scents the morning air,
  To take of this transported pair
  A brief and unreproved farewell;                                 600
  To quit the slow-paced waggon's side,
  And wander down yon hawthorn dell,
  With murmuring Greta for her guide.
--There doth she ken the awful form
  Of Raven-crag--black as a storm--605
  Glimmering through the twilight pale;
  And Ghimmer-crag, [K] his tall twin brother,
  Each peering forth to meet the other:--
  And, while she roves [53] through St. John's Vale,
  Along the smooth unpathwayed plain,                              610
  By sheep-track or through cottage lane,
  Where no disturbance comes to intrude
  Upon the pensive solitude,
  Her unsuspecting eye, perchance,
  With the rude shepherd's favoured glance,                        615
  Beholds the faeries in array,
  Whose party-coloured garments gay
  The silent company betray:
  Red, green, and blue; a moment's sight!
  For Skiddaw-top with rosy light                                  620
  Is touched--and all the band take flight.
--Fly also, Muse! and from the dell
  Mount to the ridge of Nathdale Fell;
  Thence, look thou forth o'er wood and lawn
  Hoar with the frost-like dews of dawn;                           625
  Across yon meadowy bottom look,
  Where close fogs hide their parent brook;
  And see, beyond that hamlet small,
  The ruined towers of Threlkeld-hall,
  Lurking in a double shade,                                       630
  By trees and lingering twilight made!
  There, at Blencathara's rugged feet,
  Sir Lancelot gave a safe retreat
  To noble Clifford; from annoy
  Concealed the persecuted boy,                                    635
  Well pleased in rustic garb to feed
  His flock, and pipe on shepherd's reed
  Among this multitude of hills,
  Crags, woodlands, waterfalls, and rills;
  Which soon the morning shall enfold,                             640
  From east to west, in ample vest
  Of massy gloom and radiance bold.

    The mists, that o'er the streamlet's bed
  Hung low, begin to rise and spread;
  Even while I speak, their skirts of grey                         645
  Are smitten by a silver ray;
  And lo!--up Castrigg's naked steep
  (Where, smoothly urged, the vapours sweep
  Along--and scatter and divide,
  Like fleecy clouds self-multiplied)                              650
  The stately waggon is ascending,
  With faithful Benjamin attending,
  Apparent now beside his team--
  Now lost amid a glittering steam: [54]
  And with him goes his Sailor-friend,                             655
  By this time near their journey's end;
  And, after their high-minded riot,
  Sickening into thoughtful quiet;
  As if the morning's pleasant hour,
  Had for their joys a killing power.                              660
  And, sooth, for Benjamin a vein
  Is opened of still deeper pain,
  As if his heart by notes were stung
  From out the lowly hedge-rows flung;
  As if the warbler lost in light [L]                              665
  Reproved his soarings of the night,
  In strains of rapture pure and holy
  Upbraided his distempered folly. [55]

    Drooping is he, his step is dull; [56]
  But the horses stretch and pull;                                 670
  With increasing vigour climb,
  Eager to repair lost time;
  Whether, by their own desert,
  Knowing what cause there is [57] for shame,
  They are labouring to avert                                      675
  As much as may be of the blame, [58]
  Which, they foresee, must soon alight
  Upon _his_ head, whom, in despite
  Of all his failings, they love best; [59]
  Whether for him they are distrest,                               680
  Or, by length of fasting roused,
  Are impatient to be housed:
  Up against the hill they strain
  Tugging at the iron chain,
  Tugging all with might and main,                                 685
  Last and foremost, every horse
  To the utmost of his force!
  And the smoke and respiration,
  Rising like an exhalation,
  Blend [60] with the mist--a moving shroud                        690
  To form, an undissolving cloud;
  Which, with slant ray, the merry sun
  Takes delight to play upon.
  Never golden-haired Apollo,
  Pleased some favourite chief to follow                           695
  Through accidents of peace or war,
  In a perilous moment threw
  Around the object of his care
  Veil of such celestial hue; [61]
  Interposed so bright a screen--700
  Him and his enemies between!

    Alas! what boots it?--who can hide,
  When the malicious Fates are bent
  On working out an ill intent?
  Can destiny be turned aside?                                     705
  No--sad progress of my story!
  Benjamin, this outward glory
  Cannot shield [62] thee from thy Master,
  Who from Keswick has pricked forth,
  Sour and surly as the north;                                     710
  And, in fear of some disaster,
  Comes to give what help he may,
  And [63] to hear what thou canst say;
  If, as needs he must forebode, [64]
  Thou hast been loitering [65] on the road!                       715
  His fears, his doubts, [66] may now take flight--
  The wished-for object is in sight;
  Yet, trust the Muse, it rather hath
  Stirred him up to livelier wrath;
  Which he stifles, moody man!                                     720
  With all the patience that he can;
  To the end that, at your meeting,
  He may give thee decent greeting.

    There he is--resolved to stop,
  Till the waggon gains the top;                                   725
  But stop he cannot--must advance:
  Him Benjamin, with lucky glance,
  Espies--and instantly is ready,
  Self-collected, poised, and steady:
  And, to be the better seen,                                      730
  Issues from his radiant shroud,
  From his close-attending cloud,
  With careless air and open mien.
  Erect his port, and firm his going;
  So struts yon cock that now is crowing;                          735
  And the morning light in grace
  Strikes upon his lifted face,
  Hurrying the pallid hue away
  That might his trespasses betray.
  But what can all avail to clear him,                             740
  Or what need of explanation,
  Parley or interrogation?
  For the Master sees, alas!
  That unhappy Figure near him,
  Limping o'er the dewy grass,                                     745
  Where the road it fringes, sweet,
  Soft and cool to way-worn feet;
  And, O indignity! an Ass,
  By his noble Mastiffs side,
  Tethered to the waggon's tail:                                   750
  And the ship, in all her pride,
  Following after in full sail!
  Not to speak of babe and mother;
  Who, contented with each other,
  And snug as birds in leafy arbour,                               755
  Find, within, a blessed harbour!

    With eager eyes the Master pries;
  Looks in and out, and through and through;
  Says nothing--till at last he spies
  A wound upon the Mastiff's head,                                 760
  A wound, where plainly might be read
  What feats an Ass's hoof can do!
  But drop the rest:--this aggravation,
  This complicated provocation,
  A hoard of grievances unsealed;                                  765
  All past forgiveness it repealed;
  And thus, and through distempered blood
  On both sides, Benjamin the good,
  The patient, and the tender-hearted,
  Was from his team and waggon parted;                             770
  When duty of that day was o'er,
  Laid down his whip--and served no more.--
  Nor could the waggon long survive,
  Which Benjamin had ceased to drive:
  It lingered on;--guide after guide                               775
  Ambitiously the office tried;
  But each unmanageable hill
  Called for _his_ patience and _his_ skill;--
  And sure it is, that through this night,
  And what the morning brought to light,                           780
  Two losses had we to sustain,
  We lost both WAGGONER and WAIN!

         *       *       *       *       *

  Accept, O Friend, for praise or blame,
  The gift of this adventurous song;
  A record which I dared to frame,                                 785
  Though timid scruples checked me long;
  They checked me--and I left the theme
  Untouched;--in spite of many a gleam
  Of fancy which thereon was shed,
  Like pleasant sunbeams shifting still                            790
  Upon the side of a distant hill:
  But Nature might not be gainsaid;
  For what I have and what I miss
  I sing of these;--it makes my bliss!
  Nor is it I who play the part,                                   795
  But a shy spirit in my heart,
  That comes and goes--will sometimes leap
  From hiding-places ten years deep;
  Or haunts me with familiar face, [67]
  Returning, like a ghost unlaid,                                  800
  Until the debt I owe be paid.
  Forgive me, then; for I had been
  On friendly terms with this Machine: [M]
  In him, while he was wont to trace
  Our roads, through many a long year's space,                     805
  A living almanack had we;
  We had a speaking diary,
  That in this uneventful place,
  Gave to the days a mark and name
  By which we knew them when they came.                            810
--Yes, I, and all about me here,
  Through all the changes of the year,
  Had seen him through the mountains go,
  In pomp of mist or pomp of snow,
  Majestically huge and slow:                                      815
  Or, with a milder grace [68] adorning
  The landscape of a summer's morning;
  While Grasmere smoothed her liquid plain
  The moving image to detain;
  And mighty Fairfield, with a chime                               820
  Of echoes, to his march kept time;
  When little other business stirred,
  And little other sound was heard;
  In that delicious hour of balm,
  Stillness, solitude, and calm,                                   825
  While yet the valley is arrayed,
  On this side with a sober shade;
  On that is prodigally bright--
  Crag, lawn, and wood--with rosy light.
--But most of all, thou lordly Wain!                             830
  I wish to have thee here again,
  When windows flap and chimney roars,
  And all is dismal out of doors;
  And, sitting by my fire, I see
  Eight sorry carts, no less a train!                              835
  Unworthy successors of thee,
  Come straggling through the wind and rain:
  And oft, as they pass slowly on,
  Beneath my windows, [69] one by one,
  See, perched upon the naked height                               840
  The summit of a cumbrous freight,
  A single traveller--and there
  Another; then perhaps a pair--
  The lame, the sickly, and the old;
  Men, women, heartless with the cold;                             845
  And babes in wet and starveling plight;
  Which once, [70] be weather as it might,
  Had still a nest within a nest,
  Thy shelter--and their mother's breast!
  Then most of all, then far the most,                             850
  Do I regret what we have lost;
  Am grieved for that unhappy sin
  Which robbed us of good Benjamin;--
  And of his stately Charge, which none
  Could keep alive when He was gone!                               855

VARIANTS ON THE TEXT

[Variant 1:

1819.

  The Night-hawk is singing his frog-like tune,
  Twirling his watchman's rattle about--1805. MS. [a]

  The dor-hawk, solitary bird,
  Round the dim crags on heavy pinions wheeling,
  Buzzes incessantly, a tiresome tune;
  That constant voice is all that can be heard     1820.

  ... on heavy pinions wheeling,

  Sooth they come in company,
  And shine in quietness secure,
  On the mossy bank by the cottage door,
  As safe as on the loneliest moor.
  In the play, or on the hill,
  Everything is hushed and still;
  The clouds show here and there a spot
  Of a star that twinkles not,
  The air as in ...

From a MS. copy of the poem in Henry Crabb Robinson's 'Diary, etc'.
1812.

    Now that the children's busiest schemes
  Do all lie buried in blank sleep,
  Or only live in stirring dreams,
  The glow-worms fearless watch may keep;
  Rich prize as their bright lamps would be,
  They shine, a quiet company,
  On mossy bank by cottage-door,
  As safe as on the loneliest moor.
  In hazy straits the clouds between,
  And in their stations twinkling not,
  Some thinly-sprinkled stars are seen,
  Each changed into a pallid spot.              1836.

NOTES ON THE TEXT

(Added in the edition of 1836)


I

Several years after the event that forms the subject of the foregoing
poem, in company with my friend, the late Mr. Coleridge, I happened to
fall in with the person to whom the name of Benjamin is given. Upon our
expressing regret that we had not, for a long time, seen upon the road
either him or his waggon, he said:--"They could not do without me; and
as to the man who was put in my place, no good could come out of him; he
was a man of no _ideas_."

The fact of my discarded hero's getting the horses out of a great
difficulty with a word, as related in the poem, was told me by an
eye-witness.


II

  'The Dor-hawk, solitary bird.'

When the Poem was first written the note of the bird was thus described:

  'The Night-hawk is singing his frog-like tune,
  Twirling his watchman's rattle about--'

but from unwillingness to startle the reader at the outset by so bold a
mode of expression, the passage was altered as it now stands.


III

After the line, 'Can any mortal clog come to her', followed in the MS.
an incident which has been kept back. Part of the suppressed verses
shall here be given as a gratification of private feeling, which the
well-disposed reader will find no difficulty in excusing. They are now
printed for the first time.

  Can any mortal clog come to her?
  It can: ...
  ...
  But Benjamin, in his vexation,
  Possesses inward consolation;
  He knows his ground, and hopes to find
  A spot with all things to his mind,
  An upright mural block of stone,
  Moist with pure water trickling down.
  A slender spring; but kind to man
  It is, a true Samaritan;
  Close to the highway, pouring out
  Its offering from a chink or spout;
  Whence all, howe'er athirst, or drooping
  With toil, may drink, and without stooping.

    Cries Benjamin, "Where is it, where?
  Voice it hath none, but must be near."
--A star, declining towards the west,
  Upon the watery surface threw
  Its image tremulously imprest,
  That just marked out the object and withdrew:
  Right welcome service! ...
  ...

                         ROCK OF NAMES!
  Light is the strain, but not unjust
  To Thee and thy memorial-trust,
  That once seemed only to express
  Love that was love in idleness;
  Tokens, as year hath followed year,
  How changed, alas, in character!
  For they were graven on thy smooth breast
  By hands of those my soul loved best;
  Meek women, men as true and brave
  As ever went to a hopeful grave:
  Their hands and mine, when side by side
  With kindred zeal and mutual pride,
  We worked until the Initials took
  Shapes that defied a scornful look.--
  Long as for us a genial feeling
  Survives, or one in need of healing,
  The power, dear Rock, around thee cast,
  Thy monumental power, shall last
  For me and mine! O thought of pain,
  That would impair it or profane!
  Take all in kindness then, as said
  With a staid heart but playful head;
  And fail not Thou, loved Rock! to keep
  Thy charge when we are laid asleep.

W. W.



There is no poem more closely identified with the Grasmere district of
the English Lakes--and with the road from Grasmere to Keswick--than 'The
Waggoner' is, and in none are the topographical allusions more minute
and faithful.

Wordsworth seemed at a loss to know in what "class" of his poems to
place 'The Waggoner;' and his frequent changes--removing it from one
group to another--shew the artificial character of these classes. Thus,
in the edition of 1820, it stood first among the "Poems of the Fancy."
In 1827 it was the last of the "Poems founded on the Affections." In
1832 it was reinstated among the "Poems of the Fancy." In 1836 it had a
place of its own, and was inserted between the "Poems of the Fancy" and
those "Founded on the Affections;" while in 1845 it was sent back to its
original place among the "Poems of the Fancy;" although in the table of
contents it was printed as an independent poem, closing the series.

The original text of 'The Waggoner' underwent little change, till the
year 1836, when it was carefully revised, and altered throughout. The
final edition of 1845, however, reverted, in many instances--especially
in the first canto--to the original text of 1819.

As this poem was dedicated to Charles Lamb, it may be of interest to
note that, some six months afterwards, Lamb presented Wordsworth with a
copy of the first edition of 'Paradise Regained' (the edition of 1671),
writing on it the following sentence,

  "Charles Lamb, to the best knower of Milton, and therefore the
  worthiest occupant of this pleasant edition.--Jan. 2nd, 1820."

The opening stanzas are unrivalled in their description of a sultry June
evening, with a thunder-storm imminent.

  ' 'Tis spent--this burning day of June!
  Soft darkness o'er its latest gleams is stealing;
  The buzzing dor-hawk, round and round, is wheeling,--
  That solitary bird
  Is all that can be heard
  In silence deeper far than that of deepest noon!
  ...
  ...
  The mountains against heaven's grave weight
  Rise up, and grow to wondrous height.
  The air, as in a lion's den,
  Is close and hot;--and now and then
  Comes a tired and sultry breeze
  With a haunting and a panting,
  Like the stifling of disease;
  But the dews allay the heat,
  And the silence makes it sweet.'


The Waggoner takes what is now the middle road, of the three leading
from Rydal to Grasmere (see the note to 'The Primrose of the Rock'). The
"craggy hill" referred to in the lines

  'Now he leaves the lower ground,
  And up the craggy hill ascending
  ...
  Steep the way and wearisome,'

is the road from Rydal Quarry up to White Moss Common, with the Glowworm
rock on the right, and the "two heath-clad rocks," referred to in the
last of the "Poems on the Naming of Places," on the left. He next passes
"The Wishing Gate" on the left, John's Grove on the right, and descends
by Dove Cottage--where Wordsworth lived--to Grasmere.

  '... at the bottom of the brow,
  Where once the DOVE and OLIVE-BOUGH
  Offered a greeting of good ale
  To all who entered Grasmere Vale;
  And called on him who must depart
  To leave it with a jovial heart;
  There, where the DOVE and OLIVE-BOUGH
  Once hung, a Poet harbours now,
  A simple water-drinking Bard.'

He goes through Grasmere, passes the Swan Inn,

  'He knows it to his cost, good Man!
  Who does not know the famous SWAN?
  Object uncouth! and yet our boast,
  For it was painted by the Host;
  His own conceit the figure planned,
  'Twas coloured all by his own hand.'

As early as 1819, when the poem was first published, "this rude piece of
self-taught art had been supplanted" by a more pretentious figure. The
Waggoner passes the Swan,

  'And now the conqueror essays
  The long ascent of Dunmail-raise.'

As he proceeds, the storm gathers, and "struggles to get free." Road,
hill, and sky are dark; and he barely sees the well-known rocks at the
summit of Helm-crag, where two figures seem to sit, like those on the
Cobbler, near Arrochar, in Argyle.

  'Black is the sky--and every hill,
  Up to the sky, is blacker still--
  Sky, hill, and dale, one dismal room,
  Hung round and overhung with gloom;
  Save that above a single height
  Is to be seen a lurid light,
  Above Helm-crag--a streak half dead,
  A burning of portentous red;
  And near that lurid light, full well
  The ASTROLOGER, sage Sidrophel,
  Where at his desk and book he sits,
  Puzzling aloft his curious wits;
  He whose domain is held in common
  With no one but the ANCIENT WOMAN,
  Cowering beside her rifted cell,
  As if intent on magic spell;--
  Dread pair, that, spite of wind and weather,
  Still sit upon Helm-crag together!'

At the top of the "raise"--the water-shed between the vales of Grasmere
and Wytheburn--he reaches the familiar pile of stones, at the boundary
between the shires of Westmoreland and Cumberland.

  '... that pile of stones,
  Heaped over brave King Dunmail's bones;
  ...
  Green is the grass for beast to graze,
  Around the stones of Dunmail-raise!'

The allusion to Seat-Sandal laid bare by the flash of lightning, and the
description, in the last canto, of the ascent of the Raise by the
Waggoner on a summer morning, are as true to the spirit of the place as
anything that Wordsworth has written. He tells his friend Lamb, fourteen
years after he wrote the poem of 'The Waggoner,'

  'Yes, I, and all about me here,
  Through all the changes of the year,
  Had seen him through the mountains go,
  In pomp of mist or pomp of snow,
  Majestically huge and slow:
  Or, with a milder grace adorning
  The landscape of a summer's morning;
  While Grasmere smoothed her liquid plain
  The moving image to detain;
  And mighty Fairfield, with a chime
  Of echoes, to his march kept time;
  When little other business stirred,
  And little other sound was heard;
  In that delicious hour of balm,
  Stillness, solitude, and calm,
  While yet the valley is arrayed,
  On this side with a sober shade;
  On that is prodigally bright--
  Crag, lawn, and wood--with rosy light.'

From Dunmail-raise the Waggoner descends to Wytheburn. Externally,

  '... Wytheburn's modest House of prayer,
  As lowly as the lowliest dwelling,'

remains very much as it was in 1805; but the primitive simplicity and
"lowliness" of the chapel was changed by the addition a few years ago of
an apse, by the removal of some of the old rafters, and by the reseating
of the pews.

The Cherry Tree Tavern, where "the village Merry-night" was being
celebrated, still stands on the eastern or Helvellyn side of the road.
It is now a farm-house; but it will be regarded with interest from the
description of the rustic dance, which recalls ('longo intervallo') 'The
Jolly Beggars' of Burns. After two hours' delay at the Cherry Tree, the
Waggoner and Sailor "coast the silent lake" of Thirlmere, and pass the
Rock of Names.

This rock was, until lately, one of the most interesting memorials of
Wordsworth and his friends that survived in the Lake District; but the
vale of Thirlmere is now a Manchester water-tank, and the place which
knew the Rock of Names now knows it no more. It was a sort of trysting
place of the poets of Grasmere and Keswick--being nearly half-way
between the two places--and there, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and other
members of their households often met. When Coleridge left Grasmere for
Keswick, the Wordsworths usually accompanied him as far as this rock;
and they often met him there on his way over from Keswick to Grasmere.
Compare the Hon. Mr. Justice Coleridge's Reminiscences. ('Memoirs of
Wordsworth,' vol. ii. p. 310.)

The rock was on the right hand of the road, a little way past Waterhead,
at the southern end of Thirlmere; and on it were cut the letters,

  W. W.
  M. H.
  D. W.
  S. T. C.
  J. W.
  S. H.

the initials of William Wordsworth, Mary Hutchinson, Dorothy Wordsworth,
Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Wordsworth, and Sarah Hutchinson. The
Wordsworths settled at Grasmere at the close of the year 1799. As
mentioned in a previous note, John Wordsworth lived with his brother and
sister during most of that winter, and during the whole of the spring,
summer, and autumn of 1800, leaving it finally on September 29, 1800.
These names must therefore have been cut during the spring or summer of
1800. There is no record of the occurrence, and no allusion to the rock,
in Dorothy Wordsworth's Grasmere Journal of 1800. But that Journal, so
far as I have seen it, begins on the 14th of May 1800. Almost every
detail of the daily life and ways of the household at Dove Cottage is so
minutely recorded in it, that I am convinced that this incident of the
cutting of names in the Thirlmere Rock would have been mentioned, had it
happened between the 14th of May and John Wordsworth's departure from
Grasmere in September. Such references as this, for example, occur in
the Journal:

  "Saturday, August 2.--William and Coleridge went to Keswick. John went
  with them to Wytheburn, and staid all day fishing."

I therefore infer that it was in the spring or early summer of 1800 that
the names were cut.

I may add that the late Dean of Westminster--Dean Stanley--took much
interest in this Rock of Names; and doubt having been cast on the
accuracy of the place and the genuineness of the inscriptions, in a
letter from Dr. Fraser, then Bishop of Manchester, which he forwarded to
me, he entered into the question with all the interest with which he was
wont to track out details in the architecture or the history of a
Church.

There were few memorials connected with Wordsworth more worthy of
preservation than this "upright mural block of stone." When one
remembered that the initials on the rock were graven by the hands of
William and John Wordsworth, by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, possibly with
the assistance of Dorothy Wordsworth, the two Hutchinsons (Mary and
Sarah), and that Wordsworth says of it,

  'We worked until the Initials took
  Shapes that defied a scornful look,'

this Thirlmere Rock was felt to be a far more interesting memento of the
group of poets that used to meet beside it, than the Stone in the
grounds of Rydal Mount, which was spared at Wordsworth's suit, "from
some rude beauty of its own." There was simplicity, as well as strength,
in the way in which the initials were cut. But the stone was afterwards
desecrated by tourists, and others, who had the audacity to scratch
their own names or initials upon it. In 1877 I wrote, "The rock is as
yet wonderfully free from such; and its preservation is probably due to
the dark olive-coloured moss, with which the 'pure water trickling down'
has covered the face of the 'mural block,' and thus secured it from
observation, even on that highway;" but I found in the summer of 1882
that several other names had been ruthlessly added. When the Manchester
Thirlmere scheme was finally resolved upon, an effort was made to remove
the Stone, with the view of its being placed higher up the hill on the
side of the new roadway. In the course of this attempt, the Stone was
broken to pieces.

There is a very good drawing of "The Rock of Names" by Mr. Harry
Goodwin, in 'Through the Wordsworth Country, 1892'.

"The Muse" takes farewell of the Waggoner as he is proceeding with the
Sailor and his quaint model of the 'Vanguard' along the road toward
Keswick. She "scents the morning air," and

  'Quits the slow-paced waggon's side,
  To wander down yon hawthorn dell,
  With murmuring Greta for her guide.'

The "hawthorn dell" is the upper part of the Vale of St. John.

  '--There doth she ken the awful form
  Of Raven-crag--black as a storm--
  Glimmering through the twilight pale;
  And Ghimmer-crag, his tall twin brother,
  Each peering forth to meet the other.'

Raven-crag is well known,--H.C. Robinson writes of it in his 'Diary' in
1818, as "the most significant of the crags at a spot where there is not
one insignificant,"--a rock on the western side of Thirlmere, where the
Greta issues from the lake. But there is no rock in the district now
called by the name of Ghimmer-crag, or the crag of the Ewe-lamb. I am
inclined to think that Wordsworth referred to the "Fisher-crag" of the
Ordnance Survey and the Guide Books. No other rock round Thirlmere can
with any accuracy be called the "tall twin brother" of Raven-crag:
certainly not Great How, nor any spur of High Seat or Bleaberry Fell.
Fisher-crag resembles Raven-crag, as seen from Thirlmere Bridge, or from
the high road above it; and it is somewhat remarkable that Green--in his
Guide to the Lakes (a volume which the poet possessed)--makes use of the
same expression as that which Wordsworth adopts regarding these two
crags, Raven and Fisher.

  "The margin of the lake on the Dalehead side has its charms of wood
  and water; and Fischer Crag, twin brother to Raven Crag, is no bad
  object, when taken near the island called Buck's Holm"

('A Description of Sixty Studies from Nature', by William Green of
Ambleside, 1810, p. 57). I cannot find any topographical allusion to a
Ghimmer-crag in contemporary local writers. Clarke, in his 'Survey of
the Lakes', does not mention it.

The Castle Rock, in the Vale of Legberthwaite, between High Fell and
Great How, is the fairy castle of Sir Walter Scott's 'Bridal of
Triermain'. "Nathdale Fell" is the ridge between Naddle Vale (Nathdale
Vale) and that of St. John, now known as High Rigg. The old Hall of
Threlkeld has long been in a state of ruinous dilapidation, the only
habitable part of it having been for many years converted into a
farmhouse. The remaining local allusions in 'The Waggoner' are obvious
enough: Castrigg is the shortened form of Castlerigg, the ridge between
Naddle Valley and Keswick.

In the "Reminiscences" of Wordsworth, which the Hon. Mr. Justice
Coleridge wrote for the late Bishop of Lincoln, in 1850, there is the
following reference to 'The Waggoner'. (See 'Memoirs', vol. ii. p. 310.)

  "'The Waggoner' seems a very favourite poem of his. He said his object
  in it had not been understood. It was a play of the fancy on a
  domestic incident, and lowly character. He wished by the opening
  descriptive lines to put his reader into the state of mind in which he
  wished it to be read. If he failed in doing that, he wished him to lay
  it down. He pointed out with the same view, the glowing lines on the
  state of exultation in which Ben and his companions are under the
  influence of liquor. Then he read the sickening languor of the morning
  walk, contrasted with the glorious uprising of Nature, and the songs
  of the birds. Here he has added about six most exquisite lines."

The lines referred to are doubtless the eight (p. 101), beginning

  'Say more; for by that power a vein,'

which were added in the edition of 1836.

The following is Sara Coleridge's criticism of 'The Waggoner'. (See
'Biographia Literaria', vol. ii. pp. 183, 184, edition 1847.)

  "Due honour is done to 'Peter Bell', at this time, by students of
  poetry in general; but some, even of Mr. Wordsworth's greatest
  admirers, do not quite satisfy me in their admiration of 'The
  Waggoner', a poem which my dear uncle, Mr. Southey, preferred even to
  the former. 'Ich will meine Denkungs Art hierin niemandem aufdringen',
  as Lessing says: I will force my way of thinking on nobody, but take
  the liberty, for my own gratification, to express it. The sketches of
  hill and valley in this poem have a lightness, and spirit--an Allegro
  touch--distinguishing them from the grave and elevated splendour which
  characterises Mr. Wordsworth's representations of Nature in general,
  and from the passive tenderness of those in 'The White Doe', while it
  harmonises well with the human interest of the piece; indeed it is the
  harmonious sweetness of the composition which is most dwelt upon by
  its special admirers. In its course it describes, with bold brief
  touches, the striking mountain tract from Grasmere to Keswick; it
  commences with an evening storm among the mountains, presents a lively
  interior of a country inn during midnight, and concludes after
  bringing us in sight of St. John's Vale and the Vale of Keswick seen
  by day-break--'Skiddaw touched with rosy light,' and the prospect from
  Nathdale Fell 'hoar with the frost-like dews of dawn:' thus giving a
  beautiful and well-contrasted Panorama, produced by the most delicate
  and masterly strokes of the pencil. Well may Mr. Ruskin, a fine
  observer and eloquent describer of various classes of natural
  appearances, speak of Mr. Wordsworth as the great poetic landscape
  painter of the age. But Mr. Ruskin has found how seldom the great
  landscape painters are powerful in expressing human passions and
  affections on canvas, or even successful in the introduction of human
  figures into their foregrounds; whereas in the poetic paintings of Mr.
  Wordsworth the landscape is always subordinate to a higher interest;
  certainly, in 'The Waggoner', the little sketch of human nature which
  occupies, as it were, the front of that encircling background, the
  picture of Benjamin and his temptations, his humble friends and the
  mute companions of his way, has a character of its own, combining with
  sportiveness a homely pathos, which must ever be delightful to some of
  those who are thoroughly conversant with the spirit of Mr.
  Wordsworth's poetry. It may be compared with the ale-house scene in
  'Tam o'Shanter', parts of Voss's Luise, or Ovid's Baucis and Philemon;
  though it differs from each of them as much as they differ from each
  other. The Epilogue carries on the feeling of the piece very
  beautifully."

The editor of Southey's 'Life and Correspondence'--his son, the Rev.
Charles Cuthbert Southey--tells us, in a note to a letter from S.T.
Coleridge to his father, that the Waggoner's name was Jackson; and that
"all the circumstances of the poem are accurately correct." This
Jackson, after retiring from active work as waggoner, became the tenant
of Greta Hall, where first Coleridge, and afterwards Southey lived. The
Hall was divided into two houses, one of which Jackson occupied, and the
other of which he let to Coleridge, who speaks thus of him in the letter
to Southey, dated Greta Hall, Keswick, April 13, 1801:

  "My landlord, who dwells next door, has a very respectable library,
  which he has put with mine; histories, encyclopedias, and all the
  modern poetry, etc. etc. etc. A more truly disinterested man I never
  met with; severely frugal, yet almost carelessly generous; and yet he
  got all his money as a common carrier, by hard labour, and by pennies
  and pennies. He is one instance among many in this country of the
  salutary effect of the love of knowledge--he was from a boy a lover of
  learning."

(See 'Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey,' vol. ii. pp. 147,
148.)

Charles Lamb--to whom 'The Waggoner' was dedicated--wrote thus to
Wordsworth on 7th June 1819:

  "My dear Wordsworth,--You cannot imagine how proud we are here of the
  dedication. We read it twice for once that we do the poem. I mean all
  through; yet 'Benjamin' is no common favourite; there is a spirit of
  beautiful tolerance in it. It is as good as it was in 1806; and it
  will be as good in 1829, if our dim eyes shall be awake to peruse it.
  Methinks there is a kind of shadowing affinity between the subject of
  the narrative and the subject of the dedication.
   ...
  "I do not know which I like best,--the prologue (the latter part
  especially) to 'P. Bell,' or the epilogue to 'Benjamin.' Yes, I tell
  stories; I do know I like the last best; and the 'Waggoner' altogether
  is a pleasanter remembrance to me than the 'Itinerant.'
  ...
  "C. LAMB."

(See 'The Letters of Charles Lamb,' edited by Alfred Ainger, vol. ii.
pp. 24-26.)

To this may be added what Southey wrote to Mr. Wade Browne on 15th June
1819:

  "I think you will be pleased with Wordsworth's 'Waggoner', if it were
  only for the line of road which it describes. The master of the waggon
  was my poor landlord Jackson, and the cause of his exchanging it for
  the one-horse cart was just as is represented in the poem; nobody but
  Benjamin could manage it upon these hills, and Benjamin could not
  resist the temptations by the wayside."

(See 'The Life and Correspondence of Robert Southey', vol. iv. p.
318.)--Ed.

THE PRELUDE,

OR, GROWTH OF A POET'S MIND;

AN AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL POEM


Composed 1799-1805.--Published 1850


ADVERTISEMENT

The following Poem was commenced in the beginning of the year 1799, and
completed in the summer of 1805.

The design and occasion of the work are described by the Author in his
Preface to the EXCURSION, first published in 1814, where he thus speaks:

  "Several years ago, when the Author retired to his native mountains
  with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might
  live, it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his
  own mind, and examine how far Nature and Education had qualified him
  for such an employment.

  "As subsidiary to this preparation, he undertook to record, in verse,
  the origin and progress of his own powers, as far as he was acquainted
  with them.

  "That work, addressed to a dear friend, most distinguished for his
  knowledge and genius, and to whom the author's intellect is deeply
  indebted, has been long finished; and the result of the investigation
  which gave rise to it, was a determination to compose a philosophical
  Poem, containing views of Man, Nature, and Society, and to be entitled
  'The Recluse;' as having for its principal subject the sensations and
  opinions of a poet living in retirement.

  "The preparatory poem is biographical, and conducts the history of the
  Author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his
  faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous
  labour which he had proposed to himself; and the two works have the
  same kind of relation to each other, if he may so express himself, as
  the Ante-chapel has to the body of a Gothic Church. Continuing this
  allusion, he may be permitted to add, that his minor pieces, which
  have been long before the public, when they shall be properly
  arranged, will be found by the attentive reader to have such
  connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to
  the little cells, oratories, and sepulchral recesses, ordinarily
  included in those edifices."

Such was the Author's language in the year 1814.

It will thence be seen, that the present Poem was intended to be
introductory to the RECLUSE, and that the RECLUSE, if completed, would
have consisted of Three Parts. Of these, the Second Part alone, viz. the
EXCURSION, was finished, and given to the world by the Author.

The First Book of the First Part of the RECLUSE still remains in
manuscript; but the Third Part was only planned. The materials of which
it would have been formed have, however, been incorporated, for the most
part, in the Author's other Publications, written subsequently to the
EXCURSION.

The Friend, to whom the present Poem is addressed, was the late SAMUEL
TAYLOR COLERIDGE, who was resident in Malta, for the restoration of his
health, when the greater part of it was composed.

Mr. Coleridge read a considerable portion of the Poem while he was
abroad; and his feelings, on hearing it recited by the Author (after his
return to his own country) are recorded in his Verses, addressed to Mr.
Wordsworth, which will be found in the 'Sibylline Leaves,' p. 197,
edition 1817, or 'Poetical Works, by S. T. Coleridge,' vol. i. p. 206.

RYDAL MOUNT, _July 13th_, 1850.


This "advertisement" to the first edition of 'The Prelude,' published in
1850--the year of Wordsworth's death--was written by Mr. Carter, who
edited the volume. Mr. Carter was for many years the poet's secretary,
and afterwards one of his literary executors. The poem was not only kept
back from publication during Wordsworth's life-time, but it remained
without a title; being alluded to by himself, when he spoke or wrote of
it, as "the poem on my own poetical education," the "poem on my own
life," etc.

As 'The Prelude' is autobiographical, a large part of Wordsworth's life
might be written in the notes appended to it; but, besides breaking up
the text of the poem unduly, this plan has many disadvantages, and would
render a subsequent and detailed life of the poet either unnecessary or
repetitive. The notes which follow will therefore be limited to the
explanation of local, historical, and chronological allusions, or to
references to Wordsworth's own career that are not obvious without them.
It has been occasionally difficult to decide whether some of the
allusions, to minute points in ancient history, mediæval mythology, and
contemporary politics, should be explained or left alone; but I have
preferred to err on the side of giving a brief clue to details, with
which every scholar is familiar.

'The Prelude' was begun as Wordsworth left the imperial city of Goslar,
in Lower Saxony, where he spent part of the last winter of last century,
and which he left on the 10th of February 1799. Only lines 1 to 45,
however, were composed at that time; and the poem was continued at
desultory intervals after the settlement at Grasmere, during 1800, and
following years. Large portions of it were dictated to his devoted
amanuenses as he walked, or sat, on the terraces of Lancrigg. Six books
were finished by 1805.

  "The seventh was begun in the opening of that year; ... and the
  remaining seven were written before the end of June 1805, when his
  friend Coleridge was in the island of Malta, for the restoration of
  his health."

(The late Bishop of Lincoln.)

There is no uncertainty as to the year in which the later books were
written; but there is considerable difficulty in fixing the precise date
of the earlier ones. Writing from Grasmere to his friend Francis
Wrangham--the letter is undated--Wordsworth says,

  "I am engaged in writing a poem on my own earlier life, which will
  take five parts or books to complete, three of which are nearly
  finished."

The late Bishop of Lincoln supposed that this letter to Wrangham was
written "at the close of 1803, or beginning of 1804." (See 'Memoirs of
Wordsworth,' vol. i. p. 303.) There is evidence that it belongs to 1804.
At the commencement of the seventh book, p. 247, he says:

  _Six changeful years_ have vanished since I first
  Poured out (saluted by that quickening breeze
  Which met me issuing from the City's walls)
  _A glad preamble to this Verse:_ I sang
  Aloud, with fervour irresistible
  Of short-lived transport, like a torrent bursting,
  From a black thunder-cloud, down Scafell's side
  To rush and disappear. But soon broke forth
  (So willed the Muse) _a less impetuous stream,
  That flowed awhile with unabating strength,
  Then stopped for years; not audible again
  Before last primrose-time._

I have _italicised_ the clauses which give some clue to the dates of
composition. From these it would appear that the "glad preamble,"
written on leaving Goslar in 1799 (which, I think, included only the
first two paragraphs of book first), was a "short-lived transport"; but
that "soon" afterwards "a less impetuous stream" broke forth, which,
after the settlement at Grasmere, "flowed awhile with unabating
strength," and then "stopped for years." Now the above passage,
recording these things, was written in 1805, and in the late autumn of
that year; (as is evident from the reference which immediately follows
to the "choir of redbreasts" and the approach of winter). We must
therefore assign the flowing of the "less impetuous stream," to 1802; in
order to leave room for the intervening "years," in which it ceased to
flow, till it was audible again in the spring of 1804, "last
primrose-time."

A second reference to date occurs in the sixth book, p. 224, entitled
"Cambridge and the Alps," in which he says,

  _Four years and thirty, told, this very week,_
  Have I been now a sojourner on earth.

This fixes definitely enough the date of the composition of _that_ part
of the work, _viz._ April 1804, which corresponds exactly to the "last
primrose-time" of the previous extract from the seventh book, in which
he tells us that after its long silence, his Muse was heard again. So
far Wordsworth's own allusions to the date of 'The Prelude.'

But there are others supplied by his own, and his sister's letters, and
also by the Grasmere Journal. In the Dove Cottage household it was
known, and talked of, as "the Poem to Coleridge;" and Dorothy records,
on 11th January 1803, that her brother was working at it. On 13th
February 1804, she writes to Mrs. Clarkson that her brother was engaged
on a poem on his own life, and was "going on with great rapidity." On
the 6th of March 1804, Wordsworth wrote from Grasmere to De Quincey,

  "I am now writing a poem on my own earlier life: I have just finished
  that part of it in which I speak of my residence at the University."
  ... It is "better than half complete, viz. four books, amounting to
  about 2500 lines."[A]

On the 24th of March, Dorothy wrote to Mrs. Clarkson, that since
Coleridge left them (which was in January 1804), her brother had added
1500 lines to the poem on his own life. On the 29th of April 1804,
Wordsworth wrote to Richard Sharpe,

  "I have been very busy these last ten weeks: having written between
  two and three thousand lines--accurately near three thousand--in that
  time; namely, four books, and a third of another. I am at present at
  the Seventh Book."

On the 25th December 1804, he wrote to Sir George Beaumont,

  "I have written upwards of 2000 verses during the last ten weeks."

We thus find that Books I. to IV. had been written by the 6th of March
1804, that from the 19th February to the 29th of April nearly 3000 lines
were written, that March and April were specially productive months, for
by the 29th April he had reached Book VII. while from 16th October to
25th December he wrote over 2000 lines.

Dorothy and Mary Wordsworth transcribed the earlier books more than
once, and a copy of some of them was given to Coleridge to take with him
to Malta.

It is certain that the remaining books of 'The Prelude' were all written
in the spring and early summer of 1805; the seventh, eighth, ninth,
tenth, eleventh, and part of the twelfth being finished about the middle
of April; the last 300 lines of book twelfth in the last week of April;
and the two remaining books--the thirteenth and fourteenth--before the
20th of May. The following extracts from letters of Wordsworth to Sir
George Beaumont make this clear, and also cast light on matters much
more important than the mere dates of composition.

  GRASMERE, Dec. 25, 1804.

  "My dear Sir George,--You will be pleased to hear that I have been
  advancing with my work: I have written upwards of 2000 verses during
  the last ten weeks. I do not know if you are exactly acquainted with
  the plan of my poetical labour: It is twofold; first, a Poem, to be
  called 'The Recluse;' in which it will be my object to express in
  verse my most interesting feelings concerning man, nature, and
  society; and next, a poem (in which I am at present chiefly engaged)
  on _my earlier life, or the growth of my own mind,_ taken up upon a
  large scale. This latter work I expect to have finished before the
  month of May; and then I purpose to fall with all my might on the
  former, which is the chief object upon which my thoughts have been
  fixed these many years. Of this poem, that of 'The Pedlar,' which
  Coleridge read to you, is part; and I may have written of it
  altogether about 2000 lines. It will consist, I hope, of about ten or
  twelve thousand."


  GRASMERE, May 1, 1805.

  "Unable to proceed with this work, [B] I turned my thoughts again to
  the 'Poem on my own Life', and you will be glad to hear that I have
  added 300 lines to it in the course of last week. Two books more will
  conclude it. It will not be much less than 9000 lines,--not hundred
  but thousand lines long,--an alarming length! and a thing
  unprecedented in literary history that a man should talk so much about
  himself. It is not self-conceit, as you will know well, that has
  induced me to do this, but real humility. I began the work because I
  was _unprepared_ to treat _any more arduous subject_, and _diffident
  of my own powers_. Here, at least, I hoped that to a certain degree I
  should be sure of succeeding, as I had nothing to do but describe what
  I had felt and thought, and therefore could not easily be bewildered.
  This might have been done in narrower compass by a man of more
  address; but I have done my best. If, when the work shall be finished,
  it appears to the judicious to have redundancies, they shall be lopped
  off, if possible; but this is very difficult to do, when a man has
  written with thought; and this defect, whenever I have suspected it or
  found it to exist in any writings of mine, I have always found it
  incurable. The fault lies too deep, and is in the first conception."


  GRASMERE, June 3, 1805.

  "I have the pleasure to say that I _finished my poem_ about a
  fortnight ago. I had looked forward to the day as a most happy one;
  ... But it was not a happy day for me; I was dejected on many
  accounts: when I looked back upon the performance, it seemed to have a
  dead weight about it,--the reality so far short of the expectation. It
  was the first long labour that I had finished; and the doubt whether I
  should ever live to write 'The Recluse', and the sense which I had of
  this poem being so far below what I seemed capable of executing,
  depressed me much; above all, many heavy thoughts of my poor departed
  brother hung upon me, the joy which I should have had in showing him
  the manuscript, and a thousand other vain fancies and dreams. I have
  spoken of this, because it was a state of feeling new to me, the
  occasion being new. This work may be considered as a sort of _portico_
  to 'The Recluse', part of the same building, which I hope to be able,
  ere long, to begin with in earnest; and if I am permitted to bring it
  to a conclusion, and to write, further, a narrative poem of the epic
  kind, I shall consider the task of my life as over. I ought to add,
  that I have the satisfaction of finding the present poem not quite of
  so alarming a length as I apprehended."


These letters explain the delay in the publication of 'The Prelude'.
They show that what led Wordsworth to write so much about himself was
not self-conceit, but self-diffidence. He felt unprepared as yet for the
more arduous task he had set before himself. He saw its faults as
clearly, or more clearly, than the critics who condemned him. He knew
that its length was excessive. He tried to condense it; he kept it
beside him unpublished, and occasionally revised it, with a view to
condensation, in vain. The text received his final corrections in the
year 1832.

Wordsworth's reluctance to publish these portions of his great poem,
'The Recluse', other than 'The Excursion', during his lifetime, was a
matter of surprise to his friends; to whom he, or the ladies of his
household, had read portions of it. In the year 1819, Charles Lamb wrote
to him,

  "If, as you say, 'The Waggoner', in some sort, came at my call, oh for
  a potent voice to call forth 'The Recluse' from his profound
  dormitory, where he sleeps forgetful of his foolish charge--the
  world!"

('The Letters of Charles Lamb', edited by Alfred Ainger, vol. ii. p.
26.)

The admission made in the letter of May 1st, 1805, is note-worthy:

  "This defect" (of redundancy) "whenever I have suspected it or found
  it to exist in any writings of mine, _I have always found incurable.
  The fault lies too deep, and is in the first conception_."

The actual result--in the Poem he had at length committed to
writing--was so far inferior to the ideal he had tried to realise, that
he could never be induced to publish it. He spoke of the MS. as forming
a sort of _portico_ to his larger work--the poem on Man, Nature, and
Society--which he meant to call 'The Recluse', and of which one portion
only, _viz._ 'The Excursion', was finished. It is clear that throughout
the composition of 'The Prelude', he felt that he was experimenting with
his powers. He wished to find out whether he could construct "a literary
work that might live," on a larger scale than his Lyrics; and it was on
the writing of a "philosophical poem," dealing with Man and Nature, in
their deepest aspects, that his thoughts had been fixed for many years.
From the letter to Sir George Beaumont, December 25, 1804, it is evident
that he regarded the autobiographical poem as a mere prologue to this
larger work, to which he hoped to turn "with all his might" after 'The
Prelude' was finished, and of which he had already written about a fifth
or a sixth (see 'Memoirs', vol. i. p. 304). This was the part known in
the Grasmere household as "The Pedlar," a title given to it from the
character of the Wanderer, but afterwards happily set aside. He did not
devote himself, however, to the completion of his wider purpose,
immediately after 'The Prelude' was finished. He wrote one book of 'The
Recluse' which he called "Home at Grasmere"; and, though detached from
'The Prelude', it is a continuation of the narrative of his own life at
the point where it is left off in the latter poem. It consists of 733
lines. Two extracts from it were published in the 'Memoirs of
Wordsworth' in 1851 (vol. i. pp. 151 and 155), beginning,

  'On Nature's invitation do I come,'

and

  'Bleak season was it, turbulent and bleak.'

These will be found in vol. ii. of this edition, pp. 118 and 121
respectively.

The autobiographical poem remained, as already stated, during
Wordsworth's lifetime without a title. The name finally adopted--'The
Prelude'--was suggested by Mrs. Wordsworth, both to indicate its
relation to the larger work, and the fact of its having been written
comparatively early.

As the poem was addressed to Coleridge, it may be desirable to add in
this place his critical verdict upon it; along with the poem which he
wrote, on hearing Wordsworth read a portion of it to him, in the winter
of 1806, at Coleorton.

In his 'Table Talk' (London, 1835, vol. ii. p. 70), Coleridge's opinion
is recorded thus:

  "I cannot help regretting that Wordsworth did not first publish his
  thirteen (fourteen) books on the growth of an individual
  mind--superior, as I used to think, upon the whole to 'The Excursion'.
  You may judge how I felt about them by my own Poem upon the occasion.
  Then the plan laid out, and, I believe, partly suggested by me, was,
  that Wordsworth should assume the station of a man in mental repose,
  one whose principles were made up, and so prepared to deliver upon
  authority a system of philosophy. He was to treat man as man,--a
  subject of eye, ear, touch, and taste in contact with external nature,
  and informing the senses from the mind, and not compounding a mind out
  of the senses; then he was to describe the pastoral and other states
  of society, assuming something of the Juvenalian spirit as he
  approached the high civilisation of cities and towns, and opening a
  melancholy picture of the present state of degeneracy and vice; thence
  he was to infer and reveal the proof of, and necessity for, the whole
  state of man and society being subject to, and illustrative of a
  redemptive process in operation, showing how this idea reconciled all
  the anomalies, and promised future glory and restoration. Something of
  this sort was, I think, agreed on. It is, in substance, what I have
  been all my life doing in my system of philosophy.

  "I think Wordsworth possessed more of the genius of a great
  Philosopher than any man I ever knew, or, as I believe, has existed in
  England since Milton; but it seems to me that he ought never to have
  abandoned the contemplative position which is peculiarly--perhaps, I
  might say exclusively--fitted for him. His proper title is 'Spectator
  ab extra'."

The following are Coleridge's Lines addressed to Wordsworth:

  TO WILLIAM WORDSWORTH

  COMPOSED ON THE NIGHT AFTER HIS RECITATION OF A POEM ON THE GROWTH OF
  AN INDIVIDUAL MIND


  Friend of the wise! and teacher of the good!
  Into my heart have I received that lay
  More than historic, that prophetic lay
  Wherein (high theme by thee first sung aright)
  Of the foundations and the building up
  Of a Human Spirit thou hast dared to tell
  What may be told, to the understanding mind
  Revealable; and what within the mind
  By vital breathings secret as the soul
  Of vernal growth, oft quickens in the heart
  Thoughts all too deep for words!--
             Theme hard as high,
  Of smiles spontaneous, and mysterious fears
  (The first-born they of Reason and twin-birth),
  Of tides obedient to external force,
  And currents self-determined, as might seem,
  Or by some inner power; of moments awful,
  Now in thy inner life, and now abroad,
  When power streamed from thee, and thy soul received
  The Light reflected, as a light bestowed--
  Of fancies fair, and milder hours of youth,
  Hyblean murmurs of poetic thought
  Industrious in its joy, in vales and glens,
  Native or outland, lakes and famous hills!
  Or on the lonely high-road, when the stars
  Were rising; or by secret mountain-streams,
  The guides and the companions of thy way!
  Of more than Fancy, of the Social Sense
  Distending wide, and man beloved as man,
  Where France in all her towns lay vibrating
  Like some becalmed bark beneath the burst
  Of Heaven's immediate thunder, when no cloud
  Is visible, or shadow on the main.
  For thou wert there, thine own brows garlanded,
  Amid the tremor of a realm aglow,
  Amid a mighty nation jubilant,
  When from the general heart of humankind
  Hope sprang forth like a full-born Deity!
--Of that dear Hope afflicted and struck down,
  So summoned homeward, thenceforth calm and sure,
  From the dread watch-tower of man's absolute self,
  With light unwaning on her eyes, to look
  Far on--herself a glory to behold.
  The Angel of the vision! Then (last strain)
  Of Duty, chosen laws controlling choice,
  Action and joy!--An Orphic song indeed,
  A song divine of high and passionate thoughts
  To their own music chanted!
                             O great Bard!
  Ere yet that last strain dying awed the air,
  With stedfast eye I viewed thee in the choir
  Of ever-enduring men. The truly great
  Have all one age, and from one visible space
  Shed influence! They, both in power and act,
  Are permanent, and Time is not with them,
  Save as it worketh for them, they in it.
  Nor less a sacred roll, than those of old,
  And to be placed, as they, with gradual fame
  Among the archives of mankind, thy work
  Makes audible a linked lay of Truth,
  Of Truth profound a sweet continuous lay,
  Not learnt, but native, her own natural notes!
  Ah! as I listened with a heart forlorn,
  The pulses of my being beat anew:
  And even as life returns upon the drowned,
  Life's joy rekindling roused a throng of pains--
  Keen pangs of Love, awakening as a babe
  Turbulent, with an outcry in the heart;
  And fears self-willed, that shunned the eye of hope;
  And hope that scarce would know itself from fear;
  Sense of past youth, and manhood come in vain,
  And genius given, and knowledge won in vain;
  And all which I had culled in wood-walks wild,
  And all which patient toil had reared, and all,
  Commune with thee had opened out--but flowers
  Strewed on my corse, and borne upon my bier,
  In the same coffin, for the self-same grave!

  ...   Eve following eve,
  Dear tranquil time, when the sweet sense of Home
  Is sweetest! moments for their own sake hailed,
  And more desired, more precious for thy song,
  In silence listening, like a devout child,
  My soul lay passive, by thy various strain
  Driven as in surges now beneath the stars,
  With momentary stars of my own birth,
  Fair constellated foam, [C] still darting off
  Into the darkness; now a tranquil sea,
  Outspread and bright, yet swelling to the moon.

    And when--O Friend! my comforter and guide!
  Strong in thyself, and powerful to give strength!--
  Thy long-sustained Song finally closed,
  And thy deep voice had ceased--yet thou thyself
  Wert still before my eyes, and round us both
  That happy vision of beloved faces--
  Scarce conscious, and yet conscious of its close
  I sate, my being blended in one thought
  (Thought was it? or aspiration? or resolve?)
  Absorbed, yet hanging still upon the sound--
  And when I rose I found myself in prayer.


It was at Coleorton, in Leicestershire,--where the Wordsworths lived
during the winter of 1806-7, in a farm-house belonging to Sir George
Beaumont, and where Coleridge visited them,--that 'The Prelude' was read
aloud by its author, on the occasion which gave birth to these
lines.--Ed.

  "A beautiful white cloud of foam at momentary intervals, coursed by

  and sparkled and went out in it: and every now and then light

  side, each with its own small constellation, over the sea, and scoured
  out of sight like a Tartar troop over a wilderness."
