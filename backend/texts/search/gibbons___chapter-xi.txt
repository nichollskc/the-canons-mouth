Chapter XI: Reign Of Claudius, Defeat Of The Goths.—Part II.

      The death of Claudius had revived the fainting spirit of the
      Goths. The troops which guarded the passes of Mount Hæmus, and
      the banks of the Danube, had been drawn away by the apprehension
      of a civil war; and it seems probable that the remaining body of
      the Gothic and Vandalic tribes embraced the favorable
      opportunity, abandoned their settlements of the Ukraine,
      traversed the rivers, and swelled with new multitudes the
      destroying host of their countrymen. Their united numbers were at
      length encountered by Aurelian, and the bloody and doubtful
      conflict ended only with the approach of night. 20 Exhausted by
      so many calamities, which they had mutually endured and inflicted
      during a twenty years’ war, the Goths and the Romans consented to
      a lasting and beneficial treaty. It was earnestly solicited by
      the barbarians, and cheerfully ratified by the legions, to whose
      suffrage the prudence of Aurelian referred the decision of that
      important question. The Gothic nation engaged to supply the
      armies of Rome with a body of two thousand auxiliaries,
      consisting entirely of cavalry, and stipulated in return an
      undisturbed retreat, with a regular market as far as the Danube,
      provided by the emperor’s care, but at their own expense. The
      treaty was observed with such religious fidelity, that when a
      party of five hundred men straggled from the camp in quest of
      plunder, the king or general of the barbarians commanded that the
      guilty leader should be apprehended and shot to death with darts,
      as a victim devoted to the sanctity of their engagements. 201 It
      is, however, not unlikely, that the precaution of Aurelian, who
      had exacted as hostages the sons and daughters of the Gothic
      chiefs, contributed something to this pacific temper. The youths
      he trained in the exercise of arms, and near his own person: to
      the damsels he gave a liberal and Roman education, and by
      bestowing them in marriage on some of his principal officers,
      gradually introduced between the two nations the closest and most
      endearing connections. 21

      21 (return) [ Dexipphus (ap. Excerpta Legat. p. 12) relates the
      whole transaction under the name of Vandals. Aurelian married one
      of the Gothic ladies to his general Bonosus, who was able to
      drink with the Goths and discover their secrets. Hist. August. p.
      247.]

      But the most important condition of peace was understood rather
      than expressed in the treaty. Aurelian withdrew the Roman forces
      from Dacia, and tacitly relinquished that great province to the
      Goths and Vandals. 22 His manly judgment convinced him of the
      solid advantages, and taught him to despise the seeming disgrace,
      of thus contracting the frontiers of the monarchy. The Dacian
      subjects, removed from those distant possessions which they were
      unable to cultivate or defend, added strength and populousness to
      the southern side of the Danube. A fertile territory, which the
      repetition of barbarous inroads had changed into a desert, was
      yielded to their industry, and a new province of Dacia still
      preserved the memory of Trajan’s conquests. The old country of
      that name detained, however, a considerable number of its
      inhabitants, who dreaded exile more than a Gothic master. 23
      These degenerate Romans continued to serve the empire, whose
      allegiance they had renounced, by introducing among their
      conquerors the first notions of agriculture, the useful arts, and
      the conveniences of civilized life. An intercourse of commerce
      and language was gradually established between the opposite banks
      of the Danube; and after Dacia became an independent state, it
      often proved the firmest barrier of the empire against the
      invasions of the savages of the North. A sense of interest
      attached these more settled barbarians to the alliance of Rome,
      and a permanent interest very frequently ripens into sincere and
      useful friendship. This various colony, which filled the ancient
      province, and was insensibly blended into one great people, still
      acknowledged the superior renown and authority of the Gothic
      tribe, and claimed the fancied honor of a Scandinavian origin. At
      the same time, the lucky though accidental resemblance of the
      name of Getæ, 231 infused among the credulous Goths a vain
      persuasion, that in a remote age, their own ancestors, already
      seated in the Dacian provinces, had received the instructions of
      Zamolxis, and checked the victorious arms of Sesostris and
      Darius. 24

      While the vigorous and moderate conduct of Aurelian restored the
      Illyrian frontier, the nation of the Alemanni 25 violated the
      conditions of peace, which either Gallienus had purchased, or
      Claudius had imposed, and, inflamed by their impatient youth,
      suddenly flew to arms. Forty thousand horse appeared in the
      field, 26 and the numbers of the infantry doubled those of the
      cavalry. 27 The first objects of their avarice were a few cities
      of the Rhætian frontier; but their hopes soon rising with
      success, the rapid march of the Alemanni traced a line of
      devastation from the Danube to the Po. 28

      they mean the same people, and the same war; but it requires some
      care to conciliate and explain them.]

      28 (return) [ In Dexippus, we at present read Rhodanus: M. de
      Valois very judiciously alters the word to Eridanus.]

      The emperor was almost at the same time informed of the
      irruption, and of the retreat, of the barbarians. Collecting an
      active body of troops, he marched with silence and celerity along
      the skirts of the Hercynian forest; and the Alemanni, laden with
      the spoils of Italy, arrived at the Danube, without suspecting,
      that on the opposite bank, and in an advantageous post, a Roman
      army lay concealed and prepared to intercept their return.
      Aurelian indulged the fatal security of the barbarians, and
      permitted about half their forces to pass the river without
      disturbance and without precaution. Their situation and
      astonishment gave him an easy victory; his skilful conduct
      improved the advantage. Disposing the legions in a semicircular
      form, he advanced the two horns of the crescent across the
      Danube, and wheeling them on a sudden towards the centre,
      enclosed the rear of the German host. The dismayed barbarians, on
      whatsoever side they cast their eyes, beheld, with despair, a
      wasted country, a deep and rapid stream, a victorious and
      implacable enemy.

      Reduced to this distressed condition, the Alemanni no longer
      disdained to sue for peace. Aurelian received their ambassadors
      at the head of his camp, and with every circumstance of martial
      pomp that could display the greatness and discipline of Rome. The
      legions stood to their arms in well-ordered ranks and awful
      silence. The principal commanders, distinguished by the ensigns
      of their rank, appeared on horseback on either side of the
      Imperial throne. Behind the throne the consecrated images of the
      emperor, and his predecessors, 29 the golden eagles, and the
      various titles of the legions, engraved in letters of gold, were
      exalted in the air on lofty pikes covered with silver. When
      Aurelian assumed his seat, his manly grace and majestic figure 30
      taught the barbarians to revere the person as well as the purple
      of their conqueror. The ambassadors fell prostrate on the ground
      in silence. They were commanded to rise, and permitted to speak.
      By the assistance of interpreters they extenuated their perfidy,
      magnified their exploits, expatiated on the vicissitudes of
      fortune and the advantages of peace, and, with an ill-timed
      confidence, demanded a large subsidy, as the price of the
      alliance which they offered to the Romans. The answer of the
      emperor was stern and imperious. He treated their offer with
      contempt, and their demand with indignation, reproached the
      barbarians, that they were as ignorant of the arts of war as of
      the laws of peace, and finally dismissed them with the choice
      only of submitting to this unconditional mercy, or awaiting the
      utmost severity of his resentment. 31 Aurelian had resigned a
      distant province to the Goths; but it was dangerous to trust or
      to pardon these perfidious barbarians, whose formidable power
      kept Italy itself in perpetual alarms.

      29 (return) [ The emperor Claudius was certainly of the number;
      but we are ignorant how far this mark of respect was extended; if
      to Cæsar and Augustus, it must have produced a very awful
      spectacle; a long line of the masters of the world.]

      31 (return) [ Dexippus gives them a subtle and prolix oration,

      Immediately after this conference, it should seem that some
      unexpected emergency required the emperor’s presence in Pannonia.

      He devolved on his lieutenants the care of finishing the
      destruction of the Alemanni, either by the sword, or by the surer
      operation of famine. But an active despair has often triumphed
      over the indolent assurance of success. The barbarians, finding
      it impossible to traverse the Danube and the Roman camp, broke
      through the posts in their rear, which were more feebly or less
      carefully guarded; and with incredible diligence, but by a
      different road, returned towards the mountains of Italy. 32
      Aurelian, who considered the war as totally extinguished,
      received the mortifying intelligence of the escape of the
      Alemanni, and of the ravage which they already committed in the
      territory of Milan. The legions were commanded to follow, with as
      much expedition as those heavy bodies were capable of exerting,
      the rapid flight of an enemy whose infantry and cavalry moved
      with almost equal swiftness. A few days afterwards, the emperor
      himself marched to the relief of Italy, at the head of a chosen
      body of auxiliaries, (among whom were the hostages and cavalry of
      the Vandals,) and of all the Prætorian guards who had served in
      the wars on the Danube. 33

      As the light troops of the Alemanni had spread themselves from
      the Alps to the Apennine, the incessant vigilance of Aurelian and
      his officers was exercised in the discovery, the attack, and the
      pursuit of the numerous detachments. Notwithstanding this
      desultory war, three considerable battles are mentioned, in which
      the principal force of both armies was obstinately engaged. 34
      The success was various. In the first, fought near Placentia, the
      Romans received so severe a blow, that, according to the
      expression of a writer extremely partial to Aurelian, the
      immediate dissolution of the empire was apprehended. 35 The
      crafty barbarians, who had lined the woods, suddenly attacked the
      legions in the dusk of the evening, and, it is most probable,
      after the fatigue and disorder of a long march.

      The fury of their charge was irresistible; but, at length, after
      a dreadful slaughter, the patient firmness of the emperor rallied
      his troops, and restored, in some degree, the honor of his arms.
      The second battle was fought near Fano in Umbria; on the spot
      which, five hundred years before, had been fatal to the brother
      of Hannibal. 36 Thus far the successful Germans had advanced
      along the Æmilian and Flaminian way, with a design of sacking the
      defenceless mistress of the world. But Aurelian, who, watchful
      for the safety of Rome, still hung on their rear, found in this
      place the decisive moment of giving them a total and
      irretrievable defeat. 37 The flying remnant of their host was
      exterminated in a third and last battle near Pavia; and Italy was
      delivered from the inroads of the Alemanni.

      Fear has been the original parent of superstition, and every new
      calamity urges trembling mortals to deprecate the wrath of their
      invisible enemies. Though the best hope of the republic was in
      the valor and conduct of Aurelian, yet such was the public
      consternation, when the barbarians were hourly expected at the
      gates of Rome, that, by a decree of the senate the Sibylline
      books were consulted. Even the emperor himself, from a motive
      either of religion or of policy, recommended this salutary
      measure, chided the tardiness of the senate, 38 and offered to
      supply whatever expense, whatever animals, whatever captives of
      any nation, the gods should require. Notwithstanding this liberal
      offer, it does not appear, that any human victims expiated with
      their blood the sins of the Roman people. The Sibylline books
      enjoined ceremonies of a more harmless nature, processions of
      priests in white robes, attended by a chorus of youths and
      virgins; lustrations of the city and adjacent country; and
      sacrifices, whose powerful influence disabled the barbarians from
      passing the mystic ground on which they had been celebrated.
      However puerile in themselves, these superstitious arts were
      subservient to the success of the war; and if, in the decisive
      battle of Fano, the Alemanni fancied they saw an army of spectres
      combating on the side of Aurelian, he received a real and
      effectual aid from this imaginary reënforcement. 39

      38 (return) [ One should imagine, he said, that you were

      39 (return) [ Vopiscus, in Hist. August. p. 215, 216, gives a
      long account of these ceremonies from the Registers of the
      senate.]

      But whatever confidence might be placed in ideal ramparts, the
      experience of the past, and the dread of the future, induced the
      Romans to construct fortifications of a grosser and more
      substantial kind. The seven hills of Rome had been surrounded by
      the successors of Romulus with an ancient wall of more than
      thirteen miles. 40 The vast enclosure may seem disproportioned to
      the strength and numbers of the infant-state. But it was
      necessary to secure an ample extent of pasture and arable land
      against the frequent and sudden incursions of the tribes of
      Latium, the perpetual enemies of the republic. With the progress
      of Roman greatness, the city and its inhabitants gradually
      increased, filled up the vacant space, pierced through the
      useless walls, covered the field of Mars, and, on every side,
      followed the public highways in long and beautiful suburbs. 41
      The extent of the new walls, erected by Aurelian, and finished in
      the reign of Probus, was magnified by popular estimation to near
      fifty, 42 but is reduced by accurate measurement to about
      twenty-one miles. 43 It was a great but a melancholy labor, since
      the defence of the capital betrayed the decline of monarchy. The
      Romans of a more prosperous age, who trusted to the arms of the
      legions the safety of the frontier camps, 44 were very far from
      entertaining a suspicion that it would ever become necessary to
      fortify the seat of empire against the inroads of the barbarians.

      The victory of Claudius over the Goths, and the success of
      Aurelian against the Alemanni, had already restored to the arms
      of Rome their ancient superiority over the barbarous nations of
      the North. To chastise domestic tyrants, and to reunite the
      dismembered parts of the empire, was a task reserved for the
      second of those warlike emperors. Though he was acknowledged by
      the senate and people, the frontiers of Italy, Africa, Illyricum,
      and Thrace, confined the limits of his reign. Gaul, Spain, and
      Britain, Egypt, Syria, and Asia Minor, were still possessed by
      two rebels, who alone, out of so numerous a list, had hitherto
      escaped the dangers of their situation; and to complete the
      ignominy of Rome, these rival thrones had been usurped by women.

      A rapid succession of monarchs had arisen and fallen in the
      provinces of Gaul. The rigid virtues of Posthumus served only to
      hasten his destruction. After suppressing a competitor, who had
      assumed the purple at Mentz, he refused to gratify his troops
      with the plunder of the rebellious city; and in the seventh year
      of his reign, became the victim of their disappointed avarice. 46
      The death of Victorinus, his friend and associate, was occasioned
      by a less worthy cause. The shining accomplishments 47 of that
      prince were stained by a licentious passion, which he indulged in
      acts of violence, with too little regard to the laws of society,
      or even to those of love. 48 He was slain at Cologne, by a
      conspiracy of jealous husbands, whose revenge would have appeared
      more justifiable, had they spared the innocence of his son. After
      the murder of so many valiant princes, it is somewhat remarkable,
      that a female for a long time controlled the fierce legions of
      Gaul, and still more singular, that she was the mother of the
      unfortunate Victorinus. The arts and treasures of Victoria
      enabled her successively to place Marius and Tetricus on the
      throne, and to reign with a manly vigor under the name of those
      dependent emperors. Money of copper, of silver, and of gold, was
      coined in her name; she assumed the titles of Augusta and Mother
      of the Camps: her power ended only with her life; but her life
      was perhaps shortened by the ingratitude of Tetricus. 49

      When, at the instigation of his ambitious patroness, Tetricus
      assumed the ensigns of royalty, he was governor of the peaceful
      province of Aquitaine, an employment suited to his character and
      education. He reigned four or five years over Gaul, Spain, and
      Britain, the slave and sovereign of a licentious army, whom he
      dreaded, and by whom he was despised. The valor and fortune of
      Aurelian at length opened the prospect of a deliverance. He
      ventured to disclose his melancholy situation, and conjured the
      emperor to hasten to the relief of his unhappy rival. Had this
      secret correspondence reached the ears of the soldiers, it would
      most probably have cost Tetricus his life; nor could he resign
      the sceptre of the West without committing an act of treason
      against himself. He affected the appearances of a civil war, led
      his forces into the field, against Aurelian, posted them in the
      most disadvantageous manner, betrayed his own counsels to his
      enemy, and with a few chosen friends deserted in the beginning of
      the action. The rebel legions, though disordered and dismayed by
      the unexpected treachery of their chief, defended themselves with
      desperate valor, till they were cut in pieces almost to a man, in
      this bloody and memorable battle, which was fought near Chalons
      in Champagne. 50 The retreat of the irregular auxiliaries, Franks
      and Batavians, 51 whom the conqueror soon compelled or persuaded
      to repass the Rhine, restored the general tranquillity, and the
      power of Aurelian was acknowledged from the wall of Antoninus to
      the columns of Hercules.

      Lyons, on the contrary, had resisted with obstinate disaffection
      the arms of Aurelian. We read of the punishment of Lyons, 53 but
      there is not any mention of the rewards of Autun. Such, indeed,
      is the policy of civil war: severely to remember injuries, and to
      forget the most important services. Revenge is profitable,
      gratitude is expensive.

      Aurelian had no sooner secured the person and provinces of
      Tetricus, than he turned his arms against Zenobia, the celebrated
      queen of Palmyra and the East. Modern Europe has produced several
      illustrious women who have sustained with glory the weight of
      empire; nor is our own age destitute of such distinguished
      characters. But if we except the doubtful achievements of
      Semiramis, Zenobia is perhaps the only female whose superior
      genius broke through the servile indolence imposed on her sex by
      the climate and manners of Asia. 54 She claimed her descent from
      the Macedonian kings of Egypt, 541 equalled in beauty her
      ancestor Cleopatra, and far surpassed that princess in chastity
      55 and valor. Zenobia was esteemed the most lovely as well as the
      most heroic of her sex. She was of a dark complexion (for in
      speaking of a lady these trifles become important). Her teeth
      were of a pearly whiteness, and her large black eyes sparkled
      with uncommon fire, tempered by the most attractive sweetness.
      Her voice was strong and harmonious. Her manly understanding was
      strengthened and adorned by study. She was not ignorant of the
      Latin tongue, but possessed in equal perfection the Greek, the
      Syriac, and the Egyptian languages. She had drawn up for her own
      use an epitome of oriental history, and familiarly compared the
      beauties of Homer and Plato under the tuition of the sublime
      Longinus.

      Odenathus and Zenobia is taken from their lives in the Augustan

      55 (return) [ She never admitted her husband’s embraces but for
      the sake of posterity. If her hopes were baffled, in the ensuing
      month she reiterated the experiment.]

      This accomplished woman gave her hand to Odenathus, 551 who, from
      a private station, raised himself to the dominion of the East.
      She soon became the friend and companion of a hero. In the
      intervals of war, Odenathus passionately delighted in the
      exercise of hunting; he pursued with ardor the wild beasts of the
      desert, lions, panthers, and bears; and the ardor of Zenobia in
      that dangerous amusement was not inferior to his own. She had
      inured her constitution to fatigue, disdained the use of a
      covered carriage, generally appeared on horseback in a military
      habit, and sometimes marched several miles on foot at the head of
      the troops. The success of Odenathus was in a great measure
      ascribed to her incomparable prudence and fortitude. Their
      splendid victories over the Great King, whom they twice pursued
      as far as the gates of Ctesiphon, laid the foundations of their
      united fame and power. The armies which they commanded, and the
      provinces which they had saved, acknowledged not any other
      sovereigns than their invincible chiefs. The senate and people of
      Rome revered a stranger who had avenged their captive emperor,
      and even the insensible son of Valerian accepted Odenathus for
      his legitimate colleague.

      Chapter XI: Reign Of Claudius, Defeat Of The Goths.—Part III.

      After a successful expedition against the Gothic plunderers of
      Asia, the Palmyrenian prince returned to the city of Emesa in
      Syria. Invincible in war, he was there cut off by domestic
      treason, and his favorite amusement of hunting was the cause, or
      at least the occasion, of his death. 56 His nephew Mæonius
      presumed to dart his javelin before that of his uncle; and though
      admonished of his error, repeated the same insolence. As a
      monarch, and as a sportsman, Odenathus was provoked, took away
      his horse, a mark of ignominy among the barbarians, and chastised
      the rash youth by a short confinement. The offence was soon
      forgot, but the punishment was remembered; and Mæonius, with a
      few daring associates, assassinated his uncle in the midst of a
      great entertainment. Herod, the son of Odenathus, though not of
      Zenobia, a young man of a soft and effeminate temper, 57 was
      killed with his father. But Mæonius obtained only the pleasure of
      revenge by this bloody deed. He had scarcely time to assume the
      title of Augustus, before he was sacrificed by Zenobia to the
      memory of her husband. 58

      57 (return) [ Odenathus and Zenobia often sent him, from the
      spoils of the enemy, presents of gems and toys, which he received
      with infinite delight.]

      58 (return) [ Some very unjust suspicions have been cast on
      Zenobia, as if she was accessory to her husband’s death.]

      With the assistance of his most faithful friends, she immediately
      filled the vacant throne, and governed with manly counsels
      Palmyra, Syria, and the East, above five years. By the death of
      Odenathus, that authority was at an end which the senate had
      granted him only as a personal distinction; but his martial
      widow, disdaining both the senate and Gallienus, obliged one of
      the Roman generals, who was sent against her, to retreat into
      Europe, with the loss of his army and his reputation. 59 Instead
      of the little passions which so frequently perplex a female
      reign, the steady administration of Zenobia was guided by the
      most judicious maxims of policy. If it was expedient to pardon,
      she could calm her resentment; if it was necessary to punish, she
      could impose silence on the voice of pity. Her strict economy was
      accused of avarice; yet on every proper occasion she appeared
      magnificent and liberal. The neighboring states of Arabia,
      Armenia, and Persia, dreaded her enmity, and solicited her
      alliance. To the dominions of Odenathus, which extended from the
      Euphrates to the frontiers of Bithynia, his widow added the
      inheritance of her ancestors, the populous and fertile kingdom of
      Egypt. 60 The emperor Claudius acknowledged her merit, and was
      content, that, while _he_ pursued the Gothic war, _she_ should
      assert the dignity of the empire in the East. The conduct,
      however, of Zenobia was attended with some ambiguity; not is it
      unlikely that she had conceived the design of erecting an
      independent and hostile monarchy. She blended with the popular
      manners of Roman princes the stately pomp of the courts of Asia,
      and exacted from her subjects the same adoration that was paid to
      the successor of Cyrus. She bestowed on her three sons 61 a Latin
      education, and often showed them to the troops adorned with the
      Imperial purple. For herself she reserved the diadem, with the
      splendid but doubtful title of Queen of the East.

      60 (return) [ See, in Hist. August. p. 198, Aurelian’s testimony
      to her merit; and for the conquest of Egypt, Zosimus, l. i. p.
      39, 40.] This seems very doubtful. Claudius, during all his
      reign, is represented as emperor on the medals of Alexandria,
      which are very numerous. If Zenobia possessed any power in Egypt,
      it could only have been at the beginning of the reign of
      Aurelian. The same circumstance throws great improbability on her
      conquests in Galatia. Perhaps Zenobia administered Egypt in the
      name of Claudius, and emboldened by the death of that prince,
      subjected it to her own power.—G.]

      61 (return) [ Timolaus, Herennianus, and Vaballathus. It is

      the last, Aurelian bestowed a small province of Armenia, with the
      title of King; several of his medals are still extant. See
      Tillemont, tom. 3, p. 1190.]

      When Aurelian passed over into Asia, against an adversary whose
      sex alone could render her an object of contempt, his presence
      restored obedience to the province of Bithynia, already shaken by
      the arms and intrigues of Zenobia. 62 Advancing at the head of
      his legions, he accepted the submission of Ancyra, and was
      admitted into Tyana, after an obstinate siege, by the help of a
      perfidious citizen. The generous though fierce temper of Aurelian
      abandoned the traitor to the rage of the soldiers; a
      superstitious reverence induced him to treat with lenity the
      countrymen of Apollonius the philosopher. 63 Antioch was deserted
      on his approach, till the emperor, by his salutary edicts,
      recalled the fugitives, and granted a general pardon to all who,
      from necessity rather than choice, had been engaged in the
      service of the Palmyrenian Queen. The unexpected mildness of such
      a conduct reconciled the minds of the Syrians, and as far as the
      gates of Emesa, the wishes of the people seconded the terror of
      his arms. 64

      of Tyana was born about the same time as Jesus Christ. His life
      (that of the former) is related in so fabulous a manner by his
      disciples, that we are at a loss to discover whether he was a
      sage, an impostor, or a fanatic.]

      64 (return) [ Zosimus, l. i. p. 46.]

      Zenobia would have ill deserved her reputation, had she
      indolently permitted the emperor of the West to approach within a
      hundred miles of her capital. The fate of the East was decided in
      two great battles; so similar in almost every circumstance, that
      we can scarcely distinguish them from each other, except by
      observing that the first was fought near Antioch, 65 and the
      second near Emesa. 66 In both the queen of Palmyra animated the
      armies by her presence, and devolved the execution of her orders
      on Zabdas, who had already signalized his military talents by the
      conquest of Egypt. The numerous forces of Zenobia consisted for
      the most part of light archers, and of heavy cavalry clothed in
      complete steel. The Moorish and Illyrian horse of Aurelian were
      unable to sustain the ponderous charge of their antagonists. They
      fled in real or affected disorder, engaged the Palmyrenians in a
      laborious pursuit, harassed them by a desultory combat, and at
      length discomfited this impenetrable but unwieldy body of
      cavalry. The light infantry, in the mean time, when they had
      exhausted their quivers, remaining without protection against a
      closer onset, exposed their naked sides to the swords of the
      legions. Aurelian had chosen these veteran troops, who were
      usually stationed on the Upper Danube, and whose valor had been
      severely tried in the Alemannic war. 67 After the defeat of
      Emesa, Zenobia found it impossible to collect a third army. As
      far as the frontier of Egypt, the nations subject to her empire
      had joined the standard of the conqueror, who detached Probus,
      the bravest of his generals, to possess himself of the Egyptian
      provinces. Palmyra was the last resource of the widow of
      Odenathus. She retired within the walls of her capital, made
      every preparation for a vigorous resistance, and declared, with
      the intrepidity of a heroine, that the last moment of her reign
      and of her life should be the same.

      battles is clear and circumstantial.]

      Amid the barren deserts of Arabia, a few cultivated spots rise
      like islands out of the sandy ocean. Even the name of Tadmor, or
      Palmyra, by its signification in the Syriac as well as in the
      Latin language, denoted the multitude of palm-trees which
      afforded shade and verdure to that temperate region. The air was
      pure, and the soil, watered by some invaluable springs, was
      capable of producing fruits as well as corn. A place possessed of
      such singular advantages, and situated at a convenient distance
      68 between the Gulf of Persia and the Mediterranean, was soon
      frequented by the caravans which conveyed to the nations of
      Europe a considerable part of the rich commodities of India.
      Palmyra insensibly increased into an opulent and independent
      city, and connecting the Roman and the Parthian monarchies by the
      mutual benefits of commerce, was suffered to observe an humble
      neutrality, till at length, after the victories of Trajan, the
      little republic sunk into the bosom of Rome, and flourished more
      than one hundred and fifty years in the subordinate though
      honorable rank of a colony. It was during that peaceful period,
      if we may judge from a few remaining inscriptions, that the
      wealthy Palmyrenians constructed those temples, palaces, and
      porticos of Grecian architecture, whose ruins, scattered over an
      extent of several miles, have deserved the curiosity of our
      travellers. The elevation of Odenathus and Zenobia appeared to
      reflect new splendor on their country, and Palmyra, for a while,
      stood forth the rival of Rome: but the competition was fatal, and
      ages of prosperity were sacrificed to a moment of glory. 69

      ruins of Palmyra about the end of the last century. Our curiosity
      has since been gratified in a more splendid manner by Messieurs
      Wood and Dawkins. For the history of Palmyra, we may consult the
      masterly dissertation of Dr. Halley in the Philosophical
      Transactions: Lowthorp’s Abridgment, vol. iii. p. 518.]

      In his march over the sandy desert between Emesa and Palmyra, the
      emperor Aurelian was perpetually harassed by the Arabs; nor could
      he always defend his army, and especially his baggage, from those
      flying troops of active and daring robbers, who watched the
      moment of surprise, and eluded the slow pursuit of the legions.
      The siege of Palmyra was an object far more difficult and
      important, and the emperor, who, with incessant vigor, pressed
      the attacks in person, was himself wounded with a dart. “The
      Roman people,” says Aurelian, in an original letter, “speak with
      contempt of the war which I am waging against a woman. They are
      ignorant both of the character and of the power of Zenobia. It is
      impossible to enumerate her warlike preparations, of stones, of
      arrows, and of every species of missile weapons. Every part of
      the walls is provided with two or three _balistæ_ and artificial
      fires are thrown from her military engines. The fear of
      punishment has armed her with a desperate courage. Yet still I
      trust in the protecting deities of Rome, who have hitherto been
      favorable to all my undertakings.” 70 Doubtful, however, of the
      protection of the gods, and of the event of the siege, Aurelian
      judged it more prudent to offer terms of an advantageous
      capitulation; to the queen, a splendid retreat; to the citizens,
      their ancient privileges. His proposals were obstinately
      rejected, and the refusal was accompanied with insult.

      70 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 218.]

      The firmness of Zenobia was supported by the hope, that in a very
      short time famine would compel the Roman army to repass the
      desert; and by the reasonable expectation that the kings of the
      East, and particularly the Persian monarch, would arm in the
      defence of their most natural ally. But fortune, and the
      perseverance of Aurelian, overcame every obstacle. The death of
      Sapor, which happened about this time, 71 distracted the councils
      of Persia, and the inconsiderable succors that attempted to
      relieve Palmyra were easily intercepted either by the arms or the
      liberality of the emperor. From every part of Syria, a regular
      succession of convoys safely arrived in the camp, which was
      increased by the return of Probus with his victorious troops from
      the conquest of Egypt. It was then that Zenobia resolved to fly.
      She mounted the fleetest of her dromedaries, 72 and had already
      reached the banks of the Euphrates, about sixty miles from
      Palmyra, when she was overtaken by the pursuit of Aurelian’s
      light horse, seized, and brought back a captive to the feet of
      the emperor. Her capital soon afterwards surrendered, and was
      treated with unexpected lenity. The arms, horses, and camels,
      with an immense treasure of gold, silver, silk, and precious
      stones, were all delivered to the conqueror, who, leaving only a
      garrison of six hundred archers, returned to Emesa, and employed
      some time in the distribution of rewards and punishments at the
      end of so memorable a war, which restored to the obedience of
      Rome those provinces that had renounced their allegiance since
      the captivity of Valerian.

      When the Syrian queen was brought into the presence of Aurelian,
      he sternly asked her, How she had presumed to rise in arms
      against the emperors of Rome! The answer of Zenobia was a prudent
      mixture of respect and firmness. “Because I disdained to consider
      as Roman emperors an Aureolus or a Gallienus. You alone I
      acknowledge as my conqueror and my sovereign.” 73 But as female
      fortitude is commonly artificial, so it is seldom steady or
      consistent. The courage of Zenobia deserted her in the hour of
      trial; she trembled at the angry clamors of the soldiers, who
      called aloud for her immediate execution, forgot the generous
      despair of Cleopatra, which she had proposed as her model, and
      ignominiously purchased life by the sacrifice of her fame and her
      friends. It was to their counsels, which governed the weakness of
      her sex, that she imputed the guilt of her obstinate resistance;
      it was on their heads that she directed the vengeance of the
      cruel Aurelian. The fame of Longinus, who was included among the
      numerous and perhaps innocent victims of her fear, will survive
      that of the queen who betrayed, or the tyrant who condemned him.
      Genius and learning were incapable of moving a fierce unlettered
      soldier, but they had served to elevate and harmonize the soul of
      Longinus. Without uttering a complaint, he calmly followed the
      executioner, pitying his unhappy mistress, and bestowing comfort
      on his afflicted friends. 74

      Returning from the conquest of the East, Aurelian had already
      crossed the Straits which divided Europe from Asia, when he was
      provoked by the intelligence that the Palmyrenians had massacred
      the governor and garrison which he had left among them, and again
      erected the standard of revolt. Without a moment’s deliberation,
      he once more turned his face towards Syria. Antioch was alarmed
      by his rapid approach, and the helpless city of Palmyra felt the
      irresistible weight of his resentment. We have a letter of
      Aurelian himself, in which he acknowledges, 75 that old men,
      women, children, and peasants, had been involved in that dreadful
      execution, which should have been confined to armed rebellion;
      and although his principal concern seems directed to the
      reëstablishment of a temple of the Sun, he discovers some pity
      for the remnant of the Palmyrenians, to whom he grants the
      permission of rebuilding and inhabiting their city. But it is
      easier to destroy than to restore. The seat of commerce, of arts,
      and of Zenobia, gradually sunk into an obscure town, a trifling
      fortress, and at length a miserable village. The present citizens
      of Palmyra, consisting of thirty or forty families, have erected
      their mud cottages within the spacious court of a magnificent
      temple.

      75 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 219.]

      Another and a last labor still awaited the indefatigable
      Aurelian; to suppress a dangerous though obscure rebel, who,
      during the revolt of Palmyra, had arisen on the banks of the
      Nile. Firmus, the friend and ally, as he proudly styled himself,
      of Odenathus and Zenobia, was no more than a wealthy merchant of
      Egypt. In the course of his trade to India, he had formed very
      intimate connections with the Saracens and the Blemmyes, whose
      situation on either coast of the Red Sea gave them an easy
      introduction into the Upper Egypt. The Egyptians he inflamed with
      the hope of freedom, and, at the head of their furious multitude,
      broke into the city of Alexandria, where he assumed the Imperial
      purple, coined money, published edicts, and raised an army,
      which, as he vainly boasted, he was capable of maintaining from
      the sole profits of his paper trade. Such troops were a feeble
      defence against the approach of Aurelian; and it seems almost
      unnecessary to relate, that Firmus was routed, taken, tortured,
      and put to death. 76 Aurelian might now congratulate the senate,
      the people, and himself, that in little more than three years, he
      had restored universal peace and order to the Roman world.

      76 (return) [ See Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 220, 242. As an
      instance of luxury, it is observed, that he had glass windows. He
      was remarkable for his strength and appetite, his courage and
      dexterity. From the letter of Aurelian, we may justly infer, that
      Firmus was the last of the rebels, and consequently that Tetricus
      was already suppressed.]

      Since the foundation of Rome, no general had more nobly deserved
      a triumph than Aurelian; nor was a triumph ever celebrated with
      superior pride and magnificence. 77 The pomp was opened by twenty
      elephants, four royal tigers, and above two hundred of the most
      curious animals from every climate of the North, the East, and
      the South. They were followed by sixteen hundred gladiators,
      devoted to the cruel amusement of the amphitheatre. The wealth of
      Asia, the arms and ensigns of so many conquered nations, and the
      magnificent plate and wardrobe of the Syrian queen, were disposed
      in exact symmetry or artful disorder. The ambassadors of the most
      remote parts of the earth, of Æthiopia, Arabia, Persia,
      Bactriana, India, and China, all remarkable by their rich or
      singular dresses, displayed the fame and power of the Roman
      emperor, who exposed likewise to the public view the presents
      that he had received, and particularly a great number of crowns
      of gold, the offerings of grateful cities.

      The victories of Aurelian were attested by the long train of
      captives who reluctantly attended his triumph, Goths, Vandals,
      Sarmatians, Alemanni, Franks, Gauls, Syrians, and Egyptians. Each
      people was distinguished by its peculiar inscription, and the
      title of Amazons was bestowed on ten martial heroines of the
      Gothic nation who had been taken in arms. 78 But every eye,
      disregarding the crowd of captives, was fixed on the emperor
      Tetricus and the queen of the East. The former, as well as his
      son, whom he had created Augustus, was dressed in Gallic
      trousers, 79 a saffron tunic, and a robe of purple. The beauteous
      figure of Zenobia was confined by fetters of gold; a slave
      supported the gold chain which encircled her neck, and she almost
      fainted under the intolerable weight of jewels. She preceded on
      foot the magnificent chariot, in which she once hoped to enter
      the gates of Rome. It was followed by two other chariots, still
      more sumptuous, of Odenathus and of the Persian monarch. The
      triumphal car of Aurelian (it had formerly been used by a Gothic
      king) was drawn, on this memorable occasion, either by four stags
      or by four elephants. 80 The most illustrious of the senate, the
      people, and the army, closed the solemn procession. Unfeigned
      joy, wonder, and gratitude, swelled the acclamations of the
      multitude; but the satisfaction of the senate was clouded by the
      appearance of Tetricus; nor could they suppress a rising murmur,
      that the haughty emperor should thus expose to public ignominy
      the person of a Roman and a magistrate. 81

      But however, in the treatment of his unfortunate rivals, Aurelian
      might indulge his pride, he behaved towards them with a generous
      clemency, which was seldom exercised by the ancient conquerors.
      Princes who, without success, had defended their throne or
      freedom, were frequently strangled in prison, as soon as the
      triumphal pomp ascended the Capitol. These usurpers, whom their
      defeat had convicted of the crime of treason, were permitted to
      spend their lives in affluence and honorable repose.

      The emperor presented Zenobia with an elegant villa at Tibur, or
      Tivoli, about twenty miles from the capital; the Syrian queen
      insensibly sunk into a Roman matron, her daughters married into
      noble families, and her race was not yet extinct in the fifth
      century. 82 Tetricus and his son were reinstated in their rank
      and fortunes. They erected on the Cælian hill a magnificent
      palace, and as soon as it was finished, invited Aurelian to
      supper. On his entrance, he was agreeably surprised with a
      picture which represented their singular history. They were
      delineated offering to the emperor a civic crown and the sceptre
      of Gaul, and again receiving at his hands the ornaments of the
      senatorial dignity. The father was afterwards invested with the
      government of Lucania, 83 and Aurelian, who soon admitted the
      abdicated monarch to his friendship and conversation, familiarly
      asked him, Whether it were not more desirable to administer a
      province of Italy, than to reign beyond the Alps. The son long
      continued a respectable member of the senate; nor was there any
      one of the Roman nobility more esteemed by Aurelian, as well as
      by his successors. 84

      So long and so various was the pomp of Aurelian’s triumph, that
      although it opened with the dawn of day, the slow majesty of the
      procession ascended not the Capitol before the ninth hour; and it
      was already dark when the emperor returned to the palace. The
      festival was protracted by theatrical representations, the games
      of the circus, the hunting of wild beasts, combats of gladiators,
      and naval engagements. Liberal donatives were distributed to the
      army and people, and several institutions, agreeable or
      beneficial to the city, contributed to perpetuate the glory of
      Aurelian. A considerable portion of his oriental spoils was
      consecrated to the gods of Rome; the Capitol, and every other
      temple, glittered with the offerings of his ostentatious piety;
      and the temple of the Sun alone received above fifteen thousand
      pounds of gold. 85 This last was a magnificent structure, erected
      by the emperor on the side of the Quirinal hill, and dedicated,
      soon after the triumph, to that deity whom Aurelian adored as the
      parent of his life and fortunes. His mother had been an inferior
      priestess in a chapel of the Sun; a peculiar devotion to the god
      of Light was a sentiment which the fortunate peasant imbibed in
      his infancy; and every step of his elevation, every victory of
      his reign, fortified superstition by gratitude. 86

      The arms of Aurelian had vanquished the foreign and domestic foes
      of the republic. We are assured, that, by his salutary rigor,
      crimes and factions, mischievous arts and pernicious connivance,
      the luxurious growth of a feeble and oppressive government, were
      eradicated throughout the Roman world. 87 But if we attentively
      reflect how much swifter is the progress of corruption than its
      cure, and if we remember that the years abandoned to public
      disorders exceeded the months allotted to the martial reign of
      Aurelian, we must confess that a few short intervals of peace
      were insufficient for the arduous work of reformation. Even his
      attempt to restore the integrity of the coin was opposed by a
      formidable insurrection. The emperor’s vexation breaks out in one
      of his private letters. “Surely,” says he, “the gods have decreed
      that my life should be a perpetual warfare. A sedition within the
      walls has just now given birth to a very serious civil war. The
      workmen of the mint, at the instigation of Felicissimus, a slave
      to whom I had intrusted an employment in the finances, have risen
      in rebellion. They are at length suppressed; but seven thousand
      of my soldiers have been slain in the contest, of those troops
      whose ordinary station is in Dacia, and the camps along the
      Danube.” 88 Other writers, who confirm the same fact, add
      likewise, that it happened soon after Aurelian’s triumph; that
      the decisive engagement was fought on the Cælian hill; that the
      workmen of the mint had adulterated the coin; and that the
      emperor restored the public credit, by delivering out good money
      in exchange for the bad, which the people was commanded to bring
      into the treasury. 89

      87 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 221.]

      We might content ourselves with relating this extraordinary
      transaction, but we cannot dissemble how much in its present form
      it appears to us inconsistent and incredible. The debasement of
      the coin is indeed well suited to the administration of
      Gallienus; nor is it unlikely that the instruments of the
      corruption might dread the inflexible justice of Aurelian. But
      the guilt, as well as the profit, must have been confined to a
      very few; nor is it easy to conceive by what arts they could arm
      a people whom they had injured, against a monarch whom they had
      betrayed. We might naturally expect that such miscreants should
      have shared the public detestation with the informers and the
      other ministers of oppression; and that the reformation of the
      coin should have been an action equally popular with the
      destruction of those obsolete accounts, which by the emperor’s
      order were burnt in the forum of Trajan. 90 In an age when the
      principles of commerce were so imperfectly understood, the most
      desirable end might perhaps be effected by harsh and injudicious
      means; but a temporary grievance of such a nature can scarcely
      excite and support a serious civil war. The repetition of
      intolerable taxes, imposed either on the land or on the
      necessaries of life, may at last provoke those who will not, or
      who cannot, relinquish their country. But the case is far
      otherwise in every operation which, by whatsoever expedients,
      restores the just value of money. The transient evil is soon
      obliterated by the permanent benefit, the loss is divided among
      multitudes; and if a few wealthy individuals experience a
      sensible diminution of treasure, with their riches, they at the
      same time lose the degree of weight and importance which they
      derived from the possession of them. However Aurelian might
      choose to disguise the real cause of the insurrection, his
      reformation of the coin could furnish only a faint pretence to a
      party already powerful and discontented. Rome, though deprived of
      freedom, was distracted by faction. The people, towards whom the
      emperor, himself a plebeian, always expressed a peculiar
      fondness, lived in perpetual dissension with the senate, the
      equestrian order, and the Prætorian guards. 91 Nothing less than
      the firm though secret conspiracy of those orders, of the
      authority of the first, the wealth of the second, and the arms of
      the third, could have displayed a strength capable of contending
      in battle with the veteran legions of the Danube, which, under
      the conduct of a martial sovereign, had achieved the conquest of
      the West and of the East.

      Whatever was the cause or the object of this rebellion, imputed
      with so little probability to the workmen of the mint, Aurelian
      used his victory with unrelenting rigor. 92 He was naturally of a
      severe disposition. A peasant and a soldier, his nerves yielded
      not easily to the impressions of sympathy, and he could sustain
      without emotion the sight of tortures and death. Trained from his
      earliest youth in the exercise of arms, he set too small a value
      on the life of a citizen, chastised by military execution the
      slightest offences, and transferred the stern discipline of the
      camp into the civil administration of the laws. His love of
      justice often became a blind and furious passion; and whenever he
      deemed his own or the public safety endangered, he disregarded
      the rules of evidence, and the proportion of punishments. The
      unprovoked rebellion with which the Romans rewarded his services,
      exasperated his haughty spirit. The noblest families of the
      capital were involved in the guilt or suspicion of this dark
      conspiracy. A nasty spirit of revenge urged the bloody
      prosecution, and it proved fatal to one of the nephews of the
      emperor. The executioners (if we may use the expression of a
      contemporary poet) were fatigued, the prisons were crowded, and
      the unhappy senate lamented the death or absence of its most
      illustrious members. 93 Nor was the pride of Aurelian less
      offensive to that assembly than his cruelty. Ignorant or
      impatient of the restraints of civil institutions, he disdained
      to hold his power by any other title than that of the sword, and
      governed by right of conquest an empire which he had saved and
      subdued. 94

      It was observed by one of the most sagacious of the Roman
      princes, that the talents of his predecessor Aurelian were better
      suited to the command of an army, than to the government of an
      empire. 95 Conscious of the character in which nature and
      experience had enabled him to excel, he again took the field a
      few months after his triumph. It was expedient to exercise the
      restless temper of the legions in some foreign war, and the
      Persian monarch, exulting in the shame of Valerian, still braved
      with impunity the offended majesty of Rome. At the head of an
      army, less formidable by its numbers than by its discipline and
      valor, the emperor advanced as far as the Straits which divide
      Europe from Asia. He there experienced that the most absolute
      power is a weak defence against the effects of despair. He had
      threatened one of his secretaries who was accused of extortion;
      and it was known that he seldom threatened in vain. The last hope
      which remained for the criminal was to involve some of the
      principal officers of the army in his danger, or at least in his
      fears. Artfully counterfeiting his master’s hand, he showed them,
      in a long and bloody list, their own names devoted to death.
      Without suspecting or examining the fraud, they resolved to
      secure their lives by the murder of the emperor. On his march,
      between Byzantium and Heraclea, Aurelian was suddenly attacked by
      the conspirators, whose stations gave them a right to surround
      his person, and after a short resistance, fell by the hand of
      Mucapor, a general whom he had always loved and trusted. He died
      regretted by the army, detested by the senate, but universally
      acknowledged as a warlike and fortunate prince, the useful,
      though severe reformer of a degenerate state. 96
