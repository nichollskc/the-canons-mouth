Chapter LXI: Partition Of The Empire By The French And
      Venetians.—Part I.

     Partition Of The Empire By The French And Venetians,—Five Latin
     Emperors Of The Houses Of Flanders And Courtenay.— Their Wars
     Against The Bulgarians And Greeks.—Weakness And Poverty Of The
     Latin Empire.—Recovery Of Constantinople By The Greeks.—General
     Consequences Of The Crusades.

      After the death of the lawful princes, the French and Venetians,
      confident of justice and victory, agreed to divide and regulate
      their future possessions. 1 It was stipulated by treaty, that
      twelve electors, six of either nation, should be nominated; that
      a majority should choose the emperor of the East; and that, if
      the votes were equal, the decision of chance should ascertain the
      successful candidate. To him, with all the titles and
      prerogatives of the Byzantine throne, they assigned the two
      palaces of Boucoleon and Blachernæ, with a fourth part of the
      Greek monarchy. It was defined that the three remaining portions
      should be equally shared between the republic of Venice and the
      barons of France; that each feudatory, with an honorable
      exception for the doge, should acknowledge and perform the duties
      of homage and military service to the supreme head of the empire;
      that the nation which gave an emperor, should resign to their
      brethren the choice of a patriarch; and that the pilgrims,
      whatever might be their impatience to visit the Holy Land, should
      devote another year to the conquest and defence of the Greek
      provinces. After the conquest of Constantinople by the Latins,
      the treaty was confirmed and executed; and the first and most
      important step was the creation of an emperor. The six electors
      of the French nation were all ecclesiastics, the abbot of Loces,
      the archbishop elect of Acre in Palestine, and the bishops of
      Troyes, Soissons, Halberstadt, and Bethlehem, the last of whom
      exercised in the camp the office of pope’s legate: their
      profession and knowledge were respectable; and as _they_ could
      not be the objects, they were best qualified to be the authors of
      the choice. The six Venetians were the principal servants of the
      state, and in this list the noble families of Querini and
      Contarini are still proud to discover their ancestors. The twelve
      assembled in the chapel of the palace; and after the solemn
      invocation of the Holy Ghost, they proceeded to deliberate and
      vote. A just impulse of respect and gratitude prompted them to
      crown the virtues of the doge; his wisdom had inspired their
      enterprise; and the most youthful knights might envy and applaud
      the exploits of blindness and age. But the patriot Dandolo was
      devoid of all personal ambition, and fully satisfied that he had
      been judged worthy to reign. His nomination was overruled by the
      Venetians themselves: his countrymen, and perhaps his friends, 2
      represented, with the eloquence of truth, the mischiefs that
      might arise to national freedom and the common cause, from the
      union of two incompatible characters, of the first magistrate of
      a republic and the emperor of the East. The exclusion of the doge
      left room for the more equal merits of Boniface and Baldwin; and
      at their names all meaner candidates respectfully withdrew. The
      marquis of Montferrat was recommended by his mature age and fair
      reputation, by the choice of the adventurers, and the wishes of
      the Greeks; nor can I believe that Venice, the mistress of the
      sea, could be seriously apprehensive of a petty lord at the foot
      of the Alps. 3 But the count of Flanders was the chief of a
      wealthy and warlike people: he was valiant, pious, and chaste; in
      the prime of life, since he was only thirty-two years of age; a
      descendant of Charlemagne, a cousin of the king of France, and a
      compeer of the prelates and barons who had yielded with
      reluctance to the command of a foreigner. Without the chapel,
      these barons, with the doge and marquis at their head, expected
      the decision of the twelve electors. It was announced by the
      bishop of Soissons, in the name of his colleagues: “Ye have sworn
      to obey the prince whom we should choose: by our unanimous
      suffrage, Baldwin count of Flanders and Hainault is now your
      sovereign, and the emperor of the East.” He was saluted with loud
      applause, and the proclamation was reechoed through the city by
      the joy of the Latins, and the trembling adulation of the Greeks.
      Boniface was the first to kiss the hand of his rival, and to
      raise him on the buckler: and Baldwin was transported to the
      cathedral, and solemnly invested with the purple buskins. At the
      end of three weeks he was crowned by the legate, in the vacancy
      of the patriarch; but the Venetian clergy soon filled the chapter
      of St. Sophia, seated Thomas Morosini on the ecclesiastical
      throne, and employed every art to perpetuate in their own nation
      the honors and benefices of the Greek church. 4 Without delay the
      successor of Constantine instructed Palestine, France, and Rome,
      of this memorable revolution. To Palestine he sent, as a trophy,
      the gates of Constantinople, and the chain of the harbor; 5 and
      adopted, from the Assise of Jerusalem, the laws or customs best
      adapted to a French colony and conquest in the East. In his
      epistles, the natives of France are encouraged to swell that
      colony, and to secure that conquest, to people a magnificent city
      and a fertile land, which will reward the labors both of the
      priest and the soldier. He congratulates the Roman pontiff on the
      restoration of his authority in the East; invites him to
      extinguish the Greek schism by his presence in a general council;
      and implores his blessing and forgiveness for the disobedient
      pilgrims. Prudence and dignity are blended in the answer of
      Innocent. 6 In the subversion of the Byzantine empire, he
      arraigns the vices of man, and adores the providence of God; the
      conquerors will be absolved or condemned by their future conduct;
      the validity of their treaty depends on the judgment of St.
      Peter; but he inculcates their most sacred duty of establishing a
      just subordination of obedience and tribute, from the Greeks to
      the Latins, from the magistrate to the clergy, and from the
      clergy to the pope.

      last were Venetians.]

      the ecclesiastical and civil institution of the Latin empire of
      Constantinople; and the most important of these epistles (of
      which the collection in 2 vols. in folio is published by Stephen
      Baluze) are inserted in his Gesta, in Muratori, Script. Rerum
      Italicarum, tom. iii. p. l. c. 94—105.]

      In the division of the Greek provinces, 7 the share of the
      Venetians was more ample than that of the Latin emperor. No more
      than one fourth was appropriated to his domain; a clear moiety of
      the remainder was reserved for Venice; and the other moiety was
      distributed among the adventurers of France and Lombardy. The
      venerable Dandolo was proclaimed despot of Romania, and invested
      after the Greek fashion with the purple buskins. He ended at
      Constantinople his long and glorious life; and if the prerogative
      was personal, the title was used by his successors till the
      middle of the fourteenth century, with the singular, though true,
      addition of lords of one fourth and a half of the Roman empire. 8
      The doge, a slave of state, was seldom permitted to depart from
      the helm of the republic; but his place was supplied by the
      _bail_, or regent, who exercised a supreme jurisdiction over the
      colony of Venetians: they possessed three of the eight quarters
      of the city; and his independent tribunal was composed of six
      judges, four counsellors, two chamberlains two fiscal advocates,
      and a constable. Their long experience of the Eastern trade
      enabled them to select their portion with discernment: they had
      rashly accepted the dominion and defence of Adrianople; but it
      was the more reasonable aim of their policy to form a chain of
      factories, and cities, and islands, along the maritime coast,
      from the neighborhood of Ragusa to the Hellespont and the
      Bosphorus. The labor and cost of such extensive conquests
      exhausted their treasury: they abandoned their maxims of
      government, adopted a feudal system, and contented themselves
      with the homage of their nobles, 9 for the possessions which
      these private vassals undertook to reduce and maintain. And thus
      it was that the family of Sanut acquired the duchy of Naxos,
      which involved the greatest part of the archipelago. For the
      price of ten thousand marks, the republic purchased of the
      marquis of Montferrat the fertile Island of Crete or Candia, with
      the ruins of a hundred cities; 10 but its improvement was stinted
      by the proud and narrow spirit of an aristocracy; 11 and the
      wisest senators would confess that the sea, not the land, was the
      treasury of St. Mark. In the moiety of the adventurers the
      marquis Boniface might claim the most liberal reward; and,
      besides the Isle of Crete, his exclusion from the throne was
      compensated by the royal title and the provinces beyond the
      Hellespont. But he prudently exchanged that distant and difficult
      conquest for the kingdom of Thessalonica Macedonia, twelve days’
      journey from the capital, where he might be supported by the
      neighboring powers of his brother-in-law the king of Hungary. His
      progress was hailed by the voluntary or reluctant acclamations of
      the natives; and Greece, the proper and ancient Greece, again
      received a Latin conqueror, 12 who trod with indifference that
      classic ground. He viewed with a careless eye the beauties of the
      valley of Tempe; traversed with a cautious step the straits of
      Thermopylæ; occupied the unknown cities of Thebes, Athens, and
      Argos; and assaulted the fortifications of Corinth and Napoli, 13
      which resisted his arms. The lots of the Latin pilgrims were
      regulated by chance, or choice, or subsequent exchange; and they
      abused, with intemperate joy, their triumph over the lives and
      fortunes of a great people. After a minute survey of the
      provinces, they weighed in the scales of avarice the revenue of
      each district, the advantage of the situation, and the ample or
      scanty supplies for the maintenance of soldiers and horses. Their
      presumption claimed and divided the long-lost dependencies of the
      Roman sceptre: the Nile and Euphrates rolled through their
      imaginary realms; and happy was the warrior who drew for his
      prize the palace of the Turkish sultan of Iconium. 14 I shall not
      descend to the pedigree of families and the rent-roll of estates,
      but I wish to specify that the counts of Blois and St. Pol were
      invested with the duchy of Nice and the lordship of Demotica: 15
      the principal fiefs were held by the service of constable,
      chamberlain, cup-bearer, butler, and chief cook; and our
      historian, Jeffrey of Villehardouin, obtained a fair
      establishment on the banks of the Hebrus, and united the double
      office of marshal of Champagne and Romania. At the head of his
      knights and archers, each baron mounted on horseback to secure
      the possession of his share, and their first efforts were
      generally successful. But the public force was weakened by their
      dispersion; and a thousand quarrels must arise under a law, and
      among men, whose sole umpire was the sword. Within three months
      after the conquest of Constantinople, the emperor and the king of
      Thessalonica drew their hostile followers into the field; they
      were reconciled by the authority of the doge, the advice of the
      marshal, and the firm freedom of their peers. 16

      7 (return) [ In the treaty of partition, most of the names are
      corrupted by the scribes: they might be restored, and a good map,

      modern appellation of Demotica. This place was the last Turkish

      16 (return) [ Their quarrel is told by Villehardouin (No.
      146—158) with the spirit of freedom. The merit and reputation of
      the marshal are so acknowledged by the Greek historian (p. 387)

      modern heroes, whose exploits are only visible in their own
      memoirs. * Note: William de Champlite, brother of the count of
      Dijon, assumed the title of Prince of Achaia: on the death of his
      brother, he returned, with regret, to France, to assume his
      paternal inheritance, and left Villehardouin his “_bailli_,” on
      condition that if he did not return within a year Villehardouin
      was to retain an investiture. Brosset’s Add. to Le Beau, vol.
      xvii. p. 200. M. Brosset adds, from the Greek chronicler edited
      by M. Buchon, the somewhat unknightly trick by which
      Villehardouin disembarrassed himself from the troublesome claim
      of Robert, the cousin of the count of Dijon. to the succession.
      He contrived that Robert should arrive just fifteen days too
      late; and with the general concurrence of the assembled knights
      was himself invested with the principality. Ibid. p. 283. M.]

      Two fugitives, who had reigned at Constantinople, still asserted
      the title of emperor; and the subjects of their fallen throne
      might be moved to pity by the misfortunes of the elder Alexius,
      or excited to revenge by the spirit of Mourzoufle. A domestic
      alliance, a common interest, a similar guilt, and the merit of
      extinguishing his enemies, a brother and a nephew, induced the
      more recent usurper to unite with the former the relics of his
      power. Mourzoufle was received with smiles and honors in the camp
      of his father Alexius; but the wicked can never love, and should
      rarely trust, their fellow-criminals; he was seized in the bath,
      deprived of his eyes, stripped of his troops and treasures, and
      turned out to wander an object of horror and contempt to those
      who with more propriety could hate, and with more justice could
      punish, the assassin of the emperor Isaac and his son. As the
      tyrant, pursued by fear or remorse, was stealing over to Asia, he
      was seized by the Latins of Constantinople, and condemned, after
      an open trial, to an ignominious death. His judges debated the
      mode of his execution, the axe, the wheel, or the stake; and it
      was resolved that Mourzoufle 17 should ascend the Theodosian
      column, a pillar of white marble of one hundred and forty-seven
      feet in height. 18 From the summit he was cast down headlong, and
      dashed in pieces on the pavement, in the presence of innumerable
      spectators, who filled the forum of Taurus, and admired the
      accomplishment of an old prediction, which was explained by this
      singular event. 19 The fate of Alexius is less tragical: he was
      sent by the marquis a captive to Italy, and a gift to the king of
      the Romans; but he had not much to applaud his fortune, if the
      sentence of imprisonment and exile were changed from a fortress
      in the Alps to a monastery in Asia. But his daughter, before the
      national calamity, had been given in marriage to a young hero who
      continued the succession, and restored the throne, of the Greek
      princes. 20 The valor of Theodore Lascaris was signalized in the
      two sieges of Constantinople. After the flight of Mourzoufle,
      when the Latins were already in the city, he offered himself as
      their emperor to the soldiers and people; and his ambition, which
      might be virtuous, was undoubtedly brave. Could he have infused a
      soul into the multitude, they might have crushed the strangers
      under their feet: their abject despair refused his aid; and
      Theodore retired to breathe the air of freedom in Anatolia,
      beyond the immediate view and pursuit of the conquerors. Under
      the title, at first of despot, and afterwards of emperor, he drew
      to his standard the bolder spirits, who were fortified against
      slavery by the contempt of life; and as every means was lawful
      for the public safety implored without scruple the alliance of
      the Turkish sultan Nice, where Theodore established his
      residence, Prusa and Philadelphia, Smyrna and Ephesus, opened
      their gates to their deliverer: he derived strength and
      reputation from his victories, and even from his defeats; and the
      successor of Constantine preserved a fragment of the empire from
      the banks of the Mæander to the suburbs of Nicomedia, and at
      length of Constantinople. Another portion, distant and obscure,
      was possessed by the lineal heir of the Comneni, a son of the
      virtuous Manuel, a grandson of the tyrant Andronicus. His name
      was Alexius; and the epithet of great 201 was applied perhaps to
      his stature, rather than to his exploits. By the indulgence of
      the Angeli, he was appointed governor or duke of Trebizond: 21
      211 his birth gave him ambition, the revolution independence;
      and, without changing his title, he reigned in peace from Sinope
      to the Phasis, along the coast of the Black Sea. His nameless son
      and successor 212 is described as the vassal of the sultan, whom
      he served with two hundred lances: that Comnenian prince was no
      more than duke of Trebizond, and the title of emperor was first
      assumed by the pride and envy of the grandson of Alexius. In the
      West, a third fragment was saved from the common shipwreck by
      Michael, a bastard of the house of Angeli, who, before the
      revolution, had been known as a hostage, a soldier, and a rebel.
      His flight from the camp of the marquis Boniface secured his
      freedom; by his marriage with the governor’s daughter, he
      commanded the important place of Durazzo, assumed the title of
      despot, and founded a strong and conspicuous principality in
      Epirus, Ætolia, and Thessaly, which have ever been peopled by a
      warlike race. The Greeks, who had offered their service to their
      new sovereigns, were excluded by the haughty Latins 22 from all
      civil and military honors, as a nation born to tremble and obey.
      Their resentment prompted them to show that they might have been
      useful friends, since they could be dangerous enemies: their
      nerves were braced by adversity: whatever was learned or holy,
      whatever was noble or valiant, rolled away into the independent
      states of Trebizond, Epirus, and Nice; and a single patrician is
      marked by the ambiguous praise of attachment and loyalty to the
      Franks. The vulgar herd of the cities and the country would have
      gladly submitted to a mild and regular servitude; and the
      transient disorders of war would have been obliterated by some
      years of industry and peace. But peace was banished, and industry
      was crushed, in the disorders of the feudal system. The _Roman_
      emperors of Constantinople, if they were endowed with abilities,
      were armed with power for the protection of their subjects: their
      laws were wise, and their administration was simple. The Latin
      throne was filled by a titular prince, the chief, and often the
      servant, of his licentious confederates; the fiefs of the empire,
      from a kingdom to a castle, were held and ruled by the sword of
      the barons; and their discord, poverty, and ignorance, extended
      the ramifications of tyranny to the most sequestered villages.
      The Greeks were oppressed by the double weight of the priests,
      who were invested with temporal power, and of the soldier, who
      was inflamed by fanatic hatred; and the insuperable bar of
      religion and language forever separated the stranger and the
      native. As long as the crusaders were united at Constantinople,
      the memory of their conquest, and the terror of their arms,
      imposed silence on the captive land: their dispersion betrayed
      the smallness of their numbers and the defects of their
      discipline; and some failures and mischances revealed the secret,
      that they were not invincible. As the fears of the Greeks abated,
      their hatred increased. They murdered; they conspired; and before
      a year of slavery had elapsed, they implored, or accepted, the
      succor of a Barbarian, whose power they had felt, and whose
      gratitude they trusted. 23

      praise of an original and classic work.]

      The Latin conquerors had been saluted with a solemn and early
      embassy from John, or Joannice, or Calo-John, the revolted chief
      of the Bulgarians and Walachians. He deemed himself their
      brother, as the votary of the Roman pontiff, from whom he had
      received the regal title and a holy banner; and in the subversion
      of the Greek monarchy, he might aspire to the name of their
      friend and accomplice. But Calo-John was astonished to find, that
      the Count of Flanders had assumed the pomp and pride of the
      successors of Constantine; and his ambassadors were dismissed
      with a haughty message, that the rebel must deserve a pardon, by
      touching with his forehead the footstool of the Imperial throne.
      His resentment 24 would have exhaled in acts of violence and
      blood: his cooler policy watched the rising discontent of the
      Greeks; affected a tender concern for their sufferings; and
      promised, that their first struggles for freedom should be
      supported by his person and kingdom. The conspiracy was
      propagated by national hatred, the firmest band of association
      and secrecy: the Greeks were impatient to sheathe their daggers
      in the breasts of the victorious strangers; but the execution was
      prudently delayed, till Henry, the emperor’s brother, had
      transported the flower of his troops beyond the Hellespont. Most
      of the towns and villages of Thrace were true to the moment and
      the signal; and the Latins, without arms or suspicion, were
      slaughtered by the vile and merciless revenge of their slaves.
      From Demotica, the first scene of the massacre, the surviving
      vassals of the count of St. Pol escaped to Adrianople; but the
      French and Venetians, who occupied that city, were slain or
      expelled by the furious multitude: the garrisons that could
      effect their retreat fell back on each other towards the
      metropolis; and the fortresses, that separately stood against the
      rebels, were ignorant of each other’s and of their sovereign’s
      fate. The voice of fame and fear announced the revolt of the
      Greeks and the rapid approach of their Bulgarian ally; and
      Calo-John, not depending on the forces of his own kingdom, had
      drawn from the Scythian wilderness a body of fourteen thousand
      Comans, who drank, as it was said, the blood of their captives,
      and sacrificed the Christians on the altars of their gods. 25

      24 (return) [ In Calo-John’s answer to the pope we may find his
      claims and complaints, (Gesta Innocent III. c. 108, 109:) he was
      cherished at Rome as the prodigal son.]

      25 (return) [ The Comans were a Tartar or Turkman horde, which
      encamped in the xiith and xiiith centuries on the verge of
      Moldavia. The greater part were pagans, but some were Mahometans,
      and the whole horde was converted to Christianity (A.D. 1370) by
      Lewis, king of Hungary.]

      Alarmed by this sudden and growing danger, the emperor despatched
      a swift messenger to recall Count Henry and his troops; and had
      Baldwin expected the return of his gallant brother, with a supply
      of twenty thousand Armenians, he might have encountered the
      invader with equal numbers and a decisive superiority of arms and
      discipline. But the spirit of chivalry could seldom discriminate
      caution from cowardice; and the emperor took the field with a
      hundred and forty knights, and their train of archers and
      sergeants. The marshal, who dissuaded and obeyed, led the
      vanguard in their march to Adrianople; the main body was
      commanded by the count of Blois; the aged doge of Venice followed
      with the rear; and their scanty numbers were increased from all
      sides by the fugitive Latins. They undertook to besiege the
      rebels of Adrianople; and such was the pious tendency of the
      crusades that they employed the holy week in pillaging the
      country for their subsistence, and in framing engines for the
      destruction of their fellow-Christians. But the Latins were soon
      interrupted and alarmed by the light cavalry of the Comans, who
      boldly skirmished to the edge of their imperfect lines: and a
      proclamation was issued by the marshal of Romania, that, on the
      trumpet’s sound, the cavalry should mount and form; but that
      none, under pain of death, should abandon themselves to a
      desultory and dangerous pursuit. This wise injunction was first
      disobeyed by the count of Blois, who involved the emperor in his
      rashness and ruin. The Comans, of the Parthian or Tartar school,
      fled before their first charge; but after a career of two
      leagues, when the knights and their horses were almost
      breathless, they suddenly turned, rallied, and encompassed the
      heavy squadrons of the Franks. The count was slain on the field;
      the emperor was made prisoner; and if the one disdained to fly,
      if the other refused to yield, their personal bravery made a poor
      atonement for their ignorance, or neglect, of the duties of a
      general. 26

      suffered by the _Romans_,” i. e. the Byzantines. It is an
      effusion of malicious triumph against the Venetians, to whom he
      always ascribes the capture of Constantinople.—M.]




      Chapter LXI: Partition Of The Empire By The French And
      Venetians.—Part II.

      Proud of his victory and his royal prize, the Bulgarian advanced
      to relieve Adrianople and achieve the destruction of the Latins.
      They must inevitably have been destroyed, if the marshal of
      Romania had not displayed a cool courage and consummate skill;
      uncommon in all ages, but most uncommon in those times, when war
      was a passion, rather than a science. His grief and fears were
      poured into the firm and faithful bosom of the doge; but in the
      camp he diffused an assurance of safety, which could only be
      realized by the general belief. All day he maintained his
      perilous station between the city and the Barbarians:
      Villehardouin decamped in silence at the dead of night; and his
      masterly retreat of three days would have deserved the praise of
      Xenophon and the ten thousand. In the rear, the marshal supported
      the weight of the pursuit; in the front, he moderated the
      impatience of the fugitives; and wherever the Comans approached,
      they were repelled by a line of impenetrable spears. On the third
      day, the weary troops beheld the sea, the solitary town of
      Rodosta, 27 and their friends, who had landed from the Asiatic
      shore. They embraced, they wept; but they united their arms and
      counsels; and in his brother’s absence, Count Henry assumed the
      regency of the empire, at once in a state of childhood and
      caducity. 28 If the Comans withdrew from the summer heats, seven
      thousand Latins, in the hour of danger, deserted Constantinople,
      their brethren, and their vows. Some partial success was
      overbalanced by the loss of one hundred and twenty knights in the
      field of Rusium; and of the Imperial domain, no more was left
      than the capital, with two or three adjacent fortresses on the
      shores of Europe and Asia. The king of Bulgaria was resistless
      and inexorable; and Calo-John respectfully eluded the demands of
      the pope, who conjured his new proselyte to restore peace and the
      emperor to the afflicted Latins. The deliverance of Baldwin was
      no longer, he said, in the power of man: that prince had died in
      prison; and the manner of his death is variously related by
      ignorance and credulity. The lovers of a tragic legend will be
      pleased to hear, that the royal captive was tempted by the
      amorous queen of the Bulgarians; that his chaste refusal exposed
      him to the falsehood of a woman and the jealousy of a savage;
      that his hands and feet were severed from his body; that his
      bleeding trunk was cast among the carcasses of dogs and horses;
      and that he breathed three days, before he was devoured by the
      birds of prey. 29 About twenty years afterwards, in a wood of the
      Netherlands, a hermit announced himself as the true Baldwin, the
      emperor of Constantinople, and lawful sovereign of Flanders. He
      related the wonders of his escape, his adventures, and his
      penance, among a people prone to believe and to rebel; and, in
      the first transport, Flanders acknowledged her long-lost
      sovereign. A short examination before the French court detected
      the impostor, who was punished with an ignominious death; but the
      Flemings still adhered to the pleasing error; and the countess
      Jane is accused by the gravest historians of sacrificing to her
      ambition the life of an unfortunate father. 30

      teneretur, (Gesta Innocent III. c. 109.) * Note: Compare Von
      Raumer. Geschichte der Hohenstaufen, vol. ii. p. 237. Petitot, in
      his preface to Villehardouin in the Collection des Mémoires,
      relatifs a l’Histoire de France, tom. i. p. 85, expresses his
      belief in the first part of the “tragic legend.”—M.]

      30 (return) [ See the story of this impostor from the French and
      Flemish writers in Ducange, Hist. de C. P. iii. 9; and the
      ridiculous fables that were believed by the monks of St. Alban’s,

      In all civilized hostility, a treaty is established for the
      exchange or ransom of prisoners; and if their captivity be
      prolonged, their condition is known, and they are treated
      according to their rank with humanity or honor. But the savage
      Bulgarian was a stranger to the laws of war: his prisons were
      involved in darkness and silence; and above a year elapsed before
      the Latins could be assured of the death of Baldwin, before his
      brother, the regent Henry, would consent to assume the title of
      emperor. His moderation was applauded by the Greeks as an act of
      rare and inimitable virtue. Their light and perfidious ambition
      was eager to seize or anticipate the moment of a vacancy, while a
      law of succession, the guardian both of the prince and people,
      was gradually defined and confirmed in the hereditary monarchies
      of Europe. In the support of the Eastern empire, Henry was
      gradually left without an associate, as the heroes of the crusade
      retired from the world or from the war. The doge of Venice, the
      venerable Dandolo, in the fulness of years and glory, sunk into
      the grave. The marquis of Montferrat was slowly recalled from the
      Peloponnesian war to the revenge of Baldwin and the defence of
      Thessalonica. Some nice disputes of feudal homage and service
      were reconciled in a personal interview between the emperor and
      the king; they were firmly united by mutual esteem and the common
      danger; and their alliance was sealed by the nuptials of Henry
      with the daughter of the Italian prince. He soon deplored the
      loss of his friend and father. At the persuasion of some faithful
      Greeks, Boniface made a bold and successful inroad among the
      hills of Rhodope: the Bulgarians fled on his approach; they
      assembled to harass his retreat. On the intelligence that his
      rear was attacked, without waiting for any defensive armor, he
      leaped on horseback, couched his lance, and drove the enemies
      before him; but in the rash pursuit he was pierced with a mortal
      wound; and the head of the king of Thessalonica was presented to
      Calo-John, who enjoyed the honors, without the merit, of victory.
      It is here, at this melancholy event, that the pen or the voice
      of Jeffrey of Villehardouin seems to drop or to expire; 31 and if
      he still exercised his military office of marshal of Romania, his
      subsequent exploits are buried in oblivion. 32 The character of
      Henry was not unequal to his arduous situation: in the siege of
      Constantinople, and beyond the Hellespont, he had deserved the
      fame of a valiant knight and a skilful commander; and his courage
      was tempered with a degree of prudence and mildness unknown to
      his impetuous brother. In the double war against the Greeks of
      Asia and the Bulgarians of Europe, he was ever the foremost on
      shipboard or on horseback; and though he cautiously provided for
      the success of his arms, the drooping Latins were often roused by
      his example to save and to second their fearless emperor. But
      such efforts, and some supplies of men and money from France,
      were of less avail than the errors, the cruelty, and death, of
      their most formidable adversary. When the despair of the Greek
      subjects invited Calo-John as their deliverer, they hoped that he
      would protect their liberty and adopt their laws: they were soon
      taught to compare the degrees of national ferocity, and to
      execrate the savage conqueror, who no longer dissembled his
      intention of dispeopling Thrace, of demolishing the cities, and
      of transplanting the inhabitants beyond the Danube. Many towns
      and villages of Thrace were already evacuated: a heap of ruins
      marked the place of Philippopolis, and a similar calamity was
      expected at Demotica and Adrianople, by the first authors of the
      revolt. They raised a cry of grief and repentance to the throne
      of Henry; the emperor alone had the magnanimity to forgive and
      trust them. No more than four hundred knights, with their
      sergeants and archers, could be assembled under his banner; and
      with this slender force he fought 321 and repulsed the Bulgarian,
      who, besides his infantry, was at the head of forty thousand
      horse. In this expedition, Henry felt the difference between a
      hostile and a friendly country: the remaining cities were
      preserved by his arms; and the savage, with shame and loss, was
      compelled to relinquish his prey. The siege of Thessalonica was
      the last of the evils which Calo-John inflicted or suffered: he
      was stabbed in the night in his tent; and the general, perhaps
      the assassin, who found him weltering in his blood, ascribed the
      blow, with general applause, to the lance of St. Demetrius. 33
      After several victories, the prudence of Henry concluded an
      honorable peace with the successor of the tyrant, and with the
      Greek princes of Nice and Epirus. If he ceded some doubtful
      limits, an ample kingdom was reserved for himself and his
      feudatories; and his reign, which lasted only ten years, afforded
      a short interval of prosperity and peace. Far above the narrow
      policy of Baldwin and Boniface, he freely intrusted to the Greeks
      the most important offices of the state and army; and this
      liberality of sentiment and practice was the more seasonable, as
      the princes of Nice and Epirus had already learned to seduce and
      employ the mercenary valor of the Latins. It was the aim of Henry
      to unite and reward his deserving subjects, of every nation and
      language; but he appeared less solicitous to accomplish the
      impracticable union of the two churches. Pelagius, the pope’s
      legate, who acted as the sovereign of Constantinople, had
      interdicted the worship of the Greeks, and sternly imposed the
      payment of tithes, the double procession of the Holy Ghost, and a
      blind obedience to the Roman pontiff. As the weaker party, they
      pleaded the duties of conscience, and implored the rights of
      toleration: “Our bodies,” they said, “are Cæsar’s, but our souls
      belong only to God.” The persecution was checked by the firmness
      of the emperor: 34 and if we can believe that the same prince was
      poisoned by the Greeks themselves, we must entertain a
      contemptible idea of the sense and gratitude of mankind. His
      valor was a vulgar attribute, which he shared with ten thousand
      knights; but Henry possessed the superior courage to oppose, in a
      superstitious age, the pride and avarice of the clergy. In the
      cathedral of St. Sophia he presumed to place his throne on the
      right hand of the patriarch; and this presumption excited the
      sharpest censure of Pope Innocent the Third. By a salutary edict,
      one of the first examples of the laws of mortmain, he prohibited
      the alienation of fiefs: many of the Latins, desirous of
      returning to Europe, resigned their estates to the church for a
      spiritual or temporal reward; these holy lands were immediately
      discharged from military service, and a colony of soldiers would
      have been gradually transformed into a college of priests. 35

      the emperor.]

      The virtuous Henry died at Thessalonica, in the defence of that
      kingdom, and of an infant, the son of his friend Boniface. In the
      two first emperors of Constantinople the male line of the counts
      of Flanders was extinct. But their sister Yolande was the wife of
      a French prince, the mother of a numerous progeny; and one of her
      daughters had married Andrew king of Hungary, a brave and pious
      champion of the cross. By seating him on the Byzantine throne,
      the barons of Romania would have acquired the forces of a
      neighboring and warlike kingdom; but the prudent Andrew revered
      the laws of succession; and the princess Yolande, with her
      husband Peter of Courtenay, count of Auxerre, was invited by the
      Latins to assume the empire of the East. The royal birth of his
      father, the noble origin of his mother, recommended to the barons
      of France the first cousin of their king. His reputation was
      fair, his possessions were ample, and in the bloody crusade
      against the Albigeois, the soldiers and the priests had been
      abundantly satisfied of his zeal and valor. Vanity might applaud
      the elevation of a French emperor of Constantinople; but prudence
      must pity, rather than envy, his treacherous and imaginary
      greatness. To assert and adorn his title, he was reduced to sell
      or mortgage the best of his patrimony. By these expedients, the
      liberality of his royal kinsman Philip Augustus, and the national
      spirit of chivalry, he was enabled to pass the Alps at the head
      of one hundred and forty knights, and five thousand five hundred
      sergeants and archers. After some hesitation, Pope Honorius the
      Third was persuaded to crown the successor of Constantine: but he
      performed the ceremony in a church without the walls, lest he
      should seem to imply or to bestow any right of sovereignty over
      the ancient capital of the empire. The Venetians had engaged to
      transport Peter and his forces beyond the Adriatic, and the
      empress, with her four children, to the Byzantine palace; but
      they required, as the price of their service, that he should
      recover Durazzo from the despot of Epirus. Michael Angelus, or
      Comnenus, the first of his dynasty, had bequeathed the succession
      of his power and ambition to Theodore, his legitimate brother,
      who already threatened and invaded the establishments of the
      Latins. After discharging his debt by a fruitless assault, the
      emperor raised the siege to prosecute a long and perilous journey
      over land from Durazzo to Thessalonica. He was soon lost in the
      mountains of Epirus: the passes were fortified; his provisions
      exhausted; he was delayed and deceived by a treacherous
      negotiation; and, after Peter of Courtenay and the Roman legate
      had been arrested in a banquet, the French troops, without
      leaders or hopes, were eager to exchange their arms for the
      delusive promise of mercy and bread. The Vatican thundered; and
      the impious Theodore was threatened with the vengeance of earth
      and heaven; but the captive emperor and his soldiers were
      forgotten, and the reproaches of the pope are confined to the
      imprisonment of his legate. No sooner was he satisfied by the
      deliverance of the priests and a promise of spiritual obedience,
      than he pardoned and protected the despot of Epirus. His
      peremptory commands suspended the ardor of the Venetians and the
      king of Hungary; and it was only by a natural or untimely death
      36 that Peter of Courtenay was released from his hopeless
      captivity. 37

      The long ignorance of his fate, and the presence of the lawful
      sovereign, of Yolande, his wife or widow, delayed the
      proclamation of a new emperor. Before her death, and in the midst
      of her grief, she was delivered of a son, who was named Baldwin,
      the last and most unfortunate of the Latin princes of
      Constantinople. His birth endeared him to the barons of Romania;
      but his childhood would have prolonged the troubles of a
      minority, and his claims were superseded by the elder claims of
      his brethren. The first of these, Philip of Courtenay, who
      derived from his mother the inheritance of Namur, had the wisdom
      to prefer the substance of a marquisate to the shadow of an
      empire; and on his refusal, Robert, the second of the sons of
      Peter and Yolande, was called to the throne of Constantinople.
      Warned by his father’s mischance, he pursued his slow and secure
      journey through Germany and along the Danube: a passage was
      opened by his sister’s marriage with the king of Hungary; and the
      emperor Robert was crowned by the patriarch in the cathedral of
      St. Sophia. But his reign was an æra of calamity and disgrace;
      and the colony, as it was styled, of New France yielded on all
      sides to the Greeks of Nice and Epirus. After a victory, which he
      owed to his perfidy rather than his courage, Theodore Angelus
      entered the kingdom of Thessalonica, expelled the feeble
      Demetrius, the son of the marquis Boniface, erected his standard
      on the walls of Adrianople; and added, by his vanity, a third or
      a fourth name to the list of rival emperors. The relics of the
      Asiatic province were swept away by John Vataces, the son-in-law
      and successor of Theodore Lascaris, and who, in a triumphant
      reign of thirty-three years, displayed the virtues both of peace
      and war. Under his discipline, the swords of the French
      mercenaries were the most effectual instruments of his conquests,
      and their desertion from the service of their country was at once
      a symptom and a cause of the rising ascendant of the Greeks. By
      the construction of a fleet, he obtained the command of the
      Hellespont, reduced the islands of Lesbos and Rhodes, attacked
      the Venetians of Candia, and intercepted the rare and
      parsimonious succors of the West. Once, and once only, the Latin
      emperor sent an army against Vataces; and in the defeat of that
      army, the veteran knights, the last of the original conquerors,
      were left on the field of battle. But the success of a foreign
      enemy was less painful to the pusillanimous Robert than the
      insolence of his Latin subjects, who confounded the weakness of
      the emperor and of the empire. His personal misfortunes will
      prove the anarchy of the government and the ferociousness of the
      times. The amorous youth had neglected his Greek bride, the
      daughter of Vataces, to introduce into the palace a beautiful
      maid, of a private, though noble family of Artois; and her mother
      had been tempted by the lustre of the purple to forfeit her
      engagements with a gentleman of Burgundy. His love was converted
      into rage; he assembled his friends, forced the palace gates,
      threw the mother into the sea, and inhumanly cut off the nose and
      lips of the wife or concubine of the emperor. Instead of
      punishing the offender, the barons avowed and applauded the
      savage deed, 38 which, as a prince and as a man, it was
      impossible that Robert should forgive. He escaped from the guilty
      city to implore the justice or compassion of the pope: the
      emperor was coolly exhorted to return to his station; before he
      could obey, he sunk under the weight of grief, shame, and
      impotent resentment. 39

      acknowledges the damsel for the lawful wife of Robert.]

      It was only in the age of chivalry, that valor could ascend from
      a private station to the thrones of Jerusalem and Constantinople.
      The titular kingdom of Jerusalem had devolved to Mary, the
      daughter of Isabella and Conrad of Montferrat, and the
      granddaughter of Almeric or Amaury. She was given to John of
      Brienne, of a noble family in Champagne, by the public voice, and
      the judgment of Philip Augustus, who named him as the most worthy
      champion of the Holy Land. 40 In the fifth crusade, he led a
      hundred thousand Latins to the conquest of Egypt: by him the
      siege of Damietta was achieved; and the subsequent failure was
      justly ascribed to the pride and avarice of the legate. After the
      marriage of his daughter with Frederic the Second, 41 he was
      provoked by the emperor’s ingratitude to accept the command of
      the army of the church; and though advanced in life, and
      despoiled of royalty, the sword and spirit of John of Brienne
      were still ready for the service of Christendom. In the seven
      years of his brother’s reign, Baldwin of Courtenay had not
      emerged from a state of childhood, and the barons of Romania felt
      the strong necessity of placing the sceptre in the hands of a man
      and a hero. The veteran king of Jerusalem might have disdained
      the name and office of regent; they agreed to invest him for his
      life with the title and prerogatives of emperor, on the sole
      condition that Baldwin should marry his second daughter, and
      succeed at a mature age to the throne of Constantinople. The
      expectation, both of the Greeks and Latins, was kindled by the
      renown, the choice, and the presence of John of Brienne; and they
      admired his martial aspect, his green and vigorous age of more
      than fourscore years, and his size and stature, which surpassed
      the common measure of mankind. 42 But avarice, and the love of
      ease, appear to have chilled the ardor of enterprise: 421 his
      troops were disbanded, and two years rolled away without action
      or honor, till he was awakened by the dangerous alliance of
      Vataces emperor of Nice, and of Azan king of Bulgaria. They
      besieged Constantinople by sea and land, with an army of one
      hundred thousand men, and a fleet of three hundred ships of war;
      while the entire force of the Latin emperor was reduced to one
      hundred and sixty knights, and a small addition of sergeants and
      archers. I tremble to relate, that instead of defending the city,
      the hero made a sally at the head of his cavalry; and that of
      forty-eight squadrons of the enemy, no more than three escaped
      from the edge of his invincible sword. Fired by his example, the
      infantry and the citizens boarded the vessels that anchored close
      to the walls; and twenty-five were dragged in triumph into the
      harbor of Constantinople. At the summons of the emperor, the
      vassals and allies armed in her defence; broke through every
      obstacle that opposed their passage; and, in the succeeding year,
      obtained a second victory over the same enemies. By the rude
      poets of the age, John of Brienne is compared to Hector, Roland,
      and Judas Machabæus: 43 but their credit, and his glory, receive
      some abatement from the silence of the Greeks. The empire was
      soon deprived of the last of her champions; and the dying monarch
      was ambitious to enter paradise in the habit of a Franciscan
      friar. 44

      In the double victory of John of Brienne, I cannot discover the
      name or exploits of his pupil Baldwin, who had attained the age
      of military service, and who succeeded to the imperial dignity on
      the decease of his adoptive father. 45 The royal youth was
      employed on a commission more suitable to his temper; he was sent
      to visit the Western courts, of the pope more especially, and of
      the king of France; to excite their pity by the view of his
      innocence and distress; and to obtain some supplies of men or
      money for the relief of the sinking empire. He thrice repeated
      these mendicant visits, in which he seemed to prolong his stay
      and postpone his return; of the five-and-twenty years of his
      reign, a greater number were spent abroad than at home; and in no
      place did the emperor deem himself less free and secure than in
      his native country and his capital. On some public occasions, his
      vanity might be soothed by the title of Augustus, and by the
      honors of the purple; and at the general council of Lyons, when
      Frederic the Second was excommunicated and deposed, his Oriental
      colleague was enthroned on the right hand of the pope. But how
      often was the exile, the vagrant, the Imperial beggar, humbled
      with scorn, insulted with pity, and degraded in his own eyes and
      those of the nations! In his first visit to England, he was
      stopped at Dover by a severe reprimand, that he should presume,
      without leave, to enter an independent kingdom. After some delay,
      Baldwin, however, was permitted to pursue his journey, was
      entertained with cold civility, and thankfully departed with a
      present of seven hundred marks. 46 From the avarice of Rome he
      could only obtain the proclamation of a crusade, and a treasure
      of indulgences; a coin whose currency was depreciated by too
      frequent and indiscriminate abuse. His birth and misfortunes
      recommended him to the generosity of his cousin Louis the Ninth;
      but the martial zeal of the saint was diverted from
      Constantinople to Egypt and Palestine; and the public and private
      poverty of Baldwin was alleviated, for a moment, by the
      alienation of the marquisate of Namur and the lordship of
      Courtenay, the last remains of his inheritance. 47 By such
      shameful or ruinous expedients, he once more returned to Romania,
      with an army of thirty thousand soldiers, whose numbers were
      doubled in the apprehension of the Greeks. His first despatches
      to France and England announced his victories and his hopes: he
      had reduced the country round the capital to the distance of
      three days’ journey; and if he succeeded against an important,
      though nameless, city, (most probably Chiorli,) the frontier
      would be safe and the passage accessible. But these expectations
      (if Baldwin was sincere) quickly vanished like a dream: the
      troops and treasures of France melted away in his unskilful
      hands; and the throne of the Latin emperor was protected by a
      dishonorable alliance with the Turks and Comans. To secure the
      former, he consented to bestow his niece on the unbelieving
      sultan of Cogni; to please the latter, he complied with their
      Pagan rites; a dog was sacrificed between the two armies; and the
      contracting parties tasted each other’s blood, as a pledge of
      their fidelity. 48 In the palace, or prison, of Constantinople,
      the successor of Augustus demolished the vacant houses for winter
      fuel, and stripped the lead from the churches for the daily
      expense of his family. Some usurious loans were dealt with a
      scanty hand by the merchants of Italy; and Philip, his son and
      heir, was pawned at Venice as the security for a debt. 49 Thirst,
      hunger, and nakedness, are positive evils: but wealth is
      relative; and a prince who would be rich in a private station,
      may be exposed by the increase of his wants to all the anxiety
      and bitterness of poverty.

      Chapter LXI: Partition Of The Empire By The French And
      Venetians.—Part III.

      But in this abject distress, the emperor and empire were still
      possessed of an ideal treasure, which drew its fantastic value
      from the superstition of the Christian world. The merit of the
      true cross was somewhat impaired by its frequent division; and a
      long captivity among the infidels might shed some suspicion on
      the fragments that were produced in the East and West. But
      another relic of the Passion was preserved in the Imperial chapel
      of Constantinople; and the crown of thorns which had been placed
      on the head of Christ was equally precious and authentic. It had
      formerly been the practice of the Egyptian debtors to deposit, as
      a security, the mummies of their parents; and both their honor
      and religion were bound for the redemption of the pledge. In the
      same manner, and in the absence of the emperor, the barons of
      Romania borrowed the sum of thirteen thousand one hundred and
      thirty-four pieces of gold 50 on the credit of the holy crown:
      they failed in the performance of their contract; and a rich
      Venetian, Nicholas Querini, undertook to satisfy their impatient
      creditors, on condition that the relic should be lodged at
      Venice, to become his absolute property, if it were not redeemed
      within a short and definite term. The barons apprised their
      sovereign of the hard treaty and impending loss and as the empire
      could not afford a ransom of seven thousand pounds sterling,
      Baldwin was anxious to snatch the prize from the Venetians, and
      to vest it with more honor and emolument in the hands of the most
      Christian king. 51 Yet the negotiation was attended with some
      delicacy. In the purchase of relics, the saint would have started
      at the guilt of simony; but if the mode of expression were
      changed, he might lawfully repay the debt, accept the gift, and
      acknowledge the obligation. His ambassadors, two Dominicans, were
      despatched to Venice to redeem and receive the holy crown which
      had escaped the dangers of the sea and the galleys of Vataces. On
      opening a wooden box, they recognized the seals of the doge and
      barons, which were applied on a shrine of silver; and within this
      shrine the monument of the Passion was enclosed in a golden vase.
      The reluctant Venetians yielded to justice and power: the emperor
      Frederic granted a free and honorable passage; the court of
      France advanced as far as Troyes in Champagne, to meet with
      devotion this inestimable relic: it was borne in triumph through
      Paris by the king himself, barefoot, and in his shirt; and a free
      gift of ten thousand marks of silver reconciled Baldwin to his
      loss. The success of this transaction tempted the Latin emperor
      to offer with the same generosity the remaining furniture of his
      chapel; 52 a large and authentic portion of the true cross; the
      baby-linen of the Son of God, the lance, the sponge, and the
      chain, of his Passion; the rod of Moses, and part of the skull of
      St. John the Baptist. For the reception of these spiritual
      treasures, twenty thousand marks were expended by St. Louis on a
      stately foundation, the holy chapel of Paris, on which the muse
      of Boileau has bestowed a comic immortality. The truth of such
      remote and ancient relics, which cannot be proved by any human
      testimony, must be admitted by those who believe in the miracles
      which they have performed. About the middle of the last age, an
      inveterate ulcer was touched and cured by a holy prickle of the
      holy crown: 53 the prodigy is attested by the most pious and
      enlightened Christians of France; nor will the fact be easily
      disproved, except by those who are armed with a general antidote
      against religious credulity. 54

      The Latins of Constantinople 55 were on all sides encompassed and
      pressed; their sole hope, the last delay of their ruin, was in
      the division of their Greek and Bulgarian enemies; and of this
      hope they were deprived by the superior arms and policy of
      Vataces, emperor of Nice. From the Propontis to the rocky coast
      of Pamphylia, Asia was peaceful and prosperous under his reign;
      and the events of every campaign extended his influence in
      Europe. The strong cities of the hills of Macedonia and Thrace
      were rescued from the Bulgarians; and their kingdom was
      circumscribed by its present and proper limits, along the
      southern banks of the Danube. The sole emperor of the Romans
      could no longer brook that a lord of Epirus, a Comnenian prince
      of the West, should presume to dispute or share the honors of the
      purple; and the humble Demetrius changed the color of his
      buskins, and accepted with gratitude the appellation of despot.
      His own subjects were exasperated by his baseness and incapacity;
      they implored the protection of their supreme lord. After some
      resistance, the kingdom of Thessalonica was united to the empire
      of Nice; and Vataces reigned without a competitor from the
      Turkish borders to the Adriatic Gulf. The princes of Europe
      revered his merit and power; and had he subscribed an orthodox
      creed, it should seem that the pope would have abandoned without
      reluctance the Latin throne of Constantinople. But the death of
      Vataces, the short and busy reign of Theodore his son, and the
      helpless infancy of his grandson John, suspended the restoration
      of the Greeks. In the next chapter, I shall explain their
      domestic revolutions; in this place, it will be sufficient to
      observe, that the young prince was oppressed by the ambition of
      his guardian and colleague, Michael Palæologus, who displayed the
      virtues and vices that belong to the founder of a new dynasty.
      The emperor Baldwin had flattered himself, that he might recover
      some provinces or cities by an impotent negotiation. His
      ambassadors were dismissed from Nice with mockery and contempt.
      At every place which they named, Palæologus alleged some special
      reason, which rendered it dear and valuable in his eyes: in the
      one he was born; in another he had been first promoted to
      military command; and in a third he had enjoyed, and hoped long
      to enjoy, the pleasures of the chase. “And what then do you
      propose to give us?” said the astonished deputies. “Nothing,”
      replied the Greek, “not a foot of land. If your master be
      desirous of peace, let him pay me, as an annual tribute, the sum
      which he receives from the trade and customs of Constantinople.
      On these terms, I may allow him to reign. If he refuses, it is
      war. I am not ignorant of the art of war, and I trust the event
      to God and my sword.” 56 An expedition against the despot of
      Epirus was the first prelude of his arms. If a victory was
      followed by a defeat; if the race of the Comneni or Angeli
      survived in those mountains his efforts and his reign; the
      captivity of Villehardouin, prince of Achaia, deprived the Latins
      of the most active and powerful vassal of their expiring
      monarchy. The republics of Venice and Genoa disputed, in the
      first of their naval wars, the command of the sea and the
      commerce of the East. Pride and interest attached the Venetians
      to the defence of Constantinople; their rivals were tempted to
      promote the designs of her enemies, and the alliance of the
      Genoese with the schismatic conqueror provoked the indignation of
      the Latin church. 57

      Acropolita, and the three first books of Nicephorus, Gregoras,

      fortune to meet with learned editors Leo Allatius at Rome, and
      John Boivin in the Academy of Inscriptions of Paris.]

      the alliance and succor of the Genoese: but the fact is proved by

      Script. Rerum Italicarum, tom. xiii. p. 202, 203) and William de
      Nangis, (Annales de St. Louis, p. 248 in the Louvre Joinville,)
      two impartial foreigners; and Urban IV threatened to deprive
      Genoa of her archbishop.]

      Intent on his great object, the emperor Michael visited in person
      and strengthened the troops and fortifications of Thrace. The
      remains of the Latins were driven from their last possessions: he
      assaulted without success the suburb of Galata; and corresponded
      with a perfidious baron, who proved unwilling, or unable, to open
      the gates of the metropolis. The next spring, his favorite
      general, Alexius Strategopulus, whom he had decorated with the
      title of Cæsar, passed the Hellespont with eight hundred horse
      and some infantry, 58 on a secret expedition. His instructions
      enjoined him to approach, to listen, to watch, but not to risk
      any doubtful or dangerous enterprise against the city. The
      adjacent territory between the Propontis and the Black Sea was
      cultivated by a hardy race of peasants and outlaws, exercised in
      arms, uncertain in their allegiance, but inclined by language,
      religion, and present advantage, to the party of the Greeks. They
      were styled the _volunteers_; 59 and by their free service the
      army of Alexius, with the regulars of Thrace and the Coman
      auxiliaries, 60 was augmented to the number of five-and-twenty
      thousand men. By the ardor of the volunteers, and by his own
      ambition, the Cæsar was stimulated to disobey the precise orders
      of his master, in the just confidence that success would plead
      his pardon and reward. The weakness of Constantinople, and the
      distress and terror of the Latins, were familiar to the
      observation of the volunteers; and they represented the present
      moment as the most propitious to surprise and conquest. A rash
      youth, the new governor of the Venetian colony, had sailed away
      with thirty galleys, and the best of the French knights, on a
      wild expedition to Daphnusia, a town on the Black Sea, at the
      distance of forty leagues; 601 and the remaining Latins were
      without strength or suspicion. They were informed that Alexius
      had passed the Hellespont; but their apprehensions were lulled by
      the smallness of his original numbers; and their imprudence had
      not watched the subsequent increase of his army. If he left his
      main body to second and support his operations, he might advance
      unperceived in the night with a chosen detachment. While some
      applied scaling-ladders to the lowest part of the walls, they
      were secure of an old Greek, who would introduce their companions
      through a subterraneous passage into his house; they could soon
      on the inside break an entrance through the golden gate, which
      had been long obstructed; and the conqueror would be in the heart
      of the city before the Latins were conscious of their danger.
      After some debate, the Cæsar resigned himself to the faith of the
      volunteers; they were trusty, bold, and successful; and in
      describing the plan, I have already related the execution and
      success. 61 But no sooner had Alexius passed the threshold of the
      golden gate, than he trembled at his own rashness; he paused, he
      deliberated; till the desperate volunteers urged him forwards, by
      the assurance that in retreat lay the greatest and most
      inevitable danger. Whilst the Cæsar kept his regulars in firm
      array, the Comans dispersed themselves on all sides; an alarm was
      sounded, and the threats of fire and pillage compelled the
      citizens to a decisive resolution. The Greeks of Constantinople
      remembered their native sovereigns; the Genoese merchants their
      recent alliance and Venetian foes; every quarter was in arms; and
      the air resounded with a general acclamation of “Long life and
      victory to Michael and John, the august emperors of the Romans!”
      Their rival, Baldwin, was awakened by the sound; but the most
      pressing danger could not prompt him to draw his sword in the
      defence of a city which he deserted, perhaps, with more pleasure
      than regret: he fled from the palace to the seashore, where he
      descried the welcome sails of the fleet returning from the vain
      and fruitless attempt on Daphnusia. Constantinople was
      irrecoverably lost; but the Latin emperor and the principal
      families embarked on board the Venetian galleys, and steered for
      the Isle of Euba, and afterwards for Italy, where the royal
      fugitive was entertained by the pope and Sicilian king with a
      mixture of contempt and pity. From the loss of Constantinople to
      his death, he consumed thirteen years, soliciting the Catholic
      powers to join in his restoration: the lesson had been familiar
      to his youth; nor was his last exile more indigent or shameful
      than his three former pilgrimages to the courts of Europe. His
      son Philip was the heir of an ideal empire; and the pretensions
      of his daughter Catherine were transported by her marriage to
      Charles of Valois, the brother of Philip the Fair, king of
      France. The house of Courtenay was represented in the female line
      by successive alliances, till the title of emperor of
      Constantinople, too bulky and sonorous for a private name,
      modestly expired in silence and oblivion. 62

      After this narrative of the expeditions of the Latins to
      Palestine and Constantinople, I cannot dismiss the subject
      without resolving the general consequences on the countries that
      were the scene, and on the nations that were the actors, of these
      memorable crusades. 63 As soon as the arms of the Franks were
      withdrawn, the impression, though not the memory, was erased in
      the Mahometan realms of Egypt and Syria. The faithful disciples
      of the prophet were never tempted by a profane desire to study
      the laws or language of the idolaters; nor did the simplicity of
      their primitive manners receive the slightest alteration from
      their intercourse in peace and war with the unknown strangers of
      the West. The Greeks, who thought themselves proud, but who were
      only vain, showed a disposition somewhat less inflexible. In the
      efforts for the recovery of their empire, they emulated the
      valor, discipline, and tactics of their antagonists. The modern
      literature of the West they might justly despise; but its free
      spirit would instruct them in the rights of man; and some
      institutions of public and private life were adopted from the
      French. The correspondence of Constantinople and Italy diffused
      the knowledge of the Latin tongue; and several of the fathers and
      classics were at length honored with a Greek version. 64 But the
      national and religious prejudices of the Orientals were inflamed
      by persecution, and the reign of the Latins confirmed the
      separation of the two churches.

      63 (return) [ Abulfeda, who saw the conclusion of the crusades,
      speaks of the kingdoms of the Franks, and those of the Negroes,
      as equally unknown, (Prolegom. ad Geograph.) Had he not disdained
      the Latin language, how easily might the Syrian prince have found
      books and interpreters!]

      64 (return) [ A short and superficial account of these versions
      from Latin into Greek is given by Huet, (de Interpretatione et de
      claris Interpretibus p. 131—135.) Maximus Planudes, a monk of
      Constantinople, (A.D. 1327—1353) has translated Cæsar’s
      Commentaries, the Somnium Scipionis, the Metamorphoses and
      Heroides of Ovid, &c., (Fabric. Bib. Græc. tom. x. p. 533.)]

      If we compare the æra of the crusades, the Latins of Europe with
      the Greeks and Arabians, their respective degrees of knowledge,
      industry, and art, our rude ancestors must be content with the
      third rank in the scale of nations. Their successive improvement
      and present superiority may be ascribed to a peculiar energy of
      character, to an active and imitative spirit, unknown to their
      more polished rivals, who at that time were in a stationary or
      retrograde state. With such a disposition, the Latins should have
      derived the most early and essential benefits from a series of
      events which opened to their eyes the prospect of the world, and
      introduced them to a long and frequent intercourse with the more
      cultivated regions of the East. The first and most obvious
      progress was in trade and manufactures, in the arts which are
      strongly prompted by the thirst of wealth, the calls of
      necessity, and the gratification of the sense or vanity. Among
      the crowd of unthinking fanatics, a captive or a pilgrim might
      sometimes observe the superior refinements of Cairo and
      Constantinople: the first importer of windmills 65 was the
      benefactor of nations; and if such blessings are enjoyed without
      any grateful remembrance, history has condescended to notice the
      more apparent luxuries of silk and sugar, which were transported
      into Italy from Greece and Egypt. But the intellectual wants of
      the Latins were more slowly felt and supplied; the ardor of
      studious curiosity was awakened in Europe by different causes and
      more recent events; and, in the age of the crusades, they viewed
      with careless indifference the literature of the Greeks and
      Arabians. Some rudiments of mathematical and medicinal knowledge
      might be imparted in practice and in figures; necessity might
      produce some interpreters for the grosser business of merchants
      and soldiers; but the commerce of the Orientals had not diffused
      the study and knowledge of their languages in the schools of
      Europe. 66 If a similar principle of religion repulsed the idiom
      of the Koran, it should have excited their patience and curiosity
      to understand the original text of the gospel; and the same
      grammar would have unfolded the sense of Plato and the beauties
      of Homer. Yet in a reign of sixty years, the Latins of
      Constantinople disdained the speech and learning of their
      subjects; and the manuscripts were the only treasures which the
      natives might enjoy without rapine or envy. Aristotle was indeed
      the oracle of the Western universities, but it was a barbarous
      Aristotle; and, instead of ascending to the fountain head, his
      Latin votaries humbly accepted a corrupt and remote version, from
      the Jews and Moors of Andalusia. The principle of the crusades
      was a savage fanaticism; and the most important effects were
      analogous to the cause. Each pilgrim was ambitious to return with
      his sacred spoils, the relics of Greece and Palestine; 67 and
      each relic was preceded and followed by a train of miracles and
      visions. The belief of the Catholics was corrupted by new
      legends, their practice by new superstitions; and the
      establishment of the inquisition, the mendicant orders of monks
      and friars, the last abuse of indulgences, and the final progress
      of idolatry, flowed from the baleful fountain of the holy war.
      The active spirit of the Latins preyed on the vitals of their
      reason and religion; and if the ninth and tenth centuries were
      the times of darkness, the thirteenth and fourteenth were the age
      of absurdity and fable.

      Chapter LXI: Partition Of The Empire By The French And
      Venetians.—Part IV.

      In the profession of Christianity, in the cultivation of a
      fertile land, the northern conquerors of the Roman empire
      insensibly mingled with the provincials, and rekindled the embers
      of the arts of antiquity. Their settlements about the age of
      Charlemagne had acquired some degree of order and stability, when
      they were overwhelmed by new swarms of invaders, the Normans,
      Saracens, 68 and Hungarians, who replunged the western countries
      of Europe into their former state of anarchy and barbarism. About
      the eleventh century, the second tempest had subsided by the
      expulsion or conversion of the enemies of Christendom: the tide
      of civilization, which had so long ebbed, began to flow with a
      steady and accelerated course; and a fairer prospect was opened
      to the hopes and efforts of the rising generations. Great was the
      increase, and rapid the progress, during the two hundred years of
      the crusades; and some philosophers have applauded the propitious
      influence of these holy wars, which appear to me to have checked
      rather than forwarded the maturity of Europe. 69 The lives and
      labors of millions, which were buried in the East, would have
      been more profitably employed in the improvement of their native
      country: the accumulated stock of industry and wealth would have
      overflowed in navigation and trade; and the Latins would have
      been enriched and enlightened by a pure and friendly
      correspondence with the climates of the East. In one respect I
      can indeed perceive the accidental operation of the crusades, not
      so much in producing a benefit as in removing an evil. The larger
      portion of the inhabitants of Europe was chained to the soil,
      without freedom, or property, or knowledge; and the two orders of
      ecclesiastics and nobles, whose numbers were comparatively small,
      alone deserved the name of citizens and men. This oppressive
      system was supported by the arts of the clergy and the swords of
      the barons. The authority of the priests operated in the darker
      ages as a salutary antidote: they prevented the total extinction
      of letters, mitigated the fierceness of the times, sheltered the
      poor and defenceless, and preserved or revived the peace and
      order of civil society. But the independence, rapine, and discord
      of the feudal lords were unmixed with any semblance of good; and
      every hope of industry and improvement was crushed by the iron
      weight of the martial aristocracy. Among the causes that
      undermined that Gothic edifice, a conspicuous place must be
      allowed to the crusades. The estates of the barons were
      dissipated, and their race was often extinguished, in these
      costly and perilous expeditions. Their poverty extorted from
      their pride those charters of freedom which unlocked the fetters
      of the slave, secured the farm of the peasant and the shop of the
      artificer, and gradually restored a substance and a soul to the
      most numerous and useful part of the community. The conflagration
      which destroyed the tall and barren trees of the forest gave air
      and scope to the vegetation of the smaller and nutritive plants
      of the soil. 691

      _Digression On The Family Of Courtenay._

      The purple of three emperors, who have reigned at Constantinople,
      will authorize or excuse a digression on the origin and singular
      fortunes of the house of Courtenay, 70 in the three principal
      branches: I. Of Edessa; II. Of France; and III. Of England; of
      which the last only has survived the revolutions of eight hundred
      years.

      70 (return) [ I have applied, but not confined, myself to _A
      genealogical History of the noble and illustrious Family of
      Courtenay, by Ezra Cleaveland, Tutor to Sir William Courtenay,
      and Rector of Honiton; Exon. 1735, in folio._ The first part is
      extracted from William of Tyre; the second from Bouchet’s French
      history; and the third from various memorials, public,
      provincial, and private, of the Courtenays of Devonshire The
      rector of Honiton has more gratitude than industry, and more
      industry than criticism.]

      I. Before the introduction of trade, which scatters riches, and
      of knowledge, which dispels prejudice, the prerogative of birth
      is most strongly felt and most humbly acknowledged. In every age,
      the laws and manners of the Germans have discriminated the ranks
      of society; the dukes and counts, who shared the empire of
      Charlemagne, converted their office to an inheritance; and to his
      children, each feudal lord bequeathed his honor and his sword.
      The proudest families are content to lose, in the darkness of the
      middle ages, the tree of their pedigree, which, however deep and
      lofty, must ultimately rise from a plebeian root; and their
      historians must descend ten centuries below the Christian æra,
      before they can ascertain any lineal succession by the evidence
      of surnames, of arms, and of authentic records. With the first
      rays of light, 71 we discern the nobility and opulence of Atho, a
      French knight; his nobility, in the rank and title of a nameless
      father; his opulence, in the foundation of the castle of
      Courtenay in the district of Gatinois, about fifty-six miles to
      the south of Paris. From the reign of Robert, the son of Hugh
      Capet, the barons of Courtenay are conspicuous among the
      immediate vassals of the crown; and Joscelin, the grandson of
      Atho and a noble dame, is enrolled among the heroes of the first
      crusade. A domestic alliance (their mothers were sisters)
      attached him to the standard of Baldwin of Bruges, the second
      count of Edessa; a princely fief, which he was worthy to receive,
      and able to maintain, announces the number of his martial
      followers; and after the departure of his cousin, Joscelin
      himself was invested with the county of Edessa on both sides of
      the Euphrates. By economy in peace, his territories were
      replenished with Latin and Syrian subjects; his magazines with
      corn, wine, and oil; his castles with gold and silver, with arms
      and horses. In a holy warfare of thirty years, he was alternately
      a conqueror and a captive: but he died like a soldier, in a horse
      litter at the head of his troops; and his last glance beheld the
      flight of the Turkish invaders who had presumed on his age and
      infirmities. His son and successor, of the same name, was less
      deficient in valor than in vigilance; but he sometimes forgot
      that dominion is acquired and maintained by the same arms. He
      challenged the hostility of the Turks, without securing the
      friendship of the prince of Antioch; and, amidst the peaceful
      luxury of Turbessel, in Syria, 72 Joscelin neglected the defence
      of the Christian frontier beyond the Euphrates. In his absence,
      Zenghi, the first of the Atabeks, besieged and stormed his
      capital, Edessa, which was feebly defended by a timorous and
      disloyal crowd of Orientals: the Franks were oppressed in a bold
      attempt for its recovery, and Courtenay ended his days in the
      prison of Aleppo. He still left a fair and ample patrimony But
      the victorious Turks oppressed on all sides the weakness of a
      widow and orphan; and, for the equivalent of an annual pension,
      they resigned to the Greek emperor the charge of defending, and
      the shame of losing, the last relics of the Latin conquest. The
      countess-dowager of Edessa retired to Jerusalem with her two
      children; the daughter, Agnes, became the wife and mother of a
      king; the son, Joscelin the Third, accepted the office of
      seneschal, the first of the kingdom, and held his new estates in
      Palestine by the service of fifty knights. His name appears with
      honor in the transactions of peace and war; but he finally
      vanishes in the fall of Jerusalem; and the name of Courtenay, in
      this branch of Edessa, was lost by the marriage of his two
      daughters with a French and German baron. 73

      Jerusalem (c. B26) among the feudal tenures of the kingdom, which
      must therefore have been collected between the years 1153 and
      1187. His pedigree may be found in the Lignages d’Outremer, c.
      16.]

      II. While Joscelin reigned beyond the Euphrates, his elder
      brother Milo, the son of Joscelin, the son of Atho, continued,
      near the Seine, to possess the castle of their fathers, which was
      at length inherited by Rainaud, or Reginald, the youngest of his
      three sons. Examples of genius or virtue must be rare in the
      annals of the oldest families; and, in a remote age their pride
      will embrace a deed of rapine and violence; such, however, as
      could not be perpetrated without some superiority of courage, or,
      at least, of power. A descendant of Reginald of Courtenay may
      blush for the public robber, who stripped and imprisoned several
      merchants, after they had satisfied the king’s duties at Sens and
      Orleans. He will glory in the offence, since the bold offender
      could not be compelled to obedience and restitution, till the
      regent and the count of Champagne prepared to march against him
      at the head of an army. 74 Reginald bestowed his estates on his
      eldest daughter, and his daughter on the seventh son of King
      Louis the Fat; and their marriage was crowned with a numerous
      offspring. We might expect that a private should have merged in a
      royal name; and that the descendants of Peter of France and
      Elizabeth of Courtenay would have enjoyed the titles and honors
      of princes of the blood. But this legitimate claim was long
      neglected, and finally denied; and the causes of their disgrace
      will represent the story of this second branch. _1._ Of all the
      families now extant, the most ancient, doubtless, and the most
      illustrious, is the house of France, which has occupied the same
      throne above eight hundred years, and descends, in a clear and
      lineal series of males, from the middle of the ninth century. 75
      In the age of the crusades, it was already revered both in the
      East and West. But from Hugh Capet to the marriage of Peter, no
      more than five reigns or generations had elapsed; and so
      precarious was their title, that the eldest sons, as a necessary
      precaution, were previously crowned during the lifetime of their
      fathers. The peers of France have long maintained their
      precedency before the younger branches of the royal line, nor had
      the princes of the blood, in the twelfth century, acquired that
      hereditary lustre which is now diffused over the most remote
      candidates for the succession. _2._ The barons of Courtenay must
      have stood high in their own estimation, and in that of the
      world, since they could impose on the son of a king the
      obligation of adopting for himself and all his descendants the
      name and arms of their daughter and his wife. In the marriage of
      an heiress with her inferior or her equal, such exchange was
      often required and allowed: but as they continued to diverge from
      the regal stem, the sons of Louis the Fat were insensibly
      confounded with their maternal ancestors; and the new Courtenays
      might deserve to forfeit the honors of their birth, which a
      motive of interest had tempted them to renounce. _3._ The shame
      was far more permanent than the reward, and a momentary blaze was
      followed by a long darkness. The eldest son of these nuptials,
      Peter of Courtenay, had married, as I have already mentioned, the
      sister of the counts of Flanders, the two first emperors of
      Constantinople: he rashly accepted the invitation of the barons
      of Romania; his two sons, Robert and Baldwin, successively held
      and lost the remains of the Latin empire in the East, and the
      granddaughter of Baldwin the Second again mingled her blood with
      the blood of France and of Valois. To support the expenses of a
      troubled and transitory reign, their patrimonial estates were
      mortgaged or sold: and the last emperors of Constantinople
      depended on the annual charity of Rome and Naples.

      74 (return) [ The rapine and satisfaction of Reginald de
      Courtenay, are preposterously arranged in the Epistles of the
      abbot and regent Suger, (cxiv. cxvi.,) the best memorials of the
      age, (Duchesne, Scriptores Hist. Franc. tom. iv. p. 530.)]

      75 (return) [ In the beginning of the xith century, after naming
      the father and grandfather of Hugh Capet, the monk Glaber is
      obliged to add, cujus genus valde in-ante reperitur obscurum. Yet
      we are assured that the great-grandfather of Hugh Capet was
      Robert the Strong count of Anjou, (A.D. 863—873,) a noble Frank
      of Neustria, Neustricus... generosæ stirpis, who was slain in the
      defence of his country against the Normans, dum patriæ fines
      tuebatur. Beyond Robert, all is conjecture or fable. It is a
      probable conjecture, that the third race descended from the
      second by Childebrand, the brother of Charles Martel. It is an
      absurd fable that the second was allied to the first by the
      marriage of Ansbert, a Roman senator and the ancestor of St.
      Arnoul, with Blitilde, a daughter of Clotaire I. The Saxon origin
      of the house of France is an ancient but incredible opinion. See
      a judicious memoir of M. de Foncemagne, (Mémoires de l’Académie
      des Inscriptions, tom. xx. p. 548—579.) He had promised to
      declare his own opinion in a second memoir, which has never
      appeared.]

      While the elder brothers dissipated their wealth in romantic
      adventures, and the castle of Courtenay was profaned by a
      plebeian owner, the younger branches of that adopted name were
      propagated and multiplied. But their splendor was clouded by
      poverty and time: after the decease of Robert, great butler of
      France, they descended from princes to barons; the next
      generations were confounded with the simple gentry; the
      descendants of Hugh Capet could no longer be visible in the rural
      lords of Tanlay and of Champignelles. The more adventurous
      embraced without dishonor the profession of a soldier: the least
      active and opulent might sink, like their cousins of the branch
      of Dreux, into the condition of peasants. Their royal descent, in
      a dark period of four hundred years, became each day more
      obsolete and ambiguous; and their pedigree, instead of being
      enrolled in the annals of the kingdom, must be painfully searched
      by the minute diligence of heralds and genealogists. It was not
      till the end of the sixteenth century, on the accession of a
      family almost as remote as their own, that the princely spirit of
      the Courtenays again revived; and the question of the nobility
      provoked them to ascertain the royalty of their blood. They
      appealed to the justice and compassion of Henry the Fourth;
      obtained a favorable opinion from twenty lawyers of Italy and
      Germany, and modestly compared themselves to the descendants of
      King David, whose prerogatives were not impaired by the lapse of
      ages or the trade of a carpenter. 76 But every ear was deaf, and
      every circumstance was adverse, to their lawful claims. The
      Bourbon kings were justified by the neglect of the Valois; the
      princes of the blood, more recent and lofty, disdained the
      alliance of his humble kindred: the parliament, without denying
      their proofs, eluded a dangerous precedent by an arbitrary
      distinction, and established St. Louis as the first father of the
      royal line. 77 A repetition of complaints and protests was
      repeatedly disregarded; and the hopeless pursuit was terminated
      in the present century by the death of the last male of the
      family. 78 Their painful and anxious situation was alleviated by
      the pride of conscious virtue: they sternly rejected the
      temptations of fortune and favor; and a dying Courtenay would
      have sacrificed his son, if the youth could have renounced, for
      any temporal interest, the right and title of a legitimate prince
      of the blood of France. 79

      justice. The sanctity of Louis IX. could not invest him with any
      special prerogative, and all the descendants of Hugh Capet must
      be included in his original compact with the French nation.]

      (February 7th, 1737) by an _arrêt_ of the parliament of Paris.]

      III. According to the old register of Ford Abbey, the Courtenays
      of Devonshire are descended from Prince _Florus_, the second son
      of Peter, and the grandson of Louis the Fat. 80 This fable of the
      grateful or venal monks was too respectfully entertained by our
      antiquaries, Cambden 81 and Dugdale: 82 but it is so clearly
      repugnant to truth and time, that the rational pride of the
      family now refuses to accept this imaginary founder. Their most
      faithful historians believe, that, after giving his daughter to
      the king’s son, Reginald of Courtenay abandoned his possessions
      in France, and obtained from the English monarch a second wife
      and a new inheritance. It is certain, at least, that Henry the
      Second distinguished in his camps and councils a Reginald, of the
      name and arms, and, as it may be fairly presumed, of the genuine
      race, of the Courtenays of France. The right of wardship enabled
      a feudal lord to reward his vassal with the marriage and estate
      of a noble heiress; and Reginald of Courtenay acquired a fair
      establishment in Devonshire, where his posterity has been seated
      above six hundred years. 83 From a Norman baron, Baldwin de
      Brioniis, who had been invested by the Conqueror, Hawise, the
      wife of Reginald, derived the honor of Okehampton, which was held
      by the service of ninety-three knights; and a female might claim
      the manly offices of hereditary viscount or sheriff, and of
      captain of the royal castle of Exeter. Their son Robert married
      the sister of the earl of Devon: at the end of a century, on the
      failure of the family of Rivers, 84 his great-grandson, Hugh the
      Second, succeeded to a title which was still considered as a
      territorial dignity; and twelve earls of Devonshire, of the name
      of Courtenay, have flourished in a period of two hundred and
      twenty years. They were ranked among the chief of the barons of
      the realm; nor was it till after a strenuous dispute, that they
      yielded to the fief of Arundel the first place in the parliament
      of England: their alliances were contracted with the noblest
      families, the Veres, Despensers, St. Johns, Talbots, Bohuns, and
      even the Plantagenets themselves; and in a contest with John of
      Lancaster, a Courtenay, bishop of London, and afterwards
      archbishop of Canterbury, might be accused of profane confidence
      in the strength and number of his kindred. In peace, the earls of
      Devon resided in their numerous castles and manors of the west;
      their ample revenue was appropriated to devotion and hospitality;
      and the epitaph of Edward, surnamed from his misfortune, the
      _blind_, from his virtues, the _good_, earl, inculcates with much
      ingenuity a moral sentence, which may, however, be abused by
      thoughtless generosity. After a grateful commemoration of the
      fifty-five years of union and happiness which he enjoyed with
      Mabe his wife, the good earl thus speaks from the tomb:—

     “What we gave, we have; What we spent, we had; What we left, we
     lost.” 85

      But their _losses_, in this sense, were far superior to their
      gifts and expenses; and their heirs, not less than the poor, were
      the objects of their paternal care. The sums which they paid for
      livery and seizin attest the greatness of their possessions; and
      several estates have remained in their family since the
      thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. In war, the Courtenays of
      England fulfilled the duties, and deserved the honors, of
      chivalry. They were often intrusted to levy and command the
      militia of Devonshire and Cornwall; they often attended their
      supreme lord to the borders of Scotland; and in foreign service,
      for a stipulated price, they sometimes maintained fourscore
      men-at-arms and as many archers. By sea and land they fought
      under the standard of the Edwards and Henries: their names are
      conspicuous in battles, in tournaments, and in the original list
      of the Order of the Garter; three brothers shared the Spanish
      victory of the Black Prince; and in the lapse of six generations,
      the English Courtenays had learned to despise the nation and
      country from which they derived their origin. In the quarrel of
      the two roses, the earls of Devon adhered to the house of
      Lancaster; and three brothers successively died either in the
      field or on the scaffold. Their honors and estates were restored
      by Henry the Seventh; a daughter of Edward the Fourth was not
      disgraced by the nuptials of a Courtenay; their son, who was
      created Marquis of Exeter, enjoyed the favor of his cousin Henry
      the Eighth; and in the camp of Cloth of Gold, he broke a lance
      against the French monarch. But the favor of Henry was the
      prelude of disgrace; his disgrace was the signal of death; and of
      the victims of the jealous tyrant, the marquis of Exeter is one
      of the most noble and guiltless. His son Edward lived a prisoner
      in the Tower, and died in exile at Padua; and the secret love of
      Queen Mary, whom he slighted, perhaps for the princess Elizabeth,
      has shed a romantic color on the story of this beautiful youth.
      The relics of his patrimony were conveyed into strange families
      by the marriages of his four aunts; and his personal honors, as
      if they had been legally extinct, were revived by the patents of
      succeeding princes. But there still survived a lineal descendant
      of Hugh, the first earl of Devon, a younger branch of the
      Courtenays, who have been seated at Powderham Castle above four
      hundred years, from the reign of Edward the Third to the present
      hour. Their estates have been increased by the grant and
      improvement of lands in Ireland, and they have been recently
      restored to the honors of the peerage. Yet the Courtenays still
      retain the plaintive motto, which asserts the innocence, and
      deplores the fall, of their ancient house. 86 While they sigh for
      past greatness, they are doubtless sensible of present blessings:
      in the long series of the Courtenay annals, the most splendid æra
      is likewise the most unfortunate; nor can an opulent peer of
      Britain be inclined to envy the emperors of Constantinople, who
      wandered over Europe to solicit alms for the support of their
      dignity and the defence of their capital.
