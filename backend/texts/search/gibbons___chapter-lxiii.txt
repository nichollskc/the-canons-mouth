     Civil Wars, And Ruin Of The Greek Empire.—Reigns Of Andronicus,
     The Elder And Younger, And John Palæologus.— Regency, Revolt,
     Reign, And Abdication Of John Cantacuzene.— Establishment Of A
     Genoese Colony At Pera Or Galata.—Their Wars With The Empire And
     City Of Constantinople.

      The long reign of Andronicus 1 the elder is chiefly memorable by
      the disputes of the Greek church, the invasion of the Catalans,
      and the rise of the Ottoman power. He is celebrated as the most
      learned and virtuous prince of the age; but such virtue, and such
      learning, contributed neither to the perfection of the
      individual, nor to the happiness of society. A slave of the most
      abject superstition, he was surrounded on all sides by visible
      and invisible enemies; nor were the flames of hell less dreadful
      to his fancy, than those of a Catalan or Turkish war. Under the
      reign of the Palæologi, the choice of the patriarch was the most
      important business of the state; the heads of the Greek church
      were ambitious and fanatic monks; and their vices or virtues,
      their learning or ignorance, were equally mischievous or
      contemptible. By his intemperate discipline, the patriarch
      Athanasius 2 excited the hatred of the clergy and people: he was
      heard to declare, that the sinner should swallow the last dregs
      of the cup of penance; and the foolish tale was propagated of his
      punishing a sacrilegious ass that had tasted the lettuce of a
      convent garden. Driven from the throne by the universal clamor,
      Athanasius composed before his retreat two papers of a very
      opposite cast. His public testament was in the tone of charity
      and resignation; the private codicil breathed the direst
      anathemas against the authors of his disgrace, whom he excluded
      forever from the communion of the holy trinity, the angels, and
      the saints. This last paper he enclosed in an earthen pot, which
      was placed, by his order, on the top of one of the pillars, in
      the dome of St. Sophia, in the distant hope of discovery and
      revenge. At the end of four years, some youths, climbing

       by a ladder in search of pigeons’ nests, detected the fatal
       secret; and,

      as Andronicus felt himself touched and bound by the
      excommunication, he trembled on the brink of the abyss which had
      been so treacherously dug under his feet. A synod of bishops was
      instantly convened to debate this important question: the
      rashness of these clandestine anathemas was generally condemned;
      but as the knot could be untied only by the same hand, as that
      hand was now deprived of the crosier, it appeared that this
      posthumous decree was irrevocable by any earthly power. Some
      faint testimonies of repentance and pardon were extorted from the
      author of the mischief; but the conscience of the emperor was
      still wounded, and he desired, with no less ardor than Athanasius
      himself, the restoration of a patriarch, by whom alone he could
      be healed. At the dead of night, a monk rudely knocked at the
      door of the royal bed-chamber, announcing a revelation of plague
      and famine, of inundations and earthquakes. Andronicus started
      from his bed, and spent the night in prayer, till he felt, or
      thought that he felt, a slight motion of the earth. The emperor
      on foot led the bishops and monks to the cell of Athanasius; and,
      after a proper resistance, the saint, from whom this message had
      been sent, consented to absolve the prince, and govern the church
      of Constantinople. Untamed by disgrace, and hardened by solitude,
      the shepherd was again odious to the flock, and his enemies
      contrived a singular, and as it proved, a successful, mode of
      revenge. In the night, they stole away the footstool or
      foot-cloth of his throne, which they secretly replaced with the
      decoration of a satirical picture. The emperor was painted with a
      bridle in his mouth, and Athanasius leading the tractable beast
      to the feet of Christ. The authors of the libel were detected and
      punished; but as their lives had been spared, the Christian
      priest in sullen indignation retired to his cell; and the eyes of
      Andronicus, which had been opened for a moment, were again closed
      by his successor.

      1 (return) [ Andronicus himself will justify our freedom in the
      invective, (Nicephorus Gregoras, l. i. c. i.,) which he
      pronounced against historic falsehood. It is true, that his
      censure is more pointedly urged against calumny than against
      adulation.]

      2 (return) [ For the anathema in the pigeon’s nest, see Pachymer,
      (l. ix. c. 24,) who relates the general history of Athanasius,
      (l. viii. c. 13—16, 20, 24, l. x. c. 27—29, 31—36, l. xi. c. 1—3,
      5, 6, l. xiii. c. 8, 10, 23, 35,) and is followed by Nicephorus
      Gregoras, (l. vi. c. 5, 7, l. vii. c. 1, 9,) who includes the
      second retreat of this second Chrysostom.]

      If this transaction be one of the most curious and important of a
      reign of fifty years, I cannot at least accuse the brevity of my
      materials, since I reduce into some few pages the enormous folios
      of Pachymer, 3 Cantacuzene, 4 and Nicephorus Gregoras, 5 who have
      composed the prolix and languid story of the times. The name and
      situation of the emperor John Cantacuzene might inspire the most
      lively curiosity. His memorials of forty years extend from the
      revolt of the younger Andronicus to his own abdication of the
      empire; and it is observed, that, like Moses and Cæsar, he was
      the principal actor in the scenes which he describes. But in this
      eloquent work we should vainly seek the sincerity of a hero or a
      penitent. Retired in a cloister from the vices and passions of
      the world, he presents not a confession, but an apology, of the
      life of an ambitious statesman. Instead of unfolding the true
      counsels and characters of men, he displays the smooth and
      specious surface of events, highly varnished with his own praises
      and those of his friends. Their motives are always pure; their
      ends always legitimate: they conspire and rebel without any views
      of interest; and the violence which they inflict or suffer is
      celebrated as the spontaneous effect of reason and virtue.

      3 (return) [ Pachymer, in seven books, 377 folio pages, describes
      the first twenty-six years of Andronicus the Elder; and marks the
      date of his composition by the current news or lie of the day,
      (A.D. 1308.) Either death or disgust prevented him from resuming
      the pen.]

      4 (return) [ After an interval of twelve years, from the
      conclusion of Pachymer, Cantacuzenus takes up the pen; and his
      first book (c. 1—59, p. 9—150) relates the civil war, and the
      eight last years of the elder Andronicus. The ingenious
      comparison with Moses and Cæsar is fancied by his French
      translator, the president Cousin.]

      5 (return) [ Nicephorus Gregoras more briefly includes the entire
      life and reign of Andronicus the elder, (l. vi. c. 1, p. 96—291.)
      This is the part of which Cantacuzene complains as a false and
      malicious representation of his conduct.]

      After the example of the first of the Palæologi, the elder
      Andronicus associated his son Michael to the honors of the
      purple; and from the age of eighteen to his premature death, that
      prince was acknowledged, above twenty-five years, as the second
      emperor of the Greeks. 6 At the head of an army, he excited
      neither the fears of the enemy, nor the jealousy of the court;
      his modesty and patience were never tempted to compute the years
      of his father; nor was that father compelled to repent of his
      liberality either by the virtues or vices of his son. The son of
      Michael was named Andronicus from his grandfather, to whose early
      favor he was introduced by that nominal resemblance. The blossoms
      of wit and beauty increased the fondness of the elder Andronicus;
      and, with the common vanity of age, he expected to realize in the
      second, the hope which had been disappointed in the first,
      generation. The boy was educated in the palace as an heir and a
      favorite; and in the oaths and acclamations of the people, the
      _august triad_ was formed by the names of the father, the son,
      and the grandson. But the younger Andronicus was speedily
      corrupted by his infant greatness, while he beheld with puerile
      impatience the double obstacle that hung, and might long hang,
      over his rising ambition. It was not to acquire fame, or to
      diffuse happiness, that he so eagerly aspired: wealth and
      impunity were in his eyes the most precious attributes of a
      monarch; and his first indiscreet demand was the sovereignty of
      some rich and fertile island, where he might lead a life of
      independence and pleasure. The emperor was offended by the loud
      and frequent intemperance which disturbed his capital; the sums
      which his parsimony denied were supplied by the Genoese usurers
      of Pera; and the oppressive debt, which consolidated the interest
      of a faction, could be discharged only by a revolution. A
      beautiful female, a matron in rank, a prostitute in manners, had
      instructed the younger Andronicus in the rudiments of love; but
      he had reason to suspect the nocturnal visits of a rival; and a
      stranger passing through the street was pierced by the arrows of
      his guards, who were placed in ambush at her door. That stranger
      was his brother, Prince Manuel, who languished and died of his
      wound; and the emperor Michael, their common father, whose health
      was in a declining state, expired on the eighth day, lamenting
      the loss of both his children. 7 However guiltless in his
      intention, the younger Andronicus might impute a brother’s and a
      father’s death to the consequence of his own vices; and deep was
      the sigh of thinking and feeling men, when they perceived,
      instead of sorrow and repentance, his ill-dissembled joy on the
      removal of two odious competitors. By these melancholy events,
      and the increase of his disorders, the mind of the elder emperor
      was gradually alienated; and, after many fruitless reproofs, he
      transferred on another grandson 8 his hopes and affection. The
      change was announced by the new oath of allegiance to the
      reigning sovereign, and the _person_ whom he should appoint for
      his successor; and the acknowledged heir, after a repetition of
      insults and complaints, was exposed to the indignity of a public
      trial. Before the sentence, which would probably have condemned
      him to a dungeon or a cell, the emperor was informed that the
      palace courts were filled with the armed followers of his
      grandson; the judgment was softened to a treaty of
      reconciliation; and the triumphant escape of the prince
      encouraged the ardor of the younger faction.

      6 (return) [ He was crowned May 21st, 1295, and died October
      12th, 1320, (Ducange, Fam. Byz. p. 239.) His brother Theodore, by
      a second marriage, inherited the marquisate of Montferrat,
      apostatized to the religion and manners of the Latins, (oti kai
      gnwmh kai pistei kai schkati, kai geneiwn koura kai pasin eqesin
      DatinoV hn akraijnhV. Nic. Greg. l. ix. c. 1,) and founded a
      dynasty of Italian princes, which was extinguished A.D. 1533,
      (Ducange, Fam. Byz. p. 249—253.)]

      7 (return) [ We are indebted to Nicephorus Gregoras (l. viii. c.
      1) for the knowledge of this tragic adventure; while Cantacuzene
      more discreetly conceals the vices of Andronicus the Younger, of
      which he was the witness and perhaps the associate, (l. i. c. 1,
      &c.)]

      8 (return) [ His destined heir was Michael Catharus, the bastard
      of Constantine his second son. In this project of excluding his
      grandson Andronicus, Nicephorus Gregoras (l. viii. c. 3) agrees
      with Cantacuzene, (l. i. c. 1, 2.)]

      Yet the capital, the clergy, and the senate, adhered to the
      person, or at least to the government, of the old emperor; and it
      was only in the provinces, by flight, and revolt, and foreign
      succor, that the malecontents could hope to vindicate their cause
      and subvert his throne. The soul of the enterprise was the great
      domestic John Cantacuzene; the sally from Constantinople is the
      first date of his actions and memorials; and if his own pen be
      most descriptive of his patriotism, an unfriendly historian has
      not refused to celebrate the zeal and ability which he displayed
      in the service of the young emperor. 89 That prince escaped from
      the capital under the pretence of hunting; erected his standard
      at Adrianople; and, in a few days, assembled fifty thousand horse
      and foot, whom neither honor nor duty could have armed against
      the Barbarians. Such a force might have saved or commanded the
      empire; but their counsels were discordant, their motions were
      slow and doubtful, and their progress was checked by intrigue and
      negotiation. The quarrel of the two Andronici was protracted, and
      suspended, and renewed, during a ruinous period of seven years.
      In the first treaty, the relics of the Greek empire were divided:
      Constantinople, Thessalonica, and the islands, were left to the
      elder, while the younger acquired the sovereignty of the greatest
      part of Thrace, from Philippi to the Byzantine limit. By the
      second treaty, he stipulated the payment of his troops, his
      immediate coronation, and an adequate share of the power and
      revenue of the state. The third civil war was terminated by the
      surprise of Constantinople, the final retreat of the old emperor,
      and the sole reign of his victorious grandson. The reasons of
      this delay may be found in the characters of the men and of the
      times. When the heir of the monarchy first pleaded his wrongs and
      his apprehensions, he was heard with pity and applause: and his
      adherents repeated on all sides the inconsistent promise, that he
      would increase the pay of the soldiers and alleviate the burdens
      of the people. The grievances of forty years were mingled in his
      revolt; and the rising generation was fatigued by the endless
      prospect of a reign, whose favorites and maxims were of other
      times. The youth of Andronicus had been without spirit, his age
      was without reverence: his taxes produced an unusual revenue of
      five hundred thousand pounds; yet the richest of the sovereigns
      of Christendom was incapable of maintaining three thousand horse
      and twenty galleys, to resist the destructive progress of the
      Turks. 9 “How different,” said the younger Andronicus, “is my
      situation from that of the son of Philip! Alexander might
      complain, that his father would leave him nothing to conquer:
      alas! my grandsire will leave me nothing to lose.” But the Greeks
      were soon admonished, that the public disorders could not be
      healed by a civil war; and that their young favorite was not
      destined to be the savior of a falling empire. On the first
      repulse, his party was broken by his own levity, their intestine
      discord, and the intrigues of the ancient court, which tempted
      each malecontent to desert or betray the cause of the rebellion.
      Andronicus the younger was touched with remorse, or fatigued with
      business, or deceived by negotiation: pleasure rather than power
      was his aim; and the license of maintaining a thousand hounds, a
      thousand hawks, and a thousand huntsmen, was sufficient to sully
      his fame and disarm his ambition.

      89 (return) [ The conduct of Cantacuzene, by his own showing, was
      inexplicable. He was unwilling to dethrone the old emperor, and
      dissuaded the immediate march on Constantinople. The young
      Andronicus, he says, entered into his views, and wrote to warn
      the emperor of his danger when the march was determined.
      Cantacuzenus, in Nov. Byz. Hist. Collect. vol. i. p. 104, &c.—M.]

      9 (return) [ See Nicephorus Gregoras, l. viii. c. 6. The younger
      Andronicus complained, that in four years and four months a sum
      of 350,000 byzants of gold was due to him for the expenses of his
      household, (Cantacuzen l. i. c. 48.) Yet he would have remitted
      the debt, if he might have been allowed to squeeze the farmers of
      the revenue.]

      Let us now survey the catastrophe of this busy plot, and the
      final situation of the principal actors. 10 The age of Andronicus
      was consumed in civil discord; and, amidst the events of war and
      treaty, his power and reputation continually decayed, till the
      fatal night in which the gates of the city and palace were opened
      without resistance to his grandson. His principal commander
      scorned the repeated warnings of danger; and retiring to rest in
      the vain security of ignorance, abandoned the feeble monarch,
      with some priests and pages, to the terrors of a sleepless night.
      These terrors were quickly realized by the hostile shouts, which
      proclaimed the titles and victory of Andronicus the younger; and
      the aged emperor, falling prostrate before an image of the
      Virgin, despatched a suppliant message to resign the sceptre, and
      to obtain his life at the hands of the conqueror. The answer of
      his grandson was decent and pious; at the prayer of his friends,
      the younger Andronicus assumed the sole administration; but the
      elder still enjoyed the name and preeminence of the first
      emperor, the use of the great palace, and a pension of
      twenty-four thousand pieces of gold, one half of which was
      assigned on the royal treasury, and the other on the fishery of
      Constantinople. But his impotence was soon exposed to contempt
      and oblivion; the vast silence of the palace was disturbed only
      by the cattle and poultry of the neighborhood, 101 which roved
      with impunity through the solitary courts; and a reduced
      allowance of ten thousand pieces of gold 11 was all that he could
      ask, and more than he could hope. His calamities were imbittered
      by the gradual extinction of sight; his confinement was rendered
      each day more rigorous; and during the absence and sickness of
      his grandson, his inhuman keepers, by the threats of instant
      death, compelled him to exchange the purple for the monastic
      habit and profession. The monk _Antony_ had renounced the pomp of
      the world; yet he had occasion for a coarse fur in the winter
      season, and as wine was forbidden by his confessor, and water by
      his physician, the sherbet of Egypt was his common drink. It was
      not without difficulty that the late emperor could procure three
      or four pieces to satisfy these simple wants; and if he bestowed
      the gold to relieve the more painful distress of a friend, the
      sacrifice is of some weight in the scale of humanity and
      religion. Four years after his abdication, Andronicus or Antony
      expired in a cell, in the seventy-fourth year of his age: and the
      last strain of adulation could only promise a more splendid crown
      of glory in heaven than he had enjoyed upon earth. 12 121

      10 (return) [ I follow the chronology of Nicephorus Gregoras, who
      is remarkably exact. It is proved that Cantacuzene has mistaken
      the dates of his own actions, or rather that his text has been
      corrupted by ignorant transcribers.]

      101 (return) [ And the washerwomen, according to Nic. Gregoras,
      p. 431.—M.]

      11 (return) [ I have endeavored to reconcile the 24,000 pieces of
      Cantacuzene (l. ii. c. 1) with the 10,000 of Nicephorus Gregoras,
      (l. ix. c. 2;) the one of whom wished to soften, the other to
      magnify, the hardships of the old emperor.]

      12 (return) [ See Nicephorus Gregoras, (l. ix. 6, 7, 8, 10, 14,
      l. x. c. 1.) The historian had tasted of the prosperity, and
      shared the retreat, of his benefactor; and that friendship which
      “waits or to the scaffold or the cell,” should not lightly be
      accused as “a hireling, a prostitute to praise.” * Note: But it
      may be accused of unparalleled absurdity. He compares the
      extinction of the feeble old man to that of the sun: his coffin
      is to be floated like Noah’s ark by a deluge of tears.—M.]

      121 (return) [ Prodigies (according to Nic. Gregoras, p. 460)
      announced the departure of the old and imbecile Imperial Monk
      from his earthly prison.—M.]

      Nor was the reign of the younger, more glorious or fortunate than
      that of the elder, Andronicus. 13 He gathered the fruits of
      ambition; but the taste was transient and bitter: in the supreme
      station he lost the remains of his early popularity; and the
      defects of his character became still more conspicuous to the
      world. The public reproach urged him to march in person against
      the Turks; nor did his courage fail in the hour of trial; but a
      defeat and a wound were the only trophies of his expedition in
      Asia, which confirmed the establishment of the Ottoman monarchy.
      The abuses of the civil government attained their full maturity
      and perfection: his neglect of forms, and the confusion of
      national dresses, are deplored by the Greeks as the fatal
      symptoms of the decay of the empire. Andronicus was old before
      his time; the intemperance of youth had accelerated the
      infirmities of age; and after being rescued from a dangerous
      malady by nature, or physic, or the Virgin, he was snatched away
      before he had accomplished his forty-fifth year. He was twice
      married; and, as the progress of the Latins in arms and arts had
      softened the prejudices of the Byzantine court, his two wives
      were chosen in the princely houses of Germany and Italy. The
      first, Agnes at home, Irene in Greece, was daughter of the duke
      of Brunswick. Her father 14 was a petty lord 15 in the poor and
      savage regions of the north of Germany: 16 yet he derived some
      revenue from his silver mines; 17 and his family is celebrated by
      the Greeks as the most ancient and noble of the Teutonic name. 18
      After the death of this childish princess, Andronicus sought in
      marriage Jane, the sister of the count of Savoy; 19 and his suit
      was preferred to that of the French king. 20 The count respected
      in his sister the superior majesty of a Roman empress: her
      retinue was composed of knights and ladies; she was regenerated
      and crowned in St. Sophia, under the more orthodox appellation of
      Anne; and, at the nuptial feast, the Greeks and Italians vied
      with each other in the martial exercises of tilts and
      tournaments.

      13 (return) [ The sole reign of Andronicus the younger is
      described by Cantacuzene (l. ii. c. 1—40, p. 191—339) and
      Nicephorus Gregoras, (l. ix c. 7—l. xi. c. 11, p. 262—361.)]

      14 (return) [ Agnes, or Irene, was the daughter of Duke Henry the
      Wonderful, the chief of the house of Brunswick, and the fourth in
      descent from the famous Henry the Lion, duke of Saxony and
      Bavaria, and conqueror of the Sclavi on the Baltic coast. Her
      brother Henry was surnamed the _Greek_, from his two journeys
      into the East: but these journeys were subsequent to his sister’s
      marriage; and I am ignorant _how_ Agnes was discovered in the
      heart of Germany, and recommended to the Byzantine court.
      (Rimius, Memoirs of the House of Brunswick, p. 126—137.]

      15 (return) [ Henry the Wonderful was the founder of the branch
      of Grubenhagen, extinct in the year 1596, (Rimius, p. 287.) He
      resided in the castle of Wolfenbuttel, and possessed no more than
      a sixth part of the allodial estates of Brunswick and Luneburgh,
      which the Guelph family had saved from the confiscation of their
      great fiefs. The frequent partitions among brothers had almost
      ruined the princely houses of Germany, till that just, but
      pernicious, law was slowly superseded by the right of
      primogeniture. The principality of Grubenhagen, one of the last
      remains of the Hercynian forest, is a woody, mountainous, and
      barren tract, (Busching’s Geography, vol. vi. p. 270—286, English
      translation.)]

      16 (return) [ The royal author of the Memoirs of Brandenburgh
      will teach us, how justly, in a much later period, the north of
      Germany deserved the epithets of poor and barbarous. (Essai sur
      les Murs, &c.) In the year 1306, in the woods of Luneburgh, some
      wild people of the Vened race were allowed to bury alive their
      infirm and useless parents. (Rimius, p. 136.)]

      17 (return) [ The assertion of Tacitus, that Germany was
      destitute of the precious metals, must be taken, even in his own

      Cantacuzene, l. i. c. 40—42.)]

      20 (return) [ That king, if the fact be true, must have been
      Charles the Fair who in five years (1321—1326) was married to
      three wives, (Anderson, p. 628.) Anne of Savoy arrived at
      Constantinople in February, 1326.]

      The empress Anne of Savoy survived her husband: their son, John
      Palæologus, was left an orphan and an emperor in the ninth year
      of his age; and his weakness was protected by the first and most
      deserving of the Greeks. The long and cordial friendship of his
      father for John Cantacuzene is alike honorable to the prince and
      the subject. It had been formed amidst the pleasures of their
      youth: their families were almost equally noble; 21 and the
      recent lustre of the purple was amply compensated by the energy
      of a private education. We have seen that the young emperor was
      saved by Cantacuzene from the power of his grandfather; and,
      after six years of civil war, the same favorite brought him back
      in triumph to the palace of Constantinople. Under the reign of
      Andronicus the younger, the great domestic ruled the emperor and
      the empire; and it was by his valor and conduct that the Isle of
      Lesbos and the principality of Ætolia were restored to their
      ancient allegiance. His enemies confess, that, among the public
      robbers, Cantacuzene alone was moderate and abstemious; and the
      free and voluntary account which he produces of his own wealth 22
      may sustain the presumption that he was devolved by inheritance,
      and not accumulated by rapine. He does not indeed specify the
      value of his money, plate, and jewels; yet, after a voluntary
      gift of two hundred vases of silver, after much had been secreted
      by his friends and plundered by his foes, his forfeit treasures
      were sufficient for the equipment of a fleet of seventy galleys.
      He does not measure the size and number of his estates; but his
      granaries were heaped with an incredible store of wheat and
      barley; and the labor of a thousand yoke of oxen might cultivate,
      according to the practice of antiquity, about sixty-two thousand
      five hundred acres of arable land. 23 His pastures were stocked
      with two thousand five hundred brood mares, two hundred camels,
      three hundred mules, five hundred asses, five thousand horned
      cattle, fifty thousand hogs, and seventy thousand sheep: 24 a
      precious record of rural opulence, in the last period of the
      empire, and in a land, most probably in Thrace, so repeatedly
      wasted by foreign and domestic hostility. The favor of
      Cantacuzene was above his fortune. In the moments of familiarity,
      in the hour of sickness, the emperor was desirous to level the
      distance between them and pressed his friend to accept the diadem
      and purple. The virtue of the great domestic, which is attested
      by his own pen, resisted the dangerous proposal; but the last
      testament of Andronicus the younger named him the guardian of his
      son, and the regent of the empire.

      Had the regent found a suitable return of obedience and
      gratitude, perhaps he would have acted with pure and zealous
      fidelity in the service of his pupil. 25 A guard of five hundred
      soldiers watched over his person and the palace; the funeral of
      the late emperor was decently performed; the capital was silent
      and submissive; and five hundred letters, which Cantacuzene
      despatched in the first month, informed the provinces of their
      loss and their duty. The prospect of a tranquil minority was
      blasted by the great duke or admiral Apocaucus, and to exaggerate
      _his_ perfidy, the Imperial historian is pleased to magnify his
      own imprudence, in raising him to that office against the advice
      of his more sagacious sovereign. Bold and subtle, rapacious and
      profuse, the avarice and ambition of Apocaucus were by turns
      subservient to each other; and his talents were applied to the
      ruin of his country. His arrogance was heightened by the command
      of a naval force and an impregnable castle, and under the mask of
      oaths and flattery he secretly conspired against his benefactor.
      The female court of the empress was bribed and directed; he
      encouraged Anne of Savoy to assert, by the law of nature, the
      tutelage of her son; the love of power was disguised by the
      anxiety of maternal tenderness: and the founder of the Palæologi
      had instructed his posterity to dread the example of a perfidious
      guardian. The patriarch John of Apri was a proud and feeble old
      man, encompassed by a numerous and hungry kindred. He produced an
      obsolete epistle of Andronicus, which bequeathed the prince and
      people to his pious care: the fate of his predecessor Arsenius
      prompted him to prevent, rather than punish, the crimes of a
      usurper; and Apocaucus smiled at the success of his own flattery,
      when he beheld the Byzantine priest assuming the state and
      temporal claims of the Roman pontiff. 26 Between three persons so
      different in their situation and character, a private league was
      concluded: a shadow of authority was restored to the senate; and
      the people was tempted by the name of freedom. By this powerful
      confederacy, the great domestic was assaulted at first with
      clandestine, at length with open, arms. His prerogatives were
      disputed; his opinions slighted; his friends persecuted; and his
      safety was threatened both in the camp and city. In his absence
      on the public service, he was accused of treason; proscribed as
      an enemy of the church and state; and delivered with all his
      adherents to the sword of justice, the vengeance of the people,
      and the power of the devil; his fortunes were confiscated; his
      aged mother was cast into prison; 261 all his past services were
      buried in oblivion; and he was driven by injustice to perpetrate
      the crime of which he was accused. 27 From the review of his
      preceding conduct, Cantacuzene appears to have been guiltless of
      any treasonable designs; and the only suspicion of his innocence
      must arise from the vehemence of his protestations, and the
      sublime purity which he ascribes to his own virtue. While the
      empress and the patriarch still affected the appearances of
      harmony, he repeatedly solicited the permission of retiring to a
      private, and even a monastic, life. After he had been declared a
      public enemy, it was his fervent wish to throw himself at the
      feet of the young emperor, and to receive without a murmur the
      stroke of the executioner: it was not without reluctance that he
      listened to the voice of reason, which inculcated the sacred duty
      of saving his family and friends, and proved that he could only
      save them by drawing the sword and assuming the Imperial title.

      Chapter LXIII: Civil Wars And The Ruin Of The Greek Empire.—Part
      II.

      In the strong city of Demotica, his peculiar domain, the emperor
      John Cantacuzenus was invested with the purple buskins: his right
      leg was clothed by his noble kinsmen, the left by the Latin
      chiefs, on whom he conferred the order of knighthood. But even in
      this act of revolt, he was still studious of loyalty; and the
      titles of John Palæologus and Anne of Savoy were proclaimed
      before his own name and that of his wife Irene. Such vain
      ceremony is a thin disguise of rebellion, nor are there perhaps
      any personal wrongs that can authorize a subject to take arms
      against his sovereign: but the want of preparation and success
      may confirm the assurance of the usurper, that this decisive step
      was the effect of necessity rather than of choice. Constantinople
      adhered to the young emperor; the king of Bulgaria was invited to
      the relief of Adrianople: the principal cities of Thrace and
      Macedonia, after some hesitation, renounced their obedience to
      the great domestic; and the leaders of the troops and provinces
      were induced, by their private interest, to prefer the loose
      dominion of a woman and a priest. 271 The army of Cantacuzene, in
      sixteen divisions, was stationed on the banks of the Melas to
      tempt or to intimidate the capital: it was dispersed by treachery
      or fear; and the officers, more especially the mercenary Latins,
      accepted the bribes, and embraced the service, of the Byzantine
      court. After this loss, the rebel emperor (he fluctuated between
      the two characters) took the road of Thessalonica with a chosen
      remnant; but he failed in his enterprise on that important place;
      and he was closely pursued by the great duke, his enemy
      Apocaucus, at the head of a superior power by sea and land.
      Driven from the coast, in his march, or rather flight, into the
      mountains of Servia, Cantacuzene assembled his troops to
      scrutinize those who were worthy and willing to accompany his
      broken fortunes. A base majority bowed and retired; and his
      trusty band was diminished to two thousand, and at last to five
      hundred, volunteers. The _cral_, 28 or despot of the Servians
      received him with general hospitality; but the ally was
      insensibly degraded to a suppliant, a hostage, a captive; and in
      this miserable dependence, he waited at the door of the
      Barbarian, who could dispose of the life and liberty of a Roman
      emperor. The most tempting offers could not persuade the cral to
      violate his trust; but he soon inclined to the stronger side; and
      his friend was dismissed without injury to a new vicissitude of
      hopes and perils. Near six years the flame of discord burnt with
      various success and unabated rage: the cities were distracted by
      the faction of the nobles and the plebeians; the Cantacuzeni and
      Palæologi: and the Bulgarians, the Servians, and the Turks, were
      invoked on both sides as the instruments of private ambition and
      the common ruin. The regent deplored the calamities, of which he
      was the author and victim: and his own experience might dictate a
      just and lively remark on the different nature of foreign and
      civil war. “The former,” said he, “is the external warmth of
      summer, always tolerable, and often beneficial; the latter is the
      deadly heat of a fever, which consumes without a remedy the
      vitals of the constitution.” 29

      271 (return) [ Cantacuzene asserts, that in all the cities, the
      populace were on the side of the emperor, the aristocracy on his.
      The populace took the opportunity of rising and plundering the
      wealthy as Cantacuzenites, vol. iii. c. 29 Ages of common
      oppression and ruin had not extinguished these republican
      factions.—M.]

      28 (return) [ The princes of Servia (Ducange, Famil. Dalmaticæ,
      &c., c. 2, 3, 4, 9) were styled Despots in Greek, and Cral in
      their native idiom, (Ducange, Gloss. Græc. p. 751.) That title,
      the equivalent of king, appears to be of Sclavonic origin, from
      whence it has been borrowed by the Hungarians, the modern Greeks,
      and even by the Turks, (Leunclavius, Pandect. Turc. p. 422,) who
      reserve the name of Padishah for the emperor. To obtain the
      latter instead of the former is the ambition of the French at
      Constantinople, (Aversissement à l’Histoire de Timur Bec, p.
      39.)]

      29 (return) [ Nic. Gregoras, l. xii. c. 14. It is surprising that
      Cantacuzene has not inserted this just and lively image in his
      own writings.]

      The introduction of barbarians and savages into the contests of
      civilized nations, is a measure pregnant with shame and mischief;
      which the interest of the moment may compel, but which is
      reprobated by the best principles of humanity and reason. It is
      the practice of both sides to accuse their enemies of the guilt
      of the first alliances; and those who fail in their negotiations
      are loudest in their censure of the example which they envy and
      would gladly imitate. The Turks of Asia were less barbarous
      perhaps than the shepherds of Bulgaria and Servia; but their
      religion rendered them implacable foes of Rome and Christianity.
      To acquire the friendship of their emirs, the two factions vied
      with each other in baseness and profusion: the dexterity of
      Cantacuzene obtained the preference: but the succor and victory
      were dearly purchased by the marriage of his daughter with an
      infidel, the captivity of many thousand Christians, and the
      passage of the Ottomans into Europe, the last and fatal stroke in
      the fall of the Roman empire. The inclining scale was decided in
      his favor by the death of Apocaucus, the just though singular
      retribution of his crimes. A crowd of nobles or plebeians, whom
      he feared or hated, had been seized by his orders in the capital
      and the provinces; and the old palace of Constantine was assigned
      as the place of their confinement. Some alterations in raising
      the walls, and narrowing the cells, had been ingeniously
      contrived to prevent their escape, and aggravate their misery;
      and the work was incessantly pressed by the daily visits of the
      tyrant. His guards watched at the gate, and as he stood in the
      inner court to overlook the architects, without fear or
      suspicion, he was assaulted and laid breathless on the ground, by
      two 291 resolute prisoners of the Palæologian race, 30 who were
      armed with sticks, and animated by despair. On the rumor of
      revenge and liberty, the captive multitude broke their fetters,
      fortified their prison, and exposed from the battlements the
      tyrant’s head, presuming on the favor of the people and the
      clemency of the empress. Anne of Savoy might rejoice in the fall
      of a haughty and ambitious minister, but while she delayed to
      resolve or to act, the populace, more especially the mariners,
      were excited by the widow of the great duke to a sedition, an
      assault, and a massacre. The prisoners (of whom the far greater
      part were guiltless or inglorious of the deed) escaped to a
      neighboring church: they were slaughtered at the foot of the
      altar; and in his death the monster was not less bloody and
      venomous than in his life. Yet his talents alone upheld the cause
      of the young emperor; and his surviving associates, suspicious of
      each other, abandoned the conduct of the war, and rejected the
      fairest terms of accommodation. In the beginning of the dispute,
      the empress felt, and complained, that she was deceived by the
      enemies of Cantacuzene: the patriarch was employed to preach
      against the forgiveness of injuries; and her promise of immortal
      hatred was sealed by an oath, under the penalty of
      excommunication. 31 But Anne soon learned to hate without a
      teacher: she beheld the misfortunes of the empire with the
      indifference of a stranger: her jealousy was exasperated by the
      competition of a rival empress; and on the first symptoms of a
      more yielding temper, she threatened the patriarch to convene a
      synod, and degrade him from his office. Their incapacity and
      discord would have afforded the most decisive advantage; but the
      civil war was protracted by the weakness of both parties; and the
      moderation of Cantacuzene has not escaped the reproach of
      timidity and indolence. He successively recovered the provinces
      and cities; and the realm of his pupil was measured by the walls
      of Constantinople; but the metropolis alone counterbalanced the
      rest of the empire; nor could he attempt that important conquest
      till he had secured in his favor the public voice and a private
      correspondence. An Italian, of the name of Facciolati, 32 had
      succeeded to the office of great duke: the ships, the guards, and
      the golden gate, were subject to his command; but his humble
      ambition was bribed to become the instrument of treachery; and
      the revolution was accomplished without danger or bloodshed.
      Destitute of the powers of resistance, or the hope of relief, the
      inflexible Anne would have still defended the palace, and have
      smiled to behold the capital in flames, rather than in the
      possession of a rival. She yielded to the prayers of her friends
      and enemies; and the treaty was dictated by the conqueror, who
      professed a loyal and zealous attachment to the son of his
      benefactor. The marriage of his daughter with John Palæologus was
      at length consummated: the hereditary right of the pupil was
      acknowledged; but the sole administration during ten years was
      vested in the guardian. Two emperors and three empresses were
      seated on the Byzantine throne; and a general amnesty quieted the
      apprehensions, and confirmed the property, of the most guilty
      subjects. The festival of the coronation and nuptials was
      celebrated with the appearances of concord and magnificence, and
      both were equally fallacious. During the late troubles, the
      treasures of the state, and even the furniture of the palace, had
      been alienated or embezzled; the royal banquet was served in
      pewter or earthenware; and such was the proud poverty of the
      times, that the absence of gold and jewels was supplied by the
      paltry artifices of glass and gilt-leather. 33

      I hasten to conclude the personal history of John Cantacuzene. 34
      He triumphed and reigned; but his reign and triumph were clouded
      by the discontent of his own and the adverse faction. His
      followers might style the general amnesty an act of pardon for
      his enemies, and of oblivion for his friends: 35 in his cause
      their estates had been forfeited or plundered; and as they
      wandered naked and hungry through the streets, they cursed the
      selfish generosity of a leader, who, on the throne of the empire,
      might relinquish without merit his private inheritance. The
      adherents of the empress blushed to hold their lives and fortunes
      by the precarious favor of a usurper; and the thirst of revenge
      was concealed by a tender concern for the succession, and even
      the safety, of her son. They were justly alarmed by a petition of
      the friends of Cantacuzene, that they might be released from
      their oath of allegiance to the Palæologi, and intrusted with the
      defence of some cautionary towns; a measure supported with
      argument and eloquence; and which was rejected (says the Imperial
      historian) “by _my_ sublime, and almost incredible virtue.” His
      repose was disturbed by the sound of plots and seditions; and he
      trembled lest the lawful prince should be stolen away by some
      foreign or domestic enemy, who would inscribe his name and his
      wrongs in the banners of rebellion. As the son of Andronicus
      advanced in the years of manhood, he began to feel and to act for
      himself; and his rising ambition was rather stimulated than
      checked by the imitation of his father’s vices. If we may trust
      his own professions, Cantacuzene labored with honest industry to
      correct these sordid and sensual appetites, and to raise the mind
      of the young prince to a level with his fortune. In the Servian
      expedition, the two emperors showed themselves in cordial harmony
      to the troops and provinces; and the younger colleague was
      initiated by the elder in the mysteries of war and government.
      After the conclusion of the peace, Palæologus was left at
      Thessalonica, a royal residence, and a frontier station, to
      secure by his absence the peace of Constantinople, and to
      withdraw his youth from the temptations of a luxurious capital.
      But the distance weakened the powers of control, and the son of
      Andronicus was surrounded with artful or unthinking companions,
      who taught him to hate his guardian, to deplore his exile, and to
      vindicate his rights. A private treaty with the cral or despot of
      Servia was soon followed by an open revolt; and Cantacuzene, on
      the throne of the elder Andronicus, defended the cause of age and
      prerogative, which in his youth he had so vigorously attacked. At
      his request the empress-mother undertook the voyage of
      Thessalonica, and the office of mediation: she returned without
      success; and unless Anne of Savoy was instructed by adversity, we
      may doubt the sincerity, or at least the fervor, of her zeal.
      While the regent grasped the sceptre with a firm and vigorous
      hand, she had been instructed to declare, that the ten years of
      his legal administration would soon elapse; and that, after a
      full trial of the vanity of the world, the emperor Cantacuzene
      sighed for the repose of a cloister, and was ambitious only of a
      heavenly crown. Had these sentiments been genuine, his voluntary
      abdication would have restored the peace of the empire, and his
      conscience would have been relieved by an act of justice.
      Palæologus alone was responsible for his future government; and
      whatever might be his vices, they were surely less formidable
      than the calamities of a civil war, in which the Barbarians and
      infidels were again invited to assist the Greeks in their mutual
      destruction. By the arms of the Turks, who now struck a deep and
      everlasting root in Europe, Cantacuzene prevailed in the third
      contest in which he had been involved; and the young emperor,
      driven from the sea and land, was compelled to take shelter among
      the Latins of the Isle of Tenedos. His insolence and obstinacy
      provoked the victor to a step which must render the quarrel
      irreconcilable; and the association of his son Matthew, whom he
      invested with the purple, established the succession in the
      family of the Cantacuzeni. But Constantinople was still attached
      to the blood of her ancient princes; and this last injury
      accelerated the restoration of the rightful heir. A noble Genoese
      espoused the cause of Palæologus, obtained a promise of his
      sister, and achieved the revolution with two galleys and two
      thousand five hundred auxiliaries. Under the pretence of
      distress, they were admitted into the lesser port; a gate was
      opened, and the Latin shout of, “Long life and victory to the
      emperor, John Palæologus!” was answered by a general rising in
      his favor. A numerous and loyal party yet adhered to the standard
      of Cantacuzene: but he asserts in his history (does he hope for
      belief?) that his tender conscience rejected the assurance of
      conquest; that, in free obedience to the voice of religion and
      philosophy, he descended from the throne and embraced with
      pleasure the monastic habit and profession. 36 So soon as he
      ceased to be a prince, his successor was not unwilling that he
      should be a saint: the remainder of his life was devoted to piety
      and learning; in the cells of Constantinople and Mount Athos, the
      monk Joasaph was respected as the temporal and spiritual father
      of the emperor; and if he issued from his retreat, it was as the
      minister of peace, to subdue the obstinacy, and solicit the
      pardon, of his rebellious son. 37

      34 (return) [ From his return to Constantinople, Cantacuzene
      continues his history and that of the empire, one year beyond the
      abdication of his son Matthew, A.D. 1357, (l. iv. c. l—50, p.
      705—911.) Nicephorus Gregoras ends with the synod of
      Constantinople, in the year 1351, (l. xxii. c. 3, p. 660; the
      rest, to the conclusion of the xxivth book, p. 717, is all
      controversy;) and his fourteen last books are still MSS. in the
      king of France’s library.]

      of his friends, who suffered by its effects. I have lent them the
      words of our poor cavaliers after the Restoration.]

      36 (return) [ The awkward apology of Cantacuzene, (l. iv. c.
      39—42,) who relates, with visible confusion, his own downfall,
      may be supplied by the less accurate, but more honest, narratives
      of Matthew Villani (l. iv. c. 46, in the Script. Rerum Ital. tom.
      xiv. p. 268) and Ducas, (c 10, 11.)]

      37 (return) [ Cantacuzene, in the year 1375, was honored with a
      letter from the pope, (Fleury, Hist. Ecclés. tom. xx. p. 250.)
      His death is placed by a respectable authority on the 20th of
      November, 1411, (Ducange, Fam. Byzant. p. 260.) But if he were of
      the age of his companion Andronicus the Younger, he must have
      lived 116 years; a rare instance of longevity, which in so
      illustrious a person would have attracted universal notice.]

      Yet in the cloister, the mind of Cantacuzene was still exercised
      by theological war. He sharpened a controversial pen against the
      Jews and Mahometans; 38 and in every state he defended with equal
      zeal the divine light of Mount Thabor, a memorable question which
      consummates the religious follies of the Greeks. The fakirs of
      India, 39 and the monks of the Oriental church, were alike
      persuaded, that in the total abstraction of the faculties of the
      mind and body, the purer spirit may ascend to the enjoyment and
      vision of the Deity. The opinion and practice of the monasteries
      of Mount Athos 40 will be best represented in the words of an
      abbot, who flourished in the eleventh century. “When thou art
      alone in thy cell,” says the ascetic teacher, “shut thy door, and
      seat thyself in a corner: raise thy mind above all things vain
      and transitory; recline thy beard and chin on thy breast; turn
      thy eyes and thy thoughts toward the middle of thy belly, the
      region of the navel; and search the place of the heart, the seat
      of the soul. At first, all will be dark and comfortless; but if
      you persevere day and night, you will feel an ineffable joy; and
      no sooner has the soul discovered the place of the heart, than it
      is involved in a mystic and ethereal light.” This light, the
      production of a distempered fancy, the creature of an empty
      stomach and an empty brain, was adored by the Quietists as the
      pure and perfect essence of God himself; and as long as the folly
      was confined to Mount Athos, the simple solitaries were not
      inquisitive how the divine essence could be a _material_
      substance, or how an _immaterial_ substance could be perceived by
      the eyes of the body. But in the reign of the younger Andronicus,
      these monasteries were visited by Barlaam, 41 a Calabrian monk,
      who was equally skilled in philosophy and theology; who possessed
      the language of the Greeks and Latins; and whose versatile genius
      could maintain their opposite creeds, according to the interest
      of the moment. The indiscretion of an ascetic revealed to the
      curious traveller the secrets of mental prayer and Barlaam
      embraced the opportunity of ridiculing the Quietists, who placed
      the soul in the navel; of accusing the monks of Mount Athos of
      heresy and blasphemy. His attack compelled the more learned to
      renounce or dissemble the simple devotion of their brethren; and
      Gregory Palamas introduced a scholastic distinction between the
      essence and operation of God. His inaccessible essence dwells in
      the midst of an uncreated and eternal light; and this beatific
      vision of the saints had been manifested to the disciples on
      Mount Thabor, in the transfiguration of Christ. Yet this
      distinction could not escape the reproach of polytheism; the
      eternity of the light of Thabor was fiercely denied; and Barlaam
      still charged the Palamites with holding two eternal substances,
      a visible and an invisible God. From the rage of the monks of
      Mount Athos, who threatened his life, the Calabrian retired to
      Constantinople, where his smooth and specious manners introduced
      him to the favor of the great domestic and the emperor. The court
      and the city were involved in this theological dispute, which
      flamed amidst the civil war; but the doctrine of Barlaam was
      disgraced by his flight and apostasy: the Palamites triumphed;
      and their adversary, the patriarch John of Apri, was deposed by
      the consent of the adverse factions of the state. In the
      character of emperor and theologian, Cantacuzene presided in the
      synod of the Greek church, which established, as an article of
      faith, the uncreated light of Mount Thabor; and, after so many
      insults, the reason of mankind was slightly wounded by the
      addition of a single absurdity. Many rolls of paper or parchment
      have been blotted; and the impenitent sectaries, who refused to
      subscribe the orthodox creed, were deprived of the honors of
      Christian burial; but in the next age the question was forgotten;
      nor can I learn that the axe or the fagot were employed for the
      extirpation of the Barlaamite heresy. 42

      his friends of Ispahan. Cantacuzene had read the Koran; but I
      understand from Maracci that he adopts the vulgar prejudices and
      fables against Mahomet and his religion.]

      the Coislin library, have added some facts and documents.]

      For the conclusion of this chapter, I have reserved the Genoese
      war, which shook the throne of Cantacuzene, and betrayed the
      debility of the Greek empire. The Genoese, who, after the
      recovery of Constantinople, were seated in the suburb of Pera or
      Galata, received that honorable fief from the bounty of the
      emperor. They were indulged in the use of their laws and
      magistrates; but they submitted to the duties of vassals and
      subjects; the forcible word of _liegemen_43 was borrowed from the
      Latin jurisprudence; and their _podesta_, or chief, before he
      entered on his office, saluted the emperor with loyal
      acclamations and vows of fidelity. Genoa sealed a firm alliance
      with the Greeks; and, in case of a defensive war, a supply of
      fifty empty galleys and a succor of fifty galleys, completely
      armed and manned, was promised by the republic to the empire. In
      the revival of a naval force, it was the aim of Michael
      Palæologus to deliver himself from a foreign aid; and his
      vigorous government contained the Genoese of Galata within those
      limits which the insolence of wealth and freedom provoked them to
      exceed. A sailor threatened that they should soon be masters of
      Constantinople, and slew the Greek who resented this national
      affront; and an armed vessel, after refusing to salute the
      palace, was guilty of some acts of piracy in the Black Sea. Their
      countrymen threatened to support their cause; but the long and
      open village of Galata was instantly surrounded by the Imperial
      troops; till, in the moment of the assault, the prostrate Genoese
      implored the clemency of their sovereign. The defenceless
      situation which secured their obedience exposed them to the
      attack of their Venetian rivals, who, in the reign of the elder
      Andronicus, presumed to violate the majesty of the throne. On the
      approach of their fleets, the Genoese, with their families and
      effects, retired into the city: their empty habitations were
      reduced to ashes; and the feeble prince, who had viewed the
      destruction of his suburb, expressed his resentment, not by arms,
      but by ambassadors. This misfortune, however, was advantageous to
      the Genoese, who obtained, and imperceptibly abused, the
      dangerous license of surrounding Galata with a strong wall; of
      introducing into the ditch the waters of the sea; of erecting
      lofty turrets; and of mounting a train of military engines on the
      rampart. The narrow bounds in which they had been circumscribed
      were insufficient for the growing colony; each day they acquired
      some addition of landed property; and the adjacent hills were
      covered with their villas and castles, which they joined and
      protected by new fortifications. 44 The navigation and trade of
      the Euxine was the patrimony of the Greek emperors, who commanded
      the narrow entrance, the gates, as it were, of that inland sea.
      In the reign of Michael Palæologus, their prerogative was
      acknowledged by the sultan of Egypt, who solicited and obtained
      the liberty of sending an annual ship for the purchase of slaves
      in Circassia and the Lesser Tartary: a liberty pregnant with
      mischief to the Christian cause; since these youths were
      transformed by education and discipline into the formidable
      Mamalukes. 45 From the colony of Pera, the Genoese engaged with
      superior advantage in the lucrative trade of the Black Sea; and
      their industry supplied the Greeks with fish and corn; two
      articles of food almost equally important to a superstitious
      people. The spontaneous bounty of nature appears to have bestowed
      the harvests of Ukraine, the produce of a rude and savage
      husbandry; and the endless exportation of salt fish and caviare
      is annually renewed by the enormous sturgeons that are caught at
      the mouth of the Don or Tanais, in their last station of the rich
      mud and shallow water of the Mæotis. 46 The waters of the Oxus,
      the Caspian, the Volga, and the Don, opened a rare and laborious
      passage for the gems and spices of India; and after three months’
      march the caravans of Carizme met the Italian vessels in the
      harbors of Crimæa. 47 These various branches of trade were
      monopolized by the diligence and power of the Genoese. Their
      rivals of Venice and Pisa were forcibly expelled; the natives
      were awed by the castles and cities, which arose on the
      foundations of their humble factories; and their principal
      establishment of Caffa 48 was besieged without effect by the
      Tartar powers. Destitute of a navy, the Greeks were oppressed by
      these haughty merchants, who fed, or famished, Constantinople,
      according to their interest. They proceeded to usurp the customs,
      the fishery, and even the toll, of the Bosphorus; and while they
      derived from these objects a revenue of two hundred thousand
      pieces of gold, a remnant of thirty thousand was reluctantly
      allowed to the emperor. 49 The colony of Pera or Galata acted, in
      peace and war, as an independent state; and, as it will happen in
      distant settlements, the Genoese podesta too often forgot that he
      was the servant of his own masters.

      49 (return) [ See Nic. Gregoras, l. xvii. c. 1.]

      These usurpations were encouraged by the weakness of the elder
      Andronicus, and by the civil wars that afflicted his age and the
      minority of his grandson. The talents of Cantacuzene were
      employed to the ruin, rather than the restoration, of the empire;
      and after his domestic victory, he was condemned to an
      ignominious trial, whether the Greeks or the Genoese should reign
      in Constantinople. The merchants of Pera were offended by his
      refusal of some contiguous land, some commanding heights, which
      they proposed to cover with new fortifications; and in the
      absence of the emperor, who was detained at Demotica by sickness,
      they ventured to brave the debility of a female reign. A
      Byzantine vessel, which had presumed to fish at the mouth of the
      harbor, was sunk by these audacious strangers; the fishermen were
      murdered. Instead of suing for pardon, the Genoese demanded
      satisfaction; required, in a haughty strain, that the Greeks
      should renounce the exercise of navigation; and encountered with
      regular arms the first sallies of the popular indignation. They
      instantly occupied the debatable land; and by the labor of a
      whole people, of either sex and of every age, the wall was
      raised, and the ditch was sunk, with incredible speed. At the
      same time, they attacked and burnt two Byzantine galleys; while
      the three others, the remainder of the Imperial navy, escaped
      from their hands: the habitations without the gates, or along the
      shore, were pillaged and destroyed; and the care of the regent,
      of the empress Irene, was confined to the preservation of the
      city. The return of Cantacuzene dispelled the public
      consternation: the emperor inclined to peaceful counsels; but he
      yielded to the obstinacy of his enemies, who rejected all
      reasonable terms, and to the ardor of his subjects, who
      threatened, in the style of Scripture, to break them in pieces
      like a potter’s vessel. Yet they reluctantly paid the taxes, that
      he imposed for the construction of ships, and the expenses of the
      war; and as the two nations were masters, the one of the land,
      the other of the sea, Constantinople and Pera were pressed by the
      evils of a mutual siege. The merchants of the colony, who had
      believed that a few days would terminate the war, already
      murmured at their losses: the succors from their mother-country
      were delayed by the factions of Genoa; and the most cautious
      embraced the opportunity of a Rhodian vessel to remove their
      families and effects from the scene of hostility. In the spring,
      the Byzantine fleet, seven galleys and a train of smaller
      vessels, issued from the mouth of the harbor, and steered in a
      single line along the shore of Pera; unskilfully presenting their
      sides to the beaks of the adverse squadron. The crews were
      composed of peasants and mechanics; nor was their ignorance
      compensated by the native courage of Barbarians: the wind was
      strong, the waves were rough; and no sooner did the Greeks
      perceive a distant and inactive enemy, than they leaped headlong
      into the sea, from a doubtful, to an inevitable peril. The troops
      that marched to the attack of the lines of Pera were struck at
      the same moment with a similar panic; and the Genoese were
      astonished, and almost ashamed, at their double victory. Their
      triumphant vessels, crowned with flowers, and dragging after them
      the captive galleys, repeatedly passed and repassed before the
      palace: the only virtue of the emperor was patience; and the hope
      of revenge his sole consolation. Yet the distress of both parties
      interposed a temporary agreement; and the shame of the empire was
      disguised by a thin veil of dignity and power. Summoning the
      chiefs of the colony, Cantacuzene affected to despise the trivial
      object of the debate; and, after a mild reproof, most liberally
      granted the lands, which had been previously resigned to the
      seeming custody of his officers. 50

      50 (return) [ The events of this war are related by Cantacuzene
      (l. iv. c. 11 with obscurity and confusion, and by Nic. Gregoras
      l. xvii. c. 1—7) in a clear and honest narrative. The priest was
      less responsible than the prince for the defeat of the fleet.]

      But the emperor was soon solicited to violate the treaty, and to
      join his arms with the Venetians, the perpetual enemies of Genoa
      and her colonies. While he compared the reasons of peace and war,
      his moderation was provoked by a wanton insult of the inhabitants
      of Pera, who discharged from their rampart a large stone that
      fell in the midst of Constantinople. On his just complaint, they
      coldly blamed the imprudence of their engineer; but the next day
      the insult was repeated; and they exulted in a second proof that
      the royal city was not beyond the reach of their artillery.
      Cantacuzene instantly signed his treaty with the Venetians; but
      the weight of the Roman empire was scarcely felt in the balance
      of these opulent and powerful republics. 51 From the Straits of
      Gibraltar to the mouth of the Tanais, their fleets encountered
      each other with various success; and a memorable battle was
      fought in the narrow sea, under the walls of Constantinople. It
      would not be an easy task to reconcile the accounts of the
      Greeks, the Venetians, and the Genoese; 52 and while I depend on
      the narrative of an impartial historian, 53 I shall borrow from
      each nation the facts that redound to their own disgrace, and the
      honor of their foes. The Venetians, with their allies the
      Catalans, had the advantage of number; and their fleet, with the
      poor addition of eight Byzantine galleys, amounted to
      seventy-five sail: the Genoese did not exceed sixty-four; but in
      those times their ships of war were distinguished by the
      superiority of their size and strength. The names and families of
      their naval commanders, Pisani and Doria, are illustrious in the
      annals of their country; but the personal merit of the former was
      eclipsed by the fame and abilities of his rival. They engaged in
      tempestuous weather; and the tumultuary conflict was continued
      from the dawn to the extinction of light. The enemies of the
      Genoese applaud their prowess; the friends of the Venetians are
      dissatisfied with their behavior; but all parties agree in
      praising the skill and boldness of the Catalans, 531 who, with
      many wounds, sustained the brunt of the action. On the separation
      of the fleets, the event might appear doubtful; but the thirteen
      Genoese galleys, that had been sunk or taken, were compensated by
      a double loss of the allies; of fourteen Venetians, ten Catalans,
      and two Greeks; 532 and even the grief of the conquerors
      expressed the assurance and habit of more decisive victories.
      Pisani confessed his defeat, by retiring into a fortified harbor,
      from whence, under the pretext of the orders of the senate, he
      steered with a broken and flying squadron for the Isle of Candia,
      and abandoned to his rivals the sovereignty of the sea. In a
      public epistle, 54 addressed to the doge and senate, Petrarch
      employs his eloquence to reconcile the maritime powers, the two
      luminaries of Italy. The orator celebrates the valor and victory
      of the Genoese, the first of men in the exercise of naval war: he
      drops a tear on the misfortunes of their Venetian brethren; but
      he exhorts them to pursue with fire and sword the base and
      perfidious Greeks; to purge the metropolis of the East from the
      heresy with which it was infected. Deserted by their friends, the
      Greeks were incapable of resistance; and three months after the
      battle, the emperor Cantacuzene solicited and subscribed a
      treaty, which forever banished the Venetians and Catalans, and
      granted to the Genoese a monopoly of trade, and almost a right of
      dominion. The Roman empire (I smile in transcribing the name)
      might soon have sunk into a province of Genoa, if the ambition of
      the republic had not been checked by the ruin of her freedom and
      naval power. A long contest of one hundred and thirty years was
      determined by the triumph of Venice; and the factions of the
      Genoese compelled them to seek for domestic peace under the
      protection of a foreign lord, the duke of Milan, or the French
      king. Yet the spirit of commerce survived that of conquest; and
      the colony of Pera still awed the capital and navigated the
      Euxine, till it was involved by the Turks in the final servitude
      of Constantinople itself.

      51 (return) [ The second war is darkly told by Cantacuzene, (l.
      iv. c. 18, p. 24, 25, 28—32,) who wishes to disguise what he
      dares not deny. I regret this part of Nic. Gregoras, which is
      still in MS. at Paris. * Note: This part of Nicephorus Gregoras
      has not been printed in the new edition of the Byzantine
      Historians. The editor expresses a hope that it may be undertaken
      by Hase. I should join in the regret of Gibbon, if these books
      contain any historical information: if they are but a
      continuation of the controversies which fill the last books in
      our present copies, they may as well sleep their eternal sleep in
      MS. as in print.—M.]

      52 (return) [ Muratori (Annali d’ Italia, tom. xii. p. 144)
      refers to the most ancient Chronicles of Venice (Caresinus, the
      continuator of Andrew Dandulus, tom. xii. p. 421, 422) and Genoa,
      (George Stella Annales Genuenses, tom. xvii. p. 1091, 1092;) both
      which I have diligently consulted in his great Collection of the
      Historians of Italy.]

      53 (return) [ See the Chronicle of Matteo Villani of Florence, l.
      ii. c. 59, p. 145—147, c. 74, 75, p. 156, 157, in Muratori’s
      Collection, tom. xiv.]

      531 (return) [ Cantacuzene praises their bravery, but imputes
      their losses to their ignorance of the seas: they suffered more
      by the breakers than by the enemy, vol. iii. p. 224.—M.]

      532 (return) [ Cantacuzene says that the Genoese lost
      twenty-eight ships with their crews, autandroi; the Venetians and
      Catalans sixteen, the Imperials, none Cantacuzene accuses Pisani
      of cowardice, in not following up the victory, and destroying the
      Genoese. But Pisani’s conduct, and indeed Cantacuzene’s account
      of the battle, betray the superiority of the Genoese.—M.]

      54 (return) [ The Abbé de Sade (Mémoires sur la Vie de Petrarque,
      tom. iii. p. 257—263) translates this letter, which he copied
      from a MS. in the king of France’s library. Though a servant of
      the duke of Milan, Petrarch pours forth his astonishment and
      grief at the defeat and despair of the Genoese in the following
      year, (p. 323—332.)]
