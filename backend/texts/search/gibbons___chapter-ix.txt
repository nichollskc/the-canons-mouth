Chapter IX: State Of Germany Until The Barbarians.—Part I.

     The State Of Germany Till The Invasion Of The Barbarians In The
     Time Of The Emperor Decius.

      The government and religion of Persia have deserved some notice,
      from their connection with the decline and fall of the Roman
      empire. We shall occasionally mention the Scythian or Sarmatian
      tribes, 1001 which, with their arms and horses, their flocks and
      herds, their wives and families, wandered over the immense plains
      which spread themselves from the Caspian Sea to the Vistula, from
      the confines of Persia to those of Germany. But the warlike
      Germans, who first resisted, then invaded, and at length
      overturned the Western monarchy of Rome, will occupy a much more
      important place in this history, and possess a stronger, and, if
      we may use the expression, a more domestic, claim to our
      attention and regard. The most civilized nations of modern Europe
      issued from the woods of Germany; and in the rude institutions of
      those barbarians we may still distinguish the original principles
      of our present laws and manners. In their primitive state of
      simplicity and independence, the Germans were surveyed by the
      discerning eye, and delineated by the masterly pencil, of
      Tacitus, 1002 the first of historians who applied the science of
      philosophy to the study of facts. The expressive conciseness of
      his descriptions has served to exercise the diligence of
      innumerable antiquarians, and to excite the genius and
      penetration of the philosophic historians of our own times. The
      subject, however various and important, has already been so
      frequently, so ably, and so successfully discussed, that it is
      now grown familiar to the reader, and difficult to the writer. We
      shall therefore content ourselves with observing, and indeed with
      repeating, some of the most important circumstances of climate,
      of manners, and of institutions, which rendered the wild
      barbarians of Germany such formidable enemies to the Roman power.

      1001 (return) [ The Scythians, even according to the ancients,
      are not Sarmatians. It may be doubted whether Gibbon intended to
      confound them.—M. ——The Greeks, after having divided the world
      into Greeks and barbarians. divided the barbarians into four
      great classes, the Celts, the Scythians, the Indians, and the
      Ethiopians. They called Celts all the inhabitants of Gaul.
      Scythia extended from the Baltic Sea to the Lake Aral: the people
      enclosed in the angle to the north-east, between Celtica and
      Scythia, were called Celto-Scythians, and the Sarmatians were
      placed in the southern part of that angle. But these names of
      Celts, of Scythians, of Celto-Scythians, and Sarmatians, were
      invented, says Schlozer, by the profound cosmographical ignorance
      of the Greeks, and have no real ground; they are purely
      geographical divisions, without any relation to the true
      affiliation of the different races. Thus all the inhabitants of
      Gaul are called Celts by most of the ancient writers; yet Gaul
      contained three totally distinct nations, the Belgæ, the
      Aquitani, and the Gauls, properly so called. Hi omnes lingua
      institutis, legibusque inter se differunt. Cæsar. Com. c. i. It
      is thus the Turks call all Europeans Franks. Schlozer, Allgemeine
      Nordische Geschichte, p. 289. 1771. Bayer (de Origine et priscis
      Sedibus Scytharum, in Opusc. p. 64) says, Primus eorum, de quibus
      constat, Ephorus, in quarto historiarum libro, orbem terrarum
      inter Scythas, Indos, Æthiopas et Celtas divisit. Fragmentum ejus
      loci Cosmas Indicopleustes in topographia Christiana, f. 148,
      conservavit. Video igitur Ephorum, cum locorum positus per certa
      capita distribuere et explicare constitueret, insigniorum nomina
      gentium vastioribus spatiis adhibuisse, nulla mala fraude et
      successu infelici. Nam Ephoro quoquomodo dicta pro exploratis
      habebant Græci plerique et Romani: ita gliscebat error
      posteritate. Igitur tot tamque diversæ stirpis gentes non modo
      intra communem quandam regionem definitæ, unum omnes Scytharum
      nomen his auctoribus subierunt, sed etiam ab illa regionis
      adpellatione in eandem nationem sunt conflatæ. Sic Cimmeriorum
      res cum Scythicis, Scytharum cum Sarmaticis, Russicis, Hunnicis,
      Tataricis commiscentur.—G.]

      1002 (return) [ The Germania of Tacitus has been a fruitful
      source of hypothesis to the ingenuity of modern writers, who have
      endeavored to account for the form of the work and the views of
      the author. According to Luden, (Geschichte des T. V. i. 432, and
      note,) it contains the unfinished and disarranged for a larger
      work. An anonymous writer, supposed by Luden to be M. Becker,
      conceives that it was intended as an episode in his larger
      history. According to M. Guizot, “Tacite a peint les Germains
      comme Montaigne et Rousseau les sauvages, dans un acces d’humeur
      contre sa patrie: son livre est une satire des mœurs Romaines,
      l’eloquente boutade d’un patriote philosophe qui veut voir la
      vertu la, ou il ne rencontre pas la mollesse honteuse et la
      depravation savante d’une vielle societe.” Hist. de la
      Civilisation Moderne, i. 258.—M.]

      Ancient Germany, excluding from its independent limits the
      province westward of the Rhine, which had submitted to the Roman
      yoke, extended itself over a third part of Europe. 1 Almost the
      whole of modern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland,
      Livonia, Prussia, and the greater part of Poland, were peopled by
      the various tribes of one great nation, whose complexion,
      manners, and language denoted a common origin, and preserved a
      striking resemblance. On the west, ancient Germany was divided by
      the Rhine from the Gallic, and on the south, by the Danube, from
      the Illyrian, provinces of the empire. A ridge of hills, rising
      from the Danube, and called the Carpathian Mountains, covered
      Germany on the side of Dacia or Hungary. The eastern frontier was
      faintly marked by the mutual fears of the Germans and the
      Sarmatians, and was often confounded by the mixture of warring
      and confederating tribes of the two nations. In the remote
      darkness of the north, the ancients imperfectly descried a frozen
      ocean that lay beyond the Baltic Sea, and beyond the Peninsula,
      or islands 1001a of Scandinavia.

      1 (return) [ Germany was not of such vast extent. It is from
      Cæsar, and more particularly from Ptolemy, (says Gatterer,) that
      we can know what was the state of ancient Germany before the wars
      with the Romans had changed the positions of the tribes. Germany,
      as changed by these wars, has been described by Strabo, Pliny,
      and Tacitus. Germany, properly so called, was bounded on the west
      by the Rhine, on the east by the Vistula, on the north by the
      southern point of Norway, by Sweden, and Esthonia. On the south,
      the Maine and the mountains to the north of Bohemia formed the
      limits. Before the time of Cæsar, the country between the Maine
      and the Danube was partly occupied by the Helvetians and other
      Gauls, partly by the Hercynian forest but, from the time of Cæsar
      to the great migration, these boundaries were advanced as far as
      the Danube, or, what is the same thing, to the Suabian Alps,
      although the Hercynian forest still occupied, from north to
      south, a space of nine days’ journey on both banks of the Danube.
      “Gatterer, Versuch einer all-gemeinen Welt-Geschichte,” p. 424,
      edit. de 1792. This vast country was far from being inhabited by
      a single nation divided into different tribes of the same origin.
      We may reckon three principal races, very distinct in their
      language, their origin, and their customs. 1. To the east, the
      Slaves or Vandals. 2. To the west, the Cimmerians or Cimbri. 3.
      Between the Slaves and Cimbrians, the Germans, properly so
      called, the Suevi of Tacitus. The South was inhabited, before
      Julius Cæsar, by nations of Gaulish origin, afterwards by the
      Suevi.—G. On the position of these nations, the German
      antiquaries differ. I. The Slaves, or Sclavonians, or Wendish
      tribes, according to Schlozer, were originally settled in parts
      of Germany unknown to the Romans, Mecklenburgh, Pomerania,
      Brandenburgh, Upper Saxony; and Lusatia. According to Gatterer,
      they remained to the east of the Theiss, the Niemen, and the
      Vistula, till the third century. The Slaves, according to
      Procopius and Jornandes, formed three great divisions. 1. The
      Venedi or Vandals, who took the latter name, (the Wenden,) having
      expelled the Vandals, properly so called, (a Suevian race, the
      conquerors of Africa,) from the country between the Memel and the
      Vistula. 2. The Antes, who inhabited between the Dneister and the
      Dnieper. 3. The Sclavonians, properly so called, in the north of
      Dacia. During the great migration, these races advanced into
      Germany as far as the Saal and the Elbe. The Sclavonian language
      is the stem from which have issued the Russian, the Polish, the
      Bohemian, and the dialects of Lusatia, of some parts of the duchy
      of Luneburgh, of Carniola, Carinthia, and Styria, &c.; those of
      Croatia, Bosnia, and Bulgaria. Schlozer, Nordische Geschichte, p.
      323, 335. II. The Cimbric race. Adelung calls by this name all
      who were not Suevi. This race had passed the Rhine, before the
      time of Cæsar, occupied Belgium, and are the Belgæ of Cæsar and
      Pliny. The Cimbrians also occupied the Isle of Jutland. The Cymri
      of Wales and of Britain are of this race. Many tribes on the
      right bank of the Rhine, the Guthini in Jutland, the Usipeti in
      Westphalia, the Sigambri in the duchy of Berg, were German
      Cimbrians. III. The Suevi, known in very early times by the
      Romans, for they are mentioned by L. Corn. Sisenna, who lived 123
      years before Christ, (Nonius v. Lancea.) This race, the real
      Germans, extended to the Vistula, and from the Baltic to the
      Hercynian forest. The name of Suevi was sometimes confined to a
      single tribe, as by Cæsar to the Catti. The name of the Suevi has
      been preserved in Suabia. These three were the principal races
      which inhabited Germany; they moved from east to west, and are
      the parent stem of the modern natives. But northern Europe,
      according to Schlozer, was not peopled by them alone; other
      races, of different origin, and speaking different languages,
      have inhabited and left descendants in these countries. The
      German tribes called themselves, from very remote times, by the
      generic name of Teutons, (Teuten, Deutschen,) which Tacitus
      derives from that of one of their gods, Tuisco. It appears more
      probable that it means merely men, people. Many savage nations
      have given themselves no other name. Thus the Laplanders call
      themselves Almag, people; the Samoiedes Nilletz, Nissetsch, men,
      &c. As to the name of Germans, (Germani,) Cæsar found it in use
      in Gaul, and adopted it as a word already known to the Romans.
      Many of the learned (from a passage of Tacitus, de Mor Germ. c.
      2) have supposed that it was only applied to the Teutons after
      Cæsar’s time; but Adelung has triumphantly refuted this opinion.
      The name of Germans is found in the Fasti Capitolini. See Gruter,
      Iscrip. 2899, in which the consul Marcellus, in the year of Rome
      531, is said to have defeated the Gauls, the Insubrians, and the
      Germans, commanded by Virdomar. See Adelung, Ælt. Geschichte der
      Deutsch, p. 102.—Compressed from G.]

      1001a (return) [ The modern philosophers of Sweden seem agreed
      that the waters of the Baltic gradually sink in a regular
      proportion, which they have ventured to estimate at half an inch
      every year. Twenty centuries ago the flat country of Scandinavia
      must have been covered by the sea; while the high lands rose
      above the waters, as so many islands of various forms and
      dimensions. Such, indeed, is the notion given us by Mela, Pliny,
      and Tacitus, of the vast countries round the Baltic. See in the
      Bibliotheque Raisonnee, tom. xl. and xlv. a large abstract of
      Dalin’s History of Sweden, composed in the Swedish language. *
      Note: Modern geologists have rejected this theory of the
      depression of the Baltic, as inconsistent with recent
      observation. The considerable changes which have taken place on
      its shores, Mr. Lyell, from actual observation now decidedly
      attributes to the regular and uniform elevation of the
      land.—Lyell’s Geology, b. ii. c. 17—M.]

      Some ingenious writers 2 have suspected that Europe was much
      colder formerly than it is at present; and the most ancient
      descriptions of the climate of Germany tend exceedingly to
      confirm their theory. The general complaints of intense frost and
      eternal winter are perhaps little to be regarded, since we have
      no method of reducing to the accurate standard of the
      thermometer, the feelings, or the expressions, of an orator born
      in the happier regions of Greece or Asia. But I shall select two
      remarkable circumstances of a less equivocal nature. 1. The great
      rivers which covered the Roman provinces, the Rhine and the
      Danube, were frequently frozen over, and capable of supporting
      the most enormous weights. The barbarians, who often chose that
      severe season for their inroads, transported, without
      apprehension or danger, their numerous armies, their cavalry, and
      their heavy wagons, over a vast and solid bridge of ice. 3 Modern
      ages have not presented an instance of a like phenomenon. 2. The
      reindeer, that useful animal, from whom the savage of the North
      derives the best comforts of his dreary life, is of a
      constitution that supports, and even requires, the most intense
      cold. He is found on the rock of Spitzberg, within ten degrees of
      the Pole; he seems to delight in the snows of Lapland and
      Siberia: but at present he cannot subsist, much less multiply, in
      any country to the south of the Baltic. 4 In the time of Cæsar
      the reindeer, as well as the elk and the wild bull, was a native
      of the Hercynian forest, which then overshadowed a great part of
      Germany and Poland. 5 The modern improvements sufficiently
      explain the causes of the diminution of the cold. These immense
      woods have been gradually cleared, which intercepted from the
      earth the rays of the sun. 6 The morasses have been drained, and,
      in proportion as the soil has been cultivated, the air has become
      more temperate. Canada, at this day, is an exact picture of
      ancient Germany. Although situated in the same parallel with the
      finest provinces of France and England, that country experiences
      the most rigorous cold. The reindeer are very numerous, the
      ground is covered with deep and lasting snow, and the great river
      of St. Lawrence is regularly frozen, in a season when the waters
      of the Seine and the Thames are usually free from ice. 7

      Hutchinson. Note: The Danube is constantly frozen over. At Pesth
      the bridge is usually taken up, and the traffic and communication
      between the two banks carried on over the ice. The Rhine is
      likewise in many parts passable at least two years out of five.
      Winter campaigns are so unusual, in modern warfare, that I
      recollect but one instance of an army crossing either river on
      the ice. In the thirty years’ war, (1635,) Jan van Werth, an
      Imperialist partisan, crossed the Rhine from Heidelberg on the
      ice with 5000 men, and surprised Spiers. Pichegru’s memorable
      campaign, (1794-5,) when the freezing of the Meuse and Waal
      opened Holland to his conquests, and his cavalry and artillery
      attacked the ships frozen in, on the Zuyder Zee, was in a winter
      of unprecedented severity.—M. 1845.]

      It is difficult to ascertain, and easy to exaggerate, the
      influence of the climate of ancient Germany over the minds and
      bodies of the natives. Many writers have supposed, and most have
      allowed, though, as it should seem, without any adequate proof,
      that the rigorous cold of the North was favorable to long life
      and generative vigor, that the women were more fruitful, and the
      human species more prolific, than in warmer or more temperate
      climates. 8 We may assert, with greater confidence, that the keen
      air of Germany formed the large and masculine limbs of the
      natives, who were, in general, of a more lofty stature than the
      people of the South, 9 gave them a kind of strength better
      adapted to violent exertions than to patient labor, and inspired
      them with constitutional bravery, which is the result of nerves
      and spirits. The severity of a winter campaign, that chilled the
      courage of the Roman troops, was scarcely felt by these hardy
      children of the North, 10 who, in their turn, were unable to
      resist the summer heats, and dissolved away in languor and
      sickness under the beams of an Italian sun. 11

      Chapter IX: State Of Germany Until The Barbarians.—Part II.

      There is not anywhere upon the globe a large tract of country,
      which we have discovered destitute of inhabitants, or whose first
      population can be fixed with any degree of historical certainty.
      And yet, as the most philosophic minds can seldom refrain from
      investigating the infancy of great nations, our curiosity
      consumes itself in toilsome and disappointed efforts. When
      Tacitus considered the purity of the German blood, and the
      forbidding aspect of the country, he was disposed to pronounce
      those barbarians _Indigenæ_, or natives of the soil. We may allow
      with safety, and perhaps with truth, that ancient Germany was not
      originally peopled by any foreign colonies already formed into a
      political society; 12 but that the name and nation received their
      existence from the gradual union of some wandering savages of the
      Hercynian woods. To assert those savages to have been the
      spontaneous production of the earth which they inhabited would be
      a rash inference, condemned by religion, and unwarranted by
      reason.

      12 (return) [ Facit. Germ. c. 3. The emigration of the Gauls
      followed the course of the Danube, and discharged itself on
      Greece and Asia. Tacitus could discover only one inconsiderable
      tribe that retained any traces of a Gallic origin. * Note: The
      Gothini, who must not be confounded with the Gothi, a Suevian
      tribe. In the time of Cæsar many other tribes of Gaulish origin
      dwelt along the course of the Danube, who could not long resist
      the attacks of the Suevi. The Helvetians, who dwelt on the
      borders of the Black Forest, between the Maine and the Danube,
      had been expelled long before the time of Cæsar. He mentions also
      the Volci Tectosagi, who came from Languedoc and settled round
      the Black Forest. The Boii, who had penetrated into that forest,
      and also have left traces of their name in Bohemia, were subdued
      in the first century by the Marcomanni. The Boii settled in
      Noricum, were mingled afterwards with the Lombards, and received
      the name of Boio Arii (Bavaria) or Boiovarii: var, in some German
      dialects, appearing to mean remains, descendants. Compare Malte
      B-m, Geography, vol. i. p. 410, edit 1832—M.]

      Such rational doubt is but ill suited with the genius of popular
      vanity. Among the nations who have adopted the Mosaic history of
      the world, the ark of Noah has been of the same use, as was
      formerly to the Greeks and Romans the siege of Troy. On a narrow
      basis of acknowledged truth, an immense but rude superstructure
      of fable has been erected; and the wild Irishman, 13 as well as
      the wild Tartar, 14 could point out the individual son of Japhet,
      from whose loins his ancestors were lineally descended. The last
      century abounded with antiquarians of profound learning and easy
      faith, who, by the dim light of legends and traditions, of
      conjectures and etymologies, conducted the great grandchildren of
      Noah from the Tower of Babel to the extremities of the globe. Of
      these judicious critics, one of the most entertaining was Olaus
      Rudbeck, professor in the university of Upsal. 15 Whatever is
      celebrated either in history or fable this zealous patriot
      ascribes to his country. From Sweden (which formed so
      considerable a part of ancient Germany) the Greeks themselves
      derived their alphabetical characters, their astronomy, and their
      religion. Of that delightful region (for such it appeared to the
      eyes of a native) the Atlantis of Plato, the country of the
      Hyperboreans, the gardens of the Hesperides, the Fortunate
      Islands, and even the Elysian Fields, were all but faint and
      imperfect transcripts. A clime so profusely favored by Nature
      could not long remain desert after the flood. The learned Rudbeck
      allows the family of Noah a few years to multiply from eight to
      about twenty thousand persons. He then disperses them into small
      colonies to replenish the earth, and to propagate the human
      species. The German or Swedish detachment (which marched, if I am
      not mistaken, under the command of Askenaz, the son of Gomer, the
      son of Japhet) distinguished itself by a more than common
      diligence in the prosecution of this great work. The northern
      hive cast its swarms over the greatest part of Europe, Africa,
      and Asia; and (to use the author’s metaphor) the blood circulated
      from the extremities to the heart.

      13 (return) [ According to Dr. Keating, (History of Ireland, p.
      13, 14,) the giant Portholanus, who was the son of Seara, the son
      of Esra, the son of Sru, the son of Framant, the son of
      Fathaclan, the son of Magog, the son of Japhet, the son of Noah,
      landed on the coast of Munster the 14th day of May, in the year
      of the world one thousand nine hundred and seventy-eight. Though
      he succeeded in his great enterprise, the loose behavior of his
      wife rendered his domestic life very unhappy, and provoked him to
      such a degree, that he killed—her favorite greyhound. This, as
      the learned historian very properly observes, was the first

      But all this well-labored system of German antiquities is
      annihilated by a single fact, too well attested to admit of any
      doubt, and of too decisive a nature to leave room for any reply.
      The Germans, in the age of Tacitus, were unacquainted with the
      use of letters; 16 and the use of letters is the principal
      circumstance that distinguishes a civilized people from a herd of
      savages incapable of knowledge or reflection. Without that
      artificial help, the human memory soon dissipates or corrupts the
      ideas intrusted to her charge; and the nobler faculties of the
      mind, no longer supplied with models or with materials, gradually
      forget their powers; the judgment becomes feeble and lethargic,
      the imagination languid or irregular. Fully to apprehend this
      important truth, let us attempt, in an improved society, to
      calculate the immense distance between the man of learning and
      the _illiterate_ peasant. The former, by reading and reflection,
      multiplies his own experience, and lives in distant ages and
      remote countries; whilst the latter, rooted to a single spot, and
      confined to a few years of existence, surpasses but very little
      his fellow-laborer, the ox, in the exercise of his mental
      faculties. The same, and even a greater, difference will be found
      between nations than between individuals; and we may safely
      pronounce, that without some species of writing, no people has
      ever preserved the faithful annals of their history, ever made
      any considerable progress in the abstract sciences, or ever
      possessed, in any tolerable degree of perfection, the useful and
      agreeable arts of life.

      authority, without entering into the obscure disputes concerning
      the antiquity of the Runic characters. The learned Celsius, a
      Swede, a scholar, and a philosopher, was of opinion, that they
      were nothing more than the Roman letters, with the curves changed
      into straight lines for the ease of engraving. See Pelloutier,
      Histoire des Celtes, l. ii. c. 11. Dictionnaire Diplomatique,
      tom. i. p. 223. We may add, that the oldest Runic inscriptions
      are supposed to be of the third century, and the most ancient
      writer who mentions the Runic characters is Venan tius
      Frotunatus, (Carm. vii. 18,) who lived towards the end of the
      sixth century. Barbara fraxineis pingatur Runa tabellis. * Note:
      The obscure subject of the Runic characters has exercised the
      industry and ingenuity of the modern scholars of the north. There
      are three distinct theories; one, maintained by Schlozer,
      (Nordische Geschichte, p. 481, &c.,) who considers their sixteen
      letters to be a corruption of the Roman alphabet, post-Christian
      in their date, and Schlozer would attribute their introduction
      into the north to the Alemanni. The second, that of Frederick
      Schlegel, (Vorlesungen uber alte und neue Literatur,) supposes
      that these characters were left on the coasts of the
      Mediterranean and Northern Seas by the Phœnicians, preserved by
      the priestly castes, and employed for purposes of magic. Their
      common origin from the Phœnician would account for heir
      similarity to the Roman letters. The last, to which we incline,
      claims much higher and more venerable antiquity for the Runic,
      and supposes them to have been the original characters of the
      Indo-Teutonic tribes, brought from the East, and preserved among
      the different races of that stock. See Ueber Deutsche Runen von
      W. C. Grimm, 1821. A Memoir by Dr. Legis. Fundgruben des alten

      Of these arts, the ancient Germans were wretchedly destitute.
      1601 They passed their lives in a state of ignorance and poverty,
      which it has pleased some declaimers to dignify with the
      appellation of virtuous simplicity. Modern Germany is said to
      contain about two thousand three hundred walled towns. 17 In a
      much wider extent of country, the geographer Ptolemy could
      discover no more than ninety places which he decorates with the
      name of cities; 18 though, according to our ideas, they would but
      ill deserve that splendid title. We can only suppose them to have
      been rude fortifications, constructed in the centre of the woods,
      and designed to secure the women, children, and cattle, whilst
      the warriors of the tribe marched out to repel a sudden invasion.
      19 But Tacitus asserts, as a well-known fact, that the Germans,
      in his time, had _no_ cities; 20 and that they affected to
      despise the works of Roman industry, as places of confinement
      rather than of security. 21 Their edifices were not even
      contiguous, or formed into regular villas; 22 each barbarian
      fixed his independent dwelling on the spot to which a plain, a
      wood, or a stream of fresh water, had induced him to give the
      preference. Neither stone, nor brick, nor tiles, were employed in
      these slight habitations. 23 They were indeed no more than low
      huts, of a circular figure, built of rough timber, thatched with
      straw, and pierced at the top to leave a free passage for the
      smoke. In the most inclement winter, the hardy German was
      satisfied with a scanty garment made of the skin of some animal.
      The nations who dwelt towards the North clothed themselves in
      furs; and the women manufactured for their own use a coarse kind
      of linen. 24 The game of various sorts, with which the forests of
      Germany were plentifully stocked, supplied its inhabitants with
      food and exercise. 25 Their monstrous herds of cattle, less
      remarkable indeed for their beauty than for their utility, 26
      formed the principal object of their wealth. A small quantity of
      corn was the only produce exacted from the earth; the use of
      orchards or artificial meadows was unknown to the Germans; nor
      can we expect any improvements in agriculture from a people,
      whose prosperity every year experienced a general change by a new
      division of the arable lands, and who, in that strange operation,
      avoided disputes, by suffering a great part of their territory to
      lie waste and without tillage. 27

      Gold, silver, and iron, were extremely scarce in Germany. Its
      barbarous inhabitants wanted both skill and patience to
      investigate those rich veins of silver, which have so liberally
      rewarded the attention of the princes of Brunswick and Saxony.
      Sweden, which now supplies Europe with iron, was equally ignorant
      of its own riches; and the appearance of the arms of the Germans
      furnished a sufficient proof how little iron they were able to
      bestow on what they must have deemed the noblest use of that
      metal. The various transactions of peace and war had introduced
      some Roman coins (chiefly silver) among the borderers of the
      Rhine and Danube; but the more distant tribes were absolutely
      unacquainted with the use of money, carried on their confined
      traffic by the exchange of commodities, and prized their rude
      earthen vessels as of equal value with the silver vases, the
      presents of Rome to their princes and ambassadors. 28 To a mind
      capable of reflection, such leading facts convey more
      instruction, than a tedious detail of subordinate circumstances.
      The value of money has been settled by general consent to express
      our wants and our property, as letters were invented to express
      our ideas; and both these institutions, by giving a more active
      energy to the powers and passions of human nature, have
      contributed to multiply the objects they were designed to
      represent. The use of gold and silver is in a great measure
      factitious; but it would be impossible to enumerate the important
      and various services which agriculture, and all the arts, have
      received from iron, when tempered and fashioned by the operation
      of fire and the dexterous hand of man. Money, in a word, is the
      most universal incitement, iron the most powerful instrument, of
      human industry; and it is very difficult to conceive by what
      means a people, neither actuated by the one, nor seconded by the
      other, could emerge from the grossest barbarism. 29

      If we contemplate a savage nation in any part of the globe, a
      supine indolence and a carelessness of futurity will be found to
      constitute their general character. In a civilized state every
      faculty of man is expanded and exercised; and the great chain of
      mutual dependence connects and embraces the several members of
      society. The most numerous portion of it is employed in constant
      and useful labor. The select few, placed by fortune above that
      necessity, can, however, fill up their time by the pursuits of
      interest or glory, by the improvement of their estate or of their
      understanding, by the duties, the pleasures, and even the follies
      of social life. The Germans were not possessed of these varied
      resources. The care of the house and family, the management of
      the land and cattle, were delegated to the old and the infirm, to
      women and slaves. The lazy warrior, destitute of every art that
      might employ his leisure hours, consumed his days and nights in
      the animal gratifications of sleep and food. And yet, by a
      wonderful diversity of nature, (according to the remark of a
      writer who had pierced into its darkest recesses,) the same
      barbarians are by turns the most indolent and the most restless
      of mankind. They delight in sloth, they detest tranquility. 30
      The languid soul, oppressed with its own weight, anxiously
      required some new and powerful sensation; and war and danger were
      the only amusements adequate to its fierce temper. The sound that
      summoned the German to arms was grateful to his ear. It roused
      him from his uncomfortable lethargy, gave him an active pursuit,
      and, by strong exercise of the body, and violent emotions of the
      mind, restored him to a more lively sense of his existence. In
      the dull intervals of peace, these barbarians were immoderately
      addicted to deep gaming and excessive drinking; both of which, by
      different means, the one by inflaming their passions, the other
      by extinguishing their reason, alike relieved them from the pain
      of thinking. They gloried in passing whole days and nights at
      table; and the blood of friends and relations often stained their
      numerous and drunken assemblies. 31 Their debts of honor (for in
      that light they have transmitted to us those of play) they
      discharged with the most romantic fidelity. The desperate
      gamester, who had staked his person and liberty on a last throw
      of the dice, patiently submitted to the decision of fortune, and
      suffered himself to be bound, chastised, and sold into remote
      slavery, by his weaker but more lucky antagonist. 32

      Strong beer, a liquor extracted with very little art from wheat
      or barley, and _corrupted_ (as it is strongly expressed by
      Tacitus) into a certain semblance of wine, was sufficient for the
      gross purposes of German debauchery. But those who had tasted the
      rich wines of Italy, and afterwards of Gaul, sighed for that more
      delicious species of intoxication. They attempted not, however,
      (as has since been executed with so much success,) to naturalize
      the vine on the banks of the Rhine and Danube; nor did they
      endeavor to procure by industry the materials of an advantageous
      commerce. To solicit by labor what might be ravished by arms, was
      esteemed unworthy of the German spirit. 33 The intemperate thirst
      of strong liquors often urged the barbarians to invade the
      provinces on which art or nature had bestowed those much envied
      presents. The Tuscan who betrayed his country to the Celtic
      nations, attracted them into Italy by the prospect of the rich
      fruits and delicious wines, the productions of a happier climate.
      34 And in the same manner the German auxiliaries, invited into
      France during the civil wars of the sixteenth century, were
      allured by the promise of plenteous quarters in the provinces of
      Champaigne and Burgundy. 35 Drunkenness, the most illiberal, but
      not the most dangerous of _our_ vices, was sometimes capable, in
      a less civilized state of mankind, of occasioning a battle, a
      war, or a revolution.

      The climate of ancient Germany has been modified, and the soil
      fertilized, by the labor of ten centuries from the time of
      Charlemagne. The same extent of ground which at present
      maintains, in ease and plenty, a million of husbandmen and
      artificers, was unable to supply a hundred thousand lazy warriors
      with the simple necessaries of life. 36 The Germans abandoned
      their immense forests to the exercise of hunting, employed in
      pasturage the most considerable part of their lands, bestowed on
      the small remainder a rude and careless cultivation, and then
      accused the scantiness and sterility of a country that refused to
      maintain the multitude of its inhabitants. When the return of
      famine severely admonished them of the importance of the arts,
      the national distress was sometimes alleviated by the emigration
      of a third, perhaps, or a fourth part of their youth. 37 The
      possession and the enjoyment of property are the pledges which
      bind a civilized people to an improved country. But the Germans,
      who carried with them what they most valued, their arms, their
      cattle, and their women, cheerfully abandoned the vast silence of
      their woods for the unbounded hopes of plunder and conquest. The
      innumerable swarms that issued, or seemed to issue, from the
      great storehouse of nations, were multiplied by the fears of the
      vanquished, and by the credulity of succeeding ages. And from
      facts thus exaggerated, an opinion was gradually established, and
      has been supported by writers of distinguished reputation, that,
      in the age of Cæsar and Tacitus, the inhabitants of the North
      were far more numerous than they are in our days. 38 A more
      serious inquiry into the causes of population seems to have
      convinced modern philosophers of the falsehood, and indeed the
      impossibility, of the supposition. To the names of Mariana and of

      A warlike nation like the Germans, without either cities,
      letters, arts, or money, found some compensation for this savage
      state in the enjoyment of liberty. Their poverty secured their
      freedom, since our desires and our possessions are the strongest
      fetters of despotism. “Among the Suiones (says Tacitus) riches
      are held in honor. They are _therefore_ subject to an absolute
      monarch, who, instead of intrusting his people with the free use
      of arms, as is practised in the rest of Germany, commits them to
      the safe custody, not of a citizen, or even of a freedman, but of
      a slave. The neighbors of the Suiones, the Sitones, are sunk even
      below servitude; they obey a woman.” 41 In the mention of these
      exceptions, the great historian sufficiently acknowledges the
      general theory of government. We are only at a loss to conceive
      by what means riches and despotism could penetrate into a remote
      corner of the North, and extinguish the generous flame that
      blazed with such fierceness on the frontier of the Roman
      provinces, or how the ancestors of those Danes and Norwegians, so
      distinguished in latter ages by their unconquered spirit, could
      thus tamely resign the great character of German liberty. 42 Some
      tribes, however, on the coast of the Baltic, acknowledged the
      authority of kings, though without relinquishing the rights of
      men, 43 but in the far greater part of Germany, the form of
      government was a democracy, tempered, indeed, and controlled, not
      so much by general and positive laws, as by the occasional
      ascendant of birth or valor, of eloquence or superstition. 44

      Civil governments, in their first institution, are voluntary
      associations for mutual defence. To obtain the desired end, it is
      absolutely necessary that each individual should conceive himself
      obliged to submit his private opinions and actions to the
      judgment of the greater number of his associates. The German
      tribes were contented with this rude but liberal outline of
      political society. As soon as a youth, born of free parents, had
      attained the age of manhood, he was introduced into the general
      council of his countrymen, solemnly invested with a shield and
      spear, and adopted as an equal and worthy member of the military
      commonwealth. The assembly of the warriors of the tribe was
      convened at stated seasons, or on sudden emergencies. The trial
      of public offences, the election of magistrates, and the great
      business of peace and war, were determined by its independent
      voice. Sometimes indeed, these important questions were
      previously considered and prepared in a more select council of
      the principal chieftains. 45 The magistrates might deliberate and
      persuade, the people only could resolve and execute; and the
      resolutions of the Germans were for the most part hasty and
      violent. Barbarians accustomed to place their freedom in
      gratifying the present passion, and their courage in overlooking
      all future consequences, turned away with indignant contempt from
      the remonstrances of justice and policy, and it was the practice
      to signify by a hollow murmur their dislike of such timid
      counsels. But whenever a more popular orator proposed to
      vindicate the meanest citizen from either foreign or domestic
      injury, whenever he called upon his fellow-countrymen to assert
      the national honor, or to pursue some enterprise full of danger
      and glory, a loud clashing of shields and spears expressed the
      eager applause of the assembly. For the Germans always met in
      arms, and it was constantly to be dreaded, lest an irregular
      multitude, inflamed with faction and strong liquors, should use
      those arms to enforce, as well as to declare, their furious
      resolves. We may recollect how often the diets of Poland have
      been polluted with blood, and the more numerous party has been
      compelled to yield to the more violent and seditious. 46

      A general of the tribe was elected on occasions of danger; and,
      if the danger was pressing and extensive, several tribes
      concurred in the choice of the same general. The bravest warrior
      was named to lead his countrymen into the field, by his example
      rather than by his commands. But this power, however limited, was
      still invidious. It expired with the war, and in time of peace
      the German tribes acknowledged not any supreme chief. 47
      _Princes_ were, however, appointed, in the general assembly, to
      administer justice, or rather to compose differences, 48 in their
      respective districts. In the choice of these magistrates, as much
      regard was shown to birth as to merit. 49 To each was assigned,
      by the public, a guard, and a council of a hundred persons, and
      the first of the princes appears to have enjoyed a preeminence of
      rank and honor which sometimes tempted the Romans to compliment

      The comparative view of the powers of the magistrates, in two
      remarkable instances, is alone sufficient to represent the whole
      system of German manners. The disposal of the landed property
      within their district was absolutely vested in their hands, and
      they distributed it every year according to a new division. 51 At
      the same time they were not authorized to punish with death, to
      imprison, or even to strike a private citizen. 52 A people thus
      jealous of their persons, and careless of their possessions, must
      have been totally destitute of industry and the arts, but
      animated with a high sense of honor and independence.

      Chapter IX: State Of Germany Until The Barbarians.—Part III.

      The Germans respected only those duties which they imposed on
      themselves. The most obscure soldier resisted with disdain the
      authority of the magistrates. “The noblest youths blushed not to
      be numbered among the faithful companions of some renowned chief,
      to whom they devoted their arms and service. A noble emulation
      prevailed among the companions to obtain the first place in the
      esteem of their chief; amongst the chiefs, to acquire the
      greatest number of valiant companions. To be ever surrounded by a
      band of select youths was the pride and strength of the chiefs,
      their ornament in peace, their defence in war. The glory of such
      distinguished heroes diffused itself beyond the narrow limits of
      their own tribe. Presents and embassies solicited their
      friendship, and the fame of their arms often insured victory to
      the party which they espoused. In the hour of danger it was
      shameful for the chief to be surpassed in valor by his
      companions; shameful for the companions not to equal the valor of
      their chief. To survive his fall in battle was indelible infamy.
      To protect his person, and to adorn his glory with the trophies
      of their own exploits, were the most sacred of their duties. The
      chiefs combated for victory, the companions for the chief. The
      noblest warriors, whenever their native country was sunk into the
      laziness of peace, maintained their numerous bands in some
      distant scene of action, to exercise their restless spirit, and
      to acquire renown by voluntary dangers. Gifts worthy of
      soldiers—the warlike steed, the bloody and ever victorious
      lance—were the rewards which the companions claimed from the
      liberality of their chief. The rude plenty of his hospitable
      board was the only pay that _he_ could bestow, or _they_ would
      accept. War, rapine, and the free-will offerings of his friends,
      supplied the materials of this munificence.” 53 This institution,
      however it might accidentally weaken the several republics,
      invigorated the general character of the Germans, and even
      ripened amongst them all the virtues of which barbarians are
      susceptible; the faith and valor, the hospitality and the
      courtesy, so conspicuous long afterwards in the ages of chivalry.

      The honorable gifts, bestowed by the chief on his brave
      companions, have been supposed, by an ingenious writer, to
      contain the first rudiments of the fiefs, distributed after the
      conquest of the Roman provinces, by the barbarian lords among
      their vassals, with a similar duty of homage and military
      service. 54 These conditions are, however, very repugnant to the
      maxims of the ancient Germans, who delighted in mutual presents,
      but without either imposing, or accepting, the weight of
      obligations. 55

      “In the days of chivalry, or more properly of romance, all the
      men were brave and all the women were chaste;” and
      notwithstanding the latter of these virtues is acquired and
      preserved with much more difficulty than the former, it is
      ascribed, almost without exception, to the wives of the ancient
      Germans. Polygamy was not in use, except among the princes, and
      among them only for the sake of multiplying their alliances.
      Divorces were prohibited by manners rather than by laws.
      Adulteries were punished as rare and inexpiable crimes; nor was
      seduction justified by example and fashion. 56 We may easily
      discover that Tacitus indulges an honest pleasure in the contrast
      of barbarian virtue with the dissolute conduct of the Roman
      ladies; yet there are some striking circumstances that give an
      air of truth, or at least probability, to the conjugal faith and
      chastity of the Germans.

      56 (return) [ The adulteress was whipped through the village.
      Neither wealth nor beauty could inspire compassion, or procure
      her a second husband. 18, 19.]

      Although the progress of civilization has undoubtedly contributed
      to assuage the fiercer passions of human nature, it seems to have
      been less favorable to the virtue of chastity, whose most
      dangerous enemy is the softness of the mind. The refinements of
      life corrupt while they polish the intercourse of the sexes. The
      gross appetite of love becomes most dangerous when it is
      elevated, or rather, indeed, disguised by sentimental passion.
      The elegance of dress, of motion, and of manners, gives a lustre
      to beauty, and inflames the senses through the imagination.
      Luxurious entertainments, midnight dances, and licentious
      spectacles, present at once temptation and opportunity to female
      frailty. 57 From such dangers the unpolished wives of the
      barbarians were secured by poverty, solitude, and the painful
      cares of a domestic life. The German huts, open, on every side,
      to the eye of indiscretion or jealousy, were a better safeguard
      of conjugal fidelity than the walls, the bolts, and the eunuchs
      of a Persian harem. To this reason another may be added of a more
      honorable nature. The Germans treated their women with esteem and
      confidence, consulted them on every occasion of importance, and
      fondly believed, that in their breasts resided a sanctity and
      wisdom more than human. Some of the interpreters of fate, such as
      Velleda, in the Batavian war, governed, in the name of the deity,
      the fiercest nations of Germany. 58 The rest of the sex, without
      being adored as goddesses, were respected as the free and equal
      companions of soldiers; associated even by the marriage ceremony
      to a life of toil, of danger, and of glory. 59 In their great
      invasions, the camps of the barbarians were filled with a
      multitude of women, who remained firm and undaunted amidst the
      sound of arms, the various forms of destruction, and the
      honorable wounds of their sons and husbands. 60 Fainting armies
      of Germans have, more than once, been driven back upon the enemy
      by the generous despair of the women, who dreaded death much less
      than servitude. If the day was irrecoverably lost, they well knew
      how to deliver themselves and their children, with their own
      hands, from an insulting victor. 61 Heroines of such a cast may
      claim our admiration; but they were most assuredly neither lovely
      nor very susceptible of love. Whilst they affected to emulate the
      stern virtues of _man_, they must have resigned that attractive
      softness in which principally consist the charm and weakness of
      _woman_. Conscious pride taught the German females to suppress
      every tender emotion that stood in competition with honor, and
      the first honor of the sex has ever been that of chastity. The
      sentiments and conduct of these high-spirited matrons may, at
      once, be considered as a cause, as an effect, and as a proof of
      the general character of the nation. Female courage, however it
      may be raised by fanaticism, or confirmed by habit, can be only a
      faint and imperfect imitation of the manly valor that
      distinguishes the age or country in which it may be found.

      The religious system of the Germans (if the wild opinions of
      savages can deserve that name) was dictated by their wants, their
      fears, and their ignorance. 62 They adored the great visible
      objects and agents of nature, the Sun and the Moon, the Fire and
      the Earth; together with those imaginary deities, who were
      supposed to preside over the most important occupations of human
      life. They were persuaded, that, by some ridiculous arts of
      divination, they could discover the will of the superior beings,
      and that human sacrifices were the most precious and acceptable
      offering to their altars. Some applause has been hastily bestowed
      on the sublime notion, entertained by that people, of the Deity,
      whom they neither confined within the walls of the temple, nor
      represented by any human figure; but when we recollect, that the
      Germans were unskilled in architecture, and totally unacquainted
      with the art of sculpture, we shall readily assign the true
      reason of a scruple, which arose not so much from a superiority
      of reason, as from a want of ingenuity. The only temples in
      Germany were dark and ancient groves, consecrated by the
      reverence of succeeding generations. Their secret gloom, the
      imagined residence of an invisible power, by presenting no
      distinct object of fear or worship, impressed the mind with a
      still deeper sense of religious horror; 63 and the priests, rude
      and illiterate as they were, had been taught by experience the
      use of every artifice that could preserve and fortify impressions
      so well suited to their own interest.

      habitations, they raised also temples, such as that to the
      goddess Teufana, who presided over divination. See Adelung, Hist.
      of Ane Germans, p 296—G]

      The same ignorance, which renders barbarians incapable of
      conceiving or embracing the useful restraints of laws, exposes
      them naked and unarmed to the blind terrors of superstition. The
      German priests, improving this favorable temper of their
      countrymen, had assumed a jurisdiction even in temporal concerns,
      which the magistrate could not venture to exercise; and the
      haughty warrior patiently submitted to the lash of correction,
      when it was inflicted, not by any human power, but by the
      immediate order of the god of war. 64 The defects of civil policy
      were sometimes supplied by the interposition of ecclesiastical
      authority. The latter was constantly exerted to maintain silence
      and decency in the popular assemblies; and was sometimes extended
      to a more enlarged concern for the national welfare. A solemn
      procession was occasionally celebrated in the present countries
      of Mecklenburgh and Pomerania. The unknown symbol of the _Earth_,
      covered with a thick veil, was placed on a carriage drawn by
      cows; and in this manner the goddess, whose common residence was
      in the Isles of Rugen, visited several adjacent tribes of her
      worshippers. During her progress the sound of war was hushed,
      quarrels were suspended, arms laid aside, and the restless
      Germans had an opportunity of tasting the blessings of peace and
      harmony. 65 The _truce of God_, so often and so ineffectually
      proclaimed by the clergy of the eleventh century, was an obvious
      imitation of this ancient custom. 66

      But the influence of religion was far more powerful to inflame,
      than to moderate, the fierce passions of the Germans. Interest
      and fanaticism often prompted its ministers to sanctify the most
      daring and the most unjust enterprises, by the approbation of
      Heaven, and full assurances of success. The consecrated
      standards, long revered in the groves of superstition, were
      placed in the front of the battle; 67 and the hostile army was
      devoted with dire execrations to the gods of war and of thunder.
      68 In the faith of soldiers (and such were the Germans) cowardice
      is the most unpardonable of sins. A brave man was the worthy
      favorite of their martial deities; the wretch who had lost his
      shield was alike banished from the religious and civil assemblies
      of his countrymen. Some tribes of the north seem to have embraced
      the doctrine of transmigration, 69 others imagined a gross
      paradise of immortal drunkenness. 70 All agreed that a life spent
      in arms, and a glorious death in battle, were the best
      preparations for a happy futurity, either in this or in another
      world.

      The immortality so vainly promised by the priests, was, in some
      degree, conferred by the bards. That singular order of men has
      most deservedly attracted the notice of all who have attempted to
      investigate the antiquities of the Celts, the Scandinavians, and
      the Germans. Their genius and character, as well as the reverence
      paid to that important office, have been sufficiently
      illustrated. But we cannot so easily express, or even conceive,
      the enthusiasm of arms and glory which they kindled in the breast
      of their audience. Among a polished people a taste for poetry is
      rather an amusement of the fancy than a passion of the soul. And
      yet, when in calm retirement we peruse the combats described by
      Homer or Tasso, we are insensibly seduced by the fiction, and
      feel a momentary glow of martial ardor. But how faint, how cold
      is the sensation which a peaceful mind can receive from solitary
      study! It was in the hour of battle, or in the feast of victory,
      that the bards celebrated the glory of the heroes of ancient
      days, the ancestors of those warlike chieftains, who listened
      with transport to their artless but animated strains. The view of
      arms and of danger heightened the effect of the military song;
      and the passions which it tended to excite, the desire of fame,
      and the contempt of death, were the habitual sentiments of a
      German mind. 71 711

      into the fainting Spartans. Yet there is little probability that
      the Greeks and the Germans were the same people. Much learned
      trifling might be spared, if our antiquarians would condescend to
      reflect, that similar manners will naturally be produced by
      similar situations.]

      711 (return) [ Besides these battle songs, the Germans sang at
      their festival banquets, (Tac. Ann. i. 65,) and around the bodies
      of their slain heroes. King Theodoric, of the tribe of the Goths,
      killed in a battle against Attila, was honored by songs while he
      was borne from the field of battle. Jornandes, c. 41. The same
      honor was paid to the remains of Attila. Ibid. c. 49. According
      to some historians, the Germans had songs also at their weddings;
      but this appears to me inconsistent with their customs, in which
      marriage was no more than the purchase of a wife. Besides, there
      is but one instance of this, that of the Gothic king, Ataulph,
      who sang himself the nuptial hymn when he espoused Placidia,
      sister of the emperors Arcadius and Honorius, (Olympiodor. p. 8.)
      But this marriage was celebrated according to the Roman rites, of
      which the nuptial songs formed a part. Adelung, p. 382.—G.
      Charlemagne is said to have collected the national songs of the
      ancient Germans. Eginhard, Vit. Car. Mag.—M.]

      Such was the situation, and such were the manners of the ancient
      Germans. Their climate, their want of learning, of arts, and of
      laws, their notions of honor, of gallantry, and of religion,
      their sense of freedom, impatience of peace, and thirst of
      enterprise, all contributed to form a people of military heroes.
      And yet we find, that during more than two hundred and fifty
      years that elapsed from the defeat of Varus to the reign of
      Decius, these formidable barbarians made few considerable
      attempts, and not any material impression on the luxurious, and
      enslaved provinces of the empire. Their progress was checked by
      their want of arms and discipline, and their fury was diverted by
      the intestine divisions of ancient Germany. I. It has been
      observed, with ingenuity, and not without truth, that the command
      of iron soon gives a nation the command of gold. But the rude
      tribes of Germany, alike destitute of both those valuable metals,
      were reduced slowly to acquire, by their unassisted strength, the
      possession of the one as well as the other. The face of a German
      army displayed their poverty of iron. Swords, and the longer kind
      of lances, they could seldom use. Their _frameæ_ (as they called
      them in their own language) were long spears headed with a sharp
      but narrow iron point, and which, as occasion required, they
      either darted from a distance, or pushed in close onset. With
      this spear, and with a shield, their cavalry was contented. A
      multitude of darts, scattered 72 with incredible force, were an
      additional resource of the infantry. Their military dress, when
      they wore any, was nothing more than a loose mantle. A variety of
      colors was the only ornament of their wooden or osier shields.
      Few of the chiefs were distinguished by cuirasses, scarcely any
      by helmets. Though the horses of Germany were neither beautiful,
      swift, nor practised in the skilful evolutions of the Roman
      manege, several of the nations obtained renown by their cavalry;
      but, in general, the principal strength of the Germans consisted
      in their infantry, 73 which was drawn up in several deep columns,
      according to the distinction of tribes and families. Impatient of
      fatigue and delay, these half-armed warriors rushed to battle
      with dissonant shouts and disordered ranks; and sometimes, by the
      effort of native valor, prevailed over the constrained and more
      artificial bravery of the Roman mercenaries. But as the
      barbarians poured forth their whole souls on the first onset,
      they knew not how to rally or to retire. A repulse was a sure
      defeat; and a defeat was most commonly total destruction. When we
      recollect the complete armor of the Roman soldiers, their
      discipline, exercises, evolutions, fortified camps, and military
      engines, it appears a just matter of surprise, how the naked and
      unassisted valor of the barbarians could dare to encounter, in
      the field, the strength of the legions, and the various troops of
      the auxiliaries, which seconded their operations. The contest was
      too unequal, till the introduction of luxury had enervated the
      vigor, and a spirit of disobedience and sedition had relaxed the
      discipline, of the Roman armies. The introduction of barbarian
      auxiliaries into those armies, was a measure attended with very
      obvious dangers, as it might gradually instruct the Germans in
      the arts of war and of policy. Although they were admitted in
      small numbers and with the strictest precaution, the example of
      Civilis was proper to convince the Romans, that the danger was
      not imaginary, and that their precautions were not always
      sufficient. 74 During the civil wars that followed the death of
      Nero, that artful and intrepid Batavian, whom his enemies
      condescended to compare with Hannibal and Sertorius, 75 formed a
      great design of freedom and ambition. Eight Batavian cohorts
      renowned in the wars of Britain and Italy, repaired to his
      standard. He introduced an army of Germans into Gaul, prevailed
      on the powerful cities of Treves and Langres to embrace his
      cause, defeated the legions, destroyed their fortified camps, and
      employed against the Romans the military knowledge which he had
      acquired in their service. When at length, after an obstinate
      struggle, he yielded to the power of the empire, Civilis secured
      himself and his country by an honorable treaty. The Batavians
      still continued to occupy the islands of the Rhine, 76 the
      allies, not the servants, of the Roman monarchy.

      II. The strength of ancient Germany appears formidable, when we
      consider the effects that might have been produced by its united
      effort. The wide extent of country might very possibly contain a
      million of warriors, as all who were of age to bear arms were of
      a temper to use them. But this fierce multitude, incapable of
      concerting or executing any plan of national greatness, was
      agitated by various and often hostile intentions. Germany was
      divided into more than forty independent states; and, even in
      each state, the union of the several tribes was extremely loose
      and precarious. The barbarians were easily provoked; they knew
      not how to forgive an injury, much less an insult; their
      resentments were bloody and implacable. The casual disputes that
      so frequently happened in their tumultuous parties of hunting or
      drinking were sufficient to inflame the minds of whole nations;
      the private feuds of any considerable chieftains diffused itself
      among their followers and allies. To chastise the insolent, or to
      plunder the defenceless, were alike causes of war. The most
      formidable states of Germany affected to encompass their
      territories with a wide frontier of solitude and devastation. The
      awful distance preserved by their neighbors attested the terror
      of their arms, and in some measure defended them from the danger
      of unexpected incursions. 77

      77 (return) [ Cæsar de Bell. Gal. l. vi. 23.]

      “The Bructeri 771 (it is Tacitus who now speaks) were totally
      exterminated by the neighboring tribes, 78 provoked by their
      insolence, allured by the hopes of spoil, and perhaps inspired by
      the tutelar deities of the empire. Above sixty thousand
      barbarians were destroyed; not by the Roman arms, but in our
      sight, and for our entertainment. May the nations, enemies of
      Rome, ever preserve this enmity to each other! We have now
      attained the utmost verge of prosperity, 79 and have nothing left
      to demand of fortune, except the discord of the barbarians.”
      80—These sentiments, less worthy of the humanity than of the
      patriotism of Tacitus, express the invariable maxims of the
      policy of his countrymen. They deemed it a much safer expedient
      to divide than to combat the barbarians, from whose defeat they
      could derive neither honor nor advantage. The money and
      negotiations of Rome insinuated themselves into the heart of
      Germany; and every art of seduction was used with dignity, to
      conciliate those nations whom their proximity to the Rhine or
      Danube might render the most useful friends as well as the most
      troublesome enemies. Chiefs of renown and power were flattered by
      the most trifling presents, which they received either as marks
      of distinction, or as the instruments of luxury. In civil
      dissensions the weaker faction endeavored to strengthen its
      interest by entering into secret connections with the governors
      of the frontier provinces. Every quarrel among the Germans was
      fomented by the intrigues of Rome; and every plan of union and
      public good was defeated by the stronger bias of private jealousy
      and interest. 81

      The general conspiracy which terrified the Romans under the reign
      of Marcus Antoninus, comprehended almost all the nations of
      Germany, and even Sarmatia, from the mouth of the Rhine to that
      of the Danube. 82 It is impossible for us to determine whether
      this hasty confederation was formed by necessity, by reason, or
      by passion; but we may rest assured, that the barbarians were
      neither allured by the indolence, nor provoked by the ambition,
      of the Roman monarch. This dangerous invasion required all the
      firmness and vigilance of Marcus. He fixed generals of ability in
      the several stations of attack, and assumed in person the conduct
      of the most important province on the Upper Danube. After a long
      and doubtful conflict, the spirit of the barbarians was subdued.
      The Quadi and the Marcomanni, 83 who had taken the lead in the
      war, were the most severely punished in its catastrophe. They
      were commanded to retire five miles 84 from their own banks of
      the Danube, and to deliver up the flower of the youth, who were
      immediately sent into Britain, a remote island, where they might
      be secure as hostages, and useful as soldiers. 85 On the frequent
      rebellions of the Quadi and Marcomanni, the irritated emperor
      resolved to reduce their country into the form of a province. His
      designs were disappointed by death. This formidable league,
      however, the only one that appears in the two first centuries of
      the Imperial history, was entirely dissipated, without leaving
      any traces behind in Germany.

      In the course of this introductory chapter, we have confined
      ourselves to the general outlines of the manners of Germany,
      without attempting to describe or to distinguish the various
      tribes which filled that great country in the time of Cæsar, of
      Tacitus, or of Ptolemy. As the ancient, or as new tribes
      successively present themselves in the series of this history, we
      shall concisely mention their origin, their situation, and their
      particular character. Modern nations are fixed and permanent
      societies, connected among themselves by laws and government,
      bound to their native soil by art and agriculture. The German
      tribes were voluntary and fluctuating associations of soldiers,
      almost of savages. The same territory often changed its
      inhabitants in the tide of conquest and emigration. The same
      communities, uniting in a plan of defence or invasion, bestowed a
      new title on their new confederacy. The dissolution of an ancient
      confederacy restored to the independent tribes their peculiar but
      long-forgotten appellation. A victorious state often communicated
      its own name to a vanquished people. Sometimes crowds of
      volunteers flocked from all parts to the standard of a favorite
      leader; his camp became their country, and some circumstance of
      the enterprise soon gave a common denomination to the mixed
      multitude. The distinctions of the ferocious invaders were
      perpetually varied by themselves, and confounded by the
      astonished subjects of the Roman empire. 86

      Wars, and the administration of public affairs, are the principal
      subjects of history; but the number of persons interested in
      these busy scenes is very different, according to the different
      condition of mankind. In great monarchies, millions of obedient
      subjects pursue their useful occupations in peace and obscurity.
      The attention of the writer, as well as of the reader, is solely
      confined to a court, a capital, a regular army, and the districts
      which happen to be the occasional scene of military operations.
      But a state of freedom and barbarism, the season of civil
      commotions, or the situation of petty republics, 87 raises almost
      every member of the community into action, and consequently into
      notice. The irregular divisions, and the restless motions, of the
      people of Germany, dazzle our imagination, and seem to multiply
      their numbers. The profuse enumeration of kings, of warriors, of
      armies and nations, inclines us to forget that the same objects
      are continually repeated under a variety of appellations, and
      that the most splendid appellations have been frequently lavished
      on the most inconsiderable objects.
