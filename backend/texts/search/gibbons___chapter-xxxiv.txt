Chapter XXXIV: Attila.—Part I.

     The Character, Conquests, And Court Of Attila, King Of The
     Huns.—Death Of Theodosius The Younger.—Elevation Of Marcian To The
     Empire Of The East.

      The Western world was oppressed by the Goths and Vandals, who
      fled before the Huns; but the achievements of the Huns themselves
      were not adequate to their power and prosperity. Their victorious
      hordes had spread from the Volga to the Danube; but the public
      force was exhausted by the discord of independent chieftains;
      their valor was idly consumed in obscure and predatory
      excursions; and they often degraded their national dignity, by
      condescending, for the hopes of spoil, to enlist under the
      banners of their fugitive enemies. In the reign of Attila, 1 the
      Huns again became the terror of the world; and I shall now
      describe the character and actions of that formidable Barbarian;
      who alternately insulted and invaded the East and the West, and
      urged the rapid downfall of the Roman empire.

      1 (return) [ The authentic materials for the history of Attila,
      may be found in Jornandes (de Rebus Geticis, c. 34-50, p.
      668-688, edit. Grot.) and Priscus (Excerpta de Legationibus, p.
      33-76, Paris, 1648.) I have not seen the Lives of Attila,
      composed by Juvencus Caelius Calanus Dalmatinus, in the twelfth
      century, or by Nicholas Olahus, archbishop of Gran, in the
      sixteenth. See Mascou’s History of the Germans, ix., and Maffei
      Osservazioni Litterarie, tom. i. p. 88, 89. Whatever the modern
      Hungarians have added must be fabulous; and they do not seem to
      have excelled in the art of fiction. They suppose, that when
      Attila invaded Gaul and Italy, married innumerable wives, &c., he
      was one hundred and twenty years of age. Thewrocz Chron. c. i. p.
      22, in Script. Hunger. tom. i. p. 76.]

      In the tide of emigration which impetuously rolled from the
      confines of China to those of Germany, the most powerful and
      populous tribes may commonly be found on the verge of the Roman
      provinces. The accumulated weight was sustained for a while by
      artificial barriers; and the easy condescension of the emperors
      invited, without satisfying, the insolent demands of the
      Barbarians, who had acquired an eager appetite for the luxuries
      of civilized life. The Hungarians, who ambitiously insert the
      name of Attila among their native kings, may affirm with truth
      that the hordes, which were subject to his uncle Roas, or
      Rugilas, had formed their encampments within the limits of modern
      Hungary, 2 in a fertile country, which liberally supplied the
      wants of a nation of hunters and shepherds. In this advantageous
      situation, Rugilas, and his valiant brothers, who continually
      added to their power and reputation, commanded the alternative of
      peace or war with the two empires. His alliance with the Romans
      of the West was cemented by his personal friendship for the great
      Ætius; who was always secure of finding, in the Barbarian camp,
      a hospitable reception and a powerful support. At his
      solicitation, and in the name of John the usurper, sixty thousand
      Huns advanced to the confines of Italy; their march and their
      retreat were alike expensive to the state; and the grateful
      policy of Ætius abandoned the possession of Pannonia to his
      faithful confederates. The Romans of the East were not less
      apprehensive of the arms of Rugilas, which threatened the
      provinces, or even the capital. Some ecclesiastical historians
      have destroyed the Barbarians with lightning and pestilence; 3
      but Theodosius was reduced to the more humble expedient of
      stipulating an annual payment of three hundred and fifty pounds
      of gold, and of disguising this dishonorable tribute by the title
      of general, which the king of the Huns condescended to accept.
      The public tranquillity was frequently interrupted by the fierce
      impatience of the Barbarians, and the perfidious intrigues of the
      Byzantine court. Four dependent nations, among whom we may
      distinguish the Barbarians, disclaimed the sovereignty of the
      Huns; and their revolt was encouraged and protected by a Roman
      alliance; till the just claims, and formidable power, of Rugilas,
      were effectually urged by the voice of Eslaw his ambassador.
      Peace was the unanimous wish of the senate: their decree was
      ratified by the emperor; and two ambassadors were named,
      Plinthas, a general of Scythian extraction, but of consular rank;
      and the quaestor Epigenes, a wise and experienced statesman, who
      was recommended to that office by his ambitious colleague.

      Scythian colonies. 1. The Huns of Attila; 2. The Abares, in the
      sixth century; and, 3. The Turks or Magiars, A.D. 889; the
      immediate and genuine ancestors of the modern Hungarians, whose
      connection with the two former is extremely faint and remote. The
      Prodromus and Notitia of Matthew Belius appear to contain a rich
      fund of information concerning ancient and modern Hungary. I have
      seen the extracts in Bibliothèque Ancienne et Moderne, tom.
      xxii. p. 1-51, and Bibliothèque Raisonnée, tom. xvi. p. 127-175.
      * Note: Mailath (in his Geschichte der Magyaren) considers the
      question of the origin of the Magyars as still undecided. The old
      Hungarian chronicles unanimously derived them from the Huns of
      Attila See note, vol. iv. pp. 341, 342. The later opinion,
      adopted by Schlozer, Belnay, and Dankowsky, ascribes them, from
      their language, to the Finnish race. Fessler, in his history of
      Hungary, agrees with Gibbon in supposing them Turks. Mailath has
      inserted an ingenious dissertation of Fejer, which attempts to
      connect them with the Parthians. Vol. i. Ammerkungen p. 50—M.]

      authors, strenuously contends (Hist. des Emp. tom. vi. p. 136,

      The death of Rugilas suspended the progress of the treaty. His
      two nephews, Attila and Bleda, who succeeded to the throne of
      their uncle, consented to a personal interview with the
      ambassadors of Constantinople; but as they proudly refused to
      dismount, the business was transacted on horseback, in a spacious
      plain near the city of Margus, in the Upper Maesia. The kings of
      the Huns assumed the solid benefits, as well as the vain honors,
      of the negotiation. They dictated the conditions of peace, and
      each condition was an insult on the majesty of the empire.
      Besides the freedom of a safe and plentiful market on the banks
      of the Danube, they required that the annual contribution should
      be augmented from three hundred and fifty to seven hundred pounds
      of gold; that a fine or ransom of eight pieces of gold should be
      paid for every Roman captive who had escaped from his Barbarian
      master; that the emperor should renounce all treaties and
      engagements with the enemies of the Huns; and that all the
      fugitives who had taken refuge in the court or provinces of
      Theodosius, should be delivered to the justice of their offended
      sovereign. This justice was rigorously inflicted on some
      unfortunate youths of a royal race. They were crucified on the
      territories of the empire, by the command of Attila: and as soon
      as the king of the Huns had impressed the Romans with the terror
      of his name, he indulged them in a short and arbitrary respite,
      whilst he subdued the rebellious or independent nations of
      Scythia and Germany. 4

      4 (return) [ See Priscus, p. 47, 48, and Hist. de Peuples de
      l’Europe, tom. v. i. c. xii, xiii, xiv, xv.]

      Attila, the son of Mundzuk, deduced his noble, perhaps his regal,
      descent 5 from the ancient Huns, who had formerly contended with
      the monarchs of China. His features, according to the observation
      of a Gothic historian, bore the stamp of his national origin; and
      the portrait of Attila exhibits the genuine deformity of a modern
      Calmuk; 6 a large head, a swarthy complexion, small, deep-seated
      eyes, a flat nose, a few hairs in the place of a beard, broad
      shoulders, and a short square body, of nervous strength, though
      of a disproportioned form. The haughty step and demeanor of the
      king of the Huns expressed the consciousness of his superiority
      above the rest of mankind; and he had a custom of fiercely
      rolling his eyes, as if he wished to enjoy the terror which he
      inspired. Yet this savage hero was not inaccessible to pity; his
      suppliant enemies might confide in the assurance of peace or
      pardon; and Attila was considered by his subjects as a just and
      indulgent master. He delighted in war; but, after he had ascended
      the throne in a mature age, his head, rather than his hand,
      achieved the conquest of the North; and the fame of an
      adventurous soldier was usefully exchanged for that of a prudent
      and successful general. The effects of personal valor are so
      inconsiderable, except in poetry or romance, that victory, even
      among Barbarians, must depend on the degree of skill with which
      the passions of the multitude are combined and guided for the
      service of a single man. The Scythian conquerors, Attila and
      Zingis, surpassed their rude countrymen in art rather than in
      courage; and it may be observed that the monarchies, both of the
      Huns and of the Moguls, were erected by their founders on the
      basis of popular superstition. The miraculous conception, which
      fraud and credulity ascribed to the virgin-mother of Zingis,
      raised him above the level of human nature; and the naked
      prophet, who in the name of the Deity invested him with the
      empire of the earth, pointed the valor of the Moguls with
      irresistible enthusiasm. 7 The religious arts of Attila were not
      less skillfully adapted to the character of his age and country.
      It was natural enough that the Scythians should adore, with
      peculiar devotion, the god of war; but as they were incapable of
      forming either an abstract idea, or a corporeal representation,
      they worshipped their tutelar deity under the symbol of an iron
      cimeter. 8 One of the shepherds of the Huns perceived, that a
      heifer, who was grazing, had wounded herself in the foot, and
      curiously followed the track of the blood, till he discovered,
      among the long grass, the point of an ancient sword, which he dug
      out of the ground and presented to Attila. That magnanimous, or
      rather that artful, prince accepted, with pious gratitude, this
      celestial favor; and, as the rightful possessor of the sword of
      Mars, asserted his divine and indefeasible claim to the dominion
      of the earth. 9 If the rites of Scythia were practised on this
      solemn occasion, a lofty altar, or rather pile of fagots, three
      hundred yards in length and in breadth, was raised in a spacious
      plain; and the sword of Mars was placed erect on the summit of
      this rustic altar, which was annually consecrated by the blood of
      sheep, horses, and of the hundredth captive. 10 Whether human
      sacrifices formed any part of the worship of Attila, or whether
      he propitiated the god of war with the victims which he
      continually offered in the field of battle, the favorite of Mars
      soon acquired a sacred character, which rendered his conquests more
      easy and more permanent; and the Barbarian princes confessed, in
      the language of devotion or flattery, that they could not presume
      to gaze, with a steady eye, on the divine majesty of the king of
      the Huns. 11 His brother Bleda, who reigned over a considerable
      part of the nation, was compelled to resign his sceptre and his
      life. Yet even this cruel act was attributed to a supernatural
      impulse; and the vigor with which Attila wielded the sword of
      Mars, convinced the world that it had been reserved alone for his
      invincible arm. 12 But the extent of his empire affords the only
      remaining evidence of the number and importance of his victories;
      and the Scythian monarch, however ignorant of the value of
      science and philosophy, might perhaps lament that his illiterate
      subjects were destitute of the art which could perpetuate the
      memory of his exploits.

      testimony of Jornandes, and the contemporary Chronicles.]

      If a line of separation were drawn between the civilized and the
      savage climates of the globe; between the inhabitants of cities,
      who cultivated the earth, and the hunters and shepherds, who
      dwelt in tents, Attila might aspire to the title of supreme and
      sole monarch of the Barbarians. 13 He alone, among the conquerors
      of ancient and modern times, united the two mighty kingdoms of
      Germany and Scythia; and those vague appellations, when they are
      applied to his reign, may be understood with an ample latitude.
      Thuringia, which stretched beyond its actual limits as far as the
      Danube, was in the number of his provinces; he interposed, with
      the weight of a powerful neighbor, in the domestic affairs of the
      Franks; and one of his lieutenants chastised, and almost
      exterminated, the Burgundians of the Rhine.

      He subdued the islands of the ocean, the kingdoms of Scandinavia,
      encompassed and divided by the waters of the Baltic; and the Huns
      might derive a tribute of furs from that northern region, which
      has been protected from all other conquerors by the severity of
      the climate, and the courage of the natives. Towards the East, it
      is difficult to circumscribe the dominion of Attila over the
      Scythian deserts; yet we may be assured, that he reigned on the
      banks of the Volga; that the king of the Huns was dreaded, not
      only as a warrior, but as a magician; 14 that he insulted and
      vanquished the khan of the formidable Geougen; and that he sent
      ambassadors to negotiate an equal alliance with the empire of
      China. In the proud review of the nations who acknowledged the
      sovereignty of Attila, and who never entertained, during his
      lifetime, the thought of a revolt, the Gepidae and the Ostrogoths
      were distinguished by their numbers, their bravery, and the
      personal merits of their chiefs. The renowned Ardaric, king of
      the Gepidae, was the faithful and sagacious counsellor of the
      monarch, who esteemed his intrepid genius, whilst he loved the
      mild and discreet virtues of the noble Walamir, king of the
      Ostrogoths. The crowd of vulgar kings, the leaders of so many
      martial tribes, who served under the standard of Attila, were
      ranged in the submissive order of guards and domestics round the
      person of their master. They watched his nod; they trembled at
      his frown; and at the first signal of his will, they executed,
      without murmur or hesitation, his stern and absolute commands. In
      time of peace, the dependent princes, with their national troops,
      attended the royal camp in regular succession; but when Attila
      collected his military force, he was able to bring into the field
      an army of five, or, according to another account, of seven
      hundred thousand Barbarians. 15

     font trop attendre, et qu’Attila s’ennuie.

      The two kings of the Gepidae and the Ostrogoths are profound
      politicians and sentimental lovers, and the whole piece exhibits
      the defects without the genius, of the poet.]

      The ambassadors of the Huns might awaken the attention of
      Theodosius, by reminding him that they were his neighbors both in
      Europe and Asia; since they touched the Danube on one hand, and
      reached, with the other, as far as the Tanais. In the reign of
      his father Arcadius, a band of adventurous Huns had ravaged the
      provinces of the East; from whence they brought away rich spoils
      and innumerable captives. 16 They advanced, by a secret path,
      along the shores of the Caspian Sea; traversed the snowy
      mountains of Armenia; passed the Tigris, the Euphrates, and the
      Halys; recruited their weary cavalry with the generous breed of
      Cappadocian horses; occupied the hilly country of Cilicia, and
      disturbed the festal songs and dances of the citizens of Antioch.
      Egypt trembled at their approach; and the monks and pilgrims of
      the Holy Land prepared to escape their fury by a speedy
      embarkation. The memory of this invasion was still recent in the
      minds of the Orientals. The subjects of Attila might execute,
      with superior forces, the design which these adventurers had so
      boldly attempted; and it soon became the subject of anxious
      conjecture, whether the tempest would fall on the dominions of
      Rome, or of Persia. Some of the great vassals of the king of the
      Huns, who were themselves in the rank of powerful princes, had
      been sent to ratify an alliance and society of arms with the
      emperor, or rather with the general of the West. They related,
      during their residence at Rome, the circumstances of an
      expedition, which they had lately made into the East. After
      passing a desert and a morass, supposed by the Romans to be the
      Lake Maeotis, they penetrated through the mountains, and arrived,
      at the end of fifteen days’ march, on the confines of Media;
      where they advanced as far as the unknown cities of Basic and
      Cursic. 1611 They encountered the Persian army in the plains of
      Media and the air, according to their own expression, was
      darkened by a cloud of arrows. But the Huns were obliged to
      retire before the numbers of the enemy. Their laborious retreat
      was effected by a different road; they lost the greatest part of
      their booty; and at length returned to the royal camp, with some
      knowledge of the country, and an impatient desire of revenge. In
      the free conversation of the Imperial ambassadors, who discussed,
      at the court of Attila, the character and designs of their
      formidable enemy, the ministers of Constantinople expressed their
      hope, that his strength might be diverted and employed in a long
      and doubtful contest with the princes of the house of Sassan. The
      more sagacious Italians admonished their Eastern brethren of the
      folly and danger of such a hope; and convinced them, that the
      Medes and Persians were incapable of resisting the arms of the
      Huns; and that the easy and important acquisition would exalt the
      pride, as well as power, of the conqueror. Instead of contenting
      himself with a moderate contribution, and a military title, which
      equalled him only to the generals of Theodosius, Attila would
      proceed to impose a disgraceful and intolerable yoke on the necks
      of the prostrate and captive Romans, who would then be
      encompassed, on all sides, by the empire of the Huns. 17

      While the powers of Europe and Asia were solicitous to avert the
      impending danger, the alliance of Attila maintained the Vandals
      in the possession of Africa. An enterprise had been concerted
      between the courts of Ravenna and Constantinople, for the
      recovery of that valuable province; and the ports of Sicily were
      already filled with the military and naval forces of Theodosius.
      But the subtle Genseric, who spread his negotiations round the
      world, prevented their designs, by exciting the king of the Huns
      to invade the Eastern empire; and a trifling incident soon became
      the motive, or pretence, of a destructive war. 18 Under the faith
      of the treaty of Margus, a free market was held on the Northern
      side of the Danube, which was protected by a Roman fortress
      surnamed Constantia. A troop of Barbarians violated the
      commercial security; killed, or dispersed, the unsuspecting
      traders; and levelled the fortress with the ground. The Huns
      justified this outrage as an act of reprisal; alleged, that the
      bishop of Margus had entered their territories, to discover and
      steal a secret treasure of their kings; and sternly demanded the
      guilty prelate, the sacrilegious spoil, and the fugitive
      subjects, who had escaped from the justice of Attila. The refusal
      of the Byzantine court was the signal of war; and the Maesians at
      first applauded the generous firmness of their sovereign. But
      they were soon intimidated by the destruction of Viminiacum and
      the adjacent towns; and the people was persuaded to adopt the
      convenient maxim, that a private citizen, however innocent or
      respectable, may be justly sacrificed to the safety of his
      country. The bishop of Margus, who did not possess the spirit of
      a martyr, resolved to prevent the designs which he suspected. He
      boldly treated with the princes of the Huns: secured, by solemn
      oaths, his pardon and reward; posted a numerous detachment of
      Barbarians, in silent ambush, on the banks of the Danube; and, at
      the appointed hour, opened, with his own hand, the gates of his
      episcopal city. This advantage, which had been obtained by
      treachery, served as a prelude to more honorable and decisive
      victories. The Illyrian frontier was covered by a line of castles
      and fortresses; and though the greatest part of them consisted
      only of a single tower, with a small garrison, they were commonly
      sufficient to repel, or to intercept, the inroads of an enemy,
      who was ignorant of the art, and impatient of the delay, of a
      regular siege. But these slight obstacles were instantly swept
      away by the inundation of the Huns. 19 They destroyed, with fire
      and sword, the populous cities of Sirmium and Singidunum, of
      Ratiaria and Marcianopolis, of Naissus and Sardica; where every
      circumstance of the discipline of the people, and the
      construction of the buildings, had been gradually adapted to the
      sole purpose of defence. The whole breadth of Europe, as it
      extends above five hundred miles from the Euxine to the
      Hadriatic, was at once invaded, and occupied, and desolated, by
      the myriads of Barbarians whom Attila led into the field. The
      public danger and distress could not, however, provoke Theodosius
      to interrupt his amusements and devotion, or to appear in person
      at the head of the Roman legions. But the troops, which had been
      sent against Genseric, were hastily recalled from Sicily; the
      garrisons, on the side of Persia, were exhausted; and a military
      force was collected in Europe, formidable by their arms and
      numbers, if the generals had understood the science of command,
      and the soldiers the duty of obedience. The armies of the Eastern
      empire were vanquished in three successive engagements; and the
      progress of Attila may be traced by the fields of battle.

      The two former, on the banks of the Utus, and under the walls of
      Marcianopolis, were fought in the extensive plains between the
      Danube and Mount Haemus. As the Romans were pressed by a
      victorious enemy, they gradually, and unskilfully, retired
      towards the Chersonesus of Thrace; and that narrow peninsula, the
      last extremity of the land, was marked by their third, and
      irreparable, defeat. By the destruction of this army, Attila
      acquired the indisputable possession of the field. From the
      Hellespont to Thermopylae, and the suburbs of Constantinople, he
      ravaged, without resistance, and without mercy, the provinces of
      Thrace and Macedonia. Heraclea and Hadrianople might, perhaps,
      escape this dreadful irruption of the Huns; but the words, the
      most expressive of total extirpation and erasure, are applied to
      the calamities which they inflicted on seventy cities of the
      Eastern empire. 20 Theodosius, his court, and the unwarlike
      people, were protected by the walls of Constantinople; but those
      walls had been shaken by a recent earthquake, and the fall of
      fifty-eight towers had opened a large and tremendous breach. The
      damage indeed was speedily repaired; but this accident was
      aggravated by a superstitious fear, that Heaven itself had
      delivered the Imperial city to the shepherds of Scythia, who were
      strangers to the laws, the language, and the religion, of the
      Romans. 21

      of a popular preacher, an earthquake is an engine of admirable
      effect.]

      In all their invasions of the civilized empires of the South, the
      Scythian shepherds have been uniformly actuated by a savage and
      destructive spirit. The laws of war, that restrain the exercise
      of national rapine and murder, are founded on two principles of
      substantial interest: the knowledge of the permanent benefits
      which may be obtained by a moderate use of conquest; and a just
      apprehension, lest the desolation which we inflict on the enemy’s
      country may be retaliated on our own. But these considerations of
      hope and fear are almost unknown in the pastoral state of
      nations. The Huns of Attila may, without injustice, be compared
      to the Moguls and Tartars, before their primitive manners were
      changed by religion and luxury; and the evidence of Oriental
      history may reflect some light on the short and imperfect annals
      of Rome. After the Moguls had subdued the northern provinces of
      China, it was seriously proposed, not in the hour of victory and
      passion, but in calm deliberate council, to exterminate all the
      inhabitants of that populous country, that the vacant land might
      be converted to the pasture of cattle. The firmness of a Chinese
      mandarin, 22 who insinuated some principles of rational policy
      into the mind of Zingis, diverted him from the execution of this
      horrid design. But in the cities of Asia, which yielded to the
      Moguls, the inhuman abuse of the rights of war was exercised with
      a regular form of discipline, which may, with equal reason,
      though not with equal authority, be imputed to the victorious
      Huns. The inhabitants, who had submitted to their discretion,
      were ordered to evacuate their houses, and to assemble in some
      plain adjacent to the city; where a division was made of the
      vanquished into three parts. The first class consisted of the
      soldiers of the garrison, and of the young men capable of bearing
      arms; and their fate was instantly decided: they were either
      enlisted among the Moguls, or they were massacred on the spot by
      the troops, who, with pointed spears and bended bows, had formed
      a circle round the captive multitude. The second class, composed
      of the young and beautiful women, of the artificers of every rank
      and profession, and of the more wealthy or honorable citizens,
      from whom a private ransom might be expected, was distributed in
      equal or proportionable lots. The remainder, whose life or death
      was alike useless to the conquerors, were permitted to return to
      the city; which, in the mean while, had been stripped of its
      valuable furniture; and a tax was imposed on those wretched
      inhabitants for the indulgence of breathing their native air.
      Such was the behavior of the Moguls, when they were not conscious
      of any extraordinary rigor. 23 But the most casual provocation,
      the slightest motive of caprice or convenience, often provoked
      them to involve a whole people in an indiscriminate massacre; and
      the ruin of some flourishing cities was executed with such
      unrelenting perseverance, that, according to their own
      expression, horses might run, without stumbling, over the ground
      where they had once stood. The three great capitals of Khorasan,
      Maru, Neisabour, and Herat, were destroyed by the armies of
      Zingis; and the exact account which was taken of the slain
      amounted to four millions three hundred and forty-seven thousand
      persons. 24 Timur, or Tamerlane, was educated in a less barbarous
      age, and in the profession of the Mahometan religion; yet, if
      Attila equalled the hostile ravages of Tamerlane, 25 either the
      Tartar or the Hun might deserve the epithet of the Scourge of
      God. 26

      Chapter XXXIV: Attila.—Part II.

      It may be affirmed, with bolder assurance, that the Huns
      depopulated the provinces of the empire, by the number of Roman
      subjects whom they led away into captivity. In the hands of a
      wise legislator, such an industrious colony might have
      contributed to diffuse through the deserts of Scythia the
      rudiments of the useful and ornamental arts; but these captives,
      who had been taken in war, were accidentally dispersed among the
      hordes that obeyed the empire of Attila. The estimate of their
      respective value was formed by the simple judgment of
      unenlightened and unprejudiced Barbarians. Perhaps they might not
      understand the merit of a theologian, profoundly skilled in the
      controversies of the Trinity and the Incarnation; yet they
      respected the ministers of every religion; and the active zeal of
      the Christian missionaries, without approaching the person or the
      palace of the monarch, successfully labored in the propagation of
      the gospel. 27 The pastoral tribes, who were ignorant of the
      distinction of landed property, must have disregarded the use, as
      well as the abuse, of civil jurisprudence; and the skill of an
      eloquent lawyer could excite only their contempt or their
      abhorrence. 28 The perpetual intercourse of the Huns and the
      Goths had communicated the familiar knowledge of the two national
      dialects; and the Barbarians were ambitious of conversing in
      Latin, the military idiom even of the Eastern empire. 29 But they
      disdained the language and the sciences of the Greeks; and the
      vain sophist, or grave philosopher, who had enjoyed the
      flattering applause of the schools, was mortified to find that
      his robust servant was a captive of more value and importance
      than himself. The mechanic arts were encouraged and esteemed, as
      they tended to satisfy the wants of the Huns. An architect in the
      service of Onegesius, one of the favorites of Attila, was
      employed to construct a bath; but this work was a rare example of
      private luxury; and the trades of the smith, the carpenter, the
      armorer, were much more adapted to supply a wandering people with
      the useful instruments of peace and war. But the merit of the
      physician was received with universal favor and respect: the
      Barbarians, who despised death, might be apprehensive of disease;
      and the haughty conqueror trembled in the presence of a captive,
      to whom he ascribed, perhaps, an imaginary power of prolonging or
      preserving his life. 30 The Huns might be provoked to insult the
      misery of their slaves, over whom they exercised a despotic
      command; 31 but their manners were not susceptible of a refined
      system of oppression; and the efforts of courage and diligence
      were often recompensed by the gift of freedom. The historian
      Priscus, whose embassy is a source of curious instruction, was
      accosted in the camp of Attila by a stranger, who saluted him in
      the Greek language, but whose dress and figure displayed the
      appearance of a wealthy Scythian. In the siege of Viminiacum, he
      had lost, according to his own account, his fortune and liberty;
      he became the slave of Onegesius; but his faithful services,
      against the Romans and the Acatzires, had gradually raised him to
      the rank of the native Huns; to whom he was attached by the
      domestic pledges of a new wife and several children. The spoils
      of war had restored and improved his private property; he was
      admitted to the table of his former lord; and the apostate Greek
      blessed the hour of his captivity, since it had been the
      introduction to a happy and independent state; which he held by
      the honorable tenure of military service. This reflection
      naturally produced a dispute on the advantages and defects of the
      Roman government, which was severely arraigned by the apostate,
      and defended by Priscus in a prolix and feeble declamation. The
      freedman of Onegesius exposed, in true and lively colors, the
      vices of a declining empire, of which he had so long been the
      victim; the cruel absurdity of the Roman princes, unable to
      protect their subjects against the public enemy, unwilling to
      trust them with arms for their own defence; the intolerable
      weight of taxes, rendered still more oppressive by the intricate
      or arbitrary modes of collection; the obscurity of numerous and
      contradictory laws; the tedious and expensive forms of judicial
      proceedings; the partial administration of justice; and the
      universal corruption, which increased the influence of the rich,
      and aggravated the misfortunes of the poor. A sentiment of
      patriotic sympathy was at length revived in the breast of the
      fortunate exile; and he lamented, with a flood of tears, the
      guilt or weakness of those magistrates who had perverted the
      wisest and most salutary institutions. 32

      32 (return) [ See the whole conversation in Priscus, p. 59-62.]

      The timid or selfish policy of the Western Romans had abandoned
      the Eastern empire to the Huns. 33 The loss of armies, and the
      want of discipline or virtue, were not supplied by the personal
      character of the monarch. Theodosius might still affect the
      style, as well as the title, of Invincible Augustus; but he was
      reduced to solicit the clemency of Attila, who imperiously
      dictated these harsh and humiliating conditions of peace. I. The
      emperor of the East resigned, by an express or tacit convention,
      an extensive and important territory, which stretched along the
      southern banks of the Danube, from Singidunum, or Belgrade, as
      far as Novae, in the diocese of Thrace. The breadth was defined
      by the vague computation of fifteen 3311 days’ journey; but, from
      the proposal of Attila to remove the situation of the national
      market, it soon appeared, that he comprehended the ruined city of
      Naissus within the limits of his dominions. II. The king of the
      Huns required and obtained, that his tribute or subsidy should be
      augmented from seven hundred pounds of gold to the annual sum of
      two thousand one hundred; and he stipulated the immediate payment
      of six thousand pounds of gold, to defray the expenses, or to
      expiate the guilt, of the war. One might imagine, that such a
      demand, which scarcely equalled the measure of private wealth,
      would have been readily discharged by the opulent empire of the
      East; and the public distress affords a remarkable proof of the
      impoverished, or at least of the disorderly, state of the
      finances. A large proportion of the taxes extorted from the
      people was detained and intercepted in their passage, though the
      foulest channels, to the treasury of Constantinople. The revenue
      was dissipated by Theodosius and his favorites in wasteful and
      profuse luxury; which was disguised by the names of Imperial
      magnificence, or Christian charity. The immediate supplies had
      been exhausted by the unforeseen necessity of military
      preparations. A personal contribution, rigorously, but
      capriciously, imposed on the members of the senatorian order, was
      the only expedient that could disarm, without loss of time, the
      impatient avarice of Attila; and the poverty of the nobles
      compelled them to adopt the scandalous resource of exposing to
      public auction the jewels of their wives, and the hereditary
      ornaments of their palaces. 34 III. The king of the Huns appears
      to have established, as a principle of national jurisprudence,
      that he could never lose the property, which he had once
      acquired, in the persons who had yielded either a voluntary, or
      reluctant, submission to his authority. From this principle he
      concluded, and the conclusions of Attila were irrevocable laws,
      that the Huns, who had been taken prisoner in war, should be
      released without delay, and without ransom; that every Roman
      captive, who had presumed to escape, should purchase his right to
      freedom at the price of twelve pieces of gold; and that all the
      Barbarians, who had deserted the standard of Attila, should be
      restored, without any promise or stipulation of pardon.

      In the execution of this cruel and ignominious treaty, the
      Imperial officers were forced to massacre several loyal and noble
      deserters, who refused to devote themselves to certain death; and
      the Romans forfeited all reasonable claims to the friendship of
      any Scythian people, by this public confession, that they were
      destitute either of faith, or power, to protect the suppliant,
      who had embraced the throne of Theodosius. 35

      1. That Attila himself solicited the peace and presents, which he
      had formerly refused; and, 2dly, That, about the same time, the
      ambassadors of India presented a fine large tame tiger to the
      emperor Theodosius.]

      The firmness of a single town, so obscure, that, except on this
      occasion, it has never been mentioned by any historian or
      geographer, exposed the disgrace of the emperor and empire.
      Azimus, or Azimuntium, a small city of Thrace on the Illyrian
      borders, 36 had been distinguished by the martial spirit of its
      youth, the skill and reputation of the leaders whom they had
      chosen, and their daring exploits against the innumerable host of
      the Barbarians. Instead of tamely expecting their approach, the
      Azimuntines attacked, in frequent and successful sallies, the
      troops of the Huns, who gradually declined the dangerous
      neighborhood, rescued from their hands the spoil and the
      captives, and recruited their domestic force by the voluntary
      association of fugitives and deserters. After the conclusion of
      the treaty, Attila still menaced the empire with implacable war,
      unless the Azimuntines were persuaded, or compelled, to comply
      with the conditions which their sovereign had accepted. The
      ministers of Theodosius confessed with shame, and with truth,
      that they no longer possessed any authority over a society of
      men, who so bravely asserted their natural independence; and the
      king of the Huns condescended to negotiate an equal exchange with
      the citizens of Azimus. They demanded the restitution of some
      shepherds, who, with their cattle, had been accidentally
      surprised. A strict, though fruitless, inquiry was allowed: but
      the Huns were obliged to swear, that they did not detain any
      prisoners belonging to the city, before they could recover two
      surviving countrymen, whom the Azimuntines had reserved as
      pledges for the safety of their lost companions. Attila, on his
      side, was satisfied, and deceived, by their solemn asseveration,
      that the rest of the captives had been put to the sword; and that
      it was their constant practice, immediately to dismiss the Romans
      and the deserters, who had obtained the security of the public
      faith. This prudent and officious dissimulation may be condemned,
      or excused, by the casuists, as they incline to the rigid decree
      of St. Augustin, or to the milder sentiment of St. Jerom and St.
      Chrysostom: but every soldier, every statesman, must acknowledge,
      that, if the race of the Azimuntines had been encouraged and
      multiplied, the Barbarians would have ceased to trample on the
      majesty of the empire. 37

      quarrel of the two apostles, St. Peter and St. Paul, depends on
      the solution of an important question, (Middleton’s Works, vol.
      ii. p. 5-20,) which has been frequently agitated by Catholic and
      Protestant divines, and even by lawyers and philosophers of every
      age.]

      It would have been strange, indeed, if Theodosius had purchased,
      by the loss of honor, a secure and solid tranquillity, or if his
      tameness had not invited the repetition of injuries. The
      Byzantine court was insulted by five or six successive embassies;
      38 and the ministers of Attila were uniformly instructed to press
      the tardy or imperfect execution of the last treaty; to produce
      the names of fugitives and deserters, who were still protected by
      the empire; and to declare, with seeming moderation, that, unless
      their sovereign obtained complete and immediate satisfaction, it
      would be impossible for him, were it even his wish, to check the
      resentment of his warlike tribes. Besides the motives of pride
      and interest, which might prompt the king of the Huns to continue
      this train of negotiation, he was influenced by the less
      honorable view of enriching his favorites at the expense of his
      enemies. The Imperial treasury was exhausted, to procure the
      friendly offices of the ambassadors and their principal
      attendants, whose favorable report might conduce to the
      maintenance of peace. The Barbarian monarch was flattered by the
      liberal reception of his ministers; he computed, with pleasure,
      the value and splendor of their gifts, rigorously exacted the
      performance of every promise which would contribute to their
      private emolument, and treated as an important business of state
      the marriage of his secretary Constantius. 39 That Gallic
      adventurer, who was recommended by Ætius to the king of the
      Huns, had engaged his service to the ministers of Constantinople,
      for the stipulated reward of a wealthy and noble wife; and the
      daughter of Count Saturninus was chosen to discharge the
      obligations of her country. The reluctance of the victim, some
      domestic troubles, and the unjust confiscation of her fortune,
      cooled the ardor of her interested lover; but he still demanded,
      in the name of Attila, an equivalent alliance; and, after many
      ambiguous delays and excuses, the Byzantine court was compelled
      to sacrifice to this insolent stranger the widow of Armatius,
      whose birth, opulence, and beauty, placed her in the most
      illustrious rank of the Roman matrons. For these importunate and
      oppressive embassies, Attila claimed a suitable return: he
      weighed, with suspicious pride, the character and station of the
      Imperial envoys; but he condescended to promise that he would
      advance as far as Sardica to receive any ministers who had been
      invested with the consular dignity. The council of Theodosius
      eluded this proposal, by representing the desolate and ruined
      condition of Sardica, and even ventured to insinuate that every
      officer of the army or household was qualified to treat with the
      most powerful princes of Scythia. Maximin, 40 a respectable
      courtier, whose abilities had been long exercised in civil and
      military employments, accepted, with reluctance, the troublesome,
      and perhaps dangerous, commission of reconciling the angry spirit
      of the king of the Huns. His friend, the historian Priscus, 41
      embraced the opportunity of observing the Barbarian hero in the
      peaceful and domestic scenes of life: but the secret of the
      embassy, a fatal and guilty secret, was intrusted only to the
      interpreter Vigilius. The two last ambassadors of the Huns,
      Orestes, a noble subject of the Pannonian province, and Edecon, a
      valiant chieftain of the tribe of the Scyrri, returned at the
      same time from Constantinople to the royal camp. Their obscure
      names were afterwards illustrated by the extraordinary fortune
      and the contrast of their sons: the two servants of Attila became
      the fathers of the last Roman emperor of the West, and of the
      first Barbarian king of Italy.

      Fragments of Priscus, which have been too much disregarded.]

      name of Constantius, who, from the similar events of their lives,
      might have been easily confounded.]

      throne, the office of Great Chamberlain was bestowed on Maximin,
      who is ranked, in the public edict, among the four principal
      ministers of state, (Novell. ad Calc. Cod. Theod. p. 31.) He
      executed a civil and military commission in the Eastern
      provinces; and his death was lamented by the savages of
      Æthiopia, whose incursions he had repressed. See Priscus, p. 40,

      The ambassadors, who were followed by a numerous train of men and
      horses, made their first halt at Sardica, at the distance of
      three hundred and fifty miles, or thirteen days’ journey, from
      Constantinople. As the remains of Sardica were still included
      within the limits of the empire, it was incumbent on the Romans
      to exercise the duties of hospitality. They provided, with the
      assistance of the provincials, a sufficient number of sheep and
      oxen, and invited the Huns to a splendid, or at least, a
      plentiful supper. But the harmony of the entertainment was soon
      disturbed by mutual prejudice and indiscretion. The greatness of
      the emperor and the empire was warmly maintained by their
      ministers; the Huns, with equal ardor, asserted the superiority
      of their victorious monarch: the dispute was inflamed by the rash
      and unseasonable flattery of Vigilius, who passionately rejected
      the comparison of a mere mortal with the divine Theodosius; and
      it was with extreme difficulty that Maximin and Priscus were able
      to divert the conversation, or to soothe the angry minds, of the
      Barbarians. When they rose from table, the Imperial ambassador
      presented Edecon and Orestes with rich gifts of silk robes and
      Indian pearls, which they thankfully accepted. Yet Orestes could
      not forbear insinuating that he had not always been treated with
      such respect and liberality: and the offensive distinction which
      was implied, between his civil office and the hereditary rank of
      his colleague seems to have made Edecon a doubtful friend, and
      Orestes an irreconcilable enemy. After this entertainment, they
      travelled about one hundred miles from Sardica to Naissus. That
      flourishing city, which has given birth to the great Constantine,
      was levelled with the ground: the inhabitants were destroyed or
      dispersed; and the appearance of some sick persons, who were
      still permitted to exist among the ruins of the churches, served
      only to increase the horror of the prospect. The surface of the
      country was covered with the bones of the slain; and the
      ambassadors, who directed their course to the north-west, were
      obliged to pass the hills of modern Servia, before they descended
      into the flat and marshy grounds which are terminated by the
      Danube. The Huns were masters of the great river: their
      navigation was performed in large canoes, hollowed out of the
      trunk of a single tree; the ministers of Theodosius were safely
      landed on the opposite bank; and their Barbarian associates
      immediately hastened to the camp of Attila, which was equally
      prepared for the amusements of hunting or of war. No sooner had
      Maximin advanced about two miles 4111 from the Danube, than he
      began to experience the fastidious insolence of the conqueror. He
      was sternly forbid to pitch his tents in a pleasant valley, lest
      he should infringe the distant awe that was due to the royal
      mansion. 4112 The ministers of Attila pressed them to communicate
      the business, and the instructions, which he reserved for the ear
      of their sovereign. When Maximin temperately urged the contrary
      practice of nations, he was still more confounded to find that
      the resolutions of the Sacred Consistory, those secrets (says
      Priscus) which should not be revealed to the gods themselves, had
      been treacherously disclosed to the public enemy. On his refusal
      to comply with such ignominious terms, the Imperial envoy was
      commanded instantly to depart; the order was recalled; it was
      again repeated; and the Huns renewed their ineffectual attempts
      to subdue the patient firmness of Maximin. At length, by the
      intercession of Scotta, the brother of Onegesius, whose
      friendship had been purchased by a liberal gift, he was admitted
      to the royal presence; but, instead of obtaining a decisive
      answer, he was compelled to undertake a remote journey towards
      the north, that Attila might enjoy the proud satisfaction of
      receiving, in the same camp, the ambassadors of the Eastern and
      Western empires. His journey was regulated by the guides, who
      obliged him to halt, to hasten his march, or to deviate from the
      common road, as it best suited the convenience of the king. The
      Romans, who traversed the plains of Hungary, suppose that they
      passed several navigable rivers, either in canoes or portable
      boats; but there is reason to suspect that the winding stream of
      the Teyss, or Tibiscus, might present itself in different places
      under different names. From the contiguous villages they received
      a plentiful and regular supply of provisions; mead instead of
      wine, millet in the place of bread, and a certain liquor named
      camus, which according to the report of Priscus, was distilled
      from barley. 42 Such fare might appear coarse and indelicate to
      men who had tasted the luxury of Constantinople; but, in their
      accidental distress, they were relieved by the gentleness and
      hospitality of the same Barbarians, so terrible and so merciless
      in war. The ambassadors had encamped on the edge of a large
      morass. A violent tempest of wind and rain, of thunder and
      lightning, overturned their tents, immersed their baggage and
      furniture in the water, and scattered their retinue, who wandered
      in the darkness of the night, uncertain of their road, and
      apprehensive of some unknown danger, till they awakened by their
      cries the inhabitants of a neighboring village, the property of
      the widow of Bleda. A bright illumination, and, in a few moments,
      a comfortable fire of reeds, was kindled by their officious
      benevolence; the wants, and even the desires, of the Romans were
      liberally satisfied; and they seem to have been embarrassed by
      the singular politeness of Bleda’s widow, who added to her other
      favors the gift, or at least the loan, of a sufficient number of
      beautiful and obsequious damsels. The sunshine of the succeeding
      day was dedicated to repose, to collect and dry the baggage, and
      to the refreshment of the men and horses: but, in the evening,
      before they pursued their journey, the ambassadors expressed
      their gratitude to the bounteous lady of the village, by a very
      acceptable present of silver cups, red fleeces, dried fruits, and
      Indian pepper. Soon after this adventure, they rejoined the march
      of Attila, from whom they had been separated about six days, and
      slowly proceeded to the capital of an empire, which did not
      contain, in the space of several thousand miles, a single city.

      4112 (return) [ He was forbidden to pitch his tents on an
      eminence because Attila’s were below on the plain. Ibid.—M.]

      42 (return) [ The Huns themselves still continued to despise the
      labors of agriculture: they abused the privilege of a victorious
      nation; and the Goths, their industrious subjects, who cultivated
      the earth, dreaded their neighborhood, like that of so many
      ravenous wolves, (Priscus, p. 45.) In the same manner the Sarts
      and Tadgics provide for their own subsistence, and for that of
      the Usbec Tartars, their lazy and rapacious sovereigns. See
      Genealogical History of the Tartars, p. 423 455, &c.]

      As far as we may ascertain the vague and obscure geography of
      Priscus, this capital appears to have been seated between the
      Danube, the Teyss, and the Carpathian hills, in the plains of
      Upper Hungary, and most probably in the neighborhood of Jezberin,
      Agria, or Tokay. 43 In its origin it could be no more than an
      accidental camp, which, by the long and frequent residence of
      Attila, had insensibly swelled into a huge village, for the
      reception of his court, of the troops who followed his person,
      and of the various multitude of idle or industrious slaves and
      retainers. 44 The baths, constructed by Onegesius, were the only
      edifice of stone; the materials had been transported from
      Pannonia; and since the adjacent country was destitute even of
      large timber, it may be presumed, that the meaner habitations of
      the royal village consisted of straw, or mud, or of canvass. The
      wooden houses of the more illustrious Huns were built and adorned
      with rude magnificence, according to the rank, the fortune, or
      the taste of the proprietors. They seem to have been distributed
      with some degree of order and symmetry; and each spot became more
      honorable as it approached the person of the sovereign. The
      palace of Attila, which surpassed all other houses in his
      dominions, was built entirely of wood, and covered an ample space
      of ground. The outward enclosure was a lofty wall, or palisade,
      of smooth square timber, intersected with high towers, but
      intended rather for ornament than defence. This wall, which seems
      to have encircled the declivity of a hill, comprehended a great
      variety of wooden edifices, adapted to the uses of royalty.

      A separate house was assigned to each of the numerous wives of
      Attila; and, instead of the rigid and illiberal confinement
      imposed by Asiatic jealousy they politely admitted the Roman
      ambassadors to their presence, their table, and even to the
      freedom of an innocent embrace. When Maximin offered his presents
      to Cerca, 4411 the principal queen, he admired the singular
      architecture on her mansion, the height of the round columns, the
      size and beauty of the wood, which was curiously shaped or turned
      or polished or carved; and his attentive eye was able to discover
      some taste in the ornaments and some regularity in the
      proportions. After passing through the guards, who watched before
      the gate, the ambassadors were introduced into the private
      apartment of Cerca. The wife of Attila received their visit
      sitting, or rather lying, on a soft couch; the floor was covered
      with a carpet; the domestics formed a circle round the queen; and
      her damsels, seated on the ground, were employed in working the
      variegated embroidery which adorned the dress of the Barbaric
      warriors. The Huns were ambitious of displaying those riches
      which were the fruit and evidence of their victories: the
      trappings of their horses, their swords, and even their shoes,
      were studded with gold and precious stones; and their tables were
      profusely spread with plates, and goblets, and vases of gold and
      silver, which had been fashioned by the labor of Grecian artists.

      The monarch alone assumed the superior pride of still adhering to
      the simplicity of his Scythian ancestors. 45 The dress of Attila,
      his arms, and the furniture of his horse, were plain, without
      ornament, and of a single color. The royal table was served in
      wooden cups and platters; flesh was his only food; and the
      conqueror of the North never tasted the luxury of bread.

      43 (return) [ It is evident that Priscus passed the Danube and
      the Teyss, and that he did not reach the foot of the Carpathian
      hills. Agria, Tokay, and Jazberin, are situated in the plains
      circumscribed by this definition. M. de Buat (Histoire des
      Peuples, &c., tom. vii. p. 461) has chosen Tokay; Otrokosci, (p.
      180, apud Mascou, ix. 23,) a learned Hungarian, has preferred
      Jazberin, a place about thirty-six miles westward of Buda and the
      Danube. * Note: M. St. Martin considers the narrative of Priscus,
      the only authority of M. de Buat and of Gibbon, too vague to fix
      the position of Attila’s camp. “It is worthy of remark, that in
      the Hungarian traditions collected by Thwrocz, l. 2, c. 17,
      precisely on the left branch of the Danube, where Attila’s
      residence was situated, in the same parallel stands the present
      city of Buda, in Hungarian Buduvur. It is for this reason that
      this city has retained for a long time among the Germans of
      Hungary the name of Etzelnburgh or Etzela-burgh, i. e., the city
      of Attila. The distance of Buda from the place where Priscus
      crossed the Danube, on his way from Naissus, is equal to that
      which he traversed to reach the residence of the king of the
      Huns. I see no good reason for not acceding to the relations of
      the Hungarian historians.” St. Martin, vi. 191.—M]

      city of Karacorum, the residence of the successors of Zingis;
      which, though it appears to have been a more stable habitation,
      did not equal the size or splendor of the town and abbey of St.
      Denys, in the 13th century. (See Rubruquis, in the Histoire
      Generale des Voyages, tom. vii p. 286.) The camp of Aurengzebe,
      as it is so agreeably described by Bernier, (tom. ii. p.
      217-235,) blended the manners of Scythia with the magnificence
      and luxury of Hindostan.]

      de Gengiscan, v. c. 9.]

      When Attila first gave audience to the Roman ambassadors on the
      banks of the Danube, his tent was encompassed with a formidable
      guard. The monarch himself was seated in a wooden chair. His
      stern countenance, angry gestures, and impatient tone, astonished
      the firmness of Maximin; but Vigilius had more reason to tremble,
      since he distinctly understood the menace, that if Attila did not
      respect the law of nations, he would nail the deceitful
      interpreter to the cross. and leave his body to the vultures. The
      Barbarian condescended, by producing an accurate list, to expose
      the bold falsehood of Vigilius, who had affirmed that no more
      than seventeen deserters could be found. But he arrogantly
      declared, that he apprehended only the disgrace of contending
      with his fugitive slaves; since he despised their impotent
      efforts to defend the provinces which Theodosius had intrusted to
      their arms: “For what fortress,” (added Attila,) “what city, in
      the wide extent of the Roman empire, can hope to exist, secure
      and impregnable, if it is our pleasure that it should be erased
      from the earth?” He dismissed, however, the interpreter, who
      returned to Constantinople with his peremptory demand of more
      complete restitution, and a more splendid embassy.

      His anger gradually subsided, and his domestic satisfaction in a
      marriage which he celebrated on the road with the daughter of
      Eslam, 4511 might perhaps contribute to mollify the native
      fierceness of his temper. The entrance of Attila into the royal
      village was marked by a very singular ceremony. A numerous troop
      of women came out to meet their hero and their king. They marched
      before him, distributed into long and regular files; the
      intervals between the files were filled by white veils of thin
      linen, which the women on either side bore aloft in their hands,
      and which formed a canopy for a chorus of young virgins, who
      chanted hymns and songs in the Scythian language. The wife of his
      favorite Onegesius, with a train of female attendants, saluted
      Attila at the door of her own house, on his way to the palace;
      and offered, according to the custom of the country, her
      respectful homage, by entreating him to taste the wine and meat
      which she had prepared for his reception. As soon as the monarch
      had graciously accepted her hospitable gift, his domestics lifted
      a small silver table to a convenient height, as he sat on
      horseback; and Attila, when he had touched the goblet with his
      lips, again saluted the wife of Onegesius, and continued his
      march. During his residence at the seat of empire, his hours were
      not wasted in the recluse idleness of a seraglio; and the king of
      the Huns could maintain his superior dignity, without concealing
      his person from the public view. He frequently assembled his
      council, and gave audience to the ambassadors of the nations; and
      his people might appeal to the supreme tribunal, which he held at
      stated times, and, according to the Eastern custom, before the
      principal gate of his wooden palace. The Romans, both of the East
      and of the West, were twice invited to the banquets, where Attila
      feasted with the princes and nobles of Scythia. Maximin and his
      colleagues were stopped on the threshold, till they had made a
      devout libation to the health and prosperity of the king of the
      Huns; and were conducted, after this ceremony, to their
      respective seats in a spacious hall. The royal table and couch,
      covered with carpets and fine linen, was raised by several steps
      in the midst of the hall; and a son, an uncle, or perhaps a
      favorite king, were admitted to share the simple and homely
      repast of Attila. Two lines of small tables, each of which
      contained three or four guests, were ranged in order on either
      hand; the right was esteemed the most honorable, but the Romans
      ingenuously confess, that they were placed on the left; and that
      Beric, an unknown chieftain, most probably of the Gothic race,
      preceded the representatives of Theodosius and Valentinian. The
      Barbarian monarch received from his cup-bearer a goblet filled
      with wine, and courteously drank to the health of the most
      distinguished guest; who rose from his seat, and expressed, in
      the same manner, his loyal and respectful vows. This ceremony was
      successively performed for all, or at least for the illustrious
      persons of the assembly; and a considerable time must have been
      consumed, since it was thrice repeated as each course or service
      was placed on the table. But the wine still remained after the
      meat had been removed; and the Huns continued to indulge their
      intemperance long after the sober and decent ambassadors of the
      two empires had withdrawn themselves from the nocturnal banquet.
      Yet before they retired, they enjoyed a singular opportunity of
      observing the manners of the nation in their convivial
      amusements. Two Scythians stood before the couch of Attila, and
      recited the verses which they had composed, to celebrate his
      valor and his victories. 4512 A profound silence prevailed in the
      hall; and the attention of the guests was captivated by the vocal
      harmony, which revived and perpetuated the memory of their own
      exploits; a martial ardor flashed from the eyes of the warriors,
      who were impatient for battle; and the tears of the old men
      expressed their generous despair, that they could no longer
      partake the danger and glory of the field. 46 This entertainment,
      which might be considered as a school of military virtue, was
      succeeded by a farce, that debased the dignity of human nature. A
      Moorish and a Scythian buffoon successively excited the mirth of
      the rude spectators, by their deformed figure, ridiculous dress,
      antic gestures, absurd speeches, and the strange, unintelligible
      confusion of the Latin, the Gothic, and the Hunnic languages; and
      the hall resounded with loud and licentious peals of laughter. In
      the midst of this intemperate riot, Attila alone, without a
      change of countenance, maintained his steadfast and inflexible
      gravity; which was never relaxed, except on the entrance of
      Irnac, the youngest of his sons: he embraced the boy with a smile
      of paternal tenderness, gently pinched him by the cheek, and
      betrayed a partial affection, which was justified by the
      assurance of his prophets, that Irnac would be the future support
      of his family and empire. Two days afterwards, the ambassadors
      received a second invitation; and they had reason to praise the
      politeness, as well as the hospitality, of Attila. The king of
      the Huns held a long and familiar conversation with Maximin; but
      his civility was interrupted by rude expressions and haughty
      reproaches; and he was provoked, by a motive of interest, to
      support, with unbecoming zeal, the private claims of his
      secretary Constantius.

      “The emperor” (said Attila) “has long promised him a rich wife:
      Constantius must not be disappointed; nor should a Roman emperor
      deserve the name of liar.” On the third day, the ambassadors were
      dismissed; the freedom of several captives was granted, for a
      moderate ransom, to their pressing entreaties; and, besides the
      royal presents, they were permitted to accept from each of the
      Scythian nobles the honorable and useful gift of a horse. Maximin
      returned, by the same road, to Constantinople; and though he was
      involved in an accidental dispute with Beric, the new ambassador
      of Attila, he flattered himself that he had contributed, by the
      laborious journey, to confirm the peace and alliance of the two
      nations.

      4511 (return) [ Was this his own daughter, or the daughter of a
      person named Escam? (Gibbon has written incorrectly Eslam, an
      unknown name. The officer of Attila, called Eslas.) In either
      case the construction is imperfect: a good Greek writer would
      have introduced an article to determine the sense. Nor is it
      quite clear, whether Scythian usage is adduced to excuse the
      polygamy, or a marriage, which would be considered incestuous in
      other countries. The Latin version has carefully preserved the
      ambiguity, filiam Escam uxorem. I am not inclined to construe it
      ‘his own daughter’ though I have too little confidence in the
      uniformity of the grammatical idioms of the Byzantines (though
      Priscus is one of the best) to express myself without
      hesitation.—M.]

      4512 (return) [ This passage is remarkable from the connection of
      the name of Attila with that extraordinary cycle of poetry, which
      is found in different forms in almost all the Teutonic
      languages.]

      A Latin poem, de prima expeditione Attilæ, Regis Hunnorum, in
      Gallias, was published in the year 1780, by Fischer at Leipsic.
      It contains, with the continuation, 1452 lines. It abounds in
      metrical faults, but is occasionally not without some rude spirit
      and some copiousness of fancy in the variation of the
      circumstances in the different combats of the hero Walther,
      prince of Aquitania. It contains little which can be supposed
      historical, and still less which is characteristic concerning
      Attila. It relates to a first expedition of Attila into Europe
      which cannot be traced in history, during which the kings of the
      Franks, of the Burgundians, and of Aquitaine, submit themselves,
      and give hostages to Attila: the king of the Franks, a personage
      who seems the same with the Hagen of Teutonic romance; the king
      of Burgundy, his daughter Heldgund; the king of Aquitaine, his
      son Walther. The main subject of the poem is the escape of
      Walther and Heldgund from the camp of Attila, and the combat
      between Walther and Gunthar, king of the Franks. with his twelve
      peers, among whom is Hagen. Walther had been betrayed while he
      passed through Worms, the city of the Frankish king, by paying
      for his ferry over the Rhine with some strange fish, which he had
      caught during his flight, and which were unknown in the waters of
      the Rhine. Gunthar was desirous of plundering him of the
      treasure, which Walther had carried off from the camp of Attila.
      The author of this poem is unknown, nor can I, on the vague and
      rather doubtful allusion to Thule, as Iceland, venture to assign
      its date. It was, evidently, recited in a monastery, as appears
      by the first line; and no doubt composed there. The faults of
      metre would point out a late date; and it may have been formed
      upon some local tradition, as Walther, the hero, seems to have
      turned monk.

      This poem, however, in its character and its incidents, bears no
      relation to the Teutonic cycle, of which the Nibelungen Lied is
      the most complete form. In this, in the Heldenbuch, in some of
      the Danish Sagas. in countess lays and ballads in all the
      dialects of Scandinavia, appears King Etzel (Attila) in strife
      with the Burgundians and the Franks. With these appears, by a
      poetic anachronism, Dietrich of Berne. (Theodoric of Verona,) the
      celebrated Ostrogothic king; and many other very singular
      coincidences of historic names, which appear in the poems. (See
      Lachman Kritik der Sage in his volume of various readings to the
      Nibelungen; Berlin, 1836, p. 336.)




      Chapter XXXIV: Attila.—Part III.

      I must acknowledge myself unable to form any satisfactory theory
      as to the connection of these poems with the history of the time,
      or the period, from which they may date their origin;
      notwithstanding the laborious investigations and critical
      sagacity of the Schlegels, the Grimms, of P. E. Muller and
      Lachman, and a whole host of German critics and antiquaries; not
      to omit our own countryman, Mr. Herbert, whose theory concerning
      Attila is certainly neither deficient in boldness nor
      originality. I conceive the only way to obtain any thing like a
      clear conception on this point would be what Lachman has begun,
      (see above,) patiently to collect and compare the various forms
      which the traditions have assumed, without any preconceived,
      either mythical or poetical, theory, and, if possible, to
      discover the original basis of the whole rich and fantastic
      legend. One point, which to me is strongly in favor of the
      antiquity of this poetic cycle, is, that the manners are so
      clearly anterior to chivalry, and to the influence exercised on
      the poetic literature of Europe by the chivalrous poems and
      romances. I think I find some traces of that influence in the
      Latin poem, though strained through the imagination of a monk.
      The English reader will find an amusing account of the German
      Nibelungen and Heldenbuch, and of some of the Scandinavian Sagas,
      in the volume of Northern Antiquities published by Weber, the
      friend of Sir Walter Scott. Scott himself contributed a
      considerable, no doubt far the most valuable, part to the work.

      46 (return) [ If we may believe Plutarch, (in Demetrio, tom. v.
      p. 24,) it was the custom of the Scythians, when they indulged in
      the pleasures of the table, to awaken their languid courage by
      the martial harmony of twanging their bow-strings.]

      4712 (return) [ The curious narrative of this embassy, which
      required few observations, and was not susceptible of any
      collateral evidence, may be found in Priscus, p. 49-70. But I
      have not confined myself to the same order; and I had previously
      extracted the historical circumstances, which were less
      intimately connected with the journey, and business, of the Roman
      ambassadors.]

      But the Roman ambassador was ignorant of the treacherous design,
      which had been concealed under the mask of the public faith. The
      surprise and satisfaction of Edecon, when he contemplated the
      splendor of Constantinople, had encouraged the interpreter
      Vigilius to procure for him a secret interview with the eunuch
      Chrysaphius, 48 who governed the emperor and the empire. After
      some previous conversation, and a mutual oath of secrecy, the
      eunuch, who had not, from his own feelings or experience, imbibed
      any exalted notions of ministerial virtue, ventured to propose
      the death of Attila, as an important service, by which Edecon
      might deserve a liberal share of the wealth and luxury which he
      admired. The ambassador of the Huns listened to the tempting
      offer; and professed, with apparent zeal, his ability, as well as
      readiness, to execute the bloody deed; the design was
      communicated to the master of the offices, and the devout
      Theodosius consented to the assassination of his invincible
      enemy. But this perfidious conspiracy was defeated by the
      dissimulation, or the repentance, of Edecon; and though he might
      exaggerate his inward abhorrence for the treason, which he seemed
      to approve, he dexterously assumed the merit of an early and
      voluntary confession. If we now review the embassy of Maximin,
      and the behavior of Attila, we must applaud the Barbarian, who
      respected the laws of hospitality, and generously entertained and
      dismissed the minister of a prince who had conspired against his
      life. But the rashness of Vigilius will appear still more
      extraordinary, since he returned, conscious of his guilt and
      danger, to the royal camp, accompanied by his son, and carrying
      with him a weighty purse of gold, which the favorite eunuch had
      furnished, to satisfy the demands of Edecon, and to corrupt the
      fidelity of the guards. The interpreter was instantly seized, and
      dragged before the tribunal of Attila, where he asserted his
      innocence with specious firmness, till the threat of inflicting
      instant death on his son extorted from him a sincere discovery of
      the criminal transaction. Under the name of ransom, or
      confiscation, the rapacious king of the Huns accepted two hundred
      pounds of gold for the life of a traitor, whom he disdained to
      punish. He pointed his just indignation against a nobler object.
      His ambassadors, Eslaw and Orestes, were immediately despatched
      to Constantinople, with a peremptory instruction, which it was
      much safer for them to execute than to disobey. They boldly
      entered the Imperial presence, with the fatal purse hanging down
      from the neck of Orestes; who interrogated the eunuch
      Chrysaphius, as he stood beside the throne, whether he recognized
      the evidence of his guilt. But the office of reproof was reserved
      for the superior dignity of his colleague Eslaw, who gravely
      addressed the emperor of the East in the following words:
      “Theodosius is the son of an illustrious and respectable parent:
      Attila likewise is descended from a noble race; and he has
      supported, by his actions, the dignity which he inherited from
      his father Mundzuk. But Theodosius has forfeited his paternal
      honors, and, by consenting to pay tribute has degraded himself to
      the condition of a slave. It is therefore just, that he should
      reverence the man whom fortune and merit have placed above him;
      instead of attempting, like a wicked slave, clandestinely to
      conspire against his master.” The son of Arcadius, who was
      accustomed only to the voice of flattery, heard with astonishment
      the severe language of truth: he blushed and trembled; nor did he
      presume directly to refuse the head of Chrysaphius, which Eslaw
      and Orestes were instructed to demand. A solemn embassy, armed
      with full powers and magnificent gifts, was hastily sent to
      deprecate the wrath of Attila; and his pride was gratified by the
      choice of Nomius and Anatolius, two ministers of consular or
      patrician rank, of whom the one was great treasurer, and the
      other was master-general of the armies of the East. He
      condescended to meet these ambassadors on the banks of the River
      Drenco; and though he at first affected a stern and haughty
      demeanor, his anger was insensibly mollified by their eloquence
      and liberality. He condescended to pardon the emperor, the
      eunuch, and the interpreter; bound himself by an oath to observe
      the conditions of peace; released a great number of captives;
      abandoned the fugitives and deserters to their fate; and resigned
      a large territory, to the south of the Danube, which he had
      already exhausted of its wealth and inhabitants. But this treaty
      was purchased at an expense which might have supported a vigorous
      and successful war; and the subjects of Theodosius were compelled
      to redeem the safety of a worthless favorite by oppressive taxes,
      which they would more cheerfully have paid for his destruction.

      48 (return) [ M. de Tillemont has very properly given the
      succession of chamberlains, who reigned in the name of
      Theodosius. Chrysaphius was the last, and, according to the
      unanimous evidence of history, the worst of these favorites, (see
      Hist. des Empereurs, tom. vi. p. 117-119. Mem. Eccles. tom. xv.
      p. 438.) His partiality for his godfather the heresiarch
      Eutyches, engaged him to persecute the orthodox party]

      49 (return) [ This secret conspiracy and its important
      consequences, may be traced in the fragments of Priscus, p. 37,
      38, 39, 54, 70, 71, 72. The chronology of that historian is not
      fixed by any precise date; but the series of negotiations between
      Attila and the Eastern empire must be included within the three
      or four years which are terminated, A.D. 450. by the death of
      Theodosius.]

      The emperor Theodosius did not long survive the most humiliating
      circumstance of an inglorious life. As he was riding, or hunting,
      in the neighborhood of Constantinople, he was thrown from his
      horse into the River Lycus: the spine of the back was injured by
      the fall; and he expired some days afterwards, in the fiftieth
      year of his age, and the forty-third of his reign. 50 His sister
      Pulcheria, whose authority had been controlled both in civil and
      ecclesiastical affairs by the pernicious influence of the
      eunuchs, was unanimously proclaimed Empress of the East; and the
      Romans, for the first time, submitted to a female reign. No
      sooner had Pulcheria ascended the throne, than she indulged her
      own and the public resentment, by an act of popular justice.
      Without any legal trial, the eunuch Chrysaphius was executed
      before the gates of the city; and the immense riches which had
      been accumulated by the rapacious favorite, served only to hasten
      and to justify his punishment. 51 Amidst the general acclamations
      of the clergy and people, the empress did not forget the
      prejudice and disadvantage to which her sex was exposed; and she
      wisely resolved to prevent their murmurs by the choice of a
      colleague, who would always respect the superior rank and virgin
      chastity of his wife. She gave her hand to Marcian, a senator,
      about sixty years of age; and the nominal husband of Pulcheria
      was solemnly invested with the Imperial purple. The zeal which he
      displayed for the orthodox creed, as it was established by the
      council of Chalcedon, would alone have inspired the grateful
      eloquence of the Catholics. But the behavior of Marcian in a
      private life, and afterwards on the throne, may support a more
      rational belief, that he was qualified to restore and invigorate
      an empire, which had been almost dissolved by the successive
      weakness of two hereditary monarchs. He was born in Thrace, and
      educated to the profession of arms; but Marcian’s youth had been
      severely exercised by poverty and misfortune, since his only
      resource, when he first arrived at Constantinople, consisted in
      two hundred pieces of gold, which he had borrowed of a friend. He
      passed nineteen years in the domestic and military service of
      Aspar, and his son Ardaburius; followed those powerful generals
      to the Persian and African wars; and obtained, by their
      influence, the honorable rank of tribune and senator. His mild
      disposition, and useful talents, without alarming the jealousy,
      recommended Marcian to the esteem and favor of his patrons; he
      had seen, perhaps he had felt, the abuses of a venal and
      oppressive administration; and his own example gave weight and
      energy to the laws, which he promulgated for the reformation of
      manners. 52

      give credit to Nicephorus Callistus, a Greek of the fourteenth
      century.]
