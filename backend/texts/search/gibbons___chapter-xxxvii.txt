Chapter XXXVII: Conversion Of The Barbarians To
      Christianity.—Part I.

     Origin Progress, And Effects Of The Monastic Life.— Conversion Of
     The Barbarians To Christianity And Arianism.— Persecution Of The
     Vandals In Africa.—Extinction Of Arianism Among The Barbarians.

      The indissoluble connection of civil and ecclesiastical affairs
      has compelled, and encouraged, me to relate the progress, the
      persecutions, the establishment, the divisions, the final
      triumph, and the gradual corruption, of Christianity. I have
      purposely delayed the consideration of two religious events,
      interesting in the study of human nature, and important in the
      decline and fall of the Roman empire. I. The institution of the
      monastic life; 1 and, II. The conversion of the northern
      Barbarians.

      1 (return) [ The origin of the monastic institution has been
      laboriously discussed by Thomassin (Discipline de l’Eglise, tom.
      i. p. 1119-1426) and Helyot, (Hist. des Ordres Monastiques, tom.
      i. p. 1-66.) These authors are very learned, and tolerably
      honest, and their difference of opinion shows the subject in its
      full extent. Yet the cautious Protestant, who distrusts any
      popish guides, may consult the seventh book of Bingham’s
      Christian Antiquities.]

      I. Prosperity and peace introduced the distinction of the vulgar
      and the Ascetic Christians. 2 The loose and imperfect practice of
      religion satisfied the conscience of the multitude. The prince or
      magistrate, the soldier or merchant, reconciled their fervent
      zeal, and implicit faith, with the exercise of their profession,
      the pursuit of their interest, and the indulgence of their
      passions: but the Ascetics, who obeyed and abused the rigid
      precepts of the gospel, were inspired by the savage enthusiasm
      which represents man as a criminal, and God as a tyrant. They
      seriously renounced the business, and the pleasures, of the age;
      abjured the use of wine, of flesh, and of marriage; chastised
      their body, mortified their affections, and embraced a life of
      misery, as the price of eternal happiness. In the reign of
      Constantine, the Ascetics fled from a profane and degenerate
      world, to perpetual solitude, or religious society. Like the
      first Christians of Jerusalem, 3 311 they resigned the use, or
      the property of their temporal possessions; established regular
      communities of the same sex, and a similar disposition; and
      assumed the names of Hermits, Monks, and Anachorets, expressive
      of their lonely retreat in a natural or artificial desert. They
      soon acquired the respect of the world, which they despised; and
      the loudest applause was bestowed on this Divine Philosophy, 4
      which surpassed, without the aid of science or reason, the
      laborious virtues of the Grecian schools. The monks might indeed
      contend with the Stoics, in the contempt of fortune, of pain, and
      of death: the Pythagorean silence and submission were revived in
      their servile discipline; and they disdained, as firmly as the
      Cynics themselves, all the forms and decencies of civil society.
      But the votaries of this Divine Philosophy aspired to imitate a
      purer and more perfect model. They trod in the footsteps of the
      prophets, who had retired to the desert; 5 and they restored the
      devout and contemplative life, which had been instituted by the
      Essenians, in Palestine and Egypt. The philosophic eye of Pliny
      had surveyed with astonishment a solitary people, who dwelt among
      the palm-trees near the Dead Sea; who subsisted without money,
      who were propagated without women; and who derived from the
      disgust and repentance of mankind a perpetual supply of voluntary
      associates. 6

      2 (return) [ See Euseb. Demonstrat. Evangel., (l. i. p. 20, 21,
      edit. Graec. Rob. Stephani, Paris, 1545.) In his Ecclesiastical
      History, published twelve years after the Demonstration, Eusebius
      (l. ii. c. 17) asserts the Christianity of the Therapeutae; but
      he appears ignorant that a similar institution was actually
      revived in Egypt.]

      3 (return) [ Cassian (Collat. xviii. 5.) claims this origin for
      the institution of the Coenobites, which gradually decayed till
      it was restored by Antony and his disciples.]

      311 (return) [ It has before been shown that the first Christian
      community was not strictly coenobitic. See vol. ii.—M.]

      4 (return) [ These are the expressive words of Sozomen, who
      copiously and agreeably describes (l. i. c. 12, 13, 14) the
      origin and progress of this monkish philosophy, (see Suicer.
      Thesau, Eccles., tom. ii. p. 1441.) Some modern writers, Lipsius
      (tom. iv. p. 448. Manuduct. ad Philosoph. Stoic. iii. 13) and La
      Mothe le Vayer, (tom. ix. de la Vertu des Payens, p. 228-262,)
      have compared the Carmelites to the Pythagoreans, and the Cynics
      to the Capucins.]

      5 (return) [ The Carmelites derive their pedigree, in regular
      succession, from the prophet Elijah, (see the Theses of Beziers,
      A.D. 1682, in Bayle’s Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres,
      Oeuvres, tom. i. p. 82, &c., and the prolix irony of the Ordres
      Monastiques, an anonymous work, tom. i. p. 1-433, Berlin, 1751.)
      Rome, and the inquisition of Spain, silenced the profane
      criticism of the Jesuits of Flanders, (Helyot, Hist. des Ordres
      Monastiques, tom. i. p. 282-300,) and the statue of Elijah, the
      Carmelite, has been erected in the church of St. Peter, (Voyages
      du P. Labat tom. iii. p. 87.)]

      beyond the noxious influence of the lake, and names Engaddi and

      Egypt, the fruitful parent of superstition, afforded the first
      example of the monastic life. Antony, 7 an illiterate 8 youth of
      the lower parts of Thebais, distributed his patrimony, 9 deserted
      his family and native home, and executed his monastic penance
      with original and intrepid fanaticism. After a long and painful
      novitiate, among the tombs, and in a ruined tower, he boldly
      advanced into the desert three days’ journey to the eastward of
      the Nile; discovered a lonely spot, which possessed the
      advantages of shade and water, and fixed his last residence on
      Mount Colzim, near the Red Sea; where an ancient monastery still
      preserves the name and memory of the saint. 10 The curious
      devotion of the Christians pursued him to the desert; and when he
      was obliged to appear at Alexandria, in the face of mankind, he
      supported his fame with discretion and dignity. He enjoyed the
      friendship of Athanasius, whose doctrine he approved; and the
      Egyptian peasant respectfully declined a respectful invitation
      from the emperor Constantine. The venerable patriarch (for Antony
      attained the age of one hundred and five years) beheld the
      numerous progeny which had been formed by his example and his
      lessons. The prolific colonies of monks multiplied with rapid
      increase on the sands of Libya, upon the rocks of Thebais, and in
      the cities of the Nile. To the south of Alexandria, the mountain,
      and adjacent desert, of Nitria, were peopled by five thousand
      anachorets; and the traveller may still investigate the ruins of
      fifty monasteries, which were planted in that barren soil by the
      disciples of Antony. 11 In the Upper Thebais, the vacant island
      of Tabenne, 12 was occupied by Pachomius and fourteen hundred of
      his brethren. That holy abbot successively founded nine
      monasteries of men, and one of women; and the festival of Easter
      sometimes collected fifty thousand religious persons, who
      followed his angelic rule of discipline. 13 The stately and
      populous city of Oxyrinchus, the seat of Christian orthodoxy, had
      devoted the temples, the public edifices, and even the ramparts,
      to pious and charitable uses; and the bishop, who might preach in
      twelve churches, computed ten thousand females and twenty
      thousand males, of the monastic profession. 14 The Egyptians, who
      gloried in this marvellous revolution, were disposed to hope, and
      to believe, that the number of the monks was equal to the
      remainder of the people; 15 and posterity might repeat the
      saying, which had formerly been applied to the sacred animals of
      the same country, That in Egypt it was less difficult to find a
      god than a man.

      Patrum, p. 26-74, with Rosweyde’s Annotations. The former is the
      Greek original the latter, a very ancient Latin version by
      Evagrius, the friend of St. Jerom.]

      8 (return) [ Athanas. tom. ii. in Vit. St. Anton. p. 452; and the
      assertion of his total ignorance has been received by many of the
      ancients and moderns. But Tillemont (Mem. Eccles. tom. vii. p.
      666) shows, by some probable arguments, that Antony could read
      and write in the Coptic, his native tongue; and that he was only
      a stranger to the Greek letters. The philosopher Synesius (p. 51)
      acknowledges that the natural genius of Antony did not require
      the aid of learning.]

      9 (return) [ Aruroe autem erant ei trecentae uberes, et valde

      measure, of a hundred Egyptian cubits, (Rosweyde, Onomasticon ad
      Vit. Patrum, p. 1014, 1015,) and the Egyptian cubit of all ages
      be equal to twenty-two English inches, (Greaves, vol. i. p. 233,)
      the arura will consist of about three quarters of an English
      acre.]

      which now contains four monasteries, and twenty or thirty monks.

      12 (return) [ Tabenne is a small island in the Nile, in the
      diocese of Tentyra or Dendera, between the modern town of Girge
      and the ruins of ancient Thebes, (D’Anville, p. 194.) M. de
      Tillemont doubts whether it was an isle; but I may conclude, from
      his own facts, that the primitive name was afterwards transferred
      to the great monastery of Bau or Pabau, (Mem. Eccles. tom. vii.
      p. 678, 688.)]

      Strabo (l. xvii. p. 1166) and Ammianus (xxii. 16) have made
      honorable mention of Oxyrinchus, whose inhabitants adored a small
      fish in a magnificent temple.]

      15 (return) [ Quanti populi habentur in urbibus, tantae paene
      habentur in desertis multitudines monachorum. Rufin. c. 7, in
      Vit. Patrum, p. 461. He congratulates the fortunate change.]

      Athanasius introduced into Rome the knowledge and practice of the
      monastic life; and a school of this new philosophy was opened by
      the disciples of Antony, who accompanied their primate to the
      holy threshold of the Vatican. The strange and savage appearance
      of these Egyptians excited, at first, horror and contempt, and,
      at length, applause and zealous imitation. The senators, and more
      especially the matrons, transformed their palaces and villas into
      religious houses; and the narrow institution of six vestals was
      eclipsed by the frequent monasteries, which were seated on the
      ruins of ancient temples, and in the midst of the Roman forum. 16
      Inflamed by the example of Antony, a Syrian youth, whose name was
      Hilarion, 17 fixed his dreary abode on a sandy beach, between the
      sea and a morass, about seven miles from Gaza. The austere
      penance, in which he persisted forty-eight years, diffused a
      similar enthusiasm; and the holy man was followed by a train of
      two or three thousand anachorets, whenever he visited the
      innumerable monasteries of Palestine. The fame of Basil 18 is
      immortal in the monastic history of the East. With a mind that
      had tasted the learning and eloquence of Athens; with an ambition
      scarcely to be satisfied with the archbishopric of Caesarea,
      Basil retired to a savage solitude in Pontus; and deigned, for a
      while, to give laws to the spiritual colonies which he profusely
      scattered along the coast of the Black Sea. In the West, Martin
      of Tours, 19 a soldier, a hermit, a bishop, and a saint,
      established the monasteries of Gaul; two thousand of his
      disciples followed him to the grave; and his eloquent historian
      challenges the deserts of Thebais to produce, in a more favorable
      climate, a champion of equal virtue. The progress of the monks
      was not less rapid, or universal, than that of Christianity
      itself. Every province, and, at last, every city, of the empire,
      was filled with their increasing multitudes; and the bleak and
      barren isles, from Lerins to Lipari, that arose out of the Tuscan
      Sea, were chosen by the anachorets for the place of their
      voluntary exile. An easy and perpetual intercourse by sea and
      land connected the provinces of the Roman world; and the life of
      Hilarion displays the facility with which an indigent hermit of
      Palestine might traverse Egypt, embark for Sicily, escape to
      Epirus, and finally settle in the Island of Cyprus. 20 The Latin
      Christians embraced the religious institutions of Rome. The
      pilgrims, who visited Jerusalem, eagerly copied, in the most
      distant climates of the earth, the faithful model of the monastic
      life. The disciples of Antony spread themselves beyond the
      tropic, over the Christian empire of Æthiopia. 21 The monastery
      of Banchor, 22 in Flintshire, which contained above two thousand
      brethren, dispersed a numerous colony among the Barbarians of
      Ireland; 23 and Iona, one of the Hebrides, which was planted by
      the Irish monks, diffused over the northern regions a doubtful
      ray of science and superstition. 24

      16 (return) [ The introduction of the monastic life into Rome and
      Italy is occasionally mentioned by Jerom, tom. i. p. 119, 120,
      199.]

      17 (return) [ See the Life of Hilarion, by St. Jerom, (tom. i. p.
      241, 252.) The stories of Paul, Hilarion, and Malchus, by the
      same author, are admirably told: and the only defect of these
      pleasing compositions is the want of truth and common sense.]

      18 (return) [ His original retreat was in a small village on the
      banks of the Iris, not far from Neo-Caesarea. The ten or twelve
      years of his monastic life were disturbed by long and frequent
      avocations. Some critics have disputed the authenticity of his
      Ascetic rules; but the external evidence is weighty, and they can
      only prove that it is the work of a real or affected enthusiast.

      Severus, who asserts (Dialog. i. 16) that the booksellers of Rome
      were delighted with the quick and ready sale of his popular
      work.]

      20 (return) [ When Hilarion sailed from Paraetonium to Cape
      Pachynus, he offered to pay his passage with a book of the
      Gospels. Posthumian, a Gallic monk, who had visited Egypt, found
      a merchant ship bound from Alexandria to Marseilles, and
      performed the voyage in thirty days, (Sulp. Sever. Dialog. i. 1.)
      Athanasius, who addressed his Life of St. Antony to the foreign
      monks, was obliged to hasten the composition, that it might be
      ready for the sailing of the fleets, (tom. ii. p. 451.)]

      21 (return) [ See Jerom, (tom. i. p. 126,) Assemanni, Bibliot.

      Æthiopia, p. 29-31. The Abyssinian monks adhere very strictly to
      the primitive institution.]

      the dark ages is copiously stated by Archbishop Usher in his
      Britannicarum Ecclesiarum Antiquitates, cap. xvi. p. 425-503.]

      24 (return) [ This small, though not barren, spot, Iona, Hy, or
      Columbkill, only two miles in length, aud one mile in breadth,
      has been distinguished, 1. By the monastery of St. Columba,
      founded A.D. 566; whose abbot exercised an extraordinary
      jurisdiction over the bishops of Caledonia; 2. By a classic
      library, which afforded some hopes of an entire Livy; and, 3. By
      the tombs of sixty kings, Scots, Irish, and Norwegians, who
      reposed in holy ground. See Usher (p. 311, 360-370) and Buchanan,
      (Rer. Scot. l. ii. p. 15, edit. Ruddiman.)]

      These unhappy exiles from social life were impelled by the dark
      and implacable genius of superstition. Their mutual resolution
      was supported by the example of millions, of either sex, of every
      age, and of every rank; and each proselyte who entered the gates
      of a monastery, was persuaded that he trod the steep and thorny
      path of eternal happiness. 25 But the operation of these
      religious motives was variously determined by the temper and
      situation of mankind. Reason might subdue, or passion might
      suspend, their influence: but they acted most forcibly on the
      infirm minds of children and females; they were strengthened by
      secret remorse, or accidental misfortune; and they might derive
      some aid from the temporal considerations of vanity or interest.
      It was naturally supposed, that the pious and humble monks, who
      had renounced the world to accomplish the work of their
      salvation, were the best qualified for the spiritual government
      of the Christians. The reluctant hermit was torn from his cell,
      and seated, amidst the acclamations of the people, on the
      episcopal throne: the monasteries of Egypt, of Gaul, and of the
      East, supplied a regular succession of saints and bishops; and
      ambition soon discovered the secret road which led to the
      possession of wealth and honors. 26 The popular monks, whose
      reputation was connected with the fame and success of the order,
      assiduously labored to multiply the number of their
      fellow-captives. They insinuated themselves into noble and
      opulent families; and the specious arts of flattery and seduction
      were employed to secure those proselytes who might bestow wealth
      or dignity on the monastic profession. The indignant father
      bewailed the loss, perhaps, of an only son; 27 the credulous maid
      was betrayed by vanity to violate the laws of nature; and the
      matron aspired to imaginary perfection, by renouncing the virtues
      of domestic life. Paula yielded to the persuasive eloquence of
      Jerom; 28 and the profane title of mother-in-law of God 29
      tempted that illustrious widow to consecrate the virginity of her
      daughter Eustochium. By the advice, and in the company, of her
      spiritual guide, Paula abandoned Rome and her infant son; retired
      to the holy village of Bethlem; founded a hospital and four
      monasteries; and acquired, by her alms and penance, an eminent
      and conspicuous station in the Catholic church. Such rare and
      illustrious penitents were celebrated as the glory and example of
      their age; but the monasteries were filled by a crowd of obscure
      and abject plebeians, 30 who gained in the cloister much more
      than they had sacrificed in the world. Peasants, slaves, and
      mechanics, might escape from poverty and contempt to a safe and
      honorable profession; whose apparent hardships are mitigated by
      custom, by popular applause, and by the secret relaxation of
      discipline. 31 The subjects of Rome, whose persons and fortunes
      were made responsible for unequal and exorbitant tributes,
      retired from the oppression of the Imperial government; and the
      pusillanimous youth preferred the penance of a monastic, to the
      dangers of a military, life. The affrighted provincials of every
      rank, who fled before the Barbarians, found shelter and
      subsistence: whole legions were buried in these religious
      sanctuaries; and the same cause, which relieved the distress of
      individuals, impaired the strength and fortitude of the empire.

      25 (return) [ Chrysostom (in the first tome of the Benedictine
      edition) has consecrated three books to the praise and defence of
      the monastic life. He is encouraged, by the example of the ark,
      to presume that none but the elect (the monks) can possibly be
      saved (l. i. p. 55, 56.) Elsewhere, indeed, he becomes more
      merciful, (l. iii. p. 83, 84,) and allows different degrees of
      glory, like the sun, moon, and stars. In his lively comparison of
      a king and a monk, (l. iii. p. 116-121,) he supposes (what is
      hardly fair) that the king will be more sparingly rewarded, and
      more rigorously punished.]

      portion of his works: the particular treatise, which he styles
      the Epitaph of Paula, (tom. i. p. 169-192,) is an elaborate and
      extravagant panegyric. The exordium is ridiculously turgid: “If
      all the members of my body were changed into tongues, and if all
      my limbs resounded with a human voice, yet should I be
      incapable,” &c.]

      du peuple.”]

      32 (return) [ See a very sensible preface of Lucas Holstenius to
      the Codex Regularum. The emperors attempted to support the
      obligation of public and private duties; but the feeble dikes
      were swept away by the torrent of superstition; and Justinian
      surpassed the most sanguine wishes of the monks, (Thomassin, tom.
      i. p. 1782-1799, and Bingham, l. vii. c. iii. p. 253.) Note: The

      congregantur. Cad. Theod l. xii. tit. i. leg. 63.—G.]

      The monastic profession of the ancients 33 was an act of
      voluntary devotion. The inconstant fanatic was threatened with
      the eternal vengeance of the God whom he deserted; but the doors
      of the monastery were still open for repentance. Those monks,
      whose conscience was fortified by reason or passion, were at
      liberty to resume the character of men and citizens; and even the
      spouses of Christ might accept the legal embraces of an earthly
      lover. 34 The examples of scandal, and the progress of
      superstition, suggested the propriety of more forcible
      restraints. After a sufficient trial, the fidelity of the novice
      was secured by a solemn and perpetual vow; and his irrevocable
      engagement was ratified by the laws of the church and state. A
      guilty fugitive was pursued, arrested, and restored to his
      perpetual prison; and the interposition of the magistrate
      oppressed the freedom and the merit, which had alleviated, in
      some degree, the abject slavery of the monastic discipline. 35
      The actions of a monk, his words, and even his thoughts, were
      determined by an inflexible rule, 36 or a capricious superior:
      the slightest offences were corrected by disgrace or confinement,
      extraordinary fasts, or bloody flagellation; and disobedience,
      murmur, or delay, were ranked in the catalogue of the most
      heinous sins. 37 A blind submission to the commands of the abbot,
      however absurd, or even criminal, they might seem, was the ruling
      principle, the first virtue of the Egyptian monks; and their
      patience was frequently exercised by the most extravagant trials.
      They were directed to remove an enormous rock; assiduously to
      water a barren staff, that was planted in the ground, till, at
      the end of three years, it should vegetate and blossom like a
      tree; to walk into a fiery furnace; or to cast their infant into
      a deep pond: and several saints, or madmen, have been
      immortalized in monastic story, by their thoughtless and fearless
      obedience. 38 The freedom of the mind, the source of every
      generous and rational sentiment, was destroyed by the habits of
      credulity and submission; and the monk, contracting the vices of
      a slave, devoutly followed the faith and passions of his
      ecclesiastical tyrant. The peace of the Eastern church was
      invaded by a swarm of fanatics, incapable of fear, or reason, or
      humanity; and the Imperial troops acknowledged, without shame,
      that they were much less apprehensive of an encounter with the
      fiercest Barbarians. 39

      Superstition has often framed and consecrated the fantastic
      garments of the monks: 40 but their apparent singularity
      sometimes proceeds from their uniform attachment to a simple and
      primitive model, which the revolutions of fashion have made
      ridiculous in the eyes of mankind. The father of the Benedictines
      expressly disclaims all idea of choice of merit; and soberly
      exhorts his disciples to adopt the coarse and convenient dress of
      the countries which they may inhabit. 41 The monastic habits of
      the ancients varied with the climate, and their mode of life; and
      they assumed, with the same indifference, the sheep-skin of the
      Egyptian peasants, or the cloak of the Grecian philosophers. They
      allowed themselves the use of linen in Egypt, where it was a
      cheap and domestic manufacture; but in the West they rejected
      such an expensive article of foreign luxury. 42 It was the
      practice of the monks either to cut or shave their hair; they
      wrapped their heads in a cowl to escape the sight of profane
      objects; their legs and feet were naked, except in the extreme
      cold of winter; and their slow and feeble steps were supported by
      a long staff. The aspect of a genuine anachoret was horrid and
      disgusting: every sensation that is offensive to man was thought
      acceptable to God; and the angelic rule of Tabenne condemned the
      salutary custom of bathing the limbs in water, and of anointing
      them with oil. 43 431 The austere monks slept on the ground, on a
      hard mat, or a rough blanket; and the same bundle of palm-leaves
      served them as a seat in the day, and a pillow in the night.
      Their original cells were low, narrow huts, built of the
      slightest materials; which formed, by the regular distribution of
      the streets, a large and populous village, enclosing, within the
      common wall, a church, a hospital, perhaps a library, some
      necessary offices, a garden, and a fountain or reservoir of fresh
      water. Thirty or forty brethren composed a family of separate
      discipline and diet; and the great monasteries of Egypt consisted
      of thirty or forty families.

      Chapter XXXVII: Conversion Of The Barbarians To
      Christianity.—Part II.

      Pleasure and guilt are synonymous terms in the language of the
      monks, and they discovered, by experience, that rigid fasts, and
      abstemious diet, are the most effectual preservatives against the
      impure desires of the flesh. 44 The rules of abstinence which
      they imposed, or practised, were not uniform or perpetual: the
      cheerful festival of the Pentecost was balanced by the
      extraordinary mortification of Lent; the fervor of new
      monasteries was insensibly relaxed; and the voracious appetite of
      the Gauls could not imitate the patient and temperate virtue of
      the Egyptians. 45 The disciples of Antony and Pachomius were
      satisfied with their daily pittance, 46 of twelve ounces of
      bread, or rather biscuit, 47 which they divided into two frugal
      repasts, of the afternoon and of the evening. It was esteemed a
      merit, and almost a duty, to abstain from the boiled vegetables
      which were provided for the refectory; but the extraordinary
      bounty of the abbot sometimes indulged them with the luxury of
      cheese, fruit, salad, and the small dried fish of the Nile. 48 A
      more ample latitude of sea and river fish was gradually allowed
      or assumed; but the use of flesh was long confined to the sick or
      travellers; and when it gradually prevailed in the less rigid
      monasteries of Europe, a singular distinction was introduced; as
      if birds, whether wild or domestic, had been less profane than
      the grosser animals of the field. Water was the pure and innocent
      beverage of the primitive monks; and the founder of the
      Benedictines regrets the daily portion of half a pint of wine,
      which had been extorted from him by the intemperance of the age.
      49 Such an allowance might be easily supplied by the vineyards of
      Italy; and his victorious disciples, who passed the Alps, the
      Rhine, and the Baltic, required, in the place of wine, an
      adequate compensation of strong beer or cider.

      44 (return) [ St. Jerom, in strong, but indiscreet, language,
      expresses the most important use of fasting and abstinence: “Non
      quod Deus universitatis Creator et Dominus, intestinorum
      nostrorum rugitu, et inanitate ventris, pulmonisque ardore
      delectetur, sed quod aliter pudicitia tuta esse non possit.” (Op.

      aerum temperies, and the qualitas nostrae fragilitatis,
      (Institut. iv. 11.) Among the Western rules, that of Columbanus
      is the most austere; he had been educated amidst the poverty of
      Ireland, as rigid, perhaps, and inflexible as the abstemious
      virtue of Egypt. The rule of Isidore of Seville is the mildest;
      on holidays he allows the use of flesh.]

      but he made them work in proportion as they ate, (Pallad. in

      The candidate who aspired to the virtue of evangelical poverty,
      abjured, at his first entrance into a regular community, the
      idea, and even the name, of all separate or exclusive
      possessions. 50 The brethren were supported by their manual
      labor; and the duty of labor was strenuously recommended as a
      penance, as an exercise, and as the most laudable means of
      securing their daily subsistence. 51 The garden and fields, which
      the industry of the monks had often rescued from the forest or
      the morass, were diligently cultivated by their hands. They
      performed, without reluctance, the menial offices of slaves and
      domestics; and the several trades that were necessary to provide
      their habits, their utensils, and their lodging, were exercised
      within the precincts of the great monasteries. The monastic
      studies have tended, for the most part, to darken, rather than to
      dispel, the cloud of superstition. Yet the curiosity or zeal of
      some learned solitaries has cultivated the ecclesiastical, and
      even the profane, sciences; and posterity must gratefully
      acknowledge, that the monuments of Greek and Roman literature
      have been preserved and multiplied by their indefatigable pens.
      52 But the more humble industry of the monks, especially in
      Egypt, was contented with the silent, sedentary occupation of
      making wooden sandals, or of twisting the leaves of the palm-tree
      into mats and baskets. The superfluous stock, which was not
      consumed in domestic use, supplied, by trade, the wants of the
      community: the boats of Tabenne, and the other monasteries of
      Thebais, descended the Nile as far as Alexandria; and, in a
      Christian market, the sanctity of the workmen might enhance the
      intrinsic value of the work.

      235, 288;) and the rule of Columbanus punished them with six
      lashes. The ironical author of the Ordres Monastiques, who laughs
      at the foolish nicety of modern convents, seems ignorant that the
      ancients were equally absurd.]

      51 (return) [ Two great masters of ecclesiastical science, the P.
      Thomassin, (Discipline de l’Eglise, tom. iii. p. 1090-1139,) and
      the P. Mabillon, (Etudes Monastiques, tom. i. p. 116-155,) have
      seriously examined the manual labor of the monks, which the
      former considers as a merit and the latter as a duty.]

      52 (return) [ Mabillon (Etudes Monastiques, tom. i. p. 47-55) has
      collected many curious facts to justify the literary labors of
      his predecessors, both in the East and West. Books were copied in
      the ancient monasteries of Egypt, (Cassian. Institut. l. iv. c.
      12,) and by the disciples of St. Martin, (Sulp. Sever. in Vit.
      Martin. c. 7, p. 473.) Cassiodorus has allowed an ample scope for
      the studies of the monks; and we shall not be scandalized, if
      their pens sometimes wandered from Chrysostom and Augustin to
      Homer and Virgil. But the necessity of manual labor was
      insensibly superseded.]

      The novice was tempted to bestow his fortune on the saints, in
      whose society he was resolved to spend the remainder of his life;
      and the pernicious indulgence of the laws permitted him to
      receive, for their use, any future accessions of legacy or
      inheritance. 53 Melania contributed her plate, three hundred
      pounds weight of silver; and Paula contracted an immense debt,
      for the relief of their favorite monks; who kindly imparted the
      merits of their prayers and penance to a rich and liberal sinner.
      54 Time continually increased, and accidents could seldom
      diminish, the estates of the popular monasteries, which spread
      over the adjacent country and cities: and, in the first century
      of their institution, the infidel Zosimus has maliciously
      observed, that, for the benefit of the poor, the Christian monks
      had reduced a great part of mankind to a state of beggary. 55 As
      long as they maintained their original fervor, they approved
      themselves, however, the faithful and benevolent stewards of the
      charity, which was entrusted to their care. But their discipline
      was corrupted by prosperity: they gradually assumed the pride of
      wealth, and at last indulged the luxury of expense. Their public
      luxury might be excused by the magnificence of religious worship,
      and the decent motive of erecting durable habitations for an
      immortal society. But every age of the church has accused the
      licentiousness of the degenerate monks; who no longer remembered
      the object of their institution, embraced the vain and sensual
      pleasures of the world, which they had renounced, 56 and
      scandalously abused the riches which had been acquired by the
      austere virtues of their founders. 57 Their natural descent, from
      such painful and dangerous virtue, to the common vices of
      humanity, will not, perhaps, excite much grief or indignation in
      the mind of a philosopher.

      promiscuous monasteries of both sexes; but it appears from

      rank of a sovereign prince.”—I forget the consequences of his vow
      of chastity.]

      The lives of the primitive monks were consumed in penance and
      solitude; undisturbed by the various occupations which fill the
      time, and exercise the faculties, of reasonable, active, and
      social beings. Whenever they were permitted to step beyond the
      precincts of the monastery, two jealous companions were the
      mutual guards and spies of each other’s actions; and, after their
      return, they were condemned to forget, or, at least, to suppress,
      whatever they had seen or heard in the world. Strangers, who
      professed the orthodox faith, were hospitably entertained in a
      separate apartment; but their dangerous conversation was
      restricted to some chosen elders of approved discretion and
      fidelity. Except in their presence, the monastic slave might not
      receive the visits of his friends or kindred; and it was deemed
      highly meritorious, if he afflicted a tender sister, or an aged
      parent, by the obstinate refusal of a word or look. 58 The monks
      themselves passed their lives, without personal attachments,
      among a crowd which had been formed by accident, and was
      detained, in the same prison, by force or prejudice. Recluse
      fanatics have few ideas or sentiments to communicate: a special
      license of the abbot regulated the time and duration of their
      familiar visits; and, at their silent meals, they were enveloped
      in their cowls, inaccessible, and almost invisible, to each
      other. 59 Study is the resource of solitude: but education had
      not prepared and qualified for any liberal studies the mechanics
      and peasants who filled the monastic communities. They might
      work: but the vanity of spiritual perfection was tempted to
      disdain the exercise of manual labor; and the industry must be
      faint and languid, which is not excited by the sense of personal
      interest.

      intolerable laws of silence and mortification.]

      According to their faith and zeal, they might employ the day,
      which they passed in their cells, either in vocal or mental
      prayer: they assembled in the evening, and they were awakened in
      the night, for the public worship of the monastery. The precise
      moment was determined by the stars, which are seldom clouded in
      the serene sky of Egypt; and a rustic horn, or trumpet, the
      signal of devotion, twice interrupted the vast silence of the
      desert. 60 Even sleep, the last refuge of the unhappy, was
      rigorously measured: the vacant hours of the monk heavily rolled
      along, without business or pleasure; and, before the close of
      each day, he had repeatedly accused the tedious progress of the
      sun. 61 In this comfortless state, superstition still pursued and
      tormented her wretched votaries. 62 The repose which they had
      sought in the cloister was disturbed by a tardy repentance,
      profane doubts, and guilty desires; and, while they considered
      each natural impulse as an unpardonable sin, they perpetually
      trembled on the edge of a flaming and bottomless abyss. From the
      painful struggles of disease and despair, these unhappy victims
      were sometimes relieved by madness or death; and, in the sixth
      century, a hospital was founded at Jerusalem for a small portion
      of the austere penitents, who were deprived of their senses. 63
      Their visions, before they attained this extreme and acknowledged
      term of frenzy, have afforded ample materials of supernatural
      history. It was their firm persuasion, that the air, which they
      breathed, was peopled with invisible enemies; with innumerable
      demons, who watched every occasion, and assumed every form, to
      terrify, and above all to tempt, their unguarded virtue. The
      imagination, and even the senses, were deceived by the illusions
      of distempered fanaticism; and the hermit, whose midnight prayer
      was oppressed by involuntary slumber, might easily confound the
      phantoms of horror or delight, which had occupied his sleeping
      and his waking dreams. 64

      The monks were divided into two classes: the Coenobites, who
      lived under a common and regular discipline; and the Anachorets,
      who indulged their unsocial, independent fanaticism. 65 The most
      devout, or the most ambitious, of the spiritual brethren,
      renounced the convent, as they had renounced the world. The
      fervent monasteries of Egypt, Palestine, and Syria, were
      surrounded by a Laura, 66 a distant circle of solitary cells; and
      the extravagant penance of Hermits was stimulated by applause and
      emulation. 67 They sunk under the painful weight of crosses and
      chains; and their emaciated limbs were confined by collars,
      bracelets, gauntlets, and greaves of massy and rigid iron. All
      superfluous encumbrance of dress they contemptuously cast away;
      and some savage saints of both sexes have been admired, whose
      naked bodies were only covered by their long hair. They aspired
      to reduce themselves to the rude and miserable state in which the
      human brute is scarcely distinguishable above his kindred
      animals; and the numerous sect of Anachorets derived their name
      from their humble practice of grazing in the fields of
      Mesopotamia with the common herd. 68 They often usurped the den
      of some wild beast whom they affected to resemble; they buried
      themselves in some gloomy cavern, which art or nature had scooped
      out of the rock; and the marble quarries of Thebais are still
      inscribed with the monuments of their penance. 69 The most
      perfect Hermits are supposed to have passed many days without
      food, many nights without sleep, and many years without speaking;
      and glorious was the man ( I abuse that name) who contrived any
      cell, or seat, of a peculiar construction, which might expose
      him, in the most inconvenient posture, to the inclemency of the
      seasons.

      Among these heroes of the monastic life, the name and genius of
      Simeon Stylites 70 have been immortalized by the singular
      invention of an aerial penance. At the age of thirteen, the young
      Syrian deserted the profession of a shepherd, and threw himself
      into an austere monastery. After a long and painful novitiate, in
      which Simeon was repeatedly saved from pious suicide, he
      established his residence on a mountain, about thirty or forty
      miles to the east of Antioch. Within the space of a mandra, or
      circle of stones, to which he had attached himself by a ponderous
      chain, he ascended a column, which was successively raised from
      the height of nine, to that of sixty, feet from the ground. 71 In
      this last and lofty station, the Syrian Anachoret resisted the
      heat of thirty summers, and the cold of as many winters. Habit
      and exercise instructed him to maintain his dangerous situation
      without fear or giddiness, and successively to assume the
      different postures of devotion. He sometimes prayed in an erect
      attitude, with his outstretched arms in the figure of a cross,
      but his most familiar practice was that of bending his meagre
      skeleton from the forehead to the feet; and a curious spectator,
      after numbering twelve hundred and forty-four repetitions, at
      length desisted from the endless account. The progress of an
      ulcer in his thigh 72 might shorten, but it could not disturb,
      this celestial life; and the patient Hermit expired, without
      descending from his column. A prince, who should capriciously
      inflict such tortures, would be deemed a tyrant; but it would
      surpass the power of a tyrant to impose a long and miserable
      existence on the reluctant victims of his cruelty. This voluntary
      martyrdom must have gradually destroyed the sensibility both of
      the mind and body; nor can it be presumed that the fanatics, who
      torment themselves, are susceptible of any lively affection for
      the rest of mankind. A cruel, unfeeling temper has distinguished
      the monks of every age and country: their stern indifference,
      which is seldom mollified by personal friendship, is inflamed by
      religious hatred; and their merciless zeal has strenuously
      administered the holy office of the Inquisition.

      deceived.]

      72 (return) [ I must not conceal a piece of ancient scandal
      concerning the origin of this ulcer. It has been reported that
      the Devil, assuming an angelic form, invited him to ascend, like
      Elijah, into a fiery chariot. The saint too hastily raised his
      foot, and Satan seized the moment of inflicting this chastisement
      on his vanity.]

      The monastic saints, who excite only the contempt and pity of a
      philosopher, were respected, and almost adored, by the prince and
      people. Successive crowds of pilgrims from Gaul and India saluted
      the divine pillar of Simeon: the tribes of Saracens disputed in
      arms the honor of his benediction; the queens of Arabia and
      Persia gratefully confessed his supernatural virtue; and the
      angelic Hermit was consulted by the younger Theodosius, in the
      most important concerns of the church and state. His remains were
      transported from the mountain of Telenissa, by a solemn
      procession of the patriarch, the master-general of the East, six
      bishops, twenty-one counts or tribunes, and six thousand
      soldiers; and Antioch revered his bones, as her glorious ornament
      and impregnable defence. The fame of the apostles and martyrs was
      gradually eclipsed by these recent and popular Anachorets; the
      Christian world fell prostrate before their shrines; and the
      miracles ascribed to their relics exceeded, at least in number
      and duration, the spiritual exploits of their lives. But the
      golden legend of their lives 73 was embellished by the artful
      credulity of their interested brethren; and a believing age was
      easily persuaded, that the slightest caprice of an Egyptian or a
      Syrian monk had been sufficient to interrupt the eternal laws of
      the universe. The favorites of Heaven were accustomed to cure
      inveterate diseases with a touch, a word, or a distant message;
      and to expel the most obstinate demons from the souls or bodies
      which they possessed. They familiarly accosted, or imperiously
      commanded, the lions and serpents of the desert; infused
      vegetation into a sapless trunk; suspended iron on the surface of
      the water; passed the Nile on the back of a crocodile, and
      refreshed themselves in a fiery furnace. These extravagant tales,
      which display the fiction without the genius, of poetry, have
      seriously affected the reason, the faith, and the morals, of the
      Christians. Their credulity debased and vitiated the faculties of
      the mind: they corrupted the evidence of history; and
      superstition gradually extinguished the hostile light of
      philosophy and science. Every mode of religious worship which had
      been practised by the saints, every mysterious doctrine which
      they believed, was fortified by the sanction of divine
      revelation, and all the manly virtues were oppressed by the
      servile and pusillanimous reign of the monks. If it be possible
      to measure the interval between the philosophic writings of
      Cicero and the sacred legend of Theodoret, between the character
      of Cato and that of Simeon, we may appreciate the memorable
      revolution which was accomplished in the Roman empire within a
      period of five hundred years.

      73 (return) [ I know not how to select or specify the miracles
      contained in the Vitae Patrum of Rosweyde, as the number very
      much exceeds the thousand pages of that voluminous work. An
      elegant specimen may be found in the dialogues of Sulpicius
      Severus, and his Life of St. Martin. He reveres the monks of
      Egypt; yet he insults them with the remark, that they never
      raised the dead; whereas the bishop of Tours had restored three
      dead men to life.]

      II. The progress of Christianity has been marked by two glorious
      and decisive victories: over the learned and luxurious citizens
      of the Roman empire; and over the warlike Barbarians of Scythia
      and Germany, who subverted the empire, and embraced the religion,
      of the Romans. The Goths were the foremost of these savage
      proselytes; and the nation was indebted for its conversion to a
      countryman, or, at least, to a subject, worthy to be ranked among
      the inventors of useful arts, who have deserved the remembrance
      and gratitude of posterity. A great number of Roman provincials
      had been led away into captivity by the Gothic bands, who ravaged
      Asia in the time of Gallienus; and of these captives, many were
      Christians, and several belonged to the ecclesiastical order.
      Those involuntary missionaries, dispersed as slaves in the
      villages of Dacia, successively labored for the salvation of
      their masters. The seeds which they planted, of the evangelic
      doctrine, were gradually propagated; and before the end of a
      century, the pious work was achieved by the labors of Ulphilas,
      whose ancestors had been transported beyond the Danube from a
      small town of Cappadocia.

      Ulphilas, the bishop and apostle of the Goths, 74 acquired their
      love and reverence by his blameless life and indefatigable zeal;
      and they received, with implicit confidence, the doctrines of
      truth and virtue which he preached and practised. He executed the
      arduous task of translating the Scriptures into their native
      tongue, a dialect of the German or Teutonic language; but he
      prudently suppressed the four books of Kings, as they might tend
      to irritate the fierce and sanguinary spirit of the Barbarians.
      The rude, imperfect idiom of soldiers and shepherds, so ill
      qualified to communicate any spiritual ideas, was improved and
      modulated by his genius: and Ulphilas, before he could frame his
      version, was obliged to compose a new alphabet of twenty-four
      letters; 741 four of which he invented, to express the peculiar
      sounds that were unknown to the Greek and Latin pronunciation. 75
      But the prosperous state of the Gothic church was soon afflicted
      by war and intestine discord, and the chieftains were divided by
      religion as well as by interest. Fritigern, the friend of the
      Romans, became the proselyte of Ulphilas; while the haughty soul
      of Athanaric disdained the yoke of the empire and of the gospel.
      The faith of the new converts was tried by the persecution which
      he excited. A wagon, bearing aloft the shapeless image of Thor,
      perhaps, or of Woden, was conducted in solemn procession through
      the streets of the camp; and the rebels, who refused to worship
      the god of their fathers, were immediately burnt, with their
      tents and families. The character of Ulphilas recommended him to
      the esteem of the Eastern court, where he twice appeared as the
      minister of peace; he pleaded the cause of the distressed Goths,
      who implored the protection of Valens; and the name of Moses was
      applied to this spiritual guide, who conducted his people through
      the deep waters of the Danube to the Land of Promise. 76 The
      devout shepherds, who were attached to his person, and tractable
      to his voice, acquiesced in their settlement, at the foot of the
      Maesian mountains, in a country of woodlands and pastures, which
      supported their flocks and herds, and enabled them to purchase
      the corn and wine of the more plentiful provinces. These harmless
      Barbarians multiplied in obscure peace and the profession of
      Christianity. 77

      Goths. He supposes that their former letters were those inscribed
      on the runes, which, being inseparably connected with the old
      idolatrous superstitions, were proscribed by the Christian
      missionaries. Everywhere the runes, so common among all the

      Their fiercer brethren, the formidable Visigoths, universally
      adopted the religion of the Romans, with whom they maintained a
      perpetual intercourse, of war, of friendship, or of conquest. In
      their long and victorious march from the Danube to the Atlantic
      Ocean, they converted their allies; they educated the rising
      generation; and the devotion which reigned in the camp of Alaric,
      or the court of Thoulouse, might edify or disgrace the palaces of
      Rome and Constantinople. 78 During the same period, Christianity
      was embraced by almost all the Barbarians, who established their
      kingdoms on the ruins of the Western empire; the Burgundians in
      Gaul, the Suevi in Spain, the Vandals in Africa, the Ostrogoths
      in Pannonia, and the various bands of mercenaries, that raised
      Odoacer to the throne of Italy. The Franks and the Saxons still
      persevered in the errors of Paganism; but the Franks obtained the
      monarchy of Gaul by their submission to the example of Clovis;
      and the Saxon conquerors of Britain were reclaimed from their
      savage superstition by the missionaries of Rome. These Barbarian
      proselytes displayed an ardent and successful zeal in the
      propagation of the faith. The Merovingian kings, and their
      successors, Charlemagne and the Othos, extended, by their laws
      and victories, the dominion of the cross. England produced the
      apostle of Germany; and the evangelic light was gradually
      diffused from the neighborhood of the Rhine, to the nations of
      the Elbe, the Vistula, and the Baltic. 79

      Chapter XXXVII: Conversion Of The Barbarians To
      Christianity.—Part III.

      The different motives which influenced the reason, or the
      passions, of the Barbarian converts, cannot easily be
      ascertained. They were often capricious and accidental; a dream,
      an omen, the report of a miracle, the example of some priest, or
      hero, the charms of a believing wife, and, above all, the
      fortunate event of a prayer, or vow, which, in a moment of
      danger, they had addressed to the God of the Christians. 80 The
      early prejudices of education were insensibly erased by the
      habits of frequent and familiar society, the moral precepts of
      the gospel were protected by the extravagant virtues of the
      monks; and a spiritual theology was supported by the visible
      power of relics, and the pomp of religious worship. But the
      rational and ingenious mode of persuasion, which a Saxon bishop
      81 suggested to a popular saint, might sometimes be employed by
      the missionaries, who labored for the conversion of infidels.
      “Admit,” says the sagacious disputant, “whatever they are pleased
      to assert of the fabulous, and carnal, genealogy of their gods
      and goddesses, who are propagated from each other. From this
      principle deduce their imperfect nature, and human infirmities,
      the assurance they were born, and the probability that they will
      die. At what time, by what means, from what cause, were the
      eldest of the gods or goddesses produced? Do they still continue,
      or have they ceased, to propagate? If they have ceased, summon
      your antagonists to declare the reason of this strange
      alteration. If they still continue, the number of the gods must
      become infinite; and shall we not risk, by the indiscreet worship
      of some impotent deity, to excite the resentment of his jealous
      superior? The visible heavens and earth, the whole system of the
      universe, which may be conceived by the mind, is it created or
      eternal? If created, how, or where, could the gods themselves
      exist before creation? If eternal, how could they assume the
      empire of an independent and preexisting world? Urge these
      arguments with temper and moderation; insinuate, at seasonable
      intervals, the truth and beauty of the Christian revelation; and
      endeavor to make the unbelievers ashamed, without making them
      angry.” This metaphysical reasoning, too refined, perhaps, for
      the Barbarians of Germany, was fortified by the grosser weight of
      authority and popular consent. The advantage of temporal
      prosperity had deserted the Pagan cause, and passed over to the
      service of Christianity. The Romans themselves, the most powerful
      and enlightened nation of the globe, had renounced their ancient
      superstition; and, if the ruin of their empire seemed to accuse
      the efficacy of the new faith, the disgrace was already retrieved
      by the conversion of the victorious Goths. The valiant and
      fortunate Barbarians, who subdued the provinces of the West,
      successively received, and reflected, the same edifying example.
      Before the age of Charlemagne, the Christian nations of Europe
      might exult in the exclusive possession of the temperate
      climates, of the fertile lands, which produced corn, wine, and
      oil; while the savage idolaters, and their helpless idols, were
      confined to the extremities of the earth, the dark and frozen
      regions of the North. 82

      80 (return) [ To such a cause has Socrates (l. vii. c. 30)

      argument; but when Daniel wrote this epistle, (A.D. 723,) the
      Mahometans, who reigned from India to Spain, might have retorted
      it against the Christians.]

      Christianity, which opened the gates of Heaven to the Barbarians,
      introduced an important change in their moral and political
      condition. They received, at the same time, the use of letters,
      so essential to a religion whose doctrines are contained in a
      sacred book; and while they studied the divine truth, their minds
      were insensibly enlarged by the distant view of history, of
      nature, of the arts, and of society. The version of the
      Scriptures into their native tongue, which had facilitated their
      conversion, must excite among their clergy some curiosity to read
      the original text, to understand the sacred liturgy of the
      church, and to examine, in the writings of the fathers, the chain
      of ecclesiastical tradition. These spiritual gifts were preserved
      in the Greek and Latin languages, which concealed the inestimable
      monuments of ancient learning. The immortal productions of
      Virgil, Cicero, and Livy, which were accessible to the Christian
      Barbarians, maintained a silent intercourse between the reign of
      Augustus and the times of Clovis and Charlemagne. The emulation
      of mankind was encouraged by the remembrance of a more perfect
      state; and the flame of science was secretly kept alive, to warm
      and enlighten the mature age of the Western world.

      In the most corrupt state of Christianity, the Barbarians might
      learn justice from the law, and mercy from the gospel; and if the
      knowledge of their duty was insufficient to guide their actions,
      or to regulate their passions, they were sometimes restrained by
      conscience, and frequently punished by remorse. But the direct
      authority of religion was less effectual than the holy communion,
      which united them with their Christian brethren in spiritual
      friendship. The influence of these sentiments contributed to
      secure their fidelity in the service, or the alliance, of the
      Romans, to alleviate the horrors of war, to moderate the
      insolence of conquest, and to preserve, in the downfall of the
      empire, a permanent respect for the name and institutions of
      Rome. In the days of Paganism, the priests of Gaul and Germany
      reigned over the people, and controlled the jurisdiction of the
      magistrates; and the zealous proselytes transferred an equal, or
      more ample, measure of devout obedience, to the pontiffs of the
      Christian faith. The sacred character of the bishops was
      supported by their temporal possessions; they obtained an
      honorable seat in the legislative assemblies of soldiers and
      freemen; and it was their interest, as well as their duty, to
      mollify, by peaceful counsels, the fierce spirit of the
      Barbarians. The perpetual correspondence of the Latin clergy, the
      frequent pilgrimages to Rome and Jerusalem, and the growing
      authority of the popes, cemented the union of the Christian
      republic, and gradually produced the similar manners, and common
      jurisprudence, which have distinguished, from the rest of
      mankind, the independent, and even hostile, nations of modern
      Europe.

      But the operation of these causes was checked and retarded by the
      unfortunate accident, which infused a deadly poison into the cup
      of Salvation. Whatever might be the early sentiments of Ulphilas,
      his connections with the empire and the church were formed during
      the reign of Arianism. The apostle of the Goths subscribed the
      creed of Rimini; professed with freedom, and perhaps with
      sincerity, that the Son was not equal, or consubstantial to the
      Father; 83 communicated these errors to the clergy and people;
      and infected the Barbaric world with a heresy, 84 which the great
      Theodosius proscribed and extinguished among the Romans. The
      temper and understanding of the new proselytes were not adapted
      to metaphysical subtilties; but they strenuously maintained, what
      they had piously received, as the pure and genuine doctrines of
      Christianity. The advantage of preaching and expounding the
      Scriptures in the Teutonic language promoted the apostolic labors
      of Ulphilas and his successors; and they ordained a competent
      number of bishops and presbyters for the instruction of the
      kindred tribes. The Ostrogoths, the Burgundians, the Suevi, and
      the Vandals, who had listened to the eloquence of the Latin
      clergy, 85 preferred the more intelligible lessons of their
      domestic teachers; and Arianism was adopted as the national faith
      of the warlike converts, who were seated on the ruins of the
      Western empire. This irreconcilable difference of religion was a
      perpetual source of jealousy and hatred; and the reproach of
      Barbarian was imbittered by the more odious epithet of Heretic.
      The heroes of the North, who had submitted, with some reluctance,
      to believe that all their ancestors were in hell, 86 were
      astonished and exasperated to learn, that they themselves had
      only changed the mode of their eternal condemnation. Instead of
      the smooth applause, which Christian kings are accustomed to
      expect from their royal prelates, the orthodox bishops and their
      clergy were in a state of opposition to the Arian courts; and
      their indiscreet opposition frequently became criminal, and might
      sometimes be dangerous. 87 The pulpit, that safe and sacred organ
      of sedition, resounded with the names of Pharaoh and Holofernes;
      88 the public discontent was inflamed by the hope or promise of a
      glorious deliverance; and the seditious saints were tempted to
      promote the accomplishment of their own predictions.
      Notwithstanding these provocations, the Catholics of Gaul, Spain,
      and Italy, enjoyed, under the reign of the Arians, the free and
      peaceful exercise of their religion. Their haughty masters
      respected the zeal of a numerous people, resolved to die at the
      foot of their altars; and the example of their devout constancy
      was admired and imitated by the Barbarians themselves. The
      conquerors evaded, however, the disgraceful reproach, or
      confession, of fear, by attributing their toleration to the
      liberal motives of reason and humanity; and while they affected
      the language, they imperceptiby imbibed the spirit, of genuine
      Christianity.

      with which he punished such indiscreet allusions. Victor
      Vitensis, l. 7, p. 10.]

      The peace of the church was sometimes interrupted. The Catholics
      were indiscreet, the Barbarians were impatient; and the partial
      acts of severity or injustice, which had been recommended by the
      Arian clergy, were exaggerated by the orthodox writers. The guilt
      of persecution may be imputed to Euric, king of the Visigoths;
      who suspended the exercise of ecclesiastical, or, at least, of
      episcopal functions; and punished the popular bishops of Aquitain
      with imprisonment, exile, and confiscation. 89 But the cruel and
      absurd enterprise of subduing the minds of a whole people was
      undertaken by the Vandals alone. Genseric himself, in his early
      youth, had renounced the orthodox communion; and the apostate
      could neither grant, nor expect, a sincere forgiveness. He was
      exasperated to find that the Africans, who had fled before him in
      the field, still presumed to dispute his will in synods and
      churches; and his ferocious mind was incapable of fear or of
      compassion. His Catholic subjects were oppressed by intolerant
      laws and arbitrary punishments. The language of Genseric was
      furious and formidable; the knowledge of his intentions might
      justify the most unfavorable interpretation of his actions; and
      the Arians were reproached with the frequent executions which
      stained the palace and the dominions of the tyrant. Arms and
      ambition were, however, the ruling passions of the monarch of the
      sea. But Hunneric, his inglorious son, who seemed to inherit only
      his vices, tormented the Catholics with the same unrelenting fury
      which had been fatal to his brother, his nephews, and the friends
      and favorites of his father; and even to the Arian patriarch, who
      was inhumanly burnt alive in the midst of Carthage. The religious
      war was preceded and prepared by an insidious truce; persecution
      was made the serious and important business of the Vandal court;
      and the loathsome disease which hastened the death of Hunneric,
      revenged the injuries, without contributing to the deliverance,
      of the church. The throne of Africa was successively filled by
      the two nephews of Hunneric; by Gundamund, who reigned about
      twelve, and by Thrasimund, who governed the nation about
      twenty-seven, years. Their administration was hostile and
      oppressive to the orthodox party. Gundamund appeared to emulate,
      or even to surpass, the cruelty of his uncle; and, if at length
      he relented, if he recalled the bishops, and restored the freedom
      of Athanasian worship, a premature death intercepted the benefits
      of his tardy clemency. His brother, Thrasimund, was the greatest
      and most accomplished of the Vandal kings, whom he excelled in
      beauty, prudence, and magnanimity of soul. But this magnanimous
      character was degraded by his intolerant zeal and deceitful
      clemency. Instead of threats and tortures, he employed the
      gentle, but efficacious, powers of seduction. Wealth, dignity,
      and the royal favor, were the liberal rewards of apostasy; the
      Catholics, who had violated the laws, might purchase their pardon
      by the renunciation of their faith; and whenever Thrasimund
      meditated any rigorous measure, he patiently waited till the
      indiscretion of his adversaries furnished him with a specious
      opportunity. Bigotry was his last sentiment in the hour of death;
      and he exacted from his successor a solemn oath, that he would
      never tolerate the sectaries of Athanasius. But his successor,
      Hilderic, the gentle son of the savage Hunneric, preferred the
      duties of humanity and justice to the vain obligation of an
      impious oath; and his accession was gloriously marked by the
      restoration of peace and universal freedom. The throne of that
      virtuous, though feeble monarch, was usurped by his cousin
      Gelimer, a zealous Arian: but the Vandal kingdom, before he could
      enjoy or abuse his power, was subverted by the arms of
      Belisarius; and the orthodox party retaliated the injuries which
      they had endured. 90

      the persecution of Thrasimund (in Biblioth. Max. Patrum, tom. ix.
      p. 4-16;) and in the first book of the Vandalic War, by the
      impartial Procopius, (c. 7, 8, p. 196, 197, 198, 199.) Dom
      Ruinart, the last editor of Victor, has illustrated the whole
      subject with a copious and learned apparatus of notes and
      supplement (Paris, 1694.)]

      The passionate declamations of the Catholics, the sole historians
      of this persecution, cannot afford any distinct series of causes
      and events; any impartial view of the characters, or counsels;
      but the most remarkable circumstances that deserve either credit
      or notice, may be referred to the following heads; I. In the
      original law, which is still extant, 91 Hunneric expressly
      declares, (and the declaration appears to be correct,) that he
      had faithfully transcribed the regulations and penalties of the
      Imperial edicts, against the heretical congregations, the clergy,
      and the people, who dissented from the established religion. If
      the rights of conscience had been understood, the Catholics must
      have condemned their past conduct or acquiesced in their actual
      suffering. But they still persisted to refuse the indulgence
      which they claimed. While they trembled under the lash of
      persecution, they praised the laudable severity of Hunneric
      himself, who burnt or banished great numbers of Manichæans; 92
      and they rejected, with horror, the ignominious compromise, that
      the disciples of Arius and of Athanasius should enjoy a
      reciprocal and similar toleration in the territories of the
      Romans, and in those of the Vandals. 93 II. The practice of a
      conference, which the Catholics had so frequently used to insult
      and punish their obstinate antagonists, was retorted against
      themselves. 94 At the command of Hunneric, four hundred and
      sixty-six orthodox bishops assembled at Carthage; but when they
      were admitted into the hall of audience, they had the
      mortification of beholding the Arian Cyrila exalted on the
      patriarchal throne. The disputants were separated, after the
      mutual and ordinary reproaches of noise and silence, of delay and
      precipitation, of military force and of popular clamor. One
      martyr and one confessor were selected among the Catholic
      bishops; twenty-eight escaped by flight, and eighty-eight by
      conformity; forty-six were sent into Corsica to cut timber for
      the royal navy; and three hundred and two were banished to the
      different parts of Africa, exposed to the insults of their
      enemies, and carefully deprived of all the temporal and spiritual
      comforts of life. 95 The hardships of ten years’ exile must have
      reduced their numbers; and if they had complied with the law of
      Thrasimund, which prohibited any episcopal consecrations, the
      orthodox church of Africa must have expired with the lives of its
      actual members. They disobeyed, and their disobedience was
      punished by a second exile of two hundred and twenty bishops into
      Sardinia; where they languished fifteen years, till the accession
      of the gracious Hilderic. 96 The two islands were judiciously
      chosen by the malice of their Arian tyrants. Seneca, from his own
      experience, has deplored and exaggerated the miserable state of
      Corsica, 97 and the plenty of Sardinia was overbalanced by the
      unwholesome quality of the air. 98 III. The zeal of Genseric and
      his successors, for the conversion of the Catholics, must have
      rendered them still more jealous to guard the purity of the
      Vandal faith. Before the churches were finally shut, it was a
      crime to appear in a Barbarian dress; and those who presumed to
      neglect the royal mandate were rudely dragged backwards by their
      long hair. 99 The palatine officers, who refused to profess the
      religion of their prince, were ignominiously stripped of their
      honors and employments; banished to Sardinia and Sicily; or
      condemned to the servile labors of slaves and peasants in the
      fields of Utica. In the districts which had been peculiarly
      allotted to the Vandals, the exercise of the Catholic worship was
      more strictly prohibited; and severe penalties were denounced
      against the guilt both of the missionary and the proselyte. By
      these arts, the faith of the Barbarians was preserved, and their
      zeal was inflamed: they discharged, with devout fury, the office
      of spies, informers, or executioners; and whenever their cavalry
      took the field, it was the favorite amusement of the march to
      defile the churches, and to insult the clergy of the adverse
      faction. 100 IV. The citizens who had been educated in the luxury
      of the Roman province, were delivered, with exquisite cruelty, to
      the Moors of the desert. A venerable train of bishops,
      presbyters, and deacons, with a faithful crowd of four thousand
      and ninety-six persons, whose guilt is not precisely ascertained,
      were torn from their native homes, by the command of Hunneric.
      During the night they were confined, like a herd of cattle,
      amidst their own ordure: during the day they pursued their march
      over the burning sands; and if they fainted under the heat and
      fatigue, they were goaded, or dragged along, till they expired in
      the hands of their tormentors. 101 These unhappy exiles, when
      they reached the Moorish huts, might excite the compassion of a
      people, whose native humanity was neither improved by reason, nor
      corrupted by fanaticism: but if they escaped the dangers, they
      were condemned to share the distress of a savage life. V. It is
      incumbent on the authors of persecution previously to reflect,
      whether they are determined to support it in the last extreme.
      They excite the flame which they strive to extinguish; and it
      soon becomes necessary to chastise the contumacy, as well as the
      crime, of the offender. The fine, which he is unable or unwilling
      to discharge, exposes his person to the severity of the law; and
      his contempt of lighter penalties suggests the use and propriety
      of capital punishment. Through the veil of fiction and
      declamation we may clearly perceive, that the Catholics more
      especially under the reign of Hunneric, endured the most cruel
      and ignominious treatment. 102 Respectable citizens, noble
      matrons, and consecrated virgins, were stripped naked, and raised
      in the air by pulleys, with a weight suspended at their feet. In
      this painful attitude their naked bodies were torn with scourges,
      or burnt in the most tender parts with red-hot plates of iron.
      The amputation of the ears the nose, the tongue, and the right
      hand, was inflicted by the Arians; and although the precise
      number cannot be defined, it is evident that many persons, among
      whom a bishop 103 and a proconsul 104 may be named, were entitled
      to the crown of martyrdom. The same honor has been ascribed to
      the memory of Count Sebastian, who professed the Nicene creed
      with unshaken constancy; and Genseric might detest, as a heretic,
      the brave and ambitious fugitive whom he dreaded as a rival. 105
      VI. A new mode of conversion, which might subdue the feeble, and
      alarm the timorous, was employed by the Arian ministers. They
      imposed, by fraud or violence, the rites of baptism; and punished
      the apostasy of the Catholics, if they disclaimed this odious and
      profane ceremony, which scandalously violated the freedom of the
      will, and the unity of the sacrament. 106 The hostile sects had
      formerly allowed the validity of each other’s baptism; and the
      innovation, so fiercely maintained by the Vandals, can be imputed
      only to the example and advice of the Donatists. VII. The Arian
      clergy surpassed in religious cruelty the king and his Vandals;
      but they were incapable of cultivating the spiritual vineyard,
      which they were so desirous to possess. A patriarch 107 might
      seat himself on the throne of Carthage; some bishops, in the
      principal cities, might usurp the place of their rivals; but the
      smallness of their numbers, and their ignorance of the Latin
      language, 108 disqualified the Barbarians for the ecclesiastical
      ministry of a great church; and the Africans, after the loss of
      their orthodox pastors, were deprived of the public exercise of
      Christianity. VIII. The emperors were the natural protectors of
      the Homoousian doctrine; and the faithful people of Africa, both
      as Romans and as Catholics, preferred their lawful sovereignty to
      the usurpation of the Barbarous heretics. During an interval of
      peace and friendship, Hunneric restored the cathedral of
      Carthage; at the intercession of Zeno, who reigned in the East,
      and of Placidia, the daughter and relict of emperors, and the
      sister of the queen of the Vandals. 109 But this decent regard
      was of short duration; and the haughty tyrant displayed his
      contempt for the religion of the empire, by studiously arranging
      the bloody images of persecution, in all the principal streets
      through which the Roman ambassador must pass in his way to the
      palace. 110 An oath was required from the bishops, who were
      assembled at Carthage, that they would support the succession of
      his son Hilderic, and that they would renounce all foreign or
      transmarine correspondence. This engagement, consistent, as it
      should seem, with their moral and religious duties, was refused
      by the more sagacious members 111 of the assembly. Their refusal,
      faintly colored by the pretence that it is unlawful for a
      Christian to swear, must provoke the suspicions of a jealous
      tyrant.

      Chapter XXXVII: Conversion Of The Barbarians To
      Christianity.—Part IV.

      The Catholics, oppressed by royal and military force, were far
      superior to their adversaries in numbers and learning. With the
      same weapons which the Greek 112 and Latin fathers had already
      provided for the Arian controversy, they repeatedly silenced, or
      vanquished, the fierce and illiterate successors of Ulphilas. The
      consciousness of their own superiority might have raised them
      above the arts and passions of religious warfare. Yet, instead of
      assuming such honorable pride, the orthodox theologians were
      tempted, by the assurance of impunity, to compose fictions, which
      must be stigmatized with the epithets of fraud and forgery. They
      ascribed their own polemical works to the most venerable names of
      Christian antiquity; the characters of Athanasius and Augustin
      were awkwardly personated by Vigilius and his disciples; 113 and
      the famous creed, which so clearly expounds the mysteries of the
      Trinity and the Incarnation, is deduced, with strong probability,
      from this African school. 114 Even the Scriptures themselves were
      profaned by their rash and sacrilegious hands. The memorable
      text, which asserts the unity of the three who bear witness in
      heaven, 115 is condemned by the universal silence of the orthodox
      fathers, ancient versions, and authentic manuscripts. 116 It was
      first alleged by the Catholic bishops whom Hunneric summoned to
      the conference of Carthage. 117 An allegorical interpretation, in
      the form, perhaps, of a marginal note, invaded the text of the
      Latin Bibles, which were renewed and corrected in a dark period
      of ten centuries. 118 After the invention of printing, 119 the
      editors of the Greek Testament yielded to their own prejudices,
      or those of the times; 120 and the pious fraud, which was
      embraced with equal zeal at Rome and at Geneva, has been
      infinitely multiplied in every country and every language of
      modern Europe.

      112 (return) [ Fulgentius, bishop of Ruspae, in the Byzacene

      munificence of Cardinal Ximenes. The Complutensian Polyglot cost

      Greek Testaments by the prudence of Erasmus; the honest bigotry
      of the Complutensian editors; the typographical fraud, or error,
      of Robert Stephens, in the placing a crotchet; and the deliberate
      falsehood, or strange misapprehension, of Theodore Beza.]

      The example of fraud must excite suspicion: and the specious
      miracles by which the African Catholics have defended the truth
      and justice of their cause, may be ascribed, with more reason, to
      their own industry, than to the visible protection of Heaven. Yet
      the historian, who views this religious conflict with an
      impartial eye, may condescend to mention one preternatural event,
      which will edify the devout, and surprise the incredulous.
      Tipasa, 121 a maritime colony of Mauritania, sixteen miles to the
      east of Caesarea, had been distinguished, in every age, by the
      orthodox zeal of its inhabitants. They had braved the fury of the
      Donatists; 122 they resisted, or eluded, the tyranny of the
      Arians. The town was deserted on the approach of an heretical
      bishop: most of the inhabitants who could procure ships passed
      over to the coast of Spain; and the unhappy remnant, refusing all
      communion with the usurper, still presumed to hold their pious,
      but illegal, assemblies. Their disobedience exasperated the
      cruelty of Hunneric. A military count was despatched from
      Carthage to Tipasa: he collected the Catholics in the Forum, and,
      in the presence of the whole province, deprived the guilty of
      their right hands and their tongues. But the holy confessors
      continued to speak without tongues; and this miracle is attested
      by Victor, an African bishop, who published a history of the
      persecution within two years after the event. 123 “If any one,”
      says Victor, “should doubt of the truth, let him repair to
      Constantinople, and listen to the clear and perfect language of
      Restitutus, the sub-deacon, one of these glorious sufferers, who
      is now lodged in the palace of the emperor Zeno, and is respected
      by the devout empress.” At Constantinople we are astonished to
      find a cool, a learned, and unexceptionable witness, without
      interest, and without passion. Aeneas of Gaza, a Platonic
      philosopher, has accurately described his own observations on
      these African sufferers. “I saw them myself: I heard them speak:
      I diligently inquired by what means such an articulate voice
      could be formed without any organ of speech: I used my eyes to
      examine the report of my ears; I opened their mouth, and saw that
      the whole tongue had been completely torn away by the roots; an
      operation which the physicians generally suppose to be mortal.”
      124 The testimony of Aeneas of Gaza might be confirmed by the
      superfluous evidence of the emperor Justinian, in a perpetual
      edict; of Count Marcellinus, in his Chronicle of the times; and
      of Pope Gregory the First, who had resided at Constantinople, as
      the minister of the Roman pontiff. 125 They all lived within the
      compass of a century; and they all appeal to their personal
      knowledge, or the public notoriety, for the truth of a miracle,
      which was repeated in several instances, displayed on the
      greatest theatre of the world, and submitted, during a series of
      years, to the calm examination of the senses. This supernatural
      gift of the African confessors, who spoke without tongues, will
      command the assent of those, and of those only, who already
      believe, that their language was pure and orthodox. But the
      stubborn mind of an infidel, is guarded by secret, incurable
      suspicion; and the Arian, or Socinian, who has seriously rejected
      the doctrine of a Trinity, will not be shaken by the most
      plausible evidence of an Athanasian miracle.

      miracle is enhanced by the singular instance of a boy who had
      never spoken before his tongue was cut out. ]

      The Vandals and the Ostrogoths persevered in the profession of
      Arianism till the final ruin of the kingdoms which they had
      founded in Africa and Italy. The Barbarians of Gaul submitted to
      the orthodox dominion of the Franks; and Spain was restored to
      the Catholic church by the voluntary conversion of the Visigoths.

      This salutary revolution 126 was hastened by the example of a
      royal martyr, whom our calmer reason may style an ungrateful
      rebel. Leovigild, the Gothic monarch of Spain, deserved the
      respect of his enemies, and the love of his subjects; the
      Catholics enjoyed a free toleration, and his Arian synods
      attempted, without much success, to reconcile their scruples by
      abolishing the unpopular rite of a second baptism. His eldest son
      Hermenegild, who was invested by his father with the royal
      diadem, and the fair principality of Boetica, contracted an
      honorable and orthodox alliance with a Merovingian princess, the
      daughter of Sigebert, king of Austrasia, and of the famous
      Brunechild. The beauteous Ingundis, who was no more than thirteen
      years of age, was received, beloved, and persecuted, in the Arian
      court of Toledo; and her religious constancy was alternately
      assaulted with blandishments and violence by Goisvintha, the
      Gothic queen, who abused the double claim of maternal authority.
      127 Incensed by her resistance, Goisvintha seized the Catholic
      princess by her long hair, inhumanly dashed her against the
      ground, kicked her till she was covered with blood, and at last
      gave orders that she should be stripped, and thrown into a basin,
      or fish-pond. 128 Love and honor might excite Hermenegild to
      resent this injurious treatment of his bride; and he was
      gradually persuaded that Ingundis suffered for the cause of
      divine truth. Her tender complaints, and the weighty arguments of
      Leander, archbishop of Seville, accomplished his conversion and
      the heir of the Gothic monarchy was initiated in the Nicene faith
      by the solemn rites of confirmation. 129 The rash youth, inflamed
      by zeal, and perhaps by ambition, was tempted to violate the
      duties of a son and a subject; and the Catholics of Spain,
      although they could not complain of persecution, applauded his
      pious rebellion against an heretical father. The civil war was
      protracted by the long and obstinate sieges of Merida, Cordova,
      and Seville, which had strenuously espoused the party of
      Hermenegild. He invited the orthodox Barbarians, the Seuvi, and
      the Franks, to the destruction of his native land; he solicited
      the dangerous aid of the Romans, who possessed Africa, and a part
      of the Spanish coast; and his holy ambassador, the archbishop
      Leander, effectually negotiated in person with the Byzantine
      court. But the hopes of the Catholics were crushed by the active
      diligence of the monarch who commanded the troops and treasures
      of Spain; and the guilty Hermenegild, after his vain attempts to
      resist or to escape, was compelled to surrender himself into the
      hands of an incensed father. Leovigild was still mindful of that
      sacred character; and the rebel, despoiled of the regal
      ornaments, was still permitted, in a decent exile, to profess the
      Catholic religion. His repeated and unsuccessful treasons at
      length provoked the indignation of the Gothic king; and the
      sentence of death, which he pronounced with apparent reluctance,
      was privately executed in the tower of Seville. The inflexible
      constancy with which he refused to accept the Arian communion, as
      the price of his safety, may excuse the honors that have been
      paid to the memory of St. Hermenegild. His wife and infant son
      were detained by the Romans in ignominious captivity; and this
      domestic misfortune tarnished the glories of Leovigild, and
      imbittered the last moments of his life.

      were the issue of a former marriage.]

      and marvellous prerogatives both visible and invisible. See
      Chardon. Hist. des Sacremens, tom. 1. p. 405-552.]

      His son and successor, Recared, the first Catholic king of Spain,
      had imbibed the faith of his unfortunate brother, which he
      supported with more prudence and success. Instead of revolting
      against his father, Recared patiently expected the hour of his
      death. Instead of condemning his memory, he piously supposed,
      that the dying monarch had abjured the errors of Arianism, and
      recommended to his son the conversion of the Gothic nation. To
      accomplish that salutary end, Recared convened an assembly of the
      Arian clergy and nobles, declared himself a Catholic, and
      exhorted them to imitate the example of their prince. The
      laborious interpretation of doubtful texts, or the curious
      pursuit of metaphysical arguments, would have excited an endless
      controversy; and the monarch discreetly proposed to his
      illiterate audience two substantial and visible arguments,—the
      testimony of Earth, and of Heaven. The Earth had submitted to the
      Nicene synod: the Romans, the Barbarians, and the inhabitants of
      Spain, unanimously professed the same orthodox creed; and the
      Visigoths resisted, almost alone, the consent of the Christian
      world. A superstitious age was prepared to reverence, as the
      testimony of Heaven, the preternatural cures, which were
      performed by the skill or virtue of the Catholic clergy; the
      baptismal fonts of Osset in Boetica, 130 which were spontaneously
      replenished every year, on the vigil of Easter; 131 and the
      miraculous shrine of St. Martin of Tours, which had already
      converted the Suevic prince and people of Gallicia. 132 The
      Catholic king encountered some difficulties on this important
      change of the national religion. A conspiracy, secretly fomented
      by the queen-dowager, was formed against his life; and two counts
      excited a dangerous revolt in the Narbonnese Gaul. But Recared
      disarmed the conspirators, defeated the rebels, and executed
      severe justice; which the Arians, in their turn, might brand with
      the reproach of persecution. Eight bishops, whose names betray
      their Barbaric origin, abjured their errors; and all the books of
      Arian theology were reduced to ashes, with the house in which
      they had been purposely collected. The whole body of the
      Visigoths and Suevi were allured or driven into the pale of the
      Catholic communion; the faith, at least of the rising generation,
      was fervent and sincere: and the devout liberality of the
      Barbarians enriched the churches and monasteries of Spain.
      Seventy bishops, assembled in the council of Toledo, received the
      submission of their conquerors; and the zeal of the Spaniards
      improved the Nicene creed, by declaring the procession of the
      Holy Ghost from the Son, as well as from the Father; a weighty
      point of doctrine, which produced, long afterwards, the schism of
      the Greek and Latin churches. 133 The royal proselyte immediately
      saluted and consulted Pope Gregory, surnamed the Great, a learned
      and holy prelate, whose reign was distinguished by the conversion
      of heretics and infidels. The ambassadors of Recared respectfully
      offered on the threshold of the Vatican his rich presents of gold
      and gems; they accepted, as a lucrative exchange, the hairs of
      St. John the Baptist; a cross, which enclosed a small piece of
      the true wood; and a key, that contained some particles of iron
      which had been scraped from the chains of St. Peter. 134

      130 (return) [ Osset, or Julia Constantia, was opposite to

      The same Gregory, the spiritual conqueror of Britain, encouraged
      the pious Theodelinda, queen of the Lombards, to propagate the
      Nicene faith among the victorious savages, whose recent
      Christianity was polluted by the Arian heresy. Her devout labors
      still left room for the industry and success of future
      missionaries; and many cities of Italy were still disputed by
      hostile bishops. But the cause of Arianism was gradually
      suppressed by the weight of truth, of interest, and of example;
      and the controversy, which Egypt had derived from the Platonic
      school, was terminated, after a war of three hundred years, by
      the final conversion of the Lombards of Italy. 135

      135 (return) [ Paul Warnefrid (de Gestis Langobard. l. iv. c. 44,
      p. 153, edit Grot.) allows that Arianism still prevailed under
      the reign of Rotharis, (A.D. 636-652.) The pious deacon does not
      attempt to mark the precise era of the national conversion, which
      was accomplished, however, before the end of the seventh
      century.]

      The first missionaries who preached the gospel to the Barbarians,
      appealed to the evidence of reason, and claimed the benefit of
      toleration. 136 But no sooner had they established their
      spiritual dominion, than they exhorted the Christian kings to
      extirpate, without mercy, the remains of Roman or Barbaric
      superstition. The successors of Clovis inflicted one hundred
      lashes on the peasants who refused to destroy their idols; the
      crime of sacrificing to the demons was punished by the
      Anglo-Saxon laws with the heavier penalties of imprisonment and
      confiscation; and even the wise Alfred adopted, as an
      indispensable duty, the extreme rigor of the Mosaic institutions.
      137 But the punishment and the crime were gradually abolished
      among a Christian people; the theological disputes of the schools
      were suspended by propitious ignorance; and the intolerant spirit
      which could find neither idolaters nor heretics, was reduced to
      the persecution of the Jews. That exiled nation had founded some
      synagogues in the cities of Gaul; but Spain, since the time of
      Hadrian, was filled with their numerous colonies. 138 The wealth
      which they accumulated by trade, and the management of the
      finances, invited the pious avarice of their masters; and they
      might be oppressed without danger, as they had lost the use, and
      even the remembrance, of arms. Sisebut, a Gothic king, who
      reigned in the beginning of the seventh century, proceeded at
      once to the last extremes of persecution. 139 Ninety thousand
      Jews were compelled to receive the sacrament of baptism; the
      fortunes of the obstinate infidels were confiscated, their bodies
      were tortured; and it seems doubtful whether they were permitted
      to abandon their native country. The excessive zeal of the
      Catholic king was moderated, even by the clergy of Spain, who
      solemnly pronounced an inconsistent sentence: that the sacraments
      should not be forcibly imposed; but that the Jews who had been
      baptized should be constrained, for the honor of the church, to
      persevere in the external practice of a religion which they
      disbelieved and detested. Their frequent relapses provoked one of
      the successors of Sisebut to banish the whole nation from his
      dominions; and a council of Toledo published a decree, that every
      Gothic king should swear to maintain this salutary edict. But the
      tyrants were unwilling to dismiss the victims, whom they
      delighted to torture, or to deprive themselves of the industrious
      slaves, over whom they might exercise a lucrative oppression. The
      Jews still continued in Spain, under the weight of the civil and
      ecclesiastical laws, which in the same country have been
      faithfully transcribed in the Code of the Inquisition. The Gothic
      kings and bishops at length discovered, that injuries will
      produce hatred, and that hatred will find the opportunity of
      revenge. A nation, the secret or professed enemies of
      Christianity, still multiplied in servitude and distress; and the
      intrigues of the Jews promoted the rapid success of the Arabian
      conquerors. 140

      As soon as the Barbarians withdrew their powerful support, the
      unpopular heresy of Arius sunk into contempt and oblivion. But
      the Greeks still retained their subtle and loquacious
      disposition: the establishment of an obscure doctrine suggested
      new questions, and new disputes; and it was always in the power
      of an ambitious prelate, or a fanatic monk, to violate the peace
      of the church, and, perhaps, of the empire. The historian of the
      empire may overlook those disputes which were confined to the
      obscurity of schools and synods. The Manichæans, who labored to
      reconcile the religions of Christ and of Zoroaster, had secretly
      introduced themselves into the provinces: but these foreign
      sectaries were involved in the common disgrace of the Gnostics,
      and the Imperial laws were executed by the public hatred. The
      rational opinions of the Pelagians were propagated from Britain
      to Rome, Africa, and Palestine, and silently expired in a
      superstitious age. But the East was distracted by the Nestorian
      and Eutychian controversies; which attempted to explain the
      mystery of the incarnation, and hastened the ruin of Christianity
      in her native land. These controversies were first agitated under
      the reign of the younger Theodosius: but their important
      consequences extend far beyond the limits of the present volume.
      The metaphysical chain of argument, the contests of
      ecclesiastical ambition, and their political influence on the
      decline of the Byzantine empire, may afford an interesting and
      instructive series of history, from the general councils of
      Ephesus and Chalcedon, to the conquest of the East by the
      successors of Mahomet.
