      Note: In the notes to this important chapter, which is received
      as the text-book on Civil Law in some of the foreign
      universities, I have consulted,

      I. the newly-discovered Institutes of Gaius, (Gaii Institutiones,
      ed. Goeschen, Berlin, 1824,) with some other fragments of the
      Roman law, (Codicis Theodosiani Fragmenta inedita, ab Amadeo
      Peyron. Turin, 1824.)

      II. The History of the Roman Law, by Professor Hugo, in the
      French translation of M. Jourdan. Paris, 1825.

      III. Savigny, Geschichte des Romischen Rechts im Mittelalter, 6
      bande, Heidelberg, 1815.

      IV. Walther, Romische Rechts-Geschichte, Bonn. 1834. But I am
      particularly indebted to an edition of the French translation of
      this chapter, with additional notes, by one of the most learned
      civilians of Europe, Professor Warnkonig, published at Liege,
      1821. I have inserted almost the whole of these notes, which are
      distinguished by the letter W.—M. The vain titles of the
      victories of Justinian are crumbled into dust; but the name of
      the legislator is inscribed on a fair and everlasting monument.
      Under his reign, and by his care, the civil jurisprudence was
      digested in the immortal works of the Code, the Pandects, and the
      Institutes: 1 the public reason of the Romans has been silently
      or studiously transfused into the domestic institutions of
      Europe, 2, and the laws of Justinian still command the respect or
      obedience of independent nations. Wise or fortunate is the prince
      who connects his own reputation with the honor or interest of a
      perpetual order of men. The defence of their founder is the first
      cause, which in every age has exercised the zeal and industry of
      the civilians. They piously commemorate his virtues; dissemble or
      deny his failings; and fiercely chastise the guilt or folly of
      the rebels, who presume to sully the majesty of the purple. The
      idolatry of love has provoked, as it usually happens, the rancor
      of opposition; the character of Justinian has been exposed to the
      blind vehemence of flattery and invective; and the injustice of a
      sect (the Anti-Tribonians,) has refused all praise and merit to
      the prince, his ministers, and his laws. 3 Attached to no party,
      interested only for the truth and candor of history, and directed
      by the most temperate and skilful guides, 4 I enter with just
      diffidence on the subject of civil law, which has exhausted so
      many learned lives, and clothed the walls of such spacious
      libraries. In a single, if possible in a short, chapter, I shall
      trace the Roman jurisprudence from Romulus to Justinian, 5
      appreciate the labors of that emperor, and pause to contemplate
      the principles of a science so important to the peace and
      happiness of society. The laws of a nation form the most
      instructive portion of its history; and although I have devoted
      myself to write the annals of a declining monarchy, I shall
      embrace the occasion to breathe the pure and invigorating air of
      the republic.

      1 (return) [ The civilians of the darker ages have established an
      absurd and incomprehensible mode of quotation, which is supported
      by authority and custom. In their references to the Code, the
      Pandects, and the Institutes, they mention the number, not of the
      book, but only of the law; and content themselves with reciting
      the first words of the title to which it belongs; and of these
      titles there are more than a thousand. Ludewig (Vit. Justiniani,
      p. 268) wishes to shake off this pendantic yoke; and I have dared
      to adopt the simple and rational method of numbering the book,
      the title, and the law. Note: The example of Gibbon has been
      followed by M Hugo and other civilians.—M]

      2 (return) [ Germany, Bohemia, Hungary, Poland, and Scotland,
      have received them as common law or reason; in France, Italy,
      &c., they possess a direct or indirect influence; and they were
      respected in England, from Stephen to Edward I. our national
      Justinian, (Duck. de Usu et Auctoritate Juris Civilis, l. ii. c.
      1, 8—15. Heineccius, Hist. Juris Germanici, c. 3, 4, No. 55-124,
      and the legal historians of each country.) * Note: Although the
      restoration of the Roman law, introduced by the revival of this
      study in Italy, is one of the most important branches of history,
      it had been treated but imperfectly when Gibbon wrote his work.
      That of Arthur Duck is but an insignificant performance. But the
      researches of the learned have thrown much light upon the matter.
      The Sarti, the Tiraboschi, the Fantuzzi, the Savioli, had made
      some very interesting inquiries; but it was reserved for M. de
      Savigny, in a work entitled “The History of the Roman Law during
      the Middle Ages,” to cast the strongest right on this part of
      history. He demonstrates incontestably the preservation of the
      Roman law from Justinian to the time of the Glossators, who by
      their indefatigable zeal, propagated the study of the Roman
      jurisprudence in all the countries of Europe. It is much to be
      desired that the author should continue this interesting work,
      and that the learned should engage in the inquiry in what manner
      the Roman law introduced itself into their respective countries,
      and the authority which it progressively acquired. For Belgium,
      there exists, on this subject, (proposed by the Academy of
      Brussels in 1781,) a Collection of Memoirs, printed at Brussels
      in 4to., 1783, among which should be distinguished those of M. de
      Berg. M. Berriat Saint Prix has given us hopes of the speedy
      appearance of a work in which he will discuss this question,
      especially in relation to France. M. Spangenberg, in his
      Introduction to the Study of the Corpus Juris Civilis Hanover,
      1817, 1 vol. 8vo. p. 86, 116, gives us a general sketch of the
      history of the Roman law in different parts of Europe. We cannot
      avoid mentioning an elementary work by M. Hugo, in which he
      treats of the History of the Roman Law from Justinian to the
      present Time, 2d edit. Berlin 1818 W.]

      3 (return) [ Francis Hottoman, a learned and acute lawyer of the
      xvith century, wished to mortify Cujacius, and to please the
      Chancellor de l’Hopital. His Anti-Tribonianus (which I have never
      been able to procure) was published in French in 1609; and his
      sect was propagated in Germany, (Heineccius, Op. tom. iii.
      sylloge iii. p. 171—183.) * Note: Though there have always been
      many detractors of the Roman law, no sect of Anti-Tribonians has
      ever existed under that name, as Gibbon seems to suppose.—W.]

      4 (return) [ At the head of these guides I shall respectfully
      place the learned and perspicuous Heineccius, a German professor,
      who died at Halle in the year 1741, (see his Eloge in the
      Nouvelle Bibliotheque Germanique, tom. ii. p. 51—64.) His ample
      works have been collected in eight volumes in 4to. Geneva,
      1743-1748. The treatises which I have separately used are, 1.
      Historia Juris Romani et Germanici, Lugd. Batav. 1740, in 8 vo.
      2. Syntagma Antiquitatum Romanam Jurisprudentiam illustrantium, 2
      vols. in 8 vo. Traject. ad Rhenum. 3. Elementa Juris Civilis
      secundum Ordinem Institutionum, Lugd. Bat. 1751, in 8 vo. 4.
      Elementa J. C. secundum Ordinem Pandectarum Traject. 1772, in
      8vo. 2 vols. * Note: Our author, who was not a lawyer, was
      necessarily obliged to content himself with following the
      opinions of those writers who were then of the greatest
      authority; but as Heineccius, notwithstanding his high reputation
      for the study of the Roman law, knew nothing of the subject on
      which he treated, but what he had learned from the compilations
      of various authors, it happened that, in following the sometimes
      rash opinions of these guides, Gibbon has fallen into many
      errors, which we shall endeavor in succession to correct. The
      work of Bach on the History of the Roman Jurisprudence, with
      which Gibbon was not acquainted, is far superior to that of
      Heineccius and since that time we have new obligations to the
      modern historic civilians, whose indefatigable researches have
      greatly enlarged the sphere of our knowledge in this important
      branch of history. We want a pen like that of Gibbon to give to
      the more accurate notions which we have acquired since his time,
      the brilliancy, the vigor, and the animation which Gibbon has
      bestowed on the opinions of Heineccius and his contemporaries.—W]

      5 (return) [ Our original text is a fragment de Origine Juris
      (Pandect. l. i. tit. ii.) of Pomponius, a Roman lawyer, who lived
      under the Antonines, (Heinecc. tom. iii. syl. iii. p. 66—126.) It
      has been abridged, and probably corrupted, by Tribonian, and
      since restored by Bynkershoek (Opp. tom. i. p. 279—304.)]

      The primitive government of Rome 6 was composed, with some
      political skill, of an elective king, a council of nobles, and a
      general assembly of the people. War and religion were
      administered by the supreme magistrate; and he alone proposed the
      laws, which were debated in the senate, and finally ratified or
      rejected by a majority of votes in the thirty curiae or parishes
      of the city. Romulus, Numa, and Servius Tullius, are celebrated
      as the most ancient legislators; and each of them claims his
      peculiar part in the threefold division of jurisprudence. 7 The
      laws of marriage, the education of children, and the authority of
      parents, which may seem to draw their origin from nature itself,
      are ascribed to the untutored wisdom of Romulus. The law of
      nations and of religious worship, which Numa introduced, was
      derived from his nocturnal converse with the nymph Egeria. The
      civil law is attributed to the experience of Servius: he balanced
      the rights and fortunes of the seven classes of citizens; and
      guarded, by fifty new regulations, the observance of contracts
      and the punishment of crimes. The state, which he had inclined
      towards a democracy, was changed by the last Tarquin into a
      lawless despotism; and when the kingly office was abolished, the
      patricians engrossed the benefits of freedom. The royal laws
      became odious or obsolete; the mysterious deposit was silently
      preserved by the priests and nobles; and at the end of sixty
      years, the citizens of Rome still complained that they were ruled
      by the arbitrary sentence of the magistrates. Yet the positive
      institutions of the kings had blended themselves with the public
      and private manners of the city, some fragments of that venerable
      jurisprudence 8 were compiled by the diligence of antiquarians, 9
      and above twenty texts still speak the rudeness of the Pelasgic
      idiom of the Latins. 10

      6 (return) [ The constitutional history of the kings of Rome may
      be studied in the first book of Livy, and more copiously in
      Dionysius Halicarnassensis, (l. li. p. 80—96, 119—130, l. iv. p.
      198—220,) who sometimes betrays the character of a rhetorician
      and a Greek. * Note: M. Warnkonig refers to the work of Beaufort,
      on the Uncertainty of the Five First Ages of the Roman History,
      with which Gibbon was probably acquainted, to Niebuhr, and to the
      less known volume of Wachsmuth, “Aeltere Geschichte des Rom.
      Staats.” To these I would add A. W. Schlegel’s Review of Niebuhr,
      and my friend Dr. Arnold’s recently published volume, of which
      the chapter on the Law of the XII. Tables appears to me one of
      the most valuable, if not the most valuable, chapter.—M.]

      7 (return) [ This threefold division of the law was applied to
      the three Roman kings by Justus Lipsius, (Opp. tom. iv. p. 279;)
      is adopted by Gravina, (Origines Juris Civilis, p. 28, edit.
      Lips. 1737:) and is reluctantly admitted by Mascou, his German
      editor. * Note: Whoever is acquainted with the real notions of
      the Romans on the jus naturale, gentium et civile, cannot but
      disapprove of this explanation which has no relation to them, and
      might be taken for a pleasantry. It is certainly unnecessary to
      increase the confusion which already prevails among modern
      writers on the true sense of these ideas. Hugo.—W]

      8 (return) [ The most ancient Code or Digest was styled Jus
      Papirianum, from the first compiler, Papirius, who flourished
      somewhat before or after the Regifugium, (Pandect. l. i. tit.
      ii.) The best judicial critics, even Bynkershoek (tom. i. p. 284,
      285) and Heineccius, (Hist. J. C. R. l. i. c. 16, 17, and Opp.
      tom. iii. sylloge iv. p. 1—8,) give credit to this tale of
      Pomponius, without sufficiently adverting to the value and rarity
      of such a monument of the third century, of the illiterate city.
      I much suspect that the Caius Papirius, the Pontifex Maximus, who
      revived the laws of Numa (Dionys. Hal. l. iii. p. 171) left only
      an oral tradition; and that the Jus Papirianum of Granius Flaccus
      (Pandect. l. L. tit. xvi. leg. 144) was not a commentary, but an
      original work, compiled in the time of Caesar, (Censorin. de Die
      Natali, l. iii. p. 13, Duker de Latinitate J. C. p. 154.) Note:
      Niebuhr considers the Jus Papirianum, adduced by Verrius Fiaccus,
      to be of undoubted authenticity. Rom. Geschichte, l. 257.—M.
      Compare this with the work of M. Hugo.—W.]

      9 (return) [ A pompous, though feeble attempt to restore the
      original, is made in the Histoire de la Jurisprudence Romaine of
      Terasson, p. 22—72, Paris, 1750, in folio; a work of more promise
      than performance.]

      10 (return) [ In the year 1444, seven or eight tables of brass
      were dug up between Cortona and Gubio. A part of these (for the
      rest is Etruscan) represents the primitive state of the Pelasgic
      letters and language, which are ascribed by Herodotus to that
      district of Italy, (l. i. c. 56, 57, 58;) though this difficult
      passage may be explained of a Crestona in Thrace, (Notes de
      Larcher, tom. i. p. 256—261.) The savage dialect of the Eugubine
      tables has exercised, and may still elude, the divination of
      criticism; but the root is undoubtedly Latin, of the same age and
      character as the Saliare Carmen, which, in the time of Horace,
      none could understand. The Roman idiom, by an infusion of Doric
      and Aeolic Greek, was gradually ripened into the style of the
      xii. tables, of the Duillian column, of Ennius, of Terence, and
      of Cicero, (Gruter. Inscript. tom. i. p. cxlii. Scipion Maffei,
      Istoria Diplomatica, p. 241—258. Bibliotheque Italique, tom. iii.
      p. 30—41, 174—205. tom. xiv. p. 1—52.) * Note: The Eugubine
      Tables have exercised the ingenuity of the Italian and German
      critics; it seems admitted (O. Muller, die Etrusker, ii. 313)
      that they are Tuscan. See the works of Lanzi, Passeri, Dempster,
      and O. Muller.—M]

      I shall not repeat the well-known story of the Decemvirs, 11 who
      sullied by their actions the honor of inscribing on brass, or
      wood, or ivory, the Twelve Tables of the Roman laws. 12 They were
      dictated by the rigid and jealous spirit of an aristocracy, which
      had yielded with reluctance to the just demands of the people.
      But the substance of the Twelve Tables was adapted to the state
      of the city; and the Romans had emerged from Barbarism, since
      they were capable of studying and embracing the institutions of
      their more enlightened neighbors. 1211 A wise Ephesian was driven
      by envy from his native country: before he could reach the shores
      of Latium, he had observed the various forms of human nature and
      civil society: he imparted his knowledge to the legislators of
      Rome, and a statue was erected in the forum to the perpetual
      memory of Hermodorus. 13 The names and divisions of the copper
      money, the sole coin of the infant state, were of Dorian origin:
      14 the harvests of Campania and Sicily relieved the wants of a
      people whose agriculture was often interrupted by war and
      faction; and since the trade was established, 15 the deputies who
      sailed from the Tyber might return from the same harbors with a
      more precious cargo of political wisdom. The colonies of Great
      Greece had transported and improved the arts of their mother
      country. Cumae and Rhegium, Crotona and Tarentum, Agrigentum and
      Syracuse, were in the rank of the most flourishing cities. The
      disciples of Pythagoras applied philosophy to the use of
      government; the unwritten laws of Charondas accepted the aid of
      poetry and music, 16 and Zaleucus framed the republic of the
      Locrians, which stood without alteration above two hundred years.
      17 From a similar motive of national pride, both Livy and
      Dionysius are willing to believe, that the deputies of Rome
      visited Athens under the wise and splendid administration of
      Pericles; and the laws of Solon were transfused into the twelve
      tables. If such an embassy had indeed been received from the
      Barbarians of Hesperia, the Roman name would have been familiar
      to the Greeks before the reign of Alexander; 18 and the faintest
      evidence would have been explored and celebrated by the curiosity
      of succeeding times. But the Athenian monuments are silent; nor
      will it seem credible that the patricians should undertake a long
      and perilous navigation to copy the purest model of democracy. In
      the comparison of the tables of Solon with those of the
      Decemvirs, some casual resemblance may be found; some rules which
      nature and reason have revealed to every society; some proofs of
      a common descent from Egypt or Phoenicia. 19 But in all the great
      lines of public and private jurisprudence, the legislators of
      Rome and Athens appear to be strangers or adverse at each other.

      11 (return) [ Compare Livy (l. iii. c. 31—59) with Dionysius
      Halicarnassensis, (l. x. p. 644—xi. p. 691.) How concise and
      animated is the Roman—how prolix and lifeless the Greek! Yet he
      has admirably judged the masters, and defined the rules, of
      historical composition.]

      12 (return) [ From the historians, Heineccius (Hist. J. R. l. i.
      No. 26) maintains that the twelve tables were of brass—aereas; in
      the text of Pomponius we read eboreas; for which Scaliger has
      substituted roboreas, (Bynkershoek, p. 286.) Wood, brass, and
      ivory, might be successively employed. Note: Compare Niebuhr,
      vol. ii. p. 349, &c.—M.]

      1211 (return) [ Compare Niebuhr, 355, note 720.—M. It is a most
      important question whether the twelve tables in fact include laws
      imported from Greece. The negative opinion maintained by our
      author, is now almost universally adopted, particularly by Mm.
      Niebuhr, Hugo, and others. See my Institutiones Juris Romani
      privati Leodii, 1819, p. 311, 312.—W. Dr. Arnold, p. 255, seems
      to incline to the opposite opinion. Compare some just and
      sensible observations in the Appendix to Mr. Travers Twiss’s
      Epitome of Niebuhr, p. 347, Oxford, 1836.—M.]

      13 (return) [ His exile is mentioned by Cicero, (Tusculan.
      Quaestion. v. 36; his statue by Pliny, (Hist. Nat. xxxiv. 11.)
      The letter, dream, and prophecy of Heraclitus, are alike
      spurious, (Epistolae Graec. Divers. p. 337.) * Note: Compare
      Niebuhr, ii. 209.—M. See the Mem de l’Academ. des Inscript. xxii.
      p. 48. It would be difficult to disprove, that a certain
      Hermodorus had some share in framing the Laws of the Twelve
      Tables. Pomponius even says that this Hermodorus was the author
      of the last two tables. Pliny calls him the Interpreter of the
      Decemvirs, which may lead us to suppose that he labored with them
      in drawing up that law. But it is astonishing that in his
      Dissertation, (De Hermodoro vero XII. Tabularum Auctore, Annales
      Academiae Groninganae anni 1817, 1818,) M. Gratama has ventured
      to advance two propositions entirely devoid of proof: “Decem
      priores tabulas ab ipsis Romanis non esse profectas, tota
      confirma Decemviratus Historia,” et “Hermodorum legum
      decemviralium ceri nominis auctorem esse, qui eas composuerit
      suis ordinibus, disposuerit, suaque fecerit auctoritate, ut a
      decemviris reciperentur.” This truly was an age in which the
      Roman Patricians would allow their laws to be dictated by a
      foreign Exile! Mr. Gratama does not attempt to prove the
      authenticity of the supposititious letter of Heraclitus. He
      contents himself with expressing his astonishment that M. Bonamy
      (as well as Gibbon) will be receive it as genuine.—W.]

      14 (return) [ This intricate subject of the Sicilian and Roman
      money, is ably discussed by Dr. Bentley, (Dissertation on the
      Epistles of Phalaris, p. 427—479,) whose powers in this
      controversy were called forth by honor and resentment.]

      15 (return) [ The Romans, or their allies, sailed as far as the
      fair promontory of Africa, (Polyb. l. iii. p. 177, edit.
      Casaubon, in folio.) Their voyages to Cumae, &c., are noticed by
      Livy and Dionysius.]

      16 (return) [ This circumstance would alone prove the antiquity
      of Charondas, the legislator of Rhegium and Catana, who, by a
      strange error of Diodorus Siculus (tom. i. l. xii. p. 485—492) is
      celebrated long afterwards as the author of the policy of
      Thurium.]

      17 (return) [ Zaleucus, whose existence has been rashly attacked,
      had the merit and glory of converting a band of outlaws (the
      Locrians) into the most virtuous and orderly of the Greek
      republics. (See two Memoirs of the Baron de St. Croix, sur la
      Legislation de la Grande Grece Mem. de l’Academie, tom. xlii. p.
      276—333.) But the laws of Zaleucus and Charondas, which imposed
      on Diodorus and Stobaeus, are the spurious composition of a
      Pythagorean sophist, whose fraud has been detected by the
      critical sagacity of Bentley, p. 335—377.]

      18 (return) [ I seize the opportunity of tracing the progress of
      this national intercourse 1. Herodotus and Thucydides (A. U. C.
      300—350) appear ignorant of the name and existence of Rome,
      (Joseph. contra Appion tom. ii. l. i. c. 12, p. 444, edit.
      Havercamp.) 2. Theopompus (A. U. C. 400, Plin. iii. 9) mentions
      the invasion of the Gauls, which is noticed in looser terms by
      Heraclides Ponticus, (Plutarch in Camillo, p. 292, edit. H.
      Stephan.) 3. The real or fabulous embassy of the Romans to
      Alexander (A. U. C. 430) is attested by Clitarchus, (Plin. iii.
      9,) by Aristus and Asclepiades, (Arrian. l. vii. p. 294, 295,)
      and by Memnon of Heraclea, (apud Photium, cod. ccxxiv. p. 725,)
      though tacitly denied by Livy. 4. Theophrastus (A. U. C. 440)

      Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence.—Part II.

      Whatever might be the origin or the merit of the twelve tables,
      20 they obtained among the Romans that blind and partial
      reverence which the lawyers of every country delight to bestow on
      their municipal institutions. The study is recommended by Cicero
      21 as equally pleasant and instructive. “They amuse the mind by
      the remembrance of old words and the portrait of ancient manners;
      they inculcate the soundest principles of government and morals;
      and I am not afraid to affirm, that the brief composition of the
      Decemvirs surpasses in genuine value the libraries of Grecian
      philosophy. How admirable,” says Tully, with honest or affected
      prejudice, “is the wisdom of our ancestors! We alone are the
      masters of civil prudence, and our superiority is the more
      conspicuous, if we deign to cast our eyes on the rude and almost
      ridiculous jurisprudence of Draco, of Solon, and of Lycurgus.”
      The twelve tables were committed to the memory of the young and
      the meditation of the old; they were transcribed and illustrated
      with learned diligence; they had escaped the flames of the Gauls,
      they subsisted in the age of Justinian, and their subsequent loss
      has been imperfectly restored by the labors of modern critics. 22
      But although these venerable monuments were considered as the
      rule of right and the fountain of justice, 23 they were
      overwhelmed by the weight and variety of new laws, which, at the
      end of five centuries, became a grievance more intolerable than
      the vices of the city. 24 Three thousand brass plates, the acts
      of the senate of the people, were deposited in the Capitol: 25
      and some of the acts, as the Julian law against extortion,
      surpassed the number of a hundred chapters. 26 The Decemvirs had
      neglected to import the sanction of Zaleucus, which so long
      maintained the integrity of his republic. A Locrian, who proposed
      any new law, stood forth in the assembly of the people with a
      cord round his neck, and if the law was rejected, the innovator
      was instantly strangled.

      The Decemvirs had been named, and their tables were approved, by
      an assembly of the centuries, in which riches preponderated
      against numbers. To the first class of Romans, the proprietors of
      one hundred thousand pounds of copper, 27 ninety-eight votes were
      assigned, and only ninety-five were left for the six inferior
      classes, distributed according to their substance by the artful
      policy of Servius. But the tribunes soon established a more
      specious and popular maxim, that every citizen has an equal right
      to enact the laws which he is bound to obey. Instead of the
      centuries, they convened the tribes; and the patricians, after an
      impotent struggle, submitted to the decrees of an assembly, in
      which their votes were confounded with those of the meanest
      plebeians. Yet as long as the tribes successively passed over
      narrow bridges 28 and gave their voices aloud, the conduct of
      each citizen was exposed to the eyes and ears of his friends and
      countrymen. The insolvent debtor consulted the wishes of his
      creditor; the client would have blushed to oppose the views of
      his patron; the general was followed by his veterans, and the
      aspect of a grave magistrate was a living lesson to the
      multitude. A new method of secret ballot abolished the influence
      of fear and shame, of honor and interest, and the abuse of
      freedom accelerated the progress of anarchy and despotism. 29 The
      Romans had aspired to be equal; they were levelled by the
      equality of servitude; and the dictates of Augustus were
      patiently ratified by the formal consent of the tribes or
      centuries. Once, and once only, he experienced a sincere and
      strenuous opposition. His subjects had resigned all political
      liberty; they defended the freedom of domestic life. A law which
      enforced the obligation, and strengthened the bonds of marriage,
      was clamorously rejected; Propertius, in the arms of Delia,
      applauded the victory of licentious love; and the project of
      reform was suspended till a new and more tractable generation had
      arisen in the world. 30 Such an example was not necessary to
      instruct a prudent usurper of the mischief of popular assemblies;
      and their abolition, which Augustus had silently prepared, was
      accomplished without resistance, and almost without notice, on
      the accession of his successor. 31 Sixty thousand plebeian
      legislators, whom numbers made formidable, and poverty secure,
      were supplanted by six hundred senators, who held their honors,
      their fortunes, and their lives, by the clemency of the emperor.
      The loss of executive power was alleviated by the gift of
      legislative authority; and Ulpian might assert, after the
      practice of two hundred years, that the decrees of the senate
      obtained the force and validity of laws. In the times of freedom,
      the resolves of the people had often been dictated by the passion
      or error of the moment: the Cornelian, Pompeian, and Julian laws
      were adapted by a single hand to the prevailing disorders; but
      the senate, under the reign of the Caesars, was composed of
      magistrates and lawyers, and in questions of private
      jurisprudence, the integrity of their judgment was seldom
      perverted by fear or interest. 32

      300 pounds sterling. But their calculation can apply only to the
      latter times, when the as was diminished to 1-24th of its ancient
      weight: nor can I believe that in the first ages, however
      destitute of the precious metals, a single ounce of silver could
      have been exchanged for seventy pounds of copper or brass. A more
      simple and rational method is to value the copper itself
      according to the present rate, and, after comparing the mint and
      the market price, the Roman and avoirdupois weight, the primitive
      as or Roman pound of copper may be appreciated at one English
      shilling, and the 100,000 asses of the first class amounted to
      5000 pounds sterling. It will appear from the same reckoning,
      that an ox was sold at Rome for five pounds, a sheep for ten
      shillings, and a quarter of wheat for one pound ten shillings,

      nevertheless participated in it under the Republic, since
      senatus-consulta relating to civil rights have been preserved,
      which are much earlier than the reigns of Augustus or Tiberius.
      It is true that, under the emperors, the senate exercised this
      right more frequently, and that the assemblies of the people had
      become much more rare, though in law they were still permitted,
      in the time of Ulpian. (See the fragments of Ulpian.) Bach has
      clearly demonstrated that the senate had the same power in the
      time of the Republic. It is natural that the senatus-consulta
      should have been more frequent under the emperors, because they
      employed those means of flattering the pride of the senators, by
      granting them the right of deliberating on all affairs which did
      not intrench on the Imperial power. Compare the discussions of M.
      Hugo, vol. i. p. 284, et seq.—W.]

      The silence or ambiguity of the laws was supplied by the
      occasional edicts 3211 of those magistrates who were invested
      with the honors of the state. 33 This ancient prerogative of the
      Roman kings was transferred, in their respective offices, to the
      consuls and dictators, the censors and praetors; and a similar
      right was assumed by the tribunes of the people, the ediles, and
      the proconsuls. At Rome, and in the provinces, the duties of the
      subject, and the intentions of the governor, were proclaimed; and
      the civil jurisprudence was reformed by the annual edicts of the
      supreme judge, the praetor of the city. 3311 As soon as he
      ascended his tribunal, he announced by the voice of the crier,
      and afterwards inscribed on a white wall, the rules which he
      proposed to follow in the decision of doubtful cases, and the
      relief which his equity would afford from the precise rigor of
      ancient statutes. A principle of discretion more congenial to
      monarchy was introduced into the republic: the art of respecting
      the name, and eluding the efficacy, of the laws, was improved by
      successive praetors; subtleties and fictions were invented to
      defeat the plainest meaning of the Decemvirs, and where the end
      was salutary, the means were frequently absurd. The secret or
      probable wish of the dead was suffered to prevail over the order
      of succession and the forms of testaments; and the claimant, who
      was excluded from the character of heir, accepted with equal
      pleasure from an indulgent praetor the possession of the goods of
      his late kinsman or benefactor. In the redress of private wrongs,
      compensations and fines were substituted to the obsolete rigor of
      the Twelve Tables; time and space were annihilated by fanciful
      suppositions; and the plea of youth, or fraud, or violence,
      annulled the obligation, or excused the performance, of an
      inconvenient contract. A jurisdiction thus vague and arbitrary
      was exposed to the most dangerous abuse: the substance, as well
      as the form, of justice were often sacrificed to the prejudices
      of virtue, the bias of laudable affection, and the grosser
      seductions of interest or resentment. But the errors or vices of
      each praetor expired with his annual office; such maxims alone as
      had been approved by reason and practice were copied by
      succeeding judges; the rule of proceeding was defined by the
      solution of new cases; and the temptations of injustice were
      removed by the Cornelian law, which compelled the praetor of the
      year to adhere to the spirit and letter of his first
      proclamation. 34 It was reserved for the curiosity and learning
      of Adrian, to accomplish the design which had been conceived by
      the genius of Caesar; and the praetorship of Salvius Julian, an
      eminent lawyer, was immortalized by the composition of the
      Perpetual Edict. This well-digested code was ratified by the
      emperor and the senate; the long divorce of law and equity was at
      length reconciled; and, instead of the Twelve Tables, the
      perpetual edict was fixed as the invariable standard of civil
      jurisprudence. 35

      the emperor what the master of the horse was to the dictator
      under the Republic. He was the delegate, therefore, of the full
      Imperial authority; and no appeal could be made or exception
      taken against his edicts. I had not observed this passage, when

      33 (return) [ The jus honorarium of the praetors and other
      magistrates is strictly defined in the Latin text to the
      Institutes, (l. i. tit. ii. No. 7,) and more loosely explained in
      the Greek paraphrase of Theophilus, (p. 33—38, edit. Reitz,) who
      drops the important word honorarium. * Note: The author here
      follows the opinion of Heineccius, who, according to the idea of
      his master Thomasius, was unwilling to suppose that magistrates
      exercising a judicial could share in the legislative power. For
      this reason he represents the edicts of the praetors as absurd.
      (See his work, Historia Juris Romani, 69, 74.) But Heineccius had
      altogether a false notion of this important institution of the
      Romans, to which we owe in a great degree the perfection of their
      jurisprudence. Heineccius, therefore, in his own days had many
      opponents of his system, among others the celebrated Ritter,
      professor at Wittemberg, who contested it in notes appended to
      the work of Heineccius, and retained in all subsequent editions
      of that book. After Ritter, the learned Bach undertook to
      vindicate the edicts of the praetors in his Historia Jurisprud.
      Rom. edit. 6, p. 218, 224. But it remained for a civilian of our
      own days to throw light on the spirit and true character of this
      institution. M. Hugo has completely demonstrated that the
      praetorian edicts furnished the salutary means of perpetually
      harmonizing the legislation with the spirit of the times. The
      praetors were the true organs of public opinion. It was not
      according to their caprice that they framed their regulations,
      but according to the manners and to the opinions of the great
      civil lawyers of their day. We know from Cicero himself, that it
      was esteemed a great honor among the Romans to publish an edict,
      well conceived and well drawn. The most distinguished lawyers of
      Rome were invited by the praetor to assist in framing this annual
      law, which, according to its principle, was only a declaration
      which the praetor made to the public, to announce the manner in
      which he would judge, and to guard against every charge of
      partiality. Those who had reason to fear his opinions might delay
      their cause till the following year. The praetor was responsible
      for all the faults which he committed. The tribunes could lodge
      an accusation against the praetor who issued a partial edict. He
      was bound strictly to follow and to observe the regulations
      published by him at the commencement of his year of office,
      according to the Cornelian law, by which these edicts were called
      perpetual, and he could make no change in a regulation once
      published. The praetor was obliged to submit to his own edict,
      and to judge his own affairs according to its provisions. These
      magistrates had no power of departing from the fundamental laws,
      or the laws of the Twelve Tables. The people held them in such
      consideration, that they rarely enacted laws contrary to their
      provisions; but as some provisions were found inefficient, others
      opposed to the manners of the people, and to the spirit of
      subsequent ages, the praetors, still maintaining respect for the
      laws, endeavored to bring them into accordance with the
      necessities of the existing time, by such fictions as best suited
      the nature of the case. In what legislation do we not find these
      fictions, which even yet exist, absurd and ridiculous as they
      are, among the ancient laws of modern nations? These always
      variable edicts at length comprehended the whole of the Roman
      legislature, and became the subject of the commentaries of the
      most celebrated lawyers. They must therefore be considered as the
      basis of all the Roman jurisprudence comprehended in the Digest
      of Justinian. ——It is in this sense that M. Schrader has written
      on this important institution, proposing it for imitation as far
      as may be consistent with our manners, and agreeable to our
      political institutions, in order to avoid immature legislation
      becoming a permanent evil. See the History of the Roman Law by M.
      Hugo, vol. i. p. 296, &c., vol. ii. p. 30, et seq., 78. et seq.,
      and the note in my elementary book on the Industries, p. 313.
      With regard to the works best suited to give information on the
      framing and the form of these edicts, see Haubold, Institutiones
      Literariae, tom. i. p. 321, 368. All that Heineccius says about
      the usurpation of the right of making these edicts by the
      praetors is false, and contrary to all historical testimony. A
      multitude of authorities proves that the magistrates were under
      an obligation to publish these edicts.—W. ——With the utmost
      deference for these excellent civilians, I cannot but consider
      this confusion of the judicial and legislative authority as a
      very perilous constitutional precedent. It might answer among a
      people so singularly trained as the Romans were by habit and
      national character in reverence for legal institutions, so as to
      be an aristocracy, if not a people, of legislators; but in most
      nations the investiture of a magistrate in such authority,
      leaving to his sole judgment the lawyers he might consult, and
      the view of public opinion which he might take, would be a very
      insufficient guaranty for right legislation.—M.]

      the commencement of a work found among the papers of Heineccius,
      and published after his death.—G. ——Note: Gibbon has here fallen
      into an error, with Heineccius, and almost the whole literary
      world, concerning the real meaning of what is called the
      perpetual edict of Hadrian. Since the Cornelian law, the edicts
      were perpetual, but only in this sense, that the praetor could
      not change them during the year of his magistracy. And although
      it appears that under Hadrian, the civilian Julianus made, or
      assisted in making, a complete collection of the edicts, (which
      certainly had been done likewise before Hadrian, for example, by
      Ofilius, qui diligenter edictum composuit,) we have no sufficient
      proof to admit the common opinion, that the Praetorian edict was
      declared perpetually unalterable by Hadrian. The writers on law
      subsequent to Hadrian (and among the rest Pomponius, in his
      Summary of the Roman Jurisprudence) speak of the edict as it
      existed in the time of Cicero. They would not certainly have
      passed over in silence so remarkable a change in the most
      important source of the civil law. M. Hugo has conclusively shown
      that the various passages in authors, like Eutropius, are not
      sufficient to establish the opinion introduced by Heineccius.
      Compare Hugo, vol. ii. p. 78. A new proof of this is found in the
      Institutes of Gaius, who, in the first books of his work,
      expresses himself in the same manner, without mentioning any
      change made by Hadrian. Nevertheless, if it had taken place, he
      must have noticed it, as he does l. i. 8, the responsa prudentum,
      on the occasion of a rescript of Hadrian. There is no lacuna in
      the text. Why then should Gaius maintain silence concerning an
      innovation so much more important than that of which he speaks?
      After all, this question becomes of slight interest, since, in
      fact, we find no change in the perpetual edict inserted in the
      Digest, from the time of Hadrian to the end of that epoch, except
      that made by Julian, (compare Hugo, l. c.) The latter lawyers
      appear to follow, in their commentaries, the same texts as their
      predecessors. It is natural to suppose, that, after the labors of
      so many men distinguished in jurisprudence, the framing of the
      edict must have attained such perfection that it would have been
      difficult to have made any innovation. We nowhere find that the
      jurists of the Pandects disputed concerning the words, or the
      drawing up of the edict. What difference would, in fact, result
      from this with regard to our codes, and our modern legislation?
      Compare the learned Dissertation of M. Biener, De Salvii Juliani
      meritis in Edictum Praetorium recte aestimandis. Lipsae, 1809,
      4to.—W.]

      From Augustus to Trajan, the modest Caesars were content to
      promulgate their edicts in the various characters of a Roman
      magistrate; 3511 and, in the decrees of the senate, the epistles
      and orations of the prince were respectfully inserted. Adrian 36
      appears to have been the first who assumed, without disguise, the
      plenitude of legislative power. And this innovation, so agreeable
      to his active mind, was countenanced by the patience of the
      times, and his long absence from the seat of government. The same
      policy was embraced by succeeding monarchs, and, according to the
      harsh metaphor of Tertullian, “the gloomy and intricate forest of
      ancient laws was cleared away by the axe of royal mandates and
      constitutions.” 37 During four centuries, from Adrian to
      Justinian the public and private jurisprudence was moulded by the
      will of the sovereign; and few institutions, either human or
      divine, were permitted to stand on their former basis. The origin
      of Imperial legislation was concealed by the darkness of ages and
      the terrors of armed despotism; and a double tiction was
      propagated by the servility, or perhaps the ignorance, of the
      civilians, who basked in the sunshine of the Roman and Byzantine
      courts. 1. To the prayer of the ancient Caesars, the people or
      the senate had sometimes granted a personal exemption from the
      obligation and penalty of particular statutes; and each
      indulgence was an act of jurisdiction exercised by the republic
      over the first of her citizens. His humble privilege was at
      length transformed into the prerogative of a tyrant; and the
      Latin expression of “released from the laws” 38 was supposed to
      exalt the emperor above all human restraints, and to leave his
      conscience and reason as the sacred measure of his conduct. 2. A
      similar dependence was implied in the decrees of the senate,
      which, in every reign, defined the titles and powers of an
      elective magistrate. But it was not before the ideas, and even
      the language, of the Romans had been corrupted, that a royal law,
      39 and an irrevocable gift of the people, were created by the
      fancy of Ulpian, or more probably of Tribonian himself; 40 and
      the origin of Imperial power, though false in fact, and slavish
      in its consequence, was supported on a principle of freedom and
      justice. “The pleasure of the emperor has the vigor and effect of
      law, since the Roman people, by the royal law, have transferred
      to their prince the full extent of their own power and
      sovereignty.” 41 The will of a single man, of a child perhaps,
      was allowed to prevail over the wisdom of ages and the
      inclinations of millions; and the degenerate Greeks were proud to
      declare, that in his hands alone the arbitrary exercise of
      legislation could be safely deposited. “What interest or
      passion,” exclaims Theophilus in the court of Justinian, “can
      reach the calm and sublime elevation of the monarch? He is
      already master of the lives and fortunes of his subjects; and
      those who have incurred his displeasure are already numbered with
      the dead.” 42 Disdaining the language of flattery, the historian
      may confess, that in questions of private jurisprudence, the
      absolute sovereign of a great empire can seldom be influenced by
      any personal considerations. Virtue, or even reason, will suggest
      to his impartial mind, that he is the guardian of peace and
      equity, and that the interest of society is inseparably connected
      with his own. Under the weakest and most vicious reign, the seat
      of justice was filled by the wisdom and integrity of Papinian and
      Ulpian; 43 and the purest materials of the Code and Pandects are
      inscribed with the names of Caracalla and his ministers. 44 The
      tyrant of Rome was sometimes the benefactor of the provinces. A
      dagger terminated the crimes of Domitian; but the prudence of
      Nerva confirmed his acts, which, in the joy of their deliverance,
      had been rescinded by an indignant senate. 45 Yet in the
      rescripts, 46 replies to the consultations of the magistrates,
      the wisest of princes might be deceived by a partial exposition
      of the case. And this abuse, which placed their hasty decisions
      on the same level with mature and deliberate acts of legislation,
      was ineffectually condemned by the sense and example of Trajan.
      The rescripts of the emperor, his grants and decrees, his edicts
      and pragmatic sanctions, were subscribed in purple ink, 47 and
      transmitted to the provinces as general or special laws, which
      the magistrates were bound to execute, and the people to obey.
      But as their number continually multiplied, the rule of obedience
      became each day more doubtful and obscure, till the will of the
      sovereign was fixed and ascertained in the Gregorian, the
      Hermogenian, and the Theodosian codes. 4711 The two first, of
      which some fragments have escaped, were framed by two private
      lawyers, to preserve the constitutions of the Pagan emperors from
      Adrian to Constantine. The third, which is still extant, was
      digested in sixteen books by the order of the younger Theodosius
      to consecrate the laws of the Christian princes from Constantine
      to his own reign. But the three codes obtained an equal authority
      in the tribunals; and any act which was not included in the
      sacred deposit might be disregarded by the judge as epurious or
      obsolete. 48

      emperors were invested with this legislative power. The newly

      uncertain whether this was a general law, passed on the
      transition of the government from a republican to a monarchical

      Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence.—Part III.

      Among savage nations, the want of letters is imperfectly supplied
      by the use of visible signs, which awaken attention, and
      perpetuate the remembrance of any public or private transaction.
      The jurisprudence of the first Romans exhibited the scenes of a
      pantomime; the words were adapted to the gestures, and the
      slightest error or neglect in the forms of proceeding was
      sufficient to annul the substance of the fairest claim. The
      communion of the marriage-life was denoted by the necessary
      elements of fire and water; 49 and the divorced wife resigned the
      bunch of keys, by the delivery of which she had been invested
      with the government of the family. The manumission of a son, or a
      slave, was performed by turning him round with a gentle blow on
      the cheek; a work was prohibited by the casting of a stone;
      prescription was interrupted by the breaking of a branch; the
      clinched fist was the symbol of a pledge or deposit; the right
      hand was the gift of faith and confidence. The indenture of
      covenants was a broken straw; weights and scales were introduced
      into every payment, and the heir who accepted a testament was
      sometimes obliged to snap his fingers, to cast away his garments,
      and to leap or dance with real or affected transport. 50 If a
      citizen pursued any stolen goods into a neighbor’s house, he
      concealed his nakedness with a linen towel, and hid his face with
      a mask or basin, lest he should encounter the eyes of a virgin or
      a matron. 51 In a civil action the plaintiff touched the ear of
      his witness, seized his reluctant adversary by the neck, and
      implored, in solemn lamentation, the aid of his fellow-citizens.
      The two competitors grasped each other’s hand as if they stood
      prepared for combat before the tribunal of the praetor; he
      commanded them to produce the object of the dispute; they went,
      they returned with measured steps, and a clod of earth was cast
      at his feet to represent the field for which they contended. This
      occult science of the words and actions of law was the
      inheritance of the pontiffs and patricians. Like the Chaldean
      astrologers, they announced to their clients the days of business
      and repose; these important trifles were interwoven with the
      religion of Numa; and after the publication of the Twelve Tables,
      the Roman people was still enslaved by the ignorance of judicial
      proceedings. The treachery of some plebeian officers at length
      revealed the profitable mystery: in a more enlightened age, the
      legal actions were derided and observed; and the same antiquity
      which sanctified the practice, obliterated the use and meaning of
      this primitive language. 52

      49 (return) [ Scaevola, most probably Q. Cervidius Scaevola; the
      master of Papinian considers this acceptance of fire and water as
      the essence of marriage, (Pandect. l. xxiv. tit. 1, leg. 66. See
      Heineccius, Hist. J. R. No. 317.)]

      50 (return) [ Cicero (de Officiis, iii. 19) may state an ideal
      case, but St. Am brose (de Officiis, iii. 2,) appeals to the
      practice of his own times, which he understood as a lawyer and a
      magistrate, (Schulting ad Ulpian, Fragment. tit. xxii. No. 28, p.
      643, 644.) * Note: In this passage the author has endeavored to
      collect all the examples of judicial formularies which he could
      find. That which he adduces as the form of cretio haereditatis is
      absolutely false. It is sufficient to glance at the passage in
      Cicero which he cites, to see that it has no relation to it. The
      author appeals to the opinion of Schulting, who, in the passage
      quoted, himself protests against the ridiculous and absurd
      interpretation of the passage in Cicero, and observes that
      Graevius had already well explained the real sense. See in Gaius
      the form of cretio haereditatis Inst. l. ii. p. 166.—W.]

      51 (return) [ The furtum lance licioque conceptum was no longer
      understood in the time of the Antonines, (Aulus Gellius, xvi.
      10.) The Attic derivation of Heineccius, (Antiquitat. Rom. l. iv.
      tit. i. No. 13—21) is supported by the evidence of Aristophanes,
      his scholiast, and Pollux. * Note: Nothing more is known of this
      ceremony; nevertheless we find that already in his own days Gaius
      turned it into ridicule. He says, (lib. iii. et p. 192, Sections
      293,) prohibiti actio quadrupli ex edicto praetoris introducta
      est; lex autem eo nomine nullam poenam constituit. Hoc solum
      praecepit, ut qui quaerere velit, nudus quaerat, linteo cinctus,
      lancem habens; qui si quid invenerit. jubet id lex furtum
      manifestum esse. Quid sit autem linteum? quaesitum est. Sed
      verius est consuti genus esse, quo necessariae partes tegerentur.
      Quare lex tota ridicula est. Nam qui vestitum quaerere prohibet,
      is et nudum quaerere prohibiturus est; eo magis, quod invenerit
      ibi imponat, neutrum eorum procedit, si id quod quaeratur, ejus
      magnitudinis aut naturae sit ut neque subjici, neque ibi imponi
      possit. Certe non dubitatur, cujuscunque materiae sit ea lanx,
      satis legi fieri. We see moreover, from this passage, that the
      basin, as most authors, resting on the authority of Festus, have
      supposed, was not used to cover the figure.—W. Gibbon says the
      face, though equally inaccurately. This passage of Gaius, I must
      observe, as well as others in M. Warnkonig’s work, is very
      inaccurately printed.—M.]

      52 (return) [ In his Oration for Murena, (c. 9—13,) Cicero turns
      into ridicule the forms and mysteries of the civilians, which are
      represented with more candor by Aulus Gellius, (Noct. Attic. xx.
      10,) Gravina, (Opp p. 265, 266, 267,) and Heineccius,
      (Antiquitat. l. iv. tit. vi.) * Note: Gibbon had conceived
      opinions too decided against the forms of procedure in use among
      the Romans. Yet it is on these solemn forms that the certainty of
      laws has been founded among all nations. Those of the Romans were
      very intimately allied with the ancient religion, and must of
      necessity have disappeared as Rome attained a higher degree of
      civilization. Have not modern nations, even the most civilized,
      overloaded their laws with a thousand forms, often absurd, almost
      always trivial? How many examples are afforded by the English
      law! See, on the nature of these forms, the work of M. de Savigny
      on the Vocation of our Age for Legislation and Jurisprudence,
      Heidelberg, 1814, p. 9, 10.—W. This work of M. Savigny has been
      translated into English by Mr. Hayward.—M.]

      A more liberal art was cultivated, however, by the sage of Rome,
      who, in a stricter sense, may be considered as the authors of the
      civil law. The alteration of the idiom and manners of the Romans
      rendered the style of the Twelve Tables less familiar to each
      rising generation, and the doubtful passages were imperfectly
      explained by the study of legal antiquarians. To define the
      ambiguities, to circumscribe the latitude, to apply the
      principles, to extend the consequences, to reconcile the real or
      apparent contradictions, was a much nobler and more important
      task; and the province of legislation was silently invaded by the
      expounders of ancient statutes. Their subtle interpretations
      concurred with the equity of the praetor, to reform the tyranny
      of the darker ages: however strange or intricate the means, it
      was the aim of artificial jurisprudence to restore the simple
      dictates of nature and reason, and the skill of private citizens
      was usefully employed to undermine the public institutions of
      their country. 521 The revolution of almost one thousand years,
      from the Twelve Tables to the reign of Justinian, may be divided
      into three periods, almost equal in duration, and distinguished
      from each other by the mode of instruction and the character of
      the civilians. 53 Pride and ignorance contributed, during the
      first period, to confine within narrow limits the science of the
      Roman law. On the public days of market or assembly, the masters
      of the art were seen walking in the forum ready to impart the
      needful advice to the meanest of their fellow-citizens, from
      whose votes, on a future occasion, they might solicit a grateful
      return. As their years and honors increased, they seated
      themselves at home on a chair or throne, to expect with patient
      gravity the visits of their clients, who at the dawn of day, from
      the town and country, began to thunder at their door. The duties
      of social life, and the incidents of judicial proceeding, were
      the ordinary subject of these consultations, and the verbal or
      written opinion of the juris-consults was framed according to the
      rules of prudence and law. The youths of their own order and
      family were permitted to listen; their children enjoyed the
      benefit of more private lessons, and the Mucian race was long
      renowned for the hereditary knowledge of the civil law. The
      second period, the learned and splendid age of jurisprudence, may
      be extended from the birth of Cicero to the reign of Severus
      Alexander. A system was formed, schools were instituted, books
      were composed, and both the living and the dead became
      subservient to the instruction of the student. The tripartite of
      Aelius Paetus, surnamed Catus, or the Cunning, was preserved as
      the oldest work of Jurisprudence. Cato the censor derived some
      additional fame from his legal studies, and those of his son: the
      kindred appellation of Mucius Scaevola was illustrated by three
      sages of the law; but the perfection of the science was ascribed
      to Servius Sulpicius, their disciple, and the friend of Tully;
      and the long succession, which shone with equal lustre under the
      republic and under the Caesars, is finally closed by the
      respectable characters of Papinian, of Paul, and of Ulpian. Their
      names, and the various titles of their productions, have been
      minutely preserved, and the example of Labeo may suggest some
      idea of their diligence and fecundity. That eminent lawyer of the
      Augustan age divided the year between the city and country,
      between business and composition; and four hundred books are
      enumerated as the fruit of his retirement. Of the collection of
      his rival Capito, the two hundred and fifty-ninth book is
      expressly quoted; and few teachers could deliver their opinions
      in less than a century of volumes. In the third period, between
      the reigns of Alexander and Justinian, the oracles of
      jurisprudence were almost mute. The measure of curiosity had been
      filled: the throne was occupied by tyrants and Barbarians, the
      active spirits were diverted by religious disputes, and the
      professors of Rome, Constantinople, and Berytus, were humbly
      content to repeat the lessons of their more enlightened
      predecessors. From the slow advances and rapid decay of these
      legal studies, it may be inferred, that they require a state of
      peace and refinement. From the multitude of voluminous civilians
      who fill the intermediate space, it is evident that such studies
      may be pursued, and such works may be performed, with a common
      share of judgment, experience, and industry. The genius of Cicero
      and Virgil was more sensibly felt, as each revolving age had been
      found incapable of producing a similar or a second: but the most
      eminent teachers of the law were assured of leaving disciples
      equal or superior to themselves in merit and reputation.

      Roman jurisprudence into epochs, that Gibbon displays his
      profound knowledge of the laws of this people. M. Hugo, adopting
      this division, prefaced these three periods with the history of
      the times anterior to the Law of the Twelve Tables, which are, as
      it were, the infancy of the Roman law.—W]

      The jurisprudence which had been grossly adapted to the wants of
      the first Romans, was polished and improved in the seventh
      century of the city, by the alliance of Grecian philosophy. The
      Scaevolas had been taught by use and experience; but Servius
      Sulpicius 5311 was the first civilian who established his art on
      a certain and general theory. 54 For the discernment of truth and
      falsehood he applied, as an infallible rule, the logic of
      Aristotle and the stoics, reduced particular cases to general
      principles, and diffused over the shapeless mass the light of
      order and eloquence. Cicero, his contemporary and friend,
      declined the reputation of a professed lawyer; but the
      jurisprudence of his country was adorned by his incomparable
      genius, which converts into gold every object that it touches.
      After the example of Plato, he composed a republic; and, for the
      use of his republic, a treatise of laws; in which he labors to
      deduce from a celestial origin the wisdom and justice of the
      Roman constitution. The whole universe, according to his sublime
      hypothesis, forms one immense commonwealth: gods and men, who
      participate of the same essence, are members of the same
      community; reason prescribes the law of nature and nations; and
      all positive institutions, however modified by accident or
      custom, are drawn from the rule of right, which the Deity has
      inscribed on every virtuous mind. From these philosophical
      mysteries, he mildly excludes the sceptics who refuse to believe,
      and the epicureans who are unwilling to act. The latter disdain
      the care of the republic: he advises them to slumber in their
      shady gardens. But he humbly entreats that the new academy would
      be silent, since her bold objections would too soon destroy the
      fair and well ordered structure of his lofty system. 55 Plato,
      Aristotle, and Zeno, he represents as the only teachers who arm
      and instruct a citizen for the duties of social life. Of these,
      the armor of the stoics 56 was found to be of the firmest temper;
      and it was chiefly worn, both for use and ornament, in the
      schools of jurisprudence. From the portico, the Roman civilians
      learned to live, to reason, and to die: but they imbibed in some
      degree the prejudices of the sect; the love of paradox, the
      pertinacious habits of dispute, and a minute attachment to words
      and verbal distinctions. The superiority of form to matter was
      introduced to ascertain the right of property: and the equality
      of crimes is countenanced by an opinion of Trebatius, 57 that he
      who touches the ear, touches the whole body; and that he who
      steals from a heap of corn, or a hogshead of wine, is guilty of
      the entire theft. 58

      misunderstood this phrase of Cicero. It was only since his time
      that the real meaning of the author was apprehended. Cicero, in
      enumerating the qualifications of Trebatius, says, Accedit etiam,
      quod familiam ducit in jure civili, singularis memoria, summa

      most important qualification for a student of civil law, a
      remarkable memory, &c. This explanation, already conjectured by
      G. Menage, Amaenit. Juris Civilis, c. 14, is found in the
      dictionary of Scheller, v. Familia, and in the History of the
      Roman Law by M. Hugo. Many authors have asserted, without any

      the school of Epicurus—W.]

      Arms, eloquence, and the study of the civil law, promoted a
      citizen to the honors of the Roman state; and the three
      professions were sometimes more conspicuous by their union in the
      same character. In the composition of the edict, a learned
      praetor gave a sanction and preference to his private sentiments;
      the opinion of a censor, or a counsel, was entertained with
      respect; and a doubtful interpretation of the laws might be
      supported by the virtues or triumphs of the civilian. The
      patrician arts were long protected by the veil of mystery; and in
      more enlightened times, the freedom of inquiry established the
      general principles of jurisprudence. Subtile and intricate cases
      were elucidated by the disputes of the forum: rules, axioms, and
      definitions, 59 were admitted as the genuine dictates of reason;
      and the consent of the legal professors was interwoven into the
      practice of the tribunals. But these interpreters could neither
      enact nor execute the laws of the republic; and the judges might
      disregard the authority of the Scaevolas themselves, which was
      often overthrown by the eloquence or sophistry of an ingenious
      pleader. 60 Augustus and Tiberius were the first to adopt, as a
      useful engine, the science of the civilians; and their servile
      labors accommodated the old system to the spirit and views of
      despotism. Under the fair pretence of securing the dignity of the
      art, the privilege of subscribing legal and valid opinions was
      confined to the sages of senatorian or equestrian rank, who had
      been previously approved by the judgment of the prince; and this
      monopoly prevailed, till Adrian restored the freedom of the
      profession to every citizen conscious of his abilities and
      knowledge. The discretion of the praetor was now governed by the
      lessons of his teachers; the judges were enjoined to obey the
      comment as well as the text of the law; and the use of codicils
      was a memorable innovation, which Augustus ratified by the advice
      of the civilians. 61 6111

      (p. 41—45.) Yet the monopoly of Augustus, a harsh measure, would
      appear with some softening in contemporary evidence; and it was
      probably veiled by a decree of the senate]

      6111 (return) [ The author here follows the then generally
      received opinion of Heineccius. The proofs which appear to
      confirm it are l. 2 47, D. I. 2, and 8. Instit. I. 2. The first
      of these passages speaks expressly of a privilege granted to
      certain lawyers, until the time of Adrian, publice respondendi
      jus ante Augusti tempora non dabatur. Primus Divus ut major juris
      auctoritas haberetur, constituit, ut ex auctoritate ejus
      responderent. The passage of the Institutes speaks of the
      different opinions of those, quibus est permissum jura condere.
      It is true that the first of these passages does not say that the
      opinion of these privileged lawyers had the force of a law for
      the judges. For this reason M. Hugo altogether rejects the
      opinion adopted by Heineccius, by Bach, and in general by all the
      writers who preceded him. He conceives that the 8 of the
      Institutes referred to the constitution of Valentinian III.,
      which regulated the respective authority to be ascribed to the
      different writings of the great civilians. But we have now the
      following passage in the Institutes of Gaius: Responsa prudentum
      sunt sententiae et opiniones eorum, quibus permissum est jura
      condere; quorum omnium si in unum sententiae concorrupt, id quod
      ita sentiunt, legis vicem obtinet, si vero dissentiunt, judici
      licet, quam velit sententiam sequi, idque rescripto Divi Hadrian
      signiticatur. I do not know, how in opposition to this passage,
      the opinion of M. Hugo can be maintained. We must add to this the
      passage quoted from Pomponius and from such strong proofs, it
      seems incontestable that the emperors had granted some kind of
      privilege to certain civilians, quibus permissum erat jura
      condere. Their opinion had sometimes the force of law, legis
      vicem. M. Hugo, endeavoring to reconcile this phrase with his
      system, gives it a forced interpretation, which quite alters the
      sense; he supposes that the passage contains no more than what is
      evident of itself, that the authority of the civilians was to be
      respected, thus making a privilege of that which was free to all
      the world. It appears to me almost indisputable, that the
      emperors had sanctioned certain provisions relative to the
      authority of these civilians, consulted by the judges. But how
      far was their advice to be respected? This is a question which it
      is impossible to answer precisely, from the want of historic
      evidence. Is it not possible that the emperors established an
      authority to be consulted by the judges? and in this case this
      authority must have emanated from certain civilians named for
      this purpose by the emperors. See Hugo, l. c. Moreover, may not
      the passage of Suetonius, in the Life of Caligula, where he says
      that the emperor would no longer permit the civilians to give
      their advice, mean that Caligula entertained the design of
      suppressing this institution? See on this passage the Themis,
      vol. xi. p. 17, 36. Our author not being acquainted with the
      opinions opposed to Heineccius has not gone to the bottom of the
      subject.—W.]

      The most absolute mandate could only require that the judges
      should agree with the civilians, if the civilians agreed among
      themselves. But positive institutions are often the result of
      custom and prejudice; laws and language are ambiguous and
      arbitrary; where reason is incapable of pronouncing, the love of
      argument is inflamed by the envy of rivals, the vanity of
      masters, the blind attachment of their disciples; and the Roman
      jurisprudence was divided by the once famous sects of the
      Proculians and Sabinians. 62 Two sages of the law, Ateius Capito
      and Antistius Labeo, 63 adorned the peace of the Augustan age;
      the former distinguished by the favor of his sovereign; the
      latter more illustrious by his contempt of that favor, and his
      stern though harmless opposition to the tyrant of Rome. Their
      legal studies were influenced by the various colors of their
      temper and principles. Labeo was attached to the form of the old
      republic; his rival embraced the more profitable substance of the
      rising monarchy. But the disposition of a courtier is tame and
      submissive; and Capito seldom presumed to deviate from the
      sentiments, or at least from the words, of his predecessors;
      while the bold republican pursued his independent ideas without
      fear of paradox or innovations. The freedom of Labeo was
      enslaved, however, by the rigor of his own conclusions, and he
      decided, according to the letter of the law, the same questions
      which his indulgent competitor resolved with a latitude of equity
      more suitable to the common sense and feelings of mankind. If a
      fair exchange had been substituted to the payment of money,
      Capito still considered the transaction as a legal sale; 64 and
      he consulted nature for the age of puberty, without confining his
      definition to the precise period of twelve or fourteen years. 65
      This opposition of sentiments was propagated in the writings and
      lessons of the two founders; the schools of Capito and Labeo
      maintained their inveterate conflict from the age of Augustus to
      that of Adrian; 66 and the two sects derived their appellations
      from Sabinus and Proculus, their most celebrated teachers. The
      names of Cassians and Pegasians were likewise applied to the same
      parties; but, by a strange reverse, the popular cause was in the
      hands of Pegasus, 67 a timid slave of Domitian, while the
      favorite of the Caesars was represented by Cassius, 68 who
      gloried in his descent from the patriot assassin. By the
      perpetual edict, the controversies of the sects were in a great
      measure determined. For that important work, the emperor Adrian
      preferred the chief of the Sabinians: the friends of monarchy
      prevailed; but the moderation of Salvius Julian insensibly
      reconciled the victors and the vanquished. Like the contemporary
      philosophers, the lawyers of the age of the Antonines disclaimed
      the authority of a master, and adopted from every system the most
      probable doctrines. 69 But their writings would have been less
      voluminous, had their choice been more unanimous. The conscience
      of the judge was perplexed by the number and weight of discordant
      testimonies, and every sentence that his passion or interest
      might pronounce was justified by the sanction of some venerable
      name. An indulgent edict of the younger Theodosius excused him
      from the labor of comparing and weighing their arguments. Five
      civilians, Caius, Papinian, Paul, Ulpian, and Modestinus, were
      established as the oracles of jurisprudence: a majority was
      decisive: but if their opinions were equally divided, a casting
      vote was ascribed to the superior wisdom of Papinian. 70

      reports (gesta) of the sitting of the senate at Rome, in which
      the Code was published, in the year after the marriage of
      Valentinian III. Among these pieces are the constitutions which
      nominate commissioners for the formation of the Code; and though
      there are many points of considerable obscurity in these
      documents, they communicate many facts relative to this
      legislation. 1. That Theodosius designed a great reform in the
      legislation; to add to the Gregorian and Hermogenian codes all
      the new constitutions from Constantine to his own day; and to
      frame a second code for common use with extracts from the three
      codes, and from the works of the civil lawyers. All laws either
      abrogated or fallen into disuse were to be noted under their
      proper heads. 2. An Ordinance was issued in 429 to form a
      commission for this purpose of nine persons, of which Antiochus,
      as quaestor and praefectus, was president. A second commission of
      sixteen members was issued in 435 under the same president. 3. A
      code, which we possess under the name of Codex Theodosianus, was
      finished in 438, published in the East, in an ordinance addressed
      to the Praetorian praefect, Florentinus, and intended to be
      published in the West. 4. Before it was published in the West,
      Valentinian submitted it to the senate. There is a report of the
      proceedings of the senate, which closed with loud acclamations
      and gratulations.—From Warnkonig, Histoire du Droit Romain, p.

      Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence.—Part IV.

      When Justinian ascended the throne, the reformation of the Roman
      jurisprudence was an arduous but indispensable task. In the space
      of ten centuries, the infinite variety of laws and legal opinions
      had filled many thousand volumes, which no fortune could purchase
      and no capacity could digest. Books could not easily be found;
      and the judges, poor in the midst of riches, were reduced to the
      exercise of their illiterate discretion. The subjects of the
      Greek provinces were ignorant of the language that disposed of
      their lives and properties; and the barbarous dialect of the
      Latins was imperfectly studied in the academies of Berytus and
      Constantinople. As an Illyrian soldier, that idiom was familiar
      to the infancy of Justinian; his youth had been instructed by the
      lessons of jurisprudence, and his Imperial choice selected the
      most learned civilians of the East, to labor with their sovereign
      in the work of reformation. 71 The theory of professors was
      assisted by the practice of advocates, and the experience of
      magistrates; and the whole undertaking was animated by the spirit
      of Tribonian. 72 This extraordinary man, the object of so much
      praise and censure, was a native of Side in Pamphylia; and his
      genius, like that of Bacon, embraced, as his own, all the
      business and knowledge of the age. Tribonian composed, both in
      prose and verse, on a strange diversity of curious and abstruse
      subjects: 73 a double panegyric of Justinian and the life of the
      philosopher Theodotus; the nature of happiness and the duties of
      government; Homer’s catalogue and the four-and-twenty sorts of
      metre; the astronomical canon of Ptolemy; the changes of the
      months; the houses of the planets; and the harmonic system of the
      world. To the literature of Greece he added the use of the Latin
      tonque; the Roman civilians were deposited in his library and in
      his mind; and he most assiduously cultivated those arts which
      opened the road of wealth and preferment. From the bar of the
      Praetorian praefects, he raised himself to the honors of
      quaestor, of consul, and of master of the offices: the council of
      Justinian listened to his eloquence and wisdom; and envy was
      mitigated by the gentleness and affability of his manners. The
      reproaches of impiety and avarice have stained the virtue or the
      reputation of Tribonian. In a bigoted and persecuting court, the
      principal minister was accused of a secret aversion to the
      Christian faith, and was supposed to entertain the sentiments of
      an Atheist and a Pagan, which have been imputed, inconsistently
      enough, to the last philosophers of Greece. His avarice was more
      clearly proved and more sensibly felt. If he were swayed by gifts
      in the administration of justice, the example of Bacon will again
      occur; nor can the merit of Tribonian atone for his baseness, if
      he degraded the sanctity of his profession; and if laws were
      every day enacted, modified, or repealed, for the base
      consideration of his private emolument. In the sedition of
      Constantinople, his removal was granted to the clamors, perhaps
      to the just indignation, of the people: but the quaestor was
      speedily restored, and, till the hour of his death, he possessed,
      above twenty years, the favor and confidence of the emperor. His
      passive and dutiful submission had been honored with the praise
      of Justinian himself, whose vanity was incapable of discerning
      how often that submission degenerated into the grossest
      adulation. Tribonian adored the virtues of his gracious of his
      gracious master; the earth was unworthy of such a prince; and he
      affected a pious fear, that Justinian, like Elijah or Romulus,
      would be snatched into the air, and translated alive to the
      mansions of celestial glory. 74

      Augustus; and the sage Boileau has not blushed to say, “Le destin
      a ses yeux n’oseroit balancer” Yet neither Augustus nor Louis
      XIV. were fools.]

      If Caesar had achieved the reformation of the Roman law, his
      creative genius, enlightened by reflection and study, would have
      given to the world a pure and original system of jurisprudence.
      Whatever flattery might suggest, the emperor of the East was
      afraid to establish his private judgment as the standard of
      equity: in the possession of legislative power, he borrowed the
      aid of time and opinion; and his laborious compilations are
      guarded by the sages and legislature of past times. Instead of a
      statue cast in a simple mould by the hand of an artist, the works
      of Justinian represent a tessellated pavement of antique and
      costly, but too often of incoherent, fragments. In the first year
      of his reign, he directed the faithful Tribonian, and nine
      learned associates, to revise the ordinances of his predecessors,
      as they were contained, since the time of Adrian, in the
      Gregorian Hermogenian, and Theodosian codes; to purge the errors
      and contradictions, to retrench whatever was obsolete or
      superfluous, and to select the wise and salutary laws best
      adapted to the practice of the tribunals and the use of his
      subjects. The work was accomplished in fourteen months; and the
      twelve books or tables, which the new decemvirs produced, might
      be designed to imitate the labors of their Roman predecessors.
      The new Code of Justinian was honored with his name, and
      confirmed by his royal signature: authentic transcripts were
      multiplied by the pens of notaries and scribes; they were
      transmitted to the magistrates of the European, the Asiatic, and
      afterwards the African provinces; and the law of the empire was
      proclaimed on solemn festivals at the doors of churches. A more
      arduous operation was still behind—to extract the spirit of
      jurisprudence from the decisions and conjectures, the questions
      and disputes, of the Roman civilians. Seventeen lawyers, with
      Tribonian at their head, were appointed by the emperor to
      exercise an absolute jurisdiction over the works of their
      predecessors. If they had obeyed his commands in ten years,
      Justinian would have been satisfied with their diligence; and the
      rapid composition of the Digest of Pandects, 75 in three years,
      will deserve praise or censure, according to the merit of the
      execution. From the library of Tribonian, they chose forty, the
      most eminent civilians of former times: 76 two thousand treatises
      were comprised in an abridgment of fifty books; and it has been
      carefully recorded, that three millions of lines or sentences, 77
      were reduced, in this abstract, to the moderate number of one
      hundred and fifty thousand. The edition of this great work was
      delayed a month after that of the Institutes; and it seemed
      reasonable that the elements should precede the digest of the
      Roman law. As soon as the emperor had approved their labors, he
      ratified, by his legislative power, the speculations of these
      private citizens: their commentaries, on the twelve tables, the
      perpetual edict, the laws of the people, and the decrees of the
      senate, succeeded to the authority of the text; and the text was
      abandoned, as a useless, though venerable, relic of antiquity.
      The Code, the Pandects, and the Institutes, were declared to be
      the legitimate system of civil jurisprudence; they alone were
      admitted into the tribunals, and they alone were taught in the
      academies of Rome, Constantinople, and Berytus. Justinian
      addressed to the senate and provinces his eternal oracles; and
      his pride, under the mask of piety, ascribed the consummation of
      this great design to the support and inspiration of the Deity.

      Scaevola, Marcellinus, Celsus, were already familiar to the
      civilians: but Justinian was in the wrong when he used the two
      appellations as synonymous. Is the word Pandects Greek or
      Latin—masculine or feminine? The diligent Brenckman will not
      presume to decide these momentous controversies, (Hist. Pandect.

      index to the Pandects enumerates thirty-nine, and forty are
      produced by the indefatigable Fabricius, (Bibliot. Graec. tom.
      iii. p. 488—502.) Antoninus Augustus (de Nominibus Propriis
      Pandect. apud Ludewig, p. 283) is said to have added fifty-four
      names; but they must be vague or second-hand references.]

      77 (return) [ The item of the ancient Mss. may be strictly
      defined as sentences or periods of a complete sense, which, on
      the breadth of the parchment rolls or volumes, composed as many
      lines of unequal length. The number in each book served as a
      check on the errors of the scribes, (Ludewig, p. 211—215; and his
      original author Suicer. Thesaur. Ecclesiast. tom. i. p
      1021-1036).]

      Since the emperor declined the fame and envy of original
      composition, we can only require, at his hands, method choice,
      and fidelity, the humble, though indispensable, virtues of a
      compiler. Among the various combinations of ideas, it is
      difficult to assign any reasonable preference; but as the order
      of Justinian is different in his three works, it is possible that
      all may be wrong; and it is certain that two cannot be right. In
      the selection of ancient laws, he seems to have viewed his
      predecessors without jealousy, and with equal regard: the series
      could not ascend above the reign of Adrian, and the narrow
      distinction of Paganism and Christianity, introduced by the
      superstition of Theodosius, had been abolished by the consent of
      mankind. But the jurisprudence of the Pandects is circumscribed
      within a period of a hundred years, from the perpetual edict to
      the death of Severus Alexander: the civilians who lived under the
      first Caesars are seldom permitted to speak, and only three names
      can be attributed to the age of the republic. The favorite of
      Justinian (it has been fiercely urged) was fearful of
      encountering the light of freedom and the gravity of Roman sages.

      Tribonian condemned to oblivion the genuine and native wisdom of
      Cato, the Scaevolas, and Sulpicius; while he invoked spirits more
      congenial to his own, the Syrians, Greeks, and Africans, who
      flocked to the Imperial court to study Latin as a foreign tongue,
      and jurisprudence as a lucrative profession. But the ministers of
      Justinian, 78 were instructed to labor, not for the curiosity of
      antiquarians, but for the immediate benefit of his subjects. It
      was their duty to select the useful and practical parts of the
      Roman law; and the writings of the old republicans, however
      curious or excellent, were no longer suited to the new system of
      manners, religion, and government. Perhaps, if the preceptors and
      friends of Cicero were still alive, our candor would acknowledge,
      that, except in purity of language, 79 their intrinsic merit was
      excelled by the school of Papinian and Ulpian. The science of the
      laws is the slow growth of time and experience, and the advantage
      both of method and materials, is naturally assumed by the most
      recent authors. The civilians of the reign of the Antonines had
      studied the works of their predecessors: their philosophic spirit
      had mitigated the rigor of antiquity, simplified the forms of
      proceeding, and emerged from the jealousy and prejudice of the
      rival sects. The choice of the authorities that compose the
      Pandects depended on the judgment of Tribonian: but the power of
      his sovereign could not absolve him from the sacred obligations
      of truth and fidelity. As the legislator of the empire, Justinian
      might repeal the acts of the Antonines, or condemn, as seditious,
      the free principles, which were maintained by the last of the
      Roman lawyers. 80 But the existence of past facts is placed
      beyond the reach of despotism; and the emperor was guilty of
      fraud and forgery, when he corrupted the integrity of their text,
      inscribed with their venerable names the words and ideas of his
      servile reign, 81 and suppressed, by the hand of power, the pure
      and authentic copies of their sentiments. The changes and
      interpolations of Tribonian and his colleagues are excused by the
      pretence of uniformity: but their cares have been insufficient,
      and the antinomies, or contradictions of the Code and Pandects,
      still exercise the patience and subtilty of modern civilians. 82

      79 (return) [ Strip away the crust of Tribonian, and allow for

      attacked by Laurentius Valla, a fastidious grammarian of the xvth
      century, and by his apologist Floridus Sabinus. It has been
      defended by Alciat, and a name less advocate, (most probably
      James Capellus.) Their various treatises are collected by Duker,
      (Opuscula de Latinitate veterum Jurisconsultorum, Lugd. Bat.
      1721, in 12mo.) Note: Gibbon is mistaken with regard to Valla,
      who, though he inveighs against the barbarous style of the
      civilians of his own day, lavishes the highest praise on the
      admirable purity of the language of the ancient writers on civil
      law. (M. Warnkonig quotes a long passage of Valla in
      justification of this observation.) Since his time, this truth
      has been recognized by men of the highest eminence, such as
      Erasmus, David Hume and Runkhenius.—W.]

      82 (return) [ The antinomies, or opposite laws of the Code and

      glorious uncertainty of the civil law, which so often affords
      what Montaigne calls “Questions pour l’Ami.” See a fine passage
      of Franciscus Balduinus in Justinian, (l. ii. p. 259, &c., apud
      Ludewig, p. 305, 306.)]

      A rumor devoid of evidence has been propagated by the enemies of
      Justinian; that the jurisprudence of ancient Rome was reduced to
      ashes by the author of the Pandects, from the vain persuasion,
      that it was now either false or superfluous. Without usurping an
      office so invidious, the emperor might safely commit to ignorance
      and time the accomplishments of this destructive wish. Before the
      invention of printing and paper, the labor and the materials of
      writing could be purchased only by the rich; and it may
      reasonably be computed, that the price of books was a hundred
      fold their present value. 83 Copies were slowly multiplied and
      cautiously renewed: the hopes of profit tempted the sacrilegious
      scribes to erase the characters of antiquity, 8311 and Sophocles
      or Tacitus were obliged to resign the parchment to missals,
      homilies, and the golden legend. 84 If such was the fate of the
      most beautiful compositions of genius, what stability could be
      expected for the dull and barren works of an obsolete science?
      The books of jurisprudence were interesting to few, and
      entertaining to none: their value was connected with present use,
      and they sunk forever as soon as that use was superseded by the
      innovations of fashion, superior merit, or public authority. In
      the age of peace and learning, between Cicero and the last of the
      Antonines, many losses had been already sustained, and some
      luminaries of the school, or forum, were known only to the
      curious by tradition and report. Three hundred and sixty years of
      disorder and decay accelerated the progress of oblivion; and it
      may fairly be presumed, that of the writings, which Justinian is
      accused of neglecting, many were no longer to be found in the
      libraries of the East. 85 The copies of Papinian, or Ulpian,
      which the reformer had proscribed, were deemed unworthy of future
      notice: the Twelve Tables and praetorian edicts insensibly
      vanished, and the monuments of ancient Rome were neglected or
      destroyed by the envy and ignorance of the Greeks. Even the
      Pandects themselves have escaped with difficulty and danger from
      the common shipwreck, and criticism has pronounced that all the
      editions and manuscripts of the West are derived from one
      original. 86 It was transcribed at Constantinople in the
      beginning of the seventh century, 87 was successively transported
      by the accidents of war and commerce to Amalphi, 88 Pisa, 89 and
      Florence, 90 and is now deposited as a sacred relic 91 in the
      ancient palace of the republic. 92

      books which Tribonian never saw; and in the long period from the

      pilgrimage to Florence, where he employed several years in the
      study of a single manuscript. His Historia Pandectarum
      Florentinorum, (Utrecht, 1722, in 4to.,) though a monument of
      industry, is a small portion of his original design.]

      It is the first care of a reformer to prevent any future
      reformation. To maintain the text of the Pandects, the
      Institutes, and the Code, the use of ciphers and abbreviations
      was rigorously proscribed; and as Justinian recollected, that the
      perpetual edict had been buried under the weight of commentators,
      he denounced the punishment of forgery against the rash civilians
      who should presume to interpret or pervert the will of their
      sovereign. The scholars of Accursius, of Bartolus, of Cujacius,
      should blush for their accumulated guilt, unless they dare to
      dispute his right of binding the authority of his successors, and
      the native freedom of the mind. But the emperor was unable to fix
      his own inconstancy; and, while he boasted of renewing the
      exchange of Diomede, of transmuting brass into gold, 93
      discovered the necessity of purifying his gold from the mixture
      of baser alloy. Six years had not elapsed from the publication of
      the Code, before he condemned the imperfect attempt, by a new and
      more accurate edition of the same work; which he enriched with
      two hundred of his own laws, and fifty decisions of the darkest
      and most intricate points of jurisprudence. Every year, or,
      according to Procopius, each day, of his long reign, was marked
      by some legal innovation. Many of his acts were rescinded by
      himself; many were rejected by his successors; many have been
      obliterated by time; but the number of sixteen Edicts, and one
      hundred and sixty-eight Novels, 94 has been admitted into the
      authentic body of the civil jurisprudence. In the opinion of a
      philosopher superior to the prejudices of his profession, these
      incessant, and, for the most part, trifling alterations, can be
      only explained by the venal spirit of a prince, who sold without
      shame his judgments and his laws. 95 The charge of the secret
      historian is indeed explicit and vehement; but the sole instance,
      which he produces, may be ascribed to the devotion as well as to
      the avarice of Justinian. A wealthy bigot had bequeathed his
      inheritance to the church of Emesa; and its value was enhanced by
      the dexterity of an artist, who subscribed confessions of debt
      and promises of payment with the names of the richest Syrians.
      They pleaded the established prescription of thirty or forty
      years; but their defence was overruled by a retrospective edict,
      which extended the claims of the church to the term of a century;
      an edict so pregnant with injustice and disorder, that, after
      serving this occasional purpose, it was prudently abolished in
      the same reign. 96 If candor will acquit the emperor himself, and
      transfer the corruption to his wife and favorites, the suspicion
      of so foul a vice must still degrade the majesty of his laws; and
      the advocates of Justinian may acknowledge, that such levity,
      whatsoever be the motive, is unworthy of a legislator and a man.

      Monarchs seldom condescend to become the preceptors of their
      subjects; and some praise is due to Justinian, by whose command
      an ample system was reduced to a short and elementary treatise.
      Among the various institutes of the Roman law, 97 those of Caius
      98 were the most popular in the East and West; and their use may
      be considered as an evidence of their merit. They were selected
      by the Imperial delegates, Tribonian, Theophilus, and Dorotheus;

      introduced the youth of Rome, Constantinople, and Berytus, to the
      gradual study of the Code and Pandects, is still precious to the
      historian, the philosopher, and the magistrate. The Institutes of

      Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence.—Part V.

      The distinction of ranks and persons is the firmest basis of a
      mixed and limited government. In France, the remains of liberty
      are kept alive by the spirit, the honors, and even the
      prejudices, of fifty thousand nobles. 99 Two hundred families
      9911 supply, in lineal descent, the second branch of English
      legislature, which maintains, between the king and commons, the
      balance of the constitution. A gradation of patricians and
      plebeians, of strangers and subjects, has supported the
      aristocracy of Genoa, Venice, and ancient Rome. The perfect
      equality of men is the point in which the extremes of democracy
      and despotism are confounded; since the majesty of the prince or
      people would be offended, if any heads were exalted above the
      level of their fellow-slaves or fellow-citizens. In the decline
      of the Roman empire, the proud distinctions of the republic were
      gradually abolished, and the reason or instinct of Justinian
      completed the simple form of an absolute monarchy. The emperor
      could not eradicate the popular reverence which always waits on
      the possession of hereditary wealth, or the memory of famous
      ancestors. He delighted to honor, with titles and emoluments, his
      generals, magistrates, and senators; and his precarious
      indulgence communicated some rays of their glory to the persons
      of their wives and children. But in the eye of the law, all Roman
      citizens were equal, and all subjects of the empire were citizens
      of Rome. That inestimable character was degraded to an obsolete
      and empty name. The voice of a Roman could no longer enact his
      laws, or create the annual ministers of his power: his
      constitutional rights might have checked the arbitrary will of a
      master: and the bold adventurer from Germany or Arabia was
      admitted, with equal favor, to the civil and military command,
      which the citizen alone had been once entitled to assume over the
      conquests of his fathers. The first Caesars had scrupulously
      guarded the distinction of ingenuous and servile birth, which was
      decided by the condition of the mother; and the candor of the
      laws was satisfied, if her freedom could be ascertained, during a
      single moment, between the conception and the delivery. The
      slaves, who were liberated by a generous master, immediately
      entered into the middle class of libertines or freedmen; but they
      could never be enfranchised from the duties of obedience and
      gratitude; whatever were the fruits of their industry, their
      patron and his family inherited the third part; or even the whole
      of their fortune, if they died without children and without a
      testament. Justinian respected the rights of patrons; but his
      indulgence removed the badge of disgrace from the two inferior
      orders of freedmen; whoever ceased to be a slave, obtained,
      without reserve or delay, the station of a citizen; and at length
      the dignity of an ingenuous birth, which nature had refused, was
      created, or supposed, by the omnipotence of the emperor. Whatever
      restraints of age, or forms, or numbers, had been formerly
      introduced to check the abuse of manumissions, and the too rapid
      increase of vile and indigent Romans, he finally abolished; and
      the spirit of his laws promoted the extinction of domestic
      servitude. Yet the eastern provinces were filled, in the time of
      Justinian, with multitudes of slaves, either born or purchased
      for the use of their masters; and the price, from ten to seventy
      pieces of gold, was determined by their age, their strength, and
      their education. 100 But the hardships of this dependent state
      were continually diminished by the influence of government and
      religion: and the pride of a subject was no longer elated by his
      absolute dominion over the life and happiness of his bondsman.

      The law of nature instructs most animals to cherish and educate
      their infant progeny. The law of reason inculcates to the human
      species the returns of filial piety. But the exclusive, absolute,
      and perpetual dominion of the father over his children, is
      peculiar to the Roman jurisprudence, 102 and seems to be coeval
      with the foundation of the city. 103 The paternal power was
      instituted or confirmed by Romulus himself; and, after the
      practice of three centuries, it was inscribed on the fourth table
      of the Decemvirs. In the forum, the senate, or the camp, the
      adult son of a Roman citizen enjoyed the public and private
      rights of a person: in his father’s house he was a mere thing;
      1031 confounded by the laws with the movables, the cattle, and
      the slaves, whom the capricious master might alienate or destroy,
      without being responsible to any earthly tribunal. The hand which
      bestowed the daily sustenance might resume the voluntary gift,
      and whatever was acquired by the labor or fortune of the son was
      immediately lost in the property of the father. His stolen goods
      (his oxen or his children) might be recovered by the same action
      of theft; 104 and if either had been guilty of a trespass, it was
      in his own option to compensate the damage, or resign to the
      injured party the obnoxious animal. At the call of indigence or
      avarice, the master of a family could dispose of his children or
      his slaves. But the condition of the slave was far more
      advantageous, since he regained, by the first manumission, his
      alienated freedom: the son was again restored to his unnatural
      father; he might be condemned to servitude a second and a third
      time, and it was not till after the third sale and deliverance,
      105 that he was enfranchised from the domestic power which had
      been so repeatedly abused. According to his discretion, a father
      might chastise the real or imaginary faults of his children, by
      stripes, by imprisonment, by exile, by sending them to the
      country to work in chains among the meanest of his servants. The
      majesty of a parent was armed with the power of life and death;
      106 and the examples of such bloody executions, which were
      sometimes praised and never punished, may be traced in the annals
      of Rome beyond the times of Pompey and Augustus. Neither age, nor
      rank, nor the consular office, nor the honors of a triumph, could
      exempt the most illustrious citizen from the bonds of filial
      subjection: 107 his own descendants were included in the family
      of their common ancestor; and the claims of adoption were not
      less sacred or less rigorous than those of nature. Without fear,
      though not without danger of abuse, the Roman legislators had
      reposed an unbounded confidence in the sentiments of paternal
      love; and the oppression was tempered by the assurance that each
      generation must succeed in its turn to the awful dignity of
      parent and master.

      example of Fabius; and we may contemplate the same story in the
      style of Livy (xxiv. 44) and the homely idiom of Claudius Quadri
      garius the annalist.]

      The first limitation of paternal power is ascribed to the justice
      and humanity of Numa; and the maid who, with his father’s
      consent, had espoused a freeman, was protected from the disgrace
      of becoming the wife of a slave. In the first ages, when the city
      was pressed, and often famished, by her Latin and Tuscan
      neighbors, the sale of children might be a frequent practice; but
      as a Roman could not legally purchase the liberty of his
      fellow-citizen, the market must gradually fail, and the trade
      would be destroyed by the conquests of the republic. An imperfect
      right of property was at length communicated to sons; and the
      threefold distinction of profectitious, adventitious, and
      professional was ascertained by the jurisprudence of the Code and
      Pandects. 108 Of all that proceeded from the father, he imparted
      only the use, and reserved the absolute dominion; yet if his
      goods were sold, the filial portion was excepted, by a favorable
      interpretation, from the demands of the creditors. In whatever
      accrued by marriage, gift, or collateral succession, the property
      was secured to the son; but the father, unless he had been
      specially excluded, enjoyed the usufruct during his life. As a
      just and prudent reward of military virtue, the spoils of the
      enemy were acquired, possessed, and bequeathed by the soldier
      alone; and the fair analogy was extended to the emoluments of any
      liberal profession, the salary of public service, and the sacred
      liberality of the emperor or empress. The life of a citizen was
      less exposed than his fortune to the abuse of paternal power. Yet
      his life might be adverse to the interest or passions of an
      unworthy father: the same crimes that flowed from the corruption,
      were more sensibly felt by the humanity, of the Augustan age; and
      the cruel Erixo, who whipped his son till he expired, was saved
      by the emperor from the just fury of the multitude. 109 The Roman
      father, from the license of servile dominion, was reduced to the
      gravity and moderation of a judge. The presence and opinion of
      Augustus confirmed the sentence of exile pronounced against an
      intentional parricide by the domestic tribunal of Arius. Adrian
      transported to an island the jealous parent, who, like a robber,
      had seized the opportunity of hunting, to assassinate a youth,
      the incestuous lover of his step-mother. 110 A private
      jurisdiction is repugnant to the spirit of monarchy; the parent
      was again reduced from a judge to an accuser; and the magistrates
      were enjoined by Severus Alexander to hear his complaints and
      execute his sentence. He could no longer take the life of a son
      without incurring the guilt and punishment of murder; and the
      pains of parricide, from which he had been excepted by the
      Pompeian law, were finally inflicted by the justice of
      Constantine. 111 The same protection was due to every period of
      existence; and reason must applaud the humanity of Paulus, for
      imputing the crime of murder to the father who strangles, or
      starves, or abandons his new-born infant; or exposes him in a
      public place to find the mercy which he himself had denied. But
      the exposition of children was the prevailing and stubborn vice
      of antiquity: it was sometimes prescribed, often permitted,
      almost always practised with impunity, by the nations who never
      entertained the Roman ideas of paternal power; and the dramatic
      poets, who appeal to the human heart, represent with indifference
      a popular custom which was palliated by the motives of economy
      and compassion. 112 If the father could subdue his own feelings,
      he might escape, though not the censure, at least the
      chastisement, of the laws; and the Roman empire was stained with
      the blood of infants, till such murders were included, by
      Valentinian and his colleagues, in the letter and spirit of the
      Cornelian law. The lessons of jurisprudence 113 and Christianity
      had been insufficient to eradicate this inhuman practice, till
      their gentle influence was fortified by the terrors of capital
      punishment. 114

      Experience has proved, that savages are the tyrants of the female
      sex, and that the condition of women is usually softened by the
      refinements of social life. In the hope of a robust progeny,

      at the tender age of twelve years, that the Roman husband might
      educate to his will a pure and obedient virgin. 115 According to
      the custom of antiquity, he bought his bride of her parents, and
      she fulfilled the coemption by purchasing, with three pieces of
      copper, a just introduction to his house and household deities. A

      served as an emblem of their mystic union of mind and body. But
      this union on the side of the woman was rigorous and unequal; and
      she renounced the name and worship of her father’s house, to
      embrace a new servitude, decorated only by the title of adoption,
      a fiction of the law, neither rational nor elegant, bestowed on
      the mother of a family 117 (her proper appellation) the strange
      characters of sister to her own children, and of daughter to her
      husband or master, who was invested with the plenitude of
      paternal power. By his judgment or caprice her behavior was
      approved, or censured, or chastised; he exercised the
      jurisdiction of life and death; and it was allowed, that in the
      cases of adultery or drunkenness, 118 the sentence might be
      properly inflicted. She acquired and inherited for the sole
      profit of her lord; and so clearly was woman defined, not as a
      person, but as a thing, that, if the original title were
      deficient, she might be claimed, like other movables, by the use
      and possession of an entire year. The inclination of the Roman
      husband discharged or withheld the conjugal debt, so scrupulously
      exacted by the Athenian and Jewish laws: 119 but as polygamy was
      unknown, he could never admit to his bed a fairer or a more
      favored partner.

      thirty days on a camel-driver; once in six months on a seaman.
      But the student or doctor was free from tribute; and no wife, if
      she received a weekly sustenance, could sue for a divorce; for
      one week a vow of abstinence was allowed. Polygamy divided,
      without multiplying, the duties of the husband, (Selden, Uxor
      Ebraica, l. iii. c 6, in his works, vol ii. p. 717—720.)]

      After the Punic triumphs, the matrons of Rome aspired to the
      common benefits of a free and opulent republic: their wishes were
      gratified by the indulgence of fathers and lovers, and their
      ambition was unsuccessfully resisted by the gravity of Cato the
      Censor. 120 They declined the solemnities of the old nuptiais;
      defeated the annual prescription by an absence of three days;
      and, without losing their name or independence, subscribed the
      liberal and definite terms of a marriage contract. Of their
      private fortunes, they communicated the use, and secured the
      property: the estates of a wife could neither be alienated nor
      mortgaged by a prodigal husband; their mutual gifts were
      prohibited by the jealousy of the laws; and the misconduct of
      either party might afford, under another name, a future subject
      for an action of theft. To this loose and voluntary compact,
      religious and civil rights were no longer essential; and, between
      persons of a similar rank, the apparent community of life was
      allowed as sufficient evidence of their nuptials. The dignity of
      marriage was restored by the Christians, who derived all
      spiritual grace from the prayers of the faithful and the
      benediction of the priest or bishop. The origin, validity, and
      duties of the holy institution were regulated by the tradition of
      the synagogue, the precepts of the gospel, and the canons of
      general or provincial synods; 121 and the conscience of the
      Christians was awed by the decrees and censures of their
      ecclesiastical rulers. Yet the magistrates of Justinian were not
      subject to the authority of the church: the emperor consulted the
      unbelieving civilians of antiquity, and the choice of matrimonial
      laws in the Code and Pandects, is directed by the earthly motives
      of justice, policy, and the natural freedom of both sexes. 122

      (tit. xvi. p. 790, 791,) with the notes of Pithaeus and
      Schulting. They find in the Commentary of Servius (on the 1st
      Georgia and the 4th Aeneid) two curious passages.]

      Besides the agreement of the parties, the essence of every
      rational contract, the Roman marriage required the previous
      approbation of the parents. A father might be forced by some
      recent laws to supply the wants of a mature daughter; but even
      his insanity was not gradually allowed to supersede the necessity
      of his consent. The causes of the dissolution of matrimony have
      varied among the Romans; 123 but the most solemn sacrament, the
      confarreation itself, might always be done away by rites of a
      contrary tendency. In the first ages, the father of a family
      might sell his children, and his wife was reckoned in the number
      of his children: the domestic judge might pronounce the death of
      the offender, or his mercy might expel her from his bed and
      house; but the slavery of the wretched female was hopeless and
      perpetual, unless he asserted for his own convenience the manly
      prerogative of divorce. 1231 The warmest applause has been
      lavished on the virtue of the Romans, who abstained from the
      exercise of this tempting privilege above five hundred years: 124
      but the same fact evinces the unequal terms of a connection in
      which the slave was unable to renounce her tyrant, and the tyrant
      was unwilling to relinquish his slave. When the Roman matrons
      became the equal and voluntary companions of their lords, a new
      jurisprudence was introduced, that marriage, like other
      partnerships, might be dissolved by the abdication of one of the
      associates. In three centuries of prosperity and corruption, this
      principle was enlarged to frequent practice and pernicious abuse.

      Passion, interest, or caprice, suggested daily motives for the
      dissolution of marriage; a word, a sign, a message, a letter, the
      mandate of a freedman, declared the separation; the most tender
      of human connections was degraded to a transient society of
      profit or pleasure. According to the various conditions of life,
      both sexes alternately felt the disgrace and injury: an
      inconstant spouse transferred her wealth to a new family,
      abandoning a numerous, perhaps a spurious, progeny to the
      paternal authority and care of her late husband; a beautiful
      virgin might be dismissed to the world, old, indigent, and
      friendless; but the reluctance of the Romans, when they were
      pressed to marriage by Augustus, sufficiently marks, that the
      prevailing institutions were least favorable to the males. A
      specious theory is confuted by this free and perfect experiment,
      which demonstrates, that the liberty of divorce does not
      contribute to happiness and virtue. The facility of separation
      would destroy all mutual confidence, and inflame every trifling
      dispute: the minute difference between a husband and a stranger,
      which might so easily be removed, might still more easily be
      forgotten; and the matron, who in five years can submit to the
      embraces of eight husbands, must cease to reverence the chastity
      of her own person. 125

      123 (return) [ According to Plutarch, (p. 57,) Romulus allowed
      only three grounds of a divorce—drunkenness, adultery, and false
      keys. Otherwise, the husband who abused his supremacy forfeited
      half his goods to the wife, and half to the goddess Ceres, and
      offered a sacrifice (with the remainder?) to the terrestrial
      deities. This strange law was either imaginary or transient.]

      1; Aulus Gellius, iv. 3.) He was questioned by the censors, and
      hated by the people; but his divorce stood unimpeached in law.]

      125 (return) [—Sic fiunt octo mariti Quinque per autumnos.
      Juvenal, Satir. vi. 20.—A rapid succession, which may yet be
      credible, as well as the non consulum numero, sed maritorum annos
      suos computant, of Seneca, (de Beneficiis, iii. 16.) Jerom saw at
      Rome a triumphant husband bury his twenty-first wife, who had
      interred twenty-two of his less sturdy predecessors, (Opp. tom.
      i. p. 90, ad Gerontiam.) But the ten husbands in a month of the
      poet Martial, is an extravagant hyperbole, (l. 71. epigram 7.)]

      Insufficient remedies followed with distant and tardy steps the
      rapid progress of the evil. The ancient worship of the Romans
      afforded a peculiar goddess to hear and reconcile the complaints
      of a married life; but her epithet of Viriplaca, 126 the appeaser
      of husbands, too clearly indicates on which side submission and
      repentance were always expected. Every act of a citizen was
      subject to the judgment of the censors; the first who used the
      privilege of divorce assigned, at their command, the motives of
      his conduct; 127 and a senator was expelled for dismissing his
      virgin spouse without the knowledge or advice of his friends.
      Whenever an action was instituted for the recovery of a marriage
      portion, the proetor, as the guardian of equity, examined the
      cause and the characters, and gently inclined the scale in favor
      of the guiltless and injured party. Augustus, who united the
      powers of both magistrates, adopted their different modes of
      repressing or chastising the license of divorce. 128 The presence
      of seven Roman witnesses was required for the validity of this
      solemn and deliberate act: if any adequate provocation had been
      given by the husband, instead of the delay of two years, he was
      compelled to refund immediately, or in the space of six months;
      but if he could arraign the manners of his wife, her guilt or
      levity was expiated by the loss of the sixth or eighth part of
      her marriage portion. The Christian princes were the first who
      specified the just causes of a private divorce; their
      institutions, from Constantine to Justinian, appear to fluctuate
      between the custom of the empire and the wishes of the church,
      129 and the author of the Novels too frequently reforms the
      jurisprudence of the Code and Pandects. In the most rigorous
      laws, a wife was condemned to support a gamester, a drunkard, or
      a libertine, unless he were guilty of homicide, poison, or
      sacrilege, in which cases the marriage, as it should seem, might
      have been dissolved by the hand of the executioner. But the
      sacred right of the husband was invariably maintained, to deliver
      his name and family from the disgrace of adultery: the list of
      mortal sins, either male or female, was curtailed and enlarged by
      successive regulations, and the obstacles of incurable impotence,
      long absence, and monastic profession, were allowed to rescind
      the matrimonial obligation. Whoever transgressed the permission
      of the law, was subject to various and heavy penalties. The woman
      was stripped of her wealth and ornaments, without excepting the
      bodkin of her hair: if the man introduced a new bride into his
      bed, her fortune might be lawfully seized by the vengeance of his
      exiled wife. Forfeiture was sometimes commuted to a fine; the
      fine was sometimes aggravated by transportation to an island, or
      imprisonment in a monastery; the injured party was released from
      the bonds of marriage; but the offender, during life, or a term
      of years, was disabled from the repetition of nuptials. The
      successor of Justinian yielded to the prayers of his unhappy
      subjects, and restored the liberty of divorce by mutual consent:
      the civilians were unanimous, 130 the theologians were divided,
      131 and the ambiguous word, which contains the precept of Christ,
      is flexible to any interpretation that the wisdom of a legislator
      can demand.

      and modern! There are two (Mark, x. 11, Luke, xvi. 18) to one
      (Matthew, xix. 9) that such ground of divorce was not excepted by
      Jesus. Some critics have presumed to think, by an evasive answer,
      he avoided the giving offence either to the school of Sammai or
      to that of Hillel, (Selden, Uxor Ebraica, l. iii. c. 18—22, 28,

      The freedom of love and marriage was restrained among the Romans
      by natural and civil impediments. An instinct, almost innate and
      universal, appears to prohibit the incestuous commerce 132 of
      parents and children in the infinite series of ascending and
      descending generations. Concerning the oblique and collateral
      branches, nature is indifferent, reason mute, and custom various
      and arbitrary. In Egypt, the marriage of brothers and sisters was
      admitted without scruple or exception: a Spartan might espouse
      the daughter of his father, an Athenian, that of his mother; and
      the nuptials of an uncle with his niece were applauded at Athens
      as a happy union of the dearest relations. The profane lawgivers
      of Rome were never tempted by interest or superstition to
      multiply the forbidden degrees: but they inflexibly condemned the
      marriage of sisters and brothers, hesitated whether first cousins
      should be touched by the same interdict; revered the parental
      character of aunts and uncles, 1321 and treated affinity and
      adoption as a just imitation of the ties of blood. According to
      the proud maxims of the republic, a legal marriage could only be
      contracted by free citizens; an honorable, at least an ingenuous
      birth, was required for the spouse of a senator: but the blood of
      kings could never mingle in legitimate nuptials with the blood of
      a Roman; and the name of Stranger degraded Cleopatra and
      Berenice, 133 to live the concubines of Mark Antony and Titus.
      134 This appellation, indeed, so injurious to the majesty, cannot
      without indulgence be applied to the manners, of these Oriental
      queens. A concubine, in the strict sense of the civilians, was a
      woman of servile or plebeian extraction, the sole and faithful
      companion of a Roman citizen, who continued in a state of
      celibacy. Her modest station, below the honors of a wife, above
      the infamy of a prostitute, was acknowledged and approved by the
      laws: from the age of Augustus to the tenth century, the use of
      this secondary marriage prevailed both in the West and East; and
      the humble virtues of a concubine were often preferred to the
      pomp and insolence of a noble matron. In this connection, the two
      Antonines, the best of princes and of men, enjoyed the comforts
      of domestic love: the example was imitated by many citizens
      impatient of celibacy, but regardful of their families. If at any
      time they desired to legitimate their natural children, the
      conversion was instantly performed by the celebration of their
      nuptials with a partner whose faithfulness and fidelity they had
      already tried. 1341 By this epithet of natural, the offspring of
      the concubine were distinguished from the spurious brood of
      adultery, prostitution, and incest, to whom Justinian reluctantly
      grants the necessary aliments of life; and these natural children
      alone were capable of succeeding to a sixth part of the
      inheritance of their reputed father. According to the rigor of
      law, bastards were entitled only to the name and condition of
      their mother, from whom they might derive the character of a
      slave, a stranger, or a citizen. The outcasts of every family
      were adopted without reproach as the children of the state. 135

      near legitimate relatives, the inheritance went to the fiscus.

      Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence.—Part VI.

      The relation of guardian and ward, or in Roman words of tutor and
      pupil, which covers so many titles of the Institutes and
      Pandects, 136 is of a very simple and uniform nature. The person
      and property of an orphan must always be trusted to the custody
      of some discreet friend. If the deceased father had not signified
      his choice, the agnats, or paternal kindred of the nearest
      degree, were compelled to act as the natural guardians: the
      Athenians were apprehensive of exposing the infant to the power
      of those most interested in his death; but an axiom of Roman
      jurisprudence has pronounced, that the charge of tutelage should
      constantly attend the emolument of succession. If the choice of
      the father, and the line of consanguinity, afforded no efficient
      guardian, the failure was supplied by the nomination of the
      praetor of the city, or the president of the province. But the
      person whom they named to this public office might be legally
      excused by insanity or blindness, by ignorance or inability, by
      previous enmity or adverse interest, by the number of children or
      guardianships with which he was already burdened, and by the
      immunities which were granted to the useful labors of
      magistrates, lawyers, physicians, and professors. Till the infant
      could speak, and think, he was represented by the tutor, whose
      authority was finally determined by the age of puberty. Without
      his consent, no act of the pupil could bind himself to his own
      prejudice, though it might oblige others for his personal
      benefit. It is needless to observe, that the tutor often gave
      security, and always rendered an account, and that the want of
      diligence or integrity exposed him to a civil and almost criminal
      action for the violation of his sacred trust. The age of puberty
      had been rashly fixed by the civilians at fourteen; 1361 but as
      the faculties of the mind ripen more slowly than those of the
      body, a curator was interposed to guard the fortunes of a Roman
      youth from his own inexperience and headstrong passions. Such a
      trustee had been first instituted by the praetor, to save a
      family from the blind havoc of a prodigal or madman; and the
      minor was compelled, by the laws, to solicit the same protection,
      to give validity to his acts till he accomplished the full period
      of twenty-five years. Women were condemned to the perpetual
      tutelage of parents, husbands, or guardians; a sex created to
      please and obey was never supposed to have attained the age of
      reason and experience. Such, at least, was the stern and haughty
      spirit of the ancient law, which had been insensibly mollified
      before the time of Justinian.

      fixed the age of puberty at twelve or fourteen years.” It was not

      II. The original right of property can only be justified by the
      accident or merit of prior occupancy; and on this foundation it
      is wisely established by the philosophy of the civilians. 137 The
      savage who hollows a tree, inserts a sharp stone into a wooden
      handle, or applies a string to an elastic branch, becomes in a
      state of nature the just proprietor of the canoe, the bow, or the
      hatchet. The materials were common to all, the new form, the
      produce of his time and simple industry, belongs solely to
      himself. His hungry brethren cannot, without a sense of their own
      injustice, extort from the hunter the game of the forest
      overtaken or slain by his personal strength and dexterity. If his
      provident care preserves and multiplies the tame animals, whose
      nature is tractable to the arts of education, he acquires a
      perpetual title to the use and service of their numerous progeny,
      which derives its existence from him alone. If he encloses and
      cultivates a field for their sustenance and his own, a barren
      waste is converted into a fertile soil; the seed, the manure, the
      labor, create a new value, and the rewards of harvest are
      painfully earned by the fatigues of the revolving year. In the
      successive states of society, the hunter, the shepherd, the
      husbandman, may defend their possessions by two reasons which
      forcibly appeal to the feelings of the human mind: that whatever
      they enjoy is the fruit of their own industry; and that every man
      who envies their felicity, may purchase similar acquisitions by
      the exercise of similar diligence. Such, in truth, may be the
      freedom and plenty of a small colony cast on a fruitful island.
      But the colony multiplies, while the space still continues the
      same; the common rights, the equal inheritance of mankind. are
      engrossed by the bold and crafty; each field and forest is
      circumscribed by the landmarks of a jealous master; and it is the
      peculiar praise of the Roman jurisprudence, that i asserts the
      claim of the first occupant to the wild animals of the earth, the
      air, and the waters. In the progress from primitive equity to
      final injustice, the steps are silent, the shades are almost
      imperceptible, and the absolute monopoly is guarded by positive
      laws and artificial reason. The active, insatiate principle of
      self-love can alone supply the arts of life and the wages of
      industry; and as soon as civil government and exclusive property
      have been introduced, they become necessary to the existence of
      the human race. Except in the singular institutions of Sparta,
      the wisest legislators have disapproved an agrarian law as a
      false and dangerous innovation. Among the Romans, the enormous
      disproportion of wealth surmounted the ideal restraints of a
      doubtful tradition, and an obsolete statute; a tradition that the
      poorest follower of Romulus had been endowed with the perpetual
      inheritance of two jugera; 138 a statute which confined the
      richest citizen to the measure of five hundred jugera, or three
      hundred and twelve acres of land. The original territory of Rome
      consisted only of some miles of wood and meadow along the banks
      of the Tyber; and domestic exchange could add nothing to the
      national stock. But the goods of an alien or enemy were lawfully
      exposed to the first hostile occupier; the city was enriched by
      the profitable trade of war; and the blood of her sons was the
      only price that was paid for the Volscian sheep, the slaves of
      Briton, or the gems and gold of Asiatic kingdoms. In the language
      of ancient jurisprudence, which was corrupted and forgotten
      before the age of Justinian, these spoils were distinguished by
      the name of manceps or manicipium, taken with the hand; and
      whenever they were sold or emancipated, the purchaser required
      some assurance that they had been the property of an enemy, and
      not of a fellow-citizen. 139 A citizen could only forfeit his
      rights by apparent dereliction, and such dereliction of a
      valuable interest could not easily be presumed. Yet, according to
      the Twelve Tables, a prescription of one year for movables, and
      of two years for immovables, abolished the claim of the ancient
      master, if the actual possessor had acquired them by a fair
      transaction from the person whom he believed to be the lawful
      proprietor. 140 Such conscientious injustice, without any mixture
      of fraud or force could seldom injure the members of a small
      republic; but the various periods of three, of ten, or of twenty
      years, determined by Justinian, are more suitable to the latitude
      of a great empire. It is only in the term of prescription that
      the distinction of real and personal fortune has been remarked by
      the civilians; and their general idea of property is that of
      simple, uniform, and absolute dominion. The subordinate
      exceptions of use, of usufruct, 141 of servitude, 142 imposed for
      the benefit of a neighbor on lands and houses, are abundantly
      explained by the professors of jurisprudence. The claims of
      property, as far as they are altered by the mixture, the
      division, or the transformation of substances, are investigated
      with metaphysical subtilty by the same civilians.

      obscurity of his views with regard to the res mancipi. The
      interpreters, who preceded him, are not agreed on this point, one
      of the most difficult in the ancient Roman law. The conclusions
      of Hume, of which the author here speaks, are grounded on false
      assumptions. Gibbon had conceived very inaccurate notions of
      Property among the Romans, and those of many authors in the
      present day are not less erroneous. We think it right, in this
      place, to develop the system of property among the Romans, as the
      result of the study of the extant original authorities on the
      ancient law, and as it has been demonstrated, recognized, and
      adopted by the most learned expositors of the Roman law. Besides
      the authorities formerly known, such as the Fragments of Ulpian,
      t. xix. and t. i. 16. Theoph. Paraph. i. 5, 4, may be consulted
      the Institutes of Gaius, i. 54, and ii. 40, et seq. The Roman
      laws protected all property acquired in a lawful manner. They
      imposed on those who had invaded it, the obligation of making
      restitution and reparation of all damage caused by that invasion;
      they punished it moreover, in many cases, by a pecuniary fine.
      But they did not always grant a recovery against the third
      person, who had become bona fide possessed of the property. He
      who had obtained possession of a thing belonging to another,
      knowing nothing of the prior rights of that person, maintained
      the possession. The law had expressly determined those cases, in
      which it permitted property to be reclaimed from an innocent
      possessor. In these cases possession had the characters of
      absolute proprietorship, called mancipium, jus Quiritium. To
      possess this right, it was not sufficient to have entered into
      possession of the thing in any manner; the acquisition was bound
      to have that character of publicity, which was given by the
      observation of solemn forms, prescribed by the laws, or the
      uninterrupted exercise of proprietorship during a certain time:
      the Roman citizen alone could acquire this proprietorship. Every
      other kind of possession, which might be named imperfect
      proprietorship, was called “in bonis habere.” It was not till
      after the time of Cicero that the general name of Dominium was
      given to all proprietorship. It was then the publicity which
      constituted the distinctive character of absolute dominion. This
      publicity was grounded on the mode of acquisition, which the
      moderns have called Civil, (Modi adquirendi Civiles.) These modes
      of acquisition were, 1. Mancipium or mancipatio, which was
      nothing but the solemn delivering over of the thing in the
      presence of a determinate number of witnesses and a public
      officer; it was from this probably that proprietorship was named,
      2. In jure cessio, which was a solemn delivering over before the
      praetor. 3. Adjudicatio, made by a judge, in a case of partition.
      4. Lex, which comprehended modes of acquiring in particular cases
      determined by law; probably the law of the xii. tables; for
      instance, the sub corona emptio and the legatum. 5. Usna, called
      afterwards usacapio, and by the moderns prescription. This was
      only a year for movables; two years for things not movable. Its
      primary object was altogether different from that of prescription
      in the present day. It was originally introduced in order to
      transform the simple possession of a thing (in bonis habere) into
      Roman proprietorship. The public and uninterrupted possession of
      a thing, enjoyed for the space of one or two years, was
      sufficient to make known to the inhabitants of the city of Rome
      to whom the thing belonged. This last mode of acquisition
      completed the system of civil acquisitions. by legalizing. as it
      were, every other kind of acquisition which was not conferred,
      from the commencement, by the Jus Quiritium. V. Ulpian. Fragm. i.
      16. Gaius, ii. 14. We believe, according to Gaius, 43, that this
      usucaption was extended to the case where a thing had been
      acquired from a person not the real proprietor; and that
      according to the time prescribed, it gave to the possessor the
      Roman proprietorship. But this does not appear to have been the
      original design of this Institution. Caeterum etiam earum rerum
      usucapio nobis competit, quae non a domino nobis tradita fuerint,
      si modo eas bona fide acceperimus Gaius, l ii. 43. As to things
      of smaller value, or those which it was difficult to distinguish
      from each other, the solemnities of which we speak were not
      requisite to obtain legal proprietorship. In this case simple
      delivery was sufficient. In proportion to the aggrandizement of
      the Republic, this latter principle became more important from
      the increase of the commerce and wealth of the state. It was
      necessary to know what were those things of which absolute
      property might be acquired by simple delivery, and what, on the
      contrary, those, the acquisition of which must be sanctioned by
      these solemnities. This question was necessarily to be decided by
      a general rule; and it is this rule which establishes the
      distinction between res mancipi and nec mancipi, a distinction
      about which the opinions of modern civilians differ so much that
      there are above ten conflicting systems on the subject. The
      system which accords best with a sound interpretation of the
      Roman laws, is that proposed by M. Trekel of Hamburg, and still
      further developed by M. Hugo, who has extracted it in the
      Magazine of Civil Law, vol. ii. p. 7. This is the system now
      almost universally adopted. Res mancipi (by contraction for
      mancipii) were things of which the absolute property (Jus
      Quiritium) might be acquired only by the solemnities mentioned
      above, at least by that of mancipation, which was, without doubt,
      the most easy and the most usual. Gaius, ii. 25. As for other
      things, the acquisition of which was not subject to these forms,
      in order to confer absolute right, they were called res nec
      mancipi. See Ulpian, Fragm. xix. 1. 3, 7. Ulpian and Varro
      enumerate the different kinds of res mancipi. Their enumerations
      do not quite agree; and various methods of reconciling them have
      been attempted. The authority of Ulpian, however, who wrote as a
      civilian, ought to have the greater weight on this subject. But
      why are these things alone res mancipi? This is one of the
      questions which have been most frequently agitated, and on which
      the opinions of civilians are most divided. M. Hugo has resolved
      it in the most natural and satisfactory manner. “All things which
      were easily known individually, which were of great value, with
      which the Romans were acquainted, and which they highly
      appreciated, were res mancipi. Of old mancipation or some other
      solemn form was required for the acquisition of these things, an
      account of their importance. Mancipation served to prove their
      acquisition, because they were easily distinguished one from the
      other.” On this great historical discussion consult the Magazine
      of Civil Law by M. Hugo, vol. ii. p. 37, 38; the dissertation of
      M. J. M. Zachariae, de Rebus Mancipi et nec Mancipi Conjecturae,
      p. 11. Lipsiae, 1807; the History of Civil Law by M. Hugo; and my
      Institutiones Juris Romani Privati p. 108, 110. As a general
      rule, it may be said that all things are res nec mancipi; the res
      mancipi are the exception to this principle. The praetors changed
      the system of property by allowing a person, who had a thing in
      bonis, the right to recover before the prescribed term of
      usucaption had conferred absolute proprietorship. (Pauliana in
      rem actio.) Justinian went still further, in times when there was
      no longer any distinction between a Roman citizen and a stranger.
      He granted the right of recovering all things which had been
      acquired, whether by what were called civil or natural modes of
      acquisition, Cod. l. vii. t. 25, 31. And he so altered the theory
      of Gaius in his Institutes, ii. 1, that no trace remains of the
      doctrine taught by that civilian.—W.]

      The personal title of the first proprietor must be determined by
      his death: but the possession, without any appearance of change,
      is peaceably continued in his children, the associates of his
      toil, and the partners of his wealth. This natural inheritance
      has been protected by the legislators of every climate and age,
      and the father is encouraged to persevere in slow and distant
      improvements, by the tender hope, that a long posterity will
      enjoy the fruits of his labor. The principle of hereditary
      succession is universal; but the order has been variously
      established by convenience or caprice, by the spirit of national
      institutions, or by some partial example which was originally
      decided by fraud or violence. The jurisprudence of the Romans
      appear to have deviated from the inequality of nature much less
      than the Jewish, 143 the Athenian, 144 or the English
      institutions. 145 On the death of a citizen, all his descendants,
      unless they were already freed from his paternal power, were
      called to the inheritance of his possessions. The insolent
      prerogative of primogeniture was unknown; the two sexes were
      placed on a just level; all the sons and daughters were entitled
      to an equal portion of the patrimonial estate; and if any of the
      sons had been intercepted by a premature death, his person was
      represented, and his share was divided, by his surviving
      children. On the failure of the direct line, the right of
      succession must diverge to the collateral branches. The degrees
      of kindred 146 are numbered by the civilians, ascending from the
      last possessor to a common parent, and descending from the common
      parent to the next heir: my father stands in the first degree, my
      brother in the second, his children in the third, and the
      remainder of the series may be conceived by a fancy, or pictured
      in a genealogical table. In this computation, a distinction was
      made, essential to the laws and even the constitution of Rome;
      the agnats, or persons connected by a line of males, were called,
      as they stood in the nearest degree, to an equal partition; but a
      female was incapable of transmitting any legal claims; and the
      cognats of every rank, without excepting the dear relation of a
      mother and a son, were disinherited by the Twelve Tables, as
      strangers and aliens. Among the Romans agens or lineage was
      united by a common name and domestic rites; the various cognomens
      or surnames of Scipio, or Marcellus, distinguished from each
      other the subordinate branches or families of the Cornelian or
      Claudian race: the default of the agnats, of the same surname,
      was supplied by the larger denomination of gentiles; and the
      vigilance of the laws maintained, in the same name, the perpetual
      descent of religion and property. A similar principle dictated
      the Voconian law, 147 which abolished the right of female
      inheritance. As long as virgins were given or sold in marriage,
      the adoption of the wife extinguished the hopes of the daughter.
      But the equal succession of independent matrons supported their
      pride and luxury, and might transport into a foreign house the
      riches of their fathers.

      While the maxims of Cato 148 were revered, they tended to
      perpetuate in each family a just and virtuous mediocrity: till
      female blandishments insensibly triumphed; and every salutary
      restraint was lost in the dissolute greatness of the republic.
      The rigor of the decemvirs was tempered by the equity of the
      praetors. Their edicts restored and emancipated posthumous
      children to the rights of nature; and upon the failure of the
      agnats, they preferred the blood of the cognats to the name of
      the gentiles whose title and character were insensibly covered
      with oblivion. The reciprocal inheritance of mothers and sons was
      established in the Tertullian and Orphitian decrees by the
      humanity of the senate. A new and more impartial order was
      introduced by the Novels of Justinian, who affected to revive the
      jurisprudence of the Twelve Tables. The lines of masculine and
      female kindred were confounded: the descending, ascending, and
      collateral series was accurately defined; and each degree,
      according to the proximity of blood and affection, succeeded to
      the vacant possessions of a Roman citizen. 149

      The order of succession is regulated by nature, or at least by
      the general and permanent reason of the lawgiver: but this order
      is frequently violated by the arbitrary and partial wills, which
      prolong the dominion of the testator beyond the grave. 150 In the
      simple state of society, this last use or abuse of the right of
      property is seldom indulged: it was introduced at Athens by the
      laws of Solon; and the private testaments of the father of a
      family are authorized by the Twelve Tables. Before the time of
      the decemvirs, 151 a Roman citizen exposed his wishes and motives
      to the assembly of the thirty curiae or parishes, and the general
      law of inheritance was suspended by an occasional act of the
      legislature. After the permission of the decemvirs, each private
      lawgiver promulgated his verbal or written testament in the
      presence of five citizens, who represented the five classes of
      the Roman people; a sixth witness attested their concurrence; a
      seventh weighed the copper money, which was paid by an imaginary
      purchaser; and the estate was emancipated by a fictitious sale
      and immediate release. This singular ceremony, 152 which excited
      the wonder of the Greeks, was still practised in the age of
      Severus; but the praetors had already approved a more simple
      testament, for which they required the seals and signatures of
      seven witnesses, free from all legal exception, and purposely
      summoned for the execution of that important act. A domestic
      monarch, who reigned over the lives and fortunes of his children,
      might distribute their respective shares according to the degrees
      of their merit or his affection; his arbitrary displeasure
      chastised an unworthy son by the loss of his inheritance, and the
      mortifying preference of a stranger. But the experience of
      unnatural parents recommended some limitations of their
      testamentary powers. A son, or, by the laws of Justinian, even a
      daughter, could no longer be disinherited by their silence: they
      were compelled to name the criminal, and to specify the offence;
      and the justice of the emperor enumerated the sole causes that
      could justify such a violation of the first principles of nature
      and society. 153 Unless a legitimate portion, a fourth part, had
      been reserved for the children, they were entitled to institute
      an action or complaint of inofficious testament; to suppose that
      their father’s understanding was impaired by sickness or age; and
      respectfully to appeal from his rigorous sentence to the
      deliberate wisdom of the magistrate. In the Roman jurisprudence,
      an essential distinction was admitted between the inheritance and
      the legacies. The heirs who succeeded to the entire unity, or to
      any of the twelve fractions of the substance of the testator,
      represented his civil and religious character, asserted his
      rights, fulfilled his obligations, and discharged the gifts of
      friendship or liberality, which his last will had bequeathed
      under the name of legacies. But as the imprudence or prodigality
      of a dying man might exhaust the inheritance, and leave only risk
      and labor to his successor, he was empowered to retain the
      Falcidian portion; to deduct, before the payment of the legacies,
      a clear fourth for his own emolument. A reasonable time was
      allowed to examine the proportion between the debts and the
      estate, to decide whether he should accept or refuse the
      testament; and if he used the benefit of an inventory, the
      demands of the creditors could not exceed the valuation of the
      effects. The last will of a citizen might be altered during his
      life, or rescinded after his death: the persons whom he named
      might die before him, or reject the inheritance, or be exposed to
      some legal disqualification. In the contemplation of these
      events, he was permitted to substitute second and third heirs, to
      replace each other according to the order of the testament; and
      the incapacity of a madman or an infant to bequeath his property
      might be supplied by a similar substitution. 154 But the power of
      the testator expired with the acceptance of the testament: each
      Roman of mature age and discretion acquired the absolute dominion
      of his inheritance, and the simplicity of the civil law was never
      clouded by the long and intricate entails which confine the
      happiness and freedom of unborn generations.

      577-604.) They were stretched to the fourth degree by an abuse of
      the clixth Novel; a partial, perplexed, declamatory law.]

      Conquest and the formalities of law established the use of
      codicils. If a Roman was surprised by death in a remote province
      of the empire, he addressed a short epistle to his legitimate or
      testamentary heir; who fulfilled with honor, or neglected with
      impunity, this last request, which the judges before the age of
      Augustus were not authorized to enforce. A codicil might be
      expressed in any mode, or in any language; but the subscription
      of five witnesses must declare that it was the genuine
      composition of the author. His intention, however laudable, was
      sometimes illegal; and the invention of fidei-commissa, or
      trusts, arose form the struggle between natural justice and
      positive jurisprudence. A stranger of Greece or Africa might be
      the friend or benefactor of a childless Roman, but none, except a
      fellow-citizen, could act as his heir. The Voconian law, which
      abolished female succession, restrained the legacy or inheritance
      of a woman to the sum of one hundred thousand sesterces; 155 and
      an only daughter was condemned almost as an alien in her father’s
      house. The zeal of friendship, and parental affection, suggested
      a liberal artifice: a qualified citizen was named in the
      testament, with a prayer or injunction that he would restore the
      inheritance to the person for whom it was truly intended. Various
      was the conduct of the trustees in this painful situation: they
      had sworn to observe the laws of their country, but honor
      prompted them to violate their oath; and if they preferred their
      interest under the mask of patriotism, they forfeited the esteem
      of every virtuous mind. The declaration of Augustus relieved
      their doubts, gave a legal sanction to confidential testaments
      and codicils, and gently unravelled the forms and restraints of
      the republican jurisprudence. 156 But as the new practice of
      trusts degenerated into some abuse, the trustee was enabled, by
      the Trebellian and Pegasian decrees, to reserve one fourth of the
      estate, or to transfer on the head of the real heir all the debts
      and actions of the succession. The interpretation of testaments
      was strict and literal; but the language of trusts and codicils
      was delivered from the minute and technical accuracy of the
      civilians. 157

      obligations are ratified by law, the interested party may compel
      the performance by a judicial action. On this principle, the
      civilians of every country have erected a similar jurisprudence,

      Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence.—Part VII.

      1. The goddess of faith (of human and social faith) was
      worshipped, not only in her temples, but in the lives of the
      Romans; and if that nation was deficient in the more amiable
      qualities of benevolence and generosity, they astonished the
      Greeks by their sincere and simple performance of the most
      burdensome engagements. 159 Yet among the same people, according
      to the rigid maxims of the patricians and decemvirs, a naked
      pact, a promise, or even an oath, did not create any civil
      obligation, unless it was confirmed by the legal form of a
      stipulation. Whatever might be the etymology of the Latin word,
      it conveyed the idea of a firm and irrevocable contract, which
      was always expressed in the mode of a question and answer. Do you
      promise to pay me one hundred pieces of gold? was the solemn
      interrogation of Seius. I do promise, was the reply of
      Sempronius. The friends of Sempronius, who answered for his
      ability and inclination, might be separately sued at the option
      of Seius; and the benefit of partition, or order of reciprocal
      actions, insensibly deviated from the strict theory of
      stipulation. The most cautious and deliberate consent was justly
      required to sustain the validity of a gratuitous promise; and the
      citizen who might have obtained a legal security, incurred the
      suspicion of fraud, and paid the forfeit of his neglect. But the
      ingenuity of the civilians successfully labored to convert simple
      engagements into the form of solemn stipulations. The praetors,
      as the guardians of social faith, admitted every rational
      evidence of a voluntary and deliberate act, which in their
      tribunal produced an equitable obligation, and for which they
      gave an action and a remedy. 160

      159 (return) [ How much is the cool, rational evidence of
      Polybius (l. vi. p. 693, l. xxxi. p. 1459, 1460) superior to
      vague, indiscriminate applause—omnium maxime et praecipue fidem
      coluit, (A. Gellius, xx. l.)]

      160 (return) [ The Jus Praetorium de Pactis et Transactionibus is
      a separate and satisfactory treatise of Gerard Noodt, (Opp. tom.
      i. p. 483—564.) And I will here observe, that the universities of
      Holland and Brandenburg, in the beginning of the present century,
      appear to have studied the civil law on the most just and liberal
      principles. * Note: Simple agreements (pacta) formed as valid an
      obligation as a solemn contract. Only an action, or the right to
      a direct judicial prosecution, was not permitted in every case of
      compact. In all other respects, the judge was bound to maintain
      an agreement made by pactum. The stipulation was a form common to
      every kind of agreement, by which the right of action was given
      to this.—W.]

      2. The obligations of the second class, as they were contracted
      by the delivery of a thing, are marked by the civilians with the
      epithet of real. 161 A grateful return is due to the author of a
      benefit; and whoever is intrusted with the property of another,
      has bound himself to the sacred duty of restitution. In the case
      of a friendly loan, the merit of generosity is on the side of the
      lender only; in a deposit, on the side of the receiver; but in a
      pledge, and the rest of the selfish commerce of ordinary life,
      the benefit is compensated by an equivalent, and the obligation
      to restore is variously modified by the nature of the
      transaction. The Latin language very happily expresses the
      fundamental difference between the commodatum and the mutuum,
      which our poverty is reduced to confound under the vague and
      common appellation of a loan. In the former, the borrower was
      obliged to restore the same individual thing with which he had
      been accommodated for the temporary supply of his wants; in the
      latter, it was destined for his use and consumption, and he
      discharged this mutual engagement, by substituting the same
      specific value according to a just estimation of number, of
      weight, and of measure. In the contract of sale, the absolute
      dominion is transferred to the purchaser, and he repays the
      benefit with an adequate sum of gold or silver, the price and
      universal standard of all earthly possessions. The obligation of
      another contract, that of location, is of a more complicated
      kind. Lands or houses, labor or talents, may be hired for a
      definite term; at the expiration of the time, the thing itself
      must be restored to the owner, with an additional reward for the
      beneficial occupation and employment. In these lucrative
      contracts, to which may be added those of partnership and
      commissions, the civilians sometimes imagine the delivery of the
      object, and sometimes presume the consent of the parties. The
      substantial pledge has been refined into the invisible rights of
      a mortgage or hypotheca; and the agreement of sale, for a certain
      price, imputes, from that moment, the chances of gain or loss to
      the account of the purchaser. It may be fairly supposed, that
      every man will obey the dictates of his interest; and if he
      accepts the benefit, he is obliged to sustain the expense, of the
      transaction. In this boundless subject, the historian will
      observe the location of land and money, the rent of the one and
      the interest of the other, as they materially affect the
      prosperity of agriculture and commerce. The landlord was often
      obliged to advance the stock and instruments of husbandry, and to
      content himself with a partition of the fruits. If the feeble
      tenant was oppressed by accident, contagion, or hostile violence,
      he claimed a proportionable relief from the equity of the laws:
      five years were the customary term, and no solid or costly
      improvements could be expected from a farmer, who, at each moment
      might be ejected by the sale of the estate. 162 Usury, 163 the
      inveterate grievance of the city, had been discouraged by the
      Twelve Tables, 164 and abolished by the clamors of the people. It
      was revived by their wants and idleness, tolerated by the
      discretion of the praetors, and finally determined by the Code of
      Justinian. Persons of illustrious rank were confined to the
      moderate profit of four per cent.; six was pronounced to be the
      ordinary and legal standard of interest; eight was allowed for
      the convenience of manufactures and merchants; twelve was granted
      to nautical insurance, which the wiser ancients had not attempted
      to define; but, except in this perilous adventure, the practice
      of exorbitant usury was severely restrained. 165 The most simple
      interest was condemned by the clergy of the East and West; 166
      but the sense of mutual benefit, which had triumphed over the law
      of the republic, has resisted with equal firmness the decrees of
      the church, and even the prejudices of mankind. 167

      161 (return) [ The nice and various subject of contracts by
      consent is spread over four books (xvii.—xx.) of the Pandects,

      English student. * Note: This is erroneously called “benefits.”

      law; but in France all leases of land were determined in nine
      years. This limitation was removed only in the year 1775,
      (Encyclopedie Methodique, tom. i. de la Jurisprudence, p. 668,

      3. Nature and society impose the strict obligation of repairing
      an injury; and the sufferer by private injustice acquires a
      personal right and a legitimate action. If the property of
      another be intrusted to our care, the requisite degree of care
      may rise and fall according to the benefit which we derive from
      such temporary possession; we are seldom made responsible for
      inevitable accident, but the consequences of a voluntary fault
      must always be imputed to the author. 168 A Roman pursued and
      recovered his stolen goods by a civil action of theft; they might
      pass through a succession of pure and innocent hands, but nothing
      less than a prescription of thirty years could extinguish his
      original claim. They were restored by the sentence of the
      praetor, and the injury was compensated by double, or threefold,
      or even quadruple damages, as the deed had been perpetrated by
      secret fraud or open rapine, as the robber had been surprised in
      the fact, or detected by a subsequent research. The Aquilian law
      169 defended the living property of a citizen, his slaves and
      cattle, from the stroke of malice or negligence: the highest
      price was allowed that could be ascribed to the domestic animal
      at any moment of the year preceding his death; a similar latitude
      of thirty days was granted on the destruction of any other
      valuable effects. A personal injury is blunted or sharpened by
      the manners of the times and the sensibility of the individual:
      the pain or the disgrace of a word or blow cannot easily be
      appreciated by a pecuniary equivalent. The rude jurisprudence of
      the decemvirs had confounded all hasty insults, which did not
      amount to the fracture of a limb, by condemning the aggressor to
      the common penalty of twenty-five asses. But the same
      denomination of money was reduced, in three centuries, from a
      pound to the weight of half an ounce: and the insolence of a
      wealthy Roman indulged himself in the cheap amusement of breaking
      and satisfying the law of the twelve tables. Veratius ran through
      the streets striking on the face the inoffensive passengers, and
      his attendant purse-bearer immediately silenced their clamors by
      the legal tender of twenty-five pieces of copper, about the value
      of one shilling. 170 The equity of the praetors examined and
      estimated the distinct merits of each particular complaint. In
      the adjudication of civil damages, the magistrate assumed a right
      to consider the various circumstances of time and place, of age
      and dignity, which may aggravate the shame and sufferings of the
      injured person; but if he admitted the idea of a fine, a
      punishment, an example, he invaded the province, though, perhaps,
      he supplied the defects, of the criminal law.

      The execution of the Alban dictator, who was dismembered by eight
      horses, is represented by Livy as the first and the fast instance
      of Roman cruelty in the punishment of the most atrocious crimes.
      171 But this act of justice, or revenge, was inflicted on a
      foreign enemy in the heat of victory, and at the command of a
      single man. The twelve tables afford a more decisive proof of the
      national spirit, since they were framed by the wisest of the
      senate, and accepted by the free voices of the people; yet these
      laws, like the statutes of Draco, 172 are written in characters
      of blood. 173 They approve the inhuman and unequal principle of
      retaliation; and the forfeit of an eye for an eye, a tooth for a
      tooth, a limb for a limb, is rigorously exacted, unless the
      offender can redeem his pardon by a fine of three hundred pounds
      of copper. The decemvirs distributed with much liberality the
      slighter chastisements of flagellation and servitude; and nine
      crimes of a very different complexion are adjudged worthy of
      death.

      1. Any act of treason against the state, or of correspondence
      with the public enemy. The mode of execution was painful and
      ignominious: the head of the degenerate Roman was shrouded in a
      veil, his hands were tied behind his back, and after he had been
      scourged by the lictor, he was suspended in the midst of the
      forum on a cross, or inauspicious tree.

      2. Nocturnal meetings in the city; whatever might be the
      pretence, of pleasure, or religion, or the public good.

      3. The murder of a citizen; for which the common feelings of
      mankind demand the blood of the murderer. Poison is still more
      odious than the sword or dagger; and we are surprised to
      discover, in two flagitious events, how early such subtle
      wickedness had infected the simplicity of the republic, and the
      chaste virtues of the Roman matrons. 174 The parricide, who
      violated the duties of nature and gratitude, was cast into the
      river or the sea, enclosed in a sack; and a cock, a viper, a dog,
      and a monkey, were successively added, as the most suitable
      companions. 175 Italy produces no monkeys; but the want could
      never be felt, till the middle of the sixth century first
      revealed the guilt of a parricide. 176

      4. The malice of an incendiary. After the previous ceremony of
      whipping, he himself was delivered to the flames; and in this
      example alone our reason is tempted to applaud the justice of
      retaliation.

      5. Judicial perjury. The corrupt or malicious witness was thrown
      headlong from the Tarpeian rock, to expiate his falsehood, which
      was rendered still more fatal by the severity of the penal laws,
      and the deficiency of written evidence.

      6. The corruption of a judge, who accepted bribes to pronounce an
      iniquitous sentence.

      7. Libels and satires, whose rude strains sometimes disturbed the
      peace of an illiterate city. The author was beaten with clubs, a
      worthy chastisement, but it is not certain that he was left to
      expire under the blows of the executioner. 177

      8. The nocturnal mischief of damaging or destroying a neighbor’s
      corn. The criminal was suspended as a grateful victim to Ceres.
      But the sylvan deities were less implacable, and the extirpation
      of a more valuable tree was compensated by the moderate fine of
      twenty-five pounds of copper.

      9. Magical incantations; which had power, in the opinion of the
      Latin shepherds, to exhaust the strength of an enemy, to
      extinguish his life, and to remove from their seats his
      deep-rooted plantations.

      The cruelty of the twelve tables against insolvent debtors still
      remains to be told; and I shall dare to prefer the literal sense
      of antiquity to the specious refinements of modern criticism. 178
      1781 After the judicial proof or confession of the debt, thirty
      days of grace were allowed before a Roman was delivered into the
      power of his fellow-citizen. In this private prison, twelve
      ounces of rice were his daily food; he might be bound with a
      chain of fifteen pounds weight; and his misery was thrice exposed
      in the market place, to solicit the compassion of his friends and
      countrymen. At the expiration of sixty days, the debt was
      discharged by the loss of liberty or life; the insolvent debtor
      was either put to death, or sold in foreign slavery beyond the
      Tyber: but, if several creditors were alike obstinate and
      unrelenting, they might legally dismember his body, and satiate
      their revenge by this horrid partition. The advocates for this
      savage law have insisted, that it must strongly operate in
      deterring idleness and fraud from contracting debts which they
      were unable to discharge; but experience would dissipate this
      salutary terror, by proving that no creditor could be found to
      exact this unprofitable penalty of life or limb. As the manners
      of Rome were insensibly polished, the criminal code of the
      decemvirs was abolished by the humanity of accusers, witnesses,
      and judges; and impunity became the consequence of immoderate
      rigor. The Porcian and Valerian laws prohibited the magistrates
      from inflicting on a free citizen any capital, or even corporal,
      punishment; and the obsolete statutes of blood were artfully, and
      perhaps truly, ascribed to the spirit, not of patrician, but of
      regal, tyranny.

      In the absence of penal laws, and the insufficiency of civil
      actions, the peace and justice of the city were imperfectly
      maintained by the private jurisdiction of the citizens. The
      malefactors who replenish our jails are the outcasts of society,
      and the crimes for which they suffer may be commonly ascribed to
      ignorance, poverty, and brutal appetite. For the perpetration of
      similar enormities, a vile plebeian might claim and abuse the
      sacred character of a member of the republic: but, on the proof
      or suspicion of guilt, the slave, or the stranger, was nailed to
      a cross; and this strict and summary justice might be exercised
      without restraint over the greatest part of the populace of Rome.

      Each family contained a domestic tribunal, which was not
      confined, like that of the praetor, to the cognizance of external
      actions: virtuous principles and habits were inculcated by the
      discipline of education; and the Roman father was accountable to
      the state for the manners of his children, since he disposed,
      without appeal, of their life, their liberty, and their
      inheritance. In some pressing emergencies, the citizen was
      authorized to avenge his private or public wrongs. The consent of
      the Jewish, the Athenian, and the Roman laws approved the
      slaughter of the nocturnal thief; though in open daylight a
      robber could not be slain without some previous evidence of
      danger and complaint. Whoever surprised an adulterer in his
      nuptial bed might freely exercise his revenge; 179 the most
      bloody and wanton outrage was excused by the provocation; 180 nor
      was it before the reign of Augustus that the husband was reduced
      to weigh the rank of the offender, or that the parent was
      condemned to sacrifice his daughter with her guilty seducer.
      After the expulsion of the kings, the ambitious Roman, who should
      dare to assume their title or imitate their tyranny, was devoted
      to the infernal gods: each of his fellow-citizens was armed with
      the sword of justice; and the act of Brutus, however repugnant to
      gratitude or prudence, had been already sanctified by the
      judgment of his country. 181 The barbarous practice of wearing
      arms in the midst of peace, 182 and the bloody maxims of honor,
      were unknown to the Romans; and, during the two purest ages, from
      the establishment of equal freedom to the end of the Punic wars,
      the city was never disturbed by sedition, and rarely polluted
      with atrocious crimes. The failure of penal laws was more
      sensibly felt, when every vice was inflamed by faction at home
      and dominion abroad. In the time of Cicero, each private citizen
      enjoyed the privilege of anarchy; each minister of the republic
      was exalted to the temptations of regal power, and their virtues
      are entitled to the warmest praise, as the spontaneous fruits of
      nature or philosophy. After a triennial indulgence of lust,
      rapine, and cruelty, Verres, the tyrant of Sicily, could only be
      sued for the pecuniary restitution of three hundred thousand
      pounds sterling; and such was the temper of the laws, the judges,
      and perhaps the accuser himself, 183 that, on refunding a
      thirteenth part of his plunder, Verres could retire to an easy
      and luxurious exile. 184

      till the second triumvirate, when he was proscribed by the taste

      The first imperfect attempt to restore the proportion of crimes
      and punishments was made by the dictator Sylla, who, in the midst
      of his sanguinary triumph, aspired to restrain the license,
      rather than to oppress the liberty, of the Romans. He gloried in
      the arbitrary proscription of four thousand seven hundred
      citizens. 185 But, in the character of a legislator, he respected
      the prejudices of the times; and, instead of pronouncing a
      sentence of death against the robber or assassin, the general who
      betrayed an army, or the magistrate who ruined a province, Sylla
      was content to aggravate the pecuniary damages by the penalty of
      exile, or, in more constitutional language, by the interdiction
      of fire and water. The Cornelian, and afterwards the Pompeian and
      Julian, laws introduced a new system of criminal jurisprudence;
      186 and the emperors, from Augustus to Justinian, disguised their
      increasing rigor under the names of the original authors. But the
      invention and frequent use of extraordinary pains proceeded from
      the desire to extend and conceal the progress of despotism. In
      the condemnation of illustrious Romans, the senate was always
      prepared to confound, at the will of their masters, the judicial
      and legislative powers. It was the duty of the governors to
      maintain the peace of their province, by the arbitrary and rigid
      administration of justice; the freedom of the city evaporated in
      the extent of empire, and the Spanish malefactor, who claimed the
      privilege of a Roman, was elevated by the command of Galba on a
      fairer and more lofty cross. 187 Occasional rescripts issued from
      the throne to decide the questions which, by their novelty or
      importance, appeared to surpass the authority and discernment of
      a proconsul. Transportation and beheading were reserved for
      honorable persons; meaner criminals were either hanged, or burnt,
      or buried in the mines, or exposed to the wild beasts of the
      amphitheatre. Armed robbers were pursued and extirpated as the
      enemies of society; the driving away horses or cattle was made a
      capital offence; 188 but simple theft was uniformly considered as
      a mere civil and private injury. The degrees of guilt, and the
      modes of punishment, were too often determined by the discretion
      of the rulers, and the subject was left in ignorance of the legal
      danger which he might incur by every action of his life.

      188 (return) [ The abactores or abigeatores, who drove one horse,
      or two mares or oxen, or five hogs, or ten goats, were subject to

      497, 498.) Hadrian, (ad Concil. Baeticae,) most severe where the
      offence was most frequent, condemns the criminals, ad gladium,
      ludi damnationem, (Ulpian, de Officio Proconsulis, l. viii. in
      Collatione Legum Mosaic. et Rom. tit. xi p. 235.)]

      A sin, a vice, a crime, are the objects of theology, ethics, and
      jurisprudence. Whenever their judgments agree, they corroborate
      each other; but, as often as they differ, a prudent legislator
      appreciates the guilt and punishment according to the measure of
      social injury. On this principle, the most daring attack on the
      life and property of a private citizen is judged less atrocious
      than the crime of treason or rebellion, which invades the majesty
      of the republic: the obsequious civilians unanimously pronounced,
      that the republic is contained in the person of its chief; and
      the edge of the Julian law was sharpened by the incessant
      diligence of the emperors. The licentious commerce of the sexes
      may be tolerated as an impulse of nature, or forbidden as a
      source of disorder and corruption; but the fame, the fortunes,
      the family of the husband, are seriously injured by the adultery
      of the wife. The wisdom of Augustus, after curbing the freedom of
      revenge, applied to this domestic offence the animadversion of
      the laws: and the guilty parties, after the payment of heavy
      forfeitures and fines, were condemned to long or perpetual exile
      in two separate islands. 189 Religion pronounces an equal censure
      against the infidelity of the husband; but, as it is not
      accompanied by the same civil effects, the wife was never
      permitted to vindicate her wrongs; 190 and the distinction of
      simple or double adultery, so familiar and so important in the
      canon law, is unknown to the jurisprudence of the Code and the
      Pandects. I touch with reluctance, and despatch with impatience,
      a more odious vice, of which modesty rejects the name, and nature
      abominates the idea. The primitive Romans were infected by the
      example of the Etruscans 191 and Greeks: 192 and in the mad abuse
      of prosperity and power, every pleasure that is innocent was
      deemed insipid; and the Scatinian law, 193 which had been
      extorted by an act of violence, was insensibly abolished by the
      lapse of time and the multitude of criminals. By this law, the
      rape, perhaps the seduction, of an ingenuous youth, was
      compensated, as a personal injury, by the poor damages of ten
      thousand sesterces, or fourscore pounds; the ravisher might be
      slain by the resistance or revenge of chastity; and I wish to
      believe, that at Rome, as in Athens, the voluntary and effeminate
      deserter of his sex was degraded from the honors and the rights
      of a citizen. 194 But the practice of vice was not discouraged by
      the severity of opinion: the indelible stain of manhood was
      confounded with the more venial transgressions of fornication and
      adultery, nor was the licentious lover exposed to the same
      dishonor which he impressed on the male or female partner of his
      guilt. From Catullus to Juvenal, 195 the poets accuse and
      celebrate the degeneracy of the times; and the reformation of
      manners was feebly attempted by the reason and authority of the
      civilians till the most virtuous of the Caesars proscribed the
      sin against nature as a crime against society. 196

      Chapter XLIV: Idea Of The Roman Jurisprudence.—Part VIII.

      A new spirit of legislation, respectable even in its error, arose
      in the empire with the religion of Constantine. 197 The laws of
      Moses were received as the divine original of justice, and the
      Christian princes adapted their penal statutes to the degrees of
      moral and religious turpitude. Adultery was first declared to be
      a capital offence: the frailty of the sexes was assimilated to
      poison or assassination, to sorcery or parricide; the same
      penalties were inflicted on the passive and active guilt of
      paederasty; and all criminals of free or servile condition were
      either drowned or beheaded, or cast alive into the avenging
      flames. The adulterers were spared by the common sympathy of
      mankind; but the lovers of their own sex were pursued by general
      and pious indignation: the impure manners of Greece still
      prevailed in the cities of Asia, and every vice was fomented by
      the celibacy of the monks and clergy. Justinian relaxed the
      punishment at least of female infidelity: the guilty spouse was
      only condemned to solitude and penance, and at the end of two
      years she might be recalled to the arms of a forgiving husband.
      But the same emperor declared himself the implacable enemy of
      unmanly lust, and the cruelty of his persecution can scarcely be
      excused by the purity of his motives. 198 In defiance of every
      principle of justice, he stretched to past as well as future
      offences the operations of his edicts, with the previous
      allowance of a short respite for confession and pardon. A painful
      death was inflicted by the amputation of the sinful instrument,
      or the insertion of sharp reeds into the pores and tubes of most
      exquisite sensibility; and Justinian defended the propriety of
      the execution, since the criminals would have lost their hands,
      had they been convicted of sacrilege. In this state of disgrace
      and agony, two bishops, Isaiah of Rhodes and Alexander of
      Diospolis, were dragged through the streets of Constantinople,
      while their brethren were admonished, by the voice of a crier, to
      observe this awful lesson, and not to pollute the sanctity of
      their character. Perhaps these prelates were innocent. A sentence
      of death and infamy was often founded on the slight and
      suspicious evidence of a child or a servant: the guilt of the
      green faction, of the rich, and of the enemies of Theodora, was
      presumed by the judges, and paederasty became the crime of those
      to whom no crime could be imputed. A French philosopher 199 has
      dared to remark that whatever is secret must be doubtful, and
      that our natural horror of vice may be abused as an engine of
      tyranny. But the favorable persuasion of the same writer, that a
      legislator may confide in the taste and reason of mankind, is
      impeached by the unwelcome discovery of the antiquity and extent
      of the disease. 200

      The free citizens of Athens and Rome enjoyed, in all criminal
      cases, the invaluable privilege of being tried by their country.
      201 1. The administration of justice is the most ancient office
      of a prince: it was exercised by the Roman kings, and abused by
      Tarquin; who alone, without law or council, pronounced his
      arbitrary judgments. The first consuls succeeded to this regal
      prerogative; but the sacred right of appeal soon abolished the
      jurisdiction of the magistrates, and all public causes were
      decided by the supreme tribunal of the people. But a wild
      democracy, superior to the forms, too often disdains the
      essential principles, of justice: the pride of despotism was
      envenomed by plebeian envy, and the heroes of Athens might
      sometimes applaud the happiness of the Persian, whose fate
      depended on the caprice of a single tyrant. Some salutary
      restraints, imposed by the people or their own passions, were at
      once the cause and effect of the gravity and temperance of the
      Romans. The right of accusation was confined to the magistrates.

      A vote of the thirty five tribes could inflict a fine; but the
      cognizance of all capital crimes was reserved by a fundamental
      law to the assembly of the centuries, in which the weight of
      influence and property was sure to preponderate. Repeated
      proclamations and adjournments were interposed, to allow time for
      prejudice and resentment to subside: the whole proceeding might
      be annulled by a seasonable omen, or the opposition of a tribune;
      and such popular trials were commonly less formidable to
      innocence than they were favorable to guilt. But this union of
      the judicial and legislative powers left it doubtful whether the
      accused party was pardoned or acquitted; and, in the defence of
      an illustrious client, the orators of Rome and Athens address
      their arguments to the policy and benevolence, as well as to the
      justice, of their sovereign. 2. The task of convening the
      citizens for the trial of each offender became more difficult, as
      the citizens and the offenders continually multiplied; and the
      ready expedient was adopted of delegating the jurisdiction of the
      people to the ordinary magistrates, or to extraordinary
      inquisitors. In the first ages these questions were rare and
      occasional. In the beginning of the seventh century of Rome they
      were made perpetual: four praetors were annually empowered to sit
      in judgment on the state offences of treason, extortion,
      peculation, and bribery; and Sylla added new praetors and new
      questions for those crimes which more directly injure the safety
      of individuals. By these inquisitors the trial was prepared and
      directed; but they could only pronounce the sentence of the
      majority of judges, who with some truth, and more prejudice, have
      been compared to the English juries. 202 To discharge this
      important, though burdensome office, an annual list of ancient
      and respectable citizens was formed by the praetor. After many
      constitutional struggles, they were chosen in equal numbers from
      the senate, the equestrian order, and the people; four hundred
      and fifty were appointed for single questions; and the various
      rolls or decuries of judges must have contained the names of some
      thousand Romans, who represented the judicial authority of the
      state. In each particular cause, a sufficient number was drawn
      from the urn; their integrity was guarded by an oath; the mode of
      ballot secured their independence; the suspicion of partiality
      was removed by the mutual challenges of the accuser and
      defendant; and the judges of Milo, by the retrenchment of fifteen
      on each side, were reduced to fifty-one voices or tablets, of
      acquittal, of condemnation, or of favorable doubt. 203 3. In his
      civil jurisdiction, the praetor of the city was truly a judge,
      and almost a legislator; but, as soon as he had prescribed the
      action of law, he often referred to a delegate the determination
      of the fact. With the increase of legal proceedings, the tribunal
      of the centumvirs, in which he presided, acquired more weight and
      reputation. But whether he acted alone, or with the advice of his
      council, the most absolute powers might be trusted to a
      magistrate who was annually chosen by the votes of the people.
      The rules and precautions of freedom have required some
      explanation; the order of despotism is simple and inanimate.
      Before the age of Justinian, or perhaps of Diocletian, the
      decuries of Roman judges had sunk to an empty title: the humble
      advice of the assessors might be accepted or despised; and in
      each tribunal the civil and criminal jurisdiction was
      administered by a single magistrate, who was raised and disgraced
      by the will of the emperor.

      knowledge.]

      A Roman accused of any capital crime might prevent the sentence
      of the law by voluntary exile, or death. Till his guilt had been
      legally proved, his innocence was presumed, and his person was
      free: till the votes of the last century had been counted and
      declared, he might peaceably secede to any of the allied cities
      of Italy, or Greece, or Asia. 204 His fame and fortunes were
      preserved, at least to his children, by this civil death; and he
      might still be happy in every rational and sensual enjoyment, if
      a mind accustomed to the ambitious tumult of Rome could support
      the uniformity and silence of Rhodes or Athens. A bolder effort
      was required to escape from the tyranny of the Caesars; but this
      effort was rendered familiar by the maxims of the stoics, the
      example of the bravest Romans, and the legal encouragements of
      suicide. The bodies of condemned criminals were exposed to public
      ignominy, and their children, a more serious evil, were reduced
      to poverty by the confiscation of their fortunes. But, if the
      victims of Tiberius and Nero anticipated the decree of the prince
      or senate, their courage and despatch were recompensed by the
      applause of the public, the decent honors of burial, and the
      validity of their testaments. 205 The exquisite avarice and
      cruelty of Domitian appear to have deprived the unfortunate of
      this last consolation, and it was still denied even by the
      clemency of the Antonines. A voluntary death, which, in the case
      of a capital offence, intervened between the accusation and the
      sentence, was admitted as a confession of guilt, and the spoils
      of the deceased were seized by the inhuman claims of the
      treasury. 206 Yet the civilians have always respected the natural
      right of a citizen to dispose of his life; and the posthumous
      disgrace invented by Tarquin, 207 to check the despair of his
      subjects, was never revived or imitated by succeeding tyrants.
      The powers of this world have indeed lost their dominion over him
      who is resolved on death; and his arm can only be restrained by
      the religious apprehension of a future state. Suicides are
      enumerated by Virgil among the unfortunate, rather than the
      guilty; 208 and the poetical fables of the infernal shades could
      not seriously influence the faith or practice of mankind. But the
      precepts of the gospel, or the church, have at length imposed a
      pious servitude on the minds of Christians, and condemn them to
      expect, without a murmur, the last stroke of disease or the
      executioner.

      suicides with infants, lovers, and persons unjustly condemned.
      Heyne, the best of his editors, is at a loss to deduce the idea,
      or ascertain the jurisprudence, of the Roman poet.]

      The penal statutes form a very small proportion of the sixty-two
      books of the Code and Pandects; and in all judicial proceedings,
      the life or death of a citizen is determined with less caution or
      delay than the most ordinary question of covenant or inheritance.
      This singular distinction, though something may be allowed for
      the urgent necessity of defending the peace of society, is
      derived from the nature of criminal and civil jurisprudence. Our
      duties to the state are simple and uniform: the law by which he
      is condemned is inscribed not only on brass or marble, but on the
      conscience of the offender, and his guilt is commonly proved by
      the testimony of a single fact. But our relations to each other
      are various and infinite; our obligations are created, annulled,
      and modified, by injuries, benefits, and promises; and the
      interpretation of voluntary contracts and testaments, which are
      often dictated by fraud or ignorance, affords a long and
      laborious exercise to the sagacity of the judge. The business of
      life is multiplied by the extent of commerce and dominion, and
      the residence of the parties in the distant provinces of an
      empire is productive of doubt, delay, and inevitable appeals from
      the local to the supreme magistrate. Justinian, the Greek emperor
      of Constantinople and the East, was the legal successor of the
      Latin shepherd who had planted a colony on the banks of the
      Tyber. In a period of thirteen hundred years, the laws had
      reluctantly followed the changes of government and manners; and
      the laudable desire of conciliating ancient names with recent
      institutions destroyed the harmony, and swelled the magnitude, of
      the obscure and irregular system. The laws which excuse, on any
      occasions, the ignorance of their subjects, confess their own
      imperfections: the civil jurisprudence, as it was abridged by
      Justinian, still continued a mysterious science, and a profitable
      trade, and the innate perplexity of the study was involved in
      tenfold darkness by the private industry of the practitioners.
      The expense of the pursuit sometimes exceeded the value of the
      prize, and the fairest rights were abandoned by the poverty or
      prudence of the claimants. Such costly justice might tend to
      abate the spirit of litigation, but the unequal pressure serves
      only to increase the influence of the rich, and to aggravate the
      misery of the poor. By these dilatory and expensive proceedings,
      the wealthy pleader obtains a more certain advantage than he
      could hope from the accidental corruption of his judge. The
      experience of an abuse, from which our own age and country are
      not perfectly exempt, may sometimes provoke a generous
      indignation, and extort the hasty wish of exchanging our
      elaborate jurisprudence for the simple and summary decrees of a
      Turkish cadhi. Our calmer reflection will suggest, that such
      forms and delays are necessary to guard the person and property
      of the citizen; that the discretion of the judge is the first
      engine of tyranny; and that the laws of a free people should
      foresee and determine every question that may probably arise in
      the exercise of power and the transactions of industry. But the
      government of Justinian united the evils of liberty and
      servitude; and the Romans were oppressed at the same time by the
      multiplicity of their laws and the arbitrary will of their
      master.
