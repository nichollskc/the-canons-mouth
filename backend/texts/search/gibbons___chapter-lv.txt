Chapter LV: The Bulgarians, The Hungarians And The Russians.—Part
      I.

     The Bulgarians.—Origin, Migrations, And Settlement Of The
     Hungarians.—Their Inroads In The East And West.—The Monarchy Of
     Russia.—Geography And Trade.—Wars Of The Russians Against The
     Greek Empire.—Conversion Of The Barbarians.

      Under the reign of Constantine the grandson of Heraclius, the
      ancient barrier of the Danube, so often violated and so often
      restored, was irretrievably swept away by a new deluge of
      Barbarians. Their progress was favored by the caliphs, their
      unknown and accidental auxiliaries: the Roman legions were
      occupied in Asia; and after the loss of Syria, Egypt, and Africa,
      the Caesars were twice reduced to the danger and disgrace of
      defending their capital against the Saracens. If, in the account
      of this interesting people, I have deviated from the strict and
      original line of my undertaking, the merit of the subject will
      hide my transgression, or solicit my excuse. In the East, in the
      West, in war, in religion, in science, in their prosperity, and
      in their decay, the Arabians press themselves on our curiosity:
      the first overthrow of the church and empire of the Greeks may be
      imputed to their arms; and the disciples of Mahomet still hold
      the civil and religious sceptre of the Oriental world. But the
      same labor would be unworthily bestowed on the swarms of savages,
      who, between the seventh and the twelfth century, descended from
      the plains of Scythia, in transient inroad or perpetual
      emigration. 1 Their names are uncouth, their origins doubtful,
      their actions obscure, their superstition was blind, their valor
      brutal, and the uniformity of their public and private lives was
      neither softened by innocence nor refined by policy. The majesty
      of the Byzantine throne repelled and survived their disorderly
      attacks; the greater part of these Barbarians has disappeared
      without leaving any memorial of their existence, and the
      despicable remnant continues, and may long continue, to groan
      under the dominion of a foreign tyrant. From the antiquities of,
      I. Bulgarians, II. Hungarians, and, III. Russians, I shall
      content myself with selecting such facts as yet deserve to be
      remembered. The conquests of the, IV. Normans, and the monarchy
      of the, V. Turks, will naturally terminate in the memorable
      Crusades to the Holy Land, and the double fall of the city and
      empire of Constantine.

      1 (return) [ All the passages of the Byzantine history which
      relate to the Barbarians are compiled, methodized, and
      transcribed, in a Latin version, by the laborious John Gotthelf
      Stritter, in his “Memoriae Populorum, ad Danubium, Pontum
      Euxinum, Paludem Maeotidem, Caucasum, Mare Caspium, et inde Magis

      I. In his march to Italy, Theodoric 2 the Ostrogoth had trampled
      on the arms of the Bulgarians. After this defeat, the name and
      the nation are lost during a century and a half; and it may be
      suspected that the same or a similar appellation was revived by
      strange colonies from the Borysthenes, the Tanais, or the Volga.
      A king of the ancient Bulgaria, 3 bequeathed to his five sons a
      last lesson of moderation and concord. It was received as youth
      has ever received the counsels of age and experience: the five
      princes buried their father; divided his subjects and cattle;
      forgot his advice; separated from each other; and wandered in
      quest of fortune till we find the most adventurous in the heart
      of Italy, under the protection of the exarch of Ravenna. 4 But
      the stream of emigration was directed or impelled towards the
      capital. The modern Bulgaria, along the southern banks of the
      Danube, was stamped with the name and image which it has retained
      to the present hour: the new conquerors successively acquired, by
      war or treaty, the Roman provinces of Dardania, Thessaly, and the
      two Epirus; 5 the ecclesiastical supremacy was translated from
      the native city of Justinian; and, in their prosperous age, the
      obscure town of Lychnidus, or Achrida, was honored with the
      throne of a king and a patriarch. 6 The unquestionable evidence
      of language attests the descent of the Bulgarians from the
      original stock of the Sclavonian, or more properly Slavonian,
      race; 7 and the kindred bands of Servians, Bosnians, Rascians,
      Croatians, Walachians, 8 &c., followed either the standard or the
      example of the leading tribe. From the Euxine to the Adriatic, in
      the state of captives, or subjects, or allies, or enemies, of the
      Greek empire, they overspread the land; and the national
      appellation of the slaves 9 has been degraded by chance or malice
      from the signification of glory to that of servitude. 10 Among
      these colonies, the Chrobatians, 11 or Croats, who now attend the
      motions of an Austrian army, are the descendants of a mighty
      people, the conquerors and sovereigns of Dalmatia. The maritime
      cities, and of these the infant republic of Ragusa, implored the
      aid and instructions of the Byzantine court: they were advised by
      the magnanimous Basil to reserve a small acknowledgment of their
      fidelity to the Roman empire, and to appease, by an annual
      tribute, the wrath of these irresistible Barbarians. The kingdom
      of Crotia was shared by eleven Zoupans, or feudatory lords; and
      their united forces were numbered at sixty thousand horse and one
      hundred thousand foot. A long sea-coast, indented with capacious
      harbors, covered with a string of islands, and almost in sight of
      the Italian shores, disposed both the natives and strangers to
      the practice of navigation. The boats or brigantines of the
      Croats were constructed after the fashion of the old Liburnians:
      one hundred and eighty vessels may excite the idea of a
      respectable navy; but our seamen will smile at the allowance of
      ten, or twenty, or forty, men for each of these ships of war.
      They were gradually converted to the more honorable service of
      commerce; yet the Sclavonian pirates were still frequent and
      dangerous; and it was not before the close of the tenth century
      that the freedom and sovereignty of the Gulf were effectually
      vindicated by the Venetian republic. 12 The ancestors of these
      Dalmatian kings were equally removed from the use and abuse of
      navigation: they dwelt in the White Croatia, in the inland
      regions of Silesia and Little Poland, thirty days’ journey,
      according to the Greek computation, from the sea of darkness.

      are clearly expressed in Cedrenus, (p. 713.) The removal of an

      at length to Ternovo, has produced some perplexity in the ideas

      but his plan is narrow, his style barbarous, his criticism
      shallow, and the Aulic counsellor is not free from the prejudices
      of a Bohemian. * Note: We have at length a profound and

      derivation from Slava, laus, gloria, a word of familiar use in
      the different dialects and parts of speech, and which forms the
      termination of the most illustrious names, (de Originibus
      Sclavicis, pars. i. p. 40, pars. iv. p. 101, 102)]

      10 (return) [ This conversion of a national into an appellative
      name appears to have arisen in the viiith century, in the
      Oriental France, where the princes and bishops were rich in
      Sclavonian captives, not of the Bohemian, (exclaims Jordan,) but
      of Sorabian race. From thence the word was extended to the
      general use, to the modern languages, and even to the style of
      the last Byzantines, (see the Greek and Latin Glossaries and
      Ducange.) The confusion of the Servians with the Latin Servi, was
      still more fortunate and familiar, (Constant. Porphyr. de
      Administrando, Imperio, c. 32, p. 99.)]

      xii. p. 227-230,) the two oldest monuments of the history of
      Venice.]

      The glory of the Bulgarians 13 was confined to a narrow scope
      both of time and place. In the ninth and tenth centuries, they
      reigned to the south of the Danube; but the more powerful nations
      that had followed their emigration repelled all return to the
      north and all progress to the west. Yet in the obscure catalogue
      of their exploits, they might boast an honor which had hitherto
      been appropriated to the Goths: that of slaying in battle one of
      the successors of Augustus and Constantine. The emperor
      Nicephorus had lost his fame in the Arabian, he lost his life in
      the Sclavonian, war. In his first operations he advanced with
      boldness and success into the centre of Bulgaria, and burnt the
      royal court, which was probably no more than an edifice and
      village of timber. But while he searched the spoil and refused
      all offers of treaty, his enemies collected their spirits and
      their forces: the passes of retreat were insuperably barred; and
      the trembling Nicephorus was heard to exclaim, “Alas, alas!
      unless we could assume the wings of birds, we cannot hope to
      escape.” Two days he waited his fate in the inactivity of
      despair; but, on the morning of the third, the Bulgarians
      surprised the camp, and the Roman prince, with the great officers
      of the empire, were slaughtered in their tents. The body of
      Valens had been saved from insult; but the head of Nicephorus was
      exposed on a spear, and his skull, enchased with gold, was often
      replenished in the feasts of victory. The Greeks bewailed the
      dishonor of the throne; but they acknowledged the just punishment
      of avarice and cruelty. This savage cup was deeply tinctured with
      the manners of the Scythian wilderness; but they were softened
      before the end of the same century by a peaceful intercourse with
      the Greeks, the possession of a cultivated region, and the
      introduction of the Christian worship. The nobles of Bulgaria
      were educated in the schools and palace of Constantinople; and
      Simeon, 14 a youth of the royal line, was instructed in the
      rhetoric of Demosthenes and the logic of Aristotle. He
      relinquished the profession of a monk for that of a king and
      warrior; and in his reign of more than forty years, Bulgaria
      assumed a rank among the civilized powers of the earth. The
      Greeks, whom he repeatedly attacked, derived a faint consolation
      from indulging themselves in the reproaches of perfidy and
      sacrilege. They purchased the aid of the Pagan Turks; but Simeon,
      in a second battle, redeemed the loss of the first, at a time
      when it was esteemed a victory to elude the arms of that
      formidable nation. The Servians were overthrown, made captive and
      dispersed; and those who visited the country before their
      restoration could discover no more than fifty vagrants, without
      women or children, who extorted a precarious subsistence from the
      chase. On classic ground, on the banks of Achelous, the greeks
      were defeated; their horn was broken by the strength of the
      Barbaric Hercules. 15 He formed the siege of Constantinople; and,
      in a personal conference with the emperor, Simeon imposed the
      conditions of peace. They met with the most jealous precautions:
      the royal gallery was drawn close to an artificial and
      well-fortified platform; and the majesty of the purple was
      emulated by the pomp of the Bulgarian. “Are you a Christian?”
      said the humble Romanus: “it is your duty to abstain from the
      blood of your fellow-Christians. Has the thirst of riches seduced
      you from the blessings of peace? Sheathe your sword, open your
      hand, and I will satiate the utmost measure of your desires.” The
      reconciliation was sealed by a domestic alliance; the freedom of
      trade was granted or restored; the first honors of the court were
      secured to the friends of Bulgaria, above the ambassadors of
      enemies or strangers; 16 and her princes were dignified with the
      high and invidious title of Basileus, or emperor. But this
      friendship was soon disturbed: after the death of Simeon, the
      nations were again in arms; his feeble successors were divided
      and extinguished; and, in the beginning of the eleventh century,
      the second Basil, who was born in the purple, deserved the
      appellation of conqueror of the Bulgarians. His avarice was in
      some measure gratified by a treasure of four hundred thousand
      pounds sterling, (ten thousand pounds’ weight of gold,) which he
      found in the palace of Lychnidus. His cruelty inflicted a cool
      and exquisite vengeance on fifteen thousand captives who had been
      guilty of the defence of their country. They were deprived of
      sight; but to one of each hundred a single eye was left, that he
      might conduct his blind century to the presence of their king.
      Their king is said to have expired of grief and horror; the
      nation was awed by this terrible example; the Bulgarians were
      swept away from their settlements, and circumscribed within a
      narrow province; the surviving chiefs bequeathed to their
      children the advice of patience and the duty of revenge.

      II. When the black swarm of Hungarians first hung over Europe,
      above nine hundred years after the Christian aera, they were
      mistaken by fear and superstition for the Gog and Magog of the
      Scriptures, the signs and forerunners of the end of the world. 17
      Since the introduction of letters, they have explored their own
      antiquities with a strong and laudable impulse of patriotic
      curiosity. 18 Their rational criticism can no longer be amused
      with a vain pedigree of Attila and the Huns; but they complain
      that their primitive records have perished in the Tartar war;
      that the truth or fiction of their rustic songs is long since
      forgotten; and that the fragments of a rude chronicle 19 must be
      painfully reconciled with the contemporary though foreign
      intelligence of the imperial geographer. 20 Magiar is the
      national and oriental denomination of the Hungarians; but, among
      the tribes of Scythia, they are distinguished by the Greeks under
      the proper and peculiar name of Turks, as the descendants of that
      mighty people who had conquered and reigned from China to the
      Volga. The Pannonian colony preserved a correspondence of trade
      and amity with the eastern Turks on the confines of Persia and
      after a separation of three hundred and fifty years, the
      missionaries of the king of Hungary discovered and visited their
      ancient country near the banks of the Volga. They were hospitably
      entertained by a people of Pagans and Savages who still bore the
      name of Hungarians; conversed in their native tongue, recollected
      a tradition of their long-lost brethren, and listened with
      amazement to the marvellous tale of their new kingdom and
      religion. The zeal of conversion was animated by the interest of
      consanguinity; and one of the greatest of their princes had
      formed the generous, though fruitless, design of replenishing the
      solitude of Pannonia by this domestic colony from the heart of
      Tartary. 21 From this primitive country they were driven to the
      West by the tide of war and emigration, by the weight of the more
      distant tribes, who at the same time were fugitives and
      conquerors. 2111 Reason or fortune directed their course towards
      the frontiers of the Roman empire: they halted in the usual
      stations along the banks of the great rivers; and in the
      territories of Moscow, Kiow, and Moldavia, some vestiges have
      been discovered of their temporary residence. In this long and
      various peregrination, they could not always escape the dominion
      of the stronger; and the purity of their blood was improved or
      sullied by the mixture of a foreign race: from a motive of
      compulsion, or choice, several tribes of the Chazars were
      associated to the standard of their ancient vassals; introduced
      the use of a second language; and obtained by their superior
      renown the most honorable place in the front of battle. The
      military force of the Turks and their allies marched in seven
      equal and artificial divisions; each division was formed of
      thirty thousand eight hundred and fifty-seven warriors, and the
      proportion of women, children, and servants, supposes and
      requires at least a million of emigrants. Their public counsels
      were directed by seven vayvods, or hereditary chiefs; but the
      experience of discord and weakness recommended the more simple
      and vigorous administration of a single person. The sceptre,
      which had been declined by the modest Lebedias, was granted to
      the birth or merit of Almus and his son Arpad, and the authority
      of the supreme khan of the Chazars confirmed the engagement of
      the prince and people; of the people to obey his commands, of the
      prince to consult their happiness and glory.

      17 (return) [ A bishop of Wurtzburgh submitted his opinion to a
      reverend abbot; but he more gravely decided, that Gog and Magog
      were the spiritual persecutors of the church; since Gog signifies
      the root, the pride of the Heresiarchs, and Magog what comes from
      the root, the propagation of their sects. Yet these men once
      commanded the respect of mankind, (Fleury, Hist. Eccles. tom. xi.
      p. 594, &c.)]

      18 (return) [ The two national authors, from whom I have derived
      the mos assistance, are George Pray (Dissertationes and Annales
      veterum Hun garorum, &c., Vindobonae, 1775, in folio) and Stephen
      Katona, (Hist. Critica Ducum et Regum Hungariae Stirpis
      Arpadianae, Paestini, 1778-1781, 5 vols. in octavo.) The first
      embraces a large and often conjectural space; the latter, by his
      learning, judgment, and perspicuity, deserves the name of a
      critical historian. * Note: Compare Engel Geschichte des
      Ungrischen Reichs und seiner Neben lander, Halle, 1797, and
      Mailath, Geschichte der Magyaren, Wien, 1828. In an appendix to
      the latter work will be found a brief abstract of the
      speculations (for it is difficult to consider them more) which
      have been advanced by the learned, on the origin of the Magyar
      and Hungarian names. Compare vol. vi. p. 35, note.—M.]

      19 (return) [ The author of this Chronicle is styled the notary
      of King Bela. Katona has assigned him to the xiith century, and
      defends his character against the hypercriticism of Pray. This
      rude annalist must have transcribed some historical records,
      since he could affirm with dignity, rejectis falsis fabulis
      rusticorum, et garrulo cantu joculatorum. In the xvth century,
      these fables were collected by Thurotzius, and embellished by the
      Italian Bonfinius. See the Preliminary Discourse in the Hist.
      Critica Ducum, p. 7-33.]

      20 (return) [ See Constantine de Administrando Imperio, c. 3, 4,
      13, 38-42, Katona has nicely fixed the composition of this work
      to the years 949, 950, 951, (p. 4-7.) The critical historian (p.
      34-107) endeavors to prove the existence, and to relate the
      actions, of a first duke Almus the father of Arpad, who is
      tacitly rejected by Constantine.]

      21 (return) [ Pray (Dissert. p. 37-39, &c.) produces and
      illustrates the original passages of the Hungarian missionaries,
      Bonfinius and Aeneas Sylvius.]

      2111 (return) [ In the deserts to the south-east of Astrakhan
      have been found the ruins of a city named Madchar, which proves
      the residence of the Hungarians or Magiar in those regions.
      Precis de la Geog. Univ. par Malte Brun, vol. i. p. 353.—G.——This
      is contested by Klaproth in his Travels, c. xxi. Madschar, (he
      states) in old Tartar, means “stone building.” This was a Tartar
      city mentioned by the Mahometan writers.—M.]

      With this narrative we might be reasonably content, if the
      penetration of modern learning had not opened a new and larger
      prospect of the antiquities of nations. The Hungarian language
      stands alone, and as it were insulated, among the Sclavonian
      dialects; but it bears a close and clear affinity to the idioms
      of the Fennic race, 22 of an obsolete and savage race, which
      formerly occupied the northern regions of Asia and Europe. 2211
      The genuine appellation of Ugri or Igours is found on the western
      confines of China; 23 their migration to the banks of the Irtish
      is attested by Tartar evidence; 24 a similar name and language
      are detected in the southern parts of Siberia; 25 and the remains
      of the Fennic tribes are widely, though thinly scattered from the
      sources of the Oby to the shores of Lapland. 26 The consanguinity
      of the Hungarians and Laplanders would display the powerful
      energy of climate on the children of a common parent; the lively
      contrast between the bold adventurers who are intoxicated with
      the wines of the Danube, and the wretched fugitives who are
      immersed beneath the snows of the polar circle.

      Arms and freedom have ever been the ruling, though too often the
      unsuccessful, passion of the Hungarians, who are endowed by
      nature with a vigorous constitution of soul and body. 27 Extreme
      cold has diminished the stature and congealed the faculties of
      the Laplanders; and the arctic tribes, alone among the sons of
      men, are ignorant of war, and unconscious of human blood; a happy
      ignorance, if reason and virtue were the guardians of their
      peace! 28

      Chapter LV: The Bulgarians, The Hungarians And The Russians.—Part
      II.

      It is the observation of the Imperial author of the Tactics, 29
      that all the Scythian hordes resembled each other in their
      pastoral and military life, that they all practised the same
      means of subsistence, and employed the same instruments of
      destruction. But he adds, that the two nations of Bulgarians and
      Hungarians were superior to their brethren, and similar to each
      other in the improvements, however rude, of their discipline and
      government: their visible likeness determines Leo to confound his
      friends and enemies in one common description; and the picture
      may be heightened by some strokes from their contemporaries of
      the tenth century. Except the merit and fame of military prowess,
      all that is valued by mankind appeared vile and contemptible to
      these Barbarians, whose native fierceness was stimulated by the
      consciousness of numbers and freedom. The tents of the Hungarians
      were of leather, their garments of fur; they shaved their hair,
      and scarified their faces: in speech they were slow, in action
      prompt, in treaty perfidious; and they shared the common reproach
      of Barbarians, too ignorant to conceive the importance of truth,
      too proud to deny or palliate the breach of their most solemn
      engagements. Their simplicity has been praised; yet they
      abstained only from the luxury they had never known; whatever
      they saw they coveted; their desires were insatiate, and their
      sole industry was the hand of violence and rapine. By the
      definition of a pastoral nation, I have recalled a long
      description of the economy, the warfare, and the government that
      prevail in that state of society; I may add, that to fishing, as
      well as to the chase, the Hungarians were indebted for a part of
      their subsistence; and since they seldom cultivated the ground,
      they must, at least in their new settlements, have sometimes
      practised a slight and unskilful husbandry. In their emigrations,
      perhaps in their expeditions, the host was accompanied by
      thousands of sheep and oxen which increased the cloud of
      formidable dust, and afforded a constant and wholesale supply of
      milk and animal food. A plentiful command of forage was the first
      care of the general, and if the flocks and herds were secure of
      their pastures, the hardy warrior was alike insensible of danger
      and fatigue. The confusion of men and cattle that overspread the
      country exposed their camp to a nocturnal surprise, had not a
      still wider circuit been occupied by their light cavalry,
      perpetually in motion to discover and delay the approach of the
      enemy. After some experience of the Roman tactics, they adopted
      the use of the sword and spear, the helmet of the soldier, and
      the iron breastplate of his steed: but their native and deadly
      weapon was the Tartar bow: from the earliest infancy their
      children and servants were exercised in the double science of
      archery and horsemanship; their arm was strong; their aim was
      sure; and in the most rapid career, they were taught to throw
      themselves backwards, and to shoot a volley of arrows into the
      air. In open combat, in secret ambush, in flight, or pursuit,
      they were equally formidable; an appearance of order was
      maintained in the foremost ranks, but their charge was driven
      forwards by the impatient pressure of succeeding crowds. They
      pursued, headlong and rash, with loosened reins and horrific
      outcries; but, if they fled, with real or dissembled fear, the
      ardor of a pursuing foe was checked and chastised by the same
      habits of irregular speed and sudden evolution. In the abuse of
      victory, they astonished Europe, yet smarting from the wounds of
      the Saracen and the Dane: mercy they rarely asked, and more
      rarely bestowed: both sexes if accused is equally inaccessible to
      pity, and their appetite for raw flesh might countenance the
      popular tale, that they drank the blood, and feasted on the
      hearts of the slain. Yet the Hungarians were not devoid of those
      principles of justice and humanity, which nature has implanted in
      every bosom. The license of public and private injuries was
      restrained by laws and punishments; and in the security of an
      open camp, theft is the most tempting and most dangerous offence.
      Among the Barbarians there were many, whose spontaneous virtue
      supplied their laws and corrected their manners, who performed
      the duties, and sympathized with the affections, of social life.

      29 (return) [ Leo has observed, that the government of the Turks
      was monarchical, and that their punishments were rigorous,
      (Tactic. p. 896) Rhegino (in Chron. A.D. 889) mentions theft as a
      capital crime, and his jurisprudence is confirmed by the original
      code of St. Stephen, (A.D. 1016.) If a slave were guilty, he was
      chastised, for the first time, with the loss of his nose, or a
      fine of five heifers; for the second, with the loss of his ears,
      or a similar fine; for the third, with death; which the freeman
      did not incur till the fourth offence, as his first penalty was
      the loss of liberty, (Katona, Hist. Regum Hungar tom. i. p. 231,
      232.)]

      After a long pilgrimage of flight or victory, the Turkish hordes
      approached the common limits of the French and Byzantine empires.
      Their first conquests and final settlements extended on either
      side of the Danube above Vienna, below Belgrade, and beyond the
      measure of the Roman province of Pannonia, or the modern kingdom
      of Hungary. 30 That ample and fertile land was loosely occupied
      by the Moravians, a Sclavonian name and tribe, which were driven
      by the invaders into the compass of a narrow province.
      Charlemagne had stretched a vague and nominal empire as far as
      the edge of Transylvania; but, after the failure of his
      legitimate line, the dukes of Moravia forgot their obedience and
      tribute to the monarchs of Oriental France. The bastard Arnulph
      was provoked to invite the arms of the Turks: they rushed through
      the real or figurative wall, which his indiscretion had thrown
      open; and the king of Germany has been justly reproached as a
      traitor to the civil and ecclesiastical society of the
      Christians. During the life of Arnulph, the Hungarians were
      checked by gratitude or fear; but in the infancy of his son Lewis
      they discovered and invaded Bavaria; and such was their Scythian
      speed, that in a single day a circuit of fifty miles was stripped
      and consumed. In the battle of Augsburgh the Christians
      maintained their advantage till the seventh hour of the day, they
      were deceived and vanquished by the flying stratagems of the
      Turkish cavalry. The conflagration spread over the provinces of
      Bavaria, Swabia, and Franconia; and the Hungarians 31 promoted
      the reign of anarchy, by forcing the stoutest barons to
      discipline their vassals and fortify their castles. The origin of
      walled towns is ascribed to this calamitous period; nor could any
      distance be secure against an enemy, who, almost at the same
      instant, laid in ashes the Helvetian monastery of St. Gall, and
      the city of Bremen, on the shores of the northern ocean. Above
      thirty years the Germanic empire, or kingdom, was subject to the
      ignominy of tribute; and resistance was disarmed by the menace,
      the serious and effectual menace of dragging the women and
      children into captivity, and of slaughtering the males above the
      age of ten years. I have neither power nor inclination to follow
      the Hungarians beyond the Rhine; but I must observe with
      surprise, that the southern provinces of France were blasted by
      the tempest, and that Spain, behind her Pyrenees, was astonished
      at the approach of these formidable strangers. 32 The vicinity of
      Italy had tempted their early inroads; but from their camp on the
      Brenta, they beheld with some terror the apparent strength and
      populousness of the new discovered country. They requested leave
      to retire; their request was proudly rejected by the Italian
      king; and the lives of twenty thousand Christians paid the
      forfeit of his obstinacy and rashness. Among the cities of the
      West, the royal Pavia was conspicuous in fame and splendor; and
      the preeminence of Rome itself was only derived from the relics
      of the apostles. The Hungarians appeared; Pavia was in flames;
      forty-three churches were consumed; and, after the massacre of
      the people, they spared about two hundred wretches who had
      gathered some bushels of gold and silver (a vague exaggeration)
      from the smoking ruins of their country. In these annual
      excursions from the Alps to the neighborhood of Rome and Capua,
      the churches, that yet escaped, resounded with a fearful litany:
      “O, save and deliver us from the arrows of the Hungarians!” But
      the saints were deaf or inexorable; and the torrent rolled
      forwards, till it was stopped by the extreme land of Calabria. 33
      A composition was offered and accepted for the head of each
      Italian subject; and ten bushels of silver were poured forth in
      the Turkish camp. But falsehood is the natural antagonist of
      violence; and the robbers were defrauded both in the numbers of
      the assessment and the standard of the metal. On the side of the
      East, the Hungarians were opposed in doubtful conflict by the
      equal arms of the Bulgarians, whose faith forbade an alliance
      with the Pagans, and whose situation formed the barrier of the
      Byzantine empire. The barrier was overturned; the emperor of
      Constantinople beheld the waving banners of the Turks; and one of
      their boldest warriors presumed to strike a battle-axe into the
      golden gate. The arts and treasures of the Greeks diverted the
      assault; but the Hungarians might boast, in their retreat, that
      they had imposed a tribute on the spirit of Bulgaria and the
      majesty of the Caesars. 34 The remote and rapid operations of the
      same campaign appear to magnify the power and numbers of the
      Turks; but their courage is most deserving of praise, since a
      light troop of three or four hundred horse would often attempt
      and execute the most daring inroads to the gates of Thessalonica
      and Constantinople. At this disastrous aera of the ninth and
      tenth centuries, Europe was afflicted by a triple scourge from
      the North, the East, and the South: the Norman, the Hungarian,
      and the Saracen, sometimes trod the same ground of desolation;
      and these savage foes might have been compared by Homer to the
      two lions growling over the carcass of a mangled stag. 35

      glorious to the nation, it is denied or doubted by the critical
      historian, and even by the notary of Bela. Their scepticism is
      meritorious; they could not safely transcribe or believe the

      35 (return) [—Iliad, xvi. 756.]

      The deliverance of Germany and Christendom was achieved by the
      Saxon princes, Henry the Fowler and Otho the Great, who, in two
      memorable battles, forever broke the power of the Hungarians. 36
      The valiant Henry was roused from a bed of sickness by the
      invasion of his country; but his mind was vigorous and his
      prudence successful. “My companions,” said he, on the morning of
      the combat, “maintain your ranks, receive on your bucklers the
      first arrows of the Pagans, and prevent their second discharge by
      the equal and rapid career of your lances.” They obeyed and
      conquered: and the historical picture of the castle of Merseburgh
      expressed the features, or at least the character, of Henry, who,
      in an age of ignorance, intrusted to the finer arts the
      perpetuity of his name. 37 At the end of twenty years, the
      children of the Turks who had fallen by his sword invaded the
      empire of his son; and their force is defined, in the lowest
      estimate, at one hundred thousand horse. They were invited by
      domestic faction; the gates of Germany were treacherously
      unlocked; and they spread, far beyond the Rhine and the Meuse,
      into the heart of Flanders. But the vigor and prudence of Otho
      dispelled the conspiracy; the princes were made sensible that
      unless they were true to each other, their religion and country
      were irrecoverably lost; and the national powers were reviewed in
      the plains of Augsburgh. They marched and fought in eight
      legions, according to the division of provinces and tribes; the
      first, second, and third, were composed of Bavarians; the fourth,
      of Franconians; the fifth, of Saxons, under the immediate command
      of the monarch; the sixth and seventh consisted of Swabians; and
      the eighth legion, of a thousand Bohemians, closed the rear of
      the host. The resources of discipline and valor were fortified by
      the arts of superstition, which, on this occasion, may deserve
      the epithets of generous and salutary. The soldiers were purified
      with a fast; the camp was blessed with the relics of saints and
      martyrs; and the Christian hero girded on his side the sword of
      Constantine, grasped the invincible spear of Charlemagne, and
      waved the banner of St. Maurice, the praefect of the Thebaean
      legion. But his firmest confidence was placed in the holy lance,
      38 whose point was fashioned of the nails of the cross, and which
      his father had extorted from the king of Burgundy, by the threats
      of war, and the gift of a province. The Hungarians were expected
      in the front; they secretly passed the Lech, a river of Bavaria
      that falls into the Danube; turned the rear of the Christian
      army; plundered the baggage, and disordered the legion of Bohemia
      and Swabia. The battle was restored by the Franconians, whose
      duke, the valiant Conrad, was pierced with an arrow as he rested
      from his fatigues: the Saxons fought under the eyes of their
      king; and his victory surpassed, in merit and importance, the
      triumphs of the last two hundred years. The loss of the
      Hungarians was still greater in the flight than in the action;
      they were encompassed by the rivers of Bavaria; and their past
      cruelties excluded them from the hope of mercy. Three captive
      princes were hanged at Ratisbon, the multitude of prisoners was
      slain or mutilated, and the fugitives, who presumed to appear in
      the face of their country, were condemned to everlasting poverty
      and disgrace. 39 Yet the spirit of the nation was humbled, and
      the most accessible passes of Hungary were fortified with a ditch
      and rampart. Adversity suggested the counsels of moderation and
      peace: the robbers of the West acquiesced in a sedentary life;
      and the next generation was taught, by a discerning prince, that
      far more might be gained by multiplying and exchanging the
      produce of a fruitful soil. The native race, the Turkish or
      Fennic blood, was mingled with new colonies of Scythian or
      Sclavonian origin; 40 many thousands of robust and industrious
      captives had been imported from all the countries of Europe; 41
      and after the marriage of Geisa with a Bavarian princess, he
      bestowed honors and estates on the nobles of Germany. 42 The son
      of Geisa was invested with the regal title, and the house of
      Arpad reigned three hundred years in the kingdom of Hungary. But
      the freeborn Barbarians were not dazzled by the lustre of the
      diadem, and the people asserted their indefeasible right of
      choosing, deposing, and punishing the hereditary servant of the
      state.

      III. The name of Russians 43 was first divulged, in the ninth
      century, by an embassy of Theophilus, emperor of the East, to the
      emperor of the West, Lewis, the son of Charlemagne. The Greeks
      were accompanied by the envoys of the great duke, or chagan, or
      czar, of the Russians. In their journey to Constantinople, they
      had traversed many hostile nations; and they hoped to escape the
      dangers of their return, by requesting the French monarch to
      transport them by sea to their native country. A closer
      examination detected their origin: they were the brethren of the
      Swedes and Normans, whose name was already odious and formidable
      in France; and it might justly be apprehended, that these Russian
      strangers were not the messengers of peace, but the emissaries of
      war. They were detained, while the Greeks were dismissed; and
      Lewis expected a more satisfactory account, that he might obey
      the laws of hospitality or prudence, according to the interest of
      both empires. 44 This Scandinavian origin of the people, or at
      least the princes, of Russia, may be confirmed and illustrated by
      the national annals 45 and the general history of the North. The
      Normans, who had so long been concealed by a veil of impenetrable
      darkness, suddenly burst forth in the spirit of naval and
      military enterprise. The vast, and, as it is said, the populous
      regions of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, were crowded with
      independent chieftains and desperate adventurers, who sighed in
      the laziness of peace, and smiled in the agonies of death. Piracy
      was the exercise, the trade, the glory, and the virtue, of the
      Scandinavian youth. Impatient of a bleak climate and narrow
      limits, they started from the banquet, grasped their arms,
      sounded their horn, ascended their vessels, and explored every
      coast that promised either spoil or settlement. The Baltic was
      the first scene of their naval achievements they visited the
      eastern shores, the silent residence of Fennic and Sclavonic
      tribes, and the primitive Russians of the Lake Ladoga paid a
      tribute, the skins of white squirrels, to these strangers, whom
      they saluted with the title of Varangians 46 or Corsairs. Their
      superiority in arms, discipline, and renown, commanded the fear
      and reverence of the natives. In their wars against the more
      inland savages, the Varangians condescended to serve as friends
      and auxiliaries, and gradually, by choice or conquest, obtained
      the dominion of a people whom they were qualified to protect.
      Their tyranny was expelled, their valor was again recalled, till
      at length Ruric, a Scandinavian chief, became the father of a
      dynasty which reigned above seven hundred years. His brothers
      extended his influence: the example of service and usurpation was
      imitated by his companions in the southern provinces of Russia;
      and their establishments, by the usual methods of war and
      assassination, were cemented into the fabric of a powerful
      monarchy.

      of the Annals of St. Bertin, who first names the Russians (Rhos)

      country. So Liutprand calls the Russians the same people as the

      As long as the descendants of Ruric were considered as aliens and
      conquerors, they ruled by the sword of the Varangians,
      distributed estates and subjects to their faithful captains, and
      supplied their numbers with fresh streams of adventurers from the
      Baltic coast. 47 But when the Scandinavian chiefs had struck a
      deep and permanent root into the soil, they mingled with the
      Russians in blood, religion, and language, and the first
      Waladimir had the merit of delivering his country from these
      foreign mercenaries. They had seated him on the throne; his
      riches were insufficient to satisfy their demands; but they
      listened to his pleasing advice, that they should seek, not a
      more grateful, but a more wealthy, master; that they should
      embark for Greece, where, instead of the skins of squirrels, silk
      and gold would be the recompense of their service. At the same
      time, the Russian prince admonished his Byzantine ally to
      disperse and employ, to recompense and restrain, these impetuous
      children of the North. Contemporary writers have recorded the
      introduction, name, and character, of the Varangians: each day
      they rose in confidence and esteem; the whole body was assembled
      at Constantinople to perform the duty of guards; and their
      strength was recruited by a numerous band of their countrymen
      from the Island of Thule. On this occasion, the vague appellation
      of Thule is applied to England; and the new Varangians were a
      colony of English and Danes who fled from the yoke of the Norman
      conqueror. The habits of pilgrimage and piracy had approximated
      the countries of the earth; these exiles were entertained in the
      Byzantine court; and they preserved, till the last age of the
      empire, the inheritance of spotless loyalty, and the use of the
      Danish or English tongue. With their broad and double-edged
      battle-axes on their shoulders, they attended the Greek emperor
      to the temple, the senate, and the hippodrome; he slept and
      feasted under their trusty guard; and the keys of the palace, the
      treasury, and the capital, were held by the firm and faithful
      hands of the Varangians. 48

      In the tenth century, the geography of Scythia was extended far
      beyond the limits of ancient knowledge; and the monarchy of the
      Russians obtains a vast and conspicuous place in the map of
      Constantine. 49 The sons of Ruric were masters of the spacious
      province of Wolodomir, or Moscow; and, if they were confined on
      that side by the hordes of the East, their western frontier in
      those early days was enlarged to the Baltic Sea and the country
      of the Prussians. Their northern reign ascended above the
      sixtieth degree of latitude over the Hyperborean regions, which
      fancy had peopled with monsters, or clouded with eternal
      darkness. To the south they followed the course of the
      Borysthenes, and approached with that river the neighborhood of
      the Euxine Sea. The tribes that dwelt, or wandered, in this ample
      circuit were obedient to the same conqueror, and insensibly
      blended into the same nation. The language of Russia is a dialect
      of the Sclavonian; but in the tenth century, these two modes of
      speech were different from each other; and, as the Sclavonian
      prevailed in the South, it may be presumed that the original
      Russians of the North, the primitive subjects of the Varangian
      chief, were a portion of the Fennic race. With the emigration,
      union, or dissolution, of the wandering tribes, the loose and
      indefinite picture of the Scythian desert has continually
      shifted. But the most ancient map of Russia affords some places
      which still retain their name and position; and the two capitals,
      Novogorod 50 and Kiow, 51 are coeval with the first age of the
      monarchy. Novogorod had not yet deserved the epithet of great,
      nor the alliance of the Hanseatic League, which diffused the
      streams of opulence and the principles of freedom. Kiow could not
      yet boast of three hundred churches, an innumerable people, and a
      degree of greatness and splendor which was compared with
      Constantinople by those who had never seen the residence of the
      Caesars. In their origin, the two cities were no more than camps
      or fairs, the most convenient stations in which the Barbarians
      might assemble for the occasional business of war or trade. Yet
      even these assemblies announce some progress in the arts of
      society; a new breed of cattle was imported from the southern
      provinces; and the spirit of commercial enterprise pervaded the
      sea and land, from the Baltic to the Euxine, from the mouth of
      the Oder to the port of Constantinople. In the days of idolatry
      and barbarism, the Sclavonic city of Julin was frequented and
      enriched by the Normans, who had prudently secured a free mart of
      purchase and exchange. 52 From this harbor, at the entrance of
      the Oder, the corsair, or merchant, sailed in forty-three days to
      the eastern shores of the Baltic, the most distant nations were
      intermingled, and the holy groves of Curland are said to have
      been decorated with Grecian and Spanish gold. 53 Between the sea
      and Novogorod an easy intercourse was discovered; in the summer,
      through a gulf, a lake, and a navigable river; in the winter
      season, over the hard and level surface of boundless snows. From
      the neighborhood of that city, the Russians descended the streams
      that fall into the Borysthenes; their canoes, of a single tree,
      were laden with slaves of every age, furs of every species, the
      spoil of their beehives, and the hides of their cattle; and the
      whole produce of the North was collected and discharged in the
      magazines of Kiow. The month of June was the ordinary season of
      the departure of the fleet: the timber of the canoes was framed
      into the oars and benches of more solid and capacious boats; and
      they proceeded without obstacle down the Borysthenes, as far as
      the seven or thirteen ridges of rocks, which traverse the bed,
      and precipitate the waters, of the river. At the more shallow
      falls it was sufficient to lighten the vessels; but the deeper
      cataracts were impassable; and the mariners, who dragged their
      vessels and their slaves six miles over land, were exposed in
      this toilsome journey to the robbers of the desert. 54 At the
      first island below the falls, the Russians celebrated the
      festival of their escape: at a second, near the mouth of the
      river, they repaired their shattered vessels for the longer and
      more perilous voyage of the Black Sea. If they steered along the
      coast, the Danube was accessible; with a fair wind they could
      reach in thirty-six or forty hours the opposite shores of
      Anatolia; and Constantinople admitted the annual visit of the
      strangers of the North. They returned at the stated season with a
      rich cargo of corn, wine, and oil, the manufactures of Greece,
      and the spices of India. Some of their countrymen resided in the
      capital and provinces; and the national treaties protected the
      persons, effects, and privileges, of the Russian merchant. 55

      III.

      But the same communication which had been opened for the benefit,
      was soon abused for the injury, of mankind. In a period of one
      hundred and ninety years, the Russians made four attempts to
      plunder the treasures of Constantinople: the event was various,
      but the motive, the means, and the object, were the same in these
      naval expeditions. 56 The Russian traders had seen the
      magnificence, and tasted the luxury of the city of the Caesars. A
      marvellous tale, and a scanty supply, excited the desires of
      their savage countrymen: they envied the gifts of nature which
      their climate denied; they coveted the works of art, which they
      were too lazy to imitate and too indigent to purchase; the
      Varangian princes unfurled the banners of piratical adventure,
      and their bravest soldiers were drawn from the nations that dwelt
      in the northern isles of the ocean. 57 The image of their naval
      armaments was revived in the last century, in the fleets of the
      Cossacks, which issued from the Borysthenes, to navigate the same
      seas for a similar purpose. 58 The Greek appellation of monoxyla,
      or single canoes, might justly be applied to the bottom of their
      vessels. It was scooped out of the long stem of a beech or
      willow, but the slight and narrow foundation was raised and
      continued on either side with planks, till it attained the length
      of sixty, and the height of about twelve, feet. These boats were
      built without a deck, but with two rudders and a mast; to move
      with sails and oars; and to contain from forty to seventy men,
      with their arms, and provisions of fresh water and salt fish. The
      first trial of the Russians was made with two hundred boats; but
      when the national force was exerted, they might arm against
      Constantinople a thousand or twelve hundred vessels. Their fleet
      was not much inferior to the royal navy of Agamemnon, but it was
      magnified in the eyes of fear to ten or fifteen times the real
      proportion of its strength and numbers. Had the Greek emperors
      been endowed with foresight to discern, and vigor to prevent,
      perhaps they might have sealed with a maritime force the mouth of
      the Borysthenes. Their indolence abandoned the coast of Anatolia
      to the calamities of a piratical war, which, after an interval of
      six hundred years, again infested the Euxine; but as long as the
      capital was respected, the sufferings of a distant province
      escaped the notice both of the prince and the historian. The
      storm which had swept along from the Phasis and Trebizond, at
      length burst on the Bosphorus of Thrace; a strait of fifteen
      miles, in which the rude vessels of the Russians might have been
      stopped and destroyed by a more skilful adversary. In their first
      enterprise 59 under the princes of Kiow, they passed without
      opposition, and occupied the port of Constantinople in the
      absence of the emperor Michael, the son of Theophilus. Through a
      crowd of perils, he landed at the palace-stairs, and immediately
      repaired to a church of the Virgin Mary. 60 By the advice of the
      patriarch, her garment, a precious relic, was drawn from the
      sanctuary and dipped in the sea; and a seasonable tempest, which
      determined the retreat of the Russians, was devoutly ascribed to
      the mother of God. 61 The silence of the Greeks may inspire some
      doubt of the truth, or at least of the importance, of the second
      attempt by Oleg, the guardian of the sons of Ruric. 62 A strong
      barrier of arms and fortifications defended the Bosphorus: they
      were eluded by the usual expedient of drawing the boats over the
      isthmus; and this simple operation is described in the national
      chronicles, as if the Russian fleet had sailed over dry land with
      a brisk and favorable gale. The leader of the third armament,
      Igor, the son of Ruric, had chosen a moment of weakness and
      decay, when the naval powers of the empire were employed against
      the Saracens. But if courage be not wanting, the instruments of
      defence are seldom deficient. Fifteen broken and decayed galleys
      were boldly launched against the enemy; but instead of the single
      tube of Greek fire usually planted on the prow, the sides and
      stern of each vessel were abundantly supplied with that liquid
      combustible. The engineers were dexterous; the weather was
      propitious; many thousand Russians, who chose rather to be
      drowned than burnt, leaped into the sea; and those who escaped to
      the Thracian shore were inhumanly slaughtered by the peasants and
      soldiers. Yet one third of the canoes escaped into shallow water;
      and the next spring Igor was again prepared to retrieve his
      disgrace and claim his revenge. 63 After a long peace, Jaroslaus,
      the great grandson of Igor, resumed the same project of a naval
      invasion. A fleet, under the command of his son, was repulsed at
      the entrance of the Bosphorus by the same artificial flames. But
      in the rashness of pursuit, the vanguard of the Greeks was
      encompassed by an irresistible multitude of boats and men; their
      provision of fire was probably exhausted; and twenty-four galleys
      were either taken, sunk, or destroyed. 64

      Yet the threats or calamities of a Russian war were more
      frequently diverted by treaty than by arms. In these naval
      hostilities, every disadvantage was on the side of the Greeks;
      their savage enemy afforded no mercy: his poverty promised no
      spoil; his impenetrable retreat deprived the conqueror of the
      hopes of revenge; and the pride or weakness of empire indulged an
      opinion, that no honor could be gained or lost in the intercourse
      with Barbarians. At first their demands were high and
      inadmissible, three pounds of gold for each soldier or mariner of
      the fleet: the Russian youth adhered to the design of conquest
      and glory; but the counsels of moderation were recommended by the
      hoary sages. “Be content,” they said, “with the liberal offers of
      Caesar; is it not far better to obtain without a combat the
      possession of gold, silver, silks, and all the objects of our
      desires? Are we sure of victory? Can we conclude a treaty with
      the sea? We do not tread on the land; we float on the abyss of
      water, and a common death hangs over our heads.” 65 The memory of
      these Arctic fleets that seemed to descend from the polar circle
      left deep impression of terror on the Imperial city. By the
      vulgar of every rank, it was asserted and believed, that an
      equestrian statue in the square of Taurus was secretly inscribed
      with a prophecy, how the Russians, in the last days, should
      become masters of Constantinople. 66 In our own time, a Russian
      armament, instead of sailing from the Borysthenes, has
      circumnavigated the continent of Europe; and the Turkish capital
      has been threatened by a squadron of strong and lofty ships of
      war, each of which, with its naval science and thundering
      artillery, could have sunk or scattered a hundred canoes, such as
      those of their ancestors. Perhaps the present generation may yet
      behold the accomplishment of the prediction, of a rare
      prediction, of which the style is unambiguous and the date
      unquestionable.

      By land the Russians were less formidable than by sea; and as
      they fought for the most part on foot, their irregular legions
      must often have been broken and overthrown by the cavalry of the
      Scythian hordes. Yet their growing towns, however slight and
      imperfect, presented a shelter to the subject, and a barrier to
      the enemy: the monarchy of Kiow, till a fatal partition, assumed
      the dominion of the North; and the nations from the Volga to the
      Danube were subdued or repelled by the arms of Swatoslaus, 67 the
      son of Igor, the son of Oleg, the son of Ruric. The vigor of his
      mind and body was fortified by the hardships of a military and
      savage life. Wrapped in a bear-skin, Swatoslaus usually slept on
      the ground, his head reclining on a saddle; his diet was coarse
      and frugal, and, like the heroes of Homer, 68 his meat (it was
      often horse-flesh) was broiled or roasted on the coals. The
      exercise of war gave stability and discipline to his army; and it
      may be presumed, that no soldier was permitted to transcend the
      luxury of his chief. By an embassy from Nicephorus, the Greek
      emperor, he was moved to undertake the conquest of Bulgaria; and
      a gift of fifteen hundred pounds of gold was laid at his feet to
      defray the expense, or reward the toils, of the expedition. An
      army of sixty thousand men was assembled and embarked; they
      sailed from the Borysthenes to the Danube; their landing was
      effected on the Maesian shore; and, after a sharp encounter, the
      swords of the Russians prevailed against the arrows of the
      Bulgarian horse. The vanquished king sunk into the grave; his
      children were made captive; and his dominions, as far as Mount
      Haemus, were subdued or ravaged by the northern invaders. But
      instead of relinquishing his prey, and performing his
      engagements, the Varangian prince was more disposed to advance
      than to retire; and, had his ambition been crowned with success,
      the seat of empire in that early period might have been
      transferred to a more temperate and fruitful climate. Swatoslaus
      enjoyed and acknowledged the advantages of his new position, in
      which he could unite, by exchange or rapine, the various
      productions of the earth. By an easy navigation he might draw
      from Russia the native commodities of furs, wax, and hydromed:
      Hungary supplied him with a breed of horses and the spoils of the
      West; and Greece abounded with gold, silver, and the foreign
      luxuries, which his poverty had affected to disdain. The bands of
      Patzinacites, Chozars, and Turks, repaired to the standard of
      victory; and the ambassador of Nicephorus betrayed his trust,
      assumed the purple, and promised to share with his new allies the
      treasures of the Eastern world. From the banks of the Danube the
      Russian prince pursued his march as far as Adrianople; a formal
      summons to evacuate the Roman province was dismissed with
      contempt; and Swatoslaus fiercely replied, that Constantinople
      might soon expect the presence of an enemy and a master.

      harmonious—a dead language can seldom appear low or familiar; and

      amused with the primitive manners of antiquity.]

      Nicephorus could no longer expel the mischief which he had
      introduced; but his throne and wife were inherited by John
      Zimisces, 69 who, in a diminutive body, possessed the spirit and
      abilities of a hero. The first victory of his lieutenants
      deprived the Russians of their foreign allies, twenty thousand of
      whom were either destroyed by the sword, or provoked to revolt,
      or tempted to desert. Thrace was delivered, but seventy thousand
      Barbarians were still in arms; and the legions that had been
      recalled from the new conquests of Syria, prepared, with the
      return of the spring, to march under the banners of a warlike
      prince, who declared himself the friend and avenger of the
      injured Bulgaria. The passes of Mount Haemus had been left
      unguarded; they were instantly occupied; the Roman vanguard was
      formed of the immortals, (a proud imitation of the Persian
      style;) the emperor led the main body of ten thousand five
      hundred foot; and the rest of his forces followed in slow and
      cautious array, with the baggage and military engines. The first
      exploit of Zimisces was the reduction of Marcianopolis, or
      Peristhlaba, 70 in two days; the trumpets sounded; the walls were
      scaled; eight thousand five hundred Russians were put to the
      sword; and the sons of the Bulgarian king were rescued from an
      ignominious prison, and invested with a nominal diadem. After
      these repeated losses, Swatoslaus retired to the strong post of
      Drista, on the banks of the Danube, and was pursued by an enemy
      who alternately employed the arms of celerity and delay. The
      Byzantine galleys ascended the river, the legions completed a
      line of circumvallation; and the Russian prince was encompassed,
      assaulted, and famished, in the fortifications of the camp and
      city. Many deeds of valor were performed; several desperate
      sallies were attempted; nor was it till after a siege of
      sixty-five days that Swatoslaus yielded to his adverse fortune.
      The liberal terms which he obtained announce the prudence of the
      victor, who respected the valor, and apprehended the despair, of
      an unconquered mind. The great duke of Russia bound himself, by
      solemn imprecations, to relinquish all hostile designs; a safe
      passage was opened for his return; the liberty of trade and
      navigation was restored; a measure of corn was distributed to
      each of his soldiers; and the allowance of twenty-two thousand
      measures attests the loss and the remnant of the Barbarians.
      After a painful voyage, they again reached the mouth of the
      Borysthenes; but their provisions were exhausted; the season was
      unfavorable; they passed the winter on the ice; and, before they
      could prosecute their march, Swatoslaus was surprised and
      oppressed by the neighboring tribes with whom the Greeks
      entertained a perpetual and useful correspondence. 71 Far
      different was the return of Zimisces, who was received in his
      capital like Camillus or Marius, the saviors of ancient Rome. But
      the merit of the victory was attributed by the pious emperor to
      the mother of God; and the image of the Virgin Mary, with the
      divine infant in her arms, was placed on a triumphal car, adorned
      with the spoils of war, and the ensigns of Bulgarian royalty.
      Zimisces made his public entry on horseback; the diadem on his
      head, a crown of laurel in his hand; and Constantinople was
      astonished to applaud the martial virtues of her sovereign. 72

      Photius of Constantinople, a patriarch, whose ambition was equal
      to his curiosity, congratulates himself and the Greek church on
      the conversion of the Russians. 73 Those fierce and bloody
      Barbarians had been persuaded, by the voice of reason and
      religion, to acknowledge Jesus for their God, the Christian
      missionaries for their teachers, and the Romans for their friends
      and brethren. His triumph was transient and premature. In the
      various fortune of their piratical adventures, some Russian
      chiefs might allow themselves to be sprinkled with the waters of
      baptism; and a Greek bishop, with the name of metropolitan, might
      administer the sacraments in the church of Kiow, to a
      congregation of slaves and natives. But the seed of the gospel
      was sown on a barren soil: many were the apostates, the converts
      were few; and the baptism of Olga may be fixed as the aera of
      Russian Christianity. 74 A female, perhaps of the basest origin,
      who could revenge the death, and assume the sceptre, of her
      husband Igor, must have been endowed with those active virtues
      which command the fear and obedience of Barbarians. In a moment
      of foreign and domestic peace, she sailed from Kiow to
      Constantinople; and the emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus has
      described, with minute diligence, the ceremonial of her reception
      in his capital and palace. The steps, the titles, the
      salutations, the banquet, the presents, were exquisitely adjusted
      to gratify the vanity of the stranger, with due reverence to the
      superior majesty of the purple. 75 In the sacrament of baptism,
      she received the venerable name of the empress Helena; and her
      conversion might be preceded or followed by her uncle, two
      interpreters, sixteen damsels of a higher, and eighteen of a
      lower rank, twenty-two domestics or ministers, and forty-four
      Russian merchants, who composed the retinue of the great princess
      Olga. After her return to Kiow and Novogorod, she firmly
      persisted in her new religion; but her labors in the propagation
      of the gospel were not crowned with success; and both her family
      and nation adhered with obstinacy or indifference to the gods of
      their fathers. Her son Swatoslaus was apprehensive of the scorn
      and ridicule of his companions; and her grandson Wolodomir
      devoted his youthful zeal to multiply and decorate the monuments
      of ancient worship. The savage deities of the North were still
      propitiated with human sacrifices: in the choice of the victim, a
      citizen was preferred to a stranger, a Christian to an idolater;
      and the father, who defended his son from the sacerdotal knife,
      was involved in the same doom by the rage of a fanatic tumult.
      Yet the lessons and example of the pious Olga had made a deep,
      though secret, impression in the minds of the prince and people:
      the Greek missionaries continued to preach, to dispute, and to
      baptize: and the ambassadors or merchants of Russia compared the
      idolatry of the woods with the elegant superstition of
      Constantinople. They had gazed with admiration on the dome of St.
      Sophia: the lively pictures of saints and martyrs, the riches of
      the altar, the number and vestments of the priests, the pomp and
      order of the ceremonies; they were edified by the alternate
      succession of devout silence and harmonious song; nor was it
      difficult to persuade them, that a choir of angels descended each
      day from heaven to join in the devotion of the Christians. 76 But
      the conversion of Wolodomir was determined, or hastened, by his
      desire of a Roman bride. At the same time, and in the city of
      Cherson, the rites of baptism and marriage were celebrated by the
      Christian pontiff: the city he restored to the emperor Basil, the
      brother of his spouse; but the brazen gates were transported, as
      it is said, to Novogorod, and erected before the first church as
      a trophy of his victory and faith. 77 At his despotic command,
      Peround, the god of thunder, whom he had so long adored, was
      dragged through the streets of Kiow; and twelve sturdy Barbarians
      battered with clubs the misshapen image, which was indignantly
      cast into the waters of the Borysthenes. The edict of Wolodomir
      had proclaimed, that all who should refuse the rites of baptism
      would be treated as the enemies of God and their prince; and the
      rivers were instantly filled with many thousands of obedient
      Russians, who acquiesced in the truth and excellence of a
      doctrine which had been embraced by the great duke and his
      boyars. In the next generation, the relics of Paganism were
      finally extirpated; but as the two brothers of Wolodomir had died
      without baptism, their bones were taken from the grave, and
      sanctified by an irregular and posthumous sacrament.

      preserved at Novogorod. Yet an observing traveller transports the
      brazen gates from Magdeburgh in Germany, (Coxe’s Travels into
      Russia, &c., vol. i. p. 452;) and quotes an inscription, which
      seems to justify his opinion. The modern reader must not confound
      this old Cherson of the Tauric or Crimaean peninsula, with a new
      city of the same name, which has arisen near the mouth of the

      the empress of Russia with the emperor of the West.]

      In the ninth, tenth, and eleventh centuries of the Christian
      aera, the reign of the gospel and of the church was extended over
      Bulgaria, Hungary, Bohemia, Saxony, Denmark, Norway, Sweden,
      Poland, and Russia. 78 The triumphs of apostolic zeal were
      repeated in the iron age of Christianity; and the northern and
      eastern regions of Europe submitted to a religion, more different
      in theory than in practice, from the worship of their native
      idols. A laudable ambition excited the monks both of Germany and
      Greece, to visit the tents and huts of the Barbarians: poverty,
      hardships, and dangers, were the lot of the first missionaries;
      their courage was active and patient; their motive pure and
      meritorious; their present reward consisted in the testimony of
      their conscience and the respect of a grateful people; but the
      fruitful harvest of their toils was inherited and enjoyed by the
      proud and wealthy prelates of succeeding times. The first
      conversions were free and spontaneous: a holy life and an
      eloquent tongue were the only arms of the missionaries; but the
      domestic fables of the Pagans were silenced by the miracles and
      visions of the strangers; and the favorable temper of the chiefs
      was accelerated by the dictates of vanity and interest. The
      leaders of nations, who were saluted with the titles of kings and
      saints, 79 held it lawful and pious to impose the Catholic faith
      on their subjects and neighbors; the coast of the Baltic, from
      Holstein to the Gulf of Finland, was invaded under the standard
      of the cross; and the reign of idolatry was closed by the
      conversion of Lithuania in the fourteenth century. Yet truth and
      candor must acknowledge, that the conversion of the North
      imparted many temporal benefits both to the old and the new
      Christians. The rage of war, inherent to the human species, could
      not be healed by the evangelic precepts of charity and peace; and
      the ambition of Catholic princes has renewed in every age the
      calamities of hostile contention. But the admission of the
      Barbarians into the pale of civil and ecclesiastical society
      delivered Europe from the depredations, by sea and land, of the
      Normans, the Hungarians, and the Russians, who learned to spare
      their brethren and cultivate their possessions. 80 The
      establishment of law and order was promoted by the influence of
      the clergy; and the rudiments of art and science were introduced
      into the savage countries of the globe. The liberal piety of the
      Russian princes engaged in their service the most skilful of the
      Greeks, to decorate the cities and instruct the inhabitants: the
      dome and the paintings of St. Sophia were rudely copied in the
      churches of Kiow and Novogorod: the writings of the fathers were
      translated into the Sclavonic idiom; and three hundred noble
      youths were invited or compelled to attend the lessons of the
      college of Jaroslaus. It should appear that Russia might have
      derived an early and rapid improvement from her peculiar
      connection with the church and state of Constantinople, which at
      that age so justly despised the ignorance of the Latins. But the
      Byzantine nation was servile, solitary, and verging to a hasty
      decline: after the fall of Kiow, the navigation of the
      Borysthenes was forgotten; the great princes of Wolodomir and
      Moscow were separated from the sea and Christendom; and the
      divided monarchy was oppressed by the ignominy and blindness of
      Tartar servitude. 81 The Sclavonic and Scandinavian kingdoms,
      which had been converted by the Latin missionaries, were exposed,
      it is true, to the spiritual jurisdiction and temporal claims of
      the popes; 82 but they were united in language and religious
      worship, with each other, and with Rome; they imbibed the free
      and generous spirit of the European republic, and gradually
      shared the light of knowledge which arose on the western world.
