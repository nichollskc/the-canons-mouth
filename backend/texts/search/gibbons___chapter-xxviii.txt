Chapter XXVIII: Destruction Of Paganism.—Part I.

     Final Destruction Of Paganism.—Introduction Of The Worship Of
     Saints, And Relics, Among The Christians.

      The ruin of Paganism, in the age of Theodosius, is perhaps the
      only example of the total extirpation of any ancient and popular
      superstition; and may therefore deserve to be considered as a
      singular event in the history of the human mind. The Christians,
      more especially the clergy, had impatiently supported the prudent
      delays of Constantine, and the equal toleration of the elder
      Valentinian; nor could they deem their conquest perfect or
      secure, as long as their adversaries were permitted to exist. The
      influence which Ambrose and his brethren had acquired over the
      youth of Gratian, and the piety of Theodosius, was employed to
      infuse the maxims of persecution into the breasts of their
      Imperial proselytes. Two specious principles of religious
      jurisprudence were established, from whence they deduced a direct
      and rigorous conclusion, against the subjects of the empire who
      still adhered to the ceremonies of their ancestors: that the
      magistrate is, in some measure, guilty of the crimes which he
      neglects to prohibit, or to punish; and, that the idolatrous
      worship of fabulous deities, and real daemons, is the most
      abominable crime against the supreme majesty of the Creator. The
      laws of Moses, and the examples of Jewish history, 1 were
      hastily, perhaps erroneously, applied, by the clergy, to the mild
      and universal reign of Christianity. 2 The zeal of the emperors
      was excited to vindicate their own honor, and that of the Deity:
      and the temples of the Roman world were subverted, about sixty
      years after the conversion of Constantine.

      expressly praises and recommends the zeal of Josiah in the
      destruction of idolatry The language of Julius Firmicus Maternus
      on the same subject (de Errore Profan. Relig. p. 467, edit.
      Gronov.) is piously inhuman. Nec filio jubet (the Mosaic Law)
      parci, nec fratri, et per amatam conjugera gladium vindicem
      ducit, &c.]

      2 (return) [ Bayle (tom. ii. p. 406, in his Commentaire
      Philosophique) justifies, and limits, these intolerant laws by
      the temporal reign of Jehovah over the Jews. The attempt is
      laudable.]

      From the age of Numa to the reign of Gratian, the Romans
      preserved the regular succession of the several colleges of the
      sacerdotal order. 3 Fifteen Pontiffs exercised their supreme
      jurisdiction over all things, and persons, that were consecrated
      to the service of the gods; and the various questions which
      perpetually arose in a loose and traditionary system, were
      submitted to the judgment of their holy tribunal. Fifteen grave
      and learned Augurs observed the face of the heavens, and
      prescribed the actions of heroes, according to the flight of
      birds. Fifteen keepers of the Sibylline books (their name of
      Quindecemvirs was derived from their number) occasionally
      consulted the history of future, and, as it should seem, of
      contingent, events. Six Vestals devoted their virginity to the
      guard of the sacred fire, and of the unknown pledges of the
      duration of Rome; which no mortal had been suffered to behold
      with impunity. 4 Seven Epulos prepared the table of the gods,
      conducted the solemn procession, and regulated the ceremonies of
      the annual festival. The three Flamens of Jupiter, of Mars, and
      of Quirinus, were considered as the peculiar ministers of the
      three most powerful deities, who watched over the fate of Rome
      and of the universe. The King of the Sacrifices represented the
      person of Numa, and of his successors, in the religious
      functions, which could be performed only by royal hands. The
      confraternities of the Salians, the Lupercals, &c., practised
      such rites as might extort a smile of contempt from every
      reasonable man, with a lively confidence of recommending
      themselves to the favor of the immortal gods. The authority,
      which the Roman priests had formerly obtained in the counsels of
      the republic, was gradually abolished by the establishment of
      monarchy, and the removal of the seat of empire. But the dignity
      of their sacred character was still protected by the laws, and
      manners of their country; and they still continued, more
      especially the college of pontiffs, to exercise in the capital,
      and sometimes in the provinces, the rights of their
      ecclesiastical and civil jurisdiction. Their robes of purple,
      chariotz of state, and sumptuous entertainments, attracted the
      admiration of the people; and they received, from the consecrated
      lands, and the public revenue, an ample stipend, which liberally
      supported the splendor of the priesthood, and all the expenses of
      the religious worship of the state. As the service of the altar
      was not incompatible with the command of armies, the Romans,
      after their consulships and triumphs, aspired to the place of
      pontiff, or of augur; the seats of Cicero 5 and Pompey were
      filled, in the fourth century, by the most illustrious members of
      the senate; and the dignity of their birth reflected additional
      splendor on their sacerdotal character. The fifteen priests, who
      composed the college of pontiffs, enjoyed a more distinguished
      rank as the companions of their sovereign; and the Christian
      emperors condescended to accept the robe and ensigns, which were
      appropriated to the office of supreme pontiff. But when Gratian
      ascended the throne, more scrupulous or more enlightened, he
      sternly rejected those profane symbols; 6 applied to the service
      of the state, or of the church, the revenues of the priests and
      vestals; abolished their honors and immunities; and dissolved the
      ancient fabric of Roman superstition, which was supported by the
      opinions and habits of eleven hundred years. Paganism was still
      the constitutional religion of the senate. The hall, or temple,
      in which they assembled, was adorned by the statue and altar of
      Victory; 7 a majestic female standing on a globe, with flowing
      garments, expanded wings, and a crown of laurel in her
      outstretched hand. 8 The senators were sworn on the altar of the
      goddess to observe the laws of the emperor and of the empire: and
      a solemn offering of wine and incense was the ordinary prelude of
      their public deliberations. 9 The removal of this ancient
      monument was the only injury which Constantius had offered to the
      superstition of the Romans. The altar of Victory was again
      restored by Julian, tolerated by Valentinian, and once more
      banished from the senate by the zeal of Gratian. 10 But the
      emperor yet spared the statues of the gods which were exposed to
      the public veneration: four hundred and twenty-four temples, or
      chapels, still remained to satisfy the devotion of the people;
      and in every quarter of Rome the delicacy of the Christians was
      offended by the fumes of idolatrous sacrifice. 11

      Roman antiquary.]

      4 (return) [ These mystic, and perhaps imaginary, symbols have
      given birth to various fables and conjectures. It seems probable,
      that the Palladium was a small statue (three cubits and a half
      high) of Minerva, with a lance and distaff; that it was usually
      enclosed in a seria, or barrel; and that a similar barrel was
      placed by its side to disconcert curiosity, or sacrilege. See
      Mezeriac (Comment. sur les Epitres d’Ovide, tom i. p. 60—66) and
      Lipsius, (tom. iii. p. 610 de Vesta, &c. c 10.)]

      5 (return) [ Cicero frankly (ad Atticum, l. ii. Epist. 5) or
      indirectly (ad Familiar. l. xv. Epist. 4) confesses that the
      Augurate is the supreme object of his wishes. Pliny is proud to
      tread in the footsteps of Cicero, (l. iv. Epist. 8,) and the
      chain of tradition might be continued from history and marbles.]

      foolish pun about Pontifex and Maximus.]

      7 (return) [ This statue was transported from Tarentum to Rome,
      placed in the Curia Julia by Caesar, and decorated by Augustus
      with the spoils of Egypt.]

      8 (return) [ Prudentius (l. ii. in initio) has drawn a very
      awkward portrait of Victory; but the curious reader will obtain
      more satisfaction from Montfaucon’s Antiquities, (tom. i. p.

      Pliny’s Panegyric.]

      10 (return) [ These facts are mutually allowed by the two
      advocates, Symmachus and Ambrose.]

      11 (return) [ The Notitia Urbis, more recent than Constantine,
      does not find one Christian church worthy to be named among the
      edifices of the city. Ambrose (tom. ii. Epist. xvii. p. 825)
      deplores the public scandals of Rome, which continually offended
      the eyes, the ears, and the nostrils of the faithful.]

      But the Christians formed the least numerous party in the senate
      of Rome: 12 and it was only by their absence, that they could
      express their dissent from the legal, though profane, acts of a
      Pagan majority. In that assembly, the dying embers of freedom
      were, for a moment, revived and inflamed by the breath of
      fanaticism. Four respectable deputations were successively voted
      to the Imperial court, 13 to represent the grievances of the
      priesthood and the senate, and to solicit the restoration of the
      altar of Victory. The conduct of this important business was
      intrusted to the eloquent Symmachus, 14 a wealthy and noble
      senator, who united the sacred characters of pontiff and augur
      with the civil dignities of proconsul of Africa and præfect of
      the city. The breast of Symmachus was animated by the warmest
      zeal for the cause of expiring Paganism; and his religious
      antagonists lamented the abuse of his genius, and the inefficacy
      of his moral virtues. 15 The orator, whose petition is extant to
      the emperor Valentinian, was conscious of the difficulty and
      danger of the office which he had assumed. He cautiously avoids
      every topic which might appear to reflect on the religion of his
      sovereign; humbly declares, that prayers and entreaties are his
      only arms; and artfully draws his arguments from the schools of
      rhetoric, rather than from those of philosophy. Symmachus
      endeavors to seduce the imagination of a young prince, by
      displaying the attributes of the goddess of victory; he
      insinuates, that the confiscation of the revenues, which were
      consecrated to the service of the gods, was a measure unworthy of
      his liberal and disinterested character; and he maintains, that
      the Roman sacrifices would be deprived of their force and energy,
      if they were no longer celebrated at the expense, as well as in
      the name, of the republic. Even scepticism is made to supply an
      apology for superstition. The great and incomprehensible secret
      of the universe eludes the inquiry of man. Where reason cannot
      instruct, custom may be permitted to guide; and every nation
      seems to consult the dictates of prudence, by a faithful
      attachment to those rites and opinions, which have received the
      sanction of ages. If those ages have been crowned with glory and
      prosperity, if the devout people have frequently obtained the
      blessings which they have solicited at the altars of the gods, it
      must appear still more advisable to persist in the same salutary
      practice; and not to risk the unknown perils that may attend any
      rash innovations. The test of antiquity and success was applied
      with singular advantage to the religion of Numa; and Rome
      herself, the celestial genius that presided over the fates of the
      city, is introduced by the orator to plead her own cause before
      the tribunal of the emperors. “Most excellent princes,” says the
      venerable matron, “fathers of your country! pity and respect my
      age, which has hitherto flowed in an uninterrupted course of
      piety. Since I do not repent, permit me to continue in the
      practice of my ancient rites. Since I am born free, allow me to
      enjoy my domestic institutions. This religion has reduced the
      world under my laws. These rites have repelled Hannibal from the
      city, and the Gauls from the Capitol. Were my gray hairs reserved
      for such intolerable disgrace? I am ignorant of the new system
      that I am required to adopt; but I am well assured, that the
      correction of old age is always an ungrateful and ignominious
      office.” 16 The fears of the people supplied what the discretion
      of the orator had suppressed; and the calamities, which
      afflicted, or threatened, the declining empire, were unanimously
      imputed, by the Pagans, to the new religion of Christ and of
      Constantine.

      12 (return) [ Ambrose repeatedly affirms, in contradiction to
      common sense (Moyle’s Works, vol. ii. p. 147,) that the
      Christians had a majority in the senate.]

      13 (return) [ The first (A.D. 382) to Gratian, who refused them
      audience; the second (A.D. 384) to Valentinian, when the field
      was disputed by Symmachus and Ambrose; the third (A.D. 388) to
      Theodosius; and the fourth (A.D. 392) to Valentinian. Lardner
      (Heathen Testimonies, vol. iv. p. 372-399) fairly represents the
      whole transaction.]

      14 (return) [ Symmachus, who was invested with all the civil and
      sacerdotal honors, represented the emperor under the two
      characters of Pontifex Maximus, and Princeps Senatus. See the
      proud inscription at the head of his works. * Note: Mr. Beugnot
      has made it doubtful whether Symmachus was more than Pontifex
      Major. Destruction du Paganisme, vol. i. p. 459.—M.]

      15 (return) [ As if any one, says Prudentius (in Symmach. i. 639)
      should dig in the mud with an instrument of gold and ivory. Even
      saints, and polemic saints, treat this adversary with respect and
      civility.]

      16 (return) [ See the fifty-fourth Epistle of the tenth book of
      Symmachus. In the form and disposition of his ten books of
      Epistles, he imitated the younger Pliny; whose rich and florid
      style he was supposed, by his friends, to equal or excel,
      (Macrob. Saturnal. l. v. c. i.) But the luxcriancy of Symmachus
      consists of barren leaves, without fruits, and even without
      flowers. Few facts, and few sentiments, can be extracted from his
      verbose correspondence.]

      But the hopes of Symmachus were repeatedly baffled by the firm
      and dexterous opposition of the archbishop of Milan, who
      fortified the emperors against the fallacious eloquence of the
      advocate of Rome. In this controversy, Ambrose condescends to
      speak the language of a philosopher, and to ask, with some
      contempt, why it should be thought necessary to introduce an
      imaginary and invisible power, as the cause of those victories,
      which were sufficiently explained by the valor and discipline of
      the legions. He justly derides the absurd reverence for
      antiquity, which could only tend to discourage the improvements
      of art, and to replunge the human race into their original
      barbarism. From thence, gradually rising to a more lofty and
      theological tone, he pronounces, that Christianity alone is the
      doctrine of truth and salvation; and that every mode of
      Polytheism conducts its deluded votaries, through the paths of
      error, to the abyss of eternal perdition. 17 Arguments like
      these, when they were suggested by a favorite bishop, had power
      to prevent the restoration of the altar of Victory; but the same
      arguments fell, with much more energy and effect, from the mouth
      of a conqueror; and the gods of antiquity were dragged in triumph
      at the chariot-wheels of Theodosius. 18 In a full meeting of the
      senate, the emperor proposed, according to the forms of the
      republic, the important question, Whether the worship of Jupiter,
      or that of Christ, should be the religion of the Romans. 1811 The
      liberty of suffrages, which he affected to allow, was destroyed
      by the hopes and fears that his presence inspired; and the
      arbitrary exile of Symmachus was a recent admonition, that it
      might be dangerous to oppose the wishes of the monarch. On a
      regular division of the senate, Jupiter was condemned and
      degraded by the sense of a very large majority; and it is rather
      surprising, that any members should be found bold enough to
      declare, by their speeches and votes, that they were still
      attached to the interest of an abdicated deity. 19 The hasty
      conversion of the senate must be attributed either to
      supernatural or to sordid motives; and many of these reluctant
      proselytes betrayed, on every favorable occasion, their secret
      disposition to throw aside the mask of odious dissimulation. But
      they were gradually fixed in the new religion, as the cause of
      the ancient became more hopeless; they yielded to the authority
      of the emperor, to the fashion of the times, and to the
      entreaties of their wives and children, 20 who were instigated
      and governed by the clergy of Rome and the monks of the East. The
      edifying example of the Anician family was soon imitated by the
      rest of the nobility: the Bassi, the Paullini, the Gracchi,
      embraced the Christian religion; and “the luminaries of the
      world, the venerable assembly of Catos (such are the high-flown
      expressions of Prudentius) were impatient to strip themselves of
      their pontifical garment; to cast the skin of the old serpent; to
      assume the snowy robes of baptismal innocence, and to humble the
      pride of the consular fasces before tombs of the martyrs.” 21 The
      citizens, who subsisted by their own industry, and the populace,
      who were supported by the public liberality, filled the churches
      of the Lateran, and Vatican, with an incessant throng of devout
      proselytes. The decrees of the senate, which proscribed the
      worship of idols, were ratified by the general consent of the
      Romans; 22 the splendor of the Capitol was defaced, and the
      solitary temples were abandoned to ruin and contempt. 23 Rome
      submitted to the yoke of the Gospel; and the vanquished provinces
      had not yet lost their reverence for the name and authority of
      Rome. 2311

      17 (return) [ See Ambrose, (tom. ii. Epist. xvii. xviii. p.
      825-833.) The former of these epistles is a short caution; the
      latter is a formal reply of the petition or libel of Symmachus.
      The same ideas are more copiously expressed in the poetry, if it
      may deserve that name, of Prudentius; who composed his two books
      against Symmachus (A.D. 404) while that senator was still alive.
      It is whimsical enough that Montesquieu (Considerations, &c. c.
      xix. tom. iii. p. 487) should overlook the two professed
      antagonists of Symmachus, and amuse himself with descanting on
      the more remote and indirect confutations of Orosius, St.
      Augustin, and Salvian.]

      18 (return) [ See Prudentius (in Symmach. l. i. 545, &c.) The
      Christian agrees with the Pagan Zosimus (l. iv. p. 283) in
      placing this visit of Theodosius after the second civil war,
      gemini bis victor caede Tyranni, (l. i. 410.) But the time and
      circumstances are better suited to his first triumph.]

      1811 (return) [ M. Beugnot (in his Histoire de la Destruction du
      Paganisme en Occident, i. p. 483-488) questions, altogether, the
      truth of this statement. It is very remarkable that Zosimus and
      Prudentius concur in asserting the fact of the question being
      solemnly deliberated by the senate, though with directly opposite
      results. Zosimus declares that the majority of the assembly
      adhered to the ancient religion of Rome; Gibbon has adopted the
      authority of Prudentius, who, as a Latin writer, though a poet,
      deserves more credit than the Greek historian. Both concur in
      placing this scene after the second triumph of Theodosius; but it
      has been almost demonstrated (and Gibbon—see the preceding
      note—seems to have acknowledged this) by Pagi and Tillemont, that
      Theodosius did not visit Rome after the defeat of Eugenius. M.
      Beugnot urges, with much force, the improbability that the
      Christian emperor would submit such a question to the senate,
      whose authority was nearly obsolete, except on one occasion,
      which was almost hailed as an epoch in the restoration of her
      ancient privileges. The silence of Ambrose and of Jerom on an
      event so striking, and redounding so much to the honor of
      Christianity, is of considerable weight. M. Beugnot would ascribe
      the whole scene to the poetic imagination of Prudentius; but I
      must observe, that, however Prudentius is sometimes elevated by
      the grandeur of his subject to vivid and eloquent language, this
      flight of invention would be so much bolder and more vigorous
      than usual with this poet, that I cannot but suppose there must
      have been some foundation for the story, though it may have been
      exaggerated by the poet, or misrepresented by the historian.—M]

      19 (return) [ Prudentius, after proving that the sense of the
      senate is declared by a legal majority, proceeds to say, (609,
      &c.)—

     Adspice quam pleno subsellia nostra Senatu Decernant infame Jovis
     pulvinar, et omne Idolum longe purgata ex urbe fugandum, Qua vocat
     egregii sententia Principis, illuc Libera, cum pedibus, tum corde,
     frequentia transit.

      Zosimus ascribes to the conscript fathers a heathenish courage,
      which few of them are found to possess.]

      20 (return) [ Jerom specifies the pontiff Albinus, who was
      surrounded with such a believing family of children and
      grandchildren, as would have been sufficient to convert even
      Jupiter himself; an extraordinary proselyted (tom. i. ad Laetam,
      p. 54.)]

      21 (return) [

     Exultare Patres videas, pulcherrima mundi Lumina; Conciliumque
     senum gestire Catonum Candidiore toga niveum pietatis amictum
     Sumere; et exuvias deponere pontificales.

      The fancy of Prudentius is warmed and elevated by victory]

      22 (return) [ Prudentius, after he has described the conversion
      of the senate and people, asks, with some truth and confidence,

    Et dubitamus adhuc Romam, tibi, Christe, dicatam In leges transisse
    tuas?]

      23 (return) [ Jerom exults in the desolation of the Capitol, and
      the other temples of Rome, (tom. i. p. 54, tom. ii. p. 95.)]

      2311 (return) [ M. Beugnot is more correct in his general
      estimate of the measures enforced by Theodosius for the abolition
      of Paganism. He seized (according to Zosimus) the funds bestowed
      by the public for the expense of sacrifices. The public
      sacrifices ceased, not because they were positively prohibited,
      but because the public treasury would no longer bear the expense.
      The public and the private sacrifices in the provinces, which
      were not under the same regulations with those of the capital,
      continued to take place. In Rome itself, many pagan ceremonies,
      which were without sacrifice, remained in full force. The gods,
      therefore, were invoked, the temples were frequented, the
      pontificates inscribed, according to ancient usage, among the
      family titles of honor; and it cannot be asserted that idolatry
      was completely destroyed by Theodosius. See Beugnot, p. 491.—M.]




      Chapter XXVIII: Destruction Of Paganism.—Part II.

      The filial piety of the emperors themselves engaged them to
      proceed, with some caution and tenderness, in the reformation of
      the eternal city. Those absolute monarchs acted with less regard
      to the prejudices of the provincials. The pious labor which had
      been suspended near twenty years since the death of Constantius,
      24 was vigorously resumed, and finally accomplished, by the zeal
      of Theodosius. Whilst that warlike prince yet struggled with the
      Goths, not for the glory, but for the safety, of the republic, he
      ventured to offend a considerable party of his subjects, by some
      acts which might perhaps secure the protection of Heaven, but
      which must seem rash and unseasonable in the eye of human
      prudence. The success of his first experiments against the Pagans
      encouraged the pious emperor to reiterate and enforce his edicts
      of proscription: the same laws which had been originally
      published in the provinces of the East, were applied, after the
      defeat of Maximus, to the whole extent of the Western empire; and
      every victory of the orthodox Theodosius contributed to the
      triumph of the Christian and Catholic faith. 25 He attacked
      superstition in her most vital part, by prohibiting the use of
      sacrifices, which he declared to be criminal as well as infamous;
      and if the terms of his edicts more strictly condemned the
      impious curiosity which examined the entrails of the victim, 26
      every subsequent explanation tended to involve in the same guilt
      the general practice of immolation, which essentially constituted
      the religion of the Pagans. As the temples had been erected for
      the purpose of sacrifice, it was the duty of a benevolent prince
      to remove from his subjects the dangerous temptation of offending
      against the laws which he had enacted. A special commission was
      granted to Cynegius, the Prætorian præfect of the East, and
      afterwards to the counts Jovius and Gaudentius, two officers of
      distinguished rank in the West; by which they were directed to
      shut the temples, to seize or destroy the instruments of
      idolatry, to abolish the privileges of the priests, and to
      confiscate the consecrated property for the benefit of the
      emperor, of the church, or of the army. 27 Here the desolation
      might have stopped: and the naked edifices, which were no longer
      employed in the service of idolatry, might have been protected
      from the destructive rage of fanaticism. Many of those temples
      were the most splendid and beautiful monuments of Grecian
      architecture; and the emperor himself was interested not to
      deface the splendor of his own cities, or to diminish the value
      of his own possessions. Those stately edifices might be suffered
      to remain, as so many lasting trophies of the victory of Christ.
      In the decline of the arts they might be usefully converted into
      magazines, manufactures, or places of public assembly: and
      perhaps, when the walls of the temple had been sufficiently
      purified by holy rites, the worship of the true Deity might be
      allowed to expiate the ancient guilt of idolatry. But as long as
      they subsisted, the Pagans fondly cherished the secret hope, that
      an auspicious revolution, a second Julian, might again restore
      the altars of the gods: and the earnestness with which they
      addressed their unavailing prayers to the throne, 28 increased
      the zeal of the Christian reformers to extirpate, without mercy,
      the root of superstition. The laws of the emperors exhibit some
      symptoms of a milder disposition: 29 but their cold and languid
      efforts were insufficient to stem the torrent of enthusiasm and
      rapine, which was conducted, or rather impelled, by the spiritual
      rulers of the church. In Gaul, the holy Martin, bishop of Tours,
      30 marched at the head of his faithful monks to destroy the
      idols, the temples, and the consecrated trees of his extensive
      diocese; and, in the execution of this arduous task, the prudent
      reader will judge whether Martin was supported by the aid of
      miraculous powers, or of carnal weapons. In Syria, the divine and
      excellent Marcellus, 31 as he is styled by Theodoret, a bishop
      animated with apostolic fervor, resolved to level with the ground
      the stately temples within the diocese of Apamea. His attack was
      resisted by the skill and solidity with which the temple of
      Jupiter had been constructed. The building was seated on an
      eminence: on each of the four sides, the lofty roof was supported
      by fifteen massy columns, sixteen feet in circumference; and the
      large stone, of which they were composed, were firmly cemented
      with lead and iron. The force of the strongest and sharpest tools
      had been tried without effect. It was found necessary to
      undermine the foundations of the columns, which fell down as soon
      as the temporary wooden props had been consumed with fire; and
      the difficulties of the enterprise are described under the
      allegory of a black daemon, who retarded, though he could not
      defeat, the operations of the Christian engineers. Elated with
      victory, Marcellus took the field in person against the powers of
      darkness; a numerous troop of soldiers and gladiators marched
      under the episcopal banner, and he successively attacked the
      villages and country temples of the diocese of Apamea. Whenever
      any resistance or danger was apprehended, the champion of the
      faith, whose lameness would not allow him either to fight or fly,
      placed himself at a convenient distance, beyond the reach of
      darts. But this prudence was the occasion of his death: he was
      surprised and slain by a body of exasperated rustics; and the
      synod of the province pronounced, without hesitation, that the
      holy Marcellus had sacrificed his life in the cause of God. In
      the support of this cause, the monks, who rushed with tumultuous
      fury from the desert, distinguished themselves by their zeal and
      diligence. They deserved the enmity of the Pagans; and some of
      them might deserve the reproaches of avarice and intemperance; of
      avarice, which they gratified with holy plunder, and of
      intemperance, which they indulged at the expense of the people,
      who foolishly admired their tattered garments, loud psalmody, and
      artificial paleness. 32 A small number of temples was protected
      by the fears, the venality, the taste, or the prudence, of the
      civil and ecclesiastical governors. The temple of the Celestial
      Venus at Carthage, whose sacred precincts formed a circumference
      of two miles, was judiciously converted into a Christian church;
      33 and a similar consecration has preserved inviolate the
      majestic dome of the Pantheon at Rome. 34 But in almost every
      province of the Roman world, an army of fanatics, without
      authority, and without discipline, invaded the peaceful
      inhabitants; and the ruin of the fairest structures of antiquity
      still displays the ravages of those Barbarians, who alone had
      time and inclination to execute such laborious destruction.

      In this wide and various prospect of devastation, the spectator
      may distinguish the ruins of the temple of Serapis, at
      Alexandria. 35 Serapis does not appear to have been one of the
      native gods, or monsters, who sprung from the fruitful soil of
      superstitious Egypt. 36 The first of the Ptolemies had been
      commanded, by a dream, to import the mysterious stranger from the
      coast of Pontus, where he had been long adored by the inhabitants
      of Sinope; but his attributes and his reign were so imperfectly
      understood, that it became a subject of dispute, whether he
      represented the bright orb of day, or the gloomy monarch of the
      subterraneous regions. 37 The Egyptians, who were obstinately
      devoted to the religion of their fathers, refused to admit this
      foreign deity within the walls of their cities. 38 But the
      obsequious priests, who were seduced by the liberality of the
      Ptolemies, submitted, without resistance, to the power of the god
      of Pontus: an honorable and domestic genealogy was provided; and
      this fortunate usurper was introduced into the throne and bed of
      Osiris, 39 the husband of Isis, and the celestial monarch of
      Egypt. Alexandria, which claimed his peculiar protection, gloried
      in the name of the city of Serapis. His temple, 40 which rivalled
      the pride and magnificence of the Capitol, was erected on the
      spacious summit of an artificial mount, raised one hundred steps
      above the level of the adjacent parts of the city; and the
      interior cavity was strongly supported by arches, and distributed
      into vaults and subterraneous apartments. The consecrated
      buildings were surrounded by a quadrangular portico; the stately
      halls, and exquisite statues, displayed the triumph of the arts;
      and the treasures of ancient learning were preserved in the
      famous Alexandrian library, which had arisen with new splendor
      from its ashes. 41 After the edicts of Theodosius had severely
      prohibited the sacrifices of the Pagans, they were still
      tolerated in the city and temple of Serapis; and this singular
      indulgence was imprudently ascribed to the superstitious terrors
      of the Christians themselves; as if they had feared to abolish
      those ancient rites, which could alone secure the inundations of
      the Nile, the harvests of Egypt, and the subsistence of
      Constantinople. 42

      42 (return) [ Libanius (pro Templis, p. 21) indiscreetly provokes

      At that time 43 the archiepiscopal throne of Alexandria was
      filled by Theophilus, 44 the perpetual enemy of peace and virtue;
      a bold, bad man, whose hands were alternately polluted with gold
      and with blood. His pious indignation was excited by the honors
      of Serapis; and the insults which he offered to an ancient temple
      of Bacchus, 4411 convinced the Pagans that he meditated a more
      important and dangerous enterprise. In the tumultuous capital of
      Egypt, the slightest provocation was sufficient to inflame a
      civil war. The votaries of Serapis, whose strength and numbers
      were much inferior to those of their antagonists, rose in arms at
      the instigation of the philosopher Olympius, 45 who exhorted them
      to die in the defence of the altars of the gods. These Pagan
      fanatics fortified themselves in the temple, or rather fortress,
      of Serapis; repelled the besiegers by daring sallies, and a
      resolute defence; and, by the inhuman cruelties which they
      exercised on their Christian prisoners, obtained the last
      consolation of despair. The efforts of the prudent magistrate
      were usefully exerted for the establishment of a truce, till the
      answer of Theodosius should determine the fate of Serapis. The
      two parties assembled, without arms, in the principal square; and
      the Imperial rescript was publicly read. But when a sentence of
      destruction against the idols of Alexandria was pronounced, the
      Christians set up a shout of joy and exultation, whilst the
      unfortunate Pagans, whose fury had given way to consternation,
      retired with hasty and silent steps, and eluded, by their flight
      or obscurity, the resentment of their enemies. Theophilus
      proceeded to demolish the temple of Serapis, without any other
      difficulties, than those which he found in the weight and
      solidity of the materials: but these obstacles proved so
      insuperable, that he was obliged to leave the foundations; and to
      content himself with reducing the edifice itself to a heap of
      rubbish, a part of which was soon afterwards cleared away, to
      make room for a church, erected in honor of the Christian
      martyrs. The valuable library of Alexandria was pillaged or
      destroyed; and near twenty years afterwards, the appearance of
      the empty shelves excited the regret and indignation of every
      spectator, whose mind was not totally darkened by religious
      prejudice. 46 The compositions of ancient genius, so many of
      which have irretrievably perished, might surely have been
      excepted from the wreck of idolatry, for the amusement and
      instruction of succeeding ages; and either the zeal or the
      avarice of the archbishop, 47 might have been satiated with the
      rich spoils, which were the reward of his victory. While the
      images and vases of gold and silver were carefully melted, and
      those of a less valuable metal were contemptuously broken, and
      cast into the streets, Theophilus labored to expose the frauds
      and vices of the ministers of the idols; their dexterity in the
      management of the loadstone; their secret methods of introducing
      a human actor into a hollow statue; 4711 and their scandalous
      abuse of the confidence of devout husbands and unsuspecting
      females. 48 Charges like these may seem to deserve some degree of
      credit, as they are not repugnant to the crafty and interested
      spirit of superstition. But the same spirit is equally prone to
      the base practice of insulting and calumniating a fallen enemy;
      and our belief is naturally checked by the reflection, that it is
      much less difficult to invent a fictitious story, than to support
      a practical fraud. The colossal statue of Serapis 49 was involved
      in the ruin of his temple and religion. A great number of plates
      of different metals, artificially joined together, composed the
      majestic figure of the deity, who touched on either side the
      walls of the sanctuary. The aspect of Serapis, his sitting
      posture, and the sceptre, which he bore in his left hand, were
      extremely similar to the ordinary representations of Jupiter. He
      was distinguished from Jupiter by the basket, or bushel, which
      was placed on his head; and by the emblematic monster which he
      held in his right hand; the head and body of a serpent branching
      into three tails, which were again terminated by the triple heads
      of a dog, a lion, and a wolf. It was confidently affirmed, that
      if any impious hand should dare to violate the majesty of the
      god, the heavens and the earth would instantly return to their
      original chaos. An intrepid soldier, animated by zeal, and armed
      with a weighty battle-axe, ascended the ladder; and even the
      Christian multitude expected, with some anxiety, the event of the
      combat. 50 He aimed a vigorous stroke against the cheek of
      Serapis; the cheek fell to the ground; the thunder was still
      silent, and both the heavens and the earth continued to preserve
      their accustomed order and tranquillity. The victorious soldier
      repeated his blows: the huge idol was overthrown, and broken in
      pieces; and the limbs of Serapis were ignominiously dragged
      through the streets of Alexandria. His mangled carcass was burnt
      in the Amphitheatre, amidst the shouts of the populace; and many
      persons attributed their conversion to this discovery of the
      impotence of their tutelar deity. The popular modes of religion,
      that propose any visible and material objects of worship, have
      the advantage of adapting and familiarizing themselves to the
      senses of mankind: but this advantage is counterbalanced by the
      various and inevitable accidents to which the faith of the
      idolater is exposed. It is scarcely possible, that, in every
      disposition of mind, he should preserve his implicit reverence
      for the idols, or the relics, which the naked eye, and the
      profane hand, are unable to distinguish from the most common
      productions of art or nature; and if, in the hour of danger,
      their secret and miraculous virtue does not operate for their own
      preservation, he scorns the vain apologies of his priests, and
      justly derides the object, and the folly, of his superstitious
      attachment. 51 After the fall of Serapis, some hopes were still
      entertained by the Pagans, that the Nile would refuse his annual
      supply to the impious masters of Egypt; and the extraordinary
      delay of the inundation seemed to announce the displeasure of the
      river-god. But this delay was soon compensated by the rapid swell
      of the waters. They suddenly rose to such an unusual height, as
      to comfort the discontented party with the pleasing expectation
      of a deluge; till the peaceful river again subsided to the
      well-known and fertilizing level of sixteen cubits, or about
      thirty English feet. 52

      the laws of Theodosius, by which all sacrifices had been severely
      prohibited. The inhabitants of the country, whose conduct was
      less opposed to the eye of malicious curiosity, disguised their
      religious, under the appearance of convivial, meetings. On the
      days of solemn festivals, they assembled in great numbers under
      the spreading shade of some consecrated trees; sheep and oxen
      were slaughtered and roasted; and this rural entertainment was
      sanctified by the use of incense, and by the hymns which were
      sung in honor of the gods. But it was alleged, that, as no part
      of the animal was made a burnt-offering, as no altar was provided
      to receive the blood, and as the previous oblation of salt cakes,
      and the concluding ceremony of libations, were carefully omitted,
      these festal meetings did not involve the guests in the guilt, or
      penalty, of an illegal sacrifice. 53 Whatever might be the truth
      of the facts, or the merit of the distinction, 54 these vain
      pretences were swept away by the last edict of Theodosius, which
      inflicted a deadly wound on the superstition of the Pagans. 55
      5511 This prohibitory law is expressed in the most absolute and
      comprehensive terms. “It is our will and pleasure,” says the
      emperor, “that none of our subjects, whether magistrates or
      private citizens, however exalted or however humble may be their
      rank and condition, shall presume, in any city or in any place,
      to worship an inanimate idol, by the sacrifice of a guiltless
      victim.” The act of sacrificing, and the practice of divination
      by the entrails of the victim, are declared (without any regard
      to the object of the inquiry) a crime of high treason against the
      state, which can be expiated only by the death of the guilty. The
      rites of Pagan superstition, which might seem less bloody and
      atrocious, are abolished, as highly injurious to the truth and
      honor of religion; luminaries, garlands, frankincense, and
      libations of wine, are specially enumerated and condemned; and
      the harmless claims of the domestic genius, of the household
      gods, are included in this rigorous proscription. The use of any
      of these profane and illegal ceremonies, subjects the offender to
      the forfeiture of the house or estate, where they have been
      performed; and if he has artfully chosen the property of another
      for the scene of his impiety, he is compelled to discharge,
      without delay, a heavy fine of twenty-five pounds of gold, or
      more than one thousand pounds sterling. A fine, not less
      considerable, is imposed on the connivance of the secret enemies
      of religion, who shall neglect the duty of their respective
      stations, either to reveal, or to punish, the guilt of idolatry.
      Such was the persecuting spirit of the laws of Theodosius, which
      were repeatedly enforced by his sons and grandsons, with the loud
      and unanimous applause of the Christian world. 56

      inurbibus. In the middle of the same century, Maximus, bishop of
      Turin, writes against the heathen deities as if their worship was
      still in full vigor in the neighborhood of his city. Augustine
      complains of the encouragement of the Pagan rites by heathen
      landowners; and Zeno of Verona, still later, reproves the apathy
      of the Christian proprietors in conniving at this abuse. (Compare
      Neander, ii. p. 169.) M. Beugnot shows that this was the case
      throughout the north and centre of Italy and in Sicily. But
      neither of these authors has adverted to one fact, which must
      have tended greatly to retard the progress of Christianity in
      these quarters. It was still chiefly a slave population which
      cultivated the soil; and however, in the towns, the better class
      of Christians might be eager to communicate “the blessed liberty
      of the gospel” to this class of mankind; however their condition
      could not but be silently ameliorated by the humanizing influence
      of Christianity; yet, on the whole, no doubt the servile class
      would be the least fitted to receive the gospel; and its general
      propagation among them would be embarrassed by many peculiar
      difficulties. The rural population was probably not entirely

      Chapter XXVIII: Destruction Of Paganism.—Part III.

      In the cruel reigns of Decius and Diocletian, Christianity had
      been proscribed, as a revolt from the ancient and hereditary
      religion of the empire; and the unjust suspicions which were
      entertained of a dark and dangerous faction, were, in some
      measure, countenanced by the inseparable union and rapid
      conquests of the Catholic church. But the same excuses of fear
      and ignorance cannot be applied to the Christian emperors who
      violated the precepts of humanity and of the Gospel. The
      experience of ages had betrayed the weakness, as well as folly,
      of Paganism; the light of reason and of faith had already
      exposed, to the greatest part of mankind, the vanity of idols;
      and the declining sect, which still adhered to their worship,
      might have been permitted to enjoy, in peace and obscurity, the
      religious costumes of their ancestors. Had the Pagans been
      animated by the undaunted zeal which possessed the minds of the
      primitive believers, the triumph of the Church must have been
      stained with blood; and the martyrs of Jupiter and Apollo might
      have embraced the glorious opportunity of devoting their lives
      and fortunes at the foot of their altars. But such obstinate zeal
      was not congenial to the loose and careless temper of Polytheism.
      The violent and repeated strokes of the orthodox princes were
      broken by the soft and yielding substance against which they were
      directed; and the ready obedience of the Pagans protected them
      from the pains and penalties of the Theodosian Code. 57 Instead
      of asserting, that the authority of the gods was superior to that
      of the emperor, they desisted, with a plaintive murmur, from the
      use of those sacred rites which their sovereign had condemned. If
      they were sometimes tempted by a sally of passion, or by the
      hopes of concealment, to indulge their favorite superstition,
      their humble repentance disarmed the severity of the Christian
      magistrate, and they seldom refused to atone for their rashness,
      by submitting, with some secret reluctance, to the yoke of the
      Gospel. The churches were filled with the increasing multitude of
      these unworthy proselytes, who had conformed, from temporal
      motives, to the reigning religion; and whilst they devoutly
      imitated the postures, and recited the prayers, of the faithful,
      they satisfied their conscience by the silent and sincere
      invocation of the gods of antiquity. 58 If the Pagans wanted
      patience to suffer they wanted spirit to resist; and the
      scattered myriads, who deplored the ruin of the temples, yielded,
      without a contest, to the fortune of their adversaries. The
      disorderly opposition 59 of the peasants of Syria, and the
      populace of Alexandria, to the rage of private fanaticism, was
      silenced by the name and authority of the emperor. The Pagans of
      the West, without contributing to the elevation of Eugenius,
      disgraced, by their partial attachment, the cause and character
      of the usurper. The clergy vehemently exclaimed, that he
      aggravated the crime of rebellion by the guilt of apostasy; that,
      by his permission, the altar of victory was again restored; and
      that the idolatrous symbols of Jupiter and Hercules were
      displayed in the field, against the invincible standard of the
      cross. But the vain hopes of the Pagans were soon annihilated by
      the defeat of Eugenius; and they were left exposed to the
      resentment of the conqueror, who labored to deserve the favor of
      Heaven by the extirpation of idolatry. 60

      laws.]

      A nation of slaves is always prepared to applaud the clemency of
      their master, who, in the abuse of absolute power, does not
      proceed to the last extremes of injustice and oppression.
      Theodosius might undoubtedly have proposed to his Pagan subjects
      the alternative of baptism or of death; and the eloquent Libanius
      has praised the moderation of a prince, who never enacted, by any
      positive law, that all his subjects should immediately embrace
      and practise the religion of their sovereign. 61 The profession
      of Christianity was not made an essential qualification for the
      enjoyment of the civil rights of society, nor were any peculiar
      hardships imposed on the sectaries, who credulously received the
      fables of Ovid, and obstinately rejected the miracles of the
      Gospel. The palace, the schools, the army, and the senate, were
      filled with declared and devout Pagans; they obtained, without
      distinction, the civil and military honors of the empire. 6111
      Theodosius distinguished his liberal regard for virtue and genius
      by the consular dignity, which he bestowed on Symmachus; 62 and
      by the personal friendship which he expressed to Libanius; 63 and
      the two eloquent apologists of Paganism were never required
      either to change or to dissemble their religious opinions. The
      Pagans were indulged in the most licentious freedom of speech and
      writing; the historical and philosophic remains of Eunapius,
      Zosimus, 64 and the fanatic teachers of the school of Plato,
      betray the most furious animosity, and contain the sharpest
      invectives, against the sentiments and conduct of their
      victorious adversaries. If these audacious libels were publicly
      known, we must applaud the good sense of the Christian princes,
      who viewed, with a smile of contempt, the last struggles of
      superstition and despair. 65 But the Imperial laws, which
      prohibited the sacrifices and ceremonies of Paganism, were
      rigidly executed; and every hour contributed to destroy the
      influence of a religion, which was supported by custom, rather
      than by argument. The devotion or the poet, or the philosopher,
      may be secretly nourished by prayer, meditation, and study; but
      the exercise of public worship appears to be the only solid
      foundation of the religious sentiments of the people, which
      derive their force from imitation and habit. The interruption of
      that public exercise may consummate, in the period of a few
      years, the important work of a national revolution. The memory of
      theological opinions cannot long be preserved, without the
      artificial helps of priests, of temples, and of books. 66 The
      ignorant vulgar, whose minds are still agitated by the blind
      hopes and terrors of superstition, will be soon persuaded by
      their superiors to direct their vows to the reigning deities of
      the age; and will insensibly imbibe an ardent zeal for the
      support and propagation of the new doctrine, which spiritual
      hunger at first compelled them to accept. The generation that
      arose in the world after the promulgation of the Imperial laws,
      was attracted within the pale of the Catholic church: and so
      rapid, yet so gentle, was the fall of Paganism, that only
      twenty-eight years after the death of Theodosius, the faint and
      minute vestiges were no longer visible to the eye of the
      legislator. 67

      61 (return) [ Libanius suggests the form of a persecuting edict,
      which Theodosius might enact, (pro Templis, p. 32;) a rash joke,

      6111 (return) [ The most remarkable instance of this, at a much

      statue in honor of Merobaudes was placed in the Forum of Trajan,
      of which the inscription is still extant. Fragments of his poems
      have been recovered by the industry and sagacity of Niebuhr. In
      one passage, Merobaudes, in the genuine heathen spirit,
      attributes the ruin of the empire to the abolition of Paganism,
      and almost renews the old accusation of Atheism against
      Christianity. He impersonates some deity, probably Discord, who
      summons Bellona to take arms for the destruction of Rome; and in
      a strain of fierce irony recommends to her other fatal measures,
      to extirpate the gods of Rome:—

      The ruin of the Pagan religion is described by the sophists as a
      dreadful and amazing prodigy, which covered the earth with
      darkness, and restored the ancient dominion of chaos and of
      night. They relate, in solemn and pathetic strains, that the
      temples were converted into sepulchres, and that the holy places,
      which had been adorned by the statues of the gods, were basely
      polluted by the relics of Christian martyrs. “The monks” (a race
      of filthy animals, to whom Eunapius is tempted to refuse the name
      of men) “are the authors of the new worship, which, in the place
      of those deities who are conceived by the understanding, has
      substituted the meanest and most contemptible slaves. The heads,
      salted and pickled, of those infamous malefactors, who for the
      multitude of their crimes have suffered a just and ignominious
      death; their bodies still marked by the impression of the lash,
      and the scars of those tortures which were inflicted by the
      sentence of the magistrate; such” (continues Eunapius) “are the
      gods which the earth produces in our days; such are the martyrs,
      the supreme arbitrators of our prayers and petitions to the
      Deity, whose tombs are now consecrated as the objects of the
      veneration of the people.” 68 Without approving the malice, it is
      natural enough to share the surprise of the sophist, the
      spectator of a revolution, which raised those obscure victims of
      the laws of Rome to the rank of celestial and invisible
      protectors of the Roman empire. The grateful respect of the
      Christians for the martyrs of the faith, was exalted, by time and
      victory, into religious adoration; and the most illustrious of
      the saints and prophets were deservedly associated to the honors
      of the martyrs. One hundred and fifty years after the glorious
      deaths of St. Peter and St. Paul, the Vatican and the Ostian road
      were distinguished by the tombs, or rather by the trophies, of
      those spiritual heroes. 69 In the age which followed the
      conversion of Constantine, the emperors, the consuls, and the
      generals of armies, devoutly visited the sepulchres of a
      tentmaker and a fisherman; 70 and their venerable bones were
      deposited under the altars of Christ, on which the bishops of the
      royal city continually offered the unbloody sacrifice. 71 The new
      capital of the Eastern world, unable to produce any ancient and
      domestic trophies, was enriched by the spoils of dependent
      provinces. The bodies of St. Andrew, St. Luke, and St. Timothy,
      had reposed near three hundred years in the obscure graves, from
      whence they were transported, in solemn pomp, to the church of
      the apostles, which the magnificence of Constantine had founded
      on the banks of the Thracian Bosphorus. 72 About fifty years
      afterwards, the same banks were honored by the presence of
      Samuel, the judge and prophet of the people of Israel. His ashes,
      deposited in a golden vase, and covered with a silken veil, were
      delivered by the bishops into each other’s hands. The relics of
      Samuel were received by the people with the same joy and
      reverence which they would have shown to the living prophet; the
      highways, from Palestine to the gates of Constantinople, were
      filled with an uninterrupted procession; and the emperor Arcadius
      himself, at the head of the most illustrious members of the
      clergy and senate, advanced to meet his extraordinary guest, who
      had always deserved and claimed the homage of kings. 73 The
      example of Rome and Constantinople confirmed the faith and
      discipline of the Catholic world. The honors of the saints and
      martyrs, after a feeble and ineffectual murmur of profane reason,
      74 were universally established; and in the age of Ambrose and
      Jerom, something was still deemed wanting to the sanctity of a
      Christian church, till it had been consecrated by some portion of
      holy relics, which fixed and inflamed the devotion of the
      faithful.

      peruse the controversy of St. Jerom and Vigilantius, and St.
      Augustin’s account of the miracles of St. Stephen, may speedily
      gain some idea of the spirit of the Fathers.]

      In the long period of twelve hundred years, which elapsed between
      the reign of Constantine and the reformation of Luther, the
      worship of saints and relics corrupted the pure and perfect
      simplicity of the Christian model: and some symptoms of
      degeneracy may be observed even in the first generations which
      adopted and cherished this pernicious innovation.

      I. The satisfactory experience, that the relics of saints were
      more valuable than gold or precious stones, 75 stimulated the
      clergy to multiply the treasures of the church. Without much
      regard for truth or probability, they invented names for
      skeletons, and actions for names. The fame of the apostles, and
      of the holy men who had imitated their virtues, was darkened by
      religious fiction. To the invincible band of genuine and
      primitive martyrs, they added myriads of imaginary heroes, who
      had never existed, except in the fancy of crafty or credulous
      legendaries; and there is reason to suspect, that Tours might not
      be the only diocese in which the bones of a malefactor were
      adored, instead of those of a saint. 76 A superstitious practice,
      which tended to increase the temptations of fraud, and credulity,
      insensibly extinguished the light of history, and of reason, in
      the Christian world.

      648) has applied a worldly sense to the pious observation of the
      clergy of Smyrna, who carefully preserved the relics of St.
      Polycarp the martyr.]

      76 (return) [ Martin of Tours (see his Life, c. 8, by Sulpicius
      Severus) extorted this confession from the mouth of the dead man.
      The error is allowed to be natural; the discovery is supposed to
      be miraculous. Which of the two was likely to happen most
      frequently?]

      II. But the progress of superstition would have been much less
      rapid and victorious, if the faith of the people had not been
      assisted by the seasonable aid of visions and miracles, to
      ascertain the authenticity and virtue of the most suspicious
      relics. In the reign of the younger Theodosius, Lucian, 77 a
      presbyter of Jerusalem, and the ecclesiastical minister of the
      village of Caphargamala, about twenty miles from the city,
      related a very singular dream, which, to remove his doubts, had
      been repeated on three successive Saturdays. A venerable figure
      stood before him, in the silence of the night, with a long beard,
      a white robe, and a gold rod; announced himself by the name of
      Gamaliel, and revealed to the astonished presbyter, that his own
      corpse, with the bodies of his son Abibas, his friend Nicodemus,
      and the illustrious Stephen, the first martyr of the Christian
      faith, were secretly buried in the adjacent field. He added, with
      some impatience, that it was time to release himself and his
      companions from their obscure prison; that their appearance would
      be salutary to a distressed world; and that they had made choice
      of Lucian to inform the bishop of Jerusalem of their situation
      and their wishes. The doubts and difficulties which still
      retarded this important discovery were successively removed by
      new visions; and the ground was opened by the bishop, in the
      presence of an innumerable multitude. The coffins of Gamaliel, of
      his son, and of his friend, were found in regular order; but when
      the fourth coffin, which contained the remains of Stephen, was
      shown to the light, the earth trembled, and an odor, such as that
      of paradise, was smelt, which instantly cured the various
      diseases of seventy-three of the assistants. The companions of
      Stephen were left in their peaceful residence of Caphargamala:
      but the relics of the first martyr were transported, in solemn
      procession, to a church constructed in their honor on Mount Sion;
      and the minute particles of those relics, a drop of blood, 78 or
      the scrapings of a bone, were acknowledged, in almost every
      province of the Roman world, to possess a divine and miraculous
      virtue. The grave and learned Augustin, 79 whose understanding
      scarcely admits the excuse of credulity, has attested the
      innumerable prodigies which were performed in Africa by the
      relics of St. Stephen; and this marvellous narrative is inserted
      in the elaborate work of the City of God, which the bishop of
      Hippo designed as a solid and immortal proof of the truth of
      Christianity. Augustin solemnly declares, that he has selected
      those miracles only which were publicly certified by the persons
      who were either the objects, or the spectators, of the power of
      the martyr. Many prodigies were omitted, or forgotten; and Hippo
      had been less favorably treated than the other cities of the
      province. And yet the bishop enumerates above seventy miracles,
      of which three were resurrections from the dead, in the space of
      two years, and within the limits of his own diocese. 80 If we
      enlarge our view to all the dioceses, and all the saints, of the
      Christian world, it will not be easy to calculate the fables, and
      the errors, which issued from this inexhaustible source. But we
      may surely be allowed to observe, that a miracle, in that age of
      superstition and credulity, lost its name and its merit, since it
      could scarcely be considered as a deviation from the ordinary and
      established laws of nature.

      St. Augustin have given (at the end of the work de Civitate Dei)

      vigorously, and not unskilfully, executed.]

      Juifs, tom. vii. p. 249) has preserved a Gallic or a Spanish
      proverb, “Whoever pretends to have read all the miracles of St.
      Stephen, he lies.”]

      III. The innumerable miracles, of which the tombs of the martyrs
      were the perpetual theatre, revealed to the pious believer the
      actual state and constitution of the invisible world; and his
      religious speculations appeared to be founded on the firm basis
      of fact and experience. Whatever might be the condition of vulgar
      souls, in the long interval between the dissolution and the
      resurrection of their bodies, it was evident that the superior
      spirits of the saints and martyrs did not consume that portion of
      their existence in silent and inglorious sleep. 81 It was evident
      (without presuming to determine the place of their habitation, or
      the nature of their felicity) that they enjoyed the lively and
      active consciousness of their happiness, their virtue, and their
      powers; and that they had already secured the possession of their
      eternal reward. The enlargement of their intellectual faculties
      surpassed the measure of the human imagination; since it was
      proved by experience, that they were capable of hearing and
      understanding the various petitions of their numerous votaries;
      who, in the same moment of time, but in the most distant parts of
      the world, invoked the name and assistance of Stephen or of
      Martin. 82 The confidence of their petitioners was founded on the
      persuasion, that the saints, who reigned with Christ, cast an eye
      of pity upon earth; that they were warmly interested in the
      prosperity of the Catholic Church; and that the individuals, who
      imitated the example of their faith and piety, were the peculiar
      and favorite objects of their most tender regard. Sometimes,
      indeed, their friendship might be influenced by considerations of
      a less exalted kind: they viewed with partial affection the
      places which had been consecrated by their birth, their
      residence, their death, their burial, or the possession of their
      relics. The meaner passions of pride, avarice, and revenge, may
      be deemed unworthy of a celestial breast; yet the saints
      themselves condescended to testify their grateful approbation of
      the liberality of their votaries; and the sharpest bolts of
      punishment were hurled against those impious wretches, who
      violated their magnificent shrines, or disbelieved their
      supernatural power. 83 Atrocious, indeed, must have been the
      guilt, and strange would have been the scepticism, of those men,
      if they had obstinately resisted the proofs of a divine agency,
      which the elements, the whole range of the animal creation, and
      even the subtle and invisible operations of the human mind, were
      compelled to obey. 84 The immediate, and almost instantaneous,
      effects that were supposed to follow the prayer, or the offence,
      satisfied the Christians of the ample measure of favor and
      authority which the saints enjoyed in the presence of the Supreme
      God; and it seemed almost superfluous to inquire whether they
      were continually obliged to intercede before the throne of grace;
      or whether they might not be permitted to exercise, according to
      the dictates of their benevolence and justice, the delegated
      powers of their subordinate ministry. The imagination, which had
      been raised by a painful effort to the contemplation and worship
      of the Universal Cause, eagerly embraced such inferior objects of
      adoration as were more proportioned to its gross conceptions and
      imperfect faculties. The sublime and simple theology of the
      primitive Christians was gradually corrupted; and the Monarchy of
      heaven, already clouded by metaphysical subtleties, was degraded
      by the introduction of a popular mythology, which tended to
      restore the reign of polytheism. 85

      IV. As the objects of religion were gradually reduced to the
      standard of the imagination, the rites and ceremonies were
      introduced that seemed most powerfully to affect the senses of
      the vulgar. If, in the beginning of the fifth century, 86
      Tertullian, or Lactantius, 87 had been suddenly raised from the
      dead, to assist at the festival of some popular saint, or martyr,
      88 they would have gazed with astonishment, and indignation, on
      the profane spectacle, which had succeeded to the pure and
      spiritual worship of a Christian congregation. As soon as the
      doors of the church were thrown open, they must have been
      offended by the smoke of incense, the perfume of flowers, and the
      glare of lamps and tapers, which diffused, at noonday, a gaudy,
      superfluous, and, in their opinion, a sacrilegious light. If they
      approached the balustrade of the altar, they made their way
      through the prostrate crowd, consisting, for the most part, of
      strangers and pilgrims, who resorted to the city on the vigil of
      the feast; and who already felt the strong intoxication of
      fanaticism, and, perhaps, of wine. Their devout kisses were
      imprinted on the walls and pavement of the sacred edifice; and
      their fervent prayers were directed, whatever might be the
      language of their church, to the bones, the blood, or the ashes
      of the saint, which were usually concealed, by a linen or silken
      veil, from the eyes of the vulgar. The Christians frequented the
      tombs of the martyrs, in the hope of obtaining, from their
      powerful intercession, every sort of spiritual, but more
      especially of temporal, blessings. They implored the preservation
      of their health, or the cure of their infirmities; the
      fruitfulness of their barren wives, or the safety and happiness
      of their children. Whenever they undertook any distant or
      dangerous journey, they requested, that the holy martyrs would be
      their guides and protectors on the road; and if they returned
      without having experienced any misfortune, they again hastened to
      the tombs of the martyrs, to celebrate, with grateful
      thanksgivings, their obligations to the memory and relics of
      those heavenly patrons. The walls were hung round with symbols of
      the favors which they had received; eyes, and hands, and feet, of
      gold and silver: and edifying pictures, which could not long
      escape the abuse of indiscreet or idolatrous devotion,
      represented the image, the attributes, and the miracles of the
      tutelar saint. The same uniform original spirit of superstition
      might suggest, in the most distant ages and countries, the same
      methods of deceiving the credulity, and of affecting the senses
      of mankind: 89 but it must ingenuously be confessed, that the
      ministers of the Catholic church imitated the profane model,
      which they were impatient to destroy. The most respectable
      bishops had persuaded themselves that the ignorant rustics would
      more cheerfully renounce the superstitions of Paganism, if they
      found some resemblance, some compensation, in the bosom of
      Christianity. The religion of Constantine achieved, in less than
      a century, the final conquest of the Roman empire: but the
      victors themselves were insensibly subdued by the arts of their
      vanquished rivals. 90 9011
