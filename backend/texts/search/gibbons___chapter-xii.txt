Chapter XII: Reigns Of Tacitus, Probus, Carus And His Sons.—Part
      I.

     Conduct Of The Army And Senate After The Death Of Aurelian.
     —Reigns Of Tacitus, Probus, Carus, And His Sons.

      Such was the unhappy condition of the Roman emperors, that,
      whatever might be their conduct, their fate was commonly the
      same. A life of pleasure or virtue, of severity or mildness, of
      indolence or glory, alike led to an untimely grave; and almost
      every reign is closed by the same disgusting repetition of
      treason and murder. The death of Aurelian, however, is remarkable
      by its extraordinary consequences. The legions admired, lamented,
      and revenged their victorious chief. The artifice of his
      perfidious secretary was discovered and punished.

      The deluded conspirators attended the funeral of their injured
      sovereign, with sincere or well-feigned contrition, and submitted
      to the unanimous resolution of the military order, which was
      signified by the following epistle: “The brave and fortunate
      armies to the senate and people of Rome.—The crime of one man,
      and the error of many, have deprived us of the late emperor
      Aurelian. May it please you, venerable lords and fathers! to
      place him in the number of the gods, and to appoint a successor
      whom your judgment shall declare worthy of the Imperial purple!
      None of those whose guilt or misfortune have contributed to our
      loss, shall ever reign over us.” 1 The Roman senators heard,
      without surprise, that another emperor had been assassinated in
      his camp; they secretly rejoiced in the fall of Aurelian; but the
      modest and dutiful address of the legions, when it was
      communicated in full assembly by the consul, diffused the most
      pleasing astonishment. Such honors as fear and perhaps esteem
      could extort, they liberally poured forth on the memory of their
      deceased sovereign. Such acknowledgments as gratitude could
      inspire, they returned to the faithful armies of the republic,
      who entertained so just a sense of the legal authority of the
      senate in the choice of an emperor. Yet, notwithstanding this
      flattering appeal, the most prudent of the assembly declined
      exposing their safety and dignity to the caprice of an armed
      multitude. The strength of the legions was, indeed, a pledge of
      their sincerity, since those who may command are seldom reduced
      to the necessity of dissembling; but could it naturally be
      expected, that a hasty repentance would correct the inveterate
      habits of fourscore years? Should the soldiers relapse into their
      accustomed seditions, their insolence might disgrace the majesty
      of the senate, and prove fatal to the object of its choice.
      Motives like these dictated a decree, by which the election of a
      new emperor was referred to the suffrage of the military order.

      1 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 222. Aurelius Victor
      mentions a formal deputation from the troops to the senate.]

      The contention that ensued is one of the best attested, but most
      improbable events in the history of mankind. 2 The troops, as if
      satiated with the exercise of power, again conjured the senate to
      invest one of its own body with the Imperial purple. The senate
      still persisted in its refusal; the army in its request. The
      reciprocal offer was pressed and rejected at least three times,
      and, whilst the obstinate modesty of either party was resolved to
      receive a master from the hands of the other, eight months
      insensibly elapsed; an amazing period of tranquil anarchy, during
      which the Roman world remained without a sovereign, without a
      usurper, and without a sedition. 201 The generals and magistrates
      appointed by Aurelian continued to execute their ordinary
      functions; and it is observed, that a proconsul of Asia was the
      only considerable person removed from his office in the whole
      course of the interregnum.

      2 (return) [ Vopiscus, our principal authority, wrote at Rome,
      sixteen years only after the death of Aurelian; and, besides the
      recent notoriety of the facts, constantly draws his materials
      from the Journals of the Senate, and the original papers of the
      Ulpian library. Zosimus and Zonaras appear as ignorant of this
      transaction as they were in general of the Roman constitution.]

      201 (return) [ The interregnum could not be more than seven
      months; Aurelian was assassinated in the middle of March, the
      year of Rome 1028. Tacitus was elected the 25th September in the
      same year.—G.]

      An event somewhat similar, but much less authentic, is supposed
      to have happened after the death of Romulus, who, in his life and
      character, bore some affinity with Aurelian. The throne was
      vacant during twelve months, till the election of a Sabine
      philosopher, and the public peace was guarded in the same manner,
      by the union of the several orders of the state. But, in the time
      of Numa and Romulus, the arms of the people were controlled by
      the authority of the Patricians; and the balance of freedom was
      easily preserved in a small and virtuous community. 3 The decline
      of the Roman state, far different from its infancy, was attended
      with every circumstance that could banish from an interregnum the
      prospect of obedience and harmony: an immense and tumultuous
      capital, a wide extent of empire, the servile equality of
      despotism, an army of four hundred thousand mercenaries, and the
      experience of frequent revolutions. Yet, notwithstanding all
      these temptations, the discipline and memory of Aurelian still
      restrained the seditious temper of the troops, as well as the
      fatal ambition of their leaders. The flower of the legions
      maintained their stations on the banks of the Bosphorus, and the
      Imperial standard awed the less powerful camps of Rome and of the
      provinces. A generous though transient enthusiasm seemed to
      animate the military order; and we may hope that a few real
      patriots cultivated the returning friendship of the army and the
      senate as the only expedient capable of restoring the republic to
      its ancient beauty and vigor.

      in Numa, p. 60. The first of these writers relates the story like
      an orator, the second like a lawyer, and the third like a
      moralist, and none of them probably without some intermixture of
      fable.]

      On the twenty-fifth of September, near eight months after the
      murder of Aurelian, the consul convoked an assembly of the
      senate, and reported the doubtful and dangerous situation of the
      empire. He slightly insinuated, that the precarious loyalty of
      the soldiers depended on the chance of every hour, and of every
      accident; but he represented, with the most convincing eloquence,
      the various dangers that might attend any further delay in the
      choice of an emperor. Intelligence, he said, was already
      received, that the Germans had passed the Rhine, and occupied
      some of the strongest and most opulent cities of Gaul. The
      ambition of the Persian king kept the East in perpetual alarms;
      Egypt, Africa, and Illyricum, were exposed to foreign and
      domestic arms, and the levity of Syria would prefer even a female
      sceptre to the sanctity of the Roman laws. The consul, then
      addressing himself to Tacitus, the first of the senators, 4
      required his opinion on the important subject of a proper
      candidate for the vacant throne.

      4 (return) [ Vopiscus (in Hist. August p. 227) calls him “primæ
      sententia consularis;” and soon afterwards Princeps senatus. It
      is natural to suppose, that the monarchs of Rome, disdaining that
      humble title, resigned it to the most ancient of the senators.]

      If we can prefer personal merit to accidental greatness, we shall
      esteem the birth of Tacitus more truly noble than that of kings.
      He claimed his descent from the philosophic historian whose
      writings will instruct the last generations of mankind. 5 The
      senator Tacitus was then seventy-five years of age. 6 The long
      period of his innocent life was adorned with wealth and honors.
      He had twice been invested with the consular dignity, 7 and
      enjoyed with elegance and sobriety his ample patrimony of between
      two and three millions sterling. 8 The experience of so many
      princes, whom he had esteemed or endured, from the vain follies
      of Elagabalus to the useful rigor of Aurelian, taught him to form
      a just estimate of the duties, the dangers, and the temptations
      of their sublime station. From the assiduous study of his
      immortal ancestor, he derived the knowledge of the Roman
      constitution, and of human nature. 9 The voice of the people had
      already named Tacitus as the citizen the most worthy of empire.
      The ungrateful rumor reached his ears, and induced him to seek
      the retirement of one of his villas in Campania. He had passed
      two months in the delightful privacy of Baiæ, when he reluctantly
      obeyed the summons of the consul to resume his honorable place in
      the senate, and to assist the republic with his counsels on this
      important occasion.

      5 (return) [ The only objection to this genealogy is, that the
      historian was named Cornelius, the emperor, Claudius. But under
      the lower empire, surnames were extremely various and uncertain.]

      6 (return) [ Zonaras, l. xii. p. 637. The Alexandrian Chronicle,
      by an obvious mistake, transfers that age to Aurelian.]

      7 (return) [ In the year 273, he was ordinary consul. But he must
      have been Suffectus many years before, and most probably under
      Valerian.]

      8 (return) [ Bis millies octingenties. Vopiscus in Hist. August
      p. 229. This sum, according to the old standard, was equivalent
      to eight hundred and forty thousand Roman pounds of silver, each
      of the value of three pounds sterling. But in the age of Tacitus,
      the coin had lost much of its weight and purity.]

      9 (return) [ After his accession, he gave orders that ten copies
      of the historian should be annually transcribed and placed in the
      public libraries. The Roman libraries have long since perished,
      and the most valuable part of Tacitus was preserved in a single
      Ms., and discovered in a monastery of Westphalia. See Bayle,
      Dictionnaire, Art. Tacite, and Lipsius ad Annal. ii. 9.]

      He arose to speak, when from every quarter of the house, he was
      saluted with the names of Augustus and emperor. “Tacitus
      Augustus, the gods preserve thee! we choose thee for our
      sovereign; to thy care we intrust the republic and the world.
      Accept the empire from the authority of the senate. It is due to
      thy rank, to thy conduct, to thy manners.” As soon as the tumult
      of acclamations subsided, Tacitus attempted to decline the
      dangerous honor, and to express his wonder, that they should
      elect his age and infirmities to succeed the martial vigor of
      Aurelian. “Are these limbs, conscript fathers! fitted to sustain
      the weight of armor, or to practise the exercises of the camp?
      The variety of climates, and the hardships of a military life,
      would soon oppress a feeble constitution, which subsists only by
      the most tender management. My exhausted strength scarcely
      enables me to discharge the duty of a senator; how insufficient
      would it prove to the arduous labors of war and government! Can
      you hope, that the legions will respect a weak old man, whose
      days have been spent in the shade of peace and retirement? Can
      you desire that I should ever find reason to regret the favorable
      opinion of the senate?” 10

      10 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 227.]

      The reluctance of Tacitus (and it might possibly be sincere) was
      encountered by the affectionate obstinacy of the senate. Five
      hundred voices repeated at once, in eloquent confusion, that the
      greatest of the Roman princes, Numa, Trajan, Hadrian, and the
      Antonines, had ascended the throne in a very advanced season of
      life; that the mind, not the body, a sovereign, not a soldier,
      was the object of their choice; and that they expected from him
      no more than to guide by his wisdom the valor of the legions.
      These pressing though tumultuary instances were seconded by a
      more regular oration of Metius Falconius, the next on the
      consular bench to Tacitus himself. He reminded the assembly of
      the evils which Rome had endured from the vices of headstrong and
      capricious youths, congratulated them on the election of a
      virtuous and experienced senator, and, with a manly, though
      perhaps a selfish, freedom, exhorted Tacitus to remember the
      reasons of his elevation, and to seek a successor, not in his own
      family, but in the republic. The speech of Falconius was enforced
      by a general acclamation. The emperor elect submitted to the
      authority of his country, and received the voluntary homage of
      his equals. The judgment of the senate was confirmed by the
      consent of the Roman people and of the Prætorian guards. 11

      11 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 228. Tacitus addressed the
      Prætorians by the appellation of sanctissimi milites, and the
      people by that of sacratissim. Quirites.]

      The administration of Tacitus was not unworthy of his life and
      principles. A grateful servant of the senate, he considered that
      national council as the author, and himself as the subject, of
      the laws. 12 He studied to heal the wounds which Imperial pride,
      civil discord, and military violence, had inflicted on the
      constitution, and to restore, at least, the image of the ancient
      republic, as it had been preserved by the policy of Augustus, and
      the virtues of Trajan and the Antonines. It may not be useless to
      recapitulate some of the most important prerogatives which the
      senate appeared to have regained by the election of Tacitus. 13
      1. To invest one of their body, under the title of emperor, with
      the general command of the armies, and the government of the
      frontier provinces. 2. To determine the list, or, as it was then
      styled, the College of Consuls. They were twelve in number, who,
      in successive pairs, each, during the space of two months, filled
      the year, and represented the dignity of that ancient office. The
      authority of the senate, in the nomination of the consuls, was
      exercised with such independent freedom, that no regard was paid
      to an irregular request of the emperor in favor of his brother
      Florianus. “The senate,” exclaimed Tacitus, with the honest
      transport of a patriot, “understand the character of a prince
      whom they have chosen.” 3. To appoint the proconsuls and
      presidents of the provinces, and to confer on all the magistrates
      their civil jurisdiction. 4. To receive appeals through the
      intermediate office of the præfect of the city from all the
      tribunals of the empire. 5. To give force and validity, by their
      decrees, to such as they should approve of the emperor’s edicts.
      6. To these several branches of authority we may add some
      inspection over the finances, since, even in the stern reign of
      Aurelian, it was in their power to divert a part of the revenue
      from the public service. 14

      12 (return) [ In his manumissions he never exceeded the number of
      a hundred, as limited by the Caninian law, which was enacted
      under Augustus, and at length repealed by Justinian. See Casaubon
      ad locum Vopisci.]

      13 (return) [ See the lives of Tacitus, Florianus, and Probus, in
      the Augustan History; we may be well assured, that whatever the
      soldier gave the senator had already given.]

      14 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 216. The passage is
      perfectly clear, both Casaubon and Salmasius wish to correct it.]

      Circular epistles were sent, without delay, to all the principal
      cities of the empire, Treves, Milan, Aquileia, Thessalonica,
      Corinth, Athens, Antioch, Alexandria, and Carthage, to claim
      their obedience, and to inform them of the happy revolution,
      which had restored the Roman senate to its ancient dignity. Two
      of these epistles are still extant. We likewise possess two very
      singular fragments of the private correspondence of the senators
      on this occasion. They discover the most excessive joy, and the
      most unbounded hopes. “Cast away your indolence,” it is thus that
      one of the senators addresses his friend, “emerge from your
      retirements of Baiæ and Puteoli. Give yourself to the city, to
      the senate. Rome flourishes, the whole republic flourishes.
      Thanks to the Roman army, to an army truly Roman; at length we
      have recovered our just authority, the end of all our desires. We
      hear appeals, we appoint proconsuls, we create emperors; perhaps
      too we may restrain them—to the wise a word is sufficient.” 15
      These lofty expectations were, however, soon disappointed; nor,
      indeed, was it possible that the armies and the provinces should
      long obey the luxurious and unwarlike nobles of Rome. On the
      slightest touch, the unsupported fabric of their pride and power
      fell to the ground. The expiring senate displayed a sudden
      lustre, blazed for a moment, and was extinguished forever.

      15 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 230, 232, 233. The
      senators celebrated the happy restoration with hecatombs and
      public rejoicings.]

      All that had yet passed at Rome was no more than a theatrical
      representation, unless it was ratified by the more substantial
      power of the legions. Leaving the senators to enjoy their dream
      of freedom and ambition, Tacitus proceeded to the Thracian camp,
      and was there, by the Prætorian præfect, presented to the
      assembled troops, as the prince whom they themselves had
      demanded, and whom the senate had bestowed. As soon as the
      præfect was silent, the emperor addressed himself to the soldiers
      with eloquence and propriety. He gratified their avarice by a
      liberal distribution of treasure, under the names of pay and
      donative. He engaged their esteem by a spirited declaration, that
      although his age might disable him from the performance of
      military exploits, his counsels should never be unworthy of a
      Roman general, the successor of the brave Aurelian. 16

      16 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 228.]

      Whilst the deceased emperor was making preparations for a second
      expedition into the East, he had negotiated with the Alani, 161 a
      Scythian people, who pitched their tents in the neighborhood of
      the Lake Mæotis. Those barbarians, allured by presents and
      subsidies, had promised to invade Persia with a numerous body of
      light cavalry. They were faithful to their engagements; but when
      they arrived on the Roman frontier, Aurelian was already dead,
      the design of the Persian war was at least suspended, and the
      generals, who, during the interregnum, exercised a doubtful
      authority, were unprepared either to receive or to oppose them.
      Provoked by such treatment, which they considered as trifling and
      perfidious, the Alani had recourse to their own valor for their
      payment and revenge; and as they moved with the usual swiftness
      of Tartars, they had soon spread themselves over the provinces of
      Pontus, Cappadocia, Cilicia, and Galatia. The legions, who from
      the opposite shores of the Bosphorus could almost distinguish the
      flames of the cities and villages, impatiently urged their
      general to lead them against the invaders. The conduct of Tacitus
      was suitable to his age and station. He convinced the barbarians
      of the faith, as well as the power, of the empire. Great numbers
      of the Alani, appeased by the punctual discharge of the
      engagements which Aurelian had contracted with them, relinquished
      their booty and captives, and quietly retreated to their own
      deserts, beyond the Phasis. Against the remainder, who refused
      peace, the Roman emperor waged, in person, a successful war.
      Seconded by an army of brave and experienced veterans, in a few
      weeks he delivered the provinces of Asia from the terror of the
      Scythian invasion. 17

      161 (return) [ On the Alani, see ch. xxvi. note 55.—M.]

      17 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 230. Zosimus, l. i. p.
      57. Zonaras, l. xii. p. 637. Two passages in the life of Probus
      (p. 236, 238) convince me, that these Scythian invaders of Pontus
      were Alani. If we may believe Zosimus, (l. i. p. 58,) Florianus
      pursued them as far as the Cimmerian Bosphorus. But he had
      scarcely time for so long and difficult an expedition.]

      But the glory and life of Tacitus were of short duration.
      Transported, in the depth of winter, from the soft retirement of
      Campania to the foot of Mount Caucasus, he sunk under the
      unaccustomed hardships of a military life. The fatigues of the
      body were aggravated by the cares of the mind. For a while, the
      angry and selfish passions of the soldiers had been suspended by
      the enthusiasm of public virtue. They soon broke out with
      redoubled violence, and raged in the camp, and even in the tent
      of the aged emperor. His mild and amiable character served only
      to inspire contempt, and he was incessantly tormented with
      factions which he could not assuage, and by demands which it was
      impossible to satisfy. Whatever flattering expectations he had
      conceived of reconciling the public disorders, Tacitus soon was
      convinced that the licentiousness of the army disdained the
      feeble restraint of laws, and his last hour was hastened by
      anguish and disappointment. It may be doubtful whether the
      soldiers imbrued their hands in the blood of this innocent
      prince. 18 It is certain that their insolence was the cause of
      his death. He expired at Tyana in Cappadocia, after a reign of
      only six months and about twenty days. 19

      18 (return) [ Eutropius and Aurelius Victor only say that he
      died; Victor Junior adds, that it was of a fever. Zosimus and
      Zonaras affirm, that he was killed by the soldiers. Vopiscus
      mentions both accounts, and seems to hesitate. Yet surely these
      jarring opinions are easily reconciled.]

      19 (return) [ According to the two Victors, he reigned exactly
      two hundred days.]

      The eyes of Tacitus were scarcely closed, before his brother
      Florianus showed himself unworthy to reign, by the hasty
      usurpation of the purple, without expecting the approbation of
      the senate. The reverence for the Roman constitution, which yet
      influenced the camp and the provinces, was sufficiently strong to
      dispose them to censure, but not to provoke them to oppose, the
      precipitate ambition of Florianus. The discontent would have
      evaporated in idle murmurs, had not the general of the East, the
      heroic Probus, boldly declared himself the avenger of the senate.

      The contest, however, was still unequal; nor could the most able
      leader, at the head of the effeminate troops of Egypt and Syria,
      encounter, with any hopes of victory, the legions of Europe,
      whose irresistible strength appeared to support the brother of
      Tacitus. But the fortune and activity of Probus triumphed over
      every obstacle. The hardy veterans of his rival, accustomed to
      cold climates, sickened and consumed away in the sultry heats of
      Cilicia, where the summer proved remarkably unwholesome. Their
      numbers were diminished by frequent desertion; the passes of the
      mountains were feebly defended; Tarsus opened its gates; and the
      soldiers of Florianus, when they had permitted him to enjoy the
      Imperial title about three months, delivered the empire from
      civil war by the easy sacrifice of a prince whom they despised.

      Zonaras, l. xii. p. 637. Aurelius Victor says, that Probus
      assumed the empire in Illyricum; an opinion which (though adopted
      by a very learned man) would throw that period of history into
      inextricable confusion.]

      The perpetual revolutions of the throne had so perfectly erased
      every notion of hereditary title, that the family of an
      unfortunate emperor was incapable of exciting the jealousy of his
      successors. The children of Tacitus and Florianus were permitted
      to descend into a private station, and to mingle with the general
      mass of the people. Their poverty indeed became an additional
      safeguard to their innocence. When Tacitus was elected by the
      senate, he resigned his ample patrimony to the public service; 21
      an act of generosity specious in appearance, but which evidently
      disclosed his intention of transmitting the empire to his
      descendants. The only consolation of their fallen state was the
      remembrance of transient greatness, and a distant hope, the child
      of a flattering prophecy, that at the end of a thousand years, a
      monarch of the race of Tacitus should arise, the protector of the
      senate, the restorer of Rome, and the conqueror of the whole
      earth. 22

      22 (return) [ He was to send judges to the Parthians, Persians,
      and Sarmatians, a president to Taprobani, and a proconsul to the
      Roman island, (supposed by Casaubon and Salmasius to mean
      Britain.) Such a history as mine (says Vopiscus with proper
      modesty) will not subsist a thousand years, to expose or justify
      the prediction.]

      The peasants of Illyricum, who had already given Claudius and
      Aurelian to the sinking empire, had an equal right to glory in
      the elevation of Probus. 23 Above twenty years before, the
      emperor Valerian, with his usual penetration, had discovered the
      rising merit of the young soldier, on whom he conferred the rank
      of tribune, long before the age prescribed by the military
      regulations. The tribune soon justified his choice, by a victory
      over a great body of Sarmatians, in which he saved the life of a
      near relation of Valerian; and deserved to receive from the
      emperor’s hand the collars, bracelets, spears, and banners, the
      mural and the civic crown, and all the honorable rewards reserved
      by ancient Rome for successful valor. The third, and afterwards
      the tenth, legion were intrusted to the command of Probus, who,
      in every step of his promotion, showed himself superior to the
      station which he filled. Africa and Pontus, the Rhine, the
      Danube, the Euphrates, and the Nile, by turns afforded him the
      most splendid occasions of displaying his personal prowess and
      his conduct in war. Aurelian was indebted for the honest courage
      with which he often checked the cruelty of his master. Tacitus,
      who desired by the abilities of his generals to supply his own
      deficiency of military talents, named him commander-in-chief of
      all the eastern provinces, with five times the usual salary, the
      promise of the consulship, and the hope of a triumph. When Probus
      ascended the Imperial throne, he was about forty-four years of
      age; 24 in the full possession of his fame, of the love of the
      army, and of a mature vigor of mind and body.

      His acknowledged merit, and the success of his arms against
      Florianus, left him without an enemy or a competitor. Yet, if we
      may credit his own professions, very far from being desirous of
      the empire, he had accepted it with the most sincere reluctance.
      “But it is no longer in my power,” says Probus, in a private
      letter, “to lay down a title so full of envy and of danger. I
      must continue to personate the character which the soldiers have
      imposed upon me.” 25 His dutiful address to the senate displayed
      the sentiments, or at least the language, of a Roman patriot:
      “When you elected one of your order, conscript fathers! to
      succeed the emperor Aurelian, you acted in a manner suitable to
      your justice and wisdom. For you are the legal sovereigns of the
      world, and the power which you derive from your ancestors will
      descend to your posterity. Happy would it have been, if
      Florianus, instead of usurping the purple of his brother, like a
      private inheritance, had expected what your majesty might
      determine, either in his favor, or in that of any other person.
      The prudent soldiers have punished his rashness. To me they have
      offered the title of Augustus. But I submit to your clemency my
      pretensions and my merits.” 26 When this respectful epistle was
      read by the consul, the senators were unable to disguise their
      satisfaction, that Probus should condescend thus numbly to
      solicit a sceptre which he already possessed. They celebrated
      with the warmest gratitude his virtues, his exploits, and above
      all his moderation. A decree immediately passed, without a
      dissenting voice, to ratify the election of the eastern armies,
      and to confer on their chief all the several branches of the
      Imperial dignity: the names of Cæsar and Augustus, the title of
      Father of his country, the right of making in the same day three
      motions in the senate, 27 the office of Pontifex Maximus, the
      tribunitian power, and the proconsular command; a mode of
      investiture, which, though it seemed to multiply the authority of
      the emperor, expressed the constitution of the ancient republic.
      The reign of Probus corresponded with this fair beginning. The
      senate was permitted to direct the civil administration of the
      empire. Their faithful general asserted the honor of the Roman
      arms, and often laid at their feet crowns of gold and barbaric
      trophies, the fruits of his numerous victories. 28 Yet, whilst he
      gratified their vanity, he must secretly have despised their
      indolence and weakness. Though it was every moment in their power
      to repeal the disgraceful edict of Gallienus, the proud
      successors of the Scipios patiently acquiesced in their exclusion
      from all military employments. They soon experienced, that those
      who refuse the sword must renounce the sceptre.

      Chapter XII: Reigns Of Tacitus, Probus, Carus And His Sons.—Part
      II.

      The strength of Aurelian had crushed on every side the enemies of
      Rome. After his death they seemed to revive with an increase of
      fury and of numbers. They were again vanquished by the active
      vigor of Probus, who, in a short reign of about six years, 29
      equalled the fame of ancient heroes, and restored peace and order
      to every province of the Roman world. The dangerous frontier of
      Rhætia he so firmly secured, that he left it without the
      suspicion of an enemy. He broke the wandering power of the
      Sarmatian tribes, and by the terror of his arms compelled those
      barbarians to relinquish their spoil. The Gothic nation courted
      the alliance of so warlike an emperor. 30 He attacked the
      Isaurians in their mountains, besieged and took several of their
      strongest castles, 31 and flattered himself that he had forever
      suppressed a domestic foe, whose independence so deeply wounded
      the majesty of the empire. The troubles excited by the usurper
      Firmus in the Upper Egypt had never been perfectly appeased, and
      the cities of Ptolemais and Coptos, fortified by the alliance of
      the Blemmyes, still maintained an obscure rebellion. The
      chastisement of those cities, and of their auxiliaries the
      savages of the South, is said to have alarmed the court of
      Persia, 32 and the Great King sued in vain for the friendship of
      Probus. Most of the exploits which distinguished his reign were
      achieved by the personal valor and conduct of the emperor,
      insomuch that the writer of his life expresses some amazement
      how, in so short a time, a single man could be present in so many
      distant wars. The remaining actions he intrusted to the care of
      his lieutenants, the judicious choice of whom forms no
      inconsiderable part of his glory. Carus, Diocletian, Maximian,
      Constantius, Galerius, Asclepiodatus, Annibalianus, and a crowd
      of other chiefs, who afterwards ascended or supported the throne,
      were trained to arms in the severe school of Aurelian and Probus.

      33 (return) [ Besides these well-known chiefs, several others are
      named by Vopiscus, (Hist. August. p. 241,) whose actions have not
      reached knowledge.]

      But the most important service which Probus rendered to the
      republic was the deliverance of Gaul, and the recovery of seventy
      flourishing cities oppressed by the barbarians of Germany, who,
      since the death of Aurelian, had ravaged that great province with
      impunity. 34 Among the various multitude of those fierce invaders
      we may distinguish, with some degree of clearness, three great
      armies, or rather nations, successively vanquished by the valor
      of Probus. He drove back the Franks into their morasses; a
      descriptive circumstance from whence we may infer, that the
      confederacy known by the manly appellation of _Free_, already
      occupied the flat maritime country, intersected and almost
      overflown by the stagnating waters of the Rhine, and that several
      tribes of the Frisians and Batavians had acceded to their
      alliance. He vanquished the Burgundians, a considerable people of
      the Vandalic race. 341 They had wandered in quest of booty from
      the banks of the Oder to those of the Seine. They esteemed
      themselves sufficiently fortunate to purchase, by the restitution
      of all their booty, the permission of an undisturbed retreat.
      They attempted to elude that article of the treaty. Their
      punishment was immediate and terrible. 35 But of all the invaders
      of Gaul, the most formidable were the Lygians, a distant people,
      who reigned over a wide domain on the frontiers of Poland and
      Silesia. 36 In the Lygian nation, the Arii held the first rank by
      their numbers and fierceness. “The Arii” (it is thus that they
      are described by the energy of Tacitus) “study to improve by art
      and circumstances the innate terrors of their barbarism. Their
      shields are black, their bodies are painted black. They choose
      for the combat the darkest hour of the night. Their host
      advances, covered as it were with a funeral shade; 37 nor do they
      often find an enemy capable of sustaining so strange and infernal
      an aspect. Of all our senses, the eyes are the first vanquished
      in battle.” 38 Yet the arms and discipline of the Romans easily
      discomfited these horrid phantoms. The Lygii were defeated in a
      general engagement, and Semno, the most renowned of their chiefs,
      fell alive into the hands of Probus. That prudent emperor,
      unwilling to reduce a brave people to despair, granted them an
      honorable capitulation, and permitted them to return in safety to
      their native country. But the losses which they suffered in the
      march, the battle, and the retreat, broke the power of the
      nation: nor is the Lygian name ever repeated in the history
      either of Germany or of the empire. The deliverance of Gaul is
      reported to have cost the lives of four hundred thousand of the
      invaders; a work of labor to the Romans, and of expense to the
      emperor, who gave a piece of gold for the head of every
      barbarian. 39 But as the fame of warriors is built on the
      destruction of human kind, we may naturally suspect that the
      sanguinary account was multiplied by the avarice of the soldiers,
      and accepted without any very severe examination by the liberal
      vanity of Probus.

      one fertile source of mistakes has been, that the Romans have

      Since the expedition of Maximin, the Roman generals had confined
      their ambition to a defensive war against the nations of Germany,
      who perpetually pressed on the frontiers of the empire. The more
      daring Probus pursued his Gallic victories, passed the Rhine, and
      displayed his invincible eagles on the banks of the Elbe and the
      Neckar. He was fully convinced that nothing could reconcile the
      minds of the barbarians to peace, unless they experienced, in
      their own country, the calamities of war. Germany, exhausted by
      the ill success of the last emigration, was astonished by his
      presence. Nine of the most considerable princes repaired to his
      camp, and fell prostrate at his feet. Such a treaty was humbly
      received by the Germans, as it pleased the conqueror to dictate.
      He exacted a strict restitution of the effects and captives which
      they had carried away from the provinces; and obliged their own
      magistrates to punish the more obstinate robbers who presumed to
      detain any part of the spoil. A considerable tribute of corn,
      cattle, and horses, the only wealth of barbarians, was reserved
      for the use of the garrisons which Probus established on the
      limits of their territory. He even entertained some thoughts of
      compelling the Germans to relinquish the exercise of arms, and to
      trust their differences to the justice, their safety to the
      power, of Rome. To accomplish these salutary ends, the constant
      residence of an Imperial governor, supported by a numerous army,
      was indispensably requisite. Probus therefore judged it more
      expedient to defer the execution of so great a design; which was
      indeed rather of specious than solid utility. 40 Had Germany been
      reduced into the state of a province, the Romans, with immense
      labor and expense, would have acquired only a more extensive
      boundary to defend against the fiercer and more active barbarians
      of Scythia.

      40 (return) [ Hist. August. 238, 239. Vopiscus quotes a letter
      from the emperor to the senate, in which he mentions his design
      of reducing Germany into a province.]

      Instead of reducing the warlike natives of Germany to the
      condition of subjects, Probus contented himself with the humble
      expedient of raising a bulwark against their inroads. The country
      which now forms the circle of Swabia had been left desert in the
      age of Augustus by the emigration of its ancient inhabitants. 41
      The fertility of the soil soon attracted a new colony from the
      adjacent provinces of Gaul. Crowds of adventurers, of a roving
      temper and of desperate fortunes, occupied the doubtful
      possession, and acknowledged, by the payment of tithes, the
      majesty of the empire. 42 To protect these new subjects, a line
      of frontier garrisons was gradually extended from the Rhine to
      the Danube. About the reign of Hadrian, when that mode of defence
      began to be practised, these garrisons were connected and covered
      by a strong intrenchment of trees and palisades. In the place of
      so rude a bulwark, the emperor Probus constructed a stone wall of
      a considerable height, and strengthened it by towers at
      convenient distances. From the neighborhood of Neustadt and
      Ratisbon on the Danube, it stretched across hills, valleys,
      rivers, and morasses, as far as Wimpfen on the Neckar, and at
      length terminated on the banks of the Rhine, after a winding
      course of near two hundred miles. 43 This important barrier,
      uniting the two mighty streams that protected the provinces of
      Europe, seemed to fill up the vacant space through which the
      barbarians, and particularly the Alemanni, could penetrate with
      the greatest facility into the heart of the empire. But the
      experience of the world, from China to Britain, has exposed the
      vain attempt of fortifying any extensive tract of country. 44 An
      active enemy, who can select and vary his points of attack, must,
      in the end, discover some feeble spot, or some unguarded moment.
      The strength, as well as the attention, of the defenders is
      divided; and such are the blind effects of terror on the firmest
      troops, that a line broken in a single place is almost instantly
      deserted. The fate of the wall which Probus erected may confirm
      the general observation. Within a few years after his death, it
      was overthrown by the Alemanni. Its scattered ruins, universally
      ascribed to the power of the Dæmon, now serve only to excite the
      wonder of the Swabian peasant.

      Among the useful conditions of peace imposed by Probus on the
      vanquished nations of Germany, was the obligation of supplying
      the Roman army with sixteen thousand recruits, the bravest and
      most robust of their youth. The emperor dispersed them through
      all the provinces, and distributed this dangerous reënforcement,
      in small bands of fifty or sixty each, among the national troops;
      judiciously observing, that the aid which the republic derived
      from the barbarians should be felt but not seen. 45 Their aid was
      now become necessary. The feeble elegance of Italy and the
      internal provinces could no longer support the weight of arms.
      The hardy frontiers of the Rhine and Danube still produced minds
      and bodies equal to the labors of the camp; but a perpetual
      series of wars had gradually diminished their numbers. The
      infrequency of marriage, and the ruin of agriculture, affected
      the principles of population, and not only destroyed the strength
      of the present, but intercepted the hope of future, generations.
      The wisdom of Probus embraced a great and beneficial plan of
      replenishing the exhausted frontiers, by new colonies of captive
      or fugitive barbarians, on whom he bestowed lands, cattle,
      instruments of husbandry, and every encouragement that might
      engage them to educate a race of soldiers for the service of the
      republic. Into Britain, and most probably into Cambridgeshire, 46
      he transported a considerable body of Vandals. The impossibility
      of an escape reconciled them to their situation, and in the
      subsequent troubles of that island, they approved themselves the
      most faithful servants of the state. 47 Great numbers of Franks
      and Gepidæ were settled on the banks of the Danube and the Rhine.
      A hundred thousand Bastarnæ, expelled from their own country,
      cheerfully accepted an establishment in Thrace, and soon imbibed
      the manners and sentiments of Roman subjects. 48 But the
      expectations of Probus were too often disappointed. The
      impatience and idleness of the barbarians could ill brook the
      slow labors of agriculture. Their unconquerable love of freedom,
      rising against despotism, provoked them into hasty rebellions,
      alike fatal to themselves and to the provinces; 49 nor could
      these artificial supplies, however repeated by succeeding
      emperors, restore the important limit of Gaul and Illyricum to
      its ancient and native vigor.

      Of all the barbarians who abandoned their new settlements, and
      disturbed the public tranquillity, a very small number returned
      to their own country. For a short season they might wander in
      arms through the empire; but in the end they were surely
      destroyed by the power of a warlike emperor. The successful
      rashness of a party of Franks was attended, however, with such
      memorable consequences, that it ought not to be passed unnoticed.
      They had been established by Probus, on the sea-coast of Pontus,
      with a view of strengthening the frontier against the inroads of
      the Alani. A fleet stationed in one of the harbors of the Euxine
      fell into the hands of the Franks; and they resolved, through
      unknown seas, to explore their way from the mouth of the Phasis
      to that of the Rhine. They easily escaped through the Bosphorus
      and the Hellespont, and cruising along the Mediterranean,
      indulged their appetite for revenge and plunder by frequent
      descents on the unsuspecting shores of Asia, Greece, and Africa.
      The opulent city of Syracuse, in whose port the navies of Athens
      and Carthage had formerly been sunk, was sacked by a handful of
      barbarians, who massacred the greatest part of the trembling
      inhabitants. From the island of Sicily the Franks proceeded to
      the columns of Hercules, trusted themselves to the ocean, coasted
      round Spain and Gaul, and steering their triumphant course
      through the British Channel, at length finished their surprising
      voyage, by landing in safety on the Batavian or Frisian shores.
      50 The example of their success, instructing their countrymen to
      conceive the advantages and to despise the dangers of the sea,
      pointed out to their enterprising spirit a new road to wealth and
      glory.

      Notwithstanding the vigilance and activity of Probus, it was
      almost impossible that he could at once contain in obedience
      every part of his wide-extended dominions. The barbarians, who
      broke their chains, had seized the favorable opportunity of a
      domestic war. When the emperor marched to the relief of Gaul, he
      devolved the command of the East on Saturninus. That general, a
      man of merit and experience, was driven into rebellion by the
      absence of his sovereign, the levity of the Alexandrian people,
      the pressing instances of his friends, and his own fears; but
      from the moment of his elevation, he never entertained a hope of
      empire, or even of life. “Alas!” he said, “the republic has lost
      a useful servant, and the rashness of an hour has destroyed the
      services of many years. You know not,” continued he, “the misery
      of sovereign power; a sword is perpetually suspended over our
      head. We dread our very guards, we distrust our companions. The
      choice of action or of repose is no longer in our disposition,
      nor is there any age, or character, or conduct, that can protect
      us from the censure of envy. In thus exalting me to the throne,
      you have doomed me to a life of cares, and to an untimely fate.
      The only consolation which remains is the assurance that I shall
      not fall alone.” 51 But as the former part of his prediction was
      verified by the victory, so the latter was disappointed by the
      clemency, of Probus. That amiable prince attempted even to save
      the unhappy Saturninus from the fury of the soldiers. He had more
      than once solicited the usurper himself to place some confidence
      in the mercy of a sovereign who so highly esteemed his character,
      that he had punished, as a malicious informer, the first who
      related the improbable news of his disaffection. 52 Saturninus
      might, perhaps, have embraced the generous offer, had he not been
      restrained by the obstinate distrust of his adherents. Their
      guilt was deeper, and their hopes more sanguine, than those of
      their experienced leader.

      52 (return) [ Zonaras, l. xii. p. 638.]

      The revolt of Saturninus was scarcely extinguished in the East,
      before new troubles were excited in the West, by the rebellion of
      Bonosus and Proculus, in Gaul. The most distinguished merit of
      those two officers was their respective prowess, of the one in
      the combats of Bacchus, of the other in those of Venus, 53 yet
      neither of them was destitute of courage and capacity, and both
      sustained, with honor, the august character which the fear of
      punishment had engaged them to assume, till they sunk at length
      beneath the superior genius of Probus. He used the victory with
      his accustomed moderation, and spared the fortune, as well as the
      lives of their innocent families. 54

      53 (return) [ A very surprising instance is recorded of the
      prowess of Proculus. He had taken one hundred Sarmatian virgins.
      The rest of the story he must relate in his own language: “Ex his
      una necte decem inivi; omnes tamen, quod in me erat, mulieres
      intra dies quindecim reddidi.” Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 246.]

      54 (return) [ Proculus, who was a native of Albengue, on the
      Genoese coast armed two thousand of his own slaves. His riches
      were great, but they were acquired by robbery. It was afterwards
      a saying of his family, sibi non placere esse vel principes vel
      latrones. Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 247.]

      The arms of Probus had now suppressed all the foreign and
      domestic enemies of the state. His mild but steady administration
      confirmed the re-ëstablishment of the public tranquillity; nor
      was there left in the provinces a hostile barbarian, a tyrant, or
      even a robber, to revive the memory of past disorders. It was
      time that the emperor should revisit Rome, and celebrate his own
      glory and the general happiness. The triumph due to the valor of
      Probus was conducted with a magnificence suitable to his fortune,
      and the people, who had so lately admired the trophies of
      Aurelian, gazed with equal pleasure on those of his heroic
      successor. 55 We cannot, on this occasion, forget the desperate
      courage of about fourscore gladiators, reserved, with near six
      hundred others, for the inhuman sports of the amphitheatre.
      Disdaining to shed their blood for the amusement of the populace,
      they killed their keepers, broke from the place of their
      confinement, and filled the streets of Rome with blood and
      confusion. After an obstinate resistance, they were overpowered
      and cut in pieces by the regular forces; but they obtained at
      least an honorable death, and the satisfaction of a just revenge.

      56 (return) [ Zosim. l. i. p. 66.]

      The military discipline which reigned in the camps of Probus was
      less cruel than that of Aurelian, but it was equally rigid and
      exact. The latter had punished the irregularities of the soldiers
      with unrelenting severity, the former prevented them by employing
      the legions in constant and useful labors. When Probus commanded
      in Egypt, he executed many considerable works for the splendor
      and benefit of that rich country. The navigation of the Nile, so
      important to Rome itself, was improved; and temples, buildings,
      porticos, and palaces, were constructed by the hands of the
      soldiers, who acted by turns as architects, as engineers, and as
      husbandmen. 57 It was reported of Hannibal, that, in order to
      preserve his troops from the dangerous temptations of idleness,
      he had obliged them to form large plantations of olive-trees
      along the coast of Africa. 58 From a similar principle, Probus
      exercised his legions in covering with rich vineyards the hills
      of Gaul and Pannonia, and two considerable spots are described,
      which were entirely dug and planted by military labor. 59 One of
      these, known under the name of Mount Almo, was situated near
      Sirmium, the country where Probus was born, for which he ever
      retained a partial affection, and whose gratitude he endeavored
      to secure, by converting into tillage a large and unhealthy tract
      of marshy ground. An army thus employed constituted perhaps the
      most useful, as well as the bravest, portion of Roman subjects.

      unnoticed by any more ancient writer, is irreconcilable with the
      history of his life. He left Africa when he was nine years old,

      army in the decisive battle of Zama. Livilus, xxx. 37.]

      But in the prosecution of a favorite scheme, the best of men,
      satisfied with the rectitude of their intentions, are subject to
      forget the bounds of moderation; nor did Probus himself
      sufficiently consult the patience and disposition of his fierce
      legionaries. 60 The dangers of the military profession seem only
      to be compensated by a life of pleasure and idleness; but if the
      duties of the soldier are incessantly aggravated by the labors of
      the peasant, he will at last sink under the intolerable burden,
      or shake it off with indignation. The imprudence of Probus is
      said to have inflamed the discontent of his troops. More
      attentive to the interests of mankind than to those of the army,
      he expressed the vain hope, that, by the establishment of
      universal peace, he should soon abolish the necessity of a
      standing and mercenary force. 61 The unguarded expression proved
      fatal to him. In one of the hottest days of summer, as he
      severely urged the unwholesome labor of draining the marshes of
      Sirmium, the soldiers, impatient of fatigue, on a sudden threw
      down their tools, grasped their arms, and broke out into a
      furious mutiny. The emperor, conscious of his danger, took refuge
      in a lofty tower, constructed for the purpose of surveying the
      progress of the work. 62 The tower was instantly forced, and a
      thousand swords were plunged at once into the bosom of the
      unfortunate Probus. The rage of the troops subsided as soon as it
      had been gratified. They then lamented their fatal rashness,
      forgot the severity of the emperor whom they had massacred, and
      hastened to perpetuate, by an honorable monument, the memory of
      his virtues and victories. 63

      60 (return) [ Julian bestows a severe, and indeed excessive,
      censure on the rigor of Probus, who, as he thinks, almost

      When the legions had indulged their grief and repentance for the
      death of Probus, their unanimous consent declared Carus, his
      Prætorian præfect, the most deserving of the Imperial throne.
      Every circumstance that relates to this prince appears of a mixed
      and doubtful nature. He gloried in the title of Roman Citizen;
      and affected to compare the purity of _his_ blood with the
      foreign and even barbarous origin of the preceding emperors; yet
      the most inquisitive of his contemporaries, very far from
      admitting his claim, have variously deduced his own birth, or
      that of his parents, from Illyricum, from Gaul, or from Africa.
      64 Though a soldier, he had received a learned education; though
      a senator, he was invested with the first dignity of the army;
      and in an age when the civil and military professions began to be
      irrecoverably separated from each other, they were united in the
      person of Carus. Notwithstanding the severe justice which he
      exercised against the assassins of Probus, to whose favor and
      esteem he was highly indebted, he could not escape the suspicion
      of being accessory to a deed from whence he derived the principal
      advantage. He enjoyed, at least before his elevation, an
      acknowledged character of virtue and abilities; 65 but his
      austere temper insensibly degenerated into moroseness and
      cruelty; and the imperfect writers of his life almost hesitate
      whether they shall not rank him in the number of Roman tyrants.
      66 When Carus assumed the purple, he was about sixty years of
      age, and his two sons, Carinus and Numerian had already attained
      the season of manhood. 67

      64 (return) [ Yet all this may be conciliated. He was born at
      Narbonne in Illyricum, confounded by Eutropius with the more
      famous city of that name in Gaul. His father might be an African,
      and his mother a noble Roman. Carus himself was educated in the
      capital. See Scaliger Animadversion. ad Euseb. Chron. p. 241.]

      65 (return) [ Probus had requested of the senate an equestrian
      statue and a marble palace, at the public expense, as a just
      recompense of the singular merit of Carus. Vopiscus in Hist.
      August. p. 249.]

      66 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 242, 249. Julian

      67 (return) [ John Malala, tom. i. p. 401. But the authority of
      that ignorant Greek is very slight. He ridiculously derives from
      Carus the city of Carrhæ, and the province of Caria, the latter
      of which is mentioned by Homer.]

      The authority of the senate expired with Probus; nor was the
      repentance of the soldiers displayed by the same dutiful regard
      for the civil power, which they had testified after the
      unfortunate death of Aurelian. The election of Carus was decided
      without expecting the approbation of the senate, and the new
      emperor contented himself with announcing, in a cold and stately
      epistle, that he had ascended the vacant throne. 68 A behavior so
      very opposite to that of his amiable predecessor afforded no
      favorable presage of the new reign: and the Romans, deprived of
      power and freedom, asserted their privilege of licentious
      murmurs. 69 The voice of congratulation and flattery was not,
      however, silent; and we may still peruse, with pleasure and
      contempt, an eclogue, which was composed on the accession of the
      emperor Carus. Two shepherds, avoiding the noontide heat, retire
      into the cave of Faunus. On a spreading beech they discover some
      recent characters. The rural deity had described, in prophetic
      verses, the felicity promised to the empire under the reign of so
      great a prince. Faunus hails the approach of that hero, who,
      receiving on his shoulders the sinking weight of the Roman world,
      shall extinguish war and faction, and once again restore the
      innocence and security of the golden age. 70

      It is more than probable, that these elegant trifles never
      reached the ears of a veteran general, who, with the consent of
      the legions, was preparing to execute the long-suspended design
      of the Persian war. Before his departure for this distant
      expedition, Carus conferred on his two sons, Carinus and
      Numerian, the title of Cæsar, and investing the former with
      almost an equal share of the Imperial power, directed the young
      prince first to suppress some troubles which had arisen in Gaul,
      and afterwards to fix the seat of his residence at Rome, and to
      assume the government of the Western provinces. 71 The safety of
      Illyricum was confirmed by a memorable defeat of the Sarmatians;
      sixteen thousand of those barbarians remained on the field of
      battle, and the number of captives amounted to twenty thousand.
      The old emperor, animated with the fame and prospect of victory,
      pursued his march, in the midst of winter, through the countries
      of Thrace and Asia Minor, and at length, with his younger son,
      Numerian, arrived on the confines of the Persian monarchy. There,
      encamping on the summit of a lofty mountain, he pointed out to
      his troops the opulence and luxury of the enemy whom they were
      about to invade.

      The successor of Artaxerxes, 711 Varanes, or Bahram, though he
      had subdued the Segestans, one of the most warlike nations of
      Upper Asia, 72 was alarmed at the approach of the Romans, and
      endeavored to retard their progress by a negotiation of peace.
      721

      His ambassadors entered the camp about sunset, at the time when
      the troops were satisfying their hunger with a frugal repast. The
      Persians expressed their desire of being introduced to the
      presence of the Roman emperor. They were at length conducted to a
      soldier, who was seated on the grass. A piece of stale bacon and
      a few hard peas composed his supper. A coarse woollen garment of
      purple was the only circumstance that announced his dignity. The
      conference was conducted with the same disregard of courtly
      elegance. Carus, taking off a cap which he wore to conceal his
      baldness, assured the ambassadors, that, unless their master
      acknowledged the superiority of Rome, he would speedily render
      Persia as naked of trees as his own head was destitute of hair.
      73 Notwithstanding some traces of art and preparation, we may
      discover in this scene the manners of Carus, and the severe
      simplicity which the martial princes, who succeeded Gallienus,
      had already restored in the Roman camps. The ministers of the
      Great King trembled and retired.

      721 (return) [ The manner in which his life was saved by the
      Chief Pontiff from a conspiracy of his nobles, is as remarkable
      as his saying. “By the advice (of the Pontiff) all the nobles
      absented themselves from court. The king wandered through his
      palace alone. He saw no one; all was silence around. He became
      alarmed and distressed. At last the Chief Pontiff appeared, and
      bowed his head in apparent misery, but spoke not a word. The king
      entreated him to declare what had happened. The virtuous man
      boldly related all that had passed, and conjured Bahram, in the
      name of his glorious ancestors, to change his conduct and save
      himself from destruction. The king was much moved, professed
      himself most penitent, and said he was resolved his future life
      should prove his sincerity. The overjoyed High Priest, delighted
      at this success, made a signal, at which all the nobles and
      attendants were in an instant, as if by magic, in their usual
      places. The monarch now perceived that only one opinion prevailed
      on his past conduct. He repeated therefore to his nobles all he
      had said to the Chief Pontiff, and his future reign was unstained
      by cruelty or oppression.” Malcolm’s Persia,—M.]

      73 (return) [ Synesius tells this story of Carinus; and it is
      much more natural to understand it of Carus, than (as Petavius
      and Tillemont choose to do) of Probus.]

      The threats of Carus were not without effect. He ravaged
      Mesopotamia, cut in pieces whatever opposed his passage, made
      himself master of the great cities of Seleucia and Ctesiphon,
      (which seemed to have surrendered without resistance,) and
      carried his victorious arms beyond the Tigris. 74 He had seized
      the favorable moment for an invasion. The Persian councils were
      distracted by domestic factions, and the greater part of their
      forces were detained on the frontiers of India. Rome and the East
      received with transport the news of such important advantages.
      Flattery and hope painted, in the most lively colors, the fall of
      Persia, the conquest of Arabia, the submission of Egypt, and a
      lasting deliverance from the inroads of the Scythian nations. 75
      But the reign of Carus was destined to expose the vanity of
      predictions. They were scarcely uttered before they were
      contradicted by his death; an event attended with such ambiguous
      circumstances, that it may be related in a letter from his own
      secretary to the præfect of the city. “Carus,” says he, “our
      dearest emperor, was confined by sickness to his bed, when a
      furious tempest arose in the camp. The darkness which overspread
      the sky was so thick, that we could no longer distinguish each
      other; and the incessant flashes of lightning took from us the
      knowledge of all that passed in the general confusion.
      Immediately after the most violent clap of thunder, we heard a
      sudden cry that the emperor was dead; and it soon appeared, that
      his chamberlains, in a rage of grief, had set fire to the royal
      pavilion; a circumstance which gave rise to the report that Carus
      was killed by lightning. But, as far as we have been able to
      investigate the truth, his death was the natural effect of his
      disorder.” 76

      75 (return) [ To the Persian victory of Carus I refer the
      dialogue of the Philopatris, which has so long been an object of
      dispute among the learned. But to explain and justify my opinion,
      would require a dissertation. Note: Niebuhr, in the new edition
      of the Byzantine Historians, (vol. x.) has boldly assigned the
      Philopatris to the tenth century, and to the reign of Nicephorus
      Phocas. An opinion so decisively pronounced by Niebuhr and
      favorably received by Hase, the learned editor of Leo Diaconus,
      commands respectful consideration. But the whole tone of the work
      appears to me altogether inconsistent with any period in which
      philosophy did not stand, as it were, on some ground of equality
      with Christianity. The doctrine of the Trinity is sarcastically
      introduced rather as the strange doctrine of a new religion, than
      the established tenet of a faith universally prevalent. The
      argument, adopted from Solanus, concerning the formula of the
      procession of the Holy Ghost, is utterly worthless, as it is a
      mere quotation in the words of the Gospel of St. John, xv. 26.
      The only argument of any value is the historic one, from the
      allusion to the recent violation of many virgins in the Island of
      Crete. But neither is the language of Niebuhr quite accurate, nor
      his reference to the Acroases of Theodosius satisfactory. When,
      then, could this occurrence take place? Why not in the
      devastation of the island by the Gothic pirates, during the reign
      of Claudius. Hist. Aug. in Claud. p. 814. edit. Var. Lugd. Bat

      Chapter XII: Reigns Of Tacitus, Probus, Carus And His Sons.—Part
      III.

      The vacancy of the throne was not productive of any disturbance.
      The ambition of the aspiring generals was checked by their
      natural fears, and young Numerian, with his absent brother
      Carinus, were unanimously acknowledged as Roman emperors.

      The public expected that the successor of Carus would pursue his
      father’s footsteps, and, without allowing the Persians to recover
      from their consternation, would advance sword in hand to the
      palaces of Susa and Ecbatana. 77 But the legions, however strong
      in numbers and discipline, were dismayed by the most abject
      superstition. Notwithstanding all the arts that were practised to
      disguise the manner of the late emperor’s death, it was found
      impossible to remove the opinion of the multitude, and the power
      of opinion is irresistible. Places or persons struck with
      lightning were considered by the ancients with pious horror, as
      singularly devoted to the wrath of Heaven. 78 An oracle was
      remembered, which marked the River Tigris as the fatal boundary
      of the Roman arms. The troops, terrified with the fate of Carus
      and with their own danger, called aloud on young Numerian to obey
      the will of the gods, and to lead them away from this
      inauspicious scene of war. The feeble emperor was unable to
      subdue their obstinate prejudice, and the Persians wondered at
      the unexpected retreat of a victorious enemy. 79

      77 (return) [ See Nemesian. Cynegeticon, v. 71, &c.]

      78 (return) [ See Festus and his commentators on the word

      79 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 250. Aurelius Victor
      seems to believe the prediction, and to approve the retreat.]

      The intelligence of the mysterious fate of the late emperor was
      soon carried from the frontiers of Persia to Rome; and the
      senate, as well as the provinces, congratulated the accession of
      the sons of Carus. These fortunate youths were strangers,
      however, to that conscious superiority, either of birth or of
      merit, which can alone render the possession of a throne easy,
      and, as it were, natural. Born and educated in a private station,
      the election of their father raised them at once to the rank of
      princes; and his death, which happened about sixteen months
      afterwards, left them the unexpected legacy of a vast empire. To
      sustain with temper this rapid elevation, an uncommon share of
      virtue and prudence was requisite; and Carinus, the elder of the
      brothers, was more than commonly deficient in those qualities. In
      the Gallic war he discovered some degree of personal courage; 80
      but from the moment of his arrival at Rome, he abandoned himself
      to the luxury of the capital, and to the abuse of his fortune. He
      was soft, yet cruel; devoted to pleasure, but destitute of taste;
      and though exquisitely susceptible of vanity, indifferent to the
      public esteem. In the course of a few months, he successively
      married and divorced nine wives, most of whom he left pregnant;
      and notwithstanding this legal inconstancy, found time to indulge
      such a variety of irregular appetites, as brought dishonor on
      himself and on the noblest houses of Rome. He beheld with
      inveterate hatred all those who might remember his former
      obscurity, or censure his present conduct. He banished, or put to
      death, the friends and counsellors whom his father had placed
      about him, to guide his inexperienced youth; and he persecuted
      with the meanest revenge his school-fellows and companions who
      had not sufficiently respected the latent majesty of the emperor.

      With the senators, Carinus affected a lofty and regal demeanor,
      frequently declaring, that he designed to distribute their
      estates among the populace of Rome. From the dregs of that
      populace he selected his favorites, and even his ministers. The
      palace, and even the Imperial table, were filled with singers,
      dancers, prostitutes, and all the various retinue of vice and
      folly. One of his doorkeepers 81 he intrusted with the government
      of the city. In the room of the Prætorian præfect, whom he put to
      death, Carinus substituted one of the ministers of his looser
      pleasures. Another, who possessed the same, or even a more
      infamous, title to favor, was invested with the consulship. A
      confidential secretary, who had acquired uncommon skill in the
      art of forgery, delivered the indolent emperor, with his own
      consent from the irksome duty of signing his name.

      When the emperor Carus undertook the Persian war, he was induced,
      by motives of affection as well as policy, to secure the fortunes
      of his family, by leaving in the hands of his eldest son the
      armies and provinces of the West. The intelligence which he soon
      received of the conduct of Carinus filled him with shame and
      regret; nor had he concealed his resolution of satisfying the
      republic by a severe act of justice, and of adopting, in the
      place of an unworthy son, the brave and virtuous Constantius, who
      at that time was governor of Dalmatia. But the elevation of
      Constantius was for a while deferred; and as soon as the father’s
      death had released Carinus from the control of fear or decency,
      he displayed to the Romans the extravagancies of Elagabalus,
      aggravated by the cruelty of Domitian. 82

      x. 19. Vic to Junior. The reign of Diocletian indeed was so long
      and prosperous, that it must have been very unfavorable to the
      reputation of Carinus.]

      The only merit of the administration of Carinus that history
      could record, or poetry celebrate, was the uncommon splendor with
      which, in his own and his brother’s name, he exhibited the Roman
      games of the theatre, the circus, and the amphitheatre. More than
      twenty years afterwards, when the courtiers of Diocletian
      represented to their frugal sovereign the fame and popularity of
      his munificent predecessor, he acknowledged that the reign of
      Carinus had indeed been a reign of pleasure. 83 But this vain
      prodigality, which the prudence of Diocletian might justly
      despise, was enjoyed with surprise and transport by the Roman
      people. The oldest of the citizens, recollecting the spectacles
      of former days, the triumphal pomp of Probus or Aurelian, and the
      secular games of the emperor Philip, acknowledged that they were
      all surpassed by the superior magnificence of Carinus. 84

      83 (return) [ Vopiscus in Hist. August. p. 254. He calls him
      Carus, but the sense is sufficiently obvious, and the words were
      often confounded.]

      84 (return) [ See Calphurnius, Eclog. vii. 43. We may observe,
      that the spectacles of Probus were still recent, and that the
      poet is seconded by the historian.]

      The spectacles of Carinus may therefore be best illustrated by
      the observation of some particulars, which history has
      condescended to relate concerning those of his predecessors. If
      we confine ourselves solely to the hunting of wild beasts,
      however we may censure the vanity of the design or the cruelty of
      the execution, we are obliged to confess that neither before nor
      since the time of the Romans so much art and expense have ever
      been lavished for the amusement of the people. 85 By the order of
      Probus, a great quantity of large trees, torn up by the roots,
      were transplanted into the midst of the circus. The spacious and
      shady forest was immediately filled with a thousand ostriches, a
      thousand stags, a thousand fallow deer, and a thousand wild
      boars; and all this variety of game was abandoned to the riotous
      impetuosity of the multitude. The tragedy of the succeeding day
      consisted in the massacre of a hundred lions, an equal number of
      lionesses, two hundred leopards, and three hundred bears. 86 The
      collection prepared by the younger Gordian for his triumph, and
      which his successor exhibited in the secular games, was less
      remarkable by the number than by the singularity of the animals.
      Twenty zebras displayed their elegant forms and variegated beauty
      to the eyes of the Roman people. 87 Ten elks, and as many
      camelopards, the loftiest and most harmless creatures that wander
      over the plains of Sarmatia and Æthiopia, were contrasted with
      thirty African hyænas and ten Indian tigers, the most implacable
      savages of the torrid zone. The unoffending strength with which
      Nature has endowed the greater quadrupeds was admired in the
      rhinoceros, the hippopotamus of the Nile, 88 and a majestic troop
      of thirty-two elephants. 89 While the populace gazed with stupid
      wonder on the splendid show, the naturalist might indeed observe
      the figure and properties of so many different species,
      transported from every part of the ancient world into the
      amphitheatre of Rome. But this accidental benefit, which science
      might derive from folly, is surely insufficient to justify such a
      wanton abuse of the public riches. There occurs, however, a
      single instance in the first Punic war, in which the senate
      wisely connected this amusement of the multitude with the
      interest of the state. A considerable number of elephants, taken
      in the defeat of the Carthaginian army, were driven through the
      circus by a few slaves, armed only with blunt javelins. 90 The
      useful spectacle served to impress the Roman soldier with a just
      contempt for those unwieldy animals; and he no longer dreaded to
      encounter them in the ranks of war.

      The hunting or exhibition of wild beasts was conducted with a
      magnificence suitable to a people who styled themselves the
      masters of the world; nor was the edifice appropriated to that
      entertainment less expressive of Roman greatness. Posterity
      admires, and will long admire, the awful remains of the
      amphitheatre of Titus, which so well deserved the epithet of
      Colossal. 91 It was a building of an elliptic figure, five
      hundred and sixty-four feet in length, and four hundred and
      sixty-seven in breadth, founded on fourscore arches, and rising,
      with four successive orders of architecture, to the height of one
      hundred and forty feet. 92 The outside of the edifice was
      encrusted with marble, and decorated with statues. The slopes of
      the vast concave, which formed the inside, were filled and
      surrounded with sixty or eighty rows of seats of marble likewise,
      covered with cushions, and capable of receiving with ease about
      fourscore thousand spectators. 93 Sixty-four _vomitories_ (for by
      that name the doors were very aptly distinguished) poured forth
      the immense multitude; and the entrances, passages, and
      staircases were contrived with such exquisite skill, that each
      person, whether of the senatorial, the equestrian, or the
      plebeian order, arrived at his destined place without trouble or
      confusion. 94 Nothing was omitted, which, in any respect, could
      be subservient to the convenience and pleasure of the spectators.

      They were protected from the sun and rain by an ample canopy,
      occasionally drawn over their heads. The air was continally
      refreshed by the playing of fountains, and profusely impregnated
      by the grateful scent of aromatics. In the centre of the edifice,
      the _arena_, or stage, was strewed with the finest sand, and
      successively assumed the most different forms. At one moment it
      seemed to rise out of the earth, like the garden of the
      Hesperides, and was afterwards broken into the rocks and caverns
      of Thrace. The subterraneous pipes conveyed an inexhaustible
      supply of water; and what had just before appeared a level plain,
      might be suddenly converted into a wide lake, covered with armed
      vessels, and replenished with the monsters of the deep. 95 In the
      decoration of these scenes, the Roman emperors displayed their
      wealth and liberality; and we read on various occasions that the
      whole furniture of the amphitheatre consisted either of silver,
      or of gold, or of amber. 96 The poet who describes the games of
      Carinus, in the character of a shepherd, attracted to the capital
      by the fame of their magnificence, affirms that the nets designed
      as a defence against the wild beasts were of gold wire; that the
      porticos were gilded; and that the _belt_ or circle which divided
      the several ranks of spectators from each other was studded with
      a precious mosaic of beautiful stones. 97

      In the midst of this glittering pageantry, the emperor Carinus,
      secure of his fortune, enjoyed the acclamations of the people,
      the flattery of his courtiers, and the songs of the poets, who,
      for want of a more essential merit, were reduced to celebrate the
      divine graces of his person. 98 In the same hour, but at the
      distance of nine hundred miles from Rome, his brother expired;
      and a sudden revolution transferred into the hands of a stranger
      the sceptre of the house of Carus. 99

      98 (return) [ Et Martis vultus et Apollinis esse putavi, says
      Calphurnius; but John Malala, who had perhaps seen pictures of

      403.]

      99 (return) [ With regard to the time when these Roman games were
      celebrated, Scaliger, Salmasius, and Cuper have given themselves

      The sons of Carus never saw each other after their father’s
      death. The arrangements which their new situation required were
      probably deferred till the return of the younger brother to Rome,
      where a triumph was decreed to the young emperors for the
      glorious success of the Persian war. 100 It is uncertain whether
      they intended to divide between them the administration, or the
      provinces, of the empire; but it is very unlikely that their
      union would have proved of any long duration. The jealousy of
      power must have been inflamed by the opposition of characters. In
      the most corrupt of times, Carinus was unworthy to live: Numerian
      deserved to reign in a happier period. His affable manners and
      gentle virtues secured him, as soon as they became known, the
      regard and affections of the public. He possessed the elegant
      accomplishments of a poet and orator, which dignify as well as
      adorn the humblest and the most exalted station. His eloquence,
      however it was applauded by the senate, was formed not so much on
      the model of Cicero, as on that of the modern declaimers; but in
      an age very far from being destitute of poetical merit, he
      contended for the prize with the most celebrated of his
      contemporaries, and still remained the friend of his rivals; a
      circumstance which evinces either the goodness of his heart, or
      the superiority of his genius. 101 But the talents of Numerian
      were rather of the contemplative than of the active kind. When
      his father’s elevation reluctantly forced him from the shade of
      retirement, neither his temper nor his pursuits had qualified him
      for the command of armies. His constitution was destroyed by the
      hardships of the Persian war; and he had contracted, from the
      heat of the climate, 102 such a weakness in his eyes, as obliged
      him, in the course of a long retreat, to confine himself to the
      solitude and darkness of a tent or litter.

      The administration of all affairs, civil as well as military, was
      devolved on Arrius Aper, the Prætorian præfect, who to the power
      of his important office added the honor of being father-in-law to
      Numerian. The Imperial pavilion was strictly guarded by his most
      trusty adherents; and during many days, Aper delivered to the
      army the supposed mandates of their invisible sovereign. 103

      100 (return) [ Nemesianus (in the Cynegeticon) seems to
      anticipate in his fancy that auspicious day.]

      101 (return) [ He won all the crowns from Nemesianus, with whom
      he vied in didactic poetry. The senate erected a statue to the

      102 (return) [ A more natural cause, at least, than that assigned

      103 (return) [ In the Persian war, Aper was suspected of a design
      to betray Carus. Hist. August. p. 250.]

      It was not till eight months after the death of Carus, that the
      Roman army, returning by slow marches from the banks of the
      Tigris, arrived on those of the Thracian Bosphorus. The legions
      halted at Chalcedon in Asia, while the court passed over to
      Heraclea, on the European side of the Propontis. 104 But a report
      soon circulated through the camp, at first in secret whispers,
      and at length in loud clamors, of the emperor’s death, and of the
      presumption of his ambitious minister, who still exercised the
      sovereign power in the name of a prince who was no more. The
      impatience of the soldiers could not long support a state of
      suspense. With rude curiosity they broke into the Imperial tent,
      and discovered only the corpse of Numerian. 105 The gradual
      decline of his health might have induced them to believe that his
      death was natural; but the concealment was interpreted as an
      evidence of guilt, and the measures which Aper had taken to
      secure his election became the immediate occasion of his ruin.
      Yet, even in the transport of their rage and grief, the troops
      observed a regular proceeding, which proves how firmly discipline
      had been reëstablished by the martial successors of Gallienus. A
      general assembly of the army was appointed to be held at
      Chalcedon, whither Aper was transported in chains, as a prisoner
      and a criminal. A vacant tribunal was erected in the midst of the
      camp, and the generals and tribunes formed a great military
      council. They soon announced to the multitude that their choice
      had fallen on Diocletian, commander of the domestics or
      body-guards, as the person the most capable of revenging and
      succeeding their beloved emperor. The future fortunes of the
      candidate depended on the chance or conduct of the present hour.
      Conscious that the station which he had filled exposed him to
      some suspicions, Diocletian ascended the tribunal, and raising
      his eyes towards the Sun, made a solemn profession of his own
      innocence, in the presence of that all-seeing Deity. 106 Then,
      assuming the tone of a sovereign and a judge, he commanded that
      Aper should be brought in chains to the foot of the tribunal.
      “This man,” said he, “is the murderer of Numerian;” and without
      giving him time to enter on a dangerous justification, drew his
      sword, and buried it in the breast of the unfortunate præfect. A
      charge supported by such decisive proof was admitted without
      contradiction, and the legions, with repeated acclamations,
      acknowledged the justice and authority of the emperor Diocletian.

      Before we enter upon the memorable reign of that prince, it will
      be proper to punish and dismiss the unworthy brother of Numerian.
      Carinus possessed arms and treasures sufficient to support his
      legal title to the empire. But his personal vices overbalanced
      every advantage of birth and situation. The most faithful
      servants of the father despised the incapacity, and dreaded the
      cruel arrogance, of the son. The hearts of the people were
      engaged in favor of his rival, and even the senate was inclined
      to prefer a usurper to a tyrant. The arts of Diocletian inflamed
      the general discontent; and the winter was employed in secret
      intrigues, and open preparations for a civil war. In the spring,
      the forces of the East and of the West encountered each other in
      the plains of Margus, a small city of Mæsia, in the neighborhood
      of the Danube. 108 The troops, so lately returned from the
      Persian war, had acquired their glory at the expense of health
      and numbers; nor were they in a condition to contend with the
      unexhausted strength of the legions of Europe. Their ranks were
      broken, and, for a moment, Diocletian despaired of the purple and
      of life. But the advantage which Carinus had obtained by the
      valor of his soldiers, he quickly lost by the infidelity of his
      officers. A tribune, whose wife he had seduced, seized the
      opportunity of revenge, and, by a single blow, extinguished civil
      discord in the blood of the adulterer. 109
