      The loss of Constantinople restored a momentary vigor to the
      Greeks. From their palaces, the princes and nobles were driven
      into the field; and the fragments of the falling monarchy were
      grasped by the hands of the most vigorous or the most skilful
      candidates. In the long and barren pages of the Byzantine annals,
      1 it would not be an easy task to equal the two characters of
      Theodore Lascaris and John Ducas Vataces, 2 who replanted and
      upheld the Roman standard at Nice in Bithynia. The difference of
      their virtues was happily suited to the diversity of their
      situation. In his first efforts, the fugitive Lascaris commanded
      only three cities and two thousand soldiers: his reign was the
      season of generous and active despair: in every military
      operation he staked his life and crown; and his enemies of the
      Hellespont and the Mæander, were surprised by his celerity and
      subdued by his boldness. A victorious reign of eighteen years
      expanded the principality of Nice to the magnitude of an empire.
      The throne of his successor and son-in-law Vataces was founded on
      a more solid basis, a larger scope, and more plentiful resources;
      and it was the temper, as well as the interest, of Vataces to
      calculate the risk, to expect the moment, and to insure the
      success, of his ambitious designs. In the decline of the Latins,
      I have briefly exposed the progress of the Greeks; the prudent
      and gradual advances of a conqueror, who, in a reign of
      thirty-three years, rescued the provinces from national and
      foreign usurpers, till he pressed on all sides the Imperial city,
      a leafless and sapless trunk, which must full at the first stroke
      of the axe. But his interior and peaceful administration is still
      more deserving of notice and praise. 3 The calamities of the
      times had wasted the numbers and the substance of the Greeks; the
      motives and the means of agriculture were extirpated; and the
      most fertile lands were left without cultivation or inhabitants.
      A portion of this vacant property was occupied and improved by
      the command, and for the benefit, of the emperor: a powerful hand
      and a vigilant eye supplied and surpassed, by a skilful
      management, the minute diligence of a private farmer: the royal
      domain became the garden and granary of Asia; and without
      impoverishing the people, the sovereign acquired a fund of
      innocent and productive wealth. According to the nature of the
      soil, his lands were sown with corn or planted with vines; the
      pastures were filled with horses and oxen, with sheep and hogs;
      and when Vataces presented to the empress a crown of diamonds and
      pearls, he informed her, with a smile, that this precious
      ornament arose from the sale of the eggs of his innumerable
      poultry. The produce of his domain was applied to the maintenance
      of his palace and hospitals, the calls of dignity and
      benevolence: the lesson was still more useful than the revenue:
      the plough was restored to its ancient security and honor; and
      the nobles were taught to seek a sure and independent revenue
      from their estates, instead of adorning their splendid beggary by
      the oppression of the people, or (what is almost the same) by the
      favors of the court. The superfluous stock of corn and cattle was
      eagerly purchased by the Turks, with whom Vataces preserved a
      strict and sincere alliance; but he discouraged the importation
      of foreign manufactures, the costly silks of the East, and the
      curious labors of the Italian looms. “The demands of nature and
      necessity,” was he accustomed to say, “are indispensable; but the
      influence of fashion may rise and sink at the breath of a
      monarch;” and both his precept and example recommended simplicity
      of manners and the use of domestic industry. The education of
      youth and the revival of learning were the most serious objects
      of his care; and, without deciding the precedency, he pronounced
      with truth, that a prince and a philosopher 4 are the two most
      eminent characters of human society. His first wife was Irene,
      the daughter of Theodore Lascaris, a woman more illustrious by
      her personal merit, the milder virtues of her sex, than by the
      blood of the Angeli and Comneni that flowed in her veins, and
      transmitted the inheritance of the empire. After her death he was
      contracted to Anne, or Constance, a natural daughter of the
      emperor Frederic 499 the Second; but as the bride had not
      attained the years of puberty, Vataces placed in his solitary bed
      an Italian damsel of her train; and his amorous weakness bestowed
      on the concubine the honors, though not the title, of a lawful
      empress. His frailty was censured as a flagitious and damnable
      sin by the monks; and their rude invectives exercised and
      displayed the patience of the royal lover. A philosophic age may
      excuse a single vice, which was redeemed by a crowd of virtues;
      and in the review of his faults, and the more intemperate
      passions of Lascaris, the judgment of their contemporaries was
      softened by gratitude to the second founders of the empire. 5 The
      slaves of the Latins, without law or peace, applauded the
      happiness of their brethren who had resumed their national
      freedom; and Vataces employed the laudable policy of convincing
      the Greeks of every dominion that it was their interest to be
      enrolled in the number of his subjects.

      A strong shade of degeneracy is visible between John Vataces and
      his son Theodore; between the founder who sustained the weight,
      and the heir who enjoyed the splendor, of the Imperial crown. 6
      Yet the character of Theodore was not devoid of energy; he had
      been educated in the school of his father, in the exercise of war
      and hunting; Constantinople was yet spared; but in the three
      years of a short reign, he thrice led his armies into the heart
      of Bulgaria. His virtues were sullied by a choleric and
      suspicious temper: the first of these may be ascribed to the
      ignorance of control; and the second might naturally arise from a
      dark and imperfect view of the corruption of mankind. On a march
      in Bulgaria, he consulted on a question of policy his principal
      ministers; and the Greek logothete, George Acropolita, presumed
      to offend him by the declaration of a free and honest opinion.
      The emperor half unsheathed his cimeter; but his more deliberate
      rage reserved Acropolita for a baser punishment. One of the first
      officers of the empire was ordered to dismount, stripped of his
      robes, and extended on the ground in the presence of the prince
      and army. In this posture he was chastised with so many and such
      heavy blows from the clubs of two guards or executioners, that
      when Theodore commanded them to cease, the great logothete was
      scarcely able to rise and crawl away to his tent. After a
      seclusion of some days, he was recalled by a peremptory mandate
      to his seat in council; and so dead were the Greeks to the sense
      of honor and shame, that it is from the narrative of the sufferer
      himself that we acquire the knowledge of his disgrace. 7 The
      cruelty of the emperor was exasperated by the pangs of sickness,
      the approach of a premature end, and the suspicion of poison and
      magic. The lives and fortunes, the eyes and limbs, of his kinsmen
      and nobles, were sacrificed to each sally of passion; and before
      he died, the son of Vataces might deserve from the people, or at
      least from the court, the appellation of tyrant. A matron of the
      family of the Palæologi had provoked his anger by refusing to
      bestow her beauteous daughter on the vile plebeian who was
      recommended by his caprice. Without regard to her birth or age,
      her body, as high as the neck, was enclosed in a sack with
      several cats, who were pricked with pins to irritate their fury
      against their unfortunate fellow-captive. In his last hours the
      emperor testified a wish to forgive and be forgiven, a just
      anxiety for the fate of John his son and successor, who, at the
      age of eight years, was condemned to the dangers of a long
      minority. His last choice intrusted the office of guardian to the
      sanctity of the patriarch Arsenius, and to the courage of George
      Muzalon, the great domestic, who was equally distinguished by the
      royal favor and the public hatred. Since their connection with
      the Latins, the names and privileges of hereditary rank had
      insinuated themselves into the Greek monarchy; and the noble
      families 8 were provoked by the elevation of a worthless
      favorite, to whose influence they imputed the errors and
      calamities of the late reign. In the first council, after the
      emperor’s death, Muzalon, from a lofty throne, pronounced a
      labored apology of his conduct and intentions: his modesty was
      subdued by a unanimous assurance of esteem and fidelity; and his
      most inveterate enemies were the loudest to salute him as the
      guardian and savior of the Romans. Eight days were sufficient to
      prepare the execution of the conspiracy. On the ninth, the
      obsequies of the deceased monarch were solemnized in the
      cathedral of Magnesia, 9 an Asiatic city, where he expired, on
      the banks of the Hermus, and at the foot of Mount Sipylus. The
      holy rites were interrupted by a sedition of the guards; Muzalon,
      his brothers, and his adherents, were massacred at the foot of
      the altar; and the absent patriarch was associated with a new
      colleague, with Michael Palæologus, the most illustrious, in
      birth and merit, of the Greek nobles. 10

      6 (return) [ A Persian saying, that Cyrus was the _father_ and
      Darius the _master_, of his subjects, was applied to Vataces and
      his son. But Pachymer (l. i. c. 23) has mistaken the mild Darius
      for the cruel Cambyses, despot or tyrant of his people. By the
      institution of taxes, Darius had incurred the less odious, but
      more contemptible, name of KaphloV, merchant or broker,
      (Herodotus, iii. 89.)]

      7 (return) [ Acropolita (c. 63) seems to admire his own firmness
      in sustaining a beating, and not returning to council till he was
      called. He relates the exploits of Theodore, and his own
      services, from c. 53 to c. 74 of his history. See the third book
      of Nicephorus Gregoras.]

      decoration, a figurative or a real golden chain? Perhaps, both.]

      9 (return) [ The old geographers, with Cellarius and D’Anville,
      and our travellers, particularly Pocock and Chandler, will teach
      us to distinguish the two Magnesias of Asia Minor, of the Mæander
      and of Sipylus. The latter, our present object, is still
      flourishing for a Turkish city, and lies eight hours, or leagues,
      to the north-east of Smyrna, (Tournefort, Voyage du Levant, tom.
      iii. lettre xxii. p. 365—370. Chandler’s Travels into Asia Minor,
      p. 267.)]

      10 (return) [ See Acropolita, (c. 75, 76, &c.,) who lived too
      near the times; Pachymer, (l. i. c. 13—25,) Gregoras, (l. iii. c.
      3, 4, 5.)]

      Of those who are proud of their ancestors, the far greater part
      must be content with local or domestic renown; and few there are
      who dare trust the memorials of their family to the public annals
      of their country. As early as the middle of the eleventh century,
      the noble race of the Palæologi 11 stands high and conspicuous in
      the Byzantine history: it was the valiant George Palæologus who
      placed the father of the Comneni on the throne; and his kinsmen
      or descendants continue, in each generation, to lead the armies
      and councils of the state. The purple was not dishonored by their
      alliance, and had the law of succession, and female succession,
      been strictly observed, the wife of Theodore Lascaris must have
      yielded to her elder sister, the mother of Michael Palæologus,
      who afterwards raised his family to the throne. In his person,
      the splendor of birth was dignified by the merit of the soldier
      and statesman: in his early youth he was promoted to the office
      of _constable_ or commander of the French mercenaries; the
      private expense of a day never exceeded three pieces of gold; but
      his ambition was rapacious and profuse; and his gifts were
      doubled by the graces of his conversation and manners. The love
      of the soldiers and people excited the jealousy of the court, and
      Michael thrice escaped from the dangers in which he was involved
      by his own imprudence or that of his friends. I. Under the reign
      of Justice and Vataces, a dispute arose 12 between two officers,
      one of whom accused the other of maintaining the hereditary right
      of the Palæologi The cause was decided, according to the new
      jurisprudence of the Latins, by single combat; the defendant was
      overthrown; but he persisted in declaring that himself alone was
      guilty; and that he had uttered these rash or treasonable
      speeches without the approbation or knowledge of his patron. Yet
      a cloud of suspicion hung over the innocence of the constable; he
      was still pursued by the whispers of malevolence; and a subtle
      courtier, the archbishop of Philadelphia, urged him to accept the
      judgment of God in the fiery proof of the ordeal. 13 Three days
      before the trial, the patient’s arm was enclosed in a bag, and
      secured by the royal signet; and it was incumbent on him to bear
      a red-hot ball of iron three times from the altar to the rails of
      the sanctuary, without artifice and without injury. Palæologus
      eluded the dangerous experiment with sense and pleasantry. “I am
      a soldier,” said he, “and will boldly enter the lists with my
      accusers; but a layman, a sinner like myself, is not endowed with
      the gift of miracles. _Your_ piety, most holy prelate, may
      deserve the interposition of Heaven, and from your hands I will
      receive the fiery globe, the pledge of my innocence.” The
      archbishop started; the emperor smiled; and the absolution or
      pardon of Michael was approved by new rewards and new services.
      II. In the succeeding reign, as he held the government of Nice,
      he was secretly informed, that the mind of the absent prince was
      poisoned with jealousy; and that death, or blindness, would be
      his final reward. Instead of awaiting the return and sentence of
      Theodore, the constable, with some followers, escaped from the
      city and the empire; and though he was plundered by the Turkmans
      of the desert, he found a hospitable refuge in the court of the
      sultan. In the ambiguous state of an exile, Michael reconciled
      the duties of gratitude and loyalty: drawing his sword against
      the Tartars; admonishing the garrisons of the Roman limit; and
      promoting, by his influence, the restoration of peace, in which
      his pardon and recall were honorably included. III. While he
      guarded the West against the despot of Epirus, Michael was again
      suspected and condemned in the palace; and such was his loyalty
      or weakness, that he submitted to be led in chains above six
      hundred miles from Durazzo to Nice. The civility of the messenger
      alleviated his disgrace; the emperor’s sickness dispelled his
      danger; and the last breath of Theodore, which recommended his
      infant son, at once acknowledged the innocence and the power of
      Palæologus.

      11 (return) [ The pedigree of Palæologus is explained by Ducange,
      (Famil. Byzant. p. 230, &c.:) the events of his private life are
      related by Pachymer (l. i. c. 7—12) and Gregoras (l. ii. 8, l.
      iii. 2, 4, l. iv. 1) with visible favor to the father of the
      reigning dynasty.]

      12 (return) [ Acropolita (c. 50) relates the circumstances of
      this curious adventure, which seem to have escaped the more
      recent writers.]

      13 (return) [ Pachymer, (l. i. c. 12,) who speaks with proper
      contempt of this barbarous trial, affirms, that he had seen in
      his youth many person who had sustained, without injury, the
      fiery ordeal. As a Greek, he is credulous; but the ingenuity of
      the Greeks might furnish some remedies of art or fraud against
      their own superstition, or that of their tyrant.]

      But his innocence had been too unworthily treated, and his power
      was too strongly felt, to curb an aspiring subject in the fair
      field that was opened to his ambition. 14 In the council, after
      the death of Theodore, he was the first to pronounce, and the
      first to violate, the oath of allegiance to Muzalon; and so
      dexterous was his conduct, that he reaped the benefit, without
      incurring the guilt, or at least the reproach, of the subsequent
      massacre. In the choice of a regent, he balanced the interests
      and passions of the candidates; turned their envy and hatred from
      himself against each other, and forced every competitor to own,
      that after his own claims, those of Palæologus were best entitled
      to the preference. Under the title of great duke, he accepted or
      assumed, during a long minority, the active powers of government;
      the patriarch was a venerable name; and the factious nobles were
      seduced, or oppressed, by the ascendant of his genius. The fruits
      of the economy of Vataces were deposited in a strong castle on
      the banks of the Hermus, in the custody of the faithful
      Varangians: the constable retained his command or influence over
      the foreign troops; he employed the guards to possess the
      treasure, and the treasure to corrupt the guards; and whatsoever
      might be the abuse of the public money, his character was above
      the suspicion of private avarice. By himself, or by his
      emissaries, he strove to persuade every rank of subjects, that
      their own prosperity would rise in just proportion to the
      establishment of his authority. The weight of taxes was
      suspended, the perpetual theme of popular complaint; and he
      prohibited the trials by the ordeal and judicial combat. These
      Barbaric institutions were already abolished or undermined in
      France 15 and England; 16 and the appeal to the sword offended
      the sense of a civilized, 17 and the temper of an unwarlike,
      people. For the future maintenance of their wives and children,
      the veterans were grateful: the priests and the philosophers
      applauded his ardent zeal for the advancement of religion and
      learning; and his vague promise of rewarding merit was applied by
      every candidate to his own hopes. Conscious of the influence of
      the clergy, Michael successfully labored to secure the suffrage
      of that powerful order. Their expensive journey from Nice to
      Magnesia, afforded a decent and ample pretence: the leading
      prelates were tempted by the liberality of his nocturnal visits;
      and the incorruptible patriarch was flattered by the homage of
      his new colleague, who led his mule by the bridle into the town,
      and removed to a respectful distance the importunity of the
      crowd. Without renouncing his title by royal descent, Palæologus
      encouraged a free discussion into the advantages of elective
      monarchy; and his adherents asked, with the insolence of triumph,
      what patient would trust his health, or what merchant would
      abandon his vessel, to the _hereditary_ skill of a physician or a
      pilot? The youth of the emperor, and the impending dangers of a
      minority, required the support of a mature and experienced
      guardian; of an associate raised above the envy of his equals,
      and invested with the name and prerogatives of royalty. For the
      interest of the prince and people, without any selfish views for
      himself or his family, the great duke consented to guard and
      instruct the son of Theodore; but he sighed for the happy moment
      when he might restore to his firmer hands the administration of
      his patrimony, and enjoy the blessings of a private station. He
      was first invested with the title and prerogatives of _despot_,
      which bestowed the purple ornaments and the second place in the
      Roman monarchy. It was afterwards agreed that John and Michael
      should be proclaimed as joint emperors, and raised on the
      buckler, but that the preeminence should be reserved for the
      birthright of the former. A mutual league of amity was pledged
      between the royal partners; and in case of a rupture, the
      subjects were bound, by their oath of allegiance, to declare
      themselves against the aggressor; an ambiguous name, the seed of
      discord and civil war. Palæologus was content; but, on the day of
      the coronation, and in the cathedral of Nice, his zealous
      adherents most vehemently urged the just priority of his age and
      merit. The unseasonable dispute was eluded by postponing to a
      more convenient opportunity the coronation of John Lascaris; and
      he walked with a slight diadem in the train of his guardian, who
      alone received the Imperial crown from the hands of the
      patriarch. It was not without extreme reluctance that Arsenius
      abandoned the cause of his pupil; out the Varangians brandished
      their battle-axes; a sign of assent was extorted from the
      trembling youth; and some voices were heard, that the life of a
      child should no longer impede the settlement of the nation. A
      full harvest of honors and employments was distributed among his
      friends by the grateful Palæologus. In his own family he created
      a despot and two sebastocrators; Alexius Strategopulus was
      decorated with the title of Cæsar; and that veteran commander
      soon repaid the obligation, by restoring Constantinople to the
      Greek emperor.

      14 (return) [ Without comparing Pachymer to Thucydides or
      Tacitus, I will praise his narrative, (l. i. c. 13—32, l. ii. c.
      1—9,) which pursues the ascent of Palæologus with eloquence,
      perspicuity, and tolerable freedom. Acropolita is more cautious,
      and Gregoras more concise.]

      15 (return) [ The judicial combat was abolished by St. Louis in
      his own territories; and his example and authority were at length
      prevalent in France, (Esprit des Loix, l. xxviii. c. 29.)]

      16 (return) [ In civil cases Henry II. gave an option to the
      defendant: Glanville prefers the proof by evidence; and that by
      judicial combat is reprobated in the Fleta. Yet the trial by
      battle has never been abrogated in the English law, and it was
      ordered by the judges as late as the beginning of the last
      century. * Note : And even demanded in the present.—M.]

      17 (return) [ Yet an ingenious friend has urged to me in
      mitigation of this practice, 1. _That_ in nations emerging from
      barbarism, it moderates the license of private war and arbitrary
      revenge. 2. _That_ it is less absurd than the trials by the
      ordeal, or boiling water, or the cross, which it has contributed
      to abolish. 3. _That_ it served at least as a test of personal
      courage; a quality so seldom united with a base disposition, that
      the danger of a trial might be some check to a malicious
      prosecutor, and a useful barrier against injustice supported by
      power. The gallant and unfortunate earl of Surrey might probably
      have escaped his unmerited fate, had not his demand of the combat
      against his accuser been overruled.]

      It was in the second year of his reign, while he resided in the
      palace and gardens of Nymphæum, 18 near Smyrna, that the first
      messenger arrived at the dead of night; and the stupendous
      intelligence was imparted to Michael, after he had been gently
      waked by the tender precaution of his sister Eulogia. The man was
      unknown or obscure; he produced no letters from the victorious
      Cæsar; nor could it easily be credited, after the defeat of
      Vataces and the recent failure of Palæologus himself, that the
      capital had been surprised by a detachment of eight hundred
      soldiers. As a hostage, the doubtful author was confined, with
      the assurance of death or an ample recompense; and the court was
      left some hours in the anxiety of hope and fear, till the
      messengers of Alexius arrived with the authentic intelligence,
      and displayed the trophies of the conquest, the sword and
      sceptre, 19 the buskins and bonnet, 20 of the usurper Baldwin,
      which he had dropped in his precipitate flight. A general
      assembly of the bishops, senators, and nobles, was immediately
      convened, and never perhaps was an event received with more
      heartfelt and universal joy. In a studied oration, the new
      sovereign of Constantinople congratulated his own and the public
      fortune. “There was a time,” said he, “a far distant time, when
      the Roman empire extended to the Adriatic, the Tigris, and the
      confines of Æthiopia. After the loss of the provinces, our
      capital itself, in these last and calamitous days, has been
      wrested from our hands by the Barbarians of the West. From the
      lowest ebb, the tide of prosperity has again returned in our
      favor; but our prosperity was that of fugitives and exiles: and
      when we were asked, which was the country of the Romans, we
      indicated with a blush the climate of the globe, and the quarter
      of the heavens. The divine Providence has now restored to our
      arms the city of Constantine, the sacred seat of religion and
      empire; and it will depend on our valor and conduct to render
      this important acquisition the pledge and omen of future
      victories.” So eager was the impatience of the prince and people,
      that Michael made his triumphal entry into Constantinople only
      twenty days after the expulsion of the Latins. The golden gate
      was thrown open at his approach; the devout conqueror dismounted
      from his horse; and a miraculous image of Mary the Conductress
      was borne before him, that the divine Virgin in person might
      appear to conduct him to the temple of her Son, the cathedral of
      St. Sophia. But after the first transport of devotion and pride,
      he sighed at the dreary prospect of solitude and ruin. The palace
      was defiled with smoke and dirt, and the gross intemperance of
      the Franks; whole streets had been consumed by fire, or were
      decayed by the injuries of time; the sacred and profane edifices
      were stripped of their ornaments: and, as if they were conscious
      of their approaching exile, the industry of the Latins had been
      confined to the work of pillage and destruction. Trade had
      expired under the pressure of anarchy and distress, and the
      numbers of inhabitants had decreased with the opulence of the
      city. It was the first care of the Greek monarch to reinstate the
      nobles in the palaces of their fathers; and the houses or the
      ground which they occupied were restored to the families that
      could exhibit a legal right of inheritance. But the far greater
      part was extinct or lost; the vacant property had devolved to the
      lord; he repeopled Constantinople by a liberal invitation to the
      provinces; and the brave _volunteers_ were seated in the capital
      which had been recovered by their arms. The French barons and the
      principal families had retired with their emperor; but the
      patient and humble crowd of Latins was attached to the country,
      and indifferent to the change of masters. Instead of banishing
      the factories of the Pisans, Venetians, and Genoese, the prudent
      conqueror accepted their oaths of allegiance, encouraged their
      industry, confirmed their privileges, and allowed them to live
      under the jurisdiction of their proper magistrates. Of these
      nations, the Pisans and Venetians preserved their respective
      quarters in the city; but the services and power of the Genoese
      deserved at the same time the gratitude and the jealousy of the
      Greeks. Their independent colony was first planted at the seaport
      town of Heraclea in Thrace. They were speedily recalled, and
      settled in the exclusive possession of the suburb of Galata, an
      advantageous post, in which they revived the commerce, and
      insulted the majesty, of the Byzantine empire. 21

      The recovery of Constantinople was celebrated as the æra of a new
      empire: the conqueror, alone, and by the right of the sword,
      renewed his coronation in the church of St. Sophia; and the name
      and honors of John Lascaris, his pupil and lawful sovereign, were
      insensibly abolished. But his claims still lived in the minds of
      the people; and the royal youth must speedily attain the years of
      manhood and ambition. By fear or conscience, Palæologus was
      restrained from dipping his hands in innocent and royal blood;
      but the anxiety of a usurper and a parent urged him to secure his
      throne by one of those imperfect crimes so familiar to the modern
      Greeks. The loss of sight incapacitated the young prince for the
      active business of the world; instead of the brutal violence of
      tearing out his eyes, the visual nerve was destroyed by the
      intense glare of a red-hot basin, 22 and John Lascaris was
      removed to a distant castle, where he spent many years in privacy
      and oblivion. Such cool and deliberate guilt may seem
      incompatible with remorse; but if Michael could trust the mercy
      of Heaven, he was not inaccessible to the reproaches and
      vengeance of mankind, which he had provoked by cruelty and
      treason. His cruelty imposed on a servile court the duties of
      applause or silence; but the clergy had a right to speak in the
      name of their invisible Master; and their holy legions were led
      by a prelate, whose character was above the temptations of hope
      or fear. After a short abdication of his dignity, Arsenius 23 had
      consented to ascend the ecclesiastical throne of Constantinople,
      and to preside in the restoration of the church. His pious
      simplicity was long deceived by the arts of Palæologus; and his
      patience and submission might soothe the usurper, and protect the
      safety of the young prince. On the news of his inhuman treatment,
      the patriarch unsheathed the spiritual sword; and superstition,
      on this occasion, was enlisted in the cause of humanity and
      justice. In a synod of bishops, who were stimulated by the
      example of his zeal, the patriarch pronounced a sentence of
      excommunication; though his prudence still repeated the name of
      Michael in the public prayers. The Eastern prelates had not
      adopted the dangerous maxims of ancient Rome; nor did they
      presume to enforce their censures, by deposing princes, or
      absolving nations from their oaths of allegiance. But the
      Christian, who had been separated from God and the church, became
      an object of horror; and, in a turbulent and fanatic capital,
      that horror might arm the hand of an assassin, or inflame a
      sedition of the people. Palæologus felt his danger, confessed his
      guilt, and deprecated his judge: the act was irretrievable; the
      prize was obtained; and the most rigorous penance, which he
      solicited, would have raised the sinner to the reputation of a
      saint. The unrelenting patriarch refused to announce any means of
      atonement or any hopes of mercy; and condescended only to
      pronounce, that for so great a crime, great indeed must be the
      satisfaction. “Do you require,” said Michael, “that I should
      abdicate the empire?” and at these words, he offered, or seemed
      to offer, the sword of state. Arsenius eagerly grasped this
      pledge of sovereignty; but when he perceived that the emperor was
      unwilling to purchase absolution at so dear a rate, he
      indignantly escaped to his cell, and left the royal sinner
      kneeling and weeping before the door. 24

      22 (return) [ This milder invention for extinguishing the sight
      was tried by the philosopher Democritus on himself, when he
      sought to withdraw his mind from the visible world: a foolish
      story! The word _abacinare_, in Latin and Italian, has furnished
      Ducange (Gloss. Lat.) with an opportunity to review the various
      modes of blinding: the more violent were scooping, burning with
      an iron, or hot vinegar, and binding the head with a strong cord
      till the eyes burst from their sockets. Ingenious tyrants!]

      the ajeleia and raqumia of Arsenius the virtues of a hermit, the
      vices of a minister, (l. xii. c. 2.)]

      told by Pachymer (l. iii. c. 10, 14, 19, &c.) and Gregoras, (l.

      Chapter LXII: Greek Emperors Of Nice And Constantinople.—Part II.

      The danger and scandal of this excommunication subsisted above
      three years, till the popular clamor was assuaged by time and
      repentance; till the brethren of Arsenius condemned his
      inflexible spirit, so repugnant to the unbounded forgiveness of
      the gospel. The emperor had artfully insinuated, that, if he were
      still rejected at home, he might seek, in the Roman pontiff, a
      more indulgent judge; but it was far more easy and effectual to
      find or to place that judge at the head of the Byzantine church.
      Arsenius was involved in a vague rumor of conspiracy and
      disaffection; 248 some irregular steps in his ordination and
      government were liable to censure; a synod deposed him from the
      episcopal office; and he was transported under a guard of
      soldiers to a small island of the Propontis. Before his exile, he
      sullenly requested that a strict account might be taken of the
      treasures of the church; boasted, that his sole riches, three
      pieces of gold, had been earned by transcribing the psalms;
      continued to assert the freedom of his mind; and denied, with his
      last breath, the pardon which was implored by the royal sinner.
      25 After some delay, Gregory, 259 bishop of Adrianople, was
      translated to the Byzantine throne; but his authority was found
      insufficient to support the absolution of the emperor; and
      Joseph, a reverend monk, was substituted to that important
      function. This edifying scene was represented in the presence of
      the senate and the people; at the end of six years the humble
      penitent was restored to the communion of the faithful; and
      humanity will rejoice, that a milder treatment of the captive
      Lascaris was stipulated as a proof of his remorse. But the spirit
      of Arsenius still survived in a powerful faction of the monks and
      clergy, who persevered about forty-eight years in an obstinate
      schism. Their scruples were treated with tenderness and respect
      by Michael and his son; and the reconciliation of the Arsenites
      was the serious labor of the church and state. In the confidence
      of fanaticism, they had proposed to try their cause by a miracle;
      and when the two papers, that contained their own and the adverse
      cause, were cast into a fiery brazier, they expected that the
      Catholic verity would be respected by the flames. Alas! the two
      papers were indiscriminately consumed, and this unforeseen
      accident produced the union of a day, and renewed the quarrel of
      an age. 26 The final treaty displayed the victory of the
      Arsenites: the clergy abstained during forty days from all
      ecclesiastical functions; a slight penance was imposed on the
      laity; the body of Arsenius was deposited in the sanctuary; and,
      in the name of the departed saint, the prince and people were
      released from the sins of their fathers. 27

      248 (return) [ Except the omission of a prayer for the emperor,
      the charges against Arsenius were of different nature: he was
      accused of having allowed the sultan of Iconium to bathe in
      vessels signed with the cross, and to have admitted him to the
      church, though unbaptized, during the service. It was pleaded, in
      favor of Arsenius, among other proofs of the sultan’s
      Christianity, that he had offered to eat ham. Pachymer, l. iv. c.
      4, p. 265. It was after his exile that he was involved in a
      charge of conspiracy.—M.]

      25 (return) [ Pachymer relates the exile of Arsenius, (l. iv. c.
      1—16:) he was one of the commissaries who visited him in the
      desert island. The last testament of the unforgiving patriarch is
      still extant, (Dupin, Bibliothèque Ecclésiastique, tom. x. p.
      95.)]

      259 (return) [ Pachymer calls him Germanus.—M.]

      26 (return) [ Pachymer (l. vii. c. 22) relates this miraculous
      trial like a philosopher, and treats with similar contempt a plot
      of the Arsenites, to hide a revelation in the coffin of some old
      saint, (l. vii. c. 13.) He compensates this incredulity by an
      image that weeps, another that bleeds, (l. vii. c. 30,) and the
      miraculous cures of a deaf and a mute patient, (l. xi. c. 32.)]

      27 (return) [ The story of the Arsenites is spread through the
      thirteen books of Pachymer. Their union and triumph are reserved
      for Nicephorus Gregoras, (l. vii. c. 9,) who neither loves nor
      esteems these sectaries.]

      The establishment of his family was the motive, or at least the
      pretence, of the crime of Palæologus; and he was impatient to
      confirm the succession, by sharing with his eldest son the honors
      of the purple. Andronicus, afterwards surnamed the Elder, was
      proclaimed and crowned emperor of the Romans, in the fifteenth
      year of his age; and, from the first æra of a prolix and
      inglorious reign, he held that august title nine years as the
      colleague, and fifty as the successor, of his father. Michael
      himself, had he died in a private station, would have been
      thought more worthy of the empire; and the assaults of his
      temporal and spiritual enemies left him few moments to labor for
      his own fame or the happiness of his subjects. He wrested from
      the Franks several of the noblest islands of the Archipelago,
      Lesbos, Chios, and Rhodes: his brother Constantine was sent to
      command in Malvasia and Sparta; and the eastern side of the
      Morea, from Argos and Napoli to Cape Thinners, was repossessed by
      the Greeks. This effusion of Christian blood was loudly condemned
      by the patriarch; and the insolent priest presumed to interpose
      his fears and scruples between the arms of princes. But in the
      prosecution of these western conquests, the countries beyond the
      Hellespont were left naked to the Turks; and their depredations
      verified the prophecy of a dying senator, that the recovery of
      Constantinople would be the ruin of Asia. The victories of
      Michael were achieved by his lieutenants; his sword rusted in the
      palace; and, in the transactions of the emperor with the popes
      and the king of Naples, his political acts were stained with
      cruelty and fraud. 28

      28 (return) [ Of the xiii books of Pachymer, the first six (as
      the ivth and vth of Nicephorus Gregoras) contain the reign of
      Michael, at the time of whose death he was forty years of age.

      history into two parts, I follow Ducange and Cousin, who number
      the xiii. books in one series.]

      I. The Vatican was the most natural refuge of a Latin emperor,
      who had been driven from his throne; and Pope Urban the Fourth
      appeared to pity the misfortunes, and vindicate the cause, of the
      fugitive Baldwin. A crusade, with plenary indulgence, was
      preached by his command against the schismatic Greeks: he
      excommunicated their allies and adherents; solicited Louis the
      Ninth in favor of his kinsman; and demanded a tenth of the
      ecclesiastical revenues of France and England for the service of
      the holy war. 29 The subtle Greek, who watched the rising tempest
      of the West, attempted to suspend or soothe the hostility of the
      pope, by suppliant embassies and respectful letters; but he
      insinuated that the establishment of peace must prepare the
      reconciliation and obedience of the Eastern church. The Roman
      court could not be deceived by so gross an artifice; and Michael
      was admonished, that the repentance of the son should precede the
      forgiveness of the father; and that _faith_ (an ambiguous word)
      was the only basis of friendship and alliance. After a long and
      affected delay, the approach of danger, and the importunity of
      Gregory the Tenth, compelled him to enter on a more serious
      negotiation: he alleged the example of the great Vataces; and the
      Greek clergy, who understood the intentions of their prince, were
      not alarmed by the first steps of reconciliation and respect. But
      when he pressed the conclusion of the treaty, they strenuously
      declared, that the Latins, though not in name, were heretics in
      fact, and that they despised those strangers as the vilest and
      most despicable portion of the human race. 30 It was the task of
      the emperor to persuade, to corrupt, to intimidate the most
      popular ecclesiastics, to gain the vote of each individual, and
      alternately to urge the arguments of Christian charity and the
      public welfare. The texts of the fathers and the arms of the
      Franks were balanced in the theological and political scale; and
      without approving the addition to the Nicene creed, the most
      moderate were taught to confess, that the two hostile
      propositions of proceeding from the Father by the Son, and of
      proceeding from the Father and the Son, might be reduced to a
      safe and Catholic sense. 31 The supremacy of the pope was a
      doctrine more easy to conceive, but more painful to acknowledge:
      yet Michael represented to his monks and prelates, that they
      might submit to name the Roman bishop as the first of the
      patriarchs; and that their distance and discretion would guard
      the liberties of the Eastern church from the mischievous
      consequences of the right of appeal. He protested that he would
      sacrifice his life and empire rather than yield the smallest
      point of orthodox faith or national independence; and this
      declaration was sealed and ratified by a golden bull. The
      patriarch Joseph withdrew to a monastery, to resign or resume his
      throne, according to the event of the treaty: the letters of
      union and obedience were subscribed by the emperor, his son
      Andronicus, and thirty-five archbishops and metropolitans, with
      their respective synods; and the episcopal list was multiplied by
      many dioceses which were annihilated under the yoke of the
      infidels. An embassy was composed of some trusty ministers and
      prelates: they embarked for Italy, with rich ornaments and rare
      perfumes for the altar of St. Peter; and their secret orders
      authorized and recommended a boundless compliance. They were
      received in the general council of Lyons, by Pope Gregory the
      Tenth, at the head of five hundred bishops. 32 He embraced with
      tears his long-lost and repentant children; accepted the oath of
      the ambassadors, who abjured the schism in the name of the two
      emperors; adorned the prelates with the ring and mitre; chanted
      in Greek and Latin the Nicene creed with the addition of
      _filioque_; and rejoiced in the union of the East and West, which
      had been reserved for his reign. To consummate this pious work,
      the Byzantine deputies were speedily followed by the pope’s
      nuncios; and their instruction discloses the policy of the
      Vatican, which could not be satisfied with the vain title of
      supremacy. After viewing the temper of the prince and people,
      they were enjoined to absolve the schismatic clergy, who should
      subscribe and swear their abjuration and obedience; to establish
      in all the churches the use of the perfect creed; to prepare the
      entrance of a cardinal legate, with the full powers and dignity
      of his office; and to instruct the emperor in the advantages
      which he might derive from the temporal protection of the Roman
      pontiff. 33

      Venetians and Genoese, they branded the Latins as kaphloi and

      But they found a country without a friend, a nation in which the
      names of Rome and Union were pronounced with abhorrence. The
      patriarch Joseph was indeed removed: his place was filled by
      Veccus, an ecclesiastic of learning and moderation; and the
      emperor was still urged by the same motives, to persevere in the
      same professions. But in his private language Palæologus affected
      to deplore the pride, and to blame the innovations, of the
      Latins; and while he debased his character by this double
      hypocrisy, he justified and punished the opposition of his
      subjects. By the joint suffrage of the new and the ancient Rome,
      a sentence of excommunication was pronounced against the
      obstinate schismatics; the censures of the church were executed
      by the sword of Michael; on the failure of persuasion, he tried
      the arguments of prison and exile, of whipping and mutilation;
      those touchstones, says an historian, of cowards and the brave.
      Two Greeks still reigned in Ætolia, Epirus, and Thessaly, with
      the appellation of despots: they had yielded to the sovereign of
      Constantinople, but they rejected the chains of the Roman
      pontiff, and supported their refusal by successful arms. Under
      their protection, the fugitive monks and bishops assembled in
      hostile synods; and retorted the name of heretic with the galling
      addition of apostate: the prince of Trebizond was tempted to
      assume the forfeit title of emperor; 339 and even the Latins of
      Negropont, Thebes, Athens, and the Morea, forgot the merits of
      the convert, to join, with open or clandestine aid, the enemies
      of Palæologus. His favorite generals, of his own blood, and
      family, successively deserted, or betrayed, the sacrilegious
      trust. His sister Eulogia, a niece, and two female cousins,
      conspired against him; another niece, Mary queen of Bulgaria,
      negotiated his ruin with the sultan of Egypt; and, in the public
      eye, their treason was consecrated as the most sublime virtue. 34
      To the pope’s nuncios, who urged the consummation of the work,
      Palæologus exposed a naked recital of all that he had done and
      suffered for their sake. They were assured that the guilty
      sectaries, of both sexes and every rank, had been deprived of
      their honors, their fortunes, and their liberty; a spreading list
      of confiscation and punishment, which involved many persons, the
      dearest to the emperor, or the best deserving of his favor. They
      were conducted to the prison, to behold four princes of the royal
      blood chained in the four corners, and shaking their fetters in
      an agony of grief and rage. Two of these captives were afterwards
      released; the one by submission, the other by death: but the
      obstinacy of their two companions was chastised by the loss of
      their eyes; and the Greeks, the least adverse to the union,
      deplored that cruel and inauspicious tragedy. 35 Persecutors must
      expect the hatred of those whom they oppress; but they commonly
      find some consolation in the testimony of their conscience, the
      applause of their party, and, perhaps, the success of their
      undertaking. But the hypocrisy of Michael, which was prompted
      only by political motives, must have forced him to hate himself,
      to despise his followers, and to esteem and envy the rebel
      champions by whom he was detested and despised. While his
      violence was abhorred at Constantinople, at Rome his slowness was
      arraigned, and his sincerity suspected; till at length Pope
      Martin the Fourth excluded the Greek emperor from the pale of a
      church, into which he was striving to reduce a schismatic people.
      No sooner had the tyrant expired, than the union was dissolved,
      and abjured by unanimous consent; the churches were purified; the
      penitents were reconciled; and his son Andronicus, after weeping
      the sins and errors of his youth most piously denied his father
      the burial of a prince and a Christian. 36

      36 (return) [ Pachymer, l. vii. c. 1—ii. 17. The speech of
      Andronicus the Elder (lib. xii. c. 2) is a curious record, which
      proves that if the Greeks were the slaves of the emperor, the
      emperor was not less the slave of superstition and the clergy.]

      II. In the distress of the Latins, the walls and towers of
      Constantinople had fallen to decay: they were restored and
      fortified by the policy of Michael, who deposited a plenteous
      store of corn and salt provisions, to sustain the siege which he
      might hourly expect from the resentment of the Western powers. Of
      these, the sovereign of the Two Sicilies was the most formidable
      neighbor: but as long as they were possessed by Mainfroy, the
      bastard of Frederic the Second, his monarchy was the bulwark,
      rather than the annoyance, of the Eastern empire. The usurper,
      though a brave and active prince, was sufficiently employed in
      the defence of his throne: his proscription by successive popes
      had separated Mainfroy from the common cause of the Latins; and
      the forces that might have besieged Constantinople were detained
      in a crusade against the domestic enemy of Rome. The prize of her
      avenger, the crown of the Two Sicilies, was won and worn by the
      brother of St Louis, by Charles count of Anjou and Provence, who
      led the chivalry of France on this holy expedition. 37 The
      disaffection of his Christian subjects compelled Mainfroy to
      enlist a colony of Saracens whom his father had planted in
      Apulia; and this odious succor will explain the defiance of the
      Catholic hero, who rejected all terms of accommodation. “Bear
      this message,” said Charles, “to the sultan of Nocera, that God
      and the sword are umpire between us; and that he shall either
      send me to paradise, or I will send him to the pit of hell.” The
      armies met: and though I am ignorant of Mainfroy’s doom in the
      other world, in this he lost his friends, his kingdom, and his
      life, in the bloody battle of Benevento. Naples and Sicily were
      immediately peopled with a warlike race of French nobles; and
      their aspiring leader embraced the future conquest of Africa,
      Greece, and Palestine. The most specious reasons might point his
      first arms against the Byzantine empire; and Palæologus,
      diffident of his own strength, repeatedly appealed from the
      ambition of Charles to the humanity of St. Louis, who still
      preserved a just ascendant over the mind of his ferocious
      brother. For a while the attention of that brother was confined
      at home by the invasion of Conradin, the last heir to the
      imperial house of Swabia; but the hapless boy sunk in the unequal
      conflict; and his execution on a public scaffold taught the
      rivals of Charles to tremble for their heads as well as their
      dominions. A second respite was obtained by the last crusade of
      St. Louis to the African coast; and the double motive of interest
      and duty urged the king of Naples to assist, with his powers and
      his presence, the holy enterprise. The death of St. Louis
      released him from the importunity of a virtuous censor: the king
      of Tunis confessed himself the tributary and vassal of the crown
      of Sicily; and the boldest of the French knights were free to
      enlist under his banner against the Greek empire. A treaty and a
      marriage united his interest with the house of Courtenay; his
      daughter Beatrice was promised to Philip, son and heir of the
      emperor Baldwin; a pension of six hundred ounces of gold was
      allowed for his maintenance; and his generous father distributed
      among his aliens the kingdoms and provinces of the East,
      reserving only Constantinople, and one day’s journey round the
      city for the imperial domain. 38 In this perilous moment,
      Palæologus was the most eager to subscribe the creed, and implore
      the protection, of the Roman pontiff, who assumed, with propriety
      and weight, the character of an angel of peace, the common father
      of the Christians. By his voice, the sword of Charles was chained
      in the scabbard; and the Greek ambassadors beheld him, in the
      pope’s antechamber, biting his ivory sceptre in a transport of
      fury, and deeply resenting the refusal to enfranchise and
      consecrate his arms. He appears to have respected the
      disinterested mediation of Gregory the Tenth; but Charles was
      insensibly disgusted by the pride and partiality of Nicholas the
      Third; and his attachment to his kindred, the Ursini family,
      alienated the most strenuous champion from the service of the
      church. The hostile league against the Greeks, of Philip the
      Latin emperor, the king of the Two Sicilies, and the republic of
      Venice, was ripened into execution; and the election of Martin
      the Fourth, a French pope, gave a sanction to the cause. Of the
      allies, Philip supplied his name; Martin, a bull of
      excommunication; the Venetians, a squadron of forty galleys; and
      the formidable powers of Charles consisted of forty counts, ten
      thousand men at arms, a numerous body of infantry, and a fleet of
      more than three hundred ships and transports. A distant day was
      appointed for assembling this mighty force in the harbor of
      Brindisi; and a previous attempt was risked with a detachment of
      three hundred knights, who invaded Albania, and besieged the
      fortress of Belgrade. Their defeat might amuse with a triumph the
      vanity of Constantinople; but the more sagacious Michael,
      despairing of his arms, depended on the effects of a conspiracy;
      on the secret workings of a rat, who gnawed the bowstring 39 of
      the Sicilian tyrant.

      Among the proscribed adherents of the house of Swabia, John of
      Procida forfeited a small island of that name in the Bay of
      Naples. His birth was noble, but his education was learned; and
      in the poverty of exile, he was relieved by the practice of
      physic, which he had studied in the school of Salerno. Fortune
      had left him nothing to lose, except life; and to despise life is
      the first qualification of a rebel. Procida was endowed with the
      art of negotiation, to enforce his reasons and disguise his
      motives; and in his various transactions with nations and men, he
      could persuade each party that he labored solely for _their_
      interest. The new kingdoms of Charles were afflicted by every
      species of fiscal and military oppression; 40 and the lives and
      fortunes of his Italian subjects were sacrificed to the greatness
      of their master and the licentiousness of his followers. The
      hatred of Naples was repressed by his presence; but the looser
      government of his vicegerents excited the contempt, as well as
      the aversion, of the Sicilians: the island was roused to a sense
      of freedom by the eloquence of Procida; and he displayed to every
      baron his private interest in the common cause. In the confidence
      of foreign aid, he successively visited the courts of the Greek
      emperor, and of Peter king of Arragon, 41 who possessed the
      maritime countries of Valentia and Catalonia. To the ambitious
      Peter a crown was presented, which he might justly claim by his
      marriage with the sister 419 of Mainfroy, and by the dying voice
      of Conradin, who from the scaffold had cast a ring to his heir
      and avenger. Palæologus was easily persuaded to divert his enemy
      from a foreign war by a rebellion at home; and a Greek subsidy of
      twenty-five thousand ounces of gold was most profitably applied
      to arm a Catalan fleet, which sailed under a holy banner to the
      specious attack of the Saracens of Africa. In the disguise of a
      monk or beggar, the indefatigable missionary of revolt flew from
      Constantinople to Rome, and from Sicily to Saragossa: the treaty
      was sealed with the signet of Pope Nicholas himself, the enemy of
      Charles; and his deed of gift transferred the fiefs of St. Peter
      from the house of Anjou to that of Arragon. So widely diffused
      and so freely circulated, the secret was preserved above two
      years with impenetrable discretion; and each of the conspirators
      imbibed the maxim of Peter, who declared that he would cut off
      his left hand if it were conscious of the intentions of his
      right. The mine was prepared with deep and dangerous artifice;
      but it may be questioned, whether the instant explosion of
      Palermo were the effect of accident or design.

      On the vigil of Easter, a procession of the disarmed citizens
      visited a church without the walls; and a noble damsel was rudely
      insulted by a French soldier. 42 The ravisher was instantly
      punished with death; and if the people was at first scattered by
      a military force, their numbers and fury prevailed: the
      conspirators seized the opportunity; the flame spread over the
      island; and eight thousand French were exterminated in a
      promiscuous massacre, which has obtained the name of the Sicilian
      Vespers. 43 From every city the banners of freedom and the church
      were displayed: the revolt was inspired by the presence or the
      soul of Procida and Peter of Arragon, who sailed from the African
      coast to Palermo, was saluted as the king and savior of the isle.
      By the rebellion of a people on whom he had so long trampled with
      impunity, Charles was astonished and confounded; and in the first
      agony of grief and devotion, he was heard to exclaim, “O God! if
      thou hast decreed to humble me, grant me at least a gentle and
      gradual descent from the pinnacle of greatness!” His fleet and
      army, which already filled the seaports of Italy, were hastily
      recalled from the service of the Grecian war; and the situation
      of Messina exposed that town to the first storm of his revenge.
      Feeble in themselves, and yet hopeless of foreign succor, the
      citizens would have repented, and submitted on the assurance of
      full pardon and their ancient privileges. But the pride of the
      monarch was already rekindled; and the most fervent entreaties of
      the legate could extort no more than a promise, that he would
      forgive the remainder, after a chosen list of eight hundred
      rebels had been yielded to his discretion. The despair of the
      Messinese renewed their courage: Peter of Arragon approached to
      their relief; 44 and his rival was driven back by the failure of
      provision and the terrors of the equinox to the Calabrian shore.
      At the same moment, the Catalan admiral, the famous Roger de
      Loria, swept the channel with an invincible squadron: the French
      fleet, more numerous in transports than in galleys, was either
      burnt or destroyed; and the same blow assured the independence of
      Sicily and the safety of the Greek empire. A few days before his
      death, the emperor Michael rejoiced in the fall of an enemy whom
      he hated and esteemed; and perhaps he might be content with the
      popular judgment, that had they not been matched with each other,
      Constantinople and Italy must speedily have obeyed the same
      master. 45 From this disastrous moment, the life of Charles was a
      series of misfortunes: his capital was insulted, his son was made
      prisoner, and he sunk into the grave without recovering the Isle
      of Sicily, which, after a war of twenty years, was finally
      severed from the throne of Naples, and transferred, as an
      independent kingdom, to a younger branch of the house of Arragon.

      Chapter LXII: Greek Emperors Of Nice And Constantinople.—Part
      III.

      I shall not, I trust, be accused of superstition; but I must
      remark that, even in this world, the natural order of events will
      sometimes afford the strong appearances of moral retribution. The
      first Palæologus had saved his empire by involving the kingdoms
      of the West in rebellion and blood; and from these scenes of
      discord uprose a generation of iron men, who assaulted and
      endangered the empire of his son. In modern times our debts and
      taxes are the secret poison which still corrodes the bosom of
      peace: but in the weak and disorderly government of the middle
      ages, it was agitated by the present evil of the disbanded
      armies. Too idle to work, too proud to beg, the mercenaries were
      accustomed to a life of rapine: they could rob with more dignity
      and effect under a banner and a chief; and the sovereign, to whom
      their service was useless, and their presence importunate,
      endeavored to discharge the torrent on some neighboring
      countries. After the peace of Sicily, many thousands of Genoese,
      _Catalans_, 47 &c., who had fought, by sea and land, under the
      standard of Anjou or Arragon, were blended into one nation by the
      resemblance of their manners and interest. They heard that the
      Greek provinces of Asia were invaded by the Turks: they resolved
      to share the harvest of pay and plunder: and Frederic king of
      Sicily most liberally contributed the means of their departure.
      In a warfare of twenty years, a ship, or a camp, was become their
      country; arms were their sole profession and property; valor was
      the only virtue which they knew; their women had imbibed the
      fearless temper of their lovers and husbands: it was reported,
      that, with a stroke of their broadsword, the Catalans could
      cleave a horseman and a horse; and the report itself was a
      powerful weapon. Roger de Flor 477 was the most popular of their
      chiefs; and his personal merit overshadowed the dignity of his
      prouder rivals of Arragon. The offspring of a marriage between a
      German gentleman of the court of Frederic the Second and a damsel
      of Brindisi, Roger was successively a templar, an apostate, a
      pirate, and at length the richest and most powerful admiral of
      the Mediterranean. He sailed from Messina to Constantinople, with
      eighteen galleys, four great ships, and eight thousand
      adventurers; 478 and his previous treaty was faithfully
      accomplished by Andronicus the elder, who accepted with joy and
      terror this formidable succor. A palace was allotted for his
      reception, and a niece of the emperor was given in marriage to
      the valiant stranger, who was immediately created great duke or
      admiral of Romania. After a decent repose, he transported his
      troops over the Propontis, and boldly led them against the Turks:
      in two bloody battles thirty thousand of the Moslems were slain:
      he raised the siege of Philadelphia, and deserved the name of the
      deliverer of Asia. But after a short season of prosperity, the
      cloud of slavery and ruin again burst on that unhappy province.
      The inhabitants escaped (says a Greek historian) from the smoke
      into the flames; and the hostility of the Turks was less
      pernicious than the friendship of the Catalans. 479 The lives and
      fortunes which they had rescued they considered as their own: the
      willing or reluctant maid was saved from the race of circumcision
      for the embraces of a Christian soldier: the exaction of fines
      and supplies was enforced by licentious rapine and arbitrary
      executions; and, on the resistance of Magnesia, the great duke
      besieged a city of the Roman empire. 48 These disorders he
      excused by the wrongs and passions of a victorious army; nor
      would his own authority or person have been safe, had he dared to
      punish his faithful followers, who were defrauded of the just and
      covenanted price of their services. The threats and complaints of
      Andronicus disclosed the nakedness of the empire. His golden bull
      had invited no more than five hundred horse and a thousand foot
      soldiers; yet the crowds of volunteers, who migrated to the East,
      had been enlisted and fed by his spontaneous bounty. While his
      bravest allies were content with three byzants or pieces of gold,
      for their monthly pay, an ounce, or even two ounces, of gold were
      assigned to the Catalans, whose annual pension would thus amount
      to near a hundred pounds sterling: one of their chiefs had
      modestly rated at three hundred thousand crowns the value of his
      _future_ merits; and above a million had been issued from the
      treasury for the maintenance of these costly mercenaries. A cruel
      tax had been imposed on the corn of the husbandman: one third was
      retrenched from the salaries of the public officers; and the
      standard of the coin was so shamefully debased, that of the
      four-and-twenty parts only five were of pure gold. 49 At the
      summons of the emperor, Roger evacuated a province which no
      longer supplied the materials of rapine; 496 but he refused to
      disperse his troops; and while his style was respectful, his
      conduct was independent and hostile. He protested, that if the
      emperor should march against him, he would advance forty paces to
      kiss the ground before him; but in rising from this prostrate
      attitude Roger had a life and sword at the service of his
      friends. The great duke of Romania condescended to accept the
      title and ornaments of Cæsar; but he rejected the new proposal of
      the government of Asia with a subsidy of corn and money, 497 on
      condition that he should reduce his troops to the harmless number
      of three thousand men. Assassination is the last resource of
      cowards. The Cæsar was tempted to visit the royal residence of
      Adrianople; in the apartment, and before the eyes, of the empress
      he was stabbed by the Alani guards; and though the deed was
      imputed to their private revenge, 498 his countrymen, who dwelt
      at Constantinople in the security of peace, were involved in the
      same proscription by the prince or people. The loss of their
      leader intimidated the crowd of adventurers, who hoisted the
      sails of flight, and were soon scattered round the coasts of the
      Mediterranean. But a veteran band of fifteen hundred Catalans, or
      French, stood firm in the strong fortress of Gallipoli on the
      Hellespont, displayed the banners of Arragon, and offered to
      revenge and justify their chief, by an equal combat of ten or a
      hundred warriors. Instead of accepting this bold defiance, the
      emperor Michael, the son and colleague of Andronicus, resolved to
      oppress them with the weight of multitudes: every nerve was
      strained to form an army of thirteen thousand horse and thirty
      thousand foot; and the Propontis was covered with the ships of
      the Greeks and Genoese. In two battles by sea and land, these
      mighty forces were encountered and overthrown by the despair and
      discipline of the Catalans: the young emperor fled to the palace;
      and an insufficient guard of light-horse was left for the
      protection of the open country. Victory renewed the hopes and
      numbers of the adventures: every nation was blended under the
      name and standard of the _great company_; and three thousand
      Turkish proselytes deserted from the Imperial service to join
      this military association. In the possession of Gallipoli, 509
      the Catalans intercepted the trade of Constantinople and the
      Black Sea, while they spread their devastation on either side of
      the Hellespont over the confines of Europe and Asia. To prevent
      their approach, the greatest part of the Byzantine territory was
      laid waste by the Greeks themselves: the peasants and their
      cattle retired into the city; and myriads of sheep and oxen, for
      which neither place nor food could be procured, were unprofitably
      slaughtered on the same day. Four times the emperor Andronicus
      sued for peace, and four times he was inflexibly repulsed, till
      the want of provisions, and the discord of the chiefs, compelled
      the Catalans to evacuate the banks of the Hellespont and the
      neighborhood of the capital. After their separation from the
      Turks, the remains of the great company pursued their march
      through Macedonia and Thessaly, to seek a new establishment in
      the heart of Greece. 50

      47 (return) [ In this motley multitude, the Catalans and
      Spaniards, the bravest of the soldiery, were styled by themselves
      and the Greeks _Amogavares_. Moncada derives their origin from

      spite of national and religious pride, I am afraid the latter is
      in the right.]

      historical fragment, detailed and interesting, entitled “The
      Spaniards of the Fourteenth Century,” and inserted in “L’Espagne
      en 1808,” a work translated from the German, vol. ii. p. 167.
      This narrative enables us to detect some slight errors which have
      crept into that of Gibbon.—G.]

      478 (return) [ The troops of Roger de Flor, according to his
      companions Ramon de Montaner, were 1500 men at arms, 4000
      Almogavares, and 1040 other foot, besides the sailors and
      mariners, vol. ii. p. 137.—M.]

      479 (return) [ Ramon de Montaner suppresses the cruelties and
      oppressions of the Catalans, in which, perhaps, he shared.—M.]

      48 (return) [ Some idea may be formed of the population of these
      cities, from the 36,000 inhabitants of Tralles, which, in the
      preceding reign, was rebuilt by the emperor, and ruined by the
      Turks. (Pachymer, l. vi. c. 20, 21.)]

      49 (return) [ I have collected these pecuniary circumstances from
      Pachymer, (l. xi. c. 21, l. xii. c. 4, 5, 8, 14, 19,) who
      describes the progressive degradation of the gold coin. Even in
      the prosperous times of John Ducas Vataces, the byzants were
      composed in equal proportions of the pure and the baser metal.
      The poverty of Michael Palæologus compelled him to strike a new
      coin, with nine parts, or carats, of gold, and fifteen of copper
      alloy. After his death, the standard rose to ten carats, till in
      the public distress it was reduced to the moiety. The prince was
      relieved for a moment, while credit and commerce were forever
      blasted. In France, the gold coin is of twenty-two carats, (one
      twelfth alloy,) and the standard of England and Holland is still
      higher.]

      496 (return) [ Roger de Flor, according to Ramon de Montaner, was
      recalled from Natolia, on account of the war which had arisen on
      the death of Asan, king of Bulgaria. Andronicus claimed the
      kingdom for his nephew, the sons of Asan by his sister. Roger de
      Flor turned the tide of success in favor of the emperor of
      Constantinople and made peace.—M.]

      497 (return) [ Andronicus paid the Catalans in the debased money,
      much to their indignation.—M.]

      498 (return) [ According to Ramon de Montaner, he was murdered by
      order of Kyr (kurioV) Michael, son of the emperor. p. 170.—M.]

      509 (return) [ Ramon de Montaner describes his sojourn at
      Gallipoli: Nous etions si riches, que nous ne semions, ni ne
      labourions, ni ne faisions enver des vins ni ne cultivions les
      vignes: et cependant tous les ans nous recucillions tour ce qu’il
      nous fallait, en vin, froment et avoine. p. 193. This lasted for
      five merry years. Ramon de Montaner is high authority, for he was
      “chancelier et maitre rational de l’armée,” (commissary of
      _rations_.) He was left governor; all the scribes of the army
      remained with him, and with their aid he kept the books in which
      were registered the number of horse and foot employed on each
      expedition. According to this book the plunder was shared, of
      which he had a fifth for his trouble. p. 197.—M.]

      50 (return) [ The Catalan war is most copiously related by
      Pachymer, in the xith, xiith, and xiiith books, till he breaks
      off in the year 1308. Nicephorus Gregoras (l. vii. 3—6) is more
      concise and complete. Ducange, who adopts these adventurers as
      French, has hunted their footsteps with his usual diligence,
      (Hist. de C. P. l. vi. c. 22—46.) He quotes an Arragonese
      history, which I have read with pleasure, and which the Spaniards
      extol as a model of style and composition, (Expedicion de los
      Catalanes y Arragoneses contra Turcos y Griegos: Barcelona, 1623
      in quarto: Madrid, 1777, in octavo.) Don Francisco de Moncada
      Conde de Ossona, may imitate Cæsar or Sallust; he may transcribe
      the Greek or Italian contemporaries: but he never quotes his
      authorities, and I cannot discern any national records of the
      exploits of his countrymen. * Note: Ramon de Montaner, one of the
      Catalans, who accompanied Roger de Flor, and who was governor of
      Gallipoli, has written, in Spanish, the history of this band of
      adventurers, to which he belonged, and from which he separated
      when it left the Thracian Chersonese to penetrate into Macedonia
      and Greece.—G.——The autobiography of Ramon de Montaner has been
      published in French by M. Buchon, in the great collection of
      Mémoires relatifs à l’Histoire de France. I quote this
      edition.—M.]

      After some ages of oblivion, Greece was awakened to new
      misfortunes by the arms of the Latins. In the two hundred and
      fifty years between the first and the last conquest of
      Constantinople, that venerable land was disputed by a multitude
      of petty tyrants; without the comforts of freedom and genius, her
      ancient cities were again plunged in foreign and intestine war;
      and, if servitude be preferable to anarchy, they might repose
      with joy under the Turkish yoke. I shall not pursue the obscure
      and various dynasties, that rose and fell on the continent or in
      the isles; but our silence on the fate of Athens 51 would argue a
      strange ingratitude to the first and purest school of liberal
      science and amusement. In the partition of the empire, the
      principality of Athens and Thebes was assigned to Otho de la
      Roche, a noble warrior of Burgundy, 52 with the title of great
      duke, 53 which the Latins understood in their own sense, and the
      Greeks more foolishly derived from the age of Constantine. 54
      Otho followed the standard of the marquis of Montferrat: the
      ample state which he acquired by a miracle of conduct or fortune,
      55 was peaceably inherited by his son and two grandsons, till the
      family, though not the nation, was changed, by the marriage of an
      heiress into the elder branch of the house of Brienne. The son of
      that marriage, Walter de Brienne, succeeded to the duchy of
      Athens; and, with the aid of some Catalan mercenaries, whom he
      invested with fiefs, reduced above thirty castles of the vassal
      or neighboring lords. But when he was informed of the approach
      and ambition of the great company, he collected a force of seven
      hundred knights, six thousand four hundred horse, and eight
      thousand foot, and boldly met them on the banks of the River
      Cephisus in Botia. The Catalans amounted to no more than three
      thousand five hundred horse, and four thousand foot; but the
      deficiency of numbers was compensated by stratagem and order.
      They formed round their camp an artificial inundation; the duke
      and his knights advanced without fear or precaution on the
      verdant meadow; their horses plunged into the bog; and he was cut
      in pieces, with the greatest part of the French cavalry. His
      family and nation were expelled; and his son Walter de Brienne,
      the titular duke of Athens, the tyrant of Florence, and the
      constable of France, lost his life in the field of Poitiers
      Attica and Botia were the rewards of the victorious Catalans;
      they married the widows and daughters of the slain; and during
      fourteen years, the great company was the terror of the Grecian
      states. Their factions drove them to acknowledge the sovereignty
      of the house of Arragon; and during the remainder of the
      fourteenth century, Athens, as a government or an appanage, was
      successively bestowed by the kings of Sicily. After the French
      and Catalans, the third dynasty was that of the Accaioli, a
      family, plebeian at Florence, potent at Naples, and sovereign in
      Greece. Athens, which they embellished with new buildings, became
      the capital of a state, that extended over Thebes, Argos,
      Corinth, Delphi, and a part of Thessaly; and their reign was
      finally determined by Mahomet the Second, who strangled the last
      duke, and educated his sons in the discipline and religion of the
      seraglio.

      51 (return) [ See the laborious history of Ducange, whose
      accurate table of the French dynasties recapitulates the
      thirty-five passages, in which he mentions the dukes of Athens.]

      52 (return) [ He is twice mentioned by Villehardouin with honor,
      (No. 151, 235;) and under the first passage, Ducange observes all
      that can be known of his person and family.]

      53 (return) [ From these Latin princes of the xivth century,
      Boccace, Chaucer. and Shakspeare, have borrowed their Theseus
      _duke_ of Athens. An ignorant age transfers its own language and
      manners to the most distant times.]

      54 (return) [ The same Constantine gave to Sicily a king, to
      Russia the _magnus dapifer_ of the empire, to Thebes the
      _primicerius_; and these absurd fables are properly lashed by
      Ducange, (ad Nicephor. Greg. l. vii. c. 5.) By the Latins, the
      lord of Thebes was styled, by corruption, the Megas Kurios, or
      Grand Sire!]

      55 (return) [ _Quodam miraculo_, says Alberic. He was probably
      received by Michael Choniates, the archbishop who had defended
      Athens against the tyrant Leo Sgurus, (Nicetas urbs capta, p.
      805, ed. Bek.) Michael was the brother of the historian Nicetas;
      and his encomium of Athens is still extant in MS. in the Bodleian
      library, (Fabric. Bibliot. Græc tom. vi. p. 405.) * Note: Nicetas
      says expressly that Michael surrendered the Acropolis to the
      marquis.—M.]

      Athens, 56 though no more than the shadow of her former self,
      still contains about eight or ten thousand inhabitants; of these,
      three fourths are Greeks in religion and language; and the Turks,
      who compose the remainder, have relaxed, in their intercourse
      with the citizens, somewhat of the pride and gravity of their
      national character. The olive-tree, the gift of Minerva,
      flourishes in Attica; nor has the honey of Mount Hymettus lost
      any part of its exquisite flavor: 57 but the languid trade is
      monopolized by strangers, and the agriculture of a barren land is
      abandoned to the vagrant Walachians. The Athenians are still
      distinguished by the subtlety and acuteness of their
      understandings; but these qualities, unless ennobled by freedom,
      and enlightened by study, will degenerate into a low and selfish
      cunning: and it is a proverbial saying of the country, “From the
      Jews of Thessalonica, the Turks of Negropont, and the Greeks of
      Athens, good Lord deliver us!” This artful people has eluded the
      tyranny of the Turkish bashaws, by an expedient which alleviates
      their servitude and aggravates their shame. About the middle of
      the last century, the Athenians chose for their protector the
      Kislar Aga, or chief black eunuch of the seraglio. This Æthiopian
      slave, who possesses the sultan’s ear, condescends to accept the
      tribute of thirty thousand crowns: his lieutenant, the Waywode,
      whom he annually confirms, may reserve for his own about five or
      six thousand more; and such is the policy of the citizens, that
      they seldom fail to remove and punish an oppressive governor.
      Their private differences are decided by the archbishop, one of
      the richest prelates of the Greek church, since he possesses a
      revenue of one thousand pounds sterling; and by a tribunal of the
      eight _geronti_ or elders, chosen in the eight quarters of the
      city: the noble families cannot trace their pedigree above three
      hundred years; but their principal members are distinguished by a
      grave demeanor, a fur cap, and the lofty appellation of _archon_.
      By some, who delight in the contrast, the modern language of
      Athens is represented as the most corrupt and barbarous of the
      seventy dialects of the vulgar Greek: 58 this picture is too
      darkly colored: but it would not be easy, in the country of Plato
      and Demosthenes, to find a reader or a copy of their works. The
      Athenians walk with supine indifference among the glorious ruins
      of antiquity; and such is the debasement of their character, that
      they are incapable of admiring the genius of their predecessors.

      of Athens, passim,) and Chandler, (Travels into Greece, p.

      1676; the last, 1765; and ninety years had not produced much
      difference in the tranquil scene.]

      57 (return) [ The ancients, or at least the Athenians, believed
      that all the bees in the world had been propagated from Mount
      Hymettus. They taught, that health might be preserved, and life
      prolonged, by the external use of oil, and the internal use of
      honey, (Geoponica, l. xv. c 7, p. 1089—1094, edit. Niclas.)]

      judges, entertain a more favorable opinion of the Attic dialect.]

      59 (return) [ Yet we must not accuse them of corrupting the name
      of Athens, which they still call Athini. From the eiV thn
      'Aqhnhn, we have formed our own barbarism of _Setines_. * Note:
