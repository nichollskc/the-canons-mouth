Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.—Part I.

     Reign And Conversion Of Clovis.—His Victories Over The Alemanni,
     Burgundians, And Visigoths.—Establishment Of The French Monarchy
     In Gaul.—Laws Of The Barbarians.—State Of The Romans.—The
     Visigoths Of Spain.—Conquest Of Britain By The Saxons.

      The Gauls, 1 who impatiently supported the Roman yoke, received a
      memorable lesson from one of the lieutenants of Vespasian, whose
      weighty sense has been refined and expressed by the genius of
      Tacitus. 2 “The protection of the republic has delivered Gaul
      from internal discord and foreign invasions. By the loss of
      national independence, you have acquired the name and privileges
      of Roman citizens. You enjoy, in common with yourselves, the
      permanent benefits of civil government; and your remote situation
      is less exposed to the accidental mischiefs of tyranny. Instead
      of exercising the rights of conquest, we have been contented to
      impose such tributes as are requisite for your own preservation.
      Peace cannot be secured without armies; and armies must be
      supported at the expense of the people. It is for your sake, not
      for our own, that we guard the barrier of the Rhine against the
      ferocious Germans, who have so often attempted, and who will
      always desire, to exchange the solitude of their woods and
      morasses for the wealth and fertility of Gaul. The fall of Rome
      would be fatal to the provinces; and you would be buried in the
      ruins of that mighty fabric, which has been raised by the valor
      and wisdom of eight hundred years. Your imaginary freedom would
      be insulted and oppressed by a savage master; and the expulsion
      of the Romans would be succeeded by the eternal hostilities of
      the Barbarian conquerors.” 3 This salutary advice was accepted,
      and this strange prediction was accomplished. In the space of
      four hundred years, the hardy Gauls, who had encountered the arms
      of Caesar, were imperceptibly melted into the general mass of
      citizens and subjects: the Western empire was dissolved; and the
      Germans, who had passed the Rhine, fiercely contended for the
      possession of Gaul, and excited the contempt, or abhorrence, of
      its peaceful and polished inhabitants. With that conscious pride
      which the preeminence of knowledge and luxury seldom fails to
      inspire, they derided the hairy and gigantic savages of the
      North; their rustic manners, dissonant joy, voracious appetite,
      and their horrid appearance, equally disgusting to the sight and
      to the smell. The liberal studies were still cultivated in the
      schools of Autun and Bordeaux; and the language of Cicero and
      Virgil was familiar to the Gallic youth. Their ears were
      astonished by the harsh and unknown sounds of the Germanic
      dialect, and they ingeniously lamented that the trembling muses
      fled from the harmony of a Burgundian lyre. The Gauls were
      endowed with all the advantages of art and nature; but as they
      wanted courage to defend them, they were justly condemned to
      obey, and even to flatter, the victorious Barbarians, by whose
      clemency they held their precarious fortunes and their lives. 4

      Recueil des Historiens des Gaules et de la France, Paris,
      1738-1767, in eleven volumes in folio. By the labor of Dom
      Bouquet, and the other Benedictines, all the original
      testimonies, as far as A.D. 1060, are disposed in chronological
      order, and illustrated with learned notes. Such a national work,
      which will be continued to the year 1500, might provoke our
      emulation.]

      and pleasantry, the hardships of his situation, (Carm. xii. in
      tom. i. p. 811.)]

      As soon as Odoacer had extinguished the Western empire, he sought
      the friendship of the most powerful of the Barbarians. The new
      sovereign of Italy resigned to Euric, king of the Visigoths, all
      the Roman conquests beyond the Alps, as far as the Rhine and the
      Ocean: 5 and the senate might confirm this liberal gift with some
      ostentation of power, and without any real loss of revenue and
      dominion. The lawful pretensions of Euric were justified by
      ambition and success; and the Gothic nation might aspire, under
      his command, to the monarchy of Spain and Gaul. Arles and
      Marseilles surrendered to his arms: he oppressed the freedom of
      Auvergne; and the bishop condescended to purchase his recall from
      exile by a tribute of just, but reluctant praise. Sidonius waited
      before the gates of the palace among a crowd of ambassadors and
      suppliants; and their various business at the court of Bordeaux
      attested the power, and the renown, of the king of the Visigoths.
      The Heruli of the distant ocean, who painted their naked bodies
      with its coerulean color, implored his protection; and the Saxons
      respected the maritime provinces of a prince, who was destitute
      of any naval force. The tall Burgundians submitted to his
      authority; nor did he restore the captive Franks, till he had
      imposed on that fierce nation the terms of an unequal peace. The
      Vandals of Africa cultivated his useful friendship; and the
      Ostrogoths of Pannonia were supported by his powerful aid against
      the oppression of the neighboring Huns. The North (such are the
      lofty strains of the poet) was agitated or appeased by the nod of
      Euric; the great king of Persia consulted the oracle of the West;
      and the aged god of the Tyber was protected by the swelling
      genius of the Garonne. 6 The fortune of nations has often
      depended on accidents; and France may ascribe her greatness to
      the premature death of the Gothic king, at a time when his son
      Alaric was a helpless infant, and his adversary Clovis 7 an
      ambitious and valiant youth.

      measure, this portrait of the Gothic hero.]

      7 (return) [ I use the familiar appellation of Clovis, from the
      Latin Chlodovechus, or Chlodovoeus. But the Ch expresses only the
      German aspiration, and the true name is not different from Lewis,
      (Mem. de ‘Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xx. p. 68.)]

      While Childeric, the father of Clovis, lived an exile in Germany,
      he was hospitably entertained by the queen, as well as by the
      king, of the Thuringians. After his restoration, Basina escaped
      from her husband’s bed to the arms of her lover; freely
      declaring, that if she had known a man wiser, stronger, or more
      beautiful, than Childeric, that man should have been the object
      of her preference. 8 9 Clovis was the offspring of this voluntary
      union; and, when he was no more than fifteen years of age, he
      succeeded, by his father’s death, to the command of the Salian
      tribe. The narrow limits of his kingdom were confined to the
      island of the Batavians, with the ancient dioceses of Tournay and
      Arras; 10 and at the baptism of Clovis the number of his warriors
      could not exceed five thousand. The kindred tribes of the Franks,
      who had seated themselves along the Belgic rivers, the Scheld,
      the Meuse, the Moselle, and the Rhine, were governed by their
      independent kings, of the Merovingian race; the equals, the
      allies, and sometimes the enemies of the Salic prince. But the
      Germans, who obeyed, in peace, the hereditary jurisdiction of
      their chiefs, were free to follow the standard of a popular and
      victorious general; and the superior merit of Clovis attracted
      the respect and allegiance of the national confederacy. When he
      first took the field, he had neither gold and silver in his
      coffers, nor wine and corn in his magazine; 11 but he imitated
      the example of Caesar, who, in the same country, had acquired
      wealth by the sword, and purchased soldiers with the fruits of
      conquest. After each successful battle or expedition, the spoils
      were accumulated in one common mass; every warrior received his
      proportionable share; and the royal prerogative submitted to the
      equal regulations of military law. The untamed spirit of the
      Barbarians was taught to acknowledge the advantages of regular
      discipline. 12 At the annual review of the month of March, their
      arms were diligently inspected; and when they traversed a
      peaceful territory, they were prohibited from touching a blade of
      grass. The justice of Clovis was inexorable; and his careless or
      disobedient soldiers were punished with instant death. It would
      be superfluous to praise the valor of a Frank; but the valor of
      Clovis was directed by cool and consummate prudence. 13 In all
      his transactions with mankind, he calculated the weight of
      interest, of passion, and of opinion; and his measures were
      sometimes adapted to the sanguinary manners of the Germans, and
      sometimes moderated by the milder genius of Rome, and
      Christianity. He was intercepted in the career of victory, since
      he died in the forty-fifth year of his age: but he had already
      accomplished, in a reign of thirty years, the establishment of
      the French monarchy in Gaul.

      8 (return) [ Greg. l. ii. c. 12, in tom. i. p. 168. Basina speaks
      the language of nature; the Franks, who had seen her in their
      youth, might converse with Gregory in their old age; and the
      bishop of Tours could not wish to defame the mother of the first
      Christian king.]

      9 (return) [ The Abbe Dubos (Hist. Critique de l’Etablissement de
      la Monarchie Francoise dans les Gaules, tom. i. p. 630-650) has
      the merit of defining the primitive kingdom of Clovis, and of
      ascertaining the genuine number of his subjects.]

      possessed by the Pagans many years before the baptism of Clovis.]

      11 (return) [ Gregory of Tours (l v. c. i. tom. ii. p. 232)
      contrasts the poverty of Clovis with the wealth of his grandsons.
      Yet Remigius (in tom. iv. p. 52) mentions his paternas opes, as
      sufficient for the redemption of captives.]

      12 (return) [ See Gregory, (l. ii. c. 27, 37, in tom. ii. p. 175,
      181, 182.) The famous story of the vase of Soissons explains both
      the power and the character of Clovis. As a point of controversy,
      it has been strangely tortured by Boulainvilliers Dubos, and the
      other political antiquarians.]

      13 (return) [ The duke of Nivernois, a noble statesman, who has
      managed weighty and delicate negotiations, ingeniously
      illustrates (Mem. de l’Acad. des Inscriptions, tom. xx. p.
      147-184) the political system of Clovis.]

      The first exploit of Clovis was the defeat of Syagrius, the son
      of Aegidius; and the public quarrel might, on this occasion, be
      inflamed by private resentment. The glory of the father still
      insulted the Merovingian race; the power of the son might excite
      the jealous ambition of the king of the Franks. Syagrius
      inherited, as a patrimonial estate, the city and diocese of
      Soissons: the desolate remnant of the second Belgic, Rheims and
      Troyes, Beauvais and Amiens, would naturally submit to the count
      or patrician: 14 and after the dissolution of the Western empire,
      he might reign with the title, or at least with the authority, of
      king of the Romans. 15 As a Roman, he had been educated in the
      liberal studies of rhetoric and jurisprudence; but he was engaged
      by accident and policy in the familiar use of the Germanic idiom.
      The independent Barbarians resorted to the tribunal of a
      stranger, who possessed the singular talent of explaining, in
      their native tongue, the dictates of reason and equity. The
      diligence and affability of their judge rendered him popular, the
      impartial wisdom of his decrees obtained their voluntary
      obedience, and the reign of Syagrius over the Franks and
      Burgundians seemed to revive the original institution of civil
      society. 16 In the midst of these peaceful occupations, Syagrius
      received, and boldly accepted, the hostile defiance of Clovis;
      who challenged his rival in the spirit, and almost in the
      language, of chivalry, to appoint the day and the field 17 of
      battle. In the time of Caesar Soissons would have poured forth a
      body of fifty thousand horse and such an army might have been
      plentifully supplied with shields, cuirasses, and military
      engines, from the three arsenals or manufactures of the city. 18
      But the courage and numbers of the Gallic youth were long since
      exhausted; and the loose bands of volunteers, or mercenaries, who
      marched under the standard of Syagrius, were incapable of
      contending with the national valor of the Franks. It would be
      ungenerous without some more accurate knowledge of his strength
      and resources, to condemn the rapid flight of Syagrius, who
      escaped, after the loss of a battle, to the distant court of
      Thoulouse. The feeble minority of Alaric could not assist or
      protect an unfortunate fugitive; the pusillanimous 19 Goths were
      intimidated by the menaces of Clovis; and the Roman king, after a
      short confinement, was delivered into the hands of the
      executioner. The Belgic cities surrendered to the king of the
      Franks; and his dominions were enlarged towards the East by the
      ample diocese of Tongres 20 which Clovis subdued in the tenth
      year of his reign.

      14 (return) [ M. Biet (in a Dissertation which deserved the prize
      of the Academy of Soissons, p. 178-226,) has accurately defined
      the nature and extent of the kingdom of Syagrius and his father;
      but he too readily allows the slight evidence of Dubos (tom. ii.
      p. 54-57) to deprive him of Beauvais and Amiens.]

      15 (return) [ I may observe that Fredegarius, in his epitome of
      Gregory of Tours, (tom. ii. p. 398,) has prudently substituted
      the name of Patricius for the incredible title of Rex Romanorum.]

      16 (return) [ Sidonius, (l. v. Epist. 5, in tom. i. p. 794,) who
      styles him the Solon, the Amphion, of the Barbarians, addresses
      this imaginary king in the tone of friendship and equality. From
      such offices of arbitration, the crafty Dejoces had raised
      himself to the throne of the Medes, (Herodot. l. i. c. 96-100.)]

      17 (return) [ Campum sibi praeparari jussit. M. Biet (p. 226-251)
      has diligently ascertained this field of battle, at Nogent, a
      Benedictine abbey, about ten miles to the north of Soissons. The
      ground was marked by a circle of Pagan sepulchres; and Clovis
      bestowed the adjacent lands of Leully and Coucy on the church of
      Rheims.]

      18 (return) [ See Caesar. Comment. de Bell. Gallic. ii. 4, in
      tom. i. p. 220, and the Notitiae, tom. i. p. 126. The three
      Fabricae of Soissons were, Seutaria, Balistaria, and Clinabaria.
      The last supplied the complete armor of the heavy cuirassiers.]

      19 (return) [ The epithet must be confined to the circumstances;
      and history cannot justify the French prejudice of Gregory, (l.
      ii. c. 27, in tom. ii. p. 175,) ut Gothorum pavere mos est.]

      20 (return) [ Dubos has satisfied me (tom. i. p. 277-286) that
      Gregory of Tours, his transcribers, or his readers, have
      repeatedly confounded the German kingdom of Thuringia, beyond the
      Rhine, and the Gallic city of Tongria, on the Meuse, which was
      more anciently the country of the Eburones, and more recently the
      diocese of Liege.]

      The name of the Alemanni has been absurdly derived from their
      imaginary settlement on the banks of the Leman Lake. 21 That
      fortunate district, from the lake to the Avenche, and Mount Jura,
      was occupied by the Burgundians. 22 The northern parts of
      Helvetia had indeed been subdued by the ferocious Alemanni, who
      destroyed with their own hands the fruits of their conquest. A
      province, improved and adorned by the arts of Rome, was again
      reduced to a savage wilderness; and some vestige of the stately
      Vindonissa may still be discovered in the fertile and populous
      valley of the Aar. 23 From the source of the Rhine to its conflux
      with the Mein and the Moselle, the formidable swarms of the
      Alemanni commanded either side of the river, by the right of
      ancient possession, or recent victory. They had spread themselves
      into Gaul, over the modern provinces of Alsace and Lorraine; and
      their bold invasion of the kingdom of Cologne summoned the Salic
      prince to the defence of his Ripuarian allies.

      Clovis encountered the invaders of Gaul in the plain of Tolbiac,
      about twenty-four miles from Cologne; and the two fiercest
      nations of Germany were mutually animated by the memory of past
      exploits, and the prospect of future greatness. The Franks, after
      an obstinate struggle, gave way; and the Alemanni, raising a
      shout of victory, impetuously pressed their retreat. But the
      battle was restored by the valor, and the conduct, and perhaps by
      the piety, of Clovis; and the event of the bloody day decided
      forever the alternative of empire or servitude. The last king of
      the Alemanni was slain in the field, and his people were
      slaughtered or pursued, till they threw down their arms, and
      yielded to the mercy of the conqueror. Without discipline it was
      impossible for them to rally: they had contemptuously demolished
      the walls and fortifications which might have protected their
      distress; and they were followed into the heart of their forests
      by an enemy not less active, or intrepid, than themselves. The
      great Theodoric congratulated the victory of Clovis, whose sister
      Albofleda the king of Italy had lately married; but he mildly
      interceded with his brother in favor of the suppliants and
      fugitives, who had implored his protection. The Gallic
      territories, which were possessed by the Alemanni, became the
      prize of their conqueror; and the haughty nation, invincible, or
      rebellious, to the arms of Rome, acknowledged the sovereignty of
      the Merovingian kings, who graciously permitted them to enjoy
      their peculiar manners and institutions, under the government of
      official, and, at length, of hereditary, dukes. After the
      conquest of the Western provinces, the Franks alone maintained
      their ancient habitations beyond the Rhine. They gradually
      subdued, and civilized, the exhausted countries, as far as the
      Elbe, and the mountains of Bohemia; and the peace of Europe was
      secured by the obedience of Germany. 24

      Alemannia, and the Transjurane Burgundy. They were commensurate
      with the dioceses of Constance and Avenche, or Lausanne, and are
      still discriminated, in modern Switzerland, by the use of the

      monuments of Roman conquest of feudal or Austrian tyranny, of
      monkish superstition, and of industrious freedom. If he be truly
      a philosopher, he will applaud the merit and happiness of his own
      times.]

      the epistle of Theodoric, (Cassiodor. Variar. l. ii. c. 41, in
      tom. iv. p. 4,) represent the defeat of the Alemanni. Some of
      their tribes settled in Rhaetia, under the protection of
      Theodoric; whose successors ceded the colony and their country to
      the grandson of Clovis. The state of the Alemanni under the
      Merovingian kings may be seen in Mascou (Hist. of the Ancient
      Germans, xi. 8, &c. Annotation xxxvi.) and Guilliman, (de Reb.
      Helvet. l. ii. c. 10-12, p. 72-80.)]

      Till the thirtieth year of his age, Clovis continued to worship
      the gods of his ancestors. 25 His disbelief, or rather disregard,
      of Christianity, might encourage him to pillage with less remorse
      the churches of a hostile territory: but his subjects of Gaul
      enjoyed the free exercise of religious worship; and the bishops
      entertained a more favorable hope of the idolater, than of the
      heretics. The Merovingian prince had contracted a fortunate
      alliance with the fair Clotilda, the niece of the king of
      Burgundy, who, in the midst of an Arian court, was educated in
      the profession of the Catholic faith. It was her interest, as
      well as her duty, to achieve the conversion 26 of a Pagan
      husband; and Clovis insensibly listened to the voice of love and
      religion. He consented (perhaps such terms had been previously
      stipulated) to the baptism of his eldest son; and though the
      sudden death of the infant excited some superstitious fears, he
      was persuaded, a second time, to repeat the dangerous experiment.
      In the distress of the battle of Tolbiac, Clovis loudly invoked
      the God of Clotilda and the Christians; and victory disposed him
      to hear, with respectful gratitude, the eloquent 27 Remigius, 28
      bishop of Rheims, who forcibly displayed the temporal and
      spiritual advantages of his conversion. The king declared himself
      satisfied of the truth of the Catholic faith; and the political
      reasons which might have suspended his public profession, were
      removed by the devout or loyal acclamations of the Franks, who
      showed themselves alike prepared to follow their heroic leader to
      the field of battle, or to the baptismal font. The important
      ceremony was performed in the cathedral of Rheims, with every
      circumstance of magnificence and solemnity that could impress an
      awful sense of religion on the minds of its rude proselytes. 29
      The new Constantine was immediately baptized, with three thousand
      of his warlike subjects; and their example was imitated by the
      remainder of the gentle Barbarians, who, in obedience to the
      victorious prelate, adored the cross which they had burnt, and
      burnt the idols which they had formerly adored. 30 The mind of
      Clovis was susceptible of transient fervor: he was exasperated by
      the pathetic tale of the passion and death of Christ; and,
      instead of weighing the salutary consequences of that mysterious
      sacrifice, he exclaimed, with indiscreet fury, “Had I been
      present at the head of my valiant Franks, I would have revenged
      his injuries.” 31 But the savage conqueror of Gaul was incapable
      of examining the proofs of a religion, which depends on the
      laborious investigation of historic evidence and speculative
      theology. He was still more incapable of feeling the mild
      influence of the gospel, which persuades and purifies the heart
      of a genuine convert. His ambitious reign was a perpetual
      violation of moral and Christian duties: his hands were stained
      with blood in peace as well as in war; and, as soon as Clovis had
      dismissed a synod of the Gallican church, he calmly assassinated
      all the princes of the Merovingian race. 32 Yet the king of the
      Franks might sincerely worship the Christian God, as a Being more
      excellent and powerful than his national deities; and the signal
      deliverance and victory of Tolbiac encouraged Clovis to confide
      in the future protection of the Lord of Hosts. Martin, the most
      popular of the saints, had filled the Western world with the fame
      of those miracles which were incessantly performed at his holy
      sepulchre of Tours. His visible or invisible aid promoted the
      cause of a liberal and orthodox prince; and the profane remark of
      Clovis himself, that St.Martin was an expensive friend, 33 need
      not be interpreted as the symptom of any permanent or rational
      scepticism. But earth, as well as heaven, rejoiced in the
      conversion of the Franks. On the memorable day when Clovis
      ascended from the baptismal font, he alone, in the Christian
      world, deserved the name and prerogatives of a Catholic king. The
      emperor Anastasius entertained some dangerous errors concerning
      the nature of the divine incarnation; and the Barbarians of
      Italy, Africa, Spain, and Gaul, were involved in the Arian
      heresy. The eldest, or rather the only, son of the church, was
      acknowledged by the clergy as their lawful sovereign, or glorious
      deliverer; and the armies of Clovis were strenuously supported by
      the zeal and fervor of the Catholic faction. 34

      Latin bishops would assure him of their joy and attachment.]

      Under the Roman empire, the wealth and jurisdiction of the
      bishops, their sacred character, and perpetual office, their
      numerous dependants, popular eloquence, and provincial
      assemblies, had rendered them always respectable, and sometimes
      dangerous. Their influence was augmented with the progress of
      superstition; and the establishment of the French monarchy may,
      in some degree, be ascribed to the firm alliance of a hundred
      prelates, who reigned in the discontented, or independent, cities
      of Gaul. The slight foundations of the Armorican republic had
      been repeatedly shaken, or overthrown; but the same people still
      guarded their domestic freedom; asserted the dignity of the Roman
      name; and bravely resisted the predatory inroads, and regular
      attacks, of Clovis, who labored to extend his conquests from the
      Seine to the Loire. Their successful opposition introduced an
      equal and honorable union. The Franks esteemed the valor of the
      Armoricans 35 and the Armoricans were reconciled by the religion
      of the Franks. The military force which had been stationed for
      the defence of Gaul, consisted of one hundred different bands of
      cavalry or infantry; and these troops, while they assumed the
      title and privileges of Roman soldiers, were renewed by an
      incessant supply of the Barbarian youth. The extreme
      fortifications, and scattered fragments of the empire, were still
      defended by their hopeless courage. But their retreat was
      intercepted, and their communication was impracticable: they were
      abandoned by the Greek princes of Constantinople, and they
      piously disclaimed all connection with the Arian usurpers of
      Gaul. They accepted, without shame or reluctance, the generous
      capitulation, which was proposed by a Catholic hero; and this
      spurious, or legitimate, progeny of the Roman legions, was
      distinguished in the succeeding age by their arms, their ensigns,
      and their peculiar dress and institutions. But the national
      strength was increased by these powerful and voluntary
      accessions; and the neighboring kingdoms dreaded the numbers, as
      well as the spirit, of the Franks. The reduction of the Northern
      provinces of Gaul, instead of being decided by the chance of a
      single battle, appears to have been slowly effected by the
      gradual operation of war and treaty and Clovis acquired each
      object of his ambition, by such efforts, or such concessions, as
      were adequate to its real value. His savage character, and the
      virtues of Henry IV., suggest the most opposite ideas of human
      nature; yet some resemblance may be found in the situation of two
      princes, who conquered France by their valor, their policy, and
      the merits of a seasonable conversion. 36

      Rome; and not a confederacy of Gallic cities, which had revolted
      from the empire. * Note: Compare Hallam’s Europe during the

      of the French monarchy. Yet I must observe, 1. That the Greek
      historian betrays an inexcusable ignorance of the geography of
      the West. 2. That these treaties and privileges, which should
      leave some lasting traces, are totally invisible in Gregory of
      Tours, the Salic laws, &c.]

      The kingdom of the Burgundians, which was defined by the course
      of two Gallic rivers, the Saone and the Rhone, extended from the
      forest of Vosges to the Alps and the sea of Marscilles. 37 The
      sceptre was in the hands of Gundobald. That valiant and ambitious
      prince had reduced the number of royal candidates by the death of
      two brothers, one of whom was the father of Clotilda; 38 but his
      imperfect prudence still permitted Godegisel, the youngest of his
      brothers, to possess the dependent principality of Geneva. The
      Arian monarch was justly alarmed by the satisfaction, and the
      hopes, which seemed to animate his clergy and people after the
      conversion of Clovis; and Gundobald convened at Lyons an assembly
      of his bishops, to reconcile, if it were possible, their
      religious and political discontents. A vain conference was
      agitated between the two factions. The Arians upbraided the
      Catholics with the worship of three Gods: the Catholics defended
      their cause by theological distinctions; and the usual arguments,
      objections, and replies were reverberated with obstinate clamor;
      till the king revealed his secret apprehensions, by an abrupt but
      decisive question, which he addressed to the orthodox bishops.
      “If you truly profess the Christian religion, why do you not
      restrain the king of the Franks? He has declared war against me,
      and forms alliances with my enemies for my destruction. A
      sanguinary and covetous mind is not the symptom of a sincere
      conversion: let him show his faith by his works.” The answer of
      Avitus, bishop of Vienna, who spoke in the name of his brethren,
      was delivered with the voice and countenance of an angel. “We are
      ignorant of the motives and intentions of the king of the Franks:
      but we are taught by Scripture, that the kingdoms which abandon
      the divine law are frequently subverted; and that enemies will
      arise on every side against those who have made God their enemy.
      Return, with thy people, to the law of God, and he will give
      peace and security to thy dominions.” The king of Burgundy, who
      was not prepared to accept the condition which the Catholics
      considered as essential to the treaty, delayed and dismissed the
      ecclesiastical conference; after reproaching his bishops, that
      Clovis, their friend and proselyte, had privately tempted the
      allegiance of his brother. 39

      Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.—Part II.

      The allegiance of his brother was already seduced; and the
      obedience of Godegisel, who joined the royal standard with the
      troops of Geneva, more effectually promoted the success of the
      conspiracy. While the Franks and Burgundians contended with equal
      valor, his seasonable desertion decided the event of the battle;
      and as Gundobald was faintly supported by the disaffected Gauls,
      he yielded to the arms of Clovis, and hastily retreated from the
      field, which appears to have been situate between Langres and
      Dijon. He distrusted the strength of Dijon, a quadrangular
      fortress, encompassed by two rivers, and by a wall thirty feet
      high, and fifteen thick, with four gates, and thirty-three
      towers: 40 he abandoned to the pursuit of Clovis the important
      cities of Lyons and Vienna; and Gundobald still fled with
      precipitation, till he had reached Avignon, at the distance of
      two hundred and fifty miles from the field of battle.

      A long siege and an artful negotiation, admonished the king of
      the Franks of the danger and difficulty of his enterprise. He
      imposed a tribute on the Burgundian prince, compelled him to
      pardon and reward his brother’s treachery, and proudly returned
      to his own dominions, with the spoils and captives of the
      southern provinces. This splendid triumph was soon clouded by the
      intelligence, that Gundobald had violated his recent obligations,
      and that the unfortunate Godegisel, who was left at Vienna with a
      garrison of five thousand Franks, 41 had been besieged,
      surprised, and massacred by his inhuman brother. Such an outrage
      might have exasperated the patience of the most peaceful
      sovereign; yet the conqueror of Gaul dissembled the injury,
      released the tribute, and accepted the alliance, and military
      service, of the king of Burgundy. Clovis no longer possessed
      those advantages which had assured the success of the preceding
      war; and his rival, instructed by adversity, had found new
      resources in the affections of his people. The Gauls or Romans
      applauded the mild and impartial laws of Gundobald, which almost
      raised them to the same level with their conquerors. The bishops
      were reconciled, and flattered, by the hopes, which he artfully
      suggested, of his approaching conversion; and though he eluded
      their accomplishment to the last moment of his life, his
      moderation secured the peace, and suspended the ruin, of the
      kingdom of Burgundy. 42

      deserved the title of a city. It depended on the bishops of

      king of the Visigoths, who settled them in the territory of
      Thoulouse.]

      narrative appears so incompatible with that of Procopius, (de
      Bell. Goth. l. i. c. 12, in tom. ii. p. 31, 32,) that some
      critics have supposed two different wars. The Abbe Dubos (Hist.
      Critique, &c., tom. ii. p. 126-162) has distinctly represented
      the causes and the events.]

      I am impatient to pursue the final ruin of that kingdom, which
      was accomplished under the reign of Sigismond, the son of
      Gundobald. The Catholic Sigismond has acquired the honors of a
      saint and martyr; 43 but the hands of the royal saint were
      stained with the blood of his innocent son, whom he inhumanly
      sacrificed to the pride and resentment of a step-mother. He soon
      discovered his error, and bewailed the irreparable loss. While
      Sigismond embraced the corpse of the unfortunate youth, he
      received a severe admonition from one of his attendants: “It is
      not his situation, O king! it is thine which deserves pity and
      lamentation.” The reproaches of a guilty conscience were
      alleviated, however, by his liberal donations to the monastery of
      Agaunum, or St. Maurice, in Vallais; which he himself had founded
      in honor of the imaginary martyrs of the Thebaean legion. 44 A
      full chorus of perpetual psalmody was instituted by the pious
      king; he assiduously practised the austere devotion of the monks;
      and it was his humble prayer, that Heaven would inflict in this
      world the punishment of his sins. His prayer was heard: the
      avengers were at hand: and the provinces of Burgundy were
      overwhelmed by an army of victorious Franks. After the event of
      an unsuccessful battle, Sigismond, who wished to protract his
      life that he might prolong his penance, concealed himself in the
      desert in a religious habit, till he was discovered and betrayed
      by his subjects, who solicited the favor of their new masters.
      The captive monarch, with his wife and two children, was
      transported to Orleans, and buried alive in a deep well, by the
      stern command of the sons of Clovis; whose cruelty might derive
      some excuse from the maxims and examples of their barbarous age.
      Their ambition, which urged them to achieve the conquest of
      Burgundy, was inflamed, or disguised, by filial piety: and
      Clotilda, whose sanctity did not consist in the forgiveness of
      injuries, pressed them to revenge her father’s death on the
      family of his assassin. The rebellious Burgundians (for they
      attempted to break their chains) were still permitted to enjoy
      their national laws under the obligation of tribute and military
      service; and the Merovingian princes peaceably reigned over a
      kingdom, whose glory and greatness had been first overthrown by
      the arms of Clovis. 45

      515) by the regular monastery of Sigismond. Within fifty years,
      his angels of light made a nocturnal sally to murder their
      bishop, and his clergy. See in the Bibliothèque Raisonnée (tom.
      xxxvi. p. 435-438) the curious remarks of a learned librarian of

      principal facts, of the life of Sigismond, and the conquest of
      Burgundy. Procopius (in tom. ii. p. 34) and Agathias (in tom. ii.
      p. 49) show their remote and imperfect knowledge.]

      The first victory of Clovis had insulted the honor of the Goths.
      They viewed his rapid progress with jealousy and terror; and the
      youthful fame of Alaric was oppressed by the more potent genius
      of his rival. Some disputes inevitably arose on the edge of their
      contiguous dominions; and after the delays of fruitless
      negotiation, a personal interview of the two kings was proposed
      and accepted. The conference of Clovis and Alaric was held in a
      small island of the Loire, near Amboise. They embraced,
      familiarly conversed, and feasted together; and separated with
      the warmest professions of peace and brotherly love. But their
      apparent confidence concealed a dark suspicion of hostile and
      treacherous designs; and their mutual complaints solicited,
      eluded, and disclaimed, a final arbitration. At Paris, which he
      already considered as his royal seat, Clovis declared to an
      assembly of the princes and warriors, the pretence, and the
      motive, of a Gothic war. “It grieves me to see that the Arians
      still possess the fairest portion of Gaul. Let us march against
      them with the aid of God; and, having vanquished the heretics, we
      will possess and divide their fertile provinces.” 46 The Franks,
      who were inspired by hereditary valor and recent zeal, applauded
      the generous design of their monarch; expressed their resolution
      to conquer or die, since death and conquest would be equally
      profitable; and solemnly protested that they would never shave
      their beards till victory should absolve them from that
      inconvenient vow. The enterprise was promoted by the public or
      private exhortations of Clotilda. She reminded her husband how
      effectually some pious foundation would propitiate the Deity, and
      his servants: and the Christian hero, darting his battle-axe with
      a skilful and nervous band, “There, (said he,) on that spot where
      my Francisca, 47 shall fall, will I erect a church in honor of
      the holy apostles.” This ostentatious piety confirmed and
      justified the attachment of the Catholics, with whom he secretly
      corresponded; and their devout wishes were gradually ripened into
      a formidable conspiracy. The people of Aquitain were alarmed by
      the indiscreet reproaches of their Gothic tyrants, who justly
      accused them of preferring the dominion of the Franks: and their
      zealous adherent Quintianus, bishop of Rodez, 48 preached more
      forcibly in his exile than in his diocese. To resist these
      foreign and domestic enemies, who were fortified by the alliance
      of the Burgundians, Alaric collected his troops, far more
      numerous than the military powers of Clovis. The Visigoths
      resumed the exercise of arms, which they had neglected in a long
      and luxurious peace; 49 a select band of valiant and robust
      slaves attended their masters to the field; 50 and the cities of
      Gaul were compelled to furnish their doubtful and reluctant aid.
      Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, who reigned in Italy, had
      labored to maintain the tranquillity of Gaul; and he assumed, or
      affected, for that purpose, the impartial character of a
      mediator. But the sagacious monarch dreaded the rising empire of
      Clovis, and he was firmly engaged to support the national and
      religious cause of the Goths.

      non habere. Such was the salutary, but fruitless, advice of peace
      of reason, and of Theodoric, (Cassiodor. l. iii. ep. 2.)]

      50 (return) [ Montesquieu (Esprit des Loix, l. xv. c. 14)
      mentions and approves the law of the Visigoths, (l. ix. tit. 2,
      in tom. iv. p. 425,) which obliged all masters to arm, and send,
      or lead, into the field a tenth of their slaves.]

      The accidental, or artificial, prodigies which adorned the
      expedition of Clovis, were accepted by a superstitious age, as
      the manifest declaration of the divine favor. He marched from
      Paris; and as he proceeded with decent reverence through the holy
      diocese of Tours, his anxiety tempted him to consult the shrine
      of St. Martin, the sanctuary and the oracle of Gaul. His
      messengers were instructed to remark the words of the Psalm which
      should happen to be chanted at the precise moment when they
      entered the church. Those words most fortunately expressed the
      valor and victory of the champions of Heaven, and the application
      was easily transferred to the new Joshua, the new Gideon, who
      went forth to battle against the enemies of the Lord. 51 Orleans
      secured to the Franks a bridge on the Loire; but, at the distance
      of forty miles from Poitiers, their progress was intercepted by
      an extraordinary swell of the River Vigenna or Vienne; and the
      opposite banks were covered by the encampment of the Visigoths.
      Delay must be always dangerous to Barbarians, who consume the
      country through which they march; and had Clovis possessed
      leisure and materials, it might have been impracticable to
      construct a bridge, or to force a passage, in the face of a
      superior enemy. But the affectionate peasants who were impatient
      to welcome their deliverer, could easily betray some unknown or
      unguarded ford: the merit of the discovery was enhanced by the
      useful interposition of fraud or fiction; and a white hart, of
      singular size and beauty, appeared to guide and animate the march
      of the Catholic army. The counsels of the Visigoths were
      irresolute and distracted. A crowd of impatient warriors,
      presumptuous in their strength, and disdaining to fly before the
      robbers of Germany, excited Alaric to assert in arms the name and
      blood of the conquerors of Rome. The advice of the graver
      chieftains pressed him to elude the first ardor of the Franks;
      and to expect, in the southern provinces of Gaul, the veteran and
      victorious Ostrogoths, whom the king of Italy had already sent to
      his assistance. The decisive moments were wasted in idle
      deliberation the Goths too hastily abandoned, perhaps, an
      advantageous post; and the opportunity of a secure retreat was
      lost by their slow and disorderly motions. After Clovis had
      passed the ford, as it is still named, of the Hart, he advanced
      with bold and hasty steps to prevent the escape of the enemy. His
      nocturnal march was directed by a flaming meteor, suspended in
      the air above the cathedral of Poitiers; and this signal, which
      might be previously concerted with the orthodox successor of St.
      Hilary, was compared to the column of fire that guided the
      Israelites in the desert. At the third hour of the day, about ten
      miles beyond Poitiers, Clovis overtook, and instantly attacked,
      the Gothic army; whose defeat was already prepared by terror and
      confusion. Yet they rallied in their extreme distress, and the
      martial youths, who had clamorously demanded the battle, refused
      to survive the ignominy of flight. The two kings encountered each
      other in single combat. Alaric fell by the hand of his rival; and
      the victorious Frank was saved by the goodness of his cuirass,
      and the vigor of his horse, from the spears of two desperate
      Goths, who furiously rode against him to revenge the death of
      their sovereign. The vague expression of a mountain of the slain,
      serves to indicate a cruel though indefinite slaughter; but
      Gregory has carefully observed, that his valiant countryman
      Apollinaris, the son of Sidonius, lost his life at the head of
      the nobles of Auvergne. Perhaps these suspected Catholics had
      been maliciously exposed to the blind assault of the enemy; and
      perhaps the influence of religion was superseded by personal
      attachment or military honor. 52

      51 (return) [ This mode of divination, by accepting as an omen
      the first sacred words, which in particular circumstances should
      be presented to the eye or ear, was derived from the Pagans; and
      the Psalter, or Bible, was substituted to the poems of Homer and
      Virgil. From the fourth to the fourteenth century, these sortes
      sanctorum, as they are styled, were repeatedly condemned by the
      decrees of councils, and repeatedly practised by kings, bishops,
      and saints. See a curious dissertation of the Abbe du Resnel, in
      the Mémoires de l’Academie, tom. xix. p. 287-310]

      52 (return) [ After correcting the text, or excusing the mistake,
      of Procopius, who places the defeat of Alaric near Carcassone, we
      may conclude, from the evidence of Gregory, Fortunatus, and the
      author of the Gesta Francorum, that the battle was fought in
      campo Vocladensi, on the banks of the Clain, about ten miles to
      the south of Poitiers. Clovis overtook and attacked the Visigoths
      near Vivonne, and the victory was decided near a village still
      named Champagne St. Hilaire. See the Dissertations of the Abbe le
      Boeuf, tom. i. p. 304-331.]

      Such is the empire of Fortune, (if we may still disguise our
      ignorance under that popular name,) that it is almost equally
      difficult to foresee the events of war, or to explain their
      various consequences. A bloody and complete victory has sometimes
      yielded no more than the possession of the field; and the loss of
      ten thousand men has sometimes been sufficient to destroy, in a
      single day, the work of ages. The decisive battle of Poitiers was
      followed by the conquest of Aquitain. Alaric had left behind him
      an infant son, a bastard competitor, factious nobles, and a
      disloyal people; and the remaining forces of the Goths were
      oppressed by the general consternation, or opposed to each other
      in civil discord. The victorious king of the Franks proceeded
      without delay to the siege of Angoulême. At the sound of his
      trumpets the walls of the city imitated the example of Jericho,
      and instantly fell to the ground; a splendid miracle, which may
      be reduced to the supposition, that some clerical engineers had
      secretly undermined the foundations of the rampart. 53 At
      Bordeaux, which had submitted without resistance, Clovis
      established his winter quarters; and his prudent economy
      transported from Thoulouse the royal treasures, which were
      deposited in the capital of the monarchy. The conqueror
      penetrated as far as the confines of Spain; 54 restored the
      honors of the Catholic church; fixed in Aquitain a colony of
      Franks; 55 and delegated to his lieutenants the easy task of
      subduing, or extirpating, the nation of the Visigoths. But the
      Visigoths were protected by the wise and powerful monarch of
      Italy. While the balance was still equal, Theodoric had perhaps
      delayed the march of the Ostrogoths; but their strenuous efforts
      successfully resisted the ambition of Clovis; and the army of the
      Franks, and their Burgundian allies, was compelled to raise the
      siege of Arles, with the loss, as it is said, of thirty thousand
      men. These vicissitudes inclined the fierce spirit of Clovis to
      acquiesce in an advantageous treaty of peace. The Visigoths were
      suffered to retain the possession of Septimania, a narrow tract
      of sea-coast, from the Rhone to the Pyrenees; but the ample
      province of Aquitain, from those mountains to the Loire, was
      indissolubly united to the kingdom of France. 56

      53 (return) [ Angoulême is in the road from Poitiers to Bordeaux;

      iii. p. 41, 42,) and Rorico, (l. iv. in tom. iii. p. 14-19.)]

      After the success of the Gothic war, Clovis accepted the honors
      of the Roman consulship. The emperor Anastasius ambitiously
      bestowed on the most powerful rival of Theodoric the title and
      ensigns of that eminent dignity; yet, from some unknown cause,
      the name of Clovis has not been inscribed in the Fasti either of
      the East or West. 57 On the solemn day, the monarch of Gaul,
      placing a diadem on his head, was invested, in the church of St.
      Martin, with a purple tunic and mantle. From thence he proceeded
      on horseback to the cathedral of Tours; and, as he passed through
      the streets, profusely scattered, with his own hand, a donative
      of gold and silver to the joyful multitude, who incessantly
      repeated their acclamations of Consul and Augustus. The actual or
      legal authority of Clovis could not receive any new accessions
      from the consular dignity. It was a name, a shadow, an empty
      pageant; and if the conqueror had been instructed to claim the
      ancient prerogatives of that high office, they must have expired
      with the period of its annual duration. But the Romans were
      disposed to revere, in the person of their master, that antique
      title which the emperors condescended to assume: the Barbarian
      himself seemed to contract a sacred obligation to respect the
      majesty of the republic; and the successors of Theodosius, by
      soliciting his friendship, tacitly forgave, and almost ratified,
      the usurpation of Gaul.

      57 (return) [ The Fasti of Italy would naturally reject a consul,
      the enemy of their sovereign; but any ingenious hypothesis that
      might explain the silence of Constantinople and Egypt, (the
      Chronicle of Marcellinus, and the Paschal,) is overturned by the
      similar silence of Marius, bishop of Avenche, who composed his
      Fasti in the kingdom of Burgundy. If the evidence of Gregory of
      Tours were less weighty and positive, (l. ii. c. 38, in tom. ii.
      p. 183,) I could believe that Clovis, like Odoacer, received the
      lasting title and honors of Patrician, (Pagi Critica, tom. ii. p.
      474, 492.)]

      Twenty-five years after the death of Clovis this important
      concession was more formally declared, in a treaty between his
      sons and the emperor Justinian. The Ostrogoths of Italy, unable
      to defend their distant acquisitions, had resigned to the Franks
      the cities of Arles and Marseilles; of Arles, still adorned with
      the seat of a Prætorian præfect, and of Marseilles, enriched by
      the advantages of trade and navigation. 58 This transaction was
      confirmed by the Imperial authority; and Justinian, generously
      yielding to the Franks the sovereignty of the countries beyond
      the Alps, which they already possessed, absolved the provincials
      from their allegiance; and established on a more lawful, though
      not more solid, foundation, the throne of the Merovingians. 59
      From that era they enjoyed the right of celebrating at Arles the
      games of the circus; and by a singular privilege, which was
      denied even to the Persian monarch, the gold coin, impressed with
      their name and image, obtained a legal currency in the empire. 60
      A Greek historian of that age has praised the private and public
      virtues of the Franks, with a partial enthusiasm, which cannot be
      sufficiently justified by their domestic annals. 61 He celebrates
      their politeness and urbanity, their regular government, and
      orthodox religion; and boldly asserts, that these Barbarians
      could be distinguished only by their dress and language from the
      subjects of Rome. Perhaps the Franks already displayed the social
      disposition, and lively graces, which, in every age, have
      disguised their vices, and sometimes concealed their intrinsic
      merit. Perhaps Agathias, and the Greeks, were dazzled by the
      rapid progress of their arms, and the splendor of their empire.
      Since the conquest of Burgundy, Gaul, except the Gothic province
      of Septimania, was subject, in its whole extent, to the sons of
      Clovis. They had extinguished the German kingdom of Thuringia,
      and their vague dominion penetrated beyond the Rhine, into the
      heart of their native forests. The Alemanni, and Bavarians, who
      had occupied the Roman provinces of Rhaetia and Noricum, to the
      south of the Danube, confessed themselves the humble vassals of
      the Franks; and the feeble barrier of the Alps was incapable of
      resisting their ambition. When the last survivor of the sons of
      Clovis united the inheritance and conquests of the Merovingians,
      his kingdom extended far beyond the limits of modern France. Yet
      modern France, such has been the progress of arts and policy, far
      surpasses, in wealth, populousness, and power, the spacious but
      savage realms of Clotaire or Dagobert. 62

      ten shillings will be a sufficient valuation of their solidus of
      gold. It was the common standard of the Barbaric fines, and
      contained forty denarii, or silver three pences. Twelve of these
      denarii made a solidus, or shilling, the twentieth part of the
      ponderal and numeral livre, or pound of silver, which has been so
      strangely reduced in modern France. See La Blanc, Traite

      The Franks, or French, are the only people of Europe who can
      deduce a perpetual succession from the conquerors of the Western
      empire. But their conquest of Gaul was followed by ten centuries
      of anarchy and ignorance. On the revival of learning, the
      students, who had been formed in the schools of Athens and Rome,
      disdained their Barbarian ancestors; and a long period elapsed
      before patient labor could provide the requisite materials to
      satisfy, or rather to excite, the curiosity of more enlightened
      times. 63 At length the eye of criticism and philosophy was
      directed to the antiquities of France; but even philosophers have
      been tainted by the contagion of prejudice and passion. The most
      extreme and exclusive systems, of the personal servitude of the
      Gauls, or of their voluntary and equal alliance with the Franks,
      have been rashly conceived, and obstinately defended; and the
      intemperate disputants have accused each other of conspiring
      against the prerogative of the crown, the dignity of the nobles,
      or the freedom of the people. Yet the sharp conflict has usefully
      exercised the adverse powers of learning and genius; and each
      antagonist, alternately vanquished and victorious has extirpated
      some ancient errors, and established some interesting truths. An
      impartial stranger, instructed by their discoveries, their
      disputes, and even their faults, may describe, from the same
      original materials, the state of the Roman provincials, after
      Gaul had submitted to the arms and laws of the Merovingian kings.

      of Gregory of Tours, and all the monuments of the Merovingian
      race, appear in a pure and perfect state, in the first four
      volumes of the Historians of France.]

      64 (return) [ In the space of [about] thirty years (1728-1765)
      this interesting subject has been agitated by the free spirit of
      the count de Boulainvilliers, (Mémoires Historiques sur l’Etat de
      la France, particularly tom. i. p. 15-49;) the learned ingenuity
      of the Abbe Dubos, (Histoire Critique de l’Etablissement de la
      Monarchie Francoise dans les Gaules, 2 vols. in 4to;) the
      comprehensive genius of the president de Montesquieu, (Esprit des
      Loix, particularly l. xxviii. xxx. xxxi.;) and the good sense and
      diligence of the Abbe de Mably, (Observations sur l’Histoire de
      France, 2 vols. 12mo.)]

      The rudest, or the most servile, condition of human society, is
      regulated, however, by some fixed and general rules. When Tacitus
      surveyed the primitive simplicity of the Germans, he discovered
      some permanent maxims, or customs, of public and private life,
      which were preserved by faithful tradition till the introduction
      of the art of writing, and of the Latin tongue. 65 Before the
      election of the Merovingian kings, the most powerful tribe, or
      nation, of the Franks, appointed four venerable chieftains to
      compose the Salic laws; 66 and their labors were examined and
      approved in three successive assemblies of the people. After the
      baptism of Clovis, he reformed several articles that appeared
      incompatible with Christianity: the Salic law was again amended
      by his sons; and at length, under the reign of Dagobert, the code
      was revised and promulgated in its actual form, one hundred years
      after the establishment of the French monarchy. Within the same
      period, the customs of the Ripuarians were transcribed and
      published; and Charlemagne himself, the legislator of his age and
      country, had accurately studied the two national laws, which
      still prevailed among the Franks. 67 The same care was extended
      to their vassals; and the rude institutions of the Alemanni and
      Bavarians were diligently compiled and ratified by the supreme
      authority of the Merovingian kings. The Visigoths and
      Burgundians, whose conquests in Gaul preceded those of the
      Franks, showed less impatience to attain one of the principal
      benefits of civilized society. Euric was the first of the Gothic
      princes who expressed, in writing, the manners and customs of his
      people; and the composition of the Burgundian laws was a measure
      of policy rather than of justice; to alleviate the yoke, and
      regain the affections, of their Gallic subjects. 68 Thus, by a
      singular coincidence, the Germans framed their artless
      institutions, at a time when the elaborate system of Roman
      jurisprudence was finally consummated. In the Salic laws, and the
      Pandects of Justinian, we may compare the first rudiments, and
      the full maturity, of civil wisdom; and whatever prejudices may
      be suggested in favor of Barbarism, our calmer reflections will
      ascribe to the Romans the superior advantages, not only of
      science and reason, but of humanity and justice. Yet the laws 681
      of the Barbarians were adapted to their wants and desires, their
      occupations and their capacity; and they all contributed to
      preserve the peace, and promote the improvement, of the society
      for whose use they were originally established. The Merovingians,
      instead of imposing a uniform rule of conduct on their various
      subjects, permitted each people, and each family, of their
      empire, freely to enjoy their domestic institutions; 69 nor were
      the Romans excluded from the common benefits of this legal
      toleration. 70 The children embraced the law of their parents,
      the wife that of her husband, the freedman that of his patron;
      and in all causes where the parties were of different nations,
      the plaintiff or accuser was obliged to follow the tribunal of
      the defendant, who may always plead a judicial presumption of
      right, or innocence. A more ample latitude was allowed, if every
      citizen, in the presence of the judge, might declare the law
      under which he desired to live, and the national society to which
      he chose to belong. Such an indulgence would abolish the partial
      distinctions of victory: and the Roman provincials might
      patiently acquiesce in the hardships of their condition; since it
      depended on themselves to assume the privilege, if they dared to
      assert the character, of free and warlike Barbarians. 71

      jurisprudence.]

      the four legislators; and many provinces, Franconia, Saxony,
      Hanover, Brabant, &c., have claimed them as their own. See an

      two copies of the Salic law has been contested with great
      learning and ingenuity. The work of M. Wiarda, History and
      Explanation of the Salic Law, Bremen, 1808, asserts that what is
      called the Lex Antiqua, or Vetustior in which many German words
      are mingled with the Latin, has no claim to superior antiquity,
      and may be suspected to be more modern. M. Wiarda has been
      opposed by M. Fuer bach, who maintains the higher age of the
      “ancient” Code, which has been greatly corrupted by the
      transcribers. See Guizot, Cours de l’Histoire Moderne, vol. i.

      Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.—Part III.

      When justice inexorably requires the death of a murderer, each
      private citizen is fortified by the assurance, that the laws, the
      magistrate, and the whole community, are the guardians of his
      personal safety. But in the loose society of the Germans, revenge
      was always honorable, and often meritorious: the independent
      warrior chastised, or vindicated, with his own hand, the injuries
      which he had offered or received; and he had only to dread the
      resentment of the sons and kinsmen of the enemy, whom he had
      sacrificed to his selfish or angry passions. The magistrate,
      conscious of his weakness, interposed, not to punish, but to
      reconcile; and he was satisfied if he could persuade or compel
      the contending parties to pay and to accept the moderate fine
      which had been ascertained as the price of blood. 72 The fierce
      spirit of the Franks would have opposed a more rigorous sentence;
      the same fierceness despised these ineffectual restraints; and,
      when their simple manners had been corrupted by the wealth of
      Gaul, the public peace was continually violated by acts of hasty
      or deliberate guilt. In every just government the same penalty is
      inflicted, or at least is imposed, for the murder of a peasant or
      a prince. But the national inequality established by the Franks,
      in their criminal proceedings, was the last insult and abuse of
      conquest. 73 In the calm moments of legislation, they solemnly
      pronounced, that the life of a Roman was of smaller value than
      that of a Barbarian. The Antrustion, 74 a name expressive of the
      most illustrious birth or dignity among the Franks, was
      appreciated at the sum of six hundred pieces of gold; while the
      noble provincial, who was admitted to the king’s table, might be
      legally murdered at the expense of three hundred pieces.

      Two hundred were deemed sufficient for a Frank of ordinary
      condition; but the meaner Romans were exposed to disgrace and
      danger by a trifling compensation of one hundred, or even fifty,
      pieces of gold. Had these laws been regulated by any principle of
      equity or reason, the public protection should have supplied, in
      just proportion, the want of personal strength. But the
      legislator had weighed in the scale, not of justice, but of
      policy, the loss of a soldier against that of a slave: the head
      of an insolent and rapacious Barbarian was guarded by a heavy
      fine; and the slightest aid was afforded to the most defenceless
      subjects. Time insensibly abated the pride of the conquerors and
      the patience of the vanquished; and the boldest citizen was
      taught, by experience, that he might suffer more injuries than he
      could inflict. As the manners of the Franks became less
      ferocious, their laws were rendered more severe; and the
      Merovingian kings attempted to imitate the impartial rigor of the
      Visigoths and Burgundians. 75 Under the empire of Charlemagne,
      murder was universally punished with death; and the use of
      capital punishments has been liberally multiplied in the
      jurisprudence of modern Europe. 76

      72 (return) [ In the heroic times of Greece, the guilt of murder
      was expiated by a pecuniary satisfaction to the family of the
      deceased, (Feithius Antiquitat. Homeric. l. ii. c. 8.)
      Heineccius, in his preface to the Elements of Germanic Law,
      favorably suggests, that at Rome and Athens homicide was only
      punished with exile. It is true: but exile was a capital
      punishment for a citizen of Rome or Athens.]

      73 (return) [ This proportion is fixed by the Salic (tit. xliv.
      in tom. iv. p. 147) and the Ripuarian (tit. vii. xi. xxxvi. in
      tom. iv. p. 237, 241) laws: but the latter does not distinguish
      any difference of Romans. Yet the orders of the clergy are placed
      above the Franks themselves, and the Burgundians and Alemanni
      between the Franks and the Romans.]

      74 (return) [ The Antrustiones, qui in truste Dominica sunt,
      leudi, fideles, undoubtedly represent the first order of Franks;
      but it is a question whether their rank was personal or
      hereditary. The Abbe de Mably (tom. i. p. 334-347) is not
      displeased to mortify the pride of birth (Esprit, l. xxx. c. 25)
      by dating the origin of the French nobility from the reign
      Clotaire II. (A.D. 615.)]

      evidently of Austrasia, (in tom. iv. p. 112.) Their premature
      severity was sometimes rash, and excessive. Childebert condemned
      not only murderers but robbers; quomodo sine lege involavit, sine
      lege moriatur; and even the negligent judge was involved in the
      same sentence. The Visigoths abandoned an unsuccessful surgeon to
      the family of his deceased patient, ut quod de eo facere
      voluerint habeant potestatem, (l. xi. tit. i. in tom. iv. p.
      435.)]

      Heineccius, the Elementa Juris Germanici, l. ii. p. 2, No. 261,

      for murder have been traced in Germany as late as the sixteenth
      century.]

      The civil and military professions, which had been separated by
      Constantine, were again united by the Barbarians. The harsh sound
      of the Teutonic appellations was mollified into the Latin titles
      of Duke, of Count, or of Praefect; and the same officer assumed,
      within his district, the command of the troops, and the
      administration of justice. 77 But the fierce and illiterate
      chieftain was seldom qualified to discharge the duties of a
      judge, which required all the faculties of a philosophic mind,
      laboriously cultivated by experience and study; and his rude
      ignorance was compelled to embrace some simple, and visible,
      methods of ascertaining the cause of justice. In every religion,
      the Deity has been invoked to confirm the truth, or to punish the
      falsehood of human testimony; but this powerful instrument was
      misapplied and abused by the simplicity of the German
      legislators. The party accused might justify his innocence, by
      producing before their tribunal a number of friendly witnesses,
      who solemnly declared their belief, or assurance, that he was not
      guilty. According to the weight of the charge, this legal number
      of compurgators was multiplied; seventy-two voices were required
      to absolve an incendiary or assassin: and when the chastity of a
      queen of France was suspected, three hundred gallant nobles
      swore, without hesitation, that the infant prince had been
      actually begotten by her deceased husband. 78 The sin and scandal
      of manifest and frequent perjuries engaged the magistrates to
      remove these dangerous temptations; and to supply the defects of
      human testimony by the famous experiments of fire and water.
      These extraordinary trials were so capriciously contrived, that,
      in some cases, guilt, and innocence in others, could not be
      proved without the interposition of a miracle. Such miracles were
      really provided by fraud and credulity; the most intricate causes
      were determined by this easy and infallible method, and the
      turbulent Barbarians, who might have disdained the sentence of
      the magistrate, submissively acquiesced in the judgment of God.

      77 (return) [ The whole subject of the Germanic judges, and their
      jurisdiction, is copiously treated by Heineccius, (Element. Jur.
      Germ. l. iii. No. 1-72.) I cannot find any proof that, under the
      Merovingian race, the scabini, or assessors, were chosen by the
      people. * Note: The question of the scabini is treated at
      considerable length by Savigny. He questions the existence of the
      scabini anterior to Charlemagne. Before this time the decision
      was by an open court of the freemen, the boni Romische Recht,

      the Salic law did not admit these negative proofs so universally
      established in the Barbaric codes. Yet this obscure concubine
      (Fredegundis,) who became the wife of the grandson of Clovis,
      must have followed the Salic law.]

      79 (return) [ Muratori, in the Antiquities of Italy, has given
      two Dissertations (xxxvii. xxxix.) on the judgments of God. It
      was expected that fire would not burn the innocent; and that the
      pure element of water would not allow the guilty to sink into its
      bosom.]

      But the trials by single combat gradually obtained superior
      credit and authority, among a warlike people, who could not
      believe that a brave man deserved to suffer, or that a coward
      deserved to live. 80 Both in civil and criminal proceedings, the
      plaintiff, or accuser, the defendant, or even the witness, were
      exposed to mortal challenge from the antagonist who was destitute
      of legal proofs; and it was incumbent on them either to desert
      their cause, or publicly to maintain their honor, in the lists of
      battle. They fought either on foot, or on horseback, according to
      the custom of their nation; 81 and the decision of the sword, or
      lance, was ratified by the sanction of Heaven, of the judge, and
      of the people. This sanguinary law was introduced into Gaul by
      the Burgundians; and their legislator Gundobald 82 condescended
      to answer the complaints and objections of his subject Avitus.
      “Is it not true,” said the king of Burgundy to the bishop, “that
      the event of national wars, and private combats, is directed by
      the judgment of God; and that his providence awards the victory
      to the juster cause?” By such prevailing arguments, the absurd
      and cruel practice of judicial duels, which had been peculiar to
      some tribes of Germany, was propagated and established in all the
      monarchies of Europe, from Sicily to the Baltic. At the end of
      ten centuries, the reign of legal violence was not totally
      extinguished; and the ineffectual censures of saints, of popes,
      and of synods, may seem to prove, that the influence of
      superstition is weakened by its unnatural alliance with reason
      and humanity. The tribunals were stained with the blood, perhaps,
      of innocent and respectable citizens; the law, which now favors
      the rich, then yielded to the strong; and the old, the feeble,
      and the infirm, were condemned, either to renounce their fairest
      claims and possessions, to sustain the dangers of an unequal
      conflict, 83 or to trust the doubtful aid of a mercenary
      champion. This oppressive jurisprudence was imposed on the
      provincials of Gaul, who complained of any injuries in their
      persons and property. Whatever might be the strength, or courage,
      of individuals, the victorious Barbarians excelled in the love
      and exercise of arms; and the vanquished Roman was unjustly
      summoned to repeat, in his own person, the bloody contest which
      had been already decided against his country. 84

      strange institution from the age of Gundobald to that of St.
      Lewis; and the philosopher is some times lost in the legal
      antiquarian.]

      to countenance the assertion) that it was not allowed by the
      Salic law. Yet the same custom, at least in case of treason, is
      mentioned by Ermoldus, Nigellus (l. iii. 543, in tom. vi. p. 48,)
      and the anonymous biographer of Lewis the Pious, (c. 46, in tom.

      their tribes.]

      A devouring host of one hundred and twenty thousand Germans had
      formerly passed the Rhine under the command of Ariovistus. One
      third part of the fertile lands of the Sequani was appropriated
      to their use; and the conqueror soon repeated his oppressive
      demand of another third, for the accommodation of a new colony of
      twenty-four thousand Barbarians, whom he had invited to share the
      rich harvest of Gaul. 85 At the distance of five hundred years,
      the Visigoths and Burgundians, who revenged the defeat of
      Ariovistus, usurped the same unequal proportion of two thirds of
      the subject lands. But this distribution, instead of spreading
      over the province, may be reasonably confined to the peculiar
      districts where the victorious people had been planted by their
      own choice, or by the policy of their leader. In these districts,
      each Barbarian was connected by the ties of hospitality with some
      Roman provincial. To this unwelcome guest, the proprietor was
      compelled to abandon two thirds of his patrimony, but the German,
      a shepherd and a hunter, might sometimes content himself with a
      spacious range of wood and pasture, and resign the smallest,
      though most valuable, portion, to the toil of the industrious
      husbandman. 86 The silence of ancient and authentic testimony has
      encouraged an opinion, that the rapine of the Franks was not
      moderated, or disguised, by the forms of a legal division; that
      they dispersed themselves over the provinces of Gaul, without
      order or control; and that each victorious robber, according to
      his wants, his avarice, and his strength, measured with his sword
      the extent of his new inheritance. At a distance from their
      sovereign, the Barbarians might indeed be tempted to exercise
      such arbitrary depredation; but the firm and artful policy of
      Clovis must curb a licentious spirit, which would aggravate the
      misery of the vanquished, whilst it corrupted the union and
      discipline of the conquerors. 861 The memorable vase of Soissons
      is a monument and a pledge of the regular distribution of the
      Gallic spoils. It was the duty and the interest of Clovis to
      provide rewards for a successful army, settlements for a numerous
      people; without inflicting any wanton or superfluous injuries on
      the loyal Catholics of Gaul. The ample fund, which he might
      lawfully acquire, of the Imperial patrimony, vacant lands, and
      Gothic usurpations, would diminish the cruel necessity of seizure
      and confiscation, and the humble provincials would more patiently
      acquiesce in the equal and regular distribution of their loss. 87

      explained by the president Montesquieu, (Esprit des Loix, l. xxx.
      c. 7, 8, 9.) I shall only add, that among the Goths, the division
      seems to have been ascertained by the judgment of the
      neighborhood, that the Barbarians frequently usurped the
      remaining third; and that the Romans might recover their right,
      unless they were barred by a prescription of fifty years.]

      861 (return) [ Sismondi (Hist des Francais, vol. i. p. 197)
      observes, they were not a conquering people, who had emigrated
      with their families, like the Goths or Burgundians. The women,
      the children, the old, had not followed Clovis: they remained in
      their ancient possessions on the Waal and the Rhine. The
      adventurers alone had formed the invading force, and they always
      considered themselves as an army, not as a colony. Hence their
      laws retained no traces of the partition of the Roman properties.
      It is curious to observe the recoil from the national vanity of
      the French historians of the last century. M. Sismondi compares
      the position of the Franks with regard to the conquered people
      with that of the Dey of Algiers and his corsair troops to the
      peaceful inhabitants of that province: M. Thierry (Lettres sur
      l’Histoire de France, p. 117) with that of the Turks towards the
      Raias or Phanariotes, the mass of the Greeks.—M.]

      supposition of arbitrary and private rapine. The Count de
      Boulainvilliers (Etat de la France, tom. i. p. 22, 23) shows a
      strong understanding through a cloud of ignorance and prejudice.
      Note: Sismondi supposes that the Barbarians, if a farm were
      conveniently situated, would show no great respect for the laws
      of property; but in general there would have been vacant land
      enough for the lots assigned to old or worn-out warriors, (Hist.
      des Francais, vol. i. p. 196.)—M.]

      The wealth of the Merovingian princes consisted in their
      extensive domain. After the conquest of Gaul, they still
      delighted in the rustic simplicity of their ancestors; the cities
      were abandoned to solitude and decay; and their coins, their
      charters, and their synods, are still inscribed with the names of
      the villas, or rural palaces, in which they successively resided.

      One hundred and sixty of these palaces, a title which need not
      excite any unseasonable ideas of art or luxury, were scattered
      through the provinces of their kingdom; and if some might claim
      the honors of a fortress, the far greater part could be esteemed
      only in the light of profitable farms. The mansion of the
      long-haired kings was surrounded with convenient yards and
      stables, for the cattle and the poultry; the garden was planted
      with useful vegetables; the various trades, the labors of
      agriculture, and even the arts of hunting and fishing, were
      exercised by servile hands for the emolument of the sovereign;
      his magazines were filled with corn and wine, either for sale or
      consumption; and the whole administration was conducted by the
      strictest maxims of private economy. 88 This ample patrimony was
      appropriated to supply the hospitable plenty of Clovis and his
      successors; and to reward the fidelity of their brave companions
      who, both in peace and war, were devoted to their personal
      service. Instead of a horse, or a suit of armor, each companion,
      according to his rank, or merit, or favor, was invested with a
      benefice, the primitive name, and most simple form, of the feudal
      possessions. These gifts might be resumed at the pleasure of the
      sovereign; and his feeble prerogative derived some support from
      the influence of his liberality. 881 But this dependent tenure
      was gradually abolished 89 by the independent and rapacious
      nobles of France, who established the perpetual property, and
      hereditary succession, of their benefices; a revolution salutary
      to the earth, which had been injured, or neglected, by its
      precarious masters. 90 Besides these royal and beneficiary
      estates, a large proportion had been assigned, in the division of
      Gaul, of allodial and Salic lands: they were exempt from tribute,

      In the bloody discord and silent decay of the Merovingian line, a
      new order of tyrants arose in the provinces, who, under the
      appellation of Seniors, or Lords, usurped a right to govern, and
      a license to oppress, the subjects of their peculiar territory.
      Their ambition might be checked by the hostile resistance of an
      equal: but the laws were extinguished; and the sacrilegious
      Barbarians, who dared to provoke the vengeance of a saint or
      bishop, 92 would seldom respect the landmarks of a profane and
      defenceless neighbor. The common or public rights of nature, such
      as they had always been deemed by the Roman jurisprudence, 93
      were severely restrained by the German conquerors, whose
      amusement, or rather passion, was the exercise of hunting. The
      vague dominion which Man has assumed over the wild inhabitants of
      the earth, the air, and the waters, was confined to some
      fortunate individuals of the human species. Gaul was again
      overspread with woods; and the animals, who were reserved for the
      use or pleasure of the lord, might ravage with impunity the
      fields of his industrious vassals. The chase was the sacred
      privilege of the nobles and their domestic servants. Plebeian
      transgressors were legally chastised with stripes and
      imprisonment; 94 but in an age which admitted a slight
      composition for the life of a citizen, it was a capital crime to
      destroy a stag or a wild bull within the precincts of the royal
      forests. 95

      According to the maxims of ancient war, the conqueror became the
      lawful master of the enemy whom he had subdued and spared: 96 and
      the fruitful cause of personal slavery, which had been almost
      suppressed by the peaceful sovereignty of Rome, was again revived
      and multiplied by the perpetual hostilities of the independent
      Barbarians. The Goth, the Burgundian, or the Frank, who returned
      from a successful expedition, dragged after him a long train of
      sheep, of oxen, and of human captives, whom he treated with the
      same brutal contempt. The youths of an elegant form and an
      ingenuous aspect were set apart for the domestic service; a
      doubtful situation, which alternately exposed them to the
      favorable or cruel impulse of passion. The useful mechanics and
      servants (smiths, carpenters, tailors, shoemakers, cooks,
      gardeners, dyers, and workmen in gold and silver, &c.) employed
      their skill for the use, or profit, of their master. But the
      Roman captives, who were destitute of art, but capable of labor,
      were condemned, without regard to their former rank, to tend the
      cattle and cultivate the lands of the Barbarians. The number of
      the hereditary bondsmen, who were attached to the Gallic estates,
      was continually increased by new supplies; and the servile
      people, according to the situation and temper of their lords, was
      sometimes raised by precarious indulgence, and more frequently
      depressed by capricious despotism. 97 An absolute power of life
      and death was exercised by these lords; and when they married
      their daughters, a train of useful servants, chained on the
      wagons to prevent their escape, was sent as a nuptial present
      into a distant country. 98 The majesty of the Roman laws
      protected the liberty of each citizen, against the rash effects
      of his own distress or despair. But the subjects of the
      Merovingian kings might alienate their personal freedom; and this
      act of legal suicide, which was familiarly practised, is
      expressed in terms most disgraceful and afflicting to the dignity
      of human nature. 99 The example of the poor, who purchased life
      by the sacrifice of all that can render life desirable, was
      gradually imitated by the feeble and the devout, who, in times of
      public disorder, pusillanimously crowded to shelter themselves
      under the battlements of a powerful chief, and around the shrine
      of a popular saint. Their submission was accepted by these
      temporal or spiritual patrons; and the hasty transaction
      irrecoverably fixed their own condition, and that of their latest
      posterity. From the reign of Clovis, during five successive
      centuries, the laws and manners of Gaul uniformly tended to
      promote the increase, and to confirm the duration, of personal
      servitude. Time and violence almost obliterated the intermediate
      ranks of society; and left an obscure and narrow interval between
      the noble and the slave. This arbitrary and recent division has
      been transformed by pride and prejudice into a national
      distinction, universally established by the arms and the laws of
      the Merovingians. The nobles, who claimed their genuine or
      fabulous descent from the independent and victorious Franks, have
      asserted and abused the indefeasible right of conquest over a
      prostrate crowd of slaves and plebeians, to whom they imputed the
      imaginary disgrace of Gallic or Roman extraction.

      The general state and revolutions of France, a name which was
      imposed by the conquerors, may be illustrated by the particular
      example of a province, a diocese, or a senatorial family.
      Auvergne had formerly maintained a just preeminence among the
      independent states and cities of Gaul. The brave and numerous
      inhabitants displayed a singular trophy; the sword of Caesar
      himself, which he had lost when he was repulsed before the walls
      of Gergovia. 100 As the common offspring of Troy, they claimed a
      fraternal alliance with the Romans; 101 and if each province had
      imitated the courage and loyalty of Auvergne, the fall of the
      Western empire might have been prevented or delayed. They firmly
      maintained the fidelity which they had reluctantly sworn to the
      Visigoths, out when their bravest nobles had fallen in the battle
      of Poitiers, they accepted, without resistance, a victorious and
      Catholic sovereign. This easy and valuable conquest was achieved
      and possessed by Theodoric, the eldest son of Clovis: but the
      remote province was separated from his Austrasian dominions, by
      the intermediate kingdoms of Soissons, Paris, and Orleans, which
      formed, after their father’s death, the inheritance of his three
      brothers. The king of Paris, Childebert, was tempted by the
      neighborhood and beauty of Auvergne. 102 The Upper country, which
      rises towards the south into the mountains of the Cevennes,
      presented a rich and various prospect of woods and pastures; the
      sides of the hills were clothed with vines; and each eminence was
      crowned with a villa or castle. In the Lower Auvergne, the River
      Allier flows through the fair and spacious plain of Limagne; and
      the inexhaustible fertility of the soil supplied, and still
      supplies, without any interval of repose, the constant repetition
      of the same harvests. 103 On the false report, that their lawful
      sovereign had been slain in Germany, the city and diocese of
      Auvergne were betrayed by the grandson of Sidonius Apollinaris.
      Childebert enjoyed this clandestine victory; and the free
      subjects of Theodoric threatened to desert his standard, if he
      indulged his private resentment, while the nation was engaged in
      the Burgundian war. But the Franks of Austrasia soon yielded to
      the persuasive eloquence of their king. “Follow me,” said
      Theodoric, “into Auvergne; I will lead you into a province, where
      you may acquire gold, silver, slaves, cattle, and precious
      apparel, to the full extent of your wishes. I repeat my promise;
      I give you the people and their wealth as your prey; and you may
      transport them at pleasure into your own country.” By the
      execution of this promise, Theodoric justly forfeited the
      allegiance of a people whom he devoted to destruction. His
      troops, reenforced by the fiercest Barbarians of Germany, 104
      spread desolation over the fruitful face of Auvergne; and two
      places only, a strong castle and a holy shrine, were saved or
      redeemed from their licentious fury. The castle of Meroliac 105
      was seated on a lofty rock, which rose a hundred feet above the
      surface of the plain; and a large reservoir of fresh water was
      enclosed, with some arable lands, within the circle of its
      fortifications. The Franks beheld with envy and despair this
      impregnable fortress; but they surprised a party of fifty
      stragglers; and, as they were oppressed by the number of their
      captives, they fixed, at a trifling ransom, the alternative of
      life or death for these wretched victims, whom the cruel
      Barbarians were prepared to massacre on the refusal of the
      garrison. Another detachment penetrated as far as Brivas, or
      Brioude, where the inhabitants, with their valuable effects, had
      taken refuge in the sanctuary of St. Julian. The doors of the
      church resisted the assault; but a daring soldier entered through
      a window of the choir, and opened a passage to his companions.
      The clergy and people, the sacred and the profane spoils, were
      rudely torn from the altar; and the sacrilegious division was
      made at a small distance from the town of Brioude. But this act
      of impiety was severely chastised by the devout son of Clovis. He
      punished with death the most atrocious offenders; left their
      secret accomplices to the vengeance of St. Julian; released the
      captives; restored the plunder; and extended the rights of
      sanctuary five miles round the sepulchre of the holy martyr. 106

      Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.—Part IV.

      Before the Austrasian army retreated from Auvergne, Theodoric
      exacted some pledges of the future loyalty of a people, whose
      just hatred could be restrained only by their fear. A select band
      of noble youths, the sons of the principal senators, was
      delivered to the conqueror, as the hostages of the faith of
      Childebert, and of their countrymen. On the first rumor of war,
      or conspiracy, these guiltless youths were reduced to a state of
      servitude; and one of them, Attalus, 107 whose adventures are
      more particularly related, kept his master’s horses in the
      diocese of Treves. After a painful search, he was discovered, in
      this unworthy occupation, by the emissaries of his grandfather,
      Gregory bishop of Langres; but his offers of ransom were sternly
      rejected by the avarice of the Barbarian, who required an
      exorbitant sum of ten pounds of gold for the freedom of his noble
      captive. His deliverance was effected by the hardy stratagem of
      Leo, a slave belonging to the kitchens of the bishop of Langres.
      108 An unknown agent easily introduced him into the same family.
      The Barbarian purchased Leo for the price of twelve pieces of
      gold; and was pleased to learn that he was deeply skilled in the
      luxury of an episcopal table: “Next Sunday,” said the Frank, “I
      shall invite my neighbors and kinsmen. Exert thy art, and force
      them to confess, that they have never seen, or tasted, such an
      entertainment, even in the king’s house.” Leo assured him, that
      if he would provide a sufficient quantity of poultry, his wishes
      should be satisfied. The master who already aspired to the merit
      of elegant hospitality, assumed, as his own, the praise which the
      voracious guests unanimously bestowed on his cook; and the
      dexterous Leo insensibly acquired the trust and management of his
      household. After the patient expectation of a whole year, he
      cautiously whispered his design to Attalus, and exhorted him to
      prepare for flight in the ensuing night. At the hour of midnight,
      the intemperate guests retired from the table; and the Frank’s
      son-in-law, whom Leo attended to his apartment with a nocturnal
      potation, condescended to jest on the facility with which he
      might betray his trust. The intrepid slave, after sustaining this
      dangerous raillery, entered his master’s bedchamber; removed his
      spear and shield; silently drew the fleetest horses from the
      stable; unbarred the ponderous gates; and excited Attalus to save
      his life and liberty by incessant diligence. Their apprehensions
      urged them to leave their horses on the banks of the Meuse; 109
      they swam the river, wandered three days in the adjacent forest,
      and subsisted only by the accidental discovery of a wild
      plum-tree. As they lay concealed in a dark thicket, they heard
      the noise of horses; they were terrified by the angry countenance
      of their master, and they anxiously listened to his declaration,
      that, if he could seize the guilty fugitives, one of them he
      would cut in pieces with his sword, and would expose the other on
      a gibbet. A length, Attalus and his faithful Leo reached the
      friendly habitation of a presbyter of Rheims, who recruited their
      fainting strength with bread and wine, concealed them from the
      search of their enemy, and safely conducted them beyond the
      limits of the Austrasian kingdom, to the episcopal palace of
      Langres. Gregory embraced his grandson with tears of joy,
      gratefully delivered Leo, with his whole family, from the yoke of
      servitude, and bestowed on him the property of a farm, where he
      might end his days in happiness and freedom. Perhaps this
      singular adventure, which is marked with so many circumstances of
      truth and nature, was related by Attalus himself, to his cousin
      or nephew, the first historian of the Franks. Gregory of Tours
      110 was born about sixty years after the death of Sidonius
      Apollinaris; and their situation was almost similar, since each
      of them was a native of Auvergne, a senator, and a bishop. The
      difference of their style and sentiments may, therefore, express
      the decay of Gaul; and clearly ascertain how much, in so short a
      space, the human mind had lost of its energy and refinement. 111

      107 (return) [ The story of Attalus is related by Gregory of
      Tours, (l. iii. c. 16, tom. ii. p. 193-195.) His editor, the P.

      year 532, with a friend of Silonius of the same name, who was
      count of Autun, fifty or sixty years before. Such an error, which
      cannot be imputed to ignorance, is excused, in some degree, by
      its own magnitude.]

      of Langres. According to the poet Fortunatus, he displayed equal
      merit in these different stations. Nobilis antiqua decurrens

      fully verifies by his own work. His style is equally devoid of
      elegance and simplicity. In a conspicuous station, he still
      remained a stranger to his own age and country; and in a prolific
      work (the five last books contain ten years) he has omitted

      artful, misrepresentations, which have softened, or exaggerated,
      the oppression of the Romans of Gaul under the reign of the
      Merovingians. The conquerors never promulgated any universal
      edict of servitude, or confiscation; but a degenerate people, who
      excused their weakness by the specious names of politeness and
      peace, was exposed to the arms and laws of the ferocious
      Barbarians, who contemptuously insulted their possessions, their
      freedom, and their safety. Their personal injuries were partial
      and irregular; but the great body of the Romans survived the
      revolution, and still preserved the property, and privileges, of
      citizens. A large portion of their lands was exacted for the use
      of the Franks: but they enjoyed the remainder, exempt from
      tribute; 112 and the same irresistible violence which swept away
      the arts and manufactures of Gaul, destroyed the elaborate and
      expensive system of Imperial despotism. The Provincials must
      frequently deplore the savage jurisprudence of the Salic or
      Ripuarian laws; but their private life, in the important concerns
      of marriage, testaments, or inheritance, was still regulated by
      the Theodosian Code; and a discontented Roman might freely
      aspire, or descend, to the title and character of a Barbarian.
      The honors of the state were accessible to his ambition: the
      education and temper of the Romans more peculiarly qualified them
      for the offices of civil government; and, as soon as emulation
      had rekindled their military ardor, they were permitted to march
      in the ranks, or even at the head, of the victorious Germans. I
      shall not attempt to enumerate the generals and magistrates,
      whose names 113 attest the liberal policy of the Merovingians.
      The supreme command of Burgundy, with the title of Patrician, was
      successively intrusted to three Romans; and the last, and most
      powerful, Mummolus, 114 who alternately saved and disturbed the
      monarchy, had supplanted his father in the station of count of
      Autun, and left a treasury of thirty talents of gold, and two
      hundred and fifty talents of silver. The fierce and illiterate
      Barbarians were excluded, during several generations, from the
      dignities, and even from the orders, of the church. 115 The
      clergy of Gaul consisted almost entirely of native provincials;
      the haughty Franks fell at the feet of their subjects, who were
      dignified with the episcopal character: and the power and riches
      which had been lost in war, were insensibly recovered by
      superstition. 116 In all temporal affairs, the Theodosian Code
      was the universal law of the clergy; but the Barbaric
      jurisprudence had liberally provided for their personal safety; a
      sub-deacon was equivalent to two Franks; the antrustion, and
      priest, were held in similar estimation: and the life of a bishop
      was appreciated far above the common standard, at the price of
      nine hundred pieces of gold. 117 The Romans communicated to their
      conquerors the use of the Christian religion and Latin language;
      118 but their language and their religion had alike degenerated
      from the simple purity of the Augustan, and Apostolic age. The
      progress of superstition and Barbarism was rapid and universal:
      the worship of the saints concealed from vulgar eyes the God of
      the Christians; and the rustic dialect of peasants and soldiers
      was corrupted by a Teutonic idiom and pronunciation. Yet such
      intercourse of sacred and social communion eradicated the
      distinctions of birth and victory; and the nations of Gaul were
      gradually confounded under the name and government of the Franks.

      polished into the actual form of the French language. Under the
      Carlovingian race, the kings and nobles of France still
      understood the dialect of their German ancestors.]

      The Franks, after they mingled with their Gallic subjects, might
      have imparted the most valuable of human gifts, a spirit and
      system of constitutional liberty. Under a king, hereditary, but
      limited, the chiefs and counsellors might have debated at Paris,
      in the palace of the Caesars: the adjacent field, where the
      emperors reviewed their mercenary legions, would have admitted
      the legislative assembly of freemen and warriors; and the rude
      model, which had been sketched in the woods of Germany, 119 might
      have been polished and improved by the civil wisdom of the
      Romans. But the careless Barbarians, secure of their personal
      independence, disdained the labor of government: the annual
      assemblies of the month of March were silently abolished; and the
      nation was separated, and almost dissolved, by the conquest of
      Gaul. 120 The monarchy was left without any regular establishment
      of justice, of arms, or of revenue. The successors of Clovis
      wanted resolution to assume, or strength to exercise, the
      legislative and executive powers, which the people had abdicated:
      the royal prerogative was distinguished only by a more ample
      privilege of rapine and murder; and the love of freedom, so often
      invigorated and disgraced by private ambition, was reduced, among
      the licentious Franks, to the contempt of order, and the desire
      of impunity. Seventy-five years after the death of Clovis, his
      grandson, Gontran, king of Burgundy, sent an army to invade the
      Gothic possessions of Septimania, or Languedoc. The troops of
      Burgundy, Berry, Auvergne, and the adjacent territories, were
      excited by the hopes of spoil. They marched, without discipline,
      under the banners of German, or Gallic, counts: their attack was
      feeble and unsuccessful; but the friendly and hostile provinces
      were desolated with indiscriminate rage. The cornfields, the
      villages, the churches themselves, were consumed by fire: the
      inhabitants were massacred, or dragged into captivity; and, in
      the disorderly retreat, five thousand of these inhuman savages
      were destroyed by hunger or intestine discord. When the pious
      Gontran reproached the guilt or neglect of their leaders, and
      threatened to inflict, not a legal sentence, but instant and
      arbitrary execution, they accused the universal and incurable
      corruption of the people. “No one,” they said, “any longer fears
      or respects his king, his duke, or his count. Each man loves to
      do evil, and freely indulges his criminal inclinations. The most
      gentle correction provokes an immediate tumult, and the rash
      magistrate, who presumes to censure or restrain his seditious
      subjects, seldom escapes alive from their revenge.” 121 It has
      been reserved for the same nation to expose, by their intemperate
      vices, the most odious abuse of freedom; and to supply its loss
      by the spirit of honor and humanity, which now alleviates and
      dignifies their obedience to an absolute sovereign. 1211

      The Visigoths had resigned to Clovis the greatest part of their
      Gallic possessions; but their loss was amply compensated by the
      easy conquest, and secure enjoyment, of the provinces of Spain.
      From the monarchy of the Goths, which soon involved the Suevic
      kingdom of Gallicia, the modern Spaniards still derive some
      national vanity; but the historian of the Roman empire is neither
      invited, nor compelled, to pursue the obscure and barren series
      of their annals. 122 The Goths of Spain were separated from the
      rest of mankind by the lofty ridge of the Pyrenaean mountains:
      their manners and institutions, as far as they were common to the
      Germanic tribes, have been already explained. I have anticipated,
      in the preceding chapter, the most important of their
      ecclesiastical events, the fall of Arianism, and the persecution
      of the Jews; and it only remains to observe some interesting
      circumstances which relate to the civil and ecclesiastical
      constitution of the Spanish kingdom.

      122 (return) [ Spain, in these dark ages, has been peculiarly
      unfortunate. The Franks had a Gregory of Tours; the Saxons, or
      Angles, a Bede; the Lombards, a Paul Warnefrid, &c. But the
      history of the Visigoths is contained in the short and imperfect
      Chronicles of Isidore of Seville and John of Biclar]

      After their conversion from idolatry or heresy, the Frank and the
      Visigoths were disposed to embrace, with equal submission, the
      inherent evils and the accidental benefits, of superstition. But
      the prelates of France, long before the extinction of the
      Merovingian race, had degenerated into fighting and hunting
      Barbarians. They disdained the use of synods; forgot the laws of
      temperance and chastity; and preferred the indulgence of private
      ambition and luxury to the general interest of the sacerdotal
      profession. 123 The bishops of Spain respected themselves, and
      were respected by the public: their indissoluble union disguised
      their vices, and confirmed their authority; and the regular
      discipline of the church introduced peace, order, and stability,
      into the government of the state. From the reign of Recared, the
      first Catholic king, to that of Witiza, the immediate predecessor
      of the unfortunate Roderic, sixteen national councils were
      successively convened. The six metropolitans, Toledo, Seville,
      Merida, Braga, Tarragona, and Narbonne, presided according to
      their respective seniority; the assembly was composed of their
      suffragan bishops, who appeared in person, or by their proxies;
      and a place was assigned to the most holy, or opulent, of the
      Spanish abbots. During the first three days of the convocation,
      as long as they agitated the ecclesiastical question of doctrine
      and discipline, the profane laity was excluded from their
      debates; which were conducted, however, with decent solemnity.
      But, on the morning of the fourth day, the doors were thrown open
      for the entrance of the great officers of the palace, the dukes
      and counts of the provinces, the judges of the cities, and the
      Gothic nobles, and the decrees of Heaven were ratified by the
      consent of the people.

      The same rules were observed in the provincial assemblies, the
      annual synods, which were empowered to hear complaints, and to
      redress grievances; and a legal government was supported by the
      prevailing influence of the Spanish clergy. The bishops, who, in
      each revolution, were prepared to flatter the victorious, and to
      insult the prostrate labored, with diligence and success, to
      kindle the flames of persecution, and to exalt the mitre above
      the crown. Yet the national councils of Toledo, in which the free
      spirit of the Barbarians was tempered and guided by episcopal
      policy, have established some prudent laws for the common benefit
      of the king and people. The vacancy of the throne was supplied by
      the choice of the bishops and palatines; and after the failure of
      the line of Alaric, the regal dignity was still limited to the
      pure and noble blood of the Goths. The clergy, who anointed their
      lawful prince, always recommended, and sometimes practised, the
      duty of allegiance; and the spiritual censures were denounced on
      the heads of the impious subjects, who should resist his
      authority, conspire against his life, or violate, by an indecent
      union, the chastity even of his widow. But the monarch himself,
      when he ascended the throne, was bound by a reciprocal oath to
      God and his people, that he would faithfully execute this
      important trust. The real or imaginary faults of his
      administration were subject to the control of a powerful
      aristocracy; and the bishops and palatines were guarded by a
      fundamental privilege, that they should not be degraded,
      imprisoned, tortured, nor punished with death, exile, or
      confiscation, unless by the free and public judgment of their
      peers. 124

      123 (return) [ Such are the complaints of St. Boniface, the
      apostle of Germany, and the reformer of Gaul, (in tom. iv. p.
      94.) The fourscore years, which he deplores, of license and
      corruption, would seem to insinuate that the Barbarians were
      admitted into the clergy about the year 660.]

      124 (return) [ The acts of the councils of Toledo are still the
      most authentic records of the church and constitution of Spain.
      The following passages are particularly important, (iii. 17, 18;
      iv. 75; v. 2, 3, 4, 5, 8; vi. 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18; vii. 1;
      xiii. 2 3 6.) I have found Mascou (Hist. of the Ancient Germans,
      xv. 29, and Annotations, xxvi. and xxxiii.) and Ferreras (Hist.
      Generale de l’Espagne, tom. ii.) very useful and accurate
      guides.]

      One of these legislative councils of Toledo examined and ratified
      the code of laws which had been compiled by a succession of
      Gothic kings, from the fierce Euric, to the devout Egica. As long
      as the Visigoths themselves were satisfied with the rude customs
      of their ancestors, they indulged their subjects of Aquitain and
      Spain in the enjoyment of the Roman law. Their gradual
      improvement in arts, in policy, and at length in religion,
      encouraged them to imitate, and to supersede, these foreign
      institutions; and to compose a code of civil and criminal
      jurisprudence, for the use of a great and united people. The same
      obligations, and the same privileges, were communicated to the
      nations of the Spanish monarchy; and the conquerors, insensibly
      renouncing the Teutonic idiom, submitted to the restraints of
      equity, and exalted the Romans to the participation of freedom.
      The merit of this impartial policy was enhanced by the situation
      of Spain under the reign of the Visigoths. The provincials were
      long separated from their Arian masters by the irreconcilable
      difference of religion. After the conversion of Recared had
      removed the prejudices of the Catholics, the coasts, both of the
      Ocean and Mediterranean, were still possessed by the Eastern
      emperors; who secretly excited a discontented people to reject
      the yoke of the Barbarians, and to assert the name and dignity of
      Roman citizens. The allegiance of doubtful subjects is indeed
      most effectually secured by their own persuasion, that they
      hazard more in a revolt, than they can hope to obtain by a
      revolution; but it has appeared so natural to oppress those whom
      we hate and fear, that the contrary system well deserves the
      praise of wisdom and moderation. 125

      125 (return) [ The Code of the Visigoths, regularly divided into
      twelve books, has been correctly published by Dom Bouquet, (in
      tom. iv. p. 273-460.) It has been treated by the President de
      Montesquieu (Esprit des Loix, l. xxviii. c. 1) with excessive
      severity. I dislike the style; I detest the superstition; but I
      shall presume to think, that the civil jurisprudence displays a
      more civilized and enlightened state of society, than that of the
      Burgundians, or even of the Lombards.]

      While the kingdom of the Franks and Visigoths were established in
      Gaul and Spain, the Saxons achieved the conquest of Britain, the
      third great diocese of the Praefecture of the West. Since Britain
      was already separated from the Roman empire, I might, without
      reproach, decline a story familiar to the most illiterate, and
      obscure to the most learned, of my readers. The Saxons, who
      excelled in the use of the oar, or the battle-axe, were ignorant
      of the art which could alone perpetuate the fame of their
      exploits; the Provincials, relapsing into barbarism, neglected to
      describe the ruin of their country; and the doubtful tradition
      was almost extinguished, before the missionaries of Rome restored
      the light of science and Christianity. The declamations of
      Gildas, the fragments, or fables, of Nennius, the obscure hints
      of the Saxon laws and chronicles, and the ecclesiastical tales of
      the venerable Bede, 126 have been illustrated by the diligence,
      and sometimes embellished by the fancy, of succeeding writers,
      whose works I am not ambitious either to censure or to
      transcribe. 127 Yet the historian of the empire may be tempted to
      pursue the revolutions of a Roman province, till it vanishes from
      his sight; and an Englishman may curiously trace the
      establishment of the Barbarians, from whom he derives his name,
      his laws, and perhaps his origin.

      history of England. * Note: Add the Anglo-Saxon History of Mr. S.

      About forty years after the dissolution of the Roman government,
      Vortigern appears to have obtained the supreme, though precarious
      command of the princes and cities of Britain. That unfortunate
      monarch has been almost unanimously condemned for the weak and
      mischievous policy of inviting 128 a formidable stranger, to
      repel the vexatious inroads of a domestic foe. His ambassadors
      are despatched, by the gravest historians, to the coast of
      Germany: they address a pathetic oration to the general assembly
      of the Saxons, and those warlike Barbarians resolve to assist
      with a fleet and army the suppliants of a distant and unknown
      island. If Britain had indeed been unknown to the Saxons, the
      measure of its calamities would have been less complete. But the
      strength of the Roman government could not always guard the
      maritime province against the pirates of Germany; the independent
      and divided states were exposed to their attacks; and the Saxons
      might sometimes join the Scots and the Picts, in a tacit, or
      express, confederacy of rapine and destruction. Vortigern could
      only balance the various perils, which assaulted on every side
      his throne and his people; and his policy may deserve either
      praise or excuse, if he preferred the alliance of those
      Barbarians, whose naval power rendered them the most dangerous
      enemies and the most serviceable allies. Hengist and Horsa, as
      they ranged along the Eastern coast with three ships, were
      engaged, by the promise of an ample stipend, to embrace the
      defence of Britain; and their intrepid valor soon delivered the
      country from the Caledonian invaders. The Isle of Thanet, a
      secure and fertile district, was allotted for the residence of
      these German auxiliaries, and they were supplied, according to
      the treaty, with a plentiful allowance of clothing and
      provisions. This favorable reception encouraged five thousand
      warriors to embark with their families in seventeen vessels, and
      the infant power of Hengist was fortified by this strong and
      seasonable reenforcement. The crafty Barbarian suggested to
      Vortigern the obvious advantage of fixing, in the neighborhood of
      the Picts, a colony of faithful allies: a third fleet of forty
      ships, under the command of his son and nephew, sailed from
      Germany, ravaged the Orkneys, and disembarked a new army on the
      coast of Northumberland, or Lothian, at the opposite extremity of
      the devoted land. It was easy to foresee, but it was impossible
      to prevent, the impending evils. The two nations were soon
      divided and exasperated by mutual jealousies. The Saxons
      magnified all that they had done and suffered in the cause of an
      ungrateful people; while the Britons regretted the liberal
      rewards which could not satisfy the avarice of those haughty
      mercenaries. The causes of fear and hatred were inflamed into an
      irreconcilable quarrel. The Saxons flew to arms; and if they
      perpetrated a treacherous massacre during the security of a
      feast, they destroyed the reciprocal confidence which sustains
      the intercourse of peace and war. 129

      128 (return) [ This invitation, which may derive some countenance
      from the loose expressions of Gildas and Bede, is framed into a
      regular story by Witikind, a Saxon monk of the tenth century,
      (see Cousin, Hist. de l’Empire d’Occident, tom. ii. p. 356.)
      Rapin, and even Hume, have too freely used this suspicious
      evidence, without regarding the precise and probable testimony of
      Tennius: Iterea venerunt tres Chinlae a exilio pulsoe, in quibus

      which the giants had formerly transported from Africa to Ireland,
      and which was removed to Britain by the order of Ambrosius, and
      the art of Merlin. * Note: Sir f. Palgrave (Hist. of England, p.

      appeared, in early youth, so essentially poetic, as to justify
      the rash attempt to embody them in an Epic Poem, called Samor,
      commenced at Eton, and finished before he had arrived at the
      maturer taste of manhood.—M.]

      Hengist, who boldly aspired to the conquest of Britain, exhorted
      his countrymen to embrace the glorious opportunity: he painted in
      lively colors the fertility of the soil, the wealth of the
      cities, the pusillanimous temper of the natives, and the
      convenient situation of a spacious solitary island, accessible on
      all sides to the Saxon fleets. The successive colonies which
      issued, in the period of a century, from the mouths of the Elbe,
      the Weser, and the Rhine, were principally composed of three
      valiant tribes or nations of Germany; the Jutes, the old Saxons,
      and the Angles. The Jutes, who fought under the peculiar banner
      of Hengist, assumed the merit of leading their countrymen in the
      paths of glory, and of erecting, in Kent, the first independent
      kingdom. The fame of the enterprise was attributed to the
      primitive Saxons; and the common laws and language of the
      conquerors are described by the national appellation of a people,
      which, at the end of four hundred years, produced the first
      monarchs of South Britain. The Angles were distinguished by their
      numbers and their success; and they claimed the honor of fixing a
      perpetual name on the country, of which they occupied the most
      ample portion. The Barbarians, who followed the hopes of rapine
      either on the land or sea, were insensibly blended with this
      triple confederacy; the Frisians, who had been tempted by their
      vicinity to the British shores, might balance, during a short
      space, the strength and reputation of the native Saxons; the
      Danes, the Prussians, the Rugians, are faintly described; and
      some adventurous Huns, who had wandered as far as the Baltic,
      might embark on board the German vessels, for the conquest of a
      new world. 130 But this arduous achievement was not prepared or
      executed by the union of national powers. Each intrepid
      chieftain, according to the measure of his fame and fortunes,
      assembled his followers; equipped a fleet of three, or perhaps of
      sixty, vessels; chose the place of the attack; and conducted his
      subsequent operations according to the events of the war, and the
      dictates of his private interest. In the invasion of Britain many
      heroes vanquished and fell; but only seven victorious leaders
      assumed, or at least maintained, the title of kings. Seven
      independent thrones, the Saxon Heptarchy, 1301 were founded by
      the conquerors, and seven families, one of which has been
      continued, by female succession, to our present sovereign,
      derived their equal and sacred lineage from Woden, the god of
      war. It has been pretended, that this republic of kings was
      moderated by a general council and a supreme magistrate. But such
      an artificial scheme of policy is repugnant to the rude and
      turbulent spirit of the Saxons: their laws are silent; and their
      imperfect annals afford only a dark and bloody prospect of
      intestine discord. 131

      an indefinite supremacy of power and renown. But their reign was
      the effect, not of law, but of conquest; and he observes, in
      similar terms, that one of them subdued the Isles of Man and
      Anglesey; and that another imposed a tribute on the Scots and
      Picts. (Hist. Eccles. l. ii. c. 5, p. 83.)]

      A monk, who, in the profound ignorance of human life, has
      presumed to exercise the office of historian, strangely
      disfigures the state of Britain at the time of its separation
      from the Western empire. Gildas 132 describes in florid language
      the improvements of agriculture, the foreign trade which flowed
      with every tide into the Thames and the Severn the solid and
      lofty construction of public and private edifices; he accuses the
      sinful luxury of the British people; of a people, according to
      the same writer, ignorant of the most simple arts, and incapable,
      without the aid of the Romans, of providing walls of stone, or
      weapons of iron, for the defence of their native land. 133 Under
      the long dominion of the emperors, Britain had been insensibly
      moulded into the elegant and servile form of a Roman province,
      whose safety was intrusted to a foreign power. The subjects of
      Honorius contemplated their new freedom with surprise and terror;
      they were left destitute of any civil or military constitution;
      and their uncertain rulers wanted either skill, or courage, or
      authority, to direct the public force against the common enemy.
      The introduction of the Saxons betrayed their internal weakness,
      and degraded the character both of the prince and people. Their
      consternation magnified the danger; the want of union diminished
      their resources; and the madness of civil factions was more
      solicitous to accuse, than to remedy, the evils, which they
      imputed to the misconduct of their adversaries.

      Yet the Britons were not ignorant, they could not be ignorant, of
      the manufacture or the use of arms; the successive and disorderly
      attacks of the Saxons allowed them to recover from their
      amazement, and the prosperous or adverse events of the war added
      discipline and experience to their native valor.

      133 (return) [ Mr. Whitaker (Hist. of Manchester, vol. ii. p.
      503, 516) has smartly exposed this glaring absurdity, which had
      passed unnoticed by the general historians, as they were
      hastening to more interesting and important events]

      While the continent of Europe and Africa yielded, without
      resistance, to the Barbarians, the British island, alone and
      unaided, maintained a long, a vigorous, though an unsuccessful,
      struggle, against the formidable pirates, who, almost at the same
      instant, assaulted the Northern, the Eastern, and the Southern
      coasts. The cities which had been fortified with skill, were
      defended with resolution; the advantages of ground, hills,
      forests, and morasses, were diligently improved by the
      inhabitants; the conquest of each district was purchased with
      blood; and the defeats of the Saxons are strongly attested by the
      discreet silence of their annalist. Hengist might hope to achieve
      the conquest of Britain; but his ambition, in an active reign of
      thirty-five years, was confined to the possession of Kent; and
      the numerous colony which he had planted in the North, was
      extirpated by the sword of the Britons. The monarchy of the West
      Saxons was laboriously founded by the persevering efforts of
      three martial generations. The life of Cerdic, one of the bravest
      of the children of Woden, was consumed in the conquest of
      Hampshire, and the Isle of Wight; and the loss which he sustained
      in the battle of Mount Badon, reduced him to a state of
      inglorious repose. Kenric, his valiant son, advanced into
      Wiltshire; besieged Salisbury, at that time seated on a
      commanding eminence; and vanquished an army which advanced to the
      relief of the city. In the subsequent battle of Marlborough, 134
      his British enemies displayed their military science. Their
      troops were formed in three lines; each line consisted of three
      distinct bodies, and the cavalry, the archers, and the pikemen,
      were distributed according to the principles of Roman tactics.
      The Saxons charged in one weighty column, boldly encountered with
      their shord swords the long lances of the Britons, and maintained
      an equal conflict till the approach of night. Two decisive
      victories, the death of three British kings, and the reduction of
      Cirencester, Bath, and Gloucester, established the fame and power
      of Ceaulin, the grandson of Cerdic, who carried his victorious
      arms to the banks of the Severn.

      134 (return) [ At Beran-birig, or Barbury-castle, near
      Marlborough. The Saxon chronicle assigns the name and date.
      Camden (Britannia, vol. i. p. 128) ascertains the place; and
      Henry of Huntingdon (Scriptores pest Bedam, p. 314) relates the
      circumstances of this battle. They are probable and
      characteristic; and the historians of the twelfth century might
      consult some materials that no longer exist.] After a war of a
      hundred years, the independent Britons still occupied the whole
      extent of the Western coast, from the wall of Antoninus to the
      extreme promontory of Cornwall; and the principal cities of the
      inland country still opposed the arms of the Barbarians.
      Resistance became more languid, as the number and boldness of the
      assailants continually increased. Winning their way by slow and
      painful efforts, the Saxons, the Angles, and their various
      confederates, advanced from the North, from the East, and from
      the South, till their victorious banners were united in the
      centre of the island. Beyond the Severn the Britons still
      asserted their national freedom, which survived the heptarchy,
      and even the monarchy, of the Saxons. The bravest warriors, who
      preferred exile to slavery, found a secure refuge in the
      mountains of Wales: the reluctant submission of Cornwall was
      delayed for some ages; 135 and a band of fugitives acquired a
      settlement in Gaul, by their own valor, or the liberality of the
      Merovingian kings. 136 The Western angle of Armorica acquired the
      new appellations of Cornwall, and the Lesser Britain; and the
      vacant lands of the Osismii were filled by a strange people, who,
      under the authority of their counts and bishops, preserved the
      laws and language of their ancestors. To the feeble descendants
      of Clovis and Charlemagne, the Britons of Armorica refused the
      customary tribute, subdued the neighboring dioceses of Vannes,
      Rennes, and Nantes, and formed a powerful, though vassal, state,
      which has been united to the crown of France. 137

      135 (return) [ Cornwall was finally subdued by Athelstan, (A.D.

      ii., in the Scriptores post Bedam, p. 50. The spirit of the
      Cornish knights was degraded by servitude: and it should seem,
      from the Romance of Sir Tristram, that their cowardice was almost

      the Britons to the first council of Tours, (A.D. 461, or rather
      481,) the army of Riothamus, and the loose declamation of Gildas,
      (alii transmarinas petebant regiones, c. 25, p. 8,) may
      countenance an emigration as early as the middle of the fifth
      century. Beyond that era, the Britons of Armorica can be found
      only in romance; and I am surprised that Mr. Whitaker (Genuine
      History of the Britons, p. 214-221) should so faithfully
      transcribe the gross ignorance of Carte, whose venial errors he
      has so rigorously chastised.]

      took refuge in their country, and that the greater part landed as
      fugitives rather than as conquerors. I observe that M. Lappenberg
      (Geschichte von England, vol. i. p. 56) supposes the settlement
      of a military colony formed of British soldiers, (Milites
      limitanei, laeti,) during the usurpation of Maximus, (381, 388,)
      who gave their name and peculiar civilization to Bretagne. M.

      authority which he follows elsewhere.—M.]




      Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.—Part V.

      In a century of perpetual, or at least implacable, war, much
      courage, and some skill, must have been exerted for the defence
      of Britain. Yet if the memory of its champions is almost buried
      in oblivion, we need not repine; since every age, however
      destitute of science or virtue, sufficiently abounds with acts of
      blood and military renown. The tomb of Vortimer, the son of
      Vortigern, was erected on the margin of the sea-shore, as a
      landmark formidable to the Saxons, whom he had thrice vanquished
      in the fields of Kent. Ambrosius Aurelian was descended from a
      noble family of Romans; 138 his modesty was equal to his valor,
      and his valor, till the last fatal action, 139 was crowned with
      splendid success. But every British name is effaced by the
      illustrious name of Arthur, 140 the hereditary prince of the
      Silures, in South Wales, and the elective king or general of the
      nation. According to the most rational account, he defeated, in
      twelve successive battles, the Angles of the North, and the
      Saxons of the West; but the declining age of the hero was
      imbittered by popular ingratitude and domestic misfortunes. The
      events of his life are less interesting than the singular
      revolutions of his fame. During a period of five hundred years
      the tradition of his exploits was preserved, and rudely
      embellished, by the obscure bards of Wales and Armorica, who were
      odious to the Saxons, and unknown to the rest of mankind. The
      pride and curiosity of the Norman conquerors prompted them to
      inquire into the ancient history of Britain: they listened with
      fond credulity to the tale of Arthur, and eagerly applauded the
      merit of a prince who had triumphed over the Saxons, their common
      enemies. His romance, transcribed in the Latin of Jeffrey of
      Monmouth, and afterwards translated into the fashionable idiom of
      the times, was enriched with the various, though incoherent,
      ornaments which were familiar to the experience, the learning, or
      the fancy, of the twelfth century. The progress of a Phrygian
      colony, from the Tyber to the Thames, was easily ingrafted on the
      fable of the Aeneid; and the royal ancestors of Arthur derived
      their origin from Troy, and claimed their alliance with the
      Caesars. His trophies were decorated with captive provinces and
      Imperial titles; and his Danish victories avenged the recent
      injuries of his country. The gallantry and superstition of the
      British hero, his feasts and tournaments, and the memorable
      institution of his Knights of the Round Table, were faithfully
      copied from the reigning manners of chivalry; and the fabulous
      exploits of Uther’s son appear less incredible than the
      adventures which were achieved by the enterprising valor of the
      Normans. Pilgrimage, and the holy wars, introduced into Europe
      the specious miracles of Arabian magic. Fairies and giants,
      flying dragons, and enchanted palaces, were blended with the more
      simple fictions of the West; and the fate of Britain depended on
      the art, or the predictions, of Merlin. Every nation embraced and
      adorned the popular romance of Arthur, and the Knights of the
      Round Table: their names were celebrated in Greece and Italy; and
      the voluminous tales of Sir Lancelot and Sir Tristram were
      devoutly studied by the princes and nobles, who disregarded the
      genuine heroes and historians of antiquity. At length the light
      of science and reason was rekindled; the talisman was broken; the
      visionary fabric melted into air; and by a natural, though
      unjust, reverse of the public opinion, the severity of the
      present age is inclined to question the existence of Arthur. 141

      138 (return) [ Bede, who in his chronicle (p. 28) places
      Ambrosius under the reign of Zeno, (A.D. 474-491,) observes, that
      his parents had been “purpura induti;” which he explains, in his
      ecclesiastical history, by “regium nomen et insigne ferentibus,”
      (l. i. c. 16, p. 53.) The expression of Nennius (c. 44, p. 110,
      edit. Gale) is still more singular, “Unus de consulibus gentis
      Romanicae est pater meus.”]

      139 (return) [ By the unanimous, though doubtful, conjecture of
      our antiquarians, Ambrosius is confounded with Natanleod, who
      (A.D. 508) lost his own life, and five thousand of his subjects,
      in a battle against Cerdic, the West Saxon, (Chron. Saxon. p. 17,
      18.)]

      140 (return) [ As I am a stranger to the Welsh bards, Myrdhin,
      Llomarch, and Taliessin, my faith in the existence and exploits
      of Arthur principally rests on the simple and circumstantial
      testimony of Nennius. (Hist. Brit. c. 62, 63, p. 114.) Mr.
      Whitaker, (Hist. of Manchester, vol. ii. p. 31-71) had framed an
      interesting, and even probable, narrative of the wars of Arthur:
      though it is impossible to allow the reality of the round table.
      * Note: I presume that Gibbon means Llywarch Hen, or the
      Aged.—The Elegies of this Welsh prince and bard have been
      published by Mr. Owen; to whose works and in the Myvyrian
      Archaeology, slumbers much curious information on the subject of
      Welsh tradition and poetry. But the Welsh antiquarians have never
      obtained a hearing from the public; they have had no Macpherson
      to compensate for his corruption of their poetic legends by
      forcing them into popularity.—See also Mr. Sharon Turner’s Essay
      on the Welsh Bards.—M.]

      141 (return) [ The progress of romance, and the state of
      learning, in the middle ages, are illustrated by Mr. Thomas
      Warton, with the taste of a poet, and the minute diligence of an
      antiquarian. I have derived much instruction from the two learned
      dissertations prefixed to the first volume of his History of
      English Poetry. * Note: These valuable dissertations should not
      now be read without the notes and preliminary essay of the late
      editor, Mr. Price, which, in point of taste and fulness of
      information, are worthy of accompanying and completing those of
      Warton.—M.]

      Resistance, if it cannot avert, must increase the miseries of
      conquest; and conquest has never appeared more dreadful and
      destructive than in the hands of the Saxons; who hated the valor
      of their enemies, disdained the faith of treaties, and violated,
      without remorse, the most sacred objects of the Christian
      worship. The fields of battle might be traced, almost in every
      district, by monuments of bones; the fragments of falling towers
      were stained with blood; the last of the Britons, without
      distinction of age or sex, was massacred, 142 in the ruins of
      Anderida; 143 and the repetition of such calamities was frequent
      and familiar under the Saxon heptarchy. The arts and religion,
      the laws and language, which the Romans had so carefully planted
      in Britain, were extirpated by their barbarous successors. After
      the destruction of the principal churches, the bishops, who had
      declined the crown of martyrdom, retired with the holy relics
      into Wales and Armorica; the remains of their flocks were left
      destitute of any spiritual food; the practice, and even the
      remembrance, of Christianity were abolished; and the British
      clergy might obtain some comfort from the damnation of the
      idolatrous strangers. The kings of France maintained the
      privileges of their Roman subjects; but the ferocious Saxons
      trampled on the laws of Rome, and of the emperors. The
      proceedings of civil and criminal jurisdiction, the titles of
      honor, the forms of office, the ranks of society, and even the
      domestic rights of marriage, testament, and inheritance, were
      finally suppressed; and the indiscriminate crowd of noble and
      plebeian slaves was governed by the traditionary customs, which
      had been coarsely framed for the shepherds and pirates of
      Germany. The language of science, of business, and of
      conversation, which had been introduced by the Romans, was lost
      in the general desolation. A sufficient number of Latin or Celtic
      words might be assumed by the Germans, to express their new wants
      and ideas; 144 but those illiterate Pagans preserved and
      established the use of their national dialect. 145 Almost every
      name, conspicuous either in the church or state, reveals its
      Teutonic origin; 146 and the geography of England was universally
      inscribed with foreign characters and appellations. The example
      of a revolution, so rapid and so complete, may not easily be
      found; but it will excite a probable suspicion, that the arts of
      Rome were less deeply rooted in Britain than in Gaul or Spain;
      and that the native rudeness of the country and its inhabitants
      was covered by a thin varnish of Italian manners.

      expression more dreadful in its simplicity, than all the vague
      and tedious lamentations of the British Jeremiah.]

      of the great forest (Anderida) which overspread so large a
      portion of Hampshire and Sussex.]

      British extraction. Mr. Whitaker, who understands the British
      language, has discovered more than three thousand, and actually
      produces a long and various catalogue, (vol. ii. p. 235-329.) It
      is possible, indeed, that many of these words may have been
      imported from the Latin or Saxon into the native idiom of
      Britain. * Note: Dr. Prichard’s very curious researches, which
      connect the Celtic, as well as the Teutonic languages with the
      Indo-European class, make it still more difficult to decide
      between the Celtic or Teutonic origin of English words.—See
      Prichard on the Eastern Origin of the Celtic Nations Oxford,
      1831.—M.]

      145 (return) [ In the beginning of the seventh century, the
      Franks and the Anglo-Saxons mutually understood each other’s
      language, which was derived from the same Teutonic root, (Bede,
      l. i. c. 25, p. 60.)]

      146 (return) [ After the first generation of Italian, or
      Scottish, missionaries, the dignities of the church were filled

      This strange alteration has persuaded historians, and even
      philosophers, that the provincials of Britain were totally
      exterminated; and that the vacant land was again peopled by the
      perpetual influx, and rapid increase, of the German colonies.
      Three hundred thousand Saxons are said to have obeyed the summons
      of Hengist; 147 the entire emigation of the Angles was attested,
      in the age of Bede, by the solitude of their native country; 148
      and our experience has shown the free propagation of the human
      race, if they are cast on a fruitful wilderness, where their
      steps are unconfined, and their subsistence is plentiful. The
      Saxon kingdoms displayed the face of recent discovery and
      cultivation; the towns were small, the villages were distant; the
      husbandry was languid and unskilful; four sheep were equivalent
      to an acre of the best land; 149 an ample space of wood and
      morass was resigned to the vague dominion of nature; and the
      modern bishopric of Durham, the whole territory from the Tyne to
      the Tees, had returned to its primitive state of a savage and
      solitary forest. 150 Such imperfect population might have been
      supplied, in some generations, by the English colonies; but
      neither reason nor facts can justify the unnatural supposition,
      that the Saxons of Britain remained alone in the desert which
      they had subdued. After the sanguinary Barbarians had secured
      their dominion, and gratified their revenge, it was their
      interest to preserve the peasants as well as the cattle, of the
      unresisting country. In each successive revolution, the patient
      herd becomes the property of its new masters; and the salutary
      compact of food and labor is silently ratified by their mutual
      necessities. Wilfrid, the apostle of Sussex, 151 accepted from
      his royal convert the gift of the peninsula of Selsey, near
      Chichester, with the persons and property of its inhabitants, who
      then amounted to eighty-seven families. He released them at once
      from spiritual and temporal bondage; and two hundred and fifty
      slaves of both sexes were baptized by their indulgent master. The
      kingdom of Sussex, which spread from the sea to the Thames,
      contained seven thousand families; twelve hundred were ascribed
      to the Isle of Wight; and, if we multiply this vague computation,
      it may seem probable, that England was cultivated by a million of
      servants, or villains, who were attached to the estates of their
      arbitrary landlords. The indigent Barbarians were often tempted
      to sell their children, or themselves into perpetual, and even
      foreign, bondage; 152 yet the special exemptions which were
      granted to national slaves, 153 sufficiently declare that they
      were much less numerous than the strangers and captives, who had
      lost their liberty, or changed their masters, by the accidents of
      war. When time and religion had mitigated the fierce spirit of
      the Anglo-Saxons, the laws encouraged the frequent practice of
      manumission; and their subjects, of Welsh or Cambrian extraction,
      assumed the respectable station of inferior freemen, possessed of
      lands, and entitled to the rights of civil society. 154 Such
      gentle treatment might secure the allegiance of a fierce people,
      who had been recently subdued on the confines of Wales and
      Cornwall. The sage Ina, the legislator of Wessex, united the two
      nations in the bands of domestic alliance; and four British lords
      of Somersetshire may be honorably distinguished in the court of a
      Saxon monarch. 155

      The independent Britons appear to have relapsed into the state of
      original barbarism, from whence they had been imperfectly
      reclaimed. Separated by their enemies from the rest of mankind,
      they soon became an object of scandal and abhorrence to the
      Catholic world. 156 Christianity was still professed in the
      mountains of Wales; but the rude schismatics, in the form of the
      clerical tonsure, and in the day of the celebration of Easter,
      obstinately resisted the imperious mandates of the Roman
      pontiffs. The use of the Latin language was insensibly abolished,
      and the Britons were deprived of the art and learning which Italy
      communicated to her Saxon proselytes. In Wales and Armorica, the
      Celtic tongue, the native idiom of the West, was preserved and
      propagated; and the Bards, who had been the companions of the
      Druids, were still protected, in the sixteenth century, by the
      laws of Elizabeth. Their chief, a respectable officer of the
      courts of Pengwern, or Aberfraw, or Caermarthen, accompanied the
      king’s servants to war: the monarchy of the Britons, which he
      sung in the front of battle, excited their courage, and justified
      their depredations; and the songster claimed for his legitimate
      prize the fairest heifer of the spoil. His subordinate ministers,
      the masters and disciples of vocal and instrumental music,
      visited, in their respective circuits, the royal, the noble, and
      the plebeian houses; and the public poverty, almost exhausted by
      the clergy, was oppressed by the importunate demands of the
      bards. Their rank and merit were ascertained by solemn trials,
      and the strong belief of supernatural inspiration exalted the
      fancy of the poet, and of his audience. 157 The last retreats of
      Celtic freedom, the extreme territories of Gaul and Britain, were
      less adapted to agriculture than to pasturage: the wealth of the
      Britons consisted in their flocks and herds; milk and flesh were
      their ordinary food; and bread was sometimes esteemed, or
      rejected, as a foreign luxury. Liberty had peopled the mountains
      of Wales and the morasses of Armorica; but their populousness has
      been maliciously ascribed to the loose practice of polygamy; and
      the houses of these licentious barbarians have been supposed to
      contain ten wives, and perhaps fifty children. 158 Their
      disposition was rash and choleric; they were bold in action and
      in speech; 159 and as they were ignorant of the arts of peace,
      they alternately indulged their passions in foreign and domestic
      war. The cavalry of Armorica, the spearmen of Gwent, and the
      archers of Merioneth, were equally formidable; but their poverty
      could seldom procure either shields or helmets; and the
      inconvenient weight would have retarded the speed and agility of
      their desultory operations. One of the greatest of the English
      monarchs was requested to satisfy the curiosity of a Greek
      emperor concerning the state of Britain; and Henry II. could
      assert, from his personal experience, that Wales was inhabited by
      a race of naked warriors, who encountered, without fear, the
      defensive armor of their enemies. 160

      Vertot, (Hist. Critique tom. ii. p. 259-266.)]

      By the revolution of Britain, the limits of science, as well as
      of empire, were contracted. The dark cloud, which had been
      cleared by the Phoenician discoveries, and finally dispelled by
      the arms of Caesar, again settled on the shores of the Atlantic,
      and a Roman province was again lost among the fabulous Islands of
      the Ocean. One hundred and fifty years after the reign of
      Honorius, the gravest historian of the times 161 describes the
      wonders of a remote isle, whose eastern and western parts are
      divided by an antique wall, the boundary of life and death, or,
      more properly, of truth and fiction. The east is a fair country,
      inhabited by a civilized people: the air is healthy, the waters
      are pure and plentiful, and the earth yields her regular and
      fruitful increase. In the west, beyond the wall, the air is
      infectious and mortal; the ground is covered with serpents; and
      this dreary solitude is the region of departed spirits, who are
      transported from the opposite shores in substantial boats, and by
      living rowers. Some families of fishermen, the subjects of the
      Franks, are excused from tribute, in consideration of the
      mysterious office which is performed by these Charons of the
      ocean. Each in his turn is summoned, at the hour of midnight, to
      hear the voices, and even the names, of the ghosts: he is
      sensible of their weight, and he feels himself impelled by an
      unknown, but irresistible power. After this dream of fancy, we
      read with astonishment, that the name of this island is Brittia;
      that it lies in the ocean, against the mouth of the Rhine, and
      less than thirty miles from the continent; that it is possessed
      by three nations, the Frisians, the Angles, and the Britons; and
      that some Angles had appeared at Constantinople, in the train of
      the French ambassadors. From these ambassadors Procopius might be
      informed of a singular, though not improbable, adventure, which
      announces the spirit, rather than the delicacy, of an English
      heroine. She had been betrothed to Radiger, king of the Varni, a
      tribe of Germans who touched the ocean and the Rhine; but the
      perfidious lover was tempted, by motives of policy, to prefer his
      father’s widow, the sister of Theodebert, king of the Franks. 162
      The forsaken princess of the Angles, instead of bewailing,
      revenged her disgrace. Her warlike subjects are said to have been
      ignorant of the use, and even of the form, of a horse; but she
      boldly sailed from Britain to the mouth of the Rhine, with a
      fleet of four hundred ships, and an army of one hundred thousand
      men. After the loss of a battle, the captive Radiger implored the
      mercy of his victorious bride, who generously pardoned his
      offence, dismissed her rival, and compelled the king of the Varni
      to discharge with honor and fidelity the duties of a husband. 163
      This gallant exploit appears to be the last naval enterprise of
      the Anglo-Saxons. The arts of navigation, by which they acquired
      the empire of Britain and of the sea, were soon neglected by the
      indolent Barbarians, who supinely renounced all the commercial
      advantages of their insular situation. Seven independent kingdoms
      were agitated by perpetual discord; and the British world was
      seldom connected, either in peace or war, with the nations of the
      Continent. 164

      161 (return) [ See Procopius de Bell. Gothic. l. iv. c. 20, p.
      620-625. The Greek historian is himself so confounded by the
      wonders which he relates, that he weakly attempts to distinguish
      the islands of Britia and Britain, which he has identified by so
      many inseparable circumstances.]

      162 (return) [ Theodebert, grandson of Clovis, and king of
      Austrasia, was the most powerful and warlike prince of the age;
      and this remarkable adventure may be placed between the years 534
      and 547, the extreme terms of his reign. His sister Theudechildis
      retired to Sens, where she founded monasteries, and distributed
      alms, (see the notes of the Benedictine editors, in tom. ii. p.
      216.) If we may credit the praises of Fortunatus, (l. vi. carm.
      5, in tom. ii. p. 507,) Radiger was deprived of a most valuable
      wife.]

      163 (return) [ Perhaps she was the sister of one of the princes
      or chiefs of the Angles, who landed in 527, and the following
      years, between the Humber and the Thames, and gradually founded
      the kingdoms of East Anglia and Mercia. The English writers are
      ignorant of her name and existence: but Procopius may have
      suggested to Mr. Rowe the character and situation of Rodogune in
      the tragedy of the Royal Convert.]

      164 (return) [ In the copious history of Gregory of Tours, we
      cannot find any traces of hostile or friendly intercourse between
      France and England except in the marriage of the daughter of
      Caribert, king of Paris, quam regis cujusdam in Cantia filius
      matrimonio copulavit, (l. ix. c. 28, in tom. ii. p. 348.) The
      bishop of Tours ended his history and his life almost immediately
      before the conversion of Kent.]

      I have now accomplished the laborious narrative of the decline
      and fall of the Roman empire, from the fortunate age of Trajan
      and the Antonines, to its total extinction in the West, about
      five centuries after the Christian era. At that unhappy period,
      the Saxons fiercely struggled with the natives for the possession
      of Britain: Gaul and Spain were divided between the powerful
      monarchies of the Franks and Visigoths, and the dependent
      kingdoms of the Suevi and Burgundians: Africa was exposed to the
      cruel persecution of the Vandals, and the savage insults of the
      Moors: Rome and Italy, as far as the banks of the Danube, were
      afflicted by an army of Barbarian mercenaries, whose lawless
      tyranny was succeeded by the reign of Theodoric the Ostrogoth.
      All the subjects of the empire, who, by the use of the Latin
      language, more particularly deserved the name and privileges of
      Romans, were oppressed by the disgrace and calamities of foreign
      conquest; and the victorious nations of Germany established a new
      system of manners and government in the western countries of
      Europe. The majesty of Rome was faintly represented by the
      princes of Constantinople, the feeble and imaginary successors of
      Augustus. Yet they continued to reign over the East, from the
      Danube to the Nile and Tigris; the Gothic and Vandal kingdoms of
      Italy and Africa were subverted by the arms of Justinian; and the
      history of the Greek emperors may still afford a long series of
      instructive lessons, and interesting revolutions.




      Chapter XXXVIII: Reign Of Clovis.—Part VI.

    General Observations On The Fall Of The Roman Empire In The West.

      The Greeks, after their country had been reduced into a province,
      imputed the triumphs of Rome, not to the merit, but to the
      fortune, of the republic. The inconstant goddess, who so blindly
      distributes and resumes her favors, had now consented (such was
      the language of envious flattery) to resign her wings, to descend
      from her globe, and to fix her firm and immutable throne on the
      banks of the Tyber. 1000 A wiser Greek, who has composed, with a
      philosophic spirit, the memorable history of his own times,
      deprived his countrymen of this vain and delusive comfort, by
      opening to their view the deep foundations of the greatness of
      Rome. 2000 The fidelity of the citizens to each other, and to the
      state, was confirmed by the habits of education, and the
      prejudices of religion. Honor, as well as virtue, was the
      principle of the republic; the ambitious citizens labored to
      deserve the solemn glories of a triumph; and the ardor of the
      Roman youth was kindled into active emulation, as often as they
      beheld the domestic images of their ancestors. 3000 The temperate
      struggles of the patricians and plebeians had finally established
      the firm and equal balance of the constitution; which united the
      freedom of popular assemblies, with the authority and wisdom of a
      senate, and the executive powers of a regal magistrate. When the
      consul displayed the standard of the republic, each citizen bound
      himself, by the obligation of an oath, to draw his sword in the
      cause of his country, till he had discharged the sacred duty by a
      military service of ten years. This wise institution continually
      poured into the field the rising generations of freemen and
      soldiers; and their numbers were reenforced by the warlike and
      populous states of Italy, who, after a brave resistance, had
      yielded to the valor and embraced the alliance, of the Romans.
      The sage historian, who excited the virtue of the younger Scipio,
      and beheld the ruin of Carthage, 4000 has accurately described
      their military system; their levies, arms, exercises,
      subordination, marches, encampments; and the invincible legion,
      superior in active strength to the Macedonian phalanx of Philip
      and Alexander. From these institutions of peace and war Polybius
      has deduced the spirit and success of a people, incapable of
      fear, and impatient of repose. The ambitious design of conquest,
      which might have been defeated by the seasonable conspiracy of
      mankind, was attempted and achieved; and the perpetual violation
      of justice was maintained by the political virtues of prudence
      and courage. The arms of the republic, sometimes vanquished in
      battle, always victorious in war, advanced with rapid steps to
      the Euphrates, the Danube, the Rhine, and the Ocean; and the
      images of gold, or silver, or brass, that might serve to
      represent the nations and their kings, were successively broken
      by the iron monarchy of Rome. 5000

      1000 (return) [ Such are the figurative expressions of Plutarch,
      (Opera, tom. ii. p. 318, edit. Wechel,) to whom, on the faith of
      his son Lamprias, (Fabricius, Bibliot. Graec. tom. iii. p. 341,)
      I shall boldly impute the malicious declamation. The same
      opinions had prevailed among the Greeks two hundred and fifty
      years before Plutarch; and to confute them is the professed
      intention of Polybius, (Hist. l. i. p. 90, edit. Gronov. Amstel.
      1670.)]

      2000 (return) [ See the inestimable remains of the sixth book of
      Polybius, and many other parts of his general history,

      compares the phalanx and the legion.]

      3000 (return) [ Sallust, de Bell. Jugurthin. c. 4. Such were the
      generous professions of P. Scipio and Q. Maximus. The Latin

      contemporary and friend.]

      4000 (return) [ While Carthage was in flames, Scipio repeated two
      lines of the Iliad, which express the destruction of Troy,
      acknowledging to Polybius, his friend and preceptor, (Polyb. in
      Excerpt. de Virtut. et Vit. tom. ii. p. 1455-1465,) that while he
      recollected the vicissitudes of human affairs, he inwardly
      applied them to the future calamities of Rome, (Appian. in
      Libycis, p. 136, edit. Toll.)]

      5000 (return) [ See Daniel, ii. 31-40. “And the fourth kingdom
      shall be strong as iron; forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and
      subdueth all things.” The remainder of the prophecy (the mixture
      of iron and clay) was accomplished, according to St. Jerom, in
      his own time. Sicut enim in principio nihil Romano Imperio
      fortius et durius, ita in fine rerum nihil imbecillius; quum et
      in bellis civilibus et adversus diversas nationes, aliarum
      gentium barbararum auxilio indigemus, (Opera, tom. v. p. 572.)]

      The rise of a city, which swelled into an empire, may deserve, as
      a singular prodigy, the reflection of a philosophic mind. But the
      decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of
      immoderate greatness. Prosperity ripened the principle of decay;
      the causes of destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest;
      and as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial
      supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its
      own weight. The story of its ruin is simple and obvious; and
      instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we
      should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long. The
      victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of
      strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the
      republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple. The
      emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace,
      were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline
      which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to
      the enemy; the vigor of the military government was relaxed, and
      finally dissolved, by the partial institutions of Constantine;
      and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians.

      The decay of Rome has been frequently ascribed to the translation
      of the seat of empire; but this History has already shown, that
      the powers of government were divided, rather than removed. The
      throne of Constantinople was erected in the East; while the West
      was still possessed by a series of emperors who held their
      residence in Italy, and claimed their equal inheritance of the
      legions and provinces. This dangerous novelty impaired the
      strength, and fomented the vices, of a double reign: the
      instruments of an oppressive and arbitrary system were
      multiplied; and a vain emulation of luxury, not of merit, was
      introduced and supported between the degenerate successors of
      Theodosius. Extreme distress, which unites the virtue of a free
      people, imbitters the factions of a declining monarchy. The
      hostile favorites of Arcadius and Honorius betrayed the republic
      to its common enemies; and the Byzantine court beheld with
      indifference, perhaps with pleasure, the disgrace of Rome, the
      misfortunes of Italy, and the loss of the West. Under the
      succeeding reigns, the alliance of the two empires was restored;
      but the aid of the Oriental Romans was tardy, doubtful, and
      ineffectual; and the national schism of the Greeks and Latins was
      enlarged by the perpetual difference of language and manners, of
      interests, and even of religion. Yet the salutary event approved
      in some measure the judgment of Constantine. During a long period
      of decay, his impregnable city repelled the victorious armies of
      Barbarians, protected the wealth of Asia, and commanded, both in
      peace and war, the important straits which connect the Euxine and
      Mediterranean Seas. The foundation of Constantinople more
      essentially contributed to the preservation of the East, than to
      the ruin of the West.

      As the happiness of a future life is the great object of
      religion, we may hear without surprise or scandal, that the
      introduction or at least the abuse, of Christianity had some
      influence on the decline and fall of the Roman empire. The clergy
      successfully preached the doctrines of patience and
      pusillanimity: the active virtues of society were discouraged;
      and the last remains of military spirit were buried in the
      cloister: a large portion of public and private wealth was
      consecrated to the specious demands of charity and devotion; and
      the soldiers’ pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both
      sexes, who could only plead the merits of abstinence and
      chastity. 511 Faith, zeal, curiosity, and the more earthly
      passions of malice and ambition, kindled the flame of theological
      discord; the church, and even the state, were distracted by
      religious factions, whose conflicts were sometimes bloody, and
      always implacable; the attention of the emperors was diverted
      from camps to synods; the Roman world was oppressed by a new
      species of tyranny; and the persecuted sects became the secret
      enemies of their country. Yet party spirit, however pernicious or
      absurd, is a principle of union as well as of dissension. The
      bishops, from eighteen hundred pulpits, inculcated the duty of
      passive obedience to a lawful and orthodox sovereign; their
      frequent assemblies, and perpetual correspondence, maintained the
      communion of distant churches; and the benevolent temper of the
      gospel was strengthened, though confined, by the spiritual
      alliance of the Catholics. The sacred indolence of the monks was
      devoutly embraced by a servile and effeminate age; but if
      superstition had not afforded a decent retreat, the same vices
      would have tempted the unworthy Romans to desert, from baser
      motives, the standard of the republic. Religious precepts are
      easily obeyed, which indulge and sanctify the natural
      inclinations of their votaries; but the pure and genuine
      influence of Christianity may be traced in its beneficial, though
      imperfect, effects on the Barbarian proselytes of the North. If
      the decline of the Roman empire was hastened by the conversion of
      Constantine, his victorious religion broke the violence of the
      fall, and mollified the ferocious temper of the conquerors.

      511 (return) [ It might be a curious speculation, how far the
      purer morals of the genuine and more active Christians may have
      compensated, in the population of the Roman empire, for the
      secession of such numbers into inactive and unproductive
      celibacy.—M.]

      This awful revolution may be usefully applied to the instruction
      of the present age. It is the duty of a patriot to prefer and
      promote the exclusive interest and glory of his native country:
      but a philosopher may be permitted to enlarge his views, and to
      consider Europe as one great republic whose various inhabitants
      have obtained almost the same level of politeness and
      cultivation. The balance of power will continue to fluctuate, and
      the prosperity of our own, or the neighboring kingdoms, may be
      alternately exalted or depressed; but these partial events cannot
      essentially injure our general state of happiness, the system of
      arts, and laws, and manners, which so advantageously distinguish,
      above the rest of mankind, the Europeans and their colonies. The
      savage nations of the globe are the common enemies of civilized
      society; and we may inquire, with anxious curiosity, whether
      Europe is still threatened with a repetition of those calamities,
      which formerly oppressed the arms and institutions of Rome.
      Perhaps the same reflections will illustrate the fall of that
      mighty empire, and explain the probable causes of our actual
      security.

      I. The Romans were ignorant of the extent of their danger, and
      the number of their enemies. Beyond the Rhine and Danube, the
      Northern countries of Europe and Asia were filled with
      innumerable tribes of hunters and shepherds, poor, voracious, and
      turbulent; bold in arms, and impatient to ravish the fruits of
      industry. The Barbarian world was agitated by the rapid impulse
      of war; and the peace of Gaul or Italy was shaken by the distant
      revolutions of China. The Huns, who fled before a victorious
      enemy, directed their march towards the West; and the torrent was
      swelled by the gradual accession of captives and allies. The
      flying tribes who yielded to the Huns assumed in their turn the
      spirit of conquest; the endless column of Barbarians pressed on
      the Roman empire with accumulated weight; and, if the foremost
      were destroyed, the vacant space was instantly replenished by new
      assailants. Such formidable emigrations can no longer issue from
      the North; and the long repose, which has been imputed to the
      decrease of population, is the happy consequence of the progress
      of arts and agriculture. Instead of some rude villages, thinly
      scattered among its woods and morasses, Germany now produces a
      list of two thousand three hundred walled towns: the Christian
      kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden, and Poland, have been successively
      established; and the Hanse merchants, with the Teutonic knights,
      have extended their colonies along the coast of the Baltic, as
      far as the Gulf of Finland. From the Gulf of Finland to the
      Eastern Ocean, Russia now assumes the form of a powerful and
      civilized empire. The plough, the loom, and the forge, are
      introduced on the banks of the Volga, the Oby, and the Lena; and
      the fiercest of the Tartar hordes have been taught to tremble and
      obey. The reign of independent Barbarism is now contracted to a
      narrow span; and the remnant of Calmucks or Uzbecks, whose forces
      may be almost numbered, cannot seriously excite the apprehensions
      of the great republic of Europe. 6000 Yet this apparent security
      should not tempt us to forget, that new enemies, and unknown
      dangers, may possibly arise from some obscure people, scarcely
      visible in the map of the world, The Arabs or Saracens, who
      spread their conquests from India to Spain, had languished in
      poverty and contempt, till Mahomet breathed into those savage
      bodies the soul of enthusiasm.

      6000 (return) [ The French and English editors of the
      Genealogical History of the Tartars have subjoined a curious,
      though imperfect, description, of their present state. We might
      question the independence of the Calmucks, or Eluths, since they
      have been recently vanquished by the Chinese, who, in the year
      1759, subdued the Lesser Bucharia, and advanced into the country
      of Badakshan, near the source of the Oxus, (Mémoires sur les
      Chinois, tom. i. p. 325-400.) But these conquests are precarious,
      nor will I venture to insure the safety of the Chinese empire.]

      II. The empire of Rome was firmly established by the singular and
      perfect coalition of its members. The subject nations, resigning
      the hope, and even the wish, of independence, embraced the
      character of Roman citizens; and the provinces of the West were
      reluctantly torn by the Barbarians from the bosom of their mother
      country. 7000 But this union was purchased by the loss of
      national freedom and military spirit; and the servile provinces,
      destitute of life and motion, expected their safety from the
      mercenary troops and governors, who were directed by the orders
      of a distant court. The happiness of a hundred millions depended
      on the personal merit of one or two men, perhaps children, whose
      minds were corrupted by education, luxury, and despotic power.
      The deepest wounds were inflicted on the empire during the
      minorities of the sons and grandsons of Theodosius; and, after
      those incapable princes seemed to attain the age of manhood, they
      abandoned the church to the bishops, the state to the eunuchs,
      and the provinces to the Barbarians. Europe is now divided into
      twelve powerful, though unequal kingdoms, three respectable
      commonwealths, and a variety of smaller, though independent,
      states: the chances of royal and ministerial talents are
      multiplied, at least, with the number of its rulers; and a
      Julian, or Semiramis, may reign in the North, while Arcadius and
      Honorius again slumber on the thrones of the South. The abuses of
      tyranny are restrained by the mutual influence of fear and shame;
      republics have acquired order and stability; monarchies have
      imbibed the principles of freedom, or, at least, of moderation;
      and some sense of honor and justice is introduced into the most
      defective constitutions by the general manners of the times. In
      peace, the progress of knowledge and industry is accelerated by
      the emulation of so many active rivals: in war, the European
      forces are exercised by temperate and undecisive contests. If a
      savage conqueror should issue from the deserts of Tartary, he
      must repeatedly vanquish the robust peasants of Russia, the
      numerous armies of Germany, the gallant nobles of France, and the
      intrepid freemen of Britain; who, perhaps, might confederate for
      their common defence. Should the victorious Barbarians carry
      slavery and desolation as far as the Atlantic Ocean, ten thousand
      vessels would transport beyond their pursuit the remains of
      civilized society; and Europe would revive and flourish in the
      American world, which is already filled with her colonies and
      institutions. 8000

      7000 (return) [ The prudent reader will determine how far this
      general proposition is weakened by the revolt of the Isaurians,
      the independence of Britain and Armorica, the Moorish tribes, or
      the Bagaudae of Gaul and Spain, (vol. i. p. 328, vol. iii. p.
      315, vol. iii. p. 372, 480.)]

      8000 (return) [ America now contains about six millions of
      European blood and descent; and their numbers, at least in the
      North, are continually increasing. Whatever may be the changes of
      their political situation, they must preserve the manners of
      Europe; and we may reflect with some pleasure, that the English
      language will probably be diffused ever an immense and populous
      continent.]

      III. Cold, poverty, and a life of danger and fatigue, fortify the
      strength and courage of Barbarians. In every age they have
      oppressed the polite and peaceful nations of China, India, and
      Persia, who neglected, and still neglect, to counterbalance these
      natural powers by the resources of military art. The warlike
      states of antiquity, Greece, Macedonia, and Rome, educated a race
      of soldiers; exercised their bodies, disciplined their courage,
      multiplied their forces by regular evolutions, and converted the
      iron, which they possessed, into strong and serviceable weapons.
      But this superiority insensibly declined with their laws and
      manners; and the feeble policy of Constantine and his successors
      armed and instructed, for the ruin of the empire, the rude valor
      of the Barbarian mercenaries. The military art has been changed
      by the invention of gunpowder; which enables man to command the
      two most powerful agents of nature, air and fire. Mathematics,
      chemistry, mechanics, architecture, have been applied to the
      service of war; and the adverse parties oppose to each other the
      most elaborate modes of attack and of defence. Historians may
      indignantly observe, that the preparations of a siege would found
      and maintain a flourishing colony; 9000 yet we cannot be
      displeased, that the subversion of a city should be a work of
      cost and difficulty; or that an industrious people should be
      protected by those arts, which survive and supply the decay of
      military virtue. Cannon and fortifications now form an
      impregnable barrier against the Tartar horse; and Europe is
      secure from any future irruptions of Barbarians; since, before
      they can conquer, they must cease to be barbarous. Their gradual
      advances in the science of war would always be accompanied, as we
      may learn from the example of Russia, with a proportionable
      improvement in the arts of peace and civil policy; and they
      themselves must deserve a place among the polished nations whom
      they subdue.

      9000 (return) [ On avoit fait venir (for the siege of Turin) 140
      pieces de canon; et il est a remarquer que chaque gros canon
      monte revient a environ ecus: il y avoit 100,000 boulets; 106,000
      cartouches d’une facon, et 300,000 d’une autre; 21,000 bombes;
      27,700 grenades, 15,000 sacs a terre, 30,000 instruments pour la
      pionnage; 1,200,000 livres de poudre. Ajoutez a ces munitions, le
      plomb, le fer, et le fer-blanc, les cordages, tout ce qui sert
      aux mineurs, le souphre, le salpetre, les outils de toute espece.
      Il est certain que les frais de tous ces preparatifs de
      destruction suffiroient pour fonder et pour faire fleurir la plus
      aombreuse colonie. Voltaire, Siecle de Louis XIV. c. xx. in his
      Works. tom. xi. p. 391.]

      Should these speculations be found doubtful or fallacious, there
      still remains a more humble source of comfort and hope. The
      discoveries of ancient and modern navigators, and the domestic
      history, or tradition, of the most enlightened nations, represent
      the human savage, naked both in body and mind and destitute of
      laws, of arts, of ideas, and almost of language. 1001 From this
      abject condition, perhaps the primitive and universal state of
      man, he has gradually arisen to command the animals, to fertilize
      the earth, to traverse the ocean and to measure the heavens. His
      progress in the improvement and exercise of his mental and
      corporeal faculties 1101 has been irregular and various;
      infinitely slow in the beginning, and increasing by degrees with
      redoubled velocity: ages of laborious ascent have been followed
      by a moment of rapid downfall; and the several climates of the
      globe have felt the vicissitudes of light and darkness. Yet the
      experience of four thousand years should enlarge our hopes, and
      diminish our apprehensions: we cannot determine to what height
      the human species may aspire in their advances towards
      perfection; but it may safely be presumed, that no people, unless
      the face of nature is changed, will relapse into their original
      barbarism. The improvements of society may be viewed under a
      threefold aspect. 1. The poet or philosopher illustrates his age
      and country by the efforts of a single mind; but those superior
      powers of reason or fancy are rare and spontaneous productions;
      and the genius of Homer, or Cicero, or Newton, would excite less
      admiration, if they could be created by the will of a prince, or
      the lessons of a preceptor. 2. The benefits of law and policy, of
      trade and manufactures, of arts and sciences, are more solid and
      permanent: and many individuals may be qualified, by education
      and discipline, to promote, in their respective stations, the
      interest of the community. But this general order is the effect
      of skill and labor; and the complex machinery may be decayed by
      time, or injured by violence.

      3. Fortunately for mankind, the more useful, or, at least, more
      necessary arts, can be performed without superior talents, or
      national subordination: without the powers of one, or the union
      of many. Each village, each family, each individual, must always
      possess both ability and inclination to perpetuate the use of
      fire 1201 and of metals; the propagation and service of domestic
      animals; the methods of hunting and fishing; the rudiments of
      navigation; the imperfect cultivation of corn, or other nutritive
      grain; and the simple practice of the mechanic trades. Private
      genius and public industry may be extirpated; but these hardy
      plants survive the tempest, and strike an everlasting root into
      the most unfavorable soil. The splendid days of Augustus and
      Trajan were eclipsed by a cloud of ignorance; and the Barbarians
      subverted the laws and palaces of Rome. But the scythe, the
      invention or emblem of Saturn, 1302 still continued annually to
      mow the harvests of Italy; and the human feasts of the
      Laestrigons 1401 have never been renewed on the coast of
      Campania.

      1001 (return) [ It would be an easy, though tedious, task, to
      produce the authorities of poets, philosophers, and historians. I
      shall therefore content myself with appealing to the decisive and
      authentic testimony of Diodorus Siculus, (tom. i. l. i. p. 11,
      12, l. iii. p. 184, &c., edit. Wesseling.) The Icthyophagi, who
      in his time wandered along the shores of the Red Sea, can only be
      compared to the natives of New Holland, (Dampier’s Voyages, vol.
      i. p. 464-469.) Fancy, or perhaps reason, may still suppose an
      extreme and absolute state of nature far below the level of these
      savages, who had acquired some arts and instruments.]

      human invention.]

      1201 (return) [ It is certain, however strange, that many nations
      have been ignorant of the use of fire. Even the ingenious natives
      of Otaheite, who are destitute of metals, have not invented any
      earthen vessels capable of sustaining the action of fire, and of
      communicating the heat to the liquids which they contain.]

      Since the first discovery of the arts, war, commerce, and
      religious zeal have diffused, among the savages of the Old and
      New World, these inestimable gifts: they have been successively
      propagated; they can never be lost. We may therefore acquiesce in
      the pleasing conclusion, that every age of the world has
      increased, and still increases, the real wealth, the happiness,
      the knowledge, and perhaps the virtue, of the human race. 1501

      A singular exception is due to the virtue of our own times and
      country. The five great voyages, successively undertaken by the
      command of his present Majesty, were inspired by the pure and
      generous love of science and of mankind. The same prince,
      adapting his benefactions to the different stages of society, has
      founded his school of painting in his capital; and has introduced
      into the islands of the South Sea the vegetables and animals most
      useful to human life.]
