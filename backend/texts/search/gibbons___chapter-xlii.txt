      Our estimate of personal merit, is relative to the common
      faculties of mankind. The aspiring efforts of genius, or virtue,
      either in active or speculative life, are measured, not so much
      by their real elevation, as by the height to which they ascend
      above the level of their age and country; and the same stature,
      which in a people of giants would pass unnoticed, must appear
      conspicuous in a race of pygmies. Leonidas, and his three hundred
      companions, devoted their lives at Thermopylae; but the education
      of the infant, the boy, and the man, had prepared, and almost
      insured, this memorable sacrifice; and each Spartan would
      approve, rather than admire, an act of duty, of which himself and
      eight thousand of his fellow-citizens were equally capable. 1 The
      great Pompey might inscribe on his trophies, that he had defeated
      in battle two millions of enemies, and reduced fifteen hundred
      cities from the Lake Maeotis to the Red Sea: 2 but the fortune of
      Rome flew before his eagles; the nations were oppressed by their
      own fears, and the invincible legions which he commanded, had
      been formed by the habits of conquest and the discipline of ages.
      In this view, the character of Belisarius may be deservedly
      placed above the heroes of the ancient republics. His
      imperfections flowed from the contagion of the times; his virtues
      were his own, the free gift of nature or reflection; he raised
      himself without a master or a rival; and so inadequate were the
      arms committed to his hand, that his sole advantage was derived
      from the pride and presumption of his adversaries. Under his
      command, the subjects of Justinian often deserved to be called
      Romans: but the unwarlike appellation of Greeks was imposed as a
      term of reproach by the haughty Goths; who affected to blush,
      that they must dispute the kingdom of Italy with a nation of
      tragedians pantomimes, and pirates. 3 The climate of Asia has
      indeed been found less congenial than that of Europe to military
      spirit: those populous countries were enervated by luxury,
      despotism, and superstition; and the monks were more expensive
      and more numerous than the soldiers of the East. The regular
      force of the empire had once amounted to six hundred and
      forty-five thousand men: it was reduced, in the time of
      Justinian, to one hundred and fifty thousand; and this number,
      large as it may seem, was thinly scattered over the sea and land;
      in Spain and Italy, in Africa and Egypt, on the banks of the
      Danube, the coast of the Euxine, and the frontiers of Persia. The
      citizen was exhausted, yet the soldier was unpaid; his poverty
      was mischievously soothed by the privilege of rapine and
      indolence; and the tardy payments were detained and intercepted
      by the fraud of those agents who usurp, without courage or
      danger, the emoluments of war. Public and private distress
      recruited the armies of the state; but in the field, and still
      more in the presence of the enemy, their numbers were always
      defective. The want of national spirit was supplied by the
      precarious faith and disorderly service of Barbarian mercenaries.

      Even military honor, which has often survived the loss of virtue
      and freedom, was almost totally extinct. The generals, who were
      multiplied beyond the example of former times, labored only to
      prevent the success, or to sully the reputation of their
      colleagues; and they had been taught by experience, that if merit
      sometimes provoked the jealousy, error, or even guilt, would
      obtain the indulgence, of a gracious emperor. 4 In such an age,
      the triumphs of Belisarius, and afterwards of Narses, shine with
      incomparable lustre; but they are encompassed with the darkest
      shades of disgrace and calamity. While the lieutenant of
      Justinian subdued the kingdoms of the Goths and Vandals, the
      emperor, 5 timid, though ambitious, balanced the forces of the
      Barbarians, fomented their divisions by flattery and falsehood,
      and invited by his patience and liberality the repetition of
      injuries. 6 The keys of Carthage, Rome, and Ravenna, were
      presented to their conqueror, while Antioch was destroyed by the
      Persians, and Justinian trembled for the safety of
      Constantinople.

      c. 19) imputes to the emperor, is revealed in his epistle to a
      Scythian prince, who was capable of understanding it.]

      Even the Gothic victories of Belisarius were prejudicial to the
      state, since they abolished the important barrier of the Upper
      Danube, which had been so faithfully guarded by Theodoric and his
      daughter. For the defence of Italy, the Goths evacuated Pannonia
      and Noricum, which they left in a peaceful and flourishing
      condition: the sovereignty was claimed by the emperor of the
      Romans; the actual possession was abandoned to the boldness of
      the first invader. On the opposite banks of the Danube, the
      plains of Upper Hungary and the Transylvanian hills were
      possessed, since the death of Attila, by the tribes of the
      Gepidae, who respected the Gothic arms, and despised, not indeed
      the gold of the Romans, but the secret motive of their annual
      subsidies. The vacant fortifications of the river were instantly
      occupied by these Barbarians; their standards were planted on the
      walls of Sirmium and Belgrade; and the ironical tone of their
      apology aggravated this insult on the majesty of the empire. “So
      extensive, O Caesar, are your dominions, so numerous are your
      cities, that you are continually seeking for nations to whom,
      either in peace or in war, you may relinquish these useless
      possessions. The Gepidae are your brave and faithful allies; and
      if they have anticipated your gifts, they have shown a just
      confidence in your bounty.” Their presumption was excused by the
      mode of revenge which Justinian embraced. Instead of asserting
      the rights of a sovereign for the protection of his subjects, the
      emperor invited a strange people to invade and possess the Roman
      provinces between the Danube and the Alps and the ambition of the
      Gepidae was checked by the rising power and fame of the Lombards.
      7 This corrupt appellation has been diffused in the thirteenth
      century by the merchants and bankers, the Italian posterity of
      these savage warriors: but the original name of Langobards is
      expressive only of the peculiar length and fashion of their
      beards. I am not disposed either to question or to justify their
      Scandinavian origin; 8 nor to pursue the migrations of the
      Lombards through unknown regions and marvellous adventures. About
      the time of Augustus and Trajan, a ray of historic light breaks
      on the darkness of their antiquities, and they are discovered,
      for the first time, between the Elbe and the Oder. Fierce, beyond
      the example of the Germans, they delighted to propagate the
      tremendous belief, that their heads were formed like the heads of
      dogs, and that they drank the blood of their enemies, whom they
      vanquished in battle. The smallness of their numbers was
      recruited by the adoption of their bravest slaves; and alone,
      amidst their powerful neighbors, they defended by arms their
      high-spirited independence. In the tempests of the north, which
      overwhelmed so many names and nations, this little bark of the
      Lombards still floated on the surface: they gradually descended
      towards the south and the Danube, and, at the end of four hundred
      years, they again appear with their ancient valor and renown.
      Their manners were not less ferocious. The assassination of a
      royal guest was executed in the presence, and by the command, of
      the king’s daughter, who had been provoked by some words of
      insult, and disappointed by his diminutive stature; and a
      tribute, the price of blood, was imposed on the Lombards, by his
      brother the king of the Heruli. Adversity revived a sense of
      moderation and justice, and the insolence of conquest was
      chastised by the signal defeat and irreparable dispersion of the
      Heruli, who were seated in the southern provinces of Poland. 9
      The victories of the Lombards recommended them to the friendship
      of the emperors; and at the solicitations of Justinian, they
      passed the Danube, to reduce, according to their treaty, the
      cities of Noricum and the fortresses of Pannonia. But the spirit
      of rapine soon tempted them beyond these ample limits; they
      wandered along the coast of the Hadriatic as far as Dyrrachium,
      and presumed, with familiar rudeness to enter the towns and
      houses of their Roman allies, and to seize the captives who had
      escaped from their audacious hands. These acts of hostility, the
      sallies, as it might be pretended, of some loose adventurers,
      were disowned by the nation, and excused by the emperor; but the
      arms of the Lombards were more seriously engaged by a contest of
      thirty years, which was terminated only by the extirpation of the
      Gepidae. The hostile nations often pleaded their cause before the
      throne of Constantinople; and the crafty Justinian, to whom the
      Barbarians were almost equally odious, pronounced a partial and
      ambiguous sentence, and dexterously protracted the war by slow
      and ineffectual succors. Their strength was formidable, since the
      Lombards, who sent into the field several myriads of soldiers,
      still claimed, as the weaker side, the protection of the Romans.
      Their spirit was intrepid; yet such is the uncertainty of
      courage, that the two armies were suddenly struck with a panic;
      they fled from each other, and the rival kings remained with
      their guards in the midst of an empty plain. A short truce was
      obtained; but their mutual resentment again kindled; and the
      remembrance of their shame rendered the next encounter more
      desperate and bloody. Forty thousand of the Barbarians perished
      in the decisive battle, which broke the power of the Gepidae,
      transferred the fears and wishes of Justinian, and first
      displayed the character of Alboin, the youthful prince of the
      Lombards, and the future conqueror of Italy. 10

      may draw some light from Mascou (Hist. of the Germans, and

      The wild people who dwelt or wandered in the plains of Russia,
      Lithuania, and Poland, might be reduced, in the age of Justinian,
      under the two great families of the Bulgarians 11 and the
      Sclavonians. According to the Greek writers, the former, who
      touched the Euxine and the Lake Maeotis, derived from the Huns
      their name or descent; and it is needless to renew the simple and
      well-known picture of Tartar manners. They were bold and
      dexterous archers, who drank the milk, and feasted on the flesh,
      of their fleet and indefatigable horses; whose flocks and herds
      followed, or rather guided, the motions of their roving camps; to
      whose inroads no country was remote or impervious, and who were
      practised in flight, though incapable of fear. The nation was
      divided into two powerful and hostile tribes, who pursued each
      other with fraternal hatred. They eagerly disputed the
      friendship, or rather the gifts, of the emperor; and the
      distinctions which nature had fixed between the faithful dog and
      the rapacious wolf was applied by an ambassador who received only
      verbal instructions from the mouth of his illiterate prince. 12
      The Bulgarians, of whatsoever species, were equally attracted by
      Roman wealth: they assumed a vague dominion over the Sclavonian
      name, and their rapid marches could only be stopped by the Baltic
      Sea, or the extreme cold and poverty of the north. But the same
      race of Sclavonians appears to have maintained, in every age, the
      possession of the same countries. Their numerous tribes, however
      distant or adverse, used one common language, (it was harsh and
      irregular,) and where known by the resemblance of their form,
      which deviated from the swarthy Tartar, and approached without
      attaining the lofty stature and fair complexion of the German.
      Four thousand six hundred villages 13 were scattered over the
      provinces of Russia and Poland, and their huts were hastily built
      of rough timber, in a country deficient both in stone and iron.
      Erected, or rather concealed, in the depth of forests, on the
      banks of rivers, or the edges of morasses, we may not perhaps,
      without flattery, compare them to the architecture of the beaver;
      which they resembled in a double issue, to the land and water,
      for the escape of the savage inhabitant, an animal less cleanly,
      less diligent, and less social, than that marvellous quadruped.
      The fertility of the soil, rather than the labor of the natives,
      supplied the rustic plenty of the Sclavonians. Their sheep and
      horned cattle were large and numerous, and the fields which they
      sowed with millet or panic 14 afforded, in place of bread, a
      coarse and less nutritive food. The incessant rapine of their
      neighbors compelled them to bury this treasure in the earth; but
      on the appearance of a stranger, it was freely imparted by a
      people, whose unfavorable character is qualified by the epithets
      of chaste, patient, and hospitable. As their supreme god, they
      adored an invisible master of the thunder. The rivers and the
      nymphs obtained their subordinate honors, and the popular worship
      was expressed in vows and sacrifice. The Sclavonians disdained to
      obey a despot, a prince, or even a magistrate; but their
      experience was too narrow, their passions too headstrong, to
      compose a system of equal law or general defence. Some voluntary
      respect was yielded to age and valor; but each tribe or village
      existed as a separate republic, and all must be persuaded where
      none could be compelled. They fought on foot, almost naked, and
      except an unwieldy shield, without any defensive armor; their
      weapons of offence were a bow, a quiver of small poisoned arrows,
      and a long rope, which they dexterously threw from a distance,
      and entangled their enemy in a running noose. In the field, the
      Sclavonian infantry was dangerous by their speed, agility, and
      hardiness: they swam, they dived, they remained under water,
      drawing their breath through a hollow cane; and a river or lake
      was often the scene of their unsuspected ambuscade. But these
      were the achievements of spies or stragglers; the military art
      was unknown to the Sclavonians; their name was obscure, and their
      conquests were inglorious. 15

      11 (return) [ I adopt the appellation of Bulgarians from
      Ennodius, (in Panegyr. Theodorici, Opp. Sirmond, tom. i. p. 1598,
      1599,) Jornandes, (de Rebus Geticis, c. 5, p. 194, et de Regn.
      Successione, p. 242,) Theophanes, (p. 185,) and the Chronicles of
      Cassiodorus and Marcellinus. The name of Huns is too vague; the
      tribes of the Cutturgurians and Utturgurians are too minute and
      too harsh. * Note: The Bulgarians are first mentioned among the
      writers of the West in the Panegyric on Theodoric by Ennodius,
      Bishop of Pavia. Though they perhaps took part in the conquests
      of the Huns, they did not advance to the Danube till after the
      dismemberment of that monarchy on the death of Attila. But the
      Bulgarians are mentioned much earlier by the Armenian writers.
      Above 600 years before Christ, a tribe of Bulgarians, driven from
      their native possessions beyond the Caspian, occupied a part of
      Armenia, north of the Araxes. They were of the Finnish race; part
      of the nation, in the fifth century, moved westward, and reached
      the modern Bulgaria; part remained along the Volga, which is
      called Etel, Etil, or Athil, in all the Tartar languages, but
      from the Bulgarians, the Volga. The power of the eastern
      Bulgarians was broken by Batou, son of Tchingiz Khan; that of the
      western will appear in the course of the history. From St.
      Martin, vol. vii p. 141. Malte-Brun, on the contrary, conceives
      that the Bulgarians took their name from the river. According to
      the Byzantine historians they were a branch of the Ougres,
      (Thunmann, Hist. of the People to the East of Europe,) but they
      have more resemblance to the Turks. Their first country, Great
      Bulgaria, was washed by the Volga. Some remains of their capital
      are still shown near Kasan. They afterwards dwelt in Kuban, and
      finally on the Danube, where they subdued (about the year 500)
      the Slavo-Servians established on the Lower Danube. Conquered in
      their turn by the Avars, they freed themselves from that yoke in
      635; their empire then comprised the Cutturgurians, the remains
      of the Huns established on the Palus Maeotis. The Danubian
      Bulgaria, a dismemberment of this vast state, was long formidable
      to the Byzantine empire. Malte-Brun, Prec. de Geog Univ. vol. i.
      p. 419.—M. ——According to Shafarik, the Danubian Bulgaria was
      peopled by a Slavo Bulgarian race. The Slavish population was
      conquered by the Bulgarian (of Uralian and Finnish descent,) and
      incorporated with them. This mingled race are the Bulgarians
      bordering on the Byzantine empire. Shafarik, ii 152, et seq.—M.

      iv. c. 8, tom. iii. p. 278,) a scarce, and hitherto, to me, an
      inaccessible book.]

      I have marked the faint and general outline of the Sclavonians
      and Bulgarians, without attempting to define their intermediate
      boundaries, which were not accurately known or respected by the
      Barbarians themselves. Their importance was measured by their
      vicinity to the empire; and the level country of Moldavia and
      Wallachia was occupied by the Antes, 16 a Sclavonian tribe, which
      swelled the titles of Justinian with an epithet of conquest. 17
      Against the Antes he erected the fortifications of the Lower
      Danube; and labored to secure the alliance of a people seated in
      the direct channel of northern inundation, an interval of two
      hundred miles between the mountains of Transylvania and the
      Euxine Sea. But the Antes wanted power and inclination to stem
      the fury of the torrent; and the light-armed Sclavonians, from a
      hundred tribes, pursued with almost equal speed the footsteps of
      the Bulgarian horse. The payment of one piece of gold for each
      soldier procured a safe and easy retreat through the country of
      the Gepidae, who commanded the passage of the Upper Danube. 18
      The hopes or fears of the Barbarians; their intense union or
      discord; the accident of a frozen or shallow stream; the prospect
      of harvest or vintage; the prosperity or distress of the Romans;
      were the causes which produced the uniform repetition of annual
      visits, 19 tedious in the narrative, and destructive in the
      event. The same year, and possibly the same month, in which
      Ravenna surrendered, was marked by an invasion of the Huns or
      Bulgarians, so dreadful, that it almost effaced the memory of
      their past inroads. They spread from the suburbs of
      Constantinople to the Ionian Gulf, destroyed thirty-two cities or
      castles, erased Potidaea, which Athens had built, and Philip had
      besieged, and repassed the Danube, dragging at their horses’
      heels one hundred and twenty thousand of the subjects of
      Justinian. In a subsequent inroad they pierced the wall of the
      Thracian Chersonesus, extirpated the habitations and the
      inhabitants, boldly traversed the Hellespont, and returned to
      their companions, laden with the spoils of Asia. Another party,
      which seemed a multitude in the eyes of the Romans, penetrated,
      without opposition, from the Straits of Thermopylae to the
      Isthmus of Corinth; and the last ruin of Greece has appeared an
      object too minute for the attention of history. The works which
      the emperor raised for the protection, but at the expense of his
      subjects, served only to disclose the weakness of some neglected
      part; and the walls, which by flattery had been deemed
      impregnable, were either deserted by the garrison, or scaled by
      the Barbarians. Three thousand Sclavonians, who insolently
      divided themselves into two bands, discovered the weakness and
      misery of a triumphant reign. They passed the Danube and the
      Hebrus, vanquished the Roman generals who dared to oppose their
      progress, and plundered, with impunity, the cities of Illyricum
      and Thrace, each of which had arms and numbers to overwhelm their
      contemptible assailants. Whatever praise the boldness of the
      Sclavonians may deserve, it is sullied by the wanton and
      deliberate cruelty which they are accused of exercising on their
      prisoners. Without distinction of rank, or age, or sex, the
      captives were impaled or flayed alive, or suspended between four
      posts, and beaten with clubs till they expired, or enclosed in
      some spacious building, and left to perish in the flames with the
      spoil and cattle which might impede the march of these savage
      victors. 20 Perhaps a more impartial narrative would reduce the
      number, and qualify the nature, of these horrid acts; and they
      might sometimes be excused by the cruel laws of retaliation. In
      the siege of Topirus, 21 whose obstinate defence had enraged the
      Sclavonians, they massacred fifteen thousand males; but they
      spared the women and children; the most valuable captives were
      always reserved for labor or ransom; the servitude was not
      rigorous, and the terms of their deliverance were speedy and
      moderate. But the subject, or the historian of Justinian, exhaled
      his just indignation in the language of complaint and reproach;
      and Procopius has confidently affirmed, that in a reign of
      thirty-two years, each annual inroad of the Barbarians consumed
      two hundred thousand of the inhabitants of the Roman empire. The
      entire population of Turkish Europe, which nearly corresponds
      with the provinces of Justinian, would perhaps be incapable of
      supplying six millions of persons, the result of this incredible
      estimate. 22

      In the midst of these obscure calamities, Europe felt the shock
      of revolution, which first revealed to the world the name and
      nation of the Turks. 2211 Like Romulus, the founder 2212 of that
      martial people was suckled by a she-wolf, who afterwards made him
      the father of a numerous progeny; and the representation of that
      animal in the banners of the Turks preserved the memory, or
      rather suggested the idea, of a fable, which was invented,
      without any mutual intercourse, by the shepherds of Latium and
      those of Scythia. At the equal distance of two thousand miles
      from the Caspian, the Icy, the Chinese, and the Bengal Seas, a
      ridge of mountains is conspicuous, the centre, and perhaps the
      summit, of Asia; which, in the language of different nations, has
      been styled Imaus, and Caf, 23 and Altai, and the Golden
      Mountains, 2311 and the Girdle of the Earth. The sides of the
      hills were productive of minerals; and the iron forges, 24 for
      the purpose of war, were exercised by the Turks, the most
      despised portion of the slaves of the great khan of the Geougen.
      But their servitude could only last till a leader, bold and
      eloquent, should arise to persuade his countrymen that the same
      arms which they forged for their masters, might become, in their
      own hands, the instruments of freedom and victory. They sallied
      from the mountains; 25 a sceptre was the reward of his advice;
      and the annual ceremony, in which a piece of iron was heated in
      the fire, and a smith’s hammer 2511 was successively handled by
      the prince and his nobles, recorded for ages the humble
      profession and rational pride of the Turkish nation. Bertezena,
      2512 their first leader, signalized their valor and his own in
      successful combats against the neighboring tribes; but when he
      presumed to ask in marriage the daughter of the great khan, the
      insolent demand of a slave and a mechanic was contemptuously
      rejected. The disgrace was expiated by a more noble alliance with
      a princess of China; and the decisive battle which almost
      extirpated the nation of the Geougen, established in Tartary the
      new and more powerful empire of the Turks. 2513 They reigned over
      the north; but they confessed the vanity of conquest, by their
      faithful attachment to the mountain of their fathers. The royal
      encampment seldom lost sight of Mount Altai, from whence the
      River Irtish descends to water the rich pastures of the Calmucks,
      26 which nourish the largest sheep and oxen in the world. The
      soil is fruitful, and the climate mild and temperate: the happy
      region was ignorant of earthquake and pestilence; the emperor’s
      throne was turned towards the East, and a golden wolf on the top
      of a spear seemed to guard the entrance of his tent. One of the
      successors of Bertezena was tempted by the luxury and
      superstition of China; but his design of building cities and
      temples was defeated by the simple wisdom of a Barbarian
      counsellor. “The Turks,” he said, “are not equal in number to one
      hundredth part of the inhabitants of China. If we balance their
      power, and elude their armies, it is because we wander without
      any fixed habitations in the exercise of war and hunting. Are we
      strong? we advance and conquer: are we feeble? we retire and are
      concealed. Should the Turks confine themselves within the walls
      of cities, the loss of a battle would be the destruction of their
      empire. The bonzes preach only patience, humility, and the
      renunciation of the world. Such, O king! is not the religion of
      heroes.” They entertained, with less reluctance, the doctrines of
      Zoroaster; but the greatest part of the nation acquiesced,
      without inquiry, in the opinions, or rather in the practice, of
      their ancestors. The honors of sacrifice were reserved for the
      supreme deity; they acknowledged, in rude hymns, their
      obligations to the air, the fire, the water, and the earth; and
      their priests derived some profit from the art of divination.
      Their unwritten laws were rigorous and impartial: theft was
      punished with a tenfold restitution; adultery, treason, and
      murder, with death; and no chastisement could be inflicted too
      severe for the rare and inexpiable guilt of cowardice. As the
      subject nations marched under the standard of the Turks, their
      cavalry, both men and horses, were proudly computed by millions;
      one of their effective armies consisted of four hundred thousand
      soldiers, and in less than fifty years they were connected in
      peace and war with the Romans, the Persians, and the Chinese. In
      their northern limits, some vestige may be discovered of the form
      and situation of Kamptchatka, of a people of hunters and
      fishermen, whose sledges were drawn by dogs, and whose
      habitations were buried in the earth. The Turks were ignorant of
      astronomy; but the observation taken by some learned Chinese,
      with a gnomon of eight feet, fixes the royal camp in the latitude
      of forty-nine degrees, and marks their extreme progress within
      three, or at least ten degrees, of the polar circle. 27 Among
      their southern conquests the most splendid was that of the
      Nephthalites, or white Huns, a polite and warlike people, who
      possessed the commercial cities of Bochara and Samarcand, who had
      vanquished the Persian monarch, and carried their victorious arms
      along the banks, and perhaps to the mouth, of the Indus. On the
      side of the West, the Turkish cavalry advanced to the Lake
      Maeotis. They passed that lake on the ice. The khan who dwelt at
      the foot of Mount Altai issued his commands for the siege of
      Bosphorus, 28 a city the voluntary subject of Rome, and whose
      princes had formerly been the friends of Athens. 29 To the east,
      the Turks invaded China, as often as the vigor of the government
      was relaxed: and I am taught to read in the history of the times,
      that they mowed down their patient enemies like hemp or grass;
      and that the mandarins applauded the wisdom of an emperor who
      repulsed these Barbarians with golden lances. This extent of
      savage empire compelled the Turkish monarch to establish three
      subordinate princes of his own blood, who soon forgot their
      gratitude and allegiance. The conquerors were enervated by
      luxury, which is always fatal except to an industrious people;
      the policy of China solicited the vanquished nations to resume
      their independence and the power of the Turks was limited to a
      period of two hundred years. The revival of their name and
      dominion in the southern countries of Asia are the events of a
      later age; and the dynasties, which succeeded to their native
      realms, may sleep in oblivion; since their history bears no
      relation to the decline and fall of the Roman empire. 30

      Chapter XLII: State Of The Barbaric World.—Part II.

      In the rapid career of conquest, the Turks attacked and subdued
      the nation of the Ogors or Varchonites 3011 on the banks of the
      River Til, which derived the epithet of Black from its dark water
      or gloomy forests. 31 The khan of the Ogors was slain with three
      hundred thousand of his subjects, and their bodies were scattered
      over the space of four days’ journey: their surviving countrymen
      acknowledged the strength and mercy of the Turks; and a small
      portion, about twenty thousand warriors, preferred exile to
      servitude. They followed the well-known road of the Volga,
      cherished the error of the nations who confounded them with the
      Avars, and spread the terror of that false though famous
      appellation, which had not, however, saved its lawful proprietors
      from the yoke of the Turks. 32 After a long and victorious march,
      the new Avars arrived at the foot of Mount Caucasus, in the
      country of the Alani 33 and Circassians, where they first heard
      of the splendor and weakness of the Roman empire. They humbly
      requested their confederate, the prince of the Alani, to lead
      them to this source of riches; and their ambassador, with the
      permission of the governor of Lazica, was transported by the
      Euxine Sea to Constantinople. The whole city was poured forth to
      behold with curiosity and terror the aspect of a strange people:
      their long hair, which hung in tresses down their backs, was
      gracefully bound with ribbons, but the rest of their habit
      appeared to imitate the fashion of the Huns. When they were
      admitted to the audience of Justinian, Candish, the first of the
      ambassadors, addressed the Roman emperor in these terms: “You see
      before you, O mighty prince, the representatives of the strongest
      and most populous of nations, the invincible, the irresistible
      Avars. We are willing to devote ourselves to your service: we are
      able to vanquish and destroy all the enemies who now disturb your
      repose. But we expect, as the price of our alliance, as the
      reward of our valor, precious gifts, annual subsidies, and
      fruitful possessions.” At the time of this embassy, Justinian had
      reigned above thirty, he had lived above seventy-five years: his
      mind, as well as his body, was feeble and languid; and the
      conqueror of Africa and Italy, careless of the permanent interest
      of his people, aspired only to end his days in the bosom even of
      inglorious peace. In a studied oration, he imparted to the senate
      his resolution to dissemble the insult, and to purchase the
      friendship of the Avars; and the whole senate, like the mandarins
      of China, applauded the incomparable wisdom and foresight of
      their sovereign. The instruments of luxury were immediately
      prepared to captivate the Barbarians; silken garments, soft and
      splendid beds, and chains and collars incrusted with gold. The
      ambassadors, content with such liberal reception, departed from
      Constantinople, and Valentin, one of the emperor’s guards, was
      sent with a similar character to their camp at the foot of Mount
      Caucasus. As their destruction or their success must be alike
      advantageous to the empire, he persuaded them to invade the
      enemies of Rome; and they were easily tempted, by gifts and
      promises, to gratify their ruling inclinations. These fugitives,
      who fled before the Turkish arms, passed the Tanais and
      Borysthenes, and boldly advanced into the heart of Poland and
      Germany, violating the law of nations, and abusing the rights of
      victory. Before ten years had elapsed, their camps were seated on
      the Danube and the Elbe, many Bulgarian and Sclavonian names were
      obliterated from the earth, and the remainder of their tribes are
      found, as tributaries and vassals, under the standard of the
      Avars. The chagan, the peculiar title of their king, still
      affected to cultivate the friendship of the emperor; and
      Justinian entertained some thoughts of fixing them in Pannonia,
      to balance the prevailing power of the Lombards. But the virtue
      or treachery of an Avar betrayed the secret enmity and ambitious
      designs of their countrymen; and they loudly complained of the
      timid, though jealous policy, of detaining their ambassadors, and
      denying the arms which they had been allowed to purchase in the
      capital of the empire. 34

      3011 (return) [ The Ogors or Varchonites, from Var. a river,
      (obviously connected with the name Avar,) must not be confounded
      with the Uigours, the eastern Turks, (v. Hammer, Osmanische
      Geschichte, vol. i. p. 3,) who speak a language the parent of the
      more modern Turkish dialects. Compare Klaproth, page 121. They
      are the ancestors of the Usbeck Turks. These Ogors were of the
      same Finnish race with the Huns; and the 20,000 families which
      fled towards the west, after the Turkish invasion, were of the
      same race with those which remained to the east of the Volga, the
      true Avars of Theophy fact.—M.]

      31 (return) [ The River Til, or Tula, according to the geography
      of De Guignes, (tom. i. part ii. p. lviii. and 352,) is a small,
      though grateful, stream of the desert, that falls into the Orhon,
      Selinga, &c. See Bell, Journey from Petersburg to Pekin, (vol.
      ii. p. 124;) yet his own description of the Keat, down which he
      sailed into the Oby, represents the name and attributes of the
      black river, (p. 139.) * Note: M. Klaproth, (Tableaux Historiques
      de l’Asie, p. 274) supposes this river to be an eastern affluent
      of the Volga, the Kama, which, from the color of its waters,
      might be called black. M. Abel Remusat (Recherchea sur les
      Langues Tartares, vol. i. p. 320) and M. St. Martin (vol. ix. p.
      373) consider it the Volga, which is called Atel or Etel by all
      the Turkish tribes. It is called Attilas by Menander, and Ettilia
      by the monk Ruysbreek (1253.) See Klaproth, Tabl. Hist. p. 247.
      This geography is much more clear and simple than that adopted by
      Gibbon from De Guignes, or suggested from Bell.—M.]

      32 (return) [ Theophylact, l. vii. c. 7, 8. And yet his true
      Avars are invisible even to the eyes of M. de Guignes; and what
      can be more illustrious than the false? The right of the fugitive
      Ogors to that national appellation is confessed by the Turks
      themselves, (Menander, p. 108.)]

      33 (return) [ The Alani are still found in the Genealogical
      History of the Tartars, (p. 617,) and in D’Anville’s maps. They
      opposed the march of the generals of Zingis round the Caspian
      Sea, and were overthrown in a great battle, (Hist. de Gengiscan,
      l. iv. c. 9, p. 447.)]

      34 (return) [ The embassies and first conquests of the Avars may
      be read in Menander, (Excerpt. Legat. p. 99, 100, 101, 154, 155,)
      Theophanes, (p. 196,) the Historia Miscella, (l. xvi. p. 109,)
      and Gregory of Tours, (L iv. c. 23, 29, in the Historians of
      France, tom. ii. p. 214, 217.)]

      Perhaps the apparent change in the dispositions of the emperors
      may be ascribed to the embassy which was received from the
      conquerors of the Avars. 35 The immense distance which eluded
      their arms could not extinguish their resentment: the Turkish
      ambassadors pursued the footsteps of the vanquished to the Jaik,
      the Volga, Mount Caucasus, the Euxine and Constantinople, and at
      length appeared before the successor of Constantine, to request
      that he would not espouse the cause of rebels and fugitives. Even
      commerce had some share in this remarkable negotiation: and the
      Sogdoites, who were now the tributaries of the Turks, embraced
      the fair occasion of opening, by the north of the Caspian, a new
      road for the importation of Chinese silk into the Roman empire.
      The Persian, who preferred the navigation of Ceylon, had stopped
      the caravans of Bochara and Samarcand: their silk was
      contemptuously burnt: some Turkish ambassadors died in Persia,
      with a suspicion of poison; and the great khan permitted his
      faithful vassal Maniach, the prince of the Sogdoites, to propose,
      at the Byzantine court, a treaty of alliance against their common
      enemies. Their splendid apparel and rich presents, the fruit of
      Oriental luxury, distinguished Maniach and his colleagues from
      the rude savages of the North: their letters, in the Scythian
      character and language, announced a people who had attained the
      rudiments of science: 36 they enumerated the conquests, they
      offered the friendship and military aid of the Turks; and their
      sincerity was attested by direful imprecations (if they were
      guilty of falsehood) against their own head, and the head of
      Disabul their master. The Greek prince entertained with
      hospitable regard the ambassadors of a remote and powerful
      monarch: the sight of silk-worms and looms disappointed the hopes
      of the Sogdoites; the emperor renounced, or seemed to renounce,
      the fugitive Avars, but he accepted the alliance of the Turks;
      and the ratification of the treaty was carried by a Roman
      minister to the foot of Mount Altai. Under the successors of
      Justinian, the friendship of the two nations was cultivated by
      frequent and cordial intercourse; the most favored vassals were
      permitted to imitate the example of the great khan, and one
      hundred and six Turks, who, on various occasions, had visited
      Constantinople, departed at the same time for their native
      country. The duration and length of the journey from the
      Byzantine court to Mount Altai are not specified: it might have
      been difficult to mark a road through the nameless deserts, the
      mountains, rivers, and morasses of Tartary; but a curious account
      has been preserved of the reception of the Roman ambassadors at
      the royal camp. After they had been purified with fire and
      incense, according to a rite still practised under the sons of
      Zingis, 3611 they were introduced to the presence of Disabul. In
      a valley of the Golden Mountain, they found the great khan in his
      tent, seated in a chair with wheels, to which a horse might be
      occasionally harnessed. As soon as they had delivered their
      presents, which were received by the proper officers, they
      exposed, in a florid oration, the wishes of the Roman emperor,
      that victory might attend the arms of the Turks, that their reign
      might be long and prosperous, and that a strict alliance, without
      envy or deceit, might forever be maintained between the two most
      powerful nations of the earth. The answer of Disabul corresponded
      with these friendly professions, and the ambassadors were seated
      by his side, at a banquet which lasted the greatest part of the
      day: the tent was surrounded with silk hangings, and a Tartar
      liquor was served on the table, which possessed at least the
      intoxicating qualities of wine. The entertainment of the
      succeeding day was more sumptuous; the silk hangings of the
      second tent were embroidered in various figures; and the royal
      seat, the cups, and the vases, were of gold. A third pavilion was
      supported by columns of gilt wood; a bed of pure and massy gold
      was raised on four peacocks of the same metal: and before the
      entrance of the tent, dishes, basins, and statues of solid
      silver, and admirable art, were ostentatiously piled in wagons,
      the monuments of valor rather than of industry. When Disabul led
      his armies against the frontiers of Persia, his Roman allies
      followed many days the march of the Turkish camp, nor were they
      dismissed till they had enjoyed their precedency over the envoy
      of the great king, whose loud and intemperate clamors interrupted
      the silence of the royal banquet. The power and ambition of
      Chosroes cemented the union of the Turks and Romans, who touched
      his dominions on either side: but those distant nations,
      regardless of each other, consulted the dictates of interest,
      without recollecting the obligations of oaths and treaties. While
      the successor of Disabul celebrated his father’s obsequies, he
      was saluted by the ambassadors of the emperor Tiberius, who
      proposed an invasion of Persia, and sustained, with firmness, the
      angry and perhaps the just reproaches of that haughty Barbarian.
      “You see my ten fingers,” said the great khan, and he applied
      them to his mouth. “You Romans speak with as many tongues, but
      they are tongues of deceit and perjury. To me you hold one
      language, to my subjects another; and the nations are
      successively deluded by your perfidious eloquence. You
      precipitate your allies into war and danger, you enjoy their
      labors, and you neglect your benefactors. Hasten your return,
      inform your master that a Turk is incapable of uttering or
      forgiving falsehood, and that he shall speedily meet the
      punishment which he deserves. While he solicits my friendship
      with flattering and hollow words, he is sunk to a confederate of
      my fugitive Varchonites. If I condescend to march against those
      contemptible slaves, they will tremble at the sound of our whips;
      they will be trampled, like a nest of ants, under the feet of my
      innumerable cavalry. I am not ignorant of the road which they
      have followed to invade your empire; nor can I be deceived by the
      vain pretence, that Mount Caucasus is the impregnable barrier of
      the Romans. I know the course of the Niester, the Danube, and the
      Hebrus; the most warlike nations have yielded to the arms of the
      Turks; and from the rising to the setting sun, the earth is my
      inheritance.” Notwithstanding this menace, a sense of mutual
      advantage soon renewed the alliance of the Turks and Romans: but
      the pride of the great khan survived his resentment; and when he
      announced an important conquest to his friend the emperor
      Maurice, he styled himself the master of the seven races, and the
      lord of the seven climates of the world. 37

      violently leaping about, seemed to exorcise the evil spirits.

      which we often regret the want of order and connection.]

      Disputes have often arisen between the sovereigns of Asia for the
      title of king of the world; while the contest has proved that it
      could not belong to either of the competitors. The kingdom of the
      Turks was bounded by the Oxus or Gihon; and Touran was separated
      by that great river from the rival monarchy of Iran, or Persia,
      which in a smaller compass contained perhaps a larger measure of
      power and population. The Persians, who alternately invaded and
      repulsed the Turks and the Romans, were still ruled by the house
      of Sassan, which ascended the throne three hundred years before
      the accession of Justinian. His contemporary, Cabades, or Kobad,
      had been successful in war against the emperor Anastasius; but
      the reign of that prince was distracted by civil and religious
      troubles. A prisoner in the hands of his subjects, an exile among
      the enemies of Persia, he recovered his liberty by prostituting
      the honor of his wife, and regained his kingdom with the
      dangerous and mercenary aid of the Barbarians, who had slain his
      father. His nobles were suspicious that Kobad never forgave the
      authors of his expulsion, or even those of his restoration. The
      people was deluded and inflamed by the fanaticism of Mazdak, 38
      who asserted the community of women, 39 and the equality of
      mankind, whilst he appropriated the richest lands and most
      beautiful females to the use of his sectaries. The view of these
      disorders, which had been fomented by his laws and example, 40
      imbittered the declining age of the Persian monarch; and his
      fears were increased by the consciousness of his design to
      reverse the natural and customary order of succession, in favor
      of his third and most favored son, so famous under the names of
      Chosroes and Nushirvan. To render the youth more illustrious in
      the eyes of the nations, Kobad was desirous that he should be
      adopted by the emperor Justin: 4011 the hope of peace inclined
      the Byzantine court to accept this singular proposal; and
      Chosroes might have acquired a specious claim to the inheritance
      of his Roman parent. But the future mischief was diverted by the
      advice of the quaestor Proclus: a difficulty was started, whether
      the adoption should be performed as a civil or military rite; 41
      the treaty was abruptly dissolved; and the sense of this
      indignity sunk deep into the mind of Chosroes, who had already
      advanced to the Tigris on his road to Constantinople. His father
      did not long survive the disappointment of his wishes: the
      testament of their deceased sovereign was read in the assembly of
      the nobles; and a powerful faction, prepared for the event, and
      regardless of the priority of age, exalted Chosroes to the throne
      of Persia. He filled that throne during a prosperous period of
      forty-eight years; 42 and the Justice of Nushirvan is celebrated
      as the theme of immortal praise by the nations of the East.

      history, (the Modjmal-alte-warikh in the Royal Library at Paris,
      quoted by St. Martin, vol. vii. p. 322) at Wischapour in
      Chorasan: his father’s name was Bamdadam. He announces himself as
      a reformer of Zoroastrianism, and carried the doctrine of the two
      principles to a much grater height. He preached the absolute
      indifference of human action, perfect equality of rank, community
      of property and of women, marriages between the nearest kindred;
      he interdicted the use of animal food, proscribed the killing of
      animals for food, enforced a vegetable diet. See St. Martin, vol.
      vii. p. 322. Malcolm, vol. i. p. 104. Mirkhond translated by De

      the West. Two inscriptions found in Cyrene, in 1823, and
      explained by M. Gesenius, and by M. Hamaker of Leyden, prove
      clearly that his doctrines had been eagerly embraced by the
      remains of the ancient Gnostics; and Mazdak was enrolled with

      42 (return) [ From Procopius and Agathias, Pagi (tom. ii. p. 543,
      626) has proved that Chosroes Nushirvan ascended the throne in
      the fifth year of Justinian, (A.D. 531, April 1.—A.D. 532, April
      1.) But the true chronology, which harmonizes with the Greeks and
      Orientals, is ascertained by John Malala, (tom. ii. 211.)
      Cabades, or Kobad, after a reign of forty-three years and two
      months, sickened the 8th, and died the 13th of September, A.D.
      531, aged eighty-two years. According to the annals of Eutychius,
      Nushirvan reigned forty seven years and six months; and his death
      must consequently be placed in March, A.D. 579.]

      But the justice of kings is understood by themselves, and even by
      their subjects, with an ample indulgence for the gratification of
      passion and interest. The virtue of Chosroes was that of a
      conqueror, who, in the measures of peace and war, is excited by
      ambition, and restrained by prudence; who confounds the greatness
      with the happiness of a nation, and calmly devotes the lives of
      thousands to the fame, or even the amusement, of a single man. In
      his domestic administration, the just Nushirvan would merit in
      our feelings the appellation of a tyrant. His two elder brothers
      had been deprived of their fair expectations of the diadem: their
      future life, between the supreme rank and the condition of
      subjects, was anxious to themselves and formidable to their
      master: fear as well as revenge might tempt them to rebel: the
      slightest evidence of a conspiracy satisfied the author of their
      wrongs; and the repose of Chosroes was secured by the death of
      these unhappy princes, with their families and adherents. One
      guiltless youth was saved and dismissed by the compassion of a
      veteran general; and this act of humanity, which was revealed by
      his son, overbalanced the merit of reducing twelve nations to the
      obedience of Persia. The zeal and prudence of Mebodes had fixed
      the diadem on the head of Chosroes himself; but he delayed to
      attend the royal summons, till he had performed the duties of a
      military review: he was instantly commanded to repair to the iron
      tripod, which stood before the gate of the palace, 43 where it
      was death to relieve or approach the victim; and Mebodes
      languished several days before his sentence was pronounced, by
      the inflexible pride and calm ingratitude of the son of Kobad.
      But the people, more especially in the East, is disposed to
      forgive, and even to applaud, the cruelty which strikes at the
      loftiest heads; at the slaves of ambition, whose voluntary choice
      has exposed them to live in the smiles, and to perish by the
      frown, of a capricious monarch. In the execution of the laws
      which he had no temptation to violate; in the punishment of
      crimes which attacked his own dignity, as well as the happiness
      of individuals; Nushirvan, or Chosroes, deserved the appellation
      of just. His government was firm, rigorous, and impartial. It was
      the first labor of his reign to abolish the dangerous theory of
      common or equal possessions: the lands and women which the
      sectaries of Mazdak has usurped were restored to their lawful
      owners; and the temperate 4311 chastisement of the fanatics or
      impostors confirmed the domestic rights of society. Instead of
      listening with blind confidence to a favorite minister, he
      established four viziers over the four great provinces of his
      empire, Assyria, Media, Persia, and Bactriana. In the choice of
      judges, praefects, and counsellors, he strove to remove the mask
      which is always worn in the presence of kings: he wished to
      substitute the natural order of talents for the accidental
      distinctions of birth and fortune; he professed, in specious
      language, his intention to prefer those men who carried the poor
      in their bosoms, and to banish corruption from the seat of
      justice, as dogs were excluded from the temples of the Magi. The
      code of laws of the first Artaxerxes was revived and published as
      the rule of the magistrates; but the assurance of speedy
      punishment was the best security of their virtue. Their behavior
      was inspected by a thousand eyes, their words were overheard by a
      thousand ears, the secret or public agents of the throne; and the
      provinces, from the Indian to the Arabian confines, were
      enlightened by the frequent visits of a sovereign, who affected
      to emulate his celestial brother in his rapid and salutary
      career. Education and agriculture he viewed as the two objects
      most deserving of his care. In every city of Persia orphans, and
      the children of the poor, were maintained and instructed at the
      public expense; the daughters were given in marriage to the
      richest citizens of their own rank, and the sons, according to
      their different talents, were employed in mechanic trades, or
      promoted to more honorable service. The deserted villages were
      relieved by his bounty; to the peasants and farmers who were
      found incapable of cultivating their lands, he distributed
      cattle, seed, and the instruments of husbandry; and the rare and
      inestimable treasure of fresh water was parsimoniously managed,
      and skilfully dispersed over the arid territory of Persia. 44 The
      prosperity of that kingdom was the effect and evidence of his
      virtues; his vices are those of Oriental despotism; but in the
      long competition between Chosroes and Justinian, the advantage
      both of merit and fortune is almost always on the side of the
      Barbarian. 45

      spurious or genuine testament of Nushirvan.]

      To the praise of justice Nushirvan united the reputation of
      knowledge; and the seven Greek philosophers, who visited his
      court, were invited and deceived by the strange assurance, that a
      disciple of Plato was seated on the Persian throne. Did they
      expect, that a prince, strenuously exercised in the toils of war
      and government, should agitate, with dexterity like their own,
      the abstruse and profound questions which amused the leisure of
      the schools of Athens? Could they hope that the precepts of
      philosophy should direct the life, and control the passions, of a
      despot, whose infancy had been taught to consider his absolute
      and fluctuating will as the only rule of moral obligation? 46 The
      studies of Chosroes were ostentatious and superficial: but his
      example awakened the curiosity of an ingenious people, and the
      light of science was diffused over the dominions of Persia. 47 At
      Gondi Sapor, in the neighborhood of the royal city of Susa, an
      academy of physic was founded, which insensibly became a liberal
      school of poetry, philosophy, and rhetoric. 48 The annals of the
      monarchy 49 were composed; and while recent and authentic history
      might afford some useful lessons both to the prince and people,
      the darkness of the first ages was embellished by the giants, the
      dragons, and the fabulous heroes of Oriental romance. 50 Every
      learned or confident stranger was enriched by the bounty, and
      flattered by the conversation, of the monarch: he nobly rewarded
      a Greek physician, 51 by the deliverance of three thousand,
      captives; and the sophists, who contended for his favor, were
      exasperated by the wealth and insolence of Uranius, their more
      successful rival. Nushirvan believed, or at least respected, the
      religion of the Magi; and some traces of persecution may be
      discovered in his reign. 52 Yet he allowed himself freely to
      compare the tenets of the various sects; and the theological
      disputes, in which he frequently presided, diminished the
      authority of the priest, and enlightened the minds of the people.
      At his command, the most celebrated writers of Greece and India
      were translated into the Persian language; a smooth and elegant
      idiom, recommended by Mahomet to the use of paradise; though it
      is branded with the epithets of savage and unmusical, by the
      ignorance and presumption of Agathias. 53 Yet the Greek historian
      might reasonably wonder that it should be found possible to
      execute an entire version of Plato and Aristotle in a foreign
      dialect, which had not been framed to express the spirit of
      freedom and the subtilties of philosophic disquisition. And, if
      the reason of the Stagyrite might be equally dark, or equally
      intelligible in every tongue, the dramatic art and verbal
      argumentation of the disciple of Socrates, 54 appear to be
      indissolubly mingled with the grace and perfection of his Attic
      style. In the search of universal knowledge, Nushirvan was
      informed, that the moral and political fables of Pilpay, an
      ancient Brachman, were preserved with jealous reverence among the
      treasures of the kings of India. The physician Perozes was
      secretly despatched to the banks of the Ganges, with instructions
      to procure, at any price, the communication of this valuable
      work. His dexterity obtained a transcript, his learned diligence
      accomplished the translation; and the fables of Pilpay 55 were
      read and admired in the assembly of Nushirvan and his nobles. The
      Indian original, and the Persian copy, have long since
      disappeared; but this venerable monument has been saved by the
      curiosity of the Arabian caliphs, revived in the modern Persic,
      the Turkish, the Syriac, the Hebrew, and the Greek idioms, and
      transfused through successive versions into the modern languages
      of Europe. In their present form, the peculiar character, the
      manners and religion of the Hindoos, are completely obliterated;
      and the intrinsic merit of the fables of Pilpay is far inferior
      to the concise elegance of Phaedrus, and the native graces of La
      Fontaine. Fifteen moral and political sentences are illustrated
      in a series of apologues: but the composition is intricate, the
      narrative prolix, and the precept obvious and barren. Yet the
      Brachman may assume the merit of inventing a pleasing fiction,
      which adorns the nakedness of truth, and alleviates, perhaps, to
      a royal ear, the harshness of instruction. With a similar design,
      to admonish kings that they are strong only in the strength of
      their subjects, the same Indians invented the game of chess,
      which was likewise introduced into Persia under the reign of
      Nushirvan. 56

      Chapter XLII: State Of The Barbaric World.—Part III.

      The son of Kobad found his kingdom involved in a war with the
      successor of Constantine; and the anxiety of his domestic
      situation inclined him to grant the suspension of arms, which
      Justinian was impatient to purchase. Chosroes saw the Roman
      ambassadors at his feet. He accepted eleven thousand pounds of
      gold, as the price of an endless or indefinite peace: 57 some
      mutual exchanges were regulated; the Persian assumed the guard of
      the gates of Caucasus, and the demolition of Dara was suspended,
      on condition that it should never be made the residence of the
      general of the East. This interval of repose had been solicited,
      and was diligently improved, by the ambition of the emperor: his
      African conquests were the first fruits of the Persian treaty;
      and the avarice of Chosroes was soothed by a large portion of the
      spoils of Carthage, which his ambassadors required in a tone of
      pleasantry and under the color of friendship. 58 But the trophies
      of Belisarius disturbed the slumbers of the great king; and he
      heard with astonishment, envy, and fear, that Sicily, Italy, and
      Rome itself, had been reduced, in three rapid campaigns, to the
      obedience of Justinian. Unpractised in the art of violating
      treaties, he secretly excited his bold and subtle vassal
      Almondar. That prince of the Saracens, who resided at Hira, 59
      had not been included in the general peace, and still waged an
      obscure war against his rival Arethas, the chief of the tribe of
      Gassan, and confederate of the empire. The subject of their
      dispute was an extensive sheep-walk in the desert to the south of
      Palmyra. An immemorial tribute for the license of pasture
      appeared to attest the rights of Almondar, while the Gassanite
      appealed to the Latin name of strata, a paved road, as an
      unquestionable evidence of the sovereignty and labors of the
      Romans. 60 The two monarchs supported the cause of their
      respective vassals; and the Persian Arab, without expecting the
      event of a slow and doubtful arbitration, enriched his flying
      camp with the spoil and captives of Syria. Instead of repelling
      the arms, Justinian attempted to seduce the fidelity of Almondar,
      while he called from the extremities of the earth the nations of
      Aethiopia and Scythia to invade the dominions of his rival. But
      the aid of such allies was distant and precarious, and the
      discovery of this hostile correspondence justified the complaints
      of the Goths and Armenians, who implored, almost at the same
      time, the protection of Chosroes. The descendants of Arsaces, who
      were still numerous in Armenia, had been provoked to assert the
      last relics of national freedom and hereditary rank; and the
      ambassadors of Vitiges had secretly traversed the empire to
      expose the instant, and almost inevitable, danger of the kingdom
      of Italy. Their representations were uniform, weighty, and
      effectual. “We stand before your throne, the advocates of your
      interest as well as of our own. The ambitious and faithless
      Justinian aspires to be the sole master of the world. Since the
      endless peace, which betrayed the common freedom of mankind, that
      prince, your ally in words, your enemy in actions, has alike
      insulted his friends and foes, and has filled the earth with
      blood and confusion. Has he not violated the privileges of
      Armenia, the independence of Colchos, and the wild liberty of the
      Tzanian mountains? Has he not usurped, with equal avidity, the
      city of Bosphorus on the frozen Maeotis, and the vale of
      palm-trees on the shores of the Red Sea? The Moors, the Vandals,
      the Goths, have been successively oppressed, and each nation has
      calmly remained the spectator of their neighbor’s ruin. Embrace,
      O king! the favorable moment; the East is left without defence,
      while the armies of Justinian and his renowned general are
      detained in the distant regions of the West. If you hesitate or
      delay, Belisarius and his victorious troops will soon return from
      the Tyber to the Tigris, and Persia may enjoy the wretched
      consolation of being the last devoured.” 61 By such arguments,
      Chosroes was easily persuaded to imitate the example which he
      condemned: but the Persian, ambitious of military fame, disdained
      the inactive warfare of a rival, who issued his sanguinary
      commands from the secure station of the Byzantine palace.

      Justinian was the true author of the war, (Persic. l. ii. c. 2,
      3.)]

      Whatever might be the provocations of Chosroes, he abused the
      confidence of treaties; and the just reproaches of dissimulation
      and falsehood could only be concealed by the lustre of his
      victories. 62 The Persian army, which had been assembled in the
      plains of Babylon, prudently declined the strong cities of
      Mesopotamia, and followed the western bank of the Euphrates, till
      the small, though populous, town of Dura 6211 presumed to arrest
      the progress of the great king. The gates of Dura, by treachery
      and surprise, were burst open; and as soon as Chosroes had
      stained his cimeter with the blood of the inhabitants, he
      dismissed the ambassador of Justinian to inform his master in
      what place he had left the enemy of the Romans. The conqueror
      still affected the praise of humanity and justice; and as he
      beheld a noble matron with her infant rudely dragged along the
      ground, he sighed, he wept, and implored the divine justice to
      punish the author of these calamities. Yet the herd of twelve
      thousand captives was ransomed for two hundred pounds of gold;
      the neighboring bishop of Sergiopolis pledged his faith for the
      payment: and in the subsequent year the unfeeling avarice of
      Chosroes exacted the penalty of an obligation which it was
      generous to contract and impossible to discharge. He advanced
      into the heart of Syria: but a feeble enemy, who vanished at his
      approach, disappointed him of the honor of victory; and as he
      could not hope to establish his dominion, the Persian king
      displayed in this inroad the mean and rapacious vices of a
      robber. Hierapolis, Berrhaea or Aleppo, Apamea and Chalcis, were
      successively besieged: they redeemed their safety by a ransom of
      gold or silver, proportioned to their respective strength and
      opulence; and their new master enforced, without observing, the
      terms of capitulation. Educated in the religion of the Magi, he
      exercised, without remorse, the lucrative trade of sacrilege;
      and, after stripping of its gold and gems a piece of the true
      cross, he generously restored the naked relic to the devotion of
      the Christians of Apamea. No more than fourteen years had elapsed
      since Antioch was ruined by an earthquake; 6212 but the queen of
      the East, the new Theopolis, had been raised from the ground by
      the liberality of Justinian; and the increasing greatness of the
      buildings and the people already erased the memory of this recent
      disaster. On one side, the city was defended by the mountain, on
      the other by the River Orontes; but the most accessible part was
      commanded by a superior eminence: the proper remedies were
      rejected, from the despicable fear of discovering its weakness to
      the enemy; and Germanus, the emperor’s nephew, refused to trust
      his person and dignity within the walls of a besieged city. The
      people of Antioch had inherited the vain and satirical genius of
      their ancestors: they were elated by a sudden reenforcement of
      six thousand soldiers; they disdained the offers of an easy
      capitulation and their intemperate clamors insulted from the
      ramparts the majesty of the great king. Under his eye the Persian
      myriads mounted with scaling-ladders to the assault; the Roman
      mercenaries fled through the opposite gate of Daphne; and the
      generous assistance of the youth of Antioch served only to
      aggravate the miseries of their country. As Chosroes, attended by
      the ambassadors of Justinian, was descending from the mountain,
      he affected, in a plaintive voice, to deplore the obstinacy and
      ruin of that unhappy people; but the slaughter still raged with
      unrelenting fury; and the city, at the command of a Barbarian,
      was delivered to the flames. The cathedral of Antioch was indeed
      preserved by the avarice, not the piety, of the conqueror: a more
      honorable exemption was granted to the church of St. Julian, and
      the quarter of the town where the ambassadors resided; some
      distant streets were saved by the shifting of the wind, and the
      walls still subsisted to protect, and soon to betray, their new
      inhabitants. Fanaticism had defaced the ornaments of Daphne, but
      Chosroes breathed a purer air amidst her groves and fountains;
      and some idolaters in his train might sacrifice with impunity to
      the nymphs of that elegant retreat. Eighteen miles below Antioch,
      the River Orontes falls into the Mediterranean. The haughty
      Persian visited the term of his conquests; and, after bathing
      alone in the sea, he offered a solemn sacrifice of thanksgiving
      to the sun, or rather to the Creator of the sun, whom the Magi
      adored. If this act of superstition offended the prejudices of
      the Syrians, they were pleased by the courteous and even eager
      attention with which he assisted at the games of the circus; and
      as Chosroes had heard that the blue faction was espoused by the
      emperor, his peremptory command secured the victory of the green
      charioteer. From the discipline of his camp the people derived
      more solid consolation; and they interceded in vain for the life
      of a soldier who had too faithfully copied the rapine of the just
      Nushirvan. At length, fatigued, though unsatiated, with the spoil
      of Syria, 6213 he slowly moved to the Euphrates, formed a
      temporary bridge in the neighborhood of Barbalissus, and defined
      the space of three days for the entire passage of his numerous
      host. After his return, he founded, at the distance of one day’s
      journey from the palace of Ctesiphon, a new city, which
      perpetuated the joint names of Chosroes and of Antioch. The
      Syrian captives recognized the form and situation of their native
      abodes: baths and a stately circus were constructed for their
      use; and a colony of musicians and charioteers revived in Assyria
      the pleasures of a Greek capital. By the munificence of the royal
      founder, a liberal allowance was assigned to these fortunate
      exiles; and they enjoyed the singular privilege of bestowing
      freedom on the slaves whom they acknowledged as their kinsmen.
      Palestine, and the holy wealth of Jerusalem, were the next
      objects that attracted the ambition, or rather the avarice, of
      Chosroes. Constantinople, and the palace of the Caesars, no
      longer appeared impregnable or remote; and his aspiring fancy
      already covered Asia Minor with the troops, and the Black Sea
      with the navies, of Persia.

      These hopes might have been realized, if the conqueror of Italy
      had not been seasonably recalled to the defence of the East. 63
      While Chosroes pursued his ambitious designs on the coast of the
      Euxine, Belisarius, at the head of an army without pay or
      discipline, encamped beyond the Euphrates, within six miles of
      Nisibis. He meditated, by a skilful operation, to draw the
      Persians from their impregnable citadel, and improving his
      advantage in the field, either to intercept their retreat, or
      perhaps to enter the gates with the flying Barbarians. He
      advanced one day’s journey on the territories of Persia, reduced
      the fortress of Sisaurane, and sent the governor, with eight
      hundred chosen horsemen, to serve the emperor in his Italian
      wars. He detached Arethas and his Arabs, supported by twelve
      hundred Romans, to pass the Tigris, and to ravage the harvests of
      Assyria, a fruitful province, long exempt from the calamities of
      war. But the plans of Belisarius were disconcerted by the
      untractable spirit of Arethas, who neither returned to the camp,
      nor sent any intelligence of his motions. The Roman general was
      fixed in anxious expectation to the same spot; the time of action
      elapsed, the ardent sun of Mesopotamia inflamed with fevors the
      blood of his European soldiers; and the stationary troops and
      officers of Syria affected to tremble for the safety of their
      defenceless cities. Yet this diversion had already succeeded in
      forcing Chosroes to return with loss and precipitation; and if
      the skill of Belisarius had been seconded by discipline and
      valor, his success might have satisfied the sanguine wishes of
      the public, who required at his hands the conquest of Ctesiphon,
      and the deliverance of the captives of Antioch. At the end of the
      campaign, he was recalled to Constantinople by an ungrateful
      court, but the dangers of the ensuing spring restored his
      confidence and command; and the hero, almost alone, was
      despatched, with the speed of post-horses, to repel, by his name
      and presence, the invasion of Syria. He found the Roman generals,
      among whom was a nephew of Justinian, imprisoned by their fears
      in the fortifications of Hierapolis. But instead of listening to
      their timid counsels, Belisarius commanded them to follow him to
      Europus, where he had resolved to collect his forces, and to
      execute whatever God should inspire him to achieve against the
      enemy. His firm attitude on the banks of the Euphrates restrained
      Chosroes from advancing towards Palestine; and he received with
      art and dignity the ambassadors, or rather spies, of the Persian
      monarch. The plain between Hierapolis and the river was covered
      with the squadrons of cavalry, six thousand hunters, tall and
      robust, who pursued their game without the apprehension of an
      enemy. On the opposite bank the ambassadors descried a thousand
      Armenian horse, who appeared to guard the passage of the
      Euphrates. The tent of Belisarius was of the coarsest linen, the
      simple equipage of a warrior who disdained the luxury of the
      East. Around his tent, the nations who marched under his standard
      were arranged with skilful confusion. The Thracians and Illyrians
      were posted in the front, the Heruli and Goths in the centre; the
      prospect was closed by the Moors and Vandals, and their loose
      array seemed to multiply their numbers. Their dress was light and
      active; one soldier carried a whip, another a sword, a third a
      bow, a fourth, perhaps, a battle axe, and the whole picture
      exhibited the intrepidity of the troops and the vigilance of the
      general. Chosroes was deluded by the address, and awed by the
      genius, of the lieutenant of Justinian. Conscious of the merit,
      and ignorant of the force, of his antagonist, he dreaded a
      decisive battle in a distant country, from whence not a Persian
      might return to relate the melancholy tale. The great king
      hastened to repass the Euphrates; and Belisarius pressed his
      retreat, by affecting to oppose a measure so salutary to the
      empire, and which could scarcely have been prevented by an army
      of a hundred thousand men. Envy might suggest to ignorance and
      pride, that the public enemy had been suffered to escape: but the
      African and Gothic triumphs are less glorious than this safe and
      bloodless victory, in which neither fortune, nor the valor of the
      soldiers, can subtract any part of the general’s renown. The
      second removal of Belisarius from the Persian to the Italian war
      revealed the extent of his personal merit, which had corrected or
      supplied the want of discipline and courage. Fifteen generals,
      without concert or skill, led through the mountains of Armenia an
      army of thirty thousand Romans, inattentive to their signals,
      their ranks, and their ensigns. Four thousand Persians,
      intrenched in the camp of Dubis, vanquished, almost without a
      combat, this disorderly multitude; their useless arms were
      scattered along the road, and their horses sunk under the fatigue
      of their rapid flight. But the Arabs of the Roman party prevailed
      over their brethren; the Armenians returned to their allegiance;
      the cities of Dara and Edessa resisted a sudden assault and a
      regular siege, and the calamities of war were suspended by those
      of pestilence. A tacit or formal agreement between the two
      sovereigns protected the tranquillity of the Eastern frontier;
      and the arms of Chosroes were confined to the Colchian or Lazic
      war, which has been too minutely described by the historians of
      the times. 64

      The extreme length of the Euxine Sea 65 from Constantinople to
      the mouth of the Phasis, may be computed as a voyage of nine
      days, and a measure of seven hundred miles. From the Iberian
      Caucasus, the most lofty and craggy mountains of Asia, that river
      descends with such oblique vehemence, that in a short space it is
      traversed by one hundred and twenty bridges. Nor does the stream
      become placid and navigable, till it reaches the town of
      Sarapana, five days’ journey from the Cyrus, which flows from the
      same hills, but in a contrary direction to the Caspian Lake. The
      proximity of these rivers has suggested the practice, or at least
      the idea, of wafting the precious merchandise of India down the
      Oxus, over the Caspian, up the Cyrus, and with the current of the
      Phasis into the Euxine and Mediterranean Seas. As it successively
      collects the streams of the plain of Colchos, the Phasis moves
      with diminished speed, though accumulated weight. At the mouth it
      is sixty fathom deep, and half a league broad, but a small woody
      island is interposed in the midst of the channel; the water, so
      soon as it has deposited an earthy or metallic sediment, floats
      on the surface of the waves, and is no longer susceptible of
      corruption. In a course of one hundred miles, forty of which are
      navigable for large vessels, the Phasis divides the celebrated
      region of Colchos, 66 or Mingrelia, 67 which, on three sides, is
      fortified by the Iberian and Armenian mountains, and whose
      maritime coast extends about two hundred miles from the
      neighborhood of Trebizond to Dioscurias and the confines of
      Circassia. Both the soil and climate are relaxed by excessive
      moisture: twenty-eight rivers, besides the Phasis and his
      dependent streams, convey their waters to the sea; and the
      hollowness of the ground appears to indicate the subterraneous
      channels between the Euxine and the Caspian. In the fields where
      wheat or barley is sown, the earth is too soft to sustain the
      action of the plough; but the gom, a small grain, not unlike the
      millet or coriander seed, supplies the ordinary food of the
      people; and the use of bread is confined to the prince and his
      nobles. Yet the vintage is more plentiful than the harvest; and
      the bulk of the stems, as well as the quality of the wine,
      display the unassisted powers of nature. The same powers
      continually tend to overshadow the face of the country with thick
      forests; the timber of the hills, and the flax of the plains,
      contribute to the abundance of naval stores; the wild and tame
      animals, the horse, the ox, and the hog, are remarkably prolific,
      and the name of the pheasant is expressive of his native
      habitation on the banks of the Phasis. The gold mines to the
      south of Trebizond, which are still worked with sufficient
      profit, were a subject of national dispute between Justinian and
      Chosroes; and it is not unreasonable to believe, that a vein of
      precious metal may be equally diffused through the circle of the
      hills, although these secret treasures are neglected by the
      laziness, or concealed by the prudence, of the Mingrelians. The
      waters, impregnated with particles of gold, are carefully
      strained through sheep-skins or fleeces; but this expedient, the
      groundwork perhaps of a marvellous fable, affords a faint image
      of the wealth extracted from a virgin earth by the power and
      industry of ancient kings. Their silver palaces and golden
      chambers surpass our belief; but the fame of their riches is said
      to have excited the enterprising avarice of the Argonauts. 68
      Tradition has affirmed, with some color of reason, that Egypt
      planted on the Phasis a learned and polite colony, 69 which
      manufactured linen, built navies, and invented geographical maps.
      The ingenuity of the moderns has peopled, with flourishing cities
      and nations, the isthmus between the Euxine and the Caspian; 70
      and a lively writer, observing the resemblance of climate, and,
      in his apprehension, of trade, has not hesitated to pronounce
      Colchos the Holland of antiquity. 71

      and the commerce of antiquity.]

      But the riches of Colchos shine only through the darkness of
      conjecture or tradition; and its genuine history presents a
      uniform scene of rudeness and poverty. If one hundred and thirty
      languages were spoken in the market of Dioscurias, 72 they were
      the imperfect idioms of so many savage tribes or families,
      sequestered from each other in the valleys of Mount Caucasus; and
      their separation, which diminished the importance, must have
      multiplied the number, of their rustic capitals. In the present
      state of Mingrelia, a village is an assemblage of huts within a
      wooden fence; the fortresses are seated in the depths of forests;
      the princely town of Cyta, or Cotatis, consists of two hundred
      houses, and a stone edifice appertains only to the magnificence
      of kings. Twelve ships from Constantinople, and about sixty
      barks, laden with the fruits of industry, annually cast anchor on
      the coast; and the list of Colchian exports is much increased,
      since the natives had only slaves and hides to offer in exchange
      for the corn and salt which they purchased from the subjects of
      Justinian. Not a vestige can be found of the art, the knowledge,
      or the navigation, of the ancient Colchians: few Greeks desired
      or dared to pursue the footsteps of the Argonauts; and even the
      marks of an Egyptian colony are lost on a nearer approach. The
      rite of circumcision is practised only by the Mahometans of the
      Euxine; and the curled hair and swarthy complexion of Africa no
      longer disfigure the most perfect of the human race. It is in the
      adjacent climates of Georgia, Mingrelia, and Circassia, that
      nature has placed, at least to our eyes, the model of beauty in
      the shape of the limbs, the color of the skin, the symmetry of
      the features, and the expression of the countenance. 73 According
      to the destination of the two sexes, the men seemed formed for
      action, the women for love; and the perpetual supply of females
      from Mount Caucasus has purified the blood, and improved the
      breed, of the southern nations of Asia. The proper district of
      Mingrelia, a portion only of the ancient Colchos, has long
      sustained an exportation of twelve thousand slaves. The number of
      prisoners or criminals would be inadequate to the annual demand;
      but the common people are in a state of servitude to their lords;
      the exercise of fraud or rapine is unpunished in a lawless
      community; and the market is continually replenished by the abuse
      of civil and paternal authority. Such a trade, 74 which reduces
      the human species to the level of cattle, may tend to encourage
      marriage and population, since the multitude of children enriches
      their sordid and inhuman parent. But this source of impure wealth
      must inevitably poison the national manners, obliterate the sense
      of honor and virtue, and almost extinguish the instincts of
      nature: the Christians of Georgia and Mingrelia are the most
      dissolute of mankind; and their children, who, in a tender age,
      are sold into foreign slavery, have already learned to imitate
      the rapine of the father and the prostitution of the mother. Yet,
      amidst the rudest ignorance, the untaught natives discover a
      singular dexterity both of mind and hand; and although the want
      of union and discipline exposes them to their more powerful
      neighbors, a bold and intrepid spirit has animated the Colchians
      of every age. In the host of Xerxes, they served on foot; and
      their arms were a dagger or a javelin, a wooden casque, and a
      buckler of raw hides. But in their own country the use of cavalry
      has more generally prevailed: the meanest of the peasants
      disdained to walk; the martial nobles are possessed, perhaps, of
      two hundred horses; and above five thousand are numbered in the
      train of the prince of Mingrelia. The Colchian government has
      been always a pure and hereditary kingdom; and the authority of
      the sovereign is only restrained by the turbulence of his
      subjects. Whenever they were obedient, he could lead a numerous
      army into the field; but some faith is requisite to believe, that
      the single tribe of the Suanians as composed of two hundred
      thousand soldiers, or that the population of Mingrelia now
      amounts to four millions of inhabitants. 75

      Chapter XLII: State Of The Barbaric World.—Part IV.

      It was the boast of the Colchians, that their ancestors had
      checked the victories of Sesostris; and the defeat of the
      Egyptian is less incredible than his successful progress as far
      as the foot of Mount Caucasus. They sunk without any memorable
      effort, under the arms of Cyrus; followed in distant wars the
      standard of the great king, and presented him every fifth year
      with one hundred boys, and as many virgins, the fairest produce
      of the land. 76 Yet he accepted this gift like the gold and ebony
      of India, the frankincense of the Arabs, or the negroes and ivory
      of Aethiopia: the Colchians were not subject to the dominion of a
      satrap, and they continued to enjoy the name as well as substance
      of national independence. 77 After the fall of the Persian
      empire, Mithridates, king of Pontus, added Colchos to the wide
      circle of his dominions on the Euxine; and when the natives
      presumed to request that his son might reign over them, he bound
      the ambitious youth in chains of gold, and delegated a servant in
      his place. In pursuit of Mithridates, the Romans advanced to the
      banks of the Phasis, and their galleys ascended the river till
      they reached the camp of Pompey and his legions. 78 But the
      senate, and afterwards the emperors, disdained to reduce that
      distant and useless conquest into the form of a province. The
      family of a Greek rhetorician was permitted to reign in Colchos
      and the adjacent kingdoms from the time of Mark Antony to that of
      Nero; and after the race of Polemo 79 was extinct, the eastern
      Pontus, which preserved his name, extended no farther than the
      neighborhood of Trebizond. Beyond these limits the fortifications
      of Hyssus, of Apsarus, of the Phasis, of Dioscurias or
      Sebastopolis, and of Pityus, were guarded by sufficient
      detachments of horse and foot; and six princes of Colchos
      received their diadems from the lieutenants of Caesar. One of
      these lieutenants, the eloquent and philosophic Arrian, surveyed,
      and has described, the Euxine coast, under the reign of Hadrian.
      The garrison which he reviewed at the mouth of the Phasis
      consisted of four hundred chosen legionaries; the brick walls and
      towers, the double ditch, and the military engines on the
      rampart, rendered this place inaccessible to the Barbarians: but
      the new suburbs which had been built by the merchants and
      veterans, required, in the opinion of Arrian, some external
      defence. 80 As the strength of the empire was gradually impaired,
      the Romans stationed on the Phasis were neither withdrawn nor
      expelled; and the tribe of the Lazi, 81 whose posterity speak a
      foreign dialect, and inhabit the sea coast of Trebizond, imposed
      their name and dominion on the ancient kingdom of Colchos. Their
      independence was soon invaded by a formidable neighbor, who had
      acquired, by arms and treaties, the sovereignty of Iberia. The
      dependent king of Lazica received his sceptre at the hands of the
      Persian monarch, and the successors of Constantine acquiesced in
      this injurious claim, which was proudly urged as a right of
      immemorial prescription. In the beginning of the sixth century,
      their influence was restored by the introduction of Christianity,
      which the Mingrelians still profess with becoming zeal, without
      understanding the doctrines, or observing the precepts, of their
      religion. After the decease of his father, Zathus was exalted to
      the regal dignity by the favor of the great king; but the pious
      youth abhorred the ceremonies of the Magi, and sought, in the
      palace of Constantinople, an orthodox baptism, a noble wife, and
      the alliance of the emperor Justin. The king of Lazica was
      solemnly invested with the diadem, and his cloak and tunic of
      white silk, with a gold border, displayed, in rich embroidery,
      the figure of his new patron; who soothed the jealousy of the
      Persian court, and excused the revolt of Colchos, by the
      venerable names of hospitality and religion. The common interest
      of both empires imposed on the Colchians the duty of guarding the
      passes of Mount Caucasus, where a wall of sixty miles is now
      defended by the monthly service of the musketeers of Mingrelia.

      81 (return) [ In the time of Pliny, Arrian, and Ptolemy, the Lazi
      were a particular tribe on the northern skirts of Colchos,
      (Cellarius, Geograph. Antiq. tom. ii. p. 222.) In the age of
      Justinian, they spread, or at least reigned, over the whole
      country. At present, they have migrated along the coast towards
      Trebizond, and compose a rude sea-faring people, with a peculiar
      language, (Chardin, p. 149. Peyssonel p. 64.)]

      82 (return) [ John Malala, Chron. tom. ii. p. 134—137 Theophanes,
      p. 144. Hist. Miscell. l. xv. p. 103. The fact is authentic, but
      the date seems too recent. In speaking of their Persian alliance,
      the Lazi contemporaries of Justinian employ the most obsolete
      words, &c. Could they belong to a connection which had not been
      dissolved above twenty years?]

      But this honorable connection was soon corrupted by the avarice
      and ambition of the Romans. Degraded from the rank of allies, the
      Lazi were incessantly reminded, by words and actions, of their
      dependent state. At the distance of a day’s journey beyond the
      Apsarus, they beheld the rising fortress of Petra, 83 which
      commanded the maritime country to the south of the Phasis.
      Instead of being protected by the valor, Colchos was insulted by
      the licentiousness, of foreign mercenaries; the benefits of
      commerce were converted into base and vexatious monopoly; and
      Gubazes, the native prince, was reduced to a pageant of royalty,
      by the superior influence of the officers of Justinian.
      Disappointed in their expectations of Christian virtue, the
      indignant Lazi reposed some confidence in the justice of an
      unbeliever. After a private assurance that their ambassadors
      should not be delivered to the Romans, they publicly solicited
      the friendship and aid of Chosroes. The sagacious monarch
      instantly discerned the use and importance of Colchos; and
      meditated a plan of conquest, which was renewed at the end of a
      thousand years by Shah Abbas, the wisest and most powerful of his
      successors. 84 His ambition was fired by the hope of launching a
      Persian navy from the Phasis, of commanding the trade and
      navigation of the Euxine Sea, of desolating the coast of Pontus
      and Bithynia, of distressing, perhaps of attacking,
      Constantinople, and of persuading the Barbarians of Europe to
      second his arms and counsels against the common enemy of mankind.

      Under the pretence of a Scythian war, he silently led his troops
      to the frontiers of Iberia; the Colchian guides were prepared to
      conduct them through the woods and along the precipices of Mount
      Caucasus; and a narrow path was laboriously formed into a safe
      and spacious highway, for the march of cavalry, and even of
      elephants. Gubazes laid his person and diadem at the feet of the
      king of Persia; his Colchians imitated the submission of their
      prince; and after the walls of Petra had been shaken, the Roman
      garrison prevented, by a capitulation, the impending fury of the
      last assault. But the Lazi soon discovered, that their impatience
      had urged them to choose an evil more intolerable than the
      calamities which they strove to escape. The monopoly of salt and
      corn was effectually removed by the loss of those valuable
      commodities. The authority of a Roman legislator, was succeeded
      by the pride of an Oriental despot, who beheld, with equal
      disdain, the slaves whom he had exalted, and the kings whom he
      had humbled before the footstool of his throne. The adoration of
      fire was introduced into Colchos by the zeal of the Magi: their
      intolerant spirit provoked the fervor of a Christian people; and
      the prejudice of nature or education was wounded by the impious
      practice of exposing the dead bodies of their parents, on the
      summit of a lofty tower, to the crows and vultures of the air. 85
      Conscious of the increasing hatred, which retarded the execution
      of his great designs, the just Nashirvan had secretly given
      orders to assassinate the king of the Lazi, to transplant the
      people into some distant land, and to fix a faithful and warlike
      colony on the banks of the Phasis. The watchful jealousy of the
      Colchians foresaw and averted the approaching ruin. Their
      repentance was accepted at Constantinople by the prudence, rather
      than clemency, of Justinian; and he commanded Dagisteus, with
      seven thousand Romans, and one thousand of the Zani, 8511 to
      expel the Persians from the coast of the Euxine.

      The siege of Petra, which the Roman general, with the aid of the
      Lazi, immediately undertook, is one of the most remarkable
      actions of the age. The city was seated on a craggy rock, which
      hung over the sea, and communicated by a steep and narrow path
      with the land. Since the approach was difficult, the attack might
      be deemed impossible: the Persian conqueror had strengthened the
      fortifications of Justinian; and the places least inaccessible
      were covered by additional bulwarks. In this important fortress,
      the vigilance of Chosroes had deposited a magazine of offensive
      and defensive arms, sufficient for five times the number, not
      only of the garrison, but of the besiegers themselves. The stock
      of flour and salt provisions was adequate to the consumption of
      five years; the want of wine was supplied by vinegar; and of
      grain from whence a strong liquor was extracted, and a triple
      aqueduct eluded the diligence, and even the suspicions, of the
      enemy. But the firmest defence of Petra was placed in the valor
      of fifteen hundred Persians, who resisted the assaults of the
      Romans, whilst, in a softer vein of earth, a mine was secretly
      perforated. The wall, supported by slender and temporary props,
      hung tottering in the air; but Dagisteus delayed the attack till
      he had secured a specific recompense; and the town was relieved
      before the return of his messenger from Constantinople. The
      Persian garrison was reduced to four hundred men, of whom no more
      than fifty were exempt from sickness or wounds; yet such had been
      their inflexible perseverance, that they concealed their losses
      from the enemy, by enduring, without a murmur, the sight and
      putrefying stench of the dead bodies of their eleven hundred
      companions. After their deliverance, the breaches were hastily
      stopped with sand-bags; the mine was replenished with earth; a
      new wall was erected on a frame of substantial timber; and a
      fresh garrison of three thousand men was stationed at Petra to
      sustain the labors of a second siege. The operations, both of the
      attack and defence, were conducted with skilful obstinacy; and
      each party derived useful lessons from the experience of their
      past faults. A battering-ram was invented, of light construction
      and powerful effect: it was transported and worked by the hands
      of forty soldiers; and as the stones were loosened by its
      repeated strokes, they were torn with long iron hooks from the
      wall. From those walls, a shower of darts was incessantly poured
      on the heads of the assailants; but they were most dangerously
      annoyed by a fiery composition of sulphur and bitumen, which in
      Colchos might with some propriety be named the oil of Medea. Of
      six thousand Romans who mounted the scaling-ladders, their
      general Bessas was the first, a gallant veteran of seventy years
      of age: the courage of their leader, his fall, and extreme
      danger, animated the irresistible effort of his troops; and their
      prevailing numbers oppressed the strength, without subduing the
      spirit, of the Persian garrison. The fate of these valiant men
      deserves to be more distinctly noticed. Seven hundred had
      perished in the siege, two thousand three hundred survived to
      defend the breach. One thousand and seventy were destroyed with
      fire and sword in the last assault; and if seven hundred and
      thirty were made prisoners, only eighteen among them were found
      without the marks of honorable wounds. The remaining five hundred
      escaped into the citadel, which they maintained without any hopes
      of relief, rejecting the fairest terms of capitulation and
      service, till they were lost in the flames. They died in
      obedience to the commands of their prince; and such examples of
      loyalty and valor might excite their countrymen to deeds of equal
      despair and more prosperous event. The instant demolition of the
      works of Petra confessed the astonishment and apprehension of the
      conqueror. A Spartan would have praised and pitied the virtue of
      these heroic slaves; but the tedious warfare and alternate
      success of the Roman and Persian arms cannot detain the attention
      of posterity at the foot of Mount Caucasus. The advantages
      obtained by the troops of Justinian were more frequent and
      splendid; but the forces of the great king were continually
      supplied, till they amounted to eight elephants and seventy
      thousand men, including twelve thousand Scythian allies, and
      above three thousand Dilemites, who descended by their free
      choice from the hills of Hyrcania, and were equally formidable in
      close or in distant combat. The siege of Archaeopolis, a name
      imposed or corrupted by the Greeks, was raised with some loss and
      precipitation; but the Persians occupied the passes of Iberia:
      Colchos was enslaved by their forts and garrisons; they devoured
      the scanty sustenance of the people; and the prince of the Lazi
      fled into the mountains. In the Roman camp, faith and discipline
      were unknown; and the independent leaders, who were invested with
      equal power, disputed with each other the preeminence of vice and
      corruption. The Persians followed, without a murmur, the commands
      of a single chief, who implicitly obeyed the instructions of
      their supreme lord. Their general was distinguished among the
      heroes of the East by his wisdom in council, and his valor in the
      field. The advanced age of Mermeroes, and the lameness of both
      his feet, could not diminish the activity of his mind, or even of
      his body; and, whilst he was carried in a litter in the front of
      battle, he inspired terror to the enemy, and a just confidence to
      the troops, who, under his banners, were always successful. After
      his death, the command devolved to Nacoragan, a proud satrap,
      who, in a conference with the Imperial chiefs, had presumed to
      declare that he disposed of victory as absolutely as of the ring
      on his finger. Such presumption was the natural cause and
      forerunner of a shameful defeat. The Romans had been gradually
      repulsed to the edge of the sea-shore; and their last camp, on
      the ruins of the Grecian colony of Phasis, was defended on all
      sides by strong intrenchments, the river, the Euxine, and a fleet
      of galleys. Despair united their counsels and invigorated their
      arms: they withstood the assault of the Persians and the flight
      of Nacoragan preceded or followed the slaughter of ten thousand
      of his bravest soldiers. He escaped from the Romans to fall into
      the hands of an unforgiving master who severely chastised the
      error of his own choice: the unfortunate general was flayed
      alive, and his skin, stuffed into the human form, was exposed on
      a mountain; a dreadful warning to those who might hereafter be
      intrusted with the fame and fortune of Persia. 86 Yet the
      prudence of Chosroes insensibly relinquished the prosecution of
      the Colchian war, in the just persuasion, that it is impossible
      to reduce, or, at least, to hold a distant country against the
      wishes and efforts of its inhabitants. The fidelity of Gubazes
      sustained the most rigorous trials. He patiently endured the
      hardships of a savage life, and rejected with disdain, the
      specious temptations of the Persian court. 8611 The king of the
      Lazi had been educated in the Christian religion; his mother was
      the daughter of a senator; during his youth he had served ten
      years a silentiary of the Byzantine palace, 87 and the arrears of
      an unpaid salary were a motive of attachment as well as of
      complaint. But the long continuance of his sufferings extorted
      from him a naked representation of the truth; and truth was an
      unpardonable libel on the lieutenants of Justinian, who, amidst
      the delays of a ruinous war, had spared his enemies and trampled
      on his allies. Their malicious information persuaded the emperor
      that his faithless vassal already meditated a second defection:
      an order was surprised to send him prisoner to Constantinople; a
      treacherous clause was inserted, that he might be lawfully killed
      in case of resistance; and Gubazes, without arms, or suspicion of
      danger, was stabbed in the security of a friendly interview. In
      the first moments of rage and despair, the Colchians would have
      sacrificed their country and religion to the gratification of
      revenge. But the authority and eloquence of the wiser few
      obtained a salutary pause: the victory of the Phasis restored the
      terror of the Roman arms, and the emperor was solicitous to
      absolve his own name from the imputation of so foul a murder. A
      judge of senatorial rank was commissioned to inquire into the
      conduct and death of the king of the Lazi. He ascended a stately
      tribunal, encompassed by the ministers of justice and punishment:
      in the presence of both nations, this extraordinary cause was
      pleaded, according to the forms of civil jurisprudence, and some
      satisfaction was granted to an injured people, by the sentence
      and execution of the meaner criminals. 88

      In peace, the king of Persia continually sought the pretences of
      a rupture: but no sooner had he taken up arms, than he expressed
      his desire of a safe and honorable treaty. During the fiercest
      hostilities, the two monarchs entertained a deceitful
      negotiation; and such was the superiority of Chosroes, that
      whilst he treated the Roman ministers with insolence and
      contempt, he obtained the most unprecedented honors for his own
      ambassadors at the Imperial court. The successor of Cyrus assumed
      the majesty of the Eastern sun, and graciously permitted his
      younger brother Justinian to reign over the West, with the pale
      and reflected splendor of the moon. This gigantic style was
      supported by the pomp and eloquence of Isdigune, one of the royal
      chamberlains. His wife and daughters, with a train of eunuchs and
      camels, attended the march of the ambassador: two satraps with
      golden diadems were numbered among his followers: he was guarded
      by five hundred horse, the most valiant of the Persians; and the
      Roman governor of Dara wisely refused to admit more than twenty
      of this martial and hostile caravan. When Isdigune had saluted
      the emperor, and delivered his presents, he passed ten months at
      Constantinople without discussing any serious affairs. Instead of
      being confined to his palace, and receiving food and water from
      the hands of his keepers, the Persian ambassador, without spies
      or guards, was allowed to visit the capital; and the freedom of
      conversation and trade enjoyed by his domestics, offended the
      prejudices of an age which rigorously practised the law of
      nations, without confidence or courtesy. 89 By an unexampled
      indulgence, his interpreter, a servant below the notice of a
      Roman magistrate, was seated, at the table of Justinian, by the
      side of his master: and one thousand pounds of gold might be
      assigned for the expense of his journey and entertainment. Yet
      the repeated labors of Isdigune could procure only a partial and
      imperfect truce, which was always purchased with the treasures,
      and renewed at the solicitation, of the Byzantine court Many
      years of fruitless desolation elapsed before Justinian and
      Chosroes were compelled, by mutual lassitude, to consult the
      repose of their declining age. At a conference held on the
      frontier, each party, without expecting to gain credit, displayed
      the power, the justice, and the pacific intentions, of their
      respective sovereigns; but necessity and interest dictated the
      treaty of peace, which was concluded for a term of fifty years,
      diligently composed in the Greek and Persian languages, and
      attested by the seals of twelve interpreters. The liberty of
      commerce and religion was fixed and defined; the allies of the
      emperor and the great king were included in the same benefits and
      obligations; and the most scrupulous precautions were provided to
      prevent or determine the accidental disputes that might arise on
      the confines of two hostile nations. After twenty years of
      destructive though feeble war, the limits still remained without
      alteration; and Chosroes was persuaded to renounce his dangerous
      claim to the possession or sovereignty of Colchos and its
      dependent states. Rich in the accumulated treasures of the East,
      he extorted from the Romans an annual payment of thirty thousand
      pieces of gold; and the smallness of the sum revealed the
      disgrace of a tribute in its naked deformity. In a previous
      debate, the chariot of Sesostris, and the wheel of fortune, were
      applied by one of the ministers of Justinian, who observed that
      the reduction of Antioch, and some Syrian cities, had elevated
      beyond measure the vain and ambitious spirit of the Barbarian.
      “You are mistaken,” replied the modest Persian: “the king of
      kings, the lord of mankind, looks down with contempt on such
      petty acquisitions; and of the ten nations, vanquished by his
      invincible arms, he esteems the Romans as the least formidable.”
      90 According to the Orientals, the empire of Nushirvan extended
      from Ferganah, in Transoxiana, to Yemen or Arabia Faelix. He
      subdued the rebels of Hyrcania, reduced the provinces of Cabul
      and Zablestan on the banks of the Indus, broke the power of the
      Euthalites, terminated by an honorable treaty the Turkish war,
      and admitted the daughter of the great khan into the number of
      his lawful wives. Victorious and respected among the princes of
      Asia, he gave audience, in his palace of Madain, or Ctesiphon, to
      the ambassadors of the world. Their gifts or tributes, arms, rich
      garments, gems, slaves or aromatics, were humbly presented at the
      foot of his throne; and he condescended to accept from the king
      of India ten quintals of the wood of aloes, a maid seven cubits
      in height, and a carpet softer than silk, the skin, as it was
      reported, of an extraordinary serpent. 91

      Justinian had been reproached for his alliance with the
      Aethiopians, as if he attempted to introduce a people of savage
      negroes into the system of civilized society. But the friends of
      the Roman empire, the Axumites, or Abyssinians, may be always
      distinguished from the original natives of Africa. 92 The hand of
      nature has flattened the noses of the negroes, covered their
      heads with shaggy wool, and tinged their skin with inherent and
      indelible blackness. But the olive complexion of the Abyssinians,
      their hair, shape, and features, distinctly mark them as a colony
      of Arabs; and this descent is confirmed by the resemblance of
      language and manners the report of an ancient emigration, and the
      narrow interval between the shores of the Red Sea. Christianity
      had raised that nation above the level of African barbarism: 93
      their intercourse with Egypt, and the successors of Constantine,
      94 had communicated the rudiments of the arts and sciences; their
      vessels traded to the Isle of Ceylon, 95 and seven kingdoms
      obeyed the Negus or supreme prince of Abyssinia. The independence
      of the Homerites, 9511 who reigned in the rich and happy Arabia,
      was first violated by an Aethiopian conqueror: he drew his
      hereditary claim from the queen of Sheba, 96 and his ambition was
      sanctified by religious zeal. The Jews, powerful and active in
      exile, had seduced the mind of Dunaan, prince of the Homerites.
      They urged him to retaliate the persecution inflicted by the
      Imperial laws on their unfortunate brethren: some Roman merchants
      were injuriously treated; and several Christians of Negra 97 were
      honored with the crown of martyrdom. 98 The churches of Arabia
      implored the protection of the Abyssinian monarch. The Negus
      passed the Red Sea with a fleet and army, deprived the Jewish
      proselyte of his kingdom and life, and extinguished a race of
      princes, who had ruled above two thousand years the sequestered
      region of myrrh and frankincense. The conqueror immediately
      announced the victory of the gospel, requested an orthodox
      patriarch, and so warmly professed his friendship to the Roman
      empire, that Justinian was flattered by the hope of diverting the
      silk trade through the channel of Abyssinia, and of exciting the
      forces of Arabia against the Persian king. Nonnosus, descended
      from a family of ambassadors, was named by the emperor to execute
      this important commission. He wisely declined the shorter, but
      more dangerous, road, through the sandy deserts of Nubia;
      ascended the Nile, embarked on the Red Sea, and safely landed at
      the African port of Adulis. From Adulis to the royal city of
      Axume is no more than fifty leagues, in a direct line; but the
      winding passes of the mountains detained the ambassador fifteen
      days; and as he traversed the forests, he saw, and vaguely
      computed, about five thousand wild elephants. The capital,
      according to his report, was large and populous; and the village
      of Axume is still conspicuous by the regal coronations, by the
      ruins of a Christian temple, and by sixteen or seventeen obelisks
      inscribed with Grecian characters. 99 But the Negus 9911 gave
      audience in the open field, seated on a lofty chariot, which was
      drawn by four elephants, superbly caparisoned, and surrounded by
      his nobles and musicians. He was clad in a linen garment and cap,
      holding in his hand two javelins and a light shield; and,
      although his nakedness was imperfectly covered, he displayed the
      Barbaric pomp of gold chains, collars, and bracelets, richly
      adorned with pearls and precious stones. The ambassador of
      Justinian knelt; the Negus raised him from the ground, embraced
      Nonnosus, kissed the seal, perused the letter, accepted the Roman
      alliance, and, brandishing his weapons, denounced implacable war
      against the worshipers of fire. But the proposal of the silk
      trade was eluded; and notwithstanding the assurances, and perhaps
      the wishes, of the Abyssinians, these hostile menaces evaporated
      without effect. The Homerites were unwilling to abandon their
      aromatic groves, to explore a sandy desert, and to encounter,
      after all their fatigues, a formidable nation from whom they had
      never received any personal injuries. Instead of enlarging his
      conquests, the king of Aethiopia was incapable of defending his
      possessions. Abrahah, 9912 the slave of a Roman merchant of
      Adulis, assumed the sceptre of the Homerites,; the troops of
      Africa were seduced by the luxury of the climate; and Justinian
      solicited the friendship of the usurper, who honored with a
      slight tribute the supremacy of his prince. After a long series
      of prosperity, the power of Abrahah was overthrown before the
      gates of Mecca; and his children were despoiled by the Persian
      conqueror; and the Aethiopians were finally expelled from the
      continent of Asia. This narrative of obscure and remote events is
      not foreign to the decline and fall of the Roman empire. If a
      Christian power had been maintained in Arabia, Mahomet must have
      been crushed in his cradle, and Abyssinia would have prevented a
      revolution which has changed the civil and religious state of the
      world. 100 1001

      with obscure diligence, by Basnage, (Hist. des Juifs, tom. viii.
      l. xii. c. ii. p. 333—348,) who investigates the state of the
      Jews in Arabia and Aethiopia. * Note: According to Johannsen,
      (Hist. Yemanae, Praef. p. 89,) Dunaan (Ds Nowas) massacred 20,000
      Christians, and threw them into a pit, where they were burned.
      They are called in the Koran the companions of the pit (socii
      foveae.)—M.]

      99 (return) [ Alvarez (in Ramusio, tom. i. fol. 219, vers. 221,
      vers.) saw the flourishing state of Axume in the year
      1520—luogomolto buono e grande. It was ruined in the same century
      by the Turkish invasion. No more than 100 houses remain; but the
      memory of its past greatness is preserved by the regal
      coronation, (Ludolph. Hist. et Comment. l. ii. c. 11.) * Note:
      Lord Valentia’s and Mr. Salt’s Travels give a high notion of the
      ruins of Axum.—M.]

      9911 (return) [ The Negus is differently called Elesbaan,
      Elesboas, Elisthaeus, probably the same name, or rather
      appellation. See St. Martin, vol. viii. p. 49.—M.]

      9912 (return) [ According to the Arabian authorities, (Johannsen,
      Hist. Yemanae, p. 94, Bonn, 1828,) Abrahah was an Abyssinian, the
      rival of Ariathus, the brother of the Abyssinian king: he
      surprised and slew Ariathus, and by his craft appeased the
      resentment of Nadjash, the Abyssinian king. Abrahah was a
      Christian; he built a magnificent church at Sana, and dissuaded
      his subjects from their accustomed pilgrimages to Mecca. The
      church was defiled, it was supposed, by the Koreishites, and
      Abrahah took up arms to revenge himself on the temple at Mecca.
      He was repelled by miracle: his elephant would not advance, but
      knelt down before the sacred place; Abrahah fled, discomfited and
      mortally wounded, to Sana—M.]

      100 (return) [ The revolutions of Yemen in the sixth century must
      be collected from Procopius, (Persic. l. i. c. 19, 20,)
      Theophanes Byzant., (apud Phot. cod. lxiii. p. 80,) St.
      Theophanes, (in Chronograph. p. 144, 145, 188, 189, 206, 207, who
      is full of strange blunders,) Pocock, (Specimen Hist. Arab. p.
      62, 65,) D’Herbelot, (Bibliot. Orientale, p. 12, 477,) and Sale’s
      Preliminary Discourse and Koran, (c. 105.) The revolt of Abrahah
      is mentioned by Procopius; and his fall, though clouded with
      miracles, is an historical fact. Note: To the authors who have
      illustrated the obscure history of the Jewish and Abyssinian
      kingdoms in Homeritis may be added Schultens, Hist. Joctanidarum;
      Walch, Historia rerum in Homerite gestarum, in the 4th vol. of
      the Gottingen Transactions; Salt’s Travels, vol. ii. p. 446, &c.:
      Sylvestre de Sacy, vol. i. Acad. des Inscrip. Jost, Geschichte
      der Israeliter; Johannsen, Hist. Yemanae; St. Martin’s notes to
      Le Beau, t. vii p. 42.—M.]

      1001 (return) [ A period of sixty-seven years is assigned by most
      of the Arabian authorities to the Abyssinian kingdoms in
      Homeritis.—M.]
