Chapter XXVII: Civil Wars, Reign Of Theodosius.—Part I.

     Death Of Gratian.—Ruin Of Arianism.—St. Ambrose.—First Civil War,
     Against Maximus.—Character, Administration, And Penance Of
     Theodosius.—Death Of Valentinian II.—Second Civil War, Against
     Eugenius.—Death Of Theodosius.

      The fame of Gratian, before he had accomplished the twentieth
      year of his age, was equal to that of the most celebrated
      princes. His gentle and amiable disposition endeared him to his
      private friends, the graceful affability of his manners engaged
      the affection of the people: the men of letters, who enjoyed the
      liberality, acknowledged the taste and eloquence, of their
      sovereign; his valor and dexterity in arms were equally applauded
      by the soldiers; and the clergy considered the humble piety of
      Gratian as the first and most useful of his virtues. The victory
      of Colmar had delivered the West from a formidable invasion; and
      the grateful provinces of the East ascribed the merits of
      Theodosius to the author of his greatness, and of the public
      safety. Gratian survived those memorable events only four or five
      years; but he survived his reputation; and, before he fell a
      victim to rebellion, he had lost, in a great measure, the respect
      and confidence of the Roman world.

      The remarkable alteration of his character or conduct may not be
      imputed to the arts of flattery, which had besieged the son of
      Valentinian from his infancy; nor to the headstrong passions
      which the that gentle youth appears to have escaped. A more
      attentive view of the life of Gratian may perhaps suggest the
      true cause of the disappointment of the public hopes. His
      apparent virtues, instead of being the hardy productions of
      experience and adversity, were the premature and artificial
      fruits of a royal education. The anxious tenderness of his father
      was continually employed to bestow on him those advantages, which
      he might perhaps esteem the more highly, as he himself had been
      deprived of them; and the most skilful masters of every science,
      and of every art, had labored to form the mind and body of the
      young prince. 1 The knowledge which they painfully communicated
      was displayed with ostentation, and celebrated with lavish
      praise. His soft and tractable disposition received the fair
      impression of their judicious precepts, and the absence of
      passion might easily be mistaken for the strength of reason. His
      preceptors gradually rose to the rank and consequence of
      ministers of state: 2 and, as they wisely dissembled their secret
      authority, he seemed to act with firmness, with propriety, and
      with judgment, on the most important occasions of his life and
      reign. But the influence of this elaborate instruction did not
      penetrate beyond the surface; and the skilful preceptors, who so
      accurately guided the steps of their royal pupil, could not
      infuse into his feeble and indolent character the vigorous and
      independent principle of action which renders the laborious
      pursuit of glory essentially necessary to the happiness, and
      almost to the existence, of the hero. As soon as time and
      accident had removed those faithful counsellors from the throne,
      the emperor of the West insensibly descended to the level of his
      natural genius; abandoned the reins of government to the
      ambitious hands which were stretched forwards to grasp them; and
      amused his leisure with the most frivolous gratifications. A
      public sale of favor and injustice was instituted, both in the
      court and in the provinces, by the worthless delegates of his
      power, whose merit it was made sacrilege to question. 3 The
      conscience of the credulous prince was directed by saints and
      bishops; 4 who procured an Imperial edict to punish, as a capital
      offence, the violation, the neglect, or even the ignorance, of
      the divine law. 5 Among the various arts which had exercised the
      youth of Gratian, he had applied himself, with singular
      inclination and success, to manage the horse, to draw the bow,
      and to dart the javelin; and these qualifications, which might be
      useful to a soldier, were prostituted to the viler purposes of
      hunting. Large parks were enclosed for the Imperial pleasures,
      and plentifully stocked with every species of wild beasts; and
      Gratian neglected the duties, and even the dignity, of his rank,
      to consume whole days in the vain display of his dexterity and
      boldness in the chase. The pride and wish of the Roman emperor to
      excel in an art, in which he might be surpassed by the meanest of
      his slaves, reminded the numerous spectators of the examples of
      Nero and Commodus, but the chaste and temperate Gratian was a
      stranger to their monstrous vices; and his hands were stained
      only with the blood of animals. 6 The behavior of Gratian, which
      degraded his character in the eyes of mankind, could not have
      disturbed the security of his reign, if the army had not been
      provoked to resent their peculiar injuries. As long as the young
      emperor was guided by the instructions of his masters, he
      professed himself the friend and pupil of the soldiers; many of
      his hours were spent in the familiar conversation of the camp;
      and the health, the comforts, the rewards, the honors, of his
      faithful troops, appeared to be the objects of his attentive
      concern. But, after Gratian more freely indulged his prevailing
      taste for hunting and shooting, he naturally connected himself
      with the most dexterous ministers of his favorite amusement. A
      body of the Alani was received into the military and domestic
      service of the palace; and the admirable skill, which they were
      accustomed to display in the unbounded plains of Scythia, was
      exercised, on a more narrow theatre, in the parks and enclosures
      of Gaul. Gratian admired the talents and customs of these
      favorite guards, to whom alone he intrusted the defence of his
      person; and, as if he meant to insult the public opinion, he
      frequently showed himself to the soldiers and people, with the
      dress and arms, the long bow, the sounding quiver, and the fur
      garments of a Scythian warrior. The unworthy spectacle of a Roman
      prince, who had renounced the dress and manners of his country,
      filled the minds of the legions with grief and indignation. 7
      Even the Germans, so strong and formidable in the armies of the
      empire, affected to disdain the strange and horrid appearance of
      the savages of the North, who, in the space of a few years, had
      wandered from the banks of the Volga to those of the Seine. A
      loud and licentious murmur was echoed through the camps and
      garrisons of the West; and as the mild indolence of Gratian
      neglected to extinguish the first symptoms of discontent, the
      want of love and respect was not supplied by the influence of
      fear. But the subversion of an established government is always a
      work of some real, and of much apparent, difficulty; and the
      throne of Gratian was protected by the sanctions of custom, law,
      religion, and the nice balance of the civil and military powers,
      which had been established by the policy of Constantine. It is
      not very important to inquire from what cause the revolt of
      Britain was produced. Accident is commonly the parent of
      disorder; the seeds of rebellion happened to fall on a soil which
      was supposed to be more fruitful than any other in tyrants and
      usurpers; 8 the legions of that sequestered island had been long
      famous for a spirit of presumption and arrogance; 9 and the name
      of Maximus was proclaimed, by the tumultuary, but unanimous
      voice, both of the soldiers and of the provincials. The emperor,
      or the rebel,—for this title was not yet ascertained by
      fortune,—was a native of Spain, the countryman, the
      fellow-soldier, and the rival of Theodosius whose elevation he
      had not seen without some emotions of envy and resentment: the
      events of his life had long since fixed him in Britain; and I
      should not be unwilling to find some evidence for the marriage,
      which he is said to have contracted with the daughter of a
      wealthy lord of Caernarvonshire. 10 But this provincial rank
      might justly be considered as a state of exile and obscurity; and
      if Maximus had obtained any civil or military office, he was not
      invested with the authority either of governor or general. 11 His
      abilities, and even his integrity, are acknowledged by the
      partial writers of the age; and the merit must indeed have been
      conspicuous that could extort such a confession in favor of the
      vanquished enemy of Theodosius. The discontent of Maximus might
      incline him to censure the conduct of his sovereign, and to
      encourage, perhaps, without any views of ambition, the murmurs of
      the troops. But in the midst of the tumult, he artfully, or
      modestly, refused to ascend the throne; and some credit appears
      to have been given to his own positive declaration, that he was
      compelled to accept the dangerous present of the Imperial purple.

      his son; since he intrusted the education of Gratian to Ausonius,
      a professed Pagan. (Mem. de l’Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xv.

      his age.]

      2 (return) [ Ausonius was successively promoted to the Prætorian
      præfecture of Italy, (A.D. 377,) and of Gaul, (A.D. 378;) and
      was at length invested with the consulship, (A.D. 379.) He
      expressed his gratitude in a servile and insipid piece of
      flattery, (Actio Gratiarum, p. 699-736,) which has survived more
      worthy productions.]

      6 (return) [ Ammianus (xxxi. 10) and the younger Victor
      acknowledge the virtues of Gratian; and accuse, or rather lament,
      his degenerate taste. The odious parallel of Commodus is saved by
      “licet incruentus;” and perhaps Philostorgius (l. x. c. 10, and
      Godefroy, p. 41) had guarded with some similar reserve, the
      comparison of Nero.]

      8 (return) [ Britannia fertilis provincia tyrannorum, is a
      memorable expression, used by Jerom in the Pelagian controversy,
      and variously tortured in the disputes of our national
      antiquaries. The revolutions of the last age appeared to justify
      the image of the sublime Bossuet, “sette ile, plus orageuse que

      prudent reader may not perhaps be satisfied with such Welsh
      evidence.]

      11 (return) [ Camden (vol. i. introduct. p. ci.) appoints him
      governor at Britain; and the father of our antiquities is
      followed, as usual, by his blind progeny. Pacatus and Zosimus had
      taken some pains to prevent this error, or fable; and I shall
      protect myself by their decisive testimonies. Regali habitu
      exulem suum, illi exules orbis induerunt, (in Panegyr. Vet. xii.
      23,) and the Greek historian still less equivocally, (Maximus)
      (l. iv. p. 248.)]

      12 (return) [ Sulpicius Severus, Dialog. ii. 7. Orosius, l. vii.
      c. 34. p. 556. They both acknowledge (Sulpicius had been his
      subject) his innocence and merit. It is singular enough, that
      Maximus should be less favorably treated by Zosimus, the partial
      adversary of his rival.]

      But there was danger likewise in refusing the empire; and from
      the moment that Maximus had violated his allegiance to his lawful
      sovereign, he could not hope to reign, or even to live, if he
      confined his moderate ambition within the narrow limits of
      Britain. He boldly and wisely resolved to prevent the designs of
      Gratian; the youth of the island crowded to his standard, and he
      invaded Gaul with a fleet and army, which were long afterwards
      remembered, as the emigration of a considerable part of the
      British nation. 13 The emperor, in his peaceful residence of
      Paris, was alarmed by their hostile approach; and the darts which
      he idly wasted on lions and bears, might have been employed more
      honorably against the rebels. But his feeble efforts announced
      his degenerate spirit and desperate situation; and deprived him
      of the resources, which he still might have found, in the support
      of his subjects and allies. The armies of Gaul, instead of
      opposing the march of Maximus, received him with joyful and loyal
      acclamations; and the shame of the desertion was transferred from
      the people to the prince. The troops, whose station more
      immediately attached them to the service of the palace, abandoned
      the standard of Gratian the first time that it was displayed in
      the neighborhood of Paris. The emperor of the West fled towards
      Lyons, with a train of only three hundred horse; and, in the
      cities along the road, where he hoped to find refuge, or at least
      a passage, he was taught, by cruel experience, that every gate is
      shut against the unfortunate. Yet he might still have reached, in
      safety, the dominions of his brother; and soon have returned with
      the forces of Italy and the East; if he had not suffered himself
      to be fatally deceived by the perfidious governor of the Lyonnese
      province. Gratian was amused by protestations of doubtful
      fidelity, and the hopes of a support, which could not be
      effectual; till the arrival of Andragathius, the general of the
      cavalry of Maximus, put an end to his suspense. That resolute
      officer executed, without remorse, the orders or the intention of
      the usurper. Gratian, as he rose from supper, was delivered into
      the hands of the assassin: and his body was denied to the pious
      and pressing entreaties of his brother Valentinian. 14 The death
      of the emperor was followed by that of his powerful general
      Mellobaudes, the king of the Franks; who maintained, to the last
      moment of his life, the ambiguous reputation, which is the just
      recompense of obscure and subtle policy. 15 These executions
      might be necessary to the public safety: but the successful
      usurper, whose power was acknowledged by all the provinces of the
      West, had the merit, and the satisfaction, of boasting, that,
      except those who had perished by the chance of war, his triumph
      was not stained by the blood of the Romans. 16

      13 (return) [ Archbishop Usher (Antiquat. Britan. Eccles. p. 107,
      108) has diligently collected the legends of the island, and the
      continent. The whole emigration consisted of 30,000 soldiers, and
      100,000 plebeians, who settled in Bretagne. Their destined
      brides, St. Ursula with 11,000 noble, and 60,000 plebeian,
      virgins, mistook their way; landed at Cologne, and were all most
      cruelly murdered by the Huns. But the plebeian sisters have been
      defrauded of their equal honors; and what is still harder, John
      Trithemius presumes to mention the children of these British
      virgins.]

      14 (return) [ Zosimus (l. iv. p. 248, 249) has transported the
      death of Gratian from Lugdunum in Gaul (Lyons) to Singidunum in
      Moesia. Some hints may be extracted from the Chronicles; some
      lies may be detected in Sozomen (l. vii. c. 13) and Socrates, (l.
      v. c. 11.) Ambrose is our most authentic evidence, (tom. i.
      Enarrat. in Psalm lxi. p. 961, tom ii. epist. xxiv. p. 888 &c.,
      and de Obitu Valentinian Consolat. Ner. 28, p. 1182.)]

      15 (return) [ Pacatus (xii. 28) celebrates his fidelity; while
      his treachery is marked in Prosper’s Chronicle, as the cause of
      the ruin of Gratian. Ambrose, who has occasion to exculpate
      himself, only condemns the death of Vallio, a faithful servant of
      Gratian, (tom. ii. epist. xxiv. p. 891, edit. Benedict.) * Note:
      Le Beau contests the reading in the chronicle of Prosper upon
      which this charge rests. Le Beau, iv. 232.—M. * Note: According
      to Pacatus, the Count Vallio, who commanded the army, was carried
      to Chalons to be burnt alive; but Maximus, dreading the
      imputation of cruelty, caused him to be secretly strangled by his
      Bretons. Macedonius also, master of the offices, suffered the
      death which he merited. Le Beau, iv. 244.—M.]

      16 (return) [ He protested, nullum ex adversariis nisi in acissie
      occubu. Sulp. Jeverus in Vit. B. Martin, c. 23. The orator
      Theodosius bestows reluctant, and therefore weighty, praise on
      his clemency. Si cui ille, pro ceteris sceleribus suis, minus
      crudelis fuisse videtur, (Panegyr. Vet. xii. 28.)]

      The events of this revolution had passed in such rapid
      succession, that it would have been impossible for Theodosius to
      march to the relief of his benefactor, before he received the
      intelligence of his defeat and death. During the season of
      sincere grief, or ostentatious mourning, the Eastern emperor was
      interrupted by the arrival of the principal chamberlain of
      Maximus; and the choice of a venerable old man, for an office
      which was usually exercised by eunuchs, announced to the court of
      Constantinople the gravity and temperance of the British usurper.

      The ambassador condescended to justify, or excuse, the conduct of
      his master; and to protest, in specious language, that the murder
      of Gratian had been perpetrated, without his knowledge or
      consent, by the precipitate zeal of the soldiers. But he
      proceeded, in a firm and equal tone, to offer Theodosius the
      alternative of peace, or war. The speech of the ambassador
      concluded with a spirited declaration, that although Maximus, as
      a Roman, and as the father of his people, would choose rather to
      employ his forces in the common defence of the republic, he was
      armed and prepared, if his friendship should be rejected, to
      dispute, in a field of battle, the empire of the world. An
      immediate and peremptory answer was required; but it was
      extremely difficult for Theodosius to satisfy, on this important
      occasion, either the feelings of his own mind, or the
      expectations of the public. The imperious voice of honor and
      gratitude called aloud for revenge. From the liberality of
      Gratian, he had received the Imperial diadem; his patience would
      encourage the odious suspicion, that he was more deeply sensible
      of former injuries, than of recent obligations; and if he
      accepted the friendship, he must seem to share the guilt, of the
      assassin. Even the principles of justice, and the interest of
      society, would receive a fatal blow from the impunity of Maximus;
      and the example of successful usurpation would tend to dissolve
      the artificial fabric of government, and once more to replunge
      the empire in the crimes and calamities of the preceding age.
      But, as the sentiments of gratitude and honor should invariably
      regulate the conduct of an individual, they may be overbalanced
      in the mind of a sovereign, by the sense of superior duties; and
      the maxims both of justice and humanity must permit the escape of
      an atrocious criminal, if an innocent people would be involved in
      the consequences of his punishment. The assassin of Gratian had
      usurped, but he actually possessed, the most warlike provinces of
      the empire: the East was exhausted by the misfortunes, and even
      by the success, of the Gothic war; and it was seriously to be
      apprehended, that, after the vital strength of the republic had
      been wasted in a doubtful and destructive contest, the feeble
      conqueror would remain an easy prey to the Barbarians of the
      North. These weighty considerations engaged Theodosius to
      dissemble his resentment, and to accept the alliance of the
      tyrant. But he stipulated, that Maximus should content himself
      with the possession of the countries beyond the Alps. The brother
      of Gratian was confirmed and secured in the sovereignty of Italy,
      Africa, and the Western Illyricum; and some honorable conditions
      were inserted in the treaty, to protect the memory, and the laws,
      of the deceased emperor. 17 According to the custom of the age,
      the images of the three Imperial colleagues were exhibited to the
      veneration of the people; nor should it be lightly supposed,
      that, in the moment of a solemn reconciliation, Theodosius
      secretly cherished the intention of perfidy and revenge. 18

      17 (return) [ Ambrose mentions the laws of Gratian, quas non
      abrogavit hostia (tom. ii epist. xvii. p. 827.)]

      18 (return) [ Zosimus, l. iv. p. 251, 252. We may disclaim his
      odious suspicions; but we cannot reject the treaty of peace which
      the friends of Theodosius have absolutely forgotten, or slightly
      mentioned.]

      The contempt of Gratian for the Roman soldiers had exposed him to
      the fatal effects of their resentment. His profound veneration
      for the Christian clergy was rewarded by the applause and
      gratitude of a powerful order, which has claimed, in every age,
      the privilege of dispensing honors, both on earth and in heaven.
      19 The orthodox bishops bewailed his death, and their own
      irreparable loss; but they were soon comforted by the discovery,
      that Gratian had committed the sceptre of the East to the hands
      of a prince, whose humble faith and fervent zeal, were supported
      by the spirit and abilities of a more vigorous character. Among
      the benefactors of the church, the fame of Constantine has been
      rivalled by the glory of Theodosius. If Constantine had the
      advantage of erecting the standard of the cross, the emulation of
      his successor assumed the merit of subduing the Arian heresy, and
      of abolishing the worship of idols in the Roman world. Theodosius
      was the first of the emperors baptized in the true faith of the
      Trinity. Although he was born of a Christian family, the maxims,
      or at least the practice, of the age, encouraged him to delay the
      ceremony of his initiation; till he was admonished of the danger
      of delay, by the serious illness which threatened his life,
      towards the end of the first year of his reign. Before he again
      took the field against the Goths, he received the sacrament of
      baptism 20 from Acholius, the orthodox bishop of Thessalonica: 21
      and, as the emperor ascended from the holy font, still glowing
      with the warm feelings of regeneration, he dictated a solemn
      edict, which proclaimed his own faith, and prescribed the
      religion of his subjects. “It is our pleasure (such is the
      Imperial style) that all the nations, which are governed by our
      clemency and moderation, should steadfastly adhere to the
      religion which was taught by St. Peter to the Romans; which
      faithful tradition has preserved; and which is now professed by
      the pontiff Damasus, and by Peter, bishop of Alexandria, a man of
      apostolic holiness. According to the discipline of the apostles,
      and the doctrine of the gospel, let us believe the sole deity of
      the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost; under an equal majesty,
      and a pious Trinity. We authorize the followers of this doctrine
      to assume the title of Catholic Christians; and as we judge, that
      all others are extravagant madmen, we brand them with the
      infamous name of Heretics; and declare that their conventicles
      shall no longer usurp the respectable appellation of churches.
      Besides the condemnation of divine justice, they must expect to
      suffer the severe penalties, which our authority, guided by
      heavenly wisdom, shall think proper to inflict upon them.” 22 The
      faith of a soldier is commonly the fruit of instruction, rather
      than of inquiry; but as the emperor always fixed his eyes on the
      visible landmarks of orthodoxy, which he had so prudently
      constituted, his religious opinions were never affected by the
      specious texts, the subtle arguments, and the ambiguous creeds of
      the Arian doctors. Once indeed he expressed a faint inclination
      to converse with the eloquent and learned Eunomius, who lived in
      retirement at a small distance from Constantinople. But the
      dangerous interview was prevented by the prayers of the empress
      Flaccilla, who trembled for the salvation of her husband; and the
      mind of Theodosius was confirmed by a theological argument,
      adapted to the rudest capacity. He had lately bestowed on his
      eldest son, Arcadius, the name and honors of Augustus, and the
      two princes were seated on a stately throne to receive the homage
      of their subjects. A bishop, Amphilochius of Iconium, approached
      the throne, and after saluting, with due reverence, the person of
      his sovereign, he accosted the royal youth with the same familiar
      tenderness which he might have used towards a plebeian child.
      Provoked by this insolent behavior, the monarch gave orders, that
      the rustic priest should be instantly driven from his presence.
      But while the guards were forcing him to the door, the dexterous
      polemic had time to execute his design, by exclaiming, with a
      loud voice, “Such is the treatment, O emperor! which the King of
      heaven has prepared for those impious men, who affect to worship
      the Father, but refuse to acknowledge the equal majesty of his
      divine Son.” Theodosius immediately embraced the bishop of
      Iconium, and never forgot the important lesson, which he had
      received from this dramatic parable. 23

      Chapter XXVII: Civil Wars, Reign Of Theodosius.—Part II.

      Constantinople was the principal seat and fortress of Arianism;
      and, in a long interval of forty years, 24 the faith of the
      princes and prelates, who reigned in the capital of the East, was
      rejected in the purer schools of Rome and Alexandria. The
      archiepiscopal throne of Macedonius, which had been polluted with
      so much Christian blood, was successively filled by Eudoxus and
      Damophilus. Their diocese enjoyed a free importation of vice and
      error from every province of the empire; the eager pursuit of
      religious controversy afforded a new occupation to the busy
      idleness of the metropolis; and we may credit the assertion of an
      intelligent observer, who describes, with some pleasantry, the
      effects of their loquacious zeal. “This city,” says he, “is full
      of mechanics and slaves, who are all of them profound
      theologians; and preach in the shops, and in the streets. If you
      desire a man to change a piece of silver, he informs you, wherein
      the Son differs from the Father; if you ask the price of a loaf,
      you are told by way of reply, that the Son is inferior to the
      Father; and if you inquire, whether the bath is ready, the answer
      is, that the Son was made out of nothing.” 25 The heretics, of
      various denominations, subsisted in peace under the protection of
      the Arians of Constantinople; who endeavored to secure the
      attachment of those obscure sectaries, while they abused, with
      unrelenting severity, the victory which they had obtained over
      the followers of the council of Nice. During the partial reigns
      of Constantius and Valens, the feeble remnant of the Homoousians
      was deprived of the public and private exercise of their
      religion; and it has been observed, in pathetic language, that
      the scattered flock was left without a shepherd to wander on the
      mountains, or to be devoured by rapacious wolves. 26 But, as
      their zeal, instead of being subdued, derived strength and vigor
      from oppression, they seized the first moments of imperfect
      freedom, which they had acquired by the death of Valens, to form
      themselves into a regular congregation, under the conduct of an
      episcopal pastor. Two natives of Cappadocia, Basil, and Gregory
      Nazianzen, 27 were distinguished above all their contemporaries,
      28 by the rare union of profane eloquence and of orthodox piety.

      These orators, who might sometimes be compared, by themselves,
      and by the public, to the most celebrated of the ancient Greeks,
      were united by the ties of the strictest friendship. They had
      cultivated, with equal ardor, the same liberal studies in the
      schools of Athens; they had retired, with equal devotion, to the
      same solitude in the deserts of Pontus; and every spark of
      emulation, or envy, appeared to be totally extinguished in the
      holy and ingenuous breasts of Gregory and Basil. But the
      exaltation of Basil, from a private life to the archiepiscopal
      throne of Caesarea, discovered to the world, and perhaps to
      himself, the pride of his character; and the first favor which he
      condescended to bestow on his friend, was received, and perhaps
      was intended, as a cruel insult. 29 Instead of employing the
      superior talents of Gregory in some useful and conspicuous
      station, the haughty prelate selected, among the fifty bishoprics
      of his extensive province, the wretched village of Sasima, 30
      without water, without verdure, without society, situate at the
      junction of three highways, and frequented only by the incessant
      passage of rude and clamorous wagoners. Gregory submitted with
      reluctance to this humiliating exile; he was ordained bishop of
      Sasima; but he solemnly protests, that he never consummated his
      spiritual marriage with this disgusting bride. He afterwards
      consented to undertake the government of his native church of
      Nazianzus, 31 of which his father had been bishop above
      five-and-forty years. But as he was still conscious that he
      deserved another audience, and another theatre, he accepted, with
      no unworthy ambition, the honorable invitation, which was
      addressed to him from the orthodox party of Constantinople. On
      his arrival in the capital, Gregory was entertained in the house
      of a pious and charitable kinsman; the most spacious room was
      consecrated to the uses of religious worship; and the name of
      Anastasia was chosen to express the resurrection of the Nicene
      faith. This private conventicle was afterwards converted into a
      magnificent church; and the credulity of the succeeding age was
      prepared to believe the miracles and visions, which attested the
      presence, or at least the protection, of the Mother of God. 32
      The pulpit of the Anastasia was the scene of the labors and
      triumphs of Gregory Nazianzen; and, in the space of two years, he
      experienced all the spiritual adventures which constitute the
      prosperous or adverse fortunes of a missionary. 33 The Arians,
      who were provoked by the boldness of his enterprise, represented
      his doctrine, as if he had preached three distinct and equal
      Deities; and the devout populace was excited to suppress, by
      violence and tumult, the irregular assemblies of the Athanasian
      heretics. From the cathedral of St. Sophia there issued a motley
      crowd “of common beggars, who had forfeited their claim to pity;
      of monks, who had the appearance of goats or satyrs; and of
      women, more terrible than so many Jezebels.” The doors of the
      Anastasia were broke open; much mischief was perpetrated, or
      attempted, with sticks, stones, and firebrands; and as a man lost
      his life in the affray, Gregory, who was summoned the next
      morning before the magistrate, had the satisfaction of supposing,
      that he publicly confessed the name of Christ. After he was
      delivered from the fear and danger of a foreign enemy, his infant
      church was disgraced and distracted by intestine faction. A
      stranger who assumed the name of Maximus, 34 and the cloak of a
      Cynic philosopher, insinuated himself into the confidence of
      Gregory; deceived and abused his favorable opinion; and forming a
      secret connection with some bishops of Egypt, attempted, by a
      clandestine ordination, to supplant his patron in the episcopal
      seat of Constantinople. These mortifications might sometimes
      tempt the Cappadocian missionary to regret his obscure solitude.
      But his fatigues were rewarded by the daily increase of his fame
      and his congregation; and he enjoyed the pleasure of observing,
      that the greater part of his numerous audience retired from his
      sermons satisfied with the eloquence of the preacher, 35 or
      dissatisfied with the manifold imperfections of their faith and
      practice. 36

      The Catholics of Constantinople were animated with joyful
      confidence by the baptism and edict of Theodosius; and they
      impatiently waited the effects of his gracious promise. Their
      hopes were speedily accomplished; and the emperor, as soon as he
      had finished the operations of the campaign, made his public
      entry into the capital at the head of a victorious army. The next
      day after his arrival, he summoned Damophilus to his presence,
      and offered that Arian prelate the hard alternative of
      subscribing the Nicene creed, or of instantly resigning, to the
      orthodox believers, the use and possession of the episcopal
      palace, the cathedral of St. Sophia, and all the churches of
      Constantinople. The zeal of Damophilus, which in a Catholic saint
      would have been justly applauded, embraced, without hesitation, a
      life of poverty and exile, 37 and his removal was immediately
      followed by the purification of the Imperial city. The Arians
      might complain, with some appearance of justice, that an
      inconsiderable congregation of sectaries should usurp the hundred
      churches, which they were insufficient to fill; whilst the far
      greater part of the people was cruelly excluded from every place
      of religious worship. Theodosius was still inexorable; but as the
      angels who protected the Catholic cause were only visible to the
      eyes of faith, he prudently reenforced those heavenly legions
      with the more effectual aid of temporal and carnal weapons; and
      the church of St. Sophia was occupied by a large body of the
      Imperial guards. If the mind of Gregory was susceptible of pride,
      he must have felt a very lively satisfaction, when the emperor
      conducted him through the streets in solemn triumph; and, with
      his own hand, respectfully placed him on the archiepiscopal
      throne of Constantinople. But the saint (who had not subdued the
      imperfections of human virtue) was deeply affected by the
      mortifying consideration, that his entrance into the fold was
      that of a wolf, rather than of a shepherd; that the glittering
      arms which surrounded his person, were necessary for his safety;
      and that he alone was the object of the imprecations of a great
      party, whom, as men and citizens, it was impossible for him to
      despise. He beheld the innumerable multitude of either sex, and
      of every age, who crowded the streets, the windows, and the roofs
      of the houses; he heard the tumultuous voice of rage, grief,
      astonishment, and despair; and Gregory fairly confesses, that on
      the memorable day of his installation, the capital of the East
      wore the appearance of a city taken by storm, and in the hands of
      a Barbarian conqueror. 38 About six weeks afterwards, Theodosius
      declared his resolution of expelling from all the churches of his
      dominions the bishops and their clergy who should obstinately
      refuse to believe, or at least to profess, the doctrine of the
      council of Nice. His lieutenant, Sapor, was armed with the ample
      powers of a general law, a special commission, and a military
      force; 39 and this ecclesiastical revolution was conducted with
      so much discretion and vigor, that the religion of the emperor
      was established, without tumult or bloodshed, in all the
      provinces of the East. The writings of the Arians, if they had
      been permitted to exist, 40 would perhaps contain the lamentable
      story of the persecution, which afflicted the church under the
      reign of the impious Theodosius; and the sufferings of their holy
      confessors might claim the pity of the disinterested reader. Yet
      there is reason to imagine, that the violence of zeal and revenge
      was, in some measure, eluded by the want of resistance; and that,
      in their adversity, the Arians displayed much less firmness than
      had been exerted by the orthodox party under the reigns of
      Constantius and Valens. The moral character and conduct of the
      hostile sects appear to have been governed by the same common
      principles of nature and religion: but a very material
      circumstance may be discovered, which tended to distinguish the
      degrees of their theological faith. Both parties, in the schools,
      as well as in the temples, acknowledged and worshipped the divine
      majesty of Christ; and, as we are always prone to impute our own
      sentiments and passions to the Deity, it would be deemed more
      prudent and respectful to exaggerate, than to circumscribe, the
      adorable perfections of the Son of God. The disciple of
      Athanasius exulted in the proud confidence, that he had entitled
      himself to the divine favor; while the follower of Arius must
      have been tormented by the secret apprehension, that he was
      guilty, perhaps, of an unpardonable offence, by the scanty
      praise, and parsimonious honors, which he bestowed on the Judge
      of the World. The opinions of Arianism might satisfy a cold and
      speculative mind: but the doctrine of the Nicene creed, most
      powerfully recommended by the merits of faith and devotion, was
      much better adapted to become popular and successful in a
      believing age.

      judiciously removes from the reign of Gratian to that of
      Theodosius.]

      (l. ix. c. 19) the explosion of Damophilus. The Eunomian

      The hope, that truth and wisdom would be found in the assemblies
      of the orthodox clergy, induced the emperor to convene, at
      Constantinople, a synod of one hundred and fifty bishops, who
      proceeded, without much difficulty or delay, to complete the
      theological system which had been established in the council of
      Nice. The vehement disputes of the fourth century had been
      chiefly employed on the nature of the Son of God; and the various
      opinions which were embraced, concerning the Second, were
      extended and transferred, by a natural analogy, to the Third
      person of the Trinity. 41 Yet it was found, or it was thought,
      necessary, by the victorious adversaries of Arianism, to explain
      the ambiguous language of some respectable doctors; to confirm
      the faith of the Catholics; and to condemn an unpopular and
      inconsistent sect of Macedonians; who freely admitted that the
      Son was consubstantial to the Father, while they were fearful of
      seeming to acknowledge the existence of Three Gods. A final and
      unanimous sentence was pronounced to ratify the equal Deity of
      the Holy Ghost: the mysterious doctrine has been received by all
      the nations, and all the churches of the Christian world; and
      their grateful reverence has assigned to the bishops of
      Theodosius the second rank among the general councils. 42 Their
      knowledge of religious truth may have been preserved by
      tradition, or it may have been communicated by inspiration; but
      the sober evidence of history will not allow much weight to the
      personal authority of the Fathers of Constantinople. In an age
      when the ecclesiastics had scandalously degenerated from the
      model of apostolic purity, the most worthless and corrupt were
      always the most eager to frequent, and disturb, the episcopal
      assemblies. The conflict and fermentation of so many opposite
      interests and tempers inflamed the passions of the bishops: and
      their ruling passions were, the love of gold, and the love of
      dispute. Many of the same prelates who now applauded the orthodox
      piety of Theodosius, had repeatedly changed, with prudent
      flexibility, their creeds and opinions; and in the various
      revolutions of the church and state, the religion of their
      sovereign was the rule of their obsequious faith. When the
      emperor suspended his prevailing influence, the turbulent synod
      was blindly impelled by the absurd or selfish motives of pride,
      hatred, or resentment. The death of Meletius, which happened at
      the council of Constantinople, presented the most favorable
      opportunity of terminating the schism of Antioch, by suffering
      his aged rival, Paulinus, peaceably to end his days in the
      episcopal chair. The faith and virtues of Paulinus were
      unblemished. But his cause was supported by the Western churches;
      and the bishops of the synod resolved to perpetuate the mischiefs
      of discord, by the hasty ordination of a perjured candidate, 43
      rather than to betray the imagined dignity of the East, which had
      been illustrated by the birth and death of the Son of God. Such
      unjust and disorderly proceedings forced the gravest members of
      the assembly to dissent and to secede; and the clamorous majority
      which remained masters of the field of battle, could be compared
      only to wasps or magpies, to a flight of cranes, or to a flock of
      geese. 44

      deified the Father and the Son without the Holy Ghost, that they
      might as well be styled Tritheists as Ditheists. Gregory himself
      was almost a Tritheist; and his monarchy of heaven resembles a

      A suspicion may possibly arise, that so unfavorable a picture of
      ecclesiastical synods has been drawn by the partial hand of some
      obstinate heretic, or some malicious infidel. But the name of the
      sincere historian who has conveyed this instructive lesson to the
      knowledge of posterity, must silence the impotent murmurs of
      superstition and bigotry. He was one of the most pious and
      eloquent bishops of the age; a saint, and a doctor of the church;
      the scourge of Arianism, and the pillar of the orthodox faith; a
      distinguished member of the council of Constantinople, in which,
      after the death of Meletius, he exercised the functions of
      president; in a word—Gregory Nazianzen himself. The harsh and
      ungenerous treatment which he experienced, 45 instead of
      derogating from the truth of his evidence, affords an additional
      proof of the spirit which actuated the deliberations of the
      synod. Their unanimous suffrage had confirmed the pretensions
      which the bishop of Constantinople derived from the choice of the
      people, and the approbation of the emperor. But Gregory soon
      became the victim of malice and envy. The bishops of the East,
      his strenuous adherents, provoked by his moderation in the
      affairs of Antioch, abandoned him, without support, to the
      adverse faction of the Egyptians; who disputed the validity of
      his election, and rigorously asserted the obsolete canon, that
      prohibited the licentious practice of episcopal translations. The
      pride, or the humility, of Gregory prompted him to decline a
      contest which might have been imputed to ambition and avarice;
      and he publicly offered, not without some mixture of indignation,
      to renounce the government of a church which had been restored,
      and almost created, by his labors. His resignation was accepted
      by the synod, and by the emperor, with more readiness than he
      seems to have expected. At the time when he might have hoped to
      enjoy the fruits of his victory, his episcopal throne was filled
      by the senator Nectarius; and the new archbishop, accidentally
      recommended by his easy temper and venerable aspect, was obliged
      to delay the ceremony of his consecration, till he had previously
      despatched the rites of his baptism. 46 After this remarkable
      experience of the ingratitude of princes and prelates, Gregory
      retired once more to his obscure solitude of Cappadocia; where he
      employed the remainder of his life, about eight years, in the
      exercises of poetry and devotion. The title of Saint has been
      added to his name: but the tenderness of his heart, 47 and the
      elegance of his genius, reflect a more pleasing lustre on the
      memory of Gregory Nazianzen.

      natural temper when it was not hardened, or inflamed, by

      prosecute the heretics of Constantinople.]

      It was not enough that Theodosius had suppressed the insolent
      reign of Arianism, or that he had abundantly revenged the
      injuries which the Catholics sustained from the zeal of
      Constantius and Valens. The orthodox emperor considered every
      heretic as a rebel against the supreme powers of heaven and of
      earth; and each of those powers might exercise their peculiar
      jurisdiction over the soul and body of the guilty. The decrees of
      the council of Constantinople had ascertained the true standard
      of the faith; and the ecclesiastics, who governed the conscience
      of Theodosius, suggested the most effectual methods of
      persecution. In the space of fifteen years, he promulgated at
      least fifteen severe edicts against the heretics; 48 more
      especially against those who rejected the doctrine of the
      Trinity; and to deprive them of every hope of escape, he sternly
      enacted, that if any laws or rescripts should be alleged in their
      favor, the judges should consider them as the illegal productions
      either of fraud or forgery. The penal statutes were directed
      against the ministers, the assemblies, and the persons of the
      heretics; and the passions of the legislator were expressed in
      the language of declamation and invective. I. The heretical
      teachers, who usurped the sacred titles of Bishops, or
      Presbyters, were not only excluded from the privileges and
      emoluments so liberally granted to the orthodox clergy, but they
      were exposed to the heavy penalties of exile and confiscation, if
      they presumed to preach the doctrine, or to practise the rites,
      of their accursed sects. A fine of ten pounds of gold (above four
      hundred pounds sterling) was imposed on every person who should
      dare to confer, or receive, or promote, an heretical ordination:
      and it was reasonably expected, that if the race of pastors could
      be extinguished, their helpless flocks would be compelled, by
      ignorance and hunger, to return within the pale of the Catholic
      church. II. The rigorous prohibition of conventicles was
      carefully extended to every possible circumstance, in which the
      heretics could assemble with the intention of worshipping God and
      Christ according to the dictates of their conscience. Their
      religious meetings, whether public or secret, by day or by night,
      in cities or in the country, were equally proscribed by the
      edicts of Theodosius; and the building, or ground, which had been
      used for that illegal purpose, was forfeited to the Imperial
      domain. III. It was supposed, that the error of the heretics
      could proceed only from the obstinate temper of their minds; and
      that such a temper was a fit object of censure and punishment.
      The anathemas of the church were fortified by a sort of civil
      excommunication; which separated them from their fellow-citizens,
      by a peculiar brand of infamy; and this declaration of the
      supreme magistrate tended to justify, or at least to excuse, the
      insults of a fanatic populace. The sectaries were gradually
      disqualified from the possession of honorable or lucrative
      employments; and Theodosius was satisfied with his own justice,
      when he decreed, that, as the Eunomians distinguished the nature
      of the Son from that of the Father, they should be incapable of
      making their wills or of receiving any advantage from
      testamentary donations. The guilt of the Manichaean heresy was
      esteemed of such magnitude, that it could be expiated only by the
      death of the offender; and the same capital punishment was
      inflicted on the Audians, or Quartodecimans, 49 who should dare
      to perpetrate the atrocious crime of celebrating on an improper
      day the festival of Easter. Every Roman might exercise the right
      of public accusation; but the office of Inquisitors of the Faith,
      a name so deservedly abhorred, was first instituted under the
      reign of Theodosius. Yet we are assured, that the execution of
      his penal edicts was seldom enforced; and that the pious emperor
      appeared less desirous to punish, than to reclaim, or terrify,
      his refractory subjects. 50

      The theory of persecution was established by Theodosius, whose
      justice and piety have been applauded by the saints: but the
      practice of it, in the fullest extent, was reserved for his rival
      and colleague, Maximus, the first, among the Christian princes,
      who shed the blood of his Christian subjects on account of their
      religious opinions. The cause of the Priscillianists, 51 a recent
      sect of heretics, who disturbed the provinces of Spain, was
      transferred, by appeal, from the synod of Bordeaux to the
      Imperial consistory of Treves; and by the sentence of the
      Prætorian præfect, seven persons were tortured, condemned, and
      executed. The first of these was Priscillian 52 himself, bishop
      of Avila, in Spain; who adorned the advantages of birth and
      fortune, by the accomplishments of eloquence and learning. 53 Two
      presbyters, and two deacons, accompanied their beloved master in
      his death, which they esteemed as a glorious martyrdom; and the
      number of religious victims was completed by the execution of
      Latronian, a poet, who rivalled the fame of the ancients; and of
      Euchrocia, a noble matron of Bordeaux, the widow of the orator
      Delphidius. 54 Two bishops who had embraced the sentiments of
      Priscillian, were condemned to a distant and dreary exile; 55 and
      some indulgence was shown to the meaner criminals, who assumed
      the merit of an early repentance. If any credit could be allowed
      to confessions extorted by fear or pain, and to vague reports,
      the offspring of malice and credulity, the heresy of the
      Priscillianists would be found to include the various
      abominations of magic, of impiety, and of lewdness. 56
      Priscillian, who wandered about the world in the company of his
      spiritual sisters, was accused of praying stark naked in the
      midst of the congregation; and it was confidently asserted, that
      the effects of his criminal intercourse with the daughter of
      Euchrocia had been suppressed, by means still more odious and
      criminal. But an accurate, or rather a candid, inquiry will
      discover, that if the Priscillianists violated the laws of
      nature, it was not by the licentiousness, but by the austerity,
      of their lives. They absolutely condemned the use of the
      marriage-bed; and the peace of families was often disturbed by
      indiscreet separations. They enjoyed, or recommended, a total
      abstinence from all animal food; and their continual prayers,
      fasts, and vigils, inculcated a rule of strict and perfect
      devotion. The speculative tenets of the sect, concerning the
      person of Christ, and the nature of the human soul, were derived
      from the Gnostic and Manichaean system; and this vain philosophy,
      which had been transported from Egypt to Spain, was ill adapted
      to the grosser spirits of the West. The obscure disciples of
      Priscillian suffered languished, and gradually disappeared: his
      tenets were rejected by the clergy and people, but his death was
      the subject of a long and vehement controversy; while some
      arraigned, and others applauded, the justice of his sentence. It
      is with pleasure that we can observe the humane inconsistency of
      the most illustrious saints and bishops, Ambrose of Milan, 57 and
      Martin of Tours, 58 who, on this occasion, asserted the cause of
      toleration. They pitied the unhappy men, who had been executed at
      Treves; they refused to hold communion with their episcopal
      murderers; and if Martin deviated from that generous resolution,
      his motives were laudable, and his repentance was exemplary. The
      bishops of Tours and Milan pronounced, without hesitation, the
      eternal damnation of heretics; but they were surprised, and
      shocked, by the bloody image of their temporal death, and the
      honest feelings of nature resisted the artificial prejudices of
      theology. The humanity of Ambrose and Martin was confirmed by the
      scandalous irregularity of the proceedings against Priscillian
      and his adherents. The civil and ecclesiastical ministers had
      transgressed the limits of their respective provinces. The
      secular judge had presumed to receive an appeal, and to pronounce
      a definitive sentence, in a matter of faith, and episcopal
      jurisdiction. The bishops had disgraced themselves, by exercising
      the functions of accusers in a criminal prosecution. The cruelty
      of Ithacius, 59 who beheld the tortures, and solicited the death,
      of the heretics, provoked the just indignation of mankind; and
      the vices of that profligate bishop were admitted as a proof,
      that his zeal was instigated by the sordid motives of interest.
      Since the death of Priscillian, the rude attempts of persecution
      have been refined and methodized in the holy office, which
      assigns their distinct parts to the ecclesiastical and secular
      powers. The devoted victim is regularly delivered by the priest
      to the magistrate, and by the magistrate to the executioner; and
      the inexorable sentence of the church, which declares the
      spiritual guilt of the offender, is expressed in the mild
      language of pity and intercession.

      Chapter XXVII: Civil Wars, Reign Of Theodosius.—Part III.

      Among the ecclesiastics, who illustrated the reign of Theodosius,
      Gregory Nazianzen was distinguished by the talents of an eloquent
      preacher; the reputation of miraculous gifts added weight and
      dignity to the monastic virtues of Martin of Tours; 60 but the
      palm of episcopal vigor and ability was justly claimed by the
      intrepid Ambrose. 61 He was descended from a noble family of
      Romans; his father had exercised the important office of
      Prætorian præfect of Gaul; and the son, after passing through
      the studies of a liberal education, attained, in the regular
      gradation of civil honors, the station of consular of Liguria, a
      province which included the Imperial residence of Milan. At the
      age of thirty-four, and before he had received the sacrament of
      baptism, Ambrose, to his own surprise, and to that of the world,
      was suddenly transformed from a governor to an archbishop.
      Without the least mixture, as it is said, of art or intrigue, the
      whole body of the people unanimously saluted him with the
      episcopal title; the concord and perseverance of their
      acclamations were ascribed to a praeternatural impulse; and the
      reluctant magistrate was compelled to undertake a spiritual
      office, for which he was not prepared by the habits and
      occupations of his former life. But the active force of his
      genius soon qualified him to exercise, with zeal and prudence,
      the duties of his ecclesiastical jurisdiction; and while he
      cheerfully renounced the vain and splendid trappings of temporal
      greatness, he condescended, for the good of the church, to direct
      the conscience of the emperors, and to control the administration
      of the empire. Gratian loved and revered him as a father; and the
      elaborate treatise on the faith of the Trinity was designed for
      the instruction of the young prince. After his tragic death, at a
      time when the empress Justina trembled for her own safety, and
      for that of her son Valentinian, the archbishop of Milan was
      despatched, on two different embassies, to the court of Treves.
      He exercised, with equal firmness and dexterity, the powers of
      his spiritual and political characters; and perhaps contributed,
      by his authority and eloquence, to check the ambition of Maximus,
      and to protect the peace of Italy. 62 Ambrose had devoted his
      life, and his abilities, to the service of the church. Wealth was
      the object of his contempt; he had renounced his private
      patrimony; and he sold, without hesitation, the consecrated
      plate, for the redemption of captives. The clergy and people of
      Milan were attached to their archbishop; and he deserved the
      esteem, without soliciting the favor, or apprehending the
      displeasure, of his feeble sovereigns.

      am always astonished by this contrast.]

      p. 78-306) and the Benedictine editors (p. xxxi.—lxiii.) have
      labored with their usual diligence.]

      62 (return) [ Ambrose himself (tom. ii. Epist. xxiv. p. 888—891)
      gives the emperor a very spirited account of his own embassy.]

      The government of Italy, and of the young emperor, naturally
      devolved to his mother Justina, a woman of beauty and spirit, but
      who, in the midst of an orthodox people, had the misfortune of
      professing the Arian heresy, which she endeavored to instil into
      the mind of her son. Justina was persuaded, that a Roman emperor
      might claim, in his own dominions, the public exercise of his
      religion; and she proposed to the archbishop, as a moderate and
      reasonable concession, that he should resign the use of a single
      church, either in the city or the suburbs of Milan. But the
      conduct of Ambrose was governed by very different principles. 63
      The palaces of the earth might indeed belong to Caesar; but the
      churches were the houses of God; and, within the limits of his
      diocese, he himself, as the lawful successor of the apostles, was
      the only minister of God. The privileges of Christianity,
      temporal as well as spiritual, were confined to the true
      believers; and the mind of Ambrose was satisfied, that his own
      theological opinions were the standard of truth and orthodoxy.
      The archbishop, who refused to hold any conference, or
      negotiation, with the instruments of Satan, declared, with modest
      firmness, his resolution to die a martyr, rather than to yield to
      the impious sacrilege; and Justina, who resented the refusal as
      an act of insolence and rebellion, hastily determined to exert
      the Imperial prerogative of her son. As she desired to perform
      her public devotions on the approaching festival of Easter,
      Ambrose was ordered to appear before the council. He obeyed the
      summons with the respect of a faithful subject, but he was
      followed, without his consent, by an innumerable people; they
      pressed, with impetuous zeal, against the gates of the palace;
      and the affrighted ministers of Valentinian, instead of
      pronouncing a sentence of exile on the archbishop of Milan,
      humbly requested that he would interpose his authority, to
      protect the person of the emperor, and to restore the tranquility
      of the capital. But the promises which Ambrose received and
      communicated were soon violated by a perfidious court; and,
      during six of the most solemn days, which Christian piety had set
      apart for the exercise of religion, the city was agitated by the
      irregular convulsions of tumult and fanaticism. The officers of
      the household were directed to prepare, first, the Portian, and
      afterwards, the new, Basilica, for the immediate reception of the
      emperor and his mother. The splendid canopy and hangings of the
      royal seat were arranged in the customary manner; but it was
      found necessary to defend them. by a strong guard, from the
      insults of the populace. The Arian ecclesiastics, who ventured to
      show themselves in the streets, were exposed to the most imminent
      danger of their lives; and Ambrose enjoyed the merit and
      reputation of rescuing his personal enemies from the hands of the
      enraged multitude.

      63 (return) [ His own representation of his principles and
      conduct (tom. ii. Epist. xx xxi. xxii. p. 852-880) is one of the
      curious monuments of ecclesiastical antiquity. It contains two
      letters to his sister Marcellina, with a petition to Valentinian
      and the sermon de Basilicis non madendis.]

      But while he labored to restrain the effects of their zeal, the
      pathetic vehemence of his sermons continually inflamed the angry
      and seditious temper of the people of Milan. The characters of
      Eve, of the wife of Job, of Jezebel, of Herodias, were indecently
      applied to the mother of the emperor; and her desire to obtain a
      church for the Arians was compared to the most cruel persecutions
      which Christianity had endured under the reign of Paganism. The
      measures of the court served only to expose the magnitude of the
      evil. A fine of two hundred pounds of gold was imposed on the
      corporate body of merchants and manufacturers: an order was
      signified, in the name of the emperor, to all the officers, and
      inferior servants, of the courts of justice, that, during the
      continuance of the public disorders, they should strictly confine
      themselves to their houses; and the ministers of Valentinian
      imprudently confessed, that the most respectable part of the
      citizens of Milan was attached to the cause of their archbishop.
      He was again solicited to restore peace to his country, by timely
      compliance with the will of his sovereign. The reply of Ambrose
      was couched in the most humble and respectful terms, which might,
      however, be interpreted as a serious declaration of civil war.
      “His life and fortune were in the hands of the emperor; but he
      would never betray the church of Christ, or degrade the dignity
      of the episcopal character. In such a cause he was prepared to
      suffer whatever the malice of the daemon could inflict; and he
      only wished to die in the presence of his faithful flock, and at
      the foot of the altar; he had not contributed to excite, but it
      was in the power of God alone to appease, the rage of the people:
      he deprecated the scenes of blood and confusion which were likely
      to ensue; and it was his fervent prayer, that he might not
      survive to behold the ruin of a flourishing city, and perhaps the
      desolation of all Italy.” 64 The obstinate bigotry of Justina
      would have endangered the empire of her son, if, in this contest
      with the church and people of Milan, she could have depended on
      the active obedience of the troops of the palace. A large body of
      Goths had marched to occupy the Basilica, which was the object of
      the dispute: and it might be expected from the Arian principles,
      and barbarous manners, of these foreign mercenaries, that they
      would not entertain any scruples in the execution of the most
      sanguinary orders. They were encountered, on the sacred
      threshold, by the archbishop, who, thundering against them a
      sentence of excommunication, asked them, in the tone of a father
      and a master, whether it was to invade the house of God, that
      they had implored the hospitable protection of the republic. The
      suspense of the Barbarians allowed some hours for a more
      effectual negotiation; and the empress was persuaded, by the
      advice of her wisest counsellors, to leave the Catholics in
      possession of all the churches of Milan; and to dissemble, till a
      more convenient season, her intentions of revenge. The mother of
      Valentinian could never forgive the triumph of Ambrose; and the
      royal youth uttered a passionate exclamation, that his own
      servants were ready to betray him into the hands of an insolent
      priest.

      the causes or the men yet the coadjutor himself had some idea (p.
      84) of imitating St. Ambrose]

      The laws of the empire, some of which were inscribed with the
      name of Valentinian, still condemned the Arian heresy, and seemed
      to excuse the resistance of the Catholics. By the influence of
      Justina, an edict of toleration was promulgated in all the
      provinces which were subject to the court of Milan; the free
      exercise of their religion was granted to those who professed the
      faith of Rimini; and the emperor declared, that all persons who
      should infringe this sacred and salutary constitution, should be
      capitally punished, as the enemies of the public peace. 65 The
      character and language of the archbishop of Milan may justify the
      suspicion, that his conduct soon afforded a reasonable ground, or
      at least a specious pretence, to the Arian ministers; who watched
      the opportunity of surprising him in some act of disobedience to
      a law which he strangely represents as a law of blood and
      tyranny. A sentence of easy and honorable banishment was
      pronounced, which enjoined Ambrose to depart from Milan without
      delay; whilst it permitted him to choose the place of his exile,
      and the number of his companions. But the authority of the
      saints, who have preached and practised the maxims of passive
      loyalty, appeared to Ambrose of less moment than the extreme and
      pressing danger of the church. He boldly refused to obey; and his
      refusal was supported by the unanimous consent of his faithful
      people. 66 They guarded by turns the person of their archbishop;
      the gates of the cathedral and the episcopal palace were strongly
      secured; and the Imperial troops, who had formed the blockade,
      were unwilling to risk the attack, of that impregnable fortress.
      The numerous poor, who had been relieved by the liberality of
      Ambrose, embraced the fair occasion of signalizing their zeal and
      gratitude; and as the patience of the multitude might have been
      exhausted by the length and uniformity of nocturnal vigils, he
      prudently introduced into the church of Milan the useful
      institution of a loud and regular psalmody. While he maintained
      this arduous contest, he was instructed, by a dream, to open the
      earth in a place where the remains of two martyrs, Gervasius and
      Protasius, 67 had been deposited above three hundred years.
      Immediately under the pavement of the church two perfect
      skeletons were found, 68 with the heads separated from their
      bodies, and a plentiful effusion of blood. The holy relics were
      presented, in solemn pomp, to the veneration of the people; and
      every circumstance of this fortunate discovery was admirably
      adapted to promote the designs of Ambrose. The bones of the
      martyrs, their blood, their garments, were supposed to contain a
      healing power; and the praeternatural influence was communicated
      to the most distant objects, without losing any part of its
      original virtue. The extraordinary cure of a blind man, 69 and
      the reluctant confessions of several daemoniacs, appeared to
      justify the faith and sanctity of Ambrose; and the truth of those
      miracles is attested by Ambrose himself, by his secretary
      Paulinus, and by his proselyte, the celebrated Augustin, who, at
      that time, professed the art of rhetoric in Milan. The reason of
      the present age may possibly approve the incredulity of Justina
      and her Arian court; who derided the theatrical representations
      which were exhibited by the contrivance, and at the expense, of
      the archbishop. 70 Their effect, however, on the minds of the
      people, was rapid and irresistible; and the feeble sovereign of
      Italy found himself unable to contend with the favorite of
      Heaven. The powers likewise of the earth interposed in the
      defence of Ambrose: the disinterested advice of Theodosius was
      the genuine result of piety and friendship; and the mask of
      religious zeal concealed the hostile and ambitious designs of the
      tyrant of Gaul. 71

      Sozomen, and Theodoret.]

      The reign of Maximus might have ended in peace and prosperity,
      could he have contented himself with the possession of three
      ample countries, which now constitute the three most flourishing
      kingdoms of modern Europe. But the aspiring usurper, whose sordid
      ambition was not dignified by the love of glory and of arms,
      considered his actual forces as the instruments only of his
      future greatness, and his success was the immediate cause of his
      destruction. The wealth which he extorted 72 from the oppressed
      provinces of Gaul, Spain, and Britain, was employed in levying
      and maintaining a formidable army of Barbarians, collected, for
      the most part, from the fiercest nations of Germany. The conquest
      of Italy was the object of his hopes and preparations: and he
      secretly meditated the ruin of an innocent youth, whose
      government was abhorred and despised by his Catholic subjects.
      But as Maximus wished to occupy, without resistance, the passes
      of the Alps, he received, with perfidious smiles, Domninus of
      Syria, the ambassador of Valentinian, and pressed him to accept
      the aid of a considerable body of troops, for the service of a
      Pannonian war. The penetration of Ambrose had discovered the
      snares of an enemy under the professions of friendship; 73 but
      the Syrian Domninus was corrupted, or deceived, by the liberal
      favor of the court of Treves; and the council of Milan
      obstinately rejected the suspicion of danger, with a blind
      confidence, which was the effect, not of courage, but of fear.
      The march of the auxiliaries was guided by the ambassador; and
      they were admitted, without distrust, into the fortresses of the
      Alps. But the crafty tyrant followed, with hasty and silent
      footsteps, in the rear; and, as he diligently intercepted all
      intelligence of his motions, the gleam of armor, and the dust
      excited by the troops of cavalry, first announced the hostile
      approach of a stranger to the gates of Milan. In this extremity,
      Justina and her son might accuse their own imprudence, and the
      perfidious arts of Maximus; but they wanted time, and force, and
      resolution, to stand against the Gauls and Germans, either in the
      field, or within the walls of a large and disaffected city.
      Flight was their only hope, Aquileia their only refuge; and as
      Maximus now displayed his genuine character, the brother of
      Gratian might expect the same fate from the hands of the same
      assassin. Maximus entered Milan in triumph; and if the wise
      archbishop refused a dangerous and criminal connection with the
      usurper, he might indirectly contribute to the success of his
      arms, by inculcating, from the pulpit, the duty of resignation,
      rather than that of resistance. 74 The unfortunate Justina
      reached Aquileia in safety; but she distrusted the strength of
      the fortifications: she dreaded the event of a siege; and she
      resolved to implore the protection of the great Theodosius, whose
      power and virtue were celebrated in all the countries of the
      West. A vessel was secretly provided to transport the Imperial
      family; they embarked with precipitation in one of the obscure
      harbors of Venetia, or Istria; traversed the whole extent of the
      Adriatic and Ionian Seas; turned the extreme promontory of
      Peloponnesus; and, after a long, but successful navigation,
      reposed themselves in the port of Thessalonica. All the subjects
      of Valentinian deserted the cause of a prince, who, by his
      abdication, had absolved them from the duty of allegiance; and if
      the little city of Aemona, on the verge of Italy, had not
      presumed to stop the career of his inglorious victory, Maximus
      would have obtained, without a struggle, the sole possession of
      the Western empire.

      Instead of inviting his royal guests to take the palace of
      Constantinople, Theodosius had some unknown reasons to fix their
      residence at Thessalonica; but these reasons did not proceed from
      contempt or indifference, as he speedily made a visit to that
      city, accompanied by the greatest part of his court and senate.
      After the first tender expressions of friendship and sympathy,
      the pious emperor of the East gently admonished Justina, that the
      guilt of heresy was sometimes punished in this world, as well as
      in the next; and that the public profession of the Nicene faith
      would be the most efficacious step to promote the restoration of
      her son, by the satisfaction which it must occasion both on earth
      and in heaven. The momentous question of peace or war was
      referred, by Theodosius, to the deliberation of his council; and
      the arguments which might be alleged on the side of honor and
      justice, had acquired, since the death of Gratian, a considerable
      degree of additional weight. The persecution of the Imperial
      family, to which Theodosius himself had been indebted for his
      fortune, was now aggravated by recent and repeated injuries.
      Neither oaths nor treaties could restrain the boundless ambition
      of Maximus; and the delay of vigorous and decisive measures,
      instead of prolonging the blessings of peace, would expose the
      Eastern empire to the danger of a hostile invasion. The
      Barbarians, who had passed the Danube, had lately assumed the
      character of soldiers and subjects, but their native fierceness
      was yet untamed: and the operations of a war, which would
      exercise their valor, and diminish their numbers, might tend to
      relieve the provinces from an intolerable oppression.
      Notwithstanding these specious and solid reasons, which were
      approved by a majority of the council, Theodosius still hesitated
      whether he should draw the sword in a contest which could no
      longer admit any terms of reconciliation; and his magnanimous
      character was not disgraced by the apprehensions which he felt
      for the safety of his infant sons, and the welfare of his
      exhausted people. In this moment of anxious doubt, while the fate
      of the Roman world depended on the resolution of a single man,
      the charms of the princess Galla most powerfully pleaded the
      cause of her brother Valentinian. 75 The heart of Theodosius wa
      softened by the tears of beauty; his affections were insensibly
      engaged by the graces of youth and innocence: the art of Justina
      managed and directed the impulse of passion; and the celebration
      of the royal nuptials was the assurance and signal of the civil
      war. The unfeeling critics, who consider every amorous weakness
      as an indelible stain on the memory of a great and orthodox
      emperor, are inclined, on this occasion, to dispute the
      suspicious evidence of the historian Zosimus. For my own part, I
      shall frankly confess, that I am willing to find, or even to
      seek, in the revolutions of the world, some traces of the mild
      and tender sentiments of domestic life; and amidst the crowd of
      fierce and ambitious conquerors, I can distinguish, with peculiar
      complacency, a gentle hero, who may be supposed to receive his
      armor from the hands of love. The alliance of the Persian king
      was secured by the faith of treaties; the martial Barbarians were
      persuaded to follow the standard, or to respect the frontiers, of
      an active and liberal monarch; and the dominions of Theodosius,
      from the Euphrates to the Adriatic, resounded with the
      preparations of war both by land and sea. The skilful disposition
      of the forces of the East seemed to multiply their numbers, and
      distracted the attention of Maximus. He had reason to fear, that
      a chosen body of troops, under the command of the intrepid
      Arbogastes, would direct their march along the banks of the
      Danube, and boldly penetrate through the Rhaetian provinces into
      the centre of Gaul. A powerful fleet was equipped in the harbors
      of Greece and Epirus, with an apparent design, that, as soon as
      the passage had been opened by a naval victory, Valentinian and
      his mother should land in Italy, proceed, without delay, to Rome,
      and occupy the majestic seat of religion and empire. In the mean
      while, Theodosius himself advanced at the head of a brave and
      disciplined army, to encounter his unworthy rival, who, after the
      siege of Aemona, 7511 had fixed his camp in the neighborhood of
      Siscia, a city of Pannonia, strongly fortified by the broad and
      rapid stream of the Save.

      Chapter XXVII: Civil Wars, Reign Of Theodosius.—Part IV.

      The veterans, who still remembered the long resistance, and
      successive resources, of the tyrant Magnentius, might prepare
      themselves for the labors of three bloody campaigns. But the
      contest with his successor, who, like him, had usurped the throne
      of the West, was easily decided in the term of two months, 76 and
      within the space of two hundred miles. The superior genius of the
      emperor of the East might prevail over the feeble Maximus, who,
      in this important crisis, showed himself destitute of military
      skill, or personal courage; but the abilities of Theodosius were
      seconded by the advantage which he possessed of a numerous and
      active cavalry. The Huns, the Alani, and, after their example,
      the Goths themselves, were formed into squadrons of archers; who
      fought on horseback, and confounded the steady valor of the Gauls
      and Germans, by the rapid motions of a Tartar war. After the
      fatigue of a long march, in the heat of summer, they spurred
      their foaming horses into the waters of the Save, swam the river
      in the presence of the enemy, and instantly charged and routed
      the troops who guarded the high ground on the opposite side.
      Marcellinus, the tyrant’s brother, advanced to support them with
      the select cohorts, which were considered as the hope and
      strength of the army. The action, which had been interrupted by
      the approach of night, was renewed in the morning; and, after a
      sharp conflict, the surviving remnant of the bravest soldiers of
      Maximus threw down their arms at the feet of the conqueror.
      Without suspending his march, to receive the loyal acclamations
      of the citizens of Aemona, Theodosius pressed forwards to
      terminate the war by the death or captivity of his rival, who
      fled before him with the diligence of fear. From the summit of
      the Julian Alps, he descended with such incredible speed into the
      plain of Italy, that he reached Aquileia on the evening of the
      first day; and Maximus, who found himself encompassed on all
      sides, had scarcely time to shut the gates of the city. But the
      gates could not long resist the effort of a victorious enemy; and
      the despair, the disaffection, the indifference of the soldiers
      and people, hastened the downfall of the wretched Maximus. He was
      dragged from his throne, rudely stripped of the Imperial
      ornaments, the robe, the diadem, and the purple slippers; and
      conducted, like a malefactor, to the camp and presence of
      Theodosius, at a place about three miles from Aquileia. The
      behavior of the emperor was not intended to insult, and he showed
      disposition to pity and forgive, the tyrant of the West, who had
      never been his personal enemy, and was now become the object of
      his contempt. Our sympathy is the most forcibly excited by the
      misfortunes to which we are exposed; and the spectacle of a proud
      competitor, now prostrate at his feet, could not fail of
      producing very serious and solemn thoughts in the mind of the
      victorious emperor. But the feeble emotion of involuntary pity
      was checked by his regard for public justice, and the memory of
      Gratian; and he abandoned the victim to the pious zeal of the
      soldiers, who drew him out of the Imperial presence, and
      instantly separated his head from his body. The intelligence of
      his defeat and death was received with sincere or well-dissembled
      joy: his son Victor, on whom he had conferred the title of
      Augustus, died by the order, perhaps by the hand, of the bold
      Arbogastes; and all the military plans of Theodosius were
      successfully executed. When he had thus terminated the civil war,
      with less difficulty and bloodshed than he might naturally
      expect, he employed the winter months of his residence at Milan,
      to restore the state of the afflicted provinces; and early in the
      spring he made, after the example of Constantine and Constantius,
      his triumphal entry into the ancient capital of the Roman empire.

      good fortune of Aquileia.]

      The orator, who may be silent without danger, may praise without
      difficulty, and without reluctance; 78 and posterity will
      confess, that the character of Theodosius 79 might furnish the
      subject of a sincere and ample panegyric. The wisdom of his laws,
      and the success of his arms, rendered his administration
      respectable in the eyes both of his subjects and of his enemies.
      He loved and practised the virtues of domestic life, which seldom
      hold their residence in the palaces of kings. Theodosius was
      chaste and temperate; he enjoyed, without excess, the sensual and
      social pleasures of the table; and the warmth of his amorous
      passions was never diverted from their lawful objects. The proud
      titles of Imperial greatness were adorned by the tender names of
      a faithful husband, an indulgent father; his uncle was raised, by
      his affectionate esteem, to the rank of a second parent:
      Theodosius embraced, as his own, the children of his brother and
      sister; and the expressions of his regard were extended to the
      most distant and obscure branches of his numerous kindred. His
      familiar friends were judiciously selected from among those
      persons, who, in the equal intercourse of private life, had
      appeared before his eyes without a mask; the consciousness of
      personal and superior merit enabled him to despise the accidental
      distinction of the purple; and he proved by his conduct, that he
      had forgotten all the injuries, while he most gratefully
      remembered all the favors and services, which he had received
      before he ascended the throne of the Roman empire. The serious or
      lively tone of his conversation was adapted to the age, the rank,
      or the character of his subjects, whom he admitted into his
      society; and the affability of his manners displayed the image of
      his mind. Theodosius respected the simplicity of the good and
      virtuous: every art, every talent, of a useful, or even of an
      innocent nature, was rewarded by his judicious liberality; and,
      except the heretics, whom he persecuted with implacable hatred,
      the diffusive circle of his benevolence was circumscribed only by
      the limits of the human race. The government of a mighty empire
      may assuredly suffice to occupy the time, and the abilities, of a
      mortal: yet the diligent prince, without aspiring to the
      unsuitable reputation of profound learning, always reserved some
      moments of his leisure for the instructive amusement of reading.
      History, which enlarged his experience, was his favorite study.
      The annals of Rome, in the long period of eleven hundred years,
      presented him with a various and splendid picture of human life:
      and it has been particularly observed, that whenever he perused
      the cruel acts of Cinna, of Marius, or of Sylla, he warmly
      expressed his generous detestation of those enemies of humanity
      and freedom. His disinterested opinion of past events was
      usefully applied as the rule of his own actions; and Theodosius
      has deserved the singular commendation, that his virtues always
      seemed to expand with his fortune: the season of his prosperity
      was that of his moderation; and his clemency appeared the most
      conspicuous after the danger and success of a civil war. The
      Moorish guards of the tyrant had been massacred in the first heat
      of the victory, and a small number of the most obnoxious
      criminals suffered the punishment of the law. But the emperor
      showed himself much more attentive to relieve the innocent than
      to chastise the guilty. The oppressed subjects of the West, who
      would have deemed themselves happy in the restoration of their
      lands, were astonished to receive a sum of money equivalent to
      their losses; and the liberality of the conqueror supported the
      aged mother, and educated the orphan daughters, of Maximus. 80 A
      character thus accomplished might almost excuse the extravagant
      supposition of the orator Pacatus; that, if the elder Brutus
      could be permitted to revisit the earth, the stern republican
      would abjure, at the feet of Theodosius, his hatred of kings; and
      ingenuously confess, that such a monarch was the most faithful
      guardian of the happiness and dignity of the Roman people. 81

      Yet the piercing eye of the founder of the republic must have
      discerned two essential imperfections, which might, perhaps, have
      abated his recent love of despostism. The virtuous mind of
      Theodosius was often relaxed by indolence, 82 and it was
      sometimes inflamed by passion. 83 In the pursuit of an important
      object, his active courage was capable of the most vigorous
      exertions; but, as soon as the design was accomplished, or the
      danger was surmounted, the hero sunk into inglorious repose; and,
      forgetful that the time of a prince is the property of his
      people, resigned himself to the enjoyment of the innocent, but
      trifling, pleasures of a luxurious court. The natural disposition
      of Theodosius was hasty and choleric; and, in a station where
      none could resist, and few would dissuade, the fatal consequence
      of his resentment, the humane monarch was justly alarmed by the
      consciousness of his infirmity and of his power. It was the
      constant study of his life to suppress, or regulate, the
      intemperate sallies of passion and the success of his efforts
      enhanced the merit of his clemency. But the painful virtue which
      claims the merit of victory, is exposed to the danger of defeat;
      and the reign of a wise and merciful prince was polluted by an
      act of cruelty which would stain the annals of Nero or Domitian.
      Within the space of three years, the inconsistent historian of
      Theodosius must relate the generous pardon of the citizens of
      Antioch, and the inhuman massacre of the people of Thessalonica.

      Theodosius (Claud. in iv. Hon. 266, &c.) exhorts his son to
      moderate his anger.]

      The lively impatience of the inhabitants of Antioch was never
      satisfied with their own situation, or with the character and
      conduct of their successive sovereigns. The Arian subjects of
      Theodosius deplored the loss of their churches; and as three
      rival bishops disputed the throne of Antioch, the sentence which
      decided their pretensions excited the murmurs of the two
      unsuccessful congregations. The exigencies of the Gothic war, and
      the inevitable expense that accompanied the conclusion of the
      peace, had constrained the emperor to aggravate the weight of the
      public impositions; and the provinces of Asia, as they had not
      been involved in the distress were the less inclined to
      contribute to the relief, of Europe. The auspicious period now
      approached of the tenth year of his reign; a festival more
      grateful to the soldiers, who received a liberal donative, than
      to the subjects, whose voluntary offerings had been long since
      converted into an extraordinary and oppressive burden. The edicts
      of taxation interrupted the repose, and pleasures, of Antioch;
      and the tribunal of the magistrate was besieged by a suppliant
      crowd; who, in pathetic, but, at first, in respectful language,
      solicited the redress of their grievances. They were gradually
      incensed by the pride of their haughty rulers, who treated their
      complaints as a criminal resistance; their satirical wit
      degenerated into sharp and angry invectives; and, from the
      subordinate powers of government, the invectives of the people
      insensibly rose to attack the sacred character of the emperor
      himself. Their fury, provoked by a feeble opposition, discharged
      itself on the images of the Imperial family, which were erected,
      as objects of public veneration, in the most conspicuous places
      of the city. The statues of Theodosius, of his father, of his
      wife Flaccilla, of his two sons, Arcadius and Honorius, were
      insolently thrown down from their pedestals, broken in pieces, or
      dragged with contempt through the streets; and the indignities
      which were offered to the representations of Imperial majesty,
      sufficiently declared the impious and treasonable wishes of the
      populace. The tumult was almost immediately suppressed by the
      arrival of a body of archers: and Antioch had leisure to reflect
      on the nature and consequences of her crime. 84 According to the
      duty of his office, the governor of the province despatched a
      faithful narrative of the whole transaction: while the trembling
      citizens intrusted the confession of their crime, and the
      assurances of their repentance, to the zeal of Flavian, their
      bishop, and to the eloquence of the senator Hilarius, the friend,
      and most probably the disciple, of Libanius; whose genius, on
      this melancholy occasion, was not useless to his country. 85 But
      the two capitals, Antioch and Constantinople, were separated by
      the distance of eight hundred miles; and, notwithstanding the
      diligence of the Imperial posts, the guilty city was severely
      punished by a long and dreadful interval of suspense. Every rumor
      agitated the hopes and fears of the Antiochians, and they heard
      with terror, that their sovereign, exasperated by the insult
      which had been offered to his own statues, and more especially,
      to those of his beloved wife, had resolved to level with the
      ground the offending city; and to massacre, without distinction
      of age or sex, the criminal inhabitants; 86 many of whom were
      actually driven, by their apprehensions, to seek a refuge in the
      mountains of Syria, and the adjacent desert. At length,
      twenty-four days after the sedition, the general Hellebicus and
      Caesarius, master of the offices, declared the will of the
      emperor, and the sentence of Antioch. That proud capital was
      degraded from the rank of a city; and the metropolis of the East,
      stripped of its lands, its privileges, and its revenues, was
      subjected, under the humiliating denomination of a village, to
      the jurisdiction of Laodicea. 87 The baths, the Circus, and the
      theatres were shut: and, that every source of plenty and pleasure
      might at the same time be intercepted, the distribution of corn
      was abolished, by the severe instructions of Theodosius. His
      commissioners then proceeded to inquire into the guilt of
      individuals; of those who had perpetrated, and of those who had
      not prevented, the destruction of the sacred statues. The
      tribunal of Hellebicus and Caesarius, encompassed with armed
      soldiers, was erected in the midst of the Forum. The noblest, and
      most wealthy, of the citizens of Antioch appeared before them in
      chains; the examination was assisted by the use of torture, and
      their sentence was pronounced or suspended, according to the
      judgment of these extraordinary magistrates. The houses of the
      criminals were exposed to sale, their wives and children were
      suddenly reduced, from affluence and luxury, to the most abject
      distress; and a bloody execution was expected to conclude the
      horrors of the day, 88 which the preacher of Antioch, the
      eloquent Chrysostom, has represented as a lively image of the
      last and universal judgment of the world. But the ministers of
      Theodosius performed, with reluctance, the cruel task which had
      been assigned them; they dropped a gentle tear over the
      calamities of the people; and they listened with reverence to the
      pressing solicitations of the monks and hermits, who descended in
      swarms from the mountains. 89 Hellebicus and Caesarius were
      persuaded to suspend the execution of their sentence; and it was
      agreed that the former should remain at Antioch, while the latter
      returned, with all possible speed, to Constantinople; and
      presumed once more to consult the will of his sovereign. The
      resentment of Theodosius had already subsided; the deputies of
      the people, both the bishop and the orator, had obtained a
      favorable audience; and the reproaches of the emperor were the
      complaints of injured friendship, rather than the stern menaces
      of pride and power. A free and general pardon was granted to the
      city and citizens of Antioch; the prison doors were thrown open;
      the senators, who despaired of their lives, recovered the
      possession of their houses and estates; and the capital of the
      East was restored to the enjoyment of her ancient dignity and
      splendor. Theodosius condescended to praise the senate of
      Constantinople, who had generously interceded for their
      distressed brethren: he rewarded the eloquence of Hilarius with
      the government of Palestine; and dismissed the bishop of Antioch
      with the warmest expressions of his respect and gratitude. A
      thousand new statues arose to the clemency of Theodosius; the
      applause of his subjects was ratified by the approbation of his
      own heart; and the emperor confessed, that, if the exercise of
      justice is the most important duty, the indulgence of mercy is
      the most exquisite pleasure, of a sovereign. 90

      p. 137-224) had read him with pious curiosity and diligence.]

      The sedition of Thessalonica is ascribed to a more shameful
      cause, and was productive of much more dreadful consequences.
      That great city, the metropolis of all the Illyrian provinces,
      had been protected from the dangers of the Gothic war by strong
      fortifications and a numerous garrison. Botheric, the general of
      those troops, and, as it should seem from his name, a Barbarian,
      had among his slaves a beautiful boy, who excited the impure
      desires of one of the charioteers of the Circus. The insolent and
      brutal lover was thrown into prison by the order of Botheric; and
      he sternly rejected the importunate clamors of the multitude,
      who, on the day of the public games, lamented the absence of
      their favorite; and considered the skill of a charioteer as an
      object of more importance than his virtue. The resentment of the
      people was imbittered by some previous disputes; and, as the
      strength of the garrison had been drawn away for the service of
      the Italian war, the feeble remnant, whose numbers were reduced
      by desertion, could not save the unhappy general from their
      licentious fury. Botheric, and several of his principal officers,
      were inhumanly murdered; their mangled bodies were dragged about
      the streets; and the emperor, who then resided at Milan, was
      surprised by the intelligence of the audacious and wanton cruelty
      of the people of Thessalonica. The sentence of a dispassionate
      judge would have inflicted a severe punishment on the authors of
      the crime; and the merit of Botheric might contribute to
      exasperate the grief and indignation of his master.

      The fiery and choleric temper of Theodosius was impatient of the
      dilatory forms of a judicial inquiry; and he hastily resolved,
      that the blood of his lieutenant should be expiated by the blood
      of the guilty people. Yet his mind still fluctuated between the
      counsels of clemency and of revenge; the zeal of the bishops had
      almost extorted from the reluctant emperor the promise of a
      general pardon; his passion was again inflamed by the flattering
      suggestions of his minister Rufinus; and, after Theodosius had
      despatched the messengers of death, he attempted, when it was too
      late, to prevent the execution of his orders. The punishment of a
      Roman city was blindly committed to the undistinguishing sword of
      the Barbarians; and the hostile preparations were concerted with
      the dark and perfidious artifice of an illegal conspiracy. The
      people of Thessalonica were treacherously invited, in the name of
      their sovereign, to the games of the Circus; and such was their
      insatiate avidity for those amusements, that every consideration
      of fear, or suspicion, was disregarded by the numerous
      spectators. As soon as the assembly was complete, the soldiers,
      who had secretly been posted round the Circus, received the
      signal, not of the races, but of a general massacre. The
      promiscuous carnage continued three hours, without discrimination
      of strangers or natives, of age or sex, of innocence or guilt;
      the most moderate accounts state the number of the slain at seven
      thousand; and it is affirmed by some writers that more than
      fifteen thousand victims were sacrificed to the names of
      Botheric. A foreign merchant, who had probably no concern in his
      murder, offered his own life, and all his wealth, to supply the
      place of one of his two sons; but, while the father hesitated
      with equal tenderness, while he was doubtful to choose, and
      unwilling to condemn, the soldiers determined his suspense, by
      plunging their daggers at the same moment into the breasts of the
      defenceless youths. The apology of the assassins, that they were
      obliged to produce the prescribed number of heads, serves only to
      increase, by an appearance of order and design, the horrors of
      the massacre, which was executed by the commands of Theodosius.
      The guilt of the emperor is aggravated by his long and frequent
      residence at Thessalonica. The situation of the unfortunate city,
      the aspect of the streets and buildings, the dress and faces of
      the inhabitants, were familiar, and even present, to his
      imagination; and Theodosius possessed a quick and lively sense of
      the existence of the people whom he destroyed. 91

      li. p. 998.) Augustin, (de Civitat. Dei, v. 26,) and Paulinus,

      horror and pity. It is illustrated by the subsequent and unequal
      testimonies of Sozomen, (l. vii. c. 25,) Theodoret, (l. v. c.
      17,) Theophanes, (Chronograph. p. 62,) Cedrenus, (p. 317,) and
      Zonaras, (tom. ii. l. xiii. p. 34.) Zosimus alone, the partial
      enemy of Theodosius, most unaccountably passes over in silence
      the worst of his actions.]

      The respectful attachment of the emperor for the orthodox clergy,
      had disposed him to love and admire the character of Ambrose; who
      united all the episcopal virtues in the most eminent degree. The
      friends and ministers of Theodosius imitated the example of their
      sovereign; and he observed, with more surprise than displeasure,
      that all his secret counsels were immediately communicated to the
      archbishop; who acted from the laudable persuasion, that every
      measure of civil government may have some connection with the
      glory of God, and the interest of the true religion. The monks
      and populace of Callinicum, 9111 an obscure town on the frontier
      of Persia, excited by their own fanaticism, and by that of their
      bishop, had tumultuously burnt a conventicle of the Valentinians,
      and a synagogue of the Jews. The seditious prelate was condemned,
      by the magistrate of the province, either to rebuild the
      synagogue, or to repay the damage; and this moderate sentence was
      confirmed by the emperor. But it was not confirmed by the
      archbishop of Milan. 92 He dictated an epistle of censure and
      reproach, more suitable, perhaps, if the emperor had received the
      mark of circumcision, and renounced the faith of his baptism.
      Ambrose considers the toleration of the Jewish, as the
      persecution of the Christian, religion; boldly declares that he
      himself, and every true believer, would eagerly dispute with the
      bishop of Callinicum the merit of the deed, and the crown of
      martyrdom; and laments, in the most pathetic terms, that the
      execution of the sentence would be fatal to the fame and
      salvation of Theodosius. As this private admonition did not
      produce an immediate effect, the archbishop, from his pulpit, 93
      publicly addressed the emperor on his throne; 94 nor would he
      consent to offer the oblation of the altar, till he had obtained
      from Theodosius a solemn and positive declaration, which secured
      the impunity of the bishop and monks of Callinicum. The
      recantation of Theodosius was sincere; 95 and, during the term of
      his residence at Milan, his affection for Ambrose was continually
      increased by the habits of pious and familiar conversation.

      When Ambrose was informed of the massacre of Thessalonica, his
      mind was filled with horror and anguish. He retired into the
      country to indulge his grief, and to avoid the presence of
      Theodosius. But as the archbishop was satisfied that a timid
      silence would render him the accomplice of his guilt, he
      represented, in a private letter, the enormity of the crime;
      which could only be effaced by the tears of penitence. The
      episcopal vigor of Ambrose was tempered by prudence; and he
      contented himself with signifying 96 an indirect sort of
      excommunication, by the assurance, that he had been warned in a
      vision not to offer the oblation in the name, or in the presence,
      of Theodosius; and by the advice, that he would confine himself
      to the use of prayer, without presuming to approach the altar of
      Christ, or to receive the holy eucharist with those hands that
      were still polluted with the blood of an innocent people. The
      emperor was deeply affected by his own reproaches, and by those
      of his spiritual father; and after he had bewailed the
      mischievous and irreparable consequences of his rash fury, he
      proceeded, in the accustomed manner, to perform his devotions in
      the great church of Milan. He was stopped in the porch by the
      archbishop; who, in the tone and language of an ambassador of
      Heaven, declared to his sovereign, that private contrition was
      not sufficient to atone for a public fault, or to appease the
      justice of the offended Deity. Theodosius humbly represented,
      that if he had contracted the guilt of homicide, David, the man
      after God’s own heart, had been guilty, not only of murder, but
      of adultery. “You have imitated David in his crime, imitate then
      his repentance,” was the reply of the undaunted Ambrose. The
      rigorous conditions of peace and pardon were accepted; and the
      public penance of the emperor Theodosius has been recorded as one
      of the most honorable events in the annals of the church.
      According to the mildest rules of ecclesiastical discipline,
      which were established in the fourth century, the crime of
      homicide was expiated by the penitence of twenty years: 97 and as
      it was impossible, in the period of human life, to purge the
      accumulated guilt of the massacre of Thessalonica, the murderer
      should have been excluded from the holy communion till the hour
      of his death. But the archbishop, consulting the maxims of
      religious policy, granted some indulgence to the rank of his
      illustrious penitent, who humbled in the dust the pride of the
      diadem; and the public edification might be admitted as a weighty
      reason to abridge the duration of his punishment. It was
      sufficient, that the emperor of the Romans, stripped of the
      ensigns of royalty, should appear in a mournful and suppliant
      posture; and that, in the midst of the church of Milan, he should
      humbly solicit, with sighs and tears, the pardon of his sins. 98
      In this spiritual cure, Ambrose employed the various methods of
      mildness and severity. After a delay of about eight months,
      Theodosius was restored to the communion of the faithful; and the
      edict which interposes a salutary interval of thirty days between
      the sentence and the execution, may be accepted as the worthy
      fruits of his repentance. 99 Posterity has applauded the virtuous
      firmness of the archbishop; and the example of Theodosius may
      prove the beneficial influence of those principles, which could
      force a monarch, exalted above the apprehension of human
      punishment, to respect the laws, and ministers, of an invisible
      Judge. “The prince,” says Montesquieu, “who is actuated by the
      hopes and fears of religion, may be compared to a lion, docile
      only to the voice, and tractable to the hand, of his keeper.” 100
      The motions of the royal animal will therefore depend on the
      inclination, and interest, of the man who has acquired such
      dangerous authority over him; and the priest, who holds in his
      hands the conscience of a king, may inflame, or moderate, his
      sanguinary passions. The cause of humanity, and that of
      persecution, have been asserted, by the same Ambrose, with equal
      energy, and with equal success.

      Chapter XXVII: Civil Wars, Reign Of Theodosius.—Part V.

      After the defeat and death of the tyrant of Gaul, the Roman world
      was in the possession of Theodosius. He derived from the choice
      of Gratian his honorable title to the provinces of the East: he
      had acquired the West by the right of conquest; and the three
      years which he spent in Italy were usefully employed to restore
      the authority of the laws, and to correct the abuses which had
      prevailed with impunity under the usurpation of Maximus, and the
      minority of Valentinian. The name of Valentinian was regularly
      inserted in the public acts: but the tender age, and doubtful
      faith, of the son of Justina, appeared to require the prudent
      care of an orthodox guardian; and his specious ambition might
      have excluded the unfortunate youth, without a struggle, and
      almost without a murmur, from the administration, and even from
      the inheritance, of the empire. If Theodosius had consulted the
      rigid maxims of interest and policy, his conduct would have been
      justified by his friends; but the generosity of his behavior on
      this memorable occasion has extorted the applause of his most
      inveterate enemies. He seated Valentinian on the throne of Milan;
      and, without stipulating any present or future advantages,
      restored him to the absolute dominion of all the provinces, from
      which he had been driven by the arms of Maximus. To the
      restitution of his ample patrimony, Theodosius added the free and
      generous gift of the countries beyond the Alps, which his
      successful valor had recovered from the assassin of Gratian. 101
      Satisfied with the glory which he had acquired, by revenging the
      death of his benefactor, and delivering the West from the yoke of
      tyranny, the emperor returned from Milan to Constantinople; and,
      in the peaceful possession of the East, insensibly relapsed into
      his former habits of luxury and indolence. Theodosius discharged
      his obligation to the brother, he indulged his conjugal
      tenderness to the sister, of Valentinian; and posterity, which
      admires the pure and singular glory of his elevation, must
      applaud his unrivalled generosity in the use of victory.

      101 (return) [ It is the niggard praise of Zosimus himself, (l.
      iv. p. 267.) Augustin says, with some happiness of expression,
      Valentinianum.... misericordissima veneratione restituit.]

      The empress Justina did not long survive her return to Italy;
      and, though she beheld the triumph of Theodosius, she was not
      allowed to influence the government of her son. 102 The
      pernicious attachment to the Arian sect, which Valentinian had
      imbibed from her example and instructions, was soon erased by the
      lessons of a more orthodox education. His growing zeal for the
      faith of Nice, and his filial reverence for the character and
      authority of Ambrose, disposed the Catholics to entertain the
      most favorable opinion of the virtues of the young emperor of the
      West. 103 They applauded his chastity and temperance, his
      contempt of pleasure, his application to business, and his tender
      affection for his two sisters; which could not, however, seduce
      his impartial equity to pronounce an unjust sentence against the
      meanest of his subjects. But this amiable youth, before he had
      accomplished the twentieth year of his age, was oppressed by
      domestic treason; and the empire was again involved in the
      horrors of a civil war. Arbogastes, 104 a gallant soldier of the
      nation of the Franks, held the second rank in the service of
      Gratian. On the death of his master he joined the standard of
      Theodosius; contributed, by his valor and military conduct, to
      the destruction of the tyrant; and was appointed, after the
      victory, master-general of the armies of Gaul. His real merit,
      and apparent fidelity, had gained the confidence both of the
      prince and people; his boundless liberality corrupted the
      allegiance of the troops; and, whilst he was universally esteemed
      as the pillar of the state, the bold and crafty Barbarian was
      secretly determined either to rule, or to ruin, the empire of the
      West. The important commands of the army were distributed among
      the Franks; the creatures of Arbogastes were promoted to all the
      honors and offices of the civil government; the progress of the
      conspiracy removed every faithful servant from the presence of
      Valentinian; and the emperor, without power and without
      intelligence, insensibly sunk into the precarious and dependent
      condition of a captive. 105 The indignation which he expressed,
      though it might arise only from the rash and impatient temper of
      youth, may be candidly ascribed to the generous spirit of a
      prince, who felt that he was not unworthy to reign. He secretly
      invited the archbishop of Milan to undertake the office of a
      mediator; as the pledge of his sincerity, and the guardian of his
      safety. He contrived to apprise the emperor of the East of his
      helpless situation, and he declared, that, unless Theodosius
      could speedily march to his assistance, he must attempt to escape
      from the palace, or rather prison, of Vienna in Gaul, where he
      had imprudently fixed his residence in the midst of the hostile
      faction. But the hopes of relief were distant, and doubtful: and,
      as every day furnished some new provocation, the emperor, without
      strength or counsel, too hastily resolved to risk an immediate
      contest with his powerful general. He received Arbogastes on the
      throne; and, as the count approached with some appearance of
      respect, delivered to him a paper, which dismissed him from all
      his employments. “My authority,” replied Arbogastes, with
      insulting coolness, “does not depend on the smile or the frown of
      a monarch;” and he contemptuously threw the paper on the ground.
      The indignant monarch snatched at the sword of one of the guards,
      which he struggled to draw from its scabbard; and it was not
      without some degree of violence that he was prevented from using
      the deadly weapon against his enemy, or against himself. A few
      days after this extraordinary quarrel, in which he had exposed
      his resentment and his weakness, the unfortunate Valentinian was
      found strangled in his apartment; and some pains were employed to
      disguise the manifest guilt of Arbogastes, and to persuade the
      world, that the death of the young emperor had been the voluntary
      effect of his own despair. 106 His body was conducted with decent
      pomp to the sepulchre of Milan; and the archbishop pronounced a
      funeral oration to commemorate his virtues and his misfortunes.
      107 On this occasion the humanity of Ambrose tempted him to make
      a singular breach in his theological system; and to comfort the
      weeping sisters of Valentinian, by the firm assurance, that their
      pious brother, though he had not received the sacrament of
      baptism, was introduced, without difficulty, into the mansions of
      eternal bliss. 108

      The prudence of Arbogastes had prepared the success of his
      ambitious designs: and the provincials, in whose breast every
      sentiment of patriotism or loyalty was extinguished, expected,
      with tame resignation, the unknown master, whom the choice of a
      Frank might place on the Imperial throne. But some remains of
      pride and prejudice still opposed the elevation of Arbogastes
      himself; and the judicious Barbarian thought it more advisable to
      reign under the name of some dependent Roman. He bestowed the
      purple on the rhetorician Eugenius; 109 whom he had already
      raised from the place of his domestic secretary to the rank of
      master of the offices. In the course, both of his private and
      public service, the count had always approved the attachment and
      abilities of Eugenius; his learning and eloquence, supported by
      the gravity of his manners, recommended him to the esteem of the
      people; and the reluctance with which he seemed to ascend the
      throne, may inspire a favorable prejudice of his virtue and
      moderation. The ambassadors of the new emperor were immediately
      despatched to the court of Theodosius, to communicate, with
      affected grief, the unfortunate accident of the death of
      Valentinian; and, without mentioning the name of Arbogastes, to
      request, that the monarch of the East would embrace, as his
      lawful colleague, the respectable citizen, who had obtained the
      unanimous suffrage of the armies and provinces of the West. 110
      Theodosius was justly provoked, that the perfidy of a Barbarian,
      should have destroyed, in a moment, the labors, and the fruit, of
      his former victory; and he was excited by the tears of his
      beloved wife, 111 to revenge the fate of her unhappy brother, and
      once more to assert by arms the violated majesty of the throne.
      But as the second conquest of the West was a task of difficulty
      and danger, he dismissed, with splendid presents, and an
      ambiguous answer, the ambassadors of Eugenius; and almost two
      years were consumed in the preparations of the civil war. Before
      he formed any decisive resolution, the pious emperor was anxious
      to discover the will of Heaven; and as the progress of
      Christianity had silenced the oracles of Delphi and Dodona, he
      consulted an Egyptian monk, who possessed, in the opinion of the
      age, the gift of miracles, and the knowledge of futurity.
      Eutropius, one of the favorite eunuchs of the palace of
      Constantinople, embarked for Alexandria, from whence he sailed up
      the Nile, as far as the city of Lycopolis, or of Wolves, in the
      remote province of Thebais. 112 In the neighborhood of that city,
      and on the summit of a lofty mountain, the holy John 113 had
      constructed, with his own hands, an humble cell, in which he had
      dwelt above fifty years, without opening his door, without seeing
      the face of a woman, and without tasting any food that had been
      prepared by fire, or any human art. Five days of the week he
      spent in prayer and meditation; but on Saturdays and Sundays he
      regularly opened a small window, and gave audience to the crowd
      of suppliants who successively flowed from every part of the
      Christian world. The eunuch of Theodosius approached the window
      with respectful steps, proposed his questions concerning the
      event of the civil war, and soon returned with a favorable
      oracle, which animated the courage of the emperor by the
      assurance of a bloody, but infallible victory. 114 The
      accomplishment of the prediction was forwarded by all the means
      that human prudence could supply. The industry of the two
      master-generals, Stilicho and Timasius, was directed to recruit
      the numbers, and to revive the discipline of the Roman legions.
      The formidable troops of Barbarians marched under the ensigns of
      their national chieftains. The Iberian, the Arab, and the Goth,
      who gazed on each other with mutual astonishment, were enlisted
      in the service of the same prince; 1141 and the renowned Alaric
      acquired, in the school of Theodosius, the knowledge of the art
      of war, which he afterwards so fatally exerted for the
      destruction of Rome. 115

      The emperor of the West, or, to speak more properly, his general
      Arbogastes, was instructed by the misconduct and misfortune of
      Maximus, how dangerous it might prove to extend the line of
      defence against a skilful antagonist, who was free to press, or
      to suspend, to contract, or to multiply, his various methods of
      attack. 116 Arbogastes fixed his station on the confines of
      Italy; the troops of Theodosius were permitted to occupy, without
      resistance, the provinces of Pannonia, as far as the foot of the
      Julian Alps; and even the passes of the mountains were
      negligently, or perhaps artfully, abandoned to the bold invader.
      He descended from the hills, and beheld, with some astonishment,
      the formidable camp of the Gauls and Germans, that covered with
      arms and tents the open country which extends to the walls of
      Aquileia, and the banks of the Frigidus, 117 or Cold River. 118
      This narrow theatre of the war, circumscribed by the Alps and the
      Adriatic, did not allow much room for the operations of military
      skill; the spirit of Arbogastes would have disdained a pardon;
      his guilt extinguished the hope of a negotiation; and Theodosius
      was impatient to satisfy his glory and revenge, by the
      chastisement of the assassins of Valentinian. Without weighing
      the natural and artificial obstacles that opposed his efforts,
      the emperor of the East immediately attacked the fortifications
      of his rivals, assigned the post of honorable danger to the
      Goths, and cherished a secret wish, that the bloody conflict
      might diminish the pride and numbers of the conquerors. Ten
      thousand of those auxiliaries, and Bacurius, general of the
      Iberians, died bravely on the field of battle. But the victory
      was not purchased by their blood; the Gauls maintained their
      advantage; and the approach of night protected the disorderly
      flight, or retreat, of the troops of Theodosius. The emperor
      retired to the adjacent hills; where he passed a disconsolate
      night, without sleep, without provisions, and without hopes; 119
      except that strong assurance, which, under the most desperate
      circumstances, the independent mind may derive from the contempt
      of fortune and of life. The triumph of Eugenius was celebrated by
      the insolent and dissolute joy of his camp; whilst the active and
      vigilant Arbogastes secretly detached a considerable body of
      troops to occupy the passes of the mountains, and to encompass
      the rear of the Eastern army. The dawn of day discovered to the
      eyes of Theodosius the extent and the extremity of his danger;
      but his apprehensions were soon dispelled, by a friendly message
      from the leaders of those troops who expressed their inclination
      to desert the standard of the tyrant. The honorable and lucrative
      rewards, which they stipulated as the price of their perfidy,
      were granted without hesitation; and as ink and paper could not
      easily be procured, the emperor subscribed, on his own tablets,
      the ratification of the treaty. The spirit of his soldiers was
      revived by this seasonable reenforcement; and they again marched,
      with confidence, to surprise the camp of a tyrant, whose
      principal officers appeared to distrust, either the justice or
      the success of his arms. In the heat of the battle, a violent
      tempest, 120 such as is often felt among the Alps, suddenly arose
      from the East. The army of Theodosius was sheltered by their
      position from the impetuosity of the wind, which blew a cloud of
      dust in the faces of the enemy, disordered their ranks, wrested
      their weapons from their hands, and diverted, or repelled, their
      ineffectual javelins. This accidental advantage was skilfully
      improved, the violence of the storm was magnified by the
      superstitious terrors of the Gauls; and they yielded without
      shame to the invisible powers of heaven, who seemed to militate
      on the side of the pious emperor. His victory was decisive; and
      the deaths of his two rivals were distinguished only by the
      difference of their characters. The rhetorician Eugenius, who had
      almost acquired the dominion of the world, was reduced to implore
      the mercy of the conqueror; and the unrelenting soldiers
      separated his head from his body as he lay prostrate at the feet
      of Theodosius. Arbogastes, after the loss of a battle, in which
      he had discharged the duties of a soldier and a general, wandered
      several days among the mountains. But when he was convinced that
      his cause was desperate, and his escape impracticable, the
      intrepid Barbarian imitated the example of the ancient Romans,
      and turned his sword against his own breast. The fate of the
      empire was determined in a narrow corner of Italy; and the
      legitimate successor of the house of Valentinian embraced the
      archbishop of Milan, and graciously received the submission of
      the provinces of the West. Those provinces were involved in the
      guilt of rebellion; while the inflexible courage of Ambrose alone
      had resisted the claims of successful usurpation. With a manly
      freedom, which might have been fatal to any other subject, the
      archbishop rejected the gifts of Eugenius, 1201 declined his
      correspondence, and withdrew himself from Milan, to avoid the
      odious presence of a tyrant, whose downfall he predicted in
      discreet and ambiguous language. The merit of Ambrose was
      applauded by the conqueror, who secured the attachment of the
      people by his alliance with the church; and the clemency of
      Theodosius is ascribed to the humane intercession of the
      archbishop of Milan. 121

      After the defeat of Eugenius, the merit, as well as the
      authority, of Theodosius was cheerfully acknowledged by all the
      inhabitants of the Roman world. The experience of his past
      conduct encouraged the most pleasing expectations of his future
      reign; and the age of the emperor, which did not exceed fifty
      years, seemed to extend the prospect of the public felicity. His
      death, only four months after his victory, was considered by the
      people as an unforeseen and fatal event, which destroyed, in a
      moment, the hopes of the rising generation. But the indulgence of
      ease and luxury had secretly nourished the principles of disease.
      122 The strength of Theodosius was unable to support the sudden
      and violent transition from the palace to the camp; and the
      increasing symptoms of a dropsy announced the speedy dissolution
      of the emperor. The opinion, and perhaps the interest, of the
      public had confirmed the division of the Eastern and Western
      empires; and the two royal youths, Arcadius and Honorius, who had
      already obtained, from the tenderness of their father, the title
      of Augustus, were destined to fill the thrones of Constantinople
      and of Rome. Those princes were not permitted to share the danger
      and glory of the civil war; 123 but as soon as Theodosius had
      triumphed over his unworthy rivals, he called his younger son,
      Honorius, to enjoy the fruits of the victory, and to receive the
      sceptre of the West from the hands of his dying father. The
      arrival of Honorius at Milan was welcomed by a splendid
      exhibition of the games of the Circus; and the emperor, though he
      was oppressed by the weight of his disorder, contributed by his
      presence to the public joy. But the remains of his strength were
      exhausted by the painful effort which he made to assist at the
      spectacles of the morning. Honorius supplied, during the rest of
      the day, the place of his father; and the great Theodosius
      expired in the ensuing night. Notwithstanding the recent
      animosities of a civil war, his death was universally lamented.
      The Barbarians, whom he had vanquished and the churchmen, by whom
      he had been subdued, celebrated, with loud and sincere applause,
      the qualities of the deceased emperor, which appeared the most
      valuable in their eyes. The Romans were terrified by the
      impending dangers of a feeble and divided administration, and
      every disgraceful moment of the unfortunate reigns of Arcadius
      and Honorius revived the memory of their irreparable loss.

      to the fatigues of war, is represented by Philostorgius (l. xi.

      calls him an impudent liar, (Godefroy, Dissert. p. 438.)]

      123 (return) [ Zosimus supposes, that the boy Honorius
      accompanied his father, (l. iv. p. 280.) Yet the quanto
      flagrabrant pectora voto is all that flattery would allow to a
      contemporary poet; who clearly describes the emperor’s refusal,
      and the journey of Honorius, after the victory (Claudian in iii.
      Cons. 78-125.)]

      In the faithful picture of the virtues of Theodosius, his
      imperfections have not been dissembled; the act of cruelty, and
      the habits of indolence, which tarnished the glory of one of the
      greatest of the Roman princes. An historian, perpetually adverse
      to the fame of Theodosius, has exaggerated his vices, and their
      pernicious effects; he boldly asserts, that every rank of
      subjects imitated the effeminate manners of their sovereign; and
      that every species of corruption polluted the course of public
      and private life; and that the feeble restraints of order and
      decency were insufficient to resist the progress of that
      degenerate spirit, which sacrifices, without a blush, the
      consideration of duty and interest to the base indulgence of
      sloth and appetite. 124 The complaints of contemporary writers,
      who deplore the increase of luxury, and depravation of manners,
      are commonly expressive of their peculiar temper and situation.
      There are few observers, who possess a clear and comprehensive
      view of the revolutions of society; and who are capable of
      discovering the nice and secret springs of action, which impel,
      in the same uniform direction, the blind and capricious passions
      of a multitude of individuals. If it can be affirmed, with any
      degree of truth, that the luxury of the Romans was more shameless
      and dissolute in the reign of Theodosius than in the age of
      Constantine, perhaps, or of Augustus, the alteration cannot be
      ascribed to any beneficial improvements, which had gradually
      increased the stock of national riches. A long period of calamity
      or decay must have checked the industry, and diminished the
      wealth, of the people; and their profuse luxury must have been
      the result of that indolent despair, which enjoys the present
      hour, and declines the thoughts of futurity. The uncertain
      condition of their property discouraged the subjects of
      Theodosius from engaging in those useful and laborious
      undertakings which require an immediate expense, and promise a
      slow and distant advantage. The frequent examples of ruin and
      desolation tempted them not to spare the remains of a patrimony,
      which might, every hour, become the prey of the rapacious Goth.
      And the mad prodigality which prevails in the confusion of a
      shipwreck, or a siege, may serve to explain the progress of
      luxury amidst the misfortunes and terrors of a sinking nation.

      The effeminate luxury, which infected the manners of courts and
      cities, had instilled a secret and destructive poison into the
      camps of the legions; and their degeneracy has been marked by the
      pen of a military writer, who had accurately studied the genuine
      and ancient principles of Roman discipline. It is the just and
      important observation of Vegetius, that the infantry was
      invariably covered with defensive armor, from the foundation of
      the city, to the reign of the emperor Gratian. The relaxation of
      discipline, and the disuse of exercise, rendered the soldiers
      less able, and less willing, to support the fatigues of the
      service; they complained of the weight of the armor, which they
      seldom wore; and they successively obtained the permission of
      laying aside both their cuirasses and their helmets. The heavy
      weapons of their ancestors, the short sword, and the formidable
      pilum, which had subdued the world, insensibly dropped from their
      feeble hands. As the use of the shield is incompatible with that
      of the bow, they reluctantly marched into the field; condemned to
      suffer either the pain of wounds, or the ignominy of flight, and
      always disposed to prefer the more shameful alternative. The
      cavalry of the Goths, the Huns, and the Alani, had felt the
      benefits, and adopted the use, of defensive armor; and, as they
      excelled in the management of missile weapons, they easily
      overwhelmed the naked and trembling legions, whose heads and
      breasts were exposed, without defence, to the arrows of the
      Barbarians. The loss of armies, the destruction of cities, and
      the dishonor of the Roman name, ineffectually solicited the
      successors of Gratian to restore the helmets and the cuirasses of
      the infantry. The enervated soldiers abandoned their own and the
      public defence; and their pusillanimous indolence may be
      considered as the immediate cause of the downfall of the empire.
