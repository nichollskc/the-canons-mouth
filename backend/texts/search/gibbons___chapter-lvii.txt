      From the Isle of Sicily, the reader must transport himself beyond
      the Caspian Sea, to the original seat of the Turks or Turkmans,
      against whom the first crusade was principally directed. Their
      Scythian empire of the sixth century was long since dissolved;
      but the name was still famous among the Greeks and Orientals; and
      the fragments of the nation, each a powerful and independent
      people, were scattered over the desert from China to the Oxus and
      the Danube: the colony of Hungarians was admitted into the
      republic of Europe, and the thrones of Asia were occupied by
      slaves and soldiers of Turkish extraction. While Apulia and
      Sicily were subdued by the Norman lance, a swarm of these
      northern shepherds overspread the kingdoms of Persia; their
      princes of the race of Seljuk erected a splendid and solid empire
      from Samarcand to the confines of Greece and Egypt; and the Turks
      have maintained their dominion in Asia Minor, till the victorious
      crescent has been planted on the dome of St. Sophia.

      One of the greatest of the Turkish princes was Mahmood or Mahmud,
      1 the Gaznevide, who reigned in the eastern provinces of Persia,
      one thousand years after the birth of Christ. His father
      Sebectagi was the slave of the slave of the slave of the
      commander of the faithful. But in this descent of servitude, the
      first degree was merely titular, since it was filled by the
      sovereign of Transoxiana and Chorasan, who still paid a nominal
      allegiance to the caliph of Bagdad. The second rank was that of a
      minister of state, a lieutenant of the Samanides, 2 who broke, by
      his revolt, the bonds of political slavery. But the third step
      was a state of real and domestic servitude in the family of that
      rebel; from which Sebectagi, by his courage and dexterity,
      ascended to the supreme command of the city and provinces of
      Gazna, 3 as the son-in-law and successor of his grateful master.

      The falling dynasty of the Samanides was at first protected, and
      at last overthrown, by their servants; and, in the public
      disorders, the fortune of Mahmud continually increased. From him
      the title of Sultan 4 was first invented; and his kingdom was
      enlarged from Transoxiana to the neighborhood of Ispahan, from
      the shores of the Caspian to the mouth of the Indus. But the
      principal source of his fame and riches was the holy war which he
      waged against the Gentoos of Hindostan. In this foreign narrative
      I may not consume a page; and a volume would scarcely suffice to
      recapitulate the battles and sieges of his twelve expeditions.
      Never was the Mussulman hero dismayed by the inclemency of the
      seasons, the height of the mountains, the breadth of the rivers,
      the barrenness of the desert, the multitudes of the enemy, or the
      formidable array of their elephants of war. 5 The sultan of Gazna
      surpassed the limits of the conquests of Alexander: after a march
      of three months, over the hills of Cashmir and Thibet, he reached
      the famous city of Kinnoge, 6 on the Upper Ganges; and, in a
      naval combat on one of the branches of the Indus, he fought and
      vanquished four thousand boats of the natives. Delhi, Lahor, and
      Multan, were compelled to open their gates: the fertile kingdom
      of Guzarat attracted his ambition and tempted his stay; and his
      avarice indulged the fruitless project of discovering the golden
      and aromatic isles of the Southern Ocean. On the payment of a
      tribute, the rajahs preserved their dominions; the people, their
      lives and fortunes; but to the religion of Hindostan the zealous
      Mussulman was cruel and inexorable: many hundred temples, or
      pagodas, were levelled with the ground; many thousand idols were
      demolished; and the servants of the prophet were stimulated and
      rewarded by the precious materials of which they were composed.
      The pagoda of Sumnat was situate on the promontory of Guzarat, in
      the neighborhood of Diu, one of the last remaining possessions of
      the Portuguese. 7 It was endowed with the revenue of two thousand
      villages; two thousand Brahmins were consecrated to the service
      of the Deity, whom they washed each morning and evening in water
      from the distant Ganges: the subordinate ministers consisted of
      three hundred musicians, three hundred barbers, and five hundred
      dancing girls, conspicuous for their birth or beauty. Three sides
      of the temple were protected by the ocean, the narrow isthmus was
      fortified by a natural or artificial precipice; and the city and
      adjacent country were peopled by a nation of fanatics. They
      confessed the sins and the punishment of Kinnoge and Delhi; but
      if the impious stranger should presume to approach their holy
      precincts, he would surely be overwhelmed by a blast of the
      divine vengeance. By this challenge, the faith of Mahmud was
      animated to a personal trial of the strength of this Indian
      deity. Fifty thousand of his worshippers were pierced by the
      spear of the Moslems; the walls were scaled; the sanctuary was
      profaned; and the conqueror aimed a blow of his iron mace at the
      head of the idol. The trembling Brahmins are said to have offered
      ten millions 711 sterling for his ransom; and it was urged by the
      wisest counsellors, that the destruction of a stone image would
      not change the hearts of the Gentoos; and that such a sum might
      be dedicated to the relief of the true believers. “Your reasons,”
      replied the sultan, “are specious and strong; but never in the
      eyes of posterity shall Mahmud appear as a merchant of idols.”
      712 He repeated his blows, and a treasure of pearls and rubies,
      concealed in the belly of the statue, explained in some degree
      the devout prodigality of the Brahmins. The fragments of the idol
      were distributed to Gazna, Mecca, and Medina. Bagdad listened to
      the edifying tale; and Mahmud was saluted by the caliph with the
      title of guardian of the fortune and faith of Mahomet.

      countryman Colonel Alexander Dow, (vol. i. p. 23-83.) In the two
      first volumes of his History of Hindostan, he styles himself the
      translator of the Persian Ferishta; but in his florid text, it is
      not easy to distinguish the version and the original. * Note: The
      European reader now possesses a more accurate version of
      Ferishta, that of Col. Briggs. Of Col. Dow’s work, Col. Briggs
      observes, “that the author’s name will be handed down to
      posterity as one of the earliest and most indefatigable of our
      Oriental scholars. Instead of confining himself, however, to mere
      translation, he has filled his work with his own observations,
      which have been so embodied in the text that Gibbon declares it
      impossible to distinguish the translator from the original
      author.” Preface p. vii.—M.]

      familiarly employed in the Greek and Latin languages, after it
      had passed from the Gaznevides to the Seljukides, and other emirs
      of Asia and Egypt. Ducange (Dissertation xvi. sur Joinville, p.
      238-240. Gloss. Graec. et Latin.) labors to find the title of
      Sultan in the ancient kingdom of Persia: but his proofs are mere
      shadows; a proper name in the Themes of Constantine, (ii. 11,) an
      anticipation of Zonaras, &c., and a medal of Kai Khosrou, not (as
      he believes) the Sassanide of the vith, but the Seljukide of

      must desire to scrutinize first the text, and then the authority
      of Ferishta, who lived in the Mogul court in the last century. *

      (arrow.) But no Persian or Arabic history speaks of gunpowder
      before the time usually assigned for its invention, (A.D. 1317;)

      a note at the bottom of the page, “ten millions,” which is the
      explanation of the word “crore.” Mr. Gibbon says rashly that the
      sum offered by the Brahmins was ten millions sterling. Note to
      Mill’s India, vol. ii. p. 222. Col. Briggs’s translation is “a
      quantity of gold.” The treasure found in the temple, “perhaps in
      the image,” according to Major Price’s authorities, was twenty
      millions of dinars of gold, above nine millions sterling; but
      this was a hundred-fold the ransom offered by the Brahmins.

      712 (return) [ Rather than the idol broker, he chose to be called
      Mahmud the idol breaker. Price, vol. ii. p. 289—M]

      From the paths of blood (and such is the history of nations) I
      cannot refuse to turn aside to gather some flowers of science or
      virtue. The name of Mahmud the Gaznevide is still venerable in
      the East: his subjects enjoyed the blessings of prosperity and
      peace; his vices were concealed by the veil of religion; and two
      familiar examples will testify his justice and magnanimity.

      I. As he sat in the Divan, an unhappy subject bowed before the
      throne to accuse the insolence of a Turkish soldier who had
      driven him from his house and bed. “Suspend your clamors,” said
      Mahmud; “inform me of his next visit, and ourself in person will
      judge and punish the offender.” The sultan followed his guide,
      invested the house with his guards, and extinguishing the
      torches, pronounced the death of the criminal, who had been
      seized in the act of rapine and adultery. After the execution of
      his sentence, the lights were rekindled, Mahmud fell prostrate in
      prayer, and rising from the ground, demanded some homely fare,
      which he devoured with the voraciousness of hunger. The poor man,
      whose injury he had avenged, was unable to suppress his
      astonishment and curiosity; and the courteous monarch
      condescended to explain the motives of this singular behavior. “I
      had reason to suspect that none, except one of my sons, could
      dare to perpetrate such an outrage; and I extinguished the
      lights, that my justice might be blind and inexorable. My prayer
      was a thanksgiving on the discovery of the offender; and so
      painful was my anxiety, that I had passed three days without food
      since the first moment of your complaint.”

      II. The sultan of Gazna had declared war against the dynasty of
      the Bowides, the sovereigns of the western Persia: he was
      disarmed by an epistle of the sultana mother, and delayed his
      invasion till the manhood of her son. 8 “During the life of my
      husband,” said the artful regent, “I was ever apprehensive of
      your ambition: he was a prince and a soldier worthy of your arms.
      He is now no more; his sceptre has passed to a woman and a child,
      and you dare not attack their infancy and weakness. How
      inglorious would be your conquest, how shameful your defeat! and
      yet the event of war is in the hand of the Almighty.” Avarice was
      the only defect that tarnished the illustrious character of
      Mahmud; and never has that passion been more richly satiated. 811
      The Orientals exceed the measure of credibility in the account of
      millions of gold and silver, such as the avidity of man has never
      accumulated; in the magnitude of pearls, diamonds, and rubies,
      such as have never been produced by the workmanship of nature. 9
      Yet the soil of Hindostan is impregnated with precious minerals:
      her trade, in every age, has attracted the gold and silver of the
      world; and her virgin spoils were rifled by the first of the
      Mahometan conquerors. His behavior, in the last days of his life,
      evinces the vanity of these possessions, so laboriously won, so
      dangerously held, and so inevitably lost. He surveyed the vast
      and various chambers of the treasury of Gazna, burst into tears,
      and again closed the doors, without bestowing any portion of the
      wealth which he could no longer hope to preserve. The following
      day he reviewed the state of his military force; one hundred
      thousand foot, fifty-five thousand horse, and thirteen hundred
      elephants of battle. 10 He again wept the instability of human
      greatness; and his grief was imbittered by the hostile progress
      of the Turkmans, whom he had introduced into the heart of his
      Persian kingdom.

      8 (return) [ D’Herbelot, Bibliotheque Orientale, p. 527. Yet

      miskals, (Dow, vol. i. p. 53,) or six pounds three ounces: the
      largest in the treasury of Delhi weighed seventeen miskals,
      (Voyages de Tavernier, partie ii. p. 280.) It is true, that in
      the East all colored stones are calied rubies, (p. 355,) and that
      Tavernier saw three larger and more precious among the jewels de
      notre grand roi, le plus puissant et plus magnifique de tous les
      rois de la terre, (p. 376.)]

      10 (return) [ Dow, vol. i. p. 65. The sovereign of Kinoge is said
      to have possessed 2500 elephants, (Abulfed. Geograph. tab. xv. p.
      274.) From these Indian stories, the reader may correct a note in
      my first volume, (p. 245;) or from that note he may correct these
      stories.]

      In the modern depopulation of Asia, the regular operation of
      government and agriculture is confined to the neighborhood of
      cities; and the distant country is abandoned to the pastoral
      tribes of Arabs, Curds, and Turkmans. 11 Of the last-mentioned
      people, two considerable branches extend on either side of the
      Caspian Sea: the western colony can muster forty thousand
      soldiers; the eastern, less obvious to the traveller, but more
      strong and populous, has increased to the number of one hundred
      thousand families. In the midst of civilized nations, they
      preserve the manners of the Scythian desert, remove their
      encampments with a change of seasons, and feed their cattle among
      the ruins of palaces and temples. Their flocks and herds are
      their only riches; their tents, either black or white, according
      to the color of the banner, are covered with felt, and of a
      circular form; their winter apparel is a sheep-skin; a robe of
      cloth or cotton their summer garment: the features of the men are
      harsh and ferocious; the countenance of their women is soft and
      pleasing. Their wandering life maintains the spirit and exercise
      of arms; they fight on horseback; and their courage is displayed
      in frequent contests with each other and with their neighbors.
      For the license of pasture they pay a slight tribute to the
      sovereign of the land; but the domestic jurisdiction is in the
      hands of the chiefs and elders. The first emigration of the
      Eastern Turkmans, the most ancient of the race, may be ascribed
      to the tenth century of the Christian aera. 12 In the decline of
      the caliphs, and the weakness of their lieutenants, the barrier
      of the Jaxartes was often violated; in each invasion, after the
      victory or retreat of their countrymen, some wandering tribe,
      embracing the Mahometan faith, obtained a free encampment in the
      spacious plains and pleasant climate of Transoxiana and Carizme.
      The Turkish slaves who aspired to the throne encouraged these
      emigrations which recruited their armies, awed their subjects and
      rivals, and protected the frontier against the wilder natives of
      Turkestan; and this policy was abused by Mahmud the Gaznevide
      beyond the example of former times. He was admonished of his
      error by the chief of the race of Seljuk, who dwelt in the
      territory of Bochara. The sultan had inquired what supply of men
      he could furnish for military service. “If you send,” replied
      Ismael, “one of these arrows into our camp, fifty thousand of
      your servants will mount on horseback.”—“And if that number,”
      continued Mahmud, “should not be sufficient?”—“Send this second
      arrow to the horde of Balik, and you will find fifty thousand
      more.”—“But,” said the Gaznevide, dissembling his anxiety, “if I
      should stand in need of the whole force of your kindred
      tribes?”—“Despatch my bow,” was the last reply of Ismael, “and as
      it is circulated around, the summons will be obeyed by two
      hundred thousand horse.” The apprehension of such formidable
      friendship induced Mahmud to transport the most obnoxious tribes
      into the heart of Chorasan, where they would be separated from
      their brethren of the River Oxus, and enclosed on all sides by
      the walls of obedient cities. But the face of the country was an
      object of temptation rather than terror; and the vigor of
      government was relaxed by the absence and death of the sultan of
      Gazna. The shepherds were converted into robbers; the bands of
      robbers were collected into an army of conquerors: as far as
      Ispahan and the Tigris, Persia was afflicted by their predatory
      inroads; and the Turkmans were not ashamed or afraid to measure
      their courage and numbers with the proudest sovereigns of Asia.
      Massoud, the son and successor of Mahmud, had too long neglected
      the advice of his wisest Omrahs. “Your enemies,” they repeatedly
      urged, “were in their origin a swarm of ants; they are now little
      snakes; and, unless they be instantly crushed, they will acquire
      the venom and magnitude of serpents.” After some alternatives of
      truce and hostility, after the repulse or partial success of his
      lieutenants, the sultan marched in person against the Turkmans,
      who attacked him on all sides with barbarous shouts and irregular
      onset. “Massoud,” says the Persian historian, 13 “plunged singly
      to oppose the torrent of gleaming arms, exhibiting such acts of
      gigantic force and valor as never king had before displayed. A
      few of his friends, roused by his words and actions, and that
      innate honor which inspires the brave, seconded their lord so
      well, that wheresoever he turned his fatal sword, the enemies
      were mowed down, or retreated before him. But now, when victory
      seemed to blow on his standard, misfortune was active behind it;
      for when he looked round, be beheld almost his whole army,
      excepting that body he commanded in person, devouring the paths
      of flight.” The Gaznevide was abandoned by the cowardice or
      treachery of some generals of Turkish race; and this memorable
      day of Zendecan 14 founded in Persia the dynasty of the shepherd
      kings. 15

      have confounded, in this revolution, the truth of time and place,
      of names and persons, of causes and events. The ignorance and
      errors of these Greeks (which I shall not stop to unravel) may
      inspire some distrust of the story of Cyaxares and Cyrus, as it
      is told by their most eloquent predecessor.]

      The victorious Turkmans immediately proceeded to the election of
      a king; and, if the probable tale of a Latin historian 16
      deserves any credit, they determined by lot the choice of their
      new master. A number of arrows were successively inscribed with
      the name of a tribe, a family, and a candidate; they were drawn
      from the bundle by the hand of a child; and the important prize
      was obtained by Togrul Beg, the son of Michael the son of Seljuk,
      whose surname was immortalized in the greatness of his posterity.
      The sultan Mahmud, who valued himself on his skill in national
      genealogy, professed his ignorance of the family of Seljuk; yet
      the father of that race appears to have been a chief of power and
      renown. 17 For a daring intrusion into the harem of his prince,
      Seljuk was banished from Turkestan: with a numerous tribe of his
      friends and vassals, he passed the Jaxartes, encamped in the
      neighborhood of Samarcand, embraced the religion of Mahomet, and
      acquired the crown of martyrdom in a war against the infidels.
      His age, of a hundred and seven years, surpassed the life of his
      son, and Seljuk adopted the care of his two grandsons, Togrul and
      Jaafar; the eldest of whom, at the age of forty-five, was
      invested with the title of Sultan, in the royal city of Nishabur.
      The blind determination of chance was justified by the virtues of
      the successful candidate. It would be superfluous to praise the
      valor of a Turk; and the ambition of Togrul 18 was equal to his
      valor. By his arms, the Gasnevides were expelled from the eastern
      kingdoms of Persia, and gradually driven to the banks of the
      Indus, in search of a softer and more wealthy conquest. In the
      West he annihilated the dynasty of the Bowides; and the sceptre
      of Irak passed from the Persian to the Turkish nation. The
      princes who had felt, or who feared, the Seljukian arrows, bowed
      their heads in the dust; by the conquest of Aderbijan, or Media,
      he approached the Roman confines; and the shepherd presumed to
      despatch an ambassador, or herald, to demand the tribute and
      obedience of the emperor of Constantinople. 19 In his own
      dominions, Togrul was the father of his soldiers and people; by a
      firm and equal administration, Persia was relieved from the evils
      of anarchy; and the same hands which had been imbrued in blood
      became the guardians of justice and the public peace. The more
      rustic, perhaps the wisest, portion of the Turkmans 20 continued
      to dwell in the tents of their ancestors; and, from the Oxus to
      the Euphrates, these military colonies were protected and
      propagated by their native princes. But the Turks of the court
      and city were refined by business and softened by pleasure: they
      imitated the dress, language, and manners of Persia; and the
      royal palaces of Nishabur and Rei displayed the order and
      magnificence of a great monarchy. The most deserving of the
      Arabians and Persians were promoted to the honors of the state;
      and the whole body of the Turkish nation embraced, with fervor
      and sincerity, the religion of Mahomet. The northern swarms of
      Barbarians, who overspread both Europe and Asia, have been
      irreconcilably separated by the consequences of a similar
      conduct. Among the Moslems, as among the Christians, their vague
      and local traditions have yielded to the reason and authority of
      the prevailing system, to the fame of antiquity, and the consent
      of nations. But the triumph of the Koran is more pure and
      meritorious, as it was not assisted by any visible splendor of
      worship which might allure the Pagans by some resemblance of
      idolatry. The first of the Seljukian sultans was conspicuous by
      his zeal and faith: each day he repeated the five prayers which
      are enjoined to the true believers; of each week, the two first
      days were consecrated by an extraordinary fast; and in every city
      a mosch was completed, before Togrul presumed to lay the
      foundations of a palace. 21

      With the belief of the Koran, the son of Seljuk imbibed a lively
      reverence for the successor of the prophet. But that sublime
      character was still disputed by the caliphs of Bagdad and Egypt,
      and each of the rivals was solicitous to prove his title in the
      judgment of the strong, though illiterate Barbarians. Mahmud the
      Gaznevide had declared himself in favor of the line of Abbas; and
      had treated with indignity the robe of honor which was presented
      by the Fatimite ambassador. Yet the ungrateful Hashemite had
      changed with the change of fortune; he applauded the victory of
      Zendecan, and named the Seljukian sultan his temporal vicegerent
      over the Moslem world. As Togrul executed and enlarged this
      important trust, he was called to the deliverance of the caliph
      Cayem, and obeyed the holy summons, which gave a new kingdom to
      his arms. 22 In the palace of Bagdad, the commander of the
      faithful still slumbered, a venerable phantom. His servant or
      master, the prince of the Bowides, could no longer protect him
      from the insolence of meaner tyrants; and the Euphrates and
      Tigris were oppressed by the revolt of the Turkish and Arabian
      emirs. The presence of a conqueror was implored as a blessing;
      and the transient mischiefs of fire and sword were excused as the
      sharp but salutary remedies which alone could restore the health
      of the republic. At the head of an irresistible force, the sultan
      of Persia marched from Hamadan: the proud were crushed, the
      prostrate were spared; the prince of the Bowides disappeared; the
      heads of the most obstinate rebels were laid at the feet of
      Togrul; and he inflicted a lesson of obedience on the people of
      Mosul and Bagdad. After the chastisement of the guilty, and the
      restoration of peace, the royal shepherd accepted the reward of
      his labors; and a solemn comedy represented the triumph of
      religious prejudice over Barbarian power. 23 The Turkish sultan
      embarked on the Tigris, landed at the gate of Racca, and made his
      public entry on horseback. At the palace-gate he respectfully
      dismounted, and walked on foot, preceded by his emirs without
      arms. The caliph was seated behind his black veil: the black
      garment of the Abbassides was cast over his shoulders, and he
      held in his hand the staff of the apostle of God. The conqueror
      of the East kissed the ground, stood some time in a modest
      posture, and was led towards the throne by the vizier and
      interpreter. After Togrul had seated himself on another throne,
      his commission was publicly read, which declared him the temporal
      lieutenant of the vicar of the prophet. He was successively
      invested with seven robes of honor, and presented with seven
      slaves, the natives of the seven climates of the Arabian empire.
      His mystic veil was perfumed with musk; two crowns 231 were
      placed on his head; two cimeters were girded to his side, as the
      symbols of a double reign over the East and West. After this
      inauguration, the sultan was prevented from prostrating himself a
      second time; but he twice kissed the hand of the commander of the
      faithful, and his titles were proclaimed by the voice of heralds
      and the applause of the Moslems. In a second visit to Bagdad, the
      Seljukian prince again rescued the caliph from his enemies and
      devoutly, on foot, led the bridle of his mule from the prison to
      the palace. Their alliance was cemented by the marriage of
      Togrul’s sister with the successor of the prophet. Without
      reluctance he had introduced a Turkish virgin into his harem; but
      Cayem proudly refused his daughter to the sultan, disdained to
      mingle the blood of the Hashemites with the blood of a Scythian
      shepherd; and protracted the negotiation many months, till the
      gradual diminution of his revenue admonished him that he was
      still in the hands of a master. The royal nuptials were followed
      by the death of Togrul himself; 24 as he left no children, his
      nephew Alp Arslan succeeded to the title and prerogatives of
      sultan; and his name, after that of the caliph, was pronounced in
      the public prayers of the Moslems. Yet in this revolution, the
      Abbassides acquired a larger measure of liberty and power. On the
      throne of Asia, the Turkish monarchs were less jealous of the
      domestic administration of Bagdad; and the commanders of the
      faithful were relieved from the ignominious vexations to which
      they had been exposed by the presence and poverty of the Persian
      dynasty.

      Chapter LVII: The Turks.—Part II.

      Since the fall of the caliphs, the discord and degeneracy of the
      Saracens respected the Asiatic provinces of Rome; which, by the
      victories of Nicephorus, Zimisces, and Basil, had been extended
      as far as Antioch and the eastern boundaries of Armenia.

      Twenty-five years after the death of Basil, his successors were
      suddenly assaulted by an unknown race of Barbarians, who united
      the Scythian valor with the fanaticism of new proselytes, and the
      art and riches of a powerful monarchy. 25 The myriads of Turkish
      horse overspread a frontier of six hundred miles from Tauris to
      Arzeroum, and the blood of one hundred and thirty thousand
      Christians was a grateful sacrifice to the Arabian prophet. Yet
      the arms of Togrul did not make any deep or lasting impression on
      the Greek empire. The torrent rolled away from the open country;
      the sultan retired without glory or success from the siege of an
      Armenian city; the obscure hostilities were continued or
      suspended with a vicissitude of events; and the bravery of the
      Macedonian legions renewed the fame of the conqueror of Asia. 26
      The name of Alp Arslan, the valiant lion, is expressive of the
      popular idea of the perfection of man; and the successor of
      Togrul displayed the fierceness and generosity of the royal
      animal. He passed the Euphrates at the head of the Turkish
      cavalry, and entered Caesarea, the metropolis of Cappadocia, to
      which he had been attracted by the fame and wealth of the temple
      of St. Basil. The solid structure resisted the destroyer: but he
      carried away the doors of the shrine incrusted with gold and
      pearls, and profaned the relics of the tutelar saint, whose
      mortal frailties were now covered by the venerable rust of
      antiquity. The final conquest of Armenia and Georgia was achieved
      by Alp Arslan. In Armenia, the title of a kingdom, and the spirit
      of a nation, were annihilated: the artificial fortifications were
      yielded by the mercenaries of Constantinople; by strangers
      without faith, veterans without pay or arms, and recruits without
      experience or discipline. The loss of this important frontier was
      the news of a day; and the Catholics were neither surprised nor
      displeased, that a people so deeply infected with the Nestorian
      and Eutychian errors had been delivered by Christ and his mother
      into the hands of the infidels. 27 The woods and valleys of Mount
      Caucasus were more strenuously defended by the native Georgians
      28 or Iberians; but the Turkish sultan and his son Malek were
      indefatigable in this holy war: their captives were compelled to
      promise a spiritual, as well as temporal, obedience; and, instead
      of their collars and bracelets, an iron horseshoe, a badge of
      ignominy, was imposed on the infidels who still adhered to the
      worship of their fathers. The change, however, was not sincere or
      universal; and, through ages of servitude, the Georgians have
      maintained the succession of their princes and bishops. But a
      race of men, whom nature has cast in her most perfect mould, is
      degraded by poverty, ignorance, and vice; their profession, and
      still more their practice, of Christianity is an empty name; and
      if they have emerged from heresy, it is only because they are too
      illiterate to remember a metaphysical creed. 29

      Guignes, (tom. i. p. 433-438.)]

      The false or genuine magnanimity of Mahmud the Gaznevide was not
      imitated by Alp Arslan; and he attacked without scruple the Greek
      empress Eudocia and her children. His alarming progress compelled
      her to give herself and her sceptre to the hand of a soldier; and
      Romanus Diogenes was invested with the Imperial purple. His
      patriotism, and perhaps his pride, urged him from Constantinople
      within two months after his accession; and the next campaign he
      most scandalously took the field during the holy festival of
      Easter. In the palace, Diogenes was no more than the husband of
      Eudocia: in the camp, he was the emperor of the Romans, and he
      sustained that character with feeble resources and invincible
      courage. By his spirit and success the soldiers were taught to
      act, the subjects to hope, and the enemies to fear. The Turks had
      penetrated into the heart of Phrygia; but the sultan himself had
      resigned to his emirs the prosecution of the war; and their
      numerous detachments were scattered over Asia in the security of
      conquest. Laden with spoil, and careless of discipline, they were
      separately surprised and defeated by the Greeks: the activity of
      the emperor seemed to multiply his presence: and while they heard
      of his expedition to Antioch, the enemy felt his sword on the
      hills of Trebizond. In three laborious campaigns, the Turks were
      driven beyond the Euphrates; in the fourth and last, Romanus
      undertook the deliverance of Armenia. The desolation of the land
      obliged him to transport a supply of two months’ provisions; and
      he marched forwards to the siege of Malazkerd, 30 an important
      fortress in the midway between the modern cities of Arzeroum and
      Van. His army amounted, at the least, to one hundred thousand
      men. The troops of Constantinople were reenforced by the
      disorderly multitudes of Phrygia and Cappadocia; but the real
      strength was composed of the subjects and allies of Europe, the
      legions of Macedonia, and the squadrons of Bulgaria; the Uzi, a
      Moldavian horde, who were themselves of the Turkish race; 31 and,
      above all, the mercenary and adventurous bands of French and
      Normans. Their lances were commanded by the valiant Ursel of
      Baliol, the kinsman or father of the Scottish kings, 32 and were
      allowed to excel in the exercise of arms, or, according to the
      Greek style, in the practice of the Pyrrhic dance.

      has labored the subject in honor of the president de Bailleul,
      whose father had exchanged the sword for the gown.]

      On the report of this bold invasion, which threatened his
      hereditary dominions, Alp Arslan flew to the scene of action at
      the head of forty thousand horse. 33 His rapid and skilful
      evolutions distressed and dismayed the superior numbers of the
      Greeks; and in the defeat of Basilacius, one of their principal
      generals, he displayed the first example of his valor and
      clemency. The imprudence of the emperor had separated his forces
      after the reduction of Malazkerd. It was in vain that he
      attempted to recall the mercenary Franks: they refused to obey
      his summons; he disdained to await their return: the desertion of
      the Uzi filled his mind with anxiety and suspicion; and against
      the most salutary advice he rushed forwards to speedy and
      decisive action. Had he listened to the fair proposals of the
      sultan, Romanus might have secured a retreat, perhaps a peace;
      but in these overtures he supposed the fear or weakness of the
      enemy, and his answer was conceived in the tone of insult and
      defiance. “If the Barbarian wishes for peace, let him evacuate
      the ground which he occupies for the encampment of the Romans,
      and surrender his city and palace of Rei as a pledge of his
      sincerity.” Alp Arslan smiled at the vanity of the demand, but he
      wept the death of so many faithful Moslems; and, after a devout
      prayer, proclaimed a free permission to all who were desirous of
      retiring from the field. With his own hands he tied up his
      horse’s tail, exchanged his bow and arrows for a mace and
      cimeter, clothed himself in a white garment, perfumed his body
      with musk, and declared that if he were vanquished, that spot
      should be the place of his burial. 34 The sultan himself had
      affected to cast away his missile weapons: but his hopes of
      victory were placed in the arrows of the Turkish cavalry, whose
      squadrons were loosely distributed in the form of a crescent.
      Instead of the successive lines and reserves of the Grecian
      tactics, Romulus led his army in a single and solid phalanx, and
      pressed with vigor and impatience the artful and yielding
      resistance of the Barbarians. In this desultory and fruitless
      combat he spent the greater part of a summer’s day, till prudence
      and fatigue compelled him to return to his camp. But a retreat is
      always perilous in the face of an active foe; and no sooner had
      the standard been turned to the rear than the phalanx was broken
      by the base cowardice, or the baser jealousy, of Andronicus, a
      rival prince, who disgraced his birth and the purple of the
      Caesars. 35 The Turkish squadrons poured a cloud of arrows on
      this moment of confusion and lassitude; and the horns of their
      formidable crescent were closed in the rear of the Greeks. In the
      destruction of the army and pillage of the camp, it would be
      needless to mention the number of the slain or captives. The
      Byzantine writers deplore the loss of an inestimable pearl: they
      forgot to mention, that in this fatal day the Asiatic provinces
      of Rome were irretrievably sacrificed.

      which is reduced by Abulpharagius to 15,000, (p. 227,) and by

      300,000 met to the emperor, of whom Abulpharagius says, Cum
      centum hominum millibus, multisque equis et magna pompa

      p. 30, 38. l. ii. p. 53.) Yet he owns his enmity to Romanus.
      Scylitzes speaks more explicitly of his treason.]

      As long as a hope survived, Romanus attempted to rally and save
      the relics of his army. When the centre, the Imperial station,
      was left naked on all sides, and encompassed by the victorious
      Turks, he still, with desperate courage, maintained the fight
      till the close of day, at the head of the brave and faithful
      subjects who adhered to his standard. They fell around him; his
      horse was slain; the emperor was wounded; yet he stood alone and
      intrepid, till he was oppressed and bound by the strength of
      multitudes. The glory of this illustrious prize was disputed by a
      slave and a soldier; a slave who had seen him on the throne of
      Constantinople, and a soldier whose extreme deformity had been
      excused on the promise of some signal service.

      Despoiled of his arms, his jewels, and his purple, Romanus spent
      a dreary and perilous night on the field of battle, amidst a
      disorderly crowd of the meaner Barbarians. In the morning the
      royal captive was presented to Alp Arslan, who doubted of his
      fortune, till the identity of the person was ascertained by the
      report of his ambassadors, and by the more pathetic evidence of
      Basilacius, who embraced with tears the feet of his unhappy
      sovereign. The successor of Constantine, in a plebeian habit, was
      led into the Turkish divan, and commanded to kiss the ground
      before the lord of Asia. He reluctantly obeyed; and Alp Arslan,
      starting from his throne, is said to have planted his foot on the
      neck of the Roman emperor. 36 But the fact is doubtful; and if,
      in this moment of insolence, the sultan complied with the
      national custom, the rest of his conduct has extorted the praise
      of his bigoted foes, and may afford a lesson to the most
      civilized ages. He instantly raised the royal captive from the
      ground; and thrice clasping his hand with tender sympathy,
      assured him, that his life and dignity should be inviolate in the
      hands of a prince who had learned to respect the majesty of his
      equals and the vicissitudes of fortune. From the divan, Romanus
      was conducted to an adjacent tent, where he was served with pomp
      and reverence by the officers of the sultan, who, twice each day,
      seated him in the place of honor at his own table. In a free and
      familiar conversation of eight days, not a word, not a look, of
      insult escaped from the conqueror; but he severely censured the
      unworthy subjects who had deserted their valiant prince in the
      hour of danger, and gently admonished his antagonist of some
      errors which he had committed in the management of the war. In
      the preliminaries of negotiation, Alp Arslan asked him what
      treatment he expected to receive, and the calm indifference of
      the emperor displays the freedom of his mind. “If you are cruel,”
      said he, “you will take my life; if you listen to pride, you will
      drag me at your chariot-wheels; if you consult your interest, you
      will accept a ransom, and restore me to my country.” “And what,”
      continued the sultan, “would have been your own behavior, had
      fortune smiled on your arms?” The reply of the Greek betrays a
      sentiment, which prudence, and even gratitude, should have taught
      him to suppress. “Had I vanquished,” he fiercely said, “I would
      have inflicted on thy body many a stripe.” The Turkish conqueror
      smiled at the insolence of his captive; observed that the
      Christian law inculcated the love of enemies and forgiveness of
      injuries; and nobly declared, that he would not imitate an
      example which he condemned. After mature deliberation, Alp Arslan
      dictated the terms of liberty and peace, a ransom of a million,
      361 an annual tribute of three hundred and sixty thousand pieces
      of gold, 37 the marriage of the royal children, and the
      deliverance of all the Moslems, who were in the power of the
      Greeks. Romanus, with a sigh, subscribed this treaty, so
      disgraceful to the majesty of the empire; he was immediately
      invested with a Turkish robe of honor; his nobles and patricians
      were restored to their sovereign; and the sultan, after a
      courteous embrace, dismissed him with rich presents and a
      military guard. No sooner did he reach the confines of the
      empire, than he was informed that the palace and provinces had
      disclaimed their allegiance to a captive: a sum of two hundred
      thousand pieces was painfully collected; and the fallen monarch
      transmitted this part of his ransom, with a sad confession of his
      impotence and disgrace. The generosity, or perhaps the ambition,
      of the sultan, prepared to espouse the cause of his ally; but his
      designs were prevented by the defeat, imprisonment, and death, of
      Romanus Diogenes. 38

      of Africa.]

      In the treaty of peace, it does not appear that Alp Arslan
      extorted any province or city from the captive emperor; and his
      revenge was satisfied with the trophies of his victory, and the
      spoils of Anatolia, from Antioch to the Black Sea. The fairest
      part of Asia was subject to his laws: twelve hundred princes, or
      the sons of princes, stood before his throne; and two hundred
      thousand soldiers marched under his banners. The sultan disdained
      to pursue the fugitive Greeks; but he meditated the more glorious
      conquest of Turkestan, the original seat of the house of Seljuk.
      He moved from Bagdad to the banks of the Oxus; a bridge was
      thrown over the river; and twenty days were consumed in the
      passage of his troops. But the progress of the great king was
      retarded by the governor of Berzem; and Joseph the Carizmian
      presumed to defend his fortress against the powers of the East.
      When he was produced a captive in the royal tent, the sultan,
      instead of praising his valor, severely reproached his obstinate
      folly: and the insolent replies of the rebel provoked a sentence,
      that he should be fastened to four stakes, and left to expire in
      that painful situation. At this command, the desperate Carizmian,
      drawing a dagger, rushed headlong towards the throne: the guards
      raised their battle-axes; their zeal was checked by Alp Arslan,
      the most skilful archer of the age: he drew his bow, but his foot
      slipped, the arrow glanced aside, and he received in his breast
      the dagger of Joseph, who was instantly cut in pieces.

      The wound was mortal; and the Turkish prince bequeathed a dying
      admonition to the pride of kings. “In my youth,” said Alp Arslan,
      “I was advised by a sage to humble myself before God; to distrust
      my own strength; and never to despise the most contemptible foe.
      I have neglected these lessons; and my neglect has been
      deservedly punished. Yesterday, as from an eminence I beheld the
      numbers, the discipline, and the spirit, of my armies, the earth
      seemed to tremble under my feet; and I said in my heart, Surely
      thou art the king of the world, the greatest and most invincible
      of warriors. These armies are no longer mine; and, in the
      confidence of my personal strength, I now fall by the hand of an
      assassin.” 39 Alp Arslan possessed the virtues of a Turk and a
      Mussulman; his voice and stature commanded the reverence of
      mankind; his face was shaded with long whiskers; and his ample
      turban was fashioned in the shape of a crown. The remains of the
      sultan were deposited in the tomb of the Seljukian dynasty; and
      the passenger might read and meditate this useful inscription: 40
      “O ye who have seen the glory of Alp Arslan exalted to the
      heavens, repair to Maru, and you will behold it buried in the
      dust.” The annihilation of the inscription, and the tomb itself,
      more forcibly proclaims the instability of human greatness.

      39 (return) [ This interesting death is told by D’Herbelot, (p.
      103, 104,) and M. De Guignes, (tom. iii. p. 212, 213.) from their
      Oriental writers; but neither of them have transfused the spirit
      of Elmacin, (Hist. Saracen p. 344, 345.)]

      40 (return) [ A critic of high renown, (the late Dr. Johnson,)
      who has severely scrutinized the epitaphs of Pope, might cavil in
      this sublime inscription at the words “repair to Maru,” since the
      reader must already be at Maru before he could peruse the
      inscription.]

      During the life of Alp Arslan, his eldest son had been
      acknowledged as the future sultan of the Turks. On his father’s
      death the inheritance was disputed by an uncle, a cousin, and a
      brother: they drew their cimeters, and assembled their followers;
      and the triple victory of Malek Shah 41 established his own
      reputation and the right of primogeniture. In every age, and more
      especially in Asia, the thirst of power has inspired the same
      passions, and occasioned the same disorders; but, from the long
      series of civil war, it would not be easy to extract a sentiment
      more pure and magnanimous than is contained in the saying of the
      Turkish prince. On the eve of the battle, he performed his
      devotions at Thous, before the tomb of the Imam Riza. As the
      sultan rose from the ground, he asked his vizier Nizam, who had
      knelt beside him, what had been the object of his secret
      petition: “That your arms may be crowned with victory,” was the
      prudent, and most probably the sincere, answer of the minister.
      “For my part,” replied the generous Malek, “I implored the Lord
      of Hosts that he would take from me my life and crown, if my
      brother be more worthy than myself to reign over the Moslems.”
      The favorable judgment of heaven was ratified by the caliph; and
      for the first time, the sacred title of Commander of the Faithful
      was communicated to a Barbarian. But this Barbarian, by his
      personal merit, and the extent of his empire, was the greatest
      prince of his age. After the settlement of Persia and Syria, he
      marched at the head of innumerable armies to achieve the conquest
      of Turkestan, which had been undertaken by his father. In his
      passage of the Oxus, the boatmen, who had been employed in
      transporting some troops, complained, that their payment was
      assigned on the revenues of Antioch. The sultan frowned at this
      preposterous choice; but he miled at the artful flattery of his
      vizier. “It was not to postpone their reward, that I selected
      those remote places, but to leave a memorial to posterity, that,
      under your reign, Antioch and the Oxus were subject to the same
      sovereign.” But this description of his limits was unjust and
      parsimonious: beyond the Oxus, he reduced to his obedience the
      cities of Bochara, Carizme, and Samarcand, and crushed each
      rebellious slave, or independent savage, who dared to resist.
      Malek passed the Sihon or Jaxartes, the last boundary of Persian
      civilization: the hordes of Turkestan yielded to his supremacy:
      his name was inserted on the coins, and in the prayers of
      Cashgar, a Tartar kingdom on the extreme borders of China. From
      the Chinese frontier, he stretched his immediate jurisdiction or
      feudatory sway to the west and south, as far as the mountains of
      Georgia, the neighborhood of Constantinople, the holy city of
      Jerusalem, and the spicy groves of Arabia Felix. Instead of
      resigning himself to the luxury of his harem, the shepherd king,
      both in peace and war, was in action and in the field. By the
      perpetual motion of the royal camp, each province was
      successively blessed with his presence; and he is said to have
      perambulated twelve times the wide extent of his dominions, which
      surpassed the Asiatic reign of Cyrus and the caliphs. Of these
      expeditions, the most pious and splendid was the pilgrimage of
      Mecca: the freedom and safety of the caravans were protected by
      his arms; the citizens and pilgrims were enriched by the
      profusion of his alms; and the desert was cheered by the places
      of relief and refreshment, which he instituted for the use of his
      brethren. Hunting was the pleasure, and even the passion, of the
      sultan, and his train consisted of forty-seven thousand horses;
      but after the massacre of a Turkish chase, for each piece of
      game, he bestowed a piece of gold on the poor, a slight
      atonement, at the expense of the people, for the cost and
      mischief of the amusement of kings. In the peaceful prosperity of
      his reign, the cities of Asia were adorned with palaces and
      hospitals with moschs and colleges; few departed from his Divan
      without reward, and none without justice. The language and
      literature of Persia revived under the house of Seljuk; 42 and if
      Malek emulated the liberality of a Turk less potent than himself,
      43 his palace might resound with the songs of a hundred poets.
      The sultan bestowed a more serious and learned care on the
      reformation of the calendar, which was effected by a general
      assembly of the astronomers of the East. By a law of the prophet,
      the Moslems are confined to the irregular course of the lunar
      months; in Persia, since the age of Zoroaster, the revolution of
      the sun has been known and celebrated as an annual festival; 44
      but after the fall of the Magian empire, the intercalation had
      been neglected; the fractions of minutes and hours were
      multiplied into days; and the date of the springs was removed
      from the sign of Aries to that of Pisces. The reign of Malek was
      illustrated by the Gelalaean aera; and all errors, either past or
      future, were corrected by a computation of time, which surpasses
      the Julian, and approaches the accuracy of the Gregorian, style.

      could surpass him in power and pomp. I suspect that the
      beginning, not the end, of the xith century is the true aera of
      his reign.]

      In a period when Europe was plunged in the deepest barbarism, the
      light and splendor of Asia may be ascribed to the docility rather
      than the knowledge of the Turkish conquerors. An ample share of
      their wisdom and virtue is due to a Persian vizier, who ruled the
      empire under the reigns of Alp Arslan and his son. Nizam, one of
      the most illustrious ministers of the East, was honored by the
      caliph as an oracle of religion and science; he was trusted by
      the sultan as the faithful vicegerent of his power and justice.
      After an administration of thirty years, the fame of the vizier,
      his wealth, and even his services, were transformed into crimes.
      He was overthrown by the insidious arts of a woman and a rival;
      and his fall was hastened by a rash declaration, that his cap and
      ink-horn, the badges of his office, were connected by the divine
      decree with the throne and diadem of the sultan. At the age of
      ninety-three years, the venerable statesman was dismissed by his
      master, accused by his enemies, and murdered by a fanatic: 451
      the last words of Nizam attested his innocence, and the remainder
      of Malek’s life was short and inglorious. From Ispahan, the scene
      of this disgraceful transaction, the sultan moved to Bagdad, with
      the design of transplanting the caliph, and of fixing his own
      residence in the capital of the Moslem world. The feeble
      successor of Mahomet obtained a respite of ten days; and before
      the expiration of the term, the Barbarian was summoned by the
      angel of death. His ambassadors at Constantinople had asked in
      marriage a Roman princess; but the proposal was decently eluded;
      and the daughter of Alexius, who might herself have been the
      victim, expresses her abhorrence of his unnatural conjunction. 46
      The daughter of the sultan was bestowed on the caliph Moctadi,
      with the imperious condition, that, renouncing the society of his
      wives and concubines, he should forever confine himself to this
      honorable alliance.

      Chapter LVII: The Turks.—Part III.

      The greatness and unity of the Turkish empire expired in the
      person of Malek Shah. His vacant throne was disputed by his
      brother and his four sons; 461 and, after a series of civil wars,
      the treaty which reconciled the surviving candidates confirmed a
      lasting separation in the Persian dynasty, the eldest and
      principal branch of the house of Seljuk. The three younger
      dynasties were those of Kerman, of Syria, and of Roum: the first
      of these commanded an extensive, though obscure, 47 dominion on
      the shores of the Indian Ocean: 48 the second expelled the
      Arabian princes of Aleppo and Damascus; and the third, our
      peculiar care, invaded the Roman provinces of Asia Minor. The
      generous policy of Malek contributed to their elevation: he
      allowed the princes of his blood, even those whom he had
      vanquished in the field, to seek new kingdoms worthy of their
      ambition; nor was he displeased that they should draw away the
      more ardent spirits, who might have disturbed the tranquillity of
      his reign. As the supreme head of his family and nation, the
      great sultan of Persia commanded the obedience and tribute of his
      royal brethren: the thrones of Kerman and Nice, of Aleppo and
      Damascus; the Atabeks, and emirs of Syria and Mesopotamia,
      erected their standards under the shadow of his sceptre: 49 and
      the hordes of Turkmans overspread the plains of the Western Asia.

      After the death of Malek, the bands of union and subordination
      were relaxed and finally dissolved: the indulgence of the house
      of Seljuk invested their slaves with the inheritance of kingdoms;
      and, in the Oriental style, a crowd of princes arose from the
      dust of their feet. 50

      detained in his court, (p. 180.)]

      50 (return) [ This expression is quoted by Petit de la Croix (Vie

      A prince of the royal line, Cutulmish, 501 the son of Izrail, the
      son of Seljuk, had fallen in a battle against Alp Arslan and the
      humane victor had dropped a tear over his grave. His five sons,
      strong in arms, ambitious of power, and eager for revenge,
      unsheathed their cimeters against the son of Alp Arslan. The two
      armies expected the signal when the caliph, forgetful of the
      majesty which secluded him from vulgar eyes, interposed his
      venerable mediation. “Instead of shedding the blood of your
      brethren, your brethren both in descent and faith, unite your
      forces in a holy war against the Greeks, the enemies of God and
      his apostle.” They listened to his voice; the sultan embraced his
      rebellious kinsmen; and the eldest, the valiant Soliman, accepted
      the royal standard, which gave him the free conquest and
      hereditary command of the provinces of the Roman empire, from
      Arzeroum to Constantinople, and the unknown regions of the West.
      51 Accompanied by his four brothers, he passed the Euphrates; the
      Turkish camp was soon seated in the neighborhood of Kutaieh in
      Phrygia; and his flying cavalry laid waste the country as far as
      the Hellespont and the Black Sea. Since the decline of the
      empire, the peninsula of Asia Minor had been exposed to the
      transient, though destructive, inroads of the Persians and
      Saracens; but the fruits of a lasting conquest were reserved for
      the Turkish sultan; and his arms were introduced by the Greeks,
      who aspired to reign on the ruins of their country. Since the
      captivity of Romanus, six years the feeble son of Eudocia had
      trembled under the weight of the Imperial crown, till the
      provinces of the East and West were lost in the same month by a
      double rebellion: of either chief Nicephorus was the common name;
      but the surnames of Bryennius and Botoniates distinguish the
      European and Asiatic candidates. Their reasons, or rather their
      promises, were weighed in the Divan; and, after some hesitation,
      Soliman declared himself in favor of Botoniates, opened a free
      passage to his troops in their march from Antioch to Nice, and
      joined the banner of the Crescent to that of the Cross. After his
      ally had ascended the throne of Constantinople, the sultan was
      hospitably entertained in the suburb of Chrysopolis or Scutari;
      and a body of two thousand Turks was transported into Europe, to
      whose dexterity and courage the new emperor was indebted for the
      defeat and captivity of his rival, Bryennius. But the conquest of
      Europe was dearly purchased by the sacrifice of Asia:
      Constantinople was deprived of the obedience and revenue of the
      provinces beyond the Bosphorus and Hellespont; and the regular
      progress of the Turks, who fortified the passes of the rivers and
      mountains, left not a hope of their retreat or expulsion. Another
      candidate implored the aid of the sultan: Melissenus, in his
      purple robes and red buskins, attended the motions of the Turkish
      camp; and the desponding cities were tempted by the summons of a
      Roman prince, who immediately surrendered them into the hands of
      the Barbarians. These acquisitions were confirmed by a treaty of
      peace with the emperor Alexius: his fear of Robert compelled him
      to seek the friendship of Soliman; and it was not till after the
      sultan’s death that he extended as far as Nicomedia, about sixty
      miles from Constantinople, the eastern boundary of the Roman
      world. Trebizond alone, defended on either side by the sea and
      mountains, preserved at the extremity of the Euxine the ancient
      character of a Greek colony, and the future destiny of a
      Christian empire.

      51 (return) [ On the conquest of Asia Minor, M. De Guignes has
      derived no assistance from the Turkish or Arabian writers, who
      produce a naked list of the Seljukides of Roum. The Greeks are
      unwilling to expose their shame, and we must extort some hints
      from Scylitzes, (p. 860, 863,) Nicephorus Bryennius, (p. 88, 91,
      92, &c., 103, 104,) and Anna Comnena (Alexias, p. 91, 92, &c.,
      163, &c.)]

      Since the first conquests of the caliphs, the establishment of
      the Turks in Anatolia or Asia Minor was the most deplorable loss
      which the church and empire had sustained. By the propagation of
      the Moslem faith, Soliman deserved the name of Gazi, a holy
      champion; and his new kingdoms, of the Romans, or of Roum, was
      added to the tables of Oriental geography. It is described as
      extending from the Euphrates to Constantinople, from the Black
      Sea to the confines of Syria; pregnant with mines of silver and
      iron, of alum and copper, fruitful in corn and wine, and
      productive of cattle and excellent horses. 52 The wealth of
      Lydia, the arts of the Greeks, the splendor of the Augustan age,
      existed only in books and ruins, which were equally obscure in
      the eyes of the Scythian conquerors. Yet, in the present decay,
      Anatolia still contains some wealthy and populous cities; and,
      under the Byzantine empire, they were far more flourishing in
      numbers, size, and opulence. By the choice of the sultan, Nice,
      the metropolis of Bithynia, was preferred for his palace and
      fortress: the seat of the Seljukian dynasty of Roum was planted
      one hundred miles from Constantinople; and the divinity of Christ
      was denied and derided in the same temple in which it had been
      pronounced by the first general synod of the Catholics. The unity
      of God, and the mission of Mahomet, were preached in the moschs;
      the Arabian learning was taught in the schools; the Cadhis judged
      according to the law of the Koran; the Turkish manners and
      language prevailed in the cities; and Turkman camps were
      scattered over the plains and mountains of Anatolia. On the hard
      conditions of tribute and servitude, the Greek Christians might
      enjoy the exercise of their religion; but their most holy
      churches were profaned; their priests and bishops were insulted;
      53 they were compelled to suffer the triumph of the Pagans, and
      the apostasy of their brethren; many thousand children were
      marked by the knife of circumcision; and many thousand captives
      were devoted to the service or the pleasures of their masters. 54
      After the loss of Asia, Antioch still maintained her primitive
      allegiance to Christ and Caesar; but the solitary province was
      separated from all Roman aid, and surrounded on all sides by the
      Mahometan powers. The despair of Philaretus the governor prepared
      the sacrifice of his religion and loyalty, had not his guilt been
      prevented by his son, who hastened to the Nicene palace, and
      offered to deliver this valuable prize into the hands of Soliman.
      The ambitious sultan mounted on horseback, and in twelve nights
      (for he reposed in the day) performed a march of six hundred
      miles. Antioch was oppressed by the speed and secrecy of his
      enterprise; and the dependent cities, as far as Laodicea and the
      confines of Aleppo, 55 obeyed the example of the metropolis. From
      Laodicea to the Thracian Bosphorus, or arm of St. George, the
      conquests and reign of Soliman extended thirty days’ journey in
      length, and in breadth about ten or fifteen, between the rocks of
      Lycia and the Black Sea. 56 The Turkish ignorance of navigation
      protected, for a while, the inglorious safety of the emperor; but
      no sooner had a fleet of two hundred ships been constructed by
      the hands of the captive Greeks, than Alexius trembled behind the
      walls of his capital. His plaintive epistles were dispersed over
      Europe, to excite the compassion of the Latins, and to paint the
      danger, the weakness, and the riches of the city of Constantine.

      But the most interesting conquest of the Seljukian Turks was that
      of Jerusalem, 58 which soon became the theatre of nations. In
      their capitulation with Omar, the inhabitants had stipulated the
      assurance of their religion and property; but the articles were
      interpreted by a master against whom it was dangerous to dispute;
      and in the four hundred years of the reign of the caliphs, the
      political climate of Jerusalem was exposed to the vicissitudes of
      storm and sunshine. 59 By the increase of proselytes and
      population, the Mahometans might excuse the usurpation of three
      fourths of the city: but a peculiar quarter was resolved for the
      patriarch with his clergy and people; a tribute of two pieces of
      gold was the price of protection; and the sepulchre of Christ,
      with the church of the Resurrection, was still left in the hands
      of his votaries. Of these votaries, the most numerous and
      respectable portion were strangers to Jerusalem: the pilgrimages
      to the Holy Land had been stimulated, rather than suppressed, by
      the conquest of the Arabs; and the enthusiasm which had always
      prompted these perilous journeys, was nourished by the congenial
      passions of grief and indignation. A crowd of pilgrims from the
      East and West continued to visit the holy sepulchre, and the
      adjacent sanctuaries, more especially at the festival of Easter;
      and the Greeks and Latins, the Nestorians and Jacobites, the
      Copts and Abyssinians, the Armenians and Georgians, maintained
      the chapels, the clergy, and the poor of their respective
      communions. The harmony of prayer in so many various tongues, the
      worship of so many nations in the common temple of their
      religion, might have afforded a spectacle of edification and
      peace; but the zeal of the Christian sects was imbittered by
      hatred and revenge; and in the kingdom of a suffering Messiah,
      who had pardoned his enemies, they aspired to command and
      persecute their spiritual brethren. The preeminence was asserted
      by the spirit and numbers of the Franks; and the greatness of
      Charlemagne 60 protected both the Latin pilgrims and the
      Catholics of the East. The poverty of Carthage, Alexandria, and
      Jerusalem, was relieved by the alms of that pious emperor; and
      many monasteries of Palestine were founded or restored by his
      liberal devotion. Harun Alrashid, the greatest of the Abbassides,
      esteemed in his Christian brother a similar supremacy of genius
      and power: their friendship was cemented by a frequent
      intercourse of gifts and embassies; and the caliph, without
      resigning the substantial dominion, presented the emperor with
      the keys of the holy sepulchre, and perhaps of the city of
      Jerusalem. In the decline of the Carlovingian monarchy, the
      republic of Amalphi promoted the interest of trade and religion
      in the East. Her vessels transported the Latin pilgrims to the
      coasts of Egypt and Palestine, and deserved, by their useful
      imports, the favor and alliance of the Fatimite caliphs: 61 an
      annual fair was instituted on Mount Calvary: and the Italian
      merchants founded the convent and hospital of St. John of
      Jerusalem, the cradle of the monastic and military order, which
      has since reigned in the isles of Rhodes and of Malta. Had the
      Christian pilgrims been content to revere the tomb of a prophet,
      the disciples of Mahomet, instead of blaming, would have
      imitated, their piety: but these rigid Unitarians were
      scandalized by a worship which represents the birth, death, and
      resurrection, of a God; the Catholic images were branded with the
      name of idols; and the Moslems smiled with indignation 62 at the
      miraculous flame which was kindled on the eve of Easter in the
      holy sepulchre. 63 This pious fraud, first devised in the ninth
      century, 64 was devoutly cherished by the Latin crusaders, and is
      annually repeated by the clergy of the Greek, Armenian, and
      Coptic sects, 65 who impose on the credulous spectators 66 for
      their own benefit, and that of their tyrants. In every age, a
      principle of toleration has been fortified by a sense of
      interest: and the revenue of the prince and his emir was
      increased each year, by the expense and tribute of so many
      thousand strangers.

      The revolution which transferred the sceptre from the Abbassides
      to the Fatimites was a benefit, rather than an injury, to the
      Holy Land. A sovereign resident in Egypt was more sensible of the
      importance of Christian trade; and the emirs of Palestine were
      less remote from the justice and power of the throne. But the
      third of these Fatimite caliphs was the famous Hakem, 67 a
      frantic youth, who was delivered by his impiety and despotism
      from the fear either of God or man; and whose reign was a wild
      mixture of vice and folly. Regardless of the most ancient customs
      of Egypt, he imposed on the women an absolute confinement; the
      restraint excited the clamors of both sexes; their clamors
      provoked his fury; a part of Old Cairo was delivered to the
      flames and the guards and citizens were engaged many days in a
      bloody conflict. At first the caliph declared himself a zealous
      Mussulman, the founder or benefactor of moschs and colleges:
      twelve hundred and ninety copies of the Koran were transcribed at
      his expense in letters of gold; and his edict extirpated the
      vineyards of the Upper Egypt. But his vanity was soon flattered
      by the hope of introducing a new religion; he aspired above the
      fame of a prophet, and styled himself the visible image of the
      Most High God, who, after nine apparitions on earth, was at
      length manifest in his royal person. At the name of Hakem, the
      lord of the living and the dead, every knee was bent in religious
      adoration: his mysteries were performed on a mountain near Cairo:
      sixteen thousand converts had signed his profession of faith; and
      at the present hour, a free and warlike people, the Druses of
      Mount Libanus, are persuaded of the life and divinity of a madman
      and tyrant. 68 In his divine character, Hakem hated the Jews and
      Christians, as the servants of his rivals; while some remains of
      prejudice or prudence still pleaded in favor of the law of
      Mahomet. Both in Egypt and Palestine, his cruel and wanton
      persecution made some martyrs and many apostles: the common
      rights and special privileges of the sectaries were equally
      disregarded; and a general interdict was laid on the devotion of
      strangers and natives. The temple of the Christian world, the
      church of the Resurrection, was demolished to its foundations;
      the luminous prodigy of Easter was interrupted, and much profane
      labor was exhausted to destroy the cave in the rock which
      properly constitutes the holy sepulchre. At the report of this
      sacrilege, the nations of Europe were astonished and afflicted:
      but instead of arming in the defence of the Holy Land, they
      contented themselves with burning, or banishing, the Jews, as the
      secret advisers of the impious Barbarian. 69 Yet the calamities
      of Jerusalem were in some measure alleviated by the inconstancy
      or repentance of Hakem himself; and the royal mandate was sealed
      for the restitution of the churches, when the tyrant was
      assassinated by the emissaries of his sister. The succeeding
      caliphs resumed the maxims of religion and policy: a free
      toleration was again granted; with the pious aid of the emperor
      of Constantinople, the holy sepulchre arose from its ruins; and,
      after a short abstinence, the pilgrims returned with an increase
      of appetite to the spiritual feast. 70 In the sea-voyage of
      Palestine, the dangers were frequent, and the opportunities rare:
      but the conversion of Hungary opened a safe communication between
      Germany and Greece. The charity of St. Stephen, the apostle of
      his kingdom, relieved and conducted his itinerant brethren; 71
      and from Belgrade to Antioch, they traversed fifteen hundred
      miles of a Christian empire. Among the Franks, the zeal of
      pilgrimage prevailed beyond the example of former times: and the
      roads were covered with multitudes of either sex, and of every
      rank, who professed their contempt of life, so soon as they
      should have kissed the tomb of their Redeemer. Princes and
      prelates abandoned the care of their dominions; and the numbers
      of these pious caravans were a prelude to the armies which
      marched in the ensuing age under the banner of the cross. About
      thirty years before the first crusade, the arch bishop of Mentz,
      with the bishops of Utrecht, Bamberg, and Ratisbon, undertook
      this laborious journey from the Rhine to the Jordan; and the
      multitude of their followers amounted to seven thousand persons.
      At Constantinople, they were hospitably entertained by the
      emperor; but the ostentation of their wealth provoked the assault
      of the wild Arabs: they drew their swords with scrupulous
      reluctance, and sustained siege in the village of Capernaum, till
      they were rescued by the venal protection of the Fatimite emir.
      After visiting the holy places, they embarked for Italy, but only
      a remnant of two thousand arrived in safety in their native land.

      Ingulphus, a secretary of William the Conqueror, was a companion
      of this pilgrimage: he observes that they sailed from Normandy,
      thirty stout and well-appointed horsemen; but that they repassed
      the Alps, twenty miserable palmers, with the staff in their hand,
      and the wallet at their back. 72

      68 (return) [ The religion of the Druses is concealed by their

      the elect who profess a contemplative life; and the vulgar
      Druses, the most indifferent of men, occasionally conform to the
      worship of the Mahometans and Christians of their neighborhood.
      The little that is, or deserves to be, known, may be seen in the
      industrious Niebuhr, (Voyages, tom. ii. p. 354-357,) and the
      second volume of the recent and instructive Travels of M. de
      Volney. * Note: The religion of the Druses has, within the
      present year, been fully developed from their own writings, which
      have long lain neglected in the libraries of Paris and Oxford, in
      the “Expose de la Religion des Druses, by M. Silvestre de Sacy.”
      Deux tomes, Paris, 1838. The learned author has prefixed a life
      of Hakem Biamr-Allah, which enables us to correct several errors
      in the account of Gibbon. These errors chiefly arose from his
      want of knowledge or of attention to the chronology of Hakem’s
      life. Hakem succeeded to the throne of Egypt in the year of the
      Hegira 386. He did not assume his divinity till 408. His life was
      indeed “a wild mixture of vice and folly,” to which may be added,
      of the most sanguinary cruelty. During his reign, 18,000 persons
      were victims of his ferocity. Yet such is the god, observes M. de
      Sacy, whom the Druses have worshipped for 800 years! (See p.
      ccccxxix.) All his wildest and most extravagant actions were
      interpreted by his followers as having a mystic and allegoric
      meaning, alluding to the destruction of other religions and the
      propagation of his own. It does not seem to have been the
      “vanity” of Hakem which induced him to introduce a new religion.
      The curious point in the new faith is that Hamza, the son of Ali,
      the real founder of the Unitarian religion, (such is its boastful
      title,) was content to take a secondary part. While Hakem was
      God, the one Supreme, the Imam Hamza was his Intelligence. It was
      not in his “divine character” that Hakem “hated the Jews and
      Christians,” but in that of a Mahometan bigot, which he displayed
      in the earlier years of his reign. His barbarous persecution, and
      the burning of the church of the Resurrection at Jerusalem,
      belong entirely to that period; and his assumption of divinity
      was followed by an edict of toleration to Jews and Christians.
      The Mahometans, whose religion he then treated with hostility and
      contempt, being far the most numerous, were his most dangerous
      enemies, and therefore the objects of his most inveterate hatred.
      It is another singular fact, that the religion of Hakem was by no
      means confined to Egypt and Syria. M. de Sacy quotes a letter
      addressed to the chief of the sect in India; and there is
      likewise a letter to the Byzantine emperor Constantine, son of
      Armanous, (Romanus,) and the clergy of the empire. (Constantine
      VIII., M. de Sacy supposes, but this is irreconcilable with
      chronology; it must mean Constantine XI., Monomachus.) The
      assassination of Hakem is, of course, disbelieved by his
      sectaries. M. de Sacy seems to consider the fact obscure and
      doubtful. According to his followers he disappeared, but is
      hereafter to return. At his return the resurrection is to take
      place; the triumph of Unitarianism, and the final discomfiture of
      all other religions. The temple of Mecca is especially devoted to
      destruction. It is remarkable that one of the signs of this final
      consummation, and of the reappearance of Hakem, is that
      Christianity shall be gaining a manifest predominance over
      Mahometanism. As for the religion of the Druses, I cannot agree
      with Gibbon that it does not “deserve” to be better known; and am
      grateful to M. de Sacy, notwithstanding the prolixity and
      occasional repetition in his two large volumes, for the full
      examination of the most extraordinary religious aberration which
      ever extensively affected the mind of man. The worship of a mad
      tyrant is the basis of a subtle metaphysical creed, and of a
      severe, and even ascetic, morality.—M.]

      of a powerful army, and reduced Damascus by famine and the sword.
      Hems, and the other cities of the province, acknowledged the
      caliph of Bagdad and the sultan of Persia; and the victorious
      emir advanced without resistance to the banks of the Nile: the
      Fatimite was preparing to fly into the heart of Africa; but the
      negroes of his guard and the inhabitants of Cairo made a
      desperate sally, and repulsed the Turk from the confines of
      Egypt. In his retreat he indulged the license of slaughter and
      rapine: the judge and notaries of Jerusalem were invited to his
      camp; and their execution was followed by the massacre of three
      thousand citizens. The cruelty or the defeat of Atsiz was soon
      punished by the sultan Toucush, the brother of Malek Shah, who,
      with a higher title and more formidable powers, asserted the
      dominion of Syria and Palestine. The house of Seljuk reigned
      about twenty years in Jerusalem; 74 but the hereditary command of
      the holy city and territory was intrusted or abandoned to the
      emir Ortok, the chief of a tribe of Turkmans, whose children,
      after their expulsion from Palestine, formed two dynasties on the
      borders of Armenia and Assyria. 75 The Oriental Christians and
      the Latin pilgrims deplored a revolution, which, instead of the
      regular government and old alliance of the caliphs, imposed on
      their necks the iron yoke of the strangers of the North. 76 In
      his court and camp the great sultan had adopted in some degree
      the arts and manners of Persia; but the body of the Turkish
      nation, and more especially the pastoral tribes, still breathed
      the fierceness of the desert. From Nice to Jerusalem, the western
      countries of Asia were a scene of foreign and domestic hostility;
      and the shepherds of Palestine, who held a precarious sway on a
      doubtful frontier, had neither leisure nor capacity to await the
      slow profits of commercial and religious freedom. The pilgrims,
      who, through innumerable perils, had reached the gates of
      Jerusalem, were the victims of private rapine or public
      oppression, and often sunk under the pressure of famine and
      disease, before they were permitted to salute the holy sepulchre.
      A spirit of native barbarism, or recent zeal, prompted the
      Turkmans to insult the clergy of every sect: the patriarch was
      dragged by the hair along the pavement, and cast into a dungeon,
      to extort a ransom from the sympathy of his flock; and the divine
      worship in the church of the Resurrection was often disturbed by
      the savage rudeness of its masters. The pathetic tale excited the
      millions of the West to march under the standard of the cross to
      the relief of the Holy Land; and yet how trifling is the sum of
      these accumulated evils, if compared with the single act of the
      sacrilege of Hakem, which had been so patiently endured by the
      Latin Christians! A slighter provocation inflamed the more
      irascible temper of their descendants: a new spirit had arisen of
      religious chivalry and papal dominion; a nerve was touched of
      exquisite feeling; and the sensation vibrated to the heart of
      Europe.

      city was reduced by a Carizmian general to the obedience of the
      caliph of Bagdad, A. H. 463, A.D. 1070. These early dates are not
      very compatible with the general history of Asia; and I am sure,
      that as late as A.D. 1064, the regnum Babylonicum (of Cairo)
      still prevailed in Palestine, (Baronius, A.D. 1064, No. 56.)]
