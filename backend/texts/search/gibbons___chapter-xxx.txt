      If the subjects of Rome could be ignorant of their obligations to
      the great Theodosius, they were too soon convinced, how painfully
      the spirit and abilities of their deceased emperor had supported
      the frail and mouldering edifice of the republic. He died in the
      month of January; and before the end of the winter of the same
      year, the Gothic nation was in arms. 1 The Barbarian auxiliaries
      erected their independent standard; and boldly avowed the hostile
      designs, which they had long cherished in their ferocious minds.
      Their countrymen, who had been condemned, by the conditions of
      the last treaty, to a life of tranquility and labor, deserted
      their farms at the first sound of the trumpet; and eagerly
      resumed the weapons which they had reluctantly laid down. The
      barriers of the Danube were thrown open; the savage warriors of
      Scythia issued from their forests; and the uncommon severity of
      the winter allowed the poet to remark, “that they rolled their
      ponderous wagons over the broad and icy back of the indignant
      river.” 2 The unhappy natives of the provinces to the south of
      the Danube submitted to the calamities, which, in the course of
      twenty years, were almost grown familiar to their imagination;
      and the various troops of Barbarians, who gloried in the Gothic
      name, were irregularly spread from woody shores of Dalmatia, to
      the walls of Constantinople. 3 The interruption, or at least the
      diminution, of the subsidy, which the Goths had received from the
      prudent liberality of Theodosius, was the specious pretence of
      their revolt: the affront was imbittered by their contempt for
      the unwarlike sons of Theodosius; and their resentment was
      inflamed by the weakness, or treachery, of the minister of
      Arcadius. The frequent visits of Rufinus to the camp of the
      Barbarians whose arms and apparel he affected to imitate, were
      considered as a sufficient evidence of his guilty correspondence,
      and the public enemy, from a motive either of gratitude or of
      policy, was attentive, amidst the general devastation, to spare
      the private estates of the unpopular præfect. The Goths, instead
      of being impelled by the blind and headstrong passions of their
      chiefs, were now directed by the bold and artful genius of
      Alaric. That renowned leader was descended from the noble race of
      the Balti; 4 which yielded only to the royal dignity of the
      Amali: he had solicited the command of the Roman armies; and the
      Imperial court provoked him to demonstrate the folly of their
      refusal, and the importance of their loss. Whatever hopes might
      be entertained of the conquest of Constantinople, the judicious
      general soon abandoned an impracticable enterprise. In the midst
      of a divided court and a discontented people, the emperor
      Arcadius was terrified by the aspect of the Gothic arms; but the
      want of wisdom and valor was supplied by the strength of the
      city; and the fortifications, both of the sea and land, might
      securely brave the impotent and random darts of the Barbarians.
      Alaric disdained to trample any longer on the prostrate and
      ruined countries of Thrace and Dacia, and he resolved to seek a
      plentiful harvest of fame and riches in a province which had
      hitherto escaped the ravages of war. 5

      1 (return) [ The revolt of the Goths, and the blockade of
      Constantinople, are distinctly mentioned by Claudian, (in Rufin.
      l. ii. 7-100,) Zosimus, (l. v. 292,) and Jornandes, (de Rebus
      Geticis, c. 29.)]

     Alii per toga ferocis Danubii solidata ruunt; expertaque remis
     Frangunt stagna rotis.

      Claudian and Ovid often amuse their fancy by interchanging the
      metaphors and properties of liquid water, and solid ice. Much
      false wit has been expended in this easy exercise.]

      friend Heliodorus, bishop of Altinum, for the loss of his nephew,

      private misfortunes of the times. See Tillemont, Mem. Eccles.
      tom. xii. p. 200, &c.]

      4 (return) [ Baltha or bold: origo mirifica, says Jornandes, (c.
      29.) This illustrious race long continued to flourish in France,
      in the Gothic province of Septimania, or Languedoc; under the
      corrupted appellation of Boax; and a branch of that family
      afterwards settled in the kingdom of Naples (Grotius in Prolegom.
      ad Hist. Gothic. p. 53.) The lords of Baux, near Arles, and of
      seventy-nine subordinate places, were independent of the counts
      of Provence, (Longuerue, Description de la France, tom. i. p.
      357).]

      5 (return) [ Zosimus (l. v. p. 293-295) is our best guide for the
      conquest of Greece: but the hints and allusion of Claudian are so
      many rays of historic light.]

      The character of the civil and military officers, on whom Rufinus
      had devolved the government of Greece, confirmed the public
      suspicion, that he had betrayed the ancient seat of freedom and
      learning to the Gothic invader. The proconsul Antiochus was the
      unworthy son of a respectable father; and Gerontius, who
      commanded the provincial troops, was much better qualified to
      execute the oppressive orders of a tyrant, than to defend, with
      courage and ability, a country most remarkably fortified by the
      hand of nature. Alaric had traversed, without resistance, the
      plains of Macedonia and Thessaly, as far as the foot of Mount
      Oeta, a steep and woody range of hills, almost impervious to his
      cavalry. They stretched from east to west, to the edge of the
      sea-shore; and left, between the precipice and the Malian Gulf,
      an interval of three hundred feet, which, in some places, was
      contracted to a road capable of admitting only a single carriage.
      6 In this narrow pass of Thermopylae, where Leonidas and the
      three hundred Spartans had gloriously devoted their lives, the
      Goths might have been stopped, or destroyed, by a skilful
      general; and perhaps the view of that sacred spot might have
      kindled some sparks of military ardor in the breasts of the
      degenerate Greeks. The troops which had been posted to defend the
      Straits of Thermopylae, retired, as they were directed, without
      attempting to disturb the secure and rapid passage of Alaric; 7
      and the fertile fields of Phocis and Boeotia were instantly
      covered by a deluge of Barbarians who massacred the males of an
      age to bear arms, and drove away the beautiful females, with the
      spoil and cattle of the flaming villages. The travellers, who
      visited Greece several years afterwards, could easily discover
      the deep and bloody traces of the march of the Goths; and Thebes
      was less indebted for her preservation to the strength of her
      seven gates, than to the eager haste of Alaric, who advanced to
      occupy the city of Athens, and the important harbor of the
      Piraeus. The same impatience urged him to prevent the delay and
      danger of a siege, by the offer of a capitulation; and as soon as
      the Athenians heard the voice of the Gothic herald, they were
      easily persuaded to deliver the greatest part of their wealth, as
      the ransom of the city of Minerva and its inhabitants. The treaty
      was ratified by solemn oaths, and observed with mutual fidelity.
      The Gothic prince, with a small and select train, was admitted
      within the walls; he indulged himself in the refreshment of the
      bath, accepted a splendid banquet, which was provided by the
      magistrate, and affected to show that he was not ignorant of the
      manners of civilized nations. 8 But the whole territory of
      Attica, from the promontory of Sunium to the town of Megara, was
      blasted by his baleful presence; and, if we may use the
      comparison of a contemporary philosopher, Athens itself resembled
      the bleeding and empty skin of a slaughtered victim. The distance
      between Megara and Corinth could not much exceed thirty miles;
      but the bad road, an expressive name, which it still bears among
      the Greeks, was, or might easily have been made, impassable for
      the march of an enemy. The thick and gloomy woods of Mount
      Cithaeron covered the inland country; the Scironian rocks
      approached the water’s edge, and hung over the narrow and winding
      path, which was confined above six miles along the sea-shore. 9
      The passage of those rocks, so infamous in every age, was
      terminated by the Isthmus of Corinth; and a small a body of firm
      and intrepid soldiers might have successfully defended a
      temporary intrenchment of five or six miles from the Ionian to
      the Aegean Sea. The confidence of the cities of Peloponnesus in
      their natural rampart, had tempted them to neglect the care of
      their antique walls; and the avarice of the Roman governors had
      exhausted and betrayed the unhappy province. 10 Corinth, Argos,
      Sparta, yielded without resistance to the arms of the Goths; and
      the most fortunate of the inhabitants were saved, by death, from
      beholding the slavery of their families and the conflagration of
      their cities. 11 The vases and statues were distributed among the
      Barbarians, with more regard to the value of the materials, than
      to the elegance of the workmanship; the female captives submitted
      to the laws of war; the enjoyment of beauty was the reward of
      valor; and the Greeks could not reasonably complain of an abuse
      which was justified by the example of the heroic times. 12 The
      descendants of that extraordinary people, who had considered
      valor and discipline as the walls of Sparta, no longer remembered
      the generous reply of their ancestors to an invader more
      formidable than Alaric. “If thou art a god, thou wilt not hurt
      those who have never injured thee; if thou art a man,
      advance:—and thou wilt find men equal to thyself.” 13 From
      Thermopylae to Sparta, the leader of the Goths pursued his
      victorious march without encountering any mortal antagonists: but
      one of the advocates of expiring Paganism has confidently
      asserted, that the walls of Athens were guarded by the goddess
      Minerva, with her formidable Aegis, and by the angry phantom of
      Achilles; 14 and that the conqueror was dismayed by the presence
      of the hostile deities of Greece. In an age of miracles, it would
      perhaps be unjust to dispute the claim of the historian Zosimus
      to the common benefit: yet it cannot be dissembled, that the mind
      of Alaric was ill prepared to receive, either in sleeping or
      waking visions, the impressions of Greek superstition. The songs
      of Homer, and the fame of Achilles, had probably never reached
      the ear of the illiterate Barbarian; and the Christian faith,
      which he had devoutly embraced, taught him to despise the
      imaginary deities of Rome and Athens. The invasion of the Goths,
      instead of vindicating the honor, contributed, at least
      accidentally, to extirpate the last remains of Paganism: and the
      mysteries of Ceres, which had subsisted eighteen hundred years,
      did not survive the destruction of Eleusis, and the calamities of
      Greece. 15

      6 (return) [ Compare Herodotus (l. vii. c. 176) and Livy, (xxxvi.
      15.) The narrow entrance of Greece was probably enlarged by each
      successive ravisher.]

      edit. Commelin, 1596,) through the straits, of Thermopylae.]

      8 (return) [ In obedience to Jerom and Claudian, (in Rufin. l.
      ii. 191,) I have mixed some darker colors in the mild
      representation of Zosimus, who wished to soften the calamities of
      Athens.

     Nec fera Cecropias traxissent vincula matres.

      Synesius (Epist. clvi. p. 272, edit. Petav.) observes, that
      Athens, whose sufferings he imputes to the proconsul’s avarice,
      was at that time less famous for her schools of philosophy than
      for her trade of honey.]

      of rapine and destruction.]

      11 (return) [ These generous lines of Homer (Odyss. l. v. 306)
      were transcribed by one of the captive youths of Corinth: and the
      tears of Mummius may prove that the rude conqueror, though he was
      ignorant of the value of an original picture, possessed the
      purest source of good taste, a benevolent heart, (Plutarch,
      Symposiac. l. ix. tom. ii. p. 737, edit. Wechel.)]

      12 (return) [ Homer perpetually describes the exemplary patience
      of those female captives, who gave their charms, and even their
      hearts, to the murderers of their fathers, brothers, &c. Such a
      passion (of Eriphile for Achilles) is touched with admirable
      delicacy by Racine.]

      13 (return) [ Plutarch (in Pyrrho, tom. ii. p. 474, edit. Brian)
      gives the genuine answer in the Laconic dialect. Pyrrhus attacked
      Sparta with 25,000 foot, 2000 horse, and 24 elephants, and the
      defence of that open town is a fine comment on the laws of
      Lycurgus, even in the last stage of decay.]

      nobly painted him.]

      that a troop of monks betrayed Greece, and followed the Gothic
      camp. * Note: The expression is curious: Vit. Max. t. i. p. 53,
      edit. Boissonade.—M.]

      The last hope of a people who could no longer depend on their
      arms, their gods, or their sovereign, was placed in the powerful
      assistance of the general of the West; and Stilicho, who had not
      been permitted to repulse, advanced to chastise, the invaders of
      Greece. 16 A numerous fleet was equipped in the ports of Italy;
      and the troops, after a short and prosperous navigation over the
      Ionian Sea, were safely disembarked on the isthmus, near the
      ruins of Corinth. The woody and mountainous country of Arcadia,
      the fabulous residence of Pan and the Dryads, became the scene of
      a long and doubtful conflict between the two generals not
      unworthy of each other. The skill and perseverance of the Roman
      at length prevailed; and the Goths, after sustaining a
      considerable loss from disease and desertion, gradually retreated
      to the lofty mountain of Pholoe, near the sources of the Peneus,
      and on the frontiers of Elis; a sacred country, which had
      formerly been exempted from the calamities of war. 17 The camp of
      the Barbarians was immediately besieged; the waters of the river
      18 were diverted into another channel; and while they labored
      under the intolerable pressure of thirst and hunger, a strong
      line of circumvallation was formed to prevent their escape. After
      these precautions, Stilicho, too confident of victory, retired to
      enjoy his triumph, in the theatrical games, and lascivious
      dances, of the Greeks; his soldiers, deserting their standards,
      spread themselves over the country of their allies, which they
      stripped of all that had been saved from the rapacious hands of
      the enemy. Alaric appears to have seized the favorable moment to
      execute one of those hardy enterprises, in which the abilities of
      a general are displayed with more genuine lustre, than in the
      tumult of a day of battle. To extricate himself from the prison
      of Peloponnesus, it was necessary that he should pierce the
      intrenchments which surrounded his camp; that he should perform a
      difficult and dangerous march of thirty miles, as far as the Gulf
      of Corinth; and that he should transport his troops, his
      captives, and his spoil, over an arm of the sea, which, in the
      narrow interval between Rhium and the opposite shore, is at least
      half a mile in breadth. 19 The operations of Alaric must have
      been secret, prudent, and rapid; since the Roman general was
      confounded by the intelligence, that the Goths, who had eluded
      his efforts, were in full possession of the important province of
      Epirus. This unfortunate delay allowed Alaric sufficient time to
      conclude the treaty, which he secretly negotiated, with the
      ministers of Constantinople. The apprehension of a civil war
      compelled Stilicho to retire, at the haughty mandate of his
      rivals, from the dominions of Arcadius; and he respected, in the
      enemy of Rome, the honorable character of the ally and servant of
      the emperor of the East.

      16 (return) [ For Stilicho’s Greek war, compare the honest
      narrative of Zosimus (l. v. p. 295, 296) with the curious
      circumstantial flattery of Claudian, (i. Cons. Stilich. l. i.
      172-186, iv. Cons. Hon. 459-487.) As the event was not glorious,
      it is artfully thrown into the shade.]

      17 (return) [ The troops who marched through Elis delivered up
      their arms. This security enriched the Eleans, who were lovers of
      a rural life. Riches begat pride: they disdained their privilege,
      and they suffered. Polybius advises them to retire once more
      within their magic circle. See a learned and judicious discourse
      on the Olympic games, which Mr. West has prefixed to his
      translation of Pindar.]

      18 (return) [ Claudian (in iv. Cons. Hon. 480) alludes to the
      fact without naming the river; perhaps the Alpheus, (i. Cons.
      Stil. l. i. 185.)

   —-Et Alpheus Geticis angustus acervis Tardior ad Siculos etiamnum
   pergit amores.

      Yet I should prefer the Peneus, a shallow stream in a wide and
      deep bed, which runs through Elis, and falls into the sea below
      Cyllene. It had been joined with the Alpheus to cleanse the
      Augean stable. (Cellarius, tom. i. p. 760. Chandler’s Travels, p.
      286.)]

      points the distance between the two lands.]

      A Grecian philosopher, 20 who visited Constantinople soon after
      the death of Theodosius, published his liberal opinions
      concerning the duties of kings, and the state of the Roman
      republic. Synesius observes, and deplores, the fatal abuse, which
      the imprudent bounty of the late emperor had introduced into the
      military service. The citizens and subjects had purchased an
      exemption from the indispensable duty of defending their country;
      which was supported by the arms of Barbarian mercenaries. The
      fugitives of Scythia were permitted to disgrace the illustrious
      dignities of the empire; their ferocious youth, who disdained the
      salutary restraint of laws, were more anxious to acquire the
      riches, than to imitate the arts, of a people, the object of
      their contempt and hatred; and the power of the Goths was the
      stone of Tantalus, perpetually suspended over the peace and
      safety of the devoted state. The measures which Synesius
      recommends, are the dictates of a bold and generous patriot. He
      exhorts the emperor to revive the courage of his subjects, by the
      example of manly virtue; to banish luxury from the court and from
      the camp; to substitute, in the place of the Barbarian
      mercenaries, an army of men, interested in the defence of their
      laws and of their property; to force, in such a moment of public
      danger, the mechanic from his shop, and the philosopher from his
      school; to rouse the indolent citizen from his dream of pleasure,
      and to arm, for the protection of agriculture, the hands of the
      laborious husbandman. At the head of such troops, who might
      deserve the name, and would display the spirit, of Romans, he
      animates the son of Theodosius to encounter a race of Barbarians,
      who were destitute of any real courage; and never to lay down his
      arms, till he had chased them far away into the solitudes of
      Scythia; or had reduced them to the state of ignominious
      servitude, which the Lacedaemonians formerly imposed on the
      captive Helots. 21 The court of Arcadius indulged the zeal,
      applauded the eloquence, and neglected the advice, of Synesius.
      Perhaps the philosopher who addresses the emperor of the East in
      the language of reason and virtue, which he might have used to a
      Spartan king, had not condescended to form a practicable scheme,
      consistent with the temper, and circumstances, of a degenerate
      age. Perhaps the pride of the ministers, whose business was
      seldom interrupted by reflection, might reject, as wild and
      visionary, every proposal, which exceeded the measure of their
      capacity, and deviated from the forms and precedents of office.
      While the oration of Synesius, and the downfall of the
      Barbarians, were the topics of popular conversation, an edict was
      published at Constantinople, which declared the promotion of
      Alaric to the rank of master-general of the Eastern Illyricum.
      The Roman provincials, and the allies, who had respected the
      faith of treaties, were justly indignant, that the ruin of Greece
      and Epirus should be so liberally rewarded. The Gothic conqueror
      was received as a lawful magistrate, in the cities which he had
      so lately besieged. The fathers, whose sons he had massacred, the
      husbands, whose wives he had violated, were subject to his
      authority; and the success of his rebellion encouraged the
      ambition of every leader of the foreign mercenaries. The use to
      which Alaric applied his new command, distinguishes the firm and
      judicious character of his policy. He issued his orders to the
      four magazines and manufactures of offensive and defensive arms,
      Margus, Ratiaria, Naissus, and Thessalonica, to provide his
      troops with an extraordinary supply of shields, helmets, swords,
      and spears; the unhappy provincials were compelled to forge the
      instruments of their own destruction; and the Barbarians removed
      the only defect which had sometimes disappointed the efforts of
      their courage. 22 The birth of Alaric, the glory of his past
      exploits, and the confidence in his future designs, insensibly
      united the body of the nation under his victorious standard; and,
      with the unanimous consent of the Barbarian chieftains, the
      master-general of Illyricum was elevated, according to ancient
      custom, on a shield, and solemnly proclaimed king of the
      Visigoths. 23 Armed with this double power, seated on the verge
      of the two empires, he alternately sold his deceitful promises to
      the courts of Arcadius and Honorius; till he declared and
      executed his resolution of invading the dominions of the West.
      The provinces of Europe which belonged to the Eastern emperor,
      were already exhausted; those of Asia were inaccessible; and the
      strength of Constantinople had resisted his attack. But he was
      tempted by the fame, the beauty, the wealth of Italy, which he
      had twice visited; and he secretly aspired to plant the Gothic
      standard on the walls of Rome, and to enrich his army with the
      accumulated spoils of three hundred triumphs. 25

      rashly fixed the interpreters escaped through an ambiguous
      meaning.]

      The scarcity of facts, 26 and the uncertainty of dates, 27 oppose
      our attempts to describe the circumstances of the first invasion
      of Italy by the arms of Alaric. His march, perhaps from
      Thessalonica, through the warlike and hostile country of
      Pannonia, as far as the foot of the Julian Alps; his passage of
      those mountains, which were strongly guarded by troops and
      intrenchments; the siege of Aquileia, and the conquest of the
      provinces of Istria and Venetia, appear to have employed a
      considerable time. Unless his operations were extremely cautious
      and slow, the length of the interval would suggest a probable
      suspicion, that the Gothic king retreated towards the banks of
      the Danube; and reenforced his army with fresh swarms of
      Barbarians, before he again attempted to penetrate into the heart
      of Italy. Since the public and important events escape the
      diligence of the historian, he may amuse himself with
      contemplating, for a moment, the influence of the arms of Alaric
      on the fortunes of two obscure individuals, a presbyter of
      Aquileia and a husbandman of Verona. The learned Rufinus, who was
      summoned by his enemies to appear before a Roman synod, 28 wisely
      preferred the dangers of a besieged city; and the Barbarians, who
      furiously shook the walls of Aquileia, might save him from the
      cruel sentence of another heretic, who, at the request of the
      same bishops, was severely whipped, and condemned to perpetual
      exile on a desert island. 29 The old man, 30 who had passed his
      simple and innocent life in the neighborhood of Verona, was a
      stranger to the quarrels both of kings and of bishops; his
      pleasures, his desires, his knowledge, were confined within the
      little circle of his paternal farm; and a staff supported his
      aged steps, on the same ground where he had sported in his
      infancy. Yet even this humble and rustic felicity (which Claudian
      describes with so much truth and feeling) was still exposed to
      the undistinguishing rage of war. His trees, his old contemporary
      trees, 31 must blaze in the conflagration of the whole country; a
      detachment of Gothic cavalry might sweep away his cottage and his
      family; and the power of Alaric could destroy this happiness,
      which he was not able either to taste or to bestow. “Fame,” says
      the poet, “encircling with terror her gloomy wings, proclaimed
      the march of the Barbarian army, and filled Italy with
      consternation:” the apprehensions of each individual were
      increased in just proportion to the measure of his fortune: and
      the most timid, who had already embarked their valuable effects,
      meditated their escape to the Island of Sicily, or the African
      coast. The public distress was aggravated by the fears and
      reproaches of superstition. 32 Every hour produced some horrid
      tale of strange and portentous accidents; the Pagans deplored the
      neglect of omens, and the interruption of sacrifices; but the
      Christians still derived some comfort from the powerful
      intercession of the saints and martyrs. 33

      Chapter XXX: Revolt Of The Goths.—Part II.

      The emperor Honorius was distinguished, above his subjects, by
      the preeminence of fear, as well as of rank. The pride and luxury
      in which he was educated, had not allowed him to suspect, that
      there existed on the earth any power presumptuous enough to
      invade the repose of the successor of Augustus. The arts of
      flattery concealed the impending danger, till Alaric approached
      the palace of Milan. But when the sound of war had awakened the
      young emperor, instead of flying to arms with the spirit, or even
      the rashness, of his age, he eagerly listened to those timid
      counsellors, who proposed to convey his sacred person, and his
      faithful attendants, to some secure and distant station in the
      provinces of Gaul. Stilicho alone 34 had courage and authority to
      resist his disgraceful measure, which would have abandoned Rome
      and Italy to the Barbarians; but as the troops of the palace had
      been lately detached to the Rhaetian frontier, and as the
      resource of new levies was slow and precarious, the general of
      the West could only promise, that if the court of Milan would
      maintain their ground during his absence, he would soon return
      with an army equal to the encounter of the Gothic king. Without
      losing a moment, (while each moment was so important to the
      public safety,) Stilicho hastily embarked on the Larian Lake,
      ascended the mountains of ice and snow, amidst the severity of an
      Alpine winter, and suddenly repressed, by his unexpected
      presence, the enemy, who had disturbed the tranquillity of
      Rhaetia. 35 The Barbarians, perhaps some tribes of the Alemanni,
      respected the firmness of a chief, who still assumed the language
      of command; and the choice which he condescended to make, of a
      select number of their bravest youth, was considered as a mark of
      his esteem and favor. The cohorts, who were delivered from the
      neighboring foe, diligently repaired to the Imperial standard;
      and Stilicho issued his orders to the most remote troops of the
      West, to advance, by rapid marches, to the defence of Honorius
      and of Italy. The fortresses of the Rhine were abandoned; and the
      safety of Gaul was protected only by the faith of the Germans,
      and the ancient terror of the Roman name. Even the legion, which
      had been stationed to guard the wall of Britain against the
      Caledonians of the North, was hastily recalled; 36 and a numerous
      body of the cavalry of the Alani was persuaded to engage in the
      service of the emperor, who anxiously expected the return of his
      general. The prudence and vigor of Stilicho were conspicuous on
      this occasion, which revealed, at the same time, the weakness of
      the falling empire. The legions of Rome, which had long since
      languished in the gradual decay of discipline and courage, were
      exterminated by the Gothic and civil wars; and it was found
      impossible, without exhausting and exposing the provinces, to
      assemble an army for the defence of Italy.

      34 (return) [ Solus erat Stilicho, &c., is the exclusive
      commendation which Claudian bestows, (del Bell. Get. 267,)

      must Honorius have appeared in his own court.]

      35 (return) [ The face of the country, and the hardiness of
      Stilicho, are finely described, (de Bell. Get. 340-363.)]

      must have required a longer space of time than Claudian seems
      willing to allow for the duration of the Gothic war.]




      Chapter XXX: Revolt Of The Goths.—Part III.

      When Stilicho seemed to abandon his sovereign in the unguarded
      palace of Milan, he had probably calculated the term of his
      absence, the distance of the enemy, and the obstacles that might
      retard their march. He principally depended on the rivers of
      Italy, the Adige, the Mincius, the Oglio, and the Addua, which,
      in the winter or spring, by the fall of rains, or by the melting
      of the snows, are commonly swelled into broad and impetuous
      torrents. 37 But the season happened to be remarkably dry: and
      the Goths could traverse, without impediment, the wide and stony
      beds, whose centre was faintly marked by the course of a shallow
      stream. The bridge and passage of the Addua were secured by a
      strong detachment of the Gothic army; and as Alaric approached
      the walls, or rather the suburbs, of Milan, he enjoyed the proud
      satisfaction of seeing the emperor of the Romans fly before him.
      Honorius, accompanied by a feeble train of statesmen and eunuchs,
      hastily retreated towards the Alps, with a design of securing his
      person in the city of Arles, which had often been the royal
      residence of his predecessors. 3711 But Honorius 38 had scarcely
      passed the Po, before he was overtaken by the speed of the Gothic
      cavalry; 39 since the urgency of the danger compelled him to seek
      a temporary shelter within the fortifications of Asta, a town of
      Liguria or Piemont, situate on the banks of the Tanarus. 40 The
      siege of an obscure place, which contained so rich a prize, and
      seemed incapable of a long resistance, was instantly formed, and
      indefatigably pressed, by the king of the Goths; and the bold
      declaration, which the emperor might afterwards make, that his
      breast had never been susceptible of fear, did not probably
      obtain much credit, even in his own court. 41 In the last, and
      almost hopeless extremity, after the Barbarians had already
      proposed the indignity of a capitulation, the Imperial captive
      was suddenly relieved by the fame, the approach, and at length
      the presence, of the hero, whom he had so long expected. At the
      head of a chosen and intrepid vanguard, Stilicho swam the stream
      of the Addua, to gain the time which he must have lost in the
      attack of the bridge; the passage of the Po was an enterprise of
      much less hazard and difficulty; and the successful action, in
      which he cut his way through the Gothic camp under the walls of
      Asta, revived the hopes, and vindicated the honor, of Rome.
      Instead of grasping the fruit of his victory, the Barbarian was
      gradually invested, on every side, by the troops of the West, who
      successively issued through all the passes of the Alps; his
      quarters were straitened; his convoys were intercepted; and the
      vigilance of the Romans prepared to form a chain of
      fortifications, and to besiege the lines of the besiegers. A
      military council was assembled of the long-haired chiefs of the
      Gothic nation; of aged warriors, whose bodies were wrapped in
      furs, and whose stern countenances were marked with honorable
      wounds. They weighed the glory of persisting in their attempt
      against the advantage of securing their plunder; and they
      recommended the prudent measure of a seasonable retreat. In this
      important debate, Alaric displayed the spirit of the conqueror of
      Rome; and after he had reminded his countrymen of their
      achievements and of their designs, he concluded his animating
      speech by the solemn and positive assurance that he was resolved
      to find in Italy either a kingdom or a grave. 42

      circumstances; and possibly not less genuine than those of Livy.]

      The loose discipline of the Barbarians always exposed them to the
      danger of a surprise; but, instead of choosing the dissolute
      hours of riot and intemperance, Stilicho resolved to attack the
      Christian Goths, whilst they were devoutly employed in
      celebrating the festival of Easter. 43 The execution of the
      stratagem, or, as it was termed by the clergy of the sacrilege,
      was intrusted to Saul, a Barbarian and a Pagan, who had served,
      however, with distinguished reputation among the veteran generals
      of Theodosius. The camp of the Goths, which Alaric had pitched in
      the neighborhood of Pollentia, 44 was thrown into confusion by
      the sudden and impetuous charge of the Imperial cavalry; but, in
      a few moments, the undaunted genius of their leader gave them an
      order, and a field of battle; and, as soon as they had recovered
      from their astonishment, the pious confidence, that the God of
      the Christians would assert their cause, added new strength to
      their native valor. In this engagement, which was long maintained
      with equal courage and success, the chief of the Alani, whose
      diminutive and savage form concealed a magnanimous soul approved
      his suspected loyalty, by the zeal with which he fought, and
      fell, in the service of the republic; and the fame of this
      gallant Barbarian has been imperfectly preserved in the verses of
      Claudian, since the poet, who celebrates his virtue, has omitted
      the mention of his name. His death was followed by the flight and
      dismay of the squadrons which he commanded; and the defeat of the
      wing of cavalry might have decided the victory of Alaric, if
      Stilicho had not immediately led the Roman and Barbarian infantry
      to the attack. The skill of the general, and the bravery of the
      soldiers, surmounted every obstacle. In the evening of the bloody
      day, the Goths retreated from the field of battle; the
      intrenchments of their camp were forced, and the scene of rapine
      and slaughter made some atonement for the calamities which they
      had inflicted on the subjects of the empire. 45 The magnificent
      spoils of Corinth and Argos enriched the veterans of the West;
      the captive wife of Alaric, who had impatiently claimed his
      promise of Roman jewels and Patrician handmaids, 46 was reduced
      to implore the mercy of the insulting foe; and many thousand
      prisoners, released from the Gothic chains, dispersed through the
      provinces of Italy the praises of their heroic deliverer. The
      triumph of Stilicho 47 was compared by the poet, and perhaps by
      the public, to that of Marius; who, in the same part of Italy,
      had encountered and destroyed another army of Northern
      Barbarians. The huge bones, and the empty helmets, of the Cimbri
      and of the Goths, would easily be confounded by succeeding
      generations; and posterity might erect a common trophy to the
      memory of the two most illustrious generals, who had vanquished,
      on the same memorable ground, the two most formidable enemies of
      Rome. 48

      Arian robber. See Tillemont (Hist des Emp. tom. v. p. 529) who

      victory of Pollentia. They are poetical and party writers; yet
      some credit is due to the most suspicious witnesses, who are
      checked by the recent notoriety of facts.]

      48 (return) [ Claudian’s peroration is strong and elegant; but
      the identity of the Cimbric and Gothic fields must be understood
      (like Virgil’s Philippi, Georgic i. 490) according to the loose
      geography of a poet. Verselle and Pollentia are sixty miles from
      each other; and the latitude is still greater, if the Cimbri were
      defeated in the wide and barren plain of Verona, (Maffei, Verona
      Illustrata, P. i. p. 54-62.)]

      The eloquence of Claudian 49 has celebrated, with lavish
      applause, the victory of Pollentia, one of the most glorious days
      in the life of his patron; but his reluctant and partial muse
      bestows more genuine praise on the character of the Gothic king.
      His name is, indeed, branded with the reproachful epithets of
      pirate and robber, to which the conquerors of every age are so
      justly entitled; but the poet of Stilicho is compelled to
      acknowledge that Alaric possessed the invincible temper of mind,
      which rises superior to every misfortune, and derives new
      resources from adversity. After the total defeat of his infantry,
      he escaped, or rather withdrew, from the field of battle, with
      the greatest part of his cavalry entire and unbroken. Without
      wasting a moment to lament the irreparable loss of so many brave
      companions, he left his victorious enemy to bind in chains the
      captive images of a Gothic king; 50 and boldly resolved to break
      through the unguarded passes of the Apennine, to spread
      desolation over the fruitful face of Tuscany, and to conquer or
      die before the gates of Rome. The capital was saved by the active
      and incessant diligence of Stilicho; but he respected the despair
      of his enemy; and, instead of committing the fate of the republic
      to the chance of another battle, he proposed to purchase the
      absence of the Barbarians. The spirit of Alaric would have
      rejected such terms, the permission of a retreat, and the offer
      of a pension, with contempt and indignation; but he exercised a
      limited and precarious authority over the independent chieftains
      who had raised him, for their service, above the rank of his
      equals; they were still less disposed to follow an unsuccessful
      general, and many of them were tempted to consult their interest
      by a private negotiation with the minister of Honorius. The king
      submitted to the voice of his people, ratified the treaty with
      the empire of the West, and repassed the Po with the remains of
      the flourishing army which he had led into Italy. A considerable
      part of the Roman forces still continued to attend his motions;
      and Stilicho, who maintained a secret correspondence with some of
      the Barbarian chiefs, was punctually apprised of the designs that
      were formed in the camp and council of Alaric. The king of the
      Goths, ambitious to signalize his retreat by some splendid
      achievement, had resolved to occupy the important city of Verona,
      which commands the principal passage of the Rhaetian Alps; and,
      directing his march through the territories of those German
      tribes, whose alliance would restore his exhausted strength, to
      invade, on the side of the Rhine, the wealthy and unsuspecting
      provinces of Gaul. Ignorant of the treason which had already
      betrayed his bold and judicious enterprise, he advanced towards
      the passes of the mountains, already possessed by the Imperial
      troops; where he was exposed, almost at the same instant, to a
      general attack in the front, on his flanks, and in the rear. In
      this bloody action, at a small distance from the walls of Verona,
      the loss of the Goths was not less heavy than that which they had
      sustained in the defeat of Pollentia; and their valiant king, who
      escaped by the swiftness of his horse, must either have been
      slain or made prisoner, if the hasty rashness of the Alani had
      not disappointed the measures of the Roman general. Alaric
      secured the remains of his army on the adjacent rocks; and
      prepared himself, with undaunted resolution, to maintain a siege
      against the superior numbers of the enemy, who invested him on
      all sides. But he could not oppose the destructive progress of
      hunger and disease; nor was it possible for him to check the
      continual desertion of his impatient and capricious Barbarians.
      In this extremity he still found resources in his own courage, or
      in the moderation of his adversary; and the retreat of the Gothic
      king was considered as the deliverance of Italy. 51 Yet the
      people, and even the clergy, incapable of forming any rational
      judgment of the business of peace and war, presumed to arraign
      the policy of Stilicho, who so often vanquished, so often
      surrounded, and so often dismissed the implacable enemy of the
      republic. The first momen of the public safety is devoted to
      gratitude and joy; but the second is diligently occupied by envy
      and calumny. 52

      The citizens of Rome had been astonished by the approach of
      Alaric; and the diligence with which they labored to restore the
      walls of the capital, confessed their own fears, and the decline
      of the empire. After the retreat of the Barbarians, Honorius was
      directed to accept the dutiful invitation of the senate, and to
      celebrate, in the Imperial city, the auspicious era of the
      Gothic victory, and of his sixth consulship. 53 The suburbs and
      the streets, from the Milvian bridge to the Palatine mount, were
      filled by the Roman people, who, in the space of a hundred years,
      had only thrice been honored with the presence of their
      sovereigns. While their eyes were fixed on the chariot where
      Stilicho was deservedly seated by the side of his royal pupil,
      they applauded the pomp of a triumph, which was not stained, like
      that of Constantine, or of Theodosius, with civil blood. The
      procession passed under a lofty arch, which had been purposely
      erected: but in less than seven years, the Gothic conquerors of
      Rome might read, if they were able to read, the superb
      inscription of that monument, which attested the total defeat and
      destruction of their nation. 54 The emperor resided several
      months in the capital, and every part of his behavior was
      regulated with care to conciliate the affection of the clergy,
      the senate, and the people of Rome. The clergy was edified by his
      frequent visits and liberal gifts to the shrines of the apostles.
      The senate, who, in the triumphal procession, had been excused
      from the humiliating ceremony of preceding on foot the Imperial
      chariot, was treated with the decent reverence which Stilicho
      always affected for that assembly. The people was repeatedly
      gratified by the attention and courtesy of Honorius in the public
      games, which were celebrated on that occasion with a magnificence
      not unworthy of the spectator. As soon as the appointed number of
      chariot-races was concluded, the decoration of the Circus was
      suddenly changed; the hunting of wild beasts afforded a various
      and splendid entertainment; and the chase was succeeded by a
      military dance, which seems, in the lively description of
      Claudian, to present the image of a modern tournament.

      In these games of Honorius, the inhuman combats of gladiators 55
      polluted, for the last time, the amphitheater of Rome. The first
      Christian emperor may claim the honor of the first edict which
      condemned the art and amusement of shedding human blood; 56 but
      this benevolent law expressed the wishes of the prince, without
      reforming an inveterate abuse, which degraded a civilized nation
      below the condition of savage cannibals. Several hundred, perhaps
      several thousand, victims were annually slaughtered in the great
      cities of the empire; and the month of December, more peculiarly
      devoted to the combats of gladiators, still exhibited to the eyes
      of the Roman people a grateful spectacle of blood and cruelty.
      Amidst the general joy of the victory of Pollentia, a Christian
      poet exhorted the emperor to extirpate, by his authority, the
      horrid custom which had so long resisted the voice of humanity
      and religion. 57 The pathetic representations of Prudentius were
      less effectual than the generous boldness of Telemachus, an
      Asiatic monk, whose death was more useful to mankind than his
      life. 58 The Romans were provoked by the interruption of their
      pleasures; and the rash monk, who had descended into the arena to
      separate the gladiators, was overwhelmed under a shower of
      stones. But the madness of the people soon subsided; they
      respected the memory of Telemachus, who had deserved the honors
      of martyrdom; and they submitted, without a murmur, to the laws
      of Honorius, which abolished forever the human sacrifices of the
      amphitheater. 5811 The citizens, who adhered to the manners of
      their ancestors, might perhaps insinuate that the last remains of
      a martial spirit were preserved in this school of fortitude,
      which accustomed the Romans to the sight of blood, and to the
      contempt of death; a vain and cruel prejudice, so nobly confuted
      by the valor of ancient Greece, and of modern Europe! 59

      The recent danger, to which the person of the emperor had been
      exposed in the defenceless palace of Milan, urged him to seek a
      retreat in some inaccessible fortress of Italy, where he might
      securely remain, while the open country was covered by a deluge
      of Barbarians. On the coast of the Adriatic, about ten or twelve
      miles from the most southern of the seven mouths of the Po, the
      Thessalians had founded the ancient colony of Ravenna, 60 which
      they afterwards resigned to the natives of Umbria. Augustus, who
      had observed the opportunity of the place, prepared, at the
      distance of three miles from the old town, a capacious harbor,
      for the reception of two hundred and fifty ships of war. This
      naval establishment, which included the arsenals and magazines,
      the barracks of the troops, and the houses of the artificers,
      derived its origin and name from the permanent station of the
      Roman fleet; the intermediate space was soon filled with
      buildings and inhabitants, and the three extensive and populous
      quarters of Ravenna gradually contributed to form one of the most
      important cities of Italy. The principal canal of Augustus poured
      a copious stream of the waters of the Po through the midst of the
      city, to the entrance of the harbor; the same waters were
      introduced into the profound ditches that encompassed the walls;
      they were distributed by a thousand subordinate canals, into
      every part of the city, which they divided into a variety of
      small islands; the communication was maintained only by the use
      of boats and bridges; and the houses of Ravenna, whose appearance
      may be compared to that of Venice, were raised on the foundation
      of wooden piles. The adjacent country, to the distance of many
      miles, was a deep and impassable morass; and the artificial
      causeway, which connected Ravenna with the continent, might be
      easily guarded or destroyed, on the approach of a hostile army
      These morasses were interspersed, however, with vineyards: and
      though the soil was exhausted by four or five crops, the town
      enjoyed a more plentiful supply of wine than of fresh water. 61
      The air, instead of receiving the sickly, and almost
      pestilential, exhalations of low and marshy grounds, was
      distinguished, like the neighborhood of Alexandria, as uncommonly
      pure and salubrious; and this singular advantage was ascribed to
      the regular tides of the Adriatic, which swept the canals,
      interrupted the unwholesome stagnation of the waters, and
      floated, every day, the vessels of the adjacent country into the
      heart of Ravenna. The gradual retreat of the sea has left the
      modern city at the distance of four miles from the Adriatic; and
      as early as the fifth or sixth century of the Christian era, the
      port of Augustus was converted into pleasant orchards; and a
      lonely grove of pines covered the ground where the Roman fleet
      once rode at anchor. 62 Even this alteration contributed to
      increase the natural strength of the place, and the shallowness
      of the water was a sufficient barrier against the large ships of
      the enemy. This advantageous situation was fortified by art and
      labor; and in the twentieth year of his age, the emperor of the
      West, anxious only for his personal safety, retired to the
      perpetual confinement of the walls and morasses of Ravenna. The
      example of Honorius was imitated by his feeble successors, the
      Gothic kings, and afterwards the Exarchs, who occupied the throne
      and palace of the emperors; and till the middle of the eight
      century, Ravenna was considered as the seat of government, and
      the capital of Italy. 63

      The fears of Honorius were not without foundation, nor were his
      precautions without effect. While Italy rejoiced in her
      deliverance from the Goths, a furious tempest was excited among
      the nations of Germany, who yielded to the irresistible impulse
      that appears to have been gradually communicated from the eastern
      extremity of the continent of Asia. The Chinese annals, as they
      have been interpreted by the learned industry of the present age,
      may be usefully applied to reveal the secret and remote causes of
      the fall of the Roman empire. The extensive territory to the
      north of the great wall was possessed, after the flight of the
      Huns, by the victorious Sienpi, who were sometimes broken into
      independent tribes, and sometimes reunited under a supreme chief;
      till at length, styling themselves Topa, or masters of the earth,
      they acquired a more solid consistence, and a more formidable
      power. The Topa soon compelled the pastoral nations of the
      eastern desert to acknowledge the superiority of their arms; they
      invaded China in a period of weakness and intestine discord; and
      these fortunate Tartars, adopting the laws and manners of the
      vanquished people, founded an Imperial dynasty, which reigned
      near one hundred and sixty years over the northern provinces of
      the monarchy. Some generations before they ascended the throne of
      China, one of the Topa princes had enlisted in his cavalry a
      slave of the name of Moko, renowned for his valor, but who was
      tempted, by the fear of punishment, to desert his standard, and
      to range the desert at the head of a hundred followers. This gang
      of robbers and outlaws swelled into a camp, a tribe, a numerous
      people, distinguished by the appellation of Geougen; and their
      hereditary chieftains, the posterity of Moko the slave, assumed
      their rank among the Scythian monarchs. The youth of Toulun, the
      greatest of his descendants, was exercised by those misfortunes
      which are the school of heroes. He bravely struggled with
      adversity, broke the imperious yoke of the Topa, and became the
      legislator of his nation, and the conqueror of Tartary. His
      troops were distributed into regular bands of a hundred and of a
      thousand men; cowards were stoned to death; the most splendid
      honors were proposed as the reward of valor; and Toulun, who had
      knowledge enough to despise the learning of China, adopted only
      such arts and institutions as were favorable to the military
      spirit of his government. His tents, which he removed in the
      winter season to a more southern latitude, were pitched, during
      the summer, on the fruitful banks of the Selinga. His conquests
      stretched from Corea far beyond the River Irtish. He vanquished,
      in the country to the north of the Caspian Sea, the nation of the
      Huns; and the new title of Khan, or Cagan, expressed the fame and
      power which he derived from this memorable victory. 64

      The chain of events is interrupted, or rather is concealed, as it
      passes from the Volga to the Vistula, through the dark interval
      which separates the extreme limits of the Chinese, and of the
      Roman, geography. Yet the temper of the Barbarians, and the
      experience of successive emigrations, sufficiently declare, that
      the Huns, who were oppressed by the arms of the Geougen, soon
      withdrew from the presence of an insulting victor. The countries
      towards the Euxine were already occupied by their kindred tribes;
      and their hasty flight, which they soon converted into a bold
      attack, would more naturally be directed towards the rich and
      level plains, through which the Vistula gently flows into the
      Baltic Sea. The North must again have been alarmed, and agitated,
      by the invasion of the Huns; 6411 and the nations who retreated
      before them must have pressed with incumbent weight on the
      confines of Germany. 65 The inhabitants of those regions, which
      the ancients have assigned to the Suevi, the Vandals, and the
      Burgundians, might embrace the resolution of abandoning to the
      fugitives of Sarmatia their woods and morasses; or at least of
      discharging their superfluous numbers on the provinces of the
      Roman empire. 66 About four years after the victorious Toulun had
      assumed the title of Khan of the Geougen, another Barbarian, the
      haughty Rhodogast, or Radagaisus, 67 marched from the northern
      extremities of Germany almost to the gates of Rome, and left the
      remains of his army to achieve the destruction of the West. The
      Vandals, the Suevi, and the Burgundians, formed the strength of
      this mighty host; but the Alani, who had found a hospitable
      reception in their new seats, added their active cavalry to the
      heavy infantry of the Germans; and the Gothic adventurers crowded
      so eagerly to the standard of Radagaisus, that by some
      historians, he has been styled the King of the Goths. Twelve
      thousand warriors, distinguished above the vulgar by their noble
      birth, or their valiant deeds, glittered in the van; 68 and the
      whole multitude, which was not less than two hundred thousand
      fighting men, might be increased, by the accession of women, of
      children, and of slaves, to the amount of four hundred thousand
      persons. This formidable emigration issued from the same coast of
      the Baltic, which had poured forth the myriads of the Cimbri and
      Teutones, to assault Rome and Italy in the vigor of the republic.
      After the departure of those Barbarians, their native country,
      which was marked by the vestiges of their greatness, long
      ramparts, and gigantic moles, 69 remained, during some ages, a
      vast and dreary solitude; till the human species was renewed by
      the powers of generation, and the vacancy was filled by the
      influx of new inhabitants. The nations who now usurp an extent of
      land which they are unable to cultivate, would soon be assisted
      by the industrious poverty of their neighbors, if the government
      of Europe did not protect the claims of dominion and property.

      Chapter XXX: Revolt Of The Goths.—Part IV.

      The correspondence of nations was, in that age, so imperfect and
      precarious, that the revolutions of the North might escape the
      knowledge of the court of Ravenna; till the dark cloud, which was
      collected along the coast of the Baltic, burst in thunder upon
      the banks of the Upper Danube. The emperor of the West, if his
      ministers disturbed his amusements by the news of the impending
      danger, was satisfied with being the occasion, and the spectator,
      of the war. 70 The safety of Rome was intrusted to the counsels,
      and the sword, of Stilicho; but such was the feeble and exhausted
      state of the empire, that it was impossible to restore the
      fortifications of the Danube, or to prevent, by a vigorous
      effort, the invasion of the Germans. 71 The hopes of the vigilant
      minister of Honorius were confined to the defence of Italy. He
      once more abandoned the provinces, recalled the troops, pressed
      the new levies, which were rigorously exacted, and
      pusillanimously eluded; employed the most efficacious means to
      arrest, or allure, the deserters; and offered the gift of
      freedom, and of two pieces of gold, to all the slaves who would
      enlist. 72 By these efforts he painfully collected, from the
      subjects of a great empire, an army of thirty or forty thousand
      men, which, in the days of Scipio or Camillus, would have been
      instantly furnished by the free citizens of the territory of
      Rome. 73 The thirty legions of Stilicho were reenforced by a
      large body of Barbarian auxiliaries; the faithful Alani were
      personally attached to his service; and the troops of Huns and of
      Goths, who marched under the banners of their native princes,
      Huldin and Sarus, were animated by interest and resentment to
      oppose the ambition of Radagaisus. The king of the confederate
      Germans passed, without resistance, the Alps, the Po, and the
      Apennine; leaving on one hand the inaccessible palace of
      Honorius, securely buried among the marshes of Ravenna; and, on
      the other, the camp of Stilicho, who had fixed his head-quarters
      at Ticinum, or Pavia, but who seems to have avoided a decisive
      battle, till he had assembled his distant forces. Many cities of
      Italy were pillaged, or destroyed; and the siege of Florence, 74
      by Radagaisus, is one of the earliest events in the history of
      that celebrated republic; whose firmness checked and delayed the
      unskillful fury of the Barbarians. The senate and people trembled
      at their approach within a hundred and eighty miles of Rome; and
      anxiously compared the danger which they had escaped, with the
      new perils to which they were exposed. Alaric was a Christian and
      a soldier, the leader of a disciplined army; who understood the
      laws of war, who respected the sanctity of treaties, and who had
      familiarly conversed with the subjects of the empire in the same
      camps, and the same churches. The savage Radagaisus was a
      stranger to the manners, the religion, and even the language, of
      the civilized nations of the South. The fierceness of his temper
      was exasperated by cruel superstition; and it was universally
      believed, that he had bound himself, by a solemn vow, to reduce
      the city into a heap of stones and ashes, and to sacrifice the
      most illustrious of the Roman senators on the altars of those
      gods who were appeased by human blood. The public danger, which
      should have reconciled all domestic animosities, displayed the
      incurable madness of religious faction. The oppressed votaries of
      Jupiter and Mercury respected, in the implacable enemy of Rome,
      the character of a devout Pagan; loudly declared, that they were
      more apprehensive of the sacrifices, than of the arms, of
      Radagaisus; and secretly rejoiced in the calamities of their

      order to restore the prohibited rites and ceremonies of Paganism;
      and their treasonable hopes that the success of Radagaisus would
      be the triumph of idolatry. Compare ii. 25—M.]

      Florence was reduced to the last extremity; and the fainting
      courage of the citizens was supported only by the authority of
      St. Ambrose; who had communicated, in a dream, the promise of a
      speedy deliverance. 76 On a sudden, they beheld, from their
      walls, the banners of Stilicho, who advanced, with his united
      force, to the relief of the faithful city; and who soon marked
      that fatal spot for the grave of the Barbarian host. The apparent
      contradictions of those writers who variously relate the defeat
      of Radagaisus, may be reconciled without offering much violence
      to their respective testimonies. Orosius and Augustin, who were
      intimately connected by friendship and religion, ascribed this
      miraculous victory to the providence of God, rather than to the
      valor of man. 77 They strictly exclude every idea of chance, or
      even of bloodshed; and positively affirm, that the Romans, whose
      camp was the scene of plenty and idleness, enjoyed the distress
      of the Barbarians, slowly expiring on the sharp and barren ridge
      of the hills of Faesulae, which rise above the city of Florence.
      Their extravagant assertion that not a single soldier of the
      Christian army was killed, or even wounded, may be dismissed with
      silent contempt; but the rest of the narrative of Augustin and
      Orosius is consistent with the state of the war, and the
      character of Stilicho. Conscious that he commanded the last army
      of the republic, his prudence would not expose it, in the open
      field, to the headstrong fury of the Germans. The method of
      surrounding the enemy with strong lines of circumvallation, which
      he had twice employed against the Gothic king, was repeated on a
      larger scale, and with more considerable effect. The examples of
      Caesar must have been familiar to the most illiterate of the
      Roman warriors; and the fortifications of Dyrrachium, which
      connected twenty-four castles, by a perpetual ditch and rampart
      of fifteen miles, afforded the model of an intrenchment which
      might confine, and starve, the most numerous host of Barbarians.
      78 The Roman troops had less degenerated from the industry, than
      from the valor, of their ancestors; and if their servile and
      laborious work offended the pride of the soldiers, Tuscany could
      supply many thousand peasants, who would labor, though, perhaps,
      they would not fight, for the salvation of their native country.
      The imprisoned multitude of horses and men 79 was gradually
      destroyed, by famine rather than by the sword; but the Romans
      were exposed, during the progress of such an extensive work, to
      the frequent attacks of an impatient enemy. The despair of the
      hungry Barbarians would precipitate them against the
      fortifications of Stilicho; the general might sometimes indulge
      the ardor of his brave auxiliaries, who eagerly pressed to
      assault the camp of the Germans; and these various incidents
      might produce the sharp and bloody conflicts which dignify the
      narrative of Zosimus, and the Chronicles of Prosper and
      Marcellinus. 80 A seasonable supply of men and provisions had
      been introduced into the walls of Florence, and the famished host
      of Radagaisus was in its turn besieged. The proud monarch of so
      many warlike nations, after the loss of his bravest warriors, was
      reduced to confide either in the faith of a capitulation, or in
      the clemency of Stilicho. 81 But the death of the royal captive,
      who was ignominiously beheaded, disgraced the triumph of Rome and
      of Christianity; and the short delay of his execution was
      sufficient to brand the conqueror with the guilt of cool and
      deliberate cruelty. 82 The famished Germans, who escaped the fury
      of the auxiliaries, were sold as slaves, at the contemptible
      price of as many single pieces of gold; but the difference of
      food and climate swept away great numbers of those unhappy
      strangers; and it was observed, that the inhuman purchasers,
      instead of reaping the fruits of their labor were soon obliged to
      provide the expense of their interment. Stilicho informed the
      emperor and the senate of his success; and deserved, a second
      time, the glorious title of Deliverer of Italy. 83

      appears, he was taken in arms, cannot deserve Gibbon’s severe
      condemnation. Mr. Herbert (notes to his poem of Attila, p. 317)
      justly observes, that “Stilicho had probably authority for
      hanging him on the first tree.” Marcellinus, adds Mr. Herbert,

      discovered that the state could no longer be saved, Stilicho
      (after Romulus, Camillus and Marius) might have been worthily
      surnamed the fourth founder of Rome.]

      The fame of the victory, and more especially of the miracle, has
      encouraged a vain persuasion, that the whole army, or rather
      nation, of Germans, who migrated from the shores of the Baltic,
      miserably perished under the walls of Florence. Such indeed was
      the fate of Radagaisus himself, of his brave and faithful
      companions, and of more than one third of the various multitude
      of Sueves and Vandals, of Alani and Burgundians, who adhered to
      the standard of their general. 84 The union of such an army might
      excite our surprise, but the causes of separation are obvious and
      forcible; the pride of birth, the insolence of valor, the
      jealousy of command, the impatience of subordination, and the
      obstinate conflict of opinions, of interests, and of passions,
      among so many kings and warriors, who were untaught to yield, or
      to obey. After the defeat of Radagaisus, two parts of the German
      host, which must have exceeded the number of one hundred thousand
      men, still remained in arms, between the Apennine and the Alps,
      or between the Alps and the Danube. It is uncertain whether they
      attempted to revenge the death of their general; but their
      irregular fury was soon diverted by the prudence and firmness of
      Stilicho, who opposed their march, and facilitated their retreat;
      who considered the safety of Rome and Italy as the great object
      of his care, and who sacrificed, with too much indifference, the
      wealth and tranquillity of the distant provinces. 85 The
      Barbarians acquired, from the junction of some Pannonian
      deserters, the knowledge of the country, and of the roads; and
      the invasion of Gaul, which Alaric had designed, was executed by
      the remains of the great army of Radagaisus. 86

      early as 1771, I find the same idea expressed in a rough draught
      of the present History. I have since observed a similar
      intimation in Mascou, (viii. 15.) Such agreement, without mutual
      communication, may add some weight to our common sentiment.]

      Yet if they expected to derive any assistance from the tribes of
      Germany, who inhabited the banks of the Rhine, their hopes were
      disappointed. The Alemanni preserved a state of inactive
      neutrality; and the Franks distinguished their zeal and courage
      in the defence of the of the empire. In the rapid progress down
      the Rhine, which was the first act of the administration of
      Stilicho, he had applied himself, with peculiar attention, to
      secure the alliance of the warlike Franks, and to remove the
      irreconcilable enemies of peace and of the republic. Marcomir,
      one of their kings, was publicly convicted, before the tribunal
      of the Roman magistrate, of violating the faith of treaties. He
      was sentenced to a mild, but distant exile, in the province of
      Tuscany; and this degradation of the regal dignity was so far
      from exciting the resentment of his subjects, that they punished
      with death the turbulent Sunno, who attempted to revenge his
      brother; and maintained a dutiful allegiance to the princes, who
      were established on the throne by the choice of Stilicho. 87 When
      the limits of Gaul and Germany were shaken by the northern
      emigration, the Franks bravely encountered the single force of
      the Vandals; who, regardless of the lessons of adversity, had
      again separated their troops from the standard of their Barbarian
      allies. They paid the penalty of their rashness; and twenty
      thousand Vandals, with their king Godigisclus, were slain in the
      field of battle. The whole people must have been extirpated, if
      the squadrons of the Alani, advancing to their relief, had not
      trampled down the infantry of the Franks; who, after an honorable
      resistance, were compelled to relinquish the unequal contest. The
      victorious confederates pursued their march, and on the last day
      of the year, in a season when the waters of the Rhine were most
      probably frozen, they entered, without opposition, the
      defenceless provinces of Gaul. This memorable passage of the
      Suevi, the Vandals, the Alani, and the Burgundians, who never
      afterwards retreated, may be considered as the fall of the Roman
      empire in the countries beyond the Alps; and the barriers, which
      had so long separated the savage and the civilized nations of the
      earth, were from that fatal moment levelled with the ground. 88

      preserved a valuable fragment of Renatus Profuturus Frigeridus,
      whose three names denote a Christian, a Roman subject, and a
      Semi-Barbarian.]

      While the peace of Germany was secured by the attachment of the
      Franks, and the neutrality of the Alemanni, the subjects of Rome,
      unconscious of their approaching calamities, enjoyed the state of
      quiet and prosperity, which had seldom blessed the frontiers of
      Gaul. Their flocks and herds were permitted to graze in the
      pastures of the Barbarians; their huntsmen penetrated, without
      fear or danger, into the darkest recesses of the Hercynian wood.
      89 The banks of the Rhine were crowned, like those of the Tyber,
      with elegant houses, and well-cultivated farms; and if a poet
      descended the river, he might express his doubt, on which side
      was situated the territory of the Romans. 90 This scene of peace
      and plenty was suddenly changed into a desert; and the prospect
      of the smoking ruins could alone distinguish the solitude of
      nature from the desolation of man. The flourishing city of Mentz
      was surprised and destroyed; and many thousand Christians were
      inhumanly massacred in the church. Worms perished after a long
      and obstinate siege; Strasburgh, Spires, Rheims, Tournay, Arras,
      Amiens, experienced the cruel oppression of the German yoke; and
      the consuming flames of war spread from the banks of the Rhine
      over the greatest part of the seventeen provinces of Gaul. That
      rich and extensive country, as far as the ocean, the Alps, and
      the Pyrenees, was delivered to the Barbarians, who drove before
      them, in a promiscuous crowd, the bishop, the senator, and the
      virgin, laden with the spoils of their houses and altars. 91 The
      ecclesiastics, to whom we are indebted for this vague description
      of the public calamities, embraced the opportunity of exhorting
      the Christians to repent of the sins which had provoked the
      Divine Justice, and to renounce the perishable goods of a
      wretched and deceitful world. But as the Pelagian controversy, 92
      which attempts to sound the abyss of grace and predestination,
      soon became the serious employment of the Latin clergy, the
      Providence which had decreed, or foreseen, or permitted, such a
      train of moral and natural evils, was rashly weighed in the
      imperfect and fallacious balance of reason. The crimes, and the
      misfortunes, of the suffering people, were presumptuously
      compared with those of their ancestors; and they arraigned the
      Divine Justice, which did not exempt from the common destruction
      the feeble, the guiltless, the infant portion of the human
      species. These idle disputants overlooked the invariable laws of
      nature, which have connected peace with innocence, plenty with
      industry, and safety with valor. The timid and selfish policy of
      the court of Ravenna might recall the Palatine legions for the
      protection of Italy; the remains of the stationary troops might
      be unequal to the arduous task; and the Barbarian auxiliaries
      might prefer the unbounded license of spoil to the benefits of a
      moderate and regular stipend. But the provinces of Gaul were
      filled with a numerous race of hardy and robust youth, who, in
      the defence of their houses, their families, and their altars, if
      they had dared to die, would have deserved to vanquish. The
      knowledge of their native country would have enabled them to
      oppose continual and insuperable obstacles to the progress of an
      invader; and the deficiency of the Barbarians, in arms, as well
      as in discipline, removed the only pretence which excuses the
      submission of a populous country to the inferior numbers of a
      veteran army. When France was invaded by Charles V., he inquired
      of a prisoner, how many days Paris might be distant from the
      frontier; “Perhaps twelve, but they will be days of battle:” 93
      such was the gallant answer which checked the arrogance of that
      ambitious prince. The subjects of Honorius, and those of Francis
      I., were animated by a very different spirit; and in less than
      two years, the divided troops of the savages of the Baltic, whose
      numbers, were they fairly stated, would appear contemptible,
      advanced, without a combat, to the foot of the Pyrenean
      Mountains.

      In the early part of the reign of Honorius, the vigilance of
      Stilicho had successfully guarded the remote island of Britain
      from her incessant enemies of the ocean, the mountains, and the
      Irish coast. 94 But those restless Barbarians could not neglect
      the fair opportunity of the Gothic war, when the walls and
      stations of the province were stripped of the Roman troops. If
      any of the legionaries were permitted to return from the Italian
      expedition, their faithful report of the court and character of
      Honorius must have tended to dissolve the bonds of allegiance,
      and to exasperate the seditious temper of the British army. The
      spirit of revolt, which had formerly disturbed the age of
      Gallienus, was revived by the capricious violence of the
      soldiers; and the unfortunate, perhaps the ambitious, candidates,
      who were the objects of their choice, were the instruments, and
      at length the victims, of their passion. 95 Marcus was the first
      whom they placed on the throne, as the lawful emperor of Britain
      and of the West. They violated, by the hasty murder of Marcus,
      the oath of fidelity which they had imposed on themselves; and
      their disapprobation of his manners may seem to inscribe an
      honorable epitaph on his tomb. Gratian was the next whom they
      adorned with the diadem and the purple; and, at the end of four
      months, Gratian experienced the fate of his predecessor. The
      memory of the great Constantine, whom the British legions had
      given to the church and to the empire, suggested the singular
      motive of their third choice. They discovered in the ranks a
      private soldier of the name of Constantine, and their impetuous
      levity had already seated him on the throne, before they
      perceived his incapacity to sustain the weight of that glorious
      appellation. 96 Yet the authority of Constantine was less
      precarious, and his government was more successful, than the
      transient reigns of Marcus and of Gratian. The danger of leaving
      his inactive troops in those camps, which had been twice polluted
      with blood and sedition, urged him to attempt the reduction of
      the Western provinces. He landed at Boulogne with an
      inconsiderable force; and after he had reposed himself some days,
      he summoned the cities of Gaul, which had escaped the yoke of the
      Barbarians, to acknowledge their lawful sovereign. They obeyed
      the summons without reluctance. The neglect of the court of
      Ravenna had absolved a deserted people from the duty of
      allegiance; their actual distress encouraged them to accept any
      circumstances of change, without apprehension, and, perhaps, with
      some degree of hope; and they might flatter themselves, that the
      troops, the authority, and even the name of a Roman emperor, who
      fixed his residence in Gaul, would protect the unhappy country
      from the rage of the Barbarians. The first successes of
      Constantine against the detached parties of the Germans, were
      magnified by the voice of adulation into splendid and decisive
      victories; which the reunion and insolence of the enemy soon
      reduced to their just value. His negotiations procured a short
      and precarious truce; and if some tribes of the Barbarians were
      engaged, by the liberality of his gifts and promises, to
      undertake the defence of the Rhine, these expensive and uncertain
      treaties, instead of restoring the pristine vigor of the Gallic
      frontier, served only to disgrace the majesty of the prince, and
      to exhaust what yet remained of the treasures of the republic.
      Elated, however, with this imaginary triumph, the vain deliverer
      of Gaul advanced into the provinces of the South, to encounter a
      more pressing and personal danger. Sarus the Goth was ordered to
      lay the head of the rebel at the feet of the emperor Honorius;
      and the forces of Britain and Italy were unworthily consumed in
      this domestic quarrel. After the loss of his two bravest
      generals, Justinian and Nevigastes, the former of whom was slain
      in the field of battle, the latter in a peaceful but treacherous
      interview, Constantine fortified himself within the walls of
      Vienna. The place was ineffectually attacked seven days; and the
      Imperial army supported, in a precipitate retreat, the ignominy
      of purchasing a secure passage from the freebooters and outlaws
      of the Alps. 97 Those mountains now separated the dominions of
      two rival monarchs; and the fortifications of the double frontier
      were guarded by the troops of the empire, whose arms would have
      been more usefully employed to maintain the Roman limits against
      the Barbarians of Germany and Scythia.

      Chapter XXX: Revolt Of The Goths.—Part V.

      On the side of the Pyrenees, the ambition of Constantine might be
      justified by the proximity of danger; but his throne was soon
      established by the conquest, or rather submission, of Spain;
      which yielded to the influence of regular and habitual
      subordination, and received the laws and magistrates of the
      Gallic præfecture. The only opposition which was made to the
      authority of Constantine proceeded not so much from the powers of
      government, or the spirit of the people, as from the private zeal
      and interest of the family of Theodosius. Four brothers 98 had
      obtained, by the favor of their kinsman, the deceased emperor, an
      honorable rank and ample possessions in their native country; and
      the grateful youths resolved to risk those advantages in the
      service of his son. After an unsuccessful effort to maintain
      their ground at the head of the stationary troops of Lusitania,
      they retired to their estates; where they armed and levied, at
      their own expense, a considerable body of slaves and dependants,
      and boldly marched to occupy the strong posts of the Pyrenean
      Mountains. This domestic insurrection alarmed and perplexed the
      sovereign of Gaul and Britain; and he was compelled to negotiate
      with some troops of Barbarian auxiliaries, for the service of the
      Spanish war. They were distinguished by the title of Honorians;
      99 a name which might have reminded them of their fidelity to
      their lawful sovereign; and if it should candidly be allowed that
      the Scots were influenced by any partial affection for a British
      prince, the Moors and the Marcomanni could be tempted only by the
      profuse liberality of the usurper, who distributed among the
      Barbarians the military, and even the civil, honors of Spain. The
      nine bands of Honorians, which may be easily traced on the
      establishment of the Western empire, could not exceed the number
      of five thousand men: yet this inconsiderable force was
      sufficient to terminate a war, which had threatened the power and
      safety of Constantine. The rustic army of the Theodosian family
      was surrounded and destroyed in the Pyrenees: two of the brothers
      had the good fortune to escape by sea to Italy, or the East; the
      other two, after an interval of suspense, were executed at Arles;
      and if Honorius could remain insensible of the public disgrace,
      he might perhaps be affected by the personal misfortunes of his
      generous kinsmen. Such were the feeble arms which decided the
      possession of the Western provinces of Europe, from the wall of
      Antoninus to the columns of Hercules. The events of peace and war
      have undoubtedly been diminished by the narrow and imperfect view
      of the historians of the times, who were equally ignorant of the
      causes, and of the effects, of the most important revolutions.
      But the total decay of the national strength had annihilated even
      the last resource of a despotic government; and the revenue of
      exhausted provinces could no longer purchase the military service
      of a discontented and pusillanimous people.

      99 (return) [ These Honoriani, or Honoriaci, consisted of two

      sect. xxxiii. edit. Lab.) They were part of the sixty-five
      Auxilia Palatina, and are properly styled by Zosimus, (l. vi.
      374.)]

      The poet, whose flattery has ascribed to the Roman eagle the
      victories of Pollentia and Verona, pursues the hasty retreat of
      Alaric, from the confines of Italy, with a horrid train of
      imaginary spectres, such as might hover over an army of
      Barbarians, which was almost exterminated by war, famine, and
      disease. 100 In the course of this unfortunate expedition, the
      king of the Goths must indeed have sustained a considerable loss;
      and his harassed forces required an interval of repose, to
      recruit their numbers and revive their confidence. Adversity had
      exercised and displayed the genius of Alaric; and the fame of his
      valor invited to the Gothic standard the bravest of the Barbarian
      warriors; who, from the Euxine to the Rhine, were agitated by the
      desire of rapine and conquest. He had deserved the esteem, and he
      soon accepted the friendship, of Stilicho himself. Renouncing the
      service of the emperor of the East, Alaric concluded, with the
      court of Ravenna, a treaty of peace and alliance, by which he was
      declared master-general of the Roman armies throughout the
      præfecture of Illyricum; as it was claimed, according to the
      true and ancient limits, by the minister of Honorius. 101 The
      execution of the ambitious design, which was either stipulated,
      or implied, in the articles of the treaty, appears to have been
      suspended by the formidable irruption of Radagaisus; and the
      neutrality of the Gothic king may perhaps be compared to the
      indifference of Caesar, who, in the conspiracy of Catiline,
      refused either to assist, or to oppose, the enemy of the
      republic. After the defeat of the Vandals, Stilicho resumed his
      pretensions to the provinces of the East; appointed civil
      magistrates for the administration of justice, and of the
      finances; and declared his impatience to lead to the gates of
      Constantinople the united armies of the Romans and of the Goths.
      The prudence, however, of Stilicho, his aversion to civil war,
      and his perfect knowledge of the weakness of the state, may
      countenance the suspicion, that domestic peace, rather than
      foreign conquest, was the object of his policy; and that his
      principal care was to employ the forces of Alaric at a distance
      from Italy. This design could not long escape the penetration of
      the Gothic king, who continued to hold a doubtful, and perhaps a
      treacherous, correspondence with the rival courts; who
      protracted, like a dissatisfied mercenary, his languid operations
      in Thessaly and Epirus, and who soon returned to claim the
      extravagant reward of his ineffectual services. From his camp
      near Aemona, 102 on the confines of Italy, he transmitted to the
      emperor of the West a long account of promises, of expenses, and
      of demands; called for immediate satisfaction, and clearly
      intimated the consequences of a refusal. Yet if his conduct was
      hostile, his language was decent and dutiful. He humbly professed
      himself the friend of Stilicho, and the soldier of Honorius;
      offered his person and his troops to march, without delay,
      against the usurper of Gaul; and solicited, as a permanent
      retreat for the Gothic nation, the possession of some vacant
      province of the Western empire.

      10) cast a pale and doubtful light; and Orosius (l. vii. c. 38,
      p. 571) is abominably partial.]

      The political and secret transactions of two statesmen, who
      labored to deceive each other and the world, must forever have
      been concealed in the impenetrable darkness of the cabinet, if
      the debates of a popular assembly had not thrown some rays of
      light on the correspondence of Alaric and Stilicho. The necessity
      of finding some artificial support for a government, which, from
      a principle, not of moderation, but of weakness, was reduced to
      negotiate with its own subjects, had insensibly revived the
      authority of the Roman senate; and the minister of Honorius
      respectfully consulted the legislative council of the republic.
      Stilicho assembled the senate in the palace of the Caesars;
      represented, in a studied oration, the actual state of affairs;
      proposed the demands of the Gothic king, and submitted to their
      consideration the choice of peace or war. The senators, as if
      they had been suddenly awakened from a dream of four hundred
      years, appeared, on this important occasion, to be inspired by
      the courage, rather than by the wisdom, of their predecessors.
      They loudly declared, in regular speeches, or in tumultuary
      acclamations, that it was unworthy of the majesty of Rome to
      purchase a precarious and disgraceful truce from a Barbarian
      king; and that, in the judgment of a magnanimous people, the
      chance of ruin was always preferable to the certainty of
      dishonor. The minister, whose pacific intentions were seconded
      only by the voice of a few servile and venal followers, attempted
      to allay the general ferment, by an apology for his own conduct,
      and even for the demands of the Gothic prince. “The payment of a
      subsidy, which had excited the indignation of the Romans, ought
      not (such was the language of Stilicho) to be considered in the
      odious light, either of a tribute, or of a ransom, extorted by
      the menaces of a Barbarian enemy. Alaric had faithfully asserted
      the just pretensions of the republic to the provinces which were
      usurped by the Greeks of Constantinople: he modestly required the
      fair and stipulated recompense of his services; and if he had
      desisted from the prosecution of his enterprise, he had obeyed,
      in his retreat, the peremptory, though private, letters of the
      emperor himself. These contradictory orders (he would not
      dissemble the errors of his own family) had been procured by the
      intercession of Serena. The tender piety of his wife had been too
      deeply affected by the discord of the royal brothers, the sons of
      her adopted father; and the sentiments of nature had too easily
      prevailed over the stern dictates of the public welfare.” These
      ostensible reasons, which faintly disguise the obscure intrigues
      of the palace of Ravenna, were supported by the authority of
      Stilicho; and obtained, after a warm debate, the reluctant
      approbation of the senate. The tumult of virtue and freedom
      subsided; and the sum of four thousand pounds of gold was
      granted, under the name of a subsidy, to secure the peace of
      Italy, and to conciliate the friendship of the king of the Goths.
      Lampadius alone, one of the most illustrious members of the
      assembly, still persisted in his dissent; exclaimed, with a loud
      voice, “This is not a treaty of peace, but of servitude;” 103 and
      escaped the danger of such bold opposition by immediately
      retiring to the sanctuary of a Christian church. [See Palace Of
      The Caesars]

      103 (return) [ Zosimus, l. v. p. 338, 339. He repeats the words
      of Lampadius, as they were spoke in Latin, “Non est ista pax, sed
      pactio servi tutis,” and then translates them into Greek for the
      benefit of his readers. * Note: From Cicero’s XIIth Philippic,
      14.—M.]

      But the reign of Stilicho drew towards its end; and the proud
      minister might perceive the symptoms of his approaching disgrace.
      The generous boldness of Lampadius had been applauded; and the
      senate, so patiently resigned to a long servitude, rejected with
      disdain the offer of invidious and imaginary freedom. The troops,
      who still assumed the name and prerogatives of the Roman legions,
      were exasperated by the partial affection of Stilicho for the
      Barbarians: and the people imputed to the mischievous policy of
      the minister the public misfortunes, which were the natural
      consequence of their own degeneracy. Yet Stilicho might have
      continued to brave the clamors of the people, and even of the
      soldiers, if he could have maintained his dominion over the
      feeble mind of his pupil. But the respectful attachment of
      Honorius was converted into fear, suspicion, and hatred. The
      crafty Olympius, 104 who concealed his vices under the mask of
      Christian piety, had secretly undermined the benefactor, by whose
      favor he was promoted to the honorable offices of the Imperial
      palace. Olympius revealed to the unsuspecting emperor, who had
      attained the twenty-fifth year of his age, that he was without
      weight, or authority, in his own government; and artfully alarmed
      his timid and indolent disposition by a lively picture of the
      designs of Stilicho, who already meditated the death of his
      sovereign, with the ambitious hope of placing the diadem on the
      head of his son Eucherius. The emperor was instigated, by his new
      favorite, to assume the tone of independent dignity; and the
      minister was astonished to find, that secret resolutions were
      formed in the court and council, which were repugnant to his
      interest, or to his intentions. Instead of residing in the palace
      of Rome, Honorius declared that it was his pleasure to return to
      the secure fortress of Ravenna. On the first intelligence of the
      death of his brother Arcadius, he prepared to visit
      Constantinople, and to regulate, with the authority of a
      guardian, the provinces of the infant Theodosius. 105 The
      representation of the difficulty and expense of such a distant
      expedition, checked this strange and sudden sally of active
      diligence; but the dangerous project of showing the emperor to
      the camp of Pavia, which was composed of the Roman troops, the
      enemies of Stilicho, and his Barbarian auxiliaries, remained
      fixed and unalterable. The minister was pressed, by the advice of
      his confidant, Justinian, a Roman advocate, of a lively and
      penetrating genius, to oppose a journey so prejudicial to his
      reputation and safety. His strenuous but ineffectual efforts
      confirmed the triumph of Olympius; and the prudent lawyer
      withdrew himself from the impending ruin of his patron.

      of the church, (Baronius, Annal. Eccles, Eccles. A.D. 408, No.
      19, &c. Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xiii. p. 467, 468.) But
      these praises, which the African saint so unworthily bestows,
      might proceed as well from ignorance as from adulation.]

      Stilicho offered to undertake the journey to Constantinople, that
      he might divert Honorius from the vain attempt. The Eastern
      empire would not have obeyed, and could not have been conquered.]

      In the passage of the emperor through Bologna, a mutiny of the
      guards was excited and appeased by the secret policy of Stilicho;
      who announced his instructions to decimate the guilty, and
      ascribed to his own intercession the merit of their pardon. After
      this tumult, Honorius embraced, for the last time, the minister
      whom he now considered as a tyrant, and proceeded on his way to
      the camp of Pavia; where he was received by the loyal
      acclamations of the troops who were assembled for the service of
      the Gallic war. On the morning of the fourth day, he pronounced,
      as he had been taught, a military oration in the presence of the
      soldiers, whom the charitable visits, and artful discourses, of
      Olympius had prepared to execute a dark and bloody conspiracy. At
      the first signal, they massacred the friends of Stilicho, the
      most illustrious officers of the empire; two Prætorian
      præfects, of Gaul and of Italy; two masters-general of the
      cavalry and infantry; the master of the offices; the quaestor,
      the treasurer, and the count of the domestics. Many lives were
      lost; many houses were plundered; the furious sedition continued
      to rage till the close of the evening; and the trembling emperor,
      who was seen in the streets of Pavia without his robes or diadem,
      yielded to the persuasions of his favorite; condemned the memory
      of the slain; and solemnly approved the innocence and fidelity of
      their assassins. The intelligence of the massacre of Pavia filled
      the mind of Stilicho with just and gloomy apprehensions; and he
      instantly summoned, in the camp of Bologna, a council of the
      confederate leaders, who were attached to his service, and would
      be involved in his ruin. The impetuous voice of the assembly
      called aloud for arms, and for revenge; to march, without a
      moment’s delay, under the banners of a hero, whom they had so
      often followed to victory; to surprise, to oppress, to extirpate
      the guilty Olympius, and his degenerate Romans; and perhaps to
      fix the diadem on the head of their injured general. Instead of
      executing a resolution, which might have been justified by
      success, Stilicho hesitated till he was irrecoverably lost. He
      was still ignorant of the fate of the emperor; he distrusted the
      fidelity of his own party; and he viewed with horror the fatal
      consequences of arming a crowd of licentious Barbarians against
      the soldiers and people of Italy. The confederates, impatient of
      his timorous and doubtful delay, hastily retired, with fear and
      indignation. At the hour of midnight, Sarus, a Gothic warrior,
      renowned among the Barbarians themselves for his strength and
      valor, suddenly invaded the camp of his benefactor, plundered the
      baggage, cut in pieces the faithful Huns, who guarded his person,
      and penetrated to the tent, where the minister, pensive and
      sleepless, meditated on the dangers of his situation. Stilicho
      escaped with difficulty from the sword of the Goths and, after
      issuing a last and generous admonition to the cities of Italy, to
      shut their gates against the Barbarians, his confidence, or his
      despair, urged him to throw himself into Ravenna, which was
      already in the absolute possession of his enemies. Olympius, who
      had assumed the dominion of Honorius, was speedily informed, that
      his rival had embraced, as a suppliant the altar of the Christian
      church. The base and cruel disposition of the hypocrite was
      incapable of pity or remorse; but he piously affected to elude,
      rather than to violate, the privilege of the sanctuary. Count
      Heraclian, with a troop of soldiers, appeared, at the dawn of
      day, before the gates of the church of Ravenna. The bishop was
      satisfied by a solemn oath, that the Imperial mandate only
      directed them to secure the person of Stilicho: but as soon as
      the unfortunate minister had been tempted beyond the holy
      threshold, he produced the warrant for his instant execution.
      Stilicho supported, with calm resignation, the injurious names of
      traitor and parricide; repressed the unseasonable zeal of his
      followers, who were ready to attempt an ineffectual rescue; and,
      with a firmness not unworthy of the last of the Roman generals,
      submitted his neck to the sword of Heraclian. 106

      3, l. xii. c. 2,) afford supplemental hints.]

      The servile crowd of the palace, who had so long adored the
      fortune of Stilicho, affected to insult his fall; and the most
      distant connection with the master-general of the West, which had
      so lately been a title to wealth and honors, was studiously
      denied, and rigorously punished. His family, united by a triple
      alliance with the family of Theodosius, might envy the condition
      of the meanest peasant. The flight of his son Eucherius was
      intercepted; and the death of that innocent youth soon followed
      the divorce of Thermantia, who filled the place of her sister
      Maria; and who, like Maria, had remained a virgin in the Imperial
      bed. 107 The friends of Stilicho, who had escaped the massacre of
      Pavia, were persecuted by the implacable revenge of Olympius; and
      the most exquisite cruelty was employed to extort the confession
      of a treasonable and sacrilegious conspiracy. They died in
      silence: their firmness justified the choice, 108 and perhaps
      absolved the innocence of their patron: and the despotic power,
      which could take his life without a trial, and stigmatize his
      memory without a proof, has no jurisdiction over the impartial
      suffrage of posterity. 109 The services of Stilicho are great and
      manifest; his crimes, as they are vaguely stated in the language
      of flattery and hatred, are obscure at least, and improbable.
      About four months after his death, an edict was published, in the
      name of Honorius, to restore the free communication of the two
      empires, which had been so long interrupted by the public enemy.
      110 The minister, whose fame and fortune depended on the
      prosperity of the state, was accused of betraying Italy to the
      Barbarians; whom he repeatedly vanquished at Pollentia, at
      Verona, and before the walls of Florence. His pretended design of
      placing the diadem on the head of his son Eucherius, could not
      have been conducted without preparations or accomplices; and the
      ambitious father would not surely have left the future emperor,
      till the twentieth year of his age, in the humble station of
      tribune of the notaries. Even the religion of Stilicho was
      arraigned by the malice of his rival. The seasonable, and almost
      miraculous, deliverance was devoutly celebrated by the applause
      of the clergy; who asserted, that the restoration of idols, and
      the persecution of the church, would have been the first measure
      of the reign of Eucherius. The son of Stilicho, however, was
      educated in the bosom of Christianity, which his father had
      uniformly professed, and zealously supported. 111 1111 Serena had
      borrowed her magnificent necklace from the statue of Vesta; 112
      and the Pagans execrated the memory of the sacrilegious minister,
      by whose order the Sibylline books, the oracles of Rome, had been
      committed to the flames. 113 The pride and power of Stilicho
      constituted his real guilt. An honorable reluctance to shed the
      blood of his countrymen appears to have contributed to the
      success of his unworthy rival; and it is the last humiliation of
      the character of Honorius, that posterity has not condescended to
      reproach him with his base ingratitude to the guardian of his
      youth, and the support of his empire.

      engraven under them, (Zosimus, l. v. p. 352.) These are foolish
      stories: yet the charge of impiety adds weight and credit to the
      praise which Zosimus reluctantly bestows on his virtues. Note:

     patron.]

      Among the train of dependants whose wealth and dignity attracted
      the notice of their own times, _our_ curiosity is excited by the
      celebrated name of the poet Claudian, who enjoyed the favor of
      Stilicho, and was overwhelmed in the ruin of his patron. The
      titular offices of tribune and notary fixed his rank in the
      Imperial court: he was indebted to the powerful intercession of
      Serena for his marriage with a very rich heiress of the province
      of Africa; 114 and the statute of Claudian, erected in the forum
      of Trajan, was a monument of the taste and liberality of the
      Roman senate. 115 After the praises of Stilicho became offensive
      and criminal, Claudian was exposed to the enmity of a powerful
      and unforgiving courtier, whom he had provoked by the insolence
      of wit. He had compared, in a lively epigram, the opposite
      characters of two Prætorian præfects of Italy; he contrasts the
      innocent repose of a philosopher, who sometimes resigned the
      hours of business to slumber, perhaps to study, with the
      interesting diligence of a rapacious minister, indefatigable in
      the pursuit of unjust or sacrilegious, gain. “How happy,”
      continues Claudian, “how happy might it be for the people of
      Italy, if Mallius could be constantly awake, and if Hadrian would
      always sleep!” 116 The repose of Mallius was not disturbed by
      this friendly and gentle admonition; but the cruel vigilance of
      Hadrian watched the opportunity of revenge, and easily obtained,
      from the enemies of Stilicho, the trifling sacrifice of an
      obnoxious poet. The poet concealed himself, however, during the
      tumult of the revolution; and, consulting the dictates of
      prudence rather than of honor, he addressed, in the form of an
      epistle, a suppliant and humble recantation to the offended
      præfect. He deplores, in mournful strains, the fatal
      indiscretion into which he had been hurried by passion and folly;
      submits to the imitation of his adversary the generous examples
      of the clemency of gods, of heroes, and of lions; and expresses
      his hope that the magnanimity of Hadrian will not trample on a
      defenceless and contemptible foe, already humbled by disgrace and
      poverty, and deeply wounded by the exile, the tortures, and the
      death of his dearest friends. 117 Whatever might be the success
      of his prayer, or the accidents of his future life, the period of
      a few years levelled in the grave the minister and the poet: but
      the name of Hadrian is almost sunk in oblivion, while Claudian is
      read with pleasure in every country which has retained, or
      acquired, the knowledge of the Latin language. If we fairly
      balance his merits and his defects, we shall acknowledge that
      Claudian does not either satisfy, or silence, our reason. It
      would not be easy to produce a passage that deserves the epithet
      of sublime or pathetic; to select a verse that melts the heart or
      enlarges the imagination. We should vainly seek, in the poems of
      Claudian, the happy invention, and artificial conduct, of an
      interesting fable; or the just and lively representation of the
      characters and situations of real life. For the service of his
      patron, he published occasional panegyrics and invectives: and
      the design of these slavish compositions encouraged his
      propensity to exceed the limits of truth and nature. These
      imperfections, however, are compensated in some degree by the
      poetical virtues of Claudian. He was endowed with the rare and
      precious talent of raising the meanest, of adorning the most
      barren, and of diversifying the most similar, topics: his
      coloring, more especially in descriptive poetry, is soft and
      splendid; and he seldom fails to display, and even to abuse, the
      advantages of a cultivated understanding, a copious fancy, an
      easy, and sometimes forcible, expression; and a perpetual flow of
      harmonious versification. To these commendations, independent of
      any accidents of time and place, we must add the peculiar merit
      which Claudian derived from the unfavorable circumstances of his
      birth. In the decline of arts, and of empire, a native of Egypt,
      118 who had received the education of a Greek, assumed, in a
      mature age, the familiar use, and absolute command, of the Latin
      language; 119 soared above the heads of his feeble
      contemporaries; and placed himself, after an interval of three
      hundred years, among the poets of ancient Rome. 120

      114 (return) [ At the nuptials of Orpheus (a modest comparison!)
      all the parts of animated nature contributed their various gifts;
      and the gods themselves enriched their favorite. Claudian had
      neither flocks, nor herds, nor vines, nor olives. His wealthy
      bride was heiress to them all. But he carried to Africa a
      recommendatory letter from Serena, his Juno, and was made happy,
      (Epist. ii. ad Serenam.)]

      115 (return) [ Claudian feels the honor like a man who deserved
      it, (in praefat Bell. Get.) The original inscription, on marble,
      was found at Rome, in the fifteenth century, in the house of
      Pomponius Laetus. The statue of a poet, far superior to Claudian,
      should have been erected, during his lifetime, by the men of
      letters, his countrymen and contemporaries. It was a noble
      design.]

      Hadrian was a Pharian, (of Alexandrian.) See his public life in
      Godefroy, Cod. Theodos. tom. vi. p. 364. Mallius did not always

      natural philosophy, (Claud, in Mall. Theodor. Cons. 61-112.)]

      117 (return) [ See Claudian’s first Epistle. Yet, in some places,
      an air of irony and indignation betrays his secret reluctance. *
      Note: M. Beugnot has pointed out one remarkable characteristic of
      Claudian’s poetry, and of the times—his extraordinary religious
      indifference. Here is a poet writing at the actual crisis of the
      complete triumph of the new religion, the visible extinction of
      the old: if we may so speak, a strictly historical poet, whose
      works, excepting his Mythological poem on the rape of Proserpine,
      are confined to temporary subjects, and to the politics of his
      own eventful day; yet, excepting in one or two small and
      indifferent pieces, manifestly written by a Christian, and
      interpolated among his poems, there is no allusion whatever to
      the great religious strife. No one would know the existence of
      Christianity at that period of the world, by reading the works of
      Claudian. His panegyric and his satire preserve the same
      religious impartiality; award their most lavish praise or their
      bitterest invective on Christian or Pagan; he insults the fall of
      Eugenius, and glories in the victories of Theodosius. Under the
      child,—and Honorius never became more than a child,—Christianity
      continued to inflict wounds more and more deadly on expiring
      Paganism. Are the gods of Olympus agitated with apprehension at
      the birth of this new enemy? They are introduced as rejoicing at
      his appearance, and promising long years of glory. The whole
      prophetic choir of Paganism, all the oracles throughout the
      world, are summoned to predict the felicity of his reign. His
      birth is compared to that of Apollo, but the narrow limits of an
      island must not confine the new deity—

     ... Non littora nostro Sufficerent angusta Deo.

      Augury and divination, the shrines of Ammon, and of Delphi, the
      Persian Magi, and the Etruscan seers, the Chaldean astrologers,
      the Sibyl herself, are described as still discharging their
      prophetic functions, and celebrating the natal day of this
      Christian prince. They are noble lines, as well as curious
      illustrations of the times:

     ... Quae tunc documenta futuri? Quae voces avium? quanti per inane
     volatus? Quis vatum discursus erat?  Tibi corniger Ammon, Et dudum
     taciti rupere silentia Delphi. Te Persae cecinere Magi, te sensit
     Etruscus Augur, et inspectis Babylonius horruit astris; Chaldaei
     stupuere senes, Cumanaque rursus Itonuit rupes, rabidae delubra
     Sibyllae. —Claud. iv. Cons. Hon. 141.

      Besides some Greek epigrams, which are still extant, the Latin
      poet had composed, in Greek, the Antiquities of Tarsus,
      Anazarbus, Berytus, Nice, &c. It is more easy to supply the loss
      of good poetry, than of authentic history.]
