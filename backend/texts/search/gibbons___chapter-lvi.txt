      The three great nations of the world, the Greeks, the Saracens,
      and the Franks, encountered each other on the theatre of Italy. 1
      The southern provinces, which now compose the kingdom of Naples,
      were subject, for the most part, to the Lombard dukes and princes
      of Beneventum; 2 so powerful in war, that they checked for a
      moment the genius of Charlemagne; so liberal in peace, that they
      maintained in their capital an academy of thirty-two philosophers
      and grammarians. The division of this flourishing state produced
      the rival principalities of Benevento, Salerno, and Capua; and
      the thoughtless ambition or revenge of the competitors invited
      the Saracens to the ruin of their common inheritance. During a
      calamitous period of two hundred years, Italy was exposed to a
      repetition of wounds, which the invaders were not capable of
      healing by the union and tranquility of a perfect conquest. Their
      frequent and almost annual squadrons issued from the port of
      Palermo, and were entertained with too much indulgence by the
      Christians of Naples: the more formidable fleets were prepared on
      the African coast; and even the Arabs of Andalusia were sometimes
      tempted to assist or oppose the Moslems of an adverse sect. In
      the revolution of human events, a new ambuscade was concealed in
      the Caudine Forks, the fields of Cannae were bedewed a second
      time with the blood of the Africans, and the sovereign of Rome
      again attacked or defended the walls of Capua and Tarentum. A
      colony of Saracens had been planted at Bari, which commands the
      entrance of the Adriatic Gulf; and their impartial depredations
      provoked the resentment, and conciliated the union of the two
      emperors. An offensive alliance was concluded between Basil the
      Macedonian, the first of his race, and Lewis the great-grandson
      of Charlemagne; 3 and each party supplied the deficiencies of his
      associate. It would have been imprudent in the Byzantine monarch
      to transport his stationary troops of Asia to an Italian
      campaign; and the Latin arms would have been insufficient if his
      superior navy had not occupied the mouth of the Gulf. The
      fortress of Bari was invested by the infantry of the Franks, and
      by the cavalry and galleys of the Greeks; and, after a defence of
      four years, the Arabian emir submitted to the clemency of Lewis,
      who commanded in person the operations of the siege. This
      important conquest had been achieved by the concord of the East
      and West; but their recent amity was soon imbittered by the
      mutual complaints of jealousy and pride. The Greeks assumed as
      their own the merit of the conquest and the pomp of the triumph;
      extolled the greatness of their powers, and affected to deride
      the intemperance and sloth of the handful of Barbarians who
      appeared under the banners of the Carlovingian prince. His reply
      is expressed with the eloquence of indignation and truth: “We
      confess the magnitude of your preparation,” says the
      great-grandson of Charlemagne. “Your armies were indeed as
      numerous as a cloud of summer locusts, who darken the day, flap
      their wings, and, after a short flight, tumble weary and
      breathless to the ground. Like them, ye sunk after a feeble
      effort; ye were vanquished by your own cowardice; and withdrew
      from the scene of action to injure and despoil our Christian
      subjects of the Sclavonian coast. We were few in number, and why
      were we few? Because, after a tedious expectation of your
      arrival, I had dismissed my host, and retained only a chosen band
      of warriors to continue the blockade of the city. If they
      indulged their hospitable feasts in the face of danger and death,
      did these feasts abate the vigor of their enterprise? Is it by
      your fasting that the walls of Bari have been overturned? Did not
      these valiant Franks, diminished as they were by languor and
      fatigue, intercept and vanish the three most powerful emirs of
      the Saracens? and did not their defeat precipitate the fall of
      the city? Bari is now fallen; Tarentum trembles; Calabria will be
      delivered; and, if we command the sea, the Island of Sicily may
      be rescued from the hands of the infidels. My brother,”
      accelerate (a name most offensive to the vanity of the Greek,)
      “accelerate your naval succors, respect your allies, and distrust
      your flatterers.” 4

      4 (return) [ The oriental epistle of the emperor Lewis II. to the
      emperor Basil, a curious record of the age, was first published
      by Baronius, (Annal. Eccles. A.D. 871, No. 51-71,) from the
      Vatican Ms. of Erchempert, or rather of the anonymous historian
      of Salerno.] These lofty hopes were soon extinguished by the
      death of Lewis, and the decay of the Carlovingian house; and
      whoever might deserve the honor, the Greek emperors, Basil, and
      his son Leo, secured the advantage, of the reduction of Bari. The
      Italians of Apulia and Calabria were persuaded or compelled to
      acknowledge their supremacy, and an ideal line from Mount
      Garganus to the Bay of Salerno, leaves the far greater part of
      the kingdom of Naples under the dominion of the Eastern empire.
      Beyond that line, the dukes or republics of Amalfi 5 and Naples,
      who had never forfeited their voluntary allegiance, rejoiced in
      the neighborhood of their lawful sovereign; and Amalfi was
      enriched by supplying Europe with the produce and manufactures of
      Asia. But the Lombard princes of Benevento, Salerno, and Capua, 6
      were reluctantly torn from the communion of the Latin world, and
      too often violated their oaths of servitude and tribute. The city
      of Bari rose to dignity and wealth, as the metropolis of the new
      theme or province of Lombardy: the title of patrician, and
      afterwards the singular name of Catapan, 7 was assigned to the
      supreme governor; and the policy both of the church and state was
      modelled in exact subordination to the throne of Constantinople.
      As long as the sceptre was disputed by the princes of Italy,
      their efforts were feeble and adverse; and the Greeks resisted or
      eluded the forces of Germany, which descended from the Alps under
      the Imperial standard of the Othos. The first and greatest of
      those Saxon princes was compelled to relinquish the siege of
      Bari: the second, after the loss of his stoutest bishops and
      barons, escaped with honor from the bloody field of Crotona. On
      that day the scale of war was turned against the Franks by the
      valor of the Saracens. 8 These corsairs had indeed been driven by
      the Byzantine fleets from the fortresses and coasts of Italy; but
      a sense of interest was more prevalent than superstition or
      resentment, and the caliph of Egypt had transported forty
      thousand Moslems to the aid of his Christian ally. The successors
      of Basil amused themselves with the belief, that the conquest of
      Lombardy had been achieved, and was still preserved by the
      justice of their laws, the virtues of their ministers, and the
      gratitude of a people whom they had rescued from anarchy and
      oppression. A series of rebellions might dart a ray of truth into
      the palace of Constantinople; and the illusions of flattery were
      dispelled by the easy and rapid success of the Norman
      adventurers.

      his party about the same time, and Camillo Pellegrino (Script.
      Rer. Ital. tom. ii. pars i. p. 285) has nicely discerned this
      change in the style of the anonymous Chronicle. On the rational
      ground of history and language, Liutprand (p. 480) had asserted

      has accurately observed (Abrege Chronologique, tom. ii. p. 924)
      that in this age the capitanei were not captains, but only nobles
      of the first rank, the great valvassors of Italy.]

      far different character of the Greeks during the five years (A.D.
      891-896) that Leo was master of the city.]

      The revolution of human affairs had produced in Apulia and
      Calabria a melancholy contrast between the age of Pythagoras and
      the tenth century of the Christian aera. At the former period,
      the coast of Great Greece (as it was then styled) was planted
      with free and opulent cities: these cities were peopled with
      soldiers, artists, and philosophers; and the military strength of
      Tarentum; Sybaris, or Crotona, was not inferior to that of a
      powerful kingdom. At the second aera, these once flourishing
      provinces were clouded with ignorance impoverished by tyranny,
      and depopulated by Barbarian war; nor can we severely accuse the
      exaggeration of a contemporary, that a fair and ample district
      was reduced to the same desolation which had covered the earth
      after the general deluge. 9 Among the hostilities of the Arabs,
      the Franks, and the Greeks, in the southern Italy, I shall select
      two or three anecdotes expressive of their national manners. 1.
      It was the amusement of the Saracens to profane, as well as to
      pillage, the monasteries and churches. At the siege of Salerno, a
      Mussulman chief spread his couch on the communion-table, and on
      that altar sacrificed each night the virginity of a Christian
      nun. As he wrestled with a reluctant maid, a beam in the roof was
      accidentally or dexterously thrown down on his head; and the
      death of the lustful emir was imputed to the wrath of Christ,
      which was at length awakened to the defence of his faithful
      spouse. 10 2. The Saracens besieged the cities of Beneventum and
      Capua: after a vain appeal to the successors of Charlemagne, the
      Lombards implored the clemency and aid of the Greek emperor. 11 A
      fearless citizen dropped from the walls, passed the
      intrenchments, accomplished his commission, and fell into the
      hands of the Barbarians as he was returning with the welcome
      news. They commanded him to assist their enterprise, and deceive
      his countrymen, with the assurance that wealth and honors should
      be the reward of his falsehood, and that his sincerity would be
      punished with immediate death. He affected to yield, but as soon
      as he was conducted within hearing of the Christians on the
      rampart, “Friends and brethren,” he cried with a loud voice, “be
      bold and patient, maintain the city; your sovereign is informed
      of your distress, and your deliverers are at hand. I know my
      doom, and commit my wife and children to your gratitude.” The
      rage of the Arabs confirmed his evidence; and the self-devoted
      patriot was transpierced with a hundred spears. He deserves to
      live in the memory of the virtuous, but the repetition of the
      same story in ancient and modern times, may sprinkle some doubts
      on the reality of this generous deed. 12 3. The recital of a
      third incident may provoke a smile amidst the horrors of war.
      Theobald, marquis of Camerino and Spoleto, 13 supported the
      rebels of Beneventum; and his wanton cruelty was not incompatible
      in that age with the character of a hero. His captives of the
      Greek nation or party were castrated without mercy, and the
      outrage was aggravated by a cruel jest, that he wished to present
      the emperor with a supply of eunuchs, the most precious ornaments
      of the Byzantine court. The garrison of a castle had been
      defeated in a sally, and the prisoners were sentenced to the
      customary operation. But the sacrifice was disturbed by the
      intrusion of a frantic female, who, with bleeding cheeks
      dishevelled hair, and importunate clamors, compelled the marquis
      to listen to her complaint. “Is it thus,” she cried, “ye
      magnanimous heroes, that ye wage war against women, against women
      who have never injured ye, and whose only arms are the distaff
      and the loom?” Theobald denied the charge, and protested that,
      since the Amazons, he had never heard of a female war. “And how,”
      she furiously exclaimed, “can you attack us more directly, how
      can you wound us in a more vital part, than by robbing our
      husbands of what we most dearly cherish, the source of our joys,
      and the hope of our posterity? The plunder of our flocks and
      herds I have endured without a murmur, but this fatal injury,
      this irreparable loss, subdues my patience, and calls aloud on
      the justice of heaven and earth.” A general laugh applauded her
      eloquence; the savage Franks, inaccessible to pity, were moved by
      her ridiculous, yet rational despair; and with the deliverance of
      the captives, she obtained the restitution of her effects. As she
      returned in triumph to the castle, she was overtaken by a
      messenger, to inquire, in the name of Theobald, what punishment
      should be inflicted on her husband, were he again taken in arms.
      “Should such,” she answered without hesitation, “be his guilt and
      misfortune, he has eyes, and a nose, and hands, and feet. These
      are his own, and these he may deserve to forfeit by his personal
      offences. But let my lord be pleased to spare what his little
      handmaid presumes to claim as her peculiar and lawful property.”

      Italic. Script. tom. v. p. 23) and of Camillo Pellegrino, (tom.

      this story from a Ms. of Erchempert, who died at Capua only
      fifteen years after the event. But the cardinal was deceived by a
      false title, and we can only quote the anonymous Chronicle of
      Salerno, (Paralipomena, c. 110,) composed towards the end of the
      xth century, and published in the second volume of Muratori’s
      Collection. See the Dissertations of Camillo Pellegrino, tom. ii.

      the reigns of Basil and Lewis II.; yet the reduction of
      Beneventum by the Greeks is dated A.D. 891, after the decease of
      both of those princes.]

      12 (return) [ In the year 663, the same tragedy is described by
      Paul the Deacon, (de Gestis Langobard. l. v. c. 7, 8, p. 870,
      871, edit. Grot.,) under the walls of the same city of
      Beneventum. But the actors are different, and the guilt is
      imputed to the Greeks themselves, which in the Byzantine edition
      is applied to the Saracens. In the late war in Germany, M.
      D’Assas, a French officer of the regiment of Auvergne, is said to
      have devoted himself in a similar manner. His behavior is the
      more heroic, as mere silence was required by the enemy who had
      made him prisoner, (Voltaire, Siecle de Louis XV. c. 33, tom. ix.

      march or frontier) was introduced into Italy by the French

      The establishment of the Normans in the kingdoms of Naples and
      Sicily 15 is an event most romantic in its origin, and in its
      consequences most important both to Italy and the Eastern empire.
      The broken provinces of the Greeks, Lombards, and Saracens, were
      exposed to every invader, and every sea and land were invaded by
      the adventurous spirit of the Scandinavian pirates. After a long
      indulgence of rapine and slaughter, a fair and ample territory
      was accepted, occupied, and named, by the Normans of France: they
      renounced their gods for the God of the Christians; 16 and the
      dukes of Normandy acknowledged themselves the vassals of the
      successors of Charlemagne and Capet. The savage fierceness which
      they had brought from the snowy mountains of Norway was refined,
      without being corrupted, in a warmer climate; the companions of
      Rollo insensibly mingled with the natives; they imbibed the
      manners, language, 17 and gallantry, of the French nation; and in
      a martial age, the Normans might claim the palm of valor and
      glorious achievements. Of the fashionable superstitions, they
      embraced with ardor the pilgrimages of Rome, Italy, and the Holy
      Land. 171 In this active devotion, the minds and bodies were
      invigorated by exercise: danger was the incentive, novelty the
      recompense; and the prospect of the world was decorated by
      wonder, credulity, and ambitious hope. They confederated for
      their mutual defence; and the robbers of the Alps, who had been
      allured by the garb of a pilgrim, were often chastised by the arm
      of a warrior. In one of these pious visits to the cavern of Mount
      Garganus in Apulia, which had been sanctified by the apparition
      of the archangel Michael, 18 they were accosted by a stranger in
      the Greek habit, but who soon revealed himself as a rebel, a
      fugitive, and a mortal foe of the Greek empire. His name was
      Melo; a noble citizen of Bari, who, after an unsuccessful revolt,
      was compelled to seek new allies and avengers of his country. The
      bold appearance of the Normans revived his hopes and solicited
      his confidence: they listened to the complaints, and still more
      to the promises, of the patriot. The assurance of wealth
      demonstrated the justice of his cause; and they viewed, as the
      inheritance of the brave, the fruitful land which was oppressed
      by effeminate tyrants. On their return to Normandy, they kindled
      a spark of enterprise, and a small but intrepid band was freely
      associated for the deliverance of Apulia. They passed the Alps by
      separate roads, and in the disguise of pilgrims; but in the
      neighborhood of Rome they were saluted by the chief of Bari, who
      supplied the more indigent with arms and horses, and instantly
      led them to the field of action. In the first conflict, their
      valor prevailed; but in the second engagement they were
      overwhelmed by the numbers and military engines of the Greeks,
      and indignantly retreated with their faces to the enemy. 1811 The
      unfortunate Melo ended his life a suppliant at the court of
      Germany: his Norman followers, excluded from their native and
      their promised land, wandered among the hills and valleys of
      Italy, and earned their daily subsistence by the sword. To that
      formidable sword the princes of Capua, Beneventum, Salerno, and
      Naples, alternately appealed in their domestic quarrels; the
      superior spirit and discipline of the Normans gave victory to the
      side which they espoused; and their cautious policy observed the
      balance of power, lest the preponderance of any rival state
      should render their aid less important, and their service less
      profitable. Their first asylum was a strong camp in the depth of
      the marshes of Campania: but they were soon endowed by the
      liberality of the duke of Naples with a more plentiful and
      permanent seat. Eight miles from his residence, as a bulwark
      against Capua, the town of Aversa was built and fortified for
      their use; and they enjoyed as their own the corn and fruits, the
      meadows and groves, of that fertile district. The report of their
      success attracted every year new swarms of pilgrims and soldiers:
      the poor were urged by necessity; the rich were excited by hope;
      and the brave and active spirits of Normandy were impatient of
      ease and ambitious of renown. The independent standard of Aversa
      afforded shelter and encouragement to the outlaws of the
      province, to every fugitive who had escaped from the injustice or
      justice of his superiors; and these foreign associates were
      quickly assimilated in manners and language to the Gallic colony.
      The first leader of the Normans was Count Rainulf; and, in the
      origin of society, preeminence of rank is the reward and the
      proof of superior merit. 19 1911

      15 (return) [ The original monuments of the Normans in Italy are
      collected in the vth volume of Muratori; and among these we may
      distinguish the poems of William Appulus (p. 245-278) and the
      history of Galfridus (Jeffrey) Malaterra, (p. 537-607.) Both were
      natives of France, but they wrote on the spot, in the age of the
      first conquerors (before A.D. 1100,) and with the spirit of
      freemen. It is needless to recapitulate the compilers and critics

      of the emperor Henry II. the Normans, united under the command of
      Rainulf, had taken possession of Aversa, then a small castle in
      the duchy of Naples. They had been masters of it a few years when
      Pandulf IV., prince of Capua, found means to take Naples by
      surprise. Sergius, master of the soldiers, and head of the
      republic, with the principal citizens, abandoned a city in which
      he could not behold, without horror, the establishment of a
      foreign dominion he retired to Aversa; and when, with the
      assistance of the Greeks and that of the citizens faithful to
      their country, he had collected money enough to satisfy the
      rapacity of the Norman adventurers, he advanced at their head to
      attack the garrison of the prince of Capua, defeated it, and
      reentered Naples. It was then that he confirmed the Normans in
      the possession of Aversa and its territory, which he raised into
      a count’s fief, and granted the investiture to Rainulf. Hist. des
      Rep. Ital. tom. i. p. 267]

      Since the conquest of Sicily by the Arabs, the Grecian emperors
      had been anxious to regain that valuable possession; but their
      efforts, however strenuous, had been opposed by the distance and
      the sea. Their costly armaments, after a gleam of success, added
      new pages of calamity and disgrace to the Byzantine annals:
      twenty thousand of their best troops were lost in a single
      expedition; and the victorious Moslems derided the policy of a
      nation which intrusted eunuchs not only with the custody of their
      women, but with the command of their men 20 After a reign of two
      hundred years, the Saracens were ruined by their divisions. 21
      The emir disclaimed the authority of the king of Tunis; the
      people rose against the emir; the cities were usurped by the
      chiefs; each meaner rebel was independent in his village or
      castle; and the weaker of two rival brothers implored the
      friendship of the Christians. In every service of danger the
      Normans were prompt and useful; and five hundred knights, or
      warriors on horseback, were enrolled by Arduin, the agent and
      interpreter of the Greeks, under the standard of Maniaces,
      governor of Lombardy. Before their landing, the brothers were
      reconciled; the union of Sicily and Africa was restored; and the
      island was guarded to the water’s edge. The Normans led the van
      and the Arabs of Messina felt the valor of an untried foe. In a
      second action the emir of Syracuse was unhorsed and transpierced
      by the iron arm of William of Hauteville. In a third engagement,
      his intrepid companions discomfited the host of sixty thousand
      Saracens, and left the Greeks no more than the labor of the
      pursuit: a splendid victory; but of which the pen of the
      historian may divide the merit with the lance of the Normans. It
      is, however, true, that they essentially promoted the success of
      Maniaces, who reduced thirteen cities, and the greater part of
      Sicily, under the obedience of the emperor. But his military fame
      was sullied by ingratitude and tyranny. In the division of the
      spoils, the deserts of his brave auxiliaries were forgotten; and
      neither their avarice nor their pride could brook this injurious
      treatment. They complained by the mouth of their interpreter:
      their complaint was disregarded; their interpreter was scourged;
      the sufferings were his; the insult and resentment belonged to
      those whose sentiments he had delivered. Yet they dissembled till
      they had obtained, or stolen, a safe passage to the Italian
      continent: their brethren of Aversa sympathized in their
      indignation, and the province of Apulia was invaded as the
      forfeit of the debt. 22 Above twenty years after the first
      emigration, the Normans took the field with no more than seven
      hundred horse and five hundred foot; and after the recall of the
      Byzantine legions 23 from the Sicilian war, their numbers are
      magnified to the amount of threescore thousand men. Their herald
      proposed the option of battle or retreat; “of battle,” was the
      unanimous cry of the Normans; and one of their stoutest warriors,
      with a stroke of his fist, felled to the ground the horse of the
      Greek messenger. He was dismissed with a fresh horse; the insult
      was concealed from the Imperial troops; but in two successive
      battles they were more fatally instructed of the prowess of their
      adversaries. In the plains of Cannae, the Asiatics fled before
      the adventurers of France; the duke of Lombardy was made
      prisoner; the Apulians acquiesced in a new dominion; and the four
      places of Bari, Otranto, Brundusium, and Tarentum, were alone
      saved in the shipwreck of the Grecian fortunes. From this aera we
      may date the establishment of the Norman power, which soon
      eclipsed the infant colony of Aversa. Twelve counts 24 were
      chosen by the popular suffrage; and age, birth, and merit, were
      the motives of their choice. The tributes of their peculiar
      districts were appropriated to their use; and each count erected
      a fortress in the midst of his lands, and at the head of his
      vassals. In the centre of the province, the common habitation of
      Melphi was reserved as the metropolis and citadel of the
      republic; a house and separate quarter was allotted to each of
      the twelve counts: and the national concerns were regulated by
      this military senate. The first of his peers, their president and
      general, was entitled count of Apulia; and this dignity was
      conferred on William of the iron arm, who, in the language of the
      age, is styled a lion in battle, a lamb in society, and an angel
      in council. 25 The manners of his countrymen are fairly
      delineated by a contemporary and national historian. 26 “The
      Normans,” says Malaterra, “are a cunning and revengeful people;
      eloquence and dissimulation appear to be their hereditary
      qualities: they can stoop to flatter; but unless they are curbed
      by the restraint of law, they indulge the licentiousness of
      nature and passion. Their princes affect the praises of popular
      munificence; the people observe the medium, or rather blond the
      extremes, of avarice and prodigality; and in their eager thirst
      of wealth and dominion, they despise whatever they possess, and
      hope whatever they desire. Arms and horses, the luxury of dress,
      the exercises of hunting and hawking 27 are the delight of the
      Normans; but, on pressing occasions, they can endure with
      incredible patience the inclemency of every climate, and the toil
      and absence of a military life.” 28

      Chapter LVI: The Saracens, The Franks And The Normans.—Part II.

      The Normans of Apulia were seated on the verge of the two
      empires; and, according to the policy of the hour, they accepted
      the investiture of their lands, from the sovereigns of Germany or
      Constantinople. But the firmest title of these adventurers was
      the right of conquest: they neither loved nor trusted; they were
      neither trusted nor beloved: the contempt of the princes was
      mixed with fear, and the fear of the natives was mingled with
      hatred and resentment. Every object of desire, a horse, a woman,
      a garden, tempted and gratified the rapaciousness of the
      strangers; 29 and the avarice of their chiefs was only colored by
      the more specious names of ambition and glory. The twelve counts
      were sometimes joined in the league of injustice: in their
      domestic quarrels they disputed the spoils of the people: the
      virtues of William were buried in his grave; and Drogo, his
      brother and successor, was better qualified to lead the valor,
      than to restrain the violence, of his peers. Under the reign of
      Constantine Monomachus, the policy, rather than benevolence, of
      the Byzantine court, attempted to relieve Italy from this
      adherent mischief, more grievous than a flight of Barbarians; 30
      and Argyrus, the son of Melo, was invested for this purpose with
      the most lofty titles 31 and the most ample commission. The
      memory of his father might recommend him to the Normans; and he
      had already engaged their voluntary service to quell the revolt
      of Maniaces, and to avenge their own and the public injury. It
      was the design of Constantine to transplant the warlike colony
      from the Italian provinces to the Persian war; and the son of
      Melo distributed among the chiefs the gold and manufactures of
      Greece, as the first-fruits of the Imperial bounty. But his arts
      were baffled by the sense and spirit of the conquerors of Apulia:
      his gifts, or at least his proposals, were rejected; and they
      unanimously refused to relinquish their possessions and their
      hopes for the distant prospect of Asiatic fortune. After the
      means of persuasion had failed, Argyrus resolved to compel or to
      destroy: the Latin powers were solicited against the common
      enemy; and an offensive alliance was formed of the pope and the
      two emperors of the East and West. The throne of St. Peter was
      occupied by Leo the Ninth, a simple saint, 32 of a temper most
      apt to deceive himself and the world, and whose venerable
      character would consecrate with the name of piety the measures
      least compatible with the practice of religion. His humanity was
      affected by the complaints, perhaps the calumnies, of an injured
      people: the impious Normans had interrupted the payment of
      tithes; and the temporal sword might be lawfully unsheathed
      against the sacrilegious robbers, who were deaf to the censures
      of the church. As a German of noble birth and royal kindred, Leo
      had free access to the court and confidence of the emperor Henry
      the Third; and in search of arms and allies, his ardent zeal
      transported him from Apulia to Saxony, from the Elbe to the
      Tyber. During these hostile preparations, Argyrus indulged
      himself in the use of secret and guilty weapons: a crowd of
      Normans became the victims of public or private revenge; and the
      valiant Drogo was murdered in a church. But his spirit survived
      in his brother Humphrey, the third count of Apulia. The assassins
      were chastised; and the son of Melo, overthrown and wounded, was
      driven from the field, to hide his shame behind the walls of
      Bari, and to await the tardy succor of his allies.

      make it a palatine office, master of the wardrobe.]

      32 (return) [ A Life of St. Leo IX., deeply tinged with the
      passions and prejudices of the age, has been composed by Wibert,
      printed at Paris, 1615, in octavo, and since inserted in the
      Collections of the Bollandists, of Mabillon, and of Muratori. The
      public and private history of that pope is diligently treated by
      M. de St. Marc. (Abrege, tom. ii. p. 140-210, and p. 25-95,
      second column.)]

      But the power of Constantine was distracted by a Turkish war; the
      mind of Henry was feeble and irresolute; and the pope, instead of
      repassing the Alps with a German army, was accompanied only by a
      guard of seven hundred Swabians and some volunteers of Lorraine.
      In his long progress from Mantua to Beneventum, a vile and
      promiscuous multitude of Italians was enlisted under the holy
      standard: 33 the priest and the robber slept in the same tent;
      the pikes and crosses were intermingled in the front; and the
      martial saint repeated the lessons of his youth in the order of
      march, of encampment, and of combat. The Normans of Apulia could
      muster in the field no more than three thousand horse, with a
      handful of infantry: the defection of the natives intercepted
      their provisions and retreat; and their spirit, incapable of
      fear, was chilled for a moment by superstitious awe. On the
      hostile approach of Leo, they knelt without disgrace or
      reluctance before their spiritual father. But the pope was
      inexorable; his lofty Germans affected to deride the diminutive
      stature of their adversaries; and the Normans were informed that
      death or exile was their only alternative. Flight they disdained,
      and, as many of them had been three days without tasting food,
      they embraced the assurance of a more easy and honorable death.
      They climbed the hill of Civitella, descended into the plain, and
      charged in three divisions the army of the pope. On the left, and
      in the centre, Richard count of Aversa, and Robert the famous
      Guiscard, attacked, broke, routed, and pursued the Italian
      multitudes, who fought without discipline, and fled without
      shame. A harder trial was reserved for the valor of Count
      Humphrey, who led the cavalry of the right wing. The Germans 34
      have been described as unskillful in the management of the horse
      and the lance, but on foot they formed a strong and impenetrable
      phalanx; and neither man, nor steed, nor armor, could resist the
      weight of their long and two-handed swords. After a severe
      conflict, they were encompassed by the squadrons returning from
      the pursuit; and died in the ranks with the esteem of their foes,
      and the satisfaction of revenge. The gates of Civitella were shut
      against the flying pope, and he was overtaken by the pious
      conquerors, who kissed his feet, to implore his blessing and the
      absolution of their sinful victory. The soldiers beheld in their
      enemy and captive the vicar of Christ; and, though we may suppose
      the policy of the chiefs, it is probable that they were infected
      by the popular superstition. In the calm of retirement, the
      well-meaning pope deplored the effusion of Christian blood, which
      must be imputed to his account: he felt, that he had been the
      author of sin and scandal; and as his undertaking had failed, the
      indecency of his military character was universally condemned. 35
      With these dispositions, he listened to the offers of a
      beneficial treaty; deserted an alliance which he had preached as
      the cause of God; and ratified the past and future conquests of
      the Normans. By whatever hands they had been usurped, the
      provinces of Apulia and Calabria were a part of the donation of
      Constantine and the patrimony of St. Peter: the grant and the
      acceptance confirmed the mutual claims of the pontiff and the
      adventurers. They promised to support each other with spiritual
      and temporal arms; a tribute or quitrent of twelve pence was
      afterwards stipulated for every ploughland; and since this
      memorable transaction, the kingdom of Naples has remained above
      seven hundred years a fief of the Holy See. 36

      an empty distinction of “Ecclesia Romana non dedit, sed accepit,”
      and shrinks from an honest but dangerous confession of the
      truth.]

      The pedigree of Robert of Guiscard 37 is variously deduced from
      the peasants and the dukes of Normandy: from the peasants, by the
      pride and ignorance of a Grecian princess; 38 from the dukes, by
      the ignorance and flattery of the Italian subjects. 39 His
      genuine descent may be ascribed to the second or middle order of
      private nobility. 40 He sprang from a race of valvassors or
      bannerets, of the diocese of Coutances, in the Lower Normandy:
      the castle of Hauteville was their honorable seat: his father
      Tancred was conspicuous in the court and army of the duke; and
      his military service was furnished by ten soldiers or knights.
      Two marriages, of a rank not unworthy of his own, made him the
      father of twelve sons, who were educated at home by the impartial
      tenderness of his second wife. But a narrow patrimony was
      insufficient for this numerous and daring progeny; they saw
      around the neighborhood the mischiefs of poverty and discord, and
      resolved to seek in foreign wars a more glorious inheritance. Two
      only remained to perpetuate the race, and cherish their father’s
      age: their ten brothers, as they successfully attained the vigor
      of manhood, departed from the castle, passed the Alps, and joined
      the Apulian camp of the Normans. The elder were prompted by
      native spirit; their success encouraged their younger brethren,
      and the three first in seniority, William, Drogo, and Humphrey,
      deserved to be the chiefs of their nation and the founders of the
      new republic. Robert was the eldest of the seven sons of the
      second marriage; and even the reluctant praise of his foes has
      endowed him with the heroic qualities of a soldier and a
      statesman. His lofty stature surpassed the tallest of his army:
      his limbs were cast in the true proportion of strength and
      gracefulness; and to the decline of life, he maintained the
      patient vigor of health and the commanding dignity of his form.
      His complexion was ruddy, his shoulders were broad, his hair and
      beard were long and of a flaxen color, his eyes sparkled with
      fire, and his voice, like that of Achilles, could impress
      obedience and terror amidst the tumult of battle. In the ruder
      ages of chivalry, such qualifications are not below the notice of
      the poet or historians: they may observe that Robert, at once,
      and with equal dexterity, could wield in the right hand his
      sword, his lance in the left; that in the battle of Civitella he
      was thrice unhorsed; and that in the close of that memorable day
      he was adjudged to have borne away the prize of valor from the
      warriors of the two armies. 41 His boundless ambition was founded
      on the consciousness of superior worth: in the pursuit of
      greatness, he was never arrested by the scruples of justice, and
      seldom moved by the feelings of humanity: though not insensible
      of fame, the choice of open or clandestine means was determined
      only by his present advantage. The surname of Guiscard 42 was
      applied to this master of political wisdom, which is too often
      confounded with the practice of dissimulation and deceit; and
      Robert is praised by the Apulian poet for excelling the cunning
      of Ulysses and the eloquence of Cicero. Yet these arts were
      disguised by an appearance of military frankness: in his highest
      fortune, he was accessible and courteous to his fellow-soldiers;
      and while he indulged the prejudices of his new subjects, he
      affected in his dress and manners to maintain the ancient fashion
      of his country. He grasped with a rapacious, that he might
      distribute with a liberal, hand: his primitive indigence had
      taught the habits of frugality; the gain of a merchant was not
      below his attention; and his prisoners were tortured with slow
      and unfeeling cruelty, to force a discovery of their secret
      treasure. According to the Greeks, he departed from Normandy with
      only five followers on horseback and thirty on foot; yet even
      this allowance appears too bountiful: the sixth son of Tancred of
      Hauteville passed the Alps as a pilgrim; and his first military
      band was levied among the adventurers of Italy. His brothers and
      countrymen had divided the fertile lands of Apulia; but they
      guarded their shares with the jealousy of avarice; the aspiring
      youth was driven forwards to the mountains of Calabria, and in
      his first exploits against the Greeks and the natives, it is not
      easy to discriminate the hero from the robber. To surprise a
      castle or a convent, to ensnare a wealthy citizen, to plunder the
      adjacent villages for necessary food, were the obscure labors
      which formed and exercised the powers of his mind and body. The
      volunteers of Normandy adhered to his standard; and, under his
      command, the peasants of Calabria assumed the name and character
      of Normans.

      42 (return) [ The Norman writers and editors most conversant with
      their own idiom interpret Guiscard or Wiscard, by Callidus, a
      cunning man. The root (wise) is familiar to our ear; and in the
      old word Wiseacre, I can discern something of a similar sense and
      termination. It is no bad translation of the surname and
      character of Robert.]

      As the genius of Robert expanded with his fortune, he awakened
      the jealousy of his elder brother, by whom, in a transient
      quarrel, his life was threatened and his liberty restrained.
      After the death of Humphrey, the tender age of his sons excluded
      them from the command; they were reduced to a private estate, by
      the ambition of their guardian and uncle; and Guiscard was
      exalted on a buckler, and saluted count of Apulia and general of
      the republic. With an increase of authority and of force, he
      resumed the conquest of Calabria, and soon aspired to a rank that
      should raise him forever above the heads of his equals.

      By some acts of rapine or sacrilege, he had incurred a papal
      excommunication; but Nicholas the Second was easily persuaded
      that the divisions of friends could terminate only in their
      mutual prejudice; that the Normans were the faithful champions of
      the Holy See; and it was safer to trust the alliance of a prince
      than the caprice of an aristocracy. A synod of one hundred
      bishops was convened at Melphi; and the count interrupted an
      important enterprise to guard the person and execute the decrees
      of the Roman pontiff. His gratitude and policy conferred on
      Robert and his posterity the ducal title, 43 with the investiture
      of Apulia, Calabria, and all the lands, both in Italy and Sicily,
      which his sword could rescue from the schismatic Greeks and the
      unbelieving Saracens. 44 This apostolic sanction might justify
      his arms; but the obedience of a free and victorious people could
      not be transferred without their consent; and Guiscard dissembled
      his elevation till the ensuing campaign had been illustrated by
      the conquest of Consenza and Reggio. In the hour of triumph, he
      assembled his troops, and solicited the Normans to confirm by
      their suffrage the judgment of the vicar of Christ: the soldiers
      hailed with joyful acclamations their valiant duke; and the
      counts, his former equals, pronounced the oath of fidelity with
      hollow smiles and secret indignation. After this inauguration,
      Robert styled himself, “By the grace of God and St. Peter, duke
      of Apulia, Calabria, and hereafter of Sicily;” and it was the
      labor of twenty years to deserve and realize these lofty
      appellations. Such sardy progress, in a narrow space, may seem
      unworthy of the abilities of the chief and the spirit of the
      nation; but the Normans were few in number; their resources were
      scanty; their service was voluntary and precarious. The bravest
      designs of the duke were sometimes opposed by the free voice of
      his parliament of barons: the twelve counts of popular election
      conspired against his authority; and against their perfidious
      uncle, the sons of Humphrey demanded justice and revenge. By his
      policy and vigor, Guiscard discovered their plots, suppressed
      their rebellions, and punished the guilty with death or exile:
      but in these domestic feuds, his years, and the national
      strength, were unprofitably consumed. After the defeat of his
      foreign enemies, the Greeks, Lombards, and Saracens, their broken
      forces retreated to the strong and populous cities of the
      sea-coast. They excelled in the arts of fortification and
      defence; the Normans were accustomed to serve on horseback in the
      field, and their rude attempts could only succeed by the efforts
      of persevering courage. The resistance of Salerno was maintained
      above eight months; the siege or blockade of Bari lasted near
      four years. In these actions the Norman duke was the foremost in
      every danger; in every fatigue the last and most patient. As he
      pressed the citadel of Salerno, a huge stone from the rampart
      shattered one of his military engines; and by a splinter he was
      wounded in the breast. Before the gates of Bari, he lodged in a
      miserable hut or barrack, composed of dry branches, and thatched
      with straw; a perilous station, on all sides open to the
      inclemency of the winter and the spears of the enemy. 45

      century has been printed by Muratori, (Antiquit. Medii Aevi, tom.
      v. p. 851-908;) and the names of Vatican and Cardinal awaken the
      suspicions of a Protestant, and even of a philosopher.]

      45 (return) [ Read the life of Guiscard in the second and third
      books of the Apulian, the first and second books of Malaterra.]

      The Italian conquests of Robert correspond with the limits of the
      present kingdom of Naples; and the countries united by his arms
      have not been dissevered by the revolutions of seven hundred
      years. 46 The monarchy has been composed of the Greek provinces
      of Calabria and Apulia, of the Lombard principality of Salerno,
      the republic of Amalphi, and the inland dependencies of the large
      and ancient duchy of Beneventum. Three districts only were
      exempted from the common law of subjection; the first forever,
      the two last till the middle of the succeeding century. The city
      and immediate territory of Benevento had been transferred, by
      gift or exchange, from the German emperor to the Roman pontiff;
      and although this holy land was sometimes invaded, the name of
      St. Peter was finally more potent than the sword of the Normans.
      Their first colony of Aversa subdued and held the state of Capua;
      and her princes were reduced to beg their bread before the palace
      of their fathers. The dukes of Naples, the present metropolis,
      maintained the popular freedom, under the shadow of the Byzantine
      empire. Among the new acquisitions of Guiscard, the science of
      Salerno, 47 and the trade of Amalphi, 48 may detain for a moment
      the curiosity of the reader. I. Of the learned faculties,
      jurisprudence implies the previous establishment of laws and
      property; and theology may perhaps be superseded by the full
      light of religion and reason. But the savage and the sage must
      alike implore the assistance of physic; and, if our diseases are
      inflamed by luxury, the mischiefs of blows and wounds would be
      more frequent in the ruder ages of society. The treasures of
      Grecian medicine had been communicated to the Arabian colonies of
      Africa, Spain, and Sicily; and in the intercourse of peace and
      war, a spark of knowledge had been kindled and cherished at
      Salerno, an illustrious city, in which the men were honest and
      the women beautiful. 49 A school, the first that arose in the
      darkness of Europe, was consecrated to the healing art: the
      conscience of monks and bishops was reconciled to that salutary
      and lucrative profession; and a crowd of patients, of the most
      eminent rank, and most distant climates, invited or visited the
      physicians of Salerno. They were protected by the Norman
      conquerors; and Guiscard, though bred in arms, could discern the
      merit and value of a philosopher. After a pilgrimage of
      thirty-nine years, Constantine, an African Christian, returned
      from Bagdad, a master of the language and learning of the
      Arabians; and Salerno was enriched by the practice, the lessons,
      and the writings of the pupil of Avicenna. The school of medicine
      has long slept in the name of a university; but her precepts are
      abridged in a string of aphorisms, bound together in the Leonine
      verses, or Latin rhymes, of the twelfth century. 50 II. Seven
      miles to the west of Salerno, and thirty to the south of Naples,
      the obscure town of Amalphi displayed the power and rewards of
      industry. The land, however fertile, was of narrow extent; but
      the sea was accessible and open: the inhabitants first assumed
      the office of supplying the western world with the manufactures
      and productions of the East; and this useful traffic was the
      source of their opulence and freedom. The government was popular,
      under the administration of a duke and the supremacy of the Greek
      emperor. Fifty thousand citizens were numbered in the walls of
      Amalphi; nor was any city more abundantly provided with gold,
      silver, and the objects of precious luxury. The mariners who
      swarmed in her port, excelled in the theory and practice of
      navigation and astronomy: and the discovery of the compass, which
      has opened the globe, is owing to their ingenuity or good
      fortune. Their trade was extended to the coasts, or at least to
      the commodities, of Africa, Arabia, and India: and their
      settlements in Constantinople, Antioch, Jerusalem, and
      Alexandria, acquired the privileges of independent colonies. 51
      After three hundred years of prosperity, Amalphi was oppressed by
      the arms of the Normans, and sacked by the jealousy of Pisa; but
      the poverty of one thousand 5111 fisherman is yet dignified by
      the remains of an arsenal, a cathedral, and the palaces of royal
      merchants.

      Chapter LVI: The Saracens, The Franks And The Normans.—Part III.

      Roger, the twelfth and last of the sons of Tancred, had been long
      detained in Normandy by his own and his father’s age. He accepted
      the welcome summons; hastened to the Apulian camp; and deserved
      at first the esteem, and afterwards the envy, of his elder
      brother. Their valor and ambition were equal; but the youth, the
      beauty, the elegant manners, of Roger engaged the disinterested
      love of the soldiers and people. So scanty was his allowance for
      himself and forty followers, that he descended from conquest to
      robbery, and from robbery to domestic theft; and so loose were
      the notions of property, that, by his own historian, at his
      special command, he is accused of stealing horses from a stable
      at Melphi. 52 His spirit emerged from poverty and disgrace: from
      these base practices he rose to the merit and glory of a holy
      war; and the invasion of Sicily was seconded by the zeal and
      policy of his brother Guiscard. After the retreat of the Greeks,
      the idolaters, a most audacious reproach of the Catholics, had
      retrieved their losses and possessions; but the deliverance of
      the island, so vainly undertaken by the forces of the Eastern
      empire, was achieved by a small and private band of adventurers.
      53 In the first attempt, Roger braved, in an open boat, the real
      and fabulous dangers of Scylla and Charybdis; landed with only
      sixty soldiers on a hostile shore; drove the Saracens to the
      gates of Messina and safely returned with the spoils of the
      adjacent country. In the fortress of Trani, his active and
      patient courage were equally conspicuous. In his old age he
      related with pleasure, that, by the distress of the siege,
      himself, and the countess his wife, had been reduced to a single
      cloak or mantle, which they wore alternately; that in a sally his
      horse had been slain, and he was dragged away by the Saracens;
      but that he owed his rescue to his good sword, and had retreated
      with his saddle on his back, lest the meanest trophy might be
      left in the hands of the miscreants. In the siege of Trani, three
      hundred Normans withstood and repulsed the forces of the island.
      In the field of Ceramio, fifty thousand horse and foot were
      overthrown by one hundred and thirty-six Christian soldiers,
      without reckoning St. George, who fought on horseback in the
      foremost ranks. The captive banners, with four camels, were
      reserved for the successor of St. Peter; and had these barbaric
      spoils been exposed, not in the Vatican, but in the Capitol, they
      might have revived the memory of the Punic triumphs. These
      insufficient numbers of the Normans most probably denote their
      knights, the soldiers of honorable and equestrian rank, each of
      whom was attended by five or six followers in the field; 54 yet,
      with the aid of this interpretation, and after every fair
      allowance on the side of valor, arms, and reputation, the
      discomfiture of so many myriads will reduce the prudent reader to
      the alternative of a miracle or a fable. The Arabs of Sicily
      derived a frequent and powerful succor from their countrymen of
      Africa: in the siege of Palermo, the Norman cavalry was assisted
      by the galleys of Pisa; and, in the hour of action, the envy of
      the two brothers was sublimed to a generous and invincible
      emulation. After a war of thirty years, 55 Roger, with the title
      of great count, obtained the sovereignty of the largest and most
      fruitful island of the Mediterranean; and his administration
      displays a liberal and enlightened mind, above the limits of his
      age and education. The Moslems were maintained in the free
      enjoyment of their religion and property: 56 a philosopher and
      physician of Mazara, of the race of Mahomet, harangued the
      conqueror, and was invited to court; his geography of the seven
      climates was translated into Latin; and Roger, after a diligent
      perusal, preferred the work of the Arabian to the writings of the
      Grecian Ptolemy. 57 A remnant of Christian natives had promoted
      the success of the Normans: they were rewarded by the triumph of
      the cross. The island was restored to the jurisdiction of the
      Roman pontiff; new bishops were planted in the principal cities;
      and the clergy was satisfied by a liberal endowment of churches
      and monasteries. Yet the Catholic hero asserted the rights of the
      civil magistrate. Instead of resigning the investiture of
      benefices, he dexterously applied to his own profit the papal
      claims: the supremacy of the crown was secured and enlarged, by
      the singular bull, which declares the princes of Sicily
      hereditary and perpetual legates of the Holy See. 58

      with the diligence of a Sicilian lawyer.]

      To Robert Guiscard, the conquest of Sicily was more glorious than
      beneficial: the possession of Apulia and Calabria was inadequate
      to his ambition; and he resolved to embrace or create the first
      occasion of invading, perhaps of subduing, the Roman empire of
      the East. 59 From his first wife, the partner of his humble
      fortune, he had been divorced under the pretence of
      consanguinity; and her son Bohemond was destined to imitate,
      rather than to succeed, his illustrious father. The second wife
      of Guiscard was the daughter of the princes of Salerno; the
      Lombards acquiesced in the lineal succession of their son Roger;
      their five daughters were given in honorable nuptials, 60 and one
      of them was betrothed, in a tender age, to Constantine, a
      beautiful youth, the son and heir of the emperor Michael. 61 But
      the throne of Constantinople was shaken by a revolution: the
      Imperial family of Ducas was confined to the palace or the
      cloister; and Robert deplored, and resented, the disgrace of his
      daughter and the expulsion of his ally. A Greek, who styled
      himself the father of Constantine, soon appeared at Salerno, and
      related the adventures of his fall and flight. That unfortunate
      friend was acknowledged by the duke, and adorned with the pomp
      and titles of Imperial dignity: in his triumphal progress through
      Apulia and Calabria, Michael 62 was saluted with the tears and
      acclamations of the people; and Pope Gregory the Seventh exhorted
      the bishops to preach, and the Catholics to fight, in the pious
      work of his restoration. His conversations with Robert were
      frequent and familiar; and their mutual promises were justified
      by the valor of the Normans and the treasures of the East. Yet
      this Michael, by the confession of the Greeks and Latins, was a
      pageant and an impostor; a monk who had fled from his convent, or
      a domestic who had served in the palace. The fraud had been
      contrived by the subtle Guiscard; and he trusted, that after this
      pretender had given a decent color to his arms, he would sink, at
      the nod of the conqueror, into his primitive obscurity. But
      victory was the only argument that could determine the belief of
      the Greeks; and the ardor of the Latins was much inferior to
      their credulity: the Norman veterans wished to enjoy the harvest
      of their toils, and the unwarlike Italians trembled at the known
      and unknown dangers of a transmarine expedition. In his new
      levies, Robert exerted the influence of gifts and promises, the
      terrors of civil and ecclesiastical authority; and some acts of
      violence might justify the reproach, that age and infancy were
      pressed without distinction into the service of their unrelenting
      prince. After two years’ incessant preparations the land and
      naval forces were assembled at Otranto, at the heel, or extreme
      promontory, of Italy; and Robert was accompanied by his wife, who
      fought by his side, his son Bohemond, and the representative of
      the emperor Michael. Thirteen hundred knights 63 of Norman race
      or discipline, formed the sinews of the army, which might be
      swelled to thirty thousand 64 followers of every denomination.
      The men, the horses, the arms, the engines, the wooden towers,
      covered with raw hides, were embarked on board one hundred and
      fifty vessels: the transports had been built in the ports of
      Italy, and the galleys were supplied by the alliance of the
      republic of Ragusa.

      At the mouth of the Adriatic Gulf, the shores of Italy and Epirus
      incline towards each other. The space between Brundusium and
      Durazzo, the Roman passage, is no more than one hundred miles; 65
      at the last station of Otranto, it is contracted to fifty; 66 and
      this narrow distance had suggested to Pyrrhus and Pompey the
      sublime or extravagant idea of a bridge. Before the general
      embarkation, the Norman duke despatched Bohemond with fifteen
      galleys to seize or threaten the Isle of Corfu, to survey the
      opposite coast, and to secure a harbor in the neighborhood of
      Vallona for the landing of the troops. They passed and landed
      without perceiving an enemy; and this successful experiment
      displayed the neglect and decay of the naval power of the Greeks.
      The islands of Epirus and the maritime towns were subdued by the
      arms or the name of Robert, who led his fleet and army from Corfu
      (I use the modern appellation) to the siege of Durazzo. That
      city, the western key of the empire, was guarded by ancient
      renown, and recent fortifications, by George Palaeologus, a
      patrician, victorious in the Oriental wars, and a numerous
      garrison of Albanians and Macedonians, who, in every age, have
      maintained the character of soldiers. In the prosecution of his
      enterprise, the courage of Guiscard was assailed by every form of
      danger and mischance. In the most propitious season of the year,
      as his fleet passed along the coast, a storm of wind and snow
      unexpectedly arose: the Adriatic was swelled by the raging blast
      of the south, and a new shipwreck confirmed the old infamy of the
      Acroceraunian rocks. 67 The sails, the masts, and the oars, were
      shattered or torn away; the sea and shore were covered with the
      fragments of vessels, with arms and dead bodies; and the greatest
      part of the provisions were either drowned or damaged. The ducal
      galley was laboriously rescued from the waves, and Robert halted
      seven days on the adjacent cape, to collect the relics of his
      loss, and revive the drooping spirits of his soldiers. The
      Normans were no longer the bold and experienced mariners who had
      explored the ocean from Greenland to Mount Atlas, and who smiled
      at the petty dangers of the Mediterranean. They had wept during
      the tempest; they were alarmed by the hostile approach of the
      Venetians, who had been solicited by the prayers and promises of
      the Byzantine court. The first day’s action was not
      disadvantageous to Bohemond, a beardless youth, 68 who led the
      naval powers of his father. All night the galleys of the republic
      lay on their anchors in the form of a crescent; and the victory
      of the second day was decided by the dexterity of their
      evolutions, the station of their archers, the weight of their
      javelins, and the borrowed aid of the Greek fire. The Apulian and
      Ragusian vessels fled to the shore, several were cut from their
      cables, and dragged away by the conqueror; and a sally from the
      town carried slaughter and dismay to the tents of the Norman
      duke. A seasonable relief was poured into Durazzo, and as soon as
      the besiegers had lost the command of the sea, the islands and
      maritime towns withdrew from the camp the supply of tribute and
      provision. That camp was soon afflicted with a pestilential
      disease; five hundred knights perished by an inglorious death;
      and the list of burials (if all could obtain a decent burial)
      amounted to ten thousand persons. Under these calamities, the
      mind of Guiscard alone was firm and invincible; and while he
      collected new forces from Apulia and Sicily, he battered, or
      scaled, or sapped, the walls of Durazzo. But his industry and
      valor were encountered by equal valor and more perfect industry.
      A movable turret, of a size and capacity to contain five hundred
      soldiers, had been rolled forwards to the foot of the rampart:
      but the descent of the door or drawbridge was checked by an
      enormous beam, and the wooden structure was constantly consumed
      by artificial flames.

      Alexiad. p. 283.)]

      While the Roman empire was attacked by the Turks in the East,
      east, and the Normans in the West, the aged successor of Michael
      surrendered the sceptre to the hands of Alexius, an illustrious
      captain, and the founder of the Comnenian dynasty. The princess
      Anne, his daughter and historian, observes, in her affected
      style, that even Hercules was unequal to a double combat; and, on
      this principle, she approves a hasty peace with the Turks, which
      allowed her father to undertake in person the relief of Durazzo.
      On his accession, Alexius found the camp without soldiers, and
      the treasury without money; yet such were the vigor and activity
      of his measures, that in six months he assembled an army of
      seventy thousand men, 69 and performed a march of five hundred
      miles. His troops were levied in Europe and Asia, from
      Peloponnesus to the Black Sea; his majesty was displayed in the
      silver arms and rich trappings of the companies of Horse-guards;
      and the emperor was attended by a train of nobles and princes,
      some of whom, in rapid succession, had been clothed with the
      purple, and were indulged by the lenity of the times in a life of
      affluence and dignity. Their youthful ardor might animate the
      multitude; but their love of pleasure and contempt of
      subordination were pregnant with disorder and mischief; and their
      importunate clamors for speedy and decisive action disconcerted
      the prudence of Alexius, who might have surrounded and starved
      the besieging army. The enumeration of provinces recalls a sad
      comparison of the past and present limits of the Roman world: the
      raw levies were drawn together in haste and terror; and the
      garrisons of Anatolia, or Asia Minor, had been purchased by the
      evacuation of the cities which were immediately occupied by the
      Turks. The strength of the Greek army consisted in the
      Varangians, the Scandinavian guards, whose numbers were recently
      augmented by a colony of exiles and volunteers from the British
      Island of Thule. Under the yoke of the Norman conqueror, the
      Danes and English were oppressed and united; a band of
      adventurous youths resolved to desert a land of slavery; the sea
      was open to their escape; and, in their long pilgrimage, they
      visited every coast that afforded any hope of liberty and
      revenge. They were entertained in the service of the Greek
      emperor; and their first station was in a new city on the Asiatic
      shore: but Alexius soon recalled them to the defence of his
      person and palace; and bequeathed to his successors the
      inheritance of their faith and valor. 70 The name of a Norman
      invader revived the memory of their wrongs: they marched with
      alacrity against the national foe, and panted to regain in Epirus
      the glory which they had lost in the battle of Hastings. The
      Varangians were supported by some companies of Franks or Latins;
      and the rebels, who had fled to Constantinople from the tyranny
      of Guiscard, were eager to signalize their zeal and gratify their
      revenge. In this emergency, the emperor had not disdained the
      impure aid of the Paulicians or Manichaeans of Thrace and
      Bulgaria; and these heretics united with the patience of
      martyrdom the spirit and discipline of active valor. 71 The
      treaty with the sultan had procured a supply of some thousand
      Turks; and the arrows of the Scythian horse were opposed to the
      lances of the Norman cavalry. On the report and distant prospect
      of these formidable numbers, Robert assembled a council of his
      principal officers. “You behold,” said he, “your danger: it is
      urgent and inevitable. The hills are covered with arms and
      standards; and the emperor of the Greeks is accustomed to wars
      and triumphs. Obedience and union are our only safety; and I am
      ready to yield the command to a more worthy leader.” The vote and
      acclamation even of his secret enemies, assured him, in that
      perilous moment, of their esteem and confidence; and the duke
      thus continued: “Let us trust in the rewards of victory, and
      deprive cowardice of the means of escape. Let us burn our vessels
      and our baggage, and give battle on this spot, as if it were the
      place of our nativity and our burial.” The resolution was
      unanimously approved; and, without confining himself to his
      lines, Guiscard awaited in battle-array the nearer approach of
      the enemy. His rear was covered by a small river; his right wing
      extended to the sea; his left to the hills: nor was he conscious,
      perhaps, that on the same ground Caesar and Pompey had formerly
      disputed the empire of the world. 72

      Quintus Icilius (M. Guichard) did not live to analyze these
      operations, as he has done the campaigns of Africa and Spain.]

      Against the advice of his wisest captains, Alexius resolved to
      risk the event of a general action, and exhorted the garrison of
      Durazzo to assist their own deliverance by a well-timed sally
      from the town. He marched in two columns to surprise the Normans
      before daybreak on two different sides: his light cavalry was
      scattered over the plain; the archers formed the second line; and
      the Varangians claimed the honors of the vanguard. In the first
      onset, the battle-axes of the strangers made a deep and bloody
      impression on the army of Guiscard, which was now reduced to
      fifteen thousand men. The Lombards and Calabrians ignominiously
      turned their backs; they fled towards the river and the sea; but
      the bridge had been broken down to check the sally of the
      garrison, and the coast was lined with the Venetian galleys, who
      played their engines among the disorderly throng. On the verge of
      ruin, they were saved by the spirit and conduct of their chiefs.
      Gaita, the wife of Robert, is painted by the Greeks as a warlike
      Amazon, a second Pallas; less skilful in arts, but not less
      terrible in arms, than the Athenian goddess: 73 though wounded by
      an arrow, she stood her ground, and strove, by her exhortation
      and example, to rally the flying troops. 74 Her female voice was
      seconded by the more powerful voice and arm of the Norman duke,
      as calm in action as he was magnanimous in council: “Whither,” he
      cried aloud, “whither do ye fly? Your enemy is implacable; and
      death is less grievous than servitude.” The moment was decisive:
      as the Varangians advanced before the line, they discovered the
      nakedness of their flanks: the main battle of the duke, of eight
      hundred knights, stood firm and entire; they couched their
      lances, and the Greeks bore the furious and irresistible shock of
      the French cavalry. 75 Alexius was not deficient in the duties of
      a soldier or a general; but he no sooner beheld the slaughter of
      the Varangians, and the flight of the Turks, than he despised his
      subjects, and despaired of his fortune. The princess Anne, who
      drops a tear on this melancholy event, is reduced to praise the
      strength and swiftness of her father’s horse, and his vigorous
      struggle when he was almost overthrown by the stroke of a lance,
      which had shivered the Imperial helmet. His desperate valor broke
      through a squadron of Franks who opposed his flight; and after
      wandering two days and as many nights in the mountains, he found
      some repose, of body, though not of mind, in the walls of
      Lychnidus. The victorious Robert reproached the tardy and feeble
      pursuit which had suffered the escape of so illustrious a prize:
      but he consoled his disappointment by the trophies and standards
      of the field, the wealth and luxury of the Byzantine camp, and
      the glory of defeating an army five times more numerous than his
      own. A multitude of Italians had been the victims of their own
      fears; but only thirty of his knights were slain in this
      memorable day. In the Roman host, the loss of Greeks, Turks, and
      English, amounted to five or six thousand: 76 the plain of
      Durazzo was stained with noble and royal blood; and the end of
      the impostor Michael was more honorable than his life.

      It is more than probable that Guiscard was not afflicted by the
      loss of a costly pageant, which had merited only the contempt and
      derision of the Greeks. After their defeat, they still persevered
      in the defence of Durazzo; and a Venetian commander supplied the
      place of George Palaeologus, who had been imprudently called away
      from his station. The tents of the besiegers were converted into
      barracks, to sustain the inclemency of the winter; and in answer
      to the defiance of the garrison, Robert insinuated, that his
      patience was at least equal to their obstinacy. 77 Perhaps he
      already trusted to his secret correspondence with a Venetian
      noble, who sold the city for a rich and honorable marriage. At
      the dead of night, several rope-ladders were dropped from the
      walls; the light Calabrians ascended in silence; and the Greeks
      were awakened by the name and trumpets of the conqueror. Yet they
      defended the streets three days against an enemy already master
      of the rampart; and near seven months elapsed between the first
      investment and the final surrender of the place. From Durazzo,
      the Norman duke advanced into the heart of Epirus or Albania;
      traversed the first mountains of Thessaly; surprised three
      hundred English in the city of Castoria; approached Thessalonica;
      and made Constantinople tremble. A more pressing duty suspended
      the prosecution of his ambitious designs. By shipwreck,
      pestilence, and the sword, his army was reduced to a third of the
      original numbers; and instead of being recruited from Italy, he
      was informed, by plaintive epistles, of the mischiefs and dangers
      which had been produced by his absence: the revolt of the cities
      and barons of Apulia; the distress of the pope; and the approach
      or invasion of Henry king of Germany. Highly presuming that his
      person was sufficient for the public safety, he repassed the sea
      in a single brigantine, and left the remains of the army under
      the command of his son and the Norman counts, exhorting Bohemond
      to respect the freedom of his peers, and the counts to obey the
      authority of their leader. The son of Guiscard trod in the
      footsteps of his father; and the two destroyers are compared, by
      the Greeks, to the caterpillar and the locust, the last of whom
      devours whatever has escaped the teeth of the former. 78 After
      winning two battles against the emperor, he descended into the
      plain of Thessaly, and besieged Larissa, the fabulous realm of
      Achilles, 79 which contained the treasure and magazines of the
      Byzantine camp. Yet a just praise must not be refused to the
      fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who bravely struggled with the
      calamities of the times. In the poverty of the state, he presumed
      to borrow the superfluous ornaments of the churches: the
      desertion of the Manichaeans was supplied by some tribes of
      Moldavia: a reenforcement of seven thousand Turks replaced and
      revenged the loss of their brethren; and the Greek soldiers were
      exercised to ride, to draw the bow, and to the daily practice of
      ambuscades and evolutions. Alexius had been taught by experience,
      that the formidable cavalry of the Franks on foot was unfit for
      action, and almost incapable of motion; 80 his archers were
      directed to aim their arrows at the horse rather than the man;
      and a variety of spikes and snares were scattered over the ground
      on which he might expect an attack. In the neighborhood of
      Larissa the events of war were protracted and balanced. The
      courage of Bohemond was always conspicuous, and often successful;
      but his camp was pillaged by a stratagem of the Greeks; the city
      was impregnable; and the venal or discontented counts deserted
      his standard, betrayed their trusts, and enlisted in the service
      of the emperor. Alexius returned to Constantinople with the
      advantage, rather than the honor, of victory. After evacuating
      the conquests which he could no longer defend, the son of
      Guiscard embarked for Italy, and was embraced by a father who
      esteemed his merit, and sympathized in his misfortune.

      Chapter LVI: The Saracens, The Franks And The Normans.—Part IV.

      Of the Latin princes, the allies of Alexius and enemies of
      Robert, the most prompt and powerful was Henry the Third or
      Fourth, king of Germany and Italy, and future emperor of the
      West. The epistle of the Greek monarch 81 to his brother is
      filled with the warmest professions of friendship, and the most
      lively desire of strengthening their alliance by every public and
      private tie. He congratulates Henry on his success in a just and
      pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own empire is
      disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the Norman Robert. The
      lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age—a radiated
      crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a
      case of relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase
      of crystal, a vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of
      Mecca, and one hundred pieces of purple. To these he added a more
      solid present, of one hundred and forty-four thousand Byzantines
      of gold, with a further assurance of two hundred and sixteen
      thousand, so soon as Henry should have entered in arms the
      Apulian territories, and confirmed by an oath the league against
      the common enemy. The German, 82 who was already in Lombardy at
      the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers,
      and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound
      of the battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name,
      in the hasty return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the
      Grecian bribe. Henry was the severe adversary of the Normans, the
      allies and vassals of Gregory the Seventh, his implacable foe.
      The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been recently
      kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest: 83 the
      king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had seated a
      rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.
      After the defeat and death of his Swabian rebel, Henry descended
      into Italy, to assume the Imperial crown, and to drive from the
      Vatican the tyrant of the church. 84 But the Roman people adhered
      to the cause of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by
      supplies of men and money from Apulia; and the city was thrice
      ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany. In the fourth year
      he corrupted, as it is said, with Byzantine gold, the nobles of
      Rome, whose estates and castles had been ruined by the war. The
      gates, the bridges, and fifty hostages, were delivered into his
      hands: the anti-pope, Clement the Third, was consecrated in the
      Lateran: the grateful pontiff crowned his protector in the
      Vatican; and the emperor Henry fixed his residence in the
      Capitol, as the lawful successor of Augustus and Charlemagne. The
      ruins of the Septizonium were still defended by the nephew of
      Gregory: the pope himself was invested in the castle of St.
      Angelo; and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his
      Norman vassal. Their friendship had been interrupted by some
      reciprocal injuries and complaints; but, on this pressing
      occasion, Guiscard was urged by the obligation of his oath, by
      his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and
      his enmity to the two emperors. Unfurling the holy banner, he
      resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the
      most numerous of his armies, six thousand horse, and thirty
      thousand foot, was instantly assembled; and his march from
      Salerno to Rome was animated by the public applause and the
      promise of the divine favor. Henry, invincible in sixty-six
      battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some indispensable
      affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted the
      Romans to persevere in their allegiance; and hastily retreated
      three days before the entrance of the Normans. In less than three
      years, the son of Tancred of Hauteville enjoyed the glory of
      delivering the pope, and of compelling the two emperors, of the
      East and West, to fly before his victorious arms. 85 But the
      triumph of Robert was clouded by the calamities of Rome. By the
      aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had been perforated or
      scaled; but the Imperial faction was still powerful and active;
      on the third day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and a
      hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the
      signal of fire and pillage. 86 The Saracens of Sicily, the
      subjects of Roger, and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this
      fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy city of the
      Christians: many thousands of the citizens, in the sight, and by
      the allies, of their spiritual father were exposed to violation,
      captivity, or death; and a spacious quarter of the city, from the
      Lateran to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted
      to perpetual solitude. 87 From a city, where he was now hated,
      and might be no longer feared, Gregory retired to end his days in
      the palace of Salerno. The artful pontiff might flatter the
      vanity of Guiscard with the hope of a Roman or Imperial crown;
      but this dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the
      ambition of the Norman, must forever have alienated the most
      faithful princes of Germany.

      81 (return) [ The epistle itself (Alexias, l. iii. p. 93, 94, 95)
      well deserves to be read. There is one expression which Ducange
      does not understand. I have endeavored to grope out a tolerable
      meaning: The first word is a golden crown; the second is
      explained by Simon Portius, (in Lexico Graeco-Barbar.,) by a
      flash of lightning.]

      82 (return) [ For these general events I must refer to the
      general historians Sigonius, Baronius, Muratori, Mosheim, St.
      Marc, &c.]

      83 (return) [ The lives of Gregory VII. are either legends or
      invectives, (St. Marc, Abrege, tom. iii. p. 235, &c.;) and his
      miraculous or magical performances are alike incredible to a
      modern reader. He will, as usual, find some instruction in Le
      Clerc, (Vie de Hildebrand, Bibliot, ancienne et moderne, tom.
      viii.,) and much amusement in Bayle, (Dictionnaire Critique,
      Gregoire VII.) That pope was undoubtedly a great man, a second
      Athanasius, in a more fortunate age of the church. May I presume
      to add, that the portrait of Athanasius is one of the passages of
      my history (vol. ii. p. 332, &c.) with which I am the least
      dissatisfied? * Note: There is a fair life of Gregory VII. by
      Voigt, (Weimar. 1815,) which has been translated into French. M.
      Villemain, it is understood, has devoted much time to the study
      of this remarkable character, to whom his eloquence may do
      justice. There is much valuable information on the subject in the
      accurate work of Stenzel, Geschichte Deutschlands unter den
      Frankischen Kaisern—the History of Germany under the Emperors of
      the Franconian Race.—M.]

      84 (return) [ Anna, with the rancor of a Greek schismatic, calls
      him (l. i. p. 32,) a pope, or priest, worthy to be spit upon and
      accuses him of scourging, shaving, and perhaps of castrating the
      ambassadors of Henry, (p. 31, 33.) But this outrage is improbable
      and doubtful, (see the sensible preface of Cousin.)]

      It is singular enough, that the Apulian, a Latin, should
      distinguish the Greek as the ruler of the Roman empire, (l. iv.

      87 (return) [ After mentioning this devastation, the Jesuit
      Donatus (de Roma veteri et nova, l. iv. c. 8, p. 489) prettily
      adds, Duraret hodieque in Coelio monte, interque ipsum et
      capitolium, miserabilis facies prostrates urbis, nisi in hortorum
      vinetorumque amoenitatem Roma resurrexisset, ut perpetua
      viriditate contegeret vulnera et ruinas suas.]

      The deliverer and scourge of Rome might have indulged himself in
      a season of repose; but in the same year of the flight of the
      German emperor, the indefatigable Robert resumed the design of
      his eastern conquests. The zeal or gratitude of Gregory had
      promised to his valor the kingdoms of Greece and Asia; 88 his
      troops were assembled in arms, flushed with success, and eager
      for action. Their numbers, in the language of Homer, are compared
      by Anna to a swarm of bees; 89 yet the utmost and moderate limits
      of the powers of Guiscard have been already defined; they were
      contained on this second occasion in one hundred and twenty
      vessels; and as the season was far advanced, the harbor of
      Brundusium 90 was preferred to the open road of Otranto. Alexius,
      apprehensive of a second attack, had assiduously labored to
      restore the naval forces of the empire; and obtained from the
      republic of Venice an important succor of thirty-six transports,
      fourteen galleys, and nine galiots or ships of extra-ordinary
      strength and magnitude. Their services were liberally paid by the
      license or monopoly of trade, a profitable gift of many shops and
      houses in the port of Constantinople, and a tribute to St. Mark,
      the more acceptable, as it was the produce of a tax on their
      rivals at Amalphi. By the union of the Greeks and Venetians, the
      Adriatic was covered with a hostile fleet; but their own neglect,
      or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter
      of a mist, opened a free passage; and the Norman troops were
      safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus. With twenty strong and
      well-appointed galleys, their intrepid duke immediately sought
      the enemy, and though more accustomed to fight on horseback, he
      trusted his own life, and the lives of his brother and two sons,
      to the event of a naval combat. The dominion of the sea was
      disputed in three engagements, in sight of the Isle of Corfu: in
      the two former, the skill and numbers of the allies were
      superior; but in the third, the Normans obtained a final and
      complete victory. 91 The light brigantines of the Greeks were
      scattered in ignominious flight: the nine castles of the
      Venetians maintained a more obstinate conflict; seven were sunk,
      two were taken; two thousand five hundred captives implored in
      vain the mercy of the victor; and the daughter of Alexius
      deplores the loss of thirteen thousand of his subjects or allies.
      The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of
      Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a retreat, he
      calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new
      methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the
      advantages of the enemy. The winter season suspended his
      progress: with the return of spring he again aspired to the
      conquest of Constantinople; but, instead of traversing the hills
      of Epirus, he turned his arms against Greece and the islands,
      where the spoils would repay the labor, and where the land and
      sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigor and
      effect. But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects were fatally
      blasted by an epidemical disease: Robert himself, in the
      seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion
      of poison was imputed, by public rumor, to his wife, or to the
      Greek emperor. 92 This premature death might allow a boundless
      scope for the imagination of his future exploits; and the event
      sufficiently declares, that the Norman greatness was founded on
      his life. 93 Without the appearance of an enemy, a victorious
      army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation; and
      Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in his
      deliverance. The galley which transported the remains of Guiscard
      was ship-wrecked on the Italian shore; but the duke’s body was
      recovered from the sea, and deposited in the sepulchre of
      Venusia, 94 a place more illustrious for the birth of Horace 95
      than for the burial of the Norman heroes. Roger, his second son
      and successor, immediately sunk to the humble station of a duke
      of Apulia: the esteem or partiality of his father left the
      valiant Bohemond to the inheritance of his sword.

      The national tranquillity was disturbed by his claims, till the
      first crusade against the infidels of the East opened a more
      splendid field of glory and conquest. 96

      88 (return) [ The royalty of Robert, either promised or bestowed
      by the pope, (Anna, l. i. p. 32,) is sufficiently confirmed by
      the Apulian, (l. iv. p. 270.) —Romani regni sibi promisisse
      coronam Papa ferebatur. Nor can I understand why Gretser, and the
      other papal advocates, should be displeased with this new
      instance of apostolic jurisdiction.]

      i.)]

      90 (return) [ Gulielm. Appulus, l. v. p. 276.) The admirable port
      of Brundusium was double; the outward harbor was a gulf covered
      by an island, and narrowing by degrees, till it communicated by a
      small gullet with the inner harbor, which embraced the city on
      both sides. Caesar and nature have labored for its ruin; and
      against such agents what are the feeble efforts of the Neapolitan
      government? (Swinburne’s Travels in the Two Sicilies, vol. i. p.

      91 (return) [ William of Apulia (l. v. p. 276) describes the
      victory of the Normans, and forgets the two previous defeats,
      which are diligently recorded by Anna Comnena, (l. vi. p. 159,
      160, 161.) In her turn, she invents or magnifies a fourth action,
      to give the Venetians revenge and rewards. Their own feelings
      were far different, since they deposed their doge, propter
      excidium stoli, (Dandulus in Chron in Muratori, Script. Rerum
      Italicarum, tom. xii. p. 249.)]

      of Salerno, (Chron. in Muratori, Script. Rerum Ital. tom. vii.,)
      are ignorant of this crime, so apparent to our countrymen William
      of Malmsbury (l. iii. p. 107) and Roger de Hoveden, (p. 710, in
      Script. post Bedam) and the latter can tell, how the just Alexius
      married, crowned, and burnt alive, his female accomplice. The
      English historian is indeed so blind, that he ranks Robert
      Guiscard, or Wiscard, among the knights of Henry I, who ascended
      the throne fifteen years after the duke of Apulia’s death.]

      93 (return) [ The joyful Anna Comnena scatters some flowers over
      the grave of an enemy, (Alexiad, l. v. p. 162-166;) and his best

      Guiscard, which is not worth transcribing.]

      95 (return) [ Yet Horace had few obligations to Venusia; he was
      carried to Rome in his childhood, (Serm. i. 6;) and his repeated
      allusions to the doubtful limit of Apulia and Lucania (Carm. iii.
      4, Serm. ii. I) are unworthy of his age and genius.]

      96 (return) [ See Giannone (tom. ii. p. 88-93) and the historians
      of the fire crusade.]

      Of human life, the most glorious or humble prospects are alike
      and soon bounded by the sepulchre. The male line of Robert
      Guiscard was extinguished, both in Apulia and at Antioch, in the
      second generation; but his younger brother became the father of a
      line of kings; and the son of the great count was endowed with
      the name, the conquests, and the spirit, of the first Roger. 97
      The heir of that Norman adventurer was born in Sicily; and, at
      the age of only four years, he succeeded to the sovereignty of
      the island, a lot which reason might envy, could she indulge for
      a moment the visionary, though virtuous wish of dominion. Had
      Roger been content with his fruitful patrimony, a happy and
      grateful people might have blessed their benefactor; and if a
      wise administration could have restored the prosperous times of
      the Greek colonies, 98 the opulence and power of Sicily alone
      might have equalled the widest scope that could be acquired and
      desolated by the sword of war. But the ambition of the great
      count was ignorant of these noble pursuits; it was gratified by
      the vulgar means of violence and artifice. He sought to obtain
      the undivided possession of Palermo, of which one moiety had been
      ceded to the elder branch; struggled to enlarge his Calabrian
      limits beyond the measure of former treaties; and impatiently
      watched the declining health of his cousin William of Apulia, the
      grandson of Robert. On the first intelligence of his premature
      death, Roger sailed from Palermo with seven galleys, cast anchor
      in the Bay of Salerno, received, after ten days’ negotiation, an
      oath of fidelity from the Norman capital, commanded the
      submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from
      the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the
      friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal. The sacred spot of
      Benevento was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St. Peter;
      but the reduction of Capua and Naples completed the design of his
      uncle Guiscard; and the sole inheritance of the Norman conquests
      was possessed by the victorious Roger. A conscious superiority of
      power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of
      count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a third perhaps of the
      continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom 99 which
      would only yield to the monarchies of France and England. The
      chiefs of the nation who attended his coronation at Palermo might
      doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them;
      but the example of a Greek tyrant or a Saracen emir was
      insufficient to justify his regal character; and the nine kings
      of the Latin world 100 might disclaim their new associate, unless
      he were consecrated by the authority of the supreme pontiff. The
      pride of Anacletus was pleased to confer a title, which the pride
      of the Norman had stooped to solicit; 101 but his own legitimacy
      was attacked by the adverse election of Innocent the Second; and
      while Anacletus sat in the Vatican, the successful fugitive was
      acknowledged by the nations of Europe. The infant monarchy of
      Roger was shaken, and almost overthrown, by the unlucky choice of
      an ecclesiastical patron; and the sword of Lothaire the Second of
      Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa,
      and the zeal of St. Bernard, were united for the ruin of the
      Sicilian robber. After a gallant resistance, the Norman prince
      was driven from the continent of Italy: a new duke of Apulia was
      invested by the pope and the emperor, each of whom held one end
      of the gonfanon, or flagstaff, as a token that they asserted
      their right, and suspended their quarrel. But such jealous
      friendship was of short and precarious duration: the German
      armies soon vanished in disease and desertion: 102 the Apulian
      duke, with all his adherents, was exterminated by a conqueror who
      seldom forgave either the dead or the living; like his
      predecessor Leo the Ninth, the feeble though haughty pontiff
      became the captive and friend of the Normans; and their
      reconciliation was celebrated by the eloquence of Bernard, who
      now revered the title and virtues of the king of Sicily.

      As a penance for his impious war against the successor of St.
      Peter, that monarch might have promised to display the banner of
      the cross, and he accomplished with ardor a vow so propitious to
      his interest and revenge. The recent injuries of Sicily might
      provoke a just retaliation on the heads of the Saracens: the
      Normans, whose blood had been mingled with so many subject
      streams, were encouraged to remember and emulate the naval
      trophies of their fathers, and in the maturity of their strength
      they contended with the decline of an African power. When the
      Fatimite caliph departed for the conquest of Egypt, he rewarded
      the real merit and apparent fidelity of his servant Joseph with a
      gift of his royal mantle, and forty Arabian horses, his palace
      with its sumptuous furniture, and the government of the kingdoms
      of Tunis and Algiers. The Zeirides, 103 the descendants of
      Joseph, forgot their allegiance and gratitude to a distant
      benefactor, grasped and abused the fruits of prosperity; and
      after running the little course of an Oriental dynasty, were now
      fainting in their own weakness. On the side of the land, they
      were pressed by the Almohades, the fanatic princes of Morocco,
      while the sea-coast was open to the enterprises of the Greeks and
      Franks, who, before the close of the eleventh century, had
      extorted a ransom of two hundred thousand pieces of gold. By the
      first arms of Roger, the island or rock of Malta, which has been
      since ennobled by a military and religious colony, was
      inseparably annexed to the crown of Sicily. Tripoli, 104 a strong
      and maritime city, was the next object of his attack; and the
      slaughter of the males, the captivity of the females, might be
      justified by the frequent practice of the Moslems themselves. The
      capital of the Zeirides was named Africa from the country, and
      Mahadia 105 from the Arabian founder: it is strongly built on a
      neck of land, but the imperfection of the harbor is not
      compensated by the fertility of the adjacent plain. Mahadia was
      besieged by George the Sicilian admiral, with a fleet of one
      hundred and fifty galleys, amply provided with men and the
      instruments of mischief: the sovereign had fled, the Moorish
      governor refused to capitulate, declined the last and
      irresistible assault, and secretly escaping with the Moslem
      inhabitants abandoned the place and its treasures to the
      rapacious Franks. In successive expeditions, the king of Sicily
      or his lieutenants reduced the cities of Tunis, Safax, Capsia,
      Bona, and a long tract of the sea-coast; 106 the fortresses were
      garrisoned, the country was tributary, and a boast that it held
      Africa in subjection might be inscribed with some flattery on the
      sword of Roger. 107 After his death, that sword was broken; and
      these transmarine possessions were neglected, evacuated, or lost,
      under the troubled reign of his successor. 108 The triumphs of
      Scipio and Belisarius have proved, that the African continent is
      neither inaccessible nor invincible; yet the great princes and
      powers of Christendom have repeatedly failed in their armaments
      against the Moors, who may still glory in the easy conquest and
      long servitude of Spain.

      tom. vii. p. 270, 271) ascribes these losses to the neglect or

      Since the decease of Robert Guiscard, the Normans had
      relinquished, above sixty years, their hostile designs against
      the empire of the East. The policy of Roger solicited a public
      and private union with the Greek princes, whose alliance would
      dignify his regal character: he demanded in marriage a daughter
      of the Comnenian family, and the first steps of the treaty seemed
      to promise a favorable event. But the contemptuous treatment of
      his ambassadors exasperated the vanity of the new monarch; and
      the insolence of the Byzantine court was expiated, according to
      the laws of nations, by the sufferings of a guiltless people. 109
      With the fleet of seventy galleys, George, the admiral of Sicily,
      appeared before Corfu; and both the island and city were
      delivered into his hands by the disaffected inhabitants, who had
      yet to learn that a siege is still more calamitous than a
      tribute. In this invasion, of some moment in the annals of
      commerce, the Normans spread themselves by sea, and over the
      provinces of Greece; and the venerable age of Athens, Thebes, and
      Corinth, was violated by rapine and cruelty. Of the wrongs of
      Athens, no memorial remains. The ancient walls, which
      encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were
      scaled by the Latin Christians; but their sole use of the gospel
      was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted
      any relic of their inheritance or industry. On the approach of
      the Normans, the lower town of Corinth was evacuated; the Greeks
      retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence,
      abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an
      impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by
      any advantages of art or nature. As soon as the besiegers had
      surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill,
      their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own
      victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from
      the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint. The
      silk weavers of both sexes, whom George transported to Sicily,
      composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing
      the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice
      of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom
      were the only weapons which the Greeks were capable of using. The
      progress of this naval armament was marked by two conspicuous
      events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the
      Byzantine capital. In his return by sea from an unfortunate
      crusade, Louis the Seventh was intercepted by the Greeks, who
      basely violated the laws of honor and religion. The fortunate
      encounter of the Norman fleet delivered the royal captive; and
      after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily,
      Louis continued his journey to Rome and Paris. 110 In the absence
      of the emperor, Constantinople and the Hellespont were left
      without defence and without the suspicion of danger. The clergy
      and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel)
      were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line
      of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the Imperial
      city. The forces of the Sicilian admiral were inadequate to the
      siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but
      George enjoyed the glory of humbling the Greek arrogance, and of
      marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West. He landed
      some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and
      pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which
      he discharged against the palace of the Caesars. 111 This playful
      outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded
      moment, Manuel affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and
      the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge. The
      Archipelago and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and
      those of Venice; but I know not by what favorable allowance of
      transports, victuallers, and pinnaces, our reason, or even our
      fancy, can be reconciled to the stupendous account of fifteen
      hundred vessels, which is proposed by a Byzantine historian.
      These operations were directed with prudence and energy: in his
      homeward voyage George lost nineteen of his galleys, which were
      separated and taken: after an obstinate defence, Corfu implored
      the clemency of her lawful sovereign; nor could a ship, a
      soldier, of the Norman prince, be found, unless as a captive,
      within the limits of the Eastern empire. The prosperity and the
      health of Roger were already in a declining state: while he
      listened in his palace of Palermo to the messengers of victory or
      defeat, the invincible Manuel, the foremost in every assault, was
      celebrated by the Greeks and Latins as the Alexander or the
      Hercules of the age.

      compiler, Vincent de Beauvais, are again transmuted into gold.]




      Chapter LVI: The Saracens, The Franks And The Normans.—Part V.

      A prince of such a temper could not be satisfied with having
      repelled the insolence of a Barbarian. It was the right and duty,
      it might be the interest and glory, of Manuel to restore the
      ancient majesty of the empire, to recover the provinces of Italy
      and Sicily, and to chastise this pretended king, the grandson of
      a Norman vassal. 112 The natives of Calabria were still attached
      to the Greek language and worship, which had been inexorably
      proscribed by the Latin clergy: after the loss of her dukes,
      Apulia was chained as a servile appendage to the crown of Sicily;
      the founder of the monarchy had ruled by the sword; and his death
      had abated the fear, without healing the discontent, of his
      subjects: the feudal government was always pregnant with the
      seeds of rebellion; and a nephew of Roger himself invited the
      enemies of his family and nation. The majesty of the purple, and
      a series of Hungarian and Turkish wars, prevented Manuel from
      embarking his person in the Italian expedition. To the brave and
      noble Palaeologus, his lieutenant, the Greek monarch intrusted a
      fleet and army: the siege of Bari was his first exploit; and, in
      every operation, gold as well as steel was the instrument of
      victory. Salerno, and some places along the western coast,
      maintained their fidelity to the Norman king; but he lost in two
      campaigns the greater part of his continental possessions; and
      the modest emperor, disdaining all flattery and falsehood, was
      content with the reduction of three hundred cities or villages of
      Apulia and Calabria, whose names and titles were inscribed on all
      the walls of the palace. The prejudices of the Latins were
      gratified by a genuine or fictitious donation under the seal of
      the German Caesars; 113 but the successor of Constantine soon
      renounced this ignominious pretence, claimed the indefeasible
      dominion of Italy, and professed his design of chasing the
      Barbarians beyond the Alps. By the artful speeches, liberal
      gifts, and unbounded promises, of their Eastern ally, the free
      cities were encouraged to persevere in their generous struggle
      against the despotism of Frederic Barbarossa: the walls of Milan
      were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says
      the historian, a river of gold into the bosom of Ancona, whose
      attachment to the Greeks was fortified by the jealous enmity of
      the Venetians. 114 The situation and trade of Ancona rendered it
      an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice
      besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice
      repulsed by the spirit of freedom; that spirit was animated by
      the ambassador of Constantinople; and the most intrepid patriots,
      the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and
      honors of the Byzantine court. 115 The pride of Manuel disdained
      and rejected a Barbarian colleague; his ambition was excited by
      the hope of stripping the purple from the German usurpers, and of
      establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of
      sole emperor of the Romans. With this view, he solicited the
      alliance of the people and the bishop of Rome. Several of the
      nobles embraced the cause of the Greek monarch; the splendid
      nuptials of his niece with Odo Frangipani secured the support of
      that powerful family, 116 and his royal standard or image was
      entertained with due reverence in the ancient metropolis. 117
      During the quarrel between Frederic and Alexander the Third, the
      pope twice received in the Vatican the ambassadors of
      Constantinople. They flattered his piety by the long-promised
      union of the two churches, tempted the avarice of his venal
      court, and exhorted the Roman pontiff to seize the just
      provocation, the favorable moment, to humble the savage insolence
      of the Alemanni and to acknowledge the true representative of
      Constantine and Augustus. 118

      112 (return) [ For the invasion of Italy, which is almost
      overlooked by Nicetas see the more polite history of Cinnamus,

      by a lofty profession, iii. 5.]

      113 (return) [ The Latin, Otho, (de Gestis Frederici I. l. ii. c.
      30, p. 734,) attests the forgery; the Greek, Cinnamus, (l. iv. c.
      1, p. 78,) claims a promise of restitution from Conrad and
      Frederic. An act of fraud is always credible when it is told of
      the Greeks.]

      iv. c. 14, p. 98.)]

      115 (return) [ Muratori mentions the two sieges of Ancona; the
      first, in 1167, against Frederic I. in person (Annali, tom. x. p.
      39, &c.;) the second, in 1173, against his lieutenant Christian,
      archbishop of Mentz, a man unworthy of his name and office, (p.
      76, &c.) It is of the second siege that we possess an original
      narrative, which he has published in his great collection, (tom.
      vi. p. 921-946.)]

      116 (return) [ We derive this anecdote from an anonymous
      chronicle of Fossa Nova, published by Muratori, (Script. Ital.
      tom. vii. p. 874.)]

      117 (return) [ Cinnamus (l. iv. c. 14, p. 99) is susceptible of
      this double sense. A standard is more Latin, an image more
      Greek.]

      118 (return) [ Nihilominus quoque petebat, ut quia occasio justa
      et tempos opportunum et acceptabile se obtulerant, Romani corona

      Alexandri III. a Cardinal. Arragoniae, in Script. Rerum Ital.
      tom. iii. par. i. p. 458.) His second embassy was accompanied cum
      immensa multitudine pecuniarum.]

      But these Italian conquests, this universal reign, soon escaped
      from the hand of the Greek emperor. His first demands were eluded
      by the prudence of Alexander the Third, who paused on this deep
      and momentous revolution; 119 nor could the pope be seduced by a
      personal dispute to renounce the perpetual inheritance of the
      Latin name. After the reunion with Frederic, he spoke a more
      peremptory language, confirmed the acts of his predecessors,
      excommunicated the adherents of Manuel, and pronounced the final
      separation of the churches, or at least the empires, of
      Constantinople and Rome. 120 The free cities of Lombardy no
      longer remembered their foreign benefactor, and without
      preserving the friendship of Ancona, he soon incurred the enmity
      of Venice. 121 By his own avarice, or the complaints of his
      subjects, the Greek emperor was provoked to arrest the persons,
      and confiscate the effects, of the Venetian merchants. This
      violation of the public faith exasperated a free and commercial
      people: one hundred galleys were launched and armed in as many
      days; they swept the coasts of Dalmatia and Greece: but after
      some mutual wounds, the war was terminated by an agreement,
      inglorious to the empire, insufficient for the republic; and a
      complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved
      for the succeeding generation. The lieutenant of Manuel had
      informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any
      domestic revolt of Apulia and Calabria; but that his forces were
      inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.
      His prophecy was soon verified: the death of Palaeologus devolved
      the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike
      defective in military talents; the Greeks were oppressed by land
      and sea; and a captive remnant that escaped the swords of the
      Normans and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the
      person or dominions of their conqueror. 122 Yet the king of
      Sicily esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had
      landed a second army on the Italian shore; he respectfully
      addressed the new Justinian; solicited a peace or truce of thirty
      years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged
      himself the military vassal of the Roman empire. 123 The
      Byzantine Caesars acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without
      expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a Norman
      army; and the truce of thirty years was not disturbed by any
      hostilities between Sicily and Constantinople. About the end of
      that period, the throne of Manuel was usurped by an inhuman
      tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and
      mankind: the sword of William the Second, the grandson of Roger,
      was drawn by a fugitive of the Comnenian race; and the subjects
      of Andronicus might salute the strangers as friends, since they
      detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies. The Latin
      historians 124 expatiate on the rapid progress of the four counts
      who invaded Romania with a fleet and army, and reduced many
      castles and cities to the obedience of the king of Sicily. The
      Greeks 125 accuse and magnify the wanton and sacrilegious
      cruelties that were perpetrated in the sack of Thessalonica, the
      second city of the empire. The former deplore the fate of those
      invincible but unsuspecting warriors who were destroyed by the
      arts of a vanquished foe. The latter applaud, in songs of
      triumph, the repeated victories of their countrymen on the Sea of
      Marmora or Propontis, on the banks of the Strymon, and under the
      walls of Durazzo. A revolution which punished the crimes of
      Andronicus, had united against the Franks the zeal and courage of
      the successful insurgents: ten thousand were slain in battle, and
      Isaac Angelus, the new emperor, might indulge his vanity or
      vengeance in the treatment of four thousand captives. Such was
      the event of the last contest between the Greeks and Normans:
      before the expiration of twenty years, the rival nations were
      lost or degraded in foreign servitude; and the successors of
      Constantine did not long survive to insult the fall of the
      Sicilian monarchy.

      The sceptre of Roger successively devolved to his son and
      grandson: they might be confounded under the name of William:
      they are strongly discriminated by the epithets of the bad and
      the good; but these epithets, which appear to describe the
      perfection of vice and virtue, cannot strictly be applied to
      either of the Norman princes. When he was roused to arms by
      danger and shame, the first William did not degenerate from the
      valor of his race; but his temper was slothful; his manners were
      dissolute; his passions headstrong and mischievous; and the
      monarch is responsible, not only for his personal vices, but for
      those of Majo, the great admiral, who abused the confidence, and
      conspired against the life, of his benefactor. From the Arabian
      conquest, Sicily had imbibed a deep tincture of Oriental manners;
      the despotism, the pomp, and even the harem, of a sultan; and a
      Christian people was oppressed and insulted by the ascendant of
      the eunuchs, who openly professed, or secretly cherished, the
      religion of Mahomet. An eloquent historian of the times 126 has
      delineated the misfortunes of his country: 127 the ambition and
      fall of the ungrateful Majo; the revolt and punishment of his
      assassins; the imprisonment and deliverance of the king himself;
      the private feuds that arose from the public confusion; and the
      various forms of calamity and discord which afflicted Palermo,
      the island, and the continent, during the reign of William the
      First, and the minority of his son. The youth, innocence, and
      beauty of William the Second, 128 endeared him to the nation: the
      factions were reconciled; the laws were revived; and from the
      manhood to the premature death of that amiable prince, Sicily
      enjoyed a short season of peace, justice, and happiness, whose
      value was enhanced by the remembrance of the past and the dread
      of futurity. The legitimate male posterity of Tancred of
      Hauteville was extinct in the person of the second William; but
      his aunt, the daughter of Roger, had married the most powerful
      prince of the age; and Henry the Sixth, the son of Frederic
      Barbarossa, descended from the Alps to claim the Imperial crown
      and the inheritance of his wife. Against the unanimous wish of a
      free people, this inheritance could only be acquired by arms; and
      I am pleased to transcribe the style and sense of the historian
      Falcandus, who writes at the moment, and on the spot, with the
      feelings of a patriot, and the prophetic eye of a statesman.
      “Constantia, the daughter of Sicily, nursed from her cradle in
      the pleasures and plenty, and educated in the arts and manners,
      of this fortunate isle, departed long since to enrich the
      Barbarians with our treasures, and now returns, with her savage
      allies, to contaminate the beauties of her venerable parent.
      Already I behold the swarms of angry Barbarians: our opulent
      cities, the places flourishing in a long peace, are shaken with
      fear, desolated by slaughter, consumed by rapine, and polluted by
      intemperance and lust. I see the massacre or captivity of our
      citizens, the rapes of our virgins and matrons. 129 In this
      extremity (he interrogates a friend) how must the Sicilians act?
      By the unanimous election of a king of valor and experience,
      Sicily and Calabria might yet be preserved; 130 for in the levity
      of the Apulians, ever eager for new revolutions, I can repose
      neither confidence nor hope. 131 Should Calabria be lost, the
      lofty towers, the numerous youth, and the naval strength, of
      Messina, 132 might guard the passage against a foreign invader.
      If the savage Germans coalesce with the pirates of Messina; if
      they destroy with fire the fruitful region, so often wasted by
      the fires of Mount Aetna, 133 what resource will be left for the
      interior parts of the island, these noble cities which should
      never be violated by the hostile footsteps of a Barbarian? 134
      Catana has again been overwhelmed by an earthquake: the ancient
      virtue of Syracuse expires in poverty and solitude; 135 but
      Palermo is still crowned with a diadem, and her triple walls
      enclose the active multitudes of Christians and Saracens. If the
      two nations, under one king, can unite for their common safety,
      they may rush on the Barbarians with invincible arms. But if the
      Saracens, fatigued by a repetition of injuries, should now retire
      and rebel; if they should occupy the castles of the mountains and
      sea-coast, the unfortunate Christians, exposed to a double
      attack, and placed as it were between the hammer and the anvil,
      must resign themselves to hopeless and inevitable servitude.” 136
      We must not forget, that a priest here prefers his country to his
      religion; and that the Moslems, whose alliance he seeks, were
      still numerous and powerful in the state of Sicily.

      126 (return) [ The Historia Sicula of Hugo Falcandus, which
      properly extends from 1154 to 1169, is inserted in the viiith
      volume of Muratori’s Collection, (tom. vii. p. 259-344,) and
      preceded by a eloquent preface or epistle, (p. 251-258, de
      Calamitatibus Siciliae.) Falcandus has been styled the Tacitus of
      Sicily; and, after a just, but immense, abatement, from the ist
      to the xiith century, from a senator to a monk, I would not strip
      him of his title: his narrative is rapid and perspicuous, his
      style bold and elegant, his observation keen; he had studied
      mankind, and feels like a man. I can only regret the narrow and
      barren field on which his labors have been cast.]

      127 (return) [ The laborious Benedictines (l’Art de verifier les
      Dates, p. 896) are of opinion, that the true name of Falcandus is
      Fulcandus, or Foucault. According to them, Hugues Foucalt, a
      Frenchman by birth, and at length abbot of St. Denys, had
      followed into Sicily his patron Stephen de la Perche, uncle to
      the mother of William II., archbishop of Palermo, and great
      chancellor of the kingdom. Yet Falcandus has all the feelings of
      a Sicilian; and the title of Alumnus (which he bestows on
      himself) appears to indicate that he was born, or at least
      educated, in the island.]

      The hopes, or at least the wishes, of Falcandus were at first
      gratified by the free and unanimous election of Tancred, the
      grandson of the first king, whose birth was illegitimate, but
      whose civil and military virtues shone without a blemish. During
      four years, the term of his life and reign, he stood in arms on
      the farthest verge of the Apulian frontier, against the powers of
      Germany; and the restitution of a royal captive, of Constantia
      herself, without injury or ransom, may appear to surpass the most
      liberal measure of policy or reason. After his decease, the
      kingdom of his widow and infant son fell without a struggle; and
      Henry pursued his victorious march from Capua to Palermo. The
      political balance of Italy was destroyed by his success; and if
      the pope and the free cities had consulted their obvious and real
      interest, they would have combined the powers of earth and heaven
      to prevent the dangerous union of the German empire with the
      kingdom of Sicily. But the subtle policy, for which the Vatican
      has so often been praised or arraigned, was on this occasion
      blind and inactive; and if it were true that Celestine the Third
      had kicked away the Imperial crown from the head of the prostrate
      Henry, 137 such an act of impotent pride could serve only to
      cancel an obligation and provoke an enemy. The Genoese, who
      enjoyed a beneficial trade and establishment in Sicily, listened
      to the promise of his boundless gratitude and speedy departure:
      138 their fleet commanded the straits of Messina, and opened the
      harbor of Palermo; and the first act of his government was to
      abolish the privileges, and to seize the property, of these
      imprudent allies. The last hope of Falcandus was defeated by the
      discord of the Christians and Mahometans: they fought in the
      capital; several thousands of the latter were slain; but their
      surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above
      thirty years the peace of the island. By the policy of Frederic
      the Second, sixty thousand Saracens were transplanted to Nocera
      in Apulia. In their wars against the Roman church, the emperor
      and his son Mainfroy were strengthened and disgraced by the
      service of the enemies of Christ; and this national colony
      maintained their religion and manners in the heart of Italy, till
      they were extirpated, at the end of the thirteenth century, by
      the zeal and revenge of the house of Anjou. 139 All the
      calamities which the prophetic orator had deplored were surpassed
      by the cruelty and avarice of the German conqueror. He violated
      the royal sepulchres, 1391 and explored the secret treasures of
      the palace, Palermo, and the whole kingdom: the pearls and
      jewels, however precious, might be easily removed; but one
      hundred and sixty horses were laden with the gold and silver of
      Sicily. 140 The young king, his mother and sisters, and the
      nobles of both sexes, were separately confined in the fortresses
      of the Alps; and, on the slightest rumor of rebellion, the
      captives were deprived of life, of their eyes, or of the hope of
      posterity. Constantia herself was touched with sympathy for the
      miseries of her country; and the heiress of the Norman line might
      struggle to check her despotic husband, and to save the patrimony
      of her new-born son, of an emperor so famous in the next age
      under the name of Frederic the Second. Ten years after this
      revolution, the French monarchs annexed to their crown the duchy
      of Normandy: the sceptre of her ancient dukes had been
      transmitted, by a granddaughter of William the Conqueror, to the
      house of Plantagenet; and the adventurous Normans, who had raised
      so many trophies in France, England, and Ireland, in Apulia,
      Sicily, and the East, were lost, either in victory or servitude,
      among the vanquished nations.

      gloriose ad terram suam redierit. Roger de Hoveden, who mentions
      the violation of the royal tombs and corpses, computes the spoil
      of Salerno at 200,000 ounces of gold, (p. 746.) On these
      occasions, I am almost tempted to exclaim with the listening maid
      in La Fontaine, “Je voudrois bien avoir ce qui manque.”]
