      During the last years of Justinian, his infirm mind was devoted
      to heavenly contemplation, and he neglected the business of the
      lower world. His subjects were impatient of the long continuance
      of his life and reign: yet all who were capable of reflection
      apprehended the moment of his death, which might involve the
      capital in tumult, and the empire in civil war. Seven nephews 1
      of the childless monarch, the sons or grandsons of his brother
      and sister, had been educated in the splendor of a princely
      fortune; they had been shown in high commands to the provinces
      and armies; their characters were known, their followers were
      zealous, and, as the jealousy of age postponed the declaration of
      a successor, they might expect with equal hopes the inheritance
      of their uncle. He expired in his palace, after a reign of
      thirty-eight years; and the decisive opportunity was embraced by
      the friends of Justin, the son of Vigilantia. 2 At the hour of
      midnight, his domestics were awakened by an importunate crowd,
      who thundered at his door, and obtained admittance by revealing
      themselves to be the principal members of the senate. These
      welcome deputies announced the recent and momentous secret of the
      emperor’s decease; reported, or perhaps invented, his dying
      choice of the best beloved and most deserving of his nephews, and
      conjured Justin to prevent the disorders of the multitude, if
      they should perceive, with the return of light, that they were
      left without a master. After composing his countenance to
      surprise, sorrow, and decent modesty, Justin, by the advice of
      his wife Sophia, submitted to the authority of the senate. He was
      conducted with speed and silence to the palace; the guards
      saluted their new sovereign; and the martial and religious rites
      of his coronation were diligently accomplished. By the hands of
      the proper officers he was invested with the Imperial garments,
      the red buskins, white tunic, and purple robe.

      A fortunate soldier, whom he instantly promoted to the rank of
      tribune, encircled his neck with a military collar; four robust
      youths exalted him on a shield; he stood firm and erect to
      receive the adoration of his subjects; and their choice was
      sanctified by the benediction of the patriarch, who imposed the
      diadem on the head of an orthodox prince. The hippodrome was
      already filled with innumerable multitudes; and no sooner did the
      emperor appear on his throne, than the voices of the blue and the
      green factions were confounded in the same loyal acclamations. In
      the speeches which Justin addressed to the senate and people, he
      promised to correct the abuses which had disgraced the age of his
      predecessor, displayed the maxims of a just and beneficent
      government, and declared that, on the approaching calends of
      January, 3 he would revive in his own person the name and liberty
      of a Roman consul. The immediate discharge of his uncle’s debts
      exhibited a solid pledge of his faith and generosity: a train of
      porters, laden with bags of gold, advanced into the midst of the
      hippodrome, and the hopeless creditors of Justinian accepted this
      equitable payment as a voluntary gift. Before the end of three
      years, his example was imitated and surpassed by the empress
      Sophia, who delivered many indigent citizens from the weight of
      debt and usury: an act of benevolence the best entitled to
      gratitude, since it relieves the most intolerable distress; but
      in which the bounty of a prince is the most liable to be abused
      by the claims of prodigality and fraud. 4

      On the seventh day of his reign, Justin gave audience to the
      ambassadors of the Avars, and the scene was decorated to impress
      the Barbarians with astonishment, veneration, and terror. From
      the palace gate, the spacious courts and long porticos were lined
      with the lofty crests and gilt bucklers of the guards, who
      presented their spears and axes with more confidence than they
      would have shown in a field of battle. The officers who exercised
      the power, or attended the person, of the prince, were attired in
      their richest habits, and arranged according to the military and
      civil order of the hierarchy. When the veil of the sanctuary was
      withdrawn, the ambassadors beheld the emperor of the East on his
      throne, beneath a canopy, or dome, which was supported by four
      columns, and crowned with a winged figure of Victory. In the
      first emotions of surprise, they submitted to the servile
      adoration of the Byzantine court; but as soon as they rose from
      the ground, Targetius, the chief of the embassy, expressed the
      freedom and pride of a Barbarian. He extolled, by the tongue of
      his interpreter, the greatness of the chagan, by whose clemency
      the kingdoms of the South were permitted to exist, whose
      victorious subjects had traversed the frozen rivers of Scythia,
      and who now covered the banks of the Danube with innumerable
      tents. The late emperor had cultivated, with annual and costly
      gifts, the friendship of a grateful monarch, and the enemies of
      Rome had respected the allies of the Avars. The same prudence
      would instruct the nephew of Justinian to imitate the liberality
      of his uncle, and to purchase the blessings of peace from an
      invincible people, who delighted and excelled in the exercise of
      war. The reply of the emperor was delivered in the same strain of
      haughty defiance, and he derived his confidence from the God of
      the Christians, the ancient glory of Rome, and the recent
      triumphs of Justinian. “The empire,” said he, “abounds with men
      and horses, and arms sufficient to defend our frontiers, and to
      chastise the Barbarians. You offer aid, you threaten hostilities:
      we despise your enmity and your aid. The conquerors of the Avars
      solicit our alliance; shall we dread their fugitives and exiles?
      5 The bounty of our uncle was granted to your misery, to your
      humble prayers. From us you shall receive a more important
      obligation, the knowledge of your own weakness. Retire from our
      presence; the lives of ambassadors are safe; and, if you return
      to implore our pardon, perhaps you will taste of our
      benevolence.” 6 On the report of his ambassadors, the chagan was
      awed by the apparent firmness of a Roman emperor of whose
      character and resources he was ignorant. Instead of executing his
      threats against the Eastern empire, he marched into the poor and
      savage countries of Germany, which were subject to the dominion
      of the Franks. After two doubtful battles, he consented to
      retire, and the Austrasian king relieved the distress of his camp
      with an immediate supply of corn and cattle. 7 Such repeated
      disappointments had chilled the spirit of the Avars, and their
      power would have dissolved away in the Sarmatian desert, if the
      alliance of Alboin, king of the Lombards, had not given a new
      object to their arms, and a lasting settlement to their wearied
      fortunes.

      relates to the Turks, the conquerors of the Avars; but the word
      scultor has no apparent meaning, and the sole Ms. of Corippus,

      is no longer visible. The last editor, Foggini of Rome, has
      inserted the conjectural emendation of soldan: but the proofs of
      Ducange, (Joinville, Dissert. xvi. p. 238—240,) for the early use
      of this title among the Turks and Persians, are weak or
      ambiguous. And I must incline to the authority of D’Herbelot,
      (Bibliotheque Orient. p. 825,) who ascribes the word to the
      Arabic and Chaldaean tongues, and the date to the beginning of
      the xith century, when it was bestowed by the khalif of Bagdad on
      Mahmud, prince of Gazna, and conqueror of India.]

      of Corippus (l. iii. 251—401) with the prose of Menander,
      (Excerpt. Legation. p 102, 103.) Their diversity proves that they
      did not copy each other their resemblance, that they drew from a
      common original.]

      Legat. p. 110,) Gregory of Tours, (Hist. Franc. l. iv. c 29,) and
      Paul the deacon, (de Gest. Langobard. l. ii. c. 10.)]

      While Alboin served under his father’s standard, he encountered
      in battle, and transpierced with his lance, the rival prince of
      the Gepidae. The Lombards, who applauded such early prowess,
      requested his father, with unanimous acclamations, that the
      heroic youth, who had shared the dangers of the field, might be
      admitted to the feast of victory. “You are not unmindful,”
      replied the inflexible Audoin, “of the wise customs of our
      ancestors. Whatever may be his merit, a prince is incapable of
      sitting at table with his father till he has received his arms
      from a foreign and royal hand.” Alboin bowed with reverence to
      the institutions of his country, selected forty companions, and
      boldly visited the court of Turisund, king of the Gepidae, who
      embraced and entertained, according to the laws of hospitality,
      the murderer of his son. At the banquet, whilst Alboin occupied
      the seat of the youth whom he had slain, a tender remembrance
      arose in the mind of Turisund. “How dear is that place! how
      hateful is that person!” were the words that escaped, with a
      sigh, from the indignant father. His grief exasperated the
      national resentment of the Gepidae; and Cunimund, his surviving
      son, was provoked by wine, or fraternal affection, to the desire
      of vengeance. “The Lombards,” said the rude Barbarian, “resemble,
      in figure and in smell, the mares of our Sarmatian plains.” And
      this insult was a coarse allusion to the white bands which
      enveloped their legs. “Add another resemblance,” replied an
      audacious Lombard; “you have felt how strongly they kick. Visit
      the plain of Asfield, and seek for the bones of thy brother: they
      are mingled with those of the vilest animals.” The Gepidae, a
      nation of warriors, started from their seats, and the fearless
      Alboin, with his forty companions, laid their hands on their
      swords. The tumult was appeased by the venerable interposition of
      Turisund. He saved his own honor, and the life of his guest; and,
      after the solemn rites of investiture, dismissed the stranger in
      the bloody arms of his son; the gift of a weeping parent. Alboin
      returned in triumph; and the Lombards, who celebrated his
      matchless intrepidity, were compelled to praise the virtues of an
      enemy. 8 In this extraordinary visit he had probably seen the
      daughter of Cunimund, who soon after ascended the throne of the
      Gepidae. Her name was Rosamond, an appellation expressive of
      female beauty, and which our own history or romance has
      consecrated to amorous tales. The king of the Lombards (the
      father of Alboin no longer lived) was contracted to the
      granddaughter of Clovis; but the restraints of faith and policy
      soon yielded to the hope of possessing the fair Rosamond, and of
      insulting her family and nation. The arts of persuasion were
      tried without success; and the impatient lover, by force and
      stratagem, obtained the object of his desires. War was the
      consequence which he foresaw and solicited; but the Lombards
      could not long withstand the furious assault of the Gepidae, who
      were sustained by a Roman army. And, as the offer of marriage was
      rejected with contempt, Alboin was compelled to relinquish his
      prey, and to partake of the disgrace which he had inflicted on
      the house of Cunimund. 9

      though rudely sketched are more lively and faithful than those of
      Bede, or Gregory of Tours]

      9 (return) [ The story is told by an impostor, (Theophylact.
      Simocat. l. vi. c. 10;) but he had art enough to build his
      fictions on public and notorious facts.]

      When a public quarrel is envenomed by private injuries, a blow
      that is not mortal or decisive can be productive only of a short
      truce, which allows the unsuccessful combatant to sharpen his
      arms for a new encounter. The strength of Alboin had been found
      unequal to the gratification of his love, ambition, and revenge:
      he condescended to implore the formidable aid of the chagan; and
      the arguments that he employed are expressive of the art and
      policy of the Barbarians. In the attack of the Gepidae, he had
      been prompted by the just desire of extirpating a people whom
      their alliance with the Roman empire had rendered the common
      enemies of the nations, and the personal adversaries of the
      chagan. If the forces of the Avars and the Lombards should unite
      in this glorious quarrel, the victory was secure, and the reward
      inestimable: the Danube, the Hebrus, Italy, and Constantinople,
      would be exposed, without a barrier, to their invincible arms.
      But, if they hesitated or delayed to prevent the malice of the
      Romans, the same spirit which had insulted would pursue the Avars
      to the extremity of the earth. These specious reasons were heard
      by the chagan with coldness and disdain: he detained the Lombard
      ambassadors in his camp, protracted the negotiation, and by turns
      alleged his want of inclination, or his want of ability, to
      undertake this important enterprise. At length he signified the
      ultimate price of his alliance, that the Lombards should
      immediately present him with a tithe of their cattle; that the
      spoils and captives should be equally divided; but that the lands
      of the Gepidae should become the sole patrimony of the Avars.
      Such hard conditions were eagerly accepted by the passions of
      Alboin; and, as the Romans were dissatisfied with the ingratitude
      and perfidy of the Gepidae, Justin abandoned that incorrigible
      people to their fate, and remained the tranquil spectator of this
      unequal conflict. The despair of Cunimund was active and
      dangerous. He was informed that the Avars had entered his
      confines; but, on the strong assurance that, after the defeat of
      the Lombards, these foreign invaders would easily be repelled, he
      rushed forwards to encounter the implacable enemy of his name and
      family. But the courage of the Gepidae could secure them no more
      than an honorable death. The bravest of the nation fell in the
      field of battle; the king of the Lombards contemplated with
      delight the head of Cunimund; and his skull was fashioned into a
      cup to satiate the hatred of the conqueror, or, perhaps, to
      comply with the savage custom of his country. 10 After this
      victory, no further obstacle could impede the progress of the
      confederates, and they faithfully executed the terms of their
      agreement. 11 The fair countries of Walachia, Moldavia,
      Transylvania, and the other parts of Hungary beyond the Danube,
      were occupied, without resistance, by a new colony of Scythians;
      and the Dacian empire of the chagans subsisted with splendor
      above two hundred and thirty years. The nation of the Gepidae was
      dissolved; but, in the distribution of the captives, the slaves
      of the Avars were less fortunate than the companions of the
      Lombards, whose generosity adopted a valiant foe, and whose
      freedom was incompatible with cool and deliberate tyranny. One
      moiety of the spoil introduced into the camp of Alboin more
      wealth than a Barbarian could readily compute. The fair Rosamond
      was persuaded, or compelled, to acknowledge the rights of her
      victorious lover; and the daughter of Cunimund appeared to
      forgive those crimes which might be imputed to her own
      irresistible charms.

      10 (return) [ It appears from Strabo, Pliny, and Ammianus
      Marcellinus, that the same practice was common among the Scythian
      tribes, (Muratori, Scriptores Rer. Italic. tom. i. p. 424.) The
      scalps of North America are likewise trophies of valor. The skull
      of Cunimund was preserved above two hundred years among the
      Lombards; and Paul himself was one of the guests to whom Duke
      Ratchis exhibited this cup on a high festival, (l. ii. c. 28.)]

      The destruction of a mighty kingdom established the fame of
      Alboin. In the days of Charlemagne, the Bavarians, the Saxons,
      and the other tribes of the Teutonic language, still repeated the
      songs which described the heroic virtues, the valor, liberality,
      and fortune of the king of the Lombards. 12 But his ambition was
      yet unsatisfied; and the conqueror of the Gepidae turned his eyes
      from the Danube to the richer banks of the Po, and the Tyber.
      Fifteen years had not elapsed, since his subjects, the
      confederates of Narses, had visited the pleasant climate of
      Italy: the mountains, the rivers, the highways, were familiar to
      their memory: the report of their success, perhaps the view of
      their spoils, had kindled in the rising generation the flame of
      emulation and enterprise. Their hopes were encouraged by the
      spirit and eloquence of Alboin: and it is affirmed, that he spoke
      to their senses, by producing at the royal feast, the fairest and
      most exquisite fruits that grew spontaneously in the garden of
      the world. No sooner had he erected his standard, than the native
      strength of the Lombard was multiplied by the adventurous youth
      of Germany and Scythia. The robust peasantry of Noricum and
      Pannonia had resumed the manners of Barbarians; and the names of
      the Gepidae, Bulgarians, Sarmatians, and Bavarians, may be
      distinctly traced in the provinces of Italy. 13 Of the Saxons,
      the old allies of the Lombards, twenty thousand warriors, with
      their wives and children, accepted the invitation of Alboin.
      Their bravery contributed to his success; but the accession or
      the absence of their numbers was not sensibly felt in the
      magnitude of his host. Every mode of religion was freely
      practised by its respective votaries. The king of the Lombards
      had been educated in the Arian heresy; but the Catholics, in
      their public worship, were allowed to pray for his conversion;
      while the more stubborn Barbarians sacrificed a she-goat, or
      perhaps a captive, to the gods of their fathers. 14 The Lombards,
      and their confederates, were united by their common attachment to
      a chief, who excelled in all the virtues and vices of a savage
      hero; and the vigilance of Alboin provided an ample magazine of
      offensive and defensive arms for the use of the expedition. The
      portable wealth of the Lombards attended the march: their lands
      they cheerfully relinquished to the Avars, on the solemn promise,
      which was made and accepted without a smile, that if they failed
      in the conquest of Italy, these voluntary exiles should be
      reinstated in their former possessions.

      They might have failed, if Narses had been the antagonist of the
      Lombards; and the veteran warriors, the associates of his Gothic
      victory, would have encountered with reluctance an enemy whom
      they dreaded and esteemed. But the weakness of the Byzantine
      court was subservient to the Barbarian cause; and it was for the
      ruin of Italy, that the emperor once listened to the complaints
      of his subjects. The virtues of Narses were stained with avarice;
      and, in his provincial reign of fifteen years, he accumulated a
      treasure of gold and silver which surpassed the modesty of a
      private fortune. His government was oppressive or unpopular, and
      the general discontent was expressed with freedom by the deputies
      of Rome. Before the throne of Justinian they boldly declared,
      that their Gothic servitude had been more tolerable than the
      despotism of a Greek eunuch; and that, unless their tyrant were
      instantly removed, they would consult their own happiness in the
      choice of a master. The apprehension of a revolt was urged by the
      voice of envy and detraction, which had so recently triumphed
      over the merit of Belisarius. A new exarch, Longinus, was
      appointed to supersede the conqueror of Italy, and the base
      motives of his recall were revealed in the insulting mandate of
      the empress Sophia, “that he should leave to men the exercise of
      arms, and return to his proper station among the maidens of the
      palace, where a distaff should be again placed in the hand of the
      eunuch.” “I will spin her such a thread as she shall not easily
      unravel!” is said to have been the reply which indignation and
      conscious virtue extorted from the hero. Instead of attending, a
      slave and a victim, at the gate of the Byzantine palace, he
      retired to Naples, from whence (if any credit is due to the
      belief of the times) Narses invited the Lombards to chastise the
      ingratitude of the prince and people. 15 But the passions of the
      people are furious and changeable, and the Romans soon
      recollected the merits, or dreaded the resentment, of their
      victorious general. By the mediation of the pope, who undertook a
      special pilgrimage to Naples, their repentance was accepted; and
      Narses, assuming a milder aspect and a more dutiful language,
      consented to fix his residence in the Capitol. His death, 16
      though in the extreme period of old age, was unseasonable and
      premature, since his genius alone could have repaired the last
      and fatal error of his life. The reality, or the suspicion, of a
      conspiracy disarmed and disunited the Italians. The soldiers
      resented the disgrace, and bewailed the loss, of their general.
      They were ignorant of their new exarch; and Longinus was himself
      ignorant of the state of the army and the province. In the
      preceding years Italy had been desolated by pestilence and
      famine, and a disaffected people ascribed the calamities of
      nature to the guilt or folly of their rulers. 17

      Whatever might be the grounds of his security, Alboin neither
      expected nor encountered a Roman army in the field. He ascended
      the Julian Alps, and looked down with contempt and desire on the
      fruitful plains to which his victory communicated the perpetual
      appellation of Lombardy. A faithful chieftain, and a select band,
      were stationed at Forum Julii, the modern Friuli, to guard the
      passes of the mountains. The Lombards respected the strength of
      Pavia, and listened to the prayers of the Trevisans: their slow
      and heavy multitudes proceeded to occupy the palace and city of
      Verona; and Milan, now rising from her ashes, was invested by the
      powers of Alboin five months after his departure from Pannonia.
      Terror preceded his march: he found every where, or he left, a
      dreary solitude; and the pusillanimous Italians presumed, without
      a trial, that the stranger was invincible. Escaping to lakes, or
      rocks, or morasses, the affrighted crowds concealed some
      fragments of their wealth, and delayed the moment of their
      servitude. Paulinus, the patriarch of Aquileia, removed his
      treasures, sacred and profane, to the Isle of Grado, 18 and his
      successors were adopted by the infant republic of Venice, which
      was continually enriched by the public calamities. Honoratus, who
      filled the chair of St. Ambrose, had credulously accepted the
      faithless offers of a capitulation; and the archbishop, with the
      clergy and nobles of Milan, were driven by the perfidy of Alboin
      to seek a refuge in the less accessible ramparts of Genoa. Along
      the maritime coast, the courage of the inhabitants was supported
      by the facility of supply, the hopes of relief, and the power of
      escape; but from the Trentine hills to the gates of Ravenna and
      Rome the inland regions of Italy became, without a battle or a
      siege, the lasting patrimony of the Lombards. The submission of
      the people invited the Barbarian to assume the character of a
      lawful sovereign, and the helpless exarch was confined to the
      office of announcing to the emperor Justin the rapid and
      irretrievable loss of his provinces and cities. 19 One city,
      which had been diligently fortified by the Goths, resisted the
      arms of a new invader; and while Italy was subdued by the flying
      detachments of the Lombards, the royal camp was fixed above three
      years before the western gate of Ticinum, or Pavia. The same
      courage which obtains the esteem of a civilized enemy provokes
      the fury of a savage, and the impatient besieger had bound
      himself by a tremendous oath, that age, and sex, and dignity,
      should be confounded in a general massacre. The aid of famine at
      length enabled him to execute his bloody vow; but, as Alboin
      entered the gate, his horse stumbled, fell, and could not be
      raised from the ground. One of his attendants was prompted by
      compassion, or piety, to interpret this miraculous sign of the
      wrath of Heaven: the conqueror paused and relented; he sheathed
      his sword, and peacefully reposing himself in the palace of
      Theodoric, proclaimed to the trembling multitude that they should
      live and obey. Delighted with the situation of a city which was
      endeared to his pride by the difficulty of the purchase, the
      prince of the Lombards disdained the ancient glories of Milan;
      and Pavia, during some ages, was respected as the capital of the
      kingdom of Italy. 20

      The reign of the founder was splendid and transient; and, before
      he could regulate his new conquests, Alboin fell a sacrifice to
      domestic treason and female revenge. In a palace near Verona,
      which had not been erected for the Barbarians, he feasted the
      companions of his arms; intoxication was the reward of valor, and
      the king himself was tempted by appetite, or vanity, to exceed
      the ordinary measure of his intemperance. After draining many
      capacious bowls of Rhaetian or Falernian wine, he called for the
      skull of Cunimund, the noblest and most precious ornament of his
      sideboard. The cup of victory was accepted with horrid applause
      by the circle of the Lombard chiefs. “Fill it again with wine,”
      exclaimed the inhuman conqueror, “fill it to the brim: carry this
      goblet to the queen, and request in my name that she would
      rejoice with her father.” In an agony of grief and rage, Rosamond
      had strength to utter, “Let the will of my lord be obeyed!” and,
      touching it with her lips, pronounced a silent imprecation, that
      the insult should be washed away in the blood of Alboin. Some
      indulgence might be due to the resentment of a daughter, if she
      had not already violated the duties of a wife. Implacable in her
      enmity, or inconstant in her love, the queen of Italy had stooped
      from the throne to the arms of a subject, and Helmichis, the
      king’s armor-bearer, was the secret minister of her pleasure and
      revenge. Against the proposal of the murder, he could no longer
      urge the scruples of fidelity or gratitude; but Helmichis
      trembled when he revolved the danger as well as the guilt, when
      he recollected the matchless strength and intrepidity of a
      warrior whom he had so often attended in the field of battle. He
      pressed and obtained, that one of the bravest champions of the
      Lombards should be associated to the enterprise; but no more than
      a promise of secrecy could be drawn from the gallant Peredeus,
      and the mode of seduction employed by Rosamond betrays her
      shameless insensibility both to honor and love. She supplied the
      place of one of her female attendants who was beloved by
      Peredeus, and contrived some excuse for darkness and silence,
      till she could inform her companion that he had enjoyed the queen
      of the Lombards, and that his own death, or the death of Alboin,
      must be the consequence of such treasonable adultery. In this
      alternative he chose rather to be the accomplice than the victim
      of Rosamond, 21 whose undaunted spirit was incapable of fear or
      remorse. She expected and soon found a favorable moment, when the
      king, oppressed with wine, had retired from the table to his
      afternoon slumbers. His faithless spouse was anxious for his
      health and repose: the gates of the palace were shut, the arms
      removed, the attendants dismissed, and Rosamond, after lulling
      him to rest by her tender caresses, unbolted the chamber door,
      and urged the reluctant conspirators to the instant execution of
      the deed. On the first alarm, the warrior started from his couch:
      his sword, which he attempted to draw, had been fastened to the
      scabbard by the hand of Rosamond; and a small stool, his only
      weapon, could not long protect him from the spears of the
      assassins. The daughter of Cunimund smiled in his fall: his body
      was buried under the staircase of the palace; and the grateful
      posterity of the Lombards revered the tomb and the memory of
      their victorious leader.

      Chapter XLV: State Of Italy Under The Lombards.—Part II.

      The ambitious Rosamond aspired to reign in the name of her lover;
      the city and palace of Verona were awed by her power; and a
      faithful band of her native Gepidae was prepared to applaud the
      revenge, and to second the wishes, of their sovereign. But the
      Lombard chiefs, who fled in the first moments of consternation
      and disorder, had resumed their courage and collected their
      powers; and the nation, instead of submitting to her reign,
      demanded, with unanimous cries, that justice should be executed
      on the guilty spouse and the murderers of their king. She sought
      a refuge among the enemies of her country; and a criminal who
      deserved the abhorrence of mankind was protected by the selfish
      policy of the exarch. With her daughter, the heiress of the
      Lombard throne, her two lovers, her trusty Gepidae, and the
      spoils of the palace of Verona, Rosamond descended the Adige and
      the Po, and was transported by a Greek vessel to the safe harbor
      of Ravenna. Longinus beheld with delight the charms and the
      treasures of the widow of Alboin: her situation and her past
      conduct might justify the most licentious proposals; and she
      readily listened to the passion of a minister, who, even in the
      decline of the empire, was respected as the equal of kings. The
      death of a jealous lover was an easy and grateful sacrifice; and,
      as Helmichis issued from the bath, he received the deadly potion
      from the hand of his mistress. The taste of the liquor, its
      speedy operation, and his experience of the character of
      Rosamond, convinced him that he was poisoned: he pointed his
      dagger to her breast, compelled her to drain the remainder of the
      cup, and expired in a few minutes, with the consolation that she
      could not survive to enjoy the fruits of her wickedness. The
      daughter of Alboin and Rosamond, with the richest spoils of the
      Lombards, was embarked for Constantinople: the surprising
      strength of Peredeus amused and terrified the Imperial court:
      2111 his blindness and revenge exhibited an imperfect copy of the
      adventures of Samson. By the free suffrage of the nation, in the
      assembly of Pavia, Clepho, one of their noblest chiefs, was
      elected as the successor of Alboin. Before the end of eighteen
      months, the throne was polluted by a second murder: Clepho was
      stabbed by the hand of a domestic; the regal office was suspended
      above ten years during the minority of his son Autharis; and
      Italy was divided and oppressed by a ducal aristocracy of thirty
      tyrants. 22

      Of all chronological guides, Muratori is the safest.]

      When the nephew of Justinian ascended the throne, he proclaimed a
      new aera of happiness and glory. The annals of the second Justin
      23 are marked with disgrace abroad and misery at home. In the
      West, the Roman empire was afflicted by the loss of Italy, the
      desolation of Africa, and the conquests of the Persians.
      Injustice prevailed both in the capital and the provinces: the
      rich trembled for their property, the poor for their safety, the
      ordinary magistrates were ignorant or venal, the occasional
      remedies appear to have been arbitrary and violent, and the
      complaints of the people could no longer be silenced by the
      splendid names of a legislator and a conqueror. The opinion which
      imputes to the prince all the calamities of his times may be
      countenanced by the historian as a serious truth or a salutary
      prejudice. Yet a candid suspicion will arise, that the sentiments
      of Justin were pure and benevolent, and that he might have filled
      his station without reproach, if the faculties of his mind had
      not been impaired by disease, which deprived the emperor of the
      use of his feet, and confined him to the palace, a stranger to
      the complaints of the people and the vices of the government. The
      tardy knowledge of his own impotence determined him to lay down
      the weight of the diadem; and, in the choice of a worthy
      substitute, he showed some symptoms of a discerning and even
      magnanimous spirit. The only son of Justin and Sophia died in his
      infancy; their daughter Arabia was the wife of Baduarius, 24
      superintendent of the palace, and afterwards commander of the
      Italian armies, who vainly aspired to confirm the rights of
      marriage by those of adoption. While the empire appeared an
      object of desire, Justin was accustomed to behold with jealousy
      and hatred his brothers and cousins, the rivals of his hopes; nor
      could he depend on the gratitude of those who would accept the
      purple as a restitution, rather than a gift. Of these
      competitors, one had been removed by exile, and afterwards by
      death; and the emperor himself had inflicted such cruel insults
      on another, that he must either dread his resentment or despise
      his patience. This domestic animosity was refined into a generous
      resolution of seeking a successor, not in his family, but in the
      republic; and the artful Sophia recommended Tiberius, 25 his
      faithful captain of the guards, whose virtues and fortune the
      emperor might cherish as the fruit of his judicious choice. The
      ceremony of his elevation to the rank of Caesar, or Augustus, was
      performed in the portico of the palace, in the presence of the
      patriarch and the senate. Justin collected the remaining strength
      of his mind and body; but the popular belief that his speech was
      inspired by the Deity betrays a very humble opinion both of the
      man and of the times. 26 “You behold,” said the emperor, “the
      ensigns of supreme power. You are about to receive them, not from
      my hand, but from the hand of God. Honor them, and from them you
      will derive honor. Respect the empress your mother: you are now
      her son; before, you were her servant. Delight not in blood;
      abstain from revenge; avoid those actions by which I have
      incurred the public hatred; and consult the experience, rather
      than the example, of your predecessor. As a man, I have sinned;
      as a sinner, even in this life, I have been severely punished:
      but these servants, (and he pointed to his ministers,) who have
      abused my confidence, and inflamed my passions, will appear with
      me before the tribunal of Christ. I have been dazzled by the
      splendor of the diadem: be thou wise and modest; remember what
      you have been, remember what you are. You see around us your
      slaves, and your children: with the authority, assume the
      tenderness, of a parent. Love your people like yourself;
      cultivate the affections, maintain the discipline, of the army;
      protect the fortunes of the rich, relieve the necessities of the
      poor.” 27 The assembly, in silence and in tears, applauded the
      counsels, and sympathized with the repentance, of their prince
      the patriarch rehearsed the prayers of the church; Tiberius
      received the diadem on his knees; and Justin, who in his
      abdication appeared most worthy to reign, addressed the new
      monarch in the following words: “If you consent, I live; if you
      command, I die: may the God of heaven and earth infuse into your
      heart whatever I have neglected or forgotten.” The four last
      years of the emperor Justin were passed in tranquil obscurity:
      his conscience was no longer tormented by the remembrance of
      those duties which he was incapable of discharging; and his
      choice was justified by the filial reverence and gratitude of
      Tiberius.

      incapable of producing such sentiments.]

      Among the virtues of Tiberius, 28 his beauty (he was one of the
      tallest and most comely of the Romans) might introduce him to the
      favor of Sophia; and the widow of Justin was persuaded, that she
      should preserve her station and influence under the reign of a
      second and more youthful husband. But, if the ambitious candidate
      had been tempted to flatter and dissemble, it was no longer in
      his power to fulfil her expectations, or his own promise. The
      factions of the hippodrome demanded, with some impatience, the
      name of their new empress: both the people and Sophia were
      astonished by the proclamation of Anastasia, the secret, though
      lawful, wife of the emperor Tiberius. Whatever could alleviate
      the disappointment of Sophia, Imperial honors, a stately palace,
      a numerous household, was liberally bestowed by the piety of her
      adopted son; on solemn occasions he attended and consulted the
      widow of his benefactor; but her ambition disdained the vain
      semblance of royalty, and the respectful appellation of mother
      served to exasperate, rather than appease, the rage of an injured
      woman. While she accepted, and repaid with a courtly smile, the
      fair expressions of regard and confidence, a secret alliance was
      concluded between the dowager empress and her ancient enemies;
      and Justinian, the son of Germanus, was employed as the
      instrument of her revenge. The pride of the reigning house
      supported, with reluctance, the dominion of a stranger: the youth
      was deservedly popular; his name, after the death of Justin, had
      been mentioned by a tumultuous faction; and his own submissive
      offer of his head with a treasure of sixty thousand pounds, might
      be interpreted as an evidence of guilt, or at least of fear.
      Justinian received a free pardon, and the command of the eastern
      army. The Persian monarch fled before his arms; and the
      acclamations which accompanied his triumph declared him worthy of
      the purple. His artful patroness had chosen the month of the
      vintage, while the emperor, in a rural solitude, was permitted to
      enjoy the pleasures of a subject. On the first intelligence of
      her designs, he returned to Constantinople, and the conspiracy
      was suppressed by his presence and firmness. From the pomp and
      honors which she had abused, Sophia was reduced to a modest
      allowance: Tiberius dismissed her train, intercepted her
      correspondence, and committed to a faithful guard the custody of
      her person. But the services of Justinian were not considered by
      that excellent prince as an aggravation of his offences: after a
      mild reproof, his treason and ingratitude were forgiven; and it
      was commonly believed, that the emperor entertained some thoughts
      of contracting a double alliance with the rival of his throne.
      The voice of an angel (such a fable was propagated) might reveal
      to the emperor, that he should always triumph over his domestic
      foes; but Tiberius derived a firmer assurance from the innocence
      and generosity of his own mind.

      With the odious name of Tiberius, he assumed the more popular
      appellation of Constantine, and imitated the purer virtues of the
      Antonines. After recording the vice or folly of so many Roman
      princes, it is pleasing to repose, for a moment, on a character
      conspicuous by the qualities of humanity, justice, temperance,
      and fortitude; to contemplate a sovereign affable in his palace,
      pious in the church, impartial on the seat of judgment, and
      victorious, at least by his generals, in the Persian war. The
      most glorious trophy of his victory consisted in a multitude of
      captives, whom Tiberius entertained, redeemed, and dismissed to
      their native homes with the charitable spirit of a Christian
      hero. The merit or misfortunes of his own subjects had a dearer
      claim to his beneficence, and he measured his bounty not so much
      by their expectations as by his own dignity. This maxim, however
      dangerous in a trustee of the public wealth, was balanced by a
      principle of humanity and justice, which taught him to abhor, as
      of the basest alloy, the gold that was extracted from the tears
      of the people. For their relief, as often as they had suffered by
      natural or hostile calamities, he was impatient to remit the
      arrears of the past, or the demands of future taxes: he sternly
      rejected the servile offerings of his ministers, which were
      compensated by tenfold oppression; and the wise and equitable
      laws of Tiberius excited the praise and regret of succeeding
      times. Constantinople believed that the emperor had discovered a
      treasure: but his genuine treasure consisted in the practice of
      liberal economy, and the contempt of all vain and superfluous
      expense. The Romans of the East would have been happy, if the
      best gift of Heaven, a patriot king, had been confirmed as a
      proper and permanent blessing. But in less than four years after
      the death of Justin, his worthy successor sunk into a mortal
      disease, which left him only sufficient time to restore the
      diadem, according to the tenure by which he held it, to the most
      deserving of his fellow-citizens. He selected Maurice from the
      crowd, a judgment more precious than the purple itself: the
      patriarch and senate were summoned to the bed of the dying
      prince: he bestowed his daughter and the empire; and his last
      advice was solemnly delivered by the voice of the quaestor.
      Tiberius expressed his hope that the virtues of his son and
      successor would erect the noblest mausoleum to his memory. His
      memory was embalmed by the public affliction; but the most
      sincere grief evaporates in the tumult of a new reign, and the
      eyes and acclamations of mankind were speedily directed to the
      rising sun. The emperor Maurice derived his origin from ancient
      Rome; 29 but his immediate parents were settled at Arabissus in
      Cappadocia, and their singular felicity preserved them alive to
      behold and partake the fortune of their august son. The youth of
      Maurice was spent in the profession of arms: Tiberius promoted
      him to the command of a new and favorite legion of twelve
      thousand confederates; his valor and conduct were signalized in
      the Persian war; and he returned to Constantinople to accept, as
      his just reward, the inheritance of the empire. Maurice ascended
      the throne at the mature age of forty-three years; and he reigned
      above twenty years over the East and over himself; 30 expelling
      from his mind the wild democracy of passions, and establishing
      (according to the quaint expression of Evagrius) a perfect
      aristocracy of reason and virtue. Some suspicion will degrade the
      testimony of a subject, though he protests that his secret praise
      should never reach the ear of his sovereign, 31 and some failings
      seem to place the character of Maurice below the purer merit of
      his predecessor. His cold and reserved demeanor might be imputed
      to arrogance; his justice was not always exempt from cruelty, nor
      his clemency from weakness; and his rigid economy too often
      exposed him to the reproach of avarice. But the rational wishes
      of an absolute monarch must tend to the happiness of his people.
      Maurice was endowed with sense and courage to promote that
      happiness, and his administration was directed by the principles
      and example of Tiberius. The pusillanimity of the Greeks had
      introduced so complete a separation between the offices of king
      and of general, that a private soldier, who had deserved and
      obtained the purple, seldom or never appeared at the head of his
      armies. Yet the emperor Maurice enjoyed the glory of restoring
      the Persian monarch to his throne; his lieutenants waged a
      doubtful war against the Avars of the Danube; and he cast an eye
      of pity, of ineffectual pity, on the abject and distressful state
      of his Italian provinces.

      Europe: and a various reading, in Graecorum Imperio, would apply

      31 (return) [ Evagrius composed his history in the twelfth year
      of Maurice; and he had been so wisely indiscreet that the emperor
      know and rewarded his favorable opinion, (l. vi. c. 24.)]

      From Italy the emperors were incessantly tormented by tales of
      misery and demands of succor, which extorted the humiliating
      confession of their own weakness. The expiring dignity of Rome
      was only marked by the freedom and energy of her complaints: “If
      you are incapable,” she said, “of delivering us from the sword of
      the Lombards, save us at least from the calamity of famine.”
      Tiberius forgave the reproach, and relieved the distress: a
      supply of corn was transported from Egypt to the Tyber; and the
      Roman people, invoking the name, not of Camillus, but of St.
      Peter repulsed the Barbarians from their walls. But the relief
      was accidental, the danger was perpetual and pressing; and the
      clergy and senate, collecting the remains of their ancient
      opulence, a sum of three thousand pounds of gold, despatched the
      patrician Pamphronius to lay their gifts and their complaints at
      the foot of the Byzantine throne. The attention of the court, and
      the forces of the East, were diverted by the Persian war: but the
      justice of Tiberius applied the subsidy to the defence of the
      city; and he dismissed the patrician with his best advice, either
      to bribe the Lombard chiefs, or to purchase the aid of the kings
      of France. Notwithstanding this weak invention, Italy was still
      afflicted, Rome was again besieged, and the suburb of Classe,
      only three miles from Ravenna, was pillaged and occupied by the
      troops of a simple duke of Spoleto. Maurice gave audience to a
      second deputation of priests and senators: the duties and the
      menaces of religion were forcibly urged in the letters of the
      Roman pontiff; and his nuncio, the deacon Gregory, was alike
      qualified to solicit the powers either of heaven or of the earth.

      The emperor adopted, with stronger effect, the measures of his
      predecessor: some formidable chiefs were persuaded to embrace the
      friendship of the Romans; and one of them, a mild and faithful
      Barbarian, lived and died in the service of the exarchs: the
      passes of the Alps were delivered to the Franks; and the pope
      encouraged them to violate, without scruple, their oaths and
      engagements to the misbelievers. Childebert, the great-grandson
      of Clovis, was persuaded to invade Italy by the payment of fifty
      thousand pieces; but, as he had viewed with delight some
      Byzantine coin of the weight of one pound of gold, the king of
      Austrasia might stipulate, that the gift should be rendered more
      worthy of his acceptance, by a proper mixture of these
      respectable medals. The dukes of the Lombards had provoked by
      frequent inroads their powerful neighbors of Gaul. As soon as
      they were apprehensive of a just retaliation, they renounced
      their feeble and disorderly independence: the advantages of real
      government, union, secrecy, and vigor, were unanimously
      confessed; and Autharis, the son of Clepho, had already attained
      the strength and reputation of a warrior. Under the standard of
      their new king, the conquerors of Italy withstood three
      successive invasions, one of which was led by Childebert himself,
      the last of the Merovingian race who descended from the Alps. The
      first expedition was defeated by the jealous animosity of the
      Franks and Alemanni. In the second they were vanquished in a
      bloody battle, with more loss and dishonor than they had
      sustained since the foundation of their monarchy. Impatient for
      revenge, they returned a third time with accumulated force, and
      Autharis yielded to the fury of the torrent. The troops and
      treasures of the Lombards were distributed in the walled towns
      between the Alps and the Apennine. A nation, less sensible of
      danger than of fatigue and delay, soon murmured against the folly
      of their twenty commanders; and the hot vapors of an Italian sun
      infected with disease those tramontane bodies which had already
      suffered the vicissitudes of intemperance and famine. The powers
      that were inadequate to the conquest, were more than sufficient
      for the desolation, of the country; nor could the trembling
      natives distinguish between their enemies and their deliverers.
      If the junction of the Merovingian and Imperial forces had been
      effected in the neighborhood of Milan, perhaps they might have
      subverted the throne of the Lombards; but the Franks expected six
      days the signal of a flaming village, and the arms of the Greeks
      were idly employed in the reduction of Modena and Parma, which
      were torn from them after the retreat of their transalpine
      allies. The victorious Autharis asserted his claim to the
      dominion of Italy. At the foot of the Rhaetian Alps, he subdued
      the resistance, and rifled the hidden treasures, of a sequestered
      island in the Lake of Comum. At the extreme point of the
      Calabria, he touched with his spear a column on the sea-shore of
      Rhegium, 32 proclaiming that ancient landmark to stand the
      immovable boundary of his kingdom. 33

      During a period of two hundred years, Italy was unequally divided
      between the kingdom of the Lombards and the exarchate of Ravenna.
      The offices and professions, which the jealousy of Constantine
      had separated, were united by the indulgence of Justinian; and
      eighteen successive exarchs were invested, in the decline of the
      empire, with the full remains of civil, of military, and even of
      ecclesiastical, power. Their immediate jurisdiction, which was
      afterwards consecrated as the patrimony of St. Peter, extended
      over the modern Romagna, the marshes or valleys of Ferrara and
      Commachio, 34 five maritime cities from Rimini to Ancona, and a
      second inland Pentapolis, between the Adriatic coast and the
      hills of the Apennine. Three subordinate provinces, of Rome, of
      Venice, and of Naples, which were divided by hostile lands from
      the palace of Ravenna, acknowledged, both in peace and war, the
      supremacy of the exarch. The duchy of Rome appears to have
      included the Tuscan, Sabine, and Latin conquests, of the first
      four hundred years of the city, and the limits may be distinctly
      traced along the coast, from Civita Vecchia to Terracina, and
      with the course of the Tyber from Ameria and Narni to the port of
      Ostia. The numerous islands from Grado to Chiozza composed the
      infant dominion of Venice: but the more accessible towns on the
      Continent were overthrown by the Lombards, who beheld with
      impotent fury a new capital rising from the waves. The power of
      the dukes of Naples was circumscribed by the bay and the adjacent
      isles, by the hostile territory of Capua, and by the Roman colony
      of Amalphi, 35 whose industrious citizens, by the invention of
      the mariner’s compass, have unveiled the face of the globe. The
      three islands of Sardinia, Corsica, and Sicily, still adhered to
      the empire; and the acquisition of the farther Calabria removed
      the landmark of Autharis from the shore of Rhegium to the Isthmus
      of Consentia. In Sardinia, the savage mountaineers preserved the
      liberty and religion of their ancestors; and the husbandmen of
      Sicily were chained to their rich and cultivated soil. Rome was
      oppressed by the iron sceptre of the exarchs, and a Greek,
      perhaps a eunuch, insulted with impunity the ruins of the
      Capitol. But Naples soon acquired the privilege of electing her
      own dukes: 36 the independence of Amalphi was the fruit of
      commerce; and the voluntary attachment of Venice was finally
      ennobled by an equal alliance with the Eastern empire. On the map
      of Italy, the measure of the exarchate occupies a very inadequate
      space, but it included an ample proportion of wealth, industry,
      and population. The most faithful and valuable subjects escaped
      from the Barbarian yoke; and the banners of Pavia and Verona, of
      Milan and Padua, were displayed in their respective quarters by
      the new inhabitants of Ravenna. The remainder of Italy was
      possessed by the Lombards; and from Pavia, the royal seat, their
      kingdom was extended to the east, the north, and the west, as far
      as the confines of the Avars, the Bavarians, and the Franks of
      Austrasia and Burgundy. In the language of modern geography, it
      is now represented by the Terra Firma of the Venetian republic,
      Tyrol, the Milanese, Piedmont, the coast of Genoa, Mantua, Parma,
      and Modena, the grand duchy of Tuscany, and a large portion of
      the ecclesiastical state from Perugia to the Adriatic. The dukes,
      and at length the princes, of Beneventum, survived the monarchy,
      and propagated the name of the Lombards. From Capua to Tarentum,
      they reigned near five hundred years over the greatest part of
      the present kingdom of Naples. 37

      doubtful and obscure Even Muratori, as the servant of the house
      of Este, is not free from partiality and prejudice.]

      excellent Dissertation of Beretti. Giannone (Istoria Civile, tom.
      i. p. 374—387) has followed the learned Camillo Pellegrini in the
      geography of the kingdom of Naples. After the loss of the true
      Calabria, the vanity of the Greeks substituted that name instead
      of the more ignoble appellation of Bruttium; and the change
      appears to have taken place before the time of Charlemagne,
      (Eginard, p. 75.)]

      In comparing the proportion of the victorious and the vanquished
      people, the change of language will afford the most probably
      inference. According to this standard, it will appear, that the
      Lombards of Italy, and the Visigoths of Spain, were less numerous
      than the Franks or Burgundians; and the conquerors of Gaul must
      yield, in their turn, to the multitude of Saxons and Angles who
      almost eradicated the idioms of Britain. The modern Italian has
      been insensibly formed by the mixture of nations: the awkwardness
      of the Barbarians in the nice management of declensions and
      conjugations reduced them to the use of articles and auxiliary
      verbs; and many new ideas have been expressed by Teutonic
      appellations. Yet the principal stock of technical and familiar
      words is found to be of Latin derivation; 38 and, if we were
      sufficiently conversant with the obsolete, the rustic, and the
      municipal dialects of ancient Italy, we should trace the origin
      of many terms which might, perhaps, be rejected by the classic
      purity of Rome. A numerous army constitutes but a small nation,
      and the powers of the Lombards were soon diminished by the
      retreat of twenty thousand Saxons, who scorned a dependent
      situation, and returned, after many bold and perilous adventures,
      to their native country. 39 The camp of Alboin was of formidable
      extent, but the extent of a camp would be easily circumscribed
      within the limits of a city; and its martial inhabitants must be
      thinly scattered over the face of a large country. When Alboin
      descended from the Alps, he invested his nephew, the first duke
      of Friuli, with the command of the province and the people: but
      the prudent Gisulf would have declined the dangerous office,
      unless he had been permitted to choose, among the nobles of the
      Lombards, a sufficient number of families 40 to form a perpetual
      colony of soldiers and subjects. In the progress of conquest, the
      same option could not be granted to the dukes of Brescia or
      Bergamo, or Pavia or Turin, of Spoleto or Beneventum; but each of
      these, and each of their colleagues, settled in his appointed
      district with a band of followers who resorted to his standard in
      war and his tribunal in peace. Their attachment was free and
      honorable: resigning the gifts and benefits which they had
      accepted, they might emigrate with their families into the
      jurisdiction of another duke; but their absence from the kingdom
      was punished with death, as a crime of military desertion. 41 The
      posterity of the first conquerors struck a deeper root into the
      soil, which, by every motive of interest and honor, they were
      bound to defend. A Lombard was born the soldier of his king and
      his duke; and the civil assemblies of the nation displayed the
      banners, and assumed the appellation, of a regular army. Of this
      army, the pay and the rewards were drawn from the conquered
      provinces; and the distribution, which was not effected till
      after the death of Alboin, is disgraced by the foul marks of
      injustice and rapine. Many of the most wealthy Italians were
      slain or banished; the remainder were divided among the
      strangers, and a tributary obligation was imposed (under the name
      of hospitality) of paying to the Lombards a third part of the
      fruits of the earth. Within less than seventy years, this
      artificial system was abolished by a more simple and solid
      tenure. 42 Either the Roman landlord was expelled by his strong
      and insolent guest, or the annual payment, a third of the
      produce, was exchanged by a more equitable transaction for an
      adequate proportion of landed property. Under these foreign
      masters, the business of agriculture, in the cultivation of corn,
      wines, and olives, was exercised with degenerate skill and
      industry by the labor of the slaves and natives. But the
      occupations of a pastoral life were more pleasing to the idleness
      of the Barbarian. In the rich meadows of Venetia, they restored
      and improved the breed of horses, for which that province had
      once been illustrious; 43 and the Italians beheld with
      astonishment a foreign race of oxen or buffaloes. 44 The
      depopulation of Lombardy, and the increase of forests, afforded
      an ample range for the pleasures of the chase. 45 That marvellous
      art which teaches the birds of the air to acknowledge the voice,
      and execute the commands, of their master, had been unknown to
      the ingenuity of the Greeks and Romans. 46 Scandinavia and
      Scythia produce the boldest and most tractable falcons: 47 they
      were tamed and educated by the roving inhabitants, always on
      horseback and in the field. This favorite amusement of our
      ancestors was introduced by the Barbarians into the Roman
      provinces; and the laws of Italy esteemed the sword and the hawk
      as of equal dignity and importance in the hands of a noble
      Lombard. 48

      Chapter XLV: State Of Italy Under The Lombards.—Part III.

      So rapid was the influence of climate and example, that the
      Lombards of the fourth generation surveyed with curiosity and
      affright the portraits of their savage forefathers. 49 Their
      heads were shaven behind, but the shaggy locks hung over their
      eyes and mouth, and a long beard represented the name and
      character of the nation. Their dress consisted of loose linen
      garments, after the fashion of the Anglo-Saxons, which were
      decorated, in their opinion, with broad stripes or variegated
      colors. The legs and feet were clothed in long hose, and open
      sandals; and even in the security of peace a trusty sword was
      constantly girt to their side. Yet this strange apparel, and
      horrid aspect, often concealed a gentle and generous disposition;
      and as soon as the rage of battle had subsided, the captives and
      subjects were sometimes surprised by the humanity of the victor.
      The vices of the Lombards were the effect of passion, of
      ignorance, of intoxication; their virtues are the more laudable,
      as they were not affected by the hypocrisy of social manners, nor
      imposed by the rigid constraint of laws and education. I should
      not be apprehensive of deviating from my subject, if it were in
      my power to delineate the private life of the conquerors of
      Italy; and I shall relate with pleasure the adventurous gallantry
      of Autharis, which breathes the true spirit of chivalry and
      romance. 50 After the loss of his promised bride, a Merovingian
      princess, he sought in marriage the daughter of the king of
      Bavaria; and Garribald accepted the alliance of the Italian
      monarch. Impatient of the slow progress of negotiation, the
      ardent lover escaped from his palace, and visited the court of
      Bavaria in the train of his own embassy. At the public audience,
      the unknown stranger advanced to the throne, and informed
      Garribald that the ambassador was indeed the minister of state,
      but that he alone was the friend of Autharis, who had trusted him
      with the delicate commission of making a faithful report of the
      charms of his spouse. Theudelinda was summoned to undergo this
      important examination; and, after a pause of silent rapture, he
      hailed her as the queen of Italy, and humbly requested that,
      according to the custom of the nation, she would present a cup of
      wine to the first of her new subjects. By the command of her
      father she obeyed: Autharis received the cup in his turn, and, in
      restoring it to the princess, he secretly touched her hand, and
      drew his own finger over his face and lips. In the evening,
      Theudelinda imparted to her nurse the indiscreet familiarity of
      the stranger, and was comforted by the assurance, that such
      boldness could proceed only from the king her husband, who, by
      his beauty and courage, appeared worthy of her love. The
      ambassadors were dismissed: no sooner did they reach the confines
      of Italy than Autharis, raising himself on his horse, darted his
      battle-axe against a tree with incomparable strength and
      dexterity. “Such,” said he to the astonished Bavarians, “such are
      the strokes of the king of the Lombards.” On the approach of a
      French army, Garribald and his daughter took refuge in the
      dominions of their ally; and the marriage was consummated in the
      palace of Verona. At the end of one year, it was dissolved by the
      death of Autharis: but the virtues of Theudelinda 51 had endeared
      her to the nation, and she was permitted to bestow, with her
      hand, the sceptre of the Italian kingdom.

      the pious queen Theudelinda to the arms of a muleteer.]

      From this fact, as well as from similar events, 52 it is certain
      that the Lombards possessed freedom to elect their sovereign, and
      sense to decline the frequent use of that dangerous privilege.
      The public revenue arose from the produce of land and the profits
      of justice. When the independent dukes agreed that Autharis
      should ascend the throne of his father, they endowed the regal
      office with a fair moiety of their respective domains. The
      proudest nobles aspired to the honors of servitude near the
      person of their prince: he rewarded the fidelity of his vassals
      by the precarious gift of pensions and benefices; and atoned for
      the injuries of war by the rich foundation of monasteries and
      churches. In peace a judge, a leader in war, he never usurped the
      powers of a sole and absolute legislator. The king of Italy
      convened the national assemblies in the palace, or more probably
      in the fields, of Pavia: his great council was composed of the
      persons most eminent by their birth and dignities; but the
      validity, as well as the execution, of their decrees depended on
      the approbation of the faithful people, the fortunate army of the
      Lombards. About fourscore years after the conquest of Italy,
      their traditional customs were transcribed in Teutonic Latin, 53
      and ratified by the consent of the prince and people: some new
      regulations were introduced, more suitable to their present
      condition; the example of Rotharis was imitated by the wisest of
      his successors; and the laws of the Lombards have been esteemed
      the least imperfect of the Barbaric codes. 54 Secure by their
      courage in the possession of liberty, these rude and hasty
      legislators were incapable of balancing the powers of the
      constitution, or of discussing the nice theory of political
      government. Such crimes as threatened the life of the sovereign,
      or the safety of the state, were adjudged worthy of death; but
      their attention was principally confined to the defence of the
      person and property of the subject. According to the strange
      jurisprudence of the times, the guilt of blood might be redeemed
      by a fine; yet the high price of nine hundred pieces of gold
      declares a just sense of the value of a simple citizen. Less
      atrocious injuries, a wound, a fracture, a blow, an opprobrious
      word, were measured with scrupulous and almost ridiculous
      diligence; and the prudence of the legislator encouraged the
      ignoble practice of bartering honor and revenge for a pecuniary
      compensation. The ignorance of the Lombards in the state of
      Paganism or Christianity gave implicit credit to the malice and
      mischief of witchcraft, but the judges of the seventeenth century
      might have been instructed and confounded by the wisdom of
      Rotharis, who derides the absurd superstition, and protects the
      wretched victims of popular or judicial cruelty. 55 The same
      spirit of a legislator, superior to his age and country, may be
      ascribed to Luitprand, who condemns, while he tolerates, the
      impious and inveterate abuse of duels, 56 observing, from his own
      experience, that the juster cause had often been oppressed by
      successful violence. Whatever merit may be discovered in the laws
      of the Lombards, they are the genuine fruit of the reason of the
      Barbarians, who never admitted the bishops of Italy to a seat in
      their legislative councils. But the succession of their kings is
      marked with virtue and ability; the troubled series of their
      annals is adorned with fair intervals of peace, order, and
      domestic happiness; and the Italians enjoyed a milder and more
      equitable government, than any of the other kingdoms which had
      been founded on the ruins of the Western empire. 57

      Amidst the arms of the Lombards, and under the despotism of the
      Greeks, we again inquire into the fate of Rome, 58 which had
      reached, about the close of the sixth century, the lowest period
      of her depression. By the removal of the seat of empire, and the
      successive loss of the provinces, the sources of public and
      private opulence were exhausted: the lofty tree, under whose
      shade the nations of the earth had reposed, was deprived of its
      leaves and branches, and the sapless trunk was left to wither on
      the ground. The ministers of command, and the messengers of
      victory, no longer met on the Appian or Flaminian way; and the
      hostile approach of the Lombards was often felt, and continually
      feared. The inhabitants of a potent and peaceful capital, who
      visit without an anxious thought the garden of the adjacent
      country, will faintly picture in their fancy the distress of the
      Romans: they shut or opened their gates with a trembling hand,
      beheld from the walls the flames of their houses, and heard the
      lamentations of their brethren, who were coupled together like
      dogs, and dragged away into distant slavery beyond the sea and
      the mountains. Such incessant alarms must annihilate the
      pleasures and interrupt the labors of a rural life; and the
      Campagna of Rome was speedily reduced to the state of a dreary
      wilderness, in which the land is barren, the waters are impure,
      and the air is infectious. Curiosity and ambition no longer
      attracted the nations to the capital of the world: but, if chance
      or necessity directed the steps of a wandering stranger, he
      contemplated with horror the vacancy and solitude of the city,
      and might be tempted to ask, Where is the senate, and where are
      the people? In a season of excessive rains, the Tyber swelled
      above its banks, and rushed with irresistible violence into the
      valleys of the seven hills. A pestilential disease arose from the
      stagnation of the deluge, and so rapid was the contagion, that
      fourscore persons expired in an hour in the midst of a solemn
      procession, which implored the mercy of Heaven. 59 A society in
      which marriage is encouraged and industry prevails soon repairs
      the accidental losses of pestilence and war: but, as the far
      greater part of the Romans was condemned to hopeless indigence
      and celibacy, the depopulation was constant and visible, and the
      gloomy enthusiasts might expect the approaching failure of the
      human race. 60 Yet the number of citizens still exceeded the
      measure of subsistence: their precarious food was supplied from
      the harvests of Sicily or Egypt; and the frequent repetition of
      famine betrays the inattention of the emperor to a distant
      province. The edifices of Rome were exposed to the same ruin and
      decay: the mouldering fabrics were easily overthrown by
      inundations, tempests, and earthquakes: and the monks, who had
      occupied the most advantageous stations, exulted in their base
      triumph over the ruins of antiquity. 61 It is commonly believed,
      that Pope Gregory the First attacked the temples and mutilated
      the statues of the city; that, by the command of the Barbarian,
      the Palatine library was reduced to ashes, and that the history
      of Livy was the peculiar mark of his absurd and mischievous
      fanaticism. The writings of Gregory himself reveal his implacable
      aversion to the monuments of classic genius; and he points his
      severest censure against the profane learning of a bishop, who
      taught the art of grammar, studied the Latin poets, and
      pronounced with the same voice the praises of Jupiter and those
      of Christ. But the evidence of his destructive rage is doubtful
      and recent: the Temple of Peace, or the theatre of Marcellus,
      have been demolished by the slow operation of ages, and a formal
      proscription would have multiplied the copies of Virgil and Livy
      in the countries which were not subject to the ecclesiastical
      dictator. 62

      Like Thebes, or Babylon, or Carthage, the names of Rome might
      have been erased from the earth, if the city had not been
      animated by a vital principle, which again restored her to honor
      and dominion. A vague tradition was embraced, that two Jewish
      teachers, a tent-maker and a fisherman, had formerly been
      executed in the circus of Nero, and at the end of five hundred
      years, their genuine or fictitious relics were adored as the
      Palladium of Christian Rome. The pilgrims of the East and West
      resorted to the holy threshold; but the shrines of the apostles
      were guarded by miracles and invisible terrors; and it was not
      without fear that the pious Catholic approached the object of his
      worship. It was fatal to touch, it was dangerous to behold, the
      bodies of the saints; and those who, from the purest motives,
      presumed to disturb the repose of the sanctuary, were affrighted
      by visions, or punished with sudden death. The unreasonable
      request of an empress, who wished to deprive the Romans of their
      sacred treasure, the head of St. Paul, was rejected with the
      deepest abhorrence; and the pope asserted, most probably with
      truth, that a linen which had been sanctified in the neighborhood
      of his body, or the filings of his chain, which it was sometimes
      easy and sometimes impossible to obtain, possessed an equal
      degree of miraculous virtue. 63 But the power as well as virtue
      of the apostles resided with living energy in the breast of their
      successors; and the chair of St. Peter was filled under the reign
      of Maurice by the first and greatest of the name of Gregory. 64
      His grandfather Felix had himself been pope, and as the bishops
      were already bound by the laws of celibacy, his consecration must
      have been preceded by the death of his wife. The parents of
      Gregory, Sylvia, and Gordian, were the noblest of the senate, and
      the most pious of the church of Rome; his female relations were
      numbered among the saints and virgins; and his own figure, with
      those of his father and mother, were represented near three
      hundred years in a family portrait, 65 which he offered to the
      monastery of St. Andrew. The design and coloring of this picture
      afford an honorable testimony that the art of painting was
      cultivated by the Italians of the sixth century; but the most
      abject ideas must be entertained of their taste and learning,
      since the epistles of Gregory, his sermons, and his dialogues,
      are the work of a man who was second in erudition to none of his
      contemporaries: 66 his birth and abilities had raised him to the
      office of praefect of the city, and he enjoyed the merit of
      renouncing the pomps and vanities of this world. His ample
      patrimony was dedicated to the foundation of seven monasteries,
      67 one in Rome, 68 and six in Sicily; and it was the wish of
      Gregory that he might be unknown in this life, and glorious only
      in the next. Yet his devotion (and it might be sincere) pursued
      the path which would have been chosen by a crafty and ambitious
      statesman. The talents of Gregory, and the splendor which
      accompanied his retreat, rendered him dear and useful to the
      church; and implicit obedience has always been inculcated as the
      first duty of a monk. As soon as he had received the character of
      deacon, Gregory was sent to reside at the Byzantine court, the
      nuncio or minister of the apostolic see; and he boldly assumed,
      in the name of St. Peter, a tone of independent dignity, which
      would have been criminal and dangerous in the most illustrious
      layman of the empire. He returned to Rome with a just increase of
      reputation, and, after a short exercise of the monastic virtues,
      he was dragged from the cloister to the papal throne, by the
      unanimous voice of the clergy, the senate, and the people. He
      alone resisted, or seemed to resist, his own elevation; and his
      humble petition, that Maurice would be pleased to reject the
      choice of the Romans, could only serve to exalt his character in
      the eyes of the emperor and the public. When the fatal mandate
      was proclaimed, Gregory solicited the aid of some friendly
      merchants to convey him in a basket beyond the gates of Rome, and
      modestly concealed himself some days among the woods and
      mountains, till his retreat was discovered, as it is said, by a
      celestial light.

      pontifical smith who handled the file must have understood the

      The pontificate of Gregory the Great, which lasted thirteen
      years, six months, and ten days, is one of the most edifying
      periods of the history of the church. His virtues, and even his
      faults, a singular mixture of simplicity and cunning, of pride
      and humility, of sense and superstition, were happily suited to
      his station and to the temper of the times. In his rival, the
      patriarch of Constantinople, he condemned the anti-Christian
      title of universal bishop, which the successor of St. Peter was
      too haughty to concede, and too feeble to assume; and the
      ecclesiastical jurisdiction of Gregory was confined to the triple
      character of Bishop of Rome, Primate of Italy, and Apostle of the
      West. He frequently ascended the pulpit, and kindled, by his
      rude, though pathetic, eloquence, the congenial passions of his
      audience: the language of the Jewish prophets was interpreted and
      applied; and the minds of a people, depressed by their present
      calamities, were directed to the hopes and fears of the invisible
      world. His precepts and example defined the model of the Roman
      liturgy; 69 the distribution of the parishes, the calendar of the
      festivals, the order of processions, the service of the priests
      and deacons, the variety and change of sacerdotal garments. Till
      the last days of his life, he officiated in the canon of the
      mass, which continued above three hours: the Gregorian chant 70
      has preserved the vocal and instrumental music of the theatre,
      and the rough voices of the Barbarians attempted to imitate the
      melody of the Roman school. 71 Experience had shown him the
      efficacy of these solemn and pompous rites, to soothe the
      distress, to confirm the faith, to mitigate the fierceness, and
      to dispel the dark enthusiasm of the vulgar, and he readily
      forgave their tendency to promote the reign of priesthood and
      superstition. The bishops of Italy and the adjacent islands
      acknowledged the Roman pontiff as their special metropolitan.
      Even the existence, the union, or the translation of episcopal
      seats was decided by his absolute discretion: and his successful
      inroads into the provinces of Greece, of Spain, and of Gaul,
      might countenance the more lofty pretensions of succeeding popes.
      He interposed to prevent the abuses of popular elections; his
      jealous care maintained the purity of faith and discipline; and
      the apostolic shepherd assiduously watched over the faith and
      discipline of the subordinate pastors. Under his reign, the
      Arians of Italy and Spain were reconciled to the Catholic church,
      and the conquest of Britain reflects less glory on the name of
      Caesar, than on that of Gregory the First. Instead of six
      legions, forty monks were embarked for that distant island, and
      the pontiff lamented the austere duties which forbade him to
      partake the perils of their spiritual warfare. In less than two
      years, he could announce to the archbishop of Alexandria, that
      they had baptized the king of Kent with ten thousand of his
      Anglo-Saxons, and that the Roman missionaries, like those of the
      primitive church, were armed only with spiritual and supernatural
      powers. The credulity or the prudence of Gregory was always
      disposed to confirm the truths of religion by the evidence of
      ghosts, miracles, and resurrections; 72 and posterity has paid to
      his memory the same tribute which he freely granted to the virtue
      of his own or the preceding generation. The celestial honors have
      been liberally bestowed by the authority of the popes, but
      Gregory is the last of their own order whom they have presumed to
      inscribe in the calendar of saints.

      eight modes or fifteen chords of the ancient music. He observes
      (p. 332) that the connoisseurs admire the preface and many
      passages of the Gregorian office.]

      Their temporal power insensibly arose from the calamities of the
      times: and the Roman bishops, who have deluged Europe and Asia
      with blood, were compelled to reign as the ministers of charity
      and peace. I. The church of Rome, as it has been formerly
      observed, was endowed with ample possessions in Italy, Sicily,
      and the more distant provinces; and her agents, who were commonly
      sub-deacons, had acquired a civil, and even criminal,
      jurisdiction over their tenants and husbandmen. The successor of
      St. Peter administered his patrimony with the temper of a
      vigilant and moderate landlord; 73 and the epistles of Gregory
      are filled with salutary instructions to abstain from doubtful or
      vexatious lawsuits; to preserve the integrity of weights and
      measures; to grant every reasonable delay; and to reduce the
      capitation of the slaves of the glebe, who purchased the right of
      marriage by the payment of an arbitrary fine. 74 The rent or the
      produce of these estates was transported to the mouth of the
      Tyber, at the risk and expense of the pope: in the use of wealth
      he acted like a faithful steward of the church and the poor, and
      liberally applied to their wants the inexhaustible resources of
      abstinence and order. The voluminous account of his receipts and
      disbursements was kept above three hundred years in the Lateran,
      as the model of Christian economy. On the four great festivals,
      he divided their quarterly allowance to the clergy, to his
      domestics, to the monasteries, the churches, the places of
      burial, the almshouses, and the hospitals of Rome, and the rest
      of the diocese. On the first day of every month, he distributed
      to the poor, according to the season, their stated portion of
      corn, wine, cheese, vegetables, oil, fish, fresh provisions,
      clothes, and money; and his treasurers were continually summoned
      to satisfy, in his name, the extraordinary demands of indigence
      and merit. The instant distress of the sick and helpless, of
      strangers and pilgrims, was relieved by the bounty of each day,
      and of every hour; nor would the pontiff indulge himself in a
      frugal repast, till he had sent the dishes from his own table to
      some objects deserving of his compassion. The misery of the times
      had reduced the nobles and matrons of Rome to accept, without a
      blush, the benevolence of the church: three thousand virgins
      received their food and raiment from the hand of their
      benefactor; and many bishops of Italy escaped from the Barbarians
      to the hospitable threshold of the Vatican. Gregory might justly
      be styled the Father of his Country; and such was the extreme
      sensibility of his conscience, that, for the death of a beggar
      who had perished in the streets, he interdicted himself during
      several days from the exercise of sacerdotal functions. II. The
      misfortunes of Rome involved the apostolical pastor in the
      business of peace and war; and it might be doubtful to himself,
      whether piety or ambition prompted him to supply the place of his
      absent sovereign. Gregory awakened the emperor from a long
      slumber; exposed the guilt or incapacity of the exarch and his
      inferior ministers; complained that the veterans were withdrawn
      from Rome for the defence of Spoleto; encouraged the Italians to
      guard their cities and altars; and condescended, in the crisis of
      danger, to name the tribunes, and to direct the operations, of
      the provincial troops. But the martial spirit of the pope was
      checked by the scruples of humanity and religion: the imposition
      of tribute, though it was employed in the Italian war, he freely
      condemned as odious and oppressive; whilst he protected, against
      the Imperial edicts, the pious cowardice of the soldiers who
      deserted a military for a monastic life. If we may credit his own
      declarations, it would have been easy for Gregory to exterminate
      the Lombards by their domestic factions, without leaving a king,
      a duke, or a count, to save that unfortunate nation from the
      vengeance of their foes. As a Christian bishop, he preferred the
      salutary offices of peace; his mediation appeased the tumult of
      arms: but he was too conscious of the arts of the Greeks, and the
      passions of the Lombards, to engage his sacred promise for the
      observance of the truce. Disappointed in the hope of a general
      and lasting treaty, he presumed to save his country without the
      consent of the emperor or the exarch. The sword of the enemy was
      suspended over Rome; it was averted by the mild eloquence and
      seasonable gifts of the pontiff, who commanded the respect of
      heretics and Barbarians. The merits of Gregory were treated by
      the Byzantine court with reproach and insult; but in the
      attachment of a grateful people, he found the purest reward of a
      citizen, and the best right of a sovereign. 75

      the patrimonies, lest he should betray that they consisted not of

      useful, details; and the humanity of Fleury dwells on the social
      virtues of Gregory.]
