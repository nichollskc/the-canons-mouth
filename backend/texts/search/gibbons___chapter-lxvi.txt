Chapter LXVI: Union Of The Greek And Latin Churches.—Part I.

     Applications Of The Eastern Emperors To The Popes.—Visits To The
     West, Of John The First, Manuel, And John The Second,
     Palæologus.—Union Of The Greek And Latin Churches, Promoted By The
     Council Of Basil, And Concluded At Ferrara And Florence.—State Of
     Literature At Constantinople.—Its Revival In Italy By The Greek
     Fugitives.—Curiosity And Emulation Of The Latins.

      In the four last centuries of the Greek emperors, their friendly
      or hostile aspect towards the pope and the Latins may be observed
      as the thermometer of their prosperity or distress; as the scale
      of the rise and fall of the Barbarian dynasties. When the Turks
      of the house of Seljuk pervaded Asia, and threatened
      Constantinople, we have seen, at the council of Placentia, the
      suppliant ambassadors of Alexius imploring the protection of the
      common father of the Christians. No sooner had the arms of the
      French pilgrims removed the sultan from Nice to Iconium, than the
      Greek princes resumed, or avowed, their genuine hatred and
      contempt for the schismatics of the West, which precipitated the
      first downfall of their empire. The date of the Mogul invasion is
      marked in the soft and charitable language of John Vataces. After
      the recovery of Constantinople, the throne of the first
      Palæologus was encompassed by foreign and domestic enemies; as
      long as the sword of Charles was suspended over his head, he
      basely courted the favor of the Roman pontiff; and sacrificed to
      the present danger his faith, his virtue, and the affection of
      his subjects. On the decease of Michael, the prince and people
      asserted the independence of their church, and the purity of
      their creed: the elder Andronicus neither feared nor loved the
      Latins; in his last distress, pride was the safeguard of
      superstition; nor could he decently retract in his age the firm
      and orthodox declarations of his youth. His grandson, the younger
      Andronicus, was less a slave in his temper and situation; and the
      conquest of Bithynia by the Turks admonished him to seek a
      temporal and spiritual alliance with the Western princes. After a
      separation and silence of fifty years, a secret agent, the monk
      Barlaam, was despatched to Pope Benedict the Twelfth; and his
      artful instructions appear to have been drawn by the master-hand
      of the great domestic. 1 “Most holy father,” was he commissioned
      to say, “the emperor is not less desirous than yourself of a
      union between the two churches: but in this delicate transaction,
      he is obliged to respect his own dignity and the prejudices of
      his subjects. The ways of union are twofold; force and
      persuasion. Of force, the inefficacy has been already tried;
      since the Latins have subdued the empire, without subduing the
      minds, of the Greeks. The method of persuasion, though slow, is
      sure and permanent. A deputation of thirty or forty of our
      doctors would probably agree with those of the Vatican, in the
      love of truth and the unity of belief; but on their return, what
      would be the use, the recompense, of such an agreement? the scorn
      of their brethren, and the reproaches of a blind and obstinate
      nation. Yet that nation is accustomed to reverence the general
      councils, which have fixed the articles of our faith; and if they
      reprobate the decrees of Lyons, it is because the Eastern
      churches were neither heard nor represented in that arbitrary
      meeting. For this salutary end, it will be expedient, and even
      necessary, that a well-chosen legate should be sent into Greece,
      to convene the patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch,
      and Jerusalem; and, with their aid, to prepare a free and
      universal synod. But at this moment,” continued the subtle agent,
      “the empire is assaulted and endangered by the Turks, who have
      occupied four of the greatest cities of Anatolia. The Christian
      inhabitants have expressed a wish of returning to their
      allegiance and religion; but the forces and revenues of the
      emperor are insufficient for their deliverance: and the Roman
      legate must be accompanied, or preceded, by an army of Franks, to
      expel the infidels, and open a way to the holy sepulchre.” If the
      suspicious Latins should require some pledge, some previous
      effect of the sincerity of the Greeks, the answers of Barlaam
      were perspicuous and rational. “_1._ A general synod can alone
      consummate the union of the churches; nor can such a synod be
      held till the three Oriental patriarchs, and a great number of
      bishops, are enfranchised from the Mahometan yoke. _2._ The
      Greeks are alienated by a long series of oppression and injury:
      they must be reconciled by some act of brotherly love, some
      effectual succor, which may fortify the authority and arguments
      of the emperor, and the friends of the union. _3._ If some
      difference of faith or ceremonies should be found incurable, the
      Greeks, however, are the disciples of Christ; and the Turks are
      the common enemies of the Christian name. The Armenians,
      Cyprians, and Rhodians, are equally attacked; and it will become
      the piety of the French princes to draw their swords in the
      general defence of religion. _4._ Should the subjects of
      Andronicus be treated as the worst of schismatics, of heretics,
      of pagans, a judicious policy may yet instruct the powers of the
      West to embrace a useful ally, to uphold a sinking empire, to
      guard the confines of Europe; and rather to join the Greeks
      against the Turks, than to expect the union of the Turkish arms
      with the troops and treasures of captive Greece.” The reasons,
      the offers, and the demands, of Andronicus were eluded with cold
      and stately indifference. The kings of France and Naples declined
      the dangers and glory of a crusade; the pope refused to call a
      new synod to determine old articles of faith; and his regard for
      the obsolete claims of the Latin emperor and clergy engaged him
      to use an offensive superscription,—“To the _moderator_ 2 of the
      Greeks, and the persons who style themselves the patriarchs of
      the Eastern churches.” For such an embassy, a time and character
      less propitious could not easily have been found. Benedict the
      Twelfth 3 was a dull peasant, perplexed with scruples, and
      immersed in sloth and wine: his pride might enrich with a third
      crown the papal tiara, but he was alike unfit for the regal and
      the pastoral office.

      Bibamus papaliter.]

      After the decease of Andronicus, while the Greeks were distracted
      by intestine war, they could not presume to agitate a general
      union of the Christians. But as soon as Cantacuzene had subdued
      and pardoned his enemies, he was anxious to justify, or at least
      to extenuate, the introduction of the Turks into Europe, and the
      nuptials of his daughter with a Mussulman prince. Two officers of
      state, with a Latin interpreter, were sent in his name to the
      Roman court, which was transplanted to Avignon, on the banks of
      the Rhône, during a period of seventy years: they represented the
      hard necessity which had urged him to embrace the alliance of the
      miscreants, and pronounced by his command the specious and
      edifying sounds of union and crusade. Pope Clement the Sixth, 4
      the successor of Benedict, received them with hospitality and
      honor, acknowledged the innocence of their sovereign, excused his
      distress, applauded his magnanimity, and displayed a clear
      knowledge of the state and revolutions of the Greek empire, which
      he had imbibed from the honest accounts of a Savoyard lady, an
      attendant of the empress Anne. 5 If Clement was ill endowed with
      the virtues of a priest, he possessed, however, the spirit and
      magnificence of a prince, whose liberal hand distributed
      benefices and kingdoms with equal facility. Under his reign
      Avignon was the seat of pomp and pleasure: in his youth he had
      surpassed the licentiousness of a baron; and the palace, nay, the
      bed-chamber of the pope, was adorned, or polluted, by the visits
      of his female favorites. The wars of France and England were
      adverse to the holy enterprise; but his vanity was amused by the
      splendid idea; and the Greek ambassadors returned with two Latin
      bishops, the ministers of the pontiff. On their arrival at
      Constantinople, the emperor and the nuncios admired each other’s
      piety and eloquence; and their frequent conferences were filled
      with mutual praises and promises, by which both parties were
      amused, and neither could be deceived. “I am delighted,” said the
      devout Cantacuzene, “with the project of our holy war, which must
      redound to my personal glory, as well as to the public benefit of
      Christendom. My dominions will give a free passage to the armies
      of France: my troops, my galleys, my treasures, shall be
      consecrated to the common cause; and happy would be my fate,
      could I deserve and obtain the crown of martyrdom. Words are
      insufficient to express the ardor with which I sigh for the
      reunion of the scattered members of Christ. If my death could
      avail, I would gladly present my sword and my neck: if the
      spiritual phnix could arise from my ashes, I would erect the
      pile, and kindle the flame with my own hands.” Yet the Greek
      emperor presumed to observe, that the articles of faith which
      divided the two churches had been introduced by the pride and
      precipitation of the Latins: he disclaimed the servile and
      arbitrary steps of the first Palæologus; and firmly declared,
      that he would never submit his conscience unless to the decrees
      of a free and universal synod. “The situation of the times,”
      continued he, “will not allow the pope and myself to meet either
      at Rome or Constantinople; but some maritime city may be chosen
      on the verge of the two empires, to unite the bishops, and to
      instruct the faithful, of the East and West.” The nuncios seemed
      content with the proposition; and Cantacuzene affects to deplore
      the failure of his hopes, which were soon overthrown by the death
      of Clement, and the different temper of his successor. His own
      life was prolonged, but it was prolonged in a cloister; and,
      except by his prayers, the humble monk was incapable of directing
      the counsels of his pupil or the state. 6

      6 (return) [ See this whole negotiation in Cantacuzene, (l. iv.
      c. 9,) who, amidst the praises and virtues which he bestows on
      himself, reveals the uneasiness of a guilty conscience.]

      Yet of all the Byzantine princes, that pupil, John Palæologus,
      was the best disposed to embrace, to believe, and to obey, the
      shepherd of the West. His mother, Anne of Savoy, was baptized in
      the bosom of the Latin church: her marriage with Andronicus
      imposed a change of name, of apparel, and of worship, but her
      heart was still faithful to her country and religion: she had
      formed the infancy of her son, and she governed the emperor,
      after his mind, or at least his stature, was enlarged to the size
      of man. In the first year of his deliverance and restoration, the
      Turks were still masters of the Hellespont; the son of
      Cantacuzene was in arms at Adrianople; and Palæologus could
      depend neither on himself nor on his people. By his mother’s
      advice, and in the hope of foreign aid, he abjured the rights
      both of the church and state; and the act of slavery, 7
      subscribed in purple ink, and sealed with the _golden_ bull, was
      privately intrusted to an Italian agent. The first article of the
      treaty is an oath of fidelity and obedience to Innocent the Sixth
      and his successors, the supreme pontiffs of the Roman and
      Catholic church. The emperor promises to entertain with due
      reverence their legates and nuncios; to assign a palace for their
      residence, and a temple for their worship; and to deliver his
      second son Manuel as the hostage of his faith. For these
      condescensions he requires a prompt succor of fifteen galleys,
      with five hundred men at arms, and a thousand archers, to serve
      against his Christian and Mussulman enemies. Palæologus engages
      to impose on his clergy and people the same spiritual yoke; but
      as the resistance of the Greeks might be justly foreseen, he
      adopts the two effectual methods of corruption and education. The
      legate was empowered to distribute the vacant benefices among the
      ecclesiastics who should subscribe the creed of the Vatican:
      three schools were instituted to instruct the youth of
      Constantinople in the language and doctrine of the Latins; and
      the name of Andronicus, the heir of the empire, was enrolled as
      the first student. Should he fail in the measures of persuasion
      or force, Palæologus declares himself unworthy to reign;
      transferred to the pope all regal and paternal authority; and
      invests Innocent with full power to regulate the family, the
      government, and the marriage, of his son and successor. But this
      treaty was neither executed nor published: the Roman galleys were
      as vain and imaginary as the submission of the Greeks; and it was
      only by the secrecy that their sovereign escaped the dishonor of
      this fruitless humiliation.

      7 (return) [ See this ignominious treaty in Fleury, (Hist.
      Ecclés. p. 151—154,) from Raynaldus, who drew it from the Vatican
      archives. It was not worth the trouble of a pious forgery.]

      The tempest of the Turkish arms soon burst on his head; and after
      the loss of Adrianople and Romania, he was enclosed in his
      capital, the vassal of the haughty Amurath, with the miserable
      hope of being the last devoured by the savage. In this abject
      state, Palæologus embraced the resolution of embarking for
      Venice, and casting himself at the feet of the pope: he was the
      first of the Byzantine princes who had ever visited the unknown
      regions of the West, yet in them alone he could seek consolation
      or relief; and with less violation of his dignity he might appear
      in the sacred college than at the Ottoman _Porte_. After a long
      absence, the Roman pontiffs were returning from Avignon to the
      banks of the Tyber: Urban the Fifth, 8 of a mild and virtuous
      character, encouraged or allowed the pilgrimage of the Greek
      prince; and, within the same year, enjoyed the glory of receiving
      in the Vatican the two Imperial shadows who represented the
      majesty of Constantine and Charlemagne. In this suppliant visit,
      the emperor of Constantinople, whose vanity was lost in his
      distress, gave more than could be expected of empty sounds and
      formal submissions. A previous trial was imposed; and, in the
      presence of four cardinals, he acknowledged, as a true Catholic,
      the supremacy of the pope, and the double procession of the Holy
      Ghost. After this purification, he was introduced to a public
      audience in the church of St. Peter: Urban, in the midst of the
      cardinals, was seated on his throne; the Greek monarch, after
      three genuflections, devoutly kissed the feet, the hands, and at
      length the mouth, of the holy father, who celebrated high mass in
      his presence, allowed him to lead the bridle of his mule, and
      treated him with a sumptuous banquet in the Vatican. The
      entertainment of Palæologus was friendly and honorable; yet some
      difference was observed between the emperors of the East and
      West; 9 nor could the former be entitled to the rare privilege of
      chanting the gospel in the rank of a deacon. 10 In favor of his
      proselyte, Urban strove to rekindle the zeal of the French king
      and the other powers of the West; but he found them cold in the
      general cause, and active only in their domestic quarrels. The
      last hope of the emperor was in an English mercenary, John
      Hawkwood, 11 or Acuto, who, with a band of adventurers, the white
      brotherhood, had ravaged Italy from the Alps to Calabria; sold
      his services to the hostile states; and incurred a just
      excommunication by shooting his arrows against the papal
      residence. A special license was granted to negotiate with the
      outlaw, but the forces, or the spirit, of Hawkwood, were unequal
      to the enterprise: and it was for the advantage, perhaps, of
      Palæologus to be disappointed of succor, that must have been
      costly, that could not be effectual, and which might have been
      dangerous. 12 The disconsolate Greek 13 prepared for his return,
      but even his return was impeded by a most ignominious obstacle.
      On his arrival at Venice, he had borrowed large sums at
      exorbitant usury; but his coffers were empty, his creditors were
      impatient, and his person was detained as the best security for
      the payment. His eldest son, Andronicus, the regent of
      Constantinople, was repeatedly urged to exhaust every resource;
      and even by stripping the churches, to extricate his father from
      captivity and disgrace. But the unnatural youth was insensible of
      the disgrace, and secretly pleased with the captivity of the
      emperor: the state was poor, the clergy were obstinate; nor could
      some religious scruple be wanting to excuse the guilt of his
      indifference and delay. Such undutiful neglect was severely
      reproved by the piety of his brother Manuel, who instantly sold
      or mortgaged all that he possessed, embarked for Venice, relieved
      his father, and pledged his own freedom to be responsible for the
      debt. On his return to Constantinople, the parent and king
      distinguished his two sons with suitable rewards; but the faith
      and manners of the slothful Palæologus had not been improved by
      his Roman pilgrimage; and his apostasy or conversion, devoid of
      any spiritual or temporal effects, was speedily forgotten by the
      Greeks and Latins. 14

      generously thinks that the merits of Charles IV. might have
      entitled him, though not on the proper day, (A.D. 1368, November
      1,) to the whole privilege. He seems to affix a just value on the

      name of our adventurous countryman, (Thomas Walsingham, Hist.
      Anglican. inter Scriptores Camdeni, p. 184.) After two-and-twenty
      victories, and one defeat, he died, in 1394, general of the
      Florentines, and was buried with such honors as the republic has
      not paid to Dante or Petrarch, (Muratori, Annali d’Italia, tom.

      is rather true than civil. “Ci mancava ancor questo, che dopo
      essere calpestrata l’Italia da tanti masnadieri Tedeschi ed
      Ungheri, venissero fin dall’ Inghliterra nuovi _cani_ a finire di
      divorarla.”]

      bene consolatus et contentus, (Vit. Urban V. p. 623.)]

      14 (return) [ His return in 1370, and the coronation of Manuel,
      Sept. 25, 1373, (Ducange, Fam. Byzant. p. 241,) leaves some
      intermediate æra for the conspiracy and punishment of
      Andronicus.]

      Thirty years after the return of Palæologus, his son and
      successor, Manuel, from a similar motive, but on a larger scale,
      again visited the countries of the West. In a preceding chapter I
      have related his treaty with Bajazet, the violation of that
      treaty, the siege or blockade of Constantinople, and the French
      succor under the command of the gallant Boucicault. 15 By his
      ambassadors, Manuel had solicited the Latin powers; but it was
      thought that the presence of a distressed monarch would draw
      tears and supplies from the hardest Barbarians; 16 and the
      marshal who advised the journey prepared the reception of the
      Byzantine prince. The land was occupied by the Turks; but the
      navigation of Venice was safe and open: Italy received him as the
      first, or, at least, as the second, of the Christian princes;
      Manuel was pitied as the champion and confessor of the faith; and
      the dignity of his behavior prevented that pity from sinking into
      contempt. From Venice he proceeded to Padua and Pavia; and even
      the duke of Milan, a secret ally of Bajazet, gave him safe and
      honorable conduct to the verge of his dominions. 17 On the
      confines of France 18 the royal officers undertook the care of
      his person, journey, and expenses; and two thousand of the
      richest citizens, in arms and on horseback, came forth to meet
      him as far as Charenton, in the neighborhood of the capital. At
      the gates of Paris, he was saluted by the chancellor and the
      parliament; and Charles the Sixth, attended by his princes and
      nobles, welcomed his brother with a cordial embrace. The
      successor of Constantine was clothed in a robe of white silk, and
      mounted on a milk-white steed, a circumstance, in the French
      ceremonial, of singular importance: the white color is considered
      as the symbol of sovereignty; and, in a late visit, the German
      emperor, after a haughty demand and a peevish refusal, had been
      reduced to content himself with a black courser. Manuel was
      lodged in the Louvre; a succession of feasts and balls, the
      pleasures of the banquet and the chase, were ingeniously varied
      by the politeness of the French, to display their magnificence,
      and amuse his grief: he was indulged in the liberty of his
      chapel; and the doctors of the Sorbonne were astonished, and
      possibly scandalized, by the language, the rites, and the
      vestments, of his Greek clergy. But the slightest glance on the
      state of the kingdom must teach him to despair of any effectual
      assistance. The unfortunate Charles, though he enjoyed some lucid
      intervals, continually relapsed into furious or stupid insanity:
      the reins of government were alternately seized by his brother
      and uncle, the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy, whose factious
      competition prepared the miseries of civil war. The former was a
      gay youth, dissolved in luxury and love: the latter was the
      father of John count of Nevers, who had so lately been ransomed
      from Turkish captivity; and, if the fearless son was ardent to
      revenge his defeat, the more prudent Burgundy was content with
      the cost and peril of the first experiment. When Manuel had
      satiated the curiosity, and perhaps fatigued the patience, of the
      French, he resolved on a visit to the adjacent island. In his
      progress from Dover, he was entertained at Canterbury with due
      reverence by the prior and monks of St. Austin; and, on
      Blackheath, King Henry the Fourth, with the English court,
      saluted the Greek hero, (I copy our old historian,) who, during
      many days, was lodged and treated in London as emperor of the
      East. 19 But the state of England was still more adverse to the
      design of the holy war. In the same year, the hereditary
      sovereign had been deposed and murdered: the reigning prince was
      a successful usurper, whose ambition was punished by jealousy and
      remorse: nor could Henry of Lancaster withdraw his person or
      forces from the defence of a throne incessantly shaken by
      conspiracy and rebellion. He pitied, he praised, he feasted, the
      emperor of Constantinople; but if the English monarch assumed the
      cross, it was only to appease his people, and perhaps his
      conscience, by the merit or semblance of his pious intention. 20
      Satisfied, however, with gifts and honors, Manuel returned to
      Paris; and, after a residence of two years in the West, shaped
      his course through Germany and Italy, embarked at Venice, and
      patiently expected, in the Morea, the moment of his ruin or
      deliverance. Yet he had escaped the ignominious necessity of
      offering his religion to public or private sale. The Latin church
      was distracted by the great schism; the kings, the nations, the
      universities, of Europe were divided in their obedience between
      the popes of Rome and Avignon; and the emperor, anxious to
      conciliate the friendship of both parties, abstained from any
      correspondence with the indigent and unpopular rivals. His
      journey coincided with the year of the jubilee; but he passed
      through Italy without desiring, or deserving, the plenary
      indulgence which abolished the guilt or penance of the sins of
      the faithful. The Roman pope was offended by this neglect;
      accused him of irreverence to an image of Christ; and exhorted
      the princes of Italy to reject and abandon the obstinate
      schismatic. 21

      Chapter LXVI: Union Of The Greek And Latin Churches.—Part II.

      During the period of the crusades, the Greeks beheld with
      astonishment and terror the perpetual stream of emigration that
      flowed, and continued to flow, from the unknown climates of their
      West. The visits of their last emperors removed the veil of
      separation, and they disclosed to their eyes the powerful nations
      of Europe, whom they no longer presumed to brand with the name of
      Barbarians. The observations of Manuel, and his more inquisitive
      followers, have been preserved by a Byzantine historian of the
      times: 22 his scattered ideas I shall collect and abridge; and it
      may be amusing enough, perhaps instructive, to contemplate the
      rude pictures of Germany, France, and England, whose ancient and
      modern state are so familiar to _our_ minds. I. Germany (says the
      Greek Chalcondyles) is of ample latitude from Vienna to the
      ocean; and it stretches (a strange geography) from Prague in
      Bohemia to the River Tartessus, and the Pyrenæan Mountains. 23
      The soil, except in figs and olives, is sufficiently fruitful;
      the air is salubrious; the bodies of the natives are robust and
      healthy; and these cold regions are seldom visited with the
      calamities of pestilence, or earthquakes. After the Scythians or
      Tartars, the Germans are the most numerous of nations: they are
      brave and patient; and were they united under a single head,
      their force would be irresistible. By the gift of the pope, they
      have acquired the privilege of choosing the Roman emperor; 24 nor
      is any people more devoutly attached to the faith and obedience
      of the Latin patriarch. The greatest part of the country is
      divided among the princes and prelates; but Strasburg, Cologne,
      Hamburgh, and more than two hundred free cities, are governed by
      sage and equal laws, according to the will, and for the
      advantage, of the whole community. The use of duels, or single
      combats on foot, prevails among them in peace and war: their
      industry excels in all the mechanic arts; and the Germans may
      boast of the invention of gunpowder and cannon, which is now
      diffused over the greatest part of the world. II. The kingdom of
      France is spread above fifteen or twenty days’ journey from
      Germany to Spain, and from the Alps to the British Ocean;
      containing many flourishing cities, and among these Paris, the
      seat of the king, which surpasses the rest in riches and luxury.
      Many princes and lords alternately wait in his palace, and
      acknowledge him as their sovereign: the most powerful are the
      dukes of Bretagne and Burgundy; of whom the latter possesses the
      wealthy province of Flanders, whose harbors are frequented by the
      ships and merchants of our own, and the more remote, seas. The
      French are an ancient and opulent people; and their language and
      manners, though somewhat different, are not dissimilar from those
      of the Italians. Vain of the Imperial dignity of Charlemagne, of
      their victories over the Saracens, and of the exploits of their
      heroes, Oliver and Rowland, 25 they esteem themselves the first
      of the western nations; but this foolish arrogance has been
      recently humbled by the unfortunate events of their wars against
      the English, the inhabitants of the British island. III. Britain,
      in the ocean, and opposite to the shores of Flanders, may be
      considered either as one, or as three islands; but the whole is
      united by a common interest, by the same manners, and by a
      similar government. The measure of its circumference is five
      thousand stadia: the land is overspread with towns and villages:
      though destitute of wine, and not abounding in fruit-trees, it is
      fertile in wheat and barley; in honey and wool; and much cloth is
      manufactured by the inhabitants. In populousness and power, in
      richness and luxury, London, 26 the metropolis of the isle, may
      claim a preeminence over all the cities of the West. It is
      situate on the Thames, a broad and rapid river, which at the
      distance of thirty miles falls into the Gallic Sea; and the daily
      flow and ebb of the tide affords a safe entrance and departure to
      the vessels of commerce. The king is head of a powerful and
      turbulent aristocracy: his principal vassals hold their estates
      by a free and unalterable tenure; and the laws define the limits
      of his authority and their obedience. The kingdom has been often
      afflicted by foreign conquest and domestic sedition: but the
      natives are bold and hardy, renowned in arms and victorious in
      war. The form of their shields or targets is derived from the
      Italians, that of their swords from the Greeks; the use of the
      long bow is the peculiar and decisive advantage of the English.
      Their language bears no affinity to the idioms of the Continent:
      in the habits of domestic life, they are not easily distinguished
      from their neighbors of France: but the most singular
      circumstance of their manners is their disregard of conjugal
      honor and of female chastity. In their mutual visits, as the
      first act of hospitality, the guest is welcomed in the embraces
      of their wives and daughters: among friends they are lent and
      borrowed without shame; nor are the islanders offended at this
      strange commerce, and its inevitable consequences. 27 Informed as
      we are of the customs of Old England and assured of the virtue of
      our mothers, we may smile at the credulity, or resent the
      injustice, of the Greek, who must have confounded a modest salute
      28 with a criminal embrace. But his credulity and injustice may
      teach an important lesson; to distrust the accounts of foreign
      and remote nations, and to suspend our belief of every tale that
      deviates from the laws of nature and the character of man. 29

      22 (return) [ The Greek and Turkish history of Laonicus

      contemporaries of the same name contributed to the revival of the

      have studied the manners of that gentle and amorous people.]

      After his return, and the victory of Timour, Manuel reigned many
      years in prosperity and peace. As long as the sons of Bajazet
      solicited his friendship and spared his dominions, he was
      satisfied with the national religion; and his leisure was
      employed in composing twenty theological dialogues for its
      defence. The appearance of the Byzantine ambassadors at the
      council of Constance, 30 announces the restoration of the Turkish
      power, as well as of the Latin church: the conquest of the
      sultans, Mahomet and Amurath, reconciled the emperor to the
      Vatican; and the siege of Constantinople almost tempted him to
      acquiesce in the double procession of the Holy Ghost. When Martin
      the Fifth ascended without a rival the chair of St. Peter, a
      friendly intercourse of letters and embassies was revived between
      the East and West. Ambition on one side, and distress on the
      other, dictated the same decent language of charity and peace:
      the artful Greek expressed a desire of marrying his six sons to
      Italian princesses; and the Roman, not less artful, despatched
      the daughter of the marquis of Montferrat, with a company of
      noble virgins, to soften, by their charms, the obstinacy of the
      schismatics. Yet under this mask of zeal, a discerning eye will
      perceive that all was hollow and insincere in the court and
      church of Constantinople. According to the vicissitudes of danger
      and repose, the emperor advanced or retreated; alternately
      instructed and disavowed his ministers; and escaped from the
      importunate pressure by urging the duty of inquiry, the
      obligation of collecting the sense of his patriarchs and bishops,
      and the impossibility of convening them at a time when the
      Turkish arms were at the gates of his capital. From a review of
      the public transactions it will appear that the Greeks insisted
      on three successive measures, a succor, a council, and a final
      reunion, while the Latins eluded the second, and only promised
      the first, as a consequential and voluntary reward of the third.
      But we have an opportunity of unfolding the most secret
      intentions of Manuel, as he explained them in a private
      conversation without artifice or disguise. In his declining age,
      the emperor had associated John Palæologus, the second of the
      name, and the eldest of his sons, on whom he devolved the
      greatest part of the authority and weight of government. One day,
      in the presence only of the historian Phranza, 31 his favorite
      chamberlain, he opened to his colleague and successor the true
      principle of his negotiations with the pope. 32 “Our last
      resource,” said Manuel, against the Turks, “is their fear of our
      union with the Latins, of the warlike nations of the West, who
      may arm for our relief and for their destruction. As often as you
      are threatened by the miscreants, present this danger before
      their eyes. Propose a council; consult on the means; but ever
      delay and avoid the convocation of an assembly, which cannot tend
      either to our spiritual or temporal emolument. The Latins are
      proud; the Greeks are obstinate; neither party will recede or
      retract; and the attempt of a perfect union will confirm the
      schism, alienate the churches, and leave us, without hope or
      defence, at the mercy of the Barbarians.” Impatient of this
      salutary lesson, the royal youth arose from his seat, and
      departed in silence; and the wise monarch (continued Phranza)
      casting his eyes on me, thus resumed his discourse: “My son deems
      himself a great and heroic prince; but, alas! our miserable age
      does not afford scope for heroism or greatness. His daring spirit
      might have suited the happier times of our ancestors; but the
      present state requires not an emperor, but a cautious steward of
      the last relics of our fortunes. Well do I remember the lofty
      expectations which he built on our alliance with Mustapha; and
      much do I fear, that this rash courage will urge the ruin of our
      house, and that even religion may precipitate our downfall.” Yet
      the experience and authority of Manuel preserved the peace, and
      eluded the council; till, in the seventy-eighth year of his age,
      and in the habit of a monk, he terminated his career, dividing
      his precious movables among his children and the poor, his
      physicians and his favorite servants. Of his six sons, 33
      Andronicus the Second was invested with the principality of
      Thessalonica, and died of a leprosy soon after the sale of that
      city to the Venetians and its final conquest by the Turks. Some
      fortunate incidents had restored Peloponnesus, or the Morea, to
      the empire; and in his more prosperous days, Manuel had fortified
      the narrow isthmus of six miles 34 with a stone wall and one
      hundred and fifty-three towers. The wall was overthrown by the
      first blast of the Ottomans; the fertile peninsula might have
      been sufficient for the four younger brothers, Theodore and
      Constantine, Demetrius and Thomas; but they wasted in domestic
      contests the remains of their strength; and the least successful
      of the rivals were reduced to a life of dependence in the
      Byzantine palace.

      to his successor: Imprimis vero hunc Phranzen tibi commendo, qui

      than that of 660 French _toises_, which is assigned by D’Anville,
      as still in use in Turkey. Five miles are commonly reckoned for
      the breadth of the isthmus. See the Travels of Spon, Wheeler and
      Chandler.]

      The eldest of the sons of Manuel, John Palæologus the Second, was
      acknowledged, after his father’s death, as the sole emperor of
      the Greeks. He immediately proceeded to repudiate his wife, and
      to contract a new marriage with the princess of Trebizond: beauty
      was in his eyes the first qualification of an empress; and the
      clergy had yielded to his firm assurance, that unless he might be
      indulged in a divorce, he would retire to a cloister, and leave
      the throne to his brother Constantine. The first, and in truth
      the only, victory of Palæologus, was over a Jew, 35 whom, after a
      long and learned dispute, he converted to the Christian faith;
      and this momentous conquest is carefully recorded in the history
      of the times. But he soon resumed the design of uniting the East
      and West; and, regardless of his father’s advice, listened, as it
      should seem with sincerity, to the proposal of meeting the pope
      in a general council beyond the Adriatic. This dangerous project
      was encouraged by Martin the Fifth, and coldly entertained by his
      successor Eugenius, till, after a tedious negotiation, the
      emperor received a summons from the Latin assembly of a new
      character, the independent prelates of Basil, who styled
      themselves the representatives and judges of the Catholic church.

      35 (return) [ The first objection of the Jews is on the death of
      Christ: if it were voluntary, Christ was a suicide; which the
      emperor parries with a mystery. They then dispute on the
      conception of the Virgin, the sense of the prophecies, &c.,
      (Phranzes, l. ii. c. 12, a whole chapter.)]

      The Roman pontiff had fought and conquered in the cause of
      ecclesiastical freedom; but the victorious clergy were soon
      exposed to the tyranny of their deliverer; and his sacred
      character was invulnerable to those arms which they found so keen
      and effectual against the civil magistrate. Their great charter,
      the right of election, was annihilated by appeals, evaded by
      trusts or commendams, disappointed by reversionary grants, and
      superseded by previous and arbitrary reservations. 36 A public
      auction was instituted in the court of Rome: the cardinals and
      favorites were enriched with the spoils of nations; and every
      country might complain that the most important and valuable
      benefices were accumulated on the heads of aliens and absentees.
      During their residence at Avignon, the ambition of the popes
      subsided in the meaner passions of avarice 37 and luxury: they
      rigorously imposed on the clergy the tributes of first-fruits and
      tenths; but they freely tolerated the impunity of vice, disorder,
      and corruption. These manifold scandals were aggravated by the
      great schism of the West, which continued above fifty years. In
      the furious conflicts of Rome and Avignon, the vices of the
      rivals were mutually exposed; and their precarious situation
      degraded their authority, relaxed their discipline, and
      multiplied their wants and exactions. To heal the wounds, and
      restore the monarchy, of the church, the synods of Pisa and
      Constance 38 were successively convened; but these great
      assemblies, conscious of their strength, resolved to vindicate
      the privileges of the Christian aristocracy. From a personal
      sentence against two pontiffs, whom they rejected, and a third,
      their acknowledged sovereign, whom they deposed, the fathers of
      Constance proceeded to examine the nature and limits of the Roman
      supremacy; nor did they separate till they had established the
      authority, above the pope, of a general council. It was enacted,
      that, for the government and reformation of the church, such
      assemblies should be held at regular intervals; and that each
      synod, before its dissolution, should appoint the time and place
      of the subsequent meeting. By the influence of the court of Rome,
      the next convocation at Sienna was easily eluded; but the bold
      and vigorous proceedings of the council of Basil 39 had almost
      been fatal to the reigning pontiff, Eugenius the Fourth. A just
      suspicion of his design prompted the fathers to hasten the
      promulgation of their first decree, that the representatives of
      the church-militant on earth were invested with a divine and
      spiritual jurisdiction over all Christians, without excepting the
      pope; and that a general council could not be dissolved,
      prorogued, or transferred, unless by their free deliberation and
      consent. On the notice that Eugenius had fulminated a bull for
      that purpose, they ventured to summon, to admonish, to threaten,
      to censure the contumacious successor of St. Peter. After many
      delays, to allow time for repentance, they finally declared,
      that, unless he submitted within the term of sixty days, he was
      suspended from the exercise of all temporal and ecclesiastical
      authority. And to mark their jurisdiction over the prince as well
      as the priest, they assumed the government of Avignon, annulled
      the alienation of the sacred patrimony, and protected Rome from
      the imposition of new taxes. Their boldness was justified, not
      only by the general opinion of the clergy, but by the support and
      power of the first monarchs of Christendom: the emperor Sigismond
      declared himself the servant and protector of the synod; Germany
      and France adhered to their cause; the duke of Milan was the
      enemy of Eugenius; and he was driven from the Vatican by an
      insurrection of the Roman people. Rejected at the same time by
      temporal and spiritual subjects, submission was his only choice:
      by a most humiliating bull, the pope repealed his own acts, and
      ratified those of the council; incorporated his legates and
      cardinals with that venerable body; and _seemed_ to resign
      himself to the decrees of the supreme legislature. Their fame
      pervaded the countries of the East: and it was in their presence
      that Sigismond received the ambassadors of the Turkish sultan, 40
      who laid at his feet twelve large vases, filled with robes of
      silk and pieces of gold. The fathers of Basil aspired to the
      glory of reducing the Greeks, as well as the Bohemians, within
      the pale of the church; and their deputies invited the emperor
      and patriarch of Constantinople to unite with an assembly which
      possessed the confidence of the Western nations. Palæologus was
      not averse to the proposal; and his ambassadors were introduced
      with due honors into the Catholic senate. But the choice of the
      place appeared to be an insuperable obstacle, since he refused to
      pass the Alps, or the sea of Sicily, and positively required that
      the synod should be adjourned to some convenient city in Italy,
      or at least on the Danube. The other articles of this treaty were
      more readily stipulated: it was agreed to defray the travelling
      expenses of the emperor, with a train of seven hundred persons,
      41 to remit an immediate sum of eight thousand ducats 42 for the
      accommodation of the Greek clergy; and in his absence to grant a
      supply of ten thousand ducats, with three hundred archers and
      some galleys, for the protection of Constantinople. The city of
      Avignon advanced the funds for the preliminary expenses; and the
      embarkation was prepared at Marseilles with some difficulty and
      delay.

      more than they could hope or want.]

      In his distress, the friendship of Palæologus was disputed by the
      ecclesiastical powers of the West; but the dexterous activity of
      a monarch prevailed over the slow debates and inflexible temper
      of a republic. The decrees of Basil continually tended to
      circumscribe the despotism of the pope, and to erect a supreme
      and perpetual tribunal in the church. Eugenius was impatient of
      the yoke; and the union of the Greeks might afford a decent
      pretence for translating a rebellious synod from the Rhine to the
      Po. The independence of the fathers was lost if they passed the
      Alps: Savoy or Avignon, to which they acceded with reluctance,
      were described at Constantinople as situate far beyond the
      pillars of Hercules; 43 the emperor and his clergy were
      apprehensive of the dangers of a long navigation; they were
      offended by a haughty declaration, that after suppressing the
      _new_ heresy of the Bohemians, the council would soon eradicate
      the _old_ heresy of the Greeks. 44 On the side of Eugenius, all
      was smooth, and yielding, and respectful; and he invited the
      Byzantine monarch to heal by his presence the schism of the
      Latin, as well as of the Eastern, church. Ferrara, near the coast
      of the Adriatic, was proposed for their amicable interview; and
      with some indulgence of forgery and theft, a surreptitious decree
      was procured, which transferred the synod, with its own consent,
      to that Italian city. Nine galleys were equipped for the service
      at Venice, and in the Isle of Candia; their diligence anticipated
      the slower vessels of Basil: the Roman admiral was commissioned
      to burn, sink, and destroy; 45 and these priestly squadrons might
      have encountered each other in the same seas where Athens and
      Sparta had formerly contended for the preeminence of glory.
      Assaulted by the importunity of the factions, who were ready to
      fight for the possession of his person, Palæologus hesitated
      before he left his palace and country on a perilous experiment.
      His father’s advice still dwelt on his memory; and reason must
      suggest, that since the Latins were divided among themselves,
      they could never unite in a foreign cause. Sigismond dissuaded
      the unreasonable adventure; his advice was impartial, since he
      adhered to the council; and it was enforced by the strange
      belief, that the German Cæsar would nominate a Greek his heir and
      successor in the empire of the West. 46 Even the Turkish sultan
      was a counsellor whom it might be unsafe to trust, but whom it
      was dangerous to offend. Amurath was unskilled in the disputes,
      but he was apprehensive of the union, of the Christians. From his
      own treasures, he offered to relieve the wants of the Byzantine
      court; yet he declared with seeming magnanimity, that
      Constantinople should be secure and inviolate, in the absence of
      her sovereign. 47 The resolution of Palæologus was decided by the
      most splendid gifts and the most specious promises: he wished to
      escape for a while from a scene of danger and distress and after
      dismissing with an ambiguous answer the messengers of the
      council, he declared his intention of embarking in the Roman
      galleys. The age of the patriarch Joseph was more susceptible of
      fear than of hope; he trembled at the perils of the sea, and
      expressed his apprehension, that his feeble voice, with thirty
      perhaps of his orthodox brethren, would be oppressed in a foreign
      land by the power and numbers of a Latin synod. He yielded to the
      royal mandate, to the flattering assurance, that he would be
      heard as the oracle of nations, and to the secret wish of
      learning from his brother of the West, to deliver the church from
      the yoke of kings. 48 The five _cross-bearers_, or dignitaries,
      of St. Sophia, were bound to attend his person; and one of these,
      the great ecclesiarch or preacher, Sylvester Syropulus, 49 has
      composed a free and curious history 50 of the _false_ union. 51
      Of the clergy that reluctantly obeyed the summons of the emperor
      and the patriarch, submission was the first duty, and patience
      the most useful virtue. In a chosen list of twenty bishops, we
      discover the metropolitan titles of Heracleæ and Cyzicus, Nice
      and Nicomedia, Ephesus and Trebizond, and the personal merit of
      Mark and Bessarion who, in the confidence of their learning and
      eloquence, were promoted to the episcopal rank. Some monks and
      philosophers were named to display the science and sanctity of
      the Greek church; and the service of the choir was performed by a
      select band of singers and musicians. The patriarchs of
      Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, appeared by their genuine or
      fictitious deputies; the primate of Russia represented a national
      church, and the Greeks might contend with the Latins in the
      extent of their spiritual empire. The precious vases of St.
      Sophia were exposed to the winds and waves, that the patriarch
      might officiate with becoming splendor: whatever gold the emperor
      could procure, was expended in the massy ornaments of his bed and
      chariot; 52 and while they affected to maintain the prosperity of
      their ancient fortune, they quarrelled for the division of
      fifteen thousand ducats, the first alms of the Roman pontiff.
      After the necessary preparations, John Palæologus, with a
      numerous train, accompanied by his brother Demetrius, and the
      most respectable persons of the church and state, embarked in
      eight vessels with sails and oars which steered through the
      Turkish Straits of Gallipoli to the Archipelago, the Morea, and
      the Adriatic Gulf. 53

      43 (return) [ At the end of the Latin version of Phranzes, we
      read a long Greek epistle or declamation of George of Trebizond,
      who advises the emperor to prefer Eugenius and Italy. He treats
      with contempt the schismatic assembly of Basil, the Barbarians of
      Gaul and Germany, who had conspired to transport the chair of St.
      Peter beyond the Alps; oi aqlioi (says he) se kai thn meta sou

      44 (return) [ Syropulus (p. 26—31) attests his own indignation,

      sooner, he would have returned home,(p. 79.)]

      talent of placing each scene before the reader’s eye.]




      Chapter LXVI: Union Of The Greek And Latin Churches.—Part III.

      After a tedious and troublesome navigation of seventy-seven days,
      this religious squadron cast anchor before Venice; and their
      reception proclaimed the joy and magnificence of that powerful
      republic. In the command of the world, the modest Augustus had
      never claimed such honors from his subjects as were paid to his
      feeble successor by an independent state. Seated on the poop on a
      lofty throne, he received the visit, or, in the Greek style, the
      _adoration_ of the doge and senators. 54 They sailed in the
      Bucentaur, which was accompanied by twelve stately galleys: the
      sea was overspread with innumerable gondolas of pomp and
      pleasure; the air resounded with music and acclamations; the
      mariners, and even the vessels, were dressed in silk and gold;
      and in all the emblems and pageants, the Roman eagles were
      blended with the lions of St. Mark. The triumphal procession,
      ascending the great canal, passed under the bridge of the Rialto;
      and the Eastern strangers gazed with admiration on the palaces,
      the churches, and the populousness of a city, that seems to float
      on the bosom of the waves. 55 They sighed to behold the spoils
      and trophies with which it had been decorated after the sack of
      Constantinople. After a hospitable entertainment of fifteen days,
      Palæologus pursued his journey by land and water from Venice to
      Ferrara; and on this occasion the pride of the Vatican was
      tempered by policy to indulge the ancient dignity of the emperor
      of the East. He made his entry on a _black_ horse; but a
      milk-white steed, whose trappings were embroidered with golden
      eagles, was led before him; and the canopy was borne over his
      head by the princes of Este, the sons or kinsmen of Nicholas,
      marquis of the city, and a sovereign more powerful than himself.
      56 Palæologus did not alight till he reached the bottom of the
      staircase: the pope advanced to the door of the apartment;
      refused his proffered genuflection; and, after a paternal
      embrace, conducted the emperor to a seat on his left hand. Nor
      would the patriarch descend from his galley, till a ceremony
      almost equal, had been stipulated between the bishops of Rome and
      Constantinople. The latter was saluted by his brother with a kiss
      of union and charity; nor would any of the Greek ecclesiastics
      submit to kiss the feet of the Western primate. On the opening of
      the synod, the place of honor in the centre was claimed by the
      temporal and ecclesiastical chiefs; and it was only by alleging
      that his predecessors had not assisted in person at Nice or
      Chalcedon, that Eugenius could evade the ancient precedents of
      Constantine and Marcian. After much debate, it was agreed that
      the right and left sides of the church should be occupied by the
      two nations; that the solitary chair of St. Peter should be
      raised the first of the Latin line; and that the throne of the
      Greek emperor, at the head of his clergy, should be equal and
      opposite to the second place, the vacant seat of the emperor of
      the West. 57

      54 (return) [ At the time of the synod, Phranzes was in
      Peloponnesus: but he received from the despot Demetrius a
      faithful account of the honorable reception of the emperor and
      patriarch both at Venice and Ferrara, (Dux.... sedentem
      Imperatorem _adorat_,) which are more slightly mentioned by the
      Latins, (l. ii. c. 14, 15, 16.)]

      55 (return) [ The astonishment of a Greek prince and a French
      ambassador (Mémoires de Philippe de Comines, l. vii. c. 18,) at
      the sight of Venice, abundantly proves that in the xvth century
      it was the first and most splendid of the Christian cities. For
      the spoils of Constantinople at Venice, see Syropulus, (p. 87.)]

      56 (return) [ Nicholas III. of Este reigned forty-eight years,
      (A.D. 1393—1441,) and was lord of Ferrara, Modena, Reggio, Parma,
      Rovigo, and Commachio. See his Life in Muratori, (Antichità
      Estense, tom. ii. p. 159—201.)]

      57 (return) [ The Latin vulgar was provoked to laughter at the
      strange dresses of the Greeks, and especially the length of their
      garments, their sleeves, and their beards; nor was the emperor
      distinguished, except by the purple color, and his diadem or
      tiara, with a jewel on the top, (Hody de Græcis Illustribus, p.
      31.) Yet another spectator confesses that the Greek fashion was
      piu grave e piu degna than the Italian. (Vespasiano in Vit.
      Eugen. IV. in Muratori, tom. xxv. p. 261.)]

      But as soon as festivity and form had given place to a more
      serious treaty, the Greeks were dissatisfied with their journey,
      with themselves, and with the pope. The artful pencil of his
      emissaries had painted him in a prosperous state; at the head of
      the princes and prelates of Europe, obedient at his voice, to
      believe and to arm. The thin appearance of the universal synod of
      Ferrara betrayed his weakness: and the Latins opened the first
      session with only five archbishops, eighteen bishops, and ten
      abbots, the greatest part of whom were the subjects or countrymen
      of the Italian pontiff. Except the duke of Burgundy, none of the
      potentates of the West condescended to appear in person, or by
      their ambassadors; nor was it possible to suppress the judicial
      acts of Basil against the dignity and person of Eugenius, which
      were finally concluded by a new election. Under these
      circumstances, a truce or delay was asked and granted, till
      Palæologus could expect from the consent of the Latins some
      temporal reward for an unpopular union; and after the first
      session, the public proceedings were adjourned above six months.
      The emperor, with a chosen band of his favorites and
      _Janizaries_, fixed his summer residence at a pleasant, spacious
      monastery, six miles from Ferrara; forgot, in the pleasures of
      the chase, the distress of the church and state; and persisted in
      destroying the game, without listening to the just complaints of
      the marquis or the husbandman. 58 In the mean while, his
      unfortunate Greeks were exposed to all the miseries of exile and
      poverty; for the support of each stranger, a monthly allowance
      was assigned of three or four gold florins; and although the
      entire sum did not amount to seven hundred florins, a long arrear
      was repeatedly incurred by the indigence or policy of the Roman
      court. 59 They sighed for a speedy deliverance, but their escape
      was prevented by a triple chain: a passport from their superiors
      was required at the gates of Ferrara; the government of Venice
      had engaged to arrest and send back the fugitives; and inevitable
      punishment awaited them at Constantinople; excommunication,
      fines, and a sentence, which did not respect the sacerdotal
      dignity, that they should be stripped naked and publicly whipped.
      60 It was only by the alternative of hunger or dispute that the
      Greeks could be persuaded to open the first conference; and they
      yielded with extreme reluctance to attend from Ferrara to
      Florence the rear of a flying synod. This new translation was
      urged by inevitable necessity: the city was visited by the
      plague; the fidelity of the marquis might be suspected; the
      mercenary troops of the duke of Milan were at the gates; and as
      they occupied Romagna, it was not without difficulty and danger
      that the pope, the emperor, and the bishops, explored their way
      through the unfrequented paths of the Apennine. 61

      58 (return) [ For the emperor’s hunting, see Syropulus, (p. 143,
      144, 191.) The pope had sent him eleven miserable hacks; but he
      bought a strong and swift horse that came from Russia. The name
      of _Janizaries_ may surprise; but the name, rather than the
      institution, had passed from the Ottoman, to the Byzantine,
      court, and is often used in the last age of the empire.]

      59 (return) [ The Greeks obtained, with much difficulty, that
      instead of provisions, money should be distributed, four florins
      _per_ month to the persons of honorable rank, and three florins
      to their servants, with an addition of thirty more to the
      emperor, twenty-five to the patriarch, and twenty to the prince,
      or despot, Demetrius. The payment of the first month amounted to
      691 florins, a sum which will not allow us to reckon above 200
      Greeks of every condition. (Syropulus, p. 104, 105.) On the 20th
      October, 1438, there was an arrear of four months; in April,
      1439, of three; and of five and a half in July, at the time of
      the union, (p. 172, 225, 271.)]

      60 (return) [ Syropulus (p. 141, 142, 204, 221) deplores the
      imprisonment of the Greeks, and the tyranny of the emperor and
      patriarch.]

      61 (return) [ The wars of Italy are most clearly represented in
      the xiiith vol. of the Annals of Muratori. The schismatic Greek,
      Syropulus, (p. 145,) appears to have exaggerated the fear and
      disorder of the pope in his retreat from Ferrara to Florence,
      which is proved by the acts to have been somewhat more decent and
      deliberate.]

      Yet all these obstacles were surmounted by time and policy. The
      violence of the fathers of Basil rather promoted than injured the
      cause of Eugenius; the nations of Europe abhorred the schism, and
      disowned the election, of Felix the Fifth, who was successively a
      duke of Savoy, a hermit, and a pope; and the great princes were
      gradually reclaimed by his competitor to a favorable neutrality
      and a firm attachment. The legates, with some respectable
      members, deserted to the Roman army, which insensibly rose in
      numbers and reputation; the council of Basil was reduced to
      thirty-nine bishops, and three hundred of the inferior clergy; 62
      while the Latins of Florence could produce the subscriptions of
      the pope himself, eight cardinals, two patriarchs, eight
      archbishops, fifty two bishops, and forty-five abbots, or chiefs
      of religious orders. After the labor of nine months, and the
      debates of twenty-five sessions, they attained the advantage and
      glory of the reunion of the Greeks. Four principal questions had
      been agitated between the two churches; _1._ The use of
      unleavened bread in the communion of Christ’s body. _2._ The
      nature of purgatory. _3._ The supremacy of the pope. And, _4._
      The single or double procession of the Holy Ghost. The cause of
      either nation was managed by ten theological champions: the
      Latins were supported by the inexhaustible eloquence of Cardinal
      Julian; and Mark of Ephesus and Bessarion of Nice were the bold
      and able leaders of the Greek forces. We may bestow some praise
      on the progress of human reason, by observing that the first of
      these questions was now treated as an immaterial rite, which
      might innocently vary with the fashion of the age and country.
      With regard to the second, both parties were agreed in the belief
      of an intermediate state of purgation for the venial sins of the
      faithful; and whether their souls were purified by elemental fire
      was a doubtful point, which in a few years might be conveniently
      settled on the spot by the disputants. The claims of supremacy
      appeared of a more weighty and substantial kind; yet by the
      Orientals the Roman bishop had ever been respected as the first
      of the five patriarchs; nor did they scruple to admit, that his
      jurisdiction should be exercised agreeably to the holy canons; a
      vague allowance, which might be defined or eluded by occasional
      convenience. The procession of the Holy Ghost from the Father
      alone, or from the Father and the Son, was an article of faith
      which had sunk much deeper into the minds of men; and in the
      sessions of Ferrara and Florence, the Latin addition of
      _filioque_ was subdivided into two questions, whether it were
      legal, and whether it were orthodox. Perhaps it may not be
      necessary to boast on this subject of my own impartial
      indifference; but I must think that the Greeks were strongly
      supported by the prohibition of the council of Chalcedon, against
      adding any article whatsoever to the creed of Nice, or rather of
      Constantinople. 63 In earthly affairs, it is not easy to conceive
      how an assembly equal of legislators can bind their successors
      invested with powers equal to their own. But the dictates of
      inspiration must be true and unchangeable; nor should a private
      bishop, or a provincial synod, have presumed to innovate against
      the judgment of the Catholic church. On the substance of the
      doctrine, the controversy was equal and endless: reason is
      confounded by the procession of a deity: the gospel, which lay on
      the altar, was silent; the various texts of the fathers might be
      corrupted by fraud or entangled by sophistry; and the Greeks were
      ignorant of the characters and writings of the Latin saints. 64
      Of this at least we may be sure, that neither side could be
      convinced by the arguments of their opponents. Prejudice may be
      enlightened by reason, and a superficial glance may be rectified
      by a clear and more perfect view of an object adapted to our
      faculties. But the bishops and monks had been taught from their
      infancy to repeat a form of mysterious words: their national and
      personal honor depended on the repetition of the same sounds; and
      their narrow minds were hardened and inflamed by the acrimony of
      a public dispute.

      the council, nor by _all_ the absent bishops of the West, who,
      expressly or tacitly, might adhere to its decrees.]

      producing an old MS. of the second council of Nice, with
      _filioque_ in the Nicene creed. A palpable forgery! (p. 173.)]

      While they were most in a cloud of dust and darkness, the Pope
      and emperor were desirous of a seeming union, which could alone
      accomplish the purposes of their interview; and the obstinacy of
      public dispute was softened by the arts of private and personal
      negotiation. The patriarch Joseph had sunk under the weight of
      age and infirmities; his dying voice breathed the counsels of
      charity and concord, and his vacant benefice might tempt the
      hopes of the ambitious clergy. The ready and active obedience of
      the archbishops of Russia and Nice, of Isidore and Bessarion, was
      prompted and recompensed by their speedy promotion to the dignity
      of cardinals. Bessarion, in the first debates, had stood forth
      the most strenuous and eloquent champion of the Greek church; and
      if the apostate, the bastard, was reprobated by his country, 65
      he appears in ecclesiastical story a rare example of a patriot
      who was recommended to court favor by loud opposition and
      well-timed compliance. With the aid of his two spiritual
      coadjutors, the emperor applied his arguments to the general
      situation and personal characters of the bishops, and each was
      successively moved by authority and example. Their revenues were
      in the hands of the Turks, their persons in those of the Latins:
      an episcopal treasure, three robes and forty ducats, was soon
      exhausted: 66 the hopes of their return still depended on the
      ships of Venice and the alms of Rome; and such was their
      indigence, that their arrears, the payment of a debt, would be
      accepted as a favor, and might operate as a bribe. 67 The danger
      and relief of Constantinople might excuse some prudent and pious
      dissimulation; and it was insinuated, that the obstinate heretics
      who should resist the consent of the East and West would be
      abandoned in a hostile land to the revenge or justice of the
      Roman pontiff. 68 In the first private assembly of the Greeks,
      the formulary of union was approved by twenty-four, and rejected
      by twelve, members; but the five _cross-bearers_ of St. Sophia,
      who aspired to represent the patriarch, were disqualified by
      ancient discipline; and their right of voting was transferred to
      the obsequious train of monks, grammarians, and profane laymen.
      The will of the monarch produced a false and servile unanimity,
      and no more than two patriots had courage to speak their own
      sentiments and those of their country. Demetrius, the emperor’s
      brother, retired to Venice, that he might not be witness of the
      union; and Mark of Ephesus, mistaking perhaps his pride for his
      conscience, disclaimed all communion with the Latin heretics, and
      avowed himself the champion and confessor of the orthodox creed.
      69 In the treaty between the two nations, several forms of
      consent were proposed, such as might satisfy the Latins, without
      dishonoring the Greeks; and they weighed the scruples of words
      and syllables, till the theological balance trembled with a
      slight preponderance in favor of the Vatican. It was agreed (I
      must entreat the attention of the reader) that the Holy Ghost
      proceeds from the Father _and_ the Son, as from one principle and
      one substance; that he proceeds _by_ the Son, being of the same
      nature and substance, and that he proceeds from the Father _and_
      the Son, by one _spiration_ and production. It is less difficult
      to understand the articles of the preliminary treaty; that the
      pope should defray all the expenses of the Greeks in their return
      home; that he should annually maintain two galleys and three
      hundred soldiers for the defence of Constantinople: that all the
      ships which transported pilgrims to Jerusalem should be obliged
      to touch at that port; that as often as they were required, the
      pope should furnish ten galleys for a year, or twenty for six
      months; and that he should powerfully solicit the princes of
      Europe, if the emperor had occasion for land forces.

      years in his monastery, Bessarion himself had collected forty
      gold florins; but of these, the archbishop had expended
      twenty-eight in his voyage from Peloponnesus, and the remainder
      at Constantinople, (Syropulus, p. 127.)]

      67 (return) [ Syropulus denies that the Greeks received any money
      before they had subscribed the art of union, (p. 283:) yet he
      relates some suspicious circumstances; and their bribery and
      corruption are positively affirmed by the historian Ducas.]

      68 (return) [ The Greeks most piteously express their own fears
      of exile and perpetual slavery, (Syropul. p. 196;) and they were
      strongly moved by the emperor’s threats, (p. 260.)]

      69 (return) [ I had forgot another popular and orthodox
      protester: a favorite bound, who usually lay quiet on the
      foot-cloth of the emperor’s throne but who barked most furiously
      while the act of union was reading without being silenced by the
      soothing or the lashes of the royal attendants, (Syropul. p. 265,
      266.)]

      The same year, and almost the same day, were marked by the
      deposition of Eugenius at Basil; and, at Florence, by his reunion
      of the Greeks and Latins. In the former synod, (which he styled
      indeed an assembly of dæmons,) the pope was branded with the
      guilt of simony, perjury, tyranny, heresy, and schism; 70 and
      declared to be incorrigible in his vices, unworthy of any title,
      and incapable of holding any ecclesiastical office. In the
      latter, he was revered as the true and holy vicar of Christ, who,
      after a separation of six hundred years, had reconciled the
      Catholics of the East and West in one fold, and under one
      shepherd. The act of union was subscribed by the pope, the
      emperor, and the principal members of both churches; even by
      those who, like Syropulus, 71 had been deprived of the right of
      voting. Two copies might have sufficed for the East and West; but
      Eugenius was not satisfied, unless four authentic and similar
      transcripts were signed and attested as the monuments of his
      victory. 72 On a memorable day, the sixth of July, the successors
      of St. Peter and Constantine ascended their thrones the two
      nations assembled in the cathedral of Florence; their
      representatives, Cardinal Julian and Bessarion archbishop of
      Nice, appeared in the pulpit, and, after reading in their
      respective tongues the act of union, they mutually embraced, in
      the name and the presence of their applauding brethren. The pope
      and his ministers then officiated according to the Roman liturgy;
      the creed was chanted with the addition of _filioque_; the
      acquiescence of the Greeks was poorly excused by their ignorance
      of the harmonious, but inarticulate sounds; 73 and the more
      scrupulous Latins refused any public celebration of the Byzantine
      rite. Yet the emperor and his clergy were not totally unmindful
      of national honor. The treaty was ratified by their consent: it
      was tacitly agreed that no innovation should be attempted in
      their creed or ceremonies: they spared, and secretly respected,
      the generous firmness of Mark of Ephesus; and, on the decease of
      the patriarch, they refused to elect his successor, except in the
      cathedral of St. Sophia. In the distribution of public and
      private rewards, the liberal pontiff exceeded their hopes and his
      promises: the Greeks, with less pomp and pride, returned by the
      same road of Ferrara and Venice; and their reception at
      Constantinople was such as will be described in the following
      chapter. 74 The success of the first trial encouraged Eugenius to
      repeat the same edifying scenes; and the deputies of the
      Armenians, the Maronites, the Jacobites of Syria and Egypt, the
      Nestorians and the Æthiopians, were successively introduced, to
      kiss the feet of the Roman pontiff, and to announce the obedience
      and the orthodoxy of the East. These Oriental embassies, unknown
      in the countries which they presumed to represent, 75 diffused
      over the West the fame of Eugenius; and a clamor was artfully
      propagated against the remnant of a schism in Switzerland and
      Savoy, which alone impeded the harmony of the Christian world.
      The vigor of opposition was succeeded by the lassitude of
      despair: the council of Basil was silently dissolved; and Felix,
      renouncing the tiara, again withdrew to the devout or delicious
      hermitage of Ripaille. 76 A general peace was secured by mutual
      acts of oblivion and indemnity: all ideas of reformation
      subsided; the popes continued to exercise and abuse their
      ecclesiastical despotism; nor has Rome been since disturbed by
      the mischiefs of a contested election. 77

      of Baskerville’s edition of his works) has celebrated the place
      and the founder. Æneas Sylvius, and the fathers of Basil, applaud
      the austere life of the ducal hermit; but the French and Italian
      proverbs most unluckily attest the popular opinion of his
      luxury.]

      Patricius, an Italian of the xvth century. They are digested and
      abridged by Dupin, (Bibliothèque Ecclés. tom. xii.,) and the
      continuator of Fleury, (tom. xxii.;) and the respect of the
      Gallican church for the adverse parties confines their members to
      an awkward moderation.]

      The journeys of three emperors were unavailing for their
      temporal, or perhaps their spiritual, salvation; but they were
      productive of a beneficial consequence—the revival of the Greek
      learning in Italy, from whence it was propagated to the last
      nations of the West and North. In their lowest servitude and
      depression, the subjects of the Byzantine throne were still
      possessed of a golden key that could unlock the treasures of
      antiquity; of a musical and prolific language, that gives a soul
      to the objects of sense, and a body to the abstractions of
      philosophy. Since the barriers of the monarchy, and even of the
      capital, had been trampled under foot, the various Barbarians had
      doubtless corrupted the form and substance of the national
      dialect; and ample glossaries have been composed, to interpret a
      multitude of words, of Arabic, Turkish, Sclavonian, Latin, or
      French origin. 78 But a purer idiom was spoken in the court and
      taught in the college; and the flourishing state of the language
      is described, and perhaps embellished, by a learned Italian, 79
      who, by a long residence and noble marriage, 80 was naturalized
      at Constantinople about thirty years before the Turkish conquest.
      “The vulgar speech,” says Philelphus, 81 “has been depraved by
      the people, and infected by the multitude of strangers and
      merchants, who every day flock to the city and mingle with the
      inhabitants. It is from the disciples of such a school that the
      Latin language received the versions of Aristotle and Plato; so
      obscure in sense, and in spirit so poor. But the Greeks who have
      escaped the contagion, are those whom _we_ follow; and they alone
      are worthy of our imitation. In familiar discourse, they still
      speak the tongue of Aristophanes and Euripides, of the historians
      and philosophers of Athens; and the style of their writings is
      still more elaborate and correct. The persons who, by their birth
      and offices, are attached to the Byzantine court, are those who
      maintain, with the least alloy, the ancient standard of elegance
      and purity; and the native graces of language most conspicuously
      shine among the noble matrons, who are excluded from all
      intercourse with foreigners. With foreigners do I say? They live
      retired and sequestered from the eyes of their fellow-citizens.
      Seldom are they seen in the streets; and when they leave their
      houses, it is in the dusk of evening, on visits to the churches
      and their nearest kindred. On these occasions, they are on
      horseback, covered with a veil, and encompassed by their parents,
      their husbands, or their servants.” 82

      Among the Greeks a numerous and opulent clergy was dedicated to
      the service of religion: their monks and bishops have ever been
      distinguished by the gravity and austerity of their manners; nor
      were they diverted, like the Latin priests, by the pursuits and
      pleasures of a secular, and even military, life. After a large
      deduction for the time and talent that were lost in the devotion,
      the laziness, and the discord, of the church and cloister, the
      more inquisitive and ambitious minds would explore the sacred and
      profane erudition of their native language. The ecclesiastics
      presided over the education of youth; the schools of philosophy
      and eloquence were perpetuated till the fall of the empire; and
      it may be affirmed, that more books and more knowledge were
      included within the walls of Constantinople, than could be
      dispersed over the extensive countries of the West. 83 But an
      important distinction has been already noticed: the Greeks were
      stationary or retrograde, while the Latins were advancing with a
      rapid and progressive motion. The nations were excited by the
      spirit of independence and emulation; and even the little world
      of the Italian states contained more people and industry than the
      decreasing circle of the Byzantine empire. In Europe, the lower
      ranks of society were relieved from the yoke of feudal servitude;
      and freedom is the first step to curiosity and knowledge. The
      use, however rude and corrupt, of the Latin tongue had been
      preserved by superstition; the universities, from Bologna to
      Oxford, 84 were peopled with thousands of scholars; and their
      misguided ardor might be directed to more liberal and manly
      studies. In the resurrection of science, Italy was the first that
      cast away her shroud; and the eloquent Petrarch, by his lessons
      and his example, may justly be applauded as the first harbinger
      of day. A purer style of composition, a more generous and
      rational strain of sentiment, flowed from the study and imitation
      of the writers of ancient Rome; and the disciples of Cicero and
      Virgil approached, with reverence and love, the sanctuary of
      their Grecian masters. In the sack of Constantinople, the French,
      and even the Venetians, had despised and destroyed the works of
      Lysippus and Homer: the monuments of art may be annihilated by a
      single blow; but the immortal mind is renewed and multiplied by
      the copies of the pen; and such copies it was the ambition of
      Petrarch and his friends to possess and understand. The arms of
      the Turks undoubtedly pressed the flight of the Muses; yet we may
      tremble at the thought, that Greece might have been overwhelmed,
      with her schools and libraries, before Europe had emerged from
      the deluge of barbarism; that the seeds of science might have

      for their cultivation.

      ten or twelve is prior to the year 1300. They were crowded in
      proportion to their scarcity. Bologna contained 10,000 students,
      chiefly of the civil law. In the year 1357 the number at Oxford
      had decreased from 30,000 to 6000 scholars, (Henry’s History of
      Great Britain, vol. iv. p. 478.) Yet even this decrease is much
      superior to the present list of the members of the university.]




      Chapter LXVI: Union Of The Greek And Latin Churches.—Part IV.

      The most learned Italians of the fifteenth century have confessed
      and applauded the restoration of Greek literature, after a long
      oblivion of many hundred years. 85 Yet in that country, and
      beyond the Alps, some names are quoted; some profound scholars,
      who in the darker ages were honorably distinguished by their
      knowledge of the Greek tongue; and national vanity has been loud
      in the praise of such rare examples of erudition. Without
      scrutinizing the merit of individuals, truth must observe, that
      their science is without a cause, and without an effect; that it
      was easy for them to satisfy themselves and their more ignorant
      contemporaries; and that the idiom, which they had so
      marvellously acquired was transcribed in few manuscripts, and was
      not taught in any university of the West. In a corner of Italy,
      it faintly existed as the popular, or at least as the
      ecclesiastical dialect. 86 The first impression of the Doric and
      Ionic colonies has never been completely erased: the Calabrian
      churches were long attached to the throne of Constantinople: and
      the monks of St. Basil pursued their studies in Mount Athos and
      the schools of the East. Calabria was the native country of
      Barlaam, who has already appeared as a sectary and an ambassador;
      and Barlaam was the first who revived, beyond the Alps, the
      memory, or at least the writings, of Homer. 87 He is described,
      by Petrarch and Boccace, 88 as a man of diminutive stature,
      though truly great in the measure of learning and genius; of a
      piercing discernment, though of a slow and painful elocution. For
      many ages (as they affirm) Greece had not produced his equal in
      the knowledge of history, grammar, and philosophy; and his merit
      was celebrated in the attestations of the princes and doctors of
      Constantinople. One of these attestations is still extant; and
      the emperor Cantacuzene, the protector of his adversaries, is
      forced to allow, that Euclid, Aristotle, and Plato, were familiar
      to that profound and subtle logician. 89 In the court of Avignon,
      he formed an intimate connection with Petrarch, 90 the first of
      the Latin scholars; and the desire of mutual instruction was the
      principle of their literary commerce. The Tuscan applied himself
      with eager curiosity and assiduous diligence to the study of the
      Greek language; and in a laborious struggle with the dryness and
      difficulty of the first rudiments, he began to reach the sense,
      and to feel the spirit, of poets and philosophers, whose minds
      were congenial to his own. But he was soon deprived of the
      society and lessons of this useful assistant: Barlaam
      relinquished his fruitless embassy; and, on his return to Greece,
      he rashly provoked the swarms of fanatic monks, by attempting to
      substitute the light of reason to that of their navel. After a
      separation of three years, the two friends again met in the court
      of Naples: but the generous pupil renounced the fairest occasion
      of improvement; and by his recommendation Barlaam was finally
      settled in a small bishopric of his native Calabria. 91 The
      manifold avocations of Petrarch, love and friendship, his various
      correspondence and frequent journeys, the Roman laurel, and his
      elaborate compositions in prose and verse, in Latin and Italian,
      diverted him from a foreign idiom; and as he advanced in life,
      the attainment of the Greek language was the object of his wishes
      rather than of his hopes. When he was about fifty years of age, a
      Byzantine ambassador, his friend, and a master of both tongues,
      presented him with a copy of Homer; and the answer of Petrarch is
      at one expressive of his eloquence, gratitude, and regret. After
      celebrating the generosity of the donor, and the value of a gift
      more precious in his estimation than gold or rubies, he thus
      proceeds: “Your present of the genuine and original text of the
      divine poet, the fountain of all inventions, is worthy of
      yourself and of me: you have fulfilled your promise, and
      satisfied my desires. Yet your liberality is still imperfect:
      with Homer you should have given me yourself; a guide, who could
      lead me into the fields of light, and disclose to my wondering
      eyes the spacious miracles of the Iliad and Odyssey. But, alas!
      Homer is dumb, or I am deaf; nor is it in my power to enjoy the
      beauty which I possess. I have seated him by the side of Plato,
      the prince of poets near the prince of philosophers; and I glory
      in the sight of my illustrious guests. Of their immortal
      writings, whatever had been translated into the Latin idiom, I
      had already acquired; but, if there be no profit, there is some
      pleasure, in beholding these venerable Greeks in their proper and
      national habit. I am delighted with the aspect of Homer; and as
      often as I embrace the silent volume, I exclaim with a sigh,
      Illustrious bard! with what pleasure should I listen to thy song,
      if my sense of hearing were not obstructed and lost by the death
      of one friend, and in the much-lamented absence of another. Nor
      do I yet despair; and the example of Cato suggests some comfort
      and hope, since it was in the last period of age that he attained
      the knowledge of the Greek letters.” 92

      et qualis divino illi profluxit ingenio.... Sine tuâ voce Homerus
      tuus apud me mutus, immo vero ego apud illum surdus sum. Gaudeo
      tamen vel adspectû solo, ac sæpe illum amplexus atque suspirans
      dico, O magne vir, &c.]

      The prize which eluded the efforts of Petrarch, was obtained by
      the fortune and industry of his friend Boccace, 93 the father of
      the Tuscan prose. That popular writer, who derives his reputation
      from the Decameron, a hundred novels of pleasantry and love, may
      aspire to the more serious praise of restoring in Italy the study
      of the Greek language. In the year one thousand three hundred and
      sixty, a disciple of Barlaam, whose name was Leo, or Leontius
      Pilatus, was detained in his way to Avignon by the advice and
      hospitality of Boccace, who lodged the stranger in his house,
      prevailed on the republic of Florence to allow him an annual
      stipend, and devoted his leisure to the first Greek professor,
      who taught that language in the Western countries of Europe. The
      appearance of Leo might disgust the most eager disciple, he was
      clothed in the mantle of a philosopher, or a mendicant; his
      countenance was hideous; his face was overshadowed with black
      hair; his beard long and uncombed; his deportment rustic; his
      temper gloomy and inconstant; nor could he grace his discourse
      with the ornaments, or even the perspicuity, of Latin elocution.
      But his mind was stored with a treasure of Greek learning:
      history and fable, philosophy and grammar, were alike at his
      command; and he read the poems of Homer in the schools of
      Florence. It was from his explanation that Boccace composed 931
      and transcribed a literal prose version of the Iliad and Odyssey,
      which satisfied the thirst of his friend Petrarch, and which,
      perhaps, in the succeeding century, was clandestinely used by
      Laurentius Valla, the Latin interpreter. It was from his
      narratives that the same Boccace collected the materials for his
      treatise on the genealogy of the heathen gods, a work, in that
      age, of stupendous erudition, and which he ostentatiously
      sprinkled with Greek characters and passages, to excite the
      wonder and applause of his more ignorant readers. 94 The first
      steps of learning are slow and laborious; no more than ten
      votaries of Homer could be enumerated in all Italy; and neither
      Rome, nor Venice, nor Naples, could add a single name to this
      studious catalogue. But their numbers would have multiplied,
      their progress would have been accelerated, if the inconstant
      Leo, at the end of three years, had not relinquished an honorable
      and beneficial station. In his passage, Petrarch entertained him
      at Padua a short time: he enjoyed the scholar, but was justly
      offended with the gloomy and unsocial temper of the man.
      Discontented with the world and with himself, Leo depreciated his
      present enjoyments, while absent persons and objects were dear to
      his imagination. In Italy he was a Thessalian, in Greece a native
      of Calabria: in the company of the Latins he disdained their
      language, religion, and manners: no sooner was he landed at
      Constantinople, than he again sighed for the wealth of Venice and
      the elegance of Florence. His Italian friends were deaf to his
      importunity: he depended on their curiosity and indulgence, and
      embarked on a second voyage; but on his entrance into the
      Adriatic, the ship was assailed by a tempest, and the unfortunate
      teacher, who like Ulysses had fastened himself to the mast, was
      struck dead by a flash of lightning. The humane Petrarch dropped
      a tear on his disaster; but he was most anxious to learn whether
      some copy of Euripides or Sophocles might not be saved from the
      hands of the mariners. 95

      be consulted. The editions, versions, imitations of his novels,
      are innumerable. Yet he was ashamed to communicate that trifling,
      and perhaps scandalous, work to Petrarch, his respectable friend,
      in whose letters and memoirs he conspicuously appears.]

      Nonne ego fui qui Leontium Pilatum, &c., (de Genealogia Deorum,

      caught the lively and dramatic manner of his original.]

      But the faint rudiments of Greek learning, which Petrarch had
      encouraged and Boccace had planted, soon withered and expired.
      The succeeding generation was content for a while with the
      improvement of Latin eloquence; nor was it before the end of the
      fourteenth century that a new and perpetual flame was rekindled
      in Italy. 96 Previous to his own journey the emperor Manuel
      despatched his envoys and orators to implore the compassion of
      the Western princes. Of these envoys, the most conspicuous, or
      the most learned, was Manuel Chrysoloras, 97 of noble birth, and
      whose Roman ancestors are supposed to have migrated with the
      great Constantine. After visiting the courts of France and
      England, where he obtained some contributions and more promises,
      the envoy was invited to assume the office of a professor; and
      Florence had again the honor of this second invitation. By his
      knowledge, not only of the Greek, but of the Latin tongue,
      Chrysoloras deserved the stipend, and surpassed the expectation,
      of the republic. His school was frequented by a crowd of
      disciples of every rank and age; and one of these, in a general
      history, has described his motives and his success. “At that
      time,” says Leonard Aretin, 98 “I was a student of the civil law;
      but my soul was inflamed with the love of letters; and I bestowed
      some application on the sciences of logic and rhetoric. On the
      arrival of Manuel, I hesitated whether I should desert my legal
      studies, or relinquish this golden opportunity; and thus, in the
      ardor of youth, I communed with my own mind—Wilt thou be wanting
      to thyself and thy fortune? Wilt thou refuse to be introduced to
      a familiar converse with Homer, Plato, and Demosthenes; with
      those poets, philosophers, and orators, of whom such wonders are
      related, and who are celebrated by every age as the great masters
      of human science? Of professors and scholars in civil law, a
      sufficient supply will always be found in our universities; but a
      teacher, and such a teacher, of the Greek language, if he once be
      suffered to escape, may never afterwards be retrieved. Convinced
      by these reasons, I gave myself to Chrysoloras; and so strong was
      my passion, that the lessons which I had imbibed in the day were
      the constant object of my nightly dreams.” 99 At the same time
      and place, the Latin classics were explained by John of Ravenna,
      the domestic pupil of Petrarch; 100 the Italians, who illustrated
      their age and country, were formed in this double school; and
      Florence became the fruitful seminary of Greek and Roman
      erudition. 101 The presence of the emperor recalled Chrysoloras
      from the college to the court; but he afterwards taught at Pavia
      and Rome with equal industry and applause. The remainder of his
      life, about fifteen years, was divided between Italy and
      Constantinople, between embassies and lessons. In the noble
      office of enlightening a foreign nation, the grammarian was not
      unmindful of a more sacred duty to his prince and country; and
      Emanuel Chrysoloras died at Constance on a public mission from
      the emperor to the council.

      96 (return) [ Dr. Hody (p. 54) is angry with Leonard Aretin,
      Guarinus, Paulus Jovius, &c., for affirming, that the Greek
      letters were restored in Italy _post septingentos annos_; as if,
      says he, they had flourished till the end of the viith century.
      These writers most probably reckoned from the last period of the
      exarchate; and the presence of the Greek magistrates and troops
      at Ravenna and Rome must have preserved, in some degree, the use
      of their native tongue.]

      Aretinus, the disciple of Chrysoloras, was a linguist, an orator,
      and an historian, the secretary of four successive popes, and the
      chancellor of the republic of Florence, where he died A.D. 1444,
      at the age of seventy-five, (Fabric. Bibliot. Medii Ævi, tom. i.

      100 (return) [ In this domestic discipline, Petrarch, who loved
      the youth, often complains of the eager curiosity, restless
      temper, and proud feelings, which announce the genius and glory
      of a riper age, (Mémoires sur Pétrarque, tom. iii. p. 700—709.)]

      101 (return) [ Hinc Græcæ Latinæque scholæ exortæ sunt, Guarino
      Philelpho, Leonardo Aretino, Caroloque, ac plerisque aliis
      tanquam ex equo Trojano prodeuntibus, quorum emulatione multa
      ingenia deinceps ad laudem excitata sunt, (Platina in Bonifacio
      IX.) Another Italian writer adds the names of Paulus Petrus
      Vergerius, Omnibonus Vincentius, Poggius, Franciscus Barbarus,
      &c. But I question whether a rigid chronology would allow
      Chrysoloras _all_ these eminent scholars, (Hodius, p. 25—27,
      &c.)]

      After his example, the restoration of the Greek letters in Italy
      was prosecuted by a series of emigrants, who were destitute of
      fortune, and endowed with learning, or at least with language.
      From the terror or oppression of the Turkish arms, the natives of
      Thessalonica and Constantinople escaped to a land of freedom,
      curiosity, and wealth. The synod introduced into Florence the
      lights of the Greek church, and the oracles of the Platonic
      philosophy; and the fugitives who adhered to the union, had the
      double merit of renouncing their country, not only for the
      Christian, but for the catholic cause. A patriot, who sacrifices
      his party and conscience to the allurements of favor, may be
      possessed, however, of the private and social virtues: he no
      longer hears the reproachful epithets of slave and apostate; and
      the consideration which he acquires among his new associates will
      restore in his own eyes the dignity of his character. The prudent
      conformity of Bessarion was rewarded with the Roman purple: he
      fixed his residence in Italy; and the Greek cardinal, the titular
      patriarch of Constantinople, was respected as the chief and
      protector of his nation: 102 his abilities were exercised in the
      legations of Bologna, Venice, Germany, and France; and his
      election to the chair of St. Peter floated for a moment on the
      uncertain breath of a conclave. 103 His ecclesiastical honors
      diffused a splendor and preeminence over his literary merit and
      service: his palace was a school; as often as the cardinal
      visited the Vatican, he was attended by a learned train of both
      nations; 104 of men applauded by themselves and the public; and
      whose writings, now overspread with dust, were popular and useful
      in their own times. I shall not attempt to enumerate the
      restorers of Grecian literature in the fifteenth century; and it
      may be sufficient to mention with gratitude the names of Theodore
      Gaza, of George of Trebizond, of John Argyropulus, and Demetrius
      Chalcocondyles, who taught their native language in the schools
      of Florence and Rome. Their labors were not inferior to those of
      Bessarion, whose purple they revered, and whose fortune was the
      secret object of their envy. But the lives of these grammarians
      were humble and obscure: they had declined the lucrative paths of
      the church; their dress and manners secluded them from the
      commerce of the world; and since they were confined to the merit,
      they might be content with the rewards, of learning. From this
      character, Janus Lascaris 105 will deserve an exception. His
      eloquence, politeness, and Imperial descent, recommended him to
      the French monarch; and in the same cities he was alternately
      employed to teach and to negotiate. Duty and interest prompted
      them to cultivate the study of the Latin language; and the most
      successful attained the faculty of writing and speaking with
      fluency and elegance in a foreign idiom. But they ever retained
      the inveterate vanity of their country: their praise, or at least
      their esteem, was reserved for the national writers, to whom they
      owed their fame and subsistence; and they sometimes betrayed
      their contempt in licentious criticism or satire on Virgil’s
      poetry, and the oratory of Tully. 106 The superiority of these
      masters arose from the familiar use of a living language; and
      their first disciples were incapable of discerning how far they
      had degenerated from the knowledge, and even the practice of
      their ancestors. A vicious pronunciation, 107 which they
      introduced, was banished from the schools by the reason of the
      succeeding age. Of the power of the Greek accents they were
      ignorant; and those musical notes, which, from an Attic tongue,
      and to an Attic ear, must have been the secret soul of harmony,
      were to their eyes, as to our own, no more than minute and
      unmeaning marks, in prose superfluous and troublesome in verse.
      The art of grammar they truly possessed; the valuable fragments
      of Apollonius and Herodian were transfused into their lessons;
      and their treatises of syntax and etymology, though devoid of
      philosophic spirit, are still useful to the Greek student. In the
      shipwreck of the Byzantine libraries, each fugitive seized a
      fragment of treasure, a copy of some author, who without his
      industry might have perished: the transcripts were multiplied by
      an assiduous, and sometimes an elegant pen; and the text was
      corrected and explained by their own comments, or those of the
      elder scholiasts. The sense, though not the spirit, of the Greek
      classics, was interpreted to the Latin world: the beauties of
      style evaporate in a version; but the judgment of Theodore Gaza
      selected the more solid works of Aristotle and Theophrastus, and
      their natural histories of animals and plants opened a rich fund
      of genuine and experimental science.

      105 (return) [ He was born before the taking of Constantinople,
      but his honorable life was stretched far into the xvith century,
      (A.D. 1535.) Leo X. and Francis I. were his noblest patrons,
      under whose auspices he founded the Greek colleges of Rome and
      Paris, (Hody, p. 247—275.) He left posterity in France; but the
      counts de Vintimille, and their numerous branches, derive the
      name of Lascaris from a doubtful marriage in the xiiith century
      with the daughter of a Greek emperor (Ducange, Fam. Byzant. p.
      224—230.)]

      106 (return) [ Two of his epigrams against Virgil, and three
      against Tully, are preserved and refuted by Franciscus Floridus,
      who can find no better names than Græculus ineptus et impudens,
      (Hody, p. 274.) In our own times, an English critic has accused
      the Æneid of containing multa languida, nugatoria, spiritû et
      majestate carminis heroici defecta; many such verses as he, the
      said Jeremiah Markland, would have been ashamed of owning,
      (præfat. ad Statii Sylvas, p. 21, 22.)]

      107 (return) [ Emanuel Chrysoloras, and his colleagues, are
      accused of ignorance, envy, or avarice, (Sylloge, &c., tom. ii.
      p. 235.) The modern Greeks pronounce the b as a V consonant, and
      confound three vowels, (h i u,) and several diphthongs. Such was
      the vulgar pronunciation which the stern Gardiner maintained by
      penal statutes in the university of Cambridge: but the
      monosyllable bh represented to an Attic ear the bleating of
      sheep, and a bellwether is better evidence than a bishop or a
      chancellor. The treatises of those scholars, particularly
      Erasmus, who asserted a more classical pronunciation, are
      collected in the Sylloge of Havercamp, (2 vols. in octavo, Lugd.
      Bat. 1736, 1740:) but it is difficult to paint sounds by words:
      and in their reference to modern use, they can be understood only
      by their respective countrymen. We may observe, that our peculiar
      pronunciation of the O, th, is approved by Erasmus, (tom. ii. p.
      130.)]

      Yet the fleeting shadows of metaphysics were pursued with more
      curiosity and ardor. After a long oblivion, Plato was revived in
      Italy by a venerable Greek, 108 who taught in the house of Cosmo
      of Medicis. While the synod of Florence was involved in
      theological debate, some beneficial consequences might flow from
      the study of his elegant philosophy: his style is the purest
      standard of the Attic dialect, and his sublime thoughts are
      sometimes adapted to familiar conversation, and sometimes adorned
      with the richest colors of poetry and eloquence. The dialogues of
      Plato are a dramatic picture of the life and death of a sage;
      and, as often as he descends from the clouds, his moral system
      inculcates the love of truth, of our country, and of mankind. The
      precept and example of Socrates recommended a modest doubt and
      liberal inquiry; and if the Platonists, with blind devotion,
      adored the visions and errors of their divine master, their
      enthusiasm might correct the dry, dogmatic method of the
      Peripatetic school. So equal, yet so opposite, are the merits of
      Plato and Aristotle, that they may be balanced in endless
      controversy; but some spark of freedom may be produced by the
      collision of adverse servitude. The modern Greeks were divided
      between the two sects: with more fury than skill they fought
      under the banner of their leaders; and the field of battle was
      removed in their flight from Constantinople to Rome. But this
      philosophical debate soon degenerated into an angry and personal
      quarrel of grammarians; and Bessarion, though an advocate for
      Plato, protected the national honor, by interposing the advice
      and authority of a mediator. In the gardens of the Medici, the
      academical doctrine was enjoyed by the polite and learned: but
      their philosophic society was quickly dissolved; and if the
      writings of the Attic sage were perused in the closet, the more
      powerful Stagyrite continued to reign, the oracle of the church
      and school. 109

      his days in Peloponnesus. See the curious Diatribe of Leo
      Allatius de Georgiis, in Fabricius. (Bibliot. Græc. tom. x. p.
      739—756.)]

      109 (return) [ The state of the Platonic philosophy in Italy is
      illustrated by Boivin, (Mém. de l’Acad. des Inscriptions, tom.
      ii. p. 715—729,) and Tiraboschi, (tom. vi. P. i. p. 259—288.)]

      I have fairly represented the literary merits of the Greeks; yet
      it must be confessed, that they were seconded and surpassed by
      the ardor of the Latins. Italy was divided into many independent
      states; and at that time it was the ambition of princes and
      republics to vie with each other in the encouragement and reward
      of literature. The fame of Nicholas the Fifth 110 has not been
      adequate to his merits. From a plebeian origin he raised himself
      by his virtue and learning: the character of the man prevailed
      over the interest of the pope; and he sharpened those weapons
      which were soon pointed against the Roman church. 111 He had been
      the friend of the most eminent scholars of the age: he became
      their patron; and such was the humility of his manners, that the
      change was scarcely discernible either to them or to himself. If
      he pressed the acceptance of a liberal gift, it was not as the
      measure of desert, but as the proof of benevolence; and when
      modest merit declined his bounty, “Accept it,” would he say, with
      a consciousness of his own worth: “ye will not always have a
      Nicholas among you.” The influence of the holy see pervaded
      Christendom; and he exerted that influence in the search, not of
      benefices, but of books. From the ruins of the Byzantine
      libraries, from the darkest monasteries of Germany and Britain,
      he collected the dusty manuscripts of the writers of antiquity;
      and wherever the original could not be removed, a faithful copy
      was transcribed and transmitted for his use. The Vatican, the old
      repository for bulls and legends, for superstition and forgery,
      was daily replenished with more precious furniture; and such was
      the industry of Nicholas, that in a reign of eight years he
      formed a library of five thousand volumes. To his munificence the
      Latin world was indebted for the versions of Xenophon, Diodorus,
      Polybius, Thucydides, Herodotus, and Appian; of Strabo’s
      Geography, of the Iliad, of the most valuable works of Plato and
      Aristotle, of Ptolemy and Theophrastus, and of the fathers of the
      Greek church. The example of the Roman pontiff was preceded or
      imitated by a Florentine merchant, who governed the republic
      without arms and without a title. Cosmo of Medicis 112 was the
      father of a line of princes, whose name and age are almost
      synonymous with the restoration of learning: his credit was
      ennobled into fame; his riches were dedicated to the service of
      mankind; he corresponded at once with Cairo and London: and a
      cargo of Indian spices and Greek books was often imported in the
      same vessel. The genius and education of his grandson Lorenzo
      rendered him not only a patron, but a judge and candidate, in the
      literary race. In his palace, distress was entitled to relief,
      and merit to reward: his leisure hours were delightfully spent in
      the Platonic academy; he encouraged the emulation of Demetrius
      Chalcocondyles and Angelo Politian; and his active missionary
      Janus Lascaris returned from the East with a treasure of two
      hundred manuscripts, fourscore of which were as yet unknown in
      the libraries of Europe. 113 The rest of Italy was animated by a
      similar spirit, and the progress of the nation repaid the
      liberality of their princes. The Latins held the exclusive
      property of their own literature; and these disciples of Greece
      were soon capable of transmitting and improving the lessons which
      they had imbibed. After a short succession of foreign teachers,
      the tide of emigration subsided; but the language of
      Constantinople was spread beyond the Alps and the natives of
      France, Germany, and England, 114 imparted to their country the
      sacred fire which they had kindled in the schools of Florence and
      Rome. 115 In the productions of the mind, as in those of the
      soil, the gifts of nature are excelled by industry and skill: the
      Greek authors, forgotten on the banks of the Ilissus, have been
      illustrated on those of the Elbe and the Thames: and Bessarion or
      Gaza might have envied the superior science of the Barbarians;
      the accuracy of Budæus, the taste of Erasmus, the copiousness of
      Stephens, the erudition of Scaliger, the discernment of Reiske,
      or of Bentley. On the side of the Latins, the discovery of
      printing was a casual advantage: but this useful art has been
      applied by Aldus, and his innumerable successors, to perpetuate
      and multiply the works of antiquity. 116 A single manuscript
      imported from Greece is revived in ten thousand copies; and each
      copy is fairer than the original. In this form, Homer and Plato
      would peruse with more satisfaction their own writings; and their
      scholiasts must resign the prize to the labors of our Western
      editors.

      time; several containing different treatises and authors, and of
      several authors, two, three, or four editions, (Fabric. Bibliot.
      Græc. tom. xiii. p. 605, &c.) Yet his glory must not tempt us to
      forget, that the first Greek book, the Grammar of Constantine
      Lascaris, was printed at Milan in 1476; and that the Florence
      Homer of 1488 displays all the luxury of the typographical art.

      Instructive of De Bure, a knowing bookseller of Paris.]

      Before the revival of classic literature, the Barbarians in
      Europe were immersed in ignorance; and their vulgar tongues were
      marked with the rudeness and poverty of their manners. The
      students of the more perfect idioms of Rome and Greece were
      introduced to a new world of light and science; to the society of
      the free and polished nations of antiquity; and to a familiar
      converse with those immortal men who spoke the sublime language
      of eloquence and reason. Such an intercourse must tend to refine
      the taste, and to elevate the genius, of the moderns; and yet,
      from the first experiments, it might appear that the study of the
      ancients had given fetters, rather than wings, to the human mind.
      However laudable, the spirit of imitation is of a servile cast;
      and the first disciples of the Greeks and Romans were a colony of
      strangers in the midst of their age and country. The minute and
      laborious diligence which explored the antiquities of remote
      times might have improved or adorned the present state of
      society, the critic and metaphysician were the slaves of
      Aristotle; the poets, historians, and orators, were proud to
      repeat the thoughts and words of the Augustan age: the works of
      nature were observed with the eyes of Pliny and Theophrastus; and
      some Pagan votaries professed a secret devotion to the gods of
      Homer and Plato. 117 The Italians were oppressed by the strength
      and number of their ancient auxiliaries: the century after the
      deaths of Petrarch and Boccace was filled with a crowd of Latin
      imitators, who decently repose on our shelves; but in that æra of
      learning it will not be easy to discern a real discovery of
      science, a work of invention or eloquence, in the popular
      language of the country. 118 But as soon as it had been deeply
      saturated with the celestial dew, the soil was quickened into
      vegetation and life; the modern idioms were refined; the classics
      of Athens and Rome inspired a pure taste and a generous
      emulation; and in Italy, as afterwards in France and England, the
      pleasing reign of poetry and fiction was succeeded by the light
      of speculative and experimental philosophy. Genius may anticipate
      the season of maturity; but in the education of a people, as in
      that of an individual, memory must be exercised, before the
      powers of reason and fancy can be expanded: nor may the artist
      hope to equal or surpass, till he has learned to imitate, the
      works of his predecessors.

      117 (return) [ I will select three singular examples of this
      classic enthusiasm. I. At the synod of Florence, Gemistus Pletho
      said, in familiar conversation to George of Trebizond, that in a
      short time mankind would unanimously renounce the Gospel and the
      Koran, for a religion similar to that of the Gentiles, (Leo
      Allatius, apud Fabricium, tom. x. p. 751.) 2. Paul II. persecuted
      the Roman academy, which had been founded by Pomponius Lætus; and
      the principal members were accused of heresy, impiety, and
      _paganism_, (Tiraboschi, tom. vi. P. i. p. 81, 82.) 3. In the
      next century, some scholars and poets in France celebrated the
      success of Jodelle’s tragedy of Cleopatra, by a festival of
      Bacchus, and, as it is said, by the sacrifice of a goat, (Bayle,
      Dictionnaire, Jodelle. Fontenelle, tom. iii. p. 56—61.) Yet the
      spirit of bigotry might often discern a serious impiety in the
      sportive play of fancy and learning.]

      118 (return) [ The survivor Boccace died in the year 1375; and we
      cannot place before 1480 the composition of the Morgante Maggiore

      vi. P. ii. p. 174—177.)]
