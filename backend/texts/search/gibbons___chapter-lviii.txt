      About twenty years after the conquest of Jerusalem by the Turks,
      the holy sepulchre was visited by a hermit of the name of Peter,
      a native of Amiens, in the province of Picardy 1 in France. His
      resentment and sympathy were excited by his own injuries and the
      oppression of the Christian name; he mingled his tears with those
      of the patriarch, and earnestly inquired, if no hopes of relief
      could be entertained from the Greek emperors of the East. The
      patriarch exposed the vices and weakness of the successors of
      Constantine. “I will rouse,” exclaimed the hermit, “the martial
      nations of Europe in your cause;” and Europe was obedient to the
      call of the hermit. The astonished patriarch dismissed him with
      epistles of credit and complaint; and no sooner did he land at
      Bari, than Peter hastened to kiss the feet of the Roman pontiff.
      His stature was small, his appearance contemptible; but his eye
      was keen and lively; and he possessed that vehemence of speech,
      which seldom fails to impart the persuasion of the soul. 2 He was
      born of a gentleman’s family, (for we must now adopt a modern
      idiom,) and his military service was under the neighboring counts
      of Boulogne, the heroes of the first crusade. But he soon
      relinquished the sword and the world; and if it be true, that his
      wife, however noble, was aged and ugly, he might withdraw, with
      the less reluctance, from her bed to a convent, and at length to
      a hermitage. 211 In this austere solitude, his body was
      emaciated, his fancy was inflamed; whatever he wished, he
      believed; whatever he believed, he saw in dreams and revelations.
      From Jerusalem the pilgrim returned an accomplished fanatic; but
      as he excelled in the popular madness of the times, Pope Urban
      the Second received him as a prophet, applauded his glorious
      design, promised to support it in a general council, and
      encouraged him to proclaim the deliverance of the Holy Land.
      Invigorated by the approbation of the pontiff, his zealous
      missionary traversed. with speed and success, the provinces of
      Italy and France. His diet was abstemious, his prayers long and
      fervent, and the alms which he received with one hand, he
      distributed with the other: his head was bare, his feet naked,
      his meagre body was wrapped in a coarse garment; he bore and
      displayed a weighty crucifix; and the ass on which he rode was
      sanctified, in the public eye, by the service of the man of God.
      He preached to innumerable crowds in the churches, the streets,
      and the highways: the hermit entered with equal confidence the
      palace and the cottage; and the people (for all was people) was
      impetuously moved by his call to repentance and arms. When he
      painted the sufferings of the natives and pilgrims of Palestine,
      every heart was melted to compassion; every breast glowed with
      indignation, when he challenged the warriors of the age to defend
      their brethren, and rescue their Savior: his ignorance of art and
      language was compensated by sighs, and tears, and ejaculations;
      and Peter supplied the deficiency of reason by loud and frequent
      appeals to Christ and his mother, to the saints and angels of
      paradise, with whom he had personally conversed. 212 The most
      perfect orator of Athens might have envied the success of his
      eloquence; the rustic enthusiast inspired the passions which he
      felt, and Christendom expected with impatience the counsels and
      decrees of the supreme pontiff.

      1 (return) [ Whimsical enough is the origin of the name of
      Picards, and from thence of Picardie, which does not date later
      than A.D. 1200. It was an academical joke, an epithet first
      applied to the quarrelsome humor of those students, in the
      University of Paris, who came from the frontier of France and
      Flanders, (Valesii Notitia Galliarum, p. 447, Longuerue.

      The magnanimous spirit of Gregory the Seventh had already
      embraced the design of arming Europe against Asia; the ardor of
      his zeal and ambition still breathes in his epistles: from either
      side of the Alps, fifty thousand Catholics had enlisted under the
      banner of St. Peter; 3 and his successor reveals his intention of
      marching at their head against the impious sectaries of Mahomet.
      But the glory or reproach of executing, though not in person,
      this holy enterprise, was reserved for Urban the Second, 4 the
      most faithful of his disciples. He undertook the conquest of the
      East, whilst the larger portion of Rome was possessed and
      fortified by his rival Guibert of Ravenna, who contended with
      Urban for the name and honors of the pontificate. He attempted to
      unite the powers of the West, at a time when the princes were
      separated from the church, and the people from their princes, by
      the excommunication which himself and his predecessors had
      thundered against the emperor and the king of France. Philip the
      First, of France, supported with patience the censures which he
      had provoked by his scandalous life and adulterous marriage.
      Henry the Fourth, of Germany, asserted the right of investitures,
      the prerogative of confirming his bishops by the delivery of the
      ring and crosier. But the emperor’s party was crushed in Italy by
      the arms of the Normans and the Countess Mathilda; and the long
      quarrel had been recently envenomed by the revolt of his son
      Conrad and the shame of his wife, 5 who, in the synods of
      Constance and Placentia, confessed the manifold prostitutions to
      which she had been exposed by a husband regardless of her honor
      and his own. 6 So popular was the cause of Urban, so weighty was
      his influence, that the council which he summoned at Placentia 7
      was composed of two hundred bishops of Italy, France, Burgandy,
      Swabia, and Bavaria. Four thousand of the clergy, and thirty
      thousand of the laity, attended this important meeting; and, as
      the most spacious cathedral would have been inadequate to the
      multitude, the session of seven days was held in a plain adjacent
      to the city. The ambassadors of the Greek emperor, Alexius
      Comnenus, were introduced to plead the distress of their
      sovereign, and the danger of Constantinople, which was divided
      only by a narrow sea from the victorious Turks, the common
      enemies of the Christian name. In their suppliant address they
      flattered the pride of the Latin princes; and, appealing at once
      to their policy and religion, exhorted them to repel the
      Barbarians on the confines of Asia, rather than to expect them in
      the heart of Europe. At the sad tale of the misery and perils of
      their Eastern brethren, the assembly burst into tears; the most
      eager champions declared their readiness to march; and the Greek
      ambassadors were dismissed with the assurance of a speedy and
      powerful succor. The relief of Constantinople was included in the
      larger and most distant project of the deliverance of Jerusalem;
      but the prudent Urban adjourned the final decision to a second
      synod, which he proposed to celebrate in some city of France in
      the autumn of the same year. The short delay would propagate the
      flame of enthusiasm; and his firmest hope was in a nation of
      soldiers 8 still proud of the preeminence of their name, and
      ambitious to emulate their hero Charlemagne, 9 who, in the
      popular romance of Turpin, 10 had achieved the conquest of the
      Holy Land. A latent motive of affection or vanity might influence
      the choice of Urban: he was himself a native of France, a monk of
      Clugny, and the first of his countrymen who ascended the throne
      of St. Peter. The pope had illustrated his family and province;
      nor is there perhaps a more exquisite gratification than to
      revisit, in a conspicuous dignity, the humble and laborious
      scenes of our youth.

      and council. These abominations are repugnant to every principle
      of human nature, which is not altered by a dispute about rings
      and crosiers. Yet it should seem, that the wretched woman was
      tempted by the priests to relate or subscribe some infamous
      stories of herself and her husband.]

      videamus, non illico Francos homines appellemus? (p. 478.) He
      owns, however, that the vivacity of the French degenerates into
      petulance among foreigners, (p. 488.) and vain loquaciousness,
      (p. 502.)]

      10 (return) [ John Tilpinus, or Turpinus, was archbishop of
      Rheims, A.D. 773. After the year 1000, this romance was composed
      in his name, by a monk of the borders of France and Spain; and
      such was the idea of ecclesiastical merit, that he describes
      himself as a fighting and drinking priest! Yet the book of lies
      was pronounced authentic by Pope Calixtus II., (A.D. 1122,) and
      is respectfully quoted by the abbot Suger, in the great
      Chronicles of St. Denys, (Fabric Bibliot. Latin Medii Aevi, edit.
      Mansi, tom. iv. p. 161.)]

      It may occasion some surprise that the Roman pontiff should
      erect, in the heart of France, the tribunal from whence he hurled
      his anathemas against the king; but our surprise will vanish so
      soon as we form a just estimate of a king of France of the
      eleventh century. 11 Philip the First was the great-grandson of
      Hugh Capet, the founder of the present race, who, in the decline
      of Charlemagne’s posterity, added the regal title to his
      patrimonial estates of Paris and Orleans. In this narrow compass,
      he was possessed of wealth and jurisdiction; but in the rest of
      France, Hugh and his first descendants were no more than the
      feudal lords of about sixty dukes and counts, of independent and
      hereditary power, 12 who disdained the control of laws and legal
      assemblies, and whose disregard of their sovereign was revenged
      by the disobedience of their inferior vassals. At Clermont, in
      the territories of the count of Auvergne, 13 the pope might brave
      with impunity the resentment of Philip; and the council which he
      convened in that city was not less numerous or respectable than
      the synod of Placentia. 14 Besides his court and council of Roman
      cardinals, he was supported by thirteen archbishops and two
      hundred and twenty-five bishops: the number of mitred prelates
      was computed at four hundred; and the fathers of the church were
      blessed by the saints and enlightened by the doctors of the age.
      From the adjacent kingdoms, a martial train of lords and knights
      of power and renown attended the council, 15 in high expectation
      of its resolves; and such was the ardor of zeal and curiosity,
      that the city was filled, and many thousands, in the month of
      November, erected their tents or huts in the open field. A
      session of eight days produced some useful or edifying canons for
      the reformation of manners; a severe censure was pronounced
      against the license of private war; the Truce of God 16 was
      confirmed, a suspension of hostilities during four days of the
      week; women and priests were placed under the safeguard of the
      church; and a protection of three years was extended to
      husbandmen and merchants, the defenceless victims of military
      rapine. But a law, however venerable be the sanction, cannot
      suddenly transform the temper of the times; and the benevolent
      efforts of Urban deserve the less praise, since he labored to
      appease some domestic quarrels that he might spread the flames of
      war from the Atlantic to the Euphrates. From the synod of
      Placentia, the rumor of his great design had gone forth among the
      nations: the clergy on their return had preached in every diocese
      the merit and glory of the deliverance of the Holy Land; and when
      the pope ascended a lofty scaffold in the market-place of
      Clermont, his eloquence was addressed to a well-prepared and
      impatient audience. His topics were obvious, his exhortation was
      vehement, his success inevitable. The orator was interrupted by
      the shout of thousands, who with one voice, and in their rustic
      idiom, exclaimed aloud, “God wills it, God wills it.” 17 “It is
      indeed the will of God,” replied the pope; “and let this
      memorable word, the inspiration surely of the Holy Spirit, be
      forever adopted as your cry of battle, to animate the devotion
      and courage of the champions of Christ. His cross is the symbol
      of your salvation; wear it, a red, a bloody cross, as an external
      mark, on your breasts or shoulders, as a pledge of your sacred
      and irrevocable engagement.” The proposal was joyfully accepted;
      great numbers, both of the clergy and laity, impressed on their
      garments the sign of the cross, 18 and solicited the pope to
      march at their head. This dangerous honor was declined by the
      more prudent successor of Gregory, who alleged the schism of the
      church, and the duties of his pastoral office, recommending to
      the faithful, who were disqualified by sex or profession, by age
      or infirmity, to aid, with their prayers and alms, the personal
      service of their robust brethren. The name and powers of his
      legate he devolved on Adhemar bishop of Puy, the first who had
      received the cross at his hands. The foremost of the temporal
      chiefs was Raymond count of Thoulouse, whose ambassadors in the
      council excused the absence, and pledged the honor, of their
      master. After the confession and absolution of their sins, the
      champions of the cross were dismissed with a superfluous
      admonition to invite their countrymen and friends; and their
      departure for the Holy Land was fixed to the festival of the
      Assumption, the fifteenth of August, of the ensuing year. 19

      it was corrupted to Deus lo volt, or Diex el volt. See Chron.

      appears the favorite, and as if were, the national, color of our
      military ensigns and uniforms.]

      19 (return) [ Bongarsius, who has published the original writers
      of the crusades, adopts, with much complacency, the fanatic title
      of Guibertus, Gesta Dei per Francos; though some critics propose
      to read Gesta Diaboli per Francos, (Hanoviae, 1611, two vols. in
      folio.) I shall briefly enumerate, as they stand in this
      collection, the authors whom I have used for the first crusade.

     I.    Gesta Francorum.
     II.   Robertus Monachus.
     III.  Baldricus.
     IV.   Raimundus de Agiles.
     V.    Albertus Aquensis VI. Fulcherius Carnotensis.
     VII.  Guibertus.
     VIII. Willielmus Tyriensis. Muratori has given us,
     IX.   Radulphus Cadomensis de Gestis Tancredi,
     (Script. Rer. Ital. tom. v. p. 285-333,)
     X.    Bernardus Thesaurarius de Acquisitione Terrae Sanctae,
         (tom. vii. p. 664-848.)

      The last of these was unknown to a late French historian, who has
      given a large and critical list of the writers of the crusades,
      (Esprit des Croisades, tom. i. p. 13-141,) and most of whose
      judgments my own experience will allow me to ratify. It was late
      before I could obtain a sight of the French historians collected
      by Duchesne. I. Petri Tudebodi Sacerdotis Sivracensis Historia de
      Hierosolymitano Itinere, (tom. iv. p. 773-815,) has been
      transfused into the first anonymous writer of Bongarsius. II. The
      Metrical History of the first Crusade, in vii. books, (p.
      890-912,) is of small value or account. * Note: Several new
      documents, particularly from the East, have been collected by the
      industry of the modern historians of the crusades, M. Michaud and
      Wilken.—M.]

      So familiar, and as it were so natural to man, is the practice of
      violence, that our indulgence allows the slightest provocation,
      the most disputable right, as a sufficient ground of national
      hostility. But the name and nature of a holy war demands a more
      rigorous scrutiny; nor can we hastily believe, that the servants
      of the Prince of Peace would unsheathe the sword of destruction,
      unless the motive were pure, the quarrel legitimate, and the
      necessity inevitable. The policy of an action may be determined
      from the tardy lessons of experience; but, before we act, our
      conscience should be satisfied of the justice and propriety of
      our enterprise. In the age of the crusades, the Christians, both
      of the East and West, were persuaded of their lawfulness and
      merit; their arguments are clouded by the perpetual abuse of
      Scripture and rhetoric; but they seem to insist on the right of
      natural and religious defence, their peculiar title to the Holy
      Land, and the impiety of their Pagan and Mahometan foes. 20

      I. The right of a just defence may fairly include our civil and
      spiritual allies: it depends on the existence of danger; and that
      danger must be estimated by the twofold consideration of the
      malice, and the power, of our enemies. A pernicious tenet has
      been imputed to the Mahometans, the duty of extirpating all other
      religions by the sword. This charge of ignorance and bigotry is
      refuted by the Koran, by the history of the Mussulman conquerors,
      and by their public and legal toleration of the Christian
      worship. But it cannot be denied, that the Oriental churches are
      depressed under their iron yoke; that, in peace and war, they
      assert a divine and indefeasible claim of universal empire; and
      that, in their orthodox creed, the unbelieving nations are
      continually threatened with the loss of religion or liberty. In
      the eleventh century, the victorious arms of the Turks presented
      a real and urgent apprehension of these losses. They had subdued,
      in less than thirty years, the kingdoms of Asia, as far as
      Jerusalem and the Hellespont; and the Greek empire tottered on
      the verge of destruction. Besides an honest sympathy for their
      brethren, the Latins had a right and interest in the support of
      Constantinople, the most important barrier of the West; and the
      privilege of defence must reach to prevent, as well as to repel,
      an impending assault. But this salutary purpose might have been
      accomplished by a moderate succor; and our calmer reason must
      disclaim the innumerable hosts, and remote operations, which
      overwhelmed Asia and depopulated Europe. 2011

      20 (return) [ If the reader will turn to the first scene of the
      First Part of Henry the Fourth, he will see in the text of
      Shakespeare the natural feelings of enthusiasm; and in the notes
      of Dr. Johnson the workings of a bigoted, though vigorous mind,
      greedy of every pretence to hate and persecute those who dissent
      from his creed.]

      2011 (return) [ The manner in which the war was conducted surely
      has little relation to the abstract question of the justice or
      injustice of the war. The most just and necessary war may be
      conducted with the most prodigal waste of human life, and the
      wildest fanaticism; the most unjust with the coolest moderation
      and consummate generalship. The question is, whether the
      liberties and religion of Europe were in danger from the
      aggressions of Mahometanism? If so, it is difficult to limit the
      right, though it may be proper to question the wisdom, of
      overwhelming the enemy with the armed population of a whole
      continent, and repelling, if possible, the invading conqueror
      into his native deserts. The crusades are monuments of human
      folly! but to which of the more regular wars civilized. Europe,
      waged for personal ambition or national jealousy, will our calmer
      reason appeal as monuments either of human justice or human
      wisdom?—M.]

      II. Palestine could add nothing to the strength or safety of the
      Latins; and fanaticism alone could pretend to justify the
      conquest of that distant and narrow province. The Christians
      affirmed that their inalienable title to the promised land had
      been sealed by the blood of their divine Savior; it was their
      right and duty to rescue their inheritance from the unjust
      possessors, who profaned his sepulchre, and oppressed the
      pilgrimage of his disciples. Vainly would it be alleged that the
      preeminence of Jerusalem, and the sanctity of Palestine, have
      been abolished with the Mosaic law; that the God of the
      Christians is not a local deity, and that the recovery of Bethlem
      or Calvary, his cradle or his tomb, will not atone for the
      violation of the moral precepts of the gospel. Such arguments
      glance aside from the leaden shield of superstition; and the
      religious mind will not easily relinquish its hold on the sacred
      ground of mystery and miracle.

      III. But the holy wars which have been waged in every climate of
      the globe, from Egypt to Livonia, and from Peru to Hindostan,
      require the support of some more general and flexible tenet. It
      has been often supposed, and sometimes affirmed, that a
      difference of religion is a worthy cause of hostility; that
      obstinate unbelievers may be slain or subdued by the champions of
      the cross; and that grace is the sole fountain of dominion as
      well as of mercy. 2012 Above four hundred years before the first
      crusade, the eastern and western provinces of the Roman empire
      had been acquired about the same time, and in the same manner, by
      the Barbarians of Germany and Arabia. Time and treaties had
      legitimated the conquest of the Christian Franks; but in the eyes
      of their subjects and neighbors, the Mahometan princes were still
      tyrants and usurpers, who, by the arms of war or rebellion, might
      be lawfully driven from their unlawful possession. 21

      p. 63.—M.]

      21 (return) [ The vith Discourse of Fleury on Ecclesiastical
      History (p. 223-261) contains an accurate and rational view of
      the causes and effects of the crusades.]

      As the manners of the Christians were relaxed, their discipline
      of penance 22 was enforced; and with the multiplication of sins,
      the remedies were multiplied. In the primitive church, a
      voluntary and open confession prepared the work of atonement. In
      the middle ages, the bishops and priests interrogated the
      criminal; compelled him to account for his thoughts, words, and
      actions; and prescribed the terms of his reconciliation with God.
      But as this discretionary power might alternately be abused by
      indulgence and tyranny, a rule of discipline was framed, to
      inform and regulate the spiritual judges. This mode of
      legislation was invented by the Greeks; their penitentials 23
      were translated, or imitated, in the Latin church; and, in the
      time of Charlemagne, the clergy of every diocese were provided
      with a code, which they prudently concealed from the knowledge of
      the vulgar. In this dangerous estimate of crimes and punishments,
      each case was supposed, each difference was remarked, by the
      experience or penetration of the monks; some sins are enumerated
      which innocence could not have suspected, and others which reason
      cannot believe; and the more ordinary offences of fornication and
      adultery, of perjury and sacrilege, of rapine and murder, were
      expiated by a penance, which, according to the various
      circumstances, was prolonged from forty days to seven years.
      During this term of mortification, the patient was healed, the
      criminal was absolved, by a salutary regimen of fasts and
      prayers: the disorder of his dress was expressive of grief and
      remorse; and he humbly abstained from all the business and
      pleasure of social life. But the rigid execution of these laws
      would have depopulated the palace, the camp, and the city; the
      Barbarians of the West believed and trembled; but nature often
      rebelled against principle; and the magistrate labored without
      effect to enforce the jurisdiction of the priest. A literal
      accomplishment of penance was indeed impracticable: the guilt of
      adultery was multiplied by daily repetition; that of homicide
      might involve the massacre of a whole people; each act was
      separately numbered; and, in those times of anarchy and vice, a
      modest sinner might easily incur a debt of three hundred years.
      His insolvency was relieved by a commutation, or indulgence: a
      year of penance was appreciated at twenty-six solidi 24 of
      silver, about four pounds sterling, for the rich; at three
      solidi, or nine shillings, for the indigent: and these alms were
      soon appropriated to the use of the church, which derived, from
      the redemption of sins, an inexhaustible source of opulence and
      dominion. A debt of three hundred years, or twelve hundred
      pounds, was enough to impoverish a plentiful fortune; the
      scarcity of gold and silver was supplied by the alienation of
      land; and the princely donations of Pepin and Charlemagne are
      expressly given for the remedy of their soul. It is a maxim of
      the civil law, that whosoever cannot pay with his purse, must pay
      with his body; and the practice of flagellation was adopted by
      the monks, a cheap, though painful equivalent. By a fantastic
      arithmetic, a year of penance was taxed at three thousand lashes;
      25 and such was the skill and patience of a famous hermit, St.
      Dominic of the iron Cuirass, 26 that in six days he could
      discharge an entire century, by a whipping of three hundred
      thousand stripes. His example was followed by many penitents of
      both sexes; and, as a vicarious sacrifice was accepted, a sturdy
      disciplinarian might expiate on his own back the sins of his
      benefactors. 27 These compensations of the purse and the person
      introduced, in the eleventh century, a more honorable mode of
      satisfaction. The merit of military service against the Saracens
      of Africa and Spain had been allowed by the predecessors of Urban
      the Second. In the council of Clermont, that pope proclaimed a
      plenary indulgence to those who should enlist under the banner of
      the cross; the absolution of all their sins, and a full receipt
      for all that might be due of canonical penance. 28 The cold
      philosophy of modern times is incapable of feeling the impression
      that was made on a sinful and fanatic world. At the voice of
      their pastor, the robber, the incendiary, the homicide, arose by
      thousands to redeem their souls, by repeating on the infidels the
      same deeds which they had exercised against their Christian
      brethren; and the terms of atonement were eagerly embraced by
      offenders of every rank and denomination. None were pure; none
      were exempt from the guilt and penalty of sin; and those who were
      the least amenable to the justice of God and the church were the
      best entitled to the temporal and eternal recompense of their
      pious courage. If they fell, the spirit of the Latin clergy did
      not hesitate to adorn their tomb with the crown of martyrdom; 29
      and should they survive, they could expect without impatience the
      delay and increase of their heavenly reward. They offered their
      blood to the Son of God, who had laid down his life for their
      salvation: they took up the cross, and entered with confidence
      into the way of the Lord. His providence would watch over their
      safety; perhaps his visible and miraculous power would smooth the
      difficulties of their holy enterprise. The cloud and pillar of
      Jehovah had marched before the Israelites into the promised land.
      Might not the Christians more reasonably hope that the rivers
      would open for their passage; that the walls of their strongest
      cities would fall at the sound of their trumpets; and that the
      sun would be arrested in his mid career, to allow them time for
      the destruction of the infidels?

      Chapter LVIII: The First Crusade.—Part II.

      Of the chiefs and soldiers who marched to the holy sepulchre, I
      will dare to affirm, that all were prompted by the spirit of
      enthusiasm; the belief of merit, the hope of reward, and the
      assurance of divine aid. But I am equally persuaded, that in many
      it was not the sole, that in some it was not the leading,
      principle of action. The use and abuse of religion are feeble to
      stem, they are strong and irresistible to impel, the stream of
      national manners. Against the private wars of the Barbarians,
      their bloody tournaments, licentious love, and judicial duels,
      the popes and synods might ineffectually thunder. It is a more
      easy task to provoke the metaphysical disputes of the Greeks, to
      drive into the cloister the victims of anarchy or despotism, to
      sanctify the patience of slaves and cowards, or to assume the
      merit of the humanity and benevolence of modern Christians. War
      and exercise were the reigning passions of the Franks or Latins;
      they were enjoined, as a penance, to gratify those passions, to
      visit distant lands, and to draw their swords against the nation
      of the East. Their victory, or even their attempt, would
      immortalize the names of the intrepid heroes of the cross; and
      the purest piety could not be insensible to the most splendid
      prospect of military glory. In the petty quarrels of Europe, they
      shed the blood of their friends and countrymen, for the
      acquisition perhaps of a castle or a village. They could march
      with alacrity against the distant and hostile nations who were
      devoted to their arms; their fancy already grasped the golden
      sceptres of Asia; and the conquest of Apulia and Sicily by the
      Normans might exalt to royalty the hopes of the most private
      adventurer. Christendom, in her rudest state, must have yielded
      to the climate and cultivation of the Mahometan countries; and
      their natural and artificial wealth had been magnified by the
      tales of pilgrims, and the gifts of an imperfect commerce. The
      vulgar, both the great and small, were taught to believe every
      wonder, of lands flowing with milk and honey, of mines and
      treasures, of gold and diamonds, of palaces of marble and jasper,
      and of odoriferous groves of cinnamon and frankincense. In this
      earthly paradise, each warrior depended on his sword to carve a
      plenteous and honorable establishment, which he measured only by
      the extent of his wishes. 30 Their vassals and soldiers trusted
      their fortunes to God and their master: the spoils of a Turkish
      emir might enrich the meanest follower of the camp; and the
      flavor of the wines, the beauty of the Grecian women, 31 were
      temptations more adapted to the nature, than to the profession,
      of the champions of the cross. The love of freedom was a powerful
      incitement to the multitudes who were oppressed by feudal or
      ecclesiastical tyranny. Under this holy sign, the peasants and
      burghers, who were attached to the servitude of the glebe, might
      escape from a haughty lord, and transplant themselves and their
      families to a land of liberty. The monk might release himself
      from the discipline of his convent: the debtor might suspend the
      accumulation of usury, and the pursuit of his creditors; and
      outlaws and malefactors of every cast might continue to brave the
      laws and elude the punishment of their crimes. 32

      30 (return) [ The same hopes were displayed in the letters of the
      adventurers ad animandos qui in Francia residerant. Hugh de
      Reiteste could boast, that his share amounted to one abbey and
      ten castles, of the yearly value of 1500 marks, and that he
      should acquire a hundred castles by the conquest of Aleppo,
      (Guibert, p. 554, 555.)]

      31 (return) [ In his genuine or fictitious letter to the count of
      Flanders, Alexius mingles with the danger of the church, and the
      relics of saints, the auri et argenti amor, and pulcherrimarum
      foeminarum voluptas, (p. 476;) as if, says the indignant Guibert,
      the Greek women were handsomer than those of France.]

      32 (return) [ See the privileges of the Crucesignati, freedom
      from debt, usury injury, secular justice, &c. The pope was their
      perpetual guardian (Ducange, tom. ii. p. 651, 652.)]

      These motives were potent and numerous: when we have singly
      computed their weight on the mind of each individual, we must add
      the infinite series, the multiplying powers, of example and
      fashion. The first proselytes became the warmest and most
      effectual missionaries of the cross: among their friends and
      countrymen they preached the duty, the merit, and the recompense,
      of their holy vow; and the most reluctant hearers were insensibly
      drawn within the whirlpool of persuasion and authority. The
      martial youths were fired by the reproach or suspicion of
      cowardice; the opportunity of visiting with an army the sepulchre
      of Christ was embraced by the old and infirm, by women and
      children, who consulted rather their zeal than their strength;
      and those who in the evening had derided the folly of their
      companions, were the most eager, the ensuing day, to tread in
      their footsteps. The ignorance, which magnified the hopes,
      diminished the perils, of the enterprise. Since the Turkish
      conquest, the paths of pilgrimage were obliterated; the chiefs
      themselves had an imperfect notion of the length of the way and
      the state of their enemies; and such was the stupidity of the
      people, that, at the sight of the first city or castle beyond the
      limits of their knowledge, they were ready to ask whether that
      was not the Jerusalem, the term and object of their labors. Yet
      the more prudent of the crusaders, who were not sure that they
      should be fed from heaven with a shower of quails or manna,
      provided themselves with those precious metals, which, in every
      country, are the representatives of every commodity. To defray,
      according to their rank, the expenses of the road, princes
      alienated their provinces, nobles their lands and castles,
      peasants their cattle and the instruments of husbandry. The value
      of property was depreciated by the eager competition of
      multitudes; while the price of arms and horses was raised to an
      exorbitant height by the wants and impatience of the buyers. 33
      Those who remained at home, with sense and money, were enriched
      by the epidemical disease: the sovereigns acquired at a cheap
      rate the domains of their vassals; and the ecclesiastical
      purchasers completed the payment by the assurance of their
      prayers. The cross, which was commonly sewed on the garment, in
      cloth or silk, was inscribed by some zealots on their skin: a hot
      iron, or indelible liquor, was applied to perpetuate the mark;
      and a crafty monk, who showed the miraculous impression on his
      breast was repaid with the popular veneration and the richest
      benefices of Palestine. 34

      33 (return) [ Guibert (p. 481) paints in lively colors this
      general emotion. He was one of the few contemporaries who had

      before their eyes. Erat itaque videre miraculum, caro omnes
      emere, atque vili vendere, &c.]

      34 (return) [ Some instances of these stigmata are given in the
      Esprit des Croisades, (tom. iii. p. 169 &c.,) from authors whom I
      have not seen]

      The fifteenth of August had been fixed in the council of Clermont
      for the departure of the pilgrims; but the day was anticipated by
      the thoughtless and needy crowd of plebeians, and I shall briefly
      despatch the calamities which they inflicted and suffered, before
      I enter on the more serious and successful enterprise of the
      chiefs. Early in the spring, from the confines of France and
      Lorraine, above sixty thousand of the populace of both sexes
      flocked round the first missionary of the crusade, and pressed
      him with clamorous importunity to lead them to the holy
      sepulchre. The hermit, assuming the character, without the
      talents or authority, of a general, impelled or obeyed the
      forward impulse of his votaries along the banks of the Rhine and
      Danube. Their wants and numbers soon compelled them to separate,
      and his lieutenant, Walter the Penniless, a valiant though needy
      soldier, conducted a van guard of pilgrims, whose condition may
      be determined from the proportion of eight horsemen to fifteen
      thousand foot. The example and footsteps of Peter were closely
      pursued by another fanatic, the monk Godescal, whose sermons had
      swept away fifteen or twenty thousand peasants from the villages
      of Germany. Their rear was again pressed by a herd of two hundred
      thousand, the most stupid and savage refuse of the people, who
      mingled with their devotion a brutal license of rapine,
      prostitution, and drunkenness. Some counts and gentlemen, at the
      head of three thousand horse, attended the motions of the
      multitude to partake in the spoil; but their genuine leaders (may
      we credit such folly?) were a goose and a goat, who were carried
      in the front, and to whom these worthy Christians ascribed an
      infusion of the divine spirit. 35 Of these, and of other bands of
      enthusiasts, the first and most easy warfare was against the
      Jews, the murderers of the Son of God. In the trading cities of
      the Moselle and the Rhine, their colonies were numerous and rich;
      and they enjoyed, under the protection of the emperor and the
      bishops, the free exercise of their religion. 36 At Verdun,
      Treves, Mentz, Spires, Worms, many thousands of that unhappy
      people were pillaged and massacred: 37 nor had they felt a more
      bloody stroke since the persecution of Hadrian. A remnant was
      saved by the firmness of their bishops, who accepted a feigned
      and transient conversion; but the more obstinate Jews opposed
      their fanaticism to the fanaticism of the Christians, barricadoed
      their houses, and precipitating themselves, their families, and
      their wealth, into the rivers or the flames, disappointed the
      malice, or at least the avarice, of their implacable foes.

      Manichee or Gnostic standards.” (The author says the animals
      themselves were carried before the army.—M.) “The goose, in
      Egyptian symbols, as every Egyptian scholar knows, meant ‘divine
      Son,’ or ‘Son of God.’ The goat meant Typhon, or Devil. Thus we
      have the Manichee opposing principles of good and evil, as
      standards, at the head of the ignorant mob of crusading invaders.

      been infected with the Manichee or Gnostic idolatry?” Account of

      opinions among the common people of Europe. At any rate, in so
      inexplicable a matter, we are inclined to catch at any
      explanation, however wild or subtile.—M.]

      Between the frontiers of Austria and the seat of the Byzantine
      monarchy, the crusaders were compelled to traverse as interval of
      six hundred miles; the wild and desolate countries of Hungary 38
      and Bulgaria. The soil is fruitful, and intersected with rivers;
      but it was then covered with morasses and forests, which spread
      to a boundless extent, whenever man has ceased to exercise his
      dominion over the earth. Both nations had imbibed the rudiments
      of Christianity; the Hungarians were ruled by their native
      princes; the Bulgarians by a lieutenant of the Greek emperor;
      but, on the slightest provocation, their ferocious nature was
      rekindled, and ample provocation was afforded by the disorders of

      timber, which were deserted in the summer season for the tents of
      hunters and shepherds. A scanty supply of provisions was rudely
      demanded, forcibly seized, and greedily consumed; and on the
      first quarrel, the crusaders gave a loose to indignation and
      revenge. But their ignorance of the country, of war, and of
      discipline, exposed them to every snare. The Greek praefect of
      Bulgaria commanded a regular force; 381 at the trumpet of the
      Hungarian king, the eighth or the tenth of his martial subjects
      bent their bows and mounted on horseback; their policy was
      insidious, and their retaliation on these pious robbers was
      unrelenting and bloody. 39 About a third of the naked fugitives
      (and the hermit Peter was of the number) escaped to the Thracian
      mountains; and the emperor, who respected the pilgrimage and
      succor of the Latins, conducted them by secure and easy journeys
      to Constantinople, and advised them to await the arrival of their
      brethren. For a while they remembered their faults and losses;
      but no sooner were they revived by the hospitable entertainment,
      than their venom was again inflamed; they stung their benefactor,
      and neither gardens, nor palaces, nor churches, were safe from
      their depredations. For his own safety, Alexius allured them to
      pass over to the Asiatic side of the Bosphorus; but their blind
      impetuosity soon urged them to desert the station which he had
      assigned, and to rush headlong against the Turks, who occupied
      the road to Jerusalem. The hermit, conscious of his shame, had
      withdrawn from the camp to Constantinople; and his lieutenant,
      Walter the Penniless, who was worthy of a better command,
      attempted without success to introduce some order and prudence
      among the herd of savages. They separated in quest of prey, and
      themselves fell an easy prey to the arts of the sultan. By a
      rumor that their foremost companions were rioting in the spoils
      of his capital, Soliman 391 tempted the main body to descend into
      the plain of Nice: they were overwhelmed by the Turkish arrows;
      and a pyramid of bones 40 informed their companions of the place
      of their defeat. Of the first crusaders, three hundred thousand
      had already perished, before a single city was rescued from the
      infidels, before their graver and more noble brethren had
      completed the preparations of their enterprise. 41

      “To save time and space, I shall represent, in a short table, the
      particular references to the great events of the first crusade.”

    [See Table 1.: Events Of The First Crusade]

      None of the great sovereigns of Europe embarked their persons in
      the first crusade. The emperor Henry the Fourth was not disposed
      to obey the summons of the pope: Philip the First of France was
      occupied by his pleasures; William Rufus of England by a recent
      conquest; the kin`gs of Spain were engaged in a domestic war
      against the Moors; and the northern monarchs of Scotland,
      Denmark, 42 Sweden, and Poland, were yet strangers to the
      passions and interests of the South. The religious ardor was more
      strongly felt by the princes of the second order, who held an
      important place in the feudal system. Their situation will
      naturally cast under four distinct heads the review of their
      names and characters; but I may escape some needless repetition,
      by observing at once, that courage and the exercise of arms are
      the common attribute of these Christian adventurers. I. The first
      rank both in war and council is justly due to Godfrey of
      Bouillon; and happy would it have been for the crusaders, if they
      had trusted themselves to the sole conduct of that accomplished
      hero, a worthy representative of Charlemagne, from whom he was
      descended in the female line. His father was of the noble race of
      the counts of Boulogne: Brabant, the lower province of Lorraine,
      43 was the inheritance of his mother; and by the emperor’s bounty
      he was himself invested with that ducal title, which has been
      improperly transferred to his lordship of Bouillon in the
      Ardennes. 44 In the service of Henry the Fourth, he bore the
      great standard of the empire, and pierced with his lance the
      breast of Rodolph, the rebel king: Godfrey was the first who
      ascended the walls of Rome; and his sickness, his vow, perhaps
      his remorse for bearing arms against the pope, confirmed an early
      resolution of visiting the holy sepulchre, not as a pilgrim, but
      a deliverer. His valor was matured by prudence and moderation;
      his piety, though blind, was sincere; and, in the tumult of a
      camp, he practised the real and fictitious virtues of a convent.
      Superior to the private factions of the chiefs, he reserved his
      enmity for the enemies of Christ; and though he gained a kingdom
      by the attempt, his pure and disinterested zeal was acknowledged
      by his rivals. Godfrey of Bouillon 45 was accompanied by his two
      brothers, by Eustace the elder, who had succeeded to the county
      of Boulogne, and by the younger, Baldwin, a character of more
      ambiguous virtue. The duke of Lorraine, was alike celebrated on
      either side of the Rhine: from his birth and education, he was
      equally conversant with the French and Teutonic languages: the
      barons of France, Germany, and Lorraine, assembled their vassals;
      and the confederate force that marched under his banner was
      composed of fourscore thousand foot and about ten thousand horse.
      II. In the parliament that was held at Paris, in the king’s
      presence, about two months after the council of Clermont, Hugh,
      count of Vermandois, was the most conspicuous of the princes who
      assumed the cross. But the appellation of the Great was applied,
      not so much to his merit or possessions, (though neither were
      contemptible,) as to the royal birth of the brother of the king
      of France. 46 Robert, duke of Normandy, was the eldest son of
      William the Conqueror; but on his father’s death he was deprived
      of the kingdom of England, by his own indolence and the activity
      of his brother Rufus. The worth of Robert was degraded by an
      excessive levity and easiness of temper: his cheerfulness seduced
      him to the indulgence of pleasure; his profuse liberality
      impoverished the prince and people; his indiscriminate clemency
      multiplied the number of offenders; and the amiable qualities of
      a private man became the essential defects of a sovereign. For
      the trifling sum of ten thousand marks, he mortgaged Normandy
      during his absence to the English usurper; 47 but his engagement
      and behavior in the holy war announced in Robert a reformation of
      manners, and restored him in some degree to the public esteem.
      Another Robert was count of Flanders, a royal province, which, in
      this century, gave three queens to the thrones of France,
      England, and Denmark: he was surnamed the Sword and Lance of the
      Christians; but in the exploits of a soldier he sometimes forgot
      the duties of a general. Stephen, count of Chartres, of Blois,
      and of Troyes, was one of the richest princes of the age; and the
      number of his castles has been compared to the three hundred and
      sixty-five days of the year. His mind was improved by literature;
      and, in the council of the chiefs, the eloquent Stephen 48 was
      chosen to discharge the office of their president. These four
      were the principal leaders of the French, the Normans, and the
      pilgrims of the British isles: but the list of the barons who
      were possessed of three or four towns would exceed, says a
      contemporary, the catalogue of the Trojan war. 49 III. In the
      south of France, the command was assumed by Adhemar bishop of
      Puy, the pope egate, and by Raymond count of St. Giles and
      Thoulouse who added the prouder titles of duke of Narbonne and
      marquis of Provence. The former was a respectable prelate, alike
      qualified for this world and the next. The latter was a veteran
      warrior, who had fought against the Saracens of Spain, and who
      consecrated his declining age, not only to the deliverance, but
      to the perpetual service, of the holy sepulchre. His experience
      and riches gave him a strong ascendant in the Christian camp,
      whose distress he was often able, and sometimes willing, to
      relieve. But it was easier for him to extort the praise of the
      Infidels, than to preserve the love of his subjects and
      associates. His eminent qualities were clouded by a temper
      haughty, envious, and obstinate; and, though he resigned an ample
      patrimony for the cause of God, his piety, in the public opinion,
      was not exempt from avarice and ambition. 50 A mercantile, rather
      than a martial, spirit prevailed among his provincials, 51 a
      common name, which included the natives of Auvergne and
      Languedoc, 52 the vassals of the kingdom of Burgundy or Arles.
      From the adjacent frontier of Spain he drew a band of hardy
      adventurers; as he marched through Lombardy, a crowd of Italians
      flocked to his standard, and his united force consisted of one
      hundred thousand horse and foot. If Raymond was the first to
      enlist and the last to depart, the delay may be excused by the
      greatness of his preparation and the promise of an everlasting
      farewell. IV. The name of Bohemond, the son of Robert Guiscard,
      was already famous by his double victory over the Greek emperor;
      but his father’s will had reduced him to the principality of
      Tarentum, and the remembrance of his Eastern trophies, till he
      was awakened by the rumor and passage of the French pilgrims. It
      is in the person of this Norman chief that we may seek for the
      coolest policy and ambition, with a small allay of religious
      fanaticism. His conduct may justify a belief that he had secretly
      directed the design of the pope, which he affected to second with
      astonishment and zeal: at the siege of Amalphi, his example and
      discourse inflamed the passions of a confederate army; he
      instantly tore his garment to supply crosses for the numerous
      candidates, and prepared to visit Constantinople and Asia at the
      head of ten thousand horse and twenty thousand foot. Several
      princes of the Norman race accompanied this veteran general; and
      his cousin Tancred 53 was the partner, rather than the servant,
      of the war.

      In the accomplished character of Tancred we discover all the
      virtues of a perfect knight, 54 the true spirit of chivalry,
      which inspired the generous sentiments and social offices of man
      far better than the base philosophy, or the baser religion, of
      the times.

      Chapter LVIII: The First Crusade.—Part III.

      Between the age of Charlemagne and that of the crusades, a
      revolution had taken place among the Spaniards, the Normans, and
      the French, which was gradually extended to the rest of Europe.
      The service of the infantry was degraded to the plebeians; the
      cavalry formed the strength of the armies, and the honorable name
      of miles, or soldier, was confined to the gentlemen 55 who served
      on horseback, and were invested with the character of knighthood.
      The dukes and counts, who had usurped the rights of sovereignty,
      divided the provinces among their faithful barons: the barons
      distributed among their vassals the fiefs or benefices of their
      jurisdiction; and these military tenants, the peers of each other
      and of their lord, composed the noble or equestrian order, which
      disdained to conceive the peasant or burgher as of the same
      species with themselves. The dignity of their birth was preserved
      by pure and equal alliances; their sons alone, who could produce
      four quarters or lines of ancestry without spot or reproach,
      might legally pretend to the honor of knighthood; but a valiant
      plebeian was sometimes enriched and ennobled by the sword, and
      became the father of a new race. A single knight could impart,
      according to his judgment, the character which he received; and
      the warlike sovereigns of Europe derived more glory from this
      personal distinction than from the lustre of their diadem. This
      ceremony, of which some traces may be found in Tacitus and the
      woods of Germany, 56 was in its origin simple and profane; the
      candidate, after some previous trial, was invested with the sword
      and spurs; and his cheek or shoulder was touched with a slight
      blow, as an emblem of the last affront which it was lawful for
      him to endure. But superstition mingled in every public and
      private action of life: in the holy wars, it sanctified the
      profession of arms; and the order of chivalry was assimilated in
      its rights and privileges to the sacred orders of priesthood. The
      bath and white garment of the novice were an indecent copy of the
      regeneration of baptism: his sword, which he offered on the
      altar, was blessed by the ministers of religion: his solemn
      reception was preceded by fasts and vigils; and he was created a
      knight in the name of God, of St. George, and of St. Michael the
      archangel. He swore to accomplish the duties of his profession;
      and education, example, and the public opinion, were the
      inviolable guardians of his oath. As the champion of God and the
      ladies, (I blush to unite such discordant names,) he devoted
      himself to speak the truth; to maintain the right; to protect the
      distressed; to practise courtesy, a virtue less familiar to the
      ancients; to pursue the infidels; to despise the allurements of
      ease and safety; and to vindicate in every perilous adventure the
      honor of his character. The abuse of the same spirit provoked the
      illiterate knight to disdain the arts of industry and peace; to
      esteem himself the sole judge and avenger of his own injuries;
      and proudly to neglect the laws of civil society and military
      discipline. Yet the benefits of this institution, to refine the
      temper of Barbarians, and to infuse some principles of faith,
      justice, and humanity, were strongly felt, and have been often
      observed. The asperity of national prejudice was softened; and
      the community of religion and arms spread a similar color and
      generous emulation over the face of Christendom. Abroad in
      enterprise and pilgrimage, at home in martial exercise, the
      warriors of every country were perpetually associated; and
      impartial taste must prefer a Gothic tournament to the Olympic
      games of classic antiquity. 57 Instead of the naked spectacles
      which corrupted the manners of the Greeks, and banished from the
      stadium the virgins and matrons, the pompous decoration of the
      lists was crowned with the presence of chaste and high-born
      beauty, from whose hands the conqueror received the prize of his
      dexterity and courage. The skill and strength that were exerted
      in wrestling and boxing bear a distant and doubtful relation to
      the merit of a soldier; but the tournaments, as they were
      invented in France, and eagerly adopted both in the East and
      West, presented a lively image of the business of the field. The
      single combats, the general skirmish, the defence of a pass, or
      castle, were rehearsed as in actual service; and the contest,
      both in real and mimic war, was decided by the superior
      management of the horse and lance. The lance was the proper and
      peculiar weapon of the knight: his horse was of a large and heavy
      breed; but this charger, till he was roused by the approaching
      danger, was usually led by an attendant, and he quietly rode a
      pad or palfrey of a more easy pace. His helmet and sword, his
      greaves and buckler, it would be superfluous to describe; but I
      may remark, that, at the period of the crusades, the armor was
      less ponderous than in later times; and that, instead of a massy
      cuirass, his breast was defended by a hauberk or coat of mail.
      When their long lances were fixed in the rest, the warriors
      furiously spurred their horses against the foe; and the light
      cavalry of the Turks and Arabs could seldom stand against the
      direct and impetuous weight of their charge. Each knight was
      attended to the field by his faithful squire, a youth of equal
      birth and similar hopes; he was followed by his archers and men
      at arms, and four, or five, or six soldiers were computed as the
      furniture of a complete lance. In the expeditions to the
      neighboring kingdoms or the Holy Land, the duties of the feudal
      tenure no longer subsisted; the voluntary service of the knights
      and their followers were either prompted by zeal or attachment,
      or purchased with rewards and promises; and the numbers of each
      squadron were measured by the power, the wealth, and the fame, of
      each independent chieftain. They were distinguished by his
      banner, his armorial coat, and his cry of war; and the most
      ancient families of Europe must seek in these achievements the
      origin and proof of their nobility. In this rapid portrait of
      chivalry I have been urged to anticipate on the story of the
      crusades, at once an effect and a cause, of this memorable
      institution. 58

      Such were the troops, and such the leaders, who assumed the cross
      for the deliverance of the holy sepulchre. As soon as they were
      relieved by the absence of the plebeian multitude, they
      encouraged each other, by interviews and messages, to accomplish
      their vow, and hasten their departure. Their wives and sisters
      were desirous of partaking the danger and merit of the
      pilgrimage: their portable treasures were conveyed in bars of
      silver and gold; and the princes and barons were attended by
      their equipage of hounds and hawks to amuse their leisure and to
      supply their table. The difficulty of procuring subsistence for
      so many myriads of men and horses engaged them to separate their
      forces: their choice or situation determined the road; and it was
      agreed to meet in the neighborhood of Constantinople, and from
      thence to begin their operations against the Turks. From the
      banks of the Meuse and the Moselle, Godfrey of Bouillon followed
      the direct way of Germany, Hungary, and Bulgaria; and, as long as
      he exercised the sole command every step afforded some proof of
      his prudence and virtue. On the confines of Hungary he was
      stopped three weeks by a Christian people, to whom the name, or
      at least the abuse, of the cross was justly odious. The
      Hungarians still smarted with the wounds which they had received
      from the first pilgrims: in their turn they had abused the right
      of defence and retaliation; and they had reason to apprehend a
      severe revenge from a hero of the same nation, and who was
      engaged in the same cause. But, after weighing the motives and
      the events, the virtuous duke was content to pity the crimes and
      misfortunes of his worthless brethren; and his twelve deputies,
      the messengers of peace, requested in his name a free passage and
      an equal market. To remove their suspicions, Godfrey trusted
      himself, and afterwards his brother, to the faith of Carloman,
      581 king of Hungary, who treated them with a simple but
      hospitable entertainment: the treaty was sanctified by their
      common gospel; and a proclamation, under pain of death,
      restrained the animosity and license of the Latin soldiers. From
      Austria to Belgrade, they traversed the plains of Hungary,
      without enduring or offering an injury; and the proximity of
      Carloman, who hovered on their flanks with his numerous cavalry,
      was a precaution not less useful for their safety than for his
      own. They reached the banks of the Save; and no sooner had they
      passed the river, than the king of Hungary restored the hostages,
      and saluted their departure with the fairest wishes for the
      success of their enterprise. With the same conduct and
      discipline, Godfrey pervaded the woods of Bulgaria and the
      frontiers of Thrace; and might congratulate himself that he had
      almost reached the first term of his pilgrimage, without drawing
      his sword against a Christian adversary. After an easy and
      pleasant journey through Lombardy, from Turin to Aquileia,
      Raymond and his provincials marched forty days through the savage
      country of Dalmatia 59 and Sclavonia. The weather was a perpetual
      fog; the land was mountainous and desolate; the natives were
      either fugitive or hostile: loose in their religion and
      government, they refused to furnish provisions or guides;
      murdered the stragglers; and exercised by night and day the
      vigilance of the count, who derived more security from the
      punishment of some captive robbers than from his interview and
      treaty with the prince of Scodra. 60 His march between Durazzo
      and Constantinople was harassed, without being stopped, by the
      peasants and soldiers of the Greek emperor; and the same faint
      and ambiguous hostility was prepared for the remaining chiefs,
      who passed the Adriatic from the coast of Italy. Bohemond had
      arms and vessels, and foresight and discipline; and his name was
      not forgotten in the provinces of Epirus and Thessaly. Whatever
      obstacles he encountered were surmounted by his military conduct
      and the valor of Tancred; and if the Norman prince affected to
      spare the Greeks, he gorged his soldiers with the full plunder of
      an heretical castle. 61 The nobles of France pressed forwards
      with the vain and thoughtless ardor of which their nation has
      been sometimes accused. From the Alps to Apulia the march of Hugh
      the Great, of the two Roberts, and of Stephen of Chartres,
      through a wealthy country, and amidst the applauding Catholics,
      was a devout or triumphant progress: they kissed the feet of the
      Roman pontiff; and the golden standard of St. Peter was delivered
      to the brother of the French monarch. 62 But in this visit of
      piety and pleasure, they neglected to secure the season, and the
      means of their embarkation: the winter was insensibly lost: their
      troops were scattered and corrupted in the towns of Italy. They
      separately accomplished their passage, regardless of safety or
      dignity; and within nine months from the feast of the Assumption,
      the day appointed by Urban, all the Latin princes had reached
      Constantinople. But the count of Vermandois was produced as a
      captive; his foremost vessels were scattered by a tempest; and
      his person, against the law of nations, was detained by the
      lieutenants of Alexius. Yet the arrival of Hugh had been
      announced by four-and-twenty knights in golden armor, who
      commanded the emperor to revere the general of the Latin
      Christians, the brother of the king of kings. 63 631

      In some oriental tale I have read the fable of a shepherd, who
      was ruined by the accomplishment of his own wishes: he had prayed
      for water; the Ganges was turned into his grounds, and his flock
      and cottage were swept away by the inundation. Such was the
      fortune, or at least the apprehension of the Greek emperor
      Alexius Comnenus, whose name has already appeared in this
      history, and whose conduct is so differently represented by his
      daughter Anne, 64 and by the Latin writers. 65 In the council of
      Placentia, his ambassadors had solicited a moderate succor,
      perhaps of ten thousand soldiers, but he was astonished by the
      approach of so many potent chiefs and fanatic nations. The
      emperor fluctuated between hope and fear, between timidity and
      courage; but in the crooked policy which he mistook for wisdom, I
      cannot believe, I cannot discern, that he maliciously conspired
      against the life or honor of the French heroes. The promiscuous
      multitudes of Peter the Hermit were savage beasts, alike
      destitute of humanity and reason: nor was it possible for Alexius
      to prevent or deplore their destruction. The troops of Godfrey
      and his peers were less contemptible, but not less suspicious, to
      the Greek emperor. Their motives might be pure and pious: but he
      was equally alarmed by his knowledge of the ambitious Bohemond,
      651 and his ignorance of the Transalpine chiefs: the courage of
      the French was blind and headstrong; they might be tempted by the
      luxury and wealth of Greece, and elated by the view and opinion
      of their invincible strength: and Jerusalem might be forgotten in
      the prospect of Constantinople. After a long march and painful
      abstinence, the troops of Godfrey encamped in the plains of
      Thrace; they heard with indignation, that their brother, the
      count of Vermandois, was imprisoned by the Greeks; and their
      reluctant duke was compelled to indulge them in some freedom of
      retaliation and rapine. They were appeased by the submission of
      Alexius: he promised to supply their camp; and as they refused,
      in the midst of winter, to pass the Bosphorus, their quarters
      were assigned among the gardens and palaces on the shores of that
      narrow sea. But an incurable jealousy still rankled in the minds
      of the two nations, who despised each other as slaves and
      Barbarians. Ignorance is the ground of suspicion, and suspicion
      was inflamed into daily provocations: prejudice is blind, hunger
      is deaf; and Alexius is accused of a design to starve or assault
      the Latins in a dangerous post, on all sides encompassed with the
      waters. 66 Godfrey sounded his trumpets, burst the net,
      overspread the plain, and insulted the suburbs; but the gates of
      Constantinople were strongly fortified; the ramparts were lined
      with archers; and, after a doubtful conflict, both parties
      listened to the voice of peace and religion. The gifts and
      promises of the emperor insensibly soothed the fierce spirit of
      the western strangers; as a Christian warrior, he rekindled their
      zeal for the prosecution of their holy enterprise, which he
      engaged to second with his troops and treasures. On the return of
      spring, Godfrey was persuaded to occupy a pleasant and plentiful
      camp in Asia; and no sooner had he passed the Bosphorus, than the
      Greek vessels were suddenly recalled to the opposite shore. The
      same policy was repeated with the succeeding chiefs, who were
      swayed by the example, and weakened by the departure, of their
      foremost companions. By his skill and diligence, Alexius
      prevented the union of any two of the confederate armies at the
      same moment under the walls of Constantinople; and before the
      feast of the Pentecost not a Latin pilgrim was left on the coast
      of Europe.

      The same arms which threatened Europe might deliver Asia, and
      repel the Turks from the neighboring shores of the Bosphorus and
      Hellespont. The fair provinces from Nice to Antioch were the
      recent patrimony of the Roman emperor; and his ancient and
      perpetual claim still embraced the kingdoms of Syria and Egypt.
      In his enthusiasm, Alexius indulged, or affected, the ambitious
      hope of leading his new allies to subvert the thrones of the
      East; but the calmer dictates of reason and temper dissuaded him
      from exposing his royal person to the faith of unknown and
      lawless Barbarians. His prudence, or his pride, was content with
      extorting from the French princes an oath of homage and fidelity,
      and a solemn promise, that they

      would either restore, or hold, their Asiatic conquests as the
      humble and loyal vassals of the Roman empire. Their independent
      spirit was fired at the mention of this foreign and voluntary
      servitude: they successively yielded to the dexterous application
      of gifts and flattery; and the first proselytes became the most
      eloquent and effectual missionaries to multiply the companions of
      their shame. The pride of Hugh of Vermandois was soothed by the
      honors of his captivity; and in the brother of the French king,
      the example of submission was prevalent and weighty. In the mind
      of Godfrey of Bouillon every human consideration was subordinate
      to the glory of God and the success of the crusade. He had firmly
      resisted the temptations of Bohemond and Raymond, who urged the
      attack and conquest of Constantinople. Alexius esteemed his
      virtues, deservedly named him the champion of the empire, and
      dignified his homage with the filial name and the rights of
      adoption. 67 The hateful Bohemond was received as a true and
      ancient ally; and if the emperor reminded him of former
      hostilities, it was only to praise the valor that he had
      displayed, and the glory that he had acquired, in the fields of
      Durazzo and Larissa. The son of Guiscard was lodged and
      entertained, and served with Imperial pomp: one day, as he passed
      through the gallery of the palace, a door was carelessly left
      open to expose a pile of gold and silver, of silk and gems, of
      curious and costly furniture, that was heaped, in seeming
      disorder, from the floor to the roof of the chamber. “What
      conquests,” exclaimed the ambitious miser, “might not be achieved
      by the possession of such a treasure!”—“It is your own,” replied
      a Greek attendant, who watched the motions of his soul; and
      Bohemond, after some hesitation, condescended to accept this
      magnificent present. The Norman was flattered by the assurance of
      an independent principality; and Alexius eluded, rather than
      denied, his daring demand of the office of great domestic, or
      general of the East. The two Roberts, the son of the conqueror of
      England, and the kinsmen of three queens, 68 bowed in their turn
      before the Byzantine throne. A private letter of Stephen of
      Chartres attests his admiration of the emperor, the most
      excellent and liberal of men, who taught him to believe that he
      was a favorite, and promised to educate and establish his
      youngest son. In his southern province, the count of St. Giles
      and Thoulouse faintly recognized the supremacy of the king of
      France, a prince of a foreign nation and language. At the head of
      a hundred thousand men, he declared that he was the soldier and
      servant of Christ alone, and that the Greek might be satisfied
      with an equal treaty of alliance and friendship. His obstinate
      resistance enhanced the value and the price of his submission;
      and he shone, says the princess Anne, among the Barbarians, as
      the sun amidst the stars of heaven. His disgust of the noise and
      insolence of the French, his suspicions of the designs of
      Bohemond, the emperor imparted to his faithful Raymond; and that
      aged statesman might clearly discern, that however false in
      friendship, he was sincere in his enmity. 69 The spirit of
      chivalry was last subdued in the person of Tancred; and none
      could deem themselves dishonored by the imitation of that gallant
      knight. He disdained the gold and flattery of the Greek monarch;
      assaulted in his presence an insolent patrician; escaped to Asia
      in the habit of a private soldier; and yielded with a sigh to the
      authority of Bohemond, and the interest of the Christian cause.
      The best and most ostensible reason was the impossibility of
      passing the sea and accomplishing their vow, without the license
      and the vessels of Alexius; but they cherished a secret hope,
      that as soon as they trod the continent of Asia, their swords
      would obliterate their shame, and dissolve the engagement, which
      on his side might not be very faithfully performed. The ceremony
      of their homage was grateful to a people who had long since
      considered pride as the substitute of power. High on his throne,
      the emperor sat mute and immovable: his majesty was adored by the
      Latin princes; and they submitted to kiss either his feet or his
      knees, an indignity which their own writers are ashamed to
      confess and unable to deny. 70

      only singular, that Anna should not have amply supplied the
      silence or ambiguity of the Latins. The abasement of their
      princes would have added a fine chapter to the Ceremoniale Aulae

      Private or public interest suppressed the murmurs of the dukes
      and counts; but a French baron (he is supposed to be Robert of
      Paris 71 presumed to ascend the throne, and to place himself by
      the side of Alexius. The sage reproof of Baldwin provoked him to
      exclaim, in his barbarous idiom, “Who is this rustic, that keeps
      his seat, while so many valiant captains are standing round him?”
      The emperor maintained his silence, dissembled his indignation,
      and questioned his interpreter concerning the meaning of the
      words, which he partly suspected from the universal language of
      gesture and countenance. Before the departure of the pilgrims, he
      endeavored to learn the name and condition of the audacious
      baron. “I am a Frenchman,” replied Robert, “of the purest and
      most ancient nobility of my country. All that I know is, that
      there is a church in my neighborhood, 72 the resort of those who
      are desirous of approving their valor in single combat. Till an
      enemy appears, they address their prayers to God and his saints.
      That church I have frequently visited. But never have I found an
      antagonist who dared to accept my defiance.” Alexius dismissed
      the challenger with some prudent advice for his conduct in the
      Turkish warfare; and history repeats with pleasure this lively
      example of the manners of his age and country.

      The conquest of Asia was undertaken and achieved by Alexander,
      with thirty-five thousand Macedonians and Greeks; 73 and his best
      hope was in the strength and discipline of his phalanx of
      infantry. The principal force of the crusaders consisted in their
      cavalry; and when that force was mustered in the plains of
      Bithynia, the knights and their martial attendants on horseback
      amounted to one hundred thousand fighting men, completely armed
      with the helmet and coat of mail. The value of these soldiers
      deserved a strict and authentic account; and the flower of
      European chivalry might furnish, in a first effort, this
      formidable body of heavy horse. A part of the infantry might be
      enrolled for the service of scouts, pioneers, and archers; but
      the promiscuous crowd were lost in their own disorder; and we
      depend not on the eyes and knowledge, but on the belief and
      fancy, of a chaplain of Count Baldwin, 74 in the estimate of six
      hundred thousand pilgrims able to bear arms, besides the priests
      and monks, the women and children of the Latin camp. The reader
      starts; and before he is recovered from his surprise, I shall
      add, on the same testimony, that if all who took the cross had
      accomplished their vow, above six millions would have migrated
      from Europe to Asia. Under this oppression of faith, I derive
      some relief from a more sagacious and thinking writer, 75 who,
      after the same review of the cavalry, accuses the credulity of
      the priest of Chartres, and even doubts whether the Cisalpine
      regions (in the geography of a Frenchman) were sufficient to
      produce and pour forth such incredible multitudes. The coolest
      scepticism will remember, that of these religious volunteers
      great numbers never beheld Constantinople and Nice. Of enthusiasm
      the influence is irregular and transient: many were detained at
      home by reason or cowardice, by poverty or weakness; and many
      were repulsed by the obstacles of the way, the more insuperable
      as they were unforeseen, to these ignorant fanatics. The savage
      countries of Hungary and Bulgaria were whitened with their bones:
      their vanguard was cut in pieces by the Turkish sultan; and the
      loss of the first adventure, by the sword, or climate, or
      fatigue, has already been stated at three hundred thousand men.
      Yet the myriads that survived, that marched, that pressed
      forwards on the holy pilgrimage, were a subject of astonishment
      to themselves and to the Greeks. The copious energy of her
      language sinks under the efforts of the princess Anne: 76 the
      images of locusts, of leaves and flowers, of the sands of the
      sea, or the stars of heaven, imperfectly represent what she had
      seen and heard; and the daughter of Alexius exclaims, that Europe
      was loosened from its foundations, and hurled against Asia. The
      ancient hosts of Darius and Xerxes labor under the same doubt of
      a vague and indefinite magnitude; but I am inclined to believe,
      that a larger number has never been contained within the lines of
      a single camp, than at the siege of Nice, the first operation of
      the Latin princes. Their motives, their characters, and their
      arms, have been already displayed. Of their troops the most
      numerous portion were natives of France: the Low Countries, the
      banks of the Rhine, and Apulia, sent a powerful reenforcement:
      some bands of adventurers were drawn from Spain, Lombardy, and
      England; 77 and from the distant bogs and mountains of Ireland or
      Scotland 78 issued some naked and savage fanatics, ferocious at
      home but unwarlike abroad. Had not superstition condemned the
      sacrilegious prudence of depriving the poorest or weakest
      Christian of the merit of the pilgrimage, the useless crowd, with
      mouths but without hands, might have been stationed in the Greek
      empire, till their companions had opened and secured the way of
      the Lord. A small remnant of the pilgrims, who passed the
      Bosphorus, was permitted to visit the holy sepulchre. Their
      northern constitution was scorched by the rays, and infected by
      the vapors, of a Syrian sun. They consumed, with heedless
      prodigality, their stores of water and provision: their numbers
      exhausted the inland country: the sea was remote, the Greeks were
      unfriendly, and the Christians of every sect fled before the
      voracious and cruel rapine of their brethren. In the dire
      necessity of famine, they sometimes roasted and devoured the
      flesh of their infant or adult captives. Among the Turks and
      Saracens, the idolaters of Europe were rendered more odious by
      the name and reputation of Cannibals; the spies, who introduced
      themselves into the kitchen of Bohemond, were shown several human
      bodies turning on the spit: and the artful Norman encouraged a
      report, which increased at the same time the abhorrence and the
      terror of the infidels. 79

      73 (return) [ There is some diversity on the numbers of his army;
      but no authority can be compared with that of Ptolemy, who states

      74 (return) [ Fulcher. Carnotensis, p. 387. He enumerates

      the tenue murmur which had passed the British ocean, (p. 143,) he
      had confined himself to the numbers, families, and adventures of
      his countrymen. I find in Dugdale, that an English Norman,

      Chapter LVIII: The First Crusade.—Part IV.

      I have expiated with pleasure on the first steps of the
      crusaders, as they paint the manners and character of Europe: but
      I shall abridge the tedious and uniform narrative of their blind
      achievements, which were performed by strength and are described
      by ignorance. From their first station in the neighborhood of
      Nicomedia, they advanced in successive divisions; passed the
      contracted limit of the Greek empire; opened a road through the
      hills, and commenced, by the siege of his capital, their pious
      warfare against the Turkish sultan. His kingdom of Roum extended
      from the Hellespont to the confines of Syria, and barred the
      pilgrimage of Jerusalem, his name was Kilidge-Arslan, or Soliman,
      80 of the race of Seljuk, and son of the first conqueror; and in
      the defence of a land which the Turks considered as their own, he
      deserved the praise of his enemies, by whom alone he is known to
      posterity. Yielding to the first impulse of the torrent, he
      deposited his family and treasure in Nice; retired to the
      mountains with fifty thousand horse; and twice descended to
      assault the camps or quarters of the Christian besiegers, which
      formed an imperfect circle of above six miles. The lofty and
      solid walls of Nice were covered by a deep ditch, and flanked by
      three hundred and seventy towers; and on the verge of
      Christendom, the Moslems were trained in arms, and inflamed by
      religion. Before this city, the French princes occupied their
      stations, and prosecuted their attacks without correspondence or
      subordination: emulation prompted their valor; but their valor
      was sullied by cruelty, and their emulation degenerated into envy
      and civil discord. In the siege of Nice, the arts and engines of
      antiquity were employed by the Latins; the mine and the
      battering-ram, the tortoise, and the belfrey or movable turret,
      artificial fire, and the catapult and balist, the sling, and the
      crossbow for the casting of stones and darts. 81 In the space of
      seven weeks much labor and blood were expended, and some
      progress, especially by Count Raymond, was made on the side of
      the besiegers. But the Turks could protract their resistance and
      secure their escape, as long as they were masters of the Lake 82
      Ascanius, which stretches several miles to the westward of the
      city. The means of conquest were supplied by the prudence and
      industry of Alexius; a great number of boats was transported on
      sledges from the sea to the lake; they were filled with the most
      dexterous of his archers; the flight of the sultana was
      intercepted; Nice was invested by land and water; and a Greek
      emissary persuaded the inhabitants to accept his master’s
      protection, and to save themselves, by a timely surrender, from
      the rage of the savages of Europe. In the moment of victory, or
      at least of hope, the crusaders, thirsting for blood and plunder,
      were awed by the Imperial banner that streamed from the citadel;
      821 and Alexius guarded with jealous vigilance this important
      conquest. The murmurs of the chiefs were stifled by honor or
      interest; and after a halt of nine days, they directed their
      march towards Phrygia under the guidance of a Greek general, whom
      they suspected of a secret connivance with the sultan. The
      consort and the principal servants of Soliman had been honorably
      restored without ransom; and the emperor’s generosity to the
      miscreants 83 was interpreted as treason to the Christian cause.

      80 (return) [ His Mussulman appellation of Soliman is used by the
      Latins, and his character is highly embellished by Tasso. His
      Turkish name of Kilidge-Arslan (A. H. 485-500, A.D. 1192-1206.
      See De Guignes’s Tables, tom. i. p. 245) is employed by the
      Orientals, and with some corruption by the Greeks; but little
      more than his name can be found in the Mahometan writers, who are
      dry and sulky on the subject of the first crusade, (De Guignes,
      tom. iii. p. ii. p. 10-30.) * Note: See note, page 556. Soliman

      belfrey, was the movable tower of the ancients, (Ducange, tom. i.

      83 (return) [ Mecreant, a word invented by the French crusaders,
      and confined in that language to its primitive sense. It should
      seem, that the zeal of our ancestors boiled higher, and that they
      branded every unbeliever as a rascal. A similar prejudice still
      lurks in the minds of many who think themselves Christians.]

      Soliman was rather provoked than dismayed by the loss of his
      capital: he admonished his subjects and allies of this strange
      invasion of the Western Barbarians; the Turkish emirs obeyed the
      call of loyalty or religion; the Turkman hordes encamped round
      his standard; and his whole force is loosely stated by the
      Christians at two hundred, or even three hundred and sixty
      thousand horse. Yet he patiently waited till they had left behind
      them the sea and the Greek frontier; and hovering on the flanks,
      observed their careless and confident progress in two columns
      beyond the view of each other. Some miles before they could reach
      Dorylaeum in Phrygia, the left, and least numerous, division was
      surprised, and attacked, and almost oppressed, by the Turkish
      cavalry. 84 The heat of the weather, the clouds of arrows, and
      the barbarous onset, overwhelmed the crusaders; they lost their
      order and confidence, and the fainting fight was sustained by the
      personal valor, rather than by the military conduct, of Bohemond,
      Tancred, and Robert of Normandy. They were revived by the welcome
      banners of Duke Godfrey, who flew to their succor, with the count
      of Vermandois, and sixty thousand horse; and was followed by
      Raymond of Tholouse, the bishop of Puy, and the remainder of the
      sacred army. Without a moment’s pause, they formed in new order,
      and advanced to a second battle. They were received with equal
      resolution; and, in their common disdain for the unwarlike people
      of Greece and Asia, it was confessed on both sides, that the
      Turks and the Franks were the only nations entitled to the
      appellation of soldiers. 85 Their encounter was varied, and
      balanced by the contrast of arms and discipline; of the direct
      charge, and wheeling evolutions; of the couched lance, and the
      brandished javelin; of a weighty broadsword, and a crooked sabre;
      of cumbrous armor, and thin flowing robes; and of the long Tartar
      bow, and the arbalist or crossbow, a deadly weapon, yet unknown
      to the Orientals. 86 As long as the horses were fresh, and the
      quivers full, Soliman maintained the advantage of the day; and
      four thousand Christians were pierced by the Turkish arrows. In
      the evening, swiftness yielded to strength: on either side, the
      numbers were equal or at least as great as any ground could hold,
      or any generals could manage; but in turning the hills, the last
      division of Raymond and his provincials was led, perhaps without
      design on the rear of an exhausted enemy; and the long contest
      was determined. Besides a nameless and unaccounted multitude,
      three thousand Pagan knights were slain in the battle and
      pursuit; the camp of Soliman was pillaged; and in the variety of
      precious spoil, the curiosity of the Latins was amused with
      foreign arms and apparel, and the new aspect of dromedaries and
      camels. The importance of the victory was proved by the hasty
      retreat of the sultan: reserving ten thousand guards of the
      relics of his army, Soliman evacuated the kingdom of Roum, and
      hastened to implore the aid, and kindle the resentment, of his
      Eastern brethren. In a march of five hundred miles, the crusaders
      traversed the Lesser Asia, through a wasted land and deserted
      towns, without finding either a friend or an enemy. The
      geographer 87 may trace the position of Dorylaeum, Antioch of
      Pisidia, Iconium, Archelais, and Germanicia, and may compare
      those classic appellations with the modern names of Eskishehr the
      old city, Akshehr the white city, Cogni, Erekli, and Marash. As
      the pilgrims passed over a desert, where a draught of water is
      exchanged for silver, they were tormented by intolerable thirst;
      and on the banks of the first rivulet, their haste and
      intemperance were still more pernicious to the disorderly throng.
      They climbed with toil and danger the steep and slippery sides of
      Mount Taurus; many of the soldiers cast away their arms to secure
      their footsteps; and had not terror preceded their van, the long
      and trembling file might have been driven down the precipice by a
      handful of resolute enemies. Two of their most respectable
      chiefs, the duke of Lorraine and the count of Tholouse, were
      carried in litters: Raymond was raised, as it is said by miracle,
      from a hopeless malady; and Godfrey had been torn by a bear, as
      he pursued that rough and perilous chase in the mountains of
      Pisidia.

      84 (return) [ Baronius has produced a very doubtful letter to his
      brother Roger, (A.D. 1098, No. 15.) The enemies consisted of
      Medes, Persians, Chaldeans: be it so. The first attack was cum
      nostro incommodo; true and tender. But why Godfrey of Bouillon
      and Hugh brothers! Tancred is styled filius; of whom? Certainly
      not of Roger, nor of Bohemond.]

      et quia nullus homo naturaliter debet esse miles nisi Franci et

      valor is attested by Archbishop Baldric, (p. 99.)]

      under the name of izangra, was unknown in the East, (l. x. p.

      in Christian wars.]

      87 (return) [ The curious reader may compare the classic learning
      of Cellarius and the geographical science of D’Anville. William
      of Tyre is the only historian of the crusades who has any
      knowledge of antiquity; and M. Otter trod almost in the footsteps
      of the Franks from Constantinople to Antioch, (Voyage en Turquie
      et en Perse, tom. i. p. 35-88.) * Note: The journey of Col.
      Macdonald Kinneir in Asia Minor throws considerable light on the
      geography of this march of the crusaders.—M.]

      To improve the general consternation, the cousin of Bohemond and
      the brother of Godfrey were detached from the main army with
      their respective squadrons of five, and of seven, hundred
      knights. They overran in a rapid career the hills and sea-coast
      of Cilicia, from Cogni to the Syrian gates: the Norman standard
      was first planted on the walls of Tarsus and Malmistra; but the
      proud injustice of Baldwin at length provoked the patient and
      generous Italian; and they turned their consecrated swords
      against each other in a private and profane quarrel. Honor was
      the motive, and fame the reward, of Tancred; but fortune smiled
      on the more selfish enterprise of his rival. 88 He was called to
      the assistance of a Greek or Armenian tyrant, who had been
      suffered under the Turkish yoke to reign over the Christians of
      Edessa. Baldwin accepted the character of his son and champion:
      but no sooner was he introduced into the city, than he inflamed
      the people to the massacre of his father, occupied the throne and
      treasure, extended his conquests over the hills of Armenia and
      the plain of Mesopotamia, and founded the first principality of
      the Franks or Latins, which subsisted fifty-four years beyond the
      Euphrates. 89

      88 (return) [ This detached conquest of Edessa is best
      represented by Fulcherius Carnotensis, or of Chartres, (in the
      collections of Bongarsius Duchesne, and Martenne,) the valiant
      chaplain of Count Baldwin (Esprit des Croisades, tom. i. p. 13,
      14.) In the disputes of that prince with Tancred, his partiality
      is encountered by the partiality of Radulphus Cadomensis, the
      soldier and historian of the gallant marquis.]

      89 (return) [ See de Guignes, Hist. des Huns, tom. i. p. 456.]

      Before the Franks could enter Syria, the summer, and even the
      autumn, were completely wasted: the siege of Antioch, or the
      separation and repose of the army during the winter season, was
      strongly debated in their council: the love of arms and the holy
      sepulchre urged them to advance; and reason perhaps was on the
      side of resolution, since every hour of delay abates the fame and
      force of the invader, and multiplies the resources of defensive
      war. The capital of Syria was protected by the River Orontes; and
      the iron bridge, 891 of nine arches, derives its name from the
      massy gates of the two towers which are constructed at either
      end. They were opened by the sword of the duke of Normandy: his
      victory gave entrance to three hundred thousand crusaders, an
      account which may allow some scope for losses and desertion, but
      which clearly detects much exaggeration in the review of Nice. In
      the description of Antioch, 90 it is not easy to define a middle
      term between her ancient magnificence, under the successors of
      Alexander and Augustus, and the modern aspect of Turkish
      desolation. The Tetrapolis, or four cities, if they retained
      their name and position, must have left a large vacuity in a
      circumference of twelve miles; and that measure, as well as the
      number of four hundred towers, are not perfectly consistent with
      the five gates, so often mentioned in the history of the siege.
      Yet Antioch must have still flourished as a great and populous
      capital. At the head of the Turkish emirs, Baghisian, a veteran
      chief, commanded in the place: his garrison was composed of six
      or seven thousand horse, and fifteen or twenty thousand foot: one
      hundred thousand Moslems are said to have fallen by the sword;
      and their numbers were probably inferior to the Greeks,
      Armenians, and Syrians, who had been no more than fourteen years
      the slaves of the house of Seljuk. From the remains of a solid
      and stately wall, it appears to have arisen to the height of
      threescore feet in the valleys; and wherever less art and labor
      had been applied, the ground was supposed to be defended by the
      river, the morass, and the mountains. Notwithstanding these
      fortifications, the city had been repeatedly taken by the
      Persians, the Arabs, the Greeks, and the Turks; so large a
      circuit must have yielded many pervious points of attack; and in
      a siege that was formed about the middle of October, the vigor of
      the execution could alone justify the boldness of the attempt.
      Whatever strength and valor could perform in the field was
      abundantly discharged by the champions of the cross: in the
      frequent occasions of sallies, of forage, of the attack and
      defence of convoys, they were often victorious; and we can only
      complain, that their exploits are sometimes enlarged beyond the
      scale of probability and truth. The sword of Godfrey 91 divided a
      Turk from the shoulder to the haunch; and one half of the infidel
      fell to the ground, while the other was transported by his horse
      to the city gate. As Robert of Normandy rode against his
      antagonist, “I devote thy head,” he piously exclaimed, “to the
      daemons of hell;” and that head was instantly cloven to the
      breast by the resistless stroke of his descending falchion. But
      the reality or the report of such gigantic prowess 92 must have
      taught the Moslems to keep within their walls: and against those
      walls of earth or stone, the sword and the lance were unavailing
      weapons. In the slow and successive labors of a siege, the
      crusaders were supine and ignorant, without skill to contrive, or
      money to purchase, or industry to use, the artificial engines and
      implements of assault. In the conquest of Nice, they had been
      powerfully assisted by the wealth and knowledge of the Greek
      emperor: his absence was poorly supplied by some Genoese and
      Pisan vessels, that were attracted by religion or trade to the
      coast of Syria: the stores were scanty, the return precarious,
      and the communication difficult and dangerous. Indolence or
      weakness had prevented the Franks from investing the entire
      circuit; and the perpetual freedom of two gates relieved the
      wants and recruited the garrison of the city. At the end of seven
      months, after the ruin of their cavalry, and an enormous loss by
      famine, desertion and fatigue, the progress of the crusaders was
      imperceptible, and their success remote, if the Latin Ulysses,
      the artful and ambitious Bohemond, had not employed the arms of
      cunning and deceit. The Christians of Antioch were numerous and
      discontented: Phirouz, a Syrian renegado, had acquired the favor
      of the emir and the command of three towers; and the merit of his
      repentance disguised to the Latins, and perhaps to himself, the
      foul design of perfidy and treason. A secret correspondence, for
      their mutual interest, was soon established between Phirouz and
      the prince of Tarento; and Bohemond declared in the council of
      the chiefs, that he could deliver the city into their hands. 921
      But he claimed the sovereignty of Antioch as the reward of his
      service; and the proposal which had been rejected by the envy,
      was at length extorted from the distress, of his equals. The
      nocturnal surprise was executed by the French and Norman princes,
      who ascended in person the scaling-ladders that were thrown from
      the walls: their new proselyte, after the murder of his too
      scrupulous brother, embraced and introduced the servants of
      Christ; the army rushed through the gates; and the Moslems soon
      found, that although mercy was hopeless, resistance was impotent.

      But the citadel still refused to surrender; and the victims
      themselves were speedily encompassed and besieged by the
      innumerable forces of Kerboga, prince of Mosul, who, with
      twenty-eight Turkish emirs, advanced to the deliverance of
      Antioch. Five-and-twenty days the Christians spent on the verge
      of destruction; and the proud lieutenant of the caliph and the
      sultan left them only the choice of servitude or death. 93 In
      this extremity they collected the relics of their strength,
      sallied from the town, and in a single memorable day, annihilated
      or dispersed the host of Turks and Arabians, which they might
      safely report to have consisted of six hundred thousand men. 94
      Their supernatural allies I shall proceed to consider: the human
      causes of the victory of Antioch were the fearless despair of the
      Franks; and the surprise, the discord, perhaps the errors, of
      their unskilful and presumptuous adversaries. The battle is
      described with as much disorder as it was fought; but we may
      observe the tent of Kerboga, a movable and spacious palace,
      enriched with the luxury of Asia, and capable of holding above
      two thousand persons; we may distinguish his three thousand
      guards, who were cased, the horse as well as the men, in complete
      steel.

      In the eventful period of the siege and defence of Antioch, the
      crusaders were alternately exalted by victory or sunk in despair;
      either swelled with plenty or emaciated with hunger. A
      speculative reasoner might suppose, that their faith had a strong
      and serious influence on their practice; and that the soldiers of
      the cross, the deliverers of the holy sepulchre, prepared
      themselves by a sober and virtuous life for the daily
      contemplation of martyrdom. Experience blows away this charitable
      illusion; and seldom does the history of profane war display such
      scenes of intemperance and prostitution as were exhibited under
      the walls of Antioch. The grove of Daphne no longer flourished;
      but the Syrian air was still impregnated with the same vices; the
      Christians were seduced by every temptation 95 that nature either
      prompts or reprobates; the authority of the chiefs was despised;
      and sermons and edicts were alike fruitless against those
      scandalous disorders, not less pernicious to military discipline,
      than repugnant to evangelic purity. In the first days of the
      siege and the possession of Antioch, the Franks consumed with
      wanton and thoughtless prodigality the frugal subsistence of
      weeks and months: the desolate country no longer yielded a
      supply; and from that country they were at length excluded by the
      arms of the besieging Turks. Disease, the faithful companion of
      want, was envenomed by the rains of the winter, the summer heats,
      unwholesome food, and the close imprisonment of multitudes. The
      pictures of famine and pestilence are always the same, and always
      disgustful; and our imagination may suggest the nature of their
      sufferings and their resources. The remains of treasure or spoil
      were eagerly lavished in the purchase of the vilest nourishment;
      and dreadful must have been the calamities of the poor, since,
      after paying three marks of silver for a goat and fifteen for a
      lean camel, 96 the count of Flanders was reduced to beg a dinner,
      and Duke Godfrey to borrow a horse. Sixty thousand horse had been
      reviewed in the camp: before the end of the siege they were
      diminished to two thousand, and scarcely two hundred fit for
      service could be mustered on the day of battle. Weakness of body
      and terror of mind extinguished the ardent enthusiasm of the
      pilgrims; and every motive of honor and religion was subdued by
      the desire of life. 97 Among the chiefs, three heroes may be
      found without fear or reproach: Godfrey of Bouillon was supported
      by his magnanimous piety; Bohemond by ambition and interest; and
      Tancred declared, in the true spirit of chivalry, that as long as
      he was at the head of forty knights, he would never relinquish
      the enterprise of Palestine. But the count of Tholouse and
      Provence was suspected of a voluntary indisposition; the duke of
      Normandy was recalled from the sea-shore by the censures of the
      church: Hugh the Great, though he led the vanguard of the battle,
      embraced an ambiguous opportunity of returning to France and
      Stephen, count of Chartres, basely deserted the standard which he
      bore, and the council in which he presided. The soldiers were
      discouraged by the flight of William, viscount of Melun, surnamed
      the Carpenter, from the weighty strokes of his axe; and the
      saints were scandalized by the fall 971 of Peter the Hermit, who,
      after arming Europe against Asia, attempted to escape from the
      penance of a necessary fast. Of the multitude of recreant
      warriors, the names (says an historian) are blotted from the book
      of life; and the opprobrious epithet of the rope-dancers was
      applied to the deserters who dropped in the night from the walls
      of Antioch. The emperor Alexius, 98 who seemed to advance to the
      succor of the Latins, was dismayed by the assurance of their
      hopeless condition. They expected their fate in silent despair;
      oaths and punishments were tried without effect; and to rouse the
      soldiers to the defence of the walls, it was found necessary to
      set fire to their quarters.

      For their salvation and victory, they were indebted to the same
      fanaticism which had led them to the brink of ruin. In such a
      cause, and in such an army, visions, prophecies, and miracles,
      were frequent and familiar. In the distress of Antioch, they were
      repeated with unusual energy and success: St. Ambrose had assured
      a pious ecclesiastic, that two years of trial must precede the
      season of deliverance and grace; the deserters were stopped by
      the presence and reproaches of Christ himself; the dead had
      promised to arise and combat with their brethren; the Virgin had
      obtained the pardon of their sins; and their confidence was
      revived by a visible sign, the seasonable and splendid discovery
      of the Holy Lance. The policy of their chiefs has on this
      occasion been admired, and might surely be excused; but a pious
      fraud is seldom produced by the cool conspiracy of many persons;
      and a voluntary impostor might depend on the support of the wise
      and the credulity of the people. Of the diocese of Marseilles,
      there was a priest of low cunning and loose manners, and his name
      was Peter Bartholemy. He presented himself at the door of the
      council-chamber, to disclose an apparition of St. Andrew, which
      had been thrice reiterated in his sleep with a dreadful menace,
      if he presumed to suppress the commands of Heaven. “At Antioch,”
      said the apostle, “in the church of my brother St. Peter, near
      the high altar, is concealed the steel head of the lance that
      pierced the side of our Redeemer. In three days that instrument
      of eternal, and now of temporal, salvation, will be manifested to
      his disciples. Search, and ye shall find: bear it aloft in
      battle; and that mystic weapon shall penetrate the souls of the
      miscreants.” The pope’s legate, the bishop of Puy, affected to
      listen with coldness and distrust; but the revelation was eagerly
      accepted by Count Raymond, whom his faithful subject, in the name
      of the apostle, had chosen for the guardian of the holy lance.
      The experiment was resolved; and on the third day after a due
      preparation of prayer and fasting, the priest of Marseilles
      introduced twelve trusty spectators, among whom were the count
      and his chaplain; and the church doors were barred against the
      impetuous multitude. The ground was opened in the appointed
      place; but the workmen, who relieved each other, dug to the depth
      of twelve feet without discovering the object of their search. In
      the evening, when Count Raymond had withdrawn to his post, and
      the weary assistants began to murmur, Bartholemy, in his shirt,
      and without his shoes, boldly descended into the pit; the
      darkness of the hour and of the place enabled him to secrete and
      deposit the head of a Saracen lance; and the first sound, the
      first gleam, of the steel was saluted with a devout rapture. The
      holy lance was drawn from its recess, wrapped in a veil of silk
      and gold, and exposed to the veneration of the crusaders; their
      anxious suspense burst forth in a general shout of joy and hope,
      and the desponding troops were again inflamed with the enthusiasm
      of valor. Whatever had been the arts, and whatever might be the
      sentiments of the chiefs, they skilfully improved this fortunate
      revolution by every aid that discipline and devotion could
      afford. The soldiers were dismissed to their quarters with an
      injunction to fortify their minds and bodies for the approaching
      conflict, freely to bestow their last pittance on themselves and
      their horses, and to expect with the dawn of day the signal of
      victory. On the festival of St. Peter and St. Paul, the gates of
      Antioch were thrown open: a martial psalm, “Let the Lord arise,
      and let his enemies be scattered!” was chanted by a procession of
      priests and monks; the battle array was marshalled in twelve
      divisions, in honor of the twelve apostles; and the holy lance,
      in the absence of Raymond, was intrusted to the hands of his
      chaplain. The influence of his relic or trophy, was felt by the
      servants, and perhaps by the enemies, of Christ; 99 and its
      potent energy was heightened by an accident, a stratagem, or a
      rumor, of a miraculous complexion. Three knights, in white
      garments and resplendent arms, either issued, or seemed to issue,
      from the hills: the voice of Adhemar, the pope’s legate,
      proclaimed them as the martyrs St. George, St. Theodore, and St.
      Maurice: the tumult of battle allowed no time for doubt or
      scrutiny; and the welcome apparition dazzled the eyes or the
      imagination of a fanatic army. 991 In the season of danger and
      triumph, the revelation of Bartholemy of Marseilles was
      unanimously asserted; but as soon as the temporary service was
      accomplished, the personal dignity and liberal arms which the
      count of Tholouse derived from the custody of the holy lance,
      provoked the envy, and awakened the reason, of his rivals. A
      Norman clerk presumed to sift, with a philosophic spirit, the
      truth of the legend, the circumstances of the discovery, and the
      character of the prophet; and the pious Bohemond ascribed their
      deliverance to the merits and intercession of Christ alone. For a
      while, the Provincials defended their national palladium with
      clamors and arms and new visions condemned to death and hell the
      profane sceptics who presumed to scrutinize the truth and merit
      of the discovery. The prevalence of incredulity compelled the
      author to submit his life and veracity to the judgment of God. A
      pile of dry fagots, four feet high and fourteen long, was erected
      in the midst of the camp; the flames burnt fiercely to the
      elevation of thirty cubits; and a narrow path of twelve inches
      was left for the perilous trial. The unfortunate priest of
      Marseilles traversed the fire with dexterity and speed; but the
      thighs and belly were scorched by the intense heat; he expired
      the next day; 992 and the logic of believing minds will pay some
      regard to his dying protestations of innocence and truth. Some
      efforts were made by the Provincials to substitute a cross, a
      ring, or a tabernacle, in the place of the holy lance, which soon
      vanished in contempt and oblivion. 100 Yet the revelation of
      Antioch is gravely asserted by succeeding historians: and such is
      the progress of credulity, that miracles most doubtful on the
      spot, and at the moment, will be received with implicit faith at
      a convenient distance of time and space.

      The prudence or fortune of the Franks had delayed their invasion
      till the decline of the Turkish empire. 101 Under the manly
      government of the three first sultans, the kingdoms of Asia were
      united in peace and justice; and the innumerable armies which
      they led in person were equal in courage, and superior in
      discipline, to the Barbarians of the West. But at the time of the
      crusade, the inheritance of Malek Shaw was disputed by his four
      sons; their private ambition was insensible of the public danger;
      and, in the vicissitudes of their fortune, the royal vassals were
      ignorant, or regardless, of the true object of their allegiance.
      The twenty-eight emirs who marched with the standard or Kerboga
      were his rivals or enemies: their hasty levies were drawn from
      the towns and tents of Mesopotamia and Syria; and the Turkish
      veterans were employed or consumed in the civil wars beyond the
      Tigris. The caliph of Egypt embraced this opportunity of weakness
      and discord to recover his ancient possessions; and his sultan
      Aphdal besieged Jerusalem and Tyre, expelled the children of
      Ortok, and restored in Palestine the civil and ecclesiastical
      authority of the Fatimites. 102 They heard with astonishment of
      the vast armies of Christians that had passed from Europe to
      Asia, and rejoiced in the sieges and battles which broke the
      power of the Turks, the adversaries of their sect and monarchy.
      But the same Christians were the enemies of the prophet; and from
      the overthrow of Nice and Antioch, the motive of their
      enterprise, which was gradually understood, would urge them
      forwards to the banks of the Jordan, or perhaps of the Nile.

      An intercourse of epistles and embassies, which rose and fell
      with the events of war, was maintained between the throne of
      Cairo and the camp of the Latins; and their adverse pride was the
      result of ignorance and enthusiasm. The ministers of Egypt
      declared in a haughty, or insinuated in a milder, tone, that
      their sovereign, the true and lawful commander of the faithful,
      had rescued Jerusalem from the Turkish yoke; and that the
      pilgrims, if they would divide their numbers, and lay aside their
      arms, should find a safe and hospitable reception at the
      sepulchre of Jesus. In the belief of their lost condition, the
      caliph Mostali despised their arms and imprisoned their deputies:
      the conquest and victory of Antioch prompted him to solicit those
      formidable champions with gifts of horses and silk robes, of
      vases, and purses of gold and silver; and in his estimate of
      their merit or power, the first place was assigned to Bohemond,
      and the second to Godfrey. In either fortune, the answer of the
      crusaders was firm and uniform: they disdained to inquire into
      the private claims or possessions of the followers of Mahomet;
      whatsoever was his name or nation, the usurper of Jerusalem was
      their enemy; and instead of prescribing the mode and terms of
      their pilgrimage, it was only by a timely surrender of the city
      and province, their sacred right, that he could deserve their
      alliance, or deprecate their impending and irresistible attack.

      their importance than the contemporary writers.]

      Yet this attack, when they were within the view and reach of
      their glorious prize, was suspended above ten months after the
      defeat of Kerboga. The zeal and courage of the crusaders were
      chilled in the moment of victory; and instead of marching to
      improve the consternation, they hastily dispersed to enjoy the
      luxury, of Syria. The causes of this strange delay may be found
      in the want of strength and subordination. In the painful and
      various service of Antioch, the cavalry was annihilated; many
      thousands of every rank had been lost by famine, sickness, and
      desertion: the same abuse of plenty had been productive of a
      third famine; and the alternative of intemperance and distress
      had generated a pestilence, which swept away above fifty thousand
      of the pilgrims. Few were able to command, and none were willing
      to obey; the domestic feuds, which had been stifled by common
      fear, were again renewed in acts, or at least in sentiments, of
      hostility; the fortune of Baldwin and Bohemond excited the envy
      of their companions; the bravest knights were enlisted for the
      defence of their new principalities; and Count Raymond exhausted
      his troops and treasures in an idle expedition into the heart of
      Syria. 1031 The winter was consumed in discord and disorder; a
      sense of honor and religion was rekindled in the spring; and the
      private soldiers, less susceptible of ambition and jealousy,
      awakened with angry clamors the indolence of their chiefs. In the
      month of May, the relics of this mighty host proceeded from
      Antioch to Laodicea: about forty thousand Latins, of whom no more
      than fifteen hundred horse, and twenty thousand foot, were
      capable of immediate service. Their easy march was continued
      between Mount Libanus and the sea-shore: their wants were
      liberally supplied by the coasting traders of Genoa and Pisa; and
      they drew large contributions from the emirs of Tripoli, Tyre,
      Sidon, Acre, and Caesarea, who granted a free passage, and
      promised to follow the example of Jerusalem. From Caesarea they
      advanced into the midland country; their clerks recognized the
      sacred geography of Lydda, Ramla, Emmaus, and Bethlem, 1032 and
      as soon as they descried the holy city, the crusaders forgot
      their toils and claimed their reward. 104

      Chapter LVIII: The First Crusade.—Part V.

      Jerusalem has derived some reputation from the number and
      importance of her memorable sieges. It was not till after a long
      and obstinate contest that Babylon and Rome could prevail against
      the obstinacy of the people, the craggy ground that might
      supersede the necessity of fortifications, and the walls and
      towers that would have fortified the most accessible plain. 105
      These obstacles were diminished in the age of the crusades. The
      bulwarks had been completely destroyed and imperfectly restored:
      the Jews, their nation, and worship, were forever banished; but
      nature is less changeable than man, and the site of Jerusalem,
      though somewhat softened and somewhat removed, was still strong
      against the assaults of an enemy. By the experience of a recent
      siege, and a three years’ possession, the Saracens of Egypt had
      been taught to discern, and in some degree to remedy, the defects
      of a place, which religion as well as honor forbade them to
      resign. Aladin, or Iftikhar, the caliph’s lieutenant, was
      intrusted with the defence: his policy strove to restrain the
      native Christians by the dread of their own ruin and that of the
      holy sepulchre; to animate the Moslems by the assurance of
      temporal and eternal rewards. His garrison is said to have
      consisted of forty thousand Turks and Arabians; and if he could
      muster twenty thousand of the inhabitants, it must be confessed
      that the besieged were more numerous than the besieging army. 106
      Had the diminished strength and numbers of the Latins allowed
      them to grasp the whole circumference of four thousand yards,
      (about two English miles and a half, 107 to what useful purpose
      should they have descended into the valley of Ben Hinnom and
      torrent of Cedron, 108 or approach the precipices of the south
      and east, from whence they had nothing either to hope or fear?
      Their siege was more reasonably directed against the northern and
      western sides of the city. Godfrey of Bouillon erected his
      standard on the first swell of Mount Calvary: to the left, as far
      as St. Stephen’s gate, the line of attack was continued by
      Tancred and the two Roberts; and Count Raymond established his
      quarters from the citadel to the foot of Mount Sion, which was no
      longer included within the precincts of the city. On the fifth
      day, the crusaders made a general assault, in the fanatic hope of
      battering down the walls without engines, and of scaling them
      without ladders. By the dint of brutal force, they burst the
      first barrier; but they were driven back with shame and slaughter
      to the camp: the influence of vision and prophecy was deadened by
      the too frequent abuse of those pious stratagems; and time and
      labor were found to be the only means of victory. The time of the
      siege was indeed fulfilled in forty days, but they were forty
      days of calamity and anguish. A repetition of the old complaint
      of famine may be imputed in some degree to the voracious or
      disorderly appetite of the Franks; but the stony soil of
      Jerusalem is almost destitute of water; the scanty springs and
      hasty torrents were dry in the summer season; nor was the thirst
      of the besiegers relieved, as in the city, by the artificial
      supply of cisterns and aqueducts. The circumjacent country is
      equally destitute of trees for the uses of shade or building, but
      some large beams were discovered in a cave by the crusaders: a
      wood near Sichem, the enchanted grove of Tasso, 109 was cut down:
      the necessary timber was transported to the camp by the vigor and
      dexterity of Tancred; and the engines were framed by some Genoese
      artists, who had fortunately landed in the harbor of Jaffa. Two
      movable turrets were constructed at the expense, and in the
      stations, of the duke of Lorraine and the count of Tholouse, and
      rolled forwards with devout labor, not to the most accessible,
      but to the most neglected, parts of the fortification. Raymond’s
      Tower was reduced to ashes by the fire of the besieged, but his
      colleague was more vigilant and successful; 1091 the enemies were
      driven by his archers from the rampart; the draw-bridge was let
      down; and on a Friday, at three in the afternoon, the day and
      hour of the passion, Godfrey of Bouillon stood victorious on the
      walls of Jerusalem. His example was followed on every side by the
      emulation of valor; and about four hundred and sixty years after
      the conquest of Omar, the holy city was rescued from the
      Mahometan yoke. In the pillage of public and private wealth, the
      adventurers had agreed to respect the exclusive property of the
      first occupant; and the spoils of the great mosque, seventy lamps
      and massy vases of gold and silver, rewarded the diligence, and
      displayed the generosity, of Tancred. A bloody sacrifice was
      offered by his mistaken votaries to the God of the Christians:
      resistance might provoke but neither age nor sex could mollify,
      their implacable rage: they indulged themselves three days in a
      promiscuous massacre; 110 and the infection of the dead bodies
      produced an epidemical disease. After seventy thousand Moslems
      had been put to the sword, and the harmless Jews had been burnt
      in their synagogue, they could still reserve a multitude of
      captives, whom interest or lassitude persuaded them to spare. Of
      these savage heroes of the cross, Tancred alone betrayed some
      sentiments of compassion; yet we may praise the more selfish
      lenity of Raymond, who granted a capitulation and safe-conduct to
      the garrison of the citadel. 111 The holy sepulchre was now free;
      and the bloody victors prepared to accomplish their vow.
      Bareheaded and barefoot, with contrite hearts, and in an humble
      posture, they ascended the hill of Calvary, amidst the loud
      anthems of the clergy; kissed the stone which had covered the
      Savior of the world; and bedewed with tears of joy and penitence
      the monument of their redemption. This union of the fiercest and
      most tender passions has been variously considered by two
      philosophers; by the one, 112 as easy and natural; by the other,
      113 as absurd and incredible. Perhaps it is too rigorously
      applied to the same persons and the same hour; the example of the
      virtuous Godfrey awakened the piety of his companions; while they
      cleansed their bodies, they purified their minds; nor shall I
      believe that the most ardent in slaughter and rapine were the
      foremost in the procession to the holy sepulchre.

      Eight days after this memorable event, which Pope Urban did not
      live to hear, the Latin chiefs proceeded to the election of a
      king, to guard and govern their conquests in Palestine. Hugh the
      Great, and Stephen of Chartres, had retired with some loss of
      reputation, which they strove to regain by a second crusade and
      an honorable death. Baldwin was established at Edessa, and
      Bohemond at Antioch; and two Roberts, the duke of Normandy 114
      and the count of Flanders, preferred their fair inheritance in
      the West to a doubtful competition or a barren sceptre. The
      jealousy and ambition of Raymond were condemned by his own
      followers, and the free, the just, the unanimous voice of the
      army proclaimed Godfrey of Bouillon the first and most worthy of
      the champions of Christendom. His magnanimity accepted a trust as
      full of danger as of glory; but in a city where his Savior had
      been crowned with thorns, the devout pilgrim rejected the name
      and ensigns of royalty; and the founder of the kingdom of
      Jerusalem contented himself with the modest title of Defender and
      Baron of the Holy Sepulchre. His government of a single year, 115
      too short for the public happiness, was interrupted in the first
      fortnight by a summons to the field, by the approach of the
      vizier or sultan of Egypt, who had been too slow to prevent, but
      who was impatient to avenge, the loss of Jerusalem. His total
      overthrow in the battle of Ascalon sealed the establishment of
      the Latins in Syria, and signalized the valor of the French
      princes who in this action bade a long farewell to the holy wars.

      Some glory might be derived from the prodigious inequality of
      numbers, though I shall not count the myriads of horse and foot
      1151 on the side of the Fatimites; but, except three thousand
      Ethiopians or Blacks, who were armed with flails or scourges of
      iron, the Barbarians of the South fled on the first onset, and
      afforded a pleasing comparison between the active valor of the
      Turks and the sloth and effeminacy of the natives of Egypt. After
      suspending before the holy sepulchre the sword and standard of
      the sultan, the new king (he deserves the title) embraced his
      departing companions, and could retain only with the gallant
      Tancred three hundred knights, and two thousand foot-soldiers for
      the defence of Palestine. His sovereignty was soon attacked by a
      new enemy, the only one against whom Godfrey was a coward.
      Adhemar, bishop of Puy, who excelled both in council and action,
      had been swept away in the last plague at Antioch: the remaining
      ecclesiastics preserved only the pride and avarice of their
      character; and their seditious clamors had required that the
      choice of a bishop should precede that of a king. The revenue and
      jurisdiction of the lawful patriarch were usurped by the Latin
      clergy: the exclusion of the Greeks and Syrians was justified by
      the reproach of heresy or schism; 116 and, under the iron yoke of
      their deliverers, the Oriental Christians regretted the
      tolerating government of the Arabian caliphs. Daimbert,
      archbishop of Pisa, had long been trained in the secret policy of
      Rome: he brought a fleet at his countrymen to the succor of the
      Holy Land, and was installed, without a competitor, the spiritual
      and temporal head of the church. 1161 The new patriarch 117
      immediately grasped the sceptre which had been acquired by the
      toil and blood of the victorious pilgrims; and both Godfrey and
      Bohemond submitted to receive at his hands the investiture of
      their feudal possessions. Nor was this sufficient; Daimbert
      claimed the immediate property of Jerusalem and Jaffa; instead of
      a firm and generous refusal, the hero negotiated with the priest;
      a quarter of either city was ceded to the church; and the modest
      bishop was satisfied with an eventual reversion of the rest, on
      the death of Godfrey without children, or on the future
      acquisition of a new seat at Cairo or Damascus.

      marvellous candor the independence of the conquerors and kings of
      Jerusalem.]

      Without this indulgence, the conqueror would have almost been
      stripped of his infant kingdom, which consisted only of Jerusalem
      and Jaffa, with about twenty villages and towns of the adjacent
      country. 118 Within this narrow verge, the Mahometans were still
      lodged in some impregnable castles: and the husbandman, the
      trader, and the pilgrim, were exposed to daily and domestic
      hostility. By the arms of Godfrey himself, and of the two
      Baldwins, his brother and cousin, who succeeded to the throne,
      the Latins breathed with more ease and safety; and at length they
      equalled, in the extent of their dominions, though not in the
      millions of their subjects, the ancient princes of Judah and
      Israel. 119 After the reduction of the maritime cities of
      Laodicea, Tripoli, Tyre, and Ascalon, 120 which were powerfully
      assisted by the fleets of Venice, Genoa, and Pisa, and even of
      Flanders and Norway, 121 the range of sea-coast from Scanderoon
      to the borders of Egypt was possessed by the Christian pilgrims.
      If the prince of Antioch disclaimed his supremacy, the counts of
      Edessa and Tripoli owned themselves the vassals of the king of
      Jerusalem: the Latins reigned beyond the Euphrates; and the four
      cities of Hems, Hamah, Damascus, and Aleppo, were the only relics
      of the Mahometan conquests in Syria. 122 The laws and language,
      the manners and titles, of the French nation and Latin church,
      were introduced into these transmarine colonies. According to the
      feudal jurisprudence, the principal states and subordinate
      baronies descended in the line of male and female succession: 123
      but the children of the first conquerors, 124 a motley and
      degenerate race, were dissolved by the luxury of the climate; the
      arrival of new crusaders from Europe was a doubtful hope and a
      casual event. The service of the feudal tenures 125 was performed
      by six hundred and sixty-six knights, who might expect the aid of
      two hundred more under the banner of the count of Tripoli; and
      each knight was attended to the field by four squires or archers
      on horseback. 126 Five thousand and seventy sergeants, most
      probably foot-soldiers, were supplied by the churches and cities;
      and the whole legal militia of the kingdom could not exceed
      eleven thousand men, a slender defence against the surrounding
      myriads of Saracens and Turks. 127 But the firmest bulwark of
      Jerusalem was founded on the knights of the Hospital of St. John,
      128 and of the temple of Solomon; 129 on the strange association
      of a monastic and military life, which fanaticism might suggest,
      but which policy must approve. The flower of the nobility of
      Europe aspired to wear the cross, and to profess the vows, of
      these respectable orders; their spirit and discipline were
      immortal; and the speedy donation of twenty-eight thousand farms,
      or manors, 130 enabled them to support a regular force of cavalry
      and infantry for the defence of Palestine. The austerity of the
      convent soon evaporated in the exercise of arms; the world was
      scandalized by the pride, avarice, and corruption of these
      Christian soldiers; their claims of immunity and jurisdiction
      disturbed the harmony of the church and state; and the public
      peace was endangered by their jealous emulation. But in their
      most dissolute period, the knights of their hospital and temple
      maintained their fearless and fanatic character: they neglected
      to live, but they were prepared to die, in the service of Christ;
      and the spirit of chivalry, the parent and offspring of the
      crusades, has been transplanted by this institution from the holy
      sepulchre to the Isle of Malta. 131

      The spirit of freedom, which pervades the feudal institutions,
      was felt in its strongest energy by the volunteers of the cross,
      who elected for their chief the most deserving of his peers.
      Amidst the slaves of Asia, unconscious of the lesson or example,
      a model of political liberty was introduced; and the laws of the
      French kingdom are derived from the purest source of equality and
      justice. Of such laws, the first and indispensable condition is
      the assent of those whose obedience they require, and for whose
      benefit they are designed. No sooner had Godfrey of Bouillon
      accepted the office of supreme magistrate, than he solicited the
      public and private advice of the Latin pilgrims, who were the
      best skilled in the statutes and customs of Europe. From these
      materials, with the counsel and approbation of the patriarch and
      barons, of the clergy and laity, Godfrey composed the Assise of
      Jerusalem, 132 a precious monument of feudal jurisprudence. The
      new code, attested by the seals of the king, the patriarch, and
      the viscount of Jerusalem, was deposited in the holy sepulchre,
      enriched with the improvements of succeeding times, and
      respectfully consulted as often as any doubtful question arose in
      the tribunals of Palestine. With the kingdom and city all was
      lost: 133 the fragments of the written law were preserved by
      jealous tradition 134 and variable practice till the middle of
      the thirteenth century: the code was restored by the pen of John
      d’Ibelin, count of Jaffa, one of the principal feudatories; 135

      with Saladin; the queen and the principal Christians departed in
      peace; and a code so precious and so portable could not provoke
      the avarice of the conquerors. I have sometimes suspected the
      existence of this original copy of the Holy Sepulchre, which
      might be invented to sanctify and authenticate the traditionary
      customs of the French in Palestine.]

      prayer of King Amauri, (A.D. 1195-1205,) that he would commit his

      and died A.D. 1266, (Sanut, l. iii. p. ii. c. 5, 8.) The family
      of Ibelin, which descended from a younger brother of a count of
      Chartres in France, long flourished in Palestine and Cyprus, (see
      the Lignages de deca Mer, or d’Outremer, c. 6, at the end of the
      Assises de Jerusalem, an original book, which records the
      pedigrees of the French adventurers.)]

      the island: the work was finished the 3d of November, 1369,
      sealed with four seals and deposited in the cathedral of Nicosia,

      The justice and freedom of the constitution were maintained by
      two tribunals of unequal dignity, which were instituted by
      Godfrey of Bouillon after the conquest of Jerusalem. The king, in
      person, presided in the upper court, the court of the barons. Of
      these the four most conspicuous were the prince of Galilee, the
      lord of Sidon and Caesarea, and the counts of Jaffa and Tripoli,
      who, perhaps with the constable and marshal, 137 were in a
      special manner the compeers and judges of each other. But all the
      nobles, who held their lands immediately of the crown, were
      entitled and bound to attend the king’s court; and each baron
      exercised a similar jurisdiction on the subordinate assemblies of
      his own feudatories. The connection of lord and vassal was
      honorable and voluntary: reverence was due to the benefactor,
      protection to the dependant; but they mutually pledged their
      faith to each other; and the obligation on either side might be
      suspended by neglect or dissolved by injury. The cognizance of
      marriages and testaments was blended with religion, and usurped
      by the clergy: but the civil and criminal causes of the nobles,
      the inheritance and tenure of their fiefs, formed the proper
      occupation of the supreme court. Each member was the judge and
      guardian both of public and private rights. It was his duty to
      assert with his tongue and sword the lawful claims of the lord;
      but if an unjust superior presumed to violate the freedom or
      property of a vassal, the confederate peers stood forth to
      maintain his quarrel by word and deed. They boldly affirmed his
      innocence and his wrongs; demanded the restitution of his liberty
      or his lands; suspended, after a fruitless demand, their own
      service; rescued their brother from prison; and employed every
      weapon in his defence, without offering direct violence to the
      person of their lord, which was ever sacred in their eyes. 138 In
      their pleadings, replies, and rejoinders, the advocates of the
      court were subtle and copious; but the use of argument and
      evidence was often superseded by judicial combat; and the Assise
      of Jerusalem admits in many cases this barbarous institution,
      which has been slowly abolished by the laws and manners of
      Europe.

      137 (return) [ The cautious John D’Ibelin argues, rather than
      affirms, that Tripoli is the fourth barony, and expresses some
      doubt concerning the right or pretension of the constable and
      marshal, (c. 323.)]

      138 (return) [ Entre seignor et homme ne n’a que la foi;.... mais
      tant que l’homme doit a son seignor reverence en toutes choses,
      (c. 206.) Tous les hommes dudit royaume sont par ladite Assise
      tenus les uns as autres.... et en celle maniere que le seignor
      mette main ou face mettre au cors ou au fie d’aucun d’yaus sans
      esgard et sans connoissans de court, que tous les autres doivent
      venir devant le seignor, &c., (212.) The form of their
      remonstrances is conceived with the noble simplicity of freedom.]

      The trial by battle was established in all criminal cases which
      affected the life, or limb, or honor, of any person; and in all
      civil transactions, of or above the value of one mark of silver.
      It appears that in criminal cases the combat was the privilege of
      the accuser, who, except in a charge of treason, avenged his
      personal injury, or the death of those persons whom he had a
      right to represent; but wherever, from the nature of the charge,
      testimony could be obtained, it was necessary for him to produce
      witnesses of the fact. In civil cases, the combat was not allowed
      as the means of establishing the claim of the demandant; but he
      was obliged to produce witnesses who had, or assumed to have,
      knowledge of the fact. The combat was then the privilege of the
      defendant; because he charged the witness with an attempt by
      perjury to take away his right. He came therefore to be in the
      same situation as the appellant in criminal cases. It was not
      then as a mode of proof that the combat was received, nor as
      making negative evidence, (according to the supposition of
      Montesquieu; 139 but in every case the right to offer battle was
      founded on the right to pursue by arms the redress of an injury;
      and the judicial combat was fought on the same principle, and
      with the same spirit, as a private duel. Champions were only
      allowed to women, and to men maimed or past the age of sixty. The
      consequence of a defeat was death to the person accused, or to
      the champion or witness, as well as to the accuser himself: but
      in civil cases, the demandant was punished with infamy and the
      loss of his suit, while his witness and champion suffered
      ignominious death. In many cases it was in the option of the
      judge to award or to refuse the combat: but two are specified, in
      which it was the inevitable result of the challenge; if a
      faithful vassal gave the lie to his compeer, who unjustly claimed
      any portion of their lord’s demesnes; or if an unsuccessful
      suitor presumed to impeach the judgment and veracity of the
      court. He might impeach them, but the terms were severe and
      perilous: in the same day he successively fought all the members
      of the tribunal, even those who had been absent; a single defeat
      was followed by death and infamy; and where none could hope for
      victory, it is highly probable that none would adventure the
      trial. In the Assise of Jerusalem, the legal subtlety of the
      count of Jaffa is more laudably employed to elude, than to
      facilitate, the judicial combat, which he derives from a
      principle of honor rather than of superstition. 140

      years since its publication, no work has been more read and

      140 (return) [ For the intelligence of this obscure and obsolete
      jurisprudence (c. 80-111) I am deeply indebted to the friendship
      of a learned lord, who, with an accurate and discerning eye, has
      surveyed the philosophic history of law. By his studies,
      posterity might be enriched: the merit of the orator and the
      judge can be felt only by his contemporaries.]

      Among the causes which enfranchised the plebeians from the yoke
      of feudal tyranny, the institution of cities and corporations is
      one of the most powerful; and if those of Palestine are coeval
      with the first crusade, they may be ranked with the most ancient
      of the Latin world. Many of the pilgrims had escaped from their
      lords under the banner of the cross; and it was the policy of the
      French princes to tempt their stay by the assurance of the rights
      and privileges of freemen. It is expressly declared in the Assise
      of Jerusalem, that after instituting, for his knights and barons,
      the court of peers, in which he presided himself, Godfrey of
      Bouillon established a second tribunal, in which his person was
      represented by his viscount. The jurisdiction of this inferior
      court extended over the burgesses of the kingdom; and it was
      composed of a select number of the most discreet and worthy
      citizens, who were sworn to judge, according to the laws of the
      actions and fortunes of their equals. 141 In the conquest and
      settlement of new cities, the example of Jerusalem was imitated
      by the kings and their great vassals; and above thirty similar
      corporations were founded before the loss of the Holy Land.
      Another class of subjects, the Syrians, 142 or Oriental
      Christians, were oppressed by the zeal of the clergy, and
      protected by the toleration of the state. Godfrey listened to
      their reasonable prayer, that they might be judged by their own
      national laws. A third court was instituted for their use, of
      limited and domestic jurisdiction: the sworn members were
      Syrians, in blood, language, and religion; but the office of the
      president (in Arabic, of the rais) was sometimes exercised by the
      viscount of the city. At an immeasurable distance below the
      nobles, the burgesses, and the strangers, the Assise of Jerusalem
      condescends to mention the villains and slaves, the peasants of
      the land and the captives of war, who were almost equally
      considered as the objects of property. The relief or protection
      of these unhappy men was not esteemed worthy of the care of the
      legislator; but he diligently provides for the recovery, though
      not indeed for the punishment, of the fugitives. Like hounds, or
      hawks, who had strayed from the lawful owner, they might be lost
      and claimed: the slave and falcon were of the same value; but
      three slaves, or twelve oxen, were accumulated to equal the price
      of the war-horse; and a sum of three hundred pieces of gold was
      fixed, in the age of chivalry, as the equivalent of the more
      noble animal. 143

      141 (return) [ Louis le Gros, who is considered as the father of
      this institution in France, did not begin his reign till nine
      years (A.D. 1108) after Godfrey of Bouillon, (Assises, c. 2,
      324.) For its origin and effects, see the judicious remarks of
      Dr. Robertson, (History of Charles V. vol. i. p. 30-36, 251-265,
      quarto edition.)]

      142 (return) [ Every reader conversant with the historians of the
      crusades will understand by the peuple des Suriens, the Oriental
      Christians, Melchites, Jacobites, or Nestorians, who had all
      adopted the use of the Arabic language, (vol. iv. p. 593.)]

      143 (return) [ See the Assises de Jerusalem, (310, 311, 312.)
      These laws were enacted as late as the year 1350, in the kingdom
      of Cyprus. In the same century, in the reign of Edward I., I
      understand, from a late publication, (of his Book of Account,)
      that the price of a war-horse was not less exorbitant in
      England.]
