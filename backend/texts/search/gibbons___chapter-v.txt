     Public Sale Of The Empire To Didius Julianus By The Prætorian
     Guards—Clodius Albinus In Britain, Pescennius Niger In Syria, And
     Septimius Severus In Pannonia, Declare Against The Murderers Of
     Pertinax—Civil Wars And Victory Of Severus Over His Three
     Rivals—Relaxation Of Discipline—New Maxims Of Government.

      The power of the sword is more sensibly felt in an extensive
      monarchy, than in a small community. It has been calculated by
      the ablest politicians, that no state, without being soon
      exhausted, can maintain above the hundredth part of its members
      in arms and idleness. But although this relative proportion may
      be uniform, the influence of the army over the rest of the
      society will vary according to the degree of its positive
      strength. The advantages of military science and discipline
      cannot be exerted, unless a proper number of soldiers are united
      into one body, and actuated by one soul. With a handful of men,
      such a union would be ineffectual; with an unwieldy host, it
      would be impracticable; and the powers of the machine would be
      alike destroyed by the extreme minuteness or the excessive weight
      of its springs. To illustrate this observation, we need only
      reflect, that there is no superiority of natural strength,
      artificial weapons, or acquired skill, which could enable one man
      to keep in constant subjection one hundred of his
      fellow-creatures: the tyrant of a single town, or a small
      district, would soon discover that a hundred armed followers were
      a weak defence against ten thousand peasants or citizens; but a
      hundred thousand well-disciplined soldiers will command, with
      despotic sway, ten millions of subjects; and a body of ten or
      fifteen thousand guards will strike terror into the most numerous
      populace that ever crowded the streets of an immense capital.

      The Prætorian bands, whose licentious fury was the first symptom
      and cause of the decline of the Roman empire, scarcely amounted
      to the last-mentioned number. 1 They derived their institution
      from Augustus. That crafty tyrant, sensible that laws might
      color, but that arms alone could maintain, his usurped dominion,
      had gradually formed this powerful body of guards, in constant
      readiness to protect his person, to awe the senate, and either to
      prevent or to crush the first motions of rebellion. He
      distinguished these favored troops by a double pay and superior
      privileges; but, as their formidable aspect would at once have
      alarmed and irritated the Roman people, three cohorts only were
      stationed in the capital, whilst the remainder was dispersed in
      the adjacent towns of Italy. 2 But after fifty years of peace and
      servitude, Tiberius ventured on a decisive measure, which forever
      rivetted the fetters of his country. Under the fair pretences of
      relieving Italy from the heavy burden of military quarters, and
      of introducing a stricter discipline among the guards, he
      assembled them at Rome, in a permanent camp, 3 which was
      fortified with skilful care, 4 and placed on a commanding
      situation. 5

      1 (return) [ They were originally nine or ten thousand men, (for
      Tacitus and son are not agreed upon the subject,) divided into as
      many cohorts. Vitellius increased them to sixteen thousand, and
      as far as we can learn from inscriptions, they never afterwards
      sunk much below that number. See Lipsius de magnitudine Romana,
      i. 4.]

      hills: neither Donatus nor Nardini justify this position.
      (Whitaker’s Review. p. 13.) At the northern extremity of this
      hill (the Viminal) are some considerable remains of a walled
      enclosure which bears all the appearance of a Roman camp, and
      therefore is generally thought to correspond with the Castra
      Prætoria. Cramer’s Italy 390.—M.]

      Such formidable servants are always necessary, but often fatal to
      the throne of despotism. By thus introducing the Prætorian guards
      as it were into the palace and the senate, the emperors taught
      them to perceive their own strength, and the weakness of the
      civil government; to view the vices of their masters with
      familiar contempt, and to lay aside that reverential awe, which
      distance only, and mystery, can preserve towards an imaginary
      power. In the luxurious idleness of an opulent city, their pride
      was nourished by the sense of their irresistible weight; nor was
      it possible to conceal from them, that the person of the
      sovereign, the authority of the senate, the public treasure, and
      the seat of empire, were all in their hands. To divert the
      Prætorian bands from these dangerous reflections, the firmest and
      best established princes were obliged to mix blandishments with
      commands, rewards with punishments, to flatter their pride,
      indulge their pleasures, connive at their irregularities, and to
      purchase their precarious faith by a liberal donative; which,
      since the elevation of Claudius, was enacted as a legal claim, on
      the accession of every new emperor. 6

      6 (return) [ Claudius, raised by the soldiers to the empire, was
      the first who gave a donative. He gave quina dena, 120l. (Sueton.
      in Claud. c. 10: ) when Marcus, with his colleague Lucius Versus,
      took quiet possession of the throne, he gave vicena, 160l. to
      each of the guards. Hist. August. p. 25, (Dion, l. lxxiii. p.
      1231.) We may form some idea of the amount of these sums, by
      Hadrian’s complaint that the promotion of a Cæsar had cost him
      ter millies, two millions and a half sterling.]

      The advocate of the guards endeavored to justify by arguments the
      power which they asserted by arms; and to maintain that,
      according to the purest principles of the constitution, _their_
      consent was essentially necessary in the appointment of an
      emperor. The election of consuls, of generals, and of
      magistrates, however it had been recently usurped by the senate,
      was the ancient and undoubted right of the Roman people. 7 But
      where was the Roman people to be found? Not surely amongst the
      mixed multitude of slaves and strangers that filled the streets
      of Rome; a servile populace, as devoid of spirit as destitute of
      property. The defenders of the state, selected from the flower of
      the Italian youth, 8 and trained in the exercise of arms and
      virtue, were the genuine representatives of the people, and the
      best entitled to elect the military chief of the republic. These
      assertions, however defective in reason, became unanswerable when
      the fierce Prætorians increased their weight, by throwing, like
      the barbarian conqueror of Rome, their swords into the scale. 9

      7 (return) [ Cicero de Legibus, iii. 3. The first book of Livy,
      and the second of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, show the authority
      of the people, even in the election of the kings.]

      8 (return) [ They were originally recruited in Latium, Etruria,
      and the old colonies, (Tacit. Annal. iv. 5.) The emperor Otho
      compliments their vanity with the flattering titles of Italiæ,
      Alumni, Romana were juventus. Tacit. Hist. i. 84.]

      9 (return) [ In the siege of Rome by the Gauls. See Livy, v. 48.

      The Prætorians had violated the sanctity of the throne by the
      atrocious murder of Pertinax; they dishonored the majesty of it
      by their subsequent conduct. The camp was without a leader, for
      even the præfect Lætus, who had excited the tempest, prudently
      declined the public indignation. Amidst the wild disorder,
      Sulpicianus, the emperor’s father-in-law, and governor of the
      city, who had been sent to the camp on the first alarm of mutiny,
      was endeavoring to calm the fury of the multitude, when he was
      silenced by the clamorous return of the murderers, bearing on a
      lance the head of Pertinax. Though history has accustomed us to
      observe every principle and every passion yielding to the
      imperious dictates of ambition, it is scarcely credible that, in
      these moments of horror, Sulpicianus should have aspired to
      ascend a throne polluted with the recent blood of so near a
      relation and so excellent a prince. He had already begun to use
      the only effectual argument, and to treat for the Imperial
      dignity; but the more prudent of the Prætorians, apprehensive
      that, in this private contract, they should not obtain a just
      price for so valuable a commodity, ran out upon the ramparts;
      and, with a loud voice, proclaimed that the Roman world was to be
      disposed of to the best bidder by public auction. 10

      10 (return) [ Dion, L. lxxiii. p. 1234. Herodian, l. ii. p. 63.
      Hist. August p. 60. Though the three historians agree that it was
      in fact an auction, Herodian alone affirms that it was proclaimed
      as such by the soldiers.]

      This infamous offer, the most insolent excess of military
      license, diffused a universal grief, shame, and indignation
      throughout the city. It reached at length the ears of Didius
      Julianus, a wealthy senator, who, regardless of the public
      calamities, was indulging himself in the luxury of the table. 11
      His wife and his daughter, his freedmen and his parasites, easily
      convinced him that he deserved the throne, and earnestly conjured
      him to embrace so fortunate an opportunity. The vain old man
      hastened to the Prætorian camp, where Sulpicianus was still in
      treaty with the guards, and began to bid against him from the
      foot of the rampart. The unworthy negotiation was transacted by
      faithful emissaries, who passed alternately from one candidate to
      the other, and acquainted each of them with the offers of his
      rival. Sulpicianus had already promised a donative of five
      thousand drachms (above one hundred and sixty pounds) to each
      soldier; when Julian, eager for the prize, rose at once to the
      sum of six thousand two hundred and fifty drachms, or upwards of
      two hundred pounds sterling. The gates of the camp were instantly
      thrown open to the purchaser; he was declared emperor, and
      received an oath of allegiance from the soldiers, who retained
      humanity enough to stipulate that he should pardon and forget the
      competition of Sulpicianus. 111

      11 (return) [ Spartianus softens the most odious parts of the
      character and elevation of Julian.]

      111 (return) [ One of the principal causes of the preference of
      Julianus by the soldiers, was the dexterty dexterity with which
      he reminded them that Sulpicianus would not fail to revenge on
      them the death of his son-in-law. (See Dion, p. 1234, 1234. c.
      11. Herod. ii. 6.)—W.]

      It was now incumbent on the Prætorians to fulfil the conditions
      of the sale. They placed their new sovereign, whom they served
      and despised, in the centre of their ranks, surrounded him on
      every side with their shields, and conducted him in close order
      of battle through the deserted streets of the city. The senate
      was commanded to assemble; and those who had been the
      distinguished friends of Pertinax, or the personal enemies of
      Julian, found it necessary to affect a more than common share of
      satisfaction at this happy revolution. 12 After Julian had filled
      the senate house with armed soldiers, he expatiated on the
      freedom of his election, his own eminent virtues, and his full
      assurance of the affections of the senate. The obsequious
      assembly congratulated their own and the public felicity; engaged
      their allegiance, and conferred on him all the several branches
      of the Imperial power. 13 From the senate Julian was conducted,
      by the same military procession, to take possession of the
      palace. The first objects that struck his eyes, were the
      abandoned trunk of Pertinax, and the frugal entertainment
      prepared for his supper. The one he viewed with indifference, the
      other with contempt. A magnificent feast was prepared by his
      order, and he amused himself, till a very late hour, with dice,
      and the performances of Pylades, a celebrated dancer. Yet it was
      observed, that after the crowd of flatterers dispersed, and left
      him to darkness, solitude, and terrible reflection, he passed a
      sleepless night; revolving most probably in his mind his own rash
      folly, the fate of his virtuous predecessor, and the doubtful and
      dangerous tenure of an empire which had not been acquired by
      merit, but purchased by money. 14

      personal enemy to Julian, i. lxxiii. p. 1235.]

      13 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 61. We learn from thence one
      curious circumstance, that the new emperor, whatever had been his
      birth, was immediately aggregated to the number of patrician
      families. Note: A new fragment of Dion shows some shrewdness in
      the character of Julian. When the senate voted him a golden
      statue, he preferred one of brass, as more lasting. He “had
      always observed,” he said, “that the statues of former emperors
      were soon destroyed. Those of brass alone remained.” The
      indignant historian adds that he was wrong. The virtue of
      sovereigns alone preserves their images: the brazen statue of
      Julian was broken to pieces at his death. Mai. Fragm. Vatican. p.
      226.—M.]

      14 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxiii. p. 1235. Hist. August. p. 61. I
      have endeavored to blend into one consistent story the seeming
      contradictions of the two writers. * Note: The contradiction as
      M. Guizot observed, is irreconcilable. He quotes both passages:
      in one Julianus is represented as a miser, in the other as a
      voluptuary. In the one he refuses to eat till the body of
      Pertinax has been buried; in the other he gluts himself with
      every luxury almost in the sight of his headless remains.—M.]

      He had reason to tremble. On the throne of the world he found
      himself without a friend, and even without an adherent. The
      guards themselves were ashamed of the prince whom their avarice
      had persuaded them to accept; nor was there a citizen who did not
      consider his elevation with horror, as the last insult on the
      Roman name. The nobility, whose conspicuous station, and ample
      possessions, exacted the strictest caution, dissembled their
      sentiments, and met the affected civility of the emperor with
      smiles of complacency and professions of duty. But the people,
      secure in their numbers and obscurity, gave a free vent to their
      passions. The streets and public places of Rome resounded with
      clamors and imprecations. The enraged multitude affronted the
      person of Julian, rejected his liberality, and, conscious of the
      impotence of their own resentment, they called aloud on the
      legions of the frontiers to assert the violated majesty of the
      Roman empire. The public discontent was soon diffused from the
      centre to the frontiers of the empire. The armies of Britain, of
      Syria, and of Illyricum, lamented the death of Pertinax, in whose
      company, or under whose command, they had so often fought and
      conquered. They received with surprise, with indignation, and
      perhaps with envy, the extraordinary intelligence, that the
      Prætorians had disposed of the empire by public auction; and they
      sternly refused to ratify the ignominious bargain. Their
      immediate and unanimous revolt was fatal to Julian, but it was
      fatal at the same time to the public peace, as the generals of
      the respective armies, Clodius Albinus, Pescennius Niger, and
      Septimius Severus, were still more anxious to succeed than to
      revenge the murdered Pertinax. Their forces were exactly
      balanced. Each of them was at the head of three legions, 15 with
      a numerous train of auxiliaries; and however different in their
      characters, they were all soldiers of experience and capacity.

      15 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxiii. p. 1235.]

      Clodius Albinus, governor of Britain, surpassed both his
      competitors in the nobility of his extraction, which he derived
      from some of the most illustrious names of the old republic. 16
      But the branch from which he claimed his descent was sunk into
      mean circumstances, and transplanted into a remote province. It
      is difficult to form a just idea of his true character. Under the
      philosophic cloak of austerity, he stands accused of concealing
      most of the vices which degrade human nature. 17 But his accusers
      are those venal writers who adored the fortune of Severus, and
      trampled on the ashes of an unsuccessful rival. Virtue, or the
      appearances of virtue, recommended Albinus to the confidence and
      good opinion of Marcus; and his preserving with the son the same
      interest which he had acquired with the father, is a proof at
      least that he was possessed of a very flexible disposition. The
      favor of a tyrant does not always suppose a want of merit in the
      object of it; he may, without intending it, reward a man of worth
      and ability, or he may find such a man useful to his own service.
      It does not appear that Albinus served the son of Marcus, either
      as the minister of his cruelties, or even as the associate of his
      pleasures. He was employed in a distant honorable command, when
      he received a confidential letter from the emperor, acquainting
      him of the treasonable designs of some discontented generals, and
      authorizing him to declare himself the guardian and successor of
      the throne, by assuming the title and ensigns of Cæsar. 18 The
      governor of Britain wisely declined the dangerous honor, which
      would have marked him for the jealousy, or involved him in the
      approaching ruin, of Commodus. He courted power by nobler, or, at
      least, by more specious arts. On a premature report of the death
      of the emperor, he assembled his troops; and, in an eloquent
      discourse, deplored the inevitable mischiefs of despotism,
      described the happiness and glory which their ancestors had
      enjoyed under the consular government, and declared his firm
      resolution to reinstate the senate and people in their legal
      authority. This popular harangue was answered by the loud
      acclamations of the British legions, and received at Rome with a
      secret murmur of applause. Safe in the possession of his little
      world, and in the command of an army less distinguished indeed
      for discipline than for numbers and valor, 19 Albinus braved the
      menaces of Commodus, maintained towards Pertinax a stately
      ambiguous reserve, and instantly declared against the usurpation
      of Julian. The convulsions of the capital added new weight to his
      sentiments, or rather to his professions of patriotism. A regard
      to decency induced him to decline the lofty titles of Augustus
      and Emperor; and he imitated perhaps the example of Galba, who,
      on a similar occasion, had styled himself the Lieutenant of the
      senate and people. 20

      Personal merit alone had raised Pescennius Niger, from an obscure
      birth and station, to the government of Syria; a lucrative and
      important command, which in times of civil confusion gave him a
      near prospect of the throne. Yet his parts seem to have been
      better suited to the second than to the first rank; he was an
      unequal rival, though he might have approved himself an excellent
      lieutenant, to Severus, who afterwards displayed the greatness of
      his mind by adopting several useful institutions from a
      vanquished enemy. 21 In his government Niger acquired the esteem
      of the soldiers and the love of the provincials. His rigid
      discipline fortified the valor and confirmed the obedience of the
      former, whilst the voluptuous Syrians were less delighted with
      the mild firmness of his administration, than with the affability
      of his manners, and the apparent pleasure with which he attended
      their frequent and pompous festivals. 22 As soon as the
      intelligence of the atrocious murder of Pertinax had reached
      Antioch, the wishes of Asia invited Niger to assume the Imperial
      purple and revenge his death. The legions of the eastern frontier
      embraced his cause; the opulent but unarmed provinces, from the
      frontiers of Æthiopia 23 to the Hadriatic, cheerfully submitted
      to his power; and the kings beyond the Tigris and the Euphrates
      congratulated his election, and offered him their homage and
      services. The mind of Niger was not capable of receiving this
      sudden tide of fortune: he flattered himself that his accession
      would be undisturbed by competition and unstained by civil blood;
      and whilst he enjoyed the vain pomp of triumph, he neglected to
      secure the means of victory. Instead of entering into an
      effectual negotiation with the powerful armies of the West, whose
      resolution might decide, or at least must balance, the mighty
      contest; instead of advancing without delay towards Rome and
      Italy, where his presence was impatiently expected, 24 Niger
      trifled away in the luxury of Antioch those irretrievable moments
      which were diligently improved by the decisive activity of
      Severus. 25

      The country of Pannonia and Dalmatia, which occupied the space
      between the Danube and the Hadriatic, was one of the last and
      most difficult conquests of the Romans. In the defence of
      national freedom, two hundred thousand of these barbarians had
      once appeared in the field, alarmed the declining age of
      Augustus, and exercised the vigilant prudence of Tiberius at the
      head of the collected force of the empire. 26 The Pannonians
      yielded at length to the arms and institutions of Rome. Their
      recent subjection, however, the neighborhood, and even the
      mixture, of the unconquered tribes, and perhaps the climate,
      adapted, as it has been observed, to the production of great
      bodies and slow minds, 27 all contributed to preserve some
      remains of their original ferocity, and under the tame and
      uniform countenance of Roman provincials, the hardy features of
      the natives were still to be discerned. Their warlike youth
      afforded an inexhaustible supply of recruits to the legions
      stationed on the banks of the Danube, and which, from a perpetual
      warfare against the Germans and Sarmazans, were deservedly
      esteemed the best troops in the service.

      27 (return) [ Such is the reflection of Herodian, l. ii. p. 74.
      Will the modern Austrians allow the influence?]

      The Pannonian army was at this time commanded by Septimius
      Severus, a native of Africa, who, in the gradual ascent of
      private honors, had concealed his daring ambition, which was
      never diverted from its steady course by the allurements of
      pleasure, the apprehension of danger, or the feelings of
      humanity. 28 On the first news of the murder of Pertinax, he
      assembled his troops, painted in the most lively colors the
      crime, the insolence, and the weakness of the Prætorian guards,
      and animated the legions to arms and to revenge. He concluded
      (and the peroration was thought extremely eloquent) with
      promising every soldier about four hundred pounds; an honorable
      donative, double in value to the infamous bribe with which Julian
      had purchased the empire. 29 The acclamations of the army
      immediately saluted Severus with the names of Augustus, Pertinax,
      and Emperor; and he thus attained the lofty station to which he
      was invited, by conscious merit and a long train of dreams and
      omens, the fruitful offsprings either of his superstition or
      policy. 30

      The new candidate for empire saw and improved the peculiar
      advantage of his situation. His province extended to the Julian
      Alps, which gave an easy access into Italy; and he remembered the
      saying of Augustus, that a Pannonian army might in ten days
      appear in sight of Rome. 31 By a celerity proportioned to the
      greatness of the occasion, he might reasonably hope to revenge
      Pertinax, punish Julian, and receive the homage of the senate and
      people, as their lawful emperor, before his competitors,
      separated from Italy by an immense tract of sea and land, were
      apprised of his success, or even of his election. During the
      whole expedition, he scarcely allowed himself any moments for
      sleep or food; marching on foot, and in complete armor, at the
      head of his columns, he insinuated himself into the confidence
      and affection of his troops, pressed their diligence, revived
      their spirits, animated their hopes, and was well satisfied to
      share the hardships of the meanest soldier, whilst he kept in
      view the infinite superiority of his reward.

      The wretched Julian had expected, and thought himself prepared,
      to dispute the empire with the governor of Syria; but in the
      invincible and rapid approach of the Pannonian legions, he saw
      his inevitable ruin. The hasty arrival of every messenger
      increased his just apprehensions. He was successively informed,
      that Severus had passed the Alps; that the Italian cities,
      unwilling or unable to oppose his progress, had received him with
      the warmest professions of joy and duty; that the important place
      of Ravenna had surrendered without resistance, and that the
      Hadriatic fleet was in the hands of the conqueror. The enemy was
      now within two hundred and fifty miles of Rome; and every moment
      diminished the narrow span of life and empire allotted to Julian.

      He attempted, however, to prevent, or at least to protract, his
      ruin. He implored the venal faith of the Prætorians, filled the
      city with unavailing preparations for war, drew lines round the
      suburbs, and even strengthened the fortifications of the palace;
      as if those last intrenchments could be defended, without hope of
      relief, against a victorious invader. Fear and shame prevented
      the guards from deserting his standard; but they trembled at the
      name of the Pannonian legions, commanded by an experienced
      general, and accustomed to vanquish the barbarians on the frozen
      Danube. 32 They quitted, with a sigh, the pleasures of the baths
      and theatres, to put on arms, whose use they had almost
      forgotten, and beneath the weight of which they were oppressed.
      The unpractised elephants, whose uncouth appearance, it was
      hoped, would strike terror into the army of the north, threw
      their unskilful riders; and the awkward evolutions of the
      marines, drawn from the fleet of Misenum, were an object of
      ridicule to the populace; whilst the senate enjoyed, with secret
      pleasure, the distress and weakness of the usurper. 33

      elephants were kept for processions, perhaps for the games. Se

      Every motion of Julian betrayed his trembling perplexity. He
      insisted that Severus should be declared a public enemy by the
      senate. He entreated that the Pannonian general might be
      associated to the empire. He sent public ambassadors of consular
      rank to negotiate with his rival; he despatched private assassins
      to take away his life. He designed that the Vestal virgins, and
      all the colleges of priests, in their sacerdotal habits, and
      bearing before them the sacred pledges of the Roman religion,
      should advance in solemn procession to meet the Pannonian
      legions; and, at the same time, he vainly tried to interrogate,
      or to appease, the fates, by magic ceremonies and unlawful
      sacrifices. 34

      Chapter V: Sale Of The Empire To Didius Julianus.—Part II.

      Severus, who dreaded neither his arms nor his enchantments,
      guarded himself from the only danger of secret conspiracy, by the
      faithful attendance of six hundred chosen men, who never quitted
      his person or their cuirasses, either by night or by day, during
      the whole march. Advancing with a steady and rapid course, he
      passed, without difficulty, the defiles of the Apennine, received
      into his party the troops and ambassadors sent to retard his
      progress, and made a short halt at Interamnia, about seventy
      miles from Rome. His victory was already secure, but the despair
      of the Prætorians might have rendered it bloody; and Severus had
      the laudable ambition of ascending the throne without drawing the
      sword. 35 His emissaries, dispersed in the capital, assured the
      guards, that provided they would abandon their worthless prince,
      and the perpetrators of the murder of Pertinax, to the justice of
      the conqueror, he would no longer consider that melancholy event
      as the act of the whole body. The faithless Prætorians, whose
      resistance was supported only by sullen obstinacy, gladly
      complied with the easy conditions, seized the greatest part of
      the assassins, and signified to the senate, that they no longer
      defended the cause of Julian. That assembly, convoked by the
      consul, unanimously acknowledged Severus as lawful emperor,
      decreed divine honors to Pertinax, and pronounced a sentence of
      deposition and death against his unfortunate successor. Julian
      was conducted into a private apartment of the baths of the
      palace, and beheaded as a common criminal, after having
      purchased, with an immense treasure, an anxious and precarious
      reign of only sixty-six days. 36 The almost incredible expedition
      of Severus, who, in so short a space of time, conducted a
      numerous army from the banks of the Danube to those of the Tyber,
      proves at once the plenty of provisions produced by agriculture
      and commerce, the goodness of the roads, the discipline of the
      legions, and the indolent, subdued temper of the provinces. 37

      35 (return) [ Victor and Eutropius, viii. 17, mention a combat
      near the Milvian bridge, the Ponte Molle, unknown to the better

      36 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxiii. p. 1240. Herodian, l. ii. p. 83.

      37 (return) [ From these sixty-six days, we must first deduct
      sixteen, as Pertinax was murdered on the 28th of March, and
      Severus most probably elected on the 13th of April, (see Hist.
      August. p. 65, and Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iii. p.
      393, note 7.) We cannot allow less than ten days after his
      election, to put a numerous army in motion. Forty days remain for
      this rapid march; and as we may compute about eight hundred miles
      from Rome to the neighborhood of Vienna, the army of Severus
      marched twenty miles every day, without halt or intermission.]

      The first cares of Severus were bestowed on two measures, the one
      dictated by policy, the other by decency; the revenge, and the
      honors, due to the memory of Pertinax. Before the new emperor
      entered Rome, he issued his commands to the Prætorian guards,
      directing them to wait his arrival on a large plain near the
      city, without arms, but in the habits of ceremony, in which they
      were accustomed to attend their sovereign. He was obeyed by those
      haughty troops, whose contrition was the effect of their just
      terrors. A chosen part of the Illyrian army encompassed them with
      levelled spears. Incapable of flight or resistance, they expected
      their fate in silent consternation. Severus mounted the tribunal,
      sternly reproached them with perfidy and cowardice, dismissed
      them with ignominy from the trust which they had betrayed,
      despoiled them of their splendid ornaments, and banished them, on
      pain of death, to the distance of a hundred miles from the
      capital. During the transaction, another detachment had been sent
      to seize their arms, occupy their camp, and prevent the hasty
      consequences of their despair. 38

      38 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxiv. p. 1241. Herodian, l. ii. p. 84.]
      The funeral and consecration of Pertinax was next solemnized with
      every circumstance of sad magnificence. 39 The senate, with a
      melancholy pleasure, performed the last rites to that excellent
      prince, whom they had loved, and still regretted. The concern of
      his successor was probably less sincere; he esteemed the virtues
      of Pertinax, but those virtues would forever have confined his
      ambition to a private station. Severus pronounced his funeral
      oration with studied eloquence, inward satisfaction, and
      well-acted sorrow; and by this pious regard to his memory,
      convinced the credulous multitude, that _he alone_ was worthy to
      supply his place. Sensible, however, that arms, not ceremonies,
      must assert his claim to the empire, he left Rome at the end of
      thirty days, and without suffering himself to be elated by this
      easy victory, prepared to encounter his more formidable rivals.

      39 (return) [ Dion, (l. lxxiv. p. 1244,) who assisted at the
      ceremony as a senator, gives a most pompous description of it.]

      The uncommon abilities and fortune of Severus have induced an
      elegant historian to compare him with the first and greatest of
      the Cæsars. 40 The parallel is, at least, imperfect. Where shall
      we find, in the character of Severus, the commanding superiority
      of soul, the generous clemency, and the various genius, which
      could reconcile and unite the love of pleasure, the thirst of
      knowledge, and the fire of ambition? 41 In one instance only,
      they may be compared, with some degree of propriety, in the
      celerity of their motions, and their civil victories. In less
      than four years, 42 Severus subdued the riches of the East, and
      the valor of the West. He vanquished two competitors of
      reputation and ability, and defeated numerous armies, provided
      with weapons and discipline equal to his own. In that age, the
      art of fortification, and the principles of tactics, were well
      understood by all the Roman generals; and the constant
      superiority of Severus was that of an artist, who uses the same
      instruments with more skill and industry than his rivals. I shall
      not, however, enter into a minute narrative of these military
      operations; but as the two civil wars against Niger and against
      Albinus were almost the same in their conduct, event, and
      consequences, I shall collect into one point of view the most
      striking circumstances, tending to develop the character of the
      conqueror and the state of the empire.

      siege against the power of Egypt, and conversing with the sages

      capacity, which was the wonder even of the Romans themselves. The

      in point of eloquence; comparable to any in the attainments of
      wisdom, in an age made up of the greatest commanders, statesmen,
      orators, and philosophers, that ever appeared in the world; an
      author who composed a perfect specimen of military annals in his

      another writing a treatise on punuing, and collecting a set of
      good sayings; fighting and making love at the same moment, and
      willing to abandon both his empire and his mistress for a sight
      of the fountains of the Nile. Such did Julius Cæsar appear to his
      contemporaries, and to those of the subsequent ages who were the
      most inclined to deplore and execrate his fatal genius.” Note 47

      Falsehood and insincerity, unsuitable as they seem to the dignity
      of public transactions, offend us with a less degrading idea of
      meanness, than when they are found in the intercourse of private
      life. In the latter, they discover a want of courage; in the
      other, only a defect of power: and, as it is impossible for the
      most able statesmen to subdue millions of followers and enemies
      by their own personal strength, the world, under the name of
      policy, seems to have granted them a very liberal indulgence of
      craft and dissimulation. Yet the arts of Severus cannot be
      justified by the most ample privileges of state reason. He
      promised only to betray, he flattered only to ruin; and however
      he might occasionally bind himself by oaths and treaties, his
      conscience, obsequious to his interest, always released him from
      the inconvenient obligation. 43

      43 (return) [ Herodian, l. ii. p. 85.]

      If his two competitors, reconciled by their common danger, had
      advanced upon him without delay, perhaps Severus would have sunk
      under their united effort. Had they even attacked him, at the
      same time, with separate views and separate armies, the contest
      might have been long and doubtful. But they fell, singly and
      successively, an easy prey to the arts as well as arms of their
      subtle enemy, lulled into security by the moderation of his
      professions, and overwhelmed by the rapidity of his action. He
      first marched against Niger, whose reputation and power he the
      most dreaded: but he declined any hostile declarations,
      suppressed the name of his antagonist, and only signified to the
      senate and people his intention of regulating the eastern
      provinces. In private, he spoke of Niger, his old friend and
      intended successor, 44 with the most affectionate regard, and
      highly applauded his generous design of revenging the murder of
      Pertinax. To punish the vile usurper of the throne, was the duty
      of every Roman general. To persevere in arms, and to resist a
      lawful emperor, acknowledged by the senate, would alone render
      him criminal. 45 The sons of Niger had fallen into his hands
      among the children of the provincial governors, detained at Rome
      as pledges for the loyalty of their parents. 46 As long as the
      power of Niger inspired terror, or even respect, they were
      educated with the most tender care, with the children of Severus
      himself; but they were soon involved in their father’s ruin, and
      removed first by exile, and afterwards by death, from the eye of
      public compassion. 47

      44 (return) [ Whilst Severus was very dangerously ill, it was
      industriously given out, that he intended to appoint Niger and
      Albinus his successors. As he could not be sincere with respect
      to both, he might not be so with regard to either. Yet Severus
      carried his hypocrisy so far, as to profess that intention in the
      memoirs of his own life.]

      45 (return) [ Hist. August. p. 65.]

      46 (return) [ This practice, invented by Commodus, proved very
      useful to Severus. He found at Rome the children of many of the

      once to intimidate, or seduce, the parents.]

      47 (return) [ Herodian, l. iii. p. 95. Hist. August. p. 67, 68.]

      Whilst Severus was engaged in his eastern war, he had reason to
      apprehend that the governor of Britain might pass the sea and the
      Alps, occupy the vacant seat of empire, and oppose his return
      with the authority of the senate and the forces of the West. The
      ambiguous conduct of Albinus, in not assuming the Imperial title,
      left room for negotiation. Forgetting, at once, his professions
      of patriotism, and the jealousy of sovereign power, he accepted
      the precarious rank of Cæsar, as a reward for his fatal
      neutrality. Till the first contest was decided, Severus treated
      the man, whom he had doomed to destruction, with every mark of
      esteem and regard. Even in the letter, in which he announced his
      victory over Niger, he styles Albinus the brother of his soul and
      empire, sends him the affectionate salutations of his wife Julia,
      and his young family, and entreats him to preserve the armies and
      the republic faithful to their common interest. The messengers
      charged with this letter were instructed to accost the Cæsar with
      respect, to desire a private audience, and to plunge their
      daggers into his heart. 48 The conspiracy was discovered, and the
      too credulous Albinus, at length, passed over to the continent,
      and prepared for an unequal contest with his rival, who rushed
      upon him at the head of a veteran and victorious army.

      The military labors of Severus seem inadequate to the importance
      of his conquests. Two engagements, 481 the one near the
      Hellespont, the other in the narrow defiles of Cilicia, decided
      the fate of his Syrian competitor; and the troops of Europe
      asserted their usual ascendant over the effeminate natives of
      Asia. 49 The battle of Lyons, where one hundred and fifty
      thousand Romans 50 were engaged, was equally fatal to Albinus.
      The valor of the British army maintained, indeed, a sharp and
      doubtful contest, with the hardy discipline of the Illyrian
      legions. The fame and person of Severus appeared, during a few
      moments, irrecoverably lost, till that warlike prince rallied his
      fainting troops, and led them on to a decisive victory. 51 The
      war was finished by that memorable day. 511

      who led back the troops to the battle, and gained the day, which

      share in the victory. Severus afterwards put him to death, either
      from fear or jealousy.—W. and G. Wenck and M. Guizot have not
      given the real statement of Herodian or of Dion. According to the
      former, Lætus appeared with his own army entire, which he was
      suspected of having designedly kept disengaged when the battle
      was still doudtful, or rather after the rout of severus. Dion
      says that he did not move till Severus had won the victory.—M.]

      The civil wars of modern Europe have been distinguished, not only
      by the fierce animosity, but likewise by the obstinate
      perseverance, of the contending factions. They have generally
      been justified by some principle, or, at least, colored by some
      pretext, of religion, freedom, or loyalty. The leaders were
      nobles of independent property and hereditary influence. The
      troops fought like men interested in the decision of the quarrel;
      and as military spirit and party zeal were strongly diffused
      throughout the whole community, a vanquished chief was
      immediately supplied with new adherents, eager to shed their
      blood in the same cause. But the Romans, after the fall of the
      republic, combated only for the choice of masters. Under the
      standard of a popular candidate for empire, a few enlisted from
      affection, some from fear, many from interest, none from
      principle. The legions, uninflamed by party zeal, were allured
      into civil war by liberal donatives, and still more liberal
      promises. A defeat, by disabling the chief from the performance
      of his engagements, dissolved the mercenary allegiance of his
      followers, and left them to consult their own safety by a timely
      desertion of an unsuccessful cause. It was of little moment to
      the provinces, under whose name they were oppressed or governed;
      they were driven by the impulsion of the present power, and as
      soon as that power yielded to a superior force, they hastened to
      implore the clemency of the conqueror, who, as he had an immense
      debt to discharge, was obliged to sacrifice the most guilty
      countries to the avarice of his soldiers. In the vast extent of
      the Roman empire, there were few fortified cities capable of
      protecting a routed army; nor was there any person, or family, or
      order of men, whose natural interest, unsupported by the powers
      of government, was capable of restoring the cause of a sinking
      party. 52

      52 (return) [ Montesquieu, Considerations sur la Grandeur et la
      Decadence des Romains, c. xiii.]

      Yet, in the contest between Niger and Severus, a single city
      deserves an honorable exception. As Byzantium was one of the
      greatest passages from Europe into Asia, it had been provided
      with a strong garrison, and a fleet of five hundred vessels was
      anchored in the harbor. 53 The impetuosity of Severus
      disappointed this prudent scheme of defence; he left to his
      generals the siege of Byzantium, forced the less guarded passage
      of the Hellespont, and, impatient of a meaner enemy, pressed
      forward to encounter his rival. Byzantium, attacked by a numerous
      and increasing army, and afterwards by the whole naval power of
      the empire, sustained a siege of three years, and remained
      faithful to the name and memory of Niger. The citizens and
      soldiers (we know not from what cause) were animated with equal
      fury; several of the principal officers of Niger, who despaired
      of, or who disdained, a pardon, had thrown themselves into this
      last refuge: the fortifications were esteemed impregnable, and,
      in the defence of the place, a celebrated engineer displayed all
      the mechanic powers known to the ancients. 54 Byzantium, at
      length, surrendered to famine. The magistrates and soldiers were
      put to the sword, the walls demolished, the privileges
      suppressed, and the destined capital of the East subsisted only
      as an open village, subject to the insulting jurisdiction of
      Perinthus. The historian Dion, who had admired the flourishing,
      and lamented the desolate, state of Byzantium, accused the
      revenge of Severus, for depriving the Roman people of the
      strongest bulwark against the barbarians of Pontus and Asia 55
      The truth of this observation was but too well justified in the
      succeeding age, when the Gothic fleets covered the Euxine, and
      passed through the undefined Bosphorus into the centre of the
      Mediterranean.

      55 (return) [ Notwithstanding the authority of Spartianus, and
      some modern Greeks, we may be assured, from Dion and Herodian,
      that Byzantium, many years after the death of Severus, lay in
      ruins. There is no contradiction between the relation of Dion and
      that of Spartianus and the modern Greeks. Dion does not say that
      Severus destroyed Byzantium, but that he deprived it of its
      franchises and privileges, stripped the inhabitants of their
      property, razed the fortifications, and subjected the city to the
      jurisdiction of Perinthus. Therefore, when Spartian, Suidas,
      Cedrenus, say that Severus and his son Antoninus restored to
      Byzantium its rights and franchises, ordered temples to be built,
      &c., this is easily reconciled with the relation of Dion. Perhaps
      the latter mentioned it in some of the fragments of his history
      which have been lost. As to Herodian, his expressions are
      evidently exaggerated, and he has been guilty of so many
      inaccuracies in the history of Severus, that we have a right to
      suppose one in this passage.—G. from W Wenck and M. Guizot have
      omitted to cite Zosimus, who mentions a particular portico built
      by Severus, and called, apparently, by his name. Zosim. Hist. ii.

      Both Niger and Albinus were discovered and put to death in their
      flight from the field of battle. Their fate excited neither
      surprise nor compassion. They had staked their lives against the
      chance of empire, and suffered what they would have inflicted;
      nor did Severus claim the arrogant superiority of suffering his
      rivals to live in a private station. But his unforgiving temper,
      stimulated by avarice, indulged a spirit of revenge, where there
      was no room for apprehension. The most considerable of the
      provincials, who, without any dislike to the fortunate candidate,
      had obeyed the governor under whose authority they were
      accidentally placed, were punished by death, exile, and
      especially by the confiscation of their estates. Many cities of
      the East were stripped of their ancient honors, and obliged to
      pay, into the treasury of Severus, four times the amount of the
      sums contributed by them for the service of Niger. 56

      56 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxiv. p. 1250.]

      Till the final decision of the war, the cruelty of Severus was,
      in some measure, restrained by the uncertainty of the event, and
      his pretended reverence for the senate. The head of Albinus,
      accompanied with a menacing letter, announced to the Romans that
      he was resolved to spare none of the adherents of his unfortunate
      competitors. He was irritated by the just auspicion that he had
      never possessed the affections of the senate, and he concealed
      his old malevolence under the recent discovery of some
      treasonable correspondences. Thirty-five senators, however,
      accused of having favored the party of Albinus, he freely
      pardoned, and, by his subsequent behavior, endeavored to convince
      them, that he had forgotten, as well as forgiven, their supposed
      offences. But, at the same time, he condemned forty-one 57 other
      senators, whose names history has recorded; their wives,
      children, and clients attended them in death, 571 and the noblest
      provincials of Spain and Gaul were involved in the same ruin. 572
      Such rigid justice—for so he termed it—was, in the opinion of
      Severus, the only conduct capable of insuring peace to the people
      or stability to the prince; and he condescended slightly to
      lament, that to be mild, it was necessary that he should first be
      cruel. 58

      into the Rhone; those of Niger, according to Lampridius, were
      sent into exile, but afterwards put to death. Among the partisans

      detected by overacting their loyalty, Mai. Fragm. Vatican. p. 227

      The true interest of an absolute monarch generally coincides with
      that of his people. Their numbers, their wealth, their order, and
      their security, are the best and only foundations of his real
      greatness; and were he totally devoid of virtue, prudence might
      supply its place, and would dictate the same rule of conduct.
      Severus considered the Roman empire as his property, and had no
      sooner secured the possession, than he bestowed his care on the
      cultivation and improvement of so valuable an acquisition.
      Salutary laws, executed with inflexible firmness, soon corrected
      most of the abuses with which, since the death of Marcus, every
      part of the government had been infected. In the administration
      of justice, the judgments of the emperor were characterized by
      attention, discernment, and impartiality; and whenever he
      deviated from the strict line of equity, it was generally in
      favor of the poor and oppressed; not so much indeed from any
      sense of humanity, as from the natural propensity of a despot to
      humble the pride of greatness, and to sink all his subjects to
      the same common level of absolute dependence. His expensive taste
      for building, magnificent shows, and above all a constant and
      liberal distribution of corn and provisions, were the surest
      means of captivating the affection of the Roman people. 59 The
      misfortunes of civil discord were obliterated. The calm of peace
      and prosperity was once more experienced in the provinces; and
      many cities, restored by the munificence of Severus, assumed the
      title of his colonies, and attested by public monuments their
      gratitude and felicity. 60 The fame of the Roman arms was revived
      by that warlike and successful emperor, 61 and he boasted, with a
      just pride, that, having received the empire oppressed with
      foreign and domestic wars, he left it established in profound,
      universal, and honorable peace. 62

      59 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxvi. p. 1272. Hist. August. p. 67.
      Severus celebrated the secular games with extraordinary
      magnificence, and he left in the public granaries a provision of
      corn for seven years, at the rate of 75,000 modii, or about 2500
      quarters per day. I am persuaded that the granaries of Severus
      were supplied for a long term, but I am not less persuaded, that
      policy on one hand, and admiration on the other, magnified the
      hoard far beyond its true contents.]

      Although the wounds of civil war appeared completely healed, its
      mortal poison still lurked in the vitals of the constitution.
      Severus possessed a considerable share of vigor and ability; but
      the daring soul of the first Cæsar, or the deep policy of
      Augustus, were scarcely equal to the task of curbing the
      insolence of the victorious legions. By gratitude, by misguided
      policy, by seeming necessity, Severus was reduced to relax the
      nerves of discipline. 63 The vanity of his soldiers was flattered
      with the honor of wearing gold rings; their ease was indulged in
      the permission of living with their wives in the idleness of
      quarters. He increased their pay beyond the example of former
      times, and taught them to expect, and soon to claim,
      extraordinary donatives on every public occasion of danger or
      festivity. Elated by success, enervated by luxury, and raised
      above the level of subjects by their dangerous privileges, 64
      they soon became incapable of military fatigue, oppressive to the
      country, and impatient of a just subordination. Their officers
      asserted the superiority of rank by a more profuse and elegant
      luxury. There is still extant a letter of Severus, lamenting the
      licentious stage of the army, 641 and exhorting one of his
      generals to begin the necessary reformation from the tribunes
      themselves; since, as he justly observes, the officer who has
      forfeited the esteem, will never command the obedience, of his
      soldiers. 65 Had the emperor pursued the train of reflection, he
      would have discovered, that the primary cause of this general
      corruption might be ascribed, not indeed to the example, but to
      the pernicious indulgence, however, of the commander-in-chief.

      The Prætorians, who murdered their emperor and sold the empire,
      had received the just punishment of their treason; but the
      necessary, though dangerous, institution of guards was soon
      restored on a new model by Severus, and increased to four times
      the ancient number. 66 Formerly these troops had been recruited
      in Italy; and as the adjacent provinces gradually imbibed the
      softer manners of Rome, the levies were extended to Macedonia,
      Noricum, and Spain. In the room of these elegant troops, better
      adapted to the pomp of courts than to the uses of war, it was
      established by Severus, that from all the legions of the
      frontiers, the soldiers most distinguished for strength, valor,
      and fidelity, should be occasionally draughted; and promoted, as
      an honor and reward, into the more eligible service of the
      guards. 67 By this new institution, the Italian youth were
      diverted from the exercise of arms, and the capital was terrified
      by the strange aspect and manners of a multitude of barbarians.
      But Severus flattered himself, that the legions would consider
      these chosen Prætorians as the representatives of the whole
      military order; and that the present aid of fifty thousand men,
      superior in arms and appointments to any force that could be
      brought into the field against them, would forever crush the
      hopes of rebellion, and secure the empire to himself and his
      posterity.

      The command of these favored and formidable troops soon became
      the first office of the empire. As the government degenerated
      into military despotism, the Prætorian Præfect, who in his origin
      had been a simple captain of the guards, 671 was placed not only
      at the head of the army, but of the finances, and even of the
      law. In every department of administration, he represented the
      person, and exercised the authority, of the emperor. The first
      præfect who enjoyed and abused this immense power was Plautianus,
      the favorite minister of Severus. His reign lasted above ten
      years, till the marriage of his daughter with the eldest son of
      the emperor, which seemed to assure his fortune, proved the
      occasion of his ruin. 68 The animosities of the palace, by
      irritating the ambition and alarming the fears of Plautianus, 681
      threatened to produce a revolution, and obliged the emperor, who
      still loved him, to consent with reluctance to his death. 69
      After the fall of Plautianus, an eminent lawyer, the celebrated
      Papinian, was appointed to execute the motley office of Prætorian
      Præfect.

      671 (return) [ The Prætorian Præfect had never been a simple
      captain of the guards; from the first creation of this office,
      under Augustus, it possessed great power. That emperor,
      therefore, decreed that there should be always two Prætorian
      Præfects, who could only be taken from the equestrian order
      Tiberius first departed from the former clause of this edict;
      Alexander Severus violated the second by naming senators
      præfects. It appears that it was under Commodus that the
      Prætorian Præfects obtained the province of civil jurisdiction.
      It extended only to Italy, with the exception of Rome and its
      district, which was governed by the Præfectus urbi. As to the
      control of the finances, and the levying of taxes, it was not
      intrusted to them till after the great change that Constantine I.
      made in the organization of the empire at least, I know no
      passage which assigns it to them before that time; and
      Drakenborch, who has treated this question in his Dissertation de
      official præfectorum prætorio, vi., does not quote one.—W.]

      68 (return) [ One of his most daring and wanton acts of power,
      was the castration of a hundred free Romans, some of them married
      men, and even fathers of families; merely that his daughter, on
      her marriage with the young emperor, might be attended by a train
      of eunuchs worthy of an eastern queen. Dion, l. lxxvi. p. 1271.]

      681 (return) [ Plautianus was compatriot, relative, and the old
      friend, of Severus; he had so completely shut up all access to
      the emperor, that the latter was ignorant how far he abused his
      powers: at length, being informed of it, he began to limit his
      authority. The marriage of Plautilla with Caracalla was
      unfortunate; and the prince who had been forced to consent to it,
      menaced the father and the daughter with death when he should
      come to the throne. It was feared, after that, that Plautianus
      would avail himself of the power which he still possessed,
      against the Imperial family; and Severus caused him to be
      assassinated in his presence, upon the pretext of a conspiracy,
      which Dion considers fictitious.—W. This note is not, perhaps,
      very necessary and does not contain the whole facts. Dion
      considers the conspiracy the invention of Caracalla, by whose
      command, almost by whose hand, Plautianus was slain in the
      presence of Severus.—M.]

      better acquainted with this mysterious transaction, and more
      assured of the guilt of Plautianus than the Roman senator
      ventures to be.]

      Till the reign of Severus, the virtue and even the good sense of
      the emperors had been distinguished by their zeal or affected
      reverence for the senate, and by a tender regard to the nice
      frame of civil policy instituted by Augustus. But the youth of
      Severus had been trained in the implicit obedience of camps, and
      his riper years spent in the despotism of military command. His
      haughty and inflexible spirit could not discover, or would not
      acknowledge, the advantage of preserving an intermediate power,
      however imaginary, between the emperor and the army. He disdained
      to profess himself the servant of an assembly that detested his
      person and trembled at his frown; he issued his commands, where
      his requests would have proved as effectual; assumed the conduct
      and style of a sovereign and a conqueror, and exercised, without
      disguise, the whole legislative, as well as the executive power.

      The victory over the senate was easy and inglorious. Every eye
      and every passion were directed to the supreme magistrate, who
      possessed the arms and treasure of the state; whilst the senate,
      neither elected by the people, nor guarded by military force, nor
      animated by public spirit, rested its declining authority on the
      frail and crumbling basis of ancient opinion. The fine theory of
      a republic insensibly vanished, and made way for the more natural
      and substantial feelings of monarchy. As the freedom and honors
      of Rome were successively communicated to the provinces, in which
      the old government had been either unknown, or was remembered
      with abhorrence, the tradition of republican maxims was gradually
      obliterated. The Greek historians of the age of the Antonines 70
      observe, with a malicious pleasure, that although the sovereign
      of Rome, in compliance with an obsolete prejudice, abstained from
      the name of king, he possessed the full measure of regal power.
      In the reign of Severus, the senate was filled with polished and
      eloquent slaves from the eastern provinces, who justified
      personal flattery by speculative principles of servitude. These
      new advocates of prerogative were heard with pleasure by the
      court, and with patience by the people, when they inculcated the
      duty of passive obedience, and descanted on the inevitable
      mischiefs of freedom. The lawyers and historians concurred in
      teaching, that the Imperial authority was held, not by the
      delegated commission, but by the irrevocable resignation of the
      senate; that the emperor was freed from the restraint of civil
      laws, could command by his arbitrary will the lives and fortunes
      of his subjects, and might dispose of the empire as of his
      private patrimony. 71 The most eminent of the civil lawyers, and
      particularly Papinian, Paulus, and Ulpian, flourished under the
      house of Severus; and the Roman jurisprudence, having closely
      united itself with the system of monarchy, was supposed to have
      attained its full majority and perfection.

      The contemporaries of Severus in the enjoyment of the peace and
      glory of his reign, forgave the cruelties by which it had been
      introduced. Posterity, who experienced the fatal effects of his
      maxims and example, justly considered him as the principal author
      of the decline of the Roman empire.
