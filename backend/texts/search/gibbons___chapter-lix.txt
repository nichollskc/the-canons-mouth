      In a style less grave than that of history, I should perhaps
      compare the emperor Alexius 1 to the jackal, who is said to
      follow the steps, and to devour the leavings, of the lion.
      Whatever had been his fears and toils in the passage of the first
      crusade, they were amply recompensed by the subsequent benefits
      which he derived from the exploits of the Franks. His dexterity
      and vigilance secured their first conquest of Nice; and from this
      threatening station the Turks were compelled to evacuate the
      neighborhood of Constantinople. While the crusaders, with blind
      valor, advanced into the midland countries of Asia, the crafty
      Greek improved the favorable occasion when the emirs of the
      sea-coast were recalled to the standard of the sultan. The Turks
      were driven from the Isles of Rhodes and Chios: the cities of
      Ephesus and Smyrna, of Sardes, Philadelphia, and Laodicea, were
      restored to the empire, which Alexius enlarged from the
      Hellespont to the banks of the Mæander, and the rocky shores of
      Pamphylia. The churches resumed their splendor: the towns were
      rebuilt and fortified; and the desert country was peopled with
      colonies of Christians, who were gently removed from the more
      distant and dangerous frontier. In these paternal cares, we may
      forgive Alexius, if he forgot the deliverance of the holy
      sepulchre; but, by the Latins, he was stigmatized with the foul
      reproach of treason and desertion. They had sworn fidelity and
      obedience to his throne; but _he_ had promised to assist their
      enterprise in person, or, at least, with his troops and
      treasures: his base retreat dissolved their obligations; and the
      sword, which had been the instrument of their victory, was the
      pledge and title of their just independence. It does not appear
      that the emperor attempted to revive his obsolete claims over the
      kingdom of Jerusalem; 2 but the borders of Cilicia and Syria were
      more recent in his possession, and more accessible to his arms.
      The great army of the crusaders was annihilated or dispersed; the
      principality of Antioch was left without a head, by the surprise
      and captivity of Bohemond; his ransom had oppressed him with a
      heavy debt; and his Norman followers were insufficient to repel
      the hostilities of the Greeks and Turks. In this distress,
      Bohemond embraced a magnanimous resolution, of leaving the
      defence of Antioch to his kinsman, the faithful Tancred; of
      arming the West against the Byzantine empire; and of executing
      the design which he inherited from the lessons and example of his
      father Guiscard. His embarkation was clandestine: and, if we may
      credit a tale of the princess Anne, he passed the hostile sea
      closely secreted in a coffin. 3 But his reception in France was
      dignified by the public applause, and his marriage with the
      king’s daughter: his return was glorious, since the bravest
      spirits of the age enlisted under his veteran command; and he
      repassed the Adriatic at the head of five thousand horse and
      forty thousand foot, assembled from the most remote climates of
      Europe. 4 The strength of Durazzo, and prudence of Alexius, the
      progress of famine and approach of winter, eluded his ambitious
      hopes; and the venal confederates were seduced from his standard.
      A treaty of peace 5 suspended the fears of the Greeks; and they
      were finally delivered by the death of an adversary, whom neither
      oaths could bind, nor dangers could appal, nor prosperity could
      satiate. His children succeeded to the principality of Antioch;
      but the boundaries were strictly defined, the homage was clearly
      stipulated, and the cities of Tarsus and Malmistra were restored
      to the Byzantine emperors. Of the coast of Anatolia, they
      possessed the entire circuit from Trebizond to the Syrian gates.
      The Seljukian dynasty of Roum 6 was separated on all sides from
      the sea and their Mussulman brethren; the power of the sultan was
      shaken by the victories and even the defeats of the Franks; and
      after the loss of Nice, they removed their throne to Cogni or
      Iconium, an obscure and in land town above three hundred miles
      from Constantinople. 7 Instead of trembling for their capital,
      the Comnenian princes waged an offensive war against the Turks,
      and the first crusade prevented the fall of the declining empire.

      nominal dependence, and in the dates of their inscriptions, (one
      is still legible in the church of Bethlem,) they respectfully
      placed before their own the name of the reigning emperor,
      (Ducange, Dissertations sur Joinville xxvii. p. 319.)]

      he was shut up with a dead cock; and condescends to wonder how
      the Barbarian could endure the confinement and putrefaction. This
      absurd tale is unknown to the Latins. * Note: The Greek writers,
      in general, Zonaras, p. 2, 303, and Glycas, p. 334 agree in this
      story with the princess Anne, except in the absurd addition of
      the dead cock. Ducange has already quoted some instances where a
      similar stratagem had been adopted by _Norman_ princes. On this
      authority Wilken inclines to believe the fact. Appendix to vol.

      5 (return) [ The copy of the treaty (Alexiad. l. xiii. p.

      and Arabians. The last are ignorant or regardless of the affairs
      of _Roum_.]

      7 (return) [ Iconium is mentioned as a station by Xenophon, and
      by Strabo, with an ambiguous title of Κωμόπολις, (Cellarius, tom.
      ii. p. 121.) Yet St. Paul found in that place a multitude
      (πλῆθος) of Jews and Gentiles. under the corrupt name of
      _Kunijah_, it is described as a great city, with a river and
      garden, three leagues from the mountains, and decorated (I know
      not why) with Plato’s tomb, (Abulfeda, tabul. xvii. p. 303 vers.
      Reiske; and the Index Geographicus of Schultens from Ibn Said.)]

      In the twelfth century, three great emigrations marched by land
      from the West for the relief of Palestine. The soldiers and
      pilgrims of Lombardy, France, and Germany were excited by the
      example and success of the first crusade. 8 Forty-eight years
      after the deliverance of the holy sepulchre, the emperor, and the
      French king, Conrad the Third and Louis the Seventh, undertook
      the second crusade to support the falling fortunes of the Latins.
      9 A grand division of the third crusade was led by the emperor
      Frederic Barbarossa, 10 who sympathized with his brothers of
      France and England in the common loss of Jerusalem. These three
      expeditions may be compared in their resemblance of the greatness
      of numbers, their passage through the Greek empire, and the
      nature and event of their Turkish warfare, and a brief parallel
      may save the repetition of a tedious narrative. However splendid
      it may seem, a regular story of the crusades would exhibit the
      perpetual return of the same causes and effects; and the frequent
      attempts for the defence or recovery of the Holy Land would
      appear so many faint and unsuccessful copies of the original.

      I. Of the swarms that so closely trod in the footsteps of the
      first pilgrims, the chiefs were equal in rank, though unequal in
      fame and merit, to Godfrey of Bouillon and his
      fellow-adventurers. At their head were displayed the banners of
      the dukes of Burgundy, Bavaria, and Aquitain; the first a
      descendant of Hugh Capet, the second, a father of the Brunswick
      line: the archbishop of Milan, a temporal prince, transported,
      for the benefit of the Turks, the treasures and ornaments of his
      church and palace; and the veteran crusaders, Hugh the Great and
      Stephen of Chartres, returned to consummate their unfinished vow.
      The huge and disorderly bodies of their followers moved forward
      in two columns; and if the first consisted of two hundred and
      sixty thousand persons, the second might possibly amount to sixty
      thousand horse and one hundred thousand foot. 11 111 The armies
      of the second crusade might have claimed the conquest of Asia;
      the nobles of France and Germany were animated by the presence of
      their sovereigns; and both the rank and personal character of
      Conrad and Louis gave a dignity to their cause, and a discipline
      to their force, which might be vainly expected from the feudatory
      chiefs. The cavalry of the emperor, and that of the king, was
      each composed of seventy thousand knights, and their immediate
      attendants in the field; 12 and if the light-armed troops, the
      peasant infantry, the women and children, the priests and monks,
      be rigorously excluded, the full account will scarcely be
      satisfied with four hundred thousand souls. The West, from Rome
      to Britain, was called into action; the kings of Poland and
      Bohemia obeyed the summons of Conrad; and it is affirmed by the
      Greeks and Latins, that, in the passage of a strait or river, the
      Byzantine agents, after a tale of nine hundred thousand, desisted
      from the endless and formidable computation. 13 In the third
      crusade, as the French and English preferred the navigation of
      the Mediterranean, the host of Frederic Barbarossa was less
      numerous. Fifteen thousand knights, and as many squires, were the
      flower of the German chivalry: sixty thousand horse, and one
      hundred thousand foot, were mustered by the emperor in the plains
      of Hungary; and after such repetitions, we shall no longer be
      startled at the six hundred thousand pilgrims, which credulity
      has ascribed to this last emigration. 14 Such extravagant
      reckonings prove only the astonishment of contemporaries; but
      their astonishment most strongly bears testimony to the existence
      of an enormous, though indefinite, multitude. The Greeks might
      applaud their superior knowledge of the arts and stratagems of
      war, but they confessed the strength and courage of the French
      cavalry, and the infantry of the Germans; 15 and the strangers
      are described as an iron race, of gigantic stature, who darted
      fire from their eyes, and spilt blood like water on the ground.
      Under the banners of Conrad, a troop of females rode in the
      attitude and armor of men; and the chief of these Amazons, from
      her gilt spurs and buskins, obtained the epithet of the
      Golden-footed Dame.

      11 (return) [ Anne, who states these later swarms at 40,000 horse
      and 100,000 foot, calls them Normans, and places at their head
      two brothers of Flanders. The Greeks were strangely ignorant of
      the names, families, and possessions of the Latin princes.]

      111 (return) [ It was this army of pilgrims, the first body of
      which was headed by the archbishop of Milan and Count Albert of
      Blandras, which set forth on the wild, yet, with a more
      disciplined army, not impolitic, enterprise of striking at the
      heart of the Mahometan power, by attacking the sultan in Bagdad.
      For their adventures and fate, see Wilken, vol. ii. p. 120, &c.,
      Michaud, book iv.—M.]

      12 (return) [ William of Tyre, and Matthew Paris, reckon 70,000
      loricati in each of the armies.]

      13 (return) [ The imperfect enumeration is mentioned by Cinnamus,
      (ennenhkonta muriadeV,) and confirmed by Odo de Diogilo apud
      Ducange ad Cinnamum, with the more precise sum of 900,556. Why
      must therefore the version and comment suppose the modest and
      insufficient reckoning of 90,000? Does not Godfrey of Viterbo
      (Pantheon, p. xix. in Muratori, tom. vii. p. 462) exclaim?
      ——Numerum si poscere quæras, Millia millena militis agmen erat.]

      14 (return) [ This extravagant account is given by Albert of
      Stade, (apud Struvium, p. 414;) my calculation is borrowed from
      Godfrey of Viterbo, Arnold of Lubeck, apud eundem, and Bernard
      Thesaur. (c. 169, p. 804.) The original writers are silent. The
      Mahometans gave him 200,000, or 260,000, men, (Bohadin, in Vit.
      Saladin, p. 110.)]

      15 (return) [ I must observe, that, in the second and third
      crusades, the subjects of Conrad and Frederic are styled by the
      Greeks and Orientals _Alamanni_. The Lechi and Tzechi of Cinnamus
      are the Poles and Bohemians; and it is for the French that he
      reserves the ancient appellation of Germans. He likewise names
      the Brittioi, or Britannoi. * Note: * He names both—Brittioi te
      kai Britanoi.—M.]

      II. The number and character of the strangers was an object of
      terror to the effeminate Greeks, and the sentiment of fear is
      nearly allied to that of hatred. This aversion was suspended or
      softened by the apprehension of the Turkish power; and the
      invectives of the Latins will not bias our more candid belief,
      that the emperor Alexius dissembled their insolence, eluded their
      hostilities, counselled their rashness, and opened to their ardor
      the road of pilgrimage and conquest. But when the Turks had been
      driven from Nice and the sea-coast, when the Byzantine princes no
      longer dreaded the distant sultans of Cogni, they felt with purer
      indignation the free and frequent passage of the western
      Barbarians, who violated the majesty, and endangered the safety,
      of the empire. The second and third crusades were undertaken
      under the reign of Manuel Comnenus and Isaac Angelus. Of the
      former, the passions were always impetuous, and often malevolent;
      and the natural union of a cowardly and a mischievous temper was
      exemplified in the latter, who, without merit or mercy, could
      punish a tyrant, and occupy his throne. It was secretly, and
      perhaps tacitly, resolved by the prince and people to destroy, or
      at least to discourage, the pilgrims, by every species of injury
      and oppression; and their want of prudence and discipline
      continually afforded the pretence or the opportunity. The Western
      monarchs had stipulated a safe passage and fair market in the
      country of their Christian brethren; the treaty had been ratified
      by oaths and hostages; and the poorest soldier of Frederic’s army
      was furnished with three marks of silver to defray his expenses
      on the road. But every engagement was violated by treachery and
      injustice; and the complaints of the Latins are attested by the
      honest confession of a Greek historian, who has dared to prefer
      truth to his country. 16 Instead of a hospitable reception, the
      gates of the cities, both in Europe and Asia, were closely barred
      against the crusaders; and the scanty pittance of food was let
      down in baskets from the walls. Experience or foresight might
      excuse this timid jealousy; but the common duties of humanity
      prohibited the mixture of chalk, or other poisonous ingredients,
      in the bread; and should Manuel be acquitted of any foul
      connivance, he is guilty of coining base money for the purpose of
      trading with the pilgrims. In every step of their march they were
      stopped or misled: the governors had private orders to fortify
      the passes and break down the bridges against them: the
      stragglers were pillaged and murdered: the soldiers and horses
      were pierced in the woods by arrows from an invisible hand; the
      sick were burnt in their beds; and the dead bodies were hung on
      gibbets along the highways. These injuries exasperated the
      champions of the cross, who were not endowed with evangelical
      patience; and the Byzantine princes, who had provoked the unequal
      conflict, promoted the embarkation and march of these formidable
      guests. On the verge of the Turkish frontier Barbarossa spared
      the guilty Philadelphia, 17 rewarded the hospitable Laodicea, and
      deplored the hard necessity that had stained his sword with any
      drops of Christian blood. In their intercourse with the monarchs
      of Germany and France, the pride of the Greeks was exposed to an
      anxious trial. They might boast that on the first interview the
      seat of Louis was a low stool, beside the throne of Manuel; 18
      but no sooner had the French king transported his army beyond the
      Bosphorus, than he refused the offer of a second conference,
      unless his brother would meet him on equal terms, either on the
      sea or land. With Conrad and Frederic, the ceremonial was still
      nicer and more difficult: like the successors of Constantine,
      they styled themselves emperors of the Romans; 19 and firmly
      maintained the purity of their title and dignity. The first of
      these representatives of Charlemagne would only converse with
      Manuel on horseback in the open field; the second, by passing the
      Hellespont rather than the Bosphorus, declined the view of
      Constantinople and its sovereign. An emperor, who had been
      crowned at Rome, was reduced in the Greek epistles to the humble
      appellation of _Rex_, or prince, of the Alemanni; and the vain
      and feeble Angelus affected to be ignorant of the name of one of
      the greatest men and monarchs of the age. While they viewed with
      hatred and suspicion the Latin pilgrims the Greek emperors
      maintained a strict, though secret, alliance with the Turks and
      Saracens. Isaac Angelus complained, that by his friendship for
      the great Saladin he had incurred the enmity of the Franks; and a
      mosque was founded at Constantinople for the public exercise of
      the religion of Mahomet. 20

      16 (return) [ Nicetas was a child at the second crusade, but in
      the third he commanded against the Franks the important post of
      Philippopolis. Cinnamus is infected with national prejudice and
      pride.]

      17 (return) [ The conduct of the Philadelphians is blamed by
      Nicetas, while the anonymous German accuses the rudeness of his
      countrymen, (culpâ nostrâ.) History would be pleasant, if we were
      embarrassed only by _such_ contradictions. It is likewise from
      Nicetas, that we learn the pious and humane sorrow of Frederic.]

      not ex equo, according to the laughable readings of some MSS.]

      is synonymous to Βασιλεὺς.]

      and the History of Bohadin, (p. 129, 130,) see the views of a
      pope and a cadhi on this _singular_toleration.]

      III. The swarms that followed the first crusade were destroyed in
      Anatolia by famine, pestilence, and the Turkish arrows; and the
      princes only escaped with some squadrons of horse to accomplish
      their lamentable pilgrimage. A just opinion may be formed of
      their knowledge and humanity; of their knowledge, from the design
      of subduing Persia and Chorasan in their way to Jerusalem; 201 of
      their humanity, from the massacre of the Christian people, a
      friendly city, who came out to meet them with palms and crosses
      in their hands. The arms of Conrad and Louis were less cruel and
      imprudent; but the event of the second crusade was still more
      ruinous to Christendom; and the Greek Manuel is accused by his
      own subjects of giving seasonable intelligence to the sultan, and
      treacherous guides to the Latin princes. Instead of crushing the
      common foe, by a double attack at the same time but on different
      sides, the Germans were urged by emulation, and the French were
      retarded by jealousy. Louis had scarcely passed the Bosphorus
      when he was met by the returning emperor, who had lost the
      greater part of his army in glorious, but unsuccessful, actions
      on the banks of the Mæander. The contrast of the pomp of his
      rival hastened the retreat of Conrad: 202 the desertion of his
      independent vassals reduced him to his hereditary troops; and he
      borrowed some Greek vessels to execute by sea the pilgrimage of
      Palestine. Without studying the lessons of experience, or the
      nature of the war, the king of France advanced through the same
      country to a similar fate. The vanguard, which bore the royal
      banner and the oriflamme of St. Denys, 21 had doubled their march
      with rash and inconsiderate speed; and the rear, which the king
      commanded in person, no longer found their companions in the
      evening camp. In darkness and disorder, they were encompassed,
      assaulted, and overwhelmed, by the innumerable host of Turks,
      who, in the art of war, were superior to the Christians of the
      twelfth century. 211 Louis, who climbed a tree in the general
      discomfiture, was saved by his own valor and the ignorance of his
      adversaries; and with the dawn of day he escaped alive, but
      almost alone, to the camp of the vanguard. But instead of
      pursuing his expedition by land, he was rejoiced to shelter the
      relics of his army in the friendly seaport of Satalia. From
      thence he embarked for Antioch; but so penurious was the supply
      of Greek vessels, that they could only afford room for his
      knights and nobles; and the plebeian crowd of infantry was left
      to perish at the foot of the Pamphylian hills. The emperor and
      the king embraced and wept at Jerusalem; their martial trains,
      the remnant of mighty armies, were joined to the Christian powers
      of Syria, and a fruitless siege of Damascus was the final effort
      of the second crusade. Conrad and Louis embarked for Europe with
      the personal fame of piety and courage; but the Orientals had
      braved these potent monarchs of the Franks, with whose names and
      military forces they had been so often threatened. 22 Perhaps
      they had still more to fear from the veteran genius of Frederic
      the First, who in his youth had served in Asia under his uncle
      Conrad. Forty campaigns in Germany and Italy had taught
      Barbarossa to command; and his soldiers, even the princes of the
      empire, were accustomed under his reign to obey. As soon as he
      lost sight of Philadelphia and Laodicea, the last cities of the
      Greek frontier, he plunged into the salt and barren desert, a
      land (says the historian) of horror and tribulation. 23 During
      twenty days, every step of his fainting and sickly march was
      besieged by the innumerable hordes of Turkmans, 24 whose numbers
      and fury seemed after each defeat to multiply and inflame. The
      emperor continued to struggle and to suffer; and such was the
      measure of his calamities, that when he reached the gates of
      Iconium, no more than one thousand knights were able to serve on
      horseback. By a sudden and resolute assault he defeated the
      guards, and stormed the capital of the sultan, 25 who humbly sued
      for pardon and peace. The road was now open, and Frederic
      advanced in a career of triumph, till he was unfortunately
      drowned in a petty torrent of Cilicia. 26 The remainder of his
      Germans was consumed by sickness and desertion: and the emperor’s
      son expired with the greatest part of his Swabian vassals at the
      siege of Acre. Among the Latin heroes, Godfrey of Bouillon and
      Frederic Barbarossa could alone achieve the passage of the Lesser
      Asia; yet even their success was a warning; and in the last and
      most experienced age of the crusades, every nation preferred the
      sea to the toils and perils of an inland expedition. 27

      exception, of the first crusade, (Secreta Fidelium Crucis, l. ii.
      pars ii. c. i. p. 37.)]

      The enthusiasm of the first crusade is a natural and simple
      event, while hope was fresh, danger untried, and enterprise
      congenial to the spirit of the times. But the obstinate
      perseverance of Europe may indeed excite our pity and admiration;
      that no instruction should have been drawn from constant and
      adverse experience; that the same confidence should have
      repeatedly grown from the same failures; that six succeeding
      generations should have rushed headlong down the precipice that
      was open before them; and that men of every condition should have
      staked their public and private fortunes on the desperate
      adventure of possessing or recovering a tombstone two thousand
      miles from their country. In a period of two centuries after the
      council of Clermont, each spring and summer produced a new
      emigration of pilgrim warriors for the defence of the Holy Land;
      but the seven great armaments or crusades were excited by some
      impending or recent calamity: the nations were moved by the
      authority of their pontiffs, and the example of their kings:
      their zeal was kindled, and their reason was silenced, by the
      voice of their holy orators; and among these, Bernard, 28 the
      monk, or the saint, may claim the most honorable place. 281 About
      eight years before the first conquest of Jerusalem, he was born
      of a noble family in Burgundy; at the age of three-and-twenty he
      buried himself in the monastery of Citeaux, then in the primitive
      fervor of the institution; at the end of two years he led forth
      her third colony, or daughter, to the valley of Clairvaux 29 in
      Champagne; and was content, till the hour of his death, with the
      humble station of abbot of his own community. A philosophic age
      has abolished, with too liberal and indiscriminate disdain, the
      honors of these spiritual heroes. The meanest among them are
      distinguished by some energies of the mind; they were at least
      superior to their votaries and disciples; and, in the race of
      superstition, they attained the prize for which such numbers
      contended. In speech, in writing, in action, Bernard stood high
      above his rivals and contemporaries; his compositions are not
      devoid of wit and eloquence; and he seems to have preserved as
      much reason and humanity as may be reconciled with the character
      of a saint. In a secular life, he would have shared the seventh
      part of a private inheritance; by a vow of poverty and penance,
      by closing his eyes against the visible world, 30 by the refusal
      of all ecclesiastical dignities, the abbot of Clairvaux became
      the oracle of Europe, and the founder of one hundred and sixty
      convents. Princes and pontiffs trembled at the freedom of his
      apostolical censures: France, England, and Milan, consulted and
      obeyed his judgment in a schism of the church: the debt was
      repaid by the gratitude of Innocent the Second; and his
      successor, Eugenius the Third, was the friend and disciple of the
      holy Bernard. It was in the proclamation of the second crusade
      that he shone as the missionary and prophet of God, who called
      the nations to the defence of his holy sepulchre. 31 At the
      parliament of Vezelay he spoke before the king; and Louis the
      Seventh, with his nobles, received their crosses from his hand.
      The abbot of Clairvaux then marched to the less easy conquest of
      the emperor Conrad: 311 a phlegmatic people, ignorant of his
      language, was transported by the pathetic vehemence of his tone
      and gestures; and his progress, from Constance to Cologne, was
      the triumph of eloquence and zeal. Bernard applauds his own
      success in the depopulation of Europe; affirms that cities and
      castles were emptied of their inhabitants; and computes, that
      only one man was left behind for the consolation of seven widows.
      32 The blind fanatics were desirous of electing him for their
      general; but the example of the hermit Peter was before his eyes;
      and while he assured the crusaders of the divine favor, he
      prudently declined a military command, in which failure and
      victory would have been almost equally disgraceful to his
      character. 33 Yet, after the calamitous event, the abbot of
      Clairvaux was loudly accused as a false prophet, the author of
      the public and private mourning; his enemies exulted, his friends
      blushed, and his apology was slow and unsatisfactory. He
      justifies his obedience to the commands of the pope; expatiates
      on the mysterious ways of Providence; imputes the misfortunes of
      the pilgrims to their own sins; and modestly insinuates, that his
      mission had been approved by signs and wonders. 34 Had the fact
      been certain, the argument would be decisive; and his faithful
      disciples, who enumerate twenty or thirty miracles in a day,
      appeal to the public assemblies of France and Germany, in which
      they were performed. 35 At the present hour, such prodigies will
      not obtain credit beyond the precincts of Clairvaux; but in the
      preternatural cures of the blind, the lame, and the sick, who
      were presented to the man of God, it is impossible for us to
      ascertain the separate shares of accident, of fancy, of
      imposture, and of fiction.

      Omnipotence itself cannot escape the murmurs of its discordant
      votaries; since the same dispensation which was applauded as a
      deliverance in Europe, was deplored, and perhaps arraigned, as a
      calamity in Asia. After the loss of Jerusalem, the Syrian
      fugitives diffused their consternation and sorrow; Bagdad mourned
      in the dust; the cadhi Zeineddin of Damascus tore his beard in
      the caliph’s presence; and the whole divan shed tears at his
      melancholy tale. 36 But the commanders of the faithful could only
      weep; they were themselves captives in the hands of the Turks:
      some temporal power was restored to the last age of the
      Abbassides; but their humble ambition was confined to Bagdad and
      the adjacent province. Their tyrants, the Seljukian sultans, had
      followed the common law of the Asiatic dynasties, the unceasing
      round of valor, greatness, discord, degeneracy, and decay; their
      spirit and power were unequal to the defence of religion; and, in
      his distant realm of Persia, the Christians were strangers to the
      name and the arms of Sangiar, the last hero of his race. 37 While
      the sultans were involved in the silken web of the harem, the
      pious task was undertaken by their slaves, the Atabeks, 38 a
      Turkish name, which, like the Byzantine patricians, may be
      translated by Father of the Prince. Ascansar, a valiant Turk, had
      been the favorite of Malek Shaw, from whom he received the
      privilege of standing on the right hand of the throne; but, in
      the civil wars that ensued on the monarch’s death, he lost his
      head and the government of Aleppo. His domestic emirs persevered
      in their attachment to his son Zenghi, who proved his first arms
      against the Franks in the defeat of Antioch: thirty campaigns in
      the service of the caliph and sultan established his military
      fame; and he was invested with the command of Mosul, as the only
      champion that could avenge the cause of the prophet. The public
      hope was not disappointed: after a siege of twenty-five days, he
      stormed the city of Edessa, and recovered from the Franks their
      conquests beyond the Euphrates: 39 the martial tribes of
      Curdistan were subdued by the independent sovereign of Mosul and
      Aleppo: his soldiers were taught to behold the camp as their only
      country; they trusted to his liberality for their rewards; and
      their absent families were protected by the vigilance of Zenghi.
      At the head of these veterans, his son Noureddin gradually united
      the Mahometan powers; 391 added the kingdom of Damascus to that
      of Aleppo, and waged a long and successful war against the
      Christians of Syria; he spread his ample reign from the Tigris to
      the Nile, and the Abbassides rewarded their faithful servant with
      all the titles and prerogatives of royalty. The Latins themselves
      were compelled to own the wisdom and courage, and even the
      justice and piety, of this implacable adversary. 40 In his life
      and government the holy warrior revived the zeal and simplicity
      of the first caliphs. Gold and silk were banished from his
      palace; the use of wine from his dominions; the public revenue
      was scrupulously applied to the public service; and the frugal
      household of Noureddin was maintained from his legitimate share
      of the spoil which he vested in the purchase of a private estate.
      His favorite sultana sighed for some female object of expense.
      “Alas,” replied the king, “I fear God, and am no more than the
      treasurer of the Moslems. Their property I cannot alienate; but I
      still possess three shops in the city of Hems: these you may
      take; and these alone can I bestow.” His chamber of justice was
      the terror of the great and the refuge of the poor. Some years
      after the sultan’s death, an oppressed subject called aloud in
      the streets of Damascus, “O Noureddin, Noureddin, where art thou
      now? Arise, arise, to pity and protect us!” A tumult was
      apprehended, and a living tyrant blushed or trembled at the name
      of a departed monarch.

      Chapter LIX: The Crusades.—Part II.

      By the arms of the Turks and Franks, the Fatimites had been
      deprived of Syria. In Egypt the decay of their character and
      influence was still more essential. Yet they were still revered
      as the descendants and successors of the prophet; they maintained
      their invisible state in the palace of Cairo; and their person
      was seldom violated by the profane eyes of subjects or strangers.
      The Latin ambassadors 41 have described their own introduction,
      through a series of gloomy passages, and glittering porticos: the
      scene was enlivened by the warbling of birds and the murmur of
      fountains: it was enriched by a display of rich furniture and
      rare animals; of the Imperial treasures, something was shown, and
      much was supposed; and the long order of unfolding doors was
      guarded by black soldiers and domestic eunuchs. The sanctuary of
      the presence chamber was veiled with a curtain; and the vizier,
      who conducted the ambassadors, laid aside the cimeter, and
      prostrated himself three times on the ground; the veil was then
      removed; and they beheld the commander of the faithful, who
      signified his pleasure to the first slave of the throne. But this
      slave was his master: the viziers or sultans had usurped the
      supreme administration of Egypt; the claims of the rival
      candidates were decided by arms; and the name of the most worthy,
      of the strongest, was inserted in the royal patent of command.
      The factions of Dargham and Shawer alternately expelled each
      other from the capital and country; and the weaker side implored
      the dangerous protection of the sultan of Damascus, or the king
      of Jerusalem, the perpetual enemies of the sect and monarchy of
      the Fatimites. By his arms and religion the Turk was most
      formidable; but the Frank, in an easy, direct march, could
      advance from Gaza to the Nile; while the intermediate situation
      of his realm compelled the troops of Noureddin to wheel round the
      skirts of Arabia, a long and painful circuit, which exposed them
      to thirst, fatigue, and the burning winds of the desert. The
      secret zeal and ambition of the Turkish prince aspired to reign
      in Egypt under the name of the Abbassides; but the restoration of
      the suppliant Shawer was the ostensible motive of the first
      expedition; and the success was intrusted to the emir Shiracouh,
      a valiant and veteran commander. Dargham was oppressed and slain;
      but the ingratitude, the jealousy, the just apprehensions, of his
      more fortunate rival, soon provoked him to invite the king of
      Jerusalem to deliver Egypt from his insolent benefactors. To this
      union the forces of Shiracouh were unequal: he relinquished the
      premature conquest; and the evacuation of Belbeis or Pelusium was
      the condition of his safe retreat. As the Turks defiled before
      the enemy, and their general closed the rear, with a vigilant
      eye, and a battle axe in his hand, a Frank presumed to ask him if
      he were not afraid of an attack. “It is doubtless in your power
      to begin the attack,” replied the intrepid emir; “but rest
      assured, that not one of my soldiers will go to paradise till he
      has sent an infidel to hell.” His report of the riches of the
      land, the effeminacy of the natives, and the disorders of the
      government, revived the hopes of Noureddin; the caliph of Bagdad
      applauded the pious design; and Shiracouh descended into Egypt a
      second time with twelve thousand Turks and eleven thousand Arabs.
      Yet his forces were still inferior to the confederate armies of
      the Franks and Saracens; and I can discern an unusual degree of
      military art, in his passage of the Nile, his retreat into
      Thebais, his masterly evolutions in the battle of Babain, the
      surprise of Alexandria, and his marches and countermarches in the
      flats and valley of Egypt, from the tropic to the sea. His
      conduct was seconded by the courage of his troops, and on the eve
      of action a Mamaluke 42 exclaimed, “If we cannot wrest Egypt from
      the Christian dogs, why do we not renounce the honors and rewards
      of the sultan, and retire to labor with the peasants, or to spin
      with the females of the harem?” Yet, after all his efforts in the
      field, 43 after the obstinate defence of Alexandria 44 by his
      nephew Saladin, an honorable capitulation and retreat 441
      concluded the second enterprise of Shiracouh; and Noureddin
      reserved his abilities for a third and more propitious occasion.
      It was soon offered by the ambition and avarice of Amalric or
      Amaury, king of Jerusalem, who had imbibed the pernicious maxim,
      that no faith should be kept with the enemies of God. 442 A
      religious warrior, the great master of the hospital, encouraged
      him to proceed; the emperor of Constantinople either gave, or
      promised, a fleet to act with the armies of Syria; and the
      perfidious Christian, unsatisfied with spoil and subsidy, aspired
      to the conquest of Egypt. In this emergency, the Moslems turned
      their eyes towards the sultan of Damascus; the vizier, whom
      danger encompassed on all sides, yielded to their unanimous
      wishes, and Noureddin seemed to be tempted by the fair offer of
      one third of the revenue of the kingdom. The Franks were already
      at the gates of Cairo; but the suburbs, the old city, were burnt
      on their approach; they were deceived by an insidious
      negotiation, and their vessels were unable to surmount the
      barriers of the Nile. They prudently declined a contest with the
      Turks in the midst of a hostile country; and Amaury retired into
      Palestine with the shame and reproach that always adhere to
      unsuccessful injustice. After this deliverance, Shiracouh was
      invested with a robe of honor, which he soon stained with the
      blood of the unfortunate Shawer. For a while, the Turkish emirs
      condescended to hold the office of vizier; but this foreign
      conquest precipitated the fall of the Fatimites themselves; and
      the bloodless change was accomplished by a message and a word.
      The caliphs had been degraded by their own weakness and the
      tyranny of the viziers: their subjects blushed, when the
      descendant and successor of the prophet presented his naked hand
      to the rude gripe of a Latin ambassador; they wept when he sent
      the hair of his women, a sad emblem of their grief and terror, to
      excite the pity of the sultan of Damascus. By the command of
      Noureddin, and the sentence of the doctors, the holy names of
      Abubeker, Omar, and Othman, were solemnly restored: the caliph
      Mosthadi, of Bagdad, was acknowledged in the public prayers as
      the true commander of the faithful; and the green livery of the
      sons of Ali was exchanged for the black color of the Abbassides.
      The last of his race, the caliph Adhed, who survived only ten
      days, expired in happy ignorance of his fate; his treasures
      secured the loyalty of the soldiers, and silenced the murmurs of
      the sectaries; and in all subsequent revolutions, Egypt has never
      departed from the orthodox tradition of the Moslems. 45

      The hilly country beyond the Tigris is occupied by the pastoral
      tribes of the Curds; 46 a people hardy, strong, savage impatient
      of the yoke, addicted to rapine, and tenacious of the government
      of their national chiefs. The resemblance of name, situation, and
      manners, seems to identify them with the Carduchians of the
      Greeks; 47 and they still defend against the Ottoman Porte the
      antique freedom which they asserted against the successors of
      Cyrus. Poverty and ambition prompted them to embrace the
      profession of mercenary soldiers: the service of his father and
      uncle prepared the reign of the great Saladin; 48 and the son of
      Job or Ayud, a simple Curd, magnanimously smiled at his
      pedigree, which flattery deduced from the Arabian caliphs. 49 So
      unconscious was Noureddin of the impending ruin of his house,
      that he constrained the reluctant youth to follow his uncle
      Shiracouh into Egypt: his military character was established by
      the defence of Alexandria; and, if we may believe the Latins, he
      solicited and obtained from the Christian general the
      _profane_honors of knighthood. 50 On the death of Shiracouh, the
      office of grand vizier was bestowed on Saladin, as the youngest
      and least powerful of the emirs; but with the advice of his
      father, whom he invited to Cairo, his genius obtained the
      ascendant over his equals, and attached the army to his person
      and interest. While Noureddin lived, these ambitious Curds were
      the most humble of his slaves; and the indiscreet murmurs of the
      divan were silenced by the prudent Ayub, who loudly protested
      that at the command of the sultan he himself would lead his sons
      in chains to the foot of the throne. “Such language,” he added in
      private, “was prudent and proper in an assembly of your rivals;
      but we are now above fear and obedience; and the threats of
      Noureddin shall not extort the tribute of a sugar-cane.” His
      seasonable death relieved them from the odious and doubtful
      conflict: his son, a minor of eleven years of age, was left for a
      while to the emirs of Damascus; and the new lord of Egypt was
      decorated by the caliph with every title 51 that could sanctify
      his usurpation in the eyes of the people. Nor was Saladin long
      content with the possession of Egypt; he despoiled the Christians
      of Jerusalem, and the Atabeks of Damascus, Aleppo, and Diarbekir:
      Mecca and Medina acknowledged him for their temporal protector:
      his brother subdued the distant regions of Yemen, or the happy
      Arabia; and at the hour of his death, his empire was spread from
      the African Tripoli to the Tigris, and from the Indian Ocean to
      the mountains of Armenia. In the judgment of his character, the
      reproaches of treason and ingratitude strike forcibly on _our_
      minds, impressed, as they are, with the principle and experience
      of law and loyalty. But his ambition may in some measure be
      excused by the revolutions of Asia, 52 which had erased every
      notion of legitimate succession; by the recent example of the
      Atabeks themselves; by his reverence to the son of his
      benefactor; his humane and generous behavior to the collateral
      branches; by _their_ incapacity and _his_ merit; by the
      approbation of the caliph, the sole source of all legitimate
      power; and, above all, by the wishes and interest of the people,
      whose happiness is the first object of government. In _his_
      virtues, and in those of his patron, they admired the singular
      union of the hero and the saint; for both Noureddin and Saladin
      are ranked among the Mahometan saints; and the constant
      meditation of the holy war appears to have shed a serious and
      sober color over their lives and actions. The youth of the latter
      53 was addicted to wine and women: but his aspiring spirit soon
      renounced the temptations of pleasure for the graver follies of
      fame and dominion: the garment of Saladin was of coarse woollen;
      water was his only drink; and, while he emulated the temperance,
      he surpassed the chastity, of his Arabian prophet. Both in faith
      and practice he was a rigid Mussulman: he ever deplored that the
      defence of religion had not allowed him to accomplish the
      pilgrimage of Mecca; but at the stated hours, five times each
      day, the sultan devoutly prayed with his brethren: the
      involuntary omission of fasting was scrupulously repaid; and his
      perusal of the Koran, on horseback between the approaching
      armies, may be quoted as a proof, however ostentatious, of piety
      and courage. 54 The superstitious doctrine of the sect of Shafei
      was the only study that he deigned to encourage: the poets were
      safe in his contempt; but all profane science was the object of
      his aversion; and a philosopher, who had invented some
      speculative novelties, was seized and strangled by the command of
      the royal saint. The justice of his divan was accessible to the
      meanest suppliant against himself and his ministers; and it was
      only for a kingdom that Saladin would deviate from the rule of
      equity. While the descendants of Seljuk and Zenghi held his
      stirrup and smoothed his garments, he was affable and patient
      with the meanest of his servants. So boundless was his
      liberality, that he distributed twelve thousand horses at the
      siege of Acre; and, at the time of his death, no more than
      forty-seven drams of silver and one piece of gold coin were found
      in the treasury; yet, in a martial reign, the tributes were
      diminished, and the wealthy citizens enjoyed, without fear or
      danger, the fruits of their industry. Egypt, Syria, and Arabia,
      were adorned by the royal foundations of hospitals, colleges, and
      mosques; and Cairo was fortified with a wall and citadel; but his
      works were consecrated to public use: 55 nor did the sultan
      indulge himself in a garden or palace of private luxury. In a
      fanatic age, himself a fanatic, the genuine virtues of Saladin
      commanded the esteem of the Christians; the emperor of Germany
      gloried in his friendship; 56 the Greek emperor solicited his
      alliance; 57 and the conquest of Jerusalem diffused, and perhaps
      magnified, his fame both in the East and West.

      During its short existence, the kingdom of Jerusalem 58 was
      supported by the discord of the Turks and Saracens; and both the
      Fatimite caliphs and the sultans of Damascus were tempted to
      sacrifice the cause of their religion to the meaner
      considerations of private and present advantage. But the powers
      of Egypt, Syria, and Arabia, were now united by a hero, whom
      nature and fortune had armed against the Christians. All without
      now bore the most threatening aspect; and all was feeble and
      hollow in the internal state of Jerusalem. After the two first
      Baldwins, the brother and cousin of Godfrey of Bouillon, the
      sceptre devolved by female succession to Melisenda, daughter of
      the second Baldwin, and her husband Fulk, count of Anjou, the
      father, by a former marriage, of our English Plantagenets. Their
      two sons, Baldwin the Third, and Amaury, waged a strenuous, and
      not unsuccessful, war against the infidels; but the son of
      Amaury, Baldwin the Fourth, was deprived, by the leprosy, a gift
      of the crusades, of the faculties both of mind and body. His
      sister Sybilla, the mother of Baldwin the Fifth, was his natural
      heiress: after the suspicious death of her child, she crowned her
      second husband, Guy of Lusignan, a prince of a handsome person,
      but of such base renown, that his own brother Jeffrey was heard
      to exclaim, “Since they have made _him_ a king, surely they would
      have made _me_ a god!” The choice was generally blamed; and the
      most powerful vassal, Raymond count of Tripoli, who had been
      excluded from the succession and regency, entertained an
      implacable hatred against the king, and exposed his honor and
      conscience to the temptations of the sultan. Such were the
      guardians of the holy city; a leper, a child, a woman, a coward,
      and a traitor: yet its fate was delayed twelve years by some
      supplies from Europe, by the valor of the military orders, and by
      the distant or domestic avocations of their great enemy. At
      length, on every side, the sinking state was encircled and
      pressed by a hostile line: and the truce was violated by the
      Franks, whose existence it protected. A soldier of fortune,
      Reginald of Chatillon, had seized a fortress on the edge of the
      desert, from whence he pillaged the caravans, insulted Mahomet,
      and threatened the cities of Mecca and Medina. Saladin
      condescended to complain; rejoiced in the denial of justice, and
      at the head of fourscore thousand horse and foot invaded the Holy
      Land. The choice of Tiberias for his first siege was suggested by
      the count of Tripoli, to whom it belonged; and the king of
      Jerusalem was persuaded to drain his garrison, and to arm his
      people, for the relief of that important place. 59 By the advice
      of the perfidious Raymond, the Christians were betrayed into a
      camp destitute of water: he fled on the first onset, with the
      curses of both nations: 60 Lusignan was overthrown, with the loss
      of thirty thousand men; and the wood of the true cross (a dire
      misfortune!) was left in the power of the infidels. 601 The royal
      captive was conducted to the tent of Saladin; and as he fainted
      with thirst and terror, the generous victor presented him with a
      cup of sherbet, cooled in snow, without suffering his companion,
      Reginald of Chatillon, to partake of this pledge of hospitality
      and pardon. “The person and dignity of a king,” said the sultan,
      “are sacred, but this impious robber must instantly acknowledge
      the prophet, whom he has blasphemed, or meet the death which he
      has so often deserved.” On the proud or conscientious refusal of
      the Christian warrior, Saladin struck him on the head with his
      cimeter, and Reginald was despatched by the guards. 61 The
      trembling Lusignan was sent to Damascus, to an honorable prison
      and speedy ransom; but the victory was stained by the execution
      of two hundred and thirty knights of the hospital, the intrepid
      champions and martyrs of their faith. The kingdom was left
      without a head; and of the two grand masters of the military
      orders, the one was slain and the other was a prisoner. From all
      the cities, both of the sea-coast and the inland country, the
      garrisons had been drawn away for this fatal field: Tyre and
      Tripoli alone could escape the rapid inroad of Saladin; and three
      months after the battle of Tiberias, he appeared in arms before
      the gates of Jerusalem. 62

      601 (return) [ Raymond’s advice would have prevented the
      abandonment of a secure camp abounding with water near Sepphoris.
      The rash and insolent valor of the master of the order of Knights
      Templars, which had before exposed the Christians to a fatal
      defeat at the brook Kishon, forced the feeble king to annul the
      determination of a council of war, and advance to a camp in an
      enclosed valley among the mountains, near Hittin, without water.
      Raymond did not fly till the battle was irretrievably lost, and
      then the Saracens seem to have opened their ranks to allow him
      free passage. The charge of suggesting the siege of Tiberias
      appears ungrounded Raymond, no doubt, played a double part: he
      was a man of strong sagacity, who foresaw the desperate nature of
      the contest with Saladin, endeavored by every means to maintain
      the treaty, and, though he joined both his arms and his still
      more valuable counsels to the Christian army, yet kept up a kind
      of amicable correspondence with the Mahometans. See Wilken, vol.
      iii. part ii. p. 276, et seq. Michaud, vol. ii. p. 278, et seq.
      M. Michaud is still more friendly than Wilken to the memory of
      Count Raymond, who died suddenly, shortly after the battle of
      Hittin. He quotes a letter written in the name of Saladin by the
      caliph Alfdel, to show that Raymond was considered by the
      Mahometans their most dangerous and detested enemy. “No person of
      distinction among the Christians escaped, except the count, (of
      Tripoli) whom God curse. God made him die shortly afterwards, and
      sent him from the kingdom of death to hell.”—M.]

      prisoner who had tasted his bread and salt. Some of the
      companions of Arnold had been slaughtered, and almost sacrificed,

      He might expect that the siege of a city so venerable on earth
      and in heaven, so interesting to Europe and Asia, would rekindle
      the last sparks of enthusiasm; and that, of sixty thousand
      Christians, every man would be a soldier, and every soldier a
      candidate for martyrdom. But Queen Sybilla trembled for herself
      and her captive husband; and the barons and knights, who had
      escaped from the sword and chains of the Turks, displayed the
      same factious and selfish spirit in the public ruin. The most
      numerous portion of the inhabitants was composed of the Greek and
      Oriental Christians, whom experience had taught to prefer the
      Mahometan before the Latin yoke; 63 and the holy sepulchre
      attracted a base and needy crowd, without arms or courage, who
      subsisted only on the charity of the pilgrims. Some feeble and
      hasty efforts were made for the defence of Jerusalem: but in the
      space of fourteen days, a victorious army drove back the sallies
      of the besieged, planted their engines, opened the wall to the
      breadth of fifteen cubits, applied their scaling-ladders, and
      erected on the breach twelve banners of the prophet and the
      sultan. It was in vain that a barefoot procession of the queen,
      the women, and the monks, implored the Son of God to save his
      tomb and his inheritance from impious violation. Their sole hope
      was in the mercy of the conqueror, and to their first suppliant
      deputation that mercy was sternly denied. “He had sworn to avenge
      the patience and long-suffering of the Moslems; the hour of
      forgiveness was elapsed, and the moment was now arrived to
      expiate, in blood, the innocent blood which had been spilt by
      Godfrey and the first crusaders.” But a desperate and successful
      struggle of the Franks admonished the sultan that his triumph was
      not yet secure; he listened with reverence to a solemn adjuration
      in the name of the common Father of mankind; and a sentiment of
      human sympathy mollified the rigor of fanaticism and conquest. He
      consented to accept the city, and to spare the inhabitants. The
      Greek and Oriental Christians were permitted to live under his
      dominion, but it was stipulated, that in forty days all the
      Franks and Latins should evacuate Jerusalem, and be safely
      conducted to the seaports of Syria and Egypt; that ten pieces of
      gold should be paid for each man, five for each woman, and one
      for every child; and that those who were unable to purchase their
      freedom should be detained in perpetual slavery. Of some writers
      it is a favorite and invidious theme to compare the humanity of
      Saladin with the massacre of the first crusade. The difference
      would be merely personal; but we should not forget that the
      Christians had offered to capitulate, and that the Mahometans of
      Jerusalem sustained the last extremities of an assault and storm.
      Justice is indeed due to the fidelity with which the Turkish
      conqueror fulfilled the conditions of the treaty; and he may be
      deservedly praised for the glance of pity which he cast on the
      misery of the vanquished. Instead of a rigorous exaction of his
      debt, he accepted a sum of thirty thousand byzants, for the
      ransom of seven thousand poor; two or three thousand more were
      dismissed by his gratuitous clemency; and the number of slaves
      was reduced to eleven or fourteen thousand persons. In this
      interview with the queen, his words, and even his tears suggested
      the kindest consolations; his liberal alms were distributed among
      those who had been made orphans or widows by the fortune of war;
      and while the knights of the hospital were in arms against him,
      he allowed their more pious brethren to continue, during the term
      of a year, the care and service of the sick. In these acts of
      mercy the virtue of Saladin deserves our admiration and love: he
      was above the necessity of dissimulation, and his stern
      fanaticism would have prompted him to dissemble, rather than to
      affect, this profane compassion for the enemies of the Koran.
      After Jerusalem had been delivered from the presence of the
      strangers, the sultan made his triumphal entry, his banners
      waving in the wind, and to the harmony of martial music. The
      great mosque of Omar, which had been converted into a church, was
      again consecrated to one God and his prophet Mahomet: the walls
      and pavement were purified with rose-water; and a pulpit, the
      labor of Noureddin, was erected in the sanctuary. But when the
      golden cross that glittered on the dome was cast down, and
      dragged through the streets, the Christians of every sect uttered
      a lamentable groan, which was answered by the joyful shouts of
      the Moslems. In four ivory chests the patriarch had collected the
      crosses, the images, the vases, and the relics of the holy place;
      they were seized by the conqueror, who was desirous of presenting
      the caliph with the trophies of Christian idolatry. He was
      persuaded, however, to intrust them to the patriarch and prince
      of Antioch; and the pious pledge was redeemed by Richard of
      England, at the expense of fifty-two thousand byzants of gold. 64

      The nations might fear and hope the immediate and final expulsion
      of the Latins from Syria; which was yet delayed above a century
      after the death of Saladin. 65 In the career of victory, he was
      first checked by the resistance of Tyre; the troops and
      garrisons, which had capitulated, were imprudently conducted to
      the same port: their numbers were adequate to the defence of the
      place; and the arrival of Conrad of Montferrat inspired the
      disorderly crowd with confidence and union. His father, a
      venerable pilgrim, had been made prisoner in the battle of
      Tiberias; but that disaster was unknown in Italy and Greece, when
      the son was urged by ambition and piety to visit the inheritance
      of his royal nephew, the infant Baldwin. The view of the Turkish
      banners warned him from the hostile coast of Jaffa; and Conrad
      was unanimously hailed as the prince and champion of Tyre, which
      was already besieged by the conqueror of Jerusalem. The firmness
      of his zeal, and perhaps his knowledge of a generous foe, enabled
      him to brave the threats of the sultan, and to declare, that
      should his aged parent be exposed before the walls, he himself
      would discharge the first arrow, and glory in his descent from a
      Christian martyr. 66 The Egyptian fleet was allowed to enter the
      harbor of Tyre; but the chain was suddenly drawn, and five
      galleys were either sunk or taken: a thousand Turks were slain in
      a sally; and Saladin, after burning his engines, concluded a
      glorious campaign by a disgraceful retreat to Damascus. He was
      soon assailed by a more formidable tempest. The pathetic
      narratives, and even the pictures, that represented in lively
      colors the servitude and profanation of Jerusalem, awakened the
      torpid sensibility of Europe: the emperor Frederic Barbarossa,
      and the kings of France and England, assumed the cross; and the
      tardy magnitude of their armaments was anticipated by the
      maritime states of the Mediterranean and the Ocean. The skilful
      and provident Italians first embarked in the ships of Genoa,
      Pisa, and Venice. They were speedily followed by the most eager
      pilgrims of France, Normandy, and the Western Isles. The powerful
      succor of Flanders, Frise, and Denmark, filled near a hundred
      vessels: and the Northern warriors were distinguished in the
      field by a lofty stature and a ponderous battle-axe. 67 Their
      increasing multitudes could no longer be confined within the
      walls of Tyre, or remain obedient to the voice of Conrad. They
      pitied the misfortunes, and revered the dignity, of Lusignan, who
      was released from prison, perhaps, to divide the army of the
      Franks. He proposed the recovery of Ptolemais, or Acre, thirty
      miles to the south of Tyre; and the place was first invested by
      two thousand horse and thirty thousand foot under his nominal
      command. I shall not expatiate on the story of this memorable
      siege; which lasted near two years, and consumed, in a narrow
      space, the forces of Europe and Asia. Never did the flame of
      enthusiasm burn with fiercer and more destructive rage; nor could
      the true believers, a common appellation, who consecrated their
      own martyrs, refuse some applause to the mistaken zeal and
      courage of their adversaries. At the sound of the holy trumpet,
      the Moslems of Egypt, Syria, Arabia, and the Oriental provinces,
      assembled under the servant of the prophet: 68 his camp was
      pitched and removed within a few miles of Acre; and he labored,
      night and day, for the relief of his brethren and the annoyance
      of the Franks. Nine battles, not unworthy of the name, were
      fought in the neighborhood of Mount Carmel, with such vicissitude
      of fortune, that in one attack, the sultan forced his way into
      the city; that in one sally, the Christians penetrated to the
      royal tent. By the means of divers and pigeons, a regular
      correspondence was maintained with the besieged; and, as often as
      the sea was left open, the exhausted garrison was withdrawn, and
      a fresh supply was poured into the place. The Latin camp was
      thinned by famine, the sword and the climate; but the tents of
      the dead were replenished with new pilgrims, who exaggerated the
      strength and speed of their approaching countrymen. The vulgar
      was astonished by the report, that the pope himself, with an
      innumerable crusade, was advanced as far as Constantinople. The
      march of the emperor filled the East with more serious alarms:
      the obstacles which he encountered in Asia, and perhaps in
      Greece, were raised by the policy of Saladin: his joy on the
      death of Barbarossa was measured by his esteem; and the
      Christians were rather dismayed than encouraged at the sight of
      the duke of Swabia and his way-worn remnant of five thousand
      Germans. At length, in the spring of the second year, the royal
      fleets of France and England cast anchor in the Bay of Acre, and
      the siege was more vigorously prosecuted by the youthful
      emulation of the two kings, Philip Augustus and Richard
      Plantagenet. After every resource had been tried, and every hope
      was exhausted, the defenders of Acre submitted to their fate; a
      capitulation was granted, but their lives and liberties were
      taxed at the hard conditions of a ransom of two hundred thousand
      pieces of gold, the deliverance of one hundred nobles, and
      fifteen hundred inferior captives, and the restoration of the
      wood of the holy cross. Some doubts in the agreement, and some
      delay in the execution, rekindled the fury of the Franks, and
      three thousand Moslems, almost in the sultan’s view, were
      beheaded by the command of the sanguinary Richard. 69 By the
      conquest of Acre, the Latin powers acquired a strong town and a
      convenient harbor; but the advantage was most dearly purchased.
      The minister and historian of Saladin computes, from the report
      of the enemy, that their numbers, at different periods, amounted
      to five or six hundred thousand; that more than one hundred
      thousand Christians were slain; that a far greater number was
      lost by disease or shipwreck; and that a small portion of this
      mighty host could return in safety to their native countries. 70

      Chapter LIX: The Crusades.—Part III.

      Philip Augustus, and Richard the First, are the only kings of
      France and England who have fought under the same banners; but
      the holy service in which they were enlisted was incessantly
      disturbed by their national jealousy; and the two factions, which
      they protected in Palestine, were more averse to each other than
      to the common enemy. In the eyes of the Orientals; the French
      monarch was superior in dignity and power; and, in the emperor’s
      absence, the Latins revered him as their temporal chief. 71 His
      exploits were not adequate to his fame. Philip was brave, but the
      statesman predominated in his character; he was soon weary of
      sacrificing his health and interest on a barren coast: the
      surrender of Acre became the signal of his departure; nor could
      he justify this unpopular desertion, by leaving the duke of
      Burgundy with five hundred knights and ten thousand foot, for the
      service of the Holy Land. The king of England, though inferior in
      dignity, surpassed his rival in wealth and military renown; 72
      and if heroism be confined to brutal and ferocious valor, Richard
      Plantagenet will stand high among the heroes of the age. The
      memory of _Cur de Lion_, of the lion-hearted prince, was long
      dear and glorious to his English subjects; and, at the distance
      of sixty years, it was celebrated in proverbial sayings by the
      grandsons of the Turks and Saracens, against whom he had fought:
      his tremendous name was employed by the Syrian mothers to silence
      their infants; and if a horse suddenly started from the way, his
      rider was wont to exclaim, “Dost thou think King Richard is in
      that bush?” 73 His cruelty to the Mahometans was the effect of
      temper and zeal; but I cannot believe that a soldier, so free and
      fearless in the use of his lance, would have descended to whet a
      dagger against his valiant brother Conrad of Montferrat, who was
      slain at Tyre by some secret assassins. 74 After the surrender of
      Acre, and the departure of Philip, the king of England led the
      crusaders to the recovery of the sea-coast; and the cities of
      Cæsarea and Jaffa were added to the fragments of the kingdom of
      Lusignan. A march of one hundred miles from Acre to Ascalon was a
      great and perpetual battle of eleven days. In the disorder of his
      troops, Saladin remained on the field with seventeen guards,
      without lowering his standard, or suspending the sound of his
      brazen kettle-drum: he again rallied and renewed the charge; and
      his preachers or heralds called aloud on the _unitarians_,
      manfully to stand up against the Christian idolaters. But the
      progress of these idolaters was irresistible; and it was only by
      demolishing the walls and buildings of Ascalon, that the sultan
      could prevent them from occupying an important fortress on the
      confines of Egypt. During a severe winter, the armies slept; but
      in the spring, the Franks advanced within a day’s march of
      Jerusalem, under the leading standard of the English king; and
      his active spirit intercepted a convoy, or caravan, of seven
      thousand camels. Saladin 75 had fixed his station in the holy
      city; but the city was struck with consternation and discord: he
      fasted; he prayed; he preached; he offered to share the dangers
      of the siege; but his Mamalukes, who remembered the fate of their
      companions at Acre, pressed the sultan with loyal or seditious
      clamors, to reserve _his_ person and _their_ courage for the
      future defence of the religion and empire. 76 The Moslems were
      delivered by the sudden, or, as they deemed, the miraculous,
      retreat of the Christians; 77 and the laurels of Richard were
      blasted by the prudence, or envy, of his companions. The hero,
      ascending a hill, and veiling his face, exclaimed with an
      indignant voice, “Those who are unwilling to rescue, are unworthy
      to view, the sepulchre of Christ!” After his return to Acre, on
      the news that Jaffa was surprised by the sultan, he sailed with
      some merchant vessels, and leaped foremost on the beach: the
      castle was relieved by his presence; and sixty thousand Turks and
      Saracens fled before his arms. The discovery of his weakness,
      provoked them to return in the morning; and they found him
      carelessly encamped before the gates with only seventeen knights
      and three hundred archers. Without counting their numbers, he
      sustained their charge; and we learn from the evidence of his
      enemies, that the king of England, grasping his lance, rode
      furiously along their front, from the right to the left wing,
      without meeting an adversary who dared to encounter his career.

      Inscriptions, tom. xv. p. 155—163,) a pretended letter from the

      Oriental authority, (the continuator of Tabari,) to have employed

      to depart, in alterum virum mutatus est, (p. 1123.) Yet

      Burgundy, (p. 116,) without supposing, like Matthew Paris, that
      he was bribed by Saladin.]

      (Vinisauf, l. vi. c. 14—24, p. 412—421. Hist. Major, p. 137—143;)
      and on the whole of this war there is a marvellous agreement
      between the Christian and Mahometan writers, who mutually praise
      the virtues of their enemies.]

      During these hostilities, a languid and tedious negotiation 79
      between the Franks and Moslems was started, and continued, and
      broken, and again resumed, and again broken. Some acts of royal
      courtesy, the gift of snow and fruit, the exchange of Norway
      hawks and Arabian horses, softened the asperity of religious war:
      from the vicissitude of success, the monarchs might learn to
      suspect that Heaven was neutral in the quarrel; nor, after the
      trial of each other, could either hope for a decisive victory. 80
      The health both of Richard and Saladin appeared to be in a
      declining state; and they respectively suffered the evils of
      distant and domestic warfare: Plantagenet was impatient to punish
      a perfidious rival who had invaded Normandy in his absence; and
      the indefatigable sultan was subdued by the cries of the people,
      who was the victim, and of the soldiers, who were the
      instruments, of his martial zeal. The first demands of the king
      of England were the restitution of Jerusalem, Palestine, and the
      true cross; and he firmly declared, that himself and his brother
      pilgrims would end their lives in the pious labor, rather than
      return to Europe with ignominy and remorse. But the conscience of
      Saladin refused, without some weighty compensation, to restore
      the idols, or promote the idolatry, of the Christians; he
      asserted, with equal firmness, his religious and civil claim to
      the sovereignty of Palestine; descanted on the importance and
      sanctity of Jerusalem; and rejected all terms of the
      establishment, or partition of the Latins. The marriage which
      Richard proposed, of his sister with the sultan’s brother, was
      defeated by the difference of faith; the princess abhorred the
      embraces of a Turk; and Adel, or Saphadin, would not easily
      renounce a plurality of wives. A personal interview was declined
      by Saladin, who alleged their mutual ignorance of each other’s
      language; and the negotiation was managed with much art and delay
      by their interpreters and envoys. The final agreement was equally
      disapproved by the zealots of both parties, by the Roman pontiff
      and the caliph of Bagdad. It was stipulated that Jerusalem and
      the holy sepulchre should be open, without tribute or vexation,
      to the pilgrimage of the Latin Christians; that, after the
      demolition of Ascalon, they should inclusively possess the
      sea-coast from Jaffa to Tyre; that the count of Tripoli and the
      prince of Antioch should be comprised in the truce; and that,
      during three years and three months, all hostilities should
      cease. The principal chiefs of the two armies swore to the
      observance of the treaty; but the monarchs were satisfied with
      giving their word and their right hand; and the royal majesty was
      excused from an oath, which always implies some suspicion of
      falsehood and dishonor. Richard embarked for Europe, to seek a
      long captivity and a premature grave; and the space of a few
      months concluded the life and glories of Saladin. The Orientals
      describe his edifying death, which happened at Damascus; but they
      seem ignorant of the equal distribution of his alms among the
      three religions, 81 or of the display of a shroud, instead of a
      standard, to admonish the East of the instability of human
      greatness. The unity of empire was dissolved by his death; his
      sons were oppressed by the stronger arm of their uncle Saphadin;
      the hostile interests of the sultans of Egypt, Damascus, and
      Aleppo, 82 were again revived; and the Franks or Latins stood and
      breathed, and hoped, in their fortresses along the Syrian coast.

      Orientale.]

      The noblest monument of a conqueror’s fame, and of the terror
      which he inspired, is the Saladine tenth, a general tax which was
      imposed on the laity, and even the clergy, of the Latin church,
      for the service of the holy war. The practice was too lucrative
      to expire with the occasion: and this tribute became the
      foundation of all the tithes and tenths on ecclesiastical
      benefices, which have been granted by the Roman pontiffs to
      Catholic sovereigns, or reserved for the immediate use of the
      apostolic see. 83 This pecuniary emolument must have tended to
      increase the interest of the popes in the recovery of Palestine:
      after the death of Saladin, they preached the crusade, by their
      epistles, their legates, and their missionaries; and the
      accomplishment of the pious work might have been expected from
      the zeal and talents of Innocent the Third. 84 Under that young
      and ambitious priest, the successors of St. Peter attained the
      full meridian of their greatness: and in a reign of eighteen
      years, he exercised a despotic command over the emperors and
      kings, whom he raised and deposed; over the nations, whom an
      interdict of months or years deprived, for the offence of their
      rulers, of the exercise of Christian worship. In the council of
      the Lateran he acted as the ecclesiastical, almost as the
      temporal, sovereign of the East and West. It was at the feet of
      his legate that John of England surrendered his crown; and
      Innocent may boast of the two most signal triumphs over sense and
      humanity, the establishment of transubstantiation, and the origin
      of the inquisition. At his voice, two crusades, the fourth and
      the fifth, were undertaken; but, except a king of Hungary, the
      princes of the second order were at the head of the pilgrims: the
      forces were inadequate to the design; nor did the effects
      correspond with the hopes and wishes of the pope and the people.
      The fourth crusade was diverted from Syria to Constantinople; and
      the conquest of the Greek or Roman empire by the Latins will form
      the proper and important subject of the next chapter. In the
      fifth, 85 two hundred thousand Franks were landed at the eastern
      mouth of the Nile. They reasonably hoped that Palestine must be
      subdued in Egypt, the seat and storehouse of the sultan; and,
      after a siege of sixteen months, the Moslems deplored the loss of
      Damietta. But the Christian army was ruined by the pride and
      insolence of the legate Pelagius, who, in the pope’s name,
      assumed the character of general: the sickly Franks were
      encompassed by the waters of the Nile and the Oriental forces;
      and it was by the evacuation of Damietta that they obtained a
      safe retreat, some concessions for the pilgrims, and the tardy
      restitution of the doubtful relic of the true cross. The failure
      may in some measure be ascribed to the abuse and multiplication
      of the crusades, which were preached at the same time against the
      Pagans of Livonia, the Moors of Spain, the Albigeois of France,
      and the kings of Sicily of the Imperial family. 86 In these
      meritorious services, the volunteers might acquire at home the
      same spiritual indulgence, and a larger measure of temporal
      rewards; and even the popes, in their zeal against a domestic
      enemy, were sometimes tempted to forget the distress of their
      Syrian brethren. From the last age of the crusades they derived
      the occasional command of an army and revenue; and some deep
      reasoners have suspected that the whole enterprise, from the
      first synod of Placentia, was contrived and executed by the
      policy of Rome. The suspicion is not founded, either in nature or
      in fact. The successors of St. Peter appear to have followed,
      rather than guided, the impulse of manners and prejudice; without
      much foresight of the seasons, or cultivation of the soil, they
      gathered the ripe and spontaneous fruits of the superstition of
      the times. They gathered these fruits without toil or personal
      danger: in the council of the Lateran, Innocent the Third
      declared an ambiguous resolution of animating the crusaders by
      his example; but the pilot of the sacred vessel could not abandon
      the helm; nor was Palestine ever blessed with the presence of a
      Roman pontiff. 87

      Mosheim, (Institut. Hist. Ecclés. p. 332,) and the fine
      philosophy of Hume, (Hist. of England, vol. i. p. 330.)]

      The persons, the families, and estates of the pilgrims, were
      under the immediate protection of the popes; and these spiritual
      patrons soon claimed the prerogative of directing their
      operations, and enforcing, by commands and censures, the
      accomplishment of their vow. Frederic the Second, 88 the grandson
      of Barbarossa, was successively the pupil, the enemy, and the
      victim of the church. At the age of twenty-one years, and in
      obedience to his guardian Innocent the Third, he assumed the
      cross; the same promise was repeated at his royal and imperial
      coronations; and his marriage with the heiress of Jerusalem
      forever bound him to defend the kingdom of his son Conrad. But as
      Frederic advanced in age and authority, he repented of the rash
      engagements of his youth: his liberal sense and knowledge taught
      him to despise the phantoms of superstition and the crowns of
      Asia: he no longer entertained the same reverence for the
      successors of Innocent: and his ambition was occupied by the
      restoration of the Italian monarchy from Sicily to the Alps. But
      the success of this project would have reduced the popes to their
      primitive simplicity; and, after the delays and excuses of twelve
      years, they urged the emperor, with entreaties and threats, to
      fix the time and place of his departure for Palestine. In the
      harbors of Sicily and Apulia, he prepared a fleet of one hundred
      galleys, and of one hundred vessels, that were framed to
      transport and land two thousand five hundred knights, with their
      horses and attendants; his vassals of Naples and Germany formed a
      powerful army; and the number of English crusaders was magnified
      to sixty thousand by the report of fame. But the inevitable or
      affected slowness of these mighty preparations consumed the
      strength and provisions of the more indigent pilgrims: the
      multitude was thinned by sickness and desertion; and the sultry
      summer of Calabria anticipated the mischiefs of a Syrian
      campaign. At length the emperor hoisted sail at Brundusium, with
      a fleet and army of forty thousand men: but he kept the sea no
      more than three days; and his hasty retreat, which was ascribed
      by his friends to a grievous indisposition, was accused by his
      enemies as a voluntary and obstinate disobedience. For suspending
      his vow was Frederic excommunicated by Gregory the Ninth; for
      presuming, the next year, to accomplish his vow, he was again
      excommunicated by the same pope. 89 While he served under the
      banner of the cross, a crusade was preached against him in Italy;
      and after his return he was compelled to ask pardon for the
      injuries which he had suffered. The clergy and military orders of
      Palestine were previously instructed to renounce his communion
      and dispute his commands; and in his own kingdom, the emperor was
      forced to consent that the orders of the camp should be issued in
      the name of God and of the Christian republic. Frederic entered
      Jerusalem in triumph; and with his own hands (for no priest would
      perform the office) he took the crown from the altar of the holy
      sepulchre. But the patriarch cast an interdict on the church
      which his presence had profaned; and the knights of the hospital
      and temple informed the sultan how easily he might be surprised
      and slain in his unguarded visit to the River Jordan. In such a
      state of fanaticism and faction, victory was hopeless, and
      defence was difficult; but the conclusion of an advantageous
      peace may be imputed to the discord of the Mahometans, and their
      personal esteem for the character of Frederic. The enemy of the
      church is accused of maintaining with the miscreants an
      intercourse of hospitality and friendship unworthy of a
      Christian; of despising the barrenness of the land; and of
      indulging a profane thought, that if Jehovah had seen the kingdom
      of Naples he never would have selected Palestine for the
      inheritance of his chosen people. Yet Frederic obtained from the
      sultan the restitution of Jerusalem, of Bethlem and Nazareth, of
      Tyre and Sidon; the Latins were allowed to inhabit and fortify
      the city; an equal code of civil and religious freedom was
      ratified for the sectaries of Jesus and those of Mahomet; and,
      while the former worshipped at the holy sepulchre, the latter
      might pray and preach in the mosque of the temple, 90 from whence
      the prophet undertook his nocturnal journey to heaven. The clergy
      deplored this scandalous toleration; and the weaker Moslems were
      gradually expelled; but every rational object of the crusades was
      accomplished without bloodshed; the churches were restored, the
      monasteries were replenished; and, in the space of fifteen years,
      the Latins of Jerusalem exceeded the number of six thousand. This
      peace and prosperity, for which they were ungrateful to their
      benefactor, was terminated by the irruption of the strange and
      savage hordes of Carizmians. 91 Flying from the arms of the
      Moguls, those shepherds 911 of the Caspian rolled headlong on
      Syria; and the union of the Franks with the sultans of Aleppo,
      Hems, and Damascus, was insufficient to stem the violence of the
      torrent. Whatever stood against them was cut off by the sword, or
      dragged into captivity: the military orders were almost
      exterminated in a single battle; and in the pillage of the city,
      in the profanation of the holy sepulchre, the Latins confess and
      regret the modesty and discipline of the Turks and Saracens.

      Of the seven crusades, the two last were undertaken by Louis the
      Ninth, king of France; who lost his liberty in Egypt, and his
      life on the coast of Africa. Twenty-eight years after his death,
      he was canonized at Rome; and sixty-five miracles were readily
      found, and solemnly attested, to justify the claim of the royal
      saint. 92 The voice of history renders a more honorable
      testimony, that he united the virtues of a king, a hero, and a
      man; that his martial spirit was tempered by the love of private
      and public justice; and that Louis was the father of his people,
      the friend of his neighbors, and the terror of the infidels.
      Superstition alone, in all the extent of her baleful influence,
      93 corrupted his understanding and his heart: his devotion
      stooped to admire and imitate the begging friars of Francis and
      Dominic: he pursued with blind and cruel zeal the enemies of the
      faith; and the best of kings twice descended from his throne to
      seek the adventures of a spiritual knight-errant. A monkish
      historian would have been content to applaud the most despicable
      part of his character; but the noble and gallant Joinville, 94
      who shared the friendship and captivity of Louis, has traced with
      the pencil of nature the free portrait of his virtues as well as
      of his failings. From this intimate knowledge we may learn to
      suspect the political views of depressing their great vassals,
      which are so often imputed to the royal authors of the crusades.
      Above all the princes of the middle ages, Louis the Ninth
      successfully labored to restore the prerogatives of the crown;
      but it was at home and not in the East, that he acquired for
      himself and his posterity: his vow was the result of enthusiasm
      and sickness; and if he were the promoter, he was likewise the
      victim, of his holy madness. For the invasion of Egypt, France
      was exhausted of her troops and treasures; he covered the sea of
      Cyprus with eighteen hundred sails; the most modest enumeration
      amounts to fifty thousand men; and, if we might trust his own
      confession, as it is reported by Oriental vanity, he disembarked
      nine thousand five hundred horse, and one hundred and thirty
      thousand foot, who performed their pilgrimage under the shadow of
      his power. 95

      In complete armor, the oriflamme waving before him, Louis leaped
      foremost on the beach; and the strong city of Damietta, which had
      cost his predecessors a siege of sixteen months, was abandoned on
      the first assault by the trembling Moslems. But Damietta was the
      first and the last of his conquests; and in the fifth and sixth
      crusades, the same causes, almost on the same ground, were
      productive of similar calamities. 96 After a ruinous delay, which
      introduced into the camp the seeds of an epidemic disease, the
      Franks advanced from the sea-coast towards the capital of Egypt,
      and strove to surmount the unseasonable inundation of the Nile,
      which opposed their progress. Under the eye of their intrepid
      monarch, the barons and knights of France displayed their
      invincible contempt of danger and discipline: his brother, the
      count of Artois, stormed with inconsiderate valor the town of
      Massoura; and the carrier pigeons announced to the inhabitants of
      Cairo that all was lost. But a soldier, who afterwards usurped
      the sceptre, rallied the flying troops: the main body of the
      Christians was far behind the vanguard; and Artois was
      overpowered and slain. A shower of Greek fire was incessantly
      poured on the invaders; the Nile was commanded by the Egyptian
      galleys, the open country by the Arabs; all provisions were
      intercepted; each day aggravated the sickness and famine; and
      about the same time a retreat was found to be necessary and
      impracticable. The Oriental writers confess, that Louis might
      have escaped, if he would have deserted his subjects; he was made
      prisoner, with the greatest part of his nobles; all who could not
      redeem their lives by service or ransom were inhumanly massacred;
      and the walls of Cairo were decorated with a circle of Christian
      heads. 97 The king of France was loaded with chains; but the
      generous victor, a great-grandson of the brother of Saladin, sent
      a robe of honor to his royal captive, and his deliverance, with
      that of his soldiers, was obtained by the restitution of Damietta
      98 and the payment of four hundred thousand pieces of gold. In a
      soft and luxurious climate, the degenerate children of the
      companions of Noureddin and Saladin were incapable of resisting
      the flower of European chivalry: they triumphed by the arms of
      their slaves or Mamalukes, the hardy natives of Tartary, who at a
      tender age had been purchased of the Syrian merchants, and were
      educated in the camp and palace of the sultan. But Egypt soon
      afforded a new example of the danger of prætorian bands; and the
      rage of these ferocious animals, who had been let loose on the
      strangers, was provoked to devour their benefactor. In the pride
      of conquest, Touran Shaw, the last of his race, was murdered by
      his Mamalukes; and the most daring of the assassins entered the
      chamber of the captive king, with drawn cimeters, and their hands
      imbrued in the blood of their sultan. The firmness of Louis
      commanded their respect; 99 their avarice prevailed over cruelty
      and zeal; the treaty was accomplished; and the king of France,
      with the relics of his army, was permitted to embark for
      Palestine. He wasted four years within the walls of Acre, unable
      to visit Jerusalem, and unwilling to return without glory to his
      native country.

      The memory of his defeat excited Louis, after sixteen years of
      wisdom and repose, to undertake the seventh and last of the
      crusades. His finances were restored, his kingdom was enlarged; a
      new generation of warriors had arisen, and he advanced with fresh
      confidence at the head of six thousand horse and thirty thousand
      foot. The loss of Antioch had provoked the enterprise; a wild
      hope of baptizing the king of Tunis tempted him to steer for the
      African coast; and the report of an immense treasure reconciled
      his troops to the delay of their voyage to the Holy Land. Instead
      of a proselyte, he found a siege: the French panted and died on
      the burning sands: St. Louis expired in his tent; and no sooner
      had he closed his eyes, than his son and successor gave the
      signal of the retreat. 100 “It is thus,” says a lively writer,
      “that a Christian king died near the ruins of Carthage, waging
      war against the sectaries of Mahomet, in a land to which Dido had
      introduced the deities of Syria.” 101

      A more unjust and absurd constitution cannot be devised than that
      which condemns the natives of a country to perpetual servitude,
      under the arbitrary dominion of strangers and slaves. Yet such
      has been the state of Egypt above five hundred years. The most
      illustrious sultans of the Baharite and Borgite dynasties 102
      were themselves promoted from the Tartar and Circassian bands;
      and the four-and-twenty beys, or military chiefs, have ever been
      succeeded, not by their sons, but by their servants. They produce
      the great charter of their liberties, the treaty of Selim the
      First with the republic: 103 and the Othman emperor still accepts
      from Egypt a slight acknowledgment of tribute and subjection.
      With some breathing intervals of peace and order, the two
      dynasties are marked as a period of rapine and bloodshed: 104 but
      their throne, however shaken, reposed on the two pillars of
      discipline and valor: their sway extended over Egypt, Nubia,
      Arabia, and Syria: their Mamalukes were multiplied from eight
      hundred to twenty-five thousand horse; and their numbers were
      increased by a provincial militia of one hundred and seven
      thousand foot, and the occasional aid of sixty-six thousand
      Arabs. 105 Princes of such power and spirit could not long endure
      on their coast a hostile and independent nation; and if the ruin
      of the Franks was postponed about forty years, they were indebted
      to the cares of an unsettled reign, to the invasion of the
      Moguls, and to the occasional aid of some warlike pilgrims. Among
      these, the English reader will observe the name of our first
      Edward, who assumed the cross in the lifetime of his father
      Henry. At the head of a thousand soldiers the future conqueror of
      Wales and Scotland delivered Acre from a siege; marched as far as
      Nazareth with an army of nine thousand men; emulated the fame of
      his uncle Richard; extorted, by his valor, a ten years’ truce;
      1051 and escaped, with a dangerous wound, from the dagger of a
      fanatic _assassin_. 106 1061 Antioch, 107 whose situation had
      been less exposed to the calamities of the holy war, was finally
      occupied and ruined by Bondocdar, or Bibars, sultan of Egypt and
      Syria; the Latin principality was extinguished; and the first
      seat of the Christian name was dispeopled by the slaughter of
      seventeen, and the captivity of one hundred, thousand of her
      inhabitants. The maritime towns of Laodicea, Gabala, Tripoli,
      Berytus, Sidon, Tyre and Jaffa, and the stronger castles of the
      Hospitallers and Templars, successively fell; and the whole
      existence of the Franks was confined to the city and colony of
      St. John of Acre, which is sometimes described by the more
      classic title of Ptolemais.

      arms, riches, and power. See a new Abrégé de l’Histoire Ottomane,

      After the loss of Jerusalem, Acre, 108 which is distant about
      seventy miles, became the metropolis of the Latin Christians, and
      was adorned with strong and stately buildings, with aqueducts, an
      artificial port, and a double wall. The population was increased
      by the incessant streams of pilgrims and fugitives: in the pauses
      of hostility the trade of the East and West was attracted to this
      convenient station; and the market could offer the produce of
      every clime and the interpreters of every tongue. But in this
      conflux of nations, every vice was propagated and practised: of
      all the disciples of Jesus and Mahomet, the male and female
      inhabitants of Acre were esteemed the most corrupt; nor could the
      abuse of religion be corrected by the discipline of law. The city
      had many sovereigns, and no government. The kings of Jerusalem
      and Cyprus, of the house of Lusignan, the princes of Antioch, the
      counts of Tripoli and Sidon, the great masters of the hospital,
      the temple, and the Teutonic order, the republics of Venice,
      Genoa, and Pisa, the pope’s legate, the kings of France and
      England, assumed an independent command: seventeen tribunals
      exercised the power of life and death; every criminal was
      protected in the adjacent quarter; and the perpetual jealousy of
      the nations often burst forth in acts of violence and blood. Some
      adventurers, who disgraced the ensign of the cross, compensated
      their want of pay by the plunder of the Mahometan villages:
      nineteen Syrian merchants, who traded under the public faith,
      were despoiled and hanged by the Christians; and the denial of
      satisfaction justified the arms of the sultan Khalil. He marched
      against Acre, at the head of sixty thousand horse and one hundred
      and forty thousand foot: his train of artillery (if I may use the
      word) was numerous and weighty: the separate timbers of a single
      engine were transported in one hundred wagons; and the royal
      historian Abulfeda, who served with the troops of Hamah, was
      himself a spectator of the holy war. Whatever might be the vices
      of the Franks, their courage was rekindled by enthusiasm and
      despair; but they were torn by the discord of seventeen chiefs,
      and overwhelmed on all sides by the powers of the sultan. After a
      siege of thirty three days, the double wall was forced by the
      Moslems; the principal tower yielded to their engines; the
      Mamalukes made a general assault; the city was stormed; and death
      or slavery was the lot of sixty thousand Christians. The convent,
      or rather fortress, of the Templars resisted three days longer;
      but the great master was pierced with an arrow; and, of five
      hundred knights, only ten were left alive, less happy than the
      victims of the sword, if they lived to suffer on a scaffold, in
      the unjust and cruel proscription of the whole order. The king of
      Jerusalem, the patriarch and the great master of the hospital,
      effected their retreat to the shore; but the sea was rough, the
      vessels were insufficient; and great numbers of the fugitives
      were drowned before they could reach the Isle of Cyprus, which
      might comfort Lusignan for the loss of Palestine. By the command
      of the sultan, the churches and fortifications of the Latin
      cities were demolished: a motive of avarice or fear still opened
      the holy sepulchre to some devout and defenceless pilgrims; and a
      mournful and solitary silence prevailed along the coast which had
      so long resounded with the world’s debate. 109
