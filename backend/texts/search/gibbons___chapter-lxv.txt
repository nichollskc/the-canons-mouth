Chapter LXV: Elevation Of Timour Or Tamerlane, And His
      Death.—Part I.

     Elevation Of Timour Or Tamerlane To The Throne Of Samarcand.—His
     Conquests In Persia, Georgia, Tartary Russia, India, Syria, And
     Anatolia.—His Turkish War.— Defeat And Captivity Of Bajazet.—Death
     Of Timour.—Civil War Of The Sons Of Bajazet.—Restoration Of The
     Turkish Monarchy By Mahomet The First.—Siege Of Constantinople By
     Amurath The Second.

      The conquest and monarchy of the world was the first object of
      the ambition of Timour. To live in the memory and esteem of
      future ages was the second wish of his magnanimous spirit. All
      the civil and military transactions of his reign were diligently
      recorded in the journals of his secretaries: 1 the authentic
      narrative was revised by the persons best informed of each
      particular transaction; and it is believed in the empire and
      family of Timour, that the monarch himself composed the
      _commentaries_ 2 of his life, and the _institutions_ 3 of his
      government. 4 But these cares were ineffectual for the
      preservation of his fame, and these precious memorials in the
      Mogul or Persian language were concealed from the world, or, at
      least, from the knowledge of Europe. The nations which he
      vanquished exercised a base and impotent revenge; and ignorance
      has long repeated the tale of calumny, 5 which had disfigured the
      birth and character, the person, and even the name, of
      _Tamerlane_. 6 Yet his real merit would be enhanced, rather than
      debased, by the elevation of a peasant to the throne of Asia; nor
      can his lameness be a theme of reproach, unless he had the
      weakness to blush at a natural, or perhaps an honorable,
      infirmity. 606

      1 (return) [ These journals were communicated to Sherefeddin, or
      Cherefeddin Ali, a native of Yezd, who composed in the Persian
      language a history of Timour Beg, which has been translated into
      French by M. Petit de la Croix, (Paris, 1722, in 4 vols. 12 mo.,)
      and has always been my faithful guide. His geography and
      chronology are wonderfully accurate; and he may be trusted for
      public facts, though he servilely praises the virtue and fortune
      of the hero. Timour’s attention to procure intelligence from his
      own and foreign countries may be seen in the Institutions, p.
      215, 217, 349, 351.]

      2 (return) [ These Commentaries are yet unknown in Europe: but
      Mr. White gives some hope that they may be imported and
      translated by his friend Major Davy, who had read in the East
      this “minute and faithful narrative of an interesting and
      eventful period.” * Note: The manuscript of Major Davy has been
      translated by Major Stewart, and published by the Oriental
      Translation Committee of London. It contains the life of Timour,
      from his birth to his forty-first year; but the last thirty years
      of western war and conquest are wanting. Major Stewart intimates
      that two manuscripts exist in this country containing the whole
      work, but excuses himself, on account of his age, from
      undertaking the laborious task of completing the translation. It
      is to be hoped that the European public will be soon enabled to
      judge of the value and authenticity of the Commentaries of the
      Cæsar of the East. Major Stewart’s work commences with the Book
      of Dreams and Omens—a wild, but characteristic, chronicle of
      Visions and Sortes Koranicæ. Strange that a life of Timour should
      awaken a reminiscence of the diary of Archbishop Laud! The early
      dawn and the gradual expression of his not less splendid but more
      real visions of ambition are touched with the simplicity of truth
      and nature. But we long to escape from the petty feuds of the
      pastoral chieftain, to the triumphs and the legislation of the
      conqueror of the world.—M.]

      3 (return) [ I am ignorant whether the original institution, in
      the Turki or Mogul language, be still extant. The Persic version,
      with an English translation, and most valuable index, was
      published (Oxford, 1783, in 4to.) by the joint labors of Major
      Davy and Mr. White, the Arabic professor. This work has been
      since translated from the Persic into French, (Paris, 1787,) by
      M. Langlès, a learned Orientalist, who has added the life of
      Timour, and many curious notes.]

      4 (return) [ Shaw Allum, the present Mogul, reads, values, but
      cannot imitate, the institutions of his great ancestor. The
      English translator relies on their internal evidence; but if any
      suspicions should arise of fraud and fiction, they will not be
      dispelled by Major Davy’s letter. The Orientals have never
      cultivated the art of criticism; the patronage of a prince, less
      honorable, perhaps, is not less lucrative than that of a
      bookseller; nor can it be deemed incredible that a Persian, the
      _real_ author, should renounce the credit, to raise the value and
      price, of the work.]

      5 (return) [ The original of the tale is found in the following
      work, which is much esteemed for its florid elegance of style:
      _Ahmedis Arabsiad_ (Ahmed Ebn Arabshah) _Vitæ et Rerum gestarum
      Timuri. Arabice et Latine. Edidit Samuel Henricus Manger.
      Franequer_, 1767, 2 tom. in 4to. This Syrian author is ever a
      malicious, and often an ignorant enemy: the very titles of his
      chapters are injurious; as how the wicked, as how the impious, as
      how the viper, &c. The copious article of Timur, in Bibliothèque
      Orientale, is of a mixed nature, as D’Herbelot indifferently
      draws his materials (p. 877—888) from Khondemir Ebn Schounah, and
      the Lebtarikh.]

      6 (return) [ _Demir_ or _Timour_ signifies in the Turkish
      language, Iron; and it is the appellation of a lord or prince. By
      the change of a letter or accent, it is changed into _Lenc_, or
      Lame; and a European corruption confounds the two words in the
      name of Tamerlane. * Note: According to the memoirs he was so
      called by a Shaikh, who, when visited by his mother on his birth,
      was reading the verse of the Koran, “Are you sure that he who
      dwelleth in heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you up,
      and behold _it shall shake_, Tamûrn.” The Shaikh then stopped and
      said, “We have named your son _Timûr_,” p. 21.—M.]

      606 (return) [ He was lamed by a wound at the siege of the
      capital of Sistan. Sherefeddin, lib. iii. c. 17. p. 136. See Von
      Hammer, vol. i. p. 260.—M.]

      In the eyes of the Moguls, who held the indefeasible succession
      of the house of Zingis, he was doubtless a rebel subject; yet he
      sprang from the noble tribe of Berlass: his fifth ancestor,
      Carashar Nevian, had been the vizier 607 of Zagatai, in his new
      realm of Transoxiana; and in the ascent of some generations, the
      branch of Timour is confounded, at least by the females, 7 with
      the Imperial stem. 8 He was born forty miles to the south of
      Samarcand in the village of Sebzar, in the fruitful territory of
      Cash, of which his fathers were the hereditary chiefs, as well as
      of a toman of ten thousand horse. 9 His birth 10 was cast on one
      of those periods of anarchy, which announce the fall of the
      Asiatic dynasties, and open a new field to adventurous ambition.
      The khans of Zagatai were extinct; the emirs aspired to
      independence; and their domestic feuds could only be suspended by
      the conquest and tyranny of the khans of Kashgar, who, with an
      army of Getes or Calmucks, 11 invaded the Transoxian kingdom.
      From the twelfth year of his age, Timour had entered the field of
      action; in the twenty-fifth 111 he stood forth as the deliverer
      of his country; and the eyes and wishes of the people were turned
      towards a hero who suffered in their cause. The chiefs of the law
      and of the army had pledged their salvation to support him with
      their lives and fortunes; but in the hour of danger they were
      silent and afraid; and, after waiting seven days on the hills of
      Samarcand, he retreated to the desert with only sixty horsemen.
      The fugitives were overtaken by a thousand Getes, whom he
      repulsed with incredible slaughter, and his enemies were forced
      to exclaim, “Timour is a wonderful man: fortune and the divine
      favor are with him.” But in this bloody action his own followers
      were reduced to ten, a number which was soon diminished by the
      desertion of three Carizmians. 112 He wandered in the desert with
      his wife, seven companions, and four horses; and sixty-two days
      was he plunged in a loathsome dungeon, from whence he escaped by
      his own courage and the remorse of the oppressor. After swimming
      the broad and rapid steam of the Jihoon, or Oxus, he led, during
      some months, the life of a vagrant and outlaw, on the borders of
      the adjacent states. But his fame shone brighter in adversity; he
      learned to distinguish the friends of his person, the associates
      of his fortune, and to apply the various characters of men for
      their advantage, and, above all, for his own. On his return to
      his native country, Timour was successively joined by the parties
      of his confederates, who anxiously sought him in the desert; nor
      can I refuse to describe, in his pathetic simplicity, one of
      their fortunate encounters. He presented himself as a guide to
      three chiefs, who were at the head of seventy horse. “When their
      eyes fell upon me,” says Timour, “they were overwhelmed with joy;
      and they alighted from their horses; and they came and kneeled;
      and they kissed my stirrup. I also came down from my horse, and
      took each of them in my arms. And I put my turban on the head of
      the first chief; and my girdle, rich in jewels and wrought with
      gold, I bound on the loins of the second; and the third I clothed
      in my own coat. And they wept, and I wept also; and the hour of
      prayer was arrived, and we prayed. And we mounted our horses, and
      came to my dwelling; and I collected my people, and made a
      feast.” His trusty bands were soon increased by the bravest of
      the tribes; he led them against a superior foe; and, after some
      vicissitudes of war the Getes were finally driven from the
      kingdom of Transoxiana. He had done much for his own glory; but
      much remained to be done, much art to be exerted, and some blood
      to be spilt, before he could teach his equals to obey him as
      their master. The birth and power of emir Houssein compelled him
      to accept a vicious and unworthy colleague, whose sister was the
      best beloved of his wives. Their union was short and jealous; but
      the policy of Timour, in their frequent quarrels, exposed his
      rival to the reproach of injustice and perfidy; and, after a
      final defeat, Houssein was slain by some sagacious friends, who
      presumed, for the last time, to disobey the commands of their
      lord. 113 At the age of thirty-four, 12 and in a general diet or
      _couroultai_, he was invested with _Imperial_ command, but he
      affected to revere the house of Zingis; and while the emir Timour
      reigned over Zagatai and the East, a nominal khan served as a
      private officer in the armies of his servant. A fertile kingdom,
      five hundred miles in length and in breadth, might have satisfied
      the ambition of a subject; but Timour aspired to the dominion of
      the world; and before his death, the crown of Zagatai was one of
      the twenty-seven crowns which he had placed on his head. Without
      expatiating on the victories of thirty-five campaigns; without
      describing the lines of march, which he repeatedly traced over
      the continent of Asia; I shall briefly represent his conquests
      in, I. Persia, II. Tartary, and, III. India, 13 and from thence
      proceed to the more interesting narrative of his Ottoman war.

      607 (return) [ In the memoirs, the title Gurgân is in one place
      (p. 23) interpreted the son-in-law; in another (p. 28) as Kurkan,
      great prince, generalissimo, and prime minister of Jagtai.—M.]

      7 (return) [ After relating some false and foolish tales of
      Timour _Lenc_, Arabshah is compelled to speak truth, and to own
      him for a kinsman of Zingis, per mulieres, (as he peevishly
      adds,) laqueos Satanæ, (pars i. c. i. p. 25.) The testimony of
      Abulghazi Khan (P. ii. c. 5, P. v. c. 4) is clear,
      unquestionable, and decisive.]

      8 (return) [ According to one of the pedigrees, the fourth
      ancestor of Zingis, and the ninth of Timour, were brothers; and
      they agreed, that the posterity of the elder should succeed to
      the dignity of khan, and that the descendants of the younger
      should fill the office of their minister and general. This
      tradition was at least convenient to justify the _first_ steps of
      Timour’s ambition, (Institutions, p. 24, 25, from the MS.
      fragments of Timour’s History.)]

      9 (return) [ See the preface of Sherefeddin, and Abulfeda’s
      Geography, (Chorasmiæ, &c., Descriptio, p. 60, 61,) in the iiid
      volume of Hudson’s Minor Greek Geographers.]

      10 (return) [ See his nativity in Dr. Hyde, (Syntagma Dissertat.
      tom. ii. p. 466,) as it was cast by the astrologers of his
      grandson Ulugh Beg. He was born, A.D. 1336, April 9, 11º 57'. p.
      m., lat. 36. I know not whether they can prove the great
      conjunction of the planets from whence, like other conquerors and
      prophets, Timour derived the surname of Saheb Keran, or master of
      the conjunctions, (Bibliot. Orient. p. 878.)]

      11 (return) [ In the Institutions of Timour, these subjects of
      the khan of Kashgar are most improperly styled Ouzbegs, or
      Usbeks, a name which belongs to another branch and country of
      Tartars, (Abulghazi, P. v. c. v. P. vii. c. 5.) Could I be sure
      that this word is in the Turkish original, I would boldly
      pronounce, that the Institutions were framed a century after the
      death of Timour, since the establishment of the Usbeks in
      Transoxiana. * Note: Col. Stewart observes, that the Persian
      translator has sometimes made use of the name Uzbek by
      anticipation. He observes, likewise, that these Jits (Getes) are
      not to be confounded with the ancient Getæ: they were unconverted
      Turks. Col. Tod (History of Rajasthan, vol. i. p. 166) would
      identify the Jits with the ancient race.—M.]

      111 (return) [ He was twenty-seven before he served his first
      wars under the emir Houssein, who ruled over Khorasan and
      Mawerainnehr. Von Hammer, vol. i. p. 262. Neither of these
      statements agrees with the Memoirs. At twelve he was a boy. “I
      fancied that I perceived in myself all the signs of greatness and
      wisdom, and whoever came to visit me, I received with great
      hauteur and dignity.” At seventeen he undertook the management of
      the flocks and herds of the family, (p. 24.) At nineteen he
      became religious, and “left off playing chess,” made a kind of
      Budhist vow never to injure living thing and felt his foot
      paralyzed from having accidentally trod upon an ant, (p. 30.) At
      twenty, thoughts of rebellion and greatness rose in his mind; at
      twenty-one, he seems to have performed his first feat of arms. He
      was a practised warrior when he served, in his twenty-seventh
      year, under Emir Houssein.]

      112 (return) [ Compare Memoirs, page 61. The imprisonment is
      there stated at fifty-three days. “At this time I made a vow to
      God that I would never keep any person, whether guilty or
      innocent, for any length of time, in prison or in chains.” p.
      63.—M.]

      113 (return) [ Timour, on one occasion, sent him this message:
      “He who wishes to embrace the bride of royalty must kiss her
      across the edge of the sharp sword,” p. 83. The scene of the
      trial of Houssein, the resistance of Timour gradually becoming
      more feeble, the vengeance of the chiefs becoming proportionably
      more determined, is strikingly portrayed. Mem. p 130.—M.]

      12 (return) [ The ist book of Sherefeddin is employed on the
      private life of the hero: and he himself, or his secretary,
      (Institutions, p. 3—77,) enlarges with pleasure on the thirteen
      designs and enterprises which most truly constitute his
      _personal_ merit. It even shines through the dark coloring of
      Arabshah, (P. i. c. 1—12.)]

      13 (return) [ The conquests of Persia, Tartary, and India, are
      represented in the iid and iiid books of Sherefeddin, and by
      Arabshah, (c. 13—55.) Consult the excellent Indexes to the
      Institutions. * Note: Compare the seventh book of Von Hammer,
      Geschichte des Osmanischen Reiches.—M.]

      I. For every war, a motive of safety or revenge, of honor or
      zeal, of right or convenience, may be readily found in the
      jurisprudence of conquerors. No sooner had Timour reunited to the
      patrimony of Zagatai the dependent countries of Carizme and
      Candahar, than he turned his eyes towards the kingdoms of Iran or
      Persia. From the Oxus to the Tigris, that extensive country was
      left without a lawful sovereign since the death of Abousaid, the
      last of the descendants of the great Holacou. Peace and justice
      had been banished from the land above forty years; and the Mogul
      invader might seem to listen to the cries of an oppressed people.
      Their petty tyrants might have opposed him with confederate arms:
      they separately stood, and successively fell; and the difference
      of their fate was only marked by the promptitude of submission or
      the obstinacy of resistance. Ibrahim, prince of Shirwan, or
      Albania, kissed the footstool of the Imperial throne. His
      peace-offerings of silks, horses, and jewels, were composed,
      according to the Tartar fashion, each article of nine pieces; but
      a critical spectator observed, that there were only eight slaves.
      “I myself am the ninth,” replied Ibrahim, who was prepared for
      the remark; and his flattery was rewarded by the smile of Timour.
      14 Shah Mansour, prince of Fars, or the proper Persia, was one of
      the least powerful, but most dangerous, of his enemies. In a
      battle under the walls of Shiraz, he broke, with three or four
      thousand soldiers, the _coul_ or main body of thirty thousand
      horse, where the emperor fought in person. No more than fourteen
      or fifteen guards remained near the standard of Timour: he stood
      firm as a rock, and received on his helmet two weighty strokes of
      a cimeter: 15 the Moguls rallied; the head of Mansour was thrown
      at his feet; and he declared his esteem of the valor of a foe, by
      extirpating all the males of so intrepid a race. From Shiraz, his
      troops advanced to the Persian Gulf; and the richness and
      weakness of Ormuz 16 were displayed in an annual tribute of six
      hundred thousand dinars of gold. Bagdad was no longer the city of
      peace, the seat of the caliphs; but the noblest conquest of
      Holacou could not be overlooked by his ambitious successor. The
      whole course of the Tigris and Euphrates, from the mouth to the
      sources of those rivers, was reduced to his obedience: he entered
      Edessa; and the Turkmans of the black sheep were chastised for
      the sacrilegious pillage of a caravan of Mecca. In the mountains
      of Georgia, the native Christians still braved the law and the
      sword of Mahomet, by three expeditions he obtained the merit of
      the _gazie_, or holy war; and the prince of Teflis became his
      proselyte and friend.

      14 (return) [ The reverence of the Tartars for the mysterious
      number of _nine_ is declared by Abulghazi Khan, who, for that
      reason, divides his Genealogical History into nine parts.]

      15 (return) [ According to Arabshah, (P. i. c. 28, p. 183,) the
      coward Timour ran away to his tent, and hid himself from the
      pursuit of Shah Mansour under the women’s garments. Perhaps
      Sherefeddin (l. iii. c. 25) has magnified his courage.]

      16 (return) [ The history of Ormuz is not unlike that of Tyre.
      The old city, on the continent, was destroyed by the Tartars, and
      renewed in a neighboring island, without fresh water or
      vegetation. The kings of Ormuz, rich in the Indian trade and the
      pearl fishery, possessed large territories both in Persia and
      Arabia; but they were at first the tributaries of the sultans of
      Kerman, and at last were delivered (A.D. 1505) by the Portuguese
      tyrants from the tyranny of their own viziers, (Marco Polo, l. i.
      c. 15, 16, fol. 7, 8. Abulfeda, Geograph. tabul. xi. p. 261, 262,
      an original Chronicle of Ormuz, in Texeira, or Stevens’s History
      of Persia, p. 376—416, and the Itineraries inserted in the ist
      volume of Ramusio, of Ludovico Barthema, (1503,) fol. 167, of
      Andrea Corsali, (1517) fol. 202, 203, and of Odoardo Barbessa,
      (in 1516,) fol. 313—318.)]

      II. A just retaliation might be urged for the invasion of
      Turkestan, or the Eastern Tartary. The dignity of Timour could
      not endure the impunity of the Getes: he passed the Sihoon,
      subdued the kingdom of Kashgar, and marched seven times into the
      heart of their country. His most distant camp was two months’
      journey, or four hundred and eighty leagues to the north-east of
      Samarcand; and his emirs, who traversed the River Irtish,
      engraved in the forests of Siberia a rude memorial of their
      exploits. The conquest of Kipzak, or the Western Tartary, 17 was
      founded on the double motive of aiding the distressed, and
      chastising the ungrateful. Toctamish, a fugitive prince, was
      entertained and protected in his court: the ambassadors of Auruss
      Khan were dismissed with a haughty denial, and followed on the
      same day by the armies of Zagatai; and their success established
      Toctamish in the Mogul empire of the North. But, after a reign of
      ten years, the new khan forgot the merits and the strength of his
      benefactor; the base usurper, as he deemed him, of the sacred
      rights of the house of Zingis. Through the gates of Derbend, he
      entered Persia at the head of ninety thousand horse: with the
      innumerable forces of Kipzak, Bulgaria, Circassia, and Russia, he
      passed the Sihoon, burnt the palaces of Timour, and compelled
      him, amidst the winter snows, to contend for Samarcand and his
      life. After a mild expostulation, and a glorious victory, the
      emperor resolved on revenge; and by the east, and the west, of
      the Caspian, and the Volga, he twice invaded Kipzak with such
      mighty powers, that thirteen miles were measured from his right
      to his left wing. In a march of five months, they rarely beheld
      the footsteps of man; and their daily subsistence was often
      trusted to the fortune of the chase. At length the armies
      encountered each other; but the treachery of the standard-bearer,
      who, in the heat of action, reversed the Imperial standard of
      Kipzak, determined the victory of the Zagatais; and Toctamish (I
      speak the language of the Institutions) gave the tribe of Toushi
      to the wind of desolation. 18 He fled to the Christian duke of
      Lithuania; again returned to the banks of the Volga; and, after
      fifteen battles with a domestic rival, at last perished in the
      wilds of Siberia. The pursuit of a flying enemy carried Timour
      into the tributary provinces of Russia: a duke of the reigning
      family was made prisoner amidst the ruins of his capital; and
      Yeletz, by the pride and ignorance of the Orientals, might easily
      be confounded with the genuine metropolis of the nation. Moscow
      trembled at the approach of the Tartar, and the resistance would
      have been feeble, since the hopes of the Russians were placed in
      a miraculous image of the Virgin, to whose protection they
      ascribed the casual and voluntary retreat of the conqueror.
      Ambition and prudence recalled him to the South, the desolate
      country was exhausted, and the Mogul soldiers were enriched with
      an immense spoil of precious furs, of linen of Antioch, 19 and of
      ingots of gold and silver. 20 On the banks of the Don, or Tanais,
      he received an humble deputation from the consuls and merchants
      of Egypt, 21 Venice, Genoa, Catalonia, and Biscay, who occupied
      the commerce and city of Tana, or Azoph, at the mouth of the
      river. They offered their gifts, admired his magnificence, and
      trusted his royal word. But the peaceful visit of an emir, who
      explored the state of the magazines and harbor, was speedily
      followed by the destructive presence of the Tartars. The city was
      reduced to ashes; the Moslems were pillaged and dismissed; but
      all the Christians, who had not fled to their ships, were
      condemned either to death or slavery. 22 Revenge prompted him to
      burn the cities of Serai and Astrachan, the monuments of rising
      civilization; and his vanity proclaimed, that he had penetrated
      to the region of perpetual daylight, a strange phenomenon, which
      authorized his Mahometan doctors to dispense with the obligation
      of evening prayer. 23

      III. When Timour first proposed to his princes and emirs the
      invasion of India or Hindostan, 24 he was answered by a murmur of
      discontent: “The rivers! and the mountains and deserts! and the
      soldiers clad in armor! and the elephants, destroyers of men!”
      But the displeasure of the emperor was more dreadful than all
      these terrors; and his superior reason was convinced, that an
      enterprise of such tremendous aspect was safe and easy in the
      execution. He was informed by his spies of the weakness and
      anarchy of Hindostan: the soubahs of the provinces had erected
      the standard of rebellion; and the perpetual infancy of Sultan
      Mahmoud was despised even in the harem of Delhi. The Mogul army
      moved in three great divisions; and Timour observes with
      pleasure, that the ninety-two squadrons of a thousand horse most
      fortunately corresponded with the ninety-two names or epithets of
      the prophet Mahomet. 241 Between the Jihoon and the Indus they
      crossed one of the ridges of mountains, which are styled by the
      Arabian geographers The Stony Girdles of the Earth. The highland
      robbers were subdued or extirpated; but great numbers of men and
      horses perished in the snow; the emperor himself was let down a
      precipice on a portable scaffold—the ropes were one hundred and
      fifty cubits in length; and before he could reach the bottom,
      this dangerous operation was five times repeated. Timour crossed
      the Indus at the ordinary passage of Attok; and successively
      traversed, in the footsteps of Alexander, the _Punjab_, or five
      rivers, 25 that fall into the master stream. From Attok to Delhi,
      the high road measures no more than six hundred miles; but the
      two conquerors deviated to the south-east; and the motive of
      Timour was to join his grandson, who had achieved by his command
      the conquest of Moultan. On the eastern bank of the Hyphasis, on
      the edge of the desert, the Macedonian hero halted and wept: the
      Mogul entered the desert, reduced the fortress of Batmir, and
      stood in arms before the gates of Delhi, a great and flourishing
      city, which had subsisted three centuries under the dominion of
      the Mahometan kings. 251 The siege, more especially of the
      castle, might have been a work of time; but he tempted, by the
      appearance of weakness, the sultan Mahmoud and his vizier to
      descend into the plain, with ten thousand cuirassiers, forty
      thousand of his foot-guards, and one hundred and twenty
      elephants, whose tusks are said to have been armed with sharp and
      poisoned daggers. Against these monsters, or rather against the
      imagination of his troops, he condescended to use some
      extraordinary precautions of fire and a ditch, of iron spikes and
      a rampart of bucklers; but the event taught the Moguls to smile
      at their own fears; and as soon as these unwieldy animals were
      routed, the inferior species (the men of India) disappeared from
      the field. Timour made his triumphal entry into the capital of
      Hindostan; and admired, with a view to imitate, the architecture
      of the stately mosque; but the order or license of a general
      pillage and massacre polluted the festival of his victory. He
      resolved to purify his soldiers in the blood of the idolaters, or
      Gentoos, who still surpass, in the proportion of ten to one, the
      numbers of the Moslems. 252 In this pious design, he advanced one
      hundred miles to the north-east of Delhi, passed the Ganges,
      fought several battles by land and water, and penetrated to the
      famous rock of Coupele, the statue of the cow, 253 that _seems_
      to discharge the mighty river, whose source is far distant among
      the mountains of Thibet. 26 His return was along the skirts of
      the northern hills; nor could this rapid campaign of one year
      justify the strange foresight of his emirs, that their children
      in a warm climate would degenerate into a race of Hindoos.

      It was on the banks of the Ganges that Timour was informed, by
      his speedy messengers, of the disturbances which had arisen on
      the confines of Georgia and Anatolia, of the revolt of the
      Christians, and the ambitious designs of the sultan Bajazet. His
      vigor of mind and body was not impaired by sixty-three years, and
      innumerable fatigues; and, after enjoying some tranquil months in
      the palace of Samarcand, he proclaimed a new expedition of seven
      years into the western countries of Asia. 27 To the soldiers who
      had served in the Indian war he granted the choice of remaining
      at home, or following their prince; but the troops of all the
      provinces and kingdoms of Persia were commanded to assemble at
      Ispahan, and wait the arrival of the Imperial standard. It was
      first directed against the Christians of Georgia, who were strong
      only in their rocks, their castles, and the winter season; but
      these obstacles were overcome by the zeal and perseverance of
      Timour: the rebels submitted to the tribute or the Koran; and if
      both religions boasted of their martyrs, that name is more justly
      due to the Christian prisoners, who were offered the choice of
      abjuration or death. On his descent from the hills, the emperor
      gave audience to the first ambassadors of Bajazet, and opened the
      hostile correspondence of complaints and menaces, which fermented
      two years before the final explosion. Between two jealous and
      haughty neighbors, the motives of quarrel will seldom be wanting.
      The Mogul and Ottoman conquests now touched each other in the
      neighborhood of Erzeroum, and the Euphrates; nor had the doubtful
      limit been ascertained by time and treaty. Each of these
      ambitious monarchs might accuse his rival of violating his
      territory, of threatening his vassals, and protecting his rebels;
      and, by the name of rebels, each understood the fugitive princes,
      whose kingdoms he had usurped, and whose life or liberty he
      implacably pursued. The resemblance of character was still more
      dangerous than the opposition of interest; and in their
      victorious career, Timour was impatient of an equal, and Bajazet
      was ignorant of a superior. The first epistle 28 of the Mogul
      emperor must have provoked, instead of reconciling, the Turkish
      sultan, whose family and nation he affected to despise. 29 “Dost
      thou not know, that the greatest part of Asia is subject to our
      arms and our laws? that our invincible forces extend from one sea
      to the other? that the potentates of the earth form a line before
      our gate? and that we have compelled Fortune herself to watch
      over the prosperity of our empire. What is the foundation of thy
      insolence and folly? Thou hast fought some battles in the woods
      of Anatolia; contemptible trophies! Thou hast obtained some
      victories over the Christians of Europe; thy sword was blessed by
      the apostle of God; and thy obedience to the precept of the
      Koran, in waging war against the infidels, is the sole
      consideration that prevents us from destroying thy country, the
      frontier and bulwark of the Moslem world. Be wise in time;
      reflect; repent; and avert the thunder of our vengeance, which is
      yet suspended over thy head. Thou art no more than a pismire; why
      wilt thou seek to provoke the elephants? Alas! they will trample
      thee under their feet.” In his replies, Bajazet poured forth the
      indignation of a soul which was deeply stung by such unusual
      contempt. After retorting the basest reproaches on the thief and
      rebel of the desert, the Ottoman recapitulates his boasted
      victories in Iran, Touran, and the Indies; and labors to prove,
      that Timour had never triumphed unless by his own perfidy and the
      vices of his foes. “Thy armies are innumerable: be they so; but
      what are the arrows of the flying Tartar against the cimeters and
      battle-axes of my firm and invincible Janizaries? I will guard
      the princes who have implored my protection: seek them in my
      tents. The cities of Arzingan and Erzeroum are mine; and unless
      the tribute be duly paid, I will demand the arrears under the
      walls of Tauris and Sultania.” The ungovernable rage of the
      sultan at length betrayed him to an insult of a more domestic
      kind. “If I fly from thy arms,” said he, “may _my_ wives be
      thrice divorced from my bed: but if thou hast not courage to meet
      me in the field, mayest thou again receive _thy_ wives after they
      have thrice endured the embraces of a stranger.” 30 Any violation
      by word or deed of the secrecy of the harem is an unpardonable
      offence among the Turkish nations; 31 and the political quarrel
      of the two monarchs was imbittered by private and personal
      resentment. Yet in his first expedition, Timour was satisfied
      with the siege and destruction of Siwas or Sebaste, a strong city
      on the borders of Anatolia; and he revenged the indiscretion of
      the Ottoman, on a garrison of four thousand Armenians, who were
      buried alive for the brave and faithful discharge of their duty.
      311 As a Mussulman, he seemed to respect the pious occupation of
      Bajazet, who was still engaged in the blockade of Constantinople;
      and after this salutary lesson, the Mogul conqueror checked his
      pursuit, and turned aside to the invasion of Syria and Egypt. In
      these transactions, the Ottoman prince, by the Orientals, and
      even by Timour, is styled the _Kaissar of Roum_, the Cæsar of the
      Romans; a title which, by a small anticipation, might be given to
      a monarch who possessed the provinces, and threatened the city,
      of the successors of Constantine. 32

      Chapter LXV: Elevation Of Timour Or Tamerlane, And His
      Death.—Part II.

      The military republic of the Mamalukes still reigned in Egypt and
      Syria: but the dynasty of the Turks was overthrown by that of the
      Circassians; 33 and their favorite Barkok, from a slave and a
      prisoner, was raised and restored to the throne. In the midst of
      rebellion and discord, he braved the menaces, corresponded with
      the enemies, and detained the ambassadors, of the Mogul, who
      patiently expected his decease, to revenge the crimes of the
      father on the feeble reign of his son Farage. The Syrian emirs 34
      were assembled at Aleppo to repel the invasion: they confided in
      the fame and discipline of the Mamalukes, in the temper of their
      swords and lances of the purest steel of Damascus, in the
      strength of their walled cities, and in the populousness of sixty
      thousand villages; and instead of sustaining a siege, they threw
      open their gates, and arrayed their forces in the plain. But
      these forces were not cemented by virtue and union; and some
      powerful emirs had been seduced to desert or betray their more
      loyal companions. Timour’s front was covered with a line of
      Indian elephants, whose turrets were filled with archers and
      Greek fire: the rapid evolutions of his cavalry completed the
      dismay and disorder; the Syrian crowds fell back on each other:
      many thousands were stifled or slaughtered in the entrance of the
      great street; the Moguls entered with the fugitives; and after a
      short defence, the citadel, the impregnable citadel of Aleppo,
      was surrendered by cowardice or treachery. Among the suppliants
      and captives, Timour distinguished the doctors of the law, whom
      he invited to the dangerous honor of a personal conference. 35
      The Mogul prince was a zealous Mussulman; but his Persian schools
      had taught him to revere the memory of Ali and Hosein; and he had
      imbibed a deep prejudice against the Syrians, as the enemies of
      the son of the daughter of the apostle of God. To these doctors
      he proposed a captious question, which the casuists of Bochara,
      Samarcand, and Herat, were incapable of resolving. “Who are the
      true martyrs, of those who are slain on my side, or on that of my
      enemies?” But he was silenced, or satisfied, by the dexterity of
      one of the cadhis of Aleppo, who replied in the words of Mahomet
      himself, that the motive, not the ensign, constitutes the martyr;
      and that the Moslems of either party, who fight only for the
      glory of God, may deserve that sacred appellation. The true
      succession of the caliphs was a controversy of a still more
      delicate nature; and the frankness of a doctor, too honest for
      his situation, provoked the emperor to exclaim, “Ye are as false
      as those of Damascus: Moawiyah was a usurper, Yezid a tyrant, and
      Ali alone is the lawful successor of the prophet.” A prudent
      explanation restored his tranquillity; and he passed to a more
      familiar topic of conversation. “What is your age?” said he to
      the cadhi. “Fifty years.”—“It would be the age of my eldest son:
      you see me here (continued Timour) a poor lame, decrepit mortal.
      Yet by my arm has the Almighty been pleased to subdue the
      kingdoms of Iran, Touran, and the Indies. I am not a man of
      blood; and God is my witness, that in all my wars I have never
      been the aggressor, and that my enemies have always been the
      authors of their own calamity.” During this peaceful conversation
      the streets of Aleppo streamed with blood, and reechoed with the
      cries of mothers and children, with the shrieks of violated
      virgins. The rich plunder that was abandoned to his soldiers
      might stimulate their avarice; but their cruelty was enforced by
      the peremptory command of producing an adequate number of heads,
      which, according to his custom, were curiously piled in columns
      and pyramids: the Moguls celebrated the feast of victory, while
      the surviving Moslems passed the night in tears and in chains. I
      shall not dwell on the march of the destroyer from Aleppo to
      Damascus, where he was rudely encountered, and almost overthrown,
      by the armies of Egypt. A retrograde motion was imputed to his
      distress and despair: one of his nephews deserted to the enemy;
      and Syria rejoiced in the tale of his defeat, when the sultan was
      driven by the revolt of the Mamalukes to escape with
      precipitation and shame to his palace of Cairo. Abandoned by
      their prince, the inhabitants of Damascus still defended their
      walls; and Timour consented to raise the siege, if they would
      adorn his retreat with a gift or ransom; each article of nine
      pieces. But no sooner had he introduced himself into the city,
      under color of a truce, than he perfidiously violated the treaty;
      imposed a contribution of ten millions of gold; and animated his
      troops to chastise the posterity of those Syrians who had
      executed, or approved, the murder of the grandson of Mahomet. A
      family which had given honorable burial to the head of Hosein,
      and a colony of artificers, whom he sent to labor at Samarcand,
      were alone reserved in the general massacre, and after a period
      of seven centuries, Damascus was reduced to ashes, because a
      Tartar was moved by religious zeal to avenge the blood of an
      Arab. The losses and fatigues of the campaign obliged Timour to
      renounce the conquest of Palestine and Egypt; but in his return
      to the Euphrates he delivered Aleppo to the flames; and justified
      his pious motive by the pardon and reward of two thousand
      sectaries of Ali, who were desirous to visit the tomb of his son.
      I have expatiated on the personal anecdotes which mark the
      character of the Mogul hero; but I shall briefly mention, 36 that
      he erected on the ruins of Bagdad a pyramid of ninety thousand
      heads; again visited Georgia; encamped on the banks of Araxes;
      and proclaimed his resolution of marching against the Ottoman
      emperor. Conscious of the importance of the war, he collected his
      forces from every province: eight hundred thousand men were
      enrolled on his military list; 37 but the splendid commands of
      five, and ten, thousand horse, may be rather expressive of the
      rank and pension of the chiefs, than of the genuine number of
      effective soldiers. 38 In the pillage of Syria, the Moguls had
      acquired immense riches: but the delivery of their pay and
      arrears for seven years more firmly attached them to the Imperial
      standard.

      34 (return) [ For these recent and domestic transactions,
      Arabshah, though a partial, is a credible, witness, (tom. i. c.
      64—68, tom. ii. c. 1—14.) Timour must have been odious to a
      Syrian; but the notoriety of facts would have obliged him, in
      some measure, to respect his enemy and himself. His bitters may
      correct the luscious sweets of Sherefeddin, (l. v. c. 17—29.)]

      35 (return) [ These interesting conversations appear to have been
      copied by Arabshah (tom. i. c. 68, p. 625—645) from the cadhi and
      historian Ebn Schounah, a principal actor. Yet how could he be
      alive seventy-five years afterwards? (D’Herbelot, p. 792.)]

      36 (return) [ The marches and occupations of Timour between the
      Syrian and Ottoman wars are represented by Sherefeddin (l. v. c.
      29—43) and Arabshah, (tom. ii. c. 15—18.)]

      37 (return) [ This number of 800,000 was extracted by Arabshah,
      or rather by Ebn Schounah, ex rationario Timuri, on the faith of
      a Carizmian officer, (tom. i. c. 68, p. 617;) and it is
      remarkable enough, that a Greek historian (Phranza, l. i. c. 29)
      adds no more than 20,000 men. Poggius reckons 1,000,000; another
      Latin contemporary (Chron. Tarvisianum, apud Muratori, tom. xix.
      p. 800) 1,100,000; and the enormous sum of 1,600,000 is attested
      by a German soldier, who was present at the battle of Angora,
      (Leunclav. ad Chalcondyl. l. iii. p. 82.) Timour, in his
      Institutions, has not deigned to calculate his troops, his
      subjects, or his revenues.]

      38 (return) [ A wide latitude of non-effectives was allowed by
      the Great Mogul for his own pride and the benefit of his
      officers. Bernier’s patron was Penge-Hazari, commander of 5000
      horse; of which he maintained no more than 500, (Voyages, tom. i.
      p. 288, 289.)]

      During this diversion of the Mogul arms, Bajazet had two years to
      collect his forces for a more serious encounter. They consisted
      of four hundred thousand horse and foot, 39 whose merit and
      fidelity were of an unequal complexion. We may discriminate the
      Janizaries, who have been gradually raised to an establishment of
      forty thousand men; a national cavalry, the Spahis of modern
      times; twenty thousand cuirassiers of Europe, clad in black and
      impenetrable armor; the troops of Anatolia, whose princes had
      taken refuge in the camp of Timour, and a colony of Tartars, whom
      he had driven from Kipzak, and to whom Bajazet had assigned a
      settlement in the plains of Adrianople. The fearless confidence
      of the sultan urged him to meet his antagonist; and, as if he had
      chosen that spot for revenge, he displayed his banner near the
      ruins of the unfortunate Suvas. In the mean while, Timour moved
      from the Araxes through the countries of Armenia and Anatolia:
      his boldness was secured by the wisest precautions; his speed was
      guided by order and discipline; and the woods, the mountains, and
      the rivers, were diligently explored by the flying squadrons, who
      marked his road and preceded his standard. Firm in his plan of
      fighting in the heart of the Ottoman kingdom, he avoided their
      camp; dexterously inclined to the left; occupied Cæsarea;
      traversed the salt desert and the River Halys; and invested
      Angora: while the sultan, immovable and ignorant in his post,
      compared the Tartar swiftness to the crawling of a snail; 40 he
      returned on the wings of indignation to the relief of Angora: and
      as both generals were alike impatient for action, the plains
      round that city were the scene of a memorable battle, which has
      immortalized the glory of Timour and the shame of Bajazet. For
      this signal victory the Mogul emperor was indebted to himself, to
      the genius of the moment, and the discipline of thirty years. He
      had improved the tactics, without violating the manners, of his
      nation, 41 whose force still consisted in the missile weapons,
      and rapid evolutions, of a numerous cavalry. From a single troop
      to a great army, the mode of attack was the same: a foremost line
      first advanced to the charge, and was supported in a just order
      by the squadrons of the great vanguard. The general’s eye watched
      over the field, and at his command the front and rear of the
      right and left wings successively moved forwards in their several
      divisions, and in a direct or oblique line: the enemy was pressed
      by eighteen or twenty attacks; and each attack afforded a chance
      of victory. If they all proved fruitless or unsuccessful, the
      occasion was worthy of the emperor himself, who gave the signal
      of advancing to the standard and main body, which he led in
      person. 42 But in the battle of Angora, the main body itself was
      supported, on the flanks and in the rear, by the bravest
      squadrons of the reserve, commanded by the sons and grandsons of
      Timour. The conqueror of Hindostan ostentatiously showed a line
      of elephants, the trophies, rather than the instruments, of
      victory; the use of the Greek fire was familiar to the Moguls and
      Ottomans; but had they borrowed from Europe the recent invention
      of gunpowder and cannon, the artificial thunder, in the hands of
      either nation, must have turned the fortune of the day. 43 In
      that day Bajazet displayed the qualities of a soldier and a
      chief: but his genius sunk under a stronger ascendant; and, from
      various motives, the greatest part of his troops failed him in
      the decisive moment. His rigor and avarice 431 had provoked a
      mutiny among the Turks; and even his son Soliman too hastily
      withdrew from the field. The forces of Anatolia, loyal in their
      revolt, were drawn away to the banners of their lawful princes.
      His Tartar allies had been tempted by the letters and emissaries
      of Timour; 44 who reproached their ignoble servitude under the
      slaves of their fathers; and offered to their hopes the dominion
      of their new, or the liberty of their ancient, country. In the
      right wing of Bajazet the cuirassiers of Europe charged, with
      faithful hearts and irresistible arms: but these men of iron were
      soon broken by an artful flight and headlong pursuit; and the
      Janizaries, alone, without cavalry or missile weapons, were
      encompassed by the circle of the Mogul hunters. Their valor was
      at length oppressed by heat, thirst, and the weight of numbers;
      and the unfortunate sultan, afflicted with the gout in his hands
      and feet, was transported from the field on the fleetest of his
      horses. He was pursued and taken by the titular khan of Zagatai;
      and, after his capture, and the defeat of the Ottoman powers, the
      kingdom of Anatolia submitted to the conqueror, who planted his
      standard at Kiotahia, and dispersed on all sides the ministers of
      rapine and destruction. Mirza Mehemmed Sultan, the eldest and
      best beloved of his grandsons, was despatched to Boursa, with
      thirty thousand horse; and such was his youthful ardor, that he
      arrived with only four thousand at the gates of the capital,
      after performing in five days a march of two hundred and thirty
      miles. Yet fear is still more rapid in its course; and Soliman,
      the son of Bajazet, had already passed over to Europe with the
      royal treasure. The spoil, however, of the palace and city was
      immense: the inhabitants had escaped; but the buildings, for the
      most part of wood, were reduced to ashes. From Boursa, the
      grandson of Timour advanced to Nice, ever yet a fair and
      flourishing city; and the Mogul squadrons were only stopped by
      the waves of the Propontis. The same success attended the other
      mirzas and emirs in their excursions; and Smyrna, defended by the
      zeal and courage of the Rhodian knights, alone deserved the
      presence of the emperor himself. After an obstinate defence, the
      place was taken by storm: all that breathed was put to the sword;
      and the heads of the Christian heroes were launched from the
      engines, on board of two carracks, or great ships of Europe, that
      rode at anchor in the harbor. The Moslems of Asia rejoiced in
      their deliverance from a dangerous and domestic foe; and a
      parallel was drawn between the two rivals, by observing that
      Timour, in fourteen days, had reduced a fortress which had
      sustained seven years the siege, or at least the blockade, of
      Bajazet. 45

      39 (return) [ Timour himself fixes at 400,000 men the Ottoman
      army, (Institutions, p. 153,) which is reduced to 150,000 by

      1,400,000. It is evident that the Moguls were the more numerous.]

      (Annal. Leunclav. p. 321,) and Persian historians, (Khondemir,

      of Timour’s history it is lawful to quote the Turks, (Cantemir,
      p. 53—55, Annal. Leunclav. p. 320—322,) and the Greeks, (Phranza,
      l. i. c. 59, Ducas, c. 15—17, Chalcondyles, l. iii.)]

      The _iron cage_ in which Bajazet was imprisoned by Tamerlane, so
      long and so often repeated as a moral lesson, is now rejected as
      a fable by the modern writers, who smile at the vulgar credulity.
      46 They appeal with confidence to the Persian history of
      Sherefeddin Ali, which has been given to our curiosity in a
      French version, and from which I shall collect and abridge a more
      specious narrative of this memorable transaction. No sooner was
      Timour informed that the captive Ottoman was at the door of his
      tent, than he graciously stepped forwards to receive him, seated
      him by his side, and mingled with just reproaches a soothing pity
      for his rank and misfortune. “Alas!” said the emperor, “the
      decree of fate is now accomplished by your own fault; it is the
      web which you have woven, the thorns of the tree which yourself
      have planted. I wished to spare, and even to assist, the champion
      of the Moslems; you braved our threats; you despised our
      friendship; you forced us to enter your kingdom with our
      invincible armies. Behold the event. Had you vanquished, I am not
      ignorant of the fate which you reserved for myself and my troops.
      But I disdain to retaliate: your life and honor are secure; and I
      shall express my gratitude to God by my clemency to man.” The
      royal captive showed some signs of repentance, accepted the
      humiliation of a robe of honor, and embraced with tears his son
      Mousa, who, at his request, was sought and found among the
      captives of the field. The Ottoman princes were lodged in a
      splendid pavilion; and the respect of the guards could be
      surpassed only by their vigilance. On the arrival of the harem
      from Boursa, Timour restored the queen Despina and her daughter
      to their father and husband; but he piously required, that the
      Servian princess, who had hitherto been indulged in the
      profession of Christianity, should embrace without delay the
      religion of the prophet. In the feast of victory, to which
      Bajazet was invited, the Mogul emperor placed a crown on his head
      and a sceptre in his hand, with a solemn assurance of restoring
      him with an increase of glory to the throne of his ancestors. But
      the effect of his promise was disappointed by the sultan’s
      untimely death: amidst the care of the most skilful physicians,
      he expired of an apoplexy at Akshehr, the Antioch of Pisidia,
      about nine months after his defeat. The victor dropped a tear
      over his grave: his body, with royal pomp, was conveyed to the
      mausoleum which he had erected at Boursa; and his son Mousa,
      after receiving a rich present of gold and jewels, of horses and
      arms, was invested by a patent in red ink with the kingdom of
      Anatolia.

      46 (return) [ The scepticism of Voltaire (Essai sur l’Histoire
      Générale, c. 88) is ready on this, as on every occasion, to
      reject a popular tale, and to diminish the magnitude of vice and
      virtue; and on most occasions his incredulity is reasonable.]

      Such is the portrait of a generous conqueror, which has been
      extracted from his own memorials, and dedicated to his son and
      grandson, nineteen years after his decease; 47 and, at a time
      when the truth was remembered by thousands, a manifest falsehood
      would have implied a satire on his real conduct. Weighty indeed
      is this evidence, adopted by all the Persian histories; 48 yet
      flattery, more especially in the East, is base and audacious; and
      the harsh and ignominious treatment of Bajazet is attested by a
      chain of witnesses, some of whom shall be produced in the order
      of their time and country. _1._ The reader has not forgot the
      garrison of French, whom the marshal Boucicault left behind him
      for the defence of Constantinople. They were on the spot to
      receive the earliest and most faithful intelligence of the
      overthrow of their great adversary; and it is more than probable,
      that some of them accompanied the Greek embassy to the camp of
      Tamerlane. From their account, the _hardships_ of the prison and
      death of Bajazet are affirmed by the marshal’s servant and
      historian, within the distance of seven years. 49 _2._ The name
      of Poggius the Italian 50 is deservedly famous among the revivers
      of learning in the fifteenth century. His elegant dialogue on the
      vicissitudes of fortune 51 was composed in his fiftieth year,
      twenty-eight years after the Turkish victory of Tamerlane; 52
      whom he celebrates as not inferior to the illustrious Barbarians
      of antiquity. Of his exploits and discipline Poggius was informed
      by several ocular witnesses; nor does he forget an example so
      apposite to his theme as the Ottoman monarch, whom the Scythian
      confined like a wild beast in an iron cage, and exhibited a
      spectacle to Asia. I might add the authority of two Italian
      chronicles, perhaps of an earlier date, which would prove at
      least that the same story, whether false or true, was imported
      into Europe with the first tidings of the revolution. 53 _3._ At
      the time when Poggius flourished at Rome, Ahmed Ebn Arabshah
      composed at Damascus the florid and malevolent history of Timour,
      for which he had collected materials in his journeys over Turkey
      and Tartary. 54 Without any possible correspondence between the
      Latin and the Arabian writer, they agree in the fact of the iron
      cage; and their agreement is a striking proof of their common
      veracity. Ahmed Arabshah likewise relates another outrage, which
      Bajazet endured, of a more domestic and tender nature. His
      indiscreet mention of women and divorces was deeply resented by
      the jealous Tartar: in the feast of victory the wine was served
      by female cupbearers, and the sultan beheld his own concubines
      and wives confounded among the slaves, and exposed without a veil
      to the eyes of intemperance. To escape a similar indignity, it is
      said that his successors, except in a single instance, have
      abstained from legitimate nuptials; and the Ottoman practice and
      belief, at least in the sixteenth century, is asserted by the
      observing Busbequius, 55 ambassador from the court of Vienna to
      the great Soliman. _4._ Such is the separation of language, that
      the testimony of a Greek is not less independent than that of a
      Latin or an Arab. I suppress the names of Chalcondyles and Ducas,
      who flourished in the latter period, and who speak in a less
      positive tone; but more attention is due to George Phranza, 56
      protovestiare of the last emperors, and who was born a year
      before the battle of Angora. Twenty-two years after that event,
      he was sent ambassador to Amurath the Second; and the historian
      might converse with some veteran Janizaries, who had been made
      prisoners with the sultan, and had themselves seen him in his
      iron cage. 5. The last evidence, in every sense, is that of the
      Turkish annals, which have been consulted or transcribed by
      Leunclavius, Pocock, and Cantemir. 57 They unanimously deplore
      the captivity of the iron cage; and some credit may be allowed to
      national historians, who cannot stigmatize the Tartar without
      uncovering the shame of their king and country.

      From these opposite premises, a fair and moderate conclusion may
      be deduced. I am satisfied that Sherefeddin Ali has faithfully
      described the first ostentatious interview, in which the
      conqueror, whose spirits were harmonized by success, affected the
      character of generosity. But his mind was insensibly alienated by
      the unseasonable arrogance of Bajazet; the complaints of his
      enemies, the Anatolian princes, were just and vehement; and
      Timour betrayed a design of leading his royal captive in triumph
      to Samarcand. An attempt to facilitate his escape, by digging a
      mine under the tent, provoked the Mogul emperor to impose a
      harsher restraint; and in his perpetual marches, an iron cage on
      a wagon might be invented, not as a wanton insult, but as a
      rigorous precaution. Timour had read in some fabulous history a
      similar treatment of one of his predecessors, a king of Persia;
      and Bajazet was condemned to represent the person, and expiate
      the guilt, of the Roman Cæsar 58 581 But the strength of his mind
      and body fainted under the trial, and his premature death might,
      without injustice, be ascribed to the severity of Timour. He
      warred not with the dead: a tear and a sepulchre were all that he
      could bestow on a captive who was delivered from his power; and
      if Mousa, the son of Bajazet, was permitted to reign over the
      ruins of Boursa, the greatest part of the province of Anatolia
      had been restored by the conqueror to their lawful sovereigns.

      421, vers. Pocock). The recollection of the true history (Decline
      and Fall, &c., vol. ii. p 140—152) will teach us to appreciate
      the knowledge of the Orientals of the ages which precede the
      Hegira.]

      581 (return) [ Von Hammer’s explanation of this contested point
      is both simple and satisfactory. It originates in a mistake in
      the meaning of the Turkish word kafe, which means a covered
      litter or palanquin drawn by two horses, and is generally used to
      convey the harem of an Eastern monarch. In such a litter, with
      the lattice-work made of iron, Bajazet either chose or was
      constrained to travel. This was either mistaken for, or
      transformed by, ignorant relaters into a cage. The European
      Schiltberger, the two oldest of the Turkish historians, and the
      most valuable of the later compilers, Seadeddin, describe this
      litter. Seadeddin discusses the question with some degree of
      historical criticism, and ascribes the choice of such a vehicle
      to the indignant state of Bajazet’s mind, which would not brook
      the sight of his Tartar conquerors. Von Hammer, p. 320.—M.]

      From the Irtish and Volga to the Persian Gulf, and from the
      Ganges to Damascus and the Archipelago, Asia was in the hand of
      Timour: his armies were invincible, his ambition was boundless,
      and his zeal might aspire to conquer and convert the Christian
      kingdoms of the West, which already trembled at his name. He
      touched the utmost verge of the land; but an insuperable, though
      narrow, sea rolled between the two continents of Europe and Asia;
      59 and the lord of so many _tomans_, or myriads, of horse, was
      not master of a single galley. The two passages of the Bosphorus
      and Hellespont, of Constantinople and Gallipoli, were possessed,
      the one by the Christians, the other by the Turks. On this great
      occasion, they forgot the difference of religion, to act with
      union and firmness in the common cause: the double straits were
      guarded with ships and fortifications; and they separately
      withheld the transports which Timour demanded of either nation,
      under the pretence of attacking their enemy. At the same time,
      they soothed his pride with tributary gifts and suppliant
      embassies, and prudently tempted him to retreat with the honors
      of victory. Soliman, the son of Bajazet, implored his clemency
      for his father and himself; accepted, by a red patent, the
      investiture of the kingdom of Romania, which he already held by
      the sword; and reiterated his ardent wish, of casting himself in
      person at the feet of the king of the world. The Greek emperor 60
      (either John or Manuel) submitted to pay the same tribute which
      he had stipulated with the Turkish sultan, and ratified the
      treaty by an oath of allegiance, from which he could absolve his
      conscience so soon as the Mogul arms had retired from Anatolia.
      But the fears and fancy of nations ascribed to the ambitious
      Tamerlane a new design of vast and romantic compass; a design of
      subduing Egypt and Africa, marching from the Nile to the Atlantic
      Ocean, entering Europe by the Straits of Gibraltar, and, after
      imposing his yoke on the kingdoms of Christendom, of returning
      home by the deserts of Russia and Tartary. This remote, and
      perhaps imaginary, danger was averted by the submission of the
      sultan of Egypt: the honors of the prayer and the coin attested
      at Cairo the supremacy of Timour; and a rare gift of a _giraffe_,
      or camelopard, and nine ostriches, represented at Samarcand the
      tribute of the African world. Our imagination is not less
      astonished by the portrait of a Mogul, who, in his camp before
      Smyrna, meditates, and almost accomplishes, the invasion of the
      Chinese empire. 61 Timour was urged to this enterprise by
      national honor and religious zeal. The torrents which he had shed
      of Mussulman blood could be expiated only by an equal destruction
      of the infidels; and as he now stood at the gates of paradise, he
      might best secure his glorious entrance by demolishing the idols
      of China, founding mosques in every city, and establishing the
      profession of faith in one God, and his prophet Mahomet. The
      recent expulsion of the house of Zingis was an insult on the
      Mogul name; and the disorders of the empire afforded the fairest
      opportunity for revenge. The illustrious Hongvou, founder of the
      dynasty of _Ming_, died four years before the battle of Angora;
      and his grandson, a weak and unfortunate youth, was burnt in his
      palace, after a million of Chinese had perished in the civil war.
      62 Before he evacuated Anatolia, Timour despatched beyond the
      Sihoon a numerous army, or rather colony, of his old and new
      subjects, to open the road, to subdue the Pagan Calmucks and
      Mungals, and to found cities and magazines in the desert; and, by
      the diligence of his lieutenant, he soon received a perfect map
      and description of the unknown regions, from the source of the
      Irtish to the wall of China. During these preparations, the
      emperor achieved the final conquest of Georgia; passed the winter
      on the banks of the Araxes; appeased the troubles of Persia; and
      slowly returned to his capital, after a campaign of four years
      and nine months.

      Chapter LXV: Elevation Of Timour Or Tamerlane, And His
      Death.—Part III.

      On the throne of Samarcand, 63 he displayed, in a short repose,
      his magnificence and power; listened to the complaints of the
      people; distributed a just measure of rewards and punishments;
      employed his riches in the architecture of palaces and temples;
      and gave audience to the ambassadors of Egypt, Arabia, India,
      Tartary, Russia, and Spain, the last of whom presented a suit of
      tapestry which eclipsed the pencil of the Oriental artists. The
      marriage of six of the emperor’s grandsons was esteemed an act of
      religion as well as of paternal tenderness; and the pomp of the
      ancient caliphs was revived in their nuptials. They were
      celebrated in the gardens of Canighul, decorated with innumerable
      tents and pavilions, which displayed the luxury of a great city
      and the spoils of a victorious camp. Whole forests were cut down
      to supply fuel for the kitchens; the plain was spread with
      pyramids of meat, and vases of every liquor, to which thousands
      of guests were courteously invited: the orders of the state, and
      the nations of the earth, were marshalled at the royal banquet;
      nor were the ambassadors of Europe (says the haughty Persian)
      excluded from the feast; since even the _casses_, the smallest of
      fish, find their place in the ocean. 64 The public joy was
      testified by illuminations and masquerades; the trades of
      Samarcand passed in review; and every trade was emulous to
      execute some quaint device, some marvellous pageant, with the
      materials of their peculiar art. After the marriage contracts had
      been ratified by the cadhis, the bride-grooms and their brides
      retired to the nuptial chambers: nine times, according to the
      Asiatic fashion, they were dressed and undressed; and at each
      change of apparel, pearls and rubies were showered on their
      heads, and contemptuously abandoned to their attendants. A
      general indulgence was proclaimed: every law was relaxed, every
      pleasure was allowed; the people was free, the sovereign was
      idle; and the historian of Timour may remark, that, after
      devoting fifty years to the attainment of empire, the only happy
      period of his life were the two months in which he ceased to
      exercise his power. But he was soon awakened to the cares of
      government and war. The standard was unfurled for the invasion of
      China: the emirs made their report of two hundred thousand, the
      select and veteran soldiers of Iran and Touran: their baggage and
      provisions were transported by five hundred great wagons, and an
      immense train of horses and camels; and the troops might prepare
      for a long absence, since more than six months were employed in
      the tranquil journey of a caravan from Samarcand to Pekin.
      Neither age, nor the severity of the winter, could retard the
      impatience of Timour; he mounted on horseback, passed the Sihoon
      on the ice, marched seventy-six parasangs, three hundred miles,
      from his capital, and pitched his last camp in the neighborhood
      of Otrar, where he was expected by the angel of death. Fatigue,
      and the indiscreet use of iced water, accelerated the progress of
      his fever; and the conqueror of Asia expired in the seventieth
      year of his age, thirty-five years after he had ascended the
      throne of Zagatai. His designs were lost; his armies were
      disbanded; China was saved; and fourteen years after his decease,
      the most powerful of his children sent an embassy of friendship
      and commerce to the court of Pekin. 65

      64 (return) [ Sherefeddin (l. vi. c. 24) mentions the ambassadors
      of one of the most potent sovereigns of Europe. We know that it
      was Henry III. king of Castile; and the curious relation of his
      two embassies is still extant, (Mariana, Hist. Hispan. l. xix. c.
      11, tom. ii. p. 329, 330. Avertissement à l’Hist. de Timur Bec,
      p. 28—33.) There appears likewise to have been some
      correspondence between the Mogul emperor and the court of Charles
      VII. king of France, (Histoire de France, par Velly et Villaret,
      tom. xii. p. 336.)]

      65 (return) [ See the translation of the Persian account of their
      embassy, a curious and original piece, (in the ivth part of the
      Relations de Thevenot.) They presented the emperor of China with
      an old horse which Timour had formerly rode. It was in the year
      1419 that they departed from the court of Herat, to which place
      they returned in 1422 from Pekin.]

      The fame of Timour has pervaded the East and West: his posterity
      is still invested with the Imperial _title_; and the admiration
      of his subjects, who revered him almost as a deity, may be
      justified in some degree by the praise or confession of his
      bitterest enemies. 66 Although he was lame of a hand and foot,
      his form and stature were not unworthy of his rank; and his
      vigorous health, so essential to himself and to the world, was
      corroborated by temperance and exercise. In his familiar
      discourse he was grave and modest, and if he was ignorant of the
      Arabic language, he spoke with fluency and elegance the Persian
      and Turkish idioms. It was his delight to converse with the
      learned on topics of history and science; and the amusement of
      his leisure hours was the game of chess, which he improved or
      corrupted with new refinements. 67 In his religion he was a
      zealous, though not perhaps an orthodox, Mussulman; 68 but his
      sound understanding may tempt us to believe, that a superstitious
      reverence for omens and prophecies, for saints and astrologers,
      was only affected as an instrument of policy. In the government
      of a vast empire, he stood alone and absolute, without a rebel to
      oppose his power, a favorite to seduce his affections, or a
      minister to mislead his judgment. It was his firmest maxim, that
      whatever might be the consequence, the word of the prince should
      never be disputed or recalled; but his foes have maliciously
      observed, that the commands of anger and destruction were more
      strictly executed than those of beneficence and favor. His sons
      and grandsons, of whom Timour left six-and-thirty at his decease,
      were his first and most submissive subjects; and whenever they
      deviated from their duty, they were corrected, according to the
      laws of Zingis, with the bastinade, and afterwards restored to
      honor and command. Perhaps his heart was not devoid of the social
      virtues; perhaps he was not incapable of loving his friends and
      pardoning his enemies; but the rules of morality are founded on
      the public interest; and it may be sufficient to applaud the
      _wisdom_ of a monarch, for the liberality by which he is not
      impoverished, and for the justice by which he is strengthened and
      enriched. To maintain the harmony of authority and obedience, to
      chastise the proud, to protect the weak, to reward the deserving,
      to banish vice and idleness from his dominions, to secure the
      traveller and merchant, to restrain the depredations of the
      soldier, to cherish the labors of the husbandman, to encourage
      industry and learning, and, by an equal and moderate assessment,
      to increase the revenue, without increasing the taxes, are indeed
      the duties of a prince; but, in the discharge of these duties, he
      finds an ample and immediate recompense. Timour might boast,
      that, at his accession to the throne, Asia was the prey of
      anarchy and rapine, whilst under his prosperous monarchy a child,
      fearless and unhurt, might carry a purse of gold from the East to
      the West. Such was his confidence of merit, that from this
      reformation he derived an excuse for his victories, and a title
      to universal dominion. The four following observations will serve
      to appreciate his claim to the public gratitude; and perhaps we
      shall conclude, that the Mogul emperor was rather the scourge
      than the benefactor of mankind. _1._ If some partial disorders,
      some local oppressions, were healed by the sword of Timour, the
      remedy was far more pernicious than the disease. By their rapine,
      cruelty, and discord, the petty tyrants of Persia might afflict
      their subjects; but whole nations were crushed under the
      footsteps of the reformer. The ground which had been occupied by
      flourishing cities was often marked by his abominable trophies,
      by columns, or pyramids, of human heads. Astracan, Carizme,
      Delhi, Ispahan, Bagdad, Aleppo, Damascus, Boursa, Smyrna, and a
      thousand others, were sacked, or burnt, or utterly destroyed, in
      his presence, and by his troops: and perhaps his conscience would
      have been startled, if a priest or philosopher had dared to
      number the millions of victims whom he had sacrificed to the
      establishment of peace and order. 69 _2._ His most destructive
      wars were rather inroads than conquests. He invaded Turkestan,
      Kipzak, Russia, Hindostan, Syria, Anatolia, Armenia, and Georgia,
      without a hope or a desire of preserving those distant provinces.
      From thence he departed laden with spoil; but he left behind him
      neither troops to awe the contumacious, nor magistrates to
      protect the obedient, natives. When he had broken the fabric of
      their ancient government, he abandoned them to the evils which
      his invasion had aggravated or caused; nor were these evils
      compensated by any present or possible benefits. _3._ The
      kingdoms of Transoxiana and Persia were the proper field which he
      labored to cultivate and adorn, as the perpetual inheritance of
      his family. But his peaceful labors were often interrupted, and
      sometimes blasted, by the absence of the conqueror. While he
      triumphed on the Volga or the Ganges, his servants, and even his
      sons, forgot their master and their duty. The public and private
      injuries were poorly redressed by the tardy rigor of inquiry and
      punishment; and we must be content to praise the _Institutions_
      of Timour, as the specious idea of a perfect monarchy. _4._
      Whatsoever might be the blessings of his administration, they
      evaporated with his life. To reign, rather than to govern, was
      the ambition of his children and grandchildren; 70 the enemies of
      each other and of the people. A fragment of the empire was upheld
      with some glory by Sharokh, his youngest son; but after _his_
      decease, the scene was again involved in darkness and blood; and
      before the end of a century, Transoxiana and Persia were trampled
      by the Uzbeks from the north, and the Turkmans of the black and
      white sheep. The race of Timour would have been extinct, if a
      hero, his descendant in the fifth degree, had not fled before the
      Uzbek arms to the conquest of Hindostan. His successors (the
      great Moguls 71) extended their sway from the mountains of
      Cashmir to Cape Comorin, and from Candahar to the Gulf of Bengal.
      Since the reign of Aurungzebe, their empire had been dissolved;
      their treasures of Delhi have been rifled by a Persian robber;
      and the richest of their kingdoms is now possessed by a company
      of Christian merchants, of a remote island in the Northern Ocean.

      Far different was the fate of the Ottoman monarchy. The massy
      trunk was bent to the ground, but no sooner did the hurricane
      pass away, than it again rose with fresh vigor and more lively
      vegetation. When Timour, in every sense, had evacuated Anatolia,
      he left the cities without a palace, a treasure, or a king. The
      open country was overspread with hordes of shepherds and robbers
      of Tartar or Turkman origin; the recent conquests of Bajazet were
      restored to the emirs, one of whom, in base revenge, demolished
      his sepulchre; and his five sons were eager, by civil discord, to
      consume the remnant of their patrimony. I shall enumerate their
      names in the order of their age and actions. 72 _1._ It is
      doubtful, whether I relate the story of the true _Mustapha_, or
      of an impostor who personated that lost prince. He fought by his
      father’s side in the battle of Angora: but when the captive
      sultan was permitted to inquire for his children, Mousa alone
      could be found; and the Turkish historians, the slaves of the
      triumphant faction, are persuaded that his brother was confounded
      among the slain. If Mustapha escaped from that disastrous field,
      he was concealed twelve years from his friends and enemies; till
      he emerged in Thessaly, and was hailed by a numerous party, as
      the son and successor of Bajazet. His first defeat would have
      been his last, had not the true, or false, Mustapha been saved by
      the Greeks, and restored, after the decease of his brother
      Mahomet, to liberty and empire. A degenerate mind seemed to argue
      his spurious birth; and if, on the throne of Adrianople, he was
      adored as the Ottoman sultan, his flight, his fetters, and an
      ignominious gibbet, delivered the impostor to popular contempt. A
      similar character and claim was asserted by several rival
      pretenders: thirty persons are said to have suffered under the
      name of Mustapha; and these frequent executions may perhaps
      insinuate, that the Turkish court was not perfectly secure of the
      death of the lawful prince. _2._ After his father’s captivity,
      Isa 73 reigned for some time in the neighborhood of Angora,
      Sinope, and the Black Sea; and his ambassadors were dismissed
      from the presence of Timour with fair promises and honorable
      gifts. But their master was soon deprived of his province and
      life, by a jealous brother, the sovereign of Amasia; and the
      final event suggested a pious allusion, that the law of Moses and
      Jesus, of _Isa_ and _Mousa_, had been abrogated by the greater
      Mahomet. _3._ _Soliman_ is not numbered in the list of the
      Turkish emperors: yet he checked the victorious progress of the
      Moguls; and after their departure, united for a while the thrones
      of Adrianople and Boursa. In war he was brave, active, and
      fortunate; his courage was softened by clemency; but it was
      likewise inflamed by presumption, and corrupted by intemperance
      and idleness. He relaxed the nerves of discipline, in a
      government where either the subject or the sovereign must
      continually tremble: his vices alienated the chiefs of the army
      and the law; and his daily drunkenness, so contemptible in a
      prince and a man, was doubly odious in a disciple of the prophet.
      In the slumber of intoxication he was surprised by his brother
      Mousa; and as he fled from Adrianople towards the Byzantine
      capital, Soliman was overtaken and slain in a bath, 731 after a
      reign of seven years and ten months. _4._ The investiture of
      Mousa degraded him as the slave of the Moguls: his tributary
      kingdom of Anatolia was confined within a narrow limit, nor could
      his broken militia and empty treasury contend with the hardy and
      veteran bands of the sovereign of Romania. Mousa fled in disguise
      from the palace of Boursa; traversed the Propontis in an open
      boat; wandered over the Walachian and Servian hills; and after
      some vain attempts, ascended the throne of Adrianople, so
      recently stained with the blood of Soliman. In a reign of three
      years and a half, his troops were victorious against the
      Christians of Hungary and the Morea; but Mousa was ruined by his
      timorous disposition and unseasonable clemency. After resigning
      the sovereignty of Anatolia, he fell a victim to the perfidy of
      his ministers, and the superior ascendant of his brother Mahomet.
      _5._The final victory of Mahomet was the just recompense of his
      prudence and moderation. Before his father’s captivity, the royal
      youth had been intrusted with the government of Amasia, thirty
      days’ journey from Constantinople, and the Turkish frontier
      against the Christians of Trebizond and Georgia. The castle, in
      Asiatic warfare, was esteemed impregnable; and the city of
      Amasia, 74 which is equally divided by the River Iris, rises on
      either side in the form of an amphitheatre, and represents on a
      smaller scale the image of Bagdad. In his rapid career, Timour
      appears to have overlooked this obscure and contumacious angle of
      Anatolia; and Mahomet, without provoking the conqueror,
      maintained his silent independence, and chased from the province
      the last stragglers of the Tartar host. 741 He relieved himself
      from the dangerous neighborhood of Isa; but in the contests of
      their more powerful brethren his firm neutrality was respected;
      till, after the triumph of Mousa, he stood forth the heir and
      avenger of the unfortunate Soliman. Mahomet obtained Anatolia by
      treaty, and Romania by arms; and the soldier who presented him
      with the head of Mousa was rewarded as the benefactor of his king
      and country. The eight years of his sole and peaceful reign were
      usefully employed in banishing the vices of civil discord, and
      restoring on a firmer basis the fabric of the Ottoman monarchy.
      His last care was the choice of two viziers, Bajazet and Ibrahim,
      75 who might guide the youth of his son Amurath; and such was
      their union and prudence, that they concealed above forty days
      the emperor’s death, till the arrival of his successor in the
      palace of Boursa. A new war was kindled in Europe by the prince,
      or impostor, Mustapha; the first vizier lost his army and his

      receive two annual visits from the sultan, (Cantemir, p. 76.)]

      In these conflicts, the wisest Turks, and indeed the body of the
      nation, were strongly attached to the unity of the empire; and
      Romania and Anatolia, so often torn asunder by private ambition,
      were animated by a strong and invincible tendency of cohesion.
      Their efforts might have instructed the Christian powers; and had
      they occupied, with a confederate fleet, the Straits of
      Gallipoli, the Ottomans, at least in Europe, must have been
      speedily annihilated. But the schism of the West, and the
      factions and wars of France and England, diverted the Latins from
      this generous enterprise: they enjoyed the present respite,
      without a thought of futurity; and were often tempted by a
      momentary interest to serve the common enemy of their religion. A
      colony of Genoese, 76 which had been planted at Phocæa 77 on the
      Ionian coast, was enriched by the lucrative monopoly of alum; 78
      and their tranquillity, under the Turkish empire, was secured by
      the annual payment of tribute. In the last civil war of the
      Ottomans, the Genoese governor, Adorno, a bold and ambitious
      youth, embraced the party of Amurath; and undertook, with seven
      stout galleys, to transport him from Asia to Europe. The sultan
      and five hundred guards embarked on board the admiral’s ship;
      which was manned by eight hundred of the bravest Franks. His life
      and liberty were in their hands; nor can we, without reluctance,
      applaud the fidelity of Adorno, who, in the midst of the passage,
      knelt before him, and gratefully accepted a discharge of his
      arrears of tribute. They landed in sight of Mustapha and
      Gallipoli; two thousand Italians, armed with lances and
      battle-axes, attended Amurath to the conquest of Adrianople; and
      this venal service was soon repaid by the ruin of the commerce
      and colony of Phocæa.

      described by Tournefort, (tom. i. lettre iv.,) a traveller and a
      naturalist. After the loss of Phocæa, the Genoese, in 1459, found
      that useful mineral in the Isle of Ischia, (Ismael. Bouillaud, ad
      Ducam, c. 25.)]

      If Timour had generously marched at the request, and to the
      relief, of the Greek emperor, he might be entitled to the praise
      and gratitude of the Christians. 79 But a Mussulman, who carried
      into Georgia the sword of persecution, and respected the holy
      warfare of Bajazet, was not disposed to pity or succor the
      _idolaters_ of Europe. The Tartar followed the impulse of
      ambition; and the deliverance of Constantinople was the
      accidental consequence. When Manuel abdicated the government, it
      was his prayer, rather than his hope, that the ruin of the church
      and state might be delayed beyond his unhappy days; and after his
      return from a western pilgrimage, he expected every hour the news
      of the sad catastrophe. On a sudden, he was astonished and
      rejoiced by the intelligence of the retreat, the overthrow, and
      the captivity of the Ottoman. Manuel 80 immediately sailed from
      Modon in the Morea; ascended the throne of Constantinople, and
      dismissed his blind competitor to an easy exile in the Isle of
      Lesbos. The ambassadors of the son of Bajazet were soon
      introduced to his presence; but their pride was fallen, their
      tone was modest: they were awed by the just apprehension, lest
      the Greeks should open to the Moguls the gates of Europe. Soliman
      saluted the emperor by the name of father; solicited at his hands
      the government or gift of Romania; and promised to deserve his
      favor by inviolable friendship, and the restitution of
      Thessalonica, with the most important places along the Strymon,
      the Propontis, and the Black Sea. The alliance of Soliman exposed
      the emperor to the enmity and revenge of Mousa: the Turks
      appeared in arms before the gates of Constantinople; but they
      were repulsed by sea and land; and unless the city was guarded by
      some foreign mercenaries, the Greeks must have wondered at their
      own triumph. But, instead of prolonging the division of the
      Ottoman powers, the policy or passion of Manuel was tempted to
      assist the most formidable of the sons of Bajazet. He concluded a
      treaty with Mahomet, whose progress was checked by the
      insuperable barrier of Gallipoli: the sultan and his troops were
      transported over the Bosphorus; he was hospitably entertained in
      the capital; and his successful sally was the first step to the
      conquest of Romania. The ruin was suspended by the prudence and
      moderation of the conqueror: he faithfully discharged his own
      obligations and those of Soliman, respected the laws of gratitude
      and peace; and left the emperor guardian of his two younger sons,
      in the vain hope of saving them from the jealous cruelty of their
      brother Amurath. But the execution of his last testament would
      have offended the national honor and religion; and the divan
      unanimously pronounced, that the royal youths should never be
      abandoned to the custody and education of a Christian dog. On
      this refusal, the Byzantine councils were divided; but the age
      and caution of Manuel yielded to the presumption of his son John;
      and they unsheathed a dangerous weapon of revenge, by dismissing
      the true or false Mustapha, who had long been detained as a
      captive and hostage, and for whose maintenance they received an
      annual pension of three hundred thousand aspers. 81 At the door
      of his prison, Mustapha subscribed to every proposal; and the
      keys of Gallipoli, or rather of Europe, were stipulated as the
      price of his deliverance. But no sooner was he seated on the
      throne of Romania, than he dismissed the Greek ambassadors with a
      smile of contempt, declaring, in a pious tone, that, at the day
      of judgment, he would rather answer for the violation of an oath,
      than for the surrender of a Mussulman city into the hands of the
      infidels. The emperor was at once the enemy of the two rivals;
      from whom he had sustained, and to whom he had offered, an
      injury; and the victory of Amurath was followed, in the ensuing
      spring, by the siege of Constantinople. 82

      The religious merit of subduing the city of the Cæsars attracted
      from Asia a crowd of volunteers, who aspired to the crown of
      martyrdom: their military ardor was inflamed by the promise of
      rich spoils and beautiful females; and the sultan’s ambition was
      consecrated by the presence and prediction of Seid Bechar, a
      descendant of the prophet, 83 who arrived in the camp, on a mule,
      with a venerable train of five hundred disciples. But he might
      blush, if a fanatic could blush, at the failure of his
      assurances. The strength of the walls resisted an army of two
      hundred thousand Turks; their assaults were repelled by the
      sallies of the Greeks and their foreign mercenaries; the old
      resources of defence were opposed to the new engines of attack;
      and the enthusiasm of the dervis, who was snatched to heaven in
      visionary converse with Mahomet, was answered by the credulity of
      the Christians, who _beheld_ the Virgin Mary, in a violet
      garment, walking on the rampart and animating their courage. 84
      After a siege of two months, Amurath was recalled to Boursa by a
      domestic revolt, which had been kindled by Greek treachery, and
      was soon extinguished by the death of a guiltless brother. While
      he led his Janizaries to new conquests in Europe and Asia, the
      Byzantine empire was indulged in a servile and precarious respite
      of thirty years. Manuel sank into the grave; and John Palæologus
      was permitted to reign, for an annual tribute of three hundred
      thousand aspers, and the dereliction of almost all that he held
      beyond the suburbs of Constantinople.

      83 (return) [ Cantemir, p. 80. Cananus, who describes Seid
      Bechar, without naming him, supposes that the friend of Mahomet

      disciples.]

      In the establishment and restoration of the Turkish empire, the
      first merit must doubtless be assigned to the personal qualities
      of the sultans; since, in human life, the most important scenes
      will depend on the character of a single actor. By some shades of
      wisdom and virtue, they may be discriminated from each other;
      but, except in a single instance, a period of nine reigns, and
      two hundred and sixty-five years, is occupied, from the elevation
      of Othman to the death of Soliman, by a rare series of warlike
      and active princes, who impressed their subjects with obedience
      and their enemies with terror. Instead of the slothful luxury of
      the seraglio, the heirs of royalty were educated in the council
      and the field: from early youth they were intrusted by their
      fathers with the command of provinces and armies; and this manly
      institution, which was often productive of civil war, must have
      essentially contributed to the discipline and vigor of the
      monarchy. The Ottomans cannot style themselves, like the Arabian
      caliphs, the descendants or successors of the apostle of God; and
      the kindred which they claim with the Tartar khans of the house
      of Zingis appears to be founded in flattery rather than in truth.
      85 Their origin is obscure; but their sacred and indefeasible
      right, which no time can erase, and no violence can infringe, was
      soon and unalterably implanted in the minds of their subjects. A
      weak or vicious sultan may be deposed and strangled; but his
      inheritance devolves to an infant or an idiot: nor has the most
      daring rebel presumed to ascend the throne of his lawful
      sovereign. 86

      86 (return) [ The third grand vizier of the name of Kiuperli, who
      was slain at the battle of Salankanen in 1691, (Cantemir, p.
      382,) presumed to say that all the successors of Soliman had been
      fools or tyrants, and that it was time to abolish the race,
      (Marsigli Stato Militaire, &c., p. 28.) This political heretic
      was a good Whig, and justified against the French ambassador the
      revolution of England, (Mignot, Hist. des Ottomans, tom. iii. p.
      434.) His presumption condemns the singular exception of
      continuing offices in the same family.]

      While the transient dynasties of Asia have been continually
      subverted by a crafty vizier in the palace, or a victorious
      general in the camp, the Ottoman succession has been confirmed by
      the practice of five centuries, and is now incorporated with the
      vital principle of the Turkish nation.

      To the spirit and constitution of that nation, a strong and
      singular influence may, however, be ascribed. The primitive
      subjects of Othman were the four hundred families of wandering
      Turkmans, who had followed his ancestors from the Oxus to the
      Sangar; and the plains of Anatolia are still covered with the
      white and black tents of their rustic brethren. But this original
      drop was dissolved in the mass of voluntary and vanquished
      subjects, who, under the name of Turks, are united by the common
      ties of religion, language, and manners. In the cities, from
      Erzeroum to Belgrade, that national appellation is common to all
      the Moslems, the first and most honorable inhabitants; but they
      have abandoned, at least in Romania, the villages, and the
      cultivation of the land, to the Christian peasants. In the
      vigorous age of the Ottoman government, the Turks were themselves
      excluded from all civil and military honors; and a servile class,
      an artificial people, was raised by the discipline of education
      to obey, to conquer, and to command. 87 From the time of Orchan
      and the first Amurath, the sultans were persuaded that a
      government of the sword must be renewed in each generation with
      new soldiers; and that such soldiers must be sought, not in
      effeminate Asia, but among the hardy and warlike natives of
      Europe. The provinces of Thrace, Macedonia, Albania, Bulgaria,
      and Servia, became the perpetual seminary of the Turkish army;
      and when the royal fifth of the captives was diminished by
      conquest, an inhuman tax of the fifth child, or of every fifth
      year, was rigorously levied on the Christian families. At the age
      of twelve or fourteen years, the most robust youths were torn
      from their parents; their names were enrolled in a book; and from
      that moment they were clothed, taught, and maintained, for the
      public service. According to the promise of their appearance,
      they were selected for the royal schools of Boursa, Pera, and
      Adrianople, intrusted to the care of the bashaws, or dispersed in
      the houses of the Anatolian peasantry. It was the first care of
      their masters to instruct them in the Turkish language: their
      bodies were exercised by every labor that could fortify their
      strength; they learned to wrestle, to leap, to run, to shoot with
      the bow, and afterwards with the musket; till they were drafted
      into the chambers and companies of the Janizaries, and severely
      trained in the military or monastic discipline of the order. The
      youths most conspicuous for birth, talents, and beauty, were
      admitted into the inferior class of _Agiamoglans_, or the more
      liberal rank of _Ichoglans_, of whom the former were attached to
      the palace, and the latter to the person, of the prince. In four
      successive schools, under the rod of the white eunuchs, the arts
      of horsemanship and of darting the javelin were their daily
      exercise, while those of a more studious cast applied themselves
      to the study of the Koran, and the knowledge of the Arabic and
      Persian tongues. As they advanced in seniority and merit, they
      were gradually dismissed to military, civil, and even
      ecclesiastical employments: the longer their stay, the higher was
      their expectation; till, at a mature period, they were admitted
      into the number of the forty agas, who stood before the sultan,
      and were promoted by his choice to the government of provinces
      and the first honors of the empire. 88 Such a mode of institution
      was admirably adapted to the form and spirit of a despotic
      monarchy. The ministers and generals were, in the strictest
      sense, the slaves of the emperor, to whose bounty they were
      indebted for their instruction and support. When they left the
      seraglio, and suffered their beards to grow as the symbol of
      enfranchisement, they found themselves in an important office,
      without faction or friendship, without parents and without heirs,
      dependent on the hand which had raised them from the dust, and
      which, on the slightest displeasure, could break in pieces these
      statues of glass, as they were aptly termed by the Turkish
      proverb. 89 In the slow and painful steps of education, their
      characters and talents were unfolded to a discerning eye: the
      _man_, naked and alone, was reduced to the standard of his
      personal merit; and, if the sovereign had wisdom to choose, he
      possessed a pure and boundless liberty of choice. The Ottoman
      candidates were trained by the virtues of abstinence to those of
      action; by the habits of submission to those of command. A
      similar spirit was diffused among the troops; and their silence
      and sobriety, their patience and modesty, have extorted the
      reluctant praise of their Christian enemies. 90 Nor can the
      victory appear doubtful, if we compare the discipline and
      exercise of the Janizaries with the pride of birth, the
      independence of chivalry, the ignorance of the new levies, the
      mutinous temper of the veterans, and the vices of intemperance
      and disorder, which so long contaminated the armies of Europe.

      The only hope of salvation for the Greek empire, and the adjacent
      kingdoms, would have been some more powerful weapon, some
      discovery in the art of war, that would give them a decisive
      superiority over their Turkish foes. Such a weapon was in their
      hands; such a discovery had been made in the critical moment of
      their fate. The chemists of China or Europe had found, by casual
      or elaborate experiments, that a mixture of saltpetre, sulphur,
      and charcoal, produces, with a spark of fire, a tremendous
      explosion. It was soon observed, that if the expansive force were
      compressed in a strong tube, a ball of stone or iron might be
      expelled with irresistible and destructive velocity. The precise
      æra of the invention and application of gunpowder 91 is involved
      in doubtful traditions and equivocal language; yet we may clearly
      discern, that it was known before the middle of the fourteenth
      century; and that before the end of the same, the use of
      artillery in battles and sieges, by sea and land, was familiar to
      the states of Germany, Italy, Spain, France, and England. 92 The
      priority of nations is of small account; none could derive any
      exclusive benefit from their previous or superior knowledge; and
      in the common improvement, they stood on the same level of
      relative power and military science. Nor was it possible to
      circumscribe the secret within the pale of the church; it was
      disclosed to the Turks by the treachery of apostates and the
      selfish policy of rivals; and the sultans had sense to adopt, and
      wealth to reward, the talents of a Christian engineer. The
      Genoese, who transported Amurath into Europe, must be accused as
      his preceptors; and it was probably by their hands that his
      cannon was cast and directed at the siege of Constantinople. 93
      The first attempt was indeed unsuccessful; but in the general
      warfare of the age, the advantage was on _their_ side, who were
      most commonly the assailants: for a while the proportion of the
      attack and defence was suspended; and this thundering artillery
      was pointed against the walls and towers which had been erected
      only to resist the less potent engines of antiquity. By the
      Venetians, the use of gunpowder was communicated without reproach
      to the sultans of Egypt and Persia, their allies against the
      Ottoman power; the secret was soon propagated to the extremities
      of Asia; and the advantage of the European was confined to his
      easy victories over the savages of the new world. If we contrast
      the rapid progress of this mischievous discovery with the slow
      and laborious advances of reason, science, and the arts of peace,
      a philosopher, according to his temper, will laugh or weep at the
      folly of mankind.

      _our_ artillery, may be fairly interpreted of the old engines and
      the Greek fire. For the English cannon at Crecy, the authority of
      John Villani (Chron. l. xii. c. 65) must be weighed against the
      silence of Froissard. Yet Muratori (Antiquit. Italiæ Medii Ævi,

      positive testimony of Villani, who died within two years
      afterwards, and had manifestly obtained much information as to
      the great events passing in France, cannot be rejected. He
      ascribes a material effect to the cannon of Edward, Colpi delle
      bombarde, which I suspect, from his strong expressions, had not
      been employed before, except against stone walls. It seems, he
      says, as if God thundered con grande uccisione di genti e
      efondamento di cavalli.” Middle Ages, vol. i. p. 510.—M.]

      introduces before Belgrade, (A.D. 1436,) is mentioned by
      Chalcondyles (l. v. p. 123) in 1422, at the siege of
      Constantinople.]
