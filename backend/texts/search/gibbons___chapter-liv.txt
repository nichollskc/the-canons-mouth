Chapter LIV: Origin And Doctrine Of The Paulicians.—Part I.

     Origin And Doctrine Of The Paulicians.—Their Persecution By The
     Greek Emperors.—Revolt In Armenia &c.—Transplantation Into
     Thrace.—Propagation In The West.—The Seeds, Character, And
     Consequences Of The Reformation.

      In the profession of Christianity, the variety of national
      characters may be clearly distinguished. The natives of Syria and
      Egypt abandoned their lives to lazy and contemplative devotion:
      Rome again aspired to the dominion of the world; and the wit of
      the lively and loquacious Greeks was consumed in the disputes of
      metaphysical theology. The incomprehensible mysteries of the
      Trinity and Incarnation, instead of commanding their silent
      submission, were agitated in vehement and subtile controversies,
      which enlarged their faith at the expense, perhaps, of their
      charity and reason. From the council of Nice to the end of the
      seventh century, the peace and unity of the church was invaded by
      these spiritual wars; and so deeply did they affect the decline
      and fall of the empire, that the historian has too often been
      compelled to attend the synods, to explore the creeds, and to
      enumerate the sects, of this busy period of ecclesiastical
      annals. From the beginning of the eighth century to the last ages
      of the Byzantine empire, the sound of controversy was seldom
      heard: curiosity was exhausted, zeal was fatigued, and, in the
      decrees of six councils, the articles of the Catholic faith had
      been irrevocably defined. The spirit of dispute, however vain and
      pernicious, requires some energy and exercise of the mental
      faculties; and the prostrate Greeks were content to fast, to
      pray, and to believe in blind obedience to the patriarch and his
      clergy. During a long dream of superstition, the Virgin and the
      Saints, their visions and miracles, their relics and images, were
      preached by the monks, and worshipped by the people; and the
      appellation of people might be extended, without injustice, to
      the first ranks of civil society. At an unseasonable moment, the
      Isaurian emperors attempted somewhat rudely to awaken their
      subjects: under their influence reason might obtain some
      proselytes, a far greater number was swayed by interest or fear;
      but the Eastern world embraced or deplored their visible deities,
      and the restoration of images was celebrated as the feast of
      orthodoxy. In this passive and unanimous state the ecclesiastical
      rulers were relieved from the toil, or deprived of the pleasure,
      of persecution. The Pagans had disappeared; the Jews were silent
      and obscure; the disputes with the Latins were rare and remote
      hostilities against a national enemy; and the sects of Egypt and
      Syria enjoyed a free toleration under the shadow of the Arabian
      caliphs. About the middle of the seventh century, a branch of
      Manichaeans was selected as the victims of spiritual tyranny;
      their patience was at length exasperated to despair and
      rebellion; and their exile has scattered over the West the seeds
      of reformation. These important events will justify some inquiry
      into the doctrine and story of the Paulicians; 1 and, as they
      cannot plead for themselves, our candid criticism will magnify
      the good, and abate or suspect the evil, that is reported by
      their adversaries.

      1 (return) [ The errors and virtues of the Paulicians are
      weighed, with his usual judgment and candor, by the learned
      Mosheim, (Hist. Ecclesiast. seculum ix. p. 311, &c.) He draws his
      original intelligence from Photius (contra Manichaeos, l. i.) and
      Peter Siculus, (Hist. Manichaeorum.) The first of these accounts
      has not fallen into my hands; the second, which Mosheim prefers,
      I have read in a Latin version inserted in the Maxima Bibliotheca
      Patrum, (tom. xvi. p. 754-764,) from the edition of the Jesuit
      Raderus, (Ingolstadii, 1604, in 4to.) * Note: Compare Hallam’s
      Middle Ages, p. 461-471. Mr. Hallam justly observes that this
      chapter “appears to be accurate as well as luminous, and is at
      least far superior to any modern work on the subject.”—M.]

      The Gnostics, who had distracted the infancy, were oppressed by
      the greatness and authority, of the church. Instead of emulating
      or surpassing the wealth, learning, and numbers of the Catholics,
      their obscure remnant was driven from the capitals of the East
      and West, and confined to the villages and mountains along the
      borders of the Euphrates. Some vestige of the Marcionites may be
      detected in the fifth century; 2 but the numerous sects were
      finally lost in the odious name of the Manichaeans; and these
      heretics, who presumed to reconcile the doctrines of Zoroaster
      and Christ, were pursued by the two religions with equal and
      unrelenting hatred. Under the grandson of Heraclius, in the
      neighborhood of Samosata, more famous for the birth of Lucian
      than for the title of a Syrian kingdom, a reformer arose,
      esteemed by the Paulicians as the chosen messenger of truth. In
      his humble dwelling of Mananalis, Constantine entertained a
      deacon, who returned from Syrian captivity, and received the
      inestimable gift of the New Testament, which was already
      concealed from the vulgar by the prudence of the Greek, and
      perhaps of the Gnostic, clergy. 3 These books became the measure
      of his studies and the rule of his faith; and the Catholics, who
      dispute his interpretation, acknowledge that his text was genuine
      and sincere. But he attached himself with peculiar devotion to
      the writings and character of St. Paul: the name of the
      Paulicians is derived by their enemies from some unknown and
      domestic teacher; but I am confident that they gloried in their
      affinity to the apostle of the Gentiles. His disciples, Titus,
      Timothy, Sylvanus, Tychicus, were represented by Constantine and
      his fellow-laborers: the names of the apostolic churches were
      applied to the congregations which they assembled in Armenia and
      Cappadocia; and this innocent allegory revived the example and
      memory of the first ages. In the Gospel, and the Epistles of St.
      Paul, his faithful follower investigated the Creed of primitive
      Christianity; and, whatever might be the success, a Protestant
      reader will applaud the spirit, of the inquiry. But if the
      Scriptures of the Paulicians were pure, they were not perfect.
      Their founders rejected the two Epistles of St. Peter, 4 the
      apostle of the circumcision, whose dispute with their favorite
      for the observance of the law could not easily be forgiven. 5
      They agreed with their Gnostic brethren in the universal contempt
      for the Old Testament, the books of Moses and the prophets, which
      have been consecrated by the decrees of the Catholic church. With
      equal boldness, and doubtless with more reason, Constantine, the
      new Sylvanus, disclaimed the visions, which, in so many bulky and
      splendid volumes, had been published by the Oriental sects; 6 the
      fabulous productions of the Hebrew patriarchs and the sages of
      the East; the spurious gospels, epistles, and acts, which in the
      first age had overwhelmed the orthodox code; the theology of
      Manes, and the authors of the kindred heresies; and the thirty
      generations, or aeons, which had been created by the fruitful
      fancy of Valentine. The Paulicians sincerely condemned the memory
      and opinions of the Manichaean sect, and complained of the
      injustice which impressed that invidious name on the simple
      votaries of St. Paul and of Christ.

      2 (return) [ In the time of Theodoret, the diocese of Cyrrhus, in
      Syria, contained eight hundred villages. Of these, two were
      inhabited by Arians and Eunomians, and eight by Marcionites, whom
      the laborious bishop reconciled to the Catholic church, (Dupin,
      Bibliot. Ecclesiastique, tom. iv. p. 81, 82.)]

      3 (return) [ Nobis profanis ista (sacra Evangelia) legere non
      licet sed sacerdotibus duntaxat, was the first scruple of a
      Catholic when he was advised to read the Bible, (Petr. Sicul. p.
      761.)]

      4 (return) [ In rejecting the second Epistle of St. Peter, the
      Paulicians are justified by some of the most respectable of the
      ancients and moderns, (see Wetstein ad loc., Simon, Hist.
      Critique du Nouveau Testament, c. 17.) They likewise overlooked
      the Apocalypse, (Petr. Sicul. p. 756;) but as such neglect is not
      imputed as a crime, the Greeks of the ixth century must have been
      careless of the credit and honor of the Revelations.]

      5 (return) [ This contention, which has not escaped the malice of
      Porphyry, supposes some error and passion in one or both of the
      apostles. By Chrysostom, Jerome, and Erasmus, it is represented
      as a sham quarrel a pious fraud, for the benefit of the Gentiles
      and the correction of the Jews, (Middleton’s Works, vol. ii. p.
      1-20.)]

      6 (return) [ Those who are curious of this heterodox library, may
      consult the researches of Beausobre, (Hist. Critique du
      Manicheisme, tom. i. p. 305-437.) Even in Africa, St. Austin
      could describe the Manichaean books, tam multi, tam grandes, tam
      pretiosi codices, (contra Faust. xiii. 14;) but he adds, without
      pity, Incendite omnes illas membranas: and his advice had been
      rigorously followed.]

      Of the ecclesiastical chain, many links had been broken by the
      Paulician reformers; and their liberty was enlarged, as they
      reduced the number of masters, at whose voice profane reason must
      bow to mystery and miracle. The early separation of the Gnostics
      had preceded the establishment of the Catholic worship; and
      against the gradual innovations of discipline and doctrine they
      were as strongly guarded by habit and aversion, as by the silence
      of St. Paul and the evangelists. The objects which had been
      transformed by the magic of superstition, appeared to the eyes of
      the Paulicians in their genuine and naked colors. An image made
      without hands was the common workmanship of a mortal artist, to
      whose skill alone the wood and canvas must be indebted for their
      merit or value. The miraculous relics were a heap of bones and
      ashes, destitute of life or virtue, or of any relation, perhaps,
      with the person to whom they were ascribed. The true and
      vivifying cross was a piece of sound or rotten timber, the body
      and blood of Christ, a loaf of bread and a cup of wine, the gifts
      of nature and the symbols of grace. The mother of God was
      degraded from her celestial honors and immaculate virginity; and
      the saints and angels were no longer solicited to exercise the
      laborious office of mediation in heaven, and ministry upon earth.
      In the practice, or at least in the theory, of the sacraments,
      the Paulicians were inclined to abolish all visible objects of
      worship, and the words of the gospel were, in their judgment, the
      baptism and communion of the faithful. They indulged a convenient
      latitude for the interpretation of Scripture: and as often as
      they were pressed by the literal sense, they could escape to the
      intricate mazes of figure and allegory. Their utmost diligence
      must have been employed to dissolve the connection between the
      Old and the New Testament; since they adored the latter as the
      oracles of God, and abhorred the former as the fabulous and
      absurd invention of men or daemons. We cannot be surprised, that
      they should have found in the Gospel the orthodox mystery of the
      Trinity: but, instead of confessing the human nature and
      substantial sufferings of Christ, they amused their fancy with a
      celestial body that passed through the virgin like water through
      a pipe; with a fantastic crucifixion, that eluded the vain and
      important malice of the Jews. A creed thus simple and spiritual
      was not adapted to the genius of the times; 7 and the rational
      Christian, who might have been contented with the light yoke and
      easy burden of Jesus and his apostles, was justly offended, that
      the Paulicians should dare to violate the unity of God, the first
      article of natural and revealed religion. Their belief and their
      trust was in the Father, of Christ, of the human soul, and of the
      invisible world.

      But they likewise held the eternity of matter; a stubborn and
      rebellious substance, the origin of a second principle of an
      active being, who has created this visible world, and exercises
      his temporal reign till the final consummation of death and sin.
      8 The appearances of moral and physical evil had established the
      two principles in the ancient philosophy and religion of the
      East; from whence this doctrine was transfused to the various
      swarms of the Gnostics. A thousand shades may be devised in the
      nature and character of Ahriman, from a rival god to a
      subordinate daemon, from passion and frailty to pure and perfect
      malevolence: but, in spite of our efforts, the goodness, and the
      power, of Ormusd are placed at the opposite extremities of the
      line; and every step that approaches the one must recede in equal
      proportion from the other. 9

      7 (return) [ The six capital errors of the Paulicians are defined
      by Peter (p. 756,) with much prejudice and passion.]

      8 (return) [ Primum illorum axioma est, duo rerum esse principia;
      Deum malum et Deum bonum, aliumque hujus mundi conditorem et
      princi pem, et alium futuri aevi, (Petr. Sicul. 765.)]

      9 (return) [ Two learned critics, Beausobre (Hist. Critique du
      Manicheisme, l. i. iv. v. vi.) and Mosheim, (Institut. Hist.
      Eccles. and de Rebus Christianis ante Constantinum, sec. i. ii.
      iii.,) have labored to explore and discriminate the various
      systems of the Gnostics on the subject of the two principles.]

      The apostolic labors of Constantine Sylvanus soon multiplied the
      number of his disciples, the secret recompense of spiritual
      ambition. The remnant of the Gnostic sects, and especially the
      Manichaeans of Armenia, were united under his standard; many
      Catholics were converted or seduced by his arguments; and he
      preached with success in the regions of Pontus 10 and Cappadocia,
      which had long since imbibed the religion of Zoroaster. The
      Paulician teachers were distinguished only by their Scriptural
      names, by the modest title of Fellow-pilgrims, by the austerity
      of their lives, their zeal or knowledge, and the credit of some
      extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit. But they were incapable
      of desiring, or at least of obtaining, the wealth and honors of
      the Catholic prelacy; such anti-Christian pride they bitterly
      censured; and even the rank of elders or presbyters was condemned
      as an institution of the Jewish synagogue. The new sect was
      loosely spread over the provinces of Asia Minor to the westward
      of the Euphrates; six of their principal congregations
      represented the churches to which St. Paul had addressed his
      epistles; and their founder chose his residence in the
      neighborhood of Colonia, 11 in the same district of Pontus which
      had been celebrated by the altars of Bellona 12 and the miracles
      of Gregory. 13 After a mission of twenty-seven years, Sylvanus,
      who had retired from the tolerating government of the Arabs, fell
      a sacrifice to Roman persecution. The laws of the pious emperors,
      which seldom touched the lives of less odious heretics,
      proscribed without mercy or disguise the tenets, the books, and
      the persons of the Montanists and Manichaeans: the books were
      delivered to the flames; and all who should presume to secrete
      such writings, or to profess such opinions, were devoted to an
      ignominious death. 14 A Greek minister, armed with legal and
      military powers, appeared at Colonia to strike the shepherd, and
      to reclaim, if possible, the lost sheep. By a refinement of
      cruelty, Simeon placed the unfortunate Sylvanus before a line of
      his disciples, who were commanded, as the price of their pardon
      and the proof of their repentance, to massacre their spiritual
      father. They turned aside from the impious office; the stones
      dropped from their filial hands, and of the whole number, only
      one executioner could be found, a new David, as he is styled by
      the Catholics, who boldly overthrew the giant of heresy. This
      apostate (Justin was his name) again deceived and betrayed his
      unsuspecting brethren, and a new conformity to the acts of St.
      Paul may be found in the conversion of Simeon: like the apostle,
      he embraced the doctrine which he had been sent to persecute,
      renounced his honors and fortunes, and required among the
      Paulicians the fame of a missionary and a martyr. They were not
      ambitious of martyrdom, 15 but in a calamitous period of one
      hundred and fifty years, their patience sustained whatever zeal
      could inflict; and power was insufficient to eradicate the
      obstinate vegetation of fanaticism and reason. From the blood and
      ashes of the first victims, a succession of teachers and
      congregations repeatedly arose: amidst their foreign hostilities,
      they found leisure for domestic quarrels: they preached, they
      disputed, they suffered; and the virtues, the apparent virtues,
      of Sergius, in a pilgrimage of thirty-three years, are
      reluctantly confessed by the orthodox historians. 16 The native
      cruelty of Justinian the Second was stimulated by a pious cause;
      and he vainly hoped to extinguish, in a single conflagration, the
      name and memory of the Paulicians. By their primitive simplicity,
      their abhorrence of popular superstition, the Iconoclast princes
      might have been reconciled to some erroneous doctrines; but they
      themselves were exposed to the calumnies of the monks, and they
      chose to be the tyrants, lest they should be accused as the
      accomplices, of the Manichaeans. Such a reproach has sullied the
      clemency of Nicephorus, who relaxed in their favor the severity
      of the penal statutes, nor will his character sustain the honor
      of a more liberal motive. The feeble Michael the First, the rigid
      Leo the Armenian, were foremost in the race of persecution; but
      the prize must doubtless be adjudged to the sanguinary devotion
      of Theodora, who restored the images to the Oriental church. Her
      inquisitors explored the cities and mountains of the Lesser Asia,
      and the flatterers of the empress have affirmed that, in a short
      reign, one hundred thousand Paulicians were extirpated by the
      sword, the gibbet, or the flames. Her guilt or merit has perhaps
      been stretched beyond the measure of truth: but if the account be
      allowed, it must be presumed that many simple Iconoclasts were
      punished under a more odious name; and that some who were driven
      from the church, unwillingly took refuge in the bosom of heresy.

      10 (return) [ The countries between the Euphrates and the Halys
      were possessed above 350 years by the Medes (Herodot. l. i. c.
      103) and Persians; and the kings of Pontus were of the royal race
      of the Achaemenides, (Sallust. Fragment. l. iii. with the French
      supplement and notes of the president de Brosses.)]

      11 (return) [ Most probably founded by Pompey after the conquest
      of Pontus. This Colonia, on the Lycus, above Neo-Caesarea, is
      named by the Turks Coulei-hisar, or Chonac, a populous town in a
      strong country, (D’Anville, Geographie Ancienne, tom. ii. p. 34.
      Tournefort, Voyage du Levant, tom. iii. lettre xxi. p. 293.)]

      12 (return) [ The temple of Bellona, at Comana in Pontus was a
      powerful and wealthy foundation, and the high priest was
      respected as the second person in the kingdom. As the sacerdotal
      office had been occupied by his mother’s family, Strabo (l. xii.
      p. 809, 835, 836, 837) dwells with peculiar complacency on the
      temple, the worship, and festival, which was twice celebrated
      every year. But the Bellona of Pontus had the features and
      character of the goddess, not of war, but of love.]

      13 (return) [ Gregory, bishop of Neo-Caesarea, (A.D. 240-265,)
      surnamed Thaumaturgus, or the Wonder-worker. An hundred years
      afterwards, the history or romance of his life was composed by
      Gregory of Nyssa, his namesake and countryman, the brother of the
      great St. Basil.]

      14 (return) [ Hoc caeterum ad sua egregia facinora, divini atque
      orthodoxi Imperatores addiderunt, ut Manichaeos Montanosque
      capitali puniri sententia juberent, eorumque libros, quocunque in
      loco inventi essent, flammis tradi; quod siquis uspiam eosdem
      occultasse deprehenderetur, hunc eundem mortis poenae addici,
      ejusque bona in fiscum inferri, (Petr. Sicul. p. 759.) What more
      could bigotry and persecution desire?]

      15 (return) [ It should seem, that the Paulicians allowed
      themselves some latitude of equivocation and mental reservation;
      till the Catholics discovered the pressing questions, which
      reduced them to the alternative of apostasy or martyrdom, (Petr.
      Sicul. p. 760.)]

      16 (return) [ The persecution is told by Petrus Siculus (p.
      579-763) with satisfaction and pleasantry. Justus justa
      persolvit. See likewise Cedrenus, (p. 432-435.)]

      The most furious and desperate of rebels are the sectaries of a
      religion long persecuted, and at length provoked. In a holy cause
      they are no longer susceptible of fear or remorse: the justice of
      their arms hardens them against the feelings of humanity; and
      they revenge their fathers’ wrongs on the children of their
      tyrants. Such have been the Hussites of Bohemia and the
      Calvinists of France, and such, in the ninth century, were the
      Paulicians of Armenia and the adjacent provinces. 17 They were
      first awakened to the massacre of a governor and bishop, who
      exercised the Imperial mandate of converting or destroying the
      heretics; and the deepest recesses of Mount Argaeus protected
      their independence and revenge. A more dangerous and consuming
      flame was kindled by the persecution of Theodora, and the revolt
      of Carbeas, a valiant Paulician, who commanded the guards of the
      general of the East. His father had been impaled by the Catholic
      inquisitors; and religion, or at least nature, might justify his
      desertion and revenge. Five thousand of his brethren were united
      by the same motives; they renounced the allegiance of
      anti-Christian Rome; a Saracen emir introduced Carbeas to the
      caliph; and the commander of the faithful extended his sceptre to
      the implacable enemy of the Greeks. In the mountains between
      Siwas and Trebizond he founded or fortified the city of Tephrice,
      18 which is still occupied by a fierce or licentious people, and
      the neighboring hills were covered with the Paulician fugitives,
      who now reconciled the use of the Bible and the sword. During
      more than thirty years, Asia was afflicted by the calamities of
      foreign and domestic war; in their hostile inroads, the disciples
      of St. Paul were joined with those of Mahomet; and the peaceful
      Christians, the aged parent and tender virgin, who were delivered
      into barbarous servitude, might justly accuse the intolerant
      spirit of their sovereign. So urgent was the mischief, so
      intolerable the shame, that even the dissolute Michael, the son
      of Theodora, was compelled to march in person against the
      Paulicians: he was defeated under the walls of Samosata; and the
      Roman emperor fled before the heretics whom his mother had
      condemned to the flames. The Saracens fought under the same
      banners, but the victory was ascribed to Carbeas; and the captive
      generals, with more than a hundred tribunes, were either released
      by his avarice, or tortured by his fanaticism. The valor and
      ambition of Chrysocheir, 19 his successor, embraced a wider
      circle of rapine and revenge. In alliance with his faithful
      Moslems, he boldly penetrated into the heart of Asia; the troops
      of the frontier and the palace were repeatedly overthrown; the
      edicts of persecution were answered by the pillage of Nice and
      Nicomedia, of Ancyra and Ephesus; nor could the apostle St. John
      protect from violation his city and sepulchre. The cathedral of
      Ephesus was turned into a stable for mules and horses; and the
      Paulicians vied with the Saracens in their contempt and
      abhorrence of images and relics. It is not unpleasing to observe
      the triumph of rebellion over the same despotism which had
      disdained the prayers of an injured people. The emperor Basil,
      the Macedonian, was reduced to sue for peace, to offer a ransom
      for the captives, and to request, in the language of moderation
      and charity, that Chrysocheir would spare his fellow-Christians,
      and content himself with a royal donative of gold and silver and
      silk garments. “If the emperor,” replied the insolent fanatic,
      “be desirous of peace, let him abdicate the East, and reign
      without molestation in the West. If he refuse, the servants of
      the Lord will precipitate him from the throne.” The reluctant
      Basil suspended the treaty, accepted the defiance, and led his
      army into the land of heresy, which he wasted with fire and
      sword. The open country of the Paulicians was exposed to the same
      calamities which they had inflicted; but when he had explored the
      strength of Tephrice, the multitude of the Barbarians, and the
      ample magazines of arms and provisions, he desisted with a sigh
      from the hopeless siege. On his return to Constantinople, he
      labored, by the foundation of convents and churches, to secure
      the aid of his celestial patrons, of Michael the archangel and
      the prophet Elijah; and it was his daily prayer that he might
      live to transpierce, with three arrows, the head of his impious
      adversary. Beyond his expectations, the wish was accomplished:
      after a successful inroad, Chrysocheir was surprised and slain in
      his retreat; and the rebel’s head was triumphantly presented at
      the foot of the throne. On the reception of this welcome trophy,
      Basil instantly called for his bow, discharged three arrows with
      unerring aim, and accepted the applause of the court, who hailed
      the victory of the royal archer. With Chrysocheir, the glory of
      the Paulicians faded and withered: 20 on the second expedition of
      the emperor, the impregnable Tephrice, was deserted by the
      heretics, who sued for mercy or escaped to the borders. The city
      was ruined, but the spirit of independence survived in the
      mountains: the Paulicians defended, above a century, their
      religion and liberty, infested the Roman limits, and maintained
      their perpetual alliance with the enemies of the empire and the
      gospel.

      Chapter LIV: Origin And Doctrine Of The Paulicians.—Part II.

      About the middle of the eight century, Constantine, surnamed
      Copronymus by the worshippers of images, had made an expedition
      into Armenia, and found, in the cities of Melitene and
      Theodosiopolis, a great number of Paulicians, his kindred
      heretics. As a favor, or punishment, he transplanted them from
      the banks of the Euphrates to Constantinople and Thrace; and by
      this emigration their doctrine was introduced and diffused in
      Europe. 21 If the sectaries of the metropolis were soon mingled
      with the promiscuous mass, those of the country struck a deep
      root in a foreign soil. The Paulicians of Thrace resisted the
      storms of persecution, maintained a secret correspondence with
      their Armenian brethren, and gave aid and comfort to their
      preachers, who solicited, not without success, the infant faith
      of the Bulgarians. 22 In the tenth century, they were restored
      and multiplied by a more powerful colony, which John Zimisces 23
      transported from the Chalybian hills to the valleys of Mount
      Haemus. The Oriental clergy who would have preferred the
      destruction, impatiently sighed for the absence, of the
      Manichaeans: the warlike emperor had felt and esteemed their
      valor: their attachment to the Saracens was pregnant with
      mischief; but, on the side of the Danube, against the Barbarians
      of Scythia, their service might be useful, and their loss would
      be desirable. Their exile in a distant land was softened by a
      free toleration: the Paulicians held the city of Philippopolis
      and the keys of Thrace; the Catholics were their subjects; the
      Jacobite emigrants their associates: they occupied a line of
      villages and castles in Macedonia and Epirus; and many native
      Bulgarians were associated to the communion of arms and heresy.
      As long as they were awed by power and treated with moderation,
      their voluntary bands were distinguished in the armies of the
      empire; and the courage of these dogs, ever greedy of war, ever
      thirsty of human blood, is noticed with astonishment, and almost
      with reproach, by the pusillanimous Greeks. The same spirit
      rendered them arrogant and contumacious: they were easily
      provoked by caprice or injury; and their privileges were often
      violated by the faithless bigotry of the government and clergy.
      In the midst of the Norman war, two thousand five hundred
      Manichaeans deserted the standard of Alexius Comnenus, 24 and
      retired to their native homes. He dissembled till the moment of
      revenge; invited the chiefs to a friendly conference; and
      punished the innocent and guilty by imprisonment, confiscation,
      and baptism. In an interval of peace, the emperor undertook the
      pious office of reconciling them to the church and state: his
      winter quarters were fixed at Philippopolis; and the thirteenth
      apostle, as he is styled by his pious daughter, consumed whole
      days and nights in theological controversy. His arguments were
      fortified, their obstinacy was melted, by the honors and rewards
      which he bestowed on the most eminent proselytes; and a new city,
      surrounded with gardens, enriched with immunities, and dignified
      with his own name, was founded by Alexius for the residence of
      his vulgar converts. The important station of Philippopolis was
      wrested from their hands; the contumacious leaders were secured
      in a dungeon, or banished from their country; and their lives
      were spared by the prudence, rather than the mercy, of an
      emperor, at whose command a poor and solitary heretic was burnt
      alive before the church of St. Sophia. 25 But the proud hope of
      eradicating the prejudices of a nation was speedily overturned by
      the invincible zeal of the Paulicians, who ceased to dissemble or
      refused to obey. After the departure and death of Alexius, they
      soon resumed their civil and religious laws. In the beginning of
      the thirteenth century, their pope or primate (a manifest
      corruption) resided on the confines of Bulgaria, Croatia, and
      Dalmatia, and governed, by his vicars, the filial congregations
      of Italy and France. 26 From that aera, a minute scrutiny might
      prolong and perpetuate the chain of tradition. At the end of the
      last age, the sect or colony still inhabited the valleys of Mount
      Haemus, where their ignorance and poverty were more frequently
      tormented by the Greek clergy than by the Turkish government. The
      modern Paulicians have lost all memory of their origin; and their
      religion is disgraced by the worship of the cross, and the
      practice of bloody sacrifice, which some captives have imported
      from the wilds of Tartary. 27

      In the West, the first teachers of the Manichaean theology had
      been repulsed by the people, or suppressed by the prince. The
      favor and success of the Paulicians in the eleventh and twelfth
      centuries must be imputed to the strong, though secret,
      discontent which armed the most pious Christians against the
      church of Rome. Her avarice was oppressive, her despotism odious;
      less degenerate perhaps than the Greeks in the worship of saints
      and images, her innovations were more rapid and scandalous: she
      had rigorously defined and imposed the doctrine of
      transubstantiation: the lives of the Latin clergy were more
      corrupt, and the Eastern bishops might pass for the successors of
      the apostles, if they were compared with the lordly prelates, who
      wielded by turns the crosier, the sceptre, and the sword. Three
      different roads might introduce the Paulicians into the heart of
      Europe. After the conversion of Hungary, the pilgrims who visited
      Jerusalem might safely follow the course of the Danube: in their
      journey and return they passed through Philippopolis; and the
      sectaries, disguising their name and heresy, might accompany the
      French or German caravans to their respective countries. The
      trade and dominion of Venice pervaded the coast of the Adriatic,
      and the hospitable republic opened her bosom to foreigners of
      every climate and religion. Under the Byzantine standard, the
      Paulicians were often transported to the Greek provinces of Italy
      and Sicily: in peace and war, they freely conversed with
      strangers and natives, and their opinions were silently
      propagated in Rome, Milan, and the kingdoms beyond the Alps. 28
      It was soon discovered, that many thousand Catholics of every
      rank, and of either sex, had embraced the Manichaean heresy; and
      the flames which consumed twelve canons of Orleans was the first
      act and signal of persecution. The Bulgarians, 29 a name so
      innocent in its origin, so odious in its application, spread
      their branches over the face of Europe. United in common hatred
      of idolatry and Rome, they were connected by a form of episcopal
      and presbyterian government; their various sects were
      discriminated by some fainter or darker shades of theology; but
      they generally agreed in the two principles, the contempt of the
      Old Testament and the denial of the body of Christ, either on the
      cross or in the eucharist. A confession of simple worship and
      blameless manners is extorted from their enemies; and so high was
      their standard of perfection, that the increasing congregations
      were divided into two classes of disciples, of those who
      practised, and of those who aspired. It was in the country of the
      Albigeois, 30 in the southern provinces of France, that the
      Paulicians were most deeply implanted; and the same vicissitudes
      of martyrdom and revenge which had been displayed in the
      neighborhood of the Euphrates, were repeated in the thirteenth
      century on the banks of the Rhone. The laws of the Eastern
      emperors were revived by Frederic the Second. The insurgents of
      Tephrice were represented by the barons and cities of Languedoc:
      Pope Innocent III. surpassed the sanguinary fame of Theodora. It
      was in cruelty alone that her soldiers could equal the heroes of
      the Crusades, and the cruelty of her priests was far excelled by
      the founders of the Inquisition; 31 an office more adapted to
      confirm, than to refute, the belief of an evil principle. The
      visible assemblies of the Paulicians, or Albigeois, were
      extirpated by fire and sword; and the bleeding remnant escaped by
      flight, concealment, or Catholic conformity. But the invincible
      spirit which they had kindled still lived and breathed in the
      Western world. In the state, in the church, and even in the
      cloister, a latent succession was preserved of the disciples of
      St. Paul; who protested against the tyranny of Rome, embraced the
      Bible as the rule of faith, and purified their creed from all the
      visions of the Gnostic theology. 3111 The struggles of Wickliff
      in England, of Huss in Bohemia, were premature and ineffectual;
      but the names of Zuinglius, Luther, and Calvin, are pronounced
      with gratitude as the deliverers of nations.

      A philosopher, who calculates the degree of their merit and the
      value of their reformation, will prudently ask from what articles
      of faith, above or against our reason, they have enfranchised the
      Christians; for such enfranchisement is doubtless a benefit so
      far as it may be compatible with truth and piety. After a fair
      discussion, we shall rather be surprised by the timidity, than
      scandalized by the freedom, of our first reformers. 32 With the
      Jews, they adopted the belief and defence of all the Hebrew
      Scriptures, with all their prodigies, from the garden of Eden to
      the visions of the prophet Daniel; and they were bound, like the
      Catholics, to justify against the Jews the abolition of a divine
      law. In the great mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation the
      reformers were severely orthodox: they freely adopted the
      theology of the four, or the six first councils; and with the
      Athanasian creed, they pronounced the eternal damnation of all
      who did not believe the Catholic faith. Transubstantiation, the
      invisible change of the bread and wine into the body and blood of
      Christ, is a tenet that may defy the power of argument and
      pleasantry; but instead of consulting the evidence of their
      senses, of their sight, their feeling, and their taste, the first
      Protestants were entangled in their own scruples, and awed by the
      words of Jesus in the institution of the sacrament. Luther
      maintained a corporeal, and Calvin a real, presence of Christ in
      the eucharist; and the opinion of Zuinglius, that it is no more
      than a spiritual communion, a simple memorial, has slowly
      prevailed in the reformed churches. 33 But the loss of one
      mystery was amply compensated by the stupendous doctrines of
      original sin, redemption, faith, grace, and predestination, which
      have been strained from the epistles of St. Paul. These subtile
      questions had most assuredly been prepared by the fathers and
      schoolmen; but the final improvement and popular use may be
      attributed to the first reformers, who enforced them as the
      absolute and essential terms of salvation. Hitherto the weight of
      supernatural belief inclines against the Protestants; and many a
      sober Christian would rather admit that a wafer is God, than that
      God is a cruel and capricious tyrant.

      32 (return) [ The opinions and proceedings of the reformers are
      exposed in the second part of the general history of Mosheim; but
      the balance, which he has held with so clear an eye, and so
      steady a hand, begins to incline in favor of his Lutheran
      brethren.]

      33 (return) [ Under Edward VI. our reformation was more bold and
      perfect, but in the fundamental articles of the church of
      England, a strong and explicit declaration against the real
      presence was obliterated in the original copy, to please the
      people or the Lutherans, or Queen Elizabeth, (Burnet’s History of
      the Reformation, vol. ii. p. 82, 128, 302.)]

      Yet the services of Luther and his rivals are solid and
      important; and the philosopher must own his obligations to these
      fearless enthusiasts. 34 I. By their hands the lofty fabric of
      superstition, from the abuse of indulgences to the intercesson of
      the Virgin, has been levelled with the ground. Myriads of both
      sexes of the monastic profession were restored to the liberty and
      labors of social life. A hierarchy of saints and angels, of
      imperfect and subordinate deities, were stripped of their
      temporal power, and reduced to the enjoyment of celestial
      happiness; their images and relics were banished from the church;
      and the credulity of the people was no longer nourished with the
      daily repetition of miracles and visions. The imitation of
      Paganism was supplied by a pure and spiritual worship of prayer
      and thanksgiving, the most worthy of man, the least unworthy of
      the Deity. It only remains to observe, whether such sublime
      simplicity be consistent with popular devotion; whether the
      vulgar, in the absence of all visible objects, will not be
      inflamed by enthusiasm, or insensibly subside in languor and
      indifference. II. The chain of authority was broken, which
      restrains the bigot from thinking as he pleases, and the slave
      from speaking as he thinks: the popes, fathers, and councils,
      were no longer the supreme and infallible judges of the world;
      and each Christian was taught to acknowledge no law but the
      Scriptures, no interpreter but his own conscience. This freedom,
      however, was the consequence, rather than the design, of the
      Reformation. The patriot reformers were ambitious of succeeding
      the tyrants whom they had dethroned. They imposed with equal
      rigor their creeds and confessions; they asserted the right of
      the magistrate to punish heretics with death. The pious or
      personal animosity of Calvin proscribed in Servetus 35 the guilt
      of his own rebellion; 36 and the flames of Smithfield, in which
      he was afterwards consumed, had been kindled for the Anabaptists
      by the zeal of Cranmer. 37 The nature of the tiger wa s the same,
      but he was gradually deprived of his teeth and fangs. A spiritual
      and temporal kingdom was possessed by the Roman pontiff; the
      Protestant doctors were subjects of an humble rank, without
      revenue or jurisdiction. His decrees were consecrated by the
      antiquity of the Catholic church: their arguments and disputes
      were submitted to the people; and their appeal to private
      judgment was accepted beyond their wishes, by curiosity and
      enthusiasm. Since the days of Luther and Calvin, a secret
      reformation has been silently working in the bosom of the
      reformed churches; many weeds of prejudice were eradicated; and
      the disciples of Erasmus 38 diffused a spirit of freedom and
      moderation. The liberty of conscience has been claimed as a
      common benefit, an inalienable right: 39 the free governments of
      Holland 40 and England 41 introduced the practice of toleration;
      and the narrow allowance of the laws has been enlarged by the
      prudence and humanity of the times. In the exercise, the mind has
      understood the limits of its powers, and the words and shadows
      that might amuse the child can no longer satisfy his manly
      reason. The volumes of controversy are overspread with cobwebs:
      the doctrine of a Protestant church is far removed from the
      knowledge or belief of its private members; and the forms of
      orthodoxy, the articles of faith, are subscribed with a sigh, or
      a smile, by the modern clergy. Yet the friends of Christianity
      are alarmed at the boundless impulse of inquiry and scepticism.
      The predictions of the Catholics are accomplished: the web of
      mystery is unravelled by the Arminians, Arians, and Socinians,
      whose number must not be computed from their separate
      congregations; and the pillars of Revelation are shaken by those
      men who preserve the name without the substance of religion, who
      indulge the license without the temper of philosophy. 42 4211

      envy. He accused his adversary before their common enemies, the
      judges of Vienna, and betrayed, for his destruction, the sacred
      trust of a private correspondence. 2. The deed of cruelty was not
      varnished by the pretence of danger to the church or state. In
      his passage through Geneva, Servetus was a harmless stranger, who
      neither preached, nor printed, nor made proselytes. 3. A Catholic
      inquisition yields the same obedience which he requires, but
      Calvin violated the golden rule of doing as he would be done by;
      a rule which I read in a moral treatise of Isocrates (in Nicocle,

      Grotius, (de Rebus Belgicis, Annal. l. i. p. 13, 14, edit. in
      12mo.,) who approves the Imperial laws of persecution, and only
      condemns the bloody tribunal of the inquisition.]

      41 (return) [ Sir William Blackstone (Commentaries, vol. iv. p.
      53, 54) explains the law of England as it was fixed at the
      Revolution. The exceptions of Papists, and of those who deny the
      Trinity, would still have a tolerable scope for persecution if
      the national spirit were not more effectual than a hundred
      statutes.]

      42 (return) [ I shall recommend to public animadversion two
      passages in Dr. Priestley, which betray the ultimate tendency of
      his opinions. At the first of these (Hist. of the Corruptions of
      Christianity, vol. i. p. 275, 276) the priest, at the second
      (vol. ii. p. 484) the magistrate, may tremble!]

      4211 (return) [ There is something ludicrous, if it were not
      offensive, in Gibbon holding up to “public animadversion” the
      opinions of any believer in Christianity, however imperfect his
      creed. The observations which the whole of this passage on the
      effects of the reformation, in which much truth and justice is
      mingled with much prejudice, would suggest, could not possibly be
      compressed into a note; and would indeed embrace the whole
      religious and irreligious history of the time which has elapsed
      since Gibbon wrote.—M.]
