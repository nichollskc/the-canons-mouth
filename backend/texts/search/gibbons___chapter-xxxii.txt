Chapter XXXII: Emperors Arcadius, Eutropius, Theodosius II.—Part
      I.

     Arcadius Emperor Of The East.—Administration And Disgrace Of
     Eutropius.—Revolt Of Gainas.—Persecution Of St. John
     Chrysostom.—Theodosius II. Emperor Of The East.—His Sister
     Pulcheria.—His Wife Eudocia.—The Persian War, And Division Of
     Armenia.

      The division of the Roman world between the sons of Theodosius
      marks the final establishment of the empire of the East, which,
      from the reign of Arcadius to the taking of Constantinople by the
      Turks, subsisted one thousand and fifty-eight years, in a state
      of premature and perpetual decay. The sovereign of that empire
      assumed, and obstinately retained, the vain, and at length
      fictitious, title of Emperor of the Romans; and the hereditary
      appellation of Caesar and Augustus continued to declare, that he
      was the legitimate successor of the first of men, who had reigned
      over the first of nations. The place of Constantinople rivalled,
      and perhaps excelled, the magnificence of Persia; and the
      eloquent sermons of St. Chrysostom 1 celebrate, while they
      condemn, the pompous luxury of the reign of Arcadius. “The
      emperor,” says he, “wears on his head either a diadem, or a crown
      of gold, decorated with precious stones of inestimable value.
      These ornaments, and his purple garments, are reserved for his
      sacred person alone; and his robes of silk are embroidered with
      the figures of golden dragons. His throne is of massy gold.
      Whenever he appears in public, he is surrounded by his courtiers,
      his guards, and his attendants. Their spears, their shields,
      their cuirasses, the bridles and trappings of their horses, have
      either the substance or the appearance of gold; and the large
      splendid boss in the midst of their shield is encircled with
      smaller bosses, which represent the shape of the human eye. The
      two mules that drew the chariot of the monarch are perfectly
      white, and shining all over with gold. The chariot itself, of
      pure and solid gold, attracts the admiration of the spectators,
      who contemplate the purple curtains, the snowy carpet, the size
      of the precious stones, and the resplendent plates of gold, that
      glitter as they are agitated by the motion of the carriage. The
      Imperial pictures are white, on a blue ground; the emperor
      appears seated on his throne, with his arms, his horses, and his
      guards beside him; and his vanquished enemies in chains at his
      feet.” The successors of Constantine established their perpetual
      residence in the royal city, which he had erected on the verge of
      Europe and Asia. Inaccessible to the menaces of their enemies,
      and perhaps to the complaints of their people, they received,
      with each wind, the tributary productions of every climate; while
      the impregnable strength of their capital continued for ages to
      defy the hostile attempts of the Barbarians. Their dominions were
      bounded by the Adriatic and the Tigris; and the whole interval of
      twenty-five days’ navigation, which separated the extreme cold of
      Scythia from the torrid zone of Æthiopia, 2 was comprehended
      within the limits of the empire of the East. The populous
      countries of that empire were the seat of art and learning, of
      luxury and wealth; and the inhabitants, who had assumed the
      language and manners of Greeks, styled themselves, with some
      appearance of truth, the most enlightened and civilized portion
      of the human species. The form of government was a pure and
      simple monarchy; the name of the Roman Republic, which so long
      preserved a faint tradition of freedom, was confined to the Latin
      provinces; and the princes of Constantinople measured their
      greatness by the servile obedience of their people. They were
      ignorant how much this passive disposition enervates and degrades
      every faculty of the mind. The subjects, who had resigned their
      will to the absolute commands of a master, were equally incapable
      of guarding their lives and fortunes against the assaults of the
      Barbarians, or of defending their reason from the terrors of
      superstition.

      1 (return) [ Father Montfaucon, who, by the command of his
      Benedictine superiors, was compelled (see Longueruana, tom. i. p.
      205) to execute the laborious edition of St. Chrysostom, in
      thirteen volumes in folio, (Paris, 1738,) amused himself with
      extracting from that immense collection of morals, some curious
      antiquities, which illustrate the manners of the Theodosian age,
      (see Chrysostom, Opera, tom. xiii. p. 192-196,) and his French
      Dissertation, in the Mémoires de l’Acad. des Inscriptions, tom.
      xiii. p. 474-490.]

      2 (return) [ According to the loose reckoning, that a ship could
      sail, with a fair wind, 1000 stadia, or 125 miles, in the
      revolution of a day and night, Diodorus Siculus computes ten days
      from the Palus Moeotis to Rhodes, and four days from Rhodes to
      Alexandria. The navigation of the Nile from Alexandria to Syene,
      under the tropic of Cancer, required, as it was against the
      stream, ten days more. Diodor. Sicul. tom. i. l. iii. p. 200,

      extreme heat from the verge of the torrid zone; but he speaks of
      the Moeotis in the 47th degree of northern latitude, as if it lay
      within the polar circle.]

      The first events of the reign of Arcadius and Honorius are so
      intimately connected, that the rebellion of the Goths, and the
      fall of Rufinus, have already claimed a place in the history of
      the West. It has already been observed, that Eutropius, 3 one of
      the principal eunuchs of the palace of Constantinople, succeeded
      the haughty minister whose ruin he had accomplished, and whose
      vices he soon imitated. Every order of the state bowed to the new
      favorite; and their tame and obsequious submission encouraged him
      to insult the laws, and, what is still more difficult and
      dangerous, the manners of his country. Under the weakest of the
      predecessors of Arcadius, the reign of the eunuchs had been
      secret and almost invisible. They insinuated themselves into the
      confidence of the prince; but their ostensible functions were
      confined to the menial service of the wardrobe and Imperial
      bed-chamber. They might direct, in a whisper, the public
      counsels, and blast, by their malicious suggestions, the fame and
      fortunes of the most illustrious citizens; but they never
      presumed to stand forward in the front of empire, 4 or to profane
      the public honors of the state. Eutropius was the first of his
      artificial sex, who dared to assume the character of a Roman
      magistrate and general. Sometimes, in the presence of the
      blushing senate, he ascended the tribunal to pronounce judgment,
      or to repeat elaborate harangues; and, sometimes, appeared on
      horseback, at the head of his troops, in the dress and armor of a
      hero. The disregard of custom and decency always betrays a weak
      and ill-regulated mind; nor does Eutropius seem to have
      compensated for the folly of the design by any superior merit or
      ability in the execution. His former habits of life had not
      introduced him to the study of the laws, or the exercises of the
      field; his awkward and unsuccessful attempts provoked the secret
      contempt of the spectators; the Goths expressed their wish that
      such a general might always command the armies of Rome; and the
      name of the minister was branded with ridicule, more pernicious,
      perhaps, than hatred, to a public character. The subjects of
      Arcadius were exasperated by the recollection, that this deformed
      and decrepit eunuch, 6 who so perversely mimicked the actions of
      a man, was born in the most abject condition of servitude; that
      before he entered the Imperial palace, he had been successively
      sold and purchased by a hundred masters, who had exhausted his
      youthful strength in every mean and infamous office, and at
      length dismissed him, in his old age, to freedom and poverty. 7
      While these disgraceful stories were circulated, and perhaps
      exaggerated, in private conversation, the vanity of the favorite
      was flattered with the most extraordinary honors. In the senate,
      in the capital, in the provinces, the statues of Eutropius were
      erected, in brass, or marble, decorated with the symbols of his
      civil and military virtues, and inscribed with the pompous title
      of the third founder of Constantinople. He was promoted to the
      rank of patrician, which began to signify in a popular, and even
      legal, acceptation, the father of the emperor; and the last year
      of the fourth century was polluted by the consulship of a eunuch
      and a slave. This strange and inexpiable prodigy 8 awakened,
      however, the prejudices of the Romans. The effeminate consul was
      rejected by the West, as an indelible stain to the annals of the
      republic; and without invoking the shades of Brutus and Camillus,
      the colleague of Eutropius, a learned and respectable magistrate,
      9 sufficiently represented the different maxims of the two
      administrations.

      3 (return) [ Barthius, who adored his author with the blind
      superstition of a commentator, gives the preference to the two
      books which Claudian composed against Eutropius, above all his
      other productions, (Baillet Jugemens des Savans, tom. iv. p.
      227.) They are indeed a very elegant and spirited satire; and
      would be more valuable in an historical light, if the invective
      were less vague and more temperate.]

      4 (return) [ After lamenting the progress of the eunuchs in the
      Roman palace, and defining their proper functions, Claudian adds,

     A fronte recedant. Imperii. —-In Eutrop. i. 422.

      Yet it does not appear that the eunuchs had assumed any of the
      efficient offices of the empire, and he is styled only
      Praepositun sacri cubiculi, in the edict of his banishment. See
      Cod. Theod. l. leg 17.

     Jamque oblita sui, nec sobria divitiis mens In miseras leges
     hominumque negotia ludit Judicat eunuchus....... Arma etiam
     violare parat......

      Claudian, (i. 229-270,) with that mixture of indignation and
      humor which always pleases in a satiric poet, describes the
      insolent folly of the eunuch, the disgrace of the empire, and the
      joy of the Goths.

     Gaudet, cum viderit, hostis, Et sentit jam deesse viros.]

      6 (return) [ The poet’s lively description of his deformity (i.
      110-125) is confirmed by the authentic testimony of Chrysostom,
      (tom. iii. p. 384, edit Montfaucon;) who observes, that when the
      paint was washed away the face of Eutropius appeared more ugly
      and wrinkled than that of an old woman. Claudian remarks, (i.
      469,) and the remark must have been founded on experience, that
      there was scarcely an interval between the youth and the decrepit
      age of a eunuch.]

      7 (return) [ Eutropius appears to have been a native of Armenia
      or Assyria. His three services, which Claudian more particularly
      describes, were these: 1. He spent many years as the catamite of
      Ptolemy, a groom or soldier of the Imperial stables. 2. Ptolemy
      gave him to the old general Arintheus, for whom he very skilfully
      exercised the profession of a pimp. 3. He was given, on her
      marriage, to the daughter of Arintheus; and the future consul was
      employed to comb her hair, to present the silver ewer to wash and
      to fan his mistress in hot weather. See l. i. 31-137.]

      8 (return) [ Claudian, (l. i. in Eutrop. l.—22,) after
      enumerating the various prodigies of monstrous births, speaking
      animals, showers of blood or stones, double suns, &c., adds, with
      some exaggeration,

      Omnia cesserunt eunucho consule monstra.

      The first book concludes with a noble speech of the goddess of
      Rome to her favorite Honorius, deprecating the new ignominy to
      which she was exposed.]

      9 (return) [ Fl. Mallius Theodorus, whose civil honors, and
      philosophical works, have been celebrated by Claudian in a very
      elegant panegyric.]

      The bold and vigorous mind of Rufinus seems to have been actuated
      by a more sanguinary and revengeful spirit; but the avarice of
      the eunuch was not less insatiate than that of the præfect. 10
      As long as he despoiled the oppressors, who had enriched
      themselves with the plunder of the people, Eutropius might
      gratify his covetous disposition without much envy or injustice:
      but the progress of his rapine soon invaded the wealth which had
      been acquired by lawful inheritance, or laudable industry. The
      usual methods of extortion were practised and improved; and
      Claudian has sketched a lively and original picture of the public
      auction of the state. “The impotence of the eunuch,” says that
      agreeable satirist, “has served only to stimulate his avarice:
      the same hand which in his servile condition, was exercised in
      petty thefts, to unlock the coffers of his master, now grasps the
      riches of the world; and this infamous broker of the empire
      appreciates and divides the Roman provinces from Mount Haemus to
      the Tigris. One man, at the expense of his villa, is made
      proconsul of Asia; a second purchases Syria with his wife’s
      jewels; and a third laments that he has exchanged his paternal
      estate for the government of Bithynia. In the antechamber of
      Eutropius, a large tablet is exposed to public view, which marks
      the respective prices of the provinces. The different value of
      Pontus, of Galatia, of Lydia, is accurately distinguished. Lycia
      may be obtained for so many thousand pieces of gold; but the
      opulence of Phrygia will require a more considerable sum. The
      eunuch wishes to obliterate, by the general disgrace, his
      personal ignominy; and as he has been sold himself, he is
      desirous of selling the rest of mankind. In the eager contention,
      the balance, which contains the fate and fortunes of the
      province, often trembles on the beam; and till one of the scales
      is inclined, by a superior weight, the mind of the impartial
      judge remains in anxious suspense. Such,” continues the indignant
      poet, “are the fruits of Roman valor, of the defeat of Antiochus,
      and of the triumph of Pompey.” This venal prostitution of public
      honors secured the impunity of future crimes; but the riches,
      which Eutropius derived from confiscation, were already stained
      with injustice; since it was decent to accuse, and to condemn,
      the proprietors of the wealth, which he was impatient to
      confiscate. Some noble blood was shed by the hand of the
      executioner; and the most inhospitable extremities of the empire
      were filled with innocent and illustrious exiles. Among the
      generals and consuls of the East, Abundantius 12 had reason to
      dread the first effects of the resentment of Eutropius. He had
      been guilty of the unpardonable crime of introducing that abject
      slave to the palace of Constantinople; and some degree of praise
      must be allowed to a powerful and ungrateful favorite, who was
      satisfied with the disgrace of his benefactor. Abundantius was
      stripped of his ample fortunes by an Imperial rescript, and
      banished to Pityus, on the Euxine, the last frontier of the Roman
      world; where he subsisted by the precarious mercy of the
      Barbarians, till he could obtain, after the fall of Eutropius, a
      milder exile at Sidon, in Phoenicia. The destruction of Timasius
      13 required a more serious and regular mode of attack. That great
      officer, the master-general of the armies of Theodosius, had
      signalized his valor by a decisive victory, which he obtained
      over the Goths of Thessaly; but he was too prone, after the
      example of his sovereign, to enjoy the luxury of peace, and to
      abandon his confidence to wicked and designing flatterers.
      Timasius had despised the public clamor, by promoting an infamous
      dependant to the command of a cohort; and he deserved to feel the
      ingratitude of Bargus, who was secretly instigated by the
      favorite to accuse his patron of a treasonable conspiracy. The
      general was arraigned before the tribunal of Arcadius himself;
      and the principal eunuch stood by the side of the throne to
      suggest the questions and answers of his sovereign. But as this
      form of trial might be deemed partial and arbitrary, the further
      inquiry into the crimes of Timasius was delegated to Saturninus
      and Procopius; the former of consular rank, the latter still
      respected as the father-in-law of the emperor Valens. The
      appearances of a fair and legal proceeding were maintained by the
      blunt honesty of Procopius; and he yielded with reluctance to the
      obsequious dexterity of his colleague, who pronounced a sentence
      of condemnation against the unfortunate Timasius. His immense
      riches were confiscated in the name of the emperor, and for the
      benefit of the favorite; and he was doomed to perpetual exile a
      Oasis, a solitary spot in the midst of the sandy deserts of
      Libya. 14 Secluded from all human converse, the master-general of
      the Roman armies was lost forever to the world; but the
      circumstances of his fate have been related in a various and
      contradictory manner. It is insinuated that Eutropius despatched
      a private order for his secret execution. 15 It was reported,
      that, in attempting to escape from Oasis, he perished in the
      desert, of thirst and hunger; and that his dead body was found on
      the sands of Libya. 16 It has been asserted, with more
      confidence, that his son Syagrius, after successfully eluding the
      pursuit of the agents and emissaries of the court, collected a
      band of African robbers; that he rescued Timasius from the place
      of his exile; and that both the father and the son disappeared
      from the knowledge of mankind. 17 But the ungrateful Bargus,
      instead of being suffered to possess the reward of guilt was soon
      after circumvented and destroyed, by the more powerful villany of
      the minister himself, who retained sense and spirit enough to
      abhor the instrument of his own crimes.

      10 (return) [ Drunk with riches, is the forcible expression of
      Zosimus, (l. v. p. 301;) and the avarice of Eutropius is equally
      execrated in the Lexicon of Suidas and the Chronicle of
      Marcellinus Chrysostom had often admonished the favorite of the
      vanity and danger of immoderate wealth, tom. iii. p. 381.
      -certantum saepe duorum Diversum suspendit onus: cum pondere
      judex Vergit, et in geminas nutat provincia lances. Claudian (i.
      192-209) so curiously distinguishes the circumstances of the
      sale, that they all seem to allude to particular anecdotes.]

      12 (return) [ Claudian (i. 154-170) mentions the guilt and exile
      of Abundantius; nor could he fail to quote the example of the
      artist, who made the first trial of the brazen bull, which he
      presented to Phalaris. See Zosimus, l. v. p. 302. Jerom, tom. i.
      p. 26. The difference of place is easily reconciled; but the
      decisive authority of Asterius of Amasia (Orat. iv. p. 76, apud
      Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. v. p. 435) must turn the
      scale in favor of Pityus.]

      13 (return) [ Suidas (most probably from the history of Eunapius)
      has given a very unfavorable picture of Timasius. The account of
      his accuser, the judges, trial, &c., is perfectly agreeable to
      the practice of ancient and modern courts. (See Zosimus, l. v. p.
      298, 299, 300.) I am almost tempted to quote the romance of a
      great master, (Fielding’s Works, vol. iv. p. 49, &c., 8vo.
      edit.,) which may be considered as the history of human nature.]

      14 (return) [ The great Oasis was one of the spots in the sands
      of Libya, watered with springs, and capable of producing wheat,
      barley, and palm-trees. It was about three days’ journey from
      north to south, about half a day in breadth, and at the distance
      of about five days’ march to the west of Abydus, on the Nile. See
      D’Anville, Description de l’Egypte, p. 186, 187, 188. The barren
      desert which encompasses Oasis (Zosimus, l. v. p. 300) has
      suggested the idea of comparative fertility, and even the epithet
      of the happy island ]

      15 (return) [ The line of Claudian, in Eutrop. l. i. 180,

     Marmaricus claris violatur caedibus Hammon,

      evidently alludes to his persuasion of the death of Timasius. *
      Note: A fragment of Eunapius confirms this account. “Thus having
      deprived this great person of his life—a eunuch, a man, a slave,
      a consul, a minister of the bed-chamber, one bred in camps.” Mai,
      p. 283, in Niebuhr. 87—M.]

      16 (return) [ Sozomen, l. viii. c. 7. He speaks from report.]

      17 (return) [ Zosimus, l. v. p. 300. Yet he seems to suspect that
      this rumor was spread by the friends of Eutropius.]

      The public hatred, and the despair of individuals, continually
      threatened, or seemed to threaten, the personal safety of
      Eutropius; as well as of the numerous adherents, who were
      attached to his fortune, and had been promoted by his venal
      favor. For their mutual defence, he contrived the safeguard of a
      law, which violated every principal of humanity and justice. 18
      I. It is enacted, in the name, and by the authority of Arcadius,
      that all those who should conspire, either with subjects or with
      strangers, against the lives of any of the persons whom the
      emperor considers as the members of his own body, shall be
      punished with death and confiscation. This species of fictitious
      and metaphorical treason is extended to protect, not only the
      illustrious officers of the state and army, who were admitted
      into the sacred consistory, but likewise the principal domestics
      of the palace, the senators of Constantinople, the military
      commanders, and the civil magistrates of the provinces; a vague
      and indefinite list, which, under the successors of Constantine,
      included an obscure and numerous train of subordinate ministers.
      II. This extreme severity might perhaps be justified, had it been
      only directed to secure the representatives of the sovereign from
      any actual violence in the execution of their office. But the
      whole body of Imperial dependants claimed a privilege, or rather
      impunity, which screened them, in the loosest moments of their
      lives, from the hasty, perhaps the justifiable, resentment of
      their fellow-citizens; and, by a strange perversion of the laws,
      the same degree of guilt and punishment was applied to a private
      quarrel, and to a deliberate conspiracy against the emperor and
      the empire. The edicts of Arcadius most positively and most
      absurdly declares, that in such cases of treason, thoughts and
      actions ought to be punished with equal severity; that the
      knowledge of a mischievous intention, unless it be instantly
      revealed, becomes equally criminal with the intention itself; 19
      and that those rash men, who shall presume to solicit the pardon
      of traitors, shall themselves be branded with public and
      perpetual infamy. III. “With regard to the sons of the traitors,”
      (continues the emperor,) “although they ought to share the
      punishment, since they will probably imitate the guilt, of their
      parents, yet, by the special effect of our Imperial lenity, we
      grant them their lives; but, at the same time, we declare them
      incapable of inheriting, either on the father’s or on the
      mother’s side, or of receiving any gift or legacy, from the
      testament either of kinsmen or of strangers. Stigmatized with
      hereditary infamy, excluded from the hopes of honors or fortune,
      let them endure the pangs of poverty and contempt, till they
      shall consider life as a calamity, and death as a comfort and
      relief.” In such words, so well adapted to insult the feelings of
      mankind, did the emperor, or rather his favorite eunuch, applaud
      the moderation of a law, which transferred the same unjust and
      inhuman penalties to the children of all those who had seconded,
      or who had not disclosed, their fictitious conspiracies. Some of
      the noblest regulations of Roman jurisprudence have been suffered
      to expire; but this edict, a convenient and forcible engine of
      ministerial tyranny, was carefully inserted in the codes of
      Theodosius and Justinian; and the same maxims have been revived
      in modern ages, to protect the electors of Germany, and the
      cardinals of the church of Rome. 20

      alteration of the title, from murder to treason, was an
      improvement of the subtle Tribonian. Godefroy, in a formal
      dissertation, which he has inserted in his Commentary,
      illustrates this law of Arcadius, and explains all the difficult

      Yet these sanguinary laws, which spread terror among a disarmed
      and dispirited people, were of too weak a texture to restrain the
      bold enterprise of Tribigild 21 the Ostrogoth. The colony of that
      warlike nation, which had been planted by Theodosius in one of
      the most fertile districts of Phrygia, 22 impatiently compared
      the slow returns of laborious husbandry with the successful
      rapine and liberal rewards of Alaric; and their leader resented,
      as a personal affront, his own ungracious reception in the palace
      of Constantinople. A soft and wealthy province, in the heart of
      the empire, was astonished by the sound of war; and the faithful
      vassal who had been disregarded or oppressed, was again
      respected, as soon as he resumed the hostile character of a
      Barbarian. The vineyards and fruitful fields, between the rapid
      Marsyas and the winding Maeander, 23 were consumed with fire; the
      decayed walls of the cities crumbled into dust, at the first
      stroke of an enemy; the trembling inhabitants escaped from a
      bloody massacre to the shores of the Hellespont; and a
      considerable part of Asia Minor was desolated by the rebellion of
      Tribigild. His rapid progress was checked by the resistance of
      the peasants of Pamphylia; and the Ostrogoths, attacked in a
      narrow pass, between the city of Selgae, 24 a deep morass, and
      the craggy cliffs of Mount Taurus, were defeated with the loss of
      their bravest troops. But the spirit of their chief was not
      daunted by misfortune; and his army was continually recruited by
      swarms of Barbarians and outlaws, who were desirous of exercising
      the profession of robbery, under the more honorable names of war
      and conquest. The rumors of the success of Tribigild might for
      some time be suppressed by fear, or disguised by flattery; yet
      they gradually alarmed both the court and the capital. Every
      misfortune was exaggerated in dark and doubtful hints; and the
      future designs of the rebels became the subject of anxious
      conjecture. Whenever Tribigild advanced into the inland country,
      the Romans were inclined to suppose that he meditated the passage
      of Mount Taurus, and the invasion of Syria. If he descended
      towards the sea, they imputed, and perhaps suggested, to the
      Gothic chief, the more dangerous project of arming a fleet in the
      harbors of Ionia, and of extending his depredations along the
      maritime coast, from the mouth of the Nile to the port of
      Constantinople. The approach of danger, and the obstinacy of
      Tribigild, who refused all terms of accommodation, compelled
      Eutropius to summon a council of war. 25 After claiming for
      himself the privilege of a veteran soldier, the eunuch intrusted
      the guard of Thrace and the Hellespont to Gainas the Goth, and
      the command of the Asiatic army to his favorite, Leo; two
      generals, who differently, but effectually, promoted the cause of
      the rebels. Leo, 26 who, from the bulk of his body, and the
      dulness of his mind, was surnamed the Ajax of the East, had
      deserted his original trade of a woolcomber, to exercise, with
      much less skill and success, the military profession; and his
      uncertain operations were capriciously framed and executed, with
      an ignorance of real difficulties, and a timorous neglect of
      every favorable opportunity. The rashness of the Ostrogoths had
      drawn them into a disadvantageous position between the Rivers
      Melas and Eurymedon, where they were almost besieged by the
      peasants of Pamphylia; but the arrival of an Imperial army,
      instead of completing their destruction, afforded the means of
      safety and victory. Tribigild surprised the unguarded camp of the
      Romans, in the darkness of the night; seduced the faith of the
      greater part of the Barbarian auxiliaries, and dissipated,
      without much effort, the troops, which had been corrupted by the
      relaxation of discipline, and the luxury of the capital. The
      discontent of Gainas, who had so boldly contrived and executed
      the death of Rufinus, was irritated by the fortune of his
      unworthy successor; he accused his own dishonorable patience
      under the servile reign of a eunuch; and the ambitious Goth was
      convicted, at least in the public opinion, of secretly fomenting
      the revolt of Tribigild, with whom he was connected by a
      domestic, as well as by a national alliance. 27 When Gainas
      passed the Hellespont, to unite under his standard the remains of
      the Asiatic troops, he skilfully adapted his motions to the
      wishes of the Ostrogoths; abandoning, by his retreat, the country
      which they desired to invade; or facilitating, by his approach,
      the desertion of the Barbarian auxiliaries. To the Imperial court
      he repeatedly magnified the valor, the genius, the inexhaustible
      resources of Tribigild; confessed his own inability to prosecute
      the war; and extorted the permission of negotiating with his
      invincible adversary. The conditions of peace were dictated by
      the haughty rebel; and the peremptory demand of the head of
      Eutropius revealed the author and the design of this hostile
      conspiracy.

      Chapter XXXII: Emperors Arcadius, Eutropius, Theodosius II.—Part
      II.

      The bold satirist, who has indulged his discontent by the partial
      and passionate censure of the Christian emperors, violates the
      dignity, rather than the truth, of history, by comparing the son
      of Theodosius to one of those harmless and simple animals, who
      scarcely feel that they are the property of their shepherd. Two
      passions, however, fear and conjugal affection, awakened the
      languid soul of Arcadius: he was terrified by the threats of a
      victorious Barbarian; and he yielded to the tender eloquence of
      his wife Eudoxia, who, with a flood of artificial tears,
      presenting her infant children to their father, implored his
      justice for some real or imaginary insult, which she imputed to
      the audacious eunuch. 28 The emperor’s hand was directed to sign
      the condemnation of Eutropius; the magic spell, which during four
      years had bound the prince and the people, was instantly
      dissolved; and the acclamations that so lately hailed the merit
      and fortune of the favorite, were converted into the clamors of
      the soldiers and people, who reproached his crimes, and pressed
      his immediate execution. In this hour of distress and despair,
      his only refuge was in the sanctuary of the church, whose
      privileges he had wisely or profanely attempted to circumscribe;
      and the most eloquent of the saints, John Chrysostom, enjoyed the
      triumph of protecting a prostrate minister, whose choice had
      raised him to the ecclesiastical throne of Constantinople. The
      archbishop, ascending the pulpit of the cathedral, that he might
      be distinctly seen and heard by an innumerable crowd of either
      sex and of every age, pronounced a seasonable and pathetic
      discourse on the forgiveness of injuries, and the instability of
      human greatness. The agonies of the pale and affrighted wretch,
      who lay grovelling under the table of the altar, exhibited a
      solemn and instructive spectacle; and the orator, who was
      afterwards accused of insulting the misfortunes of Eutropius,
      labored to excite the contempt, that he might assuage the fury,
      of the people. 29 The powers of humanity, of superstition, and of
      eloquence, prevailed. The empress Eudoxia was restrained by her
      own prejudices, or by those of her subjects, from violating the
      sanctuary of the church; and Eutropius was tempted to capitulate,
      by the milder arts of persuasion, and by an oath, that his life
      should be spared. 30 Careless of the dignity of their sovereign,
      the new ministers of the palace immediately published an edict to
      declare, that his late favorite had disgraced the names of consul
      and patrician, to abolish his statues, to confiscate his wealth,
      and to inflict a perpetual exile in the Island of Cyprus. 31 A
      despicable and decrepit eunuch could no longer alarm the fears of
      his enemies; nor was he capable of enjoying what yet remained,
      the comforts of peace, of solitude, and of a happy climate. But
      their implacable revenge still envied him the last moments of a
      miserable life, and Eutropius had no sooner touched the shores of
      Cyprus, than he was hastily recalled. The vain hope of eluding,
      by a change of place, the obligation of an oath, engaged the
      empress to transfer the scene of his trial and execution from
      Constantinople to the adjacent suburb of Chalcedon. The consul
      Aurelian pronounced the sentence; and the motives of that
      sentence expose the jurisprudence of a despotic government. The
      crimes which Eutropius had committed against the people might
      have justified his death; but he was found guilty of harnessing
      to his chariot the sacred animals, who, from their breed or
      color, were reserved for the use of the emperor alone. 32

      28 (return) [ This anecdote, which Philostorgius alone has
      preserved, (l xi. c. 6, and Gothofred. Dissertat. p. 451-456) is

      with the secret intrigues of the palace.]

      tom. xiii. p. 135) too hastily supposes that Tribigild was
      actually in Constantinople; and that he commanded the soldiers
      who were ordered to seize Eutropius Even Claudian, a Pagan poet,
      (praefat. ad l. ii. in Eutrop. 27,) has mentioned the flight of

      contrary, pretends, that his enemies forced him from the
      sanctuary. Yet the promise is an evidence of some treaty; and the
      strong assurance of Claudian, (Praefat. ad l. ii. 46,) Sed tamen
      exemplo non feriere tuo, may be considered as an evidence of some
      promise.]

      While this domestic revolution was transacted, Gainas 33 openly
      revolted from his allegiance; united his forces at Thyatira in
      Lydia, with those of Tribigild; and still maintained his superior
      ascendant over the rebellious leader of the Ostrogoths. The
      confederate armies advanced, without resistance, to the straits
      of the Hellespont and the Bosphorus; and Arcadius was instructed
      to prevent the loss of his Asiatic dominions, by resigning his
      authority and his person to the faith of the Barbarians. The
      church of the holy martyr Euphemia, situate on a lofty eminence
      near Chalcedon, 34 was chosen for the place of the interview.
      Gainas bowed with reverence at the feet of the emperor, whilst he
      required the sacrifice of Aurelian and Saturninus, two ministers
      of consular rank; and their naked necks were exposed, by the
      haughty rebel, to the edge of the sword, till he condescended to
      grant them a precarious and disgraceful respite. The Goths,
      according to the terms of the agreement, were immediately
      transported from Asia into Europe; and their victorious chief,
      who accepted the title of master-general of the Roman armies,
      soon filled Constantinople with his troops, and distributed among
      his dependants the honors and rewards of the empire. In his early
      youth, Gainas had passed the Danube as a suppliant and a
      fugitive: his elevation had been the work of valor and fortune;
      and his indiscreet or perfidious conduct was the cause of his
      rapid downfall. Notwithstanding the vigorous opposition of the
      archbishop, he importunately claimed for his Arian sectaries the
      possession of a peculiar church; and the pride of the Catholics
      was offended by the public toleration of heresy. 35 Every quarter
      of Constantinople was filled with tumult and disorder; and the
      Barbarians gazed with such ardor on the rich shops of the
      jewellers, and the tables of the bankers, which were covered with
      gold and silver, that it was judged prudent to remove those
      dangerous temptations from their sight. They resented the
      injurious precaution; and some alarming attempts were made,
      during the night, to attack and destroy with fire the Imperial
      palace. 36 In this state of mutual and suspicious hostility, the
      guards and the people of Constantinople shut the gates, and rose
      in arms to prevent or to punish the conspiracy of the Goths.
      During the absence of Gainas, his troops were surprised and
      oppressed; seven thousand Barbarians perished in this bloody
      massacre. In the fury of the pursuit, the Catholics uncovered the
      roof, and continued to throw down flaming logs of wood, till they
      overwhelmed their adversaries, who had retreated to the church or
      conventicle of the Arians. Gainas was either innocent of the
      design, or too confident of his success; he was astonished by the
      intelligence that the flower of his army had been ingloriously
      destroyed; that he himself was declared a public enemy; and that
      his countryman, Fravitta, a brave and loyal confederate, had
      assumed the management of the war by sea and land. The
      enterprises of the rebel, against the cities of Thrace, were
      encountered by a firm and well-ordered defence; his hungry
      soldiers were soon reduced to the grass that grew on the margin
      of the fortifications; and Gainas, who vainly regretted the
      wealth and luxury of Asia, embraced a desperate resolution of
      forcing the passage of the Hellespont. He was destitute of
      vessels; but the woods of the Chersonesus afforded materials for
      rafts, and his intrepid Barbarians did not refuse to trust
      themselves to the waves. But Fravitta attentively watched the
      progress of their undertaking. As soon as they had gained the
      middle of the stream, the Roman galleys, 37 impelled by the full
      force of oars, of the current, and of a favorable wind, rushed
      forwards in compact order, and with irresistible weight; and the
      Hellespont was covered with the fragments of the Gothic
      shipwreck. After the destruction of his hopes, and the loss of
      many thousands of his bravest soldiers, Gainas, who could no
      longer aspire to govern or to subdue the Romans, determined to
      resume the independence of a savage life. A light and active body
      of Barbarian horse, disengaged from their infantry and baggage,
      might perform in eight or ten days a march of three hundred miles
      from the Hellespont to the Danube; 38 the garrisons of that
      important frontier had been gradually annihilated; the river, in
      the month of December, would be deeply frozen; and the unbounded
      prospect of Scythia was opened to the ambition of Gainas. This
      design was secretly communicated to the national troops, who
      devoted themselves to the fortunes of their leader; and before
      the signal of departure was given, a great number of provincial
      auxiliaries, whom he suspected of an attachment to their native
      country, were perfidiously massacred. The Goths advanced, by
      rapid marches, through the plains of Thrace; and they were soon
      delivered from the fear of a pursuit, by the vanity of Fravitta,
      3811 who, instead of extinguishing the war, hastened to enjoy the
      popular applause, and to assume the peaceful honors of the
      consulship. But a formidable ally appeared in arms to vindicate
      the majesty of the empire, and to guard the peace and liberty of
      Scythia. 39 The superior forces of Uldin, king of the Huns,
      opposed the progress of Gainas; a hostile and ruined country
      prohibited his retreat; he disdained to capitulate; and after
      repeatedly attempting to cut his way through the ranks of the
      enemy, he was slain, with his desperate followers, in the field
      of battle. Eleven days after the naval victory of the Hellespont,
      the head of Gainas, the inestimable gift of the conqueror, was
      received at Constantinople with the most liberal expressions of
      gratitude; and the public deliverance was celebrated by festivals
      and illuminations. The triumphs of Arcadius became the subject of
      epic poems; 40 and the monarch, no longer oppressed by any
      hostile terrors, resigned himself to the mild and absolute
      dominion of his wife, the fair and artful Eudoxia, who was
      sullied her fame by the persecution of St. John Chrysostom.

      After the death of the indolent Nectarius, the successor of
      Gregory Nazianzen, the church of Constantinople was distracted by
      the ambition of rival candidates, who were not ashamed to
      solicit, with gold or flattery, the suffrage of the people, or of
      the favorite. On this occasion Eutropius seems to have deviated
      from his ordinary maxims; and his uncorrupted judgment was
      determined only by the superior merit of a stranger. In a late
      journey into the East, he had admired the sermons of John, a
      native and presbyter of Antioch, whose name has been
      distinguished by the epithet of Chrysostom, or the Golden Mouth.
      41 A private order was despatched to the governor of Syria; and
      as the people might be unwilling to resign their favorite
      preacher, he was transported, with speed and secrecy in a
      post-chariot, from Antioch to Constantinople. The unanimous and
      unsolicited consent of the court, the clergy, and the people,
      ratified the choice of the minister; and, both as a saint and as
      an orator, the new archbishop surpassed the sanguine expectations
      of the public. Born of a noble and opulent family, in the capital
      of Syria, Chrysostom had been educated, by the care of a tender
      mother, under the tuition of the most skilful masters. He studied
      the art of rhetoric in the school of Libanius; and that
      celebrated sophist, who soon discovered the talents of his
      disciple, ingenuously confessed that John would have deserved to
      succeed him, had he not been stolen away by the Christians. His
      piety soon disposed him to receive the sacrament of baptism; to
      renounce the lucrative and honorable profession of the law; and
      to bury himself in the adjacent desert, where he subdued the
      lusts of the flesh by an austere penance of six years. His
      infirmities compelled him to return to the society of mankind;
      and the authority of Meletius devoted his talents to the service
      of the church: but in the midst of his family, and afterwards on
      the archiepiscopal throne, Chrysostom still persevered in the
      practice of the monastic virtues. The ample revenues, which his
      predecessors had consumed in pomp and luxury, he diligently
      applied to the establishment of hospitals; and the multitudes,
      who were supported by his charity, preferred the eloquent and
      edifying discourses of their archbishop to the amusements of the
      theatre or the circus. The monuments of that eloquence, which was
      admired near twenty years at Antioch and Constantinople, have
      been carefully preserved; and the possession of near one thousand
      sermons, or homilies has authorized the critics 42 of succeeding
      times to appreciate the genuine merit of Chrysostom. They
      unanimously attribute to the Christian orator the free command of
      an elegant and copious language; the judgment to conceal the
      advantages which he derived from the knowledge of rhetoric and
      philosophy; an inexhaustible fund of metaphors and similitudes of
      ideas and images, to vary and illustrate the most familiar
      topics; the happy art of engaging the passions in the service of
      virtue; and of exposing the folly, as well as the turpitude, of
      vice, almost with the truth and spirit of a dramatic
      representation.

      41 (return) [ The sixth book of Socrates, the eighth of Sozomen,
      and the fifth of Theodoret, afford curious and authentic
      materials for the life of John Chrysostom. Besides those general
      historians, I have taken for my guides the four principal
      biographers of the saint. 1. The author of a partial and
      passionate Vindication of the archbishop of Constantinople,
      composed in the form of a dialogue, and under the name of his
      zealous partisan, Palladius, bishop of Helenopolis, (Tillemont,
      Mem. Eccles. tom. xi. p. 500-533.) It is inserted among the works
      of Chrysostom. tom. xiii. p. 1-90, edit. Montfaucon. 2. The
      moderate Erasmus, (tom. iii. epist. Mcl. p. 1331-1347, edit.
      Lugd. Bat.) His vivacity and good sense were his own; his errors,
      in the uncultivated state of ecclesiastical antiquity, were
      almost inevitable. 3. The learned Tillemont, (Mem.
      Ecclesiastiques, tom. xi. p. 1-405, 547-626, &c. &c.,) who
      compiles the lives of the saints with incredible patience and
      religious accuracy. He has minutely searched the voluminous works
      of Chrysostom himself. 4. Father Montfaucon, who has perused
      those works with the curious diligence of an editor, discovered
      several new homilies, and again reviewed and composed the Life of
      Chrysostom, (Opera Chrysostom. tom. xiii. p. 91-177.)]

      42 (return) [ As I am almost a stranger to the voluminous sermons
      of Chrysostom, I have given my confidence to the two most
      judicious and moderate of the ecclesiastical critics, Erasmus
      (tom. iii. p. 1344) and Dupin, (Bibliothèque Ecclesiastique, tom.
      iii. p. 38:) yet the good taste of the former is sometimes
      vitiated by an excessive love of antiquity; and the good sense of
      the latter is always restrained by prudential considerations.]

      The pastoral labors of the archbishop of Constantinople provoked,
      and gradually united against him, two sorts of enemies; the
      aspiring clergy, who envied his success, and the obstinate
      sinners, who were offended by his reproofs. When Chrysostom
      thundered, from the pulpit of St. Sophia, against the degeneracy
      of the Christians, his shafts were spent among the crowd, without
      wounding, or even marking, the character of any individual. When
      he declaimed against the peculiar vices of the rich, poverty
      might obtain a transient consolation from his invectives; but the
      guilty were still sheltered by their numbers; and the reproach
      itself was dignified by some ideas of superiority and enjoyment.
      But as the pyramid rose towards the summit, it insensibly
      diminished to a point; and the magistrates, the ministers, the
      favorite eunuchs, the ladies of the court, 43 the empress Eudoxia
      herself, had a much larger share of guilt to divide among a
      smaller proportion of criminals. The personal applications of the
      audience were anticipated, or confirmed, by the testimony of
      their own conscience; and the intrepid preacher assumed the
      dangerous right of exposing both the offence and the offender to
      the public abhorrence. The secret resentment of the court
      encouraged the discontent of the clergy and monks of
      Constantinople, who were too hastily reformed by the fervent zeal
      of their archbishop. He had condemned, from the pulpit, the
      domestic females of the clergy of Constantinople, who, under the
      name of servants, or sisters, afforded a perpetual occasion
      either of sin or of scandal. The silent and solitary ascetics,
      who had secluded themselves from the world, were entitled to the
      warmest approbation of Chrysostom; but he despised and
      stigmatized, as the disgrace of their holy profession, the crowd
      of degenerate monks, who, from some unworthy motives of pleasure
      or profit, so frequently infested the streets of the capital. To
      the voice of persuasion, the archbishop was obliged to add the
      terrors of authority; and his ardor, in the exercise of
      ecclesiastical jurisdiction, was not always exempt from passion;
      nor was it always guided by prudence. Chrysostom was naturally of
      a choleric disposition. 44 Although he struggled, according to
      the precepts of the gospel, to love his private enemies, he
      indulged himself in the privilege of hating the enemies of God
      and of the church; and his sentiments were sometimes delivered
      with too much energy of countenance and expression. He still
      maintained, from some considerations of health or abstinence, his
      former habits of taking his repasts alone; and this inhospitable
      custom, 45 which his enemies imputed to pride, contributed, at
      least, to nourish the infirmity of a morose and unsocial humor.
      Separated from that familiar intercourse, which facilitates the
      knowledge and the despatch of business, he reposed an
      unsuspecting confidence in his deacon Serapion; and seldom
      applied his speculative knowledge of human nature to the
      particular character, either of his dependants, or of his equals.

      Conscious of the purity of his intentions, and perhaps of the
      superiority of his genius, the archbishop of Constantinople
      extended the jurisdiction of the Imperial city, that he might
      enlarge the sphere of his pastoral labors; and the conduct which
      the profane imputed to an ambitious motive, appeared to
      Chrysostom himself in the light of a sacred and indispensable
      duty. In his visitation through the Asiatic provinces, he deposed
      thirteen bishops of Lydia and Phrygia; and indiscreetly declared
      that a deep corruption of simony and licentiousness had infected
      the whole episcopal order. 46 If those bishops were innocent,
      such a rash and unjust condemnation must excite a well-grounded
      discontent. If they were guilty, the numerous associates of their
      guilt would soon discover that their own safety depended on the
      ruin of the archbishop; whom they studied to represent as the
      tyrant of the Eastern church.

      43 (return) [ The females of Constantinople distinguished
      themselves by their enmity or their attachment to Chrysostom.
      Three noble and opulent widows, Marsa, Castricia, and Eugraphia,
      were the leaders of the persecution, (Pallad. Dialog. tom. xiii.
      p. 14.) It was impossible that they should forgive a preacher who
      reproached their affectation to conceal, by the ornaments of
      dress, their age and ugliness, (Pallad p. 27.) Olympias, by equal
      zeal, displayed in a more pious cause, has obtained the title of
      saint. See Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xi p. 416-440.]

      44 (return) [ Sozomen, and more especially Socrates, have defined
      the real character of Chrysostom with a temperate and impartial
      freedom, very offensive to his blind admirers. Those historians
      lived in the next generation, when party violence was abated, and
      had conversed with many persons intimately acquainted with the
      virtues and imperfections of the saint.]

      45 (return) [ Palladius (tom. xiii. p. 40, &c.) very seriously
      defends the archbishop 1. He never tasted wine. 2. The weakness
      of his stomach required a peculiar diet. 3. Business, or study,
      or devotion, often kept him fasting till sunset. 4. He detested
      the noise and levity of great dinners. 5. He saved the expense
      for the use of the poor. 6. He was apprehensive, in a capital
      like Constantinople, of the envy and reproach of partial
      invitations.]

      46 (return) [ Chrysostom declares his free opinion (tom. ix. hom.
      iii in Act. Apostol. p. 29) that the number of bishops, who might
      be saved, bore a very small proportion to those who would be
      damned.]

      This ecclesiastical conspiracy was managed by Theophilus, 47
      archbishop of Alexandria, an active and ambitious prelate, who
      displayed the fruits of rapine in monuments of ostentation. His
      national dislike to the rising greatness of a city which degraded
      him from the second to the third rank in the Christian world, was
      exasperated by some personal dispute with Chrysostom himself. 48
      By the private invitation of the empress, Theophilus landed at
      Constantinople with a stou body of Egyptian mariners, to
      encounter the populace; and a train of dependent bishops, to
      secure, by their voices, the majority of a synod. The synod 49
      was convened in the suburb of Chalcedon, surnamed the Oak, where
      Rufinus had erected a stately church and monastery; and their
      proceedings were continued during fourteen days, or sessions. A
      bishop and a deacon accused the archbishop of Constantinople; but
      the frivolous or improbable nature of the forty-seven articles
      which they presented against him, may justly be considered as a
      fair and unexceptional panegyric. Four successive summons were
      signified to Chrysostom; but he still refused to trust either his
      person or his reputation in the hands of his implacable enemies,
      who, prudently declining the examination of any particular
      charges, condemned his contumacious disobedience, and hastily
      pronounced a sentence of deposition. The synod of the Oak
      immediately addressed the emperor to ratify and execute their
      judgment, and charitably insinuated, that the penalties of
      treason might be inflicted on the audacious preacher, who had
      reviled, under the name of Jezebel, the empress Eudoxia herself.
      The archbishop was rudely arrested, and conducted through the
      city, by one of the Imperial messengers, who landed him, after a
      short navigation, near the entrance of the Euxine; from whence,
      before the expiration of two days, he was gloriously recalled.

      48 (return) [ I have purposely omitted the controversy which
      arose among the monks of Egypt, concerning Origenism and
      Anthropomorphism; the dissimulation and violence of Theophilus;

      persecution and flight of the long, or tall, brothers; the
      ambiguous support which they received at Constantinople from
      Chrysostom, &c. &c.]

      49 (return) [ Photius (p. 53-60) has preserved the original acts
      of the synod of the Oak; which destroys the false assertion, that
      Chrysostom was condemned by no more than thirty-six bishops, of
      whom twenty-nine were Egyptians. Forty-five bishops subscribed
      his sentence. See Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom. xi. p. 595. *
      Note: Tillemont argues strongly for the number of thirty-six—M]

      The first astonishment of his faithful people had been mute and
      passive: they suddenly rose with unanimous and irresistible fury.
      Theophilus escaped, but the promiscuous crowd of monks and
      Egyptian mariners was slaughtered without pity in the streets of
      Constantinople. 50 A seasonable earthquake justified the
      interposition of Heaven; the torrent of sedition rolled forwards
      to the gates of the palace; and the empress, agitated by fear or
      remorse, threw herself at the feet of Arcadius, and confessed
      that the public safety could be purchased only by the restoration
      of Chrysostom. The Bosphorus was covered with innumerable
      vessels; the shores of Europe and Asia were profusely
      illuminated; and the acclamations of a victorious people
      accompanied, from the port to the cathedral, the triumph of the
      archbishop; who, too easily, consented to resume the exercise of
      his functions, before his sentence had been legally reversed by
      the authority of an ecclesiastical synod. Ignorant, or careless,
      of the impending danger, Chrysostom indulged his zeal, or perhaps
      his resentment; declaimed with peculiar asperity against female
      vices; and condemned the profane honors which were addressed,
      almost in the precincts of St. Sophia, to the statue of the
      empress. His imprudence tempted his enemies to inflame the
      haughty spirit of Eudoxia, by reporting, or perhaps inventing,
      the famous exordium of a sermon, “Herodias is again furious;
      Herodias again dances; she once more requires the head of John;”
      an insolent allusion, which, as a woman and a sovereign, it was
      impossible for her to forgive. 51 The short interval of a
      perfidious truce was employed to concert more effectual measures
      for the disgrace and ruin of the archbishop. A numerous council
      of the Eastern prelates, who were guided from a distance by the
      advice of Theophilus, confirmed the validity, without examining
      the justice, of the former sentence; and a detachment of
      Barbarian troops was introduced into the city, to suppress the
      emotions of the people. On the vigil of Easter, the solemn
      administration of baptism was rudely interrupted by the soldiers,
      who alarmed the modesty of the naked catechumens, and violated,
      by their presence, the awful mysteries of the Christian worship.
      Arsacius occupied the church of St. Sophia, and the
      archiepiscopal throne. The Catholics retreated to the baths of
      Constantine, and afterwards to the fields; where they were still
      pursued and insulted by the guards, the bishops, and the
      magistrates. The fatal day of the second and final exile of
      Chrysostom was marked by the conflagration of the cathedral, of
      the senate-house, and of the adjacent buildings; and this
      calamity was imputed, without proof, but not without probability,
      to the despair of a persecuted faction. 52

      Constantinople had found Theophilus, they would certainly have
      thrown him into the sea. Socrates mentions (l. vi. c. 17) a
      battle between the mob and the sailors of Alexandria, in which
      many wounds were given, and some lives were lost. The massacre of
      the monks is observed only by the Pagan Zosimus, (l. v. p. 324,)

      famous words, is rejected as spurious. Montfaucon, tom. xiii. p.
      151. Tillemont, Mem. Eccles. tom xi. p. 603.]

      52 (return) [ We might naturally expect such a charge from
      Zosimus, (l. v. p. 327;) but it is remarkable enough, that it
      should be confirmed by Socrates, (l. vi. c. 18,) and the Paschal
      Chronicle, (p. 307.)]

      Cicero might claim some merit, if his voluntary banishment
      preserved the peace of the republic; 53 but the submission of
      Chrysostom was the indispensable duty of a Christian and a
      subject. Instead of listening to his humble prayer, that he might
      be permitted to reside at Cyzicus, or Nicomedia, the inflexible
      empress assigned for his exile the remote and desolate town of
      Cucusus, among the ridges of Mount Taurus, in the Lesser Armenia.
      A secret hope was entertained, that the archbishop might perish
      in a difficult and dangerous march of seventy days, in the heat
      of summer, through the provinces of Asia Minor, where he was
      continually threatened by the hostile attacks of the Isaurians,
      and the more implacable fury of the monks. Yet Chrysostom arrived
      in safety at the place of his confinement; and the three years
      which he spent at Cucusus, and the neighboring town of Arabissus,
      were the last and most glorious of his life. His character was
      consecrated by absence and persecution; the faults of his
      administration were no longer remembered; but every tongue
      repeated the praises of his genius and virtue: and the respectful
      attention of the Christian world was fixed on a desert spot among
      the mountains of Taurus. From that solitude the archbishop, whose
      active mind was invigorated by misfortunes, maintained a strict
      and frequent correspondence 54 with the most distant provinces;
      exhorted the separate congregation of his faithful adherents to
      persevere in their allegiance; urged the destruction of the
      temples of Phoenicia, and the extirpation of heresy in the Isle
      of Cyprus; extended his pastoral care to the missions of Persia
      and Scythia; negotiated, by his ambassadors, with the Roman
      pontiff and the emperor Honorius; and boldly appealed, from a
      partial synod, to the supreme tribunal of a free and general
      council. The mind of the illustrious exile was still independent;
      but his captive body was exposed to the revenge of the
      oppressors, who continued to abuse the name and authority of
      Arcadius. 55 An order was despatched for the instant removal of
      Chrysostom to the extreme desert of Pityus: and his guards so
      faithfully obeyed their cruel instructions, that, before he
      reached the sea-coast of the Euxine, he expired at Comana, in
      Pontus, in the sixtieth year of his age. The succeeding
      generation acknowledged his innocence and merit. The archbishops
      of the East, who might blush that their predecessors had been the
      enemies of Chrysostom, were gradually disposed, by the firmness
      of the Roman pontiff, to restore the honors of that venerable
      name. 56 At the pious solicitation of the clergy and people of
      Constantinople, his relics, thirty years after his death, were
      transported from their obscure sepulchre to the royal city. 57
      The emperor Theodosius advanced to receive them as far as
      Chalcedon; and, falling prostrate on the coffin, implored, in the
      name of his guilty parents, Arcadius and Eudoxia, the forgiveness
      of the injured saint. 58

      of mind much superior to that of Cicero in his exile. The
      fourteenth epistle contains a curious narrative of the dangers of
      his journey.]

      Chrysostom had delivered his soul to be adulterated by the devil;
      and wishes that some further punishment, adequate (if possible)
      to the magnitude of his crimes, may be inflicted on him. St.

      Chapter XXXII: Emperors Arcadius, Eutropius, Theodosius II.—Part
      III.

      Yet a reasonable doubt may be entertained, whether any stain of
      hereditary guilt could be derived from Arcadius to his successor.
      Eudoxia was a young and beautiful woman, who indulged her
      passions, and despised her husband; Count John enjoyed, at least,
      the familiar confidence of the empress; and the public named him
      as the real father of Theodosius the younger. 59 The birth of a
      son was accepted, however, by the pious husband, as an event the
      most fortunate and honorable to himself, to his family, and to
      the Eastern world: and the royal infant, by an unprecedented
      favor, was invested with the titles of Caesar and Augustus. In
      less than four years afterwards, Eudoxia, in the bloom of youth,
      was destroyed by the consequences of a miscarriage; and this
      untimely death confounded the prophecy of a holy bishop, 60 who,
      amidst the universal joy, had ventured to foretell, that she
      should behold the long and auspicious reign of her glorious son.
      The Catholics applauded the justice of Heaven, which avenged the
      persecution of St. Chrysostom; and perhaps the emperor was the
      only person who sincerely bewailed the loss of the haughty and
      rapacious Eudoxia. Such a domestic misfortune afflicted him more
      deeply than the public calamities of the East; 61 the licentious
      excursions, from Pontus to Palestine, of the Isaurian robbers,
      whose impunity accused the weakness of the government; and the
      earthquakes, the conflagrations, the famine, and the flights of
      locusts, 62 which the popular discontent was equally disposed to
      attribute to the incapacity of the monarch. At length, in the
      thirty-first year of his age, after a reign (if we may abuse that
      word) of thirteen years, three months, and fifteen days, Arcadius
      expired in the palace of Constantinople. It is impossible to
      delineate his character; since, in a period very copiously
      furnished with historical materials, it has not been possible to
      remark one action that properly belongs to the son of the great
      Theodosius.

      The historian Procopius 63 has indeed illuminated the mind of the
      dying emperor with a ray of human prudence, or celestial wisdom.
      Arcadius considered, with anxious foresight, the helpless
      condition of his son Theodosius, who was no more than seven years
      of age, the dangerous factions of a minority, and the aspiring
      spirit of Jezdegerd, the Persian monarch. Instead of tempting the
      allegiance of an ambitious subject, by the participation of
      supreme power, he boldly appealed to the magnanimity of a king;
      and placed, by a solemn testament, the sceptre of the East in the
      hands of Jezdegerd himself. The royal guardian accepted and
      discharged this honorable trust with unexampled fidelity; and the
      infancy of Theodosius was protected by the arms and councils of
      Persia. Such is the singular narrative of Procopius; and his
      veracity is not disputed by Agathias, 64 while he presumes to
      dissent from his judgment, and to arraign the wisdom of a
      Christian emperor, who, so rashly, though so fortunately,
      committed his son and his dominions to the unknown faith of a
      stranger, a rival, and a heathen. At the distance of one hundred
      and fifty years, this political question might be debated in the
      court of Justinian; but a prudent historian will refuse to
      examine the propriety, till he has ascertained the truth, of the
      testament of Arcadius. As it stands without a parallel in the
      history of the world, we may justly require, that it should be
      attested by the positive and unanimous evidence of
      contemporaries. The strange novelty of the event, which excites
      our distrust, must have attracted their notice; and their
      universal silence annihilates the vain tradition of the
      succeeding age.

      Empereurs, tom. vi. p. 597) argues very sensibly on the merits of
      this fable. His criticism was not warped by any ecclesiastical
      authority: both Procopius and Agathias are half Pagans. * Note:

      The maxims of Roman jurisprudence, if they could fairly be
      transferred from private property to public dominion, would have
      adjudged to the emperor Honorius the guardianship of his nephew,
      till he had attained, at least, the fourteenth year of his age.
      But the weakness of Honorius, and the calamities of his reign,
      disqualified him from prosecuting this natural claim; and such
      was the absolute separation of the two monarchies, both in
      interest and affection, that Constantinople would have obeyed,
      with less reluctance, the orders of the Persian, than those of
      the Italian, court. Under a prince whose weakness is disguised by
      the external signs of manhood and discretion, the most worthless
      favorites may secretly dispute the empire of the palace; and
      dictate to submissive provinces the commands of a master, whom
      they direct and despise. But the ministers of a child, who is
      incapable of arming them with the sanction of the royal name,
      must acquire and exercise an independent authority. The great
      officers of the state and army, who had been appointed before the
      death of Arcadius, formed an aristocracy, which might have
      inspired them with the idea of a free republic; and the
      government of the Eastern empire was fortunately assumed by the
      præfect Anthemius, 65 who obtained, by his superior abilities, a
      lasting ascendant over the minds of his equals. The safety of the
      young emperor proved the merit and integrity of Anthemius; and
      his prudent firmness sustained the force and reputation of an
      infant reign. Uldin, with a formidable host of Barbarians, was
      encamped in the heart of Thrace; he proudly rejected all terms of
      accommodation; and, pointing to the rising sun, declared to the
      Roman ambassadors, that the course of that planet should alone
      terminate the conquest of the Huns. But the desertion of his
      confederates, who were privately convinced of the justice and
      liberality of the Imperial ministers, obliged Uldin to repass the
      Danube: the tribe of the Scyrri, which composed his rear-guard,
      was almost extirpated; and many thousand captives were dispersed
      to cultivate, with servile labor, the fields of Asia. 66 In the
      midst of the public triumph, Constantinople was protected by a
      strong enclosure of new and more extensive walls; the same
      vigilant care was applied to restore the fortifications of the
      Illyrian cities; and a plan was judiciously conceived, which, in
      the space of seven years, would have secured the command of the
      Danube, by establishing on that river a perpetual fleet of two
      hundred and fifty armed vessels. 67

      But the Romans had so long been accustomed to the authority of a
      monarch, that the first, even among the females, of the Imperial
      family, who displayed any courage or capacity, was permitted to
      ascend the vacant throne of Theodosius. His sister Pulcheria, 68
      who was only two years older than himself, received, at the age
      of sixteen, the title of Augusta; and though her favor might be
      sometimes clouded by caprice or intrigue, she continued to govern
      the Eastern empire near forty years; during the long minority of
      her brother, and after his death, in her own name, and in the
      name of Marcian, her nominal husband. From a motive either of
      prudence or religion, she embraced a life of celibacy; and
      notwithstanding some aspersions on the chastity of Pulcheria, 69
      this resolution, which she communicated to her sisters Arcadia
      and Marina, was celebrated by the Christian world, as the sublime
      effort of heroic piety. In the presence of the clergy and people,
      the three daughters of Arcadius 70 dedicated their virginity to
      God; and the obligation of their solemn vow was inscribed on a
      tablet of gold and gems; which they publicly offered in the great
      church of Constantinople. Their palace was converted into a
      monastery; and all males, except the guides of their conscience,
      the saints who had forgotten the distinction of sexes, were
      scrupulously excluded from the holy threshold. Pulcheria, her two
      sisters, and a chosen train of favorite damsels, formed a
      religious community: they denounced the vanity of dress;
      interrupted, by frequent fasts, their simple and frugal diet;
      allotted a portion of their time to works of embroidery; and
      devoted several hours of the day and night to the exercises of
      prayer and psalmody. The piety of a Christian virgin was adorned
      by the zeal and liberality of an empress. Ecclesiastical history
      describes the splendid churches, which were built at the expense
      of Pulcheria, in all the provinces of the East; her charitable
      foundations for the benefit of strangers and the poor; the ample
      donations which she assigned for the perpetual maintenance of
      monastic societies; and the active severity with which she
      labored to suppress the opposite heresies of Nestorius and
      Eutyches. Such virtues were supposed to deserve the peculiar
      favor of the Deity: and the relics of martyrs, as well as the
      knowledge of future events, were communicated in visions and
      revelations to the Imperial saint. 71 Yet the devotion of
      Pulcheria never diverted her indefatigable attention from
      temporal affairs; and she alone, among all the descendants of the
      great Theodosius, appears to have inherited any share of his
      manly spirit and abilities. The elegant and familiar use which
      she had acquired, both of the Greek and Latin languages, was
      readily applied to the various occasions of speaking or writing,
      on public business: her deliberations were maturely weighed; her
      actions were prompt and decisive; and, while she moved, without
      noise or ostentation, the wheel of government, she discreetly
      attributed to the genius of the emperor the long tranquillity of
      his reign. In the last years of his peaceful life, Europe was
      indeed afflicted by the arms of war; but the more extensive
      provinces of Asia still continued to enjoy a profound and
      permanent repose. Theodosius the younger was never reduced to the
      disgraceful necessity of encountering and punishing a rebellious
      subject: and since we cannot applaud the vigor, some praise may
      be due to the mildness and prosperity, of the administration of
      Pulcheria.

      empress. * Note: The heathen Eunapius gives a frightful picture

      brother Theodosius.]

      to a church of St. Thyrsus, erected by Caesarius, who was consul
      A.D. 397; and the memory of the relics was almost obliterated.
      Notwithstanding the charitable wishes of Dr. Jortin, (Remarks,
      tom. iv. p. 234,) it is not easy to acquit Pulcheria of some
      share in the pious fraud; which must have been transacted when
      she was more than five-and-thirty years of age.]

      The Roman world was deeply interested in the education of its
      master. A regular course of study and exercise was judiciously
      instituted; of the military exercises of riding, and shooting
      with the bow; of the liberal studies of grammar, rhetoric, and
      philosophy: the most skilful masters of the East ambitiously
      solicited the attention of their royal pupil; and several noble
      youths were introduced into the palace, to animate his diligence
      by the emulation of friendship. Pulcheria alone discharged the
      important task of instructing her brother in the arts of
      government; but her precepts may countenance some suspicions of
      the extent of her capacity, or of the purity of her intentions.
      She taught him to maintain a grave and majestic deportment; to
      walk, to hold his robes, to seat himself on his throne, in a
      manner worthy of a great prince; to abstain from laughter; to
      listen with condescension; to return suitable answers; to assume,
      by turns, a serious or a placid countenance: in a word, to
      represent with grace and dignity the external figure of a Roman
      emperor. But Theodosius 72 was never excited to support the
      weight and glory of an illustrious name: and, instead of aspiring
      to support his ancestors, he degenerated (if we may presume to
      measure the degrees of incapacity) below the weakness of his
      father and his uncle. Arcadius and Honorius had been assisted by
      the guardian care of a parent, whose lessons were enforced by his
      authority and example. But the unfortunate prince, who is born in
      the purple, must remain a stranger to the voice of truth; and the
      son of Arcadius was condemned to pass his perpetual infancy
      encompassed only by a servile train of women and eunuchs. The
      ample leisure which he acquired by neglecting the essential
      duties of his high office, was filled by idle amusements and
      unprofitable studies. Hunting was the only active pursuit that
      could tempt him beyond the limits of the palace; but he most
      assiduously labored, sometimes by the light of a midnight lamp,
      in the mechanic occupations of painting and carving; and the
      elegance with which he transcribed religious books entitled the
      Roman emperor to the singular epithet of Calligraphes, or a fair
      writer. Separated from the world by an impenetrable veil,
      Theodosius trusted the persons whom he loved; he loved those who
      were accustomed to amuse and flatter his indolence; and as he
      never perused the papers that were presented for the royal
      signature, the acts of injustice the most repugnant to his
      character were frequently perpetrated in his name. The emperor
      himself was chaste, temperate, liberal, and merciful; but these
      qualities, which can only deserve the name of virtues when they
      are supported by courage and regulated by discretion, were seldom
      beneficial, and they sometimes proved mischievous, to mankind.
      His mind, enervated by a royal education, was oppressed and
      degraded by abject superstition: he fasted, he sung psalms, he
      blindly accepted the miracles and doctrines with which his faith
      was continually nourished. Theodosius devoutly worshipped the
      dead and living saints of the Catholic church; and he once
      refused to eat, till an insolent monk, who had cast an
      excommunication on his sovereign, condescended to heal the
      spiritual wound which he had inflicted. 73

      72 (return) [ There is a remarkable difference between the two
      ecclesiastical historians, who in general bear so close a
      resemblance. Sozomen (l. ix. c. 1) ascribes to Pulcheria the
      government of the empire, and the education of her brother, whom
      he scarcely condescends to praise. Socrates, though he affectedly
      disclaims all hopes of favor or fame, composes an elaborate
      panegyric on the emperor, and cautiously suppresses the merits of
      his sister, (l. vii. c. 22, 42.) Philostorgius (l. xii. c. 7)
      expresses the influence of Pulcheria in gentle and courtly
      language. Suidas (Excerpt. p. 53) gives a true character of
      Theodosius; and I have followed the example of Tillemont (tom.
      vi. p. 25) in borrowing some strokes from the modern Greeks.]

      The story of a fair and virtuous maiden, exalted from a private
      condition to the Imperial throne, might be deemed an incredible
      romance, if such a romance had not been verified in the marriage
      of Theodosius. The celebrated Athenais 74 was educated by her
      father Leontius in the religion and sciences of the Greeks; and
      so advantageous was the opinion which the Athenian philosopher
      entertained of his contemporaries, that he divided his patrimony
      between his two sons, bequeathing to his daughter a small legacy
      of one hundred pieces of gold, in the lively confidence that her
      beauty and merit would be a sufficient portion. The jealousy and
      avarice of her brothers soon compelled Athenais to seek a refuge
      at Constantinople; and, with some hopes, either of justice or
      favor, to throw herself at the feet of Pulcheria. That sagacious
      princess listened to her eloquent complaint; and secretly
      destined the daughter of the philosopher Leontius for the future
      wife of the emperor of the East, who had now attained the
      twentieth year of his age. She easily excited the curiosity of
      her brother, by an interesting picture of the charms of Athenais;
      large eyes, a well-proportioned nose, a fair complexion, golden
      locks, a slender person, a graceful demeanor, an understanding
      improved by study, and a virtue tried by distress. Theodosius,
      concealed behind a curtain in the apartment of his sister, was
      permitted to behold the Athenian virgin: the modest youth
      immediately declared his pure and honorable love; and the royal
      nuptials were celebrated amidst the acclamations of the capital
      and the provinces. Athenais, who was easily persuaded to renounce
      the errors of Paganism, received at her baptism the Christian
      name of Eudocia; but the cautious Pulcheria withheld the title of
      Augusta, till the wife of Theodosius had approved her
      fruitfulness by the birth of a daughter, who espoused, fifteen
      years afterwards, the emperor of the West. The brothers of
      Eudocia obeyed, with some anxiety, her Imperial summons; but as
      she could easily forgive their unfortunate unkindness, she
      indulged the tenderness, or perhaps the vanity, of a sister, by
      promoting them to the rank of consuls and præfects. In the
      luxury of the palace, she still cultivated those ingenuous arts
      which had contributed to her greatness; and wisely dedicated her
      talents to the honor of religion, and of her husband. Eudocia
      composed a poetical paraphrase of the first eight books of the
      Old Testament, and of the prophecies of Daniel and Zechariah; a
      cento of the verses of Homer, applied to the life and miracles of
      Christ, the legend of St. Cyprian, and a panegyric on the Persian
      victories of Theodosius; and her writings, which were applauded
      by a servile and superstitious age, have not been disdained by
      the candor of impartial criticism. 75 The fondness of the emperor
      was not abated by time and possession; and Eudocia, after the
      marriage of her daughter, was permitted to discharge her grateful
      vows by a solemn pilgrimage to Jerusalem. Her ostentatious
      progress through the East may seem inconsistent with the spirit
      of Christian humility; she pronounced, from a throne of gold and
      gems, an eloquent oration to the senate of Antioch, declared her
      royal intention of enlarging the walls of the city, bestowed a
      donative of two hundred pounds of gold to restore the public
      baths, and accepted the statues, which were decreed by the
      gratitude of Antioch. In the Holy Land, her alms and pious
      foundations exceeded the munificence of the great Helena, and
      though the public treasure might be impoverished by this
      excessive liberality, she enjoyed the conscious satisfaction of
      returning to Constantinople with the chains of St. Peter, the
      right arm of St. Stephen, and an undoubted picture of the Virgin,
      painted by St. Luke. 76 But this pilgrimage was the fatal term of
      the glories of Eudocia. Satiated with empty pomp, and unmindful,
      perhaps, of her obligations to Pulcheria, she ambitiously aspired
      to the government of the Eastern empire; the palace was
      distracted by female discord; but the victory was at last
      decided, by the superior ascendant of the sister of Theodosius.
      The execution of Paulinus, master of the offices, and the
      disgrace of Cyrus, Prætorian præfect of the East, convinced the
      public that the favor of Eudocia was insufficient to protect her
      most faithful friends; and the uncommon beauty of Paulinus
      encouraged the secret rumor, that his guilt was that of a
      successful lover. 77 As soon as the empress perceived that the
      affection of Theodosius was irretrievably lost, she requested the
      permission of retiring to the distant solitude of Jerusalem. She
      obtained her request; but the jealousy of Theodosius, or the
      vindictive spirit of Pulcheria, pursued her in her last retreat;
      and Saturninus, count of the domestics, was directed to punish
      with death two ecclesiastics, her most favored servants. Eudocia
      instantly revenged them by the assassination of the count; the
      furious passions which she indulged on this suspicious occasion,
      seemed to justify the severity of Theodosius; and the empress,
      ignominiously stripped of the honors of her rank, 78 was
      disgraced, perhaps unjustly, in the eyes of the world. The
      remainder of the life of Eudocia, about sixteen years, was spent
      in exile and devotion; and the approach of age, the death of
      Theodosius, the misfortunes of her only daughter, who was led a
      captive from Rome to Carthage, and the society of the Holy Monks
      of Palestine, insensibly confirmed the religious temper of her
      mind. After a full experience of the vicissitudes of human life,
      the daughter of the philosopher Leontius expired, at Jerusalem,
      in the sixty-seventh year of her age; protesting, with her dying
      breath, that she had never transgressed the bounds of innocence
      and friendship. 79

      authors had probably seen original pictures of the empress
      Eudocia. The modern Greeks, Zonaras, Cedrenus, &c., have
      displayed the love, rather than the talent of fiction. From
      Nicephorus, indeed, I have ventured to assume her age. The writer
      of a romance would not have imagined, that Athenais was near
      twenty eight years old when she inflamed the heart of a young

      assigned by the latter, overturn a great part of the Greek
      fictions; and the celebrated story of the apple, &c., is fit only

      history of Antioch, John Malala becomes a writer of good
      authority. The Abbe Guenee, in a memoir on the fertility of
      Palestine, of which I have only seen an extract, calculates the
      gifts of Eudocia at 20,488 pounds of gold, above 800,000 pounds
      sterling.]

      The gentle mind of Theodosius was never inflamed by the ambition
      of conquest, or military renown; and the slight alarm of a
      Persian war scarcely interrupted the tranquillity of the East.
      The motives of this war were just and honorable. In the last year
      of the reign of Jezdegerd, the supposed guardian of Theodosius, a
      bishop, who aspired to the crown of martyrdom, destroyed one of
      the fire-temples of Susa. 80 His zeal and obstinacy were revenged
      on his brethren: the Magi excited a cruel persecution; and the
      intolerant zeal of Jezdegerd was imitated by his son Varanes, or
      Bahram, who soon afterwards ascended the throne. Some Christian
      fugitives, who escaped to the Roman frontier, were sternly
      demanded, and generously refused; and the refusal, aggravated by
      commercial disputes, soon kindled a war between the rival
      monarchies. The mountains of Armenia, and the plains of
      Mesopotamia, were filled with hostile armies; but the operations
      of two successive campaigns were not productive of any decisive
      or memorable events. Some engagements were fought, some towns
      were besieged, with various and doubtful success: and if the
      Romans failed in their attempt to recover the long-lost
      possession of Nisibis, the Persians were repulsed from the walls
      of a Mesopotamian city, by the valor of a martial bishop, who
      pointed his thundering engine in the name of St. Thomas the
      Apostle. Yet the splendid victories which the incredible speed of
      the messenger Palladius repeatedly announced to the palace of
      Constantinople, were celebrated with festivals and panegyrics.
      From these panegyrics the historians 81 of the age might borrow
      their extraordinary, and, perhaps, fabulous tales; of the proud
      challenge of a Persian hero, who was entangled by the net, and
      despatched by the sword, of Areobindus the Goth; of the ten
      thousand Immortals, who were slain in the attack of the Roman
      camp; and of the hundred thousand Arabs, or Saracens, who were
      impelled by a panic terror to throw themselves headlong into the
      Euphrates. Such events may be disbelieved or disregarded; but the
      charity of a bishop, Acacius of Amida, whose name might have
      dignified the saintly calendar, shall not be lost in oblivion.
      Boldly declaring, that vases of gold and silver are useless to a
      God who neither eats nor drinks, the generous prelate sold the
      plate of the church of Amida; employed the price in the
      redemption of seven thousand Persian captives; supplied their
      wants with affectionate liberality; and dismissed them to their
      native country, to inform their king of the true spirit of the
      religion which he persecuted. The practice of benevolence in the
      midst of war must always tend to assuage the animosity of
      contending nations; and I wish to persuade myself, that Acacius
      contributed to the restoration of peace. In the conference which
      was held on the limits of the two empires, the Roman ambassadors
      degraded the personal character of their sovereign, by a vain
      attempt to magnify the extent of his power; when they seriously
      advised the Persians to prevent, by a timely accommodation, the
      wrath of a monarch, who was yet ignorant of this distant war. A
      truce of one hundred years was solemnly ratified; and although
      the revolutions of Armenia might threaten the public
      tranquillity, the essential conditions of this treaty were
      respected near fourscore years by the successors of Constantine
      and Artaxerxes.

      Since the Roman and Parthian standards first encountered on the
      banks of the Euphrates, the kingdom of Armenia 82 was alternately
      oppressed by its formidable protectors; and in the course of this
      History, several events, which inclined the balance of peace and
      war, have been already related. A disgraceful treaty had resigned
      Armenia to the ambition of Sapor; and the scale of Persia
      appeared to preponderate. But the royal race of Arsaces
      impatiently submitted to the house of Sassan; the turbulent
      nobles asserted, or betrayed, their hereditary independence; and
      the nation was still attached to the Christian princes of
      Constantinople. In the beginning of the fifth century, Armenia
      was divided by the progress of war and faction; 83 and the
      unnatural division precipitated the downfall of that ancient
      monarchy. Chosroes, the Persian vassal, reigned over the Eastern
      and most extensive portion of the country; while the Western
      province acknowledged the jurisdiction of Arsaces, and the
      supremacy of the emperor Arcadius. 8111 After the death of
      Arsaces, the Romans suppressed the regal government, and imposed
      on their allies the condition of subjects. The military command
      was delegated to the count of the Armenian frontier; the city of
      Theodosiopolis 84 was built and fortified in a strong situation,
      on a fertile and lofty ground, near the sources of the Euphrates;
      and the dependent territories were ruled by five satraps, whose
      dignity was marked by a peculiar habit of gold and purple. The
      less fortunate nobles, who lamented the loss of their king, and
      envied the honors of their equals, were provoked to negotiate
      their peace and pardon at the Persian court; and returning, with
      their followers, to the palace of Artaxata, acknowledged Chosroes
      8411 for their lawful sovereign. About thirty years afterwards,
      Artasires, the nephew and successor of Chosroes, fell under the
      displeasure of the haughty and capricious nobles of Armenia; and
      they unanimously desired a Persian governor in the room of an
      unworthy king. The answer of the archbishop Isaac, whose sanction
      they earnestly solicited, is expressive of the character of a
      superstitious people. He deplored the manifest and inexcusable
      vices of Artasires; and declared, that he should not hesitate to
      accuse him before the tribunal of a Christian emperor, who would
      punish, without destroying, the sinner. “Our king,” continued
      Isaac, “is too much addicted to licentious pleasures, but he has
      been purified in the holy waters of baptism. He is a lover of
      women, but he does not adore the fire or the elements. He may
      deserve the reproach of lewdness, but he is an undoubted
      Catholic; and his faith is pure, though his manners are
      flagitious. I will never consent to abandon my sheep to the rage
      of devouring wolves; and you would soon repent your rash exchange
      of the infirmities of a believer, for the specious virtues of a
      heathen.” 85 Exasperated by the firmness of Isaac, the factious
      nobles accused both the king and the archbishop as the secret
      adherents of the emperor; and absurdly rejoiced in the sentence
      of condemnation, which, after a partial hearing, was solemnly
      pronounced by Bahram himself. The descendants of Arsaces were
      degraded from the royal dignity, 86 which they had possessed
      above five hundred and sixty years; 87 and the dominions of the
      unfortunate Artasires, 8711 under the new and significant
      appellation of Persarmenia, were reduced into the form of a
      province. This usurpation excited the jealousy of the Roman
      government; but the rising disputes were soon terminated by an
      amicable, though unequal, partition of the ancient kingdom of
      Armenia: 8712 and a territorial acquisition, which Augustus might
      have despised, reflected some lustre on the declining empire of
      the younger Theodosius.

      82 (return) [ This account of the ruin and division of the
      kingdom of Armenia is taken from the third book of the Armenian
      history of Moses of Chorene. Deficient as he is in every
      qualification of a good historian, his local information, his
      passions, and his prejudices are strongly expressive of a native
      and contemporary. Procopius (de Edificiis, l. iii. c. 1, 5)
      relates the same facts in a very different manner; but I have
      extracted the circumstances the most probable in themselves, and
      the least inconsistent with Moses of Chorene.]

      83 (return) [ The western Armenians used the Greek language and
      characters in their religious offices; but the use of that
      hostile tongue was prohibited by the Persians in the Eastern
      provinces, which were obliged to use the Syriac, till the
      invention of the Armenian letters by Mesrobes, in the beginning
      of the fifth century, and the subsequent version of the Bible
      into the Armenian language; an event which relaxed to the
      connection of the church and nation with Constantinople.]

      Ancienne, tom. ii. p. 99, 100.]

      8111 (return) [ The division of Armenia, according to M. St.
      Martin, took place much earlier, A. C. 390. The Eastern or
      Persian division was four times as large as the Western or Roman.
      This partition took place during the reigns of Theodosius the
      First, and Varanes (Bahram) the Fourth. St. Martin, Sup. to Le
      Beau, iv. 429. This partition was but imperfectly accomplished,
      as both parts were afterwards reunited under Chosroes, who paid
      tribute both to the Roman emperor and to the Persian king. v.
      439.—M.]

      8411 (return) [ Chosroes, according to Procopius (who calls him
      Arsaces, the common name of the Armenian kings) and the Armenian
      writers, bequeathed to his two sons, to Tigranes the Persian, to
      Arsaces the Roman, division of Armenia, A. C. 416. With the
      assistance of the discontented nobles the Persian king placed his
      son Sapor on the throne of the Eastern division; the Western at
      the same time was united to the Roman empire, and called the
      Greater Armenia. It was then that Theodosiopolis was built. Sapor
      abandoned the throne of Armenia to assert his rights to that of
      Persia; he perished in the struggle, and after a period of
      anarchy, Bahram V., who had ascended the throne of Persia, placed
      the last native prince, Ardaschir, son of Bahram Schahpour, on
      the throne of the Persian division of Armenia. St. Martin, v.
      506. This Ardaschir was the Artasires of Gibbon. The archbishop
      Isaac is called by the Armenians the Patriarch Schag. St. Martin,

      85 (return) [ Moses Choren, l. iii. c. 63, p. 316. According to
      the institution of St. Gregory, the Apostle of Armenia, the
      archbishop was always of the royal family; a circumstance which,
      in some degree, corrected the influence of the sacerdotal
      character, and united the mitre with the crown.]

      86 (return) [ A branch of the royal house of Arsaces still
      subsisted with the rank and possessions (as it should seem) of
      Armenian satraps. See Moses Choren. l. iii. c. 65, p. 321.]

      87 (return) [ Valarsaces was appointed king of Armenia by his
      brother the Parthian monarch, immediately after the defeat of
      Antiochus Sidetes, (Moses Choren. l. ii. c. 2, p. 85,) one
      hundred and thirty years before Christ. Without depending on the
      various and contradictory periods of the reigns of the last
      kings, we may be assured, that the ruin of the Armenian kingdom
      happened after the council of Chalcedon, A.D. 431, (l. iii. c.
      61, p. 312;) and under Varamus, or Bahram, king of Persia, (l.
      iii. c. 64, p. 317,) who reigned from A.D. 420 to 440. See
      Assemanni, Bibliot. Oriental. tom. iii. p. 396. * Note: Five
      hundred and eighty. St. Martin, ibid. He places this event A. C
      429.—M.——Note: According to M. St. Martin, vi. 32, Vagharschah,
      or Valarsaces, was appointed king by his brother Mithridates the
      Great, king of Parthia.—M.]
