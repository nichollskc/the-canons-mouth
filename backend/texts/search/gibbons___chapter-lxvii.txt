      The respective merits of Rome and Constantinople are compared and
      celebrated by an eloquent Greek, the father of the Italian
      schools. 1 The view of the ancient capital, the seat of his
      ancestors, surpassed the most sanguine expectations of Emanuel
      Chrysoloras; and he no longer blamed the exclamation of an old
      sophist, that Rome was the habitation, not of men, but of gods.
      Those gods, and those men, had long since vanished; but to the
      eye of liberal enthusiasm, the majesty of ruin restored the image
      of her ancient prosperity. The monuments of the consuls and
      Cæsars, of the martyrs and apostles, engaged on all sides the
      curiosity of the philosopher and the Christian; and he confessed
      that in every age the arms and the religion of Rome were destined
      to reign over the earth. While Chrysoloras admired the venerable
      beauties of the mother, he was not forgetful of his native
      country, her fairest daughter, her Imperial colony; and the
      Byzantine patriot expatiates with zeal and truth on the eternal
      advantages of nature, and the more transitory glories of art and
      dominion, which adorned, or had adorned, the city of Constantine.
      Yet the perfection of the copy still redounds (as he modestly
      observes) to the honor of the original, and parents are delighted
      to be renewed, and even excelled, by the superior merit of their
      children. “Constantinople,” says the orator, “is situate on a
      commanding point, between Europe and Asia, between the
      Archipelago and the Euxine. By her interposition, the two seas,
      and the two continents, are united for the common benefit of
      nations; and the gates of commerce may be shut or opened at her
      command. The harbor, encompassed on all sides by the sea, and the
      continent, is the most secure and capacious in the world. The
      walls and gates of Constantinople may be compared with those of
      Babylon: the towers many; each tower is a solid and lofty
      structure; and the second wall, the outer fortification, would be
      sufficient for the defence and dignity of an ordinary capital. A
      broad and rapid stream may be introduced into the ditches and the
      artificial island may be encompassed, like Athens, 2 by land or
      water.” Two strong and natural causes are alleged for the
      perfection of the model of new Rome. The royal founder reigned
      over the most illustrious nations of the globe; and in the
      accomplishment of his designs, the power of the Romans was
      combined with the art and science of the Greeks. Other cities
      have been reared to maturity by accident and time: their beauties
      are mingled with disorder and deformity; and the inhabitants,
      unwilling to remove from their natal spot, are incapable of
      correcting the errors of their ancestors, and the original vices
      of situation or climate. But the free idea of Constantinople was
      formed and executed by a single mind; and the primitive model was
      improved by the obedient zeal of the subjects and successors of
      the first monarch. The adjacent isles were stored with an
      inexhaustible supply of marble; but the various materials were
      transported from the most remote shores of Europe and Asia; and
      the public and private buildings, the palaces, churches,
      aqueducts, cisterns, porticos, columns, baths, and hippodromes,
      were adapted to the greatness of the capital of the East. The
      superfluity of wealth was spread along the shores of Europe and
      Asia; and the Byzantine territory, as far as the Euxine, the
      Hellespont, and the long wall, might be considered as a populous
      suburb and a perpetual garden. In this flattering picture, the
      past and the present, the times of prosperity and decay, are
      artfully confounded; but a sigh and a confession escape, from the
      orator, that his wretched country was the shadow and sepulchre of
      its former self. The works of ancient sculpture had been defaced
      by Christian zeal or Barbaric violence; the fairest structures
      were demolished; and the marbles of Paros or Numidia were burnt
      for lime, or applied to the meanest uses. Of many a statue, the
      place was marked by an empty pedestal; of many a column, the size
      was determined by a broken capital; the tombs of the emperors
      were scattered on the ground; the stroke of time was accelerated
      by storms and earthquakes; and the vacant space was adorned, by
      vulgar tradition, with fabulous monuments of gold and silver.
      From these wonders, which lived only in memory or belief, he
      distinguishes, however, the porphyry pillar, the column and
      colossus of Justinian, 3 and the church, more especially the
      dome, of St. Sophia; the best conclusion, since it could not be
      described according to its merits, and after it no other object
      could deserve to be mentioned. But he forgets that, a century
      before, the trembling fabrics of the colossus and the church had
      been saved and supported by the timely care of Andronicus the
      Elder. Thirty years after the emperor had fortified St. Sophia
      with two new buttresses or pyramids, the eastern hemisphere
      suddenly gave way: and the images, the altars, and the sanctuary,
      were crushed by the falling ruin. The mischief indeed was
      speedily repaired; the rubbish was cleared by the incessant labor
      of every rank and age; and the poor remains of riches and
      industry were consecrated by the Greeks to the most stately and
      venerable temple of the East. 4

      1 (return) [ The epistle of Emanuel Chrysoloras to the emperor
      John Palæologus will not offend the eye or ear of a classical
      student, (ad calcem Codini de Antiquitatibus C. P. p. 107—126.)
      The superscription suggests a chronological remark, that John
      Palæologus II. was associated in the empire before the year 1414,
      the date of Chrysoloras’s death. A still earlier date, at least
      1408, is deduced from the age of his youngest sons, Demetrius and
      Thomas, who were both _Porphyrogeniti_ (Ducange, Fam. Byzant. p.
      244, 247.)]

      2 (return) [ Somebody observed that the city of Athens might be
      circumnavigated, (tiV eipen tin polin tvn Aqhnaiwn dunasqai kai
      paraplein kai periplein.) But what may be true in a rhetorical
      sense of Constantinople, cannot be applied to the situation of
      Athens, five miles from the sea, and not intersected or
      surrounded by any navigable streams.]

      3 (return) [ Nicephorus Gregoras has described the Colossus of
      Justinian, (l. vii. 12:) but his measures are false and
      inconsistent. The editor Boivin consulted his friend Girardon;
      and the sculptor gave him the true proportions of an equestrian
      statue. That of Justinian was still visible to Peter Gyllius, not
      on the column, but in the outward court of the seraglio; and he
      was at Constantinople when it was melted down, and cast into a
      brass cannon, (de Topograph. C. P. l. ii. c. 17.)]

      4 (return) [ See the decay and repairs of St. Sophia, in
      Nicephorus Gregoras (l. vii. 12, l. xv. 2.) The building was
      propped by Andronicus in 1317, the eastern hemisphere fell in
      1345. The Greeks, in their pompous rhetoric, exalt the beauty and
      holiness of the church, an earthly heaven the abode of angels,
      and of God himself, &c.]

      The last hope of the falling city and empire was placed in the
      harmony of the mother and daughter, in the maternal tenderness of
      Rome, and the filial obedience of Constantinople. In the synod of
      Florence, the Greeks and Latins had embraced, and subscribed, and
      promised; but these signs of friendship were perfidious or
      fruitless; 5 and the baseless fabric of the union vanished like a
      dream. 6 The emperor and his prelates returned home in the
      Venetian galleys; but as they touched at the Morea and the Isles
      of Corfu and Lesbos, the subjects of the Latins complained that
      the pretended union would be an instrument of oppression. No
      sooner did they land on the Byzantine shore, than they were
      saluted, or rather assailed, with a general murmur of zeal and
      discontent. During their absence, above two years, the capital
      had been deprived of its civil and ecclesiastical rulers;
      fanaticism fermented in anarchy; the most furious monks reigned
      over the conscience of women and bigots; and the hatred of the
      Latin name was the first principle of nature and religion. Before
      his departure for Italy, the emperor had flattered the city with
      the assurance of a prompt relief and a powerful succor; and the
      clergy, confident in their orthodoxy and science, had promised
      themselves and their flocks an easy victory over the blind
      shepherds of the West. The double disappointment exasperated the
      Greeks; the conscience of the subscribing prelates was awakened;
      the hour of temptation was past; and they had more to dread from
      the public resentment, than they could hope from the favor of the
      emperor or the pope. Instead of justifying their conduct, they
      deplored their weakness, professed their contrition, and cast
      themselves on the mercy of God and of their brethren. To the
      reproachful question, what had been the event or the use of their
      Italian synod? they answered with sighs and tears, “Alas! we have
      made a new faith; we have exchanged piety for impiety; we have
      betrayed the immaculate sacrifice; and we are become _Azymites_.”
      (The Azymites were those who celebrated the communion with
      unleavened bread; and I must retract or qualify the praise which
      I have bestowed on the growing philosophy of the times.) “Alas!
      we have been seduced by distress, by fraud, and by the hopes and
      fears of a transitory life. The hand that has signed the union
      should be cut off; and the tongue that has pronounced the Latin
      creed deserves to be torn from the root.” The best proof of their
      repentance was an increase of zeal for the most trivial rites and
      the most incomprehensible doctrines; and an absolute separation
      from all, without excepting their prince, who preserved some
      regard for honor and consistency. After the decease of the
      patriarch Joseph, the archbishops of Heraclea and Trebizond had
      courage to refuse the vacant office; and Cardinal Bessarion
      preferred the warm and comfortable shelter of the Vatican. The
      choice of the emperor and his clergy was confined to Metrophanes
      of Cyzicus: he was consecrated in St. Sophia, but the temple was
      vacant. The cross-bearers abdicated their service; the infection
      spread from the city to the villages; and Metrophanes discharged,
      without effect, some ecclesiastical thunders against a nation of
      schismatics. The eyes of the Greeks were directed to Mark of
      Ephesus, the champion of his country; and the sufferings of the
      holy confessor were repaid with a tribute of admiration and
      applause. His example and writings propagated the flame of
      religious discord; age and infirmity soon removed him from the
      world; but the gospel of Mark was not a law of forgiveness; and
      he requested with his dying breath, that none of the adherents of
      Rome might attend his obsequies or pray for his soul.

      5 (return) [ The genuine and original narrative of Syropulus (p.
      312—351) opens the schism from the first _office_ of the Greeks
      at Venice to the general opposition at Constantinople, of the
      clergy and people.]

      6 (return) [ On the schism of Constantinople, see Phranza, (l.
      ii. c. 17,) Laonicus Chalcondyles, (l. vi. p. 155, 156,) and
      Ducas, (c. 31;) the last of whom writes with truth and freedom.
      Among the moderns we may distinguish the continuator of Fleury,
      (tom. xxii. p. 338, &c., 401, 420, &c.,) and Spondanus, (A.D.
      1440—50.) The sense of the latter is drowned in prejudice and
      passion, as soon as Rome and religion are concerned.]

      The schism was not confined to the narrow limits of the Byzantine
      empire. Secure under the Mamaluke sceptre, the three patriarchs
      of Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, assembled a numerous
      synod; disowned their representatives at Ferrara and Florence;
      condemned the creed and council of the Latins; and threatened the
      emperor of Constantinople with the censures of the Eastern
      church. Of the sectaries of the Greek communion, the Russians
      were the most powerful, ignorant, and superstitious. Their
      primate, the cardinal Isidore, hastened from Florence to Moscow,
      7 to reduce the independent nation under the Roman yoke. But the
      Russian bishops had been educated at Mount Athos; and the prince
      and people embraced the theology of their priests. They were
      scandalized by the title, the pomp, the Latin cross of the
      legate, the friend of those impious men who shaved their beards,
      and performed the divine office with gloves on their hands and
      rings on their fingers: Isidore was condemned by a synod; his
      person was imprisoned in a monastery; and it was with extreme
      difficulty that the cardinal could escape from the hands of a
      fierce and fanatic people. 8 The Russians refused a passage to
      the missionaries of Rome who aspired to convert the Pagans beyond
      the Tanais; 9 and their refusal was justified by the maxim, that
      the guilt of idolatry is less damnable than that of schism. The
      errors of the Bohemians were excused by their abhorrence for the
      pope; and a deputation of the Greek clergy solicited the
      friendship of those sanguinary enthusiasts. 10 While Eugenius
      triumphed in the union and orthodoxy of the Greeks, his party was
      contracted to the walls, or rather to the palace of
      Constantinople. The zeal of Palæologus had been excited by
      interest; it was soon cooled by opposition: an attempt to violate
      the national belief might endanger his life and crown; not could
      the pious rebels be destitute of foreign and domestic aid. The
      sword of his brother Demetrius, who in Italy had maintained a
      prudent and popular silence, was half unsheathed in the cause of
      religion; and Amurath, the Turkish sultan, was displeased and
      alarmed by the seeming friendship of the Greeks and Latins.

      7 (return) [ Isidore was metropolitan of Kiow, but the Greeks
      subject to Poland have removed that see from the ruins of Kiow to
      Lemberg, or Leopold, (Herbestein, in Ramusio, tom. ii. p. 127.)
      On the other hand, the Russians transferred their spiritual
      obedience to the archbishop, who became, in 1588, the patriarch,
      of Moscow, (Levesque Hist. de Russie, tom. iii. p. 188, 190, from
      a Greek MS. at Turin, Iter et labores Archiepiscopi Arsenii.)]

      8 (return) [ The curious narrative of Levesque (Hist. de Russie,
      tom. ii. p. 242—247) is extracted from the patriarchal archives.
      The scenes of Ferrara and Florence are described by ignorance and
      passion; but the Russians are credible in the account of their
      own prejudices.]

      9 (return) [ The Shamanism, the ancient religion of the Samanæans
      and Gymnosophists, has been driven by the more popular Bramins
      from India into the northern deserts: the naked philosophers were
      compelled to wrap themselves in fur; but they insensibly sunk
      into wizards and physicians. The Mordvans and Tcheremisses in the
      European Russia adhere to this religion, which is formed on the
      earthly model of one king or God, his ministers or angels, and
      the rebellious spirits who oppose his government. As these tribes
      of the Volga have no images, they might more justly retort on the
      Latin missionaries the name of idolaters, (Levesque, Hist. des
      Peuples soumis à la Domination des Russes, tom. i. p. 194—237,
      423—460.)]

      10 (return) [ Spondanus, Annal. Eccles. tom ii. A.D. 1451, No.
      13. The epistle of the Greeks with a Latin version, is extant in
      the college library at Prague.]

      “Sultan Murad, or Amurath, lived forty-nine, and reigned thirty
      years, six months, and eight days. He was a just and valiant
      prince, of a great soul, patient of labors, learned, merciful,
      religious, charitable; a lover and encourager of the studious,
      and of all who excelled in any art or science; a good emperor and
      a great general. No man obtained more or greater victories than
      Amurath; Belgrade alone withstood his attacks. 101 Under his
      reign, the soldier was ever victorious, the citizen rich and
      secure. If he subdued any country, his first care was to build
      mosques and caravansaras, hospitals, and colleges. Every year he
      gave a thousand pieces of gold to the sons of the Prophet; and
      sent two thousand five hundred to the religious persons of Mecca,
      Medina, and Jerusalem.” 11 This portrait is transcribed from the
      historian of the Othman empire: but the applause of a servile and
      superstitious people has been lavished on the worst of tyrants;
      and the virtues of a sultan are often the vices most useful to
      himself, or most agreeable to his subjects. A nation ignorant of
      the equal benefits of liberty and law, must be awed by the
      flashes of arbitrary power: the cruelty of a despot will assume
      the character of justice; his profusion, of liberality; his
      obstinacy, of firmness. If the most reasonable excuse be
      rejected, few acts of obedience will be found impossible; and
      guilt must tremble, where innocence cannot always be secure. The
      tranquillity of the people, and the discipline of the troops,
      were best maintained by perpetual action in the field; war was
      the trade of the Janizaries; and those who survived the peril,
      and divided the spoil, applauded the generous ambition of their
      sovereign. To propagate the true religion, was the duty of a
      faithful Mussulman: the unbelievers were _his_ enemies, and those
      of the Prophet; and, in the hands of the Turks, the cimeter was
      the only instrument of conversion. Under these circumstances,
      however, the justice and moderation of Amurath are attested by
      his conduct, and acknowledged by the Christians themselves; who
      consider a prosperous reign and a peaceful death as the reward of
      his singular merits. In the vigor of his age and military power,
      he seldom engaged in war till he was justified by a previous and
      adequate provocation: the victorious sultan was disarmed by
      submission; and in the observance of treaties, his word was
      inviolate and sacred. 12 The Hungarians were commonly the
      aggressors; he was provoked by the revolt of Scanderbeg; and the
      perfidious Caramanian was twice vanquished, and twice pardoned,
      by the Ottoman monarch. Before he invaded the Morea, Thebes had
      been surprised by the despot: in the conquest of Thessalonica,
      the grandson of Bajazet might dispute the recent purchase of the
      Venetians; and after the first siege of Constantinople, the
      sultan was never tempted, by the distress, the absence, or the
      injuries of Palæologus, to extinguish the dying light of the
      Byzantine empire.

      101 (return) [ See the siege and massacre at Thessalonica. Von
      Hammer vol. i p. 433.—M.]

      11 (return) [ See Cantemir, History of the Othman Empire, p. 94.
      Murad, or Morad, may be more correct: but I have preferred the
      popular name to that obscure diligence which is rarely successful
      in translating an Oriental, into the Roman, alphabet.]

      12 (return) [ See Chalcondyles, (l. vii. p. 186, 198,) Ducas, (c.
      33,) and Marinus Barletius, (in Vit. Scanderbeg, p. 145, 146.) In
      his good faith towards the garrison of Sfetigrade, he was a
      lesson and example to his son Mahomet.]

      But the most striking feature in the life and character of
      Amurath is the double abdication of the Turkish throne; and, were
      not his motives debased by an alloy of superstition, we must
      praise the royal philosopher, 13 who at the age of forty could
      discern the vanity of human greatness. Resigning the sceptre to
      his son, he retired to the pleasant residence of Magnesia; but he
      retired to the society of saints and hermits. It was not till the
      fourth century of the Hegira, that the religion of Mahomet had
      been corrupted by an institution so adverse to his genius; but in
      the age of the crusades, the various orders of Dervises were
      multiplied by the example of the Christian, and even the Latin,
      monks. 14 The lord of nations submitted to fast, and pray, and
      turn round 141 in endless rotation with the fanatics, who mistook
      the giddiness of the head for the illumination of the spirit. 15
      But he was soon awakened from his dreams of enthusiasm by the
      Hungarian invasion; and his obedient son was the foremost to urge
      the public danger and the wishes of the people. Under the banner
      of their veteran leader, the Janizaries fought and conquered but
      he withdrew from the field of Varna, again to pray, to fast, and
      to turn round with his Magnesian brethren. These pious
      occupations were again interrupted by the danger of the state. A
      victorious army disdained the inexperience of their youthful
      ruler: the city of Adrianople was abandoned to rapine and
      slaughter; and the unanimous divan implored his presence to
      appease the tumult, and prevent the rebellion, of the Janizaries.
      At the well-known voice of their master, they trembled and
      obeyed; and the reluctant sultan was compelled to support his
      splendid servitude, till at the end of four years, he was
      relieved by the angel of death. Age or disease, misfortune or
      caprice, have tempted several princes to descend from the throne;
      and they have had leisure to repent of their irretrievable step.
      But Amurath alone, in the full liberty of choice, after the trial
      of empire and solitude, has _repeated_ his preference of a
      private life.

      13 (return) [ Voltaire (Essai sur l’Histoire Générale, c. 89, p.
      283, 284) admires _le Philosophe Turc:_ would he have bestowed
      the same praise on a Christian prince for retiring to a
      monastery? In his way, Voltaire was a bigot, an intolerant
      bigot.]

      14 (return) [ See the articles _Dervische_, _Fakir_, _Nasser_,
      _Rohbaniat_, in D’Herbelot’s Bibliothèque Orientale. Yet the
      subject is superficially treated from the Persian and Arabian
      writers. It is among the Turks that these orders have principally
      flourished.]

      141 (return) [ Gibbon has fallen into a remarkable error. The
      unmonastic retreat of Amurath was that of an epicurean rather
      than of a dervis; more like that of Sardanapalus than of Charles
      the Fifth. Profane, not divine, love was its chief occupation:
      the only dance, that described by Horace as belonging to the
      country, motus doceri gaudet Ionicos. See Von Hammer note, p.
      652.—M.]

      15 (return) [ Ricaut (in the Present State of the Ottoman Empire,
      p. 242—268) affords much information, which he drew from his
      personal conversation with the heads of the dervises, most of
      whom ascribed their origin to the time of Orchan. He does not
      mention the _Zichid_ of Chalcondyles, (l. vii. p. 286,) among
      whom Amurath retired: the _Seids_ of that author are the
      descendants of Mahomet.]

      After the departure of his Greek brethren, Eugenius had not been
      unmindful of their temporal interest; and his tender regard for
      the Byzantine empire was animated by a just apprehension of the
      Turks, who approached, and might soon invade, the borders of
      Italy. But the spirit of the crusades had expired; and the
      coldness of the Franks was not less unreasonable than their
      headlong passion. In the eleventh century, a fanatic monk could
      precipitate Europe on Asia for the recovery of the holy
      sepulchre; but in the fifteenth, the most pressing motives of
      religion and policy were insufficient to unite the Latins in the
      defence of Christendom. Germany was an inexhaustible storehouse
      of men and arms: 16 but that complex and languid body required
      the impulse of a vigorous hand; and Frederic the Third was alike
      impotent in his personal character and his Imperial dignity. A
      long war had impaired the strength, without satiating the
      animosity, of France and England: 17 but Philip duke of Burgundy
      was a vain and magnificent prince; and he enjoyed, without danger
      or expense, the adventurous piety of his subjects, who sailed, in
      a gallant fleet, from the coast of Flanders to the Hellespont.
      The maritime republics of Venice and Genoa were less remote from
      the scene of action; and their hostile fleets were associated
      under the standard of St. Peter. The kingdoms of Hungary and
      Poland, which covered as it were the interior pale of the Latin
      church, were the most nearly concerned to oppose the progress of
      the Turks. Arms were the patrimony of the Scythians and
      Sarmatians; and these nations might appear equal to the contest,
      could they point, against the common foe, those swords that were
      so wantonly drawn in bloody and domestic quarrels. But the same
      spirit was adverse to concord and obedience: a poor country and a
      limited monarch are incapable of maintaining a standing force;
      and the loose bodies of Polish and Hungarian horse were not armed
      with the sentiments and weapons which, on some occasions, have
      given irresistible weight to the French chivalry. Yet, on this
      side, the designs of the Roman pontiff, and the eloquence of
      Cardinal Julian, his legate, were promoted by the circumstances
      of the times: 18 by the union of the two crowns on the head of
      Ladislaus, 19 a young and ambitious soldier; by the valor of a
      hero, whose name, the name of John Huniades, was already popular
      among the Christians, and formidable to the Turks. An endless
      treasure of pardons and indulgences was scattered by the legate;
      many private warriors of France and Germany enlisted under the
      holy banner; and the crusade derived some strength, or at least
      some reputation, from the new allies both of Europe and Asia. A
      fugitive despot of Servia exaggerated the distress and ardor of
      the Christians beyond the Danube, who would unanimously rise to
      vindicate their religion and liberty. The Greek emperor, 20 with
      a spirit unknown to his fathers, engaged to guard the Bosphorus,
      and to sally from Constantinople at the head of his national and
      mercenary troops. The sultan of Caramania 21 announced the
      retreat of Amurath, and a powerful diversion in the heart of
      Anatolia; and if the fleets of the West could occupy at the same
      moment the Straits of the Hellespont, the Ottoman monarchy would
      be dissevered and destroyed. Heaven and earth must rejoice in the
      perdition of the miscreants; and the legate, with prudent
      ambiguity, instilled the opinion of the invisible, perhaps the
      visible, aid of the Son of God, and his divine mother.

      knights of Rhodes must connect them with the sultan of
      Caramania.]

      Of the Polish and Hungarian diets, a religious war was the
      unanimous cry; and Ladislaus, after passing the Danube, led an
      army of his confederate subjects as far as Sophia, the capital of
      the Bulgarian kingdom. In this expedition they obtained two
      signal victories, which were justly ascribed to the valor and
      conduct of Huniades. In the first, with a vanguard of ten
      thousand men, he surprised the Turkish camp; in the second, he
      vanquished and made prisoner the most renowned of their generals,
      who possessed the double advantage of ground and numbers. The
      approach of winter, and the natural and artificial obstacles of
      Mount Hæmus, arrested the progress of the hero, who measured a
      narrow interval of six days’ march from the foot of the mountains
      to the hostile towers of Adrianople, and the friendly capital of
      the Greek empire. The retreat was undisturbed; and the entrance
      into Buda was at once a military and religious triumph. An
      ecclesiastical procession was followed by the king and his
      warriors on foot: he nicely balanced the merits and rewards of
      the two nations; and the pride of conquest was blended with the
      humble temper of Christianity. Thirteen bashaws, nine standards,
      and four thousand captives, were unquestionable trophies; and as
      all were willing to believe, and none were present to contradict,
      the crusaders multiplied, with unblushing confidence, the myriads
      of Turks whom they had left on the field of battle. 22 The most
      solid proof, and the most salutary consequence, of victory, was a
      deputation from the divan to solicit peace, to restore Servia, to
      ransom the prisoners, and to evacuate the Hungarian frontier. By
      this treaty, the rational objects of the war were obtained: the
      king, the despot, and Huniades himself, in the diet of Segedin,
      were satisfied with public and private emolument; a truce of ten
      years was concluded; and the followers of Jesus and Mahomet, who
      swore on the Gospel and the Koran, attested the word of God as
      the guardian of truth and the avenger of perfidy. In the place of
      the Gospel, the Turkish ministers had proposed to substitute the
      Eucharist, the real presence of the Catholic deity; but the
      Christians refused to profane their holy mysteries; and a
      superstitious conscience is less forcibly bound by the spiritual
      energy, than by the outward and visible symbols of an oath. 23

      22 (return) [ In their letters to the emperor Frederic III. the
      Hungarians slay 80,000 Turks in one battle; but the modest Julian
      reduces the slaughter to 6000 or even 2000 infidels, (Æneas
      Sylvius in Europ. c. 5, and epist. 44, 81, apud Spondanum.)]

      23 (return) [ See the origin of the Turkish war, and the first
      expedition of Ladislaus, in the vth and vith books of the iiid
      decad of Bonfinius, who, in his division and style, copies Livy
      with tolerable success Callimachus (l. ii p. 487—496) is still
      more pure and authentic.]

      During the whole transaction, the cardinal legate had observed a
      sullen silence, unwilling to approve, and unable to oppose, the
      consent of the king and people. But the diet was not dissolved
      before Julian was fortified by the welcome intelligence, that
      Anatolia was invaded by the Caramanian, and Thrace by the Greek
      emperor; that the fleets of Genoa, Venice, and Burgundy, were
      masters of the Hellespont; and that the allies, informed of the
      victory, and ignorant of the treaty, of Ladislaus, impatiently
      waited for the return of his victorious army. “And is it thus,”
      exclaimed the cardinal, 24 “that you will desert their
      expectations and your own fortune? It is to them, to your God,
      and your fellow-Christians, that you have pledged your faith; and
      that prior obligation annihilates a rash and sacrilegious oath to
      the enemies of Christ. His vicar on earth is the Roman pontiff;
      without whose sanction you can neither promise nor perform. In
      his name I absolve your perjury and sanctify your arms: follow my
      footsteps in the paths of glory and salvation; and if still ye
      have scruples, devolve on my head the punishment and the sin.”
      This mischievous casuistry was seconded by his respectable
      character, and the levity of popular assemblies: war was
      resolved, on the same spot where peace had so lately been sworn;
      and, in the execution of the treaty, the Turks were assaulted by
      the Christians; to whom, with some reason, they might apply the
      epithet of Infidels. The falsehood of Ladislaus to his word and
      oath was palliated by the religion of the times: the most
      perfect, or at least the most popular, excuse would have been the
      success of his arms and the deliverance of the Eastern church.
      But the same treaty which should have bound his conscience had
      diminished his strength. On the proclamation of the peace, the
      French and German volunteers departed with indignant murmurs: the
      Poles were exhausted by distant warfare, and perhaps disgusted
      with foreign command; and their palatines accepted the first
      license, and hastily retired to their provinces and castles. Even
      Hungary was divided by faction, or restrained by a laudable
      scruple; and the relics of the crusade that marched in the second
      expedition were reduced to an inadequate force of twenty thousand
      men. A Walachian chief, who joined the royal standard with his
      vassals, presumed to remark that their numbers did not exceed the
      hunting retinue that sometimes attended the sultan; and the gift
      of two horses of matchless speed might admonish Ladislaus of his
      secret foresight of the event. But the despot of Servia, after
      the restoration of his country and children, was tempted by the
      promise of new realms; and the inexperience of the king, the
      enthusiasm of the legate, and the martial presumption of Huniades
      himself, were persuaded that every obstacle must yield to the
      invincible virtue of the sword and the cross. After the passage
      of the Danube, two roads might lead to Constantinople and the
      Hellespont: the one direct, abrupt, and difficult through the
      mountains of Hæmus; the other more tedious and secure, over a
      level country, and along the shores of the Euxine; in which their
      flanks, according to the Scythian discipline, might always be
      covered by a movable fortification of wagons. The latter was
      judiciously preferred: the Catholics marched through the plains
      of Bulgaria, burning, with wanton cruelty, the churches and
      villages of the Christian natives; and their last station was at
      Warna, near the sea-shore; on which the defeat and death of
      Ladislaus have bestowed a memorable name. 25

      other historians, who might indulge their own eloquence, while
      they represent one of the orators of the age. But they all agree
      in the advice and arguments for perjury, which in the field of
      controversy are fiercely attacked by the Protestants, and feebly
      defended by the Catholics. The latter are discouraged by the
      misfortune of Warna.]

      stadia, or furlongs, from the mouth of the Danube, 2140 from
      Byzantium, and 360 to the north of a ridge of promontory of Mount
      Hæmus, which advances into the sea.]




      Chapter LXVII: Schism Of The Greeks And Latins.—Part II.

      It was on this fatal spot, that, instead of finding a confederate
      fleet to second their operations, they were alarmed by the
      approach of Amurath himself, who had issued from his Magnesian
      solitude, and transported the forces of Asia to the defence of
      Europe. According to some writers, the Greek emperor had been
      awed, or seduced, to grant the passage of the Bosphorus; and an
      indelible stain of corruption is fixed on the Genoese, or the
      pope’s nephew, the Catholic admiral, whose mercenary connivance
      betrayed the guard of the Hellespont. From Adrianople, the sultan
      advanced by hasty marches, at the head of sixty thousand men; and
      when the cardinal, and Huniades, had taken a nearer survey of the
      numbers and order of the Turks, these ardent warriors proposed
      the tardy and impracticable measure of a retreat. The king alone
      was resolved to conquer or die; and his resolution had almost
      been crowned with a glorious and salutary victory. The princes
      were opposite to each other in the centre; and the Beglerbegs, or
      generals of Anatolia and Romania, commanded on the right and
      left, against the adverse divisions of the despot and Huniades.
      The Turkish wings were broken on the first onset: but the
      advantage was fatal; and the rash victors, in the heat of the
      pursuit, were carried away far from the annoyance of the enemy,
      or the support of their friends. When Amurath beheld the flight
      of his squadrons, he despaired of his fortune and that of the
      empire: a veteran Janizary seized his horse’s bridle; and he had
      magnanimity to pardon and reward the soldier who dared to
      perceive the terror, and arrest the flight, of his sovereign. A
      copy of the treaty, the monument of Christian perfidy, had been
      displayed in the front of battle; and it is said, that the sultan
      in his distress, lifting his eyes and his hands to heaven,
      implored the protection of the God of truth; and called on the
      prophet Jesus himself to avenge the impious mockery of his name
      and religion. 26 With inferior numbers and disordered ranks, the
      king of Hungary rushed forward in the confidence of victory, till
      his career was stopped by the impenetrable phalanx of the
      Janizaries. If we may credit the Ottoman annals, his horse was
      pierced by the javelin of Amurath; 27 he fell among the spears of
      the infantry; and a Turkish soldier proclaimed with a loud voice,
      “Hungarians, behold the head of your king!” The death of
      Ladislaus was the signal of their defeat. On his return from an
      intemperate pursuit, Huniades deplored his error, and the public
      loss; he strove to rescue the royal body, till he was overwhelmed
      by the tumultuous crowd of the victors and vanquished; and the
      last efforts of his courage and conduct were exerted to save the
      remnant of his Walachian cavalry. Ten thousand Christians were
      slain in the disastrous battle of Warna: the loss of the Turks,
      more considerable in numbers, bore a smaller proportion to their
      total strength; yet the philosophic sultan was not ashamed to
      confess, that his ruin must be the consequence of a second and
      similar victory. 271 At his command a column was erected on the
      spot where Ladislaus had fallen; but the modest inscription,
      instead of accusing the rashness, recorded the valor, and
      bewailed the misfortune, of the Hungarian youth. 28

      Segnia, (ad calcem Cuspinian. de Cæsaribus, p. 716—722,)
      represents the theatre of the war in the xvth century.]

      Before I lose sight of the field of Warna, I am tempted to pause
      on the character and story of two principal actors, the cardinal
      Julian and John Huniades. Julian 29 Cæsarini was born of a noble
      family of Rome: his studies had embraced both the Latin and Greek
      learning, both the sciences of divinity and law; and his
      versatile genius was equally adapted to the schools, the camp,
      and the court. No sooner had he been invested with the Roman
      purple, than he was sent into Germany to arm the empire against
      the rebels and heretics of Bohemia. The spirit of persecution is
      unworthy of a Christian; the military profession ill becomes a
      priest; but the former is excused by the times; and the latter
      was ennobled by the courage of Julian, who stood dauntless and
      alone in the disgraceful flight of the German host. As the pope’s
      legate, he opened the council of Basil; but the president soon
      appeared the most strenuous champion of ecclesiastical freedom;
      and an opposition of seven years was conducted by his ability and
      zeal. After promoting the strongest measures against the
      authority and person of Eugenius, some secret motive of interest
      or conscience engaged him to desert on a sudden the popular
      party. The cardinal withdrew himself from Basil to Ferrara; and,
      in the debates of the Greeks and Latins, the two nations admired
      the dexterity of his arguments and the depth of his theological
      erudition. 30 In his Hungarian embassy, we have already seen the
      mischievous effects of his sophistry and eloquence, of which
      Julian himself was the first victim. The cardinal, who performed
      the duties of a priest and a soldier, was lost in the defeat of
      Warna. The circumstances of his death are variously related; but
      it is believed, that a weighty encumbrance of gold impeded his
      flight, and tempted the cruel avarice of some Christian
      fugitives.

      Concile de Basle, tom. i. p. 247, &c.) and Bohemian campaign (p.
      315, &c.) of Cardinal Julian. His services at Basil and Ferrara,
      and his unfortunate end, are occasionally related by Spondanus,
      and the continuator of Fleury.]

      30 (return) [ Syropulus honorably praises the talent of an enemy,
      (p. 117:) toiauta tina eipen o IoulianoV peplatusmenwV agan kai
      logikwV, kai met episthmhV kai deinothtoV 'RhtprikhV.]

      From an humble, or at least a doubtful origin, the merit of John
      Huniades promoted him to the command of the Hungarian armies. His
      father was a Walachian, his mother a Greek: her unknown race
      might possibly ascend to the emperors of Constantinople; and the
      claims of the Walachians, with the surname of Corvinus, from the
      place of his nativity, might suggest a thin pretence for mingling
      his blood with the patricians of ancient Rome. 31 In his youth he
      served in the wars of Italy, and was retained, with twelve
      horsemen, by the bishop of Zagrab: the valor of the _white
      knight_ 32 was soon conspicuous; he increased his fortunes by a
      noble and wealthy marriage; and in the defence of the Hungarian
      borders he won in the same year three battles against the Turks.
      By his influence, Ladislaus of Poland obtained the crown of
      Hungary; and the important service was rewarded by the title and
      office of Waivod of Transylvania. The first of Julian’s crusades
      added two Turkish laurels on his brow; and in the public distress
      the fatal errors of Warna were forgotten. During the absence and
      minority of Ladislaus of Austria, the titular king, Huniades was
      elected supreme captain and governor of Hungary; and if envy at
      first was silenced by terror, a reign of twelve years supposes
      the arts of policy as well as of war. Yet the idea of a
      consummate general is not delineated in his campaigns; the white
      knight fought with the hand rather than the head, as the chief of
      desultory Barbarians, who attack without fear and fly without
      shame; and his military life is composed of a romantic
      alternative of victories and escapes. By the Turks, who employed
      his name to frighten their perverse children, he was corruptly
      denominated _Jancus Lain_, or the Wicked: their hatred is the
      proof of their esteem; the kingdom which he guarded was
      inaccessible to their arms; and they felt him most daring and
      formidable, when they fondly believed the captain and his country
      irrecoverably lost. Instead of confining himself to a defensive
      war, four years after the defeat of Warna he again penetrated
      into the heart of Bulgaria, and in the plain of Cossova,
      sustained, till the third day, the shock of the Ottoman army,
      four times more numerous than his own. As he fled alone through
      the woods of Walachia, the hero was surprised by two robbers; but
      while they disputed a gold chain that hung at his neck, he
      recovered his sword, slew the one, terrified the other, and,
      after new perils of captivity or death, consoled by his presence
      an afflicted kingdom. But the last and most glorious action of
      his life was the defence of Belgrade against the powers of
      Mahomet the Second in person. After a siege of forty days, the
      Turks, who had already entered the town, were compelled to
      retreat; and the joyful nations celebrated Huniades and Belgrade
      as the bulwarks of Christendom. 33 About a month after this great
      deliverance, the champion expired; and his most splendid epitaph
      is the regret of the Ottoman prince, who sighed that he could no
      longer hope for revenge against the single antagonist who had
      triumphed over his arms. On the first vacancy of the throne,
      Matthias Corvinus, a youth of eighteen years of age, was elected
      and crowned by the grateful Hungarians. His reign was prosperous
      and long: Matthias aspired to the glory of a conqueror and a
      saint: but his purest merit is the encouragement of learning; and
      the Latin orators and historians, who were invited from Italy by
      the son, have shed the lustre of their eloquence on the father’s
      character. 34

      Epitome Rerum Hungaricarum (p. 322—412) of Peter Ranzanus, a
      Sicilian. His wise and facetious sayings are registered by
      Galestus Martius of Narni, (528—568,) and we have a particular
      narrative of his wedding and coronation. These three tracts are
      all contained in the first vol. of Bel’s Scriptores Rerum
      Hungaricarum.]

      In the list of heroes, John Huniades and Scanderbeg are commonly
      associated; 35 and they are both entitled to our notice, since
      their occupation of the Ottoman arms delayed the ruin of the
      Greek empire. John Castriot, the father of Scanderbeg, 36 was the
      hereditary prince of a small district of Epirus or Albania,
      between the mountains and the Adriatic Sea. Unable to contend
      with the sultan’s power, Castriot submitted to the hard
      conditions of peace and tribute: he delivered his four sons as
      the pledges of his fidelity; and the Christian youths, after
      receiving the mark of circumcision, were instructed in the
      Mahometan religion, and trained in the arms and arts of Turkish
      policy. 37 The three elder brothers were confounded in the crowd
      of slaves; and the poison to which their deaths are ascribed
      cannot be verified or disproved by any positive evidence. Yet the
      suspicion is in a great measure removed by the kind and paternal
      treatment of George Castriot, the fourth brother, who, from his
      tender youth, displayed the strength and spirit of a soldier. The
      successive overthrow of a Tartar and two Persians, who carried a
      proud defiance to the Turkish court, recommended him to the favor
      of Amurath, and his Turkish appellation of Scanderbeg, (_Iskender
      beg_,) or the lord Alexander, is an indelible memorial of his
      glory and servitude. His father’s principality was reduced into a
      province; but the loss was compensated by the rank and title of
      Sanjiak, a command of five thousand horse, and the prospect of
      the first dignities of the empire. He served with honor in the
      wars of Europe and Asia; and we may smile at the art or credulity
      of the historian, who supposes, that in every encounter he spared
      the Christians, while he fell with a thundering arm on his
      Mussulman foes. The glory of Huniades is without reproach: he
      fought in the defence of his religion and country; but the
      enemies who applaud the patriot, have branded his rival with the
      name of traitor and apostate. In the eyes of the Christian, the
      rebellion of Scanderbeg is justified by his father’s wrongs, the
      ambiguous death of his three brothers, his own degradation, and
      the slavery of his country; and they adore the generous, though
      tardy, zeal, with which he asserted the faith and independence of
      his ancestors. But he had imbibed from his ninth year the
      doctrines of the Koran; he was ignorant of the Gospel; the
      religion of a soldier is determined by authority and habit; nor
      is it easy to conceive what new illumination at the age of forty
      38 could be poured into his soul. His motives would be less
      exposed to the suspicion of interest or revenge, had he broken
      his chain from the moment that he was sensible of its weight: but
      a long oblivion had surely impaired his original right; and every
      year of obedience and reward had cemented the mutual bond of the
      sultan and his subject. If Scanderbeg had long harbored the
      belief of Christianity and the intention of revolt, a worthy mind
      must condemn the base dissimulation, that could serve only to
      betray, that could promise only to be forsworn, that could
      actively join in the temporal and spiritual perdition of so many
      thousands of his unhappy brethren. Shall we praise a secret
      correspondence with Huniades, while he commanded the vanguard of
      the Turkish army? shall we excuse the desertion of his standard,
      a treacherous desertion which abandoned the victory to the
      enemies of his benefactor? In the confusion of a defeat, the eye
      of Scanderbeg was fixed on the Reis Effendi or principal
      secretary: with the dagger at his breast, he extorted a firman or
      patent for the government of Albania; and the murder of the
      guiltless scribe and his train prevented the consequences of an
      immediate discovery. With some bold companions, to whom he had
      revealed his design he escaped in the night, by rapid marches,
      from the field or battle to his paternal mountains. The gates of
      Croya were opened to the royal mandate; and no sooner did he
      command the fortress, than George Castriot dropped the mask of
      dissimulation; abjured the prophet and the sultan, and proclaimed
      himself the avenger of his family and country. The names of
      religion and liberty provoked a general revolt: the Albanians, a
      martial race, were unanimous to live and die with their
      hereditary prince; and the Ottoman garrisons were indulged in the
      choice of martyrdom or baptism. In the assembly of the states of
      Epirus, Scanderbeg was elected general of the Turkish war; and
      each of the allies engaged to furnish his respective proportion
      of men and money. From these contributions, from his patrimonial
      estate, and from the valuable salt-pits of Selina, he drew an
      annual revenue of two hundred thousand ducats; 39 and the entire
      sum, exempt from the demands of luxury, was strictly appropriated
      to the public use. His manners were popular; but his discipline
      was severe; and every superfluous vice was banished from his
      camp: his example strengthened his command; and under his
      conduct, the Albanians were invincible in their own opinion and
      that of their enemies. The bravest adventurers of France and
      Germany were allured by his fame and retained in his service: his
      standing militia consisted of eight thousand horse and seven
      thousand foot; the horses were small, the men were active; but he
      viewed with a discerning eye the difficulties and resources of
      the mountains; and, at the blaze of the beacons, the whole nation
      was distributed in the strongest posts. With such unequal arms
      Scanderbeg resisted twenty-three years the powers of the Ottoman
      empire; and two conquerors, Amurath the Second, and his greater
      son, were repeatedly baffled by a rebel, whom they pursued with
      seeming contempt and implacable resentment. At the head of sixty
      thousand horse and forty thousand Janizaries, Amurath entered
      Albania: he might ravage the open country, occupy the defenceless
      towns, convert the churches into mosques, circumcise the
      Christian youths, and punish with death his adult and obstinate
      captives: but the conquests of the sultan were confined to the
      petty fortress of Sfetigrade; and the garrison, invincible to his
      arms, was oppressed by a paltry artifice and a superstitious
      scruple. 40 Amurath retired with shame and loss from the walls of
      Croya, the castle and residence of the Castriots; the march, the
      siege, the retreat, were harassed by a vexatious, and almost
      invisible, adversary; 41 and the disappointment might tend to
      imbitter, perhaps to shorten, the last days of the sultan. 42 In
      the fulness of conquest, Mahomet the Second still felt at his
      bosom this domestic thorn: his lieutenants were permitted to
      negotiate a truce; and the Albanian prince may justly be praised
      as a firm and able champion of his national independence. The
      enthusiasm of chivalry and religion has ranked him with the names
      of Alexander and Pyrrhus; nor would they blush to acknowledge
      their intrepid countryman: but his narrow dominion, and slender
      powers, must leave him at an humble distance below the heroes of
      antiquity, who triumphed over the East and the Roman legions. His
      splendid achievements, the bashaws whom he encountered, the
      armies that he discomfited, and the three thousand Turks who were
      slain by his single hand, must be weighed in the scales of
      suspicious criticism. Against an illiterate enemy, and in the
      dark solitude of Epirus, his partial biographers may safely
      indulge the latitude of romance: but their fictions are exposed
      by the light of Italian history; and they afford a strong
      presumption against their own truth, by a fabulous tale of his
      exploits, when he passed the Adriatic with eight hundred horse to
      the succor of the king of Naples. 43 Without disparagement to his
      fame, they might have owned, that he was finally oppressed by the
      Ottoman powers: in his extreme danger he applied to Pope Pius the
      Second for a refuge in the ecclesiastical state; and his
      resources were almost exhausted, since Scanderbeg died a fugitive
      at Lissus, on the Venetian territory. 44 His sepulchre was soon
      violated by the Turkish conquerors; but the Janizaries, who wore
      his bones enchased in a bracelet, declared by this superstitious
      amulet their involuntary reverence for his valor. The instant
      ruin of his country may redound to the hero’s glory; yet, had he
      balanced the consequences of submission and resistance, a patriot
      perhaps would have declined the unequal contest which must depend
      on the life and genius of one man. Scanderbeg might indeed be
      supported by the rational, though fallacious, hope, that the
      pope, the king of Naples, and the Venetian republic, would join
      in the defence of a free and Christian people, who guarded the
      sea-coast of the Adriatic, and the narrow passage from Greece to
      Italy. His infant son was saved from the national shipwreck; the
      Castriots 45 were invested with a Neapolitan dukedom, and their
      blood continues to flow in the noblest families of the realm. A
      colony of Albanian fugitives obtained a settlement in Calabria,
      and they preserve at this day the language and manners of their
      ancestors. 46

      In the long career of the decline and fall of the Roman empire, I
      have reached at length the last reign of the princes of
      Constantinople, who so feebly sustained the name and majesty of
      the Cæsars. On the decease of John Palæologus, who survived about
      four years the Hungarian crusade, 47 the royal family, by the
      death of Andronicus and the monastic profession of Isidore, was
      reduced to three princes, Constantine, Demetrius, and Thomas, the
      surviving sons of the emperor Manuel. Of these the first and the
      last were far distant in the Morea; but Demetrius, who possessed
      the domain of Selybria, was in the suburbs, at the head of a
      party: his ambition was not chilled by the public distress; and
      his conspiracy with the Turks and the schismatics had already
      disturbed the peace of his country. The funeral of the late
      emperor was accelerated with singular and even suspicious haste:
      the claim of Demetrius to the vacant throne was justified by a
      trite and flimsy sophism, that he was born in the purple, the
      eldest son of his father’s reign. But the empress-mother, the
      senate and soldiers, the clergy and people, were unanimous in the
      cause of the lawful successor: and the despot Thomas, who,
      ignorant of the change, accidentally returned to the capital,
      asserted with becoming zeal the interest of his absent brother.
      An ambassador, the historian Phranza, was immediately despatched
      to the court of Adrianople. Amurath received him with honor and
      dismissed him with gifts; but the gracious approbation of the
      Turkish sultan announced his supremacy, and the approaching
      downfall of the Eastern empire. By the hands of two illustrious
      deputies, the Imperial crown was placed at Sparta on the head of
      Constantine. In the spring he sailed from the Morea, escaped the
      encounter of a Turkish squadron, enjoyed the acclamations of his
      subjects, celebrated the festival of a new reign, and exhausted
      by his donatives the treasure, or rather the indigence, of the
      state. The emperor immediately resigned to his brothers the
      possession of the Morea; and the brittle friendship of the two
      princes, Demetrius and Thomas, was confirmed in their mother’s
      presence by the frail security of oaths and embraces. His next
      occupation was the choice of a consort. A daughter of the doge of
      Venice had been proposed; but the Byzantine nobles objected the
      distance between an hereditary monarch and an elective
      magistrate; and in their subsequent distress, the chief of that
      powerful republic was not unmindful of the affront. Constantine
      afterwards hesitated between the royal families of Trebizond and
      Georgia; and the embassy of Phranza represents in his public and
      private life the last days of the Byzantine empire. 48

      47 (return) [ The Chronology of Phranza is clear and authentic;
      but instead of four years and seven months, Spondanus (A.D. 1445,
      No. 7,) assigns seven or eight years to the reign of the last
      Constantine which he deduces from a spurious epistle of Eugenius
      IV. to the king of Æthiopia.]

      48 (return) [ Phranza (l. iii. c. 1—6) deserves credit and
      esteem.]

      The _protovestiare_, or great chamberlain, Phranza sailed from
      Constantinople as the minister of a bridegroom; and the relics of
      wealth and luxury were applied to his pompous appearance. His
      numerous retinue consisted of nobles and guards, of physicians
      and monks: he was attended by a band of music; and the term of
      his costly embassy was protracted above two years. On his arrival
      in Georgia or Iberia, the natives from the towns and villages
      flocked around the strangers; and such was their simplicity, that
      they were delighted with the effects, without understanding the
      cause, of musical harmony. Among the crowd was an old man, above
      a hundred years of age, who had formerly been carried away a
      captive by the Barbarians, 49 and who amused his hearers with a
      tale of the wonders of India, 50 from whence he had returned to
      Portugal by an unknown sea. 51 From this hospitable land, Phranza
      proceeded to the court of Trebizond, where he was informed by the
      Greek prince of the recent decease of Amurath. Instead of
      rejoicing in the deliverance, the experienced statesman expressed
      his apprehension, that an ambitious youth would not long adhere
      to the sage and pacific system of his father. After the sultan’s
      decease, his Christian wife, Maria, 52 the daughter of the
      Servian despot, had been honorably restored to her parents; on
      the fame of her beauty and merit, she was recommended by the
      ambassador as the most worthy object of the royal choice; and
      Phranza recapitulates and refutes the specious objections that
      might be raised against the proposal. The majesty of the purple
      would ennoble an unequal alliance; the bar of affinity might be
      removed by liberal alms and the dispensation of the church; the
      disgrace of Turkish nuptials had been repeatedly overlooked; and,
      though the fair Maria was nearly fifty years of age, she might
      yet hope to give an heir to the empire. Constantine listened to
      the advice, which was transmitted in the first ship that sailed
      from Trebizond; but the factions of the court opposed his
      marriage; and it was finally prevented by the pious vow of the
      sultana, who ended her days in the monastic profession. Reduced
      to the first alternative, the choice of Phranza was decided in
      favor of a Georgian princess; and the vanity of her father was
      dazzled by the glorious alliance. Instead of demanding, according
      to the primitive and national custom, a price for his daughter,
      53 he offered a portion of fifty-six thousand, with an annual
      pension of five thousand, ducats; and the services of the
      ambassador were repaid by an assurance, that, as his son had been
      adopted in baptism by the emperor, the establishment of his
      daughter should be the peculiar care of the empress of
      Constantinople. On the return of Phranza, the treaty was ratified
      by the Greek monarch, who with his own hand impressed three
      vermilion crosses on the golden bull, and assured the Georgian
      envoy that in the spring his galleys should conduct the bride to
      her Imperial palace. But Constantine embraced his faithful
      servant, not with the cold approbation of a sovereign, but with
      the warm confidence of a friend, who, after a long absence, is
      impatient to pour his secrets into the bosom of his friend.
      “Since the death of my mother and of Cantacuzene, who alone
      advised me without interest or passion, 54 I am surrounded,” said
      the emperor, “by men whom I can neither love nor trust, nor
      esteem. You are not a stranger to Lucas Notaras, the great
      admiral; obstinately attached to his own sentiments, he declares,
      both in private and public, that his sentiments are the absolute
      measure of my thoughts and actions. The rest of the courtiers are
      swayed by their personal or factious views; and how can I consult
      the monks on questions of policy and marriage? I have yet much
      employment for your diligence and fidelity. In the spring you
      shall engage one of my brothers to solicit the succor of the
      Western powers; from the Morea you shall sail to Cyprus on a
      particular commission; and from thence proceed to Georgia to
      receive and conduct the future empress.”—“Your commands,” replied
      Phranza, “are irresistible; but deign, great sir,” he added, with
      a serious smile, “to consider, that if I am thus perpetually
      absent from my family, my wife may be tempted either to seek
      another husband, or to throw herself into a monastery.” After
      laughing at his apprehensions, the emperor more gravely consoled
      him by the pleasing assurance that _this_ should be his last
      service abroad, and that he destined for his son a wealthy and
      noble heiress; for himself, the important office of great
      logothete, or principal minister of state. The marriage was
      immediately stipulated: but the office, however incompatible with
      his own, had been usurped by the ambition of the admiral. Some
      delay was requisite to negotiate a consent and an equivalent; and
      the nomination of Phranza was half declared, and half suppressed,
      lest it might be displeasing to an insolent and powerful
      favorite. The winter was spent in the preparations of his
      embassy; and Phranza had resolved, that the youth his son should
      embrace this opportunity of foreign travel, and be left, on the
      appearance of danger, with his maternal kindred of the Morea.
      Such were the private and public designs, which were interrupted
      by a Turkish war, and finally buried in the ruins of the empire.
