Chapter LXIV: Moguls, Ottoman Turks.—Part I.

     Conquests Of Zingis Khan And The Moguls From China To
     Poland.—Escape Of Constantinople And The Greeks.—Origin Of The
     Ottoman Turks In Bithynia.—Reigns And Victories Of Othman, Orchan,
     Amurath The First, And Bajazet The First.— Foundation And Progress
     Of The Turkish Monarchy In Asia And Europe.—Danger Of
     Constantinople And The Greek Empire.

      From the petty quarrels of a city and her suburbs, from the
      cowardice and discord of the falling Greeks, I shall now ascend
      to the victorious Turks; whose domestic slavery was ennobled by
      martial discipline, religious enthusiasm, and the energy of the
      national character. The rise and progress of the Ottomans, the
      present sovereigns of Constantinople, are connected with the most
      important scenes of modern history; but they are founded on a
      previous knowledge of the great eruption of the Moguls 100 and
      Tartars; whose rapid conquests may be compared with the primitive
      convulsions of nature, which have agitated and altered the
      surface of the globe. I have long since asserted my claim to
      introduce the nations, the immediate or remote authors of the
      fall of the Roman empire; nor can I refuse myself to those
      events, which, from their uncommon magnitude, will interest a
      philosophic mind in the history of blood. 1

      100 (return) [ Mongol seems to approach the nearest to the proper
      name of this race. The Chinese call them Mong-kou; the Mondchoux,
      their neighbors, Monggo or Monggou. They called themselves also
      Beda. This fact seems to have been proved by M. Schmidt against
      the French Orientalists. See De Brosset. Note on Le Beau, tom.
      xxii p. 402.]

      1 (return) [ The reader is invited to review chapters xxii. to
      xxvi., and xxiii. to xxxviii., the manners of pastoral nations,
      the conquests of Attila and the Huns, which were composed at a
      time when I entertained the wish, rather than the hope, of
      concluding my history.]

      From the spacious highlands between China, Siberia, and the
      Caspian Sea, the tide of emigration and war has repeatedly been
      poured. These ancient seats of the Huns and Turks were occupied
      in the twelfth century by many pastoral tribes, of the same
      descent and similar manners, which were united and led to
      conquest by the formidable Zingis. 101 In his ascent to
      greatness, that Barbarian (whose private appellation was Temugin)
      had trampled on the necks of his equals. His birth was noble; but
      it was the pride of victory, that the prince or people deduced
      his seventh ancestor from the immaculate conception of a virgin.
      His father had reigned over thirteen hordes, which composed about
      thirty or forty thousand families: above two thirds refused to
      pay tithes or obedience to his infant son; and at the age of
      thirteen, Temugin fought a battle against his rebellious
      subjects. The future conqueror of Asia was reduced to fly and to
      obey; but he rose superior to his fortune, and in his fortieth
      year he had established his fame and dominion over the
      circumjacent tribes. In a state of society, in which policy is
      rude and valor is universal, the ascendant of one man must be
      founded on his power and resolution to punish his enemies and
      recompense his friends. His first military league was ratified by
      the simple rites of sacrificing a horse and tasting of a running
      stream: Temugin pledged himself to divide with his followers the
      sweets and the bitters of life; and when he had shared among them
      his horses and apparel, he was rich in their gratitude and his
      own hopes. After his first victory, he placed seventy caldrons on
      the fire, and seventy of the most guilty rebels were cast
      headlong into the boiling water. The sphere of his attraction was
      continually enlarged by the ruin of the proud and the submission
      of the prudent; and the boldest chieftains might tremble, when
      they beheld, enchased in silver, the skull of the khan of
      Keraites; 2 who, under the name of Prester John, had corresponded
      with the Roman pontiff and the princes of Europe. The ambition of
      Temugin condescended to employ the arts of superstition; and it
      was from a naked prophet, who could ascend to heaven on a white
      horse, that he accepted the title of Zingis, 3 the _most great_;
      and a divine right to the conquest and dominion of the earth. In
      a general _couroultai_, or diet, he was seated on a felt, which
      was long afterwards revered as a relic, and solemnly proclaimed
      great khan, or emperor of the Moguls 4 and Tartars. 5 Of these
      kindred, though rival, names, the former had given birth to the
      imperial race; and the latter has been extended by accident or
      error over the spacious wilderness of the north.

      101 (return) [ On the traditions of the early life of Zingis, see
      D’Ohson, Hist des Mongols; Histoire des Mongols, Paris, 1824.
      Schmidt, Geschichte des Ost-Mongolen, p. 66, &c., and Notes.—M.]

      2 (return) [ The khans of the Keraites were most probably
      incapable of reading the pompous epistles composed in their name
      by the Nestorian missionaries, who endowed them with the fabulous
      wonders of an Indian kingdom. Perhaps these Tartars (the
      Presbyter or Priest John) had submitted to the rites of baptism
      and ordination, (Asseman, Bibliot Orient tom. iii. p. ii. p.
      487—503.)]

      3 (return) [ Since the history and tragedy of Voltaire, Gengis,
      at least in French, seems to be the more fashionable spelling;
      but Abulghazi Khan must have known the true name of his ancestor.
      His etymology appears just: _Zin_, in the Mogul tongue, signifies
      _great_, and _gis_ is the superlative termination, (Hist.
      Généalogique des Tatars, part iii. p. 194, 195.) From the same
      idea of magnitude, the appellation of _Zingis_ is bestowed on the
      ocean.]

      4 (return) [ The name of Moguls has prevailed among the
      Orientals, and still adheres to the titular sovereign, the Great
      Mogul of Hindastan. * Note: M. Remusat (sur les Langues Tartares,
      p. 233) justly observes, that Timour was a Turk, not a Mogul,
      and, p. 242, that probably there was not Mogul in the army of
      Baber, who established the Indian throne of the “Great
      Mogul.”—M.]

      5 (return) [ The Tartars (more properly Tatars) were descended
      from Tatar Khan, the brother of Mogul Khan, (see Abulghazi, part
      i. and ii.,) and once formed a horde of 70,000 families on the
      borders of Kitay, (p. 103—112.) In the great invasion of Europe
      (A.D. 1238) they seem to have led the vanguard; and the
      similitude of the name of _Tartarei_, recommended that of Tartars
      to the Latins, (Matt. Paris, p. 398, &c.) * Note: This
      relationship, according to M. Klaproth, is fabulous, and invented
      by the Mahometan writers, who, from religious zeal, endeavored to
      connect the traditions of the nomads of Central Asia with those
      of the Old Testament, as preserved in the Koran. There is no
      trace of it in the Chinese writers. Tabl. de l’Asie, p. 156.—M.]

      The code of laws which Zingis dictated to his subjects was
      adapted to the preservation of a domestic peace, and the exercise
      of foreign hostility. The punishment of death was inflicted on
      the crimes of adultery, murder, perjury, and the capital thefts
      of a horse or ox; and the fiercest of men were mild and just in
      their intercourse with each other. The future election of the
      great khan was vested in the princes of his family and the heads
      of the tribes; and the regulations of the chase were essential to
      the pleasures and plenty of a Tartar camp. The victorious nation
      was held sacred from all servile labors, which were abandoned to
      slaves and strangers; and every labor was servile except the
      profession of arms. The service and discipline of the troops, who
      were armed with bows, cimeters, and iron maces, and divided by
      hundreds, thousands, and ten thousands, were the institutions of
      a veteran commander. Each officer and soldier was made
      responsible, under pain of death, for the safety and honor of his
      companions; and the spirit of conquest breathed in the law, that
      peace should never be granted unless to a vanquished and
      suppliant enemy. But it is the religion of Zingis that best
      deserves our wonder and applause. 501 The Catholic inquisitors of
      Europe, who defended nonsense by cruelty, might have been
      confounded by the example of a Barbarian, who anticipated the
      lessons of philosophy, 6 and established by his laws a system of
      pure theism and perfect toleration. His first and only article of
      faith was the existence of one God, the Author of all good; who
      fills by his presence the heavens and earth, which he has created
      by his power. The Tartars and Moguls were addicted to the idols
      of their peculiar tribes; and many of them had been converted by
      the foreign missionaries to the religions of Moses, of Mahomet,
      and of Christ. These various systems in freedom and concord were
      taught and practised within the precincts of the same camp; and
      the Bonze, the Imam, the Rabbi, the Nestorian, and the Latin
      priest, enjoyed the same honorable exemption from service and
      tribute: in the mosque of Bochara, the insolent victor might
      trample the Koran under his horse’s feet, but the calm legislator
      respected the prophets and pontiffs of the most hostile sects.
      The reason of Zingis was not informed by books: the khan could
      neither read nor write; and, except the tribe of the Igours, the
      greatest part of the Moguls and Tartars were as illiterate as
      their sovereign. 601 The memory of their exploits was preserved
      by tradition: sixty-eight years after the death of Zingis, these
      traditions were collected and transcribed; 7 the brevity of their
      domestic annals may be supplied by the Chinese, 8 Persians, 9
      Armenians, 10 Syrians, 11 Arabians, 12 Greeks, 13 Russians, 14
      Poles, 15 Hungarians, 16 and Latins; 17 and each nation will
      deserve credit in the relation of their own disasters and
      defeats. 18

      501 (return) [ Before his armies entered Thibet, he sent an
      embassy to Bogdosottnam-Dsimmo, a Lama high priest, with a letter
      to this effect: “I have chosen thee as high priest for myself and
      my empire. Repair then to me, and promote the present and future
      happiness of man: I will be thy supporter and protector: let us
      establish a system of religion, and unite it with the monarchy,”
      &c. The high priest accepted the invitation; and the Mongol
      history literally terms this step the _period of the first
      respect for religion_; because the monarch, by his public
      profession, made it the religion of the state. Klaproth. “Travels
      in Caucasus,” ch. 7, Eng. Trans. p. 92. Neither Dshingis nor his
      son and successor Oegodah had, on account of their continual
      wars, much leisure for the propagation of the religion of the
      Lama. By religion they understand a distinct, independent, sacred
      moral code, which has but one origin, one source, and one object.
      This notion they universally propagate, and even believe that the
      brutes, and all created beings, have a religion adapted to their
      sphere of action. The different forms of the various religions
      they ascribe to the difference of individuals, nations, and
      legislators. Never do you hear of their inveighing against any
      creed, even against the obviously absurd Schaman paganism, or of
      their persecuting others on that account. They themselves, on the
      other hand, endure every hardship, and even persecutions, with
      perfect resignation, and indulgently excuse the follies of
      others, nay, consider them as a motive for increased ardor in
      prayer, ch. ix. p. 109.—M.]

      6 (return) [ A singular conformity may be found between the
      religious laws of Zingis Khan and of Mr. Locke, (Constitutions of
      Carolina, in his works, vol. iv. p. 535, 4to. edition, 1777.)]

      601 (return) [ See the notice on Tha-tha-toung-o, the Ouogour
      minister of Tchingis, in Abel Remusat’s 2d series of Recherch.
      Asiat. vol. ii. p. 61. He taught the son of Tchingis to write:
      “He was the instructor of the Moguls in writing, of which they
      were before ignorant;” and hence the application of the Ouigour
      characters to the Mogul language cannot be placed earlier than
      the year 1204 or 1205, nor so late as the time of Pà-sse-pa, who
      lived under Khubilai. A new alphabet, approaching to that of
      Thibet, was introduced under Khubilai.—M.]

      7 (return) [ In the year 1294, by the command of Cazan, khan of

      his vizier Fadlallah composed a Mogul history in the Persian
      language, which has been used by Petit de la Croix, (Hist. de
      Genghizcan, p. 537—539.) The Histoire Généalogique des Tatars (à
      Leyde, 1726, in 12mo., 2 tomes) was translated by the Swedish
      prisoners in Siberia from the Mogul MS. of Abulgasi Bahadur Khan,
      a descendant of Zingis, who reigned over the Usbeks of Charasm,
      or Carizme, (A.D. 1644—1663.) He is of most value and credit for
      the names, pedigrees, and manners of his nation. Of his nine
      parts, the ist descends from Adam to Mogul Khan; the iid, from
      Mogul to Zingis; the iiid is the life of Zingis; the ivth, vth,
      vith, and viith, the general history of his four sons and their
      posterity; the viiith and ixth, the particular history of the
      descendants of Sheibani Khan, who reigned in Maurenahar and

      from the Persian writers, among whom Nisavi, the secretary of
      Sultan Gelaleddin, has the merit and prejudices of a
      contemporary. A slight air of romance is the fault of the
      originals, or the compiler. See likewise the articles of

      necessity of connecting the Scythian and Byzantine histories. He
      describes with truth and elegance the settlement and manners of
      the Moguls of Persia, but he is ignorant of their origin, and
      corrupts the names of Zingis and his sons.]

      Barbaric invasion.]

      17 (return) [ Matthew Paris has represented, from authentic
      documents, the danger and distress of Europe, (consult the word
      _Tartari_ in his copious Index.) From motives of zeal and
      curiosity, the court of the great khan in the xiiith century was
      visited by two friars, John de Plano Carpini, and William
      Rubruquis, and by Marco Polo, a Venetian gentleman. The Latin
      relations of the two former are inserted in the 1st volume of
      Hackluyt; the Italian original or version of the third (Fabric.
      Bibliot. Latin. Medii Ævi, tom. ii. p. 198, tom. v. p. 25) may be
      found in the second tome of Ramusio.]

      most amply treated of Zingis Khan and his successors. See tom.
      iii. l. xv.—xix., and in the collateral articles of the
      Seljukians of Roum, tom. ii. l. xi., the Carizmians, l. xiv., and
      the Mamalukes, tom. iv. l. xxi.; consult likewise the tables of
      the 1st volume. He is ever learned and accurate; yet I am only
      indebted to him for a general view, and some passages of
      Abulfeda, which are still latent in the Arabic text. * Note: To
      this catalogue of the historians of the Moguls may be added

      and Persian authorities,) Paris, 1824. Schmidt, Geschichte der
      Ost Mongolen, St. Petersburgh, 1829. This curious work, by
      Ssanang Ssetsen Chungtaidschi, published in the original Mongol,
      was written after the conversion of the nation to Buddhism: it is
      enriched with very valuable notes by the editor and translator;
      but, unfortunately, is very barren of information about the
      European and even the western Asiatic conquests of the
      Mongols.—M.]




      Chapter LXIV: Moguls, Ottoman Turks.—Part II.

      The arms of Zingis and his lieutenants successively reduced the
      hordes of the desert, who pitched their tents between the wall of
      China and the Volga; and the Mogul emperor became the monarch of
      the pastoral world, the lord of many millions of shepherds and
      soldiers, who felt their united strength, and were impatient to
      rush on the mild and wealthy climates of the south. His ancestors
      had been the tributaries of the Chinese emperors; and Temugin
      himself had been disgraced by a title of honor and servitude. The
      court of Pekin was astonished by an embassy from its former
      vassal, who, in the tone of the king of nations, exacted the
      tribute and obedience which he had paid, and who affected to
      treat the _son of heaven_ as the most contemptible of mankind. A
      haughty answer disguised their secret apprehensions; and their
      fears were soon justified by the march of innumerable squadrons,
      who pierced on all sides the feeble rampart of the great wall.
      Ninety cities were stormed, or starved, by the Moguls; ten only
      escaped; and Zingis, from a knowledge of the filial piety of the
      Chinese, covered his vanguard with their captive parents; an
      unworthy, and by degrees a fruitless, abuse of the virtue of his
      enemies. His invasion was supported by the revolt of a hundred
      thousand Khitans, who guarded the frontier: yet he listened to a
      treaty; and a princess of China, three thousand horses, five
      hundred youths, and as many virgins, and a tribute of gold and
      silk, were the price of his retreat. In his second expedition, he
      compelled the Chinese emperor to retire beyond the yellow river
      to a more southern residence. The siege of Pekin 19 was long and
      laborious: the inhabitants were reduced by famine to decimate and
      devour their fellow-citizens; when their ammunition was spent,
      they discharged ingots of gold and silver from their engines; but
      the Moguls introduced a mine to the centre of the capital; and
      the conflagration of the palace burnt above thirty days. China
      was desolated by Tartar war and domestic faction; and the five
      northern provinces were added to the empire of Zingis.

      19 (return) [ More properly _Yen-king_, an ancient city, whose
      ruins still appear some furlongs to the south-east of the modern
      _Pekin_, which was built by Cublai Khan, (Gaubel, p. 146.)
      Pe-king and Nan-king are vague titles, the courts of the north
      and of the south. The identity and change of names perplex the
      most skilful readers of the Chinese geography, (p. 177.) * Note:
      And likewise in Chinese history—see Abel Remusat, Mel. Asiat. 2d
      tom. ii. p. 5.—M.]

      In the West, he touched the dominions of Mohammed, sultan of
      Carizme, who reigned from the Persian Gulf to the borders of
      India and Turkestan; and who, in the proud imitation of Alexander
      the Great, forgot the servitude and ingratitude of his fathers to
      the house of Seljuk. It was the wish of Zingis to establish a
      friendly and commercial intercourse with the most powerful of the
      Moslem princes: nor could he be tempted by the secret
      solicitations of the caliph of Bagdad, who sacrificed to his
      personal wrongs the safety of the church and state. A rash and
      inhuman deed provoked and justified the Tartar arms in the
      invasion of the southern Asia. 191 A caravan of three ambassadors
      and one hundred and fifty merchants were arrested and murdered at
      Otrar, by the command of Mohammed; nor was it till after a demand
      and denial of justice, till he had prayed and fasted three nights
      on a mountain, that the Mogul emperor appealed to the judgment of
      God and his sword. Our European battles, says a philosophic
      writer, 20 are petty skirmishes, if compared to the numbers that
      have fought and fallen in the fields of Asia. Seven hundred
      thousand Moguls and Tartars are said to have marched under the
      standard of Zingis and his four sons. In the vast plains that
      extend to the north of the Sihon or Jaxartes, they were
      encountered by four hundred thousand soldiers of the sultan; and
      in the first battle, which was suspended by the night, one
      hundred and sixty thousand Carizmians were slain. Mohammed was
      astonished by the multitude and valor of his enemies: he withdrew
      from the scene of danger, and distributed his troops in the
      frontier towns; trusting that the Barbarians, invincible in the
      field, would be repulsed by the length and difficulty of so many
      regular sieges. But the prudence of Zingis had formed a body of
      Chinese engineers, skilled in the mechanic arts; informed perhaps
      of the secret of gunpowder, and capable, under his discipline, of
      attacking a foreign country with more vigor and success than they
      had defended their own. The Persian historians will relate the
      sieges and reduction of Otrar, Cogende, Bochara, Samarcand,
      Carizme, Herat, Merou, Nisabour, Balch, and Candahar; and the
      conquest of the rich and populous countries of Transoxiana,
      Carizme, and Chorazan. 204 The destructive hostilities of Attila
      and the Huns have long since been elucidated by the example of
      Zingis and the Moguls; and in this more proper place I shall be
      content to observe, that, from the Caspian to the Indus, they
      ruined a tract of many hundred miles, which was adorned with the
      habitations and labors of mankind, and that five centuries have
      not been sufficient to repair the ravages of four years. The
      Mogul emperor encouraged or indulged the fury of his troops: the
      hope of future possession was lost in the ardor of rapine and
      slaughter; and the cause of the war exasperated their native
      fierceness by the pretence of justice and revenge. The downfall
      and death of the sultan Mohammed, who expired, unpitied and
      alone, in a desert island of the Caspian Sea, is a poor atonement
      for the calamities of which he was the author. Could the
      Carizmian empire have been saved by a single hero, it would have
      been saved by his son Gelaleddin, whose active valor repeatedly
      checked the Moguls in the career of victory. Retreating, as he
      fought, to the banks of the Indus, he was oppressed by their
      innumerable host, till, in the last moment of despair, Gelaleddin
      spurred his horse into the waves, swam one of the broadest and
      most rapid rivers of Asia, and extorted the admiration and
      applause of Zingis himself. It was in this camp that the Mogul
      conqueror yielded with reluctance to the murmurs of his weary and
      wealthy troops, who sighed for the enjoyment of their native
      land. Eucumbered with the spoils of Asia, he slowly measured back
      his footsteps, betrayed some pity for the misery of the
      vanquished, and declared his intention of rebuilding the cities
      which had been swept away by the tempest of his arms. After he
      had repassed the Oxus and Jaxartes, he was joined by two
      generals, whom he had detached with thirty thousand horse, to
      subdue the western provinces of Persia. They had trampled on the
      nations which opposed their passage, penetrated through the gates
      of Derbent, traversed the Volga and the desert, and accomplished
      the circuit of the Caspian Sea, by an expedition which had never
      been attempted, and has never been repeated. The return of Zingis
      was signalized by the overthrow of the rebellious or independent
      kingdoms of Tartary; and he died in the fulness of years and
      glory, with his last breath exhorting and instructing his sons to
      achieve the conquest of the Chinese empire. 205

      The harem of Zingis was composed of five hundred wives and
      concubines; and of his numerous progeny, four sons, illustrious
      by their birth and merit, exercised under their father the
      principal offices of peace and war. Toushi was his great
      huntsman, Zagatai 21 his judge, Octai his minister, and Tuli his
      general; and their names and actions are often conspicuous in the
      history of his conquests. Firmly united for their own and the
      public interest, the three brothers and their families were
      content with dependent sceptres; and Octai, by general consent,
      was proclaimed great khan, or emperor of the Moguls and Tartars.
      He was succeeded by his son Gayuk, after whose death the empire
      devolved to his cousins Mangou and Cublai, the sons of Tuli, and
      the grandsons of Zingis. In the sixty-eight years of his four
      first successors, the Mogul subdued almost all Asia, and a large
      portion of Europe. Without confining myself to the order of time,
      without expatiating on the detail of events, I shall present a
      general picture of the progress of their arms; I. In the East;
      II. In the South; III. In the West; and IV. In the North.

      I. Before the invasion of Zingis, China was divided into two
      empires or dynasties of the North and South; 22 and the
      difference of origin and interest was smoothed by a general
      conformity of laws, language, and national manners. The Northern
      empire, which had been dismembered by Zingis, was finally subdued
      seven years after his death. After the loss of Pekin, the emperor
      had fixed his residence at Kaifong, a city many leagues in
      circumference, and which contained, according to the Chinese
      annals, fourteen hundred thousand families of inhabitants and
      fugitives. He escaped from thence with only seven horsemen, and
      made his last stand in a third capital, till at length the
      hopeless monarch, protesting his innocence and accusing his
      fortune, ascended a funeral pile, and gave orders, that, as soon
      as he had stabbed himself, the fire should be kindled by his
      attendants. The dynasty of the _Song_, the native and ancient
      sovereigns of the whole empire, survived about forty-five years
      the fall of the Northern usurpers; and the perfect conquest was
      reserved for the arms of Cublai. During this interval, the Moguls
      were often diverted by foreign wars; and, if the Chinese seldom
      dared to meet their victors in the field, their passive courage
      presented and endless succession of cities to storm and of
      millions to slaughter. In the attack and defence of places, the
      engines of antiquity and the Greek fire were alternately
      employed: the use of gunpowder in cannon and bombs appears as a
      familiar practice; 23 and the sieges were conducted by the
      Mahometans and Franks, who had been liberally invited into the
      service of Cublai. After passing the great river, the troops and
      artillery were conveyed along a series of canals, till they
      invested the royal residence of Hamcheu, or Quinsay, in the
      country of silk, the most delicious climate of China. The
      emperor, a defenceless youth, surrendered his person and sceptre;
      and before he was sent in exile into Tartary, he struck nine
      times the ground with his forehead, to adore in prayer or
      thanksgiving the mercy of the great khan. Yet the war (it was now
      styled a rebellion) was still maintained in the southern
      provinces from Hamcheu to Canton; and the obstinate remnant of
      independence and hostility was transported from the land to the
      sea. But when the fleet of the _Song_ was surrounded and
      oppressed by a superior armament, their last champion leaped into
      the waves with his infant emperor in his arms. “It is more
      glorious,” he cried, “to die a prince, than to live a slave.” A
      hundred thousand Chinese imitated his example; and the whole
      empire, from Tonkin to the great wall, submitted to the dominion
      of Cublai. His boundless ambition aspired to the conquest of
      Japan: his fleet was twice shipwrecked; and the lives of a
      hundred thousand Moguls and Chinese were sacrificed in the
      fruitless expedition. But the circumjacent kingdoms, Corea,
      Tonkin, Cochinchina, Pegu, Bengal, and Thibet, were reduced in
      different degrees of tribute and obedience by the effort or
      terror of his arms. He explored the Indian Ocean with a fleet of
      a thousand ships: they sailed in sixty-eight days, most probably
      to the Isle of Borneo, under the equinoctial line; and though
      they returned not without spoil or glory, the emperor was
      dissatisfied that the savage king had escaped from their hands.

      of the Portuguese and Jesuits in the xvith. Yet the Père Gaubil

      II. The conquest of Hindostan by the Moguls was reserved in a
      later period for the house of Timour; but that of Iran, or
      Persia, was achieved by Holagou Khan, 231 the grandson of Zingis,
      the brother and lieutenant of the two successive emperors, Mangou
      and Cublai. I shall not enumerate the crowd of sultans, emirs,
      and atabeks, whom he trampled into dust; but the extirpation of
      the _Assassins_, or Ismaelians 24 of Persia, may be considered as
      a service to mankind. Among the hills to the south of the
      Caspian, these odious sectaries had reigned with impunity above a
      hundred and sixty years; and their prince, or Imam, established
      his lieutenant to lead and govern the colony of Mount Libanus, so
      famous and formidable in the history of the crusades. 25 With the
      fanaticism of the Koran the Ismaelians had blended the Indian
      transmigration, and the visions of their own prophets; and it was
      their first duty to devote their souls and bodies in blind
      obedience to the vicar of God. The daggers of his missionaries
      were felt both in the East and West: the Christians and the
      Moslems enumerate, and persons multiply, the illustrious victims
      that were sacrificed to the zeal, avarice, or resentment of _the
      old man_ (as he was corruptly styled) _of the mountain_. But
      these daggers, his only arms, were broken by the sword of
      Holagou, and not a vestige is left of the enemies of mankind,
      except the word _assassin_, which, in the most odious sense, has
      been adopted in the languages of Europe. The extinction of the
      Abbassides cannot be indifferent to the spectators of their
      greatness and decline. Since the fall of their Seljukian tyrants
      the caliphs had recovered their lawful dominion of Bagdad and the
      Arabian Irak; but the city was distracted by theological
      factions, and the commander of the faithful was lost in a harem
      of seven hundred concubines. The invasion of the Moguls he
      encountered with feeble arms and haughty embassies. “On the
      divine decree,” said the caliph Mostasem, “is founded the throne
      of the sons of Abbas: and their foes shall surely be destroyed in
      this world and in the next. Who is this Holagou that dares to
      rise against them? If he be desirous of peace, let him instantly
      depart from the sacred territory; and perhaps he may obtain from
      our clemency the pardon of his fault.” This presumption was
      cherished by a perfidious vizier, who assured his master, that,
      even if the Barbarians had entered the city, the women and
      children, from the terraces, would be sufficient to overwhelm
      them with stones. But when Holagou touched the phantom, it
      instantly vanished into smoke. After a siege of two months,
      Bagdad was stormed and sacked by the Moguls; 251 and their savage
      commander pronounced the death of the caliph Mostasem, the last
      of the temporal successors of Mahomet; whose noble kinsmen, of
      the race of Abbas, had reigned in Asia above five hundred years.
      Whatever might be the designs of the conqueror, the holy cities
      of Mecca and Medina 26 were protected by the Arabian desert; but
      the Moguls spread beyond the Tigris and Euphrates, pillaged
      Aleppo and Damascus, and threatened to join the Franks in the
      deliverance of Jerusalem. Egypt was lost, had she been defended
      only by her feeble offspring; but the Mamalukes had breathed in
      their infancy the keenness of a Scythian air: equal in valor,
      superior in discipline, they met the Moguls in many a well-fought
      field; and drove back the stream of hostility to the eastward of
      the Euphrates. 261 But it overflowed with resistless violence the
      kingdoms of Armenia 262 and Anatolia, of which the former was
      possessed by the Christians, and the latter by the Turks. The
      sultans of Iconium opposed some resistance to the Mogul arms,
      till Azzadin sought a refuge among the Greeks of Constantinople,
      and his feeble successors, the last of the Seljukian dynasty,
      were finally extirpated by the khans of Persia. 263

      III. No sooner had Octai subverted the northern empire of China,
      than he resolved to visit with his arms the most remote countries
      of the West. Fifteen hundred thousand Moguls and Tartars were
      inscribed on the military roll: of these the great khan selected
      a third, which he intrusted to the command of his nephew Batou,
      the son of Tuli; who reigned over his father’s conquests to the
      north of the Caspian Sea. 264 After a festival of forty days,
      Batou set forwards on this great expedition; and such was the
      speed and ardor of his innumerable squadrons, than in less than
      six years they had measured a line of ninety degrees of
      longitude, a fourth part of the circumference of the globe. The
      great rivers of Asia and Europe, the Volga and Kama, the Don and
      Borysthenes, the Vistula and Danube, they either swam with their
      horses or passed on the ice, or traversed in leathern boats,
      which followed the camp, and transported their wagons and
      artillery. By the first victories of Batou, the remains of
      national freedom were eradicated in the immense plains of
      Turkestan and Kipzak. 27 In his rapid progress, he overran the
      kingdoms, as they are now styled, of Astracan and Cazan; and the
      troops which he detached towards Mount Caucasus explored the most
      secret recesses of Georgia and Circassia. The civil discord of
      the great dukes, or princes, of Russia, betrayed their country to
      the Tartars. They spread from Livonia to the Black Sea, and both
      Moscow and Kiow, the modern and the ancient capitals, were
      reduced to ashes; a temporary ruin, less fatal than the deep, and
      perhaps indelible, mark, which a servitude of two hundred years
      has imprinted on the character of the Russians. The Tartars
      ravaged with equal fury the countries which they hoped to
      possess, and those which they were hastening to leave. From the
      permanent conquest of Russia they made a deadly, though
      transient, inroad into the heart of Poland, and as far as the
      borders of Germany. The cities of Lublin and Cracow were
      obliterated: 271 they approached the shores of the Baltic; and in
      the battle of Lignitz they defeated the dukes of Silesia, the
      Polish palatines, and the great master of the Teutonic order, and
      filled nine sacks with the right ears of the slain. From Lignitz,
      the extreme point of their western march, they turned aside to
      the invasion of Hungary; and the presence or spirit of Batou
      inspired the host of five hundred thousand men: the Carpathian
      hills could not be long impervious to their divided columns; and
      their approach had been fondly disbelieved till it was
      irresistibly felt. The king, Bela the Fourth, assembled the
      military force of his counts and bishops; but he had alienated
      the nation by adopting a vagrant horde of forty thousand families
      of Comans, and these savage guests were provoked to revolt by the
      suspicion of treachery and the murder of their prince. The whole
      country north of the Danube was lost in a day, and depopulated in
      a summer; and the ruins of cities and churches were overspread
      with the bones of the natives, who expiated the sins of their
      Turkish ancestors. An ecclesiastic, who fled from the sack of
      Waradin, describes the calamities which he had seen, or suffered;
      and the sanguinary rage of sieges and battles is far less
      atrocious than the treatment of the fugitives, who had been
      allured from the woods under a promise of peace and pardon and
      who were coolly slaughtered as soon as they had performed the
      labors of the harvest and vintage. In the winter the Tartars
      passed the Danube on the ice, and advanced to Gran or Strigonium,
      a German colony, and the metropolis of the kingdom. Thirty
      engines were planted against the walls; the ditches were filled
      with sacks of earth and dead bodies; and after a promiscuous
      massacre, three hundred noble matrons were slain in the presence
      of the khan. Of all the cities and fortresses of Hungary, three
      alone survived the Tartar invasion, and the unfortunate Bata hid
      his head among the islands of the Adriatic.

      The Latin world was darkened by this cloud of savage hostility: a
      Russian fugitive carried the alarm to Sweden; and the remote
      nations of the Baltic and the ocean trembled at the approach of
      the Tartars, 28 whom their fear and ignorance were inclined to
      separate from the human species. Since the invasion of the Arabs
      in the eighth century, Europe had never been exposed to a similar
      calamity: and if the disciples of Mahomet would have oppressed
      her religion and liberty, it might be apprehended that the
      shepherds of Scythia would extinguish her cities, her arts, and
      all the institutions of civil society. The Roman pontiff
      attempted to appease and convert these invincible Pagans by a
      mission of Franciscan and Dominican friars; but he was astonished
      by the reply of the khan, that the sons of God and of Zingis were
      invested with a divine power to subdue or extirpate the nations;
      and that the pope would be involved in the universal destruction,
      unless he visited in person, and as a suppliant, the royal horde.
      The emperor Frederic the Second embraced a more generous mode of
      defence; and his letters to the kings of France and England, and
      the princes of Germany, represented the common danger, and urged
      them to arm their vassals in this just and rational crusade. 29
      The Tartars themselves were awed by the fame and valor of the
      Franks; the town of Newstadt in Austria was bravely defended
      against them by fifty knights and twenty crossbows; and they
      raised the siege on the appearance of a German army. After
      wasting the adjacent kingdoms of Servia, Bosnia, and Bulgaria,
      Batou slowly retreated from the Danube to the Volga to enjoyed
      the rewards of victory in the city and palace of Serai, which
      started at his command from the midst of the desert. 291

      forty or fifty of these fish were sold for a shilling, (Matthew
      Paris, p. 396.) It is whimsical enough, that the orders of a
      Mogul khan, who reigned on the borders of China, should have
      lowered the price of herrings in the English market.]

      IV. Even the poor and frozen regions of the north attracted the
      arms of the Moguls: Sheibani khan, the brother of the great
      Batou, led a horde of fifteen thousand families into the wilds of
      Siberia; and his descendants reigned at Tobolskoi above three
      centuries, till the Russian conquest. The spirit of enterprise
      which pursued the course of the Oby and Yenisei must have led to
      the discovery of the icy sea. After brushing away the monstrous
      fables, of men with dogs’ heads and cloven feet, we shall find,
      that, fifteen years after the death of Zingis, the Moguls were
      informed of the name and manners of the Samoyedes in the
      neighborhood of the polar circle, who dwelt in subterraneous
      huts, and derived their furs and their food from the sole

      While China, Syria, and Poland, were invaded at the same time by
      the Moguls and Tartars, the authors of the mighty mischief were
      content with the knowledge and declaration, that their word was
      the sword of death. Like the first caliphs, the first successors
      of Zingis seldom appeared in person at the head of their
      victorious armies. On the banks of the Onon and Selinga, the
      royal or _golden horde_ exhibited the contrast of simplicity and
      greatness; of the roasted sheep and mare’s milk which composed
      their banquets; and of a distribution in one day of five hundred
      wagons of gold and silver. The ambassadors and princes of Europe
      and Asia were compelled to undertake this distant and laborious
      pilgrimage; and the life and reign of the great dukes of Russia,
      the kings of Georgia and Armenia, the sultans of Iconium, and the
      emirs of Persia, were decided by the frown or smile of the great
      khan. The sons and grandsons of Zingis had been accustomed to the
      pastoral life; but the village of Caracorum 31 was gradually
      ennobled by their election and residence. A change of manners is
      implied in the removal of Octai and Mangou from a tent to a
      house; and their example was imitated by the princes of their
      family and the great officers of the empire. Instead of the
      boundless forest, the enclosure of a park afforded the more
      indolent pleasures of the chase; their new habitations were
      decorated with painting and sculpture; their superfluous
      treasures were cast in fountains, and basins, and statues of
      massy silver; and the artists of China and Paris vied with each
      other in the service of the great khan. 32 Caracorum contained
      two streets, the one of Chinese mechanics, the other of Mahometan
      traders; and the places of religious worship, one Nestorian
      church, two mosques, and twelve temples of various idols, may
      represent in some degree the number and division of inhabitants.
      Yet a French missionary declares, that the town of St. Denys,
      near Paris, was more considerable than the Tartar capital; and
      that the whole palace of Mangou was scarcely equal to a tenth
      part of that Benedictine abbey. The conquests of Russia and Syria
      might amuse the vanity of the great khans; but they were seated
      on the borders of China; the acquisition of that empire was the
      nearest and most interesting object; and they might learn from
      their pastoral economy, that it is for the advantage of the
      shepherd to protect and propagate his flock. I have already
      celebrated the wisdom and virtue of a Mandarin who prevented the
      desolation of five populous and cultivated provinces. In a
      spotless administration of thirty years, this friend of his
      country and of mankind continually labored to mitigate, or
      suspend, the havoc of war; to save the monuments, and to rekindle
      the flame, of science; to restrain the military commander by the
      restoration of civil magistrates; and to instil the love of peace
      and justice into the minds of the Moguls. He struggled with the
      barbarism of the first conquerors; but his salutary lessons
      produced a rich harvest in the second generation. 321 The
      northern, and by degrees the southern, empire acquiesced in the
      government of Cublai, the lieutenant, and afterwards the
      successor, of Mangou; and the nation was loyal to a prince who
      had been educated in the manners of China. He restored the forms
      of her venerable constitution; and the victors submitted to the
      laws, the fashions, and even the prejudices, of the vanquished
      people. This peaceful triumph, which has been more than once
      repeated, may be ascribed, in a great measure, to the numbers and
      servitude of the Chinese. The Mogul army was dissolved in a vast
      and populous country; and their emperors adopted with pleasure a
      political system, which gives to the prince the solid substance
      of despotism, and leaves to the subject the empty names of
      philosophy, freedom, and filial obedience. 322 Under the reign of
      Cublai, letters and commerce, peace and justice, were restored;
      the great canal, of five hundred miles, was opened from Nankin to
      the capital: he fixed his residence at Pekin; and displayed in
      his court the magnificence of the greatest monarch of Asia. Yet
      this learned prince declined from the pure and simple religion of
      his great ancestor: he sacrificed to the idol Fo; and his blind
      attachment to the lamas of Thibet and the bonzes of China 33
      provoked the censure of the disciples of Confucius. His
      successors polluted the palace with a crowd of eunuchs,
      physicians, and astrologers, while thirteen millions of their
      subjects were consumed in the provinces by famine. One hundred
      and forty years after the death of Zingis, his degenerate race,
      the dynasty of the Yuen, was expelled by a revolt of the native
      Chinese; and the Mogul emperors were lost in the oblivion of the
      desert. Before this revolution, they had forfeited their
      supremacy over the dependent branches of their house, the khans
      of Kipzak and Russia, the khans of Zagatai, or Transoxiana, and
      the khans of Iran or Persia. By their distance and power, these
      royal lieutenants had soon been released from the duties of
      obedience; and after the death of Cublai, they scorned to accept
      a sceptre or a title from his unworthy successors. According to
      their respective situations, they maintained the simplicity of
      the pastoral life, or assumed the luxury of the cities of Asia;
      but the princes and their hordes were alike disposed for the
      reception of a foreign worship. After some hesitation between the
      Gospel and the Koran, they conformed to the religion of Mahomet;
      and while they adopted for their brethren the Arabs and Persians,
      they renounced all intercourse with the ancient Moguls, the
      idolaters of China.

      Chapter LXIV: Moguls, Ottoman Turks.—Part III.

      In this shipwreck of nations, some surprise may be excited by the
      escape of the Roman empire, whose relics, at the time of the
      Mogul invasion, were dismembered by the Greeks and Latins. Less
      potent than Alexander, they were pressed, like the Macedonian,
      both in Europe and Asia, by the shepherds of Scythia; and had the
      Tartars undertaken the siege, Constantinople must have yielded to
      the fate of Pekin, Samarcand, and Bagdad. The glorious and
      voluntary retreat of Batou from the Danube was insulted by the
      vain triumph of the Franks and Greeks; 34 and in a second
      expedition death surprised him in full march to attack the
      capital of the Cæsars. His brother Borga carried the Tartar arms
      into Bulgaria and Thrace; but he was diverted from the Byzantine
      war by a visit to Novogorod, in the fifty-seventh degree of
      latitude, where he numbered the inhabitants and regulated the
      tributes of Russia. The Mogul khan formed an alliance with the
      Mamalukes against his brethren of Persia: three hundred thousand
      horse penetrated through the gates of Derbend; and the Greeks
      might rejoice in the first example of domestic war. After the
      recovery of Constantinople, Michael Palæologus, 35 at a distance
      from his court and army, was surprised and surrounded in a
      Thracian castle, by twenty thousand Tartars. But the object of
      their march was a private interest: they came to the deliverance
      of Azzadin, the Turkish sultan; and were content with his person
      and the treasure of the emperor. Their general Noga, whose name
      is perpetuated in the hordes of Astracan, raised a formidable
      rebellion against Mengo Timour, the third of the khans of Kipzak;
      obtained in marriage Maria, the natural daughter of Palæologus;
      and guarded the dominions of his friend and father. The
      subsequent invasions of a Scythian cast were those of outlaws and
      fugitives: and some thousands of Alani and Comans, who had been
      driven from their native seats, were reclaimed from a vagrant
      life, and enlisted in the service of the empire. Such was the
      influence in Europe of the invasion of the Moguls. The first
      terror of their arms secured, rather than disturbed, the peace of
      the Roman Asia. The sultan of Iconium solicited a personal
      interview with John Vataces; and his artful policy encouraged the
      Turks to defend their barrier against the common enemy. 36 That
      barrier indeed was soon overthrown; and the servitude and ruin of
      the Seljukians exposed the nakedness of the Greeks. The
      formidable Holagou threatened to march to Constantinople at the
      head of four hundred thousand men; and the groundless panic of
      the citizens of Nice will present an image of the terror which he
      had inspired. The accident of a procession, and the sound of a
      doleful litany, “From the fury of the Tartars, good Lord, deliver
      us,” had scattered the hasty report of an assault and massacre.
      In the blind credulity of fear, the streets of Nice were crowded
      with thousands of both sexes, who knew not from what or to whom
      they fled; and some hours elapsed before the firmness of the
      military officers could relieve the city from this imaginary foe.
      But the ambition of Holagou and his successors was fortunately
      diverted by the conquest of Bagdad, and a long vicissitude of
      Syrian wars; their hostility to the Moslems inclined them to
      unite with the Greeks and Franks; 37 and their generosity or
      contempt had offered the kingdom of Anatolia as the reward of an
      Armenian vassal. The fragments of the Seljukian monarchy were
      disputed by the emirs who had occupied the cities or the
      mountains; but they all confessed the supremacy of the khans of
      Persia; and he often interposed his authority, and sometimes his
      arms, to check their depredations, and to preserve the peace and
      balance of his Turkish frontier. The death of Cazan, 38 one of
      the greatest and most accomplished princes of the house of
      Zingis, removed this salutary control; and the decline of the
      Moguls gave a free scope to the rise and progress of the Ottoman
      Empire. 39

      After the retreat of Zingis, the sultan Gelaleddin of Carizme had
      returned from India to the possession and defence of his Persian
      kingdoms. In the space of eleven years, that hero fought in
      person fourteen battles; and such was his activity, that he led
      his cavalry in seventeen days from Teflis to Kerman, a march of a
      thousand miles. Yet he was oppressed by the jealousy of the
      Moslem princes, and the innumerable armies of the Moguls; and
      after his last defeat, Gelaleddin perished ignobly in the
      mountains of Curdistan. His death dissolved a veteran and
      adventurous army, which included under the name of Carizmians or
      Corasmins many Turkman hordes, that had attached themselves to
      the sultan’s fortune. The bolder and more powerful chiefs invaded
      Syria, and violated the holy sepulchre of Jerusalem: the more
      humble engaged in the service of Aladin, sultan of Iconium; and
      among these were the obscure fathers of the Ottoman line. They
      had formerly pitched their tents near the southern banks of the
      Oxus, in the plains of Mahan and Nesa; and it is somewhat
      remarkable, that the same spot should have produced the first
      authors of the Parthian and Turkish empires. At the head, or in
      the rear, of a Carizmian army, Soliman Shah was drowned in the
      passage of the Euphrates: his son Orthogrul became the soldier
      and subject of Aladin, and established at Surgut, on the banks of
      the Sangar, a camp of four hundred families or tents, whom he
      governed fifty-two years both in peace and war. He was the father
      of Thaman, or Athman, whose Turkish name has been melted into the
      appellation of the caliph Othman; and if we describe that
      pastoral chief as a shepherd and a robber, we must separate from
      those characters all idea of ignominy and baseness. Othman
      possessed, and perhaps surpassed, the ordinary virtues of a
      soldier; and the circumstances of time and place were propitious
      to his independence and success. The Seljukian dynasty was no
      more; and the distance and decline of the Mogul khans soon
      enfranchised him from the control of a superior. He was situate
      on the verge of the Greek empire: the Koran sanctified his
      _gazi_, or holy war, against the infidels; and their political
      errors unlocked the passes of Mount Olympus, and invited him to
      descend into the plains of Bithynia. Till the reign of
      Palæologus, these passes had been vigilantly guarded by the
      militia of the country, who were repaid by their own safety and
      an exemption from taxes. The emperor abolished their privilege
      and assumed their office; but the tribute was rigorously
      collected, the custody of the passes was neglected, and the hardy
      mountaineers degenerated into a trembling crowd of peasants
      without spirit or discipline. It was on the twenty-seventh of
      July, in the year twelve hundred and ninety-nine of the Christian
      æra, that Othman first invaded the territory of Nicomedia; 40 and
      the singular accuracy of the date seems to disclose some
      foresight of the rapid and destructive growth of the monster. The
      annals of the twenty-seven years of his reign would exhibit a
      repetition of the same inroads; and his hereditary troops were
      multiplied in each campaign by the accession of captives and
      volunteers. Instead of retreating to the hills, he maintained the
      most useful and defensive posts; fortified the towns and castles
      which he had first pillaged; and renounced the pastoral life for
      the baths and palaces of his infant capitals. But it was not till
      Othman was oppressed by age and infirmities, that he received the
      welcome news of the conquest of Prusa, which had been surrendered
      by famine or treachery to the arms of his son Orchan. The glory
      of Othman is chiefly founded on that of his descendants; but the
      Turks have transcribed or composed a royal testament of his last
      counsels of justice and moderation. 41

      Nicephorus Gregoras, l. vii. c. l., and the first book of
      Laonicus Chalcondyles, the Athenian.]

      41 (return) [ I am ignorant whether the Turks have any writers
      older than Mahomet II., * nor can I reach beyond a meagre
      chronicle (Annales Turcici ad Annum 1550) translated by John
      Gaudier, and published by Leunclavius, (ad calcem Laonic.
      Chalcond. p. 311—350,) with copious pandects, or commentaries.
      The history of the Growth and Decay (A.D. 1300—1683) of the
      Othman empire was translated into English from the Latin MS. of
      Demetrius Cantemir, prince of Moldavia, (London, 1734, in folio.)
      The author is guilty of strange blunders in Oriental history; but
      he was conversant with the language, the annals, and institutions
      of the Turks. Cantemir partly draws his materials from the
      Synopsis of Saadi Effendi of Larissa, dedicated in the year 1696
      to Sultan Mustapha, and a valuable abridgment of the original
      historians. In one of the Ramblers, Dr. Johnson praises Knolles
      (a General History of the Turks to the present Year. London,
      1603) as the first of historians, unhappy only in the choice of
      his subject. Yet I much doubt whether a partial and verbose
      compilation from Latin writers, thirteen hundred folio pages of
      speeches and battles, can either instruct or amuse an enlightened
      age, which requires from the historian some tincture of
      philosophy and criticism. Note: * We could have wished that M.
      von Hammer had given a more clear and distinct reply to this
      question of Gibbon. In a note, vol. i. p. 630. M. von Hammer
      shows that they had not only sheiks (religious writers) and
      learned lawyers, but poets and authors on medicine. But the
      inquiry of Gibbon obviously refers to historians. The oldest of
      their historical works, of which V. Hammer makes use, is the
      “Tarichi Aaschik Paschasade,” i. e. the History of the Great
      Grandson of Aaschik Pasha, who was a dervis and celebrated
      ascetic poet in the reign of Murad (Amurath) I. Ahmed, the author
      of the work, lived during the reign of Bajazet II., but, he says,
      derived much information from the book of Scheik Jachshi, the son
      of Elias, who was Imaum to Sultan Orchan, (the second Ottoman
      king) and who related, from the lips of his father, the
      circumstances of the earliest Ottoman history. This book (having
      searched for it in vain for five-and-twenty years) our author
      found at length in the Vatican. All the other Turkish histories
      on his list, as indeed this, were _written_ during the reign of
      Mahomet II. It does not appear whether any of the rest cite
      earlier authorities of equal value with that claimed by the
      “Tarichi Aaschik Paschasade.”—M. (in Quarterly Review, vol. xlix.
      p. 292.)]

      From the conquest of Prusa, we may date the true æra of the
      Ottoman empire. The lives and possessions of the Christian
      subjects were redeemed by a tribute or ransom of thirty thousand
      crowns of gold; and the city, by the labors of Orchan, assumed
      the aspect of a Mahometan capital; Prusa was decorated with a
      mosque, a college, and a hospital, of royal foundation; the
      Seljukian coin was changed for the name and impression of the new
      dynasty: and the most skilful professors, of human and divine
      knowledge, attracted the Persian and Arabian students from the
      ancient schools of Oriental learning. The office of vizier was
      instituted for Aladin, the brother of Orchan; 411 and a different
      habit distinguished the citizens from the peasants, the Moslems
      from the infidels. All the troops of Othman had consisted of
      loose squadrons of Turkman cavalry; who served without pay and
      fought without discipline: but a regular body of infantry was
      first established and trained by the prudence of his son. A great
      number of volunteers was enrolled with a small stipend, but with
      the permission of living at home, unless they were summoned to
      the field: their rude manners, and seditious temper, disposed
      Orchan to educate his young captives as his soldiers and those of
      the prophet; but the Turkish peasants were still allowed to mount
      on horseback, and follow his standard, with the appellation and
      the hopes of _freebooters_. 412 By these arts he formed an army
      of twenty-five thousand Moslems: a train of battering engines was
      framed for the use of sieges; and the first successful experiment
      was made on the cities of Nice and Nicomedia. Orchan granted a
      safe-conduct to all who were desirous of departing with their
      families and effects; but the widows of the slain were given in
      marriage to the conquerors; and the sacrilegious plunder, the
      books, the vases, and the images, were sold or ransomed at
      Constantinople. The emperor Andronicus the Younger was vanquished
      and wounded by the son of Othman: 42 421 he subdued the whole
      province or kingdom of Bithynia, as far as the shores of the
      Bosphorus and Hellespont; and the Christians confessed the
      justice and clemency of a reign which claimed the voluntary
      attachment of the Turks of Asia. Yet Orchan was content with the
      modest title of emir; and in the list of his compeers, the
      princes of Roum or Anatolia, 43 his military forces were
      surpassed by the emirs of Ghermian and Caramania, each of whom
      could bring into the field an army of forty thousand men. Their
      domains were situate in the heart of the Seljukian kingdom; but
      the holy warriors, though of inferior note, who formed new
      principalities on the Greek empire, are more conspicuous in the
      light of history. The maritime country from the Propontis to the
      Mæander and the Isle of Rhodes, so long threatened and so often
      pillaged, was finally lost about the thirteenth year of
      Andronicus the Elder. 44 Two Turkish chieftains, Sarukhan and
      Aidin, left their names to their conquests, and their conquests
      to their posterity. The captivity or ruin of the _seven_ churches
      of Asia was consummated; and the barbarous lords of Ionia and
      Lydia still trample on the monuments of classic and Christian
      antiquity. In the loss of Ephesus, the Christians deplored the
      fall of the first angel, the extinction of the first candlestick,
      of the Revelations; 45 the desolation is complete; and the temple
      of Diana, or the church of Mary, will equally elude the search of
      the curious traveller. The circus and three stately theatres of
      Laodicea are now peopled with wolves and foxes; Sardes is reduced
      to a miserable village; the God of Mahomet, without a rival or a
      son, is invoked in the mosques of Thyatira and Pergamus; and the
      populousness of Smyrna is supported by the foreign trade of the
      Franks and Armenians. Philadelphia alone has been saved by
      prophecy, or courage. At a distance from the sea, forgotten by
      the emperors, encompassed on all sides by the Turks, her valiant
      citizens defended their religion and freedom above fourscore
      years; and at length capitulated with the proudest of the
      Ottomans. Among the Greek colonies and churches of Asia,
      Philadelphia is still erect; a column in a scene of ruins; a
      pleasing example, that the paths of honor and safety may
      sometimes be the same. The servitude of Rhodes was delayed about
      two centuries by the establishment of the knights of St. John of
      Jerusalem: 46 under the discipline of the order, that island
      emerged into fame and opulence; the noble and warlike monks were
      renowned by land and sea: and the bulwark of Christendom
      provoked, and repelled, the arms of the Turks and Saracens.

      ignorance, in supposing that Othman, a freebooter of the
      Bithynian hills, could besiege Rhodes by sea and land.]

      The Greeks, by their intestine divisions, were the authors of
      their final ruin. During the civil wars of the elder and younger
      Andronicus, the son of Othman achieved, almost without
      resistance, the conquest of Bithynia; and the same disorders
      encouraged the Turkish emirs of Lydia and Ionia to build a fleet,
      and to pillage the adjacent islands and the sea-coast of Europe.
      In the defence of his life and honor, Cantacuzene was tempted to
      prevent, or imitate, his adversaries, by calling to his aid the
      public enemies of his religion and country. Amir, the son of
      Aidin, concealed under a Turkish garb the humanity and politeness
      of a Greek; he was united with the great domestic by mutual
      esteem and reciprocal services; and their friendship is compared,
      in the vain rhetoric of the times, to the perfect union of
      Orestes and Pylades. 47 On the report of the danger of his
      friend, who was persecuted by an ungrateful court, the prince of
      Ionia assembled at Smyrna a fleet of three hundred vessels, with
      an army of twenty-nine thousand men; sailed in the depth of
      winter, and cast anchor at the mouth of the Hebrus. From thence,
      with a chosen band of two thousand Turks, he marched along the
      banks of the river, and rescued the empress, who was besieged in
      Demotica by the wild Bulgarians. At that disastrous moment, the
      life or death of his beloved Cantacuzene was concealed by his
      flight into Servia: but the grateful Irene, impatient to behold
      her deliverer, invited him to enter the city, and accompanied her
      message with a present of rich apparel and a hundred horses. By a
      peculiar strain of delicacy, the Gentle Barbarian refused, in the
      absence of an unfortunate friend, to visit his wife, or to taste
      the luxuries of the palace; sustained in his tent the rigor of
      the winter; and rejected the hospitable gift, that he might share
      the hardships of two thousand companions, all as deserving as
      himself of that honor and distinction. Necessity and revenge
      might justify his predatory excursions by sea and land: he left
      nine thousand five hundred men for the guard of his fleet; and
      persevered in the fruitless search of Cantacuzene, till his
      embarkation was hastened by a fictitious letter, the severity of
      the season, the clamors of his independent troops, and the weight
      of his spoil and captives. In the prosecution of the civil war,
      the prince of Ionia twice returned to Europe; joined his arms
      with those of the emperor; besieged Thessalonica, and threatened
      Constantinople. Calumny might affix some reproach on his
      imperfect aid, his hasty departure, and a bribe of ten thousand
      crowns, which he accepted from the Byzantine court; but his
      friend was satisfied; and the conduct of Amir is excused by the
      more sacred duty of defending against the Latins his hereditary
      dominions. The maritime power of the Turks had united the pope,
      the king of Cyprus, the republic of Venice, and the order of St.
      John, in a laudable crusade; their galleys invaded the coast of
      Ionia; and Amir was slain with an arrow, in the attempt to wrest
      from the Rhodian knights the citadel of Smyrna. 48 Before his
      death, he generously recommended another ally of his own nation;
      not more sincere or zealous than himself, but more able to afford
      a prompt and powerful succor, by his situation along the
      Propontis and in the front of Constantinople. By the prospect of
      a more advantageous treaty, the Turkish prince of Bithynia was
      detached from his engagements with Anne of Savoy; and the pride
      of Orchan dictated the most solemn protestations, that if he
      could obtain the daughter of Cantacuzene, he would invariably
      fulfil the duties of a subject and a son. Parental tenderness was
      silenced by the voice of ambition: the Greek clergy connived at
      the marriage of a Christian princess with a sectary of Mahomet;
      and the father of Theodora describes, with shameful satisfaction,
      the dishonor of the purple. 49 A body of Turkish cavalry attended
      the ambassadors, who disembarked from thirty vessels, before his
      camp of Selybria. A stately pavilion was erected, in which the
      empress Irene passed the night with her daughters. In the
      morning, Theodora ascended a throne, which was surrounded with
      curtains of silk and gold: the troops were under arms; but the
      emperor alone was on horseback. At a signal the curtains were
      suddenly withdrawn to disclose the bride, or the victim,
      encircled by kneeling eunuchs and hymeneal torches: the sound of
      flutes and trumpets proclaimed the joyful event; and her
      pretended happiness was the theme of the nuptial song, which was
      chanted by such poets as the age could produce. Without the rites
      of the church, Theodora was delivered to her barbarous lord: but
      it had been stipulated, that she should preserve her religion in
      the harem of Bursa; and her father celebrates her charity and
      devotion in this ambiguous situation. After his peaceful
      establishment on the throne of Constantinople, the Greek emperor
      visited his Turkish ally, who with four sons, by various wives,
      expected him at Scutari, on the Asiatic shore. The two princes
      partook, with seeming cordiality, of the pleasures of the banquet
      and the chase; and Theodora was permitted to repass the
      Bosphorus, and to enjoy some days in the society of her mother.
      But the friendship of Orchan was subservient to his religion and
      interest; and in the Genoese war he joined without a blush the
      enemies of Cantacuzene.

      In the treaty with the empress Anne, the Ottoman prince had
      inserted a singular condition, that it should be lawful for him
      to sell his prisoners at Constantinople, or transport them into
      Asia. A naked crowd of Christians of both sexes and every age, of
      priests and monks, of matrons and virgins, was exposed in the
      public market; the whip was frequently used to quicken the
      charity of redemption; and the indigent Greeks deplored the fate
      of their brethren, who were led away to the worst evils of
      temporal and spiritual bondage 50 Cantacuzene was reduced to
      subscribe the same terms; and their execution must have been
      still more pernicious to the empire: a body of ten thousand Turks
      had been detached to the assistance of the empress Anne; but the
      entire forces of Orchan were exerted in the service of his
      father. Yet these calamities were of a transient nature; as soon
      as the storm had passed away, the fugitives might return to their
      habitations; and at the conclusion of the civil and foreign wars,
      Europe was completely evacuated by the Moslems of Asia. It was in
      his last quarrel with his pupil that Cantacuzene inflicted the
      deep and deadly wound, which could never be healed by his
      successors, and which is poorly expiated by his theological
      dialogues against the prophet Mahomet. Ignorant of their own
      history, the modern Turks confound their first and their final
      passage of the Hellespont, 51 and describe the son of Orchan as a
      nocturnal robber, who, with eighty companions, explores by
      stratagem a hostile and unknown shore. Soliman, at the head of
      ten thousand horse, was transported in the vessels, and
      entertained as the friend, of the Greek emperor. In the civil
      wars of Romania, he performed some service and perpetrated more
      mischief; but the Chersonesus was insensibly filled with a
      Turkish colony; and the Byzantine court solicited in vain the
      restitution of the fortresses of Thrace. After some artful delays
      between the Ottoman prince and his son, their ransom was valued
      at sixty thousand crowns, and the first payment had been made
      when an earthquake shook the walls and cities of the provinces;
      the dismantled places were occupied by the Turks; and Gallipoli,
      the key of the Hellespont, was rebuilt and repeopled by the
      policy of Soliman. The abdication of Cantacuzene dissolved the
      feeble bands of domestic alliance; and his last advice admonished
      his countrymen to decline a rash contest, and to compare their
      own weakness with the numbers and valor, the discipline and
      enthusiasm, of the Moslems. His prudent counsels were despised by
      the headstrong vanity of youth, and soon justified by the
      victories of the Ottomans. But as he practised in the field the
      exercise of the _jerid_, Soliman was killed by a fall from his
      horse; and the aged Orchan wept and expired on the tomb of his
      valiant son. 511

      Chapter LXIV: Moguls, Ottoman Turks.—Part IV.

      But the Greeks had not time to rejoice in the death of their
      enemies; and the Turkish cimeter was wielded with the same spirit
      by Amurath the First, the son of Orchan, and the brother of
      Soliman. By the pale and fainting light of the Byzantine annals,
      52 we can discern, that he subdued without resistance the whole
      province of Romania or Thrace, from the Hellespont to Mount
      Hæmus, and the verge of the capital; and that Adrianople was
      chosen for the royal seat of his government and religion in
      Europe. Constantinople, whose decline is almost coeval with her
      foundation, had often, in the lapse of a thousand years, been
      assaulted by the Barbarians of the East and West; but never till
      this fatal hour had the Greeks been surrounded, both in Asia and
      Europe, by the arms of the same hostile monarchy. Yet the
      prudence or generosity of Amurath postponed for a while this easy
      conquest; and his pride was satisfied with the frequent and
      humble attendance of the emperor John Palæologus and his four
      sons, who followed at his summons the court and camp of the
      Ottoman prince. He marched against the Sclavonian nations between
      the Danube and the Adriatic, the Bulgarians, Servians, Bosnians,
      and Albanians; and these warlike tribes, who had so often
      insulted the majesty of the empire, were repeatedly broken by his
      destructive inroads. Their countries did not abound either in
      gold or silver; nor were their rustic hamlets and townships
      enriched by commerce or decorated by the arts of luxury. But the
      natives of the soil have been distinguished in every age by their
      hardiness of mind and body; and they were converted by a prudent
      institution into the firmest and most faithful supporters of the
      Ottoman greatness. 53 The vizier of Amurath reminded his
      sovereign that, according to the Mahometan law, he was entitled
      to a fifth part of the spoil and captives; and that the duty
      might easily be levied, if vigilant officers were stationed in
      Gallipoli, to watch the passage, and to select for his use the
      stoutest and most beautiful of the Christian youth. The advice
      was followed: the edict was proclaimed; many thousands of the
      European captives were educated in religion and arms; and the new
      militia was consecrated and named by a celebrated dervis.
      Standing in the front of their ranks, he stretched the sleeve of
      his gown over the head of the foremost soldier, and his blessing
      was delivered in these words: “Let them be called Janizaries,
      (_Yengi cheri_, or new soldiers;) may their countenance be ever
      bright! their hand victorious! their sword keen! may their spear
      always hang over the heads of their enemies! and wheresoever they
      go, may they return with a _white face!_” 54 541 Such was the
      origin of these haughty troops, the terror of the nations, and
      sometimes of the sultans themselves. Their valor has declined,
      their discipline is relaxed, and their tumultuary array is
      incapable of contending with the order and weapons of modern
      tactics; but at the time of their institution, they possessed a
      decisive superiority in war; since a regular body of infantry, in
      constant exercise and pay, was not maintained by any of the
      princes of Christendom. The Janizaries fought with the zeal of
      proselytes against their _idolatrous_ countrymen; and in the
      battle of Cossova, the league and independence of the Sclavonian
      tribes was finally crushed. As the conqueror walked over the
      field, he observed that the greatest part of the slain consisted
      of beardless youths; and listened to the flattering reply of his
      vizier, that age and wisdom would have taught them not to oppose
      his irresistible arms. But the sword of his Janizaries could not
      defend him from the dagger of despair; a Servian soldier started
      from the crowd of dead bodies, and Amurath was pierced in the
      belly with a mortal wound. 542 The grandson of Othman was mild in
      his temper, modest in his apparel, and a lover of learning and
      virtue; but the Moslems were scandalized at his absence from
      public worship; and he was corrected by the firmness of the
      mufti, who dared to reject his testimony in a civil cause: a
      mixture of servitude and freedom not unfrequent in Oriental
      history. 55

      heightened the romance. See likewise in Von Hammer (Osmanische

      resembles that of Ducas, and may have been the source of that of
      his Italian translator. The Turkish account agrees more nearly
      with Gibbon; but the Servian, (Milosch Kohilovisch) while he lay
      among the heap of the dead, pretended to have some secret to
      impart to Amurath, and stabbed him while he leaned over to
      listen.—M.]

      sultan was stabbed by a Croat in his tent; and this accident was

      unworthy precaution of pinioning, as if were, between two
      attendants, an ambassador’s arms, when he is introduced to the
      royal presence.]

      The character of Bajazet, the son and successor of Amurath, is
      strongly expressed in his surname of _Ilderim_, or the lightning;
      and he might glory in an epithet, which was drawn from the fiery
      energy of his soul and the rapidity of his destructive march. In
      the fourteen years of his reign, 56 he incessantly moved at the
      head of his armies, from Boursa to Adrianople, from the Danube to
      the Euphrates; and, though he strenuously labored for the
      propagation of the law, he invaded, with impartial ambition, the
      Christian and Mahometan princes of Europe and Asia. From Angora
      to Amasia and Erzeroum, the northern regions of Anatolia were
      reduced to his obedience: he stripped of their hereditary
      possessions his brother emirs of Ghermian and Caramania, of Aidin
      and Sarukhan; and after the conquest of Iconium the ancient
      kingdom of the Seljukians again revived in the Ottoman dynasty.
      Nor were the conquests of Bajazet less rapid or important in
      Europe. No sooner had he imposed a regular form of servitude on
      the Servians and Bulgarians, than he passed the Danube to seek
      new enemies and new subjects in the heart of Moldavia. 57
      Whatever yet adhered to the Greek empire in Thrace, Macedonia,
      and Thessaly, acknowledged a Turkish master: an obsequious bishop
      led him through the gates of Thermopylæ into Greece; and we may
      observe, as a singular fact, that the widow of a Spanish chief,
      who possessed the ancient seat of the oracle of Delphi, deserved
      his favor by the sacrifice of a beauteous daughter. The Turkish
      communication between Europe and Asia had been dangerous and
      doubtful, till he stationed at Gallipoli a fleet of galleys, to
      command the Hellespont and intercept the Latin succors of
      Constantinople. While the monarch indulged his passions in a
      boundless range of injustice and cruelty, he imposed on his
      soldiers the most rigid laws of modesty and abstinence; and the
      harvest was peaceably reaped and sold within the precincts of his
      camp. Provoked by the loose and corrupt administration of
      justice, he collected in a house the judges and lawyers of his
      dominions, who expected that in a few moments the fire would be
      kindled to reduce them to ashes. His ministers trembled in
      silence: but an Æthiopian buffoon presumed to insinuate the true
      cause of the evil; and future venality was left without excuse,
      by annexing an adequate salary to the office of cadhi. 58 The
      humble title of emir was no longer suitable to the Ottoman
      greatness; and Bajazet condescended to accept a patent of sultan
      from the caliphs who served in Egypt under the yoke of the
      Mamalukes: 59 a last and frivolous homage that was yielded by
      force to opinion; by the Turkish conquerors to the house of Abbas
      and the successors of the Arabian prophet. The ambition of the
      sultan was inflamed by the obligation of deserving this august
      title; and he turned his arms against the kingdom of Hungary, the
      perpetual theatre of the Turkish victories and defeats.
      Sigismond, the Hungarian king, was the son and brother of the
      emperors of the West: his cause was that of Europe and the
      church; and, on the report of his danger, the bravest knights of
      France and Germany were eager to march under his standard and
      that of the cross. In the battle of Nicopolis, Bajazet defeated a
      confederate army of a hundred thousand Christians, who had
      proudly boasted, that if the sky should fall, they could uphold
      it on their lances. The far greater part were slain or driven
      into the Danube; and Sigismond, escaping to Constantinople by the
      river and the Black Sea, returned after a long circuit to his
      exhausted kingdom. 60 In the pride of victory, Bajazet threatened
      that he would besiege Buda; that he would subdue the adjacent
      countries of Germany and Italy, and that he would feed his horse
      with a bushel of oats on the altar of St. Peter at Rome. His
      progress was checked, not by the miraculous interposition of the
      apostle, not by a crusade of the Christian powers, but by a long
      and painful fit of the gout. The disorders of the moral, are
      sometimes corrected by those of the physical, world; and an
      acrimonious humor falling on a single fibre of one man, may
      prevent or suspend the misery of nations.

      kingdom. Yet, if it be extant and accessible, I should give the
      preference to some homely chronicle of the time and country.]

      Such is the general idea of the Hungarian war; but the disastrous
      adventure of the French has procured us some memorials which
      illustrate the victory and character of Bajazet. 61 The duke of
      Burgundy, sovereign of Flanders, and uncle of Charles the Sixth,
      yielded to the ardor of his son, John count of Nevers; and the
      fearless youth was accompanied by four princes, his _cousins_,
      and those of the French monarch. Their inexperience was guided by
      the Sire de Coucy, one of the best and oldest captain of
      Christendom; 62 but the constable, admiral, and marshal of France
      63 commanded an army which did not exceed the number of a
      thousand knights and squires. 631 These splendid names were the
      source of presumption and the bane of discipline. So many might
      aspire to command, that none were willing to obey; their national
      spirit despised both their enemies and their allies; and in the
      persuasion that Bajazet _would_ fly, or _must_ fall, they began
      to compute how soon they should visit Constantinople and deliver
      the holy sepulchre. When their scouts announced the approach of
      the Turks, the gay and thoughtless youths were at table, already
      heated with wine; they instantly clasped their armor, mounted
      their horses, rode full speed to the vanguard, and resented as an
      affront the advice of Sigismond, which would have deprived them
      of the right and honor of the foremost attack. The battle of
      Nicopolis would not have been lost, if the French would have
      obeyed the prudence of the Hungarians; but it might have been
      gloriously won, had the Hungarians imitated the valor of the
      French. They dispersed the first line, consisting of the troops
      of Asia; forced a rampart of stakes, which had been planted
      against the cavalry; broke, after a bloody conflict, the
      Janizaries themselves; and were at length overwhelmed by the
      numerous squadrons that issued from the woods, and charged on all
      sides this handful of intrepid warriors. In the speed and secrecy
      of his march, in the order and evolutions of the battle, his
      enemies felt and admired the military talents of Bajazet. They
      accuse his cruelty in the use of victory. After reserving the
      count of Nevers, and four-and-twenty lords, 632 whose birth and
      riches were attested by his Latin interpreters, the remainder of
      the French captives, who had survived the slaughter of the day,
      were led before his throne; and, as they refused to abjure their
      faith, were successively beheaded in his presence. The sultan was
      exasperated by the loss of his bravest Janizaries; and if it be
      true, that, on the eve of the engagement, the French had
      massacred their Turkish prisoners, 64 they might impute to
      themselves the consequences of a just retaliation. 641 A knight,
      whose life had been spared, was permitted to return to Paris,
      that he might relate the deplorable tale, and solicit the ransom
      of the noble captives. In the mean while, the count of Nevers,
      with the princes and barons of France, were dragged along in the
      marches of the Turkish camp, exposed as a grateful trophy to the
      Moslems of Europe and Asia, and strictly confined at Boursa, as
      often as Bajazet resided in his capital. The sultan was pressed
      each day to expiate with their blood the blood of his martyrs;
      but he had pronounced that they should live, and either for mercy
      or destruction his word was irrevocable. He was assured of their
      value and importance by the return of the messenger, and the
      gifts and intercessions of the kings of France and of Cyprus.
      Lusignan presented him with a gold saltcellar of curious
      workmanship, and of the price of ten thousand ducats; and Charles
      the Sixth despatched by the way of Hungary a cast of Norwegian
      hawks, and six horse-loads of scarlet cloth, of fine linen of
      Rheims, and of Arras tapestry, representing the battles of the
      great Alexander. After much delay, the effect of distance rather
      than of art, Bajazet agreed to accept a ransom of two hundred
      thousand ducats for the count of Nevers and the surviving princes
      and barons: the marshal Boucicault, a famous warrior, was of the
      number of the fortunate; but the admiral of France had been slain
      in battle; and the constable, with the Sire de Coucy, died in the
      prison of Boursa. This heavy demand, which was doubled by
      incidental costs, fell chiefly on the duke of Burgundy, or rather
      on his Flemish subjects, who were bound by the feudal laws to
      contribute for the knighthood and captivity of the eldest son of
      their lord. For the faithful discharge of the debt, some
      merchants of Genoa gave security to the amount of five times the
      sum; a lesson to those warlike times, that commerce and credit
      are the links of the society of nations. It had been stipulated
      in the treaty, that the French captives should swear never to
      bear arms against the person of their conqueror; but the
      ungenerous restraint was abolished by Bajazet himself. “I
      despise,” said he to the heir of Burgundy, “thy oaths and thy
      arms. Thou art young, and mayest be ambitious of effacing the
      disgrace or misfortune of thy first chivalry. Assemble thy
      powers, proclaim thy design, and be assured that Bajazet will
      rejoice to meet thee a second time in a field of battle.” Before
      their departure, they were indulged in the freedom and
      hospitality of the court of Boursa. The French princes admired
      the magnificence of the Ottoman, whose hunting and hawking
      equipage was composed of seven thousand huntsmen and seven
      thousand falconers. 65 In their presence, and at his command, the
      belly of one of his chamberlains was cut open, on a complaint
      against him for drinking the goat’s milk of a poor woman. The
      strangers were astonished by this act of justice; but it was the
      justice of a sultan who disdains to balance the weight of
      evidence, or to measure the degrees of guilt.

      others, on account of their extreme youth. No one under 20 years
      of age was put to death. The “duke of Burgundy” was obliged to be
      a spectator of this butchery which lasted from early in the
      morning till four o’clock, P. M. It ceased only at the

      65 (return) [ Sherefeddin Ali (Hist. de Timour Bec, l. v. c. 13)
      allows Bajazet a round number of 12,000 officers and servants of

      hunting-match of Timour, l. hounds with satin housings; 2.
      leopards with collars set with jewels; 3. Grecian greyhounds; and
      4, dogs from Europe, as strong as African lions, (idem, l. vi. c.
      15.) Bajazet was particularly fond of flying his hawks at cranes,
      (Chalcondyles, l. ii. p. 85.)]

      After his enfranchisement from an oppressive guardian, John
      Palæologus remained thirty-six years, the helpless, and, as it
      should seem, the careless spectator of the public ruin. 66 Love,
      or rather lust, was his only vigorous passion; and in the
      embraces of the wives and virgins of the city, the Turkish slave
      forgot the dishonor of the emperor of the _Romans_ Andronicus,
      his eldest son, had formed, at Adrianople, an intimate and guilty
      friendship with Sauzes, the son of Amurath; and the two youths
      conspired against the authority and lives of their parents. The
      presence of Amurath in Europe soon discovered and dissipated
      their rash counsels; and, after depriving Sauzes of his sight,
      the Ottoman threatened his vassal with the treatment of an
      accomplice and an enemy, unless he inflicted a similar punishment
      on his own son. Palæologus trembled and obeyed; and a cruel
      precaution involved in the same sentence the childhood and
      innocence of John, the son of the criminal. But the operation was
      so mildly, or so unskilfully, performed, that the one retained
      the sight of an eye, and the other was afflicted only with the
      infirmity of squinting. Thus excluded from the succession, the
      two princes were confined in the tower of Anema; and the piety of
      Manuel, the second son of the reigning monarch, was rewarded with
      the gift of the Imperial crown. But at the end of two years, the
      turbulence of the Latins and the levity of the Greeks, produced a
      revolution; 661 and the two emperors were buried in the tower
      from whence the two prisoners were exalted to the throne. Another
      period of two years afforded Palæologus and Manuel the means of
      escape: it was contrived by the magic or subtlety of a monk, who
      was alternately named the angel or the devil: they fled to
      Scutari; their adherents armed in their cause; and the two
      Byzantine factions displayed the ambition and animosity with
      which Cæsar and Pompey had disputed the empire of the world. The
      Roman world was now contracted to a corner of Thrace, between the
      Propontis and the Black Sea, about fifty miles in length and
      thirty in breadth; a space of ground not more extensive than the
      lesser principalities of Germany or Italy, if the remains of
      Constantinople had not still represented the wealth and
      populousness of a kingdom. To restore the public peace, it was
      found necessary to divide this fragment of the empire; and while
      Palæologus and Manuel were left in possession of the capital,
      almost all that lay without the walls was ceded to the blind
      princes, who fixed their residence at Rhodosto and Selybria. In
      the tranquil slumber of royalty, the passions of John Palæologus
      survived his reason and his strength: he deprived his favorite
      and heir of a blooming princess of Trebizond; and while the
      feeble emperor labored to consummate his nuptials, Manuel, with a
      hundred of the noblest Greeks, was sent on a peremptory summons
      to the Ottoman _porte_. They served with honor in the wars of
      Bajazet; but a plan of fortifying Constantinople excited his
      jealousy: he threatened their lives; the new works were instantly
      demolished; and we shall bestow a praise, perhaps above the merit
      of Palæologus, if we impute this last humiliation as the cause of
      his death.

      subject is drowned in a sea of episode.]

      661 (return) [ According to Von Hammer it was the power of
      Bajazet, vol. i. p. 218.]

      The earliest intelligence of that event was communicated to
      Manuel, who escaped with speed and secrecy from the palace of
      Boursa to the Byzantine throne. Bajazet affected a proud
      indifference at the loss of this valuable pledge; and while he
      pursued his conquests in Europe and Asia, he left the emperor to
      struggle with his blind cousin John of Selybria, who, in eight
      years of civil war, asserted his right of primogeniture. At
      length, the ambition of the victorious sultan pointed to the
      conquest of Constantinople; but he listened to the advice of his
      vizier, who represented that such an enterprise might unite the
      powers of Christendom in a second and more formidable crusade.
      His epistle to the emperor was conceived in these words: “By the
      divine clemency, our invincible cimeter has reduced to our
      obedience almost all Asia, with many and large countries in
      Europe, excepting only the city of Constantinople; for beyond the
      walls thou hast nothing left. Resign that city; stipulate thy
      reward; or tremble, for thyself and thy unhappy people, at the
      consequences of a rash refusal.” But his ambassadors were
      instructed to soften their tone, and to propose a treaty, which
      was subscribed with submission and gratitude. A truce of ten
      years was purchased by an annual tribute of thirty thousand
      crowns of gold; the Greeks deplored the public toleration of the
      law of Mahomet, and Bajazet enjoyed the glory of establishing a
      Turkish cadhi, and founding a royal mosque in the metropolis of
      the Eastern church. 67 Yet this truce was soon violated by the
      restless sultan: in the cause of the prince of Selybria, the
      lawful emperor, an army of Ottomans again threatened
      Constantinople; and the distress of Manuel implored the
      protection of the king of France. His plaintive embassy obtained
      much pity and some relief; and the conduct of the succor was
      intrusted to the marshal Boucicault, 68 whose religious chivalry
      was inflamed by the desire of revenging his captivity on the
      infidels. He sailed with four ships of war, from Aiguesmortes to
      the Hellespont; forced the passage, which was guarded by
      seventeen Turkish galleys; landed at Constantinople a supply of
      six hundred men-at-arms and sixteen hundred archers; and reviewed
      them in the adjacent plain, without condescending to number or
      array the multitude of Greeks. By his presence, the blockade was
      raised both by sea and land; the flying squadrons of Bajazet were
      driven to a more respectful distance; and several castles in
      Europe and Asia were stormed by the emperor and the marshal, who
      fought with equal valor by each other’s side. But the Ottomans
      soon returned with an increase of numbers; and the intrepid
      Boucicault, after a year’s struggle, resolved to evacuate a
      country which could no longer afford either pay or provisions for
      his soldiers. The marshal offered to conduct Manuel to the French
      court, where he might solicit in person a supply of men and
      money; and advised, in the mean while, that, to extinguish all
      domestic discord, he should leave his blind competitor on the
      throne. The proposal was embraced: the prince of Selybria was
      introduced to the capital; and such was the public misery, that
      the lot of the exile seemed more fortunate than that of the
      sovereign. Instead of applauding the success of his vassal, the
      Turkish sultan claimed the city as his own; and on the refusal of
      the emperor John, Constantinople was more closely pressed by the
      calamities of war and famine. Against such an enemy prayers and
      resistance were alike unavailing; and the savage would have
      devoured his prey, if, in the fatal moment, he had not been
      overthrown by another savage stronger than himself. By the
      victory of Timour or Tamerlane, the fall of Constantinople was
      delayed about fifty years; and this important, though accidental,
      service may justly introduce the life and character of the Mogul
      conqueror.
