     Acts And Death Of Theodoric.

      After the fall of the Roman empire in the West, an interval of
      fifty years, till the memorable reign of Justinian, is faintly
      marked by the obscure names and imperfect annals of Zeno,
      Anastasius, and Justin, who successively ascended to the throne
      of Constantinople. During the same period, Italy revived and
      flourished under the government of a Gothic king, who might have
      deserved a statue among the best and bravest of the ancient
      Romans.

      Theodoric the Ostrogoth, the fourteenth in lineal descent of the
      royal line of the Amali, 1 was born in the neighborhood of Vienna
      2 two years after the death of Attila. 2111 A recent victory had
      restored the independence of the Ostrogoths; and the three
      brothers, Walamir, Theodemir, and Widimir, who ruled that warlike
      nation with united counsels, had separately pitched their
      habitations in the fertile though desolate province of Pannonia.
      The Huns still threatened their revolted subjects, but their
      hasty attack was repelled by the single forces of Walamir, and
      the news of his victory reached the distant camp of his brother
      in the same auspicious moment that the favorite concubine of
      Theodemir was delivered of a son and heir. In the eighth year of
      his age, Theodoric was reluctantly yielded by his father to the
      public interest, as the pledge of an alliance which Leo, emperor
      of the East, had consented to purchase by an annual subsidy of
      three hundred pounds of gold. The royal hostage was educated at
      Constantinople with care and tenderness. His body was formed to
      all the exercises of war, his mind was expanded by the habits of
      liberal conversation; he frequented the schools of the most
      skilful masters; but he disdained or neglected the arts of
      Greece, and so ignorant did he always remain of the first
      elements of science, that a rude mark was contrived to represent
      the signature of the illiterate king of Italy. 3 As soon as he
      had attained the age of eighteen, he was restored to the wishes
      of the Ostrogoths, whom the emperor aspired to gain by liberality
      and confidence. Walamir had fallen in battle; the youngest of the
      brothers, Widimir, had led away into Italy and Gaul an army of
      Barbarians, and the whole nation acknowledged for their king the
      father of Theodoric. His ferocious subjects admired the strength
      and stature of their young prince; 4 and he soon convinced them
      that he had not degenerated from the valor of his ancestors. At
      the head of six thousand volunteers, he secretly left the camp in
      quest of adventures, descended the Danube as far as Singidunum,
      or Belgrade, and soon returned to his father with the spoils of a
      Sarmatian king whom he had vanquished and slain. Such triumphs,
      however, were productive only of fame, and the invincible
      Ostrogoths were reduced to extreme distress by the want of
      clothing and food. They unanimously resolved to desert their
      Pannonian encampments, and boldly to advance into the warm and
      wealthy neighborhood of the Byzantine court, which already
      maintained in pride and luxury so many bands of confederate
      Goths. After proving, by some acts of hostility, that they could
      be dangerous, or at least troublesome, enemies, the Ostrogoths
      sold at a high price their reconciliation and fidelity, accepted
      a donative of lands and money, and were intrusted with the
      defence of the Lower Danube, under the command of Theodoric, who
      succeeded after his father’s death to the hereditary throne of
      the Amali. 5

      1 (return) [ Jornandes (de Rebus Geticis, c. 13, 14, p. 629, 630,
      edit. Grot.) has drawn the pedigree of Theodoric from Gapt, one
      of the Anses or Demigods, who lived about the time of Domitian.
      Cassiodorus, the first who celebrates the royal race of the
      Amali, (Viriar. viii. 5, ix. 25, x. 2, xi. 1,) reckons the
      grandson of Theodoric as the xviith in descent. Peringsciold (the
      Swedish commentator of Cochloeus, Vit. Theodoric. p. 271, &c.,
      Stockholm, 1699) labors to connect this genealogy with the
      legends or traditions of his native country. * Note: Amala was a
      name of hereditary sanctity and honor among the Visigoths. It
      enters into the names of Amalaberga, Amala suintha, (swinther
      means strength,) Amalafred, Amalarich. In the poem of the
      Nibelungen written three hundred years later, the Ostrogoths are
      called the Amilungen. According to Wachter it means, unstained,
      from the privative a, and malo a stain. It is pure Sanscrit,
      Amala, immaculatus. Schlegel. Indische Bibliothek, 1. p. 233.—M.]

      3 (return) [ The four first letters of his name were inscribed on
      a gold plate, and when it was fixed on the paper, the king drew
      his pen through the intervals (Anonym. Valesian. ad calcem Amm.

      Procopius, or at least of the contemporary Goths, (Gothic. 1. i.
      c. 2, p. 311,) far outweighs the vague praises of Ennodius
      (Sirmond Opera, tom. i. p. 1596) and Theophanes, (Chronograph. p.
      112.) * Note: Le Beau and his Commentator, M. St. Martin,

      opinion. But Lord Mahon (Life of Belisarius, p. 19) urges the
      much stronger argument, the Byzantine education of Theodroic.—M.]

      Theodoric, are found in Jornandes, (c. 52—56, p. 689—696) and

      the son of Walamir.]

      A hero, descended from a race of kings, must have despised the
      base Isaurian who was invested with the Roman purple, without any
      endowment of mind or body, without any advantages of royal birth,
      or superior qualifications. After the failure of the Theodosian
      line, the choice of Pulcheria and of the senate might be
      justified in some measure by the characters of Martin and Leo,
      but the latter of these princes confirmed and dishonored his
      reign by the perfidious murder of Aspar and his sons, who too
      rigorously exacted the debt of gratitude and obedience. The
      inheritance of Leo and of the East was peaceably devolved on his
      infant grandson, the son of his daughter Ariadne; and her
      Isaurian husband, the fortunate Trascalisseus, exchanged that
      barbarous sound for the Grecian appellation of Zeno. After the
      decease of the elder Leo, he approached with unnatural respect
      the throne of his son, humbly received, as a gift, the second
      rank in the empire, and soon excited the public suspicion on the
      sudden and premature death of his young colleague, whose life
      could no longer promote the success of his ambition. But the
      palace of Constantinople was ruled by female influence, and
      agitated by female passions: and Verina, the widow of Leo,
      claiming his empire as her own, pronounced a sentence of
      deposition against the worthless and ungrateful servant on whom
      she alone had bestowed the sceptre of the East. 6 As soon as she
      sounded a revolt in the ears of Zeno, he fled with precipitation
      into the mountains of Isauria, and her brother Basiliscus,
      already infamous by his African expedition, 7 was unanimously
      proclaimed by the servile senate. But the reign of the usurper
      was short and turbulent. Basiliscus presumed to assassinate the
      lover of his sister; he dared to offend the lover of his wife,
      the vain and insolent Harmatius, who, in the midst of Asiatic
      luxury, affected the dress, the demeanor, and the surname of
      Achilles. 8 By the conspiracy of the malcontent s, Zeno was
      recalled from exile; the armies, the capital, the person, of
      Basiliscus, were betrayed; and his whole family was condemned to
      the long agony of cold and hunger by the inhuman conqueror, who
      wanted courage to encounter or to forgive his enemies. 811 The
      haughty spirit of Verina was still incapable of submission or
      repose. She provoked the enmity of a favorite general, embraced
      his cause as soon as he was disgraced, created a new emperor in
      Syria and Egypt, 812 raised an army of seventy thousand men, and
      persisted to the last moment of her life in a fruitless
      rebellion, which, according to the fashion of the age, had been
      predicted by Christian hermits and Pagan magicians. While the
      East was afflicted by the passions of Verina, her daughter
      Ariadne was distinguished by the female virtues of mildness and
      fidelity; she followed her husband in his exile, and after his
      restoration, she implored his clemency in favor of her mother. On
      the decease of Zeno, Ariadne, the daughter, the mother, and the
      widow of an emperor, gave her hand and the Imperial title to
      Anastasius, an aged domestic of the palace, who survived his
      elevation above twenty-seven years, and whose character is
      attested by the acclamation of the people, “Reign as you have
      lived!” 9 912

      Gibbon. It is vague and pedantic, and contains few facts. The
      same criticism will apply to the poetical panegyric of Priscian
      edited from the Ms. of Bobbio by Ang. Mai. Priscian, the gram
      marian, Niebuhr argues from this work, must have been born in the
      African, not in either of the Asiatic Caesareas. Pref. p. xi.—M.]

      Whatever fear of affection could bestow, was profusely lavished
      by Zeno on the king of the Ostrogoths; the rank of patrician and
      consul, the command of the Palatine troops, an equestrian statue,
      a treasure in gold and silver of many thousand pounds, the name
      of son, and the promise of a rich and honorable wife. As long as
      Theodoric condescended to serve, he supported with courage and
      fidelity the cause of his benefactor; his rapid march contributed
      to the restoration of Zeno; and in the second revolt, the
      Walamirs, as they were called, pursued and pressed the Asiatic
      rebels, till they left an easy victory to the Imperial troops. 10
      But the faithful servant was suddenly converted into a formidable
      enemy, who spread the flames of war from Constantinople to the
      Adriatic; many flourishing cities were reduced to ashes, and the
      agriculture of Thrace was almost extirpated by the wanton cruelty
      of the Goths, who deprived their captive peasants of the right
      hand that guided the plough. 11 On such occasions, Theodoric
      sustained the loud and specious reproach of disloyalty, of
      ingratitude, and of insatiate avarice, which could be only
      excused by the hard necessity of his situation. He reigned, not
      as the monarch, but as the minister of a ferocious people, whose
      spirit was unbroken by slavery, and impatient of real or
      imaginary insults. Their poverty was incurable; since the most
      liberal donatives were soon dissipated in wasteful luxury, and
      the most fertile estates became barren in their hands; they
      despised, but they envied, the laborious provincials; and when
      their subsistence had failed, the Ostrogoths embraced the
      familiar resources of war and rapine. It had been the wish of
      Theodoric (such at least was his declaration) to lead a peaceful,
      obscure, obedient life on the confines of Scythia, till the
      Byzantine court, by splendid and fallacious promises, seduced him
      to attack a confederate tribe of Goths, who had been engaged in
      the party of Basiliscus. He marched from his station in Maesia,
      on the solemn assurance that before he reached Adrianople, he
      should meet a plentiful convoy of provisions, and a reenforcement
      of eight thousand horse and thirty thousand foot, while the
      legions of Asia were encamped at Heraclea to second his
      operations. These measures were disappointed by mutual jealousy.
      As he advanced into Thrace, the son of Theodemir found an
      inhospitable solitude, and his Gothic followers, with a heavy
      train of horses, of mules, and of wagons, were betrayed by their
      guides among the rocks and precipices of Mount Sondis, where he
      was assaulted by the arms and invectives of Theodoric the son of
      Triarius. From a neighboring height, his artful rival harangued
      the camp of the Walamirs, and branded their leader with the
      opprobrious names of child, of madman, of perjured traitor, the
      enemy of his blood and nation. “Are you ignorant,” exclaimed the
      son of Triarius, “that it is the constant policy of the Romans to
      destroy the Goths by each other’s swords? Are you insensible that
      the victor in this unnatural contest will be exposed, and justly
      exposed, to their implacable revenge? Where are those warriors,
      my kinsmen and thy own, whose widows now lament that their lives
      were sacrificed to thy rash ambition? Where is the wealth which
      thy soldiers possessed when they were first allured from their
      native homes to enlist under thy standard? Each of them was then
      master of three or four horses; they now follow thee on foot,
      like slaves, through the deserts of Thrace; those men who were
      tempted by the hope of measuring gold with a bushel, those brave
      men who are as free and as noble as thyself.” A language so well
      suited to the temper of the Goths excited clamor and discontent;
      and the son of Theodemir, apprehensive of being left alone, was
      compelled to embrace his brethren, and to imitate the example of
      Roman perfidy. 12 1211

      717,) Liberatus, (Brev. Eutych. c. 25 p. 118,) and Theophanes,
      (p. 112,) is more sober and rational.]

      11 (return) [ This cruel practice is specially imputed to the
      Triarian Goths, less barbarous, as it should seem, than the
      Walamirs; but the son of Theodemir is charged with the ruin of
      many Roman cities, (Malchus, Excerpt. Leg. p. 95.)]

      12 (return) [ Jornandes (c. 56, 57, p. 696) displays the services
      of Theodoric, confesses his rewards, but dissembles his revolt,
      of which such curious details have been preserved by Malchus,
      (Excerpt. Legat. p. 78—97.) Marcellinus, a domestic of Justinian,
      under whose ivth consulship (A.D. 534) he composed his Chronicle,
      (Scaliger, Thesaurus Temporum, P. ii, p. 34—57,) betrays his
      prejudice and passion: in Graeciam debacchantem ...Zenonis
      munificentia pene pacatus...beneficiis nunquam satiatus, &c.]

      1211 (return) [ Gibbon has omitted much of the complicated
      intrigues of the Byzantine court with the two Theodorics. The
      weak emperor attempted to play them one against the other, and
      was himself in turn insulted, and the empire ravaged, by both.
      The details of the successive alliance and revolt, of hostility
      and of union, between the two Gothic chieftains, to dictate terms
      to the emperor, may be found in Malchus.—M.]

      In every state of his fortune, the prudence and firmness of
      Theodoric were equally conspicuous; whether he threatened
      Constantinople at the head of the confederate Goths, or retreated
      with a faithful band to the mountains and sea-coast of Epirus. At
      length the accidental death of the son of Triarius 13 destroyed
      the balance which the Romans had been so anxious to preserve, the
      whole nation acknowledged the supremacy of the Amali, and the
      Byzantine court subscribed an ignominious and oppressive treaty.
      14 The senate had already declared, that it was necessary to
      choose a party among the Goths, since the public was unequal to
      the support of their united forces; a subsidy of two thousand
      pounds of gold, with the ample pay of thirteen thousand men, were
      required for the least considerable of their armies; 15 and the
      Isaurians, who guarded not the empire but the emperor, enjoyed,
      besides the privilege of rapine, an annual pension of five
      thousand pounds. The sagacious mind of Theodoric soon perceived
      that he was odious to the Romans, and suspected by the
      Barbarians: he understood the popular murmur, that his subjects
      were exposed in their frozen huts to intolerable hardships, while
      their king was dissolved in the luxury of Greece, and he
      prevented the painful alternative of encountering the Goths, as
      the champion, or of leading them to the field, as the enemy, of
      Zeno. Embracing an enterprise worthy of his courage and ambition,
      Theodoric addressed the emperor in the following words: “Although
      your servant is maintained in affluence by your liberality,
      graciously listen to the wishes of my heart! Italy, the
      inheritance of your predecessors, and Rome itself, the head and
      mistress of the world, now fluctuate under the violence and
      oppression of Odoacer the mercenary. Direct me, with my national
      troops, to march against the tyrant. If I fall, you will be
      relieved from an expensive and troublesome friend: if, with the
      divine permission, I succeed, I shall govern in your name, and to
      your glory, the Roman senate, and the part of the republic
      delivered from slavery by my victorious arms.” The proposal of
      Theodoric was accepted, and perhaps had been suggested, by the
      Byzantine court. But the forms of the commission, or grant,
      appear to have been expressed with a prudent ambiguity, which
      might be explained by the event; and it was left doubtful,
      whether the conqueror of Italy should reign as the lieutenant,
      the vassal, or the ally, of the emperor of the East. [16

      13 (return) [ As he was riding in his own camp, an unruly horse
      threw him against the point of a spear which hung before a tent,
      or was fixed on a wagon, (Marcellin. in Chron. Evagrius, l. iii.
      c. 25.)]

      14 (return) [ See Malchus (p. 91) and Evagrius, (l. iii. c. 35.)]

      15 (return) [ Malchus, p. 85. In a single action, which was
      decided by the skill and discipline of Sabinian, Theodoric could
      lose 5000 men.] [Footnote 16: Jornandes (c. 57, p. 696, 697) has
      abridged the great history of Cassiodorus. See, compare, and
      reconcile Procopius, (Gothic. l. i. c. i.,) the Valesian
      Fragment, (p. 718,) Theophanes, (p. 113,) and Marcellinus, (in
      Chron.)]

      The reputation both of the leader and of the war diffused a
      universal ardor; the Walamirs were multiplied by the Gothic
      swarms already engaged in the service, or seated in the
      provinces, of the empire; and each bold Barbarian, who had heard
      of the wealth and beauty of Italy, was impatient to seek, through
      the most perilous adventures, the possession of such enchanting
      objects. The march of Theodoric must be considered as the
      emigration of an entire people; the wives and children of the
      Goths, their aged parents, and most precious effects, were
      carefully transported; and some idea may be formed of the heavy
      baggage that now followed the camp, by the loss of two thousand
      wagons, which had been sustained in a single action in the war of
      Epirus. For their subsistence, the Goths depended on the
      magazines of corn which was ground in portable mills by the hands
      of their women; on the milk and flesh of their flocks and herds;
      on the casual produce of the chase, and upon the contributions
      which they might impose on all who should presume to dispute the
      passage, or to refuse their friendly assistance. Notwithstanding
      these precautions, they were exposed to the danger, and almost to
      the distress, of famine, in a march of seven hundred miles, which
      had been undertaken in the depth of a rigorous winter. Since the
      fall of the Roman power, Dacia and Pannonia no longer exhibited
      the rich prospect of populous cities, well-cultivated fields, and
      convenient highways: the reign of barbarism and desolation was
      restored, and the tribes of Bulgarians, Gepidae, and Sarmatians,
      who had occupied the vacant province, were prompted by their
      native fierceness, or the solicitations of Odoacer, to resist the
      progress of his enemy. In many obscure though bloody battles,
      Theodoric fought and vanquished; till at length, surmounting
      every obstacle by skilful conduct and persevering courage, he
      descended from the Julian Alps, and displayed his invincible
      banners on the confines of Italy. 17

      17 (return) [ Theodoric’s march is supplied and illustrated by
      Ennodius, (p. 1598—1602,) when the bombast of the oration is
      translated into the language of common sense.]

      Odoacer, a rival not unworthy of his arms, had already occupied
      the advantageous and well-known post of the River Sontius, near
      the ruins of Aquileia, at the head of a powerful host, whose
      independent kings 18 or leaders disdained the duties of
      subordination and the prudence of delays. No sooner had Theodoric
      gained a short repose and refreshment to his wearied cavalry,
      than he boldly attacked the fortifications of the enemy; the
      Ostrogoths showed more ardor to acquire, than the mercenaries to
      defend, the lands of Italy; and the reward of the first victory
      was the possession of the Venetian province as far as the walls
      of Verona. In the neighborhood of that city, on the steep banks
      of the rapid Adige, he was opposed by a new army, reenforced in
      its numbers, and not impaired in its courage: the contest was
      more obstinate, but the event was still more decisive; Odoacer
      fled to Ravenna, Theodoric advanced to Milan, and the vanquished
      troops saluted their conqueror with loud acclamations of respect
      and fidelity. But their want either of constancy or of faith soon
      exposed him to the most imminent danger; his vanguard, with
      several Gothic counts, which had been rashly intrusted to a
      deserter, was betrayed and destroyed near Faenza by his double
      treachery; Odoacer again appeared master of the field, and the
      invader, strongly intrenched in his camp of Pavia, was reduced to
      solicit the aid of a kindred nation, the Visigoths of Gaul. In
      the course of this History, the most voracious appetite for war
      will be abundantly satiated; nor can I much lament that our dark
      and imperfect materials do not afford a more ample narrative of
      the distress of Italy, and of the fierce conflict, which was
      finally decided by the abilities, experience, and valor of the
      Gothic king. Immediately before the battle of Verona, he visited
      the tent of his mother 19 and sister, and requested, that on a
      day, the most illustrious festival of his life, they would adorn
      him with the rich garments which they had worked with their own
      hands. “Our glory,” said he, “is mutual and inseparable. You are
      known to the world as the mother of Theodoric; and it becomes me
      to prove, that I am the genuine offspring of those heroes from
      whom I claim my descent.” The wife or concubine of Theodemir was
      inspired with the spirit of the German matrons, who esteemed
      their sons’ honor far above their safety; and it is reported,
      that in a desperate action, when Theodoric himself was hurried
      along by the torrent of a flying crowd, she boldly met them at
      the entrance of the camp, and, by her generous reproaches, drove
      them back on the swords of the enemy. 20

      recess. * Note: The authority of Sigonius would scarcely have
      weighed with Gibboa except for an indecent anecdote. I have a
      recollection of a similar story in some of the Italian wars.—M.]

      From the Alps to the extremity of Calabria, Theodoric reigned by
      the right of conquest; the Vandal ambassadors surrendered the
      Island of Sicily, as a lawful appendage of his kingdom; and he
      was accepted as the deliverer of Rome by the senate and people,
      who had shut their gates against the flying usurper. 21 Ravenna
      alone, secure in the fortifications of art and nature, still
      sustained a siege of almost three years; and the daring sallies
      of Odoacer carried slaughter and dismay into the Gothic camp. At
      length, destitute of provisions and hopeless of relief, that
      unfortunate monarch yielded to the groans of his subjects and the
      clamors of his soldiers. A treaty of peace was negotiated by the
      bishop of Ravenna; the Ostrogoths were admitted into the city,
      and the hostile kings consented, under the sanction of an oath,
      to rule with equal and undivided authority the provinces of
      Italy. The event of such an agreement may be easily foreseen.
      After some days had been devoted to the semblance of joy and
      friendship, Odoacer, in the midst of a solemn banquet, was
      stabbed by the hand, or at least by the command, of his rival.
      Secret and effectual orders had been previously despatched; the
      faithless and rapacious mercenaries, at the same moment, and
      without resistance, were universally massacred; and the royalty
      of Theodoric was proclaimed by the Goths, with the tardy,
      reluctant, ambiguous consent of the emperor of the East. The
      design of a conspiracy was imputed, according to the usual forms,
      to the prostrate tyrant; but his innocence, and the guilt of his
      conqueror, 22 are sufficiently proved by the advantageous treaty
      which force would not sincerely have granted, nor weakness have
      rashly infringed. The jealousy of power, and the mischiefs of
      discord, may suggest a more decent apology, and a sentence less
      rigorous may be pronounced against a crime which was necessary to
      introduce into Italy a generation of public felicity. The living
      author of this felicity was audaciously praised in his own
      presence by sacred and profane orators; 23 but history (in his
      time she was mute and inglorious) has not left any just
      representation of the events which displayed, or of the defects
      which clouded, the virtues of Theodoric. 24 One record of his
      fame, the volume of public epistles composed by Cassiodorus in
      the royal name, is still extant, and has obtained more implicit
      credit than it seems to deserve. 25 They exhibit the forms,
      rather than the substance, of his government; and we should
      vainly search for the pure and spontaneous sentiments of the
      Barbarian amidst the declamation and learning of a sophist, the
      wishes of a Roman senator, the precedents of office, and the
      vague professions, which, in every court, and on every occasion,
      compose the language of discreet ministers. The reputation of
      Theodoric may repose with more confidence on the visible peace
      and prosperity of a reign of thirty-three years; the unanimous
      esteem of his own times, and the memory of his wisdom and
      courage, his justice and humanity, which was deeply impressed on
      the minds of the Goths and Italians.

      is never simple, and seldom perspicuous]

      The partition of the lands of Italy, of which Theodoric assigned
      the third part to his soldiers, is honorably arraigned as the
      sole injustice of his life. 2511 And even this act may be fairly
      justified by the example of Odoacer, the rights of conquest, the
      true interest of the Italians, and the sacred duty of subsisting
      a whole people, who, on the faith of his promises, had
      transported themselves into a distant land. 26 Under the reign of
      Theodoric, and in the happy climate of Italy, the Goths soon
      multiplied to a formidable host of two hundred thousand men, 27
      and the whole amount of their families may be computed by the
      ordinary addition of women and children. Their invasion of
      property, a part of which must have been already vacant, was
      disguised by the generous but improper name of hospitality; these
      unwelcome guests were irregularly dispersed over the face of
      Italy, and the lot of each Barbarian was adequate to his birth
      and office, the number of his followers, and the rustic wealth
      which he possessed in slaves and cattle. The distinction of noble
      and plebeian were acknowledged; 28 but the lands of every freeman
      were exempt from taxes, 2811 and he enjoyed the inestimable
      privilege of being subject only to the laws of his country. 29
      Fashion, and even convenience, soon persuaded the conquerors to
      assume the more elegant dress of the natives, but they still
      persisted in the use of their mother-tongue; and their contempt
      for the Latin schools was applauded by Theodoric himself, who
      gratified their prejudices, or his own, by declaring, that the
      child who had trembled at a rod, would never dare to look upon a
      sword. 30 Distress might sometimes provoke the indigent Roman to
      assume the ferocious manners which were insensibly relinquished
      by the rich and luxurious Barbarian; 31 but these mutual
      conversions were not encouraged by the policy of a monarch who
      perpetuated the separation of the Italians and Goths; reserving
      the former for the arts of peace, and the latter for the service
      of war. To accomplish this design, he studied to protect his
      industrious subjects, and to moderate the violence, without
      enervating the valor, of his soldiers, who were maintained for
      the public defence. They held their lands and benefices as a
      military stipend: at the sound of the trumpet, they were prepared
      to march under the conduct of their provincial officers; and the
      whole extent of Italy was distributed into the several quarters
      of a well-regulated camp. The service of the palace and of the
      frontiers was performed by choice or by rotation; and each
      extraordinary fatigue was recompensed by an increase of pay and
      occasional donatives. Theodoric had convinced his brave
      companions, that empire must be acquired and defended by the same
      arts. After his example, they strove to excel in the use, not
      only of the lance and sword, the instruments of their victories,
      but of the missile weapons, which they were too much inclined to
      neglect; and the lively image of war was displayed in the daily
      exercise and annual reviews of the Gothic cavalry. A firm though
      gentle discipline imposed the habits of modesty, obedience, and
      temperance; and the Goths were instructed to spare the people, to
      reverence the laws, to understand the duties of civil society,
      and to disclaim the barbarous license of judicial combat and
      private revenge. 32

      Chapter XXXIX: Gothic Kingdom Of Italy.—Part II.

      Among the Barbarians of the West, the victory of Theodoric had
      spread a general alarm. But as soon as it appeared that he was
      satisfied with conquest and desirous of peace, terror was changed
      into respect, and they submitted to a powerful mediation, which
      was uniformly employed for the best purposes of reconciling their
      quarrels and civilizing their manners. 33 The ambassadors who
      resorted to Ravenna from the most distant countries of Europe,
      admired his wisdom, magnificence, 34 and courtesy; and if he
      sometimes accepted either slaves or arms, white horses or strange
      animals, the gift of a sun-dial, a water-clock, or a musician,
      admonished even the princes of Gaul of the superior art and
      industry of his Italian subjects. His domestic alliances, 35 a
      wife, two daughters, a sister, and a niece, united the family of
      Theodoric with the kings of the Franks, the Burgundians, the
      Visigoths, the Vandals, and the Thuringians, and contributed to
      maintain the harmony, or at least the balance, of the great
      republic of the West. 36 It is difficult in the dark forests of
      Germany and Poland to pursue the emigrations of the Heruli, a
      fierce people who disdained the use of armor, and who condemned
      their widows and aged parents not to survive the loss of their
      husbands, or the decay of their strength. 37 The king of these
      savage warriors solicited the friendship of Theodoric, and was
      elevated to the rank of his son, according to the barbaric rites
      of a military adoption. 38 From the shores of the Baltic, the
      Aestians or Livonians laid their offerings of native amber 39 at
      the feet of a prince, whose fame had excited them to undertake an
      unknown and dangerous journey of fifteen hundred miles. With the
      country 40 from whence the Gothic nation derived their origin, he
      maintained a frequent and friendly correspondence: the Italians
      were clothed in the rich sables 41 of Sweden; and one of its
      sovereigns, after a voluntary or reluctant abdication, found a
      hospitable retreat in the palace of Ravenna. He had reigned over
      one of the thirteen populous tribes who cultivated a small
      portion of the great island or peninsula of Scandinavia, to which
      the vague appellation of Thule has been sometimes applied. That
      northern region was peopled, or had been explored, as high as the
      sixty-eighth degree of latitude, where the natives of the polar
      circle enjoy and lose the presence of the sun at each summer and
      winter solstice during an equal period of forty days. 42 The long
      night of his absence or death was the mournful season of distress
      and anxiety, till the messengers, who had been sent to the
      mountain tops, descried the first rays of returning light, and
      proclaimed to the plain below the festival of his resurrection.

      37 (return) [ The curious reader may contemplate the Heruli of
      Procopius, (Goth. l. ii. c. 14,) and the patient reader may
      plunge into the dark and minute researches of M. de Buat, (Hist.
      des Peuples Anciens, tom. ix. p. 348—396. * Note: Compare Manso,
      Ost Gothische Reich. Beylage, vi. Malte-Brun brings them from
      Scandinavia: their names, the only remains of their language, are
      Gothic. “They fought almost naked, like the Icelandic Berserkirs
      their bravery was like madness: few in number, they were mostly
      of royal blood. What ferocity, what unrestrained license, sullied
      their victories! The Goth respects the church, the priests, the
      senate; the Heruli mangle all in a general massacre: there is no
      pity for age, no refuge for chastity. Among themselves there is
      the same ferocity: the sick and the aged are put to death. at
      their own request, during a solemn festival; the widow ends her
      days by hanging herself upon the tree which shadows her husband’s
      tomb. All these circumstances, so striking to a mind familiar
      with Scandinavian history, lead us to discover among the Heruli
      not so much a nation as a confederacy of princes and nobles,
      bound by an oath to live and die together with their arms in
      their hands. Their name, sometimes written Heruli or Eruli.
      sometimes Aeruli, signified, according to an ancient author,
      (Isid. Hispal. in gloss. p. 24, ad calc. Lex. Philolog. Martini,

      Scandinavian word iarl or earl, than with any of those numerous
      derivations proposed by etymologists.” Malte-Brun, vol. i. p.
      400, (edit. 1831.) Of all the Barbarians who threw themselves on
      the ruins of the Roman empire, it is most difficult to trace the
      origin of the Heruli. They seem never to have been very powerful
      as a nation, and branches of them are found in countries very
      remote from each other. In my opinion they belong to the Gothic
      race, and have a close affinity with the Scyrri or Hirri. They
      were, possibly, a division of that nation. They are often mingled
      and confounded with the Alani. Though brave and formidable. they
      were never numerous. nor did they found any state.—St. Martin,
      vol. vi. p. 375.—M. Schafarck considers them descendants of the

      The life of Theodoric represents the rare and meritorious example
      of a Barbarian, who sheathed his sword in the pride of victory
      and the vigor of his age. A reign of three and thirty years was
      consecrated to the duties of civil government, and the
      hostilities, in which he was sometimes involved, were speedily
      terminated by the conduct of his lieutenants, the discipline of
      his troops, the arms of his allies, and even by the terror of his
      name. He reduced, under a strong and regular government, the
      unprofitable countries of Rhaetia, Noricum, Dalmatia, and
      Pannonia, from the source of the Danube and the territory of the
      Bavarians, 44 to the petty kingdom erected by the Gepidae on the
      ruins of Sirmium. His prudence could not safely intrust the
      bulwark of Italy to such feeble and turbulent neighbors; and his
      justice might claim the lands which they oppressed, either as a
      part of his kingdom, or as the inheritance of his father. The
      greatness of a servant, who was named perfidious because he was
      successful, awakened the jealousy of the emperor Anastasius; and
      a war was kindled on the Dacian frontier, by the protection which
      the Gothic king, in the vicissitude of human affairs, had granted
      to one of the descendants of Attila. Sabinian, a general
      illustrious by his own and father’s merit, advanced at the head
      of ten thousand Romans; and the provisions and arms, which filled
      a long train of wagons, were distributed to the fiercest of the
      Bulgarian tribes. But in the fields of Margus, the eastern powers
      were defeated by the inferior forces of the Goths and Huns; the
      flower and even the hope of the Roman armies was irretrievably
      destroyed; and such was the temperance with which Theodoric had
      inspired his victorious troops, that, as their leader had not
      given the signal of pillage, the rich spoils of the enemy lay
      untouched at their feet. 45 Exasperated by this disgrace, the
      Byzantine court despatched two hundred ships and eight thousand
      men to plunder the sea-coast of Calabria and Apulia: they
      assaulted the ancient city of Tarentum, interrupted the trade and
      agriculture of a happy country, and sailed back to the
      Hellespont, proud of their piratical victory over a people whom
      they still presumed to consider as their Roman brethren. 46 Their
      retreat was possibly hastened by the activity of Theodoric; Italy
      was covered by a fleet of a thousand light vessels, 47 which he
      constructed with incredible despatch; and his firm moderation was
      soon rewarded by a solid and honorable peace. He maintained, with
      a powerful hand, the balance of the West, till it was at length
      overthrown by the ambition of Clovis; and although unable to
      assist his rash and unfortunate kinsman, the king of the
      Visigoths, he saved the remains of his family and people, and
      checked the Franks in the midst of their victorious career. I am
      not desirous to prolong or repeat 48 this narrative of military
      events, the least interesting of the reign of Theodoric; and
      shall be content to add, that the Alemanni were protected, 49
      that an inroad of the Burgundians was severely chastised, and
      that the conquest of Arles and Marseilles opened a free
      communication with the Visigoths, who revered him as their
      national protector, and as the guardian of his grandchild, the
      infant son of Alaric. Under this respectable character, the king
      of Italy restored the praetorian praefecture of the Gauls,
      reformed some abuses in the civil government of Spain, and
      accepted the annual tribute and apparent submission of its
      military governor, who wisely refused to trust his person in the
      palace of Ravenna. 50 The Gothic sovereignty was established from
      Sicily to the Danube, from Sirmium or Belgrade to the Atlantic
      Ocean; and the Greeks themselves have acknowledged that Theodoric
      reigned over the fairest portion of the Western empire. 51

      The union of the Goths and Romans might have fixed for ages the
      transient happiness of Italy; and the first of nations, a new
      people of free subjects and enlightened soldiers, might have
      gradually arisen from the mutual emulation of their respective
      virtues. But the sublime merit of guiding or seconding such a
      revolution was not reserved for the reign of Theodoric: he wanted
      either the genius or the opportunities of a legislator; 52 and
      while he indulged the Goths in the enjoyment of rude liberty, he
      servilely copied the institutions, and even the abuses, of the
      political system which had been framed by Constantine and his
      successors. From a tender regard to the expiring prejudices of
      Rome, the Barbarian declined the name, the purple, and the
      diadem, of the emperors; but he assumed, under the hereditary
      title of king, the whole substance and plenitude of Imperial
      prerogative. 53 His addresses to the eastern throne were
      respectful and ambiguous: he celebrated, in pompous style, the
      harmony of the two republics, applauded his own government as the
      perfect similitude of a sole and undivided empire, and claimed
      above the kings of the earth the same preeminence which he
      modestly allowed to the person or rank of Anastasius. The
      alliance of the East and West was annually declared by the
      unanimous choice of two consuls; but it should seem that the
      Italian candidate who was named by Theodoric accepted a formal
      confirmation from the sovereign of Constantinople. 54 The Gothic
      palace of Ravenna reflected the image of the court of Theodosius
      or Valentinian. The Praetorian praefect, the praefect of Rome,
      the quaestor, the master of the offices, with the public and
      patrimonial treasurers, 5411 whose functions are painted in gaudy
      colors by the rhetoric of Cassiodorus, still continued to act as
      the ministers of state. And the subordinate care of justice and
      the revenue was delegated to seven consulars, three correctors,
      and five presidents, who governed the fifteen regions of Italy
      according to the principles, and even the forms, of Roman
      jurisprudence. 55 The violence of the conquerors was abated or
      eluded by the slow artifice of judicial proceedings; the civil
      administration, with its honors and emoluments, was confined to
      the Italians; and the people still preserved their dress and
      language, their laws and customs, their personal freedom, and two
      thirds of their landed property. 5511 It had been the object of
      Augustus to conceal the introduction of monarchy; it was the
      policy of Theodoric to disguise the reign of a Barbarian. 56 If
      his subjects were sometimes awakened from this pleasing vision of
      a Roman government, they derived more substantial comfort from
      the character of a Gothic prince, who had penetration to discern,
      and firmness to pursue, his own and the public interest.
      Theodoric loved the virtues which he possessed, and the talents
      of which he was destitute. Liberius was promoted to the office of
      Praetorian praefect for his unshaken fidelity to the unfortunate
      cause of Odoacer. The ministers of Theodoric, Cassiodorus, 57 and
      Boethius, have reflected on his reign the lustre of their genius
      and learning. More prudent or more fortunate than his colleague,
      Cassiodorus preserved his own esteem without forfeiting the royal
      favor; and after passing thirty years in the honors of the world,
      he was blessed with an equal term of repose in the devout and
      studious solitude of Squillace. 5711

      including mines, unclaimed estates, treasure-trove, and

      tax on certain branches of trade. 5. Grant of Monopolies. 6.

      commodities. 7. Portoria, customs Manso, 96, 111. Savigny (i.

      employed in the administration of Theodoric. The son was born in
      the year 479: his various epistles as quaestor, master of the
      offices, and Praetorian praefect, extend from 509 to 539, and he
      lived as a monk about thirty years, (Tiraboschi Storia della
      Letteratura Italiana, tom. iii. p. 7—24. Fabricius, Bibliot. Lat.

      5711 (return) [ Cassiodorus was of an ancient and honorable
      family; his grandfather had distinguished himself in the defence
      of Sicily against the ravages of Genseric; his father held a high
      rank at the court of Valentinian III., enjoyed the friendship of
      Aetius, and was one of the ambassadors sent to arrest the
      progress of Attila. Cassiodorus himself was first the treasurer
      of the private expenditure to Odoacer, afterwards “count of the
      sacred largesses.” Yielding with the rest of the Romans to the
      dominion of Theodoric, he was instrumental in the peaceable
      submission of Sicily; was successively governor of his native
      provinces of Bruttium and Lucania, quaestor, magister, palatii,
      Praetorian praefect, patrician, consul, and private secretary,
      and, in fact, first minister of the king. He was five times
      Praetorian praefect under different sovereigns, the last time in
      the reign of Vitiges. This is the theory of Manso, which is not
      unencumbered with difficulties. M. Buat had supposed that it was
      the father of Cassiodorus who held the office first named.
      Compare Manso, p. 85, &c., and Beylage, vii. It certainly appears
      improbable that Cassiodorus should have been count of the sacred
      largesses at twenty years old.—M.]

      As the patron of the republic, it was the interest and duty of
      the Gothic king to cultivate the affections of the senate 58 and
      people. The nobles of Rome were flattered by sonorous epithets
      and formal professions of respect, which had been more justly
      applied to the merit and authority of their ancestors. The people
      enjoyed, without fear or danger, the three blessings of a
      capital, order, plenty, and public amusements. A visible
      diminution of their numbers may be found even in the measure of
      liberality; 59 yet Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily, poured their
      tribute of corn into the granaries of Rome an allowance of bread
      and meat was distributed to the indigent citizens; and every
      office was deemed honorable which was consecrated to the care of
      their health and happiness. The public games, such as the Greek
      ambassador might politely applaud, exhibited a faint and feeble
      copy of the magnificence of the Caesars: yet the musical, the
      gymnastic, and the pantomime arts, had not totally sunk in
      oblivion; the wild beasts of Africa still exercised in the
      amphitheatre the courage and dexterity of the hunters; and the
      indulgent Goth either patiently tolerated or gently restrained
      the blue and green factions, whose contests so often filled the
      circus with clamor and even with blood. 60 In the seventh year of
      his peaceful reign, Theodoric visited the old capital of the
      world; the senate and people advanced in solemn procession to
      salute a second Trajan, a new Valentinian; and he nobly supported
      that character by the assurance of a just and legal government,
      61 in a discourse which he was not afraid to pronounce in public,
      and to inscribe on a tablet of brass. Rome, in this august
      ceremony, shot a last ray of declining glory; and a saint, the
      spectator of this pompous scene, could only hope, in his pious
      fancy, that it was excelled by the celestial splendor of the new
      Jerusalem. 62 During a residence of six months, the fame, the
      person, and the courteous demeanor of the Gothic king, excited
      the admiration of the Romans, and he contemplated, with equal
      curiosity and surprise, the monuments that remained of their
      ancient greatness. He imprinted the footsteps of a conqueror on
      the Capitoline hill, and frankly confessed that each day he
      viewed with fresh wonder the forum of Trajan and his lofty
      column. The theatre of Pompey appeared, even in its decay, as a
      huge mountain artificially hollowed, and polished, and adorned by
      human industry; and he vaguely computed, that a river of gold
      must have been drained to erect the colossal amphitheatre of
      Titus. 63 From the mouths of fourteen aqueducts, a pure and
      copious stream was diffused into every part of the city; among
      these the Claudian water, which arose at the distance of
      thirty-eight miles in the Sabine mountains, was conveyed along a
      gentle though constant declivity of solid arches, till it
      descended on the summit of the Aventine hill. The long and
      spacious vaults which had been constructed for the purpose of
      common sewers, subsisted, after twelve centuries, in their
      pristine strength; and these subterraneous channels have been
      preferred to all the visible wonders of Rome. 64 The Gothic
      kings, so injuriously accused of the ruin of antiquity, were
      anxious to preserve the monuments of the nation whom they had
      subdued. 65 The royal edicts were framed to prevent the abuses,
      the neglect, or the depredations of the citizens themselves; and
      a professed architect, the annual sum of two hundred pounds of
      gold, twenty-five thousand tiles, and the receipt of customs from
      the Lucrine port, were assigned for the ordinary repairs of the
      walls and public edifices. A similar care was extended to the
      statues of metal or marble of men or animals. The spirit of the
      horses, which have given a modern name to the Quirinal, was
      applauded by the Barbarians; 66 the brazen elephants of the Via
      sacra were diligently restored; 67 the famous heifer of Myron
      deceived the cattle, as they were driven through the forum of
      peace; 68 and an officer was created to protect those works of
      art, which Theodoric considered as the noblest ornament of his
      kingdom.

      Chapter XXXIX: Gothic Kingdom Of Italy.—Part III.

      After the example of the last emperors, Theodoric preferred the
      residence of Ravenna, where he cultivated an orchard with his own
      hands. 69 As often as the peace of his kingdom was threatened
      (for it was never invaded) by the Barbarians, he removed his
      court to Verona 70 on the northern frontier, and the image of his
      palace, still extant on a coin, represents the oldest and most
      authentic model of Gothic architecture. These two capitals, as
      well as Pavia, Spoleto, Naples, and the rest of the Italian
      cities, acquired under his reign the useful or splendid
      decorations of churches, aqueducts, baths, porticos, and palaces.
      71 But the happiness of the subject was more truly conspicuous in
      the busy scene of labor and luxury, in the rapid increase and
      bold enjoyment of national wealth. From the shades of Tibur and
      Praeneste, the Roman senators still retired in the winter season
      to the warm sun, and salubrious springs of Baiae; and their
      villas, which advanced on solid moles into the Bay of Naples,
      commanded the various prospect of the sky, the earth, and the
      water. On the eastern side of the Adriatic, a new Campania was
      formed in the fair and fruitful province of Istria, which
      communicated with the palace of Ravenna by an easy navigation of
      one hundred miles. The rich productions of Lucania and the
      adjacent provinces were exchanged at the Marcilian fountain, in a
      populous fair annually dedicated to trade, intemperance, and
      superstition. In the solitude of Comum, which had once been
      animated by the mild genius of Pliny, a transparent basin above
      sixty miles in length still reflected the rural seats which
      encompassed the margin of the Larian lake; and the gradual ascent
      of the hills was covered by a triple plantation of olives, of
      vines, and of chestnut trees. 72 Agriculture revived under the
      shadow of peace, and the number of husbandmen was multiplied by
      the redemption of captives. 73 The iron mines of Dalmatia, a gold
      mine in Bruttium, were carefully explored, and the Pomptine
      marshes, as well as those of Spoleto, were drained and cultivated
      by private undertakers, whose distant reward must depend on the
      continuance of the public prosperity. 74 Whenever the seasons
      were less propitious, the doubtful precautions of forming
      magazines of corn, fixing the price, and prohibiting the
      exportation, attested at least the benevolence of the state; but
      such was the extraordinary plenty which an industrious people
      produced from a grateful soil, that a gallon of wine was
      sometimes sold in Italy for less than three farthings, and a
      quarter of wheat at about five shillings and sixpence. 75 A
      country possessed of so many valuable objects of exchange soon
      attracted the merchants of the world, whose beneficial traffic
      was encouraged and protected by the liberal spirit of Theodoric.
      The free intercourse of the provinces by land and water was
      restored and extended; the city gates were never shut either by
      day or by night; and the common saying, that a purse of gold
      might be safely left in the fields, was expressive of the
      conscious security of the inhabitants.

      A difference of religion is always pernicious, and often fatal,
      to the harmony of the prince and people: the Gothic conqueror had
      been educated in the profession of Arianism, and Italy was
      devoutly attached to the Nicene faith. But the persuasion of
      Theodoric was not infected by zeal; and he piously adhered to the
      heresy of his fathers, without condescending to balance the
      subtile arguments of theological metaphysics. Satisfied with the
      private toleration of his Arian sectaries, he justly conceived
      himself to be the guardian of the public worship, and his
      external reverence for a superstition which he despised, may have
      nourished in his mind the salutary indifference of a statesman or
      philosopher. The Catholics of his dominions acknowledged, perhaps
      with reluctance, the peace of the church; their clergy, according
      to the degrees of rank or merit, were honorably entertained in
      the palace of Theodoric; he esteemed the living sanctity of
      Caesarius 76 and Epiphanius, 77 the orthodox bishops of Arles and
      Pavia; and presented a decent offering on the tomb of St. Peter,
      without any scrupulous inquiry into the creed of the apostle. 78
      His favorite Goths, and even his mother, were permitted to retain
      or embrace the Athanasian faith, and his long reign could not
      afford the example of an Italian Catholic, who, either from
      choice or compulsion, had deviated into the religion of the
      conqueror. 79 The people, and the Barbarians themselves, were
      edified by the pomp and order of religious worship; the
      magistrates were instructed to defend the just immunities of
      ecclesiastical persons and possessions; the bishops held their
      synods, the metropolitans exercised their jurisdiction, and the
      privileges of sanctuary were maintained or moderated according to
      the spirit of the Roman jurisprudence. 80 With the protection,
      Theodoric assumed the legal supremacy, of the church; and his
      firm administration restored or extended some useful prerogatives
      which had been neglected by the feeble emperors of the West. He
      was not ignorant of the dignity and importance of the Roman
      pontiff, to whom the venerable name of Pope was now appropriated.
      The peace or the revolt of Italy might depend on the character of
      a wealthy and popular bishop, who claimed such ample dominion
      both in heaven and earth; who had been declared in a numerous
      synod to be pure from all sin, and exempt from all judgment. 81
      When the chair of St. Peter was disputed by Symmachus and
      Laurence, they appeared at his summons before the tribunal of an
      Arian monarch, and he confirmed the election of the most worthy
      or the most obsequious candidate. At the end of his life, in a
      moment of jealousy and resentment, he prevented the choice of the
      Romans, by nominating a pope in the palace of Ravenna. The danger
      and furious contests of a schism were mildly restrained, and the
      last decree of the senate was enacted to extinguish, if it were
      possible, the scandalous venality of the papal elections. 82

      confess, with an angry growl, this Gothic usurpation.]

      I have descanted with pleasure on the fortunate condition of
      Italy; but our fancy must not hastily conceive that the golden
      age of the poets, a race of men without vice or misery, was
      realized under the Gothic conquest. The fair prospect was
      sometimes overcast with clouds; the wisdom of Theodoric might be
      deceived, his power might be resisted and the declining age of
      the monarch was sullied with popular hatred and patrician blood.
      In the first insolence of victory, he had been tempted to deprive
      the whole party of Odoacer of the civil and even the natural
      rights of society; 83 a tax unseasonably imposed after the
      calamities of war, would have crushed the rising agriculture of
      Liguria; a rigid preemption of corn, which was intended for the
      public relief, must have aggravated the distress of Campania.
      These dangerous projects were defeated by the virtue and
      eloquence of Epiphanius and Boethius, who, in the presence of
      Theodoric himself, successfully pleaded the cause of the people:
      84 but if the royal ear was open to the voice of truth, a saint
      and a philosopher are not always to be found at the ear of kings.

      The privileges of rank, or office, or favor, were too frequently
      abused by Italian fraud and Gothic violence, and the avarice of
      the king’s nephew was publicly exposed, at first by the
      usurpation, and afterwards by the restitution of the estates
      which he had unjustly extorted from his Tuscan neighbors. Two
      hundred thousand Barbarians, formidable even to their master,
      were seated in the heart of Italy; they indignantly supported the
      restraints of peace and discipline; the disorders of their march
      were always felt and sometimes compensated; and where it was
      dangerous to punish, it might be prudent to dissemble, the
      sallies of their native fierceness. When the indulgence of
      Theodoric had remitted two thirds of the Ligurian tribute, he
      condescended to explain the difficulties of his situation, and to
      lament the heavy though inevitable burdens which he imposed on
      his subjects for their own defence. 85 These ungrateful subjects
      could never be cordially reconciled to the origin, the religion,
      or even the virtues of the Gothic conqueror; past calamities were
      forgotten, and the sense or suspicion of injuries was rendered
      still more exquisite by the present felicity of the times.

      83 (return) [ He disabled them—alicentia testandi; and all Italy
      mourned—lamentabili justitio. I wish to believe, that these
      penalties were enacted against the rebels who had violated their
      oath of allegiance; but the testimony of Ennodius (p. 1675-1678)
      is the more weighty, as he lived and died under the reign of
      Theodoric.]

      85 (return) [ Immanium expensarum pondus...pro ipsorum salute,
      &c.; yet these are no more than words.]

      Even the religious toleration which Theodoric had the glory of
      introducing into the Christian world, was painful and offensive
      to the orthodox zeal of the Italians. They respected the armed
      heresy of the Goths; but their pious rage was safely pointed
      against the rich and defenceless Jews, who had formed their
      establishments at Naples, Rome, Ravenna, Milan, and Genoa, for
      the benefit of trade, and under the sanction of the laws. 86
      Their persons were insulted, their effects were pillaged, and
      their synagogues were burned by the mad populace of Ravenna and
      Rome, inflamed, as it should seem, by the most frivolous or
      extravagant pretences. The government which could neglect, would
      have deserved such an outrage. A legal inquiry was instantly
      directed; and as the authors of the tumult had escaped in the
      crowd, the whole community was condemned to repair the damage;
      and the obstinate bigots, who refused their contributions, were
      whipped through the streets by the hand of the executioner. 8611
      This simple act of justice exasperated the discontent of the
      Catholics, who applauded the merit and patience of these holy
      confessors. Three hundred pulpits deplored the persecution of the
      church; and if the chapel of St. Stephen at Verona was demolished
      by the command of Theodoric, it is probable that some miracle
      hostile to his name and dignity had been performed on that sacred
      theatre. At the close of a glorious life, the king of Italy
      discovered that he had excited the hatred of a people whose
      happiness he had so assiduously labored to promote; and his mind
      was soured by indignation, jealousy, and the bitterness of
      unrequited love. The Gothic conqueror condescended to disarm the
      unwarlike natives of Italy, interdicting all weapons of offence,
      and excepting only a small knife for domestic use. The deliverer
      of Rome was accused of conspiring with the vilest informers
      against the lives of senators whom he suspected of a secret and
      treasonable correspondence with the Byzantine court. 87 After the
      death of Anastasius, the diadem had been placed on the head of a
      feeble old man; but the powers of government were assumed by his
      nephew Justinian, who already meditated the extirpation of
      heresy, and the conquest of Italy and Africa. A rigorous law,
      which was published at Constantinople, to reduce the Arians by
      the dread of punishment within the pale of the church, awakened
      the just resentment of Theodoric, who claimed for his distressed
      brethren of the East the same indulgence which he had so long
      granted to the Catholics of his dominions. 8711 At his stern
      command, the Roman pontiff, with four illustrious senators,
      embarked on an embassy, of which he must have alike dreaded the
      failure or the success. The singular veneration shown to the
      first pope who had visited Constantinople was punished as a crime
      by his jealous monarch; the artful or peremptory refusal of the
      Byzantine court might excuse an equal, and would provoke a
      larger, measure of retaliation; and a mandate was prepared in
      Italy, to prohibit, after a stated day, the exercise of the
      Catholic worship. By the bigotry of his subjects and enemies, the
      most tolerant of princes was driven to the brink of persecution;
      and the life of Theodoric was too long, since he lived to condemn
      the virtue of Boethius and Symmachus. 88

      sovereigns is confined to external government; that they have no
      right of punishment but over those who disturb the public peace,
      of which they are the guardians; that the most dangerous heresy
      is that of a sovereign who separates from himself a part of his
      subjects because they believe not according to his belief.

      The senator Boethius 89 is the last of the Romans whom Cato or
      Tully could have acknowledged for their countryman. As a wealthy
      orphan, he inherited the patrimony and honors of the Anician
      family, a name ambitiously assumed by the kings and emperors of
      the age; and the appellation of Manlius asserted his genuine or
      fabulous descent from a race of consuls and dictators, who had
      repulsed the Gauls from the Capitol, and sacrificed their sons to
      the discipline of the republic. In the youth of Boethius the
      studies of Rome were not totally abandoned; a Virgil 90 is now
      extant, corrected by the hand of a consul; and the professors of
      grammar, rhetoric, and jurisprudence, were maintained in their
      privileges and pensions by the liberality of the Goths. But the
      erudition of the Latin language was insufficient to satiate his
      ardent curiosity: and Boethius is said to have employed eighteen
      laborious years in the schools of Athens, 91 which were supported
      by the zeal, the learning, and the diligence of Proclus and his
      disciples. The reason and piety of their Roman pupil were
      fortunately saved from the contagion of mystery and magic, which
      polluted the groves of the academy; but he imbibed the spirit,
      and imitated the method, of his dead and living masters, who
      attempted to reconcile the strong and subtile sense of Aristotle
      with the devout contemplation and sublime fancy of Plato. After
      his return to Rome, and his marriage with the daughter of his
      friend, the patrician Symmachus, Boethius still continued, in a
      palace of ivory and marble, to prosecute the same studies. 92 The
      church was edified by his profound defence of the orthodox creed
      against the Arian, the Eutychian, and the Nestorian heresies; and
      the Catholic unity was explained or exposed in a formal treatise
      by the indifference of three distinct though consubstantial
      persons. For the benefit of his Latin readers, his genius
      submitted to teach the first elements of the arts and sciences of
      Greece. The geometry of Euclid, the music of Pythagoras, the
      arithmetic of Nicomachus, the mechanics of Archimedes, the
      astronomy of Ptolemy, the theology of Plato, and the logic of
      Aristotle, with the commentary of Porphyry, were translated and
      illustrated by the indefatigable pen of the Roman senator. And he
      alone was esteemed capable of describing the wonders of art, a
      sun-dial, a water-clock, or a sphere which represented the
      motions of the planets. From these abstruse speculations,
      Boethius stooped, or, to speak more truly, he rose to the social
      duties of public and private life: the indigent were relieved by
      his liberality; and his eloquence, which flattery might compare
      to the voice of Demosthenes or Cicero, was uniformly exerted in
      the cause of innocence and humanity. Such conspicuous merit was
      felt and rewarded by a discerning prince: the dignity of Boethius
      was adorned with the titles of consul and patrician, and his
      talents were usefully employed in the important station of master
      of the offices. Notwithstanding the equal claims of the East and
      West, his two sons were created, in their tender youth, the
      consuls of the same year. 93 On the memorable day of their
      inauguration, they proceeded in solemn pomp from their palace to
      the forum amidst the applause of the senate and people; and their
      joyful father, the true consul of Rome, after pronouncing an
      oration in the praise of his royal benefactor, distributed a
      triumphal largess in the games of the circus. Prosperous in his
      fame and fortunes, in his public honors and private alliances, in
      the cultivation of science and the consciousness of virtue,
      Boethius might have been styled happy, if that precarious epithet
      could be safely applied before the last term of the life of man.

      time, might be insensible to the common allurements of ambition,
      the thirst of gold and employment. And some credit may be due to
      the asseveration of Boethius, that he had reluctantly obeyed the
      divine Plato, who enjoins every virtuous citizen to rescue the
      state from the usurpation of vice and ignorance. For the
      integrity of his public conduct he appeals to the memory of his
      country. His authority had restrained the pride and oppression of
      the royal officers, and his eloquence had delivered Paulianus
      from the dogs of the palace. He had always pitied, and often
      relieved, the distress of the provincials, whose fortunes were
      exhausted by public and private rapine; and Boethius alone had
      courage to oppose the tyranny of the Barbarians, elated by
      conquest, excited by avarice, and, as he complains, encouraged by
      impunity. In these honorable contests his spirit soared above the
      consideration of danger, and perhaps of prudence; and we may
      learn from the example of Cato, that a character of pure and
      inflexible virtue is the most apt to be misled by prejudice, to
      be heated by enthusiasm, and to confound private enmities with
      public justice. The disciple of Plato might exaggerate the
      infirmities of nature, and the imperfections of society; and the
      mildest form of a Gothic kingdom, even the weight of allegiance
      and gratitude, must be insupportable to the free spirit of a
      Roman patriot. But the favor and fidelity of Boethius declined in
      just proportion with the public happiness; and an unworthy
      colleague was imposed to divide and control the power of the
      master of the offices. In the last gloomy season of Theodoric, he
      indignantly felt that he was a slave; but as his master had only
      power over his life, he stood without arms and without fear
      against the face of an angry Barbarian, who had been provoked to
      believe that the safety of the senate was incompatible with his
      own. The senator Albinus was accused and already convicted on the
      presumption of hoping, as it was said, the liberty of Rome. “If
      Albinus be criminal,” exclaimed the orator, “the senate and
      myself are all guilty of the same crime. If we are innocent,
      Albinus is equally entitled to the protection of the laws.” These
      laws might not have punished the simple and barren wish of an
      unattainable blessing; but they would have shown less indulgence
      to the rash confession of Boethius, that, had he known of a
      conspiracy, the tyrant never should. 94 The advocate of Albinus
      was soon involved in the danger and perhaps the guilt of his
      client; their signature (which they denied as a forgery) was
      affixed to the original address, inviting the emperor to deliver
      Italy from the Goths; and three witnesses of honorable rank,
      perhaps of infamous reputation, attested the treasonable designs
      of the Roman patrician. 95 Yet his innocence must be presumed,
      since he was deprived by Theodoric of the means of justification,
      and rigorously confined in the tower of Pavia, while the senate,
      at the distance of five hundred miles, pronounced a sentence of
      confiscation and death against the most illustrious of its
      members. At the command of the Barbarians, the occult science of
      a philosopher was stigmatized with the names of sacrilege and
      magic. 96 A devout and dutiful attachment to the senate was
      condemned as criminal by the trembling voices of the senators
      themselves; and their ingratitude deserved the wish or prediction
      of Boethius, that, after him, none should be found guilty of the
      same offence. 97

      94 (return) [ Si ego scissem tu nescisses. Beothius adopts this
      answer (l. i. pros. 4, p. 53) of Julius Canus, whose philosophic
      death is described by Seneca, (De Tranquillitate Animi, c. 14.)]

      95 (return) [ The characters of his two delators, Basilius (Var.
      ii. 10, 11, iv. 22) and Opilio, (v. 41, viii. 16,) are
      illustrated, not much to their honor, in the Epistles of
      Cassiodorus, which likewise mention Decoratus, (v. 31,) the
      worthless colleague of Beothius, (l. iii. pros. 4, p. 193.)]

      96 (return) [ A severe inquiry was instituted into the crime of
      magic, (Var. iv 22, 23, ix. 18;) and it was believed that many
      necromancers had escaped by making their jailers mad: for mad I
      should read drunk.]

      97 (return) [ Boethius had composed his own Apology, (p. 53,)
      perhaps more interesting than his Consolation. We must be content
      with the general view of his honors, principles, persecution,
      &c., (l. i. pros. 4, p. 42—62,) which may be compared with the
      short and weighty words of the Valesian Fragment, (p. 723.) An
      anonymous writer (Sinner, Catalog. Mss. Bibliot. Bern. tom. i. p.
      287) charges him home with honorable and patriotic treason.]

      While Boethius, oppressed with fetters, expected each moment the
      sentence or the stroke of death, he composed, in the tower of
      Pavia, the Consolation of Philosophy; a golden volume not
      unworthy of the leisure of Plato or Tully, but which claims
      incomparable merit from the barbarism of the times and the
      situation of the author. The celestial guide, whom he had so long
      invoked at Rome and Athens, now condescended to illumine his
      dungeon, to revive his courage, and to pour into his wounds her
      salutary balm. She taught him to compare his long prosperity and
      his recent distress, and to conceive new hopes from the
      inconstancy of fortune. Reason had informed him of the precarious
      condition of her gifts; experience had satisfied him of their
      real value; he had enjoyed them without guilt; he might resign
      them without a sigh, and calmly disdain the impotent malice of
      his enemies, who had left him happiness, since they had left him
      virtue. From the earth, Boethius ascended to heaven in search of
      the Supreme Good; explored the metaphysical labyrinth of chance
      and destiny, of prescience and free will, of time and eternity;
      and generously attempted to reconcile the perfect attributes of
      the Deity with the apparent disorders of his moral and physical
      government. Such topics of consolation so obvious, so vague, or
      so abstruse, are ineffectual to subdue the feelings of human
      nature. Yet the sense of misfortune may be diverted by the labor
      of thought; and the sage who could artfully combine in the same
      work the various riches of philosophy, poetry, and eloquence,
      must already have possessed the intrepid calmness which he
      affected to seek. Suspense, the worst of evils, was at length
      determined by the ministers of death, who executed, and perhaps
      exceeded, the inhuman mandate of Theodoric. A strong cord was
      fastened round the head of Boethius, and forcibly tightened, till
      his eyes almost started from their sockets; and some mercy may be
      discovered in the milder torture of beating him with clubs till
      he expired. 98 But his genius survived to diffuse a ray of
      knowledge over the darkest ages of the Latin world; the writings
      of the philosopher were translated by the most glorious of the
      English kings, 99 and the third emperor of the name of Otho
      removed to a more honorable tomb the bones of a Catholic saint,
      who, from his Arian persecutors, had acquired the honors of
      martyrdom, and the fame of miracles. 100 In the last hours of
      Boethius, he derived some comfort from the safety of his two
      sons, of his wife, and of his father-in-law, the venerable
      Symmachus. But the grief of Symmachus was indiscreet, and perhaps
      disrespectful: he had presumed to lament, he might dare to
      revenge, the death of an injured friend. He was dragged in chains
      from Rome to the palace of Ravenna; and the suspicions of
      Theodoric could only be appeased by the blood of an innocent and
      aged senator. 101

      98 (return) [ He was executed in Agro Calventiano, (Calvenzano,
      between Marignano and Pavia,) Anonym. Vales. p. 723, by order of
      Eusebius, count of Ticinum or Pavia. This place of confinement is
      styled the baptistery, an edifice and name peculiar to
      cathedrals. It is claimed by the perpetual tradition of the
      church of Pavia. The tower of Boethius subsisted till the year
      1584, and the draught is yet preserved, (Tiraboschi, tom. iii. p.
      47, 48.)]

      99 (return) [ See the Biographia Britannica, Alfred, tom. i. p.
      80, 2d edition. The work is still more honorable if performed
      under the learned eye of Alfred by his foreign and domestic
      doctors. For the reputation of Boethius in the middle ages,
      consult Brucker, (Hist. Crit. Philosoph. tom. iii. p. 565, 566.)]

      100 (return) [ The inscription on his new tomb was composed by
      the preceptor of Otho III., the learned Pope Silvester II., who,
      like Boethius himself, was styled a magician by the ignorance of
      the times. The Catholic martyr had carried his head in his hands
      a considerable way, (Baronius, A.D. 526, No. 17, 18;) and yet on
      a similar tale, a lady of my acquaintance once observed, “La
      distance n’y fait rien; il n’y a que lo remier pas qui coute.”
      Note: Madame du Deffand. This witticism referred to the miracle
      of St. Denis.—G.]

      101 (return) [ Boethius applauds the virtues of his
      father-in-law, (l. i. pros. 4, p. 59, l. ii. pros. 4, p. 118.)
      Procopius, (Goth. l. i. c. i.,) the Valesian Fragment, (p. 724,)
      and the Historia Miscella, (l. xv. p. 105,) agree in praising the
      superior innocence or sanctity of Symmachus; and in the
      estimation of the legend, the guilt of his murder is equal to the
      imprisonment of a pope.]

      Humanity will be disposed to encourage any report which testifies
      the jurisdiction of conscience and the remorse of kings; and
      philosophy is not ignorant that the most horrid spectres are
      sometimes created by the powers of a disordered fancy, and the
      weakness of a distempered body. After a life of virtue and glory,
      Theodoric was now descending with shame and guilt into the grave;
      his mind was humbled by the contrast of the past, and justly
      alarmed by the invisible terrors of futurity. One evening, as it
      is related, when the head of a large fish was served on the royal
      table, 102 he suddenly exclaimed, that he beheld the angry
      countenance of Symmachus, his eyes glaring fury and revenge, and
      his mouth armed with long sharp teeth, which threatened to devour
      him. The monarch instantly retired to his chamber, and, as he
      lay, trembling with aguish cold, under a weight of bed-clothes,
      he expressed, in broken murmurs to his physician Elpidius, his
      deep repentance for the murders of Boethius and Symmachus. 103
      His malady increased, and after a dysentery which continued three
      days, he expired in the palace of Ravenna, in the thirty-third,
      or, if we compute from the invasion of Italy, in the
      thirty-seventh year of his reign. Conscious of his approaching
      end, he divided his treasures and provinces between his two
      grandsons, and fixed the Rhone as their common boundary. 104
      Amalaric was restored to the throne of Spain. Italy, with all the
      conquests of the Ostrogoths, was bequeathed to Athalaric; whose
      age did not exceed ten years, but who was cherished as the last
      male offspring of the line of Amali, by the short-lived marriage
      of his mother Amalasuntha with a royal fugitive of the same
      blood. 105 In the presence of the dying monarch, the Gothic
      chiefs and Italian magistrates mutually engaged their faith and
      loyalty to the young prince, and to his guardian mother; and
      received, in the same awful moment, his last salutary advice, to
      maintain the laws, to love the senate and people of Rome, and to
      cultivate with decent reverence the friendship of the emperor.
      106 The monument of Theodoric was erected by his daughter
      Amalasuntha, in a conspicuous situation, which commanded the city
      of Ravenna, the harbor, and the adjacent coast. A chapel of a
      circular form, thirty feet in diameter, is crowned by a dome of
      one entire piece of granite: from the centre of the dome four
      columns arose, which supported, in a vase of porphyry, the
      remains of the Gothic king, surrounded by the brazen statues of
      the twelve apostles. 107 His spirit, after some previous
      expiation, might have been permitted to mingle with the
      benefactors of mankind, if an Italian hermit had not been
      witness, in a vision, to the damnation of Theodoric, 108 whose
      soul was plunged, by the ministers of divine vengeance, into the
      volcano of Lipari, one of the flaming mouths of the infernal
      world. 109

      102 (return) [ In the fanciful eloquence of Cassiodorus, the
      variety of sea and river fish are an evidence of extensive
      dominion; and those of the Rhine, of Sicily, and of the Danube,
      were served on the table of Theodoric, (Var. xii. 14.) The
      monstrous turbot of Domitian (Juvenal Satir. iii. 39) had been
      caught on the shores of the Adriatic.]
