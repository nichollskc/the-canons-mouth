Chapter L: Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants.—Part I.

     Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants.—Birth, Character, And
     Doctrine Of Mahomet.—He Preaches At Mecca.— Flies To
     Medina.—Propagates His Religion By The Sword.— Voluntary Or
     Reluctant Submission Of The Arabs.—His Death And Successors.—The
     Claims And Fortunes Of Ali And His Descendants.

      After pursuing above six hundred years the fleeting Caesars of
      Constantinople and Germany, I now descend, in the reign of
      Heraclius, on the eastern borders of the Greek monarchy. While
      the state was exhausted by the Persian war, and the church was
      distracted by the Nestorian and Monophysite sects, Mahomet, with
      the sword in one hand and the Koran in the other, erected his
      throne on the ruins of Christianity and of Rome. The genius of
      the Arabian prophet, the manners of his nation, and the spirit of
      his religion, involve the causes of the decline and fall of the
      Eastern empire; and our eyes are curiously intent on one of the
      most memorable revolutions, which have impressed a new and
      lasting character on the nations of the globe. 1

      1 (return) [ As in this and the following chapter I shall display
      much Arabic learning, I must profess my total ignorance of the
      Oriental tongues, and my gratitude to the learned interpreters,
      who have transfused their science into the Latin, French, and
      English languages. Their collections, versions, and histories, I
      shall occasionally notice.]

      In the vacant space between Persia, Syria, Egypt, and Aethiopia,
      the Arabian peninsula 2 may be conceived as a triangle of
      spacious but irregular dimensions. From the northern point of
      Beles 3 on the Euphrates, a line of fifteen hundred miles is
      terminated by the Straits of Bebelmandel and the land of
      frankincense. About half this length may be allowed for the
      middle breadth, from east to west, from Bassora to Suez, from the
      Persian Gulf to the Red Sea. 4 The sides of the triangle are
      gradually enlarged, and the southern basis presents a front of a
      thousand miles to the Indian Ocean. The entire surface of the
      peninsula exceeds in a fourfold proportion that of Germany or
      France; but the far greater part has been justly stigmatized with
      the epithets of the stony and the sandy. Even the wilds of
      Tartary are decked, by the hand of nature, with lofty trees and
      luxuriant herbage; and the lonesome traveller derives a sort of
      comfort and society from the presence of vegetable life. But in
      the dreary waste of Arabia, a boundless level of sand is
      intersected by sharp and naked mountains; and the face of the
      desert, without shade or shelter, is scorched by the direct and
      intense rays of a tropical sun. Instead of refreshing breezes,
      the winds, particularly from the south-west, diffuse a noxious
      and even deadly vapor; the hillocks of sand which they
      alternately raise and scatter, are compared to the billows of the
      ocean, and whole caravans, whole armies, have been lost and
      buried in the whirlwind. The common benefits of water are an
      object of desire and contest; and such is the scarcity of wood,
      that some art is requisite to preserve and propagate the element
      of fire. Arabia is destitute of navigable rivers, which fertilize
      the soil, and convey its produce to the adjacent regions: the
      torrents that fall from the hills are imbibed by the thirsty
      earth: the rare and hardy plants, the tamarind or the acacia,
      that strike their roots into the clefts of the rocks, are
      nourished by the dews of the night: a scanty supply of rain is
      collected in cisterns and aqueducts: the wells and springs are
      the secret treasure of the desert; and the pilgrim of Mecca, 5
      after many a dry and sultry march, is disgusted by the taste of
      the waters which have rolled over a bed of sulphur or salt. Such
      is the general and genuine picture of the climate of Arabia. The
      experience of evil enhances the value of any local or partial
      enjoyments. A shady grove, a green pasture, a stream of fresh
      water, are sufficient to attract a colony of sedentary Arabs to
      the fortunate spots which can afford food and refreshment to
      themselves and their cattle, and which encourage their industry
      in the cultivation of the palmtree and the vine. The high lands
      that border on the Indian Ocean are distinguished by their
      superior plenty of wood and water; the air is more temperate, the
      fruits are more delicious, the animals and the human race more
      numerous: the fertility of the soil invites and rewards the toil
      of the husbandman; and the peculiar gifts of frankincense 6 and
      coffee have attracted in different ages the merchants of the
      world. If it be compared with the rest of the peninsula, this
      sequestered region may truly deserve the appellation of the
      happy; and the splendid coloring of fancy and fiction has been
      suggested by contrast, and countenanced by distance. It was for
      this earthly paradise that Nature had reserved her choicest
      favors and her most curious workmanship: the incompatible
      blessings of luxury and innocence were ascribed to the natives:
      the soil was impregnated with gold 7 and gems, and both the land
      and sea were taught to exhale the odors of aromatic sweets. This
      division of the sandy, the stony, and the happy, so familiar to
      the Greeks and Latins, is unknown to the Arabians themselves; and
      it is singular enough, that a country, whose language and
      inhabitants have ever been the same, should scarcely retain a
      vestige of its ancient geography. The maritime districts of
      Bahrein and Oman are opposite to the realm of Persia. The kingdom
      of Yemen displays the limits, or at least the situation, of
      Arabia Felix: the name of Neged is extended over the inland
      space; and the birth of Mahomet has illustrated the province of
      Hejaz along the coast of the Red Sea. 8

      2 (return) [ The geographers of Arabia may be divided into three
      classes: 1. The Greeks and Latins, whose progressive knowledge
      may be traced in Agatharcides, (de Mari Rubro, in Hudson,
      Geograph. Minor. tom. i.,) Diodorus Siculus, (tom. i. l. ii. p.
      159-167, l. iii. p. 211-216, edit. Wesseling,) Strabo, (l. xvi.
      p. 1112-1114, from Eratosthenes, p. 1122-1132, from Artemidorus,)
      Dionysius, (Periegesis, 927-969,) Pliny, (Hist. Natur. v. 12, vi.
      32,) and Ptolemy, (Descript. et Tabulae Urbium, in Hudson, tom.
      iii.) 2. The Arabic writers, who have treated the subject with
      the zeal of patriotism or devotion: the extracts of Pocock
      (Specimen Hist. Arabum, p. 125-128) from the Geography of the
      Sherif al Edrissi, render us still more dissatisfied with the
      version or abridgment (p. 24-27, 44-56, 108, &c., 119, &c.) which
      the Maronites have published under the absurd title of Geographia
      Nubiensis, (Paris, 1619;) but the Latin and French translators,
      Greaves (in Hudson, tom. iii.) and Galland, (Voyage de la
      Palestine par La Roque, p. 265-346,) have opened to us the Arabia
      of Abulfeda, the most copious and correct account of the
      peninsula, which may be enriched, however, from the Bibliotheque
      Orientale of D’Herbelot, p. 120, et alibi passim. 3. The European
      travellers; among whom Shaw (p. 438-455) and Niebuhr
      (Description, 1773; Voyages, tom. i. 1776) deserve an honorable
      distinction: Busching (Geographie par Berenger, tom. viii. p.
      416-510) has compiled with judgment, and D’Anville’s Maps (Orbis
      Veteribus Notus, and 1re Partie de l’Asie) should lie before the
      reader, with his Geographie Ancienne, tom. ii. p. 208-231. *
      Note: Of modern travellers may be mentioned the adventurer who
      called himself Ali Bey; but above all, the intelligent, the
      enterprising the accurate Burckhardt.—M.]

      paradise or garden of a satrap, that Xenophon and the Greeks
      first passed the Euphrates, (Anabasis, l. i. c. 10, p. 29, edit.
      Wells.)]

      4 (return) [ Reland has proved, with much superfluous learning,

      1. That our Red Sea (the Arabian Gulf) is no more than a part of
      the Mare Rubrum, which was extended to the indefinite space of
      the Indian Ocean.

      2. That the synonymous words, allude to the color of the blacks
      or negroes, (Dissert Miscell. tom. i. p. 59-117.)]

      Mecca, there are fifteen destitute of good water. See the route
      of the Hadjees, in Shaw’s Travels, p. 477.]

      6 (return) [ The aromatics, especially the thus, or frankincense,
      of Arabia, occupy the xiith book of Pliny. Our great poet
      (Paradise Lost, l. iv.) introduces, in a simile, the spicy odors
      that are blown by the north-east wind from the Sabaean
      coast:——Many a league, Pleased with the grateful scent, old Ocean
      smiles. (Plin. Hist. Natur. xii. 42.)]

      7 (return) [ Agatharcides affirms, that lumps of pure gold were
      found, from the size of an olive to that of a nut; that iron was
      twice, and silver ten times, the value of gold, (de Mari Rubro,
      p. 60.) These real or imaginary treasures are vanished; and no
      gold mines are at present known in Arabia, (Niebuhr, Description,
      p. 124.) * Note: A brilliant passage in the geographical poem of
      Dionysius Periegetes embodies the notions of the ancients on the
      wealth and fertility of Yemen. Greek mythology, and the
      traditions of the “gorgeous east,” of India as well as Arabia,
      are mingled together in indiscriminate splendor. Compare on the
      southern coast of Arabia, the recent travels of Lieut.
      Wellsted—M.]

      8 (return) [ Consult, peruse, and study the Specimen Hostoriae
      Arabum of Pocock, (Oxon. 1650, in 4to.) The thirty pages of text
      and version are extracted from the Dynasties of Gregory
      Abulpharagius, which Pocock afterwards translated, (Oxon. 1663,
      in 4to.;) the three hundred and fifty-eight notes form a classic
      and original work on the Arabian antiquities.]

      The measure of population is regulated by the means of
      subsistence; and the inhabitants of this vast peninsula might be
      outnumbered by the subjects of a fertile and industrious
      province. Along the shores of the Persian Gulf, of the ocean, and
      even of the Red Sea, the Icthyophagi, 9 or fish eaters, continued
      to wander in quest of their precarious food. In this primitive
      and abject state, which ill deserves the name of society, the
      human brute, without arts or laws, almost without sense or
      language, is poorly distinguished from the rest of the animal
      creation. Generations and ages might roll away in silent
      oblivion, and the helpless savage was restrained from multiplying
      his race by the wants and pursuits which confined his existence
      to the narrow margin of the seacoast. But in an early period of
      antiquity the great body of the Arabs had emerged from this scene
      of misery; and as the naked wilderness could not maintain a
      people of hunters, they rose at once to the more secure and
      plentiful condition of the pastoral life. The same life is
      uniformly pursued by the roving tribes of the desert; and in the
      portrait of the modern Bedoweens, we may trace the features of
      their ancestors, 10 who, in the age of Moses or Mahomet, dwelt
      under similar tents, and conducted their horses, and camels, and
      sheep, to the same springs and the same pastures. Our toil is
      lessened, and our wealth is increased, by our dominion over the
      useful animals; and the Arabian shepherd had acquired the
      absolute possession of a faithful friend and a laborious slave.
      11 Arabia, in the opinion of the naturalist, is the genuine and
      original country of the horse; the climate most propitious, not
      indeed to the size, but to the spirit and swiftness, of that
      generous animal. The merit of the Barb, the Spanish, and the
      English breed, is derived from a mixture of Arabian blood: 12 the
      Bedoweens preserve, with superstitious care, the honors and the
      memory of the purest race: the males are sold at a high price,
      but the females are seldom alienated; and the birth of a noble
      foal was esteemed among the tribes, as a subject of joy and
      mutual congratulation. These horses are educated in the tents,
      among the children of the Arabs, with a tender familiarity, which
      trains them in the habits of gentleness and attachment. They are
      accustomed only to walk and to gallop: their sensations are not
      blunted by the incessant abuse of the spur and the whip: their
      powers are reserved for the moments of flight and pursuit: but no
      sooner do they feel the touch of the hand or the stirrup, than
      they dart away with the swiftness of the wind; and if their
      friend be dismounted in the rapid career, they instantly stop
      till he has recovered his seat. In the sands of Africa and
      Arabia, the camel is a sacred and precious gift. That strong and
      patient beast of burden can perform, without eating or drinking,
      a journey of several days; and a reservoir of fresh water is
      preserved in a large bag, a fifth stomach of the animal, whose
      body is imprinted with the marks of servitude: the larger breed
      is capable of transporting a weight of a thousand pounds; and the
      dromedary, of a lighter and more active frame, outstrips the
      fleetest courser in the race. Alive or dead, almost every part of
      the camel is serviceable to man: her milk is plentiful and
      nutritious: the young and tender flesh has the taste of veal: 13
      a valuable salt is extracted from the urine: the dung supplies
      the deficiency of fuel; and the long hair, which falls each year
      and is renewed, is coarsely manufactured into the garments, the
      furniture, and the tents of the Bedoweens. In the rainy seasons,
      they consume the rare and insufficient herbage of the desert:
      during the heats of summer and the scarcity of winter, they
      remove their encampments to the sea-coast, the hills of Yemen, or
      the neighborhood of the Euphrates, and have often extorted the
      dangerous license of visiting the banks of the Nile, and the
      villages of Syria and Palestine. The life of a wandering Arab is
      a life of danger and distress; and though sometimes, by rapine or
      exchange, he may appropriate the fruits of industry, a private
      citizen in Europe is in the possession of more solid and pleasing
      luxury than the proudest emir, who marches in the field at the
      head of ten thousand horse.

      9 (return) [ Arrian remarks the Icthyophagi of the coast of
      Hejez, (Periplus Maris Erythraei, p. 12,) and beyond Aden, (p.
      15.) It seems probable that the shores of the Red Sea (in the
      largest sense) were occupied by these savages in the time,
      perhaps, of Cyrus; but I can hardly believe that any cannibals
      were left among the savages in the reign of Justinian. (Procop.
      de Bell. Persic. l. i. c. 19.)]

      10 (return) [ See the Specimen Historiae Arabum of Pocock, p. 2,
      5, 86, &c. The journey of M. d’Arvieux, in 1664, to the camp of
      the emir of Mount Carmel, (Voyage de la Palestine, Amsterdam,
      1718,) exhibits a pleasing and original picture of the life of
      the Bedoweens, which may be illustrated from Niebuhr (Description
      de l’Arabie, p. 327-344) and Volney, (tom. i. p. 343-385,) the
      last and most judicious of our Syrian travellers.]

      11 (return) [ Read (it is no unpleasing task) the incomparable
      articles of the Horse and the Camel, in the Natural History of M.
      de Buffon.]

      12 (return) [ For the Arabian horses, see D’Arvieux (p. 159-173)
      and Niebuhr, (p. 142-144.) At the end of the xiiith century, the
      horses of Neged were esteemed sure-footed, those of Yemen strong
      and serviceable, those of Hejaz most noble. The horses of Europe,
      the tenth and last class, were generally despised as having too
      much body and too little spirit, (D’Herbelot, Bibliot. Orient. p.
      339: ) their strength was requisite to bear the weight of the
      knight and his armor]

      13 (return) [ Qui carnibus camelorum vesci solent odii tenaces
      sunt, was the opinion of an Arabian physician, (Pocock, Specimen,
      p. 88.) Mahomet himself, who was fond of milk, prefers the cow,
      and does not even mention the camel; but the diet of Mecca and
      Medina was already more luxurious, (Gagnier Vie de Mahomet, tom.
      iii. p. 404.)]

      Yet an essential difference may be found between the hordes of
      Scythia and the Arabian tribes; since many of the latter were
      collected into towns, and employed in the labors of trade and
      agriculture. A part of their time and industry was still devoted
      to the management of their cattle: they mingled, in peace and
      war, with their brethren of the desert; and the Bedoweens derived
      from their useful intercourse some supply of their wants, and
      some rudiments of art and knowledge. Among the forty-two cities
      of Arabia, 14 enumerated by Abulfeda, the most ancient and
      populous were situate in the happy Yemen: the towers of Saana, 15
      and the marvellous reservoir of Merab, 16 were constructed by the
      kings of the Homerites; but their profane lustre was eclipsed by
      the prophetic glories of Medina 17 and Mecca, 18 near the Red
      Sea, and at the distance from each other of two hundred and
      seventy miles. The last of these holy places was known to the
      Greeks under the name of Macoraba; and the termination of the
      word is expressive of its greatness, which has not, indeed, in
      the most flourishing period, exceeded the size and populousness
      of Marseilles. Some latent motive, perhaps of superstition, must
      have impelled the founders, in the choice of a most unpromising
      situation. They erected their habitations of mud or stone, in a
      plain about two miles long and one mile broad, at the foot of
      three barren mountains: the soil is a rock; the water even of the
      holy well of Zemzem is bitter or brackish; the pastures are
      remote from the city; and grapes are transported above seventy
      miles from the gardens of Tayef. The fame and spirit of the
      Koreishites, who reigned in Mecca, were conspicuous among the
      Arabian tribes; but their ungrateful soil refused the labors of
      agriculture, and their position was favorable to the enterprises
      of trade. By the seaport of Gedda, at the distance only of forty
      miles, they maintained an easy correspondence with Abyssinia; and
      that Christian kingdom afforded the first refuge to the disciples
      of Mahomet. The treasures of Africa were conveyed over the
      Peninsula to Gerrha or Katif, in the province of Bahrein, a city
      built, as it is said, of rock-salt, by the Chaldaean exiles; 19
      and from thence with the native pearls of the Persian Gulf, they
      were floated on rafts to the mouth of the Euphrates. Mecca is
      placed almost at an equal distance, a month’s journey, between
      Yemen on the right, and Syria on the left hand. The former was
      the winter, the latter the summer, station of her caravans; and
      their seasonable arrival relieved the ships of India from the
      tedious and troublesome navigation of the Red Sea. In the markets
      of Saana and Merab, in the harbors of Oman and Aden, the camels
      of the Koreishites were laden with a precious cargo of aromatics;
      a supply of corn and manufactures was purchased in the fairs of
      Bostra and Damascus; the lucrative exchange diffused plenty and
      riches in the streets of Mecca; and the noblest of her sons
      united the love of arms with the profession of merchandise. 20

      14 (return) [ Yet Marcian of Heraclea (in Periplo, p. 16, in tom.
      i. Hudson, Minor. Geograph.) reckons one hundred and sixty-four
      towns in Arabia Felix. The size of the towns might be small—the
      faith of the writer might be large.]

      15 (return) [ It is compared by Abulfeda (in Hudson, tom. ii. p.
      54) to Damascus, and is still the residence of the Imam of Yemen,
      (Voyages de Niebuhr, tom. i. p. 331-342.) Saana is twenty-four
      parasangs from Dafar, (Abulfeda, p. 51,) and sixty-eight from
      Aden, (p. 53.)]

      16 (return) [ Pocock, Specimen, p. 57. Geograph. Nubiensis, p.
      52. Meriaba, or Merab, six miles in circumference, was destroyed
      by the legions of Augustus, (Plin. Hist. Nat. vi. 32,) and had
      not revived in the xivth century, (Abulfed. Descript. Arab. p.
      58.) * Note: See note 2 to chap. i. The destruction of Meriaba by
      the Romans is doubtful. The town never recovered the inundation
      which took place from the bursting of a large reservoir of
      water—an event of great importance in the Arabian annals, and
      discussed at considerable length by modern Orientalists.—M.]

      17 (return) [ The name of city, Medina, was appropriated, to
      Yatreb. (the Iatrippa of the Greeks,) the seat of the prophet.
      The distances from Medina are reckoned by Abulfeda in stations,
      or days’ journey of a caravan, (p. 15: ) to Bahrein, xv.; to
      Bassora, xviii.; to Cufah, xx.; to Damascus or Palestine, xx.; to
      Cairo, xxv.; to Mecca. x.; from Mecca to Saana, (p. 52,) or Aden,
      xxx.; to Cairo, xxxi. days, or 412 hours, (Shaw’s Travels, p.
      477;) which, according to the estimate of D’Anville, (Mesures
      Itineraires, p. 99,) allows about twenty-five English miles for a
      day’s journey. From the land of frankincense (Hadramaut, in
      Yemen, between Aden and Cape Fartasch) to Gaza in Syria, Pliny
      (Hist. Nat. xii. 32) computes lxv. mansions of camels. These
      measures may assist fancy and elucidate facts.]

      18 (return) [ Our notions of Mecca must be drawn from the
      Arabians, (D’Herbelot, Bibliotheque Orientale, p. 368-371.
      Pocock, Specimen, p. 125-128. Abulfeda, p. 11-40.) As no
      unbeliever is permitted to enter the city, our travellers are
      silent; and the short hints of Thevenot (Voyages du Levant, part
      i. p. 490) are taken from the suspicious mouth of an African
      renegado. Some Persians counted 6000 houses, (Chardin. tom. iv.
      p. 167.) * Note: Even in the time of Gibbon, Mecca had not been
      so inaccessible to Europeans. It had been visited by Ludovico
      Barthema, and by one Joseph Pitts, of Exeter, who was taken
      prisoner by the Moors, and forcibly converted to Mahometanism.
      His volume is a curious, though plain, account of his sufferings
      and travels. Since that time Mecca has been entered, and the
      ceremonies witnessed, by Dr. Seetzen, whose papers were
      unfortunately lost; by the Spaniard, who called himself Ali Bey;
      and, lastly, by Burckhardt, whose description leaves nothing
      wanting to satisfy the curiosity.—M.]

      The perpetual independence of the Arabs has been the theme of
      praise among strangers and natives; and the arts of controversy
      transform this singular event into a prophecy and a miracle, in
      favor of the posterity of Ismael. 21 Some exceptions, that can
      neither be dismissed nor eluded, render this mode of reasoning as
      indiscreet as it is superfluous; the kingdom of Yemen has been
      successively subdued by the Abyssinians, the Persians, the
      sultans of Egypt, 22 and the Turks; 23 the holy cities of Mecca
      and Medina have repeatedly bowed under a Scythian tyrant; and the
      Roman province of Arabia 24 embraced the peculiar wilderness in
      which Ismael and his sons must have pitched their tents in the
      face of their brethren. Yet these exceptions are temporary or
      local; the body of the nation has escaped the yoke of the most
      powerful monarchies: the arms of Sesostris and Cyrus, of Pompey
      and Trajan, could never achieve the conquest of Arabia; the
      present sovereign of the Turks 25 may exercise a shadow of
      jurisdiction, but his pride is reduced to solicit the friendship
      of a people, whom it is dangerous to provoke, and fruitless to
      attack. The obvious causes of their freedom are inscribed on the
      character and country of the Arabs. Many ages before Mahomet, 26
      their intrepid valor had been severely felt by their neighbors in
      offensive and defensive war. The patient and active virtues of a
      soldier are insensibly nursed in the habits and discipline of a
      pastoral life. The care of the sheep and camels is abandoned to
      the women of the tribe; but the martial youth, under the banner
      of the emir, is ever on horseback, and in the field, to practise
      the exercise of the bow, the javelin, and the cimeter. The long
      memory of their independence is the firmest pledge of its
      perpetuity and succeeding generations are animated to prove their
      descent, and to maintain their inheritance. Their domestic feuds
      are suspended on the approach of a common enemy; and in their
      last hostilities against the Turks, the caravan of Mecca was
      attacked and pillaged by fourscore thousand of the confederates.
      When they advance to battle, the hope of victory is in the front;
      in the rear, the assurance of a retreat. Their horses and camels,
      who, in eight or ten days, can perform a march of four or five
      hundred miles, disappear before the conqueror; the secret waters
      of the desert elude his search, and his victorious troops are
      consumed with thirst, hunger, and fatigue, in the pursuit of an
      invisible foe, who scorns his efforts, and safely reposes in the
      heart of the burning solitude. The arms and deserts of the
      Bedoweens are not only the safeguards of their own freedom, but
      the barriers also of the happy Arabia, whose inhabitants, remote
      from war, are enervated by the luxury of the soil and climate.
      The legions of Augustus melted away in disease and lassitude; 27
      and it is only by a naval power that the reduction of Yemen has
      been successfully attempted. When Mahomet erected his holy
      standard, 28 that kingdom was a province of the Persian empire;
      yet seven princes of the Homerites still reigned in the
      mountains; and the vicegerent of Chosroes was tempted to forget
      his distant country and his unfortunate master. The historians of
      the age of Justinian represent the state of the independent
      Arabs, who were divided by interest or affection in the long
      quarrel of the East: the tribe of Gassan was allowed to encamp on
      the Syrian territory: the princes of Hira were permitted to form
      a city about forty miles to the southward of the ruins of
      Babylon. Their service in the field was speedy and vigorous; but
      their friendship was venal, their faith inconstant, their enmity
      capricious: it was an easier task to excite than to disarm these
      roving barbarians; and, in the familiar intercourse of war, they
      learned to see, and to despise, the splendid weakness both of
      Rome and of Persia. From Mecca to the Euphrates, the Arabian
      tribes 29 were confounded by the Greeks and Latins, under the
      general appellation of Saracens, 30 a name which every Christian
      mouth has been taught to pronounce with terror and abhorrence.

      Oriental situation, (Hottinger, Hist. Oriental. l. i. c. i. p. 7,

      is refuted by Ptolemy, (Arabia, p. 2, 18, in Hudson, tom. iv.,)
      who expressly remarks the western and southern position of the
      Saracens, then an obscure tribe on the borders of Egypt. The
      appellation cannot therefore allude to any national character;
      and, since it was imposed by strangers, it must be found, not in
      the Arabic, but in a foreign language. * Note: Dr. Clarke,
      (Travels, vol. ii. p. 491,) after expressing contemptuous pity
      for Gibbon’s ignorance, derives the word from Zara, Zaara, Sara,

      Marles adopts the derivation from Sarrik, a robber, (Hist. des

      Chapter L: Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants.—Part II.

      The slaves of domestic tyranny may vainly exult in their national
      independence: but the Arab is personally free; and he enjoys, in
      some degree, the benefits of society, without forfeiting the
      prerogatives of nature. In every tribe, superstition, or
      gratitude, or fortune, has exalted a particular family above the
      heads of their equals. The dignities of sheick and emir
      invariably descend in this chosen race; but the order of
      succession is loose and precarious; and the most worthy or aged
      of the noble kinsmen are preferred to the simple, though
      important, office of composing disputes by their advice, and
      guiding valor by their example. Even a female of sense and spirit
      has been permitted to command the countrymen of Zenobia. 31 The
      momentary junction of several tribes produces an army: their more
      lasting union constitutes a nation; and the supreme chief, the
      emir of emirs, whose banner is displayed at their head, may
      deserve, in the eyes of strangers, the honors of the kingly name.

      If the Arabian princes abuse their power, they are quickly
      punished by the desertion of their subjects, who had been
      accustomed to a mild and parental jurisdiction. Their spirit is
      free, their steps are unconfined, the desert is open, and the
      tribes and families are held together by a mutual and voluntary
      compact. The softer natives of Yemen supported the pomp and
      majesty of a monarch; but if he could not leave his palace
      without endangering his life, 32 the active powers of government
      must have been devolved on his nobles and magistrates. The cities
      of Mecca and Medina present, in the heart of Asia, the form, or
      rather the substance, of a commonwealth. The grandfather of
      Mahomet, and his lineal ancestors, appear in foreign and domestic
      transactions as the princes of their country; but they reigned,
      like Pericles at Athens, or the Medici at Florence, by the
      opinion of their wisdom and integrity; their influence was
      divided with their patrimony; and the sceptre was transferred
      from the uncles of the prophet to a younger branch of the tribe
      of Koreish. On solemn occasions they convened the assembly of the
      people; and, since mankind must be either compelled or persuaded
      to obey, the use and reputation of oratory among the ancient
      Arabs is the clearest evidence of public freedom. 33 But their
      simple freedom was of a very different cast from the nice and
      artificial machinery of the Greek and Roman republics, in which
      each member possessed an undivided share of the civil and
      political rights of the community. In the more simple state of
      the Arabs, the nation is free, because each of her sons disdains
      a base submission to the will of a master. His breast is
      fortified by the austere virtues of courage, patience, and
      sobriety; the love of independence prompts him to exercise the
      habits of self-command; and the fear of dishonor guards him from
      the meaner apprehension of pain, of danger, and of death. The
      gravity and firmness of the mind is conspicuous in his outward
      demeanor; his speech is low, weighty, and concise; he is seldom
      provoked to laughter; his only gesture is that of stroking his
      beard, the venerable symbol of manhood; and the sense of his own
      importance teaches him to accost his equals without levity, and
      his superiors without awe. 34 The liberty of the Saracens
      survived their conquests: the first caliphs indulged the bold and
      familiar language of their subjects; they ascended the pulpit to
      persuade and edify the congregation; nor was it before the seat
      of empire was removed to the Tigris, that the Abbasides adopted
      the proud and pompous ceremonial of the Persian and Byzantine
      courts.

      and sublime logic of Demosthenes.]

      34 (return) [ I must remind the reader that D’Arvieux,
      D’Herbelot, and Niebuhr, represent, in the most lively colors,
      the manners and government of the Arabs, which are illustrated by
      many incidental passages in the Life of Mahomet. * Note: See,
      likewise the curious romance of Antar, the most vivid and
      authentic picture of Arabian manners.—M.]

      In the study of nations and men, we may observe the causes that
      render them hostile or friendly to each other, that tend to
      narrow or enlarge, to mollify or exasperate, the social
      character. The separation of the Arabs from the rest of mankind
      has accustomed them to confound the ideas of stranger and enemy;
      and the poverty of the land has introduced a maxim of
      jurisprudence, which they believe and practise to the present
      hour. They pretend, that, in the division of the earth, the rich
      and fertile climates were assigned to the other branches of the
      human family; and that the posterity of the outlaw Ismael might
      recover, by fraud or force, the portion of inheritance of which
      he had been unjustly deprived. According to the remark of Pliny,
      the Arabian tribes are equally addicted to theft and merchandise;
      the caravans that traverse the desert are ransomed or pillaged;
      and their neighbors, since the remote times of Job and Sesostris,
      35 have been the victims of their rapacious spirit. If a Bedoween
      discovers from afar a solitary traveller, he rides furiously
      against him, crying, with a loud voice, “Undress thyself, thy
      aunt (my wife) is without a garment.” A ready submission entitles
      him to mercy; resistance will provoke the aggressor, and his own
      blood must expiate the blood which he presumes to shed in
      legitimate defence. A single robber, or a few associates, are
      branded with their genuine name; but the exploits of a numerous
      band assume the character of lawful and honorable war. The temper
      of a people thus armed against mankind was doubly inflamed by the
      domestic license of rapine, murder, and revenge. In the
      constitution of Europe, the right of peace and war is now
      confined to a small, and the actual exercise to a much smaller,
      list of respectable potentates; but each Arab, with impunity and
      renown, might point his javelin against the life of his
      countrymen. The union of the nation consisted only in a vague
      resemblance of language and manners; and in each community, the
      jurisdiction of the magistrate was mute and impotent. Of the time
      of ignorance which preceded Mahomet, seventeen hundred battles 36
      are recorded by tradition: hostility was imbittered with the
      rancor of civil faction; and the recital, in prose or verse, of
      an obsolete feud, was sufficient to rekindle the same passions
      among the descendants of the hostile tribes. In private life
      every man, at least every family, was the judge and avenger of
      his own cause. The nice sensibility of honor, which weighs the
      insult rather than the injury, sheds its deadly venom on the
      quarrels of the Arabs: the honor of their women, and of their
      beards, is most easily wounded; an indecent action, a
      contemptuous word, can be expiated only by the blood of the
      offender; and such is their patient inveteracy, that they expect
      whole months and years the opportunity of revenge. A fine or
      compensation for murder is familiar to the Barbarians of every
      age: but in Arabia the kinsmen of the dead are at liberty to
      accept the atonement, or to exercise with their own hands the law
      of retaliation. The refined malice of the Arabs refuses even the
      head of the murderer, substitutes an innocent for the guilty
      person, and transfers the penalty to the best and most
      considerable of the race by whom they have been injured. If he
      falls by their hands, they are exposed, in their turn, to the
      danger of reprisals, the interest and principal of the bloody
      debt are accumulated: the individuals of either family lead a
      life of malice and suspicion, and fifty years may sometimes
      elapse before the account of vengeance be finally settled. 37
      This sanguinary spirit, ignorant of pity or forgiveness, has been
      moderated, however, by the maxims of honor, which require in
      every private encounter some decent equality of age and strength,
      of numbers and weapons. An annual festival of two, perhaps of
      four, months, was observed by the Arabs before the time of
      Mahomet, during which their swords were religiously sheathed both
      in foreign and domestic hostility; and this partial truce is more
      strongly expressive of the habits of anarchy and warfare. 38

      the 9th and 10th century. The famous war of Dahes and Gabrah was

      revenge of murder are described by Niebuhr, (Description, p.
      26-31.) The harsher features of antiquity may be traced in the
      Koran, c. 2, p. 20, c. 17, p. 230, with Sale’s Observations.]

      38 (return) [ Procopius (de Bell. Persic. l. i. c. 16) places the
      two holy months about the summer solstice. The Arabians
      consecrate four months of the year—the first, seventh, eleventh,
      and twelfth; and pretend, that in a long series of ages the truce
      was infringed only four or six times, (Sale’s Preliminary
      Discourse, p. 147-150, and Notes on the ixth chapter of the
      Koran, p. 154, &c. Casiri, Bibliot. Hispano-Arabica, tom. ii. p.
      20, 21.)]

      But the spirit of rapine and revenge was attempered by the milder
      influence of trade and literature. The solitary peninsula is
      encompassed by the most civilized nations of the ancient world;
      the merchant is the friend of mankind; and the annual caravans
      imported the first seeds of knowledge and politeness into the
      cities, and even the camps of the desert. Whatever may be the
      pedigree of the Arabs, their language is derived from the same
      original stock with the Hebrew, the Syriac, and the Chaldaean
      tongues; the independence of the tribes was marked by their
      peculiar dialects; 39 but each, after their own, allowed a just
      preference to the pure and perspicuous idiom of Mecca. In Arabia,
      as well as in Greece, the perfection of language outstripped the
      refinement of manners; and her speech could diversify the
      fourscore names of honey, the two hundred of a serpent, the five
      hundred of a lion, the thousand of a sword, at a time when this
      copious dictionary was intrusted to the memory of an illiterate
      people. The monuments of the Homerites were inscribed with an
      obsolete and mysterious character; but the Cufic letters, the
      groundwork of the present alphabet, were invented on the banks of
      the Euphrates; and the recent invention was taught at Mecca by a
      stranger who settled in that city after the birth of Mahomet. The
      arts of grammar, of metre, and of rhetoric, were unknown to the
      freeborn eloquence of the Arabians; but their penetration was
      sharp, their fancy luxuriant, their wit strong and sententious,
      40 and their more elaborate compositions were addressed with
      energy and effect to the minds of their hearers. The genius and
      merit of a rising poet was celebrated by the applause of his own
      and the kindred tribes. A solemn banquet was prepared, and a
      chorus of women, striking their tymbals, and displaying the pomp
      of their nuptials, sung in the presence of their sons and
      husbands the felicity of their native tribe; that a champion had
      now appeared to vindicate their rights; that a herald had raised
      his voice to immortalize their renown. The distant or hostile
      tribes resorted to an annual fair, which was abolished by the
      fanaticism of the first Moslems; a national assembly that must
      have contributed to refine and harmonize the Barbarians. Thirty
      days were employed in the exchange, not only of corn and wine,
      but of eloquence and poetry. The prize was disputed by the
      generous emulation of the bards; the victorious performance was
      deposited in the archives of princes and emirs; and we may read
      in our own language, the seven original poems which were
      inscribed in letters of gold, and suspended in the temple of
      Mecca. 41 The Arabian poets were the historians and moralists of
      the age; and if they sympathized with the prejudices, they
      inspired and crowned the virtues, of their countrymen. The
      indissoluble union of generosity and valor was the darling theme
      of their song; and when they pointed their keenest satire against
      a despicable race, they affirmed, in the bitterness of reproach,
      that the men knew not how to give, nor the women to deny. 42 The
      same hospitality, which was practised by Abraham, and celebrated
      by Homer, is still renewed in the camps of the Arabs. The
      ferocious Bedoweens, the terror of the desert, embrace, without
      inquiry or hesitation, the stranger who dares to confide in their
      honor and to enter their tent. His treatment is kind and
      respectful: he shares the wealth, or the poverty, of his host;
      and, after a needful repose, he is dismissed on his way, with
      thanks, with blessings, and perhaps with gifts. The heart and
      hand are more largely expanded by the wants of a brother or a
      friend; but the heroic acts that could deserve the public
      applause, must have surpassed the narrow measure of discretion
      and experience. A dispute had arisen, who, among the citizens of
      Mecca, was entitled to the prize of generosity; and a successive
      application was made to the three who were deemed most worthy of
      the trial. Abdallah, the son of Abbas, had undertaken a distant
      journey, and his foot was in the stirrup when he heard the voice
      of a suppliant, “O son of the uncle of the apostle of God, I am a
      traveller, and in distress!” He instantly dismounted to present
      the pilgrim with his camel, her rich caparison, and a purse of
      four thousand pieces of gold, excepting only the sword, either
      for its intrinsic value, or as the gift of an honored kinsman.
      The servant of Kais informed the second suppliant that his master
      was asleep: but he immediately added, “Here is a purse of seven
      thousand pieces of gold, (it is all we have in the house,) and
      here is an order, that will entitle you to a camel and a slave;”
      the master, as soon as he awoke, praised and enfranchised his
      faithful steward, with a gentle reproof, that by respecting his
      slumbers he had stinted his bounty. The third of these heroes,
      the blind Arabah, at the hour of prayer, was supporting his steps
      on the shoulders of two slaves. “Alas!” he replied, “my coffers
      are empty! but these you may sell; if you refuse, I renounce
      them.” At these words, pushing away the youths, he groped along
      the wall with his staff.

      The character of Hatem is the perfect model of Arabian virtue: 43
      he was brave and liberal, an eloquent poet, and a successful
      robber; forty camels were roasted at his hospitable feast; and at
      the prayer of a suppliant enemy he restored both the captives and
      the spoil. The freedom of his countrymen disdained the laws of
      justice; they proudly indulged the spontaneous impulse of pity
      and benevolence.

      The religion of the Arabs, 44 as well as of the Indians,
      consisted in the worship of the sun, the moon, and the fixed
      stars; a primitive and specious mode of superstition. The bright
      luminaries of the sky display the visible image of a Deity: their
      number and distance convey to a philosophic, or even a vulgar,
      eye, the idea of boundless space: the character of eternity is
      marked on these solid globes, that seem incapable of corruption
      or decay: the regularity of their motions may be ascribed to a
      principle of reason or instinct; and their real, or imaginary,
      influence encourages the vain belief that the earth and its
      inhabitants are the object of their peculiar care. The science of
      astronomy was cultivated at Babylon; but the school of the Arabs
      was a clear firmament and a naked plain. In their nocturnal
      marches, they steered by the guidance of the stars: their names,
      and order, and daily station, were familiar to the curiosity and
      devotion of the Bedoween; and he was taught by experience to
      divide, in twenty-eight parts, the zodiac of the moon, and to
      bless the constellations who refreshed, with salutary rains, the
      thirst of the desert. The reign of the heavenly orbs could not be
      extended beyond the visible sphere; and some metaphysical powers
      were necessary to sustain the transmigration of souls and the
      resurrection of bodies: a camel was left to perish on the grave,
      that he might serve his master in another life; and the
      invocation of departed spirits implies that they were still
      endowed with consciousness and power. I am ignorant, and I am
      careless, of the blind mythology of the Barbarians; of the local
      deities, of the stars, the air, and the earth, of their sex or
      titles, their attributes or subordination. Each tribe, each
      family, each independent warrior, created and changed the rites
      and the object of his fantastic worship; but the nation, in every
      age, has bowed to the religion, as well as to the language, of
      Mecca. The genuine antiquity of the Caaba ascends beyond the
      Christian aera; in describing the coast of the Red Sea, the Greek
      historian Diodorus 45 has remarked, between the Thamudites and
      the Sabaeans, a famous temple, whose superior sanctity was
      revered by all the Arabians; the linen or silken veil, which is
      annually renewed by the Turkish emperor, was first offered by a
      pious king of the Homerites, who reigned seven hundred years
      before the time of Mahomet. 46 A tent, or a cavern, might suffice
      for the worship of the savages, but an edifice of stone and clay
      has been erected in its place; and the art and power of the
      monarchs of the East have been confined to the simplicity of the
      original model. 47 A spacious portico encloses the quadrangle of
      the Caaba; a square chapel, twenty-four cubits long, twenty-three
      broad, and twenty-seven high: a door and a window admit the
      light; the double roof is supported by three pillars of wood; a
      spout (now of gold) discharges the rain-water, and the well
      Zemzen is protected by a dome from accidental pollution. The
      tribe of Koreish, by fraud and force, had acquired the custody of
      the Caaba: the sacerdotal office devolved through four lineal
      descents to the grandfather of Mahomet; and the family of the
      Hashemites, from whence he sprung, was the most respectable and
      sacred in the eyes of their country. 48 The precincts of Mecca
      enjoyed the rights of sanctuary; and, in the last month of each
      year, the city and the temple were crowded with a long train of
      pilgrims, who presented their vows and offerings in the house of
      God. The same rites which are now accomplished by the faithful
      Mussulman, were invented and practised by the superstition of the
      idolaters. At an awful distance they cast away their garments:
      seven times, with hasty steps, they encircled the Caaba, and
      kissed the black stone: seven times they visited and adored the
      adjacent mountains; seven times they threw stones into the valley
      of Mina; and the pilgrimage was achieved, as at the present hour,
      by a sacrifice of sheep and camels, and the burial of their hair
      and nails in the consecrated ground. Each tribe either found or
      introduced in the Caaba their domestic worship: the temple was
      adorned, or defiled, with three hundred and sixty idols of men,
      eagles, lions, and antelopes; and most conspicuous was the statue
      of Hebal, of red agate, holding in his hand seven arrows, without
      heads or feathers, the instruments and symbols of profane
      divination. But this statue was a monument of Syrian arts: the
      devotion of the ruder ages was content with a pillar or a tablet;
      and the rocks of the desert were hewn into gods or altars, in
      imitation of the black stone 49 of Mecca, which is deeply tainted
      with the reproach of an idolatrous origin. From Japan to Peru,
      the use of sacrifice has universally prevailed; and the votary
      has expressed his gratitude, or fear, by destroying or consuming,
      in honor of the gods, the dearest and most precious of their
      gifts. The life of a man 50 is the most precious oblation to
      deprecate a public calamity: the altars of Phoenicia and Egypt,
      of Rome and Carthage, have been polluted with human gore: the
      cruel practice was long preserved among the Arabs; in the third
      century, a boy was annually sacrificed by the tribe of the
      Dumatians; 51 and a royal captive was piously slaughtered by the
      prince of the Saracens, the ally and soldier of the emperor
      Justinian. 52 A parent who drags his son to the altar, exhibits
      the most painful and sublime effort of fanaticism: the deed, or
      the intention, was sanctified by the example of saints and
      heroes; and the father of Mahomet himself was devoted by a rash
      vow, and hardly ransomed for the equivalent of a hundred camels.
      In the time of ignorance, the Arabs, like the Jews and Egyptians,
      abstained from the taste of swine’s flesh; 53 they circumcised 54
      their children at the age of puberty: the same customs, without
      the censure or the precept of the Koran, have been silently
      transmitted to their posterity and proselytes. It has been
      sagaciously conjectured, that the artful legislator indulged the
      stubborn prejudices of his countrymen. It is more simple to
      believe that he adhered to the habits and opinions of his youth,
      without foreseeing that a practice congenial to the climate of
      Mecca might become useless or inconvenient on the banks of the
      Danube or the Volga.

      between the Thamudites and the Sabaeans, but higher up than the
      coast inhabited by the former. Mr. Forster would place it as far

      Chapter L: Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants.—Part III.

      Arabia was free: the adjacent kingdoms were shaken by the storms
      of conquest and tyranny, and the persecuted sects fled to the
      happy land where they might profess what they thought, and
      practise what they professed. The religions of the Sabians and
      Magians, of the Jews and Christians, were disseminated from the
      Persian Gulf to the Red Sea. In a remote period of antiquity,
      Sabianism was diffused over Asia by the science of the Chaldaeans
      55 and the arms of the Assyrians. From the observations of two
      thousand years, the priests and astronomers of Babylon 56 deduced
      the eternal laws of nature and providence. They adored the seven
      gods or angels, who directed the course of the seven planets, and
      shed their irresistible influence on the earth. The attributes of
      the seven planets, with the twelve signs of the zodiac, and the
      twenty-four constellations of the northern and southern
      hemisphere, were represented by images and talismans; the seven
      days of the week were dedicated to their respective deities; the
      Sabians prayed thrice each day; and the temple of the moon at
      Haran was the term of their pilgrimage. 57 But the flexible
      genius of their faith was always ready either to teach or to
      learn: in the tradition of the creation, the deluge, and the
      patriarchs, they held a singular agreement with their Jewish
      captives; they appealed to the secret books of Adam, Seth, and
      Enoch; and a slight infusion of the gospel has transformed the
      last remnant of the Polytheists into the Christians of St. John,
      in the territory of Bassora. 58 The altars of Babylon were
      overturned by the Magians; but the injuries of the Sabians were
      revenged by the sword of Alexander; Persia groaned above five
      hundred years under a foreign yoke; and the purest disciples of
      Zoroaster escaped from the contagion of idolatry, and breathed
      with their adversaries the freedom of the desert. 59 Seven
      hundred years before the death of Mahomet, the Jews were settled
      in Arabia; and a far greater multitude was expelled from the Holy
      Land in the wars of Titus and Hadrian. The industrious exiles
      aspired to liberty and power: they erected synagogues in the
      cities, and castles in the wilderness, and their Gentile converts
      were confounded with the children of Israel, whom they resembled
      in the outward mark of circumcision. The Christian missionaries
      were still more active and successful: the Catholics asserted
      their universal reign; the sects whom they oppressed,
      successively retired beyond the limits of the Roman empire; the
      Marcionites and Manichaeans dispersed their fantastic opinions
      and apocryphal gospels; the churches of Yemen, and the princes of
      Hira and Gassan, were instructed in a purer creed by the Jacobite
      and Nestorian bishops. 60 The liberty of choice was presented to
      the tribes: each Arab was free to elect or to compose his private
      religion: and the rude superstition of his house was mingled with
      the sublime theology of saints and philosophers. A fundamental
      article of faith was inculcated by the consent of the learned
      strangers; the existence of one supreme God who is exalted above
      the powers of heaven and earth, but who has often revealed
      himself to mankind by the ministry of his angels and prophets,
      and whose grace or justice has interrupted, by seasonable
      miracles, the order of nature. The most rational of the Arabs
      acknowledged his power, though they neglected his worship; 61 and
      it was habit rather than conviction that still attached them to
      the relics of idolatry. The Jews and Christians were the people
      of the Book; the Bible was already translated into the Arabic
      language, 62 and the volume of the Old Testament was accepted by
      the concord of these implacable enemies. In the story of the
      Hebrew patriarchs, the Arabs were pleased to discover the fathers
      of their nation. They applauded the birth and promises of Ismael;
      revered the faith and virtue of Abraham; traced his pedigree and
      their own to the creation of the first man, and imbibed, with
      equal credulity, the prodigies of the holy text, and the dreams
      and traditions of the Jewish rabbis.

      The base and plebeian origin of Mahomet is an unskilful calumny
      of the Christians, 63 who exalt instead of degrading the merit of
      their adversary. His descent from Ismael was a national privilege
      or fable; but if the first steps of the pedigree 64 are dark and
      doubtful, he could produce many generations of pure and genuine
      nobility: he sprung from the tribe of Koreish and the family of
      Hashem, the most illustrious of the Arabs, the princes of Mecca,
      and the hereditary guardians of the Caaba. The grandfather of
      Mahomet was Abdol Motalleb, the son of Hashem, a wealthy and
      generous citizen, who relieved the distress of famine with the
      supplies of commerce. Mecca, which had been fed by the liberality
      of the father, was saved by the courage of the son. The kingdom
      of Yemen was subject to the Christian princes of Abyssinia; their
      vassal Abrahah was provoked by an insult to avenge the honor of
      the cross; and the holy city was invested by a train of elephants
      and an army of Africans. A treaty was proposed; and, in the first
      audience, the grandfather of Mahomet demanded the restitution of
      his cattle. “And why,” said Abrahah, “do you not rather implore
      my clemency in favor of your temple, which I have threatened to
      destroy?” “Because,” replied the intrepid chief, “the cattle is
      my own; the Caaba belongs to the gods, and they will defend their
      house from injury and sacrilege.” The want of provisions, or the
      valor of the Koreish, compelled the Abyssinians to a disgraceful
      retreat: their discomfiture has been adorned with a miraculous
      flight of birds, who showered down stones on the heads of the
      infidels; and the deliverance was long commemorated by the aera
      of the elephant. 65 The glory of Abdol Motalleb was crowned with
      domestic happiness; his life was prolonged to the age of one
      hundred and ten years; and he became the father of six daughters
      and thirteen sons. His best beloved Abdallah was the most
      beautiful and modest of the Arabian youth; and in the first
      night, when he consummated his marriage with Amina, 651 of the
      noble race of the Zahrites, two hundred virgins are said to have
      expired of jealousy and despair. Mahomet, or more properly
      Mohammed, the only son of Abdallah and Amina, was born at Mecca,
      four years after the death of Justinian, and two months after the
      defeat of the Abyssinians, 66 whose victory would have introduced
      into the Caaba the religion of the Christians. In his early
      infancy, he was deprived of his father, his mother, and his
      grandfather; his uncles were strong and numerous; and, in the
      division of the inheritance, the orphan’s share was reduced to
      five camels and an Aethiopian maid-servant. At home and abroad,
      in peace and war, Abu Taleb, the most respectable of his uncles,
      was the guide and guardian of his youth; in his twenty-fifth
      year, he entered into the service of Cadijah, a rich and noble
      widow of Mecca, who soon rewarded his fidelity with the gift of
      her hand and fortune. The marriage contract, in the simple style
      of antiquity, recites the mutual love of Mahomet and Cadijah;
      describes him as the most accomplished of the tribe of Koreish;
      and stipulates a dowry of twelve ounces of gold and twenty
      camels, which was supplied by the liberality of his uncle. 67 By
      this alliance, the son of Abdallah was restored to the station of
      his ancestors; and the judicious matron was content with his
      domestic virtues, till, in the fortieth year of his age, 68 he
      assumed the title of a prophet, and proclaimed the religion of
      the Koran.

      is too dark and uncertain to support the Benedictines, (Art. de

      week, deduce a new mode of calculation, and remove the birth of

      (Dynast. p. 101, and Errata, Pocock’s version.) While we refine
      our chronology, it is possible that the illiterate prophet was
      ignorant of his own age. * Note: The date of the birth of Mahomet
      is not yet fixed with precision. It is only known from Oriental
      authors that he was born on a Monday, the 10th Reby 1st, the
      third month of the Mahometan year; the year 40 or 42 of Chosroes

      According to the tradition of his companions, Mahomet 69 was
      distinguished by the beauty of his person, an outward gift which
      is seldom despised, except by those to whom it has been refused.
      Before he spoke, the orator engaged on his side the affections of
      a public or private audience. They applauded his commanding
      presence, his majestic aspect, his piercing eye, his gracious
      smile, his flowing beard, his countenance that painted every
      sensation of the soul, and his gestures that enforced each
      expression of the tongue. In the familiar offices of life he
      scrupulously adhered to the grave and ceremonious politeness of
      his country: his respectful attention to the rich and powerful
      was dignified by his condescension and affability to the poorest
      citizens of Mecca: the frankness of his manner concealed the
      artifice of his views; and the habits of courtesy were imputed to
      personal friendship or universal benevolence. His memory was
      capacious and retentive; his wit easy and social; his imagination
      sublime; his judgment clear, rapid, and decisive. He possessed
      the courage both of thought and action; and, although his designs
      might gradually expand with his success, the first idea which he
      entertained of his divine mission bears the stamp of an original
      and superior genius. The son of Abdallah was educated in the
      bosom of the noblest race, in the use of the purest dialect of
      Arabia; and the fluency of his speech was corrected and enhanced
      by the practice of discreet and seasonable silence. With these
      powers of eloquence, Mahomet was an illiterate Barbarian: his
      youth had never been instructed in the arts of reading and
      writing; 70 the common ignorance exempted him from shame or
      reproach, but he was reduced to a narrow circle of existence, and
      deprived of those faithful mirrors, which reflect to our mind the
      minds of sages and heroes. Yet the book of nature and of man was
      open to his view; and some fancy has been indulged in the
      political and philosophical observations which are ascribed to
      the Arabian traveller. 71 He compares the nations and the regions
      of the earth; discovers the weakness of the Persian and Roman
      monarchies; beholds, with pity and indignation, the degeneracy of
      the times; and resolves to unite under one God and one king the
      invincible spirit and primitive virtues of the Arabs. Our more
      accurate inquiry will suggest, that, instead of visiting the
      courts, the camps, the temples, of the East, the two journeys of
      Mahomet into Syria were confined to the fairs of Bostra and
      Damascus; that he was only thirteen years of age when he
      accompanied the caravan of his uncle; and that his duty compelled
      him to return as soon as he had disposed of the merchandise of
      Cadijah. In these hasty and superficial excursions, the eye of
      genius might discern some objects invisible to his grosser
      companions; some seeds of knowledge might be cast upon a fruitful
      soil; but his ignorance of the Syriac language must have checked
      his curiosity; and I cannot perceive, in the life or writings of
      Mahomet, that his prospect was far extended beyond the limits of
      the Arabian world. From every region of that solitary world, the
      pilgrims of Mecca were annually assembled, by the calls of
      devotion and commerce: in the free concourse of multitudes, a
      simple citizen, in his native tongue, might study the political
      state and character of the tribes, the theory and practice of the
      Jews and Christians. Some useful strangers might be tempted, or
      forced, to implore the rights of hospitality; and the enemies of
      Mahomet have named the Jew, the Persian, and the Syrian monk,
      whom they accuse of lending their secret aid to the composition
      of the Koran. 72 Conversation enriches the understanding, but
      solitude is the school of genius; and the uniformity of a work
      denotes the hand of a single artist. From his earliest youth
      Mahomet was addicted to religious contemplation; each year,
      during the month of Ramadan, he withdrew from the world, and from
      the arms of Cadijah: in the cave of Hera, three miles from Mecca,
      73 he consulted the spirit of fraud or enthusiasm, whose abode is
      not in the heavens, but in the mind of the prophet. The faith
      which, under the name of Islam, he preached to his family and
      nation, is compounded of an eternal truth, and a necessary
      fiction, That there is only one God, and that Mahomet is the
      apostle of God.

      alone, denies the ignorance, to accuse the imposture, of the
      prophet. His arguments are far from satisfactory. Two short
      trading journeys to the fairs of Syria were surely not sufficient
      to infuse a science so rare among the citizens of Mecca: it was
      not in the cool, deliberate act of treaty, that Mahomet would
      have dropped the mask; nor can any conclusion be drawn from the
      words of disease and delirium. The lettered youth, before he
      aspired to the prophetic character, must have often exercised, in
      private life, the arts of reading and writing; and his first
      converts, of his own family, would have been the first to detect
      and upbraid his scandalous hypocrisy, (White’s Sermons, p. 203,
      204, Notes, p. xxxvi.—xxxviii.) * Note: (Academ. des Inscript. I.
      p. 295) has observed that the text of the seveth Sura implies
      that Mahomet could read, the tradition alone denies it, and,
      according to Dr. Weil, (p. 46,) there is another reading of the
      tradition, that “he could not read well.” Dr. Weil is not quite
      so successful in explaining away Sura xxix. It means, he thinks
      that he had not read any books, from which he could have
      borrowed.—M. 1845.]

      It is the boast of the Jewish apologists, that while the learned
      nations of antiquity were deluded by the fables of polytheism,
      their simple ancestors of Palestine preserved the knowledge and
      worship of the true God. The moral attributes of Jehovah may not
      easily be reconciled with the standard of human virtue: his
      metaphysical qualities are darkly expressed; but each page of the
      Pentateuch and the Prophets is an evidence of his power: the
      unity of his name is inscribed on the first table of the law; and
      his sanctuary was never defiled by any visible image of the
      invisible essence. After the ruin of the temple, the faith of the
      Hebrew exiles was purified, fixed, and enlightened, by the
      spiritual devotion of the synagogue; and the authority of Mahomet
      will not justify his perpetual reproach, that the Jews of Mecca
      or Medina adored Ezra as the son of God. 74 But the children of
      Israel had ceased to be a people; and the religions of the world
      were guilty, at least in the eyes of the prophet, of giving sons,
      or daughters, or companions, to the supreme God. In the rude
      idolatry of the Arabs, the crime is manifest and audacious: the
      Sabians are poorly excused by the preeminence of the first
      planet, or intelligence, in their celestial hierarchy; and in the
      Magian system the conflict of the two principles betrays the
      imperfection of the conqueror. The Christians of the seventh
      century had insensibly relapsed into a semblance of Paganism:
      their public and private vows were addressed to the relics and
      images that disgraced the temples of the East: the throne of the
      Almighty was darkened by a cloud of martyrs, and saints, and
      angels, the objects of popular veneration; and the Collyridian
      heretics, who flourished in the fruitful soil of Arabia, invested
      the Virgin Mary with the name and honors of a goddess. 75 The
      mysteries of the Trinity and Incarnation appear to contradict the
      principle of the divine unity. In their obvious sense, they
      introduce three equal deities, and transform the man Jesus into
      the substance of the Son of God: 76 an orthodox commentary will
      satisfy only a believing mind: intemperate curiosity and zeal had
      torn the veil of the sanctuary; and each of the Oriental sects
      was eager to confess that all, except themselves, deserved the
      reproach of idolatry and polytheism. The creed of Mahomet is free
      from suspicion or ambiguity; and the Koran is a glorious
      testimony to the unity of God. The prophet of Mecca rejected the
      worship of idols and men, of stars and planets, on the rational
      principle that whatever rises must set, that whatever is born
      must die, that whatever is corruptible must decay and perish. 77
      In the Author of the universe, his rational enthusiasm confessed
      and adored an infinite and eternal being, without form or place,
      without issue or similitude, present to our most secret thoughts,
      existing by the necessity of his own nature, and deriving from
      himself all moral and intellectual perfection. These sublime
      truths, thus announced in the language of the prophet, 78 are
      firmly held by his disciples, and defined with metaphysical
      precision by the interpreters of the Koran. A philosophic theist
      might subscribe the popular creed of the Mahometans; 79 a creed
      too sublime, perhaps, for our present faculties. What object
      remains for the fancy, or even the understanding, when we have
      abstracted from the unknown substance all ideas of time and
      space, of motion and matter, of sensation and reflection? The
      first principle of reason and revolution was confirmed by the
      voice of Mahomet: his proselytes, from India to Morocco, are
      distinguished by the name of Unitarians; and the danger of
      idolatry has been prevented by the interdiction of images. The
      doctrine of eternal decrees and absolute predestination is
      strictly embraced by the Mahometans; and they struggle, with the
      common difficulties, how to reconcile the prescience of God with
      the freedom and responsibility of man; how to explain the
      permission of evil under the reign of infinite power and infinite
      goodness.

      because he made man after his own image.]

      The God of nature has written his existence on all his works, and
      his law in the heart of man. To restore the knowledge of the one,
      and the practice of the other, has been the real or pretended aim
      of the prophets of every age: the liberality of Mahomet allowed
      to his predecessors the same credit which he claimed for himself;
      and the chain of inspiration was prolonged from the fall of Adam
      to the promulgation of the Koran. 80 During that period, some
      rays of prophetic light had been imparted to one hundred and
      twenty-four thousand of the elect, discriminated by their
      respective measure of virtue and grace; three hundred and
      thirteen apostles were sent with a special commission to recall
      their country from idolatry and vice; one hundred and four
      volumes have been dictated by the Holy Spirit; and six
      legislators of transcendent brightness have announced to mankind
      the six successive revelations of various rites, but of one
      immutable religion. The authority and station of Adam, Noah,
      Abraham, Moses, Christ, and Mahomet, rise in just gradation above
      each other; but whosoever hates or rejects any one of the
      prophets is numbered with the infidels. The writings of the
      patriarchs were extant only in the apocryphal copies of the
      Greeks and Syrians: 81 the conduct of Adam had not entitled him
      to the gratitude or respect of his children; the seven precepts
      of Noah were observed by an inferior and imperfect class of the
      proselytes of the synagogue; 82 and the memory of Abraham was
      obscurely revered by the Sabians in his native land of Chaldaea:
      of the myriads of prophets, Moses and Christ alone lived and
      reigned; and the remnant of the inspired writings was comprised
      in the books of the Old and the New Testament. The miraculous
      story of Moses is consecrated and embellished in the Koran; 83
      and the captive Jews enjoy the secret revenge of imposing their
      own belief on the nations whose recent creeds they deride. For
      the author of Christianity, the Mahometans are taught by the
      prophet to entertain a high and mysterious reverence. 84 “Verily,
      Christ Jesus, the son of Mary, is the apostle of God, and his
      word, which he conveyed unto Mary, and a Spirit proceeding from
      him; honorable in this world, and in the world to come, and one
      of those who approach near to the presence of God.” 85 The
      wonders of the genuine and apocryphal gospels 86 are profusely
      heaped on his head; and the Latin church has not disdained to
      borrow from the Koran the immaculate conception 87 of his virgin
      mother. Yet Jesus was a mere mortal; and, at the day of judgment,
      his testimony will serve to condemn both the Jews, who reject him
      as a prophet, and the Christians, who adore him as the Son of
      God. The malice of his enemies aspersed his reputation, and
      conspired against his life; but their intention only was guilty;
      a phantom or a criminal was substituted on the cross; and the
      innocent saint was translated to the seventh heaven. 88 During
      six hundred years the gospel was the way of truth and salvation;
      but the Christians insensibly forgot both the laws and example of
      their founder; and Mahomet was instructed by the Gnostics to
      accuse the church, as well as the synagogue, of corrupting the
      integrity of the sacred text. 89 The piety of Moses and of Christ
      rejoiced in the assurance of a future prophet, more illustrious
      than themselves: the evangelical promise of the Paraclete, or
      Holy Ghost, was prefigured in the name, and accomplished in the
      person, of Mahomet, 90 the greatest and the last of the apostles
      of God.

      Chapter L: Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants.—Part IV.

      The communication of ideas requires a similitude of thought and
      language: the discourse of a philosopher would vibrate without
      effect on the ear of a peasant; yet how minute is the distance of
      their understandings, if it be compared with the contact of an
      infinite and a finite mind, with the word of God expressed by the
      tongue or the pen of a mortal! The inspiration of the Hebrew
      prophets, of the apostles and evangelists of Christ, might not be
      incompatible with the exercise of their reason and memory; and
      the diversity of their genius is strongly marked in the style and
      composition of the books of the Old and New Testament. But
      Mahomet was content with a character, more humble, yet more
      sublime, of a simple editor; the substance of the Koran, 91
      according to himself or his disciples, is uncreated and eternal;
      subsisting in the essence of the Deity, and inscribed with a pen
      of light on the table of his everlasting decrees. A paper copy,
      in a volume of silk and gems, was brought down to the lowest
      heaven by the angel Gabriel, who, under the Jewish economy, had
      indeed been despatched on the most important errands; and this
      trusty messenger successively revealed the chapters and verses to
      the Arabian prophet. Instead of a perpetual and perfect measure
      of the divine will, the fragments of the Koran were produced at
      the discretion of Mahomet; each revelation is suited to the
      emergencies of his policy or passion; and all contradiction is
      removed by the saving maxim, that any text of Scripture is
      abrogated or modified by any subsequent passage. The word of God,
      and of the apostle, was diligently recorded by his disciples on
      palm-leaves and the shoulder-bones of mutton; and the pages,
      without order or connection, were cast into a domestic chest, in
      the custody of one of his wives. Two years after the death of
      Mahomet, the sacred volume was collected and published by his
      friend and successor Abubeker: the work was revised by the caliph
      Othman, in the thirtieth year of the Hegira; and the various
      editions of the Koran assert the same miraculous privilege of a
      uniform and incorruptible text. In the spirit of enthusiasm or
      vanity, the prophet rests the truth of his mission on the merit
      of his book; audaciously challenges both men and angels to
      imitate the beauties of a single page; and presumes to assert
      that God alone could dictate this incomparable performance. 92
      This argument is most powerfully addressed to a devout Arabian,
      whose mind is attuned to faith and rapture; whose ear is
      delighted by the music of sounds; and whose ignorance is
      incapable of comparing the productions of human genius. 93 The
      harmony and copiousness of style will not reach, in a version,
      the European infidel: he will peruse with impatience the endless
      incoherent rhapsody of fable, and precept, and declamation, which
      seldom excites a sentiment or an idea, which sometimes crawls in
      the dust, and is sometimes lost in the clouds. The divine
      attributes exalt the fancy of the Arabian missionary; but his
      loftiest strains must yield to the sublime simplicity of the book
      of Job, composed in a remote age, in the same country, and in the
      same language. 94 If the composition of the Koran exceed the
      faculties of a man to what superior intelligence should we
      ascribe the Iliad of Homer, or the Philippics of Demosthenes? In
      all religions, the life of the founder supplies the silence of
      his written revelation: the sayings of Mahomet were so many
      lessons of truth; his actions so many examples of virtue; and the
      public and private memorials were preserved by his wives and
      companions. At the end of two hundred years, the Sonna, or oral
      law, was fixed and consecrated by the labors of Al Bochari, who
      discriminated seven thousand two hundred and seventy-five genuine
      traditions, from a mass of three hundred thousand reports, of a
      more doubtful or spurious character. Each day the pious author
      prayed in the temple of Mecca, and performed his ablutions with
      the water of Zemzem: the pages were successively deposited on the
      pulpit and the sepulchre of the apostle; and the work has been
      approved by the four orthodox sects of the Sonnites. 95

      much earlier dialect; or the Chaldaic may have adopted the
      poetical archaisms of a dialect, differing from, but not less
      ancient than, the Hebrew. See Rosenmuller, Proleg. on Job, p. 41.

      The mission of the ancient prophets, of Moses and of Jesus had
      been confirmed by many splendid prodigies; and Mahomet was
      repeatedly urged, by the inhabitants of Mecca and Medina, to
      produce a similar evidence of his divine legation; to call down
      from heaven the angel or the volume of his revelation, to create
      a garden in the desert, or to kindle a conflagration in the
      unbelieving city. As often as he is pressed by the demands of the
      Koreish, he involves himself in the obscure boast of vision and
      prophecy, appeals to the internal proofs of his doctrine, and
      shields himself behind the providence of God, who refuses those
      signs and wonders that would depreciate the merit of faith, and
      aggravate the guilt of infidelity But the modest or angry tone of
      his apologies betrays his weakness and vexation; and these
      passages of scandal established, beyond suspicion, the integrity
      of the Koran. 96 The votaries of Mahomet are more assured than
      himself of his miraculous gifts; and their confidence and
      credulity increase as they are farther removed from the time and
      place of his spiritual exploits. They believe or affirm that
      trees went forth to meet him; that he was saluted by stones; that
      water gushed from his fingers; that he fed the hungry, cured the
      sick, and raised the dead; that a beam groaned to him; that a
      camel complained to him; that a shoulder of mutton informed him
      of its being poisoned; and that both animate and inanimate nature
      were equally subject to the apostle of God. 97 His dream of a
      nocturnal journey is seriously described as a real and corporeal
      transaction. A mysterious animal, the Borak, conveyed him from
      the temple of Mecca to that of Jerusalem: with his companion
      Gabriel he successively ascended the seven heavens, and received
      and repaid the salutations of the patriarchs, the prophets, and
      the angels, in their respective mansions. Beyond the seventh
      heaven, Mahomet alone was permitted to proceed; he passed the
      veil of unity, approached within two bow-shots of the throne, and
      felt a cold that pierced him to the heart, when his shoulder was
      touched by the hand of God. After this familiar, though important
      conversation, he again descended to Jerusalem, remounted the
      Borak, returned to Mecca, and performed in the tenth part of a
      night the journey of many thousand years. 98 According to another
      legend, the apostle confounded in a national assembly the
      malicious challenge of the Koreish. His resistless word split
      asunder the orb of the moon: the obedient planet stooped from her
      station in the sky, accomplished the seven revolutions round the
      Caaba, saluted Mahomet in the Arabian tongue, and, suddenly
      contracting her dimensions, entered at the collar, and issued
      forth through the sleeve, of his shirt. 99 The vulgar are amused
      with these marvellous tales; but the gravest of the Mussulman
      doctors imitate the modesty of their master, and indulge a
      latitude of faith or interpretation. 100 They might speciously
      allege, that in preaching the religion it was needless to violate
      the harmony of nature; that a creed unclouded with mystery may be
      excused from miracles; and that the sword of Mahomet was not less
      potent than the rod of Moses.

      the passages which deny his miracles are clear and positive,
      (Alcoran, tom. i. part ii. p. 7-12,) and those which seem to
      assert them are ambiguous and insufficient, (p. 12-22.)]

      absurdities; and by Gagnier (tom. i. p. 252-343,) who declares,
      from the zealous Al Jannabi, that to deny this journey, is to
      disbelieve the Koran. Yet the Koran without naming either heaven,
      or Jerusalem, or Mecca, has only dropped a mysterious hint: Laus
      illi qui transtulit servum suum ab oratorio Haram ad oratorium
      remotissimum, (Koran, c. 17, v. 1; in Maracci, tom. ii. p. 407;

      aerial structure of tradition.]

      99 (return) [ In the prophetic style, which uses the present or

      688.) This figure of rhetoric has been converted into a fact,
      which is said to be attested by the most respectable
      eye-witnesses, (Maracci, tom. ii. p. 690.) The festival is still
      celebrated by the Persians, (Chardin, tom. iv. p. 201;) and the
      legend is tediously spun out by Gagnier, (Vie de Mahomet, tom. i.
      p. 183-234,) on the faith, as it should seem, of the credulous Al
      Jannabi. Yet a Mahometan doctor has arraigned the credit of the
      principal witness, (apud Pocock, Specimen, p. 187;) the best
      interpreters are content with the simple sense of the Koran. (Al
      Beidawi, apud Hottinger, Hist. Orient. l. ii. p. 302;) and the
      silence of Abulfeda is worthy of a prince and a philosopher. *

      100 (return) [ Abulpharagius, in Specimen Hist. Arab. p. 17; and
      his scepticism is justified in the notes of Pocock, p. 190-194,
      from the purest authorities.]

      The polytheist is oppressed and distracted by the variety of
      superstition: a thousand rites of Egyptian origin were interwoven
      with the essence of the Mosaic law; and the spirit of the gospel
      had evaporated in the pageantry of the church. The prophet of
      Mecca was tempted by prejudice, or policy, or patriotism, to
      sanctify the rites of the Arabians, and the custom of visiting
      the holy stone of the Caaba. But the precepts of Mahomet himself
      inculcates a more simple and rational piety: prayer, fasting, and
      alms, are the religious duties of a Mussulman; and he is
      encouraged to hope, that prayer will carry him half way to God,
      fasting will bring him to the door of his palace, and alms will
      gain him admittance. 101 I. According to the tradition of the
      nocturnal journey, the apostle, in his personal conference with
      the Deity, was commanded to impose on his disciples the daily
      obligation of fifty prayers. By the advice of Moses, he applied
      for an alleviation of this intolerable burden; the number was
      gradually reduced to five; without any dispensation of business
      or pleasure, or time or place: the devotion of the faithful is
      repeated at daybreak, at noon, in the afternoon, in the evening,
      and at the first watch of the night; and in the present decay of
      religious fervor, our travellers are edified by the profound
      humility and attention of the Turks and Persians. Cleanliness is
      the key of prayer: the frequent lustration of the hands, the
      face, and the body, which was practised of old by the Arabs, is
      solemnly enjoined by the Koran; and a permission is formally
      granted to supply with sand the scarcity of water. The words and
      attitudes of supplication, as it is performed either sitting, or
      standing, or prostrate on the ground, are prescribed by custom or
      authority; but the prayer is poured forth in short and fervent
      ejaculations; the measure of zeal is not exhausted by a tedious
      liturgy; and each Mussulman for his own person is invested with
      the character of a priest. Among the theists, who reject the use
      of images, it has been found necessary to restrain the wanderings
      of the fancy, by directing the eye and the thought towards a
      kebla, or visible point of the horizon. The prophet was at first
      inclined to gratify the Jews by the choice of Jerusalem; but he
      soon returned to a more natural partiality; and five times every
      day the eyes of the nations at Astracan, at Fez, at Delhi, are
      devoutly turned to the holy temple of Mecca. Yet every spot for
      the service of God is equally pure: the Mahometans indifferently
      pray in their chamber or in the street. As a distinction from the
      Jews and Christians, the Friday in each week is set apart for the
      useful institution of public worship: the people is assembled in
      the mosch; and the imam, some respectable elder, ascends the
      pulpit, to begin the prayer and pronounce the sermon. But the
      Mahometan religion is destitute of priesthood or sacrifice; and
      the independent spirit of fanaticism looks down with contempt on
      the ministers and the slaves of superstition. 1011

      II. The voluntary 102 penance of the ascetics, the torment and
      glory of their lives, was odious to a prophet who censured in his
      companions a rash vow of abstaining from flesh, and women, and
      sleep; and firmly declared, that he would suffer no monks in his
      religion. 103 Yet he instituted, in each year, a fast of thirty
      days; and strenuously recommended the observance as a discipline
      which purifies the soul and subdues the body, as a salutary
      exercise of obedience to the will of God and his apostle. During
      the month of Ramadan, from the rising to the setting of the sun,
      the Mussulman abstains from eating, and drinking, and women, and
      baths, and perfumes; from all nourishment that can restore his
      strength, from all pleasure that can gratify his senses. In the
      revolution of the lunar year, the Ramadan coincides, by turns,
      with the winter cold and the summer heat; and the patient martyr,
      without assuaging his thirst with a drop of water, must expect
      the close of a tedious and sultry day. The interdiction of wine,
      peculiar to some orders of priests or hermits, is converted by
      Mahomet alone into a positive and general law; 104 and a
      considerable portion of the globe has abjured, at his command,
      the use of that salutary, though dangerous, liquor. These painful
      restraints are, doubtless, infringed by the libertine, and eluded
      by the hypocrite; but the legislator, by whom they are enacted,
      cannot surely be accused of alluring his proselytes by the
      indulgence of their sensual appetites. III. The charity of the
      Mahometans descends to the animal creation; and the Koran
      repeatedly inculcates, not as a merit, but as a strict and
      indispensable duty, the relief of the indigent and unfortunate.
      Mahomet, perhaps, is the only lawgiver who has defined the
      precise measure of charity: the standard may vary with the degree
      and nature of property, as it consists either in money, in corn
      or cattle, in fruits or merchandise; but the Mussulman does not
      accomplish the law, unless he bestows a tenth of his revenue; and
      if his conscience accuses him of fraud or extortion, the tenth,
      under the idea of restitution, is enlarged to a fifth. 105
      Benevolence is the foundation of justice, since we are forbid to
      injure those whom we are bound to assist. A prophet may reveal
      the secrets of heaven and of futurity; but in his moral precepts
      he can only repeat the lessons of our own hearts.

      101 (return) [ The most authentic account of these precepts,
      pilgrimage, prayer, fasting, alms, and ablutions, is extracted
      from the Persian and Arabian theologians by Maracci, (Prodrom.
      part iv. p. 9-24,) Reland, (in his excellent treatise de
      Religione Mohammedica, Utrecht, 1717, p. 67-123,) and Chardin,
      (Voyages in Perse, tom. iv. p. 47-195.) Marace is a partial
      accuser; but the jeweller, Chardin, had the eyes of a
      philosopher; and Reland, a judicious student, had travelled over
      the East in his closet at Utrecht. The xivth letter of Tournefort
      (Voyage du Levont, tom. ii. p. 325-360, in octavo) describes what
      he had seen of the religion of the Turks.]

      1011 (return) [ Such is Mahometanism beyond the precincts of the
      Holy City. But Mahomet retained, and the Koran sanctions, (Sale’s
      Koran, c. 5, in inlt. c. 22, vol. ii. p. 171, 172,) the sacrifice
      of sheep and camels (probably according to the old Arabian rites)
      at Mecca; and the pilgrims complete their ceremonial with
      sacrifices, sometimes as numerous and costly as those of King
      Solomon. Compare note, vol. iv. c. xxiii. p. 96, and Forster’s
      Mahometanism Unveiled, vol. i. p. 420. This author quotes the
      questionable authority of Benjamin of Tudela, for the sacrifice
      of a camel by the caliph at Bosra; but sacrifice undoubtedly
      forms no part of the ordinary Mahometan ritual; nor will the
      sanctity of the caliph, as the earthly representative of the
      prophet, bear any close analogy to the priesthood of the Mosaic
      or Gentila religions.—M.]

      102 (return) [ Mahomet (Sale’s Koran, c. 9, p. 153) reproaches
      the Christians with taking their priests and monks for their
      lords, besides God. Yet Maracci (Prodromus, part iii. p. 69, 70)
      excuses the worship, especially of the pope, and quotes, from the
      Koran itself, the case of Eblis, or Satan, who was cast from
      heaven for refusing to adore Adam.]

      103 (return) [ Koran, c. 5, p. 94, and Sale’s note, which refers
      to the authority of Jallaloddin and Al Beidawi. D’Herbelot
      declares, that Mahomet condemned la vie religieuse; and that the
      first swarms of fakirs, dervises, &c., did not appear till after
      the year 300 of the Hegira, (Bibliot. Orient. p. 292, 718.)]

      104 (return) [ See the double prohibition, (Koran, c. 2, p. 25,
      c. 5, p. 94;) the one in the style of a legislator, the other in
      that of a fanatic. The public and private motives of Mahomet are
      investigated by Prideaux (Life of Mahomet, p. 62-64) and Sale,
      (Preliminary Discourse, p. 124.)]

      105 (return) [ The jealousy of Maracci (Prodromus, part iv. p.
      33) prompts him to enumerate the more liberal alms of the
      Catholics of Rome. Fifteen great hospitals are open to many
      thousand patients and pilgrims; fifteen hundred maidens are
      annually portioned; fifty-six charity schools are founded for
      both sexes; one hundred and twenty confraternities relieve the
      wants of their brethren, &c. The benevolence of London is still
      more extensive; but I am afraid that much more is to be ascribed
      to the humanity, than to the religion, of the people.]

      The two articles of belief, and the four practical duties, of
      Islam, are guarded by rewards and punishments; and the faith of
      the Mussulman is devoutly fixed on the event of the judgment and
      the last day. The prophet has not presumed to determine the
      moment of that awful catastrophe, though he darkly announces the
      signs, both in heaven and earth, which will precede the universal
      dissolution, when life shall be destroyed, and the order of
      creation shall be confounded in the primitive chaos. At the blast
      of the trumpet, new worlds will start into being: angels, genii,
      and men will arise from the dead, and the human soul will again
      be united to the body. The doctrine of the resurrection was first
      entertained by the Egyptians; 106 and their mummies were
      embalmed, their pyramids were constructed, to preserve the
      ancient mansion of the soul, during a period of three thousand
      years. But the attempt is partial and unavailing; and it is with
      a more philosophic spirit that Mahomet relies on the omnipotence
      of the Creator, whose word can reanimate the breathless clay, and
      collect the innumerable atoms, that no longer retain their form
      or substance. 107 The intermediate state of the soul it is hard
      to decide; and those who most firmly believe her immaterial
      nature, are at a loss to understand how she can think or act
      without the agency of the organs of sense.

      106 (return) [ See Herodotus (l. ii. c. 123) and our learned
      countryman Sir John Marsham, (Canon. Chronicus, p. 46.) The same
      writer (p. 254-274) is an elaborate sketch of the infernal
      regions, as they were painted by the fancy of the Egyptians and
      Greeks, of the poets and philosophers of antiquity.]

      107 (return) [ The Koran (c. 2, p. 259, &c.; of Sale, p. 32; of
      Maracci, p. 97) relates an ingenious miracle, which satisfied the
      curiosity, and confirmed the faith, of Abraham.]

      The reunion of the soul and body will be followed by the final
      judgment of mankind; and in his copy of the Magian picture, the
      prophet has too faithfully represented the forms of proceeding,
      and even the slow and successive operations, of an earthly
      tribunal. By his intolerant adversaries he is upbraided for
      extending, even to themselves, the hope of salvation, for
      asserting the blackest heresy, that every man who believes in
      God, and accomplishes good works, may expect in the last day a
      favorable sentence. Such rational indifference is ill adapted to
      the character of a fanatic; nor is it probable that a messenger
      from heaven should depreciate the value and necessity of his own
      revelation. In the idiom of the Koran, 108 the belief of God is
      inseparable from that of Mahomet: the good works are those which
      he has enjoined, and the two qualifications imply the profession
      of Islam, to which all nations and all sects are equally invited.

      Their spiritual blindness, though excused by ignorance and
      crowned with virtue, will be scourged with everlasting torments;
      and the tears which Mahomet shed over the tomb of his mother for
      whom he was forbidden to pray, display a striking contrast of
      humanity and enthusiasm. 109 The doom of the infidels is common:
      the measure of their guilt and punishment is determined by the
      degree of evidence which they have rejected, by the magnitude of
      the errors which they have entertained: the eternal mansions of
      the Christians, the Jews, the Sabians, the Magians, and
      idolaters, are sunk below each other in the abyss; and the lowest
      hell is reserved for the faithless hypocrites who have assumed
      the mask of religion. After the greater part of mankind has been
      condemned for their opinions, the true believers only will be
      judged by their actions. The good and evil of each Mussulman will
      be accurately weighed in a real or allegorical balance; and a
      singular mode of compensation will be allowed for the payment of
      injuries: the aggressor will refund an equivalent of his own good
      actions, for the benefit of the person whom he has wronged; and
      if he should be destitute of any moral property, the weight of
      his sins will be loaded with an adequate share of the demerits of
      the sufferer. According as the shares of guilt or virtue shall
      preponderate, the sentence will be pronounced, and all, without
      distinction, will pass over the sharp and perilous bridge of the
      abyss; but the innocent, treading in the footsteps of Mahomet,
      will gloriously enter the gates of paradise, while the guilty
      will fall into the first and mildest of the seven hells. The term
      of expiation will vary from nine hundred to seven thousand years;
      but the prophet has judiciously promised, that all his disciples,
      whatever may be their sins, shall be saved, by their own faith
      and his intercession from eternal damnation. It is not surprising
      that superstition should act most powerfully on the fears of her
      votaries, since the human fancy can paint with more energy the
      misery than the bliss of a future life. With the two simple
      elements of darkness and fire, we create a sensation of pain,
      which may be aggravated to an infinite degree by the idea of
      endless duration. But the same idea operates with an opposite
      effect on the continuity of pleasure; and too much of our present
      enjoyments is obtained from the relief, or the comparison, of
      evil. It is natural enough that an Arabian prophet should dwell
      with rapture on the groves, the fountains, and the rivers of
      paradise; but instead of inspiring the blessed inhabitants with a
      liberal taste for harmony and science, conversation and
      friendship, he idly celebrates the pearls and diamonds, the robes
      of silk, palaces of marble, dishes of gold, rich wines,
      artificial dainties, numerous attendants, and the whole train of
      sensual and costly luxury, which becomes insipid to the owner,
      even in the short period of this mortal life. Seventy-two Houris,
      or black-eyed girls, of resplendent beauty, blooming youth,
      virgin purity, and exquisite sensibility, will be created for the
      use of the meanest believer; a moment of pleasure will be
      prolonged to a thousand years; and his faculties will be
      increased a hundred fold, to render him worthy of his felicity.
      Notwithstanding a vulgar prejudice, the gates of heaven will be
      open to both sexes; but Mahomet has not specified the male
      companions of the female elect, lest he should either alarm the
      jealousy of their former husbands, or disturb their felicity, by
      the suspicion of an everlasting marriage. This image of a carnal
      paradise has provoked the indignation, perhaps the envy, of the
      monks: they declaim against the impure religion of Mahomet; and
      his modest apologists are driven to the poor excuse of figures
      and allegories. But the sounder and more consistent party adhere
      without shame, to the literal interpretation of the Koran:
      useless would be the resurrection of the body, unless it were
      restored to the possession and exercise of its worthiest
      faculties; and the union of sensual and intellectual enjoyment is
      requisite to complete the happiness of the double animal, the
      perfect man. Yet the joys of the Mahometan paradise will not be
      confined to the indulgence of luxury and appetite; and the
      prophet has expressly declared that all meaner happiness will be
      forgotten and despised by the saints and martyrs, who shall be
      admitted to the beatitude of the divine vision. 110

      article of Mahomet, Bayle has shown how indifferently wit and
      philosophy supply the absence of genuine information.]

      The first and most arduous conquests of Mahomet 111 were those of
      his wife, his servant, his pupil, and his friend; 112 since he
      presented himself as a prophet to those who were most conversant
      with his infirmities as a man. Yet Cadijah believed the words,
      and cherished the glory, of her husband; the obsequious and
      affectionate Zeid was tempted by the prospect of freedom; the
      illustrious Ali, the son of Abu Taleb, embraced the sentiments of
      his cousin with the spirit of a youthful hero; and the wealth,
      the moderation, the veracity of Abubeker confirmed the religion
      of the prophet whom he was destined to succeed. By his
      persuasion, ten of the most respectable citizens of Mecca were
      introduced to the private lessons of Islam; they yielded to the
      voice of reason and enthusiasm; they repeated the fundamental
      creed, “There is but one God, and Mahomet is the apostle of God;”
      and their faith, even in this life, was rewarded with riches and
      honors, with the command of armies and the government of
      kingdoms. Three years were silently employed in the conversion of
      fourteen proselytes, the first-fruits of his mission; but in the
      fourth year he assumed the prophetic office, and resolving to
      impart to his family the light of divine truth, he prepared a
      banquet, a lamb, as it is said, and a bowl of milk, for the
      entertainment of forty guests of the race of Hashem. “Friends and
      kinsmen,” said Mahomet to the assembly, “I offer you, and I alone
      can offer, the most precious of gifts, the treasures of this
      world and of the world to come. God has commanded me to call you
      to his service. Who among you will support my burden? Who among
      you will be my companion and my vizier?” 113 No answer was
      returned, till the silence of astonishment, and doubt, and
      contempt, was at length broken by the impatient courage of Ali, a
      youth in the fourteenth year of his age. “O prophet, I am the
      man: whosoever rises against thee, I will dash out his teeth,
      tear out his eyes, break his legs, rip up his belly. O prophet, I
      will be thy vizier over them.” Mahomet accepted his offer with
      transport, and Abu Taled was ironically exhorted to respect the
      superior dignity of his son. In a more serious tone, the father
      of Ali advised his nephew to relinquish his impracticable design.

      “Spare your remonstrances,” replied the intrepid fanatic to his
      uncle and benefactor; “if they should place the sun on my right
      hand, and the moon on my left, they should not divert me from my
      course.” He persevered ten years in the exercise of his mission;
      and the religion which has overspread the East and the West
      advanced with a slow and painful progress within the walls of
      Mecca. Yet Mahomet enjoyed the satisfaction of beholding the
      increase of his infant congregation of Unitarians, who revered
      him as a prophet, and to whom he seasonably dispensed the
      spiritual nourishment of the Koran. The number of proselytes may
      be esteemed by the absence of eighty-three men and eighteen
      women, who retired to Aethiopia in the seventh year of his
      mission; and his party was fortified by the timely conversion of
      his uncle Hamza, and of the fierce and inflexible Omar, who
      signalized in the cause of Islam the same zeal, which he had
      exerted for its destruction. Nor was the charity of Mahomet
      confined to the tribe of Koreish, or the precincts of Mecca: on
      solemn festivals, in the days of pilgrimage, he frequented the
      Caaba, accosted the strangers of every tribe, and urged, both in
      private converse and public discourse, the belief and worship of
      a sole Deity. Conscious of his reason and of his weakness, he
      asserted the liberty of conscience, and disclaimed the use of
      religious violence: 114 but he called the Arabs to repentance,
      and conjured them to remember the ancient idolaters of Ad and
      Thamud, whom the divine justice had swept away from the face of
      the earth. 115

      111 (return) [ Before I enter on the history of the prophet, it
      is incumbent on me to produce my evidence. The Latin, French, and
      English versions of the Koran are preceded by historical
      discourses, and the three translators, Maracci, (tom. i. p.
      10-32,) Savary, (tom. i. p. 1-248,) and Sale, (Preliminary
      Discourse, p. 33-56,) had accurately studied the language and
      character of their author. Two professed Lives of Mahomet have
      been composed by Dr. Prideaux (Life of Mahomet, seventh edition,
      London, 1718, in octavo) and the count de Boulainvilliers, (Vie
      de Mahomed, Londres, 1730, in octavo: ) but the adverse wish of
      finding an impostor or a hero, has too often corrupted the
      learning of the doctor and the ingenuity of the count. The
      article in D’Herbelot (Bibliot. Orient. p. 598-603) is chiefly
      drawn from Novairi and Mirkond; but the best and most authentic
      of our guides is M. Gagnier, a Frenchman by birth, and professor
      at Oxford of the Oriental tongues. In two elaborate works,
      (Ismael Abulfeda de Vita et Rebus gestis Mohammedis, &c. Latine
      vertit, Praefatione et Notis illustravit Johannes Gagnier, Oxon.
      1723, in folio. La Vie de Mahomet traduite et compilee de
      l’Alcoran, des Traditions Authentiques de la Sonna et des
      meilleurs Auteurs Arabes; Amsterdam, 1748, 3 vols. in 12mo.,) he
      has interpreted, illustrated, and supplied the Arabic text of
      Abulfeda and Al Jannabi; the first, an enlightened prince who
      reigned at Hamah, in Syria, A.D. 1310-1332, (see Gagnier Praefat.
      ad Abulfed.;) the second, a credulous doctor, who visited Mecca
      A.D. 1556. (D’Herbelot, p. 397. Gagnier, tom. iii. p. 209, 210.)
      These are my general vouchers, and the inquisitive reader may
      follow the order of time, and the division of chapters. Yet I
      must observe that both Abulfeda and Al Jannabi are modern
      historians, and that they cannot appeal to any writers of the
      first century of the Hegira. * Note: A new Life, by Dr. Weil,
      (Stuttgart. 1843,) has added some few traditions unknown in
      Europe. Of Dr. Weil’s Arabic scholarship, which professes to
      correct many errors in Gagnier, in Maracci, and in M. von Hammer,
      I am no judge. But it is remarkable that he does not seem
      acquainted with the passage of Tabari, translated by Colonel Vans
      Kennedy, in the Bombay Transactions, (vol. iii.,) the earliest
      and most important addition made to the traditionary Life of
      Mahomet. I am inclined to think Colonel Vans Kennedy’s
      appreciation of the prophet’s character, which may be overlooked
      in a criticism on Voltaire’s Mahomet, the most just which I have
      ever read. The work of Dr. Weil appears to me most valuable in
      its dissection and chronological view of the Koran.—M. 1845]

      Chapter L: Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants.—Part V.

      The people of Mecca were hardened in their unbelief by
      superstition and envy. The elders of the city, the uncles of the
      prophet, affected to despise the presumption of an orphan, the
      reformer of his country: the pious orations of Mahomet in the
      Caaba were answered by the clamors of Abu Taleb. “Citizens and
      pilgrims, listen not to the tempter, hearken not to his impious
      novelties. Stand fast in the worship of Al Lata and Al Uzzah.”
      Yet the son of Abdallah was ever dear to the aged chief: and he
      protected the fame and person of his nephew against the assaults
      of the Koreishites, who had long been jealous of the preeminence
      of the family of Hashem. Their malice was colored with the
      pretence of religion: in the age of Job, the crime of impiety was
      punished by the Arabian magistrate; 116 and Mahomet was guilty of
      deserting and denying the national deities. But so loose was the
      policy of Mecca, that the leaders of the Koreish, instead of
      accusing a criminal, were compelled to employ the measures of
      persuasion or violence. They repeatedly addressed Abu Taleb in
      the style of reproach and menace. “Thy nephew reviles our
      religion; he accuses our wise forefathers of ignorance and folly;
      silence him quickly, lest he kindle tumult and discord in the
      city. If he persevere, we shall draw our swords against him and
      his adherents, and thou wilt be responsible for the blood of thy
      fellow-citizens.” The weight and moderation of Abu Taleb eluded
      the violence of religious faction; the most helpless or timid of
      the disciples retired to Aethiopia, and the prophet withdrew
      himself to various places of strength in the town and country. As
      he was still supported by his family, the rest of the tribe of
      Koreish engaged themselves to renounce all intercourse with the
      children of Hashem, neither to buy nor sell, neither to marry not
      to give in marriage, but to pursue them with implacable enmity,
      till they should deliver the person of Mahomet to the justice of
      the gods. The decree was suspended in the Caaba before the eyes
      of the nation; the messengers of the Koreish pursued the
      Mussulman exiles in the heart of Africa: they besieged the
      prophet and his most faithful followers, intercepted their water,
      and inflamed their mutual animosity by the retaliation of
      injuries and insults. A doubtful truce restored the appearances
      of concord till the death of Abu Taleb abandoned Mahomet to the
      power of his enemies, at the moment when he was deprived of his
      domestic comforts by the loss of his faithful and generous
      Cadijah. Abu Sophian, the chief of the branch of Ommiyah,
      succeeded to the principality of the republic of Mecca. A zealous
      votary of the idols, a mortal foe of the line of Hashem, he
      convened an assembly of the Koreishites and their allies, to
      decide the fate of the apostle. His imprisonment might provoke
      the despair of his enthusiasm; and the exile of an eloquent and
      popular fanatic would diffuse the mischief through the provinces
      of Arabia. His death was resolved; and they agreed that a sword
      from each tribe should be buried in his heart, to divide the
      guilt of his blood, and baffle the vengeance of the Hashemites.
      An angel or a spy revealed their conspiracy; and flight was the
      only resource of Mahomet. 117 At the dead of night, accompanied
      by his friend Abubeker, he silently escaped from his house: the
      assassins watched at the door; but they were deceived by the
      figure of Ali, who reposed on the bed, and was covered with the
      green vestment of the apostle. The Koreish respected the piety of
      the heroic youth; but some verses of Ali, which are still extant,
      exhibit an interesting picture of his anxiety, his tenderness,
      and his religious confidence. Three days Mahomet and his
      companion were concealed in the cave of Thor, at the distance of
      a league from Mecca; and in the close of each evening, they
      received from the son and daughter of Abubeker a secret supply of
      intelligence and food. The diligence of the Koreish explored
      every haunt in the neighborhood of the city: they arrived at the
      entrance of the cavern; but the providential deceit of a spider’s
      web and a pigeon’s nest is supposed to convince them that the
      place was solitary and inviolate. “We are only two,” said the
      trembling Abubeker. “There is a third,” replied the prophet; “it
      is God himself.” No sooner was the pursuit abated than the two
      fugitives issued from the rock, and mounted their camels: on the
      road to Medina, they were overtaken by the emissaries of the
      Koreish; they redeemed themselves with prayers and promises from
      their hands. In this eventful moment, the lance of an Arab might
      have changed the history of the world. The flight of the prophet
      from Mecca to Medina has fixed the memorable aera of the Hegira,
      118 which, at the end of twelve centuries, still discriminates
      the lunar years of the Mahometan nations. 119

      The religion of the Koran might have perished in its cradle, had
      not Medina embraced with faith and reverence the holy outcasts of
      Mecca. Medina, or the city, known under the name of Yathreb,
      before it was sanctified by the throne of the prophet, was
      divided between the tribes of the Charegites and the Awsites,
      whose hereditary feud was rekindled by the slightest
      provocations: two colonies of Jews, who boasted a sacerdotal
      race, were their humble allies, and without converting the Arabs,
      they introduced the taste of science and religion, which
      distinguished Medina as the city of the Book. Some of her noblest
      citizens, in a pilgrimage to the Canaba, were converted by the
      preaching of Mahomet; on their return, they diffused the belief
      of God and his prophet, and the new alliance was ratified by
      their deputies in two secret and nocturnal interviews on a hill
      in the suburbs of Mecca. In the first, ten Charegites and two
      Awsites united in faith and love, protested, in the name of their
      wives, their children, and their absent brethren, that they would
      forever profess the creed, and observe the precepts, of the
      Koran. The second was a political association, the first vital
      spark of the empire of the Saracens. 120 Seventy-three men and
      two women of Medina held a solemn conference with Mahomet, his
      kinsman, and his disciples; and pledged themselves to each other
      by a mutual oath of fidelity. They promised, in the name of the
      city, that if he should be banished, they would receive him as a
      confederate, obey him as a leader, and defend him to the last
      extremity, like their wives and children. “But if you are
      recalled by your country,” they asked with a flattering anxiety,
      “will you not abandon your new allies?” “All things,” replied
      Mahomet with a smile, “are now common between us; your blood is
      as my blood, your ruin as my ruin. We are bound to each other by
      the ties of honor and interest. I am your friend, and the enemy
      of your foes.” “But if we are killed in your service, what,”
      exclaimed the deputies of Medina, “will be our reward?”
      “Paradise,” replied the prophet. “Stretch forth thy hand.” He
      stretched it forth, and they reiterated the oath of allegiance
      and fidelity. Their treaty was ratified by the people, who
      unanimously embraced the profession of Islam; they rejoiced in
      the exile of the apostle, but they trembled for his safety, and
      impatiently expected his arrival. After a perilous and rapid
      journey along the sea-coast, he halted at Koba, two miles from
      the city, and made his public entry into Medina, sixteen days
      after his flight from Mecca. Five hundred of the citizens
      advanced to meet him; he was hailed with acclamations of loyalty
      and devotion; Mahomet was mounted on a she-camel, an umbrella
      shaded his head, and a turban was unfurled before him to supply
      the deficiency of a standard. His bravest disciples, who had been
      scattered by the storm, assembled round his person; and the
      equal, though various, merit of the Moslems was distinguished by
      the names of Mohagerians and Ansars, the fugitives of Mecca, and
      the auxiliaries of Medina. To eradicate the seeds of jealousy,
      Mahomet judiciously coupled his principal followers with the
      rights and obligations of brethren; and when Ali found himself
      without a peer, the prophet tenderly declared, that he would be
      the companion and brother of the noble youth. The expedient was
      crowned with success; the holy fraternity was respected in peace
      and war, and the two parties vied with each other in a generous
      emulation of courage and fidelity. Once only the concord was
      slightly ruffled by an accidental quarrel: a patriot of Medina
      arraigned the insolence of the strangers, but the hint of their
      expulsion was heard with abhorrence; and his own son most eagerly
      offered to lay at the apostle’s feet the head of his father.

      349, &c., tom. ii. p. 223 &c.)]

      From his establishment at Medina, Mahomet assumed the exercise of
      the regal and sacerdotal office; and it was impious to appeal
      from a judge whose decrees were inspired by the divine wisdom. A
      small portion of ground, the patrimony of two orphans, was
      acquired by gift or purchase; 121 on that chosen spot he built a
      house and a mosch, more venerable in their rude simplicity than
      the palaces and temples of the Assyrian caliphs. His seal of
      gold, or silver, was inscribed with the apostolic title; when he
      prayed and preached in the weekly assembly, he leaned against the
      trunk of a palm-tree; and it was long before he indulged himself
      in the use of a chair or pulpit of rough timber. 122 After a
      reign of six years, fifteen hundred Moslems, in arms and in the
      field, renewed their oath of allegiance; and their chief repeated
      the assurance of protection till the death of the last member, or
      the final dissolution of the party. It was in the same camp that
      the deputy of Mecca was astonished by the attention of the
      faithful to the words and looks of the prophet, by the eagerness
      with which they collected his spittle, a hair that dropped on the
      ground, the refuse water of his lustrations, as if they
      participated in some degree of the prophetic virtue. “I have
      seen,” said he, “the Chosroes of Persia and the Caesar of Rome,
      but never did I behold a king among his subjects like Mahomet
      among his companions.” The devout fervor of enthusiasm acts with
      more energy and truth than the cold and formal servility of
      courts.

      deceived by the word Al Nagjar, which signifies, in this place,
      not an obscure trade, but a noble tribe of Arabs. The desolate
      state of the ground is described by Abulfeda; and his worthy
      interpreter has proved, from Al Bochari, the offer of a price;
      from Al Jannabi, the fair purchase; and from Ahmeq Ben Joseph,

      grounds the prophet must be honorably acquitted.]

      describes the seal and pulpit, as two venerable relics of the

      In the state of nature, every man has a right to defend, by force
      of arms, his person and his possessions; to repel, or even to
      prevent, the violence of his enemies, and to extend his
      hostilities to a reasonable measure of satisfaction and
      retaliation. In the free society of the Arabs, the duties of
      subject and citizen imposed a feeble restraint; and Mahomet, in
      the exercise of a peaceful and benevolent mission, had been
      despoiled and banished by the injustice of his countrymen. The
      choice of an independent people had exalted the fugitive of Mecca
      to the rank of a sovereign; and he was invested with the just
      prerogative of forming alliances, and of waging offensive or
      defensive war. The imperfection of human rights was supplied and
      armed by the plenitude of divine power: the prophet of Medina
      assumed, in his new revelations, a fiercer and more sanguinary
      tone, which proves that his former moderation was the effect of
      weakness: 123 the means of persuasion had been tried, the season
      of forbearance was elapsed, and he was now commanded to propagate
      his religion by the sword, to destroy the monuments of idolatry,
      and, without regarding the sanctity of days or months, to pursue
      the unbelieving nations of the earth. The same bloody precepts,
      so repeatedly inculcated in the Koran, are ascribed by the author
      to the Pentateuch and the Gospel. But the mild tenor of the
      evangelic style may explain an ambiguous text, that Jesus did not
      bring peace on the earth, but a sword: his patient and humble
      virtues should not be confounded with the intolerant zeal of
      princes and bishops, who have disgraced the name of his
      disciples. In the prosecution of religious war, Mahomet might
      appeal with more propriety to the example of Moses, of the
      Judges, and the kings of Israel. The military laws of the Hebrews
      are still more rigid than those of the Arabian legislator. 124
      The Lord of hosts marched in person before the Jews: if a city
      resisted their summons, the males, without distinction, were put
      to the sword: the seven nations of Canaan were devoted to
      destruction; and neither repentance nor conversion, could shield
      them from the inevitable doom, that no creature within their
      precincts should be left alive. 1241 The fair option of
      friendship, or submission, or battle, was proposed to the enemies
      of Mahomet. If they professed the creed of Islam, they were
      admitted to all the temporal and spiritual benefits of his
      primitive disciples, and marched under the same banner to extend
      the religion which they had embraced. The clemency of the prophet
      was decided by his interest: yet he seldom trampled on a
      prostrate enemy; and he seems to promise, that on the payment of
      a tribute, the least guilty of his unbelieving subjects might be
      indulged in their worship, or at least in their imperfect faith.
      In the first months of his reign he practised the lessons of holy
      warfare, and displayed his white banner before the gates of
      Medina: the martial apostle fought in person at nine battles or
      sieges; 125 and fifty enterprises of war were achieved in ten
      years by himself or his lieutenants. The Arab continued to unite
      the professions of a merchant and a robber; and his petty
      excursions for the defence or the attack of a caravan insensibly
      prepared his troops for the conquest of Arabia. The distribution
      of the spoil was regulated by a divine law: 126 the whole was
      faithfully collected in one common mass: a fifth of the gold and
      silver, the prisoners and cattle, the movables and immovables,
      was reserved by the prophet for pious and charitable uses; the
      remainder was shared in adequate portions by the soldiers who had
      obtained the victory or guarded the camp: the rewards of the
      slain devolved to their widows and orphans; and the increase of
      cavalry was encouraged by the allotment of a double share to the
      horse and to the man. From all sides the roving Arabs were
      allured to the standard of religion and plunder: the apostle
      sanctified the license of embracing the female captives as their
      wives or concubines, and the enjoyment of wealth and beauty was a
      feeble type of the joys of paradise prepared for the valiant
      martyrs of the faith. “The sword,” says Mahomet, “is the key of
      heaven and of hell; a drop of blood shed in the cause of God, a
      night spent in arms, is of more avail than two months of fasting
      or prayer: whosoever falls in battle, his sins are forgiven: at
      the day of judgment his wounds shall be resplendent as vermilion,
      and odoriferous as musk; and the loss of his limbs shall be
      supplied by the wings of angels and cherubim.” The intrepid souls
      of the Arabs were fired with enthusiasm: the picture of the
      invisible world was strongly painted on their imagination; and
      the death which they had always despised became an object of hope
      and desire. The Koran inculcates, in the most absolute sense, the
      tenets of fate and predestination, which would extinguish both
      industry and virtue, if the actions of man were governed by his
      speculative belief. Yet their influence in every age has exalted
      the courage of the Saracens and Turks. The first companions of
      Mahomet advanced to battle with a fearless confidence: there is
      no danger where there is no chance: they were ordained to perish
      in their beds; or they were safe and invulnerable amidst the
      darts of the enemy. 127

      Perhaps the Koreish would have been content with the dight of
      Mahomet, had they not been provoked and alarmed by the vengeance
      of an enemy, who could intercept their Syrian trade as it passed
      and repassed through the territory of Medina. Abu Sophian
      himself, with only thirty or forty followers, conducted a wealthy
      caravan of a thousand camels; the fortune or dexterity of his
      march escaped the vigilance of Mahomet; but the chief of the
      Koreish was informed that the holy robbers were placed in ambush
      to await his return. He despatched a messenger to his brethren of
      Mecca, and they were roused, by the fear of losing their
      merchandise and their provisions, unless they hastened to his
      relief with the military force of the city. The sacred band of
      Mahomet was formed of three hundred and thirteen Moslems, of whom
      seventy-seven were fugitives, and the rest auxiliaries; they
      mounted by turns a train of seventy camels, (the camels of
      Yathreb were formidable in war;) but such was the poverty of his
      first disciples, that only two could appear on horseback in the
      field. 128 In the fertile and famous vale of Beder, 129 three
      stations from Medina, he was informed by his scouts of the
      caravan that approached on one side; of the Koreish, one hundred
      horse, eight hundred and fifty foot, who advanced on the other.
      After a short debate, he sacrificed the prospect of wealth to the
      pursuit of glory and revenge, and a slight intrenchment was
      formed, to cover his troops, and a stream of fresh water, that
      glided through the valley. “O God,” he exclaimed, as the numbers
      of the Koreish descended from the hills, “O God, if these are
      destroyed, by whom wilt thou be worshipped on the earth?—Courage,
      my children; close your ranks; discharge your arrows, and the day
      is your own.” At these words he placed himself, with Abubeker, on
      a throne or pulpit, 130 and instantly demanded the succor of
      Gabriel and three thousand angels. His eye was fixed on the field
      of battle: the Mussulmans fainted and were pressed: in that
      decisive moment the prophet started from his throne, mounted his
      horse, and cast a handful of sand into the air: “Let their faces
      be covered with confusion.” Both armies heard the thunder of his
      voice: their fancy beheld the angelic warriors: 131 the Koreish
      trembled and fled: seventy of the bravest were slain; and seventy
      captives adorned the first victory of the faithful. The dead
      bodies of the Koreish were despoiled and insulted: two of the
      most obnoxious prisoners were punished with death; and the ransom
      of the others, four thousand drams of silver, compensated in some
      degree the escape of the caravan. But it was in vain that the
      camels of Abu Sophian explored a new road through the desert and
      along the Euphrates: they were overtaken by the diligence of the
      Mussulmans; and wealthy must have been the prize, if twenty
      thousand drams could be set apart for the fifth of the apostle.
      The resentment of the public and private loss stimulated Abu
      Sophian to collect a body of three thousand men, seven hundred of
      whom were armed with cuirasses, and two hundred were mounted on
      horseback; three thousand camels attended his march; and his wife
      Henda, with fifteen matrons of Mecca, incessantly sounded their
      timbrels to animate the troops, and to magnify the greatness of
      Hobal, the most popular deity of the Caaba. The standard of God
      and Mahomet was upheld by nine hundred and fifty believers: the
      disproportion of numbers was not more alarming than in the field
      of Beder; and their presumption of victory prevailed against the
      divine and human sense of the apostle. The second battle was
      fought on Mount Ohud, six miles to the north of Medina; 132 the
      Koreish advanced in the form of a crescent; and the right wing of
      cavalry was led by Caled, the fiercest and most successful of the
      Arabian warriors. The troops of Mahomet were skilfully posted on
      the declivity of the hill; and their rear was guarded by a
      detachment of fifty archers. The weight of their charge impelled
      and broke the centre of the idolaters: but in the pursuit they
      lost the advantage of their ground: the archers deserted their
      station: the Mussulmans were tempted by the spoil, disobeyed
      their general, and disordered their ranks. The intrepid Caled,
      wheeling his cavalry on their flank and rear, exclaimed, with a
      loud voice, that Mahomet was slain. He was indeed wounded in the
      face with a javelin: two of his teeth were shattered with a
      stone; yet, in the midst of tumult and dismay, he reproached the
      infidels with the murder of a prophet; and blessed the friendly
      hand that stanched his blood, and conveyed him to a place of
      safety. Seventy martyrs died for the sins of the people; they
      fell, said the apostle, in pairs, each brother embracing his
      lifeless companion; 133 their bodies were mangled by the inhuman
      females of Mecca; and the wife of Abu Sophian tasted the entrails
      of Hamza, the uncle of Mahomet. They might applaud their
      superstition, and satiate their fury; but the Mussulmans soon
      rallied in the field, and the Koreish wanted strength or courage
      to undertake the siege of Medina. It was attacked the ensuing
      year by an army of ten thousand enemies; and this third
      expedition is variously named from the nations, which marched
      under the banner of Abu Sophian, from the ditch which was drawn
      before the city, and a camp of three thousand Mussulmans. The
      prudence of Mahomet declined a general engagement: the valor of
      Ali was signalized in single combat; and the war was protracted
      twenty days, till the final separation of the confederates. A
      tempest of wind, rain, and hail, overturned their tents: their
      private quarrels were fomented by an insidious adversary; and the
      Koreish, deserted by their allies, no longer hoped to subvert the
      throne, or to check the conquests, of their invincible exile. 134

      Chapter L: Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants.—Part VI.

      The choice of Jerusalem for the first kebla of prayer discovers
      the early propensity of Mahomet in favor of the Jews; and happy
      would it have been for their temporal interest, had they
      recognized, in the Arabian prophet, the hope of Israel and the
      promised Messiah. Their obstinacy converted his friendship into
      implacable hatred, with which he pursued that unfortunate people
      to the last moment of his life; and in the double character of an
      apostle and a conqueror, his persecution was extended to both
      worlds. 135 The Kainoka dwelt at Medina under the protection of
      the city; he seized the occasion of an accidental tumult, and
      summoned them to embrace his religion, or contend with him in
      battle. “Alas!” replied the trembling Jews, “we are ignorant of
      the use of arms, but we persevere in the faith and worship of our
      fathers; why wilt thou reduce us to the necessity of a just
      defence?” The unequal conflict was terminated in fifteen days;
      and it was with extreme reluctance that Mahomet yielded to the
      importunity of his allies, and consented to spare the lives of
      the captives. But their riches were confiscated, their arms
      became more effectual in the hands of the Mussulmans; and a
      wretched colony of seven hundred exiles was driven, with their
      wives and children, to implore a refuge on the confines of Syria.
      The Nadhirites were more guilty, since they conspired, in a
      friendly interview, to assassinate the prophet. He besieged their
      castle, three miles from Medina; but their resolute defence
      obtained an honorable capitulation; and the garrison, sounding
      their trumpets and beating their drums, was permitted to depart
      with the honors of war. The Jews had excited and joined the war
      of the Koreish: no sooner had the nations retired from the ditch,
      than Mahomet, without laying aside his armor, marched on the same
      day to extirpate the hostile race of the children of Koraidha.
      After a resistance of twenty-five days, they surrendered at
      discretion. They trusted to the intercession of their old allies
      of Medina; they could not be ignorant that fanaticism obliterates
      the feelings of humanity. A venerable elder, to whose judgment
      they appealed, pronounced the sentence of their death; seven
      hundred Jews were dragged in chains to the market-place of the
      city; they descended alive into the grave prepared for their
      execution and burial; and the apostle beheld with an inflexible
      eye the slaughter of his helpless enemies. Their sheep and camels
      were inherited by the Mussulmans: three hundred cuirasses, five
      hundred pikes, a thousand lances, composed the most useful
      portion of the spoil. Six days’ journey to the north-east of
      Medina, the ancient and wealthy town of Chaibar was the seat of
      the Jewish power in Arabia: the territory, a fertile spot in the
      desert, was covered with plantations and cattle, and protected by
      eight castles, some of which were esteemed of impregnable
      strength. The forces of Mahomet consisted of two hundred horse
      and fourteen hundred foot: in the succession of eight regular and
      painful sieges they were exposed to danger, and fatigue, and
      hunger; and the most undaunted chiefs despaired of the event. The
      apostle revived their faith and courage by the example of Ali, on
      whom he bestowed the surname of the Lion of God: perhaps we may
      believe that a Hebrew champion of gigantic stature was cloven to
      the chest by his irresistible cimeter; but we cannot praise the
      modesty of romance, which represents him as tearing from its
      hinges the gate of a fortress and wielding the ponderous buckler
      in his left hand. 136 After the reduction of the castles, the
      town of Chaibar submitted to the yoke. The chief of the tribe was
      tortured, in the presence of Mahomet, to force a confession of
      his hidden treasure: the industry of the shepherds and husbandmen
      was rewarded with a precarious toleration: they were permitted,
      so long as it should please the conqueror, to improve their
      patrimony, in equal shares, for his emolument and their own.
      Under the reign of Omar, the Jews of Chaibar were transported to
      Syria; and the caliph alleged the injunction of his dying master;
      that one and the true religion should be professed in his native
      land of Arabia. 137

      135 (return) [ The wars of Mahomet against the Jewish tribes of
      Kainoka, the Nadhirites, Koraidha, and Chaibar, are related by
      Abulfeda (p. 61, 71, 77, 87, &c.) and Gagnier, (tom. ii. p.
      61-65, 107-112, 139-148, 268-294.)]

      136 (return) [ Abu Rafe, the servant of Mahomet, is said to
      affirm that he himself, and seven other men, afterwards tried,
      without success, to move the same gate from the ground,
      (Abulfeda, p. 90.) Abu Rafe was an eye-witness, but who will be
      witness for Abu Rafe?]

      137 (return) [ The banishment of the Jews is attested by Elmacin
      (Hist. Saracen, p. 9) and the great Al Zabari, (Gagnier, tom. ii.
      p. 285.) Yet Niebuhr (Description de l’Arabie, p. 324) believes
      that the Jewish religion, and Karaite sect, are still professed
      by the tribe of Chaibar; and that, in the plunder of the
      caravans, the disciples of Moses are the confederates of those of
      Mahomet.]

      Five times each day the eyes of Mahomet were turned towards
      Mecca, 138 and he was urged by the most sacred and powerful
      motives to revisit, as a conqueror, the city and the temple from
      whence he had been driven as an exile. The Caaba was present to
      his waking and sleeping fancy: an idle dream was translated into
      vision and prophecy; he unfurled the holy banner; and a rash
      promise of success too hastily dropped from the lips of the
      apostle. His march from Medina to Mecca displayed the peaceful
      and solemn pomp of a pilgrimage: seventy camels, chosen and
      bedecked for sacrifice, preceded the van; the sacred territory
      was respected; and the captives were dismissed without ransom to
      proclaim his clemency and devotion. But no sooner did Mahomet
      descend into the plain, within a day’s journey of the city, than
      he exclaimed, “They have clothed themselves with the skins of
      tigers:” the numbers and resolution of the Koreish opposed his
      progress; and the roving Arabs of the desert might desert or
      betray a leader whom they had followed for the hopes of spoil.
      The intrepid fanatic sunk into a cool and cautious politician: he
      waived in the treaty his title of apostle of God; concluded with
      the Koreish and their allies a truce of ten years; engaged to
      restore the fugitives of Mecca who should embrace his religion;
      and stipulated only, for the ensuing year, the humble privilege
      of entering the city as a friend, and of remaining three days to
      accomplish the rites of the pilgrimage. A cloud of shame and
      sorrow hung on the retreat of the Mussulmans, and their
      disappointment might justly accuse the failure of a prophet who
      had so often appealed to the evidence of success. The faith and
      hope of the pilgrims were rekindled by the prospect of Mecca:
      their swords were sheathed; 1381 seven times in the footsteps of
      the apostle they encompassed the Caaba: the Koreish had retired
      to the hills, and Mahomet, after the customary sacrifice,
      evacuated the city on the fourth day. The people was edified by
      his devotion; the hostile chiefs were awed, or divided, or
      seduced; and both Kaled and Amrou, the future conquerors of Syria
      and Egypt, most seasonably deserted the sinking cause of
      idolatry. The power of Mahomet was increased by the submission of
      the Arabian tribes; ten thousand soldiers were assembled for the
      conquest of Mecca; and the idolaters, the weaker party, were
      easily convicted of violating the truce. Enthusiasm and
      discipline impelled the march, and preserved the secret till the
      blaze of ten thousand fires proclaimed to the astonished Koreish
      the design, the approach, and the irresistible force of the
      enemy. The haughty Abu Sophian presented the keys of the city,
      admired the variety of arms and ensigns that passed before him in
      review; observed that the son of Abdallah had acquired a mighty
      kingdom, and confessed, under the cimeter of Omar, that he was
      the apostle of the true God. The return of Marius and Scylla was
      stained with the blood of the Romans: the revenge of Mahomet was
      stimulated by religious zeal, and his injured followers were
      eager to execute or to prevent the order of a massacre. Instead
      of indulging their passions and his own, 139 the victorious exile
      forgave the guilt, and united the factions, of Mecca. His troops,
      in three divisions, marched into the city: eight-and-twenty of
      the inhabitants were slain by the sword of Caled; eleven men and
      six women were proscribed by the sentence of Mahomet; but he
      blamed the cruelty of his lieutenant; and several of the most
      obnoxious victims were indebted for their lives to his clemency
      or contempt. The chiefs of the Koreish were prostrate at his
      feet. “What mercy can you expect from the man whom you have
      wronged?” “We confide in the generosity of our kinsman.” “And you
      shall not confide in vain: begone! you are safe, you are free”
      The people of Mecca deserved their pardon by the profession of
      Islam; and after an exile of seven years, the fugitive missionary
      was enthroned as the prince and prophet of his native country.
      140 But the three hundred and sixty idols of the Caaba were
      ignominiously broken: the house of God was purified and adorned:
      as an example to future times, the apostle again fulfilled the
      duties of a pilgrim; and a perpetual law was enacted that no
      unbeliever should dare to set his foot on the territory of the
      holy city. 141

      139 (return) [ After the conquest of Mecca, the Mahomet of
      Voltaire imagines and perpetuates the most horrid crimes. The
      poet confesses, that he is not supported by the truth of history,
      and can only allege, que celui qui fait la guerre a sa patrie au
      nom de Dieu, est capable de tout, (Oeuvres de Voltaire, tom. xv.
      p. 282.) The maxim is neither charitable nor philosophic; and
      some reverence is surely due to the fame of heroes and the
      religion of nations. I am informed that a Turkish ambassador at
      Paris was much scandalized at the representation of this
      tragedy.]

      140 (return) [ The Mahometan doctors still dispute, whether Mecca
      was reduced by force or consent, (Abulfeda, p. 107, et Gagnier ad
      locum;) and this verbal controversy is of as much moment as our
      own about William the Conqueror.]

      141 (return) [ In excluding the Christians from the peninsula of
      Arabia, the province of Hejaz, or the navigation of the Red Sea,
      Chardin (Voyages en Perse, tom. iv. p. 166) and Reland
      (Dissertat. Miscell. tom. iii. p. 61) are more rigid than the
      Mussulmans themselves. The Christians are received without
      scruple into the ports of Mocha, and even of Gedda; and it is
      only the city and precincts of Mecca that are inaccessible to the
      profane, (Niebuhr, Description de l’Arabie, p. 308, 309, Voyage
      en Arabie, tom. i. p. 205, 248, &c.)]

      The conquest of Mecca determined the faith and obedience of the
      Arabian tribes; 142 who, according to the vicissitudes of
      fortune, had obeyed, or disregarded, the eloquence or the arms of
      the prophet. Indifference for rites and opinions still marks the
      character of the Bedoweens; and they might accept, as loosely as
      they hold, the doctrine of the Koran. Yet an obstinate remnant
      still adhered to the religion and liberty of their ancestors, and
      the war of Honain derived a proper appellation from the idols,
      whom Mahomet had vowed to destroy, and whom the confederates of
      Tayef had sworn to defend. 143 Four thousand Pagans advanced with
      secrecy and speed to surprise the conqueror: they pitied and
      despised the supine negligence of the Koreish, but they depended
      on the wishes, and perhaps the aid, of a people who had so lately
      renounced their gods, and bowed beneath the yoke of their enemy.
      The banners of Medina and Mecca were displayed by the prophet; a
      crowd of Bedoweens increased the strength or numbers of the army,
      and twelve thousand Mussulmans entertained a rash and sinful
      presumption of their invincible strength. They descended without
      precaution into the valley of Honain: the heights had been
      occupied by the archers and slingers of the confederates; their
      numbers were oppressed, their discipline was confounded, their
      courage was appalled, and the Koreish smiled at their impending
      destruction. The prophet, on his white mule, was encompassed by
      the enemies: he attempted to rush against their spears in search
      of a glorious death: ten of his faithful companions interposed
      their weapons and their breasts; three of these fell dead at his
      feet: “O my brethren,” he repeatedly cried, with sorrow and
      indignation, “I am the son of Abdallah, I am the apostle of
      truth! O man, stand fast in the faith! O God, send down thy
      succor!” His uncle Abbas, who, like the heroes of Homer, excelled
      in the loudness of his voice, made the valley resound with the
      recital of the gifts and promises of God: the flying Moslems
      returned from all sides to the holy standard; and Mahomet
      observed with pleasure that the furnace was again rekindled: his
      conduct and example restored the battle, and he animated his
      victorious troops to inflict a merciless revenge on the authors
      of their shame. From the field of Honain, he marched without
      delay to the siege of Tayef, sixty miles to the south-east of
      Mecca, a fortress of strength, whose fertile lands produce the
      fruits of Syria in the midst of the Arabian desert. A friendly
      tribe, instructed (I know not how) in the art of sieges, supplied
      him with a train of battering-rams and military engines, with a
      body of five hundred artificers. But it was in vain that he
      offered freedom to the slaves of Tayef; that he violated his own
      laws by the extirpation of the fruit-trees; that the ground was
      opened by the miners; that the breach was assaulted by the
      troops. After a siege of twenty-days, the prophet sounded a
      retreat; but he retreated with a song of devout triumph, and
      affected to pray for the repentance and safety of the unbelieving
      city. The spoils of this fortunate expedition amounted to six
      thousand captives, twenty-four thousand camels, forty thousand
      sheep, and four thousand ounces of silver: a tribe who had fought
      at Hoinan redeemed their prisoners by the sacrifice of their
      idols; but Mahomet compensated the loss, by resigning to the
      soldiers his fifth of the plunder, and wished, for their sake,
      that he possessed as many head of cattle as there were trees in
      the province of Tehama. Instead of chastising the disaffection of
      the Koreish, he endeavored to cut out their tongues, (his own
      expression,) and to secure their attachment by a superior measure
      of liberality: Abu Sophian alone was presented with three hundred
      camels and twenty ounces of silver; and Mecca was sincerely
      converted to the profitable religion of the Koran.

      are related by Abulfeda (p. 117-123) and Gagnier, (tom. iii. p.
      88-111.) It is Al Jannabi who mentions the engines and engineers
      of the tribe of Daws. The fertile spot of Tayef was supposed to
      be a piece of the land of Syria detached and dropped in the
      general deluge]

      The fugitives and auxiliaries complained, that they who had borne
      the burden were neglected in the season of victory “Alas!”
      replied their artful leader, “suffer me to conciliate these
      recent enemies, these doubtful proselytes, by the gift of some
      perishable goods. To your guard I intrust my life and fortunes.
      You are the companions of my exile, of my kingdom, of my
      paradise.” He was followed by the deputies of Tayef, who dreaded
      the repetition of a siege. “Grant us, O apostle of God! a truce
      of three years, with the toleration of our ancient worship.” “Not
      a month, not an hour.” “Excuse us at least from the obligation of
      prayer.” “Without prayer religion is of no avail.” They submitted
      in silence: their temples were demolished, and the same sentence
      of destruction was executed on all the idols of Arabia. His
      lieutenants, on the shores of the Red Sea, the Ocean, and the
      Gulf of Persia, were saluted by the acclamations of a faithful
      people; and the ambassadors, who knelt before the throne of
      Medina, were as numerous (says the Arabian proverb) as the dates
      that fall from the maturity of a palm-tree. The nation submitted
      to the God and the sceptre of Mahomet: the opprobrious name of
      tribute was abolished: the spontaneous or reluctant oblations of
      arms and tithes were applied to the service of religion; and one
      hundred and fourteen thousand Moslems accompanied the last
      pilgrimage of the apostle. 144

      144 (return) [ The last conquests and pilgrimage of Mahomet are
      contained in Abulfeda, (p. 121, 133,) Gagnier, (tom. iii. p.
      119-219,) Elmacin, (p. 10, 11,) Abulpharagius, (p. 103.) The ixth
      of the Hegira was styled the Year of Embassies, (Gagnier, Not. ad
      Abulfed. p. 121.)]

      When Heraclius returned in triumph from the Persian war, he
      entertained, at Emesa, one of the ambassadors of Mahomet, who
      invited the princes and nations of the earth to the profession of
      Islam. On this foundation the zeal of the Arabians has supposed
      the secret conversion of the Christian emperor: the vanity of the
      Greeks has feigned a personal visit of the prince of Medina, who
      accepted from the royal bounty a rich domain, and a secure
      retreat, in the province of Syria. 145 But the friendship of
      Heraclius and Mahomet was of short continuance: the new religion
      had inflamed rather than assuaged the rapacious spirit of the
      Saracens, and the murder of an envoy afforded a decent pretence
      for invading, with three thousand soldiers, the territory of
      Palestine, that extends to the eastward of the Jordan. The holy
      banner was intrusted to Zeid; and such was the discipline or
      enthusiasm of the rising sect, that the noblest chiefs served
      without reluctance under the slave of the prophet. On the event
      of his decease, Jaafar and Abdallah were successively substituted
      to the command; and if the three should perish in the war, the
      troops were authorized to elect their general. The three leaders
      were slain in the battle of Muta, 146 the first military action,
      which tried the valor of the Moslems against a foreign enemy.
      Zeid fell, like a soldier, in the foremost ranks: the death of
      Jaafar was heroic and memorable: he lost his right hand: he
      shifted the standard to his left: the left was severed from his
      body: he embraced the standard with his bleeding stumps, till he
      was transfixed to the ground with fifty honorable wounds. 1461
      “Advance,” cried Abdallah, who stepped into the vacant place,
      “advance with confidence: either victory or paradise is our own.”
      The lance of a Roman decided the alternative; but the falling
      standard was rescued by Caled, the proselyte of Mecca: nine
      swords were broken in his hand; and his valor withstood and
      repulsed the superior numbers of the Christians. In the nocturnal
      council of the camp he was chosen to command: his skilful
      evolutions of the ensuing day secured either the victory or the
      retreat of the Saracens; and Caled is renowned among his brethren
      and his enemies by the glorious appellation of the Sword of God.
      In the pulpit, Mahomet described, with prophetic rapture, the
      crowns of the blessed martyrs; but in private he betrayed the
      feelings of human nature: he was surprised as he wept over the
      daughter of Zeid: “What do I see?” said the astonished votary.
      “You see,” replied the apostle, “a friend who is deploring the
      loss of his most faithful friend.” After the conquest of Mecca,
      the sovereign of Arabia affected to prevent the hostile
      preparations of Heraclius; and solemnly proclaimed war against
      the Romans, without attempting to disguise the hardships and
      dangers of the enterprise. 147 The Moslems were discouraged: they
      alleged the want of money, or horses, or provisions; the season
      of harvest, and the intolerable heat of the summer: “Hell is much
      hotter,” said the indignant prophet. He disdained to compel their
      service: but on his return he admonished the most guilty, by an
      excommunication of fifty days. Their desertion enhanced the merit
      of Abubeker, Othman, and the faithful companions who devoted
      their lives and fortunes; and Mahomet displayed his banner at the
      head of ten thousand horse and twenty thousand foot. Painful
      indeed was the distress of the march: lassitude and thirst were
      aggravated by the scorching and pestilential winds of the desert:
      ten men rode by turns on one camel; and they were reduced to the
      shameful necessity of drinking the water from the belly of that
      useful animal. In the mid-way, ten days’ journey from Medina and
      Damascus, they reposed near the grove and fountain of Tabuc.
      Beyond that place Mahomet declined the prosecution of the war: he
      declared himself satisfied with the peaceful intentions, he was
      more probably daunted by the martial array, of the emperor of the
      East. But the active and intrepid Caled spread around the terror
      of his name; and the prophet received the submission of the
      tribes and cities, from the Euphrates to Ailah, at the head of
      the Red Sea. To his Christian subjects, Mahomet readily granted
      the security of their persons, the freedom of their trade, the
      property of their goods, and the toleration of their worship. 148
      The weakness of their Arabian brethren had restrained them from
      opposing his ambition; the disciples of Jesus were endeared to
      the enemy of the Jews; and it was the interest of a conqueror to
      propose a fair capitulation to the most powerful religion of the
      earth.

      to believe it spurious. Yet Abulpharagius quotes the impostor’s

      Till the age of sixty-three years, the strength of Mahomet was
      equal to the temporal and spiritual fatigues of his mission. His
      epileptic fits, an absurd calumny of the Greeks, would be an
      object of pity rather than abhorrence; 149 but he seriously
      believed that he was poisoned at Chaibar by the revenge of a
      Jewish female. 150 During four years, the health of the prophet
      declined; his infirmities increased; but his mortal disease was a
      fever of fourteen days, which deprived him by intervals of the
      use of reason. As soon as he was conscious of his danger, he
      edified his brethren by the humility of his virtue or penitence.
      “If there be any man,” said the apostle from the pulpit, “whom I
      have unjustly scourged, I submit my own back to the lash of
      retaliation. Have I aspersed the reputation of a Mussulman? let
      him proclaim my thoughts in the face of the congregation. Has any
      one been despoiled of his goods? the little that I possess shall
      compensate the principal and the interest of the debt.” “Yes,”
      replied a voice from the crowd, “I am entitled to three drams of
      silver.” Mahomet heard the complaint, satisfied the demand, and
      thanked his creditor for accusing him in this world rather than
      at the day of judgment. He beheld with temperate firmness the
      approach of death; enfranchised his slaves (seventeen men, as
      they are named, and eleven women;) minutely directed the order of
      his funeral, and moderated the lamentations of his weeping
      friends, on whom he bestowed the benediction of peace. Till the
      third day before his death, he regularly performed the function
      of public prayer: the choice of Abubeker to supply his place,
      appeared to mark that ancient and faithful friend as his
      successor in the sacerdotal and regal office; but he prudently
      declined the risk and envy of a more explicit nomination. At a
      moment when his faculties were visibly impaired, he called for
      pen and ink to write, or, more properly, to dictate, a divine
      book, the sum and accomplishment of all his revelations: a
      dispute arose in the chamber, whether he should be allowed to
      supersede the authority of the Koran; and the prophet was forced
      to reprove the indecent vehemence of his disciples. If the
      slightest credit may be afforded to the traditions of his wives
      and companions, he maintained, in the bosom of his family, and to
      the last moments of his life, the dignity 1501 of an apostle, and
      the faith of an enthusiast; described the visits of Gabriel, who
      bade an everlasting farewell to the earth, and expressed his
      lively confidence, not only of the mercy, but of the favor, of
      the Supreme Being. In a familiar discourse he had mentioned his
      special prerogative, that the angel of death was not allowed to
      take his soul till he had respectfully asked the permission of
      the prophet. The request was granted; and Mahomet immediately
      fell into the agony of his dissolution: his head was reclined on
      the lap of Ayesha, the best beloved of all his wives; he fainted
      with the violence of pain; recovering his spirits, he raised his
      eyes towards the roof of the house, and, with a steady look,
      though a faltering voice, uttered the last broken, though
      articulate, words: “O God!..... pardon my sins....... Yes, ......
      I come,...... among my fellow-citizens on high;” and thus
      peaceably expired on a carpet spread upon the floor. An
      expedition for the conquest of Syria was stopped by this mournful
      event; the army halted at the gates of Medina; the chiefs were
      assembled round their dying master. The city, more especially the
      house, of the prophet, was a scene of clamorous sorrow of silent
      despair: fanaticism alone could suggest a ray of hope and
      consolation. “How can he be dead, our witness, our intercessor,
      our mediator, with God? By God he is not dead: like Moses and
      Jesus, he is wrapped in a holy trance, and speedily will he
      return to his faithful people.” The evidence of sense was
      disregarded; and Omar, unsheathing his cimeter, threatened to
      strike off the heads of the infidels, who should dare to affirm
      that the prophet was no more. The tumult was appeased by the
      weight and moderation of Abubeker. “Is it Mahomet,” said he to
      Omar and the multitude, “or the God of Mahomet, whom you worship?
      The God of Mahomet liveth forever; but the apostle was a mortal
      like ourselves, and according to his own prediction, he has
      experienced the common fate of mortality.” He was piously
      interred by the hands of his nearest kinsman, on the same spot on
      which he expired: 151 Medina has been sanctified by the death and
      burial of Mahomet; and the innumerable pilgrims of Mecca often
      turn aside from the way, to bow, in voluntary devotion, 152
      before the simple tomb of the prophet. 153

      sarcastic remark, that in herself, or any of her family, a
      similar demeanor would long since have incurred his severe
      displeasure. * * * He said that the acuteness and violence of his

      loadstones, (Dictionnaire de Bayle, Mahomet, Rem. Ee. Ff.)

      mistake; for the 6th June of that year was a Saturday, not a
      Monday; the 8th June, therefore, was a Monday. It is easy to

      interesting circumstances were originally received from Ayesha,
      Ali, the sons of Abbas, &c.; and as they dwelt at Medina, and
      survived the prophet many years, they might repeat the pious tale
      to a second or third generation of pilgrims.]

      At the conclusion of the life of Mahomet, it may perhaps be
      expected, that I should balance his faults and virtues, that I
      should decide whether the title of enthusiast or impostor more
      properly belongs to that extraordinary man. Had I been intimately
      conversant with the son of Abdallah, the task would still be
      difficult, and the success uncertain: at the distance of twelve
      centuries, I darkly contemplate his shade through a cloud of
      religious incense; and could I truly delineate the portrait of an
      hour, the fleeting resemblance would not equally apply to the
      solitary of Mount Hera, to the preacher of Mecca, and to the
      conqueror of Arabia. The author of a mighty revolution appears to
      have been endowed with a pious and contemplative disposition: so
      soon as marriage had raised him above the pressure of want, he
      avoided the paths of ambition and avarice; and till the age of
      forty he lived with innocence, and would have died without a
      name. The unity of God is an idea most congenial to nature and
      reason; and a slight conversation with the Jews and Christians
      would teach him to despise and detest the idolatry of Mecca. It
      was the duty of a man and a citizen to impart the doctrine of
      salvation, to rescue his country from the dominion of sin and
      error. The energy of a mind incessantly bent on the same object,
      would convert a general obligation into a particular call; the
      warm suggestions of the understanding or the fancy would be felt
      as the inspirations of Heaven; the labor of thought would expire
      in rapture and vision; and the inward sensation, the invisible
      monitor, would be described with the form and attributes of an
      angel of God. 154 From enthusiasm to imposture, the step is
      perilous and slippery: the daemon of Socrates 155 affords a
      memorable instance, how a wise man may deceive himself, how a
      good man may deceive others, how the conscience may slumber in a
      mixed and middle state between self-illusion and voluntary fraud.
      Charity may believe that the original motives of Mahomet were
      those of pure and genuine benevolence; but a human missionary is
      incapable of cherishing the obstinate unbelievers who reject his
      claims despise his arguments, and persecute his life; he might
      forgive his personal adversaries, he may lawfully hate the
      enemies of God; the stern passions of pride and revenge were
      kindled in the bosom of Mahomet, and he sighed, like the prophet
      of Nineveh, for the destruction of the rebels whom he had
      condemned. The injustice of Mecca and the choice of Medina,
      transformed the citizen into a prince, the humble preacher into
      the leader of armies; but his sword was consecrated by the
      example of the saints; and the same God who afflicts a sinful
      world with pestilence and earthquakes, might inspire for their
      conversion or chastisement the valor of his servants. In the
      exercise of political government, he was compelled to abate of
      the stern rigor of fanaticism, to comply in some measure with the
      prejudices and passions of his followers, and to employ even the
      vices of mankind as the instruments of their salvation. The use
      of fraud and perfidy, of cruelty and injustice, were often
      subservient to the propagation of the faith; and Mahomet
      commanded or approved the assassination of the Jews and idolaters
      who had escaped from the field of battle. By the repetition of
      such acts, the character of Mahomet must have been gradually
      stained; and the influence of such pernicious habits would be
      poorly compensated by the practice of the personal and social
      virtues which are necessary to maintain the reputation of a
      prophet among his sectaries and friends. Of his last years,
      ambition was the ruling passion; and a politician will suspect,
      that he secretly smiled (the victorious impostor!) at the
      enthusiasm of his youth, and the credulity of his proselytes. 156
      A philosopher will observe, that their credulity and his success
      would tend more strongly to fortify the assurance of his divine
      mission, that his interest and religion were inseparably
      connected, and that his conscience would be soothed by the
      persuasion, that he alone was absolved by the Deity from the
      obligation of positive and moral laws. If he retained any vestige
      of his native innocence, the sins of Mahomet may be allowed as an
      evidence of his sincerity. In the support of truth, the arts of
      fraud and fiction may be deemed less criminal; and he would have
      started at the foulness of the means, had he not been satisfied
      of the importance and justice of the end. Even in a conqueror or
      a priest, I can surprise a word or action of unaffected humanity;
      and the decree of Mahomet, that, in the sale of captives, the
      mothers should never be separated from their children, may
      suspend, or moderate, the censure of the historian. 157

      Chapter L: Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants.—Part VII.

      The good sense of Mahomet 158 despised the pomp of royalty: the
      apostle of God submitted to the menial offices of the family: he
      kindled the fire, swept the floor, milked the ewes, and mended
      with his own hands his shoes and his woollen garment. Disdaining
      the penance and merit of a hermit, he observed, without effort or
      vanity, the abstemious diet of an Arab and a soldier. On solemn
      occasions he feasted his companions with rustic and hospitable
      plenty; but in his domestic life, many weeks would elapse without
      a fire being kindled on the hearth of the prophet. The
      interdiction of wine was confirmed by his example; his hunger was
      appeased with a sparing allowance of barley-bread: he delighted
      in the taste of milk and honey; but his ordinary food consisted
      of dates and water. Perfumes and women were the two sensual
      enjoyments which his nature required, and his religion did not
      forbid; and Mahomet affirmed, that the fervor of his devotion was
      increased by these innocent pleasures. The heat of the climate
      inflames the blood of the Arabs; and their libidinous complexion
      has been noticed by the writers of antiquity. 159 Their
      incontinence was regulated by the civil and religious laws of the
      Koran: their incestuous alliances were blamed; the boundless
      license of polygamy was reduced to four legitimate wives or
      concubines; their rights both of bed and of dowry were equitably
      determined; the freedom of divorce was discouraged, adultery was
      condemned as a capital offence; and fornication, in either sex,
      was punished with a hundred stripes. 160 Such were the calm and
      rational precepts of the legislator: but in his private conduct,
      Mahomet indulged the appetites of a man, and abused the claims of
      a prophet. A special revelation dispensed him from the laws which
      he had imposed on his nation: the female sex, without reserve,
      was abandoned to his desires; and this singular prerogative
      excited the envy, rather than the scandal, the veneration, rather
      than the envy, of the devout Mussulmans. If we remember the seven
      hundred wives and three hundred concubines of the wise Solomon,
      we shall applaud the modesty of the Arabian, who espoused no more
      than seventeen or fifteen wives; eleven are enumerated who
      occupied at Medina their separate apartments round the house of
      the apostle, and enjoyed in their turns the favor of his conjugal
      society. What is singular enough, they were all widows, excepting
      only Ayesha, the daughter of Abubeker. She was doubtless a
      virgin, since Mahomet consummated his nuptials (such is the
      premature ripeness of the climate) when she was only nine years
      of age. The youth, the beauty, the spirit of Ayesha, gave her a
      superior ascendant: she was beloved and trusted by the prophet;
      and, after his death, the daughter of Abubeker was long revered
      as the mother of the faithful. Her behavior had been ambiguous
      and indiscreet: in a nocturnal march she was accidentally left
      behind; and in the morning Ayesha returned to the camp with a
      man. The temper of Mahomet was inclined to jealousy; but a divine
      revelation assured him of her innocence: he chastised her
      accusers, and published a law of domestic peace, that no woman
      should be condemned unless four male witnesses had seen her in
      the act of adultery. 161 In his adventures with Zeineb, the wife
      of Zeid, and with Mary, an Egyptian captive, the amorous prophet
      forgot the interest of his reputation. At the house of Zeid, his
      freedman and adopted son, he beheld, in a loose undress, the
      beauty of Zeineb, and burst forth into an ejaculation of devotion
      and desire. The servile, or grateful, freedman understood the
      hint, and yielded without hesitation to the love of his
      benefactor. But as the filial relation had excited some doubt and
      scandal, the angel Gabriel descended from heaven to ratify the
      deed, to annul the adoption, and gently to reprove the apostle
      for distrusting the indulgence of his God. One of his wives,
      Hafna, the daughter of Omar, surprised him on her own bed, in the
      embraces of his Egyptian captive: she promised secrecy and
      forgiveness, he swore that he would renounce the possession of
      Mary. Both parties forgot their engagements; and Gabriel again
      descended with a chapter of the Koran, to absolve him from his
      oath, and to exhort him freely to enjoy his captives and
      concubines, without listening to the clamors of his wives. In a
      solitary retreat of thirty days, he labored, alone with Mary, to
      fulfil the commands of the angel. When his love and revenge were
      satiated, he summoned to his presence his eleven wives,
      reproached their disobedience and indiscretion, and threatened
      them with a sentence of divorce, both in this world and in the
      next; a dreadful sentence, since those who had ascended the bed
      of the prophet were forever excluded from the hope of a second
      marriage. Perhaps the incontinence of Mahomet may be palliated by
      the tradition of his natural or preternatural gifts; 162 he
      united the manly virtue of thirty of the children of Adam: and
      the apostle might rival the thirteenth labor 163 of the Grecian
      Hercules. 164 A more serious and decent excuse may be drawn from
      his fidelity to Cadijah. During the twenty-four years of their
      marriage, her youthful husband abstained from the right of
      polygamy, and the pride or tenderness of the venerable matron was
      never insulted by the society of a rival. After her death, he
      placed her in the rank of the four perfect women, with the sister
      of Moses, the mother of Jesus, and Fatima, the best beloved of
      his daughters. “Was she not old?” said Ayesha, with the insolence
      of a blooming beauty; “has not God given you a better in her
      place?” “No, by God,” said Mahomet, with an effusion of honest
      gratitude, “there never can be a better! She believed in me when
      men despised me; she relieved my wants, when I was poor and
      persecuted by the world.” 165

      In the largest indulgence of polygamy, the founder of a religion
      and empire might aspire to multiply the chances of a numerous
      posterity and a lineal succession. The hopes of Mahomet were
      fatally disappointed. The virgin Ayesha, and his ten widows of
      mature age and approved fertility, were barren in his potent
      embraces. The four sons of Cadijah died in their infancy. Mary,
      his Egyptian concubine, was endeared to him by the birth of
      Ibrahim. At the end of fifteen months the prophet wept over his
      grave; but he sustained with firmness the raillery of his
      enemies, and checked the adulation or credulity of the Moslems,
      by the assurance that an eclipse of the sun was not occasioned by
      the death of the infant. Cadijah had likewise given him four
      daughters, who were married to the most faithful of his
      disciples: the three eldest died before their father; but Fatima,
      who possessed his confidence and love, became the wife of her
      cousin Ali, and the mother of an illustrious progeny. The merit
      and misfortunes of Ali and his descendants will lead me to
      anticipate, in this place, the series of the Saracen caliphs, a
      title which describes the commanders of the faithful as the
      vicars and successors of the apostle of God. 166

      166 (return) [ This outline of the Arabian history is drawn from

      Aboubecre, Omar Othman, Ali, &c.;) from the Annals of Abulfeda,
      Abulpharagius, and Elmacin, (under the proper years of the
      Hegira,) and especially from Ockley’s History of the Saracens,
      (vol. i. p. 1-10, 115-122, 229, 249, 363-372, 378-391, and almost
      the whole of the second volume.) Yet we should weigh with caution
      the traditions of the hostile sects; a stream which becomes still
      more muddy as it flows farther from the source. Sir John Chardin
      has too faithfully copied the fables and errors of the modern
      Persians, (Voyages, tom. ii. p. 235-250, &c.)]

      The birth, the alliance, the character of Ali, which exalted him
      above the rest of his countrymen, might justify his claim to the
      vacant throne of Arabia. The son of Abu Taleb was, in his own
      right, the chief of the family of Hashem, and the hereditary
      prince or guardian of the city and temple of Mecca. The light of
      prophecy was extinct; but the husband of Fatima might expect the
      inheritance and blessing of her father: the Arabs had sometimes
      been patient of a female reign; and the two grandsons of the
      prophet had often been fondled in his lap, and shown in his
      pulpit as the hope of his age, and the chief of the youth of
      paradise. The first of the true believers might aspire to march
      before them in this world and in the next; and if some were of a
      graver and more rigid cast, the zeal and virtue of Ali were never
      outstripped by any recent proselyte. He united the qualifications
      of a poet, a soldier, and a saint: his wisdom still breathes in a
      collection of moral and religious sayings; 167 and every
      antagonist, in the combats of the tongue or of the sword, was
      subdued by his eloquence and valor. From the first hour of his
      mission to the last rites of his funeral, the apostle was never
      forsaken by a generous friend, whom he delighted to name his
      brother, his vicegerent, and the faithful Aaron of a second
      Moses. The son of Abu Taleb was afterwards reproached for
      neglecting to secure his interest by a solemn declaration of his
      right, which would have silenced all competition, and sealed his
      succession by the decrees of Heaven. But the unsuspecting hero
      confided in himself: the jealousy of empire, and perhaps the fear
      of opposition, might suspend the resolutions of Mahomet; and the
      bed of sickness was besieged by the artful Ayesha, the daughter
      of Abubeker, and the enemy of Ali. 1671

      167 (return) [ Ockley (at the end of his second volume) has given
      an English version of 169 sentences, which he ascribes, with some
      hesitation, to Ali, the son of Abu Taleb. His preface is colored
      by the enthusiasm of a translator; yet these sentences delineate
      a characteristic, though dark, picture of human life.]

      1671 (return) [ Gibbon wrote chiefly from the Arabic or Sunnite
      account of these transactions, the only sources accessible at the
      time when he composed his History. Major Price, writing from
      Persian authorities, affords us the advantage of comparing
      throughout what may be fairly considered the Shiite Version. The
      glory of Ali is the constant burden of their strain. He was
      destined, and, according to some accounts, designated, for the
      caliphate by the prophet; but while the others were fiercely
      pushing their own interests, Ali was watching the remains of
      Mahomet with pious fidelity. His disinterested magnanimity, on
      each separate occasion, declined the sceptre, and gave the noble
      example of obedience to the appointed caliph. He is described, in
      retirement, on the throne, and in the field of battle, as
      transcendently pious, magnanimous, valiant, and humane. He lost
      his empire through his excess of virtue and love for the faithful
      his life through his confidence in God, and submission to the
      decrees of fate. Compare the curious account of this apathy in
      Price, chapter ii. It is to be regretted, I must add, that Major
      Price has contented himself with quoting the names of the Persian
      works which he follows, without any account of their character,
      age, and authority.—M.]

      The silence and death of the prophet restored the liberty of the
      people; and his companions convened an assembly to deliberate on
      the choice of his successor. The hereditary claim and lofty
      spirit of Ali were offensive to an aristocracy of elders,
      desirous of bestowing and resuming the sceptre by a free and
      frequent election: the Koreish could never be reconciled to the
      proud preeminence of the line of Hashem; the ancient discord of
      the tribes was rekindled, the fugitives of Mecca and the
      auxiliaries of Medina asserted their respective merits; and the
      rash proposal of choosing two independent caliphs would have
      crushed in their infancy the religion and empire of the Saracens.
      The tumult was appeased by the disinterested resolution of Omar,
      who, suddenly renouncing his own pretensions, stretched forth his
      hand, and declared himself the first subject of the mild and
      venerable Abubeker. 1672 The urgency of the moment, and the
      acquiescence of the people, might excuse this illegal and
      precipitate measure; but Omar himself confessed from the pulpit,
      that if any Mulsulman should hereafter presume to anticipate the
      suffrage of his brethren, both the elector and the elected would
      be worthy of death. 168 After the simple inauguration of
      Abubeker, he was obeyed in Medina, Mecca, and the provinces of
      Arabia: the Hashemites alone declined the oath of fidelity; and
      their chief, in his own house, maintained, above six months, a
      sullen and independent reserve; without listening to the threats
      of Omar, who attempted to consume with fire the habitation of the
      daughter of the apostle. The death of Fatima, and the decline of
      his party, subdued the indignant spirit of Ali: he condescended
      to salute the commander of the faithful, accepted his excuse of
      the necessity of preventing their common enemies, and wisely
      rejected his courteous offer of abdicating the government of the
      Arabians. After a reign of two years, the aged caliph was
      summoned by the angel of death. In his testament, with the tacit
      approbation of his companions, he bequeathed the sceptre to the
      firm and intrepid virtue of Omar. “I have no occasion,” said the
      modest candidate, “for the place.” “But the place has occasion
      for you,” replied Abubeker; who expired with a fervent prayer,
      that the God of Mahomet would ratify his choice, and direct the
      Mussulmans in the way of concord and obedience. The prayer was
      not ineffectual, since Ali himself, in a life of privacy and
      prayer, professed to revere the superior worth and dignity of his
      rival; who comforted him for the loss of empire, by the most
      flattering marks of confidence and esteem. In the twelfth year of
      his reign, Omar received a mortal wound from the hand of an
      assassin: he rejected with equal impartiality the names of his
      son and of Ali, refused to load his conscience with the sins of
      his successor, and devolved on six of the most respectable
      companions the arduous task of electing a commander of the
      faithful. On this occasion, Ali was again blamed by his friends
      169 for submitting his right to the judgment of men, for
      recognizing their jurisdiction by accepting a place among the six
      electors. He might have obtained their suffrage, had he deigned
      to promise a strict and servile conformity, not only to the Koran
      and tradition, but likewise to the determinations of two seniors.
      170 With these limitations, Othman, the secretary of Mahomet,
      accepted the government; nor was it till after the third caliph,
      twenty-four years after the death of the prophet, that Ali was
      invested, by the popular choice, with the regal and sacerdotal
      office. The manners of the Arabians retained their primitive
      simplicity, and the son of Abu Taleb despised the pomp and vanity
      of this world. At the hour of prayer, he repaired to the mosch of
      Medina, clothed in a thin cotton gown, a coarse turban on his
      head, his slippers in one hand, and his bow in the other, instead
      of a walking-staff. The companions of the prophet, and the chiefs
      of the tribes, saluted their new sovereign, and gave him their
      right hands as a sign of fealty and allegiance.

      vers. Reiske;) and concludes, (p. 85,) O princeps fidelium,
      absque controversia tu quidem vere fortis es, at inops boni

      115. Ockley, tom. i. p. 371,) may signify not two actual
      counsellors, but his two predecessors, Abubeker and Omar.]

      The mischiefs that flow from the contests of ambition are usually
      confined to the times and countries in which they have been
      agitated. But the religious discord of the friends and enemies of
      Ali has been renewed in every age of the Hegira, and is still
      maintained in the immortal hatred of the Persians and Turks. 171
      The former, who are branded with the appellation of Shiites or
      sectaries, have enriched the Mahometan creed with a new article
      of faith; and if Mahomet be the apostle, his companion Ali is the
      vicar, of God. In their private converse, in their public
      worship, they bitterly execrate the three usurpers who
      intercepted his indefeasible right to the dignity of Imam and
      Caliph; and the name of Omar expresses in their tongue the
      perfect accomplishment of wickedness and impiety. 172 The
      Sonnites, who are supported by the general consent and orthodox
      tradition of the Mussulmans, entertain a more impartial, or at
      least a more decent, opinion. They respect the memory of
      Abubeker, Omar, Othman, and Ali, the holy and legitimate
      successors of the prophet. But they assign the last and most
      humble place to the husband of Fatima, in the persuasion that the
      order of succession was determined by the decrees of sanctity.
      173 An historian who balances the four caliphs with a hand
      unshaken by superstition, will calmly pronounce that their
      manners were alike pure and exemplary; that their zeal was
      fervent, and probably sincere; and that, in the midst of riches
      and power, their lives were devoted to the practice of moral and
      religious duties. But the public virtues of Abubeker and Omar,
      the prudence of the first, the severity of the second, maintained
      the peace and prosperity of their reigns. The feeble temper and
      declining age of Othman were incapable of sustaining the weight
      of conquest and empire. He chose, and he was deceived; he
      trusted, and he was betrayed: the most deserving of the faithful
      became useless or hostile to his government, and his lavish
      bounty was productive only of ingratitude and discontent. The
      spirit of discord went forth in the provinces: their deputies
      assembled at Medina; and the Charegites, the desperate fanatics
      who disclaimed the yoke of subordination and reason, were
      confounded among the free-born Arabs, who demanded the redress of
      their wrongs and the punishment of their oppressors. From Cufa,
      from Bassora, from Egypt, from the tribes of the desert, they
      rose in arms, encamped about a league from Medina, and despatched
      a haughty mandate to their sovereign, requiring him to execute
      justice, or to descend from the throne. His repentance began to
      disarm and disperse the insurgents; but their fury was rekindled
      by the arts of his enemies; and the forgery of a perfidious
      secretary was contrived to blast his reputation and precipitate
      his fall. The caliph had lost the only guard of his predecessors,
      the esteem and confidence of the Moslems: during a siege of six
      weeks his water and provisions were intercepted, and the feeble
      gates of the palace were protected only by the scruples of the
      more timorous rebels. Forsaken by those who had abused his
      simplicity, the hopeless and venerable caliph expected the
      approach of death: the brother of Ayesha marched at the head of
      the assassins; and Othman, with the Koran in his lap, was pierced
      with a multitude of wounds. 1731 A tumultuous anarchy of five
      days was appeased by the inauguration of Ali: his refusal would
      have provoked a general massacre. In this painful situation he
      supported the becoming pride of the chief of the Hashemites;
      declared that he had rather serve than reign; rebuked the
      presumption of the strangers; and required the formal, if not the
      voluntary, assent of the chiefs of the nation. He has never been
      accused of prompting the assassin of Omar; though Persia
      indiscreetly celebrates the festival of that holy martyr. The
      quarrel between Othman and his subjects was assuaged by the early
      mediation of Ali; and Hassan, the eldest of his sons, was
      insulted and wounded in the defence of the caliph. Yet it is
      doubtful whether the father of Hassan was strenuous and sincere
      in his opposition to the rebels; and it is certain that he
      enjoyed the benefit of their crime. The temptation was indeed of
      such magnitude as might stagger and corrupt the most obdurate
      virtue. The ambitious candidate no longer aspired to the barren
      sceptre of Arabia; the Saracens had been victorious in the East
      and West; and the wealthy kingdoms of Persia, Syria, and Egypt
      were the patrimony of the commander of the faithful.

      Chapter L: Description Of Arabia And Its Inhabitants.—Part VIII.

      A life of prayer and contemplation had not chilled the martial
      activity of Ali; but in a mature age, after a long experience of
      mankind, he still betrayed in his conduct the rashness and
      indiscretion of youth. 1732 In the first days of his reign, he
      neglected to secure, either by gifts or fetters, the doubtful
      allegiance of Telha and Zobeir, two of the most powerful of the
      Arabian chiefs. They escaped from Medina to Mecca, and from
      thence to Bassora; erected the standard of revolt; and usurped
      the government of Irak, or Assyria, which they had vainly
      solicited as the reward of their services. The mask of patriotism
      is allowed to cover the most glaring inconsistencies; and the
      enemies, perhaps the assassins, of Othman now demanded vengeance
      for his blood. They were accompanied in their flight by Ayesha,
      the widow of the prophet, who cherished, to the last hour of her
      life, an implacable hatred against the husband and the posterity
      of Fatima. The most reasonable Moslems were scandalized, that the
      mother of the faithful should expose in a camp her person and
      character; 1733 but the superstitious crowd was confident that
      her presence would sanctify the justice, and assure the success,
      of their cause. At the head of twenty thousand of his loyal
      Arabs, and nine thousand valiant auxiliaries of Cufa, the caliph
      encountered and defeated the superior numbers of the rebels under
      the walls of Bassora. 1734 Their leaders, Telha and Zobeir, 1735
      were slain in the first battle that stained with civil blood the
      arms of the Moslems. 1736 After passing through the ranks to
      animate the troops, Ayesha had chosen her post amidst the dangers
      of the field. In the heat of the action, seventy men, who held
      the bridle of her camel, were successively killed or wounded; and
      the cage or litter, in which she sat, was stuck with javelins and
      darts like the quills of a porcupine. The venerable captive
      sustained with firmness the reproaches of the conqueror, and was
      speedily dismissed to her proper station at the tomb of Mahomet,
      with the respect and tenderness that was still due to the widow
      of the apostle. 1737 After this victory, which was styled the Day
      of the Camel, Ali marched against a more formidable adversary;
      against Moawiyah, the son of Abu Sophian, who had assumed the
      title of caliph, and whose claim was supported by the forces of
      Syria and the interest of the house of Ommiyah. From the passage
      of Thapsacus, the plain of Siffin 174 extends along the western
      bank of the Euphrates. On this spacious and level theatre, the
      two competitors waged a desultory war of one hundred and ten
      days. In the course of ninety actions or skirmishes, the loss of
      Ali was estimated at twenty-five, that of Moawiyah at forty-five,
      thousand soldiers; and the list of the slain was dignified with
      the names of five-and-twenty veterans who had fought at Beder
      under the standard of Mahomet. In this sanguinary contest the
      lawful caliph displayed a superior character of valor and
      humanity. 1741 His troops were strictly enjoined to await the
      first onset of the enemy, to spare their flying brethren, and to
      respect the bodies of the dead, and the chastity of the female
      captives. He generously proposed to save the blood of the Moslems
      by a single combat; but his trembling rival declined the
      challenge as a sentence of inevitable death. The ranks of the
      Syrians were broken by the charge of a hero who was mounted on a
      piebald horse, and wielded with irresistible force his ponderous
      and two-edged sword. As often as he smote a rebel, he shouted the
      Allah Acbar, “God is victorious!” and in the tumult of a
      nocturnal battle, he was heard to repeat four hundred times that
      tremendous exclamation. The prince of Damascus already meditated
      his flight; but the certain victory was snatched from the grasp
      of Ali by the disobedience and enthusiasm of his troops. Their
      conscience was awed by the solemn appeal to the books of the
      Koran which Moawiyah exposed on the foremost lances; and Ali was
      compelled to yield to a disgraceful truce and an insidious
      compromise. He retreated with sorrow and indignation to Cufa; his
      party was discouraged; the distant provinces of Persia, of Yemen,
      and of Egypt, were subdued or seduced by his crafty rival; and
      the stroke of fanaticism, which was aimed against the three
      chiefs of the nation, was fatal only to the cousin of Mahomet. In
      the temple of Mecca, three Charegites or enthusiasts discoursed
      of the disorders of the church and state: they soon agreed, that
      the deaths of Ali, of Moawiyah, and of his friend Amrou, the
      viceroy of Egypt, would restore the peace and unity of religion.
      Each of the assassins chose his victim, poisoned his dagger,
      devoted his life, and secretly repaired to the scene of action.
      Their resolution was equally desperate: but the first mistook the
      person of Amrou, and stabbed the deputy who occupied his seat;
      the prince of Damascus was dangerously hurt by the second; the
      lawful caliph, in the mosch of Cufa, received a mortal wound from
      the hand of the third. He expired in the sixty-third year of his
      age, and mercifully recommended to his children, that they would
      despatch the murderer by a single stroke. 1742 The sepulchre of
      Ali 175 was concealed from the tyrants of the house of Ommiyah;
      176 but in the fourth age of the Hegira, a tomb, a temple, a
      city, arose near the ruins of Cufa. 177 Many thousands of the
      Shiites repose in holy ground at the feet of the vicar of God;
      and the desert is vivified by the numerous and annual visits of
      the Persians, who esteem their devotion not less meritorious than
      the pilgrimage of Mecca.

      instance of Ali’s magnanimity. The superior generalship of
      Moawiyah had cut off the army of Ali from the Euphrates; his
      soldiers were perishing from want of water. Ali sent a message to
      his rival to request free access to the river, declaring that
      under the same circumstances he would not allow any of the
      faithful, though his adversaries, to perish from thirst. After
      some debate, Moawiyah determined to avail himself of the
      advantage of his situation, and to reject the demand of Ali. The
      soldiers of Ali became desperate; forced their way through that
      part of the hostile army which commanded the river, and in their
      turn entirely cut off the troops of Moawiyah from the water.
      Moawiyah was reduced to make the same supplication to Ali. The
      generous caliph instantly complied; and both armies, with their
      cattle enjoyed free and unmolested access to the river. Price,

      The persecutors of Mahomet usurped the inheritance of his
      children; and the champions of idolatry became the supreme heads
      of his religion and empire. The opposition of Abu Sophian had
      been fierce and obstinate; his conversion was tardy and
      reluctant; his new faith was fortified by necessity and interest;
      he served, he fought, perhaps he believed; and the sins of the
      time of ignorance were expiated by the recent merits of the
      family of Ommiyah. Moawiyah, the son of Abu Sophian, and of the
      cruel Henda, was dignified, in his early youth, with the office
      or title of secretary of the prophet: the judgment of Omar
      intrusted him with the government of Syria; and he administered
      that important province above forty years, either in a
      subordinate or supreme rank. Without renouncing the fame of valor
      and liberality, he affected the reputation of humanity and
      moderation: a grateful people was attached to their benefactor;
      and the victorious Moslems were enriched with the spoils of
      Cyprus and Rhodes. The sacred duty of pursuing the assassins of
      Othman was the engine and pretence of his ambition. The bloody
      shirt of the martyr was exposed in the mosch of Damascus: the
      emir deplored the fate of his injured kinsman; and sixty thousand
      Syrians were engaged in his service by an oath of fidelity and
      revenge. Amrou, the conqueror of Egypt, himself an army, was the
      first who saluted the new monarch, and divulged the dangerous
      secret, that the Arabian caliphs might be created elsewhere than
      in the city of the prophet. 178 The policy of Moawiyah eluded the
      valor of his rival; and, after the death of Ali, he negotiated
      the abdication of his son Hassan, whose mind was either above or
      below the government of the world, and who retired without a sigh
      from the palace of Cufa to an humble cell near the tomb of his
      grandfather. The aspiring wishes of the caliph were finally
      crowned by the important change of an elective to an hereditary
      kingdom. Some murmurs of freedom or fanaticism attested the
      reluctance of the Arabs, and four citizens of Medina refused the
      oath of fidelity; but the designs of Moawiyah were conducted with
      vigor and address; and his son Yezid, a feeble and dissolute
      youth, was proclaimed as the commander of the faithful and the
      successor of the apostle of God.

      178 (return) [ I borrow, on this occasion, the strong sense and
      expression of Tacitus, (Hist. i. 4: ) Evulgato imperii arcano
      posse imperatorem alni quam Romae fieri.]

      A familiar story is related of the benevolence of one of the sons
      of Ali. In serving at table, a slave had inadvertently dropped a
      dish of scalding broth on his master: the heedless wretch fell
      prostrate, to deprecate his punishment, and repeated a verse of
      the Koran: “Paradise is for those who command their anger: “—“I
      am not angry: “—“and for those who pardon offences: “—“I pardon
      your offence: “—“and for those who return good for evil: “—”I
      give you your liberty and four hundred pieces of silver.” With an
      equal measure of piety, Hosein, the younger brother of Hassan,
      inherited a remnant of his father’s spirit, and served with honor
      against the Christians in the siege of Constantinople. The
      primogeniture of the line of Hashem, and the holy character of
      grandson of the apostle, had centred in his person, and he was at
      liberty to prosecute his claim against Yezid, the tyrant of
      Damascus, whose vices he despised, and whose title he had never
      deigned to acknowledge. A list was secretly transmitted from Cufa
      to Medina, of one hundred and forty thousand Moslems, who
      professed their attachment to his cause, and who were eager to
      draw their swords so soon as he should appear on the banks of the
      Euphrates. Against the advice of his wisest friends, he resolved
      to trust his person and family in the hands of a perfidious
      people. He traversed the desert of Arabia with a timorous retinue
      of women and children; but as he approached the confines of Irak
      he was alarmed by the solitary or hostile face of the country,
      and suspected either the defection or ruin of his party. His
      fears were just: Obeidollah, the governor of Cufa, had
      extinguished the first sparks of an insurrection; and Hosein, in
      the plain of Kerbela, was encompassed by a body of five thousand
      horse, who intercepted his communication with the city and the
      river. He might still have escaped to a fortress in the desert,
      that had defied the power of Caesar and Chosroes, and confided in
      the fidelity of the tribe of Tai, which would have armed ten
      thousand warriors in his defence.

      In a conference with the chief of the enemy, he proposed the
      option of three honorable conditions: that he should be allowed
      to return to Medina, or be stationed in a frontier garrison
      against the Turks, or safely conducted to the presence of Yezid.
      But the commands of the caliph, or his lieutenant, were stern and
      absolute; and Hosein was informed that he must either submit as a
      captive and a criminal to the commander of the faithful, or
      expect the consequences of his rebellion. “Do you think,” replied
      he, “to terrify me with death?” And, during the short respite of
      a night, 1781 he prepared with calm and solemn resignation to
      encounter his fate. He checked the lamentations of his sister
      Fatima, who deplored the impending ruin of his house. “Our
      trust,” said Hosein, “is in God alone. All things, both in heaven
      and earth, must perish and return to their Creator. My brother,
      my father, my mother, were better than me, and every Mussulman
      has an example in the prophet.” He pressed his friends to consult
      their safety by a timely flight: they unanimously refused to
      desert or survive their beloved master: and their courage was
      fortified by a fervent prayer and the assurance of paradise. On
      the morning of the fatal day, he mounted on horseback, with his
      sword in one hand and the Koran in the other: his generous band
      of martyrs consisted only of thirty-two horse and forty foot; but
      their flanks and rear were secured by the tent-ropes, and by a
      deep trench which they had filled with lighted fagots, according
      to the practice of the Arabs. The enemy advanced with reluctance,
      and one of their chiefs deserted, with thirty followers, to claim
      the partnership of inevitable death. In every close onset, or
      single combat, the despair of the Fatimites was invincible; but
      the surrounding multitudes galled them from a distance with a
      cloud of arrows, and the horses and men were successively slain;
      a truce was allowed on both sides for the hour of prayer; and the
      battle at length expired by the death of the last companions of
      Hosein. Alone, weary, and wounded, he seated himself at the door
      of his tent. As he tasted a drop of water, he was pierced in the
      mouth with a dart; and his son and nephew, two beautiful youths,
      were killed in his arms. He lifted his hands to heaven; they were
      full of blood; and he uttered a funeral prayer for the living and
      the dead. In a transport of despair his sister issued from the
      tent, and adjured the general of the Cufians, that he would not
      suffer Hosein to be murdered before his eyes: a tear trickled
      down his venerable beard; and the boldest of his soldiers fell
      back on every side as the dying hero threw himself among them.
      The remorseless Shamer, a name detested by the faithful,
      reproached their cowardice; and the grandson of Mahomet was slain
      with three-and-thirty strokes of lances and swords. After they
      had trampled on his body, they carried his head to the castle of
      Cufa, and the inhuman Obeidollah struck him on the mouth with a
      cane: “Alas,” exclaimed an aged Mussulman, “on these lips have I
      seen the lips of the apostle of God!” In a distant age and
      climate, the tragic scene of the death of Hosein will awaken the
      sympathy of the coldest reader. 179 1791 On the annual festival
      of his martyrdom, in the devout pilgrimage to his sepulchre, his
      Persian votaries abandon their souls to the religious frenzy of
      sorrow and indignation. 180

      1791 (return) [ The account of Hosein’s death, in the Persian
      Tarikh Tebry, is much longer; in some circumstances, more
      pathetic, than that of Ockley, followed by Gibbon. His family,
      after his defenders were all slain, perished in succession before
      his eyes. They had been cut off from the water, and suffered all
      the agonies of thirst. His eldest son, Ally Akbar, after ten
      different assaults on the enemy, in each of which he slew two or
      three, complained bitterly of his sufferings from heat and
      thirst. “His father arose, and introducing his own tongue within
      the parched lips of his favorite child, thus endeavored to
      alleviate his sufferings by the only means of which his enemies
      had not yet been able to deprive him.” Ally was slain and cut to
      pieces in his sight: this wrung from him his first and only cry;
      then it was that his sister Zeyneb rushed from the tent. The
      rest, including his nephew, fell in succession. Hosein’s horse
      was wounded—he fell to the ground. The hour of prayer, between
      noon and sunset, had arrived; the Imaun began the religious
      duties:—as Hosein prayed, he heard the cries of his infant child
      Abdallah, only twelve months old. The child was, at his desire,
      placed on his bosom: as he wept over it, it was transfixed by an
      arrow. Hosein dragged himself to the Euphrates: as he slaked his
      burning thirst, his mouth was pierced by an arrow: he drank his
      own blood. Wounded in four-and-thirty places, he still gallantly
      resisted. A soldier named Zeraiah gave the fatal wound: his head
      was cut off by Ziliousheng. Price, p. 402, 410.—M.]

      180 (return) [ Niebuhr the Dane (Voyages en Arabie, &c., tom. ii.
      p. 208, &c.) is, perhaps, the only European traveller who has
      dared to visit Meshed Ali and Meshed Hosein. The two sepulchres
      are in the hands of the Turks, who tolerate and tax the devotion
      of the Persian heretics. The festival of the death of Hosein is
      amply described by Sir John Chardin, a traveller whom I have
      often praised.]

      When the sisters and children of Ali were brought in chains to
      the throne of Damascus, the caliph was advised to extirpate the
      enmity of a popular and hostile race, whom he had injured beyond
      the hope of reconciliation. But Yezid preferred the councils of
      mercy; and the mourning family was honorably dismissed to mingle
      their tears with their kindred at Medina. The glory of martyrdom
      superseded the right of primogeniture; and the twelve imams, 181
      or pontiffs, of the Persian creed, are Ali, Hassan, Hosein, and
      the lineal descendants of Hosein to the ninth generation. Without
      arms, or treasures, or subjects, they successively enjoyed the
      veneration of the people, and provoked the jealousy of the
      reigning caliphs: their tombs, at Mecca or Medina, on the banks
      of the Euphrates, or in the province of Chorasan, are still
      visited by the devotion of their sect. Their names were often the
      pretence of sedition and civil war; but these royal saints
      despised the pomp of the world: submitted to the will of God and
      the injustice of man; and devoted their innocent lives to the
      study and practice of religion. The twelfth and last of the
      Imams, conspicuous by the title of Mahadi, or the Guide,
      surpassed the solitude and sanctity of his predecessors. He
      concealed himself in a cavern near Bagdad: the time and place of
      his death are unknown; and his votaries pretend that he still
      lives, and will appear before the day of judgment to overthrow
      the tyranny of Dejal, or the Antichrist. 182 In the lapse of two
      or three centuries, the posterity of Abbas, the uncle of Mahomet,
      had multiplied to the number of thirty-three thousand: 183 the
      race of Ali might be equally prolific: the meanest individual was
      above the first and greatest of princes; and the most eminent
      were supposed to excel the perfection of angels. But their
      adverse fortune, and the wide extent of the Mussulman empire,
      allowed an ample scope for every bold and artful imposture, who
      claimed affinity with the holy seed: the sceptre of the
      Almohades, in Spain and Africa; of the Fatimites, in Egypt and
      Syria; 184 of the Sultans of Yemen; and of the Sophis of Persia;
      185 has been consecrated by this vague and ambiguous title. Under
      their reigns it might be dangerous to dispute the legitimacy of
      their birth; and one of the Fatimite caliphs silenced an
      indiscreet question by drawing his cimeter: “This,” said Moez,
      “is my pedigree; and these,” casting a handful of gold to his
      soldiers,—“and these are my kindred and my children.” In the
      various conditions of princes, or doctors, or nobles, or
      merchants, or beggars, a swarm of the genuine or fictitious
      descendants of Mahomet and Ali is honored with the appellation of
      sheiks, or sherifs, or emirs. In the Ottoman empire they are
      distinguished by a green turban; receive a stipend from the
      treasury; are judged only by their chief; and, however debased by
      fortune or character, still assert the proud preeminence of their
      birth. A family of three hundred persons, the pure and orthodox
      branch of the caliph Hassan, is preserved without taint or
      suspicion in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and still
      retains, after the revolutions of twelve centuries, the custody
      of the temple, and the sovereignty of their native land. The fame
      and merit of Mahomet would ennoble a plebeian race, and the
      ancient blood of the Koreish transcends the recent majesty of the
      kings of the earth. 186

      many, qui absque controversia genuini sunt Alidarum, homines
      propaginum suae gentis exacte callentes. He quotes some lines

      trace the intermediate degrees in any genuine or fabulous
      pedigree. If they were truly Fatimites, they might draw their
      origin from the princes of Mazanderan, who reigned in the ixth
      century, (D’Herbelot, p. 96.)]

      9-16, 317 &c.) It is much to be lamented, that the Danish
      traveller was unable to purchase the chronicles of Arabia.]

      The talents of Mahomet are entitled to our applause; but his
      success has, perhaps, too strongly attracted our admiration. Are
      we surprised that a multitude of proselytes should embrace the
      doctrine and the passions of an eloquent fanatic? In the heresies
      of the church, the same seduction has been tried and repeated
      from the time of the apostles to that of the reformers. Does it
      seem incredible that a private citizen should grasp the sword and
      the sceptre, subdue his native country, and erect a monarchy by
      his victorious arms? In the moving picture of the dynasties of
      the East, a hundred fortunate usurpers have arisen from a baser
      origin, surmounted more formidable obstacles, and filled a larger
      scope of empire and conquest. Mahomet was alike instructed to
      preach and to fight; and the union of these opposite qualities,
      while it enhanced his merit, contributed to his success: the
      operation of force and persuasion, of enthusiasm and fear,
      continually acted on each other, till every barrier yielded to
      their irresistible power. His voice invited the Arabs to freedom
      and victory, to arms and rapine, to the indulgence of their
      darling passions in this world and the other: the restraints
      which he imposed were requisite to establish the credit of the
      prophet, and to exercise the obedience of the people; and the
      only objection to his success was his rational creed of the unity
      and perfections of God. It is not the propagation, but the
      permanency, of his religion, that deserves our wonder: the same
      pure and perfect impression which he engraved at Mecca and
      Medina, is preserved, after the revolutions of twelve centuries,
      by the Indian, the African, and the Turkish proselytes of the
      Koran. If the Christian apostles, St. Peter or St. Paul, could
      return to the Vatican, they might possibly inquire the name of
      the Deity who is worshipped with such mysterious rites in that
      magnificent temple: at Oxford or Geneva, they would experience
      less surprise; but it might still be incumbent on them to peruse
      the catechism of the church, and to study the orthodox
      commentators on their own writings and the words of their Master.
      But the Turkish dome of St. Sophia, with an increase of splendor
      and size, represents the humble tabernacle erected at Medina by
      the hands of Mahomet. The Mahometans have uniformly withstood the
      temptation of reducing the object of their faith and devotion to
      a level with the senses and imagination of man. “I believe in one
      God, and Mahomet the apostle of God,” is the simple and
      invariable profession of Islam. The intellectual image of the
      Deity has never been degraded by any visible idol; the honors of
      the prophet have never transgressed the measure of human virtue;
      and his living precepts have restrained the gratitude of his
      disciples within the bounds of reason and religion. The votaries
      of Ali have, indeed, consecrated the memory of their hero, his
      wife, and his children; and some of the Persian doctors pretend
      that the divine essence was incarnate in the person of the Imams;
      but their superstition is universally condemned by the Sonnites;
      and their impiety has afforded a seasonable warning against the
      worship of saints and martyrs. The metaphysical questions on the
      attributes of God, and the liberty of man, have been agitated in
      the schools of the Mahometans, as well as in those of the
      Christians; but among the former they have never engaged the
      passions of the people, or disturbed the tranquillity of the
      state. The cause of this important difference may be found in the
      separation or union of the regal and sacerdotal characters. It
      was the interest of the caliphs, the successors of the prophet
      and commanders of the faithful, to repress and discourage all
      religious innovations: the order, the discipline, the temporal
      and spiritual ambition of the clergy, are unknown to the Moslems;
      and the sages of the law are the guides of their conscience and
      the oracles of their faith. From the Atlantic to the Ganges, the
      Koran is acknowledged as the fundamental code, not only of
      theology, but of civil and criminal jurisprudence; and the laws
      which regulate the actions and the property of mankind are
      guarded by the infallible and immutable sanction of the will of
      God. This religious servitude is attended with some practical
      disadvantage; the illiterate legislator had been often misled by
      his own prejudices and those of his country; and the institutions
      of the Arabian desert may be ill adapted to the wealth and
      numbers of Ispahan and Constantinople. On these occasions, the
      Cadhi respectfully places on his head the holy volume, and
      substitutes a dexterous interpretation more apposite to the
      principles of equity, and the manners and policy of the times.

      His beneficial or pernicious influence on the public happiness is
      the last consideration in the character of Mahomet. The most
      bitter or most bigoted of his Christian or Jewish foes will
      surely allow that he assumed a false commission to inculcate a
      salutary doctrine, less perfect only than their own. He piously
      supposed, as the basis of his religion, the truth and sanctity of
      their prior revolutions, the virtues and miracles of their
      founders. The idols of Arabia were broken before the throne of
      God; the blood of human victims was expiated by prayer, and
      fasting, and alms, the laudable or innocent arts of devotion; and
      his rewards and punishments of a future life were painted by the
      images most congenial to an ignorant and carnal generation.
      Mahomet was, perhaps, incapable of dictating a moral and
      political system for the use of his countrymen: but he breathed
      among the faithful a spirit of charity and friendship;
      recommended the practice of the social virtues; and checked, by
      his laws and precepts, the thirst of revenge, and the oppression
      of widows and orphans. The hostile tribes were united in faith
      and obedience, and the valor which had been idly spent in
      domestic quarrels was vigorously directed against a foreign
      enemy. Had the impulse been less powerful, Arabia, free at home
      and formidable abroad, might have flourished under a succession
      of her native monarchs. Her sovereignty was lost by the extent
      and rapidity of conquest. The colonies of the nation were
      scattered over the East and West, and their blood was mingled
      with the blood of their converts and captives. After the reign of
      three caliphs, the throne was transported from Medina to the
      valley of Damascus and the banks of the Tigris; the holy cities
      were violated by impious war; Arabia was ruled by the rod of a
      subject, perhaps of a stranger; and the Bedoweens of the desert,
      awakening from their dream of dominion, resumed their old and
      solitary independence. 187

      187 (return) [ The writers of the Modern Universal History (vols.
      i. and ii.) have compiled, in 850 folio pages, the life of
      Mahomet and the annals of the caliphs. They enjoyed the advantage
      of reading, and sometimes correcting, the Arabic text; yet,
      notwithstanding their high-sounding boasts, I cannot find, after
      the conclusion of my work, that they have afforded me much (if
      any) additional information. The dull mass is not quickened by a
      spark of philosophy or taste; and the compilers indulge the
      criticism of acrimonious bigotry against Boulainvilliers, Sale,
      Gagnier, and all who have treated Mahomet with favor, or even
      justice.]
