Chapter XLVII: Ecclesiastical Discord.—Part I.

     Theological History Of The Doctrine Of The Incarnation.—The Human
     And Divine Nature Of Christ.—Enmity Of The Patriarchs Of
     Alexandria And Constantinople.—St. Cyril And Nestorius. —Third
     General Council Of Ephesus.—Heresy Of Eutyches.— Fourth General
     Council Of Chalcedon.—Civil And Ecclesiastical
     Discord.—Intolerance Of Justinian.—The Three Chapters.—The
     Monothelite Controversy.—State Of The Oriental Sects:—I.  The
     Nestorians.—II.  The Jacobites.— III.  The Maronites.—IV. The
     Armenians.—V.  The Copts And Abyssinians.

      After the extinction of paganism, the Christians in peace and
      piety might have enjoyed their solitary triumph. But the
      principle of discord was alive in their bosom, and they were more
      solicitous to explore the nature, than to practice the laws, of
      their founder. I have already observed, that the disputes of the
      Trinity were succeeded by those of the Incarnation; alike
      scandalous to the church, alike pernicious to the state, still
      more minute in their origin, still more durable in their effects.

      It is my design to comprise in the present chapter a religious
      war of two hundred and fifty years, to represent the
      ecclesiastical and political schism of the Oriental sects, and to
      introduce their clamorous or sanguinary contests, by a modest
      inquiry into the doctrines of the primitive church. 1

      1 (return) [ By what means shall I authenticate this previous
      inquiry, which I have studied to circumscribe and compress?—If I
      persist in supporting each fact or reflection by its proper and
      special evidence, every line would demand a string of
      testimonies, and every note would swell to a critical
      dissertation. But the numberless passages of antiquity which I
      have seen with my own eyes, are compiled, digested and
      illustrated by Petavius and Le Clerc, by Beausobre and Mosheim. I
      shall be content to fortify my narrative by the names and
      characters of these respectable guides; and in the contemplation
      of a minute or remote object, I am not ashamed to borrow the aid
      of the strongest glasses: 1. The Dogmata Theologica of Petavius
      are a work of incredible labor and compass; the volumes which
      relate solely to the Incarnation (two folios, vth and vith, of
      837 pages) are divided into xvi. books—the first of history, the
      remainder of controversy and doctrine. The Jesuit’s learning is
      copious and correct; his Latinity is pure, his method clear, his
      argument profound and well connected; but he is the slave of the
      fathers, the scourge of heretics, and the enemy of truth and
      candor, as often as they are inimical to the Catholic cause. 2.
      The Arminian Le Clerc, who has composed in a quarto volume
      (Amsterdam, 1716) the ecclesiastical history of the two first
      centuries, was free both in his temper and situation; his sense
      is clear, but his thoughts are narrow; he reduces the reason or
      folly of ages to the standard of his private judgment, and his
      impartiality is sometimes quickened, and sometimes tainted by his
      opposition to the fathers. See the heretics (Cerinthians, lxxx.
      Ebionites, ciii. Carpocratians, cxx. Valentiniins, cxxi.
      Basilidians, cxxiii. Marcionites, cxli., &c.) under their proper
      dates. 3. The Histoire Critique du Manicheisme (Amsterdam, 1734,
      1739, in two vols. in 4to., with a posthumous dissertation sur
      les Nazarenes, Lausanne, 1745) of M. de Beausobre is a treasure
      of ancient philosophy and theology. The learned historian spins
      with incomparable art the systematic thread of opinion, and
      transforms himself by turns into the person of a saint, a sage,
      or a heretic. Yet his refinement is sometimes excessive; he
      betrays an amiable partiality in favor of the weaker side, and,
      while he guards against calumny, he does not allow sufficient
      scope for superstition and fanaticism. A copious table of
      contents will direct the reader to any point that he wishes to
      examine. 4. Less profound than Petavius, less independent than Le
      Clerc, less ingenious than Beausobre, the historian Mosheim is
      full, rational, correct, and moderate. In his learned work, De
      Rebus Christianis ante Constantinum (Helmstadt 1753, in 4to.,)
      see the Nazarenes and Ebionites, p. 172—179, 328—332. The
      Gnostics in general, p. 179, &c. Cerinthus, p. 196—202.
      Basilides, p. 352—361. Carpocrates, p. 363—367. Valentinus, p.
      371—389 Marcion, p. 404—410. The Manichaeans, p. 829-837, &c.]

      I. A laudable regard for the honor of the first proselyte has
      countenanced the belief, the hope, the wish, that the Ebionites,
      or at least the Nazarenes, were distinguished only by their
      obstinate perseverance in the practice of the Mosaic rites.

      Their churches have disappeared, their books are obliterated:
      their obscure freedom might allow a latitude of faith, and the
      softness of their infant creed would be variously moulded by the
      zeal or prudence of three hundred years. Yet the most charitable
      criticism must refuse these sectaries any knowledge of the pure
      and proper divinity of Christ. Educated in the school of Jewish
      prophecy and prejudice, they had never been taught to elevate
      their hopes above a human and temporal Messiah. 2 If they had
      courage to hail their king when he appeared in a plebeian garb,
      their grosser apprehensions were incapable of discerning their
      God, who had studiously disguised his celestial character under
      the name and person of a mortal. 3 The familiar companions of
      Jesus of Nazareth conversed with their friend and countryman,
      who, in all the actions of rational and animal life, appeared of
      the same species with themselves. His progress from infancy to
      youth and manhood was marked by a regular increase in stature and
      wisdom; and after a painful agony of mind and body, he expired on
      the cross. He lived and died for the service of mankind: but the
      life and death of Socrates had likewise been devoted to the cause
      of religion and justice; and although the stoic or the hero may
      disdain the humble virtues of Jesus, the tears which he shed over
      his friend and country may be esteemed the purest evidence of his
      humanity. The miracles of the gospel could not astonish a people
      who held with intrepid faith the more splendid prodigies of the
      Mosaic law. The prophets of ancient days had cured diseases,
      raised the dead, divided the sea, stopped the sun, and ascended
      to heaven in a fiery chariot. And the metaphorical style of the
      Hebrews might ascribe to a saint and martyr the adoptive title of
      Son of God.

      2 (return) [ Jew Tryphon, (Justin. Dialog. p. 207) in the name of
      his countrymen, and the modern Jews, the few who divert their
      thoughts from money to religion, still hold the same language,
      and allege the literal sense of the prophets. * Note: See on this
      passage Bp. Kaye, Justin Martyr, p. 25.—M. Note: Most of the
      modern writers, who have closely examined this subject, and who
      will not be suspected of any theological bias, Rosenmuller on
      Isaiah ix. 5, and on Psalm xlv. 7, and Bertholdt, Christologia
      Judaeorum, c. xx., rightly ascribe much higher notions of the
      Messiah to the Jews. In fact, the dispute seems to rest on the
      notion that there was a definite and authorized notion of the
      Messiah, among the Jews, whereas it was probably so vague, as to
      admit every shade of difference, from the vulgar expectation of a
      mere temporal king, to the philosophic notion of an emanation
      from the Deity.—M.]

      3 (return) [ Chrysostom (Basnage, Hist. des Juifs, tom. v. c. 9,
      p. 183) and Athanasius (Petav. Dogmat. Theolog. tom. v. l. i. c.
      2, p. 3) are obliged to confess that the Divinity of Christ is
      rarely mentioned by himself or his apostles.]

      Yet in the insufficient creed of the Nazarenes and the Ebionites,
      a distinction is faintly noticed between the heretics, who
      confounded the generation of Christ in the common order of
      nature, and the less guilty schismatics, who revered the
      virginity of his mother, and excluded the aid of an earthly
      father. The incredulity of the former was countenanced by the
      visible circumstances of his birth, the legal marriage of the
      reputed parents, Joseph and Mary, and his lineal claim to the
      kingdom of David and the inheritance of Judah. But the secret and
      authentic history has been recorded in several copies of the
      Gospel according to St. Matthew, 4 which these sectaries long
      preserved in the original Hebrew, 5 as the sole evidence of their
      faith. The natural suspicions of the husband, conscious of his
      own chastity, were dispelled by the assurance (in a dream) that
      his wife was pregnant of the Holy Ghost: and as this distant and
      domestic prodigy could not fall under the personal observation of
      the historian, he must have listened to the same voice which
      dictated to Isaiah the future conception of a virgin. The son of
      a virgin, generated by the ineffable operation of the Holy
      Spirit, was a creature without example or resemblance, superior
      in every attribute of mind and body to the children of Adam.
      Since the introduction of the Greek or Chaldean philosophy, 6 the
      Jews 7 were persuaded of the preexistence, transmigration, and
      immortality of souls; and providence was justified by a
      supposition, that they were confined in their earthly prisons to
      expiate the stains which they had contracted in a former state. 8
      But the degrees of purity and corruption are almost immeasurable.
      It might be fairly presumed, that the most sublime and virtuous
      of human spirits was infused into the offspring of Mary and the
      Holy Ghost; 9 that his abasement was the result of his voluntary
      choice; and that the object of his mission was, to purify, not
      his own, but the sins of the world. On his return to his native
      skies, he received the immense reward of his obedience; the
      everlasting kingdom of the Messiah, which had been darkly
      foretold by the prophets, under the carnal images of peace, of
      conquest, and of dominion. Omnipotence could enlarge the human
      faculties of Christ to the extend of is celestial office. In the
      language of antiquity, the title of God has not been severely
      confined to the first parent, and his incomparable minister, his
      only-begotten son, might claim, without presumption, the
      religious, though secondary, worship of a subject of a subject
      world.

      4 (return) [ The two first chapters of St. Matthew did not exist
      in the Ebionite copies, (Epiphan. Haeres. xxx. 13;) and the
      miraculous conception is one of the last articles which Dr.
      Priestley has curtailed from his scanty creed. * Note: The
      distinct allusion to the facts related in the two first chapters
      of the Gospel, in a work evidently written about the end of the
      reign of Nero, the Ascensio Isaiae, edited by Archbishop
      Lawrence, seems convincing evidence that they are integral parts
      of the authentic Christian history.—M.]

      5 (return) [ It is probable enough that the first of the Gospels
      for the use of the Jewish converts was composed in the Hebrew or
      Syriac idiom: the fact is attested by a chain of fathers—Papias,
      Irenaeus, Origen, Jerom, &c. It is devoutly believed by the
      Catholics, and admitted by Casaubon, Grotius, and Isaac Vossius,
      among the Protestant critics. But this Hebrew Gospel of St.
      Matthew is most unaccountably lost; and we may accuse the
      diligence or fidelity of the primitive churches, who have
      preferred the unauthorized version of some nameless Greek.
      Erasmus and his followers, who respect our Greek text as the
      original Gospel, deprive themselves of the evidence which
      declares it to be the work of an apostle. See Simon, Hist.
      Critique, &c., tom. iii. c. 5—9, p. 47—101, and the Prolegomena
      of Mill and Wetstein to the New Testament. * Note: Surely the
      extinction of the Judaeo-Christian community related from Mosheim
      by Gibbon himself (c. xv.) accounts both simply and naturally for
      the loss of a composition, which had become of no use—nor does it
      follow that the Greek Gospel of St. Matthew is unauthorized.—M.]

      6 (return) [ The metaphysics of the soul are disengaged by Cicero
      (Tusculan. l. i.) and Maximus of Tyre (Dissertat. xvi.) from the
      intricacies of dialogue, which sometimes amuse, and often
      perplex, the readers of the Phoedrus, the Phoedon, and the Laws
      of Plato.]

      7 (return) [ The disciples of Jesus were persuaded that a man
      might have sinned before he was born, (John, ix. 2,) and the
      Pharisees held the transmigration of virtuous souls, (Joseph. de
      Bell. Judaico, l. ii. c. 7;) and a modern Rabbi is modestly
      assured, that Hermes, Pythagoras, Plato, &c., derived their
      metaphysics from his illustrious countrymen.]

      8 (return) [ Four different opinions have been entertained
      concerning the origin of human souls: 1. That they are eternal
      and divine. 2. That they were created in a separate state of
      existence, before their union with the body. 3. That they have
      been propagated from the original stock of Adam, who contained in
      himself the mental as well as the corporeal seed of his
      posterity. 4. That each soul is occasionally created and embodied
      in the moment of conception.—The last of these sentiments appears
      to have prevailed among the moderns; and our spiritual history is
      grown less sublime, without becoming more intelligible.]

      9 (return) [ It was one of the fifteen heresies imputed to
      Origen, and denied by his apologist, (Photius, Bibliothec. cod.
      cxvii. p. 296.) Some of the Rabbis attribute one and the same
      soul to the persons of Adam, David, and the Messiah.]

      II. The seeds of the faith, which had slowly arisen in the rocky
      and ungrateful soil of Judea, were transplanted, in full
      maturity, to the happier climes of the Gentiles; and the
      strangers of Rome or Asia, who never beheld the manhood, were the
      more readily disposed to embrace the divinity, of Christ. The
      polytheist and the philosopher, the Greek and the Barbarian, were
      alike accustomed to conceive a long succession, an infinite chain
      of angels or daemons, or deities, or aeons, or emanations,
      issuing from the throne of light. Nor could it seem strange or
      incredible, that the first of these aeons, the Logos, or Word of
      God, of the same substance with the Father, should descend upon
      earth, to deliver the human race from vice and error, and to
      conduct them in the paths of life and immortality. But the
      prevailing doctrine of the eternity and inherent pravity of
      matter infected the primitive churches of the East. Many among
      the Gentile proselytes refused to believe that a celestial
      spirit, an undivided portion of the first essence, had been
      personally united with a mass of impure and contaminated flesh;
      and, in their zeal for the divinity, they piously abjured the
      humanity, of Christ. While his blood was still recent on Mount
      Calvary, 10 the Docetes, a numerous and learned sect of Asiatics,
      invented the phantastic system, which was afterwards propagated
      by the Marcionites, the Manichaeans, and the various names of the
      Gnostic heresy. 11 They denied the truth and authenticity of the
      Gospels, as far as they relate the conception of Mary, the birth
      of Christ, and the thirty years that preceded the exercise of his
      ministry. He first appeared on the banks of the Jordan in the
      form of perfect manhood; but it was a form only, and not a
      substance; a human figure created by the hand of Omnipotence to
      imitate the faculties and actions of a man, and to impose a
      perpetual illusion on the senses of his friends and enemies.
      Articulate sounds vibrated on the ears of the disciples; but the
      image which was impressed on their optic nerve eluded the more
      stubborn evidence of the touch; and they enjoyed the spiritual,
      not the corporeal, presence of the Son of God. The rage of the
      Jews was idly wasted against an impassive phantom; and the mystic
      scenes of the passion and death, the resurrection and ascension,
      of Christ were represented on the theatre of Jerusalem for the
      benefit of mankind. If it were urged, that such ideal mimicry,
      such incessant deception, was unworthy of the God of truth, the
      Docetes agreed with too many of their orthodox brethren in the
      justification of pious falsehood. In the system of the Gnostics,
      the Jehovah of Israel, the Creator of this lower world, was a
      rebellious, or at least an ignorant, spirit. The Son of God
      descended upon earth to abolish his temple and his law; and, for
      the accomplishment of this salutary end, he dexterously
      transferred to his own person the hope and prediction of a
      temporal Messiah.

      10 (return) [ Apostolis adhuc in seculo superstitibus, apud
      Judaeam Christi sanguine recente, Phantasma domini corpus
      asserebatur. Hieronym, advers. Lucifer. c. 8. The epistle of
      Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans, and even the Gospel according to St.
      John, are levelled against the growing error of the Docetes, who
      had obtained too much credit in the world, (1 John, iv. 1—5.)]

      11 (return) [ About the year 200 of the Christian aera, Irenaeus
      and Hippolytus efuted the thirty-two sects, which had multiplied
      to fourscore in the time of Epiphanius, (Phot. Biblioth. cod.
      cxx. cxxi. cxxii.) The five books of Irenaeus exist only in
      barbarous Latin; but the original might perhaps be found in some
      monastery of Greece.]

      One of the most subtile disputants of the Manichaean school has
      pressed the danger and indecency of supposing, that the God of
      the Christians, in the state of a human foetus, emerged at the
      end of nine months from a female womb. The pious horror of his
      antagonists provoked them to disclaim all sensual circumstances
      of conception and delivery; to maintain that the divinity passed
      through Mary like a sunbeam through a plate of glass; and to
      assert, that the seal of her virginity remained unbroken even at
      the moment when she became the mother of Christ. But the rashness
      of these concessions has encouraged a milder sentiment of those
      of the Docetes, who taught, not that Christ was a phantom, but
      that he was clothed with an impassible and incorruptible body.
      Such, indeed, in the more orthodox system, he has acquired since
      his resurrection, and such he must have always possessed, if it
      were capable of pervading, without resistance or injury, the
      density of intermediate matter. Devoid of its most essential
      properties, it might be exempt from the attributes and
      infirmities of the flesh. A foetus that could increase from an
      invisible point to its full maturity; a child that could attain
      the stature of perfect manhood without deriving any nourishment
      from the ordinary sources, might continue to exist without
      repairing a daily waste by a daily supply of external matter.
      Jesus might share the repasts of his disciples without being
      subject to the calls of thirst or hunger; and his virgin purity
      was never sullied by the involuntary stains of sensual
      concupiscence. Of a body thus singularly constituted, a question
      would arise, by what means, and of what materials, it was
      originally framed; and our sounder theology is startled by an
      answer which was not peculiar to the Gnostics, that both the form
      and the substance proceeded from the divine essence. The idea of
      pure and absolute spirit is a refinement of modern philosophy:
      the incorporeal essence, ascribed by the ancients to human souls,
      celestial beings, and even the Deity himself, does not exclude
      the notion of extended space; and their imagination was satisfied
      with a subtile nature of air, or fire, or aether, incomparably
      more perfect than the grossness of the material world. If we
      define the place, we must describe the figure, of the Deity. Our
      experience, perhaps our vanity, represents the powers of reason
      and virtue under a human form. The Anthropomorphites, who swarmed
      among the monks of Egypt and the Catholics of Africa, could
      produce the express declaration of Scripture, that man was made
      after the image of his Creator. 12 The venerable Serapion, one of
      the saints of the Nitrian deserts, relinquished, with many a
      tear, his darling prejudice; and bewailed, like an infant, his
      unlucky conversion, which had stolen away his God, and left his
      mind without any visible object of faith or devotion. 13

      12 (return) [ The pilgrim Cassian, who visited Egypt in the
      beginning of the vth century, observes and laments the reign of
      anthropomorphism among the monks, who were not conscious that
      they embraced the system of Epicurus, (Cicero, de Nat. Deorum, i.
      18, 34.) Ab universo propemodum genere monachorum, qui per totam
      provinciam Egyptum morabantur, pro simplicitatis errore susceptum
      est, ut e contraric memoratum pontificem (Theophilus) velut
      haeresi gravissima depravatum, pars maxima seniorum ab universo
      fraternitatis corpore decerneret detestandum, (Cassian,
      Collation. x. 2.) As long as St. Augustin remained a Manichaean,
      he was scandalized by the anthropomorphism of the vulgar
      Catholics.]

      13 (return) [ Ita est in oratione senex mente confusus, eo quod
      illam imaginem Deitatis, quam proponere sibi in oratione
      consueverat, aboleri de suo corde sentiret, ut in amarissimos
      fletus, crebrosque singultus repente prorumpens, in terram
      prostratus, cum ejulatu validissimo proclamaret; “Heu me miserum!
      tulerunt a me Deum meum, et quem nunc teneam non habeo, vel quem
      adorem, aut interpallam am nescio.” Cassian, Collat. x. 2.]

      III. Such were the fleeting shadows of the Docetes. A more
      substantial, though less simple, hypothesis, was contrived by
      Cerinthus of Asia, 14 who dared to oppose the last of the
      apostles. Placed on the confines of the Jewish and Gentile world,
      he labored to reconcile the Gnostic with the Ebionite, by
      confessing in the same Messiah the supernatural union of a man
      and a God; and this mystic doctrine was adopted with many
      fanciful improvements by Carpocrates, Basilides, and Valentine,
      15 the heretics of the Egyptian school. In their eyes, Jesus of
      Nazareth was a mere mortal, the legitimate son of Joseph and
      Mary: but he was the best and wisest of the human race, selected
      as the worthy instrument to restore upon earth the worship of the
      true and supreme Deity. When he was baptized in the Jordan, the
      Christ, the first of the aeons, the Son of God himself, descended
      on Jesus in the form of a dove, to inhabit his mind, and direct
      his actions during the allotted period of his ministry. When the
      Messiah was delivered into the hands of the Jews, the Christ, an
      immortal and impassible being, forsook his earthly tabernacle,
      flew back to the pleroma or world of spirits, and left the
      solitary Jesus to suffer, to complain, and to expire. But the
      justice and generosity of such a desertion are strongly
      questionable; and the fate of an innocent martyr, at first
      impelled, and at length abandoned, by his divine companion, might
      provoke the pity and indignation of the profane. Their murmurs
      were variously silenced by the sectaries who espoused and
      modified the double system of Cerinthus. It was alleged, that
      when Jesus was nailed to the cross, he was endowed with a
      miraculous apathy of mind and body, which rendered him insensible
      of his apparent sufferings. It was affirmed, that these
      momentary, though real, pangs would be abundantly repaid by the
      temporal reign of a thousand years reserved for the Messiah in
      his kingdom of the new Jerusalem. It was insinuated, that if he
      suffered, he deserved to suffer; that human nature is never
      absolutely perfect; and that the cross and passion might serve to
      expiate the venial transgressions of the son of Joseph, before
      his mysterious union with the Son of God. 16

      14 (return) [ St. John and Cerinthus (A.D. 80. Cleric. Hist.
      Eccles. p. 493) accidentally met in the public bath of Ephesus;
      but the apostle fled from the heretic, lest the building should
      tumble on their heads. This foolish story, reprobated by Dr.
      Middleton, (Miscellaneous Works, vol. ii.,) is related, however,
      by Irenaeus, (iii. 3,) on the evidence of Polycarp, and was
      probably suited to the time and residence of Cerinthus. The
      obsolete, yet probably the true, reading of 1 John, iv. 3 alludes
      to the double nature of that primitive heretic. * Note: Griesbach
      asserts that all the Greek Mss., all the translators, and all the
      Greek fathers, support the common reading.—Nov. Test. in loc.—M]

      15 (return) [ The Valentinians embraced a complex, and almost
      incoherent, system. 1. Both Christ and Jesus were aeons, though
      of different degrees; the one acting as the rational soul, the
      other as the divine spirit of the Savior. 2. At the time of the
      passion, they both retired, and left only a sensitive soul and a
      human body. 3. Even that body was aethereal, and perhaps
      apparent.—Such are the laborious conclusions of Mosheim. But I
      much doubt whether the Latin translator understood Irenaeus, and
      whether Irenaeus and the Valetinians understood themselves.]

      16 (return) [ The heretics abused the passionate exclamation of
      “My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?” Rousseau, who has
      drawn an eloquent, but indecent, parallel between Christ and
      Socrates, forgets that not a word of impatience or despair
      escaped from the mouth of the dying philosopher. In the Messiah,
      such sentiments could be only apparent; and such ill-sounding
      words were properly explained as the application of a psalm and
      prophecy.]

      IV. All those who believe the immateriality of the soul, a
      specious and noble tenet, must confess, from their present
      experience, the incomprehensible union of mind and matter. A
      similar union is not inconsistent with a much higher, or even
      with the highest, degree of mental faculties; and the incarnation
      of an aeon or archangel, the most perfect of created spirits,
      does not involve any positive contradiction or absurdity. In the
      age of religious freedom, which was determined by the council of
      Nice, the dignity of Christ was measured by private judgment
      according to the indefinite rule of Scripture, or reason, or
      tradition. But when his pure and proper divinity had been
      established on the ruins of Arianism, the faith of the Catholics
      trembled on the edge of a precipice where it was impossible to
      recede, dangerous to stand, dreadful to fall and the manifold
      inconveniences of their creed were aggravated by the sublime
      character of their theology. They hesitated to pronounce; that
      God himself, the second person of an equal and consubstantial
      trinity, was manifested in the flesh; 17 that a being who
      pervades the universe, had been confined in the womb of Mary;
      that his eternal duration had been marked by the days, and
      months, and years of human existence; that the Almighty had been
      scourged and crucified; that his impassible essence had felt pain
      and anguish; that his omniscience was not exempt from ignorance;
      and that the source of life and immortality expired on Mount
      Calvary. These alarming consequences were affirmed with
      unblushing simplicity by Apollinaris, 18 bishop of Laodicea, and
      one of the luminaries of the church. The son of a learned
      grammarian, he was skilled in all the sciences of Greece;
      eloquence, erudition, and philosophy, conspicuous in the volumes
      of Apollinaris, were humbly devoted to the service of religion.
      The worthy friend of Athanasius, the worthy antagonist of Julian,
      he bravely wrestled with the Arians and Polytheists, and though
      he affected the rigor of geometrical demonstration, his
      commentaries revealed the literal and allegorical sense of the
      Scriptures. A mystery, which had long floated in the looseness of
      popular belief, was defined by his perverse diligence in a
      technical form; and he first proclaimed the memorable words, “One
      incarnate nature of Christ,” which are still reechoed with
      hostile clamors in the churches of Asia, Egypt, and Aethiopia. He
      taught that the Godhead was united or mingled with the body of a
      man; and that the Logos, the eternal wisdom, supplied in the
      flesh the place and office of a human soul. Yet as the profound
      doctor had been terrified at his own rashness, Apollinaris was
      heard to mutter some faint accents of excuse and explanation. He
      acquiesced in the old distinction of the Greek philosophers
      between the rational and sensitive soul of man; that he might
      reserve the Logos for intellectual functions, and employ the
      subordinate human principle in the meaner actions of animal life.

      With the moderate Docetes, he revered Mary as the spiritual,
      rather than as the carnal, mother of Christ, whose body either
      came from heaven, impassible and incorruptible, or was absorbed,
      and as it were transformed, into the essence of the Deity. The
      system of Apollinaris was strenuously encountered by the Asiatic
      and Syrian divines whose schools are honored by the names of
      Basil, Gregory and Chrysostom, and tainted by those of Diodorus,
      Theodore, and Nestorius. But the person of the aged bishop of
      Laedicea, his character and dignity, remained inviolate; and his
      rivals, since we may not suspect them of the weakness of
      toleration, were astonished, perhaps, by the novelty of the
      argument, and diffident of the final sentence of the Catholic
      church. Her judgment at length inclined in their favor; the
      heresy of Apollinaris was condemned, and the separate
      congregations of his disciples were proscribed by the Imperial
      laws. But his principles were secretly entertained in the
      monasteries of Egypt, and his enemies felt the hatred of
      Theophilus and Cyril, the successive patriarchs of Alexandria.

      reading, which is visible in the Latin and Syriac versions, still
      exists in the reasoning of the Greek, as well as of the Latin
      fathers; and this fraud, with that of the three witnesses of St.
      John, is admirably detected by Sir Isaac Newton. (See his two
      letters translated by M. de Missy, in the Journal Britannique,

      deeply skilled in critical and theological studies. Note: It
      should be Griesbach in loc. The weight of authority is so much
      against the common reading in both these points, that they are no
      longer urged by prudent controversialists. Would Gibbon’s
      deference for the first of philosophers have extended to all his
      theological conclusions?—M.]

      friend and brother. The style of the more recent historians is
      harsh and hostile: yet Philostorgius compares him (l. viii. c.
      11-15) to Basil and Gregory.]

      V. The grovelling Ebionite, and the fantastic Docetes, were
      rejected and forgotten: the recent zeal against the errors of
      Apollinaris reduced the Catholics to a seeming agreement with the
      double nature of Cerinthus. But instead of a temporary and
      occasional alliance, they established, and we still embrace, the
      substantial, indissoluble, and everlasting union of a perfect God
      with a perfect man, of the second person of the trinity with a
      reasonable soul and human flesh. In the beginning of the fifth
      century, the unity of the two natures was the prevailing doctrine
      of the church. On all sides, it was confessed, that the mode of
      their coexistence could neither be represented by our ideas, nor
      expressed by our language. Yet a secret and incurable discord was
      cherished, between those who were most apprehensive of
      confounding, and those who were most fearful of separating, the
      divinity, and the humanity, of Christ. Impelled by religious
      frenzy, they fled with adverse haste from the error which they
      mutually deemed most destructive of truth and salvation. On
      either hand they were anxious to guard, they were jealous to
      defend, the union and the distinction of the two natures, and to
      invent such forms of speech, such symbols of doctrine, as were
      least susceptible of doubt or ambiguity. The poverty of ideas and
      language tempted them to ransack art and nature for every
      possible comparison, and each comparison misled their fancy in
      the explanation of an incomparable mystery. In the polemic
      microscope, an atom is enlarged to a monster, and each party was
      skilful to exaggerate the absurd or impious conclusions that
      might be extorted from the principles of their adversaries. To
      escape from each other, they wandered through many a dark and
      devious thicket, till they were astonished by the horrid phantoms
      of Cerinthus and Apollinaris, who guarded the opposite issues of
      the theological labyrinth. As soon as they beheld the twilight of
      sense and heresy, they started, measured back their steps, and
      were again involved in the gloom of impenetrable orthodoxy. To
      purge themselves from the guilt or reproach of damnable error,
      they disavowed their consequences, explained their principles,
      excused their indiscretions, and unanimously pronounced the
      sounds of concord and faith. Yet a latent and almost invisible
      spark still lurked among the embers of controversy: by the breath
      of prejudice and passion, it was quickly kindled to a mighty
      flame, and the verbal disputes 19 of the Oriental sects have
      shaken the pillars of the church and state.

      prelates, Gregory Abulpharagius the Jacobite primate of the East,

      that the Melchites, Jacobites, Nestorians, &c., agree in the
      doctrine, and differ only in the expression. Our most learned and
      rational divines—Basnage, Le Clerc, Beausobre, La Croze, Mosheim,
      Jablonski—are inclined to favor this charitable judgment; but the
      zeal of Petavius is loud and angry, and the moderation of Dupin
      is conveyed in a whisper.]

      The name of Cyril of Alexandria is famous in controversial story,
      and the title of saint is a mark that his opinions and his party
      have finally prevailed. In the house of his uncle, the archbishop
      Theophilus, he imbibed the orthodox lessons of zeal and dominion,
      and five years of his youth were profitably spent in the adjacent
      monasteries of Nitria. Under the tuition of the abbot Serapion,
      he applied himself to ecclesiastical studies, with such
      indefatigable ardor, that in the course of one sleepless night,
      he has perused the four Gospels, the Catholic Epistles, and the
      Epistle to the Romans. Origen he detested; but the writings of
      Clemens and Dionysius, of Athanasius and Basil, were continually
      in his hands: by the theory and practice of dispute, his faith
      was confirmed and his wit was sharpened; he extended round his
      cell the cobwebs of scholastic theology, and meditated the works
      of allegory and metaphysics, whose remains, in seven verbose
      folios, now peaceably slumber by the side of their rivals. 20
      Cyril prayed and fasted in the desert, but his thoughts (it is
      the reproach of a friend) 21 were still fixed on the world; and
      the call of Theophilus, who summoned him to the tumult of cities
      and synods, was too readily obeyed by the aspiring hermit. With
      the approbation of his uncle, he assumed the office, and acquired
      the fame, of a popular preacher. His comely person adorned the
      pulpit; the harmony of his voice resounded in the cathedral; his
      friends were stationed to lead or second the applause of the
      congregation; 22 and the hasty notes of the scribes preserved his
      discourses, which in their effect, though not in their
      composition, might be compared with those of the Athenian
      orators. The death of Theophilus expanded and realized the hopes
      of his nephew. The clergy of Alexandria was divided; the soldiers
      and their general supported the claims of the archdeacon; but a
      resistless multitude, with voices and with hands, asserted the
      cause of their favorite; and after a period of thirty-nine years,
      Cyril was seated on the throne of Athanasius. 23

      Chapter XLVII: Ecclesiastical Discord.—Part II.

      The prize was not unworthy of his ambition. At a distance from
      the court, and at the head of an immense capital, the patriarch,
      as he was now styled, of Alexandria had gradually usurped the
      state and authority of a civil magistrate. The public and private
      charities of the city were blindly obeyed by his numerous and
      fanatic parabolani, 24 familiarized in their daily office with
      scenes of death; and the praefects of Egypt were awed or provoked
      by the temporal power of these Christian pontiffs. Ardent in the
      prosecution of heresy, Cyril auspiciously opened his reign by
      oppressing the Novatians, the most innocent and harmless of the
      sectaries. The interdiction of their religious worship appeared
      in his eyes a just and meritorious act; and he confiscated their
      holy vessels, without apprehending the guilt of sacrilege. The
      toleration, and even the privileges of the Jews, who had
      multiplied to the number of forty thousand, were secured by the
      laws of the Caesars and Ptolemies, and a long prescription of
      seven hundred years since the foundation of Alexandria. Without
      any legal sentence, without any royal mandate, the patriarch, at
      the dawn of day, led a seditious multitude to the attack of the
      synagogues. Unarmed and unprepared, the Jews were incapable of
      resistance; their houses of prayer were levelled with the ground,
      and the episcopal warrior, after rewarding his troops with the
      plunder of their goods, expelled from the city the remnant of the
      unbelieving nation. Perhaps he might plead the insolence of their
      prosperity, and their deadly hatred of the Christians, whose
      blood they had recently shed in a malicious or accidental tumult.

      Such crimes would have deserved the animadversion of the
      magistrate; but in this promiscuous outrage, the innocent were
      confounded with the guilty, and Alexandria was impoverished by
      the loss of a wealthy and industrious colony. The zeal of Cyril
      exposed him to the penalties of the Julian law; but in a feeble
      government and a superstitious age, he was secure of impunity,
      and even of praise. Orestes complained; but his just complaints
      were too quickly forgotten by the ministers of Theodosius, and
      too deeply remembered by a priest who affected to pardon, and
      continued to hate, the praefect of Egypt. As he passed through
      the streets, his chariot was assaulted by a band of five hundred
      of the Nitrian monks; his guards fled from the wild beasts of the
      desert; his protestations that he was a Christian and a Catholic
      were answered by a volley of stones, and the face of Orestes was
      covered with blood. The loyal citizens of Alexandria hastened to
      his rescue; he instantly satisfied his justice and revenge
      against the monk by whose hand he had been wounded, and Ammonius
      expired under the rod of the lictor. At the command of Cyril his
      body was raised from the ground, and transported, in solemn
      procession, to the cathedral; the name of Ammonius was changed to
      that of Thaumasius the wonderful; his tomb was decorated with the
      trophies of martyrdom, and the patriarch ascended the pulpit to
      celebrate the magnanimity of an assassin and a rebel. Such honors
      might incite the faithful to combat and die under the banners of
      the saint; and he soon prompted, or accepted, the sacrifice of a
      virgin, who professed the religion of the Greeks, and cultivated
      the friendship of Orestes. Hypatia, the daughter of Theon the
      mathematician, 25 was initiated in her father’s studies; her
      learned comments have elucidated the geometry of Apollonius and
      Diophantus, and she publicly taught, both at Athens and
      Alexandria, the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. In the bloom
      of beauty, and in the maturity of wisdom, the modest maid refused
      her lovers and instructed her disciples; the persons most
      illustrious for their rank or merit were impatient to visit the
      female philosopher; and Cyril beheld, with a jealous eye, the
      gorgeous train of horses and slaves who crowded the door of her
      academy. A rumor was spread among the Christians, that the
      daughter of Theon was the only obstacle to the reconciliation of
      the praefect and the archbishop; and that obstacle was speedily
      removed. On a fatal day, in the holy season of Lent, Hypatia was
      torn from her chariot, stripped naked, dragged to the church, and
      inhumanly butchered by the hands of Peter the reader, and a troop
      of savage and merciless fanatics: her flesh was scraped from her
      bones with sharp cyster shells, 26 and her quivering limbs were
      delivered to the flames. The just progress of inquiry and
      punishment was stopped by seasonable gifts; but the murder of
      Hypatia has imprinted an indelible stain on the character and
      religion of Cyril of Alexandria. 27

      24 (return) [ The Parabolani of Alexandria were a charitable
      corporation, instituted during the plague of Gallienus, to visit
      the sick and to bury the dead. They gradually enlarged, abused,
      and sold the privileges of their order. Their outrageous conduct
      during the reign of Cyril provoked the emperor to deprive the
      patriarch of their nomination, and to restrain their number to
      five or six hundred. But these restraints were transient and
      ineffectual. See the Theodosian Code, l. xvi. tit. ii. and

      epigram in the Greek Anthology (l. i. c. 76, p. 159, edit.
      Brodaei) celebrates her knowledge and eloquence. She is honorably
      mentioned (Epist. 10, 15 16, 33—80, 124, 135, 153) by her friend
      and disciple the philosophic bishop Synesius.]

      assassins were probably regardless, whether their victim was yet
      alive.]

      27 (return) [ These exploits of St. Cyril are recorded by
      Socrates, (l. vii. c. 13, 14, 15;) and the most reluctant bigotry
      is compelled to copy an historian who coolly styles the murderers
      of Hypatia. At the mention of that injured name, I am pleased to
      observe a blush even on the cheek of Baronius, (A.D. 415, No.
      48.)]

      Superstition, perhaps, would more gently expiate the blood of a
      virgin, than the banishment of a saint; and Cyril had accompanied
      his uncle to the iniquitous synod of the Oak. When the memory of
      Chrysostom was restored and consecrated, the nephew of
      Theophilus, at the head of a dying faction, still maintained the
      justice of his sentence; nor was it till after a tedious delay
      and an obstinate resistance, that he yielded to the consent of
      the Catholic world. 28 His enmity to the Byzantine pontiffs 29
      was a sense of interest, not a sally of passion: he envied their
      fortunate station in the sunshine of the Imperial court; and he
      dreaded their upstart ambition. which oppressed the metropolitans
      of Europe and Asia, invaded the provinces of Antioch and
      Alexandria, and measured their diocese by the limits of the
      empire. The long moderation of Atticus, the mild usurper of the
      throne of Chrysostom, suspended the animosities of the Eastern
      patriarchs; but Cyril was at length awakened by the exaltation of
      a rival more worthy of his esteem and hatred. After the short and
      troubled reign of Sisinnius, bishop of Constantinople, the
      factions of the clergy and people were appeased by the choice of
      the emperor, who, on this occasion, consulted the voice of fame,
      and invited the merit of a stranger.

      Nestorius, 30 native of Germanicia, and a monk of Antioch, was
      recommended by the austerity of his life, and the eloquence of
      his sermons; but the first homily which he preached before the
      devout Theodosius betrayed the acrimony and impatience of his
      zeal. “Give me, O Caesar!” he exclaimed, “give me the earth
      purged of heretics, and I will give you in exchange the kingdom
      of heaven. Exterminate with me the heretics; and with you I will
      exterminate the Persians.” On the fifth day as if the treaty had
      been already signed, the patriarch of Constantinople discovered,
      surprised, and attacked a secret conventicle of the Arians: they
      preferred death to submission; the flames that were kindled by
      their despair, soon spread to the neighboring houses, and the
      triumph of Nestorius was clouded by the name of incendiary. On
      either side of the Hellespont his episcopal vigor imposed a rigid
      formulary of faith and discipline; a chronological error
      concerning the festival of Easter was punished as an offence
      against the church and state. Lydia and Caria, Sardes and
      Miletus, were purified with the blood of the obstinate
      Quartodecimans; and the edict of the emperor, or rather of the
      patriarch, enumerates three-and-twenty degrees and denominations
      in the guilt and punishment of heresy. 31 But the sword of
      persecution which Nestorius so furiously wielded was soon turned
      against his own breast. Religion was the pretence; but, in the
      judgment of a contemporary saint, ambition was the genuine motive
      of episcopal warfare. 32

      28 (return) [ He was deaf to the entreaties of Atticus of

      muttered that John Chrysostom had been justly condemned,

      In the Syrian school, Nestorius had been taught to abhor the
      confusion of the two natures, and nicely to discriminate the
      humanity of his master Christ from the divinity of the Lord
      Jesus. 33 The Blessed Virgin he revered as the mother of Christ,
      but his ears were offended with the rash and recent title of
      mother of God, 34 which had been insensibly adopted since the
      origin of the Arian controversy. From the pulpit of
      Constantinople, a friend of the patriarch, and afterwards the
      patriarch himself, repeatedly preached against the use, or the
      abuse, of a word 35 unknown to the apostles, unauthorized by the
      church, and which could only tend to alarm the timorous, to
      misled the simple, to amuse the profane, and to justify, by a
      seeming resemblance, the old genealogy of Olympus. 36 In his
      calmer moments Nestorius confessed, that it might be tolerated or
      excused by the union of the two natures, and the communication of
      their idioms: 37 but he was exasperated, by contradiction, to
      disclaim the worship of a new-born, an infant Deity, to draw his
      inadequate similes from the conjugal or civil partnerships of
      life, and to describe the manhood of Christ as the robe, the
      instrument, the tabernacle of his Godhead. At these blasphemous
      sounds, the pillars of the sanctuary were shaken. The
      unsuccessful competitors of Nestorius indulged their pious or
      personal resentment, the Byzantine clergy was secretly displeased
      with the intrusion of a stranger: whatever is superstitious or
      absurd, might claim the protection of the monks; and the people
      were interested in the glory of their virgin patroness. 38 The
      sermons of the archbishop, and the service of the altar, were
      disturbed by seditious clamor; his authority and doctrine were
      renounced by separate congregations; every wind scattered round
      the empire the leaves of controversy; and the voice of the
      combatants on a sonorous theatre reechoed in the cells of
      Palestine and Egypt. It was the duty of Cyril to enlighten the
      zeal and ignorance of his innumerable monks: in the school of
      Alexandria, he had imbibed and professed the incarnation of one
      nature; and the successor of Athanasius consulted his pride and
      ambition, when he rose in arms against another Arius, more
      formidable and more guilty, on the second throne of the
      hierarchy. After a short correspondence, in which the rival
      prelates disguised their hatred in the hollow language of respect
      and charity, the patriarch of Alexandria denounced to the prince
      and people, to the East and to the West, the damnable errors of
      the Byzantine pontiff. From the East, more especially from
      Antioch, he obtained the ambiguous counsels of toleration and
      silence, which were addressed to both parties while they favored
      the cause of Nestorius. But the Vatican received with open arms
      the messengers of Egypt. The vanity of Celestine was flattered by
      the appeal; and the partial version of a monk decided the faith
      of the pope, who with his Latin clergy was ignorant of the
      language, the arts, and the theology of the Greeks. At the head
      of an Italian synod, Celestine weighed the merits of the cause,
      approved the creed of Cyril, condemned the sentiments and person
      of Nestorius, degraded the heretic from his episcopal dignity,
      allowed a respite of ten days for recantation and penance, and
      delegated to his enemy the execution of this rash and illegal
      sentence. But the patriarch of Alexandria, while he darted the
      thunders of a god, exposed the errors and passions of a mortal;
      and his twelve anathemas 39 still torture the orthodox slaves,
      who adore the memory of a saint, without forfeiting their
      allegiance to the synod of Chalcedon. These bold assertions are
      indelibly tinged with the colors of the Apollinarian heresy; but
      the serious, and perhaps the sincere professions of Nestorius
      have satisfied the wiser and less partial theologians of the
      present times. 40

      Yet neither the emperor nor the primate of the East were disposed
      to obey the mandate of an Italian priest; and a synod of the
      Catholic, or rather of the Greek church, was unanimously demanded
      as the sole remedy that could appease or decide this
      ecclesiastical quarrel. 41 Ephesus, on all sides accessible by
      sea and land, was chosen for the place, the festival of Pentecost
      for the day, of the meeting; a writ of summons was despatched to
      each metropolitan, and a guard was stationed to protect and
      confine the fathers till they should settle the mysteries of
      heaven, and the faith of the earth. Nestorius appeared not as a
      criminal, but as a judge; he depended on the weight rather than
      the number of his prelates, and his sturdy slaves from the baths
      of Zeuxippus were armed for every service of injury or defence.
      But his adversary Cyril was more powerful in the weapons both of
      the flesh and of the spirit. Disobedient to the letter, or at
      least to the meaning, of the royal summons, he was attended by
      fifty Egyptian bishops, who expected from their patriarch’s nod
      the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. He had contracted an intimate
      alliance with Memnon, bishop of Ephesus. The despotic primate of
      Asia disposed of the ready succors of thirty or forty episcopal
      votes: a crowd of peasants, the slaves of the church, was poured
      into the city to support with blows and clamors a metaphysical
      argument; and the people zealously asserted the honor of the
      Virgin, whose body reposed within the walls of Ephesus. 42 The
      fleet which had transported Cyril from Alexandria was laden with
      the riches of Egypt; and he disembarked a numerous body of
      mariners, slaves, and fanatics, enlisted with blind obedience
      under the banner of St. Mark and the mother of God. The fathers,
      and even the guards, of the council were awed by this martial
      array; the adversaries of Cyril and Mary were insulted in the
      streets, or threatened in their houses; his eloquence and
      liberality made a daily increase in the number of his adherents;
      and the Egyptian soon computed that he might command the
      attendance and the voices of two hundred bishops. 43 But the
      author of the twelve anathemas foresaw and dreaded the opposition
      of John of Antioch, who, with a small, but respectable, train of
      metropolitans and divines, was advancing by slow journeys from
      the distant capital of the East. Impatient of a delay, which he
      stigmatized as voluntary and culpable, 44 Cyril announced the
      opening of the synod sixteen days after the festival of
      Pentecost. Nestorius, who depended on the near approach of his
      Eastern friends, persisted, like his predecessor Chrysostom, to
      disclaim the jurisdiction, and to disobey the summons, of his
      enemies: they hastened his trial, and his accuser presided in the
      seat of judgment. Sixty-eight bishops, twenty-two of metropolitan
      rank, defended his cause by a modest and temperate protest: they
      were excluded from the councils of their brethren. Candidian, in
      the emperor’s name, requested a delay of four days; the profane
      magistrate was driven with outrage and insult from the assembly
      of the saints. The whole of this momentous transaction was
      crowded into the compass of a summer’s day: the bishops delivered
      their separate opinions; but the uniformity of style reveals the
      influence or the hand of a master, who has been accused of
      corrupting the public evidence of their acts and subscriptions.
      45 Without a dissenting voice, they recognized in the epistles of
      Cyril the Nicene creed and the doctrine of the fathers: but the
      partial extracts from the letters and homilies of Nestorius were
      interrupted by curses and anathemas: and the heretic was degraded
      from his episcopal and ecclesiastical dignity. The sentence,
      maliciously inscribed to the new Judas, was affixed and
      proclaimed in the streets of Ephesus: the weary prelates, as they
      issued from the church of the mother of God, were saluted as her
      champions; and her victory was celebrated by the illuminations,
      the songs, and the tumult of the night.

      same ground enumerates above 260 parasangs or leagues; and this
      measure might be illustrated from ancient and modern itineraries,
      if I knew how to compare the speed of an army, a synod, and a
      caravan. John of Antioch is reluctantly acquitted by Tillemont

      by Count Irenaeus, (tom. iii. p. 1249;) and the orthodox critics

      Latin copies of the Acts.]

      On the fifth day, the triumph was clouded by the arrival and
      indignation of the Eastern bishops. In a chamber of the inn,
      before he had wiped the dust from his shoes, John of Antioch gave
      audience to Candidian, the Imperial minister; who related his
      ineffectual efforts to prevent or to annul the hasty violence of
      the Egyptian. With equal haste and violence, the Oriental synod
      of fifty bishops degraded Cyril and Memnon from their episcopal
      honors, condemned, in the twelve anathemas, the purest venom of
      the Apollinarian heresy, and described the Alexandrian primate as
      a monster, born and educated for the destruction of the church.
      46 His throne was distant and inaccessible; but they instantly
      resolved to bestow on the flock of Ephesus the blessing of a
      faithful shepherd. By the vigilance of Memnon, the churches were
      shut against them, and a strong garrison was thrown into the
      cathedral. The troops, under the command of Candidian, advanced
      to the assault; the outguards were routed and put to the sword,
      but the place was impregnable: the besiegers retired; their
      retreat was pursued by a vigorous sally; they lost their horses,
      and many of their soldiers were dangerously wounded with clubs
      and stones. Ephesus, the city of the Virgin, was defiled with
      rage and clamor, with sedition and blood; the rival synods darted
      anathemas and excommunications from their spiritual engines; and
      the court of Theodosius was perplexed by the adverse and
      contradictory narratives of the Syrian and Egyptian factions.
      During a busy period of three months, the emperor tried every
      method, except the most effectual means of indifference and
      contempt, to reconcile this theological quarrel. He attempted to
      remove or intimidate the leaders by a common sentence, of
      acquittal or condemnation; he invested his representatives at
      Ephesus with ample power and military force; he summoned from
      either party eight chosen deputies to a free and candid
      conference in the neighborhood of the capital, far from the
      contagion of popular frenzy. But the Orientals refused to yield,
      and the Catholics, proud of their numbers and of their Latin
      allies, rejected all terms of union or toleration. The patience
      of the meek Theodosius was provoked; and he dissolved in anger
      this episcopal tumult, which at the distance of thirteen
      centuries assumes the venerable aspect of the third oecumenical
      council. 47 “God is my witness,” said the pious prince, “that I
      am not the author of this confusion. His providence will discern
      and punish the guilty. Return to your provinces, and may your
      private virtues repair the mischief and scandal of your meeting.”
      They returned to their provinces; but the same passions which had
      distracted the synod of Ephesus were diffused over the Eastern
      world. After three obstinate and equal campaigns, John of Antioch
      and Cyril of Alexandria condescended to explain and embrace: but
      their seeming reunion must be imputed rather to prudence than to
      reason, to the mutual lassitude rather than to the Christian
      charity of the patriarchs.

      46 (return) [ After the coalition of John and Cyril these
      invectives were mutually forgotten. The style of declamation must
      never be confounded with the genuine sense which respectable
      enemies entertain of each other’s merit, (Concil tom. iii. p.
      1244.)]

      47 (return) [ See the acts of the synod of Ephesus in the
      original Greek, and a Latin version almost contemporary, (Concil.
      tom. iii. p. 991—1339, with the Synodicon adversus Tragoediam
      Irenaei, tom. iv. p. 235—497,) the Ecclesiastical Histories of

      and the Memoires Eccles. of Tillemont, (tom. xiv p. 377-487.)]

      The Byzantine pontiff had instilled into the royal ear a baleful
      prejudice against the character and conduct of his Egyptian
      rival. An epistle of menace and invective, 48 which accompanied
      the summons, accused him as a busy, insolent, and envious priest,
      who perplexed the simplicity of the faith, violated the peace of
      the church and state, and, by his artful and separate addresses
      to the wife and sister of Theodosius, presumed to suppose, or to
      scatter, the seeds of discord in the Imperial family. At the
      stern command of his sovereign, Cyril had repaired to Ephesus,
      where he was resisted, threatened, and confined, by the
      magistrates in the interest of Nestorius and the Orientals; who
      assembled the troops of Lydia and Ionia to suppress the fanatic
      and disorderly train of the patriarch. Without expecting the
      royal license, he escaped from his guards, precipitately
      embarked, deserted the imperfect synod, and retired to his
      episcopal fortress of safety and independence. But his artful
      emissaries, both in the court and city, successfully labored to
      appease the resentment, and to conciliate the favor, of the
      emperor. The feeble son of Arcadius was alternately swayed by his
      wife and sister, by the eunuchs and women of the palace:
      superstition and avarice were their ruling passions; and the
      orthodox chiefs were assiduous in their endeavors to alarm the
      former, and to gratify the latter. Constantinople and the suburbs
      were sanctified with frequent monasteries, and the holy abbots,
      Dalmatius and Eutyches, 49 had devoted their zeal and fidelity to
      the cause of Cyril, the worship of Mary, and the unity of Christ.
      From the first moment of their monastic life, they had never
      mingled with the world, or trod the profane ground of the city.
      But in this awful moment of the danger of the church, their vow
      was superseded by a more sublime and indispensable duty. At the
      head of a long order of monks and hermits, who carried burning
      tapers in their hands, and chanted litanies to the mother of God,
      they proceeded from their monasteries to the palace. The people
      was edified and inflamed by this extraordinary spectacle, and the
      trembling monarch listened to the prayers and adjurations of the
      saints, who boldly pronounced, that none could hope for
      salvation, unless they embraced the person and the creed of the
      orthodox successor of Athanasius. At the same time, every avenue
      of the throne was assaulted with gold. Under the decent names of
      eulogies and benedictions, the courtiers of both sexes were
      bribed according to the measure of their power and rapaciousness.
      But their incessant demands despoiled the sanctuaries of
      Constantinople and Alexandria; and the authority of the patriarch
      was unable to silence the just murmur of his clergy, that a debt
      of sixty thousand pounds had already been contracted to support
      the expense of this scandalous corruption. 50 Pulcheria, who
      relieved her brother from the weight of an empire, was the
      firmest pillar of orthodoxy; and so intimate was the alliance
      between the thunders of the synod and the whispers of the court,
      that Cyril was assured of success if he could displace one
      eunuch, and substitute another in the favor of Theodosius. Yet
      the Egyptian could not boast of a glorious or decisive victory.
      The emperor, with unaccustomed firmness, adhered to his promise
      of protecting the innocence of the Oriental bishops; and Cyril
      softened his anathemas, and confessed, with ambiguity and
      reluctance, a twofold nature of Christ, before he was permitted
      to satiate his revenge against the unfortunate Nestorius. 51

      lines.]

      The rash and obstinate Nestorius, before the end of the synod,
      was oppressed by Cyril, betrayed by the court, and faintly
      supported by his Eastern friends. A sentiment of fear or
      indignation prompted him, while it was yet time, to affect the
      glory of a voluntary abdication: 52 his wish, or at least his
      request, was readily granted; he was conducted with honor from
      Ephesus to his old monastery of Antioch; and, after a short
      pause, his successors, Maximian and Proclus, were acknowledged as
      the lawful bishops of Constantinople. But in the silence of his
      cell, the degraded patriarch could no longer resume the innocence
      and security of a private monk. The past he regretted, he was
      discontented with the present, and the future he had reason to
      dread: the Oriental bishops successively disengaged their cause
      from his unpopular name, and each day decreased the number of the
      schismatics who revered Nestorius as the confessor of the faith.
      After a residence at Antioch of four years, the hand of
      Theodosius subscribed an edict, 53 which ranked him with Simon
      the magician, proscribed his opinions and followers, condemned
      his writings to the flames, and banished his person first to
      Petra, in Arabia, and at length to Oasis, one of the islands of
      the Libyan desert. 54 Secluded from the church and from the
      world, the exile was still pursued by the rage of bigotry and
      war. A wandering tribe of the Blemmyes or Nubians invaded his
      solitary prison: in their retreat they dismissed a crowd of
      useless captives: but no sooner had Nestorius reached the banks
      of the Nile, than he would gladly have escaped from a Roman and
      orthodox city, to the milder servitude of the savages. His flight
      was punished as a new crime: the soul of the patriarch inspired
      the civil and ecclesiastical powers of Egypt; the magistrates,
      the soldiers, the monks, devoutly tortured the enemy of Christ
      and St. Cyril; and, as far as the confines of Aethiopia, the
      heretic was alternately dragged and recalled, till his aged body
      was broken by the hardships and accidents of these reiterated
      journeys. Yet his mind was still independent and erect; the
      president of Thebais was awed by his pastoral letters; he
      survived the Catholic tyrant of Alexandria, and, after sixteen
      years’ banishment, the synod of Chalcedon would perhaps have
      restored him to the honors, or at least to the communion, of the
      church. The death of Nestorius prevented his obedience to their
      welcome summons; 55 and his disease might afford some color to

      Egypt, known by the names of Chemnis, or Panopolis, or Akmim; 56

      to cast stones against his sepulchre, and to propagate the
      foolish tradition, that it was never watered by the rain of
      heaven, which equally descends on the righteous and the ungodly.

      Chapter XLVII: Ecclesiastical Discord.—Part III.

      The death of the Alexandrian primate, after a reign of thirty-two
      years, abandoned the Catholics to the intemperance of zeal and
      the abuse of victory. 59 The monophysite doctrine (one incarnate
      nature) was rigorously preached in the churches of Egypt and the
      monasteries of the East; the primitive creed of Apollinarius was
      protected by the sanctity of Cyril; and the name of Eutyches, his
      venerable friend, has been applied to the sect most adverse to
      the Syrian heresy of Nestorius. His rival Eutyches was the abbot,
      or archimandrite, or superior of three hundred monks, but the
      opinions of a simple and illiterate recluse might have expired in
      the cell, where he had slept above seventy years, if the
      resentment or indiscretion of Flavian, the Byzantine pontiff, had
      not exposed the scandal to the eyes of the Christian world. His
      domestic synod was instantly convened, their proceedings were
      sullied with clamor and artifice, and the aged heretic was
      surprised into a seeming confession, that Christ had not derived
      his body from the substance of the Virgin Mary. From their
      partial decree, Eutyches appealed to a general council; and his
      cause was vigorously asserted by his godson Chrysaphius, the
      reigning eunuch of the palace, and his accomplice Dioscorus, who
      had succeeded to the throne, the creed, the talents, and the
      vices, of the nephew of Theophilus. By the special summons of
      Theodosius, the second synod of Ephesus was judiciously composed
      of ten metropolitans and ten bishops from each of the six
      dioceses of the Eastern empire: some exceptions of favor or merit
      enlarged the number to one hundred and thirty-five; and the
      Syrian Barsumas, as the chief and representative of the monks,
      was invited to sit and vote with the successors of the apostles.
      But the despotism of the Alexandrian patriarch again oppressed
      the freedom of debate: the same spiritual and carnal weapons were
      again drawn from the arsenals of Egypt: the Asiatic veterans, a
      band of archers, served under the orders of Dioscorus; and the
      more formidable monks, whose minds were inaccessible to reason or
      mercy, besieged the doors of the cathedral. The general, and, as
      it should seem, the unconstrained voice of the fathers, accepted
      the faith and even the anathemas of Cyril; and the heresy of the
      two natures was formally condemned in the persons and writings of
      the most learned Orientals. “May those who divide Christ be
      divided with the sword, may they be hewn in pieces, may they be
      burned alive!” were the charitable wishes of a Christian synod.
      60 The innocence and sanctity of Eutyches were acknowledged
      without hesitation; but the prelates, more especially those of
      Thrace and Asia, were unwilling to depose their patriarch for the
      use or even the abuse of his lawful jurisdiction. They embraced
      the knees of Dioscorus, as he stood with a threatening aspect on
      the footstool of his throne, and conjured him to forgive the
      offences, and to respect the dignity, of his brother. “Do you
      mean to raise a sedition?” exclaimed the relentless tyrant.
      “Where are the officers?” At these words a furious multitude of
      monks and soldiers, with staves, and swords, and chains, burst
      into the church; the trembling bishops hid themselves behind the
      altar, or under the benches, and as they were not inspired with
      the zeal of martyrdom, they successively subscribed a blank
      paper, which was afterwards filled with the condemnation of the
      Byzantine pontiff. Flavian was instantly delivered to the wild
      beasts of this spiritual amphitheatre: the monks were stimulated
      by the voice and example of Barsumas to avenge the injuries of
      Christ: it is said that the patriarch of Alexandria reviled, and
      buffeted, and kicked, and trampled his brother of Constantinople:
      61 it is certain, that the victim, before he could reach the
      place of his exile, expired on the third day of the wounds and
      bruises which he had received at Ephesus. This second synod has
      been justly branded as a gang of robbers and assassins; yet the
      accusers of Dioscorus would magnify his violence, to alleviate
      the cowardice and inconstancy of their own behavior.

      The learned but cautious Jablonski did not always speak the whole
      truth. Cum Cyrillo lenius omnino egi, quam si tecum aut cum aliis
      rei hujus probe gnaris et aequis rerum aestimatoribus sermones

      able to roar, stretched out their hands. At Chalcedon, the
      Orientals disclaimed these exclamations: but the Egyptians more
      consistently declared. (Concil. tom. iv. p. 1012.)]

      61 (return) [ (Eusebius, bishop of Dorylaeum): and this testimony
      of Evagrius (l. ii. c. 2) is amplified by the historian Zonaras,
      (tom. ii. l. xiii. p. 44,) who affirms that Dioscorus kicked like
      a wild ass. But the language of Liberatus (Brev. c. 12, in
      Concil. tom. vi. p. 438) is more cautious; and the Acts of
      Chalcedon, which lavish the names of homicide, Cain, &c., do not
      justify so pointed a charge. The monk Barsumas is more
      particularly accused, (Concil. tom. iv. p. 1418.)]

      The faith of Egypt had prevailed: but the vanquished party was
      supported by the same pope who encountered without fear the
      hostile rage of Attila and Genseric. The theology of Leo, his
      famous tome or epistle on the mystery of the incarnation, had
      been disregarded by the synod of Ephesus: his authority, and that
      of the Latin church, was insulted in his legates, who escaped
      from slavery and death to relate the melancholy tale of the
      tyranny of Dioscorus and the martyrdom of Flavian. His provincial
      synod annulled the irregular proceedings of Ephesus; but as this
      step was itself irregular, he solicited the convocation of a
      general council in the free and orthodox provinces of Italy. From
      his independent throne, the Roman bishop spoke and acted without
      danger as the head of the Christians, and his dictates were
      obsequiously transcribed by Placidia and her son Valentinian; who
      addressed their Eastern colleague to restore the peace and unity
      of the church. But the pageant of Oriental royalty was moved with
      equal dexterity by the hand of the eunuch; and Theodosius could
      pronounce, without hesitation, that the church was already
      peaceful and triumphant, and that the recent flame had been
      extinguished by the just punishment of the Nestorians. Perhaps
      the Greeks would be still involved in the heresy of the
      Monophysites, if the emperor’s horse had not fortunately
      stumbled; Theodosius expired; his orthodox sister Pulcheria, with
      a nominal husband, succeeded to the throne; Chrysaphius was
      burnt, Dioscorus was disgraced, the exiles were recalled, and the
      tome of Leo was subscribed by the Oriental bishops. Yet the pope
      was disappointed in his favorite project of a Latin council: he
      disdained to preside in the Greek synod, which was speedily
      assembled at Nice in Bithynia; his legates required in a
      peremptory tone the presence of the emperor; and the weary
      fathers were transported to Chalcedon under the immediate eye of
      Marcian and the senate of Constantinople. A quarter of a mile
      from the Thracian Bosphorus, the church of St. Euphemia was built
      on the summit of a gentle though lofty ascent: the triple
      structure was celebrated as a prodigy of art, and the boundless
      prospect of the land and sea might have raised the mind of a
      sectary to the contemplation of the God of the universe. Six
      hundred and thirty bishops were ranged in order in the nave of
      the church; but the patriarchs of the East were preceded by the
      legates, of whom the third was a simple priest; and the place of
      honor was reserved for twenty laymen of consular or senatorian
      rank. The gospel was ostentatiously displayed in the centre, but
      the rule of faith was defined by the Papal and Imperial
      ministers, who moderated the thirteen sessions of the council of
      Chalcedon. 62 Their partial interposition silenced the
      intemperate shouts and execrations, which degraded the episcopal
      gravity; but, on the formal accusation of the legates, Dioscorus
      was compelled to descend from his throne to the rank of a
      criminal, already condemned in the opinion of his judges. The
      Orientals, less adverse to Nestorius than to Cyril, accepted the
      Romans as their deliverers: Thrace, and Pontus, and Asia, were
      exasperated against the murderer of Flavian, and the new
      patriarchs of Constantinople and Antioch secured their places by
      the sacrifice of their benefactor. The bishops of Palestine,
      Macedonia, and Greece, were attached to the faith of Cyril; but
      in the face of the synod, in the heat of the battle, the leaders,
      with their obsequious train, passed from the right to the left
      wing, and decided the victory by this seasonable desertion. Of
      the seventeen suffragans who sailed from Alexandria, four were
      tempted from their allegiance, and the thirteen, falling
      prostrate on the ground, implored the mercy of the council, with
      sighs and tears, and a pathetic declaration, that, if they
      yielded, they should be massacred, on their return to Egypt, by
      the indignant people. A tardy repentance was allowed to expiate
      the guilt or error of the accomplices of Dioscorus: but their
      sins were accumulated on his head; he neither asked nor hoped for
      pardon, and the moderation of those who pleaded for a general
      amnesty was drowned in the prevailing cry of victory and revenge.

      To save the reputation of his late adherents, some personal
      offences were skilfully detected; his rash and illegal
      excommunication of the pope, and his contumacious refusal (while
      he was detained a prisoner) to attend to the summons of the
      synod. Witnesses were introduced to prove the special facts of
      his pride, avarice, and cruelty; and the fathers heard with
      abhorrence, that the alms of the church were lavished on the
      female dancers, that his palace, and even his bath, was open to
      the prostitutes of Alexandria, and that the infamous Pansophia,
      or Irene, was publicly entertained as the concubine of the
      patriarch. 63

      62 (return) [ The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon (Concil. tom.
      iv. p. 761—2071) comprehend those of Ephesus, (p. 890—1189,)
      which again comprise the synod of Constantinople under Flavian,
      (p. 930—1072;) and at requires some attention to disengage this
      double involution. The whole business of Eutyches, Flavian, and
      Dioscorus, is related by Evagrius (l. i. c. 9—12, and l. ii. c.
      1, 2, 3, 4,) and Liberatus, (Brev. c. 11, 12, 13, 14.) Once more,
      and almost for the last time, I appeal to the diligence of
      Tillemont, (Mem. Eccles. tom. xv. p. 479-719.) The annals of
      Baronius and Pagi will accompany me much further on my long and
      laborious journey.]

      63 (return) [ (Concil. tom. iv. p. 1276.) A specimen of the wit
      and malice of the people is preserved in the Greek Anthology, (l.
      ii. c. 5, p. 188, edit. Wechel,) although the application was
      unknown to the editor Brodaeus. The nameless epigrammatist raises
      a tolerable pun, by confounding the episcopal salutation of
      “Peace be to all!” with the genuine or corrupted name of the
      bishop’s concubine: I am ignorant whether the patriarch, who
      seems to have been a jealous lover, is the Cimon of a preceding
      epigram, was viewed with envy and wonder by Priapus himself.]

      For these scandalous offences, Dioscorus was deposed by the
      synod, and banished by the emperor; but the purity of his faith
      was declared in the presence, and with the tacit approbation, of
      the fathers. Their prudence supposed rather than pronounced the
      heresy of Eutyches, who was never summoned before their tribunal;
      and they sat silent and abashed, when a bold Monophysite casting
      at their feet a volume of Cyril, challenged them to anathematize
      in his person the doctrine of the saint. If we fairly peruse the
      acts of Chalcedon as they are recorded by the orthodox party, 64
      we shall find that a great majority of the bishops embraced the
      simple unity of Christ; and the ambiguous concession that he was
      formed Of or From two natures, might imply either their previous
      existence, or their subsequent confusion, or some dangerous
      interval between the conception of the man and the assumption of
      the God. The Roman theology, more positive and precise, adopted
      the term most offensive to the ears of the Egyptians, that Christ
      existed In two natures; and this momentous particle 65 (which the
      memory, rather than the understanding, must retain) had almost
      produced a schism among the Catholic bishops. The tome of Leo had
      been respectfully, perhaps sincerely, subscribed; but they
      protested, in two successive debates, that it was neither
      expedient nor lawful to transgress the sacred landmarks which had
      been fixed at Nice, Constantinople, and Ephesus, according to the
      rule of Scripture and tradition. At length they yielded to the
      importunities of their masters; but their infallible decree,
      after it had been ratified with deliberate votes and vehement
      acclamations, was overturned in the next session by the
      opposition of the legates and their Oriental friends. It was in
      vain that a multitude of episcopal voices repeated in chorus,
      “The definition of the fathers is orthodox and immutable! The
      heretics are now discovered! Anathema to the Nestorians! Let them
      depart from the synod! Let them repair to Rome.” 66 The legates
      threatened, the emperor was absolute, and a committee of eighteen
      bishops prepared a new decree, which was imposed on the reluctant
      assembly. In the name of the fourth general council, the Christ
      in one person, but in two natures, was announced to the Catholic
      world: an invisible line was drawn between the heresy of
      Apollinaris and the faith of St. Cyril; and the road to paradise,
      a bridge as sharp as a razor, was suspended over the abyss by the
      master-hand of the theological artist. During ten centuries of
      blindness and servitude, Europe received her religious opinions
      from the oracle of the Vatican; and the same doctrine, already
      varnished with the rust of antiquity, was admitted without
      dispute into the creed of the reformers, who disclaimed the
      supremacy of the Roman pontiff. The synod of Chalcedon still
      triumphs in the Protestant churches; but the ferment of
      controversy has subsided, and the most pious Christians of the
      present day are ignorant, or careless, of their own belief
      concerning the mystery of the incarnation.

      64 (return) [ Those who reverence the infallibility of synods,

      present only the placid face of the synod, and discreetly slide
      over these embers, suppositos cineri doloso.]

      Far different was the temper of the Greeks and Egyptians under
      the orthodox reigns of Leo and Marcian. Those pious emperors
      enforced with arms and edicts the symbol of their faith; 67 and
      it was declared by the conscience or honor of five hundred
      bishops, that the decrees of the synod of Chalcedon might be
      lawfully supported, even with blood. The Catholics observed with
      satisfaction, that the same synod was odious both to the
      Nestorians and the Monophysites; 68 but the Nestorians were less
      angry, or less powerful, and the East was distracted by the
      obstinate and sanguinary zeal of the Monophysites. Jerusalem was
      occupied by an army of monks; in the name of the one incarnate
      nature, they pillaged, they burnt, they murdered; the sepulchre
      of Christ was defiled with blood; and the gates of the city were
      guarded in tumultuous rebellion against the troops of the
      emperor. After the disgrace and exile of Dioscorus, the Egyptians
      still regretted their spiritual father; and detested the
      usurpation of his successor, who was introduced by the fathers of
      Chalcedon. The throne of Proterius was supported by a guard of
      two thousand soldiers: he waged a five years’ war against the
      people of Alexandria; and on the first intelligence of the death
      of Marcian, he became the victim of their zeal. On the third day
      before the festival of Easter, the patriarch was besieged in the
      cathedral, and murdered in the baptistery. The remains of his
      mangled corpse were delivered to the flames, and his ashes to the
      wind; and the deed was inspired by the vision of a pretended
      angel: an ambitious monk, who, under the name of Timothy the Cat,
      69 succeeded to the place and opinions of Dioscorus. This deadly
      superstition was inflamed, on either side, by the principle and
      the practice of retaliation: in the pursuit of a metaphysical
      quarrel, many thousands 70 were slain, and the Christians of
      every degree were deprived of the substantial enjoyments of
      social life, and of the invisible gifts of baptism and the holy
      communion. Perhaps an extravagant fable of the times may conceal
      an allegorical picture of these fanatics, who tortured each other
      and themselves. “Under the consulship of Venantius and Celer,”
      says a grave bishop, “the people of Alexandria, and all Egypt,
      were seized with a strange and diabolical frenzy: great and
      small, slaves and freedmen, monks and clergy, the natives of the
      land, who opposed the synod of Chalcedon, lost their speech and
      reason, barked like dogs, and tore, with their own teeth the
      flesh from their hands and arms.” 71

      The disorders of thirty years at length produced the famous
      Henoticon 72 of the emperor Zeno, which in his reign, and in that
      of Anastasius, was signed by all the bishops of the East, under
      the penalty of degradation and exile, if they rejected or
      infringed this salutary and fundamental law. The clergy may smile
      or groan at the presumption of a layman who defines the articles
      of faith; yet if he stoops to the humiliating task, his mind is
      less infected by prejudice or interest, and the authority of the
      magistrate can only be maintained by the concord of the people.
      It is in ecclesiastical story, that Zeno appears least
      contemptible; and I am not able to discern any Manichaean or
      Eutychian guilt in the generous saying of Anastasius. That it was
      unworthy of an emperor to persecute the worshippers of Christ and
      the citizens of Rome. The Henoticon was most pleasing to the
      Egyptians; yet the smallest blemish has not been described by the
      jealous, and even jaundiced eyes of our orthodox schoolmen, and
      it accurately represents the Catholic faith of the incarnation,
      without adopting or disclaiming the peculiar terms of tenets of
      the hostile sects. A solemn anathema is pronounced against
      Nestorius and Eutyches; against all heretics by whom Christ is
      divided, or confounded, or reduced to a phantom. Without defining
      the number or the article of the word nature, the pure system of
      St. Cyril, the faith of Nice, Constantinople, and Ephesus, is
      respectfully confirmed; but, instead of bowing at the name of the
      fourth council, the subject is dismissed by the censure of all
      contrary doctrines, if any such have been taught either elsewhere
      or at Chalcedon. Under this ambiguous expression, the friends and
      the enemies of the last synod might unite in a silent embrace.
      The most reasonable Christians acquiesced in this mode of
      toleration; but their reason was feeble and inconstant, and their
      obedience was despised as timid and servile by the vehement
      spirit of their brethren. On a subject which engrossed the
      thoughts and discourses of men, it was difficult to preserve an
      exact neutrality; a book, a sermon, a prayer, rekindled the flame
      of controversy; and the bonds of communion were alternately
      broken and renewed by the private animosity of the bishops. The
      space between Nestorius and Eutyches was filled by a thousand
      shades of language and opinion; the acephali 73 of Egypt, and the
      Roman pontiffs, of equal valor, though of unequal strength, may
      be found at the two extremities of the theological scale. The
      acephali, without a king or a bishop, were separated above three
      hundred years from the patriarchs of Alexandria, who had accepted
      the communion of Constantinople, without exacting a formal
      condemnation of the synod of Chalcedon. For accepting the
      communion of Alexandria, without a formal approbation of the same
      synod, the patriarchs of Constantinople were anathematized by the
      popes. Their inflexible despotism involved the most orthodox of
      the Greek churches in this spiritual contagion, denied or doubted
      the validity of their sacraments, 74 and fomented, thirty-five
      years, the schism of the East and West, till they finally
      abolished the memory of four Byzantine pontiffs, who had dared to
      oppose the supremacy of St. Peter. 75 Before that period, the
      precarious truce of Constantinople and Egypt had been violated by
      the zeal of the rival prelates. Macedonius, who was suspected of
      the Nestorian heresy, asserted, in disgrace and exile, the synod
      of Chalcedon, while the successor of Cyril would have purchased
      its overthrow with a bribe of two thousand pounds of gold.

      offer of a medicine proves the disease, and numbers must have
      perished before the arrival of the Roman physician. Tillemont
      himself (Mem. Eccles. tom. xvi. p. 372, 642, &c.) is shocked at
      the proud, uncharitable temper of the popes; they are now glad,
      says he, to invoke St. Flavian of Antioch, St. Elias of
      Jerusalem, &c., to whom they refused communion whilst upon earth.

      iv. p. 1846.) This ecclesiastical record was therefore equivalent
      to the book of life.]

      In the fever of the times, the sense, or rather the sound of a
      syllable, was sufficient to disturb the peace of an empire. The
      Trisagion 76 (thrice holy,) “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of
      Hosts!” is supposed, by the Greeks, to be the identical hymn
      which the angels and cherubim eternally repeat before the throne
      of God, and which, about the middle of the fifth century, was
      miraculously revealed to the church of Constantinople. The
      devotion of Antioch soon added, “who was crucified for us!” and
      this grateful address, either to Christ alone, or to the whole
      Trinity, may be justified by the rules of theology, and has been
      gradually adopted by the Catholics of the East and West. But it
      had been imagined by a Monophysite bishop; 77 the gift of an
      enemy was at first rejected as a dire and dangerous blasphemy,
      and the rash innovation had nearly cost the emperor Anastasius
      his throne and his life. 78 The people of Constantinople was
      devoid of any rational principles of freedom; but they held, as a
      lawful cause of rebellion, the color of a livery in the races, or
      the color of a mystery in the schools. The Trisagion, with and
      without this obnoxious addition, was chanted in the cathedral by
      two adverse choirs, and when their lungs were exhausted, they had
      recourse to the more solid arguments of sticks and stones; the
      aggressors were punished by the emperor, and defended by the
      patriarch; and the crown and mitre were staked on the event of
      this momentous quarrel. The streets were instantly crowded with
      innumerable swarms of men, women, and children; the legions of
      monks, in regular array, marched, and shouted, and fought at
      their head, “Christians! this is the day of martyrdom: let us not
      desert our spiritual father; anathema to the Manichaean tyrant!
      he is unworthy to reign.” Such was the Catholic cry; and the
      galleys of Anastasius lay upon their oars before the palace, till
      the patriarch had pardoned his penitent, and hushed the waves of
      the troubled multitude. The triumph of Macedonius was checked by
      a speedy exile; but the zeal of his flock was again exasperated
      by the same question, “Whether one of the Trinity had been
      crucified?” On this momentous occasion, the blue and green
      factions of Constantinople suspended their discord, and the civil
      and military powers were annihilated in their presence. The keys
      of the city, and the standards of the guards, were deposited in
      the forum of Constantine, the principal station and camp of the
      faithful. Day and night they were incessantly busied either in
      singing hymns to the honor of their God, or in pillaging and
      murdering the servants of their prince. The head of his favorite
      monk, the friend, as they styled him, of the enemy of the Holy
      Trinity, was borne aloft on a spear; and the firebrands, which
      had been darted against heretical structures, diffused the
      undistinguishing flames over the most orthodox buildings. The
      statues of the emperor were broken, and his person was concealed
      in a suburb, till, at the end of three days, he dared to implore
      the mercy of his subjects. Without his diadem, and in the posture
      of a suppliant, Anastasius appeared on the throne of the circus.
      The Catholics, before his face, rehearsed their genuine
      Trisagion; they exulted in the offer, which he proclaimed by the
      voice of a herald, of abdicating the purple; they listened to the
      admonition, that, since all could not reign, they should
      previously agree in the choice of a sovereign; and they accepted
      the blood of two unpopular ministers, whom their master, without
      hesitation, condemned to the lions. These furious but transient
      seditions were encouraged by the success of Vitalian, who, with
      an army of Huns and Bulgarians, for the most part idolaters,
      declared himself the champion of the Catholic faith. In this
      pious rebellion he depopulated Thrace, besieged Constantinople,
      exterminated sixty-five thousand of his fellow-Christians, till
      he obtained the recall of the bishops, the satisfaction of the
      pope, and the establishment of the council of Chalcedon, an
      orthodox treaty, reluctantly signed by the dying Anastasius, and
      more faithfully performed by the uncle of Justinian. And such was
      the event of the first of the religious wars which have been
      waged in the name and by the disciples, of the God of peace. 79

      799) represent the history and doctrine of the Trisagion. In the
      twelve centuries between Isaiah and St. Proculs’s boy, who was
      taken up into heaven before the bishop and people of
      Constantinople, the song was considerably improved. The boy heard
      the angels sing, “Holy God! Holy strong! Holy immortal!”]

      dissertation of M. de Valois at the end of his Evagrius.]

      78 (return) [ The troubles under the reign of Anastasius must be
      gathered from the Chronicles of Victor, Marcellinus, and

      correct.]

      abstract of the two books of Theodore the Reader, the Acts of the
      Synods, and the Epistles of the Pope, (Concil. tom. v.) The
      series is continued with some disorder in the xvth and xvith
      tomes of the Memoires Ecclesiastiques of Tillemont. And here I
      must take leave forever of that incomparable guide—whose bigotry
      is overbalanced by the merits of erudition, diligence, veracity,
      and scrupulous minuteness. He was prevented by death from
      completing, as he designed, the vith century of the church and
      empire.]




      Chapter XLVII: Ecclesiastical Discord.—Part IV.

      Justinian has been already seen in the various lights of a
      prince, a conqueror, and a lawgiver: the theologian 80 still
      remains, and it affords an unfavorable prejudice, that his
      theology should form a very prominent feature of his portrait.
      The sovereign sympathized with his subjects in their
      superstitious reverence for living and departed saints: his Code,
      and more especially his Novels, confirm and enlarge the
      privileges of the clergy; and in every dispute between a monk and
      a layman, the partial judge was inclined to pronounce, that
      truth, and innocence, and justice, were always on the side of the
      church. In his public and private devotions, the emperor was
      assiduous and exemplary; his prayers, vigils, and fasts,
      displayed the austere penance of a monk; his fancy was amused by
      the hope, or belief, of personal inspiration; he had secured the
      patronage of the Virgin and St. Michael the archangel; and his
      recovery from a dangerous disease was ascribed to the miraculous
      succor of the holy martyrs Cosmas and Damian. The capital and the
      provinces of the East were decorated with the monuments of his
      religion; 81 and though the far greater part of these costly
      structures may be attributed to his taste or ostentation, the
      zeal of the royal architect was probably quickened by a genuine
      sense of love and gratitude towards his invisible benefactors.
      Among the titles of Imperial greatness, the name of Pious was
      most pleasing to his ear; to promote the temporal and spiritual
      interest of the church was the serious business of his life; and
      the duty of father of his country was often sacrificed to that of
      defender of the faith. The controversies of the times were
      congenial to his temper and understanding and the theological
      professors must inwardly deride the diligence of a stranger, who
      cultivated their art and neglected his own. “What can ye fear,”
      said a bold conspirator to his associates, “from your bigoted
      tyrant? Sleepless and unarmed, he sits whole nights in his
      closet, debating with reverend graybeards, and turning over the
      pages of ecclesiastical volumes.” 82 The fruits of these
      lucubrations were displayed in many a conference, where Justinian
      might shine as the loudest and most subtile of the disputants; in
      many a sermon, which, under the name of edicts and epistles,
      proclaimed to the empire the theology of their master. While the
      Barbarians invaded the provinces, while the victorious legion
      marched under the banners of Belisarius and Narses, the successor
      of Trajan, unknown to the camp, was content to vanquish at the
      head of a synod. Had he invited to these synods a disinterested
      and rational spectator, Justinian might have learned, “that
      religious controversy is the offspring of arrogance and folly;
      that true piety is most laudably expressed by silence and
      submission; that man, ignorant of his own nature, should not
      presume to scrutinize the nature of his God; and that it is
      sufficient for us to know, that power and benevolence are the
      perfect attributes of the Deity.” 83

      80 (return) [ The strain of the Anecdotes of Procopius, (c. 11,
      13, 18, 27, 28,) with the learned remarks of Alemannus, is
      confirmed, rather than contradicted, by the Acts of the Councils,
      the fourth book of Evagrius, and the complaints of the African
      Facundus, in his xiith book—de tribus capitulis, “cum videri
      doctus appetit importune...spontaneis quaestionibus ecclesiam
      turbat.” See Procop. de Bell. Goth. l. iii. c. 35.]

      81 (return) [ Procop. de Edificiis, l. i. c. 6, 7, &c., passim.]

      82 (return) [ Procop. de Bell. Goth. l. iii. c. 32. In the life
      of St. Eutychius (apud Aleman. ad Procop. Arcan. c. 18) the same
      character is given with a design to praise Justinian.]

      83 (return) [ For these wise and moderate sentiments, Procopius
      (de Bell. Goth. l. i. c. 3) is scourged in the preface of
      Alemannus, who ranks him among the political Christians—sed longe
      verius haeresium omnium sentinas, prorsusque Atheos—abominable
      Atheists, who preached the imitation of God’s mercy to man, (ad
      Hist. Arcan. c. 13.)]

      Toleration was not the virtue of the times, and indulgence to
      rebels has seldom been the virtue of princes. But when the prince
      descends to the narrow and peevish character of a disputant, he
      is easily provoked to supply the defect of argument by the
      plenitude of power, and to chastise without mercy the perverse
      blindness of those who wilfully shut their eyes against the light
      of demonstration. The reign of Justinian was a uniform yet
      various scene of persecution; and he appears to have surpassed
      his indolent predecessors, both in the contrivance of his laws
      and the rigor of their execution. The insufficient term of three
      months was assigned for the conversion or exile of all heretics;
      84 and if he still connived at their precarious stay, they were
      deprived, under his iron yoke, not only of the benefits of
      society, but of the common birth-right of men and Christians. At
      the end of four hundred years, the Montanists of Phrygia 85 still
      breathed the wild enthusiasm of perfection and prophecy which
      they had imbibed from their male and female apostles, the special
      organs of the Paraclete. On the approach of the Catholic priests
      and soldiers, they grasped with alacrity the crown of martyrdom
      the conventicle and the congregation perished in the flames, but
      these primitive fanatics were not extinguished three hundred
      years after the death of their tyrant. Under the protection of
      their Gothic confederates, the church of the Arians at
      Constantinople had braved the severity of the laws: their clergy
      equalled the wealth and magnificence of the senate; and the gold
      and silver which were seized by the rapacious hand of Justinian
      might perhaps be claimed as the spoils of the provinces, and the
      trophies of the Barbarians. A secret remnant of Pagans, who still
      lurked in the most refined and most rustic conditions of mankind,
      excited the indignation of the Christians, who were perhaps
      unwilling that any strangers should be the witnesses of their
      intestine quarrels. A bishop was named as the inquisitor of the
      faith, and his diligence soon discovered, in the court and city,
      the magistrates, lawyers, physicians, and sophists, who still
      cherished the superstition of the Greeks. They were sternly
      informed that they must choose without delay between the
      displeasure of Jupiter or Justinian, and that their aversion to
      the gospel could no longer be distinguished under the scandalous
      mask of indifference or impiety. The patrician Photius, perhaps,
      alone was resolved to live and to die like his ancestors: he
      enfranchised himself with the stroke of a dagger, and left his
      tyrant the poor consolation of exposing with ignominy the
      lifeless corpse of the fugitive. His weaker brethren submitted to
      their earthly monarch, underwent the ceremony of baptism, and
      labored, by their extraordinary zeal, to erase the suspicion, or
      to expiate the guilt, of idolatry. The native country of Homer,
      and the theatre of the Trojan war, still retained the last sparks
      of his mythology: by the care of the same bishop, seventy
      thousand Pagans were detected and converted in Asia, Phrygia,
      Lydia, and Caria; ninety-six churches were built for the new
      proselytes; and linen vestments, Bibles, and liturgies, and vases
      of gold and silver, were supplied by the pious munificence of
      Justinian. 86 The Jews, who had been gradually stripped of their
      immunities, were oppressed by a vexatious law, which compelled
      them to observe the festival of Easter the same day on which it
      was celebrated by the Christians. 87 And they might complain with
      the more reason, since the Catholics themselves did not agree
      with the astronomical calculations of their sovereign: the people
      of Constantinople delayed the beginning of their Lent a whole
      week after it had been ordained by authority; and they had the
      pleasure of fasting seven days, while meat was exposed for sale
      by the command of the emperor. The Samaritans of Palestine 88
      were a motley race, an ambiguous sect, rejected as Jews by the
      Pagans, by the Jews as schismatics, and by the Christians as
      idolaters. The abomination of the cross had already been planted
      on their holy mount of Garizim, 89 but the persecution of
      Justinian offered only the alternative of baptism or rebellion.
      They chose the latter: under the standard of a desperate leader,
      they rose in arms, and retaliated their wrongs on the lives, the
      property, and the temples, of a defenceless people. The
      Samaritans were finally subdued by the regular forces of the
      East: twenty thousand were slain, twenty thousand were sold by
      the Arabs to the infidels of Persia and India, and the remains of
      that unhappy nation atoned for the crime of treason by the sin of
      hypocrisy. It has been computed that one hundred thousand Roman
      subjects were extirpated in the Samaritan war, 90 which converted
      the once fruitful province into a desolate and smoking
      wilderness. But in the creed of Justinian, the guilt of murder
      could not be applied to the slaughter of unbelievers; and he
      piously labored to establish with fire and sword the unity of the
      Christian faith. 91

      84 (return) [ This alternative, a precious circumstance, is
      preserved by John Malala, (tom. ii. p. 63, edit. Venet. 1733,)
      who deserves more credit as he draws towards his end. After
      numbering the heretics, Nestorians, Eutychians, &c., ne
      expectent, says Justinian, ut digni venia judicen tur: jubemus,
      enim ut...convicti et aperti haeretici justae et idoneae
      animadversioni subjiciantur. Baronius copies and applauds this
      edict of the Code, (A.D. 527, No. 39, 40.)]

      Alexandria, with the annual proclamation of Easter; and we still
      read, or rather we do not read, many of the Paschal epistles of
      St. Cyril. Since the reign of Monophytism in Egypt, the Catholics
      were perplexed by such a foolish prejudice as that which so long
      opposed, among the Protestants, the reception of the Gregorian

      With these sentiments, it was incumbent on him, at least, to be
      always in the right. In the first years of his administration, he
      signalized his zeal as the disciple and patron of orthodoxy: the
      reconciliation of the Greeks and Latins established the tome of
      St. Leo as the creed of the emperor and the empire; the
      Nestorians and Eutychians were exposed. on either side, to the
      double edge of persecution; and the four synods of Nice,
      Constantinople, Ephesus, and Chalcedon, were ratified by the code
      of a Catholic lawgiver. 92 But while Justinian strove to maintain
      the uniformity of faith and worship, his wife Theodora, whose
      vices were not incompatible with devotion, had listened to the
      Monophysite teachers; and the open or clandestine enemies of the
      church revived and multiplied at the smile of their gracious
      patroness. The capital, the palace, the nuptial bed, were torn by
      spiritual discord; yet so doubtful was the sincerity of the royal
      consorts, that their seeming disagreement was imputed by many to
      a secret and mischievous confederacy against the religion and
      happiness of their people. 93 The famous dispute of the Three



      Chapters, 94 which has filled more volumes than it deserves
      lines, is deeply marked with this subtile and disingenuous
      spirit. It was now three hundred years since the body of Origen
      95 had been eaten by the worms: his soul, of which he held the
      preexistence, was in the hands of its Creator; but his writings
      were eagerly perused by the monks of Palestine. In these
      writings, the piercing eye of Justinian descried more than ten
      metaphysical errors; and the primitive doctor, in the company of
      Pythagoras and Plato, was devoted by the clergy to the eternity
      of hell-fire, which he had presumed to deny. Under the cover of
      this precedent, a treacherous blow was aimed at the council of
      Chalcedon. The fathers had listened without impatience to the
      praise of Theodore of Mopsuestia; 96 and their justice or
      indulgence had restored both Theodore of Cyrrhus, and Ibas of
      Edessa, to the communion of the church. But the characters of
      these Oriental bishops were tainted with the reproach of heresy;
      the first had been the master, the two others were the friends,
      of Nestorius; their most suspicious passages were accused under
      the title of the three chapters; and the condemnation of their
      memory must involve the honor of a synod, whose name was
      pronounced with sincere or affected reverence by the Catholic
      world. If these bishops, whether innocent or guilty, were
      annihilated in the sleep of death, they would not probably be
      awakened by the clamor which, after a hundred years, was raised
      over their grave. If they were already in the fangs of the
      daemon, their torments could neither be aggravated nor assuaged
      by human industry. If in the company of saints and angels they
      enjoyed the rewards of piety, they must have smiled at the idle
      fury of the theological insects who still crawled on the surface
      of the earth. The foremost of these insects, the emperor of the
      Romans, darted his sting, and distilled his venom, perhaps
      without discerning the true motives of Theodora and her
      ecclesiastical faction. The victims were no longer subject to his
      power, and the vehement style of his edicts could only proclaim
      their damnation, and invite the clergy of the East to join in a
      full chorus of curses and anathemas. The East, with some
      hesitation, consented to the voice of her sovereign: the fifth
      general council, of three patriarchs and one hundred and
      sixty-five bishops, was held at Constantinople; and the authors,
      as well as the defenders, of the three chapters were separated
      from the communion of the saints, and solemnly delivered to the
      prince of darkness. But the Latin churches were more jealous of
      the honor of Leo and the synod of Chalcedon: and if they had
      fought as they usually did under the standard of Rome, they might
      have prevailed in the cause of reason and humanity. But their
      chief was a prisoner in the hands of the enemy; the throne of St.
      Peter, which had been disgraced by the simony, was betrayed by
      the cowardice, of Vigilius, who yielded, after a long and
      inconsistent struggle, to the despotism of Justinian and the
      sophistry of the Greeks. His apostasy provoked the indignation of
      the Latins, and no more than two bishops could be found who would
      impose their hands on his deacon and successor Pelagius. Yet the
      perseverance of the popes insensibly transferred to their
      adversaries the appellation of schismatics; the Illyrian,
      African, and Italian churches were oppressed by the civil and
      ecclesiastical powers, not without some effort of military force;
      97 the distant Barbarians transcribed the creed of the Vatican,
      and, in the period of a century, the schism of the three chapters
      expired in an obscure angle of the Venetian province. 98 But the
      religious discontent of the Italians had already promoted the
      conquests of the Lombards, and the Romans themselves were
      accustomed to suspect the faith and to detest the government of
      their Byzantine tyrant.

      contemptuous silence, (xiii. Concil. Toretan. in Concil. tom.

      Justinian was neither steady nor consistent in the nice process
      of fixing his volatile opinions and those of his subjects. In his
      youth he was, offended by the slightest deviation from the
      orthodox line; in his old age he transgressed the measure of
      temperate heresy, and the Jacobites, not less than the Catholics,
      were scandalized by his declaration, that the body of Christ was
      incorruptible, and that his manhood was never subject to any
      wants and infirmities, the inheritance of our mortal flesh. This
      fantastic opinion was announced in the last edicts of Justinian;
      and at the moment of his seasonable departure, the clergy had
      refused to subscribe, the prince was prepared to persecute, and
      the people were resolved to suffer or resist. A bishop of Treves,
      secure beyond the limits of his power, addressed the monarch of
      the East in the language of authority and affection. “Most
      gracious Justinian, remember your baptism and your creed. Let not
      your gray hairs be defiled with heresy. Recall your fathers from
      exile, and your followers from perdition. You cannot be ignorant,
      that Italy and Gaul, Spain and Africa, already deplore your fall,
      and anathematize your name. Unless, without delay, you destroy
      what you have taught; unless you exclaim with a loud voice, I
      have erred, I have sinned, anathema to Nestorius, anathema to
      Eutyches, you deliver your soul to the same flames in which they
      will eternally burn.” He died and made no sign. 99 His death
      restored in some degree the peace of the church, and the reigns
      of his four successors, Justin Tiberius, Maurice, and Phocas, are
      distinguished by a rare, though fortunate, vacancy in the
      ecclesiastical history of the East. 100

      separated from the communion of the four patriarchs by his
      refusal to condemn the three chapters. Baronius almost pronounces
      the damnation of Justinian, (A.D. 565, No. 6.)]

      100 (return) [ After relating the last heresy of Justinian, (l.
      iv. c. 39, 40, 41,) and the edict of his successor, (l. v. c. 3,)

      instead of ecclesiastical events.]

      The faculties of sense and reason are least capable of acting on
      themselves; the eye is most inaccessible to the sight, the soul
      to the thought; yet we think, and even feel, that one will, a
      sole principle of action, is essential to a rational and
      conscious being. When Heraclius returned from the Persian war,
      the orthodox hero consulted his bishops, whether the Christ whom
      he adored, of one person, but of two natures, was actuated by a
      single or a double will. They replied in the singular, and the
      emperor was encouraged to hope that the Jacobites of Egypt and
      Syria might be reconciled by the profession of a doctrine, most
      certainly harmless, and most probably true, since it was taught
      even by the Nestorians themselves. 101 The experiment was tried
      without effect, and the timid or vehement Catholics condemned
      even the semblance of a retreat in the presence of a subtle and
      audacious enemy. The orthodox (the prevailing) party devised new
      modes of speech, and argument, and interpretation: to either
      nature of Christ they speciously applied a proper and distinct
      energy; but the difference was no longer visible when they
      allowed that the human and the divine will were invariably the
      same. 102 The disease was attended with the customary symptoms:
      but the Greek clergy, as if satiated with the endless controversy
      of the incarnation, instilled a healing counsel into the ear of
      the prince and people. They declared themselves Monothelites,
      (asserters of the unity of will,) but they treated the words as
      new, the questions as superfluous; and recommended a religious
      silence as the most agreeable to the prudence and charity of the
      gospel. This law of silence was successively imposed by the
      ecthesis or exposition of Heraclius, the type or model of his
      grandson Constans; 103 and the Imperial edicts were subscribed
      with alacrity or reluctance by the four patriarchs of Rome,
      Constantinople, Alexandria, and Antioch. But the bishop and monks
      of Jerusalem sounded the alarm: in the language, or even in the
      silence, of the Greeks, the Latin churches detected a latent
      heresy: and the obedience of Pope Honorius to the commands of his
      sovereign was retracted and censured by the bolder ignorance of
      his successors. They condemned the execrable and abominable
      heresy of the Monothelites, who revived the errors of Manes,
      Apollinaris, Eutyches, &c.; they signed the sentence of
      excommunication on the tomb of St. Peter; the ink was mingled
      with the sacramental wine, the blood of Christ; and no ceremony
      was omitted that could fill the superstitious mind with horror
      and affright. As the representative of the Western church, Pope
      Martin and his Lateran synod anathematized the perfidious and
      guilty silence of the Greeks: one hundred and five bishops of
      Italy, for the most part the subjects of Constans, presumed to
      reprobate his wicked type, and the impious ecthesis of his
      grandfather; and to confound the authors and their adherents with
      the twenty-one notorious heretics, the apostates from the church,
      and the organs of the devil. Such an insult under the tamest
      reign could not pass with impunity. Pope Martin ended his days on
      the inhospitable shore of the Tauric Chersonesus, and his oracle,
      the abbot Maximus, was inhumanly chastised by the amputation of
      his tongue and his right hand. 104 But the same invincible spirit
      survived in their successors; and the triumph of the Latins
      avenged their recent defeat, and obliterated the disgrace of the
      three chapters. The synods of Rome were confirmed by the sixth
      general council of Constantinople, in the palace and the presence
      of a new Constantine, a descendant of Heraclius. The royal
      convert converted the Byzantine pontiff and a majority of the
      bishops; 105 the dissenters, with their chief, Macarius of
      Antioch, were condemned to the spiritual and temporal pains of
      heresy; the East condescended to accept the lessons of the West;
      and the creed was finally settled, which teaches the Catholics of
      every age, that two wills or energies are harmonized in the
      person of Christ. The majesty of the pope and the Roman synod was
      represented by two priests, one deacon, and three bishops; but
      these obscure Latins had neither arms to compel, nor treasures to
      bribe, nor language to persuade; and I am ignorant by what arts
      they could determine the lofty emperor of the Greeks to abjure
      the catechism of his infancy, and to persecute the religion of
      his fathers. Perhaps the monks and people of Constantinople 106
      were favorable to the Lateran creed, which is indeed the least
      reasonable of the two: and the suspicion is countenanced by the
      unnatural moderation of the Greek clergy, who appear in this
      quarrel to be conscious of their weakness. While the synod
      debated, a fanatic proposed a more summary decision, by raising a
      dead man to life: the prelates assisted at the trial; but the
      acknowledged failure may serve to indicate, that the passions and
      prejudices of the multitude were not enlisted on the side of the
      Monothelites. In the next generation, when the son of Constantine
      was deposed and slain by the disciple of Macarius, they tasted
      the feast of revenge and dominion: the image or monument of the
      sixth council was defaced, and the original acts were committed
      to the flames. But in the second year, their patron was cast
      headlong from the throne, the bishops of the East were released
      from their occasional conformity, the Roman faith was more firmly
      replanted by the orthodox successors of Bardanes, and the fine
      problems of the incarnation were forgotten in the more popular
      and visible quarrel of the worship of images. 107

      this was a natural and transient emotion; and I much fear that
      the latter is an anticipation of the good people of
      Constantinople.]

      Acts of the Synods of Rome (tom. vii. p. 77—395, 601—608) and
      Constantinople, (p. 609—1429.) Baronius extracted some original
      documents from the Vatican library; and his chronology is

      Eccles. tom. vi. p. 57—71) and Basnage (Hist. de l’Eglise, tom.
      i. p. 451—555) afford a tolerable abridgment.]

      Before the end of the seventh century, the creed of the
      incarnation, which had been defined at Rome and Constantinople,
      was uniformly preached in the remote islands of Britain and
      Ireland; 108 the same ideas were entertained, or rather the same
      words were repeated, by all the Christians whose liturgy was
      performed in the Greek or the Latin tongue. Their numbers, and
      visible splendor, bestowed an imperfect claim to the appellation
      of Catholics: but in the East, they were marked with the less
      honorable name of Melchites, or Royalists; 109 of men, whose
      faith, instead of resting on the basis of Scripture, reason, or
      tradition, had been established, and was still maintained, by the
      arbitrary power of a temporal monarch. Their adversaries might
      allege the words of the fathers of Constantinople, who profess
      themselves the slaves of the king; and they might relate, with
      malicious joy, how the decrees of Chalcedon had been inspired and
      reformed by the emperor Marcian and his virgin bride. The
      prevailing faction will naturally inculcate the duty of
      submission, nor is it less natural that dissenters should feel
      and assert the principles of freedom. Under the rod of
      persecution, the Nestorians and Monophysites degenerated into
      rebels and fugitives; and the most ancient and useful allies of
      Rome were taught to consider the emperor not as the chief, but as
      the enemy of the Christians. Language, the leading principle
      which unites or separates the tribes of mankind, soon
      discriminated the sectaries of the East, by a peculiar and
      perpetual badge, which abolished the means of intercourse and the
      hope of reconciliation. The long dominion of the Greeks, their
      colonies, and, above all, their eloquence, had propagated a
      language doubtless the most perfect that has been contrived by
      the art of man. Yet the body of the people, both in Syria and
      Egypt, still persevered in the use of their national idioms; with
      this difference, however, that the Coptic was confined to the
      rude and illiterate peasants of the Nile, while the Syriac, 110
      from the mountains of Assyria to the Red Sea, was adapted to the
      higher topics of poetry and argument. Armenia and Abyssinia were
      infected by the speech or learning of the Greeks; and their
      Barbaric tongues, which have been revived in the studies of
      modern Europe, were unintelligible to the inhabitants of the
      Roman empire. The Syriac and the Coptic, the Armenian and the
      Aethiopic, are consecrated in the service of their respective
      churches: and their theology is enriched by domestic versions 111
      both of the Scriptures and of the most popular fathers. After a
      period of thirteen hundred and sixty years, the spark of
      controversy, first kindled by a sermon of Nestorius, still burns
      in the bosom of the East, and the hostile communions still
      maintain the faith and discipline of their founders. In the most
      abject state of ignorance, poverty, and servitude, the Nestorians
      and Monophysites reject the spiritual supremacy of Rome, and
      cherish the toleration of their Turkish masters, which allows
      them to anathematize, on the one hand, St. Cyril and the synod of
      Ephesus: on the other, Pope Leo and the council of Chalcedon. The
      weight which they cast into the downfall of the Eastern empire
      demands our notice, and the reader may be amused with the various
      prospect of, I. The Nestorians; II. The Jacobites; 112 III. The
      Maronites; IV. The Armenians; V. The Copts; and, VI. The
      Abyssinians. To the three former, the Syriac is common; but of
      the latter, each is discriminated by the use of a national idiom.

      Yet the modern natives of Armenia and Abyssinia would be
      incapable of conversing with their ancestors; and the Christians
      of Egypt and Syria, who reject the religion, have adopted the
      language of the Arabians. The lapse of time has seconded the
      sacerdotal arts; and in the East, as well as in the West, the
      Deity is addressed in an obsolete tongue, unknown to the majority
      of the congregation.

      Hatfield, in which he received the decrees of Pope Martin and the
      first Lateran council against the Monothelites, (Concil. tom.
      vii. p. 597, &c.) Theodore, a monk of Tarsus in Cilicia, had been
      named to the primacy of Britain by Pope Vitalian, (A.D. 688; see

      tainted by some distrust of his national character—ne quid
      contrarium veritati fidei, Graecorum more, in ecclesiam cui
      praeesset introduceret. The Cilician was sent from Rome to
      Canterbury under the tuition of an African guide, (Bedae Hist.
      Eccles. Anglorum. l. iv. c. 1.) He adhered to the Roman doctrine;
      and the same creed of the incarnation has been uniformly

      understanding is perhaps seldom engaged with that abstruse

      Chapter XLVII: Ecclesiastical Discord.—Part V.

      I. Both in his native and his episcopal province, the heresy of
      the unfortunate Nestorius was speedily obliterated. The Oriental
      bishops, who at Ephesus had resisted to his face the arrogance of
      Cyril, were mollified by his tardy concessions. The same
      prelates, or their successors, subscribed, not without a murmur,
      the decrees of Chalcedon; the power of the Monophysites
      reconciled them with the Catholics in the conformity of passion,
      of interest, and, insensibly, of belief; and their last reluctant
      sigh was breathed in the defence of the three chapters. Their
      dissenting brethren, less moderate, or more sincere, were crushed
      by the penal laws; and, as early as the reign of Justinian, it
      became difficult to find a church of Nestorians within the limits
      of the Roman empire. Beyond those limits they had discovered a
      new world, in which they might hope for liberty, and aspire to
      conquest. In Persia, notwithstanding the resistance of the Magi,
      Christianity had struck a deep root, and the nations of the East
      reposed under its salutary shade. The catholic, or primate,
      resided in the capital: in his synods, and in their dioceses, his
      metropolitans, bishops, and clergy, represented the pomp and
      order of a regular hierarchy: they rejoiced in the increase of
      proselytes, who were converted from the Zendavesta to the gospel,
      from the secular to the monastic life; and their zeal was
      stimulated by the presence of an artful and formidable enemy. The
      Persian church had been founded by the missionaries of Syria; and
      their language, discipline, and doctrine, were closely interwoven
      with its original frame. The catholics were elected and ordained
      by their own suffragans; but their filial dependence on the
      patriarchs of Antioch is attested by the canons of the Oriental
      church. 113 In the Persian school of Edessa, 114 the rising
      generations of the faithful imbibed their theological idiom: they
      studied in the Syriac version the ten thousand volumes of
      Theodore of Mopsuestia; and they revered the apostolic faith and
      holy martyrdom of his disciple Nestorius, whose person and
      language were equally unknown to the nations beyond the Tigris.
      The first indelible lesson of Ibas, bishop of Edessa, taught them
      to execrate the Egyptians, who, in the synod of Ephesus, had
      impiously confounded the two natures of Christ. The flight of the
      masters and scholars, who were twice expelled from the Athens of
      Syria, dispersed a crowd of missionaries inflamed by the double
      zeal of religion and revenge. And the rigid unity of the
      Monophysites, who, under the reigns of Zeno and Anastasius, had
      invaded the thrones of the East, provoked their antagonists, in a
      land of freedom, to avow a moral, rather than a physical, union
      of the two persons of Christ. Since the first preaching of the
      gospel, the Sassanian kings beheld with an eye of suspicion a
      race of aliens and apostates, who had embraced the religion, and
      who might favor the cause, of the hereditary foes of their
      country. The royal edicts had often prohibited their dangerous
      correspondence with the Syrian clergy: the progress of the schism
      was grateful to the jealous pride of Perozes, and he listened to
      the eloquence of an artful prelate, who painted Nestorius as the
      friend of Persia, and urged him to secure the fidelity of his
      Christian subjects, by granting a just preference to the victims
      and enemies of the Roman tyrant. The Nestorians composed a large
      majority of the clergy and people: they were encouraged by the
      smile, and armed with the sword, of despotism; yet many of their
      weaker brethren were startled at the thought of breaking loose
      from the communion of the Christian world, and the blood of seven
      thousand seven hundred Monophysites, or Catholics, confirmed the
      uniformity of faith and discipline in the churches of Persia. 115
      Their ecclesiastical institutions are distinguished by a liberal
      principle of reason, or at least of policy: the austerity of the
      cloister was relaxed and gradually forgotten; houses of charity
      were endowed for the education of orphans and foundlings; the law
      of celibacy, so forcibly recommended to the Greeks and Latins,
      was disregarded by the Persian clergy; and the number of the
      elect was multiplied by the public and reiterated nuptials of the
      priests, the bishops, and even the patriarch himself. To this
      standard of natural and religious freedom, myriads of fugitives
      resorted from all the provinces of the Eastern empire; the narrow
      bigotry of Justinian was punished by the emigration of his most
      industrious subjects; they transported into Persia the arts both
      of peace and war: and those who deserved the favor, were promoted
      in the service, of a discerning monarch. The arms of Nushirvan,
      and his fiercer grandson, were assisted with advice, and money,
      and troops, by the desperate sectaries who still lurked in their
      native cities of the East: their zeal was rewarded with the gift
      of the Catholic churches; but when those cities and churches were
      recovered by Heraclius, their open profession of treason and
      heresy compelled them to seek a refuge in the realm of their
      foreign ally. But the seeming tranquillity of the Nestorians was
      often endangered, and sometimes overthrown. They were involved in
      the common evils of Oriental despotism: their enmity to Rome
      could not always atone for their attachment to the gospel: and a
      colony of three hundred thousand Jacobites, the captives of
      Apamea and Antioch, was permitted to erect a hostile altar in the
      face of the catholic, and in the sunshine of the court. In his
      last treaty, Justinian introduced some conditions which tended to
      enlarge and fortify the toleration of Christianity in Persia. The
      emperor, ignorant of the rights of conscience, was incapable of
      pity or esteem for the heretics who denied the authority of the
      holy synods: but he flattered himself that they would gradually
      perceive the temporal benefits of union with the empire and the
      church of Rome; and if he failed in exciting their gratitude, he
      might hope to provoke the jealousy of their sovereign. In a later
      age the Lutherans have been burnt at Paris, and protected in
      Germany, by the superstition and policy of the most Christian
      king.

      The desire of gaining souls for God and subjects for the church,
      has excited in every age the diligence of the Christian priests.
      From the conquest of Persia they carried their spiritual arms to
      the north, the east, and the south; and the simplicity of the
      gospel was fashioned and painted with the colors of the Syriac
      theology. In the sixth century, according to the report of a
      Nestorian traveller, 116 Christianity was successfully preached
      to the Bactrians, the Huns, the Persians, the Indians, the
      Persarmenians, the Medes, and the Elamites: the Barbaric
      churches, from the Gulf of Persia to the Caspian Sea, were almost
      infinite; and their recent faith was conspicuous in the number
      and sanctity of their monks and martyrs. The pepper coast of
      Malabar, and the isles of the ocean, Socotora and Ceylon, were
      peopled with an increasing multitude of Christians; and the
      bishops and clergy of those sequestered regions derived their
      ordination from the Catholic of Babylon. In a subsequent age the
      zeal of the Nestorians overleaped the limits which had confined
      the ambition and curiosity both of the Greeks and Persians. The
      missionaries of Balch and Samarcand pursued without fear the
      footsteps of the roving Tartar, and insinuated themselves into
      the camps of the valleys of Imaus and the banks of the Selinga.
      They exposed a metaphysical creed to those illiterate shepherds:
      to those sanguinary warriors, they recommended humanity and
      repose. Yet a khan, whose power they vainly magnified, is said to
      have received at their hands the rites of baptism, and even of
      ordination; and the fame of Prester or Presbyter John 117 has
      long amused the credulity of Europe. The royal convert was
      indulged in the use of a portable altar; but he despatched an
      embassy to the patriarch, to inquire how, in the season of Lent,
      he should abstain from animal food, and how he might celebrate
      the Eucharist in a desert that produced neither corn nor wine. In
      their progress by sea and land, the Nestorians entered China by
      the port of Canton and the northern residence of Sigan. Unlike
      the senators of Rome, who assumed with a smile the characters of
      priests and augurs, the mandarins, who affect in public the
      reason of philosophers, are devoted in private to every mode of
      popular superstition. They cherished and they confounded the gods
      of Palestine and of India; but the propagation of Christianity
      awakened the jealousy of the state, and, after a short
      vicissitude of favor and persecution, the foreign sect expired in
      ignorance and oblivion. 118 Under the reign of the caliphs, the
      Nestorian church was diffused from China to Jerusalem and Cyrus;
      and their numbers, with those of the Jacobites, were computed to
      surpass the Greek and Latin communions. 119 Twenty-five
      metropolitans or archbishops composed their hierarchy; but
      several of these were dispensed, by the distance and danger of
      the way, from the duty of personal attendance, on the easy
      condition that every six years they should testify their faith
      and obedience to the catholic or patriarch of Babylon, a vague
      appellation which has been successively applied to the royal
      seats of Seleucia, Ctesiphon, and Bagdad. These remote branches
      are long since withered; and the old patriarchal trunk 120 is now
      divided by the Elijahs of Mosul, the representatives almost on
      lineal descent of the genuine and primitive succession; the
      Josephs of Amida, who are reconciled to the church of Rome: 121
      and the Simeons of Van or Ormia, whose revolt, at the head of
      forty thousand families, was promoted in the sixteenth century by
      the Sophis of Persia. The number of three hundred thousand is
      allowed for the whole body of the Nestorians, who, under the name
      of Chaldeans or Assyrians, are confounded with the most learned
      or the most powerful nation of Eastern antiquity.

      attempted to impeach, rather from hatred to the Jesuits, by whom
      it was made known, than by a candid examination of its contents,
      is now generally considered above all suspicion. The Chinese text
      and the facts which it relates are equally strong proofs of its
      authenticity. This monument was raised as a memorial of the
      establishment of Christianity in China. It is dated the year 1092
      of the era of the Greeks, or the Seleucidae, A.D. 781, in the
      time of the Nestorian patriarch Anan-jesu. It was raised by
      Iezdbouzid, priest and chorepiscopus of Chumdan, that is, of the
      capital of the Chinese empire, and the son of a priest who came
      from Balkh in Tokharistan. Among the various arguments which may
      be urged in favor of the authenticity of this monument, and which
      has not yet been advanced, may be reckoned the name of the priest
      by whom it was raised. The name is Persian, and at the time the
      monument was discovered, it would have been impossible to have
      imagined it; for there was no work extant from whence the
      knowledge of it could be derived. I do not believe that ever
      since this period, any book has been published in which it can be
      found a second time. It is very celebrated amongst the Armenians,
      and is derived from a martyr, a Persian by birth, of the royal
      race, who perished towards the middle of the seventh century, and
      rendered his name celebrated among the Christian nations of the
      East. St. Martin, vol. i. p. 69. M. Remusat has also strongly

      According to the legend of antiquity, the gospel was preached in
      India by St. Thomas. 122 At the end of the ninth century, his
      shrine, perhaps in the neighborhood of Madras, was devoutly
      visited by the ambassadors of Alfred; and their return with a
      cargo of pearls and spices rewarded the zeal of the English
      monarch, who entertained the largest projects of trade and
      discovery. 123 When the Portuguese first opened the navigation of
      India, the Christians of St. Thomas had been seated for ages on
      the coast of Malabar, and the difference of their character and
      color attested the mixture of a foreign race. In arms, in arts,
      and possibly in virtue, they excelled the natives of Hindostan;
      the husbandmen cultivated the palm-tree, the merchants were
      enriched by the pepper trade, the soldiers preceded the nairs or
      nobles of Malabar, and their hereditary privileges were respected
      by the gratitude or the fear of the king of Cochin and the
      Zamorin himself. They acknowledged a Gentoo of sovereign, but
      they were governed, even in temporal concerns, by the bishop of
      Angamala. He still asserted his ancient title of metropolitan of
      India, but his real jurisdiction was exercised in fourteen
      hundred churches, and he was intrusted with the care of two
      hundred thousand souls. Their religion would have rendered them
      the firmest and most cordial allies of the Portuguese; but the
      inquisitors soon discerned in the Christians of St. Thomas the
      unpardonable guilt of heresy and schism. Instead of owning
      themselves the subjects of the Roman pontiff, the spiritual and
      temporal monarch of the globe, they adhered, like their
      ancestors, to the communion of the Nestorian patriarch; and the
      bishops whom he ordained at Mosul, traversed the dangers of the
      sea and land to reach their diocese on the coast of Malabar. In
      their Syriac liturgy the names of Theodore and Nestorius were
      piously commemorated: they united their adoration of the two
      persons of Christ; the title of Mother of God was offensive to
      their ear, and they measured with scrupulous avarice the honors
      of the Virgin Mary, whom the superstition of the Latins had
      almost exalted to the rank of a goddess. When her image was first
      presented to the disciples of St. Thomas, they indignantly
      exclaimed, “We are Christians, not idolaters!” and their simple
      devotion was content with the veneration of the cross. Their
      separation from the Western world had left them in ignorance of
      the improvements, or corruptions, of a thousand years; and their
      conformity with the faith and practice of the fifth century would
      equally disappoint the prejudices of a Papist or a Protestant. It
      was the first care of the ministers of Rome to intercept all
      correspondence with the Nestorian patriarch, and several of his
      bishops expired in the prisons of the holy office.

      The flock, without a shepherd, was assaulted by the power of the
      Portuguese, the arts of the Jesuits, and the zeal of Alexis de
      Menezes, archbishop of Goa, in his personal visitation of the
      coast of Malabar. The synod of Diamper, at which he presided,
      consummated the pious work of the reunion; and rigorously imposed
      the doctrine and discipline of the Roman church, without
      forgetting auricular confession, the strongest engine of
      ecclesiastical torture. The memory of Theodore and Nestorius was
      condemned, and Malabar was reduced under the dominion of the
      pope, of the primate, and of the Jesuits who invaded the see of
      Angamala or Cranganor. Sixty years of servitude and hypocrisy
      were patiently endured; but as soon as the Portuguese empire was
      shaken by the courage and industry of the Dutch, the Nestorians
      asserted, with vigor and effect, the religion of their fathers.
      The Jesuits were incapable of defending the power which they had
      abused; the arms of forty thousand Christians were pointed
      against their falling tyrants; and the Indian archdeacon assumed
      the character of bishop till a fresh supply of episcopal gifts
      and Syriac missionaries could be obtained from the patriarch of
      Babylon. Since the expulsion of the Portuguese, the Nestorian
      creed is freely professed on the coast of Malabar. The trading
      companies of Holland and England are the friends of toleration;
      but if oppression be less mortifying than contempt, the
      Christians of St. Thomas have reason to complain of the cold and
      silent indifference of their brethren of Europe. 124

      II. The history of the Monophysites is less copious and
      interesting than that of the Nestorians. Under the reigns of Zeno
      and Anastasius, their artful leaders surprised the ear of the
      prince, usurped the thrones of the East, and crushed on its
      native soil the school of the Syrians. The rule of the
      Monophysite faith was defined with exquisite discretion by
      Severus, patriarch of Antioch: he condemned, in the style of the
      Henoticon, the adverse heresies of Nestorius; and Eutyches
      maintained against the latter the reality of the body of Christ,
      and constrained the Greeks to allow that he was a liar who spoke
      truth. 125 But the approximation of ideas could not abate the
      vehemence of passion; each party was the more astonished that
      their blind antagonist could dispute on so trifling a difference;
      the tyrant of Syria enforced the belief of his creed, and his
      reign was polluted with the blood of three hundred and fifty
      monks, who were slain, not perhaps without provocation or
      resistance, under the walls of Apamea. 126 The successor of
      Anastasius replanted the orthodox standard in the East; Severus
      fled into Egypt; and his friend, the eloquent Xenaias, 127 who
      had escaped from the Nestorians of Persia, was suffocated in his
      exile by the Melchites of Paphlagonia. Fifty-four bishops were
      swept from their thrones, eight hundred ecclesiastics were cast
      into prison, 128 and notwithstanding the ambiguous favor of
      Theodora, the Oriental flocks, deprived of their shepherds, must
      insensibly have been either famished or poisoned. In this
      spiritual distress, the expiring faction was revived, and united,
      and perpetuated, by the labors of a monk; and the name of James
      Baradaeus 129 has been preserved in the appellation of Jacobites,
      a familiar sound, which may startle the ear of an English reader.
      From the holy confessors in their prison of Constantinople, he
      received the powers of bishop of Edessa and apostle of the East,
      and the ordination of fourscore thousand bishops, priests, and
      deacons, is derived from the same inexhaustible source. The speed
      of the zealous missionary was promoted by the fleetest
      dromedaries of a devout chief of the Arabs; the doctrine and
      discipline of the Jacobites were secretly established in the
      dominions of Justinian; and each Jacobite was compelled to
      violate the laws and to hate the Roman legislator. The successors
      of Severus, while they lurked in convents or villages, while they
      sheltered their proscribed heads in the caverns of hermits, or
      the tents of the Saracens, still asserted, as they now assert,
      their indefeasible right to the title, the rank, and the
      prerogatives of patriarch of Antioch: under the milder yoke of
      the infidels, they reside about a league from Merdin, in the
      pleasant monastery of Zapharan, which they have embellished with
      cells, aqueducts, and plantations. The secondary, though
      honorable, place is filled by the maphrian, who, in his station
      at Mosul itself, defies the Nestorian catholic with whom he
      contests the primacy of the East. Under the patriarch and the
      maphrian, one hundred and fifty archbishops and bishops have been
      counted in the different ages of the Jacobite church; but the
      order of the hierarchy is relaxed or dissolved, and the greater
      part of their dioceses is confined to the neighborhood of the
      Euphrates and the Tigris. The cities of Aleppo and Amida, which
      are often visited by the patriarch, contain some wealthy
      merchants and industrious mechanics, but the multitude derive
      their scanty sustenance from their daily labor: and poverty, as
      well as superstition, may impose their excessive fasts: five
      annual lents, during which both the clergy and laity abstain not
      only from flesh or eggs, but even from the taste of wine, of oil,
      and of fish. Their present numbers are esteemed from fifty to
      fourscore thousand souls, the remnant of a populous church, which
      was gradually decreased under the impression of twelve centuries.
      Yet in that long period, some strangers of merit have been
      converted to the Monophysite faith, and a Jew was the father of
      Abulpharagius, 130 primate of the East, so truly eminent both in
      his life and death. In his life he was an elegant writer of the
      Syriac and Arabic tongues, a poet, physician, and historian, a
      subtile philosopher, and a moderate divine. In his death, his
      funeral was attended by his rival the Nestorian patriarch, with a
      train of Greeks and Armenians, who forgot their disputes, and
      mingled their tears over the grave of an enemy. The sect which
      was honored by the virtues of Abulpharagius appears, however, to
      sink below the level of their Nestorian brethren. The
      superstition of the Jacobites is more abject, their fasts more
      rigid, 131 their intestine divisions are more numerous, and their
      doctors (as far as I can measure the degrees of nonsense) are
      more remote from the precincts of reason. Something may possibly
      be allowed for the rigor of the Monophysite theology; much more
      for the superior influence of the monastic order. In Syria, in
      Egypt, in Ethiopia, the Jacobite monks have ever been
      distinguished by the austerity of their penance and the absurdity
      of their legends. Alive or dead, they are worshipped as the
      favorites of the Deity; the crosier of bishop and patriarch is
      reserved for their venerable hands; and they assume the
      government of men, while they are yet reeking with the habits and
      prejudices of the cloister. 132

      Catholics and the Maphrians of the Jacobites.]

      III. In the style of the Oriental Christians, the Monothelites of
      every age are described under the appellation of Maronites, 133 a
      name which has been insensibly transferred from a hermit to a
      monastery, from a monastery to a nation. Maron, a saint or savage
      of the fifth century, displayed his religious madness in Syria;
      the rival cities of Apamea and Emesa disputed his relics, a
      stately church was erected on his tomb, and six hundred of his
      disciples united their solitary cells on the banks of the
      Orontes. In the controversies of the incarnation they nicely
      threaded the orthodox line between the sects of Nestorians and
      Eutyches; but the unfortunate question of one will or operation
      in the two natures of Christ, was generated by their curious
      leisure. Their proselyte, the emperor Heraclius, was rejected as
      a Maronite from the walls of Emesa, he found a refuge in the
      monastery of his brethren; and their theological lessons were
      repaid with the gift a spacious and wealthy domain. The name and
      doctrine of this venerable school were propagated among the
      Greeks and Syrians, and their zeal is expressed by Macarius,
      patriarch of Antioch, who declared before the synod of
      Constantinople, that sooner than subscribe the two wills of
      Christ, he would submit to be hewn piecemeal and cast into the
      sea. 134 A similar or a less cruel mode of persecution soon
      converted the unresisting subjects of the plain, while the
      glorious title of Mardaites, 135 or rebels, was bravely
      maintained by the hardy natives of Mount Libanus. John Maron, one
      of the most learned and popular of the monks, assumed the
      character of patriarch of Antioch; his nephew, Abraham, at the
      head of the Maronites, defended their civil and religious freedom
      against the tyrants of the East. The son of the orthodox
      Constantine pursued with pious hatred a people of soldiers, who
      might have stood the bulwark of his empire against the common
      foes of Christ and of Rome. An army of Greeks invaded Syria; the
      monastery of St. Maron was destroyed with fire; the bravest
      chieftains were betrayed and murdered, and twelve thousand of
      their followers were transplanted to the distant frontiers of
      Armenia and Thrace. Yet the humble nation of the Maronites had
      survived the empire of Constantinople, and they still enjoy,
      under their Turkish masters, a free religion and a mitigated
      servitude. Their domestic governors are chosen among the ancient
      nobility: the patriarch, in his monastery of Canobin, still
      fancies himself on the throne of Antioch: nine bishops compose
      his synod, and one hundred and fifty priests, who retain the
      liberty of marriage, are intrusted with the care of one hundred
      thousand souls. Their country extends from the ridge of Mount
      Libanus to the shores of Tripoli; and the gradual descent
      affords, in a narrow space, each variety of soil and climate,
      from the Holy Cedars, erect under the weight of snow, 136 to the
      vine, the mulberry, and the olive-trees of the fruitful valley.
      In the twelfth century, the Maronites, abjuring the Monothelite
      error were reconciled to the Latin churches of Antioch and Rome,
      137 and the same alliance has been frequently renewed by the
      ambition of the popes and the distress of the Syrians. But it may
      reasonably be questioned, whether their union has ever been
      perfect or sincere; and the learned Maronites of the college of
      Rome have vainly labored to absolve their ancestors from the
      guilt of heresy and schism. 138

      IV. Since the age of Constantine, the Armenians 139 had
      signalized their attachment to the religion and empire of the
      Christians. 1391 The disorders of their country, and their
      ignorance of the Greek tongue, prevented their clergy from
      assisting at the synod of Chalcedon, and they floated eighty-four
      years 140 in a state of indifference or suspense, till their
      vacant faith was finally occupied by the missionaries of Julian
      of Halicarnassus, 141 who in Egypt, their common exile, had been
      vanquished by the arguments or the influence of his rival
      Severus, the Monophysite patriarch of Antioch. The Armenians
      alone are the pure disciples of Eutyches, an unfortunate parent,
      who has been renounced by the greater part of his spiritual
      progeny. They alone persevere in the opinion, that the manhood of
      Christ was created, or existed without creation, of a divine and
      incorruptible substance. Their adversaries reproach them with the
      adoration of a phantom; and they retort the accusation, by
      deriding or execrating the blasphemy of the Jacobites, who impute
      to the Godhead the vile infirmities of the flesh, even the
      natural effects of nutrition and digestion. The religion of
      Armenia could not derive much glory from the learning or the
      power of its inhabitants. The royalty expired with the origin of
      their schism; and their Christian kings, who arose and fell in
      the thirteenth century on the confines of Cilicia, were the
      clients of the Latins and the vassals of the Turkish sultan of
      Iconium. The helpless nation has seldom been permitted to enjoy
      the tranquillity of servitude. From the earliest period to the
      present hour, Armenia has been the theatre of perpetual war: the
      lands between Tauris and Erivan were dispeopled by the cruel
      policy of the Sophis; and myriads of Christian families were
      transplanted, to perish or to propagate in the distant provinces
      of Persia. Under the rod of oppression, the zeal of the Armenians
      is fervent and intrepid; they have often preferred the crown of
      martyrdom to the white turban of Mahomet; they devoutly hate the
      error and idolatry of the Greeks; and their transient union with
      the Latins is not less devoid of truth, than the thousand
      bishops, whom their patriarch offered at the feet of the Roman
      pontiff. 142 The catholic, or patriarch, of the Armenians resides
      in the monastery of Ekmiasin, three leagues from Erivan.
      Forty-seven archbishops, each of whom may claim the obedience of
      four or five suffragans, are consecrated by his hand; but the far
      greater part are only titular prelates, who dignify with their
      presence and service the simplicity of his court. As soon as they
      have performed the liturgy, they cultivate the garden; and our
      bishops will hear with surprise, that the austerity of their life
      increases in just proportion to the elevation of their rank.

      In the fourscore thousand towns or villages of his spiritual
      empire, the patriarch receives a small and voluntary tax from
      each person above the age of fifteen; but the annual amount of
      six hundred thousand crowns is insufficient to supply the
      incessant demands of charity and tribute. Since the beginning of
      the last century, the Armenians have obtained a large and
      lucrative share of the commerce of the East: in their return from
      Europe, the caravan usually halts in the neighborhood of Erivan,
      the altars are enriched with the fruits of their patient
      industry; and the faith of Eutyches is preached in their recent
      congregations of Barbary and Poland. 143

      V. In the rest of the Roman empire, the despotism of the prince
      might eradicate or silence the sectaries of an obnoxious creed.
      But the stubborn temper of the Egyptians maintained their
      opposition to the synod of Chalcedon, and the policy of Justinian
      condescended to expect and to seize the opportunity of discord.
      The Monophysite church of Alexandria 144 was torn by the disputes
      of the corruptibles and incorruptibles, and on the death of the
      patriarch, the two factions upheld their respective candidates.
      145 Gaian was the disciple of Julian, Theodosius had been the
      pupil of Severus: the claims of the former were supported by the
      consent of the monks and senators, the city and the province; the
      latter depended on the priority of his ordination, the favor of
      the empress Theodora, and the arms of the eunuch Narses, which
      might have been used in more honorable warfare. The exile of the
      popular candidate to Carthage and Sardinia inflamed the ferment
      of Alexandria; and after a schism of one hundred and seventy
      years, the Gaianites still revered the memory and doctrine of
      their founder. The strength of numbers and of discipline was
      tried in a desperate and bloody conflict; the streets were filled
      with the dead bodies of citizens and soldiers; the pious women,
      ascending the roofs of their houses, showered down every sharp or
      ponderous utensil on the heads of the enemy; and the final
      victory of Narses was owing to the flames, with which he wasted
      the third capital of the Roman world. But the lieutenant of
      Justinian had not conquered in the cause of a heretic; Theodosius
      himself was speedily, though gently, removed; and Paul of Tanis,
      an orthodox monk, was raised to the throne of Athanasius. The
      powers of government were strained in his support; he might
      appoint or displace the dukes and tribunes of Egypt; the
      allowance of bread, which Diocletian had granted, was suppressed,
      the churches were shut, and a nation of schismatics was deprived
      at once of their spiritual and carnal food. In his turn, the
      tyrant was excommunicated by the zeal and revenge of the people:
      and none except his servile Melchites would salute him as a man,
      a Christian, or a bishop. Yet such is the blindness of ambition,
      that, when Paul was expelled on a charge of murder, he solicited,
      with a bribe of seven hundred pounds of gold, his restoration to
      the same station of hatred and ignominy. His successor
      Apollinaris entered the hostile city in military array, alike
      qualified for prayer or for battle. His troops, under arms, were
      distributed through the streets; the gates of the cathedral were
      guarded, and a chosen band was stationed in the choir, to defend
      the person of their chief. He stood erect on his throne, and,
      throwing aside the upper garment of a warrior, suddenly appeared
      before the eyes of the multitude in the robes of patriarch of
      Alexandria. Astonishment held them mute; but no sooner had
      Apollinaris begun to read the tome of St. Leo, than a volley of
      curses, and invectives, and stones, assaulted the odious minister
      of the emperor and the synod. A charge was instantly sounded by
      the successor of the apostles; the soldiers waded to their knees
      in blood; and two hundred thousand Christians are said to have
      fallen by the sword: an incredible account, even if it be
      extended from the slaughter of a day to the eighteen years of the
      reign of Apollinaris. Two succeeding patriarchs, Eulogius 146 and
      John, 147 labored in the conversion of heretics, with arms and
      arguments more worthy of their evangelical profession. The
      theological knowledge of Eulogius was displayed in many a volume,
      which magnified the errors of Eutyches and Severus, and attempted
      to reconcile the ambiguous language of St. Cyril with the
      orthodox creed of Pope Leo and the fathers of Chalcedon. The
      bounteous alms of John the eleemosynary were dictated by
      superstition, or benevolence, or policy. Seven thousand five
      hundred poor were maintained at his expense; on his accession he
      found eight thousand pounds of gold in the treasury of the
      church; he collected ten thousand from the liberality of the
      faithful; yet the primate could boast in his testament, that he
      left behind him no more than the third part of the smallest of
      the silver coins. The churches of Alexandria were delivered to
      the Catholics, the religion of the Monophysites was proscribed in
      Egypt, and a law was revived which excluded the natives from the
      honors and emoluments of the state.

      Chapter XLVII: Ecclesiastical Discord.—Part VI.

      A more important conquest still remained, of the patriarch, the
      oracle and leader of the Egyptian church. Theodosius had resisted
      the threats and promises of Justinian with the spirit of an
      apostle or an enthusiast. “Such,” replied the patriarch, “were
      the offers of the tempter when he showed the kingdoms of the
      earth. But my soul is far dearer to me than life or dominion. The
      churches are in the hands of a prince who can kill the body; but
      my conscience is my own; and in exile, poverty, or chains, I will
      steadfastly adhere to the faith of my holy predecessors,
      Athanasius, Cyril, and Dioscorus. Anathema to the tome of Leo and
      the synod of Chalcedon! Anathema to all who embrace their creed!
      Anathema to them now and forevermore! Naked came I out of my
      mother’s womb, naked shall I descend into the grave. Let those
      who love God follow me and seek their salvation.” After
      comforting his brethren, he embarked for Constantinople, and
      sustained, in six successive interviews, the almost irresistible
      weight of the royal presence. His opinions were favorably
      entertained in the palace and the city; the influence of Theodora
      assured him a safe conduct and honorable dismission; and he ended
      his days, though not on the throne, yet in the bosom, of his
      native country. On the news of his death, Apollinaris indecently
      feasted the nobles and the clergy; but his joy was checked by the
      intelligence of a new election; and while he enjoyed the wealth
      of Alexandria, his rivals reigned in the monasteries of Thebais,
      and were maintained by the voluntary oblations of the people. A
      perpetual succession of patriarchs arose from the ashes of
      Theodosius; and the Monophysite churches of Syria and Egypt were
      united by the name of Jacobites and the communion of the faith.
      But the same faith, which has been confined to a narrow sect of
      the Syrians, was diffused over the mass of the Egyptian or Coptic
      nation; who, almost unanimously, rejected the decrees of the
      synod of Chalcedon. A thousand years were now elapsed since Egypt
      had ceased to be a kingdom, since the conquerors of Asia and
      Europe had trampled on the ready necks of a people, whose ancient
      wisdom and power ascend beyond the records of history. The
      conflict of zeal and persecution rekindled some sparks of their
      national spirit. They abjured, with a foreign heresy, the manners
      and language of the Greeks: every Melchite, in their eyes, was a
      stranger, every Jacobite a citizen; the alliance of marriage, the
      offices of humanity, were condemned as a deadly sin; the natives
      renounced all allegiance to the emperor; and his orders, at a
      distance from Alexandria, were obeyed only under the pressure of
      military force. A generous effort might have edeemed the religion
      and liberty of Egypt, and her six hundred monasteries might have
      poured forth their myriads of holy warriors, for whom death
      should have no terrors, since life had no comfort or delight. But
      experience has proved the distinction of active and passive
      courage; the fanatic who endures without a groan the torture of
      the rack or the stake, would tremble and fly before the face of
      an armed enemy. The pusillanimous temper of the Egyptians could
      only hope for a change of masters; the arms of Chosroes
      depopulated the land, yet under his reign the Jacobites enjoyed a
      short and precarious respite. The victory of Heraclius renewed
      and aggravated the persecution, and the patriarch again escaped
      from Alexandria to the desert. In his flight, Benjamin was
      encouraged by a voice, which bade him expect, at the end of ten
      years, the aid of a foreign nation, marked, like the Egyptians
      themselves, with the ancient rite of circumcision. The character
      of these deliverers, and the nature of the deliverance, will be
      hereafter explained; and I shall step over the interval of eleven
      centuries to observe the present misery of the Jacobites of
      Egypt. The populous city of Cairo affords a residence, or rather
      a shelter, for their indigent patriarch, and a remnant of ten
      bishops; forty monasteries have survived the inroads of the
      Arabs; and the progress of servitude and apostasy has reduced the
      Coptic nation to the despicable number of twenty-five or thirty
      thousand families; 148 a race of illiterate beggars, whose only
      consolation is derived from the superior wretchedness of the
      Greek patriarch and his diminutive congregation. 149

      numerous than his orthodox Greeks, ingeniously applying Homer,

      VI. The Coptic patriarch, a rebel to the Caesars, or a slave to
      the khalifs, still gloried in the filial obedience of the kings
      of Nubia and Aethiopia. He repaid their homage by magnifying
      their greatness; and it was boldly asserted that they could bring
      into the field a hundred thousand horse, with an equal number of
      camels; 150 that their hand could pour out or restrain the waters
      of the Nile; 151 and the peace and plenty of Egypt was obtained,
      even in this world, by the intercession of the patriarch. In
      exile at Constantinople, Theodosius recommended to his patroness
      the conversion of the black nations of Nubia, from the tropic of
      Cancer to the confines of Abyssinia. 152 Her design was suspected
      and emulated by the more orthodox emperor. The rival
      missionaries, a Melchite and a Jacobite, embarked at the same
      time; but the empress, from a motive of love or fear, was more
      effectually obeyed; and the Catholic priest was detained by the
      president of Thebais, while the king of Nubia and his court were
      hastily baptized in the faith of Dioscorus. The tardy envoy of
      Justinian was received and dismissed with honor: but when he
      accused the heresy and treason of the Egyptians, the negro
      convert was instructed to reply that he would never abandon his
      brethren, the true believers, to the persecuting ministers of the
      synod of Chalcedon. 153 During several ages, the bishops of Nubia
      were named and consecrated by the Jacobite patriarch of
      Alexandria: as late as the twelfth century, Christianity
      prevailed; and some rites, some ruins, are still visible in the
      savage towns of Sennaar and Dongola. 154 But the Nubians at
      length executed their threats of returning to the worship of
      idols; the climate required the indulgence of polygamy, and they
      have finally preferred the triumph of the Koran to the abasement
      of the Cross. A metaphysical religion may appear too refined for
      the capacity of the negro race: yet a black or a parrot might be
      taught to repeat the words of the Chalcedonian or Monophysite
      creed.

      Lettres Edifiantes (Recueil, iv.) and Busching, (tom. ix. p.

      Christianity was more deeply rooted in the Abyssinian empire;
      and, although the correspondence has been sometimes interrupted
      above seventy or a hundred years, the mother-church of Alexandria
      retains her colony in a state of perpetual pupilage. Seven
      bishops once composed the Aethiopic synod: had their number
      amounted to ten, they might have elected an independent primate;
      and one of their kings was ambitious of promoting his brother to
      the ecclesiastical throne. But the event was foreseen, the
      increase was denied: the episcopal office has been gradually
      confined to the abuna, 155 the head and author of the Abyssinian
      priesthood; the patriarch supplies each vacancy with an Egyptian
      monk; and the character of a stranger appears more venerable in
      the eyes of the people, less dangerous in those of the monarch.
      In the sixth century, when the schism of Egypt was confirmed, the
      rival chiefs, with their patrons, Justinian and Theodora, strove
      to outstrip each other in the conquest of a remote and
      independent province. The industry of the empress was again
      victorious, and the pious Theodora has established in that
      sequestered church the faith and discipline of the Jacobites. 156
      Encompassed on all sides by the enemies of their religion, the
      Aethiopians slept near a thousand years, forgetful of the world,
      by whom they were forgotten. They were awakened by the
      Portuguese, who, turning the southern promontory of Africa,
      appeared in India and the Red Sea, as if they had descended
      through the air from a distant planet. In the first moments of
      their interview, the subjects of Rome and Alexandria observed the
      resemblance, rather than the difference, of their faith; and each
      nation expected the most important benefits from an alliance with
      their Christian brethren. In their lonely situation, the
      Aethiopians had almost relapsed into the savage life. Their
      vessels, which had traded to Ceylon, scarcely presumed to
      navigate the rivers of Africa; the ruins of Axume were deserted,
      the nation was scattered in villages, and the emperor, a pompous
      name, was content, both in peace and war, with the immovable
      residence of a camp. Conscious of their own indigence, the
      Abyssinians had formed the rational project of importing the arts
      and ingenuity of Europe; 157 and their ambassadors at Rome and
      Lisbon were instructed to solicit a colony of smiths, carpenters,
      tilers, masons, printers, surgeons, and physicians, for the use
      of their country. But the public danger soon called for the
      instant and effectual aid of arms and soldiers, to defend an
      unwarlike people from the Barbarians who ravaged the inland
      country and the Turks and Arabs who advanced from the sea-coast
      in more formidable array. Aethiopia was saved by four hundred and
      fifty Portuguese, who displayed in the field the native valor of
      Europeans, and the artificial power of the musket and cannon. In
      a moment of terror, the emperor had promised to reconcile himself
      and his subjects to the Catholic faith; a Latin patriarch
      represented the supremacy of the pope: 158 the empire, enlarged
      in a tenfold proportion, was supposed to contain more gold than
      the mines of America; and the wildest hopes of avarice and zeal
      were built on the willing submission of the Christians of Africa.

      155 (return) [ The abuna is improperly dignified by the Latins
      with the title of patriarch. The Abyssinians acknowledge only the

      (Christianisme d’Ethiopie, p. 92—265.) The piece is curious; but
      the author may be suspected of deceiving Abyssinia, Rome, and
      Portugal. His title to the rank of patriarch is dark and
      doubtful, (Ludolph. Comment. No. 101, p. 473.)]

      But the vows which pain had extorted were forsworn on the return
      of health. The Abyssinians still adhered with unshaken constancy
      to the Monophysite faith; their languid belief was inflamed by
      the exercise of dispute; they branded the Latins with the names
      of Arians and Nestorians, and imputed the adoration of four gods
      to those who separated the two natures of Christ. Fremona, a
      place of worship, or rather of exile, was assigned to the Jesuit
      missionaries. Their skill in the liberal and mechanic arts, their
      theological learning, and the decency of their manners, inspired
      a barren esteem; but they were not endowed with the gift of
      miracles, 159 and they vainly solicited a reenforcement of
      European troops. The patience and dexterity of forty years at
      length obtained a more favorable audience, and two emperors of
      Abyssinia were persuaded that Rome could insure the temporal and
      everlasting happiness of her votaries. The first of these royal
      converts lost his crown and his life; and the rebel army was
      sanctified by the abuna, who hurled an anathema at the apostate,
      and absolved his subjects from their oath of fidelity. The fate
      of Zadenghel was revenged by the courage and fortune of Susneus,
      who ascended the throne under the name of Segued, and more
      vigorously prosecuted the pious enterprise of his kinsman. After
      the amusement of some unequal combats between the Jesuits and his
      illiterate priests, the emperor declared himself a proselyte to
      the synod of Chalcedon, presuming that his clergy and people
      would embrace without delay the religion of their prince. The
      liberty of choice was succeeded by a law, which imposed, under
      pain of death, the belief of the two natures of Christ: the
      Abyssinians were enjoined to work and to play on the Sabbath; and
      Segued, in the face of Europe and Africa, renounced his
      connection with the Alexandrian church. A Jesuit, Alphonso
      Mendez, the Catholic patriarch of Aethiopia, accepted, in the
      name of Urban VIII., the homage and abjuration of the penitent.
      “I confess,” said the emperor on his knees, “I confess that the
      pope is the vicar of Christ, the successor of St. Peter, and the
      sovereign of the world. To him I swear true obedience, and at his
      feet I offer my person and kingdom.” A similar oath was repeated
      by his son, his brother, the clergy, the nobles, and even the
      ladies of the court: the Latin patriarch was invested with honors
      and wealth; and his missionaries erected their churches or
      citadels in the most convenient stations of the empire. The
      Jesuits themselves deplore the fatal indiscretion of their chief,
      who forgot the mildness of the gospel and the policy of his
      order, to introduce with hasty violence the liturgy of Rome and
      the inquisition of Portugal. He condemned the ancient practice of
      circumcision, which health, rather than superstition, had first
      invented in the climate of Aethiopia. 160 A new baptism, a new
      ordination, was inflicted on the natives; and they trembled with
      horror when the most holy of the dead were torn from their
      graves, when the most illustrious of the living were
      excommunicated by a foreign priest. In the defense of their
      religion and liberty, the Abyssinians rose in arms, with
      desperate but unsuccessful zeal. Five rebellions were
      extinguished in the blood of the insurgents: two abunas were
      slain in battle, whole legions were slaughtered in the field, or
      suffocated in their caverns; and neither merit, nor rank, nor
      sex, could save from an ignominious death the enemies of Rome.
      But the victorious monarch was finally subdued by the constancy
      of the nation, of his mother, of his son, and of his most
      faithful friends. Segued listened to the voice of pity, of
      reason, perhaps of fear: and his edict of liberty of conscience
      instantly revealed the tyranny and weakness of the Jesuits. On
      the death of his father, Basilides expelled the Latin patriarch,
      and restored to the wishes of the nation the faith and the
      discipline of Egypt. The Monophysite churches resounded with a
      song of triumph, “that the sheep of Aethiopia were now delivered
      from the hyaenas of the West;” and the gates of that solitary
      realm were forever shut against the arts, the science, and the
      fanaticism of Europe. 161

      Comment. No. 126, p. 529;) and such assurances should be
      preciously kept, as an antidote against any marvellous legends.]

      160 (return) [ I am aware how tender is the question of
      circumcision. Yet I will affirm, 1. That the Aethiopians have a
      physical reason for the circumcision of males, and even of
      females, (Recherches Philosophiques sur les Americains, tom. ii.)
      2. That it was practised in Aethiopia long before the
      introduction of Judaism or Christianity, (Herodot. l. ii. c. 104.
      Marsham, Canon. Chron. p. 72, 73.) “Infantes circumcidunt ob
      consuetudinemn, non ob Judaismum,” says Gregory the Abyssinian
      priest, (apud Fabric. Lux Christiana, p. 720.) Yet in the heat of
      dispute, the Portuguese were sometimes branded with the name of
      uncircumcised, (La Croze, p. 90. Ludolph. Hist. and Comment. l.
      iii. c. l.)]

      161 (return) [ The three Protestant historians, Ludolphus, (Hist.
      Aethiopica, Francofurt. 1681; Commentarius, 1691; Relatio Nova,
      &c., 1693, in folio,) Geddes, (Church History of Aethiopia,
      London, 1696, in 8vo..) and La Croze, (Hist. du Christianisme
      d’Ethiopie et d’Armenie, La Haye, 1739, in 12mo.,) have drawn
      their principal materials from the Jesuits, especially from the
      General History of Tellez, published in Portuguese at Coimbra,
      1660. We might be surprised at their frankness; but their most
      flagitious vice, the spirit of persecution, was in their eyes the
      most meritorious virtue. Ludolphus possessed some, though a
      slight, advantage from the Aethiopic language, and the personal
      conversation of Gregory, a free-spirited Abyssinian priest, whom
      he invited from Rome to the court of Saxe-Gotha. See the
      Theologia Aethiopica of Gregory, in (Fabric. Lux Evangelii, p.
      716—734.) * Note: The travels of Bruce, illustrated by those of
      Mr. Salt, and the narrative of Nathaniel Pearce, have brought us
      again acquainted with this remote region. Whatever may be their
      speculative opinions the barbarous manners of the Ethiopians seem
      to be gaining more and more the ascendency over the practice of
      Christianity.—M.]
