      In the first ages of the decline and fall of the Roman empire,
      our eye is invariably fixed on the royal city, which had given
      laws to the fairest portion of the globe. We contemplate her
      fortunes, at first with admiration, at length with pity, always
      with attention, and when that attention is diverted from the
      capital to the provinces, they are considered as so many branches
      which have been successively severed from the Imperial trunk. The
      foundation of a second Rome, on the shores of the Bosphorus, has
      compelled the historian to follow the successors of Constantine;
      and our curiosity has been tempted to visit the most remote
      countries of Europe and Asia, to explore the causes and the
      authors of the long decay of the Byzantine monarchy. By the
      conquest of Justinian, we have been recalled to the banks of the
      Tyber, to the deliverance of the ancient metropolis; but that
      deliverance was a change, or perhaps an aggravation, of
      servitude. Rome had been already stripped of her trophies, her
      gods, and her Cæsars; nor was the Gothic dominion more inglorious
      and oppressive than the tyranny of the Greeks. In the eighth
      century of the Christian æra, a religious quarrel, the worship of
      images, provoked the Romans to assert their independence: their
      bishop became the temporal, as well as the spiritual, father of a
      free people; and of the Western empire, which was restored by
      Charlemagne, the title and image still decorate the singular
      constitution of modern Germany. The name of Rome must yet command
      our involuntary respect: the climate (whatsoever may be its
      influence) was no longer the same: 1 the purity of blood had been
      contaminated through a thousand channels; but the venerable
      aspect of her ruins, and the memory of past greatness, rekindled
      a spark of the national character. The darkness of the middle
      ages exhibits some scenes not unworthy of our notice. Nor shall I
      dismiss the present work till I have reviewed the state and
      revolutions of the Roman City, which acquiesced under the
      absolute dominion of the popes, about the same time that
      Constantinople was enslaved by the Turkish arms.

      1 (return) [ The abbé Dubos, who, with less genius than his
      successor Montesquieu, has asserted and magnified the influence
      of climate, objects to himself the degeneracy of the Romans and
      Batavians. To the first of these examples he replies, 1. That the
      change is less real than apparent, and that the modern Romans
      prudently conceal in themselves the virtues of their ancestors.
      2. That the air, the soil, and the climate of Rome have suffered
      a great and visible alteration, (Réflexions sur la Poësie et sur
      la Peinture, part ii. sect. 16.) * Note: This question is
      discussed at considerable length in Dr. Arnold’s History of Rome,
      ch. xxiii. See likewise Bunsen’s Dissertation on the Aria Cattiva
      Roms Beschreibung, pp. 82, 108.—M.]

      In the beginning of the twelfth century, 2 the æra of the first
      crusade, Rome was revered by the Latins, as the metropolis of the
      world, as the throne of the pope and the emperor, who, from the
      eternal city, derived their title, their honors, and the right or
      exercise of temporal dominion. After so long an interruption, it
      may not be useless to repeat that the successors of Charlemagne
      and the Othos were chosen beyond the Rhine in a national diet;
      but that these princes were content with the humble names of
      kings of Germany and Italy, till they had passed the Alps and the
      Apennine, to seek their Imperial crown on the banks of the Tyber.
      3 At some distance from the city, their approach was saluted by a
      long procession of the clergy and people with palms and crosses;
      and the terrific emblems of wolves and lions, of dragons and
      eagles, that floated in the military banners, represented the
      departed legions and cohorts of the republic. The royal path to
      maintain the liberties of Rome was thrice reiterated, at the
      bridge, the gate, and on the stairs of the Vatican; and the
      distribution of a customary donative feebly imitated the
      magnificence of the first Cæsars. In the church of St. Peter, the
      coronation was performed by his successor: the voice of God was
      confounded with that of the people; and the public consent was
      declared in the acclamations of “Long life and victory to our
      lord the pope! long life and victory to our lord the emperor!
      long life and victory to the Roman and Teutonic armies!” 4 The
      names of Cæsar and Augustus, the laws of Constantine and
      Justinian, the example of Charlemagne and Otho, established the
      supreme dominion of the emperors: their title and image was
      engraved on the papal coins; 5 and their jurisdiction was marked
      by the sword of justice, which they delivered to the præfect of
      the city. But every Roman prejudice was awakened by the name, the
      language, and the manners, of a Barbarian lord. The Cæsars of
      Saxony or Franconia were the chiefs of a feudal aristocracy; nor
      could they exercise the discipline of civil and military power,
      which alone secures the obedience of a distant people, impatient
      of servitude, though perhaps incapable of freedom. Once, and once
      only, in his life, each emperor, with an army of Teutonic
      vassals, descended from the Alps. I have described the peaceful
      order of his entry and coronation; but that order was commonly
      disturbed by the clamor and sedition of the Romans, who
      encountered their sovereign as a foreign invader: his departure
      was always speedy, and often shameful; and, in the absence of a
      long reign, his authority was insulted, and his name was
      forgotten. The progress of independence in Germany and Italy
      undermined the foundations of the Imperial sovereignty, and the
      triumph of the popes was the deliverance of Rome.

      would advise him to recollect or review the xlixth chapter of
      this History.]

      3 (return) [ The coronation of the German emperors at Rome, more
      especially in the xith century, is best represented from the
      original monuments by Muratori (Antiquitat. Italiæ Medii Ævi,
      tom. i. dissertat. ii. p. 99, &c.) and Cenni, (Monument. Domin.
      Pontif. tom. ii. diss. vi. p. 261,) the latter of whom I only
      know from the copious extract of Schmidt, (Hist. des Allemands
      tom. iii. p. 255—266.)]

      4 (return) [ Exercitui Romano et Teutonico! The latter was both
      seen and felt; but the former was no more than magni nominis
      umbra.]

      5 (return) [ Muratori has given the series of the papal coins,
      (Antiquitat. tom. ii. diss. xxvii. p. 548—554.) He finds only two
      more early than the year 800: fifty are still extant from Leo
      III. to Leo IX., with the addition of the reigning emperor none
      remain of Gregory VII. or Urban II.; but in those of Paschal II.
      he seems to have renounced this badge of dependence.]

      Of her two sovereigns, the emperor had precariously reigned by
      the right of conquest; but the authority of the pope was founded
      on the soft, though more solid, basis of opinion and habit. The
      removal of a foreign influence restored and endeared the shepherd
      to his flock. Instead of the arbitrary or venal nomination of a
      German court, the vicar of Christ was freely chosen by the
      college of cardinals, most of whom were either natives or
      inhabitants of the city. The applause of the magistrates and
      people confirmed his election, and the ecclesiastical power that
      was obeyed in Sweden and Britain had been ultimately derived from
      the suffrage of the Romans. The same suffrage gave a prince, as
      well as a pontiff, to the capital. It was universally believed,
      that Constantine had invested the popes with the temporal
      dominion of Rome; and the boldest civilians, the most profane
      skeptics, were satisfied with disputing the right of the emperor
      and the validity of his gift. The truth of the fact, the
      authenticity of his donation, was deeply rooted in the ignorance
      and tradition of four centuries; and the fabulous origin was lost
      in the real and permanent effects. The name of _Dominus_ or Lord
      was inscribed on the coin of the bishops: their title was
      acknowledged by acclamations and oaths of allegiance, and with
      the free, or reluctant, consent of the German Cæsars, they had
      long exercised a supreme or subordinate jurisdiction over the
      city and patrimony of St. Peter. The reign of the popes, which
      gratified the prejudices, was not incompatible with the
      liberties, of Rome; and a more critical inquiry would have
      revealed a still nobler source of their power; the gratitude of a
      nation, whom they had rescued from the heresy and oppression of
      the Greek tyrant. In an age of superstition, it should seem that
      the union of the royal and sacerdotal characters would mutually
      fortify each other; and that the keys of Paradise would be the
      surest pledge of earthly obedience. The sanctity of the office
      might indeed be degraded by the personal vices of the man. But
      the scandals of the tenth century were obliterated by the austere
      and more dangerous virtues of Gregory the Seventh and his
      successors; and in the ambitious contests which they maintained
      for the rights of the church, their sufferings or their success
      must equally tend to increase the popular veneration. They
      sometimes wandered in poverty and exile, the victims of
      persecution; and the apostolic zeal with which they offered
      themselves to martyrdom must engage the favor and sympathy of
      every Catholic breast. And sometimes, thundering from the
      Vatican, they created, judged, and deposed the kings of the
      world; nor could the proudest Roman be disgraced by submitting to
      a priest, whose feet were kissed, and whose stirrup was held, by
      the successors of Charlemagne. 6 Even the temporal interest of
      the city should have protected in peace and honor the residence
      of the popes; from whence a vain and lazy people derived the
      greatest part of their subsistence and riches. The fixed revenue
      of the popes was probably impaired; many of the old patrimonial
      estates, both in Italy and the provinces, had been invaded by
      sacrilegious hands; nor could the loss be compensated by the
      claim, rather than the possession, of the more ample gifts of
      Pepin and his descendants. But the Vatican and Capitol were
      nourished by the incessant and increasing swarms of pilgrims and
      suppliants: the pale of Christianity was enlarged, and the pope
      and cardinals were overwhelmed by the judgment of ecclesiastical
      and secular causes. A new jurisprudence had established in the
      Latin church the right and practice of appeals; 7 and from the
      North and West the bishops and abbots were invited or summoned to
      solicit, to complain, to accuse, or to justify, before the
      threshold of the apostles. A rare prodigy is once recorded, that
      two horses, belonging to the archbishops of Mentz and Cologne,
      repassed the Alps, yet laden with gold and silver: 8 but it was
      soon understood, that the success, both of the pilgrims and
      clients, depended much less on the justice of their cause than on
      the value of their offering. The wealth and piety of these
      strangers were ostentatiously displayed; and their expenses,
      sacred or profane, circulated in various channels for the
      emolument of the Romans.

      6 (return) [ See Ducange, Gloss. mediæ et infimæ Latinitat. tom.
      vi. p. 364, 365, Staffa. This homage was paid by kings to
      archbishops, and by vassals to their lords, (Schmidt, tom. iii.
      p. 262;) and it was the nicest policy of Rome to confound the
      marks of filial and of feudal subjection.]

      7 (return) [ The appeals from all the churches to the Roman
      pontiff are deplored by the zeal of St. Bernard (de
      Consideratione, l. iii. tom. ii. p. 431—442, edit. Mabillon,
      Venet. 1750) and the judgment of Fleury, (Discours sur l’Hist.
      Ecclésiastique, iv. et vii.) But the saint, who believed in the
      false decretals condemns only the abuse of these appeals; the
      more enlightened historian investigates the origin, and rejects
      the principles, of this new jurisprudence.]

      8 (return) [ Germanici.... summarii non levatis sarcinis onusti
      nihilominus repatriant inviti. Nova res! quando hactenus aurum
      Roma refudit? Et nunc Romanorum consilio id usurpatum non
      credimus, (Bernard, de Consideratione, l. iii. c. 3, p. 437.) The
      first words of the passage are obscure, and probably corrupt.]

      Such powerful motives should have firmly attached the voluntary
      and pious obedience of the Roman people to their spiritual and
      temporal father. But the operation of prejudice and interest is
      often disturbed by the sallies of ungovernable passion. The
      Indian who fells the tree, that he may gather the fruit, 9 and
      the Arab who plunders the caravans of commerce, are actuated by
      the same impulse of savage nature, which overlooks the future in
      the present, and relinquishes for momentary rapine the long and
      secure possession of the most important blessings. And it was
      thus, that the shrine of St. Peter was profaned by the
      thoughtless Romans; who pillaged the offerings, and wounded the
      pilgrims, without computing the number and value of similar
      visits, which they prevented by their inhospitable sacrilege.
      Even the influence of superstition is fluctuating and precarious;
      and the slave, whose reason is subdued, will often be delivered
      by his avarice or pride. A credulous devotion for the fables and
      oracles of the priesthood most powerfully acts on the mind of a
      Barbarian; yet such a mind is the least capable of preferring
      imagination to sense, of sacrificing to a distant motive, to an
      invisible, perhaps an ideal, object, the appetites and interests
      of the present world. In the vigor of health and youth, his
      practice will perpetually contradict his belief; till the
      pressure of age, or sickness, or calamity, awakens his terrors,
      and compels him to satisfy the double debt of piety and remorse.
      I have already observed, that the modern times of religious
      indifference are the most favorable to the peace and security of
      the clergy. Under the reign of superstition, they had much to
      hope from the ignorance, and much to fear from the violence, of
      mankind. The wealth, whose constant increase must have rendered
      them the sole proprietors of the earth, was alternately bestowed
      by the repentant father and plundered by the rapacious son: their
      persons were adored or violated; and the same idol, by the hands
      of the same votaries, was placed on the altar, or trampled in the
      dust. In the feudal system of Europe, arms were the title of
      distinction and the measure of allegiance; and amidst their
      tumult, the still voice of law and reason was seldom heard or
      obeyed. The turbulent Romans disdained the yoke, and insulted the
      impotence, of their bishop: 10 nor would his education or
      character allow him to exercise, with decency or effect, the
      power of the sword. The motives of his election and the frailties
      of his life were exposed to their familiar observation; and
      proximity must diminish the reverence which his name and his
      decrees impressed on a barbarous world. This difference has not
      escaped the notice of our philosophic historian: “Though the name
      and authority of the court of Rome were so terrible in the remote
      countries of Europe, which were sunk in profound ignorance, and
      were entirely unacquainted with its character and conduct, the
      pope was so little revered at home, that his inveterate enemies
      surrounded the gates of Rome itself, and even controlled his
      government in that city; and the ambassadors, who, from a distant
      extremity of Europe, carried to him the humble, or rather abject,
      submissions of the greatest potentate of the age, found the
      utmost difficulty to make their way to him, and to throw
      themselves at his feet.” 11

      passion and ignorance are always despotic.]

      10 (return) [ In a free conversation with his countryman Adrian
      IV., John of Salisbury accuses the avarice of the pope and
      clergy: Provinciarum diripiunt spolia, ac si thesauros Crsi

      blames the rashness and infidelity of the Romans, whom their
      bishops vainly strove to conciliate by gifts, instead of virtues.
      It is pity that this miscellaneous writer has not given us less
      morality and erudition, and more pictures of himself and the
      times.]

      writer has given us, from Fitz-Stephen, a singular act of cruelty
      perpetrated on the clergy by Geoffrey, the father of Henry II.
      “When he was master of Normandy, the chapter of Seez presumed,
      without his consent, to proceed to the election of a bishop: upon
      which he ordered all of them, with the bishop elect, to be
      castrated, and made all their testicles be brought him in a
      platter.” Of the pain and danger they might justly complain; yet
      since they had vowed chastity he deprived them of a superfluous
      treasure.]

      Since the primitive times, the wealth of the popes was exposed to
      envy, their powers to opposition, and their persons to violence.
      But the long hostility of the mitre and the crown increased the
      numbers, and inflamed the passions, of their enemies. The deadly
      factions of the Guelphs and Ghibelines, so fatal to Italy, could
      never be embraced with truth or constancy by the Romans, the
      subjects and adversaries both of the bishop and emperor; but
      their support was solicited by both parties, and they alternately
      displayed in their banners the keys of St. Peter and the German
      eagle. Gregory the Seventh, who may be adored or detested as the
      founder of the papal monarchy, was driven from Rome, and died in
      exile at Salerno. Six-and-thirty of his successors, 12 till their
      retreat to Avignon, maintained an unequal contest with the
      Romans: their age and dignity were often violated; and the
      churches, in the solemn rites of religion, were polluted with
      sedition and murder. A repetition 13 of such capricious
      brutality, without connection or design, would be tedious and
      disgusting; and I shall content myself with some events of the
      twelfth century, which represent the state of the popes and the
      city. On Holy Thursday, while Paschal officiated before the
      altar, he was interrupted by the clamors of the multitude, who
      imperiously demanded the confirmation of a favorite magistrate.
      His silence exasperated their fury; his pious refusal to mingle
      the affairs of earth and heaven was encountered with menaces, and
      oaths, that he should be the cause and the witness of the public
      ruin. During the festival of Easter, while the bishop and the
      clergy, barefooted and in procession, visited the tombs of the
      martyrs, they were twice assaulted, at the bridge of St. Angelo,
      and before the Capitol, with volleys of stones and darts. The
      houses of his adherents were levelled with the ground: Paschal
      escaped with difficulty and danger; he levied an army in the
      patrimony of St. Peter; and his last days were embittered by
      suffering and inflicting the calamities of civil war. The scenes
      that followed the election of his successor Gelasius the Second
      were still more scandalous to the church and city. Cencio
      Frangipani, 14 a potent and factious baron, burst into the
      assembly furious and in arms: the cardinals were stripped,
      beaten, and trampled under foot; and he seized, without pity or
      respect, the vicar of Christ by the throat. Gelasius was dragged
      by the hair along the ground, buffeted with blows, wounded with
      spurs, and bound with an iron chain in the house of his brutal
      tyrant. An insurrection of the people delivered their bishop: the
      rival families opposed the violence of the Frangipani; and
      Cencio, who sued for pardon, repented of the failure, rather than
      of the guilt, of his enterprise. Not many days had elapsed, when
      the pope was again assaulted at the altar. While his friends and
      enemies were engaged in a bloody contest, he escaped in his
      sacerdotal garments. In this unworthy flight, which excited the
      compassion of the Roman matrons, his attendants were scattered or
      unhorsed; and, in the fields behind the church of St. Peter, his
      successor was found alone and half dead with fear and fatigue.
      Shaking the dust from his feet, the _apostle_ withdrew from a
      city in which his dignity was insulted and his person was
      endangered; and the vanity of sacerdotal ambition is revealed in
      the involuntary confession, that one emperor was more tolerable
      than twenty. 15 These examples might suffice; but I cannot forget
      the sufferings of two pontiffs of the same age, the second and
      third of the name of Lucius. The former, as he ascended in battle
      array to assault the Capitol, was struck on the temple by a
      stone, and expired in a few days. The latter was severely wounded
      in the person of his servants. In a civil commotion, several of
      his priests had been made prisoners; and the inhuman Romans,
      reserving one as a guide for his brethren, put out their eyes,
      crowned them with ludicrous mitres, mounted them on asses with
      their faces towards the tail, and extorted an oath, that, in this
      wretched condition, they should offer themselves as a lesson to
      the head of the church. Hope or fear, lassitude or remorse, the
      characters of the men, and the circumstances of the times, might
      sometimes obtain an interval of peace and obedience; and the pope
      was restored with joyful acclamations to the Lateran or Vatican,
      from whence he had been driven with threats and violence. But the
      root of mischief was deep and perennial; and a momentary calm was
      preceded and followed by such tempests as had almost sunk the
      bark of St. Peter. Rome continually presented the aspect of war
      and discord: the churches and palaces were fortified and
      assaulted by the factions and families; and, after giving peace
      to Europe, Calistus the Second alone had resolution and power to
      prohibit the use of private arms in the metropolis. Among the
      nations who revered the apostolic throne, the tumults of Rome
      provoked a general indignation; and in a letter to his disciple
      Eugenius the Third, St. Bernard, with the sharpness of his wit
      and zeal, has stigmatized the vices of the rebellious people. 16
      “Who is ignorant,” says the monk of Clairvaux, “of the vanity and
      arrogance of the Romans? a nation nursed in sedition,
      untractable, and scorning to obey, unless they are too feeble to
      resist. When they promise to serve, they aspire to reign; if they
      swear allegiance, they watch the opportunity of revolt; yet they
      vent their discontent in loud clamors, if your doors, or your
      counsels, are shut against them. Dexterous in mischief, they have
      never learned the science of doing good. Odious to earth and
      heaven, impious to God, seditious among themselves, jealous of
      their neighbors, inhuman to strangers, they love no one, by no
      one are they beloved; and while they wish to inspire fear, they
      live in base and continual apprehension. They will not submit;
      they know not how to govern faithless to their superiors,
      intolerable to their equals, ungrateful to their benefactors, and
      alike impudent in their demands and their refusals. Lofty in
      promise, poor in execution; adulation and calumny, perfidy and
      treason, are the familiar arts of their policy.” Surely this dark
      portrait is not colored by the pencil of Christian charity; 17
      yet the features, however harsh or ugly, express a lively
      resemblance of the Roman of the twelfth century. 18

      city.]

      The Jews had rejected the Christ when he appeared among them in a
      plebeian character; and the Romans might plead their ignorance of
      his vicar when he assumed the pomp and pride of a temporal
      sovereign. In the busy age of the crusades, some sparks of
      curiosity and reason were rekindled in the Western world: the
      heresy of Bulgaria, the Paulician sect, was successfully
      transplanted into the soil of Italy and France; the Gnostic
      visions were mingled with the simplicity of the gospel; and the
      enemies of the clergy reconciled their passions with their
      conscience, the desire of freedom with the profession of piety.
      19 The trumpet of Roman liberty was first sounded by Arnold of
      Brescia, 20 whose promotion in the church was confined to the
      lowest rank, and who wore the monastic habit rather as a garb of
      poverty than as a uniform of obedience. His adversaries could not
      deny the wit and eloquence which they severely felt; they confess
      with reluctance the specious purity of his morals; and his errors
      were recommended to the public by a mixture of important and
      beneficial truths. In his theological studies, he had been the
      disciple of the famous and unfortunate Abelard, 21 who was
      likewise involved in the suspicion of heresy: but the lover of
      Eloisa was of a soft and flexible nature; and his ecclesiastic
      judges were edified and disarmed by the humility of his
      repentance. From this master, Arnold most probably imbibed some
      metaphysical definitions of the Trinity, repugnant to the taste
      of the times: his ideas of baptism and the eucharist are loosely
      censured; but a political heresy was the source of his fame and
      misfortunes. He presumed to quote the declaration of Christ, that
      his kingdom is not of this world: he boldly maintained, that the
      sword and the sceptre were intrusted to the civil magistrate;
      that temporal honors and possessions were lawfully vested in
      secular persons; that the abbots, the bishops, and the pope
      himself, must renounce either their state or their salvation; and
      that after the loss of their revenues, the voluntary tithes and
      oblations of the faithful would suffice, not indeed for luxury
      and avarice, but for a frugal life in the exercise of spiritual
      labors. During a short time, the preacher was revered as a
      patriot; and the discontent, or revolt, of Brescia against her
      bishop, was the first fruits of his dangerous lessons. But the
      favor of the people is less permanent than the resentment of the
      priest; and after the heresy of Arnold had been condemned by
      Innocent the Second, 22 in the general council of the Lateran,
      the magistrates themselves were urged by prejudice and fear to
      execute the sentence of the church. Italy could no longer afford
      a refuge; and the disciple of Abelard escaped beyond the Alps,
      till he found a safe and hospitable shelter in Zurich, now the
      first of the Swiss cantons. From a Roman station, 23 a royal
      villa, a chapter of noble virgins, Zurich had gradually increased
      to a free and flourishing city; where the appeals of the Milanese
      were sometimes tried by the Imperial commissaries. 24 In an age
      less ripe for reformation, the precursor of Zuinglius was heard
      with applause: a brave and simple people imbibed, and long
      retained, the color of his opinions; and his art, or merit,
      seduced the bishop of Constance, and even the pope’s legate, who
      forgot, for his sake, the interest of their master and their
      order. Their tardy zeal was quickened by the fierce exhortations
      of St. Bernard; 25 and the enemy of the church was driven by
      persecution to the desperate measures of erecting his standard in
      Rome itself, in the face of the successor of St. Peter.

      Chapter LXIX: State Of Rome From The Twelfth Century.—Part II.

      Yet the courage of Arnold was not devoid of discretion: he was
      protected, and had perhaps been invited, by the nobles and
      people; and in the service of freedom, his eloquence thundered
      over the seven hills. Blending in the same discourse the texts of
      Livy and St. Paul, uniting the motives of gospel, and of classic,
      enthusiasm, he admonished the Romans, how strangely their
      patience and the vices of the clergy had degenerated from the
      primitive times of the church and the city. He exhorted them to
      assert the inalienable rights of men and Christians; to restore
      the laws and magistrates of the republic; to respect the _name_
      of the emperor; but to confine their shepherd to the spiritual
      government of his flock. 26 Nor could his spiritual government
      escape the censure and control of the reformer; and the inferior
      clergy were taught by his lessons to resist the cardinals, who
      had usurped a despotic command over the twenty-eight regions or
      parishes of Rome. 27 The revolution was not accomplished without
      rapine and violence, the diffusion of blood and the demolition of
      houses: the victorious faction was enriched with the spoils of
      the clergy and the adverse nobles. Arnold of Brescia enjoyed, or
      deplored, the effects of his mission: his reign continued above
      ten years, while two popes, Innocent the Second and Anastasius
      the Fourth, either trembled in the Vatican, or wandered as exiles
      in the adjacent cities. They were succeeded by a more vigorous
      and fortunate pontiff. Adrian the Fourth, 28 the only Englishman
      who has ascended the throne of St. Peter; and whose merit emerged
      from the mean condition of a monk, and almost a beggar, in the
      monastery of St. Albans. On the first provocation, of a cardinal
      killed or wounded in the streets, he cast an interdict on the
      guilty people; and from Christmas to Easter, Rome was deprived of
      the real or imaginary comforts of religious worship. The Romans
      had despised their temporal prince: they submitted with grief and
      terror to the censures of their spiritual father: their guilt was
      expiated by penance, and the banishment of the seditious preacher
      was the price of their absolution. But the revenge of Adrian was
      yet unsatisfied, and the approaching coronation of Frederic
      Barbarossa was fatal to the bold reformer, who had offended,
      though not in an equal degree, the heads of the church and state.
      In their interview at Viterbo, the pope represented to the
      emperor the furious, ungovernable spirit of the Romans; the
      insults, the injuries, the fears, to which his person and his
      clergy were continually exposed; and the pernicious tendency of
      the heresy of Arnold, which must subvert the principles of civil,
      as well as ecclesiastical, subordination. Frederic was convinced
      by these arguments, or tempted by the desire of the Imperial
      crown: in the balance of ambition, the innocence or life of an
      individual is of small account; and their common enemy was
      sacrificed to a moment of political concord. After his retreat
      from Rome, Arnold had been protected by the viscounts of
      Campania, from whom he was extorted by the power of Cæsar: the
      præfect of the city pronounced his sentence: the martyr of
      freedom was burned alive in the presence of a careless and
      ungrateful people; and his ashes were cast into the Tyber, lest
      the heretics should collect and worship the relics of their
      master. 29 The clergy triumphed in his death: with his ashes, his
      sect was dispersed; his memory still lived in the minds of the
      Romans. From his school they had probably derived a new article
      of faith, that the metropolis of the Catholic church is exempt
      from the penalties of excommunication and interdict. Their
      bishops might argue, that the supreme jurisdiction, which they
      exercised over kings and nations, more especially embraced the
      city and diocese of the prince of the apostles. But they preached
      to the winds, and the same principle that weakened the effect,
      must temper the abuse, of the thunders of the Vatican.

      last adventures of Arnold are related by the biographer of Adrian
      IV. (Muratori. Script. Rerum Ital. tom. iii. P. i. p. 441, 442.)]

      The love of ancient freedom has encouraged a belief that as early
      as the tenth century, in their first struggles against the Saxon
      Othos, the commonwealth was vindicated and restored by the senate
      and people of Rome; that two consuls were annually elected among
      the nobles, and that ten or twelve plebeian magistrates revived
      the name and office of the tribunes of the commons. 30 But this
      venerable structure disappears before the light of criticism. In
      the darkness of the middle ages, the appellations of senators, of
      consuls, of the sons of consuls, may sometimes be discovered. 31
      They were bestowed by the emperors, or assumed by the most
      powerful citizens, to denote their rank, their honors, 32 and
      perhaps the claim of a pure and patrician descent: but they float
      on the surface, without a series or a substance, the titles of
      men, not the orders of government; 33 and it is only from the
      year of Christ one thousand one hundred and forty-four that the
      establishment of the senate is dated, as a glorious æra, in the
      acts of the city. A new constitution was hastily framed by
      private ambition or popular enthusiasm; nor could Rome, in the
      twelfth century, produce an antiquary to explain, or a legislator
      to restore, the harmony and proportions of the ancient model. The
      assembly of a free, of an armed, people, will ever speak in loud
      and weighty acclamations. But the regular distribution of the
      thirty-five tribes, the nice balance of the wealth and numbers of
      the centuries, the debates of the adverse orators, and the slow
      operations of votes and ballots, could not easily be adapted by a
      blind multitude, ignorant of the arts, and insensible of the
      benefits, of legal government. It was proposed by Arnold to
      revive and discriminate the equestrian order; but what could be
      the motive or measure of such distinction? 34 The pecuniary
      qualification of the knights must have been reduced to the
      poverty of the times: those times no longer required their civil
      functions of judges and farmers of the revenue; and their
      primitive duty, their military service on horseback, was more
      nobly supplied by feudal tenures and the spirit of chivalry. The
      jurisprudence of the republic was useless and unknown: the
      nations and families of Italy who lived under the Roman and
      Barbaric laws were insensibly mingled in a common mass; and some
      faint tradition, some imperfect fragments, preserved the memory
      of the Code and Pandects of Justinian. With their liberty the
      Romans might doubtless have restored the appellation and office
      of consuls; had they not disdained a title so promiscuously
      adopted in the Italian cities, that it has finally settled on the
      humble station of the agents of commerce in a foreign land. But
      the rights of the tribunes, the formidable word that arrested the
      public counsels, suppose or must produce a legitimate democracy.
      The old patricians were the subjects, the modern barons the
      tyrants, of the state; nor would the enemies of peace and order,
      who insulted the vicar of Christ, have long respected the unarmed
      sanctity of a plebeian magistrate. 35

      prerogative. But in general the names of _consul_ and _senator_,
      which may be found among the French and Germans, signify no more
      than count and lord, (_Signeur_, Ducange Glossar.) The monkish
      writers are often ambitious of fine classic words.]

      35 (return) [ The republican plan of Arnold of Brescia is thus
      stated by Gunther:—

               Quin etiam titulos urbis renovare vetustos; Nomine
               plebeio secernere nomen equestre, Jura tribunorum,
               sanctum reparare senatum, Et senio fessas mutasque
               reponere leges. Lapsa ruinosis, et adhuc pendentia muris
               Reddere primævo Capitolia prisca nitori.

      But of these reformations, some were no more than ideas, others
      no more than words.]

      In the revolution of the twelfth century, which gave a new
      existence and æra to Rome, we may observe the real and important
      events that marked or confirmed her political independence. I.
      The Capitoline hill, one of her seven eminences, 36 is about four
      hundred yards in length, and two hundred in breadth. A flight of
      a hundred steps led to the summit of the Tarpeian rock; and far
      steeper was the ascent before the declivities had been smoothed
      and the precipices filled by the ruins of fallen edifices. From
      the earliest ages, the Capitol had been used as a temple in
      peace, a fortress in war: after the loss of the city, it
      maintained a siege against the victorious Gauls, and the
      sanctuary of the empire was occupied, assaulted, and burnt, in
      the civil wars of Vitellius and Vespasian. 37 The temples of
      Jupiter and his kindred deities had crumbled into dust; their
      place was supplied by monasteries and houses; and the solid
      walls, the long and shelving porticos, were decayed or ruined by
      the lapse of time. It was the first act of the Romans, an act of
      freedom, to restore the strength, though not the beauty, of the
      Capitol; to fortify the seat of their arms and counsels; and as
      often as they ascended the hill, the coldest minds must have
      glowed with the remembrance of their ancestors. II. The first
      Cæsars had been invested with the exclusive coinage of the gold
      and silver; to the senate they abandoned the baser metal of
      bronze or copper: 38 the emblems and legends were inscribed on a
      more ample field by the genius of flattery; and the prince was
      relieved from the care of celebrating his own virtues. The
      successors of Diocletian despised even the flattery of the
      senate: their royal officers at Rome, and in the provinces,
      assumed the sole direction of the mint; and the same prerogative
      was inherited by the Gothic kings of Italy, and the long series
      of the Greek, the French, and the German dynasties. After an
      abdication of eight hundred years, the Roman senate asserted this
      honorable and lucrative privilege; which was tacitly renounced by
      the popes, from Paschal the Second to the establishment of their
      residence beyond the Alps. Some of these republican coins of the
      twelfth and thirteenth centuries are shown in the cabinets of the
      curious. On one of these, a gold medal, Christ is depictured
      holding in his left hand a book with this inscription: “The vow
      of the Roman senate and people: Rome the capital of the world;”
      on the reverse, St. Peter delivering a banner to a kneeling
      senator in his cap and gown, with the name and arms of his family
      impressed on a shield. 39 III. With the empire, the præfect of
      the city had declined to a municipal officer; yet he still
      exercised in the last appeal the civil and criminal jurisdiction;
      and a drawn sword, which he received from the successors of Otho,
      was the mode of his investiture and the emblem of his functions.
      40 The dignity was confined to the noble families of Rome: the
      choice of the people was ratified by the pope; but a triple oath
      of fidelity must have often embarrassed the præfect in the
      conflict of adverse duties. 41 A servant, in whom they possessed
      but a third share, was dismissed by the independent Romans: in
      his place they elected a patrician; but this title, which
      Charlemagne had not disdained, was too lofty for a citizen or a
      subject; and, after the first fervor of rebellion, they consented
      without reluctance to the restoration of the præfect. About fifty
      years after this event, Innocent the Third, the most ambitious,
      or at least the most fortunate, of the Pontiffs, delivered the
      Romans and himself from this badge of foreign dominion: he
      invested the præfect with a banner instead of a sword, and
      absolved him from all dependence of oaths or service to the
      German emperors. 42 In his place an ecclesiastic, a present or
      future cardinal, was named by the pope to the civil government of
      Rome; but his jurisdiction has been reduced to a narrow compass;
      and in the days of freedom, the right or exercise was derived
      from the senate and people. IV. After the revival of the senate,
      43 the conscript fathers (if I may use the expression) were
      invested with the legislative and executive power; but their
      views seldom reached beyond the present day; and that day was
      most frequently disturbed by violence and tumult. In its utmost
      plenitude, the order or assembly consisted of fifty-six senators,
      44 the most eminent of whom were distinguished by the title of
      counsellors: they were nominated, perhaps annually, by the
      people; and a previous choice of their electors, ten persons in
      each region, or parish, might afford a basis for a free and
      permanent constitution. The popes, who in this tempest submitted

      iii. p. 787—789.)]

      The union and vigor of a public council was dissolved in a
      lawless city; and the Romans soon adopted a more strong and
      simple mode of administration. They condensed the name and
      authority of the senate in a single magistrate, or two
      colleagues; and as they were changed at the end of a year, or of
      six months, the greatness of the trust was compensated by the
      shortness of the term. But in this transient reign, the senators
      of Rome indulged their avarice and ambition: their justice was
      perverted by the interest of their family and faction; and as
      they punished only their enemies, they were obeyed only by their
      adherents. Anarchy, no longer tempered by the pastoral care of
      their bishop, admonished the Romans that they were incapable of
      governing themselves; and they sought abroad those blessings
      which they were hopeless of finding at home. In the same age, and
      from the same motives, most of the Italian republics were
      prompted to embrace a measure, which, however strange it may
      seem, was adapted to their situation, and productive of the most
      salutary effects. 46 They chose, in some foreign but friendly
      city, an impartial magistrate of noble birth and unblemished
      character, a soldier and a statesman, recommended by the voice of
      fame and his country, to whom they delegated for a time the
      supreme administration of peace and war. The compact between the
      governor and the governed was sealed with oaths and
      subscriptions; and the duration of his power, the measure of his
      stipend, the nature of their mutual obligations, were defined
      with scrupulous precision. They swore to obey him as their lawful
      superior: he pledged his faith to unite the indifference of a
      stranger with the zeal of a patriot. At his choice, four or six
      knights and civilians, his assessors in arms and justice,
      attended the _Podesta_, 47 who maintained at his own expense a
      decent retinue of servants and horses: his wife, his son, his
      brother, who might bias the affections of the judge, were left
      behind: during the exercise of his office he was not permitted to
      purchase land, to contract an alliance, or even to accept an
      invitation in the house of a citizen; nor could he honorably
      depart till he had satisfied the complaints that might be urged
      against his government.

      Chapter LXIX: State Of Rome From The Twelfth Century.—Part III.

      It was thus, about the middle of the thirteenth century, that the
      Romans called from Bologna the senator Brancaleone, 48 whose fame
      and merit have been rescued from oblivion by the pen of an
      English historian. A just anxiety for his reputation, a clear
      foresight of the difficulties of the task, had engaged him to
      refuse the honor of their choice: the statutes of Rome were
      suspended, and his office prolonged to the term of three years.
      By the guilty and licentious he was accused as cruel; by the
      clergy he was suspected as partial; but the friends of peace and
      order applauded the firm and upright magistrate by whom those
      blessings were restored. No criminals were so powerful as to
      brave, so obscure as to elude, the justice of the senator. By his
      sentence two nobles of the Annibaldi family were executed on a
      gibbet; and he inexorably demolished, in the city and
      neighborhood, one hundred and forty towers, the strong shelters
      of rapine and mischief. The bishop, as a simple bishop, was
      compelled to reside in his diocese; and the standard of
      Brancaleone was displayed in the field with terror and effect.
      His services were repaid by the ingratitude of a people unworthy
      of the happiness which they enjoyed. By the public robbers, whom
      he had provoked for their sake, the Romans were excited to depose
      and imprison their benefactor; nor would his life have been
      spared, if Bologna had not possessed a pledge for his safety.
      Before his departure, the prudent senator had required the
      exchange of thirty hostages of the noblest families of Rome: on
      the news of his danger, and at the prayer of his wife, they were
      more strictly guarded; and Bologna, in the cause of honor,
      sustained the thunders of a papal interdict. This generous
      resistance allowed the Romans to compare the present with the
      past; and Brancaleone was conducted from the prison to the
      Capitol amidst the acclamations of a repentant people. The
      remainder of his government was firm and fortunate; and as soon
      as envy was appeased by death, his head, enclosed in a precious
      vase, was deposited on a lofty column of marble. 49

      48 (return) [ See the life and death of Brancaleone, in the
      Historia Major of Matthew Paris, p. 741, 757, 792, 797, 799, 810,

      connected Rome and St. Albans, and the resentment of the English
      clergy prompted them to rejoice when ever the popes were humbled
      and oppressed.]

      et populi protector et defensor veritatis et justitiæ imitator et
      amator, (p. 840.) A biographer of Innocent IV. (Muratori, Script.
      tom. iii. P. i. p. 591, 592) draws a less favorable portrait of
      this Ghibeline senator.]

      The impotence of reason and virtue recommended in Italy a more
      effectual choice: instead of a private citizen, to whom they
      yielded a voluntary and precarious obedience, the Romans elected
      for their senator some prince of independent power, who could
      defend them from their enemies and themselves. Charles of Anjou
      and Provence, the most ambitious and warlike monarch of the age,
      accepted at the same time the kingdom of Naples from the pope,
      and the office of senator from the Roman people. 50 As he passed
      through the city, in his road to victory, he received their oath
      of allegiance, lodged in the Lateran palace, and smoothed in a
      short visit the harsh features of his despotic character. Yet
      even Charles was exposed to the inconstancy of the people, who
      saluted with the same acclamations the passage of his rival, the
      unfortunate Conradin; and a powerful avenger, who reigned in the
      Capitol, alarmed the fears and jealousy of the popes. The
      absolute term of his life was superseded by a renewal every third
      year; and the enmity of Nicholas the Third obliged the Sicilian
      king to abdicate the government of Rome. In his bull, a perpetual
      law, the imperious pontiff asserts the truth, validity, and use
      of the donation of Constantine, not less essential to the peace
      of the city than to the independence of the church; establishes
      the annual election of the senator; and formally disqualifies all
      emperors, kings, princes, and persons of an eminent and
      conspicuous rank. 51 This prohibitory clause was repealed in his
      own behalf by Martin the Fourth, who humbly solicited the
      suffrage of the Romans. In the presence, and by the authority, of
      the people, two electors conferred, not on the pope, but on the
      noble and faithful Martin, the dignity of senator, and the
      supreme administration of the republic, 52 to hold during his
      natural life, and to exercise at pleasure by himself or his
      deputies. About fifty years afterwards, the same title was
      granted to the emperor Lewis of Bavaria; and the liberty of Rome
      was acknowledged by her two sovereigns, who accepted a municipal
      office in the government of their own metropolis.

      14, 15.]

      In the first moments of rebellion, when Arnold of Brescia had
      inflamed their minds against the church, the Romans artfully
      labored to conciliate the favor of the empire, and to recommend
      their merit and services in the cause of Cæsar. The style of
      their ambassadors to Conrad the Third and Frederic the First is a
      mixture of flattery and pride, the tradition and the ignorance of
      their own history. 53 After some complaint of his silence and
      neglect, they exhort the former of these princes to pass the
      Alps, and assume from their hands the Imperial crown. “We beseech
      your majesty not to disdain the humility of your sons and
      vassals, not to listen to the accusations of our common enemies;
      who calumniate the senate as hostile to your throne, who sow the
      seeds of discord, that they may reap the harvest of destruction.
      The pope and the _Sicilian_ are united in an impious league to
      oppose _our_ liberty and _your_ coronation. With the blessing of
      God, our zeal and courage has hitherto defeated their attempts.
      Of their powerful and factious adherents, more especially the
      Frangipani, we have taken by assault the houses and turrets: some
      of these are occupied by our troops, and some are levelled with
      the ground. The Milvian bridge, which they had broken, is
      restored and fortified for your safe passage; and your army may
      enter the city without being annoyed from the castle of St.
      Angelo. All that we have done, and all that we design, is for
      your honor and service, in the loyal hope, that you will speedily
      appear in person, to vindicate those rights which have been
      invaded by the clergy, to revive the dignity of the empire, and
      to surpass the fame and glory of your predecessors. May you fix
      your residence in Rome, the capital of the world; give laws to
      Italy, and the Teutonic kingdom; and imitate the example of
      Constantine and Justinian, 54 who, by the vigor of the senate and
      people, obtained the sceptre of the earth.” 55 But these splendid
      and fallacious wishes were not cherished by Conrad the
      Franconian, whose eyes were fixed on the Holy Land, and who died
      without visiting Rome soon after his return from the Holy Land.

      53 (return) [ These letters and speeches are preserved by Otho

      Leopold marquis of Austria; his mother, Agnes, was daughter of
      the emperor Henry IV., and he was half-brother and uncle to
      Conrad III. and Frederic I. He has left, in seven books, a

      His nephew and successor, Frederic Barbarossa, was more ambitious
      of the Imperial crown; nor had any of the successors of Otho
      acquired such absolute sway over the kingdom of Italy. Surrounded
      by his ecclesiastical and secular princes, he gave audience in
      his camp at Sutri to the ambassadors of Rome, who thus addressed
      him in a free and florid oration: “Incline your ear to the queen
      of cities; approach with a peaceful and friendly mind the
      precincts of Rome, which has cast away the yoke of the clergy,
      and is impatient to crown her legitimate emperor. Under your
      auspicious influence, may the primitive times be restored. Assert
      the prerogatives of the eternal city, and reduce under her
      monarchy the insolence of the world. You are not ignorant, that,
      in former ages, by the wisdom of the senate, by the valor and
      discipline of the equestrian order, she extended her victorious
      arms to the East and West, beyond the Alps, and over the islands
      of the ocean. By our sins, in the absence of our princes, the
      noble institution of the senate has sunk in oblivion; and with
      our prudence, our strength has likewise decreased. We have
      revived the senate, and the equestrian order: the counsels of the
      one, the arms of the other, will be devoted to your person and
      the service of the empire. Do you not hear the language of the
      Roman matron? You were a guest, I have adopted you as a citizen;
      a Transalpine stranger, I have elected you for my sovereign; 56
      and given you myself, and all that is mine. Your first and most
      sacred duty is to swear and subscribe, that you will shed your
      blood for the republic; that you will maintain in peace and
      justice the laws of the city and the charters of your
      predecessors; and that you will reward with five thousand pounds
      of silver the faithful senators who shall proclaim your titles in
      the Capitol. With the name, assume the character, of Augustus.”
      The flowers of Latin rhetoric were not yet exhausted; but
      Frederic, impatient of their vanity, interrupted the orators in
      the high tone of royalty and conquest. “Famous indeed have been
      the fortitude and wisdom of the ancient Romans; but your speech
      is not seasoned with wisdom, and I could wish that fortitude were
      conspicuous in your actions. Like all sublunary things, Rome has
      felt the vicissitudes of time and fortune. Your noblest families
      were translated to the East, to the royal city of Constantine;
      and the remains of your strength and freedom have long since been
      exhausted by the Greeks and Franks. Are you desirous of beholding
      the ancient glory of Rome, the gravity of the senate, the spirit
      of the knights, the discipline of the camp, the valor of the
      legions? you will find them in the German republic. It is not
      empire, naked and alone, the ornaments and virtues of empire have
      likewise migrated beyond the Alps to a more deserving people: 57
      they will be employed in your defence, but they claim your
      obedience. You pretend that myself or my predecessors have been
      invited by the Romans: you mistake the word; they were not
      invited, they were implored. From its foreign and domestic
      tyrants, the city was rescued by Charlemagne and Otho, whose
      ashes repose in our country; and their dominion was the price of
      your deliverance. Under that dominion your ancestors lived and
      died. I claim by the right of inheritance and possession, and who
      shall dare to extort you from my hands? Is the hand of the Franks
      58 and Germans enfeebled by age? Am I vanquished? Am I a captive?
      Am I not encompassed with the banners of a potent and invincible
      army? You impose conditions on your master; you require oaths: if
      the conditions are just, an oath is superfluous; if unjust, it is
      criminal. Can you doubt my equity? It is extended to the meanest
      of my subjects. Will not my sword be unsheathed in the defence of
      the Capitol? By that sword the northern kingdom of Denmark has
      been restored to the Roman empire. You prescribe the measure and
      the objects of my bounty, which flows in a copious but a
      voluntary stream. All will be given to patient merit; all will be
      denied to rude importunity.” 59 Neither the emperor nor the
      senate could maintain these lofty pretensions of dominion and
      liberty. United with the pope, and suspicious of the Romans,
      Frederic continued his march to the Vatican; his coronation was
      disturbed by a sally from the Capitol; and if the numbers and
      valor of the Germans prevailed in the bloody conflict, he could
      not safely encamp in the presence of a city of which he styled
      himself the sovereign. About twelve years afterwards, he besieged
      Rome, to seat an antipope in the chair of St. Peter; and twelve
      Pisan galleys were introduced into the Tyber: but the senate and
      people were saved by the arts of negotiation and the progress of
      disease; nor did Frederic or his successors reiterate the hostile
      attempt. Their laborious reigns were exercised by the popes, the
      crusades, and the independence of Lombardy and Germany: they
      courted the alliance of the Romans; and Frederic the Second
      offered in the Capitol the great standard, the _Caroccio_ of
      Milan. 60 After the extinction of the house of Swabia, they were
      banished beyond the Alps: and their last coronations betrayed the
      impotence and poverty of the Teutonic Cæsars. 61

      narrative with the Histoires des Allemands (tom. iii. iv.) by
      Schmidt, who has deserved the esteem of his countrymen.]

      Under the reign of Adrian, when the empire extended from the
      Euphrates to the ocean, from Mount Atlas to the Grampian hills, a
      fanciful historian 62 amused the Romans with the picture of their
      ancient wars. “There was a time,” says Florus, “when Tibur and
      Præneste, our summer retreats, were the objects of hostile vows
      in the Capitol, when we dreaded the shades of the Arician groves,
      when we could triumph without a blush over the nameless villages
      of the Sabines and Latins, and even Corioli could afford a title
      not unworthy of a victorious general.” The pride of his
      contemporaries was gratified by the contrast of the past and the
      present: they would have been humbled by the prospect of
      futurity; by the prediction, that after a thousand years, Rome,
      despoiled of empire, and contracted to her primæval limits, would
      renew the same hostilities, on the same ground which was then
      decorated with her villas and gardens. The adjacent territory on
      either side of the Tyber was always claimed, and sometimes
      possessed, as the patrimony of St. Peter; but the barons assumed
      a lawless independence, and the cities too faithfully copied the
      revolt and discord of the metropolis. In the twelfth and
      thirteenth centuries the Romans incessantly labored to reduce or
      destroy the contumacious vassals of the church and senate; and if
      their headstrong and selfish ambition was moderated by the pope,
      he often encouraged their zeal by the alliance of his spiritual
      arms. Their warfare was that of the first consuls and dictators,
      who were taken from the plough. The assembled in arms at the foot
      of the Capitol; sallied from the gates, plundered or burnt the
      harvests of their neighbors, engaged in tumultuary conflict, and
      returned home after an expedition of fifteen or twenty days.
      Their sieges were tedious and unskilful: in the use of victory,
      they indulged the meaner passions of jealousy and revenge; and
      instead of adopting the valor, they trampled on the misfortunes,
      of their adversaries. The captives, in their shirts, with a rope
      round their necks, solicited their pardon: the fortifications,
      and even the buildings, of the rival cities, were demolished, and
      the inhabitants were scattered in the adjacent villages. It was
      thus that the seats of the cardinal bishops, Porto, Ostia,
      Albanum, Tusculum, Præneste, and Tibur or Tivoli, were
      successively overthrown by the ferocious hostility of the Romans.
      63 Of these, 64 Porto and Ostia, the two keys of the Tyber, are
      still vacant and desolate: the marshy and unwholesome banks are
      peopled with herds of buffaloes, and the river is lost to every
      purpose of navigation and trade. The hills, which afford a shady
      retirement from the autumnal heats, have again smiled with the
      blessings of peace; Frescati has arisen near the ruins of
      Tusculum; Tibur or Tivoli has resumed the honors of a city, 65
      and the meaner towns of Albano and Palestrina are decorated with
      the villas of the cardinals and princes of Rome. In the work of
      destruction, the ambition of the Romans was often checked and
      repulsed by the neighboring cities and their allies: in the first
      siege of Tibur, they were driven from their camp; and the battles
      of Tusculum 66 and Viterbo 67 might be compared in their relative
      state to the memorable fields of Thrasymene and Cannæ. In the
      first of these petty wars, thirty thousand Romans were overthrown
      by a thousand German horse, whom Frederic Barbarossa had detached
      to the relief of Tusculum: and if we number the slain at three,
      the prisoners at two, thousand, we shall embrace the most
      authentic and moderate account. Sixty-eight years afterwards they
      marched against Viterbo in the ecclesiastical state with the
      whole force of the city; by a rare coalition the Teutonic eagle
      was blended, in the adverse banners, with the keys of St. Peter;
      and the pope’s auxiliaries were commanded by a count of Thoulouse
      and a bishop of Winchester. The Romans were discomfited with
      shame and slaughter: but the English prelate must have indulged
      the vanity of a pilgrim, if he multiplied their numbers to one
      hundred, and their loss in the field to thirty, thousand men. Had
      the policy of the senate and the discipline of the legions been
      restored with the Capitol, the divided condition of Italy would
      have offered the fairest opportunity of a second conquest. But in
      arms, the modern Romans were not _above_, and in arts, they were
      far _below_, the common level of the neighboring republics. Nor
      was their warlike spirit of any long continuance; after some
      irregular sallies, they subsided in the national apathy, in the
      neglect of military institutions, and in the disgraceful and
      dangerous use of foreign mercenaries.

      Ambition is a weed of quick and early vegetation in the vineyard
      of Christ. Under the first Christian princes, the chair of St.
      Peter was disputed by the votes, the venality, the violence, of a
      popular election: the sanctuaries of Rome were polluted with
      blood; and, from the third to the twelfth century, the church was
      distracted by the mischief of frequent schisms. As long as the
      final appeal was determined by the civil magistrate, these
      mischiefs were transient and local: the merits were tried by
      equity or favor; nor could the unsuccessful competitor long
      disturb the triumph of his rival. But after the emperors had been
      divested of their prerogatives, after a maxim had been
      established that the vicar of Christ is amenable to no earthly
      tribunal, each vacancy of the holy see might involve Christendom
      in controversy and war. The claims of the cardinals and inferior
      clergy, of the nobles and people, were vague and litigious: the
      freedom of choice was overruled by the tumults of a city that no
      longer owned or obeyed a superior. On the decease of a pope, two
      factions proceeded in different churches to a double election:
      the number and weight of votes, the priority of time, the merit
      of the candidates, might balance each other: the most respectable
      of the clergy were divided; and the distant princes, who bowed
      before the spiritual throne, could not distinguish the spurious,
      from the legitimate, idol. The emperors were often the authors of
      the schism, from the political motive of opposing a friendly to a
      hostile pontiff; and each of the competitors was reduced to
      suffer the insults of his enemies, who were not awed by
      conscience, and to purchase the support of his adherents, who
      were instigated by avarice or ambition a peaceful and perpetual
      succession was ascertained by Alexander the Third, 68 who finally
      abolished the tumultuary votes of the clergy and people, and
      defined the right of election in the sole college of cardinals.
      69 The three orders of bishops, priests, and deacons, were
      assimilated to each other by this important privilege; the
      parochial clergy of Rome obtained the first rank in the
      hierarchy: they were indifferently chosen among the nations of
      Christendom; and the possession of the richest benefices, of the
      most important bishoprics, was not incompatible with their title
      and office. The senators of the Catholic church, the coadjutors
      and legates of the supreme pontiff, were robed in purple, the
      symbol of martyrdom or royalty; they claimed a proud equality
      with kings; and their dignity was enhanced by the smallness of
      their number, which, till the reign of Leo the Tenth, seldom
      exceeded twenty or twenty-five persons. By this wise regulation,
      all doubt and scandal were removed, and the root of schism was so
      effectually destroyed, that in a period of six hundred years a
      double choice has only once divided the unity of the sacred
      college. But as the concurrence of two thirds of the votes had
      been made necessary, the election was often delayed by the
      private interest and passions of the cardinals; and while they
      prolonged their independent reign, the Christian world was left
      destitute of a head. A vacancy of almost three years had preceded
      the elevation of George the Tenth, who resolved to prevent the
      future abuse; and his bull, after some opposition, has been
      consecrated in the code of the canon law. 70 Nine days are
      allowed for the obsequies of the deceased pope, and the arrival
      of the absent cardinals; on the tenth, they are imprisoned, each
      with one domestic, in a common apartment or _conclave_, without
      any separation of walls or curtains: a small window is reserved
      for the introduction of necessaries; but the door is locked on
      both sides and guarded by the magistrates of the city, to seclude
      them from all correspondence with the world. If the election be
      not consummated in three days, the luxury of their table is
      contracted to a single dish at dinner and supper; and after the
      eighth day, they are reduced to a scanty allowance of bread,
      water, and wine. During the vacancy of the holy see, the
      cardinals are prohibited from touching the revenues, or assuming,
      unless in some rare emergency, the government of the church: all
      agreements and promises among the electors are formally annulled;
      and their integrity is fortified by their solemn oath and the
      prayers of the Catholics. Some articles of inconvenient or
      superfluous rigor have been gradually relaxed, but the principle
      of confinement is vigorous and entire: they are still urged, by
      the personal motives of health and freedom, to accelerate the
      moment of their deliverance; and the improvement of ballot or
      secret votes has wrapped the struggles of the conclave 71 in the
      silky veil of charity and politeness. 72 By these institutions
      the Romans were excluded from the election of their prince and
      bishop; and in the fever of wild and precarious liberty, they
      seemed insensible of the loss of this inestimable privilege. The
      emperor Lewis of Bavaria revived the example of the great Otho.
      After some negotiation with the magistrates, the Roman people
      were assembled 73 in the square before St. Peter’s: the pope of
      Avignon, John the Twenty-second, was deposed: the choice of his
      successor was ratified by their consent and applause. They freely
      voted for a new law, that their bishop should never be absent
      more than three months in the year, and two days’ journey from
      the city; and that if he neglected to return on the third
      summons, the public servant should be degraded and dismissed. 74
      But Lewis forgot his own debility and the prejudices of the
      times: beyond the precincts of a German camp, his useless phantom
      was rejected; the Romans despised their own workmanship; the
      antipope implored the mercy of his lawful sovereign; 75 and the
      exclusive right of the cardinals was more firmly established by
      this unseasonable attack.

      Had the election been always held in the Vatican, the rights of
      the senate and people would not have been violated with impunity.
      But the Romans forgot, and were forgotten. in the absence of the
      successors of Gregory the Seventh, who did not keep as a divine
      precept their ordinary residence in the city and diocese. The
      care of that diocese was less important than the government of
      the universal church; nor could the popes delight in a city in
      which their authority was always opposed, and their person was
      often endangered. From the persecution of the emperors, and the
      wars of Italy, they escaped beyond the Alps into the hospitable
      bosom of France; from the tumults of Rome they prudently withdrew
      to live and die in the more tranquil stations of Anagni, Perugia,
      Viterbo, and the adjacent cities. When the flock was offended or
      impoverished by the absence of the shepherd, they were recalled
      by a stern admonition, that St. Peter had fixed his chair, not in
      an obscure village, but in the capital of the world; by a
      ferocious menace, that the Romans would march in arms to destroy
      the place and people that should dare to afford them a retreat.
      They returned with timorous obedience; and were saluted with the
      account of a heavy debt, of all the losses which their desertion
      had occasioned, the hire of lodgings, the sale of provisions, and
      the various expenses of servants and strangers who attended the
      court. 76 After a short interval of peace, and perhaps of
      authority, they were again banished by new tumults, and again
      summoned by the imperious or respectful invitation of the senate.
      In these occasional retreats, the exiles and fugitives of the
      Vatican were seldom long, or far, distant from the metropolis;
      but in the beginning of the fourteenth century, the apostolic
      throne was transported, as it might seem forever, from the Tyber
      to the Rhône; and the cause of the transmigration may be deduced
      from the furious contest between Boniface the Eighth and the king
      of France. 77 The spiritual arms of excommunication and interdict
      were repulsed by the union of the three estates, and the
      privileges of the Gallican church; but the pope was not prepared
      against the carnal weapons which Philip the Fair had courage to
      employ. As the pope resided at Anagni, without the suspicion of
      danger, his palace and person were assaulted by three hundred
      horse, who had been secretly levied by William of Nogaret, a
      French minister, and Sciarra Colonna, of a noble but hostile
      family of Rome. The cardinals fled; the inhabitants of Anagni
      were seduced from their allegiance and gratitude; but the
      dauntless Boniface, unarmed and alone, seated himself in his
      chair, and awaited, like the conscript fathers of old, the swords
      of the Gauls. Nogaret, a foreign adversary, was content to
      execute the orders of his master: by the domestic enmity of
      Colonna, he was insulted with words and blows; and during a
      confinement of three days his life was threatened by the
      hardships which they inflicted on the obstinacy which they
      provoked. Their strange delay gave time and courage to the
      adherents of the church, who rescued him from sacrilegious
      violence; but his imperious soul was wounded in the vital part;
      and Boniface expired at Rome in a frenzy of rage and revenge. His
      memory is stained with the glaring vices of avarice and pride;
      nor has the courage of a martyr promoted this ecclesiastical
      champion to the honors of a saint; a magnanimous sinner, (say the
      chronicles of the times,) who entered like a fox, reigned like a
      lion, and died like a dog. He was succeeded by Benedict the
      Eleventh, the mildest of mankind. Yet he excommunicated the
      impious emissaries of Philip, and devoted the city and people of
      Anagni by a tremendous curse, whose effects are still visible to
      the eyes of superstition. 78

      Chapter LXIX: State Of Rome From The Twelfth Century.—Part IV.

      After his decease, the tedious and equal suspense of the conclave
      was fixed by the dexterity of the French faction. A specious
      offer was made and accepted, that, in the term of forty days,
      they would elect one of the three candidates who should be named
      by their opponents. The archbishop of Bourdeaux, a furious enemy
      of his king and country, was the first on the list; but his
      ambition was known; and his conscience obeyed the calls of
      fortune and the commands of a benefactor, who had been informed
      by a swift messenger that the choice of a pope was now in his
      hands. The terms were regulated in a private interview; and with
      such speed and secrecy was the business transacted, that the
      unanimous conclave applauded the elevation of Clement the Fifth.
      79 The cardinals of both parties were soon astonished by a
      summons to attend him beyond the Alps; from whence, as they soon
      discovered, they must never hope to return. He was engaged, by
      promise and affection, to prefer the residence of France; and,
      after dragging his court through Poitou and Gascony, and
      devouring, by his expense, the cities and convents on the road,
      he finally reposed at Avignon, 80 which flourished above seventy
      years 81 the seat of the Roman pontiff and the metropolis of
      Christendom. By land, by sea, by the Rhône, the position of
      Avignon was on all sides accessible; the southern provinces of
      France do not yield to Italy itself; new palaces arose for the
      accommodation of the pope and cardinals; and the arts of luxury
      were soon attracted by the treasures of the church. They were
      already possessed of the adjacent territory, the Venaissin
      county, 82 a populous and fertile spot; and the sovereignty of
      Avignon was afterwards purchased from the youth and distress of
      Jane, the first queen of Naples and countess of Provence, for the
      inadequate price of fourscore thousand florins. 83 Under the
      shadow of a French monarchy, amidst an obedient people, the popes
      enjoyed an honorable and tranquil state, to which they long had
      been strangers: but Italy deplored their absence; and Rome, in
      solitude and poverty, might repent of the ungovernable freedom
      which had driven from the Vatican the successor of St. Peter. Her
      repentance was tardy and fruitless: after the death of the old
      members, the sacred college was filled with French cardinals, 84
      who beheld Rome and Italy with abhorrence and contempt, and
      perpetuated a series of national, and even provincial, popes,
      attached by the most indissoluble ties to their native country.

      (Thomassin, Discipline de l’Eglise, tom. i. p. 1281.)]

      The progress of industry had produced and enriched the Italian
      republics: the æra of their liberty is the most flourishing
      period of population and agriculture, of manufactures and
      commerce; and their mechanic labors were gradually refined into
      the arts of elegance and genius. But the position of Rome was
      less favorable, the territory less fruitful: the character of the
      inhabitants was debased by indolence and elated by pride; and
      they fondly conceived that the tribute of subjects must forever
      nourish the metropolis of the church and empire. This prejudice
      was encouraged in some degree by the resort of pilgrims to the
      shrines of the apostles; and the last legacy of the popes, the
      institution of the holy year, 85 was not less beneficial to the
      people than to the clergy. Since the loss of Palestine, the gift
      of plenary indulgences, which had been applied to the crusades,
      remained without an object; and the most valuable treasure of the
      church was sequestered above eight years from public circulation.
      A new channel was opened by the diligence of Boniface the Eighth,
      who reconciled the vices of ambition and avarice; and the pope
      had sufficient learning to recollect and revive the secular games
      which were celebrated in Rome at the conclusion of every century.
      To sound without danger the depth of popular credulity, a sermon
      was seasonably pronounced, a report was artfully scattered, some
      aged witnesses were produced; and on the first of January of the
      year thirteen hundred, the church of St. Peter was crowded with
      the faithful, who demanded the customary indulgence of the holy
      time. The pontiff, who watched and irritated their devout
      impatience, was soon persuaded by ancient testimony of the
      justice of their claim; and he proclaimed a plenary absolution to
      all Catholics who, in the course of that year, and at every
      similar period, should respectfully visit the apostolic churches
      of St. Peter and St. Paul. The welcome sound was propagated
      through Christendom; and at first from the nearest provinces of
      Italy, and at length from the remote kingdoms of Hungary and
      Britain, the highways were thronged with a swarm of pilgrims who
      sought to expiate their sins in a journey, however costly or
      laborious, which was exempt from the perils of military service.
      All exceptions of rank or sex, of age or infirmity, were
      forgotten in the common transport; and in the streets and
      churches many persons were trampled to death by the eagerness of
      devotion. The calculation of their numbers could not be easy nor
      accurate; and they have probably been magnified by a dexterous
      clergy, well apprised of the contagion of example: yet we are
      assured by a judicious historian, who assisted at the ceremony,
      that Rome was never replenished with less than two hundred
      thousand strangers; and another spectator has fixed at two
      millions the total concourse of the year. A trifling oblation
      from each individual would accumulate a royal treasure; and two
      priests stood night and day, with rakes in their hands, to
      collect, without counting, the heaps of gold and silver that were
      poured on the altar of St. Paul. 86 It was fortunately a season
      of peace and plenty; and if forage was scarce, if inns and
      lodgings were extravagantly dear, an inexhaustible supply of
      bread and wine, of meat and fish, was provided by the policy of
      Boniface and the venal hospitality of the Romans. From a city
      without trade or industry, all casual riches will speedily
      evaporate: but the avarice and envy of the next generation
      solicited Clement the Sixth 87 to anticipate the distant period
      of the century. The gracious pontiff complied with their wishes;
      afforded Rome this poor consolation for his loss; and justified
      the change by the name and practice of the Mosaic Jubilee. 88 His
      summons was obeyed; and the number, zeal, and liberality of the
      pilgrims did not yield to the primitive festival. But they
      encountered the triple scourge of war, pestilence, and famine:
      many wives and virgins were violated in the castles of Italy; and
      many strangers were pillaged or murdered by the savage Romans, no
      longer moderated by the presence of their bishops. 89 To the
      impatience of the popes we may ascribe the successive reduction
      to fifty, thirty-three, and twenty-five years; although the
      second of these terms is commensurate with the life of Christ.
      The profusion of indulgences, the revolt of the Protestants, and
      the decline of superstition, have much diminished the value of
      the jubilee; yet even the nineteenth and last festival was a year
      of pleasure and profit to the Romans; and a philosophic smile
      will not disturb the triumph of the priest or the happiness of
      the people. 90

      In the beginning of the eleventh century, Italy was exposed to
      the feudal tyranny, alike oppressive to the sovereign and the
      people. The rights of human nature were vindicated by her
      numerous republics, who soon extended their liberty and dominion
      from the city to the adjacent country. The sword of the nobles
      was broken; their slaves were enfranchised; their castles were
      demolished; they assumed the habits of society and obedience;
      their ambition was confined to municipal honors, and in the
      proudest aristocracy of Venice on Genoa, each patrician was
      subject to the laws. 91 But the feeble and disorderly government
      of Rome was unequal to the task of curbing her rebellious sons,
      who scorned the authority of the magistrate within and without
      the walls. It was no longer a civil contention between the nobles
      and plebeians for the government of the state: the barons
      asserted in arms their personal independence; their palaces and
      castles were fortified against a siege; and their private
      quarrels were maintained by the numbers of their vassals and
      retainers. In origin and affection, they were aliens to their
      country: 92 and a genuine Roman, could such have been produced,
      might have renounced these haughty strangers, who disdained the
      appellation of citizens, and proudly styled themselves the
      princes, of Rome. 93 After a dark series of revolutions, all
      records of pedigree were lost; the distinction of surnames was
      abolished; the blood of the nations was mingled in a thousand
      channels; and the Goths and Lombards, the Greeks and Franks, the
      Germans and Normans, had obtained the fairest possessions by
      royal bounty, or the prerogative of valor. These examples might
      be readily presumed; but the elevation of a Hebrew race to the
      rank of senators and consuls is an event without a parallel in
      the long captivity of these miserable exiles. 94 In the time of
      Leo the Ninth, a wealthy and learned Jew was converted to
      Christianity, and honored at his baptism with the name of his
      godfather, the reigning Pope. The zeal and courage of Peter the
      son of Leo were signalized in the cause of Gregory the Seventh,
      who intrusted his faithful adherent with the government of
      Adrian’s mole, the tower of Crescentius, or, as it is now called,
      the castle of St. Angelo. Both the father and the son were the
      parents of a numerous progeny: their riches, the fruits of usury,
      were shared with the noblest families of the city; and so
      extensive was their alliance, that the grandson of the proselyte
      was exalted by the weight of his kindred to the throne of St.
      Peter. A majority of the clergy and people supported his cause:
      he reigned several years in the Vatican; and it is only the
      eloquence of St. Bernard, and the final triumph of Innocence the
      Second, that has branded Anacletus with the epithet of antipope.
      After his defeat and death, the posterity of Leo is no longer
      conspicuous; and none will be found of the modern nobles
      ambitious of descending from a Jewish stock. It is not my design
      to enumerate the Roman families which have failed at different
      periods, or those which are continued in different degrees of
      splendor to the present time. 95 The old consular line of the
      _Frangipani_ discover their name in the generous act of
      _breaking_ or dividing bread in a time of famine; and such
      benevolence is more truly glorious than to have enclosed, with
      their allies the _Corsi_, a spacious quarter of the city in the
      chains of their fortifications; the _Savelli_, as it should seem
      a Sabine race, have maintained their original dignity; the
      obsolete surname of the _Capizucchi_ is inscribed on the coins of
      the first senators; the _Conti_ preserve the honor, without the
      estate, of the counts of Signia; and the _Annibaldi_ must have
      been very ignorant, or very modest, if they had not descended
      from the Carthaginian hero. 96

      in concilio communi, before the senator, that they would not
      harbor or protect any malefactors, outlaws, &c.—a feeble
      security!]

      But among, perhaps above, the peers and princes of the city, I
      distinguish the rival houses of Colonna and Ursini, whose private
      story is an essential part of the annals of modern Rome. I. The
      name and arms of Colonna 97 have been the theme of much doubtful
      etymology; nor have the orators and antiquarians overlooked
      either Trajan’s pillar, or the columns of Hercules, or the pillar
      of Christ’s flagellation, or the luminous column that guided the
      Israelites in the desert. Their first historical appearance in
      the year eleven hundred and four attests the power and antiquity,
      while it explains the simple meaning, of the name. By the
      usurpation of Cavæ, the Colonna provoked the arms of Paschal the
      Second; but they lawfully held in the Campagna of Rome the
      hereditary fiefs of Zagarola and _Colonna_; and the latter of
      these towns was probably adorned with some lofty pillar, the
      relic of a villa or temple. 98 They likewise possessed one moiety
      of the neighboring city of Tusculum, a strong presumption of
      their descent from the counts of Tusculum, who in the tenth
      century were the tyrants of the apostolic see. According to their
      own and the public opinion, the primitive and remote source was
      derived from the banks of the Rhine; 99 and the sovereigns of
      Germany were not ashamed of a real or fabulous affinity with a
      noble race, which in the revolutions of seven hundred years has
      been often illustrated by merit and always by fortune. 100 About
      the end of the thirteenth century, the most powerful branch was
      composed of an uncle and six bothers, all conspicuous in arms, or
      in the honors of the church. Of these, Peter was elected senator
      of Rome, introduced to the Capitol in a triumphal car, and hailed
      in some vain acclamations with the title of Cæsar; while John and
      Stephen were declared marquis of Ancona and count of Romagna, by
      Nicholas the Fourth, a patron so partial to their family, that he
      has been delineated in satirical portraits, imprisoned as it were
      in a hollow pillar. 101 After his decease their haughty behavior
      provoked the displeasure of the most implacable of mankind. The
      two cardinals, the uncle and the nephew, denied the election of
      Boniface the Eighth; and the Colonna were oppressed for a moment
      by his temporal and spiritual arms. 102 He proclaimed a crusade
      against his personal enemies; their estates were confiscated;
      their fortresses on either side of the Tyber were besieged by the
      troops of St. Peter and those of the rival nobles; and after the
      ruin of Palestrina or Præneste, their principal seat, the ground
      was marked with a ploughshare, the emblem of perpetual
      desolation. Degraded, banished, proscribed, the six brothers, in
      disguise and danger, wandered over Europe without renouncing the
      hope of deliverance and revenge. In this double hope, the French
      court was their surest asylum; they prompted and directed the
      enterprise of Philip; and I should praise their magnanimity, had
      they respected the misfortune and courage of the captive tyrant.
      His civil acts were annulled by the Roman people, who restored
      the honors and possessions of the Colonna; and some estimate may
      be formed of their wealth by their losses, of their losses by the
      damages of one hundred thousand gold florins which were granted
      them against the accomplices and heirs of the deceased pope. All
      the spiritual censures and disqualifications were abolished 103
      by his prudent successors; and the fortune of the house was more
      firmly established by this transient hurricane. The boldness of
      Sciarra Colonna was signalized in the captivity of Boniface, and
      long afterwards in the coronation of Lewis of Bavaria; and by the
      gratitude of the emperor, the pillar in their arms was encircled
      with a royal crown. But the first of the family in fame and merit
      was the elder Stephen, whom Petrarch loved and esteemed as a hero
      superior to his own times, and not unworthy of ancient Rome.
      Persecution and exile displayed to the nations his abilities in
      peace and war; in his distress he was an object, not of pity, but
      of reverence; the aspect of danger provoked him to avow his name
      and country; and when he was asked, “Where is now your fortress?”
      he laid his hand on his heart, and answered, “Here.” He supported
      with the same virtue the return of prosperity; and, till the ruin
      of his declining age, the ancestors, the character, and the
      children of Stephen Colonna, exalted his dignity in the Roman
      republic, and at the court of Avignon. II. The Ursini migrated
      from Spoleto; 104 the sons of Ursus, as they are styled in the
      twelfth century, from some eminent person, who is only known as
      the father of their race. But they were soon distinguished among
      the nobles of Rome, by the number and bravery of their kinsmen,
      the strength of their towers, the honors of the senate and sacred
      college, and the elevation of two popes, Celestin the Third and
      Nicholas the Third, of their name and lineage. 105 Their riches
      may be accused as an early abuse of nepotism: the estates of St.
      Peter were alienated in their favor by the liberal Celestin; 106
      and Nicholas was ambitious for their sake to solicit the alliance
      of monarchs; to found new kingdoms in Lombardy and Tuscany; and
      to invest them with the perpetual office of senators of Rome. All
      that has been observed of the greatness of the Colonna will
      likewise redound to the glory of the Ursini, their constant and
      equal antagonists in the long hereditary feud, which distracted
      above two hundred and fifty years the ecclesiastical state. The
      jealously of preeminence and power was the true ground of their
      quarrel; but as a specious badge of distinction, the Colonna
      embraced the name of Ghibelines and the party of the empire; the
      Ursini espoused the title of Guelphs and the cause of the church.
      The eagle and the keys were displayed in their adverse banners;
      and the two factions of Italy most furiously raged when the
      origin and nature of the dispute were long since forgotten. 107
      After the retreat of the popes to Avignon they disputed in arms
      the vacant republic; and the mischiefs of discord were
      perpetuated by the wretched compromise of electing each year two
      rival senators. By their private hostilities the city and country
      were desolated, and the fluctuating balance inclined with their
      alternate success. But none of either family had fallen by the
      sword, till the most renowned champion of the Ursini was
      surprised and slain by the younger Stephen Colonna. 108 His
      triumph is stained with the reproach of violating the truce;
      their defeat was basely avenged by the assassination, before the
      church door, of an innocent boy and his two servants. Yet the
      victorious Colonna, with an annual colleague, was declared
      senator of Rome during the term of five years. And the muse of
      Petrarch inspired a wish, a hope, a prediction, that the generous
      youth, the son of his venerable hero, would restore Rome and
      Italy to their pristine glory; that his justice would extirpate
      the wolves and lions, the serpents and _bears_, who labored to
      subvert the eternal basis of the marble column. 109

      ecclesiastical benefice, (Villani, l. v. c. 1;) and the last
      stains of annual excommunication were purified by Sixtus V.,
      (Vita di Sisto V. tom. iii. p. 416.) Treason, sacrilege, and
      proscription are often the best titles of ancient nobility.]

               ————Vallis te proxima misit, Appenninigenæ qua prata
               virentia sylvæ Spoletana metunt armenta gregesque
               protervi.

      Monaldeschi (tom. xii. Script. Ital. p. 533) gives the Ursini a
      French origin, which may be remotely true.]

      105 (return) [ In the metrical life of Celestine V. by the
      cardinal of St. George (Muratori, tom. iii. P. i. p. 613, &c.,)
      we find a luminous, and not inelegant, passage, (l. i. c. 3, p.
      203 &c.:)—

               ————genuit quem nobilis Ursæ (_Ursi?_) Progenies, Romana
               domus, veterataque magnis Fascibus in clero, pompasque
               experta senatûs, Bellorumque manû grandi stipata
               parentum Cardineos apices necnon fastigia dudum Papatûs
               _iterata_ tenens.

      Muratori (Dissert. xlii. tom. iii.) observes, that the first
      Ursini pontificate of Celestine III. was unknown: he is inclined
      to read _Ursi_ progenies.]

      106 (return) [ Filii Ursi, quondam Clestini papæ nepotes, de
      bonis ecclesiæ Romanæ ditati, (Vit. Innocent. III. in Muratori,
      Script. tom. iii. P. i.) The partial prodigality of Nicholas III.
      is more conspicuous in Villani and Muratori. Yet the Ursini would
      disdain the nephews of a _modern_ pope.]

      107 (return) [ In his fifty-first Dissertation on the Italian
      Antiquities, Muratori explains the factions of the Guelphs and
      Ghibelines.]

      108 (return) [ Petrarch (tom. i. p. 222—230) has celebrated this
      victory according to the Colonna; but two contemporaries, a
      Florentine (Giovanni Villani, l. x. c. 220) and a Roman,
      (Ludovico Monaldeschi, p. 532—534,) are less favorable to their
      arms.]

      109 (return) [ The abbé de Sade (tom. i. Notes, p. 61—66) has
      applied the vith Canzone of Petrarch, _Spirto Gentil_, &c., to
      Stephen Colonna the younger:

               Orsi, lupi, leoni, aquile e serpi Al una gran marmorea
               _colexna_ Fanno noja sovente e à se danno.]
