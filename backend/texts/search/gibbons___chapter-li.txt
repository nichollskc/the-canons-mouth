Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs.—Part I.

     The Conquest Of Persia, Syria, Egypt, Africa, And Spain, By The
     Arabs Or Saracens.—Empire Of The Caliphs, Or Successors Of
     Mahomet.—State Of The Christians, &c., Under Their Government.

      The revolution of Arabia had not changed the character of the
      Arabs: the death of Mahomet was the signal of independence; and
      the hasty structure of his power and religion tottered to its
      foundations. A small and faithful band of his primitive disciples
      had listened to his eloquence, and shared his distress; had fled
      with the apostle from the persecution of Mecca, or had received
      the fugitive in the walls of Medina. The increasing myriads, who
      acknowledged Mahomet as their king and prophet, had been
      compelled by his arms, or allured by his prosperity. The
      polytheists were confounded by the simple idea of a solitary and
      invisible God; the pride of the Christians and Jews disdained the
      yoke of a mortal and contemporary legislator. The habits of faith
      and obedience were not sufficiently confirmed; and many of the
      new converts regretted the venerable antiquity of the law of
      Moses, or the rites and mysteries of the Catholic church; or the
      idols, the sacrifices, the joyous festivals, of their Pagan
      ancestors. The jarring interests and hereditary feuds of the
      Arabian tribes had not yet coalesced in a system of union and
      subordination; and the Barbarians were impatient of the mildest
      and most salutary laws that curbed their passions, or violated
      their customs. They submitted with reluctance to the religious
      precepts of the Koran, the abstinence from wine, the fast of the
      Ramadan, and the daily repetition of five prayers; and the alms
      and tithes, which were collected for the treasury of Medina,
      could be distinguished only by a name from the payment of a
      perpetual and ignominious tribute. The example of Mahomet had
      excited a spirit of fanaticism or imposture, and several of his
      rivals presumed to imitate the conduct, and defy the authority,
      of the living prophet. At the head of the fugitives and
      auxiliaries, the first caliph was reduced to the cities of Mecca,
      Medina, and Tayef; and perhaps the Koreish would have restored
      the idols of the Caaba, if their levity had not been checked by a
      seasonable reproof. “Ye men of Mecca, will ye be the last to
      embrace, and the first to abandon, the religion of Islam?” After
      exhorting the Moslems to confide in the aid of God and his
      apostle, Abubeker resolved, by a vigorous attack, to prevent the
      junction of the rebels. The women and children were safely lodged
      in the cavities of the mountains: the warriors, marching under
      eleven banners, diffused the terror of their arms; and the
      appearance of a military force revived and confirmed the loyalty
      of the faithful. The inconstant tribes accepted, with humble
      repentance, the duties of prayer, and fasting, and alms; and,
      after some examples of success and severity, the most daring
      apostates fell prostrate before the sword of the Lord and of
      Caled. In the fertile province of Yemanah, 1 between the Red Sea
      and the Gulf of Persia, in a city not inferior to Medina itself,
      a powerful chief (his name was Moseilama) had assumed the
      character of a prophet, and the tribe of Hanifa listened to his
      voice. A female prophetess 1111 was attracted by his reputation;
      the decencies of words and actions were spurned by these
      favorites of Heaven; 2 and they employed several days in mystic
      and amorous converse. An obscure sentence of his Koran, or book,
      is yet extant; 3 and in the pride of his mission, Moseilama
      condescended to offer a partition of the earth. The proposal was
      answered by Mahomet with contempt; but the rapid progress of the
      impostor awakened the fears of his successor: forty thousand
      Moslems were assembled under the standard of Caled; and the
      existence of their faith was resigned to the event of a decisive
      battle. 3111 In the first action they were repulsed by the loss
      of twelve hundred men; but the skill and perseverance of their
      general prevailed; their defeat was avenged by the slaughter of
      ten thousand infidels; and Moseilama himself was pierced by an
      Aethiopian slave with the same javelin which had mortally wounded
      the uncle of Mahomet. The various rebels of Arabia without a
      chief or a cause, were speedily suppressed by the power and
      discipline of the rising monarchy; and the whole nation again
      professed, and more steadfastly held, the religion of the Koran.
      The ambition of the caliphs provided an immediate exercise for
      the restless spirit of the Saracens: their valor was united in
      the prosecution of a holy war; and their enthusiasm was equally
      confirmed by opposition and victory.

      Yamanah, in Abulfeda, Descript. Arabiae, p. 60, 61. In the xiiith
      century, there were some ruins, and a few palms; but in the
      present century, the same ground is occupied by the visions and
      arms of a modern prophet, whose tenets are imperfectly known,
      (Niebuhr, Description de l’Arabie, p. 296-302.)]

      1111 (return) [ This extraordinary woman was a Christian; she was
      at the head of a numerous and flourishing sect; Moseilama
      professed to recognize her inspiration. In a personal interview
      he proposed their marriage and the union of their sects. The
      handsome person, the impassioned eloquence, and the arts of
      Moseilama, triumphed over the virtue of the prophetesa who was
      rejected with scorn by her lover, and by her notorious unchastity
      ost her influence with her own followers. Gibbon, with that
      propensity too common, especially in his later volumes, has
      selected only the grosser part of this singular adventure.—M.]

      2 (return) [ The first salutation may be transcribed, but cannot
      be translated. It was thus that Moseilama said or sung:—

 Surge tandem itaque strenue permolenda; nam stratus tibi thorus est.
 Aut in propatulo tentorio si velis, aut in abditiore cubiculo si
 malis; Aut supinam te humi exporrectam fustigabo, si velis, Aut si
 malis manibus pedibusque nixam. Aut si velis ejus (Priapi) gemino
 triente aut si malis totus veniam. Imo, totus venito, O Apostole Dei,
 clamabat foemina. Id ipsum, dicebat Moseilama, mihi quoque suggessit
 Deus.

      The prophetess Segjah, after the fall of her lover, returned to
      idolatry; but under the reign of Moawiyah, she became a
      Mussulman, and died at Bassora, (Abulfeda, Annal. vers. Reiske,
      p. 63.)]

      work of generation, in Abulpharagius (Specimen Hist. Arabum, p.
      13, and Dynast. p. 103) and Abulfeda, (Annal. p. 63.)]

      3111 (return) [ Compare a long account of this battle in Price,
      p. 42.—M.]

      From the rapid conquests of the Saracens a presumption will
      naturally arise, that the caliphs 311 commanded in person the
      armies of the faithful, and sought the crown of martyrdom in the
      foremost ranks of the battle. The courage of Abubeker, 4 Omar, 5
      and Othman, 6 had indeed been tried in the persecution and wars
      of the prophet; and the personal assurance of paradise must have
      taught them to despise the pleasures and dangers of the present
      world. But they ascended the throne in a venerable or mature age;
      and esteemed the domestic cares of religion and justice the most
      important duties of a sovereign. Except the presence of Omar at
      the siege of Jerusalem, their longest expeditions were the
      frequent pilgrimage from Medina to Mecca; and they calmly
      received the tidings of victory as they prayed or preached before
      the sepulchre of the prophet. The austere and frugal measure of
      their lives was the effect of virtue or habit, and the pride of
      their simplicity insulted the vain magnificence of the kings of
      the earth. When Abubeker assumed the office of caliph, he
      enjoined his daughter Ayesha to take a strict account of his
      private patrimony, that it might be evident whether he were
      enriched or impoverished by the service of the state. He thought
      himself entitled to a stipend of three pieces of gold, with the
      sufficient maintenance of a single camel and a black slave; but
      on the Friday of each week he distributed the residue of his own
      and the public money, first to the most worthy, and then to the
      most indigent, of the Moslems. The remains of his wealth, a
      coarse garment, and five pieces of gold, were delivered to his
      successor, who lamented with a modest sigh his own inability to
      equal such an admirable model. Yet the abstinence and humility of
      Omar were not inferior to the virtues of Abubeker: his food
      consisted of barley bread or dates; his drink was water; he
      preached in a gown that was torn or tattered in twelve places;
      and the Persian satrap, who paid his homage to the conqueror,
      found him asleep among the beggars on the steps of the mosch of
      Medina. Oeeconomy is the source of liberality, and the increase
      of the revenue enabled Omar to establish a just and perpetual
      reward for the past and present services of the faithful.
      Careless of his own emolument, he assigned to Abbas, the uncle of
      the prophet, the first and most ample allowance of twenty-five
      thousand drachms or pieces of silver. Five thousand were allotted
      to each of the aged warriors, the relics of the field of Beder;
      and the last and meanest of the companions of Mahomet was
      distinguished by the annual reward of three thousand pieces. One
      thousand was the stipend of the veterans who had fought in the
      first battles against the Greeks and Persians; and the decreasing
      pay, as low as fifty pieces of silver, was adapted to the
      respective merit and seniority of the soldiers of Omar. Under his
      reign, and that of his predecessor, the conquerors of the East
      were the trusty servants of God and the people; the mass of the
      public treasure was consecrated to the expenses of peace and war;
      a prudent mixture of justice and bounty maintained the discipline
      of the Saracens, and they united, by a rare felicity, the
      despatch and execution of despotism with the equal and frugal
      maxims of a republican government. The heroic courage of Ali, 7
      the consummate prudence of Moawiyah, 8 excited the emulation of
      their subjects; and the talents which had been exercised in the
      school of civil discord were more usefully applied to propagate
      the faith and dominion of the prophet. In the sloth and vanity of
      the palace of Damascus, the succeeding princes of the house of
      Ommiyah were alike destitute of the qualifications of statesmen
      and of saints. 9 Yet the spoils of unknown nations were
      continually laid at the foot of their throne, and the uniform
      ascent of the Arabian greatness must be ascribed to the spirit of
      the nation rather than the abilities of their chiefs. A large
      deduction must be allowed for the weakness of their enemies. The
      birth of Mahomet was fortunately placed in the most degenerate
      and disorderly period of the Persians, the Romans, and the
      Barbarians of Europe: the empires of Trajan, or even of
      Constantine or Charlemagne, would have repelled the assault of
      the naked Saracens, and the torrent of fanaticism might have been
      obscurely lost in the sands of Arabia.

      In the victorious days of the Roman republic, it had been the aim
      of the senate to confine their councils and legions to a single
      war, and completely to suppress a first enemy before they
      provoked the hostilities of a second. These timid maxims of
      policy were disdained by the magnanimity or enthusiasm of the
      Arabian caliphs. With the same vigor and success they invaded the
      successors of Augustus and those of Artaxerxes; and the rival
      monarchies at the same instant became the prey of an enemy whom
      they had been so long accustomed to despise. In the ten years of
      the administration of Omar, the Saracens reduced to his obedience
      thirty-six thousand cities or castles, destroyed four thousand
      churches or temples of the unbelievers, and edified fourteen
      hundred moschs for the exercise of the religion of Mahomet. One
      hundred years after his flight from Mecca, the arms and the reign
      of his successors extended from India to the Atlantic Ocean, over
      the various and distant provinces, which may be comprised under
      the names of, I. Persia; II. Syria; III. Egypt; IV. Africa; and,
      V. Spain. Under this general division, I shall proceed to unfold
      these memorable transactions; despatching with brevity the remote
      and less interesting conquests of the East, and reserving a
      fuller narrative for those domestic countries which had been
      included within the pale of the Roman empire. Yet I must excuse
      my own defects by a just complaint of the blindness and
      insufficiency of my guides. The Greeks, so loquacious in
      controversy, have not been anxious to celebrate the triumphs of
      their enemies. 10 After a century of ignorance, the first annals
      of the Mussulmans were collected in a great measure from the
      voice of tradition. 11 Among the numerous productions of Arabic
      and Persian literature, 12 our interpreters have selected the
      imperfect sketches of a more recent age. 13 The art and genius of
      history have ever been unknown to the Asiatics; 14 they are
      ignorant of the laws of criticism; and our monkish chronicle of
      the same period may be compared to their most popular works,
      which are never vivified by the spirit of philosophy and freedom.

      The Oriental library of a Frenchman 15 would instruct the most
      learned mufti of the East; and perhaps the Arabs might not find
      in a single historian so clear and comprehensive a narrative of
      their own exploits as that which will be deduced in the ensuing
      sheets.

      10 (return) [ For the viith and viiith century, we have scarcely
      any original evidence of the Byzantine historians, except the
      chronicles of Theophanes (Theophanis Confessoris Chronographia,
      Gr. et Lat. cum notis Jacobi Goar. Paris, 1665, in folio) and the
      Abridgment of Nicephorus, (Nicephori Patriarchae C. P. Breviarium
      Historicum, Gr. et Lat. Paris, 1648, in folio,) who both lived in
      the beginning of the ixth century, (see Hanckius de Scriptor.
      Byzant. p. 200-246.) Their contemporary, Photius, does not seem
      to be more opulent. After praising the style of Nicephorus, he
      adds, and only complains of his extreme brevity, (Phot. Bibliot.
      Cod. lxvi. p. 100.) Some additions may be gleaned from the more
      recent histories of Cedrenus and Zonaras of the xiith century.]

      11 (return) [ Tabari, or Al Tabari, a native of Taborestan, a
      famous Imam of Bagdad, and the Livy of the Arabians, finished his
      general history in the year of the Hegira 302, (A.D. 914.) At the
      request of his friends, he reduced a work of 30,000 sheets to a
      more reasonable size. But his Arabic original is known only by
      the Persian and Turkish versions. The Saracenic history of Ebn
      Amid, or Elmacin, is said to be an abridgment of the great
      Tabari, (Ockley’s Hist. of the Saracens, vol. ii. preface, p.
      xxxix. and list of authors, D’Herbelot, p. 866, 870, 1014.)]

      12 (return) [ Besides the list of authors framed by Prideaux,
      (Life of Mahomet, p. 179-189,) Ockley, (at the end of his second
      volume,) and Petit de la Croix, (Hist. de Gengiscan, p. 525-550,)
      we find in the Bibliotheque Orientale Tarikh, a catalogue of two
      or three hundred histories or chronicles of the East, of which
      not more than three or four are older than Tabari. A lively
      sketch of Oriental literature is given by Reiske, (in his
      Prodidagmata ad Hagji Chalifae librum memorialem ad calcem
      Abulfedae Tabulae Syriae, Lipsiae, 1776;) but his project and the
      French version of Petit de la Croix (Hist. de Timur Bec, tom. i.
      preface, p. xlv.) have fallen to the ground.]

      13 (return) [ The particular historians and geographers will be
      occasionally introduced. The four following titles represent the
      Annals which have guided me in this general narrative. 1. Annales
      Eutychii, Patriarchoe Alexandrini, ab Edwardo Pocockio, Oxon.
      1656, 2 vols. in 4to. A pompous edition of an indifferent author,
      translated by Pocock to gratify the Presbyterian prejudices of
      his friend Selden. 2. Historia Saracenica Georgii Elmacini, opera
      et studio Thomae Erpenii, in 4to., Lugd. Batavorum, 1625. He is
      said to have hastily translated a corrupt Ms., and his version is
      often deficient in style and sense. 3. Historia compendiosa
      Dynastiarum a Gregorio Abulpharagio, interprete Edwardo Pocockio,
      in 4to., Oxon. 1663. More useful for the literary than the civil
      history of the East. 4. Abulfedoe Annales Moslemici ad Ann.
      Hegiroe ccccvi. a Jo. Jac. Reiske, in 4to., Lipsioe, 1754. The
      best of our chronicles, both for the original and version, yet
      how far below the name of Abulfeda! We know that he wrote at
      Hamah in the xivth century. The three former were Christians of
      the xth, xiith, and xiiith centuries; the two first, natives of
      Egypt; a Melchite patriarch, and a Jacobite scribe.]

      xix. xx.) has characterized, with truth and knowledge, the two
      sorts of Arabian historians—the dry annalist, and the tumid and
      flowery orator.]

      1.) His work is an agreeable miscellany, which must gratify every
      taste; but I never can digest the alphabetical order; and I find
      him more satisfactory in the Persian than the Arabic history. The
      recent supplement from the papers of Mm. Visdelou, and Galland,
      (in folio, La Haye, 1779,) is of a different cast, a medley of
      tales, proverbs, and Chinese antiquities.]

      I. In the first year of the first caliph, his lieutenant Caled,
      the Sword of God, and the scourge of the infidels, advanced to
      the banks of the Euphrates, and reduced the cities of Anbar and
      Hira. Westward of the ruins of Babylon, a tribe of sedentary
      Arabs had fixed themselves on the verge of the desert; and Hira
      was the seat of a race of kings who had embraced the Christian
      religion, and reigned above six hundred years under the shadow of
      the throne of Persia. 16 The last of the Mondars 1611 was
      defeated and slain by Caled; his son was sent a captive to
      Medina; his nobles bowed before the successor of the prophet; the
      people was tempted by the example and success of their
      countrymen; and the caliph accepted as the first-fruits of
      foreign conquest an annual tribute of seventy thousand pieces of
      gold. The conquerors, and even their historians, were astonished
      by the dawn of their future greatness: “In the same year,” says
      Elmacin, “Caled fought many signal battles: an immense multitude
      of the infidels was slaughtered; and spoils infinite and
      innumerable were acquired by the victorious Moslems.” 17 But the
      invincible Caled was soon transferred to the Syrian war: the
      invasion of the Persian frontier was conducted by less active or
      less prudent commanders: the Saracens were repulsed with loss in
      the passage of the Euphrates; and, though they chastised the
      insolent pursuit of the Magians, their remaining forces still
      hovered in the desert of Babylon. 1711

      le Tigre, p. 125,) of the dynasty of the Almondars. The English
      scholar understood more Arabic than the mufti of Aleppo, (Ockley,
      vol. ii. p. 34: ) the French geographer is equally at home in
      every age and every climate of the world.]

      compendious term of infidels, and I often adopt (I hope without
      scandal) this characteristic mode of expression.]

      1711 (return) [ Compare throughout Malcolm, vol. ii. p. 136.—M.]

      The indignation and fears of the Persians suspended for a moment
      their intestine divisions. By the unanimous sentence of the
      priests and nobles, their queen Arzema was deposed; the sixth of
      the transient usurpers, who had arisen and vanished in three or
      four years since the death of Chosroes, and the retreat of
      Heraclius. Her tiara was placed on the head of Yezdegerd, the
      grandson of Chosroes; and the same aera, which coincides with an
      astronomical period, 18 has recorded the fall of the Sassanian
      dynasty and the religion of Zoroaster. 19 The youth and
      inexperience of the prince (he was only fifteen years of age)
      declined a perilous encounter: the royal standard was delivered
      into the hands of his general Rustam; and a remnant of thirty
      thousand regular troops was swelled in truth, or in opinion, to
      one hundred and twenty thousand subjects, or allies, of the great
      king. The Moslems, whose numbers were reenforced from twelve to
      thirty thousand, had pitched their camp in the plains of Cadesia:
      20 and their line, though it consisted of fewer men, could
      produce more soldiers, than the unwieldy host of the infidels. I
      shall here observe, what I must often repeat, that the charge of
      the Arabs was not, like that of the Greeks and Romans, the effort
      of a firm and compact infantry: their military force was chiefly
      formed of cavalry and archers; and the engagement, which was
      often interrupted and often renewed by single combats and flying
      skirmishes, might be protracted without any decisive event to the
      continuance of several days. The periods of the battle of Cadesia
      were distinguished by their peculiar appellations. The first,
      from the well-timed appearance of six thousand of the Syrian
      brethren, was denominated the day of succor. The day of
      concussion might express the disorder of one, or perhaps of both,
      of the contending armies. The third, a nocturnal tumult, received
      the whimsical name of the night of barking, from the discordant
      clamors, which were compared to the inarticulate sounds of the
      fiercest animals. The morning of the succeeding day 2011
      determined the fate of Persia; and a seasonable whirlwind drove a
      cloud of dust against the faces of the unbelievers. The clangor
      of arms was reechoed to the tent of Rustam, who, far unlike the
      ancient hero of his name, was gently reclining in a cool and
      tranquil shade, amidst the baggage of his camp, and the train of
      mules that were laden with gold and silver. On the sound of
      danger he started from his couch; but his flight was overtaken by
      a valiant Arab, who caught him by the foot, struck off his head,
      hoisted it on a lance, and instantly returning to the field of
      battle, carried slaughter and dismay among the thickest ranks of
      the Persians. The Saracens confess a loss of seven thousand five
      hundred men; 2012 and the battle of Cadesia is justly described
      by the epithets of obstinate and atrocious. 21 The standard of
      the monarchy was overthrown and captured in the field—a leathern
      apron of a blacksmith, who in ancient times had arisen the
      deliverer of Persia; but this badge of heroic poverty was
      disguised, and almost concealed, by a profusion of precious gems.
      22 After this victory, the wealthy province of Irak, or Assyria,
      submitted to the caliph, and his conquests were firmly
      established by the speedy foundation of Bassora, 23 a place which
      ever commands the trade and navigation of the Persians. As the
      distance of fourscore miles from the Gulf, the Euphrates and
      Tigris unite in a broad and direct current, which is aptly styled
      the river of the Arabs. In the midway, between the junction and
      the mouth of these famous streams, the new settlement was planted
      on the western bank: the first colony was composed of eight
      hundred Moslems; but the influence of the situation soon reared a
      flourishing and populous capital. The air, though excessively
      hot, is pure and healthy: the meadows are filled with palm-trees
      and cattle; and one of the adjacent valleys has been celebrated
      among the four paradises or gardens of Asia. Under the first
      caliphs the jurisdiction of this Arabian colony extended over the
      southern provinces of Persia: the city has been sanctified by the
      tombs of the companions and martyrs; and the vessels of Europe
      still frequent the port of Bassora, as a convenient station and
      passage of the Indian trade.

      Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs.—Part II.

      After the defeat of Cadesia, a country intersected by rivers and
      canals might have opposed an insuperable barrier to the
      victorious cavalry; and the walls of Ctesiphon or Madayn, which
      had resisted the battering-rams of the Romans, would not have
      yielded to the darts of the Saracens. But the flying Persians
      were overcome by the belief, that the last day of their religion
      and empire was at hand; the strongest posts were abandoned by
      treachery or cowardice; and the king, with a part of his family
      and treasures, escaped to Holwan at the foot of the Median hills.

      In the third month after the battle, Said, the lieutenant of
      Omar, passed the Tigris without opposition; the capital was taken
      by assault; and the disorderly resistance of the people gave a
      keener edge to the sabres of the Moslems, who shouted with
      religious transport, “This is the white palace of Chosroes; this
      is the promise of the apostle of God!” The naked robbers of the
      desert were suddenly enriched beyond the measure of their hope or
      knowledge. Each chamber revealed a new treasure secreted with
      art, or ostentatiously displayed; the gold and silver, the
      various wardrobes and precious furniture, surpassed (says
      Abulfeda) the estimate of fancy or numbers; and another historian
      defines the untold and almost infinite mass, by the fabulous
      computation of three thousands of thousands of thousands of
      pieces of gold. 24 Some minute though curious facts represent the
      contrast of riches and ignorance. From the remote islands of the
      Indian Ocean a large provision of camphire 25 had been imported,
      which is employed with a mixture of wax to illuminate the palaces
      of the East. Strangers to the name and properties of that
      odoriferous gum, the Saracens, mistaking it for salt, mingled the
      camphire in their bread, and were astonished at the bitterness of
      the taste. One of the apartments of the palace was decorated with
      a carpet of silk, sixty cubits in length, and as many in breadth:
      a paradise or garden was depictured on the ground: the flowers,
      fruits, and shrubs, were imitated by the figures of the gold
      embroidery, and the colors of the precious stones; and the ample
      square was encircled by a variegated and verdant border. 251 The
      Arabian general persuaded his soldiers to relinquish their claim,
      in the reasonable hope that the eyes of the caliph would be
      delighted with the splendid workmanship of nature and industry.
      Regardless of the merit of art, and the pomp of royalty, the
      rigid Omar divided the prize among his brethren of Medina: the
      picture was destroyed; but such was the intrinsic value of the
      materials, that the share of Ali alone was sold for twenty
      thousand drams. A mule that carried away the tiara and cuirass,
      the belt and bracelets of Chosroes, was overtaken by the
      pursuers; the gorgeous trophy was presented to the commander of
      the faithful; and the gravest of the companions condescended to
      smile when they beheld the white beard, the hairy arms, and
      uncouth figure of the veteran, who was invested with the spoils
      of the Great King. 26 The sack of Ctesiphon was followed by its
      desertion and gradual decay. The Saracens disliked the air and
      situation of the place, and Omar was advised by his general to
      remove the seat of government to the western side of the
      Euphrates. In every age, the foundation and ruin of the Assyrian
      cities has been easy and rapid: the country is destitute of stone
      and timber; and the most solid structures 27 are composed of
      bricks baked in the sun, and joined by a cement of the native
      bitumen. The name of Cufa 28 describes a habitation of reeds and
      earth; but the importance of the new capital was supported by the
      numbers, wealth, and spirit, of a colony of veterans; and their
      licentiousness was indulged by the wisest caliphs, who were
      apprehensive of provoking the revolt of a hundred thousand
      swords: “Ye men of Cufa,” said Ali, who solicited their aid, “you
      have been always conspicuous by your valor. You conquered the
      Persian king, and scattered his forces, till you had taken
      possession of his inheritance.” This mighty conquest was achieved
      by the battles of Jalula and Nehavend. After the loss of the
      former, Yezdegerd fled from Holwan, and concealed his shame and
      despair in the mountains of Farsistan, from whence Cyrus had
      descended with his equal and valiant companions. The courage of
      the nation survived that of the monarch: among the hills to the
      south of Ecbatana or Hamadan, one hundred and fifty thousand
      Persians made a third and final stand for their religion and
      country; and the decisive battle of Nehavend was styled by the
      Arabs the victory of victories. If it be true that the flying
      general of the Persians was stopped and overtaken in a crowd of
      mules and camels laden with honey, the incident, however slight
      and singular, will denote the luxurious impediments of an
      Oriental army. 29

      The geography of Persia is darkly delineated by the Greeks and
      Latins; but the most illustrious of her cities appear to be more
      ancient than the invasion of the Arabs. By the reduction of
      Hamadan and Ispahan, of Caswin, Tauris, and Rei, they gradually
      approached the shores of the Caspian Sea: and the orators of
      Mecca might applaud the success and spirit of the faithful, who
      had already lost sight of the northern bear, and had almost
      transcended the bounds of the habitable world. 30 Again, turning
      towards the West and the Roman empire, they repassed the Tigris
      over the bridge of Mosul, and, in the captive provinces of
      Armenia and Mesopotamia, embraced their victorious brethren of
      the Syrian army. From the palace of Madayn their Eastern progress
      was not less rapid or extensive. They advanced along the Tigris
      and the Gulf; penetrated through the passes of the mountains into
      the valley of Estachar or Persepolis, and profaned the last
      sanctuary of the Magian empire. The grandson of Chosroes was
      nearly surprised among the falling columns and mutilated figures;
      a sad emblem of the past and present fortune of Persia: 31 he
      fled with accelerated haste over the desert of Kirman, implored
      the aid of the warlike Segestans, and sought an humble refuge on
      the verge of the Turkish and Chinese power. But a victorious army
      is insensible of fatigue: the Arabs divided their forces in the
      pursuit of a timorous enemy; and the caliph Othman promised the
      government of Chorasan to the first general who should enter that
      large and populous country, the kingdom of the ancient Bactrians.
      The condition was accepted; the prize was deserved; the standard
      of Mahomet was planted on the walls of Herat, Merou, and Balch;
      and the successful leader neither halted nor reposed till his
      foaming cavalry had tasted the waters of the Oxus. In the public
      anarchy, the independent governors of the cities and castles
      obtained their separate capitulations: the terms were granted or
      imposed by the esteem, the prudence, or the compassion, of the
      victors; and a simple profession of faith established the
      distinction between a brother and a slave. After a noble defence,
      Harmozan, the prince or satrap of Ahwaz and Susa, was compelled
      to surrender his person and his state to the discretion of the
      caliph; and their interview exhibits a portrait of the Arabian
      manners. In the presence, and by the command, of Omar, the gay
      Barbarian was despoiled of his silken robes embroidered with
      gold, and of his tiara bedecked with rubies and emeralds: “Are
      you now sensible,” said the conqueror to his naked captive—“are
      you now sensible of the judgment of God, and of the different
      rewards of infidelity and obedience?” “Alas!” replied Harmozan,
      “I feel them too deeply. In the days of our common ignorance, we
      fought with the weapons of the flesh, and my nation was superior.
      God was then neuter: since he has espoused your quarrel, you have
      subverted our kingdom and religion.” Oppressed by this painful
      dialogue, the Persian complained of intolerable thirst, but
      discovered some apprehension lest he should be killed whilst he
      was drinking a cup of water. “Be of good courage,” said the
      caliph; “your life is safe till you have drunk this water:” the
      crafty satrap accepted the assurance, and instantly dashed the
      vase against the ground. Omar would have avenged the deceit, but
      his companions represented the sanctity of an oath; and the
      speedy conversion of Harmozan entitled him not only to a free
      pardon, but even to a stipend of two thousand pieces of gold. The
      administration of Persia was regulated by an actual survey of the
      people, the cattle, and the fruits of the earth; 32 and this
      monument, which attests the vigilance of the caliphs, might have
      instructed the philosophers of every age. 33

      The flight of Yezdegerd had carried him beyond the Oxus, and as
      far as the Jaxartes, two rivers 34 of ancient and modern renown,
      which descend from the mountains of India towards the Caspian
      Sea. He was hospitably entertained by Takhan, prince of Fargana,
      35 a fertile province on the Jaxartes: the king of Samarcand,
      with the Turkish tribes of Sogdiana and Scythia, were moved by
      the lamentations and promises of the fallen monarch; and he
      solicited, by a suppliant embassy, the more solid and powerful
      friendship of the emperor of China. 36 The virtuous Taitsong, 37
      the first of the dynasty of the Tang may be justly compared with
      the Antonines of Rome: his people enjoyed the blessings of
      prosperity and peace; and his dominion was acknowledged by
      forty-four hordes of the Barbarians of Tartary. His last
      garrisons of Cashgar and Khoten maintained a frequent intercourse
      with their neighbors of the Jaxartes and Oxus; a recent colony of
      Persians had introduced into China the astronomy of the Magi; and
      Taitsong might be alarmed by the rapid progress and dangerous
      vicinity of the Arabs. The influence, and perhaps the supplies,
      of China revived the hopes of Yezdegerd and the zeal of the
      worshippers of fire; and he returned with an army of Turks to
      conquer the inheritance of his fathers. The fortunate Moslems,
      without unsheathing their swords, were the spectators of his ruin
      and death. The grandson of Chosroes was betrayed by his servant,
      insulted by the seditious inhabitants of Merou, and oppressed,
      defeated, and pursued by his Barbarian allies. He reached the
      banks of a river, and offered his rings and bracelets for an
      instant passage in a miller’s boat. Ignorant or insensible of
      royal distress, the rustic replied, that four drams of silver
      were the daily profit of his mill, and that he would not suspend
      his work unless the loss were repaid. In this moment of
      hesitation and delay, the last of the Sassanian kings was
      overtaken and slaughtered by the Turkish cavalry, in the
      nineteenth year of his unhappy reign. 38 3811 His son Firuz, an
      humble client of the Chinese emperor, accepted the station of
      captain of his guards; and the Magian worship was long preserved
      by a colony of loyal exiles in the province of Bucharia. 3812 His
      grandson inherited the regal name; but after a faint and
      fruitless enterprise, he returned to China, and ended his days in
      the palace of Sigan. The male line of the Sassanides was extinct;
      but the female captives, the daughters of Persia, were given to
      the conquerors in servitude, or marriage; and the race of the
      caliphs and imams was ennobled by the blood of their royal
      mothers. 39

      After the fall of the Persian kingdom, the River Oxus divided the
      territories of the Saracens and of the Turks. This narrow
      boundary was soon overleaped by the spirit of the Arabs; the
      governors of Chorasan extended their successive inroads; and one
      of their triumphs was adorned with the buskin of a Turkish queen,
      which she dropped in her precipitate flight beyond the hills of
      Bochara. 40 But the final conquest of Transoxiana, 41 as well as
      of Spain, was reserved for the glorious reign of the inactive
      Walid; and the name of Catibah, the camel driver, declares the
      origin and merit of his successful lieutenant. While one of his
      colleagues displayed the first Mahometan banner on the banks of
      the Indus, the spacious regions between the Oxus, the Jaxartes,
      and the Caspian Sea, were reduced by the arms of Catibah to the
      obedience of the prophet and of the caliph. 42 A tribute of two
      millions of pieces of gold was imposed on the infidels; their
      idols were burnt or broken; the Mussulman chief pronounced a
      sermon in the new mosch of Carizme; after several battles, the
      Turkish hordes were driven back to the desert; and the emperors
      of China solicited the friendship of the victorious Arabs. To
      their industry, the prosperity of the province, the Sogdiana of
      the ancients, may in a great measure be ascribed; but the
      advantages of the soil and climate had been understood and
      cultivated since the reign of the Macedonian kings. Before the
      invasion of the Saracens, Carizme, Bochara, and Samarcand were
      rich and populous under the yoke of the shepherds of the north.
      4211 These cities were surrounded with a double wall; and the
      exterior fortification, of a larger circumference, enclosed the
      fields and gardens of the adjacent district. The mutual wants of
      India and Europe were supplied by the diligence of the Sogdian
      merchants; and the inestimable art of transforming linen into
      paper has been diffused from the manufacture of Samarcand over
      the western world. 43

      II. No sooner had Abubeker restored the unity of faith and
      government, than he despatched a circular letter to the Arabian
      tribes. “In the name of the most merciful God, to the rest of the
      true believers. Health and happiness, and the mercy and blessing
      of God, be upon you. I praise the most high God, and I pray for
      his prophet Mahomet. This is to acquaint you, that I intend to
      send the true believers into Syria 44 to take it out of the hands
      of the infidels. And I would have you know, that the fighting for
      religion is an act of obedience to God.” His messengers returned
      with the tidings of pious and martial ardor which they had
      kindled in every province; and the camp of Medina was
      successively filled with the intrepid bands of the Saracens, who
      panted for action, complained of the heat of the season and the
      scarcity of provisions, and accused with impatient murmurs the
      delays of the caliph. As soon as their numbers were complete,
      Abubeker ascended the hill, reviewed the men, the horses, and the
      arms, and poured forth a fervent prayer for the success of their
      undertaking. In person, and on foot, he accompanied the first
      day’s march; and when the blushing leaders attempted to dismount,
      the caliph removed their scruples by a declaration, that those
      who rode, and those who walked, in the service of religion, were
      equally meritorious. His instructions 45 to the chiefs of the
      Syrian army were inspired by the warlike fanaticism which
      advances to seize, and affects to despise, the objects of earthly
      ambition. “Remember,” said the successor of the prophet, “that
      you are always in the presence of God, on the verge of death, in
      the assurance of judgment, and the hope of paradise. Avoid
      injustice and oppression; consult with your brethren, and study
      to preserve the love and confidence of your troops. When you
      fight the battles of the Lord, acquit yourselves like men,
      without turning your backs; but let not your victory be stained
      with the blood of women or children. Destroy no palm-trees, nor
      burn any fields of corn. Cut down no fruit-trees, nor do any
      mischief to cattle, only such as you kill to eat. When you make
      any covenant or article, stand to it, and be as good as your
      word. As you go on, you will find some religious persons who live
      retired in monasteries, and propose to themselves to serve God
      that way: let them alone, and neither kill them nor destroy their
      monasteries: 46 And you will find another sort of people, that
      belong to the synagogue of Satan, who have shaven crowns; 47 be
      sure you cleave their skulls, and give them no quarter till they
      either turn Mahometans or pay tribute.” All profane or frivolous
      conversation, all dangerous recollection of ancient quarrels, was
      severely prohibited among the Arabs: in the tumult of a camp, the
      exercises of religion were assiduously practised; and the
      intervals of action were employed in prayer, meditation, and the
      study of the Koran. The abuse, or even the use, of wine was
      chastised by fourscore strokes on the soles of the feet, and in
      the fervor of their primitive zeal, many secret sinners revealed
      their fault, and solicited their punishment. After some
      hesitation, the command of the Syrian army was delegated to Abu
      Obeidah, one of the fugitives of Mecca, and companions of
      Mahomet; whose zeal and devotion was assuaged, without being
      abated, by the singular mildness and benevolence of his temper.
      But in all the emergencies of war, the soldiers demanded the
      superior genius of Caled; and whoever might be the choice of the
      prince, the Sword of God was both in fact and fame the foremost
      leader of the Saracens. He obeyed without reluctance; 4711 he was
      consulted without jealousy; and such was the spirit of the man,
      or rather of the times, that Caled professed his readiness to
      serve under the banner of the faith, though it were in the hands
      of a child or an enemy. Glory, and riches, and dominion, were
      indeed promised to the victorious Mussulman; but he was carefully
      instructed, that if the goods of this life were his only
      incitement, they likewise would be his only reward.

      Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs.—Part III.

      One of the fifteen provinces of Syria, the cultivated lands to
      the eastward of the Jordan, had been decorated by Roman vanity
      with the name of _Arabia_; and the first arms of the Saracens
      were justified by the semblance of a national right. The country
      was enriched by the various benefits of trade; by the vigilance
      of the emperors it was covered with a line of forts; and the
      populous cities of Gerasa, Philadelphia, and Bosra, were secure,
      at least from a surprise, by the solid structure of their walls.
      The last of these cities was the eighteenth station from Medina:
      the road was familiar to the caravans of Hejaz and Irak, who
      annually visited this plenteous market of the province and the
      desert: the perpetual jealousy of the Arabs had trained the
      inhabitants to arms; and twelve thousand horse could sally from
      the gates of Bosra, an appellation which signifies, in the Syriac
      language, a strong tower of defence. Encouraged by their first
      success against the open towns and flying parties of the borders,
      a detachment of four thousand Moslems presumed to summon and
      attack the fortress of Bosra. They were oppressed by the numbers
      of the Syrians; they were saved by the presence of Caled, with
      fifteen hundred horse: he blamed the enterprise, restored the
      battle, and rescued his friend, the venerable Serjabil, who had
      vainly invoked the unity of God and the promises of the apostle.
      After a short repose, the Moslems performed their ablutions with
      sand instead of water; and the morning prayer was recited by
      Caled before they mounted on horseback. Confident in their
      strength, the people of Bosra threw open their gates, drew their
      forces into the plain, and swore to die in the defence of their
      religion. But a religion of peace was incapable of withstanding
      the fanatic cry of “Fight, fight! Paradise, paradise!” that
      reechoed in the ranks of the Saracens; and the uproar of the
      town, the ringing of bells, and the exclamations of the priests
      and monks increased the dismay and disorder of the Christians.
      With the loss of two hundred and thirty men, the Arabs remained
      masters of the field; and the ramparts of Bosra, in expectation
      of human or divine aid, were crowded with holy crosses and
      consecrated banners. The governor Romanus had recommended an
      early submission: despised by the people, and degraded from his
      office, he still retained the desire and opportunity of revenge.
      In a nocturnal interview, he informed the enemy of a
      subterraneous passage from his house under the wall of the city;
      the son of the caliph, with a hundred volunteers, were committed
      to the faith of this new ally, and their successful intrepidity
      gave an easy entrance to their companions. After Caled had
      imposed the terms of servitude and tribute, the apostate or
      convert avowed in the assembly of the people his meritorious
      treason: “I renounce your society,” said Romanus, “both in this
      world and the world to come. And I deny him that was crucified,
      and whosoever worships him. And I choose God for my Lord, Islam
      for my faith, Mecca for my temple, the Moslems for my brethren,
      and Mahomet for my prophet; who was sent to lead us into the
      right way, and to exalt the true religion in spite of those who
      join partners with God.”

      The conquest of Bosra, four days’ journey from Damascus,
      encouraged the Arabs to besiege the ancient capital of Syria. At
      some distance from the walls, they encamped among the groves and
      fountains of that delicious territory, and the usual option of
      the Mahometan faith, of tribute or of war, was proposed to the
      resolute citizens, who had been lately strengthened by a
      reenforcement of five thousand Greeks. In the decline, as in the
      infancy, of the military art, a hostile defiance was frequently
      offered and accepted by the generals themselves: many a lance was
      shivered in the plain of Damascus, and the personal prowess of
      Caled was signalized in the first sally of the besieged. After an
      obstinate combat, he had overthrown and made prisoner one of the
      Christian leaders, a stout and worthy antagonist. He instantly
      mounted a fresh horse, the gift of the governor of Palmyra, and
      pushed forwards to the front of the battle. “Repose yourself for
      a moment,” said his friend Derar, “and permit me to supply your
      place: you are fatigued with fighting with this dog.” “O Dear!”
      replied the indefatigable Saracen, “we shall rest in the world to
      come. He that labors to-day shall rest to-morrow.” With the same
      unabated ardor, Caled answered, encountered, and vanquished a
      second champion; and the heads of his two captives who refused to
      abandon their religion were indignantly hurled into the midst of
      the city. The event of some general and partial actions reduced
      the Damascenes to a closer defence: but a messenger, whom they
      dropped from the walls, returned with the promise of speedy and
      powerful succor, and their tumultuous joy conveyed the
      intelligence to the camp of the Arabs. After some debate, it was
      resolved by the generals to raise, or rather to suspend, the
      siege of Damascus, till they had given battle to the forces of
      the emperor. In the retreat, Caled would have chosen the more
      perilous station of the rear-guard; he modestly yielded to the
      wishes of Abu Obeidah. But in the hour of danger he flew to the
      rescue of his companion, who was rudely pressed by a sally of six
      thousand horse and ten thousand foot, and few among the
      Christians could relate at Damascus the circumstances of their
      defeat. The importance of the contest required the junction of
      the Saracens, who were dispersed on the frontiers of Syria and
      Palestine; and I shall transcribe one of the circular mandates
      which was addressed to Amrou, the future conqueror of Egypt. “In
      the name of the most merciful God: from Caled to Amrou, health
      and happiness. Know that thy brethren the Moslems design to march
      to Aiznadin, where there is an army of seventy thousand Greeks,
      who purpose to come against us, _that they may extinguish the
      light of God with their mouths; but God preserveth his light in
      spite of the infidels_. As soon therefore as this letter of mine
      shall be delivered to thy hands, come with those that are with
      thee to Aiznadin, where thou shalt find us if it please the most
      high God.” The summons was cheerfully obeyed, and the forty-five
      thousand Moslems, who met on the same day, on the same spot
      ascribed to the blessing of Providence the effects of their
      activity and zeal.

      About four years after the triumph of the Persian war, the repose
      of Heraclius and the empire was again disturbed by a new enemy,
      the power of whose religion was more strongly felt, than it was
      clearly understood, by the Christians of the East. In his palace
      of Constantinople or Antioch, he was awakened by the invasion of
      Syria, the loss of Bosra, and the danger of Damascus. An army of
      seventy thousand veterans, or new levies, was assembled at Hems
      or Emesa, under the command of his general Werdan: and these
      troops consisting chiefly of cavalry, might be indifferently
      styled either Syrians, or Greeks, or Romans: _Syrians_, from the
      place of their birth or warfare; _Greeks_ from the religion and
      language of their sovereign; and _Romans_, from the proud
      appellation which was still profaned by the successors of
      Constantine. On the plain of Aiznadin, as Werdan rode on a white
      mule decorated with gold chains, and surrounded with ensigns and
      standards, he was surprised by the near approach of a fierce and
      naked warrior, who had undertaken to view the state of the enemy.
      The adventurous valor of Derar was inspired, and has perhaps been
      adorned, by the enthusiasm of his age and country. The hatred of
      the Christians, the love of spoil, and the contempt of danger,
      were the ruling passions of the audacious Saracen; and the
      prospect of instant death could never shake his religious
      confidence, or ruffle the calmness of his resolution, or even
      suspend the frank and martial pleasantry of his humor. In the
      most hopeless enterprises, he was bold, and prudent, and
      fortunate: after innumerable hazards, after being thrice a
      prisoner in the hands of the infidels, he still survived to
      relate the achievements, and to enjoy the rewards, of the Syrian
      conquest. On this occasion, his single lance maintained a flying
      fight against thirty Romans, who were detached by Werdan; and,
      after killing or unhorsing seventeen of their number, Derar
      returned in safety to his applauding brethren. When his rashness
      was mildly censured by the general, he excused himself with the
      simplicity of a soldier. “Nay,” said Derar, “I did not begin
      first: but they came out to take me, and I was afraid that God
      should see me turn my back: and indeed I fought in good earnest,
      and without doubt God assisted me against them; and had I not
      been apprehensive of disobeying your orders, I should not have
      come away as I did; and I perceive already that they will fall
      into our hands.” In the presence of both armies, a venerable
      Greek advanced from the ranks with a liberal offer of peace; and
      the departure of the Saracens would have been purchased by a gift
      to each soldier, of a turban, a robe, and a piece of gold; ten
      robes and a hundred pieces to their leader; one hundred robes and
      a thousand pieces to the caliph. A smile of indignation expressed
      the refusal of Caled. “Ye Christian dogs, you know your option;
      the Koran, the tribute, or the sword. We are a people whose
      delight is in war, rather than in peace: and we despise your
      pitiful alms, since we shall be speedily masters of your wealth,
      your families, and your persons.” Notwithstanding this apparent
      disdain, he was deeply conscious of the public danger: those who
      had been in Persia, and had seen the armies of Chosroes confessed
      that they never beheld a more formidable array. From the
      superiority of the enemy, the artful Saracen derived a fresh
      incentive of courage: “You see before you,” said he, “the united
      force of the Romans; you cannot hope to escape, but you may
      conquer Syria in a single day. The event depends on your
      discipline and patience. Reserve yourselves till the evening. It
      was in the evening that the Prophet was accustomed to vanquish.”
      During two successive engagements, his temperate firmness
      sustained the darts of the enemy, and the murmurs of his troops.
      At length, when the spirits and quivers of the adverse line were
      almost exhausted, Caled gave the signal of onset and victory. The
      remains of the Imperial army fled to Antioch, or Cæsarea, or
      Damascus; and the death of four hundred and seventy Moslems was
      compensated by the opinion that they had sent to hell above fifty
      thousand of the infidels. The spoil was inestimable; many banners
      and crosses of gold and silver, precious stones, silver and gold
      chains, and innumerable suits of the richest armor and apparel.
      The general distribution was postponed till Damascus should be
      taken; but the seasonable supply of arms became the instrument of
      new victories. The glorious intelligence was transmitted to the
      throne of the caliph; and the Arabian tribes, the coldest or most
      hostile to the prophet’s mission, were eager and importunate to
      share the harvest of Syria.

      The sad tidings were carried to Damascus by the speed of grief
      and terror; and the inhabitants beheld from their walls the
      return of the heroes of Aiznadin. Amrou led the van at the head
      of nine thousand horse: the bands of the Saracens succeeded each
      other in formidable review; and the rear was closed by Caled in
      person, with the standard of the black eagle. To the activity of
      Derar he intrusted the commission of patrolling round the city
      with two thousand horse, of scouring the plain, and of
      intercepting all succor or intelligence. The rest of the Arabian
      chiefs were fixed in their respective stations before the seven
      gates of Damascus; and the siege was renewed with fresh vigor and
      confidence. The art, the labor, the military engines, of the
      Greeks and Romans are seldom to be found in the simple, though
      successful, operations of the Saracens: it was sufficient for
      them to invest a city with arms, rather than with trenches; to
      repel the allies of the besieged; to attempt a stratagem or an
      assault; or to expect the progress of famine and discontent.
      Damascus would have acquiesced in the trial of Aiznadin, as a
      final and peremptory sentence between the emperor and the caliph;
      her courage was rekindled by the example and authority of Thomas,
      a noble Greek, illustrious in a private condition by the alliance
      of Heraclius. The tumult and illumination of the night proclaimed
      the design of the morning sally; and the Christian hero, who
      affected to despise the enthusiasm of the Arabs, employed the
      resource of a similar superstition. At the principal gate, in the
      sight of both armies, a lofty crucifix was erected; the bishop,
      with his clergy, accompanied the march, and laid the volume of
      the New Testament before the image of Jesus; and the contending
      parties were scandalized or edified by a prayer that the Son of
      God would defend his servants and vindicate his truth. The battle
      raged with incessant fury; and the dexterity of Thomas, an
      incomparable archer, was fatal to the boldest Saracens, till
      their death was revenged by a female heroine. The wife of Aban,
      who had followed him to the holy war, embraced her expiring
      husband. “Happy,” said she, “happy art thou, my dear: thou art
      gone to thy Lord, who first joined us together, and then parted
      us asunder. I will revenge thy death, and endeavor to the utmost
      of my power to come to the place where thou art, because I love
      thee. Henceforth shall no man ever touch me more, for I have
      dedicated myself to the service of God.” Without a groan, without
      a tear, she washed the corpse of her husband, and buried him with
      the usual rites. Then grasping the manly weapons, which in her
      native land she was accustomed to wield, the intrepid widow of
      Aban sought the place where his murderer fought in the thickest
      of the battle. Her first arrow pierced the hand of his
      standard-bearer; her second wounded Thomas in the eye; and the
      fainting Christians no longer beheld their ensign or their
      leader. Yet the generous champion of Damascus refused to withdraw
      to his palace: his wound was dressed on the rampart; the fight
      was continued till the evening; and the Syrians rested on their
      arms. In the silence of the night, the signal was given by a
      stroke on the great bell; the gates were thrown open, and each
      gate discharged an impetuous column on the sleeping camp of the
      Saracens. Caled was the first in arms: at the head of four
      hundred horse he flew to the post of danger, and the tears
      trickled down his iron cheeks, as he uttered a fervent
      ejaculation; “O God, who never sleepest, look upon they servants,
      and do not deliver them into the hands of their enemies.” The
      valor and victory of Thomas were arrested by the presence of the
      _Sword of God_; with the knowledge of the peril, the Moslems
      recovered their ranks, and charged the assailants in the flank
      and rear. After the loss of thousands, the Christian general
      retreated with a sigh of despair, and the pursuit of the Saracens
      was checked by the military engines of the rampart.

      After a siege of seventy days, the patience, and perhaps the
      provisions, of the Damascenes were exhausted; and the bravest of
      their chiefs submitted to the hard dictates of necessity. In the
      occurrences of peace and war, they had been taught to dread the
      fierceness of Caled, and to revere the mild virtues of Abu
      Obeidah. At the hour of midnight, one hundred chosen deputies of
      the clergy and people were introduced to the tent of that
      venerable commander. He received and dismissed them with
      courtesy. They returned with a written agreement, on the faith of
      a companion of Mahomet, that all hostilities should cease; that
      the voluntary emigrants might depart in safety, with as much as
      they could carry away of their effects; and that the tributary
      subjects of the caliph should enjoy their lands and houses, with
      the use and possession of seven churches. On these terms, the
      most respectable hostages, and the gate nearest to his camp, were
      delivered into his hands: his soldiers imitated the moderation of
      their chief; and he enjoyed the submissive gratitude of a people
      whom he had rescued from destruction. But the success of the
      treaty had relaxed their vigilance, and in the same moment the
      opposite quarter of the city was betrayed and taken by assault. A
      party of a hundred Arabs had opened the eastern gate to a more
      inexorable foe. “No quarter,” cried the rapacious and sanguinary
      Caled, “no quarter to the enemies of the Lord:” his trumpets
      sounded, and a torrent of Christian blood was poured down the
      streets of Damascus. When he reached the church of St. Mary, he
      was astonished and provoked by the peaceful aspect of his
      companions; their swords were in the scabbard, and they were
      surrounded by a multitude of priests and monks. Abu Obeidah
      saluted the general: “God,” said he, “has delivered the city into
      my hands by way of surrender, and has saved the believers the
      trouble of fighting.” “And am I not,” replied the indignant
      Caled, “am I not the lieutenant of the commander of the faithful?
      Have I not taken the city by storm? The unbelievers shall perish
      by the sword. Fall on.” The hungry and cruel Arabs would have
      obeyed the welcome command; and Damascus was lost, if the
      benevolence of Abu Obeidah had not been supported by a decent and
      dignified firmness. Throwing himself between the trembling
      citizens and the most eager of the Barbarians, he adjured them,
      by the holy name of God, to respect his promise, to suspend their
      fury, and to wait the determination of their chiefs. The chiefs
      retired into the church of St. Mary; and after a vehement debate,
      Caled submitted in some measure to the reason and authority of
      his colleague; who urged the sanctity of a covenant, the
      advantage as well as the honor which the Moslems would derive
      from the punctual performance of their word, and the obstinate
      resistance which they must encounter from the distrust and
      despair of the rest of the Syrian cities. It was agreed that the
      sword should be sheathed, that the part of Damascus which had
      surrendered to Abu Obeidah, should be immediately entitled to the
      benefit of his capitulation, and that the final decision should
      be referred to the justice and wisdom of the caliph. A large
      majority of the people accepted the terms of toleration and
      tribute; and Damascus is still peopled by twenty thousand
      Christians. But the valiant Thomas, and the free-born patriots
      who had fought under his banner, embraced the alternative of
      poverty and exile. In the adjacent meadow, a numerous encampment
      was formed of priests and laymen, of soldiers and citizens, of
      women and children: they collected, with haste and terror, their
      most precious movables; and abandoned, with loud lamentations, or
      silent anguish, their native homes, and the pleasant banks of the
      Pharpar. The inflexible soul of Caled was not touched by the
      spectacle of their distress: he disputed with the Damascenes the
      property of a magazine of corn; endeavored to exclude the
      garrison from the benefit of the treaty; consented, with
      reluctance, that each of the fugitives should arm himself with a
      sword, or a lance, or a bow; and sternly declared, that, after a
      respite of three days, they might be pursued and treated as the
      enemies of the Moslems.

      The passion of a Syrian youth completed the ruin of the exiles of
      Damascus. A nobleman of the city, of the name of Jonas, was
      betrothed to a wealthy maiden; but her parents delayed the
      consummation of his nuptials, and their daughter was persuaded to
      escape with the man whom she had chosen. They corrupted the
      nightly watchmen of the gate Keisan; the lover, who led the way,
      was encompassed by a squadron of Arabs; but his exclamation in
      the Greek tongue, “The bird is taken,” admonished his mistress to
      hasten her return. In the presence of Caled, and of death, the
      unfortunate Jonas professed his belief in one God and his apostle
      Mahomet; and continued, till the season of his martyrdom, to
      discharge the duties of a brave and sincere Mussulman. When the
      city was taken, he flew to the monastery, where Eudocia had taken
      refuge; but the lover was forgotten; the apostate was scorned;
      she preferred her religion to her country; and the justice of
      Caled, though deaf to mercy, refused to detain by force a male or
      female inhabitant of Damascus. Four days was the general confined
      to the city by the obligation of the treaty, and the urgent cares
      of his new conquest. His appetite for blood and rapine would have
      been extinguished by the hopeless computation of time and
      distance; but he listened to the importunities of Jonas, who
      assured him that the weary fugitives might yet be overtaken. At
      the head of four thousand horse, in the disguise of Christian
      Arabs, Caled undertook the pursuit. They halted only for the
      moments of prayer; and their guide had a perfect knowledge of the
      country. For a long way the footsteps of the Damascenes were
      plain and conspicuous: they vanished on a sudden; but the
      Saracens were comforted by the assurance that the caravan had
      turned aside into the mountains, and must speedily fall into
      their hands. In traversing the ridges of the Libanus, they
      endured intolerable hardships, and the sinking spirits of the
      veteran fanatics were supported and cheered by the unconquerable
      ardor of a lover. From a peasant of the country, they were
      informed that the emperor had sent orders to the colony of exiles
      to pursue without delay the road of the sea-coast, and of
      Constantinople, apprehensive, perhaps, that the soldiers and
      people of Antioch might be discouraged by the sight and the story
      of their sufferings. The Saracens were conducted through the
      territories of Gabala and Laodicea, at a cautious distance from
      the walls of the cities; the rain was incessant, the night was
      dark, a single mountain separated them from the Roman army; and
      Caled, ever anxious for the safety of his brethren, whispered an
      ominous dream in the ear of his companion. With the dawn of day,
      the prospect again cleared, and they saw before them, in a
      pleasant valley, the tents of Damascus. After a short interval of
      repose and prayer, Caled divided his cavalry into four squadrons,
      committing the first to his faithful Derar, and reserving the
      last for himself. They successively rushed on the promiscuous
      multitude, insufficiently provided with arms, and already
      vanquished by sorrow and fatigue. Except a captive, who was
      pardoned and dismissed, the Arabs enjoyed the satisfaction of
      believing that not a Christian of either sex escaped the edge of
      their cimeters. The gold and silver of Damascus was scattered
      over the camp, and a royal wardrobe of three hundred load of silk
      might clothe an army of naked Barbarians. In the tumult of the
      battle, Jonas sought and found the object of his pursuit: but her
      resentment was inflamed by the last act of his perfidy; and as
      Eudocia struggled in his hateful embraces, she struck a dagger to
      her heart. Another female, the widow of Thomas, and the real or
      supposed daughter of Heraclius, was spared and released without a
      ransom; but the generosity of Caled was the effect of his
      contempt; and the haughty Saracen insulted, by a message of
      defiance, the throne of the Cæsars. Caled had penetrated above a
      hundred and fifty miles into the heart of the Roman province: he
      returned to Damascus with the same secrecy and speed On the
      accession of Omar, the _Sword of God_ was removed from the
      command; but the caliph, who blamed the rashness, was compelled
      to applaud the vigor and conduct, of the enterprise.

      Another expedition of the conquerors of Damascus will equally
      display their avidity and their contempt for the riches of the
      present world. They were informed that the produce and
      manufactures of the country were annually collected in the fair
      of Abyla, 64 about thirty miles from the city; that the cell of a
      devout hermit was visited at the same time by a multitude of
      pilgrims; and that the festival of trade and superstition would
      be ennobled by the nuptials of the daughter of the governor of
      Tripoli. Abdallah, the son of Jaafar, a glorious and holy martyr,
      undertook, with a banner of five hundred horse, the pious and
      profitable commission of despoiling the infidels. As he
      approached the fair of Abyla, he was astonished by the report of
      this mighty concourse of Jews and Christians, Greeks, and
      Armenians, of natives of Syria and of strangers of Egypt, to the
      number of ten thousand, besides a guard of five thousand horse
      that attended the person of the bride. The Saracens paused: “For
      my own part,” said Abdallah, “I dare not go back: our foes are
      many, our danger is great, but our reward is splendid and secure,
      either in this life or in the life to come. Let every man,
      according to his inclination, advance or retire.” Not a Mussulman
      deserted his standard. “Lead the way,” said Abdallah to his
      Christian guide, “and you shall see what the companions of the
      prophet can perform.” They charged in five squadrons; but after
      the first advantage of the surprise, they were encompassed and
      almost overwhelmed by the multitude of their enemies; and their
      valiant band is fancifully compared to a white spot in the skin
      of a black camel. 65 About the hour of sunset, when their weapons
      dropped from their hands, when they panted on the verge of
      eternity, they discovered an approaching cloud of dust; they
      heard the welcome sound of the tecbir, 66 and they soon perceived
      the standard of Caled, who flew to their relief with the utmost
      speed of his cavalry. The Christians were broken by his attack,
      and slaughtered in their flight, as far as the river of Tripoli.
      They left behind them the various riches of the fair; the
      merchandises that were exposed for sale, the money that was
      brought for purchase, the gay decorations of the nuptials, and
      the governor’s daughter, with forty of her female attendants.

      The fruits, provisions, and furniture, the money, plate, and
      jewels, were diligently laden on the backs of horses, asses, and
      mules; and the holy robbers returned in triumph to Damascus. The
      hermit, after a short and angry controversy with Caled, declined
      the crown of martyrdom, and was left alive in the solitary scene
      of blood and devastation.

      Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs.—Part IV.

      Syria, 67 one of the countries that have been improved by the
      most early cultivation, is not unworthy of the preference. 68 The
      heat of the climate is tempered by the vicinity of the sea and
      mountains, by the plenty of wood and water; and the produce of a
      fertile soil affords the subsistence, and encourages the
      propagation, of men and animals. From the age of David to that of
      Heraclius, the country was overspread with ancient and
      flourishing cities: the inhabitants were numerous and wealthy;
      and, after the slow ravage of despotism and superstition, after
      the recent calamities of the Persian war, Syria could still
      attract and reward the rapacious tribes of the desert. A plain,
      of ten days’ journey, from Damascus to Aleppo and Antioch, is
      watered, on the western side, by the winding course of the
      Orontes. The hills of Libanus and Anti-Libanus are planted from
      north to south, between the Orontes and the Mediterranean; and
      the epithet of hollow (Coelesyria) was applied to a long and
      fruitful valley, which is confined in the same direction, by the
      two ridges of snowy mountains. 69 Among the cities, which are
      enumerated by Greek and Oriental names in the geography and
      conquest of Syria, we may distinguish Emesa or Hems, Heliopolis
      or Baalbec, the former as the metropolis of the plain, the latter
      as the capital of the valley. Under the last of the Caesars, they
      were strong and populous; the turrets glittered from afar: an
      ample space was covered with public and private buildings; and
      the citizens were illustrious by their spirit, or at least by
      their pride; by their riches, or at least by their luxury. In the
      days of Paganism, both Emesa and Heliopolis were addicted to the
      worship of Baal, or the sun; but the decline of their
      superstition and splendor has been marked by a singular variety
      of fortune. Not a vestige remains of the temple of Emesa, which
      was equalled in poetic style to the summits of Mount Libanus, 70
      while the ruins of Baalbec, invisible to the writers of
      antiquity, excite the curiosity and wonder of the European
      traveller. 71 The measure of the temple is two hundred feet in
      length, and one hundred in breadth: the front is adorned with a
      double portico of eight columns; fourteen may be counted on
      either side; and each column, forty-five feet in height, is
      composed of three massy blocks of stone or marble. The
      proportions and ornaments of the Corinthian order express the
      architecture of the Greeks: but as Baalbec has never been the
      seat of a monarch, we are at a loss to conceive how the expense
      of these magnificent structures could be supplied by private or
      municipal liberality. 72 From the conquest of Damascus the
      Saracens proceeded to Heliopolis and Emesa: but I shall decline
      the repetition of the sallies and combats which have been already
      shown on a larger scale. In the prosecution of the war, their
      policy was not less effectual than their sword. By short and
      separate truces they dissolved the union of the enemy; accustomed
      the Syrians to compare their friendship with their enmity;
      familiarized the idea of their language, religion, and manners;
      and exhausted, by clandestine purchase, the magazines and
      arsenals of the cities which they returned to besiege. They
      aggravated the ransom of the more wealthy, or the more obstinate;
      and Chalcis alone was taxed at five thousand ounces of gold, five
      thousand ounces of silver, two thousand robes of silk, and as
      many figs and olives as would load five thousand asses. But the
      terms of truce or capitulation were faithfully observed; and the
      lieutenant of the caliph, who had promised not to enter the walls
      of the captive Baalbec, remained tranquil and immovable in his
      tent till the jarring factions solicited the interposition of a
      foreign master. The conquest of the plain and valley of Syria was
      achieved in less than two years. Yet the commander of the
      faithful reproved the slowness of their progress; and the
      Saracens, bewailing their fault with tears of rage and
      repentance, called aloud on their chiefs to lead them forth to
      fight the battles of the Lord. In a recent action, under the
      walls of Emesa, an Arabian youth, the cousin of Caled, was heard
      aloud to exclaim, “Methinks I see the black-eyed girls looking
      upon me; one of whom, should she appear in this world, all
      mankind would die for love of her. And I see in the hand of one
      of them a handkerchief of green silk, and a cap of precious
      stones, and she beckons me, and calls out, Come hither quickly,
      for I love thee.” With these words, charging the Christians, he
      made havoc wherever he went, till, observed at length by the
      governor of Hems, he was struck through with a javelin.

      ascribe them to the Sabaeans or Aadites Non sunt in omni Syria
      aedificia magnificentiora his, (Tabula Syria p. 108.)]

      It was incumbent on the Saracens to exert the full powers of
      their valor and enthusiasm against the forces of the emperor, who
      was taught, by repeated losses, that the rovers of the desert had
      undertaken, and would speedily achieve, a regular and permanent
      conquest. From the provinces of Europe and Asia, fourscore
      thousand soldiers were transported by sea and land to Antioch and
      Caesarea: the light troops of the army consisted of sixty
      thousand Christian Arabs of the tribe of Gassan. Under the banner
      of Jabalah, the last of their princes, they marched in the van;
      and it was a maxim of the Greeks, that for the purpose of cutting
      diamond, a diamond was the most effectual. Heraclius withheld his
      person from the dangers of the field; but his presumption, or
      perhaps his despondency, suggested a peremptory order, that the
      fate of the province and the war should be decided by a single
      battle. The Syrians were attached to the standard of Rome and of
      the cross: but the noble, the citizen, the peasant, were
      exasperated by the injustice and cruelty of a licentious host,
      who oppressed them as subjects, and despised them as strangers
      and aliens. 73 A report of these mighty preparations was conveyed
      to the Saracens in their camp of Emesa, and the chiefs, though
      resolved to fight, assembled a council: the faith of Abu Obeidah
      would have expected on the same spot the glory of martyrdom; the
      wisdom of Caled advised an honorable retreat to the skirts of
      Palestine and Arabia, where they might await the succors of their
      friends, and the attack of the unbelievers. A speedy messenger
      soon returned from the throne of Medina, with the blessings of
      Omar and Ali, the prayers of the widows of the prophet, and a
      reenforcement of eight thousand Moslems. In their way they
      overturned a detachment of Greeks, and when they joined at Yermuk
      the camp of their brethren, they found the pleasing intelligence,
      that Caled had already defeated and scattered the Christian Arabs
      of the tribe of Gassan. In the neighborhood of Bosra, the springs
      of Mount Hermon descend in a torrent to the plain of Decapolis,
      or ten cities; and the Hieromax, a name which has been corrupted
      to Yermuk, is lost, after a short course, in the Lake of
      Tiberias. 74 The banks of this obscure stream were illustrated by
      a long and bloody encounter. 7411 On this momentous occasion, the
      public voice, and the modesty of Abu Obeidah, restored the
      command to the most deserving of the Moslems. Caled assumed his
      station in the front, his colleague was posted in the rear, that
      the disorder of the fugitive might be checked by his venerable
      aspect, and the sight of the yellow banner which Mahomet had
      displayed before the walls of Chaibar. The last line was occupied
      by the sister of Derar, with the Arabian women who had enlisted
      in this holy war, who were accustomed to wield the bow and the
      lance, and who in a moment of captivity had defended, against the
      uncircumcised ravishers, their chastity and religion. 75 The
      exhortation of the generals was brief and forcible: “Paradise is
      before you, the devil and hell-fire in your rear.” Yet such was
      the weight of the Roman cavalry, that the right wing of the Arabs
      was broken and separated from the main body. Thrice did they
      retreat in disorder, and thrice were they driven back to the
      charge by the reproaches and blows of the women. In the intervals
      of action, Abu Obeidah visited the tents of his brethren,
      prolonged their repose by repeating at once the prayers of two
      different hours, bound up their wounds with his own hands, and
      administered the comfortable reflection, that the infidels
      partook of their sufferings without partaking of their reward.
      Four thousand and thirty of the Moslems were buried in the field
      of battle; and the skill of the Armenian archers enabled seven
      hundred to boast that they had lost an eye in that meritorious
      service. The veterans of the Syrian war acknowledged that it was
      the hardest and most doubtful of the days which they had seen.
      But it was likewise the most decisive: many thousands of the
      Greeks and Syrians fell by the swords of the Arabs; many were
      slaughtered, after the defeat, in the woods and mountains; many,
      by mistaking the ford, were drowned in the waters of the Yermuk;
      and however the loss may be magnified, 76 the Christian writers
      confess and bewail the bloody punishment of their sins. 77
      Manuel, the Roman general, was either killed at Damascus, or took
      refuge in the monastery of Mount Sinai. An exile in the Byzantine
      court, Jabalah lamented the manners of Arabia, and his unlucky
      preference of the Christian cause. 78 He had once inclined to the
      profession of Islam; but in the pilgrimage of Mecca, Jabalah was
      provoked to strike one of his brethren, and fled with amazement
      from the stern and equal justice of the caliph. These victorious
      Saracens enjoyed at Damascus a month of pleasure and repose: the
      spoil was divided by the discretion of Abu Obeidah: an equal
      share was allotted to a soldier and to his horse, and a double
      portion was reserved for the noble coursers of the Arabian breed.

      After the battle of Yermuk, the Roman army no longer appeared in
      the field; and the Saracens might securely choose, among the
      fortified towns of Syria, the first object of their attack. They
      consulted the caliph whether they should march to Caesarea or
      Jerusalem; and the advice of Ali determined the immediate siege
      of the latter. To a profane eye, Jerusalem was the first or
      second capital of Palestine; but after Mecca and Medina, it was
      revered and visited by the devout Moslems, as the temple of the
      Holy Land which had been sanctified by the revelation of Moses,
      of Jesus, and of Mahomet himself. The son of Abu Sophian was sent
      with five thousand Arabs to try the first experiment of surprise
      or treaty; but on the eleventh day, the town was invested by the
      whole force of Abu Obeidah. He addressed the customary summons to
      the chief commanders and people of Aelia. 79

      “Health and happiness to every one that follows the right way! We
      require of you to testify that there is but one God, and that
      Mahomet is his apostle. If you refuse this, consent to pay
      tribute, and be under us forthwith. Otherwise I shall bring men
      against you who love death better than you do the drinking of
      wine or eating hog’s flesh. Nor will I ever stir from you, if it
      please God, till I have destroyed those that fight for you, and
      made slaves of your children.” But the city was defended on every
      side by deep valleys and steep ascents; since the invasion of
      Syria, the walls and towers had been anxiously restored; the
      bravest of the fugitives of Yermuk had stopped in the nearest
      place of refuge; and in the defence of the sepulchre of Christ,
      the natives and strangers might feel some sparks of the
      enthusiasm, which so fiercely glowed in the bosoms of the
      Saracens. The siege of Jerusalem lasted four months; not a day
      was lost without some action of sally or assault; the military
      engines incessantly played from the ramparts; and the inclemency
      of the winter was still more painful and destructive to the
      Arabs. The Christians yielded at length to the perseverance of
      the besiegers. The patriarch Sophronius appeared on the walls,
      and by the voice of an interpreter demanded a conference. 7911
      After a vain attempt to dissuade the lieutenant of the caliph
      from his impious enterprise, he proposed, in the name of the
      people, a fair capitulation, with this extraordinary clause, that
      the articles of security should be ratified by the authority and
      presence of Omar himself. The question was debated in the council
      of Medina; the sanctity of the place, and the advice of Ali,
      persuaded the caliph to gratify the wishes of his soldiers and
      enemies; and the simplicity of his journey is more illustrious
      than the royal pageants of vanity and oppression. The conqueror
      of Persia and Syria was mounted on a red camel, which carried,
      besides his person, a bag of corn, a bag of dates, a wooden dish,
      and a leathern bottle of water. Wherever he halted, the company,
      without distinction, was invited to partake of his homely fare,
      and the repast was consecrated by the prayer and exhortation of
      the commander of the faithful. 80 But in this expedition or
      pilgrimage, his power was exercised in the administration of
      justice: he reformed the licentious polygamy of the Arabs,
      relieved the tributaries from extortion and cruelty, and
      chastised the luxury of the Saracens, by despoiling them of their
      rich silks, and dragging them on their faces in the dirt. When he
      came within sight of Jerusalem, the caliph cried with a loud
      voice, “God is victorious. O Lord, give us an easy conquest!”
      and, pitching his tent of coarse hair, calmly seated himself on
      the ground. After signing the capitulation, he entered the city
      without fear or precaution; and courteously discoursed with the
      patriarch concerning its religious antiquities. 81 Sophronius
      bowed before his new master, and secretly muttered, in the words
      of Daniel, “The abomination of desolation is in the holy place.”
      82 At the hour of prayer they stood together in the church of the
      resurrection; but the caliph refused to perform his devotions,
      and contented himself with praying on the steps of the church of
      Constantine. To the patriarch he disclosed his prudent and
      honorable motive. “Had I yielded,” said Omar, “to your request,
      the Moslems of a future age would have infringed the treaty under
      color of imitating my example.” By his command the ground of the
      temple of Solomon was prepared for the foundation of a mosch; 83
      and, during a residence of ten days, he regulated the present and
      future state of his Syrian conquests. Medina might be jealous,
      lest the caliph should be detained by the sanctity of Jerusalem
      or the beauty of Damascus; her apprehensions were dispelled by
      his prompt and voluntary return to the tomb of the apostle. 84

      To achieve what yet remained of the Syrian war the caliph had
      formed two separate armies; a chosen detachment, under Amrou and
      Yezid, was left in the camp of Palestine; while the larger
      division, under the standard of Abu Obeidah and Caled, marched
      away to the north against Antioch and Aleppo. The latter of
      these, the Beraea of the Greeks, was not yet illustrious as the
      capital of a province or a kingdom; and the inhabitants, by
      anticipating their submission and pleading their poverty,
      obtained a moderate composition for their lives and religion. But
      the castle of Aleppo, 85 distinct from the city, stood erect on a
      lofty artificial mound; the sides were sharpened to a precipice,
      and faced with free-stone; and the breadth of the ditch might be
      filled with water from the neighboring springs. After the loss of
      three thousand men, the garrison was still equal to the defence;
      and Youkinna, their valiant and hereditary chief, had murdered
      his brother, a holy monk, for daring to pronounce the name of
      peace. In a siege of four or five months, the hardest of the
      Syrian war, great numbers of the Saracens were killed and
      wounded: their removal to the distance of a mile could not seduce
      the vigilance of Youkinna; nor could the Christians be terrified
      by the execution of three hundred captives, whom they beheaded
      before the castle wall. The silence, and at length the
      complaints, of Abu Obeidah informed the caliph that their hope
      and patience were consumed at the foot of this impregnable
      fortress. “I am variously affected,” replied Omar, “by the
      difference of your success; but I charge you by no means to raise
      the siege of the castle. Your retreat would diminish the
      reputation of our arms, and encourage the infidels to fall upon
      you on all sides. Remain before Aleppo till God shall determine
      the event, and forage with your horse round the adjacent
      country.” The exhortation of the commander of the faithful was
      fortified by a supply of volunteers from all the tribes of
      Arabia, who arrived in the camp on horses or camels. Among these
      was Dames, of a servile birth, but of gigantic size and intrepid
      resolution. The forty-seventh day of his service he proposed,
      with only thirty men, to make an attempt on the castle. The
      experience and testimony of Caled recommended his offer; and Abu
      Obeidah admonished his brethren not to despise the baser origin
      of Dames, since he himself, could he relinquish the public care,
      would cheerfully serve under the banner of the slave. His design
      was covered by the appearance of a retreat; and the camp of the
      Saracens was pitched about a league from Aleppo. The thirty
      adventurers lay in ambush at the foot of the hill; and Dames at
      length succeeded in his inquiries, though he was provoked by the
      ignorance of his Greek captives. “God curse these dogs,” said the
      illiterate Arab; “what a strange barbarous language they speak!”
      At the darkest hour of the night, he scaled the most accessible
      height, which he had diligently surveyed, a place where the
      stones were less entire, or the slope less perpendicular, or the
      guard less vigilant. Seven of the stoutest Saracens mounted on
      each other’s shoulders, and the weight of the column was
      sustained on the broad and sinewy back of the gigantic slave. The
      foremost in this painful ascent could grasp and climb the lowest
      part of the battlements; they silently stabbed and cast down the
      sentinels; and the thirty brethren, repeating a pious
      ejaculation, “O apostle of God, help and deliver us!” were
      successively drawn up by the long folds of their turbans. With
      bold and cautious footsteps, Dames explored the palace of the
      governor, who celebrated, in riotous merriment, the festival of
      his deliverance. From thence, returning to his companions, he
      assaulted on the inside the entrance of the castle. They
      overpowered the guard, unbolted the gate, let down the
      drawbridge, and defended the narrow pass, till the arrival of
      Caled, with the dawn of day, relieved their danger and assured
      their conquest. Youkinna, a formidable foe, became an active and
      useful proselyte; and the general of the Saracens expressed his
      regard for the most humble merit, by detaining the army at Aleppo
      till Dames was cured of his honorable wounds. The capital of
      Syria was still covered by the castle of Aazaz and the iron
      bridge of the Orontes. After the loss of those important posts,
      and the defeat of the last of the Roman armies, the luxury of
      Antioch 86 trembled and obeyed. Her safety was ransomed with
      three hundred thousand pieces of gold; but the throne of the
      successors of Alexander, the seat of the Roman government of the
      East, which had been decorated by Caesar with the titles of free,
      and holy, and inviolate was degraded under the yoke of the
      caliphs to the secondary rank of a provincial town. 87

      85 (return) [ The Persian historian of Timur (tom. iii. l. v. c.
      21, p. 300) describes the castle of Aleppo as founded on a rock

      translator, that he had never visited the place. It is now in the
      midst of the city, of no strength with a single gate; the circuit
      is about 500 or 600 paces, and the ditch half full of stagnant
      water, (Voyages de Tavernier, tom. i. p. 149 Pocock, vol. ii.

      (Ockley, vol. i. p. 314) assigns that event to Tuesday, August
      21st, an inconsistent date; since Easter fell that year on April
      5th, the 21st of August must have been a Friday, (see the Tables
      of the Art de Verifier les Dates.)]

      gross ignorance of general history.]

      In the life of Heraclius, the glories of the Persian war are
      clouded on either hand by the disgrace and weakness of his more
      early and his later days. When the successors of Mahomet
      unsheathed the sword of war and religion, he was astonished at
      the boundless prospect of toil and danger; his nature was
      indolent, nor could the infirm and frigid age of the emperor be
      kindled to a second effort. The sense of shame, and the
      importunities of the Syrians, prevented the hasty departure from
      the scene of action; but the hero was no more; and the loss of
      Damascus and Jerusalem, the bloody fields of Aiznadin and Yermuk,
      may be imputed in some degree to the absence or misconduct of the
      sovereign. Instead of defending the sepulchre of Christ, he
      involved the church and state in a metaphysical controversy for
      the unity of his will; and while Heraclius crowned the offspring
      of his second nuptials, he was tamely stripped of the most
      valuable part of their inheritance. In the cathedral of Antioch,
      in the presence of the bishops, at the foot of the crucifix, he
      bewailed the sins of the prince and people; but his confession
      instructed the world, that it was vain, and perhaps impious, to
      resist the judgment of God. The Saracens were invincible in fact,
      since they were invincible in opinion; and the desertion of
      Youkinna, his false repentance and repeated perfidy, might
      justify the suspicion of the emperor, that he was encompassed by
      traitors and apostates, who conspired to betray his person and
      their country to the enemies of Christ. In the hour of adversity,
      his superstition was agitated by the omens and dreams of a
      falling crown; and after bidding an eternal farewell to Syria, he
      secretly embarked with a few attendants, and absolved the faith
      of his subjects. 88 Constantine, his eldest son, had been
      stationed with forty thousand men at Caesarea, the civil
      metropolis of the three provinces of Palestine. But his private
      interest recalled him to the Byzantine court; and, after the
      flight of his father, he felt himself an unequal champion to the
      united force of the caliph. His vanguard was boldly attacked by
      three hundred Arabs and a thousand black slaves, who, in the
      depth of winter, had climbed the snowy mountains of Libanus, and
      who were speedily followed by the victorious squadrons of Caled
      himself. From the north and south the troops of Antioch and
      Jerusalem advanced along the sea-shore till their banners were
      joined under the walls of the Phoenician cities: Tripoli and Tyre
      were betrayed; and a fleet of fifty transports, which entered
      without distrust the captive harbors, brought a seasonable supply
      of arms and provisions to the camp of the Saracens. Their labors
      were terminated by the unexpected surrender of Caesarea: the
      Roman prince had embarked in the night; 89 and the defenceless
      citizens solicited their pardon with an offering of two hundred
      thousand pieces of gold. The remainder of the province, Ramlah,
      Ptolemais or Acre, Sichem or Neapolis, Gaza, Ascalon, Berytus,
      Sidon, Gabala, Laodicea, Apamea, Hierapolis, no longer presumed
      to dispute the will of the conqueror; and Syria bowed under the
      sceptre of the caliphs seven hundred years after Pompey had
      despoiled the last of the Macedonian kings. 90

      Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs.—Part V.

      The sieges and battles of six campaigns had consumed many
      thousands of the Moslems. They died with the reputation and the
      cheerfulness of martyrs; and the simplicity of their faith may be
      expressed in the words of an Arabian youth, when he embraced, for
      the last time, his sister and mother: “It is not,” said he, “the
      delicacies of Syria, or the fading delights of this world, that
      have prompted me to devote my life in the cause of religion. But
      I seek the favor of God and his apostle; and I have heard, from
      one of the companions of the prophet, that the spirits of the
      martyrs will be lodged in the crops of green birds, who shall
      taste the fruits, and drink of the rivers, of paradise. Farewell,
      we shall meet again among the groves and fountains which God has
      provided for his elect.” The faithful captives might exercise a
      passive and more arduous resolution; and a cousin of Mahomet is
      celebrated for refusing, after an abstinence of three days, the
      wine and pork, the only nourishment that was allowed by the
      malice of the infidels. The frailty of some weaker brethren
      exasperated the implacable spirit of fanaticism; and the father
      of Amer deplored, in pathetic strains, the apostasy and damnation
      of a son, who had renounced the promises of God, and the
      intercession of the prophet, to occupy, with the priests and
      deacons, the lowest mansions of hell. The more fortunate Arabs,
      who survived the war and persevered in the faith, were restrained
      by their abstemious leader from the abuse of prosperity. After a
      refreshment of three days, Abu Obeidah withdrew his troops from
      the pernicious contagion of the luxury of Antioch, and assured
      the caliph that their religion and virtue could only be preserved
      by the hard discipline of poverty and labor. But the virtue of
      Omar, however rigorous to himself, was kind and liberal to his
      brethren. After a just tribute of praise and thanksgiving, he
      dropped a tear of compassion; and sitting down on the ground,
      wrote an answer, in which he mildly censured the severity of his
      lieutenant: “God,” said the successor of the prophet, “has not
      forbidden the use of the good things of this worl to faithful
      men, and such as have performed good works. Therefore you ought
      to have given them leave to rest themselves, and partake freely
      of those good things which the country affordeth. If any of the
      Saracens have no family in Arabia, they may marry in Syria; and
      whosoever of them wants any female slaves, he may purchase as
      many as he hath occasion for.” The conquerors prepared to use, or
      to abuse, this gracious permission; but the year of their triumph
      was marked by a mortality of men and cattle; and twenty-five
      thousand Saracens were snatched away from the possession of
      Syria. The death of Abu Obeidah might be lamented by the
      Christians; but his brethren recollected that he was one of the
      ten elect whom the prophet had named as the heirs of paradise. 91
      Caled survived his brethren about three years: and the tomb of
      the Sword of God is shown in the neighborhood of Emesa. His
      valor, which founded in Arabia and Syria the empire of the
      caliphs, was fortified by the opinion of a special providence;
      and as long as he wore a cap, which had been blessed by Mahomet,
      he deemed himself invulnerable amidst the darts of the infidels.

      it would be Omar; and that in a general calamity, Omar would be
      accepted by the divine justice, (Ockley, vol. i. p. 221.)]

      p. 90,) after having been deprived of his ample share of the
      plunder of Syria by the jealousy of Omar, died, possessed only of
      his horse, his arms, and a single slave. Yet Omar was obliged to
      acknowledge to his lamenting parent. that never mother had
      produced a son like Khaled.—M.]

      The place of the first conquerors was supplied by a new
      generation of their children and countrymen: Syria became the
      seat and support of the house of Ommiyah; and the revenue, the
      soldiers, the ships of that powerful kingdom were consecrated to
      enlarge on every side the empire of the caliphs. But the Saracens
      despise a superfluity of fame; and their historians scarcely
      condescend to mention the subordinate conquests which are lost in
      the splendor and rapidity of their victorious career.

      To the north of Syria, they passed Mount Taurus, and reduced to
      their obedience the province of Cilicia, with its capital Tarsus,
      the ancient monument of the Assyrian kings. Beyond a second ridge
      of the same mountains, they spread the flame of war, rather than
      the light of religion, as far as the shores of the Euxine, and
      the neighborhood of Constantinople. To the east they advanced to
      the banks and sources of the Euphrates and Tigris: 92 the long
      disputed barrier of Rome and Persia was forever confounded; the
      walls of Edessa and Amida, of Dara and Nisibis, which had
      resisted the arms and engines of Sapor or Nushirvan, were
      levelled in the dust; and the holy city of Abgarus might vainly
      produce the epistle or the image of Christ to an unbelieving
      conqueror. To the west the Syrian kingdom is bounded by the sea:
      and the ruin of Aradus, a small island or peninsula on the coast,
      was postponed during ten years. But the hills of Libanus abounded
      in timber; the trade of Phoenicia was populous in mariners; and a
      fleet of seventeen hundred barks was equipped and manned by the
      natives of the desert. The Imperial navy of the Romans fled
      before them from the Pamphylian rocks to the Hellespont; but the
      spirit of the emperor, a grandson of Heraclius, had been subdued
      before the combat by a dream and a pun. 93 The Saracens rode
      masters of the sea; and the islands of Cyprus, Rhodes, and the
      Cyclades, were successively exposed to their rapacious visits.
      Three hundred years before the Christian aera, the memorable
      though fruitless siege of Rhodes 94 by Demetrius had furnished
      that maritime republic with the materials and the subject of a
      trophy. A gigantic statue of Apollo, or the sun, seventy cubits
      in height, was erected at the entrance of the harbor, a monument
      of the freedom and the arts of Greece. After standing fifty-six
      years, the colossus of Rhodes was overthrown by an earthquake;
      but the massy trunk, and huge fragments, lay scattered eight
      centuries on the ground, and are often described as one of the
      wonders of the ancient world. They were collected by the
      diligence of the Saracens, and sold to a Jewish merchant of
      Edessa, who is said to have laden nine hundred camels with the
      weight of the brass metal; an enormous weight, though we should
      include the hundred colossal figures, 95 and the three thousand
      statues, which adorned the prosperity of the city of the sun.

      III. The conquest of Egypt may be explained by the character of
      the victorious Saracen, one of the first of his nation, in an age
      when the meanest of the brethren was exalted above his nature by
      the spirit of enthusiasm. The birth of Amrou was at once base and
      illustrious; his mother, a notorious prostitute, was unable to
      decide among five of the Koreish; but the proof of resemblance
      adjudged the child to Aasi, the oldest of her lovers. 96 The
      youth of Amrou was impelled by the passions and prejudices of his
      kindred: his poetic genius was exercised in satirical verses
      against the person and doctrine of Mahomet; his dexterity was
      employed by the reigning faction to pursue the religious exiles
      who had taken refuge in the court of the Aethiopian king. 97 Yet
      he returned from this embassy a secret proselyte; his reason or
      his interest determined him to renounce the worship of idols; he
      escaped from Mecca with his friend Caled; and the prophet of
      Medina enjoyed at the same moment the satisfaction of embracing
      the two firmest champions of his cause. The impatience of Amrou
      to lead the armies of the faithful was checked by the reproof of
      Omar, who advised him not to seek power and dominion, since he
      who is a subject to-day, may be a prince to-morrow. Yet his merit
      was not overlooked by the two first successors of Mahomet; they
      were indebted to his arms for the conquest of Palestine; and in
      all the battles and sieges of Syria, he united with the temper of
      a chief the valor of an adventurous soldier. In a visit to
      Medina, the caliph expressed a wish to survey the sword which had
      cut down so many Christian warriors; the son of Aasi unsheathed a
      short and ordinary cimeter; and as he perceived the surprise of
      Omar, “Alas,” said the modest Saracen, “the sword itself, without
      the arm of its master, is neither sharper nor more weighty than
      the sword of Pharezdak the poet.” 98 After the conquest of Egypt,
      he was recalled by the jealousy of the caliph Othman; but in the
      subsequent troubles, the ambition of a soldier, a statesman, and
      an orator, emerged from a private station. His powerful support,
      both in council and in the field, established the throne of the
      Ommiades; the administration and revenue of Egypt were restored
      by the gratitude of Moawiyah to a faithful friend who had raised
      himself above the rank of a subject; and Amrou ended his days in
      the palace and city which he had founded on the banks of the
      Nile. His dying speech to his children is celebrated by the
      Arabians as a model of eloquence and wisdom: he deplored the
      errors of his youth but if the penitent was still infected by the
      vanity of a poet, he might exaggerate the venom and mischief of
      his impious compositions. 99

      96 (return) [ We learn this anecdote from a spirited old woman,
      who reviled to their faces, the caliph and his friend. She was

      p. 131, 132.) The readers of Tacitus may aptly compare Vespasian
      and Mucianus with Moawiyah and Amrou. Yet the resemblance is
      still more in the situation, than in the characters, of the men.]

      From his camp in Palestine, Amrou had surprised or anticipated
      the caliph’s leave for the invasion of Egypt. 100 The magnanimous
      Omar trusted in his God and his sword, which had shaken the
      thrones of Chosroes and Caesar: but when he compared the slender
      force of the Moslems with the greatness of the enterprise, he
      condemned his own rashness, and listened to his timid companions.
      The pride and the greatness of Pharaoh were familiar to the
      readers of the Koran; and a tenfold repetition of prodigies had
      been scarcely sufficient to effect, not the victory, but the
      flight, of six hundred thousand of the children of Israel: the
      cities of Egypt were many and populous; their architecture was
      strong and solid; the Nile, with its numerous branches, was alone
      an insuperable barrier; and the granary of the Imperial city
      would be obstinately defended by the Roman powers. In this
      perplexity, the commander of the faithful resigned himself to the
      decision of chance, or, in his opinion, of Providence. At the
      head of only four thousand Arabs, the intrepid Amrou had marched
      away from his station of Gaza when he was overtaken by the
      messenger of Omar. “If you are still in Syria,” said the
      ambiguous mandate, “retreat without delay; but if, at the receipt
      of this epistle, you have already reached the frontiers of Egypt,
      advance with confidence, and depend on the succor of God and of
      your brethren.” The experience, perhaps the secret intelligence,
      of Amrou had taught him to suspect the mutability of courts; and
      he continued his march till his tents were unquestionably pitched
      on Egyptian ground. He there assembled his officers, broke the
      seal, perused the epistle, gravely inquired the name and
      situation of the place, and declared his ready obedience to the
      commands of the caliph. After a siege of thirty days, he took
      possession of Farmah or Pelusium; and that key of Egypt, as it
      has been justly named, unlocked the entrance of the country as
      far as the ruins of Heliopolis and the neighborhood of the modern
      Cairo.

      100 (return) [ Al Wakidi had likewise composed a separate history
      of the conquest of Egypt, which Mr. Ockley could never procure;
      and his own inquiries (vol. i. 344-362) have added very little to
      the original text of Eutychius, (Annal. tom. ii. p. 296-323,
      vers. Pocock,) the Melchite patriarch of Alexandria, who lived
      three hundred years after the revolution.]

      On the Western side of the Nile, at a small distance to the east
      of the Pyramids, at a small distance to the south of the Delta,
      Memphis, one hundred and fifty furlongs in circumference,
      displayed the magnificence of ancient kings. Under the reign of
      the Ptolemies and Caesars, the seat of government was removed to
      the sea-coast; the ancient capital was eclipsed by the arts and
      opulence of Alexandria; the palaces, and at length the temples,
      were reduced to a desolate and ruinous condition: yet, in the age
      of Augustus, and even in that of Constantine, Memphis was still
      numbered among the greatest and most populous of the provincial
      cities. 101 The banks of the Nile, in this place of the breadth
      of three thousand feet, were united by two bridges of sixty and
      of thirty boats, connected in the middle stream by the small
      island of Rouda, which was covered with gardens and habitations.
      102 The eastern extremity of the bridge was terminated by the
      town of Babylon and the camp of a Roman legion, which protected
      the passage of the river and the second capital of Egypt. This
      important fortress, which might fairly be described as a part of
      Memphis or Misrah, was invested by the arms of the lieutenant of
      Omar: a reenforcement of four thousand Saracens soon arrived in
      his camp; and the military engines, which battered the walls, may
      be imputed to the art and labor of his Syrian allies. Yet the
      siege was protracted to seven months; and the rash invaders were
      encompassed and threatened by the inundation of the Nile. 103
      Their last assault was bold and successful: they passed the
      ditch, which had been fortified with iron spikes, applied their
      scaling ladders, entered the fortress with the shout of “God is
      victorious!” and drove the remnant of the Greeks to their boats
      and the Isle of Rouda. The spot was afterwards recommended to the
      conqueror by the easy communication with the gulf and the
      peninsula of Arabia; the remains of Memphis were deserted; the
      tents of the Arabs were converted into permanent habitations; and
      the first mosch was blessed by the presence of fourscore
      companions of Mahomet. 104 A new city arose in their camp, on the
      eastward bank of the Nile; and the contiguous quarters of Babylon
      and Fostat are confounded in their present decay by the
      appellation of old Misrah, or Cairo, of which they form an
      extensive suburb. But the name of Cairo, the town of victory,
      more strictly belongs to the modern capital, which was founded in
      the tenth century by the Fatimite caliphs. 105 It has gradually
      receded from the river; but the continuity of buildings may be
      traced by an attentive eye from the monuments of Sesostris to
      those of Saladin. 106

      opposite the Old Cairo, (Sicard, Nouveaux Memoires des Missions

      77-106,) and above all, of D’Anville, (Description de l’Egypte,
      p. 111, 112, 130-149,) who have removed Memphis towards the
      village of Mohannah, some miles farther to the south. In their
      heat, the disputants have forgot that the ample space of a
      metropolis covers and annihilates the far greater part of the
      controversy.]

      Yet the Arabs, after a glorious and profitable enterprise, must
      have retreated to the desert, had they not found a powerful
      alliance in the heart of the country. The rapid conquest of
      Alexander was assisted by the superstition and revolt of the
      natives: they abhorred their Persian oppressors, the disciples of
      the Magi, who had burnt the temples of Egypt, and feasted with
      sacrilegious appetite on the flesh of the god Apis. 107 After a
      period of ten centuries, the same revolution was renewed by a
      similar cause; and in the support of an incomprehensible creed,
      the zeal of the Coptic Christians was equally ardent. I have
      already explained the origin and progress of the Monophysite
      controversy, and the persecution of the emperors, which converted
      a sect into a nation, and alienated Egypt from their religion and
      government. The Saracens were received as the deliverers of the
      Jacobite church; and a secret and effectual treaty was opened
      during the siege of Memphis between a victorious army and a
      people of slaves. A rich and noble Egyptian, of the name of
      Mokawkas, had dissembled his faith to obtain the administration
      of his province: in the disorders of the Persian war he aspired
      to independence: the embassy of Mahomet ranked him among princes;
      but he declined, with rich gifts and ambiguous compliments, the
      proposal of a new religion. 108 The abuse of his trust exposed
      him to the resentment of Heraclius: his submission was delayed by
      arrogance and fear; and his conscience was prompted by interest
      to throw himself on the favor of the nation and the support of
      the Saracens. In his first conference with Amrou, he heard
      without indignation the usual option of the Koran, the tribute,
      or the sword. “The Greeks,” replied Mokawkas, “are determined to
      abide the determination of the sword; but with the Greeks I
      desire no communion, either in this world or in the next, and I
      abjure forever the Byzantine tyrant, his synod of Chalcedon, and
      his Melchite slaves. For myself and my brethren, we are resolved
      to live and die in the profession of the gospel and unity of
      Christ. It is impossible for us to embrace the revelations of
      your prophet; but we are desirous of peace, and cheerfully submit
      to pay tribute and obedience to his temporal successors.” The
      tribute was ascertained at two pieces of gold for the head of
      every Christian; but old men, monks, women, and children, of both
      sexes, under sixteen years of age, were exempted from this
      personal assessment: the Copts above and below Memphis swore
      allegiance to the caliph, and promised a hospitable entertainment
      of three days to every Mussulman who should travel through their
      country. By this charter of security, the ecclesiastical and
      civil tyranny of the Melchites was destroyed: 109 the anathemas
      of St. Cyril were thundered from every pulpit; and the sacred
      edifices, with the patrimony of the church, were restored to the
      national communion of the Jacobites, who enjoyed without
      moderation the moment of triumph and revenge. At the pressing
      summons of Amrou, their patriarch Benjamin emerged from his
      desert; and after the first interview, the courteous Arab
      affected to declare that he had never conversed with a Christian
      priest of more innocent manners and a more venerable aspect. 110
      In the march from Memphis to Alexandria, the lieutenant of Omar
      intrusted his safety to the zeal and gratitude of the Egyptians:
      the roads and bridges were diligently repaired; and in every step
      of his progress, he could depend on a constant supply of
      provisions and intelligence. The Greeks of Egypt, whose numbers
      could scarcely equal a tenth of the natives, were overwhelmed by
      the universal defection: they had ever been hated, they were no
      longer feared: the magistrate fled from his tribunal, the bishop
      from his altar; and the distant garrisons were surprised or
      starved by the surrounding multitudes. Had not the Nile afforded
      a safe and ready conveyance to the sea, not an individual could
      have escaped, who by birth, or language, or office, or religion,
      was connected with their odious name.

      of Egypt with some facts from the Arabic text of Severus the
      Jacobite historian]

      By the retreat of the Greeks from the provinces of Upper Egypt, a
      considerable force was collected in the Island of Delta; the
      natural and artificial channels of the Nile afforded a succession
      of strong and defensible posts; and the road to Alexandria was
      laboriously cleared by the victory of the Saracens in
      two-and-twenty days of general or partial combat. In their annals
      of conquest, the siege of Alexandria 111 is perhaps the most
      arduous and important enterprise. The first trading city in the
      world was abundantly replenished with the means of subsistence
      and defence. Her numerous inhabitants fought for the dearest of
      human rights, religion and property; and the enmity of the
      natives seemed to exclude them from the common benefit of peace
      and toleration. The sea was continually open; and if Heraclius
      had been awake to the public distress, fresh armies of Romans and
      Barbarians might have been poured into the harbor to save the
      second capital of the empire. A circumference of ten miles would
      have scattered the forces of the Greeks, and favored the
      stratagems of an active enemy; but the two sides of an oblong
      square were covered by the sea and the Lake Maraeotis, and each
      of the narrow ends exposed a front of no more than ten furlongs.
      The efforts of the Arabs were not inadequate to the difficulty of
      the attempt and the value of the prize. From the throne of
      Medina, the eyes of Omar were fixed on the camp and city: his
      voice excited to arms the Arabian tribes and the veterans of
      Syria; and the merit of a holy war was recommended by the
      peculiar fame and fertility of Egypt. Anxious for the ruin or
      expulsion of their tyrants, the faithful natives devoted their
      labors to the service of Amrou: some sparks of martial spirit
      were perhaps rekindled by the example of their allies; and the
      sanguine hopes of Mokawkas had fixed his sepulchre in the church
      of St. John of Alexandria. Eutychius the patriarch observes, that
      the Saracens fought with the courage of lions: they repulsed the
      frequent and almost daily sallies of the besieged, and soon
      assaulted in their turn the walls and towers of the city. In
      every attack, the sword, the banner of Amrou, glittered in the
      van of the Moslems. On a memorable day, he was betrayed by his
      imprudent valor: his followers who had entered the citadel were
      driven back; and the general, with a friend and slave, remained a
      prisoner in the hands of the Christians. When Amrou was conducted
      before the praefect, he remembered his dignity, and forgot his
      situation: a lofty demeanor, and resolute language, revealed the
      lieutenant of the caliph, and the battle-axe of a soldier was
      already raised to strike off the head of the audacious captive.
      His life was saved by the readiness of his slave, who instantly
      gave his master a blow on the face, and commanded him, with an
      angry tone, to be silent in the presence of his superiors. The
      credulous Greek was deceived: he listened to the offer of a
      treaty, and his prisoners were dismissed in the hope of a more
      respectable embassy, till the joyful acclamations of the camp
      announced the return of their general, and insulted the folly of
      the infidels. At length, after a siege of fourteen months, 112
      and the loss of three-and-twenty thousand men, the Saracens
      prevailed: the Greeks embarked their dispirited and diminished
      numbers, and the standard of Mahomet was planted on the walls of
      the capital of Egypt. “I have taken,” said Amrou to the caliph,
      “the great city of the West. It is impossible for me to enumerate
      the variety of its riches and beauty; and I shall content myself
      with observing, that it contains four thousand palaces, four
      thousand baths, four hundred theatres or places of amusement,
      twelve thousand shops for the sale of vegetable food, and forty
      thousand tributary Jews. The town has been subdued by force of
      arms, without treaty or capitulation, and the Moslems are
      impatient to seize the fruits of their victory.” 113 The
      commander of the faithful rejected with firmness the idea of
      pillage, and directed his lieutenant to reserve the wealth and
      revenue of Alexandria for the public service and the propagation
      of the faith: the inhabitants were numbered; a tribute was
      imposed, the zeal and resentment of the Jacobites were curbed,
      and the Melchites who submitted to the Arabian yoke were indulged
      in the obscure but tranquil exercise of their worship. The
      intelligence of this disgraceful and calamitous event afflicted
      the declining health of the emperor; and Heraclius died of a
      dropsy about seven weeks after the loss of Alexandria. 114 Under
      the minority of his grandson, the clamors of a people, deprived
      of their daily sustenance, compelled the Byzantine court to
      undertake the recovery of the capital of Egypt. In the space of
      four years, the harbor and fortifications of Alexandria were
      twice occupied by a fleet and army of Romans. They were twice
      expelled by the valor of Amrou, who was recalled by the domestic
      peril from the distant wars of Tripoli and Nubia. But the
      facility of the attempt, the repetition of the insult, and the
      obstinacy of the resistance, provoked him to swear, that if a
      third time he drove the infidels into the sea, he would render
      Alexandria as accessible on all sides as the house of a
      prostitute. Faithful to his promise, he dismantled several parts
      of the walls and towers; but the people was spared in the
      chastisement of the city, and the mosch of Mercy was erected on
      the spot where the victorious general had stopped the fury of his
      troops.

      Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs.—Part VI.

      I should deceive the expectation of the reader, if I passed in
      silence the fate of the Alexandrian library, as it is described
      by the learned Abulpharagius. The spirit of Amrou was more
      curious and liberal than that of his brethren, and in his leisure
      hours, the Arabian chief was pleased with the conversation of
      John, the last disciple of Ammonius, and who derived the surname
      of Philoponus from his laborious studies of grammar and
      philosophy. 115 Emboldened by this familiar intercourse,
      Philoponus presumed to solicit a gift, inestimable in his
      opinion, contemptible in that of the Barbarians—the royal
      library, which alone, among the spoils of Alexandria, had not
      been appropriated by the visit and the seal of the conqueror.

      Amrou was inclined to gratify the wish of the grammarian, but his
      rigid integrity refused to alienate the minutest object without
      the consent of the caliph; and the well-known answer of Omar was
      inspired by the ignorance of a fanatic. “If these writings of the
      Greeks agree with the book of God, they are useless, and need not
      be preserved: if they disagree, they are pernicious, and ought to
      be destroyed.” The sentence was executed with blind obedience:
      the volumes of paper or parchment were distributed to the four
      thousand baths of the city; and such was their incredible
      multitude, that six months were barely sufficient for the
      consumption of this precious fuel. Since the Dynasties of
      Abulpharagius 116 have been given to the world in a Latin
      version, the tale has been repeatedly transcribed; and every
      scholar, with pious indignation, has deplored the irreparable
      shipwreck of the learning, the arts, and the genius, of
      antiquity. For my own part, I am strongly tempted to deny both
      the fact and the consequences. 1161 The fact is indeed
      marvellous. “Read and wonder!” says the historian himself: and
      the solitary report of a stranger who wrote at the end of six
      hundred years on the confines of Media, is overbalanced by the
      silence of two annalist of a more early date, both Christians,
      both natives of Egypt, and the most ancient of whom, the
      patriarch Eutychius, has amply described the conquest of
      Alexandria. 117 The rigid sentence of Omar is repugnant to the
      sound and orthodox precept of the Mahometan casuists they
      expressly declare, that the religious books of the Jews and
      Christians, which are acquired by the right of war, should never
      be committed to the flames; and that the works of profane
      science, historians or poets, physicians or philosophers, may be
      lawfully applied to the use of the faithful. 118 A more
      destructive zeal may perhaps be attributed to the first
      successors of Mahomet; yet in this instance, the conflagration
      would have speedily expired in the deficiency of materials. I
      should not recapitulate the disasters of the Alexandrian library,
      the involuntary flame that was kindled by Caesar in his own
      defence, 119 or the mischievous bigotry of the Christians, who
      studied to destroy the monuments of idolatry. 120 But if we
      gradually descend from the age of the Antonines to that of
      Theodosius, we shall learn from a chain of contemporary
      witnesses, that the royal palace and the temple of Serapis no
      longer contained the four, or the seven, hundred thousand
      volumes, which had been assembled by the curiosity and
      magnificence of the Ptolemies. 121 Perhaps the church and seat of
      the patriarchs might be enriched with a repository of books; but
      if the ponderous mass of Arian and Monophysite controversy were
      indeed consumed in the public baths, 122 a philosopher may allow,
      with a smile, that it was ultimately devoted to the benefit of
      mankind. I sincerely regret the more valuable libraries which
      have been involved in the ruin of the Roman empire; but when I
      seriously compute the lapse of ages, the waste of ignorance, and
      the calamities of war, our treasures, rather than our losses, are
      the objects of my surprise. Many curious and interesting facts
      are buried in oblivion: the three great historians of Rome have
      been transmitted to our hands in a mutilated state, and we are
      deprived of many pleasing compositions of the lyric, iambic, and
      dramatic poetry of the Greeks. Yet we should gratefully remember,
      that the mischances of time and accident have spared the classic
      works to which the suffrage of antiquity 123 had adjudged the
      first place of genius and glory: the teachers of ancient
      knowledge, who are still extant, had perused and compared the
      writings of their predecessors; 124 nor can it fairly be presumed
      that any important truth, any useful discovery in art or nature,
      has been snatched away from the curiosity of modern ages.

      by the command of Omar, beyond question. Compare St. Martin’s

      against the Crusaders. The library of Tripoli is said to have
      contained the incredible number of three millions of volumes. On
      the capture of the city, Count Bertram of St. Giles, entering the
      first room, which contained nothing but the Koran, ordered the
      whole to be burnt, as the works of the false prophet of Arabia.

      Barbaric science would scarcely admit the Indian or Aethiopic
      books into the library of Alexandria; nor is it proved that

      In the administration of Egypt, 125 Amrou balanced the demands of
      justice and policy; the interest of the people of the law, who
      were defended by God; and of the people of the alliance, who were
      protected by man. In the recent tumult of conquest and
      deliverance, the tongue of the Copts and the sword of the Arabs
      were most adverse to the tranquillity of the province. To the
      former, Amrou declared, that faction and falsehood would be
      doubly chastised; by the punishment of the accusers, whom he
      should detest as his personal enemies, and by the promotion of
      their innocent brethren, whom their envy had labored to injure
      and supplant. He excited the latter by the motives of religion
      and honor to sustain the dignity of their character, to endear
      themselves by a modest and temperate conduct to God and the
      caliph, to spare and protect a people who had trusted to their
      faith, and to content themselves with the legitimate and splendid
      rewards of their victory. In the management of the revenue, he
      disapproved the simple but oppressive mode of a capitation, and
      preferred with reason a proportion of taxes deducted on every
      branch from the clear profits of agriculture and commerce. A
      third part of the tribute was appropriated to the annual repairs
      of the dikes and canals, so essential to the public welfare.
      Under his administration, the fertility of Egypt supplied the
      dearth of Arabia; and a string of camels, laden with corn and
      provisions, covered almost without an interval the long road from
      Memphis to Medina. 126 But the genius of Amrou soon renewed the
      maritime communication which had been attempted or achieved by
      the Pharaohs the Ptolemies, or the Caesars; and a canal, at least
      eighty miles in length, was opened from the Nile to the Red Sea.
      1261 This inland navigation, which would have joined the
      Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, was soon discontinued as
      useless and dangerous: the throne was removed from Medina to
      Damascus, and the Grecian fleets might have explored a passage to
      the holy cities of Arabia. 127

      125 (return) [ This curious and authentic intelligence of Murtadi

      1261 (return) [ Many learned men have doubted the existence of a
      communication by water between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean
      by the Nile. Yet the fact is positively asserted by the ancients.
      Diodorus Siculus (l. i. p. 33) speaks of it in the most distinct
      manner as existing in his time. So, also, Strabo, (l. xvii. p.
      805.) Pliny (vol. vi. p. 29) says that the canal which united the
      two seas was navigable, (alveus navigabilis.) The indications
      furnished by Ptolemy and by the Arabic historian, Makrisi, show
      that works were executed under the reign of Hadrian to repair the
      canal and extend the navigation; it then received the name of the
      River of Trajan Lucian, (in his Pseudomantis, p. 44,) says that
      he went by water from Alexandria to Clysma, on the Red Sea.
      Testimonies of the 6th and of the 8th century show that the
      communication was not interrupted at that time. See the French
      translation of Strabo, vol. v. p. 382. St. Martin vol. xi. p.
      299.—M.]

      127 (return) [ On these obscure canals, the reader may try to
      satisfy himself from D’Anville, (Mem. sur l’Egypte, p. 108-110,
      124, 132,) and a learned thesis, maintained and printed at
      Strasburg in the year 1770, (Jungendorum marium fluviorumque
      molimina, p. 39-47, 68-70.) Even the supine Turks have agitated
      the old project of joining the two seas. (Memoires du Baron de
      Tott, tom. iv.)]

      Of his new conquest, the caliph Omar had an imperfect knowledge
      from the voice of fame and the legends of the Koran. He requested
      that his lieutenant would place before his eyes the realm of
      Pharaoh and the Amalekites; and the answer of Amrou exhibits a
      lively and not unfaithful picture of that singular country. 128
      “O commander of the faithful, Egypt is a compound of black earth
      and green plants, between a pulverized mountain and a red sand.
      The distance from Syene to the sea is a month’s journey for a
      horseman. Along the valley descends a river, on which the
      blessing of the Most High reposes both in the evening and
      morning, and which rises and falls with the revolutions of the
      sun and moon. When the annual dispensation of Providence unlocks
      the springs and fountains that nourish the earth, the Nile rolls
      his swelling and sounding waters through the realm of Egypt: the
      fields are overspread by the salutary flood; and the villages
      communicate with each other in their painted barks. The retreat
      of the inundation deposits a fertilizing mud for the reception of
      the various seeds: the crowds of husbandmen who blacken the land
      may be compared to a swarm of industrious ants; and their native
      indolence is quickened by the lash of the task-master, and the
      promise of the flowers and fruits of a plentiful increase. Their
      hope is seldom deceived; but the riches which they extract from
      the wheat, the barley, and the rice, the legumes, the
      fruit-trees, and the cattle, are unequally shared between those
      who labor and those who possess. According to the vicissitudes of
      the seasons, the face of the country is adorned with a silver
      wave, a verdant emerald, and the deep yellow of a golden
      harvest.” 129 Yet this beneficial order is sometimes interrupted;
      and the long delay and sudden swell of the river in the first
      year of the conquest might afford some color to an edifying
      fable. It is said, that the annual sacrifice of a virgin 130 had
      been interdicted by the piety of Omar; and that the Nile lay
      sullen and inactive in his shallow bed, till the mandate of the
      caliph was cast into the obedient stream, which rose in a single
      night to the height of sixteen cubits. The admiration of the
      Arabs for their new conquest encouraged the license of their
      romantic spirit. We may read, in the gravest authors, that Egypt
      was crowded with twenty thousand cities or villages: 131 that,
      exclusive of the Greeks and Arabs, the Copts alone were found, on
      the assessment, six millions of tributary subjects, 132 or twenty
      millions of either sex, and of every age: that three hundred
      millions of gold or silver were annually paid to the treasury of
      the caliphs. 133 Our reason must be startled by these extravagant
      assertions; and they will become more palpable, if we assume the
      compass and measure the extent of habitable ground: a valley from
      the tropic to Memphis seldom broader than twelve miles, and the
      triangle of the Delta, a flat surface of two thousand one hundred
      square leagues, compose a twelfth part of the magnitude of
      France. 134 A more accurate research will justify a more
      reasonable estimate. The three hundred millions, created by the
      error of a scribe, are reduced to the decent revenue of four
      millions three hundred thousand pieces of gold, of which nine
      hundred thousand were consumed by the pay of the soldiers. 135
      Two authentic lists, of the present and of the twelfth century,
      are circumscribed within the respectable number of two thousand
      seven hundred villages and towns. 136 After a long residence at
      Cairo, a French consul has ventured to assign about four millions
      of Mahometans, Christians, and Jews, for the ample, though not
      incredible, scope of the population of Egypt. 137

      IV. The conquest of Africa, from the Nile to the Atlantic Ocean,
      138 was first attempted by the arms of the caliph Othman.

      The pious design was approved by the companions of Mahomet and
      the chiefs of the tribes; and twenty thousand Arabs marched from
      Medina, with the gifts and the blessing of the commander of the
      faithful. They were joined in the camp of Memphis by twenty
      thousand of their countrymen; and the conduct of the war was
      intrusted to Abdallah, 139 the son of Said and the foster-brother
      of the caliph, who had lately supplanted the conqueror and
      lieutenant of Egypt. Yet the favor of the prince, and the merit
      of his favorite, could not obliterate the guilt of his apostasy.
      The early conversion of Abdallah, and his skilful pen, had
      recommended him to the important office of transcribing the
      sheets of the Koran: he betrayed his trust, corrupted the text,
      derided the errors which he had made, and fled to Mecca to escape
      the justice, and expose the ignorance, of the apostle. After the
      conquest of Mecca, he fell prostrate at the feet of Mahomet; his
      tears, and the entreaties of Othman, extorted a reluctant pardon;
      but the prophet declared that he had so long hesitated, to allow
      time for some zealous disciple to avenge his injury in the blood
      of the apostate. With apparent fidelity and effective merit, he
      served the religion which it was no longer his interest to
      desert: his birth and talents gave him an honorable rank among
      the Koreish; and, in a nation of cavalry, Abdallah was renowned
      as the boldest and most dexterous horseman of Arabia. At the head
      of forty thousand Moslems, he advanced from Egypt into the
      unknown countries of the West. The sands of Barca might be
      impervious to a Roman legion but the Arabs were attended by their
      faithful camels; and the natives of the desert beheld without
      terror the familiar aspect of the soil and climate. After a
      painful march, they pitched their tents before the walls of
      Tripoli, 140 a maritime city in which the name, the wealth, and
      the inhabitants of the province had gradually centred, and which
      now maintains the third rank among the states of Barbary. A
      reenforcement of Greeks was surprised and cut in pieces on the
      sea-shore; but the fortifications of Tripoli resisted the first
      assaults; and the Saracens were tempted by the approach of the
      praefect Gregory 141 to relinquish the labors of the siege for
      the perils and the hopes of a decisive action. If his standard
      was followed by one hundred and twenty thousand men, the regular
      bands of the empire must have been lost in the naked and
      disorderly crowd of Africans and Moors, who formed the strength,
      or rather the numbers, of his host. He rejected with indignation
      the option of the Koran or the tribute; and during several days
      the two armies were fiercely engaged from the dawn of light to
      the hour of noon, when their fatigue and the excessive heat
      compelled them to seek shelter and refreshment in their
      respective camps. The daughter of Gregory, a maid of incomparable
      beauty and spirit, is said to have fought by his side: from her
      earliest youth she was trained to mount on horseback, to draw the
      bow, and to wield the cimeter; and the richness of her arms and
      apparel were conspicuous in the foremost ranks of the battle. Her
      hand, with a hundred thousand pieces of gold, was offered for the
      head of the Arabian general, and the youths of Africa were
      excited by the prospect of the glorious prize. At the pressing
      solicitation of his brethren, Abdallah withdrew his person from
      the field; but the Saracens were discouraged by the retreat of
      their leader, and the repetition of these equal or unsuccessful
      conflicts.

      had probably assumed the purple, (Chronograph. p. 285.)]

      A noble Arabian, who afterwards became the adversary of Ali, and
      the father of a caliph, had signalized his valor in Egypt, and
      Zobeir 142 was the first who planted the scaling-ladder against
      the walls of Babylon. In the African war he was detached from the
      standard of Abdallah. On the news of the battle, Zobeir, with
      twelve companions, cut his way through the camp of the Greeks,
      and pressed forwards, without tasting either food or repose, to
      partake of the dangers of his brethren. He cast his eyes round
      the field: “Where,” said he, “is our general?” “In his tent.” “Is
      the tent a station for the general of the Moslems?” Abdallah
      represented with a blush the importance of his own life, and the
      temptation that was held forth by the Roman praefect. “Retort,”
      said Zobeir, “on the infidels their ungenerous attempt. Proclaim
      through the ranks that the head of Gregory shall be repaid with
      his captive daughter, and the equal sum of one hundred thousand
      pieces of gold.” To the courage and discretion of Zobeir the
      lieutenant of the caliph intrusted the execution of his own
      stratagem, which inclined the long-disputed balance in favor of
      the Saracens. Supplying by activity and artifice the deficiency
      of numbers, a part of their forces lay concealed in their tents,
      while the remainder prolonged an irregular skirmish with the
      enemy till the sun was high in the heavens. On both sides they
      retired with fainting steps: their horses were unbridled, their
      armor was laid aside, and the hostile nations prepared, or seemed
      to prepare, for the refreshment of the evening, and the encounter
      of the ensuing day. On a sudden the charge was sounded; the
      Arabian camp poured forth a swarm of fresh and intrepid warriors;
      and the long line of the Greeks and Africans was surprised,
      assaulted, overturned, by new squadrons of the faithful, who, to
      the eye of fanaticism, might appear as a band of angels
      descending from the sky. The praefect himself was slain by the
      hand of Zobeir: his daughter, who sought revenge and death, was
      surrounded and made prisoner; and the fugitives involved in their
      disaster the town of Sufetula, to which they escaped from the
      sabres and lances of the Arabs. Sufetula was built one hundred
      and fifty miles to the south of Carthage: a gentle declivity is
      watered by a running stream, and shaded by a grove of
      juniper-trees; and, in the ruins of a triumpha arch, a portico,
      and three temples of the Corinthian order, curiosity may yet
      admire the magnificence of the Romans. 143 After the fall of this
      opulent city, the provincials and Barbarians implored on all
      sides the mercy of the conqueror. His vanity or his zeal might be
      flattered by offers of tribute or professions of faith: but his
      losses, his fatigues, and the progress of an epidemical disease,
      prevented a solid establishment; and the Saracens, after a
      campaign of fifteen months, retreated to the confines of Egypt,
      with the captives and the wealth of their African expedition. The
      caliph’s fifth was granted to a favorite, on the nominal payment
      of five hundred thousand pieces of gold; 144 but the state was
      doubly injured by this fallacious transaction, if each
      foot-soldier had shared one thousand, and each horseman three
      thousand, pieces, in the real division of the plunder. The author
      of the death of Gregory was expected to have claimed the most
      precious reward of the victory: from his silence it might be
      presumed that he had fallen in the battle, till the tears and
      exclamations of the praefect’s daughter at the sight of Zobeir
      revealed the valor and modesty of that gallant soldier. The
      unfortunate virgin was offered, and almost rejected as a slave,
      by her father’s murderer, who coolly declared that his sword was
      consecrated to the service of religion; and that he labored for a
      recompense far above the charms of mortal beauty, or the riches
      of this transitory life. A reward congenial to his temper was the
      honorable commission of announcing to the caliph Othman the
      success of his arms. The companions the chiefs, and the people,
      were assembled in the mosch of Medina, to hear the interesting
      narrative of Zobeir; and as the orator forgot nothing except the
      merit of his own counsels and actions, the name of Abdallah was
      joined by the Arabians with the heroic names of Caled and Amrou.

      [A. D. 665-689.] The western conquests of the Saracens were
      suspended near twenty years, till their dissensions were composed
      by the establishment of the house of Ommiyah; and the caliph
      Moawiyah was invited by the cries of the Africans themselves. The
      successors of Heraclius had been informed of the tribute which
      they had been compelled to stipulate with the Arabs; but instead
      of being moved to pity and relieve their distress, they imposed,
      as an equivalent or a fine, a second tribute of a similar amount.
      The ears of the zantine ministers were shut against the
      complaints of their poverty and ruin their despair was reduced to
      prefer the dominion of a single master; and the extortions of the
      patriarch of Carthage, who was invested with civil and military
      power, provoked the sectaries, and even the Catholics, of the
      Roman province to abjure the religion as well as the authority of
      their tyrants. The first lieutenant of Moawiyah acquired a just
      renown, subdued an important city, defeated an army of thirty
      thousand Greeks, swept away fourscore thousand captives, and
      enriched with their spoils the bold adventurers of Syria and
      Egypt.146 But the title of conqueror of Africa is more justly due
      to his successor Akbah. He marched from Damascus at the head of
      ten thousand of the bravest Arabs; and the genuine force of the
      Moslems was enlarged by the doubtful aid and conversion of many
      thousand Barbarians. It would be difficult, nor is it necessary,
      to trace the accurate line of the progress of Akbah. The interior
      regions have been peopled by the Orientals with fictitious armies
      and imaginary citadels. In the warlike province of Zab or
      Numidia, fourscore thousand of the natives might assemble in
      arms; but the number of three hundred and sixty towns is
      incompatible with the ignorance or decay of husbandry;147 and a
      circumference of three leagues will not be justified by the ruins
      of Erbe or Lambesa, the ancient metropolis of that inland
      country. As we approach the seacoast, the well-known titles of
      Bugia,148 and Tangier149 define the more certain limits of the
      Saracen victories. A remnant of trade still adheres to the
      commodious harbour of Bugia, which, in a more prosperous age, is
      said to have contained about twenty thousand houses; and the
      plenty of iron which is dug from the adjacent mountains might
      have supplied a braver people with the instruments of defence.
      The remote position and venerable antiquity of Tingi, or Tangier,
      have been decorated by the Greek and Arabian fables; but the
      figurative expressions of the latter, that the walls were
      constructed of brass, and that the roofs were covered with gold
      and silver, may be interpreted as the emblems of strength and
      opulence.

      The province of Mauritania Tingitana,150 which assumed the name
      of the capital had been imperfectly discovered and settled by the
      Romans; the five colonies were confined to a narrow pale, and the
      more southern parts were seldom explored except by the agents of
      luxury, who searched the forests for ivory and the citron
      wood,151 and the shores of the ocean for the purple shellfish.
      The fearless Akbah plunged into the heart of the country,
      traversed the wilderness in which his successors erected the
      splendid capitals of Fez and Morocco,152 and at length penetrated
      to the verge of the Atlantic and the great desert. The river Suz
      descends from the western sides of mount Atlas, fertilizes, like
      the Nile, the adjacent soil, and falls into the sea at a moderate
      distance from the Canary, or adjacent islands. Its banks were
      inhabited by the last of the Moors, a race of savages, without
      laws, or discipline, or religion: they were astonished by the
      strange and irresistible terrors of the Oriental arms; and as
      they possessed neither gold nor silver, the richest spoil was the
      beauty of the female captives, some of whom were afterward sold
      for a thousand pieces of gold. The career, though not the zeal,
      of Akbah was checked by the prospect of a boundless ocean. He
      spurred his horse into the waves, and raising his eyes to heaven,
      exclaimed with the tone of a fanatic: “Great God! if my course
      were not stopped by this sea, I would still go on, to the unknown
      kingdoms of the West, preaching the unity of thy holy name, and
      putting to the sword the rebellious nations who worship another
      gods than thee.” 153 Yet this Mahometan Alexander, who sighed for
      new worlds, was unable to preserve his recent conquests. By the
      universal defection of the Greeks and Africans he was recalled
      from the shores of the Atlantic, and the surrounding multitudes
      left him only the resource of an honourable death. The last scene
      was dignified by an example of national virtue. An ambitious
      chief, who had disputed the command and failed in the attempt,
      was led about as a prisoner in the camp of the Arabian general.
      The insurgents had trusted to his discontent and revenge; he
      disdained their offers and revealed their designs. In the hour of
      danger, the grateful Akbah unlocked his fetters, and advised him
      to retire; he chose to die under the banner of his rival.
      Embracing as friends and martyrs, they unsheathed their
      scimeters, broke their scabbards, and maintained an obstinate
      combat, till they fell by each other’s side on the last of their
      slaughtered countrymen. The third general or governor of Africa,
      Zuheir, avenged and encountered the fate of his predecessor. He
      vanquished the natives in many battles; he was overthrown by a
      powerful army, which Constantinople had sent to the relief of
      Carthage.

      [A. D. 670-675.] It had been the frequent practice of the Moorish
      tribes to join the invaders, to share the plunder, to profess the
      faith, and to revolt in their savage state of independence and
      idolatry, on the first retreat or misfortune of the Moslems. The
      prudence of Akbah had proposed to found an Arabian colony in the
      heart of Africa; a citadel that might curb the levity of the
      Barbarians, a place of refuge to secure, against the accidents of
      war, the wealth and the families of the Saracens. With this view,
      and under the modest title of the station of a caravan, he
      planted this colony in the fiftieth year of the Hegira. In its
      present decay, Cairoan154 still holds the second rank in the
      kingdom of Tunis, from which it is distant about fifty miles to
      the south;155 its inland situation, twelve miles westward of the
      sea, has protected the city from the Greek and Sicilian fleets.
      When the wild beasts and serpents were extirpated, when the
      forest, or rather wilderness, was cleared, the vestiges of a
      Roman town were discovered in a sandy plain: the vegetable food
      of Cairoan is brought from afar; and the scarcity of springs
      constrains the inhabitants to collect in cisterns and reservoirs
      a precarious supply of rain water. These obstacles were subdued
      by the industry of Akbah; he traced a circumference of three
      thousand and six hundred paces, which he encompassed with a brick
      wall; in the space of five years, the governor’s palace was
      surrounded with a sufficient number of private habitations; a
      spacious mosque was supported by five hundred columns of granite,
      porphyry, and Numidian marble; and Cairoan became the seat of
      learning as well as of empire. But these were the glories of a
      later age; the new colony was shaken by the successive defeats of
      Akbah and Zuheir, and the western expeditions were again
      interrupted by the civil discord of the Arabian monarchy. The son
      of the valiant Zobeir maintained a war of twelve years, a siege
      of seven months against the house of Ommiyah. Abdallah was said
      to unite the fierceness of the lion with the subtlety of the fox;
      but if he inherited the courage, he was devoid of the generosity,
      of his father.156

      [A. D. 692-698.] The return of domestic peace allowed the caliph
      Abdalmalek to resume the conquest of Africa; the standard was
      delivered to Hassan governor of Egypt, and the revenue of that
      kingdom, with an army of forty thousand men, was consecrated to
      the important service. In the vicissitudes of war, the interior
      provinces had been alternately won and lost by the Saracens. But
      the seacoast still remained in the hands of the Greeks; the
      predecessors of Hassan had respected the name and fortifications
      of Carthage; and the number of its defenders was recruited by the
      fugitives of Cabes and Tripoli. The arms of Hassan were bolder
      and more fortunate: he reduced and pillaged the metropolis of
      Africa; and the mention of scaling-ladders may justify the
      suspicion, that he anticipated, by a sudden assault, the more
      tedious operations of a regular siege. But the joy of the
      conquerors was soon disturbed by the appearance of the Christian
      succours. The praefect and patrician John, a general of
      experience and renown, embarked at Constantinople the forces of
      the Eastern empire;157 they were joined by the ships and soldiers
      of Sicily, and a powerful reinforcement of Goths158 was obtained
      from the fears and religion of the Spanish monarch.

      new, is so interesting and so probable, that I will accept it on

      The weight of the confederate navy broke the chain that guarded
      the entrance of the harbour; the Arabs retired to Cairoan, or
      Tripoli; the Christians landed; the citizens hailed the ensign of
      the cross, and the winter was idly wasted in the dream of victory
      or deliverance. But Africa was irrecoverably lost: the zeal and
      resentment of the commander of the faithful159 prepared in the
      ensuing spring a more numerous armament by sea and land; and the
      patrician in his turn was compelled to evacuate the post and
      fortifications of Carthage. A second battle was fought in the
      neighbourhood of Utica; and the Greeks and Goths were again
      defeated; and their timely embarkation saved them from the sword
      of Hassan, who had invested the slight and insufficient rampart
      of their camp. Whatever yet remained of Carthage was delivered to
      the flames, and the colony of Dido160 and Cesar lay desolate
      above two hundred years, till a part, perhaps a twentieth, of the
      old circumference was repeopled by the first of the Fatimite
      caliphs. In the beginning of the sixteenth century, the second
      capital of the West was represented by a mosque, a college
      without students, twenty-five or thirty shops, and the huts of
      five hundred peasants, who, in their abject poverty, displayed
      the arrogance of the Punic senators. Even that paltry village was
      swept away by the Spaniards whom Charles the Fifth had stationed
      in the fortress of the Goletta. The ruins of Carthage have
      perished; and the place might be unknown if some broken arches of
      an aqueduct did not guide the footsteps of the inquisitive
      traveller.161

      [A. D. 698-709.] The Greeks were expelled, but the Arabians were
      not yet masters of the country. In the interior provinces the
      Moors or Berbers,162 so feeble under the first Cesars, so
      formidable to the Byzantine princes, maintained a disorderly
      resistance to the religion and power of the successors of
      Mahomet. Under the standard of their queen Cahina, the
      independent tribes acquired some degree of union and discipline;
      and as the Moors respected in their females the character of a
      prophetess, they attacked the invaders with an enthusiasm similar
      to their own. The veteran bands of Hassan were inadequate to the
      defence of Africa: the conquests of an age were lost in a single
      day; and the Arabian chief, overwhelmed by the torrent, retired
      to the confines of Egypt, and expected, five years, the promised
      succours of the caliph. After the retreat of the Saracens, the
      victorious prophetess assembled the Moorish chiefs, and
      recommended a measure of strange and savage policy. “Our cities,”
      said she, “and the gold and silver which they contain,
      perpetually attract the arms of the Arabs. These vile metals are
      not the objects of OUR ambition; we content ourselves with the
      simple productions of the earth. Let us destroy these cities; let
      us bury in their ruins those pernicious treasures; and when the
      avarice of our foes shall be destitute of temptation, perhaps
      they will cease to disturb the tranquillity of a warlike people.”
      The proposal was accepted with unanimous applause. From Tangier
      to Tripoli the buildings, or at least the fortifications, were
      demolished, the fruit-trees were cut down, the means of
      subsistence were extirpated, a fertile and populous garden was
      changed into a desert, and the historians of a more recent period
      could discern the frequent traces of the prosperity and
      devastation of their ancestors.

      162 (return) [ The history of the word Barbar may be classed
      under four periods, 1. In the time of Homer, when the Greeks and
      Asiatics might probably use a common idiom, the imitative sound
      of Barbar was applied to the ruder tribes, whose pronunciation
      was most harsh, whose grammar was most defective. 2. From the
      time, at least, of Herodotus, it was extended to all the nations
      who were strangers to the language and manners of the Greeks. 3.
      In the age, of Plautus, the Romans submitted to the insult
      (Pompeius Festus, l. ii. p. 48, edit. Dacier), and freely gave
      themselves the name of Barbarians. They insensibly claimed an
      exemption for Italy, and her subject provinces; and at length
      removed the disgraceful appellation to the savage or hostile
      nations beyond the pale of the empire. 4. In every sense, it was
      due to the Moors; the familiar word was borrowed from the Latin
      Provincials by the Arabian conquerors, and has justly settled as
      a local denomination (Barbary) along the northern coast of
      Africa.]

      Such is the tale of the modern Arabians. Yet I strongly suspect
      that their ignorance of antiquity, the love of the marvellous,
      and the fashion of extolling the philosophy of Barbarians, has
      induced them to describe, as one voluntary act, the calamities of
      three hundred years since the first fury of the Donatists and
      Vandals. In the progress of the revolt, Cahina had most probably
      contributed her share of destruction; and the alarm of universal
      ruin might terrify and alienate the cities that had reluctantly
      yielded to her unworthy yoke. They no longer hoped, perhaps they
      no longer wished, the return of their Byzantine sovereigns: their
      present servitude was not alleviated by the benefits of order and
      justice; and the most zealous Catholic must prefer the imperfect
      truths of the Koran to the blind and rude idolatry of the Moors.
      The general of the Saracens was again received as the saviour of
      the province; the friends of civil society conspired against the
      savages of the land; and the royal prophetess was slain in the
      first battle which overturned the baseless fabric of her
      superstition and empire. The same spirit revived under the
      successor of Hassan; it was finally quelled by the activity of
      Musa and his two sons; but the number of the rebels may be
      presumed from that of three hundred thousand captives; sixty
      thousand of whom, the caliph’s fifth, were sold for the profit of
      thee public treasury. Thirty thousand of the Barbarian youth were
      enlisted in the troops; and the pious labours of Musa to
      inculcate the knowledge and practice of the Koran, accustomed the
      Africans to obey the apostle of God and the commander of the
      faithful. In their climate and government, their diet and
      habitation, the wandering Moors resembled the Bedoweens of the
      desert. With the religion, they were proud to adopt the language,
      name, and origin of Arabs: the blood of the strangers and natives
      was insensibly mingled; and from the Euphrates to the Atlantic
      the same nation might seem to be diffused over the sandy plains
      of Asia and Africa. Yet I will not deny that fifty thousand tents
      of pure Arabians might be transported over the Nile, and
      scattered through the Lybian desert: and I am not ignorant that
      five of the Moorish tribes still retain their barbarous idiom,
      with the appellation and character of white Africans.163

      [A. D. 709.] V. In the progress of conquest from the north and
      south, the Goths and the Saracens encountered each other on the
      confines of Europe and Africa. In the opinion of the latter, the
      difference of religion is a reasonable ground of enmity and
      warfare.164 As early as the time of Othman165 their piratical
      squadrons had ravaged the coast of Andalusia;166 nor had they
      forgotten the relief of Carthage by the Gothic succours. In that
      age, as well as in the present, the kings of Spain were possessed
      of the fortress of Ceuta; one of the columns of Hercules, which
      is divided by a narrow strait from the opposite pillar or point
      of Europe. A small portion of Mauritania was still wanting to the
      African conquest; but Musa, in the pride of victory, was repulsed
      from the walls of Ceuta, by the vigilance and courage of count
      Julian, the general of the Goths. From his disappointment and
      perplexity, Musa was relieved by an unexpected message of the
      Christian chief, who offered his place, his person, and his
      sword, to the successors of Mahomet, and solicited the
      disgraceful honour of introducing their arms into the heart of
      Spain.167

      four volumes, folio, with the continuation of Miniana), the style
      and spirit of a Roman classic; and after the twelfth century, his

      not exempt from the prejudices of his order; he adopts and
      adorns, like his rival Buchanan, the most absurd of the national
      legends; he is too careless of criticism and chronology, and
      supplies, from a lively fancy, the chasms of historical evidence.

      Toledo, the father of the Spanish history, lived five hundred
      years after the conquest of the Arabs; and the more early
      accounts are comprised in some meagre lines of the blind
      chronicles of Isidore of Badajoz (Pacensis,) and of Alphonso III.
      king of Leon, which I have seen only in the Annals of Pagi.]

      If we inquire into the cause of this treachery, the Spaniards
      will repeat the popular story of his daughter Cava;168 of a
      virgin who was seduced, or ravished, by her sovereign; of a
      father who sacrificed his religion and country to the thirst of
      revenge. The passions of princes have often been licentious and
      destructive; but this well-known tale, romantic in itself, is
      indifferently supported by external evidence; and the history of
      Spain will suggest some motives of interest and policy more
      congenial to the breast of a veteran statesman.169 After the
      decease or deposition of Witiza, his two sons were supplanted by
      the ambition of Roderic, a noble Goth, whose father, the duke or
      governor of a province, had fallen a victim to the preceding
      tyranny. The monarchy was still elective; but the sons of Witiza,
      educated on the steps of the throne, were impatient of a private
      station. Their resentment was the more dangerous, as it was
      varnished with the dissimulation of courts: their followers were
      excited by the remembrance of favours and the promise of a
      revolution: and their uncle Oppas, archbishop of Toledo and
      Seville, was the first person in the church, and the second in
      the state. It is probable that Julian was involved in the
      disgrace of the unsuccessful faction, that he had little to hope
      and much to fear from the new reign; and that the imprudent king
      could not forget or forgive the injuries which Roderic and his
      family had sustained. The merit and influence of the count
      rendered him a useful or formidable subject: his estates were
      ample, his followers bold and numerous, and it was too fatally
      shown that, by his Andalusian and Mauritanian commands, he held
      in his hands the keys of the Spanish monarchy. Too feeble,
      however, to meet his sovereign in arms, he sought the aid of a
      foreign power; and his rash invitation of the Moors and Arabs
      produced the calamities of eight hundred years. In his epistles,
      or in a personal interview, he revealed the wealth and nakedness
      of his country; the weakness of an unpopular prince; the
      degeneracy of an effeminate people. The Goths were no longer the
      victorious Barbarians, who had humbled the pride of Rome,
      despoiled the queen of nations, and penetrated from the Danube to
      the Atlantic ocean. Secluded from the world by the Pyrenean
      mountains, the successors of Alaric had slumbered in a long
      peace: the walls of the city were mouldered into dust: the youth
      had abandoned the exercise of arms; and the presumption of their
      ancient renown would expose them in a field of battle to the
      first assault of the invaders. The ambitious Saracen was fired by
      the ease and importance of the attempt; but the execution was
      delayed till he had consulted the commander of the faithful; and
      his messenger returned with the permission of Walid to annex the
      unknown kingdoms of the West to the religion and throne of the
      caliphs. In his residence of Tangier, Musa, with secrecy and
      caution, continued his correspondence and hastened his
      preparations. But the remorse of the conspirators was soothed by
      the fallacious assurance that he should content himself with the
      glory and spoil, without aspiring to establish the Moslems beyond
      the sea that separates Africa from Europe.170

      [A. D. 710.] Before Musa would trust an army of the faithful to
      the traitors and infidels of a foreign land, he made a less
      dangerous trial of their strength and veracity. One hundred Arabs
      and four hundred Africans, passed over, in four vessels, from
      Tangier or Ceuta; the place of their descent on the opposite
      shore of the strait, is marked by the name of Tarif their chief;
      and the date of this memorable event171 is fixed to the month of
      Ramandan, of the ninety-first year of the Hegira, to the month of
      July, seven hundred and forty-eight years from the Spanish era of
      Cesar,172 seven hundred and ten after the birth of Christ. From
      their first station, they marched eighteen miles through a hilly
      country to the castle and town of Julian;173 on which (it is
      still called Algezire) they bestowed the name of the Green
      Island, from a verdant cape that advances into the sea. Their
      hospitable entertainment, the Christians who joined their
      standard, their inroad into a fertile and unguarded province, the
      richness of their spoil and the safety of their return, announced
      to their brethren the most favourable omens of victory. In the
      ensuing spring, five thousand veterans and volunteers were
      embarked under the command of Tarik, a dauntless and skilful
      soldier, who surpassed the expectation of his chief; and the
      necessary transports were provided by the industry of their too
      faithful ally. The Saracens landed174 at the pillar or point of
      Europe; the corrupt and familiar appellation of Gibraltar (Gebel
      el Tarik) describes the mountain of Tarik; and the intrenchments
      of his camp were the first outline of those fortifications,
      which, in the hands of our countrymen, have resisted the art and
      power of the house of Bourbon. The adjacent governors informed
      the court of Toledo of the descent and progress of the Arabs; and
      the defeat of his lieutenant Edeco, who had been commanded to
      seize and bind the presumptuous strangers, admonished Roderic of
      the magnitude of the danger. At the royal summons, the dukes and
      counts, the bishops and nobles of the Gothic monarchy assembled
      at the head of their followers; and the title of king of the
      Romans, which is employed by an Arabic historian, may be excused
      by the close affinity of language, religion, and manners, between
      the nations of Spain. His army consisted of ninety or a hundred
      thousand men: a formidable power, if their fidelity and
      discipline had been adequate to their numbers. The troops of
      Tarik had been augmented to twelve thousand Saracens; but the
      Christian malcontents were attracted by the influence of Julian,
      and a crowd of Africans most greedily tasted the temporal
      blessings of the Koran. In the neighbourhood of Cadiz, the town
      of Xeres175 has been illustrated by the encounter which
      determined the fate of the kingdom; the stream of the Guadalete,
      which falls into the bay, divided the two camps, and marked the
      advancing and retreating skirmishes of three successive and
      bloody days.

      171 (return) [ A mistake of Roderic of Toledo, in comparing the
      lunar years of the Hegira with the Julian years of the Era, has
      determined Baronius, Mariana, and the crowd of Spanish
      historians, to place the first invasion in the year 713, and the
      battle of Xeres in November, 714. This anachronism of three years
      has been detected by the more correct industry of modern
      chronologists, above all, of Pagi (Critics, tom. iii. p. 164.
      171-174), who have restored the genuine state of the revolution.

      175 (return) [ Xeres (the Roman colony of Asta Regia) is only two
      leagues from Cadiz. In the xvith century It was a granary of
      corn; and the wine of Xeres is familiar to the nations of Europe
      (Lud. Nonii Hispania, c. 13, p. 54-56, a work of correct and
      concise knowledge; d’Anville, Etats de l’Europe &c p 154).]

      On the fourth day, the two armies joined a more serious and
      decisive issue; but Alaric would have blushed at the sight of his
      unworthy successor, sustaining on his head a diadem of pearls,
      encumbered with a flowing robe of gold and silken embroidery, and
      reclining on a litter, or car of ivory, drawn by two white mules.
      Notwithstanding the valour of the Saracens, they fainted under
      the weight of multitudes, and the plain of Xeres was overspread
      with sixteen thousand of their dead bodies. “My brethren,” said
      Tarik to his surviving companions, “the enemy is before you, the
      sea is behind; whither would ye fly? Follow your general I am
      resolved either to lose my life, or to trample on the prostrate
      king of the Romans.” Besides the resource of despair, he confided
      in the secret correspondence and nocturnal interviews of count
      Julian, with the sons and the brother of Witiza. The two princes
      and the archbishop of Toledo occupied the most important post;
      their well-timed defection broke the ranks of the Christians;
      each warrior was prompted by fear or suspicion to consult his
      personal safety; and the remains of the Gothic army were
      scattered or destroyed to the flight and pursuit of the three
      following days. Amidst the general disorder, Roderic started from
      his car, and mounted Orelia, the fleetest of his Horses; but he
      escaped from a soldier’s death to perish more ignobly in the
      waters of the Boetis or Guadalquiver. His diadem, his robes, and
      his courser, were found on the bank; but as the body of the
      Gothic prince was lost in the waves, the pride and ignorance of
      the caliph must have been gratified with some meaner head, which
      was exposed in triumph before the palace of Damascus. “And such,”
      continues a valiant historian of the Arabs, “is the fate of those
      kings who withdraw themselves from a field of battle.” 176

      [A. D. 711.] Count Julian had plunged so deep into guilt and
      infamy, that his only hope was in the ruin of his country. After
      the battle of Xeres he recommended the most effectual measures to
      the victorious Saracens. “The king of the Goths is slain; their
      princes are fled before you, the army is routed, the nation is
      astonished. Secure with sufficient detachments the cities of
      Boetica; but in person and without delay, march to the royal city
      of Toledo, and allow not the distracted Christians either time or
      tranquillity for the election of a new monarch.” Tarik listened
      to his advice. A Roman captive and proselyte, who had been
      enfranchised by the caliph himself, assaulted Cordova with seven
      hundred horse: he swam the river, surprised the town, and drove
      the Christians into the great church, where they defended
      themselves above three months. Another detachment reduced the
      seacoast of Boetica, which in the last period of the Moorish
      power has comprised in a narrow space the populous kingdom of
      Grenada. The march of Tarik from the Boetis to the Tagus,177 was
      directed through the Sierra Morena, that separates Andalusia and
      Castille, till he appeared in arms under the walls of Toledo.178
      The most zealous of the Catholics had escaped with the relics of
      their saints; and if the gates were shut, it was only till the
      victor had subscribed a fair and reasonable capitulation. The
      voluntary exiles were allowed to depart with their effects; seven
      churches were appropriated to the Christian worship; the
      archbishop and his clergy were at liberty to exercise their
      functions, the monks to practise or neglect their penance; and
      the Goths and Romans were left in all civil or criminal cases to
      the subordinate jurisdiction of their own laws and magistrates.
      But if the justice of Tarik protected the Christians, his
      gratitude and policy rewarded the Jews, to whose secret or open
      aid he was indebted for his most important acquisitions.
      Persecuted by the kings and synods of Spain, who had often
      pressed the alternative of banishment or baptism, that outcast
      nation embraced the moment of revenge: the comparison of their
      past and present state was the pledge of their fidelity; and the
      alliance between the disciples of Moses and those of Mahomet, was
      maintained till the final era of their common expulsion.

      From the royal seat of Toledo, the Arabian leader spread his
      conquests to the north, over the modern realms of Castille and
      Leon; but it is heedless to enumerate the cities that yielded on
      his approach, or again to describe the table of emerald,179
      transported from the East by the Romans, acquired by the Goths
      among the spoils of Rome, and presented by the Arabs to the
      throne of Damascus. Beyond the Asturian mountains, the maritime
      town of Gijon was the term180 of the lieutenant of Musa, who had
      performed with the speed of a traveller, his victorious march of
      seven hundred miles, from the rock of Gibraltar to the bay of
      Biscay. The failure of land compelled him to retreat: and he was
      recalled to Toledo, to excuse his presumption of subduing a
      kingdom in the absence of his general. Spain, which in a more
      savage and disorderly state, had resisted, two hundred years, the
      arms of the Romans, was overrun in a few months by those of the
      Saracens; and such was the eagerness of submission and treaty,
      that the governor of Cordova is recorded as the only chief who
      fell, without conditions, a prisoner into their hands. The cause
      of the Goths had been irrevocably judged in the field of Xeres;
      and in the national dismay, each part of the monarchy declined a
      contest with the antagonist who had vanquished the united
      strength of the whole.181 That strength had been wasted by two
      successive seasons of famine and pestilence; and the governors,
      who were impatient to surrender, might exaggerate the difficulty
      of collecting the provisions of a siege. To disarm the
      Christians, superstition likewise contributed her terrors: and
      the subtle Arab encouraged the report of dreams, omens, and
      prophecies, and of the portraits of the destined conquerors of
      Spain, that were discovered on the breaking open an apartment of
      the royal palace. Yet a spark of the vital flame was still alive;
      some invincible fugitives preferred a life of poverty and freedom
      in the Asturian valleys; the hardy mountaineers repulsed the
      slaves of the caliph; and the sword of Pelagius has been
      transformed into the sceptre of the Catholic kings.182

      Chapter LI: Conquests By The Arabs.—Part VII.

      On the intelligence of this rapid success, the applause of Musa
      degenerated into envy; and he began, not to complain, but to
      fear, that Tarik would leave him nothing to subdue. At the head
      of ten thousand Arabs and eight thousand Africans, he passed over
      in person from Mauritania to Spain: the first of his companions
      were the noblest of the Koreish; his eldest son was left in the
      command of Africa; the three younger brethren were of an age and
      spirit to second the boldest enterprises of their father. At his
      landing in Algezire, he was respectfully entertained by Count
      Julian, who stifled his inward remorse, and testified, both in
      words and actions, that the victory of the Arabs had not impaired
      his attachment to their cause. Some enemies yet remained for the
      sword of Musa. The tardy repentance of the Goths had compared
      their own numbers and those of the invaders; the cities from
      which the march of Tarik had declined considered themselves as
      impregnable; and the bravest patriots defended the fortifications
      of Seville and Merida. They were successively besieged and
      reduced by the labor of Musa, who transported his camp from the
      Boetis to the Anas, from the Guadalquivir to the Guadiana. When
      he beheld the works of Roman magnificence, the bridge, the
      aqueducts, the triumphal arches, and the theatre, of the ancient
      metropolis of Lusitania, “I should imagine,” said he to his four
      companions, “that the human race must have united their art and
      power in the foundation of this city: happy is the man who shall
      become its master!” He aspired to that happiness, but the
      Emeritans sustained on this occasion the honor of their descent
      from the veteran legionaries of Augustus 183 Disdaining the
      confinement of their walls, they gave battle to the Arabs on the
      plain; but an ambuscade rising from the shelter of a quarry, or a
      ruin, chastised their indiscretion, and intercepted their return.

      The wooden turrets of assault were rolled forwards to the foot of
      the rampart; but the defence of Merida was obstinate and long;
      and the castle of the martyrs was a perpetual testimony of the
      losses of the Moslems. The constancy of the besieged was at
      length subdued by famine and despair; and the prudent victor
      disguised his impatience under the names of clemency and esteem.
      The alternative of exile or tribute was allowed; the churches
      were divided between the two religions; and the wealth of those
      who had fallen in the siege, or retired to Gallicia, was
      confiscated as the reward of the faithful. In the midway between
      Merida and Toledo, the lieutenant of Musa saluted the vicegerent
      of the caliph, and conducted him to the palace of the Gothic
      kings. Their first interview was cold and formal: a rigid account
      was exacted of the treasures of Spain: the character of Tarik was
      exposed to suspicion and obloquy; and the hero was imprisoned,
      reviled, and ignominiously scourged by the hand, or the command,
      of Musa. Yet so strict was the discipline, so pure the zeal, or
      so tame the spirit, of the primitive Moslems, that, after this
      public indignity, Tarik could serve and be trusted in the
      reduction of the Tarragonest province. A mosch was erected at
      Saragossa, by the liberality of the Koreish: the port of
      Barcelona was opened to the vessels of Syria; and the Goths were
      pursued beyond the Pyrenaean mountains into their Gallic province
      of Septimania or Languedoc. 184 In the church of St. Mary at
      Carcassone, Musa found, but it is improbable that he left, seven
      equestrian statues of massy silver; and from his term or column
      of Narbonne, he returned on his footsteps to the Gallician and
      Lusitanian shores of the ocean. During the absence of the father,
      his son Abdelaziz chastised the insurgents of Seville, and
      reduced, from Malaga to Valentia, the sea-coast of the
      Mediterranean: his original treaty with the discreet and valiant
      Theodemir 185 will represent the manners and policy of the times.
      “The conditions of peace agreed and sworn between Abdelaziz, the
      son of Musa, the son of Nassir, and Theodemir prince of the
      Goths. In the name of the most merciful God, Abdelaziz makes
      peace on these conditions: that Theodemir shall not be disturbed
      in his principality; nor any injury be offered to the life or
      property, the wives and children, the religion and temples, of
      the Christians: that Theodemir shall freely deliver his seven
      1851 cities, Orihuela, Valentola, Alicanti Mola, Vacasora,
      Bigerra, (now Bejar,) Ora, (or Opta,) and Lorca: that he shall
      not assist or entertain the enemies of the caliph, but shall
      faithfully communicate his knowledge of their hostile designs:
      that himself, and each of the Gothic nobles, shall annually pay
      one piece of gold, four measures of wheat, as many of barley,
      with a certain proportion of honey, oil, and vinegar; and that
      each of their vassals shall be taxed at one moiety of the said
      imposition. Given the fourth of Regeb, in the year of the Hegira
      ninety-four, and subscribed with the names of four Mussulman
      witnesses.” 186 Theodemir and his subjects were treated with
      uncommon lenity; but the rate of tribute appears to have
      fluctuated from a tenth to a fifth, according to the submission
      or obstinacy of the Christians. 187 In this revolution, many
      partial calamities were inflicted by the carnal or religious
      passions of the enthusiasts: some churches were profaned by the
      new worship: some relics or images were confounded with idols:
      the rebels were put to the sword; and one town (an obscure place
      between Cordova and Seville) was razed to its foundations. Yet if
      we compare the invasion of Spain by the Goths, or its recovery by
      the kings of Castile and Arragon, we must applaud the moderation
      and discipline of the Arabian conquerors.

      The exploits of Musa were performed in the evening of life,
      though he affected to disguise his age by coloring with a red
      powder the whiteness of his beard. But in the love of action and
      glory, his breast was still fired with the ardor of youth; and
      the possession of Spain was considered only as the first step to
      the monarchy of Europe. With a powerful armament by sea and land,
      he was preparing to repass the Pyrenees, to extinguish in Gaul
      and Italy the declining kingdoms of the Franks and Lombards, and
      to preach the unity of God on the altar of the Vatican. From
      thence, subduing the Barbarians of Germany, he proposed to follow
      the course of the Danube from its source to the Euxine Sea, to
      overthrow the Greek or Roman empire of Constantinople, and
      returning from Europe to Asia, to unite his new acquisitions with
      Antioch and the provinces of Syria. 188 But his vast enterprise,
      perhaps of easy execution, must have seemed extravagant to vulgar
      minds; and the visionary conqueror was soon reminded of his
      dependence and servitude. The friends of Tarik had effectually
      stated his services and wrongs: at the court of Damascus, the
      proceedings of Musa were blamed, his intentions were suspected,
      and his delay in complying with the first invitation was
      chastised by a harsher and more peremptory summons. An intrepid
      messenger of the caliph entered his camp at Lugo in Gallicia, and
      in the presence of the Saracens and Christians arrested the
      bridle of his horse. His own loyalty, or that of his troops,
      inculcated the duty of obedience: and his disgrace was alleviated
      by the recall of his rival, and the permission of investing with
      his two governments his two sons, Abdallah and Abdelaziz. His
      long triumph from Ceuta to Damascus displayed the spoils of
      Africa and the treasures of Spain: four hundred Gothic nobles,
      with gold coronets and girdles, were distinguished in his train;
      and the number of male and female captives, selected for their
      birth or beauty, was computed at eighteen, or even at thirty,
      thousand persons. As soon as he reached Tiberias in Palestine, he
      was apprised of the sickness and danger of the caliph, by a
      private message from Soliman, his brother and presumptive heir;
      who wished to reserve for his own reign the spectacle of victory.

      Had Walid recovered, the delay of Musa would have been criminal:
      he pursued his march, and found an enemy on the throne. In his
      trial before a partial judge against a popular antagonist, he was
      convicted of vanity and falsehood; and a fine of two hundred
      thousand pieces of gold either exhausted his poverty or proved
      his rapaciousness. The unworthy treatment of Tarik was revenged
      by a similar indignity; and the veteran commander, after a public
      whipping, stood a whole day in the sun before the palace gate,
      till he obtained a decent exile, under the pious name of a
      pilgrimage to Mecca. The resentment of the caliph might have been
      satiated with the ruin of Musa; but his fears demanded the
      extirpation of a potent and injured family. A sentence of death
      was intimated with secrecy and speed to the trusty servants of
      the throne both in Africa and Spain; and the forms, if not the
      substance, of justice were superseded in this bloody execution.
      In the mosch or palace of Cordova, Abdelaziz was slain by the
      swords of the conspirators; they accused their governor of
      claiming the honors of royalty; and his scandalous marriage with
      Egilona, the widow of Roderic, offended the prejudices both of
      the Christians and Moslems. By a refinement of cruelty, the head
      of the son was presented to the father, with an insulting
      question, whether he acknowledged the features of the rebel? “I
      know his features,” he exclaimed with indignation: “I assert his
      innocence; and I imprecate the same, a juster fate, against the
      authors of his death.” The age and despair of Musa raised him
      above the power of kings; and he expired at Mecca of the anguish
      of a broken heart. His rival was more favorably treated: his
      services were forgiven; and Tarik was permitted to mingle with
      the crowd of slaves. 189 I am ignorant whether Count Julian was
      rewarded with the death which he deserved indeed, though not from
      the hands of the Saracens; but the tale of their ingratitude to
      the sons of Witiza is disproved by the most unquestionable
      evidence. The two royal youths were reinstated in the private
      patrimony of their father; but on the decease of Eba, the elder,
      his daughter was unjustly despoiled of her portion by the
      violence of her uncle Sigebut. The Gothic maid pleaded her cause
      before the caliph Hashem, and obtained the restitution of her
      inheritance; but she was given in marriage to a noble Arabian,
      and their two sons, Isaac and Ibrahim, were received in Spain
      with the consideration that was due to their origin and riches.

      188 (return) [ This design, which is attested by several Arabian
      historians, (Cardonne, tom. i. p. 95, 96,) may be compared with
      that of Mithridates, to march from the Crimaea to Rome; or with

      North; and all three are perhaps surpassed by the real and
      successful enterprise of Hannibal.]

      189 (return) [ I much regret our loss, or my ignorance, of two
      Arabic works of the viiith century, a Life of Musa, and a poem on
      the exploits of Tarik. Of these authentic pieces, the former was
      composed by a grandson of Musa, who had escaped from the massacre
      of his kindred; the latter, by the vizier of the first
      Abdalrahman, caliph of Spain, who might have conversed with some
      of the veterans of the conqueror, (Bibliot. Arabico-Hispana, tom.
      ii. p. 36, 139.)]

      A province is assimilated to the victorious state by the
      introduction of strangers and the imitative spirit of the
      natives; and Spain, which had been successively tinctured with
      Punic, and Roman, and Gothic blood, imbibed, in a few
      generations, the name and manners of the Arabs. The first
      conquerors, and the twenty successive lieutenants of the caliphs,
      were attended by a numerous train of civil and military
      followers, who preferred a distant fortune to a narrow home: the
      private and public interest was promoted by the establishment of
      faithful colonies; and the cities of Spain were proud to
      commemorate the tribe or country of their Eastern progenitors.
      The victorious though motley bands of Tarik and Musa asserted, by
      the name of Spaniards, their original claim of conquest; yet they
      allowed their brethren of Egypt to share their establishments of
      Murcia and Lisbon. The royal legion of Damascus was planted at
      Cordova; that of Emesa at Seville; that of Kinnisrin or Chalcis
      at Jaen; that of Palestine at Algezire and Medina Sidonia. The
      natives of Yemen and Persia were scattered round Toledo and the
      inland country, and the fertile seats of Grenada were bestowed on
      ten thousand horsemen of Syria and Irak, the children of the
      purest and most noble of the Arabian tribes. 190 A spirit of
      emulation, sometimes beneficial, more frequently dangerous, was
      nourished by these hereditary factions. Ten years after the
      conquest, a map of the province was presented to the caliph: the
      seas, the rivers, and the harbors, the inhabitants and cities,
      the climate, the soil, and the mineral productions of the earth.
      191 In the space of two centuries, the gifts of nature were
      improved by the agriculture, 192 the manufactures, and the
      commerce, of an industrious people; and the effects of their
      diligence have been magnified by the idleness of their fancy. The
      first of the Ommiades who reigned in Spain solicited the support
      of the Christians; and in his edict of peace and protection, he
      contents himself with a modest imposition of ten thousand ounces
      of gold, ten thousand pounds of silver, ten thousand horses, as
      many mules, one thousand cuirasses, with an equal number of
      helmets and lances. 193 The most powerful of his successors
      derived from the same kingdom the annual tribute of twelve
      millions and forty-five thousand dinars or pieces of gold, about
      six millions of sterling money; 194 a sum which, in the tenth
      century, most probably surpassed the united revenues of the
      Christians monarchs. His royal seat of Cordova contained six
      hundred moschs, nine hundred baths, and two hundred thousand
      houses; he gave laws to eighty cities of the first, to three
      hundred of the second and third order; and the fertile banks of
      the Guadalquivir were adorned with twelve thousand villages and
      hamlets. The Arabs might exaggerate the truth, but they created
      and they describe the most prosperous aera of the riches, the
      cultivation, and the populousness of Spain. 195

      The wars of the Moslems were sanctified by the prophet; but among
      the various precepts and examples of his life, the caliphs
      selected the lessons of toleration that might tend to disarm the
      resistance of the unbelievers. Arabia was the temple and
      patrimony of the God of Mahomet; but he beheld with less jealousy
      and affection the nations of the earth. The polytheists and
      idolaters, who were ignorant of his name, might be lawfully
      extirpated by his votaries; 196 but a wise policy supplied the
      obligation of justice; and after some acts of intolerant zeal,
      the Mahometan conquerors of Hindostan have spared the pagodas of
      that devout and populous country. The disciples of Abraham, of
      Moses, and of Jesus, were solemnly invited to accept the more
      perfect revelation of Mahomet; but if they preferred the payment
      of a moderate tribute, they were entitled to the freedom of
      conscience and religious worship. 197 In a field of battle the
      forfeit lives of the prisoners were redeemed by the profession of
      Islam; the females were bound to embrace the religion of their
      masters, and a race of sincere proselytes was gradually
      multiplied by the education of the infant captives. But the
      millions of African and Asiatic converts, who swelled the native
      band of the faithful Arabs, must have been allured, rather than
      constrained, to declare their belief in one God and the apostle
      of God. By the repetition of a sentence and the loss of a
      foreskin, the subject or the slave, the captive or the criminal,
      arose in a moment the free and equal companion of the victorious
      Moslems. Every sin was expiated, every engagement was dissolved:
      the vow of celibacy was superseded by the indulgence of nature;
      the active spirits who slept in the cloister were awakened by the
      trumpet of the Saracens; and in the convulsion of the world,
      every member of a new society ascended to the natural level of
      his capacity and courage. The minds of the multitude were tempted
      by the invisible as well as temporal blessings of the Arabian
      prophet; and charity will hope that many of his proselytes
      entertained a serious conviction of the truth and sanctity of his
      revelation. In the eyes of an inquisitive polytheist, it must
      appear worthy of the human and the divine nature. More pure than
      the system of Zoroaster, more liberal than the law of Moses, the
      religion of Mahomet might seem less inconsistent with reason than
      the creed of mystery and superstition, which, in the seventh
      century, disgraced the simplicity of the gospel.

      197 (return) [ The distinction between a proscribed and a
      tolerated sect, between the Harbii and the people of the Book,
      the believers in some divine revelation, is correctly defined in
      the conversation of the caliph Al Mamum with the idolaters or
      Sabaeans of Charrae, (Hottinger, Hist. Orient. p. 107, 108.)]

      In the extensive provinces of Persia and Africa, the national
      religion has been eradicated by the Mahometan faith. The
      ambiguous theology of the Magi stood alone among the sects of the
      East; but the profane writings of Zoroaster 198 might, under the
      reverend name of Abraham, be dexterously connected with the chain
      of divine revelation. Their evil principle, the daemon Ahriman,
      might be represented as the rival, or as the creature, of the God
      of light. The temples of Persia were devoid of images; but the
      worship of the sun and of fire might be stigmatized as a gross
      and criminal idolatry. 199 The milder sentiment was consecrated
      by the practice of Mahomet 200 and the prudence of the caliphs;
      the Magians or Ghebers were ranked with the Jews and Christians
      among the people of the written law; 201 and as late as the third
      century of the Hegira, the city of Herat will afford a lively
      contrast of private zeal and public toleration. 202 Under the
      payment of an annual tribute, the Mahometan law secured to the
      Ghebers of Herat their civil and religious liberties: but the
      recent and humble mosch was overshadowed by the antique splendor
      of the adjoining temple of fire. A fanatic Imam deplored, in his
      sermons, the scandalous neighborhood, and accused the weakness or
      indifference of the faithful. Excited by his voice, the people
      assembled in tumult; the two houses of prayer were consumed by
      the flames, but the vacant ground was immediately occupied by the
      foundations of a new mosch. The injured Magi appealed to the
      sovereign of Chorasan; he promised justice and relief; when,
      behold! four thousand citizens of Herat, of a grave character and
      mature age, unanimously swore that the idolatrous fane had never
      existed; the inquisition was silenced and their conscience was
      satisfied (says the historian Mirchond 203 with this holy and
      meritorious perjury. 204 But the greatest part of the temples of
      Persia were ruined by the insensible and general desertion of
      their votaries.

      It was insensible, since it is not accompanied with any memorial
      of time or place, of persecution or resistance. It was general,
      since the whole realm, from Shiraz to Samarcand, imbibed the
      faith of the Koran; and the preservation of the native tongue
      reveals the descent of the Mahometans of Persia. 205 In the
      mountains and deserts, an obstinate race of unbelievers adhered
      to the superstition of their fathers; and a faint tradition of
      the Magian theology is kept alive in the province of Kirman,
      along the banks of the Indus, among the exiles of Surat, and in
      the colony which, in the last century, was planted by Shaw Abbas
      at the gates of Ispahan. The chief pontiff has retired to Mount
      Elbourz, eighteen leagues from the city of Yezd: the perpetual
      fire (if it continues to burn) is inaccessible to the profane;
      but his residence is the school, the oracle, and the pilgrimage
      of the Ghebers, whose hard and uniform features attest the
      unmingled purity of their blood. Under the jurisdiction of their
      elders, eighty thousand families maintain an innocent and
      industrious life: their subsistence is derived from some curious
      manufactures and mechanic trades; and they cultivate the earth
      with the fervor of a religious duty. Their ignorance withstood
      the despotism of Shaw Abbas, who demanded with threats and
      tortures the prophetic books of Zoroaster; and this obscure
      remnant of the Magians is spared by the moderation or contempt of
      their present sovereigns. 206

      had been the slave and scholar of some Jewish prophet in the
      captivity of Babylon. Perhaps the Persians, who have been the

      1471.) In the year 904 (A.D. 1498) the historian obtained the
      command of a princely library, and his applauded work, in seven
      or twelve parts, was abbreviated in three volumes by his son
      Khondemir, A. H. 927, A.D. 1520. The two writers, most accurately
      distinguished by Petit de la Croix, (Hist. de Genghizcan, p.537,
      538, 544, 545,) are loosely confounded by D’Herbelot, (p. 358,
      410, 994, 995: ) but his numerous extracts, under the improper
      name of Khondemir, belong to the father rather than the son. The

      soldiers and successors, the Bowides either professed or embraced

      should say the fall of the religion of Zoroaster.]

      della Valle, Olearius, Thevenot, Tavernier, &c., whom I have
      fruitlessly searched, had neither eyes nor attention for this

      The Northern coast of Africa is the only land in which the light
      of the gospel, after a long and perfect establishment, has been
      totally extinguished. The arts, which had been taught by Carthage
      and Rome, were involved in a cloud of ignorance; the doctrine of
      Cyprian and Augustin was no longer studied. Five hundred
      episcopal churches were overturned by the hostile fury of the
      Donatists, the Vandals, and the Moors. The zeal and numbers of
      the clergy declined; and the people, without discipline, or
      knowledge, or hope, submissively sunk under the yoke of the
      Arabian prophet. Within fifty years after the expulsion of the
      Greeks, a lieutenant of Africa informed the caliph that the
      tribute of the infidels was abolished by their conversion; 207
      and, though he sought to disguise his fraud and rebellion, his
      specious pretence was drawn from the rapid and extensive progress
      of the Mahometan faith. In the next age, an extraordinary mission
      of five bishops was detached from Alexandria to Cairoan. They
      were ordained by the Jacobite patriarch to cherish and revive the
      dying embers of Christianity: 208 but the interposition of a
      foreign prelate, a stranger to the Latins, an enemy to the
      Catholics, supposes the decay and dissolution of the African
      hierarchy. It was no longer the time when the successor of St.
      Cyprian, at the head of a numerous synod, could maintain an equal
      contest with the ambition of the Roman pontiff. In the eleventh
      century, the unfortunate priest who was seated on the ruins of
      Carthage implored the arms and the protection of the Vatican; and
      he bitterly complains that his naked body had been scourged by
      the Saracens, and that his authority was disputed by the four
      suffragans, the tottering pillars of his throne. Two epistles of
      Gregory the Seventh 209 are destined to soothe the distress of
      the Catholics and the pride of a Moorish prince. The pope assures
      the sultan that they both worship the same God, and may hope to
      meet in the bosom of Abraham; but the complaint that three
      bishops could no longer be found to consecrate a brother,
      announces the speedy and inevitable ruin of the episcopal order.
      The Christians of Africa and Spain had long since submitted to
      the practice of circumcision and the legal abstinence from wine
      and pork; and the name of Mozarabes 210 (adoptive Arabs) was
      applied to their civil or religious conformity. 211 About the
      middle of the twelfth century, the worship of Christ and the
      succession of pastors were abolished along the coast of Barbary,
      and in the kingdoms of Cordova and Seville, of Valencia and
      Grenada. 212 The throne of the Almohades, or Unitarians, was
      founded on the blindest fanaticism, and their extraordinary rigor
      might be provoked or justified by the recent victories and
      intolerant zeal of the princes of Sicily and Castille, of Arragon
      and Portugal. The faith of the Mozarabes was occasionally revived
      by the papal missionaries; and, on the landing of Charles the
      Fifth, some families of Latin Christians were encouraged to rear
      their heads at Tunis and Algiers. But the seed of the gospel was
      quickly eradicated, and the long province from Tripoli to the
      Atlantic has lost all memory of the language and religion of
      Rome. 213

      of a jurisprudence, which states the civil rights of the
      Christians of Cordova, (Bibliot. Arab. Hisp. tom. i. p. 471;) and
      that the Jews were the only dissenters whom Abul Waled, king of

      After the revolution of eleven centuries, the Jews and Christians
      of the Turkish empire enjoy the liberty of conscience which was
      granted by the Arabian caliphs. During the first age of the
      conquest, they suspected the loyalty of the Catholics, whose name
      of Melchites betrayed their secret attachment to the Greek
      emperor, while the Nestorians and Jacobites, his inveterate
      enemies, approved themselves the sincere and voluntary friends of
      the Mahometan government. 214 Yet this partial jealousy was
      healed by time and submission; the churches of Egypt were shared
      with the Catholics; 215 and all the Oriental sects were included
      in the common benefits of toleration. The rank, the immunities,
      the domestic jurisdiction of the patriarchs, the bishops, and the
      clergy, were protected by the civil magistrate: the learning of
      individuals recommended them to the employments of secretaries
      and physicians: they were enriched by the lucrative collection of
      the revenue; and their merit was sometimes raised to the command
      of cities and provinces. A caliph of the house of Abbas was heard
      to declare that the Christians were most worthy of trust in the
      administration of Persia. “The Moslems,” said he, “will abuse
      their present fortune; the Magians regret their fallen greatness;
      and the Jews are impatient for their approaching deliverance.”
      216 But the slaves of despotism are exposed to the alternatives
      of favor and disgrace. The captive churches of the East have been
      afflicted in every age by the avarice or bigotry of their rulers;
      and the ordinary and legal restraints must be offensive to the
      pride, or the zeal, of the Christians. 217 About two hundred
      years after Mahomet, they were separated from their
      fellow-subjects by a turban or girdle of a less honorable color;
      instead of horses or mules. they were condemned to ride on asses,
      in the attitude of women. Their public and private building were
      measured by a diminutive standard; in the streets or the baths it
      is their duty to give way or bow down before the meanest of the
      people; and their testimony is rejected, if it may tend to the
      prejudice of a true believer. The pomp of processions, the sound
      of bells or of psalmody, is interdicted in their worship; a
      decent reverence for the national faith is imposed on their
      sermons and conversations; and the sacrilegious attempt to enter
      a mosch, or to seduce a Mussulman, will not be suffered to escape
      with impunity. In a time, however, of tranquillity and justice,
      the Christians have never been compelled to renounce the Gospel,
      or to embrace the Koran; but the punishment of death is inflicted
      upon the apostates who have professed and deserted the law of
      Mahomet. The martyrs of Cordova provoked the sentence of the
      cadhi, by the public confession of their inconstancy, or their
      passionate invectives against the person and religion of the
      prophet. 218

      censured their rashness. The moderate Fleury cannot reconcile

      throw a strong, though transient, light on the Spanish church in
      the ixth century.]

      At the end of the first century of the Hegira, the caliphs were
      the most potent and absolute monarchs of the globe. Their
      prerogative was not circumscribed, either in right or in fact, by
      the power of the nobles, the freedom of the commons, the
      privileges of the church, the votes of a senate, or the memory of
      a free constitution. The authority of the companions of Mahomet
      expired with their lives; and the chiefs or emirs of the Arabian
      tribes left behind, in the desert, the spirit of equality and
      independence. The regal and sacerdotal characters were united in
      the successors of Mahomet; and if the Koran was the rule of their
      actions, they were the supreme judges and interpreters of that
      divine book. They reigned by the right of conquest over the
      nations of the East, to whom the name of liberty was unknown, and
      who were accustomed to applaud in their tyrants the acts of
      violence and severity that were exercised at their own expense.
      Under the last of the Ommiades, the Arabian empire extended two
      hundred days’ journey from east to west, from the confines of
      Tartary and India to the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. And if we
      retrench the sleeve of the robe, as it is styled by their
      writers, the long and narrow province of Africa, the solid and
      compact dominion from Fargana to Aden, from Tarsus to Surat, will
      spread on every side to the measure of four or five months of the
      march of a caravan. 219 We should vainly seek the indissoluble
      union and easy obedience that pervaded the government of Augustus
      and the Antonines; but the progress of the Mahometan religion
      diffused over this ample space a general resemblance of manners
      and opinions. The language and laws of the Koran were studied
      with equal devotion at Samarcand and Seville: the Moor and the
      Indian embraced as countrymen and brothers in the pilgrimage of
      Mecca; and the Arabian language was adopted as the popular idiom
      in all the provinces to the westward of the Tigris. 220

      and the European Turkey.]

      Syria, Egypt, Africa, &c., to the Provencal, Spanish, and
