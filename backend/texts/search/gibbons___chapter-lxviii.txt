Chapter LXVIII: Reign Of Mahomet The Second, Extinction Of
      Eastern Empire.—Part I.

     Reign And Character Of Mahomet The Second.—Siege, Assault, And
     Final Conquest, Of Constantinople By The Turks.—Death Of
     Constantine Palæologus.—Servitude Of The Greeks.— Extinction Of
     The Roman Empire In The East.—Consternation Of Europe.—Conquests
     And Death Of Mahomet The Second.

      The siege of Constantinople by the Turks attracts our first
      attention to the person and character of the great destroyer.
      Mahomet the Second 1 was the son of the second Amurath; and
      though his mother has been decorated with the titles of Christian
      and princess, she is more probably confounded with the numerous
      concubines who peopled from every climate the harem of the
      sultan. His first education and sentiments were those of a devout
      Mussulman; and as often as he conversed with an infidel, he
      purified his hands and face by the legal rites of ablution. Age
      and empire appear to have relaxed this narrow bigotry: his
      aspiring genius disdained to acknowledge a power above his own;
      and in his looser hours he presumed (it is said) to brand the
      prophet of Mecca as a robber and impostor. Yet the sultan
      persevered in a decent reverence for the doctrine and discipline
      of the Koran: 2 his private indiscretion must have been sacred
      from the vulgar ear; and we should suspect the credulity of
      strangers and sectaries, so prone to believe that a mind which is
      hardened against truth must be armed with superior contempt for
      absurdity and error. Under the tuition of the most skilful
      masters, Mahomet advanced with an early and rapid progress in the
      paths of knowledge; and besides his native tongue it is affirmed
      that he spoke or understood five languages, 3 the Arabic, the
      Persian, the Chaldæan or Hebrew, the Latin, and the Greek. The
      Persian might indeed contribute to his amusement, and the Arabic
      to his edification; and such studies are familiar to the Oriental
      youth. In the intercourse of the Greeks and Turks, a conqueror
      might wish to converse with the people over which he was
      ambitious to reign: his own praises in Latin poetry 4 or prose 5
      might find a passage to the royal ear; but what use or merit
      could recommend to the statesman or the scholar the uncouth
      dialect of his Hebrew slaves? The history and geography of the
      world were familiar to his memory: the lives of the heroes of the
      East, perhaps of the West, 6 excited his emulation: his skill in
      astrology is excused by the folly of the times, and supposes some
      rudiments of mathematical science; and a profane taste for the
      arts is betrayed in his liberal invitation and reward of the
      painters of Italy. 7 But the influence of religion and learning
      were employed without effect on his savage and licentious nature.
      I will not transcribe, nor do I firmly believe, the stories of
      his fourteen pages, whose bellies were ripped open in search of a
      stolen melon; or of the beauteous slave, whose head he severed
      from her body, to convince the Janizaries that their master was
      not the votary of love. 701 His sobriety is attested by the
      silence of the Turkish annals, which accuse three, and three
      only, of the Ottoman line of the vice of drunkenness. 8 But it
      cannot be denied that his passions were at once furious and
      inexorable; that in the palace, as in the field, a torrent of
      blood was spilt on the slightest provocation; and that the
      noblest of the captive youth were often dishonored by his
      unnatural lust. In the Albanian war he studied the lessons, and
      soon surpassed the example, of his father; and the conquest of
      two empires, twelve kingdoms, and two hundred cities, a vain and
      flattering account, is ascribed to his invincible sword. He was
      doubtless a soldier, and possibly a general; Constantinople has
      sealed his glory; but if we compare the means, the obstacles, and
      the achievements, Mahomet the Second must blush to sustain a
      parallel with Alexander or Timour. Under his command, the Ottoman
      forces were always more numerous than their enemies; yet their
      progress was bounded by the Euphrates and the Adriatic; and his
      arms were checked by Huniades and Scanderbeg, by the Rhodian
      knights and by the Persian king.

      1 (return) [ For the character of Mahomet II. it is dangerous to
      trust either the Turks or the Christians. The most moderate
      picture appears to be drawn by Phranza, (l. i. c. 33,) whose
      resentment had cooled in age and solitude; see likewise
      Spondanus, (A.D. 1451, No. 11,) and the continuator of Fleury,
      (tom. xxii. p. 552,) the _Elogia_ of Paulus Jovius, (l. iii. p.
      164—166,) and the Dictionnaire de Bayle, (tom. iii. p. 273—279.)]

      2 (return) [ Cantemir, (p. 115.) and the mosques which he
      founded, attest his public regard for religion. Mahomet freely
      disputed with the Gennadius on the two religions, (Spond. A.D.
      1453, No. 22.)]

      3 (return) [ Quinque linguas præter suam noverat, Græcam,
      Latinam, Chaldaicam, Persicam. The Latin translator of Phranza
      has dropped the Arabic, which the Koran must recommend to every
      Mussulman. * Note: It appears in the original Greek text, p. 95,
      edit. Bonn.—M.]

      4 (return) [ Philelphus, by a Latin ode, requested and obtained
      the liberty of his wife’s mother and sisters from the conqueror
      of Constantinople. It was delivered into the sultan’s hands by
      the envoys of the duke of Milan. Philelphus himself was suspected
      of a design of retiring to Constantinople; yet the orator often
      sounded the trumpet of holy war, (see his Life by M. Lancelot, in
      the Mémoires de l’Académie des Inscriptions, tom. x. p. 718, 724,
      &c.)]

      5 (return) [ Robert Valturio published at Verona, in 1483, his
      xii. books de Re Militari, in which he first mentions the use of
      bombs. By his patron Sigismund Malatesta, prince of Rimini, it
      had been addressed with a Latin epistle to Mahomet II.]

      6 (return) [ According to Phranza, he assiduously studied the
      lives and actions of Alexander, Augustus, Constantine, and
      Theodosius. I have read somewhere, that Plutarch’s Lives were
      translated by his orders into the Turkish language. If the sultan
      himself understood Greek, it must have been for the benefit of
      his subjects. Yet these lives are a school of freedom as well as
      of valor. * Note: Von Hammer disdainfully rejects this fable of
      Mahomet’s knowledge of languages. Knolles adds, that he delighted
      in reading the history of Alexander the Great, and of Julius
      Cæsar. The former, no doubt, was the Persian legend, which, it is
      remarkable, came back to Europe, and was popular throughout the
      middle ages as the “Romaunt of Alexander.” The founder of the
      Imperial dynasty of Rome, according to M. Von Hammer, is
      altogether unknown in the East. Mahomet was a great patron of
      Turkish literature: the romantic poems of Persia were translated,
      or imitated, under his patronage. Von Hammer vol ii. p. 268.—M.]

      7 (return) [ The famous Gentile Bellino, whom he had invited from
      Venice, was dismissed with a chain and collar of gold, and a
      purse of 3000 ducats. With Voltaire I laugh at the foolish story
      of a slave purposely beheaded to instruct the painter in the
      action of the muscles.]

      701 (return) [ This story, the subject of Johnson’s Irene, is
      rejected by M. Von Hammer, vol. ii. p. 208. The German
      historian’s general estimate of Mahomet’s character agrees in its
      more marked features with Gibbon’s.—M.]

      8 (return) [ These Imperial drunkards were Soliman I., Selim II.,
      and Amurath IV., (Cantemir, p. 61.) The sophis of Persia can
      produce a more regular succession; and in the last age, our
      European travellers were the witnesses and companions of their
      revels.]

      In the reign of Amurath, he twice tasted of royalty, and twice
      descended from the throne: his tender age was incapable of
      opposing his father’s restoration, but never could he forgive the
      viziers who had recommended that salutary measure. His nuptials
      were celebrated with the daughter of a Turkman emir; and, after a
      festival of two months, he departed from Adrianople with his
      bride, to reside in the government of Magnesia. Before the end of
      six weeks, he was recalled by a sudden message from the divan,
      which announced the decease of Amurath, and the mutinous spirit
      of the Janizaries. His speed and vigor commanded their obedience:
      he passed the Hellespont with a chosen guard: and at the distance
      of a mile from Adrianople, the viziers and emirs, the imams and
      cadhis, the soldiers and the people, fell prostrate before the
      new sultan. They affected to weep, they affected to rejoice: he
      ascended the throne at the age of twenty-one years, and removed
      the cause of sedition by the death, the inevitable death, of his
      infant brothers. 9 901 The ambassadors of Europe and Asia soon
      appeared to congratulate his accession and solicit his
      friendship; and to all he spoke the language of moderation and
      peace. The confidence of the Greek emperor was revived by the
      solemn oaths and fair assurances with which he sealed the
      ratification of the treaty: and a rich domain on the banks of the
      Strymon was assigned for the annual payment of three hundred
      thousand aspers, the pension of an Ottoman prince, who was
      detained at his request in the Byzantine court. Yet the neighbors
      of Mahomet might tremble at the severity with which a youthful
      monarch reformed the pomp of his father’s household: the expenses
      of luxury were applied to those of ambition, and a useless train
      of seven thousand falconers was either dismissed from his
      service, or enlisted in his troops. 902 In the first summer of
      his reign, he visited with an army the Asiatic provinces; but
      after humbling the pride, Mahomet accepted the submission, of the
      Caramanian, that he might not be diverted by the smallest
      obstacle from the execution of his great design. 10

      9 (return) [ Calapin, one of these royal infants, was saved from
      his cruel brother, and baptized at Rome under the name of
      Callistus Othomannus. The emperor Frederic III. presented him
      with an estate in Austria, where he ended his life; and
      Cuspinian, who in his youth conversed with the aged prince at
      Vienna, applauds his piety and wisdom, (de Cæsaribus, p. 672,
      673.)]

      901 (return) [ Ahmed, the son of a Greek princess, was the object
      of his especial jealousy. Von Hammer, p. 501.—M.]

      902 (return) [ The Janizaries obtained, for the first time, a
      gift on the accession of a new sovereign, p. 504.—M.]

      10 (return) [ See the accession of Mahomet II. in Ducas, (c. 33,)
      Phranza, (l. i. c. 33, l. iii. c. 2,) Chalcondyles, (l. vii. p.
      199,) and Cantemir, (p. 96.)]

      The Mahometan, and more especially the Turkish casuists, have
      pronounced that no promise can bind the faithful against the
      interest and duty of their religion; and that the sultan may
      abrogate his own treaties and those of his predecessors. The
      justice and magnanimity of Amurath had scorned this immoral
      privilege; but his son, though the proudest of men, could stoop
      from ambition to the basest arts of dissimulation and deceit.
      Peace was on his lips, while war was in his heart: he incessantly
      sighed for the possession of Constantinople; and the Greeks, by
      their own indiscretion, afforded the first pretence of the fatal
      rupture. 11 Instead of laboring to be forgotten, their
      ambassadors pursued his camp, to demand the payment, and even the
      increase, of their annual stipend: the divan was importuned by
      their complaints, and the vizier, a secret friend of the
      Christians, was constrained to deliver the sense of his brethren.
      “Ye foolish and miserable Romans,” said Calil, “we know your
      devices, and ye are ignorant of your own danger! The scrupulous
      Amurath is no more; his throne is occupied by a young conqueror,
      whom no laws can bind, and no obstacles can resist: and if you
      escape from his hands, give praise to the divine clemency, which
      yet delays the chastisement of your sins. Why do ye seek to
      affright us by vain and indirect menaces? Release the fugitive
      Orchan, crown him sultan of Romania; call the Hungarians from
      beyond the Danube; arm against us the nations of the West; and be
      assured, that you will only provoke and precipitate your ruin.”
      But if the fears of the ambassadors were alarmed by the stern
      language of the vizier, they were soothed by the courteous
      audience and friendly speeches of the Ottoman prince; and Mahomet
      assured them that on his return to Adrianople he would redress
      the grievances, and consult the true interests, of the Greeks. No
      sooner had he repassed the Hellespont, than he issued a mandate
      to suppress their pension, and to expel their officers from the
      banks of the Strymon: in this measure he betrayed a hostile mind;
      and the second order announced, and in some degree commenced, the
      siege of Constantinople. In the narrow pass of the Bosphorus, an
      Asiatic fortress had formerly been raised by his grandfather; in
      the opposite situation, on the European side, he resolved to
      erect a more formidable castle; and a thousand masons were
      commanded to assemble in the spring on a spot named Asomaton,
      about five miles from the Greek metropolis. 12 Persuasion is the
      resource of the feeble; and the feeble can seldom persuade: the
      ambassadors of the emperor attempted, without success, to divert
      Mahomet from the execution of his design. They represented, that
      his grandfather had solicited the permission of Manuel to build a
      castle on his own territories; but that this double
      fortification, which would command the strait, could only tend to
      violate the alliance of the nations; to intercept the Latins who
      traded in the Black Sea, and perhaps to annihilate the
      subsistence of the city. “I form no enterprise,” replied the
      perfidious sultan, “against the city; but the empire of
      Constantinople is measured by her walls. Have you forgot the
      distress to which my father was reduced when you formed a league
      with the Hungarians; when they invaded our country by land, and
      the Hellespont was occupied by the French galleys? Amurath was
      compelled to force the passage of the Bosphorus; and your
      strength was not equal to your malevolence. I was then a child at
      Adrianople; the Moslems trembled; and, for a while, the _Gabours_
      13 insulted our disgrace. But when my father had triumphed in the
      field of Warna, he vowed to erect a fort on the western shore,
      and that vow it is my duty to accomplish. Have ye the right, have
      ye the power, to control my actions on my own ground? For that
      ground is my own: as far as the shores of the Bosphorus, Asia is
      inhabited by the Turks, and Europe is deserted by the Romans.
      Return, and inform your king, that the present Ottoman is far
      different from his predecessors; that _his_ resolutions surpass
      _their_ wishes; and that _he_ performs more _than_ they could
      resolve. Return in safety—but the next who delivers a similar
      message may expect to be flayed alive.” After this declaration,
      Constantine, the first of the Greeks in spirit as in rank, 14 had
      determined to unsheathe the sword, and to resist the approach and
      establishment of the Turks on the Bosphorus. He was disarmed by
      the advice of his civil and ecclesiastical ministers, who
      recommended a system less generous, and even less prudent, than
      his own, to approve their patience and long-suffering, to brand
      the Ottoman with the name and guilt of an aggressor, and to
      depend on chance and time for their own safety, and the
      destruction of a fort which could not long be maintained in the
      neighborhood of a great and populous city. Amidst hope and fear,
      the fears of the wise, and the hopes of the credulous, the winter
      rolled away; the proper business of each man, and each hour, was
      postponed; and the Greeks shut their eyes against the impending
      danger, till the arrival of the spring and the sultan decide the
      assurance of their ruin.

      11 (return) [ Before I enter on the siege of Constantinople, I
      shall observe, that except the short hints of Cantemir and
      Leunclavius, I have not been able to obtain any Turkish account
      of this conquest; such an account as we possess of the siege of
      Rhodes by Soliman II., (Mémoires de l’Académie des Inscriptions,
      tom. xxvi. p. 723—769.) I must therefore depend on the Greeks,
      whose prejudices, in some degree, are subdued by their distress.
      Our standard texts ar those of Ducas, (c. 34—42,) Phranza, (l.
      iii. c. 7—20,) Chalcondyles, (l. viii. p. 201—214,) and Leonardus
      Chiensis, (Historia C. P. a Turco expugnatæ. Norimberghæ, 1544,
      in 4to., 20 leaves.) The last of these narratives is the earliest
      in date, since it was composed in the Isle of Chios, the 16th of
      August, 1453, only seventy-nine days after the loss of the city,
      and in the first confusion of ideas and passions. Some hints may
      be added from an epistle of Cardinal Isidore (in Farragine Rerum
      Turcicarum, ad calcem Chalcondyl. Clauseri, Basil, 1556) to Pope
      Nicholas V., and a tract of Theodosius Zygomala, which he
      addressed in the year 1581 to Martin Crucius, (Turco-Græcia, l.
      i. p. 74—98, Basil, 1584.) The various facts and materials are
      briefly, though critically, reviewed by Spondanus, (A.D. 1453,
      No. 1—27.) The hearsay relations of Monstrelet and the distant
      Latins I shall take leave to disregard. * Note: M. Von Hammer has
      added little new information on the siege of Constantinople, and,
      by his general agreement, has borne an honorable testimony to the
      truth, and by his close imitation to the graphic spirit and
      boldness, of Gibbon.—M.]

      12 (return) [ The situation of the fortress, and the topography
      of the Bosphorus, are best learned from Peter Gyllius, (de
      Bosphoro Thracio, l. ii. c. 13,) Leunclavius, (Pandect. p. 445,)
      and Tournefort, (Voyage dans le Levant, tom. ii. lettre xv. p.
      443, 444;) but I must regret the map or plan which Tournefort
      sent to the French minister of the marine. The reader may turn
      back to chap. xvii. of this History.]

      13 (return) [ The opprobrious name which the Turks bestow on the
      infidels, is expressed Kabour by Ducas, and _Giaour_ by
      Leunclavius and the moderns. The former term is derived by
      Ducange (Gloss. Græc tom. i. p. 530) from Kabouron, in vulgar
      Greek, a tortoise, as denoting a retrograde motion from the
      faith. But alas! _Gabour_ is no more than _Gheber_, which was
      transferred from the Persian to the Turkish language, from the
      worshippers of fire to those of the crucifix, (D’Herbelot,
      Bibliot. Orient. p. 375.)]

      14 (return) [ Phranza does justice to his master’s sense and
      courage. Calliditatem hominis non ignorans Imperator prior arma
      movere constituit, and stigmatizes the folly of the cum sacri tum
      profani proceres, which he had heard, amentes spe vanâ pasci.
      Ducas was not a privy-counsellor.]

      Of a master who never forgives, the orders are seldom disobeyed.
      On the twenty-sixth of March, the appointed spot of Asomaton was
      covered with an active swarm of Turkish artificers; and the
      materials by sea and land were diligently transported from Europe
      and Asia. 15 The lime had been burnt in Cataphrygia; the timber
      was cut down in the woods of Heraclea and Nicomedia; and the
      stones were dug from the Anatolian quarries. Each of the thousand
      masons was assisted by two workmen; and a measure of two cubits
      was marked for their daily task. The fortress 16 was built in a
      triangular form; each angle was flanked by a strong and massy
      tower; one on the declivity of the hill, two along the sea-shore:
      a thickness of twenty-two feet was assigned for the walls, thirty
      for the towers; and the whole building was covered with a solid
      platform of lead. Mahomet himself pressed and directed the work
      with indefatigable ardor: his three viziers claimed the honor of
      finishing their respective towers; the zeal of the cadhis
      emulated that of the Janizaries; the meanest labor was ennobled
      by the service of God and the sultan; and the diligence of the
      multitude was quickened by the eye of a despot, whose smile was
      the hope of fortune, and whose frown was the messenger of death.
      The Greek emperor beheld with terror the irresistible progress of
      the work; and vainly strove, by flattery and gifts, to assuage an
      implacable foe, who sought, and secretly fomented, the slightest
      occasion of a quarrel. Such occasions must soon and inevitably be
      found. The ruins of stately churches, and even the marble columns
      which had been consecrated to Saint Michael the archangel, were
      employed without scruple by the profane and rapacious Moslems;
      and some Christians, who presumed to oppose the removal, received
      from their hands the crown of martyrdom. Constantine had
      solicited a Turkish guard to protect the fields and harvests of
      his subjects: the guard was fixed; but their first order was to
      allow free pasture to the mules and horses of the camp, and to
      defend their brethren if they should be molested by the natives.
      The retinue of an Ottoman chief had left their horses to pass the
      night among the ripe corn; the damage was felt; the insult was
      resented; and several of both nations were slain in a tumultuous
      conflict. Mahomet listened with joy to the complaint; and a
      detachment was commanded to exterminate the guilty village: the
      guilty had fled; but forty innocent and unsuspecting reapers were
      massacred by the soldiers. Till this provocation, Constantinople
      had been opened to the visits of commerce and curiosity: on the
      first alarm, the gates were shut; but the emperor, still anxious
      for peace, released on the third day his Turkish captives; 17 and
      expressed, in a last message, the firm resignation of a Christian
      and a soldier. “Since neither oaths, nor treaty, nor submission,
      can secure peace, pursue,” said he to Mahomet, “your impious
      warfare. My trust is in God alone; if it should please him to
      mollify your heart, I shall rejoice in the happy change; if he
      delivers the city into your hands, I submit without a murmur to
      his holy will. But until the Judge of the earth shall pronounce
      between us, it is my duty to live and die in the defence of my
      people.” The sultan’s answer was hostile and decisive: his
      fortifications were completed; and before his departure for
      Adrianople, he stationed a vigilant Aga and four hundred
      Janizaries, to levy a tribute on the ships of every nation that
      should pass within the reach of their cannon. A Venetian vessel,
      refusing obedience to the new lords of the Bosphorus, was sunk
      with a single bullet. 171 The master and thirty sailors escaped
      in the boat; but they were dragged in chains to the _Porte_: the
      chief was impaled; his companions were beheaded; and the
      historian Ducas 18 beheld, at Demotica, their bodies exposed to
      the wild beasts. The siege of Constantinople was deferred till
      the ensuing spring; but an Ottoman army marched into the Morea to
      divert the force of the brothers of Constantine. At this æra of
      calamity, one of these princes, the despot Thomas, was blessed or
      afflicted with the birth of a son; “the last heir,” says the
      plaintive Phranza, “of the last spark of the Roman empire.” 19

      15 (return) [ Instead of this clear and consistent account, the
      Turkish Annals (Cantemir, p. 97) revived the foolish tale of the
      ox’s hide, and Dido’s stratagem in the foundation of Carthage.
      These annals (unless we are swayed by an anti-Christian
      prejudice) are far less valuable than the Greek historians.]

      16 (return) [ In the dimensions of this fortress, the old castle
      of Europe, Phranza does not exactly agree with Chalcondyles,
      whose description has been verified on the spot by his editor
      Leunclavius.]

      17 (return) [ Among these were some pages of Mahomet, so
      conscious of his inexorable rigor, that they begged to lose their

      The Greeks and the Turks passed an anxious and sleepless winter:
      the former were kept awake by their fears, the latter by their
      hopes; both by the preparations of defence and attack; and the
      two emperors, who had the most to lose or to gain, were the most
      deeply affected by the national sentiment. In Mahomet, that
      sentiment was inflamed by the ardor of his youth and temper: he
      amused his leisure with building at Adrianople 20 the lofty
      palace of Jehan Numa, (the watchtower of the world;) but his
      serious thoughts were irrevocably bent on the conquest of the
      city of Cæsar. At the dead of night, about the second watch, he
      started from his bed, and commanded the instant attendance of his
      prime vizier. The message, the hour, the prince, and his own
      situation, alarmed the guilty conscience of Calil Basha; who had
      possessed the confidence, and advised the restoration, of
      Amurath. On the accession of the son, the vizier was confirmed in
      his office and the appearances of favor; but the veteran
      statesman was not insensible that he trod on a thin and slippery
      ice, which might break under his footsteps, and plunge him in the
      abyss. His friendship for the Christians, which might be innocent
      under the late reign, had stigmatized him with the name of Gabour
      Ortachi, or foster-brother of the infidels; 21 and his avarice
      entertained a venal and treasonable correspondence, which was
      detected and punished after the conclusion of the war. On
      receiving the royal mandate, he embraced, perhaps for the last
      time, his wife and children; filled a cup with pieces of gold,
      hastened to the palace, adored the sultan, and offered, according
      to the Oriental custom, the slight tribute of his duty and
      gratitude. 22 “It is not my wish,” said Mahomet, “to resume my
      gifts, but rather to heap and multiply them on thy head. In my
      turn, I ask a present far more valuable and
      important;—Constantinople.” As soon as the vizier had recovered
      from his surprise, “The same God,” said he, “who has already
      given thee so large a portion of the Roman empire, will not deny
      the remnant, and the capital. His providence, and thy power,
      assure thy success; and myself, with the rest of thy faithful
      slaves, will sacrifice our lives and fortunes.”—“Lala,” 23 (or
      preceptor,) continued the sultan, “do you see this pillow? All
      the night, in my agitation, I have pulled it on one side and the
      other; I have risen from my bed, again have I lain down; yet
      sleep has not visited these weary eyes. Beware of the gold and
      silver of the Romans: in arms we are superior; and with the aid
      of God, and the prayers of the prophet, we shall speedily become
      masters of Constantinople.” To sound the disposition of his
      soldiers, he often wandered through the streets alone, and in
      disguise; and it was fatal to discover the sultan, when he wished
      to escape from the vulgar eye. His hours were spent in
      delineating the plan of the hostile city; in debating with his
      generals and engineers, on what spot he should erect his
      batteries; on which side he should assault the walls; where he
      should spring his mines; to what place he should apply his
      scaling-ladders: and the exercises of the day repeated and proved
      the lucubrations of the night.

      Chapter LXVIII: Reign Of Mahomet The Second, Extinction Of
      Eastern Empire.—Part II.

      Among the implements of destruction, he studied with peculiar
      care the recent and tremendous discovery of the Latins; and his
      artillery surpassed whatever had yet appeared in the world. A
      founder of cannon, a Dane 231 or Hungarian, who had been almost
      starved in the Greek service, deserted to the Moslems, and was
      liberally entertained by the Turkish sultan. Mahomet was
      satisfied with the answer to his first question, which he eagerly
      pressed on the artist. “Am I able to cast a cannon capable of
      throwing a ball or stone of sufficient size to batter the walls
      of Constantinople? I am not ignorant of their strength; but were
      they more solid than those of Babylon, I could oppose an engine
      of superior power: the position and management of that engine
      must be left to your engineers.” On this assurance, a foundry was
      established at Adrianople: the metal was prepared; and at the end
      of three months, Urban produced a piece of brass ordnance of
      stupendous, and almost incredible magnitude; a measure of twelve
      palms is assigned to the bore; and the stone bullet weighed above
      six hundred pounds. 24 241 A vacant place before the new palace
      was chosen for the first experiment; but to prevent the sudden
      and mischievous effects of astonishment and fear, a proclamation
      was issued, that the cannon would be discharged the ensuing day.
      The explosion was felt or heard in a circuit of a hundred
      furlongs: the ball, by the force of gunpowder, was driven above a
      mile; and on the spot where it fell, it buried itself a fathom
      deep in the ground. For the conveyance of this destructive
      engine, a frame or carriage of thirty wagons was linked together
      and drawn along by a team of sixty oxen: two hundred men on both
      sides were stationed, to poise and support the rolling weight;
      two hundred and fifty workmen marched before to smooth the way
      and repair the bridges; and near two months were employed in a
      laborious journey of one hundred and fifty miles. A lively
      philosopher 25 derides on this occasion the credulity of the
      Greeks, and observes, with much reason, that we should always
      distrust the exaggerations of a vanquished people. He calculates,
      that a ball, even of two hundred pounds, would require a charge
      of one hundred and fifty pounds of powder; and that the stroke
      would be feeble and impotent, since not a fifteenth part of the
      mass could be inflamed at the same moment. A stranger as I am to
      the art of destruction, I can discern that the modern
      improvements of artillery prefer the number of pieces to the
      weight of metal; the quickness of the fire to the sound, or even
      the consequence, of a single explosion. Yet I dare not reject the
      positive and unanimous evidence of contemporary writers; nor can
      it seem improbable, that the first artists, in their rude and
      ambitious efforts, should have transgressed the standard of
      moderation. A Turkish cannon, more enormous than that of Mahomet,
      still guards the entrance of the Dardanelles; and if the use be
      inconvenient, it has been found on a late trial that the effect
      was far from contemptible. A stone bullet of _eleven_ hundred
      pounds’ weight was once discharged with three hundred and thirty
      pounds of powder: at the distance of six hundred yards it
      shivered into three rocky fragments; traversed the strait; and
      leaving the waters in a foam, again rose and bounded against the
      opposite hill. 26

      While Mahomet threatened the capital of the East, the Greek
      emperor implored with fervent prayers the assistance of earth and
      heaven. But the invisible powers were deaf to his supplications;
      and Christendom beheld with indifference the fall of
      Constantinople, while she derived at least some promise of supply
      from the jealous and temporal policy of the sultan of Egypt. Some
      states were too weak, and others too remote; by some the danger
      was considered as imaginary by others as inevitable: the Western
      princes were involved in their endless and domestic quarrels; and
      the Roman pontiff was exasperated by the falsehood or obstinacy
      of the Greeks. Instead of employing in their favor the arms and
      treasures of Italy, Nicholas the Fifth had foretold their
      approaching ruin; and his honor was engaged in the accomplishment
      of his prophecy. 261 Perhaps he was softened by the last
      extremity of their distress; but his compassion was tardy; his
      efforts were faint and unavailing; and Constantinople had fallen,
      before the squadrons of Genoa and Venice could sail from their
      harbors. 27 Even the princes of the Morea and of the Greek
      islands affected a cold neutrality: the Genoese colony of Galata
      negotiated a private treaty; and the sultan indulged them in the
      delusive hope, that by his clemency they might survive the ruin
      of the empire. A plebeian crowd, and some Byzantine nobles basely
      withdrew from the danger of their country; and the avarice of the
      rich denied the emperor, and reserved for the Turks, the secret
      treasures which might have raised in their defence whole armies
      of mercenaries. 28 The indigent and solitary prince prepared,
      however, to sustain his formidable adversary; but if his courage
      were equal to the peril, his strength was inadequate to the
      contest. In the beginning of the spring, the Turkish vanguard
      swept the towns and villages as far as the gates of
      Constantinople: submission was spared and protected; whatever
      presumed to resist was exterminated with fire and sword. The
      Greek places on the Black Sea, Mesembria, Acheloum, and Bizon,
      surrendered on the first summons; Selybria alone deserved the
      honors of a siege or blockade; and the bold inhabitants, while
      they were invested by land, launched their boats, pillaged the
      opposite coast of Cyzicus, and sold their captives in the public
      market. But on the approach of Mahomet himself all was silent and
      prostrate: he first halted at the distance of five miles; and
      from thence advancing in battle array, planted before the gates
      of St. Romanus the Imperial standard; and on the sixth day of
      April formed the memorable siege of Constantinople.

      The troops of Asia and Europe extended on the right and left from
      the Propontis to the harbor; the Janizaries in the front were
      stationed before the sultan’s tent; the Ottoman line was covered
      by a deep intrenchment; and a subordinate army enclosed the
      suburb of Galata, and watched the doubtful faith of the Genoese.
      The inquisitive Philelphus, who resided in Greece about thirty
      years before the siege, is confident, that all the Turkish forces
      of any name or value could not exceed the number of sixty
      thousand horse and twenty thousand foot; and he upbraids the
      pusillanimity of the nations, who had tamely yielded to a handful
      of Barbarians. Such indeed might be the regular establishment of
      the _Capiculi_, 29 the troops of the Porte who marched with the
      prince, and were paid from his royal treasury. But the bashaws,
      in their respective governments, maintained or levied a
      provincial militia; many lands were held by a military tenure;
      many volunteers were attracted by the hope of spoil and the sound
      of the holy trumpet invited a swarm of hungry and fearless
      fanatics, who might contribute at least to multiply the terrors,
      and in a first attack to blunt the swords, of the Christians. The
      whole mass of the Turkish powers is magnified by Ducas,
      Chalcondyles, and Leonard of Chios, to the amount of three or
      four hundred thousand men; but Phranza was a less remote and more
      accurate judge; and his precise definition of two hundred and
      fifty-eight thousand does not exceed the measure of experience
      and probability. 30 The navy of the besiegers was less
      formidable: the Propontis was overspread with three hundred and
      twenty sail; but of these no more than eighteen could be rated as
      galleys of war; and the far greater part must be degraded to the
      condition of store-ships and transports, which poured into the
      camp fresh supplies of men, ammunition, and provisions. In her
      last decay, Constantinople was still peopled with more than a
      hundred thousand inhabitants; but these numbers are found in the
      accounts, not of war, but of captivity; and they mostly consisted
      of mechanics, of priests, of women, and of men devoid of that
      spirit which even women have sometimes exerted for the common
      safety. I can suppose, I could almost excuse, the reluctance of
      subjects to serve on a distant frontier, at the will of a tyrant;
      but the man who dares not expose his life in the defence of his
      children and his property, has lost in society the first and most
      active energies of nature. By the emperor’s command, a particular
      inquiry had been made through the streets and houses, how many of
      the citizens, or even of the monks, were able and willing to bear
      arms for their country. The lists were intrusted to Phranza; 31
      and, after a diligent addition, he informed his master, with
      grief and surprise, that the national defence was reduced to four
      thousand nine hundred and seventy _Romans_. Between Constantine
      and his faithful minister this comfortless secret was preserved;
      and a sufficient proportion of shields, cross-bows, and muskets,
      were distributed from the arsenal to the city bands. They derived
      some accession from a body of two thousand strangers, under the
      command of John Justiniani, a noble Genoese; a liberal donative
      was advanced to these auxiliaries; and a princely recompense, the
      Isle of Lemnos, was promised to the valor and victory of their
      chief. A strong chain was drawn across the mouth of the harbor:
      it was supported by some Greek and Italian vessels of war and
      merchandise; and the ships of every Christian nation, that
      successively arrived from Candia and the Black Sea, were detained
      for the public service. Against the powers of the Ottoman empire,
      a city of the extent of thirteen, perhaps of sixteen, miles was
      defended by a scanty garrison of seven or eight thousand
      soldiers. Europe and Asia were open to the besiegers; but the
      strength and provisions of the Greeks must sustain a daily
      decrease; nor could they indulge the expectation of any foreign
      succor or supply.

      has composed his military state of the Ottoman empire.]

      the Turks are much less numerous than they appear. In the army

      than 15,000 Janizaries.]

      national prejudices, we cannot desire a more authentic witness,
      not only of public facts, but of private counsels.]

      The primitive Romans would have drawn their swords in the
      resolution of death or conquest. The primitive Christians might
      have embraced each other, and awaited in patience and charity the
      stroke of martyrdom. But the Greeks of Constantinople were
      animated only by the spirit of religion, and that spirit was
      productive only of animosity and discord. Before his death, the
      emperor John Palæologus had renounced the unpopular measure of a
      union with the Latins; nor was the idea revived, till the
      distress of his brother Constantine imposed a last trial of
      flattery and dissimulation. 32 With the demand of temporal aid,
      his ambassadors were instructed to mingle the assurance of
      spiritual obedience: his neglect of the church was excused by the
      urgent cares of the state; and his orthodox wishes solicited the
      presence of a Roman legate. The Vatican had been too often
      deluded; yet the signs of repentance could not decently be
      overlooked; a legate was more easily granted than an army; and
      about six months before the final destruction, the cardinal
      Isidore of Russia appeared in that character with a retinue of
      priests and soldiers. The emperor saluted him as a friend and
      father; respectfully listened to his public and private sermons;
      and with the most obsequious of the clergy and laymen subscribed
      the act of union, as it had been ratified in the council of
      Florence. On the twelfth of December, the two nations, in the
      church of St. Sophia, joined in the communion of sacrifice and
      prayer; and the names of the two pontiffs were solemnly
      commemorated; the names of Nicholas the Fifth, the vicar of
      Christ, and of the patriarch Gregory, who had been driven into
      exile by a rebellious people.

      32 (return) [ In Spondanus, the narrative of the union is not
      only partial, but imperfect. The bishop of Pamiers died in 1642,
      and the history of Ducas, which represents these scenes (c. 36,
      37) with such truth and spirit, was not printed till the year
      1649.]

      But the dress and language of the Latin priest who officiated at
      the altar were an object of scandal; and it was observed with
      horror, that he consecrated a cake or wafer of _unleavened_
      bread, and poured cold water into the cup of the sacrament. A
      national historian acknowledges with a blush, that none of his
      countrymen, not the emperor himself, were sincere in this
      occasional conformity. 33 Their hasty and unconditional
      submission was palliated by a promise of future revisal; but the
      best, or the worst, of their excuses was the confession of their
      own perjury. When they were pressed by the reproaches of their
      honest brethren, “Have patience,” they whispered, “have patience
      till God shall have delivered the city from the great dragon who
      seeks to devour us. You shall then perceive whether we are truly
      reconciled with the Azymites.” But patience is not the attribute
      of zeal; nor can the arts of a court be adapted to the freedom
      and violence of popular enthusiasm. From the dome of St. Sophia
      the inhabitants of either sex, and of every degree, rushed in
      crowds to the cell of the monk Gennadius, 34 to consult the
      oracle of the church. The holy man was invisible; entranced, as
      it should seem, in deep meditation, or divine rapture: but he had
      exposed on the door of his cell a speaking tablet; and they
      successively withdrew, after reading those tremendous words: “O
      miserable Romans, why will ye abandon the truth? and why, instead
      of confiding in God, will ye put your trust in the Italians? In
      losing your faith you will lose your city. Have mercy on me, O
      Lord! I protest in thy presence that I am innocent of the crime.
      O miserable Romans, consider, pause, and repent. At the same
      moment that you renounce the religion of your fathers, by
      embracing impiety, you submit to a foreign servitude.” According
      to the advice of Gennadius, the religious virgins, as pure as
      angels, and as proud as dæmons, rejected the act of union, and
      abjured all communion with the present and future associates of
      the Latins; and their example was applauded and imitated by the
      greatest part of the clergy and people. From the monastery, the
      devout Greeks dispersed themselves in the taverns; drank
      confusion to the slaves of the pope; emptied their glasses in
      honor of the image of the holy Virgin; and besought her to defend
      against Mahomet the city which she had formerly saved from
      Chosroes and the Chagan. In the double intoxication of zeal and
      wine, they valiantly exclaimed, “What occasion have we for
      succor, or union, or Latins? Far from us be the worship of the
      Azymites!” During the winter that preceded the Turkish conquest,
      the nation was distracted by this epidemical frenzy; and the
      season of Lent, the approach of Easter, instead of breathing
      charity and love, served only to fortify the obstinacy and
      influence of the zealots. The confessors scrutinized and alarmed
      the conscience of their votaries, and a rigorous penance was
      imposed on those who had received the communion from a priest who
      had given an express or tacit consent to the union. His service
      at the altar propagated the infection to the mute and simple
      spectators of the ceremony: they forfeited, by the impure
      spectacle, the virtue of the sacerdotal character; nor was it
      lawful, even in danger of sudden death, to invoke the assistance
      of their prayers or absolution. No sooner had the church of St.
      Sophia been polluted by the Latin sacrifice, than it was deserted
      as a Jewish synagogue, or a heathen temple, by the clergy and
      people; and a vast and gloomy silence prevailed in that venerable
      dome, which had so often smoked with a cloud of incense, blazed
      with innumerable lights, and resounded with the voice of prayer
      and thanksgiving. The Latins were the most odious of heretics and
      infidels; and the first minister of the empire, the great duke,
      was heard to declare, that he had rather behold in Constantinople
      the turban of Mahomet, than the pope’s tiara or a cardinal’s hat.
      35 A sentiment so unworthy of Christians and patriots was
      familiar and fatal to the Greeks: the emperor was deprived of the
      affection and support of his subjects; and their native cowardice
      was sanctified by resignation to the divine decree, or the
      visionary hope of a miraculous deliverance.

      Of the triangle which composes the figure of Constantinople, the
      two sides along the sea were made inaccessible to an enemy; the
      Propontis by nature, and the harbor by art. Between the two
      waters, the basis of the triangle, the land side was protected by
      a double wall, and a deep ditch of the depth of one hundred feet.
      Against this line of fortification, which Phranza, an
      eye-witness, prolongs to the measure of six miles, 36 the
      Ottomans directed their principal attack; and the emperor, after
      distributing the service and command of the most perilous
      stations, undertook the defence of the external wall. In the
      first days of the siege the Greek soldiers descended into the
      ditch, or sallied into the field; but they soon discovered, that,
      in the proportion of their numbers, one Christian was of more
      value than twenty Turks: and, after these bold preludes, they
      were prudently content to maintain the rampart with their missile
      weapons. Nor should this prudence be accused of pusillanimity.
      The nation was indeed pusillanimous and base; but the last
      Constantine deserves the name of a hero: his noble band of
      volunteers was inspired with Roman virtue; and the foreign
      auxiliaries supported the honor of the Western chivalry. The
      incessant volleys of lances and arrows were accompanied with the
      smoke, the sound, and the fire, of their musketry and cannon.
      Their small arms discharged at the same time either five, or even
      ten, balls of lead, of the size of a walnut; and, according to
      the closeness of the ranks and the force of the powder, several
      breastplates and bodies were transpierced by the same shot. But
      the Turkish approaches were soon sunk in trenches, or covered
      with ruins. Each day added to the science of the Christians; but
      their inadequate stock of gunpowder was wasted in the operations
      of each day. Their ordnance was not powerful, either in size or
      number; and if they possessed some heavy cannon, they feared to
      plant them on the walls, lest the aged structure should be shaken
      and overthrown by the explosion. 37 The same destructive secret
      had been revealed to the Moslems; by whom it was employed with
      the superior energy of zeal, riches, and despotism. The great
      cannon of Mahomet has been separately noticed; an important and
      visible object in the history of the times: but that enormous
      engine was flanked by two fellows almost of equal magnitude: 38
      the long order of the Turkish artillery was pointed against the
      walls; fourteen batteries thundered at once on the most
      accessible places; and of one of these it is ambiguously
      expressed, that it was mounted with one hundred and thirty guns,
      or that it discharged one hundred and thirty bullets. Yet in the
      power and activity of the sultan, we may discern the infancy of
      the new science. Under a master who counted the moments, the
      great cannon could be loaded and fired no more than seven times
      in one day. 39 The heated metal unfortunately burst; several
      workmen were destroyed; and the skill of an artist 391 was
      admired who bethought himself of preventing the danger and the
      accident, by pouring oil, after each explosion, into the mouth of
      the cannon.

      p. 239.)]

      391 (return) [ The founder of the gun. Von Hammer, p. 526.]

      The first random shots were productive of more sound than effect;
      and it was by the advice of a Christian, that the engineers were
      taught to level their aim against the two opposite sides of the
      salient angles of a bastion. However imperfect, the weight and
      repetition of the fire made some impression on the walls; and the
      Turks, pushing their approaches to the edge of the ditch,
      attempted to fill the enormous chasm, and to build a road to the
      assault. 40 Innumerable fascines, and hogsheads, and trunks of
      trees, were heaped on each other; and such was the impetuosity of
      the throng, that the foremost and the weakest were pushed
      headlong down the precipice, and instantly buried under the
      accumulated mass. To fill the ditch was the toil of the
      besiegers; to clear away the rubbish was the safety of the
      besieged; and after a long and bloody conflict, the web that had
      been woven in the day was still unravelled in the night. The next
      resource of Mahomet was the practice of mines; but the soil was
      rocky; in every attempt he was stopped and undermined by the
      Christian engineers; nor had the art been yet invented of
      replenishing those subterraneous passages with gunpowder, and
      blowing whole towers and cities into the air. 41 A circumstance
      that distinguishes the siege of Constantinople is the reunion of
      the ancient and modern artillery. The cannon were intermingled
      with the mechanical engines for casting stones and darts; the
      bullet and the battering-ram 411 were directed against the same
      walls: nor had the discovery of gunpowder superseded the use of
      the liquid and unextinguishable fire. A wooden turret of the
      largest size was advanced on rollers; this portable magazine of
      ammunition and fascines was protected by a threefold covering of
      bulls’ hides: incessant volleys were securely discharged from the
      loop-holes; in the front, three doors were contrived for the
      alternate sally and retreat of the soldiers and workmen. They
      ascended by a staircase to the upper platform, and, as high as
      the level of that platform, a scaling-ladder could be raised by
      pulleys to form a bridge, and grapple with the adverse rampart.
      By these various arts of annoyance, some as new as they were
      pernicious to the Greeks, the tower of St. Romanus was at length
      overturned: after a severe struggle, the Turks were repulsed from
      the breach, and interrupted by darkness; but they trusted that
      with the return of light they should renew the attack with fresh
      vigor and decisive success. Of this pause of action, this
      interval of hope, each moment was improved, by the activity of
      the emperor and Justiniani, who passed the night on the spot, and
      urged the labors which involved the safety of the church and
      city. At the dawn of day, the impatient sultan perceived, with
      astonishment and grief, that his wooden turret had been reduced
      to ashes: the ditch was cleared and restored; and the tower of
      St. Romanus was again strong and entire. He deplored the failure
      of his design; and uttered a profane exclamation, that the word
      of the thirty-seven thousand prophets should not have compelled
      him to believe that such a work, in so short a time, could have
      been accomplished by the infidels.

      Chapter LXVIII: Reign Of Mahomet The Second, Extinction Of
      Eastern Empire.—Part III.

      The generosity of the Christian princes was cold and tardy; but
      in the first apprehension of a siege, Constantine had negotiated,
      in the isles of the Archipelago, the Morea, and Sicily, the most
      indispensable supplies. As early as the beginning of April, five
      42 great ships, equipped for merchandise and war, would have
      sailed from the harbor of Chios, had not the wind blown
      obstinately from the north. 43 One of these ships bore the
      Imperial flag; the remaining four belonged to the Genoese; and
      they were laden with wheat and barley, with wine, oil, and
      vegetables, and, above all, with soldiers and mariners for the
      service of the capital. After a tedious delay, a gentle breeze,
      and, on the second day, a strong gale from the south, carried
      them through the Hellespont and the Propontis: but the city was
      already invested by sea and land; and the Turkish fleet, at the
      entrance of the Bosphorus, was stretched from shore to shore, in
      the form of a crescent, to intercept, or at least to repel, these
      bold auxiliaries. The reader who has present to his mind the
      geographical picture of Constantinople, will conceive and admire
      the greatness of the spectacle. The five Christian ships
      continued to advance with joyful shouts, and a full press both of
      sails and oars, against a hostile fleet of three hundred vessels;
      and the rampart, the camp, the coasts of Europe and Asia, were
      lined with innumerable spectators, who anxiously awaited the
      event of this momentous succor. At the first view that event
      could not appear doubtful; the superiority of the Moslems was
      beyond all measure or account: and, in a calm, their numbers and
      valor must inevitably have prevailed. But their hasty and
      imperfect navy had been created, not by the genius of the people,
      but by the will of the sultan: in the height of their prosperity,
      the Turks have acknowledged, that if God had given them the
      earth, he had left the sea to the infidels; 44 and a series of
      defeats, a rapid progress of decay, has established the truth of
      their modest confession. Except eighteen galleys of some force,
      the rest of their fleet consisted of open boats, rudely
      constructed and awkwardly managed, crowded with troops, and
      destitute of cannon; and since courage arises in a great measure
      from the consciousness of strength, the bravest of the Janizaries
      might tremble on a new element. In the Christian squadron, five
      stout and lofty ships were guided by skilful pilots, and manned
      with the veterans of Italy and Greece, long practised in the arts
      and perils of the sea. Their weight was directed to sink or
      scatter the weak obstacles that impeded their passage: their
      artillery swept the waters: their liquid fire was poured on the
      heads of the adversaries, who, with the design of boarding,
      presumed to approach them; and the winds and waves are always on
      the side of the ablest navigators. In this conflict, the Imperial
      vessel, which had been almost overpowered, was rescued by the
      Genoese; but the Turks, in a distant and closer attack, were
      twice repulsed with considerable loss. Mahomet himself sat on
      horseback on the beach to encourage their valor by his voice and
      presence, by the promise of reward, and by fear more potent than
      the fear of the enemy. The passions of his soul, and even the
      gestures of his body, 45 seemed to imitate the actions of the
      combatants; and, as if he had been the lord of nature, he spurred
      his horse with a fearless and impotent effort into the sea. His
      loud reproaches, and the clamors of the camp, urged the Ottomans
      to a third attack, more fatal and bloody than the two former; and
      I must repeat, though I cannot credit, the evidence of Phranza,
      who affirms, from their own mouth, that they lost above twelve
      thousand men in the slaughter of the day. They fled in disorder
      to the shores of Europe and Asia, while the Christian squadron,
      triumphant and unhurt, steered along the Bosphorus, and securely
      anchored within the chain of the harbor. In the confidence of
      victory, they boasted that the whole Turkish power must have
      yielded to their arms; but the admiral, or captain bashaw, found
      some consolation for a painful wound in his eye, by representing
      that accident as the cause of his defeat. Balthi Ogli was a
      renegade of the race of the Bulgarian princes: his military
      character was tainted with the unpopular vice of avarice; and
      under the despotism of the prince or people, misfortune is a
      sufficient evidence of guilt. 451 His rank and services were
      annihilated by the displeasure of Mahomet. In the royal presence,
      the captain bashaw was extended on the ground by four slaves, and
      received one hundred strokes with a golden rod: 46 his death had
      been pronounced; and he adored the clemency of the sultan, who
      was satisfied with the milder punishment of confiscation and
      exile. The introduction of this supply revived the hopes of the
      Greeks, and accused the supineness of their Western allies.
      Amidst the deserts of Anatolia and the rocks of Palestine, the
      millions of the crusades had buried themselves in a voluntary and
      inevitable grave; but the situation of the Imperial city was
      strong against her enemies, and accessible to her friends; and a
      rational and moderate armament of the marine states might have
      saved the relics of the Roman name, and maintained a Christian
      fortress in the heart of the Ottoman empire. Yet this was the
      sole and feeble attempt for the deliverance of Constantinople:
      the more distant powers were insensible of its danger; and the
      ambassador of Hungary, or at least of Huniades, resided in the
      Turkish camp, to remove the fears, and to direct the operations,
      of the sultan. 47

      It was difficult for the Greeks to penetrate the secret of the
      divan; yet the Greeks are persuaded, that a resistance so
      obstinate and surprising, had fatigued the perseverance of
      Mahomet. He began to meditate a retreat; and the siege would have
      been speedily raised, if the ambition and jealousy of the second
      vizier had not opposed the perfidious advice of Calil Bashaw, who
      still maintained a secret correspondence with the Byzantine
      court. The reduction of the city appeared to be hopeless, unless
      a double attack could be made from the harbor as well as from the
      land; but the harbor was inaccessible: an impenetrable chain was
      now defended by eight large ships, more than twenty of a smaller
      size, with several galleys and sloops; and, instead of forcing
      this barrier, the Turks might apprehend a naval sally, and a
      second encounter in the open sea. In this perplexity, the genius
      of Mahomet conceived and executed a plan of a bold and marvellous
      cast, of transporting by land his lighter vessels and military
      stores from the Bosphorus into the higher part of the harbor. The
      distance is about ten 471 miles; the ground is uneven, and was
      overspread with thickets; and, as the road must be opened behind
      the suburb of Galata, their free passage or total destruction
      must depend on the option of the Genoese. But these selfish
      merchants were ambitious of the favor of being the last devoured;
      and the deficiency of art was supplied by the strength of
      obedient myriads. A level way was covered with a broad platform
      of strong and solid planks; and to render them more slippery and
      smooth, they were anointed with the fat of sheep and oxen.
      Fourscore light galleys and brigantines, of fifty and thirty
      oars, were disembarked on the Bosphorus shore; arranged
      successively on rollers; and drawn forwards by the power of men
      and pulleys. Two guides or pilots were stationed at the helm, and
      the prow, of each vessel: the sails were unfurled to the winds;
      and the labor was cheered by song and acclamation. In the course
      of a single night, this Turkish fleet painfully climbed the hill,
      steered over the plain, and was launched from the declivity into
      the shallow waters of the harbor, far above the molestation of
      the deeper vessels of the Greeks. The real importance of this
      operation was magnified by the consternation and confidence which
      it inspired: but the notorious, unquestionable fact was displayed
      before the eyes, and is recorded by the pens, of the two nations.
      48 A similar stratagem had been repeatedly practised by the
      ancients; 49 the Ottoman galleys (I must again repeat) should be
      considered as large boats; and, if we compare the magnitude and
      the distance, the obstacles and the means, the boasted miracle 50
      has perhaps been equalled by the industry of our own times. 51 As
      soon as Mahomet had occupied the upper harbor with a fleet and
      army, he constructed, in the narrowest part, a bridge, or rather
      mole, of fifty cubits in breadth, and one hundred in length: it
      was formed of casks and hogsheads; joined with rafters, linked
      with iron, and covered with a solid floor. On this floating
      battery he planted one of his largest cannon, while the fourscore
      galleys, with troops and scaling ladders, approached the most
      accessible side, which had formerly been stormed by the Latin
      conquerors. The indolence of the Christians has been accused for
      not destroying these unfinished works; 511 but their fire, by a
      superior fire, was controlled and silenced; nor were they wanting
      in a nocturnal attempt to burn the vessels as well as the bridge
      of the sultan. His vigilance prevented their approach; their
      foremost galiots were sunk or taken; forty youths, the bravest of
      Italy and Greece, were inhumanly massacred at his command; nor
      could the emperor’s grief be assuaged by the just though cruel
      retaliation, of exposing from the walls the heads of two hundred
      and sixty Mussulman captives. After a siege of forty days, the
      fate of Constantinople could no longer be averted. The diminutive
      garrison was exhausted by a double attack: the fortifications,
      which had stood for ages against hostile violence, were
      dismantled on all sides by the Ottoman cannon: many breaches were
      opened; and near the gate of St. Romanus, four towers had been
      levelled with the ground. For the payment of his feeble and
      mutinous troops, Constantine was compelled to despoil the
      churches with the promise of a fourfold restitution; and his
      sacrilege offered a new reproach to the enemies of the union. A
      spirit of discord impaired the remnant of the Christian strength;
      the Genoese and Venetian auxiliaries asserted the preeminence of
      their respective service; and Justiniani and the great duke,
      whose ambition was not extinguished by the common danger, accused
      each other of treachery and cowardice.

      During the siege of Constantinople, the words of peace and
      capitulation had been sometimes pronounced; and several embassies
      had passed between the camp and the city. 52 The Greek emperor
      was humbled by adversity; and would have yielded to any terms
      compatible with religion and royalty. The Turkish sultan was
      desirous of sparing the blood of his soldiers; still more
      desirous of securing for his own use the Byzantine treasures: and
      he accomplished a sacred duty in presenting to the _Gabours_ the
      choice of circumcision, of tribute, or of death. The avarice of
      Mahomet might have been satisfied with an annual sum of one
      hundred thousand ducats; but his ambition grasped the capital of
      the East: to the prince he offered a rich equivalent, to the
      people a free toleration, or a safe departure: but after some
      fruitless treaty, he declared his resolution of finding either a
      throne, or a grave, under the walls of Constantinople. A sense of
      honor, and the fear of universal reproach, forbade Palæologus to
      resign the city into the hands of the Ottomans; and he determined
      to abide the last extremities of war. Several days were employed
      by the sultan in the preparations of the assault; and a respite
      was granted by his favorite science of astrology, which had fixed
      on the twenty-ninth of May, as the fortunate and fatal hour. On
      the evening of the twenty-seventh, he issued his final orders;
      assembled in his presence the military chiefs, and dispersed his
      heralds through the camp to proclaim the duty, and the motives,
      of the perilous enterprise. Fear is the first principle of a
      despotic government; and his menaces were expressed in the
      Oriental style, that the fugitives and deserters, had they the
      wings of a bird, 53 should not escape from his inexorable
      justice. The greatest part of his bashaws and Janizaries were the
      offspring of Christian parents: but the glories of the Turkish
      name were perpetuated by successive adoption; and in the gradual
      change of individuals, the spirit of a legion, a regiment, or an
      _oda_, is kept alive by imitation and discipline. In this holy
      warfare, the Moslems were exhorted to purify their minds with
      prayer, their bodies with seven ablutions; and to abstain from
      food till the close of the ensuing day. A crowd of dervises
      visited the tents, to instil the desire of martyrdom, and the
      assurance of spending an immortal youth amidst the rivers and
      gardens of paradise, and in the embraces of the black-eyed
      virgins. Yet Mahomet principally trusted to the efficacy of
      temporal and visible rewards. A double pay was promised to the
      victorious troops: “The city and the buildings,” said Mahomet,
      “are mine; but I resign to your valor the captives and the spoil,
      the treasures of gold and beauty; be rich and be happy. Many are
      the provinces of my empire: the intrepid soldier who first
      ascends the walls of Constantinople shall be rewarded with the
      government of the fairest and most wealthy; and my gratitude
      shall accumulate his honors and fortunes above the measure of his
      own hopes.” Such various and potent motives diffused among the
      Turks a general ardor, regardless of life and impatient for
      action: the camp reechoed with the Moslem shouts of “God is God:
      there is but one God, and Mahomet is the apostle of God;” 54 and
      the sea and land, from Galata to the seven towers, were
      illuminated by the blaze of their nocturnal fires. 541

      52 (return) [ Chalcondyles and Ducas differ in the time and
      circumstances of the negotiation; and as it was neither glorious
      nor salutary, the faithful Phranza spares his prince even the
      thought of a surrender.]

      53 (return) [ These wings (Chalcondyles, l. viii. p. 208) are no
      more than an Oriental figure: but in the tragedy of Irene,
      Mahomet’s passion soars above sense and reason:—

               Should the fierce North, upon his frozen wings. Bear him
               aloft above the wondering clouds, And seat him in the
               Pleiads’ golden chariot— Then should my fury drag him
               down to tortures.

      Besides the extravagance of the rant, I must observe, 1. That the
      operation of the winds must be confined to the _lower_ region of
      the air. 2. That the name, etymology, and fable of the Pleiads
      are purely Greek, (Scholiast ad Homer, S. 686. Eudocia in Ioniâ,
      p. 399. Apollodor. l. iii. c. 10. Heyne, p. 229, Not. 682,) and

      des Arts, &c., tom. vi. p. 73—78. Gebelin, Hist. du Calendrier,

      exist either in science or fiction; but I much fear Dr. Johnson
      has confounded the Pleiads with the great bear or wagon, the
      zodiac with a northern constellation:—

      Far different was the state of the Christians; who, with loud and
      impotent complaints, deplored the guilt, or the punishment, of
      their sins. The celestial image of the Virgin had been exposed in
      solemn procession; but their divine patroness was deaf to their
      entreaties: they accused the obstinacy of the emperor for
      refusing a timely surrender; anticipated the horrors of their
      fate; and sighed for the repose and security of Turkish
      servitude. The noblest of the Greeks, and the bravest of the
      allies, were summoned to the palace, to prepare them, on the
      evening of the twenty-eighth, for the duties and dangers of the
      general assault. The last speech of Palæologus was the funeral
      oration of the Roman empire: 55 he promised, he conjured, and he
      vainly attempted to infuse the hope which was extinguished in his
      own mind. In this world all was comfortless and gloomy; and
      neither the gospel nor the church have proposed any conspicuous
      recompense to the heroes who fall in the service of their
      country. But the example of their prince, and the confinement of
      a siege, had armed these warriors with the courage of despair,
      and the pathetic scene is described by the feelings of the
      historian Phranza, who was himself present at this mournful
      assembly. They wept, they embraced; regardless of their families
      and fortunes, they devoted their lives; and each commander,
      departing to his station, maintained all night a vigilant and
      anxious watch on the rampart. The emperor, and some faithful
      companions, entered the dome of St. Sophia, which in a few hours
      was to be converted into a mosque; and devoutly received, with
      tears and prayers, the sacrament of the holy communion. He
      reposed some moments in the palace, which resounded with cries
      and lamentations; solicited the pardon of all whom he might have
      injured; 56 and mounted on horseback to visit the guards, and
      explore the motions of the enemy. The distress and fall of the
      last Constantine are more glorious than the long prosperity of
      the Byzantine Cæsars. 561

      55 (return) [ I am afraid that this discourse was composed by
      Phranza himself; and it smells so grossly of the sermon and the
      convent, that I almost doubt whether it was pronounced by
      Constantine. Leonardus assigns him another speech, in which he
      addresses himself more respectfully to the Latin auxiliaries.]

      56 (return) [ This abasement, which devotion has sometimes
      extorted from dying princes, is an improvement of the gospel
      doctrine of the forgiveness of injuries: it is more easy to
      forgive 490 times, than once to ask pardon of an inferior.]

      fall of Constantinople, translated by M. Boré, in the Journal

      of Le Beau, (tom. xxi. p. 308.) The author thus ends his poem:
      “I, Abraham, loaded with sins, have composed this elegy with the
      most lively sorrow; for I have seen Constantinople in the days of
      its glory.”—M.]

      In the confusion of darkness, an assailant may sometimes succeed;
      but in this great and general attack, the military judgment and
      astrological knowledge of Mahomet advised him to expect the
      morning, the memorable twenty-ninth of May, in the fourteen
      hundred and fifty-third year of the Christian æra. The preceding
      night had been strenuously employed: the troops, the cannons, and
      the fascines, were advanced to the edge of the ditch, which in
      many parts presented a smooth and level passage to the breach;
      and his fourscore galleys almost touched, with the prows and
      their scaling-ladders, the less defensible walls of the harbor.
      Under pain of death, silence was enjoined: but the physical laws
      of motion and sound are not obedient to discipline or fear; each
      individual might suppress his voice and measure his footsteps;
      but the march and labor of thousands must inevitably produce a
      strange confusion of dissonant clamors, which reached the ears of
      the watchmen of the towers. At daybreak, without the customary
      signal of the morning gun, the Turks assaulted the city by sea
      and land; and the similitude of a twined or twisted thread has
      been applied to the closeness and continuity of their line of
      attack. 57 The foremost ranks consisted of the refuse of the
      host, a voluntary crowd who fought without order or command; of
      the feebleness of age or childhood, of peasants and vagrants, and
      of all who had joined the camp in the blind hope of plunder and
      martyrdom. The common impulse drove them onwards to the wall; the
      most audacious to climb were instantly precipitated; and not a
      dart, not a bullet, of the Christians, was idly wasted on the
      accumulated throng. But their strength and ammunition were
      exhausted in this laborious defence: the ditch was filled with
      the bodies of the slain; they supported the footsteps of their
      companions; and of this devoted vanguard the death was more
      serviceable than the life. Under their respective bashaws and
      sanjaks, the troops of Anatolia and Romania were successively led
      to the charge: their progress was various and doubtful; but,
      after a conflict of two hours, the Greeks still maintained, and
      improved their advantage; and the voice of the emperor was heard,
      encouraging his soldiers to achieve, by a last effort, the
      deliverance of their country. In that fatal moment, the
      Janizaries arose, fresh, vigorous, and invincible. The sultan
      himself on horseback, with an iron mace in his hand, was the
      spectator and judge of their valor: he was surrounded by ten
      thousand of his domestic troops, whom he reserved for the
      decisive occasion; and the tide of battle was directed and
      impelled by his voice and eye. His numerous ministers of justice
      were posted behind the line, to urge, to restrain, and to punish;
      and if danger was in the front, shame and inevitable death were
      in the rear, of the fugitives. The cries of fear and of pain were
      drowned in the martial music of drums, trumpets, and attaballs;
      and experience has proved, that the mechanical operation of
      sounds, by quickening the circulation of the blood and spirits,
      will act on the human machine more forcibly than the eloquence of
      reason and honor. From the lines, the galleys, and the bridge,
      the Ottoman artillery thundered on all sides; and the camp and
      city, the Greeks and the Turks, were involved in a cloud of smoke
      which could only be dispelled by the final deliverance or
      destruction of the Roman empire. The single combats of the heroes
      of history or fable amuse our fancy and engage our affections:
      the skilful evolutions of war may inform the mind, and improve a
      necessary, though pernicious, science. But in the uniform and
      odious pictures of a general assault, all is blood, and horror,
      and confusion; nor shall I strive, at the distance of three
      centuries, and a thousand miles, to delineate a scene of which
      there could be no spectators, and of which the actors themselves
      were incapable of forming any just or adequate idea.

      57 (return) [ Besides the 10,000 guards, and the sailors and the
      marines, Ducas numbers in this general assault 250,000 Turks,
      both horse and foot.]

      The immediate loss of Constantinople may be ascribed to the
      bullet, or arrow, which pierced the gauntlet of John Justiniani.
      The sight of his blood, and the exquisite pain, appalled the
      courage of the chief, whose arms and counsels were the firmest
      rampart of the city. As he withdrew from his station in quest of
      a surgeon, his flight was perceived and stopped by the
      indefatigable emperor. “Your wound,” exclaimed Palæologus, “is
      slight; the danger is pressing: your presence is necessary; and
      whither will you retire?”—“I will retire,” said the trembling
      Genoese, “by the same road which God has opened to the Turks;”
      and at these words he hastily passed through one of the breaches
      of the inner wall. By this pusillanimous act he stained the
      honors of a military life; and the few days which he survived in
      Galata, or the Isle of Chios, were embittered by his own and the
      public reproach. 58 His example was imitated by the greatest part
      of the Latin auxiliaries, and the defence began to slacken when
      the attack was pressed with redoubled vigor. The number of the
      Ottomans was fifty, perhaps a hundred, times superior to that of
      the Christians; the double walls were reduced by the cannon to a
      heap of ruins: in a circuit of several miles, some places must be
      found more easy of access, or more feebly guarded; and if the
      besiegers could penetrate in a single point, the whole city was
      irrecoverably lost. The first who deserved the sultan’s reward
      was Hassan the Janizary, of gigantic stature and strength. With
      his cimeter in one hand and his buckler in the other, he ascended
      the outward fortification: of the thirty Janizaries, who were
      emulous of his valor, eighteen perished in the bold adventure.
      Hassan and his twelve companions had reached the summit: the
      giant was precipitated from the rampart: he rose on one knee, and
      was again oppressed by a shower of darts and stones. But his
      success had proved that the achievement was possible: the walls
      and towers were instantly covered with a swarm of Turks; and the
      Greeks, now driven from the vantage ground, were overwhelmed by
      increasing multitudes. Amidst these multitudes, the emperor, 59
      who accomplished all the duties of a general and a soldier, was
      long seen and finally lost. The nobles, who fought round his
      person, sustained, till their last breath, the honorable names of
      Palæologus and Cantacuzene: his mournful exclamation was heard,
      “Cannot there be found a Christian to cut off my head?” 60 and
      his last fear was that of falling alive into the hands of the
      infidels. 61 The prudent despair of Constantine cast away the
      purple: amidst the tumult he fell by an unknown hand, and his
      body was buried under a mountain of the slain. After his death,
      resistance and order were no more: the Greeks fled towards the
      city; and many were pressed and stifled in the narrow pass of the
      gate of St. Romanus. The victorious Turks rushed through the
      breaches of the inner wall; and as they advanced into the
      streets, they were soon joined by their brethren, who had forced
      the gate Phenar on the side of the harbor. 62 In the first heat
      of the pursuit, about two thousand Christians were put to the
      sword; but avarice soon prevailed over cruelty; and the victors
      acknowledged, that they should immediately have given quarter if
      the valor of the emperor and his chosen bands had not prepared
      them for a similar opposition in every part of the capital. It
      was thus, after a siege of fifty-three days, that Constantinople,
      which had defied the power of Chosroes, the Chagan, and the
      caliphs, was irretrievably subdued by the arms of Mahomet the
      Second. Her empire only had been subverted by the Latins: her
      religion was trampled in the dust by the Moslem conquerors. 63

      58 (return) [ In the severe censure of the flight of Justiniani,
      Phranza expresses his own feelings and those of the public. For
      some private reasons, he is treated with more lenity and respect
      by Ducas; but the words of Leonardus Chiensis express his strong
      and recent indignation, gloriæ salutis suique oblitus. In the
      whole series of their Eastern policy, his countrymen, the
      Genoese, were always suspected, and often guilty. * Note: M.
      Brosset has given some extracts from the Georgian account of the
      siege of Constantinople, in which Justiniani’s wound in the left
      foot is represented as more serious. With charitable ambiguity
      the chronicler adds that his soldiers carried him away with them
      in their vessel.—M.]

      escapes from the precise image of his death; but we may, without
      flattery, apply these noble lines of Dryden:—

               As to Sebastian, let them search the field; And where
               they find a mountain of the slain, Send one to climb,
               and looking down beneath, There they will find him at
               his manly length, With his face up to heaven, in that
               red monument Which his good sword had digged.]

      Turks, had they known the emperor, would have labored to save and

      Constantinople was sacked by the Asiatics in revenge for the
      ancient calamities of Troy; and the grammarians of the xvth
      century are happy to melt down the uncouth appellation of Turks
      into the more classical name of _Teucri_.]

      The tidings of misfortune fly with a rapid wing; yet such was the
      extent of Constantinople, that the more distant quarters might
      prolong, some moments, the happy ignorance of their ruin. 64 But
      in the general consternation, in the feelings of selfish or
      social anxiety, in the tumult and thunder of the assault, a
      _sleepless_ night and morning 641 must have elapsed; nor can I
      believe that many Grecian ladies were awakened by the Janizaries
      from a sound and tranquil slumber. On the assurance of the public
      calamity, the houses and convents were instantly deserted; and
      the trembling inhabitants flocked together in the streets, like a
      herd of timid animals, as if accumulated weakness could be
      productive of strength, or in the vain hope, that amid the crowd
      each individual might be safe and invisible. From every part of
      the capital, they flowed into the church of St. Sophia: in the
      space of an hour, the sanctuary, the choir, the nave, the upper
      and lower galleries, were filled with the multitudes of fathers
      and husbands, of women and children, of priests, monks, and
      religious virgins: the doors were barred on the inside, and they
      sought protection from the sacred dome, which they had so lately
      abhorred as a profane and polluted edifice. Their confidence was
      founded on the prophecy of an enthusiast or impostor; that one
      day the Turks would enter Constantinople, and pursue the Romans
      as far as the column of Constantine in the square before St.
      Sophia: but that this would be the term of their calamities: that
      an angel would descend from heaven, with a sword in his hand, and
      would deliver the empire, with that celestial weapon, to a poor
      man seated at the foot of the column. “Take this sword,” would he
      say, “and avenge the people of the Lord.” At these animating
      words, the Turks would instantly fly, and the victorious Romans
      would drive them from the West, and from all Anatolia as far as
      the frontiers of Persia. It is on this occasion that Ducas, with
      some fancy and much truth, upbraids the discord and obstinacy of
      the Greeks. “Had that angel appeared,” exclaims the historian,
      “had he offered to exterminate your foes if you would consent to
      the union of the church, even event then, in that fatal moment,
      you would have rejected your safety, or have deceived your God.”

      Chapter LXVIII: Reign Of Mahomet The Second, Extinction Of
      Eastern Empire.—Part IV.

      While they expected the descent of the tardy angel, the doors
      were broken with axes; and as the Turks encountered no
      resistance, their bloodless hands were employed in selecting and
      securing the multitude of their prisoners. Youth, beauty, and the
      appearance of wealth, attracted their choice; and the right of
      property was decided among themselves by a prior seizure, by
      personal strength, and by the authority of command. In the space
      of an hour, the male captives were bound with cords, the females
      with their veils and girdles. The senators were linked with their
      slaves; the prelates, with the porters of the church; and young
      men of the plebeian class, with noble maids, whose faces had been
      invisible to the sun and their nearest kindred. In this common
      captivity, the ranks of society were confounded; the ties of
      nature were cut asunder; and the inexorable soldier was careless
      of the father’s groans, the tears of the mother, and the
      lamentations of the children. The loudest in their wailings were
      the nuns, who were torn from the altar with naked bosoms,
      outstretched hands, and dishevelled hair; and we should piously
      believe that few could be tempted to prefer the vigils of the
      harem to those of the monastery. Of these unfortunate Greeks, of
      these domestic animals, whole strings were rudely driven through
      the streets; and as the conquerors were eager to return for more
      prey, their trembling pace was quickened with menaces and blows.
      At the same hour, a similar rapine was exercised in all the
      churches and monasteries, in all the palaces and habitations, of
      the capital; nor could any place, however sacred or sequestered,
      protect the persons or the property of the Greeks. Above sixty
      thousand of this devoted people were transported from the city to
      the camp and fleet; exchanged or sold according to the caprice or
      interest of their masters, and dispersed in remote servitude
      through the provinces of the Ottoman empire. Among these we may
      notice some remarkable characters. The historian Phranza, first
      chamberlain and principal secretary, was involved with his family
      in the common lot. After suffering four months the hardships of
      slavery, he recovered his freedom: in the ensuing winter he
      ventured to Adrianople, and ransomed his wife from the _mir
      bashi_, or master of the horse; but his two children, in the
      flower of youth and beauty, had been seized for the use of
      Mahomet himself. The daughter of Phranza died in the seraglio,
      perhaps a virgin: his son, in the fifteenth year of his age,
      preferred death to infamy, and was stabbed by the hand of the
      royal lover. 66 A deed thus inhuman cannot surely be expiated by
      the taste and liberality with which he released a Grecian matron
      and her two daughters, on receiving a Latin doe From ode from
      Philelphus, who had chosen a wife in that noble family. 67 The
      pride or cruelty of Mahomet would have been most sensibly
      gratified by the capture of a Roman legate; but the dexterity of
      Cardinal Isidore eluded the search, and he escaped from Galata in
      a plebeian habit. 68 The chain and entrance of the outward harbor
      was still occupied by the Italian ships of merchandise and war.
      They had signalized their valor in the siege: they embraced the
      moment of retreat, while the Turkish mariners were dissipated in
      the pillage of the city. When they hoisted sail, the beach was
      covered with a suppliant and lamentable crowd; but the means of
      transportation were scanty: the Venetians and Genoese selected
      their countrymen; and, notwithstanding the fairest promises of
      the sultan, the inhabitants of Galata evacuated their houses, and
      embarked with their most precious effects.

      66 (return) [ See Phranza, l. iii. c. 20, 21. His expressions are
      positive: Ameras suâ manû jugulavit.... volebat enim eo turpiter

      68 (return) [ The commentaries of Pius II. suppose that he
      craftily placed his cardinal’s hat on the head of a corpse which
      was cut off and exposed in triumph, while the legate himself was
      bought and delivered as a captive of no value. The great Belgic
      Chronicle adorns his escape with new adventures, which he
      suppressed (says Spondanus, A.D. 1453, No. 15) in his own
      letters, lest he should lose the merit and reward of suffering
      for Christ. * Note: He was sold as a slave in Galata, according
      to Von Hammer, p. 175. See the somewhat vague and declamatory
      letter of Cardinal Isidore, in the appendix to Clarke’s Travels,
      vol. ii. p. 653.—M.]

      In the fall and the sack of great cities, an historian is
      condemned to repeat the tale of uniform calamity: the same
      effects must be produced by the same passions; and when those
      passions may be indulged without control, small, alas! is the
      difference between civilized and savage man. Amidst the vague
      exclamations of bigotry and hatred, the Turks are not accused of
      a wanton or immoderate effusion of Christian blood: but according
      to their maxims, (the maxims of antiquity,) the lives of the
      vanquished were forfeited; and the legitimate reward of the
      conqueror was derived from the service, the sale, or the ransom,
      of his captives of both sexes. 69 The wealth of Constantinople
      had been granted by the sultan to his victorious troops; and the
      rapine of an hour is more productive than the industry of years.
      But as no regular division was attempted of the spoil, the
      respective shares were not determined by merit; and the rewards
      of valor were stolen away by the followers of the camp, who had
      declined the toil and danger of the battle. The narrative of
      their depredations could not afford either amusement or
      instruction: the total amount, in the last poverty of the empire,
      has been valued at four millions of ducats; 70 and of this sum a
      small part was the property of the Venetians, the Genoese, the
      Florentines, and the merchants of Ancona. Of these foreigners,
      the stock was improved in quick and perpetual circulation: but
      the riches of the Greeks were displayed in the idle ostentation
      of palaces and wardrobes, or deeply buried in treasures of ingots
      and old coin, lest it should be demanded at their hands for the
      defence of their country. The profanation and plunder of the
      monasteries and churches excited the most tragic complaints. The
      dome of St. Sophia itself, the earthly heaven, the second
      firmament, the vehicle of the cherubim, the throne of the glory
      of God, 71 was despoiled of the oblation of ages; and the gold
      and silver, the pearls and jewels, the vases and sacerdotal
      ornaments, were most wickedly converted to the service of
      mankind. After the divine images had been stripped of all that
      could be valuable to a profane eye, the canvas, or the wood, was
      torn, or broken, or burnt, or trod under foot, or applied, in the
      stables or the kitchen, to the vilest uses. The example of
      sacrilege was imitated, however, from the Latin conquerors of
      Constantinople; and the treatment which Christ, the Virgin, and
      the saints, had sustained from the guilty Catholic, might be
      inflicted by the zealous Mussulman on the monuments of idolatry.
      Perhaps, instead of joining the public clamor, a philosopher will
      observe, that in the decline of the arts the workmanship could
      not be more valuable than the work, and that a fresh supply of
      visions and miracles would speedily be renewed by the craft of
      the priests and the credulity of the people. He will more
      seriously deplore the loss of the Byzantine libraries, which were
      destroyed or scattered in the general confusion: one hundred and
      twenty thousand manuscripts are said to have disappeared; 72 ten
      volumes might be purchased for a single ducat; and the same
      ignominious price, too high perhaps for a shelf of theology,
      included the whole works of Aristotle and Homer, the noblest
      productions of the science and literature of ancient Greece. We
      may reflect with pleasure that an inestimable portion of our
      classic treasures was safely deposited in Italy; and that the
      mechanics of a German town had invented an art which derides the
      havoc of time and barbarism.

      From the first hour 73 of the memorable twenty-ninth of May,
      disorder and rapine prevailed in Constantinople, till the eighth
      hour of the same day; when the sultan himself passed in triumph
      through the gate of St. Romanus. He was attended by his viziers,
      bashaws, and guards, each of whom (says a Byzantine historian)
      was robust as Hercules, dexterous as Apollo, and equal in battle
      to any ten of the race of ordinary mortals. The conqueror 74
      gazed with satisfaction and wonder on the strange, though
      splendid, appearance of the domes and palaces, so dissimilar from
      the style of Oriental architecture. In the hippodrome, or
      _atmeidan_, his eye was attracted by the twisted column of the
      three serpents; and, as a trial of his strength, he shattered
      with his iron mace or battle-axe the under jaw of one of these
      monsters, 75 which in the eyes of the Turks were the idols or
      talismans of the city. 751 At the principal door of St. Sophia,
      he alighted from his horse, and entered the dome; and such was
      his jealous regard for that monument of his glory, that on
      observing a zealous Mussulman in the act of breaking the marble
      pavement, he admonished him with his cimeter, that, if the spoil
      and captives were granted to the soldiers, the public and private
      buildings had been reserved for the prince. By his command the
      metropolis of the Eastern church was transformed into a mosque:
      the rich and portable instruments of superstition had been
      removed; the crosses were thrown down; and the walls, which were
      covered with images and mosaics, were washed and purified, and
      restored to a state of naked simplicity. On the same day, or on
      the ensuing Friday, the _muezin_, or crier, ascended the most
      lofty turret, and proclaimed the _ezan_, or public invitation in
      the name of God and his prophet; the imam preached; and Mahomet
      and Second performed the _namaz_ of prayer and thanksgiving on
      the great altar, where the Christian mysteries had so lately been
      celebrated before the last of the Cæsars. 76 From St. Sophia he
      proceeded to the august, but desolate mansion of a hundred
      successors of the great Constantine, but which in a few hours had
      been stripped of the pomp of royalty. A melancholy reflection on
      the vicissitudes of human greatness forced itself on his mind;
      and he repeated an elegant distich of Persian poetry: “The spider
      has wove his web in the Imperial palace; and the owl hath sung
      her watch-song on the towers of Afrasiab.” 77

      Homer. The same generous feeling carried the mind of the
      conqueror to the past or the future.]

      Yet his mind was not satisfied, nor did the victory seem
      complete, till he was informed of the fate of Constantine;
      whether he had escaped, or been made prisoner, or had fallen in
      the battle. Two Janizaries claimed the honor and reward of his
      death: the body, under a heap of slain, was discovered by the
      golden eagles embroidered on his shoes; the Greeks acknowledged,
      with tears, the head of their late emperor; and, after exposing
      the bloody trophy, 78 Mahomet bestowed on his rival the honors of
      a decent funeral. After his decease, Lucas Notaras, great duke,
      79 and first minister of the empire, was the most important
      prisoner. When he offered his person and his treasures at the
      foot of the throne, “And why,” said the indignant sultan, “did
      you not employ these treasures in the defence of your prince and
      country?”—“They were yours,” answered the slave; “God had
      reserved them for your hands.”—“If he reserved them for me,”
      replied the despot, “how have you presumed to withhold them so
      long by a fruitless and fatal resistance?” The great duke alleged
      the obstinacy of the strangers, and some secret encouragement
      from the Turkish vizier; and from this perilous interview he was
      at length dismissed with the assurance of pardon and protection.
      Mahomet condescended to visit his wife, a venerable princess
      oppressed with sickness and grief; and his consolation for her
      misfortunes was in the most tender strain of humanity and filial
      reverence. A similar clemency was extended to the principal
      officers of state, of whom several were ransomed at his expense;
      and during some days he declared himself the friend and father of
      the vanquished people. But the scene was soon changed; and before
      his departure, the hippodrome streamed with the blood of his
      noblest captives. His perfidious cruelty is execrated by the
      Christians: they adorn with the colors of heroic martyrdom the
      execution of the great duke and his two sons; and his death is
      ascribed to the generous refusal of delivering his children to
      the tyrant’s lust. 791 Yet a Byzantine historian has dropped an
      unguarded word of conspiracy, deliverance, and Italian succor:
      such treason may be glorious; but the rebel who bravely ventures,
      has justly forfeited his life; nor should we blame a conqueror
      for destroying the enemies whom he can no longer trust. On the
      eighteenth of June the victorious sultan returned to Adrianople;
      and smiled at the base and hollow embassies of the Christian
      princes, who viewed their approaching ruin in the fall of the
      Eastern empire.

      78 (return) [ I cannot believe with Ducas (see Spondanus, A.D.

      trophy less inhuman.]

      indebted to him for the hint of the Greek conspiracy.]

      791 (return) [ Von Hammer relates this undoubtingly, apparently
      on good authority, p. 559.—M.]

      Constantinople had been left naked and desolate, without a prince
      or a people. But she could not be despoiled of the incomparable
      situation which marks her for the metropolis of a great empire;
      and the genius of the place will ever triumph over the accidents
      of time and fortune. Boursa and Adrianople, the ancient seats of
      the Ottomans, sunk into provincial towns; and Mahomet the Second
      established his own residence, and that of his successors, on the
      same commanding spot which had been chosen by Constantine. 80 The
      fortifications of Galata, which might afford a shelter to the
      Latins, were prudently destroyed; but the damage of the Turkish
      cannon was soon repaired; and before the month of August, great
      quantities of lime had been burnt for the restoration of the
      walls of the capital. As the entire property of the soil and
      buildings, whether public or private, or profane or sacred, was
      now transferred to the conqueror, he first separated a space of
      eight furlongs from the point of the triangle for the
      establishment of his seraglio or palace. It is here, in the bosom
      of luxury, that the _Grand Signor_ (as he has been emphatically
      named by the Italians) appears to reign over Europe and Asia; but
      his person on the shores of the Bosphorus may not always be
      secure from the insults of a hostile navy. In the new character
      of a mosque, the cathedral of St. Sophia was endowed with an
      ample revenue, crowned with lofty minarets, and surrounded with
      groves and fountains, for the devotion and refreshment of the
      Moslems. The same model was imitated in the _jami_, or royal
      mosques; and the first of these was built, by Mahomet himself, on
      the ruins of the church of the holy apostles, and the tombs of
      the Greek emperors. On the third day after the conquest, the
      grave of Abu Ayub, or Job, who had fallen in the first siege of
      the Arabs, was revealed in a vision; and it is before the
      sepulchre of the martyr that the new sultans are girded with the
      sword of empire. 81 Constantinople no longer appertains to the
      Roman historian; nor shall I enumerate the civil and religious
      edifices that were profaned or erected by its Turkish masters:
      the population was speedily renewed; and before the end of
      September, five thousand families of Anatolia and Romania had
      obeyed the royal mandate, which enjoined them, under pain of
      death, to occupy their new habitations in the capital. The throne
      of Mahomet was guarded by the numbers and fidelity of his Moslem
      subjects: but his rational policy aspired to collect the remnant
      of the Greeks; and they returned in crowds, as soon as they were
      assured of their lives, their liberties, and the free exercise of
      their religion. In the election and investiture of a patriarch,
      the ceremonial of the Byzantine court was revived and imitated.
      With a mixture of satisfaction and horror, they beheld the sultan
      on his throne; who delivered into the hands of Gennadius the
      crosier or pastoral staff, the symbol of his ecclesiastical
      office; who conducted the patriarch to the gate of the seraglio,
      presented him with a horse richly caparisoned, and directed the
      viziers and bashaws to lead him to the palace which had been
      allotted for his residence. 82 The churches of Constantinople
      were shared between the two religions: their limits were marked;
      and, till it was infringed by Selim, the grandson of Mahomet, the
      Greeks 83 enjoyed above sixty years the benefit of this equal
      partition. Encouraged by the ministers of the divan, who wished
      to elude the fanaticism of the sultan, the Christian advocates
      presumed to allege that this division had been an act, not of
      generosity, but of justice; not a concession, but a compact; and
      that if one half of the city had been taken by storm, the other
      moiety had surrendered on the faith of a sacred capitulation. The
      original grant had indeed been consumed by fire: but the loss was
      supplied by the testimony of three aged Janizaries who remembered
      the transaction; and their venal oaths are of more weight in the
      opinion of Cantemir, than the positive and unanimous consent of
      the history of the times. 84

      taking of Constantinople, inserted in the Turco-Græcia of
      Crusius, (l. v. p. 106—184.) But the most patient reader will not

      84 (return) [ Cantemir (p. 101—105) insists on the unanimous

      argues, that they would not have violated the truth to diminish
      their national glory, since it is esteemed more honorable to take
      a city by force than by composition. But, 1. I doubt this
      consent, since he quotes no particular historian, and the Turkish
      Annals of Leunclavius affirm, without exception, that Mahomet
      took Constantinople _per vim_, (p. 329.) 2 The same argument may
      be turned in favor of the Greeks of the times, who would not have
      forgotten this honorable and salutary treaty. Voltaire, as usual,
      prefers the Turks to the Christians.]

      The remaining fragments of the Greek kingdom in Europe and Asia I
      shall abandon to the Turkish arms; but the final extinction of
      the two last dynasties 85 which have reigned in Constantinople
      should terminate the decline and fall of the Roman empire in the
      East. The despots of the Morea, Demetrius and Thomas, 86 the two
      surviving brothers of the name of Palæologus, were astonished by
      the death of the emperor Constantine, and the ruin of the
      monarchy. Hopeless of defence, they prepared, with the noble
      Greeks who adhered to their fortune, to seek a refuge in Italy,
      beyond the reach of the Ottoman thunder. Their first
      apprehensions were dispelled by the victorious sultan, who
      contented himself with a tribute of twelve thousand ducats; and
      while his ambition explored the continent and the islands, in
      search of prey, he indulged the Morea in a respite of seven
      years. But this respite was a period of grief, discord, and
      misery. The _hexamilion_, the rampart of the Isthmus, so often
      raised and so often subverted, could not long be defended by
      three hundred Italian archers: the keys of Corinth were seized by
      the Turks: they returned from their summer excursions with a
      train of captives and spoil; and the complaints of the injured
      Greeks were heard with indifference and disdain. The Albanians, a
      vagrant tribe of shepherds and robbers, filled the peninsula with
      rapine and murder: the two despots implored the dangerous and
      humiliating aid of a neighboring bashaw; and when he had quelled
      the revolt, his lessons inculcated the rule of their future
      conduct. Neither the ties of blood, nor the oaths which they
      repeatedly pledged in the communion and before the altar, nor the
      stronger pressure of necessity, could reconcile or suspend their
      domestic quarrels. They ravaged each other’s patrimony with fire
      and sword: the alms and succors of the West were consumed in
      civil hostility; and their power was only exerted in savage and
      arbitrary executions. The distress and revenge of the weaker
      rival invoked their supreme lord; and, in the season of maturity
      and revenge, Mahomet declared himself the friend of Demetrius,
      and marched into the Morea with an irresistible force. When he
      had taken possession of Sparta, “You are too weak,” said the
      sultan, “to control this turbulent province: I will take your
      daughter to my bed; and you shall pass the remainder of your life
      in security and honor.” Demetrius sighed and obeyed; surrendered
      his daughter and his castles; followed to Adrianople his
      sovereign and his son; and received for his own maintenance, and
      that of his followers, a city in Thrace and the adjacent isles of
      Imbros, Lemnos, and Samothrace. He was joined the next year by a
      companion 861 of misfortune, the last of the Comnenian race, who,
      after the taking of Constantinople by the Latins, had founded a
      new empire on the coast of the Black Sea. 87 In the progress of
      his Anatolian conquest, Mahomet invested with a fleet and army
      the capital of David, who presumed to style himself emperor of
      Trebizond; 88 and the negotiation was comprised in a short and
      peremptory question, “Will you secure your life and treasures by
      resigning your kingdom? or had you rather forfeit your kingdom,
      your treasures, and your life?” The feeble Comnenus was subdued
      by his own fears, 881 and the example of a Mussulman neighbor,
      the prince of Sinope, 89 who, on a similar summons, had yielded a
      fortified city, with four hundred cannon and ten or twelve
      thousand soldiers. The capitulation of Trebizond was faithfully
      performed: 891 and the emperor, with his family, was transported
      to a castle in Romania; but on a slight suspicion of
      corresponding with the Persian king, David, and the whole
      Comnenian race, were sacrificed to the jealousy or avarice of the
      conqueror. 892 Nor could the name of father long protect the
      unfortunate Demetrius from exile and confiscation; his abject
      submission moved the pity and contempt of the sultan; his
      followers were transplanted to Constantinople; and his poverty
      was alleviated by a pension of fifty thousand aspers, till a
      monastic habit and a tardy death released Palæologus from an
      earthly master. It is not easy to pronounce whether the servitude
      of Demetrius, or the exile of his brother Thomas, 90 be the most
      inglorious. On the conquest of the Morea, the despot escaped to
      Corfu, and from thence to Italy, with some naked adherents: his
      name, his sufferings, and the head of the apostle St. Andrew,
      entitled him to the hospitality of the Vatican; and his misery
      was prolonged by a pension of six thousand ducats from the pope
      and cardinals. His two sons, Andrew and Manuel, were educated in
      Italy; but the eldest, contemptible to his enemies and burdensome
      to his friends, was degraded by the baseness of his life and
      marriage. A title was his sole inheritance; and that inheritance
      he successively sold to the kings of France and Arragon. 91
      During his transient prosperity, Charles the Eighth was ambitious
      of joining the empire of the East with the kingdom of Naples: in
      a public festival, he assumed the appellation and the purple of
      _Augustus_: the Greeks rejoiced and the Ottoman already trembled,
      at the approach of the French chivalry. 92 Manuel Palæologus, the
      second son, was tempted to revisit his native country: his return
      might be grateful, and could not be dangerous, to the Porte: he
      was maintained at Constantinople in safety and ease; and an
      honorable train of Christians and Moslems attended him to the
      grave. If there be some animals of so generous a nature that they

      race must be ascribed to an inferior kind: he accepted from the
      sultan’s liberality two beautiful females; and his surviving son
      was lost in the habit and religion of a Turkish slave.

      rise, 60 miles of an easy navigation, eighteen days’ journey from
      Valona to Constantinople, &c. On this occasion the Turkish empire
      was saved by the policy of Venice.]

      The importance of Constantinople was felt and magnified in its
      loss: the pontificate of Nicholas the Fifth, however peaceful and
      prosperous, was dishonored by the fall of the Eastern empire; and
      the grief and terror of the Latins revived, or seemed to revive,
      the old enthusiasm of the crusades. In one of the most distant
      countries of the West, Philip duke of Burgundy entertained, at
      Lisle in Flanders, an assembly of his nobles; and the pompous
      pageants of the feast were skilfully adapted to their fancy and
      feelings. 93 In the midst of the banquet a gigantic Saracen
      entered the hall, leading a fictitious elephant with a castle on
      his back: a matron in a mourning robe, the symbol of religion,
      was seen to issue from the castle: she deplored her oppression,
      and accused the slowness of her champions: the principal herald
      of the golden fleece advanced, bearing on his fist a live
      pheasant, which, according to the rites of chivalry, he presented
      to the duke. At this extraordinary summons, Philip, a wise and
      aged prince, engaged his person and powers in the holy war
      against the Turks: his example was imitated by the barons and
      knights of the assembly: they swore to God, the Virgin, the
      ladies and the _pheasant_; and their particular vows were not
      less extravagant than the general sanction of their oath. But the
      performance was made to depend on some future and foreign
      contingency; and during twelve years, till the last hour of his
      life, the duke of Burgundy might be scrupulously, and perhaps
      sincerely, on the eve of his departure. Had every breast glowed
      with the same ardor; had the union of the Christians corresponded
      with their bravery; had every country, from Sweden 94 to Naples,
      supplied a just proportion of cavalry and infantry, of men and
      money, it is indeed probable that Constantinople would have been
      delivered, and that the Turks might have been chased beyond the
      Hellespont or the Euphrates. But the secretary of the emperor,
      who composed every epistle, and attended every meeting, Æneas
      Sylvius, 95 a statesman and orator, describes from his own
      experience the repugnant state and spirit of Christendom. “It is
      a body,” says he, “without a head; a republic without laws or
      magistrates. The pope and the emperor may shine as lofty titles,
      as splendid images; but _they_ are unable to command, and none
      are willing to obey: every state has a separate prince, and every
      prince has a separate interest. What eloquence could unite so
      many discordant and hostile powers under the same standard? Could
      they be assembled in arms, who would dare to assume the office of
      general? What order could be maintained?—what military
      discipline? Who would undertake to feed such an enormous
      multitude? Who would understand their various languages, or
      direct their stranger and incompatible manners? What mortal could
      reconcile the Germans with the French, Genoa with Arragon, the
      Germans with the natives of Hungary and Bohemia? If a small
      number enlisted in the holy war, they must be overthrown by the
      infidels; if many, by their own weight and confusion.” Yet the
      same Æneas, when he was raised to the papal throne, under the
      name of Pius the Second, devoted his life to the prosecution of
      the Turkish war. In the council of Mantua he excited some sparks
      of a false or feeble enthusiasm; but when the pontiff appeared at
      Ancona, to embark in person with the troops, engagements vanished
      in excuses; a precise day was adjourned to an indefinite term;
      and his effective army consisted of some German pilgrims, whom he
      was obliged to disband with indulgences and arms. Regardless of
      futurity, his successors and the powers of Italy were involved in
      the schemes of present and domestic ambition; and the distance or
      proximity of each object determined in their eyes its apparent
      magnitude. A more enlarged view of their interest would have
      taught them to maintain a defensive and naval war against the
      common enemy; and the support of Scanderbeg and his brave
      Albanians might have prevented the subsequent invasion of the
      kingdom of Naples. The siege and sack of Otranto by the Turks
      diffused a general consternation; and Pope Sixtus was preparing
      to fly beyond the Alps, when the storm was instantly dispelled by
      the death of Mahomet the Second, in the fifty-first year of his
      age. 96 His lofty genius aspired to the conquest of Italy: he was
      possessed of a strong city and a capacious harbor; and the same
      reign might have been decorated with the trophies of the New and
      the Ancient Rome. 97

      of M. de Ste. Palaye, (Mémoires sur la Chevalerie, tom. i. P.

      observations. That valuable annalist, and the Italian Muratori,
      will continue the series of events from the year 1453 to 1481,
      the end of Mahomet’s life, and of this chapter.]

      96 (return) [ Besides the two annalists, the reader may consult
      Giannone (Istoria Civile, tom. iii. p. 449—455) for the Turkish
      invasion of the kingdom of Naples. For the reign and conquests of
      Mahomet II., I have occasionally used the Memorie Istoriche de
      Monarchi Ottomanni di Giovanni Sagredo, (Venezia, 1677, in 4to.)
      In peace and war, the Turks have ever engaged the attention of
      the republic of Venice. All her despatches and archives were open
      to a procurator of St. Mark, and Sagredo is not contemptible
      either in sense or style. Yet he too bitterly hates the infidels:
      he is ignorant of their language and manners; and his narrative,
      which allows only 70 pages to Mahomet II., (p. 69—140,) becomes
      more copious and authentic as he approaches the years 1640 and
      1644, the term of the historic labors of John Sagredo.]

      97 (return) [ As I am now taking an everlasting farewell of the
      Greek empire, I shall briefly mention the great collection of
      Byzantine writers whose names and testimonies have been
      successively repeated in this work. The Greeks presses of Aldus
      and the Italians were confined to the classics of a better age;
      and the first rude editions of Procopius, Agathias, Cedrenus,
      Zonaras, &c., were published by the learned diligence of the
      Germans. The whole Byzantine series (xxxvi. volumes in folio) has
      gradually issued (A.D. 1648, &c.) from the royal press of the
      Louvre, with some collateral aid from Rome and Leipsic; but the
      Venetian edition, (A.D. 1729,) though cheaper and more copious,
      is not less inferior in correctness than in magnificence to that
      of Paris. The merits of the French editors are various; but the
      value of Anna Comnena, Cinnamus, Villehardouin, &c., is enhanced
      by the historical notes of Charles de Fresne du Cange. His
      supplemental works, the Greek Glossary, the Constantinopolis
      Christiana, the Familiæ Byzantinæ, diffuse a steady light over
      the darkness of the Lower Empire. * Note: The new edition of the
      Byzantines, projected by Niebuhr, and continued under the
      patronage of the Prussian government, is the most convenient in
      size, and contains some authors (Leo Diaconus, Johannes Lydus,
      Corippus, the new fragment of Dexippus, Eunapius, &c., discovered
      by Mai) which could not be comprised in the former collections;
      but the names of such editors as Bekker, the Dindorfs, &c.,
      raised hopes of something more than the mere republication of the
      text, and the notes of former editors. Little, I regret to say,
      has been added of annotation, and in some cases, the old
      incorrect versions have been retained.—M.]
