Chapter XXXVI: Total Extinction Of The Western Empire.—Part I.

     Sack Of Rome By Genseric, King Of The Vandals.—His Naval
     Depredations.—Succession Of The Last Emperors Of The West,
     Maximus, Avitus, Majorian, Severus, Anthemius, Olybrius,
     Glycerius, Nepos, Augustulus.—Total Extinction Of The Western
     Empire.—Reign Of Odoacer, The First Barbarian King Of Italy.

      The loss or desolation of the provinces, from the Ocean to the
      Alps, impaired the glory and greatness of Rome: her internal
      prosperity was irretrievably destroyed by the separation of
      Africa. The rapacious Vandals confiscated the patrimonial estates
      of the senators, and intercepted the regular subsidies, which
      relieved the poverty and encouraged the idleness of the
      plebeians. The distress of the Romans was soon aggravated by an
      unexpected attack; and the province, so long cultivated for their
      use by industrious and obedient subjects, was armed against them
      by an ambitious Barbarian. The Vandals and Alani, who followed
      the successful standard of Genseric, had acquired a rich and
      fertile territory, which stretched along the coast above ninety
      days’ journey from Tangier to Tripoli; but their narrow limits
      were pressed and confined, on either side, by the sandy desert
      and the Mediterranean. The discovery and conquest of the Black
      nations, that might dwell beneath the torrid zone, could not
      tempt the rational ambition of Genseric; but he cast his eyes
      towards the sea; he resolved to create a naval power, and his
      bold resolution was executed with steady and active perseverance.

      The woods of Mount Atlas afforded an inexhaustible nursery of
      timber: his new subjects were skilled in the arts of navigation
      and ship-building; he animated his daring Vandals to embrace a
      mode of warfare which would render every maritime country
      accessible to their arms; the Moors and Africans were allured by
      the hopes of plunder; and, after an interval of six centuries,
      the fleets that issued from the port of Carthage again claimed
      the empire of the Mediterranean. The success of the Vandals, the
      conquest of Sicily, the sack of Palermo, and the frequent
      descents on the coast of Lucania, awakened and alarmed the mother
      of Valentinian, and the sister of Theodosius. Alliances were
      formed; and armaments, expensive and ineffectual, were prepared,
      for the destruction of the common enemy; who reserved his courage
      to encounter those dangers which his policy could not prevent or
      elude. The designs of the Roman government were repeatedly
      baffled by his artful delays, ambiguous promises, and apparent
      concessions; and the interposition of his formidable confederate,
      the king of the Huns, recalled the emperors from the conquest of
      Africa to the care of their domestic safety. The revolutions of
      the palace, which left the Western empire without a defender, and
      without a lawful prince, dispelled the apprehensions, and
      stimulated the avarice, of Genseric. He immediately equipped a
      numerous fleet of Vandals and Moors, and cast anchor at the mouth
      of the Tyber, about three months after the death of Valentinian,
      and the elevation of Maximus to the Imperial throne.

      The private life of the senator Petronius Maximus 1 was often
      alleged as a rare example of human felicity. His birth was noble
      and illustrious, since he descended from the Anician family; his
      dignity was supported by an adequate patrimony in land and money;
      and these advantages of fortune were accompanied with liberal
      arts and decent manners, which adorn or imitate the inestimable
      gifts of genius and virtue. The luxury of his palace and table
      was hospitable and elegant. Whenever Maximus appeared in public,
      he was surrounded by a train of grateful and obsequious clients;
      2 and it is possible that among these clients, he might deserve
      and possess some real friends. His merit was rewarded by the
      favor of the prince and senate: he thrice exercised the office of
      Prætorian præfect of Italy; he was twice invested with the
      consulship, and he obtained the rank of patrician. These civil
      honors were not incompatible with the enjoyment of leisure and
      tranquillity; his hours, according to the demands of pleasure or
      reason, were accurately distributed by a water-clock; and this
      avarice of time may be allowed to prove the sense which Maximus
      entertained of his own happiness. The injury which he received
      from the emperor Valentinian appears to excuse the most bloody
      revenge. Yet a philosopher might have reflected, that, if the
      resistance of his wife had been sincere, her chastity was still
      inviolate, and that it could never be restored if she had
      consented to the will of the adulterer. A patriot would have
      hesitated before he plunged himself and his country into those
      inevitable calamities which must follow the extinction of the
      royal house of Theodosius. The imprudent Maximus disregarded
      these salutary considerations; he gratified his resentment and
      ambition; he saw the bleeding corpse of Valentinian at his feet;
      and he heard himself saluted Emperor by the unanimous voice of
      the senate and people. But the day of his inauguration was the
      last day of his happiness. He was imprisoned (such is the lively
      expression of Sidonius) in the palace; and after passing a
      sleepless night, he sighed that he had attained the summit of his
      wishes, and aspired only to descend from the dangerous elevation.
      Oppressed by the weight of the diadem, he communicated his
      anxious thoughts to his friend and quaestor Fulgentius; and when
      he looked back with unavailing regret on the secure pleasures of
      his former life, the emperor exclaimed, “O fortunate Damocles, 3
      thy reign began and ended with the same dinner;” a well-known
      allusion, which Fulgentius afterwards repeated as an instructive
      lesson for princes and subjects.

      1 (return) [ Sidonius Apollinaris composed the thirteenth epistle
      of the second book, to refute the paradox of his friend Serranus,
      who entertained a singular, though generous, enthusiasm for the
      deceased emperor. This epistle, with some indulgence, may claim
      the praise of an elegant composition; and it throws much light on
      the character of Maximus.]

      2 (return) [ Clientum, praevia, pedisequa, circumfusa,
      populositas, is the train which Sidonius himself (l. i. epist. 9)
      assigns to another senator of rank]

      3 (return) [

     Districtus ensis cui super impia Cervice pendet, non Siculoe dapes
     Dulcem elaborabunt saporem: Non avium citharaeque cantus Somnum
     reducent. —Horat. Carm. iii. 1.

      Sidonius concludes his letter with the story of Damocles, which
      Cicero (Tusculan. v. 20, 21) had so inimitably told.]

      The reign of Maximus continued about three months. His hours, of
      which he had lost the command, were disturbed by remorse, or
      guilt, or terror, and his throne was shaken by the seditions of
      the soldiers, the people, and the confederate Barbarians. The
      marriage of his son Paladius with the eldest daughter of the late
      emperor, might tend to establish the hereditary succession of his
      family; but the violence which he offered to the empress Eudoxia,
      could proceed only from the blind impulse of lust or revenge. His
      own wife, the cause of these tragic events, had been seasonably
      removed by death; and the widow of Valentinian was compelled to
      violate her decent mourning, perhaps her real grief, and to
      submit to the embraces of a presumptuous usurper, whom she
      suspected as the assassin of her deceased husband. These
      suspicions were soon justified by the indiscreet confession of
      Maximus himself; and he wantonly provoked the hatred of his
      reluctant bride, who was still conscious that she was descended
      from a line of emperors. From the East, however, Eudoxia could
      not hope to obtain any effectual assistance; her father and her
      aunt Pulcheria were dead; her mother languished at Jerusalem in
      disgrace and exile; and the sceptre of Constantinople was in the
      hands of a stranger. She directed her eyes towards Carthage;
      secretly implored the aid of the king of the Vandals; and
      persuaded Genseric to improve the fair opportunity of disguising
      his rapacious designs by the specious names of honor, justice,
      and compassion. 4 Whatever abilities Maximus might have shown in
      a subordinate station, he was found incapable of administering an
      empire; and though he might easily have been informed of the
      naval preparations which were made on the opposite shores of
      Africa, he expected with supine indifference the approach of the
      enemy, without adopting any measures of defence, of negotiation,
      or of a timely retreat. When the Vandals disembarked at the mouth
      of the Tyber, the emperor was suddenly roused from his lethargy
      by the clamors of a trembling and exasperated multitude. The only
      hope which presented itself to his astonished mind was that of a
      precipitate flight, and he exhorted the senators to imitate the
      example of their prince. But no sooner did Maximus appear in the
      streets, than he was assaulted by a shower of stones; a Roman, or
      a Burgundian soldier, claimed the honor of the first wound; his
      mangled body was ignominiously cast into the Tyber; the Roman
      people rejoiced in the punishment which they had inflicted on the
      author of the public calamities; and the domestics of Eudoxia
      signalized their zeal in the service of their mistress. 5

      4 (return) [ Notwithstanding the evidence of Procopius, Evagrius,
      Idatius Marcellinus, &c., the learned Muratori (Annali d’Italia,
      tom. iv. p. 249) doubts the reality of this invitation, and
      observes, with great truth, “Non si puo dir quanto sia facile il
      popolo a sognare e spacciar voci false.” But his argument, from
      the interval of time and place, is extremely feeble. The figs
      which grew near Carthage were produced to the senate of Rome on
      the third day.]

      5 (return) [

     Infidoque tibi Burgundio ductu Extorquet trepidas mactandi
     principis iras. —-Sidon. in Panegyr. Avit. 442.

      A remarkable line, which insinuates that Rome and Maximus were
      betrayed by their Burgundian mercenaries.]

      On the third day after the tumult, Genseric boldly advanced from
      the port of Ostia to the gates of the defenceless city. Instead
      of a sally of the Roman youth, there issued from the gates an
      unarmed and venerable procession of the bishop at the head of his
      clergy. 6 The fearless spirit of Leo, his authority and
      eloquence, again mitigated the fierceness of a Barbarian
      conqueror; the king of the Vandals promised to spare the
      unresisting multitude, to protect the buildings from fire, and to
      exempt the captives from torture; and although such orders were
      neither seriously given, nor strictly obeyed, the mediation of
      Leo was glorious to himself, and in some degree beneficial to his
      country. But Rome and its inhabitants were delivered to the
      licentiousness of the Vandals and Moors, whose blind passions
      revenged the injuries of Carthage. The pillage lasted fourteen
      days and nights; and all that yet remained of public or private
      wealth, of sacred or profane treasure, was diligently transported
      to the vessels of Genseric. Among the spoils, the splendid relics
      of two temples, or rather of two religions, exhibited a memorable
      example of the vicissitudes of human and divine things.

      Since the abolition of Paganism, the Capitol had been violated
      and abandoned; yet the statues of the gods and heroes were still
      respected, and the curious roof of gilt bronze was reserved for
      the rapacious hands of Genseric. 7 The holy instruments of the
      Jewish worship, 8 the gold table, and the gold candlestick with
      seven branches, originally framed according to the particular
      instructions of God himself, and which were placed in the
      sanctuary of his temple, had been ostentatiously displayed to the
      Roman people in the triumph of Titus. They were afterwards
      deposited in the temple of Peace; and at the end of four hundred
      years, the spoils of Jerusalem were transferred from Rome to
      Carthage, by a Barbarian who derived his origin from the shores
      of the Baltic. These ancient monuments might attract the notice
      of curiosity, as well as of avarice. But the Christian churches,
      enriched and adorned by the prevailing superstition of the times,
      afforded more plentiful materials for sacrilege; and the pious
      liberality of Pope Leo, who melted six silver vases, the gift of
      Constantine, each of a hundred pounds weight, is an evidence of
      the damage which he attempted to repair. In the forty-five years
      that had elapsed since the Gothic invasion, the pomp and luxury
      of Rome were in some measure restored; and it was difficult
      either to escape, or to satisfy, the avarice of a conqueror, who
      possessed leisure to collect, and ships to transport, the wealth
      of the capital. The Imperial ornaments of the palace, the
      magnificent furniture and wardrobe, the sideboards of massy
      plate, were accumulated with disorderly rapine; the gold and
      silver amounted to several thousand talents; yet even the brass
      and copper were laboriously removed. Eudoxia herself, who
      advanced to meet her friend and deliverer, soon bewailed the
      imprudence of her own conduct. She was rudely stripped of her
      jewels; and the unfortunate empress, with her two daughters, the
      only surviving remains of the great Theodosius, was compelled, as
      a captive, to follow the haughty Vandal; who immediately hoisted
      sail, and returned with a prosperous navigation to the port of
      Carthage. 9 Many thousand Romans of both sexes, chosen for some
      useful or agreeable qualifications, reluctantly embarked on board
      the fleet of Genseric; and their distress was aggravated by the
      unfeeling Barbarians, who, in the division of the booty,
      separated the wives from their husbands, and the children from
      their parents. The charity of Deogratias, bishop of Carthage, 10
      was their only consolation and support. He generously sold the
      gold and silver plate of the church to purchase the freedom of
      some, to alleviate the slavery of others, and to assist the wants
      and infirmities of a captive multitude, whose health was impaired
      by the hardships which they had suffered in their passage from
      Italy to Africa. By his order, two spacious churches were
      converted into hospitals; the sick were distributed into
      convenient beds, and liberally supplied with food and medicines;
      and the aged prelate repeated his visits both in the day and
      night, with an assiduity that surpassed his strength, and a
      tender sympathy which enhanced the value of his services. Compare
      this scene with the field of Cannae; and judge between Hannibal
      and the successor of St. Cyprian. 11

      6 (return) [The apparant success of Pope Leo may be justified by
      Prosper, and the Historia Miscellan.; but the improbable notion
      of Baronius A.D. 455, (No. 13) that Genseric spared the three
      apostolical churches, is not countenanced even by the doubtful
      testimony of the Liber Pontificalis.]

      7 (return) [ The profusion of Catulus, the first who gilt the
      roof of the Capitol, was not universally approved, (Plin. Hist.
      Natur. xxxiii. 18;) but it was far exceeded by the emperor’s, and
      the external gilding of the temple cost Domitian 12,000 talents,
      (2,400,000 L.) The expressions of Claudian and Rutilius (luce
      metalli oemula.... fastigia astris, and confunduntque vagos
      delubra micantia visus) manifestly prove, that this splendid
      covering was not removed either by the Christians or the Goths,
      (see Donatus, Roma Antiqua, l. ii. c. 6, p. 125.) It should seem
      that the roof of the Capitol was decorated with gilt statues, and
      chariots drawn by four horses.]

      8 (return) [ The curious reader may consult the learned and
      accurate treatise of Hadrian Reland, de Spoliis Templi
      Hierosolymitani in Arcu Titiano Romae conspicuis, in 12mo.
      Trajecti ad Rhenum, 1716.]

      9 (return) [ The vessel which transported the relics of the
      Capitol was the only one of the whole fleet that suffered
      shipwreck. If a bigoted sophist, a Pagan bigot, had mentioned the
      accident, he might have rejoiced that this cargo of sacrilege was
      lost in the sea.]

      10 (return) [ See Victor Vitensis, de Persecut. Vandal. l. i. c.
      8, p. 11, 12, edit. Ruinart. Deogratius governed the church of
      Carthage only three years. If he had not been privately buried,
      his corpse would have been torn piecemeal by the mad devotion of
      the people.]

      11 (return) [ The general evidence for the death of Maximus, and
      the sack of Rome by the Vandals, is comprised in Sidonius,
      (Panegyr. Avit. 441-450,) Procopius, (de Bell. Vandal. l. i. c.
      4, 5, p. 188, 189, and l. ii. c. 9, p. 255,) Evagrius, (l. ii. c.
      7,) Jornandes, (de Reb. Geticis, c. 45, p. 677,) and the
      Chronicles of Idatius, Prosper, Marcellinus, and Theophanes,
      under the proper year.]

      The deaths of Ætius and Valentinian had relaxed the ties which
      held the Barbarians of Gaul in peace and subordination. The
      sea-coast was infested by the Saxons; the Alemanni and the Franks
      advanced from the Rhine to the Seine; and the ambition of the
      Goths seemed to meditate more extensive and permanent conquests.
      The emperor Maximus relieved himself, by a judicious choice, from
      the weight of these distant cares; he silenced the solicitations
      of his friends, listened to the voice of fame, and promoted a
      stranger to the general command of the forces of Gaul.

      Avitus, 12 the stranger, whose merit was so nobly rewarded,
      descended from a wealthy and honorable family in the diocese of
      Auvergne. The convulsions of the times urged him to embrace, with
      the same ardor, the civil and military professions: and the
      indefatigable youth blended the studies of literature and
      jurisprudence with the exercise of arms and hunting. Thirty years
      of his life were laudably spent in the public service; he
      alternately displayed his talents in war and negotiation; and the
      soldier of Ætius, after executing the most important embassies,
      was raised to the station of Prætorian præfect of Gaul. Either
      the merit of Avitus excited envy, or his moderation was desirous
      of repose, since he calmly retired to an estate, which he
      possessed in the neighborhood of Clermont. A copious stream,
      issuing from the mountain, and falling headlong in many a loud
      and foaming cascade, discharged its waters into a lake about two
      miles in length, and the villa was pleasantly seated on the
      margin of the lake. The baths, the porticos, the summer and
      winter apartments, were adapted to the purposes of luxury and
      use; and the adjacent country afforded the various prospects of
      woods, pastures, and meadows. 13 In this retreat, where Avitus
      amused his leisure with books, rural sports, the practice of
      husbandry, and the society of his friends, 14 he received the
      Imperial diploma, which constituted him master-general of the
      cavalry and infantry of Gaul. He assumed the military command;
      the Barbarians suspended their fury; and whatever means he might
      employ, whatever concessions he might be forced to make, the
      people enjoyed the benefits of actual tranquillity. But the fate
      of Gaul depended on the Visigoths; and the Roman general, less
      attentive to his dignity than to the public interest, did not
      disdain to visit Thoulouse in the character of an ambassador. He
      was received with courteous hospitality by Theodoric, the king of
      the Goths; but while Avitus laid the foundations of a solid
      alliance with that powerful nation, he was astonished by the
      intelligence, that the emperor Maximus was slain, and that Rome
      had been pillaged by the Vandals. A vacant throne, which he might
      ascend without guilt or danger, tempted his ambition; 15 and the
      Visigoths were easily persuaded to support his claim by their
      irresistible suffrage. They loved the person of Avitus; they
      respected his virtues; and they were not insensible of the
      advantage, as well as honor, of giving an emperor to the West.
      The season was now approaching, in which the annual assembly of
      the seven provinces was held at Arles; their deliberations might
      perhaps be influenced by the presence of Theodoric and his
      martial brothers; but their choice would naturally incline to the
      most illustrious of their countrymen. Avitus, after a decent
      resistance, accepted the Imperial diadem from the representatives
      of Gaul; and his election was ratified by the acclamations of the
      Barbarians and provincials. The formal consent of Marcian,
      emperor of the East, was solicited and obtained; but the senate,
      Rome, and Italy, though humbled by their recent calamities,
      submitted with a secret murmur to the presumption of the Gallic
      usurper.

      12 (return) [ The private life and elevation of Avitus must be
      deduced, with becoming suspicion, from the panegyric pronounced
      by Sidonius Apollinaris, his subject, and his son-in-law.]

      13 (return) [ After the example of the younger Pliny, Sidonius
      (l. ii. c. 2) has labored the florid, prolix, and obscure
      description of his villa, which bore the name, (Avitacum,) and
      had been the property of Avitus. The precise situation is not
      ascertained. Consult, however, the notes of Savaron and Sirmond.]

      14 (return) [ Sidonius (l. ii. epist. 9) has described the
      country life of the Gallic nobles, in a visit which he made to
      his friends, whose estates were in the neighborhood of Nismes.
      The morning hours were spent in the sphoeristerium, or
      tennis-court; or in the library, which was furnished with Latin
      authors, profane and religious; the former for the men, the
      latter for the ladies. The table was twice served, at dinner and
      supper, with hot meat (boiled and roast) and wine. During the
      intermediate time, the company slept, took the air on horseback,
      and need the warm bath.]

      15 (return) [ Seventy lines of panegyric (505-575) which describe
      the importunity of Theodoric and of Gaul, struggling to overcome
      the modest reluctance of Avitus, are blown away by three words of
      an honest historian. Romanum ambisset Imperium, (Greg. Turon. l.
      ii. c. 1l, in tom. ii. p. 168.)]

      Theodoric, to whom Avitus was indebted for the purple, had
      acquired the Gothic sceptre by the murder of his elder brother
      Torismond; and he justified this atrocious deed by the design
      which his predecessor had formed of violating his alliance with
      the empire. 16 Such a crime might not be incompatible with the
      virtues of a Barbarian; but the manners of Theodoric were gentle
      and humane; and posterity may contemplate without terror the
      original picture of a Gothic king, whom Sidonius had intimately
      observed, in the hours of peace and of social intercourse. In an
      epistle, dated from the court of Thoulouse, the orator satisfies
      the curiosity of one of his friends, in the following
      description: 17 “By the majesty of his appearance, Theodoric
      would command the respect of those who are ignorant of his merit;
      and although he is born a prince, his merit would dignify a
      private station. He is of a middle stature, his body appears
      rather plump than fat, and in his well-proportioned limbs agility
      is united with muscular strength. 18 If you examine his
      countenance, you will distinguish a high forehead, large shaggy
      eyebrows, an aquiline nose, thin lips, a regular set of white
      teeth, and a fair complexion, that blushes more frequently from
      modesty than from anger. The ordinary distribution of his time,
      as far as it is exposed to the public view, may be concisely
      represented. Before daybreak, he repairs, with a small train, to
      his domestic chapel, where the service is performed by the Arian
      clergy; but those who presume to interpret his secret sentiments,
      consider this assiduous devotion as the effect of habit and
      policy. The rest of the morning is employed in the administration
      of his kingdom. His chair is surrounded by some military officers
      of decent aspect and behavior: the noisy crowd of his Barbarian
      guards occupies the hall of audience; but they are not permitted
      to stand within the veils or curtains that conceal the
      council-chamber from vulgar eyes. The ambassadors of the nations
      are successively introduced: Theodoric listens with attention,
      answers them with discreet brevity, and either announces or
      delays, according to the nature of their business, his final
      resolution. About eight (the second hour) he rises from his
      throne, and visits either his treasury or his stables. If he
      chooses to hunt, or at least to exercise himself on horseback,
      his bow is carried by a favorite youth; but when the game is
      marked, he bends it with his own hand, and seldom misses the
      object of his aim: as a king, he disdains to bear arms in such
      ignoble warfare; but as a soldier, he would blush to accept any
      military service which he could perform himself. On common days,
      his dinner is not different from the repast of a private citizen,
      but every Saturday, many honorable guests are invited to the
      royal table, which, on these occasions, is served with the
      elegance of Greece, the plenty of Gaul, and the order and
      diligence of Italy. 19 The gold or silver plate is less
      remarkable for its weight than for the brightness and curious
      workmanship: the taste is gratified without the help of foreign
      and costly luxury; the size and number of the cups of wine are
      regulated with a strict regard to the laws of temperance; and the
      respectful silence that prevails, is interrupted only by grave
      and instructive conversation. After dinner, Theodoric sometimes
      indulges himself in a short slumber; and as soon as he wakes, he
      calls for the dice and tables, encourages his friends to forget
      the royal majesty, and is delighted when they freely express the
      passions which are excited by the incidents of play. At this
      game, which he loves as the image of war, he alternately displays
      his eagerness, his skill, his patience, and his cheerful temper.
      If he loses, he laughs; he is modest and silent if he wins. Yet,
      notwithstanding this seeming indifference, his courtiers choose
      to solicit any favor in the moments of victory; and I myself, in
      my applications to the king, have derived some benefit from my
      losses. 20 About the ninth hour (three o’clock) the tide of
      business again returns, and flows incessantly till after sunset,
      when the signal of the royal supper dismisses the weary crowd of
      suppliants and pleaders. At the supper, a more familiar repast,
      buffoons and pantomimes are sometimes introduced, to divert, not
      to offend, the company, by their ridiculous wit: but female
      singers, and the soft, effeminate modes of music, are severely
      banished, and such martial tunes as animate the soul to deeds of
      valor are alone grateful to the ear of Theodoric. He retires from
      table; and the nocturnal guards are immediately posted at the
      entrance of the treasury, the palace, and the private
      apartments.”

      Thoulouse.]

      When the king of the Visigoths encouraged Avitus to assume the
      purple, he offered his person and his forces, as a faithful
      soldier of the republic. 21 The exploits of Theodoric soon
      convinced the world that he had not degenerated from the warlike
      virtues of his ancestors. After the establishment of the Goths in
      Aquitain, and the passage of the Vandals into Africa, the Suevi,
      who had fixed their kingdom in Gallicia, aspired to the conquest
      of Spain, and threatened to extinguish the feeble remains of the
      Roman dominion. The provincials of Carthagena and Tarragona,
      afflicted by a hostile invasion, represented their injuries and
      their apprehensions. Count Fronto was despatched, in the name of
      the emperor Avitus, with advantageous offers of peace and
      alliance; and Theodoric interposed his weighty mediation, to
      declare, that, unless his brother-in-law, the king of the Suevi,
      immediately retired, he should be obliged to arm in the cause of
      justice and of Rome. “Tell him,” replied the haughty Rechiarius,
      “that I despise his friendship and his arms; but that I shall
      soon try whether he will dare to expect my arrival under the
      walls of Thoulouse.” Such a challenge urged Theodoric to prevent
      the bold designs of his enemy; he passed the Pyrenees at the head
      of the Visigoths: the Franks and Burgundians served under his
      standard; and though he professed himself the dutiful servant of
      Avitus, he privately stipulated, for himself and his successors,
      the absolute possession of his Spanish conquests. The two armies,
      or rather the two nations, encountered each other on the banks of
      the River Urbicus, about twelve miles from Astorga; and the
      decisive victory of the Goths appeared for a while to have
      extirpated the name and kingdom of the Suevi. From the field of
      battle Theodoric advanced to Braga, their metropolis, which still
      retained the splendid vestiges of its ancient commerce and
      dignity. 22 His entrance was not polluted with blood; and the
      Goths respected the chastity of their female captives, more
      especially of the consecrated virgins: but the greatest part of
      the clergy and people were made slaves, and even the churches and
      altars were confounded in the universal pillage. The unfortunate
      king of the Suevi had escaped to one of the ports of the ocean;
      but the obstinacy of the winds opposed his flight: he was
      delivered to his implacable rival; and Rechiarius, who neither
      desired nor expected mercy, received, with manly constancy, the
      death which he would probably have inflicted. After this bloody
      sacrifice to policy or resentment, Theodoric carried his
      victorious arms as far as Merida, the principal town of
      Lusitania, without meeting any resistance, except from the
      miraculous powers of St. Eulalia; but he was stopped in the full
      career of success, and recalled from Spain before he could
      provide for the security of his conquests. In his retreat towards
      the Pyrenees, he revenged his disappointment on the country
      through which he passed; and, in the sack of Pollentia and
      Astorga, he showed himself a faithless ally, as well as a cruel
      enemy. Whilst the king of the Visigoths fought and vanquished in
      the name of Avitus, the reign of Avitus had expired; and both the
      honor and the interest of Theodoric were deeply wounded by the
      disgrace of a friend, whom he had seated on the throne of the
      Western empire. 23

      Chapter XXXVI: Total Extinction Of The Western Empire.—Part II.

      The pressing solicitations of the senate and people persuaded the
      emperor Avitus to fix his residence at Rome, and to accept the
      consulship for the ensuing year. On the first day of January, his
      son-in-law, Sidonius Apollinaris, celebrated his praises in a
      panegyric of six hundred verses; but this composition, though it
      was rewarded with a brass statue, 24 seems to contain a very
      moderate proportion, either of genius or of truth. The poet, if
      we may degrade that sacred name, exaggerates the merit of a
      sovereign and a father; and his prophecy of a long and glorious
      reign was soon contradicted by the event. Avitus, at a time when
      the Imperial dignity was reduced to a preeminence of toil and
      danger, indulged himself in the pleasures of Italian luxury: age
      had not extinguished his amorous inclinations; and he is accused
      of insulting, with indiscreet and ungenerous raillery, the
      husbands whose wives he had seduced or violated. 25 But the
      Romans were not inclined either to excuse his faults or to
      acknowledge his virtues. The several parts of the empire became
      every day more alienated from each other; and the stranger of
      Gaul was the object of popular hatred and contempt. The senate
      asserted their legitimate claim in the election of an emperor;
      and their authority, which had been originally derived from the
      old constitution, was again fortified by the actual weakness of a
      declining monarchy. Yet even such a monarchy might have resisted
      the votes of an unarmed senate, if their discontent had not been
      supported, or perhaps inflamed, by the Count Ricimer, one of the
      principal commanders of the Barbarian troops, who formed the
      military defence of Italy. The daughter of Wallia, king of the
      Visigoths, was the mother of Ricimer; but he was descended, on
      the father’s side, from the nation of the Suevi; 26 his pride or
      patriotism might be exasperated by the misfortunes of his
      countrymen; and he obeyed, with reluctance, an emperor in whose
      elevation he had not been consulted. His faithful and important
      services against the common enemy rendered him still more
      formidable; 27 and, after destroying on the coast of Corsica a
      fleet of Vandals, which consisted of sixty galleys, Ricimer
      returned in triumph with the appellation of the Deliverer of
      Italy. He chose that moment to signify to Avitus, that his reign
      was at an end; and the feeble emperor, at a distance from his
      Gothic allies, was compelled, after a short and unavailing
      struggle to abdicate the purple. By the clemency, however, or the
      contempt, of Ricimer, 28 he was permitted to descend from the
      throne to the more desirable station of bishop of Placentia: but
      the resentment of the senate was still unsatisfied; and their
      inflexible severity pronounced the sentence of his death. He fled
      towards the Alps, with the humble hope, not of arming the
      Visigoths in his cause, but of securing his person and treasures
      in the sanctuary of Julian, one of the tutelar saints of
      Auvergne. 29 Disease, or the hand of the executioner, arrested
      him on the road; yet his remains were decently transported to
      Brivas, or Brioude, in his native province, and he reposed at the
      feet of his holy patron. 30 Avitus left only one daughter, the
      wife of Sidonius Apollinaris, who inherited the patrimony of his
      father-in-law; lamenting, at the same time, the disappointment of
      his public and private expectations. His resentment prompted him
      to join, or at least to countenance, the measures of a rebellious
      faction in Gaul; and the poet had contracted some guilt, which it
      was incumbent on him to expiate, by a new tribute of flattery to
      the succeeding emperor. 31

      death of Avitus was violent; but it must have been secret, since

      plaque.]

      31 (return) [ After a modest appeal to the examples of his

      debt, and promises payment.

     meae vitae laus tua sit pretium. —Sidon. Apoll. Carm. iv. p. 308

      See Dubos, Hist. Critique, tom. i. p. 448, &c.]

      The successor of Avitus presents the welcome discovery of a great
      and heroic character, such as sometimes arise, in a degenerate
      age, to vindicate the honor of the human species. The emperor
      Majorian has deserved the praises of his contemporaries, and of
      posterity; and these praises may be strongly expressed in the
      words of a judicious and disinterested historian: “That he was
      gentle to his subjects; that he was terrible to his enemies; and
      that he excelled, in every virtue, all his predecessors who had
      reigned over the Romans.” 32 Such a testimony may justify at
      least the panegyric of Sidonius; and we may acquiesce in the
      assurance, that, although the obsequious orator would have
      flattered, with equal zeal, the most worthless of princes, the
      extraordinary merit of his object confined him, on this occasion,
      within the bounds of truth. 33 Majorian derived his name from his
      maternal grandfather, who, in the reign of the great Theodosius,
      had commanded the troops of the Illyrian frontier. He gave his
      daughter in marriage to the father of Majorian, a respectable
      officer, who administered the revenues of Gaul with skill and
      integrity; and generously preferred the friendship of Ætius to
      the tempting offer of an insidious court. His son, the future
      emperor, who was educated in the profession of arms, displayed,
      from his early youth, intrepid courage, premature wisdom, and
      unbounded liberality in a scanty fortune. He followed the
      standard of Ætius, contributed to his success, shared, and
      sometimes eclipsed, his glory, and at last excited the jealousy
      of the patrician, or rather of his wife, who forced him to retire
      from the service. 34 Majorian, after the death of Ætius, was
      recalled and promoted; and his intimate connection with Count
      Ricimer was the immediate step by which he ascended the throne of
      the Western empire. During the vacancy that succeeded the
      abdication of Avitus, the ambitious Barbarian, whose birth
      excluded him from the Imperial dignity, governed Italy with the
      title of Patrician; resigned to his friend the conspicuous
      station of master-general of the cavalry and infantry; and, after
      an interval of some months, consented to the unanimous wish of
      the Romans, whose favor Majorian had solicited by a recent
      victory over the Alemanni. 35 He was invested with the purple at
      Ravenna: and the epistle which he addressed to the senate, will
      best describe his situation and his sentiments. “Your election,
      Conscript Fathers! and the ordinance of the most valiant army,
      have made me your emperor. 36 May the propitious Deity direct and
      prosper the counsels and events of my administration, to your
      advantage and to the public welfare! For my own part, I did not
      aspire, I have submitted to reign; nor should I have discharged
      the obligations of a citizen if I had refused, with base and
      selfish ingratitude, to support the weight of those labors, which
      were imposed by the republic. Assist, therefore, the prince whom
      you have made; partake the duties which you have enjoined; and
      may our common endeavors promote the happiness of an empire,
      which I have accepted from your hands. Be assured, that, in our
      times, justice shall resume her ancient vigor, and that virtue
      shall become, not only innocent, but meritorious. Let none,
      except the authors themselves, be apprehensive of delations, 37
      which, as a subject, I have always condemned, and, as a prince,
      will severely punish. Our own vigilance, and that of our father,
      the patrician Ricimer, shall regulate all military affairs, and
      provide for the safety of the Roman world, which we have saved
      from foreign and domestic enemies. 38 You now understand the
      maxims of my government; you may confide in the faithful love and
      sincere assurances of a prince who has formerly been the
      companion of your life and dangers; who still glories in the name
      of senator, and who is anxious that you should never repent the
      judgment which you have pronounced in his favor.” The emperor,
      who, amidst the ruins of the Roman world, revived the ancient
      language of law and liberty, which Trajan would not have
      disclaimed, must have derived those generous sentiments from his
      own heart; since they were not suggested to his imitation by the
      customs of his age, or the example of his predecessors. 39

      32 (return) [ The words of Procopius deserve to be transcribed
      (de Bell. Vandal. l. i. c. 7, p. 194;) a concise but
      comprehensive definition of royal virtue.]

      33 (return) [ The Panegyric was pronounced at Lyons before the
      end of the year 458, while the emperor was still consul. It has
      more art than genius, and more labor than art. The ornaments are
      false and trivial; the expression is feeble and prolix; and
      Sidonius wants the skill to exhibit the principal figure in a
      strong and distinct light. The private life of Majorian occupies
      about two hundred lines, 107-305.]

      34 (return) [ She pressed his immediate death, and was scarcely
      satisfied with his disgrace. It should seem that Ætius, like
      Belisarius and Marlborough, was governed by his wife; whose
      fervent piety, though it might work miracles, (Gregor. Turon. l.
      ii. c. 7, p. 162,) was not incompatible with base and sanguinary
      counsels.]

      35 (return) [ The Alemanni had passed the Rhaetian Alps, and were
      defeated in the Campi Canini, or Valley of Bellinzone, through
      which the Tesin flows, in its descent from Mount Adula to the
      Lago Maggiore, (Cluver Italia Antiq. tom. i. p. 100, 101.) This
      boasted victory over nine hundred Barbarians (Panegyr. Majorian.
      373, &c.) betrays the extreme weakness of Italy.]

      arbitrio, et fortissimi exercitus ordinatione agnoscite, (Novell.

      proclaims the unanimous voice of the empire:—

     Postquam ordine vobis Ordo omnis regnum dederat; plebs, curia,
     nules, —-Et collega simul. 386.

      This language is ancient and constitutional; and we may observe,
      that the clergy were not yet considered as a distinct order of
      the state.]

      37 (return) [ Either dilationes, or delationes would afford a
      tolerable reading, but there is much more sense and spirit in the
      latter, to which I have therefore given the preference.]

      38 (return) [ Ab externo hoste et a domestica clade liberavimus:
      by the latter, Majorian must understand the tyranny of Avitus;
      whose death he consequently avowed as a meritorious act. On this
      occasion, Sidonius is fearful and obscure; he describes the
      twelve Caesars, the nations of Africa, &c., that he may escape
      the dangerous name of Avitus (805-369.)]

      39 (return) [ See the whole edict or epistle of Majorian to the
      senate, (Novell. tit. iv. p. 34.) Yet the expression, regnum
      nostrum, bears some taint of the age, and does not mix kindly
      with the word respublica, which he frequently repeats.]

      The private and public actions of Majorian are very imperfectly
      known: but his laws, remarkable for an original cast of thought
      and expression, faithfully represent the character of a sovereign
      who loved his people, who sympathized in their distress, who had
      studied the causes of the decline of the empire, and who was
      capable of applying (as far as such reformation was practicable)
      judicious and effectual remedies to the public disorders. 40 His
      regulations concerning the finances manifestly tended to remove,
      or at least to mitigate, the most intolerable grievances. I. From
      the first hour of his reign, he was solicitous (I translate his
      own words) to relieve the weary fortunes of the provincials,
      oppressed by the accumulated weight of indictions and
      superindictions. 41 With this view he granted a universal
      amnesty, a final and absolute discharge of all arrears of
      tribute, of all debts, which, under any pretence, the fiscal
      officers might demand from the people. This wise dereliction of
      obsolete, vexatious, and unprofitable claims, improved and
      purified the sources of the public revenue; and the subject who
      could now look back without despair, might labor with hope and
      gratitude for himself and for his country. II. In the assessment
      and collection of taxes, Majorian restored the ordinary
      jurisdiction of the provincial magistrates; and suppressed the
      extraordinary commissions which had been introduced, in the name
      of the emperor himself, or of the Prætorian præfects. The
      favorite servants, who obtained such irregular powers, were
      insolent in their behavior, and arbitrary in their demands: they
      affected to despise the subordinate tribunals, and they were
      discontented, if their fees and profits did not twice exceed the
      sum which they condescended to pay into the treasury. One
      instance of their extortion would appear incredible, were it not
      authenticated by the legislator himself. They exacted the whole
      payment in gold: but they refused the current coin of the empire,
      and would accept only such ancient pieces as were stamped with
      the names of Faustina or the Antonines. The subject, who was
      unprovided with these curious medals, had recourse to the
      expedient of compounding with their rapacious demands; or if he
      succeeded in the research, his imposition was doubled, according
      to the weight and value of the money of former times. 42 III.
      “The municipal corporations, (says the emperor,) the lesser
      senates, (so antiquity has justly styled them,) deserve to be
      considered as the heart of the cities, and the sinews of the
      republic. And yet so low are they now reduced, by the injustice
      of magistrates and the venality of collectors, that many of their
      members, renouncing their dignity and their country, have taken
      refuge in distant and obscure exile.” He urges, and even compels,
      their return to their respective cities; but he removes the
      grievance which had forced them to desert the exercise of their
      municipal functions. They are directed, under the authority of
      the provincial magistrates, to resume their office of levying the
      tribute; but, instead of being made responsible for the whole sum
      assessed on their district, they are only required to produce a
      regular account of the payments which they have actually
      received, and of the defaulters who are still indebted to the
      public. IV. But Majorian was not ignorant that these corporate
      bodies were too much inclined to retaliate the injustice and
      oppression which they had suffered; and he therefore revives the
      useful office of the defenders of cities. He exhorts the people
      to elect, in a full and free assembly, some man of discretion and
      integrity, who would dare to assert their privileges, to
      represent their grievances, to protect the poor from the tyranny
      of the rich, and to inform the emperor of the abuses that were

      sixty-eight, English grains. Majorian gives currency to all gold
      coin, excepting only the Gallic solidus, from its deficiency, not
      in the weight, but in the standard.]

      The spectator who casts a mournful view over the ruins of ancient
      Rome, is tempted to accuse the memory of the Goths and Vandals,
      for the mischief which they had neither leisure, nor power, nor
      perhaps inclination, to perpetrate. The tempest of war might
      strike some lofty turrets to the ground; but the destruction
      which undermined the foundations of those massy fabrics was
      prosecuted, slowly and silently, during a period of ten
      centuries; and the motives of interest, that afterwards operated
      without shame or control, were severely checked by the taste and
      spirit of the emperor Majorian. The decay of the city had
      gradually impaired the value of the public works. The circus and
      theatres might still excite, but they seldom gratified, the
      desires of the people: the temples, which had escaped the zeal of
      the Christians, were no longer inhabited, either by gods or men;
      the diminished crowds of the Romans were lost in the immense
      space of their baths and porticos; and the stately libraries and
      halls of justice became useless to an indolent generation, whose
      repose was seldom disturbed, either by study or business. The
      monuments of consular, or Imperial, greatness were no longer
      revered, as the immortal glory of the capital: they were only
      esteemed as an inexhaustible mine of materials, cheaper, and more
      convenient than the distant quarry. Specious petitions were
      continually addressed to the easy magistrates of Rome, which
      stated the want of stones or bricks, for some necessary service:
      the fairest forms of architecture were rudely defaced, for the
      sake of some paltry, or pretended, repairs; and the degenerate
      Romans, who converted the spoil to their own emolument,
      demolished, with sacrilegious hands, the labors of their
      ancestors. Majorian, who had often sighed over the desolation of
      the city, applied a severe remedy to the growing evil. 43 He
      reserved to the prince and senate the sole cognizance of the
      extreme cases which might justify the destruction of an ancient
      edifice; imposed a fine of fifty pounds of gold (two thousand
      pounds sterling) on every magistrate who should presume to grant
      such illegal and scandalous license, and threatened to chastise
      the criminal obedience of their subordinate officers, by a severe
      whipping, and the amputation of both their hands. In the last
      instance, the legislator might seem to forget the proportion of
      guilt and punishment; but his zeal arose from a generous
      principle, and Majorian was anxious to protect the monuments of
      those ages, in which he would have desired and deserved to live.
      The emperor conceived, that it was his interest to increase the
      number of his subjects; and that it was his duty to guard the
      purity of the marriage-bed: but the means which he employed to
      accomplish these salutary purposes are of an ambiguous, and
      perhaps exceptionable, kind. The pious maids, who consecrated
      their virginity to Christ, were restrained from taking the veil
      till they had reached their fortieth year. Widows under that age
      were compelled to form a second alliance within the term of five
      years, by the forfeiture of half their wealth to their nearest
      relations, or to the state. Unequal marriages were condemned or
      annulled. The punishment of confiscation and exile was deemed so
      inadequate to the guilt of adultery, that, if the criminal
      returned to Italy, he might, by the express declaration of
      Majorian, be slain with impunity. 44

      43 (return) [ The whole edict (Novell. Majorian. tit. vi. p. 35)
      is curious. “Antiquarum aedium dissipatur speciosa constructio;
      et ut aliquid reparetur, magna diruuntur. Hinc jam occasio
      nascitur, ut etiam unusquisque privatum aedificium construens,
      per gratiam judicum..... praesumere de publicis locis necessaria,
      et transferre non dubitet” &c. With equal zeal, but with less
      power, Petrarch, in the fourteenth century, repeated the same
      complaints. (Vie de Petrarque, tom. i. p. 326, 327.) If I
      prosecute this history, I shall not be unmindful of the decline
      and fall of the city of Rome; an interesting object to which any
      plan was originally confined.]

      44 (return) [ The emperor chides the lenity of Rogatian, consular
      of Tuscany in a style of acrimonious reproof, which sounds almost
      like personal resentment, (Novell. tit. ix. p. 47.) The law of
      Majorian, which punished obstinate widows, was soon afterwards
      repealed by his successor Severus, (Novell. Sever. tit. i. p.
      37.)]

      While the emperor Majorian assiduously labored to restore the
      happiness and virtue of the Romans, he encountered the arms of
      Genseric, from his character and situation their most formidable
      enemy. A fleet of Vandals and Moors landed at the mouth of the
      Liris, or Garigliano; but the Imperial troops surprised and
      attacked the disorderly Barbarians, who were encumbered with the
      spoils of Campania; they were chased with slaughter to their
      ships, and their leader, the king’s brother-in-law, was found in
      the number of the slain. 45 Such vigilance might announce the
      character of the new reign; but the strictest vigilance, and the
      most numerous forces, were insufficient to protect the
      long-extended coast of Italy from the depredations of a naval
      war. The public opinion had imposed a nobler and more arduous
      task on the genius of Majorian. Rome expected from him alone the
      restitution of Africa; and the design, which he formed, of
      attacking the Vandals in their new settlements, was the result of
      bold and judicious policy. If the intrepid emperor could have
      infused his own spirit into the youth of Italy; if he could have
      revived in the field of Mars, the manly exercises in which he had
      always surpassed his equals; he might have marched against
      Genseric at the head of a Roman army. Such a reformation of
      national manners might be embraced by the rising generation; but
      it is the misfortune of those princes who laboriously sustain a
      declining monarchy, that, to obtain some immediate advantage, or
      to avert some impending danger, they are forced to countenance,
      and even to multiply, the most pernicious abuses. Majorian, like
      the weakest of his predecessors, was reduced to the disgraceful
      expedient of substituting Barbarian auxiliaries in the place of
      his unwarlike subjects: and his superior abilities could only be
      displayed in the vigor and dexterity with which he wielded a
      dangerous instrument, so apt to recoil on the hand that used it.
      Besides the confederates, who were already engaged in the service
      of the empire, the fame of his liberality and valor attracted the
      nations of the Danube, the Borysthenes, and perhaps of the
      Tanais. Many thousands of the bravest subjects of Attila, the
      Gepidae, the Ostrogoths, the Rugians, the Burgundians, the Suevi,
      the Alani, assembled in the plains of Liguria; and their
      formidable strength was balanced by their mutual animosities. 46
      They passed the Alps in a severe winter. The emperor led the way,
      on foot, and in complete armor; sounding, with his long staff,
      the depth of the ice, or snow, and encouraging the Scythians, who
      complained of the extreme cold, by the cheerful assurance, that
      they should be satisfied with the heat of Africa. The citizens of
      Lyons had presumed to shut their gates; they soon implored, and
      experienced, the clemency of Majorian. He vanquished Theodoric in
      the field; and admitted to his friendship and alliance a king
      whom he had found not unworthy of his arms. The beneficial,
      though precarious, reunion of the greater part of Gaul and Spain,
      was the effect of persuasion, as well as of force; 47 and the
      independent Bagaudae, who had escaped, or resisted, the
      oppression, of former reigns, were disposed to confide in the
      virtues of Majorian. His camp was filled with Barbarian allies;
      his throne was supported by the zeal of an affectionate people;
      but the emperor had foreseen, that it was impossible, without a
      maritime power, to achieve the conquest of Africa. In the first
      Punic war, the republic had exerted such incredible diligence,
      that, within sixty days after the first stroke of the axe had
      been given in the forest, a fleet of one hundred and sixty
      galleys proudly rode at anchor in the sea. 48 Under circumstances
      much less favorable, Majorian equalled the spirit and
      perseverance of the ancient Romans. The woods of the Apennine
      were felled; the arsenals and manufactures of Ravenna and Misenum
      were restored; Italy and Gaul vied with each other in liberal
      contributions to the public service; and the Imperial navy of
      three hundred large galleys, with an adequate proportion of
      transports and smaller vessels, was collected in the secure and
      capacious harbor of Carthagena in Spain. 49 The intrepid
      countenance of Majorian animated his troops with a confidence of
      victory; and, if we might credit the historian Procopius, his
      courage sometimes hurried him beyond the bounds of prudence.
      Anxious to explore, with his own eyes, the state of the Vandals,
      he ventured, after disguising the color of his hair, to visit
      Carthage, in the character of his own ambassador: and Genseric
      was afterwards mortified by the discovery, that he had
      entertained and dismissed the emperor of the Romans. Such an
      anecdote may be rejected as an improbable fiction; but it is a
      fiction which would not have been imagined, unless in the life of
      a hero. 50

      Chapter XXXVI: Total Extinction Of The Western Empire.—Part III.

      Without the help of a personal interview, Genseric was
      sufficiently acquainted with the genius and designs of his
      adversary. He practiced his customary arts of fraud and delay,
      but he practiced them without success. His applications for peace
      became each hour more submissive, and perhaps more sincere; but
      the inflexible Majorian had adopted the ancient maxim, that Rome
      could not be safe, as long as Carthage existed in a hostile
      state. The king of the Vandals distrusted the valor of his native
      subjects, who were enervated by the luxury of the South; 51 he
      suspected the fidelity of the vanquished people, who abhorred him
      as an Arian tyrant; and the desperate measure, which he executed,
      of reducing Mauritania into a desert, 52 could not defeat the
      operations of the Roman emperor, who was at liberty to land his
      troops on any part of the African coast. But Genseric was saved
      from impending and inevitable ruin by the treachery of some
      powerful subjects, envious, or apprehensive, of their master’s
      success. Guided by their secret intelligence, he surprised the
      unguarded fleet in the Bay of Carthagena: many of the ships were
      sunk, or taken, or burnt; and the preparations of three years
      were destroyed in a single day. 53 After this event, the behavior
      of the two antagonists showed them superior to their fortune. The
      Vandal, instead of being elated by this accidental victory,
      immediately renewed his solicitations for peace. The emperor of
      the West, who was capable of forming great designs, and of
      supporting heavy disappointments, consented to a treaty, or
      rather to a suspension of arms; in the full assurance that,
      before he could restore his navy, he should be supplied with
      provocations to justify a second war. Majorian returned to Italy,
      to prosecute his labors for the public happiness; and, as he was
      conscious of his own integrity, he might long remain ignorant of
      the dark conspiracy which threatened his throne and his life. The
      recent misfortune of Carthagena sullied the glory which had
      dazzled the eyes of the multitude; almost every description of
      civil and military officers were exasperated against the
      Reformer, since they all derived some advantage from the abuses
      which he endeavored to suppress; and the patrician Ricimer
      impelled the inconstant passions of the Barbarians against a
      prince whom he esteemed and hated. The virtues of Majorian could
      not protect him from the impetuous sedition, which broke out in
      the camp near Tortona, at the foot of the Alps. He was compelled
      to abdicate the Imperial purple: five days after his abdication,
      it was reported that he died of a dysentery; 54 and the humble
      tomb, which covered his remains, was consecrated by the respect
      and gratitude of succeeding generations. 55 The private character
      of Majorian inspired love and respect. Malicious calumny and
      satire excited his indignation, or, if he himself were the
      object, his contempt; but he protected the freedom of wit, and,
      in the hours which the emperor gave to the familiar society of
      his friends, he could indulge his taste for pleasantry, without
      degrading the majesty of his rank. 56

      56 (return) [ Sidonius gives a tedious account (l. i. epist. xi.
      p. 25-31) of a supper at Arles, to which he was invited by
      Majorian, a short time before his death. He had no intention of
      praising a deceased emperor: but a casual disinterested remark,
      “Subrisit Augustus; ut erat, auctoritate servata, cum se
      communioni dedisset, joci plenus,” outweighs the six hundred
      lines of his venal panegyric.]

      It was not, perhaps, without some regret, that Ricimer sacrificed
      his friend to the interest of his ambition: but he resolved, in a
      second choice, to avoid the imprudent preference of superior
      virtue and merit. At his command, the obsequious senate of Rome
      bestowed the Imperial title on Libius Severus, who ascended the
      throne of the West without emerging from the obscurity of a
      private condition. History has scarcely deigned to notice his
      birth, his elevation, his character, or his death. Severus
      expired, as soon as his life became inconvenient to his patron;
      57 and it would be useless to discriminate his nominal reign in
      the vacant interval of six years, between the death of Majorian
      and the elevation of Anthemius. During that period, the
      government was in the hands of Ricimer alone; and, although the
      modest Barbarian disclaimed the name of king, he accumulated
      treasures, formed a separate army, negotiated private alliances,
      and ruled Italy with the same independent and despotic authority,
      which was afterwards exercised by Odoacer and Theodoric. But his
      dominions were bounded by the Alps; and two Roman generals,
      Marcellinus and Aegidius, maintained their allegiance to the
      republic, by rejecting, with disdain, the phantom which he styled
      an emperor. Marcellinus still adhered to the old religion; and
      the devout Pagans, who secretly disobeyed the laws of the church
      and state, applauded his profound skill in the science of
      divination. But he possessed the more valuable qualifications of
      learning, virtue, and courage; 58 the study of the Latin
      literature had improved his taste; and his military talents had
      recommended him to the esteem and confidence of the great Ætius,
      in whose ruin he was involved. By a timely flight, Marcellinus
      escaped the rage of Valentinian, and boldly asserted his liberty
      amidst the convulsions of the Western empire. His voluntary, or
      reluctant, submission to the authority of Majorian, was rewarded
      by the government of Sicily, and the command of an army,
      stationed in that island to oppose, or to attack, the Vandals;
      but his Barbarian mercenaries, after the emperor’s death, were
      tempted to revolt by the artful liberality of Ricimer. At the
      head of a band of faithful followers, the intrepid Marcellinus
      occupied the province of Dalmatia, assumed the title of patrician
      of the West, secured the love of his subjects by a mild and
      equitable reign, built a fleet which claimed the dominion of the
      Adriatic, and alternately alarmed the coasts of Italy and of
      Africa. 59 Aegidius, the master-general of Gaul, who equalled, or
      at least who imitated, the heroes of ancient Rome, 60 proclaimed
      his immortal resentment against the assassins of his beloved
      master. A brave and numerous army was attached to his standard:
      and, though he was prevented by the arts of Ricimer, and the arms
      of the Visigoths, from marching to the gates of Rome, he
      maintained his independent sovereignty beyond the Alps, and
      rendered the name of Aegidius, respectable both in peace and war.
      The Franks, who had punished with exile the youthful follies of
      Childeric, elected the Roman general for their king: his vanity,
      rather than his ambition, was gratified by that singular honor;
      and when the nation, at the end of four years, repented of the
      injury which they had offered to the Merovingian family, he
      patiently acquiesced in the restoration of the lawful prince. The
      authority of Aegidius ended only with his life, and the
      suspicions of poison and secret violence, which derived some
      countenance from the character of Ricimer, were eagerly
      entertained by the passionate credulity of the Gauls. 61

      The kingdom of Italy, a name to which the Western empire was
      gradually reduced, was afflicted, under the reign of Ricimer, by
      the incessant depredations of the Vandal pirates. 62 In the
      spring of each year, they equipped a formidable navy in the port
      of Carthage; and Genseric himself, though in a very advanced age,
      still commanded in person the most important expeditions. His
      designs were concealed with impenetrable secrecy, till the moment
      that he hoisted sail. When he was asked, by his pilot, what
      course he should steer, “Leave the determination to the winds,
      (replied the Barbarian, with pious arrogance;) they will
      transport us to the guilty coast, whose inhabitants have provoked
      the divine justice;” but if Genseric himself deigned to issue
      more precise orders, he judged the most wealthy to be the most
      criminal. The Vandals repeatedly visited the coasts of Spain,
      Liguria, Tuscany, Campania, Lucania, Bruttium, Apulia, Calabria,
      Venetia, Dalmatia, Epirus, Greece, and Sicily: they were tempted
      to subdue the Island of Sardinia, so advantageously placed in the
      centre of the Mediterranean; and their arms spread desolation, or
      terror, from the columns of Hercules to the mouth of the Nile. As
      they were more ambitious of spoil than of glory, they seldom
      attacked any fortified cities, or engaged any regular troops in
      the open field. But the celerity of their motions enabled them,
      almost at the same time, to threaten and to attack the most
      distant objects, which attracted their desires; and as they
      always embarked a sufficient number of horses, they had no sooner
      landed, than they swept the dismayed country with a body of light
      cavalry. Yet, notwithstanding the example of their king, the
      native Vandals and Alani insensibly declined this toilsome and
      perilous warfare; the hardy generation of the first conquerors
      was almost extinguished, and their sons, who were born in Africa,
      enjoyed the delicious baths and gardens which had been acquired
      by the valor of their fathers. Their place was readily supplied
      by a various multitude of Moors and Romans, of captives and
      outlaws; and those desperate wretches, who had already violated
      the laws of their country, were the most eager to promote the
      atrocious acts which disgrace the victories of Genseric. In the
      treatment of his unhappy prisoners, he sometimes consulted his
      avarice, and sometimes indulged his cruelty; and the massacre of
      five hundred noble citizens of Zant or Zacynthus, whose mangled
      bodies he cast into the Ionian Sea, was imputed, by the public
      indignation, to his latest posterity.

      Anthem. Carm. ii. 348-386) In one passage the poet seems inspired
      by his subject, and expresses a strong idea by a lively image:—

     Hinc Vandalus hostis Urget; et in nostrum numerosa classe
     quotannis Militat excidium; conversoque ordine Fati Torrida
     Caucaseos infert mihi Byrsa furores]

      Such crimes could not be excused by any provocations; but the
      war, which the king of the Vandals prosecuted against the Roman
      empire was justified by a specious and reasonable motive. The
      widow of Valentinian, Eudoxia, whom he had led captive from Rome
      to Carthage, was the sole heiress of the Theodosian house; her
      elder daughter, Eudocia, became the reluctant wife of Hunneric,
      his eldest son; and the stern father, asserting a legal claim,
      which could not easily be refuted or satisfied, demanded a just
      proportion of the Imperial patrimony. An adequate, or at least a
      valuable, compensation, was offered by the Eastern emperor, to
      purchase a necessary peace. Eudoxia and her younger daughter,
      Placidia, were honorably restored, and the fury of the Vandals
      was confined to the limits of the Western empire. The Italians,
      destitute of a naval force, which alone was capable of protecting
      their coasts, implored the aid of the more fortunate nations of
      the East; who had formerly acknowledged, in peace and war, the
      supremacy of Rome. But the perpetual divisions of the two empires
      had alienated their interest and their inclinations; the faith of
      a recent treaty was alleged; and the Western Romans, instead of
      arms and ships, could only obtain the assistance of a cold and
      ineffectual mediation. The haughty Ricimer, who had long
      struggled with the difficulties of his situation, was at length
      reduced to address the throne of Constantinople, in the humble
      language of a subject; and Italy submitted, as the price and
      security of the alliance, to accept a master from the choice of
      the emperor of the East. 63 It is not the purpose of the present
      chapter, or even of the present volume, to continue the distinct
      series of the Byzantine history; but a concise view of the reign
      and character of the emperor Leo, may explain the last efforts
      that were attempted to save the falling empire of the West. 64

      distress of Ricimer:—

      solicitation of the river god, transports herself to
      Constantinople, renounces her ancient claims, and implores the
      friendship of Aurora, the goddess of the East. This fabulous
      machinery, which the genius of Claudian had used and abused, is
      the constant and miserable resource of the muse of Sidonius.]

      64 (return) [ The original authors of the reigns of Marcian, Leo,
      and Zeno, are reduced to some imperfect fragments, whose
      deficiencies must be supplied from the more recent compilations
      of Theophanes, Zonaras, and Cedrenus.]

      Since the death of the younger Theodosius, the domestic repose of
      Constantinople had never been interrupted by war or faction.
      Pulcheria had bestowed her hand, and the sceptre of the East, on
      the modest virtue of Marcian: he gratefully reverenced her august
      rank and virgin chastity; and, after her death, he gave his
      people the example of the religious worship that was due to the
      memory of the Imperial saint. 65 Attentive to the prosperity of
      his own dominions, Marcian seemed to behold, with indifference,
      the misfortunes of Rome; and the obstinate refusal of a brave and
      active prince, to draw his sword against the Vandals, was
      ascribed to a secret promise, which had formerly been exacted
      from him when he was a captive in the power of Genseric. 66 The
      death of Marcian, after a reign of seven years, would have
      exposed the East to the danger of a popular election; if the
      superior weight of a single family had not been able to incline
      the balance in favor of the candidate whose interest they
      supported. The patrician Aspar might have placed the diadem on
      his own head, if he would have subscribed the Nicene creed. 67
      During three generations, the armies of the East were
      successively commanded by his father, by himself, and by his son
      Ardaburius; his Barbarian guards formed a military force that
      overawed the palace and the capital; and the liberal distribution
      of his immense treasures rendered Aspar as popular as he was
      powerful. He recommended the obscure name of Leo of Thrace, a
      military tribune, and the principal steward of his household. His
      nomination was unanimously ratified by the senate; and the
      servant of Aspar received the Imperial crown from the hands of
      the patriarch or bishop, who was permitted to express, by this
      unusual ceremony, the suffrage of the Deity. 68 This emperor, the
      first of the name of Leo, has been distinguished by the title of
      the Great; from a succession of princes, who gradually fixed in
      the opinion of the Greeks a very humble standard of heroic, or at
      least of royal, perfection. Yet the temperate firmness with which
      Leo resisted the oppression of his benefactor, showed that he was
      conscious of his duty and of his prerogative. Aspar was
      astonished to find that his influence could no longer appoint a
      præfect of Constantinople: he presumed to reproach his sovereign
      with a breach of promise, and insolently shaking his purple, “It
      is not proper, (said he,) that the man who is invested with this
      garment, should be guilty of lying.” “Nor is it proper, (replied
      Leo,) that a prince should be compelled to resign his own
      judgment, and the public interest, to the will of a subject.”69
      After this extraordinary scene, it was impossible that the
      reconciliation of the emperor and the patrician could be sincere;
      or, at least, that it could be solid and permanent. An army of
      Isaurians 70 was secretly levied, and introduced into
      Constantinople; and while Leo undermined the authority, and
      prepared the disgrace, of the family of Aspar, his mild and
      cautious behavior restrained them from any rash and desperate
      attempts, which might have been fatal to themselves, or their
      enemies. The measures of peace and war were affected by this
      internal revolution. As long as Aspar degraded the majesty of the
      throne, the secret correspondence of religion and interest
      engaged him to favor the cause of Genseric. When Leo had
      delivered himself from that ignominious servitude, he listened to
      the complaints of the Italians; resolved to extirpate the tyranny
      of the Vandals; and declared his alliance with his colleague,
      Anthemius, whom he solemnly invested with the diadem and purple
      of the West.

      The virtues of Anthemius have perhaps been magnified, since the
      Imperial descent, which he could only deduce from the usurper
      Procopius, has been swelled into a line of emperors. 71 But the
      merit of his immediate parents, their honors, and their riches,
      rendered Anthemius one of the most illustrious subjects of the
      East. His father, Procopius, obtained, after his Persian embassy,
      the rank of general and patrician; and the name of Anthemius was
      derived from his maternal grandfather, the celebrated præfect,
      who protected, with so much ability and success, the infant reign
      of Theodosius. The grandson of the præfect was raised above the
      condition of a private subject, by his marriage with Euphemia,
      the daughter of the emperor Marcian. This splendid alliance,
      which might supersede the necessity of merit, hastened the
      promotion of Anthemius to the successive dignities of count, of
      master-general, of consul, and of patrician; and his merit or
      fortune claimed the honors of a victory, which was obtained on
      the banks of the Danube, over the Huns. Without indulging an
      extravagant ambition, the son-in-law of Marcian might hope to be
      his successor; but Anthemius supported the disappointment with
      courage and patience; and his subsequent elevation was
      universally approved by the public, who esteemed him worthy to
      reign, till he ascended the throne. 72 The emperor of the West
      marched from Constantinople, attended by several counts of high
      distinction, and a body of guards almost equal to the strength
      and numbers of a regular army: he entered Rome in triumph, and
      the choice of Leo was confirmed by the senate, the people, and
      the Barbarian confederates of Italy. 73 The solemn inauguration
      of Anthemius was followed by the nuptials of his daughter and the
      patrician Ricimer; a fortunate event, which was considered as the
      firmest security of the union and happiness of the state. The
      wealth of two empires was ostentatiously displayed; and many
      senators completed their ruin, by an expensive effort to disguise
      their poverty. All serious business was suspended during this
      festival; the courts of justice were shut; the streets of Rome,
      the theatres, the places of public and private resort, resounded
      with hymeneal songs and dances: and the royal bride, clothed in
      silken robes, with a crown on her head, was conducted to the
      palace of Ricimer, who had changed his military dress for the
      habit of a consul and a senator. On this memorable occasion,
      Sidonius, whose early ambition had been so fatally blasted,
      appeared as the orator of Auvergne, among the provincial deputies
      who addressed the throne with congratulations or complaints. 74
      The calends of January were now approaching, and the venal poet,
      who had loved Avitus, and esteemed Majorian, was persuaded by his
      friends to celebrate, in heroic verse, the merit, the felicity,
      the second consulship, and the future triumphs, of the emperor
      Anthemius. Sidonius pronounced, with assurance and success, a
      panegyric which is still extant; and whatever might be the
      imperfections, either of the subject or of the composition, the
      welcome flatterer was immediately rewarded with the præfecture
      of Rome; a dignity which placed him among the illustrious
      personages of the empire, till he wisely preferred the more
      respectable character of a bishop and a saint. 75

      states his motive, his labor, and his reward. “Hic ipse

      accepit.” He was made bishop of Clermont, A.D. 471. Tillemont,
      Mem. Eccles. tom. xvi. p. 750.]

      The Greeks ambitiously commend the piety and catholic faith of
      the emperor whom they gave to the West; nor do they forget to
      observe, that when he left Constantinople, he converted his
      palace into the pious foundation of a public bath, a church, and
      a hospital for old men. 76 Yet some suspicious appearances are
      found to sully the theological fame of Anthemius. From the
      conversation of Philotheus, a Macedonian sectary, he had imbibed
      the spirit of religious toleration; and the Heretics of Rome
      would have assembled with impunity, if the bold and vehement
      censure which Pope Hilary pronounced in the church of St. Peter,
      had not obliged him to abjure the unpopular indulgence. 77 Even
      the Pagans, a feeble and obscure remnant, conceived some vain
      hopes, from the indifference, or partiality, of Anthemius; and
      his singular friendship for the philosopher Severus, whom he
      promoted to the consulship, was ascribed to a secret project, of
      reviving the ancient worship of the gods. 78 These idols were
      crumbled into dust: and the mythology which had once been the
      creed of nations, was so universally disbelieved, that it might
      be employed without scandal, or at least without suspicion, by
      Christian poets. 79 Yet the vestiges of superstition were not
      absolutely obliterated, and the festival of the Lupercalia, whose
      origin had preceded the foundation of Rome, was still celebrated
      under the reign of Anthemius. The savage and simple rites were
      expressive of an early state of society before the invention of
      arts and agriculture. The rustic deities who presided over the
      toils and pleasures of the pastoral life, Pan, Faunus, and their
      train of satyrs, were such as the fancy of shepherds might
      create, sportive, petulant, and lascivious; whose power was
      limited, and whose malice was inoffensive. A goat was the
      offering the best adapted to their character and attributes; the
      flesh of the victim was roasted on willow spits; and the riotous
      youths, who crowded to the feast, ran naked about the fields,
      with leather thongs in their hands, communicating, as it was
      supposed, the blessing of fecundity to the women whom they
      touched. 80 The altar of Pan was erected, perhaps by Evander the
      Arcadian, in a dark recess in the side of the Palantine hill,
      watered by a perpetual fountain, and shaded by a hanging grove. A
      tradition, that, in the same place, Romulus and Remus were
      suckled by the wolf, rendered it still more sacred and venerable
      in the eyes of the Romans; and this sylvan spot was gradually
      surrounded by the stately edifices of the Forum. 81 After the
      conversion of the Imperial city, the Christians still continued,
      in the month of February, the annual celebration of the
      Lupercalia; to which they ascribed a secret and mysterious
      influence on the genial powers of the animal and vegetable world.

      The bishops of Rome were solicitous to abolish a profane custom,
      so repugnant to the spirit of Christianity; but their zeal was
      not supported by the authority of the civil magistrate: the
      inveterate abuse subsisted till the end of the fifth century, and
      Pope Gelasius, who purified the capital from the last stain of
      idolatry, appeased by a formal apology, the murmurs of the senate
      and people. 82

      Chapter XXXVI: Total Extinction Of The Western Empire.—Part IV.

      In all his public declarations, the emperor Leo assumes the
      authority, and professes the affection, of a father, for his son
      Anthemius, with whom he had divided the administration of the
      universe. 83 The situation, and perhaps the character, of Leo,
      dissuaded him from exposing his person to the toils and dangers
      of an African war. But the powers of the Eastern empire were
      strenuously exerted to deliver Italy and the Mediterranean from
      the Vandals; and Genseric, who had so long oppressed both the
      land and sea, was threatened from every side with a formidable
      invasion. The campaign was opened by a bold and successful
      enterprise of the præfect Heraclius. 84 The troops of Egypt,
      Thebais, and Libya, were embarked, under his command; and the
      Arabs, with a train of horses and camels, opened the roads of the
      desert. Heraclius landed on the coast of Tripoli, surprised and
      subdued the cities of that province, and prepared, by a laborious
      march, which Cato had formerly executed, 85 to join the Imperial
      army under the walls of Carthage. The intelligence of this loss
      extorted from Genseric some insidious and ineffectual
      propositions of peace; but he was still more seriously alarmed by
      the reconciliation of Marcellinus with the two empires. The
      independent patrician had been persuaded to acknowledge the
      legitimate title of Anthemius, whom he accompanied in his journey
      to Rome; the Dalmatian fleet was received into the harbors of
      Italy; the active valor of Marcellinus expelled the Vandals from
      the Island of Sardinia; and the languid efforts of the West added
      some weight to the immense preparations of the Eastern Romans.
      The expense of the naval armament, which Leo sent against the
      Vandals, has been distinctly ascertained; and the curious and
      instructive account displays the wealth of the declining empire.
      The Royal demesnes, or private patrimony of the prince, supplied
      seventeen thousand pounds of gold; forty-seven thousand pounds of
      gold, and seven hundred thousand of silver, were levied and paid
      into the treasury by the Prætorian præfects. But the cities
      were reduced to extreme poverty; and the diligent calculation of
      fines and forfeitures, as a valuable object of the revenue, does
      not suggest the idea of a just or merciful administration. The
      whole expense, by whatsoever means it was defrayed, of the
      African campaign, amounted to the sum of one hundred and thirty
      thousand pounds of gold, about five millions two hundred thousand
      pounds sterling, at a time when the value of money appears, from
      the comparative price of corn, to have been somewhat higher than
      in the present age. 86 The fleet that sailed from Constantinople
      to Carthage, consisted of eleven hundred and thirteen ships, and
      the number of soldiers and mariners exceeded one hundred thousand
      men. Basiliscus, the brother of the empress Vorina, was intrusted
      with this important command. His sister, the wife of Leo, had
      exaggerated the merit of his former exploits against the
      Scythians. But the discovery of his guilt, or incapacity, was
      reserved for the African war; and his friends could only save his
      military reputation by asserting, that he had conspired with
      Aspar to spare Genseric, and to betray the last hope of the
      Western empire.

      are less certain, and less important. The historian Malchus
      laments the public misery, (Excerpt. ex Suida in Corp. Hist.
      Byzant. p. 58;) but he is surely unjust, when he charges Leo with
      hoarding the treasures which he extorted from the people. * Note:
      Compare likewise the newly-discovered work of Lydus, de
      Magistratibus, ed. Hase, Paris, 1812, (and in the new collection
      of the Byzantines,) l. iii. c. 43. Lydus states the expenditure
      at 65,000 lbs. of gold, 700,000 of silver. But Lydus exaggerates
      the fleet to the incredible number of 10,000 long ships,
      (Liburnae,) and the troops to 400,000 men. Lydus describes this
      fatal measure, of which he charges the blame on Basiliscus, as
      the shipwreck of the state. From that time all the revenues of
      the empire were anticipated; and the finances fell into
      inextricable confusion.—M.]

      Experience has shown, that the success of an invader most
      commonly depends on the vigor and celerity of his operations. The
      strength and sharpness of the first impression are blunted by
      delay; the health and spirit of the troops insensibly languish in
      a distant climate; the naval and military force, a mighty effort
      which perhaps can never be repeated, is silently consumed; and
      every hour that is wasted in negotiation, accustoms the enemy to
      contemplate and examine those hostile terrors, which, on their
      first appearance, he deemed irresistible. The formidable navy of
      Basiliscus pursued its prosperous navigation from the Thracian
      Bosphorus to the coast of Africa. He landed his troops at Cape
      Bona, or the promontory of Mercury, about forty miles from
      Carthage. 87 The army of Heraclius, and the fleet of Marcellinus,
      either joined or seconded the Imperial lieutenant; and the
      Vandals who opposed his progress by sea or land, were
      successively vanquished. 88 If Basiliscus had seized the moment
      of consternation, and boldly advanced to the capital, Carthage
      must have surrendered, and the kingdom of the Vandals was
      extinguished. Genseric beheld the danger with firmness, and
      eluded it with his veteran dexterity. He protested, in the most
      respectful language, that he was ready to submit his person, and
      his dominions, to the will of the emperor; but he requested a
      truce of five days to regulate the terms of his submission; and
      it was universally believed, that his secret liberality
      contributed to the success of this public negotiation. Instead of
      obstinately refusing whatever indulgence his enemy so earnestly
      solicited, the guilty, or the credulous, Basiliscus consented to
      the fatal truce; and his imprudent security seemed to proclaim,
      that he already considered himself as the conqueror of Africa.
      During this short interval, the wind became favorable to the
      designs of Genseric. He manned his largest ships of war with the
      bravest of the Moors and Vandals; and they towed after them many
      large barks, filled with combustible materials. In the obscurity
      of the night, these destructive vessels were impelled against the
      unguarded and unsuspecting fleet of the Romans, who were awakened
      by the sense of their instant danger. Their close and crowded
      order assisted the progress of the fire, which was communicated
      with rapid and irresistible violence; and the noise of the wind,
      the crackling of the flames, the dissonant cries of the soldiers
      and mariners, who could neither command nor obey, increased the
      horror of the nocturnal tumult. Whilst they labored to extricate
      themselves from the fire-ships, and to save at least a part of
      the navy, the galleys of Genseric assaulted them with temperate
      and disciplined valor; and many of the Romans, who escaped the
      fury of the flames, were destroyed or taken by the victorious
      Vandals. Among the events of that disastrous night, the heroic,
      or rather desperate, courage of John, one of the principal
      officers of Basiliscus, has rescued his name from oblivion. When
      the ship, which he had bravely defended, was almost consumed, he
      threw himself in his armor into the sea, disdainfully rejected
      the esteem and pity of Genso, the son of Genseric, who pressed
      him to accept honorable quarter, and sunk under the waves;
      exclaiming, with his last breath, that he would never fall alive
      into the hands of those impious dogs. Actuated by a far different
      spirit, Basiliscus, whose station was the most remote from
      danger, disgracefully fled in the beginning of the engagement,
      returned to Constantinople with the loss of more than half of his
      fleet and army, and sheltered his guilty head in the sanctuary of
      St. Sophia, till his sister, by her tears and entreaties, could
      obtain his pardon from the indignant emperor. Heraclius effected
      his retreat through the desert; Marcellinus retired to Sicily,
      where he was assassinated, perhaps at the instigation of Ricimer,
      by one of his own captains; and the king of the Vandals expressed
      his surprise and satisfaction, that the Romans themselves should
      remove from the world his most formidable antagonists. 89 After
      the failure of this great expedition, 891 Genseric again became
      the tyrant of the sea: the coasts of Italy, Greece, and Asia,
      were again exposed to his revenge and avarice; Tripoli and
      Sardinia returned to his obedience; he added Sicily to the number
      of his provinces; and before he died, in the fulness of years and
      of glory, he beheld the final extinction of the empire of the
      West. 90

      tom. iii. p. 497) has made a judicious observation on the failure
      of these great naval armaments.]

      During his long and active reign, the African monarch had
      studiously cultivated the friendship of the Barbarians of Europe,
      whose arms he might employ in a seasonable and effectual
      diversion against the two empires. After the death of Attila, he
      renewed his alliance with the Visigoths of Gaul; and the sons of
      the elder Theodoric, who successively reigned over that warlike
      nation, were easily persuaded, by the sense of interest, to
      forget the cruel affront which Genseric had inflicted on their
      sister. 91 The death of the emperor Majorian delivered Theodoric
      the Second from the restraint of fear, and perhaps of honor; he
      violated his recent treaty with the Romans; and the ample
      territory of Narbonne, which he firmly united to his dominions,
      became the immediate reward of his perfidy. The selfish policy of
      Ricimer encouraged him to invade the provinces which were in the
      possession of Aegidius, his rival; but the active count, by the
      defence of Arles, and the victory of Orleans, saved Gaul, and
      checked, during his lifetime, the progress of the Visigoths.
      Their ambition was soon rekindled; and the design of
      extinguishing the Roman empire in Spain and Gaul was conceived,
      and almost completed, in the reign of Euric, who assassinated his
      brother Theodoric, and displayed, with a more savage temper,
      superior abilities, both in peace and war. He passed the Pyrenees
      at the head of a numerous army, subdued the cities of Saragossa
      and Pampeluna, vanquished in battle the martial nobles of the
      Tarragonese province, carried his victorious arms into the heart
      of Lusitania, and permitted the Suevi to hold the kingdom of
      Gallicia under the Gothic monarchy of Spain. 92 The efforts of
      Euric were not less vigorous, or less successful, in Gaul; and
      throughout the country that extends from the Pyrenees to the
      Rhone and the Loire, Berry and Auvergne were the only cities, or
      dioceses, which refused to acknowledge him as their master. 93 In
      the defence of Clermont, their principal town, the inhabitants of
      Auvergne sustained, with inflexible resolution, the miseries of
      war, pestilence, and famine; and the Visigoths, relinquishing the
      fruitless siege, suspended the hopes of that important conquest.
      The youth of the province were animated by the heroic, and almost
      incredible, valor of Ecdicius, the son of the emperor Avitus, 94
      who made a desperate sally with only eighteen horsemen, boldly
      attacked the Gothic army, and, after maintaining a flying
      skirmish, retired safe and victorious within the walls of
      Clermont. His charity was equal to his courage: in a time of
      extreme scarcity, four thousand poor were fed at his expense; and
      his private influence levied an army of Burgundians for the
      deliverance of Auvergne. From his virtues alone the faithful
      citizens of Gaul derived any hopes of safety or freedom; and even
      such virtues were insufficient to avert the impending ruin of
      their country, since they were anxious to learn, from his
      authority and example, whether they should prefer the alternative
      of exile or servitude. 95 The public confidence was lost; the
      resources of the state were exhausted; and the Gauls had too much
      reason to believe, that Anthemius, who reigned in Italy, was
      incapable of protecting his distressed subjects beyond the Alps.
      The feeble emperor could only procure for their defence the
      service of twelve thousand British auxiliaries. Riothamus, one of
      the independent kings, or chieftains, of the island, was
      persuaded to transport his troops to the continent of Gaul: he
      sailed up the Loire, and established his quarters in Berry, where
      the people complained of these oppressive allies, till they were
      destroyed or dispersed by the arms of the Visigoths. 96

      One of the last acts of jurisdiction, which the Roman senate
      exercised over their subjects of Gaul, was the trial and
      condemnation of Arvandus, the Prætorian præfect. Sidonius, who
      rejoices that he lived under a reign in which he might pity and
      assist a state criminal, has expressed, with tenderness and
      freedom, the faults of his indiscreet and unfortunate friend. 97
      From the perils which he had escaped, Arvandus imbibed confidence
      rather than wisdom; and such was the various, though uniform,
      imprudence of his behavior, that his prosperity must appear much
      more surprising than his downfall. The second præfecture, which
      he obtained within the term of five years, abolished the merit
      and popularity of his preceding administration. His easy temper
      was corrupted by flattery, and exasperated by opposition; he was
      forced to satisfy his importunate creditors with the spoils of
      the province; his capricious insolence offended the nobles of
      Gaul, and he sunk under the weight of the public hatred. The
      mandate of his disgrace summoned him to justify his conduct
      before the senate; and he passed the Sea of Tuscany with a
      favorable wind, the presage, as he vainly imagined, of his future
      fortunes. A decent respect was still observed for the
      Proefectorian rank; and on his arrival at Rome, Arvandus was
      committed to the hospitality, rather than to the custody, of
      Flavius Asellus, the count of the sacred largesses, who resided
      in the Capitol. 98 He was eagerly pursued by his accusers, the
      four deputies of Gaul, who were all distinguished by their birth,
      their dignities, or their eloquence. In the name of a great
      province, and according to the forms of Roman jurisprudence, they
      instituted a civil and criminal action, requiring such
      restitution as might compensate the losses of individuals, and
      such punishment as might satisfy the justice of the state. Their
      charges of corrupt oppression were numerous and weighty; but they
      placed their secret dependence on a letter which they had
      intercepted, and which they could prove, by the evidence of his
      secretary, to have been dictated by Arvandus himself. The author
      of this letter seemed to dissuade the king of the Goths from a
      peace with the Greek emperor: he suggested the attack of the
      Britons on the Loire; and he recommended a division of Gaul,
      according to the law of nations, between the Visigoths and the
      Burgundians. 99 These pernicious schemes, which a friend could
      only palliate by the reproaches of vanity and indiscretion, were
      susceptible of a treasonable interpretation; and the deputies had
      artfully resolved not to produce their most formidable weapons
      till the decisive moment of the contest. But their intentions
      were discovered by the zeal of Sidonius. He immediately apprised
      the unsuspecting criminal of his danger; and sincerely lamented,
      without any mixture of anger, the haughty presumption of
      Arvandus, who rejected, and even resented, the salutary advice of
      his friends. Ignorant of his real situation, Arvandus showed
      himself in the Capitol in the white robe of a candidate, accepted
      indiscriminate salutations and offers of service, examined the
      shops of the merchants, the silks and gems, sometimes with the
      indifference of a spectator, and sometimes with the attention of
      a purchaser; and complained of the times, of the senate, of the
      prince, and of the delays of justice. His complaints were soon
      removed. An early day was fixed for his trial; and Arvandus
      appeared, with his accusers, before a numerous assembly of the
      Roman senate. The mournful garb which they affected, excited the
      compassion of the judges, who were scandalized by the gay and
      splendid dress of their adversary: and when the præfect
      Arvandus, with the first of the Gallic deputies, were directed to
      take their places on the senatorial benches, the same contrast of
      pride and modesty was observed in their behavior. In this
      memorable judgment, which presented a lively image of the old
      republic, the Gauls exposed, with force and freedom, the
      grievances of the province; and as soon as the minds of the
      audience were sufficiently inflamed, they recited the fatal
      epistle. The obstinacy of Arvandus was founded on the strange
      supposition, that a subject could not be convicted of treason,
      unless he had actually conspired to assume the purple. As the
      paper was read, he repeatedly, and with a loud voice,
      acknowledged it for his genuine composition; and his astonishment
      was equal to his dismay, when the unanimous voice of the senate
      declared him guilty of a capital offence. By their decree, he was
      degraded from the rank of a præfect to the obscure condition of
      a plebeian, and ignominiously dragged by servile hands to the
      public prison. After a fortnight’s adjournment, the senate was
      again convened to pronounce the sentence of his death; but while
      he expected, in the Island of Aesculapius, the expiration of the
      thirty days allowed by an ancient law to the vilest malefactors,
      100 his friends interposed, the emperor Anthemius relented, and
      the præfect of Gaul obtained the milder punishment of exile and
      confiscation. The faults of Arvandus might deserve compassion;
      but the impunity of Seronatus accused the justice of the
      republic, till he was condemned and executed, on the complaint of
      the people of Auvergne. That flagitious minister, the Catiline of
      his age and country, held a secret correspondence with the
      Visigoths, to betray the province which he oppressed: his
      industry was continually exercised in the discovery of new taxes
      and obsolete offences; and his extravagant vices would have
      inspired contempt, if they had not excited fear and abhorrence.

      Such criminals were not beyond the reach of justice; but whatever
      might be the guilt of Ricimer, that powerful Barbarian was able
      to contend or to negotiate with the prince, whose alliance he had
      condescended to accept. The peaceful and prosperous reign which
      Anthemius had promised to the West, was soon clouded by
      misfortune and discord. Ricimer, apprehensive, or impatient, of a
      superior, retired from Rome, and fixed his residence at Milan; an
      advantageous situation either to invite or to repel the warlike
      tribes that were seated between the Alps and the Danube. 102
      Italy was gradually divided into two independent and hostile
      kingdoms; and the nobles of Liguria, who trembled at the near
      approach of a civil war, fell prostrate at the feet of the
      patrician, and conjured him to spare their unhappy country. “For
      my own part,” replied Ricimer, in a tone of insolent moderation,
      “I am still inclined to embrace the friendship of the Galatian;
      103 but who will undertake to appease his anger, or to mitigate
      the pride, which always rises in proportion to our submission?”
      They informed him, that Epiphanius, bishop of Pavia, 104 united
      the wisdom of the serpent with the innocence of the dove; and
      appeared confident, that the eloquence of such an ambassador must
      prevail against the strongest opposition, either of interest or
      passion. Their recommendation was approved; and Epiphanius,
      assuming the benevolent office of mediation, proceeded without
      delay to Rome, where he was received with the honors due to his
      merit and reputation. The oration of a bishop in favor of peace
      may be easily supposed; he argued, that, in all possible
      circumstances, the forgiveness of injuries must be an act of
      mercy, or magnanimity, or prudence; and he seriously admonished
      the emperor to avoid a contest with a fierce Barbarian, which
      might be fatal to himself, and must be ruinous to his dominions.
      Anthemius acknowledged the truth of his maxims; but he deeply
      felt, with grief and indignation, the behavior of Ricimer, and
      his passion gave eloquence and energy to his discourse. “What
      favors,” he warmly exclaimed, “have we refused to this ungrateful
      man? What provocations have we not endured! Regardless of the
      majesty of the purple, I gave my daughter to a Goth; I sacrificed
      my own blood to the safety of the republic. The liberality which
      ought to have secured the eternal attachment of Ricimer has
      exasperated him against his benefactor. What wars has he not
      excited against the empire! How often has he instigated and
      assisted the fury of hostile nations! Shall I now accept his
      perfidious friendship? Can I hope that he will respect the
      engagements of a treaty, who has already violated the duties of a
      son?” But the anger of Anthemius evaporated in these passionate
      exclamations: he insensibly yielded to the proposals of
      Epiphanius; and the bishop returned to his diocese with the
      satisfaction of restoring the peace of Italy, by a
      reconciliation, 105 of which the sincerity and continuance might
      be reasonably suspected. The clemency of the emperor was extorted
      from his weakness; and Ricimer suspended his ambitious designs
      till he had secretly prepared the engines with which he resolved
      to subvert the throne of Anthemius. The mask of peace and
      moderation was then thrown aside. The army of Ricimer was
      fortified by a numerous reenforcement of Burgundians and Oriental
      Suevi: he disclaimed all allegiance to the Greek emperor, marched
      from Milan to the Gates of Rome, and fixing his camp on the banks
      of the Anio, impatiently expected the arrival of Olybrius, his
      Imperial candidate.

      of Epiphanius; and his narrative, verbose and turgid as it must
      appear, illustrates some curious passages in the fall of the
      Western empire.]

      The senator Olybrius, of the Anician family, might esteem himself
      the lawful heir of the Western empire. He had married Placidia,
      the younger daughter of Valentinian, after she was restored by
      Genseric; who still detained her sister Eudoxia, as the wife, or
      rather as the captive, of his son. The king of the Vandals
      supported, by threats and solicitations, the fair pretensions of
      his Roman ally; and assigned, as one of the motives of the war,
      the refusal of the senate and people to acknowledge their lawful
      prince, and the unworthy preference which they had given to a
      stranger. 106 The friendship of the public enemy might render
      Olybrius still more unpopular to the Italians; but when Ricimer
      meditated the ruin of the emperor Anthemius, he tempted, with the
      offer of a diadem, the candidate who could justify his rebellion
      by an illustrious name and a royal alliance. The husband of
      Placidia, who, like most of his ancestors, had been invested with
      the consular dignity, might have continued to enjoy a secure and
      splendid fortune in the peaceful residence of Constantinople; nor
      does he appear to have been tormented by such a genius as cannot
      be amused or occupied, unless by the administration of an empire.
      Yet Olybrius yielded to the importunities of his friends, perhaps
      of his wife; rashly plunged into the dangers and calamities of a
      civil war; and, with the secret connivance of the emperor Leo,
      accepted the Italian purple, which was bestowed, and resumed, at
      the capricious will of a Barbarian. He landed without obstacle
      (for Genseric was master of the sea) either at Ravenna, or the
      port of Ostia, and immediately proceeded to the camp of Ricimer,
      where he was received as the sovereign of the Western world. 107

      restored after the death of Majorian. Perhaps the consulship of
      Olybrius (A.D. 464) was bestowed as a nuptial present.]

      107 (return) [ The hostile appearance of Olybrius is fixed
      (notwithstanding the opinion of Pagi) by the duration of his
      reign. The secret connivance of Leo is acknowledged by Theophanes
      and the Paschal Chronicle. We are ignorant of his motives; but in
      this obscure period, our ignorance extends to the most public and
      important facts.]

      The patrician, who had extended his posts from the Anio to the
      Melvian bridge, already possessed two quarters of Rome, the
      Vatican and the Janiculum, which are separated by the Tyber from
      the rest of the city; 108 and it may be conjectured, that an
      assembly of seceding senators imitated, in the choice of
      Olybrius, the forms of a legal election. But the body of the
      senate and people firmly adhered to the cause of Anthemius; and
      the more effectual support of a Gothic army enabled him to
      prolong his reign, and the public distress, by a resistance of
      three months, which produced the concomitant evils of famine and
      pestilence. At length Ricimer made a furious assault on the
      bridge of Hadrian, or St. Angelo; and the narrow pass was
      defended with equal valor by the Goths, till the death of
      Gilimer, their leader. The victorious troops, breaking down every
      barrier, rushed with irresistible violence into the heart of the
      city, and Rome (if we may use the language of a contemporary
      pope) was subverted by the civil fury of Anthemius and Ricimer.
      109 The unfortunate Anthemius was dragged from his concealment,
      and inhumanly massacred by the command of his son-in-law; who
      thus added a third, or perhaps a fourth, emperor to the number of
      his victims. The soldiers, who united the rage of factious
      citizens with the savage manners of Barbarians, were indulged,
      without control, in the license of rapine and murder: the crowd
      of slaves and plebeians, who were unconcerned in the event, could
      only gain by the indiscriminate pillage; and the face of the city
      exhibited the strange contrast of stern cruelty and dissolute
      intemperance. 110 Forty days after this calamitous event, the
      subject, not of glory, but of guilt, Italy was delivered, by a
      painful disease, from the tyrant Ricimer, who bequeathed the
      command of his army to his nephew Gundobald, one of the princes
      of the Burgundians. In the same year all the principal actors in
      this great revolution were removed from the stage; and the whole
      reign of Olybrius, whose death does not betray any symptoms of
      violence, is included within the term of seven months. He left
      one daughter, the offspring of his marriage with Placidia; and
      the family of the great Theodosius, transplanted from Spain to
      Constantinople, was propagated in the female line as far as the
      eighth generation. 111

      Chapter XXXVI: Total Extinction Of The Western Empire.—Part V.

      Whilst the vacant throne of Italy was abandoned to lawless
      Barbarians, 112 the election of a new colleague was seriously
      agitated in the council of Leo. The empress Verina, studious to
      promote the greatness of her own family, had married one of her
      nieces to Julius Nepos, who succeeded his uncle Marcellinus in
      the sovereignty of Dalmatia, a more solid possession than the
      title which he was persuaded to accept, of Emperor of the West.
      But the measures of the Byzantine court were so languid and
      irresolute, that many months elapsed after the death of
      Anthemius, and even of Olybrius, before their destined successor
      could show himself, with a respectable force, to his Italian
      subjects. During that interval, Glycerius, an obscure soldier,
      was invested with the purple by his patron Gundobald; but the
      Burgundian prince was unable, or unwilling, to support his
      nomination by a civil war: the pursuits of domestic ambition
      recalled him beyond the Alps, 113 and his client was permitted to
      exchange the Roman sceptre for the bishopric of Salona. After
      extinguishing such a competitor, the emperor Nepos was
      acknowledged by the senate, by the Italians, and by the
      provincials of Gaul; his moral virtues, and military talents,
      were loudly celebrated; and those who derived any private benefit
      from his government, announced, in prophetic strains, the
      restoration of the public felicity. 114 Their hopes (if such
      hopes had been entertained) were confounded within the term of a
      single year, and the treaty of peace, which ceded Auvergue to the
      Visigoths, is the only event of his short and inglorious reign.
      The most faithful subjects of Gaul were sacrificed, by the
      Italian emperor, to the hope of domestic security; 115 but his
      repose was soon invaded by a furious sedition of the Barbarian
      confederates, who, under the command of Orestes, their general,
      were in full march from Rome to Ravenna. Nepos trembled at their
      approach; and, instead of placing a just confidence in the
      strength of Ravenna, he hastily escaped to his ships, and retired
      to his Dalmatian principality, on the opposite coast of the
      Adriatic. By this shameful abdication, he protracted his life
      about five years, in a very ambiguous state, between an emperor
      and an exile, till he was assassinated at Salona by the
      ungrateful Glycerius, who was translated, perhaps as the reward
      of his crime, to the archbishopric of Milan. 116

      however, be raised on the identity of the emperor and the
      archbishop.]

      The nations who had asserted their independence after the death
      of Attila, were established, by the right of possession or
      conquest, in the boundless countries to the north of the Danube;
      or in the Roman provinces between the river and the Alps. But the
      bravest of their youth enlisted in the army of confederates, who
      formed the defence and the terror of Italy; 117 and in this
      promiscuous multitude, the names of the Heruli, the Scyrri, the
      Alani, the Turcilingi, and the Rugians, appear to have
      predominated. The example of these warriors was imitated by
      Orestes, 118 the son of Tatullus, and the father of the last
      Roman emperor of the West. Orestes, who has been already
      mentioned in this History, had never deserted his country. His
      birth and fortunes rendered him one of the most illustrious
      subjects of Pannonia. When that province was ceded to the Huns,
      he entered into the service of Attila, his lawful sovereign,
      obtained the office of his secretary, and was repeatedly sent
      ambassador to Constantinople, to represent the person, and
      signify the commands, of the imperious monarch. The death of that
      conqueror restored him to his freedom; and Orestes might
      honorably refuse either to follow the sons of Attila into the
      Scythian desert, or to obey the Ostrogoths, who had usurped the
      dominion of Pannonia. He preferred the service of the Italian
      princes, the successors of Valentinian; and as he possessed the
      qualifications of courage, industry, and experience, he advanced
      with rapid steps in the military profession, till he was
      elevated, by the favor of Nepos himself, to the dignities of
      patrician, and master-general of the troops. These troops had
      been long accustomed to reverence the character and authority of
      Orestes, who affected their manners, conversed with them in their
      own language, and was intimately connected with their national
      chieftains, by long habits of familiarity and friendship. At his
      solicitation they rose in arms against the obscure Greek, who
      presumed to claim their obedience; and when Orestes, from some
      secret motive, declined the purple, they consented, with the same
      facility, to acknowledge his son Augustulus as the emperor of the
      West. By the abdication of Nepos, Orestes had now attained the
      summit of his ambitious hopes; but he soon discovered, before the
      end of the first year, that the lessons of perjury and
      ingratitude, which a rebel must inculcate, will be resorted to
      against himself; and that the precarious sovereign of Italy was
      only permitted to choose, whether he would be the slave, or the
      victim, of his Barbarian mercenaries. The dangerous alliance of
      these strangers had oppressed and insulted the last remains of
      Roman freedom and dignity. At each revolution, their pay and
      privileges were augmented; but their insolence increased in a
      still more extravagant degree; they envied the fortune of their
      brethren in Gaul, Spain, and Africa, whose victorious arms had
      acquired an independent and perpetual inheritance; and they
      insisted on their peremptory demand, that a third part of the
      lands of Italy should be immediately divided among them. Orestes,
      with a spirit, which, in another situation, might be entitled to
      our esteem, chose rather to encounter the rage of an armed
      multitude, than to subscribe the ruin of an innocent people. He
      rejected the audacious demand; and his refusal was favorable to
      the ambition of Odoacer; a bold Barbarian, who assured his
      fellow-soldiers, that, if they dared to associate under his
      command, they might soon extort the justice which had been denied
      to their dutiful petitions. From all the camps and garrisons of
      Italy, the confederates, actuated by the same resentment and the
      same hopes, impatiently flocked to the standard of this popular
      leader; and the unfortunate patrician, overwhelmed by the
      torrent, hastily retreated to the strong city of Pavia, the
      episcopal seat of the holy Epiphanites. Pavia was immediately
      besieged, the fortifications were stormed, the town was pillaged;
      and although the bishop might labor, with much zeal and some
      success, to save the property of the church, and the chastity of
      female captives, the tumult could only be appeased by the
      execution of Orestes. 119 His brother Paul was slain in an action
      near Ravenna; and the helpless Augustulus, who could no longer
      command the respect, was reduced to implore the clemency, of
      Odoacer.

      117 (return) [ Our knowledge of these mercenaries, who subverted
      the Western empire, is derived from Procopius, (de Bell. Gothico,
      l. i. c. i. p. 308.) The popular opinion, and the recent
      historians, represent Odoacer in the false light of a stranger,
      and a king, who invaded Italy with an army of foreigners, his
      native subjects.]

      assertion, that the secretary of Attila was the father of
      Augustulus]

      p. 1669, 1670.) He adds weight to the narrative of Procopius,
      though we may doubt whether the devil actually contrived the
      siege of Pavia, to distress the bishop and his flock.]

      That successful Barbarian was the son of Edecon; who, in some
      remarkable transactions, particularly described in a preceding
      chapter, had been the colleague of Orestes himself. 1191 The
      honor of an ambassador should be exempt from suspicion; and
      Edecon had listened to a conspiracy against the life of his
      sovereign. But this apparent guilt was expiated by his merit or
      repentance; his rank was eminent and conspicuous; he enjoyed the
      favor of Attila; and the troops under his command, who guarded,
      in their turn, the royal village, consisted of a tribe of Scyrri,
      his immediate and hereditary subjects. In the revolt of the
      nations, they still adhered to the Huns; and more than twelve
      years afterwards, the name of Edecon is honorably mentioned, in
      their unequal contests with the Ostrogoths; which was terminated,
      after two bloody battles, by the defeat and dispersion of the
      Scyrri. 120 Their gallant leader, who did not survive this
      national calamity, left two sons, Onulf and Odoacer, to struggle
      with adversity, and to maintain as they might, by rapine or
      service, the faithful followers of their exile. Onulf directed
      his steps towards Constantinople, where he sullied, by the
      assassination of a generous benefactor, the fame which he had
      acquired in arms. His brother Odoacer led a wandering life among
      the Barbarians of Noricum, with a mind and a fortune suited to
      the most desperate adventures; and when he had fixed his choice,
      he piously visited the cell of Severinus, the popular saint of
      the country, to solicit his approbation and blessing. The lowness
      of the door would not admit the lofty stature of Odoacer: he was
      obliged to stoop; but in that humble attitude the saint could
      discern the symptoms of his future greatness; and addressing him
      in a prophetic tone, “Pursue” (said he) “your design; proceed to
      Italy; you will soon cast away this coarse garment of skins; and
      your wealth will be adequate to the liberality of your mind.” 121
      The Barbarian, whose daring spirit accepted and ratified the
      prediction, was admitted into the service of the Western empire,
      and soon obtained an honorable rank in the guards. His manners
      were gradually polished, his military skill was improved, and the
      confederates of Italy would not have elected him for their
      general, unless the exploits of Odoacer had established a high
      opinion of his courage and capacity. 122 Their military
      acclamations saluted him with the title of king; but he
      abstained, during his whole reign, from the use of the purple and
      diadem, 123 lest he should offend those princes, whose subjects,
      by their accidental mixture, had formed the victorious army,
      which time and policy might insensibly unite into a great nation.

      Royalty was familiar to the Barbarians, and the submissive people
      of Italy was prepared to obey, without a murmur, the authority
      which he should condescend to exercise as the vicegerent of the
      emperor of the West. But Odoacer had resolved to abolish that
      useless and expensive office; and such is the weight of antique
      prejudice, that it required some boldness and penetration to
      discover the extreme facility of the enterprise. The unfortunate
      Augustulus was made the instrument of his own disgrace: he
      signified his resignation to the senate; and that assembly, in
      their last act of obedience to a Roman prince, still affected the
      spirit of freedom, and the forms of the constitution. An epistle
      was addressed, by their unanimous decree, to the emperor Zeno,
      the son-in-law and successor of Leo; who had lately been
      restored, after a short rebellion, to the Byzantine throne. They
      solemnly “disclaim the necessity, or even the wish, of continuing
      any longer the Imperial succession in Italy; since, in their
      opinion, the majesty of a sole monarch is sufficient to pervade
      and protect, at the same time, both the East and the West. In
      their own name, and in the name of the people, they consent that
      the seat of universal empire shall be transferred from Rome to
      Constantinople; and they basely renounce the right of choosing
      their master, the only vestige that yet remained of the authority
      which had given laws to the world. The republic (they repeat that
      name without a blush) might safely confide in the civil and
      military virtues of Odoacer; and they humbly request, that the
      emperor would invest him with the title of Patrician, and the
      administration of the diocese of Italy.” The deputies of the
      senate were received at Constantinople with some marks of
      displeasure and indignation: and when they were admitted to the
      audience of Zeno, he sternly reproached them with their treatment
      of the two emperors, Anthemius and Nepos, whom the East had
      successively granted to the prayers of Italy. “The first”
      (continued he) “you have murdered; the second you have expelled;
      but the second is still alive, and whilst he lives he is your
      lawful sovereign.” But the prudent Zeno soon deserted the
      hopeless cause of his abdicated colleague. His vanity was
      gratified by the title of sole emperor, and by the statues
      erected to his honor in the several quarters of Rome; he
      entertained a friendly, though ambiguous, correspondence with the
      patrician Odoacer; and he gratefully accepted the Imperial
      ensigns, the sacred ornaments of the throne and palace, which the
      Barbarian was not unwilling to remove from the sight of the
      people. 124

      some use.]

      In the space of twenty years since the death of Valentinian, nine
      emperors had successively disappeared; and the son of Orestes, a
      youth recommended only by his beauty, would be the least entitled
      to the notice of posterity, if his reign, which was marked by the
      extinction of the Roman empire in the West, did not leave a
      memorable era in the history of mankind. 125 The patrician
      Orestes had married the daughter of Count Romulus, of Petovio in
      Noricum: the name of Augustus, notwithstanding the jealousy of
      power, was known at Aquileia as a familiar surname; and the
      appellations of the two great founders, of the city and of the
      monarchy, were thus strangely united in the last of their
      successors. 126 The son of Orestes assumed and disgraced the
      names of Romulus Augustus; but the first was corrupted into
      Momyllus, by the Greeks, and the second has been changed by the
      Latins into the contemptible diminutive Augustulus. The life of
      this inoffensive youth was spared by the generous clemency of
      Odoacer; who dismissed him, with his whole family, from the
      Imperial palace, fixed his annual allowance at six thousand
      pieces of gold, and assigned the castle of Lucullus, in Campania,
      for the place of his exile or retirement. 127 As soon as the
      Romans breathed from the toils of the Punic war, they were
      attracted by the beauties and the pleasures of Campania; and the
      country-house of the elder Scipio at Liternum exhibited a lasting
      model of their rustic simplicity. 128 The delicious shores of the
      Bay of Naples were crowded with villas; and Sylla applauded the
      masterly skill of his rival, who had seated himself on the lofty
      promontory of Misenum, that commands, on every side, the sea and
      land, as far as the boundaries of the horizon. 129 The villa of
      Marius was purchased, within a few years, by Lucullus, and the
      price had increased from two thousand five hundred, to more than
      fourscore thousand, pounds sterling. 130 It was adorned by the
      new proprietor with Grecian arts and Asiatic treasures; and the
      houses and gardens of Lucullus obtained a distinguished rank in
      the list of Imperial palaces. 131 When the Vandals became
      formidable to the sea-coast, the Lucullan villa, on the
      promontory of Misenum, gradually assumed the strength and
      appellation of a strong castle, the obscure retreat of the last
      emperor of the West. About twenty years after that great
      revolution, it was converted into a church and monastery, to
      receive the bones of St. Severinus. They securely reposed, amidst
      the the broken trophies of Cimbric and Armenian victories,till
      the beginning of the tenth century; when the fortifications,
      which might afford a dangerous shelter to the Saracens, were
      demolished by the people of Naples. 132

      Odoacer was the first Barbarian who reigned in Italy, over a
      people who had once asserted their just superiority above the
      rest of mankind. The disgrace of the Romans still excites our
      respectful compassion, and we fondly sympathize with the
      imaginary grief and indignation of their degenerate posterity.
      But the calamities of Italy had gradually subdued the proud
      consciousness of freedom and glory. In the age of Roman virtue
      the provinces were subject to the arms, and the citizens to the
      laws, of the republic; till those laws were subverted by civil
      discord, and both the city and the province became the servile
      property of a tyrant. The forms of the constitution, which
      alleviated or disguised their abject slavery, were abolished by
      time and violence; the Italians alternately lamented the presence
      or the absence of the sovereign, whom they detested or despised;
      and the succession of five centuries inflicted the various evils
      of military license, capricious despotism, and elaborate
      oppression. During the same period, the Barbarians had emerged
      from obscurity and contempt, and the warriors of Germany and
      Scythia were introduced into the provinces, as the servants, the
      allies, and at length the masters, of the Romans, whom they
      insulted or protected. The hatred of the people was suppressed by
      fear; they respected the spirit and splendor of the martial
      chiefs who were invested with the honors of the empire; and the
      fate of Rome had long depended on the sword of those formidable
      strangers. The stern Ricimer, who trampled on the ruins of Italy,
      had exercised the power, without assuming the title, of a king;
      and the patient Romans were insensibly prepared to acknowledge
      the royalty of Odoacer and his Barbaric successors. The king of
      Italy was not unworthy of the high station to which his valor and
      fortune had exalted him: his savage manners were polished by the
      habits of conversation; and he respected, though a conqueror and
      a Barbarian, the institutions, and even the prejudices, of his
      subjects. After an interval of seven years, Odoacer restored the
      consulship of the West. For himself, he modestly, or proudly,
      declined an honor which was still accepted by the emperors of the
      East; but the curule chair was successively filled by eleven of
      the most illustrious senators; 133 and the list is adorned by the
      respectable name of Basilius, whose virtues claimed the
      friendship and grateful applause of Sidonius, his client. 134 The
      laws of the emperors were strictly enforced, and the civil
      administration of Italy was still exercised by the Prætorian
      præfect and his subordinate officers. Odoacer devolved on the
      Roman magistrates the odious and oppressive task of collecting
      the public revenue; but he reserved for himself the merit of
      seasonable and popular indulgence. 135 Like the rest of the
      Barbarians, he had been instructed in the Arian heresy; but he
      revered the monastic and episcopal characters; and the silence of
      the Catholics attest the toleration which they enjoyed. The peace
      of the city required the interposition of his præfect Basilius
      in the choice of a Roman pontiff: the decree which restrained the
      clergy from alienating their lands was ultimately designed for
      the benefit of the people, whose devotions would have been taxed
      to repair the dilapidations of the church. 136 Italy was
      protected by the arms of its conqueror; and its frontiers were
      respected by the Barbarians of Gaul and Germany, who had so long
      insulted the feeble race of Theodosius. Odoacer passed the
      Adriatic, to chastise the assassins of the emperor Nepos, and to
      acquire the maritime province of Dalmatia. He passed the Alps, to
      rescue the remains of Noricum from Fava, or Feletheus, king of
      the Rugians, who held his residence beyond the Danube. The king
      was vanquished in battle, and led away prisoner; a numerous
      colony of captives and subjects was transplanted into Italy; and
      Rome, after a long period of defeat and disgrace, might claim the
      triumph of her Barbarian master. 137

      (Hist. des Peuples, &c., tom. viii. c. 1, 4, 8, 9) has diligently
      studied, illustrates the ruin of Noricum and the Bavarian
      antiquities]

      Notwithstanding the prudence and success of Odoacer, his kingdom
      exhibited the sad prospect of misery and desolation. Since the
      age of Tiberius, the decay of agriculture had been felt in Italy;
      and it was a just subject of complaint, that the life of the
      Roman people depended on the accidents of the winds and waves.
      138 In the division and the decline of the empire, the tributary
      harvests of Egypt and Africa were withdrawn; the numbers of the
      inhabitants continually diminished with the means of subsistence;
      and the country was exhausted by the irretrievable losses of war,
      famine, 139 and pestilence. St. Ambrose has deplored the ruin of
      a populous district, which had been once adorned with the
      flourishing cities of Bologna, Modena, Regium, and Placentia. 140
      Pope Gelasius was a subject of Odoacer; and he affirms, with
      strong exaggeration, that in Aemilia, Tuscany, and the adjacent
      provinces, the human species was almost extirpated. 141 The
      plebeians of Rome, who were fed by the hand of their master,
      perished or disappeared, as soon as his liberality was
      suppressed; the decline of the arts reduced the industrious
      mechanic to idleness and want; and the senators, who might
      support with patience the ruin of their country, bewailed their
      private loss of wealth and luxury. 1411 One third of those ample
      estates, to which the ruin of Italy is originally imputed, 142
      was extorted for the use of the conquerors. Injuries were
      aggravated by insults; the sense of actual sufferings was
      imbittered by the fear of more dreadful evils; and as new lands
      were allotted to the new swarms of Barbarians, each senator was
      apprehensive lest the arbitrary surveyors should approach his
      favorite villa, or his most profitable farm. The least
      unfortunate were those who submitted without a murmur to the
      power which it was impossible to resist. Since they desired to
      live, they owed some gratitude to the tyrant who had spared their
      lives; and since he was the absolute master of their fortunes,
      the portion which he left must be accepted as his pure and
      voluntary gift. 143 The distress of Italy 1431 was mitigated by
      the prudence and humanity of Odoacer, who had bound himself, as
      the price of his elevation, to satisfy the demands of a
      licentious and turbulent multitude. The kings of the Barbarians
      were frequently resisted, deposed, or murdered, by their native
      subjects, and the various bands of Italian mercenaries, who
      associated under the standard of an elective general, claimed a
      larger privilege of freedom and rapine. A monarchy destitute of
      national union, and hereditary right, hastened to its
      dissolution. After a reign of fourteen years, Odoacer was
      oppressed by the superior genius of Theodoric, king of the
      Ostrogoths; a hero alike excellent in the arts of war and of
      government, who restored an age of peace and prosperity, and
      whose name still excites and deserves the attention of mankind.

      imposts, on which the pay of the soldiery depended, but not even
      a certain supply of the necessaries of life. The neighboring
      countries were now occupied by warlike nations; the supplies of
      corn from Africa were cut off; foreign commerce nearly destroyed;
      they could not look for supplies beyond the limits of Italy,
      throughout which the agriculture had been long in a state of
      progressive but rapid depression. (Denina, Rev. d’Italia t. v. c.
