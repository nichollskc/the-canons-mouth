Chapter XV: Progress Of The Christian Religion.—Part I.

     The Progress Of The Christian Religion, And The Sentiments,
     Manners, Numbers, And Condition Of The Primitive Christians. 101

      101 (return) [ In spite of my resolution, Lardner led me to look
      through the famous fifteenth and sixteenth chapters of Gibbon. I
      could not lay them down without finishing them. The causes
      assigned, in the fifteenth chapter, for the diffusion of
      Christianity, must, no doubt, have contributed to it materially;
      but I doubt whether he saw them all. Perhaps those which he
      enumerates are among the most obvious. They might all be safely
      adopted by a Christian writer, with some change in the language
      and manner. Mackintosh see Life, i. p. 244.—M.]

      A candid but rational inquiry into the progress and establishment
      of Christianity may be considered as a very essential part of the
      history of the Roman empire. While that great body was invaded by
      open violence, or undermined by slow decay, a pure and humble
      religion gently insinuated itself into the minds of men, grew up
      in silence and obscurity, derived new vigor from opposition, and
      finally erected the triumphant banner of the Cross on the ruins
      of the Capitol. Nor was the influence of Christianity confined to
      the period or to the limits of the Roman empire. After a
      revolution of thirteen or fourteen centuries, that religion is
      still professed by the nations of Europe, the most distinguished
      portion of human kind in arts and learning as well as in arms. By
      the industry and zeal of the Europeans, it has been widely
      diffused to the most distant shores of Asia and Africa; and by
      the means of their colonies has been firmly established from
      Canada to Chili, in a world unknown to the ancients.

      But this inquiry, however useful or entertaining, is attended
      with two peculiar difficulties. The scanty and suspicious
      materials of ecclesiastical history seldom enable us to dispel
      the dark cloud that hangs over the first age of the church. The
      great law of impartiality too often obliges us to reveal the
      imperfections of the uninspired teachers and believers of the
      gospel; and, to a careless observer, _their_ faults may seem to
      cast a shade on the faith which they professed. But the scandal
      of the pious Christian, and the fallacious triumph of the
      Infidel, should cease as soon as they recollect not only _by
      whom_, but likewise _to whom_, the Divine Revelation was given.
      The theologian may indulge the pleasing task of describing
      Religion as she descended from Heaven, arrayed in her native
      purity. A more melancholy duty is imposed on the historian. He
      must discover the inevitable mixture of error and corruption,
      which she contracted in a long residence upon earth, among a weak
      and degenerate race of beings. 102

      102 (return) [ The art of Gibbon, or at least the unfair
      impression produced by these two memorable chapters, consists in
      confounding together, in one undistinguishable mass, the origin
      and apostolic propagation of the Christian religion with its
      later progress. The main question, the divine origin of the
      religion, is dexterously eluded or speciously conceded; his plan
      enables him to commence his account, in most parts, below the
      apostolic times; and it is only by the strength of the dark
      coloring with which he has brought out the failings and the
      follies of succeeding ages, that a shadow of doubt and suspicion
      is thrown back on the primitive period of Christianity. Divest
      this whole passage of the latent sarcasm betrayed by the
      subsequent one of the whole disquisition, and it might commence a
      Christian history, written in the most Christian spirit of
      candor.—M.]

      Our curiosity is naturally prompted to inquire by what means the
      Christian faith obtained so remarkable a victory over the
      established religions of the earth. To this inquiry, an obvious
      but satisfactory answer may be returned; that it was owing to the
      convincing evidence of the doctrine itself, and to the ruling
      providence of its great Author. But as truth and reason seldom
      find so favorable a reception in the world, and as the wisdom of
      Providence frequently condescends to use the passions of the
      human heart, and the general circumstances of mankind, as
      instruments to execute its purpose, we may still be permitted,
      though with becoming submission, to ask, not indeed what were the
      first, but what were the secondary causes of the rapid growth of
      the Christian church. It will, perhaps, appear, that it was most
      effectually favored and assisted by the five following causes:

      I. The inflexible, and if we may use the expression, the
      intolerant zeal of the Christians, derived, it is true, from the
      Jewish religion, but purified from the narrow and unsocial
      spirit, which, instead of inviting, had deterred the Gentiles
      from embracing the law of Moses.1023

      II. The doctrine of a future life, improved by every additional
      circumstance which could give weight and efficacy to that
      important truth. III. The miraculous powers ascribed to the
      primitive church. IV. The pure and austere morals of the
      Christians.

      V. The union and discipline of the Christian republic, which
      gradually formed an independent and increasing state in the heart
      of the Roman empire.

      1023 (return) [Though we are thus far agreed with respect to the
      inflexibility and intolerance of Christian zeal, yet as to the
      principle from which it was derived, we are, toto cœlo, divided
      in opinion. You deduce it from the Jewish religion; I would refer
      it to a more adequate and a more obvious source, a full
      persuasion of the truth of Christianity. Watson. Letters Gibbon,
      i. 9.—M.]

      I. We have already described the religious harmony of the ancient
      world, and the facility with which the most different and even
      hostile nations embraced, or at least respected, each other’s
      superstitions. A single people refused to join in the common
      intercourse of mankind. The Jews, who, under the Assyrian and
      Persian monarchies, had languished for many ages the most
      despised portion of their slaves, 1 emerged from obscurity under
      the successors of Alexander; and as they multiplied to a
      surprising degree in the East, and afterwards in the West, they
      soon excited the curiosity and wonder of other nations. 2 The
      sullen obstinacy with which they maintained their peculiar rites
      and unsocial manners seemed to mark them out as a distinct
      species of men, who boldly professed, or who faintly disguised,
      their implacable habits to the rest of human kind. 3 Neither the
      violence of Antiochus, nor the arts of Herod, nor the example of
      the circumjacent nations, could ever persuade the Jews to
      associate with the institutions of Moses the elegant mythology of
      the Greeks. 4 According to the maxims of universal toleration,
      the Romans protected a superstition which they despised. 5 The
      polite Augustus condescended to give orders, that sacrifices
      should be offered for his prosperity in the temple of Jerusalem;
      6 whilst the meanest of the posterity of Abraham, who should have
      paid the same homage to the Jupiter of the Capitol, would have
      been an object of abhorrence to himself and to his brethren.

      But the moderation of the conquerors was insufficient to appease
      the jealous prejudices of their subjects, who were alarmed and
      scandalized at the ensigns of paganism, which necessarily
      introduced themselves into a Roman province. 7 The mad attempt of
      Caligula to place his own statue in the temple of Jerusalem was
      defeated by the unanimous resolution of a people who dreaded
      death much less than such an idolatrous profanation. 8 Their
      attachment to the law of Moses was equal to their detestation of
      foreign religions. The current of zeal and devotion, as it was
      contracted into a narrow channel, ran with the strength, and
      sometimes with the fury, of a torrent. This facility has not
      always prevented intolerance, which seems inherent in the
      religious spirit, when armed with authority. The separation of
      the ecclesiastical and civil power, appears to be the only means
      of at once maintaining religion and tolerance: but this is a very
      modern notion. The passions, which mingle themselves with
      opinions, made the Pagans very often intolerant and persecutors;
      witness the Persians, the Egyptians even the Greeks and Romans.

      1st. The Persians.—Cambyses, conqueror of the Egyptians,
      condemned to death the magistrates of Memphis, because they had
      offered divine honors to their god. Apis: he caused the god to be
      brought before him, struck him with his dagger, commanded the
      priests to be scourged, and ordered a general massacre of all the
      Egyptians who should be found celebrating the festival of the
      statues of the gods to be burnt. Not content with this
      intolerance, he sent an army to reduce the Ammonians to slavery,
      and to set on fire the temple in which Jupiter delivered his
      oracles. See Herod. iii. 25—29, 37. Xerxes, during his invasion
      of Greece, acted on the same principles: l c destroyed all the
      temples of Greece and Ionia, except that of Ephesus. See Paus. l.
      vii. p. 533, and x. p. 887.

      Strabo, l. xiv. b. 941. 2d. The Egyptians.—They thought
      themselves defiled when they had drunk from the same cup or eaten
      at the same table with a man of a different belief from their
      own. “He who has voluntarily killed any sacred animal is punished
      with death; but if any one, even involuntarily, has killed a cat
      or an ibis, he cannot escape the extreme penalty: the people drag
      him away, treat him in the most cruel manner, sometimes without
      waiting for a judicial sentence. * * * Even at the time when King
      Ptolemy was not yet the acknowledged friend of the Roman people,
      while the multitude were paying court with all possible attention
      to the strangers who came from Italy * * a Roman having killed a
      cat, the people rushed to his house, and neither the entreaties
      of the nobles, whom the king sent to them, nor the terror of the
      Roman name, were sufficiently powerful to rescue the man from
      punishment, though he had committed the crime involuntarily.”
      Diod. Sic. i 83. Juvenal, in his 13th Satire, describes the
      sanguinary conflict between the inhabitants of Ombos and of
      Tentyra, from religious animosity. The fury was carried so far,
      that the conquerors tore and devoured the quivering limbs of the
      conquered.

      Ardet adhuc Ombos et Tentyra, summus utrinque Inde furor vulgo,
      quod numina vicinorum Odit uterque locus; quum solos credat
      habendos Esse Deos quos ipse colit. Sat. xv. v. 85.

      3d. The Greeks.—“Let us not here,” says the Abbé Guénée, “refer
      to the cities of Peloponnesus and their severity against atheism;
      the Ephesians prosecuting Heraclitus for impiety; the Greeks
      armed one against the other by religious zeal, in the
      Amphictyonic war. Let us say nothing either of the frightful
      cruelties inflicted by three successors of Alexander upon the
      Jews, to force them to abandon their religion, nor of Antiochus
      expelling the philosophers from his states. Let us not seek our
      proofs of intolerance so far off. Athens, the polite and learned
      Athens, will supply us with sufficient examples. Every citizen
      made a public and solemn vow to conform to the religion of his
      country, to defend it, and to cause it to be respected. An
      express law severely punished all discourses against the gods,
      and a rigid decree ordered the denunciation of all who should
      deny their existence. * * * The practice was in unison with the
      severity of the law. The proceedings commenced against
      Protagoras; a price set upon the head of Diagoras; the danger of
      Alcibiades; Aristotle obliged to fly; Stilpo banished; Anaxagoras
      hardly escaping death; Pericles himself, after all his services
      to his country, and all the glory he had acquired, compelled to
      appear before the tribunals and make his defence; * * a priestess
      executed for having introduced strange gods; Socrates condemned
      and drinking the hemlock, because he was accused of not
      recognizing those of his country, &c.; these facts attest too
      loudly, to be called in question, the religious intolerance of
      the most humane and enlightened people in Greece.” Lettres de
      quelques Juifs a Mons. Voltaire, i. p. 221. (Compare Bentley on
      Freethinking, from which much of this is derived.)—M.

      4th. The Romans.—The laws of Rome were not less express and
      severe. The intolerance of foreign religions reaches, with the
      Romans, as high as the laws of the twelve tables; the
      prohibitions were afterwards renewed at different times.
      Intolerance did not discontinue under the emperors; witness the
      counsel of Mæcenas to Augustus. This counsel is so remarkable,
      that I think it right to insert it entire. “Honor the gods
      yourself,” says Mæcenas to Augustus, “in every way according to
      the usage of your ancestors, and compel others to worship them.
      Hate and punish those who introduce strange gods, not only for
      the sake of the gods, (he who despises them will respect no one,)
      but because those who introduce new gods engage a multitude of
      persons in foreign laws and customs. From hence arise unions
      bound by oaths and confederacies, and associations, things
      dangerous to a monarchy.” Dion Cass. l. ii. c. 36. (But, though
      some may differ from it, see Gibbon’s just observation on this
      passage in Dion Cassius, ch. xvi. note 117; impugned, indeed, by
      M. Guizot, note in loc.)—M.

      Even the laws which the philosophers of Athens and of Rome wrote
      for their imaginary republics are intolerant. Plato does not
      leave to his citizens freedom of religious worship; and Cicero
      expressly prohibits them from having other gods than those of the
      state. Lettres de quelques Juifs a Mons. Voltaire, i. p. 226.—G.

      According to M. Guizot’s just remarks, religious intolerance will
      always ally itself with the passions of man, however different
      those passions may be. In the instances quoted above, with the
      Persians it was the pride of despotism; to conquer the gods of a
      country was the last mark of subjugation. With the Egyptians, it
      was the gross Fetichism of the superstitious populace, and the
      local jealousy of neighboring towns. In Greece, persecution was
      in general connected with political party; in Rome, with the
      stern supremacy of the law and the interests of the state. Gibbon
      has been mistaken in attributing to the tolerant spirit of
      Paganism that which arose out of the peculiar circumstances of
      the times. 1st. The decay of the old Polytheism, through the
      progress of reason and intelligence, and the prevalence of
      philosophical opinions among the higher orders.

      2d. The Roman character, in which the political always
      predominated over the religious party. The Romans were contented
      with having bowed the world to a uniformity of subjection to
      their power, and cared not for establishing the (to them) less
      important uniformity of religion.—M.

      present volume of Moses. But the wise, the humane Maimonides
      openly teaches that if an idolater fall into the water, a Jew
      ought not to save him from instant death. See Basnage, Histoire
      des Juifs, l. vi. c. 28. * Note: It is diametrically opposed to
      its spirit and to its letter, see, among other passages, Deut. v.

      in the land of Egypt.” Comp. Lev. xxiii. 25. Juvenal is a
      satirist, whose strong expressions can hardly be received as
      historic evidence; and he wrote after the horrible cruelties of
      the Romans, which, during and after the war, might give some
      cause for the complete isolation of the Jew from the rest of the
      world. The Jew was a bigot, but his religion was not the only
      source of his bigotry. After how many centuries of mutual wrong
      and hatred, which had still further estranged the Jew from
      mankind, did Maimonides write?—M.]

      of occasional conformity, derived from Herod, by whose example
      and authority they had been seduced, the name of Herodians. But
      their numbers were so inconsiderable, and their duration so
      short, that Josephus has not thought them worthy of his notice.
      See Prideaux’s Connection, vol. ii. p. 285. * Note: The Herodians
      were probably more of a political party than a religious sect,

      8 (return) [ Jussi a Caio Cæsare, effigiem ejus in templo locare,
      arma potius sumpsere. Tacit. Hist. v. 9. Philo and Josephus gave
      a very circumstantial, but a very rhetorical, account of this
      transaction, which exceedingly perplexed the governor of Syria.
      At the first mention of this idolatrous proposal, King Agrippa
      fainted away; and did not recover his senses until the third day.
      (Hist. of Jews, ii. 181, &c.)]

      This inflexible perseverance, which appeared so odious or so
      ridiculous to the ancient world, assumes a more awful character,
      since Providence has deigned to reveal to us the mysterious
      history of the chosen people. But the devout and even scrupulous
      attachment to the Mosaic religion, so conspicuous among the Jews
      who lived under the second temple, becomes still more surprising,
      if it is compared with the stubborn incredulity of their
      forefathers. When the law was given in thunder from Mount Sinai,
      when the tides of the ocean and the course of the planets were
      suspended for the convenience of the Israelites, and when
      temporal rewards and punishments were the immediate consequences
      of their piety or disobedience, they perpetually relapsed into
      rebellion against the visible majesty of their Divine King,
      placed the idols of the nations in the sanctuary of Jehovah, and
      imitated every fantastic ceremony that was practised in the tents
      of the Arabs, or in the cities of Phœnicia. 9 As the protection
      of Heaven was deservedly withdrawn from the ungrateful race,
      their faith acquired a proportionable degree of vigor and purity.

      The contemporaries of Moses and Joshua had beheld with careless
      indifference the most amazing miracles. Under the pressure of
      every calamity, the belief of those miracles has preserved the
      Jews of a later period from the universal contagion of idolatry;
      and in contradiction to every known principle of the human mind,
      that singular people seems to have yielded a stronger and more
      ready assent to the traditions of their remote ancestors, than to
      the evidence of their own senses. 10

      9 (return) [ For the enumeration of the Syrian and Arabian
      deities, it may be observed, that Milton has comprised in one
      hundred and thirty very beautiful lines the two large and learned
      syntagmas which Selden had composed on that abstruse subject.]

      10 (return) [ “How long will this people provoke me? and how long
      will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have
      shown among them?” (Numbers xiv. 11.) It would be easy, but it
      would be unbecoming, to justify the complaint of the Deity from
      the whole tenor of the Mosaic history. Note: Among a rude and
      barbarous people, religious impressions are easily made, and are
      as soon effaced. The ignorance which multiplies imaginary
      wonders, would weaken and destroy the effect of real miracle. At
      the period of the Jewish history, referred to in the passage from
      Numbers, their fears predominated over their faith,—the fears of
      an unwarlike people, just rescued from debasing slavery, and
      commanded to attack a fierce, a well-armed, a gigantic, and a far
      more numerous race, the inhabitants of Canaan. As to the frequent
      apostasy of the Jews, their religion was beyond their state of
      civilization. Nor is it uncommon for a people to cling with
      passionate attachment to that of which, at first, they could not
      appreciate the value. Patriotism and national pride will contend,
      even to death, for political rights which have been forced upon a
      reluctant people. The Christian may at least retort, with
      justice, that the great sign of his religion, the resurrection of
      Jesus, was most ardently believed, and most resolutely asserted,
      by the eye witnesses of the fact.—M.]

      The Jewish religion was admirably fitted for defence, but it was
      never designed for conquest; and it seems probable that the
      number of proselytes was never much superior to that of
      apostates. The divine promises were originally made, and the
      distinguishing rite of circumcision was enjoined, to a single
      family. When the posterity of Abraham had multiplied like the
      sands of the sea, the Deity, from whose mouth they received a
      system of laws and ceremonies, declared himself the proper and as
      it were the national God of Israel; and with the most jealous
      care separated his favorite people from the rest of mankind. The
      conquest of the land of Canaan was accompanied with so many
      wonderful and with so many bloody circumstances, that the
      victorious Jews were left in a state of irreconcilable hostility
      with all their neighbors. They had been commanded to extirpate
      some of the most idolatrous tribes, and the execution of the
      divine will had seldom been retarded by the weakness of humanity.

      With the other nations they were forbidden to contract any
      marriages or alliances; and the prohibition of receiving them
      into the congregation, which in some cases was perpetual, almost
      always extended to the third, to the seventh, or even to the
      tenth generation. The obligation of preaching to the Gentiles the
      faith of Moses had never been inculcated as a precept of the law,
      nor were the Jews inclined to impose it on themselves as a
      voluntary duty.

      In the admission of new citizens that unsocial people was
      actuated by the selfish vanity of the Greeks, rather than by the
      generous policy of Rome. The descendants of Abraham were
      flattered by the opinion that they alone were the heirs of the
      covenant, and they were apprehensive of diminishing the value of
      their inheritance by sharing it too easily with the strangers of
      the earth. A larger acquaintance with mankind extended their
      knowledge without correcting their prejudices; and whenever the
      God of Israel acquired any new votaries, he was much more
      indebted to the inconstant humor of polytheism than to the active
      zeal of his own missionaries. 11 The religion of Moses seems to
      be instituted for a particular country as well as for a single
      nation; and if a strict obedience had been paid to the order,
      that every male, three times in the year, should present himself
      before the Lord Jehovah, it would have been impossible that the
      Jews could ever have spread themselves beyond the narrow limits
      of the promised land. 12 That obstacle was indeed removed by the
      destruction of the temple of Jerusalem; but the most considerable
      part of the Jewish religion was involved in its destruction; and
      the Pagans, who had long wondered at the strange report of an
      empty sanctuary, 13 were at a loss to discover what could be the
      object, or what could be the instruments, of a worship which was
      destitute of temples and of altars, of priests and of sacrifices.

      Yet even in their fallen state, the Jews, still asserting their
      lofty and exclusive privileges, shunned, instead of courting, the
      society of strangers. They still insisted with inflexible rigor
      on those parts of the law which it was in their power to
      practise. Their peculiar distinctions of days, of meats, and a
      variety of trivial though burdensome observances, were so many
      objects of disgust and aversion for the other nations, to whose
      habits and prejudices they were diametrically opposite. The
      painful and even dangerous rite of circumcision was alone capable
      of repelling a willing proselyte from the door of the synagogue.

      Under these circumstances, Christianity offered itself to the
      world, armed with the strength of the Mosaic law, and delivered
      from the weight of its fetters. An exclusive zeal for the truth
      of religion, and the unity of God, was as carefully inculcated in
      the new as in the ancient system; and whatever was now revealed
      to mankind concerning the nature and designs of the Supreme Being
      was fitted to increase their reverence for that mysterious
      doctrine. The divine authority of Moses and the prophets was
      admitted, and even established, as the firmest basis of
      Christianity. From the beginning of the world, an uninterrupted
      series of predictions had announced and prepared the
      long-expected coming of the Messiah, who, in compliance with the
      gross apprehensions of the Jews, had been more frequently
      represented under the character of a King and Conqueror, than
      under that of a Prophet, a Martyr, and the Son of God. By his
      expiatory sacrifice, the imperfect sacrifices of the temple were
      at once consummated and abolished. The ceremonial law, which
      consisted only of types and figures, was succeeded by a pure and
      spiritual worship equally adapted to all climates, as well as to
      every condition of mankind; and to the initiation of blood was
      substituted a more harmless initiation of water. The promise of
      divine favor, instead of being partially confined to the
      posterity of Abraham, was universally proposed to the freeman and
      the slave, to the Greek and to the barbarian, to the Jew and to
      the Gentile. Every privilege that could raise the proselyte from
      earth to heaven, that could exalt his devotion, secure his
      happiness, or even gratify that secret pride which, under the
      semblance of devotion, insinuates itself into the human heart,
      was still reserved for the members of the Christian church; but
      at the same time all mankind was permitted, and even solicited,
      to accept the glorious distinction, which was not only proffered
      as a favor, but imposed as an obligation. It became the most
      sacred duty of a new convert to diffuse among his friends and
      relations the inestimable blessing which he had received, and to
      warn them against a refusal that would be severely punished as a
      criminal disobedience to the will of a benevolent but
      all-powerful Deity.




      Chapter XV: Progress Of The Christian Religion.—Part II.

      The enfranchisement of the church from the bonds of the synagogue
      was a work, however, of some time and of some difficulty. The
      Jewish converts, who acknowledged Jesus in the character of the
      Messiah foretold by their ancient oracles, respected him as a
      prophetic teacher of virtue and religion; but they obstinately
      adhered to the ceremonies of their ancestors, and were desirous
      of imposing them on the Gentiles, who continually augmented the
      number of believers. These Judaizing Christians seem to have
      argued with some degree of plausibility from the divine origin of
      the Mosaic law, and from the immutable perfections of its great
      Author. They affirmed, that if the Being, who is the same through
      all eternity, had designed to abolish those sacred rites which
      had served to distinguish his chosen people, the repeal of them
      would have been no less clear and solemn than their first
      promulgation: _that_, instead of those frequent declarations,
      which either suppose or assert the perpetuity of the Mosaic
      religion, it would have been represented as a provisionary scheme
      intended to last only to the coming of the Messiah, who should
      instruct mankind in a more perfect mode of faith and of worship:
      15 _that_ the Messiah himself, and his disciples who conversed
      with him on earth, instead of authorizing by their example the
      most minute observances of the Mosaic law, 16 would have
      published to the world the abolition of those useless and
      obsolete ceremonies, without suffering Christianity to remain
      during so many years obscurely confounded among the sects of the
      Jewish church. Arguments like these appear to have been used in
      the defence of the expiring cause of the Mosaic law; but the
      industry of our learned divines has abundantly explained the
      ambiguous language of the Old Testament, and the ambiguous
      conduct of the apostolic teachers. It was proper gradually to
      unfold the system of the gospel, and to pronounce, with the
      utmost caution and tenderness, a sentence of condemnation so
      repugnant to the inclination and prejudices of the believing
      Jews.

      15 (return) [ These arguments were urged with great ingenuity by
      the Jew Orobio, and refuted with equal ingenuity and candor by
      the Christian Limborch. See the Amica Collatio, (it well deserves

      Veritate Religionis Christianæ, l. v. c. 7. A little afterwards,
      (c. 12,) he expatiates on the condescension of the apostles.]

      The history of the church of Jerusalem affords a lively proof of
      the necessity of those precautions, and of the deep impression
      which the Jewish religion had made on the minds of its sectaries.
      The first fifteen bishops of Jerusalem were all circumcised Jews;
      and the congregation over which they presided united the law of
      Moses with the doctrine of Christ. 17 It was natural that the
      primitive tradition of a church which was founded only forty days
      after the death of Christ, and was governed almost as many years
      under the immediate inspection of his apostle, should be received
      as the standard of orthodoxy. The distant churches very
      frequently appealed to the authority of their venerable Parent,
      and relieved her distresses by a liberal contribution of alms.
      But when numerous and opulent societies were established in the
      great cities of the empire, in Antioch, Alexandria, Ephesus,
      Corinth, and Rome, the reverence which Jerusalem had inspired to
      all the Christian colonies insensibly diminished. 18b The Jewish
      converts, or, as they were afterwards called, the Nazarenes, who
      had laid the foundations of the church, soon found themselves
      overwhelmed by the increasing multitudes, that from all the
      various religions of polytheism enlisted under the banner of
      Christ: and the Gentiles, who, with the approbation of their
      peculiar apostle, had rejected the intolerable weight of the
      Mosaic ceremonies, at length refused to their more scrupulous
      brethren the same toleration which at first they had humbly
      solicited for their own practice. The ruin of the temple of the
      city, and of the public religion of the Jews, was severely felt
      by the Nazarenes; as in their manners, though not in their faith,
      they maintained so intimate a connection with their impious
      countrymen, whose misfortunes were attributed by the Pagans to
      the contempt, and more justly ascribed by the Christians to the
      wrath, of the Supreme Deity. The Nazarenes retired from the ruins
      of Jerusalem 18 to the little town of Pella beyond the Jordan,
      where that ancient church languished above sixty years in
      solitude and obscurity. 19 They still enjoyed the comfort of
      making frequent and devout visits to the _Holy City_, and the
      hope of being one day restored to those seats which both nature
      and religion taught them to love as well as to revere. But at
      length, under the reign of Hadrian, the desperate fanaticism of
      the Jews filled up the measure of their calamities; and the
      Romans, exasperated by their repeated rebellions, exercised the
      rights of victory with unusual rigor. The emperor founded, under
      the name of Ælia Capitolina, a new city on Mount Sion, 20 to
      which he gave the privileges of a colony; and denouncing the
      severest penalties against any of the Jewish people who should
      dare to approach its precincts, he fixed a vigilant garrison of a
      Roman cohort to enforce the execution of his orders. The
      Nazarenes had only one way left to escape the common
      proscription, and the force of truth was on this occasion
      assisted by the influence of temporal advantages. They elected
      Marcus for their bishop, a prelate of the race of the Gentiles,
      and most probably a native either of Italy or of some of the
      Latin provinces. At his persuasion, the most considerable part of
      the congregation renounced the Mosaic law, in the practice of
      which they had persevered above a century. By this sacrifice of
      their habits and prejudices, they purchased a free admission into
      the colony of Hadrian, and more firmly cemented their union with
      the Catholic church. 21

      When the name and honors of the church of Jerusalem had been
      restored to Mount Sion, the crimes of heresy and schism were
      imputed to the obscure remnant of the Nazarenes, which refused to
      accompany their Latin bishop. They still preserved their former
      habitation of Pella, spread themselves into the villages adjacent
      to Damascus, and formed an inconsiderable church in the city of
      Berœa, or, as it is now called, of Aleppo, in Syria. 22 The name
      of Nazarenes was deemed too honorable for those Christian Jews,
      and they soon received, from the supposed poverty of their
      understanding, as well as of their condition, the contemptuous
      epithet of Ebionites. 23 In a few years after the return of the
      church of Jerusalem, it became a matter of doubt and controversy,
      whether a man who sincerely acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah,
      but who still continued to observe the law of Moses, could
      possibly hope for salvation. The humane temper of Justin Martyr
      inclined him to answer this question in the affirmative; and
      though he expressed himself with the most guarded diffidence, he
      ventured to determine in favor of such an imperfect Christian, if
      he were content to practise the Mosaic ceremonies, without
      pretending to assert their general use or necessity. But when
      Justin was pressed to declare the sentiment of the church, he
      confessed that there were very many among the orthodox
      Christians, who not only excluded their Judaizing brethren from
      the hope of salvation, but who declined any intercourse with them
      in the common offices of friendship, hospitality, and social
      life. 24 The more rigorous opinion prevailed, as it was natural
      to expect, over the milder; and an eternal bar of separation was
      fixed between the disciples of Moses and those of Christ. The
      unfortunate Ebionites, rejected from one religion as apostates,
      and from the other as heretics, found themselves compelled to
      assume a more decided character; and although some traces of that
      obsolete sect may be discovered as late as the fourth century,
      they insensibly melted away, either into the church or the
      synagogue. 25

      22 (return) [ Le Clerc (Hist. Ecclesiast. p. 477, 535) seems to
      have collected from Eusebius, Jerome, Epiphanius, and other

      Nazarenes or Ebionites. The nature of their opinions soon divided
      them into a stricter and a milder sect; and there is some reason
      to conjecture, that the family of Jesus Christ remained members,
      at least, of the latter and more moderate party.]

      were not content with observing the Mosaic law themselves, but
      enforced the same observance, as necessary to salvation, upon the
      heathen converts, and refused all social intercourse with them if
      they did not conform to the law. Justin Martyr himself freely
      admits those who kept the law themselves to Christian communion,
      though he acknowledges that some, not the Church, thought
      otherwise; of the other party, he himself thought less favorably.

      Ebionites—G and M.]

      Æthiopians were not converted till the fourth century, it is more
      reasonable to believe that they respected the sabbath, and
      distinguished the forbidden meats, in imitation of the Jews, who,
      in a very early period, were seated on both sides of the Red Sea.

      While the orthodox church preserved a just medium between
      excessive veneration and improper contempt for the law of Moses,
      the various heretics deviated into equal but opposite extremes of
      error and extravagance. From the acknowledged truth of the Jewish
      religion, the Ebionites had concluded that it could never be
      abolished. From its supposed imperfections, the Gnostics as
      hastily inferred that it never was instituted by the wisdom of
      the Deity. There are some objections against the authority of
      Moses and the prophets, which too readily present themselves to
      the sceptical mind; though they can only be derived from our
      ignorance of remote antiquity, and from our incapacity to form an
      adequate judgment of the divine economy. These objections were
      eagerly embraced and as petulantly urged by the vain science of
      the Gnostics. 26 As those heretics were, for the most part,
      averse to the pleasures of sense, they morosely arraigned the
      polygamy of the patriarchs, the gallantries of David, and the
      seraglio of Solomon. The conquest of the land of Canaan, and the
      extirpation of the unsuspecting natives, they were at a loss how
      to reconcile with the common notions of humanity and justice. 261
      But when they recollected the sanguinary list of murders, of
      executions, and of massacres, which stain almost every page of
      the Jewish annals, they acknowledged that the barbarians of
      Palestine had exercised as much compassion towards their
      idolatrous enemies, as they had ever shown to their friends or
      countrymen. 27 Passing from the sectaries of the law to the law
      itself, they asserted that it was impossible that a religion
      which consisted only of bloody sacrifices and trifling
      ceremonies, and whose rewards as well as punishments were all of
      a carnal and temporal nature, could inspire the love of virtue,
      or restrain the impetuosity of passion. The Mosaic account of the
      creation and fall of man was treated with profane derision by the
      Gnostics, who would not listen with patience to the repose of the
      Deity after six days’ labor, to the rib of Adam, the garden of
      Eden, the trees of life and of knowledge, the speaking serpent,
      the forbidden fruit, and the condemnation pronounced against
      human kind for the venial offence of their first progenitors. 28
      The God of Israel was impiously represented by the Gnostics as a
      being liable to passion and to error, capricious in his favor,
      implacable in his resentment, meanly jealous of his superstitious
      worship, and confining his partial providence to a single people,
      and to this transitory life. In such a character they could
      discover none of the features of the wise and omnipotent Father
      of the universe. 29 They allowed that the religion of the Jews
      was somewhat less criminal than the idolatry of the Gentiles; but
      it was their fundamental doctrine that the Christ whom they
      adored as the first and brightest emanation of the Deity appeared
      upon earth to rescue mankind from their various errors, and to
      reveal a new system of truth and perfection. The most learned of
      the fathers, by a very singular condescension, have imprudently
      admitted the sophistry of the Gnostics. 291 Acknowledging that
      the literal sense is repugnant to every principle of faith as
      well as reason, they deem themselves secure and invulnerable
      behind the ample veil of allegory, which they carefully spread
      over every tender part of the Mosaic dispensation. 30

      of Josephus with the Roman authorities, must be kept in mind

      the ferocity and fanaticism of the Jews at that time; but

      It has been remarked with more ingenuity than truth, that the
      virgin purity of the church was never violated by schism or
      heresy before the reign of Trajan or Hadrian, about one hundred
      years after the death of Christ. 31 We may observe with much more
      propriety, that, during that period, the disciples of the Messiah
      were indulged in a freer latitude, both of faith and practice,
      than has ever been allowed in succeeding ages. As the terms of
      communion were insensibly narrowed, and the spiritual authority
      of the prevailing party was exercised with increasing severity,
      many of its most respectable adherents, who were called upon to
      renounce, were provoked to assert their private opinions, to
      pursue the consequences of their mistaken principles, and openly
      to erect the standard of rebellion against the unity of the
      church. The Gnostics were distinguished as the most polite, the
      most learned, and the most wealthy of the Christian name; and
      that general appellation, which expressed a superiority of
      knowledge, was either assumed by their own pride, or ironically
      bestowed by the envy of their adversaries. They were almost
      without exception of the race of the Gentiles, and their
      principal founders seem to have been natives of Syria or Egypt,
      where the warmth of the climate disposes both the mind and the
      body to indolent and contemplative devotion. The Gnostics blended
      with the faith of Christ many sublime but obscure tenets, which
      they derived from oriental philosophy, and even from the religion
      of Zoroaster, concerning the eternity of matter, the existence of
      two principles, and the mysterious hierarchy of the invisible
      world. 32 As soon as they launched out into that vast abyss, they
      delivered themselves to the guidance of a disordered imagination;
      and as the paths of error are various and infinite, the Gnostics
      were imperceptibly divided into more than fifty particular sects,
      33 of whom the most celebrated appear to have been the
      Basilidians, the Valentinians, the Marcionites, and, in a still
      later period, the Manichæans. Each of these sects could boast of
      its bishops and congregations, of its doctors and martyrs; 34
      and, instead of the Four Gospels adopted by the church, 341 the
      heretics produced a multitude of histories, in which the actions
      and discourses of Christ and of his apostles were adapted to
      their respective tenets. 35 The success of the Gnostics was rapid
      and extensive. 36 They covered Asia and Egypt, established
      themselves in Rome, and sometimes penetrated into the provinces
      of the West. For the most part they arose in the second century,
      flourished during the third, and were suppressed in the fourth or
      fifth, by the prevalence of more fashionable controversies, and
      by the superior ascendant of the reigning power. Though they
      constantly disturbed the peace, and frequently disgraced the
      name, of religion, they contributed to assist rather than to
      retard the progress of Christianity. The Gentile converts, whose
      strongest objections and prejudices were directed against the law
      of Moses, could find admission into many Christian societies,
      which required not from their untutored mind any belief of an
      antecedent revelation. Their faith was insensibly fortified and
      enlarged, and the church was ultimately benefited by the
      conquests of its most inveterate enemies. 37

      (particularly in the resurrection of Christ) are directly, and as

      But whatever difference of opinion might subsist between the
      Orthodox, the Ebionites, and the Gnostics, concerning the
      divinity or the obligation of the Mosaic law, they were all
      equally animated by the same exclusive zeal, and by the same
      abhorrence for idolatry, which had distinguished the Jews from
      the other nations of the ancient world. The philosopher, who
      considered the system of polytheism as a composition of human
      fraud and error, could disguise a smile of contempt under the
      mask of devotion, without apprehending that either the mockery,
      or the compliance, would expose him to the resentment of any
      invisible, or, as he conceived them, imaginary powers. But the
      established religions of Paganism were seen by the primitive
      Christians in a much more odious and formidable light. It was the
      universal sentiment both of the church and of heretics, that the
      dæmons were the authors, the patrons, and the objects of
      idolatry. 38 Those rebellious spirits who had been degraded from
      the rank of angels, and cast down into the infernal pit, were
      still permitted to roam upon earth, to torment the bodies, and to
      seduce the minds, of sinful men. The dæmons soon discovered and
      abused the natural propensity of the human heart towards
      devotion, and artfully withdrawing the adoration of mankind from
      their Creator, they usurped the place and honors of the Supreme
      Deity. By the success of their malicious contrivances, they at
      once gratified their own vanity and revenge, and obtained the
      only comfort of which they were yet susceptible, the hope of
      involving the human species in the participation of their guilt
      and misery. It was confessed, or at least it was imagined, that
      they had distributed among themselves the most important
      characters of polytheism, one dæmon assuming the name and
      attributes of Jupiter, another of Æsculapius, a third of Venus,
      and a fourth perhaps of Apollo; 39 and that, by the advantage of
      their long experience and ærial nature, they were enabled to
      execute, with sufficient skill and dignity, the parts which they
      had undertaken. They lurked in the temples, instituted festivals
      and sacrifices, invented fables, pronounced oracles, and were
      frequently allowed to perform miracles. The Christians, who, by
      the interposition of evil spirits, could so readily explain every
      præternatural appearance, were disposed and even desirous to
      admit the most extravagant fictions of the Pagan mythology. But
      the belief of the Christian was accompanied with horror. The most
      trifling mark of respect to the national worship he considered as
      a direct homage yielded to the dæmon, and as an act of rebellion
      against the majesty of God.

      Chapter XV: Progress Of The Christian Religion.—Part III.

      In consequence of this opinion, it was the first but arduous duty
      of a Christian to preserve himself pure and undefiled by the
      practice of idolatry. The religion of the nations was not merely
      a speculative doctrine professed in the schools or preached in
      the temples. The innumerable deities and rites of polytheism were
      closely interwoven with every circumstance of business or
      pleasure, of public or of private life, and it seemed impossible
      to escape the observance of them, without, at the same time,
      renouncing the commerce of mankind, and all the offices and
      amusements of society. 40 The important transactions of peace and
      war were prepared or concluded by solemn sacrifices, in which the
      magistrate, the senator, and the soldier, were obliged to preside
      or to participate. 41 The public spectacles were an essential
      part of the cheerful devotion of the Pagans, and the gods were
      supposed to accept, as the most grateful offering, the games that
      the prince and people celebrated in honor of their peculiar
      festivals. 42 The Christians, who with pious horror avoided the
      abomination of the circus or the theatre, found himself
      encompassed with infernal snares in every convivial
      entertainment, as often as his friends, invoking the hospitable
      deities, poured out libations to each other’s happiness. 43 When
      the bride, struggling with well-affected reluctance, was forced
      in hymenæal pomp over the threshold of her new habitation, 44 or
      when the sad procession of the dead slowly moved towards the
      funeral pile, 45 the Christian, on these interesting occasions,
      was compelled to desert the persons who were the dearest to him,
      rather than contract the guilt inherent to those impious
      ceremonies. Every art and every trade that was in the least
      concerned in the framing or adorning of idols was polluted by the
      stain of idolatry; 46 a severe sentence, since it devoted to
      eternal misery the far greater part of the community, which is
      employed in the exercise of liberal or mechanic professions. If
      we cast our eyes over the numerous remains of antiquity, we shall
      perceive, that besides the immediate representations of the gods,
      and the holy instruments of their worship, the elegant forms and
      agreeable fictions consecrated by the imagination of the Greeks,
      were introduced as the richest ornaments of the houses, the
      dress, and the furniture of the Pagans. 47 Even the arts of music
      and painting, of eloquence and poetry, flowed from the same
      impure origin. In the style of the fathers, Apollo and the Muses
      were the organs of the infernal spirit; Homer and Virgil were the
      most eminent of his servants; and the beautiful mythology which
      pervades and animates the compositions of their genius, is
      destined to celebrate the glory of the dæmons. Even the common
      language of Greece and Rome abounded with familiar but impious
      expressions, which the imprudent Christian might too carelessly
      utter, or too patiently hear. 48

      The dangerous temptations which on every side lurked in ambush to
      surprise the unguarded believer, assailed him with redoubled
      violence on the days of solemn festivals. So artfully were they
      framed and disposed throughout the year, that superstition always
      wore the appearance of pleasure, and often of virtue. Some of the
      most sacred festivals in the Roman ritual were destined to salute
      the new calends of January with vows of public and private
      felicity; to indulge the pious remembrance of the dead and
      living; to ascertain the inviolable bounds of property; to hail,
      on the return of spring, the genial powers of fecundity; to
      perpetuate the two memorable æras of Rome, the foundation of the
      city and that of the republic; and to restore, during the humane
      license of the Saturnalia, the primitive equality of mankind.
      Some idea may be conceived of the abhorrence of the Christians
      for such impious ceremonies, by the scrupulous delicacy which
      they displayed on a much less alarming occasion. On days of
      general festivity it was the custom of the ancients to adorn
      their doors with lamps and with branches of laurel, and to crown
      their heads with a garland of flowers. This innocent and elegant
      practice might perhaps have been tolerated as a mere civil
      institution. But it most unluckily happened that the doors were
      under the protection of the household gods, that the laurel was
      sacred to the lover of Daphne, and that garlands of flowers,
      though frequently worn as a symbol either of joy or mourning, had
      been dedicated in their first origin to the service of
      superstition. The trembling Christians, who were persuaded in
      this instance to comply with the fashion of their country, and
      the commands of the magistrate, labored under the most gloomy
      apprehensions, from the reproaches of his own conscience, the
      censures of the church, and the denunciations of divine
      vengeance. 49 50

      relation to the title.]

      50 (return) [ Tertullian has composed a defence, or rather
      panegyric, of the rash action of a Christian soldier, who, by
      throwing away his crown of laurel, had exposed himself and his
      brethren to the most imminent danger. By the mention of the
      emperors, (Severus and Caracalla,) it is evident, notwithstanding
      the wishes of M. de Tillemont, that Tertullian composed his
      treatise De Corona long before he was engaged in the errors of
      the Montanists. See Memoires Ecclesiastiques, tom. iii. p. 384.
      Note: The soldier did not tear off his crown to throw it down
      with contempt; he did not even throw it away; he held it in his
      hand, while others were it on their heads. Solus libero capite,
      ornamento in manu otioso.—G Note: Tertullian does not expressly
      name the two emperors, Severus and Caracalla: he speaks only of
      two emperors, and of a long peace which the church had enjoyed.
      It is generally agreed that Tertullian became a Montanist about
      the year 200: his work, de Corona Militis, appears to have been
      written, at the earliest about the year 202 before the
      persecution of Severus: it may be maintained, then, that it is
      subsequent to the Montanism of the author. See Mosheim, Diss. de
      Apol. Tertull. p. 53. Biblioth. Amsterd. tom. x. part ii. p. 292.

      opinions at the particular period is almost an idle question.

      representative of Christianity.—M.]

      Such was the anxious diligence which was required to guard the
      chastity of the gospel from the infectious breath of idolatry.
      The superstitious observances of public or private rites were
      carelessly practised, from education and habit, by the followers
      of the established religion. But as often as they occurred, they
      afforded the Christians an opportunity of declaring and
      confirming their zealous opposition. By these frequent
      protestations their attachment to the faith was continually
      fortified; and in proportion to the increase of zeal, they
      combated with the more ardor and success in the holy war, which
      they had undertaken against the empire of the demons.

      II. The writings of Cicero 51 represent in the most lively colors
      the ignorance, the errors, and the uncertainty of the ancient
      philosophers with regard to the immortality of the soul. When
      they are desirous of arming their disciples against the fear of
      death, they inculcate, as an obvious though melancholy position,
      that the fatal stroke of our dissolution releases us from the
      calamities of life; and that those can no longer suffer, who no
      longer exist. Yet there were a few sages of Greece and Rome who
      had conceived a more exalted, and, in some respects, a juster
      idea of human nature, though it must be confessed, that in the
      sublime inquiry, their reason had been often guided by their
      imagination, and that their imagination had been prompted by
      their vanity. When they viewed with complacency the extent of
      their own mental powers, when they exercised the various
      faculties of memory, of fancy, and of judgment, in the most
      profound speculations, or the most important labors, and when
      they reflected on the desire of fame, which transported them into
      future ages, far beyond the bounds of death and of the grave,
      they were unwilling to confound themselves with the beasts of the
      field, or to suppose that a being, for whose dignity they
      entertained the most sincere admiration, could be limited to a
      spot of earth, and to a few years of duration. With this
      favorable prepossession they summoned to their aid the science,
      or rather the language, of Metaphysics. They soon discovered,
      that as none of the properties of matter will apply to the
      operations of the mind, the human soul must consequently be a
      substance distinct from the body, pure, simple, and spiritual,
      incapable of dissolution, and susceptible of a much higher degree
      of virtue and happiness after the release from its corporeal
      prison. From these specious and noble principles, the
      philosophers who trod in the footsteps of Plato deduced a very
      unjustifiable conclusion, since they asserted, not only the
      future immortality, but the past eternity, of the human soul,
      which they were too apt to consider as a portion of the infinite
      and self-existing spirit, which pervades and sustains the
      universe. 52 A doctrine thus removed beyond the senses and the
      experience of mankind might serve to amuse the leisure of a
      philosophic mind; or, in the silence of solitude, it might
      sometimes impart a ray of comfort to desponding virtue; but the
      faint impression which had been received in the schools was soon
      obliterated by the commerce and business of active life. We are
      sufficiently acquainted with the eminent persons who flourished
      in the age of Cicero and of the first Cæsars, with their actions,
      their characters, and their motives, to be assured that their
      conduct in this life was never regulated by any serious
      conviction of the rewards or punishments of a future state. At
      the bar and in the senate of Rome the ablest orators were not
      apprehensive of giving offence to their hearers by exposing that
      doctrine as an idle and extravagant opinion, which was rejected
      with contempt by every man of a liberal education and
      understanding. 53

      51 (return) [ In particular, the first book of the Tusculan
      Questions, and the treatise De Senectute, and the Somnium
      Scipionis, contain, in the most beautiful language, every thing
      that Grecian philosophy, on Roman good sense, could possibly
      suggest on this dark but important object.]

      52 (return) [ The preexistence of human souls, so far at least as
      that doctrine is compatible with religion, was adopted by many of
      the Greek and Latin fathers. See Beausobre, Hist. du Manicheisme,
      l. vi. c. 4.]

      53 (return) [ See Cicero pro Cluent. c. 61. Cæsar ap. Sallust. de

      manes, et subterranea regna, —————Nec pueri credunt, nisi qui
      nondum æree lavantæ.]

      Since therefore the most sublime efforts of philosophy can extend
      no further than feebly to point out the desire, the hope, or, at
      most, the probability, of a future state, there is nothing,
      except a divine revelation, that can ascertain the existence and
      describe the condition, of the invisible country which is
      destined to receive the souls of men after their separation from
      the body. But we may perceive several defects inherent to the
      popular religions of Greece and Rome, which rendered them very
      unequal to so arduous a task. 1. The general system of their
      mythology was unsupported by any solid proofs; and the wisest
      among the Pagans had already disclaimed its usurped authority. 2.
      The description of the infernal regions had been abandoned to the
      fancy of painters and of poets, who peopled them with so many
      phantoms and monsters, who dispensed their rewards and
      punishments with so little equity, that a solemn truth, the most
      congenial to the human heart, was oppressed and disgraced by the
      absurd mixture of the wildest fictions. 54 3. The doctrine of a
      future state was scarcely considered among the devout polytheists
      of Greece and Rome as a fundamental article of faith. The
      providence of the gods, as it related to public communities
      rather than to private individuals, was principally displayed on
      the visible theatre of the present world. The petitions which
      were offered on the altars of Jupiter or Apollo expressed the
      anxiety of their worshippers for temporal happiness, and their
      ignorance or indifference concerning a future life. 55 The
      important truth of the immortality of the soul was inculcated
      with more diligence, as well as success, in India, in Assyria, in
      Egypt, and in Gaul; and since we cannot attribute such a
      difference to the superior knowledge of the barbarians, we must
      ascribe it to the influence of an established priesthood, which
      employed the motives of virtue as the instrument of ambition. 56

      54 (return) [ The xith book of the Odyssey gives a very dreary
      and incoherent account of the infernal shades. Pindar and Virgil
      have embellished the picture; but even those poets, though more
      correct than their great model, are guilty of very strange
      inconsistencies. See Bayle, Responses aux Questions d’un
      Provincial, part iii. c. 22.]

      55 (return) [ See xvith epistle of the first book of Horace, the

      multitude.]

      56 (return) [ If we confine ourselves to the Gauls, we may
      observe, that they intrusted, not only their lives, but even
      their money, to the security of another world. Vetus ille mos
      Gallorum occurrit (says Valerius Maximus, l. ii. c. 6, p. 10)
      quos, memoria proditum est pecunias montuas, quæ his apud inferos
      redderentur, dare solitos. The same custom is more darkly
      insinuated by Mela, l. iii. c. 2. It is almost needless to add,
      that the profits of trade hold a just proportion to the credit of
      the merchant, and that the Druids derived from their holy
      profession a character of responsibility, which could scarcely be
      claimed by any other order of men.]

      We might naturally expect that a principle so essential to
      religion, would have been revealed in the clearest terms to the
      chosen people of Palestine, and that it might safely have been
      intrusted to the hereditary priesthood of Aaron. It is incumbent
      on us to adore the mysterious dispensations of Providence, 57
      when we discover that the doctrine of the immortality of the soul
      is omitted in the law of Moses; it is darkly insinuated by the
      prophets; and during the long period which elapsed between the
      Egyptian and the Babylonian servitudes, the hopes as well as
      fears of the Jews appear to have been confined within the narrow
      compass of the present life. 58 After Cyrus had permitted the
      exiled nation to return into the promised land, and after Ezra
      had restored the ancient records of their religion, two
      celebrated sects, the Sadducees and the Pharisees, insensibly
      arose at Jerusalem. 59 The former, selected from the more opulent
      and distinguished ranks of society, were strictly attached to the
      literal sense of the Mosaic law, and they piously rejected the
      immortality of the soul, as an opinion that received no
      countenance from the divine book, which they revered as the only
      rule of their faith. To the authority of Scripture the Pharisees
      added that of tradition, and they accepted, under the name of
      traditions, several speculative tenets from the philosophy or
      religion of the eastern nations. The doctrines of fate or
      predestination, of angels and spirits, and of a future state of
      rewards and punishments, were in the number of these new articles
      of belief; and as the Pharisees, by the austerity of their
      manners, had drawn into their party the body of the Jewish
      people, the immortality of the soul became the prevailing
      sentiment of the synagogue, under the reign of the Asmonæan
      princes and pontiffs. The temper of the Jews was incapable of
      contenting itself with such a cold and languid assent as might
      satisfy the mind of a Polytheist; and as soon as they admitted
      the idea of a future state, they embraced it with the zeal which
      has always formed the characteristic of the nation. Their zeal,
      however, added nothing to its evidence, or even probability: and
      it was still necessary that the doctrine of life and immortality,
      which had been dictated by nature, approved by reason, and
      received by superstition, should obtain the sanction of divine
      truth from the authority and example of Christ.

      ingeniously retorts it on the unbelievers. * Note: The hypothesis
      of Warburton concerning this remarkable fact, which, as far as
      the Law of Moses, is unquestionable, made few disciples; and it
      is difficult to suppose that it could be intended by the author
      himself for more than a display of intellectual strength. Modern
      writers have accounted in various ways for the silence of the
      Hebrew legislator on the immortality of the soul. According to
      Michaelis, “Moses wrote as an historian and as a lawgiver; he
      regulated the ecclesiastical discipline, rather than the
      religious belief of his people; and the sanctions of the law
      being temporal, he had no occasion, and as a civil legislator
      could not with propriety, threaten punishments in another world.”

      Trans.; and Syntagma Commentationum, p. 80, quoted by Guizot. M.
      Guizot adds, the “ingenious conjecture of a philosophic
      theologian,” which approximates to an opinion long entertained by
      the Editor. That writer believes, that in the state of
      civilization at the time of the legislator, this doctrine, become
      popular among the Jews, would necessarily have given birth to a
      multitude of idolatrous superstitions which he wished to prevent.
      His primary object was to establish a firm theocracy, to make his
      people the conservators of the doctrine of the Divine Unity, the
      basis upon which Christianity was hereafter to rest. He carefully
      excluded everything which could obscure or weaken that doctrine.
      Other nations had strangely abused their notions on the
      immortality of the soul; Moses wished to prevent this abuse:
      hence he forbade the Jews from consulting necromancers, (those
      who evoke the spirits of the dead.) Deut. xviii. 11. Those who
      reflect on the state of the Pagans and the Jews, and on the
      facility with which idolatry crept in on every side, will not be
      astonished that Moses has not developed a doctrine of which the
      influence might be more pernicious than useful to his people.

      of Job though this opinion is in general rejected; other learned
      writers consider this Book to be coeval with and known to Moses,)
      as from his long residence in Egypt, and his acquaintance with
      Egyptian wisdom, could not be ignorant of the doctrine of the
      immortality of the soul. But this doctrine if popularly known
      among the Jews, must have been purely Egyptian, and as so,
      intimately connected with the whole religious system of that
      country. It was no doubt moulded up with the tenet of the
      transmigration of the soul, perhaps with notions analogous to the
      emanation system of India in which the human soul was an efflux
      from or indeed a part of, the Deity. The Mosaic religion drew a
      wide and impassable interval between the Creator and created
      human beings: in this it differed from the Egyptian and all the
      Eastern religions. As then the immortality of the soul was thus
      inseparably blended with those foreign religions which were
      altogether to be effaced from the minds of the people, and by no
      means necessary for the establishment of the theocracy, Moses
      maintained silence on this point and a purer notion of it was
      left to be developed at a more favorable period in the history of

      When the promise of eternal happiness was proposed to mankind on
      condition of adopting the faith, and of observing the precepts,
      of the gospel, it is no wonder that so advantageous an offer
      should have been accepted by great numbers of every religion, of
      every rank, and of every province in the Roman empire. The
      ancient Christians were animated by a contempt for their present
      existence, and by a just confidence of immortality, of which the
      doubtful and imperfect faith of modern ages cannot give us any
      adequate notion. In the primitive church, the influence of truth
      was very powerfully strengthened by an opinion, which, however it
      may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity, has not
      been found agreeable to experience. It was universally believed,
      that the end of the world, and the kingdom of heaven, were at
      hand. 591 The near approach of this wonderful event had been
      predicted by the apostles; the tradition of it was preserved by
      their earliest disciples, and those who understood in their
      literal senses the discourse of Christ himself, were obliged to
      expect the second and glorious coming of the Son of Man in the
      clouds, before that generation was totally extinguished, which
      had beheld his humble condition upon earth, and which might still
      be witness of the calamities of the Jews under Vespasian or
      Hadrian. The revolution of seventeen centuries has instructed us
      not to press too closely the mysterious language of prophecy and
      revelation; but as long as, for wise purposes, this error was
      permitted to subsist in the church, it was productive of the most
      salutary effects on the faith and practice of Christians, who
      lived in the awful expectation of that moment, when the globe
      itself, and all the various race of mankind, should tremble at
      the appearance of their divine Judge. 60

      60 (return) [ This expectation was countenanced by the
      twenty-fourth chapter of St. Matthew, and by the first epistle of

      the help of allegory and metaphor; and the learned Grotius
      ventures to insinuate, that, for wise purposes, the pious
      deception was permitted to take place. * Note: Some modern
      theologians explain it without discovering either allegory or
      deception. They say, that Jesus Christ, after having proclaimed
      the ruin of Jerusalem and of the Temple, speaks of his second
      coming and the sings which were to precede it; but those who
      believed that the moment was near deceived themselves as to the
      sense of two words, an error which still subsists in our versions
      of the Gospel according to St. Matthew, xxiv. 29, 34. In verse
      29, we read, “Immediately after the tribulation of those days
      shall the sun be darkened,” &c. The Greek word signifies all at
      once, suddenly, not immediately; so that it signifies only the
      sudden appearance of the signs which Jesus Christ announces not
      the shortness of the interval which was to separate them from the
      “days of tribulation,” of which he was speaking. The verse 34 is
      this “Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass till
      all these things shall be fulfilled.” Jesus, speaking to his
      disciples, uses these words, which the translators have rendered
      by this generation, but which means the race, the filiation of my
      disciples; that is, he speaks of a class of men, not of a
      generation. The true sense then, according to these learned men,
      is, In truth I tell you that this race of men, of which you are
      the commencement, shall not pass away till this shall take place;
      that is to say, the succession of Christians shall not cease till
      his coming. See Commentary of M. Paulus on the New Test., edit.

      Chapter XV: Progress Of The Christian Religion.—Part IV.

      The ancient and popular doctrine of the Millennium was intimately
      connected with the second coming of Christ. As the works of the
      creation had been finished in six days, their duration in their
      present state, according to a tradition which was attributed to
      the prophet Elijah, was fixed to six thousand years. 61 By the
      same analogy it was inferred, that this long period of labor and
      contention, which was now almost elapsed, 62 would be succeeded
      by a joyful Sabbath of a thousand years; and that Christ, with
      the triumphant band of the saints and the elect who had escaped
      death, or who had been miraculously revived, would reign upon
      earth till the time appointed for the last and general
      resurrection. So pleasing was this hope to the mind of believers,
      that the _New Jerusalem_, the seat of this blissful kingdom, was
      quickly adorned with all the gayest colors of the imagination. A
      felicity consisting only of pure and spiritual pleasure would
      have appeared too refined for its inhabitants, who were still
      supposed to possess their human nature and senses. A garden of
      Eden, with the amusements of the pastoral life, was no longer
      suited to the advanced state of society which prevailed under the
      Roman empire. A city was therefore erected of gold and precious
      stones, and a supernatural plenty of corn and wine was bestowed
      on the adjacent territory; in the free enjoyment of whose
      spontaneous productions the happy and benevolent people was never
      to be restrained by any jealous laws of exclusive property. 63
      The assurance of such a Millennium was carefully inculcated by a
      succession of fathers from Justin Martyr, 64 and Irenæus, who
      conversed with the immediate disciples of the apostles, down to
      Lactantius, who was preceptor to the son of Constantine. 65
      Though it might not be universally received, it appears to have
      been the reigning sentiment of the orthodox believers; and it
      seems so well adapted to the desires and apprehensions of
      mankind, that it must have contributed in a very considerable
      degree to the progress of the Christian faith. But when the
      edifice of the church was almost completed, the temporary support
      was laid aside. The doctrine of Christ’s reign upon earth was at
      first treated as a profound allegory, was considered by degrees
      as a doubtful and useless opinion, and was at length rejected as
      the absurd invention of heresy and fanaticism. 66 A mysterious
      prophecy, which still forms a part of the sacred canon, but which
      was thought to favor the exploded sentiment, has very narrowly
      escaped the proscription of the church. 67

      6000 years from the creation of the world to the birth of Christ.
      Africanus, Lactantius, and the Greek church, have reduced that
      number to 5500, and Eusebius has contented himself with 5200
      years. These calculations were formed on the Septuagint, which
      was universally received during the six first centuries. The
      authority of the vulgate and of the Hebrew text has determined
      the moderns, Protestants as well as Catholics, to prefer a period
      of about 4000 years; though, in the study of profane antiquity,
      they often find themselves straitened by those narrow limits. *
      Note: Most of the more learned modern English Protestants, Dr.
      Hales, Mr. Faber, Dr. Russel, as well as the Continental writers,
      adopt the larger chronology. There is little doubt that the
      narrower system was framed by the Jews of Tiberias; it was
      clearly neither that of St. Paul, nor of Josephus, nor of the
      Samaritan Text. It is greatly to be regretted that the chronology
      of the earlier Scriptures should ever have been made a religious
      question—M.]

      traditions, in Lightfoot, Schoetgen, and Eisenmenger; “Das

      67 (return) [ In the council of Laodicea, (about the year 360,)
      the Apocalypse was tacitly excluded from the sacred canon, by the
      same churches of Asia to which it is addressed; and we may learn
      from the complaint of Sulpicius Severus, that their sentence had
      been ratified by the greater number of Christians of his time.
      From what causes then is the Apocalypse at present so generally
      received by the Greek, the Roman, and the Protestant churches?
      The following ones may be assigned. 1. The Greeks were subdued by
      the authority of an impostor, who, in the sixth century, assumed
      the character of Dionysius the Areopagite. 2. A just apprehension
      that the grammarians might become more important than the
      theologians, engaged the council of Trent to fix the seal of
      their infallibility on all the books of Scripture contained in
      the Latin Vulgate, in the number of which the Apocalypse was
      fortunately included. (Fr. Paolo, Istoria del Concilio
      Tridentino, l. ii.) 3. The advantage of turning those mysterious
      prophecies against the See of Rome, inspired the Protestants with
      uncommon veneration for so useful an ally. See the ingenious and
      elegant discourses of the present bishop of Litchfield on that
      unpromising subject. * Note: The exclusion of the Apocalypse is
      not improbably assigned to its obvious unfitness to be read in
      churches. It is to be feared that a history of the interpretation
      of the Apocalypse would not give a very favorable view either of
      the wisdom or the charity of the successive ages of Christianity.
      Wetstein’s interpretation, differently modified, is adopted by
      most Continental scholars.—M.]

      Whilst the happiness and glory of a temporal reign were promised
      to the disciples of Christ, the most dreadful calamities were
      denounced against an unbelieving world. The edification of a new
      Jerusalem was to advance by equal steps with the destruction of
      the mystic Babylon; and as long as the emperors who reigned
      before Constantine persisted in the profession of idolatry, the
      epithet of Babylon was applied to the city and to the empire of
      Rome. A regular series was prepared of all the moral and physical
      evils which can afflict a flourishing nation; intestine discord,
      and the invasion of the fiercest barbarians from the unknown
      regions of the North; pestilence and famine, comets and eclipses,
      earthquakes and inundations. 68 All these were only so many
      preparatory and alarming signs of the great catastrophe of Rome,
      when the country of the Scipios and Cæsars should be consumed by
      a flame from Heaven, and the city of the seven hills, with her
      palaces, her temples, and her triumphal arches, should be buried
      in a vast lake of fire and brimstone. It might, however, afford
      some consolation to Roman vanity, that the period of their empire
      would be that of the world itself; which, as it had once perished
      by the element of water, was destined to experience a second and
      a speedy destruction from the element of fire. In the opinion of
      a general conflagration, the faith of the Christian very happily
      coincided with the tradition of the East, the philosophy of the
      Stoics, and the analogy of Nature; and even the country, which,
      from religious motives, had been chosen for the origin and
      principal scene of the conflagration, was the best adapted for
      that purpose by natural and physical causes; by its deep caverns,
      beds of sulphur, and numerous volcanoes, of which those of Ætna,
      of Vesuvius, and of Lipari, exhibit a very imperfect
      representation. The calmest and most intrepid sceptic could not
      refuse to acknowledge that the destruction of the present system
      of the world by fire was in itself extremely probable. The
      Christian, who founded his belief much less on the fallacious
      arguments of reason than on the authority of tradition and the
      interpretation of Scripture, expected it with terror and
      confidence as a certain and approaching event; and as his mind
      was perpetually filled with the solemn idea, he considered every
      disaster that happened to the empire as an infallible symptom of
      an expiring world. 69

      fancy not inferior to that of Milton himself.]

      The condemnation of the wisest and most virtuous of the Pagans,
      on account of their ignorance or disbelief of the divine truth,
      seems to offend the reason and the humanity of the present age.
      70 But the primitive church, whose faith was of a much firmer
      consistence, delivered over, without hesitation, to eternal
      torture, the far greater part of the human species. A charitable
      hope might perhaps be indulged in favor of Socrates, or some
      other sages of antiquity, who had consulted the light of reason
      before that of the gospel had arisen. 71 But it was unanimously
      affirmed, that those who, since the birth or the death of Christ,
      had obstinately persisted in the worship of the dæmons, neither
      deserved nor could expect a pardon from the irritated justice of
      the Deity. These rigid sentiments, which had been unknown to the
      ancient world, appear to have infused a spirit of bitterness into
      a system of love and harmony. The ties of blood and friendship
      were frequently torn asunder by the difference of religious
      faith; and the Christians, who, in this world, found themselves
      oppressed by the power of the Pagans, were sometimes seduced by
      resentment and spiritual pride to delight in the prospect of
      their future triumph. “You are fond of spectacles,” exclaims the
      stern Tertullian; “expect the greatest of all spectacles, the
      last and eternal judgment of the universe. 71b How shall I
      admire, how laugh, how rejoice, how exult, when I behold so many
      proud monarchs, so many fancied gods, groaning in the lowest
      abyss of darkness; so many magistrates, who persecuted the name
      of the Lord, liquefying in fiercer fires than they ever kindled
      against the Christians; so many sage philosophers blushing in
      red-hot flames with their deluded scholars; so many celebrated
      poets trembling before the tribunal, not of Minos, but of Christ;
      so many tragedians, more tuneful in the expression of their own
      sufferings; so many dancers.”

      711 But the humanity of the reader will permit me to draw a veil

      prevailed over the violence of human passions: Qui ergo putaveris
      nihil nos de salute Cæsaris curare (he says in his Apology)
      inspice Dei voces, literas nostras. Scitote ex illis præceptum
      esse nobis ad redudantionem, benignitates etiam pro inimicis Deum
      orare, et pro persecutoribus cona precari. Sed etiam nominatim
      atque manifeste orate inquit (Christus) pro regibus et pro
      principibus et potestatibus ut omnia sint tranquilla vobis Tert.
      Apol. c. 31.—G. ——It would be wiser for Christianity, retreating
      upon its genuine records in the New Testament, to disclaim this
      fierce African, than to identify itself with his furious
      invectives by unsatisfactory apologies for their unchristian
      fanaticism.—M.]

      Doubtless there were many among the primitive Christians of a
      temper more suitable to the meekness and charity of their
      profession. There were many who felt a sincere compassion for the
      danger of their friends and countrymen, and who exerted the most
      benevolent zeal to save them from the impending destruction.

      The careless Polytheist, assailed by new and unexpected terrors,
      against which neither his priests nor his philosophers could
      afford him any certain protection, was very frequently terrified
      and subdued by the menace of eternal tortures. His fears might
      assist the progress of his faith and reason; and if he could once
      persuade himself to suspect that the Christian religion might
      possibly be true, it became an easy task to convince him that it
      was the safest and most prudent party that he could possibly
      embrace.

      III. The supernatural gifts, which even in this life were
      ascribed to the Christians above the rest of mankind, must have
      conduced to their own comfort, and very frequently to the
      conviction of infidels. Besides the occasional prodigies, which
      might sometimes be effected by the immediate interposition of the
      Deity when he suspended the laws of Nature for the service of
      religion, the Christian church, from the time of the apostles and
      their first disciples, 73 has claimed an uninterrupted succession
      of miraculous powers, the gift of tongues, of vision, and of
      prophecy, the power of expelling dæmons, of healing the sick, and
      of raising the dead. The knowledge of foreign languages was
      frequently communicated to the contemporaries of Irenæus, though
      Irenæus himself was left to struggle with the difficulties of a
      barbarous dialect, whilst he preached the gospel to the natives
      of Gaul. 74 The divine inspiration, whether it was conveyed in
      the form of a waking or of a sleeping vision, is described as a
      favor very liberally bestowed on all ranks of the faithful, on
      women as on elders, on boys as well as upon bishops. When their
      devout minds were sufficiently prepared by a course of prayer, of
      fasting, and of vigils, to receive the extraordinary impulse,
      they were transported out of their senses, and delivered in
      ecstasy what was inspired, being mere organs of the Holy Spirit,
      just as a pipe or flute is of him who blows into it. 75 We may
      add, that the design of these visions was, for the most part,
      either to disclose the future history, or to guide the present
      administration, of the church. The expulsion of the dæmons from
      the bodies of those unhappy persons whom they had been permitted
      to torment, was considered as a signal though ordinary triumph of
      religion, and is repeatedly alleged by the ancient apoligists, as
      the most convincing evidence of the truth of Christianity. The
      awful ceremony was usually performed in a public manner, and in
      the presence of a great number of spectators; the patient was
      relieved by the power or skill of the exorcist, and the
      vanquished dæmon was heard to confess that he was one of the
      fabled gods of antiquity, who had impiously usurped the adoration
      of mankind. 76 But the miraculous cure of diseases of the most
      inveterate or even preternatural kind can no longer occasion any
      surprise, when we recollect, that in the days of Irenæus, about
      the end of the second century, the resurrection of the dead was
      very far from being esteemed an uncommon event; that the miracle
      was frequently performed on necessary occasions, by great fasting
      and the joint supplication of the church of the place, and that
      the persons thus restored to their prayers had lived afterwards
      among them many years. 77 At such a period, when faith could
      boast of so many wonderful victories over death, it seems
      difficult to account for the scepticism of those philosophers,
      who still rejected and derided the doctrine of the resurrection.
      A noble Grecian had rested on this important ground the whole
      controversy, and promised Theophilus, Bishop of Antioch, that if
      he could be gratified with the sight of a single person who had
      been actually raised from the dead, he would immediately embrace
      the Christian religion. It is somewhat remarkable, that the
      prelate of the first eastern church, however anxious for the
      conversion of his friend, thought proper to decline this fair and
      reasonable challenge. 78

      The miracles of the primitive church, after obtaining the
      sanction of ages, have been lately attacked in a very free and
      ingenious inquiry, 79 which, though it has met with the most
      favorable reception from the public, appears to have excited a
      general scandal among the divines of our own as well as of the
      other Protestant churches of Europe. 80 Our different sentiments
      on this subject will be much less influenced by any particular
      arguments, than by our habits of study and reflection; and, above
      all, by the degree of evidence which we have accustomed ourselves
      to require for the proof of a miraculous event. The duty of an
      historian does not call upon him to interpose his private
      judgment in this nice and important controversy; but he ought not
      to dissemble the difficulty of adopting such a theory as may
      reconcile the interest of religion with that of reason, of making
      a proper application of that theory, and of defining with
      precision the limits of that happy period, exempt from error and
      from deceit, to which we might be disposed to extend the gift of
      supernatural powers. From the first of the fathers to the last of
      the popes, a succession of bishops, of saints, of martyrs, and of
      miracles, is continued without interruption; and the progress of
      superstition was so gradual, and almost imperceptible, that we
      know not in what particular link we should break the chain of
      tradition. Every age bears testimony to the wonderful events by
      which it was distinguished, and its testimony appears no less
      weighty and respectable than that of the preceding generation,
      till we are insensibly led on to accuse our own inconsistency, if
      in the eighth or in the twelfth century we deny to the venerable
      Bede, or to the holy Bernard, the same degree of confidence
      which, in the second century, we had so liberally granted to
      Justin or to Irenæus. 81 If the truth of any of those miracles is
      appreciated by their apparent use and propriety, every age had
      unbelievers to convince, heretics to confute, and idolatrous
      nations to convert; and sufficient motives might always be
      produced to justify the interposition of Heaven. And yet, since
      every friend to revelation is persuaded of the reality, and every
      reasonable man is convinced of the cessation, of miraculous
      powers, it is evident that there must have been _some period_ in
      which they were either suddenly or gradually withdrawn from the
      Christian church. Whatever æra is chosen for that purpose, the
      death of the apostles, the conversion of the Roman empire, or the
      extinction of the Arian heresy, 82 the insensibility of the
      Christians who lived at that time will equally afford a just
      matter of surprise. They still supported their pretensions after
      they had lost their power. Credulity performed the office of
      faith; fanaticism was permitted to assume the language of
      inspiration, and the effects of accident or contrivance were
      ascribed to supernatural causes. The recent experience of genuine
      miracles should have instructed the Christian world in the ways
      of Providence, and habituated their eye (if we may use a very
      inadequate expression) to the style of the divine artist. Should
      the most skilful painter of modern Italy presume to decorate his
      feeble imitations with the name of Raphæl or of Correggio, the
      insolent fraud would be soon discovered, and indignantly
      rejected.

      against his numerous adversaries.]

      81 (return) [It may seem somewhat remarkable, that Bernard of

      most usually fixed by Protestants. The more rational divines are

      Note: All this appears to proceed on the principle that any
      distinct line can be drawn in an unphilosophic age between
      wonders and miracles, or between what piety, from their
      unexpected and extraordinary nature, the marvellous concurrence
      of secondary causes to some remarkable end, may consider
      providential interpositions, and miracles strictly so called, in
      which the laws of nature are suspended or violated. It is
      impossible to assign, on one side, limits to human credulity, on
      the other, to the influence of the imagination on the bodily
      frame; but some of the miracles recorded in the Gospels are such
      palpable impossibilities, according to the known laws and
      operations of nature, that if recorded on sufficient evidence,
      and the evidence we believe to be that of eye-witnesses, we
      cannot reject them, without either asserting, with Hume, that no
      evidence can prove a miracle, or that the Author of Nature has no
      power of suspending its ordinary laws. But which of the
      post-apostolic miracles will bear this test?—M.]

      Whatever opinion may be entertained of the miracles of the
      primitive church since the time of the apostles, this unresisting
      softness of temper, so conspicuous among the believers of the
      second and third centuries, proved of some accidental benefit to
      the cause of truth and religion. In modern times, a latent and
      even involuntary scepticism adheres to the most pious
      dispositions. Their admission of supernatural truths is much less
      an active consent than a cold and passive acquiescence.
      Accustomed long since to observe and to respect the invariable
      order of Nature, our reason, or at least our imagination, is not
      sufficiently prepared to sustain the visible action of the Deity.

      But, in the first ages of Christianity, the situation of mankind
      was extremely different. The most curious, or the most credulous,
      among the Pagans, were often persuaded to enter into a society
      which asserted an actual claim of miraculous powers. The
      primitive Christians perpetually trod on mystic ground, and their
      minds were exercised by the habits of believing the most
      extraordinary events. They felt, or they fancied, that on every
      side they were incessantly assaulted by dæmons, comforted by
      visions, instructed by prophecy, and surprisingly delivered from
      danger, sickness, and from death itself, by the supplications of
      the church. The real or imaginary prodigies, of which they so
      frequently conceived themselves to be the objects, the
      instruments, or the spectators, very happily disposed them to
      adopt with the same ease, but with far greater justice, the
      authentic wonders of the evangelic history; and thus miracles
      that exceeded not the measure of their own experience, inspired
      them with the most lively assurance of mysteries which were
      acknowledged to surpass the limits of their understanding. It is
      this deep impression of supernatural truths which has been so
      much celebrated under the name of faith; a state of mind
      described as the surest pledge of the divine favor and of future
      felicity, and recommended as the first, or perhaps the only merit
      of a Christian. According to the more rigid doctors, the moral
      virtues, which may be equally practised by infidels, are
      destitute of any value or efficacy in the work of our
      justification.




      Chapter XV: Progress Of The Christian Religion.—Part V.

      IV. But the primitive Christian demonstrated his faith by his
      virtues; and it was very justly supposed that the divine
      persuasion, which enlightened or subdued the understanding, must,
      at the same time, purify the heart, and direct the actions, of
      the believer. The first apologists of Christianity who justify
      the innocence of their brethren, and the writers of a later
      period who celebrate the sanctity of their ancestors, display, in
      the most lively colors, the reformation of manners which was
      introduced into the world by the preaching of the gospel. As it
      is my intention to remark only such human causes as were
      permitted to second the influence of revelation, I shall slightly
      mention two motives which might naturally render the lives of the
      primitive Christians much purer and more austere than those of
      their Pagan contemporaries, or their degenerate successors;
      repentance for their past sins, and the laudable desire of
      supporting the reputation of the society in which they were
      engaged. 83

      83 (return) [ These, in the opinion of the editor, are the most
      uncandid paragraphs in Gibbon’s History. He ought either, with
      manly courage, to have denied the moral reformation introduced by
      Christianity, or fairly to have investigated all its motives; not
      to have confined himself to an insidious and sarcastic
      description of the less pure and generous elements of the
      Christian character as it appeared even at that early time.—M.]

      It is a very ancient reproach, suggested by the ignorance or the
      malice of infidelity, that the Christians allured into their
      party the most atrocious criminals, who, as soon as they were
      touched by a sense of remorse, were easily persuaded to wash
      away, in the water of baptism, the guilt of their past conduct,
      for which the temples of the gods refused to grant them any
      expiation. But this reproach, when it is cleared from
      misrepresentation, contributes as much to the honor as it did to
      the increase of the church. The friends of Christianity may
      acknowledge without a blush that many of the most eminent saints
      had been before their baptism the most abandoned sinners. Those
      persons, who in the world had followed, though in an imperfect
      manner, the dictates of benevolence and propriety, derived such a
      calm satisfaction from the opinion of their own rectitude, as
      rendered them much less susceptible of the sudden emotions of
      shame, of grief, and of terror, which have given birth to so many
      wonderful conversions. After the example of their divine Master,
      the missionaries of the gospel disdained not the society of men,
      and especially of women, oppressed by the consciousness, and very
      often by the effects, of their vices. As they emerged from sin
      and superstition to the glorious hope of immortality, they
      resolved to devote themselves to a life, not only of virtue, but
      of penitence. The desire of perfection became the ruling passion
      of their soul; and it is well known that, while reason embraces a
      cold mediocrity, our passions hurry us, with rapid violence, over
      the space which lies between the most opposite extremes. 83b

      83b (return) [The imputations of Celsus and Julian, with the
      defence of the fathers, are very fairly stated by Spanheim,

      When the new converts had been enrolled in the number of the
      faithful, and were admitted to the sacraments of the church, they
      found themselves restrained from relapsing into their past
      disorders by another consideration of a less spiritual, but of a
      very innocent and respectable nature. Any particular society that
      has departed from the great body of the nation, or the religion
      to which it belonged, immediately becomes the object of universal
      as well as invidious observation. In proportion to the smallness
      of its numbers, the character of the society may be affected by
      the virtues and vices of the persons who compose it; and every
      member is engaged to watch with the most vigilant attention over
      his own behavior, and over that of his brethren, since, as he
      must expect to incur a part of the common disgrace, he may hope
      to enjoy a share of the common reputation. When the Christians of
      Bithynia were brought before the tribunal of the younger Pliny,
      they assured the proconsul, that, far from being engaged in any
      unlawful conspiracy, they were bound by a solemn obligation to
      abstain from the commission of those crimes which disturb the
      private or public peace of society, from theft, robbery,
      adultery, perjury, and fraud. 84 841 Near a century afterwards,
      Tertullian, with an honest pride, could boast, that very few
      Christians had suffered by the hand of the executioner, except on
      account of their religion. 85 Their serious and sequestered life,
      averse to the gay luxury of the age, inured them to chastity,
      temperance, economy, and all the sober and domestic virtues. As
      the greater number were of some trade or profession, it was
      incumbent on them, by the strictest integrity and the fairest
      dealing, to remove the suspicions which the profane are too apt
      to conceive against the appearances of sanctity. The contempt of
      the world exercised them in the habits of humility, meekness, and
      patience. The more they were persecuted, the more closely they
      adhered to each other. Their mutual charity and unsuspecting
      confidence has been remarked by infidels, and was too often
      abused by perfidious friends. 86

      at least he knew none such.—G.]

      It is a very honorable circumstance for the morals of the
      primitive Christians, that even their faults, or rather errors,
      were derived from an excess of virtue. The bishops and doctors of
      the church, whose evidence attests, and whose authority might
      influence, the professions, the principles, and even the practice
      of their contemporaries, had studied the Scriptures with less
      skill than devotion; and they often received, in the most literal
      sense, those rigid precepts of Christ and the apostles, to which
      the prudence of succeeding commentators has applied a looser and
      more figurative mode of interpretation. Ambitious to exalt the
      perfection of the gospel above the wisdom of philosophy, the
      zealous fathers have carried the duties of self-mortification, of
      purity, and of patience, to a height which it is scarcely
      possible to attain, and much less to preserve, in our present
      state of weakness and corruption. A doctrine so extraordinary and
      so sublime must inevitably command the veneration of the people;
      but it was ill calculated to obtain the suffrage of those worldly
      philosophers who, in the conduct of this transitory life, consult
      only the feelings of nature and the interest of society. 87

      87 (return) [ See a very judicious treatise of Barbeyrac sur la
      Morale des Peres.]

      There are two very natural propensities which we may distinguish
      in the most virtuous and liberal dispositions, the love of
      pleasure and the love of action. If the former is refined by art
      and learning, improved by the charms of social intercourse, and
      corrected by a just regard to economy, to health, and to
      reputation, it is productive of the greatest part of the
      happiness of private life. The love of action is a principle of a
      much stronger and more doubtful nature. It often leads to anger,
      to ambition, and to revenge; but when it is guided by the sense
      of propriety and benevolence, it becomes the parent of every
      virtue, and if those virtues are accompanied with equal
      abilities, a family, a state, or an empire may be indebted for
      their safety and prosperity to the undaunted courage of a single
      man. To the love of pleasure we may therefore ascribe most of the
      agreeable, to the love of action we may attribute most of the
      useful and respectable, qualifications. The character in which
      both the one and the other should be united and harmonized would
      seem to constitute the most perfect idea of human nature. The
      insensible and inactive disposition, which should be supposed
      alike destitute of both, would be rejected, by the common consent
      of mankind, as utterly incapable of procuring any happiness to
      the individual, or any public benefit to the world. But it was
      not in _this_ world that the primitive Christians were desirous
      of making themselves either agreeable or useful. 871

      The acquisition of knowledge, the exercise of our reason or
      fancy, and the cheerful flow of unguarded conversation, may
      employ the leisure of a liberal mind. Such amusements, however,
      were rejected with abhorrence, or admitted with the utmost
      caution, by the severity of the fathers, who despised all
      knowledge that was not useful to salvation, and who considered
      all levity of discours as a criminal abuse of the gift of speech.
      In our present state of existence the body is so inseparably
      connected with the soul, that it seems to be our interest to
      taste, with innocence and moderation, the enjoyments of which
      that faithful companion is susceptible. Very different was the
      reasoning of our devout predecessors; vainly aspiring to imitate
      the perfection of angels, they disdained, or they affected to
      disdain, every earthly and corporeal delight. 88 Some of our
      senses indeed are necessary for our preservation, others for our
      subsistence, and others again for our information; and thus far
      it was impossible to reject the use of them. The first sensation
      of pleasure was marked as the first moment of their abuse. The
      unfeeling candidate for heaven was instructed, not only to resist
      the grosser allurements of the taste or smell, but even to shut
      his ears against the profane harmony of sounds, and to view with
      indifference the most finished productions of human art. Gay
      apparel, magnificent houses, and elegant furniture, were supposed
      to unite the double guilt of pride and of sensuality; a simple
      and mortified appearance was more suitable to the Christian who
      was certain of his sins and doubtful of his salvation. In their
      censures of luxury the fathers are extremely minute and
      circumstantial; 89 and among the various articles which excite
      their pious indignation we may enumerate false hair, garments of
      any color except white, instruments of music, vases of gold or
      silver, downy pillows, (as Jacob reposed his head on a stone,)
      white bread, foreign wines, public salutations, the use of warm
      baths, and the practice of shaving the beard, which, according to
      the expression of Tertullian, is a lie against our own faces, and
      an impious attempt to improve the works of the Creator. 90 When
      Christianity was introduced among the rich and the polite, the
      observation of these singular laws was left, as it would be at
      present, to the few who were ambitious of superior sanctity. But
      it is always easy, as well as agreeable, for the inferior ranks
      of mankind to claim a merit from the contempt of that pomp and
      pleasure which fortune has placed beyond their reach. The virtue
      of the primitive Christians, like that of the first Romans, was
      very frequently guarded by poverty and ignorance.

      The chaste severity of the fathers, in whatever related to the
      commerce of the two sexes, flowed from the same principle; their
      abhorrence of every enjoyment which might gratify the sensual,
      and degrade the spiritual nature of man. It was their favorite
      opinion, that if Adam had preserved his obedience to the Creator,
      he would have lived forever in a state of virgin purity, and that
      some harmless mode of vegetation might have peopled paradise with
      a race of innocent and immortal beings. 91 The use of marriage
      was permitted only to his fallen posterity, as a necessary
      expedient to continue the human species, and as a restraint,
      however imperfect, on the natural licentiousness of desire. The
      hesitation of the orthodox casuists on this interesting subject,
      betrays the perplexity of men, unwilling to approve an
      institution which they were compelled to tolerate. 92 The
      enumeration of the very whimsical laws, which they most
      circumstantially imposed on the marriage-bed, would force a smile
      from the young and a blush from the fair. It was their unanimous
      sentiment that a first marriage was adequate to all the purposes
      of nature and of society. The sensual connection was refined into
      a resemblance of the mystic union of Christ with his church, and
      was pronounced to be indissoluble either by divorce or by death.
      The practice of second nuptials was branded with the name of a
      legal adultery; and the persons who were guilty of so scandalous
      an offence against Christian purity, were soon excluded from the
      honors, and even from the alms, of the church. 93 Since desire
      was imputed as a crime, and marriage was tolerated as a defect,
      it was consistent with the same principles to consider a state of
      celibacy as the nearest approach to the divine perfection. It was
      with the utmost difficulty that ancient Rome could support the
      institution of six vestals; 94 but the primitive church was
      filled with a number of persons of either sex, who had devoted
      themselves to the profession of perpetual chastity. 95 A few of
      these, among whom we may reckon the learned Origen, judged it the
      most prudent to disarm the tempter. 96 Some were insensible and
      some were invincible against the assaults of the flesh.
      Disdaining an ignominious flight, the virgins of the warm climate
      of Africa encountered the enemy in the closest engagement; they
      permitted priests and deacons to share their bed, and gloried
      amidst the flames in their unsullied purity. But insulted Nature
      sometimes vindicated her rights, and this new species of
      martyrdom served only to introduce a new scandal into the church.
      97 Among the Christian ascetics, however, (a name which they soon
      acquired from their painful exercise,) many, as they were less
      presumptuous, were probably more successful. The loss of sensual
      pleasure was supplied and compensated by spiritual pride. Even
      the multitude of Pagans were inclined to estimate the merit of
      the sacrifice by its apparent difficulty; and it was in the
      praise of these chaste spouses of Christ that the fathers have
      poured forth the troubled stream of their eloquence. 98 Such are
      the early traces of monastic principles and institutions, which,
      in a subsequent age, have counterbalanced all the temporal
      advantages of Christianity. 99

      The Christians were not less averse to the business than to the
      pleasures of this world. The defence of our persons and property
      they knew not how to reconcile with the patient doctrine which
      enjoined an unlimited forgiveness of past injuries, and commanded
      them to invite the repetition of fresh insults. Their simplicity
      was offended by the use of oaths, by the pomp of magistracy, and
      by the active contention of public life; nor could their humane
      ignorance be convinced that it was lawful on any occasion to shed
      the blood of our fellow-creatures, either by the sword of
      justice, or by that of war; even though their criminal or hostile
      attempts should threaten the peace and safety of the whole
      community. 100 It was acknowledged that, under a less perfect
      law, the powers of the Jewish constitution had been exercised,
      with the approbation of heaven, by inspired prophets and by
      anointed kings. The Christians felt and confessed that such
      institutions might be necessary for the present system of the
      world, and they cheerfully submitted to the authority of their
      Pagan governors. But while they inculcated the maxims of passive
      obedience, they refused to take any active part in the civil
      administration or the military defence of the empire. Some
      indulgence might, perhaps, be allowed to those persons who,
      before their conversion, were already engaged in such violent and
      sanguinary occupations; 101a but it was impossible that the
      Christians, without renouncing a more sacred duty, could assume
      the character of soldiers, of magistrates, or of princes. 102b
      This indolent, or even criminal disregard to the public welfare,
      exposed them to the contempt and reproaches of the Pagans, who
      very frequently asked, what must be the fate of the empire,
      attacked on every side by the barbarians, if all mankind should
      adopt the pusillanimous sentiments of the new sect. 103 To this
      insulting question the Christian apologists returned obscure and
      ambiguous answers, as they were unwilling to reveal the secret
      cause of their security; the expectation that, before the
      conversion of mankind was accomplished, war, government, the
      Roman empire, and the world itself, would be no more. It may be
      observed, that, in this instance likewise, the situation of the
      first Christians coincided very happily with their religious
      scruples, and that their aversion to an active life contributed
      rather to excuse them from the service, than to exclude them from
      the honors, of the state and army.

      to them the expedient of deserting; a counsel which, if it had
      been generally known, was not very proper to conciliate the favor
      of the emperors towards the Christian sect. * Note: There is
      nothing which ought to astonish us in the refusal of the
      primitive Christians to take part in public affairs; it was the
      natural consequence of the contrariety of their principles to the
      customs, laws, and active life of the Pagan world. As Christians,
      they could not enter into the senate, which, according to Gibbon
      himself, always assembled in a temple or consecrated place, and
      where each senator, before he took his seat, made a libation of a
      few drops of wine, and burnt incense on the altar; as Christians,
      they could not assist at festivals and banquets, which always
      terminated with libations, &c.; finally, as “the innumerable
      deities and rites of polytheism were closely interwoven with
      every circumstance of public and private life,” the Christians
      could not participate in them without incurring, according to
      their principles, the guilt of impiety. It was then much less by
      an effect of their doctrine, than by the consequence of their
      situation, that they stood aloof from public business. Whenever
      this situation offered no impediment, they showed as much
      activity as the Pagans. Proinde, says Justin Martyr, (Apol. c.
      17,) nos solum Deum adoramus, et vobis in rebus aliis læti
      inservimus.—G. ——-This latter passage, M. Guizot quotes in Latin;
      if he had consulted the original, he would have found it to be
      altogether irrelevant: it merely relates to the payment of
      taxes.—M. — —Tertullian does not suggest to the soldiers the
      expedient of deserting; he says that they ought to be constantly
      on their guard to do nothing during their service contrary to the
      law of God, and to resolve to suffer martyrdom rather than submit
      to a base compliance, or openly to renounce the service. (De Cor.
      Mil. ii. p. 127.) He does not positively decide that the military
      service is not permitted to Christians; he ends, indeed, by
      saying, Puta denique licere militiam usque ad causam coronæ.—G.
      ——M. Guizot is. I think, again unfortunate in his defence of
      Tertullian. That father says, that many Christian soldiers had
      deserted, aut deserendum statim sit, ut a multis actum. The
      latter sentence, Puta, &c, &c., is a concession for the sake of
      argument: wha follows is more to the purpose.—M. Many other
      passages of Tertullian prove that the army was full of
      Christians, Hesterni sumus et vestra omnia implevimus, urbes,
      insulas, castella, municipia, conciliabula, castra ipsa. (Apol.
      c. 37.) Navigamus et not vobiscum et militamus. (c. 42.) Origen,
      in truth, appears to have maintained a more rigid opinion, (Cont.
      Cels. l. viii.;) but he has often renounced this exaggerated
      severity, perhaps necessary to produce great results, and he
      speaks of the profession of arms as an honorable one. (l. iv. c.
      218.)— G. ——On these points Christian opinion, it should seem,
      was much divided Tertullian, when he wrote the De Cor. Mil., was
      evidently inclining to more ascetic opinions, and Origen was of
      the same class. See Neander, vol. l part ii. p. 305, edit.

      Chapter XV: Progress Of The Christian Religion.—Part VI.

      V. But the human character, however it may be exalted or
      depressed by a temporary enthusiasm, will return by degrees to
      its proper and natural level, and will resume those passions that
      seem the most adapted to its present condition. The primitive
      Christians were dead to the business and pleasures of the world;
      but their love of action, which could never be entirely
      extinguished, soon revived, and found a new occupation in the
      government of the church. A separate society, which attacked the
      established religion of the empire, was obliged to adopt some
      form of internal policy, and to appoint a sufficient number of
      ministers, intrusted not only with the spiritual functions, but
      even with the temporal direction of the Christian commonwealth.
      The safety of that society, its honor, its aggrandizement, were
      productive, even in the most pious minds, of a spirit of
      patriotism, such as the first of the Romans had felt for the
      republic, and sometimes of a similar indifference, in the use of
      whatever means might probably conduce to so desirable an end. The
      ambition of raising themselves or their friends to the honors and
      offices of the church, was disguised by the laudable intention of
      devoting to the public benefit the power and consideration,
      which, for that purpose only, it became their duty to solicit. In
      the exercise of their functions, they were frequently called upon
      to detect the errors of heresy or the arts of faction, to oppose
      the designs of perfidious brethren, to stigmatize their
      characters with deserved infamy, and to expel them from the bosom
      of a society whose peace and happiness they had attempted to
      disturb. The ecclesiastical governors of the Christians were
      taught to unite the wisdom of the serpent with the innocence of
      the dove; but as the former was refined, so the latter was
      insensibly corrupted, by the habits of government. In the church
      as well as in the world, the persons who were placed in any
      public station rendered themselves considerable by their
      eloquence and firmness, by their knowledge of mankind, and by
      their dexterity in business; and while they concealed from
      others, and perhaps from themselves, the secret motives of their
      conduct, they too frequently relapsed into all the turbulent
      passions of active life, which were tinctured with an additional
      degree of bitterness and obstinacy from the infusion of spiritual
      zeal.

      The government of the church has often been the subject, as well
      as the prize, of religious contention. The hostile disputants of
      Rome, of Paris, of Oxford, and of Geneva, have alike struggled to
      reduce the primitive and apostolic model 1041 to the respective
      standards of their own policy. The few who have pursued this
      inquiry with more candor and impartiality, are of opinion, 105
      that the apostles declined the office of legislation, and rather
      chose to endure some partial scandals and divisions, than to
      exclude the Christians of a future age from the liberty of
      varying their forms of ecclesiastical government according to the
      changes of times and circumstances. The scheme of policy, which,
      under their approbation, was adopted for the use of the first
      century, may be discovered from the practice of Jerusalem, of
      Ephesus, or of Corinth. The societies which were instituted in
      the cities of the Roman empire were united only by the ties of
      faith and charity. Independence and equality formed the basis of
      their internal constitution. The want of discipline and human
      learning was supplied by the occasional assistance of the
      _prophets_, 106 who were called to that function without
      distinction of age, of sex, 1061 or of natural abilities, and
      who, as often as they felt the divine impulse, poured forth the
      effusions of the Spirit in the assembly of the faithful. But
      these extraordinary gifts were frequently abused or misapplied by
      the prophetic teachers. They displayed them at an improper
      season, presumptuously disturbed the service of the assembly,
      and, by their pride or mistaken zeal, they introduced,
      particularly into the apostolic church of Corinth, a long and
      melancholy train of disorders. 107 As the institution of prophets
      became useless, and even pernicious, their powers were withdrawn,
      and their office abolished. The public functions of religion were
      solely intrusted to the established ministers of the church, the
      _bishops_ and the _presbyters;_ two appellations which, in their
      first origin, appear to have distinguished the same office and
      the same order of persons. The name of Presbyter was expressive
      of their age, or rather of their gravity and wisdom. The title of
      Bishop denoted their inspection over the faith and manners of the
      Christians who were committed to their pastoral care. In
      proportion to the respective numbers of the faithful, a larger or
      smaller number of these _episcopal presbyters_ guided each infant
      congregation with equal authority and with united counsels. 108

      1041 (return) [ The aristocratical party in France, as well as in

      107 (return) [ See the epistles of St. Paul, and of Clemens, to
      the Corinthians. * Note: The first ministers established in the
      church were the deacons, appointed at Jerusalem, seven in number;
      they were charged with the distribution of the alms; even females
      had a share in this employment. After the deacons came the elders
      or priests, charged with the maintenance of order and decorum in
      the community, and to act every where in its name. The bishops
      were afterwards charged to watch over the faith and the
      instruction of the disciples: the apostles themselves appointed
      several bishops. Tertullian, (adv. Marium, c. v.,) Clement of
      Alexandria, and many fathers of the second and third century, do
      not permit us to doubt this fact. The equality of rank between
      these different functionaries did not prevent their functions
      being, even in their origin, distinct; they became subsequently
      still more so. See Plank, Geschichte der Christ. Kirch.
      Verfassung., vol. i. p. 24.—G. On this extremely obscure subject,
      which has been so much perplexed by passion and interest, it is
      impossible to justify any opinion without entering into long and
      controversial details.——It must be admitted, in opposition to
      Plank, that in the New Testament, several words are sometimes
      indiscriminately used. (Acts xx. v. 17, comp. with 28 Tit. i. 5
      and 7. Philip. i. 1.) But it is as clear, that as soon as we can
      discern the form of church government, at a period closely
      bordering upon, if not within, the apostolic age, it appears with
      a bishop at the head of each community, holding some superiority
      over the presbyters. Whether he was, as Gibbon from Mosheim
      supposes, merely an elective head of the College of Presbyters,
      (for this we have, in fact, no valid authority,) or whether his
      distinct functions were established on apostolic authority, is
      still contested. The universal submission to this episcopacy, in
      every part of the Christian world appears to me strongly to favor
      the latter view.—M.]

      108 (return) [ Hooker’s Ecclesiastical Polity, l. vii.]

      But the most perfect equality of freedom requires the directing
      hand of a superior magistrate: and the order of public
      deliberations soon introduces the office of a president, invested
      at least with the authority of collecting the sentiments, and of
      executing the resolutions, of the assembly. A regard for the
      public tranquillity, which would so frequently have been
      interrupted by annual or by occasional elections, induced the
      primitive Christians to constitute an honorable and perpetual
      magistracy, and to choose one of the wisest and most holy among
      their presbyters to execute, during his life, the duties of their
      ecclesiastical governor. It was under these circumstances that
      the lofty title of Bishop began to raise itself above the humble
      appellation of Presbyter; and while the latter remained the most
      natural distinction for the members of every Christian senate,
      the former was appropriated to the dignity of its new president.
      109 The advantages of this episcopal form of government, which
      appears to have been introduced before the end of the first
      century, 110 were so obvious, and so important for the future
      greatness, as well as the present peace, of Christianity, that it
      was adopted without delay by all the societies which were already
      scattered over the empire, had acquired in a very early period
      the sanction of antiquity, 111 and is still revered by the most
      powerful churches, both of the East and of the West, as a
      primitive and even as a divine establishment. 112 It is needless
      to observe, that the pious and humble presbyters, who were first
      dignified with the episcopal title, could not possess, and would
      probably have rejected, the power and pomp which now encircles
      the tiara of the Roman pontiff, or the mitre of a German prelate.
      But we may define, in a few words, the narrow limits of their
      original jurisdiction, which was chiefly of a spiritual, though
      in some instances of a temporal nature. 113 It consisted in the
      administration of the sacraments and discipline of the church,
      the superintendency of religious ceremonies, which imperceptibly
      increased in number and variety, the consecration of
      ecclesiastical ministers, to whom the bishop assigned their
      respective functions, the management of the public fund, and the
      determination of all such differences as the faithful were
      unwilling to expose before the tribunal of an idolatrous judge.
      These powers, during a short period, were exercised according to
      the advice of the presbyteral college, and with the consent and
      approbation of the assembly of Christians. The primitive bishops
      were considered only as the first of their equals, and the
      honorable servants of a free people. Whenever the episcopal chair
      became vacant by death, a new president was chosen among the
      presbyters by the suffrage of the whole congregation, every
      member of which supposed himself invested with a sacred and
      sacerdotal character. 114

      distinguished.—M.]

      Such was the mild and equal constitution by which the Christians
      were governed more than a hundred years after the death of the
      apostles. Every society formed within itself a separate and
      independent republic; and although the most distant of these
      little states maintained a mutual as well as friendly intercourse
      of letters and deputations, the Christian world was not yet
      connected by any supreme authority or legislative assembly. As
      the numbers of the faithful were gradually multiplied, they
      discovered the advantages that might result from a closer union
      of their interest and designs. Towards the end of the second
      century, the churches of Greece and Asia adopted the useful
      institutions of provincial synods, 1141 and they may justly be
      supposed to have borrowed the model of a representative council
      from the celebrated examples of their own country, the
      Amphictyons, the Achæan league, or the assemblies of the Ionian
      cities. It was soon established as a custom and as a law, that
      the bishops of the independent churches should meet in the
      capital of the province at the stated periods of spring and
      autumn. Their deliberations were assisted by the advice of a few
      distinguished presbyters, and moderated by the presence of a
      listening multitude. 115 Their decrees, which were styled Canons,
      regulated every important controversy of faith and discipline;
      and it was natural to believe that a liberal effusion of the Holy
      Spirit would be poured on the united assembly of the delegates of
      the Christian people. The institution of synods was so well
      suited to private ambition, and to public interest, that in the
      space of a few years it was received throughout the whole empire.
      A regular correspondence was established between the provincial
      councils, which mutually communicated and approved their
      respective proceedings; and the catholic church soon assumed the
      form, and acquired the strength, of a great fœderative republic.
      116

      1141 (return) [ The synods were not the first means taken by the
      insulated churches to enter into communion and to assume a
      corporate character. The dioceses were first formed by the union
      of several country churches with a church in a city: many
      churches in one city uniting among themselves, or joining a more
      considerable church, became metropolitan. The dioceses were not
      formed before the beginning of the second century: before that
      time the Christians had not established sufficient churches in
      the country to stand in need of that union. It is towards the
      middle of the same century that we discover the first traces of
      the metropolitan constitution. (Probably the country churches
      were founded in general by missionaries from those in the city,
      and would preserve a natural connection with the parent
      church.)—M. ——The provincial synods did not commence till towards
      the middle of the third century, and were not the first synods.
      History gives us distinct notions of the synods, held towards the
      end of the second century, at Ephesus at Jerusalem, at Pontus,
      and at Rome, to put an end to the disputes which had arisen
      between the Latin and Asiatic churches about the celebration of
      Easter. But these synods were not subject to any regular form or
      periodical return; this regularity was first established with the
      provincial synods, which were formed by a union of the bishops of
      a district, subject to a metropolitan. Plank, p. 90. Geschichte

      the Christian churches is very ably explained by Mosheim, p. 164
      170.]

      As the legislative authority of the particular churches was
      insensibly superseded by the use of councils, the bishops
      obtained by their alliance a much larger share of executive and
      arbitrary power; and as soon as they were connected by a sense of
      their common interest, they were enabled to attack, with united
      vigor, the original rights of their clergy and people. The
      prelates of the third century imperceptibly changed the language
      of exhortation into that of command, scattered the seeds of
      future usurpations, and supplied, by scripture allegories and
      declamatory rhetoric, their deficiency of force and of reason.
      They exalted the unity and power of the church, as it was
      represented in the episcopal office, of which every bishop
      enjoyed an equal and undivided portion. 117 Princes and
      magistrates, it was often repeated, might boast an earthly claim
      to a transitory dominion; it was the episcopal authority alone
      which was derived from the Deity, and extended itself over this
      and over another world. The bishops were the vicegerents of
      Christ, the successors of the apostles, and the mystic
      substitutes of the high priest of the Mosaic law. Their exclusive
      privilege of conferring the sacerdotal character invaded the
      freedom both of clerical and of popular elections; and if, in the
      administration of the church, they still consulted the judgment
      of the presbyters, or the inclination of the people, they most
      carefully inculcated the merit of such a voluntary condescension.
      The bishops acknowledged the supreme authority which resided in
      the assembly of their brethren; but in the government of his
      peculiar diocese, each of them exacted from his _flock_ the same
      implicit obedience as if that favorite metaphor had been
      literally just, and as if the shepherd had been of a more exalted
      nature than that of his sheep. 118 This obedience, however, was
      not imposed without some efforts on one side, and some resistance
      on the other. The democratical part of the constitution was, in
      many places, very warmly supported by the zealous or interested
      opposition of the inferior clergy. But their patriotism received
      the ignominious epithets of faction and schism; and the episcopal
      cause was indebted for its rapid progress to the labors of many
      active prelates, who, like Cyprian of Carthage, could reconcile
      the arts of the most ambitious statesman with the Christian
      virtues which seem adapted to the character of a saint and
      martyr. 119

      207—378,) has laid him open with great freedom and accuracy.]

      account of these obscure quarrels, see Mosheim, p. 497—512.]

      The same causes which at first had destroyed the equality of the
      presbyters introduced among the bishops a preeminence of rank,
      and from thence a superiority of jurisdiction. As often as in the
      spring and autumn they met in provincial synod, the difference of
      personal merit and reputation was very sensibly felt among the
      members of the assembly, and the multitude was governed by the
      wisdom and eloquence of the few. But the order of public
      proceedings required a more regular and less invidious
      distinction; the office of perpetual presidents in the councils
      of each province was conferred on the bishops of the principal
      city; and these aspiring prelates, who soon acquired the lofty
      titles of Metropolitans and Primates, secretly prepared
      themselves to usurp over their episcopal brethren the same
      authority which the bishops had so lately assumed above the
      college of presbyters. 120 Nor was it long before an emulation of
      preeminence and power prevailed among the Metropolitans
      themselves, each of them affecting to display, in the most
      pompous terms, the temporal honors and advantages of the city
      over which he presided; the numbers and opulence of the
      Christians who were subject to their pastoral care; the saints
      and martyrs who had arisen among them; and the purity with which
      they preserved the tradition of the faith, as it had been
      transmitted through a series of orthodox bishops from the apostle
      or the apostolic disciple, to whom the foundation of their church
      was ascribed. 121 From every cause, either of a civil or of an
      ecclesiastical nature, it was easy to foresee that Rome must
      enjoy the respect, and would soon claim the obedience, of the
      provinces. The society of the faithful bore a just proportion to
      the capital of the empire; and the Roman church was the greatest,
      the most numerous, and, in regard to the West, the most ancient
      of all the Christian establishments, many of which had received
      their religion from the pious labors of her missionaries. Instead
      of one apostolic founder, the utmost boast of Antioch, of
      Ephesus, or of Corinth, the banks of the Tyber were supposed to
      have been honored with the preaching and martyrdom of the two
      most eminent among the apostles; 122 and the bishops of Rome very
      prudently claimed the inheritance of whatsoever prerogatives were
      attributed either to the person or to the office of St. Peter.
      123 The bishops of Italy and of the provinces were disposed to
      allow them a primacy of order and association (such was their
      very accurate expression) in the Christian aristocracy. 124 But
      the power of a monarch was rejected with abhorrence, and the
      aspiring genius of Rome experienced from the nations of Asia and
      Africa a more vigorous resistance to her spiritual, than she had
      formerly done to her temporal, dominion. The patriotic Cyprian,
      who ruled with the most absolute sway the church of Carthage and
      the provincial synods, opposed with resolution and success the
      ambition of the Roman pontiff, artfully connected his own cause
      with that of the eastern bishops, and, like Hannibal, sought out
      new allies in the heart of Asia. 125 If this Punic war was
      carried on without any effusion of blood, it was owing much less
      to the moderation than to the weakness of the contending
      prelates. Invectives and excommunications were _their_ only
      weapons; and these, during the progress of the whole controversy,
      they hurled against each other with equal fury and devotion. The
      hard necessity of censuring either a pope, or a saint and martyr,
      distresses the modern Catholics whenever they are obliged to
      relate the particulars of a dispute in which the champions of
      religion indulged such passions as seem much more adapted to the
      senate or to the camp. 126

      The progress of the ecclesiastical authority gave birth to the
      memorable distinction of the laity and of the clergy, which had
      been unknown to the Greeks and Romans. 127 The former of these
      appellations comprehended the body of the Christian people; the
      latter, according to the signification of the word, was
      appropriated to the chosen portion that had been set apart for
      the service of religion; a celebrated order of men, which has
      furnished the most important, though not always the most
      edifying, subjects for modern history. Their mutual hostilities
      sometimes disturbed the peace of the infant church, but their
      zeal and activity were united in the common cause, and the love
      of power, which (under the most artful disguises) could insinuate
      itself into the breasts of bishops and martyrs, animated them to
      increase the number of their subjects, and to enlarge the limits
      of the Christian empire. They were destitute of any temporal
      force, and they were for a long time discouraged and oppressed,
      rather than assisted, by the civil magistrate; but they had
      acquired, and they employed within their own society, the two
      most efficacious instruments of government, rewards and
      punishments; the former derived from the pious liberality, the
      latter from the devout apprehensions, of the faithful.

      Chapter XV: Progress Of The Christian Religion.—Part VII

      I. The community of goods, which had so agreeably amused the
      imagination of Plato, 128 and which subsisted in some degree
      among the austere sect of the Essenians, 129 was adopted for a
      short time in the primitive church. The fervor of the first
      proselytes prompted them to sell those worldly possessions, which
      they despised, to lay the price of them at the feet of the
      apostles, and to content themselves with receiving an equal share
      out of the general distribution. 130 The progress of the
      Christian religion relaxed, and gradually abolished, this
      generous institution, which, in hands less pure than those of the
      apostles, would too soon have been corrupted and abused by the
      returning selfishness of human nature; and the converts who
      embraced the new religion were permitted to retain the possession
      of their patrimony, to receive legacies and inheritances, and to
      increase their separate property by all the lawful means of trade
      and industry. Instead of an absolute sacrifice, a moderate
      proportion was accepted by the ministers of the gospel; and in
      their weekly or monthly assemblies, every believer, according to
      the exigency of the occasion, and the measure of his wealth and
      piety, presented his voluntary offering for the use of the common
      fund. 131 Nothing, however inconsiderable, was refused; but it
      was diligently inculcated that, in the article of Tithes, the
      Mosaic law was still of divine obligation; and that since the
      Jews, under a less perfect discipline, had been commanded to pay
      a tenth part of all that they possessed, it would become the
      disciples of Christ to distinguish themselves by a superior
      degree of liberality, 132 and to acquire some merit by resigning
      a superfluous treasure, which must so soon be annihilated with
      the world itself. 133 It is almost unnecessary to observe, that
      the revenue of each particular church, which was of so uncertain
      and fluctuating a nature, must have varied with the poverty or
      the opulence of the faithful, as they were dispersed in obscure
      villages, or collected in the great cities of the empire. In the
      time of the emperor Decius, it was the opinion of the
      magistrates, that the Christians of Rome were possessed of very
      considerable wealth; that vessels of gold and silver were used in
      their religious worship, and that many among their proselytes had
      sold their lands and houses to increase the public riches of the
      sect, at the expense, indeed, of their unfortunate children, who
      found themselves beggars, because their parents had been saints.
      134 We should listen with distrust to the suspicions of strangers
      and enemies: on this occasion, however, they receive a very
      specious and probable color from the two following circumstances,
      the only ones that have reached our knowledge, which define any
      precise sums, or convey any distinct idea. Almost at the same
      period, the bishop of Carthage, from a society less opulent than
      that of Rome, collected a hundred thousand sesterces, (above
      eight hundred and fifty pounds sterling,) on a sudden call of
      charity to redeem the brethren of Numidia, who had been carried
      away captives by the barbarians of the desert. 135 About a
      hundred years before the reign of Decius, the Roman church had
      received, in a single donation, the sum of two hundred thousand
      sesterces from a stranger of Pontus, who proposed to fix his
      residence in the capital. 136 These oblations, for the most part,
      were made in money; nor was the society of Christians either
      desirous or capable of acquiring, to any considerable degree, the
      encumbrance of landed property. It had been provided by several
      laws, which were enacted with the same design as our statutes of
      mortmain, that no real estates should be given or bequeathed to
      any corporate body, without either a special privilege or a
      particular dispensation from the emperor or from the senate; 137
      who were seldom disposed to grant them in favor of a sect, at
      first the object of their contempt, and at last of their fears
      and jealousy. A transaction, however, is related under the reign
      of Alexander Severus, which discovers that the restraint was
      sometimes eluded or suspended, and that the Christians were
      permitted to claim and to possess lands within the limits of Rome
      itself. 138 The progress of Christianity, and the civil confusion
      of the empire, contributed to relax the severity of the laws; and
      before the close of the third century many considerable estates
      were bestowed on the opulent churches of Rome, Milan, Carthage,
      Antioch, Alexandria, and the other great cities of Italy and the
      provinces.

      the Roman church; it was undoubtedly very considerable; but Fra
      Paolo (c. 3) appears to exaggerate, when he supposes that the
      successors of Commodus were urged to persecute the Christians by
      their own avarice, or that of their Prætorian præfects.]

      The bishop was the natural steward of the church; the public
      stock was intrusted to his care without account or control; the
      presbyters were confined to their spiritual functions, and the
      more dependent order of the deacons was solely employed in the
      management and distribution of the ecclesiastical revenue. 139 If
      we may give credit to the vehement declamations of Cyprian, there
      were too many among his African brethren, who, in the execution
      of their charge, violated every precept, not only of evangelical
      perfection, but even of moral virtue. By some of these unfaithful
      stewards the riches of the church were lavished in sensual
      pleasures; by others they were perverted to the purposes of
      private gain, of fraudulent purchases, and of rapacious usury.
      140 But as long as the contributions of the Christian people were
      free and unconstrained, the abuse of their confidence could not
      be very frequent, and the general uses to which their liberality
      was applied reflected honor on the religious society. A decent
      portion was reserved for the maintenance of the bishop and his
      clergy; a sufficient sum was allotted for the expenses of the
      public worship, of which the feasts of love, the _agapæ_, as they
      were called, constituted a very pleasing part. The whole
      remainder was the sacred patrimony of the poor. According to the
      discretion of the bishop, it was distributed to support widows
      and orphans, the lame, the sick, and the aged of the community;
      to comfort strangers and pilgrims, and to alleviate the
      misfortunes of prisoners and captives, more especially when their
      sufferings had been occasioned by their firm attachment to the
      cause of religion. 141 A generous intercourse of charity united
      the most distant provinces, and the smaller congregations were
      cheerfully assisted by the alms of their more opulent brethren.
      142 Such an institution, which paid less regard to the merit than
      to the distress of the object, very materially conduced to the
      progress of Christianity. The Pagans, who were actuated by a
      sense of humanity, while they derided the doctrines, acknowledged
      the benevolence, of the new sect. 143 The prospect of immediate
      relief and of future protection allured into its hospitable bosom
      many of those unhappy persons whom the neglect of the world would
      have abandoned to the miseries of want, of sickness, and of old
      age. There is some reason likewise to believe that great numbers
      of infants, who, according to the inhuman practice of the times,
      had been exposed by their parents, were frequently rescued from
      death, baptized, educated, and maintained by the piety of the
      Christians, and at the expense of the public treasure. 144

      II. It is the undoubted right of every society to exclude from
      its communion and benefits such among its members as reject or
      violate those regulations which have been established by general
      consent. In the exercise of this power, the censures of the
      Christian church were chiefly directed against scandalous
      sinners, and particularly those who were guilty of murder, of
      fraud, or of incontinence; against the authors or the followers
      of any heretical opinions which had been condemned by the
      judgment of the episcopal order; and against those unhappy
      persons, who, whether from choice or compulsion, had polluted
      themselves after their baptism by any act of idolatrous worship.
      The consequences of excommunication were of a temporal as well as
      a spiritual nature. The Christian against whom it was pronounced
      was deprived of any part in the oblations of the faithful. The
      ties both of religious and of private friendship were dissolved:
      he found himself a profane object of abhorrence to the persons
      whom he the most esteemed, or by whom he had been the most
      tenderly beloved; and as far as an expulsion from a respectable
      society could imprint on his character a mark of disgrace, he was
      shunned or suspected by the generality of mankind. The situation
      of these unfortunate exiles was in itself very painful and
      melancholy; but, as it usually happens, their apprehensions far
      exceeded their sufferings. The benefits of the Christian
      communion were those of eternal life; nor could they erase from
      their minds the awful opinion, that to those ecclesiastical
      governors by whom they were condemned, the Deity had committed
      the keys of Hell and of Paradise. The heretics, indeed, who might
      be supported by the consciousness of their intentions, and by the
      flattering hope that they alone had discovered the true path of
      salvation, endeavored to regain, in their separate assemblies,
      those comforts, temporal as well as spiritual, which they no
      longer derived from the great society of Christians. But almost
      all those who had reluctantly yielded to the power of vice or
      idolatry were sensible of their fallen condition, and anxiously
      desirous of being restored to the benefits of the Christian
      communion.

      With regard to the treatment of these penitents, two opposite
      opinions, the one of justice, the other of mercy, divided the
      primitive church. The more rigid and inflexible casuists refused
      them forever, and without exception, the meanest place in the
      holy community, which they had disgraced or deserted; and leaving
      them to the remorse of a guilty conscience, indulged them only
      with a faint ray of hope that the contrition of their life and
      death might possibly be accepted by the Supreme Being. 145 A
      milder sentiment was embraced, in practice as well as in theory,
      by the purest and most respectable of the Christian churches. 146
      The gates of reconciliation and of heaven were seldom shut
      against the returning penitent; but a severe and solemn form of
      discipline was instituted, which, while it served to expiate his
      crime, might powerfully deter the spectators from the imitation
      of his example. Humbled by a public confession, emaciated by
      fasting and clothed in sackcloth, the penitent lay prostrate at
      the door of the assembly, imploring with tears the pardon of his
      offences, and soliciting the prayers of the faithful. 147 If the
      fault was of a very heinous nature, whole years of penance were
      esteemed an inadequate satisfaction to the divine justice; and it
      was always by slow and painful gradations that the sinner, the
      heretic, or the apostate, was readmitted into the bosom of the
      church. A sentence of perpetual excommunication was, however,
      reserved for some crimes of an extraordinary magnitude, and
      particularly for the inexcusable relapses of those penitents who
      had already experienced and abused the clemency of their
      ecclesiastical superiors. According to the circumstances or the
      number of the guilty, the exercise of the Christian discipline
      was varied by the discretion of the bishops. The councils of
      Ancyra and Illiberis were held about the same time, the one in
      Galatia, the other in Spain; but their respective canons, which
      are still extant, seem to breathe a very different spirit. The
      Galatian, who after his baptism had repeatedly sacrificed to
      idols, might obtain his pardon by a penance of seven years; and
      if he had seduced others to imitate his example, only three years
      more were added to the term of his exile. But the unhappy
      Spaniard, who had committed the same offence, was deprived of the
      hope of reconciliation, even in the article of death; and his
      idolatry was placed at the head of a list of seventeen other
      crimes, against which a sentence no less terrible was pronounced.
      Among these we may distinguish the inexpiable guilt of
      calumniating a bishop, a presbyter, or even a deacon. 148

      145 (return) [ The Montanists and the Novatians, who adhered to

      ii. p. 304—313, a short but rational exposition of the canons of
      those councils, which were assembled in the first moments of
      tranquillity, after the persecution of Diocletian. This
      persecution had been much less severely felt in Spain than in
      Galatia; a difference which may, in some measure account for the
      contrast of their regulations.]

      The well-tempered mixture of liberality and rigor, the judicious
      dispensation of rewards and punishments, according to the maxims
      of policy as well as justice, constituted the _human_ strength of
      the church. The Bishops, whose paternal care extended itself to
      the government of both worlds, were sensible of the importance of
      these prerogatives; and covering their ambition with the fair
      pretence of the love of order, they were jealous of any rival in
      the exercise of a discipline so necessary to prevent the
      desertion of those troops which had enlisted themselves under the
      banner of the cross, and whose numbers every day became more
      considerable. From the imperious declamations of Cyprian, we
      should naturally conclude that the doctrines of excommunication
      and penance formed the most essential part of religion; and that
      it was much less dangerous for the disciples of Christ to neglect
      the observance of the moral duties, than to despise the censures
      and authority of their bishops. Sometimes we might imagine that
      we were listening to the voice of Moses, when he commanded the
      earth to open, and to swallow up, in consuming flames, the
      rebellious race which refused obedience to the priesthood of
      Aaron; and we should sometimes suppose that we heard a Roman
      consul asserting the majesty of the republic, and declaring his
      inflexible resolution to enforce the rigor of the laws. “If such
      irregularities are suffered with impunity,” (it is thus that the
      bishop of Carthage chides the lenity of his colleague,) “if such
      irregularities are suffered, there is an end of EPISCOPAL VIGOR;
      149 an end of the sublime and divine power of governing the
      Church, an end of Christianity itself.” Cyprian had renounced
      those temporal honors which it is probable he would never have
      obtained; but the acquisition of such absolute command over the
      consciences and understanding of a congregation, however obscure
      or despised by the world, is more truly grateful to the pride of
      the human heart than the possession of the most despotic power,
      imposed by arms and conquest on a reluctant people.

      1491] (return) [ Gibbon has been accused of injustice to the
      character of Cyprian, as exalting the “censures and authority of
      the church above the observance of the moral duties.”
      Felicissimus had been condemned by a synod of bishops, (non
      tantum mea, sed plurimorum coepiscorum, sententia condemnatum,)
      on the charge not only of schism, but of embezzlement of public
      money, the debauching of virgins, and frequent acts of adultery.
      His violent menaces had extorted his readmission into the church,
      against which Cyprian protests with much vehemence: ne pecuniæ
      commissæ sibi fraudator, ne stuprator virginum, ne matrimoniorum
      multorum depopulator et corruptor, ultra adhuc sponsam Christi
      incorruptam præsentiæ suæ dedecore, et impudica atque incesta
      contagione, violaret. See Chelsum’s Remarks, p. 134. If these
      charges against Felicissimus were true, they were something more
      than “irregularities,” A Roman censor would have been a fairer
      subject of comparison than a consul. On the other hand, it must
      be admitted that the charge of adultery deepens very rapidly as
      the controversy becomes more violent. It is first represented as
      a single act, recently detected, and which men of character were
      prepared to substantiate: adulterii etiam crimen accedit. quod
      patres nostri graves viri deprehendisse se nuntiaverunt, et
      probaturos se asseverarunt. Epist. xxxviii. The heretic has now
      darkened into a man of notorious and general profligacy. Nor can
      it be denied that of the whole long epistle, very far the larger
      and the more passionate part dwells on the breach of
      ecclesiastical unity rather than on the violation of Christian
      holiness.—M.]

      In the course of this important, though perhaps tedious inquiry,
      I have attempted to display the secondary causes which so
      efficaciously assisted the truth of the Christian religion. If
      among these causes we have discovered any artificial ornaments,
      any accidental circumstances, or any mixture of error and
      passion, it cannot appear surprising that mankind should be the
      most sensibly affected by such motives as were suited to their
      imperfect nature. It was by the aid of these causes, exclusive
      zeal, the immediate expectation of another world, the claim of
      miracles, the practice of rigid virtue, and the constitution of
      the primitive church, that Christianity spread itself with so
      much success in the Roman empire. To the first of these the
      Christians were indebted for their invincible valor, which
      disdained to capitulate with the enemy whom they were resolved to
      vanquish. The three succeeding causes supplied their valor with
      the most formidable arms. The last of these causes united their
      courage, directed their arms, and gave their efforts that
      irresistible weight, which even a small band of well-trained and
      intrepid volunteers has so often possessed over an undisciplined
      multitude, ignorant of the subject and careless of the event of
      the war. In the various religions of Polytheism, some wandering
      fanatics of Egypt and Syria, who addressed themselves to the
      credulous superstition of the populace, were perhaps the only
      order of priests 150 that derived their whole support and credit
      from their sacerdotal profession, and were very deeply affected
      by a personal concern for the safety or prosperity of their
      tutelar deities. The ministers of Polytheism, both in Rome and in
      the provinces, were, for the most part, men of a noble birth, and
      of an affluent fortune, who received, as an honorable
      distinction, the care of a celebrated temple, or of a public
      sacrifice, exhibited, very frequently at their own expense, the
      sacred games, 151 and with cold indifference performed the
      ancient rites, according to the laws and fashion of their
      country. As they were engaged in the ordinary occupations of
      life, their zeal and devotion were seldom animated by a sense of
      interest, or by the habits of an ecclesiastical character.
      Confined to their respective temples and cities, they remained
      without any connection of discipline or government; and whilst
      they acknowledged the supreme jurisdiction of the senate, of the
      college of pontiffs, and of the emperor, those civil magistrates
      contented themselves with the easy task of maintaining in peace
      and dignity the general worship of mankind. We have already seen
      how various, how loose, and how uncertain were the religious
      sentiments of Polytheists. They were abandoned, almost without
      control, to the natural workings of a superstitious fancy. The
      accidental circumstances of their life and situation determined
      the object as well as the degree of their devotion; and as long
      as their adoration was successively prostituted to a thousand
      deities, it was scarcely possible that their hearts could be
      susceptible of a very sincere or lively passion for any of them.

      priests of the Syrian goddess are very humorously described by

      151 (return) [ The office of Asiarch was of this nature, and it

      desire the honor; none but the most wealthy could support the
      expense. See, in the Patres Apostol. tom. ii. p. 200, with how
      much indifference Philip the Asiarch conducted himself in the
      martyrdom of Polycarp. There were likewise Bithyniarchs,
      Lyciarchs, &c.]

      When Christianity appeared in the world, even these faint and
      imperfect impressions had lost much of their original power.
      Human reason, which by its unassisted strength is incapable of
      perceiving the mysteries of faith, had already obtained an easy
      triumph over the folly of Paganism; and when Tertullian or
      Lactantius employ their labors in exposing its falsehood and
      extravagance, they are obliged to transcribe the eloquence of
      Cicero or the wit of Lucian. The contagion of these sceptical
      writings had been diffused far beyond the number of their
      readers. The fashion of incredulity was communicated from the
      philosopher to the man of pleasure or business, from the noble to
      the plebeian, and from the master to the menial slave who waited
      at his table, and who eagerly listened to the freedom of his
      conversation. On public occasions the philosophic part of mankind
      affected to treat with respect and decency the religious
      institutions of their country; but their secret contempt
      penetrated through the thin and awkward disguise; and even the
      people, when they discovered that their deities were rejected and
      derided by those whose rank or understanding they were accustomed
      to reverence, were filled with doubts and apprehensions
      concerning the truth of those doctrines, to which they had
      yielded the most implicit belief. The decline of ancient
      prejudice exposed a very numerous portion of human kind to the
      danger of a painful and comfortless situation. A state of
      scepticism and suspense may amuse a few inquisitive minds. But
      the practice of superstition is so congenial to the multitude,
      that if they are forcibly awakened, they still regret the loss of
      their pleasing vision. Their love of the marvellous and
      supernatural, their curiosity with regard to future events, and
      their strong propensity to extend their hopes and fears beyond
      the limits of the visible world, were the principal causes which
      favored the establishment of Polytheism. So urgent on the vulgar
      is the necessity of believing, that the fall of any system of
      mythology will most probably be succeeded by the introduction of
      some other mode of superstition. Some deities of a more recent
      and fashionable cast might soon have occupied the deserted
      temples of Jupiter and Apollo, if, in the decisive moment, the
      wisdom of Providence had not interposed a genuine revelation,
      fitted to inspire the most rational esteem and conviction,
      whilst, at the same time, it was adorned with all that could
      attract the curiosity, the wonder, and the veneration of the
      people. In their actual disposition, as many were almost
      disengaged from their artificial prejudices, but equally
      susceptible and desirous of a devout attachment; an object much
      less deserving would have been sufficient to fill the vacant
      place in their hearts, and to gratify the uncertain eagerness of
      their passions. Those who are inclined to pursue this reflection,
      instead of viewing with astonishment the rapid progress of
      Christianity, will perhaps be surprised that its success was not
      still more rapid and still more universal. It has been observed,
      with truth as well as propriety, that the conquests of Rome
      prepared and facilitated those of Christianity. In the second
      chapter of this work we have attempted to explain in what manner
      the most civilized provinces of Europe, Asia, and Africa were
      united under the dominion of one sovereign, and gradually
      connected by the most intimate ties of laws, of manners, and of
      language. The Jews of Palestine, who had fondly expected a
      temporal deliverer, gave so cold a reception to the miracles of
      the divine prophet, that it was found unnecessary to publish, or
      at least to preserve, any Hebrew gospel. 152 The authentic
      histories of the actions of Christ were composed in the Greek
      language, at a considerable distance from Jerusalem, and after
      the Gentile converts were grown extremely numerous. 153 As soon
      as those histories were translated into the Latin tongue, they
      were perfectly intelligible to all the subjects of Rome,
      excepting only to the peasants of Syria and Egypt, for whose
      benefit particular versions were afterwards made. The public
      highways, which had been constructed for the use of the legions,
      opened an easy passage for the Christian missionaries from
      Damascus to Corinth, and from Italy to the extremity of Spain or
      Britain; nor did those spiritual conquerors encounter any of the
      obstacles which usually retard or prevent the introduction of a
      foreign religion into a distant country. There is the strongest
      reason to believe, that before the reigns of Diocletian and
      Constantine, the faith of Christ had been preached in every
      province, and in all the great cities of the empire; but the
      foundation of the several congregations, the numbers of the
      faithful who composed them, and their proportion to the
      unbelieving multitude, are now buried in obscurity, or disguised
      by fiction and declamation. Such imperfect circumstances,
      however, as have reached our knowledge concerning the increase of
      the Christian name in Asia and Greece, in Egypt, in Italy, and in
      the West, we shall now proceed to relate, without neglecting the
      real or imaginary acquisitions which lay beyond the frontiers of
      the Roman empire.

      152 (return) [ The modern critics are not disposed to believe
      what the fathers almost unanimously assert, that St. Matthew
      composed a Hebrew gospel, of which only the Greek translation is
      extant. It seems, however, dangerous to reject their testimony. *
      Note: Strong reasons appear to confirm this testimony. Papias,
      contemporary of the Apostle St. John, says positively that
      Matthew had written the discourses of Jesus Christ in Hebrew, and
      that each interpreted them as he could. This Hebrew was the
      Syro-Chaldaic dialect, then in use at Jerusalem: Origen, Irenæus,
      Eusebius, Jerome, Epiphanius, confirm this statement. Jesus
      Christ preached himself in Syro-Chaldaic, as is proved by many
      words which he used, and which the Evangelists have taken the
      pains to translate. St. Paul, addressing the Jews, used the same
      language: Acts xxi. 40, xxii. 2, xxvi. 14. The opinions of some
      critics prove nothing against such undeniable testimonies.
      Moreover, their principal objection is, that St. Matthew quotes
      the Old Testament according to the Greek version of the LXX.,
      which is inaccurate; for of ten quotations, found in his Gospel,
      seven are evidently taken from the Hebrew text; the threo others
      offer little that differ: moreover, the latter are not literal
      quotations. St. Jerome says positively, that, according to a copy
      which he had seen in the library of Cæsarea, the quotations were
      made in Hebrew (in Catal.) More modern critics, among others
      Michaelis, do not entertain a doubt on the subject. The Greek
      version appears to have been made in the time of the apostles, as
      St. Jerome and St. Augustus affirm, perhaps by one of them.—G.

      Chapter XV: Progress Of The Christian Religion.—Part VIII.

      The rich provinces that extend from the Euphrates to the Ionian
      Sea were the principal theatre on which the apostle of the
      Gentiles displayed his zeal and piety. The seeds of the gospel,
      which he had scattered in a fertile soil, were diligently
      cultivated by his disciples; and it should seem that, during the
      two first centuries, the most considerable body of Christians was
      contained within those limits. Among the societies which were
      instituted in Syria, none were more ancient or more illustrious
      than those of Damascus, of Berea or Aleppo, and of Antioch. The
      prophetic introduction of the Apocalypse has described and
      immortalized the seven churches of Asia; Ephesus, Smyrna,
      Pergamus, Thyatira, 154 Sardes, Laodicea, and Philadelphia; and
      their colonies were soon diffused over that populous country. In
      a very early period, the islands of Cyprus and Crete, the
      provinces of Thrace and Macedonia, gave a favorable reception to
      the new religion; and Christian republics were soon founded in
      the cities of Corinth, of Sparta, and of Athens. 155 The
      antiquity of the Greek and Asiatic churches allowed a sufficient
      space of time for their increase and multiplication; and even the
      swarms of Gnostics and other heretics serve to display the
      flourishing condition of the orthodox church, since the
      appellation of heretics has always been applied to the less
      numerous party. To these domestic testimonies we may add the
      confession, the complaints, and the apprehensions of the Gentiles
      themselves. From the writings of Lucian, a philosopher who had
      studied mankind, and who describes their manners in the most
      lively colors, we may learn that, under the reign of Commodus,
      his native country of Pontus was filled with Epicureans and
      _Christians_. 156 Within fourscore years after the death of
      Christ, 157 the humane Pliny laments the magnitude of the evil
      which he vainly attempted to eradicate. In his very curious
      epistle to the emperor Trajan, he affirms that the temples were
      almost deserted, that the sacred victims scarcely found any
      purchasers, and that the superstition had not only infected the
      cities, but had even spread itself into the villages and the open
      country of Pontus and Bithynia. 158

      154 (return) [ The Alogians (Epiphanius de Hæres. 51) disputed
      the genuineness of the Apocalypse, because the church of Thyatira
      was not yet founded. Epiphanius, who allows the fact, extricates
      himself from the difficulty by ingeniously supposing that St.
      John wrote in the spirit of prophecy. See Abauzit, Discours sur
      l’Apocalypse.]

      155 (return) [ The epistles of Ignatius and Dionysius (ap. Euseb.
      iv. 23) point out many churches in Asia and Greece. That of
      Athens seems to have been one of the least flourishing.]

      156 (return) [ Lucian in Alexandro, c. 25. Christianity however,
      must have been very unequally diffused over Pontus; since, in the
      middle of the third century, there was no more than seventeen
      believers in the extensive diocese of Neo-Cæsarea. See M. de
      Tillemont, Memoires Ecclesiast. tom. iv. p. 675, from Basil and
      Gregory of Nyssa, who were themselves natives of Cappadocia.
      Note: Gibbon forgot the conclusion of this story, that Gregory
      left only seventeen heathens in his diocese. The antithesis is
      suspicious, and both numbers may have been chosen to magnify the
      spiritual fame of the wonder-worker.—M.]

      Without descending into a minute scrutiny of the expressions or
      of the motives of those writers who either celebrate or lament
      the progress of Christianity in the East, it may in general be
      observed that none of them have left us any grounds from whence a
      just estimate might be formed of the real numbers of the faithful
      in those provinces. One circumstance, however, has been
      fortunately preserved, which seems to cast a more distinct light
      on this obscure but interesting subject. Under the reign of
      Theodosius, after Christianity had enjoyed, during more than
      sixty years, the sunshine of Imperial favor, the ancient and
      illustrious church of Antioch consisted of one hundred thousand
      persons, three thousand of whom were supported out of the public
      oblations. 159 The splendor and dignity of the queen of the East,
      the acknowledged populousness of Cæsarea, Seleucia, and
      Alexandria, and the destruction of two hundred and fifty thousand
      souls in the earthquake which afflicted Antioch under the elder
      Justin, 160 are so many convincing proofs that the whole number
      of its inhabitants was not less than half a million, and that the
      Christians, however multiplied by zeal and power, did not exceed
      a fifth part of that great city. How different a proportion must
      we adopt when we compare the persecuted with the triumphant
      church, the West with the East, remote villages with populous
      towns, and countries recently converted to the faith with the
      place where the believers first received the appellation of
      Christians! It must not, however, be dissembled, that, in another
      passage, Chrysostom, to whom we are indebted for this useful
      information, computes the multitude of the faithful as even
      superior to that of the Jews and Pagans. 161 But the solution of
      this apparent difficulty is easy and obvious. The eloquent
      preacher draws a parallel between the civil and the
      ecclesiastical constitution of Antioch; between the list of
      Christians who had acquired heaven by baptism, and the list of
      citizens who had a right to share the public liberality. Slaves,
      strangers, and infants were comprised in the former; they were
      excluded from the latter.

      * Note: The statements of Chrysostom with regard to the
      population of Antioch, whatever may be their accuracy, are
      perfectly consistent. In one passage he reckons the population at
      200,000. In a second the Christians at 100,000. In a third he
      states that the Christians formed more than half the population.

      by estimate of the population of Antioch from other sources. The
      8000 maintained by alms were widows and virgins alone—M.]

      The extensive commerce of Alexandria, and its proximity to
      Palestine, gave an easy entrance to the new religion. It was at
      first embraced by great numbers of the Theraputæ, or Essenians,
      of the Lake Mareotis, a Jewish sect which had abated much of its
      reverence for the Mosaic ceremonies. The austere life of the
      Essenians, their fasts and excommunications, the community of
      goods, the love of celibacy, their zeal for martyrdom, and the
      warmth though not the purity of their faith, already offered a
      very lively image of the primitive discipline. 162 It was in the
      school of Alexandria that the Christian theology appears to have
      assumed a regular and scientific form; and when Hadrian visited
      Egypt, he found a church composed of Jews and of Greeks,
      sufficiently important to attract the notice of that inquisitive
      prince. 163 But the progress of Christianity was for a long time
      confined within the limits of a single city, which was itself a
      foreign colony, and till the close of the second century the
      predecessors of Demetrius were the only prelates of the Egyptian
      church. Three bishops were consecrated by the hands of Demetrius,
      and the number was increased to twenty by his successor Heraclas.
      164 The body of the natives, a people distinguished by a sullen
      inflexibility of temper, 165 entertained the new doctrine with
      coldness and reluctance; and even in the time of Origen, it was
      rare to meet with an Egyptian who had surmounted his early
      prejudices in favor of the sacred animals of his country. 166 As
      soon, indeed, as Christianity ascended the throne, the zeal of
      those barbarians obeyed the prevailing impulsion; the cities of
      Egypt were filled with bishops, and the deserts of Thebais
      swarmed with hermits.

      that it was composed as early as the time of Augustus, Basnage
      has demonstrated, in spite of Eusebius (l. ii. c. 17) and a crowd
      of modern Catholics, that the Therapeutæ were neither Christians
      nor monks. It still remains probable that they changed their
      name, preserved their manners, adopted some new articles of
      faith, and gradually became the fathers of the Egyptian
      Ascetics.]

      and its internal evidence would alone be a sufficient answer to
      all the objections which Bishop Pearson has urged in the Vindiciæ
      Ignatianæ.]

      A perpetual stream of strangers and provincials flowed into the
      capacious bosom of Rome. Whatever was strange or odious, whoever
      was guilty or suspected, might hope, in the obscurity of that
      immense capital, to elude the vigilance of the law. In such a
      various conflux of nations, every teacher, either of truth or
      falsehood, every founder, whether of a virtuous or a criminal
      association, might easily multiply his disciples or accomplices.
      The Christians of Rome, at the time of the accidental persecution
      of Nero, are represented by Tacitus as already amounting to a
      very great multitude, 167 and the language of that great
      historian is almost similar to the style employed by Livy, when
      he relates the introduction and the suppression of the rites of
      Bacchus. After the Bacchanals had awakened the severity of the
      senate, it was likewise apprehended that a very great multitude,
      as it were _another people_, had been initiated into those
      abhorred mysteries. A more careful inquiry soon demonstrated that
      the offenders did not exceed seven thousand; a number indeed
      sufficiently alarming, when considered as the object of public
      justice. 168 It is with the same candid allowance that we should
      interpret the vague expressions of Tacitus, and in a former
      instance of Pliny, when they exaggerate the crowds of deluded
      fanatics who had forsaken the established worship of the gods.
      The church of Rome was undoubtedly the first and most populous of
      the empire; and we are possessed of an authentic record which
      attests the state of religion in that city about the middle of
      the third century, and after a peace of thirty-eight years. The
      clergy, at that time, consisted of a bishop, forty-six
      presbyters, seven deacons, as many sub-deacons, forty-two
      acolytes, and fifty readers, exorcists, and porters. The number
      of widows, of the infirm, and of the poor, who were maintained by
      the oblations of the faithful, amounted to fifteen hundred. 169
      From reason, as well as from the analogy of Antioch, we may
      venture to estimate the Christians of Rome at about fifty
      thousand. The populousness of that great capital cannot perhaps
      be exactly ascertained; but the most modest calculation will not
      surely reduce it lower than a million of inhabitants, of whom the
      Christians might constitute at the most a twentieth part. 170

      perhaps exaggerated, by Livy.]

      169 (return) [ Eusebius, l. vi. c. 43. The Latin translator (M.
      de Valois) has thought proper to reduce the number of presbyters
      to forty-four.]

      170 (return) [ This proportion of the presbyters and of the poor,
      to the rest of the people, was originally fixed by Burnet,
      (Travels into Italy, p. 168,) and is approved by Moyle, (vol. ii.
      p. 151.) They were both unacquainted with the passage of
      Chrysostom, which converts their conjecture almost into a fact.]

      The western provincials appeared to have derived the knowledge of
      Christianity from the same source which had diffused among them
      the language, the sentiments, and the manners of Rome.

      In this more important circumstance, Africa, as well as Gaul was
      gradually fashioned to the imitation of the capital. Yet
      notwithstanding the many favorable occasions which might invite
      the Roman missionaries to visit their Latin provinces, it was
      late before they passed either the sea or the Alps; 171 nor can
      we discover in those great countries any assured traces either of
      faith or of persecution that ascend higher than the reign of the
      Antonines. 172 The slow progress of the gospel in the cold
      climate of Gaul, was extremely different from the eagerness with
      which it seems to have been received on the burning sands of
      Africa. The African Christians soon formed one of the principal
      members of the primitive church. The practice introduced into
      that province of appointing bishops to the most inconsiderable
      towns, and very frequently to the most obscure villages,
      contributed to multiply the splendor and importance of their
      religious societies, which during the course of the third century
      were animated by the zeal of Tertullian, directed by the
      abilities of Cyprian, and adorned by the eloquence of Lactantius.

      But if, on the contrary, we turn our eyes towards Gaul, we must
      content ourselves with discovering, in the time of Marcus
      Antoninus, the feeble and united congregations of Lyons and
      Vienna; and even as late as the reign of Decius we are assured,
      that in a few cities only, Arles, Narbonne, Thoulouse, Limoges,
      Clermont, Tours, and Paris, some scattered churches were
      supported by the devotion of a small number of Christians. 173
      Silence is indeed very consistent with devotion; but as it is
      seldom compatible with zeal, we may perceive and lament the
      languid state of Christianity in those provinces which had
      exchanged the Celtic for the Latin tongue, since they did not,
      during the three first centuries, give birth to a single
      ecclesiastical writer. From Gaul, which claimed a just
      preeminence of learning and authority over all the countries on
      this side of the Alps, the light of the gospel was more faintly
      reflected on the remote provinces of Spain and Britain; and if we
      may credit the vehement assertions of Tertullian, they had
      already received the first rays of the faith, when he addressed
      his apology to the magistrates of the emperor Severus. 174 But
      the obscure and imperfect origin of the western churches of
      Europe has been so negligently recorded, that if we would relate
      the time and manner of their foundation, we must supply the
      silence of antiquity by those legends which avarice or
      superstition long afterwards dictated to the monks in the lazy
      gloom of their convents. 175 Of these holy romances, that of the
      apostle St. James can alone, by its singular extravagance,
      deserve to be mentioned. From a peaceful fisherman of the Lake of
      Gennesareth, he was transformed into a valorous knight, who
      charged at the head of the Spanish chivalry in their battles
      against the Moors. The gravest historians have celebrated his
      exploits; the miraculous shrine of Compostella displayed his
      power; and the sword of a military order, assisted by the terrors
      of the Inquisition, was sufficient to remove every objection of
      profane criticism. 176

      Livy, and the honest detection of the legend of St. James by Dr.
      Geddes, Miscellanies, vol. ii. p. 221.]

      The progress of Christianity was not confined to the Roman
      empire; and according to the primitive fathers, who interpret
      facts by prophecy, the new religion, within a century after the
      death of its divine Author, had already visited every part of the
      globe. “There exists not,” says Justin Martyr, “a people, whether
      Greek or Barbarian, or any other race of men, by whatsoever
      appellation or manners they may be distinguished, however
      ignorant of arts or agriculture, whether they dwell under tents,
      or wander about in covered wagons, among whom prayers are not
      offered up in the name of a crucified Jesus to the Father and
      Creator of all things.” 177 But this splendid exaggeration, which
      even at present it would be extremely difficult to reconcile with
      the real state of mankind, can be considered only as the rash
      sally of a devout but careless writer, the measure of whose
      belief was regulated by that of his wishes. But neither the
      belief nor the wishes of the fathers can alter the truth of
      history. It will still remain an undoubted fact, that the
      barbarians of Scythia and Germany, who afterwards subverted the
      Roman monarchy, were involved in the darkness of paganism; and
      that even the conversion of Iberia, of Armenia, or of Æthiopia,
      was not attempted with any degree of success till the sceptre was
      in the hands of an orthodox emperor. 178 Before that time, the
      various accidents of war and commerce might indeed diffuse an
      imperfect knowledge of the gospel among the tribes of Caledonia,
      179 and among the borderers of the Rhine, the Danube, and the
      Euphrates. 180 Beyond the last-mentioned river, Edessa was
      distinguished by a firm and early adherence to the faith. 181
      From Edessa the principles of Christianity were easily introduced
      into the Greek and Syrian cities which obeyed the successors of
      Artaxerxes; but they do not appear to have made any deep
      impression on the minds of the Persians, whose religious system,
      by the labors of a well-disciplined order of priests, had been
      constructed with much more art and solidity than the uncertain
      mythology of Greece and Rome. 182

      Chapter XV: Progress Of The Christian Religion.—Part IX.

      From this impartial though imperfect survey of the progress of
      Christianity, it may perhaps seem probable, that the number of
      its proselytes has been excessively magnified by fear on the one
      side, and by devotion on the other. According to the
      irreproachable testimony of Origen, 183 the proportion of the
      faithful was very inconsiderable, when compared with the
      multitude of an unbelieving world; but, as we are left without
      any distinct information, it is impossible to determine, and it
      is difficult even to conjecture, the real numbers of the
      primitive Christians. The most favorable calculation, however,
      that can be deduced from the examples of Antioch and of Rome,
      will not permit us to imagine that more than a twentieth part of
      the subjects of the empire had enlisted themselves under the
      banner of the cross before the important conversion of
      Constantine. But their habits of faith, of zeal, and of union,
      seemed to multiply their numbers; and the same causes which
      contributed to their future increase, served to render their
      actual strength more apparent and more formidable.

      Such is the constitution of civil society, that, whilst a few
      persons are distinguished by riches, by honors, and by knowledge,
      the body of the people is condemned to obscurity, ignorance and
      poverty. The Christian religion, which addressed itself to the
      whole human race, must consequently collect a far greater number
      of proselytes from the lower than from the superior ranks of
      life. This innocent and natural circumstance has been improved
      into a very odious imputation, which seems to be less strenuously
      denied by the apologists, than it is urged by the adversaries, of
      the faith; that the new sect of Christians was almost entirely
      composed of the dregs of the populace, of peasants and mechanics,
      of boys and women, of beggars and slaves, the last of whom might
      sometimes introduce the missionaries into the rich and noble
      families to which they belonged. These obscure teachers (such was
      the charge of malice and infidelity) are as mute in public as
      they are loquacious and dogmatical in private. Whilst they
      cautiously avoid the dangerous encounter of philosophers, they
      mingle with the rude and illiterate crowd, and insinuate
      themselves into those minds whom their age, their sex, or their
      education, has the best disposed to receive the impression of
      superstitious terrors. 184

      This unfavorable picture, though not devoid of a faint
      resemblance, betrays, by its dark coloring and distorted
      features, the pencil of an enemy. As the humble faith of Christ
      diffused itself through the world, it was embraced by several
      persons who derived some consequence from the advantages of
      nature or fortune. Aristides, who presented an eloquent apology
      to the emperor Hadrian, was an Athenian philosopher. 185 Justin
      Martyr had sought divine knowledge in the schools of Zeno, of
      Aristotle, of Pythagoras, and of Plato, before he fortunately was
      accosted by the old man, or rather the angel, who turned his
      attention to the study of the Jewish prophets. 186 Clemens of
      Alexandria had acquired much various reading in the Greek, and
      Tertullian in the Latin, language. Julius Africanus and Origen
      possessed a very considerable share of the learning of their
      times; and although the style of Cyprian is very different from
      that of Lactantius, we might almost discover that both those
      writers had been public teachers of rhetoric. Even the study of
      philosophy was at length introduced among the Christians, but it
      was not always productive of the most salutary effects; knowledge
      was as often the parent of heresy as of devotion, and the
      description which was designed for the followers of Artemon, may,
      with equal propriety, be applied to the various sects that
      resisted the successors of the apostles. “They presume to alter
      the Holy Scriptures, to abandon the ancient rule of faith, and to
      form their opinions according to the subtile precepts of logic.
      The science of the church is neglected for the study of geometry,
      and they lose sight of heaven while they are employed in
      measuring the earth. Euclid is perpetually in their hands.
      Aristotle and Theophrastus are the objects of their admiration;
      and they express an uncommon reverence for the works of Galen.
      Their errors are derived from the abuse of the arts and sciences
      of the infidels, and they corrupt the simplicity of the gospel by
      the refinements of human reason.” 187

      187 (return) [ Eusebius, v. 28. It may be hoped, that none,
      except the heretics, gave occasion to the complaint of Celsus,
      (ap. Origen, l. ii. p. 77,) that the Christians were perpetually
      correcting and altering their Gospels. * Note: Origen states in
      reply, that he knows of none who had altered the Gospels except
      the Marcionites, the Valentinians, and perhaps some followers of
      Lucanus.—M.]

      Nor can it be affirmed with truth, that the advantages of birth
      and fortune were always separated from the profession of
      Christianity. Several Roman citizens were brought before the
      tribunal of Pliny, and he soon discovered, that a great number of
      persons of _every order_ of men in Bithynia had deserted the
      religion of their ancestors. 188 His unsuspected testimony may,
      in this instance, obtain more credit than the bold challenge of
      Tertullian, when he addresses himself to the fears as well as the
      humanity of the proconsul of Africa, by assuring him, that if he
      persists in his cruel intentions, he must decimate Carthage, and
      that he will find among the guilty many persons of his own rank,
      senators and matrons of noblest extraction, and the friends or
      relations of his most intimate friends. 189 It appears, however,
      that about forty years afterwards the emperor Valerian was
      persuaded of the truth of this assertion, since in one of his
      rescripts he evidently supposes that senators, Roman knights, and
      ladies of quality, were engaged in the Christian sect. 190 The
      church still continued to increase its outward splendor as it
      lost its internal purity; and, in the reign of Diocletian, the
      palace, the courts of justice, and even the army, concealed a
      multitude of Christians, who endeavored to reconcile the
      interests of the present with those of a future life.

      And yet these exceptions are either too few in number, or too
      recent in time, entirely to remove the imputation of ignorance
      and obscurity which has been so arrogantly cast on the first
      proselytes of Christianity. 1901 Instead of employing in our
      defence the fictions of later ages, it will be more prudent to
      convert the occasion of scandal into a subject of edification.
      Our serious thoughts will suggest to us, that the apostles
      themselves were chosen by Providence among the fishermen of
      Galilee, and that the lower we depress the temporal condition of
      the first Christians, the more reason we shall find to admire
      their merit and success. It is incumbent on us diligently to
      remember, that the kingdom of heaven was promised to the poor in
      spirit, and that minds afflicted by calamity and the contempt of
      mankind, cheerfully listen to the divine promise of future
      happiness; while, on the contrary, the fortunate are satisfied
      with the possession of this world; and the wise abuse in doubt
      and dispute their vain superiority of reason and knowledge.

      1901 (return) [ This incomplete enumeration ought to be increased
      by the names of several Pagans converted at the dawn of
      Christianity, and whose conversion weakens the reproach which the
      historian appears to support. Such are, the Proconsul Sergius
      Paulus, converted at Paphos, (Acts xiii. 7—12.) Dionysius, member
      of the Areopagus, converted with several others, al Athens, (Acts
      xvii. 34;) several persons at the court of Nero, (Philip. iv 22;)
      Erastus, receiver at Corinth, (Rom. xvi.23;) some Asiarchs, (Acts
      xix. 31) As to the philosophers, we may add Tatian, Athenagoras,
      Theophilus of Antioch, Hegesippus, Melito, Miltiades, Pantænus,
      Ammenius, all distinguished for their genius and learning.—G.]

      We stand in need of such reflections to comfort us for the loss
      of some illustrious characters, which in our eyes might have
      seemed the most worthy of the heavenly present. The names of
      Seneca, of the elder and the younger Pliny, of Tacitus, of
      Plutarch, of Galen, of the slave Epictetus, and of the emperor
      Marcus Antoninus, adorn the age in which they flourished, and
      exalt the dignity of human nature. They filled with glory their
      respective stations, either in active or contemplative life;
      their excellent understandings were improved by study; Philosophy
      had purified their minds from the prejudices of the popular
      superstitions; and their days were spent in the pursuit of truth
      and the practice of virtue. Yet all these sages (it is no less an
      object of surprise than of concern) overlooked or rejected the
      perfection of the Christian system. Their language or their
      silence equally discover their contempt for the growing sect,
      which in their time had diffused itself over the Roman empire.
      Those among them who condescended to mention the Christians,
      consider them only as obstinate and perverse enthusiasts, who
      exacted an implicit submission to their mysterious doctrines,
      without being able to produce a single argument that could engage
      the attention of men of sense and learning. 191

      191 (return) [ Dr. Lardner, in his first and second volumes of
      Jewish and Christian testimonies, collects and illustrates those
      of Pliny the younger, of Tacitus, of Galen, of Marcus Antoninus,
      and perhaps of Epictetus, (for it is doubtful whether that
      philosopher means to speak of the Christians.) The new sect is
      totally unnoticed by Seneca, the elder Pliny, and Plutarch.]

      It is at least doubtful whether any of these philosophers perused
      the apologies 1911 which the primitive Christians repeatedly
      published in behalf of themselves and of their religion; but it
      is much to be lamented that such a cause was not defended by
      abler advocates. They expose with superfluous wit and eloquence
      the extravagance of Polytheism. They interest our compassion by
      displaying the innocence and sufferings of their injured
      brethren. But when they would demonstrate the divine origin of
      Christianity, they insist much more strongly on the predictions
      which announced, than on the miracles which accompanied, the
      appearance of the Messiah. Their favorite argument might serve to
      edify a Christian or to convert a Jew, since both the one and the
      other acknowledge the authority of those prophecies, and both are
      obliged, with devout reverence, to search for their sense and
      their accomplishment. But this mode of persuasion loses much of
      its weight and influence, when it is addressed to those who
      neither understand nor respect the Mosaic dispensation and the
      prophetic style. 192 In the unskilful hands of Justin and of the
      succeeding apologists, the sublime meaning of the Hebrew oracles
      evaporates in distant types, affected conceits, and cold
      allegories; and even their authenticity was rendered suspicious
      to an unenlightened Gentile, by the mixture of pious forgeries,
      which, under the names of Orpheus, Hermes, and the Sibyls, 193
      were obtruded on him as of equal value with the genuine
      inspirations of Heaven. The adoption of fraud and sophistry in
      the defence of revelation too often reminds us of the injudicious
      conduct of those poets who load their _invulnerable_ heroes with
      a useless weight of cumbersome and brittle armor.

      1911 (return) [ The emperors Hadrian, Antoninus &c., read with
      astonishment the apologies of Justin Martyr, of Aristides, of
      Melito, &c. (See St. Hieron. ad mag. orat. Orosius, lviii. c.
      13.) Eusebius says expressly, that the cause of Christianity was
      defended before the senate, in a very elegant discourse, by
      Apollonius the Martyr.—G. ——Gibbon, in his severer spirit of
      criticism, may have questioned the authority of Jerome and
      Eusebius. There are some difficulties about Apollonius, which
      Heinichen (note in loc. Eusebii) would solve, by suppose lag him
      to have been, as Jerome states, a senator.—M.]

      192 (return) [ If the famous prophecy of the Seventy Weeks had
      been alleged to a Roman philosopher, would he not have replied in

      Observe with what irreverence Lucian, (in Alexandro, c. 13.) and
      his friend Celsus ap. Origen, (l. vii. p. 327,) express
      themselves concerning the Hebrew prophets.]

      193 (return) [ The philosophers who derided the more ancient
      predictions of the Sibyls, would easily have detected the Jewish
      and Christian forgeries, which have been so triumphantly quoted
      by the fathers, from Justin Martyr to Lactantius. When the
      Sibylline verses had performed their appointed task, they, like
      the system of the millennium, were quietly laid aside. The
      Christian Sybil had unluckily fixed the ruin of Rome for the year
      195, A. U. C. 948.]

      But how shall we excuse the supine inattention of the Pagan and
      philosophic world, to those evidences which were represented by
      the hand of Omnipotence, not to their reason, but to their
      senses? During the age of Christ, of his apostles, and of their
      first disciples, the doctrine which they preached was confirmed
      by innumerable prodigies. The lame walked, the blind saw, the
      sick were healed, the dead were raised, dæmons were expelled, and
      the laws of Nature were frequently suspended for the benefit of
      the church. But the sages of Greece and Rome turned aside from
      the awful spectacle, and, pursuing the ordinary occupations of
      life and study, appeared unconscious of any alterations in the
      moral or physical government of the world. Under the reign of
      Tiberius, the whole earth, 194 or at least a celebrated province
      of the Roman empire, 195 was involved in a preternatural darkness
      of three hours. Even this miraculous event, which ought to have
      excited the wonder, the curiosity, and the devotion of mankind,
      passed without notice in an age of science and history. 196 It
      happened during the lifetime of Seneca and the elder Pliny, who
      must have experienced the immediate effects, or received the
      earliest intelligence, of the prodigy. Each of these
      philosophers, in a laborious work, has recorded all the great
      phenomena of Nature, earthquakes, meteors, comets, and eclipses,
      which his indefatigable curiosity could collect. 197 Both the one
      and the other have omitted to mention the greatest phenomenon to
      which the mortal eye has been witness since the creation of the
      globe. A distinct chapter of Pliny 198 is designed for eclipses
      of an extraordinary nature and unusual duration; but he contents
      himself with describing the singular defect of light which
      followed the murder of Cæsar, when, during the greatest part of a
      year, the orb of the sun appeared pale and without splendor. The
      season of obscurity, which cannot surely be compared with the
      preternatural darkness of the Passion, had been already
      celebrated by most of the poets 199 and historians of that
      memorable age. 200

      by Dom Calmet, (Dissertations sur la Bible, tom. iii. p.

      they are followed by most of the moderns.]

      196 (return) [ The celebrated passage of Phlegon is now wisely
      abandoned. When Tertullian assures the Pagans that the mention of
      the prodigy is found in Arcanis (not Archivis) vestris, (see his
      Apology, c. 21,) he probably appeals to the Sibylline verses,
      which relate it exactly in the words of the Gospel. * Note:
      According to some learned theologians a misunderstanding of the
      text in the Gospel has given rise to this mistake, which has
      employed and wearied so many laborious commentators, though
      Origen had already taken the pains to preinform them. The
      expression does not mean, they assert, an eclipse, but any kind
      of obscurity occasioned in the atmosphere, whether by clouds or
      any other cause. As this obscuration of the sun rarely took place
      in Palestine, where in the middle of April the sky was usually
      clear, it assumed, in the eyes of the Jews and Christians, an
      importance conformable to the received notion, that the sun
      concealed at midday was a sinister presage. See Amos viii. 9, 10.
      The word is often taken in this sense by contemporary writers;
      the Apocalypse says the sun was concealed, when speaking of an
      obscuration caused by smoke and dust. (Revel. ix. 2.) Moreover,
      the Hebrew word ophal, which in the LXX. answers to the Greek,
      signifies any darkness; and the Evangelists, who have modelled
      the sense of their expressions by those of the LXX., must have
      taken it in the same latitude. This darkening of the sky usually
      precedes earthquakes. (Matt. xxvii. 51.) The Heathen authors
      furnish us a number of examples, of which a miraculous
      explanation was given at the time. See Ovid. ii. v. 33, l. xv. v.
      785. Pliny, Hist. Nat. l. ii. c 30. Wetstein has collected all
      these examples in his edition of the New Testament. We need not,
      then, be astonished at the silence of the Pagan authors
      concerning a phenomenon which did not extend beyond Jerusalem,
      and which might have nothing contrary to the laws of nature;
      although the Christians and the Jews may have regarded it as a
      sinister presage. See Michaelis Notes on New Testament, v. i. p.
