<a id='line_28'>INTRODUCTION</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'></a>
<a id='line_31'>WHILST engaged on the Translations contained in these volumes, and on the</a>
<a id='line_32'>Notes appended to the various Tales, I have found myself led unavoidably</a>
<a id='line_33'>into a much more extensive course of reading than I had originally</a>
<a id='line_34'>contemplated, and one which in great measure bears directly upon the</a>
<a id='line_35'>earlier Mediæval Romance.</a>
<a id='line_36'></a>
<a id='line_37'>Before commencing these labours, I was aware, generally, that there</a>
<a id='line_38'>existed a connexion between the Welsh Mabinogion and the Romance of the</a>
<a id='line_39'>Continent; but as I advanced, I became better acquainted with the</a>
<a id='line_40'>closeness and extent of that connexion, its history, and the proofs by</a>
<a id='line_41'>which it is supported.</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>At the same time, indeed, I became aware, and still strongly feel, that</a>
<a id='line_44'>it is one thing to collect facts, and quite another to classify and draw</a>
<a id='line_45'>from them their legitimate conclusions; and though I am loth that what</a>
<a id='line_46'>has been collected with some pains, should be entirely thrown away, it is</a>
<a id='line_47'>unwillingly, and with diffidence, that I trespass beyond the acknowledged</a>
<a id='line_48'>province of a translator.</a>
<a id='line_49'></a>
<a id='line_50'>In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries there arose into general</a>
<a id='line_51'>notoriety in Europe, a body of “Romance,” which in various forms retained</a>
<a id='line_52'>its popularity till the Reformation.  In it the plot, the incidents, the</a>
<a id='line_53'>characters, were almost wholly those of Chivalry, that bond which united</a>
<a id='line_54'>the warriors of France, Spain, and Italy, with those of pure Teutonic</a>
<a id='line_55'>descent, and embraced more or less firmly all the nations of Europe,</a>
<a id='line_56'>excepting only the Slavonic races, not yet risen to power, and the Celts,</a>
<a id='line_57'>who had fallen from it.  It is not difficult to account for this latter</a>
<a id='line_58'>omission.  The Celts, driven from the plains into the mountains and</a>
<a id='line_59'>islands, preserved their liberty, and hated their oppressors with fierce,</a>
<a id='line_60'>and not causeless, hatred.  A proud and free people, isolated both in</a>
<a id='line_61'>country and language, were not likely to adopt customs which implied</a>
<a id='line_62'>brotherhood with their foes.</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>Such being the case, it is remarkable that when the chief romances are</a>
<a id='line_65'>examined, the name of many of the heroes and their scenes of action are</a>
<a id='line_66'>found to be Celtic, and those of persons and places famous in the</a>
<a id='line_67'>traditions of Wales and Brittany.  Of this the romances of Ywaine and</a>
<a id='line_68'>Gawaine, Sir Perceval de Galles, Eric and Enide, Mort d’Arthur, Sir</a>
<a id='line_69'>Lancelot, Sir Tristan, the Graal, &c., may be cited as examples.  In some</a>
<a id='line_70'>cases a tendency to triads, and other matters of internal evidence, point</a>
<a id='line_71'>in the same direction.</a>
<a id='line_72'></a>
<a id='line_73'>It may seem difficult to account for this.  Although the ancient dominion</a>
<a id='line_74'>of the Celts over Europe is not without enduring evidence in the names of</a>
<a id='line_75'>the mountains and streams, the great features of a country, yet the loss</a>
<a id='line_76'>of their prior language by the great mass of the Celtic nations in</a>
<a id='line_77'>Southern Europe (if indeed their successors in territory be at all of</a>
<a id='line_78'>their blood), prevents us from clearly seeing, and makes us wonder, how</a>
<a id='line_79'>stories, originally embodied in the Celtic dialects of Great Britain and</a>
<a id='line_80'>France, could so influence the literature of nations to whom the Celtic</a>
<a id='line_81'>languages were utterly unknown.  Whence then came these internal marks,</a>
<a id='line_82'>and these proper names of persons and places, the features of a story</a>
<a id='line_83'>usually of earliest date and least likely to change?</a>
<a id='line_84'></a>
<a id='line_85'>These romances were found in England, France, Germany, Norway, Sweden,</a>
<a id='line_86'>and even Iceland, as early as the beginning of the thirteenth and end of</a>
<a id='line_87'>the twelfth century.  The Germans, who propagated them through the</a>
<a id='line_88'>nations of the North, derived them certainly from France.  Robert Wace</a>
<a id='line_89'>published his Anglo-Norman Romance of the Brut d’Angleterre about 1155.</a>
<a id='line_90'>Sir Tristan was written in French prose in 1170; and The Chevalier au</a>
<a id='line_91'>Lion, Chevalier de l’Epée, and Sir Lancelot du Lac, in metrical French,</a>
<a id='line_92'>by Chrestien de Troyes, before 1200.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>From these facts it is to be argued that the further back these romances</a>
<a id='line_95'>are traced, the more clearly does it appear that they spread over the</a>
<a id='line_96'>Continent from the North-west of France.  The older versions, it may be</a>
<a id='line_97'>remarked, are far more simple than the later corruptions.  In them there</a>
<a id='line_98'>is less allusion to the habits and usages of Chivalry, and the Welsh</a>
<a id='line_99'>names and elements stand out in stronger relief.  It is a great step to</a>
<a id='line_100'>be able to trace the stocks of these romances back to Wace, or to his</a>
<a id='line_101'>country and age.  For Wace’s work was not original.  He himself, a native</a>
<a id='line_102'>of Jersey, appears to have derived much of it from the “Historia</a>
<a id='line_103'>Britonum” of Gruffydd ab Arthur, commonly known as “Geoffrey of</a>
<a id='line_104'>Monmouth,” born 1128, who himself professes to have translated from a</a>
<a id='line_105'>British original.  It is, however, very possible that Wace may have had</a>
<a id='line_106'>access, like Geoffrey, to independent sources of information.</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'>To the claims set up on behalf of Wace and Geoffrey, to be regarded as</a>
<a id='line_109'>the channels by which the Cymric tales passed into the Continental</a>
<a id='line_110'>Romance, may be added those of a third almost contemporary author.</a>
<a id='line_111'>Layamon, a Saxon priest, dwelling, about 1200, upon the banks of the</a>
<a id='line_112'>upper Severn, acknowledges for the source of his British history, the</a>
<a id='line_113'>_English_ Bede, the _Latin_ Albin, and the _French_ Wace.  The last-named</a>
<a id='line_114'>however is by very much his chief, and, for Welsh matters, his only</a>
<a id='line_115'>avowed authority.  His book, nevertheless, contains a number of names and</a>
<a id='line_116'>stories relating to Wales, of which no traces appear in Wace, or indeed</a>
<a id='line_117'>in Geoffrey, but which he was certainly in a very favourable position to</a>
<a id='line_118'>obtain for himself.  Layamon, therefore, not only confirms Geoffrey in</a>
<a id='line_119'>some points, but it is clear, that, professing to follow Wace, he had</a>
<a id='line_120'>independent access to the great body of Welsh literature then current.</a>
<a id='line_121'>Sir F. Madden has put this matter very clearly, in his recent edition of</a>
<a id='line_122'>Layamon.  The Abbé de la Rue, also, was of opinion that Gaimar, an</a>
<a id='line_123'>Anglo-Norman, in the reign of Stephen, usually regarded as a translator</a>
<a id='line_124'>of Geoffrey of Monmouth, had access to a Welsh independent authority.</a>
<a id='line_125'></a>
<a id='line_126'>In addition to these, is to be mentioned the English version of Sir</a>
<a id='line_127'>Tristrem, which Sir Walter Scott considered to be derived from a distinct</a>
<a id='line_128'>Celtic source, and not, like the later Amadis, Palmerin, and Lord</a>
<a id='line_129'>Berners’s Canon of Romance, imported into English literature by</a>
<a id='line_130'>translation from the French.  For the Auntours of Arthur, recently</a>
<a id='line_131'>published by the Camden Society, their Editor, Mr. Robson, seems to hint</a>
<a id='line_132'>at a similar claim.</a>
<a id='line_133'></a>
<a id='line_134'>Here then are various known channels, by which portions of Welsh and</a>
<a id='line_135'>Armoric fiction crossed the Celtic border, and gave rise to the more</a>
<a id='line_136'>ornate, and widely-spread romance of the Age of Chivalry.  It is not</a>
<a id='line_137'>improbable that there may have existed many others.  It appears then that</a>
<a id='line_138'>a large portion of the stocks of Mediæval Romance proceeded from Wales.</a>
<a id='line_139'>We have next to see in what condition they are still found in that</a>
<a id='line_140'>country.</a>
<a id='line_141'></a>
<a id='line_142'>That Wales possessed an ancient literature, containing various lyric</a>
<a id='line_143'>compositions, and certain triads, in which are arranged historical facts</a>
<a id='line_144'>or moral aphorisms, has been shown by Sharon Turner, who has established</a>
<a id='line_145'>the high antiquity of many of these compositions.</a>
<a id='line_146'></a>
<a id='line_147'>The more strictly Romantic Literature of Wales has been less fortunate,</a>
<a id='line_148'>though not less deserving of critical attention.  Small portions only of</a>
<a id='line_149'>it have hitherto appeared in print, the remainder being still hidden in</a>
<a id='line_150'>the obscurity of ancient Manuscripts: of these the chief is supposed to</a>
<a id='line_151'>be the Red Book of Hergest, now in the Library of Jesus College, Oxford,</a>
<a id='line_152'>and of the fourteenth century.  This contains, besides poems, the prose</a>
<a id='line_153'>romances known as Mabinogion.  The Black Book of Caermarthen, preserved</a>
<a id='line_154'>at Hengwrt, and considered not to be of later date than the twelfth</a>
<a id='line_155'>century, is said to contain poems only. {1}</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>The Mabinogion, however, though thus early recorded in the Welsh tongue,</a>
<a id='line_158'>are in their existing form by no means wholly Welsh.  They are of two</a>
<a id='line_159'>tolerably distinct classes.  Of these, the older contains few allusions</a>
<a id='line_160'>to Norman customs, manners, arts, arms, and luxuries.  The other, and</a>
<a id='line_161'>less ancient, are full of such allusions, and of ecclesiastical terms.</a>
<a id='line_162'>Both classes, no doubt, are equally of Welsh root, but the former are not</a>
<a id='line_163'>more overlaid or corrupted, than might have been expected, from the</a>
<a id='line_164'>communication that so early took place between the Normans and the Welsh;</a>
<a id='line_165'>whereas the latter probably migrated from Wales, and were brought back</a>
<a id='line_166'>and re-translated after an absence of centuries, with a load of Norman</a>
<a id='line_167'>additions.  Kilhwch and Olwen, and the dream of Rhonabwy, may be cited as</a>
<a id='line_168'>examples of the older and purer class; the Lady of the Fountain, Peredur,</a>
<a id='line_169'>and Geraint ab Erbin, of the later, or decorated.</a>
<a id='line_170'></a>
<a id='line_171'>Besides these, indeed, there are a few tales, as Amlyn and Amic, Sir</a>
<a id='line_172'>Bevis of Hamtoun, the Seven Wise Masters, and the story of Charlemagne,</a>
<a id='line_173'>so obviously of foreign extraction, and of late introduction into Wales,</a>
<a id='line_174'>not presenting even a Welsh name, or allusion, and of such very slender</a>
<a id='line_175'>intrinsic merit, that although comprised in the Llyvr Coch, they have not</a>
<a id='line_176'>a shadow of claim to form part of the Canon of Welsh Romance.  Therefore,</a>
<a id='line_177'>although I have translated and examined them, I have given them no place</a>
<a id='line_178'>in these volumes.</a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>There is one argument in favour of the high antiquity in Wales of many of</a>
<a id='line_181'>the Mabinogion, which deserves to be mentioned here.  This argument is</a>
<a id='line_182'>founded on the topography of the country.  It is found that Saxon names</a>
<a id='line_183'>of places are very frequently definitions of the nature of the locality</a>
<a id='line_184'>to which they are attached, as Clifton, Deepden, Bridge-ford, Thorpe,</a>
<a id='line_185'>Ham, Wick, and the like; whereas those of Wales are more frequently</a>
<a id='line_186'>commemorative of some event, real or supposed, said to have happened on</a>
<a id='line_187'>or near the spot, or bearing allusion to some person renowned in the</a>
<a id='line_188'>story of the country or district.  Such are “Llyn y Morwynion,” the Lake</a>
<a id='line_189'>of the Maidens; “Rhyd y Bedd,” the Ford of the Grave; “Bryn Cyfergyr,”</a>
<a id='line_190'>the Hill of Assault; and so on.  But as these names could not have</a>
<a id='line_191'>preceded the events to which they refer, the events themselves must be</a>
<a id='line_192'>not unfrequently as old as the early settlement in the country.  And as</a>
<a id='line_193'>some of these events and fictions are the subjects of, and are explained</a>
<a id='line_194'>by, existing Welsh legends, it follows that the legends must be, in some</a>
<a id='line_195'>shape or other, of very remote antiquity.  It will be observed that this</a>
<a id='line_196'>argument supports _remote_ antiquity only for such legends as are</a>
<a id='line_197'>connected with the greater topographical features, as mountains, lakes,</a>
<a id='line_198'>rivers, seas, which must have been named at an early period in the</a>
<a id='line_199'>inhabitation of the country by man.  But there exist, also, legends</a>
<a id='line_200'>connected with the lesser features, as pools, hills, detached rocks,</a>
<a id='line_201'>caves, fords, and the like, places not necessarily named by the earlier</a>
<a id='line_202'>settlers, but the names of which are, nevertheless, probably very old,</a>
<a id='line_203'>since the words of which they are composed are in many cases not retained</a>
<a id='line_204'>in the colloquial tongue, in which they must once have been included, and</a>
<a id='line_205'>are in some instances lost from the language altogether, so much so as to</a>
<a id='line_206'>be only partially explicable even by scholars.  The argument applies</a>
<a id='line_207'>likewise, in their degree, to camps, barrows, and other artificial</a>
<a id='line_208'>earth-works.</a>
<a id='line_209'></a>
<a id='line_210'>Conclusions thus drawn, when established, rest upon a very firm basis.</a>
<a id='line_211'>They depend upon the number and appositeness of the facts, and it would</a>
<a id='line_212'>be very interesting to pursue this branch of evidence in detail.  In</a>
<a id='line_213'>following up this idea, the names to be sought for might thus be</a>
<a id='line_214'>classed:—</a>
<a id='line_215'></a>
<a id='line_216'>I.  Names of the great features, involving proper names and actions.</a>
<a id='line_217'></a>
<a id='line_218'>Cadair Idris and Cadair Arthur both involve more than a mere name.  Idris</a>
<a id='line_219'>and Arthur must have been invested with heroic qualifications to have</a>
<a id='line_220'>been placed in such “seats.”</a>
<a id='line_221'></a>
<a id='line_222'>II.  Names of lesser features, as “Bryn y Saeth,” Hill of the Dart; “Llyn</a>
<a id='line_223'>Llyngclys,” Lake of the Engulphed Court; “Ceven y Bedd,” the Ridge of the</a>
<a id='line_224'>Grave; “Rhyd y Saeson,” the Saxons’ Ford.</a>
<a id='line_225'></a>
<a id='line_226'>III.  Names of mixed natural and artificial objects, as “Coeten Arthur,”</a>
<a id='line_227'>Arthur’s Coit; “Cerrig y Drudion,” the Crag of the Heroes; which involve</a>
<a id='line_228'>actions.  And such as embody proper names only, as “Cerrig Howell,” the</a>
<a id='line_229'>Crag of Howell; “Caer Arianrod,” the Camp of Arianrod; “Bron Goronwy,”</a>
<a id='line_230'>the Breast (of the Hill) of Goronwy; “Castell mab Wynion,” the Castle of</a>
<a id='line_231'>the son of Wynion; “Nant Gwrtheyrn,” the Rill of Vortigern.</a>
<a id='line_232'></a>
<a id='line_233'>The selection of names would demand much care and discretion.  The</a>
<a id='line_234'>translations should be indisputable, and, where known, the connexion of a</a>
<a id='line_235'>name with a legend should be noted.  Such a name as “Mochdrev,”</a>
<a id='line_236'>Swine-town, would be valueless unless accompanied by a legend.</a>
<a id='line_237'></a>
<a id='line_238'>It is always valuable to find a place or work called after an individual,</a>
<a id='line_239'>because it may help to support some tradition of his existence or his</a>
<a id='line_240'>actions.  But it is requisite that care be taken not to push the</a>
<a id='line_241'>etymological dissection too far.  Thus, “Caer Arianrod” should be taken</a>
<a id='line_242'>simply as the “Camp of Arianrod,” and not rendered the “Camp of the</a>
<a id='line_243'>silver circle,” because the latter, though it might possibly have</a>
<a id='line_244'>something to do with the reason for which the name was borne by Arianrod</a>
<a id='line_245'>herself, had clearly no reference to its application to her camp.</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'>It appears to me, then, looking back upon what has been advanced:—</a>
<a id='line_248'></a>
<a id='line_249'>I.  That we have throughout Europe, at an early period, a great body of</a>
<a id='line_250'>literature, known as Mediæval Romance, which, amidst much that is wholly</a>
<a id='line_251'>of Teutonic origin and character, includes certain well-marked traces of</a>
<a id='line_252'>an older Celtic nucleus.</a>
<a id='line_253'></a>
<a id='line_254'>II.  Proceeding backwards in time, we find these romances, their</a>
<a id='line_255'>ornaments falling away at each step, existing towards the twelfth</a>
<a id='line_256'>century, of simpler structure, and with less encumbered Celtic features,</a>
<a id='line_257'>in the works of Wace, and other Bards of the Langue d’Oil.</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>III.  We find that Geoffrey of Monmouth, Layamon, and other early British</a>
<a id='line_260'>and Anglo-Saxon historians, and minstrels, on the one hand, transmitted</a>
<a id='line_261'>to Europe the rudiments of its after romance, much of which, on the other</a>
<a id='line_262'>hand, they drew from Wales.</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>IV.  Crossing into Wales we find, in the Mabinogion, the evident</a>
<a id='line_265'>counterpart of the Celtic portion of the continental romance, mixed up,</a>
<a id='line_266'>indeed, with various reflex additions from beyond the border, but still</a>
<a id='line_267'>containing ample internal evidence of a Welsh original.</a>
<a id='line_268'></a>
<a id='line_269'>V.  Looking at the connexion between divers of the more ancient</a>
<a id='line_270'>Mabinogion, and the topographical nomenclature of part of the country, we</a>
<a id='line_271'>find evidence of the great, though indefinite, antiquity of these tales,</a>
<a id='line_272'>and of an origin, which, if not indigenous, is certainly derived from no</a>
<a id='line_273'>European nation.</a>
<a id='line_274'></a>
<a id='line_275'>It was with a general belief in some of these conclusions, that I</a>
<a id='line_276'>commenced my labours, and I end them with my impressions strongly</a>
<a id='line_277'>confirmed.  The subject is one not unworthy of the talents of a Llwyd or</a>
<a id='line_278'>a Prichard.  It might, I think, be shown, by pursuing the inquiry, that</a>
<a id='line_279'>the Cymric nation is not only, as Dr. Prichard has proved it to be, an</a>
<a id='line_280'>early offshoot of the Indo-European family, and a people of unmixed</a>
<a id='line_281'>descent, but that when driven out of their conquests by the later</a>
<a id='line_282'>nations, the names and exploits of their heroes, and the compositions of</a>
<a id='line_283'>their bards, spread far and wide among the invaders, and affected</a>
<a id='line_284'>intimately their tastes and literature for many centuries, and that it</a>
<a id='line_285'>has strong claims to be considered the cradle of European Romance.</a>
<a id='line_286'></a>

<a id='line_293'></a>
<a id='line_294'>THE LADY OF THE FOUNTAIN</a>
<a id='line_295'></a>
<a id='line_296'></a>
<a id='line_297'>KING ARTHUR was at Caerlleon upon Usk; and one day he sat in his chamber;</a>
<a id='line_298'>and with him were Owain the son of Urien, and Kynon the son of Clydno,</a>
<a id='line_299'>and Kai the son of Kyner; and Gwenhwyvar and her handmaidens at</a>
<a id='line_300'>needlework by the window.  And if it should be said that there was a</a>
<a id='line_301'>porter at Arthur’s palace, there was none.  Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr was</a>
<a id='line_302'>there, acting as porter, to welcome guests and strangers, and to receive</a>
<a id='line_303'>them with honour, and to inform them of the manners and customs of the</a>
<a id='line_304'>Court; and to direct those who came to the Hall or to the</a>
<a id='line_305'>presence-chamber, and those who came to take up their lodging.</a>
<a id='line_306'></a>
<a id='line_307'>In the centre of the chamber King Arthur sat upon a seat of green rushes,</a>
<a id='line_308'>over which was spread a covering of flame-coloured satin, and a cushion</a>
<a id='line_309'>of red satin was under his elbow.</a>
<a id='line_310'></a>
<a id='line_311'>Then Arthur spoke, “If I thought you would not disparage me,” said he, “I</a>
<a id='line_312'>would sleep while I wait for my repast; and you can entertain one another</a>
<a id='line_313'>with relating tales, and can obtain a flagon of mead and some meat from</a>
<a id='line_314'>Kai.”  And the King went to sleep.  And Kynon the son of Clydno asked Kai</a>
<a id='line_315'>for that which Arthur had promised them.  “I, too, will have the good</a>
<a id='line_316'>tale which he promised to me,” said Kai.  “Nay,” answered Kynon, “fairer</a>
<a id='line_317'>will it be for thee to fulfill Arthur’s behest, in the first place, and</a>
<a id='line_318'>then we will tell thee the best tale that we know.”  So Kai went to the</a>
<a id='line_319'>kitchen and to the mead-cellar, and returned bearing a flagon of mead and</a>
<a id='line_320'>a golden goblet, and a handful of skewers, upon which were broiled</a>
<a id='line_321'>collops of meat.  Then they ate the collops and began to drink the mead.</a>
<a id='line_322'>“Now,” said Kai, “it is time for you to give me my story.”  “Kynon,” said</a>
<a id='line_323'>Owain, “do thou pay to Kai the tale that is his due.”  “Truly,” said</a>
<a id='line_324'>Kynon, “thou are older, and art a better teller of tales, and hast seen</a>
<a id='line_325'>more marvellous things than I; do thou therefore pay Kai his tale.”</a>
<a id='line_326'>“Begin thyself,” quoth Owain, “with the best that thou knowest.”  “I will</a>
<a id='line_327'>do so,” answered Kynon.</a>
<a id='line_328'></a>
<a id='line_329'>“I was the only son of my mother and father, and I was exceedingly</a>
<a id='line_330'>aspiring, and my daring was very great.  I thought there was no</a>
<a id='line_331'>enterprise in the world too mighty for me, and after I had achieved all</a>
<a id='line_332'>the adventures that were in my own country, I equipped myself, and set</a>
<a id='line_333'>forth to journey through deserts and distant regions.  And at length it</a>
<a id='line_334'>chanced that I came to the fairest valley in the world, wherein were</a>
<a id='line_335'>trees of equal growth; and a river ran through the valley, and a path was</a>
<a id='line_336'>by the side of the river.  And I followed the path until mid-day, and</a>
<a id='line_337'>continued my journey along the remainder of the valley until the evening;</a>
<a id='line_338'>and at the extremity of a plain I came to a large and lustrous Castle, at</a>
<a id='line_339'>the foot of which was a torrent.  And I approached the Castle, and there</a>
<a id='line_340'>I beheld two youths with yellow curling hair, each with a frontlet of</a>
<a id='line_341'>gold upon his head, and clad in a garment of yellow satin, and they had</a>
<a id='line_342'>gold clasps upon their insteps.  In the hand of each of them was an ivory</a>
<a id='line_343'>bow, strung with the sinews of the stag; and their arrows had shafts of</a>
<a id='line_344'>the bone of the whale, and were winged with peacock’s feathers; the</a>
<a id='line_345'>shafts also had golden heads.  And they had daggers with blades of gold,</a>
<a id='line_346'>and with hilts of the bone of the whale.  And they were shooting their</a>
<a id='line_347'>daggers.</a>
<a id='line_348'></a>
<a id='line_349'>“And a little way from them I saw a man in the prime of life, with his</a>
<a id='line_350'>beard newly shorn, clad in a robe and a mantle of yellow satin; and round</a>
<a id='line_351'>the top of his mantle was a band of gold lace.  On his feet were shoes of</a>
<a id='line_352'>variegated leather, fastened by two bosses of gold.  When I saw him, I</a>
<a id='line_353'>went towards him and saluted him, and such was his courtesy that he no</a>
<a id='line_354'>sooner received my greeting than he returned it.  And he went with me</a>
<a id='line_355'>towards the Castle.  Now there were no dwellers in the Castle except</a>
<a id='line_356'>those who were in one hall.  And there I saw four-and-twenty damsels,</a>
<a id='line_357'>embroidering satin at a window.  And this I tell thee, Kai, that the</a>
<a id='line_358'>least fair of them was fairer than the fairest maid thou hast ever beheld</a>
<a id='line_359'>in the Island of Britain, and the least lovely of them was more lovely</a>
<a id='line_360'>than Gwenhwyvar, the wife of Arthur, when she has appeared loveliest at</a>
<a id='line_361'>the Offering, on the day of the Nativity, or at the feast of Easter.</a>
<a id='line_362'>They rose up at my coming, and six of them took my horse, and divested me</a>
<a id='line_363'>of my armour; and six others took my arms, and washed them in a vessel</a>
<a id='line_364'>until they were perfectly bright.  And the third six spread cloths upon</a>
<a id='line_365'>the tables and prepared meat.  And the fourth six took off my soiled</a>
<a id='line_366'>garments, and placed others upon me; namely, an under-vest and a doublet</a>
<a id='line_367'>of fine linen, and a robe, and a surcoat, and a mantle of yellow satin</a>
<a id='line_368'>with a broad gold band upon the mantle.  And they placed cushions both</a>
<a id='line_369'>beneath and around me, with coverings of red linen; and I sat down.  Now</a>
<a id='line_370'>the six maidens who had taken my horse, unharnessed him, as well as if</a>
<a id='line_371'>they had been the best squires in the Island of Britain.  Then, behold,</a>
<a id='line_372'>they brought bowls of silver wherein was water to wash, and towels of</a>
<a id='line_373'>linen, some green and some white; and I washed.  And in a little while</a>
<a id='line_374'>the man sat down to the table.  And I sat next to him, and below me sat</a>
<a id='line_375'>all the maidens, except those who waited on us.  And the table was of</a>
<a id='line_376'>silver, and the cloths upon the table were of linen; and no vessel was</a>
<a id='line_377'>served upon the table that was not either of gold or of silver, or of</a>
<a id='line_378'>buffalo-horn.  And our meat was brought to us.  And verily, Kai, I saw</a>
<a id='line_379'>there every sort of meat and every sort of liquor that I have ever seen</a>
<a id='line_380'>elsewhere; but the meat and the liquor were better served there than I</a>
<a id='line_381'>have ever seen them in any other place.</a>
<a id='line_382'></a>
<a id='line_383'>“Until the repast was half over, neither the man nor any one of the</a>
<a id='line_384'>damsels spoke a single word to me; but when the man perceived that it</a>
<a id='line_385'>would be more agreeable to me to converse than to eat any more, he began</a>
<a id='line_386'>to inquire of me who I was.  I said I was glad to find that there was</a>
<a id='line_387'>some one who would discourse with me, and that it was not considered so</a>
<a id='line_388'>great a crime at that Court for people to hold converse together.</a>
<a id='line_389'>‘Chieftain,’ said the man, ‘we would have talked to thee sooner, but we</a>
<a id='line_390'>feared to disturb thee during thy repast; now, however, we will</a>
<a id='line_391'>discourse.’  Then I told the man who I was, and what was the cause of my</a>
<a id='line_392'>journey; and said that I was seeking whether any one was superior to me,</a>
<a id='line_393'>or whether I could gain the mastery over all.  The man looked upon me,</a>
<a id='line_394'>and he smiled and said, ‘If I did not fear to distress thee too much, I</a>
<a id='line_395'>would show thee that which thou seekest.’  Upon this I became anxious and</a>
<a id='line_396'>sorrowful, and when the man perceived it, he said, ‘If thou wouldest</a>
<a id='line_397'>rather that I should show thee thy disadvantage than thine advantage, I</a>
<a id='line_398'>will do so.  Sleep here to-night, and in the morning arise early, and</a>
<a id='line_399'>take the road upwards through the valley until thou reachest the wood</a>
<a id='line_400'>through which thou camest hither.  A little way within the wood thou wilt</a>
<a id='line_401'>meet with a road branching off to the right, by which thou must proceed,</a>
<a id='line_402'>until thou comest to a large sheltered glade with a mound in the centre.</a>
<a id='line_403'>And thou wilt see a black man of great stature on the top of the mound.</a>
<a id='line_404'>He is not smaller in size than two of the men of this world.  He has but</a>
<a id='line_405'>one foot; and one eye in the middle of his forehead.  And he has a club</a>
<a id='line_406'>of iron, and it is certain that there are no two men in the world who</a>
<a id='line_407'>would not find their burden in that club.  And he is not a comely man,</a>
<a id='line_408'>but on the contrary he is exceedingly ill-favoured; and he is the</a>
<a id='line_409'>woodward of that wood.  And thou wilt see a thousand wild animals grazing</a>
<a id='line_410'>around him.  Inquire of him the way out of the glade, and he will reply</a>
<a id='line_411'>to thee briefly, and will point out the road by which thou shalt find</a>
<a id='line_412'>that which thou art in quest of.’</a>
<a id='line_413'></a>
<a id='line_414'>“And long seemed that night to me.  And the next morning I arose and</a>
<a id='line_415'>equipped myself, and mounted my horse, and proceeded straight through the</a>
<a id='line_416'>valley to the wood; and I followed the cross-road which the man had</a>
<a id='line_417'>pointed out to me, till at length I arrived at the glade.  And there was</a>
<a id='line_418'>I three times more astonished at the number of wild animals that I</a>
<a id='line_419'>beheld, than the man had said I should be.  And the black man was there,</a>
<a id='line_420'>sitting upon the top of the mound.  Huge of stature as the man had told</a>
<a id='line_421'>me that he was, I found him to exceed by far the description he had given</a>
<a id='line_422'>me of him.  As for the iron club which the man had told me was a burden</a>
<a id='line_423'>for two men, I am certain, Kai, that it would be a heavy weight for four</a>
<a id='line_424'>warriors to lift; and this was in the black man’s hand.  And he only</a>
<a id='line_425'>spoke to me in answer to my questions.  Then I asked him what power he</a>
<a id='line_426'>held over those animals. ‘I will show thee, little man,’ said he.  And he</a>
<a id='line_427'>took his club in his hand, and with it he struck a stag a great blow so</a>
<a id='line_428'>that he brayed vehemently, and at his braying the animals came together,</a>
<a id='line_429'>as numerous as the stars in the sky, so that it was difficult for me to</a>
<a id='line_430'>find room in the glade to stand among them.  There were serpents, and</a>
<a id='line_431'>dragons, and divers sorts of animals.  And he looked at them, and bade</a>
<a id='line_432'>them go and feed; and they bowed their heads, and did him homage as</a>
<a id='line_433'>vassals to their lord.</a>
<a id='line_434'></a>
<a id='line_435'>“Then the black man said to me, ‘Seest thou now, little man, what power I</a>
<a id='line_436'>hold over these animals?’  Then I inquired of him the way, and he became</a>
<a id='line_437'>very rough in his manner to me; however, he asked me whither I would go?</a>
<a id='line_438'>And when I told him who I was and what I sought, he directed me.  ‘Take,’</a>
<a id='line_439'>said he, ‘that path that leads towards the head of the glade, and ascend</a>
<a id='line_440'>the wooded steep until thou comest to its summit; and there thou wilt</a>
<a id='line_441'>find an open space like to a large valley, and in the midst of it a tall</a>
<a id='line_442'>tree, whose branches are greener than the greenest pine-trees.  Under</a>
<a id='line_443'>this tree is a fountain, and by the side of the fountain a marble slab,</a>
<a id='line_444'>and on the marble slab a silver bowl, attached by a chain of silver, so</a>
<a id='line_445'>that it may not be carried away.  Take the bowl and throw a bowlful of</a>
<a id='line_446'>water upon the slab, and thou wilt hear a mighty peal of thunder, so that</a>
<a id='line_447'>thou wilt think that heaven and earth are trembling with its fury.  With</a>
<a id='line_448'>the thunder there will come a shower so severe that it will be scarce</a>
<a id='line_449'>possible for thee to endure it and live.  And the shower will be of</a>
<a id='line_450'>hailstones; and after the shower, the weather will become fair, but every</a>
<a id='line_451'>leaf that was upon the tree will have been carried away by the shower.</a>
<a id='line_452'>Then a flight of birds will come and alight upon the tree; and in thine</a>
<a id='line_453'>own country thou didst never hear a strain so sweet as that which they</a>
<a id='line_454'>will sing.  And at the moment thou art most delighted with the song of</a>
<a id='line_455'>the birds, thou wilt hear a murmuring and complaining coming towards thee</a>
<a id='line_456'>along the valley.  And thou wilt see a knight upon a coal-black horse,</a>
<a id='line_457'>clothed in black velvet, and with a pennon of black linen upon his lance;</a>
<a id='line_458'>and he will ride unto thee to encounter thee with the utmost speed.  If</a>
<a id='line_459'>thou fleest from him he will overtake thee, and if thou abidest there, as</a>
<a id='line_460'>sure as thou art a mounted knight, he will leave thee on foot.  And if</a>
<a id='line_461'>thou dost not find trouble in that adventure, thou needest not seek it</a>
<a id='line_462'>during the rest of thy life.’</a>
<a id='line_463'></a>
<a id='line_464'>“So I journeyed on, until I reached the summit of the steep, and there I</a>
<a id='line_465'>found everything as the black man had described it to me.  And I went up</a>
<a id='line_466'>to the tree, and beneath it I saw the fountain, and by its side the</a>
<a id='line_467'>marble slab, and the silver bowl fastened by the chain.  Then I took the</a>
<a id='line_468'>bowl, and cast a bowlful of water upon the slab; and thereupon, behold,</a>
<a id='line_469'>the thunder came, much more violent than the black man had led me to</a>
<a id='line_470'>expect; and after the thunder came the shower; and of a truth I tell</a>
<a id='line_471'>thee, Kai, that there is neither man nor beast that can endure that</a>
<a id='line_472'>shower and live.  For not one of those hailstones would be stopped,</a>
<a id='line_473'>either by the flesh or by the skin, until it had reached the bone.  I</a>
<a id='line_474'>turned my horse’s flank towards the shower, and placed the beak of my</a>
<a id='line_475'>shield over his head and neck, while I held the upper part of it over my</a>
<a id='line_476'>own head.  And thus I withstood the shower.  When I looked on the tree</a>
<a id='line_477'>there was not a single leaf upon it, and then the sky became clear, and</a>
<a id='line_478'>with that, behold the birds lighted upon the tree, and sang.  And truly,</a>
<a id='line_479'>Kai, I never heard any melody equal to that, either before or since.  And</a>
<a id='line_480'>when I was most charmed with listening to the birds, lo, a murmuring</a>
<a id='line_481'>voice was heard through the valley, approaching me and saying, ‘Oh,</a>
<a id='line_482'>Knight, what has brought thee hither?  What evil have I done to thee,</a>
<a id='line_483'>that thou shouldst act towards me and my possessions as thou hast this</a>
<a id='line_484'>day?  Dost thou not know that the shower to-day has left in my dominions</a>
<a id='line_485'>neither man nor beast alive that was exposed to it?’  And thereupon,</a>
<a id='line_486'>behold, a Knight on a black horse appeared, clothed in jet-black velvet,</a>
<a id='line_487'>and with a tabard of black linen about him.  And we charged each other,</a>
<a id='line_488'>and, as the onset was furious, it was not long before I was overthrown.</a>
<a id='line_489'>Then the Knight passed the shaft of his lance through the bridle rein of</a>
<a id='line_490'>my horse, and rode off with the two horses, leaving me where I was.  And</a>
<a id='line_491'>he did not even bestow so much notice upon me as to imprison me, nor did</a>
<a id='line_492'>he despoil me of my arms.  So I returned along the road by which I had</a>
<a id='line_493'>come.  And when I reached the glade where the black man was, I confess to</a>
<a id='line_494'>thee, Kai, it is a marvel that I did not melt down into a liquid pool,</a>
<a id='line_495'>through the shame that I felt at the black man’s derision.  And that</a>
<a id='line_496'>night I came to the same castle where I had spent the night preceding.</a>
<a id='line_497'>And I was more agreeably entertained that night than I had been the night</a>
<a id='line_498'>before; and I was better feasted, and I conversed freely with the inmates</a>
<a id='line_499'>of the castle, and none of them alluded to my expedition to the fountain,</a>
<a id='line_500'>neither did I mention it to any; and I remained there that night.  When I</a>
<a id='line_501'>arose on the morrow, I found, ready saddled, a dark bay palfrey, with</a>
<a id='line_502'>nostrils as red as scarlet; and after putting on my armour, and leaving</a>
<a id='line_503'>there my blessing, I returned to my own Court.  And that horse I still</a>
<a id='line_504'>possess, and he is in the stable yonder.  And I declare that I would not</a>
<a id='line_505'>part with him for the best palfrey in the Island of Britain.</a>
<a id='line_506'></a>
<a id='line_507'>“Now of a truth, Kai, no man ever before confessed to an adventure so</a>
<a id='line_508'>much to his own discredit, and verily it seems strange to me, that</a>
<a id='line_509'>neither before nor since have I heard of any person besides myself who</a>
<a id='line_510'>knew of this adventure, and that the subject of it should exist within</a>
<a id='line_511'>King Arthur’s dominions, without any other person lighting upon it.”</a>
<a id='line_512'></a>
<a id='line_513'>“Now,” quoth Owain, “would it not be well to go and endeavour to discover</a>
<a id='line_514'>that place?”</a>
<a id='line_515'></a>
<a id='line_516'>“By the hand of my friend,” said Kai, “often dost thou utter that with</a>
<a id='line_517'>thy tongue which thou wouldst not make good with thy deeds.”</a>
<a id='line_518'></a>
<a id='line_519'>“In very truth,” said Gwenhwyvar, “it were better thou wert hanged, Kai,</a>
<a id='line_520'>than to use such uncourteous speech towards a man like Owain.”</a>
<a id='line_521'></a>
<a id='line_522'>“By the hand of my friend, good Lady,” said Kai, “thy praise of Owain is</a>
<a id='line_523'>not greater than mine.”</a>
<a id='line_524'></a>
<a id='line_525'>With that Arthur awoke, and asked if he had not been sleeping a little.</a>
<a id='line_526'></a>
<a id='line_527'>“Yes, Lord,” answered Owain, “thou hast slept awhile.”</a>
<a id='line_528'></a>
<a id='line_529'>“Is it time for us to go to meat?”</a>
<a id='line_530'></a>
<a id='line_531'>“It is, Lord,” said Owain.</a>
<a id='line_532'></a>
<a id='line_533'>Then the horn for washing was sounded, and the King and all his household</a>
<a id='line_534'>sat down to eat.  And when the meal was ended, Owain withdrew to his</a>
<a id='line_535'>lodging, and made ready his horse and his arms.</a>
<a id='line_536'></a>
<a id='line_537'>On the morrow, with the dawn of day, he put on his armour, and mounted</a>
<a id='line_538'>his charger, and travelled through distant lands and over desert</a>
<a id='line_539'>mountains.  And at length he arrived at the valley which Kynon had</a>
<a id='line_540'>described to him; and he was certain that it was the same that he sought.</a>
<a id='line_541'>And journeying along the valley by the side of the river, he followed its</a>
<a id='line_542'>course till he came to the plain and within sight of the Castle.  When he</a>
<a id='line_543'>approached the Castle, he saw the youths shooting their daggers in the</a>
<a id='line_544'>place where Kynon had seen them, and the yellow man, to whom the Castle</a>
<a id='line_545'>belonged, standing hard by.  And no sooner had Owain saluted the yellow</a>
<a id='line_546'>man than he was saluted by him in return.</a>
<a id='line_547'></a>
<a id='line_548'>And he went forward towards the Castle, and there he saw the chamber, and</a>
<a id='line_549'>when he had entered the chamber he beheld the maidens working at satin</a>
<a id='line_550'>embroidery, in chairs of gold.  And their beauty and their comeliness</a>
<a id='line_551'>seemed to Owain far greater than Kynon had represented to him.  And they</a>
<a id='line_552'>rose to wait upon Owain, as they had done to Kynon, and the meal which</a>
<a id='line_553'>they set before him gave more satisfaction to Owain than it had done to</a>
<a id='line_554'>Kynon.</a>
<a id='line_555'></a>
<a id='line_556'>About the middle of the repast, the yellow man asked Owain the object of</a>
<a id='line_557'>his journey.  And Owain made it known to him, and said, “I am in quest of</a>
<a id='line_558'>the Knight who guards the fountain.”  Upon this the yellow man smiled,</a>
<a id='line_559'>and said that he was as loth to point out that adventure to Owain as he</a>
<a id='line_560'>had been to Kynon.  However, he described the whole to Owain, and they</a>
<a id='line_561'>retired to rest.</a>
<a id='line_562'></a>
<a id='line_563'>The next morning Owain found his horse made ready for him by the damsels,</a>
<a id='line_564'>and he set forward and came to the glade where the black man was.  And</a>
<a id='line_565'>the stature of the black man seemed more wonderful to Owain than it had</a>
<a id='line_566'>done to Kynon, and Owain asked of him his road, and he showed it to him.</a>
<a id='line_567'>And Owain followed the road, as Kynon had done, till he came to the green</a>
<a id='line_568'>tree; and he beheld the fountain, and the slab beside the fountain, with</a>
<a id='line_569'>the bowl upon it.  And Owain took the bowl, and threw a bowlful of water</a>
<a id='line_570'>upon the slab.  And, lo, the thunder was heard, and after the thunder</a>
<a id='line_571'>came the shower, much more violent than Kynon had described, and after</a>
<a id='line_572'>the shower the sky became bright.  And when Owain looked at the tree,</a>
<a id='line_573'>there was not one leaf upon it.  And immediately the birds came, and</a>
<a id='line_574'>settled upon the tree, and sang.  And when their song was most pleasing</a>
<a id='line_575'>to Owain, he beheld a Knight coming towards him through the valley, and</a>
<a id='line_576'>he prepared to receive him; and encountered him violently.  Having broken</a>
<a id='line_577'>both their lances, they drew their swords, and fought blade to blade.</a>
<a id='line_578'>Then Owain struck the Knight a blow through his helmet, head-piece and</a>
<a id='line_579'>visor, and through the skin, and the flesh, and the bone, until it</a>
<a id='line_580'>wounded the very brain.  Then the black Knight felt that he had received</a>
<a id='line_581'>a mortal wound, upon which he turned his horse’s head, and fled.  And</a>
<a id='line_582'>Owain pursued him, and followed close upon him, although he was not near</a>
<a id='line_583'>enough to strike him with his sword.  Thereupon Owain descried a vast and</a>
<a id='line_584'>resplendent Castle.  And they came to the Castle gate.  And the black</a>
<a id='line_585'>Knight was allowed to enter, and the portcullis was let fall upon Owain;</a>
<a id='line_586'>and it struck his horse behind the saddle, and cut him in two, and</a>
<a id='line_587'>carried away the rowels of the spurs that were upon Owain’s heels.  And</a>
<a id='line_588'>the portcullis descended to the floor.  And the rowels of the spurs and</a>
<a id='line_589'>part of the horse were without, and Owain with the other part of the</a>
<a id='line_590'>horse remained between the two gates, and the inner gate was closed, so</a>
<a id='line_591'>that Owain could not go thence; and Owain was in a perplexing situation.</a>
<a id='line_592'>And while he was in this state, he could see through an aperture in the</a>
<a id='line_593'>gate, a street facing him, with a row of houses on each side.  And he</a>
<a id='line_594'>beheld a maiden, with yellow curling hair, and a frontlet of gold upon</a>
<a id='line_595'>her head; and she was clad in a dress of yellow satin, and on her feet</a>
<a id='line_596'>were shoes of variegated leather.  And she approached the gate, and</a>
<a id='line_597'>desired that it should be opened.  “Heaven knows, Lady,” said Owain, “it</a>
<a id='line_598'>is no more possible for me to open to thee from hence, than it is for</a>
<a id='line_599'>thee to set me free.”  “Truly,” said the damsel, “it is very sad that</a>
<a id='line_600'>thou canst not be released, and every woman ought to succour thee, for I</a>
<a id='line_601'>never saw one more faithful in the service of ladies than thou.  As a</a>
<a id='line_602'>friend thou art the most sincere, and as a lover the most devoted.</a>
<a id='line_603'>Therefore,” quoth she, “whatever is in my power to do for thy release, I</a>
<a id='line_604'>will do it.  Take this ring and put it on thy finger, with the stone</a>
<a id='line_605'>inside thy hand; and close thy hand upon the stone.  And as long as thou</a>
<a id='line_606'>concealest it, it will conceal thee.  When they have consulted together,</a>
<a id='line_607'>they will come forth to fetch thee, in order to put thee to death; and</a>
<a id='line_608'>they will be much grieved that they cannot find thee.  And I will await</a>
<a id='line_609'>thee on the horseblock yonder; and thou wilt be able to see me, though I</a>
<a id='line_610'>cannot see thee; therefore come and place thy hand upon my shoulder, that</a>
<a id='line_611'>I may know that thou art near me.  And by the way that I go hence, do</a>
<a id='line_612'>thou accompany me.”</a>
<a id='line_613'></a>
<a id='line_614'>Then she went away from Owain, and he did all that the maiden had told</a>
<a id='line_615'>him.  And the people of the Castle came to seek Owain, to put him to</a>
<a id='line_616'>death, and when they found nothing but the half of his horse, they were</a>
<a id='line_617'>sorely grieved.</a>
<a id='line_618'></a>
<a id='line_619'>And Owain vanished from among them, and went to the maiden, and placed</a>
<a id='line_620'>his hand upon her shoulder; whereupon she set off, and Owain followed</a>
<a id='line_621'>her, until they came to the door of a large and beautiful chamber, and</a>
<a id='line_622'>the maiden opened it, and they went in, and closed the door.  And Owain</a>
<a id='line_623'>looked around the chamber, and behold there was not even a single nail in</a>
<a id='line_624'>it that was not painted with gorgeous colours; and there was not a single</a>
<a id='line_625'>panel that had not sundry images in gold portrayed upon it.</a>
<a id='line_626'></a>
<a id='line_627'>The maiden kindled a fire, and took water in a silver bowl, and put a</a>
<a id='line_628'>towel of white linen on her shoulder, and gave Owain water to wash.  Then</a>
<a id='line_629'>she placed before him a silver table, inlaid with gold; upon which was a</a>
<a id='line_630'>cloth of yellow linen; and she brought him food.  And of a truth, Owain</a>
<a id='line_631'>had never seen any kind of meat that was not there in abundance, but it</a>
<a id='line_632'>was better cooked there than he had ever found it in any other place.</a>
<a id='line_633'>Nor did he ever see so excellent a display of meat and drink, as there.</a>
<a id='line_634'>And there was not one vessel from which he was served, that was not of</a>
<a id='line_635'>gold or of silver.  And Owain ate and drank, until late in the afternoon,</a>
<a id='line_636'>when lo, they heard a mighty clamour in the Castle; and Owain asked the</a>
<a id='line_637'>maiden what that outcry was.  “They are administering extreme unction,”</a>
<a id='line_638'>said she, “to the Nobleman who owns the Castle.”  And Owain went to</a>
<a id='line_639'>sleep.</a>
<a id='line_640'></a>
<a id='line_641'>The couch which the maiden had prepared for him was meet for Arthur</a>
<a id='line_642'>himself; it was of scarlet, and fur, and satin, and sendal, and fine</a>
<a id='line_643'>linen.  In the middle of the night they heard a woful outcry.  “What</a>
<a id='line_644'>outcry again is this?” said Owain.  “The Nobleman who owned the Castle is</a>
<a id='line_645'>now dead,” said the maiden.  And a little after daybreak, they heard an</a>
<a id='line_646'>exceeding loud clamour and wailing.  And Owain asked the maiden what was</a>
<a id='line_647'>the cause of it.  “They are bearing to the church the body of the</a>
<a id='line_648'>Nobleman who owned the Castle.”</a>
<a id='line_649'></a>
<a id='line_650'>And Owain rose up, and clothed himself, and opened a window of the</a>
<a id='line_651'>chamber, and looked towards the Castle; and he could see neither the</a>
<a id='line_652'>bounds, nor the extent of the hosts that filled the streets.  And they</a>
<a id='line_653'>were fully armed; and a vast number of women were with them, both on</a>
<a id='line_654'>horseback and on foot; and all the ecclesiastics in the city, singing.</a>
<a id='line_655'>And it seemed to Owain that the sky resounded with the vehemence of their</a>
<a id='line_656'>cries, and with the noise of the trumpets, and with the singing of the</a>
<a id='line_657'>ecclesiastics.  In the midst of the throng, he beheld the bier, over</a>
<a id='line_658'>which was a veil of white linen; and wax tapers were burning beside and</a>
<a id='line_659'>around it, and none that supported the bier was lower in rank than a</a>
<a id='line_660'>powerful Baron.</a>
<a id='line_661'></a>
<a id='line_662'>Never did Owain see an assemblage so gorgeous with satin, and silk, and</a>
<a id='line_663'>sendal.  And following the train, he beheld a lady with yellow hair</a>
<a id='line_664'>falling over her shoulders, and stained with blood; and about her a dress</a>
<a id='line_665'>of yellow satin, which was torn.  Upon her feet were shoes of variegated</a>
<a id='line_666'>leather.  And it was a marvel that the ends of her fingers were not</a>
<a id='line_667'>bruised, from the violence with which she smote her hands together.</a>
<a id='line_668'>Truly she would have been the fairest lady Owain ever saw, had she been</a>
<a id='line_669'>in her usual guise.  And her cry was louder than the shout of the men, or</a>
<a id='line_670'>the clamour of the trumpets.  No sooner had he beheld the lady, than he</a>
<a id='line_671'>became inflamed with her love, so that it took entire possession of him.</a>
<a id='line_672'></a>
<a id='line_673'>Then he inquired of the maiden who the lady was.  “Heaven knows,” replied</a>
<a id='line_674'>the maiden, “she may be said to be the fairest, and the most chaste, and</a>
<a id='line_675'>the most liberal, and the wisest, and the most noble of women.  And she</a>
<a id='line_676'>is my mistress; and she is called the Countess of the Fountain, the wife</a>
<a id='line_677'>of him whom thou didst slay yesterday.”  “Verily,” said Owain, “she is</a>
<a id='line_678'>the woman that I love best.”  “Verily,” said the maiden, “she shall also</a>
<a id='line_679'>love thee not a little.”</a>
<a id='line_680'></a>
<a id='line_681'>And with that the maid arose, and kindled a fire, and filled a pot with</a>
<a id='line_682'>water, and placed it to warm; and she brought a towel of white linen, and</a>
<a id='line_683'>placed it around Owain’s neck; and she took a goblet of ivory, and a</a>
<a id='line_684'>silver basin, and filled them with warm water, wherewith she washed</a>
<a id='line_685'>Owain’s head.  Then she opened a wooden casket, and drew forth a razor,</a>
<a id='line_686'>whose haft was of ivory, and upon which were two rivets of gold.  And she</a>
<a id='line_687'>shaved his beard, and she dried his head, and his throat, with the towel.</a>
<a id='line_688'>Then she rose up from before Owain, and brought him to eat.  And truly</a>
<a id='line_689'>Owain had never so good a meal, nor was he ever so well served.</a>
<a id='line_690'></a>
<a id='line_691'>When he had finished his repast, the maiden arranged his couch.  “Come</a>
<a id='line_692'>here,” said she, “and sleep, and I will go and woo for thee.”  And Owain</a>
<a id='line_693'>went to sleep, and the maiden shut the door of the chamber after her, and</a>
<a id='line_694'>went towards the Castle.  When she came there, she found nothing but</a>
<a id='line_695'>mourning, and sorrow; and the Countess in her chamber could not bear the</a>
<a id='line_696'>sight of any one through grief.  Luned came and saluted her, but the</a>
<a id='line_697'>Countess answered her not.  And the maiden bent down towards her, and</a>
<a id='line_698'>said, “What aileth thee, that thou answerest no one to-day?”  “Luned,”</a>
<a id='line_699'>said the Countess, “what change hath befallen thee, that thou hast not</a>
<a id='line_700'>come to visit me in my grief?  It was wrong in thee, and I having made</a>
<a id='line_701'>thee rich; it was wrong in thee that thou didst not come to see me in my</a>
<a id='line_702'>distress.  That was wrong in thee.”  “Truly,” said Luned, “I thought thy</a>
<a id='line_703'>good sense was greater than I find it to be.  Is it well for thee to</a>
<a id='line_704'>mourn after that good man, or for anything else, that thou canst not</a>
<a id='line_705'>have?”  “I declare to heaven,” said the Countess, “that in the whole</a>
<a id='line_706'>world there is not a man equal to him.”  “Not so,” said Luned, “for an</a>
<a id='line_707'>ugly man would be as good as, or better than he.”  “I declare to heaven,”</a>
<a id='line_708'>said the Countess, “that were it not repugnant to me to cause to be put</a>
<a id='line_709'>to death one whom I have brought up, I would have thee executed, for</a>
<a id='line_710'>making such a comparison to me.  As it is, I will banish thee.”  “I am</a>
<a id='line_711'>glad,” said Luned, “that thou hast no other cause to do so, than that I</a>
<a id='line_712'>would have been of service to thee where thou didst not know what was to</a>
<a id='line_713'>thine advantage.  And henceforth evil betide whichever of us shall make</a>
<a id='line_714'>the first advance towards reconciliation to the other; whether I should</a>
<a id='line_715'>seek an invitation from thee, or thou of thine own accord shouldst send</a>
<a id='line_716'>to invite me.”</a>
<a id='line_717'></a>
<a id='line_718'>With that Luned went forth: and the Countess arose and followed her to</a>
<a id='line_719'>the door of the chamber, and began coughing loudly.  And when Luned</a>
<a id='line_720'>looked back, the Countess beckoned to her; and she returned to the</a>
<a id='line_721'>Countess.  “In truth,” said the Countess, “evil is thy disposition; but</a>
<a id='line_722'>if thou knowest what is to my advantage, declare it to me.”  “I will do</a>
<a id='line_723'>so,” quoth she.</a>
<a id='line_724'></a>
<a id='line_725'>“Thou knowest that except by warfare and arms it is impossible for thee</a>
<a id='line_726'>to preserve thy possessions; delay not, therefore, to seek some one who</a>
<a id='line_727'>can defend them.”  “And how can I do that?” said the Countess.  “I will</a>
<a id='line_728'>tell thee,” said Luned.  “Unless thou canst defend the fountain, thou</a>
<a id='line_729'>canst not maintain thy dominions; and no one can defend the fountain,</a>
<a id='line_730'>except it be a knight of Arthur’s household; and I will go to Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_731'>Court, and ill betide me, if I return thence without a warrior who can</a>
<a id='line_732'>guard the fountain as well as, or even better than, he who defended it</a>
<a id='line_733'>formerly.”  “That will be hard to perform,” said the Countess.  “Go,</a>
<a id='line_734'>however, and make proof of that which thou hast promised.”</a>
<a id='line_735'></a>
<a id='line_736'>Luned set out, under the pretence of going to Arthur’s Court; but she</a>
<a id='line_737'>went back to the chamber where she had left Owain; and she tarried there</a>
<a id='line_738'>with him as long as it might have taken her to have travelled to the</a>
<a id='line_739'>Court of King Arthur.  And at the end of that time, she apparelled</a>
<a id='line_740'>herself and went to visit the Countess.  And the Countess was much</a>
<a id='line_741'>rejoiced when she saw her, and inquired what news she brought from the</a>
<a id='line_742'>Court.  “I bring thee the best of news,” said Luned, “for I have</a>
<a id='line_743'>compassed the object of my mission.  When wilt thou, that I should</a>
<a id='line_744'>present to thee the chieftain who has come with me hither?”  “Bring him</a>
<a id='line_745'>here to visit me to-morrow, at mid-day,” said the Countess, “and I will</a>
<a id='line_746'>cause the town to be assembled by that time.”</a>
<a id='line_747'></a>
<a id='line_748'>And Luned returned home.  And the next day, at noon, Owain arrayed</a>
<a id='line_749'>himself in a coat, and a surcoat, and a mantle of yellow satin, upon</a>
<a id='line_750'>which was a broad band of gold lace; and on his feet were high shoes of</a>
<a id='line_751'>variegated leather, which were fastened by golden clasps, in the form of</a>
<a id='line_752'>lions.  And they proceeded to the chamber of the Countess.</a>
<a id='line_753'></a>
<a id='line_754'>Right glad was the Countess of their coming, and she gazed steadfastly</a>
<a id='line_755'>upon Owain, and said, “Luned, this knight has not the look of a</a>
<a id='line_756'>traveller.”  “What harm is there in that, lady?” said Luned.  “I am</a>
<a id='line_757'>certain,” said the Countess, “that no other man than this chased the soul</a>
<a id='line_758'>from the body of my lord.”  “So much the better for thee, lady,” said</a>
<a id='line_759'>Luned, “for had he not been stronger than thy lord he could not have</a>
<a id='line_760'>deprived him of life.  There is no remedy for that which is past, be it</a>
<a id='line_761'>as it may.”  “Go back to thine abode,” said the Countess, “and I will</a>
<a id='line_762'>take counsel.”</a>
<a id='line_763'></a>
<a id='line_764'>The next day the Countess caused all her subjects to assemble, and showed</a>
<a id='line_765'>them that her earldom was left defenceless, and that it could not be</a>
<a id='line_766'>protected but with horse and arms, and military skill.  “Therefore,” said</a>
<a id='line_767'>she, “this is what I offer for your choice: either let one of you take</a>
<a id='line_768'>me, or give your consent for me to take a husband from elsewhere to</a>
<a id='line_769'>defend my dominions.”</a>
<a id='line_770'></a>
<a id='line_771'>So they came to the determination that it was better that she should have</a>
<a id='line_772'>permission to marry some one from elsewhere; and, thereupon, she sent for</a>
<a id='line_773'>the bishops and archbishops to celebrate her nuptials with Owain.  And</a>
<a id='line_774'>the men of the earldom did Owain homage.</a>
<a id='line_775'></a>
<a id='line_776'>And Owain defended the Fountain with lance and sword.  And this is the</a>
<a id='line_777'>manner in which he defended it: Whensoever a knight came there he</a>
<a id='line_778'>overthrew him, and sold him for his full worth, and what he thus gained</a>
<a id='line_779'>he divided among his barons and his knights; and no man in the whole</a>
<a id='line_780'>world could be more beloved than he was by his subjects.  And it was thus</a>
<a id='line_781'>for the space of three years.</a>
<a id='line_782'></a>
<a id='line_783'>                                * * * * *</a>
<a id='line_784'></a>
<a id='line_785'>It befell that as Gwalchmai went forth one day with King Arthur, he</a>
<a id='line_786'>perceived him to be very sad and sorrowful.  And Gwalchmai was much</a>
<a id='line_787'>grieved to see Arthur in this state; and he questioned him, saying, “Oh,</a>
<a id='line_788'>my lord! what has befallen thee?”  “In sooth, Gwalchmai,” said Arthur, “I</a>
<a id='line_789'>am grieved concerning Owain, whom I have lost these three years, and I</a>
<a id='line_790'>shall certainly die if the fourth year passes without my seeing him.  Now</a>
<a id='line_791'>I am sure, that it is through the tale which Kynon the son of Clydno</a>
<a id='line_792'>related, that I have lost Owain.”  “There is no need for thee,” said</a>
<a id='line_793'>Gwalchmai, “to summon to arms thy whole dominions on this account, for</a>
<a id='line_794'>thou thyself and the men of thy household will be able to avenge Owain,</a>
<a id='line_795'>if he be slain; or to set him free, if he be in prison; and, if alive, to</a>
<a id='line_796'>bring him back with thee.”  And it was settled according to what</a>
<a id='line_797'>Gwalchmai had said.</a>
<a id='line_798'></a>
<a id='line_799'>Then Arthur and the men of his household prepared to go and seek Owain,</a>
<a id='line_800'>and their number was three thousand, besides their attendants.  And Kynon</a>
<a id='line_801'>the son of Clydno acted as their guide.  And Arthur came to the Castle</a>
<a id='line_802'>where Kynon had been before, and when he came there the youths were</a>
<a id='line_803'>shooting in the same place, and the yellow man was standing hard by.</a>
<a id='line_804'>When the yellow man saw Arthur he greeted him, and invited him to the</a>
<a id='line_805'>Castle; and Arthur accepted his invitation, and they entered the Castle</a>
<a id='line_806'>together.  And great as was the number of his retinue, their presence was</a>
<a id='line_807'>scarcely observed in the Castle, so vast was its extent.  And the maidens</a>
<a id='line_808'>rose up to wait on them, and the service of the maidens appeared to them</a>
<a id='line_809'>all to excel any attendance they had ever met with; and even the pages</a>
<a id='line_810'>who had charge of the horses were no worse served, that night, than</a>
<a id='line_811'>Arthur himself would have been in his own palace.</a>
<a id='line_812'></a>
<a id='line_813'>The next morning Arthur set out thence, with Kynon for his guide, and</a>
<a id='line_814'>came to the place where the black man was.  And the stature of the black</a>
<a id='line_815'>man was more surprising to Arthur than it had been represented to him.</a>
<a id='line_816'>And they came to the top of the wooded steep, and traversed the valley</a>
<a id='line_817'>till they reached the green tree, where they saw the fountain, and the</a>
<a id='line_818'>bowl, and the slab.  And upon that, Kai came to Arthur and spoke to him.</a>
<a id='line_819'>“My lord,” said he, “I know the meaning of all this, and my request is,</a>
<a id='line_820'>that thou wilt permit me to throw the water on the slab, and to receive</a>
<a id='line_821'>the first adventure that may befall.”  And Arthur gave him leave.</a>
<a id='line_822'></a>
<a id='line_823'>Then Kai threw a bowlful of water upon the slab, and immediately there</a>
<a id='line_824'>came the thunder, and after the thunder the shower.  And such a</a>
<a id='line_825'>thunderstorm they had never known before, and many of the attendants who</a>
<a id='line_826'>were in Arthur’s train were killed by the shower.  After the shower had</a>
<a id='line_827'>ceased the sky became clear; and on looking at the tree they beheld it</a>
<a id='line_828'>completely leafless.  Then the birds descended upon the tree, and the</a>
<a id='line_829'>song of the birds was far sweeter than any strain they had ever heard</a>
<a id='line_830'>before.  Then they beheld a knight on a coal-black horse, clothed in</a>
<a id='line_831'>black satin, coming rapidly towards them.  And Kai met him and</a>
<a id='line_832'>encountered him, and it was not long before Kai was overthrown.  And the</a>
<a id='line_833'>knight withdrew, and Arthur and his host encamped for the night.</a>
<a id='line_834'></a>
<a id='line_835'>And when they arose in the morning, they perceived the signal of combat</a>
<a id='line_836'>upon the lance of the Knight.  And Kai came to Arthur, and spoke to him:</a>
<a id='line_837'>“My lord,” said he, “though I was overthrown yesterday, if it seem good</a>
<a id='line_838'>to thee, I would gladly meet the Knight again to-day.”  “Thou mayst do</a>
<a id='line_839'>so,” said Arthur.  And Kai went towards the Knight.  And on the spot he</a>
<a id='line_840'>overthrew Kai, and struck him with the head of his lance in the forehead,</a>
<a id='line_841'>so that it broke his helmet and the head-piece, and pierced the skin and</a>
<a id='line_842'>the flesh, the breadth of the spear-head, even to the bone.  And Kai</a>
<a id='line_843'>returned to his companions.</a>
<a id='line_844'></a>
<a id='line_845'>After this, all the household of Arthur went forth, one after the other,</a>
<a id='line_846'>to combat the Knight, until there was not one that was not overthrown by</a>
<a id='line_847'>him, except Arthur and Gwalchmai.  And Arthur armed himself to encounter</a>
<a id='line_848'>the Knight.  “Oh, my lord,” said Gwalchmai, “permit me to fight with him</a>
<a id='line_849'>first.”  And Arthur permitted him.  And he went forth to meet the Knight,</a>
<a id='line_850'>having over himself and his horse a satin robe of honour which had been</a>
<a id='line_851'>sent him by the daughter of the Earl of Rhangyw, and in this dress he was</a>
<a id='line_852'>not known by any of the host.  And they charged each other, and fought</a>
<a id='line_853'>all that day until the evening, and neither of them was able to unhorse</a>
<a id='line_854'>the other.</a>
<a id='line_855'></a>
<a id='line_856'>The next day they fought with strong lances, and neither of them could</a>
<a id='line_857'>obtain the mastery.</a>
<a id='line_858'></a>
<a id='line_859'>And the third day they fought with exceeding strong lances.  And they</a>
<a id='line_860'>were incensed with rage, and fought furiously, even until noon.  And they</a>
<a id='line_861'>gave each other such a shock that the girths of their horses were broken,</a>
<a id='line_862'>so that they fell over their horses’ cruppers to the ground.  And they</a>
<a id='line_863'>rose up speedily, and drew their swords, and resumed the combat; and the</a>
<a id='line_864'>multitude that witnessed their encounter felt assured that they had never</a>
<a id='line_865'>before seen two men so valiant or so powerful.  And had it been midnight,</a>
<a id='line_866'>it would have been light from the fire that flashed from their weapons.</a>
<a id='line_867'>And the Knight gave Gwalchmai a blow that turned his helmet from off his</a>
<a id='line_868'>face, so that the Knight knew that it was Gwalchmai.  Then Owain said,</a>
<a id='line_869'>“My lord Gwalchmai, I did not know thee for my cousin, owing to the robe</a>
<a id='line_870'>of honour that enveloped thee; take my sword and my arms.”  Said</a>
<a id='line_871'>Gwalchmai, “Thou, Owain, art the victor; take thou my sword.”  And with</a>
<a id='line_872'>that Arthur saw that they were conversing, and advanced towards them.</a>
<a id='line_873'>“My lord Arthur,” said Gwalchmai, “here is Owain, who has vanquished me,</a>
<a id='line_874'>and will not take my arms.”  “My lord,” said Owain, “it is he that has</a>
<a id='line_875'>vanquished me, and he will not take my sword.”  “Give me your swords,”</a>
<a id='line_876'>said Arthur, “and then neither of you has vanquished the other.”  Then</a>
<a id='line_877'>Owain put his arms around Arthur’s neck, and they embraced.  And all the</a>
<a id='line_878'>host hurried forward to see Owain, and to embrace him; and there was nigh</a>
<a id='line_879'>being a loss of life, so great was the press.</a>
<a id='line_880'></a>
<a id='line_881'>And they retired that night, and the next day Arthur prepared to depart.</a>
<a id='line_882'>“My lord,” said Owain, “this is not well of thee; for I have been absent</a>
<a id='line_883'>from thee these three years, and during all that time, up to this very</a>
<a id='line_884'>day, I have been preparing a banquet for thee, knowing that thou wouldst</a>
<a id='line_885'>come to seek me.  Tarry with me, therefore, until thou and thy attendants</a>
<a id='line_886'>have recovered the fatigues of the journey, and have been anointed.”</a>
<a id='line_887'></a>
<a id='line_888'>And they all proceeded to the Castle of the Countess of the Fountain, and</a>
<a id='line_889'>the banquet which had been three years preparing was consumed in three</a>
<a id='line_890'>months.  Never had they a more delicious or agreeable banquet.  And</a>
<a id='line_891'>Arthur prepared to depart.  Then he sent an embassy to the Countess, to</a>
<a id='line_892'>beseech her to permit Owain to go with him for the space of three months,</a>
<a id='line_893'>that he might show him to the nobles and the fair dames of the Island of</a>
<a id='line_894'>Britain.  And the Countess gave her consent, although it was very painful</a>
<a id='line_895'>to her.  So Owain came with Arthur to the Island of Britain.  And when he</a>
<a id='line_896'>was once more amongst his kindred and friends, he remained three years,</a>
<a id='line_897'>instead of three months, with them.</a>
<a id='line_898'></a>
<a id='line_899'>                                * * * * *</a>
<a id='line_900'></a>
<a id='line_901'>And as Owain one day sat at meat, in the city of Caerlleon upon Usk,</a>
<a id='line_902'>behold a damsel entered upon a bay horse, with a curling mane and covered</a>
<a id='line_903'>with foam, and the bridle and so much as was seen of the saddle were of</a>
<a id='line_904'>gold.  And the damsel was arrayed in a dress of yellow satin.  And she</a>
<a id='line_905'>came up to Owain, and took the ring from off his hand.  “Thus,” said she,</a>
<a id='line_906'>“shall be treated the deceiver, the traitor, the faithless, the</a>
<a id='line_907'>disgraced, and the beardless.”  And she turned her horse’s head and</a>
<a id='line_908'>departed.</a>
<a id='line_909'></a>
<a id='line_910'>Then his adventure came to Owain’s remembrance, and he was sorrowful; and</a>
<a id='line_911'>having finished eating he went to his own abode and made preparations</a>
<a id='line_912'>that night.  And the next day he arose but did not go to the Court, but</a>
<a id='line_913'>wandered to the distant parts of the earth and to uncultivated mountains.</a>
<a id='line_914'>And he remained there until all his apparel was worn out, and his body</a>
<a id='line_915'>was wasted away, and his hair was grown long.  And he went about with the</a>
<a id='line_916'>wild beasts and fed with them, until they became familiar with him; but</a>
<a id='line_917'>at length he grew so weak that he could no longer bear them company.</a>
<a id='line_918'>Then he descended from the mountains to the valley, and came to a park</a>
<a id='line_919'>that was the fairest in the world, and belonged to a widowed Countess.</a>
<a id='line_920'></a>
<a id='line_921'>One day the Countess and her maidens went forth to walk by a lake, that</a>
<a id='line_922'>was in the middle of the park.  And they saw the form of a man.  And they</a>
<a id='line_923'>were terrified.  Nevertheless they went near him, and touched him, and</a>
<a id='line_924'>looked at him.  And they saw that there was life in him, though he was</a>
<a id='line_925'>exhausted by the heat of the sun.  And the Countess returned to the</a>
<a id='line_926'>Castle, and took a flask full of precious ointment, and gave it to one of</a>
<a id='line_927'>her maidens.  “Go with this,” said she, “and take with thee yonder horse</a>
<a id='line_928'>and clothing, and place them near the man we saw just now.  And anoint</a>
<a id='line_929'>him with this balsam, near his heart; and if there is life in him, he</a>
<a id='line_930'>will arise through the efficacy of this balsam.  Then watch what he will</a>
<a id='line_931'>do.”</a>
<a id='line_932'></a>
<a id='line_933'>And the maiden departed from her, and poured the whole of the balsam upon</a>
<a id='line_934'>Owain, and left the horse and the garments hard by, and went a little way</a>
<a id='line_935'>off, and hid herself to watch him.  In a short time she saw him begin to</a>
<a id='line_936'>move his arms; and he rose up, and looked at his person, and became</a>
<a id='line_937'>ashamed of the unseemliness of his appearance.  Then he perceived the</a>
<a id='line_938'>horse and the garments that were near him.  And he crept forward till he</a>
<a id='line_939'>was able to draw the garments to him from off the saddle.  And he clothed</a>
<a id='line_940'>himself, and with difficulty mounted the horse.  Then the damsel</a>
<a id='line_941'>discovered herself to him, and saluted him.  And he was rejoiced when he</a>
<a id='line_942'>saw her, and inquired of her, what land and what territory that was.</a>
<a id='line_943'>“Truly,” said the maiden, “a widowed Countess owns yonder Castle; at the</a>
<a id='line_944'>death of her husband, he left her two Earldoms, but at this day she has</a>
<a id='line_945'>but this one dwelling that has not been wrested from her by a young Earl,</a>
<a id='line_946'>who is her neighbour, because she refused to become his wife.”  “That is</a>
<a id='line_947'>pity,” said Owain.  And he and the maiden proceeded to the Castle; and he</a>
<a id='line_948'>alighted there, and the maiden conducted him to a pleasant chamber, and</a>
<a id='line_949'>kindled a fire and left him.</a>
<a id='line_950'></a>
<a id='line_951'>And the maiden came to the Countess, and gave the flask into her hand.</a>
<a id='line_952'>“Ha! maiden,” said the Countess, “where is all the balsam?”  “Have I not</a>
<a id='line_953'>used it all?” said she.  “Oh, maiden,” said the Countess, “I cannot</a>
<a id='line_954'>easily forgive thee this; it is sad for me to have wasted seven-score</a>
<a id='line_955'>pounds’ worth of precious ointment upon a stranger whom I know not.</a>
<a id='line_956'>However, maiden, wait thou upon him, until he is quite recovered.”</a>
<a id='line_957'></a>
<a id='line_958'>And the maiden did so, and furnished him with meat and drink, and fire,</a>
<a id='line_959'>and lodging, and medicaments, until he was well again.  And in three</a>
<a id='line_960'>months he was restored to his former guise, and became even more comely</a>
<a id='line_961'>than he had ever been before.</a>
<a id='line_962'></a>
<a id='line_963'>One day Owain heard a great tumult, and a sound of arms in the Castle,</a>
<a id='line_964'>and he inquired of the maiden the cause thereof.  “The Earl,” said she,</a>
<a id='line_965'>“whom I mentioned to thee, has come before the Castle, with a numerous</a>
<a id='line_966'>army, to subdue the Countess.”  And Owain inquired of her whether the</a>
<a id='line_967'>Countess had a horse and arms in her possession.  “She has the best in</a>
<a id='line_968'>the world,” said the maiden.  “Wilt thou go and request the loan of a</a>
<a id='line_969'>horse and arms for me,” said Owain, “that I may go and look at this</a>
<a id='line_970'>army?”  “I will,” said the maiden.</a>
<a id='line_971'></a>
<a id='line_972'>And she came to the Countess, and told her what Owain had said.  And the</a>
<a id='line_973'>Countess laughed.  “Truly,” said she, “I will even give him a horse and</a>
<a id='line_974'>arms for ever; such a horse and such arms had he never yet, and I am glad</a>
<a id='line_975'>that they should be taken by him to-day, lest my enemies should have them</a>
<a id='line_976'>against my will to-morrow.  Yet I know not what he would do with them.”</a>
<a id='line_977'></a>
<a id='line_978'>The Countess bade them bring out a beautiful black steed, upon which was</a>
<a id='line_979'>a beechen saddle, and a suit of armour, for man and horse.  And Owain</a>
<a id='line_980'>armed himself, and mounted the horse, and went forth, attended by two</a>
<a id='line_981'>pages completely equipped, with horses and arms.  And when they came near</a>
<a id='line_982'>to the Earl’s army, they could see neither its extent nor its extremity.</a>
<a id='line_983'>And Owain asked the pages in which troop the Earl was.  “In yonder</a>
<a id='line_984'>troop,” said they, “in which are four yellow standards.  Two of them are</a>
<a id='line_985'>before, and two behind him.”  “Now,” said Owain, “do you return and await</a>
<a id='line_986'>me near the portal of the Castle.”  So they returned, and Owain pressed</a>
<a id='line_987'>forward until he met the Earl.  And Owain drew him completely out of his</a>
<a id='line_988'>saddle, and turned his horse’s head towards the Castle, and though it was</a>
<a id='line_989'>with difficulty, he brought the Earl to the portal, where the pages</a>
<a id='line_990'>awaited him.  And in they came.  And Owain presented the Earl as a gift</a>
<a id='line_991'>to the Countess.  And said to her, “Behold a requital to thee for thy</a>
<a id='line_992'>blessed balsam.”</a>
<a id='line_993'></a>
<a id='line_994'>The army encamped around the Castle.  And the Earl restored to the</a>
<a id='line_995'>Countess the two Earldoms he had taken from her, as a ransom for his</a>
<a id='line_996'>life; and for his freedom he gave her the half of his own dominions, and</a>
<a id='line_997'>all his gold, and his silver, and his jewels, besides hostages.</a>
<a id='line_998'></a>
<a id='line_999'>And Owain took his departure.  And the Countess and all her subjects</a>
<a id='line_1000'>besought him to remain, but Owain chose rather to wander through distant</a>
<a id='line_1001'>lands and deserts.</a>
<a id='line_1002'></a>
<a id='line_1003'>And as he journeyed, he heard a loud yelling in a wood.  And it was</a>
<a id='line_1004'>repeated a second and a third time.  And Owain went towards the spot, and</a>
<a id='line_1005'>beheld a huge craggy mound, in the middle of the wood; on the side of</a>
<a id='line_1006'>which was a grey rock.  And there was a cleft in the rock, and a serpent</a>
<a id='line_1007'>was within the cleft.  And near the rock stood a black lion, and every</a>
<a id='line_1008'>time the lion sought to go thence, the serpent darted towards him to</a>
<a id='line_1009'>attack him.  And Owain unsheathed his sword, and drew near to the rock;</a>
<a id='line_1010'>and as the serpent sprang out, he struck him with his sword, and cut him</a>
<a id='line_1011'>in two.  And he dried his sword, and went on his way, as before.  But</a>
<a id='line_1012'>behold the lion followed him, and played about him, as though it had been</a>
<a id='line_1013'>a greyhound that he had reared.</a>
<a id='line_1014'></a>
<a id='line_1015'>They proceeded thus throughout the day, until the evening.  And when it</a>
<a id='line_1016'>was time for Owain to take his rest, he dismounted, and turned his horse</a>
<a id='line_1017'>loose in a flat and wooded meadow.  And he struck fire, and when the fire</a>
<a id='line_1018'>was kindled, the lion brought him fuel enough to last for three nights.</a>
<a id='line_1019'>And the lion disappeared.  And presently the lion returned, bearing a</a>
<a id='line_1020'>fine large roebuck.  And he threw it down before Owain, who went towards</a>
<a id='line_1021'>the fire with it.</a>
<a id='line_1022'></a>
<a id='line_1023'>And Owain took the roebuck, and skinned it, and placed collops of its</a>
<a id='line_1024'>flesh upon skewers, around the fire.  The rest of the buck he gave to the</a>
<a id='line_1025'>lion to devour.  While he was doing this, he heard a deep sigh near him,</a>
<a id='line_1026'>and a second, and a third.  And Owain called out to know whether the sigh</a>
<a id='line_1027'>he heard proceeded from a mortal; and he received answer that it did.</a>
<a id='line_1028'>“Who art thou?” said Owain.  “Truly,” said the voice, “I am Luned, the</a>
<a id='line_1029'>handmaiden of the Countess of the Fountain.”  “And what dost thou here?”</a>
<a id='line_1030'>said Owain.  “I am imprisoned,” said she, “on account of the knight who</a>
<a id='line_1031'>came from Arthur’s Court, and married the Countess.  And he stayed a</a>
<a id='line_1032'>short time with her, but he afterwards departed for the Court of Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_1033'>and has not returned since.  And he was the friend I loved best in the</a>
<a id='line_1034'>world.  And two of the pages in the Countess’s chamber traduced him, and</a>
<a id='line_1035'>called him a deceiver.  And I told them that they two were not a match</a>
<a id='line_1036'>for him alone.  So they imprisoned me in the stone vault, and said that I</a>
<a id='line_1037'>should be put to death, unless he came himself to deliver me, by a</a>
<a id='line_1038'>certain day; and that is no further off than the day after to-morrow.</a>
<a id='line_1039'>And I have no one to send to seek him for me.  And his name is Owain the</a>
<a id='line_1040'>son of Urien.”  “And art thou certain that if that knight knew all this,</a>
<a id='line_1041'>he would come to thy rescue?”  “I am most certain of it,” said she.</a>
<a id='line_1042'></a>
<a id='line_1043'>When the collops were cooked, Owain divided them into two parts, between</a>
<a id='line_1044'>himself and the maiden; and after they had eaten, they talked together,</a>
<a id='line_1045'>until the day dawned.  And the next morning Owain inquired of the damsel,</a>
<a id='line_1046'>if there was any place where he could get food and entertainment for that</a>
<a id='line_1047'>night.  “There is, Lord,” said she; “cross over yonder, and go along the</a>
<a id='line_1048'>side of the river, and in a short time thou wilt see a great Castle, in</a>
<a id='line_1049'>which are many towers, and the Earl who owns that Castle is the most</a>
<a id='line_1050'>hospitable man in the world.  There thou mayst spend the night.”</a>
<a id='line_1051'></a>
<a id='line_1052'>Never did sentinel keep stricter watch over his lord, than the lion that</a>
<a id='line_1053'>night over Owain.</a>
<a id='line_1054'></a>
<a id='line_1055'>And Owain accoutred his horse, and passed across by the ford, and came in</a>
<a id='line_1056'>sight of the Castle.  And he entered it, and was honourably received.</a>
<a id='line_1057'>And his horse was well cared for, and plenty of fodder was placed before</a>
<a id='line_1058'>him.  Then the lion went and lay down in the horse’s manger; so that none</a>
<a id='line_1059'>of the people of the Castle dared to approach him.  The treatment which</a>
<a id='line_1060'>Owain met with there was such as he had never known elsewhere, for every</a>
<a id='line_1061'>one was as sorrowful as though death had been upon him.  And they went to</a>
<a id='line_1062'>meat; and the Earl sat upon one side of Owain, and on the other side his</a>
<a id='line_1063'>only daughter.  And Owain had never seen any more lovely than she.  Then</a>
<a id='line_1064'>the lion came and placed himself between Owain’s feet, and he fed him</a>
<a id='line_1065'>with every kind of food that he took himself.  And he never saw anything</a>
<a id='line_1066'>equal to the sadness of the people.</a>
<a id='line_1067'></a>
<a id='line_1068'>In the middle of the repast the Earl began to bid Owain welcome.  “Then,”</a>
<a id='line_1069'>said Owain, “behold, it is time for thee to be cheerful.”  “Heaven</a>
<a id='line_1070'>knows,” said the Earl, “that it is not thy coming that makes us</a>
<a id='line_1071'>sorrowful, but we have cause enough for sadness and care.”  “What is</a>
<a id='line_1072'>that?” said Owain.  “I have two sons,” replied the Earl, “and yesterday</a>
<a id='line_1073'>they went to the mountains to hunt.  Now there is on the mountain a</a>
<a id='line_1074'>monster who kills men and devours them, and he seized my sons; and</a>
<a id='line_1075'>to-morrow is the time he has fixed to be here, and he threatens that he</a>
<a id='line_1076'>will then slay my sons before my eyes, unless I will deliver into his</a>
<a id='line_1077'>hands this my daughter.  He has the form of a man, but in stature he is</a>
<a id='line_1078'>no less than a giant.”</a>
<a id='line_1079'></a>
<a id='line_1080'>“Truly,” said Owain, “that is lamentable.  And which wilt thou do?”</a>
<a id='line_1081'>“Heaven knows,” said the Earl, “it will be better that my sons should be</a>
<a id='line_1082'>slain against my will, than that I should voluntarily give up my daughter</a>
<a id='line_1083'>to him to ill-treat and destroy.”  Then they talked about other things,</a>
<a id='line_1084'>and Owain stayed there that night.</a>
<a id='line_1085'></a>
<a id='line_1086'>The next morning they heard an exceeding great clamour, which was caused</a>
<a id='line_1087'>by the coming of the giant with the two youths.  And the Earl was anxious</a>
<a id='line_1088'>both to protect his Castle and to release his two sons.  Then Owain put</a>
<a id='line_1089'>on his armour and went forth to encounter the giant, and the lion</a>
<a id='line_1090'>followed him.  And when the giant saw that Owain was armed, he rushed</a>
<a id='line_1091'>towards him and attacked him.  And the lion fought with the giant much</a>
<a id='line_1092'>more fiercely than Owain did.  “Truly,” said the giant, “I should find no</a>
<a id='line_1093'>difficulty in fighting with thee, were it not for the animal that is with</a>
<a id='line_1094'>thee.”  Upon that Owain took the lion back to the Castle and shut the</a>
<a id='line_1095'>gate upon him, and then he returned to fight the giant, as before.  And</a>
<a id='line_1096'>the lion roared very loud, for he heard that it went hard with Owain.</a>
<a id='line_1097'>And he climbed up till he reached the top of the Earl’s hall, and thence</a>
<a id='line_1098'>he got to the top of the Castle, and he sprang down from the walls and</a>
<a id='line_1099'>went and joined Owain.  And the lion gave the giant a stroke with his</a>
<a id='line_1100'>paw, which tore him from his shoulder to his hip, and his heart was laid</a>
<a id='line_1101'>bare, and the giant fell down dead.  Then Owain restored the two youths</a>
<a id='line_1102'>to their father.</a>
<a id='line_1103'></a>
<a id='line_1104'>The Earl besought Owain to remain with him, and he would not, but set</a>
<a id='line_1105'>forward towards the meadow where Luned was.  And when he came there he</a>
<a id='line_1106'>saw a great fire kindled, and two youths with beautiful curling auburn</a>
<a id='line_1107'>hair were leading the maiden to cast her into the fire.  And Owain asked</a>
<a id='line_1108'>them what charge they had against her.  And they told him of the compact</a>
<a id='line_1109'>that was between them, as the maiden had done the night before.  “And,”</a>
<a id='line_1110'>said they, “Owain has failed her, therefore we are taking her to be</a>
<a id='line_1111'>burnt.”  “Truly,” said Owain, “he is a good knight, and if he knew that</a>
<a id='line_1112'>the maiden was in such peril, I marvel that he came not to her rescue;</a>
<a id='line_1113'>but if you will accept me in his stead, I will do battle with you.”  “We</a>
<a id='line_1114'>will,” said the youths, “by him who made us.”</a>
<a id='line_1115'></a>
<a id='line_1116'>And they attacked Owain, and he was hard beset by them.  And with that</a>
<a id='line_1117'>the lion came to Owain’s assistance, and they two got the better of the</a>
<a id='line_1118'>young men.  And they said to him, “Chieftain, it was not agreed that we</a>
<a id='line_1119'>should fight save with thyself alone, and it is harder for us to contend</a>
<a id='line_1120'>with yonder animal than with thee.”  And Owain put the lion in the place</a>
<a id='line_1121'>where the maiden had been imprisoned, and blocked up the door with</a>
<a id='line_1122'>stones, and he went to fight with the young men, as before.  But Owain</a>
<a id='line_1123'>had not his usual strength, and the two youths pressed hard upon him.</a>
<a id='line_1124'>And the lion roared incessantly at seeing Owain in trouble; and he burst</a>
<a id='line_1125'>through the wall until he found a way out, and rushed upon the young men,</a>
<a id='line_1126'>and instantly slew them.  So Luned was saved from being burned.</a>
<a id='line_1127'></a>
<a id='line_1128'>Then Owain returned with Luned to the dominions of the Countess of the</a>
<a id='line_1129'>Fountain.  And when he went thence he took the Countess with him to</a>
<a id='line_1130'>Arthur’s Court, and she was his wife as long as she lived.</a>
<a id='line_1131'></a>
<a id='line_1132'>                                * * * * *</a>
<a id='line_1133'></a>
<a id='line_1134'>And then he took the road that led to the Court of the savage black man,</a>
<a id='line_1135'>and Owain fought with him, and the lion did not quit Owain until he had</a>
<a id='line_1136'>vanquished him.  And when he reached the Court of the savage black man he</a>
<a id='line_1137'>entered the hall, and beheld four-and-twenty ladies, the fairest that</a>
<a id='line_1138'>could be seen.  And the garments which they had on were not worth</a>
<a id='line_1139'>four-and twenty pence, and they were as sorrowful as death.  And Owain</a>
<a id='line_1140'>asked them the cause of their sadness.  And they said, “We are the</a>
<a id='line_1141'>daughters of Earls, and we all came here with our husbands, whom we</a>
<a id='line_1142'>dearly loved.  And we were received with honour and rejoicing.  And we</a>
<a id='line_1143'>were thrown into a state of stupor, and while we were thus, the demon who</a>
<a id='line_1144'>owns this Castle slew all our husbands, and took from us our horses, and</a>
<a id='line_1145'>our raiment, and our gold, and our silver; and the corpses of our</a>
<a id='line_1146'>husbands are still in this house, and many others with them.  And this,</a>
<a id='line_1147'>Chieftain, is the cause of our grief, and we are sorry that thou art come</a>
<a id='line_1148'>hither, lest harm should befall thee.”</a>
<a id='line_1149'></a>
<a id='line_1150'>And Owain was grieved when he heard this.  And he went forth from the</a>
<a id='line_1151'>Castle, and he beheld a knight approaching him, who saluted him in a</a>
<a id='line_1152'>friendly and cheerful manner, as if he had been a brother.  And this was</a>
<a id='line_1153'>the savage black man.  “In very sooth,” said Owain, “it is not to seek</a>
<a id='line_1154'>thy friendship that I am here.”  “In sooth,” said he, “thou shalt not</a>
<a id='line_1155'>find it then.”  And with that they charged each other, and fought</a>
<a id='line_1156'>furiously.  And Owain overcame him, and bound his hands behind his back.</a>
<a id='line_1157'>Then the black savage besought Owain to spare his life, and spoke thus:</a>
<a id='line_1158'>“My lord Owain,” said he, “it was foretold that thou shouldst come hither</a>
<a id='line_1159'>and vanquish me, and thou hast done so.  I was a robber here, and my</a>
<a id='line_1160'>house was a house of spoil; but grant me my life, and I will become the</a>
<a id='line_1161'>keeper of an Hospice, and I will maintain this house as an Hospice for</a>
<a id='line_1162'>weak and for strong, as long as I live, for the good of thy soul.”  And</a>
<a id='line_1163'>Owain accepted this proposal of him, and remained there that night.</a>
<a id='line_1164'></a>
<a id='line_1165'>And the next day he took the four-and-twenty ladies, and their horses,</a>
<a id='line_1166'>and their raiment, and what they possessed of goods and jewels, and</a>
<a id='line_1167'>proceeded with them to Arthur’s Court.  And if Arthur was rejoiced when</a>
<a id='line_1168'>he saw him, after he had lost him the first time, his joy was now much</a>
<a id='line_1169'>greater.  And of those ladies, such as wished to remain in Arthur’s Court</a>
<a id='line_1170'>remained there, and such as wished to depart departed.</a>
<a id='line_1171'></a>
<a id='line_1172'>And thenceforward Owain dwelt at Arthur’s Court greatly beloved, as the</a>
<a id='line_1173'>head of his household, until he went away with his followers; and those</a>
<a id='line_1174'>were the army of three hundred ravens which Kenverchyn had left him.  And</a>
<a id='line_1175'>wherever Owain went with these he was victorious.</a>
<a id='line_1176'></a>
<a id='line_1177'>And this is the tale of THE LADY OF THE FOUNTAIN.</a>
<a id='line_1178'></a>
<a id='line_1179'></a>
<a id='line_1180'></a>
<a id='line_1181'></a>
<a id='line_1182'>PEREDUR THE SON OF EVRAWC</a>
<a id='line_1183'></a>
<a id='line_1184'></a>
<a id='line_1185'>EARL EVRAWC owned the Earldom of the North.  And he had seven sons.  And</a>
<a id='line_1186'>Evrawc maintained himself not so much by his own possessions as by</a>
<a id='line_1187'>attending tournaments, and wars, and combats.  And, as it often befalls</a>
<a id='line_1188'>those who join in encounters and wars, he was slain, and six of his sons</a>
<a id='line_1189'>likewise.  Now the name of his seventh son was Peredur, and he was the</a>
<a id='line_1190'>youngest of them.  And he was not of an age to go to wars and encounters,</a>
<a id='line_1191'>otherwise he might have been slain as well as his father and brothers.</a>
<a id='line_1192'>His mother was a scheming and thoughtful woman, and she was very</a>
<a id='line_1193'>solicitous concerning this her only son and his possessions.  So she took</a>
<a id='line_1194'>counsel with herself to leave the inhabited country, and to flee to the</a>
<a id='line_1195'>deserts and unfrequented wildernesses.  And she permitted none to bear</a>
<a id='line_1196'>her company thither but women and boys, and spiritless men, who were both</a>
<a id='line_1197'>unaccustomed and unequal to war and fighting.  And none dared to bring</a>
<a id='line_1198'>either horses or arms where her son was, lest he should set his mind upon</a>
<a id='line_1199'>them.  And the youth went daily to divert himself in the forest, by</a>
<a id='line_1200'>flinging sticks and staves.  And one day he saw his mother’s flock of</a>
<a id='line_1201'>goats, and near the goats two hinds were standing.  And he marvelled</a>
<a id='line_1202'>greatly that these two should be without horns, while the others had</a>
<a id='line_1203'>them.  And he thought they had long run wild, and on that account they</a>
<a id='line_1204'>had lost their horns.  And by activity and swiftness of foot, he drove</a>
<a id='line_1205'>the hinds and the goats together into the house which there was for the</a>
<a id='line_1206'>goats at the extremity of the forest.  Then Peredur returned to his</a>
<a id='line_1207'>mother.  “Ah, mother,” said he, “a marvellous thing have I seen in the</a>
<a id='line_1208'>wood; two of thy goats have run wild, and lost their horns, through their</a>
<a id='line_1209'>having been so long missing in the wood.  And no man had ever more</a>
<a id='line_1210'>trouble than I had to drive them in.”  Then they all arose and went to</a>
<a id='line_1211'>see.  And when they beheld the hinds they were greatly astonished.</a>
<a id='line_1212'></a>
<a id='line_1213'>And one day they saw three knights coming along the horse-road on the</a>
<a id='line_1214'>borders of the forest.  And the three knights were Gwalchmai the son of</a>
<a id='line_1215'>Gwyar, and Geneir Gwystyl, and Owain the son of Urien.  And Owain kept on</a>
<a id='line_1216'>the track of the knight who had divided the apples in Arthur’s Court,</a>
<a id='line_1217'>whom they were in pursuit of.  “Mother,” said Peredur, “what are those</a>
<a id='line_1218'>yonder?”  “They are angels, my son,” said she.  “By my faith,” said</a>
<a id='line_1219'>Peredur, “I will go and become an angel with them.”  And Peredur went to</a>
<a id='line_1220'>the road, and met them.  “Tell me, good soul,” said Owain, “sawest thou a</a>
<a id='line_1221'>knight pass this way, either to-day or yesterday?”  “I know not,”</a>
<a id='line_1222'>answered he, “what a knight is.”  “Such an one as I am,” said Owain.  “If</a>
<a id='line_1223'>thou wilt tell me what I ask thee, I will tell thee that which thou</a>
<a id='line_1224'>askest me.”  “Gladly will I do so,” replied Owain.  “What is this?”</a>
<a id='line_1225'>demanded Peredur, concerning the saddle.  “It is a saddle,” said Owain.</a>
<a id='line_1226'>Then he asked about all the accoutrements which he saw upon the men, and</a>
<a id='line_1227'>the horses, and the arms, and what they were for, and how they were used.</a>
<a id='line_1228'>And Owain shewed him all these things fully, and told him what use was</a>
<a id='line_1229'>made of them.  “Go forward,” said Peredur, “for I saw such an one as thou</a>
<a id='line_1230'>inquirest for, and I will follow thee.”</a>
<a id='line_1231'></a>
<a id='line_1232'>Then Peredur returned to his mother and her company, and he said to her,</a>
<a id='line_1233'>“Mother, those were not angels, but honourable knights.”  Then his mother</a>
<a id='line_1234'>swooned away.  And Peredur went to the place where they kept the horses</a>
<a id='line_1235'>that carried firewood, and that brought meat and drink from the inhabited</a>
<a id='line_1236'>country to the desert.  And he took a bony piebald horse, which seemed to</a>
<a id='line_1237'>him the strongest of them.  And he pressed a pack into the form of a</a>
<a id='line_1238'>saddle, and with twisted twigs he imitated the trappings which he had</a>
<a id='line_1239'>seen upon the horses.  And when Peredur came again to his mother, the</a>
<a id='line_1240'>Countess had recovered from her swoon.  “My son,” said she, “desirest</a>
<a id='line_1241'>thou to ride forth?”  “Yes, with thy leave,” said he.  “Wait, then, that</a>
<a id='line_1242'>I may counsel thee before thou goest.”  “Willingly,” he answered; “speak</a>
<a id='line_1243'>quickly.”  “Go forward, then,” she said, “to the Court of Arthur, where</a>
<a id='line_1244'>there are the best, and the boldest, and the most bountiful of men.  And</a>
<a id='line_1245'>wherever thou seest a church, repeat there thy Paternoster unto it.  And</a>
<a id='line_1246'>if thou see meat and drink, and have need of them, and none have the</a>
<a id='line_1247'>kindness or the courtesy to give them to thee, take them thyself.  If</a>
<a id='line_1248'>thou hear an outcry, proceed towards it, especially if it be the outcry</a>
<a id='line_1249'>of a woman.  If thou see a fair jewel, possess thyself of it, and give it</a>
<a id='line_1250'>to another, for thus thou shalt obtain praise.  If thou see a fair woman,</a>
<a id='line_1251'>pay thy court to her, whether she will or no; for thus thou wilt render</a>
<a id='line_1252'>thyself a better and more esteemed man than thou wast before.”</a>
<a id='line_1253'></a>
<a id='line_1254'>After this discourse, Peredur mounted the horse, and taking a handful of</a>
<a id='line_1255'>sharp-pointed forks in his hand, he rode forth.  And he journeyed two</a>
<a id='line_1256'>days and two nights in the woody wildernesses, and in desert places,</a>
<a id='line_1257'>without food and without drink.  And then he came to a vast wild wood,</a>
<a id='line_1258'>and far within the wood he saw a fair even glade, and in the glade he saw</a>
<a id='line_1259'>a tent, and the tent seeming to him to be a church, he repeated his</a>
<a id='line_1260'>Paternoster to it.  And he went towards it, and the door of the tent was</a>
<a id='line_1261'>open.  And a golden chair was near the door.  And on the chair sat a</a>
<a id='line_1262'>lovely auburn-haired maiden, with a golden frontlet on her forehead, and</a>
<a id='line_1263'>sparkling stones in the frontlet, and with a large gold ring on her hand.</a>
<a id='line_1264'>And Peredur dismounted, and entered the tent.  And the maiden was glad at</a>
<a id='line_1265'>his coming, and bade him welcome.  At the entrance of the tent he saw</a>
<a id='line_1266'>food, and two flasks full of wine, and two loaves of fine wheaten flour,</a>
<a id='line_1267'>and collops of the flesh of the wild boar.  “My mother told me,” said</a>
<a id='line_1268'>Peredur, “wheresoever I saw meat and drink, to take it.”  “Take the meat</a>
<a id='line_1269'>and welcome, chieftain,” said she.  So Peredur took half of the meat and</a>
<a id='line_1270'>of the liquor himself, and left the rest to the maiden.  And when Peredur</a>
<a id='line_1271'>had finished eating, he bent upon his knee before the maiden.  “My</a>
<a id='line_1272'>mother,” said he, “told me, wheresoever I saw a fair jewel, to take it.”</a>
<a id='line_1273'>“Do so, my soul,” said she.  So Peredur took the ring.  And he mounted</a>
<a id='line_1274'>his horse, and proceeded on his journey.</a>
<a id='line_1275'></a>
<a id='line_1276'>After this, behold the knight came to whom the tent belonged; and he was</a>
<a id='line_1277'>the Lord of the Glade.  And he saw the track of the horse, and he said to</a>
<a id='line_1278'>the maiden, “Tell me who has been here since I departed.”  “A man,” said</a>
<a id='line_1279'>she, “of wonderful demeanour.”  And she described to him what Peredur’s</a>
<a id='line_1280'>appearance and conduct had been.  “Tell me,” said he, “did he offer thee</a>
<a id='line_1281'>any wrong?”  “No,” answered the maiden, “by my faith, he harmed me not.”</a>
<a id='line_1282'>“By my faith, I do not believe thee; and until I can meet with him, and</a>
<a id='line_1283'>revenge the insult he has done me, and wreak my vengeance upon him, thou</a>
<a id='line_1284'>shalt not remain two nights in the same house.”  And the knight arose,</a>
<a id='line_1285'>and set forth to seek Peredur.</a>
<a id='line_1286'></a>
<a id='line_1287'>Meanwhile Peredur journeyed on towards Arthur’s Court.  And before he</a>
<a id='line_1288'>reached it, another knight had been there, who gave a ring of thick gold</a>
<a id='line_1289'>at the door of the gate for holding his horse, and went into the Hall</a>
<a id='line_1290'>where Arthur and his household, and Gwenhwyvar and her maidens, were</a>
<a id='line_1291'>assembled.  And the page of the chamber was serving Gwenhwyvar with a</a>
<a id='line_1292'>golden goblet.  Then the knight dashed the liquor that was therein upon</a>
<a id='line_1293'>her face, and upon her stomacher, and gave her a violent blow on the</a>
<a id='line_1294'>face, and said, “If any have the boldness to dispute this goblet with me,</a>
<a id='line_1295'>and to revenge the insult to Gwenhwyvar, let him follow me to the meadow,</a>
<a id='line_1296'>and there I will await him.”  So the knight took his horse, and rode to</a>
<a id='line_1297'>the meadow.  And all the household hung down their heads, lest any of</a>
<a id='line_1298'>them should be requested to go and avenge the insult to Gwenhwyvar.  For</a>
<a id='line_1299'>it seemed to them, that no one would have ventured on so daring an</a>
<a id='line_1300'>outrage, unless he possessed such powers, through magic or charms, that</a>
<a id='line_1301'>none could be able to take vengeance upon him.  Then, behold, Peredur</a>
<a id='line_1302'>entered the Hall, upon the bony piebald horse, with the uncouth trappings</a>
<a id='line_1303'>upon it; and in this way he traversed the whole length of the Hall.  In</a>
<a id='line_1304'>the centre of the Hall stood Kai.  “Tell me, tall man,” said Peredur, “is</a>
<a id='line_1305'>that Arthur yonder?”  “What wouldest thou with Arthur?” asked Kai.  “My</a>
<a id='line_1306'>mother told me to go to Arthur, and receive the honour of knighthood.”</a>
<a id='line_1307'>“By my faith,” said he, “thou art all too meanly equipped with horse and</a>
<a id='line_1308'>with arms.”  Thereupon he was perceived by all the household, and they</a>
<a id='line_1309'>threw sticks at him.  Then, behold, a dwarf came forward.  He had already</a>
<a id='line_1310'>been a year at Arthur’s Court, both he and a female dwarf.  They had</a>
<a id='line_1311'>craved harbourage of Arthur, and had obtained it; and during the whole</a>
<a id='line_1312'>year, neither of them had spoken a single word to any one.  When the</a>
<a id='line_1313'>dwarf beheld Peredur, “Haha!” said he, “the welcome of Heaven be unto</a>
<a id='line_1314'>thee, goodly Peredur, son of Evrawc, the chief of warriors, and flower of</a>
<a id='line_1315'>knighthood.”  “Truly,” said Kai, “thou art ill-taught to remain a year</a>
<a id='line_1316'>mute at Arthur’s Court, with choice of society; and now, before the face</a>
<a id='line_1317'>of Arthur and all his household, to call out, and declare such a man as</a>
<a id='line_1318'>this the chief of warriors, and the flower of knighthood.”  And he gave</a>
<a id='line_1319'>him such a box on the ear that he fell senseless to the ground.  Then</a>
<a id='line_1320'>exclaimed the female dwarf, “Haha! goodly Peredur, son of Evrawc; the</a>
<a id='line_1321'>welcome of Heaven be unto thee, flower of knights, and light of</a>
<a id='line_1322'>chivalry.”  “Of a truth, maiden,” said Kai, “thou art ill-bred to remain</a>
<a id='line_1323'>mute for a year at the Court of Arthur, and then to speak as thou dost of</a>
<a id='line_1324'>such a man as this.”  And Kai kicked her with his foot, so that she fell</a>
<a id='line_1325'>to the ground senseless.  “Tall man,” said Peredur, “shew me which is</a>
<a id='line_1326'>Arthur.”  “Hold thy peace,” said Kai, “and go after the knight who went</a>
<a id='line_1327'>hence to the meadow, and take from him the goblet, and overthrow him, and</a>
<a id='line_1328'>possess thyself of his horse and arms, and then thou shalt receive the</a>
<a id='line_1329'>order of knighthood.”  “I will do so, tall man,” said Peredur.  So he</a>
<a id='line_1330'>turned his horse’s head towards the meadow.  And when he came there, the</a>
<a id='line_1331'>knight was riding up and down, proud of his strength, and valour, and</a>
<a id='line_1332'>noble mien.  “Tell me,” said the knight, “didst thou see any one coming</a>
<a id='line_1333'>after me from the Court?”  “The tall man that was there,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_1334'>“desired me to come, and overthrow thee, and to take from thee the</a>
<a id='line_1335'>goblet, and thy horse and thy armour for myself.”  “Silence!” said the</a>
<a id='line_1336'>knight; “go back to the Court, and tell Arthur, from me, either to come</a>
<a id='line_1337'>himself, or to send some other to fight with me; and unless he do so</a>
<a id='line_1338'>quickly, I will not wait for him.”  “By my faith,” said Peredur, “choose</a>
<a id='line_1339'>thou whether it shall be willingly or unwillingly, but I will have the</a>
<a id='line_1340'>horse, and the arms, and the goblet.”  And upon this the knight ran at</a>
<a id='line_1341'>him furiously, and struck him a violent blow with the shaft of his spear,</a>
<a id='line_1342'>between the neck and the shoulder.  “Haha! lad,” said Peredur, “my</a>
<a id='line_1343'>mother’s servants were not used to play with me in this wise; therefore,</a>
<a id='line_1344'>thus will I play with thee.”  And thereupon he struck him with a</a>
<a id='line_1345'>sharp-pointed fork, and it hit him in the eye, and came out at the back</a>
<a id='line_1346'>of his neck, so that he instantly fell down lifeless.</a>
<a id='line_1347'></a>
<a id='line_1348'>“Verily,” said Owain the son of Urien to Kai, “thou wert ill-advised,</a>
<a id='line_1349'>when thou didst send that madman after the knight.  For one of two things</a>
<a id='line_1350'>must befall him.  He must either be overthrown, or slain.  If he is</a>
<a id='line_1351'>overthrown by the knight, he will be counted by him to be an honourable</a>
<a id='line_1352'>person of the Court, and an eternal disgrace will it be to Arthur and his</a>
<a id='line_1353'>warriors.  And if he is slain, the disgrace will be the same, and</a>
<a id='line_1354'>moreover, his sin will be upon him; therefore will I go to see what has</a>
<a id='line_1355'>befallen him.”  So Owain went to the meadow, and he found Peredur</a>
<a id='line_1356'>dragging the man about.  “What art thou doing thus?” said Owain.  “This</a>
<a id='line_1357'>iron coat,” said Peredur, “will never come from off him; not by my</a>
<a id='line_1358'>efforts, at any rate.”  And Owain unfastened his armour and his clothes.</a>
<a id='line_1359'>“Here, my good soul,” said he, “is a horse and armour better than thine.</a>
<a id='line_1360'>Take them joyfully, and come with me to Arthur, to receive the order of</a>
<a id='line_1361'>knighthood, for thou dost merit it.”  “May I never shew my face again if</a>
<a id='line_1362'>I go,” said Peredur; “but take thou the goblet to Gwenhwyvar, and tell</a>
<a id='line_1363'>Arthur, that wherever I am, I will be his vassal, and will do him what</a>
<a id='line_1364'>profit and service I am able.  And say that I will not come to his Court</a>
<a id='line_1365'>until I have encountered the tall man that is there, to revenge the</a>
<a id='line_1366'>injury he did to the dwarf and dwarfess.”  And Owain went back to the</a>
<a id='line_1367'>Court, and related all these things to Arthur and Gwenhwyvar, and to all</a>
<a id='line_1368'>the household.</a>
<a id='line_1369'></a>
<a id='line_1370'>And Peredur rode forward.  And as he proceeded, behold a knight met him.</a>
<a id='line_1371'>“Whence comest thou?” said the knight.  “I come from Arthur’s Court,”</a>
<a id='line_1372'>said Peredur.  “Art thou one of his men?” asked he.  “Yes, by my faith,”</a>
<a id='line_1373'>he answered.  “A good service, truly, is that of Arthur.”  “Wherefore</a>
<a id='line_1374'>sayest thou so?” said Peredur.  “I will tell thee,” said he; “I have</a>
<a id='line_1375'>always been Arthur’s enemy, and all such of his men as I have ever</a>
<a id='line_1376'>encountered I have slain.”  And without further parlance they fought, and</a>
<a id='line_1377'>it was not long before Peredur brought him to the ground, over his</a>
<a id='line_1378'>horse’s crupper.  Then the knight besought his mercy.  “Mercy thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_1379'>have,” said Peredur, “if thou wilt make oath to me, that thou wilt go to</a>
<a id='line_1380'>Arthur’s Court, and tell him that it was I that overthrew thee, for the</a>
<a id='line_1381'>honour of his service; and say, that I will never come to the Court until</a>
<a id='line_1382'>I have avenged the insult offered to the dwarf and dwarfess.”  The knight</a>
<a id='line_1383'>pledged him his faith of this, and proceeded to the Court of Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_1384'>said as he had promised, and conveyed the threat to Kai.</a>
<a id='line_1385'></a>
<a id='line_1386'>And Peredur rode forward.  And within that week he encountered sixteen</a>
<a id='line_1387'>knights, and overthrew them all shamefully.  And they all went to</a>
<a id='line_1388'>Arthur’s Court, taking with them the same message which the first knight</a>
<a id='line_1389'>had conveyed from Peredur, and the same threat which he had sent to Kai.</a>
<a id='line_1390'>And thereupon Kai was reproved by Arthur; and Kai was greatly grieved</a>
<a id='line_1391'>thereat.</a>
<a id='line_1392'></a>
<a id='line_1393'>And Peredur rode forward.  And he came to a vast and desert wood, on the</a>
<a id='line_1394'>confines of which was a lake.  And on the other side was a fair castle.</a>
<a id='line_1395'>And on the border of the lake he saw a venerable, hoary-headed man,</a>
<a id='line_1396'>sitting upon a velvet cushion, and having a garment of velvet upon him.</a>
<a id='line_1397'>And his attendants were fishing in the lake.  When the hoary-headed man</a>
<a id='line_1398'>beheld Peredur approaching, he arose and went towards the castle.  And</a>
<a id='line_1399'>the old man was lame.  Peredur rode to the palace, and the door was open,</a>
<a id='line_1400'>and he entered the hall.  And there was the hoary-headed man sitting on a</a>
<a id='line_1401'>cushion, and a large blazing fire burning before him.  And the household</a>
<a id='line_1402'>and the company arose to meet Peredur, and disarrayed him.  And the man</a>
<a id='line_1403'>asked the youth to sit on the cushion; and they sat down, and conversed</a>
<a id='line_1404'>together.  When it was time, the tables were laid, and they went to meat.</a>
<a id='line_1405'>And when they had finished their meal, the man inquired of Peredur if he</a>
<a id='line_1406'>knew well how to fight with the sword.  “I know not,” said Peredur, “but</a>
<a id='line_1407'>were I to be taught, doubtless I should.”  “Whoever can play well with</a>
<a id='line_1408'>the cudgel and shield, will also be able to fight with a sword.”  And the</a>
<a id='line_1409'>man had two sons; the one had yellow hair, and the other auburn.  “Arise,</a>
<a id='line_1410'>youths,” said he, “and play with the cudgel and the shield.”  And so did</a>
<a id='line_1411'>they.  “Tell me, my soul,” said the man, “which of the youths thinkest</a>
<a id='line_1412'>thou plays best.”  “I think,” said Peredur, “that the yellow-haired youth</a>
<a id='line_1413'>could draw blood from the other, if he chose.”  “Arise thou, my life, and</a>
<a id='line_1414'>take the cudgel and the shield from the hand of the youth with the auburn</a>
<a id='line_1415'>hair, and draw blood from the yellow-haired youth if thou canst.”  So</a>
<a id='line_1416'>Peredur arose, and went to play with the yellow-haired youth; and he</a>
<a id='line_1417'>lifted up his arm, and struck him such a mighty blow, that his brow fell</a>
<a id='line_1418'>over his eye, and the blood flowed forth.  “Ah, my life,” said the man,</a>
<a id='line_1419'>“come now, and sit down, for thou wilt become the best fighter with the</a>
<a id='line_1420'>sword of any in this island; and I am thy uncle, thy mother’s brother.</a>
<a id='line_1421'>And with me shalt thou remain a space, in order to learn the manners and</a>
<a id='line_1422'>customs of different countries, and courtesy, and gentleness, and noble</a>
<a id='line_1423'>bearing.  Leave, then, the habits and the discourse of thy mother, and I</a>
<a id='line_1424'>will be thy teacher; and I will raise thee to the rank of knight from</a>
<a id='line_1425'>this time forward.  And thus do thou.  If thou seest aught to cause thee</a>
<a id='line_1426'>wonder, ask not the meaning of it; if no one has the courtesy to inform</a>
<a id='line_1427'>thee, the reproach will not fall upon thee, but upon me that am thy</a>
<a id='line_1428'>teacher.”  And they had abundance of honour and service.  And when it was</a>
<a id='line_1429'>time they went to sleep.  At the break of day, Peredur arose, and took</a>
<a id='line_1430'>his horse, and with his uncle’s permission he rode forth.  And he came to</a>
<a id='line_1431'>a vast desert wood, and at the further end of the wood was a meadow, and</a>
<a id='line_1432'>on the other side of the meadow he saw a large castle.  And thitherward</a>
<a id='line_1433'>Peredur bent his way, and he found the gate open, and he proceeded to the</a>
<a id='line_1434'>hall.  And he beheld a stately hoary-headed man sitting on one side of</a>
<a id='line_1435'>the hall, and many pages around him, who arose to receive and to honour</a>
<a id='line_1436'>Peredur.  And they placed him by the side of the owner of the palace.</a>
<a id='line_1437'>Then they discoursed together; and when it was time to eat, they caused</a>
<a id='line_1438'>Peredur to sit beside the nobleman during the repast.  And when they had</a>
<a id='line_1439'>eaten and drunk as much as they desired, the nobleman asked Peredur</a>
<a id='line_1440'>whether he could fight with a sword?  “Were I to receive instruction,”</a>
<a id='line_1441'>said Peredur, “I think I could.”  Now, there was on the floor of the hall</a>
<a id='line_1442'>a huge staple, as large as a warrior could grasp.  “Take yonder sword,”</a>
<a id='line_1443'>said the man to Peredur, “and strike the iron staple.”  So Peredur arose</a>
<a id='line_1444'>and struck the staple, so that he cut it in two; and the sword broke into</a>
<a id='line_1445'>two parts also.  “Place the two parts together, and reunite them,” and</a>
<a id='line_1446'>Peredur placed them together, and they became entire as they were before.</a>
<a id='line_1447'>And a second time he struck upon the staple, so that both it and the</a>
<a id='line_1448'>sword broke in two, and as before they reunited.  And the third time he</a>
<a id='line_1449'>gave a like blow, and placed the broken parts together, and neither the</a>
<a id='line_1450'>staple nor the sword would unite as before.  “Youth,” said the nobleman,</a>
<a id='line_1451'>“come now, and sit down, and my blessing be upon thee.  Thou fightest</a>
<a id='line_1452'>best with the sword of any man in the kingdom.  Thou hast arrived at</a>
<a id='line_1453'>two-thirds of thy strength, and the other third thou hast not yet</a>
<a id='line_1454'>obtained; and when thou attainest to thy full power, none will be able to</a>
<a id='line_1455'>contend with thee.  I am thy uncle, thy mother’s brother, and I am</a>
<a id='line_1456'>brother to the man in whose house thou wast last night.”  Then Peredur</a>
<a id='line_1457'>and his uncle discoursed together, and he beheld two youths enter the</a>
<a id='line_1458'>hall, and proceed up to the chamber, bearing a spear of mighty size, with</a>
<a id='line_1459'>three streams of blood flowing from the point to the ground.  And when</a>
<a id='line_1460'>all the company saw this, they began wailing and lamenting.  But for all</a>
<a id='line_1461'>that, the man did not break off his discourse with Peredur.  And as he</a>
<a id='line_1462'>did not tell Peredur the meaning of what he saw, he forbore to ask him</a>
<a id='line_1463'>concerning it.  And when the clamour had a little subsided, behold two</a>
<a id='line_1464'>maidens entered, with a large salver between them, in which was a man’s</a>
<a id='line_1465'>head, surrounded by a profusion of blood.  And thereupon the company of</a>
<a id='line_1466'>the court made so great an outcry, that it was irksome to be in the same</a>
<a id='line_1467'>hall with them.  But at length they were silent.  And when time was that</a>
<a id='line_1468'>they should sleep, Peredur was brought into a fair chamber.</a>
<a id='line_1469'></a>
<a id='line_1470'>And the next day, with his uncle’s permission, he rode forth.  And he</a>
<a id='line_1471'>came to a wood, and far within the wood he heard a loud cry, and he saw a</a>
<a id='line_1472'>beautiful woman with auburn hair, and a horse with a saddle upon it,</a>
<a id='line_1473'>standing near her, and a corpse by her side.  And as she strove to place</a>
<a id='line_1474'>the corpse upon the horse, it fell to the ground, and thereupon she made</a>
<a id='line_1475'>a great lamentation.  “Tell me, sister,” said Peredur, “wherefore art</a>
<a id='line_1476'>thou bewailing?”  “Oh! accursed Peredur, little pity has my ill-fortune</a>
<a id='line_1477'>ever met with from thee.”  “Wherefore,” said Peredur, “am I accursed?”</a>
<a id='line_1478'>“Because thou wast the cause of thy mother’s death; for when thou didst</a>
<a id='line_1479'>ride forth against her will, anguish seized upon her heart, so that she</a>
<a id='line_1480'>died; and therefore art thou accursed.  And the dwarf and the dwarfess</a>
<a id='line_1481'>that thou sawest at Arthur’s Court were the dwarfs of thy father and</a>
<a id='line_1482'>mother; and I am thy foster-sister, and this was my wedded husband, and</a>
<a id='line_1483'>he was slain by the knight that is in the glade in the wood; and do not</a>
<a id='line_1484'>thou go near him, lest thou shouldest be slain by him likewise.”  “My</a>
<a id='line_1485'>sister, thou dost reproach me wrongfully; through my having so long</a>
<a id='line_1486'>remained amongst you, I shall scarcely vanquish him; and had I continued</a>
<a id='line_1487'>longer, it would, indeed, be difficult for me to succeed.  Cease,</a>
<a id='line_1488'>therefore, thy lamenting, for it is of no avail, and I will bury the</a>
<a id='line_1489'>body, and then I will go in quest of the knight, and see if I can do</a>
<a id='line_1490'>vengeance upon him.”  And when he had buried the body, they went to the</a>
<a id='line_1491'>place where the knight was, and found him riding proudly along the glade;</a>
<a id='line_1492'>and he inquired of Peredur whence he came.  “I come from Arthur’s Court.”</a>
<a id='line_1493'>“And art thou one of Arthur’s men?”  “Yes, by my faith.”  “A profitable</a>
<a id='line_1494'>alliance, truly, is that of Arthur.”  And without further parlance, they</a>
<a id='line_1495'>encountered one another, and immediately Peredur overthrew the knight,</a>
<a id='line_1496'>and he besought mercy of Peredur.  “Mercy shalt thou have,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_1497'>“upon these terms, that thou take this woman in marriage, and do her all</a>
<a id='line_1498'>the honour and reverence in thy power, seeing thou hast, without cause,</a>
<a id='line_1499'>slain her wedded husband; and that thou go to Arthur’s Court, and shew</a>
<a id='line_1500'>him that it was I that overthrew thee, to do him honour and service; and</a>
<a id='line_1501'>that thou tell him that I will never come to his Court again until I have</a>
<a id='line_1502'>met with the tall man that is there, to take vengeance upon him for his</a>
<a id='line_1503'>insult to the dwarf and dwarfess.”  And he took the knight’s assurance,</a>
<a id='line_1504'>that he would perform all this.  Then the knight provided the lady with a</a>
<a id='line_1505'>horse and garments that were suitable for her, and took her with him to</a>
<a id='line_1506'>Arthur’s Court.  And he told Arthur all that had occurred, and gave the</a>
<a id='line_1507'>defiance to Kai.  And Arthur and all his household reproved Kai, for</a>
<a id='line_1508'>having driven such a youth as Peredur from his Court.</a>
<a id='line_1509'></a>
<a id='line_1510'>Said Owain the son of Urien, “This youth will never come into the Court</a>
<a id='line_1511'>until Kai has gone forth from it.”  “By my faith,” said Arthur, “I will</a>
<a id='line_1512'>search all the deserts in the Island of Britain, until I find Peredur,</a>
<a id='line_1513'>and then let him and his adversary do their utmost to each other.”</a>
<a id='line_1514'></a>
<a id='line_1515'>Then Peredur rode forward.  And he came to a desert wood, where he saw</a>
<a id='line_1516'>not the track either of men or animals, and where there was nothing but</a>
<a id='line_1517'>bushes and weeds.  And at the upper end of the wood he saw a vast castle,</a>
<a id='line_1518'>wherein were many strong towers; and when he came near the gate, he found</a>
<a id='line_1519'>the weeds taller than he had seen them elsewhere.  And he struck the gate</a>
<a id='line_1520'>with the shaft of his lance, and thereupon behold a lean, auburn-haired</a>
<a id='line_1521'>youth came to an opening in the battlements.  “Choose thou, chieftain,”</a>
<a id='line_1522'>said he, “whether shall I open the gate unto thee, or shall I announce</a>
<a id='line_1523'>unto those that are chief, that thou art at the gateway?”  “Say that I am</a>
<a id='line_1524'>here,” said Peredur, “and if it is desired that I should enter, I will go</a>
<a id='line_1525'>in.”  And the youth came back, and opened the gate for Peredur.  And when</a>
<a id='line_1526'>he went into the hall, he beheld eighteen youths, lean and red-headed, of</a>
<a id='line_1527'>the same height, and of the same aspect, and of the same dress, and of</a>
<a id='line_1528'>the same age as the one who had opened the gate for him.  And they were</a>
<a id='line_1529'>well skilled in courtesy and in service.  And they disarrayed him.  Then</a>
<a id='line_1530'>they sat down to discourse.  Thereupon, behold five maidens came from the</a>
<a id='line_1531'>chamber into the hall.  And Peredur was certain that he had never seen</a>
<a id='line_1532'>another of so fair an aspect as the chief of the maidens.  And she had an</a>
<a id='line_1533'>old garment of satin upon her, which had once been handsome, but was then</a>
<a id='line_1534'>so tattered, that her skin could be seen through it.  And whiter was her</a>
<a id='line_1535'>skin than the bloom of crystal, and her hair and her two eyebrows were</a>
<a id='line_1536'>blacker than jet, and on her cheeks were two red spots, redder than</a>
<a id='line_1537'>whatever is reddest.  And the maiden welcomed Peredur, and put her arms</a>
<a id='line_1538'>about his neck, and made him sit down beside her.  Not long after this he</a>
<a id='line_1539'>saw two nuns enter, and a flask full of wine was borne by one, and six</a>
<a id='line_1540'>loaves of white bread by the other.  “Lady,” said they, “Heaven is</a>
<a id='line_1541'>witness, that there is not so much of food and liquor as this left in</a>
<a id='line_1542'>yonder Convent this night.”  Then they went to meat, and Peredur observed</a>
<a id='line_1543'>that the maiden wished to give more of the food and of the liquor to him</a>
<a id='line_1544'>than to any of the others.  “My sister,” said Peredur, “I will share out</a>
<a id='line_1545'>the food and the liquor.”  “Not so, my soul,” said she.  “By my faith but</a>
<a id='line_1546'>I will.”  So Peredur took the bread, and he gave an equal portion of it</a>
<a id='line_1547'>to each alike, as well as a cup full of the liquor.  And when it was time</a>
<a id='line_1548'>for them to sleep, a chamber was prepared for Peredur, and he went to</a>
<a id='line_1549'>rest.</a>
<a id='line_1550'></a>
<a id='line_1551'>“Behold, sister,” said the youths to the fairest and most exalted of the</a>
<a id='line_1552'>maidens, “we have counsel for thee.”  “What may it be?” she inquired.</a>
<a id='line_1553'>“Go to the youth that is in the upper chamber, and offer to become his</a>
<a id='line_1554'>wife, or the lady of his love, if it seem well to him.”  “That were</a>
<a id='line_1555'>indeed unfitting,” said she.  “Hitherto I have not been the lady-love of</a>
<a id='line_1556'>any knight, and to make him such an offer before I am wooed by him, that,</a>
<a id='line_1557'>truly, can I not do.”  “By our confession to Heaven, unless thou actest</a>
<a id='line_1558'>thus, we will leave thee here to thy enemies, to do as they will with</a>
<a id='line_1559'>thee.”  And through fear of this, the maiden went forth; and shedding</a>
<a id='line_1560'>tears, she proceeded to the chamber.  And with the noise of the door</a>
<a id='line_1561'>opening, Peredur awoke; and the maiden was weeping and lamenting.  “Tell</a>
<a id='line_1562'>me, my sister,” said Peredur, “wherefore dost thou weep?”  “I will tell</a>
<a id='line_1563'>thee, lord,” said she.  “My father possessed these dominions as their</a>
<a id='line_1564'>chief, and this palace was his, and with it he held the best earldom in</a>
<a id='line_1565'>the kingdom; then the son of another earl sought me of my father, and I</a>
<a id='line_1566'>was not willing to be given unto him, and my father would not give me</a>
<a id='line_1567'>against my will, either to him or any earl in the world.  And my father</a>
<a id='line_1568'>had no child except myself.  And after my father’s death, these dominions</a>
<a id='line_1569'>came into my own hands, and then was I less willing to accept him than</a>
<a id='line_1570'>before.  So he made war upon me, and conquered all my possessions, except</a>
<a id='line_1571'>this one house.  And through the valour of the men whom thou hast seen,</a>
<a id='line_1572'>who are my foster-brothers, and the strength of the house, it can never</a>
<a id='line_1573'>be taken while food and drink remain.  And now our provisions are</a>
<a id='line_1574'>exhausted; but, as thou hast seen, we have been fed by the nuns, to whom</a>
<a id='line_1575'>the country is free.  And at length they also are without supply of food</a>
<a id='line_1576'>or liquor.  And at no later date than to-morrow, the earl will come</a>
<a id='line_1577'>against this place with all his forces; and if I fall into his power, my</a>
<a id='line_1578'>fate will be no better than to be given over to the grooms of his horses.</a>
<a id='line_1579'>Therefore, lord, I am come to offer to place myself in thy hands, that</a>
<a id='line_1580'>thou mayest succour me, either by taking me hence, or by defending me</a>
<a id='line_1581'>here, whichever may seem best unto thee.”  “Go, my sister,” said he, “and</a>
<a id='line_1582'>sleep; nor will I depart from thee until I do that which thou requirest,</a>
<a id='line_1583'>or prove whether I can assist thee or not.”  The maiden went again to</a>
<a id='line_1584'>rest; and the next morning she came to Peredur, and saluted him.  “Heaven</a>
<a id='line_1585'>prosper thee, my soul, and what tidings dost thou bring?”  “None other,</a>
<a id='line_1586'>than that the earl and all his forces have alighted at the gate, and I</a>
<a id='line_1587'>never beheld any place so covered with tents, and thronged with knights</a>
<a id='line_1588'>challenging others to the combat.”  “Truly,” said Peredur, “let my horse</a>
<a id='line_1589'>be made ready.”  So his horse was accoutred, and he arose and sallied</a>
<a id='line_1590'>forth to the meadow.  And there was a knight riding proudly along the</a>
<a id='line_1591'>meadow, having raised the signal for battle.  And they encountered, and</a>
<a id='line_1592'>Peredur threw the knight over his horse’s crupper to the ground.  And at</a>
<a id='line_1593'>the close of the day, one of the chief knights came to fight with him,</a>
<a id='line_1594'>and he overthrew him also, so that he besought his mercy.  “Who art</a>
<a id='line_1595'>thou?” said Peredur.  “Verily,” said he, “I am Master of the Household to</a>
<a id='line_1596'>the earl.”  “And how much of the countess’s possessions is there in thy</a>
<a id='line_1597'>power?”  “The third part, verily,” answered he.  “Then,” said Peredur,</a>
<a id='line_1598'>“restore to her the third of her possessions in full, and all the profit</a>
<a id='line_1599'>thou hast made by them, and bring meat and drink for a hundred men, with</a>
<a id='line_1600'>their horses and arms, to her court this night.  And thou shalt remain</a>
<a id='line_1601'>her captive, unless she wish to take thy life.”  And this he did</a>
<a id='line_1602'>forthwith.  And that night the maiden was right joyful, and they fared</a>
<a id='line_1603'>plenteously.</a>
<a id='line_1604'></a>
<a id='line_1605'>And the next day Peredur rode forth to the meadow; and that day he</a>
<a id='line_1606'>vanquished a multitude of the host.  And at the close of the day, there</a>
<a id='line_1607'>came a proud and stately knight, and Peredur overthrew him, and he</a>
<a id='line_1608'>besought his mercy.  “Who art thou?” said Peredur.  “I am Steward of the</a>
<a id='line_1609'>Palace,” said he.  “And how much of the maiden’s possessions are under</a>
<a id='line_1610'>thy control?”  “One-third part,” answered he.  “Verily,” said Peredur,</a>
<a id='line_1611'>“thou shalt fully restore to the maiden her possessions, and, moreover,</a>
<a id='line_1612'>thou shalt give her meat and drink for two hundred men, and their horses</a>
<a id='line_1613'>and their arms.  And for thyself, thou shalt be her captive.”  And</a>
<a id='line_1614'>immediately it was so done.</a>
<a id='line_1615'></a>
<a id='line_1616'>And the third day Peredur rode forth to the meadow; and he vanquished</a>
<a id='line_1617'>more that day than on either of the preceding.  And at the close of the</a>
<a id='line_1618'>day, an earl came to encounter him, and he overthrew him, and he besought</a>
<a id='line_1619'>his mercy.  “Who art thou?” said Peredur.  “I am the earl,” said he.  “I</a>
<a id='line_1620'>will not conceal it from thee.”  “Verily,” said Peredur, “thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_1621'>restore the whole of the maiden’s earldom, and shalt give her thine own</a>
<a id='line_1622'>earldom in addition thereto, and meat and drink for three hundred men,</a>
<a id='line_1623'>and their horses and arms, and thou thyself shalt remain in her power.”</a>
<a id='line_1624'>And thus it was fulfilled.  And Peredur tarried three weeks in the</a>
<a id='line_1625'>country, causing tribute and obedience to be paid to the maiden, and the</a>
<a id='line_1626'>government to be placed in her hands.  “With thy leave,” said Peredur, “I</a>
<a id='line_1627'>will go hence.”  “Verily, my brother, desirest thou this?”  “Yes, by my</a>
<a id='line_1628'>faith; and had it not been for love of thee, I should not have been here</a>
<a id='line_1629'>thus long.”  “My soul,” said she, “who art thou?”  “I am Peredur the son</a>
<a id='line_1630'>of Evrawc from the North; and if ever thou art in trouble or in danger,</a>
<a id='line_1631'>acquaint me therewith, and if I can, I will protect thee.”</a>
<a id='line_1632'></a>
<a id='line_1633'>So Peredur rode forth.  And far thence there met him a lady, mounted on a</a>
<a id='line_1634'>horse that was lean, and covered with sweat; and she saluted the youth.</a>
<a id='line_1635'>“Whence comest thou, my sister?”  Then she told him the cause of her</a>
<a id='line_1636'>journey.  Now she was the wife of the Lord of the Glade.  “Behold,” said</a>
<a id='line_1637'>he, “I am the knight through whom thou art in trouble, and he shall</a>
<a id='line_1638'>repent it, who has treated thee thus.”  Thereupon, behold a knight rode</a>
<a id='line_1639'>up, and he inquired of Peredur, if he had seen a knight such as he was</a>
<a id='line_1640'>seeking.  “Hold thy peace,” said Peredur, “I am he whom thou seekest; and</a>
<a id='line_1641'>by my faith, thou deservest ill of thy household for thy treatment of the</a>
<a id='line_1642'>maiden, for she is innocent concerning me.”  So they encountered, and</a>
<a id='line_1643'>they were not long in combat ere Peredur overthrew the knight, and he</a>
<a id='line_1644'>besought his mercy.  “Mercy thou shalt have,” said Peredur, “so thou wilt</a>
<a id='line_1645'>return by the way thou camest, and declare that thou holdest the maiden</a>
<a id='line_1646'>innocent, and so that thou wilt acknowledge unto her the reverse thou</a>
<a id='line_1647'>hast sustained at my hands.”  And the knight plighted him his faith</a>
<a id='line_1648'>thereto.</a>
<a id='line_1649'></a>
<a id='line_1650'>Then Peredur rode forward.  And above him he beheld a castle, and</a>
<a id='line_1651'>thitherward he went.  And he struck upon the gate with his lance, and</a>
<a id='line_1652'>then, behold, a comely auburn-haired youth opened the gate, and he had</a>
<a id='line_1653'>the stature of a warrior, and the years of a boy.  And when Peredur came</a>
<a id='line_1654'>into the hall, there was a tall and stately lady sitting in a chair, and</a>
<a id='line_1655'>many handmaidens around her; and the lady rejoiced at his coming.  And</a>
<a id='line_1656'>when it was time, they went to meat.  And after their repast was</a>
<a id='line_1657'>finished, “It were well for thee, chieftain,” said she, “to go elsewhere</a>
<a id='line_1658'>to sleep.”  “Wherefore can I not sleep here?” said Peredur.  “Nine</a>
<a id='line_1659'>sorceresses are here, my soul, of the sorceresses of Gloucester, and</a>
<a id='line_1660'>their father and their mother are with them; and unless we can make our</a>
<a id='line_1661'>escape before daybreak, we shall be slain; and already they have</a>
<a id='line_1662'>conquered and laid waste all the country, except this one dwelling.”</a>
<a id='line_1663'>“Behold,” said Peredur, “I will remain here to-night, and if you are in</a>
<a id='line_1664'>trouble, I will do you what service I can; but harm shall you not receive</a>
<a id='line_1665'>from me.”  So they went to rest.  And with the break of day, Peredur</a>
<a id='line_1666'>heard a dreadful outcry.  And he hastily arose, and went forth in his</a>
<a id='line_1667'>vest and his doublet, with his sword about his neck, and he saw a</a>
<a id='line_1668'>sorceress overtake one of the watch, who cried out violently.  Peredur</a>
<a id='line_1669'>attacked the sorceress, and struck her upon the head with his sword, so</a>
<a id='line_1670'>that he flattened her helmet and her head-piece like a dish upon her</a>
<a id='line_1671'>head.  “Thy mercy, goodly Peredur, son of Evrawc, and the mercy of</a>
<a id='line_1672'>Heaven.”  “How knowest thou, hag, that I am Peredur?”  “By destiny, and</a>
<a id='line_1673'>the foreknowledge that I should suffer harm from thee.  And thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_1674'>take a horse and armour of me; and with me thou shalt go to learn</a>
<a id='line_1675'>chivalry and the use of thy arms.”  Said Peredur, “Thou shalt have mercy,</a>
<a id='line_1676'>if thou pledge thy faith thou wilt never more injure the dominions of the</a>
<a id='line_1677'>Countess.”  And Peredur took surety of this, and with permission of the</a>
<a id='line_1678'>Countess, he set forth with the sorceress to the palace of the</a>
<a id='line_1679'>sorceresses.  And there he remained for three weeks, and then he made</a>
<a id='line_1680'>choice of a horse and arms, and went his way.</a>
<a id='line_1681'></a>
<a id='line_1682'>And in the evening he entered a valley, and at the head of the valley he</a>
<a id='line_1683'>came to a hermit’s cell, and the hermit welcomed him gladly, and there he</a>
<a id='line_1684'>spent the night.  And in the morning he arose, and when he went forth,</a>
<a id='line_1685'>behold a shower of snow had fallen the night before, and a hawk had</a>
<a id='line_1686'>killed a wild fowl in front of the cell.  And the noise of the horse</a>
<a id='line_1687'>scared the hawk away, and a raven alighted upon the bird.  And Peredur</a>
<a id='line_1688'>stood, and compared the blackness of the raven and the whiteness of the</a>
<a id='line_1689'>snow, and the redness of the blood, to the hair of the lady that best he</a>
<a id='line_1690'>loved, which was blacker than jet, and to her skin which was whiter than</a>
<a id='line_1691'>the snow, and to the two red spots upon her cheeks, which were redder</a>
<a id='line_1692'>than the blood upon the snow appeared to be.</a>
<a id='line_1693'></a>
<a id='line_1694'>Now Arthur and his household were in search of Peredur.  “Know ye,” said</a>
<a id='line_1695'>Arthur, “who is the knight with the long spear that stands by the brook</a>
<a id='line_1696'>up yonder?”  “Lord,” said one of them, “I will go and learn who he is.”</a>
<a id='line_1697'>So the youth came to the place where Peredur was, and asked him what he</a>
<a id='line_1698'>did thus, and who he was.  And from the intensity with which he thought</a>
<a id='line_1699'>upon the lady whom best he loved, he gave him no answer.  Then the youth</a>
<a id='line_1700'>thrust at Peredur with his lance, and Peredur turned upon him, and struck</a>
<a id='line_1701'>him over his horse’s crupper to the ground.  And after this,</a>
<a id='line_1702'>four-and-twenty youths came to him, and he did not answer one more than</a>
<a id='line_1703'>another, but gave the same reception to all, bringing them with one</a>
<a id='line_1704'>single thrust to the ground.  And then came Kai, and spoke to Peredur</a>
<a id='line_1705'>rudely and angrily; and Peredur took him with his lance under the jaw,</a>
<a id='line_1706'>and cast him from him with a thrust, so that he broke his arm and his</a>
<a id='line_1707'>shoulder-blade, and he rode over him one-and-twenty times.  And while he</a>
<a id='line_1708'>lay thus, stunned with the violence of the pain that he had suffered, his</a>
<a id='line_1709'>horse returned back at a wild and prancing pace.  And when the household</a>
<a id='line_1710'>saw the horse come back without his rider, they rode forth in haste to</a>
<a id='line_1711'>the place where the encounter had been.  And when they first came there,</a>
<a id='line_1712'>they thought that Kai was slain; but they found that if he had a skilful</a>
<a id='line_1713'>physician, he yet might live.  And Peredur moved not from his meditation,</a>
<a id='line_1714'>on seeing the concourse that was around Kai.  And Kai was brought to</a>
<a id='line_1715'>Arthur’s tent, and Arthur caused skilful physicians to come to him.  And</a>
<a id='line_1716'>Arthur was grieved that Kai had met with this reverse, for he loved him</a>
<a id='line_1717'>greatly.</a>
<a id='line_1718'></a>
<a id='line_1719'>“Then,” said Gwalchmai, “it is not fitting that any should disturb an</a>
<a id='line_1720'>honourable knight from his thought unadvisedly; for either he is</a>
<a id='line_1721'>pondering some damage that he has sustained, or he is thinking of the</a>
<a id='line_1722'>lady whom best he loves.  And through such ill-advised proceeding,</a>
<a id='line_1723'>perchance this misadventure has befallen him who last met with him.  And</a>
<a id='line_1724'>if it seem well to thee, lord, I will go and see if this knight hath</a>
<a id='line_1725'>changed from his thought; and if he has, I will ask him courteously to</a>
<a id='line_1726'>come and visit thee.”  Then Kai was wroth, and he spoke angry and</a>
<a id='line_1727'>spiteful words.  “Gwalchmai,” said he, “I know that thou wilt bring him</a>
<a id='line_1728'>because he is fatigued.  Little praise and honour, nevertheless, wilt</a>
<a id='line_1729'>thou have from vanquishing a weary knight, who is tired with fighting.</a>
<a id='line_1730'>Yet thus hast thou gained the advantage over many.  And while thy speech</a>
<a id='line_1731'>and thy soft words last, a coat of thin linen were armour sufficient for</a>
<a id='line_1732'>thee, and thou wilt not need to break either lance or sword in fighting</a>
<a id='line_1733'>with the knight in the state he is in.”  Then said Gwalchmai to Kai,</a>
<a id='line_1734'>“Thou mightest use more pleasant words, wert thou so minded: and it</a>
<a id='line_1735'>behoves thee not upon me to wreak thy wrath and thy displeasure.</a>
<a id='line_1736'>Methinks I shall bring the knight hither with me without breaking either</a>
<a id='line_1737'>my arm or my shoulder.”  Then said Arthur to Gwalchmai, “Thou speakest</a>
<a id='line_1738'>like a wise and prudent man; go, and take enough of armour about thee,</a>
<a id='line_1739'>and choose thy horse.”  And Gwalchmai accoutred himself and rode forward</a>
<a id='line_1740'>hastily to the place where Peredur was.</a>
<a id='line_1741'></a>
<a id='line_1742'>And Peredur was resting on the shaft of his spear, pondering the same</a>
<a id='line_1743'>thought, and Gwalchmai came to him without any signs of hostility, and</a>
<a id='line_1744'>said to him, “If I thought that it would be as agreeable to thee as it</a>
<a id='line_1745'>would be to me, I would converse with thee.  I have also a message from</a>
<a id='line_1746'>Arthur unto thee, to pray thee to come and visit him.  And two men have</a>
<a id='line_1747'>been before on this errand.”  “That is true,” said Peredur, “and</a>
<a id='line_1748'>uncourteously they came.  They attacked me, and I was annoyed thereat,</a>
<a id='line_1749'>for it was not pleasing to me to be drawn from the thought that I was in,</a>
<a id='line_1750'>for I was thinking of the lady whom best I love, and thus was she brought</a>
<a id='line_1751'>to my mind:—I was looking upon the snow, and upon the raven, and upon the</a>
<a id='line_1752'>drops of the blood of the bird that the hawk had killed upon the snow.</a>
<a id='line_1753'>And I bethought me that her whiteness was like that of the snow, and that</a>
<a id='line_1754'>the blackness of her hair and her eyebrows like that of the raven, and</a>
<a id='line_1755'>that the two red spots upon her cheeks were like the two drops of blood.”</a>
<a id='line_1756'>Said Gwalchmai, “This was not an ungentle thought, and I should marvel if</a>
<a id='line_1757'>it were pleasant to thee to be drawn from it.”  “Tell me,” said Peredur,</a>
<a id='line_1758'>“is Kai in Arthur’s Court?”  “He is,” said he, “and behold he is the</a>
<a id='line_1759'>knight that fought with thee last; and it would have been better for him</a>
<a id='line_1760'>had he not come, for his arm and his shoulder-blade were broken with the</a>
<a id='line_1761'>fall which he had from thy spear.”  “Verily,” said Peredur, “I am not</a>
<a id='line_1762'>sorry to have thus begun to avenge the insult to the dwarf and dwarfess.”</a>
<a id='line_1763'>Then Gwalchmai marvelled to hear him speak of the dwarf and the dwarfess;</a>
<a id='line_1764'>and he approached him, and threw his arms around his neck, and asked him</a>
<a id='line_1765'>what was his name.  “Peredur the son of Evrawc am I called,” said he;</a>
<a id='line_1766'>“and thou, Who art thou?”  “I am called Gwalchmai,” he replied.  “I am</a>
<a id='line_1767'>right glad to meet with thee,” said Peredur, “for in every country where</a>
<a id='line_1768'>I have been I have heard of thy fame for prowess and uprightness, and I</a>
<a id='line_1769'>solicit thy fellowship.”  “Thou shalt have it, by my faith, and grant me</a>
<a id='line_1770'>thine,” said he, “Gladly will I do so,” answered Peredur.</a>
<a id='line_1771'></a>
<a id='line_1772'>So they rode forth together joyfully towards the place where Arthur was,</a>
<a id='line_1773'>and when Kai saw them coming, he said, “I knew that Gwalchmai needed not</a>
<a id='line_1774'>to fight the knight.  And it is no wonder that he should gain fame; more</a>
<a id='line_1775'>can he do by his fair words than I by the strength of my arm.”  And</a>
<a id='line_1776'>Peredur went with Gwalchmai to his tent, and they took off their armour.</a>
<a id='line_1777'>And Peredur put on garments like those that Gwalchmai wore, and they went</a>
<a id='line_1778'>together unto Arthur, and saluted him.  “Behold, lord,” said Gwalchmai,</a>
<a id='line_1779'>“him whom thou hast sought so long.”  “Welcome unto thee, chieftain,”</a>
<a id='line_1780'>said Arthur.  “With me thou shalt remain; and had I known thy valour had</a>
<a id='line_1781'>been such, thou shouldst not have left me as thou didst; nevertheless,</a>
<a id='line_1782'>this was predicted of thee by the dwarf and the dwarfess, whom Kai</a>
<a id='line_1783'>ill-treated and whom thou hast avenged.”  And hereupon, behold there came</a>
<a id='line_1784'>the Queen and her handmaidens, and Peredur saluted them.  And they were</a>
<a id='line_1785'>rejoiced to see him, and bade him welcome.  And Arthur did him great</a>
<a id='line_1786'>honour and respect, and they returned towards Caerlleon.</a>
<a id='line_1787'></a>
<a id='line_1788'>And the first night Peredur came to Caerlleon to Arthur’s Court, and as</a>
<a id='line_1789'>he walked in the city after his repast, behold, there met him Angharad</a>
<a id='line_1790'>Law Eurawc.  “By my faith, sister,” said Peredur, “thou art a beauteous</a>
<a id='line_1791'>and lovely maiden; and, were it pleasing to thee, I could love thee above</a>
<a id='line_1792'>all women.”  “I pledge my faith,” said she, “that I do not love thee, nor</a>
<a id='line_1793'>will I ever do so.”  “I also pledge my faith,” said Peredur, “that I will</a>
<a id='line_1794'>never speak a word to any Christian again, until thou come to love me</a>
<a id='line_1795'>above all men.”</a>
<a id='line_1796'></a>
<a id='line_1797'>The next day Peredur went forth by the high road, along a mountain-ridge,</a>
<a id='line_1798'>and he saw a valley of a circular form, the confines of which were rocky</a>
<a id='line_1799'>and wooded.  And the flat part of the valley was in meadows, and there</a>
<a id='line_1800'>were fields betwixt the meadows and the wood.  And in the bosom of the</a>
<a id='line_1801'>wood he saw large black houses of uncouth workmanship.  And he</a>
<a id='line_1802'>dismounted, and led his horse towards the wood.  And a little way within</a>
<a id='line_1803'>the wood he saw a rocky ledge, along which the road lay.  And upon the</a>
<a id='line_1804'>ledge was a lion bound by a chain, and sleeping.  And beneath the lion he</a>
<a id='line_1805'>saw a deep pit of immense size, full of the bones of men and animals.</a>
<a id='line_1806'>And Peredur drew his sword and struck the lion, so that he fell into the</a>
<a id='line_1807'>mouth of the pit and hung there by the chain; and with a second blow he</a>
<a id='line_1808'>struck the chain and broke it, and the lion fell into the pit; and</a>
<a id='line_1809'>Peredur led his horse over the rocky ledge, until he came into the</a>
<a id='line_1810'>valley.  And in the centre of the valley he saw a fair castle, and he</a>
<a id='line_1811'>went towards it.  And in the meadow by the castle he beheld a huge grey</a>
<a id='line_1812'>man sitting, who was larger than any man he had ever before seen.  And</a>
<a id='line_1813'>two young pages were shooting the hilts of their daggers, of the bone of</a>
<a id='line_1814'>the sea-horse.  And one of the pages had red hair, and the other auburn.</a>
<a id='line_1815'>And they went before him to the place where the grey man was, and Peredur</a>
<a id='line_1816'>saluted him.  And the grey man said, “Disgrace to the beard of my</a>
<a id='line_1817'>porter.”  Then Peredur understood that the porter was the lion.—And the</a>
<a id='line_1818'>grey man and the pages went together into the castle, and Peredur</a>
<a id='line_1819'>accompanied them; and he found it a fair and noble place.  And they</a>
<a id='line_1820'>proceeded to the hall, and the tables were already laid, and upon them</a>
<a id='line_1821'>was abundance of food and liquor.  And thereupon he saw an aged woman and</a>
<a id='line_1822'>a young woman come from the chamber; and they were the most stately women</a>
<a id='line_1823'>he had ever seen.  Then they washed and went to meat, and the grey man</a>
<a id='line_1824'>sat in the upper seat at the head of the table, and the aged woman next</a>
<a id='line_1825'>to him.  And Peredur and the maiden were placed together, and the two</a>
<a id='line_1826'>young pages served them.  And the maiden gazed sorrowfully upon Peredur,</a>
<a id='line_1827'>and Peredur asked the maiden wherefore she was sad.  “For thee, my soul;</a>
<a id='line_1828'>for, from when I first beheld thee, I have loved thee above all men.  And</a>
<a id='line_1829'>it pains me to know that so gentle a youth as thou should have such a</a>
<a id='line_1830'>doom as awaits thee to-morrow.  Sawest thou the numerous black houses in</a>
<a id='line_1831'>the bosom of the wood?  All these belong to the vassals of the grey man</a>
<a id='line_1832'>yonder, who is my father.  And they are all giants.  And to-morrow they</a>
<a id='line_1833'>will rise up against thee, and will slay thee.  And the Round Valley is</a>
<a id='line_1834'>this valley called.”  “Listen, fair maiden, wilt thou contrive that my</a>
<a id='line_1835'>horse and arms be in the same lodging with me to-night?”  “Gladly will I</a>
<a id='line_1836'>cause it so to be, by Heaven, if I can.”</a>
<a id='line_1837'></a>
<a id='line_1838'>And when it was time for them to sleep rather than to carouse, they went</a>
<a id='line_1839'>to rest.  And the maiden caused Peredur’s horse and arms to be in the</a>
<a id='line_1840'>same lodging with him.  And the next morning Peredur heard a great tumult</a>
<a id='line_1841'>of men and horses around the castle.  And Peredur arose, and armed</a>
<a id='line_1842'>himself and his horse, and went to the meadow.  Then the aged woman and</a>
<a id='line_1843'>the maiden came to the grey man: “Lord,” said they, “take the word of the</a>
<a id='line_1844'>youth, that he will never disclose what he has seen in this place, and we</a>
<a id='line_1845'>will be his sureties that he keep it.”  “I will not do so, by my faith,”</a>
<a id='line_1846'>said the grey man.  So Peredur fought with the host, and towards evening</a>
<a id='line_1847'>he had slain the one-third of them without receiving any hurt himself.</a>
<a id='line_1848'>Then said the aged woman, “Behold, many of thy host have been slain by</a>
<a id='line_1849'>the youth; do thou, therefore, grant him mercy.”  “I will not grant it,</a>
<a id='line_1850'>by my faith,” said he.  And the aged woman and the fair maiden were upon</a>
<a id='line_1851'>the battlements of the castle, looking forth.  And at that juncture,</a>
<a id='line_1852'>Peredur encountered the yellow-haired youth and slew him.  “Lord,” said</a>
<a id='line_1853'>the maiden, “grant the young man mercy.”  “That will I not do, by</a>
<a id='line_1854'>Heaven,” he replied; and thereupon Peredur attacked the auburn-haired</a>
<a id='line_1855'>youth, and slew him likewise.  “It were better that thou hadst accorded</a>
<a id='line_1856'>mercy to the youth before he had slain thy two sons; for now scarcely</a>
<a id='line_1857'>wilt thou thyself escape from him.”  “Go, maiden, and beseech the youth</a>
<a id='line_1858'>to grant mercy unto us, for we yield ourselves into his hands.”  So the</a>
<a id='line_1859'>maiden came to the place where Peredur was, and besought mercy for her</a>
<a id='line_1860'>father, and for all such of his vassals as had escaped alive.  “Thou</a>
<a id='line_1861'>shalt have it, on condition that thy father and all that are under him go</a>
<a id='line_1862'>and render homage to Arthur, and tell him that it was his vassal Peredur</a>
<a id='line_1863'>that did him this service.”  “This will we do willingly, by Heaven.”</a>
<a id='line_1864'>“And you shall also receive baptism; and I will send to Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_1865'>beseech him to bestow this valley upon thee and upon thy heirs after thee</a>
<a id='line_1866'>for ever.”  Then they went in, and the grey man and the tall woman</a>
<a id='line_1867'>saluted Peredur.  And the grey man said unto him, “Since I have possessed</a>
<a id='line_1868'>this valley I have not seen any Christian depart with his life, save</a>
<a id='line_1869'>thyself.  And we will go to do homage to Arthur, and to embrace the faith</a>
<a id='line_1870'>and be baptized.”  Then said Peredur, “To Heaven I render thanks that I</a>
<a id='line_1871'>have not broken my vow to the lady that best I love, which was, that I</a>
<a id='line_1872'>would not speak one word unto any Christian.”</a>
<a id='line_1873'></a>
<a id='line_1874'>That night they tarried there.  And the next day, in the morning, the</a>
<a id='line_1875'>grey man, with his company, set forth to Arthur’s Court; and they did</a>
<a id='line_1876'>homage unto Arthur, and he caused them to be baptized.  And the grey man</a>
<a id='line_1877'>told Arthur that it was Peredur that had vanquished them.  And Arthur</a>
<a id='line_1878'>gave the valley to the grey man and his company, to hold it of him as</a>
<a id='line_1879'>Peredur had besought.  And with Arthur’s permission, the grey man went</a>
<a id='line_1880'>back to the Round Valley.</a>
<a id='line_1881'></a>
<a id='line_1882'>Peredur rode forward next day, and he traversed a vast tract of desert,</a>
<a id='line_1883'>in which no dwellings were.  And at length he came to a habitation, mean</a>
<a id='line_1884'>and small.  And there he heard that there was a serpent that lay upon a</a>
<a id='line_1885'>gold ring, and suffered none to inhabit the country for seven miles</a>
<a id='line_1886'>around.  And Peredur came to the place where he heard the serpent was.</a>
<a id='line_1887'>And angrily, furiously, and desperately fought he with the serpent; and</a>
<a id='line_1888'>at last he killed it, and took away the ring.  And thus he was for a long</a>
<a id='line_1889'>time without speaking a word to any Christian.  And therefrom he lost his</a>
<a id='line_1890'>colour and his aspect, through extreme longing after the Court of Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_1891'>and the society of the lady whom best he loved, and of his companions.</a>
<a id='line_1892'>Then he proceeded forward to Arthur’s Court, and on the road there met</a>
<a id='line_1893'>him Arthur’s household going on a particular errand, with Kai at their</a>
<a id='line_1894'>head.  And Peredur knew them all, but none of the household recognized</a>
<a id='line_1895'>him.  “Whence comest thou, chieftain?” said Kai.  And this he asked him</a>
<a id='line_1896'>twice and three times, and he answered him not.  And Kai thrust him</a>
<a id='line_1897'>through the thigh with his lance.  And lest he should be compelled to</a>
<a id='line_1898'>speak, and to break his vow, he went on without stopping.  “Then,” said</a>
<a id='line_1899'>Gwalchmai, “I declare to Heaven, Kai, that thou hast acted ill in</a>
<a id='line_1900'>committing such an outrage on a youth like this, who cannot speak.”</a>
<a id='line_1901'></a>
<a id='line_1902'>And Gwalchmai returned back to Arthur’s Court.  “Lady,” said he to</a>
<a id='line_1903'>Gwenhwyvar, “seest thou how wicked an outrage Kai has committed upon this</a>
<a id='line_1904'>youth who cannot speak; for Heaven’s sake, and for mine, cause him to</a>
<a id='line_1905'>have medical care before I come back, and I will repay thee the charge.”</a>
<a id='line_1906'></a>
<a id='line_1907'>And before the men returned from their errand, a knight came to the</a>
<a id='line_1908'>meadow beside Arthur’s Palace, to dare some one to the encounter.  And</a>
<a id='line_1909'>his challenge was accepted; and Peredur fought with him, and overthrew</a>
<a id='line_1910'>him.  And for a week he overthrew one knight every day.</a>
<a id='line_1911'></a>
<a id='line_1912'>And one day, Arthur and his household were going to Church, and they</a>
<a id='line_1913'>beheld a knight who had raised the signal for combat.  “Verily,” said</a>
<a id='line_1914'>Arthur, “by the valour of men, I will not go hence until I have my horse</a>
<a id='line_1915'>and my arms to overthrow yonder boor.”  Then went the attendants to fetch</a>
<a id='line_1916'>Arthur’s horse and arms.  And Peredur met the attendants as they were</a>
<a id='line_1917'>going back, and he took the horse and arms from them, and proceeded to</a>
<a id='line_1918'>the meadow; and all those who saw him arise and go to do battle with the</a>
<a id='line_1919'>knight, went upon the tops of the houses, and the mounds, and the high</a>
<a id='line_1920'>places, to behold the combat.  And Peredur beckoned with his hand to the</a>
<a id='line_1921'>knight to commence the fight.  And the knight thrust at him, but he was</a>
<a id='line_1922'>not thereby moved from where he stood.  And Peredur spurred his horse,</a>
<a id='line_1923'>and ran at him wrathfully, furiously, fiercely, desperately, and with</a>
<a id='line_1924'>mighty rage, and he gave him a thrust, deadly-wounding, severe, furious,</a>
<a id='line_1925'>adroit, and strong, under his jaw, and raised him out of his saddle, and</a>
<a id='line_1926'>cast him a long way from him.  And Peredur went back, and left the horse</a>
<a id='line_1927'>and the arms with the attendant as before, and he went on foot to the</a>
<a id='line_1928'>Palace.</a>
<a id='line_1929'></a>
<a id='line_1930'>Then Peredur went by the name of the Dumb Youth.  And behold, Angharad</a>
<a id='line_1931'>Law Eurawc met him.  “I declare to Heaven, chieftain,” said she, “woful</a>
<a id='line_1932'>is it that thou canst not speak; for couldst thou speak, I would love</a>
<a id='line_1933'>thee best of all men; and by my faith, although thou canst not, I do love</a>
<a id='line_1934'>thee above all.”  “Heaven reward thee, my sister,” said Peredur, “by my</a>
<a id='line_1935'>faith I also do love thee.”  Thereupon it was known that he was Peredur.</a>
<a id='line_1936'>And then he held fellowship with Gwalchmai, and Owain the son of Urien,</a>
<a id='line_1937'>and all the household, and he remained in Arthur’s Court.</a>
<a id='line_1938'></a>
<a id='line_1939'>                                * * * * *</a>
<a id='line_1940'></a>
<a id='line_1941'>Arthur was in Caerlleon upon Usk; and he went to hunt, and Peredur went</a>
<a id='line_1942'>with him.  And Peredur let loose his dog upon a hart, and the dog killed</a>
<a id='line_1943'>the hart in a desert place.  And a short space from him he saw signs of a</a>
<a id='line_1944'>dwelling, and towards the dwelling he went, and he beheld a hall, and at</a>
<a id='line_1945'>the door of the hall he found bald swarthy youths playing at chess.  And</a>
<a id='line_1946'>when he entered, he beheld three maidens sitting on a bench, and they</a>
<a id='line_1947'>were all clothed alike, as became persons of high rank.  And he came, and</a>
<a id='line_1948'>sat by them upon the bench; and one of the maidens looked steadfastly</a>
<a id='line_1949'>upon Peredur, and wept.  And Peredur asked her wherefore she was weeping.</a>
<a id='line_1950'>“Through grief, that I should see so fair a youth as thou art, slain.”</a>
<a id='line_1951'>“Who will slay me?” inquired Peredur.  “If thou art so daring as to</a>
<a id='line_1952'>remain here to-night, I will tell thee.”  “How great soever my danger may</a>
<a id='line_1953'>be from remaining here, I will listen unto thee.”  “This Palace is owned</a>
<a id='line_1954'>by him who is my father,” said the maiden, “and he slays every one who</a>
<a id='line_1955'>comes hither without his leave.”  “What sort of a man is thy father, that</a>
<a id='line_1956'>he is able to slay every one thus?”  “A man who does violence and wrong</a>
<a id='line_1957'>unto his neighbours, and who renders justice unto none.”  And hereupon he</a>
<a id='line_1958'>saw the youths arise and clear the chessmen from the board.  And he heard</a>
<a id='line_1959'>a great tumult; and after the tumult there came in a huge black one-eyed</a>
<a id='line_1960'>man, and the maidens arose to meet him.  And they disarrayed him, and he</a>
<a id='line_1961'>went and sat down; and after he had rested and pondered awhile, he looked</a>
<a id='line_1962'>at Peredur, and asked who the knight was.  “Lord,” said one of the</a>
<a id='line_1963'>maidens, “he is the fairest and gentlest youth that ever thou didst see.</a>
<a id='line_1964'>And for the sake of Heaven, and of thine own dignity, have patience with</a>
<a id='line_1965'>him.”  “For thy sake I will have patience, and I will grant him his life</a>
<a id='line_1966'>this night.”  Then Peredur came towards them to the fire, and partook of</a>
<a id='line_1967'>food and liquor, and entered into discourse with the ladies.  And being</a>
<a id='line_1968'>elated with the liquor, he said to the black man, “It is a marvel to me,</a>
<a id='line_1969'>so mighty as thou sayest thou art, who could have put out thine eye.”</a>
<a id='line_1970'>“It is one of my habits,” said the black man, “that whosoever puts to me</a>
<a id='line_1971'>the question which thou hast asked, shall not escape with his life,</a>
<a id='line_1972'>either as a free gift or for a price.”  “Lord,” said the maiden,</a>
<a id='line_1973'>“whatsoever he may say to thee in jest, and through the excitement of</a>
<a id='line_1974'>liquor, make good that which thou saidst and didst promise me just now.”</a>
<a id='line_1975'>“I will do so, gladly, for thy sake,” said he.  “Willingly will I grant</a>
<a id='line_1976'>him his life this night.”  And that night thus they remained.</a>
<a id='line_1977'></a>
<a id='line_1978'>And the next day the black man got up, and put on his armour, and said to</a>
<a id='line_1979'>Peredur, “Arise, man, and suffer death.”  And Peredur said unto him, “Do</a>
<a id='line_1980'>one of two things, black man; if thou wilt fight with me, either throw</a>
<a id='line_1981'>off thy own armour, or give arms to me, that I may encounter thee.”  “Ha,</a>
<a id='line_1982'>man,” said he, “couldst thou fight, if thou hadst arms?  Take, then, what</a>
<a id='line_1983'>arms thou dost choose.”  And thereupon the maiden came to Peredur with</a>
<a id='line_1984'>such arms as pleased him; and he fought with the black man, and forced</a>
<a id='line_1985'>him to crave his mercy.  “Black man, thou shalt have mercy, provided thou</a>
<a id='line_1986'>tell me who thou art, and who put out thine eye.”  “Lord, I will tell</a>
<a id='line_1987'>thee; I lost it in fighting with the Black Serpent of the Carn.  There is</a>
<a id='line_1988'>a mound, which is called the Mound of Mourning; and on the mound there is</a>
<a id='line_1989'>a carn, and in the carn there is a serpent, and on the tail of the</a>
<a id='line_1990'>serpent there is a stone, and the virtues of the stone are such, that</a>
<a id='line_1991'>whosoever should hold it in one hand, in the other he will have as much</a>
<a id='line_1992'>gold as he may desire.  And in fighting with this serpent was it that I</a>
<a id='line_1993'>lost my eye.  And the Black Oppressor am I called.  And for this reason I</a>
<a id='line_1994'>am called the Black Oppressor, that there is not a single man around me</a>
<a id='line_1995'>whom I have not oppressed, and justice have I done unto none.”  “Tell</a>
<a id='line_1996'>me,” said Peredur, “how far is it hence?”  “The same day that thou</a>
<a id='line_1997'>settest forth, thou wilt come to the Palace of the Sons of the King of</a>
<a id='line_1998'>the Tortures.”  “Wherefore are they called thus?”  “The Addanc of the</a>
<a id='line_1999'>Lake slays them once every day.  When thou goest thence, thou wilt come</a>
<a id='line_2000'>to the Court of the Countess of the Achievements.”  “What achievements</a>
<a id='line_2001'>are there?” asked Peredur.  “Three hundred men there are in her</a>
<a id='line_2002'>household, and unto every stranger that comes to the Court, the</a>
<a id='line_2003'>achievements of her household are related.  And this is the manner of</a>
<a id='line_2004'>it,—the three hundred men of the household sit next unto the Lady; and</a>
<a id='line_2005'>that not through disrespect unto the guests, but that they may relate the</a>
<a id='line_2006'>achievements of the household.  And the day that thou goest thence, thou</a>
<a id='line_2007'>wilt reach the Mound of Mourning, and round about the mound there are the</a>
<a id='line_2008'>owners of three hundred tents guarding the serpent.”  “Since thou hast,</a>
<a id='line_2009'>indeed, been an oppressor so long,” said Peredur, “I will cause that thou</a>
<a id='line_2010'>continue so no longer.”  So he slew him.</a>
<a id='line_2011'></a>
<a id='line_2012'>Then the maiden spoke, and began to converse with him.  “If thou wast</a>
<a id='line_2013'>poor when thou camest here, henceforth thou wilt be rich through the</a>
<a id='line_2014'>treasure of the black man whom thou hast slain.  Thou seest the many</a>
<a id='line_2015'>lovely maidens that there are in this Court; thou shalt have her whom</a>
<a id='line_2016'>thou best likest for the lady of thy love.”  “Lady, I came not hither</a>
<a id='line_2017'>from my country to woo; but match yourselves as it liketh you with the</a>
<a id='line_2018'>comely youths I see here; and none of your goods do I desire, for I need</a>
<a id='line_2019'>them not.”  Then Peredur rode forward, and he came to the Palace of the</a>
<a id='line_2020'>Sons of the King of the Tortures; and when he entered the Palace, he saw</a>
<a id='line_2021'>none but women; and they rose up, and were joyful at his coming; and as</a>
<a id='line_2022'>they began to discourse with him, he beheld a charger arrive, with a</a>
<a id='line_2023'>saddle upon it, and a corpse in the saddle.  And one of the women arose,</a>
<a id='line_2024'>and took the corpse from the saddle, and anointed it in a vessel of warm</a>
<a id='line_2025'>water, which was below the door, and placed precious balsam upon it; and</a>
<a id='line_2026'>the man rose up alive, and came to the place where Peredur was, and</a>
<a id='line_2027'>greeted him, and was joyful to see him.  And two other men came in upon</a>
<a id='line_2028'>their saddles, and the maiden treated these two in the same manner as she</a>
<a id='line_2029'>had done the first.  Then Peredur asked the chieftain wherefore it was</a>
<a id='line_2030'>thus.  And they told him, that there was an Addanc in a cave, which slew</a>
<a id='line_2031'>them once every day.  And thus they remained that night.</a>
<a id='line_2032'></a>
<a id='line_2033'>And next morning the youths arose to sally forth, and Peredur besought</a>
<a id='line_2034'>them, for the sake of the ladies of their love, to permit him to go with</a>
<a id='line_2035'>them; but they refused him, saying, “If thou shouldst be slain there,</a>
<a id='line_2036'>thou hast none to bring thee back to life again.”  And they rode forward,</a>
<a id='line_2037'>and Peredur followed after them; and, after they had disappeared out of</a>
<a id='line_2038'>his sight, he came to a mound, whereon sat the fairest lady he had ever</a>
<a id='line_2039'>beheld.  “I know thy quest,” said she; “thou art going to encounter the</a>
<a id='line_2040'>Addanc, and he will slay thee, and that not by courage, but by craft.  He</a>
<a id='line_2041'>has a cave, and at the entrance of the cave there is a stone pillar, and</a>
<a id='line_2042'>he sees every one that enters, and none see him; and from behind the</a>
<a id='line_2043'>pillar he slays every one with a poisonous dart.  And if thou wouldst</a>
<a id='line_2044'>pledge me thy faith to love me above all women, I would give thee a</a>
<a id='line_2045'>stone, by which thou shouldst see him when thou goest in, and he should</a>
<a id='line_2046'>not see thee.”  “I will, by my troth,” said Peredur, “for when first I</a>
<a id='line_2047'>beheld thee I loved thee; and where shall I seek thee?”  “When thou</a>
<a id='line_2048'>seekest me, seek towards India.”  And the maiden vanished, after placing</a>
<a id='line_2049'>the stone in Peredur’s hand.</a>
<a id='line_2050'></a>
<a id='line_2051'>And he came towards a valley, through which ran a river; and the borders</a>
<a id='line_2052'>of the valley were wooded, and on each side of the river were level</a>
<a id='line_2053'>meadows.  And on one side of the river he saw a flock of white sheep, and</a>
<a id='line_2054'>on the other a flock of black sheep.  And whenever one of the white sheep</a>
<a id='line_2055'>bleated, one of the black sheep would cross over and become white; and</a>
<a id='line_2056'>when one of the black sheep bleated, one of the white sheep would cross</a>
<a id='line_2057'>over and become black.  And he saw a tall tree by the side of the river,</a>
<a id='line_2058'>one half of which was in flames from the root to the top, and the other</a>
<a id='line_2059'>half was green and in full leaf.  And nigh thereto he saw a youth sitting</a>
<a id='line_2060'>upon a mound, and two greyhounds, white-breasted and spotted, in leashes,</a>
<a id='line_2061'>lying by his side.  And certain was he that he had never seen a youth of</a>
<a id='line_2062'>so royal a bearing as he.  And in the wood opposite he heard hounds</a>
<a id='line_2063'>raising a herd of deer.  And Peredur saluted the youth, and the youth</a>
<a id='line_2064'>greeted him in return.  And there were three roads leading from the</a>
<a id='line_2065'>mound; two of them were wide roads, and the third was more narrow.  And</a>
<a id='line_2066'>Peredur inquired where the three roads went.  “One of them goes to my</a>
<a id='line_2067'>palace,” said the youth; “and one of two things I counsel thee to do;</a>
<a id='line_2068'>either to proceed to my palace, which is before thee, and where thou wilt</a>
<a id='line_2069'>find my wife, or else to remain here to see the hounds chasing the roused</a>
<a id='line_2070'>deer from the wood to the plain.  And thou shalt see the best greyhounds</a>
<a id='line_2071'>thou didst ever behold, and the boldest in the chase, kill them by the</a>
<a id='line_2072'>water beside us; and when it is time to go to meat, my page will come</a>
<a id='line_2073'>with my horse to meet me, and thou shalt rest in my palace to-night.”</a>
<a id='line_2074'>“Heaven reward thee; but I cannot tarry, for onward must I go.”  “The</a>
<a id='line_2075'>other road leads to the town, which is near here, and wherein food and</a>
<a id='line_2076'>liquor may be bought; and the road which is narrower than the others goes</a>
<a id='line_2077'>towards the cave of the Addanc.”  “With thy permission, young man, I will</a>
<a id='line_2078'>go that way.”</a>
<a id='line_2079'></a>
<a id='line_2080'>And Peredur went towards the cave.  And he took the stone in his left</a>
<a id='line_2081'>hand, and his lance in his right.  And as he went in he perceived the</a>
<a id='line_2082'>Addanc, and he pierced him through with his lance, and cut off his head.</a>
<a id='line_2083'>And as he came from the cave, behold the three companions were at the</a>
<a id='line_2084'>entrance; and they saluted Peredur, and told him that there was a</a>
<a id='line_2085'>prediction that he should slay that monster.  And Peredur gave the head</a>
<a id='line_2086'>to the young men, and they offered him in marriage whichever of the three</a>
<a id='line_2087'>sisters he might choose, and half their kingdom with her.  “I came not</a>
<a id='line_2088'>hither to woo,” said Peredur, “but if peradventure I took a wife, I</a>
<a id='line_2089'>should prefer your sister to all others.”  And Peredur rode forward, and</a>
<a id='line_2090'>he heard a noise behind him.  And he looked back, and saw a man upon a</a>
<a id='line_2091'>red horse, with red armour upon him; and the man rode up by his side, and</a>
<a id='line_2092'>saluted him, and wished him the favour of Heaven and of man.  And Peredur</a>
<a id='line_2093'>greeted the youth kindly.  “Lord, I come to make a request unto thee.”</a>
<a id='line_2094'>“What wouldest thou?”  “That thou shouldest take me as thine attendant.”</a>
<a id='line_2095'>“Whom then should I take as my attendant, if I did so?”  “I will not</a>
<a id='line_2096'>conceal from thee what kindred I am of.  Etlym Gleddyv Coch am I called,</a>
<a id='line_2097'>an Earl from the East Country.”  “I marvel that thou shouldest offer to</a>
<a id='line_2098'>become attendant to a man whose possessions are no greater than thine</a>
<a id='line_2099'>own; for I have but an earldom like thyself.  But since thou desirest to</a>
<a id='line_2100'>be my attendant, I will take thee joyfully.”</a>
<a id='line_2101'></a>
<a id='line_2102'>And they went forward to the Court of the Countess, and all they of the</a>
<a id='line_2103'>Court were glad at their coming; and they were told it was not through</a>
<a id='line_2104'>disrespect they were placed below the household, but that such was the</a>
<a id='line_2105'>usage of the Court.  For, whoever should overthrow the three hundred men</a>
<a id='line_2106'>of her household, would sit next the Countess, and she would love him</a>
<a id='line_2107'>above all men.  And Peredur having overthrown the three hundred men of</a>
<a id='line_2108'>her household, sat down beside her, and the Countess said, “I thank</a>
<a id='line_2109'>Heaven that I have a youth so fair and so valiant as thou, since I have</a>
<a id='line_2110'>not obtained the man whom best I love.”  “Who is he whom best thou</a>
<a id='line_2111'>lovest?”  “By my faith, Etlym Gleddyv Coch is the man whom I love best,</a>
<a id='line_2112'>and I have never seen him.”  “Of a truth, Etlym is my companion; and</a>
<a id='line_2113'>behold here he is, and for his sake did I come to joust with thy</a>
<a id='line_2114'>household.  And he could have done so better than I, had it pleased him.</a>
<a id='line_2115'>And I do give thee unto him.”  “Heaven reward thee, fair youth, and I</a>
<a id='line_2116'>will take the man whom I love above all others.”  And the Countess became</a>
<a id='line_2117'>Etlym’s bride from that moment.</a>
<a id='line_2118'></a>
<a id='line_2119'>And the next day Peredur set forth towards the Mound of Mourning.  “By</a>
<a id='line_2120'>thy hand, lord, but I will go with thee,” said Etlym.  Then they went</a>
<a id='line_2121'>forwards till they came in sight of the mound and the tents.  “Go unto</a>
<a id='line_2122'>yonder men,” said Peredur to Etlym, “and desire them to come and do me</a>
<a id='line_2123'>homage.”  So Etlym went unto them, and said unto them thus,—“Come and do</a>
<a id='line_2124'>homage to my lord.”  “Who is thy lord?” said they.  “Peredur with the</a>
<a id='line_2125'>long lance is my lord,” said Etlym.  “Were it permitted to slay a</a>
<a id='line_2126'>messenger, thou shouldest not go back to thy lord alive, for making unto</a>
<a id='line_2127'>Kings, and Earls, and Barons so arrogant a demand as to go and do him</a>
<a id='line_2128'>homage.”  Peredur desired him to go back to them, and to give them their</a>
<a id='line_2129'>choice, either to do him homage, or to do battle with him.  And they</a>
<a id='line_2130'>chose rather to do battle.  And that day Peredur overthrew the owners of</a>
<a id='line_2131'>a hundred tents; and the next day he overthrew the owners of a hundred</a>
<a id='line_2132'>more; and the third day the remaining hundred took counsel to do homage</a>
<a id='line_2133'>to Peredur.  And Peredur inquired of them, wherefore they were there.</a>
<a id='line_2134'>And they told him they were guarding the serpent until he should die.</a>
<a id='line_2135'>“For then should we fight for the stone among ourselves, and whoever</a>
<a id='line_2136'>should be conqueror among us would have the stone.”  “Await here,” said</a>
<a id='line_2137'>Peredur, “and I will go to encounter the serpent.”  “Not so, lord,” said</a>
<a id='line_2138'>they; “we will go altogether to encounter the serpent.”  “Verily,” said</a>
<a id='line_2139'>Peredur, “that will I not permit; for if the serpent be slain, I shall</a>
<a id='line_2140'>derive no more fame therefrom than one of you.”  Then he went to the</a>
<a id='line_2141'>place where the serpent was, and slew it, and came back to them, and</a>
<a id='line_2142'>said, “Reckon up what you have spent since you have been here, and I will</a>
<a id='line_2143'>repay you to the full.”  And he paid to each what he said was his claim.</a>
<a id='line_2144'>And he required of them only that they should acknowledge themselves his</a>
<a id='line_2145'>vassals.  And he said to Etlym, “Go back unto her whom thou lovest best,</a>
<a id='line_2146'>and I will go forwards, and I will reward thee for having been my</a>
<a id='line_2147'>attendant.”  And he gave Etlym the stone.  “Heaven repay thee and prosper</a>
<a id='line_2148'>thee,” said Etlym.</a>
<a id='line_2149'></a>
<a id='line_2150'>And Peredur rode thence, and he came to the fairest valley he had ever</a>
<a id='line_2151'>seen, through which ran a river; and there he beheld many tents of</a>
<a id='line_2152'>various colours.  And he marvelled still more at the number of</a>
<a id='line_2153'>water-mills and of wind-mills that he saw.  And there rode up with him a</a>
<a id='line_2154'>tall auburn-haired man, in workman’s garb, and Peredur inquired of him</a>
<a id='line_2155'>who he was.  “I am the chief miller,” said he, “of all the mills yonder.”</a>
<a id='line_2156'>“Wilt thou give me lodging?” said Peredur.  “I will, gladly,” he</a>
<a id='line_2157'>answered.  And Peredur came to the miller’s house, and the miller had a</a>
<a id='line_2158'>fair and pleasant dwelling.  And Peredur asked money as a loan from the</a>
<a id='line_2159'>miller, that he might buy meat and liquor for himself and for the</a>
<a id='line_2160'>household, and he promised that he would pay him again ere he went</a>
<a id='line_2161'>thence.  And he inquired of the miller, wherefore such a multitude was</a>
<a id='line_2162'>there assembled.  Said the miller to Peredur, “One thing is certain:</a>
<a id='line_2163'>either thou art a man from afar, or thou art beside thyself.  The Empress</a>
<a id='line_2164'>of Cristinobyl the Great is here; and she will have no one but the man</a>
<a id='line_2165'>who is most valiant; for riches does she not require.  And it was</a>
<a id='line_2166'>impossible to bring food for so many thousands as are here, therefore</a>
<a id='line_2167'>were all these mills constructed.”  And that night they took their rest.</a>
<a id='line_2168'></a>
<a id='line_2169'>And the next day Peredur arose, and he equipped himself and his horse for</a>
<a id='line_2170'>the tournament.  And among the other tents he beheld one, which was the</a>
<a id='line_2171'>fairest he had ever seen.  And he saw a beauteous maiden leaning her head</a>
<a id='line_2172'>out of a window of the tent, and he had never seen a maiden more lovely</a>
<a id='line_2173'>than she.  And upon her was a garment of satin.  And he gazed fixedly on</a>
<a id='line_2174'>the maiden, and began to love her greatly.  And he remained there, gazing</a>
<a id='line_2175'>upon the maiden from morning until mid-day, and from mid-day until</a>
<a id='line_2176'>evening; and then the tournament was ended and he went to his lodging and</a>
<a id='line_2177'>drew off his armour.  Then he asked money of the miller as a loan, and</a>
<a id='line_2178'>the miller’s wife was wroth with Peredur; nevertheless, the miller lent</a>
<a id='line_2179'>him the money.  And the next day he did in like manner as he had done the</a>
<a id='line_2180'>day before.  And at night he came to his lodging, and took money as a</a>
<a id='line_2181'>loan from the miller.  And the third day, as he was in the same place,</a>
<a id='line_2182'>gazing upon the maiden, he felt a hard blow between the neck and the</a>
<a id='line_2183'>shoulder, from the edge of an axe.  And when he looked behind him, he saw</a>
<a id='line_2184'>that it was the miller; and the miller said to him, “Do one of two</a>
<a id='line_2185'>things: either turn thy head from hence, or go to the tournament.”  And</a>
<a id='line_2186'>Peredur smiled on the miller, and went to the tournament; and all that</a>
<a id='line_2187'>encountered him that day he overthrew.  And as many as he vanquished he</a>
<a id='line_2188'>sent as a gift to the Empress, and their horses and arms he sent as a</a>
<a id='line_2189'>gift to the wife of the miller, in payment of the borrowed money.</a>
<a id='line_2190'>Peredur attended the tournament until all were overthrown, and he sent</a>
<a id='line_2191'>all the men to the prison of the Empress, and the horses and arms to the</a>
<a id='line_2192'>wife of the miller, in payment of the borrowed money.  And the Empress</a>
<a id='line_2193'>sent to the Knight of the Mill, to ask him to come and visit her.  And</a>
<a id='line_2194'>Peredur went not for the first nor for the second message.  And the third</a>
<a id='line_2195'>time she sent a hundred knights to bring him against his will, and they</a>
<a id='line_2196'>went to him and told him their mission from the Empress.  And Peredur</a>
<a id='line_2197'>fought well with them, and caused them to be bound like stags, and thrown</a>
<a id='line_2198'>into the mill-dyke.  And the Empress sought advice of a wise man who was</a>
<a id='line_2199'>in her counsel; and he said to her, “With thy permission, I will go to</a>
<a id='line_2200'>him myself.”  So he came to Peredur, and saluted him, and besought him,</a>
<a id='line_2201'>for the sake of the lady of his love, to come and visit the Empress.  And</a>
<a id='line_2202'>they went, together with the miller.  And Peredur went and sat down in</a>
<a id='line_2203'>the outer chamber of the tent, and she came and placed herself by his</a>
<a id='line_2204'>side.  And there was but little discourse between them.  And Peredur took</a>
<a id='line_2205'>his leave, and went to his lodging.</a>
<a id='line_2206'></a>
<a id='line_2207'>And the next day he came to visit her, and when he came into the tent</a>
<a id='line_2208'>there was no one chamber less decorated than the others.  And they knew</a>
<a id='line_2209'>not where he would sit.  And Peredur went and sat beside the Empress, and</a>
<a id='line_2210'>discoursed with her courteously.  And while they were thus, they beheld a</a>
<a id='line_2211'>black man enter with a goblet full of wine in his hand.  And he dropped</a>
<a id='line_2212'>upon his knee before the Empress, and besought her to give it to no one</a>
<a id='line_2213'>who would not fight with him for it.  And she looked upon Peredur.</a>
<a id='line_2214'>“Lady,” said he, “bestow on me the goblet.”  And Peredur drank the wine,</a>
<a id='line_2215'>and gave the goblet to the miller’s wife.  And while they were thus,</a>
<a id='line_2216'>behold there entered a black man of larger stature than the other, with a</a>
<a id='line_2217'>wild beast’s claw in his hand, wrought into the form of a goblet and</a>
<a id='line_2218'>filled with wine.  And he presented it to the Empress, and besought her</a>
<a id='line_2219'>to give it to no one but the man who would fight with him.  “Lady,” said</a>
<a id='line_2220'>Peredur, “bestow it on me.”  And she gave it to him.  And Peredur drank</a>
<a id='line_2221'>the wine, and sent the goblet to the wife of the miller.  And while they</a>
<a id='line_2222'>were thus, behold a rough-looking, crisp-haired man, taller than either</a>
<a id='line_2223'>of the others, came in with a bowl in his hand full of wine; and he bent</a>
<a id='line_2224'>upon his knee, and gave it into the hands of the Empress, and he besought</a>
<a id='line_2225'>her to give it to none but him who would fight with him for it; and she</a>
<a id='line_2226'>gave it to Peredur, and he sent it to the miller’s wife.  And that night</a>
<a id='line_2227'>Peredur returned to his lodging; and the next day he accoutred himself</a>
<a id='line_2228'>and his horse, and went to the meadow and slew the three men.  Then</a>
<a id='line_2229'>Peredur proceeded to the tent, and the Empress said to him, “Goodly</a>
<a id='line_2230'>Peredur, remember the faith thou didst pledge me when I gave thee the</a>
<a id='line_2231'>stone, and thou didst kill the Addanc.”  “Lady,” answered he, “thou</a>
<a id='line_2232'>sayest truth, I do remember it.”  And Peredur was entertained by the</a>
<a id='line_2233'>Empress fourteen years, as the story relates.</a>
<a id='line_2234'></a>
<a id='line_2235'>                                * * * * *</a>
<a id='line_2236'></a>
<a id='line_2237'>Arthur was at Caerlleon upon Usk, his principal palace; and in the centre</a>
<a id='line_2238'>of the floor of the hall were four men sitting on a carpet of velvet,</a>
<a id='line_2239'>Owain the son of Urien, and Gwalchmai the son of Gwyar, and Howel the son</a>
<a id='line_2240'>of Emyr Llydaw, and Peredur of the long lance.  And thereupon they saw a</a>
<a id='line_2241'>black curly-headed maiden enter, riding upon a yellow mule, with jagged</a>
<a id='line_2242'>thongs in her hand to urge it on; and having a rough and hideous aspect.</a>
<a id='line_2243'>Blacker were her face and her two hands than the blackest iron covered</a>
<a id='line_2244'>with pitch; and her hue was not more frightful than her form.  High</a>
<a id='line_2245'>cheeks had she, and a face lengthened downwards, and a short nose with</a>
<a id='line_2246'>distended nostrils.  And one eye was of a piercing mottled grey, and the</a>
<a id='line_2247'>other was as black as jet, deep-sunk in her head.  And her teeth were</a>
<a id='line_2248'>long and yellow, more yellow were they than the flower of the broom.  And</a>
<a id='line_2249'>her stomach rose from the breast-bone, higher than her chin.  And her</a>
<a id='line_2250'>back was in the shape of a crook, and her legs were large and bony.  And</a>
<a id='line_2251'>her figure was very thin and spare, except her feet and her legs, which</a>
<a id='line_2252'>were of huge size.  And she greeted Arthur and all his household except</a>
<a id='line_2253'>Peredur.  And to Peredur she spoke harsh and angry words.  “Peredur, I</a>
<a id='line_2254'>greet thee not, seeing that thou dost not merit it.  Blind was fate in</a>
<a id='line_2255'>giving thee fame and favour.  When thou wast in the Court of the Lame</a>
<a id='line_2256'>King, and didst see there the youth bearing the streaming spear, from the</a>
<a id='line_2257'>points of which were drops of blood flowing in streams, even to the hand</a>
<a id='line_2258'>of the youth, and many other wonders likewise, thou didst not inquire</a>
<a id='line_2259'>their meaning nor their cause.  Hadst thou done so, the King would have</a>
<a id='line_2260'>been restored to health, and his dominions to peace.  Whereas from</a>
<a id='line_2261'>henceforth, he will have to endure battles and conflicts, and his knights</a>
<a id='line_2262'>will perish, and wives will be widowed, and maidens will be left</a>
<a id='line_2263'>portionless, and all this is because of thee.”  Then said she unto</a>
<a id='line_2264'>Arthur, “May it please thee, lord, my dwelling is far hence, in the</a>
<a id='line_2265'>stately castle of which thou hast heard, and therein are five hundred and</a>
<a id='line_2266'>sixty-six knights of the order of Chivalry, and the lady whom best he</a>
<a id='line_2267'>loves with each; and whoever would acquire fame in arms, and encounters,</a>
<a id='line_2268'>and conflicts, he will gain it there, if he deserve it.  And whoso would</a>
<a id='line_2269'>reach the summit of fame and of honour, I know where he may find it.</a>
<a id='line_2270'>There is a castle on a lofty mountain, and there is a maiden therein, and</a>
<a id='line_2271'>she is detained a prisoner there, and whoever shall set her free will</a>
<a id='line_2272'>attain the summit of the fame of the world.”  And thereupon she rode</a>
<a id='line_2273'>away.</a>
<a id='line_2274'></a>
<a id='line_2275'>Said Gwalchmai, “By my faith, I will not rest tranquilly until I have</a>
<a id='line_2276'>proved if I can release the maiden.”  And many of Arthur’s household</a>
<a id='line_2277'>joined themselves with him.  Then, likewise, said Peredur, “By my faith,</a>
<a id='line_2278'>I will not rest tranquilly until I know the story and the meaning of the</a>
<a id='line_2279'>lance whereof the black maiden spoke.”  And while they were equipping</a>
<a id='line_2280'>themselves, behold a knight came to the gate.  And he had the size and</a>
<a id='line_2281'>the strength of a warrior, and was equipped with arms and habiliments.</a>
<a id='line_2282'>And he went forward, and saluted Arthur and all his household, except</a>
<a id='line_2283'>Gwalchmai.  And the knight had upon his shoulder a shield, ingrained with</a>
<a id='line_2284'>gold, with a fesse of azure blue upon it, and his whole armour was of the</a>
<a id='line_2285'>same hue.  And he said to Gwalchmai, “Thou didst slay my lord by thy</a>
<a id='line_2286'>treachery and deceit, and that will I prove upon thee.”  Then Gwalchmai</a>
<a id='line_2287'>rose up.  “Behold,” said he, “here is my gage against thee, to maintain,</a>
<a id='line_2288'>either in this place or wherever else thou wilt, that I am not a traitor</a>
<a id='line_2289'>or deceiver.”  “Before the King whom I obey, will I that my encounter</a>
<a id='line_2290'>with thee take place,” said the knight.  “Willingly,” said Gwalchmai; “go</a>
<a id='line_2291'>forward, and I will follow thee.”  So the knight went forth, and</a>
<a id='line_2292'>Gwalchmai accoutred himself, and there was offered unto him abundance of</a>
<a id='line_2293'>armour, but he would take none but his own.  And when Gwalchmai and</a>
<a id='line_2294'>Peredur were equipped, they set forth to follow him, by reason of their</a>
<a id='line_2295'>fellowship and of the great friendship that was between them.  And they</a>
<a id='line_2296'>did not go after him in company together, but each went his own way.</a>
<a id='line_2297'></a>
<a id='line_2298'>At the dawn of day Gwalchmai came to a valley, and in the valley he saw a</a>
<a id='line_2299'>fortress, and within the fortress a vast palace and lofty towers around</a>
<a id='line_2300'>it.  And he beheld a knight coming out to hunt from the other side,</a>
<a id='line_2301'>mounted on a spirited black snorting palfrey, that advanced at a prancing</a>
<a id='line_2302'>pace, proudly stepping, and nimbly bounding, and sure of foot; and this</a>
<a id='line_2303'>was the man to whom the palace belonged.  And Gwalchmai saluted him.</a>
<a id='line_2304'>“Heaven prosper thee, chieftain,” said he, “and whence comest thou?”  “I</a>
<a id='line_2305'>come,” answered Gwalchmai, “from the Court of Arthur.”  “And art thou</a>
<a id='line_2306'>Arthur’s vassal?”  “Yes, by my faith,” said Gwalchmai.  “I will give thee</a>
<a id='line_2307'>good counsel,” said the knight.  “I see that thou art tired and weary; go</a>
<a id='line_2308'>unto my palace, if it may please thee, and tarry there to-night.”</a>
<a id='line_2309'>“Willingly, lord,” said he, “and Heaven reward thee.”  “Take this ring as</a>
<a id='line_2310'>a token to the porter, and go forward to yonder tower, and therein thou</a>
<a id='line_2311'>wilt find my sister.”  And Gwalchmai went to the gate, and showed the</a>
<a id='line_2312'>ring, and proceeded to the tower.  And on entering he beheld a large</a>
<a id='line_2313'>blazing fire, burning without smoke and with a bright and lofty flame,</a>
<a id='line_2314'>and a beauteous and stately maiden was sitting on a chair by the fire.</a>
<a id='line_2315'>And the maiden was glad at his coming, and welcomed him, and advanced to</a>
<a id='line_2316'>meet him.  And he went and sat beside the maiden, and they took their</a>
<a id='line_2317'>repast.  And when their repast was over, they discoursed pleasantly</a>
<a id='line_2318'>together.  And while they were thus, behold there entered a venerable</a>
<a id='line_2319'>hoary-headed man.  “Ah! base girl,” said he, “if thou didst think it was</a>
<a id='line_2320'>right for thee to entertain and to sit by yonder man, thou wouldest not</a>
<a id='line_2321'>do so.”  And he withdrew his head, and went forth.  “Ah! chieftain,” said</a>
<a id='line_2322'>the maiden, “if thou wilt do as I counsel thee, thou wilt shut the door,</a>
<a id='line_2323'>lest the man should have a plot against thee.”  Upon that Gwalchmai</a>
<a id='line_2324'>arose, and when he came near unto the door, the man, with sixty others,</a>
<a id='line_2325'>fully armed, were ascending the tower.  And Gwalchmai defended the door</a>
<a id='line_2326'>with a chessboard, that none might enter until the man should return from</a>
<a id='line_2327'>the chase.  And thereupon, behold the Earl arrived.  “What is all this?”</a>
<a id='line_2328'>asked he.  “It is a sad thing,” said the hoary-headed man; “the young</a>
<a id='line_2329'>girl yonder has been sitting and eating with him who slew your father.</a>
<a id='line_2330'>He is Gwalchmai, the son of Gwyar.”  “Hold thy peace, then,” said the</a>
<a id='line_2331'>Earl, “I will go in.”  And the Earl was joyful concerning Gwalchmai.</a>
<a id='line_2332'>“Ha! chieftain,” said he, “it was wrong of thee to come to my court, when</a>
<a id='line_2333'>thou knewest that thou didst slay my father; and though we cannot avenge</a>
<a id='line_2334'>him, Heaven will avenge him upon thee.”  “My soul,” said Gwalchmai, “thus</a>
<a id='line_2335'>it is: I came not here either to acknowledge or to deny having slain thy</a>
<a id='line_2336'>father; but I am on a message from Arthur, and therefore do I crave the</a>
<a id='line_2337'>space of a year until I shall return from my embassy, and then, upon my</a>
<a id='line_2338'>faith, I will come back unto this palace, and do one of two things,</a>
<a id='line_2339'>either acknowledge it, or deny it.”  And the time was granted him</a>
<a id='line_2340'>willingly; and he remained there that night.  And the next morning he</a>
<a id='line_2341'>rode forth.  And the story relates nothing further of Gwalchmai</a>
<a id='line_2342'>respecting this adventure.</a>
<a id='line_2343'></a>
<a id='line_2344'>And Peredur rode forward.  And he wandered over the whole island, seeking</a>
<a id='line_2345'>tidings of the black maiden, and he could meet with none.  And he came to</a>
<a id='line_2346'>an unknown land, in the centre of a valley, watered by a river.  And as</a>
<a id='line_2347'>he traversed the valley he beheld a horseman coming towards him, and</a>
<a id='line_2348'>wearing the garments of a priest; and he besought his blessing.</a>
<a id='line_2349'>“Wretched man,” said he, “thou meritest no blessing, and thou wouldest</a>
<a id='line_2350'>not be profited by one, seeing that thou art clad in armour on such a day</a>
<a id='line_2351'>as this.”  “And what day is to-day?” said Peredur.  “To-day is Good</a>
<a id='line_2352'>Friday,” he answered.  “Chide me not that I knew not this, seeing that it</a>
<a id='line_2353'>is a year to-day since I journeyed forth from my country.”  Then he</a>
<a id='line_2354'>dismounted, and led his horse in his hand.  And he had not proceeded far</a>
<a id='line_2355'>along the high road before he came to a cross road, and the cross road</a>
<a id='line_2356'>traversed a wood.  And on the other side of the wood he saw an</a>
<a id='line_2357'>unfortified castle, which appeared to be inhabited.  And at the gate of</a>
<a id='line_2358'>the castle there met him the priest whom he had seen before, and he asked</a>
<a id='line_2359'>his blessing.  “The blessing of Heaven be unto thee,” said he, “it is</a>
<a id='line_2360'>more fitting to travel in thy present guise than as thou wast erewhile;</a>
<a id='line_2361'>and this night thou shalt tarry with me.”  So he remained there that</a>
<a id='line_2362'>night.</a>
<a id='line_2363'></a>
<a id='line_2364'>And the next day Peredur sought to go forth.  “To-day may no one journey.</a>
<a id='line_2365'>Thou shalt remain with me to-day and to-morrow, and the day following,</a>
<a id='line_2366'>and I will direct thee as best I may to the place which thou art</a>
<a id='line_2367'>seeking.”  And the fourth day Peredur sought to go forth, and he</a>
<a id='line_2368'>entreated the priest to tell him how he should find the Castle of</a>
<a id='line_2369'>Wonders.  “What I know thereof I will tell thee,” he replied.  “Go over</a>
<a id='line_2370'>yonder mountain, and on the other side of the mountain thou wilt come to</a>
<a id='line_2371'>a river, and in the valley wherein the river runs is a King’s palace,</a>
<a id='line_2372'>wherein the King sojourned during Easter.  And if thou mayest have</a>
<a id='line_2373'>tidings anywhere of the Castle of Wonders, thou wilt have them there.”</a>
<a id='line_2374'></a>
<a id='line_2375'>Then Peredur rode forward.  And he came to the valley in which was the</a>
<a id='line_2376'>river, and there met him a number of men going to hunt, and in the midst</a>
<a id='line_2377'>of them was a man of exalted rank, and Peredur saluted him.  “Choose,</a>
<a id='line_2378'>chieftain,” said the man, “whether thou wilt go with me to the chase, or</a>
<a id='line_2379'>wilt proceed to my palace, and I will dispatch one of my household to</a>
<a id='line_2380'>commend thee to my daughter, who is there, and who will entertain thee</a>
<a id='line_2381'>with food and liquor until I return from hunting; and whatever may be</a>
<a id='line_2382'>thine errand, such as I can obtain for thee thou shalt gladly have.”  And</a>
<a id='line_2383'>the King sent a little yellow page with him as an attendant; and when</a>
<a id='line_2384'>they came to the palace the lady had arisen, and was about to wash before</a>
<a id='line_2385'>meat.  Peredur went forward, and she saluted him joyfully, and placed him</a>
<a id='line_2386'>by her side.  And they took their repast.  And whatsoever Peredur said</a>
<a id='line_2387'>unto her, she laughed loudly, so that all in the palace could hear.  Then</a>
<a id='line_2388'>spoke the yellow page to the lady.  “By my faith,” said he, “this youth</a>
<a id='line_2389'>is already thy husband; or if he be not, thy mind and thy thoughts are</a>
<a id='line_2390'>set upon him.”  And the little yellow page went unto the King, and told</a>
<a id='line_2391'>him that it seemed to him that the youth whom he had met with was his</a>
<a id='line_2392'>daughter’s husband, or if he were not so already that he would shortly</a>
<a id='line_2393'>become so unless he were cautious.  “What is thy counsel in this matter,</a>
<a id='line_2394'>youth?” said the King.  “My counsel is,” he replied, “that thou set</a>
<a id='line_2395'>strong men upon him, to seize him, until thou hast ascertained the truth</a>
<a id='line_2396'>respecting this.”  So he set strong men upon Peredur, who seized him and</a>
<a id='line_2397'>cast him into prison.  And the maiden went before her father, and asked</a>
<a id='line_2398'>him wherefore he had caused the youth from Arthur’s Court to be</a>
<a id='line_2399'>imprisoned.  “In truth,” he answered, “he shall not be free to-night, nor</a>
<a id='line_2400'>to-morrow, nor the day following, and he shall not come from where he</a>
<a id='line_2401'>is.”  She replied not to what the King had said, but she went to the</a>
<a id='line_2402'>youth.  “Is it unpleasant to thee to be here?” said she.  “I should not</a>
<a id='line_2403'>care if I were not,” he replied.  “Thy couch and thy treatment shall be</a>
<a id='line_2404'>in no wise inferior to that of the King himself, and thou shalt have the</a>
<a id='line_2405'>best entertainment that the palace affords.  And if it were more pleasing</a>
<a id='line_2406'>to thee that my couch should be here, that I might discourse with thee,</a>
<a id='line_2407'>it should be so, cheerfully.”  “This can I not refuse,” said Peredur.</a>
<a id='line_2408'>And he remained in prison that night.  And the maiden provided all that</a>
<a id='line_2409'>she had promised him.</a>
<a id='line_2410'></a>
<a id='line_2411'>And the next day Peredur heard a tumult in the town.  “Tell me, fair</a>
<a id='line_2412'>maiden, what is that tumult?” said Peredur.  “All the King’s hosts and</a>
<a id='line_2413'>his forces have come to the town to-day.”  “And what seek they here?” he</a>
<a id='line_2414'>inquired.  “There is an Earl near this place who possesses two Earldoms,</a>
<a id='line_2415'>and is as powerful as a King; and an engagement will take place between</a>
<a id='line_2416'>them to-day.”  “I beseech thee,” said Peredur, “to cause a horse and arms</a>
<a id='line_2417'>to be brought, that I may view the encounter, and I promise to come back</a>
<a id='line_2418'>to my prison again.”  “Gladly,” said she, “will I provide thee with horse</a>
<a id='line_2419'>and arms.”  So she gave him a horse and arms, and a bright scarlet robe</a>
<a id='line_2420'>of honour over his armour, and a yellow shield upon his shoulder.  And he</a>
<a id='line_2421'>went to the combat; and as many of the Earl’s men as encountered him that</a>
<a id='line_2422'>day he overthrew; and he returned to his prison.  And the maiden asked</a>
<a id='line_2423'>tidings of Peredur, and he answered her not a word.  And she went and</a>
<a id='line_2424'>asked tidings of her father, and inquired who had acquitted himself best</a>
<a id='line_2425'>of the household.  And he said that he knew not, but that it was a man</a>
<a id='line_2426'>with a scarlet robe of honour over his armour, and a yellow shield upon</a>
<a id='line_2427'>his shoulder.  Then she smiled, and returned to where Peredur was, and</a>
<a id='line_2428'>did him great honour that night.  And for three days did Peredur slay the</a>
<a id='line_2429'>Earl’s men; and before any one could know who he was, he returned to his</a>
<a id='line_2430'>prison.  And the fourth day Peredur slew the Earl himself.  And the</a>
<a id='line_2431'>maiden went unto her father, and inquired of him the news.  “I have good</a>
<a id='line_2432'>news for thee,” said the King; “the Earl is slain, and I am the owner of</a>
<a id='line_2433'>his two Earldoms.”  “Knowest thou, lord, who slew him?”  “I do not know,”</a>
<a id='line_2434'>said the King.  “It was the knight with the scarlet robe of honour and</a>
<a id='line_2435'>the yellow shield.”  “Lord,” said she, “I know who that is.”  “By</a>
<a id='line_2436'>Heaven!” he exclaimed, “who is he?”  “Lord,” she replied, “he is the</a>
<a id='line_2437'>knight whom thou hast imprisoned.”  Then he went unto Peredur, and</a>
<a id='line_2438'>saluted him, and told him that he would reward the service he had done</a>
<a id='line_2439'>him, in any way he might desire.  And when they went to meat, Peredur was</a>
<a id='line_2440'>placed beside the King, and the maiden on the other side of Peredur.  “I</a>
<a id='line_2441'>will give thee,” said the King, “my daughter in marriage, and half my</a>
<a id='line_2442'>kingdom with her, and the two Earldoms as a gift.”  “Heaven reward thee,</a>
<a id='line_2443'>lord,” said Peredur, “but I came not here to woo.”  “What seekest thou</a>
<a id='line_2444'>then, chieftain?”  “I am seeking tidings of the Castle of Wonders.”  “Thy</a>
<a id='line_2445'>enterprise is greater, chieftain, than thou wilt wish to pursue,” said</a>
<a id='line_2446'>the maiden, “nevertheless, tidings shalt thou have of the Castle, and</a>
<a id='line_2447'>thou shalt have a guide through my father’s dominions, and a sufficiency</a>
<a id='line_2448'>of provisions for thy journey, for thou art, O chieftain, the man whom</a>
<a id='line_2449'>best I love.”  Then she said to him, “Go over yonder mountain, and thou</a>
<a id='line_2450'>wilt find a lake, and in the middle of the lake there is a Castle, and</a>
<a id='line_2451'>that is the Castle that is called the Castle of Wonders; and we know not</a>
<a id='line_2452'>what wonders are therein, but thus is it called.”</a>
<a id='line_2453'></a>
<a id='line_2454'>And Peredur proceeded towards the Castle, and the gate of the Castle was</a>
<a id='line_2455'>open.  And when he came to the hall, the door was open, and he entered.</a>
<a id='line_2456'>And he beheld a chessboard in the hall, and the chessmen were playing</a>
<a id='line_2457'>against each other, by themselves.  And the side that he favoured lost</a>
<a id='line_2458'>the game, and thereupon the others set up a shout, as though they had</a>
<a id='line_2459'>been living men.  And Peredur was wroth, and took the chessmen in his</a>
<a id='line_2460'>lap, and cast the chessboard into the lake.  And when he had done thus,</a>
<a id='line_2461'>behold the black maiden came in, and she said to him, “The welcome of</a>
<a id='line_2462'>Heaven be not unto thee.  Thou hadst rather do evil than good.”  “What</a>
<a id='line_2463'>complaint hast thou against me, maiden?” said Peredur.  “That thou hast</a>
<a id='line_2464'>occasioned unto the Empress the loss of her chessboard, which she would</a>
<a id='line_2465'>not have lost for all her empire.  And the way in which thou mayest</a>
<a id='line_2466'>recover the chessboard is, to repair to the Castle of Ysbidinongyl, where</a>
<a id='line_2467'>is a black man, who lays waste the dominions of the Empress; and if thou</a>
<a id='line_2468'>canst slay him, thou wilt recover the chessboard.  But if thou goest</a>
<a id='line_2469'>there, thou wilt not return alive.”  “Wilt thou direct me thither?” said</a>
<a id='line_2470'>Peredur.  “I will show thee the way,” she replied.  So he went to the</a>
<a id='line_2471'>Castle of Ysbidinongyl, and he fought with the black man.  And the black</a>
<a id='line_2472'>man besought mercy of Peredur.  “Mercy will I grant thee,” said he, “on</a>
<a id='line_2473'>condition that thou cause the chessboard to be restored to the place</a>
<a id='line_2474'>where it was when I entered the hall.”  Then the maiden came to him, and</a>
<a id='line_2475'>said, “The malediction of Heaven attend thee for thy work, since thou</a>
<a id='line_2476'>hast left that monster alive, who lays waste all the possessions of the</a>
<a id='line_2477'>Empress.”  “I granted him his life,” said Peredur, “that he might cause</a>
<a id='line_2478'>the chessboard to be restored.”  “The chessboard is not in the place</a>
<a id='line_2479'>where thou didst find it; go back, therefore, and slay him,” answered</a>
<a id='line_2480'>she.  So Peredur went back, and slew the black man.  And when he returned</a>
<a id='line_2481'>to the palace, he found the black maiden there.  “Ah! maiden,” said</a>
<a id='line_2482'>Peredur, “where is the Empress?”  “I declare to Heaven that thou wilt not</a>
<a id='line_2483'>see her now, unless thou dost slay the monster that is in yonder forest.”</a>
<a id='line_2484'>“What monster is there?”  “It is a stag that is as swift as the swiftest</a>
<a id='line_2485'>bird; and he has one horn in his forehead, as long as the shaft of a</a>
<a id='line_2486'>spear, and as sharp as whatever is sharpest.  And he destroys the</a>
<a id='line_2487'>branches of the best trees in the forest, and he kills every animal that</a>
<a id='line_2488'>he meets with therein; and those that he doth not slay perish of hunger.</a>
<a id='line_2489'>And what is worse than that, he comes every night, and drinks up the</a>
<a id='line_2490'>fish-pond, and leaves the fishes exposed, so that for the most part they</a>
<a id='line_2491'>die before the water returns again.”  “Maiden,” said Peredur, “wilt thou</a>
<a id='line_2492'>come and show me this animal?”  “Not so,” said the maiden, “for he has</a>
<a id='line_2493'>not permitted any mortal to enter the forest for above a twelvemonth.</a>
<a id='line_2494'>Behold, here is a little dog belonging to the Empress, which will rouse</a>
<a id='line_2495'>the stag, and will chase him towards thee, and the stag will attack</a>
<a id='line_2496'>thee.”  Then the little dog went as a guide to Peredur, and roused the</a>
<a id='line_2497'>stag, and brought him towards the place where Peredur was.  And the stag</a>
<a id='line_2498'>attacked Peredur, and he let him pass by him, and as he did so, he smote</a>
<a id='line_2499'>off his head with his sword.  And while he was looking at the head of the</a>
<a id='line_2500'>stag, he saw a lady on horseback coming towards him.  And she took the</a>
<a id='line_2501'>little dog in the lappet of her cap, and the head and the body of the</a>
<a id='line_2502'>stag lay before her.  And around the stag’s neck was a golden collar.</a>
<a id='line_2503'>“Ha! chieftain,” said she, “uncourteously hast thou acted in slaying the</a>
<a id='line_2504'>fairest jewel that was in my dominions.”  “I was entreated so to do; and</a>
<a id='line_2505'>is there any way by which I can obtain thy friendship?”  “There is,” she</a>
<a id='line_2506'>replied.  “Go thou forward unto yonder mountain, and there thou wilt find</a>
<a id='line_2507'>a grove; and in the grove there is a cromlech; do thou there challenge a</a>
<a id='line_2508'>man three times to fight, and thou shalt have my friendship.”</a>
<a id='line_2509'></a>
<a id='line_2510'>So Peredur proceeded onward, and came to the side of the grove, and</a>
<a id='line_2511'>challenged any man to fight.  And a black man arose from beneath the</a>
<a id='line_2512'>cromlech, mounted upon a bony horse, and both he and his horse were clad</a>
<a id='line_2513'>in huge rusty armour.  And they fought.  And as often as Peredur cast the</a>
<a id='line_2514'>black man to the earth, he would jump again into his saddle.  And Peredur</a>
<a id='line_2515'>dismounted, and drew his sword; and thereupon the black man disappeared</a>
<a id='line_2516'>with Peredur’s horse and his own, so that he could not gain sight of him</a>
<a id='line_2517'>a second time.  And Peredur went along the mountain, and on the other</a>
<a id='line_2518'>side of the mountain he beheld a castle in the valley, wherein was a</a>
<a id='line_2519'>river.  And he went to the castle; and as he entered it, he saw a hall,</a>
<a id='line_2520'>and the door of the hall was open, and he went in.  And there he saw a</a>
<a id='line_2521'>lame grey-headed man sitting on one side of the hall, with Gwalchmai</a>
<a id='line_2522'>beside him.  And Peredur beheld his horse, which the black man had taken,</a>
<a id='line_2523'>in the same stall with that of Gwalchmai.  And they were glad concerning</a>
<a id='line_2524'>Peredur.  And he went and seated himself on the other side of the</a>
<a id='line_2525'>hoary-headed man.  Then, behold a yellow-haired youth came, and bent upon</a>
<a id='line_2526'>the knee before Peredur, and besought his friendship.  “Lord,” said the</a>
<a id='line_2527'>youth, “it was I that came in the form of the black maiden to Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_2528'>Court, and when thou didst throw down the chessboard, and when thou didst</a>
<a id='line_2529'>slay the black man of Ysbidinongyl, and when thou didst slay the stag,</a>
<a id='line_2530'>and when thou didst go to fight the black man of the cromlech.  And I</a>
<a id='line_2531'>came with the bloody head in the salver, and with the lance that streamed</a>
<a id='line_2532'>with blood from the point to the hand, all along the shaft; and the head</a>
<a id='line_2533'>was thy cousin’s, and he was killed by the sorceresses of Gloucester, who</a>
<a id='line_2534'>also lamed thine uncle; and I am thy cousin.  And there is a prediction</a>
<a id='line_2535'>that thou art to avenge these things.”  Then Peredur and Gwalchmai took</a>
<a id='line_2536'>counsel, and sent to Arthur and his household, to beseech them to come</a>
<a id='line_2537'>against the sorceresses.  And they began to fight with them; and one of</a>
<a id='line_2538'>the sorceresses slew one of Arthur’s men before Peredur’s face, and</a>
<a id='line_2539'>Peredur bade her forbear.  And the sorceress slew a man before Peredur’s</a>
<a id='line_2540'>face a second time, and a second time he forbad her.  And the third time</a>
<a id='line_2541'>the sorceress slew a man before the face of Peredur; and then Peredur</a>
<a id='line_2542'>drew his sword, and smote the sorceress on the helmet; and all her</a>
<a id='line_2543'>head-armour was split in two parts.  And she set up a cry, and desired</a>
<a id='line_2544'>the other sorceresses to flee, and told them that this was Peredur, the</a>
<a id='line_2545'>man who had learnt Chivalry with them, and by whom they were destined to</a>
<a id='line_2546'>be slain.  Then Arthur and his household fell upon the sorceresses, and</a>
<a id='line_2547'>slew the sorceresses of Gloucester every one.  And thus is it related</a>
<a id='line_2548'>concerning the Castle of Wonders.</a>
<a id='line_2549'></a>
<a id='line_2550'></a>
<a id='line_2551'></a>
<a id='line_2552'></a>
<a id='line_2553'>GERAINT THE SON OF ERBIN</a>
<a id='line_2554'></a>
<a id='line_2555'></a>
<a id='line_2556'>ARTHUR was accustomed to hold his Court at Caerlleon upon Usk.  And there</a>
<a id='line_2557'>he held it seven Easters and five Christmases.  And once upon a time he</a>
<a id='line_2558'>held his Court there at Whitsuntide.  For Caerlleon was the place most</a>
<a id='line_2559'>easy of access in his dominions, both by sea and by land.  And there were</a>
<a id='line_2560'>assembled nine crowned kings, who were his tributaries, and likewise</a>
<a id='line_2561'>earls and barons.  For they were his invited guests at all the high</a>
<a id='line_2562'>festivals, unless they were prevented by any great hindrance.  And when</a>
<a id='line_2563'>he was at Caerlleon, holding his Court, thirteen churches were set apart</a>
<a id='line_2564'>for mass.  And thus were they appointed: one church for Arthur, and his</a>
<a id='line_2565'>kings, and his guests; and the second for Gwenhwyvar and her ladies; and</a>
<a id='line_2566'>the third for the Steward of the Household and the suitors; and the</a>
<a id='line_2567'>fourth for the Franks and the other officers; and the other nine churches</a>
<a id='line_2568'>were for the nine Masters of the Household and chiefly for Cwalchmai; for</a>
<a id='line_2569'>he, from the eminence of his warlike fame, and from the nobleness of his</a>
<a id='line_2570'>birth, was the most exalted of the nine.  And there was no other</a>
<a id='line_2571'>arrangement respecting the churches than that which we have mentioned</a>
<a id='line_2572'>above.</a>
<a id='line_2573'></a>
<a id='line_2574'>Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr was the chief porter; but he did not himself perform</a>
<a id='line_2575'>the office, except at one of the three high festivals, for he had seven</a>
<a id='line_2576'>men to serve him, and they divided the year amongst them.  They were</a>
<a id='line_2577'>Grynn, and Pen Pighon, and Llaes Cymyn, and Gogyfwlch, and Gwrdnei with</a>
<a id='line_2578'>cat’s eyes, who could see as well by night as by day, and Drem the son of</a>
<a id='line_2579'>Dremhitid, and Clust the son of Clustveinyd; and these were Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_2580'>guards.  And on Whit-Tuesday, as the King sat at the banquet, lo! there</a>
<a id='line_2581'>entered a tall, fair-headed youth, clad in a coat and a surcoat of</a>
<a id='line_2582'>diapered satin, and a golden-hilted sword about his neck, and low shoes</a>
<a id='line_2583'>of leather upon his feet.  And he came, and stood before Arthur.  “Hail</a>
<a id='line_2584'>to thee, Lord!” said he.  “Heaven prosper thee,” he answered, “and be</a>
<a id='line_2585'>thou welcome.  Dost thou bring any new tidings?”  “I do, Lord,” he said.</a>
<a id='line_2586'>“I know thee not,” said Arthur.  “It is a marvel to me that thou dost not</a>
<a id='line_2587'>know me.  I am one of thy foresters, Lord, in the Forest of Dean, and my</a>
<a id='line_2588'>name is Madawc, the son of Twrgadarn.”  “Tell me thine errand,” said</a>
<a id='line_2589'>Arthur.  “I will do so, Lord,” said he.  “In the Forest I saw a stag, the</a>
<a id='line_2590'>like of which beheld I never yet.”  “What is there about him,” asked</a>
<a id='line_2591'>Arthur, “that thou never yet didst see his like?”  “He is of pure white,</a>
<a id='line_2592'>Lord, and he does not herd with any other animal through stateliness and</a>
<a id='line_2593'>pride, so royal is his bearing.  And I come to seek thy counsel, Lord,</a>
<a id='line_2594'>and to know thy will concerning him.”  “It seems best to me,” said</a>
<a id='line_2595'>Arthur, “to go and hunt him to-morrow at break of day; and to cause</a>
<a id='line_2596'>general notice thereof to be given to-night in all quarters of the</a>
<a id='line_2597'>Court.”  And Arryfuerys was Arthur’s chief huntsman, and Arelivri was his</a>
<a id='line_2598'>chief page.  And all received notice; and thus it was arranged.  And they</a>
<a id='line_2599'>sent the youth before them.  Then Gwenhwyvar said to Arthur, “Wilt thou</a>
<a id='line_2600'>permit me, Lord,” said she, “to go to-morrow to see and hear the hunt of</a>
<a id='line_2601'>the stag of which the young man spoke?”  “I will gladly,” said Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_2602'>“Then will I go,” said she.  And Gwalchmai said to Arthur, “Lord, if it</a>
<a id='line_2603'>seem well to thee, permit that into whose hunt soever the stag shall</a>
<a id='line_2604'>come, that one, be he a knight, or one on foot, may cut off his head, and</a>
<a id='line_2605'>give it to whom he pleases, whether to his own lady-love, or to the lady</a>
<a id='line_2606'>of his friend.”  “I grant it gladly,” said Arthur, “and let the Steward</a>
<a id='line_2607'>of the Household be chastised, if all are not ready to-morrow for the</a>
<a id='line_2608'>chase.”</a>
<a id='line_2609'></a>
<a id='line_2610'>And they passed the night with songs, and diversions, and discourse, and</a>
<a id='line_2611'>ample entertainment.  And when it was time for them all to go to sleep,</a>
<a id='line_2612'>they went.  And when the next day came, they arose; and Arthur called the</a>
<a id='line_2613'>attendants, who guarded his couch.  And these were four pages, whose</a>
<a id='line_2614'>names were Cadyrnerth the son of Porthawr Gandwy, and Ambreu the son of</a>
<a id='line_2615'>Bedwor, and Amhar the son of Arthur, and Goreu the son of Custennin.  And</a>
<a id='line_2616'>these men came to Arthur and saluted him, and arrayed him in his</a>
<a id='line_2617'>garments.  And Arthur wondered that Gwenhwyvar did not awake, and did not</a>
<a id='line_2618'>move in her bed; and the attendants wished to awaken her.  “Disturb her</a>
<a id='line_2619'>not,” said Arthur, “for she had rather sleep than go to see the hunting.”</a>
<a id='line_2620'></a>
<a id='line_2621'>Then Arthur went forth, and he heard two horns sounding, one from near</a>
<a id='line_2622'>the lodging of the chief huntsman, and the other from near that of the</a>
<a id='line_2623'>chief page.  And the whole assembly of the multitudes came to Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_2624'>they took the road to the Forest.</a>
<a id='line_2625'></a>
<a id='line_2626'>And after Arthur had gone forth from the palace, Gwenhwyvar awoke, and</a>
<a id='line_2627'>called to her maidens, and apparelled herself.  “Maidens,” said she, “I</a>
<a id='line_2628'>had leave last night to go and see the hunt.  Go one of you to the</a>
<a id='line_2629'>stable, and order hither a horse such as a woman may ride.”  And one of</a>
<a id='line_2630'>them went, and she found but two horses in the stable, and Gwenhwyvar and</a>
<a id='line_2631'>one of her maidens mounted them, and went through the Usk, and followed</a>
<a id='line_2632'>the track of the men and the horses.  And as they rode thus, they heard a</a>
<a id='line_2633'>loud and rushing sound; and they looked behind them, and beheld a knight</a>
<a id='line_2634'>upon a hunter foal of mighty size; and the rider was a fair-haired youth,</a>
<a id='line_2635'>bare-legged, and of princely mien, and a golden-hilted sword was at his</a>
<a id='line_2636'>side, and a robe and a surcoat of satin were upon him, and two low shoes</a>
<a id='line_2637'>of leather upon his feet; and around him was a scarf of blue purple, at</a>
<a id='line_2638'>each corner of which was a golden apple.  And his horse stepped stately,</a>
<a id='line_2639'>and swift, and proud; and he overtook Gwenhwyvar, and saluted her.</a>
<a id='line_2640'>“Heaven prosper thee, Geraint,” said she, “I knew thee when first I saw</a>
<a id='line_2641'>thee just now.  And the welcome of Heaven be unto thee.  And why didst</a>
<a id='line_2642'>thou not go with thy lord to hunt?”  “Because I knew not when he went,”</a>
<a id='line_2643'>said he.  “I marvel, too,” said she, “how he could go unknown to me.”</a>
<a id='line_2644'>“Indeed, lady,” said he.  “I was asleep, and knew not when he went; but</a>
<a id='line_2645'>thou, O young man, art the most agreeable companion I could have in the</a>
<a id='line_2646'>whole kingdom; and it may be, that I shall be more amused with the</a>
<a id='line_2647'>hunting than they; for we shall hear the horns when they sound, and we</a>
<a id='line_2648'>shall hear the dogs when they are let loose, and begin to cry.”  So they</a>
<a id='line_2649'>went to the edge of the Forest, and there they stood.  “From this place,”</a>
<a id='line_2650'>said she, “we shall hear when the dogs are let loose.”  And thereupon,</a>
<a id='line_2651'>they heard a loud noise, and they looked towards the spot whence it came,</a>
<a id='line_2652'>and they beheld a dwarf riding upon a horse, stately, and foaming, and</a>
<a id='line_2653'>prancing, and strong, and spirited.  And in the hand of the dwarf was a</a>
<a id='line_2654'>whip.  And near the dwarf they saw a lady upon a beautiful white horse,</a>
<a id='line_2655'>of steady and stately pace; and she was clothed in a garment of gold</a>
<a id='line_2656'>brocade.  And near her was a knight upon a warhorse of large size, with</a>
<a id='line_2657'>heavy and bright armour both upon himself and upon his horse.  And truly</a>
<a id='line_2658'>they never before saw a knight, or a horse, or armour, of such remarkable</a>
<a id='line_2659'>size.  And they were all near to each other.</a>
<a id='line_2660'></a>
<a id='line_2661'>“Geraint,” said Gwenhwyvar, “knowest thou the name of that tall knight</a>
<a id='line_2662'>yonder?”  “I know him not,” said he, “and the strange armour that he</a>
<a id='line_2663'>wears prevents my either seeing his face or his features.”  “Go, maiden,”</a>
<a id='line_2664'>said Gwenhwyvar, “and ask the dwarf who that knight is.”  Then the maiden</a>
<a id='line_2665'>went up to the dwarf; and the dwarf waited for the maiden, when he saw</a>
<a id='line_2666'>her coming towards him.  And the maiden inquired of the dwarf who the</a>
<a id='line_2667'>knight was.  “I will not tell thee,” he answered.  “Since thou art so</a>
<a id='line_2668'>churlish as not to tell me,” said she, “I will ask him himself.”  “Thou</a>
<a id='line_2669'>shalt not ask him, by my faith,” said he.  “Wherefore?” said she.</a>
<a id='line_2670'>“Because thou art not of honour sufficient to befit thee to speak to my</a>
<a id='line_2671'>Lord.”  Then the maiden turned her horse’s head towards the knight, upon</a>
<a id='line_2672'>which the dwarf struck her with the whip that was in his hand across the</a>
<a id='line_2673'>face and the eyes, until the blood flowed forth.  And the maiden, through</a>
<a id='line_2674'>the hurt she received from the blow, returned to Gwenhwyvar, complaining</a>
<a id='line_2675'>of the pain.  “Very rudely has the dwarf treated thee,” said Geraint.  “I</a>
<a id='line_2676'>will go myself to know who the knight is.”  “Go,” said Gwenhwyvar.  And</a>
<a id='line_2677'>Geraint went up to the dwarf.  “Who is yonder knight?” said Geraint.  “I</a>
<a id='line_2678'>will not tell thee,” said the dwarf.  “Then will I ask him himself,” said</a>
<a id='line_2679'>he.  “That wilt thou not, by my faith,” said the dwarf, “thou art not</a>
<a id='line_2680'>honourable enough to speak with my Lord.”  Said Geraint, “I have spoken</a>
<a id='line_2681'>with men of equal rank with him.”  And he turned his horse’s head towards</a>
<a id='line_2682'>the knight; but the dwarf overtook him, and struck him as he had done the</a>
<a id='line_2683'>maiden, so that the blood coloured the scarf that Geraint wore.  Then</a>
<a id='line_2684'>Geraint put his hand upon the hilt of his sword, but he took counsel with</a>
<a id='line_2685'>himself, and considered that it would be no vengeance for him to slay the</a>
<a id='line_2686'>dwarf, and to be attacked unarmed by the armed knight, so he returned to</a>
<a id='line_2687'>where Gwenhwyvar was.</a>
<a id='line_2688'></a>
<a id='line_2689'>“Thou hast acted wisely and discreetly,” said she.  “Lady,” said he, “I</a>
<a id='line_2690'>will follow him yet, with thy permission; and at last he will come to</a>
<a id='line_2691'>some inhabited place, where I may have arms either as a loan or for a</a>
<a id='line_2692'>pledge, so that I may encounter the knight.”  “Go,” said she, “and do not</a>
<a id='line_2693'>attack him until thou hast good arms, and I shall be very anxious</a>
<a id='line_2694'>concerning thee, until I hear tidings of thee.”  “If I am alive,” said</a>
<a id='line_2695'>he, “thou shalt hear tidings of me by to-morrow afternoon;” and with that</a>
<a id='line_2696'>he departed.</a>
<a id='line_2697'></a>
<a id='line_2698'>And the road they took was below the palace of Caerlleon, and across the</a>
<a id='line_2699'>ford of the Usk; and they went along a fair, and even, and lofty ridge of</a>
<a id='line_2700'>ground, until they came to a town, and at the extremity of the town they</a>
<a id='line_2701'>saw a Fortress and a Castle.  And they came to the extremity of the town.</a>
<a id='line_2702'>And as the knight passed through it, all the people arose, and saluted</a>
<a id='line_2703'>him, and bade him welcome.  And when Geraint came into the town, he</a>
<a id='line_2704'>looked at every house, to see if he knew any of those whom he saw.  But</a>
<a id='line_2705'>he knew none, and none knew him to do him the kindness to let him have</a>
<a id='line_2706'>arms either as a loan or for a pledge.  And every house he saw was full</a>
<a id='line_2707'>of men, and arms, and horses.  And they were polishing shields, and</a>
<a id='line_2708'>burnishing swords, and washing armour, and shoeing horses.  And the</a>
<a id='line_2709'>knight, and the lady, and the dwarf rode up to the Castle that was in the</a>
<a id='line_2710'>town, and every one was glad in the Castle.  And from the battlements and</a>
<a id='line_2711'>the gates they risked their necks, through their eagerness to greet them,</a>
<a id='line_2712'>and to show their joy.</a>
<a id='line_2713'></a>
<a id='line_2714'>Geraint stood there to see whether the knight would remain in the Castle;</a>
<a id='line_2715'>and when he was certain that he would do so, he looked around him; and at</a>
<a id='line_2716'>a little distance from the town he saw an old palace in ruins, wherein</a>
<a id='line_2717'>was a hall that was falling to decay.  And as he knew not any one in the</a>
<a id='line_2718'>town, he went towards the old palace; and when he came near to the</a>
<a id='line_2719'>palace, he saw but one chamber, and a bridge of marble-stone leading to</a>
<a id='line_2720'>it.  And upon the bridge he saw sitting a hoary-headed man, upon whom</a>
<a id='line_2721'>were tattered garments.  And Geraint gazed steadfastly upon him for a</a>
<a id='line_2722'>long time.  Then the hoary-headed man spoke to him.  “Young man,” he</a>
<a id='line_2723'>said, “wherefore art thou thoughtful?”  “I am thoughtful,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_2724'>“because I know not where to go to-night.”  “Wilt thou come forward this</a>
<a id='line_2725'>way, chieftain?” said he, “and thou shalt have of the best that can be</a>
<a id='line_2726'>procured for thee.”  So Geraint went forward.  And the hoary-headed man</a>
<a id='line_2727'>preceded him into the hall.  And in the hall he dismounted, and he left</a>
<a id='line_2728'>there his horse.  Then he went on to the upper chamber with the</a>
<a id='line_2729'>hoary-headed man.  And in the chamber he beheld an old decrepit woman,</a>
<a id='line_2730'>sitting on a cushion, with old, tattered garments of satin upon her; and</a>
<a id='line_2731'>it seemed to him that he had never seen a woman fairer than she must have</a>
<a id='line_2732'>been, when in the fulness of youth.  And beside her was a maiden, upon</a>
<a id='line_2733'>whom were a vest and a veil, that were old, and beginning to be worn out.</a>
<a id='line_2734'>And truly, he never saw a maiden more full of comeliness, and grace, and</a>
<a id='line_2735'>beauty than she.  And the hoary-headed man said to the maiden, “There is</a>
<a id='line_2736'>no attendant for the horse of this youth but thyself.”  “I will render</a>
<a id='line_2737'>the best service I am able,” said she, “both to him and to his horse.”</a>
<a id='line_2738'>And the maiden disarrayed the youth, and then she furnished his horse</a>
<a id='line_2739'>with straw and with corn.  And she went to the hall as before, and then</a>
<a id='line_2740'>she returned to the chamber.  And the hoary-headed man said to the</a>
<a id='line_2741'>maiden, “Go to the town,” said he, “and bring hither the best that thou</a>
<a id='line_2742'>canst find both of food and of liquor.”  “I will, gladly, Lord,” said</a>
<a id='line_2743'>she.  And to the town went the maiden.  And they conversed together while</a>
<a id='line_2744'>the maiden was at the town.  And, behold! the maiden came back, and a</a>
<a id='line_2745'>youth with her, bearing on his back a costrel full of good purchased</a>
<a id='line_2746'>mead, and a quarter of a young bullock.  And in the hands of the maiden</a>
<a id='line_2747'>was a quantity of white bread, and she had some manchet bread in her</a>
<a id='line_2748'>veil, and she came into the chamber.  “I could not obtain better than</a>
<a id='line_2749'>this,” said she, “nor with better should I have been trusted.”  “It is</a>
<a id='line_2750'>good enough,” said Geraint.  And they caused the meat to be boiled; and</a>
<a id='line_2751'>when their food was ready, they sat down.  And it was on this wise;</a>
<a id='line_2752'>Geraint sat between the hoary-headed man and his wife, and the maiden</a>
<a id='line_2753'>served them.  And they ate and drank.</a>
<a id='line_2754'></a>
<a id='line_2755'>And when they had finished eating, Geraint talked with the hoary-headed</a>
<a id='line_2756'>man, and he asked him in the first place, to whom belonged the palace</a>
<a id='line_2757'>that he was in.  “Truly,” said he, “it was I that built it, and to me</a>
<a id='line_2758'>also belonged the city and the castle which thou sawest.”  “Alas!” said</a>
<a id='line_2759'>Geraint, “how is it that thou hast lost them now?”  “I lost a great</a>
<a id='line_2760'>Earldom as well as these,” said he; “and this is how I lost them.  I had</a>
<a id='line_2761'>a nephew, the son of my brother, and I took his possessions to myself;</a>
<a id='line_2762'>and when he came to his strength, he demanded of me his property, but I</a>
<a id='line_2763'>withheld it from him.  So he made war upon me, and wrested from me all</a>
<a id='line_2764'>that I possessed.”  “Good Sir,” said Geraint, “wilt thou tell me</a>
<a id='line_2765'>wherefore came the knight, and the lady, and the dwarf, just now into the</a>
<a id='line_2766'>town, and what is the preparation which I saw, and the putting of arms in</a>
<a id='line_2767'>order?”  “I will do so,” said he.  “The preparations are for the game</a>
<a id='line_2768'>that is to be held to-morrow by the young Earl, which will be on this</a>
<a id='line_2769'>wise.  In the midst of a meadow which is here, two forks will be set up,</a>
<a id='line_2770'>and upon the two forks a silver rod, and upon the silver rod a</a>
<a id='line_2771'>Sparrow-Hawk, and for the Sparrow-Hawk there will be a tournament.  And</a>
<a id='line_2772'>to the tournament will go all the array thou didst see in the city, of</a>
<a id='line_2773'>men, and of horses, and of arms.  And with each man will go the lady he</a>
<a id='line_2774'>loves best; and no man can joust for the Sparrow-Hawk, except the lady he</a>
<a id='line_2775'>loves best be with him.  And the knight that thou sawest has gained the</a>
<a id='line_2776'>Sparrow-Hawk these two years; and if he gains it the third year, they</a>
<a id='line_2777'>will, from that time, send it every year to him, and he himself will come</a>
<a id='line_2778'>here no more.  And he will be called the Knight of the Sparrow-Hawk from</a>
<a id='line_2779'>that time forth.”  “Sir,” said Geraint, “what is thy counsel to me</a>
<a id='line_2780'>concerning this knight, on account of the insult which I received from</a>
<a id='line_2781'>the dwarf, and that which was received by the maiden of Gwenhwyvar, the</a>
<a id='line_2782'>wife of Arthur?”  And Geraint told the hoary-headed man what the insult</a>
<a id='line_2783'>was that he had received.  “It is not easy to counsel thee, inasmuch as</a>
<a id='line_2784'>thou hast neither dame nor maiden belonging to thee, for whom thou canst</a>
<a id='line_2785'>joust.  Yet, I have arms here, which thou couldest have; and there is my</a>
<a id='line_2786'>horse also, if he seem to thee better than thine own.”  “Ah!  Sir,” said</a>
<a id='line_2787'>he, “Heaven reward thee.  But my own horse, to which I am accustomed,</a>
<a id='line_2788'>together with thy arms, will suffice me.  And if, when the appointed time</a>
<a id='line_2789'>shall come to-morrow, thou wilt permit me, Sir, to challenge for yonder</a>
<a id='line_2790'>maiden that is thy daughter, I will engage, if I escape from the</a>
<a id='line_2791'>tournament, to love the maiden as long as I live; and if I do not escape,</a>
<a id='line_2792'>she will remain unsullied as before.”  “Gladly will I permit thee,” said</a>
<a id='line_2793'>the hoary-headed man, “and since thou dost thus resolve, it is necessary</a>
<a id='line_2794'>that thy horse and arms should be ready to-morrow at break of day.  For</a>
<a id='line_2795'>then the Knight of the Sparrow-Hawk will make proclamation, and ask the</a>
<a id='line_2796'>lady he loves best to take the Sparrow-Hawk.  ‘For,’ will he say to her,</a>
<a id='line_2797'>‘thou art the fairest of women, and thou didst possess it last year, and</a>
<a id='line_2798'>the year previous; and if any deny it thee to-day, by force will I defend</a>
<a id='line_2799'>it for thee.’  And therefore,” said the hoary-headed man, “it is needful</a>
<a id='line_2800'>for thee to be there at daybreak; and we three will be with thee.”  And</a>
<a id='line_2801'>thus was it settled.</a>
<a id='line_2802'></a>
<a id='line_2803'>And at night, lo! they went to sleep; and before the dawn they arose, and</a>
<a id='line_2804'>arrayed themselves; and by the time that it was day, they were all four</a>
<a id='line_2805'>in the meadow.  And there was the Knight of the Sparrow-Hawk making the</a>
<a id='line_2806'>proclamation, and asking his lady-love to fetch the Sparrow-Hawk.  “Fetch</a>
<a id='line_2807'>it not,” said Geraint, “for there is here a maiden, who is fairer, and</a>
<a id='line_2808'>more noble, and more comely, and who has a better claim to it than thou.”</a>
<a id='line_2809'>“If thou maintainest the Sparrow-Hawk to be due to her, come forward, and</a>
<a id='line_2810'>do battle with me.”  And Geraint went forward to the top of the meadow,</a>
<a id='line_2811'>having upon himself and upon his horse armour which was heavy, and rusty,</a>
<a id='line_2812'>and worthless, and of uncouth shape.  Then they encountered each other,</a>
<a id='line_2813'>and they broke a set of lances, and they broke a second set, and a third.</a>
<a id='line_2814'>And thus they did at every onset, and they broke as many lances as were</a>
<a id='line_2815'>brought to them.  And when the Earl and his company saw the Knight of the</a>
<a id='line_2816'>Sparrow-Hawk gaining the mastery, there was shouting, and joy, and mirth</a>
<a id='line_2817'>amongst them.  And the hoary-headed man, and his wife, and his daughter</a>
<a id='line_2818'>were sorrowful.  And the hoary-headed man served Geraint lances as often</a>
<a id='line_2819'>as he broke them, and the dwarf served the Knight of the Sparrow-Hawk.</a>
<a id='line_2820'>Then the hoary-headed man came to Geraint.  “Oh! chieftain,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_2821'>“since no other will hold with thee, behold, here is the lance which was</a>
<a id='line_2822'>in my hand on the day when I received the honour of knighthood; and from</a>
<a id='line_2823'>that time to this I never broke it.  And it has an excellent point.”</a>
<a id='line_2824'>Then Geraint took the lance, thanking the hoary-headed man.  And</a>
<a id='line_2825'>thereupon the dwarf also brought a lance to his lord.  “Behold, here is a</a>
<a id='line_2826'>lance for thee, not less good than his,” said the dwarf.  “And bethink</a>
<a id='line_2827'>thee, that no knight ever withstood thee before so long as this one has</a>
<a id='line_2828'>done.”  “I declare to Heaven,” said Geraint, “that unless death takes me</a>
<a id='line_2829'>quickly hence, he shall fare never the better for thy service.”  And</a>
<a id='line_2830'>Geraint pricked his horse towards him from afar, and warning him, he</a>
<a id='line_2831'>rushed upon him, and gave him a blow so severe, and furious, and fierce,</a>
<a id='line_2832'>upon the face of his shield, that he cleft it in two, and broke his</a>
<a id='line_2833'>armour, and burst his girths, so that both he and his saddle were borne</a>
<a id='line_2834'>to the ground over the horse’s crupper.  And Geraint dismounted quickly.</a>
<a id='line_2835'>And he was wroth, and he drew his sword, and rushed fiercely upon him.</a>
<a id='line_2836'>Then the knight also arose, and drew his sword against Geraint.  And they</a>
<a id='line_2837'>fought on foot with their swords until their arms struck sparks of fire</a>
<a id='line_2838'>like stars from one another; and thus they continued fighting until the</a>
<a id='line_2839'>blood and sweat obscured the light from their eyes.  And when Geraint</a>
<a id='line_2840'>prevailed, the hoary-headed man, and his wife, and his daughter were</a>
<a id='line_2841'>glad; and when the knight prevailed, it rejoiced the Earl and his party.</a>
<a id='line_2842'>Then the hoary-headed man saw Geraint receive a severe stroke, and he</a>
<a id='line_2843'>went up to him quickly, and said to him, “Oh, chieftain, remember the</a>
<a id='line_2844'>treatment which thou hadst from the dwarf; and wilt thou not seek</a>
<a id='line_2845'>vengeance for the insult to thyself, and for the insult to Gwenhwyvar the</a>
<a id='line_2846'>wife of Arthur!”  And Geraint was roused by what he said to him, and he</a>
<a id='line_2847'>called to him all his strength, and lifted up his sword, and struck the</a>
<a id='line_2848'>knight upon the crown of his head, so that he broke all his head-armour,</a>
<a id='line_2849'>and cut through all the flesh and the skin, even to the skull, until he</a>
<a id='line_2850'>wounded the bone.</a>
<a id='line_2851'></a>
<a id='line_2852'>Then the knight fell upon his knees, and cast his sword from his hand,</a>
<a id='line_2853'>and besought mercy of Geraint.  “Of a truth,” said he, “I relinquish my</a>
<a id='line_2854'>overdaring and my pride in craving thy mercy; and unless I have time to</a>
<a id='line_2855'>commit myself to Heaven for my sins, and to talk with a priest, thy mercy</a>
<a id='line_2856'>will avail me little.”  “I will grant thee grace upon this condition,”</a>
<a id='line_2857'>said Geraint, “that thou wilt go to Gwenhwyvar the wife of Arthur, to do</a>
<a id='line_2858'>her satisfaction for the insult which her maiden received from thy dwarf.</a>
<a id='line_2859'>As to myself, for the insult which I received from thee and thy dwarf, I</a>
<a id='line_2860'>am content with that which I have done unto thee.  Dismount not from the</a>
<a id='line_2861'>time thou goest hence until thou comest into the presence of Gwenhwyvar,</a>
<a id='line_2862'>to make her what atonement shall be adjudged at the Court of Arthur.”</a>
<a id='line_2863'>“This will I do gladly.  And who art thou?” said he.  “I am Geraint the</a>
<a id='line_2864'>son of Erbin.  And declare thou also who thou art.”  “I am Edeyrn the son</a>
<a id='line_2865'>of Nudd.”  Then he threw himself upon his horse, and went forward to</a>
<a id='line_2866'>Arthur’s Court, and the lady he loved best went before him and the dwarf,</a>
<a id='line_2867'>with much lamentation.  And thus far this story up to that time.</a>
<a id='line_2868'></a>
<a id='line_2869'>                                * * * * *</a>
<a id='line_2870'></a>
<a id='line_2871'>Then came the little Earl and his hosts to Geraint, and saluted him, and</a>
<a id='line_2872'>bade him to his castle.  “I may not go,” said Geraint, “but where I was</a>
<a id='line_2873'>last night, there will I be to-night also.”  “Since thou wilt none of my</a>
<a id='line_2874'>inviting, thou shalt have abundance of all that I can command for thee,</a>
<a id='line_2875'>in the place thou wast last night.  And I will order ointment for thee,</a>
<a id='line_2876'>to recover thee from thy fatigues, and from the weariness that is upon</a>
<a id='line_2877'>thee.”  “Heaven reward thee,” said Geraint, “and I will go to my</a>
<a id='line_2878'>lodging.”  And thus went Geraint, and Earl Ynywl, and his wife, and his</a>
<a id='line_2879'>daughter.  And when they reached the chamber, the household servants and</a>
<a id='line_2880'>attendants of the young Earl had arrived at the Court, and they arranged</a>
<a id='line_2881'>all the houses, dressing them with straw and with fire; and in a short</a>
<a id='line_2882'>time the ointment was ready, and Geraint came there, and they washed his</a>
<a id='line_2883'>head.  Then came the young Earl, with forty honourable knights from among</a>
<a id='line_2884'>his attendants, and those who were bidden to the tournament.  And Geraint</a>
<a id='line_2885'>came from the anointing.  And the Earl asked him to go to the hall to</a>
<a id='line_2886'>eat.  “Where is the Earl Ynywl,” said Geraint, “and his wife, and his</a>
<a id='line_2887'>daughter?”  “They are in the chamber yonder,” said the Earl’s</a>
<a id='line_2888'>chamberlain, “arraying themselves in garments which the Earl has caused</a>
<a id='line_2889'>to be brought for them.”  “Let not the damsel array herself,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_2890'>“except in her vest and her veil, until she come to the Court of Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_2891'>to be clad by Gwenhwyvar in such garments as she may choose.”  So the</a>
<a id='line_2892'>maiden did not array herself.</a>
<a id='line_2893'></a>
<a id='line_2894'>Then they all entered the hall, and they washed, and went, and sat down</a>
<a id='line_2895'>to meat.  And thus were they seated.  On one side of Geraint sat the</a>
<a id='line_2896'>young Earl, and Earl Ynywl beyond him; and on the other side of Geraint</a>
<a id='line_2897'>were the maiden and her mother.  And after these all sat according to</a>
<a id='line_2898'>their precedence in honour.  And they ate.  And they were served</a>
<a id='line_2899'>abundantly, and they received a profusion of divers kind of gifts.  Then</a>
<a id='line_2900'>they conversed together.  And the young Earl invited Geraint to visit him</a>
<a id='line_2901'>next day.  “I will not, by Heaven,” said Geraint.  “To the Court of</a>
<a id='line_2902'>Arthur will I go with this maiden to-morrow.  And it is enough for me, as</a>
<a id='line_2903'>long as Earl Ynywl is in poverty and trouble; and I go chiefly to seek to</a>
<a id='line_2904'>add to his maintenance.”  “Ah, chieftain,” said the young Earl, “it is</a>
<a id='line_2905'>not by my fault that Earl Ynywl is without his possessions.”  “By my</a>
<a id='line_2906'>faith,” said Geraint, “he shall not remain without them, unless death</a>
<a id='line_2907'>quickly takes me hence.”  “Oh, chieftain,” said he, “with regard to the</a>
<a id='line_2908'>disagreement between me and Ynywl, I will gladly abide by thy counsel,</a>
<a id='line_2909'>and agree to what thou mayest judge right between us.”  “I but ask thee,”</a>
<a id='line_2910'>said Geraint, “to restore to him what is his, and what he should have</a>
<a id='line_2911'>received from the time he lost his possessions, even until this day.”</a>
<a id='line_2912'>“That I will do gladly, for thee,” answered he.  “Then,” said Geraint,</a>
<a id='line_2913'>“whosoever is here who owes homage to Ynywl, let him come forward, and</a>
<a id='line_2914'>perform it on the spot.”  And all the men did so.  And by that treaty</a>
<a id='line_2915'>they abided.  And his castle, and his town, and all his possessions were</a>
<a id='line_2916'>restored to Ynywl.  And he received back all that he had lost, even to</a>
<a id='line_2917'>the smallest jewel.</a>
<a id='line_2918'></a>
<a id='line_2919'>Then spoke Earl Ynywl to Geraint.  “Chieftain,” said he, “behold the</a>
<a id='line_2920'>maiden for whom thou didst challenge at the tournament, I bestow her upon</a>
<a id='line_2921'>thee.”  “She shall go with me,” said Geraint, “to the Court of Arthur;</a>
<a id='line_2922'>and Arthur and Gwenhwyvar they shall dispose of her as they will.”  And</a>
<a id='line_2923'>the next day they proceeded to Arthur’s Court.  So far concerning</a>
<a id='line_2924'>Geraint.</a>
<a id='line_2925'></a>
<a id='line_2926'>                                * * * * *</a>
<a id='line_2927'></a>
<a id='line_2928'>Now, this is how Arthur hunted the stag.  The men and the dogs were</a>
<a id='line_2929'>divided into hunting parties, and the dogs were let loose upon the stag.</a>
<a id='line_2930'>And the last dog that was let loose was the favourite dog of Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_2931'>Cavall was his name.  And he left all the other dogs behind him, and</a>
<a id='line_2932'>turned the stag.  And at the second turn, the stag came towards the</a>
<a id='line_2933'>hunting party of Arthur.  And Arthur set upon him.  And before he could</a>
<a id='line_2934'>be slain by any other, Arthur cut off his head.  Then they sounded the</a>
<a id='line_2935'>death horn for slaying, and they all gathered round.</a>
<a id='line_2936'></a>
<a id='line_2937'>Then came Kadyrieith to Arthur, and spoke to him.  “Lord,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_2938'>“behold, yonder is Gwenhwyvar, and none with her save only one maiden.”</a>
<a id='line_2939'>“Command Gildas the son of Caw, and all the scholars of the Court,” said</a>
<a id='line_2940'>Arthur, “to attend Gwenhwyvar to the palace.”  And they did so.</a>
<a id='line_2941'></a>
<a id='line_2942'>Then they all set forth, holding converse together concerning the head of</a>
<a id='line_2943'>the stag, to whom it should be given.  One wished that it should be given</a>
<a id='line_2944'>to the lady best beloved by him, and another to the lady whom he loved</a>
<a id='line_2945'>best.  And all they of the household, and the knights, disputed sharply</a>
<a id='line_2946'>concerning the head.  And with that they came to the palace.  And when</a>
<a id='line_2947'>Arthur and Gwenhwyvar heard them disputing about the head of the stag,</a>
<a id='line_2948'>Gwenhwyvar said to Arthur, “My lord, this is my counsel concerning the</a>
<a id='line_2949'>stag’s head; let it not be given away until Geraint the son of Erbin</a>
<a id='line_2950'>shall return from the errand he is upon.”  And Gwenhwyvar told Arthur</a>
<a id='line_2951'>what that errand was.  “Right gladly shall it be so,” said Arthur.  And</a>
<a id='line_2952'>thus it was settled.  And the next day Gwenhwyvar caused a watch to be</a>
<a id='line_2953'>set upon the ramparts for Geraint’s coming.  And after mid-day they</a>
<a id='line_2954'>beheld an unshapely little man upon a horse, and after him, as they</a>
<a id='line_2955'>supposed, a dame or a damsel, also on horseback, and after her a knight</a>
<a id='line_2956'>of large stature, bowed down, and hanging his head low and sorrowfully,</a>
<a id='line_2957'>and clad in broken and worthless armour.</a>
<a id='line_2958'></a>
<a id='line_2959'>And before they came near to the gate, one of the watch went to</a>
<a id='line_2960'>Gwenhwyvar, and told her what kind of people they saw, and what aspect</a>
<a id='line_2961'>they bore.  “I know not who they are,” said he.  “But I know,” said</a>
<a id='line_2962'>Gwenhwyvar; “this is the knight whom Geraint pursued, and methinks that</a>
<a id='line_2963'>he comes not here by his own free will.  But Geraint has overtaken him,</a>
<a id='line_2964'>and avenged the insult to the maiden to the uttermost.”  And thereupon,</a>
<a id='line_2965'>behold a porter came to the spot where Gwenhwyvar was.  “Lady,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_2966'>“at the gate there is a knight, and I saw never a man of so pitiful an</a>
<a id='line_2967'>aspect to look upon as he.  Miserable and broken is the armour that he</a>
<a id='line_2968'>wears, and the hue of blood is more conspicuous upon it than its own</a>
<a id='line_2969'>colour.”  “Knowest thou his name?” said she.  “I do,” said he; “he tells</a>
<a id='line_2970'>me that he is Edeyrn the son of Nudd.”  Then she replied, “I know him</a>
<a id='line_2971'>not.”</a>
<a id='line_2972'></a>
<a id='line_2973'>So Gwenhwyvar went to the gate to meet him, and he entered.  And</a>
<a id='line_2974'>Gwenhwyvar was sorry when she saw the condition he was in, even though he</a>
<a id='line_2975'>was accompanied by the churlish dwarf.  Then Edeyrn saluted Gwenhwyvar.</a>
<a id='line_2976'>“Heaven protect thee,” said she.  “Lady,” said he, “Geraint the son of</a>
<a id='line_2977'>Erbin, thy best and most valiant servant, greets thee.”  “Did he meet</a>
<a id='line_2978'>thee?” she asked.  “Yes,” said he, “and it was not to my advantage; and</a>
<a id='line_2979'>that was not his fault, but mine, Lady.  And Geraint greets thee well;</a>
<a id='line_2980'>and in greeting thee he compelled me to come hither to do thy pleasure</a>
<a id='line_2981'>for the insult which thy maiden received from the dwarf.  He forgives the</a>
<a id='line_2982'>insult to himself, in consideration of his having put me in peril of my</a>
<a id='line_2983'>life.  And he imposed on me a condition, manly, and honourable, and</a>
<a id='line_2984'>warrior-like, which was to do thee justice, Lady.”  “Now, where did he</a>
<a id='line_2985'>overtake thee?”  “At the place where we were jousting, and contending for</a>
<a id='line_2986'>the Sparrow-Hawk, in the town which is now called Cardiff.  And there</a>
<a id='line_2987'>were none with him save three persons, of a mean and tattered condition.</a>
<a id='line_2988'>And these were an aged, hoary-headed man, and a woman advanced in years,</a>
<a id='line_2989'>and a fair young maiden, clad in worn-out garments.  And it was for the</a>
<a id='line_2990'>avouchment of the love of that maiden that Geraint jousted for the</a>
<a id='line_2991'>Sparrow-Hawk at the tournament, for he said that that maiden was better</a>
<a id='line_2992'>entitled to the Sparrow-Hawk than this maiden who was with me.  And</a>
<a id='line_2993'>thereupon we encountered each other, and he left me, Lady, as thou</a>
<a id='line_2994'>seest.”  “Sir,” said she, “when thinkest thou that Geraint will be here?”</a>
<a id='line_2995'>“To-morrow, Lady, I think he will be here with the maiden.”</a>
<a id='line_2996'></a>
<a id='line_2997'>Then Arthur came to him, and he saluted Arthur; and Arthur gazed a long</a>
<a id='line_2998'>time upon him, and was amazed to see him thus.  And thinking that he knew</a>
<a id='line_2999'>him, he inquired of him, “Art thou Edeyrn the son of Nudd?”  “I am,</a>
<a id='line_3000'>Lord,” said he, “and I have met with much trouble, and received wounds</a>
<a id='line_3001'>unsupportable.”  Then he told Arthur all his adventure.  “Well,” said</a>
<a id='line_3002'>Arthur, “from what I hear, it behoves Gwenhwyvar to be merciful towards</a>
<a id='line_3003'>thee.”  “The mercy which thou desirest, Lord,” said she, “will I grant to</a>
<a id='line_3004'>him, since it is as insulting to thee that an insult should be offered to</a>
<a id='line_3005'>me as to thyself.”  “Thus will it be best to do,” said Arthur; “let this</a>
<a id='line_3006'>man have medical care until it be known whether he may live.  And if he</a>
<a id='line_3007'>live, he shall do such satisfaction as shall be judged best by the men of</a>
<a id='line_3008'>the Court; and take thou sureties to that effect.  And if he die, too</a>
<a id='line_3009'>much will be the death of such a youth as Edeyrn for an insult to a</a>
<a id='line_3010'>maiden.”  “This pleases me,” said Gwenhwyvar.  And Arthur became surety</a>
<a id='line_3011'>for Edeyrn, and Caradawc the son of Llyr, Gwallawg the son of Llenawg,</a>
<a id='line_3012'>and Owain the son of Nudd, and Gwalchmai, and many others with them.  And</a>
<a id='line_3013'>Arthur caused Morgan Tud to be called to him.  He was the chief</a>
<a id='line_3014'>physician.  “Take with thee Edeyrn the son of Nudd, and cause a chamber</a>
<a id='line_3015'>to be prepared for him, and let him have the aid of medicine as thou</a>
<a id='line_3016'>wouldst do unto myself, if I were wounded, and let none into his chamber</a>
<a id='line_3017'>to molest him, but thyself and thy disciples, to administer to him</a>
<a id='line_3018'>remedies.”  “I will do so gladly, Lord,” said Morgan Tud.  Then said the</a>
<a id='line_3019'>steward of the household, “Whither is it right, Lord, to order the</a>
<a id='line_3020'>maiden?”  “To Gwenhwyvar and her handmaidens,” said he.  And the steward</a>
<a id='line_3021'>of the household so ordered her.  Thus far concerning them.</a>
<a id='line_3022'></a>
<a id='line_3023'>                                * * * * *</a>
<a id='line_3024'></a>
<a id='line_3025'>The next day came Geraint towards the Court; and there was a watch set on</a>
<a id='line_3026'>the ramparts by Gwenhwyvar, lest he should arrive unawares.  And one of</a>
<a id='line_3027'>the watch came to the place where Gwenhwyvar was.  “Lady,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_3028'>“methinks that I see Geraint, and the maiden with him.  He is on</a>
<a id='line_3029'>horseback, but he has his walking gear upon him, and the maiden appears</a>
<a id='line_3030'>to be in white, seeming to be clad in a garment of linen.”  “Assemble all</a>
<a id='line_3031'>the women,” said Gwenhwyvar, “and come to meet Geraint, to welcome him,</a>
<a id='line_3032'>and wish him joy.”  And Gwenhwyvar went to meet Geraint and the maiden.</a>
<a id='line_3033'>And when Geraint came to the place where Gwenhwyvar was, he saluted her.</a>
<a id='line_3034'>“Heaven prosper thee,” said she, “and welcome to thee.  And thy career</a>
<a id='line_3035'>has been successful, and fortunate, and resistless, and glorious.  And</a>
<a id='line_3036'>Heaven reward thee, that thou hast so proudly caused me to have</a>
<a id='line_3037'>retribution.”  “Lady,” said he, “I earnestly desired to obtain thee</a>
<a id='line_3038'>satisfaction according to thy will; and, behold, here is the maiden</a>
<a id='line_3039'>through whom thou hadst thy revenge.”  “Verily,” said Gwenhwyvar, “the</a>
<a id='line_3040'>welcome of Heaven be unto her; and it is fitting that we should receive</a>
<a id='line_3041'>her joyfully.”  Then they went in, and dismounted.  And Geraint came to</a>
<a id='line_3042'>where Arthur was, and saluted him.  “Heaven protect thee,” said Arthur,</a>
<a id='line_3043'>“and the welcome of Heaven be unto thee.  And since Edeyrn the son of</a>
<a id='line_3044'>Nudd has received his overthrow and wounds from thy hands, thou hast had</a>
<a id='line_3045'>a prosperous career.”  “Not upon me be the blame,” said Geraint, “it was</a>
<a id='line_3046'>through the arrogance of Edeyrn the son of Nudd himself that we were not</a>
<a id='line_3047'>friends.  I would not quit him until I knew who he was, and until the one</a>
<a id='line_3048'>had vanquished the other.”  “Now,” said Arthur, “where is the maiden for</a>
<a id='line_3049'>whom I heard thou didst give challenge?”  “She is gone with Gwenhwyvar to</a>
<a id='line_3050'>her chamber.”</a>
<a id='line_3051'></a>
<a id='line_3052'>Then went Arthur to see the maiden.  And Arthur, and all his companions,</a>
<a id='line_3053'>and his whole Court, were glad concerning the maiden.  And certain were</a>
<a id='line_3054'>they all, that had her array been suitable to her beauty, they had never</a>
<a id='line_3055'>seen a maid fairer than she.  And Arthur gave away the maiden to Geraint.</a>
<a id='line_3056'>And the usual bond made between two persons was made between Geraint and</a>
<a id='line_3057'>the maiden, and the choicest of all Gwenhwyvar’s apparel was given to the</a>
<a id='line_3058'>maiden; and thus arrayed, she appeared comely and graceful to all who</a>
<a id='line_3059'>beheld her.  And that day and that night were spent in abundance of</a>
<a id='line_3060'>minstrelsy, and ample gifts of liquor, and a multitude of games.  And</a>
<a id='line_3061'>when it was time for them to go to sleep, they went.  And in the chamber</a>
<a id='line_3062'>where the couch of Arthur and Gwenhwyvar was, the couch of Geraint and</a>
<a id='line_3063'>Enid was prepared.  And from that time she became his bride.  And the</a>
<a id='line_3064'>next day Arthur satisfied all the claimants upon Geraint with bountiful</a>
<a id='line_3065'>gifts.  And the maiden took up her abode in the palace; and she had many</a>
<a id='line_3066'>companions, both men and women, and there was no maiden more esteemed</a>
<a id='line_3067'>than she in the Island of Britain.</a>
<a id='line_3068'></a>
<a id='line_3069'>Then spake Gwenhwyvar.  “Rightly did I judge,” said she, “concerning the</a>
<a id='line_3070'>head of the stag, that it should not be given to any until Geraint’s</a>
<a id='line_3071'>return; and, behold, here is a fit occasion for bestowing it.  Let it be</a>
<a id='line_3072'>given to Enid the daughter of Ynywl, the most illustrious maiden.  And I</a>
<a id='line_3073'>do not believe that any will begrudge it her, for between her and every</a>
<a id='line_3074'>one here there exists nothing but love and friendship.”  Much applauded</a>
<a id='line_3075'>was this by them all, and by Arthur also.  And the head of the stag was</a>
<a id='line_3076'>given to Enid.  And thereupon her fame increased, and her friends</a>
<a id='line_3077'>thenceforward became more in number than before.  And Geraint from that</a>
<a id='line_3078'>time forth loved the stag, and the tournament, and hard encounters; and</a>
<a id='line_3079'>he came victorious from them all.  And a year, and a second, and a third,</a>
<a id='line_3080'>he proceeded thus, until his fame had flown over the face of the kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_3081'></a>
<a id='line_3082'>                                * * * * *</a>
<a id='line_3083'></a>
<a id='line_3084'>And once upon a time Arthur was holding his Court at Caerlleon upon Usk,</a>
<a id='line_3085'>at Whitsuntide.  And, behold, there came to him ambassadors, wise and</a>
<a id='line_3086'>prudent, full of knowledge, and eloquent of speech, and they saluted</a>
<a id='line_3087'>Arthur.  “Heaven prosper you,” said Arthur, “and the welcome of Heaven be</a>
<a id='line_3088'>unto you.  And whence do you come?”  “We come, Lord,” said they, “from</a>
<a id='line_3089'>Cornwall; and we are ambassadors from Erbin the son of Custennin, thy</a>
<a id='line_3090'>uncle, and our mission is unto thee.  And he greets thee well, as an</a>
<a id='line_3091'>uncle should greet his nephew, and as a vassal should greet his lord.</a>
<a id='line_3092'>And he represents unto thee that he waxes heavy and feeble, and is</a>
<a id='line_3093'>advancing in years.  And the neighbouring chiefs, knowing this, grow</a>
<a id='line_3094'>insolent towards him, and covet his land and possessions.  And he</a>
<a id='line_3095'>earnestly beseeches thee, Lord, to permit Geraint his son to return to</a>
<a id='line_3096'>him, to protect his possessions, and to become acquainted with his</a>
<a id='line_3097'>boundaries.  And unto him he represents that it were better for him to</a>
<a id='line_3098'>spend the flower of his youth and the prime of his age in preserving his</a>
<a id='line_3099'>own boundaries, than in tournaments, which are productive of no profit,</a>
<a id='line_3100'>although he obtains glory in them.”</a>
<a id='line_3101'></a>
<a id='line_3102'>“Well,” said Arthur, “go, and divest yourselves of your accoutrements,</a>
<a id='line_3103'>and take food, and refresh yourselves after your fatigues; and before you</a>
<a id='line_3104'>go forth hence you shall have an answer.”  And they went to eat.  And</a>
<a id='line_3105'>Arthur considered that it would go hard with him to let Geraint depart</a>
<a id='line_3106'>from him and from his Court; neither did he think it fair that his cousin</a>
<a id='line_3107'>should be restrained from going to protect his dominions and his</a>
<a id='line_3108'>boundaries, seeing that his father was unable to do so.  No less was the</a>
<a id='line_3109'>grief and regret of Gwenhwyvar, and all her women, and all her damsels,</a>
<a id='line_3110'>through fear that the maiden would leave them.  And that day and that</a>
<a id='line_3111'>night were spent in abundance of feasting.  And Arthur showed Geraint the</a>
<a id='line_3112'>cause of the mission, and of the coming of the ambassadors to him out of</a>
<a id='line_3113'>Cornwall.  “Truly,” said Geraint, “be it to my advantage or disadvantage,</a>
<a id='line_3114'>Lord, I will do according to thy will concerning this embassy.”</a>
<a id='line_3115'>“Behold,” said Arthur, “though it grieves me to part with thee, it is my</a>
<a id='line_3116'>counsel that thou go to dwell in thine own dominions, and to defend thy</a>
<a id='line_3117'>boundaries, and to take with thee to accompany thee as many as thou wilt</a>
<a id='line_3118'>of those thou lovest best among my faithful ones, and among thy friends,</a>
<a id='line_3119'>and among thy companions in arms.”  “Heaven reward thee; and this will I</a>
<a id='line_3120'>do,” said Geraint.  “What discourse,” said Gwenhwyvar, “do I hear between</a>
<a id='line_3121'>you?  Is it of those who are to conduct Geraint to his country?”  “It</a>
<a id='line_3122'>is,” said Arthur.  “Then it is needful for me to consider,” said she,</a>
<a id='line_3123'>“concerning companions and a provision for the lady that is with me?”</a>
<a id='line_3124'>“Thou wilt do well,” said Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_3125'></a>
<a id='line_3126'>And that night they went to sleep.  And the next day the ambassadors were</a>
<a id='line_3127'>permitted to depart, and they were told that Geraint should follow them.</a>
<a id='line_3128'>And on the third day Geraint set forth, and many went with him.</a>
<a id='line_3129'>Gwalchmai the son of Gwyar, and Riogonedd the son of the king of Ireland,</a>
<a id='line_3130'>and Ondyaw the son of the duke of Burgundy, Gwilim the son of the ruler</a>
<a id='line_3131'>of the Franks, Howel the son of Emyr of Brittany, Elivry, and Nawkyrd,</a>
<a id='line_3132'>Gwynn the son of Tringad, Goreu the son of Custennin, Gweir Gwrhyd Vawr,</a>
<a id='line_3133'>Garannaw the son of Golithmer, Peredur the son of Evrawc, Gwynnllogell,</a>
<a id='line_3134'>Gwyr a judge in the Court of Arthur, Dyvyr the son of Alun of Dyved,</a>
<a id='line_3135'>Gwrei Gwalstawd Ieithoedd, Bedwyr the son of Bedrawd, Hadwry the son of</a>
<a id='line_3136'>Gwryon, Kai the son of Kynyr, Odyar the Frank, the Steward of Arthur’s</a>
<a id='line_3137'>Court, and Edeyrn the son of Nudd.  Said Geraint, “I think that I shall</a>
<a id='line_3138'>have enough of knighthood with me.”  “Yes,” said Arthur, “but it will not</a>
<a id='line_3139'>be fitting for thee to take Edeyrn with thee, although he is well, until</a>
<a id='line_3140'>peace shall be made between him and Gwenhwyvar.”  “Gwenhwyvar can permit</a>
<a id='line_3141'>him to go with me, if he give sureties.”  “If she please, she can let him</a>
<a id='line_3142'>go without sureties, for enough of pain and affliction has he suffered</a>
<a id='line_3143'>for the insult which the maiden received from the dwarf.”  “Truly,” said</a>
<a id='line_3144'>Gwenhwyvar, “since it seems well to thee and to Geraint, I will do this</a>
<a id='line_3145'>gladly, Lord.”  Then she permitted Edeyrn freely to depart.  And many</a>
<a id='line_3146'>there were who accompanied Geraint, and they set forth; and never was</a>
<a id='line_3147'>there seen a fairer host journeying towards the Severn.  And on the other</a>
<a id='line_3148'>side of the Severn were the nobles of Erbin the son of Custennin, and his</a>
<a id='line_3149'>foster-father at their head, to welcome Geraint with gladness; and many</a>
<a id='line_3150'>of the women of the Court, with his mother, came to receive Enid the</a>
<a id='line_3151'>daughter of Ynywl, his wife.  And there was great rejoicing and gladness</a>
<a id='line_3152'>throughout the whole Court, and throughout all the country, concerning</a>
<a id='line_3153'>Geraint, because of the greatness of their love towards him, and of the</a>
<a id='line_3154'>greatness of the fame which he had gained since he went from amongst</a>
<a id='line_3155'>them, and because he was come to take possession of his dominions and to</a>
<a id='line_3156'>preserve his boundaries.  And they came to the Court.  And in the Court</a>
<a id='line_3157'>they had ample entertainment, and a multitude of gifts and abundance of</a>
<a id='line_3158'>liquor, and a sufficiency of service, and a variety of minstrelsy and of</a>
<a id='line_3159'>games.  And to do honour to Geraint, all the chief men of the country</a>
<a id='line_3160'>were invited that night to visit him.  And they passed that day and that</a>
<a id='line_3161'>night in the utmost enjoyment.  And at dawn next day Erbin arose, and</a>
<a id='line_3162'>summoned to him Geraint, and the noble persons who had borne him company.</a>
<a id='line_3163'>And he said to Geraint, “I am a feeble and aged man, and whilst I was</a>
<a id='line_3164'>able to maintain the dominion for thee and for myself, I did so.  But</a>
<a id='line_3165'>thou art young, and in the flower of thy vigour and of thy youth;</a>
<a id='line_3166'>henceforth do thou preserve thy possessions.”  “Truly,” said Geraint,</a>
<a id='line_3167'>“with my consent thou shalt not give the power over thy dominions at this</a>
<a id='line_3168'>time into my hands, and thou shalt not take me from Arthur’s Court.”</a>
<a id='line_3169'>“Into thy hands will I give them,” said Erbin, “and this day also shalt</a>
<a id='line_3170'>thou receive the homage of thy subjects.”</a>
<a id='line_3171'></a>
<a id='line_3172'>Then said Gwalchmai, “It were better for thee to satisfy those who have</a>
<a id='line_3173'>boons to ask, to-day, and to-morrow thou canst receive the homage of thy</a>
<a id='line_3174'>dominions.”  So all that had boons to ask were summoned into one place.</a>
<a id='line_3175'>And Kadyrieith came to them, to know what were their requests.  And every</a>
<a id='line_3176'>one asked that which he desired.  And the followers of Arthur began to</a>
<a id='line_3177'>make gifts, and immediately the men of Cornwall came, and gave also.  And</a>
<a id='line_3178'>they were not long in giving, so eager was every one to bestow gifts.</a>
<a id='line_3179'>And of those who came to ask gifts, none departed unsatisfied.  And that</a>
<a id='line_3180'>day and that night were spent in the utmost enjoyment.</a>
<a id='line_3181'></a>
<a id='line_3182'>And the next day, at dawn, Erbin desired Geraint to send messengers to</a>
<a id='line_3183'>the men, to ask them whether it was displeasing to them that he should</a>
<a id='line_3184'>come to receive their homage, and whether they had anything to object to</a>
<a id='line_3185'>him.  Then Geraint sent ambassadors to the men of Cornwall, to ask them</a>
<a id='line_3186'>this.  And they all said that it would be the fulness of joy and honour</a>
<a id='line_3187'>to them for Geraint to come and receive their homage.  So he received the</a>
<a id='line_3188'>homage of such as were there.  And they remained with him till the third</a>
<a id='line_3189'>night.  And the day after the followers of Arthur intended to go away.</a>
<a id='line_3190'>“It is too soon for you to go away yet,” said he, “stay with me until I</a>
<a id='line_3191'>have finished receiving the homage of my chief men, who have agreed to</a>
<a id='line_3192'>come to me.”  And they remained with him until he had done so.  Then they</a>
<a id='line_3193'>set forth towards the Court of Arthur; and Geraint went to bear them</a>
<a id='line_3194'>company, and Enid also, as far as Diganhwy: there they parted.  Then</a>
<a id='line_3195'>Ondyaw the son of the duke of Burgundy said to Geraint, “Go first of all</a>
<a id='line_3196'>and visit the uppermost parts of thy dominions, and see well to the</a>
<a id='line_3197'>boundaries of thy territories; and if thou hast any trouble respecting</a>
<a id='line_3198'>them, send unto thy companions.”  “Heaven reward thee,” said Geraint,</a>
<a id='line_3199'>“and this will I do.”  And Geraint journeyed to the uttermost part of his</a>
<a id='line_3200'>dominions.  And experienced guides, and the chief men of his country,</a>
<a id='line_3201'>went with him.  And the furthermost point that they showed him he kept</a>
<a id='line_3202'>possession of.</a>
<a id='line_3203'></a>
<a id='line_3204'>And, as he had been used to do when he was at Arthur’s Court, he</a>
<a id='line_3205'>frequented tournaments.  And he became acquainted with valiant and mighty</a>
<a id='line_3206'>men, until he had gained as much fame there as he had formerly done</a>
<a id='line_3207'>elsewhere.  And he enriched his Court, and his companions, and his</a>
<a id='line_3208'>nobles, with the best horses and the best arms, and with the best and</a>
<a id='line_3209'>most valuable jewels, and he ceased not until his fame had flown over the</a>
<a id='line_3210'>face of the whole kingdom.  And when he knew that it was thus, he began</a>
<a id='line_3211'>to love ease and pleasure, for there was no one who was worth his</a>
<a id='line_3212'>opposing.  And he loved his wife, and liked to continue in the palace,</a>
<a id='line_3213'>with minstrelsy and diversions.  And for a long time he abode at home.</a>
<a id='line_3214'>And after that he began to shut himself up in the chamber of his wife,</a>
<a id='line_3215'>and he took no delight in anything besides, insomuch that he gave up the</a>
<a id='line_3216'>friendship of his nobles, together with his hunting and his amusements,</a>
<a id='line_3217'>and lost the hearts of all the host in his Court; and there was murmuring</a>
<a id='line_3218'>and scoffing concerning him among the inhabitants of the palace, on</a>
<a id='line_3219'>account of his relinquishing so completely their companionship for the</a>
<a id='line_3220'>love of his wife.  And these tidings came to Erbin.  And when Erbin had</a>
<a id='line_3221'>heard these things, he spoke unto Enid, and inquired of her whether it</a>
<a id='line_3222'>was she that had caused Geraint to act thus, and to forsake his people</a>
<a id='line_3223'>and his hosts.  “Not I, by my confession unto Heaven,” said she, “there</a>
<a id='line_3224'>is nothing more hateful to me than this.”  And she knew not what she</a>
<a id='line_3225'>should do, for, although it was hard for her to own this to Geraint, yet</a>
<a id='line_3226'>was it not more easy for her to listen to what she heard, without warning</a>
<a id='line_3227'>Geraint concerning it.  And she was very sorrowful.</a>
<a id='line_3228'></a>
<a id='line_3229'>And one morning in the summer time, they were upon their couch, and</a>
<a id='line_3230'>Geraint lay upon the edge of it.  And Enid was without sleep in the</a>
<a id='line_3231'>apartment, which had windows of glass.  And the sun shone upon the couch.</a>
<a id='line_3232'>And the clothes had slipped from off his arms and his breast, and he was</a>
<a id='line_3233'>asleep.  Then she gazed upon the marvellous beauty of his appearance, and</a>
<a id='line_3234'>she said, “Alas, and am I the cause that these arms and this breast have</a>
<a id='line_3235'>lost their glory and the warlike fame which they once so richly enjoyed!”</a>
<a id='line_3236'>And as she said this, the tears dropped from her eyes, and they fell upon</a>
<a id='line_3237'>his breast.  And the tears she shed, and the words she had spoken, awoke</a>
<a id='line_3238'>him; and another thing contributed to awaken him, and that was the idea</a>
<a id='line_3239'>that it was not in thinking of him that she spoke thus, but that it was</a>
<a id='line_3240'>because she loved some other man more than him, and that she wished for</a>
<a id='line_3241'>other society, and thereupon Geraint was troubled in his mind, and he</a>
<a id='line_3242'>called his squire; and when he came to him, “Go quickly,” said he, “and</a>
<a id='line_3243'>prepare my horse and my arms, and make them ready.  And do thou arise,”</a>
<a id='line_3244'>said he to Enid, “and apparel thyself; and cause thy horse to be</a>
<a id='line_3245'>accoutred, and clothe thee in the worst riding-dress that thou hast in</a>
<a id='line_3246'>thy possession.  And evil betide me,” said he, “if thou returnest here</a>
<a id='line_3247'>until thou knowest whether I have lost my strength so completely as thou</a>
<a id='line_3248'>didst say.  And if it be so, it will then be easy for thee to seek the</a>
<a id='line_3249'>society thou didst wish for of him of whom thou wast thinking.”  So she</a>
<a id='line_3250'>arose, and clothed herself in her meanest garments.  “I know nothing,</a>
<a id='line_3251'>Lord,” said she, “of thy meaning.”  “Neither wilt thou know at this</a>
<a id='line_3252'>time,” said he.</a>
<a id='line_3253'></a>
<a id='line_3254'>Then Geraint went to see Erbin.  “Sir,” said he, “I am going upon a</a>
<a id='line_3255'>quest, and I am not certain when I may come back.  Take heed, therefore,</a>
<a id='line_3256'>unto thy possessions, until my return.”  “I will do so,” said he, “but it</a>
<a id='line_3257'>is strange to me that thou shouldest go so suddenly.  And who will</a>
<a id='line_3258'>proceed with thee, since thou art not strong enough to traverse the land</a>
<a id='line_3259'>of Lloegyr alone?”  “But one person only will go with me.”  “Heaven</a>
<a id='line_3260'>counsel thee, my son,” said Erbin, “and may many attach themselves to</a>
<a id='line_3261'>thee in Lloegyr.”  Then went Geraint to the place where his horse was,</a>
<a id='line_3262'>and it was equipped with foreign armour, heavy and shining.  And he</a>
<a id='line_3263'>desired Enid to mount her horse, and to ride forward, and to keep a long</a>
<a id='line_3264'>way before him.  “And whatever thou mayest see, and whatever thou mayest</a>
<a id='line_3265'>hear concerning me,” said he, “do thou not turn back.  And unless I speak</a>
<a id='line_3266'>unto thee, say not thou one word either.”  And they set forward.  And he</a>
<a id='line_3267'>did not choose the pleasantest and most frequented road, but that which</a>
<a id='line_3268'>was the wildest and most beset by thieves, and robbers, and venomous</a>
<a id='line_3269'>animals.  And they came to a high road, which they followed till they saw</a>
<a id='line_3270'>a vast forest, and they went towards it, and they saw four armed horsemen</a>
<a id='line_3271'>come forth from the forest.  When the horsemen had beheld them, one of</a>
<a id='line_3272'>them said to the others, “Behold, here is a good occasion for us to</a>
<a id='line_3273'>capture two horses and armour, and a lady likewise; for this we shall</a>
<a id='line_3274'>have no difficulty in doing against yonder single knight, who hangs his</a>
<a id='line_3275'>head so pensively and heavily.”  And Enid heard this discourse, and she</a>
<a id='line_3276'>knew not what she should do through fear of Geraint, who had told her to</a>
<a id='line_3277'>be silent.  “The vengeance of Heaven be upon me,” she said, “if I would</a>
<a id='line_3278'>not rather receive my death from his hand than from the hand of any</a>
<a id='line_3279'>other; and though he should slay me yet will I speak to him, lest I</a>
<a id='line_3280'>should have the misery to witness his death.”  So she waited for Geraint</a>
<a id='line_3281'>until he came near to her.  “Lord,” said she, “didst thou hear the words</a>
<a id='line_3282'>of those men concerning thee?”  Then he lifted up his eyes, and looked at</a>
<a id='line_3283'>her angrily.  “Thou hadst only,” said he, “to hold thy peace as I bade</a>
<a id='line_3284'>thee.  I wish but for silence, and not for warning.  And though thou</a>
<a id='line_3285'>shouldest desire to see my defeat and my death by the hands of those men,</a>
<a id='line_3286'>yet do I feel no dread.”  Then the foremost of them couched his lance,</a>
<a id='line_3287'>and rushed upon Geraint.  And he received him, and that not feebly.  But</a>
<a id='line_3288'>he let the thrust go by him, while he struck the horseman upon the centre</a>
<a id='line_3289'>of his shield in such a manner that his shield was split, and his armour</a>
<a id='line_3290'>broken, and so that a cubit’s length of the shaft of Geraint’s lance</a>
<a id='line_3291'>passed through his body, and sent him to the earth, the length of the</a>
<a id='line_3292'>lance over his horse’s crupper.  Then the second horseman attacked him</a>
<a id='line_3293'>furiously, being wroth at the death of his companion.  But with one</a>
<a id='line_3294'>thrust Geraint overthrew him also, and killed him as he had done the</a>
<a id='line_3295'>other.  Then the third set upon him, and he killed him in like manner.</a>
<a id='line_3296'>And thus also he slew the fourth.  Sad and sorrowful was the maiden as</a>
<a id='line_3297'>she saw all this.  Geraint dismounted from his horse, and took the arms</a>
<a id='line_3298'>of the men he had slain, and placed them upon their saddles, and tied</a>
<a id='line_3299'>together the reins of their horses, and he mounted his horse again.</a>
<a id='line_3300'>“Behold what thou must do,” said he; “take the four horses, and drive</a>
<a id='line_3301'>them before thee, and proceed forward, as I bade thee just now.  And say</a>
<a id='line_3302'>not one word unto me, unless I speak first unto thee.  And I declare unto</a>
<a id='line_3303'>Heaven,” said he, “if thou doest not thus, it will be to thy cost.”  “I</a>
<a id='line_3304'>will do, as far as I can, Lord,” said she, “according to thy desire.”</a>
<a id='line_3305'>Then they went forward through the forest; and when they left the forest,</a>
<a id='line_3306'>they came to a vast plain, in the centre of which was a group of thickly</a>
<a id='line_3307'>tangled copse-wood; and from out thereof they beheld three horsemen</a>
<a id='line_3308'>coming towards them, well equipped with armour, both they and their</a>
<a id='line_3309'>horses.  Then the maiden looked steadfastly upon them; and when they had</a>
<a id='line_3310'>come near, she heard them say one to another, “Behold, here is a good</a>
<a id='line_3311'>arrival for us; here are coming for us four horses and four suits of</a>
<a id='line_3312'>armour.  We shall easily obtain them spite of yonder dolorous knight, and</a>
<a id='line_3313'>the maiden also will fall into our power.”  “This is but too true,” said</a>
<a id='line_3314'>she to herself, “for my husband is tired with his former combat.  The</a>
<a id='line_3315'>vengeance of Heaven will be upon me, unless I warn him of this.”  So the</a>
<a id='line_3316'>maiden waited until Geraint came up to her.  “Lord,” said she, “dust thou</a>
<a id='line_3317'>not hear the discourse of yonder men concerning thee?”  “What was it?”</a>
<a id='line_3318'>asked he.  “They say to one another, that they will easily obtain all</a>
<a id='line_3319'>this spoil.”  “I declare to Heaven,” he answered, “that their words are</a>
<a id='line_3320'>less grievous to me than that thou wilt not be silent, and abide by my</a>
<a id='line_3321'>counsel.”  “My Lord,” said she, “I feared lest they should surprise thee</a>
<a id='line_3322'>unawares.”  “Hold thy peace, then,” said he, “do not I desire silence?”</a>
<a id='line_3323'>And thereupon one of the horsemen couched his lance, and attacked</a>
<a id='line_3324'>Geraint.  And he made a thrust at him, which he thought would be very</a>
<a id='line_3325'>effective; but Geraint received it carelessly, and struck it aside, and</a>
<a id='line_3326'>then he rushed upon him, and aimed at the centre of his person, and from</a>
<a id='line_3327'>the shock of man and horse, the quantity of his armour did not avail him,</a>
<a id='line_3328'>and the head of the lance and part of the shaft passed through him, so</a>
<a id='line_3329'>that he was carried to the ground an arm and a spear’s length over the</a>
<a id='line_3330'>crupper of his horse.  And both the other horsemen came forward in their</a>
<a id='line_3331'>turn, but their onset was not more successful than that of their</a>
<a id='line_3332'>companion.  And the maiden stood by, looking at all this; and on the one</a>
<a id='line_3333'>hand she was in trouble lest Geraint should be wounded in his encounter</a>
<a id='line_3334'>with the men, and on the other hand she was joyful to see him victorious.</a>
<a id='line_3335'>Then Geraint dismounted, and bound the three suits of armour upon the</a>
<a id='line_3336'>three saddles, and he fastened the reins of all the horses together, so</a>
<a id='line_3337'>that he had seven horses with him.  And he mounted his own horse, and</a>
<a id='line_3338'>commanded the maiden to drive forward the others.  “It is no more use for</a>
<a id='line_3339'>me to speak to thee than to refrain, for thou wilt not attend to my</a>
<a id='line_3340'>advice.”  “I will do so, as far as I am able, Lord,” said she; “but I</a>
<a id='line_3341'>cannot conceal from thee the fierce and threatening words which I may</a>
<a id='line_3342'>hear against thee, Lord, from such strange people as those that haunt</a>
<a id='line_3343'>this wilderness.”  “I declare to Heaven,” said he, “that I desire nought</a>
<a id='line_3344'>but silence; therefore, hold thy peace.”  “I will, Lord, while I can.”</a>
<a id='line_3345'>And the maiden went on with the horses before her, and she pursued her</a>
<a id='line_3346'>way straight onwards.  And from the copse-wood already mentioned, they</a>
<a id='line_3347'>journeyed over a vast and dreary open plain.  And at a great distance</a>
<a id='line_3348'>from them they beheld a wood, and they could see neither end nor boundary</a>
<a id='line_3349'>to the wood, except on that side that was nearest to them, and they went</a>
<a id='line_3350'>towards it.  Then there came from out the wood five horsemen, eager, and</a>
<a id='line_3351'>bold, and mighty, and strong, mounted upon chargers that were powerful,</a>
<a id='line_3352'>and large of bone, and high-mettled, and proudly snorting, and both the</a>
<a id='line_3353'>men and the horses were well equipped with arms.  And when they drew near</a>
<a id='line_3354'>to them, Enid heard them say, “Behold, here is a fine booty coming to us,</a>
<a id='line_3355'>which we shall obtain easily and without labour, for we shall have no</a>
<a id='line_3356'>trouble in taking all those horses and arms, and the lady also, from</a>
<a id='line_3357'>yonder single knight, so doleful and sad.”</a>
<a id='line_3358'></a>
<a id='line_3359'>Sorely grieved was the maiden upon hearing this discourse, so that she</a>
<a id='line_3360'>knew not in the world what she should do.  At last, however, she</a>
<a id='line_3361'>determined to warn Geraint; so she turned her horse’s head towards him.</a>
<a id='line_3362'>“Lord,” said she, “if thou hadst heard as I did what yonder horsemen said</a>
<a id='line_3363'>concerning thee, thy heaviness would be greater than it is.”  Angrily and</a>
<a id='line_3364'>bitterly did Geraint smile upon her, and he said, “Thee do I hear doing</a>
<a id='line_3365'>everything that I forbade thee; but it may be that thou will repent this</a>
<a id='line_3366'>yet.”  And immediately, behold, the men met them, and victoriously and</a>
<a id='line_3367'>gallantly did Geraint overcome them all five.  And he placed the five</a>
<a id='line_3368'>suits of armour upon the five saddles, and tied together the reins of the</a>
<a id='line_3369'>twelve horses, and gave them in charge to Enid.  “I know not,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_3370'>“what good it is for me to order thee; but this time I charge thee in an</a>
<a id='line_3371'>especial manner.”  So the maiden went forward towards the wood, keeping</a>
<a id='line_3372'>in advance of Geraint, as he had desired her; and it grieved him as much</a>
<a id='line_3373'>as his wrath would permit, to see a maiden so illustrious as she having</a>
<a id='line_3374'>so much trouble with the care of the horses.  Then they reached the wood,</a>
<a id='line_3375'>and it was both deep and vast; and in the wood night overtook them.  “Ah,</a>
<a id='line_3376'>maiden,” said he, “it is vain to attempt proceeding forward!”  “Well,</a>
<a id='line_3377'>Lord,” said she, “whatsoever thou wishest, we will do.”  “It will be best</a>
<a id='line_3378'>for us,” he answered, “to turn out of the wood, and to rest, and wait for</a>
<a id='line_3379'>the day, in order to pursue our journey.”  “That will we, gladly,” said</a>
<a id='line_3380'>she.  And they did so.  Having dismounted himself, he took her down from</a>
<a id='line_3381'>her horse.  “I cannot, by any means, refrain from sleep, through</a>
<a id='line_3382'>weariness,” said he.  “Do thou, therefore, watch the horses, and sleep</a>
<a id='line_3383'>not.”  “I will, Lord,” said she.  Then he went to sleep in his armour,</a>
<a id='line_3384'>and thus passed the night, which was not long at that season.  And when</a>
<a id='line_3385'>she saw the dawn of day appear, she looked around her, to see if he were</a>
<a id='line_3386'>waking, and thereupon he woke.  “My Lord,” she said, “I have desired to</a>
<a id='line_3387'>awake thee for some time.”  But he spake nothing to her about fatigue, as</a>
<a id='line_3388'>he had desired her to be silent.  Then he arose, and said unto her, “Take</a>
<a id='line_3389'>the horses, and ride on; and keep straight on before thee as thou didst</a>
<a id='line_3390'>yesterday.”  And early in the day they left the wood, and they came to an</a>
<a id='line_3391'>open country, with meadows on one hand, and mowers mowing the meadows.</a>
<a id='line_3392'>And there was a river before them, and the horses bent down, and drank</a>
<a id='line_3393'>the water.  And they went up out of the river by a lofty steep; and there</a>
<a id='line_3394'>they met a slender stripling, with a satchel about his neck, and they saw</a>
<a id='line_3395'>that there was something in the satchel, but they knew not what it was.</a>
<a id='line_3396'>And he had a small blue pitcher in his hand, and a bowl on the mouth of</a>
<a id='line_3397'>the pitcher.  And the youth saluted Geraint.  “Heaven prosper thee,” said</a>
<a id='line_3398'>Geraint, “and whence dost thou come?”  “I come,” said he, “from the city</a>
<a id='line_3399'>that lies before thee.  My Lord,” he added, “will it be displeasing to</a>
<a id='line_3400'>thee if I ask whence thou comest also?”  “By no means—through yonder wood</a>
<a id='line_3401'>did I come.”  “Thou camest not through the wood to-day.”  “No,” he</a>
<a id='line_3402'>replied, “we were in the wood last night.”  “I warrant,” said the youth,</a>
<a id='line_3403'>“that thy condition there last night was not the most pleasant, and that</a>
<a id='line_3404'>thou hadst neither meat nor drink.”  “No, by my faith,” said he.  “Wilt</a>
<a id='line_3405'>thou follow my counsel,” said the youth, “and take thy meal from me?”</a>
<a id='line_3406'>“What sort of meal?” he inquired.  “The breakfast which is sent for</a>
<a id='line_3407'>yonder mowers, nothing less than bread and meat and wine; and if thou</a>
<a id='line_3408'>wilt, Sir, they shall have none of it.”  “I will,” said he, “and Heaven</a>
<a id='line_3409'>reward thee for it.”</a>
<a id='line_3410'></a>
<a id='line_3411'>So Geraint alighted, and the youth took the maiden from off her horse.</a>
<a id='line_3412'>Then they washed, and took their repast.  And the youth cut the bread in</a>
<a id='line_3413'>slices, and gave them drink, and served them withal.  And when they had</a>
<a id='line_3414'>finished, the youth arose, and said to Geraint, “My Lord, with thy</a>
<a id='line_3415'>permission, I will now go and fetch some food for the mowers.”  “Go,</a>
<a id='line_3416'>first, to the town,” said Geraint, “and take a lodging for me in the best</a>
<a id='line_3417'>place that thou knowest, and the most commodious one for the horses, and</a>
<a id='line_3418'>take thou whichever horse and arms thou choosest in payment for thy</a>
<a id='line_3419'>service and thy gift.”  “Heaven reward thee, Lord,” said the youth, “and</a>
<a id='line_3420'>this would be ample to repay services much greater than those I have</a>
<a id='line_3421'>rendered unto thee.”  And to the town went the youth, and he took the</a>
<a id='line_3422'>best and the most pleasant lodgings that he knew; and after that he went</a>
<a id='line_3423'>to the palace, having the horse and armour with him, and proceeded to the</a>
<a id='line_3424'>place where the Earl was, and told him all his adventure.  “I go now,</a>
<a id='line_3425'>Lord,” said he, “to meet the young man, and to conduct him to his</a>
<a id='line_3426'>lodging.”  “Go, gladly,” said the Earl, “and right joyfully shall he be</a>
<a id='line_3427'>received here, if he so come.”  And the youth went to meet Geraint, and</a>
<a id='line_3428'>told him that he would be received gladly by the Earl in his own palace;</a>
<a id='line_3429'>but he would go only to his lodgings.  And he had a goodly chamber, in</a>
<a id='line_3430'>which was plenty of straw, and drapery, and a spacious and commodious</a>
<a id='line_3431'>place he had for the horses; and the youth prepared for them plenty of</a>
<a id='line_3432'>provender.  And after they had disarrayed themselves, Geraint spoke thus</a>
<a id='line_3433'>to Enid: “Go,” said he, “to the other side of the chamber, and come not</a>
<a id='line_3434'>to this side of the house; and thou mayest call to thee the woman of the</a>
<a id='line_3435'>house, if thou wilt.”  “I will do, Lord,” said she, “as thou sayest.”</a>
<a id='line_3436'>And thereupon the man of the house came to Geraint, and welcomed him.</a>
<a id='line_3437'>“Oh, chieftain,” he said, “hast thou taken thy meal?”  “I have,” said he.</a>
<a id='line_3438'>Then the youth spoke to him, and inquired if he would not drink something</a>
<a id='line_3439'>before he met the Earl.  “Truly I will,” said he.  So the youth went into</a>
<a id='line_3440'>the town, and brought them drink.  And they drank.  “I must needs sleep,”</a>
<a id='line_3441'>said Geraint.  “Well,” said the youth; “and whilst thou sleepest, I will</a>
<a id='line_3442'>go to see the Earl.”  “Go, gladly,” he said, “and come here again when I</a>
<a id='line_3443'>require thee.”  And Geraint went to sleep; and so did Enid also.</a>
<a id='line_3444'></a>
<a id='line_3445'>And the youth came to the place where the Earl was, and the Earl asked</a>
<a id='line_3446'>him where the lodgings of the knight were, and he told him.  “I must go,”</a>
<a id='line_3447'>said the youth, “to wait on him in the evening.”  “Go,” answered the</a>
<a id='line_3448'>Earl, “and greet him well from me, and tell him that in the evening I</a>
<a id='line_3449'>will go to see him.”  “This will I do,” said the youth.  So he came when</a>
<a id='line_3450'>it was time for them to awake.  And they arose, and went forth.  And when</a>
<a id='line_3451'>it was time for them to take their food, they took it.  And the youth</a>
<a id='line_3452'>served them.  And Geraint inquired of the man of the house, whether there</a>
<a id='line_3453'>were any of his companions that he wished to invite to him, and he said</a>
<a id='line_3454'>that there were.  “Bring them hither, and entertain them at my cost with</a>
<a id='line_3455'>the best thou canst buy in the town.”</a>
<a id='line_3456'></a>
<a id='line_3457'>And the man of the house brought there those whom he chose, and feasted</a>
<a id='line_3458'>them at Geraint’s expense.  Thereupon, behold, the Earl came to visit</a>
<a id='line_3459'>Geraint, and his twelve honourable knights with him.  And Geraint rose</a>
<a id='line_3460'>up, and welcomed him.  “Heaven preserve thee,” said the Earl.  Then they</a>
<a id='line_3461'>all sat down according to their precedence in honour.  And the Earl</a>
<a id='line_3462'>conversed with Geraint, and inquired of him the object of his journey.</a>
<a id='line_3463'>“I have none,” he replied, “but to seek adventures, and to follow my own</a>
<a id='line_3464'>inclination.”  Then the Earl cast his eye upon Enid, and he looked at her</a>
<a id='line_3465'>steadfastly.  And he thought he had never seen a maiden fairer or more</a>
<a id='line_3466'>comely than she.  And he set all his thoughts and his affections upon</a>
<a id='line_3467'>her.  Then he asked of Geraint, “Have I thy permission to go and converse</a>
<a id='line_3468'>with yonder maiden, for I see that she is apart from thee?”  “Thou hast</a>
<a id='line_3469'>it gladly,” said he.  So the Earl went to the place where the maiden was,</a>
<a id='line_3470'>and spake with her.  “Ah, maiden,” said he, “it cannot be pleasant to</a>
<a id='line_3471'>thee to journey thus with yonder man!”  “It is not unpleasant to me,”</a>
<a id='line_3472'>said she, “to journey the same road that he journeys.”  “Thou hast</a>
<a id='line_3473'>neither youths nor maidens to serve thee,” said he.  “Truly,” she</a>
<a id='line_3474'>replied, “it is more pleasant for me to follow yonder man, than to be</a>
<a id='line_3475'>served by youths and maidens.”  “I will give thee good counsel,” said he.</a>
<a id='line_3476'>“All my Earldom will I place in thy possession, if thou wilt dwell with</a>
<a id='line_3477'>me.”  “That will I not, by Heaven,” she said; “yonder man was the first</a>
<a id='line_3478'>to whom my faith was ever pledged; and shall I prove inconstant to him!”</a>
<a id='line_3479'>“Thou art in the wrong,” said the Earl; “if I slay the man yonder, I can</a>
<a id='line_3480'>keep thee with me as long as I choose; and when thou no longer pleasest</a>
<a id='line_3481'>me I can turn thee away.  But if thou goest with me by thine own good</a>
<a id='line_3482'>will, I protest that our union shall continue eternal and undivided as</a>
<a id='line_3483'>long as I remain alive.”  Then she pondered these words of his, and she</a>
<a id='line_3484'>considered that it was advisable to encourage him in his request.</a>
<a id='line_3485'>“Behold, then, chieftain, this is most expedient for thee to do to save</a>
<a id='line_3486'>me any needless imputation; come here to-morrow, and take me away as</a>
<a id='line_3487'>though I knew nothing thereof.”  “I will do so,” said he.  So he arose,</a>
<a id='line_3488'>and took his leave, and went forth with his attendants.  And she told not</a>
<a id='line_3489'>then to Geraint any of the conversation which she had had with the Earl,</a>
<a id='line_3490'>lest it should rouse his anger, and cause him uneasiness and care.</a>
<a id='line_3491'></a>
<a id='line_3492'>And at the usual hour they went to sleep.  And at the beginning of the</a>
<a id='line_3493'>night Enid slept a little; and at midnight she arose, and placed all</a>
<a id='line_3494'>Geraint’s armour together, so that it might be ready to put on.  And</a>
<a id='line_3495'>although fearful of her errand, she came to the side of Geraint’s bed;</a>
<a id='line_3496'>and she spoke to him softly and gently, saying, “My Lord, arise, and</a>
<a id='line_3497'>clothe thyself, for these were the words of the Earl to me, and his</a>
<a id='line_3498'>intention concerning me.”  So she told Geraint all that had passed.  And</a>
<a id='line_3499'>although he was wroth with her, he took warning, and clothed himself.</a>
<a id='line_3500'>And she lighted a candle, that he might have light to do so.  “Leave</a>
<a id='line_3501'>there the candle,” said he, “and desire the man of the house to come</a>
<a id='line_3502'>here.”  Then she went, and the man of the house came to him.  “Dost thou</a>
<a id='line_3503'>know how much I owe thee?” asked Geraint.  “I think thou owest but</a>
<a id='line_3504'>little.”  “Take the eleven horses and the eleven suits of armour.”</a>
<a id='line_3505'>“Heaven reward thee, lord,” said he, “but I spent not the value of one</a>
<a id='line_3506'>suit of armour upon thee.”  “For that reason,” said he, “thou wilt be the</a>
<a id='line_3507'>richer.  And now, wilt thou come to guide me out of the town?”  “I will,</a>
<a id='line_3508'>gladly,” said he, “and in which direction dost thou intend to go?”  “I</a>
<a id='line_3509'>wish to leave the town by a different way from that by which I entered</a>
<a id='line_3510'>it.”  So the man of the lodgings accompanied him as far as he desired.</a>
<a id='line_3511'>Then he bade the maiden to go on before him; and she did so, and went</a>
<a id='line_3512'>straight forward, and his host returned home.  And he had only just</a>
<a id='line_3513'>reached his house, when, behold, the greatest tumult approached that was</a>
<a id='line_3514'>ever heard.  And when he looked out, he saw fourscore knights in complete</a>
<a id='line_3515'>armour around the house, with the Earl Dwnn at their head.  “Where is the</a>
<a id='line_3516'>knight that was here?” said the Earl.  “By thy hand,” said he, “he went</a>
<a id='line_3517'>hence some time ago.”  “Wherefore, villain,” said he, “didst thou let him</a>
<a id='line_3518'>go without informing me?”  “My Lord, thou didst not command me to do so,</a>
<a id='line_3519'>else would I not have allowed him to depart.”  “What way dost thou think</a>
<a id='line_3520'>that he took?”  “I know not, except that he went along the high road.”</a>
<a id='line_3521'>And they turned their horses’ heads that way, and seeing the tracks of</a>
<a id='line_3522'>the horses upon the high road, they followed.  And when the maiden beheld</a>
<a id='line_3523'>the dawning of the day, she looked behind her, and saw vast clouds of</a>
<a id='line_3524'>dust coming nearer and nearer to her.  And thereupon she became uneasy,</a>
<a id='line_3525'>and she thought that it was the Earl and his host coming after them.  And</a>
<a id='line_3526'>thereupon she beheld a knight appearing through the mist.  “By my faith,”</a>
<a id='line_3527'>said she, “though he should slay me, it were better for me to receive my</a>
<a id='line_3528'>death at his hands, than to see him killed without warning him.  My</a>
<a id='line_3529'>Lord,” she said to him, “seest thou yonder man hastening after thee, and</a>
<a id='line_3530'>many others with him?”  “I do see him,” said he; “and in despite of all</a>
<a id='line_3531'>my orders, I see that thou wilt never keep silence.”  Then he turned upon</a>
<a id='line_3532'>the knight, and with the first thrust he threw him down under his horse’s</a>
<a id='line_3533'>feet.  And as long as there remained one of the fourscore knights, he</a>
<a id='line_3534'>overthrew every one of them at the first onset.  And from the weakest to</a>
<a id='line_3535'>the strongest, they all attacked him one after the other, except the</a>
<a id='line_3536'>Earl: and last of all the Earl came against him also.  And he broke his</a>
<a id='line_3537'>lance, and then he broke a second.  But Geraint turned upon him, and</a>
<a id='line_3538'>struck him with his lance upon the centre of his shield, so that by that</a>
<a id='line_3539'>single thrust the shield was split, and all his armour broken, and he</a>
<a id='line_3540'>himself was brought over his horse’s crupper to the ground, and was in</a>
<a id='line_3541'>peril of his life.  And Geraint drew near to him; and at the noise of the</a>
<a id='line_3542'>trampling of his horse the Earl revived.  “Mercy, Lord,” said he to</a>
<a id='line_3543'>Geraint.  And Geraint granted him mercy.  But through the hardness of the</a>
<a id='line_3544'>ground where they had fallen, and the violence of the stroke which they</a>
<a id='line_3545'>had received, there was not a single knight amongst them that escaped</a>
<a id='line_3546'>without receiving a fall, mortally severe, and grievously painful, and</a>
<a id='line_3547'>desperately wounding, from the hand of Geraint.</a>
<a id='line_3548'></a>
<a id='line_3549'>And Geraint journeyed along the high road that was before him, and the</a>
<a id='line_3550'>maiden went on first; and near them they beheld a valley which was the</a>
<a id='line_3551'>fairest ever seen, and which had a large river running through it; and</a>
<a id='line_3552'>there was a bridge over the river, and the high road led to the bridge.</a>
<a id='line_3553'>And above the bridge upon the opposite side of the river, they beheld a</a>
<a id='line_3554'>fortified town, the fairest ever seen.  And as they approached the</a>
<a id='line_3555'>bridge, Geraint saw coming towards him from a thick copse a man mounted</a>
<a id='line_3556'>upon a large and lofty steed, even of pace and spirited though tractable.</a>
<a id='line_3557'>“Ah, knight,” said Geraint, “whence comest thou?”  “I come,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_3558'>“from the valley below us.”  “Canst thou tell me,” said Geraint, “who is</a>
<a id='line_3559'>the owner of this fair valley and yonder walled town?”  “I will tell</a>
<a id='line_3560'>thee, willingly,” said he.  “Gwiffert Petit he is called by the Franks,</a>
<a id='line_3561'>but the Cymry call him the Little King.”  “Can I go by yonder bridge,”</a>
<a id='line_3562'>said Geraint, “and by the lower highway that is beneath the town?”  Said</a>
<a id='line_3563'>the knight, “Thou canst not go by his tower on the other side of the</a>
<a id='line_3564'>bridge, unless thou dost intend to combat him; because it is his custom</a>
<a id='line_3565'>to encounter every knight that comes upon his lands.”  “I declare to</a>
<a id='line_3566'>Heaven,” said Geraint, “that I will, nevertheless, pursue my journey that</a>
<a id='line_3567'>way.”  “If thou dost so,” said the knight, “thou wilt probably meet with</a>
<a id='line_3568'>shame and disgrace in reward for thy daring.”  Then Geraint proceeded</a>
<a id='line_3569'>along the road that led to the town, and the road brought him to a ground</a>
<a id='line_3570'>that was hard, and rugged, and high, and ridgy.  And as he journeyed</a>
<a id='line_3571'>thus, he beheld a knight following him upon a warhorse, strong, and</a>
<a id='line_3572'>large, and proudly-stepping, and wide-hoofed, and broad-chested.  And he</a>
<a id='line_3573'>never saw a man of smaller stature than he who was upon the horse.  And</a>
<a id='line_3574'>both he and his horse were completely armed.  When he had overtaken</a>
<a id='line_3575'>Geraint, he said to him, “Tell me, chieftain, whether it is through</a>
<a id='line_3576'>ignorance or through presumption that thou seekest to insult my dignity,</a>
<a id='line_3577'>and to infringe my rules.”  “Nay,” answered Geraint, “I knew not this</a>
<a id='line_3578'>road was forbid to any.”  “Thou didst know it,” said the other; “come</a>
<a id='line_3579'>with me to my Court, to give me satisfaction.”  “That will I not, by my</a>
<a id='line_3580'>faith,” said Geraint; “I would not go even to thy Lord’s Court, excepting</a>
<a id='line_3581'>Arthur were thy Lord.”  “By the hand of Arthur himself,” said the knight,</a>
<a id='line_3582'>“I will have satisfaction of thee, or receive my overthrow at thy hands.”</a>
<a id='line_3583'>And immediately they charged one another.  And a squire of his came to</a>
<a id='line_3584'>serve him with lances as he broke them.  And they gave each other such</a>
<a id='line_3585'>hard and severe strokes that their shields lost all their colour.  But it</a>
<a id='line_3586'>was very difficult for Geraint to fight with him on account of his small</a>
<a id='line_3587'>size, for he was hardly able to get a full aim at him with all the</a>
<a id='line_3588'>efforts he could make.  And they fought thus until their horses were</a>
<a id='line_3589'>brought down upon their knees; and at length Geraint threw the knight</a>
<a id='line_3590'>headlong to the ground; and then they fought on foot, and they gave one</a>
<a id='line_3591'>another blows so boldly fierce, so frequent, and so severely powerful,</a>
<a id='line_3592'>that their helmets were pierced, and their skullcaps were broken, and</a>
<a id='line_3593'>their arms were shattered, and the light of their eyes was darkened by</a>
<a id='line_3594'>sweat and blood.  At the last Geraint became enraged, and he called to</a>
<a id='line_3595'>him all his strength; and boldly angry, and swiftly resolute, and</a>
<a id='line_3596'>furiously determined, he lifted up his sword, and struck him on the crown</a>
<a id='line_3597'>of his head a blow so mortally painful, so violent, so fierce, and so</a>
<a id='line_3598'>penetrating, that it cut through all his head armour, and his skin, and</a>
<a id='line_3599'>his flesh, until it wounded the very bone, and the sword flew out of the</a>
<a id='line_3600'>hand of the Little King to the furthest end of the plain, and he besought</a>
<a id='line_3601'>Geraint that he would have mercy and compassion upon him.  “Though thou</a>
<a id='line_3602'>hast been neither courteous nor just,” said Geraint, “thou shalt have</a>
<a id='line_3603'>mercy, upon condition that thou wilt become my ally, and engage never to</a>
<a id='line_3604'>fight against me again, but to come to my assistance whenever thou</a>
<a id='line_3605'>hearest of my being in trouble.”  “This will I do, gladly, Lord,” said</a>
<a id='line_3606'>he.  So he pledged him his faith thereof.  “And now, Lord, come with me,”</a>
<a id='line_3607'>said he, “to my Court yonder, to recover from thy weariness and fatigue.”</a>
<a id='line_3608'>“That will I not, by Heaven,” said he.</a>
<a id='line_3609'></a>
<a id='line_3610'>Then Gwiffert Petit beheld Enid where she stood, and it grieved him to</a>
<a id='line_3611'>see one of her noble mien appear so deeply afflicted.  And he said to</a>
<a id='line_3612'>Geraint, “My Lord, thou doest wrong not to take repose, and refresh</a>
<a id='line_3613'>thyself awhile; for, if thou meetest with any difficulty in thy present</a>
<a id='line_3614'>condition, it will not be easy for thee to surmount it.”  But Geraint</a>
<a id='line_3615'>would do no other than proceed on his journey, and he mounted his horse</a>
<a id='line_3616'>in pain, and all covered with blood.  And the maiden went on first, and</a>
<a id='line_3617'>they proceeded towards the wood which they saw before them.</a>
<a id='line_3618'></a>
<a id='line_3619'>And the heat of the sun was very great, and through the blood and sweat,</a>
<a id='line_3620'>Geraint’s armour cleaved to his flesh; and when they came into the wood,</a>
<a id='line_3621'>he stood under a tree, to avoid the sun’s heat; and his wounds pained him</a>
<a id='line_3622'>more than they had done at the time when he received them.  And the</a>
<a id='line_3623'>maiden stood under another tree.  And lo! they heard the sound of horns,</a>
<a id='line_3624'>and a tumultuous noise; and the occasion of it was, that Arthur and his</a>
<a id='line_3625'>company had come down to the wood.  And while Geraint was considering</a>
<a id='line_3626'>which way he should go to avoid them, behold, he was espied by a</a>
<a id='line_3627'>foot-page, who was an attendant on the Steward of the Household; and he</a>
<a id='line_3628'>went to the Steward, and told him what kind of man he had seen in the</a>
<a id='line_3629'>wood.  Then the Steward caused his horse to be saddled, and he took his</a>
<a id='line_3630'>lance and his shield, and went to the place where Geraint was.  “Ah,</a>
<a id='line_3631'>knight!” said he, “what dost thou here?”  “I am standing under a shady</a>
<a id='line_3632'>tree, to avoid the heat and the rays of the sun.”  “Wherefore is thy</a>
<a id='line_3633'>journey, and who art thou?”  “I seek adventures, and go where I list.”</a>
<a id='line_3634'>“Indeed,” said Kai; “then come with me to see Arthur, who is here hard</a>
<a id='line_3635'>by.”  “That will I not, by Heaven,” said Geraint.  “Thou must needs</a>
<a id='line_3636'>come,” said Kai.  Then Geraint knew who he was, but Kai did not know</a>
<a id='line_3637'>Geraint.  And Kai attacked Geraint as best he could.  And Geraint became</a>
<a id='line_3638'>wroth, and he struck him with the shaft of his lance, so that he rolled</a>
<a id='line_3639'>headlong to the ground.  But chastisement worse than this would he not</a>
<a id='line_3640'>inflict on him.</a>
<a id='line_3641'></a>
<a id='line_3642'>Scared and wildly Kai arose, and he mounted his horse, and went back to</a>
<a id='line_3643'>his lodging.  And thence he proceeded to Gwalchmai’s tent.  “Oh, Sir,”</a>
<a id='line_3644'>said he to Gwalchmai, “I was told by one of the attendants, that he saw</a>
<a id='line_3645'>in the wood above a wounded knight, having on battered armour; and if</a>
<a id='line_3646'>thou dost right, thou wilt go and see if this be true.”  “I care not if I</a>
<a id='line_3647'>do so,” said Gwalchmai.  “Take, then, thy horse, and some of thy armour,”</a>
<a id='line_3648'>said Kai; “for I hear that he is not over courteous to those who approach</a>
<a id='line_3649'>him.”  So Gwalchmai took his spear and his shield, and mounted his horse,</a>
<a id='line_3650'>and came to the spot where Geraint was.  “Sir Knight,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_3651'>“wherefore is thy journey?”  “I journey for my own pleasure, and to seek</a>
<a id='line_3652'>the adventures of the world.”  “Wilt thou tell me who thou art; or wilt</a>
<a id='line_3653'>thou come and visit Arthur, who is near at hand?”  “I will make no</a>
<a id='line_3654'>alliance with thee, nor will I go and visit Arthur,” said he.  And he</a>
<a id='line_3655'>knew that it was Gwalchmai, but Gwalchmai knew him not.  “I purpose not</a>
<a id='line_3656'>to leave thee,” said Gwalchmai, “till I know who thou art.”  And he</a>
<a id='line_3657'>charged him with his lance, and struck him on his shield, so that the</a>
<a id='line_3658'>shaft was shivered into splinters, and their horses were front to front.</a>
<a id='line_3659'>Then Gwalchmai gazed fixedly upon him, and he knew him.  “Ah, Geraint,”</a>
<a id='line_3660'>said he, “is it thou that art here?”  “I am not Geraint,” said he.</a>
<a id='line_3661'>“Geraint thou art, by Heaven,” he replied, “and a wretched and insane</a>
<a id='line_3662'>expedition is this.”  Then he looked around, and beheld Enid, and he</a>
<a id='line_3663'>welcomed her gladly.  “Geraint,” said Gwalchmai, “come thou and see</a>
<a id='line_3664'>Arthur; he is thy lord and thy cousin.”  “I will not,” said he, “for I am</a>
<a id='line_3665'>not in a fit state to go and see any one.”  Thereupon, behold, one of the</a>
<a id='line_3666'>pages came after Gwalchmai to speak to him.  So he sent him to apprise</a>
<a id='line_3667'>Arthur that Geraint was there wounded, and that he would not go to visit</a>
<a id='line_3668'>him, and that it was pitiable to see the plight that he was in.  And this</a>
<a id='line_3669'>he did without Geraint’s knowledge, inasmuch as he spoke in a whisper to</a>
<a id='line_3670'>the page.  “Entreat Arthur,” said he, “to have his tent brought near to</a>
<a id='line_3671'>the road, for he will not meet him willingly, and it is not easy to</a>
<a id='line_3672'>compel him in the mood he is in.”  So the page came to Arthur, and told</a>
<a id='line_3673'>him this.  And he caused his tent to be removed unto the side of the</a>
<a id='line_3674'>road.  And the maiden rejoiced in her heart.  And Gwalchmai led Geraint</a>
<a id='line_3675'>onwards along the road, till they came to the place where Arthur was</a>
<a id='line_3676'>encamped, and the pages were pitching his tent by the roadside.  “Lord,”</a>
<a id='line_3677'>said Geraint, “all hail unto thee.”  “Heaven prosper thee; and who art</a>
<a id='line_3678'>thou?” said Arthur.  “It is Geraint,” said Gwalchmai, “and of his own</a>
<a id='line_3679'>free will would he not come to meet thee.”  “Verily,” said Arthur, “he is</a>
<a id='line_3680'>bereft of his reason.”  Then came Enid, and saluted Arthur.  “Heaven</a>
<a id='line_3681'>protect thee,” said he.  And thereupon he caused one of the pages to take</a>
<a id='line_3682'>her from her horse.  “Alas! Enid,” said Arthur, “what expedition is</a>
<a id='line_3683'>this?”  “I know not, Lord,” said she, “save that it behoves me to journey</a>
<a id='line_3684'>by the same road that he journeys.”  “My Lord,” said Geraint, “with thy</a>
<a id='line_3685'>permission we will depart.”  “Whither wilt thou go?” said Arthur.  “Thou</a>
<a id='line_3686'>canst not proceed now, unless it be unto thy death.”  “He will not suffer</a>
<a id='line_3687'>himself to be invited by me,” said Gwalchmai.  “But by me he will,” said</a>
<a id='line_3688'>Arthur; “and, moreover, he does not go from here until he is healed.”  “I</a>
<a id='line_3689'>had rather, Lord,” said Geraint, “that thou wouldest let me go forth.”</a>
<a id='line_3690'>“That will I not, I declare to Heaven,” said he.  Then he caused a maiden</a>
<a id='line_3691'>to be sent for to conduct Enid to the tent where Gwenhwyvar’s chamber</a>
<a id='line_3692'>was.  And Gwenhwyvar and all her women were joyful at her coming; and</a>
<a id='line_3693'>they took off her riding-dress, and placed other garments upon her.</a>
<a id='line_3694'>Arthur also called Kadyrieith, and ordered him to pitch a tent for</a>
<a id='line_3695'>Geraint and the physicians; and he enjoined him to provide him with</a>
<a id='line_3696'>abundance of all that might be requisite for him.  And Kadyrieith did as</a>
<a id='line_3697'>he had commanded him.  And Morgan Tud and his disciples were brought to</a>
<a id='line_3698'>Geraint.</a>
<a id='line_3699'></a>
<a id='line_3700'>And Arthur and his hosts remained there nearly a month, whilst Geraint</a>
<a id='line_3701'>was being healed.  And when he was fully recovered, Geraint came to</a>
<a id='line_3702'>Arthur, and asked his permission to depart.  “I know not if thou art</a>
<a id='line_3703'>quite well.”  “In truth I am, Lord,” said Geraint.  “I shall not believe</a>
<a id='line_3704'>thee concerning that, but the physicians that were with thee.”  So Arthur</a>
<a id='line_3705'>caused the physicians to be summoned to him, and asked them if it were</a>
<a id='line_3706'>true.  “It is true, Lord,” said Morgan Tud.  So the next day Arthur</a>
<a id='line_3707'>permitted him to go forth, and he pursued his journey.  And on the same</a>
<a id='line_3708'>day Arthur removed thence.  And Geraint desired Enid to go on, and to</a>
<a id='line_3709'>keep before him, as she had formerly done.  And she went forward along</a>
<a id='line_3710'>the high road.  And as they journeyed thus, they heard an exceeding loud</a>
<a id='line_3711'>wailing near to them.  “Stay thou here,” said he, “and I will go and see</a>
<a id='line_3712'>what is the cause of this wailing.”  “I will,” said she.  Then he went</a>
<a id='line_3713'>forward unto an open glade that was near the road.  And in the glade he</a>
<a id='line_3714'>saw two horses, one having a man’s saddle, and the other a woman’s saddle</a>
<a id='line_3715'>upon it.  And, behold, there was a knight lying dead in his armour, and a</a>
<a id='line_3716'>young damsel in a riding-dress standing over him, lamenting.  “Ah! Lady,”</a>
<a id='line_3717'>said Geraint, “what hath befallen thee?”  “Behold,” she answered, “I</a>
<a id='line_3718'>journeyed here with my beloved husband, when, lo! three giants came upon</a>
<a id='line_3719'>us, and without any cause in the world, they slew him.”  “Which way went</a>
<a id='line_3720'>they hence?” said Geraint.  “Yonder by the high road,” she replied.  So</a>
<a id='line_3721'>he returned to Enid.  “Go,” said he, “to the lady that is below yonder,</a>
<a id='line_3722'>and await me there till I come.”  She was sad when he ordered her to do</a>
<a id='line_3723'>thus, but nevertheless she went to the damsel, whom it was ruth to hear,</a>
<a id='line_3724'>and she felt certain that Geraint would never return.  Meanwhile Geraint</a>
<a id='line_3725'>followed the giants, and overtook them.  And each of them was greater of</a>
<a id='line_3726'>stature than three other men, and a huge club was on the shoulder of</a>
<a id='line_3727'>each.  Then he rushed upon one of them, and thrust his lance through his</a>
<a id='line_3728'>body.  And having drawn it forth again, he pierced another of them</a>
<a id='line_3729'>through likewise.  But the third turned upon him, and struck him with his</a>
<a id='line_3730'>club, so that he split his shield, and crushed his shoulder, and opened</a>
<a id='line_3731'>his wounds anew, and all his blood began to flow from him.  But Geraint</a>
<a id='line_3732'>drew his sword, and attacked the giant, and gave him a blow on the crown</a>
<a id='line_3733'>of his head so severe, and fierce, and violent, that his head and his</a>
<a id='line_3734'>neck were split down to his shoulders, and he fell dead.  So Geraint left</a>
<a id='line_3735'>him thus, and returned to Enid.  And when he saw her, he fell down</a>
<a id='line_3736'>lifeless from his horse.  Piercing, and loud, and thrilling was the cry</a>
<a id='line_3737'>that Enid uttered.  And she came and stood over him where he had fallen.</a>
<a id='line_3738'>And at the sound of her cries came the Earl of Limours, and the host that</a>
<a id='line_3739'>journeyed with him, whom her lamentations brought out of their road.  And</a>
<a id='line_3740'>the Earl said to Enid, “Alas, Lady, what hath befallen thee?”  “Ah! good</a>
<a id='line_3741'>Sir,” said she, “the only man I have loved, or ever shall love, is</a>
<a id='line_3742'>slain.”  Then he said to the other, “And what is the cause of thy grief?”</a>
<a id='line_3743'>“They have slain my beloved husband also,” said she.  “And who was it</a>
<a id='line_3744'>that slew them?”  “Some giants,” she answered, “slew my best-beloved, and</a>
<a id='line_3745'>the other knight went in pursuit of them, and came back in the state thou</a>
<a id='line_3746'>seest, his blood flowing excessively; but it appears to me that he did</a>
<a id='line_3747'>not leave the giants without killing some of them, if not all.”  The Earl</a>
<a id='line_3748'>caused the knight that was dead to be buried, but he thought that there</a>
<a id='line_3749'>still remained some life in Geraint; and to see if he yet would live, he</a>
<a id='line_3750'>had him carried with him in the hollow of his shield, and upon a bier.</a>
<a id='line_3751'>And the two damsels went to the Court; and when they arrived there,</a>
<a id='line_3752'>Geraint was placed upon a litter-couch in front of the table that was in</a>
<a id='line_3753'>the hall.  Then they all took off their travelling gear, and the Earl</a>
<a id='line_3754'>besought Enid to do the same, and to clothe herself in other garments.</a>
<a id='line_3755'>“I will not, by Heaven,” said she.  “Ah! Lady,” said he, “be not so</a>
<a id='line_3756'>sorrowful for this matter.”  “It were hard to persuade me to be</a>
<a id='line_3757'>otherwise,” said she.  “I will act towards thee in such wise, that thou</a>
<a id='line_3758'>needest not be sorrowful, whether yonder knight live or die.  Behold, a</a>
<a id='line_3759'>good Earldom, together with myself, will I bestow on thee; be, therefore,</a>
<a id='line_3760'>happy and joyful.”  “I declare to Heaven,” said she, “that henceforth I</a>
<a id='line_3761'>shall never be joyful while I live.”  “Come, then,” said he, “and eat.”</a>
<a id='line_3762'>“No, by Heaven, I will not,” she answered.  “But, by Heaven, thou shalt,”</a>
<a id='line_3763'>said he.  So he took her with him to the table against her will, and many</a>
<a id='line_3764'>times desired her to eat.  “I call Heaven to witness,” said she, “that I</a>
<a id='line_3765'>will not eat until the man that is upon yonder bier shall eat likewise.”</a>
<a id='line_3766'>“Thou canst not fulfil that,” said the Earl, “yonder man is dead</a>
<a id='line_3767'>already.”  “I will prove that I can,” said she.  Then he offered her a</a>
<a id='line_3768'>goblet of liquor.  “Drink this goblet,” he said, “and it will cause thee</a>
<a id='line_3769'>to change thy mind.”  “Evil betide me,” she answered, “if I drink aught</a>
<a id='line_3770'>until he drink also.”  “Truly,” said the Earl, “it is of no more avail</a>
<a id='line_3771'>for me to be gentle with thee than ungentle.”  And he gave her a box on</a>
<a id='line_3772'>the ear.  Thereupon she raised a loud and piercing shriek, and her</a>
<a id='line_3773'>lamentations were much greater than they had been before, for she</a>
<a id='line_3774'>considered in her mind that had Geraint been alive, he durst not have</a>
<a id='line_3775'>struck her thus.  But, behold, at the sound of her cry, Geraint revived</a>
<a id='line_3776'>from his swoon, and he sat up on the bier, and finding his sword in the</a>
<a id='line_3777'>hollow of his shield, he rushed to the place where the Earl was, and</a>
<a id='line_3778'>struck him a fiercely-wounding, severely-venomous, and sternly-smiting</a>
<a id='line_3779'>blow upon the crown of his head, so that he clove him in twain, until his</a>
<a id='line_3780'>sword was stayed by the table.  Then all left the board, and fled away.</a>
<a id='line_3781'>And this was not so much through fear of the living as through the dread</a>
<a id='line_3782'>they felt at seeing the dead man rise up to slay them.  And Geraint</a>
<a id='line_3783'>looked upon Enid, and he was grieved for two causes; one was, to see that</a>
<a id='line_3784'>Enid had lost her colour and her wonted aspect, and the other, to know</a>
<a id='line_3785'>that she was in the right.  “Lady,” said he, “knowest thou where our</a>
<a id='line_3786'>horses are?”  “I know, Lord, where thy horse is,” she replied, “but I</a>
<a id='line_3787'>know not where is the other.  Thy horse is in the house yonder.”  So he</a>
<a id='line_3788'>went to the house, and brought forth his horse, and mounted him, and took</a>
<a id='line_3789'>up Enid from the ground, and placed her upon the horse with him.  And he</a>
<a id='line_3790'>rode forward.  And their road lay between two hedges.  And the night was</a>
<a id='line_3791'>gaining on the day.  And lo! they saw behind them the shafts of spears</a>
<a id='line_3792'>betwixt them and the sky, and they heard the trampling of horses, and the</a>
<a id='line_3793'>noise of a host approaching.  “I hear something following us,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_3794'>“and I will put thee on the other side of the hedge.”  And thus he did.</a>
<a id='line_3795'>And thereupon, behold, a knight pricked towards him, and couched his</a>
<a id='line_3796'>lance.  When Enid saw this, she cried out, saying, “Oh! chieftain,</a>
<a id='line_3797'>whoever thou art, what renown wilt thou gain by slaying a dead man?”</a>
<a id='line_3798'>“Oh! Heaven,” said he, “is it Geraint?”  “Yes, in truth,” said she.  “And</a>
<a id='line_3799'>who art thou?”  “I am the Little King,” he answered, “coming to thy</a>
<a id='line_3800'>assistance, for I heard that thou wast in trouble.  And if thou hadst</a>
<a id='line_3801'>followed my advice, none of these hardships would have befallen thee.”</a>
<a id='line_3802'>“Nothing can happen,” said Geraint, “without the will of Heaven, though</a>
<a id='line_3803'>much good results from counsel.”  “Yes,” said the Little King, “and I</a>
<a id='line_3804'>know good counsel for thee now.  Come with me to the court of a</a>
<a id='line_3805'>son-in-law of my sister, which is near here, and thou shalt have the best</a>
<a id='line_3806'>medical assistance in the kingdom.”  “I will do so gladly,” said Geraint.</a>
<a id='line_3807'>And Enid was placed upon the horse of one of the Little King’s squires,</a>
<a id='line_3808'>and they went forward to the Baron’s palace.  And they were received</a>
<a id='line_3809'>there with gladness, and they met with hospitality and attention.  And</a>
<a id='line_3810'>the next morning they went to seek physicians; and it was not long before</a>
<a id='line_3811'>they came, and they attended Geraint until he was perfectly well.  And</a>
<a id='line_3812'>while Geraint was under medical care, the Little King caused his armour</a>
<a id='line_3813'>to be repaired, until it was as good as it had ever been.  And they</a>
<a id='line_3814'>remained there a fortnight and a month.</a>
<a id='line_3815'></a>
<a id='line_3816'>Then the Little King said to Geraint, “Now will we go towards my own</a>
<a id='line_3817'>Court, to take rest, and amuse ourselves.”  “Not so,” said Geraint, “we</a>
<a id='line_3818'>will first journey for one day more, and return again.”  “With all my</a>
<a id='line_3819'>heart,” said the Little King, “do thou go then.”  And early in the day</a>
<a id='line_3820'>they set forth.  And more gladly and more joyfully did Enid journey with</a>
<a id='line_3821'>them that day than she had ever done.  And they came to the main road.</a>
<a id='line_3822'>And when they reached a place where the road divided in two, they beheld</a>
<a id='line_3823'>a man on foot coming towards them along one of these roads, and Gwiffert</a>
<a id='line_3824'>asked the man whence he came.  “I come,” said he, “from an errand in the</a>
<a id='line_3825'>country.”  “Tell me,” said Geraint, “which is the best for me to follow</a>
<a id='line_3826'>of these two roads?”  “That is the best for thee to follow,” answered he,</a>
<a id='line_3827'>“for if thou goest by this one, thou wilt never return.  Below us,” said</a>
<a id='line_3828'>he, “there is a hedge of mist, and within it are enchanted games, and no</a>
<a id='line_3829'>one who has gone there has ever returned.  And the Court of the Earl</a>
<a id='line_3830'>Owain is there, and he permits no one to go to lodge in the town, except</a>
<a id='line_3831'>he will go to his Court.”  “I declare to Heaven,” said Geraint, “that we</a>
<a id='line_3832'>will take the lower road.”  And they went along it until they came to the</a>
<a id='line_3833'>town.  And they took the fairest and pleasantest place in the town for</a>
<a id='line_3834'>their lodging.  And while they were thus, behold, a young man came to</a>
<a id='line_3835'>them, and greeted them.  “Heaven be propitious to thee,” said they.</a>
<a id='line_3836'>“Good Sirs,” said he, “what preparations are you making here?”  “We are</a>
<a id='line_3837'>taking up our lodging,” said they, “to pass the night.”  “It is not the</a>
<a id='line_3838'>custom with him who owns the town,” he answered, “to permit any of gentle</a>
<a id='line_3839'>birth, unless they come to stay in his Court, to abide here; therefore,</a>
<a id='line_3840'>come ye to the Court.”  “We will come, gladly,” said Geraint.  And they</a>
<a id='line_3841'>went with the page, and they were joyfully received.  And the Earl came</a>
<a id='line_3842'>to the hall to meet them, and he commanded the tables to be laid.  And</a>
<a id='line_3843'>they washed, and sat down.  And this is the order in which they sat:</a>
<a id='line_3844'>Geraint on one side of the Earl, and Enid on the other side, and next to</a>
<a id='line_3845'>Enid the Little King, and then the Countess next to Geraint; and all</a>
<a id='line_3846'>after that as became their rank.  Then Geraint recollected the games, and</a>
<a id='line_3847'>thought that he should not go to them; and on that account he did not</a>
<a id='line_3848'>eat.  Then the Earl looked upon Geraint, and considered, and he bethought</a>
<a id='line_3849'>him that his not eating was because of the games, and it grieved him that</a>
<a id='line_3850'>he had ever established those games, were it only on account of losing</a>
<a id='line_3851'>such a youth as Geraint.  And if Geraint had asked him to abolish the</a>
<a id='line_3852'>games, he would gladly have done so.  Then the Earl said to Geraint,</a>
<a id='line_3853'>“What thought occupies thy mind, that thou dost not eat?  If thou</a>
<a id='line_3854'>hesitatest about going to the games, thou shalt not go, and no other of</a>
<a id='line_3855'>thy rank shall ever go either.”  “Heaven reward thee,” said Geraint, “but</a>
<a id='line_3856'>I wish nothing better than to go to the games, and to be shown the way</a>
<a id='line_3857'>thither.”  “If that is what thou dost prefer, thou shalt obtain it</a>
<a id='line_3858'>willingly.”  “I do prefer it, indeed,” said he.  Then they ate, and they</a>
<a id='line_3859'>were amply served, and they had a variety of gifts, and abundance of</a>
<a id='line_3860'>liquor.  And when they had finished eating they arose.  And Geraint</a>
<a id='line_3861'>called for his horse and his armour, and he accoutred both himself and</a>
<a id='line_3862'>his horse.  And all the hosts went forth until they came to the side of</a>
<a id='line_3863'>the hedge, and the hedge was so lofty, that it reached as high as they</a>
<a id='line_3864'>could see in the air, and upon every stake in the hedge, except two,</a>
<a id='line_3865'>there was the head of a man, and the number of stakes throughout the</a>
<a id='line_3866'>hedge was very great.  Then said the Little King, “May no one go in with</a>
<a id='line_3867'>the chieftain?”  “No one may,” said Earl Owain.  “Which way can I enter?”</a>
<a id='line_3868'>inquired Geraint.  “I know not,” said Owain, “but enter by the way that</a>
<a id='line_3869'>thou wilt, and that seemeth easiest to thee.”</a>
<a id='line_3870'></a>
<a id='line_3871'>Then fearlessly and unhesitatingly Geraint dashed forward into the mist.</a>
<a id='line_3872'>And on leaving the mist, he came to a large orchard; and in the orchard</a>
<a id='line_3873'>he saw an open space, wherein was a tent of red satin; and the door of</a>
<a id='line_3874'>the tent was open, and an apple-tree stood in front of the door of the</a>
<a id='line_3875'>tent; and on a branch of the apple-tree hung a huge hunting-horn.  Then</a>
<a id='line_3876'>he dismounted, and went into the tent; and there was no one in the tent</a>
<a id='line_3877'>save one maiden sitting in a golden chair, and another chair was opposite</a>
<a id='line_3878'>to her, empty.  And Geraint went to the empty chair, and sat down</a>
<a id='line_3879'>therein.  “Ah! chieftain,” said the maiden, “I would not counsel thee to</a>
<a id='line_3880'>sit in that chair.”  “Wherefore?” said Geraint.  “The man to whom that</a>
<a id='line_3881'>chair belongs has never suffered another to sit in it.”  “I care not,”</a>
<a id='line_3882'>said Geraint, “though it displease him that I sit in the chair.”  And</a>
<a id='line_3883'>thereupon they heard a mighty tumult around the tent.  And Geraint looked</a>
<a id='line_3884'>to see what was the cause of the tumult.  And he beheld without a knight</a>
<a id='line_3885'>mounted upon a warhorse, proudly snorting, high-mettled, and large of</a>
<a id='line_3886'>bone; and a robe of honour in two parts was upon him and upon his horse,</a>
<a id='line_3887'>and beneath it was plenty of armour.  “Tell me, chieftain,” said he to</a>
<a id='line_3888'>Geraint, “who it was that bade thee sit there?”  “Myself,” answered he.</a>
<a id='line_3889'>“It was wrong of thee to do me this shame and disgrace.  Arise, and do me</a>
<a id='line_3890'>satisfaction for thine insolence.”  Then Geraint arose; and they</a>
<a id='line_3891'>encountered immediately; and they broke a set of lances, and a second</a>
<a id='line_3892'>set, and a third; and they gave each other fierce and frequent strokes;</a>
<a id='line_3893'>and at last Geraint became enraged, and he urged on his horse, and rushed</a>
<a id='line_3894'>upon him, and gave him a thrust on the centre of his shield, so that it</a>
<a id='line_3895'>was split, and so that the head of his lance went through his armour, and</a>
<a id='line_3896'>his girths were broken, and he himself was borne headlong to the ground</a>
<a id='line_3897'>the length of Geraint’s lance and arm, over his horse’s crupper.  “Oh, my</a>
<a id='line_3898'>Lord!” said he, “thy mercy, and thou shalt have what thou wilt.”  “I only</a>
<a id='line_3899'>desire,” said Geraint, “that this game shall no longer exist here, nor</a>
<a id='line_3900'>the hedge of mist, nor magic, nor enchantment.”  “Thou shalt have this</a>
<a id='line_3901'>gladly, Lord,” he replied.  “Cause, then, the mist to disappear from this</a>
<a id='line_3902'>place,” said Geraint.  “Sound yonder horn,” said he, “and when thou</a>
<a id='line_3903'>soundest it, the mist will vanish; but it will not go hence unless the</a>
<a id='line_3904'>horn be blown by the knight by whom I am vanquished.”  And sad and</a>
<a id='line_3905'>sorrowful was Enid where she remained, through anxiety concerning</a>
<a id='line_3906'>Geraint.  Then Geraint went and sounded the horn.  And at the first blast</a>
<a id='line_3907'>he gave, the mist vanished.  And all the hosts came together, and they</a>
<a id='line_3908'>all became reconciled to each other.  And the Earl invited Geraint and</a>
<a id='line_3909'>the Little King to stay with him that night.  And the next morning they</a>
<a id='line_3910'>separated.  And Geraint went towards his own dominions; and thenceforth</a>
<a id='line_3911'>he reigned prosperously, and his warlike fame and splendour lasted with</a>
<a id='line_3912'>renown and honour both to him and to Enid from that time forth.</a>
<a id='line_3913'></a>
<a id='line_3914'></a>
<a id='line_3915'></a>
<a id='line_3916'></a>
<a id='line_3917'>KILHWCH AND OLWEN</a>
<a id='line_3918'>OR THE</a>
<a id='line_3919'>TWRCH TRWYTH</a>
<a id='line_3920'></a>
<a id='line_3921'></a>
<a id='line_3922'>KILYDD the son of Prince Kelyddon desired a wife as a helpmate, and the</a>
<a id='line_3923'>wife that he chose was Goleuddydd, the daughter of Prince Anlawdd.  And</a>
<a id='line_3924'>after their union, the people put up prayers that they might have an</a>
<a id='line_3925'>heir.  And they had a son through the prayers of the people.  From the</a>
<a id='line_3926'>time of her pregnancy Goleuddydd became wild, and wandered about, without</a>
<a id='line_3927'>habitation; but when her delivery was at hand, her reason came back to</a>
<a id='line_3928'>her.  Then she went to a mountain where there was a swineherd, keeping a</a>
<a id='line_3929'>herd of swine.  And through fear of the swine the queen was delivered.</a>
<a id='line_3930'>And the swineherd took the boy, and brought him to the palace; and he was</a>
<a id='line_3931'>christened, and they called him Kilhwch, because he had been found in a</a>
<a id='line_3932'>swine’s burrow.  Nevertheless the boy was of gentle lineage, and cousin</a>
<a id='line_3933'>unto Arthur; and they put him out to nurse.</a>
<a id='line_3934'></a>
<a id='line_3935'>After this the boy’s mother, Goleuddydd, the daughter of Prince Anlawdd,</a>
<a id='line_3936'>fell sick.  Then she called her husband unto her, and said to him, “Of</a>
<a id='line_3937'>this sickness I shall die, and thou wilt take another wife.  Now wives</a>
<a id='line_3938'>are the gift of the Lord, but it would be wrong for thee to harm thy son.</a>
<a id='line_3939'>Therefore I charge thee that thou take not a wife until thou see a briar</a>
<a id='line_3940'>with two blossoms upon my grave.”  And this he promised her.  Then she</a>
<a id='line_3941'>besought him to dress her grave every year, that nothing might grow</a>
<a id='line_3942'>thereon.  So the queen died.  Now the king sent an attendant every</a>
<a id='line_3943'>morning to see if anything were growing upon the grave.  And at the end</a>
<a id='line_3944'>of the seventh year the master neglected that which he had promised to</a>
<a id='line_3945'>the queen.</a>
<a id='line_3946'></a>
<a id='line_3947'>One day the king went to hunt, and he rode to the place of burial to see</a>
<a id='line_3948'>the grave, and to know if it were time that he should take a wife; and</a>
<a id='line_3949'>the king saw the briar.  And when he saw it, the king took counsel where</a>
<a id='line_3950'>he should find a wife.  Said one of his counsellors, “I know a wife that</a>
<a id='line_3951'>will suit thee well, and she is the wife of King Doged.”  And they</a>
<a id='line_3952'>resolved to go to seek her; and they slew the king, and brought away his</a>
<a id='line_3953'>wife and one daughter that she had along with her.  And they conquered</a>
<a id='line_3954'>the king’s lands.</a>
<a id='line_3955'></a>
<a id='line_3956'>On a certain day, as the lady walked abroad, she came to the house of an</a>
<a id='line_3957'>old crone that dwelt in the town, and that had no tooth in her head.  And</a>
<a id='line_3958'>the queen said to her, “Old woman, tell me that which I shall ask thee,</a>
<a id='line_3959'>for the love of Heaven.  Where are the children of the man who has</a>
<a id='line_3960'>carried me away by violence?”  Said the crone, “He has not children.”</a>
<a id='line_3961'>Said the queen, “Woe is me, that I should have come to one who is</a>
<a id='line_3962'>childless!”  Then said the hag, “Thou needest not lament on account of</a>
<a id='line_3963'>that, for there is a prediction he shall have an heir by thee, and by</a>
<a id='line_3964'>none other.  Moreover, be not sorrowful, for he has one son.”</a>
<a id='line_3965'></a>
<a id='line_3966'>The lady returned home with joy; and she asked her consort, “Wherefore</a>
<a id='line_3967'>hast thou concealed thy children from me?”  The king said, “I will do so</a>
<a id='line_3968'>no longer.”  And he sent messengers for his son, and he was brought to</a>
<a id='line_3969'>the Court.  His stepmother said unto him, “It were well for thee to have</a>
<a id='line_3970'>a wife, and I have a daughter who is sought of every man of renown in the</a>
<a id='line_3971'>world.”  “I am not yet of an age to wed,” answered the youth.  Then said</a>
<a id='line_3972'>she unto him, “I declare to thee, that it is thy destiny not to be suited</a>
<a id='line_3973'>with a wife until thou obtain Olwen, the daughter of Yspaddaden Penkawr.”</a>
<a id='line_3974'>And the youth blushed, and the love of the maiden diffused itself through</a>
<a id='line_3975'>all his frame, although he had never seen her.  And his father inquired</a>
<a id='line_3976'>of him, “What has come over thee, my son, and what aileth thee?”  “My</a>
<a id='line_3977'>stepmother has declared to me that I shall never have a wife until I</a>
<a id='line_3978'>obtain Olwen, the daughter of Yspaddaden Penkawr.”  “That will be easy</a>
<a id='line_3979'>for thee,” answered his father.  “Arthur is thy cousin.  Go, therefore,</a>
<a id='line_3980'>unto Arthur, to cut thy hair, and ask this of him as a boon.”</a>
<a id='line_3981'></a>
<a id='line_3982'>And the youth pricked forth upon a steed with head dappled grey, of four</a>
<a id='line_3983'>winters old, firm of limb, with shell-formed hoofs, having a bridle of</a>
<a id='line_3984'>linked gold on his head, and upon him a saddle of costly gold.  And in</a>
<a id='line_3985'>the youth’s hand were two spears of silver, sharp, well-tempered, headed</a>
<a id='line_3986'>with steel, three ells in length, of an edge to wound the wind, and cause</a>
<a id='line_3987'>blood to flow, and swifter than the fall of the dewdrop from the blade of</a>
<a id='line_3988'>reed-grass upon the earth when the dew of June is at the heaviest.  A</a>
<a id='line_3989'>gold-hilted sword was upon his thigh, the blade of which was of gold,</a>
<a id='line_3990'>bearing a cross of inlaid gold of the hue of the lightning of heaven: his</a>
<a id='line_3991'>war-horn was of ivory.  Before him were two brindled white-breasted</a>
<a id='line_3992'>greyhounds, having strong collars of rubies about their necks, reaching</a>
<a id='line_3993'>from the shoulder to the ear.  And the one that was on the left side</a>
<a id='line_3994'>bounded across to the right side, and the one on the right to the left,</a>
<a id='line_3995'>and like two sea-swallows sported around him.  And his courser cast up</a>
<a id='line_3996'>four sods with his four hoofs, like four swallows in the air, about his</a>
<a id='line_3997'>head, now above, now below.  About him was a four-cornered cloth of</a>
<a id='line_3998'>purple, and an apple of gold was at each corner, and every one of the</a>
<a id='line_3999'>apples was of the value of an hundred kine.  And there was precious gold</a>
<a id='line_4000'>of the value of three hundred kine upon his shoes, and upon his stirrups,</a>
<a id='line_4001'>from his knee to the tip of his toe.  And the blade of grass bent not</a>
<a id='line_4002'>beneath him, so light was his courser’s tread as he journeyed towards the</a>
<a id='line_4003'>gate of Arthur’s Palace.</a>
<a id='line_4004'></a>
<a id='line_4005'>Spoke the youth, “Is there a porter?”  “There is; and if thou holdest not</a>
<a id='line_4006'>thy peace, small will be thy welcome.  I am Arthur’s porter every first</a>
<a id='line_4007'>day of January.  And during every other part of the year but this, the</a>
<a id='line_4008'>office is filled by Huandaw, and Gogigwc, and Llaeskenym, and</a>
<a id='line_4009'>Pennpingyon, who goes upon his head to save his feet, neither towards the</a>
<a id='line_4010'>sky nor towards the earth, but like a rolling stone upon the floor of the</a>
<a id='line_4011'>court.”  “Open the portal.”  “I will not open it.”  “Wherefore not?”</a>
<a id='line_4012'>“The knife is in the meat, and the drink is in the horn, and there is</a>
<a id='line_4013'>revelry in Arthur’s Hall, and none may enter therein but the son of a</a>
<a id='line_4014'>king of a privileged country, or a craftsman bringing his craft.  But</a>
<a id='line_4015'>there will be refreshment for thy dogs, and for thy horses; and for thee</a>
<a id='line_4016'>there will be collops cooked and peppered, and luscious wine and mirthful</a>
<a id='line_4017'>songs, and food for fifty men shall be brought unto thee in the guest</a>
<a id='line_4018'>chamber, where the stranger and the sons of other countries eat, who come</a>
<a id='line_4019'>not unto the precincts of the Palace of Arthur.  Thou wilt fare no worse</a>
<a id='line_4020'>there than thou wouldest with Arthur in the Court.  A lady shall smooth</a>
<a id='line_4021'>thy couch, and shall lull thee with songs; and early to-morrow morning,</a>
<a id='line_4022'>when the gate is open for the multitude that come hither to-day, for thee</a>
<a id='line_4023'>shall it be opened first, and thou mayest sit in the place that thou</a>
<a id='line_4024'>shalt choose in Arthur’s Hall, from the upper end to the lower.”  Said</a>
<a id='line_4025'>the youth, “That will I not do.  If thou openest the gate, it is well.</a>
<a id='line_4026'>If thou dost not open it, I will bring disgrace upon thy Lord, and evil</a>
<a id='line_4027'>report upon thee.  And I will set up three shouts at this very gate, than</a>
<a id='line_4028'>which none were ever more deadly, from the top of Pengwaed in Cornwall to</a>
<a id='line_4029'>the bottom of Dinsol, in the North, and to Esgair Oervel, in Ireland.</a>
<a id='line_4030'>And all the women in this Palace that are pregnant shall lose their</a>
<a id='line_4031'>offspring; and such as are not pregnant, their hearts shall be turned by</a>
<a id='line_4032'>illness, so that they shall never bear children from this day forward.”</a>
<a id='line_4033'>“What clamour soever thou mayest make,” said Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr,</a>
<a id='line_4034'>“against the laws of Arthur’s Palace shalt thou not enter therein, until</a>
<a id='line_4035'>I first go and speak with Arthur.”</a>
<a id='line_4036'></a>
<a id='line_4037'>Then Glewlwyd went into the Hall.  And Arthur said to him, “Hast thou</a>
<a id='line_4038'>news from the gate?”—“Half of my life is past, and half of thine.  I was</a>
<a id='line_4039'>heretofore in Kaer Se and Asse, in Sach and Salach, in Lotor and Fotor;</a>
<a id='line_4040'>and I have been heretofore in India the Great and India the Lesser; and I</a>
<a id='line_4041'>was in the battle of Dau Ynyr, when the twelve hostages were brought from</a>
<a id='line_4042'>Llychlyn.  And I have also been in Europe, and in Africa, and in the</a>
<a id='line_4043'>islands of Corsica, and in Caer Brythwch, and Brythach, and Verthach; and</a>
<a id='line_4044'>I was present when formerly thou didst slay the family of Clis the son of</a>
<a id='line_4045'>Merin, and when thou didst slay Mil Du the son of Ducum, and when thou</a>
<a id='line_4046'>didst conquer Greece in the East.  And I have been in Caer Oeth and</a>
<a id='line_4047'>Annoeth, and in Caer Nevenhyr; nine supreme sovereigns, handsome men, saw</a>
<a id='line_4048'>we there, but never did I behold a man of equal dignity with him who is</a>
<a id='line_4049'>now at the door of the portal.”  Then said Arthur, “If walking thou didst</a>
<a id='line_4050'>enter in here, return thou running.  And every one that beholds the</a>
<a id='line_4051'>light, and every one that opens and shuts the eye, let them shew him</a>
<a id='line_4052'>respect, and serve him, some with gold-mounted drinking-horns, others</a>
<a id='line_4053'>with collops cooked and peppered, until food and drink can be prepared</a>
<a id='line_4054'>for him.  It is unbecoming to keep such a man as thou sayest he is, in</a>
<a id='line_4055'>the wind and the rain.”  Said Kai, “By the hand of my friend, if thou</a>
<a id='line_4056'>wouldest follow my counsel, thou wouldest not break through the laws of</a>
<a id='line_4057'>the Court because of him.”  “Not so, blessed Kai.  It is an honour to us</a>
<a id='line_4058'>to be resorted to, and the greater our courtesy the greater will be our</a>
<a id='line_4059'>renown, and our fame, and our glory.”</a>
<a id='line_4060'></a>
<a id='line_4061'>And Glewlwyd came to the gate, and opened the gate before him; and</a>
<a id='line_4062'>although all dismounted upon the horseblock at the gate, yet did he not</a>
<a id='line_4063'>dismount, but rode in upon his charger.  Then said Kilhwch, “Greeting be</a>
<a id='line_4064'>unto thee, Sovereign Ruler of this Island; and be this greeting no less</a>
<a id='line_4065'>unto the lowest than unto the highest, and be it equally unto thy guests,</a>
<a id='line_4066'>and thy warriors, and thy chieftains—let all partake of it as completely</a>
<a id='line_4067'>as thyself.  And complete be thy favour, and thy fame, and thy glory,</a>
<a id='line_4068'>throughout all this Island.”  “Greeting unto thee also,” said Arthur;</a>
<a id='line_4069'>“sit thou between two of my warriors, and thou shalt have minstrels</a>
<a id='line_4070'>before thee, and thou shalt enjoy the privileges of a king born to a</a>
<a id='line_4071'>throne, as long as thou remainest here.  And when I dispense my presents</a>
<a id='line_4072'>to the visitors and strangers in this Court, they shall be in thy hand at</a>
<a id='line_4073'>my commencing.”  Said the youth, “I came not here to consume meat and</a>
<a id='line_4074'>drink; but if I obtain the boon that I seek, I will requite it thee, and</a>
<a id='line_4075'>extol thee; and if I have it not, I will bear forth thy dispraise to the</a>
<a id='line_4076'>four quarters of the world, as far as thy renown has extended.”  Then</a>
<a id='line_4077'>said Arthur, “Since thou wilt not remain here, chieftain, thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_4078'>receive the boon whatsoever thy tongue may name, as far as the wind</a>
<a id='line_4079'>dries, and the rain moistens, and the sun revolves, and the sea</a>
<a id='line_4080'>encircles, and the earth extends; save only my ship; and my mantle; and</a>
<a id='line_4081'>Caledvwlch, my sword; and Rhongomyant, my lance; and Wynebgwrthucher, my</a>
<a id='line_4082'>shield; and Carnwenhau, my dagger; and Gwenhwyvar, my wife.  By the truth</a>
<a id='line_4083'>of Heaven, thou shalt have it cheerfully, name what thou wilt.”  “I would</a>
<a id='line_4084'>that thou bless my hair.”  “That shall be granted thee.”</a>
<a id='line_4085'></a>
<a id='line_4086'>And Arthur took a golden comb, and scissors, whereof the loops were of</a>
<a id='line_4087'>silver, and he combed his hair.  And Arthur inquired of him who he was.</a>
<a id='line_4088'>“For my heart warms unto thee, and I know that thou art come of my blood.</a>
<a id='line_4089'>Tell me, therefore, who thou art.”  “I will tell thee,” said the youth.</a>
<a id='line_4090'>“I am Kilhwch, the son of Kilydd, the son of Prince Kelyddon, by</a>
<a id='line_4091'>Goleuddydd, my mother, the daughter of Prince Anlawdd.”  “That is true,”</a>
<a id='line_4092'>said Arthur; “thou art my cousin.  Whatsoever boon thou mayest ask, thou</a>
<a id='line_4093'>shalt receive, be it what it may that thy tongue shall name.”  “Pledge</a>
<a id='line_4094'>the truth of Heaven and the faith of thy kingdom thereof.”  “I pledge it</a>
<a id='line_4095'>thee, gladly.”  “I crave of thee then, that thou obtain for me Olwen, the</a>
<a id='line_4096'>daughter of Yspaddaden Penkawr; and this boon I likewise seek at the</a>
<a id='line_4097'>hands of thy warriors.  I seek it from Kai, and Bedwyr, and Greidawl</a>
<a id='line_4098'>Galldonyd, and Gwythyr the son of Greidawl, and Greid the son of Eri, and</a>
<a id='line_4099'>Kynddelig Kyvarwydd, and Tathal Twyll Goleu, and Maelwys the son of</a>
<a id='line_4100'>Baeddan, and Crychwr the son of Nes, and Cubert the son of Daere, and</a>

<a id='line_4261'>Gwiawn Llygad Cath (who could cut a haw from the eye of the gnat without</a>
<a id='line_4262'>hurting him).  Ol the son of Olwydd (seven years before he was born his</a>
<a id='line_4263'>father’s swine were carried off, and when he grew up a man he tracked the</a>
<a id='line_4264'>swine, and brought them back in seven herds).  Bedwini the Bishop (who</a>
<a id='line_4265'>blessed Arthur’s meat and drink).  For the sake of the golden-chained</a>
<a id='line_4266'>daughters of this island.  For the sake of Gwenhwyvar its chief lady, and</a>
<a id='line_4267'>Gwennhwyach her sister, and Rathtyeu the only daughter of Clemenhill, and</a>

<a id='line_4274'>Morvudd the daughter of Urien Rheged.  Gwenllian Deg the majestic maiden.</a>
<a id='line_4275'>Creiddylad the daughter of Lludd Llaw Ereint.  (She was the most splendid</a>
<a id='line_4276'>maiden in the three Islands of the mighty, and in the three Islands</a>
<a id='line_4277'>adjacent, and for her Gwythyr the son of Greidawl and Gwynn the son of</a>
<a id='line_4278'>Nudd fight every first of May until the day of doom.)  Ellylw the</a>
<a id='line_4279'>daughter of Neol Kynn-Crog (she lived three ages).  Essyllt Vinwen and</a>
<a id='line_4280'>Essyllt Vingul.”  And all these did Kilhwch the son of Kilydd adjure to</a>
<a id='line_4281'>obtain his boon.</a>
<a id='line_4282'></a>
<a id='line_4283'>Then said Arthur, “Oh! chieftain, I have never heard of the maiden of</a>
<a id='line_4284'>whom thou speakest, nor of her kindred, but I will gladly send messengers</a>
<a id='line_4285'>in search of her.  Give me time to seek her.”  And the youth said, “I</a>
<a id='line_4286'>will willingly grant from this night to that at the end of the year to do</a>
<a id='line_4287'>so.”  Then Arthur sent messengers to every land within his dominions to</a>
<a id='line_4288'>seek for the maiden; and at the end of the year Arthur’s messengers</a>
<a id='line_4289'>returned without having gained any knowledge or intelligence concerning</a>
<a id='line_4290'>Olwen more than on the first day.  Then said Kilhwch, “Every one has</a>
<a id='line_4291'>received his boon, and I yet lack mine.  I will depart and bear away thy</a>
<a id='line_4292'>honour with me.”  Then said Kai, “Rash chieftain! dost thou reproach</a>
<a id='line_4293'>Arthur?  Go with us, and we will not part until thou dost either confess</a>
<a id='line_4294'>that the maiden exists not in the world, or until we obtain her.”</a>
<a id='line_4295'>Thereupon Kai rose up.  Kai had this peculiarity, that his breath lasted</a>
<a id='line_4296'>nine nights and nine days under water, and he could exist nine nights and</a>
<a id='line_4297'>nine days without sleep.  A wound from Kai’s sword no physician could</a>
<a id='line_4298'>heal.  Very subtle was Kai.  When it pleased him he could render himself</a>
<a id='line_4299'>as tall as the highest tree in the forest.  And he had another</a>
<a id='line_4300'>peculiarity,—so great was the heat of his nature, that, when it rained</a>
<a id='line_4301'>hardest, whatever he carried remained dry for a handbreadth above and a</a>
<a id='line_4302'>handbreadth below his hand; and when his companions were coldest, it was</a>
<a id='line_4303'>to them as fuel with which to light their fire.</a>
<a id='line_4304'></a>
<a id='line_4305'>And Arthur called Bedwyr, who never shrank from any enterprise upon which</a>
<a id='line_4306'>Kai was bound.  None was equal to him in swiftness throughout this island</a>
<a id='line_4307'>except Arthur and Drych Ail Kibddar.  And although he was one-handed,</a>
<a id='line_4308'>three warriors could not shed blood faster than he on the field of</a>
<a id='line_4309'>battle.  Another property he had; his lance would produce a wound equal</a>
<a id='line_4310'>to those of nine opposing lances.</a>
<a id='line_4311'></a>
<a id='line_4312'>And Arthur called to Kynddelig the Guide, “Go thou upon this expedition</a>
<a id='line_4313'>with the chieftain.”  For as good a guide was he in a land which he had</a>
<a id='line_4314'>never seen as he was in his own.</a>
<a id='line_4315'></a>
<a id='line_4316'>He called Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd, because he knew all tongues.</a>
<a id='line_4317'></a>
<a id='line_4318'>He called Gwalchmai the son of Gwyar, because he never returned home</a>
<a id='line_4319'>without achieving the adventure of which he went in quest.  He was the</a>
<a id='line_4320'>best of footmen and the best of knights.  He was nephew to Arthur, the</a>
<a id='line_4321'>son of his sister, and his cousin.</a>
<a id='line_4322'></a>
<a id='line_4323'>And Arthur called Menw the son of Teirgwaedd, in order that if they went</a>
<a id='line_4324'>into a savage country, he might cast a charm and an illusion over them,</a>
<a id='line_4325'>so that none might see them whilst they could see every one.</a>
<a id='line_4326'></a>
<a id='line_4327'>They journeyed until they came to a vast open plain, wherein they saw a</a>
<a id='line_4328'>great castle, which was the fairest of the castles of the world.  And</a>
<a id='line_4329'>they journeyed that day until the evening, and when they thought they</a>
<a id='line_4330'>were nigh to the castle, they were no nearer to it than they had been in</a>
<a id='line_4331'>the morning.  And the second and the third day they journeyed, and even</a>
<a id='line_4332'>then scarcely could they reach so far.  And when they came before the</a>
<a id='line_4333'>castle, they beheld a vast flock of sheep, which was boundless and</a>
<a id='line_4334'>without an end.  And upon the top of a mound there was a herdsman,</a>
<a id='line_4335'>keeping the sheep.  And a rug made of skins was upon him; and by his side</a>
<a id='line_4336'>was a shaggy mastiff, larger than a steed nine winters old.  Never had he</a>
<a id='line_4337'>lost even a lamb from his flock, much less a large sheep.  He let no</a>
<a id='line_4338'>occasion ever pass without doing some hurt and harm.  All the dead trees</a>
<a id='line_4339'>and bushes in the plain he burnt with his breath down to the very ground.</a>
<a id='line_4340'></a>
<a id='line_4341'>Then said Kai, “Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd, go thou and salute yonder</a>
<a id='line_4342'>man.”  “Kai,” said he, “I engaged not to go further than thou thyself.”</a>
<a id='line_4343'>“Let us go then together,” answered Kai.  Said Menw the son of</a>
<a id='line_4344'>Teirgwaedd, “Fear not to go thither, for I will cast a spell upon the</a>
<a id='line_4345'>dog, so that he shall injure no one.”  And they went up to the mound</a>
<a id='line_4346'>whereon the herdsman was, and they said to him, “How dost thou fare, O</a>
<a id='line_4347'>herdsman?”  “No less fair be it to you than to me.”  “Truly, art thou the</a>
<a id='line_4348'>chief?”  “There is no hurt to injure me but my own.” {5}  “Whose are the</a>
<a id='line_4349'>sheep that thou dost keep, and to whom does yonder castle belong?”</a>
<a id='line_4350'>“Stupid are ye, truly!  Through the whole world is it known that this is</a>
<a id='line_4351'>the castle of Yspaddaden Penkawr.”  “And who art thou?”  “I am called</a>
<a id='line_4352'>Custennin the son of Dyfnedig, and my brother Yspaddaden Penkawr</a>
<a id='line_4353'>oppressed me because of my possessions.  And ye also, who are ye?”  “We</a>
<a id='line_4354'>are an embassy from Arthur, come to seek Olwen the daughter of Yspaddaden</a>
<a id='line_4355'>Penkawr.”  “Oh men! the mercy of Heaven be upon you, do not that for all</a>
<a id='line_4356'>the world.  None who ever came hither on this quest has returned alive.”</a>
<a id='line_4357'>And the herdsman rose up.  And as he arose, Kilhwch gave unto him a ring</a>
<a id='line_4358'>of gold.  And he sought to put on the ring, but it was too small for him,</a>
<a id='line_4359'>so he placed it in the finger of his glove.  And he went home, and gave</a>
<a id='line_4360'>the glove to his spouse to keep.  And she took the ring from the glove</a>
<a id='line_4361'>when it was given her, and she said, “Whence came this ring, for thou art</a>
<a id='line_4362'>not wont to have good fortune?”  “I went,” said he, “to the sea to seek</a>
<a id='line_4363'>for fish, and lo, I saw a corpse borne by the waves.  And a fairer corpse</a>
<a id='line_4364'>than it did I never behold.  And from its finger did I take this ring.”</a>
<a id='line_4365'>“O man! does the sea permit its dead to wear jewels?  Show me then this</a>
<a id='line_4366'>body.”  “Oh wife, him to whom this ring belonged thou shalt see here in</a>
<a id='line_4367'>the evening.”  “And who is he?” asked the woman, “Kilhwch the son of</a>
<a id='line_4368'>Kilydd, the son of Prince Kelyddon, by Goleuddydd the daughter of Prince</a>
<a id='line_4369'>Anlawdd, his mother, who is come to seek Olwen as his wife.”  And when</a>
<a id='line_4370'>she heard that, her feelings were divided between the joy that she had</a>
<a id='line_4371'>that her nephew, the son of her sister, was coming to her, and sorrow</a>
<a id='line_4372'>because she had never known any one depart alive who had come on that</a>
<a id='line_4373'>quest.</a>
<a id='line_4374'></a>
<a id='line_4375'>And they went forward to the gate of Custennin the herdsman’s dwelling.</a>
<a id='line_4376'>And when she heard their footsteps approaching, she ran out with joy to</a>
<a id='line_4377'>meet them.  And Kai snatched a billet out of the pile.  And when she met</a>
<a id='line_4378'>them she sought to throw her arms about their necks.  And Kai placed the</a>
<a id='line_4379'>log between her two hands, and she squeezed it so that it became a</a>
<a id='line_4380'>twisted coil.  “Oh woman,” said Kai, “if thou hadst squeezed me thus,</a>
<a id='line_4381'>none could ever again have set their affections on me.  Evil love were</a>
<a id='line_4382'>this.”  They entered into the house, and were served; and soon after they</a>
<a id='line_4383'>all went forth to amuse themselves.  Then the woman opened a stone chest</a>
<a id='line_4384'>that was before the chimney-corner, and out of it arose a youth with</a>
<a id='line_4385'>yellow curling hair.  Said Gwrhyr, “It is a pity to hide this youth.  I</a>
<a id='line_4386'>know that it is not his own crime that is thus visited upon him.”  “This</a>
<a id='line_4387'>is but a remnant,” said the woman.  “Three-and-twenty of my sons has</a>
<a id='line_4388'>Yspaddaden Penkawr slain, and I have no more hope of this one than of the</a>
<a id='line_4389'>others.”  Then said Kai, “Let him come and be a companion with me, and he</a>
<a id='line_4390'>shall not be slain unless I also am slain with him.”  And they ate.  And</a>
<a id='line_4391'>the woman asked them, “Upon what errand come you here?”  “We come to seek</a>
<a id='line_4392'>Olwen for this youth.”  Then said the woman, “In the name of Heaven,</a>
<a id='line_4393'>since no one from the castle hath yet seen you, return again whence you</a>
<a id='line_4394'>came.”  “Heaven is our witness, that we will not return until we have</a>
<a id='line_4395'>seen the maiden.”  Said Kai, “Does she ever come hither, so that she may</a>
<a id='line_4396'>be seen?”  “She comes here every Saturday to wash her head, and in the</a>
<a id='line_4397'>vessel where she washes, she leaves all her rings, and she never either</a>
<a id='line_4398'>comes herself or sends any messengers to fetch them.”</a>
<a id='line_4399'></a>
<a id='line_4400'>“Will she come here if she is sent to?”  “Heaven knows that I will not</a>
<a id='line_4401'>destroy my soul, nor will I betray those that trust me; unless you will</a>
<a id='line_4402'>pledge me your faith that you will not harm her, I will not send to her.”</a>
<a id='line_4403'>“We pledge it,” said they.  So a message was sent, and she came.</a>
<a id='line_4404'></a>
<a id='line_4405'>The maiden was clothed in a robe of flame-coloured silk, and about her</a>
<a id='line_4406'>neck was a collar of ruddy gold, on which were precious emeralds and</a>
<a id='line_4407'>rubies.  More yellow was her head than the flower of the broom, and her</a>
<a id='line_4408'>skin was whiter than the foam of the wave, and fairer were her hands and</a>
<a id='line_4409'>her fingers than the blossoms of the wood anemone amidst the spray of the</a>
<a id='line_4410'>meadow fountain.  The eye of the trained hawk, the glance of the</a>
<a id='line_4411'>three-mewed falcon was not brighter than hers.  Her bosom was more snowy</a>
<a id='line_4412'>than the breast of the white swan, her cheek was redder than the reddest</a>
<a id='line_4413'>roses.  Whoso beheld her was filled with her love.  Four white trefoils</a>
<a id='line_4414'>sprung up wherever she trod.  And therefore was she called Olwen.</a>
<a id='line_4415'></a>
<a id='line_4416'>She entered the house, and sat beside Kilhwch upon the foremost bench;</a>
<a id='line_4417'>and as soon as he saw her he knew her.  And Kilhwch said unto her, “Ah!</a>
<a id='line_4418'>maiden, thou art she whom I have loved; come away with me, lest they</a>
<a id='line_4419'>speak evil of thee and of me.  Many a day have I loved thee.”  “I cannot</a>
<a id='line_4420'>do this, for I have pledged my faith to my father not to go without his</a>
<a id='line_4421'>counsel, for his life will last only until the time of my espousals.</a>
<a id='line_4422'>Whatever is, must be.  But I will give thee advice if thou wilt take it.</a>
<a id='line_4423'>Go, ask me of my father, and that which he shall require of thee, grant</a>
<a id='line_4424'>it, and thou wilt obtain me; but if thou deny him anything, thou wilt not</a>
<a id='line_4425'>obtain me, and it will be well for thee if thou escape with thy life.”</a>
<a id='line_4426'>“I promise all this, if occasion offer,” said he.</a>
<a id='line_4427'></a>
<a id='line_4428'>She returned to her chamber, and they all rose up and followed her to the</a>
<a id='line_4429'>castle.  And they slew the nine porters that were at the nine gates in</a>
<a id='line_4430'>silence.  And they slew the nine watch-dogs without one of them barking.</a>
<a id='line_4431'>And they went forward to the hall.</a>
<a id='line_4432'></a>
<a id='line_4433'>“The greeting of Heaven and of man be unto thee, Yspaddaden Penkawr,”</a>
<a id='line_4434'>said they.  “And you, wherefore come you?”  “We come to ask thy daughter</a>
<a id='line_4435'>Olwen, for Kilhwch the son of Kilydd, the son of Prince Kelyddon.”</a>
<a id='line_4436'>“Where are my pages and my servants?  Raise up the forks beneath my two</a>
<a id='line_4437'>eyebrows which have fallen over my eyes, that I may see the fashion of my</a>
<a id='line_4438'>son-in-law.”  And they did so.  “Come hither to-morrow, and you shall</a>
<a id='line_4439'>have an answer.”</a>
<a id='line_4440'></a>
<a id='line_4441'>They rose to go forth, and Yspaddaden Penkawr seized one of the three</a>
<a id='line_4442'>poisoned darts that lay beside him, and threw it after them.  And Bedwyr</a>
<a id='line_4443'>caught it, and flung it, and pierced Yspaddaden Penkawr grievously with</a>
<a id='line_4444'>it through the knee.  Then he said, “A cursed ungentle son-in-law, truly.</a>
<a id='line_4445'>I shall ever walk the worse for his rudeness, and shall ever be without a</a>
<a id='line_4446'>cure.  This poisoned iron pains me like the bite of a gadfly.  Cursed be</a>
<a id='line_4447'>the smith who forged it, and the anvil whereon it was wrought!  So sharp</a>
<a id='line_4448'>is it!”</a>
<a id='line_4449'></a>
<a id='line_4450'>That night also they took up their abode in the house of Custennin the</a>
<a id='line_4451'>herdsman.  The next day with the dawn they arrayed themselves in haste</a>
<a id='line_4452'>and proceeded to the castle, and entered the hall, and they said,</a>
<a id='line_4453'>“Yspaddaden Penkawr, give us thy daughter in consideration of her dower</a>
<a id='line_4454'>and her maiden fee, which we will pay to thee and to her two kinswomen</a>
<a id='line_4455'>likewise.  And unless thou wilt do so, thou shalt meet with thy death on</a>
<a id='line_4456'>her account.”  Then he said, “Her four great-grandmothers, and her four</a>
<a id='line_4457'>great-grandsires are yet alive, it is needful that I take counsel of</a>
<a id='line_4458'>them.”  “Be it so,” answered they, “we will go to meat.”  As they rose</a>
<a id='line_4459'>up, he took the second dart that was beside him, and cast it after them.</a>
<a id='line_4460'>And Menw the son of Gwaedd caught it, and flung it back at him, and</a>
<a id='line_4461'>wounded him in the centre of the breast, so that it came out at the small</a>
<a id='line_4462'>of his back.  “A cursed ungentle son-in-law, truly,” said he, “the hard</a>
<a id='line_4463'>iron pains me like the bite of a horse-leech.  Cursed be the hearth</a>
<a id='line_4464'>whereon it was heated, and the smith who formed it!  So sharp is it!</a>
<a id='line_4465'>Henceforth, whenever I go up a hill, I shall have a scant in my breath,</a>
<a id='line_4466'>and a pain in my chest, and I shall often loathe my food.”  And they went</a>
<a id='line_4467'>to meat.</a>
<a id='line_4468'></a>
<a id='line_4469'>And the third day they returned to the palace.  And Yspaddaden Penkawr</a>
<a id='line_4470'>said to them, “Shoot not at me again unless you desire death.  Where are</a>
<a id='line_4471'>my attendants?  Lift up the forks of my eyebrows which have fallen over</a>
<a id='line_4472'>my eyeballs, that I may see the fashion of my son-in-law.”  Then they</a>
<a id='line_4473'>arose, and, as they did so, Yspaddaden Penkawr took the third poisoned</a>
<a id='line_4474'>dart and cast it at them.  And Kilhwch caught it and threw it vigorously,</a>
<a id='line_4475'>and wounded him through the eyeball, so that the dart came out at the</a>
<a id='line_4476'>back of his head.  “A cursed ungentle son-in-law, truly!  As long as I</a>
<a id='line_4477'>remain alive, my eyesight will be the worse.  Whenever I go against the</a>
<a id='line_4478'>wind, my eyes will water; and peradventure my head will burn, and I shall</a>
<a id='line_4479'>have a giddiness every new moon.  Cursed be the fire in which it was</a>
<a id='line_4480'>forged.  Like the bite of a mad dog is the stroke of this poisoned iron.”</a>
<a id='line_4481'>And they went to meat.</a>
<a id='line_4482'></a>
<a id='line_4483'>And the next day they came again to the palace, and they said, “Shoot not</a>
<a id='line_4484'>at us any more, unless thou desirest such hurt, and harm, and torture as</a>
<a id='line_4485'>thou now hast, and even more.”  “Give me thy daughter, and if thou wilt</a>
<a id='line_4486'>not give her, thou shalt receive thy death because of her.”  “Where is he</a>
<a id='line_4487'>that seeks my daughter?  Come hither where I may see thee.”  And they</a>
<a id='line_4488'>placed him a chair face to face with him.</a>
<a id='line_4489'></a>
<a id='line_4490'>Said Yspaddaden Penkawr, “Is it thou that seekest my daughter?”  “It is</a>
<a id='line_4491'>I,” answered Kilhwch.  “I must have thy pledge that thou wilt not do</a>
<a id='line_4492'>towards me otherwise than is just, and when I have gotten that which I</a>
<a id='line_4493'>shall name, my daughter thou shalt have.”  “I promise thee that</a>
<a id='line_4494'>willingly,” said Kilhwch, “name what thou wilt.”  “I will do so,” said</a>
<a id='line_4495'>he.</a>
<a id='line_4496'></a>
<a id='line_4497'>“Seest thou yonder vast hill?”  “I see it.”  “I require that it be rooted</a>
<a id='line_4498'>up, and that the grubbings be burned for manure on the face of the land,</a>
<a id='line_4499'>and that it be ploughed and sown in one day, and in one day that the</a>
<a id='line_4500'>grain ripen.  And of that wheat I intend to make food and liquor fit for</a>
<a id='line_4501'>the wedding of thee and my daughter.  And all this I require done in one</a>
<a id='line_4502'>day.”</a>
<a id='line_4503'></a>
<a id='line_4504'>“It will be easy for me to compass this, although thou mayest think that</a>
<a id='line_4505'>it will not be easy.”</a>
<a id='line_4506'></a>
<a id='line_4507'>“Though this be easy for thee, there is yet that which will not be so.</a>
<a id='line_4508'>No husbandman can till or prepare this land, so wild is it, except</a>

<a id='line_4511'></a>
<a id='line_4512'>“It will be easy for me to compass this, although thou mayest think that</a>

<a id='line_4825'>All that day they journeyed until the evening, and then they beheld a</a>
<a id='line_4826'>vast castle, which was the largest in the world.  And lo, a black man,</a>
<a id='line_4827'>huger than three of the men of this world, came out from the castle.  And</a>
<a id='line_4828'>they spoke unto him, “Whence comest thou, O man?”  “From the castle which</a>
<a id='line_4829'>you see yonder.”  “Whose castle is that?” asked they.  “Stupid are ye</a>
<a id='line_4830'>truly, O men.  There is no one in the world that does not know to whom</a>
<a id='line_4831'>this castle belongs.  It is the castle of Gwrnach the Giant.”  “What</a>
<a id='line_4832'>treatment is there for guests and strangers that alight in that castle?”</a>
<a id='line_4833'>“Oh!  Chieftain, Heaven protect thee.  No guest ever returned thence</a>
<a id='line_4834'>alive, and no one may enter therein unless he brings with him his craft.”</a>
<a id='line_4835'></a>
<a id='line_4836'>Then they proceeded towards the gate.  Said Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd,</a>
<a id='line_4837'>“Is there a porter?”  “There is.  And thou, if thy tongue be not mute in</a>
<a id='line_4838'>thy head, wherefore dost thou call?”  “Open the gate.”  “I will not open</a>
<a id='line_4839'>it.”  “Wherefore wilt thou not?”  “The knife is in the meat, and the</a>
<a id='line_4840'>drink is in the horn, and there is revelry in the hall of Gwrnach the</a>
<a id='line_4841'>Giant, and except for a craftsman who brings his craft, the gate will not</a>
<a id='line_4842'>be opened to-night.”  “Verily, porter,” then said Kai, “my craft bring I</a>
<a id='line_4843'>with me.”  “What is thy craft?”  “The best burnisher of swords am I in</a>
<a id='line_4844'>the world.”  “I will go and tell this unto Gwrnach the Giant, and I will</a>
<a id='line_4845'>bring thee an answer.”</a>
<a id='line_4846'></a>
<a id='line_4847'>So the porter went in, and Gwrnach said to him, “Hast thou any news from</a>
<a id='line_4848'>the gate?”  “I have.  There is a party at the door of the gate who desire</a>
<a id='line_4849'>to come in.”  “Didst thou inquire of them if they possessed any art?”  “I</a>
<a id='line_4850'>did inquire,” said he, “and one told me that he was well skilled in the</a>
<a id='line_4851'>burnishing of swords.”  “We have need of him then.  For some time have I</a>
<a id='line_4852'>sought for some one to polish my sword, and could find no one.  Let this</a>
<a id='line_4853'>man enter, since he brings with him his craft.”  The porter thereupon</a>
<a id='line_4854'>returned and opened the gate.  And Kai went in by himself, and he saluted</a>
<a id='line_4855'>Gwrnach the Giant.  And a chair was placed for him opposite to Gwrnach.</a>
<a id='line_4856'>And Gwrnach said to him, “Oh man! is it true that is reported of thee,</a>
<a id='line_4857'>that thou knowest how to burnish swords?”  “I know full well how to do</a>
<a id='line_4858'>so,” answered Kai.  Then was the sword of Gwrnach brought to him.  And</a>
<a id='line_4859'>Kai took a blue whetstone from under his arm, and asked him whether he</a>
<a id='line_4860'>would have it burnished white or blue.  “Do with it as it seems good to</a>
<a id='line_4861'>thee, and as thou wouldest if it were thine own.”  Then Kai polished one</a>
<a id='line_4862'>half of the blade and put it in his hand.  “Will this please thee?” asked</a>
<a id='line_4863'>he.  “I would rather than all that is in my dominions that the whole of</a>
<a id='line_4864'>it were like unto this.  It is a marvel to me that such a man as thou</a>
<a id='line_4865'>should be without a companion.”  “Oh! noble sir, I have a companion,</a>
<a id='line_4866'>albeit he is not skilled in this art.”  “Who may he be?”  “Let the porter</a>
<a id='line_4867'>go forth, and I will tell him whereby he may know him.  The head of his</a>
<a id='line_4868'>lance will leave its shaft, and draw blood from the wind, and will</a>
<a id='line_4869'>descend upon its shaft again.”  Then the gate was opened, and Bedwyr</a>
<a id='line_4870'>entered.  And Kai said, “Bedwyr is very skilful, although he knows not</a>
<a id='line_4871'>this art.”</a>
<a id='line_4872'></a>
<a id='line_4873'>And there was much discourse among those who were without, because that</a>
<a id='line_4874'>Kai and Bedwyr had gone in.  And a young man who was with them, the only</a>
<a id='line_4875'>son of Custennin the herdsman, got in also.  And he caused all his</a>
<a id='line_4876'>companions to keep close to him as he passed the three wards, and until</a>
<a id='line_4877'>he came into the midst of the castle.  And his companions said unto the</a>
<a id='line_4878'>son of Custennin, “Thou hast done this!  Thou art the best of all men.”</a>
<a id='line_4879'>And thenceforth he was called Goreu, the son of Custennin.  Then they</a>
<a id='line_4880'>dispersed to their lodgings, that they might slay those who lodged</a>
<a id='line_4881'>therein, unknown to the Giant.</a>
<a id='line_4882'></a>
<a id='line_4883'>The sword was now polished, and Kai gave it unto the hand of Gwrnach the</a>
<a id='line_4884'>Giant, to see if he were pleased with his work.  And the Giant said, “The</a>
<a id='line_4885'>work is good, I am content therewith.”  Said Kai, “It is thy scabbard</a>
<a id='line_4886'>that hath rusted thy sword, give it to me that I may take out the wooden</a>
<a id='line_4887'>sides of it and put in new ones.”  And he took the scabbard from him, and</a>
<a id='line_4888'>the sword in the other hand.  And he came and stood over against the</a>
<a id='line_4889'>Giant, as if he would have put the sword into the scabbard; and with it</a>
<a id='line_4890'>he struck at the head of the Giant, and cut off his head at one blow.</a>
<a id='line_4891'>Then they despoiled the castle, and took from it what goods and jewels</a>
<a id='line_4892'>they would.  And again on the same day, at the beginning of the year,</a>
<a id='line_4893'>they came to Arthur’s Court, bearing with them the sword of Gwrnach the</a>
<a id='line_4894'>Giant.</a>
<a id='line_4895'></a>
<a id='line_4896'>Now, when they told Arthur how they had sped, Arthur said, “Which of</a>
<a id='line_4897'>these marvels will it be best for us to seek first?”  “It will be best,”</a>
<a id='line_4898'>said they, “to seek Mabon the son of Modron; and he will not be found</a>
<a id='line_4899'>unless we first find Eidoel the son of Aer, his kinsman.”  Then Arthur</a>
<a id='line_4900'>rose up, and the warriors of the Islands of Britain with him, to seek for</a>
<a id='line_4901'>Eidoel; and they proceeded until they came before the Castle of Glivi,</a>
<a id='line_4902'>where Eidoel was imprisoned.  Glivi stood on the summit of his castle,</a>
<a id='line_4903'>and he said, “Arthur, what requirest thou of me, since nothing remains to</a>
<a id='line_4904'>me in this fortress, and I have neither joy nor pleasure in it; neither</a>
<a id='line_4905'>wheat nor oats?  Seek not therefore to do me harm.”  Said Arthur, “Not to</a>
<a id='line_4906'>injure thee came I hither, but to seek for the prisoner that is with</a>
<a id='line_4907'>thee.”  “I will give thee my prisoner, though I had not thought to give</a>
<a id='line_4908'>him up to any one; and therewith shalt thou have my support and my aid.”</a>
<a id='line_4909'></a>
<a id='line_4910'>His followers said unto Arthur, “Lord, go thou home, thou canst not</a>
<a id='line_4911'>proceed with thy host in quest of such small adventures as these.”  Then</a>
<a id='line_4912'>said Arthur, “It were well for thee, Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd, to go</a>
<a id='line_4913'>upon this quest, for thou knowest all languages, and art familiar with</a>
<a id='line_4914'>those of the birds and the beasts.  Thou, Eidoel, oughtest likewise to go</a>
<a id='line_4915'>with my men in search of thy cousin.  And as for you, Kai and Bedwyr, I</a>
<a id='line_4916'>have hope of whatever adventure ye are in quest of, that ye will achieve</a>
<a id='line_4917'>it.  Achieve ye this adventure for me.”</a>
<a id='line_4918'></a>
<a id='line_4919'>They went forward until they came to the Ousel of Cilgwri.  And Gwrhyr</a>
<a id='line_4920'>adjured her for the sake of Heaven, saying, “Tell me if thou knowest</a>
<a id='line_4921'>aught of Mabon the son of Modron, who was taken when three nights old</a>
<a id='line_4922'>from between his mother and the wall.”  And the Ousel answered, “When I</a>
<a id='line_4923'>first came here, there was a smith’s anvil in this place, and I was then</a>
<a id='line_4924'>a young bird; and from that time no work has been done upon it, save the</a>
<a id='line_4925'>pecking of my beak every evening, and now there is not so much as the</a>
<a id='line_4926'>size of a nut remaining thereof; yet the vengeance of Heaven be upon me,</a>
<a id='line_4927'>if during all that time I have ever heard of the man for whom you</a>
<a id='line_4928'>inquire.  Nevertheless I will do that which is right, and that which it</a>
<a id='line_4929'>is fitting that I should do for an embassy from Arthur.  There is a race</a>
<a id='line_4930'>of animals who were formed before me, and I will be your guide to them.”</a>
<a id='line_4931'></a>
<a id='line_4932'>So they proceeded to the place where was the Stag of Redynvre.  “Stag of</a>
<a id='line_4933'>Redynvre, behold we are come to thee, an embassy from Arthur, for we have</a>
<a id='line_4934'>not heard of any animal older than thou.  Say, knowest thou aught of</a>
<a id='line_4935'>Mabon the son of Modron, who was taken from his mother when three nights</a>
<a id='line_4936'>old?”  The Stag said, “When first I came hither, there was a plain all</a>
<a id='line_4937'>around me, without any trees save one oak sapling, which grew up to be an</a>
<a id='line_4938'>oak with an hundred branches.  And that oak has since perished, so that</a>
<a id='line_4939'>now nothing remains of it but the withered stump; and from that day to</a>
<a id='line_4940'>this I have been here, yet have I never heard of the man for whom you</a>
<a id='line_4941'>inquire.  Nevertheless, being an embassy from Arthur, I will be your</a>
<a id='line_4942'>guide to the place where there is an animal which was formed before I</a>
<a id='line_4943'>was.”</a>
<a id='line_4944'></a>
<a id='line_4945'>So they proceeded to the place where was the Owl of Cwm Cawlwyd.  “Owl of</a>
<a id='line_4946'>Cwm Cawlwyd, here is an embassy from Arthur; knowest thou aught of Mabon</a>
<a id='line_4947'>the son of Modron, who was taken after three nights from his mother?”</a>
<a id='line_4948'>“If I knew I would tell you.  When first I came hither, the wide valley</a>
<a id='line_4949'>you see was a wooded glen.  And a race of men came and rooted it up.  And</a>
<a id='line_4950'>there grew there a second wood; and this wood is the third.  My wings,</a>
<a id='line_4951'>are they not withered stumps?  Yet all this time, even until to-day, I</a>
<a id='line_4952'>have never heard of the man for whom you inquire.  Nevertheless, I will</a>
<a id='line_4953'>be the guide of Arthur’s embassy until you come to the place where is the</a>
<a id='line_4954'>oldest animal in this world, and the one that has travelled most, the</a>
<a id='line_4955'>Eagle of Gwern Abwy.”</a>
<a id='line_4956'></a>
<a id='line_4957'>Gwrhyr said, “Eagle of Gwern Abwy, we have come to thee an embassy from</a>
<a id='line_4958'>Arthur, to ask thee if thou knowest aught of Mabon the son of Modron, who</a>
<a id='line_4959'>was taken from his mother when he was three nights old.”  The Eagle said,</a>
<a id='line_4960'>“I have been here for a great space of time, and when I first came hither</a>
<a id='line_4961'>there was a rock here, from the top of which I pecked at the stars every</a>
<a id='line_4962'>evening; and now it is not so much as a span high.  From that day to this</a>
<a id='line_4963'>I have been here, and I have never heard of the man for whom you inquire,</a>
<a id='line_4964'>except once when I went in search of food as far as Llyn Llyw.  And when</a>
<a id='line_4965'>I came there, I struck my talons into a salmon, thinking he would serve</a>
<a id='line_4966'>me as food for a long time.  But he drew me into the deep, and I was</a>
<a id='line_4967'>scarcely able to escape from him.  After that I went with my whole</a>
<a id='line_4968'>kindred to attack him, and to try to destroy him, but he sent messengers,</a>
<a id='line_4969'>and made peace with me; and came and besought me to take fifty fish</a>
<a id='line_4970'>spears out of his back.  Unless he know something of him whom you seek, I</a>
<a id='line_4971'>cannot tell who may.  However, I will guide you to the place where he</a>
<a id='line_4972'>is.”</a>
<a id='line_4973'></a>
<a id='line_4974'>So they went thither; and the Eagle said, “Salmon of Llyn Llyw, I have</a>
<a id='line_4975'>come to thee with an embassy from Arthur, to ask thee if thou knowest</a>
<a id='line_4976'>aught concerning Mabon the son of Modron, who was taken away at three</a>
<a id='line_4977'>nights old from his mother.”  “As much as I know I will tell thee.  With</a>
<a id='line_4978'>every tide I go along the river upwards, until I come near to the walls</a>
<a id='line_4979'>of Gloucester, and there have I found such wrong as I never found</a>
<a id='line_4980'>elsewhere; and to the end that ye may give credence thereto, let one of</a>
<a id='line_4981'>you go thither upon each of my two shoulders.”  So Kai and Gwrhyr</a>
<a id='line_4982'>Gwalstawt Ieithoedd went upon the two shoulders of the salmon, and they</a>
<a id='line_4983'>proceeded until they came unto the wall of the prison, and they heard a</a>
<a id='line_4984'>great wailing and lamenting from the dungeon.  Said Gwrhyr, “Who is it</a>
<a id='line_4985'>that laments in this house of stone?”  “Alas, there is reason enough for</a>
<a id='line_4986'>whoever is here to lament.  It is Mabon the son of Modron who is here</a>
<a id='line_4987'>imprisoned; and no imprisonment was ever so grievous as mine, neither</a>
<a id='line_4988'>that of Llud Llaw Ereint, nor that of Greid the son of Eri.”  “Hast thou</a>
<a id='line_4989'>hope of being released for gold or for silver, or for any gifts of</a>
<a id='line_4990'>wealth, or through battle and fighting?”  “By fighting will whatever I</a>
<a id='line_4991'>may gain be obtained.”</a>
<a id='line_4992'></a>
<a id='line_4993'>Then they went thence, and returned to Arthur, and they told him where</a>
<a id='line_4994'>Mabon the son of Modron was imprisoned.  And Arthur summoned the warriors</a>
<a id='line_4995'>of the Island, and they journeyed as far as Gloucester, to the place</a>
<a id='line_4996'>where Mabon was in prison.  Kai and Bedwyr went upon the shoulders of the</a>
<a id='line_4997'>fish, whilst the warriors of Arthur attacked the castle.  And Kai broke</a>
<a id='line_4998'>through the wall into the dungeon, and brought away the prisoner upon his</a>
<a id='line_4999'>back, whilst the fight was going on between the warriors.  And Arthur</a>
<a id='line_5000'>returned home, and Mabon with him at liberty.</a>
<a id='line_5001'></a>
<a id='line_5002'>                                * * * * *</a>
<a id='line_5003'></a>
<a id='line_5004'>Said Arthur, “Which of the marvels will it be best for us now to seek</a>
<a id='line_5005'>first?”  “It will be best to seek for the two cubs of Gast Rhymhi.”  “Is</a>
<a id='line_5006'>it known,” asked Arthur, “where she is?”  “She is in Aber Deu Cleddyf,”</a>
<a id='line_5007'>said one.  Then Arthur went to the house of Tringad, in Aber Cleddyf, and</a>
<a id='line_5008'>he inquired of him whether he had heard of her there.  “In what form may</a>
<a id='line_5009'>she be?”  “She is in the form of a she-wolf,” said he; “and with her</a>
<a id='line_5010'>there are two cubs.”  “She has often slain my herds, and she is there</a>
<a id='line_5011'>below in a cave in Aber Cleddyf.”</a>
<a id='line_5012'></a>
<a id='line_5013'>So Arthur went in his ship Prydwen by sea, and the others went by land,</a>
<a id='line_5014'>to hunt her.  And they surrounded her and her two cubs, and God did</a>
<a id='line_5015'>change them again for Arthur into their own form.  And the host of Arthur</a>
<a id='line_5016'>dispersed themselves into parties of one and two.</a>
<a id='line_5017'></a>
<a id='line_5018'>                                * * * * *</a>
<a id='line_5019'></a>
<a id='line_5020'>On a certain day, as Gwythyr the son of Greidawl was walking over a</a>
<a id='line_5021'>mountain, he heard a wailing and a grievous cry.  And when he heard it,</a>
<a id='line_5022'>he sprang forward, and went towards it.  And when he came there, he drew</a>
<a id='line_5023'>his sword, and smote off an ant-hill close to the earth, whereby it</a>
<a id='line_5024'>escaped being burned in the fire.  And the ants said to him, “Receive</a>
<a id='line_5025'>from us the blessing of Heaven, and that which no man can give we will</a>
<a id='line_5026'>give thee.”  Then they fetched the nine bushels of flax-seed which</a>
<a id='line_5027'>Yspaddaden Penkawr had required of Kilhwch, and they brought the full</a>
<a id='line_5028'>measure without lacking any, except one flax-seed, and that the lame</a>
<a id='line_5029'>pismire brought in before night.</a>
<a id='line_5030'></a>
<a id='line_5031'>                                * * * * *</a>
<a id='line_5032'></a>
<a id='line_5033'>As Kai and Bedwyr sat on a beacon carn on the summit of Plinlimmon, in</a>
<a id='line_5034'>the highest wind that ever was in the world, they looked around them, and</a>
<a id='line_5035'>saw a great smoke towards the south, afar off, which did not bend with</a>
<a id='line_5036'>the wind.  Then said Kai, “By the hand of my friend, behold, yonder is</a>
<a id='line_5037'>the fire of a robber!”  Then they hastened towards the smoke, and they</a>
<a id='line_5038'>came so near to it, that they could see Dillus Varvawc scorching a wild</a>
<a id='line_5039'>boar.  “Behold, yonder is the greatest robber that ever fled from</a>
<a id='line_5040'>Arthur,” said Bedwyr unto Kai.  “Dost thou know him?”  “I do know him,”</a>
<a id='line_5041'>answered Kai, “he is Dillus Varvawc, and no leash in the world will be</a>
<a id='line_5042'>able to hold Drudwyn, the cub of Greid the son of Eri, save a leash made</a>
<a id='line_5043'>from the beard of him thou seest yonder.  And even that will be useless,</a>
<a id='line_5044'>unless his beard be plucked alive with wooden tweezers; for if dead, it</a>
<a id='line_5045'>will be brittle.”  “What thinkest thou that we should do concerning</a>
<a id='line_5046'>this?” said Bedwyr.  “Let us suffer him,” said Kai, “to eat as much as he</a>
<a id='line_5047'>will of the meat, and after that he will fall asleep.”  And during that</a>
<a id='line_5048'>time they employed themselves in making the wooden tweezers.  And when</a>
<a id='line_5049'>Kai knew certainly that he was asleep, he made a pit under his feet, the</a>
<a id='line_5050'>largest in the world, and he struck him a violent blow, and squeezed him</a>
<a id='line_5051'>into the pit.  And there they twitched out his beard completely with the</a>
<a id='line_5052'>wooden tweezers; and after that they slew him altogether.</a>
<a id='line_5053'></a>
<a id='line_5054'>And from thence they both went to Gelli Wic, in Cornwall, and took the</a>
<a id='line_5055'>leash made of Dillus Varvawc’s beard with them, and they gave it into</a>
<a id='line_5056'>Arthur’s hand.  Then Arthur composed this Englyn—</a>
<a id='line_5057'></a>
<a id='line_5058'>   Kai made a leash</a>
<a id='line_5059'>   Of Dillus son of Eurei’s beard.</a>
<a id='line_5060'>   Were he alive, thy death he’d be.</a>
<a id='line_5061'></a>
<a id='line_5062'>And thereupon Kai was wroth, so that the warriors of the Island could</a>
<a id='line_5063'>scarcely make peace between Kai and Arthur.  And thenceforth, neither in</a>
<a id='line_5064'>Arthur’s troubles, nor for the slaying of his men, would Kai come forward</a>
<a id='line_5065'>to his aid for ever after.</a>

<a id='line_5067'>                                * * * * *</a>
<a id='line_5068'></a>
<a id='line_5069'>Said Arthur, “Which of the marvels is it best for us now to seek?”  “It</a>
<a id='line_5070'>is best for us to seek Drudwyn, the cub of Greid the son of Eri.”</a>
<a id='line_5071'></a>
<a id='line_5072'>A little while before this, Creiddylad the daughter of Lludd Llaw Ereint,</a>
<a id='line_5073'>and Gwythyr the son of Greidawl, were betrothed.  And before she had</a>
<a id='line_5074'>become his bride, Gwyn ap Nudd came and carried her away by force; and</a>
<a id='line_5075'>Gwythyr the son of Greidawl gathered his host together, and went to fight</a>
<a id='line_5076'>with Gwyn ap Nudd.  But Gwyn overcame him, and captured Greid the son of</a>
<a id='line_5077'>Eri, and Glinneu the son of Taran, and Gwrgwst Ledlwm, and Dynvarth his</a>
<a id='line_5078'>son.  And he captured Penn the son of Nethawg, and Nwython, and Kyledyr</a>
<a id='line_5079'>Wyllt his son.  And they slew Nwython, and took out his heart, and</a>
<a id='line_5080'>constrained Kyledyr to eat the heart of his father.  And therefrom</a>
<a id='line_5081'>Kyledyr became mad.  When Arthur heard of this, he went to the North, and</a>
<a id='line_5082'>summoned Gwyn ap Nudd before him, and set free the nobles whom he had put</a>
<a id='line_5083'>in prison, and made peace between Gwyn ap Nudd and Gwythyr the son of</a>
<a id='line_5084'>Griedawl.  And this was the peace that was made:—that the maiden should</a>
<a id='line_5085'>remain in her father’s house, without advantage to either of them, and</a>
<a id='line_5086'>that Gwyn ap Nudd and Gwythyr the son of Greidawl should fight for her</a>
<a id='line_5087'>every first of May, from thenceforth until the day of doom, and that</a>
<a id='line_5088'>whichever of them should then be conqueror should have the maiden.</a>
<a id='line_5089'></a>
<a id='line_5090'>And when Arthur had thus reconciled these chieftains, he obtained Mygdwn,</a>
<a id='line_5091'>Gweddw’s horse, and the leash of Cwrs Cant Ewin.</a>
<a id='line_5092'></a>
<a id='line_5093'>And after that Arthur went into Armorica, and with him Mabon the son of</a>
<a id='line_5094'>Mellt, and Gware Gwallt Euryn, to seek the two dogs of Glythmyr Ledewic.</a>
<a id='line_5095'>And when he had got them, he went to the West of Ireland, in search of</a>
<a id='line_5096'>Gwrgi Seven; and Odgar the son of Aedd king of Ireland went with him.</a>
<a id='line_5097'>And thence went Arthur into the North, and captured Kyledyr Wyllt; and he</a>
<a id='line_5098'>went after Yskithyrwyn Penbaedd.  And Mabon the son of Mellt came with</a>
<a id='line_5099'>the two dogs of Glythmyr Ledewic in his hand, and Drudwyn, the cub of</a>
<a id='line_5100'>Greid the son of Eri.  And Arthur went himself to the chase, leading his</a>
<a id='line_5101'>own dog Cavall.  And Kaw, of North Britain, mounted Arthur’s mare</a>
<a id='line_5102'>Llamrei, and was first in the attack.  Then Kaw, of North Britain,</a>
<a id='line_5103'>wielded a mighty axe, and absolutely daring he came valiantly up to the</a>
<a id='line_5104'>boar, and clave his head in twain.  And Kaw took away the tusk.  Now the</a>
<a id='line_5105'>boar was not slain by the dogs that Yspaddaden had mentioned, but by</a>
<a id='line_5106'>Cavall, Arthur’s own dog.</a>
<a id='line_5107'></a>
<a id='line_5108'>And after Yskithyrwyn Penbaedd was killed, Arthur and his host departed</a>
<a id='line_5109'>to Gelli Wic in Cornwall.  And thence he sent Menw the son of Teirgwaedd</a>
<a id='line_5110'>to see if the precious things were between the two ears of Twrch Trwyth,</a>
<a id='line_5111'>since it were useless to encounter him if they were not there.  Albeit it</a>
<a id='line_5112'>was certain where he was, for he had laid waste the third part of</a>
<a id='line_5113'>Ireland.  And Menw went to seek for him, and he met with him in Ireland,</a>
<a id='line_5114'>in Esgeir Oervel.  And Menw took the form of a bird; and he descended</a>
<a id='line_5115'>upon the top of his lair, and strove to snatch away one of the precious</a>
<a id='line_5116'>things from him, but he carried away nothing but one of his bristles.</a>
<a id='line_5117'>And the boar rose up angrily and shook himself so that some of his venom</a>
<a id='line_5118'>fell upon Menw, and he was never well from that day forward.</a>
<a id='line_5119'></a>
<a id='line_5120'>After this Arthur sent an embassy to Odgar, the son of Aedd king of</a>
<a id='line_5121'>Ireland, to ask for the cauldron of Diwrnach Wyddel, his purveyor.  And</a>
<a id='line_5122'>Odgar commanded him to give it.  But Diwrnach said, “Heaven is my</a>
<a id='line_5123'>witness, if it would avail him anything even to look at it, he should not</a>
<a id='line_5124'>do so.”  And the embassy of Arthur returned from Ireland with this</a>
<a id='line_5125'>denial.  And Arthur set forward with a small retinue, and entered into</a>
<a id='line_5126'>Prydwen, his ship, and went over to Ireland.  And they proceeded into the</a>
<a id='line_5127'>house of Diwrnach Wyddel.  And the hosts of Odgar saw their strength.</a>
<a id='line_5128'>When they had eaten and drunk as much as they desired, Arthur demanded to</a>
<a id='line_5129'>have the cauldron.  And he answered, “If I would have given it to any</a>
<a id='line_5130'>one, I would have given it at the word of Odgar king of Ireland.”</a>
<a id='line_5131'></a>
<a id='line_5132'>When he had given them this denial, Bedwyr arose and seized hold of the</a>
<a id='line_5133'>cauldron, and placed it upon the back of Hygwyd, Arthur’s servant, who</a>
<a id='line_5134'>was brother, by the mother’s side, to Arthur’s servant, Cachamwri.  His</a>
<a id='line_5135'>office was always to carry Arthur’s cauldron, and to place fire under it.</a>
<a id='line_5136'>And Llenlleawg Wyddel seized Caledvwlch, and brandished it.  And they</a>
<a id='line_5137'>slew Diwrnach Wyddel and his company.  Then came the Irish and fought</a>
<a id='line_5138'>with them.  And when he had put them to flight, Arthur with his men went</a>
<a id='line_5139'>forward to the ship, carrying away the cauldron full of Irish money.  And</a>
<a id='line_5140'>he disembarked at the house of Llwydden the son of Kelcoed, at Porth</a>
<a id='line_5141'>Kerddin in Dyved.  And there is the measure of the cauldron.</a>
<a id='line_5142'></a>
<a id='line_5143'>Then Arthur summoned unto him all the warriors that were in the three</a>
<a id='line_5144'>Islands of Britain, and in the three Islands adjacent, and all that were</a>
<a id='line_5145'>in France and in Armorica, in Normandy and in the Summer Country, and all</a>
<a id='line_5146'>that were chosen footmen and valiant horsemen.  And with all these he</a>
<a id='line_5147'>went into Ireland.  And in Ireland there was great fear and terror</a>
<a id='line_5148'>concerning him.  And when Arthur had landed in the country, there came</a>
<a id='line_5149'>unto him the saints of Ireland and besought his protection.  And he</a>
<a id='line_5150'>granted his protection unto them, and they gave him their blessing.  Then</a>
<a id='line_5151'>the men of Ireland came unto Arthur, and brought him provisions.  And</a>
<a id='line_5152'>Arthur went as far as Esgeir Oervel in Ireland, to the place where the</a>
<a id='line_5153'>Boar Trwyth was with his seven young pigs.  And the dogs were let loose</a>
<a id='line_5154'>upon him from all sides.  That day until evening the Irish fought with</a>
<a id='line_5155'>him, nevertheless he laid waste the fifth part of Ireland.  And on the</a>
<a id='line_5156'>day following the household of Arthur fought with him, and they were</a>
<a id='line_5157'>worsted by him, and got no advantage.  And the third day Arthur himself</a>
<a id='line_5158'>encountered him, and he fought with him nine nights and nine days without</a>
<a id='line_5159'>so much as killing even one little pig.  The warriors inquired of Arthur</a>
<a id='line_5160'>what was the origin of that swine; and he told them that he was once a</a>
<a id='line_5161'>king, and that God had transformed him into a swine for his sins.</a>
<a id='line_5162'></a>
<a id='line_5163'>Then Arthur sent Gwrhyr Gwalstawt Ieithoedd, to endeavour to speak with</a>
<a id='line_5164'>him.  And Gwrhyr assumed the form of a bird, and alighted upon the top of</a>
<a id='line_5165'>the lair, where he was with the seven young pigs.  And Gwrhyr Gwalstawt</a>
<a id='line_5166'>Ieithoedd asked him, “By him who turned you into this form, if you can</a>
<a id='line_5167'>speak, let some one of you, I beseech you, come and talk with Arthur.”</a>
<a id='line_5168'>Grugyn Gwrych Ereint made answer to him.  (Now his bristles were like</a>
<a id='line_5169'>silver wire, and whether he went through the wood or through the plain,</a>
<a id='line_5170'>he was to be traced by the glittering of his bristles.)  And this was the</a>
<a id='line_5171'>answer that Grugyn made: “By him who turned us into this form, we will</a>
<a id='line_5172'>not do so, and we will not speak with Arthur.  That we have been</a>
<a id='line_5173'>transformed thus is enough for us to suffer, without your coming here to</a>
<a id='line_5174'>fight with us.”  “I will tell you.  Arthur comes but to fight for the</a>
<a id='line_5175'>comb, and the razor, and the scissors which are between the two ears of</a>
<a id='line_5176'>Twrch Trwyth.”  Said Grugyn, “Except he first take his life, he will</a>
<a id='line_5177'>never have those precious things.  And to-morrow morning we will rise up</a>
<a id='line_5178'>hence, and we will go into Arthur’s country, and there will we do all the</a>
<a id='line_5179'>mischief that we can.”</a>
<a id='line_5180'></a>
<a id='line_5181'>So they set forth through the sea towards Wales.  And Arthur and his</a>
<a id='line_5182'>hosts, and his horses and his dogs, entered Prydwen, that they might</a>
<a id='line_5183'>encounter them without delay.  Twrch Trwyth landed in Porth Cleis in</a>
<a id='line_5184'>Dyved, and Arthur came to Mynyw.  The next day it was told to Arthur that</a>
<a id='line_5185'>they had gone by, and he overtook them as they were killing the cattle of</a>
<a id='line_5186'>Kynnwas Kwrr y Vagyl, having slain all that were at Aber Gleddyf, of man</a>
<a id='line_5187'>and beast, before the coming of Arthur.</a>
<a id='line_5188'></a>
<a id='line_5189'>Now when Arthur approached, Twrch Trwyth went on as far as Preseleu, and</a>
<a id='line_5190'>Arthur and his hosts followed him thither, and Arthur sent men to hunt</a>
<a id='line_5191'>him; Eli and Trachmyr, leading Drudwyn the whelp of Greid the son of Eri,</a>
<a id='line_5192'>and Gwarthegyd the son of Kaw, in another quarter, with the two dogs of</a>
<a id='line_5193'>Glythmyr Ledewic, and Bedwyr leading Cavall, Arthur’s own dog.  And all</a>
<a id='line_5194'>the warriors ranged themselves around the Nyver.  And there came there</a>
<a id='line_5195'>the three sons of Cleddyf Divwlch, men who had gained much fame at the</a>
<a id='line_5196'>slaying of Yskithyrwyn Penbaedd; and they went on from Glyn Nyver, and</a>
<a id='line_5197'>came to Cwm Kerwyn.</a>
<a id='line_5198'></a>
<a id='line_5199'>And there Twrch Trwyth made a stand, and slew four of Arthur’s champions,</a>
<a id='line_5200'>Gwarthegyd the son of Kaw, and Tarawc of Allt Clwyd, and Rheidwn the son</a>
<a id='line_5201'>of Eli Atver, and Iscovan Hael.  And after he had slain these men, he</a>
<a id='line_5202'>made a second stand in the same place.  And there he slew Gwydre the son</a>
<a id='line_5203'>of Arthur, and Garselit Wyddel, and Glew the son of Ysgawd, and Iscawyn</a>
<a id='line_5204'>the son of Panon; and there he himself was wounded.</a>
<a id='line_5205'></a>
<a id='line_5206'>And the next morning before it was day, some of the men came up with him.</a>
<a id='line_5207'>And he slew Huandaw, and Gogigwr, and Penpingon, three attendants upon</a>
<a id='line_5208'>Glewlwyd Gavaelvawr, so that Heaven knows he had not an attendant</a>
<a id='line_5209'>remaining, excepting only Llaesgevyn, a man from whom no one ever derived</a>
<a id='line_5210'>any good.  And together with these he slew many of the men of that</a>
<a id='line_5211'>country, and Gwlydyn Saer, Arthur’s chief Architect.</a>
<a id='line_5212'></a>
<a id='line_5213'>Then Arthur overtook him at Pelumyawc, and there he slew Madawc the son</a>
<a id='line_5214'>of Teithyon, and Gwyn the son of Tringad, the son of Neved, and Eiryawn</a>
<a id='line_5215'>Penllorau.  Thence he went to Aberteivi, where he made another stand, and</a>
<a id='line_5216'>where he slew Kyflas the son of Kynan, and Gwilenhin king of France.</a>
<a id='line_5217'>Then he went as far as Glyn Ystu, and there the men and the dogs lost</a>
<a id='line_5218'>him.</a>
<a id='line_5219'></a>
<a id='line_5220'>Then Arthur summoned unto him Gwyn ab Nudd, and he asked him if he knew</a>
<a id='line_5221'>aught of Twrch Trwyth.  And he said that he did not.</a>
<a id='line_5222'></a>
<a id='line_5223'>And all the huntsmen went to hunt the swine as far as Dyffryn Llychwr.</a>
<a id='line_5224'>And Grugyn Gwallt Ereint and Llwydawg Govynnyad closed with them and</a>
<a id='line_5225'>killed all the huntsmen, so that there escaped but one man only.  And</a>
<a id='line_5226'>Arthur and his hosts came to the place where Grugyn and Llwydawg were.</a>
<a id='line_5227'>And there he let loose the whole of the dogs upon them, and with the</a>
<a id='line_5228'>shout and barking that was set up, Twrch Trwyth came to their assistance.</a>
<a id='line_5229'></a>
<a id='line_5230'>And from the time that they came across the Irish sea, Arthur had never</a>
<a id='line_5231'>got sight of him until then.  So he set men and dogs upon him, and</a>
<a id='line_5232'>thereupon he started off and went to Mynydd Amanw.  And there one of his</a>
<a id='line_5233'>young pigs was killed.  Then they set upon him life for life, and Twrch</a>
<a id='line_5234'>Llawin was slain, and then there was slain another of the swine, Gwys was</a>
<a id='line_5235'>his name.  After that he went on to Dyffryn Amanw, and there Banw and</a>
<a id='line_5236'>Bennwig were killed.  Of all his pigs there went with him alive from that</a>
<a id='line_5237'>place none save Grugyn Gwallt Ereint and Llwydawg Govynnyad.</a>
<a id='line_5238'></a>
<a id='line_5239'>Thence he went on to Llwch Ewin, and Arthur overtook him there, and he</a>
<a id='line_5240'>made a stand.  And there he slew Echel Forddwytwll, and Garwyli the son</a>
<a id='line_5241'>of Gwyddawg Gwyr, and many men and dogs likewise.  And thence they went</a>
<a id='line_5242'>to Llwch Tawy.  Grugyn Gwrych Ereint parted from them there, and went to</a>
<a id='line_5243'>Din Tywi.  And thence he proceeded to Ceredigiawn, and Eli and Trachmyr</a>
<a id='line_5244'>with him, and a multitude likewise.  Then he came to Garth Gregyn, and</a>
<a id='line_5245'>there Llwydawg Govynnyad fought in the midst of them, and slew Rhudvyw</a>
<a id='line_5246'>Rhys and many others with him.  Then Llwydawg went thence to Ystrad Yw,</a>
<a id='line_5247'>and there the men of Armorica met him, and there he slew Hirpeissawg the</a>
<a id='line_5248'>king of Armorica, and Llygatrudd Emys, and Gwrbothu, Arthur’s uncles, his</a>
<a id='line_5249'>mother’s brothers, and there was he himself slain.</a>
<a id='line_5250'></a>
<a id='line_5251'>Twrch Trwyth went from there to between Tawy and Euyas, and Arthur</a>
<a id='line_5252'>summoned all Cornwall and Devon unto him, to the estuary of the Severn,</a>
<a id='line_5253'>and he said to the warriors of this Island, “Twrch Trwyth has slain many</a>
<a id='line_5254'>of my men, but, by the valour of warriors, while I live he shall not go</a>
<a id='line_5255'>into Cornwall.  And I will not follow him any longer, but I will oppose</a>
<a id='line_5256'>him life to life.  Do ye as ye will.”  And he resolved that he would send</a>
<a id='line_5257'>a body of knights, with the dogs of the Island, as far as Euyas, who</a>
<a id='line_5258'>should return thence to the Severn, and that tried warriors should</a>
<a id='line_5259'>traverse the Island, and force him into the Severn.  And Mabon the son of</a>
<a id='line_5260'>Modron came up with him at the Severn, upon Gwynn Mygdwn, the horse of</a>
<a id='line_5261'>Gweddw, and Goreu the son of Custennin, and Menw the son of Teirgwaedd;</a>
<a id='line_5262'>this was betwixt Llyn Lliwan and Aber Gwy.  And Arthur fell upon him</a>
<a id='line_5263'>together with the champions of Britain.  And Osla Kyllellvawr drew near,</a>
<a id='line_5264'>and Manawyddan the son of Llyr, and Kacmwri the servant of Arthur, and</a>
<a id='line_5265'>Gwyngelli, and they seized hold of him, catching him first by his feet,</a>
<a id='line_5266'>and plunged him in the Severn, so that it overwhelmed him.  On the one</a>
<a id='line_5267'>side, Mabon the son of Modron spurred his steed and snatched his razor</a>
<a id='line_5268'>from him, and Kyledyr Wyllt came up with him on the other side, upon</a>
<a id='line_5269'>another steed, in the Severn, and took from him the scissors.  But before</a>
<a id='line_5270'>they could obtain the comb, he had regained the ground with his feet, and</a>
<a id='line_5271'>from the moment that he reached the shore, neither dog, nor man, nor</a>
<a id='line_5272'>horse could overtake him until he came to Cornwall.  If they had had</a>
<a id='line_5273'>trouble in getting the jewels from him, much more had they in seeking to</a>
<a id='line_5274'>save the two men from being drowned.  Kacmwri, as they drew him forth,</a>
<a id='line_5275'>was dragged by two millstones into the deep.  And as Osla Kyllellvawr was</a>
<a id='line_5276'>running after the boar, his knife had dropped out of the sheath, and he</a>
<a id='line_5277'>had lost it, and after that, the sheath became full of water, and its</a>
<a id='line_5278'>weight drew him down into the deep, as they were drawing him forth.</a>
<a id='line_5279'></a>
<a id='line_5280'>Then Arthur and his hosts proceeded until they overtook the boar in</a>
<a id='line_5281'>Cornwall, and the trouble which they had met with before was mere play to</a>
<a id='line_5282'>what they encountered in seeking the comb.  But from one difficulty to</a>
<a id='line_5283'>another, the comb was at length obtained.  And then he was hunted from</a>
<a id='line_5284'>Cornwall, and driven straight forward into the deep sea.  And thenceforth</a>
<a id='line_5285'>it was never known whither he went; and Aned and Aethlem with him.  Then</a>
<a id='line_5286'>went Arthur to Gelli Wic, in Cornwall, to anoint himself, and to rest</a>
<a id='line_5287'>from his fatigues.</a>
<a id='line_5288'></a>
<a id='line_5289'>Said Arthur, “Is there any one of the marvels yet unobtained?”  Said one</a>
<a id='line_5290'>of his men, “There is—the blood of the witch Orddu, the daughter of the</a>
<a id='line_5291'>witch Orwen, of Pen Nant Govid, on the confines of Hell.”  Arthur set</a>
<a id='line_5292'>forth towards the North, and came to the place where was the witch’s</a>
<a id='line_5293'>cave.  And Gwyn ab Nudd, and Gwythyr the son of Greidawl, counselled him</a>
<a id='line_5294'>to send Kacmwri, and Hygwyd his brother, to fight with the witch.  And as</a>
<a id='line_5295'>they entered the cave, the witch seized upon them, and she caught Hygwyd</a>
<a id='line_5296'>by the hair of his head, and threw him on the floor beneath her.  And</a>
<a id='line_5297'>Kacmwri caught her by the hair of her head, and dragged her to the earth</a>
<a id='line_5298'>from off Hygwyd, but she turned again upon them both, and drove them both</a>
<a id='line_5299'>out with kicks and with cuffs.</a>
<a id='line_5300'></a>
<a id='line_5301'>And Arthur was wroth at seeing his two attendants almost slain, and he</a>
<a id='line_5302'>sought to enter the cave; but Gwyn and Gwythyr said unto him, “It would</a>
<a id='line_5303'>not be fitting or seemly for us to see thee squabbling with a hag.  Let</a>
<a id='line_5304'>Hiramreu and Hireidil go to the cave.”  So they went.  But if great was</a>
<a id='line_5305'>the trouble of the first two that went, much greater was that of these</a>
<a id='line_5306'>two.  And Heaven knows that not one of the four could move from the spot,</a>
<a id='line_5307'>until they placed them all upon Llamrei, Arthur’s mare.  And then Arthur</a>
<a id='line_5308'>rushed to the door of the cave, and at the door he struck at the witch,</a>
<a id='line_5309'>with Carnwennan his dagger, and clove her in twain, so that she fell in</a>
<a id='line_5310'>two parts.  And Kaw, of North Britain, took the blood of the witch and</a>
<a id='line_5311'>kept it.</a>
<a id='line_5312'></a>
<a id='line_5313'>Then Kilhwch set forward, and Goreu the son of Custennin with him, and as</a>
<a id='line_5314'>many as wished ill to Yspaddaden Penkawr.  And they took the marvels with</a>
<a id='line_5315'>them to his court.  And Kaw of North Britain came and shaved his beard,</a>
<a id='line_5316'>skin, and flesh clean off to the very bone from ear to ear.  “Art thou</a>
<a id='line_5317'>shaved, man?” said Kilhwch.  “I am shaved,” answered he.  “Is thy</a>
<a id='line_5318'>daughter mine now?”  “She is thine,” said he, “but therefore needest thou</a>
<a id='line_5319'>not thank me, but Arthur who hath accomplished this for thee.  By my free</a>
<a id='line_5320'>will thou shouldest never have had her, for with her I lose my life.”</a>
<a id='line_5321'>Then Goreu the son of Custennin seized him by the hair of his head, and</a>
<a id='line_5322'>dragged him after him to the keep, and cut off his head and placed it on</a>
<a id='line_5323'>a stake on the citadel.  Then they took possession of his castle, and of</a>
<a id='line_5324'>his treasures.</a>
<a id='line_5325'></a>
<a id='line_5326'>And that night Olwen became Kilhwch’s bride, and she continued to be his</a>
<a id='line_5327'>wife as long as she lived.  And the hosts of Arthur dispersed themselves,</a>
<a id='line_5328'>each man to his own country.  And thus did Kilhwch obtain Olwen, the</a>
<a id='line_5329'>daughter of Yspaddaden Penkawr.</a>
<a id='line_5330'></a>
<a id='line_5331'></a>
<a id='line_5332'></a>
<a id='line_5333'></a>
<a id='line_5334'>THE DREAM OF RHONABWY</a>
<a id='line_5335'></a>
<a id='line_5336'></a>
<a id='line_5337'>MADAWC the son of Maredudd possessed Powys within its boundaries, from</a>
<a id='line_5338'>Porfoed to Gwauan in the uplands of Arwystli.  And at that time he had a</a>
<a id='line_5339'>brother, Iorwerth the son of Maredudd, in rank not equal to himself.  And</a>
<a id='line_5340'>Iorwerth had great sorrow and heaviness because of the honour and power</a>
<a id='line_5341'>that his brother enjoyed, which he shared not.  And he sought his fellows</a>
<a id='line_5342'>and his foster-brothers, and took counsel with them what he should do in</a>
<a id='line_5343'>this matter.  And they resolved to dispatch some of their number to go</a>
<a id='line_5344'>and seek a maintenance for him.  Then Madawc offered him to become Master</a>
<a id='line_5345'>of the Household and to have horses, and arms, and honour, and to fare</a>
<a id='line_5346'>like as himself.  But Iorwerth refused this.</a>
<a id='line_5347'></a>
<a id='line_5348'>And Iorwerth made an inroad into Loegria, slaying the inhabitants, and</a>
<a id='line_5349'>burning houses, and carrying away prisoners.  And Madawc took counsel</a>
<a id='line_5350'>with the men of Powys, and they determined to place an hundred men in</a>
<a id='line_5351'>each of the three Commots of Powys to seek for him.  And thus did they in</a>
<a id='line_5352'>the plains of Powys from Aber Ceirawc, and in Allictwn Ver, and in Rhyd</a>
<a id='line_5353'>Wilure, on the Vyrnwy, the three best Commots of Powys.  So he was none</a>
<a id='line_5354'>the better, he nor his household, in Powys, nor in the plains thereof.</a>
<a id='line_5355'>And they spread these men over the plains as far as Nillystwn Trevan.</a>
<a id='line_5356'></a>
<a id='line_5357'>Now one of the men who was upon this quest was called Rhonabwy.  And</a>
<a id='line_5358'>Rhonabwy and Kynwrig Vrychgoch, a man of Mawddwy, and Cadwgan Vras, a man</a>
<a id='line_5359'>of Moelvre in Kynlleith, came together to the house of Heilyn Goch the</a>
<a id='line_5360'>son of Cadwgan the son of Iddon.  And when they came near to the house,</a>
<a id='line_5361'>they saw an old hall, very black and having an upright gable, whence</a>
<a id='line_5362'>issued a great smoke; and on entering, they found the floor full of</a>
<a id='line_5363'>puddles and mounds; and it was difficult to stand thereon, so slippery</a>
<a id='line_5364'>was it with the mire of cattle.  And where the puddles were, a man might</a>
<a id='line_5365'>go up to his ankles in water and dirt.  And there were boughs of holly</a>
<a id='line_5366'>spread over the floor, whereof the cattle had browsed the sprigs.  When</a>
<a id='line_5367'>they came to the hall of the house, they beheld cells full of dust, and</a>
<a id='line_5368'>very gloomy, and on one side an old hag making a fire.  And whenever she</a>
<a id='line_5369'>felt cold, she cast a lapful of chaff upon the fire, and raised such a</a>
<a id='line_5370'>smoke, that it was scarcely to be borne, as it rose up the nostrils.  And</a>
<a id='line_5371'>on the other side was a yellow calf-skin on the floor; a main privilege</a>
<a id='line_5372'>was it to any one who should get upon that hide.</a>
<a id='line_5373'></a>
<a id='line_5374'>And when they had sat down, they asked the hag where were the people of</a>
<a id='line_5375'>the house.  And the hag spoke not, but muttered.  Thereupon behold the</a>
<a id='line_5376'>people of the house entered; a ruddy, clownish, curly-headed man, with a</a>
<a id='line_5377'>burthen of faggots on his back, and a pale slender woman, also carrying a</a>
<a id='line_5378'>bundle under her arm.  And they barely welcomed the men, and kindled a</a>
<a id='line_5379'>fire with the boughs.  And the woman cooked something, and gave them to</a>
<a id='line_5380'>eat, barley bread, and cheese, and milk and water.</a>
<a id='line_5381'></a>
<a id='line_5382'>And there arose a storm of wind and rain, so that it was hardly possible</a>
<a id='line_5383'>to go forth with safety.  And being weary with their journey, they laid</a>
<a id='line_5384'>themselves down and sought to sleep.  And when they looked at the couch,</a>
<a id='line_5385'>it seemed to be made but of a little coarse straw full of dust and</a>
<a id='line_5386'>vermin, with the stems of boughs sticking up there-through, for the</a>
<a id='line_5387'>cattle had eaten all the straw that was placed at the head and the foot.</a>
<a id='line_5388'>And upon it was stretched an old russet-coloured rug, threadbare and</a>
<a id='line_5389'>ragged; and a coarse sheet, full of slits, was upon the rug, and an</a>
<a id='line_5390'>ill-stuffed pillow, and a worn-out cover upon the sheet.  And after much</a>
<a id='line_5391'>suffering from the vermin, and from the discomfort of their couch, a</a>
<a id='line_5392'>heavy sleep fell on Rhonabwy’s companions.  But Rhonabwy, not being able</a>
<a id='line_5393'>either to sleep or to rest, thought he should suffer less if he went to</a>
<a id='line_5394'>lie upon the yellow calf-skin that was stretched out on the floor.  And</a>
<a id='line_5395'>there he slept.</a>
<a id='line_5396'></a>
<a id='line_5397'>As soon as sleep had come upon his eyes, it seemed to him that he was</a>
<a id='line_5398'>journeying with his companions across the plain of Argyngroeg, and he</a>
<a id='line_5399'>thought that he went towards Rhyd y Groes on the Severn.  As he</a>
<a id='line_5400'>journeyed, he heard a mighty noise, the like whereof heard he never</a>
<a id='line_5401'>before; and looking behind him, he beheld a youth with yellow curling</a>
<a id='line_5402'>hair, and with his beard newly trimmed, mounted on a chestnut horse,</a>
<a id='line_5403'>whereof the legs were grey from the top of the forelegs, and from the</a>
<a id='line_5404'>bend of the hindlegs downwards.  And the rider wore a coat of yellow</a>
<a id='line_5405'>satin sewn with green silk, and on his thigh was a gold-hilted sword,</a>
<a id='line_5406'>with a scabbard of new leather of Cordova, belted with the skin of the</a>
<a id='line_5407'>deer, and clasped with gold.  And over this was a scarf of yellow satin</a>
<a id='line_5408'>wrought with green silk, the borders whereof were likewise green.  And</a>
<a id='line_5409'>the green of the caparison of the horse, and of his rider, was as green</a>
<a id='line_5410'>as the leaves of the fir-tree, and the yellow was as yellow as the</a>
<a id='line_5411'>blossom of the broom.  So fierce was the aspect of the knight, that fear</a>
<a id='line_5412'>seized upon them, and they began to flee.  And the knight pursued them.</a>
<a id='line_5413'>And when the horse breathed forth, the men became distant from him, and</a>
<a id='line_5414'>when he drew in his breath, they were drawn near to him, even to the</a>
<a id='line_5415'>horse’s chest.  And when he had overtaken them, they besought his mercy.</a>
<a id='line_5416'>“You have it gladly,” said he, “fear nought.”  “Ha, chieftain, since thou</a>
<a id='line_5417'>hast mercy upon me, tell me also who thou art,” said Rhonabwy.  “I will</a>
<a id='line_5418'>not conceal my lineage from thee, I am Iddawc the son of Mynyo, yet not</a>
<a id='line_5419'>by my name, but by my nickname am I best known.”  “And wilt thou tell us</a>
<a id='line_5420'>what thy nickname is?”  “I will tell you; it is Iddawc Cordd Prydain.”</a>
<a id='line_5421'>“Ha, chieftain,” said Rhonabwy, “why art thou called thus?”  “I will tell</a>
<a id='line_5422'>thee.  I was one of the messengers between Arthur and Medrawd his nephew,</a>
<a id='line_5423'>at the battle of Camlan; and I was then a reckless youth, and through my</a>
<a id='line_5424'>desire for battle, I kindled strife between them, and stirred up wrath,</a>
<a id='line_5425'>when I was sent by Arthur the Emperor to reason with Medrawd, and to show</a>
<a id='line_5426'>him, that he was his foster-father and his uncle, and to seek for peace,</a>
<a id='line_5427'>lest the sons of the Kings of the Island of Britain, and of the nobles,</a>
<a id='line_5428'>should be slain.  And whereas Arthur charged me with the fairest sayings</a>
<a id='line_5429'>he could think of, I uttered unto Medrawd the harshest I could devise.</a>
<a id='line_5430'>And therefore am I called Iddawc Cordd Prydain, for from this did the</a>
<a id='line_5431'>battle of Camlan ensue.  And three nights before the end of the battle of</a>
<a id='line_5432'>Camlan I left them, and went to the Llech Las in North Britain to do</a>
<a id='line_5433'>penance.  And there I remained doing penance seven years, and after that</a>
<a id='line_5434'>I gained pardon.”</a>
<a id='line_5435'></a>
<a id='line_5436'>Then lo! they heard a mighty sound which was much louder than that which</a>
<a id='line_5437'>they had heard before, and when they looked round towards the sound, they</a>
<a id='line_5438'>beheld a ruddy youth, without beard or whiskers, noble of mien, and</a>
<a id='line_5439'>mounted on a stately courser.  And from the shoulders and the front of</a>
<a id='line_5440'>the knees downwards the horse was bay.  And upon the man was a dress of</a>
<a id='line_5441'>red satin wrought with yellow silk, and yellow were the borders of his</a>
<a id='line_5442'>scarf.  And such parts of his apparel and of the trappings of his horse</a>
<a id='line_5443'>as were yellow, as yellow were they as the blossom of the broom, and such</a>
<a id='line_5444'>as were red, were as ruddy as the ruddiest blood in the world.</a>
<a id='line_5445'></a>
<a id='line_5446'>Then, behold the horseman overtook them, and he asked of Iddawc a share</a>
<a id='line_5447'>of the little men that were with him.  “That which is fitting for me to</a>
<a id='line_5448'>grant I will grant, and thou shalt be a companion to them as I have</a>
<a id='line_5449'>been.”  And the horseman went away.  “Iddawc,” inquired Rhonabwy, “who</a>
<a id='line_5450'>was that horseman?”  “Rhuvawn Pebyr the son of Prince Deorthach.”</a>
<a id='line_5451'></a>
<a id='line_5452'>And they journeyed over the plain of Argyngroeg as far as the ford of</a>
<a id='line_5453'>Rhyd y Groes on the Severn.  And for a mile around the ford on both sides</a>
<a id='line_5454'>of the road, they saw tents and encampments, and there was the clamour of</a>
<a id='line_5455'>a mighty host.  And they came to the edge of the ford, and there they</a>
<a id='line_5456'>beheld Arthur sitting on a flat island below the ford, having Bedwini the</a>
<a id='line_5457'>Bishop on one side of him, and Gwarthegyd the son of Kaw on the other.</a>
<a id='line_5458'>And a tall, auburn-haired youth stood before him, with his sheathed sword</a>
<a id='line_5459'>in his hand, and clad in a coat and cap of jet-black satin.  And his face</a>
<a id='line_5460'>was white as ivory, and his eyebrows black as jet, and such part of his</a>
<a id='line_5461'>wrist as could be seen between his glove and his sleeve, was whiter than</a>
<a id='line_5462'>the lily, and thicker than a warrior’s ankle.</a>
<a id='line_5463'></a>
<a id='line_5464'>Then came Iddawc and they that were with him, and stood before Arthur and</a>
<a id='line_5465'>saluted him.  “Heaven grant thee good,” said Arthur.  “And where, Iddawc,</a>
<a id='line_5466'>didst thou find these little men?”  “I found them, lord, up yonder on the</a>
<a id='line_5467'>road.”  Then the Emperor smiled.  “Lord,” said Iddawc, “wherefore dost</a>
<a id='line_5468'>thou laugh?”  “Iddawc,” replied Arthur, “I laugh not; but it pitieth me</a>
<a id='line_5469'>that men of such stature as these should have this island in their</a>
<a id='line_5470'>keeping, after the men that guarded it of yore.”  Then said Iddawc,</a>
<a id='line_5471'>“Rhonabwy, dost thou see the ring with a stone set in it, that is upon</a>
<a id='line_5472'>the Emperor’s hand?”  “I see it,” he answered.  “It is one of the</a>
<a id='line_5473'>properties of that stone to enable thee to remember that thou seest here</a>
<a id='line_5474'>to-night, and hadst thou not seen the stone, thou wouldest never have</a>
<a id='line_5475'>been able to remember aught thereof.”</a>
<a id='line_5476'></a>
<a id='line_5477'>After this they saw a troop coming towards the ford.  “Iddawc,” inquired</a>
<a id='line_5478'>Rhonabwy, “to whom does yonder troop belong?”  “They are the fellows of</a>
<a id='line_5479'>Rhuvawn Pebyr the son of Prince Deorthach.  And these men are honourably</a>
<a id='line_5480'>served with mead and bragget, and are freely beloved by the daughters of</a>
<a id='line_5481'>the kings of the Island of Britain.  And this they merit, for they were</a>
<a id='line_5482'>ever in the front and the rear in every peril.”  And he saw but one hue</a>
<a id='line_5483'>upon the men and the horses of this troop, for they were all as red as</a>
<a id='line_5484'>blood.  And when one of the knights rode forth from the troop, he looked</a>
<a id='line_5485'>like a pillar of fire glancing athwart the sky.  And this troop encamped</a>
<a id='line_5486'>above the ford.</a>
<a id='line_5487'></a>
<a id='line_5488'>Then they beheld another troop coming towards the ford, and these from</a>
<a id='line_5489'>their horses’ chests upwards were whiter than the lily, and below blacker</a>
<a id='line_5490'>than jet.  And they saw one of these knights go before the rest, and spur</a>
<a id='line_5491'>his horse into the ford in such a manner that the water dashed over</a>
<a id='line_5492'>Arthur and the Bishop, and those holding counsel with them, so that they</a>
<a id='line_5493'>were as wet as if they had been drenched in the river.  And as he turned</a>
<a id='line_5494'>the head of his horse, the youth who stood before Arthur struck the horse</a>
<a id='line_5495'>over the nostrils with his sheathed sword, so that, had it been with the</a>
<a id='line_5496'>bare blade, it would have been a marvel if the bone had not been wounded</a>
<a id='line_5497'>as well as the flesh.  And the knight drew his sword half out of the</a>
<a id='line_5498'>scabbard, and asked of him, “Wherefore didst thou strike my horse?</a>
<a id='line_5499'>Whether was it in insult or in counsel unto me?”  “Thou dost indeed lack</a>
<a id='line_5500'>counsel.  What madness caused thee to ride so furiously as to dash the</a>
<a id='line_5501'>water of the ford over Arthur, and the consecrated Bishop, and their</a>
<a id='line_5502'>counsellors, so that they were as wet as if they had been dragged out of</a>
<a id='line_5503'>the river?”  “As counsel then will I take it.”  So he turned his horse’s</a>
<a id='line_5504'>head round towards his army.</a>
<a id='line_5505'></a>
<a id='line_5506'>“Iddawc,” said Rhonabwy, “who was yonder knight?”  “The most eloquent and</a>
<a id='line_5507'>the wisest youth that is in this island; Adaon, the son of Taliesin.”</a>
<a id='line_5508'>“Who was the man that struck his horse?”  “A youth of froward nature;</a>
<a id='line_5509'>Elphin, the son of Gwyddno.”</a>
<a id='line_5510'></a>
<a id='line_5511'>Then spake a tall and stately man, of noble and flowing speech, saying</a>
<a id='line_5512'>that it was a marvel that so vast a host should be assembled in so narrow</a>
<a id='line_5513'>a space, and that it was a still greater marvel that those should be</a>
<a id='line_5514'>there at that time who had promised to be by mid-day in the battle of</a>
<a id='line_5515'>Badon, fighting with Osla Gyllellvawr.  “Whether thou mayest choose to</a>
<a id='line_5516'>proceed or not, I will proceed.”  “Thou sayest well,” said Arthur, “and</a>
<a id='line_5517'>we will go altogether.”  “Iddawc,” said Rhonabwy, “who was the man who</a>
<a id='line_5518'>spoke so marvellously unto Arthur erewhile?”  “A man who may speak as</a>
<a id='line_5519'>boldly as he listeth, Caradawc Vreichvras, the son of Llyr Marini, his</a>
<a id='line_5520'>chief counsellor and his cousin.”</a>
<a id='line_5521'></a>
<a id='line_5522'>Then Iddawc took Rhonabwy behind him on his horse, and that mighty host</a>
<a id='line_5523'>moved forward, each troop in its order, towards Cevndigoll.  And when</a>
<a id='line_5524'>they came to the middle of the ford of the Severn, Iddawc turned his</a>
<a id='line_5525'>horse’s head, and Rhonabwy looked along the valley of the Severn.  And he</a>
<a id='line_5526'>beheld two fair troops coming towards the ford.  One troop there came of</a>
<a id='line_5527'>brilliant white, whereof every one of the men had a scarf of white satin</a>
<a id='line_5528'>with jet-black borders.  And the knees and the tops of the shoulders of</a>
<a id='line_5529'>their horses were jet-black, though they were of a pure white in every</a>
<a id='line_5530'>other part.  And their banners were pure white, with black points to them</a>
<a id='line_5531'>all.</a>
<a id='line_5532'></a>
<a id='line_5533'>“Iddawc,” said Rhonabwy, “who are yonder pure white troop?”  “They are</a>
<a id='line_5534'>the men of Norway, and March the son of Meirchion is their prince.  And</a>
<a id='line_5535'>he is cousin unto Arthur.”  And further on he saw a troop, whereof each</a>
<a id='line_5536'>man wore garments of jet-black, with borders of pure white to every</a>
<a id='line_5537'>scarf; and the tops of the shoulders and the knees of their horses were</a>
<a id='line_5538'>pure white.  And their banners were jet-black with pure white at the</a>
<a id='line_5539'>point of each.</a>
<a id='line_5540'></a>
<a id='line_5541'>“Iddawc,” said Rhonabwy, “who are the jet-black troop yonder?”  “They are</a>
<a id='line_5542'>the men of Denmark, and Edeyrn the son of Nudd is their prince.”</a>
<a id='line_5543'></a>
<a id='line_5544'>And when they had overtaken the host, Arthur and his army of mighty ones</a>
<a id='line_5545'>dismounted below Caer Badou, and he perceived that he and Iddawc</a>
<a id='line_5546'>journeyed the same road as Arthur.  And after they had dismounted he</a>
<a id='line_5547'>heard a great tumult and confusion amongst the host, and such as were</a>
<a id='line_5548'>then at the flanks turned to the centre, and such as had been in the</a>
<a id='line_5549'>centre moved to the flanks.  And then, behold, he saw a knight coming,</a>
<a id='line_5550'>clad, both he and his horse, in mail, of which the rings were whiter than</a>
<a id='line_5551'>the whitest lily, and the rivets redder than the ruddiest blood.  And he</a>
<a id='line_5552'>rode amongst the host.</a>
<a id='line_5553'></a>
<a id='line_5554'>“Iddawc,” said Rhonabwy, “will yonder host flee?”  “King Arthur never</a>
<a id='line_5555'>fled, and if this discourse of thine were heard, thou wert a lost man.</a>
<a id='line_5556'>But as to the knight whom thou seest yonder, it is Kai.  The fairest</a>
<a id='line_5557'>horseman is Kai in all Arthur’s Court; and the men who are at the front</a>
<a id='line_5558'>of the army hasten to the rear to see Kai ride, and the men who are in</a>
<a id='line_5559'>the centre flee to the side, from the shock of his horse.  And this is</a>
<a id='line_5560'>the cause of the confusion of the host.”</a>
<a id='line_5561'></a>
<a id='line_5562'>Thereupon they heard a call made for Kadwr, Earl of Cornwall, and behold</a>
<a id='line_5563'>he arose with the sword of Arthur in his hand.  And the similitude of two</a>
<a id='line_5564'>serpents was upon the sword in gold.  And when the sword was drawn from</a>
<a id='line_5565'>its scabbard, it seemed as if two flames of fire burst forth from the</a>
<a id='line_5566'>jaws of the serpents, and then, so wonderful was the sword, that it was</a>
<a id='line_5567'>hard for any one to look upon it.  And the host became still, and the</a>
<a id='line_5568'>tumult ceased, and the Earl returned to the tent.</a>
<a id='line_5569'></a>
<a id='line_5570'>“Iddawc,” said Rhonabwy, “who is the man who bore the sword of Arthur?”</a>
<a id='line_5571'>“Kadwr, the Earl of Cornwall, whose duty it is to arm the King on the</a>
<a id='line_5572'>days of battle and warfare.”</a>
<a id='line_5573'></a>
<a id='line_5574'>And they heard a call made for Eirynwych Amheibyn, Arthur’s servant, a</a>
<a id='line_5575'>red, rough, ill-favoured man, having red whiskers with bristly hairs.</a>
<a id='line_5576'>And behold he came upon a tall red horse with the mane parted on each</a>
<a id='line_5577'>side, and he brought with him a large and beautiful sumpter pack.  And</a>
<a id='line_5578'>the huge red youth dismounted before Arthur, and he drew a golden chair</a>
<a id='line_5579'>out of the pack, and a carpet of diapered satin.  And he spread the</a>
<a id='line_5580'>carpet before Arthur, and there was an apple of ruddy gold at each corner</a>
<a id='line_5581'>thereof, and he placed the chair upon the carpet.  And so large was the</a>
<a id='line_5582'>chair that three armed warriors might have sat therein.  Gwenn was the</a>
<a id='line_5583'>name of the carpet, and it was one of its properties that whoever was</a>
<a id='line_5584'>upon it no one could see him, and he could see every one.  And it would</a>
<a id='line_5585'>retain no colour but its own.</a>
<a id='line_5586'></a>
<a id='line_5587'>And Arthur sat within the carpet, and Owain the son of Urien was standing</a>
<a id='line_5588'>before him.  “Owain,” said Arthur, “wilt thou play chess?”  “I will,</a>
<a id='line_5589'>Lord,” said Owain.  And the red youth brought the chess for Arthur and</a>
<a id='line_5590'>Owain; golden pieces and a board of silver.  And they began to play.</a>
<a id='line_5591'></a>
<a id='line_5592'>And while they were thus, and when they were best amused with their game,</a>
<a id='line_5593'>behold they saw a white tent with a red canopy, and the figure of a</a>
<a id='line_5594'>jet-black serpent on the top of the tent, and red glaring venomous eyes</a>
<a id='line_5595'>in the head of the serpent, and a red flaming tongue.  And there came a</a>
<a id='line_5596'>young page with yellow curling hair, and blue eyes, and a newly-springing</a>
<a id='line_5597'>beard, wearing a coat and a surcoat of yellow satin, and hose of thin</a>
<a id='line_5598'>greenish-yellow cloth upon his feet, and over his hose shoes of</a>
<a id='line_5599'>parti-coloured leather, fastened at the insteps with golden clasps.  And</a>
<a id='line_5600'>he bore a heavy three-edged sword with a golden hilt, in a scabbard of</a>
<a id='line_5601'>black leather tipped with fine gold.  And he came to the place where the</a>
<a id='line_5602'>Emperor and Owain were playing at chess.</a>
<a id='line_5603'></a>
<a id='line_5604'>And the youth saluted Owain.  And Owain marvelled that the youth should</a>
<a id='line_5605'>salute him and should not have saluted the Emperor Arthur.  And Arthur</a>
<a id='line_5606'>knew what was in Owain’s thought.  And he said to Owain, “Marvel not that</a>
<a id='line_5607'>the youth salutes thee now, for he saluted me erewhile; and it is unto</a>
<a id='line_5608'>thee that his errand is.”  Then said the youth unto Owain, “Lord, is it</a>
<a id='line_5609'>with thy leave that the young pages and attendants of the Emperor harass</a>
<a id='line_5610'>and torment and worry thy Ravens?  And if it be not with thy leave, cause</a>
<a id='line_5611'>the Emperor to forbid them.”  “Lord,” said Owain, “thou hearest what the</a>
<a id='line_5612'>youth says; if it seem good to thee, forbid them from my Ravens.”  “Play</a>
<a id='line_5613'>thy game,” said he.  Then the youth returned to the tent.</a>
<a id='line_5614'></a>
<a id='line_5615'>That game did they finish, and another they began, and when they were in</a>
<a id='line_5616'>the midst of the game, behold, a ruddy young man with auburn curling hair</a>
<a id='line_5617'>and large eyes, well-grown, and having his beard new-shorn, came forth</a>
<a id='line_5618'>from a bright yellow tent, upon the summit of which was the figure of a</a>
<a id='line_5619'>bright red lion.  And he was clad in a coat of yellow satin, falling as</a>
<a id='line_5620'>low as the small of his leg, and embroidered with threads of red silk.</a>
<a id='line_5621'>And on his feet were hose of fine white buckram, and buskins of black</a>
<a id='line_5622'>leather were over his hose, whereon were golden clasps.  And in his hand</a>
<a id='line_5623'>a huge, heavy, three-edged sword, with a scabbard of red deer-hide,</a>
<a id='line_5624'>tipped with gold.  And he came to the place where Arthur and Owain were</a>
<a id='line_5625'>playing at chess.  And he saluted him.  And Owain was troubled at his</a>
<a id='line_5626'>salutation, but Arthur minded it no more than before.  And the youth said</a>
<a id='line_5627'>unto Owain, “Is it not against thy will that the attendants of the</a>
<a id='line_5628'>Emperor harass thy Ravens, killing some and worrying others?  If against</a>
<a id='line_5629'>thy will it be, beseech him to forbid them.”  “Lord,” said Owain, “forbid</a>
<a id='line_5630'>thy men, if it seem good to thee.”  “Play thy game,” said the Emperor.</a>
<a id='line_5631'>And the youth returned to the tent.</a>
<a id='line_5632'></a>
<a id='line_5633'>And that game was ended and another begun.  And as they were beginning</a>
<a id='line_5634'>the first move of the game, they beheld at a small distance from them a</a>
<a id='line_5635'>tent speckled yellow, the largest ever seen, and the figure of an eagle</a>
<a id='line_5636'>of gold upon it, and a precious stone on the eagle’s head.  And coming</a>
<a id='line_5637'>out of the tent, they saw a youth with thick yellow hair upon his head,</a>
<a id='line_5638'>fair and comely, and a scarf of blue satin upon him, and a brooch of gold</a>
<a id='line_5639'>in the scarf upon his right shoulder as large as a warrior’s middle</a>
<a id='line_5640'>finger.  And upon his feet were hose of fine Totness, and shoes of</a>
<a id='line_5641'>parti-coloured leather, clasped with gold, and the youth was of noble</a>
<a id='line_5642'>bearing, fair of face, with ruddy cheeks and large hawk’s eyes.  In the</a>
<a id='line_5643'>hand of the youth was a mighty lance, speckled yellow, with a</a>
<a id='line_5644'>newly-sharpened head; and upon the lance a banner displayed.</a>
<a id='line_5645'></a>
<a id='line_5646'>Fiercely angry, and with rapid pace, came the youth to the place where</a>
<a id='line_5647'>Arthur was playing at chess with Owain.  And they perceived that he was</a>
<a id='line_5648'>wroth.  And thereupon he saluted Owain, and told him that his Ravens had</a>
<a id='line_5649'>been killed, the chief part of them, and that such of them as were not</a>
<a id='line_5650'>slain were so wounded and bruised that not one of them could raise its</a>
<a id='line_5651'>wings a single fathom above the earth.  “Lord,” said Owain, “forbid thy</a>
<a id='line_5652'>men.”  “Play,” said he, “if it please thee.”  Then said Owain to the</a>
<a id='line_5653'>youth, “Go back, and wherever thou findest the strife at the thickest,</a>
<a id='line_5654'>there lift up the banner, and let come what pleases Heaven.”</a>
<a id='line_5655'></a>
<a id='line_5656'>So the youth returned back to the place where the strife bore hardest</a>
<a id='line_5657'>upon the Ravens, and he lifted up the banner; and as he did so they all</a>
<a id='line_5658'>rose up in the air, wrathful and fierce and high of spirit, clapping</a>
<a id='line_5659'>their wings in the wind, and shaking off the weariness that was upon</a>
<a id='line_5660'>them.  And recovering their energy and courage, furiously and with</a>
<a id='line_5661'>exultation did they, with one sweep, descend upon the heads of the men,</a>
<a id='line_5662'>who had erewhile caused them anger and pain and damage, and they seized</a>
<a id='line_5663'>some by the heads and others by the eyes, and some by the ears, and</a>
<a id='line_5664'>others by the arms, and carried them up into the air; and in the air</a>
<a id='line_5665'>there was a mighty tumult with the flapping of the wings of the</a>
<a id='line_5666'>triumphant Ravens, and with their croaking; and there was another mighty</a>
<a id='line_5667'>tumult with the groaning of the men, that were being torn and wounded,</a>
<a id='line_5668'>and some of whom were slain.</a>
<a id='line_5669'></a>
<a id='line_5670'>And Arthur and Owain marvelled at the tumult as they played at chess;</a>
<a id='line_5671'>and, looking, they perceived a knight upon a dun-coloured horse coming</a>
<a id='line_5672'>towards them.  And marvellous was the hue of the dun horse.  Bright red</a>
<a id='line_5673'>was his right shoulder, and from the top of his legs to the centre of his</a>
<a id='line_5674'>hoof was bright yellow.  Both the knight and his horse were fully</a>
<a id='line_5675'>equipped with heavy foreign armour.  The clothing of the horse from the</a>
<a id='line_5676'>front opening upwards was of bright red sendal, and from thence opening</a>
<a id='line_5677'>downwards was of bright yellow sendal.  A large gold-hilted one-edged</a>
<a id='line_5678'>sword had the youth upon his thigh, in a scabbard of light blue, and</a>
<a id='line_5679'>tipped with Spanish laton.  The belt of the sword was of dark green</a>
<a id='line_5680'>leather with golden slides and a clasp of ivory upon it, and a buckle of</a>
<a id='line_5681'>jet-black upon the clasp.  A helmet of gold was on the head of the</a>
<a id='line_5682'>knight, set with precious stones of great virtue, and at the top of the</a>
<a id='line_5683'>helmet was the image of a flame-coloured leopard with two ruby-red stones</a>
<a id='line_5684'>in its head, so that it was astounding for a warrior, however stout his</a>
<a id='line_5685'>heart, to look at the face of the leopard, much more at the face of the</a>
<a id='line_5686'>knight.  He had in his hand a blue-shafted lance, but from the haft to</a>
<a id='line_5687'>the point it was stained crimson-red with the blood of the Ravens and</a>
<a id='line_5688'>their plumage.</a>
<a id='line_5689'></a>
<a id='line_5690'>The knight came to the place where Arthur and Owain were seated at chess.</a>
<a id='line_5691'>And they perceived that he was harassed and vexed and weary as he came</a>
<a id='line_5692'>towards them.  And the youth saluted Arthur, and told him that the Ravens</a>
<a id='line_5693'>of Owain were slaying his young men and attendants.  And Arthur looked at</a>
<a id='line_5694'>Owain and said, “Forbid thy Ravens.”  “Lord,” answered Owain, “play thy</a>
<a id='line_5695'>game.”  And they played.  And the knight returned back towards the</a>
<a id='line_5696'>strife, and the Ravens were not forbidden any more than before.</a>
<a id='line_5697'></a>
<a id='line_5698'>And when they had played awhile, they heard a mighty tumult, and a</a>
<a id='line_5699'>wailing of men, and a croaking of Ravens, as they carried the men in</a>
<a id='line_5700'>their strength into the air, and, tearing them betwixt them, let them</a>
<a id='line_5701'>fall piecemeal to the earth.  And during the tumult they saw a knight</a>
<a id='line_5702'>coming towards them, on a light grey horse, and the left foreleg of the</a>
<a id='line_5703'>horse was jet-black to the centre of his hoof.  And the knight and the</a>
<a id='line_5704'>horse were fully accoutred with huge heavy blue armour.  And a robe of</a>
<a id='line_5705'>honour of yellow diapered satin was upon the knight, and the borders of</a>
<a id='line_5706'>the robe were blue.  And the housings of the horse were jet-black, with</a>
<a id='line_5707'>borders of bright yellow.  And on the thigh of the youth was a sword,</a>
<a id='line_5708'>long, and three-edged, and heavy.  And the scabbard was of red cut</a>
<a id='line_5709'>leather, and the belt of new red deer-skin, having upon it many golden</a>
<a id='line_5710'>slides and a buckle of the bone of the sea-horse, the tongue of which was</a>
<a id='line_5711'>jet-black.  A golden helmet was upon the head of the knight, wherein were</a>
<a id='line_5712'>set sapphire-stones of great virtue.  And at the top of the helmet was</a>
<a id='line_5713'>the figure of a flame-coloured lion, with a fiery-red tongue, issuing</a>
<a id='line_5714'>above a foot from his mouth, and with venomous eyes, crimson-red, in his</a>
<a id='line_5715'>head.  And the knight came, bearing in his hand a thick ashen lance, the</a>
<a id='line_5716'>head whereof, which had been newly steeped in blood, was overlaid with</a>
<a id='line_5717'>silver.</a>
<a id='line_5718'></a>
<a id='line_5719'>And the youth saluted the Emperor: “Lord,” said he, “carest thou not for</a>
<a id='line_5720'>the slaying of thy pages, and thy young men, and the sons of the nobles</a>
<a id='line_5721'>of the Island of Britain, whereby it will be difficult to defend this</a>
<a id='line_5722'>island from henceforward for ever?”  “Owain,” said Arthur, “forbid thy</a>
<a id='line_5723'>Ravens.”  “Play this game, Lord,” said Owain.</a>
<a id='line_5724'></a>
<a id='line_5725'>So they finished the game and began another; and as they were finishing</a>
<a id='line_5726'>that game, lo, they heard a great tumult and a clamour of armed men, and</a>
<a id='line_5727'>a croaking of Ravens, and a flapping of wings in the air, as they flung</a>
<a id='line_5728'>down the armour entire to the ground, and the men and the horses</a>
<a id='line_5729'>piecemeal.  Then they saw coming a knight on a lofty-headed piebald</a>
<a id='line_5730'>horse.  And the left shoulder of the horse was of bright red, and its</a>
<a id='line_5731'>right leg from the chest to the hollow of the hoof was pure white.  And</a>
<a id='line_5732'>the knight and horse were equipped with arms of speckled yellow,</a>
<a id='line_5733'>variegated with Spanish laton.  And there was a robe of honour upon him,</a>
<a id='line_5734'>and upon his horse, divided in two parts, white and black, and the</a>
<a id='line_5735'>borders of the robe of honour were of golden purple.  And above the robe</a>
<a id='line_5736'>he wore a sword three-edged and bright, with a golden hilt.  And the belt</a>
<a id='line_5737'>of the sword was of yellow goldwork, having a clasp upon it of the eyelid</a>
<a id='line_5738'>of a black sea-horse, and a tongue of yellow gold to the clasp.  Upon the</a>
<a id='line_5739'>head of the knight was a bright helmet of yellow laton, with sparkling</a>
<a id='line_5740'>stones of crystal in it, and at the crest of the helmet was the figure of</a>
<a id='line_5741'>a griffin, with a stone of many virtues in its head.  And he had an ashen</a>
<a id='line_5742'>spear in his hand, with a round shaft, coloured with azure blue.  And the</a>
<a id='line_5743'>head of the spear was newly stained with blood, and was overlaid with</a>
<a id='line_5744'>fine silver.</a>
<a id='line_5745'></a>
<a id='line_5746'>Wrathfully came the knight to the place where Arthur was, and he told him</a>
<a id='line_5747'>that the Ravens had slain his household and the sons of the chief men of</a>
<a id='line_5748'>this island, and he besought him to cause Owain to forbid his Ravens.</a>
<a id='line_5749'>And Arthur besought Owain to forbid them.  Then Arthur took the golden</a>
<a id='line_5750'>chessmen that were upon the board, and crushed them until they became as</a>
<a id='line_5751'>dust.  Then Owain ordered Gwres the son of Rheged to lower his banner.</a>
<a id='line_5752'>So it was lowered, and all was peace.</a>
<a id='line_5753'></a>
<a id='line_5754'>Then Rhonabwy inquired of Iddawc who were the first three men that came</a>
<a id='line_5755'>to Owain, to tell him his Ravens were being slain.  Said Iddawc, “They</a>
<a id='line_5756'>were men who grieved that Owain should suffer loss, his fellow-chieftains</a>
<a id='line_5757'>and companions, Selyv the son of Kynan Garwyn of Powys, and Gwgawn</a>
<a id='line_5758'>Gleddyvrudd, and Gwres the son of Rheged, he who bears the banner in the</a>
<a id='line_5759'>day of battle and strife.”  “Who,” said Rhonabwy, “were the last three</a>
<a id='line_5760'>men who came to Arthur, and told him that the Ravens were slaughtering</a>
<a id='line_5761'>his men?”  “The best of men,” said Iddawc, “and the bravest, and who</a>
<a id='line_5762'>would grieve exceedingly that Arthur should have damage in aught;</a>
<a id='line_5763'>Blathaon the son of Mawrheth, and Rhuvawn Pebyr the son of Prince</a>
<a id='line_5764'>Deorthach, and Hyveidd Unllenn.”</a>
<a id='line_5765'></a>
<a id='line_5766'>And with that behold four-and-twenty knights came from Osla Gyllellvawr,</a>
<a id='line_5767'>to crave a truce of Arthur for a fortnight and a month.  And Arthur rose</a>
<a id='line_5768'>and went to take counsel.  And he came to where a tall, auburn,</a>
<a id='line_5769'>curly-headed man was a little way off, and there he assembled his</a>
<a id='line_5770'>counsellors.  Bedwini, the Bishop, and Gwarthegyd the son of Kaw, and</a>
<a id='line_5771'>March the son of Meirchawn, and Caradawc Vreichvras, and Gwalchmai the</a>
<a id='line_5772'>son of Gwyar, and Edeyrn the son of Nudd, and Rhuvawn Pebyr the son of</a>
<a id='line_5773'>Prince Deorthach, and Rhiogan the son of the King of Ireland, and</a>
<a id='line_5774'>Gwenwynwyn the son of Nav, Howel the son of Emyr Llydaw, Gwilym the son</a>
<a id='line_5775'>of Rhwyf Freinc, and Daned the son of Ath, and Goreu Custennin, and Mabon</a>
<a id='line_5776'>the son of Modron, and Peredur Paladyr Hir, and Hyveidd Unllenn, and</a>
<a id='line_5777'>Twrch the son of Perif, and Nerth the son of Kadarn, and Gobrwy the son</a>
<a id='line_5778'>of Echel Vorddwyttwll, Gwair the son of Gwestyl, and Gadwy the son of</a>
<a id='line_5779'>Geraint, Trystan the son of Tallwch, Moryen Manawc, Granwen the son of</a>
<a id='line_5780'>Llyr, and Llacheu the son of Arthur, and Llawvrodedd Varvawc, and Kadwr</a>
<a id='line_5781'>Earl of Cornwall, Morvran the son of Tegid, and Rhyawd the son of</a>
<a id='line_5782'>Morgant, and Dyvyr the son of Alun Dyved, Gwrhyr Gwalstawd Ieithoedd,</a>
<a id='line_5783'>Adaon the son of Taliesin, Llary the son of Kasnar Wledig, and Fflewddur</a>
<a id='line_5784'>Fflam, and Greidawl Galldovydd, Gilbert the son of Kadgyffro, Menw the</a>
<a id='line_5785'>son of Teirgwaedd, Gwrthmwl Wledig, Cawrdav the son of Caradawc</a>
<a id='line_5786'>Vreichvras, Gildas the son of Kaw, Kadyriaith the son of Saidi, and many</a>
<a id='line_5787'>of the men of Norway and Denmark, and many of the men of Greece, and a</a>
<a id='line_5788'>crowd of the men of the host came to that council.</a>
<a id='line_5789'></a>
<a id='line_5790'>“Iddawc,” said Rhonabwy, “who was the auburn haired man to whom they came</a>
<a id='line_5791'>just now?”  “Rhun the son of Maelgwn Gwynedd, a man whose prerogative it</a>
<a id='line_5792'>is, that he may join in counsel with all.”  “And wherefore did they admit</a>
<a id='line_5793'>into counsel with men of such dignity as are yonder a stripling so young</a>
<a id='line_5794'>as Kadyriaith the son of Saidi?”  “Because there is not throughout</a>
<a id='line_5795'>Britain a man better skilled in counsel than he.”</a>
<a id='line_5796'></a>
<a id='line_5797'>Thereupon, behold, bards came and recited verses before Arthur, and no</a>
<a id='line_5798'>man understood those verses but Kadyriaith only, save that they were in</a>
<a id='line_5799'>Arthur’s praise.</a>
<a id='line_5800'></a>
<a id='line_5801'>And lo, there came four-and-twenty asses with their burdens of gold and</a>
<a id='line_5802'>of silver, and a tired way-worn man with each of them, bringing tribute</a>
<a id='line_5803'>to Arthur from the Islands of Greece.  Then Kadyriaith the son of Saidi</a>
<a id='line_5804'>besought that a truce might be granted to Osla Gyllellvawr for the space</a>
<a id='line_5805'>of a fortnight and a month, and that the asses and the burdens they</a>
<a id='line_5806'>carried might be given to the bards, to be to them as the reward for</a>
<a id='line_5807'>their stay and that their verse might be recompensed during the time of</a>
<a id='line_5808'>the truce.  And thus it was settled.</a>
<a id='line_5809'></a>
<a id='line_5810'>“Rhonabwy,” said Iddawc, “would it not be wrong to forbid a youth who can</a>
<a id='line_5811'>give counsel so liberal as this from coming to the councils of his Lord?”</a>
<a id='line_5812'></a>
<a id='line_5813'>Then Kai arose, and he said, “Whosoever will follow Arthur, let him be</a>
<a id='line_5814'>with him to-night in Cornwall, and whosoever will not, let him be opposed</a>
<a id='line_5815'>to Arthur even during the truce.”  And through the greatness of the</a>
<a id='line_5816'>tumult that ensued, Rhonabwy awoke.  And when he awoke he was upon the</a>
<a id='line_5817'>yellow calf-skin, having slept three nights and three days.</a>
<a id='line_5818'></a>
<a id='line_5819'>And this tale is called the Dream of Rhonabwy.  And this is the reason</a>
<a id='line_5820'>that no one knows the dream without a book, neither bard nor gifted seer;</a>
<a id='line_5821'>because of the various colours that were upon the horses, and the many</a>
<a id='line_5822'>wondrous colours of the arms and of the panoply, and of the precious</a>
<a id='line_5823'>scarfs, and of the virtue-bearing stones.</a>
<a id='line_5824'></a>
<a id='line_5825'></a>
<a id='line_5826'></a>
<a id='line_5827'></a>
<a id='line_5828'>PWYLL PRINCE OF DYVED</a>
<a id='line_5829'></a>
<a id='line_5830'></a>
<a id='line_5831'>PWYLL PRINCE OF DYVED was lord of the seven Cantrevs of Dyved; and once</a>
<a id='line_5832'>upon a time he was at Narberth his chief palace, and he was minded to go</a>
<a id='line_5833'>and hunt, and the part of his dominions in which it pleased him to hunt</a>
<a id='line_5834'>was Glyn Cuch.  So he set forth from Narbeth that night, and went as far</a>
<a id='line_5835'>as Llwyn Diarwyd.  And that night he tarried there, and early on the</a>
<a id='line_5836'>morrow he rose and came to Glyn Cuch, when he let loose the dogs in the</a>
<a id='line_5837'>wood, and sounded the horn, and began the chase.  And as he followed the</a>
<a id='line_5838'>dogs, he lost his companions; and whilst he listened to the hounds, he</a>
<a id='line_5839'>heard the cry of other hounds, a cry different from his own, and coming</a>
<a id='line_5840'>in the opposite direction.</a>
<a id='line_5841'></a>
<a id='line_5842'>And he beheld a glade in the wood forming a level plain, and as his dogs</a>
<a id='line_5843'>came to the edge of the glade, he saw a stag before the other dogs.  And</a>
<a id='line_5844'>lo, as it reached the middle of the glade, the dogs that followed the</a>
<a id='line_5845'>stag overtook it and brought it down.  Then looked he at the colour of</a>
<a id='line_5846'>the dogs, staying not to look at the stag, and of all the hounds that he</a>
<a id='line_5847'>had seen in the world, he had never seen any that were like unto these.</a>
<a id='line_5848'>For their hair was of a brilliant shining white, and their ears were red;</a>
<a id='line_5849'>and as the whiteness of their bodies shone, so did the redness of their</a>
<a id='line_5850'>ears glisten.  And he came towards the dogs, and drove away those that</a>
<a id='line_5851'>had brought down the stag, and set his own dogs upon it.</a>
<a id='line_5852'></a>
<a id='line_5853'>And as he was setting on his dogs he saw a horseman coming towards him</a>
<a id='line_5854'>upon a large light-grey steed, with a hunting horn round his neck, and</a>
<a id='line_5855'>clad in garments of grey woollen in the fashion of a hunting garb.  And</a>
<a id='line_5856'>the horseman drew near and spoke unto him thus.  “Chieftain,” said he, “I</a>
<a id='line_5857'>know who thou art, and I greet thee not.”  “Peradventure,” said Pwyll,</a>
<a id='line_5858'>“thou art of such dignity that thou shouldest not do so.”  “Verily,”</a>
<a id='line_5859'>answered he, “it is not my dignity that prevents me.”  “What is it then,</a>
<a id='line_5860'>O Chieftain?” asked he.  “By Heaven, it is by reason of thine own</a>
<a id='line_5861'>ignorance and want of courtesy.”  “What discourtesy, Chieftain, hast thou</a>
<a id='line_5862'>seen in me?”  “Greater discourtesy saw I never in man,” said he, “than to</a>
<a id='line_5863'>drive away the dogs that were killing the stag and to set upon it thine</a>
<a id='line_5864'>own.  This was discourteous, and though I may not be revenged upon thee,</a>
<a id='line_5865'>yet I declare to Heaven that I will do thee more dishonour than the value</a>
<a id='line_5866'>of an hundred stags.”  “O Chieftain,” he replied, “if I have done ill I</a>
<a id='line_5867'>will redeem thy friendship.”  “How wilt thou redeem it?”  “According as</a>
<a id='line_5868'>thy dignity may be, but I know not who thou art?”  “A crowned king am I</a>
<a id='line_5869'>in the land whence I come.”  “Lord,” said he, “may the day prosper with</a>
<a id='line_5870'>thee, and from what land comest thou?”  “From Annwvyn,” {2} answered he;</a>
<a id='line_5871'>“Arawn, a King of Annwvyn, am I.”  “Lord,” said he, “how may I gain thy</a>
<a id='line_5872'>friendship?”  “After this manner mayest thou,” he said.  “There is a man</a>
<a id='line_5873'>whose dominions are opposite to mine, who is ever warring against me, and</a>
<a id='line_5874'>he is Havgan, a King of Annwvyn, and by ridding me of this oppression,</a>
<a id='line_5875'>which thou canst easily do, shalt thou gain my friendship.”  “Gladly will</a>
<a id='line_5876'>I do this,” said he.  “Show me how I may.”  “I will show thee.  Behold</a>
<a id='line_5877'>thus it is thou mayest.  I will make firm friendship with thee; and this</a>
<a id='line_5878'>will I do.  I will send thee to Annwvyn in my stead, and I will give thee</a>
<a id='line_5879'>the fairest lady thou didst ever behold to be thy companion, and I will</a>
<a id='line_5880'>put my form and semblance upon thee, so that not a page of the chamber,</a>
<a id='line_5881'>nor an officer, nor any other man that has always followed me shall know</a>
<a id='line_5882'>that it is not I.  And this shall be for the space of a year from</a>
<a id='line_5883'>to-morrow, and then we will meet in this place.”  “Yes,” said he; “but</a>
<a id='line_5884'>when I shall have been there for the space of a year, by what means shall</a>
<a id='line_5885'>I discover him of whom thou speakest?”  “One year from this night,” he</a>
<a id='line_5886'>answered, “is the time fixed between him and me that we should meet at</a>
<a id='line_5887'>the Ford; be thou there in my likeness, and with one stroke that thou</a>
<a id='line_5888'>givest him, he shall no longer live.  And if he ask thee to give him</a>
<a id='line_5889'>another, give it not, how much soever he may entreat thee, for when I did</a>
<a id='line_5890'>so, he fought with me next day as well as ever before.”  “Verily,” said</a>
<a id='line_5891'>Pwyll, “what shall I do concerning my kingdom?”  Said Arawn, “I will</a>
<a id='line_5892'>cause that no one in all thy dominions, neither man nor woman, shall know</a>
<a id='line_5893'>that I am not thou, and I will go there in thy stead.”  “Gladly then,”</a>
<a id='line_5894'>said Pwyll, “will I set forward.”  “Clear shall be thy path, and nothing</a>
<a id='line_5895'>shall detain thee, until thou come into my dominions, and I myself will</a>
<a id='line_5896'>be thy guide!”</a>
<a id='line_5897'></a>
<a id='line_5898'>So he conducted him until he came in sight of the palace and its</a>
<a id='line_5899'>dwellings.  “Behold,” said he, “the Court and the kingdom in thy power.</a>
<a id='line_5900'>Enter the Court, there is no one there who will know thee, and when thou</a>
<a id='line_5901'>seest what service is done there, thou wilt know the customs of the</a>
<a id='line_5902'>Court.”</a>
<a id='line_5903'></a>
<a id='line_5904'>So he went forward to the Court, and when he came there, he beheld</a>
<a id='line_5905'>sleeping-rooms, and halls, and chambers, and the most beautiful buildings</a>
<a id='line_5906'>ever seen.  And he went into the hall to disarray, and there came youths</a>
<a id='line_5907'>and pages and disarrayed him, and all as they entered saluted him.  And</a>
<a id='line_5908'>two knights came and drew his hunting-dress from about him, and clothed</a>
<a id='line_5909'>him in a vesture of silk and gold.  And the hall was prepared, and behold</a>
<a id='line_5910'>he saw the household and the host enter in, and the host was the most</a>
<a id='line_5911'>comely and the best equipped that he had ever seen.  And with them came</a>
<a id='line_5912'>in likewise the Queen, who was the fairest woman that he had ever yet</a>
<a id='line_5913'>beheld.  And she had on a yellow robe of shining satin; and they washed</a>
<a id='line_5914'>and went to the table, and sat, the Queen upon one side of him, and one</a>
<a id='line_5915'>who seemed to be an Earl on the other side.</a>
<a id='line_5916'></a>
<a id='line_5917'>And he began to speak with the Queen, and he thought, from her speech,</a>
<a id='line_5918'>that she was the seemliest and most noble lady of converse and of cheer</a>
<a id='line_5919'>that ever was.  And they partook of meat, and drink, with songs and with</a>
<a id='line_5920'>feasting; and of all the Courts upon the earth, behold this was the best</a>
<a id='line_5921'>supplied with food and drink, and vessels of gold and royal jewels.</a>
<a id='line_5922'></a>
<a id='line_5923'>                                * * * * *</a>
<a id='line_5924'></a>
<a id='line_5925'>And the year he spent in hunting, and minstrelsy, and feasting, and</a>
<a id='line_5926'>diversions, and discourse with his companions until the night that was</a>
<a id='line_5927'>fixed for the conflict.  And when that night came, it was remembered even</a>
<a id='line_5928'>by those who lived in the furthest part of his dominions, and he went to</a>
<a id='line_5929'>the meeting, and the nobles of the kingdom with him.  And when he came to</a>
<a id='line_5930'>the Ford, a knight arose and spake thus.  “Lords,” said he, “listen well.</a>
<a id='line_5931'>It is between two kings that this meeting is, and between them only.</a>
<a id='line_5932'>Each claimeth of the other his land and territory, and do all of you</a>
<a id='line_5933'>stand aside and leave the fight to be between them.”</a>
<a id='line_5934'></a>
<a id='line_5935'>Thereupon the two kings approached each other in the middle of the Ford,</a>
<a id='line_5936'>and encountered, and at the first thrust, the man who was in the stead of</a>
<a id='line_5937'>Arawn struck Havgan on the centre of the boss of his shield, so that it</a>
<a id='line_5938'>was cloven in twain, and his armour was broken, and Havgan himself was</a>
<a id='line_5939'>borne to the ground an arm’s and a spear’s length over the crupper of his</a>
<a id='line_5940'>horse, and he received a deadly blow.  “O Chieftain,” said Havgan, “what</a>
<a id='line_5941'>right hast thou to cause my death?  I was not injuring thee in anything,</a>
<a id='line_5942'>and I know not wherefore thou wouldest slay me.  But, for the love of</a>
<a id='line_5943'>Heaven, since thou hast begun to slay me, complete thy work.”  “Ah,</a>
<a id='line_5944'>Chieftain,” he replied, “I may yet repent doing that unto thee, slay thee</a>
<a id='line_5945'>who may, I will not do so.”  “My trusty Lords,” said Havgan, “bear me</a>
<a id='line_5946'>hence.  My death has come.  I shall be no more able to uphold you.”  “My</a>
<a id='line_5947'>Nobles,” also said he who was in the semblance of Arawn, “take counsel</a>
<a id='line_5948'>and know who ought to be my subjects.”  “Lord,” said the Nobles, “all</a>
<a id='line_5949'>should be, for there is no king over the whole of Annwvyn but thee.”</a>
<a id='line_5950'>“Yes,” he replied, “it is right that he who comes humbly should be</a>
<a id='line_5951'>received graciously, but he that doth not come with obedience, shall be</a>
<a id='line_5952'>compelled by the force of swords.”  And thereupon he received the homage</a>
<a id='line_5953'>of the men, and he began to conquer the country; and the next day by noon</a>
<a id='line_5954'>the two kingdoms were in his power.  And thereupon he went to keep his</a>
<a id='line_5955'>tryst, and came to Glyn Cuch.</a>
<a id='line_5956'></a>
<a id='line_5957'>And when he came there, the King of Annwvyn was there to meet him, and</a>
<a id='line_5958'>each of them was rejoiced to see the other.  “Verily,” said Arawn, “may</a>
<a id='line_5959'>Heaven reward thee for thy friendship towards me.  I have heard of it.</a>
<a id='line_5960'>When thou comest thyself to thy dominions,” said he, “thou wilt see that</a>
<a id='line_5961'>which I have done for thee.”  “Whatever thou hast done for me, may Heaven</a>
<a id='line_5962'>repay it thee.”</a>
<a id='line_5963'></a>
<a id='line_5964'>Then Arawn gave to Pwyll Prince of Dyved his proper form and semblance,</a>
<a id='line_5965'>and he himself took his own; and Arawn set forth towards the Court of</a>
<a id='line_5966'>Annwvyn; and he was rejoiced when he beheld his hosts, and his household,</a>
<a id='line_5967'>whom he had not seen so long; but they had not known of his absence, and</a>
<a id='line_5968'>wondered no more at his coming than usual.  And that day was spent in joy</a>
<a id='line_5969'>and merriment; and he sat and conversed with his wife and his nobles.</a>
<a id='line_5970'>And when it was time for them rather to sleep than to carouse, they went</a>
<a id='line_5971'>to rest.</a>
<a id='line_5972'></a>
<a id='line_5973'>                                * * * * *</a>
<a id='line_5974'></a>
<a id='line_5975'>Pwyll Prince of Dyved came likewise to his country and dominions, and</a>
<a id='line_5976'>began to inquire of the nobles of the land, how his rule had been during</a>
<a id='line_5977'>the past year, compared with what it had been before.  “Lord,” said they,</a>
<a id='line_5978'>“thy wisdom was never so great, and thou wast never so kind or so free in</a>
<a id='line_5979'>bestowing thy gifts, and thy justice was never more worthily seen than in</a>
<a id='line_5980'>this year.”  “By Heaven,” said he, “for all the good you have enjoyed,</a>
<a id='line_5981'>you should thank him who hath been with you; for behold, thus hath this</a>
<a id='line_5982'>matter been.”  And thereupon Pwyll related the whole unto them.  “Verily,</a>
<a id='line_5983'>Lord,” said they, “render thanks unto Heaven that thou hast such a</a>
<a id='line_5984'>fellowship, and withhold not from us the rule which we have enjoyed for</a>
<a id='line_5985'>this year past.”  “I take Heaven to witness that I will not withhold it,”</a>
<a id='line_5986'>answered Pwyll.</a>
<a id='line_5987'></a>
<a id='line_5988'>And thenceforth they made strong the friendship that was between them,</a>
<a id='line_5989'>and each sent unto the other horses, and greyhounds, and hawks, and all</a>
<a id='line_5990'>such jewels as they thought would be pleasing to each other.  And by</a>
<a id='line_5991'>reason of his having dwelt that year in Annwvyn, and having ruled there</a>
<a id='line_5992'>so prosperously, and united the two kingdoms in one day by his valour and</a>
<a id='line_5993'>prowess, he lost the name of Pwyll Prince of Dyved, and was called Pwyll</a>
<a id='line_5994'>Chief of Annwvyn from that time forward.</a>
<a id='line_5995'></a>
<a id='line_5996'>                                * * * * *</a>
<a id='line_5997'></a>
<a id='line_5998'>Once upon a time, Pwyll was at Narberth his chief palace, where a feast</a>
<a id='line_5999'>had been prepared for him, and with him was a great host of men.  And</a>
<a id='line_6000'>after the first meal, Pwyll arose to walk, and he went to the top of a</a>
<a id='line_6001'>mound that was above the palace, and was called Gorsedd Arberth.  “Lord,”</a>
<a id='line_6002'>said one of the Court, “it is peculiar to the mound that whosoever sits</a>
<a id='line_6003'>upon it cannot go thence, without either receiving wounds or blows, or</a>
<a id='line_6004'>else seeing a wonder.”  “I fear not to receive wounds and blows in the</a>
<a id='line_6005'>midst of such a host as this, but as to the wonder, gladly would I see</a>
<a id='line_6006'>it.  I will go therefore and sit upon the mound.”</a>
<a id='line_6007'></a>
<a id='line_6008'>And upon the mound he sat.  And while he sat there, they saw a lady, on a</a>
<a id='line_6009'>pure white horse of large size, with a garment of shining gold around</a>
<a id='line_6010'>her, coming along the highway that led from the mound; and the horse</a>
<a id='line_6011'>seemed to move at a slow and even pace, and to be coming up towards the</a>
<a id='line_6012'>mound.  “My men,” said Pwyll, “is there any among you who knows yonder</a>
<a id='line_6013'>lady?”  “There is not, Lord,” said they.  “Go one of you and meet her,</a>
<a id='line_6014'>that we may know who she is.”  And one of them arose, and as he came upon</a>
<a id='line_6015'>the road to meet her, she passed by, and he followed as fast as he could,</a>
<a id='line_6016'>being on foot; and the greater was his speed, the further was she from</a>
<a id='line_6017'>him.  And when he saw that it profited him nothing to follow her, he</a>
<a id='line_6018'>returned to Pwyll, and said unto him, “Lord, it is idle for any one in</a>
<a id='line_6019'>the world to follow her on foot.”  “Verily,” said Pwyll, “go unto the</a>
<a id='line_6020'>palace, and take the fleetest horse that thou seest, and go after her.”</a>
<a id='line_6021'></a>
<a id='line_6022'>And he took a horse and went forward.  And he came to an open level</a>
<a id='line_6023'>plain, and put spurs to his horse; and the more he urged his horse, the</a>
<a id='line_6024'>further was she from him.  Yet she held the same pace as at first.  And</a>
<a id='line_6025'>his horse began to fail; and when his horse’s feet failed him, he</a>
<a id='line_6026'>returned to the place where Pwyll was.  “Lord,” said he, “it will avail</a>
<a id='line_6027'>nothing for any one to follow yonder lady.  I know of no horse in these</a>
<a id='line_6028'>realms swifter than this, and it availed me not to pursue her.”  “Of a</a>
<a id='line_6029'>truth,” said Pwyll, “there must be some illusion here.  Let us go towards</a>
<a id='line_6030'>the palace.”  So to the palace they went, and they spent that day.  And</a>
<a id='line_6031'>the next day they arose, and that also they spent until it was time to go</a>
<a id='line_6032'>to meat.  And after the first meal, “Verily,” said Pwyll, “we will go the</a>
<a id='line_6033'>same party as yesterday to the top of the mound.  And do thou,” said he</a>
<a id='line_6034'>to one of his young men, “take the swiftest horse that thou knowest in</a>
<a id='line_6035'>the field.”  And thus did the young man.  And they went towards the</a>
<a id='line_6036'>mound, taking the horse with them.  And as they were sitting down they</a>
<a id='line_6037'>beheld the lady on the same horse, and in the same apparel, coming along</a>
<a id='line_6038'>the same road.  “Behold,” said Pwyll, “here is the lady of yesterday.</a>
<a id='line_6039'>Make ready, youth, to learn who she is.”  “My lord,” said he, “that will</a>
<a id='line_6040'>I gladly do.”  And thereupon the lady came opposite to them.  So the</a>
<a id='line_6041'>youth mounted his horse; and before he had settled himself in his saddle,</a>
<a id='line_6042'>she passed by, and there was a clear space between them.  But her speed</a>
<a id='line_6043'>was no greater than it had been the day before.  Then he put his horse</a>
<a id='line_6044'>into an amble, and thought that notwithstanding the gentle pace at which</a>
<a id='line_6045'>his horse went, he should soon overtake her.  But this availed him not;</a>
<a id='line_6046'>so he gave his horse the reins.  And still he came no nearer to her than</a>
<a id='line_6047'>when he went at a foot’s pace.  And the more he urged his horse, the</a>
<a id='line_6048'>further was she from him.  Yet she rode not faster than before.  When he</a>
<a id='line_6049'>saw that it availed not to follow her, he returned to the place where</a>
<a id='line_6050'>Pwyll was.  “Lord,” said he, “the horse can no more than thou hast seen.”</a>
<a id='line_6051'>“I see indeed that it avails not that any one should follow her.  And by</a>
<a id='line_6052'>Heaven,” said he, “she must needs have an errand to some one in this</a>
<a id='line_6053'>plain, if her haste would allow her to declare it.  Let us go back to the</a>
<a id='line_6054'>palace.”  And to the palace they went, and they spent that night in songs</a>
<a id='line_6055'>and feasting, as it pleased them.</a>
<a id='line_6056'></a>
<a id='line_6057'>And the next day they amused themselves until it was time to go to meat.</a>
<a id='line_6058'>And when meat was ended, Pwyll said, “Where are the hosts that went</a>
<a id='line_6059'>yesterday and the day before to the top of the mound?”  “Behold, Lord, we</a>
<a id='line_6060'>are here,” said they.  “Let us go,” said he, “to the mound, to sit there.</a>
<a id='line_6061'>And do thou,” said he to the page who tended his horse, “saddle my horse</a>
<a id='line_6062'>well, and hasten with him to the road, and bring also my spurs with</a>
<a id='line_6063'>thee.”  And the youth did thus.  And they went and sat upon the mound;</a>
<a id='line_6064'>and ere they had been there but a short time, they beheld the lady coming</a>
<a id='line_6065'>by the same road, and in the same manner, and at the same pace.  “Young</a>
<a id='line_6066'>man,” said Pwyll, “I see the lady coming; give me my horse.”  And no</a>
<a id='line_6067'>sooner had he mounted his horse than she passed him.  And he turned after</a>
<a id='line_6068'>her and followed her.  And he let his horse go bounding playfully, and</a>
<a id='line_6069'>thought that at the second step or the third he should come up with her.</a>
<a id='line_6070'>But he came no nearer to her than at first.  Then he urged his horse to</a>
<a id='line_6071'>his utmost speed, yet he found that it availed nothing to follow her.</a>
<a id='line_6072'>Then said Pwyll, “O maiden, for the sake of him whom thou best lovest,</a>
<a id='line_6073'>stay for me.”  “I will stay gladly,” said she, “and it were better for</a>
<a id='line_6074'>thy horse hadst thou asked it long since.”  So the maiden stopped, and</a>
<a id='line_6075'>she threw back that part of her headdress which covered her face.  And</a>
<a id='line_6076'>she fixed her eyes upon him, and began to talk with him.  “Lady,” asked</a>
<a id='line_6077'>he, “whence comest thou, and whereunto dost thou journey?”  “I journey on</a>
<a id='line_6078'>mine own errand,” said she, “and right glad am I to see thee.”  “My</a>
<a id='line_6079'>greeting be unto thee,” said he.  Then he thought that the beauty of all</a>
<a id='line_6080'>the maidens, and all the ladies that he had ever seen, was as nothing</a>
<a id='line_6081'>compared to her beauty.  “Lady,” he said, “wilt thou tell me aught</a>
<a id='line_6082'>concerning thy purpose?”  “I will tell thee,” said she.  “My chief quest</a>
<a id='line_6083'>was to seek thee.”  “Behold,” said Pwyll, “this is to me the most</a>
<a id='line_6084'>pleasing quest on which thou couldst have come; and wilt thou tell me who</a>
<a id='line_6085'>thou art?”  “I will tell thee, Lord,” said she.  “I am Rhiannon, the</a>
<a id='line_6086'>daughter of Heveydd Hên, and they sought to give me to a husband against</a>
<a id='line_6087'>my will.  But no husband would I have, and that because of my love for</a>
<a id='line_6088'>thee, neither will I yet have one unless thou reject me.  And hither have</a>
<a id='line_6089'>I come to hear thy answer.”  “By Heaven,” said Pwyll, “behold this is my</a>
<a id='line_6090'>answer.  If I might choose among all the ladies and damsels in the world,</a>
<a id='line_6091'>thee would I choose.”  “Verily,” said she, “if thou art thus minded, make</a>
<a id='line_6092'>a pledge to meet me ere I am given to another.”  “The sooner I may do so,</a>
<a id='line_6093'>the more pleasing will it be unto me,” said Pwyll, “and wheresoever thou</a>
<a id='line_6094'>wilt, there will I meet with thee.”  “I will that thou meet me this day</a>
<a id='line_6095'>twelvemonth at the palace of Heveydd.  And I will cause a feast to be</a>
<a id='line_6096'>prepared, so that it be ready against thou come.”  “Gladly,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_6097'>“will I keep this tryst.”  “Lord,” said she, “remain in health, and be</a>
<a id='line_6098'>mindful that thou keep thy promise; and now I will go hence.”  So they</a>
<a id='line_6099'>parted, and he went back to his hosts and to them of his household.  And</a>
<a id='line_6100'>whatsoever questions they asked him respecting the damsel, he always</a>
<a id='line_6101'>turned the discourse upon other matters.  And when a year from that time</a>
<a id='line_6102'>was gone, he caused a hundred knights to equip themselves and to go with</a>
<a id='line_6103'>him to the palace of Heveydd Hên.  And he came to the palace, and there</a>
<a id='line_6104'>was great joy concerning him, with much concourse of people and great</a>
<a id='line_6105'>rejoicing, and vast preparations for his coming.  And the whole Court was</a>
<a id='line_6106'>placed under his orders.</a>
<a id='line_6107'></a>
<a id='line_6108'>And the hall was garnished and they went to meat, and thus did they sit;</a>
<a id='line_6109'>Heveydd Hên was on one side of Pwyll, and Rhiannon on the other.  And all</a>
<a id='line_6110'>the rest according to their rank.  And they ate and feasted and talked</a>
<a id='line_6111'>one with another, and at the beginning of the carousal after the meat,</a>
<a id='line_6112'>there entered a tall auburn-haired youth, of royal bearing, clothed in a</a>
<a id='line_6113'>garment of satin.  And when he came into the hall, he saluted Pwyll and</a>
<a id='line_6114'>his companions.  “The greeting of Heaven be unto thee, my soul,” said</a>
<a id='line_6115'>Pwyll, “come thou and sit down.”  “Nay,” said he, “a suitor am I, and I</a>
<a id='line_6116'>will do mine errand.”  “Do so willingly,” said Pwyll.  “Lord,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_6117'>“my errand is unto thee, and it is to crave a boon of thee that I come.”</a>
<a id='line_6118'>“What boon soever thou mayest ask of me, as far as I am able, thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_6119'>have.”  “Ah,” said Rhiannon, “wherefore didst thou give that answer?”</a>
<a id='line_6120'>“Has he not given it before the presence of these nobles?” asked the</a>
<a id='line_6121'>youth.  “My soul,” said Pwyll, “what is the boon thou askest?”  “The lady</a>
<a id='line_6122'>whom best I love is to be thy bride this night; I come to ask her of</a>
<a id='line_6123'>thee, with the feast and the banquet that are in this place.”  And Pwyll</a>
<a id='line_6124'>was silent because of the answer which he had given.  “Be silent as long</a>
<a id='line_6125'>as thou wilt,” said Rhiannon.  “Never did man make worse use of his wits</a>
<a id='line_6126'>than thou hast done.”  “Lady,” said he, “I knew not who he was.”  “Behold</a>
<a id='line_6127'>this is the man to whom they would have given me against my will,” said</a>
<a id='line_6128'>she.  “And he is Gwawl the son of Clud, a man of great power and wealth,</a>
<a id='line_6129'>and because of the word thou hast spoken, bestow me upon him lest shame</a>
<a id='line_6130'>befall thee.”  “Lady,” said he, “I understand not thine answer.  Never</a>
<a id='line_6131'>can I do as thou sayest.”  “Bestow me upon him,” said she, “and I will</a>
<a id='line_6132'>cause that I shall never be his.”  “By what means will that be?” asked</a>
<a id='line_6133'>Pwyll.  “In thy hand will I give thee a small bag,” said she.  “See that</a>
<a id='line_6134'>thou keep it well, and he will ask of thee the banquet, and the feast,</a>
<a id='line_6135'>and the preparations which are not in thy power.  Unto the hosts and the</a>
<a id='line_6136'>household will I give the feast.  And such will be thy answer respecting</a>
<a id='line_6137'>this.  And as concerns myself, I will engage to become his bride this</a>
<a id='line_6138'>night twelvemonth.  And at the end of the year be thou here,” said she,</a>
<a id='line_6139'>“and bring this bag with thee, and let thy hundred knights be in the</a>
<a id='line_6140'>orchard up yonder.  And when he is in the midst of joy and feasting, come</a>
<a id='line_6141'>thou in by thyself, clad in ragged garments, and holding thy bag in thy</a>
<a id='line_6142'>hand, and ask nothing but a bagful of food, and I will cause that if all</a>
<a id='line_6143'>the meat and liquor that are in these seven Cantrevs were put into it, it</a>
<a id='line_6144'>would be no fuller than before.  And after a great deal has been put</a>
<a id='line_6145'>therein, he will ask thee whether thy bag will ever be full.  Say thou</a>
<a id='line_6146'>then that it never will, until a man of noble birth and of great wealth</a>
<a id='line_6147'>arise and press the food in the bag with both his feet, saying, ‘Enough</a>
<a id='line_6148'>has been put therein;’ and I will cause him to go and tread down the food</a>
<a id='line_6149'>in the bag, and when he does so, turn thou the bag, so that he shall be</a>
<a id='line_6150'>up over his head in it, and then slip a knot upon the thongs of the bag.</a>
<a id='line_6151'>Let there be also a good bugle horn about thy neck, and as soon as thou</a>
<a id='line_6152'>hast bound him in the bag, wind thy horn, and let it be a signal between</a>
<a id='line_6153'>thee and thy knights.  And when they hear the sound of the horn, let them</a>
<a id='line_6154'>come down upon the palace.”  “Lord,” said Gwawl, “it is meet that I have</a>
<a id='line_6155'>an answer to my request.”  “As much of that thou hast asked as it is in</a>
<a id='line_6156'>my power to give, thou shalt have,” replied Pwyll.  “My soul,” said</a>
<a id='line_6157'>Rhiannon unto him, “as for the feast and the banquet that are here, I</a>
<a id='line_6158'>have bestowed them upon the men of Dyved, and the household, and the</a>
<a id='line_6159'>warriors that are with us.  These can I not suffer to be given to any.</a>
<a id='line_6160'>In a year from to-night a banquet shall be prepared for thee in this</a>
<a id='line_6161'>palace, that I may become thy bride.”</a>
<a id='line_6162'></a>
<a id='line_6163'>So Gwawl went forth to his possessions, and Pwyll went also back to</a>
<a id='line_6164'>Dyved.  And they both spent that year until it was the time for the feast</a>
<a id='line_6165'>at the palace of Heveydd Hên.  Then Gwawl the son of Clud set out to the</a>
<a id='line_6166'>feast that was prepared for him, and he came to the palace, and was</a>
<a id='line_6167'>received there with rejoicing.  Pwyll, also, the Chief of Annwvyn, came</a>
<a id='line_6168'>to the orchard with his hundred knights, as Rhiannon had commanded him,</a>
<a id='line_6169'>having the bag with him.  And Pwyll was clad in coarse and ragged</a>
<a id='line_6170'>garments, and wore large clumsy old shoes upon his feet.  And when he</a>
<a id='line_6171'>knew that the carousal after the meat had begun, he went towards the</a>
<a id='line_6172'>hall, and when he came into the hall, he saluted Gwawl the son of Clud,</a>
<a id='line_6173'>and his company, both men and women.  “Heaven prosper thee,” said Gwawl,</a>
<a id='line_6174'>“and the greeting of Heaven be unto thee.”  “Lord,” said he, “may Heaven</a>
<a id='line_6175'>reward thee, I have an errand unto thee.”  “Welcome be thine errand, and</a>
<a id='line_6176'>if thou ask of me that which is just, thou shalt have it gladly.”  “It is</a>
<a id='line_6177'>fitting,” answered he.  “I crave but from want, and the boon that I ask</a>
<a id='line_6178'>is to have this small bag that thou seest filled with meat.”  “A request</a>
<a id='line_6179'>within reason is this,” said he, “and gladly shalt thou have it.  Bring</a>
<a id='line_6180'>him food.”  A great number of attendants arose and began to fill the bag,</a>
<a id='line_6181'>but for all that they put into it, it was no fuller than at first.  “My</a>
<a id='line_6182'>soul,” said Gwawl, “will thy bag be ever full?”  “It will not, I declare</a>
<a id='line_6183'>to Heaven,” said he, “for all that may be put into it, unless one</a>
<a id='line_6184'>possessed of lands, and domains, and treasure, shall arise and tread down</a>
<a id='line_6185'>with both his feet the food that is within the bag, and shall say,</a>
<a id='line_6186'>‘Enough has been put therein.’”  Then said Rhiannon unto Gwawl the son of</a>
<a id='line_6187'>Clud, “Rise up quickly.”  “I will willingly arise,” said he.  So he rose</a>
<a id='line_6188'>up, and put his two feet into the bag.  And Pwyll turned up the sides of</a>
<a id='line_6189'>the bag, so that Gwawl was over his head in it.  And he shut it up</a>
<a id='line_6190'>quickly and slipped a knot upon the thongs, and blew his horn.  And</a>
<a id='line_6191'>thereupon behold his household came down upon the palace.  And they</a>
<a id='line_6192'>seized all the host that had come with Gwawl, and cast them into his own</a>
<a id='line_6193'>prison.  And Pwyll threw off his rags, and his old shoes, and his</a>
<a id='line_6194'>tattered array; and as they came in, every one of Pwyll’s knights struck</a>
<a id='line_6195'>a blow upon the bag, and asked, “What is here?”  “A Badger,” said they.</a>
<a id='line_6196'>And in this manner they played, each of them striking the bag, either</a>
<a id='line_6197'>with his foot or with a staff.  And thus played they with the bag.  Every</a>
<a id='line_6198'>one as he came in asked, “What game are you playing at thus?”  “The game</a>
<a id='line_6199'>of Badger in the Bag,” said they.  And then was the game of Badger in the</a>
<a id='line_6200'>Bag first played.</a>
<a id='line_6201'></a>
<a id='line_6202'>“Lord,” said the man in the bag, “if thou wouldest but hear me, I merit</a>
<a id='line_6203'>not to be slain in a bag.”  Said Heveydd Hên, “Lord, he speaks truth.  It</a>
<a id='line_6204'>were fitting that thou listen to him, for he deserves not this.”</a>
<a id='line_6205'>“Verily,” said Pwyll, “I will do thy counsel concerning him.”  “Behold</a>
<a id='line_6206'>this is my counsel then,” said Rhiannon; “thou art now in a position in</a>
<a id='line_6207'>which it behoves thee to satisfy suitors and minstrels; let him give unto</a>
<a id='line_6208'>them in thy stead, and take a pledge from him that he will never seek to</a>
<a id='line_6209'>revenge that which has been done to him.  And this will be punishment</a>
<a id='line_6210'>enough.”  “I will do this gladly,” said the man in the bag.  “And gladly</a>
<a id='line_6211'>will I accept it,” said Pwyll, “since it is the counsel of Heveydd and</a>
<a id='line_6212'>Rhiannon.”  “Such then is our counsel,” answered they.  “I accept it,”</a>
<a id='line_6213'>said Pwyll.  “Seek thyself sureties.”  “We will be for him,” said</a>
<a id='line_6214'>Heveydd, “until his men be free to answer for him.”  And upon this he was</a>
<a id='line_6215'>let out of the bag, and his liegemen were liberated.  “Demand now of</a>
<a id='line_6216'>Gwawl his sureties,” said Heveydd, “we know which should be taken for</a>
<a id='line_6217'>him.”  And Heveydd numbered the sureties.  Said Gwawl, “Do thou thyself</a>
<a id='line_6218'>draw up the covenant.”  “It will suffice me that it be as Rhiannon said,”</a>
<a id='line_6219'>answered Pwyll.  So unto that covenant were the sureties pledged.</a>
<a id='line_6220'>“Verily, Lord,” said Gwawl, “I am greatly hurt, and I have many bruises.</a>
<a id='line_6221'>I have need to be anointed; with thy leave I will go forth.  I will leave</a>
<a id='line_6222'>nobles in my stead, to answer for me in all that thou shalt require.”</a>
<a id='line_6223'>“Willingly,” said Pwyll, “mayest thou do thus.”  So Gwawl went towards</a>
<a id='line_6224'>his own possessions.</a>
<a id='line_6225'></a>
<a id='line_6226'>And the hall was set in order for Pwyll and the men of his host, and for</a>
<a id='line_6227'>them also of the palace, and they went to the tables and sat down.  And</a>
<a id='line_6228'>as they had sat that time twelvemonth, so sat they that night.  And they</a>
<a id='line_6229'>ate, and feasted, and spent the night in mirth and tranquillity.  And the</a>
<a id='line_6230'>time came that they should sleep, and Pwyll and Rhiannon went to their</a>
<a id='line_6231'>chamber.</a>
<a id='line_6232'></a>
<a id='line_6233'>And next morning at the break of day, “My Lord,” said Rhiannon, “arise</a>
<a id='line_6234'>and begin to give thy gifts unto the minstrels.  Refuse no one to-day</a>
<a id='line_6235'>that may claim thy bounty.”  “Thus shall it be gladly,” said Pwyll, “both</a>
<a id='line_6236'>to-day and every day while the feast shall last.”  So Pwyll arose, and he</a>
<a id='line_6237'>caused silence to be proclaimed, and desired all the suitors and the</a>
<a id='line_6238'>minstrels to show and to point out what gifts were to their wish and</a>
<a id='line_6239'>desire.  And this being done, the feast went on, and he denied no one</a>
<a id='line_6240'>while it lasted.  And when the feast was ended, Pwyll said unto Heveydd,</a>
<a id='line_6241'>“My Lord, with thy permission I will set out for Dyved to-morrow.”</a>
<a id='line_6242'>“Certainly,” said Heveydd, “may Heaven prosper thee.  Fix also a time</a>
<a id='line_6243'>when Rhiannon may follow thee.”  “By Heaven,” said Pwyll, “we will go</a>
<a id='line_6244'>hence together.”  “Willest thou this, Lord?” said Heveydd.  “Yes, by</a>
<a id='line_6245'>Heaven,” answered Pwyll.</a>
<a id='line_6246'></a>
<a id='line_6247'>And the next day, they set forward towards Dyved, and journeyed to the</a>
<a id='line_6248'>palace of Narberth, where a feast was made ready for them.  And there</a>
<a id='line_6249'>came to them great numbers of the chief men and the most noble ladies of</a>
<a id='line_6250'>the land, and of these there was none to whom Rhiannon did not give some</a>
<a id='line_6251'>rich gift, either a bracelet, or a ring, or a precious stone.  And they</a>
<a id='line_6252'>ruled the land prosperously both that year and the next.</a>
<a id='line_6253'></a>
<a id='line_6254'>And in the third year the nobles of the land began to be sorrowful at</a>
<a id='line_6255'>seeing a man whom they loved so much, and who was moreover their lord and</a>
<a id='line_6256'>their foster-brother, without an heir.  And they came to him.  And the</a>
<a id='line_6257'>place where they met was Preseleu, in Dyved.  “Lord,” said they, “we know</a>
<a id='line_6258'>that thou art not so young as some of the men of this country, and we</a>
<a id='line_6259'>fear that thou mayest not have an heir of the wife whom thou hast taken.</a>
<a id='line_6260'>Take therefore another wife of whom thou mayest have heirs.  Thou canst</a>
<a id='line_6261'>not always continue with us, and though thou desire to remain as thou</a>
<a id='line_6262'>art, we will not suffer thee.”  “Truly,” said Pwyll, “we have not long</a>
<a id='line_6263'>been joined together, and many things may yet befall.  Grant me a year</a>
<a id='line_6264'>from this time, and for the space of a year we will abide together, and</a>
<a id='line_6265'>after that I will do according to your wishes.”  So they granted it.  And</a>
<a id='line_6266'>before the end of a year a son was born unto him.  And in Narberth was he</a>
<a id='line_6267'>born; and on the night that he was born, women were brought to watch the</a>
<a id='line_6268'>mother and the boy.  And the women slept, as did also Rhiannon, the</a>
<a id='line_6269'>mother of the boy.  And the number of the women that were brought into</a>
<a id='line_6270'>the chamber was six.  And they watched for a good portion of the night,</a>
<a id='line_6271'>and before midnight every one of them fell asleep, and towards break of</a>
<a id='line_6272'>day they awoke; and when they awoke, they looked where they had put the</a>
<a id='line_6273'>boy, and behold he was not there.  “Oh,” said one of the women, “the boy</a>
<a id='line_6274'>is lost?”  “Yes,” said another, “and it will be small vengeance if we are</a>
<a id='line_6275'>burnt or put to death because of the child.”  Said one of the women, “Is</a>
<a id='line_6276'>there any counsel for us in the world in this matter?”  “There is,”</a>
<a id='line_6277'>answered another, “I offer you good counsel.”  “What is that?” asked</a>
<a id='line_6278'>they.  “There is here a stag-hound bitch, and she has a litter of whelps.</a>
<a id='line_6279'>Let us kill some of the cubs, and rub the blood on the face and hands of</a>
<a id='line_6280'>Rhiannon, and lay the bones before her, and assert that she herself hath</a>
<a id='line_6281'>devoured her son, and she alone will not be able to gainsay us six.”  And</a>
<a id='line_6282'>according to this counsel it was settled.  And towards morning Rhiannon</a>
<a id='line_6283'>awoke, and she said, “Women, where is my son?”  “Lady,” said they, “ask</a>
<a id='line_6284'>us not concerning thy son, we have nought but the blows and the bruises</a>
<a id='line_6285'>we got by struggling with thee, and of a truth we never saw any woman so</a>
<a id='line_6286'>violent as thou, for it was of no avail to contend with thee.  Hast thou</a>
<a id='line_6287'>not thyself devoured thy son?  Claim him not therefore of us.”  “For</a>
<a id='line_6288'>pity’s sake,” said Rhiannon; “the Lord God knows all things.  Charge me</a>
<a id='line_6289'>not falsely.  If you tell me this from fear, I assert before Heaven that</a>
<a id='line_6290'>I will defend you.”  “Truly,” said they, “we would not bring evil on</a>
<a id='line_6291'>ourselves for any one in the world.”  “For pity’s sake,” said Rhiannon,</a>
<a id='line_6292'>“you will receive no evil by telling the truth.”  But for all her words,</a>
<a id='line_6293'>whether fair or harsh, she received but the same answer from the women.</a>
<a id='line_6294'></a>
<a id='line_6295'>And Pwyll the chief of Annwvyn arose, and his household, and his hosts.</a>
<a id='line_6296'>And this occurrence could not be concealed, but the story went forth</a>
<a id='line_6297'>throughout the land, and all the nobles heard it.  Then the nobles came</a>
<a id='line_6298'>to Pwyll, and besought him to put away his wife, because of the great</a>
<a id='line_6299'>crime which she had done.  But Pwyll answered them, that they had no</a>
<a id='line_6300'>cause wherefore they might ask him to put away his wife, save for her</a>
<a id='line_6301'>having no children.  “But children has she now had, therefore will I not</a>
<a id='line_6302'>put her away; if she has done wrong, let her do penance for it.”</a>
<a id='line_6303'></a>
<a id='line_6304'>So Rhiannon sent for the teachers and the wise men, and as she preferred</a>
<a id='line_6305'>doing penance to contending with the women, she took upon her a penance.</a>
<a id='line_6306'>And the penance that was imposed upon her was, that she should remain in</a>
<a id='line_6307'>that palace of Narberth until the end of seven years, and that she should</a>
<a id='line_6308'>sit every day near unto a horseblock that was without the gate.  And that</a>
<a id='line_6309'>she should relate the story to all who should come there, whom she might</a>
<a id='line_6310'>suppose not to know it already; and that she should offer the guests and</a>
<a id='line_6311'>strangers, if they would permit her, to carry them upon her back into the</a>
<a id='line_6312'>palace.  But it rarely happened that any would permit.  And thus did she</a>
<a id='line_6313'>spend part of the year.</a>
<a id='line_6314'></a>
<a id='line_6315'>Now at that time Teirnyon Twryv Vliant was Lord of Gwent Is Coed, and he</a>
<a id='line_6316'>was the best man in the world.  And unto his house there belonged a mare,</a>
<a id='line_6317'>than which neither mare nor horse in the kingdom was more beautiful.  And</a>
<a id='line_6318'>on the night of every first of May she foaled, and no one ever knew what</a>
<a id='line_6319'>became of the colt.  And one night Teirnyon talked with his wife: “Wife,”</a>
<a id='line_6320'>said he, “it is very simple of us that our mare should foal every year,</a>
<a id='line_6321'>and that we should have none of her colts.”  “What can be done in the</a>
<a id='line_6322'>matter?” said she.  “This is the night of the first of May,” said he.</a>
<a id='line_6323'>“The vengeance of Heaven be upon me, if I learn not what it is that takes</a>
<a id='line_6324'>away the colts.”  So he caused the mare to be brought into a house, and</a>
<a id='line_6325'>he armed himself, and began to watch that night.  And in the beginning of</a>
<a id='line_6326'>the night, the mare foaled a large and beautiful colt.  And it was</a>
<a id='line_6327'>standing up in the place.  And Teirnyon rose up and looked at the size of</a>
<a id='line_6328'>the colt, and as he did so he heard a great tumult, and after the tumult</a>
<a id='line_6329'>behold a claw came through the window into the house, and it seized the</a>
<a id='line_6330'>colt by the mane.  Then Teirnyon drew his sword, and struck off the arm</a>
<a id='line_6331'>at the elbow, so that portion of the arm together with the colt was in</a>
<a id='line_6332'>the house with him.  And then did he hear a tumult and wailing, both at</a>
<a id='line_6333'>once.  And he opened the door, and rushed out in the direction of the</a>
<a id='line_6334'>noise, and he could not see the cause of the tumult because of the</a>
<a id='line_6335'>darkness of the night, but he rushed after it and followed it.  Then he</a>
<a id='line_6336'>remembered that he had left the door open, and he returned.  And at the</a>
<a id='line_6337'>door behold there was an infant boy in swaddling-clothes, wrapped around</a>
<a id='line_6338'>in a mantle of satin.  And he took up the boy, and behold he was very</a>
<a id='line_6339'>strong for the age that he was of.</a>
<a id='line_6340'></a>
<a id='line_6341'>Then he shut the door, and went into the chamber where his wife was.</a>
<a id='line_6342'>“Lady,” said he, “art thou sleeping?”  “No, lord,” said she, “I was</a>
<a id='line_6343'>asleep, but as thou camest in I did awake.”  “Behold, here is a boy for</a>
<a id='line_6344'>thee if thou wilt,” said he, “since thou hast never had one.”  “My lord,”</a>
<a id='line_6345'>said she, “what adventure is this?”  “It was thus,” said Teirnyon; and he</a>
<a id='line_6346'>told her how it all befell.  “Verily, lord,” said she, “what sort of</a>
<a id='line_6347'>garments are there upon the boy?”  “A mantle of satin,” said he.  “He is</a>
<a id='line_6348'>then a boy of gentle lineage,” she replied.  “My lord,” she said, “if</a>
<a id='line_6349'>thou wilt, I shall have great diversion and mirth.  I will call my women</a>
<a id='line_6350'>unto me, and tell them that I have been pregnant.”  “I will readily grant</a>
<a id='line_6351'>thee to do this,” he answered.  And thus did they, and they caused the</a>
<a id='line_6352'>boy to be baptized, and the ceremony was performed there; and the name</a>
<a id='line_6353'>which they gave unto him was Gwri Wallt Euryn, because what hair was upon</a>
<a id='line_6354'>his head was as yellow as gold.  And they had the boy nursed in the Court</a>
<a id='line_6355'>until he was a year old.  And before the year was over he could walk</a>
<a id='line_6356'>stoutly.  And he was larger than a boy of three years old, even one of</a>
<a id='line_6357'>great growth and size.  And the boy was nursed the second year, and then</a>
<a id='line_6358'>he was as large as a child six years old.  And before the end of the</a>
<a id='line_6359'>fourth year, he would bribe the grooms to allow him to take the horses to</a>
<a id='line_6360'>water.  “My lord,” said his wife unto Teirnyon, “where is the colt which</a>
<a id='line_6361'>thou didst save on the night that thou didst find the boy?”  “I have</a>
<a id='line_6362'>commanded the grooms of the horses,” said he, “that they take care of</a>
<a id='line_6363'>him.”  “Would it not be well, lord,” said she, “if thou wert to cause him</a>
<a id='line_6364'>to be broken in, and given to the boy, seeing that on the same night that</a>
<a id='line_6365'>thou didst find the boy, the colt was foaled and thou didst save him?”</a>
<a id='line_6366'>“I will not oppose thee in this matter,” said Teirnyon.  “I will allow</a>
<a id='line_6367'>thee to give him the colt.”  “Lord,” said she, “may Heaven reward thee; I</a>
<a id='line_6368'>will give it him.”  So the horse was given to the boy.  Then she went to</a>
<a id='line_6369'>the grooms and those who tended the horses, and commanded them to be</a>
<a id='line_6370'>careful of the horse, so that he might be broken in by the time that the</a>
<a id='line_6371'>boy could ride him.</a>
<a id='line_6372'></a>
<a id='line_6373'>And while these things were going forward, they heard tidings of Rhiannon</a>
<a id='line_6374'>and her punishment.  And Teirnyon Twryv Vliant, by reason of the pity</a>
<a id='line_6375'>that he felt on hearing this story of Rhiannon and her punishment,</a>
<a id='line_6376'>inquired closely concerning it, until he had heard from many of those who</a>
<a id='line_6377'>came to his court.  Then did Teirnyon, often lamenting the sad history,</a>
<a id='line_6378'>ponder within himself, and he looked steadfastly on the boy, and as he</a>
<a id='line_6379'>looked upon him, it seemed to him that he had never beheld so great a</a>
<a id='line_6380'>likeness between father and son, as between the boy and Pwyll the Chief</a>
<a id='line_6381'>of Annwvyn.  Now the semblance of Pwyll was well known to him, for he had</a>
<a id='line_6382'>of yore been one of his followers.  And thereupon he became grieved for</a>
<a id='line_6383'>the wrong that he did, in keeping with him a boy whom he knew to be the</a>
<a id='line_6384'>son of another man.  And the first time that he was alone with his wife,</a>
<a id='line_6385'>he told her that it was not right that they should keep the boy with</a>
<a id='line_6386'>them, and suffer so excellent a lady as Rhiannon to be punished so</a>
<a id='line_6387'>greatly on his account, whereas the boy was the son of Pwyll the Chief of</a>
<a id='line_6388'>Annwvyn.  And Teirnyon’s wife agreed with him, that they should send the</a>
<a id='line_6389'>boy to Pwyll.  “And three things, lord,” said she, “shall we gain</a>
<a id='line_6390'>thereby.  Thanks and gifts for releasing Rhiannon from her punishment;</a>
<a id='line_6391'>and thanks from Pwyll for nursing his son and restoring him unto him; and</a>
<a id='line_6392'>thirdly, if the boy is of gentle nature, he will be our foster-son, and</a>
<a id='line_6393'>he will do for us all the good in his power.”  So it was settled</a>
<a id='line_6394'>according to this counsel.</a>
<a id='line_6395'></a>
<a id='line_6396'>And no later than the next day was Teirnyon equipped, and two other</a>
<a id='line_6397'>knights with him.  And the boy, as a fourth in their company, went with</a>
<a id='line_6398'>them upon the horse which Teirnyon had given him.  And they journeyed</a>
<a id='line_6399'>towards Narberth, and it was not long before they reached that place.</a>
<a id='line_6400'>And as they drew near to the palace, they beheld Rhiannon sitting beside</a>
<a id='line_6401'>the horseblock.  And when they were opposite to her, “Chieftain,” said</a>
<a id='line_6402'>she, “go not further thus, I will bear every one of you into the palace,</a>
<a id='line_6403'>and this is my penance for slaying my own son and devouring him.”  “Oh,</a>
<a id='line_6404'>fair lady,” said Teirnyon, “think not that I will be one to be carried</a>
<a id='line_6405'>upon thy back.”  “Neither will I,” said the boy.  “Truly, my soul,” said</a>
<a id='line_6406'>Teirnyon, “we will not go.”  So they went forward to the palace, and</a>
<a id='line_6407'>there was great joy at their coming.  And at the palace a feast was</a>
<a id='line_6408'>prepared, because Pywll was come back from the confines of Dyved.  And</a>
<a id='line_6409'>they went into the hall and washed, and Pwyll rejoiced to see Teirnyon.</a>
<a id='line_6410'>And in this order they sat.  Teirnyon between Pwyll and Rhiannon, and</a>
<a id='line_6411'>Teirnyon’s two companions on the other side of Pwyll, with the boy</a>
<a id='line_6412'>between them.  And after meat they began to carouse and to discourse.</a>
<a id='line_6413'>And Teirnyon’s discourse was concerning the adventure of the mare and the</a>
<a id='line_6414'>boy, and how he and his wife had nursed and reared the child as their</a>
<a id='line_6415'>own.  “And behold here is thy son, lady,” said Teirnyon.  “And whosoever</a>
<a id='line_6416'>told that lie concerning thee, has done wrong.  And when I heard of thy</a>
<a id='line_6417'>sorrow, I was troubled and grieved.  And I believe that there is none of</a>
<a id='line_6418'>this host who will not perceive that the boy is the son of Pwyll,” said</a>
<a id='line_6419'>Teirnyon.  “There is none,” said they all, “who is not certain thereof.”</a>
<a id='line_6420'>“I declare to Heaven,” said Rhiannon, “that if this be true, there is</a>
<a id='line_6421'>indeed an end to my trouble.”  “Lady,” said Pendaran Dyved, “well hast</a>
<a id='line_6422'>thou named thy son Pryderi, {3} and well becomes him the name of Pryderi</a>
<a id='line_6423'>son of Pwyll Chief of Annwvyn.”  “Look you,” said Rhiannon, “will not his</a>
<a id='line_6424'>own name become him better?”  “What name has he?” asked Pendaran Dyved.</a>
<a id='line_6425'>“Gwri Wallt Euryn is the name that we gave him.”  “Pryderi,” said</a>
<a id='line_6426'>Pendaran, “shall his name be.”  “It were more proper,” said Pwyll, “that</a>
<a id='line_6427'>the boy should take his name from the word his mother spoke when she</a>
<a id='line_6428'>received the joyful tidings of him.”  And thus was it arranged.</a>
<a id='line_6429'></a>
<a id='line_6430'>“Teirnyon,” said Pwyll, “Heaven reward thee that thou hast reared the boy</a>
<a id='line_6431'>up to this time, and, being of gentle lineage, it were fitting that he</a>
<a id='line_6432'>repay thee for it.”  “My lord,” said Teirnyon, “it was my wife who nursed</a>
<a id='line_6433'>him, and there is no one in the world so afflicted as she at parting with</a>
<a id='line_6434'>him.  It were well that he should bear in mind what I and my wife have</a>
<a id='line_6435'>done for him.”  “I call Heaven to witness,” said Pwyll, “that while I</a>
<a id='line_6436'>live I will support thee and thy possessions, as long as I am able to</a>
<a id='line_6437'>preserve my own.  And when he shall have power, he will more fitly</a>
<a id='line_6438'>maintain them than I.  And if this counsel be pleasing unto thee, and to</a>
<a id='line_6439'>my nobles, it shall be that, as thou hast reared him up to the present</a>
<a id='line_6440'>time, I will give him to be brought up by Pendaran Dyved, from</a>
<a id='line_6441'>henceforth.  And you shall be companions, and shall both be</a>
<a id='line_6442'>foster-fathers unto him.”  “This is good counsel,” said they all.  So the</a>
<a id='line_6443'>boy was given to Pendaran Dyved, and the nobles of the land were sent</a>
<a id='line_6444'>with him.  And Teirnyon Twryv Vliant, and his companions, set out for his</a>
<a id='line_6445'>country, and his possessions, with love and gladness.  And he went not</a>
<a id='line_6446'>without being offered the fairest jewels and the fairest horses, and the</a>
<a id='line_6447'>choicest dogs; but he would take none of them.</a>
<a id='line_6448'></a>
<a id='line_6449'>Thereupon they all remained in their own dominions.  And Pryderi, the son</a>
<a id='line_6450'>of Pwyll the Chief of Annwvyn, was brought up carefully as was fit, so</a>
<a id='line_6451'>that he became the fairest youth, and the most comely, and the best</a>
<a id='line_6452'>skilled in all good games, of any in the kingdom.  And thus passed years</a>
<a id='line_6453'>and years, until the end of Pwyll the Chief of Annwvyn’s life came, and</a>
<a id='line_6454'>he died.</a>
<a id='line_6455'></a>
<a id='line_6456'>And Pryderi ruled the seven Cantrevs of Dyved prosperously, and he was</a>
<a id='line_6457'>beloved by his people, and by all around him.  And at length he added</a>
<a id='line_6458'>unto them the three Cantrevs of Ystrad Tywi, and the four Cantrevs of</a>
<a id='line_6459'>Cardigan; and these were called the Seven Cantrevs of Seissyllwch.  And</a>
<a id='line_6460'>when he made this addition, Pryderi the son of Pwyll the Chief of Annwvyn</a>
<a id='line_6461'>desired to take a wife.  And the wife he chose was Kicva, the daughter of</a>
<a id='line_6462'>Gwynn Gohoyw, the son of Gloyw Wallt Lydan, the son of Prince Casnar, one</a>
<a id='line_6463'>of the nobles of this Island.</a>
<a id='line_6464'></a>
<a id='line_6465'>And thus ends this portion of the Mabinogion.</a>
<a id='line_6466'></a>
<a id='line_6467'></a>
<a id='line_6468'></a>
<a id='line_6469'></a>
<a id='line_6470'>BRANWEN THE DAUGHTER OF LLYR</a>
<a id='line_6471'>HERE IS THE SECOND PORTION OF THE MABINOGI</a>
<a id='line_6472'></a>
<a id='line_6473'></a>
<a id='line_6474'>BENDIGEID VRAN, the son of Llyr, was the crowned king of this island, and</a>
<a id='line_6475'>he was exalted from the crown of London.  And one afternoon he was at</a>
<a id='line_6476'>Harlech in Ardudwy, at his Court, and he sat upon the rock of Harlech,</a>
<a id='line_6477'>looking over the sea.  And with him were his brother Manawyddan the son</a>
<a id='line_6478'>of Llyr, and his brothers by the mother’s side, Nissyen and Evnissyen,</a>
<a id='line_6479'>and many nobles likewise, as was fitting to see around a king.  His two</a>
<a id='line_6480'>brothers by the mother’s side were the sons of Eurosswydd, by his mother,</a>
<a id='line_6481'>Penardun, the daughter of Beli son of Manogan.  And one of these youths</a>
<a id='line_6482'>was a good youth and of gentle nature, and would make peace between his</a>
<a id='line_6483'>kindred, and cause his family to be friends when their wrath was at the</a>
<a id='line_6484'>highest; and this one was Nissyen; but the other would cause strife</a>
<a id='line_6485'>between his two brothers when they were most at peace.  And as they sat</a>
<a id='line_6486'>thus, they beheld thirteen ships coming from the south of Ireland, and</a>
<a id='line_6487'>making towards them, and they came with a swift motion, the wind being</a>
<a id='line_6488'>behind them, and they neared them rapidly.  “I see ships afar,” said the</a>
<a id='line_6489'>king, “coming swiftly towards the land.  Command the men of the Court</a>
<a id='line_6490'>that they equip themselves, and go and learn their intent.”  So the men</a>
<a id='line_6491'>equipped themselves and went down towards them.  And when they saw the</a>
<a id='line_6492'>ships near, certain were they that they had never seen ships better</a>
<a id='line_6493'>furnished.  Beautiful flags of satin were upon them.  And behold one of</a>
<a id='line_6494'>the ships outstripped the others, and they saw a shield lifted up above</a>
<a id='line_6495'>the side of the ship, and the point of the shield was upwards, in token</a>
<a id='line_6496'>of peace.  And the men drew near that they might hold converse.  Then</a>
<a id='line_6497'>they put out boats and came towards the land.  And they saluted the king.</a>
<a id='line_6498'>Now the king could hear them from the place where he was, upon the rock</a>
<a id='line_6499'>above their heads.  “Heaven prosper you,” said he, “and be ye welcome.</a>
<a id='line_6500'>To whom do these ships belong, and who is the chief amongst you?”</a>
<a id='line_6501'>“Lord,” said they, “Matholwch, king of Ireland, is here, and these ships</a>
<a id='line_6502'>belong to him.”  “Wherefore comes he?” asked the king, “and will he come</a>
<a id='line_6503'>to the land?”  “He is a suitor unto thee, lord,” said they, “and he will</a>
<a id='line_6504'>not land unless he have his boon.”  “And what may that be?” inquired the</a>
<a id='line_6505'>king.  “He desires to ally himself with thee, lord,” said they, “and he</a>
<a id='line_6506'>comes to ask Branwen the daughter of Llyr, that, if it seem well to thee,</a>
<a id='line_6507'>the Island of the Mighty may be leagued with Ireland, and both become</a>
<a id='line_6508'>more powerful.”  “Verily,” said he, “let him come to land, and we will</a>
<a id='line_6509'>take counsel thereupon.”  And this answer was brought to Matholwch.  “I</a>
<a id='line_6510'>will go willingly,” said he.  So he landed, and they received him</a>
<a id='line_6511'>joyfully; and great was the throng in the palace that night, between his</a>
<a id='line_6512'>hosts and those of the Court; and next day they took counsel, and they</a>
<a id='line_6513'>resolved to bestow Branwen upon Matholwch.  Now she was one of the three</a>
<a id='line_6514'>chief ladies of this island, and she was the fairest damsel in the world.</a>
<a id='line_6515'></a>
<a id='line_6516'>And they fixed upon Aberffraw as the place where she should become his</a>
<a id='line_6517'>bride.  And they went thence, and towards Aberffraw the hosts proceeded;</a>
<a id='line_6518'>Matholwch and his host in their ships; Bendigeid Vran and his host by</a>
<a id='line_6519'>land, until they came to Aberffraw.  And at Aberffraw they began the</a>
<a id='line_6520'>feast and sat down.  And thus sat they.  The King of the Island of the</a>
<a id='line_6521'>Mighty and Manawyddan the son of Llyr on one side, and Matholwch on the</a>
<a id='line_6522'>other side, and Branwen the daughter of Llyr beside him.  And they were</a>
<a id='line_6523'>not within a house, but under tents.  No house could ever contain</a>
<a id='line_6524'>Bendigeid Vran.  And they began the banquet and caroused and discoursed.</a>
<a id='line_6525'>And when it was more pleasing to them to sleep than to carouse, they went</a>
<a id='line_6526'>to rest, and that night Branwen became Matholwch’s bride.</a>
<a id='line_6527'></a>
<a id='line_6528'>And next day they arose, and all they of the Court, and the officers</a>
<a id='line_6529'>began to equip and to range the horses and the attendants, and they</a>
<a id='line_6530'>ranged them in order as far as the sea.</a>
<a id='line_6531'></a>
<a id='line_6532'>And behold one day, Evnissyen, the quarrelsome man of whom it is spoken</a>
<a id='line_6533'>above, came by chance into the place, where the horses of Matholwch were,</a>
<a id='line_6534'>and asked whose horses they might be.  “They are the horses of Matholwch</a>
<a id='line_6535'>king of Ireland, who is married to Branwen, thy sister; his horses are</a>
<a id='line_6536'>they.”  “And is it thus they have done with a maiden such as she, and</a>
<a id='line_6537'>moreover my sister, bestowing her without my consent?  They could have</a>
<a id='line_6538'>offered no greater insult to me than this,” said he.  And thereupon he</a>
<a id='line_6539'>rushed under the horses and cut off their lips at the teeth, and their</a>
<a id='line_6540'>ears close to their heads, and their tails close to their backs, and</a>
<a id='line_6541'>wherever he could clutch their eyelids, he cut them to the very bone, and</a>
<a id='line_6542'>he disfigured the horses and rendered them useless.</a>
<a id='line_6543'></a>
<a id='line_6544'>And they came with these tidings unto Matholwch, saying that the horses</a>
<a id='line_6545'>were disfigured, and injured so that not one of them could ever be of any</a>
<a id='line_6546'>use again.  “Verily, lord,” said one, “it was an insult unto thee, and as</a>
<a id='line_6547'>such was it meant.”  “Of a truth, it is a marvel to me, that if they</a>
<a id='line_6548'>desire to insult me, they should have given me a maiden of such high rank</a>
<a id='line_6549'>and so much beloved of her kindred, as they have done.”  “Lord,” said</a>
<a id='line_6550'>another, “thou seest that thus it is, and there is nothing for thee to do</a>
<a id='line_6551'>but to go to thy ships.”  And thereupon towards his ships he set out.</a>
<a id='line_6552'></a>
<a id='line_6553'>And tidings came to Bendigeid Vran that Matholwch was quitting the Court</a>
<a id='line_6554'>without asking leave, and messengers were sent to inquire of him</a>
<a id='line_6555'>wherefore he did so.  And the messengers that went were Iddic the son of</a>
<a id='line_6556'>Anarawd, and Heveydd Hir.  And these overtook him and asked of him what</a>
<a id='line_6557'>he designed to do, and wherefore he went forth.  “Of a truth,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_6558'>“if I had known I had not come hither.  I have been altogether insulted,</a>
<a id='line_6559'>no one had ever worse treatment than I have had here.  But one thing</a>
<a id='line_6560'>surprises me above all.”  “What is that?” asked they.  “That Branwen the</a>
<a id='line_6561'>daughter of Llyr, one of the three chief ladies of this island, and the</a>
<a id='line_6562'>daughter of the King of the Island of the Mighty, should have been given</a>
<a id='line_6563'>me as my bride, and that after that I should have been insulted; and I</a>
<a id='line_6564'>marvel that the insult was not done me before they had bestowed upon me a</a>
<a id='line_6565'>maiden so exalted as she.”  “Truly, lord, it was not the will of any that</a>
<a id='line_6566'>are of the Court,” said they, “nor of any that are of the council, that</a>
<a id='line_6567'>thou shouldest have received this insult; and as thou hast been insulted,</a>
<a id='line_6568'>the dishonour is greater unto Bendigeid Vran than unto thee.”  “Verily,”</a>
<a id='line_6569'>said he, “I think so.  Nevertheless he cannot recall the insult.”  These</a>
<a id='line_6570'>men returned with that answer to the place where Bendigeid Vran was, and</a>
<a id='line_6571'>they told him what reply Matholwch had given them.  “Truly,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_6572'>“there are no means by which we may prevent his going away at enmity with</a>
<a id='line_6573'>us, that we will not take.”  “Well, lord,” said they, “send after him</a>
<a id='line_6574'>another embassy.”  “I will do so,” said he.  “Arise, Manawyddan son of</a>
<a id='line_6575'>Llyr, and Heveydd Hir, and Unic Glew Ysgwyd, and go after him, and tell</a>
<a id='line_6576'>him that he shall have a sound horse for every one that has been injured.</a>
<a id='line_6577'>And beside that, as an atonement for the insult, he shall have a staff of</a>
<a id='line_6578'>silver, as large and as tall as himself, and a plate of gold of the</a>
<a id='line_6579'>breadth of his face.  And show unto him who it was that did this, and</a>
<a id='line_6580'>that it was done against my will; but that he who did it is my brother,</a>
<a id='line_6581'>by the mother’s side, and therefore it would be hard for me to put him to</a>
<a id='line_6582'>death.  And let him come and meet me,” said he, “and we will make peace</a>
<a id='line_6583'>in any way he may desire.”</a>
<a id='line_6584'></a>
<a id='line_6585'>The embassy went after Matholwch, and told him all these sayings in a</a>
<a id='line_6586'>friendly manner, and he listened thereunto.  “Men,” said he, “I will take</a>
<a id='line_6587'>counsel.”  So to the council he went.  And in the council they considered</a>
<a id='line_6588'>that if they should refuse this, they were likely to have more shame</a>
<a id='line_6589'>rather than to obtain so great an atonement.  They resolved therefore to</a>
<a id='line_6590'>accept it, and they returned to the Court in peace.</a>
<a id='line_6591'></a>
<a id='line_6592'>Then the pavilions and the tents were set in order after the fashion of a</a>
<a id='line_6593'>hall; and they went to meat, and as they had sat at the beginning of the</a>
<a id='line_6594'>feast, so sat they there.  And Matholwch and Bendigeid Vran began to</a>
<a id='line_6595'>discourse; and behold it seemed to Bendigeid Vran, while they talked,</a>
<a id='line_6596'>that Matholwch was not so cheerful as he had been before.  And he thought</a>
<a id='line_6597'>that the chieftain might be sad, because of the smallness of the</a>
<a id='line_6598'>atonement which he had, for the wrong that had been done him.  “Oh, man,”</a>
<a id='line_6599'>said Bendigeid Vran, “thou dost not discourse to-night so cheerfully as</a>
<a id='line_6600'>thou wast wont.  And if it be because of the smallness of the atonement,</a>
<a id='line_6601'>thou shalt add thereunto whatsoever thou mayest choose, and to-morrow I</a>
<a id='line_6602'>will pay thee the horses.”  “Lord,” said he, “Heaven reward thee.”  “And</a>
<a id='line_6603'>I will enhance the atonement,” said Bendigeid Vran, “for I will give unto</a>
<a id='line_6604'>thee a cauldron, the property of which is, that if one of thy men be</a>
<a id='line_6605'>slain to-day, and be cast therein, to-morrow he will be as well as ever</a>
<a id='line_6606'>he was at the best, except that he will not regain his speech.”  And</a>
<a id='line_6607'>thereupon he gave him great thanks, and very joyful was he for that</a>
<a id='line_6608'>cause.</a>
<a id='line_6609'></a>
<a id='line_6610'>And the next morning they paid Matholwch the horses as long as the</a>
<a id='line_6611'>trained horses lasted.  And then they journeyed into another commot,</a>
<a id='line_6612'>where they paid him with colts until the whole had been paid, and from</a>
<a id='line_6613'>thenceforth that commot was called Talebolion.</a>
<a id='line_6614'></a>
<a id='line_6615'>And a second night sat they together.  “My lord,” said Matholwch, “whence</a>
<a id='line_6616'>hadst thou the cauldron which thou hast given me?”  “I had it of a man</a>
<a id='line_6617'>who had been in thy land,” said he, “and I would not give it except to</a>
<a id='line_6618'>one from there.”  “Who was it?” asked he.  “Llassar Llaesgyvnewid; he</a>
<a id='line_6619'>came here from Ireland with Kymideu Kymeinvoll, his wife, who escaped</a>
<a id='line_6620'>from the Iron House in Ireland, when it was made red hot around them, and</a>
<a id='line_6621'>fled hither.  And it is a marvel to me that thou shouldst know nothing</a>
<a id='line_6622'>concerning the matter.”  “Something I do know,” said he, “and as much as</a>
<a id='line_6623'>I know I will tell thee.  One day I was hunting in Ireland, and I came to</a>
<a id='line_6624'>the mound at the head of the lake, which is called the Lake of the</a>
<a id='line_6625'>Cauldron.  And I beheld a huge yellow-haired man coming from the lake</a>
<a id='line_6626'>with a cauldron upon his back.  And he was a man of vast size, and of</a>
<a id='line_6627'>horrid aspect, and a woman followed after him.  And if the man was tall,</a>
<a id='line_6628'>twice as large as he was the woman, and they came towards me and greeted</a>
<a id='line_6629'>me.  ‘Verily,’ asked I, ‘wherefore are you journeying?’  ‘Behold, this,’</a>
<a id='line_6630'>said he to me, ‘is the cause that we journey.  At the end of a month and</a>
<a id='line_6631'>a fortnight this woman will have a son; and the child that will be born</a>
<a id='line_6632'>at the end of the month and the fortnight will be a warrior fully armed.’</a>
<a id='line_6633'>So I took them with me and maintained them.  And they were with me for a</a>
<a id='line_6634'>year.  And that year I had them with me not grudgingly.  But thenceforth</a>
<a id='line_6635'>was there murmuring, because that they were with me.  For, from the</a>
<a id='line_6636'>beginning of the fourth month they had begun to make themselves hated and</a>
<a id='line_6637'>to be disorderly in the land; committing outrages, and molesting and</a>
<a id='line_6638'>harassing the nobles and ladies; and thenceforward my people rose up and</a>
<a id='line_6639'>besought me to part with them, and they bade me to choose between them</a>
<a id='line_6640'>and my dominions.  And I applied to the council of my country to know</a>
<a id='line_6641'>what should be done concerning them; for of their own free will they</a>
<a id='line_6642'>would not go, neither could they be compelled against their will, through</a>
<a id='line_6643'>fighting.  And [the people of the country] being in this strait, they</a>
<a id='line_6644'>caused a chamber to be made all of iron.  Now when the chamber was ready,</a>
<a id='line_6645'>there came there every smith that was in Ireland, and every one who owned</a>
<a id='line_6646'>tongs and hammer.  And they caused coals to be piled up as high as the</a>
<a id='line_6647'>top of the chamber.  And they had the man, and the woman, and the</a>
<a id='line_6648'>children, served with plenty of meat and drink; but when it was known</a>
<a id='line_6649'>that they were drunk, they began to put fire to the coals about the</a>
<a id='line_6650'>chamber, and they blew it with bellows until the house was red hot all</a>
<a id='line_6651'>around them.  Then was there a council held in the centre of the floor of</a>
<a id='line_6652'>the chamber.  And the man tarried until the plates of iron were all of a</a>
<a id='line_6653'>white heat; and then, by reason of the great heat, the man dashed against</a>
<a id='line_6654'>the plates with his shoulder and struck them out, and his wife followed</a>
<a id='line_6655'>him; but except him and his wife none escaped thence.  And then I</a>
<a id='line_6656'>suppose, lord,” said Matholwch unto Bendigeid Vran, “that he came over</a>
<a id='line_6657'>unto thee.”  “Doubtless he came here,” said he, “and gave unto me the</a>
<a id='line_6658'>cauldron.”  “In what manner didst thou receive them?”  “I dispersed them</a>
<a id='line_6659'>through every part of my dominions, and they have become numerous and are</a>
<a id='line_6660'>prospering everywhere, and they fortify the places where they are with</a>
<a id='line_6661'>men and arms, of the best that were ever seen.”</a>
<a id='line_6662'></a>
<a id='line_6663'>That night they continued to discourse as much as they would, and had</a>
<a id='line_6664'>minstrelsy and carousing, and when it was more pleasant to them to sleep</a>
<a id='line_6665'>than to sit longer, they went to rest.  And thus was the banquet carried</a>
<a id='line_6666'>on with joyousness; and when it was finished, Matholwch journeyed towards</a>
<a id='line_6667'>Ireland, and Branwen with him, and they went from Aber Menei with</a>
<a id='line_6668'>thirteen ships, and came to Ireland.  And in Ireland was there great joy</a>
<a id='line_6669'>because of their coming.  And not one great man or noble lady visited</a>
<a id='line_6670'>Branwen unto whom she gave not either a clasp, or a ring, or a royal</a>
<a id='line_6671'>jewel to keep, such as it was honourable to be seen departing with.  And</a>
<a id='line_6672'>in these things she spent that year in much renown, and she passed her</a>
<a id='line_6673'>time pleasantly, enjoying honour and friendship.  And in the meanwhile it</a>
<a id='line_6674'>chanced that she became pregnant, and in due time a son was born unto</a>
<a id='line_6675'>her, and the name that they gave him was Gwern the son of Matholwch, and</a>
<a id='line_6676'>they put the boy out to be foster-nursed, in a place where were the best</a>
<a id='line_6677'>men of Ireland.</a>
<a id='line_6678'></a>
<a id='line_6679'>And behold in the second year a tumult arose in Ireland, on account of</a>
<a id='line_6680'>the insult which Matholwch had received in Cambria, and the payment made</a>
<a id='line_6681'>him for his horses.  And his foster-brothers, and such as were nearest</a>
<a id='line_6682'>unto him, blamed him openly for that matter.  And he might have no peace</a>
<a id='line_6683'>by reason of the tumult until they should revenge upon him this disgrace.</a>
<a id='line_6684'>And the vengeance which they took was to drive away Branwen from the same</a>
<a id='line_6685'>chamber with him, and to make her cook for the Court; and they caused the</a>
<a id='line_6686'>butcher after he had cut up the meat to come to her and give her every</a>
<a id='line_6687'>day a blow on the ear, and such they made her punishment.</a>
<a id='line_6688'></a>
<a id='line_6689'>“Verily, lord,” said his men to Matholwch, “forbid now the ships and the</a>
<a id='line_6690'>ferry boats and the coracles, that they go not into Cambria, and such as</a>
<a id='line_6691'>come over from Cambria hither, imprison them that they go not back for</a>
<a id='line_6692'>this thing to be known there.”  And he did so; and it was thus for not</a>
<a id='line_6693'>less than three years.</a>
<a id='line_6694'></a>
<a id='line_6695'>And Branwen reared a starling in the cover of the kneading trough, and</a>
<a id='line_6696'>she taught it to speak, and she taught the bird what manner of man her</a>
<a id='line_6697'>brother was.  And she wrote a letter of her woes, and the despite with</a>
<a id='line_6698'>which she was treated, and she bound the letter to the root of the bird’s</a>
<a id='line_6699'>wing, and sent it towards Britain.  And the bird came to this island, and</a>
<a id='line_6700'>one day it found Bendigeid Vran at Caer Seiont in Arvon, conferring</a>
<a id='line_6701'>there, and it alighted upon his shoulder and ruffled its feathers, so</a>
<a id='line_6702'>that the letter was seen, and they knew that the bird had been reared in</a>
<a id='line_6703'>a domestic manner.</a>
<a id='line_6704'></a>
<a id='line_6705'>Then Bendigeid Vran took the letter and looked upon it.  And when he had</a>
<a id='line_6706'>read the letter he grieved exceedingly at the tidings of Branwen’s woes.</a>
<a id='line_6707'>And immediately he began sending messengers to summon the island</a>
<a id='line_6708'>together.  And he caused sevenscore and four countries to come unto him,</a>
<a id='line_6709'>and he complained to them himself of the grief that his sister endured.</a>
<a id='line_6710'>So they took counsel.  And in the council they resolved to go to Ireland,</a>
<a id='line_6711'>and to leave seven men as princes here, and Caradawc, the son of Bran, as</a>
<a id='line_6712'>the chief of them, and their seven knights.  In Edeyrnion were these men</a>
<a id='line_6713'>left.  And for this reason were the seven knights placed in the town.</a>
<a id='line_6714'>Now the names of these seven men were, Caradawc the son of Bran, and</a>
<a id='line_6715'>Heveydd Hir, and Unic Glew Ysgwyd, and Iddic the son of Anarawc</a>
<a id='line_6716'>Gwalltgrwn, and Fodor the son of Ervyll, and Gwlch Minascwrn, and Llassar</a>
<a id='line_6717'>the son of Llaesar Llaesgygwyd, and Pendaran Dyved as a young page with</a>
<a id='line_6718'>them.  And these abode as seven ministers to take charge of this island;</a>
<a id='line_6719'>and Caradawc the son of Bran was the chief amongst them.</a>
<a id='line_6720'></a>
<a id='line_6721'>Bendigeid Vran, with the host of which we spoke, sailed towards Ireland,</a>
<a id='line_6722'>and it was not far across the sea, and he came to shoal water.  It was</a>
<a id='line_6723'>caused by two rivers; the Lli and the Archan were they called; and the</a>
<a id='line_6724'>nations covered the sea.  Then he proceeded with what provisions he had</a>
<a id='line_6725'>on his own back, and approached the shore of Ireland.</a>
<a id='line_6726'></a>
<a id='line_6727'>Now the swineherds of Matholwch were upon the seashore, and they came to</a>
<a id='line_6728'>Matholwch.  “Lord,” said they, “greeting be unto thee.”  “Heaven protect</a>
<a id='line_6729'>you,” said he, “have you any news?”  “Lord,” said they, “we have</a>
<a id='line_6730'>marvellous news, a wood have we seen upon the sea, in a place where we</a>
<a id='line_6731'>never yet saw a single tree.”  “This is indeed a marvel,” said he; “saw</a>
<a id='line_6732'>you aught else?”  “We saw, lord,” said they, “a vast mountain beside the</a>
<a id='line_6733'>wood, which moved, and there was a lofty ridge on the top of the</a>
<a id='line_6734'>mountain, and a lake on each side of the ridge.  And the wood, and the</a>
<a id='line_6735'>mountain, and all these things moved.”  “Verily,” said he, “there is none</a>
<a id='line_6736'>who can know aught concerning this, unless it be Branwen.”</a>
<a id='line_6737'></a>
<a id='line_6738'>Messengers then went unto Branwen.  “Lady,” said they, “what thinkest</a>
<a id='line_6739'>thou that this is?”  “The men of the Island of the Mighty, who have come</a>
<a id='line_6740'>hither on hearing of my ill-treatment and my woes.”  “What is the forest</a>
<a id='line_6741'>that is seen upon the sea?” asked they.  “The yards and the masts of</a>
<a id='line_6742'>ships,” she answered.  “Alas,” said they, “what is the mountain that is</a>
<a id='line_6743'>seen by the side of the ships?”  “Bendigeid Vran, my brother,” she</a>
<a id='line_6744'>replied, “coming to shoal water; there is no ship that can contain him in</a>
<a id='line_6745'>it.”  “What is the lofty ridge with the lake on each side thereof?”  “On</a>
<a id='line_6746'>looking towards this island he is wroth, and his two eyes, one on each</a>
<a id='line_6747'>side of his nose, are the two lakes beside the ridge.”</a>
<a id='line_6748'></a>
<a id='line_6749'>The warriors and the chief men of Ireland were brought together in haste,</a>
<a id='line_6750'>and they took counsel.  “Lord,” said the nobles unto Matholwch, “there is</a>
<a id='line_6751'>no other counsel than to retreat over the Linon (a river which is in</a>
<a id='line_6752'>Ireland), and to keep the river between thee and him, and to break down</a>
<a id='line_6753'>the bridge that is across the river, for there is a loadstone at the</a>
<a id='line_6754'>bottom of the river that neither ship nor vessel can pass over.”  So they</a>
<a id='line_6755'>retreated across the river, and broke down the bridge.</a>
<a id='line_6756'></a>
<a id='line_6757'>Bendigeid Vran came to land, and the fleet with him by the bank of the</a>
<a id='line_6758'>river.  “Lord,” said his chieftains, “knowest thou the nature of this</a>
<a id='line_6759'>river, that nothing can go across it, and there is no bridge over it?”</a>
<a id='line_6760'>“What,” said they, “is thy counsel concerning a bridge?”  “There is</a>
<a id='line_6761'>none,” said he, “except that he who will be chief, let him be a bridge.</a>
<a id='line_6762'>I will be so,” said he.  And then was that saying first uttered, and it</a>
<a id='line_6763'>is still used as a proverb.  And when he had lain down across the river,</a>
<a id='line_6764'>hurdles were placed upon him, and the host passed over thereby.</a>
<a id='line_6765'></a>
<a id='line_6766'>And as he rose up, behold the messengers of Matholwch came to him, and</a>
<a id='line_6767'>saluted him, and gave him greeting in the name of Matholwch, his kinsman,</a>
<a id='line_6768'>and showed how that of his goodwill he had merited of him nothing but</a>
<a id='line_6769'>good.  “For Matholwch has given the kingdom of Ireland to Gwern the son</a>
<a id='line_6770'>of Matholwch, thy nephew and thy sister’s son.  And this he places before</a>
<a id='line_6771'>thee, as a compensation for the wrong and despite that has been done unto</a>
<a id='line_6772'>Branwen.  And Matholwch shall be maintained wheresoever thou wilt, either</a>
<a id='line_6773'>here or in the Island of the Mighty.”  Said Bendigeid Vran, “Shall not I</a>
<a id='line_6774'>myself have the kingdom?  Then peradventure I may take counsel concerning</a>
<a id='line_6775'>your message.  From this time until then no other answer will you get</a>
<a id='line_6776'>from me.”  “Verily,” said they, “the best message that we receive for</a>
<a id='line_6777'>thee, we will convey it unto thee, and do thou await our message unto</a>
<a id='line_6778'>him.”  “I will wait,” answered he, “and do you return quickly.”</a>
<a id='line_6779'></a>
<a id='line_6780'>The messengers set forth and came to Matholwch.  “Lord,” said they,</a>
<a id='line_6781'>“prepare a better message for Bendigeid Vran.  He would not listen at all</a>
<a id='line_6782'>to the message that we bore him.”  “My friends,” said Matholwch, “what</a>
<a id='line_6783'>may be your counsel?”  “Lord,” said they, “there is no other counsel than</a>
<a id='line_6784'>this alone.  He was never known to be within a house, make therefore a</a>
<a id='line_6785'>house that will contain him and the men of the Island of the Mighty on</a>
<a id='line_6786'>the one side, and thyself and thy host on the other; and give over thy</a>
<a id='line_6787'>kingdom to his will, and do him homage.  So by reason of the honour thou</a>
<a id='line_6788'>doest him in making him a house, whereas he never before had a house to</a>
<a id='line_6789'>contain him, he will make peace with thee.”  So the messengers went back</a>
<a id='line_6790'>to Bendigeid Vran, bearing him this message.</a>
<a id='line_6791'></a>
<a id='line_6792'>And he took counsel, and in the council it was resolved that he should</a>
<a id='line_6793'>accept this, and this was all done by the advice of Branwen, and lest the</a>
<a id='line_6794'>country should be destroyed.  And this peace was made, and the house was</a>
<a id='line_6795'>built both vast and strong.  But the Irish planned a crafty device, and</a>
<a id='line_6796'>the craft was that they should put brackets on each side of the hundred</a>
<a id='line_6797'>pillars that were in the house, and should place a leathern bag on each</a>
<a id='line_6798'>bracket, and an armed man in every one of them.  Then Evnissyen came in</a>
<a id='line_6799'>before the host of the Island of the Mighty, and scanned the house with</a>
<a id='line_6800'>fierce and savage looks, and descried the leathern bags which were around</a>
<a id='line_6801'>the pillars.  “What is in this bag?” asked he of one of the Irish.</a>
<a id='line_6802'>“Meal, good soul,” said he.  And Evnissyen felt about it until he came to</a>
<a id='line_6803'>the man’s head, and he squeezed the head until he felt his fingers meet</a>
<a id='line_6804'>together in the brain through the bone.  And he left that one and put his</a>
<a id='line_6805'>hand upon another, and asked what was therein.  “Meal,” said the</a>
<a id='line_6806'>Irishman.  So he did the like unto every one of them, until he had not</a>
<a id='line_6807'>left alive, of all the two hundred men, save one only; and when he came</a>
<a id='line_6808'>to him, he asked what was there.  “Meal, good soul,” said the Irishman.</a>
<a id='line_6809'>And he felt about until he felt the head, and he squeezed that head as he</a>
<a id='line_6810'>had done the others.  And, albeit he found that the head of this one was</a>
<a id='line_6811'>armed, he left him not until he had killed him.  And then he sang an</a>
<a id='line_6812'>Englyn:—</a>
<a id='line_6813'></a>
<a id='line_6814'>   “There is in this bag a different sort of meal,</a>
<a id='line_6815'>   The ready combatant, when the assault is made</a>
<a id='line_6816'>   By his fellow-warriors, prepared for battle.”</a>
<a id='line_6817'></a>
<a id='line_6818'>Thereupon came the hosts unto the house.  The men of the Island of</a>
<a id='line_6819'>Ireland entered the house on the one side, and the men of the Island of</a>
<a id='line_6820'>the Mighty on the other.  And as soon as they had sat down there was</a>
<a id='line_6821'>concord between them; and the sovereignty was conferred upon the boy.</a>
<a id='line_6822'>When the peace was concluded, Bendigeid Vran called the boy unto him, and</a>
<a id='line_6823'>from Bendigeid Vran the boy went unto Manawyddan, and he was beloved by</a>
<a id='line_6824'>all that beheld him.  And from Manawyddan the boy was called by Nissyen</a>
<a id='line_6825'>the son of Eurosswydd, and the boy went unto him lovingly.  “Wherefore,”</a>
<a id='line_6826'>said Evnissyen, “comes not my nephew the son of my sister unto me?</a>
<a id='line_6827'>Though he were not king of Ireland, yet willingly would I fondle the</a>
<a id='line_6828'>boy.”  “Cheerfully let him go to thee,” said Bendigeid Vran, and the boy</a>
<a id='line_6829'>went unto him cheerfully.  “By my confession to Heaven,” said Evnissyen</a>
<a id='line_6830'>in his heart, “unthought of by the household is the slaughter that I will</a>
<a id='line_6831'>this instant commit.”</a>
<a id='line_6832'></a>
<a id='line_6833'>Then he arose and took up the boy by the feet, and before any one in the</a>
<a id='line_6834'>house could seize hold of him, he thrust the boy headlong into the</a>
<a id='line_6835'>blazing fire.  And when Branwen saw her son burning in the fire, she</a>
<a id='line_6836'>strove to leap into the fire also, from the place where she sat between</a>
<a id='line_6837'>her two brothers.  But Bendigeid Vran grasped her with one hand, and his</a>
<a id='line_6838'>shield with the other.  Then they all hurried about the house, and never</a>
<a id='line_6839'>was there made so great a tumult by any host in one house as was made by</a>
<a id='line_6840'>them, as each man armed himself.  Then said Morddwydtyllyon, “The</a>
<a id='line_6841'>gadflies of Morddwydtyllyon’s Cow!”  And while they all sought their</a>
<a id='line_6842'>arms, Bendigeid Vran supported Branwen between his shield and his</a>
<a id='line_6843'>shoulder.</a>
<a id='line_6844'></a>
<a id='line_6845'>Then the Irish kindled a fire under the cauldron of renovation, and they</a>
<a id='line_6846'>cast the dead bodies into the cauldron until it was full, and the next</a>
<a id='line_6847'>day they came forth fighting-men as good as before, except that they were</a>
<a id='line_6848'>not able to speak.  Then when Evnissyen saw the dead bodies of the men of</a>
<a id='line_6849'>the Island of the Mighty nowhere resuscitated, he said in his heart,</a>
<a id='line_6850'>“Alas! woe is me, that I should have been the cause of bringing the men</a>
<a id='line_6851'>of the Island of the Mighty into so great a strait.  Evil betide me if I</a>
<a id='line_6852'>find not a deliverance therefrom.”  And he cast himself among the dead</a>
<a id='line_6853'>bodies of the Irish, and two unshod Irishmen came to him, and, taking him</a>
<a id='line_6854'>to be one of the Irish, flung him into the cauldron.  And he stretched</a>
<a id='line_6855'>himself out in the cauldron, so that he rent the cauldron into four</a>
<a id='line_6856'>pieces, and burst his own heart also.</a>
<a id='line_6857'></a>
<a id='line_6858'>In consequence of that the men of the Island of the Mighty obtained such</a>
<a id='line_6859'>success as they had; but they were not victorious, for only seven men of</a>
<a id='line_6860'>them all escaped, and Bendigeid Vran himself was wounded in the foot with</a>
<a id='line_6861'>a poisoned dart.  Now the seven men that escaped were Pryderi,</a>
<a id='line_6862'>Manawyddan, Gluneu Eil Taran, Taliesin, Ynawc, Grudyen the son of Muryel,</a>
<a id='line_6863'>and Heilyn the son of Gwynn Hen.</a>
<a id='line_6864'></a>
<a id='line_6865'>And Bendigeid Vran commanded them that they should cut off his head.</a>
<a id='line_6866'>“And take you my head,” said he, “and bear it even unto the White Mount,</a>
<a id='line_6867'>in London, and bury it there, with the face towards France.  And a long</a>
<a id='line_6868'>time will you be upon the road.  In Harlech you will be feasting seven</a>
<a id='line_6869'>years, the birds of Rhiannon singing unto you the while.  And all that</a>
<a id='line_6870'>time the head will be to you as pleasant company as it ever was when on</a>
<a id='line_6871'>my body.  And at Gwales in Penvro you will be fourscore years, and you</a>
<a id='line_6872'>may remain there, and the head with you uncorrupted, until you open the</a>
<a id='line_6873'>door that looks towards Aber Henvelen, and towards Cornwall.  And after</a>
<a id='line_6874'>you have opened that door, there you may no longer tarry, set forth then</a>
<a id='line_6875'>to London to bury the head, and go straight forward.”</a>
<a id='line_6876'></a>
<a id='line_6877'>So they cut off his head, and these seven went forward therewith.  And</a>
<a id='line_6878'>Branwen was the eighth with them, and they came to land at Aber Alaw, in</a>
<a id='line_6879'>Talebolyon, and they sat down to rest.  And Branwen looked towards</a>
<a id='line_6880'>Ireland and towards the Island of the Mighty, to see if she could descry</a>
<a id='line_6881'>them.  “Alas,” said she, “woe is me that I was ever born; two islands</a>
<a id='line_6882'>have been destroyed because of me!”  Then she uttered a loud groan, and</a>
<a id='line_6883'>there broke her heart.  And they made her a four-sided grave, and buried</a>
<a id='line_6884'>her upon the banks of the Alaw.</a>
<a id='line_6885'></a>
<a id='line_6886'>Then the seven men journeyed forward towards Harlech, bearing the head</a>
<a id='line_6887'>with them; and as they went, behold there met them a multitude of men and</a>
<a id='line_6888'>of women.  “Have you any tidings?” asked Manawyddan.  “We have none,”</a>
<a id='line_6889'>said they, “save that Caswallawn the son of Beli has conquered the Island</a>
<a id='line_6890'>of the Mighty, and is crowned king in London.”  “What has become,” said</a>
<a id='line_6891'>they, “of Caradawc the son of Bran, and the seven men who were left with</a>
<a id='line_6892'>him in this island?”  “Caswallawn came upon them, and slew six of the</a>
<a id='line_6893'>men, and Caradawc’s heart broke for grief thereof; for he could see the</a>
<a id='line_6894'>sword that slew the men, but knew not who it was that wielded it.</a>
<a id='line_6895'>Caswallawn had flung upon him the Veil of Illusion, so that no one could</a>
<a id='line_6896'>see him slay the men, but the sword only could they see.  And it liked</a>
<a id='line_6897'>him not to slay Caradawc, because he was his nephew, the son of his</a>
<a id='line_6898'>cousin.  And now he was the third whose heart had broke through grief.</a>
<a id='line_6899'>Pendaran Dyved, who had remained as a young page with these men, escaped</a>
<a id='line_6900'>into the wood,” said they.</a>
<a id='line_6901'></a>
<a id='line_6902'>Then they went on to Harlech, and there stopped to rest, and they</a>
<a id='line_6903'>provided meat and liquor, and sat down to eat and to drink.  And there</a>
<a id='line_6904'>came three birds, and began singing unto them a certain song, and all the</a>
<a id='line_6905'>songs they had ever heard were unpleasant compared thereto; and the birds</a>
<a id='line_6906'>seemed to them to be at a great distance from them over the sea, yet they</a>
<a id='line_6907'>appeared as distinct as if they were close by, and at this repast they</a>
<a id='line_6908'>continued seven years.</a>
<a id='line_6909'></a>
<a id='line_6910'>And at the close of the seventh year they went forth to Gwales in Penvro.</a>
<a id='line_6911'>And there they found a fair and regal spot overlooking the ocean; and a</a>
<a id='line_6912'>spacious hall was therein.  And they went into the hall, and two of its</a>
<a id='line_6913'>doors were open, but the third door was closed, that which looked towards</a>
<a id='line_6914'>Cornwall.  “See, yonder,” said Manawyddan, “is the door that we may not</a>
<a id='line_6915'>open.”  And that night they regaled themselves and were joyful.  And of</a>
<a id='line_6916'>all they had seen of food laid before them, and of all they had heard of,</a>
<a id='line_6917'>they remembered nothing; neither of that, nor of any sorrow whatsoever.</a>
<a id='line_6918'>And there they remained fourscore years, unconscious of having ever spent</a>
<a id='line_6919'>a time more joyous and mirthful.  And they were not more weary than when</a>
<a id='line_6920'>first they came, neither did they, any of them, know the time they had</a>
<a id='line_6921'>been there.  And it was not more irksome to them having the head with</a>
<a id='line_6922'>them, than if Bendigeid Vran had been with them himself.  And because of</a>
<a id='line_6923'>these fourscore years, it was called “the Entertaining of the noble</a>
<a id='line_6924'>Head.”  The entertaining of Branwen and Matholwch was in the time that</a>
<a id='line_6925'>they went to Ireland.</a>
<a id='line_6926'></a>
<a id='line_6927'>One day said Heilyn the son of Gwynn, “Evil betide me, if I do not open</a>
<a id='line_6928'>the door to know if that is true which is said concerning it.”  So he</a>
<a id='line_6929'>opened the door and looked towards Cornwall and Aber Henvelen.  And when</a>
<a id='line_6930'>they had looked, they were as conscious of all the evils they had ever</a>
<a id='line_6931'>sustained, and of all the friends and companions they had lost, and of</a>
<a id='line_6932'>all the misery that had befallen them, as if all had happened in that</a>
<a id='line_6933'>very spot; and especially of the fate of their lord.  And because of</a>
<a id='line_6934'>their perturbation they could not rest, but journeyed forth with the head</a>
<a id='line_6935'>towards London.  And they buried the head in the White Mount, and when it</a>
<a id='line_6936'>was buried, this was the third goodly concealment; and it was the third</a>
<a id='line_6937'>ill-fated disclosure when it was disinterred, inasmuch as no invasion</a>
<a id='line_6938'>from across the sea came to this island while the head was in that</a>
<a id='line_6939'>concealment.</a>
<a id='line_6940'></a>
<a id='line_6941'>And thus is the story related of those who journeyed over from Ireland.</a>
<a id='line_6942'></a>
<a id='line_6943'>In Ireland none were left alive, except five pregnant women in a cave in</a>
<a id='line_6944'>the Irish wilderness; and to these five women in the same night were born</a>
<a id='line_6945'>five sons, whom they nursed until they became grown-up youths.  And they</a>
<a id='line_6946'>thought about wives, and they at the same time desired to possess them,</a>
<a id='line_6947'>and each took a wife of the mothers of their companions, and they</a>
<a id='line_6948'>governed the country and peopled it.</a>
<a id='line_6949'></a>
<a id='line_6950'>And these five divided it amongst them, and because of this partition are</a>
<a id='line_6951'>the five divisions of Ireland still so termed.  And they examined the</a>
<a id='line_6952'>land where the battles had taken place, and they found gold and silver</a>
<a id='line_6953'>until they became wealthy.</a>
<a id='line_6954'></a>
<a id='line_6955'>And thus ends this portion of the Mabinogi, concerning the blow given to</a>
<a id='line_6956'>Branwen, which was the third unhappy blow of this island; and concerning</a>
<a id='line_6957'>the entertainment of Bran, when the hosts of sevenscore countries and ten</a>
<a id='line_6958'>went over to Ireland to revenge the blow given to Branwen; and concerning</a>
<a id='line_6959'>the seven years’ banquet in Harlech, and the singing of the birds of</a>

<a id='line_6966'>MANAWYDDAN THE SON OF LLYR</a>
<a id='line_6967'>HERE IS THE THIRD PORTION OF THE MABINOGI</a>
<a id='line_6968'></a>
<a id='line_6969'></a>
<a id='line_6970'>WHEN the seven men of whom we spoke above had buried the head of</a>
<a id='line_6971'>Bendigeid Vran, in the White Mount an London, with its face towards</a>
<a id='line_6972'>France; Manawyddan gazed upon the town of London, and upon his</a>
<a id='line_6973'>companions, and heaved a great sigh; and much grief and heaviness came</a>
<a id='line_6974'>upon him.  “Alas, Almighty Heaven, woe is me,” he exclaimed, “there is</a>
<a id='line_6975'>none save myself without a resting-place this night.”  “Lord,” said</a>
<a id='line_6976'>Pryderi, “be not so sorrowful.  Thy cousin is king of the Island of the</a>
<a id='line_6977'>Mighty, and though he should do thee wrong, thou hast never been a</a>
<a id='line_6978'>claimant of land or possessions.  Thou art the third disinherited</a>
<a id='line_6979'>prince.”  “Yea,” answered he, “but although this man is my cousin, it</a>
<a id='line_6980'>grieveth me to see any one in the place of my brother Bendigeid Vran,</a>
<a id='line_6981'>neither can I be happy in the same dwelling with him.”  “Wilt thou follow</a>
<a id='line_6982'>the counsel of another?” said Pryderi.  “I stand in need of counsel,” he</a>
<a id='line_6983'>answered, “and what may that counsel be?”  “Seven Cantrevs remain unto</a>
<a id='line_6984'>me,” said Pryderi, “wherein Rhiannon my mother dwells.  I will bestow her</a>
<a id='line_6985'>upon thee and the seven Cantrevs with her, and though thou hadst no</a>
<a id='line_6986'>possessions but those Cantrevs only, thou couldst not have seven Cantrevs</a>
<a id='line_6987'>fairer than they.  Kicva, the daughter of Gwynn Gloyw, is my wife, and</a>
<a id='line_6988'>since the inheritance of the Cantrevs belongs to me, do thou and Rhiannon</a>
<a id='line_6989'>enjoy them, and if thou ever desire any possessions thou wilt take</a>
<a id='line_6990'>these.”  “I do not, Chieftain,” said he; “Heaven reward thee for thy</a>
<a id='line_6991'>friendship.”  “I would show thee the best friendship in the world if thou</a>
<a id='line_6992'>wouldst let me.”  “I will, my friend,” said he, “and Heaven reward thee.</a>
<a id='line_6993'>I will go with thee to seek Rhiannon and to look at thy possessions.”</a>
<a id='line_6994'>“Thou wilt do well,” he answered.  “And I believe that thou didst never</a>
<a id='line_6995'>hear a lady discourse better than she, and when she was in her prime none</a>
<a id='line_6996'>was ever fairer.  Even now her aspect is not uncomely.”</a>
<a id='line_6997'></a>
<a id='line_6998'>They set forth, and, however long the journey, they came at length to</a>
<a id='line_6999'>Dyved, and a feast was prepared for them against their coming to</a>
<a id='line_7000'>Narberth, which Rhiannon and Kicva had provided.  Then began Manawyddan</a>
<a id='line_7001'>and Rhiannon to sit and to talk together, and from their discourse his</a>
<a id='line_7002'>mind and his thoughts became warmed towards her, and he thought in his</a>
<a id='line_7003'>heart he had never beheld any lady more fulfilled of grace and beauty</a>
<a id='line_7004'>than she.  “Pryderi,” said he, “I will that it be as thou didst say.”</a>
<a id='line_7005'>“What saying was that?” asked Rhiannon.  “Lady,” said Pryderi, “I did</a>
<a id='line_7006'>offer thee as a wife to Manawyddan the son of Llyr.”  “By that will I</a>
<a id='line_7007'>gladly abide,” said Rhiannon.  “Right glad am I also,” said Manawyddan;</a>
<a id='line_7008'>“may Heaven reward him who hath shown unto me friendship so perfect as</a>
<a id='line_7009'>this.”</a>
<a id='line_7010'></a>
<a id='line_7011'>And before the feast was over she became his bride.  Said Pryderi, “Tarry</a>
<a id='line_7012'>ye here the rest of the feast, and I will go into Lloegyr to tender my</a>
<a id='line_7013'>homage unto Caswallawn the son of Beli.”  “Lord,” said Rhiannon,</a>
<a id='line_7014'>“Caswallawn is in Kent, thou mayest therefore tarry at the feast, and</a>
<a id='line_7015'>wait until he shall be nearer.”  “We will wait,” he answered.  So they</a>
<a id='line_7016'>finished the feast.  And they began to make the circuit of Dyved, and to</a>
<a id='line_7017'>hunt, and to take their pleasure.  And as they went through the country,</a>
<a id='line_7018'>they had never seen lands more pleasant to live in, nor better hunting</a>
<a id='line_7019'>grounds, nor greater plenty of honey and fish.  And such was the</a>
<a id='line_7020'>friendship between those four, that they would not be parted from each</a>
<a id='line_7021'>other by night nor by day.</a>
<a id='line_7022'></a>
<a id='line_7023'>And in the midst of all this he went to Caswallawn at Oxford, and</a>
<a id='line_7024'>tendered his homage; and honourable was his reception there, and highly</a>
<a id='line_7025'>was he praised for offering his homage.</a>
<a id='line_7026'></a>
<a id='line_7027'>And after his return, Pryderi and Manawyddan feasted and took their ease</a>
<a id='line_7028'>and pleasure.  And they began a feast at Narberth, for it was the chief</a>
<a id='line_7029'>palace; and there originated all honour.  And when they had ended the</a>
<a id='line_7030'>first meal that night, while those who served them ate, they arose and</a>
<a id='line_7031'>went forth, and proceeded all four to the Gorsedd of Narberth, and their</a>
<a id='line_7032'>retinue with them.  And as they sat thus, behold, a peal of thunder, and</a>
<a id='line_7033'>with the violence of the thunderstorm, lo there came a fall of mist, so</a>
<a id='line_7034'>thick that not one of them could see the other.  And after the mist it</a>
<a id='line_7035'>became light all around.  And when they looked towards the place where</a>
<a id='line_7036'>they were wont to see cattle, and herds, and dwellings, they saw nothing</a>
<a id='line_7037'>now, neither house, nor beast, nor smoke, nor fire, nor man, nor</a>
<a id='line_7038'>dwelling; but the houses of the Court empty, and desert, and uninhabited,</a>
<a id='line_7039'>without either man or beast within them.  And truly all their companions</a>
<a id='line_7040'>were lost to them, without their knowing aught of what had befallen them,</a>
<a id='line_7041'>save those four only.</a>
<a id='line_7042'></a>
<a id='line_7043'>“In the name of Heaven,” cried Manawyddan, “where are they of the Court,</a>
<a id='line_7044'>and all my host beside these?  Let us go and see.”  So they came into the</a>
<a id='line_7045'>hall, and there was no man; and they went on to the castle and to the</a>
<a id='line_7046'>sleeping-place, and they saw none; and in the mead-cellar and in the</a>
<a id='line_7047'>kitchen there was nought but desolation.  So they four feasted, and</a>
<a id='line_7048'>hunted, and took their pleasure.  Then they began to go through the land</a>
<a id='line_7049'>and all the possessions that they had, and they visited the houses and</a>
<a id='line_7050'>dwellings, and found nothing but wild beasts.  And when they had consumed</a>
<a id='line_7051'>their feast and all their provisions, they fed upon the prey they killed</a>
<a id='line_7052'>in hunting, and the honey of the wild swarms.  And thus they passed the</a>
<a id='line_7053'>first year pleasantly, and the second; but at the last they began to be</a>
<a id='line_7054'>weary.</a>
<a id='line_7055'></a>
<a id='line_7056'>“Verily,” said Manawyddan, “we must not bide thus.  Let us go into</a>
<a id='line_7057'>Lloegyr, and seek some craft whereby we may gain our support.”  So they</a>
<a id='line_7058'>went into Lloegyr, and came as far as Hereford.  And they betook</a>
<a id='line_7059'>themselves to making saddles.  And Manawyddan began to make housings, and</a>
<a id='line_7060'>he gilded and coloured them with blue enamel, in the manner that he had</a>
<a id='line_7061'>seen it done by Llasar Llaesgywydd.  And he made the blue enamel as it</a>
<a id='line_7062'>was made by the other man.  And therefore is it still called Calch Lasar</a>
<a id='line_7063'>[blue enamel], because Llasar Llaesgywydd had wrought it.</a>
<a id='line_7064'></a>
<a id='line_7065'>And as long as that workmanship could be had of Manawyddan, neither</a>
<a id='line_7066'>saddle nor housing was bought of a saddler throughout all Hereford; till</a>
<a id='line_7067'>at length every one of the saddlers perceived that they were losing much</a>
<a id='line_7068'>of their gain, and that no man bought of them, but him who could not get</a>
<a id='line_7069'>what he sought from Manawyddan.  Then they assembled together, and agreed</a>
<a id='line_7070'>to slay him and his companions.</a>
<a id='line_7071'></a>
<a id='line_7072'>Now they received warning of this, and took counsel whether they should</a>
<a id='line_7073'>leave the city.  “By Heaven,” said Pryderi, “it is not my counsel that we</a>
<a id='line_7074'>should quit the town, but that we should slay these boors.”  “Not so,”</a>
<a id='line_7075'>said Manawyddan, “for if we fight with them, we shall have evil fame, and</a>
<a id='line_7076'>shall be put in prison.  It were better for us to go to another town to</a>
<a id='line_7077'>maintain ourselves.”  So they four went to another city.</a>
<a id='line_7078'></a>
<a id='line_7079'>“What craft shall we take?” said Pryderi.  “We will make shields,” said</a>
<a id='line_7080'>Manawyddan.  “Do we know anything about that craft?” said Pryderi.  “We</a>
<a id='line_7081'>will try,” answered he.  There they began to make shields, and fashioned</a>
<a id='line_7082'>them after the shape of the good shields they had seen; and they</a>
<a id='line_7083'>enamelled they, as them had done the saddles.  And they prospered in that</a>
<a id='line_7084'>place, so that not a shield was asked for in the whole town, but such as</a>
<a id='line_7085'>was had of them.  Rapid therefore was their work, and numberless were the</a>
<a id='line_7086'>shields they made.  But at last they were marked by the craftsmen, who</a>
<a id='line_7087'>came together in haste, and their fellow-townsmen with them, and agreed</a>
<a id='line_7088'>that they should seek to slay them.  But they received warning, and heard</a>
<a id='line_7089'>how the men had resolved on their destruction.  “Pryderi,” said</a>
<a id='line_7090'>Manawyddan, “these men desire to slay us.”  “Let us not endure this from</a>
<a id='line_7091'>these boors, but let us rather fall upon them and slay them.”  “Not so,”</a>
<a id='line_7092'>he answered; “Caswallawn and his men will hear of it, and we shall be</a>
<a id='line_7093'>undone.  Let us go to another town.”  So to another town they went.</a>
<a id='line_7094'></a>
<a id='line_7095'>“What craft shall we take?” said Manawyddan.  “Whatsoever thou wilt that</a>
<a id='line_7096'>we know,” said Pryderi.  “Not so,” he replied, “but let us take to making</a>
<a id='line_7097'>shoes, for there is not courage enough among cordwainers either to fight</a>
<a id='line_7098'>with us or to molest us.”  “I know nothing thereof,” said Pryderi.  “But</a>
<a id='line_7099'>I know,” answered Manawyddan; “and I will teach thee to stitch.  We will</a>
<a id='line_7100'>not attempt to dress the leather, but we will buy it ready dressed and</a>
<a id='line_7101'>will make the shoes from it.”</a>
<a id='line_7102'></a>
<a id='line_7103'>So he began by buying the best cordwal that could be had in the town, and</a>
<a id='line_7104'>none other would he buy except the leather for the soles; and he</a>
<a id='line_7105'>associated himself with the best goldsmith in the town, and caused him to</a>
<a id='line_7106'>make clasps for the shoes, and to gild the clasps, and he marked how it</a>
<a id='line_7107'>was done until he learnt the method.  And therefore was he called one of</a>
<a id='line_7108'>the three makers of Gold Shoes; and, when they could be had from him, not</a>
<a id='line_7109'>a shoe nor hose was bought of any of the cordwainers in the town.  But</a>
<a id='line_7110'>when the cordwainers perceived that their gains were failing (for as</a>
<a id='line_7111'>Manawyddan shaped the work, so Pryderi stitched it), they came together</a>
<a id='line_7112'>and took counsel, and agreed that they would slay them.</a>
<a id='line_7113'></a>
<a id='line_7114'>“Pryderi,” said Manawyddan, “these men are minded to slay us.”</a>
<a id='line_7115'>“Wherefore should we bear this from the boorish thieves?” said Pryderi.</a>
<a id='line_7116'>“Rather let us slay them all.”  “Not so,” said Manawyddan, “we will not</a>
<a id='line_7117'>slay them, neither will we remain in Lloegyr any longer.  Let us set</a>
<a id='line_7118'>forth to Dyved and go to see it.”</a>
<a id='line_7119'></a>
<a id='line_7120'>So they journeyed along until they came to Dyved, and they went forward</a>
<a id='line_7121'>to Narberth.  And there they kindled fire and supported themselves by</a>
<a id='line_7122'>hunting.  And thus they spent a month.  And they gathered their dogs</a>
<a id='line_7123'>around them, and tarried there one year.</a>
<a id='line_7124'></a>
<a id='line_7125'>And one morning Pryderi and Manawyddan rose up to hunt, and they ranged</a>
<a id='line_7126'>their dogs and went forth from the palace.  And some of the dogs ran</a>
<a id='line_7127'>before them and came to a small bush which was near at hand; but as soon</a>
<a id='line_7128'>as they were come to the bush, they hastily drew back and returned to the</a>
<a id='line_7129'>men, their hair bristling up greatly.  “Let us go near to the bush,” said</a>
<a id='line_7130'>Pryderi, “and see what is in it.”  And as they came near, behold, a wild</a>
<a id='line_7131'>boar of a pure white colour rose up from the bush.  Then the dogs, being</a>
<a id='line_7132'>set on by the men, rushed towards him; but he left the bush and fell back</a>
<a id='line_7133'>a little way from the men, and made a stand against the dogs without</a>
<a id='line_7134'>retreating from them, until the men had come near.  And when the men came</a>
<a id='line_7135'>up, he fell back a second time, and betook him to flight.  Then they</a>
<a id='line_7136'>pursued the boar until they beheld a vast and lofty castle, all newly</a>
<a id='line_7137'>built, in a place where they had never before seen either stone or</a>
<a id='line_7138'>building.  And the boar ran swiftly into the castle and the dogs after</a>
<a id='line_7139'>him.  Now when the boar and the dogs had gone into the castle, they began</a>
<a id='line_7140'>to wonder at finding a castle in a place where they had never before seen</a>
<a id='line_7141'>any building whatsoever.  And from the top of the Gorsedd they looked and</a>
<a id='line_7142'>listened for the dogs.  But so long as they were there they heard not one</a>
<a id='line_7143'>of the dogs nor aught concerning them.</a>
<a id='line_7144'></a>
<a id='line_7145'>“Lord,” said Pryderi, “I will go into the castle to get tidings of the</a>
<a id='line_7146'>dogs.”  “Truly,” he replied, “thou wouldst be unwise to go into this</a>
<a id='line_7147'>castle, which thou hast never seen till now.  If thou wouldst follow my</a>
<a id='line_7148'>counsel, thou wouldst not enter therein.  Whosoever has cast a spell over</a>
<a id='line_7149'>this land has caused this castle to be here.”  “Of a truth,” answered</a>
<a id='line_7150'>Pryderi, “I cannot thus give up my dogs.”  And for all the counsel that</a>
<a id='line_7151'>Manawyddan gave him, yet to the castle he went.</a>
<a id='line_7152'></a>
<a id='line_7153'>When he came within the castle, neither man nor beast, nor boar nor dogs,</a>
<a id='line_7154'>nor house nor dwelling saw he within it.  But in the centre of the castle</a>
<a id='line_7155'>floor he beheld a fountain with marble work around it, and on the margin</a>
<a id='line_7156'>of the fountain a golden bowl upon a marble slab, and chains hanging from</a>
<a id='line_7157'>the air, to which he saw no end.</a>
<a id='line_7158'></a>
<a id='line_7159'>And he was greatly pleased with the beauty of the gold, and with the rich</a>
<a id='line_7160'>workmanship of the bowl, and he went up to the bowl and laid hold of it.</a>
<a id='line_7161'>And when he had taken hold of it his hands stuck to the bowl, and his</a>
<a id='line_7162'>feet to the slab on which the howl was placed, and all his joyousness</a>
<a id='line_7163'>forsook him, so that he could not utter a word.  And thus he stood.</a>
<a id='line_7164'></a>
<a id='line_7165'>And Manawyddan waited for him till near the close of the day.  And late</a>
<a id='line_7166'>in the evening, being certain that he should have no tidings of Pryderi</a>
<a id='line_7167'>or of the dogs, he went back to the palace.  And as he entered, Rhiannon</a>
<a id='line_7168'>looked at him.  “Where,” said she, “are thy companion and thy dogs?”</a>
<a id='line_7169'>“Behold,” he answered, “the adventure that has befallen me.”  And he</a>
<a id='line_7170'>related it all unto her.  “An evil companion hast thou been,” said</a>
<a id='line_7171'>Rhiannon, “and a good companion hast thou lost.”  And with that word she</a>
<a id='line_7172'>went out, and proceeded towards the castle according to the direction</a>
<a id='line_7173'>which he gave her.  The gate of the castle she found open.  She was</a>
<a id='line_7174'>nothing daunted, and she went in.  And as she went in, she perceived</a>
<a id='line_7175'>Pryderi laying hold of the bowl, and she went towards him.  “Oh, my</a>
<a id='line_7176'>lord,” said she, “what dust thou do here?”  And she took hold of the bowl</a>
<a id='line_7177'>with him; and as she did so her hands became fast to the bowl, and her</a>
<a id='line_7178'>feet to the slab, and she was not able to utter a word.  And with that,</a>
<a id='line_7179'>as it became night, lo, there came thunder upon them, and a fall of mist,</a>
<a id='line_7180'>and thereupon the castle vanished, and they with it.</a>
<a id='line_7181'></a>
<a id='line_7182'>When Kicva the daughter of Gwynn Gloyw saw that there was no one in the</a>
<a id='line_7183'>palace but herself and Manawyddan, she sorrowed so that she cared not</a>
<a id='line_7184'>whether she lived or died.  And Manawyddan saw this.  “Thou art in the</a>
<a id='line_7185'>wrong,” said he, “if through fear of me thou grievest thus.  I call</a>
<a id='line_7186'>Heaven to witness that thou hast never seen friendship mere pure than</a>
<a id='line_7187'>that which I will bear thee, as long as Heaven will that thou shouldst be</a>
<a id='line_7188'>thus.  I declare to thee that were I in the dawn of youth I would keep my</a>
<a id='line_7189'>faith unto Pryderi, and unto thee also will I keep it.  Be there no fear</a>
<a id='line_7190'>upon thee, therefore,” said he, “for Heaven is my witness that thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_7191'>meet with all the friendship thou canst wish, and that it is in my power</a>
<a id='line_7192'>to show thee, as long as it shall please Heaven to continue us in this</a>
<a id='line_7193'>grief and woe.”  “Heaven reward thee,” she said, “and that is what I</a>
<a id='line_7194'>deemed of thee.”  And the damsel thereupon took courage and was glad.</a>
<a id='line_7195'></a>
<a id='line_7196'>“Truly, lady,” said Manawyddan, “it is not fitting for us to stay here,</a>
<a id='line_7197'>we have lost our dogs, and we cannot get food.  Let us go into Lloegyr;</a>
<a id='line_7198'>it is easiest for us to find support there.”  “Gladly, lord,” said she,</a>
<a id='line_7199'>“we will do so.”  And they set forth together to Lloegyr.</a>
<a id='line_7200'></a>
<a id='line_7201'>“Lord,” said she, “what craft wilt thou follow?  Take up one that is</a>
<a id='line_7202'>seemly.”  “None other will I take,” answered he, “save that of making</a>
<a id='line_7203'>shoes, as I did formerly.”  “Lord,” said she, “such a craft becomes not a</a>
<a id='line_7204'>man so nobly born as thou.”  “By that however will I abide,” said he.</a>
<a id='line_7205'></a>
<a id='line_7206'>So he began his craft, and he made all his work of the finest leather he</a>
<a id='line_7207'>could get in the town, and, as he had done at the other place, he caused</a>
<a id='line_7208'>gilded clasps to be made for the shoes.  And except himself all the</a>
<a id='line_7209'>cordwainers in the town were idle, and without work.  For as long as they</a>
<a id='line_7210'>could be had from him, neither shoes nor hose were bought elsewhere.  And</a>
<a id='line_7211'>thus they tarried there a year, until the cordwainers became envious, and</a>
<a id='line_7212'>took counsel concerning him.  And he had warning thereof, and it was told</a>
<a id='line_7213'>him how the cordwainers had agreed together to slay him.</a>
<a id='line_7214'></a>
<a id='line_7215'>“Lord,” said Kicva, “wherefore should this be borne from these boors?”</a>
<a id='line_7216'>“Nay,” said he, “we will go back unto Dyved.”  So towards Dyved they set</a>
<a id='line_7217'>forth.</a>
<a id='line_7218'></a>
<a id='line_7219'>Now Manawyddan, when he set out to return to Dyved, took with him a</a>
<a id='line_7220'>burden of wheat.  And he proceeded towards Narberth, and there he dwelt.</a>
<a id='line_7221'>And never was he better pleased than when he saw Narberth again, and the</a>
<a id='line_7222'>lands where he had been wont to hunt with Pryderi and with Rhiannon.  And</a>
<a id='line_7223'>he accustomed himself to fish, and to hunt the deer in their covert.  And</a>
<a id='line_7224'>then he began to prepare some ground, and he sowed a croft, and a second,</a>
<a id='line_7225'>and a third.  And no wheat in the world ever sprung up better.  And the</a>
<a id='line_7226'>three crofts prospered with perfect growth, and no man ever saw fairer</a>
<a id='line_7227'>wheat than it.</a>
<a id='line_7228'></a>
<a id='line_7229'>And thus passed the seasons of the year until the harvest came.  And he</a>
<a id='line_7230'>went to look at one of his crofts, and behold it was ripe.  “I will reap</a>
<a id='line_7231'>this to-morrow,” said he.  And that night he went back to Narberth, and</a>
<a id='line_7232'>on the morrow in the grey dawn he went to reap the croft, and when he</a>
<a id='line_7233'>came there he found nothing but the bare straw.  Every one of the ears of</a>
<a id='line_7234'>the wheat was cut from off the stalk, and all the ears carried entirely</a>
<a id='line_7235'>away, and nothing but the straw left.  And at this he marvelled greatly.</a>
<a id='line_7236'></a>
<a id='line_7237'>Then he went to look at another croft, and behold that also was ripe.</a>
<a id='line_7238'>“Verily,” said he, “this will I reap to-morrow.”  And on the morrow he</a>
<a id='line_7239'>came with the intent to reap it, and when he came there he found nothing</a>
<a id='line_7240'>but the bare straw.  “Oh, gracious Heaven,” he exclaimed, “I know that</a>
<a id='line_7241'>whosoever has begun my ruin is completing it, and has also destroyed the</a>
<a id='line_7242'>country with me.”</a>
<a id='line_7243'></a>
<a id='line_7244'>Then he went to look at the third croft, and when he came there, finer</a>
<a id='line_7245'>wheat had there never been seen, and this also was ripe.  “Evil betide</a>
<a id='line_7246'>me,” said he, “if I watch not here to-night.  Whoever carried off the</a>
<a id='line_7247'>other corn will come in like manner to take this.  And I will know who it</a>
<a id='line_7248'>is.”  So he took his arms, and began to watch the croft.  And he told</a>
<a id='line_7249'>Kicva all that had befallen.  “Verily,” said she, “what thinkest thou to</a>
<a id='line_7250'>do?”  “I will watch the croft to-night,” said he.</a>
<a id='line_7251'></a>
<a id='line_7252'>And he went to watch the croft.  And at midnight, lo, there arose the</a>
<a id='line_7253'>loudest tumult in the world.  And he looked, and behold the mightiest</a>
<a id='line_7254'>host of mice in the world, which could neither be numbered nor measured.</a>
<a id='line_7255'>And he knew not what it was until the mice had made their way into the</a>
<a id='line_7256'>croft, and each of them climbing up the straw and bending it down with</a>
<a id='line_7257'>its weight, had cut off one of the ears of wheat, and had carried it</a>
<a id='line_7258'>away, leaving there the stalk, and he saw not a single stalk there that</a>
<a id='line_7259'>had not a mouse to it.  And they all took their way, carrying the ears</a>
<a id='line_7260'>with them.</a>
<a id='line_7261'></a>
<a id='line_7262'>In wrath and anger did he rush upon the mice, but he could no more come</a>
<a id='line_7263'>up with them than if they had been gnats, or birds in the air, except one</a>
<a id='line_7264'>only, which though it was but sluggish, went so fast that a man on foot</a>
<a id='line_7265'>could scarce overtake it.  And after this one he went, and he caught it</a>
<a id='line_7266'>and put it in his glove, and tied up the opening of the glove with a</a>
<a id='line_7267'>string, and kept it with him, and returned to the palace.  Then he came</a>
<a id='line_7268'>to the hall where Kicva was, and he lighted a fire, and hung the glove by</a>
<a id='line_7269'>the string upon a peg.  “What hast thou there, lord?” said Kicva.  “A</a>
<a id='line_7270'>thief,” said he, “that I found robbing me.”  “What kind of thief may it</a>
<a id='line_7271'>be, lord, that thou couldst put into thy glove?” said she.  “Behold I</a>
<a id='line_7272'>will tell thee,” he answered.  Then he showed her how his fields had been</a>
<a id='line_7273'>wasted and destroyed, and how the mice came to the last of the fields in</a>
<a id='line_7274'>his sight.  “And one of them was less nimble than the rest, and is now in</a>
<a id='line_7275'>my glove; to-morrow I will hang it, and before Heaven, if I had them, I</a>
<a id='line_7276'>would hang them all.”  “My lord,” said she, “this is marvellous; but yet</a>
<a id='line_7277'>it would be unseemly for a man of dignity like thee to be hanging such a</a>
<a id='line_7278'>reptile as this.  And if thou doest right, thou wilt not meddle with the</a>
<a id='line_7279'>creature, but wilt let it go.”  “Woe betide me,” said he, “if I would not</a>
<a id='line_7280'>hang them all could I catch them, and such as I have I will hang.”</a>
<a id='line_7281'>“Verily, lord,” said she, “there is no reason that I should succour this</a>
<a id='line_7282'>reptile, except to prevent discredit unto thee.  Do therefore, lord, as</a>
<a id='line_7283'>thou wilt.”  “If I knew of any cause in the world wherefore thou shouldst</a>
<a id='line_7284'>succour it, I would take thy counsel concerning it,” said Manawyddan,</a>
<a id='line_7285'>“but as I know of none, lady, I am minded to destroy it.”  “Do so</a>
<a id='line_7286'>willingly then,” said she.</a>
<a id='line_7287'></a>
<a id='line_7288'>And then he went to the Gorsedd of Narberth, taking the mouse with him.</a>
<a id='line_7289'>And he set up two forks on the highest part of the Gorsedd.  And while he</a>
<a id='line_7290'>was doing this, behold he saw a scholar coming towards him, in old and</a>
<a id='line_7291'>poor and tattered garments.  And it was now seven years since he had seen</a>
<a id='line_7292'>in that place either man or beast, except those four persons who had</a>
<a id='line_7293'>remained together until two of them were lost.</a>
<a id='line_7294'></a>
<a id='line_7295'>“My lord,” said the scholar, “good day to thee.”  “Heaven prosper thee,</a>
<a id='line_7296'>and my greeting be unto thee.  And whence dost thou come, scholar?” asked</a>
<a id='line_7297'>he.  “I come, lord, from singing in Lloegyr; and wherefore dost thou</a>
<a id='line_7298'>inquire?”  “Because for the last seven years,” answered he, “I have seen</a>
<a id='line_7299'>no man here save four secluded persons, and thyself this moment.”</a>
<a id='line_7300'>“Truly, lord,” said he, “I go through this land unto mine own.  And what</a>
<a id='line_7301'>work art thou upon, lord?”  “I am hanging a thief that I caught robbing</a>
<a id='line_7302'>me,” said he.  “What manner of thief is that?” asked the scholar.  “I see</a>
<a id='line_7303'>a creature in thy hand like unto a mouse, and ill does it become a man of</a>
<a id='line_7304'>rank equal to thine to touch a reptile such as this.  Let it go forth</a>
<a id='line_7305'>free.”  “I will not let it go free, by Heaven,” said he; “I caught it</a>
<a id='line_7306'>robbing me, and the doom of a thief will I inflict upon it, and I will</a>
<a id='line_7307'>hang it.”  “Lord,” said he, “rather than see a man of rank equal to thine</a>
<a id='line_7308'>at such a work as this, I would give thee a pound which I have received</a>
<a id='line_7309'>as alms, to let the reptile go forth free.”  “I will not let it go free,”</a>
<a id='line_7310'>said he, “by Heaven, neither will I sell it.”  “As thou wilt, lord,” he</a>
<a id='line_7311'>answered; “except that I would not see a man of rank equal to thine</a>
<a id='line_7312'>touching such a reptile, I care nought.”  And the scholar went his way.</a>
<a id='line_7313'></a>
<a id='line_7314'>And as he was placing the crossbeam upon the two forks, behold a priest</a>
<a id='line_7315'>came towards him upon a horse covered with trappings.  “Good day to thee,</a>
<a id='line_7316'>lord,” said he.  “Heaven prosper thee,” said Manawyddan; “thy blessing.”</a>
<a id='line_7317'>“The blessing of Heaven be upon thee.  And what, lord, art thou doing?”</a>
<a id='line_7318'>“I am hanging a thief that I caught robbing me,” said he.  “What manner</a>
<a id='line_7319'>of thief, lord?” asked he.  “A creature,” he answered, “in form of a</a>
<a id='line_7320'>mouse.  It has been robbing me, and I am inflicting upon it the doom of a</a>
<a id='line_7321'>thief.”  “Lord,” said he, “rather than see thee touch this reptile, I</a>
<a id='line_7322'>would purchase its freedom.”  “By my confession to Heaven, neither will I</a>
<a id='line_7323'>sell it nor set it free.”  “It is true, lord, that it is worth nothing to</a>
<a id='line_7324'>buy; but rather than see thee defile thyself by touching such a reptile</a>
<a id='line_7325'>as this, I will give thee three pounds to let it go.”  “I will not, by</a>
<a id='line_7326'>Heaven,” said he, “take any price for at.  As it ought, so shall it be</a>
<a id='line_7327'>hanged.”  “Willingly, lord, do thy good pleasure.”  And the priest went</a>
<a id='line_7328'>his way.</a>
<a id='line_7329'></a>
<a id='line_7330'>Then he noosed the string around the mouse’s neck, and as he was about to</a>
<a id='line_7331'>draw it up, behold, he saw a bishop’s retinue with his sumpter-horses,</a>
<a id='line_7332'>and his attendants.  And the bishop himself came towards him.  And he</a>
<a id='line_7333'>stayed his work.  “Lord bishop,” said he, “thy blessing.”  “Heaven’s</a>
<a id='line_7334'>blessing be unto thee,” said he; “what work art thou upon?”  “Hanging a</a>
<a id='line_7335'>thief that I caught robbing me,” said he.  “Is not that a mouse that I</a>
<a id='line_7336'>see in thy hand?”  “Yes,” answered he.  “And she has robbed me.”  “Aye,”</a>
<a id='line_7337'>said he, “since I have come at the doom of this reptile, I will ransom it</a>
<a id='line_7338'>of thee.  I will give thee seven pounds for it, and that rather than see</a>
<a id='line_7339'>a man of rank equal to thine destroying so vile a reptile as this.  Let</a>
<a id='line_7340'>it loose and thou shalt have the money.”  “I declare to Heaven that I</a>
<a id='line_7341'>will not set it loose.”  “If thou wilt not loose it for this, I will give</a>
<a id='line_7342'>thee four-and-twenty pounds of ready money to set it free.”  “I will not</a>
<a id='line_7343'>set it free, by Heaven, for as much again,” said he.  “If thou wilt not</a>
<a id='line_7344'>set it free for this, I will give thee all the horses that thou seest in</a>
<a id='line_7345'>this plain, and the seven loads of baggage, and the seven horses that</a>
<a id='line_7346'>they are upon.”  “By Heaven, I will not,” he replied.  “Since for this</a>
<a id='line_7347'>thou wilt not, do so at what price soever thou wilt.”  “I will do so,”</a>
<a id='line_7348'>said he.  “I will that Rhiannon and Pryderi be free,” said he.  “That</a>
<a id='line_7349'>thou shalt have,” he answered.  “Not yet will I loose the mouse, by</a>
<a id='line_7350'>Heaven.”  “What then wouldst thou?”  “That the charm and the illusion be</a>
<a id='line_7351'>removed from the seven Cantrevs of Dyved.”  “This shalt thou have also;</a>
<a id='line_7352'>set therefore the mouse free.”  “I will not set it free, by Heaven,” said</a>
<a id='line_7353'>he.  “I will know who the mouse may be.”  “She is my wife.”  “Even though</a>
<a id='line_7354'>she be, I will not set her free.  Wherefore came she to me?”  “To despoil</a>
<a id='line_7355'>thee,” he answered.  “I am Llwyd the son of Kilcoed, and I cast the charm</a>
<a id='line_7356'>over the seven Cantrevs of Dyved.  And it was to avenge Gwawl the son of</a>
<a id='line_7357'>Clud, from the friendship I had towards him, that I cast the charm.  And</a>
<a id='line_7358'>upon Pryderi did I revenge Gwawl the son of Clud, for the game of Badger</a>
<a id='line_7359'>in the Bag, that Pwyll Pen Annwvyn played upon him, which he did</a>
<a id='line_7360'>unadvisedly in the Court of Heveydd Hên.  And when it was known that thou</a>
<a id='line_7361'>wast come to dwell in the land, my household came and besought me to</a>
<a id='line_7362'>transform them into mice, that they might destroy thy corn.  And it was</a>
<a id='line_7363'>my own household that went the first night.  And the second night also</a>
<a id='line_7364'>they went, and they destroyed thy two crofts.  And the third night came</a>
<a id='line_7365'>unto me my wife and the ladies of the Court, and besought me to transform</a>
<a id='line_7366'>them.  And I transformed them.  Now she is pregnant.  And had she not</a>
<a id='line_7367'>been pregnant thou wouldst not have been able to overtake her; but since</a>
<a id='line_7368'>this has taken place, and she has been caught, I will restore thee</a>
<a id='line_7369'>Pryderi and Rhiannon; and I will take the charm and illusion from off</a>
<a id='line_7370'>Dyved.  I have now told thee who she is.  Set her therefore free.”  “I</a>
<a id='line_7371'>will not set her free, by Heaven,” said he.  “What wilt thou more?” he</a>
<a id='line_7372'>asked.  “I will that there be no more charm upon the seven Cantrevs of</a>
<a id='line_7373'>Dyved, and that none shall be put upon it henceforth.”  “This thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_7374'>have,” said he.  “Now set her free.”  “I will not, by my faith,” he</a>
<a id='line_7375'>answered.  “What wilt thou furthermore?” asked he.  “Behold,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_7376'>“this will I have; that vengeance be never taken for this, either upon</a>
<a id='line_7377'>Pryderi or Rhiannon, or upon me.”  “All this shalt thou have.  And truly</a>
<a id='line_7378'>thou hast done wisely in asking this.  Upon thy head would have lighted</a>
<a id='line_7379'>all this trouble.”  “Yea,” said he, “for fear thereof was it, that I</a>
<a id='line_7380'>required this.”  “Set now my wife at liberty.”  “I will not, by Heaven,”</a>
<a id='line_7381'>said he, “until I see Pryderi and Rhiannon with me free.”  “Behold, here</a>
<a id='line_7382'>they come,” he answered.</a>
<a id='line_7383'></a>
<a id='line_7384'>And thereupon behold Pryderi and Rhiannon.  And he rose up to meet them,</a>
<a id='line_7385'>and greeted them, and sat down beside them.  “Ah, Chieftain, set now my</a>
<a id='line_7386'>wife at liberty,” said the bishop.  “Hast thou not received all thou</a>
<a id='line_7387'>didst ask?”  “I will release her gladly,” said he.  And thereupon he set</a>
<a id='line_7388'>her free.</a>
<a id='line_7389'></a>
<a id='line_7390'>Then Llwyd struck her with a magic wand, and she was changed back into a</a>
<a id='line_7391'>young woman, the fairest ever seen.</a>
<a id='line_7392'></a>
<a id='line_7393'>“Look around upon thy land,” said he, “and then thou wilt see it all</a>
<a id='line_7394'>tilled and peopled, as it was in its best state.”  And he rose up and</a>
<a id='line_7395'>looked forth.  And when he looked he saw all the lands tilled, and full</a>
<a id='line_7396'>of herds and dwellings.  “What bondage,” he inquired, “has there been</a>
<a id='line_7397'>upon Pryderi and Rhiannon?”  “Pryderi has had the knockers of the gate of</a>
<a id='line_7398'>my palace about his neck, and Rhiannon has had the collars of the asses,</a>
<a id='line_7399'>after they have been carrying hay, about her neck.”</a>
<a id='line_7400'></a>
<a id='line_7401'>And such had been their bondage.</a>
<a id='line_7402'></a>
<a id='line_7403'>And by reason of this bondage is this story called the Mabinogi of</a>
<a id='line_7404'>Mynnweir and Mynord.</a>
<a id='line_7405'></a>
<a id='line_7406'>And thus ends this portion of the Mabinogi.</a>
<a id='line_7407'></a>
<a id='line_7408'></a>
<a id='line_7409'></a>
<a id='line_7410'></a>
<a id='line_7411'>MATH THE SON OF MATHONWY</a>
<a id='line_7412'>THIS IS THE FOURTH PORTION OF THE MABINOGI</a>
<a id='line_7413'></a>
<a id='line_7414'></a>
<a id='line_7415'>MATH the son of Mathonwy was lord over Gwynedd, and Pryderi the son of</a>
<a id='line_7416'>Pwyll was lord over the one-and-twenty Cantrevs of the South; and these</a>
<a id='line_7417'>were the seven Cantrevs of Dyved, and the seven Cantrevs of Morganwc, the</a>
<a id='line_7418'>four Cantrevs of Ceredigiawn, and the three of Ystrad Tywi.</a>
<a id='line_7419'></a>
<a id='line_7420'>At that time, Math the son of Mathonwy could not exist unless his feet</a>
<a id='line_7421'>were in the lap of a maiden, except only when he was prevented by the</a>
<a id='line_7422'>tumult of war.  Now the maiden who was with him was Goewin, the daughter</a>
<a id='line_7423'>of Pebin of Dôl Pebin, in Arvon, and she was the fairest maiden of her</a>
<a id='line_7424'>time who was known there.</a>
<a id='line_7425'></a>
<a id='line_7426'>And Math dwelt always at Caer Dathyl, in Arvon, and was not able to go</a>
<a id='line_7427'>the circuit of the land, but Gilvaethwy the son of Don, and Eneyd the son</a>
<a id='line_7428'>of Don, his nephews, the sons of his sisters, with his household, went</a>
<a id='line_7429'>the circuit of the land in his stead.</a>
<a id='line_7430'></a>
<a id='line_7431'>Now the maiden was with Math continually, and Gilvaethwy the son of Don</a>
<a id='line_7432'>set his affections upon her, and loved her so that he knew not what he</a>
<a id='line_7433'>should do because of her, and therefrom behold his hue, and his aspect,</a>
<a id='line_7434'>and his spirits changed for love of her, so that it was not easy to know</a>
<a id='line_7435'>him.</a>
<a id='line_7436'></a>
<a id='line_7437'>One day his brother Gwydion gazed steadfastly upon him.  “Youth,” said</a>
<a id='line_7438'>he, “what aileth thee?”  “Why,” replied he, “what seest thou in me?”  “I</a>
<a id='line_7439'>see,” said he, “that thou hast lost thy aspect and thy hue; what,</a>
<a id='line_7440'>therefore, aileth thee?”  “My lord brother,” he answered, “that which</a>
<a id='line_7441'>aileth me, it will not profit me that I should own to any.”  “What may it</a>
<a id='line_7442'>be, my soul?” said he.  “Thou knowest,” he said, “that Math the son of</a>
<a id='line_7443'>Mathonwy has this property, that if men whisper together, in a tone how</a>
<a id='line_7444'>low soever, if the wind meet it, it becomes known unto him.”  “Yes,” said</a>
<a id='line_7445'>Gwydion, “hold now thy peace, I know thy intent, thou lovest Goewin.”</a>
<a id='line_7446'></a>
<a id='line_7447'>When he found that his brother knew his intent, he gave the heaviest sigh</a>
<a id='line_7448'>in the world.  “Be silent, my soul, and sigh not,” he said.  “It is not</a>
<a id='line_7449'>thereby that thou wilt succeed.  I will cause,” said he, “if it cannot be</a>
<a id='line_7450'>otherwise, the rising of Gwynedd, and Powys, and Deheubarth, to seek the</a>
<a id='line_7451'>maiden.  Be thou of glad cheer therefore, and I will compass it.”</a>
<a id='line_7452'></a>
<a id='line_7453'>So they went unto Math the son of Mathonwy.  “Lord,” said Gwydion, “I</a>
<a id='line_7454'>have heard that there have come to the South some beasts, such as were</a>
<a id='line_7455'>never known in this island before.”  “What are they called?” he asked.</a>
<a id='line_7456'>“Pigs, lord.”  “And what kind of animals are they?”  “They are small</a>
<a id='line_7457'>animals, and their flesh is better than the flesh of oxen.”  “They are</a>
<a id='line_7458'>small, then?”  “And they change their names.  Swine are they now called.”</a>
<a id='line_7459'>“Who owneth them?”  “Pryderi the son of Pwyll; they were sent him from</a>
<a id='line_7460'>Annwvyn, by Arawn the king of Annwvyn, and still they keep that name,</a>
<a id='line_7461'>half hog, half pig.”  “Verily,” asked he, “and by what means may they be</a>
<a id='line_7462'>obtained from him?”  “I will go, lord, as one of twelve, in the guise of</a>
<a id='line_7463'>bards, to seek the swine.”  “But it may be that he will refuse you,” said</a>
<a id='line_7464'>he.  “My journey will not be evil, lord,” said he; “I will not come back</a>
<a id='line_7465'>without the swine.”  “Gladly,” said he, “go thou forward.”</a>
<a id='line_7466'></a>
<a id='line_7467'>So he and Gilvaethwy went, and ten other men with them.  And they came</a>
<a id='line_7468'>into Ceredigiawn, to the place that is now called Rhuddlan Teivi, where</a>
<a id='line_7469'>the palace of Pryderi was.  In the guise of bards they came in, and they</a>
<a id='line_7470'>were received joyfully, and Gwydion was placed beside Pryderi that night.</a>
<a id='line_7471'></a>
<a id='line_7472'>“Of a truth,” said Pryderi, “gladly would I have a tale from some of your</a>
<a id='line_7473'>men yonder.”  “Lord,” said Gwydion, “we have a custom that the first</a>
<a id='line_7474'>night that we come to the Court of a great man, the chief of song</a>
<a id='line_7475'>recites.  Gladly will I relate a tale.”  Now Gwydion was the best teller</a>
<a id='line_7476'>of tales in the world, and he diverted all the Court that night with</a>
<a id='line_7477'>pleasant discourse and with tales, so that he charmed every one in the</a>
<a id='line_7478'>Court, and it pleased Pryderi to talk with him.</a>
<a id='line_7479'></a>
<a id='line_7480'>And after this, “Lord,” said he unto Pryderi, “were it more pleasing to</a>
<a id='line_7481'>thee, that another should discharge my errand unto thee, than that I</a>
<a id='line_7482'>should tell thee myself what it is?”  “No,” he answered, “ample speech</a>
<a id='line_7483'>hast thou.”  “Behold then, lord,” said he, “my errand.  It is to crave</a>
<a id='line_7484'>from thee the animals that were sent thee from Annwvyn.”  “Verily,” he</a>
<a id='line_7485'>replied, “that were the easiest thing in the world to grant, were there</a>
<a id='line_7486'>not a covenant between me and my land concerning them.  And the covenant</a>
<a id='line_7487'>is that they shall not go from me, until they have produced double their</a>
<a id='line_7488'>number in the land.”  “Lord,” said he, “I can set thee free from those</a>
<a id='line_7489'>words, and this is the way I can do so; give me not the swine to-night,</a>
<a id='line_7490'>neither refuse them unto me, and to-morrow I will show thee an exchange</a>
<a id='line_7491'>for them.”</a>
<a id='line_7492'></a>
<a id='line_7493'>And that night he and his fellows went unto their lodging, and they took</a>
<a id='line_7494'>counsel.  “Ah, my men,” said he, “we shall not have the swine for the</a>
<a id='line_7495'>asking.”  “Well,” said they, “how may they be obtained?”  “I will cause</a>
<a id='line_7496'>them to be obtained,” said Gwydion.</a>
<a id='line_7497'></a>
<a id='line_7498'>Then he betook himself to his arts, and began to work a charm.  And he</a>
<a id='line_7499'>caused twelve chargers to appear, and twelve black greyhounds, each of</a>
<a id='line_7500'>them white-breasted, and having upon them twelve collars and twelve</a>
<a id='line_7501'>leashes, such as no one that saw them could know to be other than gold.</a>
<a id='line_7502'>And upon the horses twelve saddles, and every part which should have been</a>
<a id='line_7503'>of iron was entirely of gold, and the bridles were of the same</a>
<a id='line_7504'>workmanship.  And with the horses and the dogs he came to Pryderi.</a>
<a id='line_7505'></a>
<a id='line_7506'>“Good day unto thee, lord,” said he.  “Heaven prosper thee,” said the</a>
<a id='line_7507'>other, “and greetings be unto thee.”  “Lord,” said he, “behold here is a</a>
<a id='line_7508'>release for thee from the word which thou spakest last evening concerning</a>
<a id='line_7509'>the swine; that thou wouldst neither give nor sell them.  Thou mayest</a>
<a id='line_7510'>exchange them for that which is better.  And I will give these twelve</a>
<a id='line_7511'>horses, all caparisoned as they are, with their saddles and their</a>
<a id='line_7512'>bridles, and these twelve greyhounds, with their collars and their</a>
<a id='line_7513'>leashes as thou seest, and the twelve gilded shields that thou beholdest</a>
<a id='line_7514'>yonder.”  Now these he had formed of fungus.  “Well,” said he, “we will</a>
<a id='line_7515'>take counsel.”  And they consulted together, and determined to give the</a>
<a id='line_7516'>swine to Gwydion, and to take his horses and his dogs and his shields.</a>
<a id='line_7517'></a>
<a id='line_7518'>Then Gwydion and his men took their leave, and began to journey forth</a>
<a id='line_7519'>with the pigs.  “Ah, my comrades,” said Gwydion, “it is needful that we</a>
<a id='line_7520'>journey with speed.  The illusion will not last but from the one hour to</a>
<a id='line_7521'>the same to-morrow.”</a>
<a id='line_7522'></a>
<a id='line_7523'>And that night they journeyed as far as the upper part of Ceredigiawn, to</a>
<a id='line_7524'>the place which, from that cause, is called Mochdrev still.  And the next</a>
<a id='line_7525'>day they took their course through Melenydd, and came that night to the</a>
<a id='line_7526'>town which is likewise for that reason called Mochdrev between Keri and</a>
<a id='line_7527'>Arwystli.  And thence they journeyed forward; and that night they came as</a>
<a id='line_7528'>far as that Commot in Powys, which also upon account thereof is called</a>
<a id='line_7529'>Mochnant, and there tarried they that night.  And they journeyed thence</a>
<a id='line_7530'>to the Cantrev of Rhos, and the place where they were that night is still</a>
<a id='line_7531'>called Mochdrev.</a>
<a id='line_7532'></a>
<a id='line_7533'>“My men,” said Gwydion, “we must push forward to the fastnesses of</a>
<a id='line_7534'>Gwynedd with these animals, for there is a gathering of hosts in pursuit</a>
<a id='line_7535'>of us.”  So they journeyed on to the highest town of Arllechwedd, and</a>
<a id='line_7536'>there they made a sty for the swine, and therefore was the name of</a>
<a id='line_7537'>Creuwyryon given to that town.  And after they had made the sty for the</a>
<a id='line_7538'>swine, they proceeded to Math the son of Mathonwy, at Caer Dathyl.  And</a>
<a id='line_7539'>when they came there, the country was rising.  “What news is there here?”</a>
<a id='line_7540'>asked Gwydion.  “Pryderi is assembling one-and-twenty Cantrevs to pursue</a>
<a id='line_7541'>after you,” answered they.  “It is marvellous that you should have</a>
<a id='line_7542'>journeyed so slowly.”  “Where are the animals whereof you went in quest?”</a>
<a id='line_7543'>said Math.  “They have had a sty made for them in the other Cantrev</a>
<a id='line_7544'>below,” said Gwydion.</a>
<a id='line_7545'></a>
<a id='line_7546'>Thereupon, lo, they heard the trumpets and the host in the land, and they</a>
<a id='line_7547'>arrayed themselves and set forward and came to Penardd in Arvon.</a>
<a id='line_7548'></a>
<a id='line_7549'>And at night Gwydion the son of Don, and Gilvaethwy his brother, returned</a>
<a id='line_7550'>to Caer Dathyl; and Gilvaethwy took Math the son of Mathonwy’s couch.</a>
<a id='line_7551'>And while he turned out the other damsels from the room discourteously,</a>
<a id='line_7552'>he made Goewin unwillingly remain.</a>
<a id='line_7553'></a>
<a id='line_7554'>And when they saw the day on the morrow, they went back unto the place</a>
<a id='line_7555'>where Math the son of Mathonwy was with his host; and when they came</a>
<a id='line_7556'>there, the warriors were taking counsel in what district they should</a>
<a id='line_7557'>await the coming of Pryderi, and the men of the South.  So they went in</a>
<a id='line_7558'>to the council.  And it was resolved to wait in the strongholds of</a>
<a id='line_7559'>Gwynedd, in Arvon.  So within the two Maenors they took their stand,</a>
<a id='line_7560'>Maenor Penardd and Maenor Coed Alun.  And there Pryderi attacked them,</a>
<a id='line_7561'>and there the combat took place.  And great was the slaughter on both</a>
<a id='line_7562'>sides; but the men of the South were forced to flee.  And they fled unto</a>
<a id='line_7563'>the place which is still called Nantcall.  And thither did they follow</a>
<a id='line_7564'>them, and they made a vast slaughter of them there, so that they fled</a>
<a id='line_7565'>again as far as the place called Dol Pen Maen, and there they halted and</a>
<a id='line_7566'>sought to make peace.</a>
<a id='line_7567'></a>
<a id='line_7568'>And that he might have peace, Pryderi gave hostages, Gwrgi Gwastra gave</a>
<a id='line_7569'>he and three-and-twenty others, sons of nobles.  And after this they</a>
<a id='line_7570'>journeyed in peace even unto Traeth Mawr; but as they went on together</a>
<a id='line_7571'>towards Melenryd, the men on foot could not be restrained from shooting.</a>
<a id='line_7572'>Pryderi dispatched unto Math an embassy to pray him to forbid his people,</a>
<a id='line_7573'>and to leave it between him and Gwydion the son of Don, for that he had</a>
<a id='line_7574'>caused all this.  And the messengers came to Math.  “Of a truth,” said</a>
<a id='line_7575'>Math, “I call Heaven to witness, if it be pleasing unto Gwydion the son</a>
<a id='line_7576'>of Don, I will so leave it gladly.  Never will I compel any to go to</a>
<a id='line_7577'>fight, but that we ourselves should do our utmost.”</a>
<a id='line_7578'></a>
<a id='line_7579'>“Verily,” said the messengers, “Pryderi saith that it were more fair that</a>
<a id='line_7580'>the man who did him this wrong should oppose his own body to his, and let</a>
<a id='line_7581'>his people remain unscathed.”  “I declare to Heaven, I will not ask the</a>
<a id='line_7582'>men of Gwynedd to fight because of me.  If I am allowed to fight Pryderi</a>
<a id='line_7583'>myself, gladly will I oppose my body to his.”  And this answer they took</a>
<a id='line_7584'>back to Pryderi.  “Truly,” said Pryderi, “I shall require no one to</a>
<a id='line_7585'>demand my rights but myself.”</a>
<a id='line_7586'></a>
<a id='line_7587'>Then these two came forth and armed themselves, and they fought.  And by</a>
<a id='line_7588'>force of strength, and fierceness, and by the magic and charms of</a>
<a id='line_7589'>Gwydion, Pryderi was slain.  And at Maen Tyriawc, above Melenryd, was he</a>
<a id='line_7590'>buried, and there is his grave.</a>
<a id='line_7591'></a>
<a id='line_7592'>And the men of the South set forth in sorrow towards their own land; nor</a>
<a id='line_7593'>is it a marvel that they should grieve, seeing that they had lost their</a>
<a id='line_7594'>lord, and many of their best warriors, and for the most part their horses</a>
<a id='line_7595'>and their arms.</a>
<a id='line_7596'></a>
<a id='line_7597'>The men of Gwynedd went back joyful and in triumph.  “Lord,” said Gwydion</a>
<a id='line_7598'>unto Math, “would it not be right for us to release the hostages of the</a>
<a id='line_7599'>men of the South, which they pledged unto us for peace? for we ought not</a>
<a id='line_7600'>to put them in prison.”  “Let them then be set free,” saith Math.  So</a>
<a id='line_7601'>that youth, and the other hostages that were with him, were set free to</a>
<a id='line_7602'>follow the men of the South.</a>
<a id='line_7603'></a>
<a id='line_7604'>Math himself went forward to Caer Dathyl.  Gilvaethwy the son of Don, and</a>
<a id='line_7605'>they of the household that were with him, went to make the circuit of</a>
<a id='line_7606'>Gwynedd as they were wont, without coming to the Court.  Math went into</a>
<a id='line_7607'>his chamber, and caused a place to be prepared for him whereon to</a>
<a id='line_7608'>recline, so that he might put his feet in the maiden’s lap.  “Lord,” said</a>
<a id='line_7609'>Goewin, “seek now another to hold thy feet, for I am now a wife.”  “What</a>
<a id='line_7610'>meaneth this?” said he.  “An attack, lord, was made unawares upon me; but</a>
<a id='line_7611'>I held not my peace, and there was no one in the Court who knew not of</a>
<a id='line_7612'>it.  Now the attack was made by thy nephews, lord, the sons of thy</a>
<a id='line_7613'>sister, Gwydion the son of Don, and Gilvaethwy the son of Don; unto me</a>
<a id='line_7614'>they did wrong, and unto thee dishonour.”  “Verily,” he exclaimed, “I</a>
<a id='line_7615'>will do to the utmost of my power concerning this matter.  But first I</a>
<a id='line_7616'>will cause thee to have compensation, and then will I have amends made</a>
<a id='line_7617'>unto myself.  As for thee, I will take thee to be my wife, and the</a>
<a id='line_7618'>possession of my dominions will I give unto thy hands.”</a>
<a id='line_7619'></a>
<a id='line_7620'>And Gwydion and Gilvaethwy came not near the Court, but stayed in the</a>
<a id='line_7621'>confines of the land until it was forbidden to give them meat and drink.</a>
<a id='line_7622'>At first they came not near unto Math, but at the last they came.</a>
<a id='line_7623'>“Lord,” said they, “good day to thee.”  “Well,” said he, “is it to make</a>
<a id='line_7624'>me compensation that ye are come?”  “Lord,” they said, “we are at thy</a>
<a id='line_7625'>will.”  “By my will I would not have lost my warriors, and so many arms</a>
<a id='line_7626'>as I have done.  You cannot compensate me my shame, setting aside the</a>
<a id='line_7627'>death of Pryderi.  But since ye come hither to be at my will, I shall</a>
<a id='line_7628'>begin your punishment forthwith.”</a>
<a id='line_7629'></a>
<a id='line_7630'>Then he took his magic wand, and struck Gilvaethwy, so that he became a</a>
<a id='line_7631'>deer, and he seized upon the other hastily lest he should escape from</a>
<a id='line_7632'>him.  And he struck him with the same magic wand, and he became a deer</a>
<a id='line_7633'>also.  “Since now ye are in bonds, I will that ye go forth together and</a>
<a id='line_7634'>be companions, and possess the nature of the animals whose form ye bear.</a>
<a id='line_7635'>And this day twelvemonth come hither unto me.”</a>
<a id='line_7636'></a>
<a id='line_7637'>At the end of a year from that day, lo there was a loud noise under the</a>
<a id='line_7638'>chamber wall, and the barking of the dogs of the palace together with the</a>
<a id='line_7639'>noise.  “Look,” said he, “what is without.”  “Lord,” said one, “I have</a>
<a id='line_7640'>looked; there are there two deer, and a fawn with them.”  Then he arose</a>
<a id='line_7641'>and went out.  And when he came he beheld the three animals.  And he</a>
<a id='line_7642'>lifted up his wand.  “As ye were deer last year, be ye wild hogs each and</a>
<a id='line_7643'>either of you, for the year that is to come.”  And thereupon he struck</a>
<a id='line_7644'>them with the magic wand.  “The young one will I take and cause to be</a>
<a id='line_7645'>baptized.”  Now the name that he gave him was Hydwn.  “Go ye and be wild</a>
<a id='line_7646'>swine, each and either of you, and be ye of the nature of wild swine.</a>
<a id='line_7647'>And this day twelvemonth be ye here under the wall.”</a>
<a id='line_7648'></a>
<a id='line_7649'>At the end of the year the barking of dogs was heard under the wall of</a>
<a id='line_7650'>the chamber.  And the Court assembled, and thereupon he arose and went</a>
<a id='line_7651'>forth, and when he came forth he beheld three beasts.  Now these were the</a>
<a id='line_7652'>beasts that he saw; two wild hogs of the woods, and a well-grown young</a>
<a id='line_7653'>one with them.  And he was very large for his age.  “Truly,” said Math,</a>
<a id='line_7654'>“this one will I take and cause to be baptized.”  And he struck him with</a>
<a id='line_7655'>his magic wand, and he become a fine fair auburn-haired youth, and the</a>
<a id='line_7656'>name that he gave him was Hychdwn.  “Now as for you, as ye were wild hogs</a>
<a id='line_7657'>last year, be ye wolves each and either of you for the year that is to</a>
<a id='line_7658'>come.”  Thereupon he struck them with his magic wand, and they became</a>
<a id='line_7659'>wolves.  “And be ye of like nature with the animals whose semblance ye</a>
<a id='line_7660'>bear, and return here this day twelvemonth beneath this wall.”</a>
<a id='line_7661'></a>
<a id='line_7662'>And at the same day at the end of the year, he heard a clamour and a</a>
<a id='line_7663'>barking of dogs under the wall of the chamber.  And he rose and went</a>
<a id='line_7664'>forth.  And when he came, behold, he saw two wolves, and a strong cub</a>
<a id='line_7665'>with them.  “This one will I take,” said Math, “and I will cause him to</a>
<a id='line_7666'>be baptized; there is a name prepared for him, and that is Bleiddwn.  Now</a>
<a id='line_7667'>these three, such are they:—</a>
<a id='line_7668'></a>
<a id='line_7669'>   The three sons of Gilvaethwy the false,</a>
<a id='line_7670'>   The three faithful combatants,</a>
<a id='line_7671'>   Bleiddwn, Hydwn, and Hychdwn the Tall.”</a>
<a id='line_7672'></a>
<a id='line_7673'>Then he struck the two with his magic wand, and they resumed their own</a>
<a id='line_7674'>nature.  “Oh men,” said he, “for the wrong that ye did unto me sufficient</a>
<a id='line_7675'>has been your punishment and your dishonour.  Prepare now precious</a>
<a id='line_7676'>ointment for these men, and wash their heads, and equip them.”  And this</a>
<a id='line_7677'>was done.</a>
<a id='line_7678'></a>
<a id='line_7679'>And after they were equipped, they came unto him.  “Oh men,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_7680'>“you have obtained peace, and you shall likewise have friendship.  Give</a>
<a id='line_7681'>your counsel unto me, what maiden I shall seek.”  “Lord,” said Gwydion</a>
<a id='line_7682'>the son of Don, “it is easy to give thee counsel; seek Arianrod, the</a>
<a id='line_7683'>daughter of Don, thy niece, thy sister’s daughter.”</a>
<a id='line_7684'></a>
<a id='line_7685'>And they brought her unto him, and the maiden came in.  “Ha, damsel,”</a>
<a id='line_7686'>said he, “art thou the maiden?”  “I know not, lord, other than that I</a>
<a id='line_7687'>am.”  Then he took up his magic wand, and bent it.  “Step over this,”</a>
<a id='line_7688'>said he, “and I shall know if thou art the maiden.”  Then stepped she</a>
<a id='line_7689'>over the magic wand, and there appeared forthwith a fine chubby</a>
<a id='line_7690'>yellow-haired boy.  And at the crying out of the boy, she went towards</a>
<a id='line_7691'>the door.  And thereupon some small form was seen; but before any one</a>
<a id='line_7692'>could get a second glimpse of it, Gwydion had taken it, and had flung a</a>
<a id='line_7693'>scarf of velvet around it and hidden it.  Now the place where he hid it</a>
<a id='line_7694'>was the bottom of a chest at the foot of his bed.</a>
<a id='line_7695'></a>
<a id='line_7696'>“Verily,” said Math the son of Mathonwy, concerning the fine</a>
<a id='line_7697'>yellow-haired boy, “I will cause this one to be baptized, and Dylan is</a>
<a id='line_7698'>the name I will give him.”</a>
<a id='line_7699'></a>
<a id='line_7700'>So they had the boy baptized, and as they baptized him he plunged into</a>
<a id='line_7701'>the sea.  And immediately when he was in the sea, he took its nature, and</a>
<a id='line_7702'>swam as well as the best fish that was therein.  And for that reason was</a>
<a id='line_7703'>he called Dylan, the son of the Wave.  Beneath him no wave ever broke.</a>
<a id='line_7704'>And the blow whereby he came to his death, was struck by his uncle</a>
<a id='line_7705'>Govannon.  The third fatal blow was it called.</a>
<a id='line_7706'></a>
<a id='line_7707'>As Gwydion lay one morning on his bed awake, he heard a cry in the chest</a>
<a id='line_7708'>at his feet; and though it was not loud, it was such that he could hear</a>
<a id='line_7709'>it.  Then he arose in haste, and opened the chest: and when he opened it,</a>
<a id='line_7710'>he beheld an infant boy stretching out his arms from the folds of the</a>
<a id='line_7711'>scarf, and casting it aside.  And he took up the boy in his arms, and</a>
<a id='line_7712'>carried him to a place where he knew there was a woman that could nurse</a>
<a id='line_7713'>him.  And he agreed with the woman that she should take charge of the</a>
<a id='line_7714'>boy.  And that year he was nursed.</a>
<a id='line_7715'></a>
<a id='line_7716'>And at the end of the year he seemed by his size as though he were two</a>
<a id='line_7717'>years old.  And the second year he was a big child, and able to go to the</a>
<a id='line_7718'>Court by himself.  And when he came to the Court, Gwydion noticed him,</a>
<a id='line_7719'>and the boy became familiar with him, and loved him better than any one</a>
<a id='line_7720'>else.  Then was the boy reared at the Court until he was four years old,</a>
<a id='line_7721'>when he was as big as though he had been eight.</a>
<a id='line_7722'></a>
<a id='line_7723'>And one day Gwydion walked forth, and the boy followed him, and he went</a>
<a id='line_7724'>to the Castle of Arianrod, having the boy with him; and when he came into</a>
<a id='line_7725'>the Court, Arianrod arose to meet him, and greeted him and bade him</a>
<a id='line_7726'>welcome.  “Heaven prosper thee,” said he.  “Who is the boy that followeth</a>
<a id='line_7727'>thee?” she asked.  “This youth, he is thy son,” he answered.  “Alas,”</a>
<a id='line_7728'>said she, “what has come unto thee that thou shouldst shame me thus?</a>
<a id='line_7729'>wherefore dost thou seek my dishonour, and retain it so long as this?”</a>
<a id='line_7730'>“Unless thou suffer dishonour greater than that of my bringing up such a</a>
<a id='line_7731'>boy as this, small will be thy disgrace.”  “What is the name of the boy?”</a>
<a id='line_7732'>said she.  “Verily,” he replied, “he has not yet a name.”  “Well,” she</a>
<a id='line_7733'>said, “I lay this destiny upon him, that he shall never have a name until</a>
<a id='line_7734'>he receives one from me.”  “Heaven bears me witness,” answered he, “that</a>
<a id='line_7735'>thou art a wicked woman.  But the boy shall have a name how displeasing</a>
<a id='line_7736'>soever it may be unto thee.  As for thee, that which afflicts thee is</a>
<a id='line_7737'>that thou art no longer called a damsel.”  And thereupon he went forth in</a>
<a id='line_7738'>wrath, and returned to Caer Dathyl and there he tarried that night.</a>
<a id='line_7739'></a>
<a id='line_7740'>And the next day he arose and took the boy with him, and went to walk on</a>
<a id='line_7741'>the seashore between that place and Aber Menei.  And there he saw some</a>
<a id='line_7742'>sedges and seaweed, and he turned them into a boat.  And out of dry</a>
<a id='line_7743'>sticks and sedges he made some Cordovan leather, and a great deal</a>
<a id='line_7744'>thereof, and he coloured it in such a manner that no one ever saw leather</a>
<a id='line_7745'>more beautiful than it.  Then he made a sail to the boat, and he and the</a>
<a id='line_7746'>boy went in it to the port of the castle of Arianrod.  And he began</a>
<a id='line_7747'>forming shoes and stitching them, until he was observed from the castle.</a>
<a id='line_7748'>And when he knew that they of the castle were observing him, he disguised</a>
<a id='line_7749'>his aspect, and put another semblance upon himself, and upon the boy, so</a>
<a id='line_7750'>that they might not be known.  “What men are those in yonder boat?” said</a>
<a id='line_7751'>Arianrod.  “They are cordwainers,” answered they.  “Go and see what kind</a>
<a id='line_7752'>of leather they have, and what kind of work they can do.”</a>
<a id='line_7753'></a>
<a id='line_7754'>So they came unto them.  And when they came he was colouring some</a>
<a id='line_7755'>Cordovan leather, and gilding it.  And the messengers came and told her</a>
<a id='line_7756'>this.  “Well,” said she, “take the measure of my foot, and desire the</a>
<a id='line_7757'>cordwainer to make shoes for me.”  So he made the shoes for her, yet not</a>
<a id='line_7758'>according to the measure, but larger.  The shoes then were brought unto</a>
<a id='line_7759'>her, and behold they were too large.  “These are too large,” said she,</a>
<a id='line_7760'>“but he shall receive their value.  Let him also make some that are</a>
<a id='line_7761'>smaller than they.”  Then he made her others that were much smaller than</a>
<a id='line_7762'>her foot, and sent them unto her.  “Tell him that these will not go on my</a>
<a id='line_7763'>feet,” said she.  And they told him this.  “Verily,” said he, “I will not</a>
<a id='line_7764'>make her any shoes, unless I see her foot.”  And this was told unto her.</a>
<a id='line_7765'>“Truly,” she answered, “I will go unto him.”</a>
<a id='line_7766'></a>
<a id='line_7767'>So she went down to the boat, and when she came there, he was shaping</a>
<a id='line_7768'>shoes and the boy stitching them.  “Ah, lady,” said he, “good day to</a>
<a id='line_7769'>thee.”  “Heaven prosper thee,” said she.  “I marvel that thou canst not</a>
<a id='line_7770'>manage to make shoes according to a measure.”  “I could not,” he replied,</a>
<a id='line_7771'>“but now I shall be able.”</a>
<a id='line_7772'></a>
<a id='line_7773'>Thereupon behold a wren stood upon the deck of the boat, and the boy shot</a>
<a id='line_7774'>at it, and hit it in the leg between the sinew and the bone.  Then she</a>
<a id='line_7775'>smiled.  “Verily,” said she, “with a steady hand did the lion aim at it.”</a>
<a id='line_7776'>“Heaven reward thee not, but now has he got a name.  And a good enough</a>
<a id='line_7777'>name it is.  Llew Llaw Gyffes be he called henceforth.”</a>
<a id='line_7778'></a>
<a id='line_7779'>Then the work disappeared in seaweed and sedges, and he went on with it</a>
<a id='line_7780'>no further.  And for that reason was he called the third Gold-shoemaker.</a>
<a id='line_7781'>“Of a truth,” said she, “thou wilt not thrive the better for doing evil</a>
<a id='line_7782'>unto me.”  “I have done thee no evil yet,” said he.  Then he restored the</a>
<a id='line_7783'>boy to his own form.  “Well,” said she, “I will lay a destiny upon this</a>
<a id='line_7784'>boy, that he shall never have arms and armour until I invest him with</a>
<a id='line_7785'>them.”  “By Heaven,” said he, “let thy malice be what it may, he shall</a>
<a id='line_7786'>have arms.”</a>
<a id='line_7787'></a>
<a id='line_7788'>Then they went towards Dinas Dinllev, and there he brought up Llew Llaw</a>
<a id='line_7789'>Gyffes, until he could manage any horse, and he was perfect in features,</a>
<a id='line_7790'>and strength, and stature.  And then Gwydion saw that he languished</a>
<a id='line_7791'>through the want of horses and arms.  And he called him unto him.  “Ah,</a>
<a id='line_7792'>youth,” said he, “we will go to-morrow on an errand together.  Be</a>
<a id='line_7793'>therefore more cheerful than thou art.”  “That I will,” said the youth.</a>
<a id='line_7794'></a>
<a id='line_7795'>Next morning, at the dawn of day, they arose.  And they took way along</a>
<a id='line_7796'>the sea coast, up towards Bryn Aryen.  And at the top of Cevn Clydno they</a>
<a id='line_7797'>equipped themselves with horses, and went towards the Castle of Arianrod.</a>
<a id='line_7798'>And they changed their form, and pricked towards the gate in the</a>
<a id='line_7799'>semblance of two youths, but the aspect of Gwydion was more staid than</a>
<a id='line_7800'>that of the other.  “Porter,” said he, “go thou in and say that there are</a>
<a id='line_7801'>here bards from Glamorgan.”  And the porter went in.  “The welcome of</a>
<a id='line_7802'>Heaven be unto them, let them in,” said Arianrod.</a>
<a id='line_7803'></a>
<a id='line_7804'>With great joy were they greeted.  And the hall was arranged, and they</a>
<a id='line_7805'>went to meat.  When meat was ended, Arianrod discoursed with Gwydion of</a>
<a id='line_7806'>tales and stories.  Now Gwydion was an excellent teller of tales.  And</a>
<a id='line_7807'>when it was time to leave off feasting, a chamber was prepared for them,</a>
<a id='line_7808'>and they went to rest.</a>
<a id='line_7809'></a>
<a id='line_7810'>In the early twilight Gwydion arose, and he called unto him his magic and</a>
<a id='line_7811'>his power.  And by the time that the day dawned, there resounded through</a>
<a id='line_7812'>the land uproar, and trumpets and shouts.  When it was now day, they</a>
<a id='line_7813'>heard a knocking at the door of the chamber, and therewith Arianrod</a>
<a id='line_7814'>asking that it might be opened.  Up rose the youth and opened unto her,</a>
<a id='line_7815'>and she entered and a maiden with her.  “Ah, good men,” she said, “in</a>
<a id='line_7816'>evil plight are we.”  “Yes, truly,” said Gwydion, “we have heard trumpets</a>
<a id='line_7817'>and shouts; what thinkest thou that they may mean?”  “Verily,” said she,</a>
<a id='line_7818'>“we cannot see the colour of the ocean by reason of all the ships, side</a>
<a id='line_7819'>by side.  And they are making for the land with all the speed they can.</a>
<a id='line_7820'>And what can we do?” said she.  “Lady,” said Gwydion, “there is none</a>
<a id='line_7821'>other counsel than to close the castle upon us, and to defend it as best</a>
<a id='line_7822'>we may.”  “Truly,” said she, “may Heaven reward you.  And do you defend</a>
<a id='line_7823'>it.  And here may you have plenty of arms.”</a>
<a id='line_7824'></a>
<a id='line_7825'>And thereupon went she forth for the arms, and behold she returned, and</a>
<a id='line_7826'>two maidens, and suits of armour for two men, with her.  “Lady,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_7827'>“do you accoutre this stripling, and I will arm myself with the help of</a>
<a id='line_7828'>thy maidens.  Lo, I hear the tumult of the men approaching.”  “I will do</a>
<a id='line_7829'>so, gladly.”  So she armed him fully, and that right cheerfully.  “Hast</a>
<a id='line_7830'>thou finished arming the youth?” said he.  “I have finished,” she</a>
<a id='line_7831'>answered.  “I likewise have finished,” said Gwydion.  “Let us now take</a>
<a id='line_7832'>off our arms, we have no need of them.”  “Wherefore?” said she.  “Here is</a>
<a id='line_7833'>the army around the house.”  “Oh, lady, there is here no army.”  “Oh,”</a>
<a id='line_7834'>cried she, “whence then was this tumult?”  “The tumult was but to break</a>
<a id='line_7835'>thy prophecy and to obtain arms for thy son.  And now has he got arms</a>
<a id='line_7836'>without any thanks unto thee.”  “By Heaven,” said Arianrod, “thou art a</a>
<a id='line_7837'>wicked man.  Many a youth might have lost his life through the uproar</a>
<a id='line_7838'>thou hast caused in this Cantrev to-day.  Now will I lay a destiny upon</a>
<a id='line_7839'>this youth,” she said, “that he shall never have a wife of the race that</a>
<a id='line_7840'>now inhabits this earth.”  “Verily,” said he, “thou wast ever a malicious</a>
<a id='line_7841'>woman, and no one ought to support thee.  A wife shall he have</a>
<a id='line_7842'>notwithstanding.”</a>
<a id='line_7843'></a>
<a id='line_7844'>They went thereupon unto Math the son of Mathonwy, and complained unto</a>
<a id='line_7845'>him most bitterly of Arianrod.  Gwydion showed him also how he had</a>
<a id='line_7846'>procured arms for the youth.  “Well,” said Math, “we will seek, I and</a>
<a id='line_7847'>thou, by charms and illusion, to form a wife for him out of flowers.  He</a>
<a id='line_7848'>has now come to man’s stature, and he is the comeliest youth that was</a>
<a id='line_7849'>ever beheld.”  So they took the blossoms of the oak, and the blossoms of</a>
<a id='line_7850'>the broom, and the blossoms of the meadow-sweet, and produced from them a</a>
<a id='line_7851'>maiden, the fairest and most graceful that man ever saw.  And they</a>
<a id='line_7852'>baptized her, and gave her the name of Blodeuwedd.</a>
<a id='line_7853'></a>
<a id='line_7854'>After she had become his bride, and they had feasted, said Gwydion, “It</a>
<a id='line_7855'>is not easy for a man to maintain himself without possessions.”  “Of a</a>
<a id='line_7856'>truth,” said Math, “I will give the young man the best Cantrev to hold.”</a>
<a id='line_7857'>“Lord,” said he, “what Cantrev is that?”  “The Cantrev of Dinodig,” he</a>
<a id='line_7858'>answered.  Now it is called at this day Eivionydd and Ardudwy.  And the</a>
<a id='line_7859'>place in the Cantrev where he dwelt, was a palace of his in a spot called</a>
<a id='line_7860'>Mur y Castell, on the confines of Ardudwy.  There dwelt he and reigned,</a>
<a id='line_7861'>and both he and his sway were beloved by all.</a>
<a id='line_7862'></a>
<a id='line_7863'>One day he went forth to Caer Dathyl, to visit Math the son of Mathonwy.</a>
<a id='line_7864'>And on the day that he set out for Caer Dathyl, Blodeuwedd walked in the</a>
<a id='line_7865'>Court.  And she heard the sound of a horn.  And after the sound of the</a>
<a id='line_7866'>horn, behold a tired stag went by, with dogs and huntsmen following it.</a>
<a id='line_7867'>And after the dogs and the huntsmen there came a crowd of men on foot.</a>
<a id='line_7868'>“Send a youth,” said she, “to ask who yonder host may be.”  So a youth</a>
<a id='line_7869'>went, and inquired who they were.  “Gronw Pebyr is this, the lord of</a>
<a id='line_7870'>Penllyn,” said they.  And thus the youth told her.</a>
<a id='line_7871'></a>
<a id='line_7872'>Gronw Pebyr pursued the stag, and by the river Cynvael he overtook the</a>
<a id='line_7873'>stag and killed it.  And what with flaying the stag and baiting his dogs,</a>
<a id='line_7874'>he was there until the night began to close in upon him.  And as the day</a>
<a id='line_7875'>departed and the night drew near, he came to the gate of the Court.</a>
<a id='line_7876'>“Verily,” said Blodeuwedd, “the Chieftain will speak ill of us if we let</a>
<a id='line_7877'>him at this hour depart to another land without inviting him in.”  “Yes,</a>
<a id='line_7878'>truly, lady,” said they, “it will be most fitting to invite him.”</a>
<a id='line_7879'></a>
<a id='line_7880'>Then went messengers to meet him and bid him in.  And he accepted her</a>
<a id='line_7881'>bidding gladly, and came to the Court, and Blodeuwedd went to meet him,</a>
<a id='line_7882'>and greeted him, and bade him welcome.  “Lady,” said he, “Heaven repay</a>
<a id='line_7883'>thee thy kindness.”</a>
<a id='line_7884'></a>
<a id='line_7885'>When they had disaccoutred themselves, they went to sit down.  And</a>
<a id='line_7886'>Blodeuwedd looked upon him, and from the moment that she looked on him</a>
<a id='line_7887'>she became filled with his love.  And he gazed on her, and the same</a>
<a id='line_7888'>thought came unto him as unto her, so that he could not conceal from her</a>
<a id='line_7889'>that he loved her, but he declared unto her that he did so.  Thereupon</a>
<a id='line_7890'>she was very joyful.  And all their discourse that night was concerning</a>
<a id='line_7891'>the affection and love which they felt one for the other, and which in no</a>
<a id='line_7892'>longer space than one evening had arisen.  And that evening passed they</a>
<a id='line_7893'>in each other’s company.</a>
<a id='line_7894'></a>
<a id='line_7895'>The next day he sought to depart.  But she said, “I pray thee go not from</a>
<a id='line_7896'>me to-day.”  And that night he tarried also.  And that night they</a>
<a id='line_7897'>consulted by what means they might always be together.  “There is none</a>
<a id='line_7898'>other counsel,” said he, “but that thou strive to learn from Llew Llaw</a>
<a id='line_7899'>Gyffes in what manner he will meet his death.  And this must thou do</a>
<a id='line_7900'>under the semblance of solicitude concerning him.”</a>
<a id='line_7901'></a>
<a id='line_7902'>The next day Gronw sought to depart.  “Verily,” said she, “I will counsel</a>
<a id='line_7903'>thee not to go from me to-day.”  “At thy instance will I not go,” said</a>
<a id='line_7904'>he, “albeit, I must say, there is danger that the chief who owns the</a>
<a id='line_7905'>palace may return home.”  “To-morrow,” answered she, “will I indeed</a>
<a id='line_7906'>permit thee to go forth.”</a>
<a id='line_7907'></a>
<a id='line_7908'>The next day he sought to go, and she hindered him not.  “Be mindful,”</a>
<a id='line_7909'>said Gronw, “of what I have said unto thee, and converse with him fully,</a>
<a id='line_7910'>and that under the guise of the dalliance of love, and find out by what</a>
<a id='line_7911'>means he may come to his death.”</a>
<a id='line_7912'></a>
<a id='line_7913'>That night Llew Llaw Gyffes returned to his home.  And the day they spent</a>
<a id='line_7914'>in discourse, and minstrelsy, and feasting.  And at night they went to</a>
<a id='line_7915'>rest, and he spoke to Blodeuwedd once, and he spoke to her a second time.</a>
<a id='line_7916'>But, for all this, he could not get from her one word.  “What aileth</a>
<a id='line_7917'>thee?” said he, “art thou well?”  “I was thinking,” said she, “of that</a>
<a id='line_7918'>which thou didst never think of concerning me; for I was sorrowful as to</a>
<a id='line_7919'>thy death, lest thou shouldst go sooner than I.”  “Heaven reward thy care</a>
<a id='line_7920'>for me,” said he, “but until Heaven take me I shall not easily be slain.”</a>
<a id='line_7921'>“For the sake of Heaven, and for mine, show me how thou mightest be</a>
<a id='line_7922'>slain.  My memory in guarding is better than thine.”  “I will tell thee</a>
<a id='line_7923'>gladly,” said he.  “Not easily can I be slain, except by a wound.  And</a>
<a id='line_7924'>the spear wherewith I am struck must be a year in the forming.  And</a>
<a id='line_7925'>nothing must be done towards it except during the sacrifice on Sundays.”</a>
<a id='line_7926'>“Is this certain?” asked she.  “It is in truth,” he answered.  “And I</a>
<a id='line_7927'>cannot be slain within a house, nor without.  I cannot be slain on</a>
<a id='line_7928'>horseback nor on foot.”  “Verily,” said she, “in what manner then canst</a>
<a id='line_7929'>thou be slain?”  “I will tell thee,” said he.  “By making a bath for me</a>
<a id='line_7930'>by the side of a river, and by putting a roof over the cauldron, and</a>
<a id='line_7931'>thatching it well and tightly, and bringing a buck, and putting it beside</a>
<a id='line_7932'>the cauldron.  Then if I place one foot on the buck’s back, and the other</a>
<a id='line_7933'>on the edge of the cauldron, whosoever strikes me thus will cause my</a>
<a id='line_7934'>death.”  “Well,” said she, “I thank Heaven that it will be easy to avoid</a>
<a id='line_7935'>this.”</a>
<a id='line_7936'></a>
<a id='line_7937'>No sooner had she held this discourse than she sent to Gronw Pebyr.</a>
<a id='line_7938'>Gronw toiled at making the spear, and that day twelvemonth it was ready.</a>
<a id='line_7939'>And that very day he caused her to be informed thereof.</a>
<a id='line_7940'></a>
<a id='line_7941'>“Lord,” said Blodeuwedd unto Llew, “I have been thinking how it is</a>
<a id='line_7942'>possible that what thou didst tell me formerly can be true; wilt thou</a>
<a id='line_7943'>show me in what manner thou couldst stand at once upon the edge of a</a>
<a id='line_7944'>cauldron and upon a buck, if I prepare the bath for thee?”  “I will show</a>
<a id='line_7945'>thee,” said he.</a>
<a id='line_7946'></a>
<a id='line_7947'>Then she sent unto Gronw, and bade him be in ambush on the hill which is</a>
<a id='line_7948'>now called Bryn Kyvergyr, on the bank of the river Cynvael.  She caused</a>
<a id='line_7949'>also to be collected all the goats that were in the Cantrev, and had them</a>
<a id='line_7950'>brought to the other side of the river, opposite Bryn Kyvergyr.</a>
<a id='line_7951'></a>
<a id='line_7952'>And the next day she spoke thus.  “Lord,” said she, “I have caused the</a>
<a id='line_7953'>roof and the bath to be prepared, and lo! they are ready.”  “Well,” said</a>
<a id='line_7954'>Llew, “we will go gladly to look at them.”</a>
<a id='line_7955'></a>
<a id='line_7956'>The day after they came and looked at the bath.  “Wilt thou go into the</a>
<a id='line_7957'>bath, lord?” said she.  “Willingly will I go in,” he answered.  So into</a>
<a id='line_7958'>the bath he went, and he anointed himself.  “Lord,” said she, “behold the</a>
<a id='line_7959'>animals which thou didst speak of as being called bucks.”  “Well,” said</a>
<a id='line_7960'>he, “cause one of them to be caught and brought here.”  And the buck was</a>
<a id='line_7961'>brought.  Then Llew rose out of the bath, and put on his trowsers, and he</a>
<a id='line_7962'>placed one foot on the edge of the bath and the other on the buck’s back.</a>
<a id='line_7963'></a>
<a id='line_7964'>Thereupon Gronw rose up from the bill which is called Bryn Kyvergyr, and</a>
<a id='line_7965'>he rested on one knee, and flung the poisoned dart and struck him on the</a>
<a id='line_7966'>side, so that the shaft started out, but the head of the dart remained</a>
<a id='line_7967'>in.  Then he flew up in the form of an eagle and gave a fearful scream.</a>
<a id='line_7968'>And thenceforth was he no more seen.</a>
<a id='line_7969'></a>
<a id='line_7970'>As soon as he departed Gronw and Blodeuwedd went together unto the palace</a>
<a id='line_7971'>that night.  And the next day Gronw arose and took possession of Ardudwy.</a>
<a id='line_7972'>And after he had overcome the land, he ruled over it, so that Ardudwy and</a>
<a id='line_7973'>Penllyn were both under his sway.</a>
<a id='line_7974'></a>
<a id='line_7975'>Then these tidings reached Math the son of Mathonwy.  And heaviness and</a>
<a id='line_7976'>grief came upon Math, and much more upon Gwydion than upon him.  “Lord,”</a>
<a id='line_7977'>said Gwydion, “I shall never rest until I have tidings of my nephew.”</a>
<a id='line_7978'>“Verily,” said Math, “may Heaven be thy strength.”  Then Gwydion set</a>
<a id='line_7979'>forth and began to go forward.  And he went through Gwynedd and Powys to</a>
<a id='line_7980'>the confines.  And when he had done so, he went into Arvon, and came to</a>
<a id='line_7981'>the house of a vassal, in Maenawr Penardd.  And he alighted at the house,</a>
<a id='line_7982'>and stayed there that night.  The man of the house and his house-hold</a>
<a id='line_7983'>came in, and last of all came there the swineherd.  Said the man of the</a>
<a id='line_7984'>house to the swineherd, “Well, youth, hath thy sow come in to-night?”</a>
<a id='line_7985'>“She hath,” said he, “and is this instant returned to the pigs.”  “Where</a>
<a id='line_7986'>doth this sow go to?” said Gwydion.  “Every day, when the sty is opened,</a>
<a id='line_7987'>she goeth forth and none can catch sight of her, neither is it known</a>
<a id='line_7988'>whither she goeth more than if she sank into the earth.”  “Wilt thou</a>
<a id='line_7989'>grant unto me,” said Gwydion, “not to open the sty until I am beside the</a>
<a id='line_7990'>sty with thee?”  “This will I do, right gladly,” he answered.</a>
<a id='line_7991'></a>
<a id='line_7992'>That night they went to rest; and as soon as the swineherd saw the light</a>
<a id='line_7993'>of day, he awoke Gwydion.  And Gwydion arose and dressed himself, and</a>
<a id='line_7994'>went with the swineherd, and stood beside the sty.  Then the swineherd</a>
<a id='line_7995'>opened the sty.  And as soon as he opened it, behold she leaped forth,</a>
<a id='line_7996'>and set off with great speed.  And Gwydion followed her, and she went</a>
<a id='line_7997'>against the course of a river, and made for a brook, which is now called</a>
<a id='line_7998'>Nant y Llew.  And there she halted and began feeding.  And Gwydion came</a>
<a id='line_7999'>under the tree, and looked what it might be that the sow was feeding on.</a>
<a id='line_8000'>And he saw that she was eating putrid flesh and vermin.  Then looked he</a>
<a id='line_8001'>up to the top of the tree, and as he looked he beheld on the top of the</a>
<a id='line_8002'>tree an eagle, and when the eagle shook itself, there fell vermin and</a>
<a id='line_8003'>putrid flesh from off it, and these the sow devoured.  And it seemed to</a>
<a id='line_8004'>him that the eagle was Llew.  And he sang an Englyn:—</a>
<a id='line_8005'></a>
<a id='line_8006'>   “Oak that grows between the two banks;</a>
<a id='line_8007'>   Darkened is the sky and hill!</a>
<a id='line_8008'>   Shall I not tell him by his wounds,</a>
<a id='line_8009'>   That this is Llew?”</a>
<a id='line_8010'></a>
<a id='line_8011'>Upon this the eagle came down until he reached the centre of the tree.</a>
<a id='line_8012'>And Gwydion sang another Englyn:—</a>
<a id='line_8013'></a>
<a id='line_8014'>   “Oak that grows in upland ground,</a>
<a id='line_8015'>   Is it not wetted by the rain?  Has it not been drenched</a>
<a id='line_8016'>   By nine score tempests?</a>
<a id='line_8017'>   It bears in its branches Llew Llaw Gyffes!”</a>
<a id='line_8018'></a>
<a id='line_8019'>Then the eagle came down until he was on the lowest branch of the tree,</a>
<a id='line_8020'>and thereupon this Englyn did Gwydion sing:—</a>
<a id='line_8021'></a>
<a id='line_8022'>   “Oak that grows beneath the steep;</a>
<a id='line_8023'>   Stately and majestic is its aspect!</a>
<a id='line_8024'>   Shall I not speak it?</a>
<a id='line_8025'>   That Llew will come to my lap?”</a>
<a id='line_8026'></a>
<a id='line_8027'>And the eagle came down upon Gwydion’s knee.  And Gwydion struck him with</a>
<a id='line_8028'>his magic wand, so that he returned to his own form.  No one ever saw a</a>
<a id='line_8029'>more piteous sight, for he was nothing but skin and bone.</a>
<a id='line_8030'></a>
<a id='line_8031'>Then he went unto Caer Dathyl, and there were brought unto him good</a>
<a id='line_8032'>physicians that were in Gwynedd, and before the end of the year he was</a>
<a id='line_8033'>quite healed.</a>
<a id='line_8034'></a>
<a id='line_8035'>“Lord,” said he unto Math the son of Mathonwy, “it is full time now that</a>
<a id='line_8036'>I have retribution of him by whom I have suffered all this woe.”</a>
<a id='line_8037'>“Truly,” said Math, “he will never be able to maintain himself in the</a>
<a id='line_8038'>possession of that which is thy right.”  “Well,” said Llew, “the sooner I</a>
<a id='line_8039'>have my right, the better shall I be pleased.”</a>
<a id='line_8040'></a>
<a id='line_8041'>Then they called together the whole of Gwynedd, and set forth to Ardudwy.</a>
<a id='line_8042'>And Gwydion went on before and proceeded to Mur y Castell.  And when</a>
<a id='line_8043'>Blodeuwedd heard that he was coming, she took her maidens with her, and</a>
<a id='line_8044'>fled to the mountain.  And they passed through the river Cynvael, and</a>
<a id='line_8045'>went towards a court that there was upon the mountain, and through fear</a>
<a id='line_8046'>they could not proceed except with their faces looking backwards, so that</a>
<a id='line_8047'>unawares they fell into the lake.  And they were all drowned except</a>
<a id='line_8048'>Blodeuwedd herself, and her Gwydion overtook.  And he said unto her, “I</a>
<a id='line_8049'>will not slay thee, but I will do unto thee worse than that.  For I will</a>
<a id='line_8050'>turn thee into a bird; and because of the shame thou hast done unto Llew</a>
<a id='line_8051'>Llaw Gyffes, thou shalt never show thy face in the light of day</a>
<a id='line_8052'>henceforth; and that through fear of all the other birds.  For it shall</a>
<a id='line_8053'>be their nature to attack thee, and to chase thee from wheresoever they</a>
<a id='line_8054'>may find thee.  And thou shalt not lose thy name, but shalt be always</a>
<a id='line_8055'>called Blodeuwedd.”  Now Blodeuwedd is an owl in the language of this</a>
<a id='line_8056'>present time, and for this reason is the owl hateful unto all birds.  And</a>
<a id='line_8057'>even now the owl is called Blodeuwedd.</a>
<a id='line_8058'></a>
<a id='line_8059'>Then Gronw Pebyr withdrew unto Penllyn, and he dispatched thence an</a>
<a id='line_8060'>embassy.  And the messengers he sent asked Llew Llaw Gyffes if he would</a>
<a id='line_8061'>take land, or domain, or gold, or silver, for the injury he had received.</a>
<a id='line_8062'>“I will not, by my confession to Heaven,” said he.  “Behold this is the</a>
<a id='line_8063'>least that I will accept from him; that he come to the spot where I was</a>
<a id='line_8064'>when he wounded me with the dart, and that I stand where he did, and that</a>
<a id='line_8065'>with a dart I take my aim at him.  And this is the very least that I will</a>
<a id='line_8066'>accept.”</a>
<a id='line_8067'></a>
<a id='line_8068'>And this was told unto Gronw Pebyr.  “Verily,” said he, “is it needful</a>
<a id='line_8069'>for me to do thus?  My faithful warriors, and my household, and my</a>
<a id='line_8070'>foster-brothers, is there not one among you who will stand the blow in my</a>
<a id='line_8071'>stead?”  “There is not, verily,” answered they.  And because of their</a>
<a id='line_8072'>refusal to suffer one stroke for their lord, they are called the third</a>
<a id='line_8073'>disloyal tribe even unto this day.  “Well,” said he, “I will meet it.”</a>
<a id='line_8074'></a>
<a id='line_8075'>Then they two went forth to the banks of the river Cynvael, and Gronw</a>
<a id='line_8076'>stood in the place where Llew Llaw Gyffes was when he struck him, and</a>
<a id='line_8077'>Llew in the place where Gronw was.  Then said Gronw Pebyr unto Llew,</a>
<a id='line_8078'>“Since it was through the wiles of a woman that I did unto thee as I have</a>
<a id='line_8079'>done, I adjure thee by Heaven to let me place between me and the blow,</a>
<a id='line_8080'>the slab thou seest yonder on the river’s bank.”  “Verily,” said Llew, “I</a>
<a id='line_8081'>will not refuse thee this.”  “Ah,” said he, “may Heaven reward thee.”  So</a>
<a id='line_8082'>Gronw took the slab and placed it between him and the blow.</a>
<a id='line_8083'></a>
<a id='line_8084'>Then Llew flung the dart at him, and it pierced the slab and went through</a>
<a id='line_8085'>Gronw likewise, so that it pierced through his back.  And thus was Gronw</a>
<a id='line_8086'>Pebyr slain.  And there is still the slab on the bank of the river</a>
<a id='line_8087'>Cynvael, in Ardudwy, having the hole through it.  And therefore is it</a>
<a id='line_8088'>even now called Llech Gronw.</a>
<a id='line_8089'></a>
<a id='line_8090'>A second time did Llew Llaw Gyffes take possession of the land, and</a>
<a id='line_8091'>prosperously did he govern it.  And, as the story relates, he was lord</a>
<a id='line_8092'>after this over Gwynedd.  And thus ends this portion of the Mabinogi.</a>
<a id='line_8093'></a>
<a id='line_8094'></a>
<a id='line_8095'></a>
<a id='line_8096'></a>
<a id='line_8097'>THE DREAM OF MAXEN WLEDIG</a>
<a id='line_8098'></a>
<a id='line_8099'></a>
<a id='line_8100'>MAXEN WLEDIG was emperor of Rome, and he was a comelier man, and a better</a>
<a id='line_8101'>and a wiser than any emperor that had been before him.  And one day he</a>
<a id='line_8102'>held a council of kings, and he said to his friends, “I desire to go</a>
<a id='line_8103'>to-morrow to hunt.”  And the next day in the morning he set forth with</a>
<a id='line_8104'>his retinue, and came to the valley of the river that flowed towards</a>
<a id='line_8105'>Rome.  And he hunted through the valley until mid-day.  And with him also</a>
<a id='line_8106'>were two-and-thirty crowned kings, that were his vassals; not for the</a>
<a id='line_8107'>delight of hunting went the emperor with them, but to put himself on</a>
<a id='line_8108'>equal terms with those kings.</a>
<a id='line_8109'></a>
<a id='line_8110'>And the sun was high in the sky over their heads and the heat was great.</a>
<a id='line_8111'>And sleep came upon Maxen Wledig.  And his attendants stood and set up</a>
<a id='line_8112'>their shields around him upon the shafts of their spears to protect him</a>
<a id='line_8113'>from the sun, and they placed a gold enamelled shield under his head; and</a>
<a id='line_8114'>so Maxen slept.</a>
<a id='line_8115'></a>
<a id='line_8116'>And he saw a dream.  And this is the dream that he saw.  He was</a>
<a id='line_8117'>journeying along the valley of the river towards its source; and he came</a>
<a id='line_8118'>to the highest mountain in the world.  And he thought that the mountain</a>
<a id='line_8119'>was as high as the sky; and when he came over the mountain, it seemed to</a>
<a id='line_8120'>him that he went through the fairest and most level regions that man ever</a>
<a id='line_8121'>yet beheld, on the other side of the mountain.  And he saw large and</a>
<a id='line_8122'>mighty rivers descending from the mountain to the sea, and towards the</a>
<a id='line_8123'>mouths of the rivers he proceeded.  And as he journeyed thus, he came to</a>
<a id='line_8124'>the mouth of the largest river ever seen.  And he beheld a great city at</a>
<a id='line_8125'>the entrance of the river, and a vast castle in the city, and he saw many</a>
<a id='line_8126'>high towers of various colours in the castle.  And he saw a fleet at the</a>
<a id='line_8127'>mouth of the river, the largest ever seen.  And he saw one ship among the</a>
<a id='line_8128'>fleet; larger was it by far, and fairer than all the others.  Of such</a>
<a id='line_8129'>part of the ship as he could see above the water, one plank was gilded</a>
<a id='line_8130'>and the other silvered over.  He saw a bridge of the bone of a whale from</a>
<a id='line_8131'>the ship to the land, and he thought that he went along the bridge, and</a>
<a id='line_8132'>came into the ship.  And a sail was hoisted on the ship, and along the</a>
<a id='line_8133'>sea and the ocean was it borne.  Then it seemed that he came to the</a>
<a id='line_8134'>fairest island in the whole world, and he traversed the island from sea</a>
<a id='line_8135'>to sea, even to the furthest shore of the island.  Valleys he saw, and</a>
<a id='line_8136'>steeps, and rocks of wondrous height, and rugged precipices.  Never yet</a>
<a id='line_8137'>saw he the like.  And thence he beheld an island in the sea, facing this</a>
<a id='line_8138'>rugged land.  And between him and this island was a country of which the</a>
<a id='line_8139'>plain was as large as the sea, the mountain as vast as the wood.  And</a>
<a id='line_8140'>from the mountain he saw a river that flowed through the land and fell</a>
<a id='line_8141'>into the sea.  And at the mouth of the river he beheld a castle, the</a>
<a id='line_8142'>fairest that man ever saw, and the gate of the castle was open, and he</a>
<a id='line_8143'>went into the castle.  And in the castle he saw a fair hall, of which the</a>
<a id='line_8144'>roof seemed to be all gold, the walls of the hall seemed to be entirely</a>
<a id='line_8145'>of glittering precious gems, the doors all seemed to be of gold.  Golden</a>
<a id='line_8146'>seats he saw in the hall, and silver tables.  And on a seat opposite to</a>
<a id='line_8147'>him he beheld two auburn-haired youths playing at chess.  He saw a silver</a>
<a id='line_8148'>board for the chess, and golden pieces thereon.  The garments of the</a>
<a id='line_8149'>youths were of jet-black satin, and chaplets of ruddy gold bound their</a>
<a id='line_8150'>hair, whereon were sparkling jewels of great price, rubies, and gems,</a>
<a id='line_8151'>alternately with imperial stones.  Buskins of new Cordovan leather on</a>
<a id='line_8152'>their feet, fastened by slides of red gold.</a>
<a id='line_8153'></a>
<a id='line_8154'>And beside a pillar in the hall he saw a hoary-headed man, in a chair of</a>
<a id='line_8155'>ivory, with the figures of two eagles of ruddy gold thereon.  Bracelets</a>
<a id='line_8156'>of gold were upon his arms, and many rings were on his hands, and a</a>
<a id='line_8157'>golden torque about his neck; and his hair was bound with a golden</a>
<a id='line_8158'>diadem.  He was of powerful aspect.  A chessboard of gold was before him,</a>
<a id='line_8159'>and a rod of gold, and a steel file in his hand.  And he was carving out</a>
<a id='line_8160'>chessmen.</a>
<a id='line_8161'></a>
<a id='line_8162'>And he saw a maiden sitting before him in a chair of ruddy gold.  Not</a>
<a id='line_8163'>more easy than to gaze upon the sun when brightest, was it to look upon</a>
<a id='line_8164'>her by reason of her beauty.  A vest of white silk was upon the maiden,</a>
<a id='line_8165'>with clasps of red gold at the breast; and a surcoat of gold tissue upon</a>
<a id='line_8166'>her, and a frontlet of red gold upon her head, and rubies and gems were</a>
<a id='line_8167'>in the frontlet, alternating with pearls and imperial stones.  And a</a>
<a id='line_8168'>girdle of ruddy gold was around her.  She was the fairest sight that man</a>
<a id='line_8169'>ever beheld.</a>
<a id='line_8170'></a>
<a id='line_8171'>The maiden arose from her chair before him, and he threw his arms about</a>
<a id='line_8172'>the neck of the maiden, and they two sat down together in the chair of</a>
<a id='line_8173'>gold: and the chair was not less roomy for them both, than for the maiden</a>
<a id='line_8174'>alone.  And as he had his arms about the maiden’s neck, and his cheek by</a>
<a id='line_8175'>her cheek, behold, through the chafing of the dogs at their leashing, and</a>
<a id='line_8176'>the clashing of the shields as they struck against each other, and the</a>
<a id='line_8177'>beating together of the shafts of the spears, and the neighing of the</a>
<a id='line_8178'>horses and their prancing, the emperor awoke.</a>
<a id='line_8179'></a>
<a id='line_8180'>And when he awoke, nor spirit nor existence was left him, because of the</a>
<a id='line_8181'>maiden whom he had seen in his sleep, for the love of the maiden pervaded</a>
<a id='line_8182'>his whole frame.  Then his household spake unto him.  “Lord,” said they,</a>
<a id='line_8183'>“is it not past the time for thee to take thy food?”  Thereupon the</a>
<a id='line_8184'>emperor mounted his palfrey, the saddest man that mortal ever saw, and</a>
<a id='line_8185'>went forth towards Rome.</a>
<a id='line_8186'></a>
<a id='line_8187'>And thus he was during the space of a week.  When they of the household</a>
<a id='line_8188'>went to drink wine and mead out of golden vessels, he went not with any</a>
<a id='line_8189'>of them.  When they went to listen to songs and tales, he went not with</a>
<a id='line_8190'>them there; neither could he be persuaded to do anything but sleep.  And</a>
<a id='line_8191'>as often as he slept, he beheld in his dreams the maiden he loved best;</a>
<a id='line_8192'>but except when he slept he saw nothing of her, for he knew not where in</a>
<a id='line_8193'>the world she was.</a>
<a id='line_8194'></a>
<a id='line_8195'>One day the page of the chamber spake unto him; now, although he was page</a>
<a id='line_8196'>of the chamber, he was king of the Romans.  “Lord,” said he, “all the</a>
<a id='line_8197'>people revile thee.”  “Wherefore do they revile me?” asked the emperor.</a>
<a id='line_8198'>“Because they can get neither message nor answer from thee as men should</a>
<a id='line_8199'>have from their lord.  This is the cause why thou art spoken evil of.”</a>
<a id='line_8200'>“Youth,” said the emperor, “do thou bring unto me the wise men of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_8201'>and I will tell them wherefore I am sorrowful.”</a>
<a id='line_8202'></a>
<a id='line_8203'>Then the wise men of Rome were brought to the emperor, and he spake to</a>
<a id='line_8204'>them.  “Sages of Rome,” said he, “I have seen a dream.  And in the dream</a>
<a id='line_8205'>I beheld a maiden, and because of the maiden is there neither life, nor</a>
<a id='line_8206'>spirit, nor existence within me.”  “Lord,” they answered, “since thou</a>
<a id='line_8207'>judgest us worthy to counsel thee, we will give thee counsel.  And this</a>
<a id='line_8208'>is our counsel; that thou send messengers for three years to the three</a>
<a id='line_8209'>parts of the world to seek for thy dream.  And as thou knowest not what</a>
<a id='line_8210'>day or what night good news may come to thee, the hope thereof will</a>
<a id='line_8211'>support thee.”</a>
<a id='line_8212'></a>
<a id='line_8213'>So the messengers journeyed for the space of a year, wandering about the</a>
<a id='line_8214'>world, and seeking tidings concerning his dream.  But when they came back</a>
<a id='line_8215'>at the end of the year, they knew not one word more than they did the day</a>
<a id='line_8216'>they set forth.  And then was the emperor exceeding sorrowful, for he</a>
<a id='line_8217'>thought that he should never have tidings of her whom best he loved.</a>
<a id='line_8218'></a>
<a id='line_8219'>Then spoke the king of the Romans unto the emperor.  “Lord,” said he, “go</a>
<a id='line_8220'>forth to hunt by the way thou didst seem to go, whether it were to the</a>
<a id='line_8221'>east, or to the west.”  So the emperor went forth to the hunt, and he</a>
<a id='line_8222'>came to the bank of the river.  “Behold,” said he, “this is where I was</a>
<a id='line_8223'>when I saw the dream, and I went towards the source of the river</a>
<a id='line_8224'>westward.”</a>
<a id='line_8225'></a>
<a id='line_8226'>And thereupon thirteen messengers of the emperor’s set forth, and before</a>
<a id='line_8227'>them they saw a high mountain, which seemed to them to touch the sky.</a>
<a id='line_8228'>Now this was the guise in which the messengers journeyed; one sleeve was</a>
<a id='line_8229'>on the cap of each of them in front, as a sign that they were messengers,</a>
<a id='line_8230'>in order that through what hostile land soever they might pass no harm</a>
<a id='line_8231'>might be done them.  And when they were come over this mountain, they</a>
<a id='line_8232'>beheld vast plains, and large rivers flowing there through.</a>
<a id='line_8233'></a>
<a id='line_8234'>“Behold,” said they, “the land which our master saw.”</a>
<a id='line_8235'></a>
<a id='line_8236'>And they went along the mouths of the rivers, until they came to the</a>
<a id='line_8237'>mighty river which they saw flowing to the sea, and the vast city, and</a>
<a id='line_8238'>the many-coloured high towers in the castle.  They saw the largest fleet</a>
<a id='line_8239'>in the world, in the harbour of the river, and one ship that was larger</a>
<a id='line_8240'>than any of the others.  “Behold again,” said they, “the dream that our</a>
<a id='line_8241'>master saw.”  And in the great ship they crossed the sea, and came to the</a>
<a id='line_8242'>Island of Britain.  And they traversed the island until they came to</a>
<a id='line_8243'>Snowdon.  “Behold,” said they, “the rugged land that our master saw.”</a>
<a id='line_8244'>And they went forward until they saw Anglesey before them, and until they</a>
<a id='line_8245'>saw Arvon likewise.  “Behold,” said they, “the land our master saw in his</a>
<a id='line_8246'>sleep.”  And they saw Aber Sain, and a castle at the mouth of the river.</a>
<a id='line_8247'>The portal of the castle saw they open, and into the castle they went,</a>
<a id='line_8248'>and they saw a hall in the castle.  Then said they, “Behold, the hall</a>
<a id='line_8249'>which he saw in his sleep.”  They went into the hall, and they beheld two</a>
<a id='line_8250'>youths playing at chess on the golden bench.  And they beheld the</a>
<a id='line_8251'>hoary-headed man beside the pillar, in the ivory chair, carving chessmen.</a>
<a id='line_8252'>And they beheld the maiden sitting on a chair of ruddy gold.</a>
<a id='line_8253'></a>
<a id='line_8254'>The messengers bent down upon their knees.  “Empress of Rome, all hail!”</a>
<a id='line_8255'>“Ha, gentles,” said the maiden, “ye bear the seeming of honourable men,</a>
<a id='line_8256'>and the badge of envoys, what mockery is this ye do to me?”  “We mock</a>
<a id='line_8257'>thee not, lady; but the Emperor of Rome hath seen thee in his sleep, and</a>
<a id='line_8258'>he has neither life nor spirit left because of thee.  Thou shalt have of</a>
<a id='line_8259'>us therefore the choice, lady, whether thou wilt go with us and be made</a>
<a id='line_8260'>empress of Rome, or that the emperor come hither and take thee for his</a>
<a id='line_8261'>wife?”  “Ha, lords,” said the maiden, “I will not deny what ye say,</a>
<a id='line_8262'>neither will I believe it too well.  If the emperor love me, let him come</a>
<a id='line_8263'>here to seek me.”</a>
<a id='line_8264'></a>
<a id='line_8265'>And by day and night the messengers hied them back.  And when their</a>
<a id='line_8266'>horses failed, they bought other fresh ones.  And when they came to Rome,</a>
<a id='line_8267'>they saluted the emperor, and asked their boon, which was given to them</a>
<a id='line_8268'>according as they named it.  “We will be thy guides, lord,” said they,</a>
<a id='line_8269'>“over sea and over land, to the place where is the woman whom best thou</a>
<a id='line_8270'>lovest, for we know her name, and her kindred, and her race.”</a>
<a id='line_8271'></a>
<a id='line_8272'>And immediately the emperor set forth with his army.  And these men were</a>
<a id='line_8273'>his guides.  Towards the Island of Britain they went over the sea and the</a>
<a id='line_8274'>deep.  And he conquered the Island from Beli the son of Manogan, and his</a>
<a id='line_8275'>sons, and drove them to the sea, and went forward even unto Arvon.  And</a>
<a id='line_8276'>the emperor knew the land when he saw it.  And when he beheld the castle</a>
<a id='line_8277'>of Aber Sain, “Look yonder,” said he, “there is the castle wherein I saw</a>
<a id='line_8278'>the damsel whom I best love.”  And he went forward into the castle and</a>
<a id='line_8279'>into the hall, and there he saw Kynan the son of Eudav, and Adeon the son</a>
<a id='line_8280'>of Eudav, playing at chess.  And he saw Eudav the son of Caradawc,</a>
<a id='line_8281'>sitting on a chair of ivory carving chessmen.  And the maiden whom he had</a>
<a id='line_8282'>beheld in his sleep, he saw sitting on a chair of gold.  “Empress of</a>
<a id='line_8283'>Rome,” said he, “all hail!”  And the emperor threw his arms about her</a>
<a id='line_8284'>neck; and that night she became his bride.</a>
<a id='line_8285'></a>
<a id='line_8286'>And the next day in the morning, the damsel asked her maiden portion.</a>
<a id='line_8287'>And he told her to name what she would.  And she asked to have the Island</a>
<a id='line_8288'>of Britain for her father, from the Channel to the Irish Sea, together</a>
<a id='line_8289'>with the three adjacent Islands, to hold under the empress of Rome; and</a>
<a id='line_8290'>to have three chief castles made for her, an whatever places she might</a>
<a id='line_8291'>choose in the Island of Britain.  And she chose to have the highest</a>
<a id='line_8292'>castle made at Arvon.  And they brought thither earth from Rome that it</a>
<a id='line_8293'>might be more healthful for the emperor to sleep, and sit, and walk upon.</a>
<a id='line_8294'>After that the two other castles were made for her, which were Caerlleon</a>
<a id='line_8295'>and Caermarthen.</a>
<a id='line_8296'></a>
<a id='line_8297'>And one day the emperor went to hunt at Caermarthen, and he came so far</a>
<a id='line_8298'>as the top of Brevi Vawr, and there the emperor pitched his tent.  And</a>
<a id='line_8299'>that encamping place is called Cadeir Maxen, even to this day.  And</a>
<a id='line_8300'>because that he built the castle with a myriad of men, he called it</a>
<a id='line_8301'>Caervyrddin.  Then Helen bethought her to make high roads from one castle</a>
<a id='line_8302'>to another throughout the Island of Britain.  And the roads were made.</a>
<a id='line_8303'>And for this cause are they called the roads of Helen Luyddawc, that she</a>
<a id='line_8304'>was sprung from a native of this island, and the men of the Island of</a>
<a id='line_8305'>Britain would not have made these great roads for any save for her.</a>
<a id='line_8306'></a>
<a id='line_8307'>Seven years did the emperor tarry in this Island.  Now, at that time, the</a>
<a id='line_8308'>men of Rome had a custom, that whatsoever emperor should remain in other</a>
<a id='line_8309'>lands more than seven years should remain to his own overthrow, and</a>
<a id='line_8310'>should never return to Rome again.</a>
<a id='line_8311'></a>
<a id='line_8312'>So they made a new emperor.  And this one wrote a letter of threat to</a>
<a id='line_8313'>Maxen.  There was nought in the letter but only this.  “If thou comest,</a>
<a id='line_8314'>and if thou ever comest to Rome.”  And even unto Caerlleon came this</a>
<a id='line_8315'>letter to Maxen, and these tidings.  Then sent he a letter to the man who</a>
<a id='line_8316'>styled himself emperor in Rome.  There was nought in that letter also but</a>
<a id='line_8317'>only this.  “If I come to Rome, and if I come.”</a>
<a id='line_8318'></a>
<a id='line_8319'>And thereupon Maxen set forth towards Rome with his army, and vanquished</a>
<a id='line_8320'>France and Bugundy, and every land on the way, and sat down before the</a>
<a id='line_8321'>city of Rome.</a>
<a id='line_8322'></a>
<a id='line_8323'>A year was the emperor before the city, and he was no nearer taking it</a>
<a id='line_8324'>than the first day.  And after him there came the brothers of Helen</a>
<a id='line_8325'>Luyddawc from the Island of Britain, and a small host with them, and</a>
<a id='line_8326'>better warriors were in that small host than twice as many Romans.  And</a>
<a id='line_8327'>the emperor was told that a host was seen, halting close to his army and</a>
<a id='line_8328'>encamping, and no man ever saw a fairer or better appointed host for its</a>
<a id='line_8329'>size, nor more handsome standards.</a>
<a id='line_8330'></a>
<a id='line_8331'>And Helen went to see the hosts, and she knew the standards of her</a>
<a id='line_8332'>brothers.  Then came Kynan the son of Eudav, and Adeon the son of Eudav,</a>
<a id='line_8333'>to meet the emperor.  And the emperor was glad because of them, and</a>
<a id='line_8334'>embraced them.</a>
<a id='line_8335'></a>
<a id='line_8336'>Then they looked at the Romans as they attacked the city.  Said Kynan to</a>
<a id='line_8337'>his brother, “We will try to attack the city more expertly than this.”</a>
<a id='line_8338'>So they measured by night the height of the wall, and they sent their</a>
<a id='line_8339'>carpenters to the wood, and a ladder was made for every four men of their</a>
<a id='line_8340'>number.  Now when these were ready, every day at mid-day the emperors</a>
<a id='line_8341'>went to meat, and they ceased to fight on both sides till all had</a>
<a id='line_8342'>finished eating.  And in the morning the men of Britain took their food</a>
<a id='line_8343'>and they drank until they were invigorated.  And while the two emperors</a>
<a id='line_8344'>were at meat, the Britons came to the city, and placed their ladders</a>
<a id='line_8345'>against it, and forthwith they came in through the city.</a>
<a id='line_8346'></a>
<a id='line_8347'>The new emperor had no time to arm himself when they fell upon him, and</a>
<a id='line_8348'>slew him, and many others with him.  And three nights and three days were</a>
<a id='line_8349'>they subduing the men that were in the city and taking the castle.  And</a>
<a id='line_8350'>others of them kept the city, lest any of the host of Maxen should come</a>
<a id='line_8351'>therein, until they had subjected all to their will.</a>
<a id='line_8352'></a>
<a id='line_8353'>Then spake Maxen to Helen Luyddawc.  “I marvel, lady,” said he, “that thy</a>
<a id='line_8354'>brothers have not conquered this city for me.”  “Lord, emperor,” she</a>
<a id='line_8355'>answered, “the wisest youths in the world are my brothers.  Go thou</a>
<a id='line_8356'>thither and ask the city of them, and if it be in their possession thou</a>
<a id='line_8357'>shalt have it gladly.”  So the emperor and Helen went and demanded the</a>
<a id='line_8358'>city.  And they told the emperor that none had taken the city, and that</a>
<a id='line_8359'>none could give it him, but the men of the Island of Britain.  Then the</a>
<a id='line_8360'>gates of the city of Rome were opened, and the emperor sat on the throne,</a>
<a id='line_8361'>and all the men of Rome submitted them selves unto him.</a>
<a id='line_8362'></a>
<a id='line_8363'>The emperor then said unto Kynan and Adeon, “Lords,” said he, “I have now</a>
<a id='line_8364'>had possession of the whole of my empire.  This host give I unto you to</a>
<a id='line_8365'>vanquish whatever region ye may desire in the world.”</a>
<a id='line_8366'></a>
<a id='line_8367'>So they set forth and conquered lands, and castles, and cities.  And they</a>
<a id='line_8368'>slew all the men, but the women they kept alive.  And thus they continued</a>
<a id='line_8369'>until the young men that had come with them were grown grey-headed, from</a>
<a id='line_8370'>the length of time they were upon this conquest.</a>
<a id='line_8371'></a>
<a id='line_8372'>Then spoke Kynan unto Adeon his brother, “Whether wilt thou rather,” said</a>
<a id='line_8373'>he, “tarry in this land, or go back into the land whence thou didst come</a>
<a id='line_8374'>forth?”  Now he chose to go back to his own land, and many with him.  But</a>
<a id='line_8375'>Kynan tarried there with the other part and dwelt there.</a>
<a id='line_8376'></a>
<a id='line_8377'>And they took counsel and cut out the tongues of the women, lest they</a>
<a id='line_8378'>should corrupt their speech.  And because of the silence of the women</a>
<a id='line_8379'>from their own speech, the men of Armorica are called Britons.  From that</a>
<a id='line_8380'>time there came frequently, and still comes, that language from the</a>
<a id='line_8381'>Island of Britain.</a>
<a id='line_8382'></a>
<a id='line_8383'>And this dream is called the Dream of Maxen Wledig, emperor of Rome.  And</a>
<a id='line_8384'>here it ends.</a>
<a id='line_8385'></a>
<a id='line_8386'></a>
<a id='line_8387'></a>
<a id='line_8388'></a>
<a id='line_8389'>HERE IS THE STORY OF LLUDD AND LLEVELYS</a>
<a id='line_8390'></a>
<a id='line_8391'></a>
<a id='line_8392'>BELI THE GREAT, the son of Manogan, had three sons, Lludd, and</a>
<a id='line_8393'>Caswallawn, and Nynyaw; and according to the story he had a fourth son</a>
<a id='line_8394'>called Llevelys.  And after the death of Beli, the kingdom of the Island</a>
<a id='line_8395'>of Britain fell into the hands of Llud his eldest son; and Lludd ruled</a>
<a id='line_8396'>prosperously, and rebuilt the walls of London, and encompassed it about</a>
<a id='line_8397'>with numberless towers.  And after that he bade the citizens build houses</a>
<a id='line_8398'>therein, such as no houses in the kingdoms could equal.  And moreover he</a>
<a id='line_8399'>was a mighty warrior, and generous and liberal in giving meat and drink</a>
<a id='line_8400'>to all that sought them.  And though he had many castles and cities this</a>
<a id='line_8401'>one loved he more than any.  And he dwelt therein most part of the year,</a>
<a id='line_8402'>and therefore was it called Caer Lludd, and at last Caer London.  And</a>
<a id='line_8403'>after the stranger-race came there, it was called London, or Lwndrys.</a>
<a id='line_8404'></a>
<a id='line_8405'>Lludd loved Llevelys best of all his brothers, because he was a wise and</a>
<a id='line_8406'>discreet man.  Having heard that the king of France had died, leaving no</a>
<a id='line_8407'>heir except a daughter, and that he had left all his possessions in her</a>
<a id='line_8408'>hands, he came to Lludd his brother, to beseech his counsel and aid.  And</a>
<a id='line_8409'>that not so much for his own welfare, as to seek to add to the glory and</a>
<a id='line_8410'>honour and dignity of his kindred, if he might go to France to woo the</a>
<a id='line_8411'>maiden for his wife.  And forthwith his brother conferred with him, and</a>
<a id='line_8412'>this counsel was pleasing unto him.</a>
<a id='line_8413'></a>
<a id='line_8414'>So he prepared ships and filled them with armed knights, and set forth</a>
<a id='line_8415'>towards France.  And as soon as they had landed, they sent messengers to</a>
<a id='line_8416'>show the nobles of France the cause of the embassy.  And by the joint</a>
<a id='line_8417'>counsel of the nobles of France and of the princes, the maiden was given</a>
<a id='line_8418'>to Llevelys, and the crown of the kingdom with her.  And thenceforth he</a>
<a id='line_8419'>ruled the land discreetly, and wisely, and happily, as long as his life</a>
<a id='line_8420'>lasted.</a>
<a id='line_8421'></a>
<a id='line_8422'>After a space of time had passed, three plagues fell on the Island of</a>
<a id='line_8423'>Britain, such as none in the islands had ever seen the like of.  The</a>
<a id='line_8424'>first was a certain race that came, and was called the Coranians; and so</a>
<a id='line_8425'>great was their knowledge, that there was no discourse upon the face of</a>
<a id='line_8426'>the Island, however low it might be spoken, but what, if the wind met it,</a>
<a id='line_8427'>it was known to them.  And through this they could not be injured. {4}</a>
<a id='line_8428'></a>
<a id='line_8429'>The second plague was a shriek which came on every May-eve, over every</a>
<a id='line_8430'>hearth in the Island of Britain.  And this went through people’s hearts,</a>
<a id='line_8431'>and so scared them, that the men lost their hue and their strength, and</a>
<a id='line_8432'>the women their children, and the young men and the maidens lost their</a>
<a id='line_8433'>senses, and all the animals and trees and the earth and the waters, were</a>
<a id='line_8434'>left barren.</a>
<a id='line_8435'></a>
<a id='line_8436'>The third plague was, that however much of provisions and food might be</a>
<a id='line_8437'>prepared in the king’s courts, were there even so much as a year’s</a>
<a id='line_8438'>provision of meat and drink, none of it could ever be found, except what</a>
<a id='line_8439'>was consumed in the first night.  And two of these plagues, no one ever</a>
<a id='line_8440'>knew their cause, therefore was there better hope of being freed from the</a>
<a id='line_8441'>first than from the second and third.</a>
<a id='line_8442'></a>
<a id='line_8443'>And thereupon King Lludd felt great sorrow and care, because that he knew</a>
<a id='line_8444'>not how he might be freed from these plagues.  And he called to him all</a>
<a id='line_8445'>the nobles of his kingdom, and asked counsel of them what they should do</a>
<a id='line_8446'>against these afflictions.  And by the common counsel of the nobles,</a>
<a id='line_8447'>Lludd the son of Beli went to Llevelys his brother, king of France, for</a>
<a id='line_8448'>he was a man great of counsel and wisdom, to seek his advice.</a>
<a id='line_8449'></a>
<a id='line_8450'>And they made ready a fleet, and that in secret and in silence, lest that</a>
<a id='line_8451'>race should know the cause of their errand, or any besides the king and</a>
<a id='line_8452'>his counsellors.  And when they were made ready, they went into their</a>
<a id='line_8453'>ships, Lludd and those whom he chose with him.  And they began to cleave</a>
<a id='line_8454'>the seas towards France.</a>
<a id='line_8455'></a>
<a id='line_8456'>And when these tidings came to Llevelys, seeing that he knew not the</a>
<a id='line_8457'>cause of his brother’s ships, he came on the other side to meet him, and</a>
<a id='line_8458'>with him was a fleet vast of size.  And when Lludd saw this, he left all</a>
<a id='line_8459'>the ships out upon the sea except one only; and in that one he came to</a>
<a id='line_8460'>meet his brother, and he likewise with a single ship came to meet him.</a>
<a id='line_8461'>And when they were come together, each put his arms about the other’s</a>
<a id='line_8462'>neck, and they welcomed each other with brotherly love.</a>
<a id='line_8463'></a>
<a id='line_8464'>After that Lludd had shown his brother the cause of his errand, Llevelys</a>
<a id='line_8465'>said that he himself knew the cause of the coming to those lands.  And</a>
<a id='line_8466'>they took counsel together to discourse on the matter otherwise than</a>
<a id='line_8467'>thus, in order that the wind might not catch their words, nor the</a>
<a id='line_8468'>Coranians know what they might say.  Then Llevelys caused a long horn to</a>
<a id='line_8469'>be made of brass, and through this horn they discoursed.  But whatsoever</a>
<a id='line_8470'>words they spoke through this horn, one to the other, neither of them</a>
<a id='line_8471'>could hear any other but harsh and hostile words.  And when Llevelys saw</a>
<a id='line_8472'>this, and that there was a demon thwarting them and disturbing through</a>
<a id='line_8473'>this horn, he caused wine to be put therein to wash it.  And through the</a>
<a id='line_8474'>virtue of the wine the demon was driven out of the horn.  And when their</a>
<a id='line_8475'>discourse was unobstructed, Llevelys told his brother that he would give</a>
<a id='line_8476'>him some insects whereof he should keep some to breed, lest by chance the</a>
<a id='line_8477'>like affliction might come a second time.  And other of these insects he</a>
<a id='line_8478'>should take and bruise in water.  And he assured him that it would have</a>
<a id='line_8479'>power to destroy the race of the Coranians.  That is to say, that when he</a>
<a id='line_8480'>came home to his kingdom he should call together all the people both of</a>
<a id='line_8481'>his own race and of the race of the Coranians for a conference, as though</a>
<a id='line_8482'>with the intent of making peace between them; and that when they were all</a>
<a id='line_8483'>together, he should take this charmed water, and cast it over all alike.</a>
<a id='line_8484'>And he assured him that the water would poison the race of the Coranians,</a>
<a id='line_8485'>but that it would not slay or harm those of his own race.</a>
<a id='line_8486'></a>
<a id='line_8487'>“And the second plague,” said he, “that is in thy dominion, behold it is</a>
<a id='line_8488'>a dragon.  And another dragon of a foreign race is fighting with it, and</a>
<a id='line_8489'>striving to overcome it.  And therefore does your dragon make a fearful</a>
<a id='line_8490'>outcry.  And on this wise mayest thou come to know this.  After thou hast</a>
<a id='line_8491'>returned home, cause the Island to be measured in its length and breadth,</a>
<a id='line_8492'>and in the place where thou dost find the exact central point, there</a>
<a id='line_8493'>cause a pit to be dug, and cause a cauldron full of the best mead that</a>
<a id='line_8494'>can be made to be put in the pit, with a covering of satin over the face</a>
<a id='line_8495'>of the cauldron.  And then, in thine own person do thou remain there</a>
<a id='line_8496'>watching, and thou wilt see the dragon fighting in the form of terrific</a>
<a id='line_8497'>animals.  And at length they will take the form of dragons in the air.</a>
<a id='line_8498'>And last of all, after wearying themselves with fierce and furious</a>
<a id='line_8499'>fighting, they will fall in the form of two pigs upon the covering, and</a>
<a id='line_8500'>they will sink in, and the covering with them, and they will draw it down</a>
<a id='line_8501'>to the very bottom of the cauldron.  And they will drink up the whole of</a>
<a id='line_8502'>the mead; and after that they will sleep.  Thereupon do thou immediately</a>
<a id='line_8503'>fold the covering around them, and bury them in a kistvaen, in the</a>
<a id='line_8504'>strongest place thou hast in thy dominions, and hide them in the earth.</a>
<a id='line_8505'>And as long as they shall bide in that strong place no plague shall come</a>
<a id='line_8506'>to the Island of Britain from elsewhere.</a>
<a id='line_8507'></a>
<a id='line_8508'>“The cause of the third plague,” said he, “is a mighty man of magic, who</a>
<a id='line_8509'>take thy meat and thy drink and thy store.  And he through illusions and</a>
<a id='line_8510'>charms causes every one to sleep.  Therefore it is needful for thee in</a>
<a id='line_8511'>thy own person to watch thy food and thy provisions.  And lest he should</a>
<a id='line_8512'>overcome thee with sleep, be there a cauldron of cold water by thy side,</a>
<a id='line_8513'>and when thou art oppressed with sleep, plunge into the cauldron.”</a>
<a id='line_8514'></a>
<a id='line_8515'>Then Lludd returned back unto his land.  And immediately he summoned to</a>
<a id='line_8516'>him the whole of his own race and of the Coranians.  And as Llevelys had</a>
<a id='line_8517'>taught him, he bruised the insects in water, the which he cast over them</a>
<a id='line_8518'>all together, and forthwith it destroyed the whole tribe of the</a>
<a id='line_8519'>Coranians, without hurt to any of the Britons.</a>
<a id='line_8520'></a>
<a id='line_8521'>And some time after this, Lludd caused the Island to be measured in its</a>
<a id='line_8522'>length and in its breadth.  And in Oxford he found the central point, and</a>
<a id='line_8523'>in that place he caused the earth to be dug, and in that pit a cauldron</a>
<a id='line_8524'>to be set, full of the best mead that could be made, and a covering of</a>
<a id='line_8525'>satin over the face of it.  And he himself watched that night.  And while</a>
<a id='line_8526'>he was there, he beheld the dragons fighting.  And when they were weary</a>
<a id='line_8527'>they fell, and came down upon the top of the satin, and drew it with them</a>
<a id='line_8528'>to the bottom of the cauldron.  And when they had drunk the mead they</a>
<a id='line_8529'>slept.  And in their sleep, Lludd folded the covering around them, and in</a>
<a id='line_8530'>the securest place he had in Snowdon, he hid them in a kistvaen.  Now</a>
<a id='line_8531'>after that this spot was called Dinas Emreis, but before that, Dinas</a>
<a id='line_8532'>Ffaraon.  And thus the fierce outcry ceased in his dominions.</a>
<a id='line_8533'></a>
<a id='line_8534'>And when this was ended, King Lludd caused an exceeding great banquet to</a>
<a id='line_8535'>be prepared.  And when it was ready, he placed a vessel of cold water by</a>
<a id='line_8536'>his side, and he in his own proper person watched it.  And as he abode</a>
<a id='line_8537'>thus clad with arms, about the third watch of the night, lo, he heard</a>
<a id='line_8538'>many surpassing fascinations and various songs.  And drowsiness urged him</a>
<a id='line_8539'>to sleep.  Upon this, lest he should be hindered from his purpose and be</a>
<a id='line_8540'>overcome by sleep, he went often into the water.  And at last, behold, a</a>
<a id='line_8541'>man of vast size, clad in strong, heavy armour, came in, bearing a</a>
<a id='line_8542'>hamper.  And, as he was wont, he put all the food and provisions of meat</a>
<a id='line_8543'>and drink into the hamper, and proceeded to go with it forth.  And</a>
<a id='line_8544'>nothing was ever more wonderful to Lludd, than that the hamper should</a>
<a id='line_8545'>hold so much.</a>
<a id='line_8546'></a>
<a id='line_8547'>And thereupon King Lludd went after him and spoke unto him thus.  “Stop,</a>
<a id='line_8548'>stop,” said he, “though thou hast done many insults and much spoil</a>
<a id='line_8549'>erewhile, thou shalt not do so any more, unless thy skill in arms and thy</a>
<a id='line_8550'>prowess be greater than mine.”</a>
<a id='line_8551'></a>
<a id='line_8552'>Then he instantly put down the hamper on the floor, and awaited him.  And</a>
<a id='line_8553'>a fierce encounter was between them, so that the glittering fire flew out</a>
<a id='line_8554'>from their arms.  And at the last Lludd grappled with him, and fate</a>
<a id='line_8555'>bestowed the victory on Lludd.  And he threw the plague to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_8556'>And after he had overcome him by strength and might, he besought his</a>
<a id='line_8557'>mercy.  “How can I grant thee mercy,” said the king, “after all the many</a>
<a id='line_8558'>injuries and wrongs that thou hast done me?”  “All the losses that ever I</a>
<a id='line_8559'>have caused thee,” said he, “I will make thee atonement for, equal to</a>
<a id='line_8560'>what I have taken.  And I will never do the like from this time forth.</a>
<a id='line_8561'>But thy faithful vassal will I be.”  And the king accepted this from him.</a>
<a id='line_8562'></a>
<a id='line_8563'>And thus Lludd freed the Island of Britain from the three plagues.  And</a>
<a id='line_8564'>from thenceforth until the end of his life, in prosperous peace did Lludd</a>
<a id='line_8565'>the son of Beli rule the Island of Britain.  And this Tale is called the</a>
<a id='line_8566'>Story of Lludd and Llevelys.  And thus it ends.</a>
<a id='line_8567'></a>
<a id='line_8568'></a>
<a id='line_8569'></a>
<a id='line_8570'></a>
<a id='line_8571'>TALIESIN</a>
<a id='line_8572'></a>
<a id='line_8573'></a>
<a id='line_8574'>IN times past there lived in Penllyn a man of gentle lineage, named Tegid</a>
<a id='line_8575'>Voel, and his dwelling was in the midst of the lake Tegid, and his wife</a>
<a id='line_8576'>was called Caridwen.  And there was born to him of his wife a son named</a>
<a id='line_8577'>Morvran ab Tegid, and also a daughter named Creirwy, the fairest maiden</a>
<a id='line_8578'>in the world was she; and they had a brother, the most ill-favoured man</a>
<a id='line_8579'>in the world, Avagddu.  Now Caridwen his mother thought that he was not</a>
<a id='line_8580'>likely to be admitted among men of noble birth, by reason of his</a>
<a id='line_8581'>ugliness, unless he had some exalted merits or knowledge.  For it was in</a>
<a id='line_8582'>the beginning of Arthur’s time and of the Round Table.</a>
<a id='line_8583'></a>
<a id='line_8584'>So she resolved, according to the arts of the books of the Fferyllt, to</a>
<a id='line_8585'>boil a cauldron of Inspiration and Science for her son, that his</a>
<a id='line_8586'>reception might be honourable because of his knowledge of the mysteries</a>
<a id='line_8587'>of the future state of the world.</a>
<a id='line_8588'></a>
<a id='line_8589'>Then she began to boil the cauldron, which from the beginning of its</a>
<a id='line_8590'>boiling might not cease to boil for a year and a day, until three blessed</a>
<a id='line_8591'>drops were obtained of the grace of Inspiration.</a>
<a id='line_8592'></a>
<a id='line_8593'>And she put Gwion Bach the son of Gwreang of Llanfair in Caereinion, in</a>
<a id='line_8594'>Powys, to stir the cauldron, and a blind man named Morda to kindle the</a>
<a id='line_8595'>fire beneath it, and she charged them that they should not suffer it to</a>
<a id='line_8596'>cease boiling for the space of a year and a day.  And she herself,</a>
<a id='line_8597'>according to the books of the astronomers, and in planetary hours,</a>
<a id='line_8598'>gathered every day of all charm-bearing herbs.  And one day, towards the</a>
<a id='line_8599'>end of the year, as Caridwen was culling plants and making incantations,</a>
<a id='line_8600'>it chanced that three drops of the charmed liquor flew out of the</a>
<a id='line_8601'>cauldron and fell upon the finger of Gwion Bach.  And by reason of their</a>
<a id='line_8602'>great heat he put his finger to his mouth, and the instant he put those</a>
<a id='line_8603'>marvel-working drops into his mouth, he foresaw everything that was to</a>
<a id='line_8604'>come, and perceived that his chief care must be to guard against the</a>
<a id='line_8605'>wiles of Caridwen, for vast was her skill.  And in very great fear he</a>
<a id='line_8606'>fled towards his own land.  And the cauldron burst in two, because all</a>
<a id='line_8607'>the liquor within it except the three charm-bearing drops was poisonous,</a>
<a id='line_8608'>so that the horses of Gwyddno Garanhir were poisoned by the water of the</a>
<a id='line_8609'>stream into which the liquor of the cauldron ran, and the confluence of</a>
<a id='line_8610'>that stream was called the Poison of the Horses of Gwyddno from that time</a>
<a id='line_8611'>forth.</a>
<a id='line_8612'></a>
<a id='line_8613'>Thereupon came in Caridwen and saw all the toil of the whole year lost.</a>
<a id='line_8614'>And she seized a billet of wood and struck the blind Morda on the head</a>
<a id='line_8615'>until one of his eyes fell out upon his cheek.  And he said, “Wrongfully</a>
<a id='line_8616'>hast thou disfigured me, for I am innocent.  Thy loss was not because of</a>
<a id='line_8617'>me.”  “Thou speakest truth,” said Caridwen, “it was Gwion Bach who robbed</a>
<a id='line_8618'>me.”</a>
<a id='line_8619'></a>
<a id='line_8620'>And she went forth after him, running.  And he saw her, and changed</a>
<a id='line_8621'>himself into a hare and fled.  But she changed herself into a greyhound</a>
<a id='line_8622'>and turned him.  And he ran towards a river, and became a fish.  And she</a>
<a id='line_8623'>in the form of an otter-bitch chased him under the water, until he was</a>
<a id='line_8624'>fain to turn himself into a bird of the air.  She, as a hawk, followed</a>
<a id='line_8625'>him and gave him no rest in the sky.  And just as she was about to stoop</a>
<a id='line_8626'>upon him, and he was in fear of death, he espied a heap of winnowed wheat</a>
<a id='line_8627'>on the floor of a barn, and he dropped among the wheat, and turned</a>
<a id='line_8628'>himself into one of the grains.  Then she transformed herself into a</a>
<a id='line_8629'>high-crested black hen, and went to the wheat and scratched it with her</a>
<a id='line_8630'>feet, and found him out and swallowed him.  And, as the story says, she</a>
<a id='line_8631'>bore him nine months, and when she was delivered of him, she could not</a>
<a id='line_8632'>find it in her heart to kill him, by reason of his beauty.  So she</a>
<a id='line_8633'>wrapped him in a leathern bag, and cast him into the sea to the mercy of</a>
<a id='line_8634'>God, on the twenty-ninth day of April.</a>
<a id='line_8635'></a>
<a id='line_8636'>And at that time the weir of Gwyddno was on the strand between Dyvi and</a>
<a id='line_8637'>Aberystwyth, near to his own castle, and the value of an hundred pounds</a>
<a id='line_8638'>was taken in that weir every May eve.  And in those days Gwyddno had an</a>
<a id='line_8639'>only son named Elphin, the most hapless of youths, and the most needy.</a>
<a id='line_8640'>And it grieved his father sore, for he thought that he was born in an</a>
<a id='line_8641'>evil hour.  And by the advice of his council, his father had granted him</a>
<a id='line_8642'>the drawing of the weir that year, to see if good luck would ever befall</a>
<a id='line_8643'>him, and to give him something wherewith to begin the world.</a>
<a id='line_8644'></a>
<a id='line_8645'>And the next day when Elphin went to look, there was nothing in the weir.</a>
<a id='line_8646'>But as he turned back he perceived the leathern bag upon a pole of the</a>
<a id='line_8647'>weir.  Then said one of the weir-ward unto Elphin, “Thou wast never</a>
<a id='line_8648'>unlucky until to-night, and now thou hast destroyed the virtues of the</a>
<a id='line_8649'>weir, which always yielded the value of an hundred pounds every May eve,</a>
<a id='line_8650'>and to-night there is nothing but this leathern skin within it.”  “How</a>
<a id='line_8651'>now,” said Elphin, “there may be therein the value of an hundred pounds.”</a>
<a id='line_8652'>Well, they took up the leathern bag, and he who opened it saw the</a>
<a id='line_8653'>forehead of the boy, and said to Elphin, “Behold a radiant brow!” {6}</a>
<a id='line_8654'>“Taliesin be he called,” said Elphin.  And he lifted the boy in his arms,</a>
<a id='line_8655'>and lamenting his mischance, he placed him sorrowfully behind him.  And</a>
<a id='line_8656'>he made his horse amble gently, that before had been trotting, and he</a>
<a id='line_8657'>carried him as softly as if he had been sitting in the easiest chair in</a>
<a id='line_8658'>the world.  And presently the boy made a Consolation and praise to</a>
<a id='line_8659'>Elphin, and foretold honour to Elphin; and the Consolation was as you may</a>
<a id='line_8660'>see:—</a>
<a id='line_8661'></a>
<a id='line_8662'>   “Fair Elphin, cease to lament!</a>
<a id='line_8663'>   Let no one be dissatisfied with his own,</a>
<a id='line_8664'>   To despair will bring no advantage.</a>
<a id='line_8665'>   No man sees what supports him;</a>
<a id='line_8666'>   The prayer of Cynllo will not be in vain;</a>
<a id='line_8667'>   God will not violate his promise.</a>
<a id='line_8668'>   Never in Gwyddno’s weir</a>
<a id='line_8669'>   Was there such good luck as this night.</a>
<a id='line_8670'>   Fair Elphin, dry thy cheeks!</a>
<a id='line_8671'>   Being too sad will not avail.</a>
<a id='line_8672'>   Although thou thinkest thou hast no gain,</a>
<a id='line_8673'>   Too much grief will bring thee no good;</a>
<a id='line_8674'>   Nor doubt the miracles of the Almighty:</a>
<a id='line_8675'>   Although I am but little, I am highly gifted.</a>
<a id='line_8676'>   From seas, and from mountains,</a>
<a id='line_8677'>   And from the depths of rivers,</a>
<a id='line_8678'>   God brings wealth to the fortunate man.</a>
<a id='line_8679'>   Elphin of lively qualities,</a>
<a id='line_8680'>   Thy resolution is unmanly;</a>
<a id='line_8681'>   Thou must not be over sorrowful:</a>
<a id='line_8682'>   Better to trust in God than to forbode ill.</a>
<a id='line_8683'>   Weak and small as I am,</a>
<a id='line_8684'>   On the foaming beach of the ocean,</a>
<a id='line_8685'>   In the day of trouble I shall be</a>
<a id='line_8686'>   Of more service to thee than three hundred salmon.</a>
<a id='line_8687'>   Elphin of notable qualities,</a>
<a id='line_8688'>   Be not displeased at thy misfortune;</a>
<a id='line_8689'>   Although reclined thus weak in my bag,</a>
<a id='line_8690'>   There lies a virtue in my tongue.</a>
<a id='line_8691'>   While I continue thy protector</a>
<a id='line_8692'>   Thou hast not much to fear;</a>
<a id='line_8693'>   Remembering the names of the Trinity,</a>
<a id='line_8694'>   None shall be able to harm thee.”</a>
<a id='line_8695'></a>
<a id='line_8696'>And this was the first poem that Taliesin ever sang, being to console</a>
<a id='line_8697'>Elphin in his grief for that the produce of the weir was lost, and, what</a>
<a id='line_8698'>was worse, that all the world would consider that it was through his</a>
<a id='line_8699'>fault and ill-luck.  And then Gwyddno Garanhir {7} asked him what he was,</a>
<a id='line_8700'>whether man or spirit.  Whereupon he sang this tale, and said:—</a>
<a id='line_8701'></a>
<a id='line_8702'>   “First, I have been formed a comely person,</a>
<a id='line_8703'>   In the court of Caridwen I have done penance;</a>
<a id='line_8704'>   Though little I was seen, placidly received,</a>
<a id='line_8705'>   I was great on the floor of the place to where I was led;</a>
<a id='line_8706'>   I have been a prized defence, the sweet muse the cause,</a>
<a id='line_8707'>   And by law without speech I have been liberated</a>
<a id='line_8708'>   By a smiling black old hag, when irritated</a>
<a id='line_8709'>   Dreadful her claim when pursued:</a>
<a id='line_8710'>   I have fled with vigour, I have fled as a frog,</a>
<a id='line_8711'>   I have fled in the semblance of a crow, scarcely finding rest;</a>
<a id='line_8712'>   I have fled vehemently, I have fled as a chain,</a>
<a id='line_8713'>   I have fled as a roe into an entangled thicket;</a>
<a id='line_8714'>   I have fled as a wolf cub, I have fled as a wolf in a wilderness,</a>
<a id='line_8715'>   I have fled as a thrush of portending language;</a>
<a id='line_8716'>   I have fled as a fox, used to concurrent bounds of quirks;</a>
<a id='line_8717'>   I have fled as a martin, which did not avail;</a>
<a id='line_8718'>   I have fled as a squirrel, that vainly hides,</a>
<a id='line_8719'>   I have fled as a stag’s antler, of ruddy course,</a>
<a id='line_8720'>   I have fled as iron in a glowing fire,</a>
<a id='line_8721'>   I have fled as a spear-head, of woe to such as has a wish for it;</a>
<a id='line_8722'>   I have fled as a fierce hull bitterly fighting,</a>
<a id='line_8723'>   I have fled as a bristly boar seen in a ravine,</a>
<a id='line_8724'>   I have fled as a white grain of pure wheat,</a>
<a id='line_8725'>   On the skirt of a hempen sheet entangled,</a>
<a id='line_8726'>   That seemed of the size of a mare’s foal,</a>
<a id='line_8727'>   That is filling like a ship on the waters;</a>
<a id='line_8728'>   Into a dark leathern bag I was thrown,</a>
<a id='line_8729'>   And on a boundless sea I was sent adrift;</a>
<a id='line_8730'>   Which was to me an omen of being tenderly nursed,</a>
<a id='line_8731'>   And the Lord God then set me at liberty.”</a>
<a id='line_8732'></a>
<a id='line_8733'>Then came Elphin to the house or court of Gwyddno his father, and</a>
<a id='line_8734'>Taliesin with him.  And Gwyddno asked him if he had had a good haul at</a>
<a id='line_8735'>the weir, and he told him that he had got that which was better than</a>
<a id='line_8736'>fish.  “What was that?” said Gwyddno.  “A Bard,” answered Elphin.  Then</a>
<a id='line_8737'>said Gwyddno, “Alas, what will he profit thee?”  And Taliesin himself</a>
<a id='line_8738'>replied and said, “He will profit him more than the weir ever profited</a>
<a id='line_8739'>thee.”  Asked Gwyddno, “Art thou able to speak, and thou so little?”  And</a>
<a id='line_8740'>Taliesin answered him, “I am better able to speak than thou to question</a>
<a id='line_8741'>me.”  “Let me hear what thou canst say,” quoth Gwyddno.  Then Taliesin</a>
<a id='line_8742'>sang:—</a>
<a id='line_8743'></a>
<a id='line_8744'>   “In water there is a quality endowed with a blessing;</a>
<a id='line_8745'>   On God it is most just to meditate aright;</a>
<a id='line_8746'>   To God it is proper to supplicate with seriousness,</a>
<a id='line_8747'>   Since no obstacle can there be to obtain a reward from him.</a>
<a id='line_8748'>   Three times have I been born, I know by meditation;</a>
<a id='line_8749'>   It were miserable for a person not to come and obtain</a>
<a id='line_8750'>   All the sciences of the world, collected together in my breast,</a>
<a id='line_8751'>   For I know what has been, what in future will occur.</a>
<a id='line_8752'>   I will supplicate my Lord that I get refuge in him,</a>
<a id='line_8753'>   A regard I may obtain in his grace;</a>
<a id='line_8754'>   The Son of Mary is my trust, great in him is my delight,</a>
<a id='line_8755'>   For in him is the world continually upholden.</a>
<a id='line_8756'>   God has been to instruct me and to raise my expectation,</a>
<a id='line_8757'>   The true Creator of heaven, who affords me protection;</a>
<a id='line_8758'>   It is rightly intended that the saints should daily pray,</a>
<a id='line_8759'>   For God, the renovator, will bring them to him.”</a>
<a id='line_8760'></a>
<a id='line_8761'>And forthwith Elphin gave his haul to his wife, and she nursed him</a>
<a id='line_8762'>tenderly and lovingly.  Thenceforward Elphin increased in riches more and</a>
<a id='line_8763'>more day after day, and in love and favour with the king, and there abode</a>
<a id='line_8764'>Taliesin until he was thirteen years old, when Elphin son of Gwyddno went</a>
<a id='line_8765'>by a Christmas invitation to his uncle, Maelgwn Gwynedd, who some time</a>
<a id='line_8766'>after this held open court at Christmastide in the castle of Dyganwy, for</a>
<a id='line_8767'>all the number of his lords of both degrees, both spiritual and temporal,</a>
<a id='line_8768'>with a vast and thronged host of knights and squires.  And amongst them</a>
<a id='line_8769'>there arose a discourse and discussion.  And thus was it said.</a>
<a id='line_8770'></a>
<a id='line_8771'>“Is there in the whole world a king so great as Maelgwn, or one on whom</a>
<a id='line_8772'>Heaven has bestowed so many spiritual gifts as upon him?  First, form,</a>
<a id='line_8773'>and beauty, and meekness, and strength, besides all the powers of the</a>
<a id='line_8774'>soul!”  And together with these they said that Heaven had given one gift</a>
<a id='line_8775'>that exceeded all the others, which was the beauty, and comeliness, and</a>
<a id='line_8776'>grace, and wisdom, and modesty of his queen; whose virtues surpassed</a>
<a id='line_8777'>those of all the ladies and noble maidens throughout the whole kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_8778'>And with this they put questions one to another amongst themselves: Who</a>
<a id='line_8779'>had braver men?  Who had fairer or swifter horses or greyhounds?  Who had</a>
<a id='line_8780'>more skilful or wiser bards—than Maelgwn?</a>
<a id='line_8781'></a>
<a id='line_8782'>Now at that time the bards were in great favour with the exalted of the</a>
<a id='line_8783'>kingdom; and then none performed the office of those who are now called</a>
<a id='line_8784'>heralds, unless they were learned men, not only expert in the service of</a>
<a id='line_8785'>kings and princes, but studious and well versed in the lineage, and arms,</a>
<a id='line_8786'>and exploits of princes and kings, and in discussions concerning foreign</a>
<a id='line_8787'>kingdoms, and the ancient things of this kingdom, and chiefly in the</a>
<a id='line_8788'>annals of the first nobles; and also were prepared always with their</a>
<a id='line_8789'>answers in various languages, Latin, French, Welsh, and English.  And</a>
<a id='line_8790'>together with this they were great chroniclers, and recorders, and</a>
<a id='line_8791'>skilful in framing verses, and ready in making englyns in every one of</a>
<a id='line_8792'>those languages.  Now of these there were at that feast within the palace</a>
<a id='line_8793'>of Maelgwn as many as four-and-twenty, and chief of them all was one</a>
<a id='line_8794'>named Heinin Vardd.</a>
<a id='line_8795'></a>
<a id='line_8796'>When they had all made an end of thus praising the king and his gifts, it</a>
<a id='line_8797'>befell that Elphin spoke in this wise.  “Of a truth none but a king may</a>
<a id='line_8798'>vie with a king; but were he not a king, I would say that my wife was as</a>
<a id='line_8799'>virtuous as any lady in the kingdom, and also that I have a bard who is</a>
<a id='line_8800'>more skilful than all the king’s bards.”  In a short space some of his</a>
<a id='line_8801'>fellows showed the king all the boastings of Elphin; and the king ordered</a>
<a id='line_8802'>him to be thrown into a strong prison, until he might know the truth as</a>
<a id='line_8803'>to the virtues of his wife, and the wisdom of his bard.</a>
<a id='line_8804'></a>
<a id='line_8805'>Now when Elphin had been put in a tower of the castle, with a thick chain</a>
<a id='line_8806'>about his feet (it is said that it was a silver chain, because he was of</a>
<a id='line_8807'>royal blood), the king, as the story relates, sent his son Rhun to</a>
<a id='line_8808'>inquire into the demeanour of Elphin’s wife.  Now Rhun was the most</a>
<a id='line_8809'>graceless man in the world, and there was neither wife nor maiden with</a>
<a id='line_8810'>whom he had held converse, but was evil spoken of.  While Rhun went in</a>
<a id='line_8811'>haste towards Elphin’s dwelling, being fully minded to bring disgrace</a>
<a id='line_8812'>upon his wife, Taliesin told his mistress how that the king had placed</a>
<a id='line_8813'>his master in durance in prison, and how that Rhun was coming in haste to</a>
<a id='line_8814'>strive to bring disgrace upon her.  Wherefore he caused his mistress to</a>
<a id='line_8815'>array one of the maids of her kitchen in her apparel; which the noble</a>
<a id='line_8816'>lady gladly did; and she loaded her hands with the best rings that she</a>
<a id='line_8817'>and her husband possessed.</a>
<a id='line_8818'></a>
<a id='line_8819'>In this guise Taliesin caused his mistress to put the maiden to sit at</a>
<a id='line_8820'>the board in her room at supper, and he made her to seem as her mistress,</a>
<a id='line_8821'>and the mistress to seem as the maid.  And when they were in due time</a>
<a id='line_8822'>seated at their supper in the manner that has been said, Rhun suddenly</a>
<a id='line_8823'>arrived at Elphin’s dwelling, and was received with joy, for all the</a>
<a id='line_8824'>servants knew him plainly; and they brought him in haste to the room of</a>
<a id='line_8825'>their mistress, in the semblance of whom the maid rose up from supper and</a>
<a id='line_8826'>welcomed him gladly.  And afterwards she sat down to supper again the</a>
<a id='line_8827'>second time, and Rhun with her.  Then Rhun began jesting with the maid,</a>
<a id='line_8828'>who still kept the semblance of her mistress.  And verily this story</a>
<a id='line_8829'>shows that the maiden became so intoxicated, that she fell asleep; and</a>
<a id='line_8830'>the story relates that it was a powder that Rhun put into the drink, that</a>
<a id='line_8831'>made her sleep so soundly that she never felt it when he cut from off her</a>
<a id='line_8832'>hand her little finger, whereupon was the signet ring of Elphin, which he</a>
<a id='line_8833'>had sent to his wife as a token, a short time before.  And Rhun returned</a>
<a id='line_8834'>to the king with the finger and the ring as a proof, to show that he had</a>
<a id='line_8835'>cut it from off her hand, without her awaking from her sleep of</a>
<a id='line_8836'>intemperance.</a>
<a id='line_8837'></a>
<a id='line_8838'>The king rejoiced greatly at these tidings, and he sent for his</a>
<a id='line_8839'>councillors, to whom he told the whole story from the beginning.  And he</a>
<a id='line_8840'>caused Elphin to be brought out of his prison, and he chided him because</a>
<a id='line_8841'>of his boast.  And he spake unto Elphin on this wise.  “Elphin, be it</a>
<a id='line_8842'>known to thee beyond a doubt that it is but folly for a man to trust in</a>
<a id='line_8843'>the virtues of his wife further than he can see her; and that thou mayest</a>
<a id='line_8844'>be certain of thy wife’s vileness, behold her finger, with thy signet</a>
<a id='line_8845'>ring upon it, which was cut from her hand last night, while she slept the</a>
<a id='line_8846'>sleep of intoxication.”  Then thus spake Elphin.  “With thy leave, mighty</a>
<a id='line_8847'>king, I cannot deny my ring, for it is known of many; but verily I assert</a>
<a id='line_8848'>strongly that the finger around which it is, was never attached to the</a>
<a id='line_8849'>hand of my wife, for in truth and certainty there are three notable</a>
<a id='line_8850'>things pertaining to it, none of which ever belonged to any of my wife’s</a>
<a id='line_8851'>fingers.  The first of the three is, that it is certain, by your grace’s</a>
<a id='line_8852'>leave, that wheresoever my wife is at this present hour, whether sitting,</a>
<a id='line_8853'>or standing, or lying down, this ring would never remain upon her thumb,</a>
<a id='line_8854'>whereas you can plainly see that it was hard to draw it over the joint of</a>
<a id='line_8855'>the little finger of the hand whence this was cut; the second thing is,</a>
<a id='line_8856'>that my wife has never let pass one Saturday since I have known her</a>
<a id='line_8857'>without paring her nails before going to bed, and you can see fully that</a>
<a id='line_8858'>the nail of this little finger has not been pared for a month.  The third</a>
<a id='line_8859'>is, truly, that the hand whence this finger came was kneading rye dough</a>
<a id='line_8860'>within three days before the finger was cut therefrom, and I can assure</a>
<a id='line_8861'>your goodness that my wife has never kneaded rye dough since my wife she</a>
<a id='line_8862'>has been.”</a>
<a id='line_8863'></a>
<a id='line_8864'>Then the king was mightily wroth with Elphin for so stoutly withstanding</a>
<a id='line_8865'>him, respecting the goodness of his wife, wherefore he ordered him to his</a>
<a id='line_8866'>prison a second time, saying that he should not be loosed thence until he</a>
<a id='line_8867'>had proved the truth of his boast, as well concerning the wisdom of his</a>
<a id='line_8868'>bard as the virtues of his wife.</a>
<a id='line_8869'></a>
<a id='line_8870'>In the meantime his wife and Taliesin remained joyful at Elphin’s</a>
<a id='line_8871'>dwelling.  And Taliesin showed his mistress how that Elphin was in prison</a>
<a id='line_8872'>because of them, but he bade her be glad, for that he would go to</a>
<a id='line_8873'>Maelgwn’s court to free his master.  Then she asked him in what manner he</a>
<a id='line_8874'>would set him free.  And he answered her:—</a>
<a id='line_8875'></a>
<a id='line_8876'>   “A journey will I perform,</a>
<a id='line_8877'>   And to the gate I will come;</a>
<a id='line_8878'>   The hall I will enter,</a>
<a id='line_8879'>   And my song I will sing;</a>
<a id='line_8880'>   My speech I will pronounce</a>
<a id='line_8881'>   To silence royal bards,</a>
<a id='line_8882'>   In presence of their chief,</a>
<a id='line_8883'>   I will greet to deride,</a>
<a id='line_8884'>   Upon them I will break</a>
<a id='line_8885'>   And Elphin I will free.</a>
<a id='line_8886'>   Should contention arise,</a>
<a id='line_8887'>   In presence of the prince,</a>
<a id='line_8888'>   With summons to the bards,</a>
<a id='line_8889'>   For the sweet flowing song,</a>
<a id='line_8890'>   And wizards’ posing lore</a>
<a id='line_8891'>   And wisdom of Druids,</a>
<a id='line_8892'>   In the court of the sons of the Distributor</a>
<a id='line_8893'>   Some are who did appear</a>
<a id='line_8894'>   Intent on wily schemes,</a>

<a id='line_8899'>   As erst in Badon’s fight,—</a>

<a id='line_8902'>   Through feats of testy men,</a>
<a id='line_8903'>   And a chief with his foes.</a>
<a id='line_8904'>   Woe be to them, the fools,</a>
<a id='line_8905'>   When revenge comes on them.</a>
<a id='line_8906'>   I Taliesin, chief of bards,</a>
<a id='line_8907'>   With a sapient Druid’s words,</a>
<a id='line_8908'>   Will set kind Elphin free</a>
<a id='line_8909'>   From haughty tyrant’s bonds.</a>
<a id='line_8910'>   To their fell and chilling cry,</a>
<a id='line_8911'>   By the act of a surprising steed,</a>
<a id='line_8912'>   From the far distant North,</a>
<a id='line_8913'>   There soon shall be an end.</a>
<a id='line_8914'>   Let neither grace nor health</a>
<a id='line_8915'>   Be to Maelgwn Gwynedd,</a>
<a id='line_8916'>   For this force and this wrong;</a>
<a id='line_8917'>   And be extremes of ills</a>
<a id='line_8918'>   And an avenged end</a>
<a id='line_8919'>   To Rhun and all his race:</a>
<a id='line_8920'>   Short be his course of life,</a>
<a id='line_8921'>   Be all his lands laid waste;</a>
<a id='line_8922'>   And long exile be assigned</a>
<a id='line_8923'>   To Maelgwn Gwynedd!”</a>
<a id='line_8924'></a>
<a id='line_8925'>After this he took leave of his mistress, and came at last to the Court</a>
<a id='line_8926'>of Maelgwn, who was going to sit in his hall and dine in his royal state,</a>
<a id='line_8927'>as it was the custom in those days for kings and princes to do at every</a>
<a id='line_8928'>chief feast.  And as soon as Taliesin entered the hall, he placed himself</a>
<a id='line_8929'>in a quiet corner, near the place where the bards and the minstrels were</a>
<a id='line_8930'>wont to come in doing their service and duty to the king, as is the</a>
<a id='line_8931'>custom at the high festivals when the bounty is proclaimed.  And so, when</a>
<a id='line_8932'>the bards and the heralds came to cry largess, and to proclaim the power</a>
<a id='line_8933'>of the king and his strength, at the moment that they passed by the</a>
<a id='line_8934'>corner wherein he was crouching, Taliesin pouted out his lips after them,</a>
<a id='line_8935'>and played “Blerwm, blerwm,” with his finger upon his lips.  Neither took</a>
<a id='line_8936'>they much notice of him as they went by, but proceeded forward till they</a>
<a id='line_8937'>came before the king, unto whom they made their obeisance with their</a>
<a id='line_8938'>bodies, as they were wont, without speaking a single word, but pouting</a>
<a id='line_8939'>out their lips, and making mouths at the king, playing “Blerwm, blerwm,”</a>
<a id='line_8940'>upon their lips with their fingers, as they had seen the boy do</a>
<a id='line_8941'>elsewhere.  This sight caused the king to wonder and to deem within</a>
<a id='line_8942'>himself that they were drunk with many liquors.  Wherefore he commanded</a>
<a id='line_8943'>one of his lords, who served at the board, to go to them and desire them</a>
<a id='line_8944'>to collect their wits, and to consider where they stood, and what it was</a>
<a id='line_8945'>fitting for them to do.  And this lord did so gladly.  But they ceased</a>
<a id='line_8946'>not from their folly any more than before.  Whereupon he sent to them a</a>
<a id='line_8947'>second time, and a third, desiring them to go forth from the hall.  At</a>
<a id='line_8948'>the last the king ordered one of his squires to give a blow to the chief</a>
<a id='line_8949'>of them named Heinin Vardd; and the squire took a broom and struck him on</a>
<a id='line_8950'>the head, so that he fell back in his seat.  Then he arose and went on</a>
<a id='line_8951'>his knees, and besought leave of the king’s grace to show that this their</a>
<a id='line_8952'>fault was not through want of knowledge, neither through drunkenness, but</a>
<a id='line_8953'>by the influence of some spirit that was in the hall.  And after this</a>
<a id='line_8954'>Heinin spoke on this wise.  “Oh, honourable king, be it known to your</a>
<a id='line_8955'>grace, that not from the strength of drink, or of too much liquor, are we</a>
<a id='line_8956'>dumb, without power of speech like drunken men, but through the influence</a>
<a id='line_8957'>of a spirit that sits in the corner yonder in the form of a child.”</a>
<a id='line_8958'>Forthwith the king commanded the squire to fetch him; and he went to the</a>
<a id='line_8959'>nook where Taliesin sat, and brought him before the king, who asked him</a>
<a id='line_8960'>what he was, and whence he came.  And he answered the king in verse.</a>
<a id='line_8961'></a>
<a id='line_8962'>   “Primary chief bard am I to Elphin,</a>
<a id='line_8963'>   And my original country is the region of the summer stars;</a>

<a id='line_8986'></a>
<a id='line_8987'>   I have been with my Lord in the manger of the ass:</a>

<a id='line_8989'>   I have been in the firmament with Mary Magdalene;</a>
<a id='line_8990'>   I have obtained the muse from the cauldron of Caridwen;</a>

<a id='line_9005'></a>
<a id='line_9006'>And when the king and his nobles had heard the song, they wondered much,</a>
<a id='line_9007'>for they had never heard the like from a boy so young as he.  And when</a>
<a id='line_9008'>the king knew that he was the bard of Elphin, he bade Heinin, his first</a>
<a id='line_9009'>and wisest bard, to answer Taliesin and to strive with him.  But when he</a>
<a id='line_9010'>came, he could do no other but play “blerwm” on his lips; and when he</a>
<a id='line_9011'>sent for the others of the four-and-twenty bards they all did likewise,</a>
<a id='line_9012'>and could do no other.  And Maelgwn asked the boy Taliesin what was his</a>
<a id='line_9013'>errand, and he answered him in song.</a>
<a id='line_9014'></a>
<a id='line_9015'>   “Puny bards, I am trying</a>

<a id='line_9181'></a>
<a id='line_9182'>And while he was thus singing his verse near the door, there arose a</a>
<a id='line_9183'>mighty storm of wind, so that the king and all his nobles thought that</a>
<a id='line_9184'>the castle would fall on their heads.  And the king caused them to fetch</a>
<a id='line_9185'>Elphin in haste from his dungeon, and placed him before Taliesin.  And it</a>
<a id='line_9186'>is said, that immediately he sang a verse, so that the chains opened from</a>
<a id='line_9187'>about his feet.</a>
<a id='line_9188'></a>
<a id='line_9189'>   “I adore the Supreme, Lord of all animation,—</a>

<a id='line_9200'>   Some are wild, some are tame; the Lord makes them;—</a>
<a id='line_9201'>   Part of their produce becomes clothing;</a>
<a id='line_9202'>   For food and beverage till doom will they continue.</a>
<a id='line_9203'>   I entreat the Supreme, Sovereign of the region of peace,</a>
<a id='line_9204'>   To liberate Elphin from banishment,</a>

<a id='line_9210'>   Elphin, knight of mead, late be thy dissolution!”</a>
<a id='line_9211'></a>
<a id='line_9212'>And afterwards he sang the ode which is called “The Excellence of the</a>
<a id='line_9213'>Bards.”</a>
<a id='line_9214'></a>
<a id='line_9215'>   “What was the first man</a>

<a id='line_9238'>   Let them reply to me, Taliesin.”</a>
<a id='line_9239'></a>
<a id='line_9240'>And after that he sang the address which is called “The Reproof of the</a>
<a id='line_9241'>Bards.”</a>

<a id='line_9243'>   “If thou art a bard completely imbued</a>

<a id='line_9273'></a>
<a id='line_9274'>Then sang he the piece called “The Spite of the Bards.”</a>
<a id='line_9275'></a>
<a id='line_9276'>   “Minstrels persevere in their false custom,</a>

<a id='line_9290'>   Every senseless word they bring forward;</a>

<a id='line_9297'>   Psalms or prayers they do not use,</a>
<a id='line_9298'>   Tithes or offerings to God they do not pay,</a>
<a id='line_9299'>   On holidays or Sundays they do not worship;</a>
<a id='line_9300'>   Vigils or festivals they do not heed.</a>
<a id='line_9301'>   The birds do fly, the fish do swim,</a>
<a id='line_9302'>   The bees collect honey, worms do crawl,</a>

<a id='line_9305'></a>
<a id='line_9306'>   I deride neither song nor minstrelsy,</a>

<a id='line_9309'>   For blaspheming Jesus and his service.”</a>
<a id='line_9310'></a>
<a id='line_9311'>Taliesin having set his master free from prison, and having protected the</a>
<a id='line_9312'>innocence of his wife, and silenced the Bards, so that not one of them</a>
<a id='line_9313'>dared to say a word, now brought Elphin’s wife before them, and showed</a>
<a id='line_9314'>that she had not one finger wanting.  Right glad was Elphin, right glad</a>
<a id='line_9315'>was Taliesin.</a>
<a id='line_9316'></a>
<a id='line_9317'>Then he bade Elphin wager the king, that he had a horse both better and</a>
<a id='line_9318'>swifter than the king’s horses.  And this Elphin did, and the day, and</a>
<a id='line_9319'>the time, and the place were fixed, and the place was that which at this</a>
<a id='line_9320'>day is called Morva Rhiannedd: and thither the king went with all his</a>
<a id='line_9321'>people, and four-and-twenty of the swiftest horses he possessed.  And</a>
<a id='line_9322'>after a long process the course was marked, and the horses were placed</a>
<a id='line_9323'>for running.  Then came Taliesin with four-and-twenty twigs of holly,</a>
<a id='line_9324'>which he had burnt black, and he caused the youth who was to ride his</a>
<a id='line_9325'>master’s horse to place them in his belt, and he gave him orders to let</a>
<a id='line_9326'>all the king’s horses get before him, and as he should overtake one horse</a>
<a id='line_9327'>after the other, to take one of the twigs and strike the horse with it</a>
<a id='line_9328'>over the crupper, and then let that twig fall; and after that to take</a>
<a id='line_9329'>another twig, and do in like manner to every one of the horses, as he</a>
<a id='line_9330'>should overtake them, enjoining the horseman strictly to watch when his</a>
<a id='line_9331'>own horse should stumble, and to throw down his cap on the spot.  All</a>
<a id='line_9332'>these things did the youth fulfil, giving a blow to every one of the</a>
<a id='line_9333'>king’s horses, and throwing down his cap on the spot where his horse</a>
<a id='line_9334'>stumbled.  And to this spot Taliesin brought his master after his horse</a>
<a id='line_9335'>had won the race.  And he caused Elphin to put workmen to dig a hole</a>
<a id='line_9336'>there; and when they had dug the ground deep enough, they found a large</a>
<a id='line_9337'>cauldron full of gold.  And then said Taliesin, “Elphin, behold a payment</a>
<a id='line_9338'>and reward unto thee, for having taken me out of the weir, and for having</a>
<a id='line_9339'>reared me from that time until now.”  And on this spot stands a pool of</a>
<a id='line_9340'>water, which is to this time called Pwllbair.</a>
<a id='line_9341'></a>
<a id='line_9342'>After all this, the king caused Taliesin to be brought before him, and he</a>
<a id='line_9343'>asked him to recite concerning the creation of man from the beginning;</a>
<a id='line_9344'>and thereupon he made the poem which is now called “One of the Four</a>
<a id='line_9345'>Pillars of Song.”</a>
<a id='line_9346'></a>
<a id='line_9347'>   “The Almighty made,</a>
