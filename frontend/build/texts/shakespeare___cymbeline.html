<a id='line_87'></a>
<a id='line_88'>SCENE I. Britain. The garden of Cymbeline’s palace.</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'> Enter two Gentlemen.</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>FIRST GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_93'>You do not meet a man but frowns; our bloods</a>
<a id='line_94'>No more obey the heavens than our courtiers</a>
<a id='line_95'>Still seem as does the King’s.</a>
<a id='line_96'></a>
<a id='line_97'>SECOND GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_98'>But what’s the matter?</a>
<a id='line_99'></a>
<a id='line_100'>FIRST GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_101'>His daughter, and the heir of’s kingdom, whom</a>
<a id='line_102'>He purpos’d to his wife’s sole son—a widow</a>
<a id='line_103'>That late he married—hath referr’d herself</a>
<a id='line_104'>Unto a poor but worthy gentleman. She’s wedded;</a>
<a id='line_105'>Her husband banish’d; she imprison’d. All</a>
<a id='line_106'>Is outward sorrow, though I think the King</a>
<a id='line_107'>Be touch’d at very heart.</a>
<a id='line_108'></a>
<a id='line_109'>SECOND GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_110'>None but the King?</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'>FIRST GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_113'>He that hath lost her too. So is the Queen,</a>
<a id='line_114'>That most desir’d the match. But not a courtier,</a>
<a id='line_115'>Although they wear their faces to the bent</a>
<a id='line_116'>Of the King’s looks, hath a heart that is not</a>
<a id='line_117'>Glad at the thing they scowl at.</a>
<a id='line_118'></a>
<a id='line_119'>SECOND GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_120'>And why so?</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>FIRST GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_123'>He that hath miss’d the Princess is a thing</a>
<a id='line_124'>Too bad for bad report; and he that hath her—</a>
<a id='line_125'>I mean that married her, alack, good man!</a>
<a id='line_126'>And therefore banish’d—is a creature such</a>
<a id='line_127'>As, to seek through the regions of the earth</a>
<a id='line_128'>For one his like, there would be something failing</a>
<a id='line_129'>In him that should compare. I do not think</a>
<a id='line_130'>So fair an outward and such stuff within</a>
<a id='line_131'>Endows a man but he.</a>
<a id='line_132'></a>
<a id='line_133'>SECOND GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_134'>You speak him far.</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>FIRST GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_137'>I do extend him, sir, within himself;</a>
<a id='line_138'>Crush him together rather than unfold</a>
<a id='line_139'>His measure duly.</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>SECOND GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_142'>What’s his name and birth?</a>
<a id='line_143'></a>
<a id='line_144'>FIRST GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_145'>I cannot delve him to the root; his father</a>
<a id='line_146'>Was call’d Sicilius, who did join his honour</a>
<a id='line_147'>Against the Romans with Cassibelan,</a>
<a id='line_148'>But had his titles by Tenantius, whom</a>
<a id='line_149'>He serv’d with glory and admir’d success,</a>
<a id='line_150'>So gain’d the sur-addition Leonatus;</a>
<a id='line_151'>And had, besides this gentleman in question,</a>
<a id='line_152'>Two other sons, who, in the wars o’ th’ time,</a>
<a id='line_153'>Died with their swords in hand; for which their father,</a>
<a id='line_154'>Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow</a>
<a id='line_155'>That he quit being; and his gentle lady,</a>
<a id='line_156'>Big of this gentleman, our theme, deceas’d</a>
<a id='line_157'>As he was born. The King he takes the babe</a>
<a id='line_158'>To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,</a>
<a id='line_159'>Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,</a>
<a id='line_160'>Puts to him all the learnings that his time</a>
<a id='line_161'>Could make him the receiver of; which he took,</a>
<a id='line_162'>As we do air, fast as ’twas minist’red,</a>
<a id='line_163'>And in’s spring became a harvest, liv’d in court—</a>
<a id='line_164'>Which rare it is to do—most prais’d, most lov’d,</a>
<a id='line_165'>A sample to the youngest; to th’ more mature</a>
<a id='line_166'>A glass that feated them; and to the graver</a>
<a id='line_167'>A child that guided dotards. To his mistress,</a>
<a id='line_168'>For whom he now is banish’d, her own price</a>
<a id='line_169'>Proclaims how she esteem’d him and his virtue;</a>
<a id='line_170'>By her election may be truly read</a>
<a id='line_171'>What kind of man he is.</a>
<a id='line_172'></a>
<a id='line_173'>SECOND GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_174'>I honour him</a>
<a id='line_175'>Even out of your report. But pray you tell me,</a>
<a id='line_176'>Is she sole child to th’ King?</a>
<a id='line_177'></a>
<a id='line_178'>FIRST GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_179'>His only child.</a>
<a id='line_180'>He had two sons—if this be worth your hearing,</a>
<a id='line_181'>Mark it—the eldest of them at three years old,</a>
<a id='line_182'>I’ th’ swathing clothes the other, from their nursery</a>
<a id='line_183'>Were stol’n; and to this hour no guess in knowledge</a>
<a id='line_184'>Which way they went.</a>
<a id='line_185'></a>
<a id='line_186'>SECOND GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_187'>How long is this ago?</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>FIRST GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_190'>Some twenty years.</a>
<a id='line_191'></a>
<a id='line_192'>SECOND GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_193'>That a king’s children should be so convey’d,</a>
<a id='line_194'>So slackly guarded, and the search so slow</a>
<a id='line_195'>That could not trace them!</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>FIRST GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_198'>Howsoe’er ’tis strange,</a>
<a id='line_199'>Or that the negligence may well be laugh’d at,</a>
<a id='line_200'>Yet is it true, sir.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>SECOND GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_203'>I do well believe you.</a>
<a id='line_204'></a>
<a id='line_205'>FIRST GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_206'>We must forbear; here comes the gentleman,</a>
<a id='line_207'>The Queen, and Princess.</a>

<a id='line_213'> Enter Queen, Posthumus and Imogen.</a>
<a id='line_214'></a>
<a id='line_215'>QUEEN.</a>
<a id='line_216'>No, be assur’d you shall not find me, daughter,</a>
<a id='line_217'>After the slander of most stepmothers,</a>
<a id='line_218'>Evil-ey’d unto you. You’re my prisoner, but</a>
<a id='line_219'>Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys</a>
<a id='line_220'>That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,</a>
<a id='line_221'>So soon as I can win th’ offended King,</a>
<a id='line_222'>I will be known your advocate. Marry, yet</a>
<a id='line_223'>The fire of rage is in him, and ’twere good</a>
<a id='line_224'>You lean’d unto his sentence with what patience</a>
<a id='line_225'>Your wisdom may inform you.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>POSTHUMUS.</a>
<a id='line_228'>Please your Highness,</a>
<a id='line_229'>I will from hence today.</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>QUEEN.</a>
<a id='line_232'>You know the peril.</a>
<a id='line_233'>I’ll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying</a>
<a id='line_234'>The pangs of barr’d affections, though the King</a>
<a id='line_235'>Hath charg’d you should not speak together.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'> [_Exit._]</a>
<a id='line_238'></a>
<a id='line_239'>IMOGEN.</a>
<a id='line_240'>O dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant</a>
<a id='line_241'>Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,</a>
<a id='line_242'>I something fear my father’s wrath, but nothing</a>
<a id='line_243'>(Always reserv’d my holy duty) what</a>
<a id='line_244'>His rage can do on me. You must be gone;</a>
<a id='line_245'>And I shall here abide the hourly shot</a>
<a id='line_246'>Of angry eyes, not comforted to live</a>
<a id='line_247'>But that there is this jewel in the world</a>
<a id='line_248'>That I may see again.</a>
<a id='line_249'></a>
<a id='line_250'>POSTHUMUS.</a>
<a id='line_251'>My queen! my mistress!</a>
<a id='line_252'>O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause</a>
<a id='line_253'>To be suspected of more tenderness</a>
<a id='line_254'>Than doth become a man. I will remain</a>
<a id='line_255'>The loyal’st husband that did e’er plight troth;</a>
<a id='line_256'>My residence in Rome at one Philario’s,</a>
<a id='line_257'>Who to my father was a friend, to me</a>
<a id='line_258'>Known but by letter; thither write, my queen,</a>
<a id='line_259'>And with mine eyes I’ll drink the words you send,</a>
<a id='line_260'>Though ink be made of gall.</a>
<a id='line_261'></a>
<a id='line_262'> Enter Queen.</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>QUEEN.</a>
<a id='line_265'>Be brief, I pray you.</a>
<a id='line_266'>If the King come, I shall incur I know not</a>
<a id='line_267'>How much of his displeasure. [_Aside._] Yet I’ll move him</a>
<a id='line_268'>To walk this way. I never do him wrong</a>
<a id='line_269'>But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;</a>
<a id='line_270'>Pays dear for my offences.</a>

<a id='line_280'>Nay, stay a little.</a>
<a id='line_281'>Were you but riding forth to air yourself,</a>
<a id='line_282'>Such parting were too petty. Look here, love:</a>
<a id='line_283'>This diamond was my mother’s; take it, heart;</a>
<a id='line_284'>But keep it till you woo another wife,</a>

<a id='line_675'></a>
<a id='line_676'>POSTHUMUS.</a>
<a id='line_677'>By your pardon, sir. I was then a young traveller; rather shunn’d to go</a>

<a id='line_681'></a>
<a id='line_682'>FRENCHMAN.</a>
<a id='line_683'>Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords, and by such two</a>

<a id='line_689'></a>
<a id='line_690'>FRENCHMAN.</a>
<a id='line_691'>Safely, I think. ’Twas a contention in public, which may, without</a>
<a id='line_692'>contradiction, suffer the report. It was much like an argument that</a>
<a id='line_693'>fell out last night, where each of us fell in praise of our country</a>
<a id='line_694'>mistresses; this gentleman at that time vouching (and upon warrant of</a>
<a id='line_695'>bloody affirmation) his to be more fair, virtuous, wise, chaste,</a>

<a id='line_712'></a>
<a id='line_713'>IACHIMO.</a>
<a id='line_714'>As fair and as good—a kind of hand-in-hand comparison—had been</a>

<a id='line_2273'>Famous in Cæsar’s praises no whit less</a>
<a id='line_2274'>Than in his feats deserving it, for him</a>

<a id='line_2284'>There be many Cæsars ere such another Julius. Britain is a world by</a>

<a id='line_2295'>With sands that will not bear your enemies’ boats</a>
<a id='line_2296'>But suck them up to th’ top-mast. A kind of conquest</a>
<a id='line_2297'>Cæsar made here, but made not here his brag</a>
<a id='line_2298'>Of ‘Came, and saw, and overcame.’ With shame</a>
<a id='line_2299'>(The first that ever touch’d him) he was carried</a>

<a id='line_2301'>(Poor ignorant baubles!) on our terrible seas,</a>
<a id='line_2302'>Like egg-shells mov’d upon their surges, crack’d</a>

<a id='line_5845'>The fingers of the pow’rs above do tune</a>
<a id='line_5846'>The harmony of this peace. The vision</a>
<a id='line_5847'>Which I made known to Lucius ere the stroke</a>
<a id='line_5848'>Of yet this scarce-cold battle, at this instant</a>
<a id='line_5849'>Is full accomplish’d; for the Roman eagle,</a>
<a id='line_5850'>From south to west on wing soaring aloft,</a>
<a id='line_5851'>Lessen’d herself and in the beams o’ th’ sun</a>
<a id='line_5852'>So vanish’d; which foreshow’d our princely eagle,</a>
<a id='line_5853'>Th’ imperial Cæsar, Cæsar, should again unite</a>
<a id='line_5854'>His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,</a>
<a id='line_5855'>Which shines here in the west.</a>

<a id='line_5858'>Laud we the gods;</a>
<a id='line_5859'>And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils</a>
<a id='line_5860'>From our bless’d altars. Publish we this peace</a>
<a id='line_5861'>To all our subjects. Set we forward; let</a>
<a id='line_5862'>A Roman and a British ensign wave</a>
<a id='line_5863'>Friendly together. So through Lud’s Town march;</a>
<a id='line_5864'>And in the temple of great Jupiter</a>
<a id='line_5865'>Our peace we’ll ratify; seal it with feasts.</a>
<a id='line_5866'>Set on there! Never was a war did cease,</a>
<a id='line_5867'>Ere bloody hands were wash’d, with such a peace.</a>
