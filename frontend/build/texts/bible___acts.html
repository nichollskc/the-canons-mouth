                    <a id='line_0'>The Acts of the Apostles</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus</a>
<a id='line_4'>began both to do and teach, 1:2 Until the day in which he was taken</a>
<a id='line_5'>up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto</a>
<a id='line_6'>the apostles whom he had chosen: 1:3 To whom also he shewed himself</a>
<a id='line_7'>alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them</a>
<a id='line_8'>forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_9'>God: 1:4 And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that</a>
<a id='line_10'>they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the</a>
<a id='line_11'>Father, which, saith he, ye have heard of me.</a>
<a id='line_12'></a>
<a id='line_13'>1:5 For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with</a>
<a id='line_14'>the Holy Ghost not many days hence.</a>
<a id='line_15'></a>
<a id='line_16'>1:6 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying,</a>
<a id='line_17'>Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?  1:7</a>
<a id='line_18'>And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the</a>
<a id='line_19'>seasons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</a>
<a id='line_20'></a>
<a id='line_21'>1:8 But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon</a>
<a id='line_22'>you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all</a>
<a id='line_23'>Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'>1:9 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was</a>
<a id='line_26'>taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.</a>
<a id='line_27'></a>
<a id='line_28'>1:10 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up,</a>
<a id='line_29'>behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; 1:11 Which also said,</a>
<a id='line_30'>Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same</a>
<a id='line_31'>Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like</a>
<a id='line_32'>manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.</a>
<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'>1:12 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet,</a>
<a id='line_35'>which is from Jerusalem a sabbath dayâ€™s journey.</a>
<a id='line_36'></a>
<a id='line_37'>1:13 And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room,</a>
<a id='line_38'>where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and</a>
<a id='line_39'>Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon</a>
<a id='line_40'>Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James.</a>
<a id='line_41'></a>
<a id='line_42'>1:14 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication,</a>
<a id='line_43'>with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</a>
<a id='line_44'></a>
<a id='line_45'>1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples,</a>
<a id='line_46'>and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and</a>
<a id='line_47'>twenty,) 1:16 Men and brethren, this scripture must needs have been</a>
<a id='line_48'>fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spake before</a>
<a id='line_49'>concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_50'></a>
<a id='line_51'>1:17 For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this</a>
<a id='line_52'>ministry.</a>
<a id='line_53'></a>
<a id='line_54'>1:18 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and</a>
<a id='line_55'>falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels</a>
<a id='line_56'>gushed out.</a>
<a id='line_57'></a>
<a id='line_58'>1:19 And it was known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as</a>
<a id='line_59'>that field is called in their proper tongue, Aceldama, that is to say,</a>
<a id='line_60'>The field of blood.</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>1:20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be</a>
<a id='line_63'>desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and his bishoprick let another</a>
<a id='line_64'>take.</a>
<a id='line_65'></a>
<a id='line_66'>1:21 Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time</a>
<a id='line_67'>that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, 1:22 Beginning from the</a>
<a id='line_68'>baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must</a>
<a id='line_69'>one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.</a>
<a id='line_70'></a>
<a id='line_71'>1:23 And they appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed</a>
<a id='line_72'>Justus, and Matthias.</a>
<a id='line_73'></a>
<a id='line_74'>1:24 And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts</a>
<a id='line_75'>of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen, 1:25 That he</a>
<a id='line_76'>may take part of this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by</a>
<a id='line_77'>transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>1:26 And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias;</a>
<a id='line_80'>and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</a>
<a id='line_81'></a>
<a id='line_82'>2:1 And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with</a>
<a id='line_83'>one accord in one place.</a>
<a id='line_84'></a>
<a id='line_85'>2:2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty</a>
<a id='line_86'>wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.</a>
<a id='line_87'></a>
<a id='line_88'>2:3 And there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire, and</a>
<a id='line_89'>it sat upon each of them.</a>
<a id='line_90'></a>
<a id='line_91'>2:4 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak</a>
<a id='line_92'>with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>2:5 And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of</a>
<a id='line_95'>every nation under heaven.</a>
<a id='line_96'></a>
<a id='line_97'>2:6 Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and</a>
<a id='line_98'>were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own</a>
<a id='line_99'>language.</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>2:7 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another,</a>
<a id='line_102'>Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?  2:8 And how hear we</a>
<a id='line_103'>every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born?  2:9 Parthians, and</a>
<a id='line_104'>Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea,</a>
<a id='line_105'>and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, 2:10 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in</a>
<a id='line_106'>Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_107'>Jews and proselytes, 2:11 Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak</a>
<a id='line_108'>in our tongues the wonderful works of God.</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>
<a id='line_110'>2:12 And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one to</a>
<a id='line_111'>another, What meaneth this?  2:13 Others mocking said, These men are</a>
<a id='line_112'>full of new wine.</a>
<a id='line_113'></a>
<a id='line_114'>2:14 But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and</a>
<a id='line_115'>said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_116'>be this known unto you, and hearken to my words: 2:15 For these are</a>
<a id='line_117'>not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is but the third hour of the</a>
<a id='line_118'>day.</a>
<a id='line_119'></a>
<a id='line_120'>2:16 But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel; 2:17 And</a>
<a id='line_121'>it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of</a>
<a id='line_122'>my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall</a>
<a id='line_123'>prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall</a>
<a id='line_124'>dream dreams: 2:18 And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will</a>
<a id='line_125'>pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy: 2:19 And</a>
<a id='line_126'>I will shew wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath;</a>
<a id='line_127'>blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke: 2:20 The sun shall be turned</a>
<a id='line_128'>into darkness, and the moon into blood, before the great and notable</a>
<a id='line_129'>day of the Lord come: 2:21 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever</a>
<a id='line_130'>shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'>2:22 Ye men of Israel, hear these words; Jesus of Nazareth, a man</a>
<a id='line_133'>approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God</a>
<a id='line_134'>did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know: 2:23 Him,</a>
<a id='line_135'>being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God,</a>
<a id='line_136'>ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain: 2:24 Whom</a>
<a id='line_137'>God hath raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was</a>
<a id='line_138'>not possible that he should be holden of it.</a>
<a id='line_139'></a>
<a id='line_140'>2:25 For David speaketh concerning him, I foresaw the Lord always</a>
<a id='line_141'>before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be</a>
<a id='line_142'>moved: 2:26 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad;</a>
<a id='line_143'>moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope: 2:27 Because thou wilt not</a>
<a id='line_144'>leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see</a>
<a id='line_145'>corruption.</a>
<a id='line_146'></a>
<a id='line_147'>2:28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me</a>
<a id='line_148'>full of joy with thy countenance.</a>
<a id='line_149'></a>
<a id='line_150'>2:29 Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch</a>
<a id='line_151'>David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us</a>
<a id='line_152'>unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>2:30 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an</a>
<a id='line_155'>oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh,</a>
<a id='line_156'>he would raise up Christ to sit on his throne; 2:31 He seeing this</a>
<a id='line_157'>before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left</a>
<a id='line_158'>in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.</a>
<a id='line_159'></a>
<a id='line_160'>2:32 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>2:33 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having</a>
<a id='line_163'>received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed</a>
<a id='line_164'>forth this, which ye now see and hear.</a>
<a id='line_165'></a>
<a id='line_166'>2:34 For David is not ascended into the heavens: but he saith himself,</a>
<a id='line_167'>The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, 2:35 Until I</a>
<a id='line_168'>make thy foes thy footstool.</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>2:36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God</a>
<a id='line_171'>hath made the same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and</a>
<a id='line_172'>Christ.</a>
<a id='line_173'></a>
<a id='line_174'>2:37 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and</a>
<a id='line_175'>said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren,</a>
<a id='line_176'>what shall we do?  2:38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be</a>
<a id='line_177'>baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the</a>
<a id='line_178'>remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>2:39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all</a>
<a id='line_181'>that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.</a>
<a id='line_182'></a>
<a id='line_183'>2:40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save</a>
<a id='line_184'>yourselves from this untoward generation.</a>
<a id='line_185'></a>
<a id='line_186'>2:41 Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the</a>
<a id='line_187'>same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls.</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>2:42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostlesâ€™ doctrine and</a>
<a id='line_190'>fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.</a>
<a id='line_191'></a>
<a id='line_192'>2:43 And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were</a>
<a id='line_193'>done by the apostles.</a>
<a id='line_194'></a>
<a id='line_195'>2:44 And all that believed were together, and had all things common;</a>
<a id='line_196'>2:45 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men,</a>
<a id='line_197'>as every man had need.</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>2:46 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and</a>
<a id='line_200'>breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness</a>
<a id='line_201'>and singleness of heart, 2:47 Praising God, and having favour with all</a>
<a id='line_202'>the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be</a>
<a id='line_203'>saved.</a>
<a id='line_204'></a>
<a id='line_205'>3:1 Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of</a>
<a id='line_206'>prayer, being the ninth hour.</a>
<a id='line_207'></a>
<a id='line_208'>3:2 And a certain man lame from his motherâ€™s womb was carried, whom</a>
<a id='line_209'>they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful,</a>
<a id='line_210'>to ask alms of them that entered into the temple; 3:3 Who seeing Peter</a>
<a id='line_211'>and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.</a>
<a id='line_212'></a>
<a id='line_213'>3:4 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on</a>
<a id='line_214'>us.</a>
<a id='line_215'></a>
<a id='line_216'>3:5 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something of</a>
<a id='line_217'>them.</a>
<a id='line_218'></a>
<a id='line_219'>3:6 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have</a>
<a id='line_220'>give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</a>
<a id='line_221'></a>
<a id='line_222'>3:7 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and</a>
<a id='line_223'>immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.</a>
<a id='line_224'></a>
<a id='line_225'>3:8 And he leaping up stood, and walked, and entered with them into</a>
<a id='line_226'>the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>3:9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God: 3:10 And they</a>
<a id='line_229'>knew that it was he which sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the</a>
<a id='line_230'>temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which</a>
<a id='line_231'>had happened unto him.</a>
<a id='line_232'></a>
<a id='line_233'>3:11 And as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John, all the</a>
<a id='line_234'>people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomonâ€™s,</a>
<a id='line_235'>greatly wondering.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>3:12 And when Peter saw it, he answered unto the people, Ye men of</a>
<a id='line_238'>Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as</a>
<a id='line_239'>though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?</a>
<a id='line_240'>3:13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our</a>
<a id='line_241'>fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and</a>
<a id='line_242'>denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let</a>
<a id='line_243'>him go.</a>
<a id='line_244'></a>
<a id='line_245'>3:14 But ye denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer</a>
<a id='line_246'>to be granted unto you; 3:15 And killed the Prince of life, whom God</a>
<a id='line_247'>hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.</a>
<a id='line_248'></a>
<a id='line_249'>3:16 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong,</a>
<a id='line_250'>whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is by him hath given him</a>
<a id='line_251'>this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.</a>
<a id='line_252'></a>
<a id='line_253'>3:17 And now, brethren, I wot that through ignorance ye did it, as did</a>
<a id='line_254'>also your rulers.</a>
<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'>3:18 But those things, which God before had shewed by the mouth of all</a>
<a id='line_257'>his prophets, that Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>3:19 Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be</a>
<a id='line_260'>blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence</a>
<a id='line_261'>of the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_262'></a>
<a id='line_263'>3:20 And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached unto</a>
<a id='line_264'>you: 3:21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution</a>
<a id='line_265'>of all things, which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy</a>
<a id='line_266'>prophets since the world began.</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>3:22 For Moses truly said unto the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord</a>
<a id='line_269'>your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall</a>
<a id='line_270'>ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.</a>
<a id='line_271'></a>
<a id='line_272'>3:23 And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear</a>
<a id='line_273'>that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.</a>
<a id='line_274'></a>
<a id='line_275'>3:24 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow</a>
<a id='line_276'>after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.</a>
<a id='line_277'></a>
<a id='line_278'>3:25 Ye are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which</a>
<a id='line_279'>God made with our fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall</a>
<a id='line_280'>all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</a>
<a id='line_281'></a>
<a id='line_282'>3:26 Unto you first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to</a>
<a id='line_283'>bless you, in turning away every one of you from his iniquities.</a>
<a id='line_284'></a>
<a id='line_285'>4:1 And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of</a>
<a id='line_286'>the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them, 4:2 Being grieved that</a>
<a id='line_287'>they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection</a>
<a id='line_288'>from the dead.</a>
<a id='line_289'></a>
<a id='line_290'>4:3 And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next</a>
<a id='line_291'>day: for it was now eventide.</a>
<a id='line_292'></a>
<a id='line_293'>4:4 Howbeit many of them which heard the word believed; and the number</a>
<a id='line_294'>of the men was about five thousand.</a>
<a id='line_295'></a>
<a id='line_296'>4:5 And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders,</a>
<a id='line_297'>and scribes, 4:6 And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John,</a>
<a id='line_298'>and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest,</a>
<a id='line_299'>were gathered together at Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_300'></a>
<a id='line_301'>4:7 And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, By what</a>
<a id='line_302'>power, or by what name, have ye done this?  4:8 Then Peter, filled</a>
<a id='line_303'>with the Holy Ghost, said unto them, Ye rulers of the people, and</a>
<a id='line_304'>elders of Israel, 4:9 If we this day be examined of the good deed done</a>
<a id='line_305'>to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole; 4:10 Be it known</a>
<a id='line_306'>unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of</a>
<a id='line_307'>Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the</a>
<a id='line_308'>dead, even by him doth this man stand here before you whole.</a>
<a id='line_309'></a>
<a id='line_310'>4:11 This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which</a>
<a id='line_311'>is become the head of the corner.</a>
<a id='line_312'></a>
<a id='line_313'>4:12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other</a>
<a id='line_314'>name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.</a>
<a id='line_315'></a>
<a id='line_316'>4:13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived</a>
<a id='line_317'>that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they</a>
<a id='line_318'>took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_319'></a>
<a id='line_320'>4:14 And beholding the man which was healed standing with them, they</a>
<a id='line_321'>could say nothing against it.</a>
<a id='line_322'></a>
<a id='line_323'>4:15 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council,</a>
<a id='line_324'>they conferred among themselves, 4:16 Saying, What shall we do to</a>
<a id='line_325'>these men? for that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is</a>
<a id='line_326'>manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it.</a>
<a id='line_327'></a>
<a id='line_328'>4:17 But that it spread no further among the people, let us straitly</a>
<a id='line_329'>threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.</a>
<a id='line_330'></a>
<a id='line_331'>4:18 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all nor</a>
<a id='line_332'>teach in the name of Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_333'></a>
<a id='line_334'>4:19 But Peter and John answered and said unto them, Whether it be</a>
<a id='line_335'>right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God,</a>
<a id='line_336'>judge ye.</a>
<a id='line_337'></a>
<a id='line_338'>4:20 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</a>
<a id='line_339'></a>
<a id='line_340'>4:21 So when they had further threatened them, they let them go,</a>
<a id='line_341'>finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people: for</a>
<a id='line_342'>all men glorified God for that which was done.</a>
<a id='line_343'></a>
<a id='line_344'>4:22 For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of</a>
<a id='line_345'>healing was shewed.</a>
<a id='line_346'></a>
<a id='line_347'>4:23 And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported</a>
<a id='line_348'>all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.</a>
<a id='line_349'></a>
<a id='line_350'>4:24 And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with</a>
<a id='line_351'>one accord, and said, Lord, thou art God, which hast made heaven, and</a>
<a id='line_352'>earth, and the sea, and all that in them is: 4:25 Who by the mouth of</a>
<a id='line_353'>thy servant David hast said, Why did the heathen rage, and the people</a>
<a id='line_354'>imagine vain things?  4:26 The kings of the earth stood up, and the</a>
<a id='line_355'>rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his</a>
<a id='line_356'>Christ.</a>
<a id='line_357'></a>
<a id='line_358'>4:27 For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast</a>
<a id='line_359'>anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the</a>
<a id='line_360'>people of Israel, were gathered together, 4:28 For to do whatsoever</a>
<a id='line_361'>thy hand and thy counsel determined before to be done.</a>
<a id='line_362'></a>
<a id='line_363'>4:29 And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy</a>
<a id='line_364'>servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word, 4:30 By</a>
<a id='line_365'>stretching forth thine hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be</a>
<a id='line_366'>done by the name of thy holy child Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_367'></a>
<a id='line_368'>4:31 And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were</a>
<a id='line_369'>assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and</a>
<a id='line_370'>they spake the word of God with boldness.</a>
<a id='line_371'></a>
<a id='line_372'>4:32 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of</a>
<a id='line_373'>one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he</a>
<a id='line_374'>possessed was his own; but they had all things common.</a>
<a id='line_375'></a>
<a id='line_376'>4:33 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the</a>
<a id='line_377'>resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great grace was upon them all.</a>
<a id='line_378'></a>
<a id='line_379'>4:34 Neither was there any among them that lacked: for as many as were</a>
<a id='line_380'>possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the</a>
<a id='line_381'>things that were sold, 4:35 And laid them down at the apostlesâ€™ feet:</a>
<a id='line_382'>and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.</a>
<a id='line_383'></a>
<a id='line_384'>4:36 And Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is,</a>
<a id='line_385'>being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, and of the</a>
<a id='line_386'>country of Cyprus, 4:37 Having land, sold it, and brought the money,</a>
<a id='line_387'>and laid it at the apostlesâ€™ feet.</a>
<a id='line_388'></a>
<a id='line_389'>5:1 But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a</a>
<a id='line_390'>possession, 5:2 And kept back part of the price, his wife also being</a>
<a id='line_391'>privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostlesâ€™</a>
<a id='line_392'>feet.</a>
<a id='line_393'></a>
<a id='line_394'>5:3 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie</a>
<a id='line_395'>to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?</a>
<a id='line_396'>5:4 Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold,</a>
<a id='line_397'>was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in</a>
<a id='line_398'>thine heart?  thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.</a>
<a id='line_399'></a>
<a id='line_400'>5:5 And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost:</a>
<a id='line_401'>and great fear came on all them that heard these things.</a>
<a id='line_402'></a>
<a id='line_403'>5:6 And the young men arose, wound him up, and carried him out, and</a>
<a id='line_404'>buried him.</a>
<a id='line_405'></a>
<a id='line_406'>5:7 And it was about the space of three hours after, when his wife,</a>
<a id='line_407'>not knowing what was done, came in.</a>
<a id='line_408'></a>
<a id='line_409'>5:8 And Peter answered unto her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for</a>
<a id='line_410'>so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.</a>
<a id='line_411'></a>
<a id='line_412'>5:9 Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together</a>
<a id='line_413'>to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them which have</a>
<a id='line_414'>buried thy husband are at the door, and shall carry thee out.</a>
<a id='line_415'></a>
<a id='line_416'>5:10 Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and yielded up the</a>
<a id='line_417'>ghost: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying</a>
<a id='line_418'>her forth, buried her by her husband.</a>
<a id='line_419'></a>
<a id='line_420'>5:11 And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as</a>
<a id='line_421'>heard these things.</a>
<a id='line_422'></a>
<a id='line_423'>5:12 And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders</a>
<a id='line_424'>wrought among the people; (and they were all with one accord in</a>
<a id='line_425'>Solomonâ€™s porch.</a>
<a id='line_426'></a>
<a id='line_427'>5:13 And of the rest durst no man join himself to them: but the people</a>
<a id='line_428'>magnified them.</a>
<a id='line_429'></a>
<a id='line_430'>5:14 And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of</a>
<a id='line_431'>men and women.)  5:15 Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into</a>
<a id='line_432'>the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the</a>
<a id='line_433'>shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.</a>
<a id='line_434'></a>
<a id='line_435'>5:16 There came also a multitude out of the cities round about unto</a>
<a id='line_436'>Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean</a>
<a id='line_437'>spirits: and they were healed every one.</a>
<a id='line_438'></a>
<a id='line_439'>5:17 Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him,</a>
<a id='line_440'>(which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with</a>
<a id='line_441'>indignation, 5:18 And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them</a>
<a id='line_442'>in the common prison.</a>
<a id='line_443'></a>
<a id='line_444'>5:19 But the angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and</a>
<a id='line_445'>brought them forth, and said, 5:20 Go, stand and speak in the temple</a>
<a id='line_446'>to the people all the words of this life.</a>
<a id='line_447'></a>
<a id='line_448'>5:21 And when they heard that, they entered into the temple early in</a>
<a id='line_449'>the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were</a>
<a id='line_450'>with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the</a>
<a id='line_451'>children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</a>
<a id='line_452'></a>
<a id='line_453'>5:22 But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison,</a>
<a id='line_454'>they returned and told, 5:23 Saying, The prison truly found we shut</a>
<a id='line_455'>with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors:</a>
<a id='line_456'>but when we had opened, we found no man within.</a>
<a id='line_457'></a>
<a id='line_458'>5:24 Now when the high priest and the captain of the temple and the</a>
<a id='line_459'>chief priests heard these things, they doubted of them whereunto this</a>
<a id='line_460'>would grow.</a>
<a id='line_461'></a>
<a id='line_462'>5:25 Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put</a>
<a id='line_463'>in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.</a>
<a id='line_464'></a>
<a id='line_465'>5:26 Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without</a>
<a id='line_466'>violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been</a>
<a id='line_467'>stoned.</a>
<a id='line_468'></a>
<a id='line_469'>5:27 And when they had brought them, they set them before the council:</a>
<a id='line_470'>and the high priest asked them, 5:28 Saying, Did not we straitly</a>
<a id='line_471'>command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye</a>
<a id='line_472'>have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and intend to bring this</a>
<a id='line_473'>manâ€™s blood upon us.</a>
<a id='line_474'></a>
<a id='line_475'>5:29 Then Peter and the other apostles answered and said, We ought to</a>
<a id='line_476'>obey God rather than men.</a>
<a id='line_477'></a>
<a id='line_478'>5:30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged</a>
<a id='line_479'>on a tree.</a>
<a id='line_480'></a>
<a id='line_481'>5:31 Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a</a>
<a id='line_482'>Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.</a>
<a id='line_483'></a>
<a id='line_484'>5:32 And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy</a>
<a id='line_485'>Ghost, whom God hath given to them that obey him.</a>
<a id='line_486'></a>
<a id='line_487'>5:33 When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and took</a>
<a id='line_488'>counsel to slay them.</a>
<a id='line_489'></a>
<a id='line_490'>5:34 Then stood there up one in the council, a Pharisee, named</a>
<a id='line_491'>Gamaliel, a doctor of the law, had in reputation among all the people,</a>
<a id='line_492'>and commanded to put the apostles forth a little space; 5:35 And said</a>
<a id='line_493'>unto them, Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to</a>
<a id='line_494'>do as touching these men.</a>
<a id='line_495'></a>
<a id='line_496'>5:36 For before these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be</a>
<a id='line_497'>somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined</a>
<a id='line_498'>themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were</a>
<a id='line_499'>scattered, and brought to nought.</a>
<a id='line_500'></a>
<a id='line_501'>5:37 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the</a>
<a id='line_502'>taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and</a>
<a id='line_503'>all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.</a>
<a id='line_504'></a>
<a id='line_505'>5:38 And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them</a>
<a id='line_506'>alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to</a>
<a id='line_507'>nought: 5:39 But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply</a>
<a id='line_508'>ye be found even to fight against God.</a>
<a id='line_509'></a>
<a id='line_510'>5:40 And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles,</a>
<a id='line_511'>and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name</a>
<a id='line_512'>of Jesus, and let them go.</a>
<a id='line_513'></a>
<a id='line_514'>5:41 And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing</a>
<a id='line_515'>that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.</a>
<a id='line_516'></a>
<a id='line_517'>5:42 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to</a>
<a id='line_518'>teach and preach Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_519'></a>
<a id='line_520'>6:1 And in those days, when the number of the disciples was</a>
<a id='line_521'>multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the</a>
<a id='line_522'>Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily</a>
<a id='line_523'>ministration.</a>
<a id='line_524'></a>
<a id='line_525'>6:2 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples unto them,</a>
<a id='line_526'>and said, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and</a>
<a id='line_527'>serve tables.</a>
<a id='line_528'></a>
<a id='line_529'>6:3 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest</a>
<a id='line_530'>report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over</a>
<a id='line_531'>this business.</a>
<a id='line_532'></a>
<a id='line_533'>6:4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the</a>
<a id='line_534'>ministry of the word.</a>
<a id='line_535'></a>
<a id='line_536'>6:5 And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose</a>
<a id='line_537'>Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and</a>
<a id='line_538'>Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a</a>
<a id='line_539'>proselyte of Antioch: 6:6 Whom they set before the apostles: and when</a>
<a id='line_540'>they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</a>
<a id='line_541'></a>
<a id='line_542'>6:7 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples</a>
<a id='line_543'>multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests</a>
<a id='line_544'>were obedient to the faith.</a>
<a id='line_545'></a>
<a id='line_546'>6:8 And Stephen, full of faith and power, did great wonders and</a>
<a id='line_547'>miracles among the people.</a>
<a id='line_548'></a>
<a id='line_549'>6:9 Then there arose certain of the synagogue, which is called the</a>
<a id='line_550'>synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of</a>
<a id='line_551'>them of Cilicia and of Asia, disputing with Stephen.</a>
<a id='line_552'></a>
<a id='line_553'>6:10 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by</a>
<a id='line_554'>which he spake.</a>
<a id='line_555'></a>
<a id='line_556'>6:11 Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak</a>
<a id='line_557'>blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.</a>
<a id='line_558'></a>
<a id='line_559'>6:12 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes,</a>
<a id='line_560'>and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council,</a>
<a id='line_561'>6:13 And set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to</a>
<a id='line_562'>speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law: 6:14 For</a>
<a id='line_563'>we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this</a>
<a id='line_564'>place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.</a>
<a id='line_565'></a>
<a id='line_566'>6:15 And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw</a>
<a id='line_567'>his face as it had been the face of an angel.</a>
<a id='line_568'></a>
<a id='line_569'>7:1 Then said the high priest, Are these things so?  7:2 And he said,</a>
<a id='line_570'>Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto</a>
<a id='line_571'>our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in</a>
<a id='line_572'>Charran, 7:3 And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from</a>
<a id='line_573'>thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee.</a>
<a id='line_574'></a>
<a id='line_575'>7:4 Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in</a>
<a id='line_576'>Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him</a>
<a id='line_577'>into this land, wherein ye now dwell.</a>
<a id='line_578'></a>
<a id='line_579'>7:5 And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set</a>
<a id='line_580'>his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a</a>
<a id='line_581'>possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.</a>
<a id='line_582'></a>
<a id='line_583'>7:6 And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a</a>
<a id='line_584'>strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and</a>
<a id='line_585'>entreat them evil four hundred years.</a>
<a id='line_586'></a>
<a id='line_587'>7:7 And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said</a>
<a id='line_588'>God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.</a>
<a id='line_589'></a>
<a id='line_590'>7:8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat</a>
<a id='line_591'>Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and</a>
<a id='line_592'>Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs.</a>
<a id='line_593'></a>
<a id='line_594'>7:9 And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but</a>
<a id='line_595'>God was with him, 7:10 And delivered him out of all his afflictions,</a>
<a id='line_596'>and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt;</a>
<a id='line_597'>and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.</a>
<a id='line_598'></a>
<a id='line_599'>7:11 Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Chanaan,</a>
<a id='line_600'>and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.</a>
<a id='line_601'></a>
<a id='line_602'>7:12 But when Jacob heard that there was corn in Egypt, he sent out</a>
<a id='line_603'>our fathers first.</a>
<a id='line_604'></a>
<a id='line_605'>7:13 And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren; and</a>
<a id='line_606'>Josephâ€™s kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.</a>
<a id='line_607'></a>
<a id='line_608'>7:14 Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his</a>
<a id='line_609'>kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.</a>
<a id='line_610'></a>
<a id='line_611'>7:15 So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,</a>
<a id='line_612'>7:16 And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that</a>
<a id='line_613'>Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of</a>
<a id='line_614'>Sychem.</a>
<a id='line_615'></a>
<a id='line_616'>7:17 But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn</a>
<a id='line_617'>to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, 7:18 Till another</a>
<a id='line_618'>king arose, which knew not Joseph.</a>
<a id='line_619'></a>
<a id='line_620'>7:19 The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our</a>
<a id='line_621'>fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they</a>
<a id='line_622'>might not live.</a>
<a id='line_623'></a>
<a id='line_624'>7:20 In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and</a>
<a id='line_625'>nourished up in his fatherâ€™s house three months: 7:21 And when he was</a>
<a id='line_626'>cast out, Pharaohâ€™s daughter took him up, and nourished him for her</a>
<a id='line_627'>own son.</a>
<a id='line_628'></a>
<a id='line_629'>7:22 And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was</a>
<a id='line_630'>mighty in words and in deeds.</a>
<a id='line_631'></a>
<a id='line_632'>7:23 And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to</a>
<a id='line_633'>visit his brethren the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_634'></a>
<a id='line_635'>7:24 And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged</a>
<a id='line_636'>him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian: 7:25 For he supposed</a>
<a id='line_637'>his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would</a>
<a id='line_638'>deliver them: but they understood not.</a>
<a id='line_639'></a>
<a id='line_640'>7:26 And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and</a>
<a id='line_641'>would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why</a>
<a id='line_642'>do ye wrong one to another?  7:27 But he that did his neighbour wrong</a>
<a id='line_643'>thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?</a>
<a id='line_644'>7:28 Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?  7:29</a>
<a id='line_645'>Then fled Moses at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of</a>
<a id='line_646'>Madian, where he begat two sons.</a>
<a id='line_647'></a>
<a id='line_648'>7:30 And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the</a>
<a id='line_649'>wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a</a>
<a id='line_650'>bush.</a>
<a id='line_651'></a>
<a id='line_652'>7:31 When Moses saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near</a>
<a id='line_653'>to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him, 7:32 Saying, I am</a>
<a id='line_654'>the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and</a>
<a id='line_655'>the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and durst not behold.</a>
<a id='line_656'></a>
<a id='line_657'>7:33 Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for</a>
<a id='line_658'>the place where thou standest is holy ground.</a>
<a id='line_659'></a>
<a id='line_660'>7:34 I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in</a>
<a id='line_661'>Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver</a>
<a id='line_662'>them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_663'></a>
<a id='line_664'>7:35 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a</a>
<a id='line_665'>judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand</a>
<a id='line_666'>of the angel which appeared to him in the bush.</a>
<a id='line_667'></a>
<a id='line_668'>7:36 He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs</a>
<a id='line_669'>in the land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty</a>
<a id='line_670'>years.</a>
<a id='line_671'></a>
<a id='line_672'>7:37 This is that Moses, which said unto the children of Israel, A</a>
<a id='line_673'>prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren,</a>
<a id='line_674'>like unto me; him shall ye hear.</a>
<a id='line_675'></a>
<a id='line_676'>7:38 This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the</a>
<a id='line_677'>angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who</a>
<a id='line_678'>received the lively oracles to give unto us: 7:39 To whom our fathers</a>
<a id='line_679'>would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned</a>
<a id='line_680'>back again into Egypt, 7:40 Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go</a>
<a id='line_681'>before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of</a>
<a id='line_682'>Egypt, we wot not what is become of him.</a>
<a id='line_683'></a>
<a id='line_684'>7:41 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto</a>
<a id='line_685'>the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.</a>
<a id='line_686'></a>
<a id='line_687'>7:42 Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven;</a>
<a id='line_688'>as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_689'>have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of</a>
<a id='line_690'>forty years in the wilderness?  7:43 Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of</a>
<a id='line_691'>Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to</a>
<a id='line_692'>worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.</a>
<a id='line_693'></a>
<a id='line_694'>7:44 Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as</a>
<a id='line_695'>he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it</a>
<a id='line_696'>according to the fashion that he had seen.</a>
<a id='line_697'></a>
<a id='line_698'>7:45 Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into</a>
<a id='line_699'>the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of</a>
<a id='line_700'>our fathers, unto the days of David; 7:46 Who found favour before God,</a>
<a id='line_701'>and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob.</a>
<a id='line_702'></a>
<a id='line_703'>7:47 But Solomon built him an house.</a>
<a id='line_704'></a>
<a id='line_705'>7:48 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as</a>
<a id='line_706'>saith the prophet, 7:49 Heaven is my throne, and earth is my</a>
<a id='line_707'>footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the</a>
<a id='line_708'>place of my rest?  7:50 Hath not my hand made all these things?  7:51</a>
<a id='line_709'>Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always</a>
<a id='line_710'>resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye.</a>
<a id='line_711'></a>
<a id='line_712'>7:52 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they</a>
<a id='line_713'>have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of</a>
<a id='line_714'>whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: 7:53 Who have</a>
<a id='line_715'>received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it.</a>
<a id='line_716'></a>
<a id='line_717'>7:54 When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and</a>
<a id='line_718'>they gnashed on him with their teeth.</a>
<a id='line_719'></a>
<a id='line_720'>7:55 But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into</a>
<a id='line_721'>heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand</a>
<a id='line_722'>of God, 7:56 And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son</a>
<a id='line_723'>of man standing on the right hand of God.</a>
<a id='line_724'></a>
<a id='line_725'>7:57 Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears,</a>
<a id='line_726'>and ran upon him with one accord, 7:58 And cast him out of the city,</a>
<a id='line_727'>and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young</a>
<a id='line_728'>manâ€™s feet, whose name was Saul.</a>
<a id='line_729'></a>
<a id='line_730'>7:59 And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord</a>
<a id='line_731'>Jesus, receive my spirit.</a>
<a id='line_732'></a>
<a id='line_733'>7:60 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not</a>
<a id='line_734'>this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.</a>
<a id='line_735'></a>
<a id='line_736'>8:1 And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was</a>
<a id='line_737'>a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and</a>
<a id='line_738'>they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and</a>
<a id='line_739'>Samaria, except the apostles.</a>
<a id='line_740'></a>
<a id='line_741'>8:2 And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great</a>
<a id='line_742'>lamentation over him.</a>
<a id='line_743'></a>
<a id='line_744'>8:3 As for Saul, he made havock of the church, entering into every</a>
<a id='line_745'>house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.</a>
<a id='line_746'></a>
<a id='line_747'>8:4 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where</a>
<a id='line_748'>preaching the word.</a>
<a id='line_749'></a>
<a id='line_750'>8:5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ</a>
<a id='line_751'>unto them.</a>
<a id='line_752'></a>
<a id='line_753'>8:6 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which</a>
<a id='line_754'>Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.</a>
<a id='line_755'></a>
<a id='line_756'>8:7 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that</a>
<a id='line_757'>were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were</a>
<a id='line_758'>lame, were healed.</a>
<a id='line_759'></a>
<a id='line_760'>8:8 And there was great joy in that city.</a>
<a id='line_761'></a>
<a id='line_762'>8:9 But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the</a>
<a id='line_763'>same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving</a>
<a id='line_764'>out that himself was some great one: 8:10 To whom they all gave heed,</a>
<a id='line_765'>from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of</a>
<a id='line_766'>God.</a>
<a id='line_767'></a>
<a id='line_768'>8:11 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had</a>
<a id='line_769'>bewitched them with sorceries.</a>
<a id='line_770'></a>
<a id='line_771'>8:12 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the</a>
<a id='line_772'>kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both</a>
<a id='line_773'>men and women.</a>
<a id='line_774'></a>
<a id='line_775'>8:13 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he</a>
<a id='line_776'>continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs</a>
<a id='line_777'>which were done.</a>
<a id='line_778'></a>
<a id='line_779'>8:14 Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria</a>
<a id='line_780'>had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John: 8:15</a>
<a id='line_781'>Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might</a>
<a id='line_782'>receive the Holy Ghost: 8:16 (For as yet he was fallen upon none of</a>
<a id='line_783'>them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.)  8:17</a>
<a id='line_784'>Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_785'></a>
<a id='line_786'>8:18 And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostlesâ€™ hands</a>
<a id='line_787'>the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, 8:19 Saying, Give me</a>
<a id='line_788'>also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the</a>
<a id='line_789'>Holy Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_790'></a>
<a id='line_791'>8:20 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou</a>
<a id='line_792'>hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.</a>
<a id='line_793'></a>
<a id='line_794'>8:21 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is</a>
<a id='line_795'>not right in the sight of God.</a>
<a id='line_796'></a>
<a id='line_797'>8:22 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps</a>
<a id='line_798'>the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee.</a>
<a id='line_799'></a>
<a id='line_800'>8:23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in</a>
<a id='line_801'>the bond of iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_802'></a>
<a id='line_803'>8:24 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that</a>
<a id='line_804'>none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.</a>
<a id='line_805'></a>
<a id='line_806'>8:25 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the</a>
<a id='line_807'>Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages</a>
<a id='line_808'>of the Samaritans.</a>
<a id='line_809'></a>
<a id='line_810'>8:26 And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and</a>
<a id='line_811'>go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto</a>
<a id='line_812'>Gaza, which is desert.</a>
<a id='line_813'></a>
<a id='line_814'>8:27 And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch</a>
<a id='line_815'>of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the</a>
<a id='line_816'>charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship,</a>
<a id='line_817'>8:28 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the</a>
<a id='line_818'>prophet.</a>
<a id='line_819'></a>
<a id='line_820'>8:29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to</a>
<a id='line_821'>this chariot.</a>
<a id='line_822'></a>
<a id='line_823'>8:30 And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet</a>
<a id='line_824'>Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?  8:31 And he</a>
<a id='line_825'>said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired</a>
<a id='line_826'>Philip that he would come up and sit with him.</a>
<a id='line_827'></a>
<a id='line_828'>8:32 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as</a>
<a id='line_829'>a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so</a>
<a id='line_830'>opened he not his mouth: 8:33 In his humiliation his judgment was</a>
<a id='line_831'>taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is</a>
<a id='line_832'>taken from the earth.</a>
<a id='line_833'></a>
<a id='line_834'>8:34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom</a>
<a id='line_835'>speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?  8:35</a>
<a id='line_836'>Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and</a>
<a id='line_837'>preached unto him Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_838'></a>
<a id='line_839'>8:36 And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water:</a>
<a id='line_840'>and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be</a>
<a id='line_841'>baptized?  8:37 And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine</a>
<a id='line_842'>heart, thou mayest.</a>
<a id='line_843'></a>
<a id='line_844'>And he answered and said, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of</a>
<a id='line_845'>God.</a>
<a id='line_846'></a>
<a id='line_847'>8:38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down</a>
<a id='line_848'>both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.</a>
<a id='line_849'></a>
<a id='line_850'>8:39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the</a>
<a id='line_851'>Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went</a>
<a id='line_852'>on his way rejoicing.</a>
<a id='line_853'></a>
<a id='line_854'>8:40 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached</a>
<a id='line_855'>in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.</a>
<a id='line_856'></a>
<a id='line_857'>9:1 And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the</a>
<a id='line_858'>disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, 9:2 And desired of</a>
<a id='line_859'>him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of</a>
<a id='line_860'>this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound</a>
<a id='line_861'>unto Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_862'></a>
<a id='line_863'>9:3 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there</a>
<a id='line_864'>shined round about him a light from heaven: 9:4 And he fell to the</a>
<a id='line_865'>earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest</a>
<a id='line_866'>thou me?  9:5 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am</a>
<a id='line_867'>Jesus whom thou persecutest: it is hard for thee to kick against the</a>
<a id='line_868'>pricks.</a>
<a id='line_869'></a>
<a id='line_870'>9:6 And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what wilt thou have me</a>
<a id='line_871'>to do? And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the city, and it</a>
<a id='line_872'>shall be told thee what thou must do.</a>
<a id='line_873'></a>
<a id='line_874'>9:7 And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a</a>
<a id='line_875'>voice, but seeing no man.</a>
<a id='line_876'></a>
<a id='line_877'>9:8 And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he</a>
<a id='line_878'>saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into</a>
<a id='line_879'>Damascus.</a>
<a id='line_880'></a>
<a id='line_881'>9:9 And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor</a>
<a id='line_882'>drink.</a>
<a id='line_883'></a>
<a id='line_884'>9:10 And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and</a>
<a id='line_885'>to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I am</a>
<a id='line_886'>here, Lord.</a>
<a id='line_887'></a>
<a id='line_888'>9:11 And the Lord said unto him, Arise, and go into the street which</a>
<a id='line_889'>is called Straight, and enquire in the house of Judas for one called</a>
<a id='line_890'>Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth, 9:12 And hath seen in a</a>
<a id='line_891'>vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him,</a>
<a id='line_892'>that he might receive his sight.</a>
<a id='line_893'></a>
<a id='line_894'>9:13 Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man,</a>
<a id='line_895'>how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem: 9:14 And here</a>
<a id='line_896'>he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy</a>
<a id='line_897'>name.</a>
<a id='line_898'></a>
<a id='line_899'>9:15 But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel</a>
<a id='line_900'>unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the</a>
<a id='line_901'>children of Israel: 9:16 For I will shew him how great things he must</a>
<a id='line_902'>suffer for my nameâ€™s sake.</a>
<a id='line_903'></a>
<a id='line_904'>9:17 And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting</a>
<a id='line_905'>his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that</a>
<a id='line_906'>appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou</a>
<a id='line_907'>mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_908'></a>
<a id='line_909'>9:18 And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales:</a>
<a id='line_910'>and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.</a>
<a id='line_911'></a>
<a id='line_912'>9:19 And when he had received meat, he was strengthened. Then was Saul</a>
<a id='line_913'>certain days with the disciples which were at Damascus.</a>
<a id='line_914'></a>
<a id='line_915'>9:20 And straightway he preached Christ in the synagogues, that he is</a>
<a id='line_916'>the Son of God.</a>
<a id='line_917'></a>
<a id='line_918'>9:21 But all that heard him were amazed, and said; Is not this he that</a>
<a id='line_919'>destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither</a>
<a id='line_920'>for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief</a>
<a id='line_921'>priests?  9:22 But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded</a>
<a id='line_922'>the Jews which dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is very Christ.</a>
<a id='line_923'></a>
<a id='line_924'>9:23 And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to</a>
<a id='line_925'>kill him: 9:24 But their laying await was known of Saul. And they</a>
<a id='line_926'>watched the gates day and night to kill him.</a>
<a id='line_927'></a>
<a id='line_928'>9:25 Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the</a>
<a id='line_929'>wall in a basket.</a>
<a id='line_930'></a>
<a id='line_931'>9:26 And when Saul was come to Jerusalem, he assayed to join himself</a>
<a id='line_932'>to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not</a>
<a id='line_933'>that he was a disciple.</a>
<a id='line_934'></a>
<a id='line_935'>9:27 But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and</a>
<a id='line_936'>declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he</a>
<a id='line_937'>had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the</a>
<a id='line_938'>name of Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_939'></a>
<a id='line_940'>9:28 And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_941'></a>
<a id='line_942'>9:29 And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and disputed</a>
<a id='line_943'>against the Grecians: but they went about to slay him.</a>
<a id='line_944'></a>
<a id='line_945'>9:30 Which when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea,</a>
<a id='line_946'>and sent him forth to Tarsus.</a>
<a id='line_947'></a>
<a id='line_948'>9:31 Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and</a>
<a id='line_949'>Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in</a>
<a id='line_950'>the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.</a>
<a id='line_951'></a>
<a id='line_952'>9:32 And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he</a>
<a id='line_953'>came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda.</a>
<a id='line_954'></a>
<a id='line_955'>9:33 And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, which had kept his</a>
<a id='line_956'>bed eight years, and was sick of the palsy.</a>
<a id='line_957'></a>
<a id='line_958'>9:34 And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ maketh thee whole:</a>
<a id='line_959'>arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.</a>
<a id='line_960'></a>
<a id='line_961'>9:35 And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the</a>
<a id='line_962'>Lord.</a>
<a id='line_963'></a>
<a id='line_964'>9:36 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by</a>
<a id='line_965'>interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and</a>
<a id='line_966'>almsdeeds which she did.</a>
<a id='line_967'></a>
<a id='line_968'>9:37 And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died:</a>
<a id='line_969'>whom when they had washed, they laid her in an upper chamber.</a>
<a id='line_970'></a>
<a id='line_971'>9:38 And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the disciples had</a>
<a id='line_972'>heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring him</a>
<a id='line_973'>that he would not delay to come to them.</a>
<a id='line_974'></a>
<a id='line_975'>9:39 Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they</a>
<a id='line_976'>brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him</a>
<a id='line_977'>weeping, and shewing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while</a>
<a id='line_978'>she was with them.</a>
<a id='line_979'></a>
<a id='line_980'>9:40 But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and</a>
<a id='line_981'>turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes:</a>
<a id='line_982'>and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</a>
<a id='line_983'></a>
<a id='line_984'>9:41 And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had</a>
<a id='line_985'>called the saints and widows, presented her alive.</a>
<a id='line_986'></a>
<a id='line_987'>9:42 And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the</a>
<a id='line_988'>Lord.</a>
<a id='line_989'></a>
<a id='line_990'>9:43 And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one</a>
<a id='line_991'>Simon a tanner.</a>
<a id='line_992'></a>
<a id='line_993'>10:1 There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion</a>
<a id='line_994'>of the band called the Italian band, 10:2 A devout man, and one that</a>
<a id='line_995'>feared God with all his house, which gave much alms to the people, and</a>
<a id='line_996'>prayed to God alway.</a>
<a id='line_997'></a>
<a id='line_998'>10:3 He saw in a vision evidently about the ninth hour of the day an</a>
<a id='line_999'>angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.</a>
<a id='line_1000'></a>
<a id='line_1001'>10:4 And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it,</a>
<a id='line_1002'>Lord?  And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are come up</a>
<a id='line_1003'>for a memorial before God.</a>
<a id='line_1004'></a>
<a id='line_1005'>10:5 And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname</a>
<a id='line_1006'>is Peter: 10:6 He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by</a>
<a id='line_1007'>the sea side: he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do.</a>
<a id='line_1008'></a>
<a id='line_1009'>10:7 And when the angel which spake unto Cornelius was departed, he</a>
<a id='line_1010'>called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them</a>
<a id='line_1011'>that waited on him continually; 10:8 And when he had declared all</a>
<a id='line_1012'>these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.</a>
<a id='line_1013'></a>
<a id='line_1014'>10:9 On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto</a>
<a id='line_1015'>the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth</a>
<a id='line_1016'>hour: 10:10 And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while</a>
<a id='line_1017'>they made ready, he fell into a trance, 10:11 And saw heaven opened,</a>
<a id='line_1018'>and a certain vessel descending upon him, as it had been a great sheet</a>
<a id='line_1019'>knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth: 10:12 Wherein</a>
<a id='line_1020'>were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts,</a>
<a id='line_1021'>and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</a>
<a id='line_1022'></a>
<a id='line_1023'>10:13 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.</a>
<a id='line_1024'></a>
<a id='line_1025'>10:14 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing</a>
<a id='line_1026'>that is common or unclean.</a>
<a id='line_1027'></a>
<a id='line_1028'>10:15 And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God</a>
<a id='line_1029'>hath cleansed, that call not thou common.</a>
<a id='line_1030'></a>
<a id='line_1031'>10:16 This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into</a>
<a id='line_1032'>heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1033'></a>
<a id='line_1034'>10:17 Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had</a>
<a id='line_1035'>seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had</a>
<a id='line_1036'>made enquiry for Simonâ€™s house, and stood before the gate, 10:18 And</a>
<a id='line_1037'>called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged</a>
<a id='line_1038'>there.</a>
<a id='line_1039'></a>
<a id='line_1040'>10:19 While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him,</a>
<a id='line_1041'>Behold, three men seek thee.</a>
<a id='line_1042'></a>
<a id='line_1043'>10:20 Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting</a>
<a id='line_1044'>nothing: for I have sent them.</a>
<a id='line_1045'></a>
<a id='line_1046'>10:21 Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from</a>
<a id='line_1047'>Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause</a>
<a id='line_1048'>wherefore ye are come?  10:22 And they said, Cornelius the centurion,</a>
<a id='line_1049'>a just man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the</a>
<a id='line_1050'>nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for</a>
<a id='line_1051'>thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.</a>
<a id='line_1052'></a>
<a id='line_1053'>10:23 Then called he them in, and lodged them. And on the morrow Peter</a>
<a id='line_1054'>went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.</a>
<a id='line_1055'></a>
<a id='line_1056'>10:24 And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius</a>
<a id='line_1057'>waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and near</a>
<a id='line_1058'>friends.</a>
<a id='line_1059'></a>
<a id='line_1060'>10:25 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at</a>
<a id='line_1061'>his feet, and worshipped him.</a>
<a id='line_1062'></a>
<a id='line_1063'>10:26 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.</a>
<a id='line_1064'></a>
<a id='line_1065'>10:27 And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were</a>
<a id='line_1066'>come together.</a>
<a id='line_1067'></a>
<a id='line_1068'>10:28 And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing</a>
<a id='line_1069'>for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another</a>
<a id='line_1070'>nation; but God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common</a>
<a id='line_1071'>or unclean.</a>
<a id='line_1072'></a>
<a id='line_1073'>10:29 Therefore came I unto you without gainsaying, as soon as I was</a>
<a id='line_1074'>sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?  10:30</a>
<a id='line_1075'>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and</a>
<a id='line_1076'>at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood</a>
<a id='line_1077'>before me in bright clothing, 10:31 And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is</a>
<a id='line_1078'>heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.</a>
<a id='line_1079'></a>
<a id='line_1080'>10:32 Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is</a>
<a id='line_1081'>Peter; he is lodged in the house of one Simon a tanner by the sea</a>
<a id='line_1082'>side: who, when he cometh, shall speak unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_1083'></a>
<a id='line_1084'>10:33 Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done</a>
<a id='line_1085'>that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God,</a>
<a id='line_1086'>to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</a>
<a id='line_1087'></a>
<a id='line_1088'>10:34 Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive</a>
<a id='line_1089'>that God is no respecter of persons: 10:35 But in every nation he that</a>
<a id='line_1090'>feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</a>
<a id='line_1091'></a>
<a id='line_1092'>10:36 The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching</a>
<a id='line_1093'>peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:) 10:37 That word, I say, ye</a>
<a id='line_1094'>know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from</a>
<a id='line_1095'>Galilee, after the baptism which John preached; 10:38 How God anointed</a>
<a id='line_1096'>Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about</a>
<a id='line_1097'>doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God</a>
<a id='line_1098'>was with him.</a>
<a id='line_1099'></a>
<a id='line_1100'>10:39 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land</a>
<a id='line_1101'>of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:</a>
<a id='line_1102'>10:40 Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly; 10:41</a>
<a id='line_1103'>Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before God, even to</a>
<a id='line_1104'>us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.</a>
<a id='line_1105'></a>
<a id='line_1106'>10:42 And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify</a>
<a id='line_1107'>that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and</a>
<a id='line_1108'>dead.</a>
<a id='line_1109'></a>
<a id='line_1110'>10:43 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name</a>
<a id='line_1111'>whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.</a>
<a id='line_1112'></a>
<a id='line_1113'>10:44 While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all</a>
<a id='line_1114'>them which heard the word.</a>
<a id='line_1115'></a>
<a id='line_1116'>10:45 And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as</a>
<a id='line_1117'>many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured</a>
<a id='line_1118'>out the gift of the Holy Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_1119'></a>
<a id='line_1120'>10:46 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then</a>
<a id='line_1121'>answered Peter, 10:47 Can any man forbid water, that these should not</a>
<a id='line_1122'>be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?  10:48</a>
<a id='line_1123'>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then</a>
<a id='line_1124'>prayed they him to tarry certain days.</a>
<a id='line_1125'></a>
<a id='line_1126'>11:1 And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the</a>
<a id='line_1127'>Gentiles had also received the word of God.</a>
<a id='line_1128'></a>
<a id='line_1129'>11:2 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the</a>
<a id='line_1130'>circumcision contended with him, 11:3 Saying, Thou wentest in to men</a>
<a id='line_1131'>uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.</a>
<a id='line_1132'></a>
<a id='line_1133'>11:4 But Peter rehearsed the matter from the beginning, and expounded</a>
<a id='line_1134'>it by order unto them, saying, 11:5 I was in the city of Joppa</a>
<a id='line_1135'>praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, A certain vessel descend, as</a>
<a id='line_1136'>it had been a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and</a>
<a id='line_1137'>it came even to me: 11:6 Upon the which when I had fastened mine eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1138'>I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts,</a>
<a id='line_1139'>and creeping things, and fowls of the air.</a>
<a id='line_1140'></a>
<a id='line_1141'>11:7 And I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.</a>
<a id='line_1142'></a>
<a id='line_1143'>11:8 But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at</a>
<a id='line_1144'>any time entered into my mouth.</a>
<a id='line_1145'></a>
<a id='line_1146'>11:9 But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath</a>
<a id='line_1147'>cleansed, that call not thou common.</a>
<a id='line_1148'></a>
<a id='line_1149'>11:10 And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into</a>
<a id='line_1150'>heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1151'></a>
<a id='line_1152'>11:11 And, behold, immediately there were three men already come unto</a>
<a id='line_1153'>the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.</a>
<a id='line_1154'></a>
<a id='line_1155'>11:12 And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover</a>
<a id='line_1156'>these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the manâ€™s</a>
<a id='line_1157'>house: 11:13 And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house,</a>
<a id='line_1158'>which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon,</a>
<a id='line_1159'>whose surname is Peter; 11:14 Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou</a>
<a id='line_1160'>and all thy house shall be saved.</a>
<a id='line_1161'></a>
<a id='line_1162'>11:15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us</a>
<a id='line_1163'>at the beginning.</a>
<a id='line_1164'></a>
<a id='line_1165'>11:16 Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John</a>
<a id='line_1166'>indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy</a>
<a id='line_1167'>Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_1168'></a>
<a id='line_1169'>11:17 Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as he did unto us,</a>
<a id='line_1170'>who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could</a>
<a id='line_1171'>withstand God?  11:18 When they heard these things, they held their</a>
<a id='line_1172'>peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles</a>
<a id='line_1173'>granted repentance unto life.</a>
<a id='line_1174'></a>
<a id='line_1175'>11:19 Now they which were scattered abroad upon the persecution that</a>
<a id='line_1176'>arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and</a>
<a id='line_1177'>Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.</a>
<a id='line_1178'></a>
<a id='line_1179'>11:20 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they</a>
<a id='line_1180'>were come to Antioch, spake unto the Grecians, preaching the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1181'>Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_1182'></a>
<a id='line_1183'>11:21 And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number</a>
<a id='line_1184'>believed, and turned unto the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_1185'></a>
<a id='line_1186'>11:22 Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church</a>
<a id='line_1187'>which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should</a>
<a id='line_1188'>go as far as Antioch.</a>
<a id='line_1189'></a>
<a id='line_1190'>11:23 Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and</a>
<a id='line_1191'>exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto</a>
<a id='line_1192'>the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_1193'></a>
<a id='line_1194'>11:24 For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith:</a>
<a id='line_1195'>and much people was added unto the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_1196'></a>
<a id='line_1197'>11:25 Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: 11:26 And</a>
<a id='line_1198'>when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to</a>
<a id='line_1199'>pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and</a>
<a id='line_1200'>taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in</a>
<a id='line_1201'>Antioch.</a>
<a id='line_1202'></a>
<a id='line_1203'>11:27 And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.</a>
<a id='line_1204'></a>
<a id='line_1205'>11:28 And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by</a>
<a id='line_1206'>the Spirit that there should be great dearth throughout all the world:</a>
<a id='line_1207'>which came to pass in the days of Claudius Caesar.</a>
<a id='line_1208'></a>
<a id='line_1209'>11:29 Then the disciples, every man according to his ability,</a>
<a id='line_1210'>determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judaea:</a>
<a id='line_1211'>11:30 Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of</a>
<a id='line_1212'>Barnabas and Saul.</a>
<a id='line_1213'></a>
<a id='line_1214'>12:1 Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to</a>
<a id='line_1215'>vex certain of the church.</a>
<a id='line_1216'></a>
<a id='line_1217'>12:2 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.</a>
<a id='line_1218'></a>
<a id='line_1219'>12:3 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to</a>
<a id='line_1220'>take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)  12:4 And</a>
<a id='line_1221'>when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him</a>
<a id='line_1222'>to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to</a>
<a id='line_1223'>bring him forth to the people.</a>
<a id='line_1224'></a>
<a id='line_1225'>12:5 Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without</a>
<a id='line_1226'>ceasing of the church unto God for him.</a>
<a id='line_1227'></a>
<a id='line_1228'>12:6 And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter</a>
<a id='line_1229'>was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the</a>
<a id='line_1230'>keepers before the door kept the prison.</a>
<a id='line_1231'></a>
<a id='line_1232'>12:7 And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light</a>
<a id='line_1233'>shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him</a>
<a id='line_1234'>up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.</a>
<a id='line_1235'></a>
<a id='line_1236'>12:8 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy</a>
<a id='line_1237'>sandals.</a>
<a id='line_1238'></a>
<a id='line_1239'>And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and</a>
<a id='line_1240'>follow me.</a>
<a id='line_1241'></a>
<a id='line_1242'>12:9 And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true</a>
<a id='line_1243'>which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.</a>
<a id='line_1244'></a>
<a id='line_1245'>12:10 When they were past the first and the second ward, they came</a>
<a id='line_1246'>unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of</a>
<a id='line_1247'>his own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street;</a>
<a id='line_1248'>and forthwith the angel departed from him.</a>
<a id='line_1249'></a>
<a id='line_1250'>12:11 And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a</a>
<a id='line_1251'>surety, that the LORD hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out</a>
<a id='line_1252'>of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of</a>
<a id='line_1253'>the Jews.</a>
<a id='line_1254'></a>
<a id='line_1255'>12:12 And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of</a>
<a id='line_1256'>Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were</a>
<a id='line_1257'>gathered together praying.</a>
<a id='line_1258'></a>
<a id='line_1259'>12:13 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to</a>
<a id='line_1260'>hearken, named Rhoda.</a>
<a id='line_1261'></a>
<a id='line_1262'>12:14 And when she knew Peterâ€™s voice, she opened not the gate for</a>
<a id='line_1263'>gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.</a>
<a id='line_1264'></a>
<a id='line_1265'>12:15 And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly</a>
<a id='line_1266'>affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.</a>
<a id='line_1267'></a>
<a id='line_1268'>12:16 But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door,</a>
<a id='line_1269'>and saw him, they were astonished.</a>
<a id='line_1270'></a>
<a id='line_1271'>12:17 But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace,</a>
<a id='line_1272'>declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And</a>
<a id='line_1273'>he said, Go shew these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he</a>
<a id='line_1274'>departed, and went into another place.</a>
<a id='line_1275'></a>
<a id='line_1276'>12:18 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the</a>
<a id='line_1277'>soldiers, what was become of Peter.</a>
<a id='line_1278'></a>
<a id='line_1279'>12:19 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he</a>
<a id='line_1280'>examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death.</a>
<a id='line_1281'>And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and there abode.</a>
<a id='line_1282'></a>
<a id='line_1283'>12:20 And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but</a>
<a id='line_1284'>they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the kingâ€™s</a>
<a id='line_1285'>chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was</a>
<a id='line_1286'>nourished by the kingâ€™s country.</a>
<a id='line_1287'></a>
<a id='line_1288'>12:21 And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his</a>
<a id='line_1289'>throne, and made an oration unto them.</a>
<a id='line_1290'></a>
<a id='line_1291'>12:22 And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god,</a>
<a id='line_1292'>and not of a man.</a>
<a id='line_1293'></a>
<a id='line_1294'>12:23 And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave</a>
<a id='line_1295'>not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.</a>
<a id='line_1296'></a>
<a id='line_1297'>12:24 But the word of God grew and multiplied.</a>
<a id='line_1298'></a>
<a id='line_1299'>12:25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had</a>
<a id='line_1300'>fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was</a>
<a id='line_1301'>Mark.</a>
<a id='line_1302'></a>
<a id='line_1303'>13:1 Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets</a>
<a id='line_1304'>and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and</a>
<a id='line_1305'>Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the</a>
<a id='line_1306'>tetrarch, and Saul.</a>
<a id='line_1307'></a>
<a id='line_1308'>13:2 As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said,</a>
<a id='line_1309'>Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called</a>
<a id='line_1310'>them.</a>
<a id='line_1311'></a>
<a id='line_1312'>13:3 And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on</a>
<a id='line_1313'>them, they sent them away.</a>
<a id='line_1314'></a>
<a id='line_1315'>13:4 So they, being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, departed unto</a>
<a id='line_1316'>Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.</a>
<a id='line_1317'></a>
<a id='line_1318'>13:5 And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in</a>
<a id='line_1319'>the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John to their minister.</a>
<a id='line_1320'></a>
<a id='line_1321'>13:6 And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a</a>
<a id='line_1322'>certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:</a>
<a id='line_1323'>13:7 Which was with the deputy of the country, Sergius Paulus, a</a>
<a id='line_1324'>prudent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the</a>
<a id='line_1325'>word of God.</a>
<a id='line_1326'></a>
<a id='line_1327'>13:8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation)</a>
<a id='line_1328'>withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.</a>
<a id='line_1329'></a>
<a id='line_1330'>13:9 Then Saul, (who also is called Paul,) filled with the Holy Ghost,</a>
<a id='line_1331'>set his eyes on him.</a>
<a id='line_1332'></a>
<a id='line_1333'>13:10 And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, thou child of</a>
<a id='line_1334'>the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to</a>
<a id='line_1335'>pervert the right ways of the Lord?  13:11 And now, behold, the hand</a>
<a id='line_1336'>of the Lord is upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun</a>
<a id='line_1337'>for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness;</a>
<a id='line_1338'>and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.</a>
<a id='line_1339'></a>
<a id='line_1340'>13:12 Then the deputy, when he saw what was done, believed, being</a>
<a id='line_1341'>astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_1342'></a>
<a id='line_1343'>13:13 Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to</a>
<a id='line_1344'>Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to</a>
<a id='line_1345'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1346'></a>
<a id='line_1347'>13:14 But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in</a>
<a id='line_1348'>Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.</a>
<a id='line_1349'></a>
<a id='line_1350'>13:15 And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of</a>
<a id='line_1351'>the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if ye have</a>
<a id='line_1352'>any word of exhortation for the people, say on.</a>
<a id='line_1353'></a>
<a id='line_1354'>13:16 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of</a>
<a id='line_1355'>Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.</a>
<a id='line_1356'></a>
<a id='line_1357'>13:17 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted</a>
<a id='line_1358'>the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with</a>
<a id='line_1359'>an high arm brought he them out of it.</a>
<a id='line_1360'></a>
<a id='line_1361'>13:18 And about the time of forty years suffered he their manners in</a>
<a id='line_1362'>the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_1363'></a>
<a id='line_1364'>13:19 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Chanaan,</a>
<a id='line_1365'>he divided their land to them by lot.</a>
<a id='line_1366'></a>
<a id='line_1367'>13:20 And after that he gave unto them judges about the space of four</a>
<a id='line_1368'>hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.</a>
<a id='line_1369'></a>
<a id='line_1370'>13:21 And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul</a>
<a id='line_1371'>the son of Cis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, by the space of forty</a>
<a id='line_1372'>years.</a>
<a id='line_1373'></a>
<a id='line_1374'>13:22 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be</a>
<a id='line_1375'>their king; to whom also he gave their testimony, and said, I have</a>
<a id='line_1376'>found David the son of Jesse, a man after mine own heart, which shall</a>
<a id='line_1377'>fulfil all my will.</a>
<a id='line_1378'></a>
<a id='line_1379'>13:23 Of this manâ€™s seed hath God according to his promise raised unto</a>
<a id='line_1380'>Israel a Saviour, Jesus: 13:24 When John had first preached before his</a>
<a id='line_1381'>coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1382'></a>
<a id='line_1383'>13:25 And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I</a>
<a id='line_1384'>am?  I am not he. But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes</a>
<a id='line_1385'>of his feet I am not worthy to loose.</a>
<a id='line_1386'></a>
<a id='line_1387'>13:26 Men and brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and</a>
<a id='line_1388'>whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation</a>
<a id='line_1389'>sent.</a>
<a id='line_1390'></a>
<a id='line_1391'>13:27 For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they</a>
<a id='line_1392'>knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every</a>
<a id='line_1393'>sabbath day, they have fulfilled them in condemning him.</a>
<a id='line_1394'></a>
<a id='line_1395'>13:28 And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they</a>
<a id='line_1396'>Pilate that he should be slain.</a>
<a id='line_1397'></a>
<a id='line_1398'>13:29 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they</a>
<a id='line_1399'>took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulchre.</a>
<a id='line_1400'></a>
<a id='line_1401'>13:30 But God raised him from the dead: 13:31 And he was seen many</a>
<a id='line_1402'>days of them which came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are</a>
<a id='line_1403'>his witnesses unto the people.</a>
<a id='line_1404'></a>
<a id='line_1405'>13:32 And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which</a>
<a id='line_1406'>was made unto the fathers, 13:33 God hath fulfilled the same unto us</a>
<a id='line_1407'>their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also</a>
<a id='line_1408'>written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten</a>
<a id='line_1409'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_1410'></a>
<a id='line_1411'>13:34 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no</a>
<a id='line_1412'>more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you</a>
<a id='line_1413'>the sure mercies of David.</a>
<a id='line_1414'></a>
<a id='line_1415'>13:35 Wherefore he saith also in another psalm, Thou shalt not suffer</a>
<a id='line_1416'>thine Holy One to see corruption.</a>
<a id='line_1417'></a>
<a id='line_1418'>13:36 For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of</a>
<a id='line_1419'>God, fell on sleep, and was laid unto his fathers, and saw corruption:</a>
<a id='line_1420'>13:37 But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.</a>
<a id='line_1421'></a>
<a id='line_1422'>13:38 Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through</a>
<a id='line_1423'>this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: 13:39 And by</a>
<a id='line_1424'>him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye</a>
<a id='line_1425'>could not be justified by the law of Moses.</a>
<a id='line_1426'></a>
<a id='line_1427'>13:40 Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in</a>
<a id='line_1428'>the prophets; 13:41 Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for</a>
<a id='line_1429'>I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe,</a>
<a id='line_1430'>though a man declare it unto you.</a>
<a id='line_1431'></a>
<a id='line_1432'>13:42 And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles</a>
<a id='line_1433'>besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.</a>
<a id='line_1434'></a>
<a id='line_1435'>13:43 Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and</a>
<a id='line_1436'>religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to</a>
<a id='line_1437'>them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</a>
<a id='line_1438'></a>
<a id='line_1439'>13:44 And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to</a>
<a id='line_1440'>hear the word of God.</a>
<a id='line_1441'></a>
<a id='line_1442'>13:45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with</a>
<a id='line_1443'>envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul,</a>
<a id='line_1444'>contradicting and blaspheming.</a>
<a id='line_1445'></a>
<a id='line_1446'>13:46 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary</a>
<a id='line_1447'>that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing</a>
<a id='line_1448'>ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life,</a>
<a id='line_1449'>lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</a>
<a id='line_1450'></a>
<a id='line_1451'>13:47 For so hath the Lord commanded us, saying, I have set thee to be</a>
<a id='line_1452'>a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the</a>
<a id='line_1453'>ends of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_1454'></a>
<a id='line_1455'>13:48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified</a>
<a id='line_1456'>the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life</a>
<a id='line_1457'>believed.</a>
<a id='line_1458'></a>
<a id='line_1459'>13:49 And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the</a>
<a id='line_1460'>region.</a>
<a id='line_1461'></a>
<a id='line_1462'>13:50 But the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the</a>
<a id='line_1463'>chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and</a>
<a id='line_1464'>Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts.</a>
<a id='line_1465'></a>
<a id='line_1466'>13:51 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came</a>
<a id='line_1467'>unto Iconium.</a>
<a id='line_1468'></a>
<a id='line_1469'>13:52 And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_1470'></a>
<a id='line_1471'>14:1 And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into</a>
<a id='line_1472'>the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both</a>
<a id='line_1473'>of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.</a>
<a id='line_1474'></a>
<a id='line_1475'>14:2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their</a>
<a id='line_1476'>minds evil affected against the brethren.</a>
<a id='line_1477'></a>
<a id='line_1478'>14:3 Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which</a>
<a id='line_1479'>gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and</a>
<a id='line_1480'>wonders to be done by their hands.</a>
<a id='line_1481'></a>
<a id='line_1482'>14:4 But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the</a>
<a id='line_1483'>Jews, and part with the apostles.</a>
<a id='line_1484'></a>
<a id='line_1485'>14:5 And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also</a>
<a id='line_1486'>of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone</a>
<a id='line_1487'>them, 14:6 They were ware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe,</a>
<a id='line_1488'>cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about: 14:7</a>
<a id='line_1489'>And there they preached the gospel.</a>
<a id='line_1490'></a>
<a id='line_1491'>14:8 And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet,</a>
<a id='line_1492'>being a cripple from his motherâ€™s womb, who never had walked: 14:9 The</a>
<a id='line_1493'>same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving</a>
<a id='line_1494'>that he had faith to be healed, 14:10 Said with a loud voice, Stand</a>
<a id='line_1495'>upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.</a>
<a id='line_1496'></a>
<a id='line_1497'>14:11 And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their</a>
<a id='line_1498'>voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us</a>
<a id='line_1499'>in the likeness of men.</a>
<a id='line_1500'></a>
<a id='line_1501'>14:12 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because</a>
<a id='line_1502'>he was the chief speaker.</a>
<a id='line_1503'></a>
<a id='line_1504'>14:13 Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought</a>
<a id='line_1505'>oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with</a>
<a id='line_1506'>the people.</a>
<a id='line_1507'></a>
<a id='line_1508'>14:14 Which when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent</a>
<a id='line_1509'>their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, 14:15 And</a>
<a id='line_1510'>saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions</a>
<a id='line_1511'>with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities</a>
<a id='line_1512'>unto the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and</a>
<a id='line_1513'>all things that are therein: 14:16 Who in times past suffered all</a>
<a id='line_1514'>nations to walk in their own ways.</a>
<a id='line_1515'></a>
<a id='line_1516'>14:17 Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did</a>
<a id='line_1517'>good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our</a>
<a id='line_1518'>hearts with food and gladness.</a>
<a id='line_1519'></a>
<a id='line_1520'>14:18 And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, that</a>
<a id='line_1521'>they had not done sacrifice unto them.</a>
<a id='line_1522'></a>
<a id='line_1523'>14:19 And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium,</a>
<a id='line_1524'>who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the</a>
<a id='line_1525'>city, supposing he had been dead.</a>
<a id='line_1526'></a>
<a id='line_1527'>14:20 Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and</a>
<a id='line_1528'>came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to</a>
<a id='line_1529'>Derbe.</a>
<a id='line_1530'></a>
<a id='line_1531'>14:21 And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had</a>
<a id='line_1532'>taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and</a>
<a id='line_1533'>Antioch, 14:22 Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting</a>
<a id='line_1534'>them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much</a>
<a id='line_1535'>tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.</a>
<a id='line_1536'></a>
<a id='line_1537'>14:23 And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had</a>
<a id='line_1538'>prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they</a>
<a id='line_1539'>believed.</a>
<a id='line_1540'></a>
<a id='line_1541'>14:24 And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to</a>
<a id='line_1542'>Pamphylia.</a>
<a id='line_1543'></a>
<a id='line_1544'>14:25 And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down</a>
<a id='line_1545'>into Attalia: 14:26 And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had</a>
<a id='line_1546'>been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they</a>
<a id='line_1547'>fulfilled.</a>
<a id='line_1548'></a>
<a id='line_1549'>14:27 And when they were come, and had gathered the church together,</a>
<a id='line_1550'>they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened</a>
<a id='line_1551'>the door of faith unto the Gentiles.</a>
<a id='line_1552'></a>
<a id='line_1553'>14:28 And there they abode long time with the disciples.</a>
<a id='line_1554'></a>
<a id='line_1555'>15:1 And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brethren,</a>
<a id='line_1556'>and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye</a>
<a id='line_1557'>cannot be saved.</a>
<a id='line_1558'></a>
<a id='line_1559'>15:2 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and</a>
<a id='line_1560'>disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and</a>
<a id='line_1561'>certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and</a>
<a id='line_1562'>elders about this question.</a>
<a id='line_1563'></a>
<a id='line_1564'>15:3 And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through</a>
<a id='line_1565'>Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and</a>
<a id='line_1566'>they caused great joy unto all the brethren.</a>
<a id='line_1567'></a>
<a id='line_1568'>15:4 And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received of the</a>
<a id='line_1569'>church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things</a>
<a id='line_1570'>that God had done with them.</a>
<a id='line_1571'></a>
<a id='line_1572'>15:5 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which</a>
<a id='line_1573'>believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to</a>
<a id='line_1574'>command them to keep the law of Moses.</a>
<a id='line_1575'></a>
<a id='line_1576'>15:6 And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this</a>
<a id='line_1577'>matter.</a>
<a id='line_1578'></a>
<a id='line_1579'>15:7 And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said</a>
<a id='line_1580'>unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God</a>
<a id='line_1581'>made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the</a>
<a id='line_1582'>word of the gospel, and believe.</a>
<a id='line_1583'></a>
<a id='line_1584'>15:8 And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them</a>
<a id='line_1585'>the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; 15:9 And put no difference</a>
<a id='line_1586'>between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</a>
<a id='line_1587'></a>
<a id='line_1588'>15:10 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of</a>
<a id='line_1589'>the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</a>
<a id='line_1590'>15:11 But we believe that through the grace of the LORD Jesus Christ</a>
<a id='line_1591'>we shall be saved, even as they.</a>
<a id='line_1592'></a>
<a id='line_1593'>15:12 Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to</a>
<a id='line_1594'>Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought</a>
<a id='line_1595'>among the Gentiles by them.</a>
<a id='line_1596'></a>
<a id='line_1597'>15:13 And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men</a>
<a id='line_1598'>and brethren, hearken unto me: 15:14 Simeon hath declared how God at</a>
<a id='line_1599'>the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his</a>
<a id='line_1600'>name.</a>
<a id='line_1601'></a>
<a id='line_1602'>15:15 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,</a>
<a id='line_1603'>15:16 After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of</a>
<a id='line_1604'>David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof,</a>
<a id='line_1605'>and I will set it up: 15:17 That the residue of men might seek after</a>
<a id='line_1606'>the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the</a>
<a id='line_1607'>Lord, who doeth all these things.</a>
<a id='line_1608'></a>
<a id='line_1609'>15:18 Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the</a>
<a id='line_1610'>world.</a>
<a id='line_1611'></a>
<a id='line_1612'>15:19 Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from</a>
<a id='line_1613'>among the Gentiles are turned to God: 15:20 But that we write unto</a>
<a id='line_1614'>them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from</a>
<a id='line_1615'>fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood.</a>
<a id='line_1616'></a>
<a id='line_1617'>15:21 For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him,</a>
<a id='line_1618'>being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.</a>
<a id='line_1619'></a>
<a id='line_1620'>15:22 Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church,</a>
<a id='line_1621'>to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and</a>
<a id='line_1622'>Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among</a>
<a id='line_1623'>the brethren: 15:23 And they wrote letters by them after this manner;</a>
<a id='line_1624'>The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren</a>
<a id='line_1625'>which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.</a>
<a id='line_1626'></a>
<a id='line_1627'>15:24 Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us</a>
<a id='line_1628'>have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must</a>
<a id='line_1629'>be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:</a>
<a id='line_1630'>15:25 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send</a>
<a id='line_1631'>chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, 15:26 Men that</a>
<a id='line_1632'>have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1633'></a>
<a id='line_1634'>15:27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell you</a>
<a id='line_1635'>the same things by mouth.</a>
<a id='line_1636'></a>
<a id='line_1637'>15:28 For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you</a>
<a id='line_1638'>no greater burden than these necessary things; 15:29 That ye abstain</a>
<a id='line_1639'>from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things</a>
<a id='line_1640'>strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye</a>
<a id='line_1641'>shall do well. Fare ye well.</a>
<a id='line_1642'></a>
<a id='line_1643'>15:30 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they</a>
<a id='line_1644'>had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: 15:31</a>
<a id='line_1645'>Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.</a>
<a id='line_1646'></a>
<a id='line_1647'>15:32 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted</a>
<a id='line_1648'>the brethren with many words, and confirmed them.</a>
<a id='line_1649'></a>
<a id='line_1650'>15:33 And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in</a>
<a id='line_1651'>peace from the brethren unto the apostles.</a>
<a id='line_1652'></a>
<a id='line_1653'>15:34 Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.</a>
<a id='line_1654'></a>
<a id='line_1655'>15:35 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and</a>
<a id='line_1656'>preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.</a>
<a id='line_1657'></a>
<a id='line_1658'>15:36 And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and</a>
<a id='line_1659'>visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of</a>
<a id='line_1660'>the LORD, and see how they do.</a>
<a id='line_1661'></a>
<a id='line_1662'>15:37 And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname</a>
<a id='line_1663'>was Mark.</a>
<a id='line_1664'></a>
<a id='line_1665'>15:38 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed</a>
<a id='line_1666'>from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</a>
<a id='line_1667'></a>
<a id='line_1668'>15:39 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed</a>
<a id='line_1669'>asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto</a>
<a id='line_1670'>Cyprus; 15:40 And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by</a>
<a id='line_1671'>the brethren unto the grace of God.</a>
<a id='line_1672'></a>
<a id='line_1673'>15:41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.</a>
<a id='line_1674'></a>
<a id='line_1675'>16:1 Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple</a>
<a id='line_1676'>was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a</a>
<a id='line_1677'>Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek: 16:2 Which was well</a>
<a id='line_1678'>reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.</a>
<a id='line_1679'></a>
<a id='line_1680'>16:3 Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and</a>
<a id='line_1681'>circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for</a>
<a id='line_1682'>they knew all that his father was a Greek.</a>
<a id='line_1683'></a>
<a id='line_1684'>16:4 And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the</a>
<a id='line_1685'>decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders</a>
<a id='line_1686'>which were at Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1687'></a>
<a id='line_1688'>16:5 And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased</a>
<a id='line_1689'>in number daily.</a>
<a id='line_1690'></a>
<a id='line_1691'>16:6 Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of</a>
<a id='line_1692'>Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in</a>
<a id='line_1693'>Asia, 16:7 After they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into</a>
<a id='line_1694'>Bithynia: but the Spirit suffered them not.</a>
<a id='line_1695'></a>
<a id='line_1696'>16:8 And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.</a>
<a id='line_1697'></a>
<a id='line_1698'>16:9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of</a>
<a id='line_1699'>Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help</a>
<a id='line_1700'>us.</a>
<a id='line_1701'></a>
<a id='line_1702'>16:10 And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to</a>
<a id='line_1703'>go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us for</a>
<a id='line_1704'>to preach the gospel unto them.</a>
<a id='line_1705'></a>
<a id='line_1706'>16:11 Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to</a>
<a id='line_1707'>Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; 16:12 And from thence to</a>
<a id='line_1708'>Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a</a>
<a id='line_1709'>colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.</a>
<a id='line_1710'></a>
<a id='line_1711'>16:13 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side,</a>
<a id='line_1712'>where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the</a>
<a id='line_1713'>women which resorted thither.</a>
<a id='line_1714'></a>
<a id='line_1715'>16:14 And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city</a>
<a id='line_1716'>of Thyatira, which worshipped God, heard us: whose heart the Lord</a>
<a id='line_1717'>opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul.</a>
<a id='line_1718'></a>
<a id='line_1719'>16:15 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought us,</a>
<a id='line_1720'>saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my</a>
<a id='line_1721'>house, and abide there. And she constrained us.</a>
<a id='line_1722'></a>
<a id='line_1723'>16:16 And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel</a>
<a id='line_1724'>possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her</a>
<a id='line_1725'>masters much gain by soothsaying: 16:17 The same followed Paul and us,</a>
<a id='line_1726'>and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God,</a>
<a id='line_1727'>which shew unto us the way of salvation.</a>
<a id='line_1728'></a>
<a id='line_1729'>16:18 And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and</a>
<a id='line_1730'>said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come</a>
<a id='line_1731'>out of her.</a>
<a id='line_1732'></a>
<a id='line_1733'>And he came out the same hour.</a>
<a id='line_1734'></a>
<a id='line_1735'>16:19 And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone,</a>
<a id='line_1736'>they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace unto</a>
<a id='line_1737'>the rulers, 16:20 And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These</a>
<a id='line_1738'>men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city, 16:21 And teach</a>
<a id='line_1739'>customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe,</a>
<a id='line_1740'>being Romans.</a>
<a id='line_1741'></a>
<a id='line_1742'>16:22 And the multitude rose up together against them: and the</a>
<a id='line_1743'>magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.</a>
<a id='line_1744'></a>
<a id='line_1745'>16:23 And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them</a>
<a id='line_1746'>into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely: 16:24 Who,</a>
<a id='line_1747'>having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and</a>
<a id='line_1748'>made their feet fast in the stocks.</a>
<a id='line_1749'></a>
<a id='line_1750'>16:25 And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto</a>
<a id='line_1751'>God: and the prisoners heard them.</a>
<a id='line_1752'></a>
<a id='line_1753'>16:26 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the</a>
<a id='line_1754'>foundations of the prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors</a>
<a id='line_1755'>were opened, and every oneâ€™s bands were loosed.</a>
<a id='line_1756'></a>
<a id='line_1757'>16:27 And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and</a>
<a id='line_1758'>seeing the prison doors open, he drew out his sword, and would have</a>
<a id='line_1759'>killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had been fled.</a>
<a id='line_1760'></a>
<a id='line_1761'>16:28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm:</a>
<a id='line_1762'>for we are all here.</a>
<a id='line_1763'></a>
<a id='line_1764'>16:29 Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling,</a>
<a id='line_1765'>and fell down before Paul and Silas, 16:30 And brought them out, and</a>
<a id='line_1766'>said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  16:31 And they said, Believe</a>
<a id='line_1767'>on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, and thy house.</a>
<a id='line_1768'></a>
<a id='line_1769'>16:32 And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that</a>
<a id='line_1770'>were in his house.</a>
<a id='line_1771'></a>
<a id='line_1772'>16:33 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their</a>
<a id='line_1773'>stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.</a>
<a id='line_1774'></a>
<a id='line_1775'>16:34 And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before</a>
<a id='line_1776'>them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.</a>
<a id='line_1777'></a>
<a id='line_1778'>16:35 And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1779'>Let those men go.</a>
<a id='line_1780'></a>
<a id='line_1781'>16:36 And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The</a>
<a id='line_1782'>magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in</a>
<a id='line_1783'>peace.</a>
<a id='line_1784'></a>
<a id='line_1785'>16:37 But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned,</a>
<a id='line_1786'>being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us</a>
<a id='line_1787'>out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us</a>
<a id='line_1788'>out.</a>
<a id='line_1789'></a>
<a id='line_1790'>16:38 And the serjeants told these words unto the magistrates: and</a>
<a id='line_1791'>they feared, when they heard that they were Romans.</a>
<a id='line_1792'></a>
<a id='line_1793'>16:39 And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and</a>
<a id='line_1794'>desired them to depart out of the city.</a>
<a id='line_1795'></a>
<a id='line_1796'>16:40 And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of</a>
<a id='line_1797'>Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and</a>
<a id='line_1798'>departed.</a>
<a id='line_1799'></a>
<a id='line_1800'>17:1 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they</a>
<a id='line_1801'>came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews: 17:2 And</a>
<a id='line_1802'>Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days</a>
<a id='line_1803'>reasoned with them out of the scriptures, 17:3 Opening and alleging,</a>
<a id='line_1804'>that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead;</a>
<a id='line_1805'>and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1806'></a>
<a id='line_1807'>17:4 And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and</a>
<a id='line_1808'>of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a</a>
<a id='line_1809'>few.</a>
<a id='line_1810'></a>
<a id='line_1811'>17:5 But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took unto them</a>
<a id='line_1812'>certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and</a>
<a id='line_1813'>set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and</a>
<a id='line_1814'>sought to bring them out to the people.</a>
<a id='line_1815'></a>
<a id='line_1816'>17:6 And when they found them not, they drew Jason and certain</a>
<a id='line_1817'>brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned</a>
<a id='line_1818'>the world upside down are come hither also; 17:7 Whom Jason hath</a>
<a id='line_1819'>received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying</a>
<a id='line_1820'>that there is another king, one Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_1821'></a>
<a id='line_1822'>17:8 And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when</a>
<a id='line_1823'>they heard these things.</a>
<a id='line_1824'></a>
<a id='line_1825'>17:9 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they</a>
<a id='line_1826'>let them go.</a>
<a id='line_1827'></a>
<a id='line_1828'>17:10 And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night</a>
<a id='line_1829'>unto Berea: who coming thither went into the synagogue of the Jews.</a>
<a id='line_1830'></a>
<a id='line_1831'>17:11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they</a>
<a id='line_1832'>received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the</a>
<a id='line_1833'>scriptures daily, whether those things were so.</a>
<a id='line_1834'></a>
<a id='line_1835'>17:12 Therefore many of them believed; also of honourable women which</a>
<a id='line_1836'>were Greeks, and of men, not a few.</a>
<a id='line_1837'></a>
<a id='line_1838'>17:13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of</a>
<a id='line_1839'>God was preached of Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred</a>
<a id='line_1840'>up the people.</a>
<a id='line_1841'></a>
<a id='line_1842'>17:14 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it</a>
<a id='line_1843'>were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still.</a>
<a id='line_1844'></a>
<a id='line_1845'>17:15 And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and</a>
<a id='line_1846'>receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him</a>
<a id='line_1847'>with all speed, they departed.</a>
<a id='line_1848'></a>
<a id='line_1849'>17:16 Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred</a>
<a id='line_1850'>in him, when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry.</a>
<a id='line_1851'></a>
<a id='line_1852'>17:17 Therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the Jews, and with</a>
<a id='line_1853'>the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with</a>
<a id='line_1854'>him.</a>
<a id='line_1855'></a>
<a id='line_1856'>17:18 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks,</a>
<a id='line_1857'>encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? other</a>
<a id='line_1858'>some, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods: because he</a>
<a id='line_1859'>preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.</a>
<a id='line_1860'></a>
<a id='line_1861'>17:19 And they took him, and brought him unto Areopagus, saying, May</a>
<a id='line_1862'>we know what this new doctrine, whereof thou speakest, is?  17:20 For</a>
<a id='line_1863'>thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know</a>
<a id='line_1864'>therefore what these things mean.</a>
<a id='line_1865'></a>
<a id='line_1866'>17:21 (For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent</a>
<a id='line_1867'>their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new</a>
<a id='line_1868'>thing.)  17:22 Then Paul stood in the midst of Marsâ€™ hill, and said,</a>
<a id='line_1869'>Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too</a>
<a id='line_1870'>superstitious.</a>
<a id='line_1871'></a>
<a id='line_1872'>17:23 For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar</a>
<a id='line_1873'>with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye</a>
<a id='line_1874'>ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.</a>
<a id='line_1875'></a>
<a id='line_1876'>17:24 God that made the world and all things therein, seeing that he</a>
<a id='line_1877'>is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;</a>
<a id='line_1878'>17:25 Neither is worshipped with menâ€™s hands, as though he needed any</a>
<a id='line_1879'>thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things; 17:26</a>
<a id='line_1880'>And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the</a>
<a id='line_1881'>face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and</a>
<a id='line_1882'>the bounds of their habitation; 17:27 That they should seek the Lord,</a>
<a id='line_1883'>if haply they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far</a>
<a id='line_1884'>from every one of us: 17:28 For in him we live, and move, and have our</a>
<a id='line_1885'>being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also</a>
<a id='line_1886'>his offspring.</a>
<a id='line_1887'></a>
<a id='line_1888'>17:29 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to</a>
<a id='line_1889'>think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven</a>
<a id='line_1890'>by art and manâ€™s device.</a>
<a id='line_1891'></a>
<a id='line_1892'>17:30 And the times of this ignorance God winked at; but now</a>
<a id='line_1893'>commandeth all men every where to repent: 17:31 Because he hath</a>
<a id='line_1894'>appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in righteousness</a>
<a id='line_1895'>by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given assurance</a>
<a id='line_1896'>unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead.</a>
<a id='line_1897'></a>
<a id='line_1898'>17:32 And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some</a>
<a id='line_1899'>mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this matter.</a>
<a id='line_1900'></a>
<a id='line_1901'>17:33 So Paul departed from among them.</a>
<a id='line_1902'></a>
<a id='line_1903'>17:34 Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed: among the</a>
<a id='line_1904'>which was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and</a>
<a id='line_1905'>others with them.</a>
<a id='line_1906'></a>
<a id='line_1907'>18:1 After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to</a>
<a id='line_1908'>Corinth; 18:2 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus,</a>
<a id='line_1909'>lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that</a>
<a id='line_1910'>Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto</a>
<a id='line_1911'>them.</a>
<a id='line_1912'></a>
<a id='line_1913'>18:3 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and</a>
<a id='line_1914'>wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.</a>
<a id='line_1915'></a>
<a id='line_1916'>18:4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the</a>
<a id='line_1917'>Jews and the Greeks.</a>
<a id='line_1918'></a>
<a id='line_1919'>18:5 And when Silas and Timotheus were come from Macedonia, Paul was</a>
<a id='line_1920'>pressed in the spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was</a>
<a id='line_1921'>Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1922'></a>
<a id='line_1923'>18:6 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook his</a>
<a id='line_1924'>raiment, and said unto them, Your blood be upon your own heads; I am</a>
<a id='line_1925'>clean; from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.</a>
<a id='line_1926'></a>
<a id='line_1927'>18:7 And he departed thence, and entered into a certain manâ€™s house,</a>
<a id='line_1928'>named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the</a>
<a id='line_1929'>synagogue.</a>
<a id='line_1930'></a>
<a id='line_1931'>18:8 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the</a>
<a id='line_1932'>Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed,</a>
<a id='line_1933'>and were baptized.</a>
<a id='line_1934'></a>
<a id='line_1935'>18:9 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not</a>
<a id='line_1936'>afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: 18:10 For I am with thee,</a>
<a id='line_1937'>and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in</a>
<a id='line_1938'>this city.</a>
<a id='line_1939'></a>
<a id='line_1940'>18:11 And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word</a>
<a id='line_1941'>of God among them.</a>
<a id='line_1942'></a>
<a id='line_1943'>18:12 And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made</a>
<a id='line_1944'>insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the</a>
<a id='line_1945'>judgment seat, 18:13 Saying, This fellow persuadeth men to worship God</a>
<a id='line_1946'>contrary to the law.</a>
<a id='line_1947'></a>
<a id='line_1948'>18:14 And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto</a>
<a id='line_1949'>the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O ye Jews,</a>
<a id='line_1950'>reason would that I should bear with you: 18:15 But if it be a</a>
<a id='line_1951'>question of words and names, and of your law, look ye to it; for I</a>
<a id='line_1952'>will be no judge of such matters.</a>
<a id='line_1953'></a>
<a id='line_1954'>18:16 And he drave them from the judgment seat.</a>
<a id='line_1955'></a>
<a id='line_1956'>18:17 Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the</a>
<a id='line_1957'>synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for</a>
<a id='line_1958'>none of those things.</a>
<a id='line_1959'></a>
<a id='line_1960'>18:18 And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then</a>
<a id='line_1961'>took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with</a>
<a id='line_1962'>him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he</a>
<a id='line_1963'>had a vow.</a>
<a id='line_1964'></a>
<a id='line_1965'>18:19 And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself</a>
<a id='line_1966'>entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</a>
<a id='line_1967'></a>
<a id='line_1968'>18:20 When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he</a>
<a id='line_1969'>consented not; 18:21 But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all</a>
<a id='line_1970'>means keep this feast that cometh in Jerusalem: but I will return</a>
<a id='line_1971'>again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.</a>
<a id='line_1972'></a>
<a id='line_1973'>18:22 And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the</a>
<a id='line_1974'>church, he went down to Antioch.</a>
<a id='line_1975'></a>
<a id='line_1976'>18:23 And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went</a>
<a id='line_1977'>over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening</a>
<a id='line_1978'>all the disciples.</a>
<a id='line_1979'></a>
<a id='line_1980'>18:24 And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent</a>
<a id='line_1981'>man, and mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</a>
<a id='line_1982'></a>
<a id='line_1983'>18:25 This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being</a>
<a id='line_1984'>fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of</a>
<a id='line_1985'>the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.</a>
<a id='line_1986'></a>
<a id='line_1987'>18:26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila</a>
<a id='line_1988'>and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto</a>
<a id='line_1989'>him the way of God more perfectly.</a>
<a id='line_1990'></a>
<a id='line_1991'>18:27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren</a>
<a id='line_1992'>wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come,</a>
<a id='line_1993'>helped them much which had believed through grace: 18:28 For he</a>
<a id='line_1994'>mightily convinced the Jews, and that publickly, shewing by the</a>
<a id='line_1995'>scriptures that Jesus was Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1996'></a>
<a id='line_1997'>19:1 And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul</a>
<a id='line_1998'>having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding</a>
<a id='line_1999'>certain disciples, 19:2 He said unto them, Have ye received the Holy</a>
<a id='line_2000'>Ghost since ye believed?  And they said unto him, We have not so much</a>
<a id='line_2001'>as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_2002'></a>
<a id='line_2003'>19:3 And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they</a>
<a id='line_2004'>said, Unto Johnâ€™s baptism.</a>
<a id='line_2005'></a>
<a id='line_2006'>19:4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of</a>
<a id='line_2007'>repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on him</a>
<a id='line_2008'>which should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_2009'></a>
<a id='line_2010'>19:5 When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord</a>
<a id='line_2011'>Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_2012'></a>
<a id='line_2013'>19:6 And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came</a>
<a id='line_2014'>on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.</a>
<a id='line_2015'></a>
<a id='line_2016'>19:7 And all the men were about twelve.</a>
<a id='line_2017'></a>
<a id='line_2018'>19:8 And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of</a>
<a id='line_2019'>three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the</a>
<a id='line_2020'>kingdom of God.</a>
<a id='line_2021'></a>
<a id='line_2022'>19:9 But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil</a>
<a id='line_2023'>of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated</a>
<a id='line_2024'>the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</a>
<a id='line_2025'></a>
<a id='line_2026'>19:10 And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they</a>
<a id='line_2027'>which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and</a>
<a id='line_2028'>Greeks.</a>
<a id='line_2029'></a>
<a id='line_2030'>19:11 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: 19:12 So</a>
<a id='line_2031'>that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons,</a>
<a id='line_2032'>and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of</a>
<a id='line_2033'>them.</a>
<a id='line_2034'></a>
<a id='line_2035'>19:13 Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took upon them to</a>
<a id='line_2036'>call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus,</a>
<a id='line_2037'>saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth.</a>
<a id='line_2038'></a>
<a id='line_2039'>19:14 And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew, and chief of the</a>
<a id='line_2040'>priests, which did so.</a>
<a id='line_2041'></a>
<a id='line_2042'>19:15 And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I</a>
<a id='line_2043'>know; but who are ye?  19:16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was</a>
<a id='line_2044'>leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that</a>
<a id='line_2045'>they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</a>
<a id='line_2046'></a>
<a id='line_2047'>19:17 And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at</a>
<a id='line_2048'>Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was</a>
<a id='line_2049'>magnified.</a>
<a id='line_2050'></a>
<a id='line_2051'>19:18 And many that believed came, and confessed, and shewed their</a>
<a id='line_2052'>deeds.</a>
<a id='line_2053'></a>
<a id='line_2054'>19:19 Many of them also which used curious arts brought their books</a>
<a id='line_2055'>together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price</a>
<a id='line_2056'>of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</a>
<a id='line_2057'></a>
<a id='line_2058'>19:20 So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.</a>
<a id='line_2059'></a>
<a id='line_2060'>19:21 After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when</a>
<a id='line_2061'>he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_2062'>saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.</a>
<a id='line_2063'></a>
<a id='line_2064'>19:22 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him,</a>
<a id='line_2065'>Timotheus and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.</a>
<a id='line_2066'></a>
<a id='line_2067'>19:23 And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.</a>
<a id='line_2068'></a>
<a id='line_2069'>19:24 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made</a>
<a id='line_2070'>silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;</a>
<a id='line_2071'>19:25 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and</a>
<a id='line_2072'>said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.</a>
<a id='line_2073'></a>
<a id='line_2074'>19:26 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost</a>
<a id='line_2075'>throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away much</a>
<a id='line_2076'>people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands: 19:27</a>
<a id='line_2077'>So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at nought; but</a>
<a id='line_2078'>also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised,</a>
<a id='line_2079'>and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world</a>
<a id='line_2080'>worshippeth.</a>
<a id='line_2081'></a>
<a id='line_2082'>19:28 And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath, and</a>
<a id='line_2083'>cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</a>
<a id='line_2084'></a>
<a id='line_2085'>19:29 And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught</a>
<a id='line_2086'>Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paulâ€™s companions in travel,</a>
<a id='line_2087'>they rushed with one accord into the theatre.</a>
<a id='line_2088'></a>
<a id='line_2089'>19:30 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the</a>
<a id='line_2090'>disciples suffered him not.</a>
<a id='line_2091'></a>
<a id='line_2092'>19:31 And certain of the chief of Asia, which were his friends, sent</a>
<a id='line_2093'>unto him, desiring him that he would not adventure himself into the</a>
<a id='line_2094'>theatre.</a>
<a id='line_2095'></a>
<a id='line_2096'>19:32 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another: for the</a>
<a id='line_2097'>assembly was confused: and the more part knew not wherefore they were</a>
<a id='line_2098'>come together.</a>
<a id='line_2099'></a>
<a id='line_2100'>19:33 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting</a>
<a id='line_2101'>him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made</a>
<a id='line_2102'>his defence unto the people.</a>
<a id='line_2103'></a>
<a id='line_2104'>19:34 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about</a>
<a id='line_2105'>the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.</a>
<a id='line_2106'></a>
<a id='line_2107'>19:35 And when the townclerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men</a>
<a id='line_2108'>of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of</a>
<a id='line_2109'>the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the</a>
<a id='line_2110'>image which fell down from Jupiter?  19:36 Seeing then that these</a>
<a id='line_2111'>things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do</a>
<a id='line_2112'>nothing rashly.</a>
<a id='line_2113'></a>
<a id='line_2114'>19:37 For ye have brought hither these men, which are neither robbers</a>
<a id='line_2115'>of churches, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.</a>
<a id='line_2116'></a>
<a id='line_2117'>19:38 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him,</a>
<a id='line_2118'>have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are</a>
<a id='line_2119'>deputies: let them implead one another.</a>
<a id='line_2120'></a>
<a id='line_2121'>19:39 But if ye enquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall</a>
<a id='line_2122'>be determined in a lawful assembly.</a>
<a id='line_2123'></a>
<a id='line_2124'>19:40 For we are in danger to be called in question for this dayâ€™s</a>
<a id='line_2125'>uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this</a>
<a id='line_2126'>concourse.</a>
<a id='line_2127'></a>
<a id='line_2128'>19:41 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.</a>
<a id='line_2129'></a>
<a id='line_2130'>20:1 And after the uproar was ceased, Paul called unto him the</a>
<a id='line_2131'>disciples, and embraced them, and departed for to go into Macedonia.</a>
<a id='line_2132'></a>
<a id='line_2133'>20:2 And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much</a>
<a id='line_2134'>exhortation, he came into Greece, 20:3 And there abode three months.</a>
<a id='line_2135'>And when the Jews laid wait for him, as he was about to sail into</a>
<a id='line_2136'>Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.</a>
<a id='line_2137'></a>
<a id='line_2138'>20:4 And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the</a>
<a id='line_2139'>Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and</a>
<a id='line_2140'>Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.</a>
<a id='line_2141'></a>
<a id='line_2142'>20:5 These going before tarried for us at Troas.</a>
<a id='line_2143'></a>
<a id='line_2144'>20:6 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened</a>
<a id='line_2145'>bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven</a>
<a id='line_2146'>days.</a>
<a id='line_2147'></a>
<a id='line_2148'>20:7 And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came</a>
<a id='line_2149'>together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on</a>
<a id='line_2150'>the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.</a>
<a id='line_2151'></a>
<a id='line_2152'>20:8 And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where they were</a>
<a id='line_2153'>gathered together.</a>
<a id='line_2154'></a>
<a id='line_2155'>20:9 And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus,</a>
<a id='line_2156'>being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he</a>
<a id='line_2157'>sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken</a>
<a id='line_2158'>up dead.</a>
<a id='line_2159'></a>
<a id='line_2160'>20:10 And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing him said,</a>
<a id='line_2161'>Trouble not yourselves; for his life is in him.</a>
<a id='line_2162'></a>
<a id='line_2163'>20:11 When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and</a>
<a id='line_2164'>eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he</a>
<a id='line_2165'>departed.</a>
<a id='line_2166'></a>
<a id='line_2167'>20:12 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little</a>
<a id='line_2168'>comforted.</a>
<a id='line_2169'></a>
<a id='line_2170'>20:13 And we went before to ship, and sailed unto Assos, there</a>
<a id='line_2171'>intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to</a>
<a id='line_2172'>go afoot.</a>
<a id='line_2173'></a>
<a id='line_2174'>20:14 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to</a>
<a id='line_2175'>Mitylene.</a>
<a id='line_2176'></a>
<a id='line_2177'>20:15 And we sailed thence, and came the next day over against Chios;</a>
<a id='line_2178'>and the next day we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and</a>
<a id='line_2179'>the next day we came to Miletus.</a>
<a id='line_2180'></a>
<a id='line_2181'>20:16 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not</a>
<a id='line_2182'>spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to</a>
<a id='line_2183'>be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</a>
<a id='line_2184'></a>
<a id='line_2185'>20:17 And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of</a>
<a id='line_2186'>the church.</a>
<a id='line_2187'></a>
<a id='line_2188'>20:18 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from</a>
<a id='line_2189'>the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been</a>
<a id='line_2190'>with you at all seasons, 20:19 Serving the LORD with all humility of</a>
<a id='line_2191'>mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the</a>
<a id='line_2192'>lying in wait of the Jews: 20:20 And how I kept back nothing that was</a>
<a id='line_2193'>profitable unto you, but have shewed you, and have taught you</a>
<a id='line_2194'>publickly, and from house to house, 20:21 Testifying both to the Jews,</a>
<a id='line_2195'>and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our</a>
<a id='line_2196'>Lord Jesus Christ.</a>
<a id='line_2197'></a>
<a id='line_2198'>20:22 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not</a>
<a id='line_2199'>knowing the things that shall befall me there: 20:23 Save that the</a>
<a id='line_2200'>Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions</a>
<a id='line_2201'>abide me.</a>
<a id='line_2202'></a>
<a id='line_2203'>20:24 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear</a>
<a id='line_2204'>unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the</a>
<a id='line_2205'>ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the</a>
<a id='line_2206'>gospel of the grace of God.</a>
<a id='line_2207'></a>
<a id='line_2208'>20:25 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone</a>
<a id='line_2209'>preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.</a>
<a id='line_2210'></a>
<a id='line_2211'>20:26 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the</a>
<a id='line_2212'>blood of all men.</a>
<a id='line_2213'></a>
<a id='line_2214'>20:27 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of</a>
<a id='line_2215'>God.</a>
<a id='line_2216'></a>
<a id='line_2217'>20:28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over</a>
<a id='line_2218'>the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church</a>
<a id='line_2219'>of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.</a>
<a id='line_2220'></a>
<a id='line_2221'>20:29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves</a>
<a id='line_2222'>enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</a>
<a id='line_2223'></a>
<a id='line_2224'>20:30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse</a>
<a id='line_2225'>things, to draw away disciples after them.</a>
<a id='line_2226'></a>
<a id='line_2227'>20:31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years</a>
<a id='line_2228'>I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.</a>
<a id='line_2229'></a>
<a id='line_2230'>20:32 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his</a>
<a id='line_2231'>grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance</a>
<a id='line_2232'>among all them which are sanctified.</a>
<a id='line_2233'></a>
<a id='line_2234'>20:33 I have coveted no manâ€™s silver, or gold, or apparel.</a>
<a id='line_2235'></a>
<a id='line_2236'>20:34 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto</a>
<a id='line_2237'>my necessities, and to them that were with me.</a>
<a id='line_2238'></a>
<a id='line_2239'>20:35 I have shewed you all things, how that so labouring ye ought to</a>
<a id='line_2240'>support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he</a>
<a id='line_2241'>said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</a>
<a id='line_2242'></a>
<a id='line_2243'>20:36 And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with</a>
<a id='line_2244'>them all.</a>
<a id='line_2245'></a>
<a id='line_2246'>20:37 And they all wept sore, and fell on Paulâ€™s neck, and kissed him,</a>
<a id='line_2247'>20:38 Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they</a>
<a id='line_2248'>should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.</a>
<a id='line_2249'></a>
<a id='line_2250'>21:1 And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had</a>
<a id='line_2251'>launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day</a>
<a id='line_2252'>following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara: 21:2 And finding a</a>
<a id='line_2253'>ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.</a>
<a id='line_2254'></a>
<a id='line_2255'>21:3 Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand,</a>
<a id='line_2256'>and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to</a>
<a id='line_2257'>unlade her burden.</a>
<a id='line_2258'></a>
<a id='line_2259'>21:4 And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to</a>
<a id='line_2260'>Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_2261'></a>
<a id='line_2262'>21:5 And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our</a>
<a id='line_2263'>way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till</a>
<a id='line_2264'>we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.</a>
<a id='line_2265'></a>
<a id='line_2266'>21:6 And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and</a>
<a id='line_2267'>they returned home again.</a>
<a id='line_2268'></a>
<a id='line_2269'>21:7 And when we had finished our course from Tyre, we came to</a>
<a id='line_2270'>Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.</a>
<a id='line_2271'></a>
<a id='line_2272'>21:8 And the next day we that were of Paulâ€™s company departed, and</a>
<a id='line_2273'>came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the</a>
<a id='line_2274'>evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him.</a>
<a id='line_2275'></a>
<a id='line_2276'>21:9 And the same man had four daughters, virgins, which did prophesy.</a>
<a id='line_2277'></a>
<a id='line_2278'>21:10 And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a</a>
<a id='line_2279'>certain prophet, named Agabus.</a>
<a id='line_2280'></a>
<a id='line_2281'>21:11 And when he was come unto us, he took Paulâ€™s girdle, and bound</a>
<a id='line_2282'>his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall</a>
<a id='line_2283'>the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall</a>
<a id='line_2284'>deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.</a>
<a id='line_2285'></a>
<a id='line_2286'>21:12 And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place,</a>
<a id='line_2287'>besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_2288'></a>
<a id='line_2289'>21:13 Then Paul answered, What mean ye to weep and to break mine</a>
<a id='line_2290'>heart?  for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at</a>
<a id='line_2291'>Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_2292'></a>
<a id='line_2293'>21:14 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will</a>
<a id='line_2294'>of the Lord be done.</a>
<a id='line_2295'></a>
<a id='line_2296'>21:15 And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to</a>
<a id='line_2297'>Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_2298'></a>
<a id='line_2299'>21:16 There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea,</a>
<a id='line_2300'>and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom</a>
<a id='line_2301'>we should lodge.</a>
<a id='line_2302'></a>
<a id='line_2303'>21:17 And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us</a>
<a id='line_2304'>gladly.</a>
<a id='line_2305'></a>
<a id='line_2306'>21:18 And the day following Paul went in with us unto James; and all</a>
<a id='line_2307'>the elders were present.</a>
<a id='line_2308'></a>
<a id='line_2309'>21:19 And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what</a>
<a id='line_2310'>things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.</a>
<a id='line_2311'></a>
<a id='line_2312'>21:20 And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_2313'>him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which</a>
<a id='line_2314'>believe; and they are all zealous of the law: 21:21 And they are</a>
<a id='line_2315'>informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the</a>
<a id='line_2316'>Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise</a>
<a id='line_2317'>their children, neither to walk after the customs.</a>
<a id='line_2318'></a>
<a id='line_2319'>21:22 What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together:</a>
<a id='line_2320'>for they will hear that thou art come.</a>
<a id='line_2321'></a>
<a id='line_2322'>21:23 Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men which</a>
<a id='line_2323'>have a vow on them; 21:24 Them take, and purify thyself with them, and</a>
<a id='line_2324'>be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may</a>
<a id='line_2325'>know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee,</a>
<a id='line_2326'>are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest</a>
<a id='line_2327'>the law.</a>
<a id='line_2328'></a>
<a id='line_2329'>21:25 As touching the Gentiles which believe, we have written and</a>
<a id='line_2330'>concluded that they observe no such thing, save only that they keep</a>
<a id='line_2331'>themselves from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from</a>
<a id='line_2332'>strangled, and from fornication.</a>
<a id='line_2333'></a>
<a id='line_2334'>21:26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with</a>
<a id='line_2335'>them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the</a>
<a id='line_2336'>days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for</a>
<a id='line_2337'>every one of them.</a>
<a id='line_2338'></a>
<a id='line_2339'>21:27 And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were</a>
<a id='line_2340'>of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people,</a>
<a id='line_2341'>and laid hands on him, 21:28 Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is</a>
<a id='line_2342'>the man, that teacheth all men every where against the people, and the</a>
<a id='line_2343'>law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple,</a>
<a id='line_2344'>and hath polluted this holy place.</a>
<a id='line_2345'></a>
<a id='line_2346'>21:29 (For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an</a>
<a id='line_2347'>Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)</a>
<a id='line_2348'>21:30 And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and</a>
<a id='line_2349'>they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple: and forthwith the</a>
<a id='line_2350'>doors were shut.</a>
<a id='line_2351'></a>
<a id='line_2352'>21:31 And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief</a>
<a id='line_2353'>captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</a>
<a id='line_2354'></a>
<a id='line_2355'>21:32 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto</a>
<a id='line_2356'>them: and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left</a>
<a id='line_2357'>beating of Paul.</a>
<a id='line_2358'></a>
<a id='line_2359'>21:33 Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded</a>
<a id='line_2360'>him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he</a>
<a id='line_2361'>had done.</a>
<a id='line_2362'></a>
<a id='line_2363'>21:34 And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude: and</a>
<a id='line_2364'>when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him</a>
<a id='line_2365'>to be carried into the castle.</a>
<a id='line_2366'></a>
<a id='line_2367'>21:35 And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne</a>
<a id='line_2368'>of the soldiers for the violence of the people.</a>
<a id='line_2369'></a>
<a id='line_2370'>21:36 For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away</a>
<a id='line_2371'>with him.</a>
<a id='line_2372'></a>
<a id='line_2373'>21:37 And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the</a>
<a id='line_2374'>chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak</a>
<a id='line_2375'>Greek?  21:38 Art not thou that Egyptian, which before these days</a>
<a id='line_2376'>madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand</a>
<a id='line_2377'>men that were murderers?  21:39 But Paul said, I am a man which am a</a>
<a id='line_2378'>Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I</a>
<a id='line_2379'>beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.</a>
<a id='line_2380'></a>
<a id='line_2381'>21:40 And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and</a>
<a id='line_2382'>beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a</a>
<a id='line_2383'>great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew tongue, saying, 22:1</a>
<a id='line_2384'>Men, brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence which I make now unto</a>
<a id='line_2385'>you.</a>
<a id='line_2386'></a>
<a id='line_2387'>22:2 (And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them,</a>
<a id='line_2388'>they kept the more silence: and he saith,) 22:3 I am verily a man</a>
<a id='line_2389'>which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in</a>
<a id='line_2390'>this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect</a>
<a id='line_2391'>manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye</a>
<a id='line_2392'>all are this day.</a>
<a id='line_2393'></a>
<a id='line_2394'>22:4 And I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering</a>
<a id='line_2395'>into prisons both men and women.</a>
<a id='line_2396'></a>
<a id='line_2397'>22:5 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate</a>
<a id='line_2398'>of the elders: from whom also I received letters unto the brethren,</a>
<a id='line_2399'>and went to Damascus, to bring them which were there bound unto</a>
<a id='line_2400'>Jerusalem, for to be punished.</a>
<a id='line_2401'></a>
<a id='line_2402'>22:6 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come</a>
<a id='line_2403'>nigh unto Damascus about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a</a>
<a id='line_2404'>great light round about me.</a>
<a id='line_2405'></a>
<a id='line_2406'>22:7 And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me,</a>
<a id='line_2407'>Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?  22:8 And I answered, Who art</a>
<a id='line_2408'>thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou</a>
<a id='line_2409'>persecutest.</a>
<a id='line_2410'></a>
<a id='line_2411'>22:9 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid;</a>
<a id='line_2412'>but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.</a>
<a id='line_2413'></a>
<a id='line_2414'>22:10 And I said, What shall I do, LORD? And the Lord said unto me,</a>
<a id='line_2415'>Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all</a>
<a id='line_2416'>things which are appointed for thee to do.</a>
<a id='line_2417'></a>
<a id='line_2418'>22:11 And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led</a>
<a id='line_2419'>by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.</a>
<a id='line_2420'></a>
<a id='line_2421'>22:12 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a</a>
<a id='line_2422'>good report of all the Jews which dwelt there, 22:13 Came unto me, and</a>
<a id='line_2423'>stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same</a>
<a id='line_2424'>hour I looked up upon him.</a>
<a id='line_2425'></a>
<a id='line_2426'>22:14 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou</a>
<a id='line_2427'>shouldest know his will, and see that Just One, and shouldest hear the</a>
<a id='line_2428'>voice of his mouth.</a>
<a id='line_2429'></a>
<a id='line_2430'>22:15 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast</a>
<a id='line_2431'>seen and heard.</a>
<a id='line_2432'></a>
<a id='line_2433'>22:16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away</a>
<a id='line_2434'>thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_2435'></a>
<a id='line_2436'>22:17 And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_2437'>even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance; 22:18 And saw</a>
<a id='line_2438'>him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem:</a>
<a id='line_2439'>for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</a>
<a id='line_2440'></a>
<a id='line_2441'>22:19 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every</a>
<a id='line_2442'>synagogue them that believed on thee: 22:20 And when the blood of thy</a>
<a id='line_2443'>martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto</a>
<a id='line_2444'>his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.</a>
<a id='line_2445'></a>
<a id='line_2446'>22:21 And he said unto me, Depart: for I will send thee far hence unto</a>
<a id='line_2447'>the Gentiles.</a>
<a id='line_2448'></a>
<a id='line_2449'>22:22 And they gave him audience unto this word, and then lifted up</a>
<a id='line_2450'>their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it</a>
<a id='line_2451'>is not fit that he should live.</a>
<a id='line_2452'></a>
<a id='line_2453'>22:23 And as they cried out, and cast off their clothes, and threw</a>
<a id='line_2454'>dust into the air, 22:24 The chief captain commanded him to be brought</a>
<a id='line_2455'>into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging;</a>
<a id='line_2456'>that he might know wherefore they cried so against him.</a>
<a id='line_2457'></a>
<a id='line_2458'>22:25 And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion</a>
<a id='line_2459'>that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman,</a>
<a id='line_2460'>and uncondemned?  22:26 When the centurion heard that, he went and</a>
<a id='line_2461'>told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest: for this</a>
<a id='line_2462'>man is a Roman.</a>
<a id='line_2463'></a>
<a id='line_2464'>22:27 Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art</a>
<a id='line_2465'>thou a Roman? He said, Yea.</a>
<a id='line_2466'></a>
<a id='line_2467'>22:28 And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this</a>
<a id='line_2468'>freedom. And Paul said, But I was free born.</a>
<a id='line_2469'></a>
<a id='line_2470'>22:29 Then straightway they departed from him which should have</a>
<a id='line_2471'>examined him: and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew</a>
<a id='line_2472'>that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</a>
<a id='line_2473'></a>
<a id='line_2474'>22:30 On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty</a>
<a id='line_2475'>wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands,</a>
<a id='line_2476'>and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and</a>
<a id='line_2477'>brought Paul down, and set him before them.</a>
<a id='line_2478'></a>
<a id='line_2479'>23:1 And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and</a>
<a id='line_2480'>brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this</a>
<a id='line_2481'>day.</a>
<a id='line_2482'></a>
<a id='line_2483'>23:2 And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to</a>
<a id='line_2484'>smite him on the mouth.</a>
<a id='line_2485'></a>
<a id='line_2486'>23:3 Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, thou whited wall:</a>
<a id='line_2487'>for sittest thou to judge me after the law, and commandest me to be</a>
<a id='line_2488'>smitten contrary to the law?  23:4 And they that stood by said,</a>
<a id='line_2489'>Revilest thou Godâ€™s high priest?  23:5 Then said Paul, I wist not,</a>
<a id='line_2490'>brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, Thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_2491'>not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.</a>
<a id='line_2492'></a>
<a id='line_2493'>23:6 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the</a>
<a id='line_2494'>other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brethren, I am a</a>
<a id='line_2495'>Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the</a>
<a id='line_2496'>dead I am called in question.</a>
<a id='line_2497'></a>
<a id='line_2498'>23:7 And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the</a>
<a id='line_2499'>Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the multitude was divided.</a>
<a id='line_2500'></a>
<a id='line_2501'>23:8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither</a>
<a id='line_2502'>angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.</a>
<a id='line_2503'></a>
<a id='line_2504'>23:9 And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the</a>
<a id='line_2505'>Phariseesâ€™ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this</a>
<a id='line_2506'>man: but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him, let us not fight</a>
<a id='line_2507'>against God.</a>
<a id='line_2508'></a>
<a id='line_2509'>23:10 And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain,</a>
<a id='line_2510'>fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded</a>
<a id='line_2511'>the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and</a>
<a id='line_2512'>to bring him into the castle.</a>
<a id='line_2513'></a>
<a id='line_2514'>23:11 And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of</a>
<a id='line_2515'>good cheer, Paul: for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so</a>
<a id='line_2516'>must thou bear witness also at Rome.</a>
<a id='line_2517'></a>
<a id='line_2518'>23:12 And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and</a>
<a id='line_2519'>bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor</a>
<a id='line_2520'>drink till they had killed Paul.</a>
<a id='line_2521'></a>
<a id='line_2522'>23:13 And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.</a>
<a id='line_2523'></a>
<a id='line_2524'>23:14 And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have</a>
<a id='line_2525'>bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we</a>
<a id='line_2526'>have slain Paul.</a>
<a id='line_2527'></a>
<a id='line_2528'>23:15 Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain</a>
<a id='line_2529'>that he bring him down unto you to morrow, as though ye would enquire</a>
<a id='line_2530'>something more perfectly concerning him: and we, or ever he come near,</a>
<a id='line_2531'>are ready to kill him.</a>
<a id='line_2532'></a>
<a id='line_2533'>23:16 And when Paulâ€™s sisterâ€™s son heard of their lying in wait, he</a>
<a id='line_2534'>went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.</a>
<a id='line_2535'></a>
<a id='line_2536'>23:17 Then Paul called one of the centurions unto him, and said, Bring</a>
<a id='line_2537'>this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to</a>
<a id='line_2538'>tell him.</a>
<a id='line_2539'></a>
<a id='line_2540'>23:18 So he took him, and brought him to the chief captain, and said,</a>
<a id='line_2541'>Paul the prisoner called me unto him, and prayed me to bring this</a>
<a id='line_2542'>young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_2543'></a>
<a id='line_2544'>23:19 Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went with him</a>
<a id='line_2545'>aside privately, and asked him, What is that thou hast to tell me?</a>
<a id='line_2546'>23:20 And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou</a>
<a id='line_2547'>wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they</a>
<a id='line_2548'>would enquire somewhat of him more perfectly.</a>
<a id='line_2549'></a>
<a id='line_2550'>23:21 But do not thou yield unto them: for there lie in wait for him</a>
<a id='line_2551'>of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath,</a>
<a id='line_2552'>that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and</a>
<a id='line_2553'>now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.</a>
<a id='line_2554'></a>
<a id='line_2555'>23:22 So the chief captain then let the young man depart, and charged</a>
<a id='line_2556'>him, See thou tell no man that thou hast shewed these things to me.</a>
<a id='line_2557'></a>
<a id='line_2558'>23:23 And he called unto him two centurions, saying, Make ready two</a>
<a id='line_2559'>hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten,</a>
<a id='line_2560'>and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night; 23:24 And</a>
<a id='line_2561'>provide them beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring him safe</a>
<a id='line_2562'>unto Felix the governor.</a>
<a id='line_2563'></a>
<a id='line_2564'>23:25 And he wrote a letter after this manner: 23:26 Claudius Lysias</a>
<a id='line_2565'>unto the most excellent governor Felix sendeth greeting.</a>
<a id='line_2566'></a>
<a id='line_2567'>23:27 This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of</a>
<a id='line_2568'>them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood</a>
<a id='line_2569'>that he was a Roman.</a>
<a id='line_2570'></a>
<a id='line_2571'>23:28 And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused</a>
<a id='line_2572'>him, I brought him forth into their council: 23:29 Whom I perceived to</a>
<a id='line_2573'>be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his</a>
<a id='line_2574'>charge worthy of death or of bonds.</a>
<a id='line_2575'></a>
<a id='line_2576'>23:30 And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man,</a>
<a id='line_2577'>I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also</a>
<a id='line_2578'>to say before thee what they had against him. Farewell.</a>
<a id='line_2579'></a>
<a id='line_2580'>23:31 Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and</a>
<a id='line_2581'>brought him by night to Antipatris.</a>
<a id='line_2582'></a>
<a id='line_2583'>23:32 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and</a>
<a id='line_2584'>returned to the castle: 23:33 Who, when they came to Caesarea and</a>
<a id='line_2585'>delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</a>
<a id='line_2586'></a>
<a id='line_2587'>23:34 And when the governor had read the letter, he asked of what</a>
<a id='line_2588'>province he was. And when he understood that he was of Cilicia; 23:35</a>
<a id='line_2589'>I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he</a>
<a id='line_2590'>commanded him to be kept in Herodâ€™s judgment hall.</a>
<a id='line_2591'></a>
<a id='line_2592'>24:1 And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the</a>
<a id='line_2593'>elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the</a>
<a id='line_2594'>governor against Paul.</a>
<a id='line_2595'></a>
<a id='line_2596'>24:2 And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse him,</a>
<a id='line_2597'>saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very</a>
<a id='line_2598'>worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence, 24:3 We</a>
<a id='line_2599'>accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all</a>
<a id='line_2600'>thankfulness.</a>
<a id='line_2601'></a>
<a id='line_2602'>24:4 Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray</a>
<a id='line_2603'>thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.</a>
<a id='line_2604'></a>
<a id='line_2605'>24:5 For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of</a>
<a id='line_2606'>sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of</a>
<a id='line_2607'>the sect of the Nazarenes: 24:6 Who also hath gone about to profane</a>
<a id='line_2608'>the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.</a>
<a id='line_2609'></a>
<a id='line_2610'>24:7 But the chief captain Lysias came upon us, and with great</a>
<a id='line_2611'>violence took him away out of our hands, 24:8 Commanding his accusers</a>
<a id='line_2612'>to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge</a>
<a id='line_2613'>of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</a>
<a id='line_2614'></a>
<a id='line_2615'>24:9 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.</a>
<a id='line_2616'></a>
<a id='line_2617'>24:10 Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to</a>
<a id='line_2618'>speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years</a>
<a id='line_2619'>a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself:</a>
<a id='line_2620'>24:11 Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but</a>
<a id='line_2621'>twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</a>
<a id='line_2622'></a>
<a id='line_2623'>24:12 And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man,</a>
<a id='line_2624'>neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the</a>
<a id='line_2625'>city: 24:13 Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse</a>
<a id='line_2626'>me.</a>
<a id='line_2627'></a>
<a id='line_2628'>24:14 But this I confess unto thee, that after the way which they call</a>
<a id='line_2629'>heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which</a>
<a id='line_2630'>are written in the law and in the prophets: 24:15 And have hope toward</a>
<a id='line_2631'>God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a</a>
<a id='line_2632'>resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</a>
<a id='line_2633'></a>
<a id='line_2634'>24:16 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience</a>
<a id='line_2635'>void to offence toward God, and toward men.</a>
<a id='line_2636'></a>
<a id='line_2637'>24:17 Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and</a>
<a id='line_2638'>offerings.</a>
<a id='line_2639'></a>
<a id='line_2640'>24:18 Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the</a>
<a id='line_2641'>temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult.</a>
<a id='line_2642'></a>
<a id='line_2643'>24:19 Who ought to have been here before thee, and object, if they had</a>
<a id='line_2644'>ought against me.</a>
<a id='line_2645'></a>
<a id='line_2646'>24:20 Or else let these same here say, if they have found any evil</a>
<a id='line_2647'>doing in me, while I stood before the council, 24:21 Except it be for</a>
<a id='line_2648'>this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the</a>
<a id='line_2649'>resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.</a>
<a id='line_2650'></a>
<a id='line_2651'>24:22 And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge</a>
<a id='line_2652'>of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain</a>
<a id='line_2653'>shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.</a>
<a id='line_2654'></a>
<a id='line_2655'>24:23 And he commanded a centurion to keep Paul, and to let him have</a>
<a id='line_2656'>liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to</a>
<a id='line_2657'>minister or come unto him.</a>
<a id='line_2658'></a>
<a id='line_2659'>24:24 And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla,</a>
<a id='line_2660'>which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the</a>
<a id='line_2661'>faith in Christ.</a>
<a id='line_2662'></a>
<a id='line_2663'>24:25 And as he reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to</a>
<a id='line_2664'>come, Felix trembled, and answered, Go thy way for this time; when I</a>
<a id='line_2665'>have a convenient season, I will call for thee.</a>
<a id='line_2666'></a>
<a id='line_2667'>24:26 He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul,</a>
<a id='line_2668'>that he might loose him: wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and</a>
<a id='line_2669'>communed with him.</a>
<a id='line_2670'></a>
<a id='line_2671'>24:27 But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felixâ€™ room: and</a>
<a id='line_2672'>Felix, willing to shew the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.</a>
<a id='line_2673'></a>
<a id='line_2674'>25:1 Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he</a>
<a id='line_2675'>ascended from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_2676'></a>
<a id='line_2677'>25:2 Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him</a>
<a id='line_2678'>against Paul, and besought him, 25:3 And desired favour against him,</a>
<a id='line_2679'>that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to</a>
<a id='line_2680'>kill him.</a>
<a id='line_2681'></a>
<a id='line_2682'>25:4 But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and</a>
<a id='line_2683'>that he himself would depart shortly thither.</a>
<a id='line_2684'></a>
<a id='line_2685'>25:5 Let them therefore, said he, which among you are able, go down</a>
<a id='line_2686'>with me, and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.</a>
<a id='line_2687'></a>
<a id='line_2688'>25:6 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went</a>
<a id='line_2689'>down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat</a>
<a id='line_2690'>commanded Paul to be brought.</a>
<a id='line_2691'></a>
<a id='line_2692'>25:7 And when he was come, the Jews which came down from Jerusalem</a>
<a id='line_2693'>stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul,</a>
<a id='line_2694'>which they could not prove.</a>
<a id='line_2695'></a>
<a id='line_2696'>25:8 While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the</a>
<a id='line_2697'>Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I</a>
<a id='line_2698'>offended any thing at all.</a>
<a id='line_2699'></a>
<a id='line_2700'>25:9 But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and</a>
<a id='line_2701'>said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these</a>
<a id='line_2702'>things before me?  25:10 Then said Paul, I stand at Caesarâ€™s judgment</a>
<a id='line_2703'>seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as</a>
<a id='line_2704'>thou very well knowest.</a>
<a id='line_2705'></a>
<a id='line_2706'>25:11 For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of</a>
<a id='line_2707'>death, I refuse not to die: but if there be none of these things</a>
<a id='line_2708'>whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal</a>
<a id='line_2709'>unto Caesar.</a>
<a id='line_2710'></a>
<a id='line_2711'>25:12 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered,</a>
<a id='line_2712'>Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.</a>
<a id='line_2713'></a>
<a id='line_2714'>25:13 And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto</a>
<a id='line_2715'>Caesarea to salute Festus.</a>
<a id='line_2716'></a>
<a id='line_2717'>25:14 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paulâ€™s</a>
<a id='line_2718'>cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by</a>
<a id='line_2719'>Felix: 25:15 About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests</a>
<a id='line_2720'>and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment</a>
<a id='line_2721'>against him.</a>
<a id='line_2722'></a>
<a id='line_2723'>25:16 To whom I answered, It is not the manner of the Romans to</a>
<a id='line_2724'>deliver any man to die, before that he which is accused have the</a>
<a id='line_2725'>accusers face to face, and have licence to answer for himself</a>
<a id='line_2726'>concerning the crime laid against him.</a>
<a id='line_2727'></a>
<a id='line_2728'>25:17 Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the</a>
<a id='line_2729'>morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought</a>
<a id='line_2730'>forth.</a>
<a id='line_2731'></a>
<a id='line_2732'>25:18 Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none</a>
<a id='line_2733'>accusation of such things as I supposed: 25:19 But had certain</a>
<a id='line_2734'>questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus,</a>
<a id='line_2735'>which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</a>
<a id='line_2736'></a>
<a id='line_2737'>25:20 And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him</a>
<a id='line_2738'>whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these</a>
<a id='line_2739'>matters.</a>
<a id='line_2740'></a>
<a id='line_2741'>25:21 But when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of</a>
<a id='line_2742'>Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.</a>
<a id='line_2743'></a>
<a id='line_2744'>25:22 Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself.</a>
<a id='line_2745'>To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</a>
<a id='line_2746'></a>
<a id='line_2747'>25:23 And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with</a>
<a id='line_2748'>great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief</a>
<a id='line_2749'>captains, and principal men of the city, at Festusâ€™ commandment Paul</a>
<a id='line_2750'>was brought forth.</a>
<a id='line_2751'></a>
<a id='line_2752'>25:24 And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men which are here</a>
<a id='line_2753'>present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the</a>
<a id='line_2754'>Jews have dealt with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying that</a>
<a id='line_2755'>he ought not to live any longer.</a>
<a id='line_2756'></a>
<a id='line_2757'>25:25 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death,</a>
<a id='line_2758'>and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, I have determined to</a>
<a id='line_2759'>send him.</a>
<a id='line_2760'></a>
<a id='line_2761'>25:26 Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Wherefore</a>
<a id='line_2762'>I have brought him forth before you, and specially before thee, O king</a>
<a id='line_2763'>Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.</a>
<a id='line_2764'></a>
<a id='line_2765'>25:27 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not</a>
<a id='line_2766'>withal to signify the crimes laid against him.</a>
<a id='line_2767'></a>
<a id='line_2768'>26:1 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for</a>
<a id='line_2769'>thyself.</a>
<a id='line_2770'></a>
<a id='line_2771'>Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself: 26:2 I</a>
<a id='line_2772'>think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself</a>
<a id='line_2773'>this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of</a>
<a id='line_2774'>the Jews: 26:3 Especially because I know thee to be expert in all</a>
<a id='line_2775'>customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech</a>
<a id='line_2776'>thee to hear me patiently.</a>
<a id='line_2777'></a>
<a id='line_2778'>26:4 My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among</a>
<a id='line_2779'>mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; 26:5 Which knew me</a>
<a id='line_2780'>from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most</a>
<a id='line_2781'>straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</a>
<a id='line_2782'></a>
<a id='line_2783'>26:6 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of</a>
<a id='line_2784'>God, unto our fathers: 26:7 Unto which promise our twelve tribes,</a>
<a id='line_2785'>instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hopeâ€™s</a>
<a id='line_2786'>sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.</a>
<a id='line_2787'></a>
<a id='line_2788'>26:8 Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God</a>
<a id='line_2789'>should raise the dead?  26:9 I verily thought with myself, that I</a>
<a id='line_2790'>ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.</a>
<a id='line_2791'></a>
<a id='line_2792'>26:10 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did</a>
<a id='line_2793'>I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests;</a>
<a id='line_2794'>and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.</a>
<a id='line_2795'></a>
<a id='line_2796'>26:11 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them</a>
<a id='line_2797'>to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted</a>
<a id='line_2798'>them even unto strange cities.</a>
<a id='line_2799'></a>
<a id='line_2800'>26:12 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commission</a>
<a id='line_2801'>from the chief priests, 26:13 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a</a>
<a id='line_2802'>light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round</a>
<a id='line_2803'>about me and them which journeyed with me.</a>
<a id='line_2804'></a>
<a id='line_2805'>26:14 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice</a>
<a id='line_2806'>speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why</a>
<a id='line_2807'>persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks.</a>
<a id='line_2808'></a>
<a id='line_2809'>26:15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom</a>
<a id='line_2810'>thou persecutest.</a>
<a id='line_2811'></a>
<a id='line_2812'>26:16 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee</a>
<a id='line_2813'>for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these</a>
<a id='line_2814'>things which thou hast seen, and of those things in the which I will</a>
<a id='line_2815'>appear unto thee; 26:17 Delivering thee from the people, and from the</a>
<a id='line_2816'>Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, 26:18 To open their eyes, and to</a>
<a id='line_2817'>turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto</a>
<a id='line_2818'>God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among</a>
<a id='line_2819'>them which are sanctified by faith that is in me.</a>
<a id='line_2820'></a>
<a id='line_2821'>26:19 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the</a>
<a id='line_2822'>heavenly vision: 26:20 But shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at</a>
<a id='line_2823'>Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the</a>
<a id='line_2824'>Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet</a>
<a id='line_2825'>for repentance.</a>
<a id='line_2826'></a>
<a id='line_2827'>26:21 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went</a>
<a id='line_2828'>about to kill me.</a>
<a id='line_2829'></a>
<a id='line_2830'>26:22 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day,</a>
<a id='line_2831'>witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than</a>
<a id='line_2832'>those which the prophets and Moses did say should come: 26:23 That</a>
<a id='line_2833'>Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise</a>
<a id='line_2834'>from the dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the</a>
<a id='line_2835'>Gentiles.</a>
<a id='line_2836'></a>
<a id='line_2837'>26:24 And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice,</a>
<a id='line_2838'>Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.</a>
<a id='line_2839'></a>
<a id='line_2840'>26:25 But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth</a>
<a id='line_2841'>the words of truth and soberness.</a>
<a id='line_2842'></a>
<a id='line_2843'>26:26 For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak</a>
<a id='line_2844'>freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from</a>
<a id='line_2845'>him; for this thing was not done in a corner.</a>
<a id='line_2846'></a>
<a id='line_2847'>26:27 King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou</a>
<a id='line_2848'>believest.</a>
<a id='line_2849'></a>
<a id='line_2850'>26:28 Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a</a>
<a id='line_2851'>Christian.</a>
<a id='line_2852'></a>
<a id='line_2853'>26:29 And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all</a>
<a id='line_2854'>that hear me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as I am,</a>
<a id='line_2855'>except these bonds.</a>
<a id='line_2856'></a>
<a id='line_2857'>26:30 And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the governor,</a>
<a id='line_2858'>and Bernice, and they that sat with them: 26:31 And when they were</a>
<a id='line_2859'>gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth</a>
<a id='line_2860'>nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</a>
<a id='line_2861'></a>
<a id='line_2862'>26:32 Then said Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at</a>
<a id='line_2863'>liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.</a>
<a id='line_2864'></a>
<a id='line_2865'>27:1 And when it was determined that we should sail into Italy, they</a>
<a id='line_2866'>delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto one named Julius, a</a>
<a id='line_2867'>centurion of Augustusâ€™ band.</a>
<a id='line_2868'></a>
<a id='line_2869'>27:2 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to</a>
<a id='line_2870'>sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of</a>
<a id='line_2871'>Thessalonica, being with us.</a>
<a id='line_2872'></a>
<a id='line_2873'>27:3 And the next day we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously</a>
<a id='line_2874'>entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh</a>
<a id='line_2875'>himself.</a>
<a id='line_2876'></a>
<a id='line_2877'>27:4 And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus,</a>
<a id='line_2878'>because the winds were contrary.</a>
<a id='line_2879'></a>
<a id='line_2880'>27:5 And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we</a>
<a id='line_2881'>came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</a>
<a id='line_2882'></a>
<a id='line_2883'>27:6 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into</a>
<a id='line_2884'>Italy; and he put us therein.</a>
<a id='line_2885'></a>
<a id='line_2886'>27:7 And when we had sailed slowly many days, and scarce were come</a>
<a id='line_2887'>over against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete,</a>
<a id='line_2888'>over against Salmone; 27:8 And, hardly passing it, came unto a place</a>
<a id='line_2889'>which is called The fair havens; nigh whereunto was the city of Lasea.</a>
<a id='line_2890'></a>
<a id='line_2891'>27:9 Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous,</a>
<a id='line_2892'>because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them, 27:10 And</a>
<a id='line_2893'>said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt</a>
<a id='line_2894'>and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our</a>
<a id='line_2895'>lives.</a>
<a id='line_2896'></a>
<a id='line_2897'>27:11 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of</a>
<a id='line_2898'>the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.</a>
<a id='line_2899'></a>
<a id='line_2900'>27:12 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more</a>
<a id='line_2901'>part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain</a>
<a id='line_2902'>to Phenice, and there to winter; which is an haven of Crete, and lieth</a>
<a id='line_2903'>toward the south west and north west.</a>
<a id='line_2904'></a>
<a id='line_2905'>27:13 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had</a>
<a id='line_2906'>obtained their purpose, loosing thence, they sailed close by Crete.</a>
<a id='line_2907'></a>
<a id='line_2908'>27:14 But not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind,</a>
<a id='line_2909'>called Euroclydon.</a>
<a id='line_2910'></a>
<a id='line_2911'>27:15 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the</a>
<a id='line_2912'>wind, we let her drive.</a>
<a id='line_2913'></a>
<a id='line_2914'>27:16 And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we</a>
<a id='line_2915'>had much work to come by the boat: 27:17 Which when they had taken up,</a>
<a id='line_2916'>they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should</a>
<a id='line_2917'>fall into the quicksands, strake sail, and so were driven.</a>
<a id='line_2918'></a>
<a id='line_2919'>27:18 And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next day</a>
<a id='line_2920'>they lightened the ship; 27:19 And the third day we cast out with our</a>
<a id='line_2921'>own hands the tackling of the ship.</a>
<a id='line_2922'></a>
<a id='line_2923'>27:20 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no</a>
<a id='line_2924'>small tempest lay on us, all hope that we should be saved was then</a>
<a id='line_2925'>taken away.</a>
<a id='line_2926'></a>
<a id='line_2927'>27:21 But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them,</a>
<a id='line_2928'>and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed</a>
<a id='line_2929'>from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.</a>
<a id='line_2930'></a>
<a id='line_2931'>27:22 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no</a>
<a id='line_2932'>loss of any manâ€™s life among you, but of the ship.</a>
<a id='line_2933'></a>
<a id='line_2934'>27:23 For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am,</a>
<a id='line_2935'>and whom I serve, 27:24 Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought</a>
<a id='line_2936'>before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with</a>
<a id='line_2937'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_2938'></a>
<a id='line_2939'>27:25 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it</a>
<a id='line_2940'>shall be even as it was told me.</a>
<a id='line_2941'></a>
<a id='line_2942'>27:26 Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.</a>
<a id='line_2943'></a>
<a id='line_2944'>27:27 But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and</a>
<a id='line_2945'>down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near</a>
<a id='line_2946'>to some country; 27:28 And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and</a>
<a id='line_2947'>when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it</a>
<a id='line_2948'>fifteen fathoms.</a>
<a id='line_2949'></a>
<a id='line_2950'>27:29 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast</a>
<a id='line_2951'>four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.</a>
<a id='line_2952'></a>
<a id='line_2953'>27:30 And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they</a>
<a id='line_2954'>had let down the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would</a>
<a id='line_2955'>have cast anchors out of the foreship, 27:31 Paul said to the</a>
<a id='line_2956'>centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye</a>
<a id='line_2957'>cannot be saved.</a>
<a id='line_2958'></a>
<a id='line_2959'>27:32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her</a>
<a id='line_2960'>fall off.</a>
<a id='line_2961'></a>
<a id='line_2962'>27:33 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take</a>
<a id='line_2963'>meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and</a>
<a id='line_2964'>continued fasting, having taken nothing.</a>
<a id='line_2965'></a>
<a id='line_2966'>27:34 Wherefore I pray you to take some meat: for this is for your</a>
<a id='line_2967'>health: for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.</a>
<a id='line_2968'></a>
<a id='line_2969'>27:35 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to</a>
<a id='line_2970'>God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to</a>
<a id='line_2971'>eat.</a>
<a id='line_2972'></a>
<a id='line_2973'>27:36 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took some meat.</a>
<a id='line_2974'></a>
<a id='line_2975'>27:37 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and</a>
<a id='line_2976'>sixteen souls.</a>
<a id='line_2977'></a>
<a id='line_2978'>27:38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and</a>
<a id='line_2979'>cast out the wheat into the sea.</a>
<a id='line_2980'></a>
<a id='line_2981'>27:39 And when it was day, they knew not the land: but they discovered</a>
<a id='line_2982'>a certain creek with a shore, into the which they were minded, if it</a>
<a id='line_2983'>were possible, to thrust in the ship.</a>
<a id='line_2984'></a>
<a id='line_2985'>27:40 And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed</a>
<a id='line_2986'>themselves unto the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoised up</a>
<a id='line_2987'>the mainsail to the wind, and made toward shore.</a>
<a id='line_2988'></a>
<a id='line_2989'>27:41 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship</a>
<a id='line_2990'>aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the</a>
<a id='line_2991'>hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.</a>
<a id='line_2992'></a>
<a id='line_2993'>27:42 And the soldiersâ€™ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of</a>
<a id='line_2994'>them should swim out, and escape.</a>
<a id='line_2995'></a>
<a id='line_2996'>27:43 But the centurion, willing to save Paul, kept them from their</a>
<a id='line_2997'>purpose; and commanded that they which could swim should cast</a>
<a id='line_2998'>themselves first into the sea, and get to land: 27:44 And the rest,</a>
<a id='line_2999'>some on boards, and some on broken pieces of the ship.</a>
<a id='line_3000'></a>
<a id='line_3001'>And so it came to pass, that they escaped all safe to land.</a>
<a id='line_3002'></a>
<a id='line_3003'>28:1 And when they were escaped, then they knew that the island was</a>
<a id='line_3004'>called Melita.</a>
<a id='line_3005'></a>
<a id='line_3006'>28:2 And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they</a>
<a id='line_3007'>kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present</a>
<a id='line_3008'>rain, and because of the cold.</a>
<a id='line_3009'></a>
<a id='line_3010'>28:3 And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on</a>
<a id='line_3011'>the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his</a>
<a id='line_3012'>hand.</a>
<a id='line_3013'></a>
<a id='line_3014'>28:4 And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand,</a>
<a id='line_3015'>they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom,</a>
<a id='line_3016'>though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live.</a>
<a id='line_3017'></a>
<a id='line_3018'>28:5 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.</a>
<a id='line_3019'></a>
<a id='line_3020'>28:6 Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down</a>
<a id='line_3021'>dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no</a>
<a id='line_3022'>harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a</a>
<a id='line_3023'>god.</a>
<a id='line_3024'></a>
<a id='line_3025'>28:7 In the same quarters were possessions of the chief man of the</a>
<a id='line_3026'>island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three</a>
<a id='line_3027'>days courteously.</a>
<a id='line_3028'></a>
<a id='line_3029'>28:8 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of a</a>
<a id='line_3030'>fever and of a bloody flux: to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and</a>
<a id='line_3031'>laid his hands on him, and healed him.</a>
<a id='line_3032'></a>
<a id='line_3033'>28:9 So when this was done, others also, which had diseases in the</a>
<a id='line_3034'>island, came, and were healed: 28:10 Who also honoured us with many</a>
<a id='line_3035'>honours; and when we departed, they laded us with such things as were</a>
<a id='line_3036'>necessary.</a>
<a id='line_3037'></a>
<a id='line_3038'>28:11 And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria,</a>
<a id='line_3039'>which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</a>
<a id='line_3040'></a>
<a id='line_3041'>28:12 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days.</a>
<a id='line_3042'></a>
<a id='line_3043'>28:13 And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and</a>
<a id='line_3044'>after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to</a>
<a id='line_3045'>Puteoli: 28:14 Where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with</a>
<a id='line_3046'>them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.</a>
<a id='line_3047'></a>
<a id='line_3048'>28:15 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to</a>
<a id='line_3049'>meet us as far as Appii forum, and The three taverns: whom when Paul</a>
<a id='line_3050'>saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</a>
<a id='line_3051'></a>
<a id='line_3052'>28:16 And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners</a>
<a id='line_3053'>to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself</a>
<a id='line_3054'>with a soldier that kept him.</a>
<a id='line_3055'></a>
<a id='line_3056'>28:17 And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief</a>
<a id='line_3057'>of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said unto</a>
<a id='line_3058'>them, Men and brethren, though I have committed nothing against the</a>
<a id='line_3059'>people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from</a>
<a id='line_3060'>Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.</a>
<a id='line_3061'></a>
<a id='line_3062'>28:18 Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because</a>
<a id='line_3063'>there was no cause of death in me.</a>
<a id='line_3064'></a>
<a id='line_3065'>28:19 But when the Jews spake against it, I was constrained to appeal</a>
<a id='line_3066'>unto Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.</a>
<a id='line_3067'></a>
<a id='line_3068'>28:20 For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and</a>
<a id='line_3069'>to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with</a>
<a id='line_3070'>this chain.</a>
<a id='line_3071'></a>
<a id='line_3072'>28:21 And they said unto him, We neither received letters out of</a>
<a id='line_3073'>Judaea concerning thee, neither any of the brethren that came shewed</a>
<a id='line_3074'>or spake any harm of thee.</a>
<a id='line_3075'></a>
<a id='line_3076'>28:22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as</a>
<a id='line_3077'>concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</a>
<a id='line_3078'></a>
<a id='line_3079'>28:23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him</a>
<a id='line_3080'>into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_3081'>God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses,</a>
<a id='line_3082'>and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.</a>
<a id='line_3083'></a>
<a id='line_3084'>28:24 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some</a>
<a id='line_3085'>believed not.</a>
<a id='line_3086'></a>
<a id='line_3087'>28:25 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after</a>
<a id='line_3088'>that Paul had spoken one word, Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the</a>
<a id='line_3089'>prophet unto our fathers, 28:26 Saying, Go unto this people, and say,</a>
<a id='line_3090'>Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall</a>
<a id='line_3091'>see, and not perceive: 28:27 For the heart of this people is waxed</a>
<a id='line_3092'>gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they</a>
<a id='line_3093'>closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their</a>
<a id='line_3094'>ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I</a>
<a id='line_3095'>should heal them.</a>
<a id='line_3096'></a>
<a id='line_3097'>28:28 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is</a>
<a id='line_3098'>sent unto the Gentiles, and that they will hear it.</a>
<a id='line_3099'></a>
<a id='line_3100'>28:29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had</a>
<a id='line_3101'>great reasoning among themselves.</a>
<a id='line_3102'></a>
<a id='line_3103'>28:30 And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and</a>
<a id='line_3104'>received all that came in unto him, 28:31 Preaching the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_3105'>God, and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ,</a>
<a id='line_3106'>with all confidence, no man forbidding him.</a>
