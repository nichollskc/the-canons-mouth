<a id='line_20'>PREFACE.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'></a>
<a id='line_23'>Knowing within myself the manner in which this Poem has been</a>
<a id='line_24'>produced, it is not without a feeling of regret that I make it</a>
<a id='line_25'>public.</a>
<a id='line_26'></a>
<a id='line_27'>What manner I mean, will be quite clear to the reader, who must soon</a>
<a id='line_28'>perceive great inexperience, immaturity, and every error denoting a</a>
<a id='line_29'>feverish attempt, rather than a deed accomplished. The two first</a>
<a id='line_30'>books, and indeed the two last, I feel sensible are not of such</a>
<a id='line_31'>completion as to warrant their passing the press; nor should they if</a>
<a id='line_32'>I thought a year's castigation would do them any good;--it will not:</a>
<a id='line_33'>the foundations are too sandy. It is just that this youngster should</a>
<a id='line_34'>die away: a sad thought for me, if I had not some hope that while it</a>
<a id='line_35'>is dwindling I may be plotting, and fitting myself for verses fit to</a>
<a id='line_36'>live.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>This may be speaking too presumptuously, and may deserve a</a>
<a id='line_39'>punishment: but no feeling man will be forward to inflict it: he will</a>
<a id='line_40'>leave me alone, with the conviction that there is not a fiercer hell</a>
<a id='line_41'>than the failure in a great object. This is not written with the</a>
<a id='line_42'>least atom of purpose to forestall criticisms of course, but from the</a>
<a id='line_43'>desire I have to conciliate men who are competent to look, and who do</a>
<a id='line_44'>look with a zealous eye, to the honour of English literature.</a>
<a id='line_45'></a>
<a id='line_46'>The imagination of a boy is healthy, and the mature imagination of a</a>
<a id='line_47'>man is healthy; but there is a space of life between, in which the</a>
<a id='line_48'>soul is in a ferment, the character undecided, the way of life</a>
<a id='line_49'>uncertain, the ambition thick-sighted: thence proceeds mawkishness,</a>
<a id='line_50'>and all the thousand bitters which those men I speak of must</a>
<a id='line_51'>necessarily taste in going over the following pages.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>I hope I have not in too late a day touched the beautiful mythology</a>
<a id='line_54'>of Greece, and dulled its brightness: for I wish to try once more,</a>
<a id='line_55'>before I bid it farewel.</a>

<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>  A thing of beauty is a joy for ever:</a>
<a id='line_77'>  Its loveliness increases; it will never</a>
<a id='line_78'>  Pass into nothingness; but still will keep</a>
<a id='line_79'>  A bower quiet for us, and a sleep</a>
<a id='line_80'>  Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing.</a>
<a id='line_81'>  Therefore, on every morrow, are we wreathing</a>
<a id='line_82'>  A flowery band to bind us to the earth,</a>
<a id='line_83'>  Spite of despondence, of the inhuman dearth</a>
<a id='line_84'>  Of noble natures, of the gloomy days,</a>
<a id='line_85'>  Of all the unhealthy and o'er-darkened ways                    10</a>
<a id='line_86'>  Made for our searching: yes, in spite of all,</a>
<a id='line_87'>  Some shape of beauty moves away the pall</a>
<a id='line_88'>  From our dark spirits. Such the sun, the moon,</a>
<a id='line_89'>  Trees old and young, sprouting a shady boon</a>
<a id='line_90'>  For simple sheep; and such are daffodils</a>
<a id='line_91'>  With the green world they live in; and clear rills</a>
<a id='line_92'>  That for themselves a cooling covert make</a>
<a id='line_93'>  'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,</a>
<a id='line_94'>  Rich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:</a>
<a id='line_95'>  And such too is the grandeur of the dooms                      20</a>
<a id='line_96'>  We have imagined for the mighty dead;</a>
<a id='line_97'>  All lovely tales that we have heard or read:</a>
<a id='line_98'>  An endless fountain of immortal drink,</a>
<a id='line_99'>  Pouring unto us from the heaven's brink.</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>    Nor do we merely feel these essences</a>
<a id='line_102'>  For one short hour; no, even as the trees</a>
<a id='line_103'>  That whisper round a temple become soon</a>
<a id='line_104'>  Dear as the temple's self, so does the moon,</a>
<a id='line_105'>  The passion poesy, glories infinite,</a>
<a id='line_106'>  Haunt us till they become a cheering light                     30</a>
<a id='line_107'>  Unto our souls, and bound to us so fast,</a>
<a id='line_108'>  That, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast,</a>
<a id='line_109'>  They alway must be with us, or we die.</a>
<a id='line_110'></a>
<a id='line_111'>    Therefore, 'tis with full happiness that I</a>
<a id='line_112'>  Will trace the story of Endymion.</a>
<a id='line_113'>  The very music of the name has gone</a>
<a id='line_114'>  Into my being, and each pleasant scene</a>
<a id='line_115'>  Is growing fresh before me as the green</a>
<a id='line_116'>  Of our own vallies: so I will begin</a>
<a id='line_117'>  Now while I cannot hear the city's din;                        40</a>
<a id='line_118'>  Now while the early budders are just new,</a>
<a id='line_119'>  And run in mazes of the youngest hue</a>
<a id='line_120'>  About old forests; while the willow trails</a>
<a id='line_121'>  Its delicate amber; and the dairy pails</a>
<a id='line_122'>  Bring home increase of milk. And, as the year</a>
<a id='line_123'>  Grows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer</a>
<a id='line_124'>  My little boat, for many quiet hours,</a>
<a id='line_125'>  With streams that deepen freshly into bowers.</a>
<a id='line_126'>  Many and many a verse I hope to write,</a>
<a id='line_127'>  Before the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white,                  50</a>
<a id='line_128'>  Hide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees</a>
<a id='line_129'>  Hum about globes of clover and sweet peas,</a>
<a id='line_130'>  I must be near the middle of my story.</a>
<a id='line_131'>  O may no wintry season, bare and hoary,</a>
<a id='line_132'>  See it half finished: but let Autumn bold,</a>
<a id='line_133'>  With universal tinge of sober gold,</a>
<a id='line_134'>  Be all about me when I make an end.</a>
<a id='line_135'>  And now at once, adventuresome, I send</a>
<a id='line_136'>  My herald thought into a wilderness:</a>
<a id='line_137'>  There let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress                  60</a>
<a id='line_138'>  My uncertain path with green, that I may speed</a>
<a id='line_139'>  Easily onward, thorough flowers and weed.</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>    Upon the sides of Latmos was outspread</a>
<a id='line_142'>  A mighty forest; for the moist earth fed</a>
<a id='line_143'>  So plenteously all weed-hidden roots</a>
<a id='line_144'>  Into o'er-hanging boughs, and precious fruits.</a>
<a id='line_145'>  And it had gloomy shades, sequestered deep,</a>
<a id='line_146'>  Where no man went; and if from shepherd's keep</a>
<a id='line_147'>  A lamb strayed far a-down those inmost glens,</a>
<a id='line_148'>  Never again saw he the happy pens                              70</a>
<a id='line_149'>  Whither his brethren, bleating with content,</a>
<a id='line_150'>  Over the hills at every nightfall went.</a>
<a id='line_151'>  Among the shepherds, 'twas believed ever,</a>
<a id='line_152'>  That not one fleecy lamb which thus did sever</a>
<a id='line_153'>  From the white flock, but pass'd unworried</a>
<a id='line_154'>  By angry wolf, or pard with prying head,</a>
<a id='line_155'>  Until it came to some unfooted plains</a>
<a id='line_156'>  Where fed the herds of Pan: ay great his gains</a>
<a id='line_157'>  Who thus one lamb did lose. Paths there were many,</a>
<a id='line_158'>  Winding through palmy fern, and rushes fenny,                  80</a>
<a id='line_159'>  And ivy banks; all leading pleasantly</a>
<a id='line_160'>  To a wide lawn, whence one could only see</a>
<a id='line_161'>  Stems thronging all around between the swell</a>
<a id='line_162'>  Of turf and slanting branches: who could tell</a>
<a id='line_163'>  The freshness of the space of heaven above,</a>
<a id='line_164'>  Edg'd round with dark tree tops? through which a dove</a>
<a id='line_165'>  Would often beat its wings, and often too</a>
<a id='line_166'>  A little cloud would move across the blue.</a>
<a id='line_167'></a>
<a id='line_168'>    Full in the middle of this pleasantness</a>
<a id='line_169'>  There stood a marble altar, with a tress                       90</a>
<a id='line_170'>  Of flowers budded newly; and the dew</a>
<a id='line_171'>  Had taken fairy phantasies to strew</a>
<a id='line_172'>  Daisies upon the sacred sward last eve,</a>
<a id='line_173'>  And so the dawned light in pomp receive.</a>
<a id='line_174'>  For 'twas the morn: Apollo's upward fire</a>
<a id='line_175'>  Made every eastern cloud a silvery pyre</a>
<a id='line_176'>  Of brightness so unsullied, that therein</a>
<a id='line_177'>  A melancholy spirit well might win</a>
<a id='line_178'>  Oblivion, and melt out his essence fine</a>
<a id='line_179'>  Into the winds: rain-scented eglantine                        100</a>
<a id='line_180'>  Gave temperate sweets to that well-wooing sun;</a>
<a id='line_181'>  The lark was lost in him; cold springs had run</a>
<a id='line_182'>  To warm their chilliest bubbles in the grass;</a>
<a id='line_183'>  Man's voice was on the mountains; and the mass</a>
<a id='line_184'>  Of nature's lives and wonders puls'd tenfold,</a>
<a id='line_185'>  To feel this sun-rise and its glories old.</a>
<a id='line_186'></a>
<a id='line_187'>    Now while the silent workings of the dawn</a>
<a id='line_188'>  Were busiest, into that self-same lawn</a>
<a id='line_189'>  All suddenly, with joyful cries, there sped</a>
<a id='line_190'>  A troop of little children garlanded;                         110</a>
<a id='line_191'>  Who gathering round the altar, seemed to pry</a>
<a id='line_192'>  Earnestly round as wishing to espy</a>
<a id='line_193'>  Some folk of holiday: nor had they waited</a>
<a id='line_194'>  For many moments, ere their ears were sated</a>
<a id='line_195'>  With a faint breath of music, which ev'n then</a>
<a id='line_196'>  Fill'd out its voice, and died away again.</a>
<a id='line_197'>  Within a little space again it gave</a>
<a id='line_198'>  Its airy swellings, with a gentle wave,</a>
<a id='line_199'>  To light-hung leaves, in smoothest echoes breaking</a>
<a id='line_200'>  Through copse-clad vallies,--ere their death, o'ertaking</a>
<a id='line_201'>  The surgy murmurs of the lonely sea.                          121</a>
<a id='line_202'></a>
<a id='line_203'>    And now, as deep into the wood as we</a>
<a id='line_204'>  Might mark a lynx's eye, there glimmered light</a>
<a id='line_205'>  Fair faces and a rush of garments white,</a>
<a id='line_206'>  Plainer and plainer shewing, till at last</a>
<a id='line_207'>  Into the widest alley they all past,</a>
<a id='line_208'>  Making directly for the woodland altar.</a>
<a id='line_209'>  O kindly muse! let not my weak tongue faulter</a>
<a id='line_210'>  In telling of this goodly company,</a>
<a id='line_211'>  Of their old piety, and of their glee:                        130</a>
<a id='line_212'>  But let a portion of ethereal dew</a>
<a id='line_213'>  Fall on my head, and presently unmew</a>
<a id='line_214'>  My soul; that I may dare, in wayfaring,</a>
<a id='line_215'>  To stammer where old Chaucer used to sing.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>    Leading the way, young damsels danced along,</a>
<a id='line_218'>  Bearing the burden of a shepherd song;</a>
<a id='line_219'>  Each having a white wicker over brimm'd</a>
<a id='line_220'>  With April's tender younglings: next, well trimm'd,</a>
<a id='line_221'>  A crowd of shepherds with as sunburnt looks</a>
<a id='line_222'>  As may be read of in Arcadian books;                          140</a>
<a id='line_223'>  Such as sat listening round Apollo's pipe,</a>
<a id='line_224'>  When the great deity, for earth too ripe,</a>
<a id='line_225'>  Let his divinity o'er-flowing die</a>
<a id='line_226'>  In music, through the vales of Thessaly:</a>
<a id='line_227'>  Some idly trailed their sheep-hooks on the ground,</a>
<a id='line_228'>  And some kept up a shrilly mellow sound</a>
<a id='line_229'>  With ebon-tipped flutes: close after these,</a>
<a id='line_230'>  Now coming from beneath the forest trees,</a>
<a id='line_231'>  A venerable priest full soberly,</a>
<a id='line_232'>  Begirt with ministring looks: alway his eye                   150</a>
<a id='line_233'>  Stedfast upon the matted turf he kept,</a>
<a id='line_234'>  And after him his sacred vestments swept.</a>
<a id='line_235'>  From his right hand there swung a vase, milk-white,</a>
<a id='line_236'>  Of mingled wine, out-sparkling generous light;</a>
<a id='line_237'>  And in his left he held a basket full</a>
<a id='line_238'>  Of all sweet herbs that searching eye could cull:</a>
<a id='line_239'>  Wild thyme, and valley-lilies whiter still</a>
<a id='line_240'>  Than Leda's love, and cresses from the rill.</a>
<a id='line_241'>  His aged head, crowned with beechen wreath,</a>
<a id='line_242'>  Seem'd like a poll of ivy in the teeth                        160</a>
<a id='line_243'>  Of winter hoar. Then came another crowd</a>
<a id='line_244'>  Of shepherds, lifting in due time aloud</a>
<a id='line_245'>  Their share of the ditty. After them appear'd,</a>
<a id='line_246'>  Up-followed by a multitude that rear'd</a>
<a id='line_247'>  Their voices to the clouds, a fair wrought car,</a>
<a id='line_248'>  Easily rolling so as scarce to mar</a>
<a id='line_249'>  The freedom of three steeds of dapple brown:</a>
<a id='line_250'>  Who stood therein did seem of great renown</a>
<a id='line_251'>  Among the throng. His youth was fully blown,</a>
<a id='line_252'>  Shewing like Ganymede to manhood grown;                       170</a>
<a id='line_253'>  And, for those simple times, his garments were</a>
<a id='line_254'>  A chieftain king's: beneath his breast, half bare,</a>
<a id='line_255'>  Was hung a silver bugle, and between</a>
<a id='line_256'>  His nervy knees there lay a boar-spear keen.</a>
<a id='line_257'>  A smile was on his countenance; he seem'd,</a>
<a id='line_258'>  To common lookers on, like one who dream'd</a>
<a id='line_259'>  Of idleness in groves Elysian:</a>
<a id='line_260'>  But there were some who feelingly could scan</a>
<a id='line_261'>  A lurking trouble in his nether lip,</a>
<a id='line_262'>  And see that oftentimes the reins would slip                  180</a>
<a id='line_263'>  Through his forgotten hands: then would they sigh,</a>
<a id='line_264'>  And think of yellow leaves, of owlets cry,</a>
<a id='line_265'>  Of logs piled solemnly.--Ah, well-a-day,</a>
<a id='line_266'>  Why should our young Endymion pine away!</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>    Soon the assembly, in a circle rang'd,</a>
<a id='line_269'>  Stood silent round the shrine: each look was chang'd</a>
<a id='line_270'>  To sudden veneration: women meek</a>
<a id='line_271'>  Beckon'd their sons to silence; while each cheek</a>
<a id='line_272'>  Of virgin bloom paled gently for slight fear.</a>
<a id='line_273'>  Endymion too, without a forest peer,                          190</a>
<a id='line_274'>  Stood, wan, and pale, and with an awed face,</a>
<a id='line_275'>  Among his brothers of the mountain chase.</a>
<a id='line_276'>  In midst of all, the venerable priest</a>
<a id='line_277'>  Eyed them with joy from greatest to the least,</a>
<a id='line_278'>  And, after lifting up his aged hands,</a>
<a id='line_279'>  Thus spake he: "Men of Latmos! shepherd bands!</a>
<a id='line_280'>  Whose care it is to guard a thousand flocks:</a>
<a id='line_281'>  Whether descended from beneath the rocks</a>
<a id='line_282'>  That overtop your mountains; whether come</a>
<a id='line_283'>  From vallies where the pipe is never dumb;                    200</a>
<a id='line_284'>  Or from your swelling downs, where sweet air stirs</a>
<a id='line_285'>  Blue hare-bells lightly, and where prickly furze</a>
<a id='line_286'>  Buds lavish gold; or ye, whose precious charge</a>
<a id='line_287'>  Nibble their fill at ocean's very marge,</a>
<a id='line_288'>  Whose mellow reeds are touch'd with sounds forlorn</a>
<a id='line_289'>  By the dim echoes of old Triton's horn:</a>
<a id='line_290'>  Mothers and wives! who day by day prepare</a>
<a id='line_291'>  The scrip, with needments, for the mountain air;</a>
<a id='line_292'>  And all ye gentle girls who foster up</a>
<a id='line_293'>  Udderless lambs, and in a little cup                          210</a>
<a id='line_294'>  Will put choice honey for a favoured youth:</a>
<a id='line_295'>  Yea, every one attend! for in good truth</a>
<a id='line_296'>  Our vows are wanting to our great god Pan.</a>
<a id='line_297'>  Are not our lowing heifers sleeker than</a>
<a id='line_298'>  Night-swollen mushrooms? Are not our wide plains</a>
<a id='line_299'>  Speckled with countless fleeces? Have not rains</a>
<a id='line_300'>  Green'd over April's lap? No howling sad</a>
<a id='line_301'>  Sickens our fearful ewes; and we have had</a>
<a id='line_302'>  Great bounty from Endymion our lord.</a>
<a id='line_303'>  The earth is glad: the merry lark has pour'd                  220</a>
<a id='line_304'>  His early song against yon breezy sky,</a>
<a id='line_305'>  That spreads so clear o'er our solemnity."</a>
<a id='line_306'></a>
<a id='line_307'>    Thus ending, on the shrine he heap'd a spire</a>
<a id='line_308'>  Of teeming sweets, enkindling sacred fire;</a>
<a id='line_309'>  Anon he stain'd the thick and spongy sod</a>

<a id='line_411'>  Time's sweet first-fruits--they danc'd to weariness,</a>
<a id='line_412'>  And then in quiet circles did they press</a>
<a id='line_413'>  The hillock turf, and caught the latter end</a>
<a id='line_414'>  Of some strange history, potent to send</a>
<a id='line_415'>  A young mind from its bodily tenement.</a>
<a id='line_416'>  Or they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent</a>
<a id='line_417'>  On either side; pitying the sad death</a>
<a id='line_418'>  Of Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath</a>

<a id='line_420'>  Who now, ere PhÅbus mounts the firmament,                     330</a>
<a id='line_421'>  Fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain.</a>
<a id='line_422'>  The archers too, upon a wider plain,</a>
<a id='line_423'>  Beside the feathery whizzing of the shaft,</a>
<a id='line_424'>  And the dull twanging bowstring, and the raft</a>
<a id='line_425'>  Branch down sweeping from a tall ash top,</a>
<a id='line_426'>  Call'd up a thousand thoughts to envelope</a>
<a id='line_427'>  Those who would watch. Perhaps, the trembling knee</a>
<a id='line_428'>  And frantic gape of lonely Niobe,</a>
<a id='line_429'>  Poor, lonely Niobe! when her lovely young</a>
<a id='line_430'>  Were dead and gone, and her caressing tongue                  340</a>
<a id='line_431'>  Lay a lost thing upon her paly lip,</a>
<a id='line_432'>  And very, very deadliness did nip</a>
<a id='line_433'>  Her motherly cheeks. Arous'd from this sad mood</a>
<a id='line_434'>  By one, who at a distance loud halloo'd,</a>
<a id='line_435'>  Uplifting his strong bow into the air,</a>
<a id='line_436'>  Many might after brighter visions stare:</a>
<a id='line_437'>  After the Argonauts, in blind amaze</a>
<a id='line_438'>  Tossing about on Neptune's restless ways,</a>
<a id='line_439'>  Until, from the horizon's vaulted side,</a>
<a id='line_440'>  There shot a golden splendour far and wide,                   350</a>
<a id='line_441'>  Spangling those million poutings of the brine</a>
<a id='line_442'>  With quivering ore: 'twas even an awful shine</a>
<a id='line_443'>  From the exaltation of Apollo's bow;</a>
<a id='line_444'>  A heavenly beacon in their dreary woe.</a>
<a id='line_445'>  Who thus were ripe for high contemplating,</a>
<a id='line_446'>  Might turn their steps towards the sober ring</a>
<a id='line_447'>  Where sat Endymion and the aged priest</a>
<a id='line_448'>  'Mong shepherds gone in eld, whose looks increas'd</a>
<a id='line_449'>  The silvery setting of their mortal star.</a>
<a id='line_450'>  There they discours'd upon the fragile bar                    360</a>
<a id='line_451'>  That keeps us from our homes ethereal;</a>
<a id='line_452'>  And what our duties there: to nightly call</a>
<a id='line_453'>  Vesper, the beauty-crest of summer weather;</a>
<a id='line_454'>  To summon all the downiest clouds together</a>
<a id='line_455'>  For the sun's purple couch; to emulate</a>
<a id='line_456'>  In ministring the potent rule of fate</a>
<a id='line_457'>  With speed of fire-tailed exhalations;</a>
<a id='line_458'>  To tint her pallid cheek with bloom, who cons</a>
<a id='line_459'>  Sweet poesy by moonlight: besides these,</a>
<a id='line_460'>  A world of other unguess'd offices.                           370</a>
<a id='line_461'>  Anon they wander'd, by divine converse,</a>
<a id='line_462'>  Into Elysium; vieing to rehearse</a>
<a id='line_463'>  Each one his own anticipated bliss.</a>
<a id='line_464'>  One felt heart-certain that he could not miss</a>
<a id='line_465'>  His quick gone love, among fair blossom'd boughs,</a>
<a id='line_466'>  Where every zephyr-sigh pouts, and endows</a>
<a id='line_467'>  Her lips with music for the welcoming.</a>
<a id='line_468'>  Another wish'd, mid that eternal spring,</a>
<a id='line_469'>  To meet his rosy child, with feathery sails,</a>
<a id='line_470'>  Sweeping, eye-earnestly, through almond vales:                380</a>
<a id='line_471'>  Who, suddenly, should stoop through the smooth wind,</a>
<a id='line_472'>  And with the balmiest leaves his temples bind;</a>
<a id='line_473'>  And, ever after, through those regions be</a>
<a id='line_474'>  His messenger, his little Mercury,</a>
<a id='line_475'>  Some were athirst in soul to see again</a>
<a id='line_476'>  Their fellow huntsmen o'er the wide champaign</a>
<a id='line_477'>  In times long past; to sit with them, and talk</a>
<a id='line_478'>  Of all the chances in their earthly walk;</a>
<a id='line_479'>  Comparing, joyfully, their plenteous stores</a>
<a id='line_480'>  Of happiness, to when upon the moors,                         390</a>
<a id='line_481'>  Benighted, close they huddled from the cold,</a>
<a id='line_482'>  And shar'd their famish'd scrips. Thus all out-told</a>
<a id='line_483'>  Their fond imaginations,--saving him</a>
<a id='line_484'>  Whose eyelids curtain'd up their jewels dim,</a>
<a id='line_485'>  Endymion: yet hourly had he striven</a>
<a id='line_486'>  To hide the cankering venom, that had riven</a>
<a id='line_487'>  His fainting recollections. Now indeed</a>
<a id='line_488'>  His senses had swoon'd off: he did not heed</a>
<a id='line_489'>  The sudden silence, or the whispers low,</a>
<a id='line_490'>  Or the old eyes dissolving at his woe,                        400</a>
<a id='line_491'>  Or anxious calls, or close of trembling palms,</a>
<a id='line_492'>  Or maiden's sigh, that grief itself embalms:</a>
<a id='line_493'>  But in the self-same fixed trance he kept,</a>
<a id='line_494'>  Like one who on the earth had never slept.</a>
<a id='line_495'>  Aye, even as dead-still as a marble man,</a>
<a id='line_496'>  Frozen in that old tale Arabian.</a>
<a id='line_497'></a>
<a id='line_498'>    Who whispers him so pantingly and close?</a>
<a id='line_499'>  Peona, his sweet sister: of all those,</a>
<a id='line_500'>  His friends, the dearest. Hushing signs she made,</a>
<a id='line_501'>  And breath'd a sister's sorrow to persuade                    410</a>
<a id='line_502'>  A yielding up, a cradling on her care.</a>
<a id='line_503'>  Her eloquence did breathe away the curse:</a>
<a id='line_504'>  She led him, like some midnight spirit nurse</a>
<a id='line_505'>  Of happy changes in emphatic dreams,</a>
<a id='line_506'>  Along a path between two little streams,--</a>
<a id='line_507'>  Guarding his forehead, with her round elbow,</a>
<a id='line_508'>  From low-grown branches, and his footsteps slow</a>
<a id='line_509'>  From stumbling over stumps and hillocks small;</a>
<a id='line_510'>  Until they came to where these streamlets fall,</a>
<a id='line_511'>  With mingled bubblings and a gentle rush,                     420</a>
<a id='line_512'>  Into a river, clear, brimful, and flush</a>
<a id='line_513'>  With crystal mocking of the trees and sky.</a>
<a id='line_514'>  A little shallop, floating there hard by,</a>
<a id='line_515'>  Pointed its beak over the fringed bank;</a>
<a id='line_516'>  And soon it lightly dipt, and rose, and sank,</a>
<a id='line_517'>  And dipt again, with the young couple's weight,--</a>
<a id='line_518'>  Peona guiding, through the water straight,</a>
<a id='line_519'>  Towards a bowery island opposite;</a>
<a id='line_520'>  Which gaining presently, she steered light</a>
<a id='line_521'>  Into a shady, fresh, and ripply cove,                         430</a>
<a id='line_522'>  Where nested was an arbour, overwove</a>
<a id='line_523'>  By many a summer's silent fingering;</a>
<a id='line_524'>  To whose cool bosom she was used to bring</a>
<a id='line_525'>  Her playmates, with their needle broidery,</a>
<a id='line_526'>  And minstrel memories of times gone by.</a>
<a id='line_527'></a>
<a id='line_528'>    So she was gently glad to see him laid</a>
<a id='line_529'>  Under her favourite bower's quiet shade,</a>
<a id='line_530'>  On her own couch, new made of flower leaves,</a>
<a id='line_531'>  Dried carefully on the cooler side of sheaves</a>
<a id='line_532'>  When last the sun his autumn tresses shook,                   440</a>
<a id='line_533'>  And the tann'd harvesters rich armfuls took.</a>
<a id='line_534'>  Soon was he quieted to slumbrous rest:</a>
<a id='line_535'>  But, ere it crept upon him, he had prest</a>
<a id='line_536'>  Peona's busy hand against his lips,</a>
<a id='line_537'>  And still, a sleeping, held her finger-tips</a>
<a id='line_538'>  In tender pressure. And as a willow keeps</a>
<a id='line_539'>  A patient watch over the stream that creeps</a>
<a id='line_540'>  Windingly by it, so the quiet maid</a>
<a id='line_541'>  Held her in peace: so that a whispering blade</a>
<a id='line_542'>  Of grass, a wailful gnat, a bee bustling                      450</a>
<a id='line_543'>  Down in the blue-bells, or a wren light rustling</a>
<a id='line_544'>  Among sere leaves and twigs, might all be heard.</a>
<a id='line_545'></a>
<a id='line_546'>    O magic sleep! O comfortable bird,</a>
<a id='line_547'>  That broodest o'er the troubled sea of the mind</a>
<a id='line_548'>  Till it is hush'd and smooth! O unconfin'd</a>
<a id='line_549'>  Restraint! imprisoned liberty! great key</a>
<a id='line_550'>  To golden palaces, strange minstrelsy,</a>
<a id='line_551'>  Fountains grotesque, new trees, bespangled caves,</a>
<a id='line_552'>  Echoing grottos, full of tumbling waves</a>
<a id='line_553'>  And moonlight; aye, to all the mazy world                     460</a>
<a id='line_554'>  Of silvery enchantment!--who, upfurl'd</a>
<a id='line_555'>  Beneath thy drowsy wing a triple hour,</a>
<a id='line_556'>  But renovates and lives?--Thus, in the bower,</a>
<a id='line_557'>  Endymion was calm'd to life again.</a>
<a id='line_558'>  Opening his eyelids with a healthier brain,</a>
<a id='line_559'>  He said: "I feel this thine endearing love</a>
<a id='line_560'>  All through my bosom: thou art as a dove</a>
<a id='line_561'>  Trembling its closed eyes and sleeked wings</a>
<a id='line_562'>  About me; and the pearliest dew not brings</a>
<a id='line_563'>  Such morning incense from the fields of May,                  470</a>
<a id='line_564'>  As do those brighter drops that twinkling stray</a>
<a id='line_565'>  From those kind eyes,--the very home and haunt</a>
<a id='line_566'>  Of sisterly affection. Can I want</a>
<a id='line_567'>  Aught else, aught nearer heaven, than such tears?</a>
<a id='line_568'>  Yet dry them up, in bidding hence all fears</a>
<a id='line_569'>  That, any longer, I will pass my days</a>
<a id='line_570'>  Alone and sad. No, I will once more raise</a>
<a id='line_571'>  My voice upon the mountain-heights; once more</a>
<a id='line_572'>  Make my horn parley from their foreheads hoar:</a>
<a id='line_573'>  Again my trooping hounds their tongues shall loll             480</a>
<a id='line_574'>  Around the breathed boar: again I'll poll</a>
<a id='line_575'>  The fair-grown yew tree, for a chosen bow:</a>
<a id='line_576'>  And, when the pleasant sun is getting low,</a>
<a id='line_577'>  Again I'll linger in a sloping mead</a>
<a id='line_578'>  To hear the speckled thrushes, and see feed</a>
<a id='line_579'>  Our idle sheep. So be thou cheered sweet,</a>
<a id='line_580'>  And, if thy lute is here, softly intreat</a>
<a id='line_581'>  My soul to keep in its resolved course."</a>
<a id='line_582'></a>
<a id='line_583'>    Hereat Peona, in their silver source,</a>
<a id='line_584'>  Shut her pure sorrow drops with glad exclaim,                 490</a>
<a id='line_585'>  And took a lute, from which there pulsing came</a>
<a id='line_586'>  A lively prelude, fashioning the way</a>
<a id='line_587'>  In which her voice should wander. 'Twas a lay</a>
<a id='line_588'>  More subtle cadenced, more forest wild</a>
<a id='line_589'>  Than Dryope's lone lulling of her child;</a>
<a id='line_590'>  And nothing since has floated in the air</a>
<a id='line_591'>  So mournful strange. Surely some influence rare</a>
<a id='line_592'>  Went, spiritual, through the damsel's hand;</a>
<a id='line_593'>  For still, with Delphic emphasis, she spann'd</a>
<a id='line_594'>  The quick invisible strings, even though she saw              500</a>
<a id='line_595'>  Endymion's spirit melt away and thaw</a>
<a id='line_596'>  Before the deep intoxication.</a>
<a id='line_597'>  But soon she came, with sudden burst, upon</a>
<a id='line_598'>  Her self-possession--swung the lute aside,</a>
<a id='line_599'>  And earnestly said: "Brother, 'tis vain to hide</a>
<a id='line_600'>  That thou dost know of things mysterious,</a>
<a id='line_601'>  Immortal, starry; such alone could thus</a>
<a id='line_602'>  Weigh down thy nature. Hast thou sinn'd in aught</a>
<a id='line_603'>  Offensive to the heavenly powers? Caught</a>
<a id='line_604'>  A Paphian dove upon a message sent?                           510</a>
<a id='line_605'>  Thy deathful bow against some deer-herd bent,</a>
<a id='line_606'>  Sacred to Dian? Haply, thou hast seen</a>
<a id='line_607'>  Her naked limbs among the alders green;</a>
<a id='line_608'>  And that, alas! is death. No, I can trace</a>
<a id='line_609'>  Something more high perplexing in thy face!"</a>
<a id='line_610'></a>
<a id='line_611'>    Endymion look'd at her, and press'd her hand,</a>
<a id='line_612'>  And said, "Art thou so pale, who wast so bland</a>
<a id='line_613'>  And merry in our meadows? How is this?</a>
<a id='line_614'>  Tell me thine ailment: tell me all amiss!--</a>
<a id='line_615'>  Ah! thou hast been unhappy at the change                      520</a>
<a id='line_616'>  Wrought suddenly in me. What indeed more strange?</a>
<a id='line_617'>  Or more complete to overwhelm surmise?</a>
<a id='line_618'>  Ambition is no sluggard: 'tis no prize,</a>
<a id='line_619'>  That toiling years would put within my grasp,</a>
<a id='line_620'>  That I have sigh'd for: with so deadly gasp</a>
<a id='line_621'>  No man e'er panted for a mortal love.</a>
<a id='line_622'>  So all have set my heavier grief above</a>
<a id='line_623'>  These things which happen. Rightly have they done:</a>
<a id='line_624'>  I, who still saw the horizontal sun</a>
<a id='line_625'>  Heave his broad shoulder o'er the edge of the world,          530</a>
<a id='line_626'>  Out-facing Lucifer, and then had hurl'd</a>
<a id='line_627'>  My spear aloft, as signal for the chace--</a>
<a id='line_628'>  I, who, for very sport of heart, would race</a>
<a id='line_629'>  With my own steed from Araby; pluck down</a>
<a id='line_630'>  A vulture from his towery perching; frown</a>
<a id='line_631'>  A lion into growling, loth retire--</a>
<a id='line_632'>  To lose, at once, all my toil breeding fire,</a>
<a id='line_633'>  And sink thus low! but I will ease my breast</a>
<a id='line_634'>  Of secret grief, here in this bowery nest.</a>
<a id='line_635'></a>
<a id='line_636'>    "This river does not see the naked sky,                     540</a>
<a id='line_637'>  Till it begins to progress silverly</a>
<a id='line_638'>  Around the western border of the wood,</a>
<a id='line_639'>  Whence, from a certain spot, its winding flood</a>
<a id='line_640'>  Seems at the distance like a crescent moon:</a>
<a id='line_641'>  And in that nook, the very pride of June,</a>
<a id='line_642'>  Had I been used to pass my weary eves;</a>
<a id='line_643'>  The rather for the sun unwilling leaves</a>
<a id='line_644'>  So dear a picture of his sovereign power,</a>
<a id='line_645'>  And I could witness his most kingly hour,</a>
<a id='line_646'>  When he doth lighten up the golden reins,                     550</a>
<a id='line_647'>  And paces leisurely down amber plains</a>
<a id='line_648'>  His snorting four. Now when his chariot last</a>
<a id='line_649'>  Its beams against the zodiac-lion cast,</a>
<a id='line_650'>  There blossom'd suddenly a magic bed</a>
<a id='line_651'>  Of sacred ditamy, and poppies red:</a>
<a id='line_652'>  At which I wondered greatly, knowing well</a>
<a id='line_653'>  That but one night had wrought this flowery spell;</a>
<a id='line_654'>  And, sitting down close by, began to muse</a>
<a id='line_655'>  What it might mean. Perhaps, thought I, Morpheus,</a>
<a id='line_656'>  In passing here, his owlet pinions shook;                     560</a>
<a id='line_657'>  Or, it may be, ere matron Night uptook</a>
<a id='line_658'>  Her ebon urn, young Mercury, by stealth,</a>
<a id='line_659'>  Had dipt his rod in it: such garland wealth</a>
<a id='line_660'>  Came not by common growth. Thus on I thought,</a>
<a id='line_661'>  Until my head was dizzy and distraught.</a>
<a id='line_662'>  Moreover, through the dancing poppies stole</a>
<a id='line_663'>  A breeze, most softly lulling to my soul;</a>
<a id='line_664'>  And shaping visions all about my sight</a>
<a id='line_665'>  Of colours, wings, and bursts of spangly light;</a>
<a id='line_666'>  The which became more strange, and strange, and dim,</a>
<a id='line_667'>  And then were gulph'd in a tumultuous swim:                   571</a>
<a id='line_668'>  And then I fell asleep. Ah, can I tell</a>
<a id='line_669'>  The enchantment that afterwards befel?</a>
<a id='line_670'>  Yet it was but a dream: yet such a dream</a>
<a id='line_671'>  That never tongue, although it overteem</a>
<a id='line_672'>  With mellow utterance, like a cavern spring,</a>
<a id='line_673'>  Could figure out and to conception bring</a>
<a id='line_674'>  All I beheld and felt. Methought I lay</a>
<a id='line_675'>  Watching the zenith, where the milky way</a>
<a id='line_676'>  Among the stars in virgin splendour pours;                    580</a>
<a id='line_677'>  And travelling my eye, until the doors</a>
<a id='line_678'>  Of heaven appear'd to open for my flight,</a>
<a id='line_679'>  I became loth and fearful to alight</a>
<a id='line_680'>  From such high soaring by a downward glance:</a>
<a id='line_681'>  So kept me stedfast in that airy trance,</a>
<a id='line_682'>  Spreading imaginary pinions wide.</a>
<a id='line_683'>  When, presently, the stars began to glide,</a>
<a id='line_684'>  And faint away, before my eager view:</a>
<a id='line_685'>  At which I sigh'd that I could not pursue,</a>
<a id='line_686'>  And dropt my vision to the horizon's verge;                   590</a>
<a id='line_687'>  And lo! from opening clouds, I saw emerge</a>
<a id='line_688'>  The loveliest moon, that ever silver'd o'er</a>
<a id='line_689'>  A shell for Neptune's goblet: she did soar</a>
<a id='line_690'>  So passionately bright, my dazzled soul</a>
<a id='line_691'>  Commingling with her argent spheres did roll</a>
<a id='line_692'>  Through clear and cloudy, even when she went</a>
<a id='line_693'>  At last into a dark and vapoury tent--</a>
<a id='line_694'>  Whereat, methought, the lidless-eyed train</a>
<a id='line_695'>  Of planets all were in the blue again.</a>
<a id='line_696'>  To commune with those orbs, once more I rais'd                600</a>
<a id='line_697'>  My sight right upward: but it was quite dazed</a>
<a id='line_698'>  By a bright something, sailing down apace,</a>
<a id='line_699'>  Making me quickly veil my eyes and face:</a>
<a id='line_700'>  Again I look'd, and, O ye deities,</a>
<a id='line_701'>  Who from Olympus watch our destinies!</a>
<a id='line_702'>  Whence that completed form of all completeness?</a>
<a id='line_703'>  Whence came that high perfection of all sweetness?</a>
<a id='line_704'>  Speak, stubborn earth, and tell me where, O where</a>
<a id='line_705'>  Hast thou a symbol of her golden hair?</a>
<a id='line_706'>  Not oat-sheaves drooping in the western sun;                  610</a>
<a id='line_707'>  Not--thy soft hand, fair sister! let me shun</a>
<a id='line_708'>  Such follying before thee--yet she had,</a>
<a id='line_709'>  Indeed, locks bright enough to make me mad;</a>
<a id='line_710'>  And they were simply gordian'd up and braided,</a>
<a id='line_711'>  Leaving, in naked comeliness, unshaded,</a>
<a id='line_712'>  Her pearl round ears, white neck, and orbed brow;</a>
<a id='line_713'>  The which were blended in, I know not how,</a>
<a id='line_714'>  With such a paradise of lips and eyes,</a>
<a id='line_715'>  Blush-tinted cheeks, half smiles, and faintest sighs,</a>
<a id='line_716'>  That, when I think thereon, my spirit clings                  620</a>
<a id='line_717'>  And plays about its fancy, till the stings</a>
<a id='line_718'>  Of human neighbourhood envenom all.</a>
<a id='line_719'>  Unto what awful power shall I call?</a>
<a id='line_720'>  To what high fane?--Ah! see her hovering feet,</a>
<a id='line_721'>  More bluely vein'd, more soft, more whitely sweet</a>
<a id='line_722'>  Than those of sea-born Venus, when she rose</a>
<a id='line_723'>  From out her cradle shell. The wind out-blows</a>
<a id='line_724'>  Her scarf into a fluttering pavilion;</a>
<a id='line_725'>  'Tis blue, and over-spangled with a million</a>
<a id='line_726'>  Of little eyes, as though thou wert to shed,                  630</a>
<a id='line_727'>  Over the darkest, lushest blue-bell bed,</a>
<a id='line_728'>  Handfuls of daisies."--"Endymion, how strange!</a>
<a id='line_729'>  Dream within dream!"--"She took an airy range,</a>
<a id='line_730'>  And then, towards me, like a very maid,</a>
<a id='line_731'>  Came blushing, waning, willing, and afraid,</a>
<a id='line_732'>  And press'd me by the hand: Ah! 'twas too much;</a>
<a id='line_733'>  Methought I fainted at the charmed touch,</a>
<a id='line_734'>  Yet held my recollection, even as one</a>
<a id='line_735'>  Who dives three fathoms where the waters run</a>
<a id='line_736'>  Gurgling in beds of coral: for anon,                          640</a>
<a id='line_737'>  I felt upmounted in that region</a>
<a id='line_738'>  Where falling stars dart their artillery forth,</a>
<a id='line_739'>  And eagles struggle with the buffeting north</a>
<a id='line_740'>  That balances the heavy meteor-stone;--</a>
<a id='line_741'>  Felt too, I was not fearful, nor alone,</a>
<a id='line_742'>  But lapp'd and lull'd along the dangerous sky.</a>
<a id='line_743'>  Soon, as it seem'd, we left our journeying high,</a>
<a id='line_744'>  And straightway into frightful eddies swoop'd;</a>
<a id='line_745'>  Such as ay muster where grey time has scoop'd</a>
<a id='line_746'>  Huge dens and caverns in a mountain's side:                   650</a>
<a id='line_747'>  There hollow sounds arous'd me, and I sigh'd</a>
<a id='line_748'>  To faint once more by looking on my bliss--</a>
<a id='line_749'>  I was distracted; madly did I kiss</a>
<a id='line_750'>  The wooing arms which held me, and did give</a>
<a id='line_751'>  My eyes at once to death: but 'twas to live,</a>
<a id='line_752'>  To take in draughts of life from the gold fount</a>
<a id='line_753'>  Of kind and passionate looks; to count, and count</a>
<a id='line_754'>  The moments, by some greedy help that seem'd</a>
<a id='line_755'>  A second self, that each might be redeem'd</a>
<a id='line_756'>  And plunder'd of its load of blessedness.                     660</a>
<a id='line_757'>  Ah, desperate mortal! I ev'n dar'd to press</a>
<a id='line_758'>  Her very cheek against my crowned lip,</a>
<a id='line_759'>  And, at that moment, felt my body dip</a>
<a id='line_760'>  Into a warmer air: a moment more,</a>
<a id='line_761'>  Our feet were soft in flowers. There was store</a>
<a id='line_762'>  Of newest joys upon that alp. Sometimes</a>
<a id='line_763'>  A scent of violets, and blossoming limes,</a>
<a id='line_764'>  Loiter'd around us; then of honey cells,</a>
<a id='line_765'>  Made delicate from all white-flower bells;</a>
<a id='line_766'>  And once, above the edges of our nest,                        670</a>
<a id='line_767'>  An arch face peep'd,--an Oread as I guess'd.</a>
<a id='line_768'></a>
<a id='line_769'>    "Why did I dream that sleep o'er-power'd me</a>
<a id='line_770'>  In midst of all this heaven? Why not see,</a>
<a id='line_771'>  Far off, the shadows of his pinions dark,</a>
<a id='line_772'>  And stare them from me? But no, like a spark</a>
<a id='line_773'>  That needs must die, although its little beam</a>
<a id='line_774'>  Reflects upon a diamond, my sweet dream</a>
<a id='line_775'>  Fell into nothing--into stupid sleep.</a>
<a id='line_776'>  And so it was, until a gentle creep,</a>
<a id='line_777'>  A careful moving caught my waking ears,                       680</a>
<a id='line_778'>  And up I started: Ah! my sighs, my tears,</a>
<a id='line_779'>  My clenched hands;--for lo! the poppies hung</a>
<a id='line_780'>  Dew-dabbled on their stalks, the ouzel sung</a>
<a id='line_781'>  A heavy ditty, and the sullen day</a>
<a id='line_782'>  Had chidden herald Hesperus away,</a>
<a id='line_783'>  With leaden looks: the solitary breeze</a>
<a id='line_784'>  Bluster'd, and slept, and its wild self did teaze</a>
<a id='line_785'>  With wayward melancholy; and I thought,</a>
<a id='line_786'>  Mark me, Peona! that sometimes it brought</a>
<a id='line_787'>  Faint fare-thee-wells, and sigh-shrilled adieus!--            690</a>
<a id='line_788'>  Away I wander'd--all the pleasant hues</a>
<a id='line_789'>  Of heaven and earth had faded: deepest shades</a>
<a id='line_790'>  Were deepest dungeons; heaths and sunny glades</a>
<a id='line_791'>  Were full of pestilent light; our taintless rills</a>
<a id='line_792'>  Seem'd sooty, and o'er-spread with upturn'd gills</a>
<a id='line_793'>  Of dying fish; the vermeil rose had blown</a>
<a id='line_794'>  In frightful scarlet, and its thorns out-grown</a>
<a id='line_795'>  Like spiked aloe. If an innocent bird</a>
<a id='line_796'>  Before my heedless footsteps stirr'd, and stirr'd</a>
<a id='line_797'>  In little journeys, I beheld in it                            700</a>
<a id='line_798'>  A disguis'd demon, missioned to knit</a>
<a id='line_799'>  My soul with under darkness; to entice</a>
<a id='line_800'>  My stumblings down some monstrous precipice:</a>
<a id='line_801'>  Therefore I eager followed, and did curse</a>
<a id='line_802'>  The disappointment. Time, that aged nurse,</a>
<a id='line_803'>  Rock'd me to patience. Now, thank gentle heaven!</a>
<a id='line_804'>  These things, with all their comfortings, are given</a>
<a id='line_805'>  To my down-sunken hours, and with thee,</a>
<a id='line_806'>  Sweet sister, help to stem the ebbing sea</a>
<a id='line_807'>  Of weary life."                                               710</a>
<a id='line_808'></a>
<a id='line_809'>                   Thus ended he, and both</a>
<a id='line_810'>  Sat silent: for the maid was very loth</a>
<a id='line_811'>  To answer; feeling well that breathed words</a>
<a id='line_812'>  Would all be lost, unheard, and vain as swords</a>
<a id='line_813'>  Against the enchased crocodile, or leaps</a>
<a id='line_814'>  Of grasshoppers against the sun. She weeps,</a>
<a id='line_815'>  And wonders; struggles to devise some blame;</a>
<a id='line_816'>  To put on such a look as would say, _Shame</a>
<a id='line_817'>  On this poor weakness!_ but, for all her strife,</a>
<a id='line_818'>  She could as soon have crush'd away the life                  720</a>
<a id='line_819'>  From a sick dove. At length, to break the pause,</a>
<a id='line_820'>  She said with trembling chance: "Is this the cause?</a>
<a id='line_821'>  This all? Yet it is strange, and sad, alas!</a>
<a id='line_822'>  That one who through this middle earth should pass</a>
<a id='line_823'>  Most like a sojourning demi-god, and leave</a>
<a id='line_824'>  His name upon the harp-string, should achieve</a>
<a id='line_825'>  No higher bard than simple maidenhood,</a>
<a id='line_826'>  Singing alone, and fearfully,--how the blood</a>
<a id='line_827'>  Left his young cheek; and how he used to stray</a>
<a id='line_828'>  He knew not where; and how he would say, _nay_,               730</a>
<a id='line_829'>  If any said 'twas love: and yet 'twas love;</a>
<a id='line_830'>  What could it be but love? How a ring-dove</a>
<a id='line_831'>  Let fall a sprig of yew tree in his path;</a>
<a id='line_832'>  And how he died: and then, that love doth scathe,</a>
<a id='line_833'>  The gentle heart, as northern blasts do roses;</a>
<a id='line_834'>  And then the ballad of his sad life closes</a>
<a id='line_835'>  With sighs, and an alas!--Endymion!</a>
<a id='line_836'>  Be rather in the trumpet's mouth,--anon</a>
<a id='line_837'>  Among the winds at large--that all may hearken!</a>
<a id='line_838'>  Although, before the crystal heavens darken,                  740</a>
<a id='line_839'>  I watch and dote upon the silver lakes</a>
<a id='line_840'>  Pictur'd in western cloudiness, that takes</a>
<a id='line_841'>  The semblance of gold rocks and bright gold sands,</a>
<a id='line_842'>  Islands, and creeks, and amber-fretted strands</a>
<a id='line_843'>  With horses prancing o'er them, palaces</a>
<a id='line_844'>  And towers of amethyst,--would I so tease</a>
<a id='line_845'>  My pleasant days, because I could not mount</a>
<a id='line_846'>  Into those regions? The Morphean fount</a>
<a id='line_847'>  Of that fine element that visions, dreams,</a>
<a id='line_848'>  And fitful whims of sleep are made of, streams                750</a>
<a id='line_849'>  Into its airy channels with so subtle,</a>
<a id='line_850'>  So thin a breathing, not the spider's shuttle,</a>
<a id='line_851'>  Circled a million times within the space</a>
<a id='line_852'>  Of a swallow's nest-door, could delay a trace,</a>
<a id='line_853'>  A tinting of its quality: how light</a>
<a id='line_854'>  Must dreams themselves be; seeing they're more slight</a>
<a id='line_855'>  Than the mere nothing that engenders them!</a>
<a id='line_856'>  Then wherefore sully the entrusted gem</a>
<a id='line_857'>  Of high and noble life with thoughts so sick?</a>
<a id='line_858'>  Why pierce high-fronted honour to the quick                   760</a>
<a id='line_859'>  For nothing but a dream?" Hereat the youth</a>
<a id='line_860'>  Look'd up: a conflicting of shame and ruth</a>
<a id='line_861'>  Was in his plaited brow: yet, his eyelids</a>
<a id='line_862'>  Widened a little, as when Zephyr bids</a>
<a id='line_863'>  A little breeze to creep between the fans</a>
<a id='line_864'>  Of careless butterflies: amid his pains</a>
<a id='line_865'>  He seem'd to taste a drop of manna-dew,</a>
<a id='line_866'>  Full palatable; and a colour grew</a>
<a id='line_867'>  Upon his cheek, while thus he lifeful spake.</a>
<a id='line_868'></a>
<a id='line_869'>    "Peona! ever have I long'd to slake                         770</a>
<a id='line_870'>  My thirst for the world's praises: nothing base,</a>
<a id='line_871'>  No merely slumberous phantasm, could unlace</a>
<a id='line_872'>  The stubborn canvas for my voyage prepar'd--</a>
<a id='line_873'>  Though now 'tis tatter'd; leaving my bark bar'd</a>
<a id='line_874'>  And sullenly drifting: yet my higher hope</a>
<a id='line_875'>  Is of too wide, too rainbow-large a scope,</a>
<a id='line_876'>  To fret at myriads of earthly wrecks.</a>
<a id='line_877'>  Wherein lies happiness? In that which becks</a>
<a id='line_878'>  Our ready minds to fellowship divine,</a>
<a id='line_879'>  A fellowship with essence; till we shine,                     780</a>
<a id='line_880'>  Full alchemiz'd, and free of space. Behold</a>
<a id='line_881'>  The clear religion of heaven! Fold</a>
<a id='line_882'>  A rose leaf round thy finger's taperness,</a>
<a id='line_883'>  And soothe thy lips: hist, when the airy stress</a>
<a id='line_884'>  Of music's kiss impregnates the free winds,</a>
<a id='line_885'>  And with a sympathetic touch unbinds</a>
<a id='line_886'>  Eolian magic from their lucid wombs:</a>
<a id='line_887'>  Then old songs waken from enclouded tombs;</a>
<a id='line_888'>  Old ditties sigh above their father's grave;</a>
<a id='line_889'>  Ghosts of melodious prophecyings rave                         790</a>
<a id='line_890'>  Round every spot were trod Apollo's foot;</a>
<a id='line_891'>  Bronze clarions awake, and faintly bruit,</a>
<a id='line_892'>  Where long ago a giant battle was;</a>
<a id='line_893'>  And, from the turf, a lullaby doth pass</a>
<a id='line_894'>  In every place where infant Orpheus slept.</a>
<a id='line_895'>  Feel we these things?--that moment have we stept</a>
<a id='line_896'>  Into a sort of oneness, and our state</a>
<a id='line_897'>  Is like a floating spirit's. But there are</a>

<a id='line_899'>  More self-destroying, leading, by degrees,                    800</a>
<a id='line_900'>  To the chief intensity: the crown of these</a>
<a id='line_901'>  Is made of love and friendship, and sits high</a>
<a id='line_902'>  Upon the forehead of humanity.</a>
<a id='line_903'>  All its more ponderous and bulky worth</a>
<a id='line_904'>  Is friendship, whence there ever issues forth</a>
<a id='line_905'>  A steady splendour; but at the tip-top,</a>
<a id='line_906'>  There hangs by unseen film, an orbed drop</a>
<a id='line_907'>  Of light, and that is love: its influence,</a>
<a id='line_908'>  Thrown in our eyes, genders a novel sense,</a>
<a id='line_909'>  At which we start and fret; till in the end,                  810</a>
<a id='line_910'>  Melting into its radiance, we blend,</a>
<a id='line_911'>  Mingle, and so become a part of it,--</a>
<a id='line_912'>  Nor with aught else can our souls interknit</a>
<a id='line_913'>  So wingedly: when we combine therewith,</a>
<a id='line_914'>  Life's self is nourish'd by its proper pith,</a>
<a id='line_915'>  And we are nurtured like a pelican brood.</a>
<a id='line_916'>  Aye, so delicious is the unsating food,</a>
<a id='line_917'>  That men, who might have tower'd in the van</a>
<a id='line_918'>  Of all the congregated world, to fan</a>
<a id='line_919'>  And winnow from the coming step of time                       820</a>
<a id='line_920'>  All chaff of custom, wipe away all slime</a>
<a id='line_921'>  Left by men-slugs and human serpentry,</a>
<a id='line_922'>  Have been content to let occasion die,</a>
<a id='line_923'>  Whilst they did sleep in love's elysium.</a>
<a id='line_924'>  And, truly, I would rather be struck dumb,</a>
<a id='line_925'>  Than speak against this ardent listlessness:</a>
<a id='line_926'>  For I have ever thought that it might bless</a>
<a id='line_927'>  The world with benefits unknowingly;</a>
<a id='line_928'>  As does the nightingale, upperched high,</a>
<a id='line_929'>  And cloister'd among cool and bunched leaves--                830</a>
<a id='line_930'>  She sings but to her love, nor e'er conceives</a>
<a id='line_931'>  How tiptoe Night holds back her dark-grey hood.</a>
<a id='line_932'>  Just so may love, although 'tis understood</a>
<a id='line_933'>  The mere commingling of passionate breath,</a>
<a id='line_934'>  Produce more than our searching witnesseth:</a>
<a id='line_935'>  What I know not: but who, of men, can tell</a>
<a id='line_936'>  That flowers would bloom, or that green fruit would swell</a>
<a id='line_937'>  To melting pulp, that fish would have bright mail,</a>
<a id='line_938'>  The earth its dower of river, wood, and vale,</a>
<a id='line_939'>  The meadows runnels, runnels pebble-stones,                   840</a>
<a id='line_940'>  The seed its harvest, or the lute its tones,</a>
<a id='line_941'>  Tones ravishment, or ravishment its sweet,</a>
<a id='line_942'>  If human souls did never kiss and greet?</a>
<a id='line_943'></a>
<a id='line_944'>    "Now, if this earthly love has power to make</a>

<a id='line_947'>  Their measure of content; what merest whim,</a>
<a id='line_948'>  Seems all this poor endeavour after fame,</a>
<a id='line_949'>  To one, who keeps within his stedfast aim</a>
<a id='line_950'>  A love immortal, an immortal too.                             850</a>
<a id='line_951'>  Look not so wilder'd; for these things are true,</a>
<a id='line_952'>  And never can be born of atomies</a>
<a id='line_953'>  That buzz about our slumbers, like brain-flies,</a>
<a id='line_954'>  Leaving us fancy-sick. No, no, I'm sure,</a>
<a id='line_955'>  My restless spirit never could endure</a>
<a id='line_956'>  To brood so long upon one luxury,</a>
<a id='line_957'>  Unless it did, though fearfully, espy</a>
<a id='line_958'>  A hope beyond the shadow of a dream.</a>
<a id='line_959'>  My sayings will the less obscured seem,</a>
<a id='line_960'>  When I have told thee how my waking sight                     860</a>
<a id='line_961'>  Has made me scruple whether that same night</a>
<a id='line_962'>  Was pass'd in dreaming. Hearken, sweet Peona!</a>
<a id='line_963'>  Beyond the matron-temple of Latona,</a>
<a id='line_964'>  Which we should see but for these darkening boughs,</a>
<a id='line_965'>  Lies a deep hollow, from whose ragged brows</a>
<a id='line_966'>  Bushes and trees do lean all round athwart,</a>
<a id='line_967'>  And meet so nearly, that with wings outraught,</a>
<a id='line_968'>  And spreaded tail, a vulture could not glide</a>
<a id='line_969'>  Past them, but he must brush on every side.</a>
<a id='line_970'>  Some moulder'd steps lead into this cool cell,                870</a>
<a id='line_971'>  Far as the slabbed margin of a well,</a>
<a id='line_972'>  Whose patient level peeps its crystal eye</a>
<a id='line_973'>  Right upward, through the bushes, to the sky.</a>
<a id='line_974'>  Oft have I brought thee flowers, on their stalks set</a>
<a id='line_975'>  Like vestal primroses, but dark velvet</a>
<a id='line_976'>  Edges them round, and they have golden pits:</a>
<a id='line_977'>  'Twas there I got them, from the gaps and slits</a>
<a id='line_978'>  In a mossy stone, that sometimes was my seat,</a>
<a id='line_979'>  When all above was faint with mid-day heat.</a>
<a id='line_980'>  And there in strife no burning thoughts to heed,              880</a>
<a id='line_981'>  I'd bubble up the water through a reed;</a>
<a id='line_982'>  So reaching back to boy-hood: make me ships</a>
<a id='line_983'>  Of moulted feathers, touchwood, alder chips,</a>
<a id='line_984'>  With leaves stuck in them; and the Neptune be</a>
<a id='line_985'>  Of their petty ocean. Oftener, heavily,</a>
<a id='line_986'>  When love-lorn hours had left me less a child,</a>
<a id='line_987'>  I sat contemplating the figures wild</a>
<a id='line_988'>  Of o'er-head clouds melting the mirror through.</a>
<a id='line_989'>  Upon a day, while thus I watch'd, by flew</a>
<a id='line_990'>  A cloudy Cupid, with his bow and quiver;                      890</a>
<a id='line_991'>  So plainly character'd, no breeze would shiver</a>
<a id='line_992'>  The happy chance: so happy, I was fain</a>
<a id='line_993'>  To follow it upon the open plain,</a>
<a id='line_994'>  And, therefore, was just going; when, behold!</a>
<a id='line_995'>  A wonder, fair as any I have told--</a>
<a id='line_996'>  The same bright face I tasted in my sleep,</a>
<a id='line_997'>  Smiling in the clear well. My heart did leap</a>
<a id='line_998'>  Through the cool depth.--It moved as if to flee--</a>
<a id='line_999'>  I started up, when lo! refreshfully,</a>
<a id='line_1000'>  There came upon my face, in plenteous showers,                900</a>
<a id='line_1001'>  Dew-drops, and dewy buds, and leaves, and flowers,</a>
<a id='line_1002'>  Wrapping all objects from my smothered sight,</a>
<a id='line_1003'>  Bathing my spirit in a new delight.</a>
<a id='line_1004'>  Aye, such a breathless honey-feel of bliss</a>
<a id='line_1005'>  Alone preserved me from the drear abyss</a>
<a id='line_1006'>  Of death, for the fair form had gone again.</a>
<a id='line_1007'>  Pleasure is oft a visitant; but pain</a>
<a id='line_1008'>  Clings cruelly to us, like the gnawing sloth</a>
<a id='line_1009'>  On the deer's tender haunches: late, and loth,</a>
<a id='line_1010'>  'Tis scar'd away by slow returning pleasure.                  910</a>
<a id='line_1011'>  How sickening, how dark the dreadful leisure</a>
<a id='line_1012'>  Of weary days, made deeper exquisite,</a>
<a id='line_1013'>  By a fore-knowledge of unslumbrous night!</a>
<a id='line_1014'>  Like sorrow came upon me, heavier still,</a>
<a id='line_1015'>  Than when I wander'd from the poppy hill:</a>
<a id='line_1016'>  And a whole age of lingering moments crept</a>
<a id='line_1017'>  Sluggishly by, ere more contentment swept</a>
<a id='line_1018'>  Away at once the deadly yellow spleen.</a>
<a id='line_1019'>  Yes, thrice have I this fair enchantment seen;</a>
<a id='line_1020'>  Once more been tortured with renewed life.                    920</a>
<a id='line_1021'>  When last the wintry gusts gave over strife</a>
<a id='line_1022'>  With the conquering sun of spring, and left the skies</a>
<a id='line_1023'>  Warm and serene, but yet with moistened eyes</a>
<a id='line_1024'>  In pity of the shatter'd infant buds,--</a>
<a id='line_1025'>  That time thou didst adorn, with amber studs,</a>
<a id='line_1026'>  My hunting cap, because I laugh'd and smil'd,</a>
<a id='line_1027'>  Chatted with thee, and many days exil'd</a>
<a id='line_1028'>  All torment from my breast;--'twas even then,</a>
<a id='line_1029'>  Straying about, yet, coop'd up in the den</a>
<a id='line_1030'>  Of helpless discontent,--hurling my lance                     930</a>
<a id='line_1031'>  From place to place, and following at chance,</a>
<a id='line_1032'>  At last, by hap, through some young trees it struck,</a>
<a id='line_1033'>  And, plashing among bedded pebbles, stuck</a>
<a id='line_1034'>  In the middle of a brook,--whose silver ramble</a>
<a id='line_1035'>  Down twenty little falls, through reeds and bramble,</a>
<a id='line_1036'>  Tracing along, it brought me to a cave,</a>
<a id='line_1037'>  Whence it ran brightly forth, and white did lave</a>
<a id='line_1038'>  The nether sides of mossy stones and rock,--</a>
<a id='line_1039'>  'Mong which it gurgled blythe adieus, to mock</a>
<a id='line_1040'>  Its own sweet grief at parting. Overhead,                     940</a>
<a id='line_1041'>  Hung a lush scene of drooping weeds, and spread</a>
<a id='line_1042'>  Thick, as to curtain up some wood-nymph's home.</a>
<a id='line_1043'>  "Ah! impious mortal, whither do I roam?"</a>
<a id='line_1044'>  Said I, low voic'd: "Ah, whither! 'Tis the grot</a>
<a id='line_1045'>  Of Proserpine, when Hell, obscure and hot,</a>
<a id='line_1046'>  Doth her resign; and where her tender hands</a>
<a id='line_1047'>  She dabbles, on the cool and sluicy sands:</a>
<a id='line_1048'>  Or 'tis the cell of Echo, where she sits,</a>
<a id='line_1049'>  And babbles thorough silence, till her wits</a>
<a id='line_1050'>  Are gone in tender madness, and anon,                         950</a>
<a id='line_1051'>  Faints into sleep, with many a dying tone</a>
<a id='line_1052'>  Of sadness. O that she would take my vows,</a>
<a id='line_1053'>  And breathe them sighingly among the boughs,</a>
<a id='line_1054'>  To sue her gentle ears for whose fair head,</a>
<a id='line_1055'>  Daily, I pluck sweet flowerets from their bed,</a>
<a id='line_1056'>  And weave them dyingly--send honey-whispers</a>
<a id='line_1057'>  Round every leaf, that all those gentle lispers</a>
<a id='line_1058'>  May sigh my love unto her pitying!</a>
<a id='line_1059'>  O charitable echo! hear, and sing</a>
<a id='line_1060'>  This ditty to her!--tell her"--so I stay'd                    960</a>
<a id='line_1061'>  My foolish tongue, and listening, half afraid,</a>
<a id='line_1062'>  Stood stupefied with my own empty folly,</a>
<a id='line_1063'>  And blushing for the freaks of melancholy.</a>
<a id='line_1064'>  Salt tears were coming, when I heard my name</a>
<a id='line_1065'>  Most fondly lipp'd, and then these accents came:</a>
<a id='line_1066'>  "Endymion! the cave is secreter</a>
<a id='line_1067'>  Than the isle of Delos. Echo hence shall stir</a>
<a id='line_1068'>  No sighs but sigh-warm kisses, or light noise</a>
<a id='line_1069'>  Of thy combing hand, the while it travelling cloys</a>
<a id='line_1070'>  And trembles through my labyrinthine hair."                   970</a>
<a id='line_1071'>  At that oppress'd I hurried in.--Ah! where</a>
<a id='line_1072'>  Are those swift moments? Whither are they fled?</a>
<a id='line_1073'>  I'll smile no more, Peona; nor will wed</a>
<a id='line_1074'>  Sorrow the way to death; but patiently</a>
<a id='line_1075'>  Bear up against it: so farewel, sad sigh;</a>
<a id='line_1076'>  And come instead demurest meditation,</a>
<a id='line_1077'>  To occupy me wholly, and to fashion</a>
<a id='line_1078'>  My pilgrimage for the world's dusky brink.</a>
<a id='line_1079'>  No more will I count over, link by link,</a>
<a id='line_1080'>  My chain of grief: no longer strive to find                   980</a>
<a id='line_1081'>  A half-forgetfulness in mountain wind</a>
<a id='line_1082'>  Blustering about my ears: aye, thou shalt see,</a>
<a id='line_1083'>  Dearest of sisters, what my life shall be;</a>
<a id='line_1084'>  What a calm round of hours shall make my days.</a>
<a id='line_1085'>  There is a paly flame of hope that plays</a>
<a id='line_1086'>  Where'er I look: but yet, I'll say 'tis naught--</a>
<a id='line_1087'>  And here I bid it die. Have not I caught,</a>
<a id='line_1088'>  Already, a more healthy countenance?</a>
<a id='line_1089'>  By this the sun is setting; we may chance</a>
<a id='line_1090'>  Meet some of our near-dwellers with my car."                  990</a>
<a id='line_1091'></a>
<a id='line_1092'>    This said, he rose, faint-smiling like a star</a>
<a id='line_1093'>  Through autumn mists, and took Peona's hand:</a>
<a id='line_1094'>  They stept into the boat, and launch'd from land.</a>

<a id='line_1150'>  The day of sacrifice? Or, have new sorrows</a>
<a id='line_1151'>  Come with the constant dawn upon thy morrows?</a>
<a id='line_1152'>  Alas! 'tis his old grief. For many days,</a>
<a id='line_1153'>  Has he been wandering in uncertain ways:</a>
<a id='line_1154'>  Through wilderness, and woods of mossed oaks;                  50</a>
<a id='line_1155'>  Counting his woe-worn minutes, by the strokes</a>
<a id='line_1156'>  Of the lone woodcutter; and listening still,</a>
<a id='line_1157'>  Hour after hour, to each lush-leav'd rill.</a>
<a id='line_1158'>  Now he is sitting by a shady spring,</a>
<a id='line_1159'>  And elbow-deep with feverous fingering</a>
<a id='line_1160'>  Stems the upbursting cold: a wild rose tree</a>
<a id='line_1161'>  Pavilions him in bloom, and he doth see</a>
<a id='line_1162'>  A bud which snares his fancy: lo! but now</a>
<a id='line_1163'>  He plucks it, dips its stalk in the water: how!</a>
<a id='line_1164'>  It swells, it buds, it flowers beneath his sight;              60</a>
<a id='line_1165'>  And, in the middle, there is softly pight</a>
<a id='line_1166'>  A golden butterfly; upon whose wings</a>
<a id='line_1167'>  There must be surely character'd strange things,</a>
<a id='line_1168'>  For with wide eye he wonders, and smiles oft.</a>
<a id='line_1169'></a>
<a id='line_1170'>    Lightly this little herald flew aloft,</a>
<a id='line_1171'>  Follow'd by glad Endymion's clasped hands:</a>
<a id='line_1172'>  Onward it flies. From languor's sullen bands</a>
<a id='line_1173'>  His limbs are loos'd, and eager, on he hies</a>
<a id='line_1174'>  Dazzled to trace it in the sunny skies.</a>
<a id='line_1175'>  It seem'd he flew, the way so easy was;                        70</a>
<a id='line_1176'>  And like a new-born spirit did he pass</a>
<a id='line_1177'>  Through the green evening quiet in the sun,</a>
<a id='line_1178'>  O'er many a heath, through many a woodland dun,</a>
<a id='line_1179'>  Through buried paths, where sleepy twilight dreams</a>
<a id='line_1180'>  The summer time away. One track unseams</a>
<a id='line_1181'>  A wooded cleft, and, far away, the blue</a>
<a id='line_1182'>  Of ocean fades upon him; then, anew,</a>
<a id='line_1183'>  He sinks adown a solitary glen,</a>
<a id='line_1184'>  Where there was never sound of mortal men,</a>
<a id='line_1185'>  Saving, perhaps, some snow-light cadences                      80</a>
<a id='line_1186'>  Melting to silence, when upon the breeze</a>
<a id='line_1187'>  Some holy bark let forth an anthem sweet,</a>
<a id='line_1188'>  To cheer itself to Delphi. Still his feet</a>
<a id='line_1189'>  Went swift beneath the merry-winged guide,</a>
<a id='line_1190'>  Until it reached a splashing fountain's side</a>
<a id='line_1191'>  That, near a cavern's mouth, for ever pour'd</a>
<a id='line_1192'>  Unto the temperate air: then high it soar'd,</a>
<a id='line_1193'>  And, downward, suddenly began to dip,</a>
<a id='line_1194'>  As if, athirst with so much toil, 'twould sip</a>
<a id='line_1195'>  The crystal spout-head: so it did, with touch                  90</a>
<a id='line_1196'>  Most delicate, as though afraid to smutch</a>
<a id='line_1197'>  Even with mealy gold the waters clear.</a>
<a id='line_1198'>  But, at that very touch, to disappear</a>
<a id='line_1199'>  So fairy-quick, was strange! Bewildered,</a>
<a id='line_1200'>  Endymion sought around, and shook each bed</a>
<a id='line_1201'>  Of covert flowers in vain; and then he flung</a>
<a id='line_1202'>  Himself along the grass. What gentle tongue,</a>
<a id='line_1203'>  What whisperer disturb'd his gloomy rest?</a>
<a id='line_1204'>  It was a nymph uprisen to the breast</a>
<a id='line_1205'>  In the fountain's pebbly margin, and she stood                100</a>
<a id='line_1206'>  'Mong lilies, like the youngest of the brood.</a>
<a id='line_1207'>  To him her dripping hand she softly kist,</a>
<a id='line_1208'>  And anxiously began to plait and twist</a>
<a id='line_1209'>  Her ringlets round her fingers, saying: "Youth!</a>
<a id='line_1210'>  Too long, alas, hast thou starv'd on the ruth,</a>
<a id='line_1211'>  The bitterness of love: too long indeed,</a>
<a id='line_1212'>  Seeing thou art so gentle. Could I weed</a>
<a id='line_1213'>  Thy soul of care, by heavens, I would offer</a>
<a id='line_1214'>  All the bright riches of my crystal coffer</a>
<a id='line_1215'>  To Amphitrite; all my clear-eyed fish,                        110</a>
<a id='line_1216'>  Golden, or rainbow-sided, or purplish,</a>
<a id='line_1217'>  Vermilion-tail'd, or finn'd with silvery gauze;</a>
<a id='line_1218'>  Yea, or my veined pebble-floor, that draws</a>
<a id='line_1219'>  A virgin light to the deep; my grotto-sands</a>
<a id='line_1220'>  Tawny and gold, ooz'd slowly from far lands</a>
<a id='line_1221'>  By my diligent springs; my level lilies, shells,</a>
<a id='line_1222'>  My charming rod, my potent river spells;</a>
<a id='line_1223'>  Yes, every thing, even to the pearly cup</a>
<a id='line_1224'>  Meander gave me,--for I bubbled up</a>
<a id='line_1225'>  To fainting creatures in a desert wild.                       120</a>
<a id='line_1226'>  But woe is me, I am but as a child</a>
<a id='line_1227'>  To gladden thee; and all I dare to say,</a>
<a id='line_1228'>  Is, that I pity thee; that on this day</a>
<a id='line_1229'>  I've been thy guide; that thou must wander far</a>
<a id='line_1230'>  In other regions, past the scanty bar</a>
<a id='line_1231'>  To mortal steps, before thou cans't be ta'en</a>
<a id='line_1232'>  From every wasting sigh, from every pain,</a>
<a id='line_1233'>  Into the gentle bosom of thy love.</a>
<a id='line_1234'>  Why it is thus, one knows in heaven above:</a>
<a id='line_1235'>  But, a poor Naiad, I guess not. Farewel!                      130</a>
<a id='line_1236'>  I have a ditty for my hollow cell."</a>
<a id='line_1237'></a>
<a id='line_1238'>    Hereat, she vanished from Endymion's gaze,</a>
<a id='line_1239'>  Who brooded o'er the water in amaze:</a>
<a id='line_1240'>  The dashing fount pour'd on, and where its pool</a>
<a id='line_1241'>  Lay, half asleep, in grass and rushes cool,</a>
<a id='line_1242'>  Quick waterflies and gnats were sporting still,</a>
<a id='line_1243'>  And fish were dimpling, as if good nor ill</a>
<a id='line_1244'>  Had fallen out that hour. The wanderer,</a>
<a id='line_1245'>  Holding his forehead, to keep off the burr</a>
<a id='line_1246'>  Of smothering fancies, patiently sat down;                    140</a>
<a id='line_1247'>  And, while beneath the evening's sleepy frown</a>
<a id='line_1248'>  Glow-worms began to trim their starry lamps,</a>
<a id='line_1249'>  Thus breath'd he to himself: "Whoso encamps</a>
<a id='line_1250'>  To take a fancied city of delight,</a>
<a id='line_1251'>  O what a wretch is he! and when 'tis his,</a>
<a id='line_1252'>  After long toil and travelling, to miss</a>
<a id='line_1253'>  The kernel of his hopes, how more than vile:</a>
<a id='line_1254'>  Yet, for him there's refreshment even in toil;</a>
<a id='line_1255'>  Another city doth he set about,</a>
<a id='line_1256'>  Free from the smallest pebble-head of doubt                   150</a>
<a id='line_1257'>  That he will seize on trickling honey-combs:</a>
<a id='line_1258'>  Alas, he finds them dry; and then he foams,</a>
<a id='line_1259'>  And onward to another city speeds.</a>
<a id='line_1260'>  But this is human life: the war, the deeds,</a>
<a id='line_1261'>  The disappointment, the anxiety,</a>
<a id='line_1262'>  Imagination's struggles, far and nigh,</a>
<a id='line_1263'>  All human; bearing in themselves this good,</a>
<a id='line_1264'>  That they are still the air, the subtle food,</a>
<a id='line_1265'>  To make us feel existence, and to shew</a>
<a id='line_1266'>  How quiet death is. Where soil is men grow,                   160</a>
<a id='line_1267'>  Whether to weeds or flowers; but for me,</a>
<a id='line_1268'>  There is no depth to strike in: I can see</a>
<a id='line_1269'>  Nought earthly worth my compassing; so stand</a>
<a id='line_1270'>  Upon a misty, jutting head of land--</a>
<a id='line_1271'>  Alone? No, no; and by the Orphean lute,</a>
<a id='line_1272'>  When mad Eurydice is listening to't;</a>
<a id='line_1273'>  I'd rather stand upon this misty peak,</a>
<a id='line_1274'>  With not a thing to sigh for, or to seek,</a>
<a id='line_1275'>  But the soft shadow of my thrice-seen love,</a>
<a id='line_1276'>  Than be--I care not what. O meekest dove                      170</a>
<a id='line_1277'>  Of heaven! O Cynthia, ten-times bright and fair!</a>
<a id='line_1278'>  From thy blue throne, now filling all the air,</a>
<a id='line_1279'>  Glance but one little beam of temper'd light</a>
<a id='line_1280'>  Into my bosom, that the dreadful might</a>
<a id='line_1281'>  And tyranny of love be somewhat scar'd!</a>
<a id='line_1282'>  Yet do not so, sweet queen; one torment spar'd,</a>
<a id='line_1283'>  Would give a pang to jealous misery,</a>
<a id='line_1284'>  Worse than the torment's self: but rather tie</a>
<a id='line_1285'>  Large wings upon my shoulders, and point out</a>
<a id='line_1286'>  My love's far dwelling. Though the playful rout               180</a>
<a id='line_1287'>  Of Cupids shun thee, too divine art thou,</a>
<a id='line_1288'>  Too keen in beauty, for thy silver prow</a>
<a id='line_1289'>  Not to have dipp'd in love's most gentle stream.</a>
<a id='line_1290'>  O be propitious, nor severely deem</a>
<a id='line_1291'>  My madness impious; for, by all the stars</a>
<a id='line_1292'>  That tend thy bidding, I do think the bars</a>
<a id='line_1293'>  That kept my spirit in are burst--that I</a>
<a id='line_1294'>  Am sailing with thee through the dizzy sky!</a>
<a id='line_1295'>  How beautiful thou art! The world how deep!</a>
<a id='line_1296'>  How tremulous-dazzlingly the wheels sweep                     190</a>
<a id='line_1297'>  Around their axle! Then these gleaming reins,</a>
<a id='line_1298'>  How lithe! When this thy chariot attains</a>
<a id='line_1299'>  Its airy goal, haply some bower veils</a>
<a id='line_1300'>  Those twilight eyes?--Those eyes!--my spirit fails--</a>
<a id='line_1301'>  Dear goddess, help! or the wide-gaping air</a>
<a id='line_1302'>  Will gulph me--help!"--At this with madden'd stare,</a>
<a id='line_1303'>  And lifted hands, and trembling lips he stood;</a>
<a id='line_1304'>  Like old Deucalion mountain'd o'er the flood,</a>
<a id='line_1305'>  Or blind Orion hungry for the morn.</a>
<a id='line_1306'>  And, but from the deep cavern there was borne                 200</a>
<a id='line_1307'>  A voice, he had been froze to senseless stone;</a>
<a id='line_1308'>  Nor sigh of his, nor plaint, nor passion'd moan</a>
<a id='line_1309'>  Had more been heard. Thus swell'd it forth: "Descend,</a>
<a id='line_1310'>  Young mountaineer! descend where alleys bend</a>
<a id='line_1311'>  Into the sparry hollows of the world!</a>
<a id='line_1312'>  Oft hast thou seen bolts of the thunder hurl'd</a>
<a id='line_1313'>  As from thy threshold; day by day hast been</a>
<a id='line_1314'>  A little lower than the chilly sheen</a>
<a id='line_1315'>  Of icy pinnacles, and dipp'dst thine arms</a>
<a id='line_1316'>  Into the deadening ether that still charms                    210</a>
<a id='line_1317'>  Their marble being: now, as deep profound</a>
<a id='line_1318'>  As those are high, descend! He ne'er is crown'd</a>
<a id='line_1319'>  With immortality, who fears to follow</a>
<a id='line_1320'>  Where airy voices lead: so through the hollow,</a>
<a id='line_1321'>  The silent mysteries of earth, descend!"</a>
<a id='line_1322'></a>
<a id='line_1323'>    He heard but the last words, nor could contend</a>
<a id='line_1324'>  One moment in reflection: for he fled</a>
<a id='line_1325'>  Into the fearful deep, to hide his head</a>
<a id='line_1326'>  From the clear moon, the trees, and coming madness.</a>
<a id='line_1327'></a>
<a id='line_1328'>    'Twas far too strange, and wonderful for sadness;</a>
<a id='line_1329'>  Sharpening, by degrees, his appetite                          221</a>
<a id='line_1330'>  To dive into the deepest. Dark, nor light,</a>
<a id='line_1331'>  The region; nor bright, nor sombre wholly,</a>
<a id='line_1332'>  But mingled up; a gleaming melancholy;</a>
<a id='line_1333'>  A dusky empire and its diadems;</a>
<a id='line_1334'>  One faint eternal eventide of gems.</a>
<a id='line_1335'>  Aye, millions sparkled on a vein of gold,</a>
<a id='line_1336'>  Along whose track the prince quick footsteps told,</a>
<a id='line_1337'>  With all its lines abrupt and angular:</a>
<a id='line_1338'>  Out-shooting sometimes, like a meteor-star,                   230</a>
<a id='line_1339'>  Through a vast antre; then the metal woof,</a>
<a id='line_1340'>  Like Vulcan's rainbow, with some monstrous roof</a>
<a id='line_1341'>  Curves hugely: now, far in the deep abyss,</a>
<a id='line_1342'>  It seems an angry lightning, and doth hiss</a>
<a id='line_1343'>  Fancy into belief: anon it leads</a>
<a id='line_1344'>  Through winding passages, where sameness breeds</a>
<a id='line_1345'>  Vexing conceptions of some sudden change;</a>
<a id='line_1346'>  Whether to silver grots, or giant range</a>
<a id='line_1347'>  Of sapphire columns, or fantastic bridge</a>
<a id='line_1348'>  Athwart a flood of crystal. On a ridge                        240</a>
<a id='line_1349'>  Now fareth he, that o'er the vast beneath</a>
<a id='line_1350'>  Towers like an ocean-cliff, and whence he seeth</a>
<a id='line_1351'>  A hundred waterfalls, whose voices come</a>
<a id='line_1352'>  But as the murmuring surge. Chilly and numb</a>
<a id='line_1353'>  His bosom grew, when first he, far away,</a>
<a id='line_1354'>  Descried an orbed diamond, set to fray</a>
<a id='line_1355'>  Old darkness from his throne: 'twas like the sun</a>
<a id='line_1356'>  Uprisen o'er chaos: and with such a stun</a>
<a id='line_1357'>  Came the amazement, that, absorb'd in it,</a>
<a id='line_1358'>  He saw not fiercer wonders--past the wit                      250</a>
<a id='line_1359'>  Of any spirit to tell, but one of those</a>
<a id='line_1360'>  Who, when this planet's sphering time doth close,</a>
<a id='line_1361'>  Will be its high remembrancers: who they?</a>
<a id='line_1362'>  The mighty ones who have made eternal day</a>
<a id='line_1363'>  For Greece and England. While astonishment</a>
<a id='line_1364'>  With deep-drawn sighs was quieting, he went</a>
<a id='line_1365'>  Into a marble gallery, passing through</a>
<a id='line_1366'>  A mimic temple, so complete and true</a>
<a id='line_1367'>  In sacred custom, that he well nigh fear'd</a>
<a id='line_1368'>  To search it inwards; whence far off appear'd,                260</a>
<a id='line_1369'>  Through a long pillar'd vista, a fair shrine,</a>
<a id='line_1370'>  And, just beyond, on light tiptoe divine,</a>
<a id='line_1371'>  A quiver'd Dian. Stepping awfully,</a>
<a id='line_1372'>  The youth approach'd; oft turning his veil'd eye</a>
<a id='line_1373'>  Down sidelong aisles, and into niches old.</a>
<a id='line_1374'>  And when, more near against the marble cold</a>
<a id='line_1375'>  He had touch'd his forehead, he began to thread</a>
<a id='line_1376'>  All courts and passages, where silence dead</a>
<a id='line_1377'>  Rous'd by his whispering footsteps murmured faint:</a>
<a id='line_1378'>  And long he travers'd to and fro, to acquaint                 270</a>
<a id='line_1379'>  Himself with every mystery, and awe;</a>
<a id='line_1380'>  Till, weary, he sat down before the maw</a>
<a id='line_1381'>  Of a wide outlet, fathomless and dim</a>
<a id='line_1382'>  To wild uncertainty and shadows grim.</a>
<a id='line_1383'>  There, when new wonders ceas'd to float before,</a>
<a id='line_1384'>  And thoughts of self came on, how crude and sore</a>
<a id='line_1385'>  The journey homeward to habitual self!</a>
<a id='line_1386'>  A mad-pursuing of the fog-born elf,</a>
<a id='line_1387'>  Whose flitting lantern, through rude nettle-briar,</a>
<a id='line_1388'>  Cheats us into a swamp, into a fire,                          280</a>
<a id='line_1389'>  Into the bosom of a hated thing.</a>
<a id='line_1390'></a>
<a id='line_1391'>    What misery most drowningly doth sing</a>
<a id='line_1392'>  In lone Endymion's ear, now he has caught</a>
<a id='line_1393'>  The goal of consciousness? Ah, 'tis the thought,</a>
<a id='line_1394'>  The deadly feel of solitude: for lo!</a>
<a id='line_1395'>  He cannot see the heavens, nor the flow</a>
<a id='line_1396'>  Of rivers, nor hill-flowers running wild</a>
<a id='line_1397'>  In pink and purple chequer, nor, up-pil'd,</a>
<a id='line_1398'>  The cloudy rack slow journeying in the west,</a>
<a id='line_1399'>  Like herded elephants; nor felt, nor prest                    290</a>
<a id='line_1400'>  Cool grass, nor tasted the fresh slumberous air;</a>
<a id='line_1401'>  But far from such companionship to wear</a>
<a id='line_1402'>  An unknown time, surcharg'd with grief, away,</a>
<a id='line_1403'>  Was now his lot. And must he patient stay,</a>
<a id='line_1404'>  Tracing fantastic figures with his spear?</a>
<a id='line_1405'>  "No!" exclaimed he, "why should I tarry here?"</a>
<a id='line_1406'>  No! loudly echoed times innumerable.</a>
<a id='line_1407'>  At which he straightway started, and 'gan tell</a>
<a id='line_1408'>  His paces back into the temple's chief;</a>
<a id='line_1409'>  Warming and growing strong in the belief                      300</a>
<a id='line_1410'>  Of help from Dian: so that when again</a>
<a id='line_1411'>  He caught her airy form, thus did he plain,</a>
<a id='line_1412'>  Moving more near the while. "O Haunter chaste</a>
<a id='line_1413'>  Of river sides, and woods, and heathy waste,</a>
<a id='line_1414'>  Where with thy silver bow and arrows keen</a>
<a id='line_1415'>  Art thou now forested? O woodland Queen,</a>
<a id='line_1416'>  What smoothest air thy smoother forehead woos?</a>
<a id='line_1417'>  Where dost thou listen to the wide halloos</a>

<a id='line_1423'>  But, finding in our green earth sweet contents,</a>
<a id='line_1424'>  There livest blissfully. Ah, if to thee</a>

<a id='line_1426'>  An exil'd mortal, sounds its pleasant name!</a>
<a id='line_1427'>  Within my breast there lives a choking flame--</a>
<a id='line_1428'>  O let me cool it among the zephyr-boughs!</a>
<a id='line_1429'>  A homeward fever parches up my tongue--                       320</a>
<a id='line_1430'>  O let me slake it at the running springs!</a>
<a id='line_1431'>  Upon my car a noisy nothing rings--</a>
<a id='line_1432'>  O let me once more hear the linnet's note!</a>
<a id='line_1433'>  Before mine eyes thick films and shadows float--</a>
<a id='line_1434'>  O let me 'noint them with the heaven's light!</a>
<a id='line_1435'>  Dost thou now lave thy feet and ankles white?</a>
<a id='line_1436'>  O think how sweet to me the freshening sluice!</a>
<a id='line_1437'>  Dost thou now please thy thirst with berry-juice?</a>
<a id='line_1438'>  O think how this dry palate would rejoice!</a>
<a id='line_1439'>  If in soft slumber thou dost hear my voice,                   330</a>
<a id='line_1440'>  O think how I should love a bed of flowers!--</a>
<a id='line_1441'>  Young goddess! let me see my native bowers!</a>
<a id='line_1442'>  Deliver me from this rapacious deep!"</a>
<a id='line_1443'></a>
<a id='line_1444'>    Thus ending loudly, as he would o'erleap</a>
<a id='line_1445'>  His destiny, alert he stood: but when</a>
<a id='line_1446'>  Obstinate silence came heavily again,</a>
<a id='line_1447'>  Feeling about for its old couch of space</a>
<a id='line_1448'>  And airy cradle, lowly bow'd his face</a>
<a id='line_1449'>  Desponding, o'er the marble floor's cold thrill.</a>
<a id='line_1450'>  But 'twas not long; for, sweeter than the rill                340</a>
<a id='line_1451'>  To its old channel, or a swollen tide</a>
<a id='line_1452'>  To margin sallows, were the leaves he spied,</a>
<a id='line_1453'>  And flowers, and wreaths, and ready myrtle crowns</a>
<a id='line_1454'>  Up heaping through the slab: refreshment drowns</a>
<a id='line_1455'>  Itself, and strives its own delights to hide--</a>
<a id='line_1456'>  Nor in one spot alone; the floral pride</a>
<a id='line_1457'>  In a long whispering birth enchanted grew</a>
<a id='line_1458'>  Before his footsteps; as when heav'd anew</a>
<a id='line_1459'>  Old ocean rolls a lengthened wave to the shore,</a>
<a id='line_1460'>  Down whose green back the short-liv'd foam, all hoar,</a>
<a id='line_1461'>  Bursts gradual, with a wayward indolence.                     351</a>
<a id='line_1462'></a>
<a id='line_1463'>    Increasing still in heart, and pleasant sense,</a>
<a id='line_1464'>  Upon his fairy journey on he hastes;</a>
<a id='line_1465'>  So anxious for the end, he scarcely wastes</a>
<a id='line_1466'>  One moment with his hand among the sweets:</a>
<a id='line_1467'>  Onward he goes--he stops--his bosom beats</a>
<a id='line_1468'>  As plainly in his ear, as the faint charm</a>
<a id='line_1469'>  Of which the throbs were born. This still alarm,</a>
<a id='line_1470'>  This sleepy music, forc'd him walk tiptoe:</a>
<a id='line_1471'>  For it came more softly than the east could blow              360</a>
<a id='line_1472'>  Arion's magic to the Atlantic isles;</a>
<a id='line_1473'>  Or than the west, made jealous by the smiles</a>
<a id='line_1474'>  Of thron'd Apollo, could breathe back the lyre</a>
<a id='line_1475'>  To seas Ionian and Tyrian.</a>
<a id='line_1476'></a>
<a id='line_1477'>    O did he ever live, that lonely man,</a>
<a id='line_1478'>  Who lov'd--and music slew not? 'Tis the pest</a>
<a id='line_1479'>  Of love, that fairest joys give most unrest;</a>
<a id='line_1480'>  That things of delicate and tenderest worth</a>
<a id='line_1481'>  Are swallow'd all, and made a seared dearth,</a>
<a id='line_1482'>  By one consuming flame: it doth immerse                       370</a>
<a id='line_1483'>  And suffocate true blessings in a curse.</a>
<a id='line_1484'>  Half-happy, by comparison of bliss,</a>
<a id='line_1485'>  Is miserable. 'Twas even so with this</a>
<a id='line_1486'>  Dew-dropping melody, in the Carian's ear;</a>
<a id='line_1487'>  First heaven, then hell, and then forgotten clear,</a>
<a id='line_1488'>  Vanish'd in elemental passion.</a>
<a id='line_1489'></a>
<a id='line_1490'>    And down some swart abysm he had gone,</a>
<a id='line_1491'>  Had not a heavenly guide benignant led</a>
<a id='line_1492'>  To where thick myrtle branches, 'gainst his head</a>
<a id='line_1493'>  Brushing, awakened: then the sounds again                     380</a>
<a id='line_1494'>  Went noiseless as a passing noontide rain</a>
<a id='line_1495'>  Over a bower, where little space he stood;</a>
<a id='line_1496'>  For as the sunset peeps into a wood</a>
<a id='line_1497'>  So saw he panting light, and towards it went</a>
<a id='line_1498'>  Through winding alleys; and lo, wonderment!</a>
<a id='line_1499'>  Upon soft verdure saw, one here, one there,</a>
<a id='line_1500'>  Cupids a slumbering on their pinions fair.</a>
<a id='line_1501'></a>
<a id='line_1502'>    After a thousand mazes overgone,</a>
<a id='line_1503'>  At last, with sudden step, he came upon</a>
<a id='line_1504'>  A chamber, myrtle wall'd, embowered high,                     390</a>
<a id='line_1505'>  Full of light, incense, tender minstrelsy,</a>
<a id='line_1506'>  And more of beautiful and strange beside:</a>
<a id='line_1507'>  For on a silken couch of rosy pride,</a>
<a id='line_1508'>  In midst of all, there lay a sleeping youth</a>
<a id='line_1509'>  Of fondest beauty; fonder, in fair sooth,</a>
<a id='line_1510'>  Than sighs could fathom, or contentment reach:</a>
<a id='line_1511'>  And coverlids gold-tinted like the peach,</a>
<a id='line_1512'>  Or ripe October's faded marigolds,</a>
<a id='line_1513'>  Fell sleek about him in a thousand folds--</a>
<a id='line_1514'>  Not hiding up an Apollonian curve                             400</a>
<a id='line_1515'>  Of neck and shoulder, nor the tenting swerve</a>
<a id='line_1516'>  Of knee from knee, nor ankles pointing light;</a>
<a id='line_1517'>  But rather, giving them to the filled sight</a>
<a id='line_1518'>  Officiously. Sideway his face repos'd</a>
<a id='line_1519'>  On one white arm, and tenderly unclos'd,</a>
<a id='line_1520'>  By tenderest pressure, a faint damask mouth</a>
<a id='line_1521'>  To slumbery pout; just as the morning south</a>
<a id='line_1522'>  Disparts a dew-lipp'd rose. Above his head,</a>
<a id='line_1523'>  Four lily stalks did their white honours wed</a>
<a id='line_1524'>  To make a coronal; and round him grew                         410</a>
<a id='line_1525'>  All tendrils green, of every bloom and hue,</a>
<a id='line_1526'>  Together intertwin'd and trammel'd fresh:</a>
<a id='line_1527'>  The vine of glossy sprout; the ivy mesh,</a>
<a id='line_1528'>  Shading its Ethiop berries; and woodbine,</a>
<a id='line_1529'>  Of velvet leaves and bugle-blooms divine;</a>
<a id='line_1530'>  Convolvulus in streaked vases flush;</a>
<a id='line_1531'>  The creeper, mellowing for an autumn blush;</a>
<a id='line_1532'>  And virgin's bower, trailing airily;</a>
<a id='line_1533'>  With others of the sisterhood. Hard by,</a>
<a id='line_1534'>  Stood serene Cupids watching silently.                        420</a>
<a id='line_1535'>  One, kneeling to a lyre, touch'd the strings,</a>
<a id='line_1536'>  Muffling to death the pathos with his wings;</a>
<a id='line_1537'>  And, ever and anon, uprose to look</a>
<a id='line_1538'>  At the youth's slumber; while another took</a>
<a id='line_1539'>  A willow-bough, distilling odorous dew,</a>
<a id='line_1540'>  And shook it on his hair; another flew</a>
<a id='line_1541'>  In through the woven roof, and fluttering-wise</a>
<a id='line_1542'>  Rain'd violets upon his sleeping eyes.</a>
<a id='line_1543'></a>
<a id='line_1544'>    At these enchantments, and yet many more,</a>
<a id='line_1545'>  The breathless Latmian wonder'd o'er and o'er;                430</a>
<a id='line_1546'>  Until, impatient in embarrassment,</a>
<a id='line_1547'>  He forthright pass'd, and lightly treading went</a>
<a id='line_1548'>  To that same feather'd lyrist, who straightway,</a>
<a id='line_1549'>  Smiling, thus whisper'd: "Though from upper day</a>
<a id='line_1550'>  Thou art a wanderer, and thy presence here</a>
<a id='line_1551'>  Might seem unholy, be of happy cheer!</a>
<a id='line_1552'>  For 'tis the nicest touch of human honour,</a>
<a id='line_1553'>  When some ethereal and high-favouring donor</a>
<a id='line_1554'>  Presents immortal bowers to mortal sense;</a>
<a id='line_1555'>  As now 'tis done to thee, Endymion. Hence                     440</a>
<a id='line_1556'>  Was I in no wise startled. So recline</a>
<a id='line_1557'>  Upon these living flowers. Here is wine,</a>
<a id='line_1558'>  Alive with sparkles--never, I aver,</a>
<a id='line_1559'>  Since Ariadne was a vintager,</a>
<a id='line_1560'>  So cool a purple: taste these juicy pears,</a>
<a id='line_1561'>  Sent me by sad Vertumnus, when his fears</a>
<a id='line_1562'>  Were high about Pomona: here is cream,</a>
<a id='line_1563'>  Deepening to richness from a snowy gleam;</a>
<a id='line_1564'>  Sweeter than that nurse Amalthea skimm'd</a>
<a id='line_1565'>  For the boy Jupiter: and here, undimm'd                       450</a>
<a id='line_1566'>  By any touch, a bunch of blooming plums</a>
<a id='line_1567'>  Ready to melt between an infant's gums:</a>
<a id='line_1568'>  And here is manna pick'd from Syrian trees,</a>
<a id='line_1569'>  In starlight, by the three Hesperides.</a>
<a id='line_1570'>  Feast on, and meanwhile I will let thee know</a>
<a id='line_1571'>  Of all these things around us." He did so,</a>
<a id='line_1572'>  Still brooding o'er the cadence of his lyre;</a>
<a id='line_1573'>  And thus: "I need not any hearing tire</a>
<a id='line_1574'>  By telling how the sea-born goddess pin'd</a>
<a id='line_1575'>  For a mortal youth, and how she strove to bind                460</a>
<a id='line_1576'>  Him all in all unto her doting self.</a>
<a id='line_1577'>  Who would not be so prison'd? but, fond elf,</a>
<a id='line_1578'>  He was content to let her amorous plea</a>
<a id='line_1579'>  Faint through his careless arms; content to see</a>
<a id='line_1580'>  An unseiz'd heaven dying at his feet;</a>
<a id='line_1581'>  Content, O fool! to make a cold retreat,</a>
<a id='line_1582'>  When on the pleasant grass such love, lovelorn,</a>
<a id='line_1583'>  Lay sorrowing; when every tear was born</a>
<a id='line_1584'>  Of diverse passion; when her lips and eyes</a>
<a id='line_1585'>  Were clos'd in sullen moisture, and quick sighs               470</a>
<a id='line_1586'>  Came vex'd and pettish through her nostrils small.</a>
<a id='line_1587'>  Hush! no exclaim--yet, justly mightst thou call</a>
<a id='line_1588'>  Curses upon his head.--I was half glad,</a>
<a id='line_1589'>  But my poor mistress went distract and mad,</a>
<a id='line_1590'>  When the boar tusk'd him: so away she flew</a>
<a id='line_1591'>  To Jove's high throne, and by her plainings drew</a>
<a id='line_1592'>  Immortal tear-drops down the thunderer's beard;</a>
<a id='line_1593'>  Whereon, it was decreed he should be rear'd</a>
<a id='line_1594'>  Each summer time to life. Lo! this is he,</a>
<a id='line_1595'>  That same Adonis, safe in the privacy                         480</a>
<a id='line_1596'>  Of this still region all his winter-sleep.</a>
<a id='line_1597'>  Aye, sleep; for when our love-sick queen did weep</a>
<a id='line_1598'>  Over his waned corse, the tremulous shower</a>
<a id='line_1599'>  Heal'd up the wound, and, with a balmy power,</a>
<a id='line_1600'>  Medicined death to a lengthened drowsiness:</a>
<a id='line_1601'>  The which she fills with visions, and doth dress</a>
<a id='line_1602'>  In all this quiet luxury; and hath set</a>
<a id='line_1603'>  Us young immortals, without any let,</a>
<a id='line_1604'>  To watch his slumber through. 'Tis well nigh pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_1605'>  Even to a moment's filling up, and fast                       490</a>
<a id='line_1606'>  She scuds with summer breezes, to pant through</a>
<a id='line_1607'>  The first long kiss, warm firstling, to renew</a>
<a id='line_1608'>  Embower'd sports in Cytherea's isle.</a>
<a id='line_1609'>  Look! how those winged listeners all this while</a>
<a id='line_1610'>  Stand anxious: see! behold!"--This clamant word</a>
<a id='line_1611'>  Broke through the careful silence; for they heard</a>
<a id='line_1612'>  A rustling noise of leaves, and out there flutter'd</a>
<a id='line_1613'>  Pigeons and doves: Adonis something mutter'd,</a>
<a id='line_1614'>  The while one hand, that erst upon his thigh</a>
<a id='line_1615'>  Lay dormant, mov'd convuls'd and gradually                    500</a>
<a id='line_1616'>  Up to his forehead. Then there was a hum</a>
<a id='line_1617'>  Of sudden voices, echoing, "Come! come!</a>
<a id='line_1618'>  Arise! awake! Clear summer has forth walk'd</a>
<a id='line_1619'>  Unto the clover-sward, and she has talk'd</a>
<a id='line_1620'>  Full soothingly to every nested finch:</a>
<a id='line_1621'>  Rise, Cupids! or we'll give the blue-bell pinch</a>
<a id='line_1622'>  To your dimpled arms. Once more sweet life begin!"</a>
<a id='line_1623'>  At this, from every side they hurried in,</a>
<a id='line_1624'>  Rubbing their sleepy eyes with lazy wrists,</a>
<a id='line_1625'>  And doubling over head their little fists                     510</a>
<a id='line_1626'>  In backward yawns. But all were soon alive:</a>
<a id='line_1627'>  For as delicious wine doth, sparkling, dive</a>
<a id='line_1628'>  In nectar'd clouds and curls through water fair,</a>
<a id='line_1629'>  So from the arbour roof down swell'd an air</a>
<a id='line_1630'>  Odorous and enlivening; making all</a>
<a id='line_1631'>  To laugh, and play, and sing, and loudly call</a>
<a id='line_1632'>  For their sweet queen: when lo! the wreathed green</a>
<a id='line_1633'>  Disparted, and far upward could be seen</a>
<a id='line_1634'>  Blue heaven, and a silver car, air-borne,</a>
<a id='line_1635'>  Whose silent wheels, fresh wet from clouds of morn,</a>
<a id='line_1636'>  Spun off a drizzling dew,--which falling chill                521</a>
<a id='line_1637'>  On soft Adonis' shoulders, made him still</a>
<a id='line_1638'>  Nestle and turn uneasily about.</a>
<a id='line_1639'>  Soon were the white doves plain, with necks stretch'd out,</a>
<a id='line_1640'>  And silken traces lighten'd in descent;</a>
<a id='line_1641'>  And soon, returning from love's banishment,</a>
<a id='line_1642'>  Queen Venus leaning downward open arm'd:</a>
<a id='line_1643'>  Her shadow fell upon his breast, and charm'd</a>
<a id='line_1644'>  A tumult to his heart, and a new life</a>
<a id='line_1645'>  Into his eyes. Ah, miserable strife,                          530</a>
<a id='line_1646'>  But for her comforting! unhappy sight,</a>
<a id='line_1647'>  But meeting her blue orbs! Who, who can write</a>
<a id='line_1648'>  Of these first minutes? The unchariest muse</a>
<a id='line_1649'>  To embracements warm as theirs makes coy excuse.</a>
<a id='line_1650'></a>
<a id='line_1651'>    O it has ruffled every spirit there,</a>
<a id='line_1652'>  Saving love's self, who stands superb to share</a>
<a id='line_1653'>  The general gladness: awfully he stands;</a>
<a id='line_1654'>  A sovereign quell is in his waving hands;</a>
<a id='line_1655'>  No sight can bear the lightning of his bow;</a>
<a id='line_1656'>  His quiver is mysterious, none can know                       540</a>
<a id='line_1657'>  What themselves think of it; from forth his eyes</a>
<a id='line_1658'>  There darts strange light of varied hues and dyes:</a>
<a id='line_1659'>  A scowl is sometimes on his brow, but who</a>
<a id='line_1660'>  Look full upon it feel anon the blue</a>
<a id='line_1661'>  Of his fair eyes run liquid through their souls.</a>
<a id='line_1662'>  Endymion feels it, and no more controls</a>
<a id='line_1663'>  The burning prayer within him; so, bent low,</a>
<a id='line_1664'>  He had begun a plaining of his woe.</a>
<a id='line_1665'>  But Venus, bending forward, said: "My child,</a>
<a id='line_1666'>  Favour this gentle youth; his days are wild                   550</a>
<a id='line_1667'>  With love--he--but alas! too well I see</a>
<a id='line_1668'>  Thou know'st the deepness of his misery.</a>
<a id='line_1669'>  Ah, smile not so, my son: I tell thee true,</a>
<a id='line_1670'>  That when through heavy hours I used to rue</a>
<a id='line_1671'>  The endless sleep of this new-born Adon',</a>
<a id='line_1672'>  This stranger ay I pitied. For upon</a>
<a id='line_1673'>  A dreary morning once I fled away</a>
<a id='line_1674'>  Into the breezy clouds, to weep and pray</a>
<a id='line_1675'>  For this my love: for vexing Mars had teaz'd</a>
<a id='line_1676'>  Me even to tears: thence, when a little eas'd,                560</a>
<a id='line_1677'>  Down-looking, vacant, through a hazy wood,</a>
<a id='line_1678'>  I saw this youth as he despairing stood:</a>
<a id='line_1679'>  Those same dark curls blown vagrant in the wind;</a>
<a id='line_1680'>  Those same full fringed lids a constant blind</a>
<a id='line_1681'>  Over his sullen eyes: I saw him throw</a>
<a id='line_1682'>  Himself on wither'd leaves, even as though</a>
<a id='line_1683'>  Death had come sudden; for no jot he mov'd,</a>
<a id='line_1684'>  Yet mutter'd wildly. I could hear he lov'd</a>
<a id='line_1685'>  Some fair immortal, and that his embrace</a>
<a id='line_1686'>  Had zoned her through the night. There is no trace            570</a>
<a id='line_1687'>  Of this in heaven: I have mark'd each cheek,</a>
<a id='line_1688'>  And find it is the vainest thing to seek;</a>
<a id='line_1689'>  And that of all things 'tis kept secretest.</a>
<a id='line_1690'>  Endymion! one day thou wilt be blest:</a>
<a id='line_1691'>  So still obey the guiding hand that fends</a>
<a id='line_1692'>  Thee safely through these wonders for sweet ends.</a>
<a id='line_1693'>  'Tis a concealment needful in extreme;</a>
<a id='line_1694'>  And if I guess'd not so, the sunny beam</a>
<a id='line_1695'>  Thou shouldst mount up to with me. Now adieu!</a>
<a id='line_1696'>  Here must we leave thee."--At these words up flew             580</a>
<a id='line_1697'>  The impatient doves, up rose the floating car,</a>
<a id='line_1698'>  Up went the hum celestial. High afar</a>
<a id='line_1699'>  The Latmian saw them minish into nought;</a>
<a id='line_1700'>  And, when all were clear vanish'd, still he caught</a>
<a id='line_1701'>  A vivid lightning from that dreadful bow.</a>
<a id='line_1702'>  When all was darkened, with Etnean throe</a>
<a id='line_1703'>  The earth clos'd--gave a solitary moan--</a>
<a id='line_1704'>  And left him once again in twilight lone.</a>
<a id='line_1705'></a>
<a id='line_1706'>    He did not rave, he did not stare aghast,</a>
<a id='line_1707'>  For all those visions were o'ergone, and past,                590</a>
<a id='line_1708'>  And he in loneliness: he felt assur'd</a>
<a id='line_1709'>  Of happy times, when all he had endur'd</a>
<a id='line_1710'>  Would seem a feather to the mighty prize.</a>
<a id='line_1711'>  So, with unusual gladness, on he hies</a>
<a id='line_1712'>  Through caves, and palaces of mottled ore,</a>
<a id='line_1713'>  Gold dome, and crystal wall, and turquois floor,</a>
<a id='line_1714'>  Black polish'd porticos of awful shade,</a>
<a id='line_1715'>  And, at the last, a diamond balustrade,</a>
<a id='line_1716'>  Leading afar past wild magnificence,</a>
<a id='line_1717'>  Spiral through ruggedest loopholes, and thence                600</a>
<a id='line_1718'>  Stretching across a void, then guiding o'er</a>
<a id='line_1719'>  Enormous chasms, where, all foam and roar,</a>
<a id='line_1720'>  Streams subterranean tease their granite beds;</a>
<a id='line_1721'>  Then heighten'd just above the silvery heads</a>
<a id='line_1722'>  Of a thousand fountains, so that he could dash</a>
<a id='line_1723'>  The waters with his spear; but at the splash,</a>
<a id='line_1724'>  Done heedlessly, those spouting columns rose</a>
<a id='line_1725'>  Sudden a poplar's height, and 'gan to enclose</a>
<a id='line_1726'>  His diamond path with fretwork, streaming round</a>
<a id='line_1727'>  Alive, and dazzling cool, and with a sound,                   610</a>
<a id='line_1728'>  Haply, like dolphin tumults, when sweet shells</a>
<a id='line_1729'>  Welcome the float of Thetis. Long he dwells</a>
<a id='line_1730'>  On this delight; for, every minute's space,</a>
<a id='line_1731'>  The streams with changed magic interlace:</a>
<a id='line_1732'>  Sometimes like delicatest lattices,</a>
<a id='line_1733'>  Cover'd with crystal vines; then weeping trees,</a>
<a id='line_1734'>  Moving about as in a gentle wind,</a>
<a id='line_1735'>  Which, in a wink, to watery gauze refin'd,</a>
<a id='line_1736'>  Pour'd into shapes of curtain'd canopies,</a>
<a id='line_1737'>  Spangled, and rich with liquid broideries                     620</a>
<a id='line_1738'>  Of flowers, peacocks, swans, and naiads fair.</a>
<a id='line_1739'>  Swifter than lightning went these wonders rare;</a>
<a id='line_1740'>  And then the water, into stubborn streams</a>
<a id='line_1741'>  Collecting, mimick'd the wrought oaken beams,</a>
<a id='line_1742'>  Pillars, and frieze, and high fantastic roof,</a>
<a id='line_1743'>  Of those dusk places in times far aloof</a>
<a id='line_1744'>  Cathedrals call'd. He bade a loth farewel</a>
<a id='line_1745'>  To these founts Protean, passing gulph, and dell,</a>
<a id='line_1746'>  And torrent, and ten thousand jutting shapes,</a>
<a id='line_1747'>  Half seen through deepest gloom, and griesly gapes,           630</a>
<a id='line_1748'>  Blackening on every side, and overhead</a>
<a id='line_1749'>  A vaulted dome like Heaven's, far bespread</a>
<a id='line_1750'>  With starlight gems: aye, all so huge and strange,</a>
<a id='line_1751'>  The solitary felt a hurried change</a>
<a id='line_1752'>  Working within him into something dreary,--</a>
<a id='line_1753'>  Vex'd like a morning eagle, lost, and weary,</a>
<a id='line_1754'>  And purblind amid foggy, midnight wolds.</a>
<a id='line_1755'>  But he revives at once: for who beholds</a>
<a id='line_1756'>  New sudden things, nor casts his mental slough?</a>
<a id='line_1757'>  Forth from a rugged arch, in the dusk below,                  640</a>
<a id='line_1758'>  Came mother Cybele! alone--alone--</a>
<a id='line_1759'>  In sombre chariot; dark foldings thrown</a>
<a id='line_1760'>  About her majesty, and front death-pale,</a>
<a id='line_1761'>  With turrets crown'd. Four maned lions hale</a>
<a id='line_1762'>  The sluggish wheels; solemn their toothed maws,</a>
<a id='line_1763'>  Their surly eyes brow-hidden, heavy paws</a>
<a id='line_1764'>  Uplifted drowsily, and nervy tails</a>
<a id='line_1765'>  Cowering their tawny brushes. Silent sails</a>
<a id='line_1766'>  This shadowy queen athwart, and faints away</a>
<a id='line_1767'>  In another gloomy arch.                                       650</a>
<a id='line_1768'></a>
<a id='line_1769'>                           Wherefore delay,</a>
<a id='line_1770'>  Young traveller, in such a mournful place?</a>
<a id='line_1771'>  Art thou wayworn, or canst not further trace</a>
<a id='line_1772'>  The diamond path? And does it indeed end</a>
<a id='line_1773'>  Abrupt in middle air? Yet earthward bend</a>
<a id='line_1774'>  Thy forehead, and to Jupiter cloud-borne</a>
<a id='line_1775'>  Call ardently! He was indeed wayworn;</a>
<a id='line_1776'>  Abrupt, in middle air, his way was lost;</a>
<a id='line_1777'>  To cloud-borne Jove he bowed, and there crost</a>
<a id='line_1778'>  Towards him a large eagle, 'twixt whose wings,                660</a>
<a id='line_1779'>  Without one impious word, himself he flings,</a>
<a id='line_1780'>  Committed to the darkness and the gloom:</a>
<a id='line_1781'>  Down, down, uncertain to what pleasant doom,</a>
<a id='line_1782'>  Swift as a fathoming plummet down he fell</a>
<a id='line_1783'>  Through unknown things; till exhaled asphodel,</a>
<a id='line_1784'>  And rose, with spicy fannings interbreath'd,</a>
<a id='line_1785'>  Came swelling forth where little caves were wreath'd</a>
<a id='line_1786'>  So thick with leaves and mosses, that they seem'd</a>
<a id='line_1787'>  Large honey-combs of green, and freshly teem'd</a>
<a id='line_1788'>  With airs delicious. In the greenest nook                     670</a>
<a id='line_1789'>  The eagle landed him, and farewel took.</a>
<a id='line_1790'></a>
<a id='line_1791'>    It was a jasmine bower, all bestrown</a>
<a id='line_1792'>  With golden moss. His every sense had grown</a>
<a id='line_1793'>  Ethereal for pleasure; 'bove his head</a>
<a id='line_1794'>  Flew a delight half-graspable; his tread</a>
<a id='line_1795'>  Was Hesperean; to his capable ears</a>
<a id='line_1796'>  Silence was music from the holy spheres;</a>
<a id='line_1797'>  A dewy luxury was in his eyes;</a>
<a id='line_1798'>  The little flowers felt his pleasant sighs</a>
<a id='line_1799'>  And stirr'd them faintly. Verdant cave and cell               680</a>
<a id='line_1800'>  He wander'd through, oft wondering at such swell</a>
<a id='line_1801'>  Of sudden exaltation: but, "Alas!</a>
<a id='line_1802'>  Said he, "will all this gush of feeling pass</a>
<a id='line_1803'>  Away in solitude? And must they wane,</a>
<a id='line_1804'>  Like melodies upon a sandy plain,</a>
<a id='line_1805'>  Without an echo? Then shall I be left</a>
<a id='line_1806'>  So sad, so melancholy, so bereft!</a>
<a id='line_1807'>  Yet still I feel immortal! O my love,</a>
<a id='line_1808'>  My breath of life, where art thou? High above,</a>

<a id='line_1812'>  One of shell-winding Triton's bright-hair'd daughters?</a>
<a id='line_1813'>  Or art, impossible! a nymph of Dian's,</a>
<a id='line_1814'>  Weaving a coronal of tender scions</a>
<a id='line_1815'>  For very idleness? Where'er thou art,</a>
<a id='line_1816'>  Methinks it now is at my will to start</a>
<a id='line_1817'>  Into thine arms; to scare Aurora's train,</a>
<a id='line_1818'>  And snatch thee from the morning; o'er the main</a>
<a id='line_1819'>  To scud like a wild bird, and take thee off                   700</a>
<a id='line_1820'>  From thy sea-foamy cradle; or to doff</a>
<a id='line_1821'>  Thy shepherd vest, and woo thee mid fresh leaves.</a>
<a id='line_1822'>  No, no, too eagerly my soul deceives</a>
<a id='line_1823'>  Its powerless self: I know this cannot be.</a>
<a id='line_1824'>  O let me then by some sweet dreaming flee</a>
<a id='line_1825'>  To her entrancements: hither sleep awhile!</a>
<a id='line_1826'>  Hither most gentle sleep! and soothing foil</a>
<a id='line_1827'>  For some few hours the coming solitude."</a>
<a id='line_1828'></a>
<a id='line_1829'>    Thus spake he, and that moment felt endued</a>
<a id='line_1830'>  With power to dream deliciously; so wound                     710</a>
<a id='line_1831'>  Through a dim passage, searching till he found</a>
<a id='line_1832'>  The smoothest mossy bed and deepest, where</a>
<a id='line_1833'>  He threw himself, and just into the air</a>
<a id='line_1834'>  Stretching his indolent arms, he took, O bliss!</a>
<a id='line_1835'>  A naked waist: "Fair Cupid, whence is this?"</a>
<a id='line_1836'>  A well-known voice sigh'd, "Sweetest, here am I!"</a>
<a id='line_1837'>  At which soft ravishment, with doating cry</a>
<a id='line_1838'>  They trembled to each other.--Helicon!</a>
<a id='line_1839'>  O fountain'd hill! Old Homer's Helicon!</a>
<a id='line_1840'>  That thou wouldst spout a little streamlet o'er               720</a>
<a id='line_1841'>  These sorry pages; then the verse would soar</a>
<a id='line_1842'>  And sing above this gentle pair, like lark</a>
<a id='line_1843'>  Over his nested young: but all is dark</a>
<a id='line_1844'>  Around thine aged top, and thy clear fount</a>
<a id='line_1845'>  Exhales in mists to heaven. Aye, the count</a>
<a id='line_1846'>  Of mighty Poets is made up; the scroll</a>
<a id='line_1847'>  Is folded by the Muses; the bright roll</a>
<a id='line_1848'>  Is in Apollo's hand: our dazed eyes</a>

<a id='line_1854'>  A quill immortal in their joyous tears.</a>
<a id='line_1855'>  Long time in silence did their anxious fears</a>
<a id='line_1856'>  Question that thus it was; long time they lay</a>
<a id='line_1857'>  Fondling and kissing every doubt away;</a>
<a id='line_1858'>  Long time ere soft caressing sobs began</a>
<a id='line_1859'>  To mellow into words, and then there ran</a>
<a id='line_1860'>  Two bubbling springs of talk from their sweet lips.           740</a>
<a id='line_1861'>  "O known Unknown! from whom my being sips</a>

<a id='line_1902'>  Or thou wilt force me from this secrecy,</a>

<a id='line_1905'>  At my lost brightness, my impassion'd wiles,</a>
<a id='line_1906'>  Had waned from Olympus' solemn height,</a>
<a id='line_1907'>  And from all serious Gods; that our delight</a>
<a id='line_1908'>  Was quite forgotten, save of us alone!</a>
<a id='line_1909'>  And wherefore so ashamed? 'Tis but to atone</a>
<a id='line_1910'>  For endless pleasure, by some coward blushes:                 790</a>

<a id='line_1912'>  Too palpable before me--the sad look</a>
<a id='line_1913'>  Of Jove--Minerva's start--no bosom shook</a>
<a id='line_1914'>  With awe of purity--no Cupid pinion</a>
<a id='line_1915'>  In reverence veiled--my crystalline dominion</a>
<a id='line_1916'>  Half lost, and all old hymns made nullity!</a>
<a id='line_1917'>  But what is this to love? O I could fly</a>
<a id='line_1918'>  With thee into the ken of heavenly powers,</a>
<a id='line_1919'>  So thou wouldst thus, for many sequent hours,</a>
<a id='line_1920'>  Press me so sweetly. Now I swear at once                      800</a>
<a id='line_1921'>  That I am wise, that Pallas is a dunce--</a>
<a id='line_1922'>  Perhaps her love like mine is but unknown--</a>

<a id='line_1924'>  In chastity: yes, Pallas has been sighing,</a>
<a id='line_1925'>  While every eye saw me my hair uptying</a>
<a id='line_1926'>  With fingers cool as aspen leaves. Sweet love,</a>
<a id='line_1927'>  I was as vague as solitary dove,</a>
<a id='line_1928'>  Nor knew that nests were built. Now a soft kiss--</a>
<a id='line_1929'>  Aye, by that kiss, I vow an endless bliss,</a>
<a id='line_1930'>  An immortality of passion's thine:                            810</a>
<a id='line_1931'>  Ere long I will exalt thee to the shine</a>
<a id='line_1932'>  Of heaven ambrosial; and we will shade</a>
<a id='line_1933'>  Ourselves whole summers by a river glade;</a>
<a id='line_1934'>  And I will tell thee stories of the sky,</a>
<a id='line_1935'>  And breathe thee whispers of its minstrelsy.</a>
<a id='line_1936'>  My happy love will overwing all bounds!</a>
<a id='line_1937'>  O let me melt into thee; let the sounds</a>
<a id='line_1938'>  Of our close voices marry at their birth;</a>
<a id='line_1939'>  Let us entwine hoveringly--O dearth</a>
<a id='line_1940'>  Of human words! roughness of mortal speech!                   820</a>
<a id='line_1941'>  Lispings empyrean will I sometime teach</a>
<a id='line_1942'>  Thine honied tongue--lute-breathings, which I gasp</a>
<a id='line_1943'>  To have thee understand, now while I clasp</a>
<a id='line_1944'>  Thee thus, and weep for fondness--I am pain'd,</a>
<a id='line_1945'>  Endymion: woe! woe! is grief contain'd</a>
<a id='line_1946'>  In the very deeps of pleasure, my sole life?"--</a>
<a id='line_1947'>  Hereat, with many sobs, her gentle strife</a>
<a id='line_1948'>  Melted into a languor. He return'd</a>
<a id='line_1949'>  Entranced vows and tears.</a>
<a id='line_1950'></a>
<a id='line_1951'>                            Ye who have yearn'd                 830</a>
<a id='line_1952'>  With too much passion, will here stay and pity,</a>
<a id='line_1953'>  For the mere sake of truth; as 'tis a ditty</a>
<a id='line_1954'>  Not of these days, but long ago 'twas told</a>
<a id='line_1955'>  By a cavern wind unto a forest old;</a>
<a id='line_1956'>  And then the forest told it in a dream</a>
<a id='line_1957'>  To a sleeping lake, whose cool and level gleam</a>
<a id='line_1958'>  A poet caught as he was journeying</a>
<a id='line_1959'>  To PhÅbus' shrine; and in it he did fling</a>
<a id='line_1960'>  His weary limbs, bathing an hour's space,</a>
<a id='line_1961'>  And after, straight in that inspired place                    840</a>
<a id='line_1962'>  He sang the story up into the air,</a>
<a id='line_1963'>  Giving it universal freedom. There</a>
<a id='line_1964'>  Has it been ever sounding for those ears</a>
<a id='line_1965'>  Whose tips are glowing hot. The legend cheers</a>
<a id='line_1966'>  Yon centinel stars; and he who listens to it</a>
<a id='line_1967'>  Must surely be self-doomed or he will rue it:</a>
<a id='line_1968'>  For quenchless burnings come upon the heart,</a>
<a id='line_1969'>  Made fiercer by a fear lest any part</a>
<a id='line_1970'>  Should be engulphed in the eddying wind.</a>
<a id='line_1971'>  As much as here is penn'd doth always find                    850</a>
<a id='line_1972'>  A resting place, thus much comes clear and plain;</a>
<a id='line_1973'>  Anon the strange voice is upon the wane--</a>
<a id='line_1974'>  And 'tis but echo'd from departing sound,</a>
<a id='line_1975'>  That the fair visitant at last unwound</a>
<a id='line_1976'>  Her gentle limbs, and left the youth asleep.--</a>
<a id='line_1977'>  Thus the tradition of the gusty deep.</a>
<a id='line_1978'></a>
<a id='line_1979'>    Now turn we to our former chroniclers.--</a>
<a id='line_1980'>  Endymion awoke, that grief of hers</a>
<a id='line_1981'>  Sweet paining on his ear: he sickly guess'd</a>
<a id='line_1982'>  How lone he was once more, and sadly press'd                  860</a>
<a id='line_1983'>  His empty arms together, hung his head,</a>
<a id='line_1984'>  And most forlorn upon that widow'd bed</a>
<a id='line_1985'>  Sat silently. Love's madness he had known:</a>
<a id='line_1986'>  Often with more than tortured lion's groan</a>
<a id='line_1987'>  Moanings had burst from him; but now that rage</a>
<a id='line_1988'>  Had pass'd away: no longer did he wage</a>
<a id='line_1989'>  A rough-voic'd war against the dooming stars.</a>
<a id='line_1990'>  No, he had felt too much for such harsh jars:</a>
<a id='line_1991'>  The lyre of his soul Eolian tun'd</a>
<a id='line_1992'>  Forgot all violence, and but commun'd                         870</a>
<a id='line_1993'>  With melancholy thought: O he had swoon'd</a>
<a id='line_1994'>  Drunken from pleasure's nipple; and his love</a>
<a id='line_1995'>  Henceforth was dove-like.--Loth was he to move</a>
<a id='line_1996'>  From the imprinted couch, and when he did,</a>
<a id='line_1997'>  'Twas with slow, languid paces, and face hid</a>
<a id='line_1998'>  In muffling hands. So temper'd, out he stray'd</a>
<a id='line_1999'>  Half seeing visions that might have dismay'd</a>
<a id='line_2000'>  Alecto's serpents; ravishments more keen</a>
<a id='line_2001'>  Than Hermes' pipe, when anxious he did lean</a>
<a id='line_2002'>  Over eclipsing eyes: and at the last                          880</a>
<a id='line_2003'>  It was a sounding grotto, vaulted, vast,</a>
<a id='line_2004'>  O'er studded with a thousand, thousand pearls,</a>
<a id='line_2005'>  And crimson mouthed shells with stubborn curls,</a>
<a id='line_2006'>  Of every shape and size, even to the bulk</a>
<a id='line_2007'>  In which whales arbour close, to brood and sulk</a>
<a id='line_2008'>  Against an endless storm. Moreover too,</a>
<a id='line_2009'>  Fish-semblances, of green and azure hue,</a>
<a id='line_2010'>  Ready to snort their streams. In this cool wonder</a>
<a id='line_2011'>  Endymion sat down, and 'gan to ponder</a>
<a id='line_2012'>  On all his life: his youth, up to the day                     890</a>
<a id='line_2013'>  When 'mid acclaim, and feasts, and garlands gay,</a>
<a id='line_2014'>  He stept upon his shepherd throne: the look</a>
<a id='line_2015'>  Of his white palace in wild forest nook,</a>
<a id='line_2016'>  And all the revels he had lorded there:</a>
<a id='line_2017'>  Each tender maiden whom he once thought fair,</a>
<a id='line_2018'>  With every friend and fellow-woodlander--</a>
<a id='line_2019'>  Pass'd like a dream before him. Then the spur</a>
<a id='line_2020'>  Of the old bards to mighty deeds: his plans</a>
<a id='line_2021'>  To nurse the golden age 'mong shepherd clans:</a>
<a id='line_2022'>  That wondrous night: the great Pan-festival:                  900</a>
<a id='line_2023'>  His sister's sorrow; and his wanderings all,</a>
<a id='line_2024'>  Until into the earth's deep maw he rush'd:</a>
<a id='line_2025'>  Then all its buried magic, till it flush'd</a>
<a id='line_2026'>  High with excessive love. "And now," thought he,</a>
<a id='line_2027'>  "How long must I remain in jeopardy</a>
<a id='line_2028'>  Of blank amazements that amaze no more?</a>
<a id='line_2029'>  Now I have tasted her sweet soul to the core</a>

<a id='line_2041'>  He kept an anxious ear. The humming tone</a>
<a id='line_2042'>  Came louder, and behold, there as he lay,                     920</a>
<a id='line_2043'>  On either side outgush'd, with misty spray,</a>
<a id='line_2044'>  A copious spring; and both together dash'd</a>

<a id='line_2046'>  Among the conchs and shells of the lofty grot,</a>
<a id='line_2047'>  Leaving a trickling dew. At last they shot</a>
<a id='line_2048'>  Down from the ceiling's height, pouring a noise</a>
<a id='line_2049'>  As of some breathless racers whose hopes poize</a>
<a id='line_2050'>  Upon the last few steps, and with spent force</a>
<a id='line_2051'>  Along the ground they took a winding course.</a>
<a id='line_2052'>  Endymion follow'd--for it seem'd that one                     930</a>

<a id='line_2054'>  Follow'd their languid mazes, till well nigh</a>
<a id='line_2055'>  He had left thinking of the mystery,--</a>
<a id='line_2056'>  And was now rapt in tender hoverings</a>
<a id='line_2057'>  Over the vanish'd bliss. Ah! what is it sings</a>
<a id='line_2058'>  His dream away? What melodies are these?</a>
<a id='line_2059'>  They sound as through the whispering of trees,</a>
<a id='line_2060'>  Not native in such barren vaults. Give ear!</a>

<a id='line_2064'>  Why didst thou hear her prayer? O that I</a>

<a id='line_2067'>  To entice her to a dive! then stealing in</a>
<a id='line_2068'>  Between her luscious lips and eyelids thin.</a>
<a id='line_2069'>  O that her shining hair was in the sun,</a>
<a id='line_2070'>  And I distilling from it thence to run</a>
<a id='line_2071'>  In amorous rillets down her shrinking form!</a>

<a id='line_2268'>  To breathlessness, and suddenly a warm</a>
<a id='line_2269'>  Of his heart's blood: 'twas very sweet; he stay'd</a>
<a id='line_2270'>  His wandering steps, and half-entranced laid</a>
<a id='line_2271'>  His head upon a tuft of straggling weeds,                     110</a>
<a id='line_2272'>  To taste the gentle moon, and freshening beads,</a>
<a id='line_2273'>  Lashed from the crystal roof by fishes' tails.</a>
<a id='line_2274'>  And so he kept, until the rosy veils</a>
<a id='line_2275'>  Mantling the east, by Aurora's peering hand</a>
<a id='line_2276'>  Were lifted from the water's breast, and faun'd</a>
<a id='line_2277'>  Into sweet air; and sober'd morning came</a>
<a id='line_2278'>  Meekly through billows:--when like taper-flame</a>
<a id='line_2279'>  Left sudden by a dallying breath of air,</a>
<a id='line_2280'>  He rose in silence, and once more 'gan fare</a>
<a id='line_2281'>  Along his fated way.                                          120</a>
<a id='line_2282'></a>
<a id='line_2283'>                        Far had he roam'd,</a>

<a id='line_2285'>  Above, around, and at his feet; save things</a>
<a id='line_2286'>  More dead than Morpheus' imaginings:</a>
<a id='line_2287'>  Old rusted anchors, helmets, breast-plates large</a>

<a id='line_2289'>  Rudders that for a hundred years had lost</a>
<a id='line_2290'>  The sway of human hand; gold vase emboss'd</a>

<a id='line_2292'>  No reveller had ever dipp'd a chin                            130</a>
<a id='line_2293'>  But those of Saturn's vintage; mouldering scrolls,</a>
<a id='line_2294'>  Writ in the tongue of heaven, by those souls</a>
<a id='line_2295'>  Who first were on the earth; and sculptures rude</a>
<a id='line_2296'>  In ponderous stone, developing the mood</a>
<a id='line_2297'>  Of ancient Nox;--then skeletons of man,</a>
<a id='line_2298'>  Of beast, behemoth, and leviathan,</a>
<a id='line_2299'>  And elephant, and eagle, and huge jaw</a>
<a id='line_2300'>  Of nameless monster. A cold leaden awe</a>
<a id='line_2301'>  These secrets struck into him; and unless</a>

<a id='line_2303'>  He might have died: but now, with cheered feel,</a>
<a id='line_2304'>  He onward kept; wooing these thoughts to steal</a>
<a id='line_2305'>  About the labyrinth in his soul of love.</a>
<a id='line_2306'></a>
<a id='line_2307'>    "What is there in thee, Moon! that thou shouldst move</a>

<a id='line_2314'>  No tumbling water ever spake romance,</a>
<a id='line_2315'>  But when my eyes with thine thereon could dance:</a>
<a id='line_2316'>  No woods were green enough, no bower divine,</a>
<a id='line_2317'>  Until thou liftedst up thine eyelids fine:</a>
<a id='line_2318'>  In sowing time ne'er would I dibble take,</a>
<a id='line_2319'>  Or drop a seed, till thou wast wide awake;</a>
<a id='line_2320'>  And, in the summer tide of blossoming,</a>
<a id='line_2321'>  No one but thee hath heard me blithly sing</a>
<a id='line_2322'>  And mesh my dewy flowers all the night.</a>
<a id='line_2323'>  No melody was like a passing spright                          160</a>
<a id='line_2324'>  If it went not to solemnize thy reign.</a>
<a id='line_2325'>  Yes, in my boyhood, every joy and pain</a>
<a id='line_2326'>  By thee were fashion'd to the self-same end;</a>
<a id='line_2327'>  And as I grew in years, still didst thou blend</a>
<a id='line_2328'>  With all my ardours: thou wast the deep glen;</a>
<a id='line_2329'>  Thou wast the mountain-top--the sage's pen--</a>
<a id='line_2330'>  The poet's harp--the voice of friends--the sun;</a>
<a id='line_2331'>  Thou wast the river--thou wast glory won;</a>
<a id='line_2332'>  Thou wast my clarion's blast--thou wast my steed--</a>
<a id='line_2333'>  My goblet full of wine--my topmost deed:--                    170</a>
<a id='line_2334'>  Thou wast the charm of women, lovely Moon!</a>
<a id='line_2335'>  O what a wild and harmonized tune</a>
<a id='line_2336'>  My spirit struck from all the beautiful!</a>
<a id='line_2337'>  On some bright essence could I lean, and lull</a>
<a id='line_2338'>  Myself to immortality: I prest</a>
<a id='line_2339'>  Nature's soft pillow in a wakeful rest.</a>
<a id='line_2340'>  But, gentle Orb! there came a nearer bliss--</a>
<a id='line_2341'>  My strange love came--Felicity's abyss!</a>
<a id='line_2342'>  She came, and thou didst fade, and fade away--</a>
<a id='line_2343'>  Yet not entirely; no, thy starry sway                         180</a>
<a id='line_2344'>  Has been an under-passion to this hour.</a>
<a id='line_2345'>  Now I begin to feel thine orby power</a>
<a id='line_2346'>  Is coming fresh upon me: O be kind,</a>
<a id='line_2347'>  Keep back thine influence, and do not blind</a>
<a id='line_2348'>  My sovereign vision.--Dearest love, forgive</a>
<a id='line_2349'>  That I can think away from thee and live!--</a>
<a id='line_2350'>  Pardon me, airy planet, that I prize</a>
<a id='line_2351'>  One thought beyond thine argent luxuries!</a>
<a id='line_2352'>  How far beyond!" At this a surpris'd start</a>
<a id='line_2353'>  Frosted the springing verdure of his heart;                   190</a>
<a id='line_2354'>  For as he lifted up his eyes to swear</a>
<a id='line_2355'>  How his own goddess was past all things fair,</a>
<a id='line_2356'>  He saw far in the concave green of the sea</a>
<a id='line_2357'>  An old man sitting calm and peacefully.</a>
<a id='line_2358'>  Upon a weeded rock this old man sat,</a>
<a id='line_2359'>  And his white hair was awful, and a mat</a>
<a id='line_2360'>  Of weeds were cold beneath his cold thin feet;</a>
<a id='line_2361'>  And, ample as the largest winding-sheet,</a>
<a id='line_2362'>  A cloak of blue wrapp'd up his aged bones,</a>
<a id='line_2363'>  O'erwrought with symbols by the deepest groans                200</a>
<a id='line_2364'>  Of ambitious magic: every ocean-form</a>
<a id='line_2365'>  Was woven in with black distinctness; storm,</a>
<a id='line_2366'>  And calm, and whispering, and hideous roar</a>
<a id='line_2367'>  Were emblem'd in the woof; with every shape</a>
<a id='line_2368'>  That skims, or dives, or sleeps, 'twixt cape and cape.</a>
<a id='line_2369'>  The gulphing whale was like a dot in the spell,</a>
<a id='line_2370'>  Yet look upon it, and 'twould size and swell</a>
<a id='line_2371'>  To its huge self; and the minutest fish</a>
<a id='line_2372'>  Would pass the very hardest gazer's wish,</a>
<a id='line_2373'>  And shew his little eye's anatomy.                            210</a>
<a id='line_2374'>  Then there was pictur'd the regality</a>
<a id='line_2375'>  Of Neptune; and the sea nymphs round his state,</a>
<a id='line_2376'>  In beauteous vassalage, look up and wait.</a>
<a id='line_2377'>  Beside this old man lay a pearly wand,</a>
<a id='line_2378'>  And in his lap a book, the which he conn'd</a>
<a id='line_2379'>  So stedfastly, that the new denizen</a>
<a id='line_2380'>  Had time to keep him in amazed ken,</a>
<a id='line_2381'>  To mark these shadowings, and stand in awe.</a>
<a id='line_2382'></a>
<a id='line_2383'>    The old man rais'd his hoary head and saw</a>
<a id='line_2384'>  The wilder'd stranger--seeming not to see,                    220</a>
<a id='line_2385'>  His features were so lifeless. Suddenly</a>
<a id='line_2386'>  He woke as from a trance; his snow-white brows</a>
<a id='line_2387'>  Went arching up, and like two magic ploughs</a>
<a id='line_2388'>  Furrow'd deep wrinkles in his forehead large,</a>
<a id='line_2389'>  Which kept as fixedly as rocky marge,</a>
<a id='line_2390'>  Till round his wither'd lips had gone a smile.</a>
<a id='line_2391'>  Then up he rose, like one whose tedious toil</a>
<a id='line_2392'>  Had watch'd for years in forlorn hermitage,</a>
<a id='line_2393'>  Who had not from mid-life to utmost age</a>
<a id='line_2394'>  Eas'd in one accent his o'er-burden'd soul,                   230</a>
<a id='line_2395'>  Even to the trees. He rose: he grasp'd his stole,</a>
<a id='line_2396'>  With convuls'd clenches waving it abroad,</a>
<a id='line_2397'>  And in a voice of solemn joy, that aw'd</a>
<a id='line_2398'>  Echo into oblivion, he said:--</a>
<a id='line_2399'></a>
<a id='line_2400'>    "Thou art the man! Now shall I lay my head</a>
<a id='line_2401'>  In peace upon my watery pillow: now</a>
<a id='line_2402'>  Sleep will come smoothly to my weary brow.</a>
<a id='line_2403'>  O Jove! I shall be young again, be young!</a>
<a id='line_2404'>  O shell-borne Neptune, I am pierc'd and stung</a>
<a id='line_2405'>  With new-born life! What shall I do? Where go,                240</a>
<a id='line_2406'>  When I have cast this serpent-skin of woe?--</a>
<a id='line_2407'>  I'll swim to the syrens, and one moment listen</a>
<a id='line_2408'>  Their melodies, and see their long hair glisten;</a>
<a id='line_2409'>  Anon upon that giant's arm I'll be,</a>
<a id='line_2410'>  That writhes about the roots of Sicily:</a>
<a id='line_2411'>  To northern seas I'll in a twinkling sail,</a>
<a id='line_2412'>  And mount upon the snortings of a whale</a>
<a id='line_2413'>  To some black cloud; thence down I'll madly sweep</a>
<a id='line_2414'>  On forked lightning, to the deepest deep,</a>
<a id='line_2415'>  Where through some sucking pool I will be hurl'd              250</a>
<a id='line_2416'>  With rapture to the other side of the world!</a>
<a id='line_2417'>  O, I am full of gladness! Sisters three,</a>
<a id='line_2418'>  I bow full hearted to your old decree!</a>
<a id='line_2419'>  Yes, every god be thank'd, and power benign,</a>
<a id='line_2420'>  For I no more shall wither, droop, and pine.</a>
<a id='line_2421'>  Thou art the man!" Endymion started back</a>
<a id='line_2422'>  Dismay'd; and, like a wretch from whom the rack</a>
<a id='line_2423'>  Tortures hot breath, and speech of agony,</a>
<a id='line_2424'>  Mutter'd: "What lonely death am I to die</a>
<a id='line_2425'>  In this cold region? Will he let me freeze,                   260</a>
<a id='line_2426'>  And float my brittle limbs o'er polar seas?</a>
<a id='line_2427'>  Or will he touch me with his searing hand,</a>
<a id='line_2428'>  And leave a black memorial on the sand?</a>
<a id='line_2429'>  Or tear me piece-meal with a bony saw,</a>
<a id='line_2430'>  And keep me as a chosen food to draw</a>
<a id='line_2431'>  His magian fish through hated fire and flame?</a>
<a id='line_2432'>  O misery of hell! resistless, tame,</a>
<a id='line_2433'>  Am I to be burnt up? No, I will shout,</a>
<a id='line_2434'>  Until the gods through heaven's blue look out!--</a>
<a id='line_2435'>  O Tartarus! but some few days agone                           270</a>
<a id='line_2436'>  Her soft arms were entwining me, and on</a>
<a id='line_2437'>  Her voice I hung like fruit among green leaves:</a>
<a id='line_2438'>  Her lips were all my own, and--ah, ripe sheaves</a>
<a id='line_2439'>  Of happiness! ye on the stubble droop,</a>
<a id='line_2440'>  But never may be garner'd. I must stoop</a>
<a id='line_2441'>  My head, and kiss death's foot. Love! love, farewel!</a>
<a id='line_2442'>  Is there no hope from thee? This horrid spell</a>
<a id='line_2443'>  Would melt at thy sweet breath.--By Dian's hind</a>
<a id='line_2444'>  Feeding from her white fingers, on the wind</a>
<a id='line_2445'>  I see thy streaming hair! and now, by Pan,                    280</a>
<a id='line_2446'>  I care not for this old mysterious man!"</a>
<a id='line_2447'></a>
<a id='line_2448'>    He spake, and walking to that aged form,</a>
<a id='line_2449'>  Look'd high defiance. Lo! his heart 'gan warm</a>
<a id='line_2450'>  With pity, for the grey-hair'd creature wept.</a>
<a id='line_2451'>  Had he then wrong'd a heart where sorrow kept?</a>
<a id='line_2452'>  Had he, though blindly contumelious, brought</a>
<a id='line_2453'>  Rheum to kind eyes, a sting to human thought,</a>
<a id='line_2454'>  Convulsion to a mouth of many years?</a>
<a id='line_2455'>  He had in truth; and he was ripe for tears.</a>
<a id='line_2456'>  The penitent shower fell, as down he knelt                    290</a>
<a id='line_2457'>  Before that care-worn sage, who trembling felt</a>
<a id='line_2458'>  About his large dark locks, and faultering spake:</a>
<a id='line_2459'></a>
<a id='line_2460'>    "Arise, good youth, for sacred PhÅbus' sake!</a>
<a id='line_2461'>  I know thine inmost bosom, and I feel</a>
<a id='line_2462'>  A very brother's yearning for thee steal</a>
<a id='line_2463'>  Into mine own: for why? thou openest</a>
<a id='line_2464'>  The prison gates that have so long opprest</a>
<a id='line_2465'>  My weary watching. Though thou know'st it not,</a>
<a id='line_2466'>  Thou art commission'd to this fated spot</a>
<a id='line_2467'>  For great enfranchisement. O weep no more;                    300</a>
<a id='line_2468'>  I am a friend to love, to loves of yore:</a>
<a id='line_2469'>  Aye, hadst thou never lov'd an unknown power,</a>
<a id='line_2470'>  I had been grieving at this joyous hour.</a>
<a id='line_2471'>  But even now most miserable old,</a>
<a id='line_2472'>  I saw thee, and my blood no longer cold</a>
<a id='line_2473'>  Gave mighty pulses: in this tottering case</a>
<a id='line_2474'>  Grew a new heart, which at this moment plays</a>
<a id='line_2475'>  As dancingly as thine. Be not afraid,</a>
<a id='line_2476'>  For thou shalt hear this secret all display'd,</a>
<a id='line_2477'>  Now as we speed towards our joyous task."                     310</a>
<a id='line_2478'></a>
<a id='line_2479'>    So saying, this young soul in age's mask</a>
<a id='line_2480'>  Went forward with the Carian side by side:</a>
<a id='line_2481'>  Resuming quickly thus; while ocean's tide</a>
<a id='line_2482'>  Hung swollen at their backs, and jewel'd sands</a>
<a id='line_2483'>  Took silently their foot-prints.</a>
<a id='line_2484'></a>
<a id='line_2485'>                                   "My soul stands</a>

<a id='line_2487'>  And so I can prepare without a sigh</a>
<a id='line_2488'>  To tell thee briefly all my joy and pain.</a>
<a id='line_2489'>  I was a fisher once, upon this main,                          320</a>
<a id='line_2490'>  And my boat danc'd in every creek and bay;</a>
<a id='line_2491'>  Rough billows were my home by night and day,--</a>
<a id='line_2492'>  The sea-gulls not more constant; for I had</a>
<a id='line_2493'>  No housing from the storm and tempests mad,</a>
<a id='line_2494'>  But hollow rocks,--and they were palaces</a>
<a id='line_2495'>  Of silent happiness, of slumberous ease:</a>
<a id='line_2496'>  Long years of misery have told me so.</a>
<a id='line_2497'>  Aye, thus it was one thousand years ago.</a>
<a id='line_2498'>  One thousand years!--Is it then possible</a>
<a id='line_2499'>  To look so plainly through them? to dispel                    330</a>
<a id='line_2500'>  A thousand years with backward glance sublime?</a>
<a id='line_2501'>  To breathe away as 'twere all scummy slime</a>
<a id='line_2502'>  From off a crystal pool, to see its deep,</a>
<a id='line_2503'>  And one's own image from the bottom peep?</a>
<a id='line_2504'>  Yes: now I am no longer wretched thrall,</a>
<a id='line_2505'>  My long captivity and moanings all</a>
<a id='line_2506'>  Are but a slime, a thin-pervading scum,</a>
<a id='line_2507'>  The which I breathe away, and thronging come</a>
<a id='line_2508'>  Like things of yesterday my youthful pleasures.</a>
<a id='line_2509'></a>
<a id='line_2510'>    "I touch'd no lute, I sang not, trod no measures:</a>
<a id='line_2511'>  I was a lonely youth on desert shores.                        341</a>
<a id='line_2512'>  My sports were lonely, 'mid continuous roars,</a>
<a id='line_2513'>  And craggy isles, and sea-mew's plaintive cry</a>

<a id='line_2515'>  Dolphins were still my playmates; shapes unseen</a>

<a id='line_2518'>  When a dread waterspout had rear'd aloft</a>
<a id='line_2519'>  Its hungry hugeness, seeming ready ripe</a>
<a id='line_2520'>  To burst with hoarsest thunderings, and wipe                  350</a>
<a id='line_2521'>  My life away like a vast sponge of fate,</a>

<a id='line_2525'>  Of all my life was utmost quietude:</a>
<a id='line_2526'>  More did I love to lie in cavern rude,</a>
<a id='line_2527'>  Keeping in wait whole days for Neptune's voice,</a>
<a id='line_2528'>  And if it came at last, hark, and rejoice!</a>
<a id='line_2529'>  There blush'd no summer eve but I would steer</a>
<a id='line_2530'>  My skiff along green shelving coasts, to hear                 360</a>

<a id='line_2536'>  Heaven's gates, and Ãthon snort his morning gold</a>
<a id='line_2537'>  Wide o'er the swelling streams: and constantly</a>
<a id='line_2538'>  At brim of day-tide, on some grassy lea,</a>

<a id='line_2540'>  The poor folk of the sea-country I blest                      370</a>
<a id='line_2541'>  With daily boon of fish most delicate:</a>
<a id='line_2542'>  They knew not whence this bounty, and elate</a>

<a id='line_2559'>  Forgetful utterly of self-intent;</a>
<a id='line_2560'>  Moving but with the mighty ebb and flow.</a>

<a id='line_2562'>  His spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,</a>

<a id='line_2593'>  Just when the light of morn, with hum of bees,</a>
<a id='line_2594'>  Stole through its verdurous matting of fresh trees.</a>
<a id='line_2595'>  How sweet, and sweeter! for I heard a lyre,</a>
<a id='line_2596'>  And over it a sighing voice expire.</a>
<a id='line_2597'>  It ceased--I caught light footsteps; and anon</a>
<a id='line_2598'>  The fairest face that morn e'er look'd upon</a>

<a id='line_2601'>  A net whose thraldom was more bliss than all</a>
<a id='line_2602'>  The range of flower'd Elysium. Thus did fall                  430</a>
<a id='line_2603'>  The dew of her rich speech: "Ah! Art awake?</a>

<a id='line_2612'>  Such cool and sorrowful offerings, thou art fond              440</a>

<a id='line_2618'>  Her charming syllables, till indistinct</a>
<a id='line_2619'>  Their music came to my o'er-sweeten'd soul;</a>
<a id='line_2620'>  And then she hover'd over me, and stole</a>

<a id='line_2662'>  Wandering about in pine and cedar gloom</a>
<a id='line_2663'>  Damp awe assail'd me; for there 'gan to boom</a>

<a id='line_2665'>  Sepulchral from the distance all around.</a>
<a id='line_2666'>  Then came a conquering earth-thunder, and rumbled             490</a>
<a id='line_2667'>  That fierce complain to silence: while I stumbled</a>
<a id='line_2668'>  Down a precipitous path, as if impell'd.</a>

<a id='line_2680'>  Laughing, and wailing, groveling, serpenting,</a>

<a id='line_2703'>  Shrieks, yells, and groans of torture-pilgrimage;</a>
<a id='line_2704'>  Until their grieved bodies 'gan to bloat</a>

<a id='line_2707'>  More wildering than all that hoarse affright;</a>
<a id='line_2708'>  For the whole herd, as by a whirlwind writhen,</a>

<a id='line_2869'>  Each Atlas-line bore off!--a shine of hope</a>
<a id='line_2870'>  Came gold around me, cheering me to cope                      690</a>
<a id='line_2871'>  Strenuous with hellish tyranny. Attend!</a>
<a id='line_2872'>  For thou hast brought their promise to an end.</a>

<a id='line_2877'>  And then to die alone. Who can devise</a>
<a id='line_2878'>  A total opposition? No one. So</a>
<a id='line_2879'>  One million times ocean must ebb and flow,</a>

<a id='line_2890'>  He shall deposit side by side, until</a>
<a id='line_2891'>  Time's creeping shall the dreary space fulfil:_               710</a>
<a id='line_2892'>  _Which done, and all these labours ripened,</a>

<a id='line_2896'>  Must do the thing, or both will be destroy'd._"--</a>
<a id='line_2897'></a>
<a id='line_2898'>    "Then," cried the young Endymion, overjoy'd,</a>
<a id='line_2899'>  "We are twin brothers in this destiny!</a>

<a id='line_2909'>  Throughout my bondage." Thus discoursing, on</a>
<a id='line_2910'>  They went till unobscur'd the porches shone;</a>
<a id='line_2911'>  Which hurryingly they gain'd, and enter'd straight.</a>
<a id='line_2912'>  Sure never since king Neptune held his state                  730</a>

<a id='line_2916'>  How every soldier, with firm foot, doth hold</a>
<a id='line_2917'>  His even breast: see, many steeled squares,</a>
<a id='line_2918'>  And rigid ranks of iron--whence who dares</a>
<a id='line_2919'>  One step? Imagine further, line by line,</a>
<a id='line_2920'>  These warrior thousands on the field supine:--</a>
<a id='line_2921'>  So in that crystal place, in silent rows,</a>
<a id='line_2922'>  Poor lovers lay at rest from joys and woes.--                 740</a>
<a id='line_2923'>  The stranger from the mountains, breathless, trac'd</a>
<a id='line_2924'>  Such thousands of shut eyes in order plac'd;</a>
<a id='line_2925'>  Such ranges of white feet, and patient lips</a>
<a id='line_2926'>  All ruddy,--for here death no blossom nips.</a>
<a id='line_2927'>  He mark'd their brows and foreheads; saw their hair</a>
<a id='line_2928'>  Put sleekly on one side with nicest care;</a>
<a id='line_2929'>  And each one's gentle wrists, with reverence,</a>
<a id='line_2930'>  Put cross-wise to its heart.</a>
<a id='line_2931'></a>
<a id='line_2932'>                                "Let us commence,</a>

<a id='line_2934'>  He spake, and, trembling like an aspen-bough,</a>
<a id='line_2935'>  Began to tear his scroll in pieces small,</a>
<a id='line_2936'>  Uttering the while some mumblings funeral.</a>
<a id='line_2937'>  He tore it into pieces small as snow</a>
<a id='line_2938'>  That drifts unfeather'd when bleak northerns blow;</a>
<a id='line_2939'>  And having done it, took his dark blue cloak</a>
<a id='line_2940'>  And bound it round Endymion: then struck</a>
<a id='line_2941'>  His wand against the empty air times nine.--</a>
<a id='line_2942'>  "What more there is to do, young man, is thine:</a>
<a id='line_2943'>  But first a little patience; first undo                       760</a>
<a id='line_2944'>  This tangled thread, and wind it to a clue.</a>
<a id='line_2945'>  Ah, gentle! 'tis as weak as spider's skein;</a>
<a id='line_2946'>  And shouldst thou break it--What, is it done so clean?</a>
<a id='line_2947'>  A power overshadows thee! Oh, brave!</a>
<a id='line_2948'>  The spite of hell is tumbling to its grave.</a>
<a id='line_2949'>  Here is a shell; 'tis pearly blank to me,</a>

<a id='line_2952'>  Olympus! we are safe! Now, Carian, break</a>
<a id='line_2953'>  This wand against yon lyre on the pedestal."                  770</a>
<a id='line_2954'></a>
<a id='line_2955'>    'Twas done: and straight with sudden swell and fall</a>
<a id='line_2956'>  Sweet music breath'd her soul away, and sigh'd</a>
<a id='line_2957'>  A lullaby to silence.--"Youth! now strew</a>
<a id='line_2958'>  These minced leaves on me, and passing through</a>
<a id='line_2959'>  Those files of dead, scatter the same around,</a>
<a id='line_2960'>  And thou wilt see the issue."--'Mid the sound</a>
<a id='line_2961'>  Of flutes and viols, ravishing his heart,</a>
<a id='line_2962'>  Endymion from Glaucus stood apart,</a>
<a id='line_2963'>  And scatter'd in his face some fragments light.</a>
<a id='line_2964'>  How lightning-swift the change! a youthful wight              780</a>
<a id='line_2965'>  Smiling beneath a coral diadem,</a>
<a id='line_2966'>  Out-sparkling sudden like an upturn'd gem,</a>
<a id='line_2967'>  Appear'd, and, stepping to a beauteous corse,</a>
<a id='line_2968'>  Kneel'd down beside it, and with tenderest force</a>
<a id='line_2969'>  Press'd its cold hand, and wept,--and Scylla sigh'd!</a>
<a id='line_2970'>  Endymion, with quick hand, the charm applied--</a>
<a id='line_2971'>  The nymph arose: he left them to their joy,</a>
<a id='line_2972'>  And onward went upon his high employ,</a>
<a id='line_2973'>  Showering those powerful fragments on the dead.</a>
<a id='line_2974'>  And, as he pass'd, each lifted up its head,                   790</a>
<a id='line_2975'>  As doth a flower at Apollo's touch.</a>
<a id='line_2976'>  Death felt it to his inwards: 'twas too much:</a>
<a id='line_2977'>  Death fell a weeping in his charnel-house.</a>
<a id='line_2978'>  The Latmian persever'd along, and thus</a>
<a id='line_2979'>  All were re-animated. There arose</a>
<a id='line_2980'>  A noise of harmony, pulses and throes</a>
<a id='line_2981'>  Of gladness in the air--while many, who</a>
<a id='line_2982'>  Had died in mutual arms devout and true,</a>
<a id='line_2983'>  Sprang to each other madly; and the rest</a>
<a id='line_2984'>  Felt a high certainty of being blest.                         800</a>
<a id='line_2985'>  They gaz'd upon Endymion. Enchantment</a>
<a id='line_2986'>  Grew drunken, and would have its head and bent.</a>
<a id='line_2987'>  Delicious symphonies, like airy flowers,</a>
<a id='line_2988'>  Budded, and swell'd, and, full-blown, shed full showers</a>
<a id='line_2989'>  Of light, soft, unseen leaves of sounds divine.</a>
<a id='line_2990'>  The two deliverers tasted a pure wine</a>
<a id='line_2991'>  Of happiness, from fairy-press ooz'd out.</a>
<a id='line_2992'>  Speechless they eyed each other, and about</a>
<a id='line_2993'>  The fair assembly wander'd to and fro,</a>
<a id='line_2994'>  Distracted with the richest overflow                          810</a>
<a id='line_2995'>  Of joy that ever pour'd from heaven.</a>
<a id='line_2996'></a>
<a id='line_2997'>                                  ----"Away!"</a>
<a id='line_2998'>  Shouted the new born god; "Follow, and pay</a>
<a id='line_2999'>  Our piety to Neptunus supreme!"--</a>
<a id='line_3000'>  Then Scylla, blushing sweetly from her dream,</a>
<a id='line_3001'>  They led on first, bent to her meek surprise,</a>
<a id='line_3002'>  Though portal columns of a giant size,</a>
<a id='line_3003'>  Into the vaulted, boundless emerald.</a>
<a id='line_3004'>  Joyous all follow'd, as the leader call'd,</a>
<a id='line_3005'>  Down marble steps; pouring as easily                          820</a>
<a id='line_3006'>  As hour-glass sand,--and fast, as you might see</a>
<a id='line_3007'>  Swallows obeying the south summer's call,</a>
<a id='line_3008'>  Or swans upon a gentle waterfall.</a>
<a id='line_3009'></a>
<a id='line_3010'>    Thus went that beautiful multitude, nor far,</a>
<a id='line_3011'>  Ere from among some rocks of glittering spar,</a>
<a id='line_3012'>  Just within ken, they saw descending thick</a>
<a id='line_3013'>  Another multitude. Whereat more quick</a>
<a id='line_3014'>  Moved either host. On a wide sand they met,</a>
<a id='line_3015'>  And of those numbers every eye was wet;</a>
<a id='line_3016'>  For each their old love found. A murmuring rose,              830</a>
<a id='line_3017'>  Like what was never heard in all the throes</a>
<a id='line_3018'>  Of wind and waters: 'tis past human wit</a>
<a id='line_3019'>  To tell; 'tis dizziness to think of it.</a>
<a id='line_3020'></a>
<a id='line_3021'>    This mighty consummation made, the host</a>
<a id='line_3022'>  Mov'd on for many a league; and gain'd, and lost</a>
<a id='line_3023'>  Huge sea-marks; vanward swelling in array,</a>
<a id='line_3024'>  And from the rear diminishing away,--</a>
<a id='line_3025'>  Till a faint dawn surpris'd them. Glaucus cried,</a>
<a id='line_3026'>  "Behold! behold, the palace of his pride!</a>
<a id='line_3027'>  God Neptune's palaces!" With noise increas'd,                 840</a>
<a id='line_3028'>  They shoulder'd on towards that brightening cast.</a>
<a id='line_3029'>  At every onward step proud domes arose</a>
<a id='line_3030'>  In prospect,--diamond gleams, and golden glows</a>
<a id='line_3031'>  Of amber 'gainst their faces levelling.</a>
<a id='line_3032'>  Joyous, and many as the leaves in spring,</a>
<a id='line_3033'>  Still onward; still the splendour gradual swell'd.</a>
<a id='line_3034'>  Rich opal domes were seen, on high upheld</a>
<a id='line_3035'>  By jasper pillars, letting through their shafts</a>
<a id='line_3036'>  A blush of coral. Copious wonder-draughts</a>
<a id='line_3037'>  Each gazer drank; and deeper drank more near:                 850</a>
<a id='line_3038'>  For what poor mortals fragment up, as mere</a>
<a id='line_3039'>  As marble was there lavish, to the vast</a>
<a id='line_3040'>  Of one fair palace, that far far surpass'd,</a>
<a id='line_3041'>  Even for common bulk, those olden three,</a>
<a id='line_3042'>  Memphis, and Babylon, and Nineveh.</a>
<a id='line_3043'></a>
<a id='line_3044'>    As large, as bright, as colour'd as the bow</a>
<a id='line_3045'>  Of Iris, when unfading it doth shew</a>
<a id='line_3046'>  Beyond a silvery shower, was the arch</a>
<a id='line_3047'>  Through which this Paphian army took its march,</a>
<a id='line_3048'>  Into the outer courts of Neptune's state:                     860</a>
<a id='line_3049'>  Whence could be seen, direct, a golden gate,</a>
<a id='line_3050'>  To which the leaders sped; but not half raught</a>
<a id='line_3051'>  Ere it burst open swift as fairy thought,</a>
<a id='line_3052'>  And made those dazzled thousands veil their eyes</a>
<a id='line_3053'>  Like callow eagles at the first sunrise.</a>
<a id='line_3054'>  Soon with an eagle nativeness their gaze</a>
<a id='line_3055'>  Ripe from hue-golden swoons took all the blaze,</a>
<a id='line_3056'>  And then, behold! large Neptune on his throne</a>
<a id='line_3057'>  Of emerald deep: yet not exalt alone;</a>
<a id='line_3058'>  At his right hand stood winged Love, and on                   870</a>
<a id='line_3059'>  His left sat smiling Beauty's paragon.</a>
<a id='line_3060'></a>
<a id='line_3061'>    Far as the mariner on highest mast</a>
<a id='line_3062'>  Can see all round upon the calmed vast,</a>
<a id='line_3063'>  So wide was Neptune's hall: and as the blue</a>
<a id='line_3064'>  Doth vault the waters, so the waters drew</a>
<a id='line_3065'>  Their doming curtains, high, magnificent,</a>
<a id='line_3066'>  Aw'd from the throne aloof;--and when storm-rent</a>
<a id='line_3067'>  Disclos'd the thunder-gloomings in Jove's air;</a>
<a id='line_3068'>  But sooth'd as now, flash'd sudden everywhere,</a>
<a id='line_3069'>  Noiseless, sub-marine cloudlets, glittering                   880</a>
<a id='line_3070'>  Death to a human eye: for there did spring</a>
<a id='line_3071'>  From natural west, and east, and south, and north,</a>
<a id='line_3072'>  A light as of four sunsets, blazing forth</a>
<a id='line_3073'>  A gold-green zenith 'bove the Sea-God's head.</a>
<a id='line_3074'>  Of lucid depth the floor, and far outspread</a>
<a id='line_3075'>  As breezeless lake, on which the slim canoe</a>
<a id='line_3076'>  Of feather'd Indian darts about, as through</a>
<a id='line_3077'>  The delicatest air: air verily,</a>
<a id='line_3078'>  But for the portraiture of clouds and sky:</a>
<a id='line_3079'>  This palace floor breath-air,--but for the amaze              890</a>
<a id='line_3080'>  Of deep-seen wonders motionless,--and blaze</a>
<a id='line_3081'>  Of the dome pomp, reflected in extremes,</a>
<a id='line_3082'>  Globing a golden sphere.</a>
<a id='line_3083'></a>
<a id='line_3084'>                            They stood in dreams</a>
<a id='line_3085'>  Till Triton blew his horn. The palace rang;</a>
<a id='line_3086'>  The Nereids danc'd; the Syrens faintly sang;</a>
<a id='line_3087'>  And the great Sea-King bow'd his dripping head.</a>
<a id='line_3088'>  Then Love took wing, and from his pinions shed</a>
<a id='line_3089'>  On all the multitude a nectarous dew.</a>
<a id='line_3090'>  The ooze-born Goddess beckoned and drew                       900</a>
<a id='line_3091'>  Fair Scylla and her guides to conference;</a>
<a id='line_3092'>  And when they reach'd the throned eminence</a>
<a id='line_3093'>  She kist the sea-nymph's cheek,--who sat her down</a>
<a id='line_3094'>  A toying with the doves. Then,--"Mighty crown</a>
<a id='line_3095'>  And sceptre of this kingdom!" Venus said,</a>
<a id='line_3096'>  "Thy vows were on a time to Nais paid:</a>
<a id='line_3097'>  Behold!"--Two copious tear-drops instant fell</a>
<a id='line_3098'>  From the God's large eyes; he smil'd delectable,</a>
<a id='line_3099'>  And over Glaucus held his blessing hands.--</a>
<a id='line_3100'>  "Endymion! Ah! still wandering in the bands                   910</a>

<a id='line_3105'>  A little patience, youth! 'twill not be long,</a>

<a id='line_3107'>  A humid eye, and steps luxurious,</a>
<a id='line_3108'>  Where these are new and strange, are ominous.</a>
<a id='line_3109'>  Aye, I have seen these signs in one of heaven,</a>

<a id='line_3119'>  Thus the fair goddess: while Endymion</a>
<a id='line_3120'>  Knelt to receive those accents halcyon.                       930</a>
<a id='line_3121'></a>
<a id='line_3122'>    Meantime a glorious revelry began</a>
<a id='line_3123'>  Before the Water-Monarch. Nectar ran</a>
<a id='line_3124'>  In courteous fountains to all cups outreach'd;</a>
<a id='line_3125'>  And plunder'd vines, teeming exhaustless, pleach'd</a>
<a id='line_3126'>  New growth about each shell and pendent lyre;</a>

<a id='line_3129'>  For dainty toying. Cupid, empire-sure,</a>
<a id='line_3130'>  Flutter'd and laugh'd, and oft-times through the throng</a>
<a id='line_3131'>  Made a delighted way. Then dance, and song,                   940</a>
<a id='line_3132'>  And garlanding grew wild; and pleasure reign'd.</a>
<a id='line_3133'>  In harmless tendril they each other chain'd,</a>

<a id='line_3253'>  Muse of my native land! loftiest Muse!</a>
<a id='line_3254'>  O first-born on the mountains! by the hues</a>
<a id='line_3255'>  Of heaven on the spiritual air begot:</a>
<a id='line_3256'>  Long didst thou sit alone in northern grot,</a>
<a id='line_3257'>  While yet our England was a wolfish den;</a>

<a id='line_3259'>  Before the first of Druids was a child;--</a>
<a id='line_3260'>  Long didst thou sit amid our regions wild</a>
<a id='line_3261'>  Rapt in a deep prophetic solitude.</a>
<a id='line_3262'>  There came an eastern voice of solemn mood:--                  10</a>
<a id='line_3263'>  Yet wast thou patient. Then sang forth the Nine,</a>
<a id='line_3264'>  Apollo's garland:--yet didst thou divine</a>
<a id='line_3265'>  Such home-bred glory, that they cry'd in vain,</a>
<a id='line_3266'>  "Come hither, Sister of the Island!" Plain</a>
<a id='line_3267'>  Spake fair Ausonia; and once more she spake</a>
<a id='line_3268'>  A higher summons:--still didst thou betake</a>
<a id='line_3269'>  Thee to thy native hopes. O thou hast won</a>
<a id='line_3270'>  A full accomplishment! The thing is done,</a>
<a id='line_3271'>  Which undone, these our latter days had risen</a>
<a id='line_3272'>  On barren souls. Great Muse, thou know'st what prison,</a>
<a id='line_3273'>  Of flesh and bone, curbs, and confines, and frets              21</a>
<a id='line_3274'>  Our spirit's wings: despondency besets</a>
<a id='line_3275'>  Our pillows; and the fresh to-morrow morn</a>
<a id='line_3276'>  Seems to give forth its light in very scorn</a>
<a id='line_3277'>  Of our dull, uninspired, snail-paced lives.</a>
<a id='line_3278'>  Long have I said, how happy he who shrives</a>
<a id='line_3279'>  To thee! But then I thought on poets gone,</a>
<a id='line_3280'>  And could not pray:--nor can I now--so on</a>

<a id='line_3285'>  Glad was the hour, when, with thee, myriads bade</a>

<a id='line_3287'>  To one so friendless the clear freshet yields</a>
<a id='line_3288'>  A bitter coolness; the ripe grape is sour:</a>

<a id='line_3338'>  Melodious howsoever, can confound</a>
<a id='line_3339'>  The heavens and earth in one to such a death</a>
<a id='line_3340'>  As doth the voice of love: there's not a breath</a>
<a id='line_3341'>  Will mingle kindly with the meadow air,</a>
<a id='line_3342'>  Till it has panted round, and stolen a share</a>
<a id='line_3343'>  Of passion from the heart!"--</a>
<a id='line_3344'></a>
<a id='line_3345'>                                Upon a bough</a>
<a id='line_3346'>  He leant, wretched. He surely cannot now</a>
<a id='line_3347'>  Thirst for another love: O impious,</a>
<a id='line_3348'>  That he can even dream upon it thus!--                         90</a>
<a id='line_3349'>  Thought he, "Why am I not as are the dead,</a>
<a id='line_3350'>  Since to a woe like this I have been led</a>
<a id='line_3351'>  Through the dark earth, and through the wondrous sea?</a>
<a id='line_3352'>  Goddess! I love thee not the less: from thee</a>
<a id='line_3353'>  By Juno's smile I turn not--no, no, no--</a>
<a id='line_3354'>  While the great waters are at ebb and flow.--</a>
<a id='line_3355'>  I have a triple soul! O fond pretence--</a>
<a id='line_3356'>  For both, for both my love is so immense,</a>
<a id='line_3357'>  I feel my heart is cut in twain for them."</a>
<a id='line_3358'></a>
<a id='line_3359'>    And so he groan'd, as one by beauty slain.                  100</a>
<a id='line_3360'>  The lady's heart beat quick, and he could see</a>
<a id='line_3361'>  Her gentle bosom heave tumultuously.</a>
<a id='line_3362'>  He sprang from his green covert: there she lay,</a>
<a id='line_3363'>  Sweet as a muskrose upon new-made hay;</a>
<a id='line_3364'>  With all her limbs on tremble, and her eyes</a>
<a id='line_3365'>  Shut softly up alive. To speak he tries.</a>
<a id='line_3366'>  "Fair damsel, pity me! forgive that I</a>
<a id='line_3367'>  Thus violate thy bower's sanctity!</a>
<a id='line_3368'>  O pardon me, for I am full of grief--</a>
<a id='line_3369'>  Grief born of thee, young angel! fairest thief!               110</a>
<a id='line_3370'>  Who stolen hast away the wings wherewith</a>

<a id='line_3372'>  Thou art my executioner, and I feel</a>
<a id='line_3373'>  Loving and hatred, misery and weal,</a>
<a id='line_3374'>  Will in a few short hours be nothing to me,</a>

<a id='line_3376'>  Do smile upon the evening of my days:</a>
<a id='line_3377'>  And, for my tortur'd brain begins to craze,</a>
<a id='line_3378'>  Be thou my nurse; and let me understand</a>
<a id='line_3379'>  How dying I shall kiss that lily hand.--                      120</a>
<a id='line_3380'>  Dost weep for me? Then should I be content.</a>
<a id='line_3381'>  Scowl on, ye fates! until the firmament</a>
<a id='line_3382'>  Outblackens Erebus, and the full-cavern'd earth</a>
<a id='line_3383'>  Crumbles into itself. By the cloud girth</a>
<a id='line_3384'>  Of Jove, those tears have given me a thirst</a>
<a id='line_3385'>  To meet oblivion."--As her heart would burst</a>
<a id='line_3386'>  The maiden sobb'd awhile, and then replied:</a>
<a id='line_3387'>  "Why must such desolation betide</a>
<a id='line_3388'>  As that thou speakest of? Are not these green nooks</a>
<a id='line_3389'>  Empty of all misfortune? Do the brooks                        130</a>
<a id='line_3390'>  Utter a gorgon voice? Does yonder thrush,</a>
<a id='line_3391'>  Schooling its half-fledg'd little ones to brush</a>

<a id='line_3393'>  Speak not of grief, young stranger, or cold snails</a>

<a id='line_3395'>  Methinks 'twould be a guilt--a very guilt--</a>
<a id='line_3396'>  Not to companion thee, and sigh away</a>

<a id='line_3398'>  "Dear lady," said Endymion, "'tis past:</a>

<a id='line_3695'>  A Jovian thunderbolt: arch Hebe brings</a>
<a id='line_3696'>  A full-brimm'd goblet, dances lightly, sings</a>
<a id='line_3697'>  And tantalizes long; at last he drinks,</a>
<a id='line_3698'>  And lost in pleasure at her feet he sinks,                    420</a>

<a id='line_3721'>  Of his delicious lady. He who died</a>
<a id='line_3722'>  For soaring too audacious in the sun,</a>
<a id='line_3723'>  Where that same treacherous wax began to run,</a>
<a id='line_3724'>  Felt not more tongue-tied than Endymion.</a>
<a id='line_3725'>  His heart leapt up as to its rightful throne,</a>
<a id='line_3726'>  To that fair shadow'd passion puls'd its way--</a>
<a id='line_3727'>  Ah, what perplexity! Ah, well a day!</a>
<a id='line_3728'>  So fond, so beauteous was his bed-fellow,                     450</a>
<a id='line_3729'>  He could not help but kiss her: then he grew</a>
<a id='line_3730'>  Awhile forgetful of all beauty save</a>
<a id='line_3731'>  Young PhÅbe's, golden hair'd; and so 'gan crave</a>
<a id='line_3732'>  Forgiveness: yet he turn'd once more to look</a>
<a id='line_3733'>  At the sweet sleeper,--all his soul was shook,--</a>
<a id='line_3734'>  She press'd his hand in slumber; so once more</a>
<a id='line_3735'>  He could not help but kiss her and adore.</a>
<a id='line_3736'>  At this the shadow wept, melting away.</a>
<a id='line_3737'>  The Latmian started up: "Bright goddess, stay!</a>
<a id='line_3738'>  Search my most hidden breast! By truth's own tongue,</a>
<a id='line_3739'>  I have no dÃ¦dale heart: why is it wrung                       461</a>
<a id='line_3740'>  To desperation? Is there nought for me,</a>
<a id='line_3741'>  Upon the bourne of bliss, but misery?"</a>
<a id='line_3742'></a>
<a id='line_3743'>    These words awoke the stranger of dark tresses:</a>
<a id='line_3744'>  Her dawning love-look rapt Endymion blesses</a>
<a id='line_3745'>  With 'haviour soft. Sleep yawned from underneath.</a>
<a id='line_3746'>  "Thou swan of Ganges, let us no more breathe</a>
<a id='line_3747'>  This murky phantasm! thou contented seem'st</a>
<a id='line_3748'>  Pillow'd in lovely idleness, nor dream'st</a>
<a id='line_3749'>  What horrors may discomfort thee and me.                      470</a>
<a id='line_3750'>  Ah, shouldst thou die from my heart-treachery!--</a>
<a id='line_3751'>  Yet did she merely weep--her gentle soul</a>
<a id='line_3752'>  Hath no revenge in it: as it is whole</a>
<a id='line_3753'>  In tenderness, would I were whole in love!</a>
<a id='line_3754'>  Can I prize thee, fair maid, till price above,</a>
<a id='line_3755'>  Even when I feel as true as innocence?</a>
<a id='line_3756'>  I do, I do.--What is this soul then? Whence</a>
<a id='line_3757'>  Came it? It does not seem my own, and I</a>
<a id='line_3758'>  Have no self-passion or identity.</a>
<a id='line_3759'>  Some fearful end must be: where, where is it?                 480</a>
<a id='line_3760'>  By Nemesis, I see my spirit flit</a>
<a id='line_3761'>  Alone about the dark--Forgive me, sweet:</a>
<a id='line_3762'>  Shall we away?" He rous'd the steeds: they beat</a>
<a id='line_3763'>  Their wings chivalrous into the clear air,</a>
<a id='line_3764'>  Leaving old Sleep within his vapoury lair.</a>
<a id='line_3765'></a>
<a id='line_3766'>    The good-night blush of eve was waning slow,</a>
<a id='line_3767'>  And Vesper, risen star, began to throe</a>
<a id='line_3768'>  In the dusk heavens silvery, when they</a>
<a id='line_3769'>  Thus sprang direct towards the Galaxy.</a>
<a id='line_3770'>  Nor did speed hinder converse soft and strange--              490</a>
<a id='line_3771'>  Eternal oaths and vows they interchange,</a>
<a id='line_3772'>  In such wise, in such temper, so aloof</a>
<a id='line_3773'>  Up in the winds, beneath a starry roof,</a>
<a id='line_3774'>  So witless of their doom, that verily</a>
<a id='line_3775'>  'Tis well nigh past man's search their hearts to see;</a>
<a id='line_3776'>  Whether they wept, or laugh'd, or griev'd, or toy'd--</a>

<a id='line_3778'></a>
<a id='line_3779'>    Fell facing their swift flight, from ebon streak,</a>
<a id='line_3780'>  The moon put forth a little diamond peak,</a>
<a id='line_3781'>  No bigger than an unobserved star,                            500</a>
<a id='line_3782'>  Or tiny point of fairy scymetar;</a>
<a id='line_3783'>  Bright signal that she only stoop'd to tie</a>
<a id='line_3784'>  Her silver sandals, ere deliciously</a>
<a id='line_3785'>  She bow'd into the heavens her timid head.</a>
<a id='line_3786'>  Slowly she rose, as though she would have fled,</a>
<a id='line_3787'>  While to his lady meek the Carian turn'd,</a>
<a id='line_3788'>  To mark if her dark eyes had yet discern'd</a>
<a id='line_3789'>  This beauty in its birth--Despair! despair!</a>
<a id='line_3790'>  He saw her body fading gaunt and spare</a>
<a id='line_3791'>  In the cold moonshine. Straight he seiz'd her wrist;</a>
<a id='line_3792'>  It melted from his grasp: her hand he kiss'd,                 511</a>
<a id='line_3793'>  And, horror! kiss'd his own--he was alone.</a>
<a id='line_3794'>  Her steed a little higher soar'd, and then</a>
<a id='line_3795'>  Dropt hawkwise to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_3796'></a>
<a id='line_3797'>                               There lies a den,</a>
<a id='line_3798'>  Beyond the seeming confines of the space</a>
<a id='line_3799'>  Made for the soul to wander in and trace</a>
<a id='line_3800'>  Its own existence, of remotest glooms.</a>
<a id='line_3801'>  Dark regions are around it, where the tombs</a>
<a id='line_3802'>  Of buried griefs the spirit sees, but scarce                  520</a>
<a id='line_3803'>  One hour doth linger weeping, for the pierce</a>
<a id='line_3804'>  Of new-born woe it feels more inly smart:</a>
<a id='line_3805'>  And in these regions many a venom'd dart</a>
<a id='line_3806'>  At random flies; they are the proper home</a>
<a id='line_3807'>  Of every ill: the man is yet to come</a>
<a id='line_3808'>  Who hath not journeyed in this native hell.</a>
<a id='line_3809'>  But few have ever felt how calm and well</a>
<a id='line_3810'>  Sleep may be had in that deep den of all.</a>
<a id='line_3811'>  There anguish does not sting; nor pleasure pall:</a>
<a id='line_3812'>  Woe-hurricanes beat ever at the gate,                         530</a>
<a id='line_3813'>  Yet all is still within and desolate.</a>
<a id='line_3814'>  Beset with plainful gusts, within ye hear</a>
<a id='line_3815'>  No sound so loud as when on curtain'd bier</a>
<a id='line_3816'>  The death-watch tick is stifled. Enter none</a>
<a id='line_3817'>  Who strive therefore: on the sudden it is won.</a>
<a id='line_3818'>  Just when the sufferer begins to burn,</a>
<a id='line_3819'>  Then it is free to him; and from an urn,</a>
<a id='line_3820'>  Still fed by melting ice, he takes a draught--</a>
<a id='line_3821'>  Young Semele such richness never quaft</a>
<a id='line_3822'>  In her maternal longing. Happy gloom!                         540</a>
<a id='line_3823'>  Dark Paradise! where pale becomes the bloom</a>
<a id='line_3824'>  Of health by due; where silence dreariest</a>

<a id='line_3826'>  Where those eyes are the brightest far that keep</a>
<a id='line_3827'>  Their lids shut longest in a dreamless sleep.</a>
<a id='line_3828'>  O happy spirit-home! O wondrous soul!</a>
<a id='line_3829'>  Pregnant with such a den to save the whole</a>
<a id='line_3830'>  In thine own depth. Hail, gentle Carian!</a>
<a id='line_3831'>  For, never since thy griefs and woes began,</a>
<a id='line_3832'>  Hast thou felt so content: a grievous feud                    550</a>
<a id='line_3833'>  Hath let thee to this Cave of Quietude.</a>
<a id='line_3834'>  Aye, his lull'd soul was there, although upborne</a>
<a id='line_3835'>  With dangerous speed: and so he did not mourn</a>
<a id='line_3836'>  Because he knew not whither he was going.</a>
<a id='line_3837'>  So happy was he, not the aerial blowing</a>
<a id='line_3838'>  Of trumpets at clear parley from the east</a>
<a id='line_3839'>  Could rouse from that fine relish, that high feast.</a>
<a id='line_3840'>  They stung the feather'd horse: with fierce alarm</a>
<a id='line_3841'>  He flapp'd towards the sound. Alas, no charm</a>

<a id='line_3843'>  A skyey mask, a pinion'd multitude,--</a>
<a id='line_3844'>  And silvery was its passing: voices sweet</a>
<a id='line_3845'>  Warbling the while as if to lull and greet</a>
<a id='line_3846'>  The wanderer in his path. Thus warbled they,</a>

<a id='line_3848'></a>
<a id='line_3849'>    "Who, who from Dian's feast would be away?</a>

<a id='line_3983'>  And thou shall feed them from the squirrel's barn.</a>
<a id='line_3984'>  Its bottom will I strew with amber shells,</a>

<a id='line_3999'>  Heaven shield thee for thine utter loveliness!</a>
<a id='line_4000'>  Thy mossy footstool shall the altar be</a>
<a id='line_4001'>  'Fore which I'll bend, bending, dear love, to thee:</a>
<a id='line_4002'>  Those lips shall be my Delphos, and shall speak</a>

<a id='line_4004'>  Trembling or stedfastness to this same voice,</a>
<a id='line_4005'>  And of three sweetest pleasurings the choice:                 720</a>

<a id='line_4007'>  Those eyes, those passions, those supreme pearl springs,</a>

<a id='line_4012'>                              The mountaineer</a>
<a id='line_4013'>  Thus strove by fancies vain and crude to clear</a>
<a id='line_4014'>  His briar'd path to some tranquillity.</a>
<a id='line_4015'>  It gave bright gladness to his lady's eye,</a>
<a id='line_4016'>  And yet the tears she wept were tears of sorrow;              730</a>
<a id='line_4017'>  Answering thus, just as the golden morrow</a>
<a id='line_4018'>  Beam'd upward from the vallies of the east:</a>
<a id='line_4019'>  "O that the flutter of this heart had ceas'd,</a>
<a id='line_4020'>  Or the sweet name of love had pass'd away.</a>
<a id='line_4021'>  Young feathor'd tyrant! by a swift decay</a>

<a id='line_4027'>  Art thou not cruel? Ever have I striven</a>
<a id='line_4028'>  To think thee kind, but ah, it will not do!</a>
<a id='line_4029'>  When yet a child, I heard that kisses drew</a>
<a id='line_4030'>  Favour from thee, and so I gave and gave</a>
<a id='line_4031'>  To the void air, bidding them find out love:</a>
<a id='line_4032'>  But when I came to feel how far above</a>
<a id='line_4033'>  All fancy, pride, and fickle maidenhood,</a>
<a id='line_4034'>  All earthly pleasure, all imagin'd good,</a>
<a id='line_4035'>  Was the warm tremble of a devout kiss,--</a>
<a id='line_4036'>  Even then, that moment, at the thought of this,               750</a>
<a id='line_4037'>  Fainting I fell into a bed of flowers,</a>
<a id='line_4038'>  And languish'd there three days. Ye milder powers,</a>
<a id='line_4039'>  Am I not cruelly wrong'd? Believe, believe</a>
<a id='line_4040'>  Me, dear Endymion, were I to weave</a>
<a id='line_4041'>  With my own fancies garlands of sweet life,</a>
<a id='line_4042'>  Thou shouldst be one of all. Ah, bitter strife!</a>
<a id='line_4043'>  I may not be thy love: I am forbidden--</a>
<a id='line_4044'>  Indeed I am--thwarted, affrighted, chidden,</a>
<a id='line_4045'>  By things I trembled at, and gorgon wrath.</a>
<a id='line_4046'>  Twice hast thou ask'd whither I went: henceforth              760</a>
<a id='line_4047'>  Ask me no more! I may not utter it,</a>
<a id='line_4048'>  Nor may I be thy love. We might commit</a>
<a id='line_4049'>  Ourselves at once to vengeance; we might die;</a>
<a id='line_4050'>  We might embrace and die: voluptuous thought!</a>
<a id='line_4051'>  Enlarge not to my hunger, or I'm caught</a>
<a id='line_4052'>  In trammels of perverse deliciousness.</a>
<a id='line_4053'>  No, no, that shall not be: thee will I bless,</a>

<a id='line_4070'>  Yes, moonlight Emperor! felicity</a>
<a id='line_4071'>  Has been thy meed for many thousand years;</a>
<a id='line_4072'>  Yet often have I, on the brink of tears,</a>

<a id='line_4081'>  A little onward ran the very stream</a>

<a id='line_4084'>  A crescent he had carv'd, and round it spent</a>

<a id='line_4090'>  He had not with his tamed leopards play'd;</a>

<a id='line_4132'>  To shepherds and their flocks; and furthermore,</a>
<a id='line_4133'>  In Dian's face they read the gentle lore:</a>
<a id='line_4134'>  Therefore for her these vesper-carols are.</a>
<a id='line_4135'>  Our friends will all be there from nigh and far.</a>
<a id='line_4136'>  Many upon thy death have ditties made;</a>
<a id='line_4137'>  And many, even now, their foreheads shade</a>
<a id='line_4138'>  With cypress, on a day of sacrifice.</a>
<a id='line_4139'>  New singing for our maids shalt thou devise,</a>
<a id='line_4140'>  And pluck the sorrow from our huntsmen's brows.</a>
<a id='line_4141'>  Tell me, my lady-queen, how to espouse                        850</a>

<a id='line_4146'>  What ails thee?" He could bear no more, and so</a>
<a id='line_4147'>  Bent his soul fiercely like a spiritual bow,</a>
<a id='line_4148'>  And twang'd it inwardly, and calmly said:</a>
<a id='line_4149'>  "I would have thee my only friend, sweet maid!</a>
<a id='line_4150'>  My only visitor! not ignorant though,</a>
<a id='line_4151'>  That those deceptions which for pleasure go                   860</a>

<a id='line_4155'>  Since I saw thee, I have been wide awake</a>
<a id='line_4156'>  Night after night, and day by day, until</a>
<a id='line_4157'>  Of the empyrean I have drunk my fill.</a>
<a id='line_4158'>  Let it content thee, Sister, seeing me</a>
<a id='line_4159'>  More happy than betides mortality.</a>
<a id='line_4160'>  A hermit young, I'll live in mossy cave,</a>
<a id='line_4161'>  Where thou alone shalt come to me, and lave                   870</a>
<a id='line_4162'>  Thy spirit in the wonders I shall tell.</a>
<a id='line_4163'>  Through me the shepherd realm shall prosper well;</a>
<a id='line_4164'>  For to thy tongue will I all health confide.</a>
<a id='line_4165'>  And, for my sake, let this young maid abide</a>
<a id='line_4166'>  With thee as a dear sister. Thou alone,</a>
<a id='line_4167'>  Peona, mayst return to me. I own</a>
<a id='line_4168'>  This may sound strangely: but when, dearest girl,</a>
<a id='line_4169'>  Thou seest it for my happiness, no pearl</a>
<a id='line_4170'>  Will trespass down those cheeks. Companion fair!</a>
<a id='line_4171'>  Wilt be content to dwell with her, to share                   880</a>
<a id='line_4172'>  This sister's love with me?" Like one resign'd</a>
<a id='line_4173'>  And bent by circumstance, and thereby blind</a>
<a id='line_4174'>  In self-commitment, thus that meek unknown:</a>
<a id='line_4175'>  "Aye, but a buzzing by my ears has flown,</a>
<a id='line_4176'>  Of jubilee to Dian:--truth I heard!</a>
<a id='line_4177'>  Well then, I see there is no little bird,</a>
<a id='line_4178'>  Tender soever, but is Jove's own care.</a>
<a id='line_4179'>  Long have I sought for rest, and, unaware,</a>
<a id='line_4180'>  Behold I find it! so exalted too!</a>
<a id='line_4181'>  So after my own heart! I knew, I knew                         890</a>
<a id='line_4182'>  There was a place untenanted in it:</a>
<a id='line_4183'>  In that same void white Chastity shall sit,</a>
<a id='line_4184'>  And monitor me nightly to lone slumber.</a>
<a id='line_4185'>  With sanest lips I vow me to the number</a>
<a id='line_4186'>  Of Dian's sisterhood; and, kind lady,</a>
<a id='line_4187'>  With thy good help, this very night shall see</a>
<a id='line_4188'>  My future days to her fane consecrate."</a>
<a id='line_4189'></a>
<a id='line_4190'>    As feels a dreamer what doth most create</a>
<a id='line_4191'>  His own particular fright, so these three felt:</a>
<a id='line_4192'>  Or like one who, in after ages, knelt                         900</a>
<a id='line_4193'>  To Lucifer or Baal, when he'd pine</a>
<a id='line_4194'>  After a little sleep: or when in mine</a>
<a id='line_4195'>  Far under-ground, a sleeper meets his friends</a>
<a id='line_4196'>  Who know him not. Each diligently bends</a>
<a id='line_4197'>  Towards common thoughts and things for very fear;</a>
<a id='line_4198'>  Striving their ghastly malady to cheer,</a>
<a id='line_4199'>  By thinking it a thing of yes and no,</a>
<a id='line_4200'>  That housewives talk of. But the spirit-blow</a>
<a id='line_4201'>  Was struck, and all were dreamers. At the last</a>
<a id='line_4202'>  Endymion said: "Are not our fates all cast?                   910</a>
<a id='line_4203'>  Why stand we here? Adieu, ye tender pair!</a>
<a id='line_4204'>  Adieu!" Whereat those maidens, with wild stare,</a>
<a id='line_4205'>  Walk'd dizzily away. Pained and hot</a>
<a id='line_4206'>  His eyes went after them, until they got</a>
<a id='line_4207'>  Near to a cypress grove, whose deadly maw,</a>
<a id='line_4208'>  In one swift moment, would what then he saw</a>
<a id='line_4209'>  Engulph for ever. "Stay!" he cried, "ah, stay!</a>
<a id='line_4210'>  Turn, damsels! hist! one word I have to say.</a>
<a id='line_4211'>  Sweet Indian, I would see thee once again.</a>
<a id='line_4212'>  It is a thing I dote on: so I'd fain,                         920</a>
<a id='line_4213'>  Peona, ye should hand in hand repair</a>
<a id='line_4214'>  Into those holy groves, that silent are</a>
<a id='line_4215'>  Behind great Dian's temple. I'll be yon,</a>
<a id='line_4216'>  At vesper's earliest twinkle--they are gone--</a>
<a id='line_4217'>  But once, once, once again--" At this he press'd</a>
<a id='line_4218'>  His hands against his face, and then did rest</a>
<a id='line_4219'>  His head upon a mossy hillock green,</a>
<a id='line_4220'>  And so remain'd as he a corpse had been</a>
<a id='line_4221'>  All the long day; save when he scantly lifted</a>
<a id='line_4222'>  His eyes abroad, to see how shadows shifted                   930</a>
<a id='line_4223'>  With the slow move of time,--sluggish and weary</a>
<a id='line_4224'>  Until the poplar tops, in journey dreary,</a>
<a id='line_4225'>  Had reach'd the river's brim. Then up he rose,</a>
<a id='line_4226'>  And, slowly as that very river flows,</a>
<a id='line_4227'>  Walk'd towards the temple grove with this lament:</a>
<a id='line_4228'>  "Why such a golden eve? The breeze is sent</a>
<a id='line_4229'>  Careful and soft, that not a leaf may fall</a>
<a id='line_4230'>  Before the serene father of them all</a>
<a id='line_4231'>  Bows down his summer head below the west.</a>
<a id='line_4232'>  Now am I of breath, speech, and speed possest,                940</a>
<a id='line_4233'>  But at the setting I must bid adieu</a>
<a id='line_4234'>  To her for the last time. Night will strew</a>
<a id='line_4235'>  On the damp grass myriads of lingering leaves,</a>
<a id='line_4236'>  And with them shall I die; nor much it grieves</a>
<a id='line_4237'>  To die, when summer dies on the cold sward.</a>
<a id='line_4238'>  Why, I have been a butterfly, a lord</a>
<a id='line_4239'>  Of flowers, garlands, love-knots, silly posies,</a>
<a id='line_4240'>  Groves, meadows, melodies, and arbour roses;</a>
<a id='line_4241'>  My kingdom's at its death, and just it is</a>
<a id='line_4242'>  That I should die with it: so in all this                     950</a>
<a id='line_4243'>  We miscal grief, bale, sorrow, heartbreak, woe,</a>
<a id='line_4244'>  What is there to plain of? By Titan's foe</a>
<a id='line_4245'>  I am but rightly serv'd." So saying, he</a>
<a id='line_4246'>  Tripp'd lightly on, in sort of deathful glee;</a>
<a id='line_4247'>  Laughing at the clear stream and setting sun,</a>
<a id='line_4248'>  As though they jests had been: nor had he done</a>
<a id='line_4249'>  His laugh at nature's holy countenance,</a>
<a id='line_4250'>  Until that grove appear'd, as if perchance,</a>
<a id='line_4251'>  And then his tongue with sober seemlihed</a>
<a id='line_4252'>  Gave utterance as he entered: "Ha!" I said,                   960</a>
<a id='line_4253'>  "King of the butterflies; but by this gloom,</a>
<a id='line_4254'>  And by old Rhadamanthus' tongue of doom,</a>
<a id='line_4255'>  This dusk religion, pomp of solitude,</a>
<a id='line_4256'>  And the Promethean clay by thief endued,</a>
<a id='line_4257'>  By old Saturnus' forelock, by his head</a>
<a id='line_4258'>  Shook with eternal palsy, I did wed</a>
<a id='line_4259'>  Myself to things of light from infancy;</a>
<a id='line_4260'>  And thus to be cast out, thus lorn to die,</a>
<a id='line_4261'>  Is sure enough to make a mortal man</a>
<a id='line_4262'>  Grow impious." So he inwardly began                           970</a>
<a id='line_4263'>  On things for which no wording can be found;</a>
<a id='line_4264'>  Deeper and deeper sinking, until drown'd</a>
<a id='line_4265'>  Beyond the reach of music: for the choir</a>
<a id='line_4266'>  Of Cynthia he heard not, though rough briar</a>
<a id='line_4267'>  Nor muffling thicket interpos'd to dull</a>
<a id='line_4268'>  The vesper hymn, far swollen, soft and full,</a>
<a id='line_4269'>  Through the dark pillars of those sylvan aisles.</a>
<a id='line_4270'>  He saw not the two maidens, nor their smiles,</a>
<a id='line_4271'>  Wan as primroses gather'd at midnight</a>
<a id='line_4272'>  By chilly finger'd spring. "Unhappy wight!                    980</a>
<a id='line_4273'>  Endymion!" said Peona, "we are here!</a>
<a id='line_4274'>  What wouldst thou ere we all are laid on bier?"</a>
<a id='line_4275'>  Then he embrac'd her, and his lady's hand</a>
<a id='line_4276'>  Press'd, saying: "Sister, I would have command,</a>
<a id='line_4277'>  If it were heaven's will, on our sad fate."</a>
<a id='line_4278'>  At which that dark-eyed stranger stood elate</a>
<a id='line_4279'>  And said, in a new voice, but sweet as love,</a>
<a id='line_4280'>  To Endymion's amaze: "By Cupid's dove,</a>
<a id='line_4281'>  And so thou shalt! and by the lily truth</a>
<a id='line_4282'>  Of my own breast thou shalt, beloved youth!"                  990</a>
<a id='line_4283'>  And as she spake, into her face there came</a>
<a id='line_4284'>  Light, as reflected from a silver flame:</a>
<a id='line_4285'>  Her long black hair swell'd ampler, in display</a>
<a id='line_4286'>  Full golden; in her eyes a brighter day</a>
<a id='line_4287'>  Dawn'd blue and full of love. Aye, he beheld</a>
<a id='line_4288'>  PhÅbe, his passion! joyous she upheld</a>
<a id='line_4289'>  Her lucid bow, continuing thus: "Drear, drear</a>
<a id='line_4290'>  Has our delaying been; but foolish fear</a>
<a id='line_4291'>  Withheld me first; and then decrees of fate;</a>
<a id='line_4292'>  And then 'twas fit that from this mortal state               1000</a>
<a id='line_4293'>  Thou shouldst, my love, by some unlook'd for change</a>
<a id='line_4294'>  Be spiritualiz'd. Peona, we shall range</a>
<a id='line_4295'>  These forests, and to thee they safe shall be</a>
<a id='line_4296'>  As was thy cradle; hither shalt thou flee</a>
<a id='line_4297'>  To meet us many a time." Next Cynthia bright</a>
<a id='line_4298'>  Peona kiss'd, and bless'd with fair good night:</a>
<a id='line_4299'>  Her brother kiss'd her too, and knelt adown</a>
<a id='line_4300'>  Before his goddess, in a blissful swoon.</a>
<a id='line_4301'>  She gave her fair hands to him, and behold,</a>
<a id='line_4302'>  Before three swiftest kisses he had told,                    1010</a>
<a id='line_4303'>  They vanish'd far away!--Peona went</a>
<a id='line_4304'>  Home through the gloomy wood in wonderment.</a>
