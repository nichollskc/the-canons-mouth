<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'>     The State Of Germany Till The Invasion Of The Barbarians In The</a>
<a id='line_3'>     Time Of The Emperor Decius.</a>
<a id='line_4'></a>
<a id='line_5'>      The government and religion of Persia have deserved some notice,</a>
<a id='line_6'>      from their connection with the decline and fall of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_7'>      empire. We shall occasionally mention the Scythian or Sarmatian</a>
<a id='line_8'>      tribes, 1001 which, with their arms and horses, their flocks and</a>
<a id='line_9'>      herds, their wives and families, wandered over the immense plains</a>
<a id='line_10'>      which spread themselves from the Caspian Sea to the Vistula, from</a>
<a id='line_11'>      the confines of Persia to those of Germany. But the warlike</a>
<a id='line_12'>      Germans, who first resisted, then invaded, and at length</a>
<a id='line_13'>      overturned the Western monarchy of Rome, will occupy a much more</a>
<a id='line_14'>      important place in this history, and possess a stronger, and, if</a>
<a id='line_15'>      we may use the expression, a more domestic, claim to our</a>
<a id='line_16'>      attention and regard. The most civilized nations of modern Europe</a>
<a id='line_17'>      issued from the woods of Germany; and in the rude institutions of</a>
<a id='line_18'>      those barbarians we may still distinguish the original principles</a>
<a id='line_19'>      of our present laws and manners. In their primitive state of</a>
<a id='line_20'>      simplicity and independence, the Germans were surveyed by the</a>
<a id='line_21'>      discerning eye, and delineated by the masterly pencil, of</a>
<a id='line_22'>      Tacitus, 1002 the first of historians who applied the science of</a>
<a id='line_23'>      philosophy to the study of facts. The expressive conciseness of</a>
<a id='line_24'>      his descriptions has served to exercise the diligence of</a>
<a id='line_25'>      innumerable antiquarians, and to excite the genius and</a>
<a id='line_26'>      penetration of the philosophic historians of our own times. The</a>
<a id='line_27'>      subject, however various and important, has already been so</a>
<a id='line_28'>      frequently, so ably, and so successfully discussed, that it is</a>
<a id='line_29'>      now grown familiar to the reader, and difficult to the writer. We</a>
<a id='line_30'>      shall therefore content ourselves with observing, and indeed with</a>
<a id='line_31'>      repeating, some of the most important circumstances of climate,</a>
<a id='line_32'>      of manners, and of institutions, which rendered the wild</a>
<a id='line_33'>      barbarians of Germany such formidable enemies to the Roman power.</a>
<a id='line_34'></a>
<a id='line_35'>      1001 (return) [ The Scythians, even according to the ancients,</a>
<a id='line_36'>      are not Sarmatians. It may be doubted whether Gibbon intended to</a>
<a id='line_37'>      confound them.—M. ——The Greeks, after having divided the world</a>
<a id='line_38'>      into Greeks and barbarians. divided the barbarians into four</a>
<a id='line_39'>      great classes, the Celts, the Scythians, the Indians, and the</a>
<a id='line_40'>      Ethiopians. They called Celts all the inhabitants of Gaul.</a>
<a id='line_41'>      Scythia extended from the Baltic Sea to the Lake Aral: the people</a>
<a id='line_42'>      enclosed in the angle to the north-east, between Celtica and</a>
<a id='line_43'>      Scythia, were called Celto-Scythians, and the Sarmatians were</a>
<a id='line_44'>      placed in the southern part of that angle. But these names of</a>
<a id='line_45'>      Celts, of Scythians, of Celto-Scythians, and Sarmatians, were</a>
<a id='line_46'>      invented, says Schlozer, by the profound cosmographical ignorance</a>
<a id='line_47'>      of the Greeks, and have no real ground; they are purely</a>
<a id='line_48'>      geographical divisions, without any relation to the true</a>
<a id='line_49'>      affiliation of the different races. Thus all the inhabitants of</a>
<a id='line_50'>      Gaul are called Celts by most of the ancient writers; yet Gaul</a>
<a id='line_51'>      contained three totally distinct nations, the Belgæ, the</a>
<a id='line_52'>      Aquitani, and the Gauls, properly so called. Hi omnes lingua</a>
<a id='line_53'>      institutis, legibusque inter se differunt. Cæsar. Com. c. i. It</a>

<a id='line_72'>      1002 (return) [ The Germania of Tacitus has been a fruitful</a>
<a id='line_73'>      source of hypothesis to the ingenuity of modern writers, who have</a>
<a id='line_74'>      endeavored to account for the form of the work and the views of</a>
<a id='line_75'>      the author. According to Luden, (Geschichte des T. V. i. 432, and</a>
<a id='line_76'>      note,) it contains the unfinished and disarranged for a larger</a>
<a id='line_77'>      work. An anonymous writer, supposed by Luden to be M. Becker,</a>
<a id='line_78'>      conceives that it was intended as an episode in his larger</a>
<a id='line_79'>      history. According to M. Guizot, “Tacite a peint les Germains</a>
<a id='line_80'>      comme Montaigne et Rousseau les sauvages, dans un acces d’humeur</a>
<a id='line_81'>      contre sa patrie: son livre est une satire des mœurs Romaines,</a>

<a id='line_85'>      Civilisation Moderne, i. 258.—M.]</a>
<a id='line_86'></a>
<a id='line_87'>      Ancient Germany, excluding from its independent limits the</a>
<a id='line_88'>      province westward of the Rhine, which had submitted to the Roman</a>
<a id='line_89'>      yoke, extended itself over a third part of Europe. 1 Almost the</a>
<a id='line_90'>      whole of modern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland,</a>
<a id='line_91'>      Livonia, Prussia, and the greater part of Poland, were peopled by</a>
<a id='line_92'>      the various tribes of one great nation, whose complexion,</a>
<a id='line_93'>      manners, and language denoted a common origin, and preserved a</a>
<a id='line_94'>      striking resemblance. On the west, ancient Germany was divided by</a>
<a id='line_95'>      the Rhine from the Gallic, and on the south, by the Danube, from</a>
<a id='line_96'>      the Illyrian, provinces of the empire. A ridge of hills, rising</a>
<a id='line_97'>      from the Danube, and called the Carpathian Mountains, covered</a>
<a id='line_98'>      Germany on the side of Dacia or Hungary. The eastern frontier was</a>
<a id='line_99'>      faintly marked by the mutual fears of the Germans and the</a>
<a id='line_100'>      Sarmatians, and was often confounded by the mixture of warring</a>
<a id='line_101'>      and confederating tribes of the two nations. In the remote</a>
<a id='line_102'>      darkness of the north, the ancients imperfectly descried a frozen</a>
<a id='line_103'>      ocean that lay beyond the Baltic Sea, and beyond the Peninsula,</a>
<a id='line_104'>      or islands 1001a of Scandinavia.</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>      1 (return) [ Germany was not of such vast extent. It is from</a>
<a id='line_107'>      Cæsar, and more particularly from Ptolemy, (says Gatterer,) that</a>
<a id='line_108'>      we can know what was the state of ancient Germany before the wars</a>
<a id='line_109'>      with the Romans had changed the positions of the tribes. Germany,</a>
<a id='line_110'>      as changed by these wars, has been described by Strabo, Pliny,</a>
<a id='line_111'>      and Tacitus. Germany, properly so called, was bounded on the west</a>
<a id='line_112'>      by the Rhine, on the east by the Vistula, on the north by the</a>
<a id='line_113'>      southern point of Norway, by Sweden, and Esthonia. On the south,</a>
<a id='line_114'>      the Maine and the mountains to the north of Bohemia formed the</a>
<a id='line_115'>      limits. Before the time of Cæsar, the country between the Maine</a>
<a id='line_116'>      and the Danube was partly occupied by the Helvetians and other</a>
<a id='line_117'>      Gauls, partly by the Hercynian forest but, from the time of Cæsar</a>
<a id='line_118'>      to the great migration, these boundaries were advanced as far as</a>
<a id='line_119'>      the Danube, or, what is the same thing, to the Suabian Alps,</a>
<a id='line_120'>      although the Hercynian forest still occupied, from north to</a>
<a id='line_121'>      south, a space of nine days’ journey on both banks of the Danube.</a>
<a id='line_122'>      “Gatterer, Versuch einer all-gemeinen Welt-Geschichte,” p. 424,</a>
<a id='line_123'>      edit. de 1792. This vast country was far from being inhabited by</a>
<a id='line_124'>      a single nation divided into different tribes of the same origin.</a>
<a id='line_125'>      We may reckon three principal races, very distinct in their</a>
<a id='line_126'>      language, their origin, and their customs. 1. To the east, the</a>
<a id='line_127'>      Slaves or Vandals. 2. To the west, the Cimmerians or Cimbri. 3.</a>
<a id='line_128'>      Between the Slaves and Cimbrians, the Germans, properly so</a>
<a id='line_129'>      called, the Suevi of Tacitus. The South was inhabited, before</a>
<a id='line_130'>      Julius Cæsar, by nations of Gaulish origin, afterwards by the</a>
<a id='line_131'>      Suevi.—G. On the position of these nations, the German</a>
<a id='line_132'>      antiquaries differ. I. The Slaves, or Sclavonians, or Wendish</a>
<a id='line_133'>      tribes, according to Schlozer, were originally settled in parts</a>
<a id='line_134'>      of Germany unknown to the Romans, Mecklenburgh, Pomerania,</a>
<a id='line_135'>      Brandenburgh, Upper Saxony; and Lusatia. According to Gatterer,</a>
<a id='line_136'>      they remained to the east of the Theiss, the Niemen, and the</a>
<a id='line_137'>      Vistula, till the third century. The Slaves, according to</a>
<a id='line_138'>      Procopius and Jornandes, formed three great divisions. 1. The</a>
<a id='line_139'>      Venedi or Vandals, who took the latter name, (the Wenden,) having</a>
<a id='line_140'>      expelled the Vandals, properly so called, (a Suevian race, the</a>
<a id='line_141'>      conquerors of Africa,) from the country between the Memel and the</a>
<a id='line_142'>      Vistula. 2. The Antes, who inhabited between the Dneister and the</a>
<a id='line_143'>      Dnieper. 3. The Sclavonians, properly so called, in the north of</a>
<a id='line_144'>      Dacia. During the great migration, these races advanced into</a>
<a id='line_145'>      Germany as far as the Saal and the Elbe. The Sclavonian language</a>
<a id='line_146'>      is the stem from which have issued the Russian, the Polish, the</a>
<a id='line_147'>      Bohemian, and the dialects of Lusatia, of some parts of the duchy</a>
<a id='line_148'>      of Luneburgh, of Carniola, Carinthia, and Styria, &c.; those of</a>
<a id='line_149'>      Croatia, Bosnia, and Bulgaria. Schlozer, Nordische Geschichte, p.</a>
<a id='line_150'>      323, 335. II. The Cimbric race. Adelung calls by this name all</a>
<a id='line_151'>      who were not Suevi. This race had passed the Rhine, before the</a>
<a id='line_152'>      time of Cæsar, occupied Belgium, and are the Belgæ of Cæsar and</a>
<a id='line_153'>      Pliny. The Cimbrians also occupied the Isle of Jutland. The Cymri</a>
<a id='line_154'>      of Wales and of Britain are of this race. Many tribes on the</a>
<a id='line_155'>      right bank of the Rhine, the Guthini in Jutland, the Usipeti in</a>
<a id='line_156'>      Westphalia, the Sigambri in the duchy of Berg, were German</a>
<a id='line_157'>      Cimbrians. III. The Suevi, known in very early times by the</a>
<a id='line_158'>      Romans, for they are mentioned by L. Corn. Sisenna, who lived 123</a>
<a id='line_159'>      years before Christ, (Nonius v. Lancea.) This race, the real</a>
<a id='line_160'>      Germans, extended to the Vistula, and from the Baltic to the</a>
<a id='line_161'>      Hercynian forest. The name of Suevi was sometimes confined to a</a>
<a id='line_162'>      single tribe, as by Cæsar to the Catti. The name of the Suevi has</a>
<a id='line_163'>      been preserved in Suabia. These three were the principal races</a>
<a id='line_164'>      which inhabited Germany; they moved from east to west, and are</a>
<a id='line_165'>      the parent stem of the modern natives. But northern Europe,</a>
<a id='line_166'>      according to Schlozer, was not peopled by them alone; other</a>
<a id='line_167'>      races, of different origin, and speaking different languages,</a>
<a id='line_168'>      have inhabited and left descendants in these countries. The</a>
<a id='line_169'>      German tribes called themselves, from very remote times, by the</a>
<a id='line_170'>      generic name of Teutons, (Teuten, Deutschen,) which Tacitus</a>
<a id='line_171'>      derives from that of one of their gods, Tuisco. It appears more</a>
<a id='line_172'>      probable that it means merely men, people. Many savage nations</a>
<a id='line_173'>      have given themselves no other name. Thus the Laplanders call</a>
<a id='line_174'>      themselves Almag, people; the Samoiedes Nilletz, Nissetsch, men,</a>
<a id='line_175'>      &c. As to the name of Germans, (Germani,) Cæsar found it in use</a>
<a id='line_176'>      in Gaul, and adopted it as a word already known to the Romans.</a>
<a id='line_177'>      Many of the learned (from a passage of Tacitus, de Mor Germ. c.</a>
<a id='line_178'>      2) have supposed that it was only applied to the Teutons after</a>
<a id='line_179'>      Cæsar’s time; but Adelung has triumphantly refuted this opinion.</a>
<a id='line_180'>      The name of Germans is found in the Fasti Capitolini. See Gruter,</a>
<a id='line_181'>      Iscrip. 2899, in which the consul Marcellus, in the year of Rome</a>
<a id='line_182'>      531, is said to have defeated the Gauls, the Insubrians, and the</a>
<a id='line_183'>      Germans, commanded by Virdomar. See Adelung, Ælt. Geschichte der</a>

<a id='line_186'>      1001a (return) [ The modern philosophers of Sweden seem agreed</a>
<a id='line_187'>      that the waters of the Baltic gradually sink in a regular</a>
<a id='line_188'>      proportion, which they have ventured to estimate at half an inch</a>
<a id='line_189'>      every year. Twenty centuries ago the flat country of Scandinavia</a>
<a id='line_190'>      must have been covered by the sea; while the high lands rose</a>
<a id='line_191'>      above the waters, as so many islands of various forms and</a>
<a id='line_192'>      dimensions. Such, indeed, is the notion given us by Mela, Pliny,</a>
<a id='line_193'>      and Tacitus, of the vast countries round the Baltic. See in the</a>

<a id='line_195'>      Dalin’s History of Sweden, composed in the Swedish language. *</a>
<a id='line_196'>      Note: Modern geologists have rejected this theory of the</a>
<a id='line_197'>      depression of the Baltic, as inconsistent with recent</a>

<a id='line_202'></a>
<a id='line_203'>      Some ingenious writers 2 have suspected that Europe was much</a>
<a id='line_204'>      colder formerly than it is at present; and the most ancient</a>
<a id='line_205'>      descriptions of the climate of Germany tend exceedingly to</a>
<a id='line_206'>      confirm their theory. The general complaints of intense frost and</a>
<a id='line_207'>      eternal winter are perhaps little to be regarded, since we have</a>
<a id='line_208'>      no method of reducing to the accurate standard of the</a>
<a id='line_209'>      thermometer, the feelings, or the expressions, of an orator born</a>
<a id='line_210'>      in the happier regions of Greece or Asia. But I shall select two</a>
<a id='line_211'>      remarkable circumstances of a less equivocal nature. 1. The great</a>
<a id='line_212'>      rivers which covered the Roman provinces, the Rhine and the</a>
<a id='line_213'>      Danube, were frequently frozen over, and capable of supporting</a>
<a id='line_214'>      the most enormous weights. The barbarians, who often chose that</a>
<a id='line_215'>      severe season for their inroads, transported, without</a>
<a id='line_216'>      apprehension or danger, their numerous armies, their cavalry, and</a>
<a id='line_217'>      their heavy wagons, over a vast and solid bridge of ice. 3 Modern</a>
<a id='line_218'>      ages have not presented an instance of a like phenomenon. 2. The</a>
<a id='line_219'>      reindeer, that useful animal, from whom the savage of the North</a>
<a id='line_220'>      derives the best comforts of his dreary life, is of a</a>
<a id='line_221'>      constitution that supports, and even requires, the most intense</a>
<a id='line_222'>      cold. He is found on the rock of Spitzberg, within ten degrees of</a>
<a id='line_223'>      the Pole; he seems to delight in the snows of Lapland and</a>
<a id='line_224'>      Siberia: but at present he cannot subsist, much less multiply, in</a>
<a id='line_225'>      any country to the south of the Baltic. 4 In the time of Cæsar</a>
<a id='line_226'>      the reindeer, as well as the elk and the wild bull, was a native</a>
<a id='line_227'>      of the Hercynian forest, which then overshadowed a great part of</a>
<a id='line_228'>      Germany and Poland. 5 The modern improvements sufficiently</a>
<a id='line_229'>      explain the causes of the diminution of the cold. These immense</a>
<a id='line_230'>      woods have been gradually cleared, which intercepted from the</a>
<a id='line_231'>      earth the rays of the sun. 6 The morasses have been drained, and,</a>
<a id='line_232'>      in proportion as the soil has been cultivated, the air has become</a>
<a id='line_233'>      more temperate. Canada, at this day, is an exact picture of</a>
<a id='line_234'>      ancient Germany. Although situated in the same parallel with the</a>
<a id='line_235'>      finest provinces of France and England, that country experiences</a>
<a id='line_236'>      the most rigorous cold. The reindeer are very numerous, the</a>
<a id='line_237'>      ground is covered with deep and lasting snow, and the great river</a>
<a id='line_238'>      of St. Lawrence is regularly frozen, in a season when the waters</a>
<a id='line_239'>      of the Seine and the Thames are usually free from ice. 7</a>

<a id='line_891'>      to whom they devoted their arms and service. A noble emulation</a>
<a id='line_892'>      prevailed among the companions to obtain the first place in the</a>
<a id='line_893'>      esteem of their chief; amongst the chiefs, to acquire the</a>
<a id='line_894'>      greatest number of valiant companions. To be ever surrounded by a</a>
<a id='line_895'>      band of select youths was the pride and strength of the chiefs,</a>
<a id='line_896'>      their ornament in peace, their defence in war. The glory of such</a>
<a id='line_897'>      distinguished heroes diffused itself beyond the narrow limits of</a>
<a id='line_898'>      their own tribe. Presents and embassies solicited their</a>
<a id='line_899'>      friendship, and the fame of their arms often insured victory to</a>
<a id='line_900'>      the party which they espoused. In the hour of danger it was</a>
<a id='line_901'>      shameful for the chief to be surpassed in valor by his</a>
<a id='line_902'>      companions; shameful for the companions not to equal the valor of</a>
<a id='line_903'>      their chief. To survive his fall in battle was indelible infamy.</a>
<a id='line_904'>      To protect his person, and to adorn his glory with the trophies</a>
<a id='line_905'>      of their own exploits, were the most sacred of their duties. The</a>
<a id='line_906'>      chiefs combated for victory, the companions for the chief. The</a>
<a id='line_907'>      noblest warriors, whenever their native country was sunk into the</a>
<a id='line_908'>      laziness of peace, maintained their numerous bands in some</a>
<a id='line_909'>      distant scene of action, to exercise their restless spirit, and</a>
<a id='line_910'>      to acquire renown by voluntary dangers. Gifts worthy of</a>
<a id='line_911'>      soldiers—the warlike steed, the bloody and ever victorious</a>
<a id='line_912'>      lance—were the rewards which the companions claimed from the</a>
<a id='line_913'>      liberality of their chief. The rude plenty of his hospitable</a>
<a id='line_914'>      board was the only pay that _he_ could bestow, or _they_ would</a>
<a id='line_915'>      accept. War, rapine, and the free-will offerings of his friends,</a>

<a id='line_975'>      barbarians were secured by poverty, solitude, and the painful</a>
<a id='line_976'>      cares of a domestic life. The German huts, open, on every side,</a>
<a id='line_977'>      to the eye of indiscretion or jealousy, were a better safeguard</a>
<a id='line_978'>      of conjugal fidelity than the walls, the bolts, and the eunuchs</a>
<a id='line_979'>      of a Persian harem. To this reason another may be added of a more</a>
<a id='line_980'>      honorable nature. The Germans treated their women with esteem and</a>
<a id='line_981'>      confidence, consulted them on every occasion of importance, and</a>
<a id='line_982'>      fondly believed, that in their breasts resided a sanctity and</a>
<a id='line_983'>      wisdom more than human. Some of the interpreters of fate, such as</a>
<a id='line_984'>      Velleda, in the Batavian war, governed, in the name of the deity,</a>
<a id='line_985'>      the fiercest nations of Germany. 58 The rest of the sex, without</a>
<a id='line_986'>      being adored as goddesses, were respected as the free and equal</a>
<a id='line_987'>      companions of soldiers; associated even by the marriage ceremony</a>
<a id='line_988'>      to a life of toil, of danger, and of glory. 59 In their great</a>
<a id='line_989'>      invasions, the camps of the barbarians were filled with a</a>
<a id='line_990'>      multitude of women, who remained firm and undaunted amidst the</a>
<a id='line_991'>      sound of arms, the various forms of destruction, and the</a>
<a id='line_992'>      honorable wounds of their sons and husbands. 60 Fainting armies</a>
<a id='line_993'>      of Germans have, more than once, been driven back upon the enemy</a>
<a id='line_994'>      by the generous despair of the women, who dreaded death much less</a>
<a id='line_995'>      than servitude. If the day was irrecoverably lost, they well knew</a>
<a id='line_996'>      how to deliver themselves and their children, with their own</a>
<a id='line_997'>      hands, from an insulting victor. 61 Heroines of such a cast may</a>

<a id='line_1200'>      observed, with ingenuity, and not without truth, that the command</a>

<a id='line_1202'>      tribes of Germany, alike destitute of both those valuable metals,</a>
<a id='line_1203'>      were reduced slowly to acquire, by their unassisted strength, the</a>
<a id='line_1204'>      possession of the one as well as the other. The face of a German</a>
<a id='line_1205'>      army displayed their poverty of iron. Swords, and the longer kind</a>
<a id='line_1206'>      of lances, they could seldom use. Their _frameæ_ (as they called</a>
<a id='line_1207'>      them in their own language) were long spears headed with a sharp</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      but narrow iron point, and which, as occasion required, they</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      either darted from a distance, or pushed in close onset. With</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      this spear, and with a shield, their cavalry was contented. A</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      multitude of darts, scattered 72 with incredible force, were an</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      additional resource of the infantry. Their military dress, when</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      they wore any, was nothing more than a loose mantle. A variety of</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      colors was the only ornament of their wooden or osier shields.</a>
<a id='line_1215'>      Few of the chiefs were distinguished by cuirasses, scarcely any</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      by helmets. Though the horses of Germany were neither beautiful,</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      swift, nor practised in the skilful evolutions of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      manege, several of the nations obtained renown by their cavalry;</a>
<a id='line_1219'>      but, in general, the principal strength of the Germans consisted</a>
<a id='line_1220'>      in their infantry, 73 which was drawn up in several deep columns,</a>
<a id='line_1221'>      according to the distinction of tribes and families. Impatient of</a>
<a id='line_1222'>      fatigue and delay, these half-armed warriors rushed to battle</a>
<a id='line_1223'>      with dissonant shouts and disordered ranks; and sometimes, by the</a>
<a id='line_1224'>      effort of native valor, prevailed over the constrained and more</a>
<a id='line_1225'>      artificial bravery of the Roman mercenaries. But as the</a>
<a id='line_1226'>      barbarians poured forth their whole souls on the first onset,</a>
<a id='line_1227'>      they knew not how to rally or to retire. A repulse was a sure</a>
<a id='line_1228'>      defeat; and a defeat was most commonly total destruction. When we</a>
<a id='line_1229'>      recollect the complete armor of the Roman soldiers, their</a>
<a id='line_1230'>      discipline, exercises, evolutions, fortified camps, and military</a>
<a id='line_1231'>      engines, it appears a just matter of surprise, how the naked and</a>
<a id='line_1232'>      unassisted valor of the barbarians could dare to encounter, in</a>
<a id='line_1233'>      the field, the strength of the legions, and the various troops of</a>
<a id='line_1234'>      the auxiliaries, which seconded their operations. The contest was</a>
<a id='line_1235'>      too unequal, till the introduction of luxury had enervated the</a>
<a id='line_1236'>      vigor, and a spirit of disobedience and sedition had relaxed the</a>
<a id='line_1237'>      discipline, of the Roman armies. The introduction of barbarian</a>
<a id='line_1238'>      auxiliaries into those armies, was a measure attended with very</a>
<a id='line_1239'>      obvious dangers, as it might gradually instruct the Germans in</a>
<a id='line_1240'>      the arts of war and of policy. Although they were admitted in</a>
<a id='line_1241'>      small numbers and with the strictest precaution, the example of</a>
<a id='line_1242'>      Civilis was proper to convince the Romans, that the danger was</a>
<a id='line_1243'>      not imaginary, and that their precautions were not always</a>
<a id='line_1244'>      sufficient. 74 During the civil wars that followed the death of</a>
<a id='line_1245'>      Nero, that artful and intrepid Batavian, whom his enemies</a>
<a id='line_1246'>      condescended to compare with Hannibal and Sertorius, 75 formed a</a>
<a id='line_1247'>      great design of freedom and ambition. Eight Batavian cohorts</a>
<a id='line_1248'>      renowned in the wars of Britain and Italy, repaired to his</a>

<a id='line_1283'>      concerting or executing any plan of national greatness, was</a>
<a id='line_1284'>      agitated by various and often hostile intentions. Germany was</a>
<a id='line_1285'>      divided into more than forty independent states; and, even in</a>
<a id='line_1286'>      each state, the union of the several tribes was extremely loose</a>

<a id='line_1288'>      not how to forgive an injury, much less an insult; their</a>
<a id='line_1289'>      resentments were bloody and implacable. The casual disputes that</a>
<a id='line_1290'>      so frequently happened in their tumultuous parties of hunting or</a>

<a id='line_1297'>      awful distance preserved by their neighbors attested the terror</a>
