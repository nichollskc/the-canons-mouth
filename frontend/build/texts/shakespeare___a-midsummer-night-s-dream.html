<a id='line_71'>THESEUS.</a>
<a id='line_72'>Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour</a>
<a id='line_73'>Draws on apace; four happy days bring in</a>
<a id='line_74'>Another moon; but oh, methinks, how slow</a>
<a id='line_75'>This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,</a>
<a id='line_76'>Like to a step-dame or a dowager,</a>

<a id='line_84'>Of our solemnities.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>THESEUS.</a>
<a id='line_87'>Go, Philostrate,</a>
<a id='line_88'>Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;</a>
<a id='line_89'>Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;</a>
<a id='line_90'>Turn melancholy forth to funerals;</a>
<a id='line_91'>The pale companion is not for our pomp.</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>

<a id='line_94'></a>
<a id='line_95'>Hippolyta, I woo’d thee with my sword,</a>

<a id='line_97'>But I will wed thee in another key,</a>
<a id='line_98'>With pomp, with triumph, and with revelling.</a>
<a id='line_99'></a>
<a id='line_100'> Enter Egeus, Hermia, Lysander and Demetrius.</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>EGEUS.</a>
<a id='line_103'>Happy be Theseus, our renownèd Duke!</a>
<a id='line_104'></a>
<a id='line_105'>THESEUS.</a>
<a id='line_106'>Thanks, good Egeus. What’s the news with thee?</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'>EGEUS.</a>
<a id='line_109'>Full of vexation come I, with complaint</a>
<a id='line_110'>Against my child, my daughter Hermia.</a>
<a id='line_111'>Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,</a>
<a id='line_112'>This man hath my consent to marry her.</a>
<a id='line_113'>Stand forth, Lysander. And, my gracious Duke,</a>
<a id='line_114'>This man hath bewitch’d the bosom of my child.</a>
<a id='line_115'>Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,</a>
<a id='line_116'>And interchang’d love-tokens with my child.</a>
<a id='line_117'>Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,</a>
<a id='line_118'>With feigning voice, verses of feigning love;</a>
<a id='line_119'>And stol’n the impression of her fantasy</a>
<a id='line_120'>With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gauds, conceits,</a>
<a id='line_121'>Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats (messengers</a>
<a id='line_122'>Of strong prevailment in unharden’d youth)</a>
<a id='line_123'>With cunning hast thou filch’d my daughter’s heart,</a>
<a id='line_124'>Turn’d her obedience (which is due to me)</a>
<a id='line_125'>To stubborn harshness. And, my gracious Duke,</a>
<a id='line_126'>Be it so she will not here before your grace</a>
<a id='line_127'>Consent to marry with Demetrius,</a>
<a id='line_128'>I beg the ancient privilege of Athens:</a>
<a id='line_129'>As she is mine I may dispose of her;</a>
<a id='line_130'>Which shall be either to this gentleman</a>
<a id='line_131'>Or to her death, according to our law</a>
<a id='line_132'>Immediately provided in that case.</a>
<a id='line_133'></a>
<a id='line_134'>THESEUS.</a>
<a id='line_135'>What say you, Hermia? Be advis’d, fair maid.</a>
<a id='line_136'>To you your father should be as a god;</a>
<a id='line_137'>One that compos’d your beauties, yea, and one</a>
<a id='line_138'>To whom you are but as a form in wax</a>
<a id='line_139'>By him imprinted, and within his power</a>
<a id='line_140'>To leave the figure, or disfigure it.</a>
<a id='line_141'>Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.</a>
<a id='line_142'></a>
<a id='line_143'>HERMIA.</a>
<a id='line_144'>So is Lysander.</a>
<a id='line_145'></a>
<a id='line_146'>THESEUS.</a>
<a id='line_147'>In himself he is.</a>
<a id='line_148'>But in this kind, wanting your father’s voice,</a>
<a id='line_149'>The other must be held the worthier.</a>
<a id='line_150'></a>
<a id='line_151'>HERMIA.</a>
<a id='line_152'>I would my father look’d but with my eyes.</a>
<a id='line_153'></a>
<a id='line_154'>THESEUS.</a>
<a id='line_155'>Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.</a>
<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>HERMIA.</a>
<a id='line_158'>I do entreat your Grace to pardon me.</a>
<a id='line_159'>I know not by what power I am made bold,</a>
<a id='line_160'>Nor how it may concern my modesty</a>
<a id='line_161'>In such a presence here to plead my thoughts:</a>
<a id='line_162'>But I beseech your Grace that I may know</a>
<a id='line_163'>The worst that may befall me in this case,</a>
<a id='line_164'>If I refuse to wed Demetrius.</a>
<a id='line_165'></a>
<a id='line_166'>THESEUS.</a>
<a id='line_167'>Either to die the death, or to abjure</a>
<a id='line_168'>For ever the society of men.</a>
<a id='line_169'>Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires,</a>
<a id='line_170'>Know of your youth, examine well your blood,</a>
<a id='line_171'>Whether, if you yield not to your father’s choice,</a>
<a id='line_172'>You can endure the livery of a nun,</a>
<a id='line_173'>For aye to be in shady cloister mew’d,</a>
<a id='line_174'>To live a barren sister all your life,</a>
<a id='line_175'>Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.</a>
<a id='line_176'>Thrice-blessèd they that master so their blood</a>
<a id='line_177'>To undergo such maiden pilgrimage,</a>
<a id='line_178'>But earthlier happy is the rose distill’d</a>
<a id='line_179'>Than that which, withering on the virgin thorn,</a>
<a id='line_180'>Grows, lives, and dies, in single blessedness.</a>
<a id='line_181'></a>
<a id='line_182'>HERMIA.</a>
<a id='line_183'>So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_184'>Ere I will yield my virgin patent up</a>
<a id='line_185'>Unto his lordship, whose unwishèd yoke</a>
<a id='line_186'>My soul consents not to give sovereignty.</a>
<a id='line_187'></a>
<a id='line_188'>THESEUS.</a>
<a id='line_189'>Take time to pause; and by the next new moon</a>
<a id='line_190'>The sealing-day betwixt my love and me</a>
<a id='line_191'>For everlasting bond of fellowship,</a>
<a id='line_192'>Upon that day either prepare to die</a>
<a id='line_193'>For disobedience to your father’s will,</a>
<a id='line_194'>Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would,</a>
<a id='line_195'>Or on Diana’s altar to protest</a>
<a id='line_196'>For aye austerity and single life.</a>
<a id='line_197'></a>
<a id='line_198'>DEMETRIUS.</a>
<a id='line_199'>Relent, sweet Hermia; and, Lysander, yield</a>
<a id='line_200'>Thy crazèd title to my certain right.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>LYSANDER.</a>
<a id='line_203'>You have her father’s love, Demetrius.</a>
<a id='line_204'>Let me have Hermia’s. Do you marry him.</a>
<a id='line_205'></a>
<a id='line_206'>EGEUS.</a>
<a id='line_207'>Scornful Lysander, true, he hath my love;</a>
<a id='line_208'>And what is mine my love shall render him;</a>
<a id='line_209'>And she is mine, and all my right of her</a>
<a id='line_210'>I do estate unto Demetrius.</a>
<a id='line_211'></a>
<a id='line_212'>LYSANDER.</a>
<a id='line_213'>I am, my lord, as well deriv’d as he,</a>
<a id='line_214'>As well possess’d; my love is more than his;</a>
<a id='line_215'>My fortunes every way as fairly rank’d,</a>
<a id='line_216'>If not with vantage, as Demetrius’;</a>
<a id='line_217'>And, which is more than all these boasts can be,</a>
<a id='line_218'>I am belov’d of beauteous Hermia.</a>
<a id='line_219'>Why should not I then prosecute my right?</a>
<a id='line_220'>Demetrius, I’ll avouch it to his head,</a>
<a id='line_221'>Made love to Nedar’s daughter, Helena,</a>
<a id='line_222'>And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,</a>
<a id='line_223'>Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,</a>
<a id='line_224'>Upon this spotted and inconstant man.</a>
<a id='line_225'></a>
<a id='line_226'>THESEUS.</a>
<a id='line_227'>I must confess that I have heard so much,</a>
<a id='line_228'>And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;</a>
<a id='line_229'>But, being over-full of self-affairs,</a>
<a id='line_230'>My mind did lose it.—But, Demetrius, come,</a>
<a id='line_231'>And come, Egeus; you shall go with me.</a>
<a id='line_232'>I have some private schooling for you both.—</a>
<a id='line_233'>For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself</a>
<a id='line_234'>To fit your fancies to your father’s will,</a>
<a id='line_235'>Or else the law of Athens yields you up</a>
<a id='line_236'>(Which by no means we may extenuate)</a>
<a id='line_237'>To death, or to a vow of single life.</a>
<a id='line_238'>Come, my Hippolyta. What cheer, my love?</a>
<a id='line_239'>Demetrius and Egeus, go along;</a>
<a id='line_240'>I must employ you in some business</a>
<a id='line_241'>Against our nuptial, and confer with you</a>
<a id='line_242'>Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.</a>
<a id='line_243'></a>
<a id='line_244'>EGEUS.</a>
<a id='line_245'>With duty and desire we follow you.</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'> [_Exeunt all but Lysander and Hermia._]</a>
<a id='line_248'></a>
<a id='line_249'>LYSANDER.</a>
<a id='line_250'>How now, my love? Why is your cheek so pale?</a>
<a id='line_251'>How chance the roses there do fade so fast?</a>
<a id='line_252'></a>
<a id='line_253'>HERMIA.</a>
<a id='line_254'>Belike for want of rain, which I could well</a>
<a id='line_255'>Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.</a>
<a id='line_256'></a>
<a id='line_257'>LYSANDER.</a>
<a id='line_258'>Ay me! For aught that I could ever read,</a>
<a id='line_259'>Could ever hear by tale or history,</a>
<a id='line_260'>The course of true love never did run smooth.</a>
<a id='line_261'>But either it was different in blood—</a>
<a id='line_262'></a>
<a id='line_263'>HERMIA.</a>
<a id='line_264'>O cross! Too high to be enthrall’d to low.</a>
<a id='line_265'></a>
<a id='line_266'>LYSANDER.</a>
<a id='line_267'>Or else misgraffèd in respect of years—</a>
<a id='line_268'></a>
<a id='line_269'>HERMIA.</a>
<a id='line_270'>O spite! Too old to be engag’d to young.</a>
<a id='line_271'></a>
<a id='line_272'>LYSANDER.</a>
<a id='line_273'>Or else it stood upon the choice of friends—</a>
<a id='line_274'></a>
<a id='line_275'>HERMIA.</a>
<a id='line_276'>O hell! to choose love by another’s eyes!</a>
<a id='line_277'></a>
<a id='line_278'>LYSANDER.</a>
<a id='line_279'>Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,</a>
<a id='line_280'>War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,</a>
<a id='line_281'>Making it momentany as a sound,</a>
<a id='line_282'>Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,</a>
<a id='line_283'>Brief as the lightning in the collied night</a>
<a id='line_284'>That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,</a>
<a id='line_285'>And, ere a man hath power to say, ‘Behold!’</a>
<a id='line_286'>The jaws of darkness do devour it up:</a>
<a id='line_287'>So quick bright things come to confusion.</a>
<a id='line_288'></a>
<a id='line_289'>HERMIA.</a>
<a id='line_290'>If then true lovers have ever cross’d,</a>
<a id='line_291'>It stands as an edict in destiny.</a>
<a id='line_292'>Then let us teach our trial patience,</a>
<a id='line_293'>Because it is a customary cross,</a>
<a id='line_294'>As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,</a>
<a id='line_295'>Wishes and tears, poor fancy’s followers.</a>
<a id='line_296'></a>
<a id='line_297'>LYSANDER.</a>
<a id='line_298'>A good persuasion; therefore, hear me, Hermia.</a>
<a id='line_299'>I have a widow aunt, a dowager</a>
<a id='line_300'>Of great revenue, and she hath no child.</a>
<a id='line_301'>From Athens is her house remote seven leagues,</a>
<a id='line_302'>And she respects me as her only son.</a>
<a id='line_303'>There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee,</a>
<a id='line_304'>And to that place the sharp Athenian law</a>
<a id='line_305'>Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,</a>
<a id='line_306'>Steal forth thy father’s house tomorrow night;</a>
<a id='line_307'>And in the wood, a league without the town</a>
<a id='line_308'>(Where I did meet thee once with Helena</a>
<a id='line_309'>To do observance to a morn of May),</a>
<a id='line_310'>There will I stay for thee.</a>
<a id='line_311'></a>
<a id='line_312'>HERMIA.</a>
<a id='line_313'>My good Lysander!</a>
<a id='line_314'>I swear to thee by Cupid’s strongest bow,</a>
<a id='line_315'>By his best arrow with the golden head,</a>
<a id='line_316'>By the simplicity of Venus’ doves,</a>
<a id='line_317'>By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,</a>
<a id='line_318'>And by that fire which burn’d the Carthage queen</a>
<a id='line_319'>When the false Trojan under sail was seen,</a>
<a id='line_320'>By all the vows that ever men have broke</a>
<a id='line_321'>(In number more than ever women spoke),</a>
<a id='line_322'>In that same place thou hast appointed me,</a>
<a id='line_323'>Tomorrow truly will I meet with thee.</a>
<a id='line_324'></a>
<a id='line_325'>LYSANDER.</a>
<a id='line_326'>Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.</a>
<a id='line_327'></a>
<a id='line_328'> Enter Helena.</a>
<a id='line_329'></a>
<a id='line_330'>HERMIA.</a>
<a id='line_331'>God speed fair Helena! Whither away?</a>
<a id='line_332'></a>
<a id='line_333'>HELENA.</a>
<a id='line_334'>Call you me fair? That fair again unsay.</a>
<a id='line_335'>Demetrius loves your fair. O happy fair!</a>
<a id='line_336'>Your eyes are lode-stars and your tongue’s sweet air</a>
<a id='line_337'>More tuneable than lark to shepherd’s ear,</a>
<a id='line_338'>When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.</a>
<a id='line_339'>Sickness is catching. O were favour so,</a>
<a id='line_340'>Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go.</a>
<a id='line_341'>My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,</a>
<a id='line_342'>My tongue should catch your tongue’s sweet melody.</a>
<a id='line_343'>Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,</a>
<a id='line_344'>The rest I’d give to be to you translated.</a>
<a id='line_345'>O, teach me how you look, and with what art</a>
<a id='line_346'>You sway the motion of Demetrius’ heart!</a>
<a id='line_347'></a>
<a id='line_348'>HERMIA.</a>
<a id='line_349'>I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.</a>
<a id='line_350'></a>
<a id='line_351'>HELENA.</a>
<a id='line_352'>O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!</a>
<a id='line_353'></a>
<a id='line_354'>HERMIA.</a>
<a id='line_355'>I give him curses, yet he gives me love.</a>
<a id='line_356'></a>
<a id='line_357'>HELENA.</a>
<a id='line_358'>O that my prayers could such affection move!</a>
<a id='line_359'></a>
<a id='line_360'>HERMIA.</a>
<a id='line_361'>The more I hate, the more he follows me.</a>
<a id='line_362'></a>
<a id='line_363'>HELENA.</a>
<a id='line_364'>The more I love, the more he hateth me.</a>
<a id='line_365'></a>
<a id='line_366'>HERMIA.</a>
<a id='line_367'>His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.</a>
<a id='line_368'></a>
<a id='line_369'>HELENA.</a>
<a id='line_370'>None but your beauty; would that fault were mine!</a>
<a id='line_371'></a>
<a id='line_372'>HERMIA.</a>
<a id='line_373'>Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;</a>
<a id='line_374'>Lysander and myself will fly this place.</a>
<a id='line_375'>Before the time I did Lysander see,</a>
<a id='line_376'>Seem’d Athens as a paradise to me.</a>

<a id='line_382'>Tomorrow night, when Phoebe doth behold</a>
<a id='line_383'>Her silver visage in the watery glass,</a>
<a id='line_384'>Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass</a>
<a id='line_385'>(A time that lovers’ flights doth still conceal),</a>
<a id='line_386'>Through Athens’ gates have we devis’d to steal.</a>
<a id='line_387'></a>
<a id='line_388'>HERMIA.</a>
<a id='line_389'>And in the wood where often you and I</a>
<a id='line_390'>Upon faint primrose beds were wont to lie,</a>
<a id='line_391'>Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,</a>
<a id='line_392'>There my Lysander and myself shall meet,</a>
<a id='line_393'>And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,</a>
<a id='line_394'>To seek new friends and stranger companies.</a>
<a id='line_395'>Farewell, sweet playfellow. Pray thou for us,</a>
<a id='line_396'>And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!</a>

<a id='line_411'>How happy some o’er other some can be!</a>
<a id='line_412'>Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.</a>
<a id='line_413'>But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;</a>
<a id='line_414'>He will not know what all but he do know.</a>
<a id='line_415'>And as he errs, doting on Hermia’s eyes,</a>
<a id='line_416'>So I, admiring of his qualities.</a>
<a id='line_417'>Things base and vile, holding no quantity,</a>
<a id='line_418'>Love can transpose to form and dignity.</a>
<a id='line_419'>Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;</a>
<a id='line_420'>And therefore is wing’d Cupid painted blind.</a>
<a id='line_421'>Nor hath love’s mind of any judgment taste.</a>
<a id='line_422'>Wings, and no eyes, figure unheedy haste.</a>
<a id='line_423'>And therefore is love said to be a child,</a>
<a id='line_424'>Because in choice he is so oft beguil’d.</a>
<a id='line_425'>As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,</a>
<a id='line_426'>So the boy Love is perjur’d everywhere.</a>
<a id='line_427'>For, ere Demetrius look’d on Hermia’s eyne,</a>
<a id='line_428'>He hail’d down oaths that he was only mine;</a>
<a id='line_429'>And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,</a>
<a id='line_430'>So he dissolv’d, and showers of oaths did melt.</a>
<a id='line_431'>I will go tell him of fair Hermia’s flight.</a>
<a id='line_432'>Then to the wood will he tomorrow night</a>
<a id='line_433'>Pursue her; and for this intelligence</a>
<a id='line_434'>If I have thanks, it is a dear expense.</a>
<a id='line_435'>But herein mean I to enrich my pain,</a>

<a id='line_466'>A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a merry. Now, good Peter</a>
<a id='line_467'>Quince, call forth your actors by the scroll. Masters, spread</a>
<a id='line_468'>yourselves.</a>

<a id='line_470'>QUINCE.</a>
<a id='line_471'>Answer, as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.</a>

<a id='line_481'></a>
<a id='line_482'>QUINCE.</a>
<a id='line_483'>A lover, that kills himself most gallantly for love.</a>
<a id='line_484'></a>
<a id='line_485'>BOTTOM.</a>
<a id='line_486'>That will ask some tears in the true performing of it. If I do it, let</a>
<a id='line_487'>the audience look to their eyes. I will move storms; I will condole in</a>
<a id='line_488'>some measure. To the rest—yet my chief humour is for a tyrant. I could</a>
<a id='line_489'>play Ercles rarely, or a part to tear a cat in, to make all split.</a>

<a id='line_499'></a>
<a id='line_500'>This was lofty. Now name the rest of the players. This is Ercles’ vein,</a>

<a id='line_522'>That’s all one. You shall play it in a mask, and you may speak as small</a>

<a id='line_552'>fitted.</a>
<a id='line_553'></a>
<a id='line_554'>SNUG</a>
<a id='line_555'>Have you the lion’s part written? Pray you, if it be, give it me, for I</a>
<a id='line_556'>am slow of study.</a>
<a id='line_557'></a>
<a id='line_558'>QUINCE.</a>
<a id='line_559'>You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.</a>
<a id='line_560'></a>
<a id='line_561'>BOTTOM.</a>
<a id='line_562'>Let me play the lion too. I will roar that I will do any man’s heart</a>

<a id='line_576'>aggravate my voice so, that I will roar you as gently as any sucking</a>
<a id='line_577'>dove; I will roar you an ’twere any nightingale.</a>
<a id='line_578'></a>
<a id='line_579'>QUINCE.</a>
<a id='line_580'>You can play no part but Pyramus, for Pyramus is a sweet-faced man; a</a>
<a id='line_581'>proper man as one shall see in a summer’s day; a most lovely</a>
<a id='line_582'>gentleman-like man. Therefore you must needs play Pyramus.</a>

<a id='line_591'>I will discharge it in either your straw-colour beard, your</a>

<a id='line_594'></a>
<a id='line_595'>QUINCE.</a>
<a id='line_596'>Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and then you will play</a>

<a id='line_598'>request you, and desire you, to con them by tomorrow night; and meet me</a>
<a id='line_599'>in the palace wood, a mile without the town, by moonlight; there will</a>
<a id='line_600'>we rehearse, for if we meet in the city, we shall be dogg’d with</a>

<a id='line_1887'>Injurious Hermia, most ungrateful maid!</a>
<a id='line_1888'>Have you conspir’d, have you with these contriv’d,</a>
<a id='line_1889'>To bait me with this foul derision?</a>
<a id='line_1890'>Is all the counsel that we two have shar’d,</a>
<a id='line_1891'>The sisters’ vows, the hours that we have spent,</a>
<a id='line_1892'>When we have chid the hasty-footed time</a>
<a id='line_1893'>For parting us—O, is all forgot?</a>
<a id='line_1894'>All school-days’ friendship, childhood innocence?</a>
<a id='line_1895'>We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,</a>
<a id='line_1896'>Have with our needles created both one flower,</a>
<a id='line_1897'>Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,</a>
<a id='line_1898'>Both warbling of one song, both in one key,</a>
<a id='line_1899'>As if our hands, our sides, voices, and minds,</a>
<a id='line_1900'>Had been incorporate. So we grew together,</a>
<a id='line_1901'>Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,</a>
<a id='line_1902'>But yet a union in partition,</a>
<a id='line_1903'>Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;</a>
<a id='line_1904'>So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;</a>
<a id='line_1905'>Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,</a>
<a id='line_1906'>Due but to one, and crownèd with one crest.</a>
<a id='line_1907'>And will you rent our ancient love asunder,</a>
<a id='line_1908'>To join with men in scorning your poor friend?</a>
<a id='line_1909'>It is not friendly, ’tis not maidenly.</a>
<a id='line_1910'>Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,</a>

<a id='line_1918'>Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,</a>
<a id='line_1919'>To follow me, and praise my eyes and face?</a>
<a id='line_1920'>And made your other love, Demetrius,</a>
<a id='line_1921'>Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,</a>
<a id='line_1922'>To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,</a>
<a id='line_1923'>Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this</a>
<a id='line_1924'>To her he hates? And wherefore doth Lysander</a>
<a id='line_1925'>Deny your love, so rich within his soul,</a>
<a id='line_1926'>And tender me, forsooth, affection,</a>
<a id='line_1927'>But by your setting on, by your consent?</a>
<a id='line_1928'>What though I be not so in grace as you,</a>
<a id='line_1929'>So hung upon with love, so fortunate,</a>
<a id='line_1930'>But miserable most, to love unlov’d?</a>

<a id='line_2045'>Now I perceive that she hath made compare</a>

<a id='line_2625'>As the remembrance of an idle gaud</a>
