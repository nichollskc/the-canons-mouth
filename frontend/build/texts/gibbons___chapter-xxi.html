<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>      The grateful applause of the clergy has consecrated the memory of</a>
<a id='line_8'>      a prince who indulged their passions and promoted their interest.</a>
<a id='line_9'>      Constantine gave them security, wealth, honors, and revenge; and</a>
<a id='line_10'>      the support of the orthodox faith was considered as the most</a>
<a id='line_11'>      sacred and important duty of the civil magistrate. The edict of</a>
<a id='line_12'>      Milan, the great charter of toleration, had confirmed to each</a>
<a id='line_13'>      individual of the Roman world the privilege of choosing and</a>
<a id='line_14'>      professing his own religion. But this inestimable privilege was</a>
<a id='line_15'>      soon violated; with the knowledge of truth, the emperor imbibed</a>
<a id='line_16'>      the maxims of persecution; and the sects which dissented from the</a>
<a id='line_17'>      Catholic church were afflicted and oppressed by the triumph of</a>
<a id='line_18'>      Christianity. Constantine easily believed that the Heretics, who</a>
<a id='line_19'>      presumed to dispute _his_ opinions, or to oppose _his_ commands,</a>
<a id='line_20'>      were guilty of the most absurd and criminal obstinacy; and that a</a>
<a id='line_21'>      seasonable application of moderate severities might save those</a>
<a id='line_22'>      unhappy men from the danger of an everlasting condemnation. Not a</a>
<a id='line_23'>      moment was lost in excluding the ministers and teachers of the</a>
<a id='line_24'>      separated congregations from any share of the rewards and</a>
<a id='line_25'>      immunities which the emperor had so liberally bestowed on the</a>
<a id='line_26'>      orthodox clergy. But as the sectaries might still exist under the</a>
<a id='line_27'>      cloud of royal disgrace, the conquest of the East was immediately</a>
<a id='line_28'>      followed by an edict which announced their total destruction. 1</a>
<a id='line_29'>      After a preamble filled with passion and reproach, Constantine</a>
<a id='line_30'>      absolutely prohibits the assemblies of the Heretics, and</a>
<a id='line_31'>      confiscates their public property to the use either of the</a>
<a id='line_32'>      revenue or of the Catholic church. The sects against whom the</a>
<a id='line_33'>      Imperial severity was directed, appear to have been the adherents</a>
<a id='line_34'>      of Paul of Samosata; the Montanists of Phrygia, who maintained an</a>
<a id='line_35'>      enthusiastic succession of prophecy; the Novatians, who sternly</a>
<a id='line_36'>      rejected the temporal efficacy of repentance; the Marcionites and</a>
<a id='line_37'>      Valentinians, under whose leading banners the various Gnostics of</a>
<a id='line_38'>      Asia and Egypt had insensibly rallied; and perhaps the</a>
<a id='line_39'>      Manich¾ans, who had recently imported from Persia a more artful</a>
<a id='line_40'>      composition of Oriental and Christian theology. 2 The design of</a>
<a id='line_41'>      extirpating the name, or at least of restraining the progress, of</a>
<a id='line_42'>      these odious Heretics, was prosecuted with vigor and effect. Some</a>
<a id='line_43'>      of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of</a>
<a id='line_44'>      Diocletian; and this method of conversion was applauded by the</a>
<a id='line_45'>      same bishops who had felt the hand of oppression, and pleaded for</a>
<a id='line_46'>      the rights of humanity. Two immaterial circumstances may serve,</a>
<a id='line_47'>      however, to prove that the mind of Constantine was not entirely</a>
<a id='line_48'>      corrupted by the spirit of zeal and bigotry. Before he condemned</a>
<a id='line_49'>      the Manich¾ans and their kindred sects, he resolved to make an</a>
<a id='line_50'>      accurate inquiry into the nature of their religious principles.</a>
<a id='line_51'>      As if he distrusted the impartiality of his ecclesiastical</a>
<a id='line_52'>      counsellors, this delicate commission was intrusted to a civil</a>
<a id='line_53'>      magistrate, whose learning and moderation he justly esteemed, and</a>
<a id='line_54'>      of whose venal character he was probably ignorant. 3 The emperor</a>
<a id='line_55'>      was soon convinced, that he had too hastily proscribed the</a>
<a id='line_56'>      orthodox faith and the exemplary morals of the Novatians, who had</a>
<a id='line_57'>      dissented from the church in some articles of discipline which</a>
<a id='line_58'>      were not perhaps essential to salvation. By a particular edict,</a>
<a id='line_59'>      he exempted them from the general penalties of the law; 4 allowed</a>
<a id='line_60'>      them to build a church at Constantinople, respected the miracles</a>
<a id='line_61'>      of their saints, invited their bishop Acesius to the council of</a>
<a id='line_62'>      Nice; and gently ridiculed the narrow tenets of his sect by a</a>
<a id='line_63'>      familiar jest; which, from the mouth of a sovereign, must have</a>
<a id='line_64'>      been received with applause and gratitude. 5</a>

<a id='line_97'>      of Constantine, as soon as the death of Maxentius had submitted</a>
<a id='line_98'>      Africa to his victorious arms, were ill adapted to edify an</a>
<a id='line_99'>      imperfect proselyte. He learned, with surprise, that the</a>
<a id='line_100'>      provinces of that great country, from the confines of Cyrene to</a>
<a id='line_101'>      the columns of Hercules, were distracted with religious discord.</a>
<a id='line_102'>      6 The source of the division was derived from a double election</a>
<a id='line_103'>      in the church of Carthage; the second, in rank and opulence, of</a>
<a id='line_104'>      the ecclesiastical thrones of the West. C¾cilian and Majorinus</a>
<a id='line_105'>      were the two rival prelates of Africa; and the death of the</a>
<a id='line_106'>      latter soon made room for Donatus, who, by his superior abilities</a>
<a id='line_107'>      and apparent virtues, was the firmest support of his party. The</a>
<a id='line_108'>      advantage which C¾cilian might claim from the priority of his</a>
<a id='line_109'>      ordination, was destroyed by the illegal, or at least indecent,</a>
<a id='line_110'>      haste, with which it had been performed, without expecting the</a>
<a id='line_111'>      arrival of the bishops of Numidia. The authority of these</a>
<a id='line_112'>      bishops, who, to the number of seventy, condemned C¾cilian, and</a>
<a id='line_113'>      consecrated Majorinus, is again weakened by the infamy of some of</a>
<a id='line_114'>      their personal characters; and by the female intrigues,</a>
<a id='line_115'>      sacrilegious bargains, and tumultuous proceedings, which are</a>
<a id='line_116'>      imputed to this Numidian council. 7 The bishops of the contending</a>
<a id='line_117'>      factions maintained, with equal ardor and obstinacy, that their</a>
<a id='line_118'>      adversaries were degraded, or at least dishonored, by the odious</a>
<a id='line_119'>      crime of delivering the Holy Scriptures to the officers of</a>
<a id='line_120'>      Diocletian. From their mutual reproaches, as well as from the</a>
<a id='line_121'>      story of this dark transaction, it may justly be inferred, that</a>
<a id='line_122'>      the late persecution had imbittered the zeal, without reforming</a>
<a id='line_123'>      the manners, of the African Christians. That divided church was</a>
<a id='line_124'>      incapable of affording an impartial judicature; the controversy</a>
<a id='line_125'>      was solemnly tried in five successive tribunals, which were</a>
<a id='line_126'>      appointed by the emperor; and the whole proceeding, from the</a>
<a id='line_127'>      first appeal to the final sentence, lasted above three years. A</a>
<a id='line_128'>      severe inquisition, which was taken by the Pr¾torian vicar, and</a>
<a id='line_129'>      the proconsul of Africa, the report of two episcopal visitors who</a>
<a id='line_130'>      had been sent to Carthage, the decrees of the councils of Rome</a>
<a id='line_131'>      and of Arles, and the supreme judgment of Constantine himself in</a>
<a id='line_132'>      his sacred consistory, were all favorable to the cause of</a>
<a id='line_133'>      C¾cilian; and he was unanimously acknowledged by the civil and</a>
<a id='line_134'>      ecclesiastical powers, as the true and lawful primate of Africa.</a>
<a id='line_135'>      The honors and estates of the church were attributed to _his_</a>
<a id='line_136'>      suffragan bishops, and it was not without difficulty, that</a>
<a id='line_137'>      Constantine was satisfied with inflicting the punishment of exile</a>
<a id='line_138'>      on the principal leaders of the Donatist faction. As their cause</a>
<a id='line_139'>      was examined with attention, perhaps it was determined with</a>
<a id='line_140'>      justice. Perhaps their complaint was not without foundation, that</a>
<a id='line_141'>      the credulity of the emperor had been abused by the insidious</a>
<a id='line_142'>      arts of his favorite Osius. The influence of falsehood and</a>
<a id='line_143'>      corruption might procure the condemnation of the innocent, or</a>
<a id='line_144'>      aggravate the sentence of the guilty. Such an act, however, of</a>
<a id='line_145'>      injustice, if it concluded an importunate dispute, might be</a>
<a id='line_146'>      numbered among the transient evils of a despotic administration,</a>

<a id='line_170'>      But this incident, so inconsiderable that it scarcely deserves a</a>
<a id='line_171'>      place in history, was productive of a memorable schism which</a>
<a id='line_172'>      afflicted the provinces of Africa above three hundred years, and</a>
<a id='line_173'>      was extinguished only with Christianity itself. The inflexible</a>
<a id='line_174'>      zeal of freedom and fanaticism animated the Donatists to refuse</a>
<a id='line_175'>      obedience to the usurpers, whose election they disputed, and</a>
<a id='line_176'>      whose spiritual powers they denied. Excluded from the civil and</a>
<a id='line_177'>      religious communion of mankind, they boldly excommunicated the</a>
<a id='line_178'>      rest of mankind, who had embraced the impious party of C¾cilian,</a>
<a id='line_179'>      and of the Traditors, from which he derived his pretended</a>
<a id='line_180'>      ordination. They asserted with confidence, and almost with</a>
<a id='line_181'>      exultation, that the Apostolical succession was interrupted; that</a>
<a id='line_182'>      _all_ the bishops of Europe and Asia were infected by the</a>
<a id='line_183'>      contagion of guilt and schism; and that the prerogatives of the</a>
<a id='line_184'>      Catholic church were confined to the chosen portion of the</a>
<a id='line_185'>      African believers, who alone had preserved inviolate the</a>
<a id='line_186'>      integrity of their faith and discipline. This rigid theory was</a>
<a id='line_187'>      supported by the most uncharitable conduct. Whenever they</a>
<a id='line_188'>      acquired a proselyte, even from the distant provinces of the</a>
<a id='line_189'>      East, they carefully repeated the sacred rites of baptism 8 and</a>
<a id='line_190'>      ordination; as they rejected the validity of those which he had</a>
<a id='line_191'>      already received from the hands of heretics or schismatics.</a>
<a id='line_192'>      Bishops, virgins, and even spotless infants, were subjected to</a>
<a id='line_193'>      the disgrace of a public penance, before they could be admitted</a>
<a id='line_194'>      to the communion of the Donatists. If they obtained possession of</a>
<a id='line_195'>      a church which had been used by their Catholic adversaries, they</a>
<a id='line_196'>      purified the unhallowed building with the same zealous care which</a>
<a id='line_197'>      a temple of idols might have required. They washed the pavement,</a>
<a id='line_198'>      scraped the walls, burnt the altar, which was commonly of wood,</a>
<a id='line_199'>      melted the consecrated plate, and cast the Holy Eucharist to the</a>
<a id='line_200'>      dogs, with every circumstance of ignominy which could provoke and</a>
<a id='line_201'>      perpetuate the animosity of religious factions. 9 Notwithstanding</a>
<a id='line_202'>      this irreconcilable aversion, the two parties, who were mixed and</a>
<a id='line_203'>      separated in all the cities of Africa, had the same language and</a>
<a id='line_204'>      manners, the same zeal and learning, the same faith and worship.</a>
<a id='line_205'>      Proscribed by the civil and ecclesiastical powers of the empire,</a>
<a id='line_206'>      the Donatists still maintained in some provinces, particularly in</a>
<a id='line_207'>      Numidia, their superior numbers; and four hundred bishops</a>
<a id='line_208'>      acknowledged the jurisdiction of their primate. But the</a>
<a id='line_209'>      invincible spirit of the sect sometimes preyed on its own vitals:</a>
<a id='line_210'>      and the bosom of their schismatical church was torn by intestine</a>
<a id='line_211'>      divisions. A fourth part of the Donatist bishops followed the</a>
<a id='line_212'>      independent standard of the Maximianists. The narrow and solitary</a>
<a id='line_213'>      path which their first leaders had marked out, continued to</a>
<a id='line_214'>      deviate from the great society of mankind. Even the imperceptible</a>
<a id='line_215'>      sect of the Rogatians could affirm, without a blush, that when</a>
<a id='line_216'>      Christ should descend to judge the earth, he would find his true</a>
<a id='line_217'>      religion preserved only in a few nameless villages of the</a>

<a id='line_236'>      The schism of the Donatists was confined to Africa: the more</a>
<a id='line_237'>      diffusive mischief of the Trinitarian controversy successively</a>
<a id='line_238'>      penetrated into every part of the Christian world. The former was</a>
<a id='line_239'>      an accidental quarrel, occasioned by the abuse of freedom; the</a>
<a id='line_240'>      latter was a high and mysterious argument, derived from the abuse</a>
<a id='line_241'>      of philosophy. From the age of Constantine to that of Clovis and</a>
<a id='line_242'>      Theodoric, the temporal interests both of the Romans and</a>
<a id='line_243'>      Barbarians were deeply involved in the theological disputes of</a>
<a id='line_244'>      Arianism. The historian may therefore be permitted respectfully</a>
<a id='line_245'>      to withdraw the veil of the sanctuary; and to deduce the progress</a>
<a id='line_246'>      of reason and faith, of error and passion from the school of</a>
<a id='line_247'>      Plato, to the decline and fall of the empire.</a>
<a id='line_248'></a>
<a id='line_249'>      The genius of Plato, informed by his own meditation, or by the</a>
<a id='line_250'>      traditional knowledge of the priests of Egypt, 11 had ventured to</a>
<a id='line_251'>      explore the mysterious nature of the Deity. When he had elevated</a>
<a id='line_252'>      his mind to the sublime contemplation of the first self-existent,</a>

<a id='line_298'>          According to Plato, God and matter existed from all eternity.</a>
<a id='line_299'>          Before the creation of the world, matter had in itself a</a>
<a id='line_300'>          principle of motion, but without end or laws: it is this</a>
<a id='line_301'>          principle which Plato calls the irrational soul of the world,</a>
<a id='line_302'>          because, according to his doctrine, every spontaneous and</a>
<a id='line_303'>          original principle of motion is called soul. God wished to</a>
<a id='line_304'>          impress _form_ upon matter, that is to say, 1. To mould</a>
<a id='line_305'>          matter, and make it into a body; 2. To regulate its motion,</a>
<a id='line_306'>          and subject it to some end and to certain laws. The Deity, in</a>
<a id='line_307'>          this operation, could not act but according to the ideas</a>
<a id='line_308'>          existing in his intelligence: their union filled this, and</a>
<a id='line_309'>          formed the ideal type of the world. It is this ideal world,</a>
<a id='line_310'>          this divine intelligence, existing with God from all</a>
<a id='line_311'>          eternity, and called by Plato which he is supposed to</a>
<a id='line_312'>          personify, to substantialize; while an attentive examination</a>
<a id='line_313'>          is sufficient to convince us that he has never assigned it an</a>
<a id='line_314'>          existence external to the Deity, (hors de la DivinitŽ,) and</a>
<a id='line_315'>          that he considered the as the aggregate of the ideas of God,</a>
<a id='line_316'>          the divine understanding in its relation to the world. The</a>
<a id='line_317'>          contrary opinion is irreconcilable with all his philosophy:</a>
<a id='line_318'>          thus he says (Tim¾us, p. 348, edit. Bip.) that to the idea of</a>
<a id='line_319'>          the Deity is essentially united that of intelligence, of a</a>
<a id='line_320'>          _logos_. He would thus have admitted a double _logos;_ one</a>
<a id='line_321'>          inherent in the Deity as an attribute, the other</a>
<a id='line_322'>          independently existing as a substance. He affirms that the</a>
<a id='line_323'>          intelligence, the principle of order cannot exist but as an</a>
<a id='line_324'>          attribute of a soul, the principle of motion and of life, of</a>
<a id='line_325'>          which the nature is unknown to us. How, then, according to</a>
<a id='line_326'>          this, could he consider the _logos_ as a substance endowed</a>
<a id='line_327'>          with an independent existence? In other places, he explains</a>
<a id='line_328'>          it by these two words, knowledge, science, and intelligence</a>
<a id='line_329'>          which signify the attributes of the Deity. When Plato</a>
<a id='line_330'>          separates God, the ideal archetype of the world and matter,</a>
<a id='line_331'>          it is to explain how, according to his system, God has</a>
<a id='line_332'>          proceeded, at the creation, to unite the principle of order</a>
<a id='line_333'>          which he had within himself, his proper intelligence, the</a>
<a id='line_334'>          principle of motion, to the principle of motion, the</a>
<a id='line_335'>          irrational soul which was in matter. When he speaks of the</a>
<a id='line_336'>          place occupied by the ideal world, it is to designate the</a>
<a id='line_337'>          divine intelligence, which is its cause. Finally, in no part</a>
<a id='line_338'>          of his writings do we find a true personification of the</a>
<a id='line_339'>          pretended beings of which he is said to have formed a</a>
<a id='line_340'>          trinity: and if this personification existed, it would</a>
<a id='line_341'>          equally apply to many other notions, of which might be formed</a>
<a id='line_342'>          many different trinities.</a>
<a id='line_343'>          This error, into which many ancient as well as modern</a>

<a id='line_346'>          besides the necessity of comprehending as a whole the system</a>
<a id='line_347'>          of his ideas, and not to explain isolated passages, the</a>
<a id='line_348'>          nature of his doctrine itself would conduce to this error.</a>
<a id='line_349'>          When Plato appeared, the uncertainty of human knowledge, and</a>
<a id='line_350'>          the continual illusions of the senses, were acknowledged, and</a>
<a id='line_351'>          had given rise to a general scepticism. Socrates had aimed at</a>
<a id='line_352'>          raising morality above the influence of this scepticism:</a>
<a id='line_353'>          Plato endeavored to save metaphysics, by seeking in the human</a>
<a id='line_354'>          intellect a source of certainty which the senses could not</a>
<a id='line_355'>          furnish. He invented the system of innate ideas, of which the</a>
<a id='line_356'>          aggregate formed, according to him, the ideal world, and</a>
<a id='line_357'>          affirmed that these ideas were real attributes, not only</a>
<a id='line_358'>          attached to our conceptions of objects, but to the nature of</a>
<a id='line_359'>          the objects themselves; a nature of which from them we might</a>
<a id='line_360'>          obtain a knowledge. He gave, then, to these ideas a positive</a>
<a id='line_361'>          existence as attributes; his commentators could easily give</a>
<a id='line_362'>          them a real existence as substances; especially as the terms</a>

<a id='line_413'>      assembled, was the scene of a strange fusion of the system of</a>
<a id='line_414'>      these three people. The Greeks brought a Platonism, already much</a>

<a id='line_416'>      Oriental notions, and whose theological opinions had undergone</a>
<a id='line_417'>      great changes by this intercourse, endeavored to reconcile</a>

<a id='line_419'>      lastly, the Egyptians, who were not willing to abandon notions</a>

<a id='line_421'>      on their side to reconcile their own with those of their</a>
<a id='line_422'>      neighbors. It is in Ecclesiasticus and the Wisdom of Solomon that</a>
<a id='line_423'>      we trace the influence of Oriental philosophy rather than that of</a>
<a id='line_424'>      Platonism. We find in these books, and in those of the later</a>
<a id='line_425'>      prophets, as in Ezekiel, notions unknown to the Jews before the</a>
<a id='line_426'>      Babylonian captivity, of which we do not discover the germ in</a>
<a id='line_427'>      Plato, but which are manifestly derived from the Orientals. Thus</a>
<a id='line_428'>      God represented under the image of light, and the principle of</a>
<a id='line_429'>      evil under that of darkness; the history of the good and bad</a>

<a id='line_431'>      origin, or at least the positive determination, can only be</a>
<a id='line_432'>      referred to the Oriental philosophy. Plato supposed matter</a>
<a id='line_433'>      eternal; the Orientals and the Jews considered it as a creation</a>
<a id='line_434'>      of God, who alone was eternal. It is impossible to explain the</a>
<a id='line_435'>      philosophy of the Alexandrian school solely by the blending of</a>
<a id='line_436'>      the Jewish theology with the Greek philosophy. The Oriental</a>
<a id='line_437'>      philosophy, however little it may be known, is recognized at</a>
<a id='line_438'>      every instant. Thus, according to the Zend Avesta, it is by the</a>
<a id='line_439'>      Word (honover) more ancient than the world, that Ormuzd created</a>
<a id='line_440'>      the universe. This word is the logos of Philo, consequently very</a>
<a id='line_441'>      different from that of Plato. I have shown that Plato never</a>
<a id='line_442'>      personified the logos as the ideal archetype of the world: Philo</a>
<a id='line_443'>      ventured this personification. The Deity, according to him, has a</a>
<a id='line_444'>      double logos; the first is the ideal archetype of the world, the</a>
<a id='line_445'>      ideal world, the _first-born_ of the Deity; the second is the</a>
<a id='line_446'>      word itself of God, personified under the image of a being acting</a>
<a id='line_447'>      to create the sensible world, and to make it like to the ideal</a>
<a id='line_448'>      world: it is the second-born of God. Following out his</a>
<a id='line_449'>      imaginations, Philo went so far as to personify anew the ideal</a>
<a id='line_450'>      world, under the image of a celestial man, the primitive type of</a>
<a id='line_451'>      man, and the sensible world under the image of another man less</a>
<a id='line_452'>      perfect than the celestial man. Certain notions of the Oriental</a>

<a id='line_455'>      Platonism had already undergone, and what was their source.</a>
<a id='line_456'>      Philo, moreover, of all the Jews of Alexandria, is the one whose</a>

<a id='line_523'>      the Evangelists. 20 The Christian Revelation, which was</a>
<a id='line_524'>      consummated under the reign of Nerva, disclosed to the world the</a>
<a id='line_525'>      amazing secret, that the Logos, who was with God from the</a>
<a id='line_526'>      beginning, and was God, who had made all things, and for whom all</a>
<a id='line_527'>      things had been made, was incarnate in the person of Jesus of</a>
<a id='line_528'>      Nazareth; who had been born of a virgin, and suffered death on</a>
<a id='line_529'>      the cross. Besides the general design of fixing on a perpetual</a>
<a id='line_530'>      basis the divine honors of Christ, the most ancient and</a>
<a id='line_531'>      respectable of the ecclesiastical writers have ascribed to the</a>
<a id='line_532'>      evangelic theologian a particular intention to confute two</a>
<a id='line_533'>      opposite heresies, which disturbed the peace of the primitive</a>
<a id='line_534'>      church. 21 I. The faith of the Ebionites, 22 perhaps of the</a>
<a id='line_535'>      Nazarenes, 23 was gross and imperfect. They revered Jesus as the</a>
<a id='line_536'>      greatest of the prophets, endowed with supernatural virtue and</a>
<a id='line_537'>      power. They ascribed to his person and to his future reign all</a>
<a id='line_538'>      the predictions of the Hebrew oracles which relate to the</a>
<a id='line_539'>      spiritual and everlasting kingdom of the promised Messiah. 24</a>
<a id='line_540'>      Some of them might confess that he was born of a virgin; but they</a>
<a id='line_541'>      obstinately rejected the preceding existence and divine</a>
<a id='line_542'>      perfections of the _Logos_, or Son of God, which are so clearly</a>
<a id='line_543'>      defined in the Gospel of St. John. About fifty years afterwards,</a>
<a id='line_544'>      the Ebionites, whose errors are mentioned by Justin Martyr with</a>
<a id='line_545'>      less severity than they seem to deserve, 25 formed a very</a>
<a id='line_546'>      inconsiderable portion of the Christian name. II. The Gnostics,</a>
<a id='line_547'>      who were distinguished by the epithet of _Docetes_, deviated into</a>
<a id='line_548'>      the contrary extreme; and betrayed the human, while they asserted</a>
<a id='line_549'>      the divine, nature of Christ. Educated in the school of Plato,</a>
<a id='line_550'>      accustomed to the sublime idea of the Logos, they readily</a>
<a id='line_551'>      conceived that the brightest _®on_, or _Emanation_ of the Deity,</a>
<a id='line_552'>      might assume the outward shape and visible appearances of a</a>
<a id='line_553'>      mortal; 26 but they vainly pretended, that the imperfections of</a>
<a id='line_554'>      matter are incompatible with the purity of a celestial substance.</a>
<a id='line_555'></a>
<a id='line_556'>      While the blood of Christ yet smoked on Mount Calvary, the</a>
<a id='line_557'>      Docetes invented the impious and extravagant hypothesis, that,</a>
<a id='line_558'>      instead of issuing from the womb of the Virgin, 27 he had</a>
<a id='line_559'>      descended on the banks of the Jordan in the form of perfect</a>
<a id='line_560'>      manhood; that he had imposed on the senses of his enemies, and of</a>
<a id='line_561'>      his disciples; and that the ministers of Pilate had wasted their</a>
<a id='line_562'>      impotent rage on an ury phantom, who _seemed_ to expire on the</a>
<a id='line_563'>      cross, and, after three days, to rise from the dead. 28</a>

<a id='line_571'>      short discussion on the sense in which St. John has used the word</a>
<a id='line_572'>      Logos, will prove that he has not borrowed it from the philosophy</a>
<a id='line_573'>      of Plato. The evangelist adopts this word without previous</a>
<a id='line_574'>      explanation, as a term with which his contemporaries were already</a>
<a id='line_575'>      familiar, and which they could at once comprehend. To know the</a>
<a id='line_576'>      sense which he gave to it, we must inquire that which it</a>
<a id='line_577'>      generally bore in his time. We find two: the one attached to the</a>
<a id='line_578'>      word _logos_ by the Jews of Palestine, the other by the school of</a>
<a id='line_579'>      Alexandria, particularly by Philo. The Jews had feared at all</a>
<a id='line_580'>      times to pronounce the name of Jehovah; they had formed a habit</a>
<a id='line_581'>      of designating God by one of his attributes; they called him</a>
<a id='line_582'>      sometimes Wisdom, sometimes the Word. _By the word of the Lord</a>
<a id='line_583'>      were the heavens made_. (Psalm xxxiii. 6.) Accustomed to</a>
<a id='line_584'>      allegories, they often addressed themselves to this attribute of</a>
<a id='line_585'>      the Deity as a real being. Solomon makes Wisdom say ÒThe Lord</a>
<a id='line_586'>      possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of</a>
<a id='line_587'>      old. I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever</a>
<a id='line_588'>      the earth was.Ó (Prov. viii. 22, 23.) Their residence in Persia</a>
<a id='line_589'>      only increased this inclination to sustained allegories. In the</a>
<a id='line_590'>      Ecclesiasticus of the son of Sirach, and the Book of Wisdom, we</a>
<a id='line_591'>      find allegorical descriptions of Wisdom like the following: ÒI</a>
<a id='line_592'>      came out of the mouth of the Most High; I covered the earth as a</a>
<a id='line_593'>      cloud;... I alone compassed the circuit of heaven, and walked in</a>
<a id='line_594'>      the bottom of the deep... The Creator created me from the</a>
<a id='line_595'>      beginning, before the world, and I shall never fail.Ó (Eccles.</a>
<a id='line_596'>      xxiv. 35- 39.) See also the Wisdom of Solomon, c. vii. v. 9. [The</a>
<a id='line_597'>      latter book is clearly Alexandrian.ÑM.] We see from this that the</a>
<a id='line_598'>      Jews understood from the Hebrew and Chaldaic words which signify</a>
<a id='line_599'>      Wisdom, the Word, and which were translated into Greek, a simple</a>
<a id='line_600'>      attribute of the Deity, allegorically personified, but of which</a>
<a id='line_601'>      they did not make a real particular being separate from the</a>
<a id='line_602'>      Deity.</a>
<a id='line_603'>          The school of Alexandria, on the contrary, and Philo among</a>
<a id='line_604'>          the rest, mingling Greek with Jewish and Oriental notions,</a>
<a id='line_605'>          and abandoning himself to his inclination to mysticism,</a>
<a id='line_606'>          personified the logos, and represented it a distinct being,</a>
<a id='line_607'>          created by God, and intermediate between God and man. This is</a>
<a id='line_608'>          the second _logos_ of Philo, that which acts from the</a>
<a id='line_609'>          beginning of the world, alone in its kind, creator of the</a>
<a id='line_610'>          sensible world, formed by God according to the ideal world</a>
<a id='line_611'>          which he had in himself, and which was the first logos, the</a>
<a id='line_612'>          first- born of the Deity. The logos taken in this sense,</a>
<a id='line_613'>          then, was a created being, but, anterior to the creation of</a>
<a id='line_614'>          the world, near to God, and charged with his revelations to</a>
<a id='line_615'>          mankind.</a>
<a id='line_616'>          Which of these two senses is that which St. John intended to</a>
<a id='line_617'>          assign to the word logos in the first chapter of his Gospel,</a>
<a id='line_618'>          and in all his writings? St. John was a Jew, born and</a>
<a id='line_619'>          educated in Palestine; he had no knowledge, at least very</a>
<a id='line_620'>          little, of the philosophy of the Greeks, and that of the</a>
<a id='line_621'>          Grecizing Jews: he would naturally, then, attach to the word</a>
<a id='line_622'>          _logos_ the sense attached to it by the Jews of Palestine.</a>
<a id='line_623'>          If, in fact, we compare the attributes which he assigns to</a>
<a id='line_624'>          the _logos_ with those which are assigned to it in Proverbs,</a>
<a id='line_625'>          in the Wisdom of Solomon, in Ecclesiasticus, we shall see</a>
<a id='line_626'>          that they are the same. The Word was in the world, and the</a>
<a id='line_627'>          world was made by him; in him was life, and the life was the</a>
<a id='line_628'>          light of men, (c. i. v. 10-14.) It is impossible not to trace</a>
<a id='line_629'>          in this chapter the ideas which the Jews had formed of the</a>
<a id='line_630'>          allegorized logos. The evangelist afterwards really</a>
<a id='line_631'>          personifies that which his predecessors have personified only</a>
<a id='line_632'>          poetically; for he affirms Ò_that the Word became flesh_,Ó</a>
<a id='line_633'>          (v. 14.) It was to prove this that he wrote. Closely</a>
<a id='line_634'>          examined, the ideas which he gives of the logos cannot agree</a>
<a id='line_635'>          with those of Philo and the school of Alexandria; they</a>
<a id='line_636'>          correspond, on the contrary, with those of the Jews of</a>
<a id='line_637'>          Palestine. Perhaps St. John, employing a well-known term to</a>
<a id='line_638'>          explain a doctrine which was yet unknown, has slightly</a>
<a id='line_639'>          altered the sense; it is this alteration which we appear to</a>
<a id='line_640'>          discover on comparing different passages of his writings.</a>
<a id='line_641'>          It is worthy of remark, that the Jews of Palestine, who did</a>
<a id='line_642'>          not perceive this alteration, could find nothing</a>
<a id='line_643'>          extraordinary in what St. John said of the Logos; at least</a>
<a id='line_644'>          they comprehended it without difficulty, while the Greeks and</a>
<a id='line_645'>          Grecizing Jews, on their part, brought to it prejudices and</a>
<a id='line_646'>          preconceptions easily reconciled with those of the</a>
<a id='line_647'>          evangelist, who did not expressly contradict them. This</a>
<a id='line_648'>          circumstance must have much favored the progress of</a>
<a id='line_649'>          Christianity. Thus the fathers of the church in the two first</a>
<a id='line_650'>          centuries and later, formed almost all in the school of</a>
<a id='line_651'>          Alexandria, gave to the Logos of St. John a sense nearly</a>
<a id='line_652'>          similar to that which it received from Philo. Their doctrine</a>
<a id='line_653'>          approached very near to that which in the fourth century the</a>
<a id='line_654'>          council of Nice condemned in the person of Arius.ÑG.</a>
<a id='line_655'>          M. Guizot has forgotten the long residence of St. John at</a>
<a id='line_656'>          Ephesus, the centre of the mingling opinions of the East and</a>

<a id='line_761'>      The divine sanction, which the Apostle had bestowed on the</a>

<a id='line_763'>      learned proselytes of the second and third centuries to admire</a>
<a id='line_764'>      and study the writings of the Athenian sage, who had thus</a>
<a id='line_765'>      marvellously anticipated one of the most surprising discoveries</a>
<a id='line_766'>      of the Christian revelation. The respectable name of Plato was</a>
<a id='line_767'>      used by the orthodox, 29 and abused by the heretics, 30 as the</a>
<a id='line_768'>      common support of truth and error: the authority of his skilful</a>
<a id='line_769'>      commentators, and the science of dialectics, were employed to</a>
<a id='line_770'>      justify the remote consequences of his opinions and to supply the</a>
<a id='line_771'>      discreet silence of the inspired writers. The same subtle and</a>
<a id='line_772'>      profound questions concerning the nature, the generation, the</a>
<a id='line_773'>      distinction, and the equality of the three divine persons of the</a>
<a id='line_774'>      mysterious _Triad_, or _Trinity_, 31 were agitated in the</a>
<a id='line_775'>      philosophical and in the Christian schools of Alexandria. An</a>
<a id='line_776'>      eager spirit of curiosity urged them to explore the secrets of</a>
<a id='line_777'>      the abyss; and the pride of the professors, and of their</a>
<a id='line_778'>      disciples, was satisfied with the sciences of words. But the most</a>
<a id='line_779'>      sagacious of the Christian theologians, the great Athanasius</a>
<a id='line_780'>      himself, has candidly confessed, 32 that whenever he forced his</a>
<a id='line_781'>      understanding to meditate on the divinity of the _Logos_, his</a>
<a id='line_782'>      toilsome and unavailing efforts recoiled on themselves; that the</a>
<a id='line_783'>      more he thought, the less he comprehended; and the more he wrote,</a>
<a id='line_784'>      the less capable was he of expressing his thoughts. In every step</a>
<a id='line_785'>      of the inquiry, we are compelled to feel and acknowledge the</a>
<a id='line_786'>      immeasurable disproportion between the size of the object and the</a>
<a id='line_787'>      capacity of the human mind. We may strive to abstract the notions</a>
<a id='line_788'>      of time, of space, and of matter, which so closely adhere to all</a>

<a id='line_839'>      least exercised in the habits of abstract reasoning, aspired to</a>

<a id='line_849'>      business of the present, and the most useful preparation for a</a>
<a id='line_850'>      future, life. A theology, which it was incumbent to believe,</a>
<a id='line_851'>      which it was impious to doubt, and which it might be dangerous,</a>
<a id='line_852'>      and even fatal, to mistake, became the familiar topic of private</a>
<a id='line_853'>      meditation and popular discourse. The cold indifference of</a>
<a id='line_854'>      philosophy was inflamed by the fervent spirit of devotion; and</a>
<a id='line_855'>      even the metaphors of common language suggested the fallacious</a>
<a id='line_856'>      prejudices of sense and experience. The Christians, who abhorred</a>
<a id='line_857'>      the gross and impure generation of the Greek mythology, 35 were</a>
<a id='line_858'>      tempted to argue from the familiar analogy of the filial and</a>
<a id='line_859'>      paternal relations. The character of _Son_ seemed to imply a</a>
<a id='line_860'>      perpetual subordination to the voluntary author of his existence;</a>
<a id='line_861'>      36 but as the act of generation, in the most spiritual and</a>
<a id='line_862'>      abstracted sense, must be supposed to transmit the properties of</a>
<a id='line_863'>      a common nature, 37 they durst not presume to circumscribe the</a>
<a id='line_864'>      powers or the duration of the Son of an eternal and omnipotent</a>
<a id='line_865'>      Father. Fourscore years after the death of Christ, the Christians</a>
<a id='line_866'>      of Bithynia, declared before the tribunal of Pliny, that they</a>
<a id='line_867'>      invoked him as a god: and his divine honors have been perpetuated</a>
<a id='line_868'>      in every age and country, by the various sects who assume the</a>
<a id='line_869'>      name of his disciples. 38 Their tender reverence for the memory</a>
<a id='line_870'>      of Christ, and their horror for the profane worship of any</a>
<a id='line_871'>      created being, would have engaged them to assert the equal and</a>
<a id='line_872'>      absolute divinity of the _Logos_, if their rapid ascent towards</a>

<a id='line_941'>      distinguished the Christians from the Platonists: the second was</a>
<a id='line_942'>      the authority of the church. The disciples of philosophy asserted</a>
<a id='line_943'>      the rights of intellectual freedom, and their respect for the</a>
<a id='line_944'>      sentiments of their teachers was a liberal and voluntary tribute,</a>
<a id='line_945'>      which they offered to superior reason. But the Christians formed</a>
<a id='line_946'>      a numerous and disciplined society; and the jurisdiction of their</a>
<a id='line_947'>      laws and magistrates was strictly exercised over the minds of the</a>
<a id='line_948'>      faithful. The loose wanderings of the imagination were gradually</a>
<a id='line_949'>      confined by creeds and confessions; 40 the freedom of private</a>
<a id='line_950'>      judgment submitted to the public wisdom of synods; the authority</a>
<a id='line_951'>      of a theologian was determined by his ecclesiastical rank; and</a>
<a id='line_952'>      the episcopal successors of the apostles inflicted the censures</a>
<a id='line_953'>      of the church on those who deviated from the orthodox belief. But</a>
<a id='line_954'>      in an age of religious controversy, every act of oppression adds</a>
<a id='line_955'>      new force to the elastic vigor of the mind; and the zeal or</a>
<a id='line_956'>      obstinacy of a spiritual rebel was sometimes stimulated by secret</a>
<a id='line_957'>      motives of ambition or avarice. A metaphysical argument became</a>
<a id='line_958'>      the cause or pretence of political contests; the subtleties of</a>
<a id='line_959'>      the Platonic school were used as the badges of popular factions,</a>
<a id='line_960'>      and the distance which separated their respective tenets were</a>
<a id='line_961'>      enlarged or magnified by the acrimony of dispute. As long as the</a>
<a id='line_962'>      dark heresies of Praxeas and Sabellius labored to confound the</a>
<a id='line_963'>      _Father_ with the _Son_, 41 the orthodox party might be excused</a>
<a id='line_964'>      if they adhered more strictly and more earnestly to the</a>
<a id='line_965'>      _distinction_, than to the _equality_, of the divine persons. But</a>
<a id='line_966'>      as soon as the heat of controversy had subsided, and the progress</a>
<a id='line_967'>      of the Sabellians was no longer an object of terror to the</a>
<a id='line_968'>      churches of Rome, of Africa, or of Egypt, the tide of theological</a>
<a id='line_969'>      opinion began to flow with a gentle but steady motion towards the</a>
<a id='line_970'>      contrary extreme; and the most orthodox doctors allowed</a>
<a id='line_971'>      themselves the use of the terms and definitions which had been</a>
<a id='line_972'>      censured in the mouth of the sectaries. 42 After the edict of</a>
<a id='line_973'>      toleration had restored peace and leisure to the Christians, the</a>
<a id='line_974'>      Trinitarian controversy was revived in the ancient seat of</a>
<a id='line_975'>      Platonism, the learned, the opulent, the tumultuous city of</a>
<a id='line_976'>      Alexandria; and the flame of religious discord was rapidly</a>
<a id='line_977'>      communicated from the schools to the clergy, the people, the</a>
<a id='line_978'>      province, and the East. The abstruse question of the eternity of</a>
<a id='line_979'>      the _Logos_ was agitated in ecclesiastic conferences and popular</a>
<a id='line_980'>      sermons; and the heterodox opinions of Arius 43 were soon made</a>
<a id='line_981'>      public by his own zeal, and by that of his adversaries. His most</a>
<a id='line_982'>      implacable adversaries have acknowledged the learning and</a>
<a id='line_983'>      blameless life of that eminent presbyter, who, in a former</a>
<a id='line_984'>      election, had declared, and perhaps generously declined, his</a>
<a id='line_985'>      pretensions to the episcopal throne. 44 His competitor Alexander</a>
<a id='line_986'>      assumed the office of his judge. The important cause was argued</a>
<a id='line_987'>      before him; and if at first he seemed to hesitate, he at length</a>
<a id='line_988'>      pronounced his final sentence, as an absolute rule of faith. 45</a>

<a id='line_1205'>      Nazianzen, and the other pillars of the church, who supported</a>

<a id='line_1207'>      consider the expression of _substance_ as if it had been</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      synonymous with that of _nature;_ and they ventured to illustrate</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      their meaning, by affirming that three men, as they belong to the</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      same common species, are consubstantial, or homoousian to each</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      other. 58 This pure and distinct equality was tempered, on the</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      one hand, by the internal connection, and spiritual penetration</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      which indissolubly unites the divine persons; 59 and, on the</a>

<a id='line_1352'>      however, be noticed, as it served to produce and discriminate the</a>
<a id='line_1353'>      three sects, who were united only by their common aversion to the</a>
<a id='line_1354'>      Homoousion of the Nicene synod. 1. If they were asked whether the</a>
<a id='line_1355'>      Son was _like_ unto the Father, the question was resolutely</a>
<a id='line_1356'>      answered in the negative, by the heretics who adhered to the</a>
<a id='line_1357'>      principles of Arius, or indeed to those of philosophy; which seem</a>
<a id='line_1358'>      to establish an infinite difference between the Creator and the</a>
<a id='line_1359'>      most excellent of his creatures. This obvious consequence was</a>
<a id='line_1360'>      maintained by ®tius, 67 on whom the zeal of his adversaries</a>
<a id='line_1361'>      bestowed the surname of the Atheist. His restless and aspiring</a>
<a id='line_1362'>      spirit urged him to try almost every profession of human life. He</a>
<a id='line_1363'>      was successively a slave, or at least a husbandman, a travelling</a>
<a id='line_1364'>      tinker, a goldsmith, a physician, a schoolmaster, a theologian,</a>
<a id='line_1365'>      and at last the apostle of a new church, which was propagated by</a>
<a id='line_1366'>      the abilities of his disciple Eunomius. 68 Armed with texts of</a>
<a id='line_1367'>      Scripture, and with captious syllogisms from the logic of</a>
<a id='line_1368'>      Aristotle, the subtle ®tius had acquired the fame of an</a>
<a id='line_1369'>      invincible disputant, whom it was impossible either to silence or</a>
<a id='line_1370'>      to convince. Such talents engaged the friendship of the Arian</a>
<a id='line_1371'>      bishops, till they were forced to renounce, and even to</a>
<a id='line_1372'>      persecute, a dangerous ally, who, by the accuracy of his</a>
<a id='line_1373'>      reasoning, had prejudiced their cause in the popular opinion, and</a>
<a id='line_1374'>      offended the piety of their most devoted followers. 2. The</a>
<a id='line_1375'>      omnipotence of the Creator suggested a specious and respectful</a>
<a id='line_1376'>      solution of the _likeness_ of the Father and the Son; and faith</a>
<a id='line_1377'>      might humbly receive what reason could not presume to deny, that</a>
<a id='line_1378'>      the Supreme God might communicate his infinite perfections, and</a>
<a id='line_1379'>      create a being similar only to himself. 69 These Arians were</a>
<a id='line_1380'>      powerfully supported by the weight and abilities of their</a>
<a id='line_1381'>      leaders, who had succeeded to the management of the Eusebian</a>
<a id='line_1382'>      interest, and who occupied the principal thrones of the East.</a>
<a id='line_1383'>      They detested, perhaps with some affectation, the impiety of</a>
<a id='line_1384'>      ®tius; they professed to believe, either without reserve, or</a>
<a id='line_1385'>      according to the Scriptures, that the Son was different from all</a>
<a id='line_1386'>      _other_ creatures, and similar only to the Father. But they</a>
<a id='line_1387'>      denied, the he was either of the same, or of a similar substance;</a>
<a id='line_1388'>      sometimes boldly justifying their dissent, and sometimes</a>
<a id='line_1389'>      objecting to the use of the word substance, which seems to imply</a>
<a id='line_1390'>      an adequate, or at least, a distinct, notion of the nature of the</a>
<a id='line_1391'>      Deity. 3. The sect which deserted the doctrine of a similar</a>
<a id='line_1392'>      substance, was the most numerous, at least in the provinces of</a>
<a id='line_1393'>      Asia; and when the leaders of both parties were assembled in the</a>
<a id='line_1394'>      council of Seleucia, 70 _their_ opinion would have prevailed by a</a>
<a id='line_1395'>      majority of one hundred and five to forty-three bishops. The</a>
<a id='line_1396'>      Greek word, which was chosen to express this mysterious</a>
<a id='line_1397'>      resemblance, bears so close an affinity to the orthodox symbol,</a>

<a id='line_1406'>      Catholics themselves. The bishop of Poitiers, who in his Phrygian</a>

<a id='line_1478'>      surpassed in numbers the council of Nice, since it was composed</a>
<a id='line_1479'>      of above four hundred bishops of Italy, Africa, Spain, Gaul,</a>
<a id='line_1480'>      Britain, and Illyricum. From the first debates it appeared, that</a>
<a id='line_1481'>      only fourscore prelates adhered to the party, though _they_</a>
<a id='line_1482'>      affected to anathematize the name and memory, of Arius. But this</a>
<a id='line_1483'>      inferiority was compensated by the advantages of skill, of</a>
<a id='line_1484'>      experience, and of discipline; and the minority was conducted by</a>
<a id='line_1485'>      Valens and Ursacius, two bishops of Illyricum, who had spent</a>
<a id='line_1486'>      their lives in the intrigues of courts and councils, and who had</a>
<a id='line_1487'>      been trained under the Eusebian banner in the religious wars of</a>
<a id='line_1488'>      the East. By their arguments and negotiations, they embarrassed,</a>

<a id='line_1711'>      expressed towards the Eusebian faction, was insensibly fortified</a>
<a id='line_1712'>      by the dexterous management of their leaders; and his victory</a>

<a id='line_1804'>      readily confessed that his incapacity and ignorance were equal to</a>

<a id='line_1806'>      governed the vain and feeble mind of the emperor, had inspired</a>
<a id='line_1807'>      him with an insuperable dislike to the Homoousion; but his timid</a>
<a id='line_1808'>      conscience was alarmed by the impiety of ®tius. The guilt of that</a>
<a id='line_1809'>      atheist was aggravated by the suspicious favor of the unfortunate</a>
<a id='line_1810'>      Gallus; and even the death of the Imperial ministers, who had</a>
<a id='line_1811'>      been massacred at Antioch, were imputed to the suggestions of</a>
<a id='line_1812'>      that dangerous sophist. The mind of Constantius, which could</a>
<a id='line_1813'>      neither be moderated by reason, nor fixed by faith, was blindly</a>
<a id='line_1814'>      impelled to either side of the dark and empty abyss, by his</a>
<a id='line_1815'>      horror of the opposite extreme; he alternately embraced and</a>
<a id='line_1816'>      condemned the sentiments, he successively banished and recalled</a>
<a id='line_1817'>      the leaders, of the Arian and Semi-Arian factions. 94 During the</a>
<a id='line_1818'>      season of public business or festivity, he employed whole days,</a>
<a id='line_1819'>      and even nights, in selecting the words, and weighing the</a>
<a id='line_1820'>      syllables, which composed his fluctuating creeds. The subject of</a>
<a id='line_1821'>      his meditations still pursued and occupied his slumbers: the</a>
<a id='line_1822'>      incoherent dreams of the emperor were received as celestial</a>
<a id='line_1823'>      visions, and he accepted with complacency the lofty title of</a>
<a id='line_1824'>      bishop of bishops, from those ecclesiastics who forgot the</a>
<a id='line_1825'>      interest of their order for the gratification of their passions.</a>
<a id='line_1826'>      The design of establishing a uniformity of doctrine, which had</a>
<a id='line_1827'>      engaged him to convene so many synods in Gaul, Italy, Illyricum,</a>
<a id='line_1828'>      and Asia, was repeatedly baffled by his own levity, by the</a>
<a id='line_1829'>      divisions of the Arians, and by the resistance of the Catholics;</a>
<a id='line_1830'>      and he resolved, as the last and decisive effort, imperiously to</a>
<a id='line_1831'>      dictate the decrees of a general council. The destructive</a>
<a id='line_1832'>      earthquake of Nicomedia, the difficulty of finding a convenient</a>
<a id='line_1833'>      place, and perhaps some secret motives of policy, produced an</a>
<a id='line_1834'>      alteration in the summons. The bishops of the East were directed</a>
<a id='line_1835'>      to meet at Seleucia, in Isauria; while those of the West held</a>
<a id='line_1836'>      their deliberations at Rimini, on the coast of the Hadriatic; and</a>
<a id='line_1837'>      instead of two or three deputies from each province, the whole</a>
<a id='line_1838'>      episcopal body was ordered to march. The Eastern council, after</a>
<a id='line_1839'>      consuming four days in fierce and unavailing debate, separated</a>
<a id='line_1840'>      without any definitive conclusion. The council of the West was</a>
<a id='line_1841'>      protracted till the seventh month. Taurus, the Pr¾torian pr¾fect</a>
<a id='line_1842'>      was instructed not to dismiss the prelates till they should all</a>
<a id='line_1843'>      be united in the same opinion; and his efforts were supported by</a>
<a id='line_1844'>      the power of banishing fifteen of the most refractory, and a</a>
<a id='line_1845'>      promise of the consulship if he achieved so difficult an</a>

<a id='line_1849'>      at length extorted the reluctant consent of the bishops of</a>

<a id='line_2028'>      dictated the accusation, would direct the proceeding, and</a>
<a id='line_2029'>      pronounce the sentence. He prudently declined the tribunal of his</a>
<a id='line_2030'>      enemies; despised the summons of the synod of C¾sarea; and, after</a>
<a id='line_2031'>      a long and artful delay, submitted to the peremptory commands of</a>
<a id='line_2032'>      the emperor, who threatened to punish his criminal disobedience</a>

<a id='line_2034'>      Athanasius, at the head of fifty Egyptian prelates, sailed from</a>

<a id='line_2186'>      passed three years 112 as an exile and a suppliant on the holy</a>
<a id='line_2187'>      threshold of the Vatican. 113 By the assiduous study of the Latin</a>

<a id='line_2410'>      afterwards in the great council of Milan, 123 which consisted of</a>
<a id='line_2411'>      above three hundred bishops. Their integrity was gradually</a>
<a id='line_2412'>      undermined by the arguments of the Arians, the dexterity of the</a>
<a id='line_2413'>      eunuchs, and the pressing solicitations of a prince who gratified</a>
<a id='line_2414'>      his revenge at the expense of his dignity, and exposed his own</a>
<a id='line_2415'>      passions, whilst he influenced those of the clergy. Corruption,</a>
<a id='line_2416'>      the most infallible symptom of constitutional liberty, was</a>
<a id='line_2417'>      successfully practised; honors, gifts, and immunities were</a>

<a id='line_2423'>      spirit, which the sanctity of their character rendered less</a>

<a id='line_2603'>      the innocence of their spiritual father. Such extreme caution</a>
<a id='line_2604'>      afforded Athanasius a specious pretence respectfully to dispute</a>

<a id='line_2606'>      the equity, or with the former declarations, of his gracious</a>

<a id='line_2611'>      that all proceedings and all hostilities should be suspended till</a>

<a id='line_2616'>      or rather to surprise, a capital habituated to sedition, and</a>
<a id='line_2617'>      inflamed by religious zeal. 134 The position of Alexandria,</a>
<a id='line_2618'>      between the sea and the Lake Mareotis, facilitated the approach</a>

<a id='line_2622'>      the hour of midnight, twenty-three days after the signature of</a>
<a id='line_2623'>      the treaty, Syrianus, duke of Egypt, at the head of five thousand</a>

<a id='line_2626'>      part of his clergy and people, performed their nocturnal</a>
<a id='line_2627'>      devotions. The doors of the sacred edifice yielded to the</a>
<a id='line_2628'>      impetuosity of the attack, which was accompanied with every</a>
<a id='line_2629'>      horrid circumstance of tumult and bloodshed; but, as the bodies</a>

<a id='line_2631'>      next day an unexceptionable evidence in the possession of the</a>
<a id='line_2632'>      Catholics, the enterprise of Syrianus may be considered as a</a>
<a id='line_2633'>      successful irruption rather than as an absolute conquest. The</a>
<a id='line_2634'>      other churches of the city were profaned by similar outrages;</a>
<a id='line_2635'>      and, during at least four months, Alexandria was exposed to the</a>
<a id='line_2636'>      insults of a licentious army, stimulated by the ecclesiastics of</a>
<a id='line_2637'>      a hostile faction. Many of the faithful were killed; who may</a>

<a id='line_2642'>      under the mask of religious zeal, lust, avarice, and private</a>
<a id='line_2643'>      resentment were gratified with impunity, and even with applause.</a>
<a id='line_2644'>      The Pagans of Alexandria, who still formed a numerous and</a>
<a id='line_2645'>      discontented party, were easily persuaded to desert a bishop whom</a>

<a id='line_2647'>      the apprehension of being involved in the general penalties of</a>
<a id='line_2648'>      rebellion, engaged them to promise their support to the destined</a>
<a id='line_2649'>      successor of Athanasius, the famous George of Cappadocia. The</a>
<a id='line_2650'>      usurper, after receiving the consecration of an Arian synod, was</a>
<a id='line_2651'>      placed on the episcopal throne by the arms of Sebastian, who had</a>
<a id='line_2652'>      been appointed Count of Egypt for the execution of that important</a>
<a id='line_2653'>      design. In the use, as well as in the acquisition, of power, the</a>

<a id='line_2776'>      as messengers; but the importance of maintaining a more intimate</a>

<a id='line_2779'>      to introduce himself into Alexandria, and to trust his person to</a>
<a id='line_2780'>      the discretion of his friends and adherents. His various</a>
<a id='line_2781'>      adventures might have furnished the subject of a very</a>
<a id='line_2782'>      entertaining romance. He was once secreted in a dry cistern,</a>
<a id='line_2783'>      which he had scarcely left before he was betrayed by the</a>
<a id='line_2784'>      treachery of a female slave; 141 and he was once concealed in a</a>

<a id='line_2786'>      twenty years of age, and who was celebrated in the whole city for</a>
<a id='line_2787'>      her exquisite beauty. At the hour of midnight, as she related the</a>
<a id='line_2788'>      story many years afterwards, she was surprised by the appearance</a>
<a id='line_2789'>      of the archbishop in a loose undress, who, advancing with hasty</a>
<a id='line_2790'>      steps, conjured her to afford him the protection which he had</a>
<a id='line_2791'>      been directed by a celestial vision to seek under her hospitable</a>
<a id='line_2792'>      roof. The pious maid accepted and preserved the sacred pledge</a>
<a id='line_2793'>      which was intrusted to her prudence and courage. Without</a>
<a id='line_2794'>      imparting the secret to any one, she instantly conducted</a>
<a id='line_2795'>      Athanasius into her most secret chamber, and watched over his</a>
<a id='line_2796'>      safety with the tenderness of a friend and the assiduity of a</a>
<a id='line_2797'>      servant. As long as the danger continued, she regularly supplied</a>
<a id='line_2798'>      him with books and provisions, washed his feet, managed his</a>
<a id='line_2799'>      correspondence, and dexterously concealed from the eye of</a>

<a id='line_2804'>      repeated his visits to his fair and faithful companion; and the</a>
<a id='line_2805'>      formal declaration, that he _saw_ the councils of Rimini and</a>
<a id='line_2806'>      Seleucia, 143 forces us to believe that he was secretly present</a>
<a id='line_2807'>      at the time and place of their convocation. The advantage of</a>
<a id='line_2808'>      personally negotiating with his friends, and of observing and</a>
<a id='line_2809'>      improving the divisions of his enemies, might justify, in a</a>

<a id='line_2811'>      Alexandria was connected by trade and navigation with every</a>

<a id='line_2814'>      against the protector of the Arians; and his seasonable writings,</a>
<a id='line_2815'>      which were diligently circulated and eagerly perused, contributed</a>
<a id='line_2816'>      to unite and animate the orthodox party. In his public apologies,</a>
<a id='line_2817'>      which he addressed to the emperor himself, he sometimes affected</a>
<a id='line_2818'>      the praise of moderation; whilst at the same time, in secret and</a>
<a id='line_2819'>      vehement invectives, he exposed Constantius as a weak and wicked</a>

<a id='line_2977'>      the oblations of an heretical prince. When the eunuchs had</a>

<a id='line_2979'>      apprehension of a tumult engaged them to use the utmost</a>
<a id='line_2980'>      precautions in the execution of the sentence. The capital was</a>
<a id='line_2981'>      invested on every side, and the pr¾fect was commanded to seize</a>

<a id='line_2985'>      the Roman people, before their consternation was turned into</a>
<a id='line_2986'>      rage. As soon as they were informed of his banishment into</a>
<a id='line_2987'>      Thrace, a general assembly was convened, and the clergy of Rome</a>
<a id='line_2988'>      bound themselves, by a public and solemn oath, never to desert</a>
<a id='line_2989'>      their bishop, never to acknowledge the usurper F¾lix; who, by the</a>
<a id='line_2990'>      influence of the eunuchs, had been irregularly chosen and</a>
<a id='line_2991'>      consecrated within the walls of a profane palace. At the end of</a>
<a id='line_2992'>      two years, their pious obstinacy subsisted entire and unshaken;</a>
<a id='line_2993'>      and when Constantius visited Rome, he was assailed by the</a>
<a id='line_2994'>      importunate solicitations of a people, who had preserved, as the</a>
<a id='line_2995'>      last remnant of their ancient freedom, the right of treating</a>

<a id='line_2998'>      husbands to intercede in favor of Liberius, were advised to</a>
<a id='line_2999'>      undertake a commission, which in their hands would be less</a>

<a id='line_3005'>      that the two bishops, Liberius and F¾lix, should govern in peace</a>

<a id='line_3037'>      faction of Infidels, who envied the prosperity, and who</a>
<a id='line_3038'>      ridiculed, even in their theatres, the theological disputes of</a>
<a id='line_3039'>      the church. Constantinople alone enjoyed the advantage of being</a>
<a id='line_3040'>      born and educated in the bosom of the faith. The capital of the</a>
<a id='line_3041'>      East had never been polluted by the worship of idols; and the</a>
<a id='line_3042'>      whole body of the people had deeply imbibed the opinions, the</a>
<a id='line_3043'>      virtues, and the passions, which distinguished the Christians of</a>
<a id='line_3044'>      that age from the rest of mankind. After the death of Alexander,</a>
<a id='line_3045'>      the episcopal throne was disputed by Paul and Macedonius. By</a>
<a id='line_3046'>      their zeal and abilities they both deserved the eminent station</a>
<a id='line_3047'>      to which they aspired; and if the moral character of Macedonius</a>
<a id='line_3048'>      was less exceptionable, his competitor had the advantage of a</a>
<a id='line_3049'>      prior election and a more orthodox doctrine. His firm attachment</a>
<a id='line_3050'>      to the Nicene creed, which has given Paul a place in the calendar</a>
<a id='line_3051'>      among saints and martyrs, exposed him to the resentment of the</a>
<a id='line_3052'>      Arians. In the space of fourteen years he was five times driven</a>
<a id='line_3053'>      from his throne; to which he was more frequently restored by the</a>
<a id='line_3054'>      violence of the people, than by the permission of the prince; and</a>
<a id='line_3055'>      the power of Macedonius could be secured only by the death of his</a>
<a id='line_3056'>      rival. The unfortunate Paul was dragged in chains from the sandy</a>
<a id='line_3057'>      deserts of Mesopotamia to the most desolate places of Mount</a>
<a id='line_3058'>      Taurus, 150 confined in a dark and narrow dungeon, left six days</a>
<a id='line_3059'>      without food, and at length strangled, by the order of Philip,</a>

<a id='line_3061'>      The first blood which stained the new capital was spilt in this</a>
<a id='line_3062'>      ecclesiastical contest; and many persons were slain on both</a>
<a id='line_3063'>      sides, in the furious and obstinate seditions of the people. The</a>
<a id='line_3064'>      commission of enforcing a sentence of banishment against Paul had</a>
<a id='line_3065'>      been intrusted to Hermogenes, the master-general of the cavalry;</a>
<a id='line_3066'>      but the execution of it was fatal to himself. The Catholics rose</a>
<a id='line_3067'>      in the defence of their bishop; the palace of Hermogenes was</a>
<a id='line_3068'>      consumed; the first military officer of the empire was dragged by</a>
<a id='line_3069'>      the heels through the streets of Constantinople, and, after he</a>
<a id='line_3070'>      expired, his lifeless corpse was exposed to their wanton insults.</a>
<a id='line_3071'>      152 The fate of Hermogenes instructed Philip, the Pr¾torian</a>
<a id='line_3072'>      pr¾fect, to act with more precaution on a similar occasion. In</a>
<a id='line_3073'>      the most gentle and honorable terms, he required the attendance</a>
<a id='line_3074'>      of Paul in the baths of Xeuxippus, which had a private</a>
<a id='line_3075'>      communication with the palace and the sea. A vessel, which lay</a>
<a id='line_3076'>      ready at the garden stairs, immediately hoisted sail; and, while</a>
<a id='line_3077'>      the people were still ignorant of the meditated sacrilege, their</a>
<a id='line_3078'>      bishop was already embarked on his voyage to Thessalonica. They</a>
<a id='line_3079'>      soon beheld, with surprise and indignation, the gates of the</a>
<a id='line_3080'>      palace thrown open, and the usurper Macedonius seated by the side</a>
<a id='line_3081'>      of the pr¾fect on a lofty chariot, which was surrounded by troops</a>
<a id='line_3082'>      of guards with drawn swords. The military procession advanced</a>
<a id='line_3083'>      towards the cathedral; the Arians and the Catholics eagerly</a>
<a id='line_3084'>      rushed to occupy that important post; and three thousand one</a>
<a id='line_3085'>      hundred and fifty persons lost their lives in the confusion of</a>
<a id='line_3086'>      the tumult. Macedonius, who was supported by a regular force,</a>
<a id='line_3087'>      obtained a decisive victory; but his reign was disturbed by</a>
<a id='line_3088'>      clamor and sedition; and the causes which appeared the least</a>
<a id='line_3089'>      connected with the subject of dispute, were sufficient to nourish</a>
<a id='line_3090'>      and to kindle the flame of civil discord. As the chapel in which</a>
<a id='line_3091'>      the body of the great Constantine had been deposited was in a</a>
<a id='line_3092'>      ruinous condition, the bishop transported those venerable remains</a>
<a id='line_3093'>      into the church of St. Acacius. This prudent and even pious</a>
<a id='line_3094'>      measure was represented as a wicked profanation by the whole</a>
<a id='line_3095'>      party which adhered to the Homoousian doctrine. The factions</a>
<a id='line_3096'>      immediately flew to arms, the consecrated ground was used as</a>
<a id='line_3097'>      their field of battle; and one of the ecclesiastical historians</a>

<a id='line_3232'>      were imperfectly converted to the Christian faith; but who were</a>
<a id='line_3233'>      actuated by a blind and furious enthusiasm in the cause of their</a>

<a id='line_3235'>      bishops, the demolition of their churches, and the interruption</a>
<a id='line_3236'>      of their secret assemblies. The violence of the officers of</a>

<a id='line_3248'>      by the name of religion, and faintly condemned by the doctors of</a>

<a id='line_3255'>      Africa. At first their depredations were colored by the plea of</a>

<a id='line_3266'>      provoked them to acts of violence and murder; and some Catholic</a>

<a id='line_3415'>      the abuses, of the ancient religion. After the example of the</a>

<a id='line_3418'>      excited the vain hopes, and sometimes the criminal attempts, of</a>
