<a id='line_39'>KING JOHN's palace</a>
<a id='line_40'></a>
<a id='line_41'>Enter KING JOHN, QUEEN ELINOR, PEMBROKE, ESSEX, SALISBURY, and others,</a>
<a id='line_42'>with CHATILLON</a>
<a id='line_43'></a>
<a id='line_44'>  KING JOHN. Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?</a>
<a id='line_45'>  CHATILLON. Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France</a>
<a id='line_46'>    In my behaviour to the majesty,</a>
<a id='line_47'>    The borrowed majesty, of England here.</a>
<a id='line_48'>  ELINOR. A strange beginning- 'borrowed majesty'!</a>
<a id='line_49'>  KING JOHN. Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.</a>
<a id='line_50'>  CHATILLON. Philip of France, in right and true behalf</a>
<a id='line_51'>    Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,</a>
<a id='line_52'>    Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim</a>
<a id='line_53'>    To this fair island and the territories,</a>
<a id='line_54'>    To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,</a>
<a id='line_55'>    Desiring thee to lay aside the sword</a>
<a id='line_56'>    Which sways usurpingly these several titles,</a>
<a id='line_57'>    And put the same into young Arthur's hand,</a>
<a id='line_58'>    Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.</a>
<a id='line_59'>  KING JOHN. What follows if we disallow of this?</a>
<a id='line_60'>  CHATILLON. The proud control of fierce and bloody war,</a>
<a id='line_61'>    To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.</a>
<a id='line_62'>  KING JOHN. Here have we war for war, and blood for blood,</a>
<a id='line_63'>    Controlment for controlment- so answer France.</a>
<a id='line_64'>  CHATILLON. Then take my king's defiance from my mouth-</a>
<a id='line_65'>    The farthest limit of my embassy.</a>
<a id='line_66'>  KING JOHN. Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace;</a>
<a id='line_67'>    Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;</a>
<a id='line_68'>    For ere thou canst report I will be there,</a>
<a id='line_69'>    The thunder of my cannon shall be heard.</a>
<a id='line_70'>    So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath</a>
<a id='line_71'>    And sullen presage of your own decay.</a>
<a id='line_72'>    An honourable conduct let him have-</a>
<a id='line_73'>    Pembroke, look to 't. Farewell, Chatillon.</a>
<a id='line_74'>                                        Exeunt CHATILLON and PEMBROKE</a>
<a id='line_75'>  ELINOR. What now, my son! Have I not ever said</a>
<a id='line_76'>    How that ambitious Constance would not cease</a>
<a id='line_77'>    Till she had kindled France and all the world</a>
<a id='line_78'>    Upon the right and party of her son?</a>
<a id='line_79'>    This might have been prevented and made whole</a>
<a id='line_80'>    With very easy arguments of love,</a>
<a id='line_81'>    Which now the manage of two kingdoms must</a>
<a id='line_82'>    With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.</a>
<a id='line_83'>  KING JOHN. Our strong possession and our right for us!</a>
<a id='line_84'>  ELINOR. Your strong possession much more than your right,</a>
<a id='line_85'>    Or else it must go wrong with you and me;</a>
<a id='line_86'>    So much my conscience whispers in your ear,</a>
<a id='line_87'>    Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.</a>
<a id='line_88'></a>
<a id='line_89'>                  Enter a SHERIFF</a>
<a id='line_90'></a>
<a id='line_91'>  ESSEX. My liege, here is the strangest controversy</a>
<a id='line_92'>    Come from the country to be judg'd by you</a>
<a id='line_93'>    That e'er I heard. Shall I produce the men?</a>
<a id='line_94'>  KING JOHN. Let them approach.                          Exit SHERIFF</a>
<a id='line_95'>    Our abbeys and our priories shall pay</a>
<a id='line_96'>    This expedition's charge.</a>
<a id='line_97'></a>
<a id='line_98'>     Enter ROBERT FAULCONBRIDGE and PHILIP, his bastard</a>
<a id='line_99'>                     brother</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>    What men are you?</a>
<a id='line_102'>  BASTARD. Your faithful subject I, a gentleman</a>
<a id='line_103'>    Born in Northamptonshire, and eldest son,</a>
<a id='line_104'>    As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge-</a>
<a id='line_105'>    A soldier by the honour-giving hand</a>
<a id='line_106'>    Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.</a>
<a id='line_107'>  KING JOHN. What art thou?</a>
<a id='line_108'>  ROBERT. The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.</a>
<a id='line_109'>  KING JOHN. Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?</a>
<a id='line_110'>    You came not of one mother then, it seems.</a>
<a id='line_111'>  BASTARD. Most certain of one mother, mighty king-</a>
<a id='line_112'>    That is well known- and, as I think, one father;</a>
<a id='line_113'>    But for the certain knowledge of that truth</a>
<a id='line_114'>    I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother.</a>
<a id='line_115'>    Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.</a>
<a id='line_116'>  ELINOR. Out on thee, rude man! Thou dost shame thy mother,</a>
<a id='line_117'>    And wound her honour with this diffidence.</a>
<a id='line_118'>  BASTARD. I, madam? No, I have no reason for it-</a>
<a id='line_119'>    That is my brother's plea, and none of mine;</a>
<a id='line_120'>    The which if he can prove, 'a pops me out</a>
<a id='line_121'>    At least from fair five hundred pound a year.</a>
<a id='line_122'>    Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!</a>
<a id='line_123'>  KING JOHN. A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,</a>
<a id='line_124'>    Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?</a>
<a id='line_125'>  BASTARD. I know not why, except to get the land.</a>
<a id='line_126'>    But once he slander'd me with bastardy;</a>
<a id='line_127'>    But whe'er I be as true begot or no,</a>
<a id='line_128'>    That still I lay upon my mother's head;</a>
<a id='line_129'>    But that I am as well begot, my liege-</a>
<a id='line_130'>    Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!-</a>
<a id='line_131'>    Compare our faces and be judge yourself.</a>
<a id='line_132'>    If old Sir Robert did beget us both</a>
<a id='line_133'>    And were our father, and this son like him-</a>
<a id='line_134'>    O old Sir Robert, father, on my knee</a>
<a id='line_135'>    I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!</a>
<a id='line_136'>  KING JOHN. Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!</a>
<a id='line_137'>  ELINOR. He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;</a>
<a id='line_138'>    The accent of his tongue affecteth him.</a>
<a id='line_139'>    Do you not read some tokens of my son</a>
<a id='line_140'>    In the large composition of this man?</a>
<a id='line_141'>  KING JOHN. Mine eye hath well examined his parts</a>
<a id='line_142'>    And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,</a>
<a id='line_143'>    What doth move you to claim your brother's land?</a>
<a id='line_144'>  BASTARD. Because he hath a half-face, like my father.</a>
<a id='line_145'>    With half that face would he have all my land:</a>
<a id='line_146'>    A half-fac'd groat five hundred pound a year!</a>
<a id='line_147'>  ROBERT. My gracious liege, when that my father liv'd,</a>
<a id='line_148'>    Your brother did employ my father much-</a>
<a id='line_149'>  BASTARD. Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:</a>
<a id='line_150'>    Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.</a>
<a id='line_151'>  ROBERT. And once dispatch'd him in an embassy</a>
<a id='line_152'>    To Germany, there with the Emperor</a>
<a id='line_153'>    To treat of high affairs touching that time.</a>
<a id='line_154'>    Th' advantage of his absence took the King,</a>
<a id='line_155'>    And in the meantime sojourn'd at my father's;</a>
<a id='line_156'>    Where how he did prevail I shame to speak-</a>
<a id='line_157'>    But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores</a>
<a id='line_158'>    Between my father and my mother lay,</a>
<a id='line_159'>    As I have heard my father speak himself,</a>
<a id='line_160'>    When this same lusty gentleman was got.</a>
<a id='line_161'>    Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd</a>
<a id='line_162'>    His lands to me, and took it on his death</a>
<a id='line_163'>    That this my mother's son was none of his;</a>
<a id='line_164'>    And if he were, he came into the world</a>
<a id='line_165'>    Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.</a>
<a id='line_166'>    Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,</a>
<a id='line_167'>    My father's land, as was my father's will.</a>
<a id='line_168'>  KING JOHN. Sirrah, your brother is legitimate:</a>
<a id='line_169'>    Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,</a>
<a id='line_170'>    And if she did play false, the fault was hers;</a>
<a id='line_171'>    Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands</a>
<a id='line_172'>    That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,</a>
<a id='line_173'>    Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,</a>
<a id='line_174'>    Had of your father claim'd this son for his?</a>
<a id='line_175'>    In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept</a>
<a id='line_176'>    This calf, bred from his cow, from all the world;</a>
<a id='line_177'>    In sooth, he might; then, if he were my brother's,</a>
<a id='line_178'>    My brother might not claim him; nor your father,</a>
<a id='line_179'>    Being none of his, refuse him. This concludes:</a>
<a id='line_180'>    My mother's son did get your father's heir;</a>
<a id='line_181'>    Your father's heir must have your father's land.</a>
<a id='line_182'>  ROBERT. Shall then my father's will be of no force</a>
<a id='line_183'>    To dispossess that child which is not his?</a>
<a id='line_184'>  BASTARD. Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,</a>
<a id='line_185'>    Than was his will to get me, as I think.</a>
<a id='line_186'>  ELINOR. Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge,</a>
<a id='line_187'>    And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,</a>
<a id='line_188'>    Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,</a>
<a id='line_189'>    Lord of thy presence and no land beside?</a>
<a id='line_190'>  BASTARD. Madam, an if my brother had my shape</a>
<a id='line_191'>    And I had his, Sir Robert's his, like him;</a>
<a id='line_192'>    And if my legs were two such riding-rods,</a>
<a id='line_193'>    My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin</a>
<a id='line_194'>    That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose</a>
<a id='line_195'>    Lest men should say 'Look where three-farthings goes!'</a>
<a id='line_196'>    And, to his shape, were heir to all this land-</a>
<a id='line_197'>    Would I might never stir from off this place,</a>
<a id='line_198'>    I would give it every foot to have this face!</a>
<a id='line_199'>    I would not be Sir Nob in any case.</a>
<a id='line_200'>  ELINOR. I like thee well. Wilt thou forsake thy fortune,</a>
<a id='line_201'>    Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?</a>
<a id='line_202'>    I am a soldier and now bound to France.</a>
<a id='line_203'>  BASTARD. Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.</a>
<a id='line_204'>    Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,</a>
<a id='line_205'>    Yet sell your face for fivepence and 'tis dear.</a>
<a id='line_206'>    Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.</a>
<a id='line_207'>  ELINOR. Nay, I would have you go before me thither.</a>
<a id='line_208'>  BASTARD. Our country manners give our betters way.</a>
<a id='line_209'>  KING JOHN. What is thy name?</a>
<a id='line_210'>  BASTARD. Philip, my liege, so is my name begun:</a>
<a id='line_211'>    Philip, good old Sir Robert's wife's eldest son.</a>
<a id='line_212'>  KING JOHN. From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bearest:</a>
<a id='line_213'>    Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great-</a>
<a id='line_214'>    Arise Sir Richard and Plantagenet.</a>
<a id='line_215'>  BASTARD. Brother by th' mother's side, give me your hand;</a>
<a id='line_216'>    My father gave me honour, yours gave land.</a>
<a id='line_217'>    Now blessed be the hour, by night or day,</a>
<a id='line_218'>    When I was got, Sir Robert was away!</a>
<a id='line_219'>  ELINOR. The very spirit of Plantagenet!</a>
<a id='line_220'>    I am thy grandam, Richard: call me so.</a>
<a id='line_221'>  BASTARD. Madam, by chance, but not by truth; what though?</a>
<a id='line_222'>    Something about, a little from the right,</a>
<a id='line_223'>    In at the window, or else o'er the hatch;</a>
<a id='line_224'>    Who dares not stir by day must walk by night;</a>
<a id='line_225'>    And have is have, however men do catch.</a>
<a id='line_226'>    Near or far off, well won is still well shot;</a>
<a id='line_227'>    And I am I, howe'er I was begot.</a>
<a id='line_228'>  KING JOHN. Go, Faulconbridge; now hast thou thy desire:</a>
<a id='line_229'>    A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.</a>
<a id='line_230'>    Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed</a>
<a id='line_231'>    For France, for France, for it is more than need.</a>
<a id='line_232'>  BASTARD. Brother, adieu. Good fortune come to thee!</a>
<a id='line_233'>    For thou wast got i' th' way of honesty.</a>
<a id='line_234'>                                           Exeunt all but the BASTARD</a>
<a id='line_235'>    A foot of honour better than I was;</a>
<a id='line_236'>    But many a many foot of land the worse.</a>
<a id='line_237'>    Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.</a>
<a id='line_238'>    'Good den, Sir Richard!'-'God-a-mercy, fellow!'</a>
<a id='line_239'>    And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;</a>
<a id='line_240'>    For new-made honour doth forget men's names:</a>
<a id='line_241'>    'Tis too respective and too sociable</a>
<a id='line_242'>    For your conversion. Now your traveller,</a>
<a id='line_243'>    He and his toothpick at my worship's mess-</a>
<a id='line_244'>    And when my knightly stomach is suffic'd,</a>
<a id='line_245'>    Why then I suck my teeth and catechize</a>
<a id='line_246'>    My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'</a>
<a id='line_247'>    Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin</a>
<a id='line_248'>    'I shall beseech you'-That is question now;</a>
<a id='line_249'>    And then comes answer like an Absey book:</a>
<a id='line_250'>    'O sir,' says answer 'at your best command,</a>
<a id='line_251'>    At your employment, at your service, sir!'</a>
<a id='line_252'>    'No, sir,' says question 'I, sweet sir, at yours.'</a>
<a id='line_253'>    And so, ere answer knows what question would,</a>
<a id='line_254'>    Saving in dialogue of compliment,</a>
<a id='line_255'>    And talking of the Alps and Apennines,</a>
<a id='line_256'>    The Pyrenean and the river Po-</a>
<a id='line_257'>    It draws toward supper in conclusion so.</a>
<a id='line_258'>    But this is worshipful society,</a>
<a id='line_259'>    And fits the mounting spirit like myself;</a>
<a id='line_260'>    For he is but a bastard to the time</a>
<a id='line_261'>    That doth not smack of observation-</a>
<a id='line_262'>    And so am I, whether I smack or no;</a>
<a id='line_263'>    And not alone in habit and device,</a>
<a id='line_264'>    Exterior form, outward accoutrement,</a>
<a id='line_265'>    But from the inward motion to deliver</a>
<a id='line_266'>    Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth;</a>
<a id='line_267'>    Which, though I will not practise to deceive,</a>
<a id='line_268'>    Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;</a>
<a id='line_269'>    For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.</a>
<a id='line_270'>    But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?</a>
<a id='line_271'>    What woman-post is this? Hath she no husband</a>
<a id='line_272'>    That will take pains to blow a horn before her?</a>
<a id='line_273'></a>
<a id='line_274'>      Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE, and JAMES GURNEY</a>
<a id='line_275'></a>
<a id='line_276'>    O me, 'tis my mother! How now, good lady!</a>
<a id='line_277'>    What brings you here to court so hastily?</a>
<a id='line_278'>  LADY FAULCONBRIDGE. Where is that slave, thy brother?</a>
<a id='line_279'>      Where is he</a>

<a id='line_287'>  BASTARD. James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?</a>
<a id='line_288'>  GURNEY. Good leave, good Philip.</a>
<a id='line_289'>  BASTARD. Philip-Sparrow! James,</a>
<a id='line_290'>    There's toys abroad-anon I'll tell thee more.</a>

<a id='line_292'>    Madam, I was not old Sir Robert's son;</a>

<a id='line_296'>    Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:</a>
<a id='line_297'>    We know his handiwork. Therefore, good mother,</a>
<a id='line_298'>    To whom am I beholding for these limbs?</a>
<a id='line_299'>    Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.</a>
<a id='line_300'>  LADY FAULCONBRIDGE. Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,</a>

<a id='line_302'>    What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?</a>
<a id='line_303'>  BASTARD. Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.</a>
<a id='line_304'>    What! I am dubb'd; I have it on my shoulder.</a>

<a id='line_308'>    Then, good my mother, let me know my father-</a>

<a id='line_310'>  LADY FAULCONBRIDGE. Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?</a>
<a id='line_311'>  BASTARD. As faithfully as I deny the devil.</a>
<a id='line_312'>  LADY FAULCONBRIDGE. King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father.</a>

<a id='line_320'>    Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,</a>

<a id='line_322'>    Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,</a>
<a id='line_323'>    Subjected tribute to commanding love,</a>
<a id='line_324'>    Against whose fury and unmatched force</a>

<a id='line_344'></a>

<a id='line_346'>    Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,</a>

<a id='line_348'>    And fought the holy wars in Palestine,</a>
<a id='line_349'>    By this brave duke came early to his grave;</a>

<a id='line_351'>    At our importance hither is he come</a>
<a id='line_352'>    To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf;</a>
<a id='line_353'>    And to rebuke the usurpation</a>
<a id='line_354'>    Of thy unnatural uncle, English John.</a>
<a id='line_355'>    Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.</a>
<a id='line_356'>  ARTHUR. God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death</a>
<a id='line_357'>    The rather that you give his offspring life,</a>
<a id='line_358'>    Shadowing their right under your wings of war.</a>
<a id='line_359'>    I give you welcome with a powerless hand,</a>
<a id='line_360'>    But with a heart full of unstained love;</a>
<a id='line_361'>    Welcome before the gates of Angiers, Duke.</a>
<a id='line_362'>  KING PHILIP. A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?</a>
<a id='line_363'>  AUSTRIA. Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss</a>
<a id='line_364'>    As seal to this indenture of my love:</a>
<a id='line_365'>    That to my home I will no more return</a>
<a id='line_366'>    Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,</a>
<a id='line_367'>    Together with that pale, that white-fac'd shore,</a>
<a id='line_368'>    Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides</a>
<a id='line_369'>    And coops from other lands her islanders-</a>
<a id='line_370'>    Even till that England, hedg'd in with the main,</a>
<a id='line_371'>    That water-walled bulwark, still secure</a>

<a id='line_373'>    Even till that utmost corner of the west</a>
<a id='line_374'>    Salute thee for her king. Till then, fair boy,</a>
<a id='line_375'>    Will I not think of home, but follow arms.</a>
<a id='line_376'>  CONSTANCE. O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,</a>
<a id='line_377'>    Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength</a>
<a id='line_378'>    To make a more requital to your love!</a>
<a id='line_379'>  AUSTRIA. The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords</a>
<a id='line_380'>    In such a just and charitable war.</a>
<a id='line_381'>  KING PHILIP. Well then, to work! Our cannon shall be bent</a>
<a id='line_382'>    Against the brows of this resisting town;</a>
<a id='line_383'>    Call for our chiefest men of discipline,</a>
<a id='line_384'>    To cull the plots of best advantages.</a>
<a id='line_385'>    We'll lay before this town our royal bones,</a>
<a id='line_386'>    Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood,</a>
<a id='line_387'>    But we will make it subject to this boy.</a>
<a id='line_388'>  CONSTANCE. Stay for an answer to your embassy,</a>
<a id='line_389'>    Lest unadvis'd you stain your swords with blood;</a>
<a id='line_390'>    My Lord Chatillon may from England bring</a>

<a id='line_397'>  KING PHILIP. A wonder, lady! Lo, upon thy wish,</a>
<a id='line_398'>    Our messenger Chatillon is arriv'd.</a>
<a id='line_399'>    What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;</a>
<a id='line_400'>    We coldly pause for thee. Chatillon, speak.</a>
<a id='line_401'>  CHATILLON. Then turn your forces from this paltry siege</a>
<a id='line_402'>    And stir them up against a mightier task.</a>
<a id='line_403'>    England, impatient of your just demands,</a>
<a id='line_404'>    Hath put himself in arms. The adverse winds,</a>
<a id='line_405'>    Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time</a>
<a id='line_406'>    To land his legions all as soon as I;</a>
<a id='line_407'>    His marches are expedient to this town,</a>

<a id='line_417'>    Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,</a>
<a id='line_418'>    To make a hazard of new fortunes here.</a>
<a id='line_419'>    In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits</a>
<a id='line_420'>    Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er</a>

<a id='line_424'>    Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand;</a>
<a id='line_425'>    To parley or to fight, therefore prepare.</a>
<a id='line_426'>  KING PHILIP. How much unlook'd for is this expedition!</a>
<a id='line_427'>  AUSTRIA. By how much unexpected, by so much</a>
<a id='line_428'>    We must awake endeavour for defence,</a>
<a id='line_429'>    For courage mounteth with occasion.</a>
<a id='line_430'>    Let them be welcome then; we are prepar'd.</a>

<a id='line_444'>    This toil of ours should be a work of thine;</a>

<a id='line_447'>    Cut off the sequence of posterity,</a>
<a id='line_448'>    Outfaced infant state, and done a rape</a>
<a id='line_449'>    Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.</a>

<a id='line_457'>    And this is Geffrey's. In the name of God,</a>
<a id='line_458'>    How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,</a>
<a id='line_459'>    When living blood doth in these temples beat</a>
<a id='line_460'>    Which owe the crown that thou o'er-masterest?</a>

<a id='line_462'>    To draw my answer from thy articles?</a>
<a id='line_463'>  KING PHILIP. From that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts</a>

<a id='line_465'>    To look into the blots and stains of right.</a>
<a id='line_466'>    That judge hath made me guardian to this boy,</a>

<a id='line_469'>  KING JOHN. Alack, thou dost usurp authority.</a>
<a id='line_470'>  KING PHILIP. Excuse it is to beat usurping down.</a>
<a id='line_471'>  ELINOR. Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?</a>
<a id='line_472'>  CONSTANCE. Let me make answer: thy usurping son.</a>
<a id='line_473'>  ELINOR. Out, insolent! Thy bastard shall be king,</a>
<a id='line_474'>    That thou mayst be a queen and check the world!</a>
<a id='line_475'>  CONSTANCE. My bed was ever to thy son as true</a>

<a id='line_495'>    That did disrobe the lion of that robe!</a>
<a id='line_496'>  BASTARD. It lies as sightly on the back of him</a>

<a id='line_594'>    Craves harbourage within your city walls.</a>
<a id='line_595'>  KING PHILIP. When I have said, make answer to us both.</a>
<a id='line_596'>    Lo, in this right hand, whose protection</a>
<a id='line_597'>    Is most divinely vow'd upon the right</a>
<a id='line_598'>    Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,</a>
<a id='line_599'>    Son to the elder brother of this man,</a>
<a id='line_600'>    And king o'er him and all that he enjoys;</a>
<a id='line_601'>    For this down-trodden equity we tread</a>
<a id='line_602'>    In warlike march these greens before your town,</a>

<a id='line_604'>    Than the constraint of hospitable zeal</a>
<a id='line_605'>    In the relief of this oppressed child</a>
<a id='line_606'>    Religiously provokes. Be pleased then</a>
<a id='line_607'>    To pay that duty which you truly owe</a>
<a id='line_608'>    To him that owes it, namely, this young prince;</a>
<a id='line_609'>    And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,</a>
<a id='line_610'>    Save in aspect, hath all offence seal'd up;</a>
<a id='line_611'>    Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent</a>
<a id='line_612'>    Against th' invulnerable clouds of heaven;</a>

<a id='line_614'>    With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruis'd,</a>
<a id='line_615'>    We will bear home that lusty blood again</a>
<a id='line_616'>    Which here we came to spout against your town,</a>

<a id='line_634'>    And if not that, I bring you witnesses:</a>

<a id='line_772'>  BASTARD. An if thou hast the mettle of a king,</a>

<a id='line_777'>    Why then defy each other, and pell-mell</a>
<a id='line_778'>    Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.</a>
<a id='line_779'>  KING PHILIP. Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?</a>
<a id='line_780'>  KING JOHN. We from the west will send destruction</a>
<a id='line_781'>    Into this city's bosom.</a>
<a id='line_782'>  AUSTRIA. I from the north.</a>

<a id='line_791'>    Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds</a>
<a id='line_792'>    That here come sacrifices for the field.</a>
<a id='line_793'>    Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.</a>
<a id='line_794'>  KING JOHN. Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.</a>
<a id='line_795'>  CITIZEN. That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,</a>

<a id='line_798'>    If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,</a>
<a id='line_799'>    Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?</a>

<a id='line_803'>    Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?</a>
<a id='line_804'>    Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,</a>
<a id='line_805'>    Is the young Dauphin every way complete-</a>
<a id='line_806'>    If not complete of, say he is not she;</a>
<a id='line_807'>    And she again wants nothing, to name want,</a>
<a id='line_808'>    If want it be not that she is not he.</a>
<a id='line_809'>    He is the half part of a blessed man,</a>

<a id='line_811'>    And she a fair divided excellence,</a>
<a id='line_812'>    Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.</a>
<a id='line_813'>    O, two such silver currents, when they join,</a>
<a id='line_814'>    Do glorify the banks that bound them in;</a>
<a id='line_815'>    And two such shores to two such streams made one,</a>
<a id='line_816'>    Two such controlling bounds, shall you be, Kings,</a>
<a id='line_817'>    To these two princes, if you marry them.</a>
<a id='line_818'>    This union shall do more than battery can</a>

<a id='line_820'>    With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,</a>
<a id='line_821'>    The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope</a>
<a id='line_822'>    And give you entrance; but without this match,</a>

<a id='line_824'>    Lions more confident, mountains and rocks</a>
<a id='line_825'>    More free from motion-no, not Death himself</a>
<a id='line_826'>    In mortal fury half so peremptory</a>

<a id='line_831'>    That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas;</a>
<a id='line_832'>    Talks as familiarly of roaring lions</a>
<a id='line_833'>    As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!</a>
<a id='line_834'>    What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?</a>
<a id='line_835'>    He speaks plain cannon-fire, and smoke and bounce;</a>

<a id='line_888'>    Or if you will, to speak more properly,</a>
<a id='line_889'>    I will enforce it eas'ly to my love.</a>
<a id='line_890'>    Further I will not flatter you, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_891'>    That all I see in you is worthy love,</a>
<a id='line_892'>    Than this: that nothing do I see in you-</a>
<a id='line_893'>    Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge-</a>
<a id='line_894'>    That I can find should merit any hate.</a>
<a id='line_895'>  KING JOHN. What say these young ones? What say you, my niece?</a>
<a id='line_896'>  BLANCH. That she is bound in honour still to do</a>
<a id='line_897'>    What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.</a>
<a id='line_898'>  KING JOHN. Speak then, Prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?</a>
<a id='line_899'>  LEWIS. Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;</a>
<a id='line_900'>    For I do love her most unfeignedly.</a>
<a id='line_901'>  KING JOHN. Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,</a>
<a id='line_902'>    Poictiers, and Anjou, these five provinces,</a>
<a id='line_903'>    With her to thee; and this addition more,</a>
<a id='line_904'>    Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.</a>
<a id='line_905'>    Philip of France, if thou be pleas'd withal,</a>
<a id='line_906'>    Command thy son and daughter to join hands.</a>
<a id='line_907'>  KING PHILIP. It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.</a>
<a id='line_908'>  AUSTRIA. And your lips too; for I am well assur'd</a>
<a id='line_909'>    That I did so when I was first assur'd.</a>
<a id='line_910'>  KING PHILIP. Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,</a>
<a id='line_911'>    Let in that amity which you have made;</a>
<a id='line_912'>    For at Saint Mary's chapel presently</a>
<a id='line_913'>    The rites of marriage shall be solemniz'd.</a>
<a id='line_914'>    Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?</a>
<a id='line_915'>    I know she is not; for this match made up</a>
<a id='line_916'>    Her presence would have interrupted much.</a>
<a id='line_917'>    Where is she and her son? Tell me, who knows.</a>
<a id='line_918'>  LEWIS. She is sad and passionate at your Highness' tent.</a>
<a id='line_919'>  KING PHILIP. And, by my faith, this league that we have made</a>
<a id='line_920'>    Will give her sadness very little cure.</a>
<a id='line_921'>    Brother of England, how may we content</a>
<a id='line_922'>    This widow lady? In her right we came;</a>
<a id='line_923'>    Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way,</a>
<a id='line_924'>    To our own vantage.</a>
<a id='line_925'>  KING JOHN. We will heal up all,</a>
<a id='line_926'>    For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Britaine,</a>

<a id='line_928'>    We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;</a>
<a id='line_929'>    Some speedy messenger bid her repair</a>
<a id='line_930'>    To our solemnity. I trust we shall,</a>
<a id='line_931'>    If not fill up the measure of her will,</a>
<a id='line_932'>    Yet in some measure satisfy her so</a>
<a id='line_933'>    That we shall stop her exclamation.</a>
<a id='line_934'>    Go we as well as haste will suffer us</a>

<a id='line_1140'>    Thou canst not, Cardinal, devise a name</a>

<a id='line_1590'>  LEWIS. All days of glory, joy, and happiness.</a>
<a id='line_1591'>  PANDULPH. If you had won it, certainly you had.</a>
<a id='line_1592'>    No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,</a>

<a id='line_1751'>  HUBERT. Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.</a>
<a id='line_1752'>  ARTHUR. Alas, what need you be so boist'rous rough?</a>
<a id='line_1753'>    I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.</a>
<a id='line_1754'>    For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!</a>
<a id='line_1755'>    Nay, hear me, Hubert! Drive these men away,</a>
<a id='line_1756'>    And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;</a>
<a id='line_1757'>    I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,</a>
<a id='line_1758'>    Nor look upon the iron angrily;</a>
<a id='line_1759'>    Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,</a>
<a id='line_1760'>    Whatever torment you do put me to.</a>
<a id='line_1761'>  HUBERT. Go, stand within; let me alone with him.</a>
<a id='line_1762'>  EXECUTIONER. I am best pleas'd to be from such a deed.</a>
<a id='line_1763'>                                                  Exeunt EXECUTIONERS</a>
<a id='line_1764'>  ARTHUR. Alas, I then have chid away my friend!</a>
<a id='line_1765'>    He hath a stern look but a gentle heart.</a>
<a id='line_1766'>    Let him come back, that his compassion may</a>
<a id='line_1767'>    Give life to yours.</a>
<a id='line_1768'>  HUBERT. Come, boy, prepare yourself.</a>
<a id='line_1769'>  ARTHUR. Is there no remedy?</a>
<a id='line_1770'>  HUBERT. None, but to lose your eyes.</a>
<a id='line_1771'>  ARTHUR. O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,</a>
<a id='line_1772'>    A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,</a>
<a id='line_1773'>    Any annoyance in that precious sense!</a>
<a id='line_1774'>    Then, feeling what small things are boisterous there,</a>
<a id='line_1775'>    Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.</a>
<a id='line_1776'>  HUBERT. Is this your promise? Go to, hold your tongue.</a>
<a id='line_1777'>  ARTHUR. Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues</a>
<a id='line_1778'>    Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes.</a>
<a id='line_1779'>    Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;</a>
<a id='line_1780'>    Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,</a>
<a id='line_1781'>    So I may keep mine eyes. O, spare mine eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1782'>    Though to no use but still to look on you!</a>
<a id='line_1783'>    Lo, by my troth, the instrument is cold</a>
<a id='line_1784'>    And would not harm me.</a>
<a id='line_1785'>  HUBERT. I can heat it, boy.</a>
<a id='line_1786'>  ARTHUR. No, in good sooth; the fire is dead with grief,</a>
<a id='line_1787'>    Being create for comfort, to be us'd</a>
<a id='line_1788'>    In undeserved extremes. See else yourself:</a>
<a id='line_1789'>    There is no malice in this burning coal;</a>
<a id='line_1790'>    The breath of heaven hath blown his spirit out,</a>
<a id='line_1791'>    And strew'd repentant ashes on his head.</a>
<a id='line_1792'>  HUBERT. But with my breath I can revive it, boy.</a>
<a id='line_1793'>  ARTHUR. An if you do, you will but make it blush</a>
<a id='line_1794'>    And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert.</a>
<a id='line_1795'>    Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1796'>    And, like a dog that is compell'd to fight,</a>
<a id='line_1797'>    Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.</a>
<a id='line_1798'>    All things that you should use to do me wrong</a>
<a id='line_1799'>    Deny their office; only you do lack</a>
<a id='line_1800'>    That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,</a>
<a id='line_1801'>    Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.</a>
<a id='line_1802'>  HUBERT. Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye</a>
<a id='line_1803'>    For all the treasure that thine uncle owes.</a>
<a id='line_1804'>    Yet I am sworn, and I did purpose, boy,</a>
<a id='line_1805'>    With this same very iron to burn them out.</a>
<a id='line_1806'>  ARTHUR. O, now you look like Hubert! All this while</a>
<a id='line_1807'>    You were disguis'd.</a>
<a id='line_1808'>  HUBERT. Peace; no more. Adieu.</a>
<a id='line_1809'>    Your uncle must not know but you are dead:</a>
<a id='line_1810'>    I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports;</a>

<a id='line_1814'>  ARTHUR. O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.</a>
<a id='line_1815'>  HUBERT. Silence; no more. Go closely in with me.</a>
<a id='line_1816'>    Much danger do I undergo for thee.                         Exeunt</a>

<a id='line_1818'>SCENE 2.</a>
<a id='line_1819'></a>
<a id='line_1820'>England. KING JOHN'S palace</a>
<a id='line_1821'></a>
<a id='line_1822'>Enter KING JOHN, PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and other LORDS</a>
<a id='line_1823'></a>
<a id='line_1824'>  KING JOHN. Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_1825'>    And look'd upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.</a>
<a id='line_1826'>  PEMBROKE. This once again, but that your Highness pleas'd,</a>
<a id='line_1827'>    Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,</a>
<a id='line_1828'>    And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,</a>
<a id='line_1829'>    The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;</a>
<a id='line_1830'>    Fresh expectation troubled not the land</a>
<a id='line_1831'>    With any long'd-for change or better state.</a>
<a id='line_1832'>  SALISBURY. Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,</a>
<a id='line_1833'>    To guard a title that was rich before,</a>
<a id='line_1834'>    To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,</a>
<a id='line_1835'>    To throw a perfume on the violet,</a>
<a id='line_1836'>    To smooth the ice, or add another hue</a>
<a id='line_1837'>    Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light</a>
<a id='line_1838'>    To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,</a>
<a id='line_1839'>    Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.</a>
<a id='line_1840'>  PEMBROKE. But that your royal pleasure must be done,</a>
<a id='line_1841'>    This act is as an ancient tale new told</a>
<a id='line_1842'>    And, in the last repeating, troublesome,</a>
<a id='line_1843'>    Being urged at a time unseasonable.</a>
<a id='line_1844'>  SALISBURY. In this the antique and well-noted face</a>
<a id='line_1845'>    Of plain old form is much disfigured;</a>
<a id='line_1846'>    And like a shifted wind unto a sail</a>
<a id='line_1847'>    It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,</a>
<a id='line_1848'>    Startles and frights consideration,</a>
<a id='line_1849'>    Makes sound opinion sick, and truth suspected,</a>
<a id='line_1850'>    For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.</a>
<a id='line_1851'>  PEMBROKE. When workmen strive to do better than well,</a>
<a id='line_1852'>    They do confound their skill in covetousness;</a>
<a id='line_1853'>    And oftentimes excusing of a fault</a>
<a id='line_1854'>    Doth make the fault the worse by th' excuse,</a>
<a id='line_1855'>    As patches set upon a little breach</a>
<a id='line_1856'>    Discredit more in hiding of the fault</a>
<a id='line_1857'>    Than did the fault before it was so patch'd.</a>
<a id='line_1858'>  SALISBURY. To this effect, before you were new-crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_1859'>    We breath'd our counsel; but it pleas'd your Highness</a>
<a id='line_1860'>    To overbear it; and we are all well pleas'd,</a>
<a id='line_1861'>    Since all and every part of what we would</a>
<a id='line_1862'>    Doth make a stand at what your Highness will.</a>
<a id='line_1863'>  KING JOHN. Some reasons of this double coronation</a>
<a id='line_1864'>    I have possess'd you with, and think them strong;</a>
<a id='line_1865'>    And more, more strong, when lesser is my fear,</a>
<a id='line_1866'>    I shall indue you with. Meantime but ask</a>
<a id='line_1867'>    What you would have reform'd that is not well,</a>
<a id='line_1868'>    And well shall you perceive how willingly</a>
<a id='line_1869'>    I will both hear and grant you your requests.</a>
<a id='line_1870'>  PEMBROKE. Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,</a>
<a id='line_1871'>    To sound the purposes of all their hearts,</a>
<a id='line_1872'>    Both for myself and them- but, chief of all,</a>
<a id='line_1873'>    Your safety, for the which myself and them</a>
<a id='line_1874'>    Bend their best studies, heartily request</a>
<a id='line_1875'>    Th' enfranchisement of Arthur, whose restraint</a>
<a id='line_1876'>    Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent</a>
<a id='line_1877'>    To break into this dangerous argument:</a>
<a id='line_1878'>    If what in rest you have in right you hold,</a>
<a id='line_1879'>    Why then your fears-which, as they say, attend</a>
<a id='line_1880'>    The steps of wrong-should move you to mew up</a>
<a id='line_1881'>    Your tender kinsman, and to choke his days</a>
<a id='line_1882'>    With barbarous ignorance, and deny his youth</a>
<a id='line_1883'>    The rich advantage of good exercise?</a>
<a id='line_1884'>    That the time's enemies may not have this</a>
<a id='line_1885'>    To grace occasions, let it be our suit</a>
<a id='line_1886'>    That you have bid us ask his liberty;</a>
<a id='line_1887'>    Which for our goods we do no further ask</a>
<a id='line_1888'>    Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,</a>
<a id='line_1889'>    Counts it your weal he have his liberty.</a>
<a id='line_1890'>  KING JOHN. Let it be so. I do commit his youth</a>
<a id='line_1891'>    To your direction.</a>
<a id='line_1892'></a>
<a id='line_1893'>                     Enter HUBERT</a>
<a id='line_1894'></a>
<a id='line_1895'>    [Aside]  Hubert, what news with you?</a>
<a id='line_1896'>  PEMBROKE. This is the man should do the bloody deed:</a>
<a id='line_1897'>    He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine;</a>
<a id='line_1898'>    The image of a wicked heinous fault</a>
<a id='line_1899'>    Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his</a>
<a id='line_1900'>    Doth show the mood of a much troubled breast,</a>
<a id='line_1901'>    And I do fearfully believe 'tis done</a>
<a id='line_1902'>    What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.</a>
<a id='line_1903'>  SALISBURY. The colour of the King doth come and go</a>
<a id='line_1904'>    Between his purpose and his conscience,</a>
<a id='line_1905'>    Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set.</a>
<a id='line_1906'>    His passion is so ripe it needs must break.</a>
<a id='line_1907'>  PEMBROKE. And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence</a>
<a id='line_1908'>    The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.</a>
<a id='line_1909'>  KING JOHN. We cannot hold mortality's strong hand.</a>
<a id='line_1910'>    Good lords, although my will to give is living,</a>
<a id='line_1911'>    The suit which you demand is gone and dead:</a>
<a id='line_1912'>    He tells us Arthur is deceas'd to-night.</a>
<a id='line_1913'>  SALISBURY. Indeed, we fear'd his sickness was past cure.</a>
<a id='line_1914'>  PEMBROKE. Indeed, we heard how near his death he was,</a>
<a id='line_1915'>    Before the child himself felt he was sick.</a>
<a id='line_1916'>    This must be answer'd either here or hence.</a>
<a id='line_1917'>  KING JOHN. Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?</a>
<a id='line_1918'>    Think you I bear the shears of destiny?</a>
<a id='line_1919'>    Have I commandment on the pulse of life?</a>
<a id='line_1920'>  SALISBURY. It is apparent foul-play; and 'tis shame</a>
<a id='line_1921'>    That greatness should so grossly offer it.</a>
<a id='line_1922'>    So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.</a>
<a id='line_1923'>  PEMBROKE. Stay yet, Lord Salisbury, I'll go with thee</a>
<a id='line_1924'>    And find th' inheritance of this poor child,</a>
<a id='line_1925'>    His little kingdom of a forced grave.</a>
<a id='line_1926'>    That blood which ow'd the breadth of all this isle</a>
<a id='line_1927'>    Three foot of it doth hold-bad world the while!</a>
<a id='line_1928'>    This must not be thus borne: this will break out</a>
<a id='line_1929'>    To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.            Exeunt LORDS</a>
<a id='line_1930'>  KING JOHN. They burn in indignation. I repent.</a>
<a id='line_1931'>    There is no sure foundation set on blood,</a>
<a id='line_1932'>    No certain life achiev'd by others' death.</a>
<a id='line_1933'></a>
<a id='line_1934'>                 Enter a MESSENGER</a>
<a id='line_1935'></a>
<a id='line_1936'>    A fearful eye thou hast; where is that blood</a>
<a id='line_1937'>    That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?</a>
<a id='line_1938'>    So foul a sky clears not without a storm.</a>
<a id='line_1939'>    Pour down thy weather-how goes all in France?</a>
<a id='line_1940'>  MESSENGER. From France to England. Never such a pow'r</a>
<a id='line_1941'>    For any foreign preparation</a>
<a id='line_1942'>    Was levied in the body of a land.</a>
<a id='line_1943'>    The copy of your speed is learn'd by them,</a>

<a id='line_1945'>    The tidings comes that they are all arriv'd.</a>
<a id='line_1946'>  KING JOHN. O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?</a>
<a id='line_1947'>    Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,</a>
<a id='line_1948'>    That such an army could be drawn in France,</a>
<a id='line_1949'>    And she not hear of it?</a>
<a id='line_1950'>  MESSENGER. My liege, her ear</a>
<a id='line_1951'>    Is stopp'd with dust: the first of April died</a>
<a id='line_1952'>    Your noble mother; and as I hear, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_1953'>    The Lady Constance in a frenzy died</a>
<a id='line_1954'>    Three days before; but this from rumour's tongue</a>
<a id='line_1955'>    I idly heard-if true or false I know not.</a>
<a id='line_1956'>  KING JOHN. Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!</a>
<a id='line_1957'>    O, make a league with me, till I have pleas'd</a>
<a id='line_1958'>    My discontented peers! What! mother dead!</a>
<a id='line_1959'>    How wildly then walks my estate in France!</a>
<a id='line_1960'>    Under whose conduct came those pow'rs of France</a>
<a id='line_1961'>    That thou for truth giv'st out are landed here?</a>
<a id='line_1962'>  MESSENGER. Under the Dauphin.</a>
<a id='line_1963'>  KING JOHN. Thou hast made me giddy</a>
<a id='line_1964'>    With these in tidings.</a>

<a id='line_1983'>    And here's a prophet that I brought with me</a>
<a id='line_1984'>    From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found</a>

<a id='line_2036'>    And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,</a>
<a id='line_2037'>    Whilst he that hears makes fearful action</a>
<a id='line_2038'>    With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.</a>
<a id='line_2039'>    I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,</a>
<a id='line_2040'>    The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,</a>
<a id='line_2041'>    With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;</a>
<a id='line_2042'>    Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,</a>
<a id='line_2043'>    Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste</a>
<a id='line_2044'>    Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,</a>
<a id='line_2045'>    Told of a many thousand warlike French</a>
<a id='line_2046'>    That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent.</a>
<a id='line_2047'>    Another lean unwash'd artificer</a>
<a id='line_2048'>    Cuts off his tale, and talks of Arthur's death.</a>
<a id='line_2049'>  KING JOHN. Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?</a>
<a id='line_2050'>    Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?</a>
<a id='line_2051'>    Thy hand hath murd'red him. I had a mighty cause</a>
<a id='line_2052'>    To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.</a>
<a id='line_2053'>  HUBERT. No had, my lord! Why, did you not provoke me?</a>
<a id='line_2054'>  KING JOHN. It is the curse of kings to be attended</a>
<a id='line_2055'>    By slaves that take their humours for a warrant</a>
<a id='line_2056'>    To break within the bloody house of life,</a>
<a id='line_2057'>    And on the winking of authority</a>
<a id='line_2058'>    To understand a law; to know the meaning</a>
<a id='line_2059'>    Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns</a>
<a id='line_2060'>    More upon humour than advis'd respect.</a>
<a id='line_2061'>  HUBERT. Here is your hand and seal for what I did.</a>
<a id='line_2062'>  KING JOHN. O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth</a>
<a id='line_2063'>    Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal</a>
<a id='line_2064'>    Witness against us to damnation!</a>
<a id='line_2065'>    How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds</a>
<a id='line_2066'>    Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,</a>
<a id='line_2067'>    A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,</a>
<a id='line_2068'>    Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,</a>
<a id='line_2069'>    This murder had not come into my mind;</a>
<a id='line_2070'>    But, taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,</a>
<a id='line_2071'>    Finding thee fit for bloody villainy,</a>
<a id='line_2072'>    Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,</a>
<a id='line_2073'>    I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;</a>
<a id='line_2074'>    And thou, to be endeared to a king,</a>
<a id='line_2075'>    Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.</a>
<a id='line_2076'>  HUBERT. My lord-</a>
<a id='line_2077'>  KING JOHN. Hadst thou but shook thy head or made pause,</a>
<a id='line_2078'>    When I spake darkly what I purposed,</a>
<a id='line_2079'>    Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,</a>
<a id='line_2080'>    As bid me tell my tale in express words,</a>
<a id='line_2081'>    Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,</a>
<a id='line_2082'>    And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me.</a>
<a id='line_2083'>    But thou didst understand me by my signs,</a>
<a id='line_2084'>    And didst in signs again parley with sin;</a>
<a id='line_2085'>    Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,</a>
<a id='line_2086'>    And consequently thy rude hand to act</a>
<a id='line_2087'>    The deed which both our tongues held vile to name.</a>
<a id='line_2088'>    Out of my sight, and never see me more!</a>
<a id='line_2089'>    My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,</a>
<a id='line_2090'>    Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign pow'rs;</a>
<a id='line_2091'>    Nay, in the body of the fleshly land,</a>
<a id='line_2092'>    This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,</a>
<a id='line_2093'>    Hostility and civil tumult reigns</a>
<a id='line_2094'>    Between my conscience and my cousin's death.</a>
<a id='line_2095'>  HUBERT. Arm you against your other enemies,</a>
<a id='line_2096'>    I'll make a peace between your soul and you.</a>
<a id='line_2097'>    Young Arthur is alive. This hand of mine</a>
<a id='line_2098'>    Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,</a>
<a id='line_2099'>    Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.</a>
<a id='line_2100'>    Within this bosom never ent'red yet</a>
<a id='line_2101'>    The dreadful motion of a murderous thought</a>
<a id='line_2102'>    And you have slander'd nature in my form,</a>
<a id='line_2103'>    Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,</a>
<a id='line_2104'>    Is yet the cover of a fairer mind</a>
<a id='line_2105'>    Than to be butcher of an innocent child.</a>
<a id='line_2106'>  KING JOHN. Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,</a>
<a id='line_2107'>    Throw this report on their incensed rage</a>
<a id='line_2108'>    And make them tame to their obedience!</a>
<a id='line_2109'>    Forgive the comment that my passion made</a>
<a id='line_2110'>    Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,</a>
<a id='line_2111'>    And foul imaginary eyes of blood</a>
<a id='line_2112'>    Presented thee more hideous than thou art.</a>
<a id='line_2113'>    O, answer not; but to my closet bring</a>

<a id='line_2620'>  SALISBURY. I did not think the King so stor'd with friends.</a>
<a id='line_2621'>  PEMBROKE. Up once again; put spirit in the French;</a>
<a id='line_2622'>    If they miscarry, we miscarry too.</a>

<a id='line_2624'>    In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.</a>
<a id='line_2625'>  PEMBROKE. They say King John, sore sick, hath left the field.</a>

<a id='line_2628'></a>
<a id='line_2629'>  MELUN. Lead me to the revolts of England here.</a>
<a id='line_2630'>  SALISBURY. When we were happy we had other names.</a>
<a id='line_2631'>  PEMBROKE. It is the Count Melun.</a>
<a id='line_2632'>  SALISBURY. Wounded to death.</a>
<a id='line_2633'>  MELUN. Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;</a>
<a id='line_2634'>    Unthread the rude eye of rebellion,</a>

<a id='line_2636'>    Seek out King John, and fall before his feet;</a>
<a id='line_2637'>    For if the French be lords of this loud day,</a>
<a id='line_2638'>    He means to recompense the pains you take</a>

<a id='line_2641'>    Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;</a>
<a id='line_2642'>    Even on that altar where we swore to you</a>
<a id='line_2643'>    Dear amity and everlasting love.</a>
<a id='line_2644'>  SALISBURY. May this be possible? May this be true?</a>
<a id='line_2645'>  MELUN. Have I not hideous death within my view,</a>
<a id='line_2646'>    Retaining but a quantity of life,</a>
<a id='line_2647'>    Which bleeds away even as a form of wax</a>
<a id='line_2648'>    Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?</a>
<a id='line_2649'>    What in the world should make me now deceive,</a>
<a id='line_2650'>    Since I must lose the use of all deceit?</a>

<a id='line_2674'>    Of this most fair occasion, by the which</a>
<a id='line_2675'>    We will untread the steps of damned flight,</a>

<a id='line_2677'>    Leaving our rankness and irregular course,</a>
<a id='line_2678'>    Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd,</a>

<a id='line_2727'>  BASTARD. A friend. What art thou?</a>
<a id='line_2728'>  HUBERT. Of the part of England.</a>
<a id='line_2729'>  BASTARD. Whither dost thou go?</a>
<a id='line_2730'>  HUBERT. What's that to thee? Why may I not demand</a>
<a id='line_2731'>    Of thine affairs as well as thou of mine?</a>
<a id='line_2732'>  BASTARD. Hubert, I think.</a>
<a id='line_2733'>  HUBERT. Thou hast a perfect thought.</a>

<a id='line_2737'>  BASTARD. Who thou wilt. And if thou please,</a>
<a id='line_2738'>    Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think</a>

<a id='line_2746'>    To find you out.</a>
<a id='line_2747'>  BASTARD. Brief, then; and what's the news?</a>
<a id='line_2748'>  HUBERT. O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,</a>
<a id='line_2749'>    Black, fearful, comfortless, and horrible.</a>
<a id='line_2750'>  BASTARD. Show me the very wound of this ill news;</a>
<a id='line_2751'>    I am no woman, I'll not swoon at it.</a>
<a id='line_2752'>  HUBERT. The King, I fear, is poison'd by a monk;</a>

<a id='line_2756'>    Than if you had at leisure known of this.</a>
<a id='line_2757'>  BASTARD. How did he take it; who did taste to him?</a>
<a id='line_2758'>  HUBERT. A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,</a>
<a id='line_2759'>    Whose bowels suddenly burst out. The King</a>
<a id='line_2760'>    Yet speaks, and peradventure may recover.</a>
<a id='line_2761'>  BASTARD. Who didst thou leave to tend his Majesty?</a>
<a id='line_2762'>  HUBERT. Why, know you not? The lords are all come back,</a>

<a id='line_2780'></a>
<a id='line_2781'>  PRINCE HENRY. It is too late; the life of all his blood</a>
<a id='line_2782'>    Is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain.</a>
<a id='line_2783'>    Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,</a>

<a id='line_2788'></a>
<a id='line_2789'>  PEMBROKE. His Highness yet doth speak, and holds belief</a>
<a id='line_2790'>    That, being brought into the open air,</a>
<a id='line_2791'>    It would allay the burning quality</a>
<a id='line_2792'>    Of that fell poison which assaileth him.</a>

<a id='line_2802'>    With many legions of strange fantasies,</a>
<a id='line_2803'>    Which, in their throng and press to that last hold,</a>
<a id='line_2804'>    Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death should sing.</a>

<a id='line_2823'>  PRINCE HENRY. How fares your Majesty?</a>

<a id='line_2835'>  KING JOHN. The salt in them is hot.</a>
<a id='line_2836'>    Within me is a hell; and there the poison</a>
