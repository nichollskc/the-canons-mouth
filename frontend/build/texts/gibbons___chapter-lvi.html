<a id='line_9'></a>
<a id='line_10'>      The three great nations of the world, the Greeks, the Saracens,</a>
<a id='line_11'>      and the Franks, encountered each other on the theatre of Italy. 1</a>
<a id='line_12'>      The southern provinces, which now compose the kingdom of Naples,</a>
<a id='line_13'>      were subject, for the most part, to the Lombard dukes and princes</a>
<a id='line_14'>      of Beneventum; 2 so powerful in war, that they checked for a</a>
<a id='line_15'>      moment the genius of Charlemagne; so liberal in peace, that they</a>
<a id='line_16'>      maintained in their capital an academy of thirty-two philosophers</a>
<a id='line_17'>      and grammarians. The division of this flourishing state produced</a>
<a id='line_18'>      the rival principalities of Benevento, Salerno, and Capua; and</a>
<a id='line_19'>      the thoughtless ambition or revenge of the competitors invited</a>
<a id='line_20'>      the Saracens to the ruin of their common inheritance. During a</a>
<a id='line_21'>      calamitous period of two hundred years, Italy was exposed to a</a>
<a id='line_22'>      repetition of wounds, which the invaders were not capable of</a>
<a id='line_23'>      healing by the union and tranquility of a perfect conquest. Their</a>
<a id='line_24'>      frequent and almost annual squadrons issued from the port of</a>
<a id='line_25'>      Palermo, and were entertained with too much indulgence by the</a>
<a id='line_26'>      Christians of Naples: the more formidable fleets were prepared on</a>
<a id='line_27'>      the African coast; and even the Arabs of Andalusia were sometimes</a>
<a id='line_28'>      tempted to assist or oppose the Moslems of an adverse sect. In</a>
<a id='line_29'>      the revolution of human events, a new ambuscade was concealed in</a>
<a id='line_30'>      the Caudine Forks, the fields of Cannae were bedewed a second</a>
<a id='line_31'>      time with the blood of the Africans, and the sovereign of Rome</a>
<a id='line_32'>      again attacked or defended the walls of Capua and Tarentum. A</a>
<a id='line_33'>      colony of Saracens had been planted at Bari, which commands the</a>
<a id='line_34'>      entrance of the Adriatic Gulf; and their impartial depredations</a>
<a id='line_35'>      provoked the resentment, and conciliated the union of the two</a>
<a id='line_36'>      emperors. An offensive alliance was concluded between Basil the</a>
<a id='line_37'>      Macedonian, the first of his race, and Lewis the great-grandson</a>
<a id='line_38'>      of Charlemagne; 3 and each party supplied the deficiencies of his</a>
<a id='line_39'>      associate. It would have been imprudent in the Byzantine monarch</a>
<a id='line_40'>      to transport his stationary troops of Asia to an Italian</a>
<a id='line_41'>      campaign; and the Latin arms would have been insufficient if his</a>
<a id='line_42'>      superior navy had not occupied the mouth of the Gulf. The</a>
<a id='line_43'>      fortress of Bari was invested by the infantry of the Franks, and</a>
<a id='line_44'>      by the cavalry and galleys of the Greeks; and, after a defence of</a>
<a id='line_45'>      four years, the Arabian emir submitted to the clemency of Lewis,</a>
<a id='line_46'>      who commanded in person the operations of the siege. This</a>
<a id='line_47'>      important conquest had been achieved by the concord of the East</a>
<a id='line_48'>      and West; but their recent amity was soon imbittered by the</a>
<a id='line_49'>      mutual complaints of jealousy and pride. The Greeks assumed as</a>
<a id='line_50'>      their own the merit of the conquest and the pomp of the triumph;</a>
<a id='line_51'>      extolled the greatness of their powers, and affected to deride</a>
<a id='line_52'>      the intemperance and sloth of the handful of Barbarians who</a>
<a id='line_53'>      appeared under the banners of the Carlovingian prince. His reply</a>
<a id='line_54'>      is expressed with the eloquence of indignation and truth: “We</a>
<a id='line_55'>      confess the magnitude of your preparation,” says the</a>
<a id='line_56'>      great-grandson of Charlemagne. “Your armies were indeed as</a>
<a id='line_57'>      numerous as a cloud of summer locusts, who darken the day, flap</a>
<a id='line_58'>      their wings, and, after a short flight, tumble weary and</a>
<a id='line_59'>      breathless to the ground. Like them, ye sunk after a feeble</a>
<a id='line_60'>      effort; ye were vanquished by your own cowardice; and withdrew</a>
<a id='line_61'>      from the scene of action to injure and despoil our Christian</a>
<a id='line_62'>      subjects of the Sclavonian coast. We were few in number, and why</a>
<a id='line_63'>      were we few? Because, after a tedious expectation of your</a>
<a id='line_64'>      arrival, I had dismissed my host, and retained only a chosen band</a>
<a id='line_65'>      of warriors to continue the blockade of the city. If they</a>
<a id='line_66'>      indulged their hospitable feasts in the face of danger and death,</a>
<a id='line_67'>      did these feasts abate the vigor of their enterprise? Is it by</a>
<a id='line_68'>      your fasting that the walls of Bari have been overturned? Did not</a>
<a id='line_69'>      these valiant Franks, diminished as they were by languor and</a>
<a id='line_70'>      fatigue, intercept and vanish the three most powerful emirs of</a>
<a id='line_71'>      the Saracens? and did not their defeat precipitate the fall of</a>
<a id='line_72'>      the city? Bari is now fallen; Tarentum trembles; Calabria will be</a>
<a id='line_73'>      delivered; and, if we command the sea, the Island of Sicily may</a>
<a id='line_74'>      be rescued from the hands of the infidels. My brother,”</a>
<a id='line_75'>      accelerate (a name most offensive to the vanity of the Greek,)</a>
<a id='line_76'>      “accelerate your naval succors, respect your allies, and distrust</a>

<a id='line_106'>      by Baronius, (Annal. Eccles. A.D. 871, No. 51-71,) from the</a>
<a id='line_107'>      Vatican Ms. of Erchempert, or rather of the anonymous historian</a>
<a id='line_108'>      of Salerno.] These lofty hopes were soon extinguished by the</a>
<a id='line_109'>      death of Lewis, and the decay of the Carlovingian house; and</a>
<a id='line_110'>      whoever might deserve the honor, the Greek emperors, Basil, and</a>
<a id='line_111'>      his son Leo, secured the advantage, of the reduction of Bari. The</a>
<a id='line_112'>      Italians of Apulia and Calabria were persuaded or compelled to</a>
<a id='line_113'>      acknowledge their supremacy, and an ideal line from Mount</a>
<a id='line_114'>      Garganus to the Bay of Salerno, leaves the far greater part of</a>
<a id='line_115'>      the kingdom of Naples under the dominion of the Eastern empire.</a>
<a id='line_116'>      Beyond that line, the dukes or republics of Amalfi 5 and Naples,</a>
<a id='line_117'>      who had never forfeited their voluntary allegiance, rejoiced in</a>
<a id='line_118'>      the neighborhood of their lawful sovereign; and Amalfi was</a>
<a id='line_119'>      enriched by supplying Europe with the produce and manufactures of</a>
<a id='line_120'>      Asia. But the Lombard princes of Benevento, Salerno, and Capua, 6</a>
<a id='line_121'>      were reluctantly torn from the communion of the Latin world, and</a>
<a id='line_122'>      too often violated their oaths of servitude and tribute. The city</a>
<a id='line_123'>      of Bari rose to dignity and wealth, as the metropolis of the new</a>
<a id='line_124'>      theme or province of Lombardy: the title of patrician, and</a>
<a id='line_125'>      afterwards the singular name of Catapan, 7 was assigned to the</a>
<a id='line_126'>      supreme governor; and the policy both of the church and state was</a>
<a id='line_127'>      modelled in exact subordination to the throne of Constantinople.</a>
<a id='line_128'>      As long as the sceptre was disputed by the princes of Italy,</a>
<a id='line_129'>      their efforts were feeble and adverse; and the Greeks resisted or</a>
<a id='line_130'>      eluded the forces of Germany, which descended from the Alps under</a>
<a id='line_131'>      the Imperial standard of the Othos. The first and greatest of</a>
<a id='line_132'>      those Saxon princes was compelled to relinquish the siege of</a>
<a id='line_133'>      Bari: the second, after the loss of his stoutest bishops and</a>
<a id='line_134'>      barons, escaped with honor from the bloody field of Crotona. On</a>
<a id='line_135'>      that day the scale of war was turned against the Franks by the</a>
<a id='line_136'>      valor of the Saracens. 8 These corsairs had indeed been driven by</a>
<a id='line_137'>      the Byzantine fleets from the fortresses and coasts of Italy; but</a>
<a id='line_138'>      a sense of interest was more prevalent than superstition or</a>
<a id='line_139'>      resentment, and the caliph of Egypt had transported forty</a>
<a id='line_140'>      thousand Moslems to the aid of his Christian ally. The successors</a>
<a id='line_141'>      of Basil amused themselves with the belief, that the conquest of</a>
<a id='line_142'>      Lombardy had been achieved, and was still preserved by the</a>
<a id='line_143'>      justice of their laws, the virtues of their ministers, and the</a>
<a id='line_144'>      gratitude of a people whom they had rescued from anarchy and</a>
<a id='line_145'>      oppression. A series of rebellions might dart a ray of truth into</a>
<a id='line_146'>      the palace of Constantinople; and the illusions of flattery were</a>
<a id='line_147'>      dispelled by the easy and rapid success of the Norman</a>

<a id='line_177'></a>
<a id='line_178'>      The revolution of human affairs had produced in Apulia and</a>
<a id='line_179'>      Calabria a melancholy contrast between the age of Pythagoras and</a>
<a id='line_180'>      the tenth century of the Christian aera. At the former period,</a>
<a id='line_181'>      the coast of Great Greece (as it was then styled) was planted</a>
<a id='line_182'>      with free and opulent cities: these cities were peopled with</a>
<a id='line_183'>      soldiers, artists, and philosophers; and the military strength of</a>
<a id='line_184'>      Tarentum; Sybaris, or Crotona, was not inferior to that of a</a>
<a id='line_185'>      powerful kingdom. At the second aera, these once flourishing</a>
<a id='line_186'>      provinces were clouded with ignorance impoverished by tyranny,</a>
<a id='line_187'>      and depopulated by Barbarian war; nor can we severely accuse the</a>
<a id='line_188'>      exaggeration of a contemporary, that a fair and ample district</a>
<a id='line_189'>      was reduced to the same desolation which had covered the earth</a>
<a id='line_190'>      after the general deluge. 9 Among the hostilities of the Arabs,</a>
<a id='line_191'>      the Franks, and the Greeks, in the southern Italy, I shall select</a>
<a id='line_192'>      two or three anecdotes expressive of their national manners. 1.</a>
<a id='line_193'>      It was the amusement of the Saracens to profane, as well as to</a>
<a id='line_194'>      pillage, the monasteries and churches. At the siege of Salerno, a</a>
<a id='line_195'>      Mussulman chief spread his couch on the communion-table, and on</a>
<a id='line_196'>      that altar sacrificed each night the virginity of a Christian</a>
<a id='line_197'>      nun. As he wrestled with a reluctant maid, a beam in the roof was</a>
<a id='line_198'>      accidentally or dexterously thrown down on his head; and the</a>
<a id='line_199'>      death of the lustful emir was imputed to the wrath of Christ,</a>
<a id='line_200'>      which was at length awakened to the defence of his faithful</a>
<a id='line_201'>      spouse. 10 2. The Saracens besieged the cities of Beneventum and</a>
<a id='line_202'>      Capua: after a vain appeal to the successors of Charlemagne, the</a>
<a id='line_203'>      Lombards implored the clemency and aid of the Greek emperor. 11 A</a>
<a id='line_204'>      fearless citizen dropped from the walls, passed the</a>
<a id='line_205'>      intrenchments, accomplished his commission, and fell into the</a>
<a id='line_206'>      hands of the Barbarians as he was returning with the welcome</a>
<a id='line_207'>      news. They commanded him to assist their enterprise, and deceive</a>
<a id='line_208'>      his countrymen, with the assurance that wealth and honors should</a>
<a id='line_209'>      be the reward of his falsehood, and that his sincerity would be</a>
<a id='line_210'>      punished with immediate death. He affected to yield, but as soon</a>
<a id='line_211'>      as he was conducted within hearing of the Christians on the</a>
<a id='line_212'>      rampart, “Friends and brethren,” he cried with a loud voice, “be</a>
<a id='line_213'>      bold and patient, maintain the city; your sovereign is informed</a>
<a id='line_214'>      of your distress, and your deliverers are at hand. I know my</a>
<a id='line_215'>      doom, and commit my wife and children to your gratitude.” The</a>
<a id='line_216'>      rage of the Arabs confirmed his evidence; and the self-devoted</a>
<a id='line_217'>      patriot was transpierced with a hundred spears. He deserves to</a>
<a id='line_218'>      live in the memory of the virtuous, but the repetition of the</a>
<a id='line_219'>      same story in ancient and modern times, may sprinkle some doubts</a>
<a id='line_220'>      on the reality of this generous deed. 12 3. The recital of a</a>
<a id='line_221'>      third incident may provoke a smile amidst the horrors of war.</a>
<a id='line_222'>      Theobald, marquis of Camerino and Spoleto, 13 supported the</a>
<a id='line_223'>      rebels of Beneventum; and his wanton cruelty was not incompatible</a>
<a id='line_224'>      in that age with the character of a hero. His captives of the</a>
<a id='line_225'>      Greek nation or party were castrated without mercy, and the</a>
<a id='line_226'>      outrage was aggravated by a cruel jest, that he wished to present</a>
<a id='line_227'>      the emperor with a supply of eunuchs, the most precious ornaments</a>
<a id='line_228'>      of the Byzantine court. The garrison of a castle had been</a>
<a id='line_229'>      defeated in a sally, and the prisoners were sentenced to the</a>
<a id='line_230'>      customary operation. But the sacrifice was disturbed by the</a>
<a id='line_231'>      intrusion of a frantic female, who, with bleeding cheeks</a>
<a id='line_232'>      dishevelled hair, and importunate clamors, compelled the marquis</a>
<a id='line_233'>      to listen to her complaint. “Is it thus,” she cried, “ye</a>
<a id='line_234'>      magnanimous heroes, that ye wage war against women, against women</a>
<a id='line_235'>      who have never injured ye, and whose only arms are the distaff</a>
<a id='line_236'>      and the loom?” Theobald denied the charge, and protested that,</a>
<a id='line_237'>      since the Amazons, he had never heard of a female war. “And how,”</a>
<a id='line_238'>      she furiously exclaimed, “can you attack us more directly, how</a>
<a id='line_239'>      can you wound us in a more vital part, than by robbing our</a>
<a id='line_240'>      husbands of what we most dearly cherish, the source of our joys,</a>
<a id='line_241'>      and the hope of our posterity? The plunder of our flocks and</a>
<a id='line_242'>      herds I have endured without a murmur, but this fatal injury,</a>
<a id='line_243'>      this irreparable loss, subdues my patience, and calls aloud on</a>
<a id='line_244'>      the justice of heaven and earth.” A general laugh applauded her</a>

<a id='line_334'>      the Greek habit, but who soon revealed himself as a rebel, a</a>
<a id='line_335'>      fugitive, and a mortal foe of the Greek empire. His name was</a>
<a id='line_336'>      Melo; a noble citizen of Bari, who, after an unsuccessful revolt,</a>
<a id='line_337'>      was compelled to seek new allies and avengers of his country. The</a>

<a id='line_339'>      his confidence: they listened to the complaints, and still more</a>
<a id='line_340'>      to the promises, of the patriot. The assurance of wealth</a>
<a id='line_341'>      demonstrated the justice of his cause; and they viewed, as the</a>
<a id='line_342'>      inheritance of the brave, the fruitful land which was oppressed</a>
<a id='line_343'>      by effeminate tyrants. On their return to Normandy, they kindled</a>
<a id='line_344'>      a spark of enterprise, and a small but intrepid band was freely</a>
<a id='line_345'>      associated for the deliverance of Apulia. They passed the Alps by</a>
<a id='line_346'>      separate roads, and in the disguise of pilgrims; but in the</a>
<a id='line_347'>      neighborhood of Rome they were saluted by the chief of Bari, who</a>
<a id='line_348'>      supplied the more indigent with arms and horses, and instantly</a>
<a id='line_349'>      led them to the field of action. In the first conflict, their</a>
<a id='line_350'>      valor prevailed; but in the second engagement they were</a>
<a id='line_351'>      overwhelmed by the numbers and military engines of the Greeks,</a>
<a id='line_352'>      and indignantly retreated with their faces to the enemy. 1811 The</a>
<a id='line_353'>      unfortunate Melo ended his life a suppliant at the court of</a>

<a id='line_355'>      their promised land, wandered among the hills and valleys of</a>
<a id='line_356'>      Italy, and earned their daily subsistence by the sword. To that</a>
<a id='line_357'>      formidable sword the princes of Capua, Beneventum, Salerno, and</a>
<a id='line_358'>      Naples, alternately appealed in their domestic quarrels; the</a>
<a id='line_359'>      superior spirit and discipline of the Normans gave victory to the</a>

<a id='line_361'>      balance of power, lest the preponderance of any rival state</a>
<a id='line_362'>      should render their aid less important, and their service less</a>
<a id='line_363'>      profitable. Their first asylum was a strong camp in the depth of</a>
<a id='line_364'>      the marshes of Campania: but they were soon endowed by the</a>
<a id='line_365'>      liberality of the duke of Naples with a more plentiful and</a>
<a id='line_366'>      permanent seat. Eight miles from his residence, as a bulwark</a>
<a id='line_367'>      against Capua, the town of Aversa was built and fortified for</a>
<a id='line_368'>      their use; and they enjoyed as their own the corn and fruits, the</a>
<a id='line_369'>      meadows and groves, of that fertile district. The report of their</a>
<a id='line_370'>      success attracted every year new swarms of pilgrims and soldiers:</a>
<a id='line_371'>      the poor were urged by necessity; the rich were excited by hope;</a>
<a id='line_372'>      and the brave and active spirits of Normandy were impatient of</a>
<a id='line_373'>      ease and ambitious of renown. The independent standard of Aversa</a>
<a id='line_374'>      afforded shelter and encouragement to the outlaws of the</a>

<a id='line_493'>      historian may divide the merit with the lance of the Normans. It</a>
<a id='line_494'>      is, however, true, that they essentially promoted the success of</a>
<a id='line_495'>      Maniaces, who reduced thirteen cities, and the greater part of</a>
<a id='line_496'>      Sicily, under the obedience of the emperor. But his military fame</a>
<a id='line_497'>      was sullied by ingratitude and tyranny. In the division of the</a>
<a id='line_498'>      spoils, the deserts of his brave auxiliaries were forgotten; and</a>
<a id='line_499'>      neither their avarice nor their pride could brook this injurious</a>
<a id='line_500'>      treatment. They complained by the mouth of their interpreter:</a>
<a id='line_501'>      their complaint was disregarded; their interpreter was scourged;</a>
<a id='line_502'>      the sufferings were his; the insult and resentment belonged to</a>
<a id='line_503'>      those whose sentiments he had delivered. Yet they dissembled till</a>
<a id='line_504'>      they had obtained, or stolen, a safe passage to the Italian</a>
<a id='line_505'>      continent: their brethren of Aversa sympathized in their</a>
<a id='line_506'>      indignation, and the province of Apulia was invaded as the</a>
<a id='line_507'>      forfeit of the debt. 22 Above twenty years after the first</a>
<a id='line_508'>      emigration, the Normans took the field with no more than seven</a>
<a id='line_509'>      hundred horse and five hundred foot; and after the recall of the</a>
<a id='line_510'>      Byzantine legions 23 from the Sicilian war, their numbers are</a>
<a id='line_511'>      magnified to the amount of threescore thousand men. Their herald</a>
<a id='line_512'>      proposed the option of battle or retreat; “of battle,” was the</a>
<a id='line_513'>      unanimous cry of the Normans; and one of their stoutest warriors,</a>
<a id='line_514'>      with a stroke of his fist, felled to the ground the horse of the</a>
<a id='line_515'>      Greek messenger. He was dismissed with a fresh horse; the insult</a>
<a id='line_516'>      was concealed from the Imperial troops; but in two successive</a>
<a id='line_517'>      battles they were more fatally instructed of the prowess of their</a>
<a id='line_518'>      adversaries. In the plains of Cannae, the Asiatics fled before</a>
<a id='line_519'>      the adventurers of France; the duke of Lombardy was made</a>
<a id='line_520'>      prisoner; the Apulians acquiesced in a new dominion; and the four</a>
<a id='line_521'>      places of Bari, Otranto, Brundusium, and Tarentum, were alone</a>
<a id='line_522'>      saved in the shipwreck of the Grecian fortunes. From this aera we</a>
<a id='line_523'>      may date the establishment of the Norman power, which soon</a>
<a id='line_524'>      eclipsed the infant colony of Aversa. Twelve counts 24 were</a>
<a id='line_525'>      chosen by the popular suffrage; and age, birth, and merit, were</a>
<a id='line_526'>      the motives of their choice. The tributes of their peculiar</a>
<a id='line_527'>      districts were appropriated to their use; and each count erected</a>
<a id='line_528'>      a fortress in the midst of his lands, and at the head of his</a>
<a id='line_529'>      vassals. In the centre of the province, the common habitation of</a>
<a id='line_530'>      Melphi was reserved as the metropolis and citadel of the</a>
<a id='line_531'>      republic; a house and separate quarter was allotted to each of</a>
<a id='line_532'>      the twelve counts: and the national concerns were regulated by</a>
<a id='line_533'>      this military senate. The first of his peers, their president and</a>
<a id='line_534'>      general, was entitled count of Apulia; and this dignity was</a>
<a id='line_535'>      conferred on William of the iron arm, who, in the language of the</a>
<a id='line_536'>      age, is styled a lion in battle, a lamb in society, and an angel</a>
<a id='line_537'>      in council. 25 The manners of his countrymen are fairly</a>
<a id='line_538'>      delineated by a contemporary and national historian. 26 “The</a>
<a id='line_539'>      Normans,” says Malaterra, “are a cunning and revengeful people;</a>
<a id='line_540'>      eloquence and dissimulation appear to be their hereditary</a>
<a id='line_541'>      qualities: they can stoop to flatter; but unless they are curbed</a>
<a id='line_542'>      by the restraint of law, they indulge the licentiousness of</a>
<a id='line_543'>      nature and passion. Their princes affect the praises of popular</a>
<a id='line_544'>      munificence; the people observe the medium, or rather blond the</a>
<a id='line_545'>      extremes, of avarice and prodigality; and in their eager thirst</a>
<a id='line_546'>      of wealth and dominion, they despise whatever they possess, and</a>
<a id='line_547'>      hope whatever they desire. Arms and horses, the luxury of dress,</a>
<a id='line_548'>      the exercises of hunting and hawking 27 are the delight of the</a>
<a id='line_549'>      Normans; but, on pressing occasions, they can endure with</a>

<a id='line_615'></a>
<a id='line_616'>      The Normans of Apulia were seated on the verge of the two</a>
<a id='line_617'>      empires; and, according to the policy of the hour, they accepted</a>
<a id='line_618'>      the investiture of their lands, from the sovereigns of Germany or</a>
<a id='line_619'>      Constantinople. But the firmest title of these adventurers was</a>
<a id='line_620'>      the right of conquest: they neither loved nor trusted; they were</a>
<a id='line_621'>      neither trusted nor beloved: the contempt of the princes was</a>
<a id='line_622'>      mixed with fear, and the fear of the natives was mingled with</a>
<a id='line_623'>      hatred and resentment. Every object of desire, a horse, a woman,</a>
<a id='line_624'>      a garden, tempted and gratified the rapaciousness of the</a>
<a id='line_625'>      strangers; 29 and the avarice of their chiefs was only colored by</a>
<a id='line_626'>      the more specious names of ambition and glory. The twelve counts</a>
<a id='line_627'>      were sometimes joined in the league of injustice: in their</a>
<a id='line_628'>      domestic quarrels they disputed the spoils of the people: the</a>
<a id='line_629'>      virtues of William were buried in his grave; and Drogo, his</a>
<a id='line_630'>      brother and successor, was better qualified to lead the valor,</a>
<a id='line_631'>      than to restrain the violence, of his peers. Under the reign of</a>
<a id='line_632'>      Constantine Monomachus, the policy, rather than benevolence, of</a>
<a id='line_633'>      the Byzantine court, attempted to relieve Italy from this</a>
<a id='line_634'>      adherent mischief, more grievous than a flight of Barbarians; 30</a>
<a id='line_635'>      and Argyrus, the son of Melo, was invested for this purpose with</a>
<a id='line_636'>      the most lofty titles 31 and the most ample commission. The</a>
<a id='line_637'>      memory of his father might recommend him to the Normans; and he</a>
<a id='line_638'>      had already engaged their voluntary service to quell the revolt</a>
<a id='line_639'>      of Maniaces, and to avenge their own and the public injury. It</a>
<a id='line_640'>      was the design of Constantine to transplant the warlike colony</a>
<a id='line_641'>      from the Italian provinces to the Persian war; and the son of</a>
<a id='line_642'>      Melo distributed among the chiefs the gold and manufactures of</a>
<a id='line_643'>      Greece, as the first-fruits of the Imperial bounty. But his arts</a>
<a id='line_644'>      were baffled by the sense and spirit of the conquerors of Apulia:</a>
<a id='line_645'>      his gifts, or at least his proposals, were rejected; and they</a>
<a id='line_646'>      unanimously refused to relinquish their possessions and their</a>
<a id='line_647'>      hopes for the distant prospect of Asiatic fortune. After the</a>
<a id='line_648'>      means of persuasion had failed, Argyrus resolved to compel or to</a>
<a id='line_649'>      destroy: the Latin powers were solicited against the common</a>
<a id='line_650'>      enemy; and an offensive alliance was formed of the pope and the</a>
<a id='line_651'>      two emperors of the East and West. The throne of St. Peter was</a>
<a id='line_652'>      occupied by Leo the Ninth, a simple saint, 32 of a temper most</a>
<a id='line_653'>      apt to deceive himself and the world, and whose venerable</a>
<a id='line_654'>      character would consecrate with the name of piety the measures</a>
<a id='line_655'>      least compatible with the practice of religion. His humanity was</a>
<a id='line_656'>      affected by the complaints, perhaps the calumnies, of an injured</a>
<a id='line_657'>      people: the impious Normans had interrupted the payment of</a>
<a id='line_658'>      tithes; and the temporal sword might be lawfully unsheathed</a>
<a id='line_659'>      against the sacrilegious robbers, who were deaf to the censures</a>
<a id='line_660'>      of the church. As a German of noble birth and royal kindred, Leo</a>
<a id='line_661'>      had free access to the court and confidence of the emperor Henry</a>
<a id='line_662'>      the Third; and in search of arms and allies, his ardent zeal</a>
<a id='line_663'>      transported him from Apulia to Saxony, from the Elbe to the</a>
<a id='line_664'>      Tyber. During these hostile preparations, Argyrus indulged</a>
<a id='line_665'>      himself in the use of secret and guilty weapons: a crowd of</a>
<a id='line_666'>      Normans became the victims of public or private revenge; and the</a>
<a id='line_667'>      valiant Drogo was murdered in a church. But his spirit survived</a>
<a id='line_668'>      in his brother Humphrey, the third count of Apulia. The assassins</a>
<a id='line_669'>      were chastised; and the son of Melo, overthrown and wounded, was</a>

<a id='line_743'>      by the popular superstition. In the calm of retirement, the</a>

<a id='line_793'>      pride and ignorance of a Grecian princess; 38 from the dukes, by</a>
<a id='line_794'>      the ignorance and flattery of the Italian subjects. 39 His</a>
<a id='line_795'>      genuine descent may be ascribed to the second or middle order of</a>
<a id='line_796'>      private nobility. 40 He sprang from a race of valvassors or</a>
<a id='line_797'>      bannerets, of the diocese of Coutances, in the Lower Normandy:</a>
<a id='line_798'>      the castle of Hauteville was their honorable seat: his father</a>
<a id='line_799'>      Tancred was conspicuous in the court and army of the duke; and</a>
<a id='line_800'>      his military service was furnished by ten soldiers or knights.</a>
<a id='line_801'>      Two marriages, of a rank not unworthy of his own, made him the</a>
<a id='line_802'>      father of twelve sons, who were educated at home by the impartial</a>
<a id='line_803'>      tenderness of his second wife. But a narrow patrimony was</a>
<a id='line_804'>      insufficient for this numerous and daring progeny; they saw</a>
<a id='line_805'>      around the neighborhood the mischiefs of poverty and discord, and</a>
<a id='line_806'>      resolved to seek in foreign wars a more glorious inheritance. Two</a>
<a id='line_807'>      only remained to perpetuate the race, and cherish their father’s</a>
<a id='line_808'>      age: their ten brothers, as they successfully attained the vigor</a>
<a id='line_809'>      of manhood, departed from the castle, passed the Alps, and joined</a>
<a id='line_810'>      the Apulian camp of the Normans. The elder were prompted by</a>
<a id='line_811'>      native spirit; their success encouraged their younger brethren,</a>
<a id='line_812'>      and the three first in seniority, William, Drogo, and Humphrey,</a>
<a id='line_813'>      deserved to be the chiefs of their nation and the founders of the</a>
<a id='line_814'>      new republic. Robert was the eldest of the seven sons of the</a>
<a id='line_815'>      second marriage; and even the reluctant praise of his foes has</a>
<a id='line_816'>      endowed him with the heroic qualities of a soldier and a</a>
<a id='line_817'>      statesman. His lofty stature surpassed the tallest of his army:</a>
<a id='line_818'>      his limbs were cast in the true proportion of strength and</a>
<a id='line_819'>      gracefulness; and to the decline of life, he maintained the</a>
<a id='line_820'>      patient vigor of health and the commanding dignity of his form.</a>
<a id='line_821'>      His complexion was ruddy, his shoulders were broad, his hair and</a>
<a id='line_822'>      beard were long and of a flaxen color, his eyes sparkled with</a>
<a id='line_823'>      fire, and his voice, like that of Achilles, could impress</a>
<a id='line_824'>      obedience and terror amidst the tumult of battle. In the ruder</a>
<a id='line_825'>      ages of chivalry, such qualifications are not below the notice of</a>
<a id='line_826'>      the poet or historians: they may observe that Robert, at once,</a>
<a id='line_827'>      and with equal dexterity, could wield in the right hand his</a>
<a id='line_828'>      sword, his lance in the left; that in the battle of Civitella he</a>
<a id='line_829'>      was thrice unhorsed; and that in the close of that memorable day</a>
<a id='line_830'>      he was adjudged to have borne away the prize of valor from the</a>
<a id='line_831'>      warriors of the two armies. 41 His boundless ambition was founded</a>
<a id='line_832'>      on the consciousness of superior worth: in the pursuit of</a>
<a id='line_833'>      greatness, he was never arrested by the scruples of justice, and</a>
<a id='line_834'>      seldom moved by the feelings of humanity: though not insensible</a>
<a id='line_835'>      of fame, the choice of open or clandestine means was determined</a>
<a id='line_836'>      only by his present advantage. The surname of Guiscard 42 was</a>
<a id='line_837'>      applied to this master of political wisdom, which is too often</a>
<a id='line_838'>      confounded with the practice of dissimulation and deceit; and</a>
<a id='line_839'>      Robert is praised by the Apulian poet for excelling the cunning</a>
<a id='line_840'>      of Ulysses and the eloquence of Cicero. Yet these arts were</a>
<a id='line_841'>      disguised by an appearance of military frankness: in his highest</a>
<a id='line_842'>      fortune, he was accessible and courteous to his fellow-soldiers;</a>
<a id='line_843'>      and while he indulged the prejudices of his new subjects, he</a>
<a id='line_844'>      affected in his dress and manners to maintain the ancient fashion</a>
<a id='line_845'>      of his country. He grasped with a rapacious, that he might</a>
<a id='line_846'>      distribute with a liberal, hand: his primitive indigence had</a>
<a id='line_847'>      taught the habits of frugality; the gain of a merchant was not</a>
<a id='line_848'>      below his attention; and his prisoners were tortured with slow</a>
<a id='line_849'>      and unfeeling cruelty, to force a discovery of their secret</a>
<a id='line_850'>      treasure. According to the Greeks, he departed from Normandy with</a>
<a id='line_851'>      only five followers on horseback and thirty on foot; yet even</a>
<a id='line_852'>      this allowance appears too bountiful: the sixth son of Tancred of</a>
<a id='line_853'>      Hauteville passed the Alps as a pilgrim; and his first military</a>
<a id='line_854'>      band was levied among the adventurers of Italy. His brothers and</a>
<a id='line_855'>      countrymen had divided the fertile lands of Apulia; but they</a>
<a id='line_856'>      guarded their shares with the jealousy of avarice; the aspiring</a>
<a id='line_857'>      youth was driven forwards to the mountains of Calabria, and in</a>
<a id='line_858'>      his first exploits against the Greeks and the natives, it is not</a>
<a id='line_859'>      easy to discriminate the hero from the robber. To surprise a</a>
<a id='line_860'>      castle or a convent, to ensnare a wealthy citizen, to plunder the</a>
<a id='line_861'>      adjacent villages for necessary food, were the obscure labors</a>
<a id='line_862'>      which formed and exercised the powers of his mind and body. The</a>

<a id='line_963'>      but in these domestic feuds, his years, and the national</a>

<a id='line_968'>      defence; the Normans were accustomed to serve on horseback in the</a>
<a id='line_969'>      field, and their rude attempts could only succeed by the efforts</a>

<a id='line_1138'>      these base practices he rose to the merit and glory of a holy</a>
<a id='line_1139'>      war; and the invasion of Sicily was seconded by the zeal and</a>

<a id='line_1147'>      sixty soldiers on a hostile shore; drove the Saracens to the</a>

<a id='line_1149'>      adjacent country. In the fortress of Trani, his active and</a>
<a id='line_1150'>      patient courage were equally conspicuous. In his old age he</a>
<a id='line_1151'>      related with pleasure, that, by the distress of the siege,</a>
<a id='line_1152'>      himself, and the countess his wife, had been reduced to a single</a>
<a id='line_1153'>      cloak or mantle, which they wore alternately; that in a sally his</a>
<a id='line_1154'>      horse had been slain, and he was dragged away by the Saracens;</a>
<a id='line_1155'>      but that he owed his rescue to his good sword, and had retreated</a>
<a id='line_1156'>      with his saddle on his back, lest the meanest trophy might be</a>

<a id='line_1158'>      hundred Normans withstood and repulsed the forces of the island.</a>
<a id='line_1159'>      In the field of Ceramio, fifty thousand horse and foot were</a>
<a id='line_1160'>      overthrown by one hundred and thirty-six Christian soldiers,</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      without reckoning St. George, who fought on horseback in the</a>
<a id='line_1162'>      foremost ranks. The captive banners, with four camels, were</a>
<a id='line_1163'>      reserved for the successor of St. Peter; and had these barbaric</a>
<a id='line_1164'>      spoils been exposed, not in the Vatican, but in the Capitol, they</a>
<a id='line_1165'>      might have revived the memory of the Punic triumphs. These</a>
<a id='line_1166'>      insufficient numbers of the Normans most probably denote their</a>
<a id='line_1167'>      knights, the soldiers of honorable and equestrian rank, each of</a>

<a id='line_1177'>      emulation. After a war of thirty years, 55 Roger, with the title</a>
<a id='line_1178'>      of great count, obtained the sovereignty of the largest and most</a>

<a id='line_1186'>      perusal, preferred the work of the Arabian to the writings of the</a>
<a id='line_1187'>      Grecian Ptolemy. 57 A remnant of Christian natives had promoted</a>
<a id='line_1188'>      the success of the Normans: they were rewarded by the triumph of</a>
<a id='line_1189'>      the cross. The island was restored to the jurisdiction of the</a>

<a id='line_1251'>      To Robert Guiscard, the conquest of Sicily was more glorious than</a>
<a id='line_1252'>      beneficial: the possession of Apulia and Calabria was inadequate</a>
<a id='line_1253'>      to his ambition; and he resolved to embrace or create the first</a>
<a id='line_1254'>      occasion of invading, perhaps of subduing, the Roman empire of</a>
<a id='line_1255'>      the East. 59 From his first wife, the partner of his humble</a>
<a id='line_1256'>      fortune, he had been divorced under the pretence of</a>
<a id='line_1257'>      consanguinity; and her son Bohemond was destined to imitate,</a>
<a id='line_1258'>      rather than to succeed, his illustrious father. The second wife</a>
<a id='line_1259'>      of Guiscard was the daughter of the princes of Salerno; the</a>
<a id='line_1260'>      Lombards acquiesced in the lineal succession of their son Roger;</a>
<a id='line_1261'>      their five daughters were given in honorable nuptials, 60 and one</a>
<a id='line_1262'>      of them was betrothed, in a tender age, to Constantine, a</a>
<a id='line_1263'>      beautiful youth, the son and heir of the emperor Michael. 61 But</a>
<a id='line_1264'>      the throne of Constantinople was shaken by a revolution: the</a>
<a id='line_1265'>      Imperial family of Ducas was confined to the palace or the</a>
<a id='line_1266'>      cloister; and Robert deplored, and resented, the disgrace of his</a>
<a id='line_1267'>      daughter and the expulsion of his ally. A Greek, who styled</a>
<a id='line_1268'>      himself the father of Constantine, soon appeared at Salerno, and</a>
<a id='line_1269'>      related the adventures of his fall and flight. That unfortunate</a>
<a id='line_1270'>      friend was acknowledged by the duke, and adorned with the pomp</a>
<a id='line_1271'>      and titles of Imperial dignity: in his triumphal progress through</a>
<a id='line_1272'>      Apulia and Calabria, Michael 62 was saluted with the tears and</a>
<a id='line_1273'>      acclamations of the people; and Pope Gregory the Seventh exhorted</a>
<a id='line_1274'>      the bishops to preach, and the Catholics to fight, in the pious</a>
<a id='line_1275'>      work of his restoration. His conversations with Robert were</a>
<a id='line_1276'>      frequent and familiar; and their mutual promises were justified</a>
<a id='line_1277'>      by the valor of the Normans and the treasures of the East. Yet</a>
<a id='line_1278'>      this Michael, by the confession of the Greeks and Latins, was a</a>
<a id='line_1279'>      pageant and an impostor; a monk who had fled from his convent, or</a>
<a id='line_1280'>      a domestic who had served in the palace. The fraud had been</a>
<a id='line_1281'>      contrived by the subtle Guiscard; and he trusted, that after this</a>
<a id='line_1282'>      pretender had given a decent color to his arms, he would sink, at</a>
<a id='line_1283'>      the nod of the conqueror, into his primitive obscurity. But</a>
<a id='line_1284'>      victory was the only argument that could determine the belief of</a>
<a id='line_1285'>      the Greeks; and the ardor of the Latins was much inferior to</a>
<a id='line_1286'>      their credulity: the Norman veterans wished to enjoy the harvest</a>
<a id='line_1287'>      of their toils, and the unwarlike Italians trembled at the known</a>
<a id='line_1288'>      and unknown dangers of a transmarine expedition. In his new</a>
<a id='line_1289'>      levies, Robert exerted the influence of gifts and promises, the</a>
<a id='line_1290'>      terrors of civil and ecclesiastical authority; and some acts of</a>
<a id='line_1291'>      violence might justify the reproach, that age and infancy were</a>
<a id='line_1292'>      pressed without distinction into the service of their unrelenting</a>
<a id='line_1293'>      prince. After two years’ incessant preparations the land and</a>

<a id='line_1365'>      maintained the character of soldiers. In the prosecution of his</a>
<a id='line_1366'>      enterprise, the courage of Guiscard was assailed by every form of</a>
<a id='line_1367'>      danger and mischance. In the most propitious season of the year,</a>
<a id='line_1368'>      as his fleet passed along the coast, a storm of wind and snow</a>
<a id='line_1369'>      unexpectedly arose: the Adriatic was swelled by the raging blast</a>
<a id='line_1370'>      of the south, and a new shipwreck confirmed the old infamy of the</a>
<a id='line_1371'>      Acroceraunian rocks. 67 The sails, the masts, and the oars, were</a>
<a id='line_1372'>      shattered or torn away; the sea and shore were covered with the</a>
<a id='line_1373'>      fragments of vessels, with arms and dead bodies; and the greatest</a>
<a id='line_1374'>      part of the provisions were either drowned or damaged. The ducal</a>

<a id='line_1376'>      seven days on the adjacent cape, to collect the relics of his</a>

<a id='line_1378'>      Normans were no longer the bold and experienced mariners who had</a>
<a id='line_1379'>      explored the ocean from Greenland to Mount Atlas, and who smiled</a>
<a id='line_1380'>      at the petty dangers of the Mediterranean. They had wept during</a>

<a id='line_1382'>      Venetians, who had been solicited by the prayers and promises of</a>

<a id='line_1384'>      disadvantageous to Bohemond, a beardless youth, 68 who led the</a>
<a id='line_1385'>      naval powers of his father. All night the galleys of the republic</a>
<a id='line_1386'>      lay on their anchors in the form of a crescent; and the victory</a>
<a id='line_1387'>      of the second day was decided by the dexterity of their</a>
<a id='line_1388'>      evolutions, the station of their archers, the weight of their</a>
<a id='line_1389'>      javelins, and the borrowed aid of the Greek fire. The Apulian and</a>
<a id='line_1390'>      Ragusian vessels fled to the shore, several were cut from their</a>
<a id='line_1391'>      cables, and dragged away by the conqueror; and a sally from the</a>
<a id='line_1392'>      town carried slaughter and dismay to the tents of the Norman</a>

<a id='line_1394'>      the besiegers had lost the command of the sea, the islands and</a>

<a id='line_1470'>      revenge. They were entertained in the service of the Greek</a>
<a id='line_1471'>      emperor; and their first station was in a new city on the Asiatic</a>
<a id='line_1472'>      shore: but Alexius soon recalled them to the defence of his</a>
<a id='line_1473'>      person and palace; and bequeathed to his successors the</a>
<a id='line_1474'>      inheritance of their faith and valor. 70 The name of a Norman</a>
<a id='line_1475'>      invader revived the memory of their wrongs: they marched with</a>
<a id='line_1476'>      alacrity against the national foe, and panted to regain in Epirus</a>
<a id='line_1477'>      the glory which they had lost in the battle of Hastings. The</a>
<a id='line_1478'>      Varangians were supported by some companies of Franks or Latins;</a>
<a id='line_1479'>      and the rebels, who had fled to Constantinople from the tyranny</a>
<a id='line_1480'>      of Guiscard, were eager to signalize their zeal and gratify their</a>
<a id='line_1481'>      revenge. In this emergency, the emperor had not disdained the</a>
<a id='line_1482'>      impure aid of the Paulicians or Manichaeans of Thrace and</a>
<a id='line_1483'>      Bulgaria; and these heretics united with the patience of</a>
<a id='line_1484'>      martyrdom the spirit and discipline of active valor. 71 The</a>
<a id='line_1485'>      treaty with the sultan had procured a supply of some thousand</a>
<a id='line_1486'>      Turks; and the arrows of the Scythian horse were opposed to the</a>
<a id='line_1487'>      lances of the Norman cavalry. On the report and distant prospect</a>
<a id='line_1488'>      of these formidable numbers, Robert assembled a council of his</a>
<a id='line_1489'>      principal officers. “You behold,” said he, “your danger: it is</a>
<a id='line_1490'>      urgent and inevitable. The hills are covered with arms and</a>
<a id='line_1491'>      standards; and the emperor of the Greeks is accustomed to wars</a>
<a id='line_1492'>      and triumphs. Obedience and union are our only safety; and I am</a>
<a id='line_1493'>      ready to yield the command to a more worthy leader.” The vote and</a>
<a id='line_1494'>      acclamation even of his secret enemies, assured him, in that</a>
<a id='line_1495'>      perilous moment, of their esteem and confidence; and the duke</a>
<a id='line_1496'>      thus continued: “Let us trust in the rewards of victory, and</a>
<a id='line_1497'>      deprive cowardice of the means of escape. Let us burn our vessels</a>
<a id='line_1498'>      and our baggage, and give battle on this spot, as if it were the</a>
<a id='line_1499'>      place of our nativity and our burial.” The resolution was</a>
<a id='line_1500'>      unanimously approved; and, without confining himself to his</a>
<a id='line_1501'>      lines, Guiscard awaited in battle-array the nearer approach of</a>
<a id='line_1502'>      the enemy. His rear was covered by a small river; his right wing</a>
<a id='line_1503'>      extended to the sea; his left to the hills: nor was he conscious,</a>
<a id='line_1504'>      perhaps, that on the same ground Caesar and Pompey had formerly</a>

<a id='line_1556'>      cried aloud, “whither do ye fly? Your enemy is implacable; and</a>

<a id='line_1559'>      nakedness of their flanks: the main battle of the duke, of eight</a>
<a id='line_1560'>      hundred knights, stood firm and entire; they couched their</a>
<a id='line_1561'>      lances, and the Greeks bore the furious and irresistible shock of</a>
<a id='line_1562'>      the French cavalry. 75 Alexius was not deficient in the duties of</a>
<a id='line_1563'>      a soldier or a general; but he no sooner beheld the slaughter of</a>

<a id='line_1653'>      Achilles, 79 which contained the treasure and magazines of the</a>

<a id='line_1655'>      fortitude and prudence of Alexius, who bravely struggled with the</a>
<a id='line_1656'>      calamities of the times. In the poverty of the state, he presumed</a>

<a id='line_1660'>      revenged the loss of their brethren; and the Greek soldiers were</a>
<a id='line_1661'>      exercised to ride, to draw the bow, and to the daily practice of</a>
<a id='line_1662'>      ambuscades and evolutions. Alexius had been taught by experience,</a>
<a id='line_1663'>      that the formidable cavalry of the Franks on foot was unfit for</a>
<a id='line_1664'>      action, and almost incapable of motion; 80 his archers were</a>

<a id='line_1668'>      Larissa the events of war were protracted and balanced. The</a>
<a id='line_1669'>      courage of Bohemond was always conspicuous, and often successful;</a>

<a id='line_1712'>      West. The epistle of the Greek monarch 81 to his brother is</a>
<a id='line_1713'>      filled with the warmest professions of friendship, and the most</a>
<a id='line_1714'>      lively desire of strengthening their alliance by every public and</a>
<a id='line_1715'>      private tie. He congratulates Henry on his success in a just and</a>
<a id='line_1716'>      pious war; and complains that the prosperity of his own empire is</a>
<a id='line_1717'>      disturbed by the audacious enterprises of the Norman Robert. The</a>
<a id='line_1718'>      lists of his presents expresses the manners of the age—a radiated</a>
<a id='line_1719'>      crown of gold, a cross set with pearls to hang on the breast, a</a>
<a id='line_1720'>      case of relics, with the names and titles of the saints, a vase</a>
<a id='line_1721'>      of crystal, a vase of sardonyx, some balm, most probably of</a>
<a id='line_1722'>      Mecca, and one hundred pieces of purple. To these he added a more</a>
<a id='line_1723'>      solid present, of one hundred and forty-four thousand Byzantines</a>
<a id='line_1724'>      of gold, with a further assurance of two hundred and sixteen</a>
<a id='line_1725'>      thousand, so soon as Henry should have entered in arms the</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      Apulian territories, and confirmed by an oath the league against</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      the common enemy. The German, 82 who was already in Lombardy at</a>
<a id='line_1728'>      the head of an army and a faction, accepted these liberal offers,</a>
<a id='line_1729'>      and marched towards the south: his speed was checked by the sound</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      of the battle of Durazzo; but the influence of his arms, or name,</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      in the hasty return of Robert, was a full equivalent for the</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      Grecian bribe. Henry was the severe adversary of the Normans, the</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      allies and vassals of Gregory the Seventh, his implacable foe.</a>
<a id='line_1734'>      The long quarrel of the throne and mitre had been recently</a>
<a id='line_1735'>      kindled by the zeal and ambition of that haughty priest: 83 the</a>
<a id='line_1736'>      king and the pope had degraded each other; and each had seated a</a>
<a id='line_1737'>      rival on the temporal or spiritual throne of his antagonist.</a>
<a id='line_1738'>      After the defeat and death of his Swabian rebel, Henry descended</a>
<a id='line_1739'>      into Italy, to assume the Imperial crown, and to drive from the</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      Vatican the tyrant of the church. 84 But the Roman people adhered</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      to the cause of Gregory: their resolution was fortified by</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      supplies of men and money from Apulia; and the city was thrice</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      ineffectually besieged by the king of Germany. In the fourth year</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      he corrupted, as it is said, with Byzantine gold, the nobles of</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      Rome, whose estates and castles had been ruined by the war. The</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      gates, the bridges, and fifty hostages, were delivered into his</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      hands: the anti-pope, Clement the Third, was consecrated in the</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      Lateran: the grateful pontiff crowned his protector in the</a>
<a id='line_1749'>      Vatican; and the emperor Henry fixed his residence in the</a>
<a id='line_1750'>      Capitol, as the lawful successor of Augustus and Charlemagne. The</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      ruins of the Septizonium were still defended by the nephew of</a>
<a id='line_1752'>      Gregory: the pope himself was invested in the castle of St.</a>
<a id='line_1753'>      Angelo; and his last hope was in the courage and fidelity of his</a>
<a id='line_1754'>      Norman vassal. Their friendship had been interrupted by some</a>
<a id='line_1755'>      reciprocal injuries and complaints; but, on this pressing</a>
<a id='line_1756'>      occasion, Guiscard was urged by the obligation of his oath, by</a>
<a id='line_1757'>      his interest, more potent than oaths, by the love of fame, and</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      his enmity to the two emperors. Unfurling the holy banner, he</a>
<a id='line_1759'>      resolved to fly to the relief of the prince of the apostles: the</a>
<a id='line_1760'>      most numerous of his armies, six thousand horse, and thirty</a>
<a id='line_1761'>      thousand foot, was instantly assembled; and his march from</a>
<a id='line_1762'>      Salerno to Rome was animated by the public applause and the</a>
<a id='line_1763'>      promise of the divine favor. Henry, invincible in sixty-six</a>
<a id='line_1764'>      battles, trembled at his approach; recollected some indispensable</a>
<a id='line_1765'>      affairs that required his presence in Lombardy; exhorted the</a>
<a id='line_1766'>      Romans to persevere in their allegiance; and hastily retreated</a>
<a id='line_1767'>      three days before the entrance of the Normans. In less than three</a>
<a id='line_1768'>      years, the son of Tancred of Hauteville enjoyed the glory of</a>
<a id='line_1769'>      delivering the pope, and of compelling the two emperors, of the</a>
<a id='line_1770'>      East and West, to fly before his victorious arms. 85 But the</a>
<a id='line_1771'>      triumph of Robert was clouded by the calamities of Rome. By the</a>
<a id='line_1772'>      aid of the friends of Gregory, the walls had been perforated or</a>
<a id='line_1773'>      scaled; but the Imperial faction was still powerful and active;</a>
<a id='line_1774'>      on the third day, the people rose in a furious tumult; and a</a>
<a id='line_1775'>      hasty word of the conqueror, in his defence or revenge, was the</a>
<a id='line_1776'>      signal of fire and pillage. 86 The Saracens of Sicily, the</a>
<a id='line_1777'>      subjects of Roger, and auxiliaries of his brother, embraced this</a>
<a id='line_1778'>      fair occasion of rifling and profaning the holy city of the</a>
<a id='line_1779'>      Christians: many thousands of the citizens, in the sight, and by</a>
<a id='line_1780'>      the allies, of their spiritual father were exposed to violation,</a>
<a id='line_1781'>      captivity, or death; and a spacious quarter of the city, from the</a>
<a id='line_1782'>      Lateran to the Coliseum, was consumed by the flames, and devoted</a>
<a id='line_1783'>      to perpetual solitude. 87 From a city, where he was now hated,</a>
<a id='line_1784'>      and might be no longer feared, Gregory retired to end his days in</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      the palace of Salerno. The artful pontiff might flatter the</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      vanity of Guiscard with the hope of a Roman or Imperial crown;</a>
<a id='line_1787'>      but this dangerous measure, which would have inflamed the</a>

<a id='line_1874'>      or the vigilance of Robert, the change of a wind, or the shelter</a>
<a id='line_1875'>      of a mist, opened a free passage; and the Norman troops were</a>
<a id='line_1876'>      safely disembarked on the coast of Epirus. With twenty strong and</a>

<a id='line_1882'>      the two former, the skill and numbers of the allies were</a>

<a id='line_1884'>      complete victory. 91 The light brigantines of the Greeks were</a>
<a id='line_1885'>      scattered in ignominious flight: the nine castles of the</a>
<a id='line_1886'>      Venetians maintained a more obstinate conflict; seven were sunk,</a>

<a id='line_1890'>      The want of experience had been supplied by the genius of</a>
<a id='line_1891'>      Guiscard; and each evening, when he had sounded a retreat, he</a>
<a id='line_1892'>      calmly explored the causes of his repulse, and invented new</a>
<a id='line_1893'>      methods how to remedy his own defects, and to baffle the</a>
<a id='line_1894'>      advantages of the enemy. The winter season suspended his</a>
<a id='line_1895'>      progress: with the return of spring he again aspired to the</a>
<a id='line_1896'>      conquest of Constantinople; but, instead of traversing the hills</a>
<a id='line_1897'>      of Epirus, he turned his arms against Greece and the islands,</a>
<a id='line_1898'>      where the spoils would repay the labor, and where the land and</a>
<a id='line_1899'>      sea forces might pursue their joint operations with vigor and</a>
<a id='line_1900'>      effect. But, in the Isle of Cephalonia, his projects were fatally</a>
<a id='line_1901'>      blasted by an epidemical disease: Robert himself, in the</a>
<a id='line_1902'>      seventieth year of his age, expired in his tent; and a suspicion</a>
<a id='line_1903'>      of poison was imputed, by public rumor, to his wife, or to the</a>
<a id='line_1904'>      Greek emperor. 92 This premature death might allow a boundless</a>
<a id='line_1905'>      scope for the imagination of his future exploits; and the event</a>
<a id='line_1906'>      sufficiently declares, that the Norman greatness was founded on</a>
<a id='line_1907'>      his life. 93 Without the appearance of an enemy, a victorious</a>
<a id='line_1908'>      army dispersed or retreated in disorder and consternation; and</a>
<a id='line_1909'>      Alexius, who had trembled for his empire, rejoiced in his</a>

<a id='line_2010'>      oath of fidelity from the Norman capital, commanded the</a>
<a id='line_2011'>      submission of the barons, and extorted a legal investiture from</a>
<a id='line_2012'>      the reluctant popes, who could not long endure either the</a>
<a id='line_2013'>      friendship or enmity of a powerful vassal. The sacred spot of</a>
<a id='line_2014'>      Benevento was respectfully spared, as the patrimony of St. Peter;</a>

<a id='line_2018'>      power and merit prompted him to disdain the titles of duke and of</a>
<a id='line_2019'>      count; and the Isle of Sicily, with a third perhaps of the</a>
<a id='line_2020'>      continent of Italy, might form the basis of a kingdom 99 which</a>
<a id='line_2021'>      would only yield to the monarchies of France and England. The</a>

<a id='line_2023'>      doubtless pronounce under what name he should reign over them;</a>
<a id='line_2024'>      but the example of a Greek tyrant or a Saracen emir was</a>
<a id='line_2025'>      insufficient to justify his regal character; and the nine kings</a>

<a id='line_2035'>      Germany, the excommunications of Innocent, the fleets of Pisa,</a>

<a id='line_2192'>      Athens, no memorial remains. The ancient walls, which</a>
<a id='line_2193'>      encompassed, without guarding, the opulence of Thebes, were</a>
<a id='line_2194'>      scaled by the Latin Christians; but their sole use of the gospel</a>
<a id='line_2195'>      was to sanctify an oath, that the lawful owners had not secreted</a>
<a id='line_2196'>      any relic of their inheritance or industry. On the approach of</a>
<a id='line_2197'>      the Normans, the lower town of Corinth was evacuated; the Greeks</a>
<a id='line_2198'>      retired to the citadel, which was seated on a lofty eminence,</a>
<a id='line_2199'>      abundantly watered by the classic fountain of Pirene; an</a>
<a id='line_2200'>      impregnable fortress, if the want of courage could be balanced by</a>
<a id='line_2201'>      any advantages of art or nature. As soon as the besiegers had</a>
<a id='line_2202'>      surmounted the labor (their sole labor) of climbing the hill,</a>
<a id='line_2203'>      their general, from the commanding eminence, admired his own</a>
<a id='line_2204'>      victory, and testified his gratitude to Heaven, by tearing from</a>
<a id='line_2205'>      the altar the precious image of Theodore, the tutelary saint. The</a>
<a id='line_2206'>      silk weavers of both sexes, whom George transported to Sicily,</a>
<a id='line_2207'>      composed the most valuable part of the spoil; and in comparing</a>
<a id='line_2208'>      the skilful industry of the mechanic with the sloth and cowardice</a>
<a id='line_2209'>      of the soldier, he was heard to exclaim that the distaff and loom</a>
<a id='line_2210'>      were the only weapons which the Greeks were capable of using. The</a>
<a id='line_2211'>      progress of this naval armament was marked by two conspicuous</a>
<a id='line_2212'>      events, the rescue of the king of France, and the insult of the</a>
<a id='line_2213'>      Byzantine capital. In his return by sea from an unfortunate</a>
<a id='line_2214'>      crusade, Louis the Seventh was intercepted by the Greeks, who</a>
<a id='line_2215'>      basely violated the laws of honor and religion. The fortunate</a>
<a id='line_2216'>      encounter of the Norman fleet delivered the royal captive; and</a>
<a id='line_2217'>      after a free and honorable entertainment in the court of Sicily,</a>
<a id='line_2218'>      Louis continued his journey to Rome and Paris. 110 In the absence</a>
<a id='line_2219'>      of the emperor, Constantinople and the Hellespont were left</a>
<a id='line_2220'>      without defence and without the suspicion of danger. The clergy</a>
<a id='line_2221'>      and people (for the soldiers had followed the standard of Manuel)</a>
<a id='line_2222'>      were astonished and dismayed at the hostile appearance of a line</a>
<a id='line_2223'>      of galleys, which boldly cast anchor in the front of the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_2224'>      city. The forces of the Sicilian admiral were inadequate to the</a>
<a id='line_2225'>      siege or assault of an immense and populous metropolis; but</a>
<a id='line_2226'>      George enjoyed the glory of humbling the Greek arrogance, and of</a>
<a id='line_2227'>      marking the path of conquest to the navies of the West. He landed</a>
<a id='line_2228'>      some soldiers to rifle the fruits of the royal gardens, and</a>
<a id='line_2229'>      pointed with silver, or most probably with fire, the arrows which</a>
<a id='line_2230'>      he discharged against the palace of the Caesars. 111 This playful</a>
<a id='line_2231'>      outrage of the pirates of Sicily, who had surprised an unguarded</a>
<a id='line_2232'>      moment, Manuel affected to despise, while his martial spirit, and</a>
<a id='line_2233'>      the forces of the empire, were awakened to revenge. The</a>
<a id='line_2234'>      Archipelago and Ionian Sea were covered with his squadrons and</a>
<a id='line_2235'>      those of Venice; but I know not by what favorable allowance of</a>

<a id='line_2240'>      homeward voyage George lost nineteen of his galleys, which were</a>

<a id='line_2310'>      were rebuilt by the contributions of Manuel; and he poured, says</a>

<a id='line_2312'>      attachment to the Greeks was fortified by the jealous enmity of</a>
<a id='line_2313'>      the Venetians. 114 The situation and trade of Ancona rendered it</a>
<a id='line_2314'>      an important garrison in the heart of Italy: it was twice</a>
<a id='line_2315'>      besieged by the arms of Frederic; the imperial forces were twice</a>

<a id='line_2318'>      the most faithful servants, were rewarded by the wealth and</a>
<a id='line_2319'>      honors of the Byzantine court. 115 The pride of Manuel disdained</a>
<a id='line_2320'>      and rejected a Barbarian colleague; his ambition was excited by</a>

<a id='line_2322'>      establishing, in the West, as in the East, his lawful title of</a>

<a id='line_2399'>      complete vengeance of these and of fresh injuries was reserved</a>
<a id='line_2400'>      for the succeeding generation. The lieutenant of Manuel had</a>
<a id='line_2401'>      informed his sovereign that he was strong enough to quell any</a>
<a id='line_2402'>      domestic revolt of Apulia and Calabria; but that his forces were</a>
<a id='line_2403'>      inadequate to resist the impending attack of the king of Sicily.</a>
<a id='line_2404'>      His prophecy was soon verified: the death of Palaeologus devolved</a>
<a id='line_2405'>      the command on several chiefs, alike eminent in rank, alike</a>

<a id='line_2408'>      Normans and Saracens, abjured all future hostility against the</a>
<a id='line_2409'>      person or dominions of their conqueror. 122 Yet the king of</a>
<a id='line_2410'>      Sicily esteemed the courage and constancy of Manuel, who had</a>
<a id='line_2411'>      landed a second army on the Italian shore; he respectfully</a>
<a id='line_2412'>      addressed the new Justinian; solicited a peace or truce of thirty</a>
<a id='line_2413'>      years, accepted as a gift the regal title; and acknowledged</a>
<a id='line_2414'>      himself the military vassal of the Roman empire. 123 The</a>
<a id='line_2415'>      Byzantine Caesars acquiesced in this shadow of dominion, without</a>
<a id='line_2416'>      expecting, perhaps without desiring, the service of a Norman</a>
<a id='line_2417'>      army; and the truce of thirty years was not disturbed by any</a>
<a id='line_2418'>      hostilities between Sicily and Constantinople. About the end of</a>
<a id='line_2419'>      that period, the throne of Manuel was usurped by an inhuman</a>
<a id='line_2420'>      tyrant, who had deserved the abhorrence of his country and</a>
<a id='line_2421'>      mankind: the sword of William the Second, the grandson of Roger,</a>
<a id='line_2422'>      was drawn by a fugitive of the Comnenian race; and the subjects</a>
<a id='line_2423'>      of Andronicus might salute the strangers as friends, since they</a>
<a id='line_2424'>      detested their sovereign as the worst of enemies. The Latin</a>
<a id='line_2425'>      historians 124 expatiate on the rapid progress of the four counts</a>

<a id='line_2657'>      imprudent allies. The last hope of Falcandus was defeated by the</a>

<a id='line_2660'>      surviving brethren fortified the mountains, and disturbed above</a>
<a id='line_2661'>      thirty years the peace of the island. By the policy of Frederic</a>
<a id='line_2662'>      the Second, sixty thousand Saracens were transplanted to Nocera</a>
<a id='line_2663'>      in Apulia. In their wars against the Roman church, the emperor</a>
<a id='line_2664'>      and his son Mainfroy were strengthened and disgraced by the</a>
