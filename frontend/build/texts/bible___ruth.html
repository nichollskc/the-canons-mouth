                    <a id='line_0'>The Book of Ruth</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that there</a>
<a id='line_4'>was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehemjudah went to</a>
<a id='line_5'>sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>1:2 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife</a>
<a id='line_8'>Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of</a>
<a id='line_9'>Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued</a>
<a id='line_10'>there.</a>
<a id='line_11'></a>
<a id='line_12'>1:3 And Elimelech Naomi’s husband died; and she was left, and her two</a>
<a id='line_13'>sons.</a>
<a id='line_14'></a>
<a id='line_15'>1:4 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the one</a>
<a id='line_16'>was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they dwelled there</a>
<a id='line_17'>about ten years.</a>
<a id='line_18'></a>
<a id='line_19'>1:5 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman was</a>
<a id='line_20'>left of her two sons and her husband.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>1:6 Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might return</a>
<a id='line_23'>from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the country of Moab how</a>
<a id='line_24'>that the LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.</a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'>1:7 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and her</a>
<a id='line_27'>two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to return unto</a>
<a id='line_28'>the land of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>1:8 And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each to</a>
<a id='line_31'>her mother’s house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt</a>
<a id='line_32'>with the dead, and with me.</a>
<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'>1:9 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house</a>
<a id='line_35'>of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up their voice,</a>
<a id='line_36'>and wept.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>1:10 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto thy</a>
<a id='line_39'>people.</a>
<a id='line_40'></a>
<a id='line_41'>1:11 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with me?</a>
<a id='line_42'>are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be your</a>
<a id='line_43'>husbands?  1:12 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too</a>
<a id='line_44'>old to have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should have</a>
<a id='line_45'>an husband also to night, and should also bear sons; 1:13 Would ye</a>
<a id='line_46'>tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay for them from</a>
<a id='line_47'>having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it grieveth me much for your</a>
<a id='line_48'>sakes that the hand of the LORD is gone out against me.</a>
<a id='line_49'></a>
<a id='line_50'>1:14 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah kissed</a>
<a id='line_51'>her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>1:15 And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her</a>
<a id='line_54'>people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in law.</a>
<a id='line_55'></a>
<a id='line_56'>1:16 And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from</a>
<a id='line_57'>following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and where</a>
<a id='line_58'>thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my people, and thy God</a>
<a id='line_59'>my God: 1:17 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried:</a>
<a id='line_60'>the LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee and</a>
<a id='line_61'>me.</a>
<a id='line_62'></a>
<a id='line_63'>1:18 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her, then</a>
<a id='line_64'>she left speaking unto her.</a>
<a id='line_65'></a>
<a id='line_66'>1:19 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to</a>
<a id='line_67'>pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved</a>
<a id='line_68'>about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?  1:20 And she said unto</a>
<a id='line_69'>them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for the Almighty hath dealt</a>
<a id='line_70'>very bitterly with me.</a>
<a id='line_71'></a>
<a id='line_72'>1:21 I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty:</a>
<a id='line_73'>why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified against me,</a>
<a id='line_74'>and the Almighty hath afflicted me?  1:22 So Naomi returned, and Ruth</a>
<a id='line_75'>the Moabitess, her daughter in law, with her, which returned out of</a>
<a id='line_76'>the country of Moab: and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of</a>
<a id='line_77'>barley harvest.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>2:1 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband’s, a mighty man of wealth,</a>
<a id='line_80'>of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.</a>
<a id='line_81'></a>
<a id='line_82'>2:2 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the</a>
<a id='line_83'>field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall find</a>
<a id='line_84'>grace.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.</a>
<a id='line_87'></a>
<a id='line_88'>2:3 And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the</a>
<a id='line_89'>reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field belonging</a>
<a id='line_90'>unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>2:4 And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the reapers,</a>
<a id='line_93'>The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD bless thee.</a>
<a id='line_94'></a>
<a id='line_95'>2:5 Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers,</a>
<a id='line_96'>Whose damsel is this?  2:6 And the servant that was set over the</a>
<a id='line_97'>reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back</a>
<a id='line_98'>with Naomi out of the country of Moab: 2:7 And she said, I pray you,</a>
<a id='line_99'>let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves: so she</a>
<a id='line_100'>came, and hath continued even from the morning until now, that she</a>
<a id='line_101'>tarried a little in the house.</a>
<a id='line_102'></a>
<a id='line_103'>2:8 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go not to</a>
<a id='line_104'>glean in another field, neither go from hence, but abide here fast by</a>
<a id='line_105'>my maidens: 2:9 Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and</a>
<a id='line_106'>go thou after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall</a>
<a id='line_107'>not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the vessels, and</a>
<a id='line_108'>drink of that which the young men have drawn.</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>
<a id='line_110'>2:10 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and</a>
<a id='line_111'>said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that thou</a>
<a id='line_112'>shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?  2:11 And Boaz</a>
<a id='line_113'>answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed me, all that</a>
<a id='line_114'>thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the death of thine</a>
<a id='line_115'>husband: and how thou hast left thy father and thy mother, and the</a>
<a id='line_116'>land of thy nativity, and art come unto a people which thou knewest</a>
<a id='line_117'>not heretofore.</a>
<a id='line_118'></a>
<a id='line_119'>2:12 The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of</a>
<a id='line_120'>the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to trust.</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>2:13 Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for that</a>
<a id='line_123'>thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto</a>
<a id='line_124'>thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of thine handmaidens.</a>
<a id='line_125'></a>
<a id='line_126'>2:14 And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat of</a>
<a id='line_127'>the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the</a>
<a id='line_128'>reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she did eat, and was</a>
<a id='line_129'>sufficed, and left.</a>
<a id='line_130'></a>
<a id='line_131'>2:15 And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men,</a>
<a id='line_132'>saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and reproach her not:</a>
<a id='line_133'>2:16 And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and</a>
<a id='line_134'>leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>2:17 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she had</a>
<a id='line_137'>gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.</a>
<a id='line_138'></a>
<a id='line_139'>2:18 And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in law</a>
<a id='line_140'>saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave to her that</a>
<a id='line_141'>she had reserved after she was sufficed.</a>
<a id='line_142'></a>
<a id='line_143'>2:19 And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned to</a>
<a id='line_144'>day?  and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take knowledge</a>
<a id='line_145'>of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom she had wrought,</a>
<a id='line_146'>and said, The man’s name with whom I wrought to day is Boaz.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>2:20 And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the</a>
<a id='line_149'>LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to the</a>
<a id='line_150'>dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto us, one of</a>
<a id='line_151'>our next kinsmen.</a>
<a id='line_152'></a>
<a id='line_153'>2:21 And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_154'>keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.</a>
<a id='line_155'></a>
<a id='line_156'>2:22 And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my</a>
<a id='line_157'>daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet thee not</a>
<a id='line_158'>in any other field.</a>
<a id='line_159'></a>
<a id='line_160'>2:23 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end of</a>
<a id='line_161'>barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her mother in law.</a>
<a id='line_162'></a>
<a id='line_163'>3:1 Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall I</a>
<a id='line_164'>not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?  3:2 And now is</a>
<a id='line_165'>not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou wast?  Behold, he</a>
<a id='line_166'>winnoweth barley to night in the threshingfloor.</a>
<a id='line_167'></a>
<a id='line_168'>3:3 Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon</a>
<a id='line_169'>thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not thyself known unto</a>
<a id='line_170'>the man, until he shall have done eating and drinking.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>3:4 And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the</a>
<a id='line_173'>place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover his feet,</a>
<a id='line_174'>and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou shalt do.</a>
<a id='line_175'></a>
<a id='line_176'>3:5 And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.</a>
<a id='line_177'></a>
<a id='line_178'>3:6 And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all that</a>
<a id='line_179'>her mother in law bade her.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>3:7 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he</a>
<a id='line_182'>went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came softly,</a>
<a id='line_183'>and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.</a>
<a id='line_184'></a>
<a id='line_185'>3:8 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and</a>
<a id='line_186'>turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.</a>
<a id='line_187'></a>
<a id='line_188'>3:9 And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine</a>
<a id='line_189'>handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for thou art</a>
<a id='line_190'>a near kinsman.</a>
<a id='line_191'></a>
<a id='line_192'>3:10 And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for thou</a>
<a id='line_193'>hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning,</a>
<a id='line_194'>inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether poor or rich.</a>
<a id='line_195'></a>
<a id='line_196'>3:11 And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that thou</a>
<a id='line_197'>requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that thou art a</a>
<a id='line_198'>virtuous woman.</a>
<a id='line_199'></a>
<a id='line_200'>3:12 And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there is a</a>
<a id='line_201'>kinsman nearer than I.</a>
<a id='line_202'></a>
<a id='line_203'>3:13 Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will</a>
<a id='line_204'>perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the</a>
<a id='line_205'>kinsman’s part: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee,</a>
<a id='line_206'>then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee, as the LORD liveth: lie</a>
<a id='line_207'>down until the morning.</a>
<a id='line_208'></a>
<a id='line_209'>3:14 And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up before</a>
<a id='line_210'>one could know another. And he said, Let it not be known that a woman</a>
<a id='line_211'>came into the floor.</a>
<a id='line_212'></a>
<a id='line_213'>3:15 Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and hold</a>
<a id='line_214'>it.</a>
<a id='line_215'></a>
<a id='line_216'>And when she held it, he measured six measures of barley, and laid it</a>
<a id='line_217'>on her: and she went into the city.</a>
<a id='line_218'></a>
<a id='line_219'>3:16 And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art thou,</a>
<a id='line_220'>my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</a>
<a id='line_221'></a>
<a id='line_222'>3:17 And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he</a>
<a id='line_223'>said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.</a>
<a id='line_224'></a>
<a id='line_225'>3:18 Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the</a>
<a id='line_226'>matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he have</a>
<a id='line_227'>finished the thing this day.</a>
<a id='line_228'></a>
<a id='line_229'>4:1 Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and,</a>
<a id='line_230'>behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he said, Ho,</a>
<a id='line_231'>such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat</a>
<a id='line_232'>down.</a>
<a id='line_233'></a>
<a id='line_234'>4:2 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye</a>
<a id='line_235'>down here. And they sat down.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>4:3 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of the</a>
<a id='line_238'>country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our brother</a>
<a id='line_239'>Elimelech’s: 4:4 And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it</a>
<a id='line_240'>before the inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou</a>
<a id='line_241'>wilt redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then tell</a>
<a id='line_242'>me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it beside thee; and I</a>
<a id='line_243'>am after thee. And he said, I will redeem it.</a>
<a id='line_244'></a>
<a id='line_245'>4:5 Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of</a>
<a id='line_246'>Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the</a>
<a id='line_247'>dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_248'></a>
<a id='line_249'>4:6 And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I mar</a>
<a id='line_250'>mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for I cannot</a>
<a id='line_251'>redeem it.</a>
<a id='line_252'></a>
<a id='line_253'>4:7 Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning</a>
<a id='line_254'>redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man</a>
<a id='line_255'>plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a</a>
<a id='line_256'>testimony in Israel.</a>
<a id='line_257'></a>
<a id='line_258'>4:8 Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he drew</a>
<a id='line_259'>off his shoe.</a>
<a id='line_260'></a>
<a id='line_261'>4:9 And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are</a>
<a id='line_262'>witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech’s, and</a>
<a id='line_263'>all that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s, of the hand of Naomi.</a>
<a id='line_264'></a>
<a id='line_265'>4:10 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I purchased</a>
<a id='line_266'>to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance,</a>
<a id='line_267'>that the name of the dead be not cut off from among his brethren, and</a>
<a id='line_268'>from the gate of his place: ye are witnesses this day.</a>
<a id='line_269'></a>
<a id='line_270'>4:11 And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders, said,</a>
<a id='line_271'>We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come into thine</a>
<a id='line_272'>house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of</a>
<a id='line_273'>Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah, and be famous in Bethlehem:</a>
<a id='line_274'>4:12 And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare</a>
<a id='line_275'>unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this young</a>
<a id='line_276'>woman.</a>
<a id='line_277'></a>
<a id='line_278'>4:13 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in unto</a>
<a id='line_279'>her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>4:14 And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath</a>
<a id='line_282'>not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be famous</a>
<a id='line_283'>in Israel.</a>
<a id='line_284'></a>
<a id='line_285'>4:15 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher</a>
<a id='line_286'>of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which loveth thee, which is</a>
<a id='line_287'>better to thee than seven sons, hath born him.</a>
<a id='line_288'></a>
<a id='line_289'>4:16 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became</a>
<a id='line_290'>nurse unto it.</a>
<a id='line_291'></a>
<a id='line_292'>4:17 And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is a</a>
<a id='line_293'>son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the father of</a>
<a id='line_294'>Jesse, the father of David.</a>
<a id='line_295'></a>
<a id='line_296'>4:18 Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,</a>
<a id='line_297'>4:19 And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab, 4:20 And Amminadab</a>
<a id='line_298'>begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon, 4:21 And Salmon begat Boaz,</a>
<a id='line_299'>and Boaz begat Obed, 4:22 And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.</a>
