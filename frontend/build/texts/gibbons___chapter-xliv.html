<a id='line_26'>      this chapter, with additional notes, by one of the most learned</a>
<a id='line_27'>      civilians of Europe, Professor Warnkonig, published at Liege,</a>
<a id='line_28'>      1821. I have inserted almost the whole of these notes, which are</a>
<a id='line_29'>      distinguished by the letter W.—M. The vain titles of the</a>
<a id='line_30'>      victories of Justinian are crumbled into dust; but the name of</a>
<a id='line_31'>      the legislator is inscribed on a fair and everlasting monument.</a>
<a id='line_32'>      Under his reign, and by his care, the civil jurisprudence was</a>
<a id='line_33'>      digested in the immortal works of the Code, the Pandects, and the</a>
<a id='line_34'>      Institutes: 1 the public reason of the Romans has been silently</a>
<a id='line_35'>      or studiously transfused into the domestic institutions of</a>
<a id='line_36'>      Europe, 2, and the laws of Justinian still command the respect or</a>
<a id='line_37'>      obedience of independent nations. Wise or fortunate is the prince</a>
<a id='line_38'>      who connects his own reputation with the honor or interest of a</a>
<a id='line_39'>      perpetual order of men. The defence of their founder is the first</a>
<a id='line_40'>      cause, which in every age has exercised the zeal and industry of</a>
<a id='line_41'>      the civilians. They piously commemorate his virtues; dissemble or</a>
<a id='line_42'>      deny his failings; and fiercely chastise the guilt or folly of</a>
<a id='line_43'>      the rebels, who presume to sully the majesty of the purple. The</a>
<a id='line_44'>      idolatry of love has provoked, as it usually happens, the rancor</a>
<a id='line_45'>      of opposition; the character of Justinian has been exposed to the</a>
<a id='line_46'>      blind vehemence of flattery and invective; and the injustice of a</a>
<a id='line_47'>      sect (the Anti-Tribonians,) has refused all praise and merit to</a>
<a id='line_48'>      the prince, his ministers, and his laws. 3 Attached to no party,</a>
<a id='line_49'>      interested only for the truth and candor of history, and directed</a>
<a id='line_50'>      by the most temperate and skilful guides, 4 I enter with just</a>
<a id='line_51'>      diffidence on the subject of civil law, which has exhausted so</a>
<a id='line_52'>      many learned lives, and clothed the walls of such spacious</a>
<a id='line_53'>      libraries. In a single, if possible in a short, chapter, I shall</a>
<a id='line_54'>      trace the Roman jurisprudence from Romulus to Justinian, 5</a>
<a id='line_55'>      appreciate the labors of that emperor, and pause to contemplate</a>
<a id='line_56'>      the principles of a science so important to the peace and</a>
<a id='line_57'>      happiness of society. The laws of a nation form the most</a>
<a id='line_58'>      instructive portion of its history; and although I have devoted</a>
<a id='line_59'>      myself to write the annals of a declining monarchy, I shall</a>
<a id='line_60'>      embrace the occasion to breathe the pure and invigorating air of</a>
<a id='line_61'>      the republic.</a>

<a id='line_64'>      absurd and incomprehensible mode of quotation, which is supported</a>
<a id='line_65'>      by authority and custom. In their references to the Code, the</a>
<a id='line_66'>      Pandects, and the Institutes, they mention the number, not of the</a>
<a id='line_67'>      book, but only of the law; and content themselves with reciting</a>
<a id='line_68'>      the first words of the title to which it belongs; and of these</a>
<a id='line_69'>      titles there are more than a thousand. Ludewig (Vit. Justiniani,</a>
<a id='line_70'>      p. 268) wishes to shake off this pendantic yoke; and I have dared</a>
<a id='line_71'>      to adopt the simple and rational method of numbering the book,</a>
<a id='line_72'>      the title, and the law. Note: The example of Gibbon has been</a>
<a id='line_73'>      followed by M Hugo and other civilians.—M]</a>

<a id='line_76'>      have received them as common law or reason; in France, Italy,</a>
<a id='line_77'>      &c., they possess a direct or indirect influence; and they were</a>

<a id='line_81'>      and the legal historians of each country.) * Note: Although the</a>
<a id='line_82'>      restoration of the Roman law, introduced by the revival of this</a>
<a id='line_83'>      study in Italy, is one of the most important branches of history,</a>
<a id='line_84'>      it had been treated but imperfectly when Gibbon wrote his work.</a>
<a id='line_85'>      That of Arthur Duck is but an insignificant performance. But the</a>
<a id='line_86'>      researches of the learned have thrown much light upon the matter.</a>
<a id='line_87'>      The Sarti, the Tiraboschi, the Fantuzzi, the Savioli, had made</a>
<a id='line_88'>      some very interesting inquiries; but it was reserved for M. de</a>
<a id='line_89'>      Savigny, in a work entitled “The History of the Roman Law during</a>
<a id='line_90'>      the Middle Ages,” to cast the strongest right on this part of</a>
<a id='line_91'>      history. He demonstrates incontestably the preservation of the</a>
<a id='line_92'>      Roman law from Justinian to the time of the Glossators, who by</a>
<a id='line_93'>      their indefatigable zeal, propagated the study of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_94'>      jurisprudence in all the countries of Europe. It is much to be</a>
<a id='line_95'>      desired that the author should continue this interesting work,</a>
<a id='line_96'>      and that the learned should engage in the inquiry in what manner</a>
<a id='line_97'>      the Roman law introduced itself into their respective countries,</a>
<a id='line_98'>      and the authority which it progressively acquired. For Belgium,</a>
<a id='line_99'>      there exists, on this subject, (proposed by the Academy of</a>
<a id='line_100'>      Brussels in 1781,) a Collection of Memoirs, printed at Brussels</a>
<a id='line_101'>      in 4to., 1783, among which should be distinguished those of M. de</a>
<a id='line_102'>      Berg. M. Berriat Saint Prix has given us hopes of the speedy</a>

<a id='line_107'>      history of the Roman law in different parts of Europe. We cannot</a>
<a id='line_108'>      avoid mentioning an elementary work by M. Hugo, in which he</a>

<a id='line_122'>      place the learned and perspicuous Heineccius, a German professor,</a>

<a id='line_133'>      necessarily obliged to content himself with following the</a>
<a id='line_134'>      opinions of those writers who were then of the greatest</a>
<a id='line_135'>      authority; but as Heineccius, notwithstanding his high reputation</a>
<a id='line_136'>      for the study of the Roman law, knew nothing of the subject on</a>
<a id='line_137'>      which he treated, but what he had learned from the compilations</a>
<a id='line_138'>      of various authors, it happened that, in following the sometimes</a>
<a id='line_139'>      rash opinions of these guides, Gibbon has fallen into many</a>
<a id='line_140'>      errors, which we shall endeavor in succession to correct. The</a>
<a id='line_141'>      work of Bach on the History of the Roman Jurisprudence, with</a>
<a id='line_142'>      which Gibbon was not acquainted, is far superior to that of</a>

<a id='line_154'>      has been abridged, and probably corrupted, by Tribonian, and</a>

<a id='line_156'></a>
<a id='line_157'>      The primitive government of Rome 6 was composed, with some</a>
<a id='line_158'>      political skill, of an elective king, a council of nobles, and a</a>
<a id='line_159'>      general assembly of the people. War and religion were</a>
<a id='line_160'>      administered by the supreme magistrate; and he alone proposed the</a>
<a id='line_161'>      laws, which were debated in the senate, and finally ratified or</a>
<a id='line_162'>      rejected by a majority of votes in the thirty curiae or parishes</a>
<a id='line_163'>      of the city. Romulus, Numa, and Servius Tullius, are celebrated</a>
<a id='line_164'>      as the most ancient legislators; and each of them claims his</a>
<a id='line_165'>      peculiar part in the threefold division of jurisprudence. 7 The</a>
<a id='line_166'>      laws of marriage, the education of children, and the authority of</a>
<a id='line_167'>      parents, which may seem to draw their origin from nature itself,</a>
<a id='line_168'>      are ascribed to the untutored wisdom of Romulus. The law of</a>
<a id='line_169'>      nations and of religious worship, which Numa introduced, was</a>
<a id='line_170'>      derived from his nocturnal converse with the nymph Egeria. The</a>
<a id='line_171'>      civil law is attributed to the experience of Servius: he balanced</a>
<a id='line_172'>      the rights and fortunes of the seven classes of citizens; and</a>
<a id='line_173'>      guarded, by fifty new regulations, the observance of contracts</a>
<a id='line_174'>      and the punishment of crimes. The state, which he had inclined</a>
<a id='line_175'>      towards a democracy, was changed by the last Tarquin into a</a>
<a id='line_176'>      lawless despotism; and when the kingly office was abolished, the</a>
<a id='line_177'>      patricians engrossed the benefits of freedom. The royal laws</a>
<a id='line_178'>      became odious or obsolete; the mysterious deposit was silently</a>
<a id='line_179'>      preserved by the priests and nobles; and at the end of sixty</a>
<a id='line_180'>      years, the citizens of Rome still complained that they were ruled</a>
<a id='line_181'>      by the arbitrary sentence of the magistrates. Yet the positive</a>
<a id='line_182'>      institutions of the kings had blended themselves with the public</a>
<a id='line_183'>      and private manners of the city, some fragments of that venerable</a>
<a id='line_184'>      jurisprudence 8 were compiled by the diligence of antiquarians, 9</a>
<a id='line_185'>      and above twenty texts still speak the rudeness of the Pelasgic</a>

<a id='line_257'>      sullied by their actions the honor of inscribing on brass, or</a>
<a id='line_258'>      wood, or ivory, the Twelve Tables of the Roman laws. 12 They were</a>
<a id='line_259'>      dictated by the rigid and jealous spirit of an aristocracy, which</a>
<a id='line_260'>      had yielded with reluctance to the just demands of the people.</a>
<a id='line_261'>      But the substance of the Twelve Tables was adapted to the state</a>
<a id='line_262'>      of the city; and the Romans had emerged from Barbarism, since</a>
<a id='line_263'>      they were capable of studying and embracing the institutions of</a>
<a id='line_264'>      their more enlightened neighbors. 1211 A wise Ephesian was driven</a>
<a id='line_265'>      by envy from his native country: before he could reach the shores</a>
<a id='line_266'>      of Latium, he had observed the various forms of human nature and</a>
<a id='line_267'>      civil society: he imparted his knowledge to the legislators of</a>
<a id='line_268'>      Rome, and a statue was erected in the forum to the perpetual</a>
<a id='line_269'>      memory of Hermodorus. 13 The names and divisions of the copper</a>
<a id='line_270'>      money, the sole coin of the infant state, were of Dorian origin:</a>
<a id='line_271'>      14 the harvests of Campania and Sicily relieved the wants of a</a>
<a id='line_272'>      people whose agriculture was often interrupted by war and</a>
<a id='line_273'>      faction; and since the trade was established, 15 the deputies who</a>
<a id='line_274'>      sailed from the Tyber might return from the same harbors with a</a>
<a id='line_275'>      more precious cargo of political wisdom. The colonies of Great</a>
<a id='line_276'>      Greece had transported and improved the arts of their mother</a>
<a id='line_277'>      country. Cumae and Rhegium, Crotona and Tarentum, Agrigentum and</a>
<a id='line_278'>      Syracuse, were in the rank of the most flourishing cities. The</a>
<a id='line_279'>      disciples of Pythagoras applied philosophy to the use of</a>
<a id='line_280'>      government; the unwritten laws of Charondas accepted the aid of</a>
<a id='line_281'>      poetry and music, 16 and Zaleucus framed the republic of the</a>
<a id='line_282'>      Locrians, which stood without alteration above two hundred years.</a>
<a id='line_283'>      17 From a similar motive of national pride, both Livy and</a>
<a id='line_284'>      Dionysius are willing to believe, that the deputies of Rome</a>
<a id='line_285'>      visited Athens under the wise and splendid administration of</a>
<a id='line_286'>      Pericles; and the laws of Solon were transfused into the twelve</a>
<a id='line_287'>      tables. If such an embassy had indeed been received from the</a>
<a id='line_288'>      Barbarians of Hesperia, the Roman name would have been familiar</a>
<a id='line_289'>      to the Greeks before the reign of Alexander; 18 and the faintest</a>

<a id='line_488'>      The Decemvirs had been named, and their tables were approved, by</a>
<a id='line_489'>      an assembly of the centuries, in which riches preponderated</a>

<a id='line_491'>      one hundred thousand pounds of copper, 27 ninety-eight votes were</a>

<a id='line_508'>      of fear and shame, of honor and interest, and the abuse of</a>

<a id='line_625'>      defeat the plainest meaning of the Decemvirs, and where the end</a>
<a id='line_626'>      was salutary, the means were frequently absurd. The secret or</a>
<a id='line_627'>      probable wish of the dead was suffered to prevail over the order</a>
<a id='line_628'>      of succession and the forms of testaments; and the claimant, who</a>

<a id='line_632'>      compensations and fines were substituted to the obsolete rigor of</a>
<a id='line_633'>      the Twelve Tables; time and space were annihilated by fanciful</a>

<a id='line_688'>      praetorian edicts furnished the salutary means of perpetually</a>
<a id='line_689'>      harmonizing the legislation with the spirit of the times. The</a>
<a id='line_690'>      praetors were the true organs of public opinion. It was not</a>
<a id='line_691'>      according to their caprice that they framed their regulations,</a>
<a id='line_692'>      but according to the manners and to the opinions of the great</a>
<a id='line_693'>      civil lawyers of their day. We know from Cicero himself, that it</a>
<a id='line_694'>      was esteemed a great honor among the Romans to publish an edict,</a>
<a id='line_695'>      well conceived and well drawn. The most distinguished lawyers of</a>
<a id='line_696'>      Rome were invited by the praetor to assist in framing this annual</a>
<a id='line_697'>      law, which, according to its principle, was only a declaration</a>
<a id='line_698'>      which the praetor made to the public, to announce the manner in</a>
<a id='line_699'>      which he would judge, and to guard against every charge of</a>
<a id='line_700'>      partiality. Those who had reason to fear his opinions might delay</a>
<a id='line_701'>      their cause till the following year. The praetor was responsible</a>
<a id='line_702'>      for all the faults which he committed. The tribunes could lodge</a>
<a id='line_703'>      an accusation against the praetor who issued a partial edict. He</a>
<a id='line_704'>      was bound strictly to follow and to observe the regulations</a>
<a id='line_705'>      published by him at the commencement of his year of office,</a>

<a id='line_707'>      perpetual, and he could make no change in a regulation once</a>
<a id='line_708'>      published. The praetor was obliged to submit to his own edict,</a>
<a id='line_709'>      and to judge his own affairs according to its provisions. These</a>
<a id='line_710'>      magistrates had no power of departing from the fundamental laws,</a>
<a id='line_711'>      or the laws of the Twelve Tables. The people held them in such</a>
<a id='line_712'>      consideration, that they rarely enacted laws contrary to their</a>
<a id='line_713'>      provisions; but as some provisions were found inefficient, others</a>
<a id='line_714'>      opposed to the manners of the people, and to the spirit of</a>
<a id='line_715'>      subsequent ages, the praetors, still maintaining respect for the</a>
<a id='line_716'>      laws, endeavored to bring them into accordance with the</a>
<a id='line_717'>      necessities of the existing time, by such fictions as best suited</a>

<a id='line_789'>      passed over in silence so remarkable a change in the most</a>

<a id='line_791'>      that the various passages in authors, like Eutropius, are not</a>

<a id='line_797'>      must have noticed it, as he does l. i. 8, the responsa prudentum,</a>
<a id='line_798'>      on the occasion of a rescript of Hadrian. There is no lacuna in</a>
<a id='line_799'>      the text. Why then should Gaius maintain silence concerning an</a>
<a id='line_800'>      innovation so much more important than that of which he speaks?</a>
<a id='line_801'>      After all, this question becomes of slight interest, since, in</a>
<a id='line_802'>      fact, we find no change in the perpetual edict inserted in the</a>

<a id='line_817'>      From Augustus to Trajan, the modest Caesars were content to</a>
<a id='line_818'>      promulgate their edicts in the various characters of a Roman</a>
<a id='line_819'>      magistrate; 3511 and, in the decrees of the senate, the epistles</a>
<a id='line_820'>      and orations of the prince were respectfully inserted. Adrian 36</a>
<a id='line_821'>      appears to have been the first who assumed, without disguise, the</a>
<a id='line_822'>      plenitude of legislative power. And this innovation, so agreeable</a>
<a id='line_823'>      to his active mind, was countenanced by the patience of the</a>
<a id='line_824'>      times, and his long absence from the seat of government. The same</a>
<a id='line_825'>      policy was embraced by succeeding monarchs, and, according to the</a>
<a id='line_826'>      harsh metaphor of Tertullian, “the gloomy and intricate forest of</a>
<a id='line_827'>      ancient laws was cleared away by the axe of royal mandates and</a>
<a id='line_828'>      constitutions.” 37 During four centuries, from Adrian to</a>
<a id='line_829'>      Justinian the public and private jurisprudence was moulded by the</a>
<a id='line_830'>      will of the sovereign; and few institutions, either human or</a>
<a id='line_831'>      divine, were permitted to stand on their former basis. The origin</a>
<a id='line_832'>      of Imperial legislation was concealed by the darkness of ages and</a>
<a id='line_833'>      the terrors of armed despotism; and a double tiction was</a>
<a id='line_834'>      propagated by the servility, or perhaps the ignorance, of the</a>
<a id='line_835'>      civilians, who basked in the sunshine of the Roman and Byzantine</a>
<a id='line_836'>      courts. 1. To the prayer of the ancient Caesars, the people or</a>
<a id='line_837'>      the senate had sometimes granted a personal exemption from the</a>
<a id='line_838'>      obligation and penalty of particular statutes; and each</a>
<a id='line_839'>      indulgence was an act of jurisdiction exercised by the republic</a>
<a id='line_840'>      over the first of her citizens. His humble privilege was at</a>
<a id='line_841'>      length transformed into the prerogative of a tyrant; and the</a>
<a id='line_842'>      Latin expression of “released from the laws” 38 was supposed to</a>
<a id='line_843'>      exalt the emperor above all human restraints, and to leave his</a>
<a id='line_844'>      conscience and reason as the sacred measure of his conduct. 2. A</a>
<a id='line_845'>      similar dependence was implied in the decrees of the senate,</a>
<a id='line_846'>      which, in every reign, defined the titles and powers of an</a>
<a id='line_847'>      elective magistrate. But it was not before the ideas, and even</a>
<a id='line_848'>      the language, of the Romans had been corrupted, that a royal law,</a>
<a id='line_849'>      39 and an irrevocable gift of the people, were created by the</a>
<a id='line_850'>      fancy of Ulpian, or more probably of Tribonian himself; 40 and</a>
<a id='line_851'>      the origin of Imperial power, though false in fact, and slavish</a>
<a id='line_852'>      in its consequence, was supported on a principle of freedom and</a>
<a id='line_853'>      justice. “The pleasure of the emperor has the vigor and effect of</a>
<a id='line_854'>      law, since the Roman people, by the royal law, have transferred</a>
<a id='line_855'>      to their prince the full extent of their own power and</a>
<a id='line_856'>      sovereignty.” 41 The will of a single man, of a child perhaps,</a>
<a id='line_857'>      was allowed to prevail over the wisdom of ages and the</a>
<a id='line_858'>      inclinations of millions; and the degenerate Greeks were proud to</a>
<a id='line_859'>      declare, that in his hands alone the arbitrary exercise of</a>
<a id='line_860'>      legislation could be safely deposited. “What interest or</a>
<a id='line_861'>      passion,” exclaims Theophilus in the court of Justinian, “can</a>
<a id='line_862'>      reach the calm and sublime elevation of the monarch? He is</a>
<a id='line_863'>      already master of the lives and fortunes of his subjects; and</a>
<a id='line_864'>      those who have incurred his displeasure are already numbered with</a>
<a id='line_865'>      the dead.” 42 Disdaining the language of flattery, the historian</a>
<a id='line_866'>      may confess, that in questions of private jurisprudence, the</a>
<a id='line_867'>      absolute sovereign of a great empire can seldom be influenced by</a>
<a id='line_868'>      any personal considerations. Virtue, or even reason, will suggest</a>
<a id='line_869'>      to his impartial mind, that he is the guardian of peace and</a>
<a id='line_870'>      equity, and that the interest of society is inseparably connected</a>
<a id='line_871'>      with his own. Under the weakest and most vicious reign, the seat</a>
<a id='line_872'>      of justice was filled by the wisdom and integrity of Papinian and</a>
<a id='line_873'>      Ulpian; 43 and the purest materials of the Code and Pandects are</a>
<a id='line_874'>      inscribed with the names of Caracalla and his ministers. 44 The</a>
<a id='line_875'>      tyrant of Rome was sometimes the benefactor of the provinces. A</a>
<a id='line_876'>      dagger terminated the crimes of Domitian; but the prudence of</a>
<a id='line_877'>      Nerva confirmed his acts, which, in the joy of their deliverance,</a>
<a id='line_878'>      had been rescinded by an indignant senate. 45 Yet in the</a>
<a id='line_879'>      rescripts, 46 replies to the consultations of the magistrates,</a>
<a id='line_880'>      the wisest of princes might be deceived by a partial exposition</a>
<a id='line_881'>      of the case. And this abuse, which placed their hasty decisions</a>
<a id='line_882'>      on the same level with mature and deliberate acts of legislation,</a>
<a id='line_883'>      was ineffectually condemned by the sense and example of Trajan.</a>
<a id='line_884'>      The rescripts of the emperor, his grants and decrees, his edicts</a>
<a id='line_885'>      and pragmatic sanctions, were subscribed in purple ink, 47 and</a>
<a id='line_886'>      transmitted to the provinces as general or special laws, which</a>
<a id='line_887'>      the magistrates were bound to execute, and the people to obey.</a>
<a id='line_888'>      But as their number continually multiplied, the rule of obedience</a>
<a id='line_889'>      became each day more doubtful and obscure, till the will of the</a>
<a id='line_890'>      sovereign was fixed and ascertained in the Gregorian, the</a>
<a id='line_891'>      Hermogenian, and the Theodosian codes. 4711 The two first, of</a>
<a id='line_892'>      which some fragments have escaped, were framed by two private</a>
<a id='line_893'>      lawyers, to preserve the constitutions of the Pagan emperors from</a>
<a id='line_894'>      Adrian to Constantine. The third, which is still extant, was</a>
<a id='line_895'>      digested in sixteen books by the order of the younger Theodosius</a>
<a id='line_896'>      to consecrate the laws of the Christian princes from Constantine</a>
<a id='line_897'>      to his own reign. But the three codes obtained an equal authority</a>
<a id='line_898'>      in the tribunals; and any act which was not included in the</a>
<a id='line_899'>      sacred deposit might be disregarded by the judge as epurious or</a>

<a id='line_1146'>      was usefully employed to undermine the public institutions of</a>

<a id='line_1148'>      from the Twelve Tables to the reign of Justinian, may be divided</a>

<a id='line_1150'>      from each other by the mode of instruction and the character of</a>
<a id='line_1151'>      the civilians. 53 Pride and ignorance contributed, during the</a>
<a id='line_1152'>      first period, to confine within narrow limits the science of the</a>
<a id='line_1153'>      Roman law. On the public days of market or assembly, the masters</a>
<a id='line_1154'>      of the art were seen walking in the forum ready to impart the</a>
<a id='line_1155'>      needful advice to the meanest of their fellow-citizens, from</a>
<a id='line_1156'>      whose votes, on a future occasion, they might solicit a grateful</a>
<a id='line_1157'>      return. As their years and honors increased, they seated</a>
<a id='line_1158'>      themselves at home on a chair or throne, to expect with patient</a>
<a id='line_1159'>      gravity the visits of their clients, who at the dawn of day, from</a>
<a id='line_1160'>      the town and country, began to thunder at their door. The duties</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      of social life, and the incidents of judicial proceeding, were</a>
<a id='line_1162'>      the ordinary subject of these consultations, and the verbal or</a>
<a id='line_1163'>      written opinion of the juris-consults was framed according to the</a>
<a id='line_1164'>      rules of prudence and law. The youths of their own order and</a>
<a id='line_1165'>      family were permitted to listen; their children enjoyed the</a>
<a id='line_1166'>      benefit of more private lessons, and the Mucian race was long</a>
<a id='line_1167'>      renowned for the hereditary knowledge of the civil law. The</a>
<a id='line_1168'>      second period, the learned and splendid age of jurisprudence, may</a>
<a id='line_1169'>      be extended from the birth of Cicero to the reign of Severus</a>
<a id='line_1170'>      Alexander. A system was formed, schools were instituted, books</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      were composed, and both the living and the dead became</a>
<a id='line_1172'>      subservient to the instruction of the student. The tripartite of</a>
<a id='line_1173'>      Aelius Paetus, surnamed Catus, or the Cunning, was preserved as</a>
<a id='line_1174'>      the oldest work of Jurisprudence. Cato the censor derived some</a>
<a id='line_1175'>      additional fame from his legal studies, and those of his son: the</a>
<a id='line_1176'>      kindred appellation of Mucius Scaevola was illustrated by three</a>
<a id='line_1177'>      sages of the law; but the perfection of the science was ascribed</a>
<a id='line_1178'>      to Servius Sulpicius, their disciple, and the friend of Tully;</a>
<a id='line_1179'>      and the long succession, which shone with equal lustre under the</a>
<a id='line_1180'>      republic and under the Caesars, is finally closed by the</a>
<a id='line_1181'>      respectable characters of Papinian, of Paul, and of Ulpian. Their</a>
<a id='line_1182'>      names, and the various titles of their productions, have been</a>
<a id='line_1183'>      minutely preserved, and the example of Labeo may suggest some</a>
<a id='line_1184'>      idea of their diligence and fecundity. That eminent lawyer of the</a>
<a id='line_1185'>      Augustan age divided the year between the city and country,</a>
<a id='line_1186'>      between business and composition; and four hundred books are</a>
<a id='line_1187'>      enumerated as the fruit of his retirement. Of the collection of</a>
<a id='line_1188'>      his rival Capito, the two hundred and fifty-ninth book is</a>
<a id='line_1189'>      expressly quoted; and few teachers could deliver their opinions</a>
<a id='line_1190'>      in less than a century of volumes. In the third period, between</a>
<a id='line_1191'>      the reigns of Alexander and Justinian, the oracles of</a>
<a id='line_1192'>      jurisprudence were almost mute. The measure of curiosity had been</a>
<a id='line_1193'>      filled: the throne was occupied by tyrants and Barbarians, the</a>
<a id='line_1194'>      active spirits were diverted by religious disputes, and the</a>
<a id='line_1195'>      professors of Rome, Constantinople, and Berytus, were humbly</a>
<a id='line_1196'>      content to repeat the lessons of their more enlightened</a>
<a id='line_1197'>      predecessors. From the slow advances and rapid decay of these</a>
<a id='line_1198'>      legal studies, it may be inferred, that they require a state of</a>
<a id='line_1199'>      peace and refinement. From the multitude of voluminous civilians</a>

<a id='line_1403'>      respected, thus making a privilege of that which was free to all</a>
<a id='line_1404'>      the world. It appears to me almost indisputable, that the</a>
<a id='line_1405'>      emperors had sanctioned certain provisions relative to the</a>
<a id='line_1406'>      authority of these civilians, consulted by the judges. But how</a>
<a id='line_1407'>      far was their advice to be respected? This is a question which it</a>
<a id='line_1408'>      is impossible to answer precisely, from the want of historic</a>

<a id='line_1428'>      jurisprudence was divided by the once famous sects of the</a>
<a id='line_1429'>      Proculians and Sabinians. 62 Two sages of the law, Ateius Capito</a>
<a id='line_1430'>      and Antistius Labeo, 63 adorned the peace of the Augustan age;</a>
<a id='line_1431'>      the former distinguished by the favor of his sovereign; the</a>
<a id='line_1432'>      latter more illustrious by his contempt of that favor, and his</a>
<a id='line_1433'>      stern though harmless opposition to the tyrant of Rome. Their</a>
<a id='line_1434'>      legal studies were influenced by the various colors of their</a>
<a id='line_1435'>      temper and principles. Labeo was attached to the form of the old</a>
<a id='line_1436'>      republic; his rival embraced the more profitable substance of the</a>
<a id='line_1437'>      rising monarchy. But the disposition of a courtier is tame and</a>
<a id='line_1438'>      submissive; and Capito seldom presumed to deviate from the</a>
<a id='line_1439'>      sentiments, or at least from the words, of his predecessors;</a>
<a id='line_1440'>      while the bold republican pursued his independent ideas without</a>
<a id='line_1441'>      fear of paradox or innovations. The freedom of Labeo was</a>
<a id='line_1442'>      enslaved, however, by the rigor of his own conclusions, and he</a>
<a id='line_1443'>      decided, according to the letter of the law, the same questions</a>
<a id='line_1444'>      which his indulgent competitor resolved with a latitude of equity</a>
<a id='line_1445'>      more suitable to the common sense and feelings of mankind. If a</a>
<a id='line_1446'>      fair exchange had been substituted to the payment of money,</a>
<a id='line_1447'>      Capito still considered the transaction as a legal sale; 64 and</a>
<a id='line_1448'>      he consulted nature for the age of puberty, without confining his</a>
<a id='line_1449'>      definition to the precise period of twelve or fourteen years. 65</a>
<a id='line_1450'>      This opposition of sentiments was propagated in the writings and</a>

<a id='line_1453'>      that of Adrian; 66 and the two sects derived their appellations</a>
<a id='line_1454'>      from Sabinus and Proculus, their most celebrated teachers. The</a>
<a id='line_1455'>      names of Cassians and Pegasians were likewise applied to the same</a>
<a id='line_1456'>      parties; but, by a strange reverse, the popular cause was in the</a>
<a id='line_1457'>      hands of Pegasus, 67 a timid slave of Domitian, while the</a>
<a id='line_1458'>      favorite of the Caesars was represented by Cassius, 68 who</a>
<a id='line_1459'>      gloried in his descent from the patriot assassin. By the</a>
<a id='line_1460'>      perpetual edict, the controversies of the sects were in a great</a>
<a id='line_1461'>      measure determined. For that important work, the emperor Adrian</a>
<a id='line_1462'>      preferred the chief of the Sabinians: the friends of monarchy</a>
<a id='line_1463'>      prevailed; but the moderation of Salvius Julian insensibly</a>
<a id='line_1464'>      reconciled the victors and the vanquished. Like the contemporary</a>
<a id='line_1465'>      philosophers, the lawyers of the age of the Antonines disclaimed</a>
<a id='line_1466'>      the authority of a master, and adopted from every system the most</a>
<a id='line_1467'>      probable doctrines. 69 But their writings would have been less</a>
<a id='line_1468'>      voluminous, had their choice been more unanimous. The conscience</a>
<a id='line_1469'>      of the judge was perplexed by the number and weight of discordant</a>
<a id='line_1470'>      testimonies, and every sentence that his passion or interest</a>
<a id='line_1471'>      might pronounce was justified by the sanction of some venerable</a>
<a id='line_1472'>      name. An indulgent edict of the younger Theodosius excused him</a>
<a id='line_1473'>      from the labor of comparing and weighing their arguments. Five</a>
<a id='line_1474'>      civilians, Caius, Papinian, Paul, Ulpian, and Modestinus, were</a>
<a id='line_1475'>      established as the oracles of jurisprudence: a majority was</a>

<a id='line_1555'>      the new constitutions from Constantine to his own day; and to</a>

<a id='line_1561'>      as quaestor and praefectus, was president. A second commission of</a>

<a id='line_1590'></a>
<a id='line_1591'>      When Justinian ascended the throne, the reformation of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1592'>      jurisprudence was an arduous but indispensable task. In the space</a>
<a id='line_1593'>      of ten centuries, the infinite variety of laws and legal opinions</a>
<a id='line_1594'>      had filled many thousand volumes, which no fortune could purchase</a>
<a id='line_1595'>      and no capacity could digest. Books could not easily be found;</a>
<a id='line_1596'>      and the judges, poor in the midst of riches, were reduced to the</a>
<a id='line_1597'>      exercise of their illiterate discretion. The subjects of the</a>
<a id='line_1598'>      Greek provinces were ignorant of the language that disposed of</a>
<a id='line_1599'>      their lives and properties; and the barbarous dialect of the</a>
<a id='line_1600'>      Latins was imperfectly studied in the academies of Berytus and</a>
<a id='line_1601'>      Constantinople. As an Illyrian soldier, that idiom was familiar</a>
<a id='line_1602'>      to the infancy of Justinian; his youth had been instructed by the</a>
<a id='line_1603'>      lessons of jurisprudence, and his Imperial choice selected the</a>
<a id='line_1604'>      most learned civilians of the East, to labor with their sovereign</a>
<a id='line_1605'>      in the work of reformation. 71 The theory of professors was</a>
<a id='line_1606'>      assisted by the practice of advocates, and the experience of</a>
<a id='line_1607'>      magistrates; and the whole undertaking was animated by the spirit</a>
<a id='line_1608'>      of Tribonian. 72 This extraordinary man, the object of so much</a>
<a id='line_1609'>      praise and censure, was a native of Side in Pamphylia; and his</a>
<a id='line_1610'>      genius, like that of Bacon, embraced, as his own, all the</a>
<a id='line_1611'>      business and knowledge of the age. Tribonian composed, both in</a>
<a id='line_1612'>      prose and verse, on a strange diversity of curious and abstruse</a>
<a id='line_1613'>      subjects: 73 a double panegyric of Justinian and the life of the</a>
<a id='line_1614'>      philosopher Theodotus; the nature of happiness and the duties of</a>
<a id='line_1615'>      government; Homer’s catalogue and the four-and-twenty sorts of</a>
<a id='line_1616'>      metre; the astronomical canon of Ptolemy; the changes of the</a>
<a id='line_1617'>      months; the houses of the planets; and the harmonic system of the</a>
<a id='line_1618'>      world. To the literature of Greece he added the use of the Latin</a>
<a id='line_1619'>      tonque; the Roman civilians were deposited in his library and in</a>
<a id='line_1620'>      his mind; and he most assiduously cultivated those arts which</a>
<a id='line_1621'>      opened the road of wealth and preferment. From the bar of the</a>
<a id='line_1622'>      Praetorian praefects, he raised himself to the honors of</a>
<a id='line_1623'>      quaestor, of consul, and of master of the offices: the council of</a>
<a id='line_1624'>      Justinian listened to his eloquence and wisdom; and envy was</a>
<a id='line_1625'>      mitigated by the gentleness and affability of his manners. The</a>
<a id='line_1626'>      reproaches of impiety and avarice have stained the virtue or the</a>
<a id='line_1627'>      reputation of Tribonian. In a bigoted and persecuting court, the</a>
<a id='line_1628'>      principal minister was accused of a secret aversion to the</a>
<a id='line_1629'>      Christian faith, and was supposed to entertain the sentiments of</a>
<a id='line_1630'>      an Atheist and a Pagan, which have been imputed, inconsistently</a>
<a id='line_1631'>      enough, to the last philosophers of Greece. His avarice was more</a>
<a id='line_1632'>      clearly proved and more sensibly felt. If he were swayed by gifts</a>
<a id='line_1633'>      in the administration of justice, the example of Bacon will again</a>
<a id='line_1634'>      occur; nor can the merit of Tribonian atone for his baseness, if</a>
<a id='line_1635'>      he degraded the sanctity of his profession; and if laws were</a>
<a id='line_1636'>      every day enacted, modified, or repealed, for the base</a>
<a id='line_1637'>      consideration of his private emolument. In the sedition of</a>
<a id='line_1638'>      Constantinople, his removal was granted to the clamors, perhaps</a>
<a id='line_1639'>      to the just indignation, of the people: but the quaestor was</a>
<a id='line_1640'>      speedily restored, and, till the hour of his death, he possessed,</a>
<a id='line_1641'>      above twenty years, the favor and confidence of the emperor. His</a>
<a id='line_1642'>      passive and dutiful submission had been honored with the praise</a>
<a id='line_1643'>      of Justinian himself, whose vanity was incapable of discerning</a>
<a id='line_1644'>      how often that submission degenerated into the grossest</a>
<a id='line_1645'>      adulation. Tribonian adored the virtues of his gracious of his</a>
<a id='line_1646'>      gracious master; the earth was unworthy of such a prince; and he</a>
<a id='line_1647'>      affected a pious fear, that Justinian, like Elijah or Romulus,</a>
<a id='line_1648'>      would be snatched into the air, and translated alive to the</a>

<a id='line_1688'>      afraid to establish his private judgment as the standard of</a>
<a id='line_1689'>      equity: in the possession of legislative power, he borrowed the</a>
<a id='line_1690'>      aid of time and opinion; and his laborious compilations are</a>
<a id='line_1691'>      guarded by the sages and legislature of past times. Instead of a</a>
<a id='line_1692'>      statue cast in a simple mould by the hand of an artist, the works</a>
<a id='line_1693'>      of Justinian represent a tessellated pavement of antique and</a>
<a id='line_1694'>      costly, but too often of incoherent, fragments. In the first year</a>
<a id='line_1695'>      of his reign, he directed the faithful Tribonian, and nine</a>
<a id='line_1696'>      learned associates, to revise the ordinances of his predecessors,</a>
<a id='line_1697'>      as they were contained, since the time of Adrian, in the</a>
<a id='line_1698'>      Gregorian Hermogenian, and Theodosian codes; to purge the errors</a>
<a id='line_1699'>      and contradictions, to retrench whatever was obsolete or</a>
<a id='line_1700'>      superfluous, and to select the wise and salutary laws best</a>
<a id='line_1701'>      adapted to the practice of the tribunals and the use of his</a>
<a id='line_1702'>      subjects. The work was accomplished in fourteen months; and the</a>
<a id='line_1703'>      twelve books or tables, which the new decemvirs produced, might</a>
<a id='line_1704'>      be designed to imitate the labors of their Roman predecessors.</a>
<a id='line_1705'>      The new Code of Justinian was honored with his name, and</a>
<a id='line_1706'>      confirmed by his royal signature: authentic transcripts were</a>
<a id='line_1707'>      multiplied by the pens of notaries and scribes; they were</a>
<a id='line_1708'>      transmitted to the magistrates of the European, the Asiatic, and</a>
<a id='line_1709'>      afterwards the African provinces; and the law of the empire was</a>
<a id='line_1710'>      proclaimed on solemn festivals at the doors of churches. A more</a>
<a id='line_1711'>      arduous operation was still behind—to extract the spirit of</a>
<a id='line_1712'>      jurisprudence from the decisions and conjectures, the questions</a>
<a id='line_1713'>      and disputes, of the Roman civilians. Seventeen lawyers, with</a>
<a id='line_1714'>      Tribonian at their head, were appointed by the emperor to</a>
<a id='line_1715'>      exercise an absolute jurisdiction over the works of their</a>
<a id='line_1716'>      predecessors. If they had obeyed his commands in ten years,</a>
<a id='line_1717'>      Justinian would have been satisfied with their diligence; and the</a>
<a id='line_1718'>      rapid composition of the Digest of Pandects, 75 in three years,</a>
<a id='line_1719'>      will deserve praise or censure, according to the merit of the</a>
<a id='line_1720'>      execution. From the library of Tribonian, they chose forty, the</a>
<a id='line_1721'>      most eminent civilians of former times: 76 two thousand treatises</a>
<a id='line_1722'>      were comprised in an abridgment of fifty books; and it has been</a>
<a id='line_1723'>      carefully recorded, that three millions of lines or sentences, 77</a>
<a id='line_1724'>      were reduced, in this abstract, to the moderate number of one</a>
<a id='line_1725'>      hundred and fifty thousand. The edition of this great work was</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      delayed a month after that of the Institutes; and it seemed</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      reasonable that the elements should precede the digest of the</a>
<a id='line_1728'>      Roman law. As soon as the emperor had approved their labors, he</a>
<a id='line_1729'>      ratified, by his legislative power, the speculations of these</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      private citizens: their commentaries, on the twelve tables, the</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      perpetual edict, the laws of the people, and the decrees of the</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      senate, succeeded to the authority of the text; and the text was</a>

<a id='line_1786'>      Justinian (it has been fiercely urged) was fearful of</a>

<a id='line_1788'></a>
<a id='line_1789'>      Tribonian condemned to oblivion the genuine and native wisdom of</a>

<a id='line_1792'>      flocked to the Imperial court to study Latin as a foreign tongue,</a>
<a id='line_1793'>      and jurisprudence as a lucrative profession. But the ministers of</a>
<a id='line_1794'>      Justinian, 78 were instructed to labor, not for the curiosity of</a>
<a id='line_1795'>      antiquarians, but for the immediate benefit of his subjects. It</a>
<a id='line_1796'>      was their duty to select the useful and practical parts of the</a>
<a id='line_1797'>      Roman law; and the writings of the old republicans, however</a>
<a id='line_1798'>      curious or excellent, were no longer suited to the new system of</a>
<a id='line_1799'>      manners, religion, and government. Perhaps, if the preceptors and</a>
<a id='line_1800'>      friends of Cicero were still alive, our candor would acknowledge,</a>
<a id='line_1801'>      that, except in purity of language, 79 their intrinsic merit was</a>
<a id='line_1802'>      excelled by the school of Papinian and Ulpian. The science of the</a>
<a id='line_1803'>      laws is the slow growth of time and experience, and the advantage</a>
<a id='line_1804'>      both of method and materials, is naturally assumed by the most</a>
<a id='line_1805'>      recent authors. The civilians of the reign of the Antonines had</a>
<a id='line_1806'>      studied the works of their predecessors: their philosophic spirit</a>
<a id='line_1807'>      had mitigated the rigor of antiquity, simplified the forms of</a>
<a id='line_1808'>      proceeding, and emerged from the jealousy and prejudice of the</a>
<a id='line_1809'>      rival sects. The choice of the authorities that compose the</a>
<a id='line_1810'>      Pandects depended on the judgment of Tribonian: but the power of</a>
<a id='line_1811'>      his sovereign could not absolve him from the sacred obligations</a>
<a id='line_1812'>      of truth and fidelity. As the legislator of the empire, Justinian</a>

<a id='line_2117'>      gradually abolished, and the reason or instinct of Justinian</a>

<a id='line_2123'>      indulgence communicated some rays of their glory to the persons</a>

<a id='line_2125'>      citizens were equal, and all subjects of the empire were citizens</a>
<a id='line_2126'>      of Rome. That inestimable character was degraded to an obsolete</a>
<a id='line_2127'>      and empty name. The voice of a Roman could no longer enact his</a>
<a id='line_2128'>      laws, or create the annual ministers of his power: his</a>
<a id='line_2129'>      constitutional rights might have checked the arbitrary will of a</a>
<a id='line_2130'>      master: and the bold adventurer from Germany or Arabia was</a>

<a id='line_2132'>      which the citizen alone had been once entitled to assume over the</a>
<a id='line_2133'>      conquests of his fathers. The first Caesars had scrupulously</a>
<a id='line_2134'>      guarded the distinction of ingenuous and servile birth, which was</a>
<a id='line_2135'>      decided by the condition of the mother; and the candor of the</a>
<a id='line_2136'>      laws was satisfied, if her freedom could be ascertained, during a</a>
<a id='line_2137'>      single moment, between the conception and the delivery. The</a>
<a id='line_2138'>      slaves, who were liberated by a generous master, immediately</a>
<a id='line_2139'>      entered into the middle class of libertines or freedmen; but they</a>
<a id='line_2140'>      could never be enfranchised from the duties of obedience and</a>
<a id='line_2141'>      gratitude; whatever were the fruits of their industry, their</a>
<a id='line_2142'>      patron and his family inherited the third part; or even the whole</a>
<a id='line_2143'>      of their fortune, if they died without children and without a</a>
<a id='line_2144'>      testament. Justinian respected the rights of patrons; but his</a>
<a id='line_2145'>      indulgence removed the badge of disgrace from the two inferior</a>
<a id='line_2146'>      orders of freedmen; whoever ceased to be a slave, obtained,</a>
<a id='line_2147'>      without reserve or delay, the station of a citizen; and at length</a>
<a id='line_2148'>      the dignity of an ingenuous birth, which nature had refused, was</a>

<a id='line_2153'>      the spirit of his laws promoted the extinction of domestic</a>

<a id='line_2221'>      alienated freedom: the son was again restored to his unnatural</a>

<a id='line_2321'>      liberal profession, the salary of public service, and the sacred</a>
<a id='line_2322'>      liberality of the emperor or empress. The life of a citizen was</a>
<a id='line_2323'>      less exposed than his fortune to the abuse of paternal power. Yet</a>
<a id='line_2324'>      his life might be adverse to the interest or passions of an</a>

<a id='line_2328'>      by the emperor from the just fury of the multitude. 109 The Roman</a>
<a id='line_2329'>      father, from the license of servile dominion, was reduced to the</a>
<a id='line_2330'>      gravity and moderation of a judge. The presence and opinion of</a>
<a id='line_2331'>      Augustus confirmed the sentence of exile pronounced against an</a>
<a id='line_2332'>      intentional parricide by the domestic tribunal of Arius. Adrian</a>
<a id='line_2333'>      transported to an island the jealous parent, who, like a robber,</a>
<a id='line_2334'>      had seized the opportunity of hunting, to assassinate a youth,</a>
<a id='line_2335'>      the incestuous lover of his step-mother. 110 A private</a>
<a id='line_2336'>      jurisdiction is repugnant to the spirit of monarchy; the parent</a>
<a id='line_2337'>      was again reduced from a judge to an accuser; and the magistrates</a>
<a id='line_2338'>      were enjoined by Severus Alexander to hear his complaints and</a>
<a id='line_2339'>      execute his sentence. He could no longer take the life of a son</a>
<a id='line_2340'>      without incurring the guilt and punishment of murder; and the</a>
<a id='line_2341'>      pains of parricide, from which he had been excepted by the</a>
<a id='line_2342'>      Pompeian law, were finally inflicted by the justice of</a>
<a id='line_2343'>      Constantine. 111 The same protection was due to every period of</a>
<a id='line_2344'>      existence; and reason must applaud the humanity of Paulus, for</a>
<a id='line_2345'>      imputing the crime of murder to the father who strangles, or</a>
<a id='line_2346'>      starves, or abandons his new-born infant; or exposes him in a</a>
<a id='line_2347'>      public place to find the mercy which he himself had denied. But</a>
<a id='line_2348'>      the exposition of children was the prevailing and stubborn vice</a>

<a id='line_2353'>      a popular custom which was palliated by the motives of economy</a>
<a id='line_2354'>      and compassion. 112 If the father could subdue his own feelings,</a>

<a id='line_2534'>      might sell his children, and his wife was reckoned in the number</a>
<a id='line_2535'>      of his children: the domestic judge might pronounce the death of</a>
<a id='line_2536'>      the offender, or his mercy might expel her from his bed and</a>
<a id='line_2537'>      house; but the slavery of the wretched female was hopeless and</a>
<a id='line_2538'>      perpetual, unless he asserted for his own convenience the manly</a>
<a id='line_2539'>      prerogative of divorce. 1231 The warmest applause has been</a>
<a id='line_2540'>      lavished on the virtue of the Romans, who abstained from the</a>
<a id='line_2541'>      exercise of this tempting privilege above five hundred years: 124</a>
<a id='line_2542'>      but the same fact evinces the unequal terms of a connection in</a>
<a id='line_2543'>      which the slave was unable to renounce her tyrant, and the tyrant</a>
<a id='line_2544'>      was unwilling to relinquish his slave. When the Roman matrons</a>
<a id='line_2545'>      became the equal and voluntary companions of their lords, a new</a>
<a id='line_2546'>      jurisprudence was introduced, that marriage, like other</a>
<a id='line_2547'>      partnerships, might be dissolved by the abdication of one of the</a>
<a id='line_2548'>      associates. In three centuries of prosperity and corruption, this</a>
<a id='line_2549'>      principle was enlarged to frequent practice and pernicious abuse.</a>
<a id='line_2550'></a>
<a id='line_2551'>      Passion, interest, or caprice, suggested daily motives for the</a>
<a id='line_2552'>      dissolution of marriage; a word, a sign, a message, a letter, the</a>

<a id='line_2554'>      of human connections was degraded to a transient society of</a>
<a id='line_2555'>      profit or pleasure. According to the various conditions of life,</a>
<a id='line_2556'>      both sexes alternately felt the disgrace and injury: an</a>
<a id='line_2557'>      inconstant spouse transferred her wealth to a new family,</a>
<a id='line_2558'>      abandoning a numerous, perhaps a spurious, progeny to the</a>
<a id='line_2559'>      paternal authority and care of her late husband; a beautiful</a>

<a id='line_2638'>      was stripped of her wealth and ornaments, without excepting the</a>

<a id='line_2821'>      jurisprudence has pronounced, that the charge of tutelage should</a>

<a id='line_2833'>      authority was finally determined by the age of puberty. Without</a>
<a id='line_2834'>      his consent, no act of the pupil could bind himself to his own</a>
<a id='line_2835'>      prejudice, though it might oblige others for his personal</a>
<a id='line_2836'>      benefit. It is needless to observe, that the tutor often gave</a>
<a id='line_2837'>      security, and always rendered an account, and that the want of</a>
<a id='line_2838'>      diligence or integrity exposed him to a civil and almost criminal</a>

<a id='line_2891'>      the exercise of similar diligence. Such, in truth, may be the</a>

<a id='line_2895'>      engrossed by the bold and crafty; each field and forest is</a>
<a id='line_2896'>      circumscribed by the landmarks of a jealous master; and it is the</a>
<a id='line_2897'>      peculiar praise of the Roman jurisprudence, that i asserts the</a>
<a id='line_2898'>      claim of the first occupant to the wild animals of the earth, the</a>
<a id='line_2899'>      air, and the waters. In the progress from primitive equity to</a>
<a id='line_2900'>      final injustice, the steps are silent, the shades are almost</a>
<a id='line_2901'>      imperceptible, and the absolute monopoly is guarded by positive</a>
<a id='line_2902'>      laws and artificial reason. The active, insatiate principle of</a>
<a id='line_2903'>      self-love can alone supply the arts of life and the wages of</a>
<a id='line_2904'>      industry; and as soon as civil government and exclusive property</a>
<a id='line_2905'>      have been introduced, they become necessary to the existence of</a>
<a id='line_2906'>      the human race. Except in the singular institutions of Sparta,</a>
<a id='line_2907'>      the wisest legislators have disapproved an agrarian law as a</a>
<a id='line_2908'>      false and dangerous innovation. Among the Romans, the enormous</a>
<a id='line_2909'>      disproportion of wealth surmounted the ideal restraints of a</a>
<a id='line_2910'>      doubtful tradition, and an obsolete statute; a tradition that the</a>
<a id='line_2911'>      poorest follower of Romulus had been endowed with the perpetual</a>
<a id='line_2912'>      inheritance of two jugera; 138 a statute which confined the</a>
<a id='line_2913'>      richest citizen to the measure of five hundred jugera, or three</a>
<a id='line_2914'>      hundred and twelve acres of land. The original territory of Rome</a>
<a id='line_2915'>      consisted only of some miles of wood and meadow along the banks</a>
<a id='line_2916'>      of the Tyber; and domestic exchange could add nothing to the</a>
<a id='line_2917'>      national stock. But the goods of an alien or enemy were lawfully</a>
<a id='line_2918'>      exposed to the first hostile occupier; the city was enriched by</a>
<a id='line_2919'>      the profitable trade of war; and the blood of her sons was the</a>
<a id='line_2920'>      only price that was paid for the Volscian sheep, the slaves of</a>
<a id='line_2921'>      Briton, or the gems and gold of Asiatic kingdoms. In the language</a>
<a id='line_2922'>      of ancient jurisprudence, which was corrupted and forgotten</a>
<a id='line_2923'>      before the age of Justinian, these spoils were distinguished by</a>
<a id='line_2924'>      the name of manceps or manicipium, taken with the hand; and</a>
<a id='line_2925'>      whenever they were sold or emancipated, the purchaser required</a>
<a id='line_2926'>      some assurance that they had been the property of an enemy, and</a>
<a id='line_2927'>      not of a fellow-citizen. 139 A citizen could only forfeit his</a>
<a id='line_2928'>      rights by apparent dereliction, and such dereliction of a</a>
<a id='line_2929'>      valuable interest could not easily be presumed. Yet, according to</a>
<a id='line_2930'>      the Twelve Tables, a prescription of one year for movables, and</a>
<a id='line_2931'>      of two years for immovables, abolished the claim of the ancient</a>
<a id='line_2932'>      master, if the actual possessor had acquired them by a fair</a>
<a id='line_2933'>      transaction from the person whom he believed to be the lawful</a>
<a id='line_2934'>      proprietor. 140 Such conscientious injustice, without any mixture</a>
<a id='line_2935'>      of fraud or force could seldom injure the members of a small</a>
<a id='line_2936'>      republic; but the various periods of three, of ten, or of twenty</a>
<a id='line_2937'>      years, determined by Justinian, are more suitable to the latitude</a>
<a id='line_2938'>      of a great empire. It is only in the term of prescription that</a>
<a id='line_2939'>      the distinction of real and personal fortune has been remarked by</a>
<a id='line_2940'>      the civilians; and their general idea of property is that of</a>
<a id='line_2941'>      simple, uniform, and absolute dominion. The subordinate</a>

<a id='line_2983'>      ancient law, and as it has been demonstrated, recognized, and</a>
<a id='line_2984'>      adopted by the most learned expositors of the Roman law. Besides</a>

<a id='line_2987'>      the Institutes of Gaius, i. 54, and ii. 40, et seq. The Roman</a>
<a id='line_2988'>      laws protected all property acquired in a lawful manner. They</a>
<a id='line_2989'>      imposed on those who had invaded it, the obligation of making</a>
<a id='line_2990'>      restitution and reparation of all damage caused by that invasion;</a>
<a id='line_2991'>      they punished it moreover, in many cases, by a pecuniary fine.</a>
<a id='line_2992'>      But they did not always grant a recovery against the third</a>
<a id='line_2993'>      person, who had become bona fide possessed of the property. He</a>
<a id='line_2994'>      who had obtained possession of a thing belonging to another,</a>
<a id='line_2995'>      knowing nothing of the prior rights of that person, maintained</a>
<a id='line_2996'>      the possession. The law had expressly determined those cases, in</a>
<a id='line_2997'>      which it permitted property to be reclaimed from an innocent</a>
<a id='line_2998'>      possessor. In these cases possession had the characters of</a>
<a id='line_2999'>      absolute proprietorship, called mancipium, jus Quiritium. To</a>
<a id='line_3000'>      possess this right, it was not sufficient to have entered into</a>
<a id='line_3001'>      possession of the thing in any manner; the acquisition was bound</a>
<a id='line_3002'>      to have that character of publicity, which was given by the</a>
<a id='line_3003'>      observation of solemn forms, prescribed by the laws, or the</a>
<a id='line_3004'>      uninterrupted exercise of proprietorship during a certain time:</a>
<a id='line_3005'>      the Roman citizen alone could acquire this proprietorship. Every</a>
<a id='line_3006'>      other kind of possession, which might be named imperfect</a>
<a id='line_3007'>      proprietorship, was called “in bonis habere.” It was not till</a>
<a id='line_3008'>      after the time of Cicero that the general name of Dominium was</a>
<a id='line_3009'>      given to all proprietorship. It was then the publicity which</a>
<a id='line_3010'>      constituted the distinctive character of absolute dominion. This</a>
<a id='line_3011'>      publicity was grounded on the mode of acquisition, which the</a>
<a id='line_3012'>      moderns have called Civil, (Modi adquirendi Civiles.) These modes</a>
<a id='line_3013'>      of acquisition were, 1. Mancipium or mancipatio, which was</a>
<a id='line_3014'>      nothing but the solemn delivering over of the thing in the</a>
<a id='line_3015'>      presence of a determinate number of witnesses and a public</a>
<a id='line_3016'>      officer; it was from this probably that proprietorship was named,</a>
<a id='line_3017'>      2. In jure cessio, which was a solemn delivering over before the</a>
<a id='line_3018'>      praetor. 3. Adjudicatio, made by a judge, in a case of partition.</a>
<a id='line_3019'>      4. Lex, which comprehended modes of acquiring in particular cases</a>
<a id='line_3020'>      determined by law; probably the law of the xii. tables; for</a>
<a id='line_3021'>      instance, the sub corona emptio and the legatum. 5. Usna, called</a>
<a id='line_3022'>      afterwards usacapio, and by the moderns prescription. This was</a>
<a id='line_3023'>      only a year for movables; two years for things not movable. Its</a>
<a id='line_3024'>      primary object was altogether different from that of prescription</a>
<a id='line_3025'>      in the present day. It was originally introduced in order to</a>
<a id='line_3026'>      transform the simple possession of a thing (in bonis habere) into</a>
<a id='line_3027'>      Roman proprietorship. The public and uninterrupted possession of</a>
<a id='line_3028'>      a thing, enjoyed for the space of one or two years, was</a>
<a id='line_3029'>      sufficient to make known to the inhabitants of the city of Rome</a>
<a id='line_3030'>      to whom the thing belonged. This last mode of acquisition</a>
<a id='line_3031'>      completed the system of civil acquisitions. by legalizing. as it</a>
<a id='line_3032'>      were, every other kind of acquisition which was not conferred,</a>
<a id='line_3033'>      from the commencement, by the Jus Quiritium. V. Ulpian. Fragm. i.</a>
<a id='line_3034'>      16. Gaius, ii. 14. We believe, according to Gaius, 43, that this</a>
<a id='line_3035'>      usucaption was extended to the case where a thing had been</a>
<a id='line_3036'>      acquired from a person not the real proprietor; and that</a>
<a id='line_3037'>      according to the time prescribed, it gave to the possessor the</a>
<a id='line_3038'>      Roman proprietorship. But this does not appear to have been the</a>
<a id='line_3039'>      original design of this Institution. Caeterum etiam earum rerum</a>
<a id='line_3040'>      usucapio nobis competit, quae non a domino nobis tradita fuerint,</a>
<a id='line_3041'>      si modo eas bona fide acceperimus Gaius, l ii. 43. As to things</a>
<a id='line_3042'>      of smaller value, or those which it was difficult to distinguish</a>
<a id='line_3043'>      from each other, the solemnities of which we speak were not</a>
<a id='line_3044'>      requisite to obtain legal proprietorship. In this case simple</a>
<a id='line_3045'>      delivery was sufficient. In proportion to the aggrandizement of</a>
<a id='line_3046'>      the Republic, this latter principle became more important from</a>
<a id='line_3047'>      the increase of the commerce and wealth of the state. It was</a>
<a id='line_3048'>      necessary to know what were those things of which absolute</a>
<a id='line_3049'>      property might be acquired by simple delivery, and what, on the</a>
<a id='line_3050'>      contrary, those, the acquisition of which must be sanctioned by</a>
<a id='line_3051'>      these solemnities. This question was necessarily to be decided by</a>
<a id='line_3052'>      a general rule; and it is this rule which establishes the</a>
<a id='line_3053'>      distinction between res mancipi and nec mancipi, a distinction</a>
<a id='line_3054'>      about which the opinions of modern civilians differ so much that</a>
<a id='line_3055'>      there are above ten conflicting systems on the subject. The</a>
<a id='line_3056'>      system which accords best with a sound interpretation of the</a>
<a id='line_3057'>      Roman laws, is that proposed by M. Trekel of Hamburg, and still</a>
<a id='line_3058'>      further developed by M. Hugo, who has extracted it in the</a>
<a id='line_3059'>      Magazine of Civil Law, vol. ii. p. 7. This is the system now</a>
<a id='line_3060'>      almost universally adopted. Res mancipi (by contraction for</a>
<a id='line_3061'>      mancipii) were things of which the absolute property (Jus</a>
<a id='line_3062'>      Quiritium) might be acquired only by the solemnities mentioned</a>
<a id='line_3063'>      above, at least by that of mancipation, which was, without doubt,</a>
<a id='line_3064'>      the most easy and the most usual. Gaius, ii. 25. As for other</a>
<a id='line_3065'>      things, the acquisition of which was not subject to these forms,</a>
<a id='line_3066'>      in order to confer absolute right, they were called res nec</a>
<a id='line_3067'>      mancipi. See Ulpian, Fragm. xix. 1. 3, 7. Ulpian and Varro</a>
<a id='line_3068'>      enumerate the different kinds of res mancipi. Their enumerations</a>
<a id='line_3069'>      do not quite agree; and various methods of reconciling them have</a>
<a id='line_3070'>      been attempted. The authority of Ulpian, however, who wrote as a</a>
<a id='line_3071'>      civilian, ought to have the greater weight on this subject. But</a>
<a id='line_3072'>      why are these things alone res mancipi? This is one of the</a>
<a id='line_3073'>      questions which have been most frequently agitated, and on which</a>
<a id='line_3074'>      the opinions of civilians are most divided. M. Hugo has resolved</a>
<a id='line_3075'>      it in the most natural and satisfactory manner. “All things which</a>
<a id='line_3076'>      were easily known individually, which were of great value, with</a>
<a id='line_3077'>      which the Romans were acquainted, and which they highly</a>
<a id='line_3078'>      appreciated, were res mancipi. Of old mancipation or some other</a>
<a id='line_3079'>      solemn form was required for the acquisition of these things, an</a>
<a id='line_3080'>      account of their importance. Mancipation served to prove their</a>
<a id='line_3081'>      acquisition, because they were easily distinguished one from the</a>
<a id='line_3082'>      other.” On this great historical discussion consult the Magazine</a>
<a id='line_3083'>      of Civil Law by M. Hugo, vol. ii. p. 37, 38; the dissertation of</a>
<a id='line_3084'>      M. J. M. Zachariae, de Rebus Mancipi et nec Mancipi Conjecturae,</a>

<a id='line_3086'>      Institutiones Juris Romani Privati p. 108, 110. As a general</a>
<a id='line_3087'>      rule, it may be said that all things are res nec mancipi; the res</a>
<a id='line_3088'>      mancipi are the exception to this principle. The praetors changed</a>
<a id='line_3089'>      the system of property by allowing a person, who had a thing in</a>
<a id='line_3090'>      bonis, the right to recover before the prescribed term of</a>
<a id='line_3091'>      usucaption had conferred absolute proprietorship. (Pauliana in</a>
<a id='line_3092'>      rem actio.) Justinian went still further, in times when there was</a>
<a id='line_3093'>      no longer any distinction between a Roman citizen and a stranger.</a>
<a id='line_3094'>      He granted the right of recovering all things which had been</a>

<a id='line_3126'>      unless they were already freed from his paternal power, were</a>

<a id='line_3128'>      prerogative of primogeniture was unknown; the two sexes were</a>
<a id='line_3129'>      placed on a just level; all the sons and daughters were entitled</a>
<a id='line_3130'>      to an equal portion of the patrimonial estate; and if any of the</a>
<a id='line_3131'>      sons had been intercepted by a premature death, his person was</a>
<a id='line_3132'>      represented, and his share was divided, by his surviving</a>
<a id='line_3133'>      children. On the failure of the direct line, the right of</a>
<a id='line_3134'>      succession must diverge to the collateral branches. The degrees</a>
<a id='line_3135'>      of kindred 146 are numbered by the civilians, ascending from the</a>
<a id='line_3136'>      last possessor to a common parent, and descending from the common</a>

<a id='line_3139'>      remainder of the series may be conceived by a fancy, or pictured</a>
<a id='line_3140'>      in a genealogical table. In this computation, a distinction was</a>
<a id='line_3141'>      made, essential to the laws and even the constitution of Rome;</a>
<a id='line_3142'>      the agnats, or persons connected by a line of males, were called,</a>
<a id='line_3143'>      as they stood in the nearest degree, to an equal partition; but a</a>
<a id='line_3144'>      female was incapable of transmitting any legal claims; and the</a>
<a id='line_3145'>      cognats of every rank, without excepting the dear relation of a</a>
<a id='line_3146'>      mother and a son, were disinherited by the Twelve Tables, as</a>
<a id='line_3147'>      strangers and aliens. Among the Romans agens or lineage was</a>
<a id='line_3148'>      united by a common name and domestic rites; the various cognomens</a>
<a id='line_3149'>      or surnames of Scipio, or Marcellus, distinguished from each</a>
<a id='line_3150'>      other the subordinate branches or families of the Cornelian or</a>
<a id='line_3151'>      Claudian race: the default of the agnats, of the same surname,</a>
<a id='line_3152'>      was supplied by the larger denomination of gentiles; and the</a>
<a id='line_3153'>      vigilance of the laws maintained, in the same name, the perpetual</a>
<a id='line_3154'>      descent of religion and property. A similar principle dictated</a>
<a id='line_3155'>      the Voconian law, 147 which abolished the right of female</a>
<a id='line_3156'>      inheritance. As long as virgins were given or sold in marriage,</a>
<a id='line_3157'>      the adoption of the wife extinguished the hopes of the daughter.</a>
<a id='line_3158'>      But the equal succession of independent matrons supported their</a>

<a id='line_3232'>      to the assembly of the thirty curiae or parishes, and the general</a>
<a id='line_3233'>      law of inheritance was suspended by an occasional act of the</a>

<a id='line_3239'>      purchaser; and the estate was emancipated by a fictitious sale</a>

<a id='line_3241'>      the wonder of the Greeks, was still practised in the age of</a>
<a id='line_3242'>      Severus; but the praetors had already approved a more simple</a>
<a id='line_3243'>      testament, for which they required the seals and signatures of</a>
<a id='line_3244'>      seven witnesses, free from all legal exception, and purposely</a>

<a id='line_3246'>      monarch, who reigned over the lives and fortunes of his children,</a>
<a id='line_3247'>      might distribute their respective shares according to the degrees</a>
<a id='line_3248'>      of their merit or his affection; his arbitrary displeasure</a>
<a id='line_3249'>      chastised an unworthy son by the loss of his inheritance, and the</a>
<a id='line_3250'>      mortifying preference of a stranger. But the experience of</a>
<a id='line_3251'>      unnatural parents recommended some limitations of their</a>
<a id='line_3252'>      testamentary powers. A son, or, by the laws of Justinian, even a</a>
<a id='line_3253'>      daughter, could no longer be disinherited by their silence: they</a>
<a id='line_3254'>      were compelled to name the criminal, and to specify the offence;</a>
<a id='line_3255'>      and the justice of the emperor enumerated the sole causes that</a>
<a id='line_3256'>      could justify such a violation of the first principles of nature</a>
<a id='line_3257'>      and society. 153 Unless a legitimate portion, a fourth part, had</a>
<a id='line_3258'>      been reserved for the children, they were entitled to institute</a>
<a id='line_3259'>      an action or complaint of inofficious testament; to suppose that</a>
<a id='line_3260'>      their father’s understanding was impaired by sickness or age; and</a>
<a id='line_3261'>      respectfully to appeal from his rigorous sentence to the</a>
<a id='line_3262'>      deliberate wisdom of the magistrate. In the Roman jurisprudence,</a>
<a id='line_3263'>      an essential distinction was admitted between the inheritance and</a>
<a id='line_3264'>      the legacies. The heirs who succeeded to the entire unity, or to</a>
<a id='line_3265'>      any of the twelve fractions of the substance of the testator,</a>
<a id='line_3266'>      represented his civil and religious character, asserted his</a>
<a id='line_3267'>      rights, fulfilled his obligations, and discharged the gifts of</a>
<a id='line_3268'>      friendship or liberality, which his last will had bequeathed</a>
<a id='line_3269'>      under the name of legacies. But as the imprudence or prodigality</a>
<a id='line_3270'>      of a dying man might exhaust the inheritance, and leave only risk</a>
<a id='line_3271'>      and labor to his successor, he was empowered to retain the</a>
<a id='line_3272'>      Falcidian portion; to deduct, before the payment of the legacies,</a>
<a id='line_3273'>      a clear fourth for his own emolument. A reasonable time was</a>
<a id='line_3274'>      allowed to examine the proportion between the debts and the</a>
<a id='line_3275'>      estate, to decide whether he should accept or refuse the</a>
<a id='line_3276'>      testament; and if he used the benefit of an inventory, the</a>
<a id='line_3277'>      demands of the creditors could not exceed the valuation of the</a>
<a id='line_3278'>      effects. The last will of a citizen might be altered during his</a>
<a id='line_3279'>      life, or rescinded after his death: the persons whom he named</a>
<a id='line_3280'>      might die before him, or reject the inheritance, or be exposed to</a>
<a id='line_3281'>      some legal disqualification. In the contemplation of these</a>
<a id='line_3282'>      events, he was permitted to substitute second and third heirs, to</a>

<a id='line_3284'>      the incapacity of a madman or an infant to bequeath his property</a>
<a id='line_3285'>      might be supplied by a similar substitution. 154 But the power of</a>
<a id='line_3286'>      the testator expired with the acceptance of the testament: each</a>
<a id='line_3287'>      Roman of mature age and discretion acquired the absolute dominion</a>

<a id='line_3342'>      an only daughter was condemned almost as an alien in her father’s</a>

<a id='line_3351'>      of every virtuous mind. The declaration of Augustus relieved</a>

<a id='line_3404'>      to the rigid maxims of the patricians and decemvirs, a naked</a>
<a id='line_3405'>      pact, a promise, or even an oath, did not create any civil</a>
<a id='line_3406'>      obligation, unless it was confirmed by the legal form of a</a>
<a id='line_3407'>      stipulation. Whatever might be the etymology of the Latin word,</a>

<a id='line_3453'>      the benefit is compensated by an equivalent, and the obligation</a>
<a id='line_3454'>      to restore is variously modified by the nature of the</a>
<a id='line_3455'>      transaction. The Latin language very happily expresses the</a>
<a id='line_3456'>      fundamental difference between the commodatum and the mutuum,</a>
<a id='line_3457'>      which our poverty is reduced to confound under the vague and</a>
<a id='line_3458'>      common appellation of a loan. In the former, the borrower was</a>
<a id='line_3459'>      obliged to restore the same individual thing with which he had</a>
<a id='line_3460'>      been accommodated for the temporary supply of his wants; in the</a>
<a id='line_3461'>      latter, it was destined for his use and consumption, and he</a>
<a id='line_3462'>      discharged this mutual engagement, by substituting the same</a>
<a id='line_3463'>      specific value according to a just estimation of number, of</a>
<a id='line_3464'>      weight, and of measure. In the contract of sale, the absolute</a>
<a id='line_3465'>      dominion is transferred to the purchaser, and he repays the</a>
<a id='line_3466'>      benefit with an adequate sum of gold or silver, the price and</a>
<a id='line_3467'>      universal standard of all earthly possessions. The obligation of</a>
<a id='line_3468'>      another contract, that of location, is of a more complicated</a>
<a id='line_3469'>      kind. Lands or houses, labor or talents, may be hired for a</a>
<a id='line_3470'>      definite term; at the expiration of the time, the thing itself</a>
<a id='line_3471'>      must be restored to the owner, with an additional reward for the</a>
<a id='line_3472'>      beneficial occupation and employment. In these lucrative</a>
<a id='line_3473'>      contracts, to which may be added those of partnership and</a>
<a id='line_3474'>      commissions, the civilians sometimes imagine the delivery of the</a>
<a id='line_3475'>      object, and sometimes presume the consent of the parties. The</a>
<a id='line_3476'>      substantial pledge has been refined into the invisible rights of</a>
<a id='line_3477'>      a mortgage or hypotheca; and the agreement of sale, for a certain</a>
<a id='line_3478'>      price, imputes, from that moment, the chances of gain or loss to</a>
<a id='line_3479'>      the account of the purchaser. It may be fairly supposed, that</a>
<a id='line_3480'>      every man will obey the dictates of his interest; and if he</a>
<a id='line_3481'>      accepts the benefit, he is obliged to sustain the expense, of the</a>
<a id='line_3482'>      transaction. In this boundless subject, the historian will</a>
<a id='line_3483'>      observe the location of land and money, the rent of the one and</a>
<a id='line_3484'>      the interest of the other, as they materially affect the</a>
<a id='line_3485'>      prosperity of agriculture and commerce. The landlord was often</a>
<a id='line_3486'>      obliged to advance the stock and instruments of husbandry, and to</a>
<a id='line_3487'>      content himself with a partition of the fruits. If the feeble</a>
<a id='line_3488'>      tenant was oppressed by accident, contagion, or hostile violence,</a>
<a id='line_3489'>      he claimed a proportionable relief from the equity of the laws:</a>
<a id='line_3490'>      five years were the customary term, and no solid or costly</a>
<a id='line_3491'>      improvements could be expected from a farmer, who, at each moment</a>

<a id='line_3689'>      8. The nocturnal mischief of damaging or destroying a neighbor’s</a>

<a id='line_3703'>      1781 After the judicial proof or confession of the debt, thirty</a>
<a id='line_3704'>      days of grace were allowed before a Roman was delivered into the</a>
<a id='line_3705'>      power of his fellow-citizen. In this private prison, twelve</a>
<a id='line_3706'>      ounces of rice were his daily food; he might be bound with a</a>
<a id='line_3707'>      chain of fifteen pounds weight; and his misery was thrice exposed</a>
<a id='line_3708'>      in the market place, to solicit the compassion of his friends and</a>
<a id='line_3709'>      countrymen. At the expiration of sixty days, the debt was</a>
<a id='line_3710'>      discharged by the loss of liberty or life; the insolvent debtor</a>
<a id='line_3711'>      was either put to death, or sold in foreign slavery beyond the</a>
<a id='line_3712'>      Tyber: but, if several creditors were alike obstinate and</a>
<a id='line_3713'>      unrelenting, they might legally dismember his body, and satiate</a>
<a id='line_3714'>      their revenge by this horrid partition. The advocates for this</a>
<a id='line_3715'>      savage law have insisted, that it must strongly operate in</a>
<a id='line_3716'>      deterring idleness and fraud from contracting debts which they</a>
<a id='line_3717'>      were unable to discharge; but experience would dissipate this</a>
<a id='line_3718'>      salutary terror, by proving that no creditor could be found to</a>
<a id='line_3719'>      exact this unprofitable penalty of life or limb. As the manners</a>
<a id='line_3720'>      of Rome were insensibly polished, the criminal code of the</a>
<a id='line_3721'>      decemvirs was abolished by the humanity of accusers, witnesses,</a>
<a id='line_3722'>      and judges; and impunity became the consequence of immoderate</a>
<a id='line_3723'>      rigor. The Porcian and Valerian laws prohibited the magistrates</a>
<a id='line_3724'>      from inflicting on a free citizen any capital, or even corporal,</a>
<a id='line_3725'>      punishment; and the obsolete statutes of blood were artfully, and</a>

<a id='line_3959'>      the laws: and the guilty parties, after the payment of heavy</a>

<a id='line_3965'>      simple or double adultery, so familiar and so important in the</a>

<a id='line_3968'>      a more odious vice, of which modesty rejects the name, and nature</a>

<a id='line_3973'>      extorted by an act of violence, was insensibly abolished by the</a>
<a id='line_3974'>      lapse of time and the multitude of criminals. By this law, the</a>
<a id='line_3975'>      rape, perhaps the seduction, of an ingenuous youth, was</a>
<a id='line_3976'>      compensated, as a personal injury, by the poor damages of ten</a>

<a id='line_3982'>      the severity of opinion: the indelible stain of manhood was</a>
<a id='line_3983'>      confounded with the more venial transgressions of fornication and</a>

<a id='line_4044'>      A new spirit of legislation, respectable even in its error, arose</a>
<a id='line_4045'>      in the empire with the religion of Constantine. 197 The laws of</a>
<a id='line_4046'>      Moses were received as the divine original of justice, and the</a>
<a id='line_4047'>      Christian princes adapted their penal statutes to the degrees of</a>
<a id='line_4048'>      moral and religious turpitude. Adultery was first declared to be</a>
<a id='line_4049'>      a capital offence: the frailty of the sexes was assimilated to</a>
<a id='line_4050'>      poison or assassination, to sorcery or parricide; the same</a>
<a id='line_4051'>      penalties were inflicted on the passive and active guilt of</a>
<a id='line_4052'>      paederasty; and all criminals of free or servile condition were</a>
<a id='line_4053'>      either drowned or beheaded, or cast alive into the avenging</a>
<a id='line_4054'>      flames. The adulterers were spared by the common sympathy of</a>
<a id='line_4055'>      mankind; but the lovers of their own sex were pursued by general</a>
<a id='line_4056'>      and pious indignation: the impure manners of Greece still</a>
<a id='line_4057'>      prevailed in the cities of Asia, and every vice was fomented by</a>
<a id='line_4058'>      the celibacy of the monks and clergy. Justinian relaxed the</a>
<a id='line_4059'>      punishment at least of female infidelity: the guilty spouse was</a>
<a id='line_4060'>      only condemned to solitude and penance, and at the end of two</a>
<a id='line_4061'>      years she might be recalled to the arms of a forgiving husband.</a>
<a id='line_4062'>      But the same emperor declared himself the implacable enemy of</a>
<a id='line_4063'>      unmanly lust, and the cruelty of his persecution can scarcely be</a>
<a id='line_4064'>      excused by the purity of his motives. 198 In defiance of every</a>
<a id='line_4065'>      principle of justice, he stretched to past as well as future</a>
<a id='line_4066'>      offences the operations of his edicts, with the previous</a>
<a id='line_4067'>      allowance of a short respite for confession and pardon. A painful</a>
<a id='line_4068'>      death was inflicted by the amputation of the sinful instrument,</a>
<a id='line_4069'>      or the insertion of sharp reeds into the pores and tubes of most</a>
<a id='line_4070'>      exquisite sensibility; and Justinian defended the propriety of</a>
<a id='line_4071'>      the execution, since the criminals would have lost their hands,</a>
<a id='line_4072'>      had they been convicted of sacrilege. In this state of disgrace</a>
<a id='line_4073'>      and agony, two bishops, Isaiah of Rhodes and Alexander of</a>
<a id='line_4074'>      Diospolis, were dragged through the streets of Constantinople,</a>
<a id='line_4075'>      while their brethren were admonished, by the voice of a crier, to</a>
<a id='line_4076'>      observe this awful lesson, and not to pollute the sanctity of</a>
<a id='line_4077'>      their character. Perhaps these prelates were innocent. A sentence</a>
<a id='line_4078'>      of death and infamy was often founded on the slight and</a>
<a id='line_4079'>      suspicious evidence of a child or a servant: the guilt of the</a>
<a id='line_4080'>      green faction, of the rich, and of the enemies of Theodora, was</a>

<a id='line_4120'>      201 1. The administration of justice is the most ancient office</a>
<a id='line_4121'>      of a prince: it was exercised by the Roman kings, and abused by</a>
<a id='line_4122'>      Tarquin; who alone, without law or council, pronounced his</a>
<a id='line_4123'>      arbitrary judgments. The first consuls succeeded to this regal</a>

<a id='line_4125'>      jurisdiction of the magistrates, and all public causes were</a>

<a id='line_4127'>      democracy, superior to the forms, too often disdains the</a>

<a id='line_4130'>      sometimes applaud the happiness of the Persian, whose fate</a>

<a id='line_4133'>      once the cause and effect of the gravity and temperance of the</a>
<a id='line_4134'>      Romans. The right of accusation was confined to the magistrates.</a>
<a id='line_4135'></a>
<a id='line_4136'>      A vote of the thirty five tribes could inflict a fine; but the</a>
<a id='line_4137'>      cognizance of all capital crimes was reserved by a fundamental</a>
<a id='line_4138'>      law to the assembly of the centuries, in which the weight of</a>
<a id='line_4139'>      influence and property was sure to preponderate. Repeated</a>
<a id='line_4140'>      proclamations and adjournments were interposed, to allow time for</a>
<a id='line_4141'>      prejudice and resentment to subside: the whole proceeding might</a>
<a id='line_4142'>      be annulled by a seasonable omen, or the opposition of a tribune;</a>
<a id='line_4143'>      and such popular trials were commonly less formidable to</a>
<a id='line_4144'>      innocence than they were favorable to guilt. But this union of</a>
<a id='line_4145'>      the judicial and legislative powers left it doubtful whether the</a>
<a id='line_4146'>      accused party was pardoned or acquitted; and, in the defence of</a>

<a id='line_4150'>      citizens for the trial of each offender became more difficult, as</a>
<a id='line_4151'>      the citizens and the offenders continually multiplied; and the</a>
<a id='line_4152'>      ready expedient was adopted of delegating the jurisdiction of the</a>
<a id='line_4153'>      people to the ordinary magistrates, or to extraordinary</a>
<a id='line_4154'>      inquisitors. In the first ages these questions were rare and</a>
<a id='line_4155'>      occasional. In the beginning of the seventh century of Rome they</a>
<a id='line_4156'>      were made perpetual: four praetors were annually empowered to sit</a>
<a id='line_4157'>      in judgment on the state offences of treason, extortion,</a>
<a id='line_4158'>      peculation, and bribery; and Sylla added new praetors and new</a>
<a id='line_4159'>      questions for those crimes which more directly injure the safety</a>
<a id='line_4160'>      of individuals. By these inquisitors the trial was prepared and</a>
<a id='line_4161'>      directed; but they could only pronounce the sentence of the</a>
<a id='line_4162'>      majority of judges, who with some truth, and more prejudice, have</a>
<a id='line_4163'>      been compared to the English juries. 202 To discharge this</a>
<a id='line_4164'>      important, though burdensome office, an annual list of ancient</a>
<a id='line_4165'>      and respectable citizens was formed by the praetor. After many</a>
<a id='line_4166'>      constitutional struggles, they were chosen in equal numbers from</a>
<a id='line_4167'>      the senate, the equestrian order, and the people; four hundred</a>
<a id='line_4168'>      and fifty were appointed for single questions; and the various</a>
<a id='line_4169'>      rolls or decuries of judges must have contained the names of some</a>
<a id='line_4170'>      thousand Romans, who represented the judicial authority of the</a>
<a id='line_4171'>      state. In each particular cause, a sufficient number was drawn</a>
<a id='line_4172'>      from the urn; their integrity was guarded by an oath; the mode of</a>
<a id='line_4173'>      ballot secured their independence; the suspicion of partiality</a>
<a id='line_4174'>      was removed by the mutual challenges of the accuser and</a>
<a id='line_4175'>      defendant; and the judges of Milo, by the retrenchment of fifteen</a>
<a id='line_4176'>      on each side, were reduced to fifty-one voices or tablets, of</a>
<a id='line_4177'>      acquittal, of condemnation, or of favorable doubt. 203 3. In his</a>
<a id='line_4178'>      civil jurisdiction, the praetor of the city was truly a judge,</a>
<a id='line_4179'>      and almost a legislator; but, as soon as he had prescribed the</a>
<a id='line_4180'>      action of law, he often referred to a delegate the determination</a>
<a id='line_4181'>      of the fact. With the increase of legal proceedings, the tribunal</a>
<a id='line_4182'>      of the centumvirs, in which he presided, acquired more weight and</a>
<a id='line_4183'>      reputation. But whether he acted alone, or with the advice of his</a>
<a id='line_4184'>      council, the most absolute powers might be trusted to a</a>

<a id='line_4308'>      the laudable desire of conciliating ancient names with recent</a>
<a id='line_4309'>      institutions destroyed the harmony, and swelled the magnitude, of</a>
<a id='line_4310'>      the obscure and irregular system. The laws which excuse, on any</a>
<a id='line_4311'>      occasions, the ignorance of their subjects, confess their own</a>
<a id='line_4312'>      imperfections: the civil jurisprudence, as it was abridged by</a>
<a id='line_4313'>      Justinian, still continued a mysterious science, and a profitable</a>
<a id='line_4314'>      trade, and the innate perplexity of the study was involved in</a>

<a id='line_4316'>      The expense of the pursuit sometimes exceeded the value of the</a>
<a id='line_4317'>      prize, and the fairest rights were abandoned by the poverty or</a>

<a id='line_4319'>      abate the spirit of litigation, but the unequal pressure serves</a>
<a id='line_4320'>      only to increase the influence of the rich, and to aggravate the</a>

<a id='line_4322'>      the wealthy pleader obtains a more certain advantage than he</a>
