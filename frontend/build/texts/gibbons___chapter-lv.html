<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>      Under the reign of Constantine the grandson of Heraclius, the</a>
<a id='line_9'>      ancient barrier of the Danube, so often violated and so often</a>
<a id='line_10'>      restored, was irretrievably swept away by a new deluge of</a>
<a id='line_11'>      Barbarians. Their progress was favored by the caliphs, their</a>
<a id='line_12'>      unknown and accidental auxiliaries: the Roman legions were</a>
<a id='line_13'>      occupied in Asia; and after the loss of Syria, Egypt, and Africa,</a>
<a id='line_14'>      the Caesars were twice reduced to the danger and disgrace of</a>
<a id='line_15'>      defending their capital against the Saracens. If, in the account</a>
<a id='line_16'>      of this interesting people, I have deviated from the strict and</a>
<a id='line_17'>      original line of my undertaking, the merit of the subject will</a>
<a id='line_18'>      hide my transgression, or solicit my excuse. In the East, in the</a>
<a id='line_19'>      West, in war, in religion, in science, in their prosperity, and</a>
<a id='line_20'>      in their decay, the Arabians press themselves on our curiosity:</a>
<a id='line_21'>      the first overthrow of the church and empire of the Greeks may be</a>
<a id='line_22'>      imputed to their arms; and the disciples of Mahomet still hold</a>
<a id='line_23'>      the civil and religious sceptre of the Oriental world. But the</a>
<a id='line_24'>      same labor would be unworthily bestowed on the swarms of savages,</a>
<a id='line_25'>      who, between the seventh and the twelfth century, descended from</a>
<a id='line_26'>      the plains of Scythia, in transient inroad or perpetual</a>
<a id='line_27'>      emigration. 1 Their names are uncouth, their origins doubtful,</a>
<a id='line_28'>      their actions obscure, their superstition was blind, their valor</a>
<a id='line_29'>      brutal, and the uniformity of their public and private lives was</a>
<a id='line_30'>      neither softened by innocence nor refined by policy. The majesty</a>
<a id='line_31'>      of the Byzantine throne repelled and survived their disorderly</a>
<a id='line_32'>      attacks; the greater part of these Barbarians has disappeared</a>
<a id='line_33'>      without leaving any memorial of their existence, and the</a>
<a id='line_34'>      despicable remnant continues, and may long continue, to groan</a>
<a id='line_35'>      under the dominion of a foreign tyrant. From the antiquities of,</a>
<a id='line_36'>      I. Bulgarians, II. Hungarians, and, III. Russians, I shall</a>
<a id='line_37'>      content myself with selecting such facts as yet deserve to be</a>
<a id='line_38'>      remembered. The conquests of the, IV. Normans, and the monarchy</a>
<a id='line_39'>      of the, V. Turks, will naturally terminate in the memorable</a>
<a id='line_40'>      Crusades to the Holy Land, and the double fall of the city and</a>
<a id='line_41'>      empire of Constantine.</a>

<a id='line_44'>      relate to the Barbarians are compiled, methodized, and</a>

<a id='line_52'>      I. In his march to Italy, Theodoric 2 the Ostrogoth had trampled</a>
<a id='line_53'>      on the arms of the Bulgarians. After this defeat, the name and</a>
<a id='line_54'>      the nation are lost during a century and a half; and it may be</a>
<a id='line_55'>      suspected that the same or a similar appellation was revived by</a>
<a id='line_56'>      strange colonies from the Borysthenes, the Tanais, or the Volga.</a>
<a id='line_57'>      A king of the ancient Bulgaria, 3 bequeathed to his five sons a</a>
<a id='line_58'>      last lesson of moderation and concord. It was received as youth</a>
<a id='line_59'>      has ever received the counsels of age and experience: the five</a>
<a id='line_60'>      princes buried their father; divided his subjects and cattle;</a>
<a id='line_61'>      forgot his advice; separated from each other; and wandered in</a>
<a id='line_62'>      quest of fortune till we find the most adventurous in the heart</a>
<a id='line_63'>      of Italy, under the protection of the exarch of Ravenna. 4 But</a>
<a id='line_64'>      the stream of emigration was directed or impelled towards the</a>
<a id='line_65'>      capital. The modern Bulgaria, along the southern banks of the</a>
<a id='line_66'>      Danube, was stamped with the name and image which it has retained</a>
<a id='line_67'>      to the present hour: the new conquerors successively acquired, by</a>
<a id='line_68'>      war or treaty, the Roman provinces of Dardania, Thessaly, and the</a>
<a id='line_69'>      two Epirus; 5 the ecclesiastical supremacy was translated from</a>
<a id='line_70'>      the native city of Justinian; and, in their prosperous age, the</a>
<a id='line_71'>      obscure town of Lychnidus, or Achrida, was honored with the</a>
<a id='line_72'>      throne of a king and a patriarch. 6 The unquestionable evidence</a>
<a id='line_73'>      of language attests the descent of the Bulgarians from the</a>
<a id='line_74'>      original stock of the Sclavonian, or more properly Slavonian,</a>
<a id='line_75'>      race; 7 and the kindred bands of Servians, Bosnians, Rascians,</a>
<a id='line_76'>      Croatians, Walachians, 8 &c., followed either the standard or the</a>
<a id='line_77'>      example of the leading tribe. From the Euxine to the Adriatic, in</a>
<a id='line_78'>      the state of captives, or subjects, or allies, or enemies, of the</a>
<a id='line_79'>      Greek empire, they overspread the land; and the national</a>
<a id='line_80'>      appellation of the slaves 9 has been degraded by chance or malice</a>
<a id='line_81'>      from the signification of glory to that of servitude. 10 Among</a>
<a id='line_82'>      these colonies, the Chrobatians, 11 or Croats, who now attend the</a>
<a id='line_83'>      motions of an Austrian army, are the descendants of a mighty</a>
<a id='line_84'>      people, the conquerors and sovereigns of Dalmatia. The maritime</a>
<a id='line_85'>      cities, and of these the infant republic of Ragusa, implored the</a>
<a id='line_86'>      aid and instructions of the Byzantine court: they were advised by</a>
<a id='line_87'>      the magnanimous Basil to reserve a small acknowledgment of their</a>
<a id='line_88'>      fidelity to the Roman empire, and to appease, by an annual</a>
<a id='line_89'>      tribute, the wrath of these irresistible Barbarians. The kingdom</a>
<a id='line_90'>      of Crotia was shared by eleven Zoupans, or feudatory lords; and</a>
<a id='line_91'>      their united forces were numbered at sixty thousand horse and one</a>
<a id='line_92'>      hundred thousand foot. A long sea-coast, indented with capacious</a>
<a id='line_93'>      harbors, covered with a string of islands, and almost in sight of</a>
<a id='line_94'>      the Italian shores, disposed both the natives and strangers to</a>
<a id='line_95'>      the practice of navigation. The boats or brigantines of the</a>
<a id='line_96'>      Croats were constructed after the fashion of the old Liburnians:</a>
<a id='line_97'>      one hundred and eighty vessels may excite the idea of a</a>
<a id='line_98'>      respectable navy; but our seamen will smile at the allowance of</a>
<a id='line_99'>      ten, or twenty, or forty, men for each of these ships of war.</a>
<a id='line_100'>      They were gradually converted to the more honorable service of</a>
<a id='line_101'>      commerce; yet the Sclavonian pirates were still frequent and</a>
<a id='line_102'>      dangerous; and it was not before the close of the tenth century</a>
<a id='line_103'>      that the freedom and sovereignty of the Gulf were effectually</a>
<a id='line_104'>      vindicated by the Venetian republic. 12 The ancestors of these</a>
<a id='line_105'>      Dalmatian kings were equally removed from the use and abuse of</a>
<a id='line_106'>      navigation: they dwelt in the White Croatia, in the inland</a>
<a id='line_107'>      regions of Silesia and Little Poland, thirty days’ journey,</a>

<a id='line_188'>      The glory of the Bulgarians 13 was confined to a narrow scope</a>
<a id='line_189'>      both of time and place. In the ninth and tenth centuries, they</a>
<a id='line_190'>      reigned to the south of the Danube; but the more powerful nations</a>
<a id='line_191'>      that had followed their emigration repelled all return to the</a>
<a id='line_192'>      north and all progress to the west. Yet in the obscure catalogue</a>
<a id='line_193'>      of their exploits, they might boast an honor which had hitherto</a>
<a id='line_194'>      been appropriated to the Goths: that of slaying in battle one of</a>
<a id='line_195'>      the successors of Augustus and Constantine. The emperor</a>
<a id='line_196'>      Nicephorus had lost his fame in the Arabian, he lost his life in</a>
<a id='line_197'>      the Sclavonian, war. In his first operations he advanced with</a>
<a id='line_198'>      boldness and success into the centre of Bulgaria, and burnt the</a>
<a id='line_199'>      royal court, which was probably no more than an edifice and</a>
<a id='line_200'>      village of timber. But while he searched the spoil and refused</a>
<a id='line_201'>      all offers of treaty, his enemies collected their spirits and</a>
<a id='line_202'>      their forces: the passes of retreat were insuperably barred; and</a>
<a id='line_203'>      the trembling Nicephorus was heard to exclaim, “Alas, alas!</a>
<a id='line_204'>      unless we could assume the wings of birds, we cannot hope to</a>
<a id='line_205'>      escape.” Two days he waited his fate in the inactivity of</a>
<a id='line_206'>      despair; but, on the morning of the third, the Bulgarians</a>
<a id='line_207'>      surprised the camp, and the Roman prince, with the great officers</a>
<a id='line_208'>      of the empire, were slaughtered in their tents. The body of</a>
<a id='line_209'>      Valens had been saved from insult; but the head of Nicephorus was</a>
<a id='line_210'>      exposed on a spear, and his skull, enchased with gold, was often</a>
<a id='line_211'>      replenished in the feasts of victory. The Greeks bewailed the</a>
<a id='line_212'>      dishonor of the throne; but they acknowledged the just punishment</a>
<a id='line_213'>      of avarice and cruelty. This savage cup was deeply tinctured with</a>
<a id='line_214'>      the manners of the Scythian wilderness; but they were softened</a>
<a id='line_215'>      before the end of the same century by a peaceful intercourse with</a>
<a id='line_216'>      the Greeks, the possession of a cultivated region, and the</a>
<a id='line_217'>      introduction of the Christian worship. The nobles of Bulgaria</a>
<a id='line_218'>      were educated in the schools and palace of Constantinople; and</a>
<a id='line_219'>      Simeon, 14 a youth of the royal line, was instructed in the</a>
<a id='line_220'>      rhetoric of Demosthenes and the logic of Aristotle. He</a>
<a id='line_221'>      relinquished the profession of a monk for that of a king and</a>
<a id='line_222'>      warrior; and in his reign of more than forty years, Bulgaria</a>
<a id='line_223'>      assumed a rank among the civilized powers of the earth. The</a>
<a id='line_224'>      Greeks, whom he repeatedly attacked, derived a faint consolation</a>
<a id='line_225'>      from indulging themselves in the reproaches of perfidy and</a>
<a id='line_226'>      sacrilege. They purchased the aid of the Pagan Turks; but Simeon,</a>
<a id='line_227'>      in a second battle, redeemed the loss of the first, at a time</a>
<a id='line_228'>      when it was esteemed a victory to elude the arms of that</a>
<a id='line_229'>      formidable nation. The Servians were overthrown, made captive and</a>
<a id='line_230'>      dispersed; and those who visited the country before their</a>
<a id='line_231'>      restoration could discover no more than fifty vagrants, without</a>
<a id='line_232'>      women or children, who extorted a precarious subsistence from the</a>
<a id='line_233'>      chase. On classic ground, on the banks of Achelous, the greeks</a>
<a id='line_234'>      were defeated; their horn was broken by the strength of the</a>
<a id='line_235'>      Barbaric Hercules. 15 He formed the siege of Constantinople; and,</a>
<a id='line_236'>      in a personal conference with the emperor, Simeon imposed the</a>
<a id='line_237'>      conditions of peace. They met with the most jealous precautions:</a>
<a id='line_238'>      the royal gallery was drawn close to an artificial and</a>
<a id='line_239'>      well-fortified platform; and the majesty of the purple was</a>
<a id='line_240'>      emulated by the pomp of the Bulgarian. “Are you a Christian?”</a>
<a id='line_241'>      said the humble Romanus: “it is your duty to abstain from the</a>
<a id='line_242'>      blood of your fellow-Christians. Has the thirst of riches seduced</a>
<a id='line_243'>      you from the blessings of peace? Sheathe your sword, open your</a>
<a id='line_244'>      hand, and I will satiate the utmost measure of your desires.” The</a>

<a id='line_311'>      mighty people who had conquered and reigned from China to the</a>

<a id='line_313'>      and amity with the eastern Turks on the confines of Persia and</a>
<a id='line_314'>      after a separation of three hundred and fifty years, the</a>
<a id='line_315'>      missionaries of the king of Hungary discovered and visited their</a>
<a id='line_316'>      ancient country near the banks of the Volga. They were hospitably</a>
<a id='line_317'>      entertained by a people of Pagans and Savages who still bore the</a>
<a id='line_318'>      name of Hungarians; conversed in their native tongue, recollected</a>
<a id='line_319'>      a tradition of their long-lost brethren, and listened with</a>
<a id='line_320'>      amazement to the marvellous tale of their new kingdom and</a>
<a id='line_321'>      religion. The zeal of conversion was animated by the interest of</a>
<a id='line_322'>      consanguinity; and one of the greatest of their princes had</a>
<a id='line_323'>      formed the generous, though fruitless, design of replenishing the</a>
<a id='line_324'>      solitude of Pannonia by this domestic colony from the heart of</a>
<a id='line_325'>      Tartary. 21 From this primitive country they were driven to the</a>
<a id='line_326'>      West by the tide of war and emigration, by the weight of the more</a>
<a id='line_327'>      distant tribes, who at the same time were fugitives and</a>
<a id='line_328'>      conquerors. 2111 Reason or fortune directed their course towards</a>
<a id='line_329'>      the frontiers of the Roman empire: they halted in the usual</a>
<a id='line_330'>      stations along the banks of the great rivers; and in the</a>
<a id='line_331'>      territories of Moscow, Kiow, and Moldavia, some vestiges have</a>
<a id='line_332'>      been discovered of their temporary residence. In this long and</a>
<a id='line_333'>      various peregrination, they could not always escape the dominion</a>
<a id='line_334'>      of the stronger; and the purity of their blood was improved or</a>
<a id='line_335'>      sullied by the mixture of a foreign race: from a motive of</a>
<a id='line_336'>      compulsion, or choice, several tribes of the Chazars were</a>

<a id='line_497'>      the tenth century. Except the merit and fame of military prowess,</a>
<a id='line_498'>      all that is valued by mankind appeared vile and contemptible to</a>
<a id='line_499'>      these Barbarians, whose native fierceness was stimulated by the</a>
<a id='line_500'>      consciousness of numbers and freedom. The tents of the Hungarians</a>
<a id='line_501'>      were of leather, their garments of fur; they shaved their hair,</a>
<a id='line_502'>      and scarified their faces: in speech they were slow, in action</a>
<a id='line_503'>      prompt, in treaty perfidious; and they shared the common reproach</a>
<a id='line_504'>      of Barbarians, too ignorant to conceive the importance of truth,</a>
<a id='line_505'>      too proud to deny or palliate the breach of their most solemn</a>
<a id='line_506'>      engagements. Their simplicity has been praised; yet they</a>
<a id='line_507'>      abstained only from the luxury they had never known; whatever</a>
<a id='line_508'>      they saw they coveted; their desires were insatiate, and their</a>
<a id='line_509'>      sole industry was the hand of violence and rapine. By the</a>
<a id='line_510'>      definition of a pastoral nation, I have recalled a long</a>
<a id='line_511'>      description of the economy, the warfare, and the government that</a>
<a id='line_512'>      prevail in that state of society; I may add, that to fishing, as</a>
<a id='line_513'>      well as to the chase, the Hungarians were indebted for a part of</a>
<a id='line_514'>      their subsistence; and since they seldom cultivated the ground,</a>
<a id='line_515'>      they must, at least in their new settlements, have sometimes</a>
<a id='line_516'>      practised a slight and unskilful husbandry. In their emigrations,</a>
<a id='line_517'>      perhaps in their expeditions, the host was accompanied by</a>
<a id='line_518'>      thousands of sheep and oxen which increased the cloud of</a>
<a id='line_519'>      formidable dust, and afforded a constant and wholesale supply of</a>
<a id='line_520'>      milk and animal food. A plentiful command of forage was the first</a>
<a id='line_521'>      care of the general, and if the flocks and herds were secure of</a>
<a id='line_522'>      their pastures, the hardy warrior was alike insensible of danger</a>
<a id='line_523'>      and fatigue. The confusion of men and cattle that overspread the</a>
<a id='line_524'>      country exposed their camp to a nocturnal surprise, had not a</a>
<a id='line_525'>      still wider circuit been occupied by their light cavalry,</a>
<a id='line_526'>      perpetually in motion to discover and delay the approach of the</a>
<a id='line_527'>      enemy. After some experience of the Roman tactics, they adopted</a>
<a id='line_528'>      the use of the sword and spear, the helmet of the soldier, and</a>
<a id='line_529'>      the iron breastplate of his steed: but their native and deadly</a>
<a id='line_530'>      weapon was the Tartar bow: from the earliest infancy their</a>
<a id='line_531'>      children and servants were exercised in the double science of</a>
<a id='line_532'>      archery and horsemanship; their arm was strong; their aim was</a>
<a id='line_533'>      sure; and in the most rapid career, they were taught to throw</a>
<a id='line_534'>      themselves backwards, and to shoot a volley of arrows into the</a>
<a id='line_535'>      air. In open combat, in secret ambush, in flight, or pursuit,</a>
<a id='line_536'>      they were equally formidable; an appearance of order was</a>
<a id='line_537'>      maintained in the foremost ranks, but their charge was driven</a>
<a id='line_538'>      forwards by the impatient pressure of succeeding crowds. They</a>
<a id='line_539'>      pursued, headlong and rash, with loosened reins and horrific</a>
<a id='line_540'>      outcries; but, if they fled, with real or dissembled fear, the</a>
<a id='line_541'>      ardor of a pursuing foe was checked and chastised by the same</a>
<a id='line_542'>      habits of irregular speed and sudden evolution. In the abuse of</a>
<a id='line_543'>      victory, they astonished Europe, yet smarting from the wounds of</a>
<a id='line_544'>      the Saracen and the Dane: mercy they rarely asked, and more</a>
<a id='line_545'>      rarely bestowed: both sexes if accused is equally inaccessible to</a>
<a id='line_546'>      pity, and their appetite for raw flesh might countenance the</a>
<a id='line_547'>      popular tale, that they drank the blood, and feasted on the</a>
<a id='line_548'>      hearts of the slain. Yet the Hungarians were not devoid of those</a>
<a id='line_549'>      principles of justice and humanity, which nature has implanted in</a>
<a id='line_550'>      every bosom. The license of public and private injuries was</a>
<a id='line_551'>      restrained by laws and punishments; and in the security of an</a>
<a id='line_552'>      open camp, theft is the most tempting and most dangerous offence.</a>
<a id='line_553'>      Among the Barbarians there were many, whose spontaneous virtue</a>
<a id='line_554'>      supplied their laws and corrected their manners, who performed</a>
<a id='line_555'>      the duties, and sympathized with the affections, of social life.</a>

<a id='line_569'>      After a long pilgrimage of flight or victory, the Turkish hordes</a>
<a id='line_570'>      approached the common limits of the French and Byzantine empires.</a>
<a id='line_571'>      Their first conquests and final settlements extended on either</a>
<a id='line_572'>      side of the Danube above Vienna, below Belgrade, and beyond the</a>
<a id='line_573'>      measure of the Roman province of Pannonia, or the modern kingdom</a>
<a id='line_574'>      of Hungary. 30 That ample and fertile land was loosely occupied</a>
<a id='line_575'>      by the Moravians, a Sclavonian name and tribe, which were driven</a>
<a id='line_576'>      by the invaders into the compass of a narrow province.</a>
<a id='line_577'>      Charlemagne had stretched a vague and nominal empire as far as</a>
<a id='line_578'>      the edge of Transylvania; but, after the failure of his</a>
<a id='line_579'>      legitimate line, the dukes of Moravia forgot their obedience and</a>
<a id='line_580'>      tribute to the monarchs of Oriental France. The bastard Arnulph</a>
<a id='line_581'>      was provoked to invite the arms of the Turks: they rushed through</a>
<a id='line_582'>      the real or figurative wall, which his indiscretion had thrown</a>
<a id='line_583'>      open; and the king of Germany has been justly reproached as a</a>
<a id='line_584'>      traitor to the civil and ecclesiastical society of the</a>
<a id='line_585'>      Christians. During the life of Arnulph, the Hungarians were</a>
<a id='line_586'>      checked by gratitude or fear; but in the infancy of his son Lewis</a>
<a id='line_587'>      they discovered and invaded Bavaria; and such was their Scythian</a>
<a id='line_588'>      speed, that in a single day a circuit of fifty miles was stripped</a>
<a id='line_589'>      and consumed. In the battle of Augsburgh the Christians</a>
<a id='line_590'>      maintained their advantage till the seventh hour of the day, they</a>
<a id='line_591'>      were deceived and vanquished by the flying stratagems of the</a>
<a id='line_592'>      Turkish cavalry. The conflagration spread over the provinces of</a>
<a id='line_593'>      Bavaria, Swabia, and Franconia; and the Hungarians 31 promoted</a>
<a id='line_594'>      the reign of anarchy, by forcing the stoutest barons to</a>
<a id='line_595'>      discipline their vassals and fortify their castles. The origin of</a>
<a id='line_596'>      walled towns is ascribed to this calamitous period; nor could any</a>
<a id='line_597'>      distance be secure against an enemy, who, almost at the same</a>
<a id='line_598'>      instant, laid in ashes the Helvetian monastery of St. Gall, and</a>
<a id='line_599'>      the city of Bremen, on the shores of the northern ocean. Above</a>
<a id='line_600'>      thirty years the Germanic empire, or kingdom, was subject to the</a>
<a id='line_601'>      ignominy of tribute; and resistance was disarmed by the menace,</a>
<a id='line_602'>      the serious and effectual menace of dragging the women and</a>
<a id='line_603'>      children into captivity, and of slaughtering the males above the</a>
<a id='line_604'>      age of ten years. I have neither power nor inclination to follow</a>
<a id='line_605'>      the Hungarians beyond the Rhine; but I must observe with</a>
<a id='line_606'>      surprise, that the southern provinces of France were blasted by</a>
<a id='line_607'>      the tempest, and that Spain, behind her Pyrenees, was astonished</a>
<a id='line_608'>      at the approach of these formidable strangers. 32 The vicinity of</a>
<a id='line_609'>      Italy had tempted their early inroads; but from their camp on the</a>
<a id='line_610'>      Brenta, they beheld with some terror the apparent strength and</a>
<a id='line_611'>      populousness of the new discovered country. They requested leave</a>
<a id='line_612'>      to retire; their request was proudly rejected by the Italian</a>
<a id='line_613'>      king; and the lives of twenty thousand Christians paid the</a>
<a id='line_614'>      forfeit of his obstinacy and rashness. Among the cities of the</a>
<a id='line_615'>      West, the royal Pavia was conspicuous in fame and splendor; and</a>
<a id='line_616'>      the preeminence of Rome itself was only derived from the relics</a>
<a id='line_617'>      of the apostles. The Hungarians appeared; Pavia was in flames;</a>
<a id='line_618'>      forty-three churches were consumed; and, after the massacre of</a>
<a id='line_619'>      the people, they spared about two hundred wretches who had</a>
<a id='line_620'>      gathered some bushels of gold and silver (a vague exaggeration)</a>
<a id='line_621'>      from the smoking ruins of their country. In these annual</a>
<a id='line_622'>      excursions from the Alps to the neighborhood of Rome and Capua,</a>
<a id='line_623'>      the churches, that yet escaped, resounded with a fearful litany:</a>
<a id='line_624'>      “O, save and deliver us from the arrows of the Hungarians!” But</a>
<a id='line_625'>      the saints were deaf or inexorable; and the torrent rolled</a>
<a id='line_626'>      forwards, till it was stopped by the extreme land of Calabria. 33</a>
<a id='line_627'>      A composition was offered and accepted for the head of each</a>
<a id='line_628'>      Italian subject; and ten bushels of silver were poured forth in</a>
<a id='line_629'>      the Turkish camp. But falsehood is the natural antagonist of</a>
<a id='line_630'>      violence; and the robbers were defrauded both in the numbers of</a>
<a id='line_631'>      the assessment and the standard of the metal. On the side of the</a>
<a id='line_632'>      East, the Hungarians were opposed in doubtful conflict by the</a>
<a id='line_633'>      equal arms of the Bulgarians, whose faith forbade an alliance</a>
<a id='line_634'>      with the Pagans, and whose situation formed the barrier of the</a>
<a id='line_635'>      Byzantine empire. The barrier was overturned; the emperor of</a>
<a id='line_636'>      Constantinople beheld the waving banners of the Turks; and one of</a>
<a id='line_637'>      their boldest warriors presumed to strike a battle-axe into the</a>
<a id='line_638'>      golden gate. The arts and treasures of the Greeks diverted the</a>
<a id='line_639'>      assault; but the Hungarians might boast, in their retreat, that</a>
<a id='line_640'>      they had imposed a tribute on the spirit of Bulgaria and the</a>
<a id='line_641'>      majesty of the Caesars. 34 The remote and rapid operations of the</a>
<a id='line_642'>      same campaign appear to magnify the power and numbers of the</a>
<a id='line_643'>      Turks; but their courage is most deserving of praise, since a</a>
<a id='line_644'>      light troop of three or four hundred horse would often attempt</a>
<a id='line_645'>      and execute the most daring inroads to the gates of Thessalonica</a>
<a id='line_646'>      and Constantinople. At this disastrous aera of the ninth and</a>
<a id='line_647'>      tenth centuries, Europe was afflicted by a triple scourge from</a>
<a id='line_648'>      the North, the East, and the South: the Norman, the Hungarian,</a>
<a id='line_649'>      and the Saracen, sometimes trod the same ground of desolation;</a>

<a id='line_698'>      invasion of his country; but his mind was vigorous and his</a>
<a id='line_699'>      prudence successful. “My companions,” said he, on the morning of</a>

<a id='line_701'>      first arrows of the Pagans, and prevent their second discharge by</a>

<a id='line_704'>      expressed the features, or at least the character, of Henry, who,</a>
<a id='line_705'>      in an age of ignorance, intrusted to the finer arts the</a>
<a id='line_706'>      perpetuity of his name. 37 At the end of twenty years, the</a>

<a id='line_708'>      empire of his son; and their force is defined, in the lowest</a>

<a id='line_710'>      domestic faction; the gates of Germany were treacherously</a>
<a id='line_711'>      unlocked; and they spread, far beyond the Rhine and the Meuse,</a>

<a id='line_714'>      unless they were true to each other, their religion and country</a>
<a id='line_715'>      were irrecoverably lost; and the national powers were reviewed in</a>
<a id='line_716'>      the plains of Augsburgh. They marched and fought in eight</a>
<a id='line_717'>      legions, according to the division of provinces and tribes; the</a>
<a id='line_718'>      first, second, and third, were composed of Bavarians; the fourth,</a>

<a id='line_725'>      with a fast; the camp was blessed with the relics of saints and</a>
<a id='line_726'>      martyrs; and the Christian hero girded on his side the sword of</a>
<a id='line_727'>      Constantine, grasped the invincible spear of Charlemagne, and</a>
<a id='line_728'>      waved the banner of St. Maurice, the praefect of the Thebaean</a>
<a id='line_729'>      legion. But his firmest confidence was placed in the holy lance,</a>
<a id='line_730'>      38 whose point was fashioned of the nails of the cross, and which</a>
<a id='line_731'>      his father had extorted from the king of Burgundy, by the threats</a>

<a id='line_737'>      duke, the valiant Conrad, was pierced with an arrow as he rested</a>

<a id='line_748'>      the most accessible passes of Hungary were fortified with a ditch</a>

<a id='line_843'>      independent chieftains and desperate adventurers, who sighed in</a>
<a id='line_844'>      the laziness of peace, and smiled in the agonies of death. Piracy</a>
<a id='line_845'>      was the exercise, the trade, the glory, and the virtue, of the</a>
<a id='line_846'>      Scandinavian youth. Impatient of a bleak climate and narrow</a>

<a id='line_848'>      sounded their horn, ascended their vessels, and explored every</a>

<a id='line_982'>      of the Sclavonian; but in the tenth century, these two modes of</a>
<a id='line_983'>      speech were different from each other; and, as the Sclavonian</a>
<a id='line_984'>      prevailed in the South, it may be presumed that the original</a>
<a id='line_985'>      Russians of the North, the primitive subjects of the Varangian</a>
<a id='line_986'>      chief, were a portion of the Fennic race. With the emigration,</a>
<a id='line_987'>      union, or dissolution, of the wandering tribes, the loose and</a>
<a id='line_988'>      indefinite picture of the Scythian desert has continually</a>
<a id='line_989'>      shifted. But the most ancient map of Russia affords some places</a>
<a id='line_990'>      which still retain their name and position; and the two capitals,</a>
<a id='line_991'>      Novogorod 50 and Kiow, 51 are coeval with the first age of the</a>
<a id='line_992'>      monarchy. Novogorod had not yet deserved the epithet of great,</a>
<a id='line_993'>      nor the alliance of the Hanseatic League, which diffused the</a>
<a id='line_994'>      streams of opulence and the principles of freedom. Kiow could not</a>
<a id='line_995'>      yet boast of three hundred churches, an innumerable people, and a</a>
<a id='line_996'>      degree of greatness and splendor which was compared with</a>
<a id='line_997'>      Constantinople by those who had never seen the residence of the</a>
<a id='line_998'>      Caesars. In their origin, the two cities were no more than camps</a>
<a id='line_999'>      or fairs, the most convenient stations in which the Barbarians</a>
<a id='line_1000'>      might assemble for the occasional business of war or trade. Yet</a>
<a id='line_1001'>      even these assemblies announce some progress in the arts of</a>
<a id='line_1002'>      society; a new breed of cattle was imported from the southern</a>
<a id='line_1003'>      provinces; and the spirit of commercial enterprise pervaded the</a>
<a id='line_1004'>      sea and land, from the Baltic to the Euxine, from the mouth of</a>
<a id='line_1005'>      the Oder to the port of Constantinople. In the days of idolatry</a>
<a id='line_1006'>      and barbarism, the Sclavonic city of Julin was frequented and</a>
<a id='line_1007'>      enriched by the Normans, who had prudently secured a free mart of</a>
<a id='line_1008'>      purchase and exchange. 52 From this harbor, at the entrance of</a>
<a id='line_1009'>      the Oder, the corsair, or merchant, sailed in forty-three days to</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      the eastern shores of the Baltic, the most distant nations were</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      intermingled, and the holy groves of Curland are said to have</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      been decorated with Grecian and Spanish gold. 53 Between the sea</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      and Novogorod an easy intercourse was discovered; in the summer,</a>
<a id='line_1014'>      through a gulf, a lake, and a navigable river; in the winter</a>
<a id='line_1015'>      season, over the hard and level surface of boundless snows. From</a>
<a id='line_1016'>      the neighborhood of that city, the Russians descended the streams</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      that fall into the Borysthenes; their canoes, of a single tree,</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      were laden with slaves of every age, furs of every species, the</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      spoil of their beehives, and the hides of their cattle; and the</a>
<a id='line_1020'>      whole produce of the North was collected and discharged in the</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      magazines of Kiow. The month of June was the ordinary season of</a>
<a id='line_1022'>      the departure of the fleet: the timber of the canoes was framed</a>
<a id='line_1023'>      into the oars and benches of more solid and capacious boats; and</a>
<a id='line_1024'>      they proceeded without obstacle down the Borysthenes, as far as</a>
<a id='line_1025'>      the seven or thirteen ridges of rocks, which traverse the bed,</a>
<a id='line_1026'>      and precipitate the waters, of the river. At the more shallow</a>
<a id='line_1027'>      falls it was sufficient to lighten the vessels; but the deeper</a>
<a id='line_1028'>      cataracts were impassable; and the mariners, who dragged their</a>
<a id='line_1029'>      vessels and their slaves six miles over land, were exposed in</a>
<a id='line_1030'>      this toilsome journey to the robbers of the desert. 54 At the</a>
<a id='line_1031'>      first island below the falls, the Russians celebrated the</a>
<a id='line_1032'>      festival of their escape: at a second, near the mouth of the</a>
<a id='line_1033'>      river, they repaired their shattered vessels for the longer and</a>
<a id='line_1034'>      more perilous voyage of the Black Sea. If they steered along the</a>

<a id='line_1119'>      hundred and ninety years, the Russians made four attempts to</a>
<a id='line_1120'>      plunder the treasures of Constantinople: the event was various,</a>
<a id='line_1121'>      but the motive, the means, and the object, were the same in these</a>
<a id='line_1122'>      naval expeditions. 56 The Russian traders had seen the</a>
<a id='line_1123'>      magnificence, and tasted the luxury of the city of the Caesars. A</a>
<a id='line_1124'>      marvellous tale, and a scanty supply, excited the desires of</a>
<a id='line_1125'>      their savage countrymen: they envied the gifts of nature which</a>
<a id='line_1126'>      their climate denied; they coveted the works of art, which they</a>
<a id='line_1127'>      were too lazy to imitate and too indigent to purchase; the</a>
<a id='line_1128'>      Varangian princes unfurled the banners of piratical adventure,</a>
<a id='line_1129'>      and their bravest soldiers were drawn from the nations that dwelt</a>
<a id='line_1130'>      in the northern isles of the ocean. 57 The image of their naval</a>
<a id='line_1131'>      armaments was revived in the last century, in the fleets of the</a>
<a id='line_1132'>      Cossacks, which issued from the Borysthenes, to navigate the same</a>
<a id='line_1133'>      seas for a similar purpose. 58 The Greek appellation of monoxyla,</a>
<a id='line_1134'>      or single canoes, might justly be applied to the bottom of their</a>
<a id='line_1135'>      vessels. It was scooped out of the long stem of a beech or</a>
<a id='line_1136'>      willow, but the slight and narrow foundation was raised and</a>
<a id='line_1137'>      continued on either side with planks, till it attained the length</a>
<a id='line_1138'>      of sixty, and the height of about twelve, feet. These boats were</a>
<a id='line_1139'>      built without a deck, but with two rudders and a mast; to move</a>
<a id='line_1140'>      with sails and oars; and to contain from forty to seventy men,</a>
<a id='line_1141'>      with their arms, and provisions of fresh water and salt fish. The</a>
<a id='line_1142'>      first trial of the Russians was made with two hundred boats; but</a>
<a id='line_1143'>      when the national force was exerted, they might arm against</a>
<a id='line_1144'>      Constantinople a thousand or twelve hundred vessels. Their fleet</a>
<a id='line_1145'>      was not much inferior to the royal navy of Agamemnon, but it was</a>
<a id='line_1146'>      magnified in the eyes of fear to ten or fifteen times the real</a>
<a id='line_1147'>      proportion of its strength and numbers. Had the Greek emperors</a>
<a id='line_1148'>      been endowed with foresight to discern, and vigor to prevent,</a>
<a id='line_1149'>      perhaps they might have sealed with a maritime force the mouth of</a>
<a id='line_1150'>      the Borysthenes. Their indolence abandoned the coast of Anatolia</a>
<a id='line_1151'>      to the calamities of a piratical war, which, after an interval of</a>
<a id='line_1152'>      six hundred years, again infested the Euxine; but as long as the</a>
<a id='line_1153'>      capital was respected, the sufferings of a distant province</a>
<a id='line_1154'>      escaped the notice both of the prince and the historian. The</a>
<a id='line_1155'>      storm which had swept along from the Phasis and Trebizond, at</a>
<a id='line_1156'>      length burst on the Bosphorus of Thrace; a strait of fifteen</a>
<a id='line_1157'>      miles, in which the rude vessels of the Russians might have been</a>
<a id='line_1158'>      stopped and destroyed by a more skilful adversary. In their first</a>
<a id='line_1159'>      enterprise 59 under the princes of Kiow, they passed without</a>
<a id='line_1160'>      opposition, and occupied the port of Constantinople in the</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      absence of the emperor Michael, the son of Theophilus. Through a</a>
<a id='line_1162'>      crowd of perils, he landed at the palace-stairs, and immediately</a>
<a id='line_1163'>      repaired to a church of the Virgin Mary. 60 By the advice of the</a>
<a id='line_1164'>      patriarch, her garment, a precious relic, was drawn from the</a>
<a id='line_1165'>      sanctuary and dipped in the sea; and a seasonable tempest, which</a>
<a id='line_1166'>      determined the retreat of the Russians, was devoutly ascribed to</a>
<a id='line_1167'>      the mother of God. 61 The silence of the Greeks may inspire some</a>
<a id='line_1168'>      doubt of the truth, or at least of the importance, of the second</a>
<a id='line_1169'>      attempt by Oleg, the guardian of the sons of Ruric. 62 A strong</a>
<a id='line_1170'>      barrier of arms and fortifications defended the Bosphorus: they</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      were eluded by the usual expedient of drawing the boats over the</a>
<a id='line_1172'>      isthmus; and this simple operation is described in the national</a>
<a id='line_1173'>      chronicles, as if the Russian fleet had sailed over dry land with</a>
<a id='line_1174'>      a brisk and favorable gale. The leader of the third armament,</a>
<a id='line_1175'>      Igor, the son of Ruric, had chosen a moment of weakness and</a>
<a id='line_1176'>      decay, when the naval powers of the empire were employed against</a>
<a id='line_1177'>      the Saracens. But if courage be not wanting, the instruments of</a>
<a id='line_1178'>      defence are seldom deficient. Fifteen broken and decayed galleys</a>
<a id='line_1179'>      were boldly launched against the enemy; but instead of the single</a>
<a id='line_1180'>      tube of Greek fire usually planted on the prow, the sides and</a>
<a id='line_1181'>      stern of each vessel were abundantly supplied with that liquid</a>
<a id='line_1182'>      combustible. The engineers were dexterous; the weather was</a>
<a id='line_1183'>      propitious; many thousand Russians, who chose rather to be</a>
<a id='line_1184'>      drowned than burnt, leaped into the sea; and those who escaped to</a>
<a id='line_1185'>      the Thracian shore were inhumanly slaughtered by the peasants and</a>
<a id='line_1186'>      soldiers. Yet one third of the canoes escaped into shallow water;</a>
<a id='line_1187'>      and the next spring Igor was again prepared to retrieve his</a>
<a id='line_1188'>      disgrace and claim his revenge. 63 After a long peace, Jaroslaus,</a>

<a id='line_1295'>      mind and body was fortified by the hardships of a military and</a>

<a id='line_1299'>      often horse-flesh) was broiled or roasted on the coals. The</a>
<a id='line_1300'>      exercise of war gave stability and discipline to his army; and it</a>
<a id='line_1301'>      may be presumed, that no soldier was permitted to transcend the</a>

<a id='line_1304'>      a gift of fifteen hundred pounds of gold was laid at his feet to</a>

<a id='line_1307'>      sailed from the Borysthenes to the Danube; their landing was</a>
<a id='line_1308'>      effected on the Maesian shore; and, after a sharp encounter, the</a>
<a id='line_1309'>      swords of the Russians prevailed against the arrows of the</a>
<a id='line_1310'>      Bulgarian horse. The vanquished king sunk into the grave; his</a>
<a id='line_1311'>      children were made captive; and his dominions, as far as Mount</a>
<a id='line_1312'>      Haemus, were subdued or ravaged by the northern invaders. But</a>
<a id='line_1313'>      instead of relinquishing his prey, and performing his</a>

<a id='line_1380'>      solemn imprecations, to relinquish all hostile designs; a safe</a>
<a id='line_1381'>      passage was opened for his return; the liberty of trade and</a>

<a id='line_1458'>      she received the venerable name of the empress Helena; and her</a>
<a id='line_1459'>      conversion might be preceded or followed by her uncle, two</a>
<a id='line_1460'>      interpreters, sixteen damsels of a higher, and eighteen of a</a>
<a id='line_1461'>      lower rank, twenty-two domestics or ministers, and forty-four</a>
<a id='line_1462'>      Russian merchants, who composed the retinue of the great princess</a>
<a id='line_1463'>      Olga. After her return to Kiow and Novogorod, she firmly</a>
<a id='line_1464'>      persisted in her new religion; but her labors in the propagation</a>
<a id='line_1465'>      of the gospel were not crowned with success; and both her family</a>
<a id='line_1466'>      and nation adhered with obstinacy or indifference to the gods of</a>
<a id='line_1467'>      their fathers. Her son Swatoslaus was apprehensive of the scorn</a>
<a id='line_1468'>      and ridicule of his companions; and her grandson Wolodomir</a>
<a id='line_1469'>      devoted his youthful zeal to multiply and decorate the monuments</a>
<a id='line_1470'>      of ancient worship. The savage deities of the North were still</a>
<a id='line_1471'>      propitiated with human sacrifices: in the choice of the victim, a</a>
<a id='line_1472'>      citizen was preferred to a stranger, a Christian to an idolater;</a>
<a id='line_1473'>      and the father, who defended his son from the sacerdotal knife,</a>
<a id='line_1474'>      was involved in the same doom by the rage of a fanatic tumult.</a>
<a id='line_1475'>      Yet the lessons and example of the pious Olga had made a deep,</a>
<a id='line_1476'>      though secret, impression in the minds of the prince and people:</a>
<a id='line_1477'>      the Greek missionaries continued to preach, to dispute, and to</a>
<a id='line_1478'>      baptize: and the ambassadors or merchants of Russia compared the</a>
<a id='line_1479'>      idolatry of the woods with the elegant superstition of</a>
<a id='line_1480'>      Constantinople. They had gazed with admiration on the dome of St.</a>
<a id='line_1481'>      Sophia: the lively pictures of saints and martyrs, the riches of</a>
<a id='line_1482'>      the altar, the number and vestments of the priests, the pomp and</a>
<a id='line_1483'>      order of the ceremonies; they were edified by the alternate</a>
<a id='line_1484'>      succession of devout silence and harmonious song; nor was it</a>
<a id='line_1485'>      difficult to persuade them, that a choir of angels descended each</a>
<a id='line_1486'>      day from heaven to join in the devotion of the Christians. 76 But</a>
<a id='line_1487'>      the conversion of Wolodomir was determined, or hastened, by his</a>
<a id='line_1488'>      desire of a Roman bride. At the same time, and in the city of</a>
<a id='line_1489'>      Cherson, the rites of baptism and marriage were celebrated by the</a>
<a id='line_1490'>      Christian pontiff: the city he restored to the emperor Basil, the</a>
<a id='line_1491'>      brother of his spouse; but the brazen gates were transported, as</a>
<a id='line_1492'>      it is said, to Novogorod, and erected before the first church as</a>
<a id='line_1493'>      a trophy of his victory and faith. 77 At his despotic command,</a>
<a id='line_1494'>      Peround, the god of thunder, whom he had so long adored, was</a>
<a id='line_1495'>      dragged through the streets of Kiow; and twelve sturdy Barbarians</a>
<a id='line_1496'>      battered with clubs the misshapen image, which was indignantly</a>
<a id='line_1497'>      cast into the waters of the Borysthenes. The edict of Wolodomir</a>
<a id='line_1498'>      had proclaimed, that all who should refuse the rites of baptism</a>
<a id='line_1499'>      would be treated as the enemies of God and their prince; and the</a>
<a id='line_1500'>      rivers were instantly filled with many thousands of obedient</a>

<a id='line_1502'>      doctrine which had been embraced by the great duke and his</a>
<a id='line_1503'>      boyars. In the next generation, the relics of Paganism were</a>
<a id='line_1504'>      finally extirpated; but as the two brothers of Wolodomir had died</a>
<a id='line_1505'>      without baptism, their bones were taken from the grave, and</a>

<a id='line_1549'>      Greece, to visit the tents and huts of the Barbarians: poverty,</a>

<a id='line_1554'>      fruitful harvest of their toils was inherited and enjoyed by the</a>
<a id='line_1555'>      proud and wealthy prelates of succeeding times. The first</a>
<a id='line_1556'>      conversions were free and spontaneous: a holy life and an</a>

<a id='line_1559'>      visions of the strangers; and the favorable temper of the chiefs</a>
<a id='line_1560'>      was accelerated by the dictates of vanity and interest. The</a>
<a id='line_1561'>      leaders of nations, who were saluted with the titles of kings and</a>
<a id='line_1562'>      saints, 79 held it lawful and pious to impose the Catholic faith</a>
<a id='line_1563'>      on their subjects and neighbors; the coast of the Baltic, from</a>
<a id='line_1564'>      Holstein to the Gulf of Finland, was invaded under the standard</a>
<a id='line_1565'>      of the cross; and the reign of idolatry was closed by the</a>
<a id='line_1566'>      conversion of Lithuania in the fourteenth century. Yet truth and</a>
<a id='line_1567'>      candor must acknowledge, that the conversion of the North</a>
<a id='line_1568'>      imparted many temporal benefits both to the old and the new</a>
<a id='line_1569'>      Christians. The rage of war, inherent to the human species, could</a>
<a id='line_1570'>      not be healed by the evangelic precepts of charity and peace; and</a>
<a id='line_1571'>      the ambition of Catholic princes has renewed in every age the</a>
<a id='line_1572'>      calamities of hostile contention. But the admission of the</a>
<a id='line_1573'>      Barbarians into the pale of civil and ecclesiastical society</a>
<a id='line_1574'>      delivered Europe from the depredations, by sea and land, of the</a>
<a id='line_1575'>      Normans, the Hungarians, and the Russians, who learned to spare</a>
<a id='line_1576'>      their brethren and cultivate their possessions. 80 The</a>
<a id='line_1577'>      establishment of law and order was promoted by the influence of</a>
<a id='line_1578'>      the clergy; and the rudiments of art and science were introduced</a>
<a id='line_1579'>      into the savage countries of the globe. The liberal piety of the</a>
<a id='line_1580'>      Russian princes engaged in their service the most skilful of the</a>
<a id='line_1581'>      Greeks, to decorate the cities and instruct the inhabitants: the</a>
<a id='line_1582'>      dome and the paintings of St. Sophia were rudely copied in the</a>
<a id='line_1583'>      churches of Kiow and Novogorod: the writings of the fathers were</a>
<a id='line_1584'>      translated into the Sclavonic idiom; and three hundred noble</a>
