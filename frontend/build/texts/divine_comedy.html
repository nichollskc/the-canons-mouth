<a id='line_216'>INFERNO</a>
<a id='line_217'></a>
<a id='line_218'></a>
<a id='line_219'></a>
<a id='line_220'></a>
<a id='line_221'>Inferno: Canto I</a>
<a id='line_222'></a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>Midway upon the journey of our life</a>
<a id='line_225'>    I found myself within a forest dark,</a>
<a id='line_226'>    For the straightforward pathway had been lost.</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say</a>
<a id='line_229'>    What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,</a>
<a id='line_230'>    Which in the very thought renews the fear.</a>
<a id='line_231'></a>
<a id='line_232'>So bitter is it, death is little more;</a>
<a id='line_233'>    But of the good to treat, which there I found,</a>
<a id='line_234'>    Speak will I of the other things I saw there.</a>
<a id='line_235'></a>
<a id='line_236'>I cannot well repeat how there I entered,</a>
<a id='line_237'>    So full was I of slumber at the moment</a>
<a id='line_238'>    In which I had abandoned the true way.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>But after I had reached a mountain’s foot,</a>
<a id='line_241'>    At that point where the valley terminated,</a>
<a id='line_242'>    Which had with consternation pierced my heart,</a>
<a id='line_243'></a>
<a id='line_244'>Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,</a>
<a id='line_245'>    Vested already with that planet’s rays</a>
<a id='line_246'>    Which leadeth others right by every road.</a>
<a id='line_247'></a>
<a id='line_248'>Then was the fear a little quieted</a>
<a id='line_249'>    That in my heart’s lake had endured throughout</a>
<a id='line_250'>    The night, which I had passed so piteously.</a>
<a id='line_251'></a>
<a id='line_252'>And even as he, who, with distressful breath,</a>
<a id='line_253'>    Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,</a>
<a id='line_254'>    Turns to the water perilous and gazes;</a>
<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'>So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,</a>
<a id='line_257'>    Turn itself back to re-behold the pass</a>
<a id='line_258'>    Which never yet a living person left.</a>
<a id='line_259'></a>
<a id='line_260'>After my weary body I had rested,</a>
<a id='line_261'>    The way resumed I on the desert slope,</a>
<a id='line_262'>    So that the firm foot ever was the lower.</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>And lo! almost where the ascent began,</a>
<a id='line_265'>    A panther light and swift exceedingly,</a>
<a id='line_266'>    Which with a spotted skin was covered o’er!</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>And never moved she from before my face,</a>
<a id='line_269'>    Nay, rather did impede so much my way,</a>
<a id='line_270'>    That many times I to return had turned.</a>
<a id='line_271'></a>
<a id='line_272'>The time was the beginning of the morning,</a>
<a id='line_273'>    And up the sun was mounting with those stars</a>
<a id='line_274'>    That with him were, what time the Love Divine</a>
<a id='line_275'></a>
<a id='line_276'>At first in motion set those beauteous things;</a>
<a id='line_277'>    So were to me occasion of good hope,</a>
<a id='line_278'>    The variegated skin of that wild beast,</a>
<a id='line_279'></a>
<a id='line_280'>The hour of time, and the delicious season;</a>
<a id='line_281'>    But not so much, that did not give me fear</a>
<a id='line_282'>    A lion’s aspect which appeared to me.</a>
<a id='line_283'></a>
<a id='line_284'>He seemed as if against me he were coming</a>
<a id='line_285'>    With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,</a>
<a id='line_286'>    So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;</a>
<a id='line_287'></a>
<a id='line_288'>And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings</a>
<a id='line_289'>    Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,</a>
<a id='line_290'>    And many folk has caused to live forlorn!</a>
<a id='line_291'></a>
<a id='line_292'>She brought upon me so much heaviness,</a>
<a id='line_293'>    With the affright that from her aspect came,</a>
<a id='line_294'>    That I the hope relinquished of the height.</a>
<a id='line_295'></a>
<a id='line_296'>And as he is who willingly acquires,</a>
<a id='line_297'>    And the time comes that causes him to lose,</a>
<a id='line_298'>    Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,</a>
<a id='line_299'></a>
<a id='line_300'>E’en such made me that beast withouten peace,</a>
<a id='line_301'>    Which, coming on against me by degrees</a>
<a id='line_302'>    Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.</a>
<a id='line_303'></a>
<a id='line_304'>While I was rushing downward to the lowland,</a>
<a id='line_305'>    Before mine eyes did one present himself,</a>
<a id='line_306'>    Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.</a>
<a id='line_307'></a>
<a id='line_308'>When I beheld him in the desert vast,</a>
<a id='line_309'>    “Have pity on me,” unto him I cried,</a>
<a id='line_310'>    “Whiche’er thou art, or shade or real man!”</a>
<a id='line_311'></a>
<a id='line_312'>He answered me: “Not man; man once I was,</a>
<a id='line_313'>    And both my parents were of Lombardy,</a>
<a id='line_314'>    And Mantuans by country both of them.</a>
<a id='line_315'></a>
<a id='line_316'>‘Sub Julio’ was I born, though it was late,</a>
<a id='line_317'>    And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,</a>
<a id='line_318'>    During the time of false and lying gods.</a>
<a id='line_319'></a>
<a id='line_320'>A poet was I, and I sang that just</a>
<a id='line_321'>    Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,</a>
<a id='line_322'>    After that Ilion the superb was burned.</a>
<a id='line_323'></a>
<a id='line_324'>But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?</a>
<a id='line_325'>    Why climb’st thou not the Mount Delectable,</a>
<a id='line_326'>    Which is the source and cause of every joy?”</a>
<a id='line_327'></a>
<a id='line_328'>“Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain</a>
<a id='line_329'>    Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?”</a>
<a id='line_330'>    I made response to him with bashful forehead.</a>
<a id='line_331'></a>
<a id='line_332'>“O, of the other poets honour and light,</a>
<a id='line_333'>    Avail me the long study and great love</a>
<a id='line_334'>    That have impelled me to explore thy volume!</a>
<a id='line_335'></a>
<a id='line_336'>Thou art my master, and my author thou,</a>
<a id='line_337'>    Thou art alone the one from whom I took</a>
<a id='line_338'>    The beautiful style that has done honour to me.</a>
<a id='line_339'></a>
<a id='line_340'>Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;</a>
<a id='line_341'>    Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,</a>
<a id='line_342'>    For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble.”</a>
<a id='line_343'></a>
<a id='line_344'>“Thee it behoves to take another road,”</a>
<a id='line_345'>    Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,</a>
<a id='line_346'>    “If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;</a>
<a id='line_347'></a>
<a id='line_348'>Because this beast, at which thou criest out,</a>
<a id='line_349'>    Suffers not any one to pass her way,</a>
<a id='line_350'>    But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;</a>
<a id='line_351'></a>
<a id='line_352'>And has a nature so malign and ruthless,</a>
<a id='line_353'>    That never doth she glut her greedy will,</a>
<a id='line_354'>    And after food is hungrier than before.</a>
<a id='line_355'></a>
<a id='line_356'>Many the animals with whom she weds,</a>
<a id='line_357'>    And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound</a>
<a id='line_358'>    Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.</a>
<a id='line_359'></a>
<a id='line_360'>He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,</a>
<a id='line_361'>    But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;</a>
<a id='line_362'>    ’Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;</a>
<a id='line_363'></a>
<a id='line_364'>Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,</a>
<a id='line_365'>    On whose account the maid Camilla died,</a>
<a id='line_366'>    Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;</a>
<a id='line_367'></a>
<a id='line_368'>Through every city shall he hunt her down,</a>
<a id='line_369'>    Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,</a>
<a id='line_370'>    There from whence envy first did let her loose.</a>
<a id='line_371'></a>
<a id='line_372'>Therefore I think and judge it for thy best</a>
<a id='line_373'>    Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,</a>
<a id='line_374'>    And lead thee hence through the eternal place,</a>
<a id='line_375'></a>
<a id='line_376'>Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,</a>
<a id='line_377'>    Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,</a>
<a id='line_378'>    Who cry out each one for the second death;</a>
<a id='line_379'></a>
<a id='line_380'>And thou shalt see those who contented are</a>
<a id='line_381'>    Within the fire, because they hope to come,</a>
<a id='line_382'>    Whene’er it may be, to the blessed people;</a>
<a id='line_383'></a>
<a id='line_384'>To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,</a>
<a id='line_385'>    A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;</a>
<a id='line_386'>    With her at my departure I will leave thee;</a>
<a id='line_387'></a>
<a id='line_388'>Because that Emperor, who reigns above,</a>
<a id='line_389'>    In that I was rebellious to his law,</a>
<a id='line_390'>    Wills that through me none come into his city.</a>
<a id='line_391'></a>
<a id='line_392'>He governs everywhere, and there he reigns;</a>
<a id='line_393'>    There is his city and his lofty throne;</a>
<a id='line_394'>    O happy he whom thereto he elects!”</a>
<a id='line_395'></a>
<a id='line_396'>And I to him: “Poet, I thee entreat,</a>
<a id='line_397'>    By that same God whom thou didst never know,</a>
<a id='line_398'>    So that I may escape this woe and worse,</a>
<a id='line_399'></a>
<a id='line_400'>Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,</a>
<a id='line_401'>    That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,</a>
<a id='line_402'>    And those thou makest so disconsolate.”</a>
<a id='line_403'></a>
<a id='line_404'>Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.</a>
<a id='line_405'></a>
<a id='line_406'></a>

<a id='line_408'></a>
<a id='line_409'>Inferno: Canto II</a>
<a id='line_410'></a>
<a id='line_411'></a>
<a id='line_412'>Day was departing, and the embrowned air</a>
<a id='line_413'>    Released the animals that are on earth</a>
<a id='line_414'>    From their fatigues; and I the only one</a>
<a id='line_415'></a>
<a id='line_416'>Made myself ready to sustain the war,</a>
<a id='line_417'>    Both of the way and likewise of the woe,</a>
<a id='line_418'>    Which memory that errs not shall retrace.</a>
<a id='line_419'></a>
<a id='line_420'>O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!</a>
<a id='line_421'>    O memory, that didst write down what I saw,</a>
<a id='line_422'>    Here thy nobility shall be manifest!</a>
<a id='line_423'></a>
<a id='line_424'>And I began: “Poet, who guidest me,</a>

<a id='line_426'>    Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.</a>
<a id='line_427'></a>

<a id='line_429'>    While yet corruptible, unto the world</a>
<a id='line_430'>    Immortal went, and was there bodily.</a>
<a id='line_431'></a>
<a id='line_432'>But if the adversary of all evil</a>
<a id='line_433'>    Was courteous, thinking of the high effect</a>
<a id='line_434'>    That issue would from him, and who, and what,</a>
<a id='line_435'></a>
<a id='line_436'>To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;</a>
<a id='line_437'>    For he was of great Rome, and of her empire</a>
<a id='line_438'>    In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;</a>
<a id='line_439'></a>
<a id='line_440'>The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,</a>
<a id='line_441'>    Were stablished as the holy place, wherein</a>
<a id='line_442'>    Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.</a>
<a id='line_443'></a>
<a id='line_444'>Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,</a>
<a id='line_445'>    Things did he hear, which the occasion were</a>
<a id='line_446'>    Both of his victory and the papal mantle.</a>
<a id='line_447'></a>
<a id='line_448'>Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,</a>
<a id='line_449'>    To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,</a>
<a id='line_450'>    Which of salvation’s way is the beginning.</a>
<a id='line_451'></a>
<a id='line_452'>But I, why thither come, or who concedes it?</a>
<a id='line_453'>    I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,</a>
<a id='line_454'>    Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.</a>
<a id='line_455'></a>
<a id='line_456'>Therefore, if I resign myself to come,</a>
<a id='line_457'>    I fear the coming may be ill-advised;</a>
<a id='line_458'>    Thou’rt wise, and knowest better than I speak.”</a>
<a id='line_459'></a>
<a id='line_460'>And as he is, who unwills what he willed,</a>
<a id='line_461'>    And by new thoughts doth his intention change,</a>
<a id='line_462'>    So that from his design he quite withdraws,</a>
<a id='line_463'></a>
<a id='line_464'>Such I became, upon that dark hillside,</a>
<a id='line_465'>    Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,</a>
<a id='line_466'>    Which was so very prompt in the beginning.</a>
<a id='line_467'></a>
<a id='line_468'>“If I have well thy language understood,”</a>
<a id='line_469'>    Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,</a>
<a id='line_470'>    “Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,</a>
<a id='line_471'></a>
<a id='line_472'>Which many times a man encumbers so,</a>
<a id='line_473'>    It turns him back from honoured enterprise,</a>
<a id='line_474'>    As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.</a>
<a id='line_475'></a>
<a id='line_476'>That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,</a>
<a id='line_477'>    I’ll tell thee why I came, and what I heard</a>
<a id='line_478'>    At the first moment when I grieved for thee.</a>
<a id='line_479'></a>
<a id='line_480'>Among those was I who are in suspense,</a>
<a id='line_481'>    And a fair, saintly Lady called to me</a>
<a id='line_482'>    In such wise, I besought her to command me.</a>
<a id='line_483'></a>
<a id='line_484'>Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star;</a>
<a id='line_485'>    And she began to say, gentle and low,</a>
<a id='line_486'>    With voice angelical, in her own language:</a>
<a id='line_487'></a>
<a id='line_488'>‘O spirit courteous of Mantua,</a>
<a id='line_489'>    Of whom the fame still in the world endures,</a>
<a id='line_490'>    And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;</a>
<a id='line_491'></a>
<a id='line_492'>A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,</a>
<a id='line_493'>    Upon the desert slope is so impeded</a>
<a id='line_494'>    Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,</a>
<a id='line_495'></a>
<a id='line_496'>And may, I fear, already be so lost,</a>
<a id='line_497'>    That I too late have risen to his succour,</a>
<a id='line_498'>    From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.</a>
<a id='line_499'></a>
<a id='line_500'>Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,</a>
<a id='line_501'>    And with what needful is for his release,</a>
<a id='line_502'>    Assist him so, that I may be consoled.</a>
<a id='line_503'></a>
<a id='line_504'>Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;</a>
<a id='line_505'>    I come from there, where I would fain return;</a>
<a id='line_506'>    Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.</a>
<a id='line_507'></a>
<a id='line_508'>When I shall be in presence of my Lord,</a>
<a id='line_509'>    Full often will I praise thee unto him.’</a>
<a id='line_510'>    Then paused she, and thereafter I began:</a>
<a id='line_511'></a>
<a id='line_512'>‘O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom</a>
<a id='line_513'>    The human race exceedeth all contained</a>
<a id='line_514'>    Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,</a>
<a id='line_515'></a>
<a id='line_516'>So grateful unto me is thy commandment,</a>
<a id='line_517'>    To obey, if ’twere already done, were late;</a>
<a id='line_518'>    No farther need’st thou ope to me thy wish.</a>
<a id='line_519'></a>
<a id='line_520'>But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun</a>
<a id='line_521'>    The here descending down into this centre,</a>
<a id='line_522'>    From the vast place thou burnest to return to.’</a>
<a id='line_523'></a>
<a id='line_524'>‘Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,</a>
<a id='line_525'>    Briefly will I relate,’ she answered me,</a>
<a id='line_526'>    ‘Why I am not afraid to enter here.</a>
<a id='line_527'></a>
<a id='line_528'>Of those things only should one be afraid</a>
<a id='line_529'>    Which have the power of doing others harm;</a>
<a id='line_530'>    Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.</a>
<a id='line_531'></a>
<a id='line_532'>God in his mercy such created me</a>
<a id='line_533'>    That misery of yours attains me not,</a>
<a id='line_534'>    Nor any flame assails me of this burning.</a>
<a id='line_535'></a>
<a id='line_536'>A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves</a>
<a id='line_537'>    At this impediment, to which I send thee,</a>
<a id='line_538'>    So that stern judgment there above is broken.</a>
<a id='line_539'></a>
<a id='line_540'>In her entreaty she besought Lucia,</a>
<a id='line_541'>    And said, “Thy faithful one now stands in need</a>
<a id='line_542'>    Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him.”</a>
<a id='line_543'></a>
<a id='line_544'>Lucia, foe of all that cruel is,</a>
<a id='line_545'>    Hastened away, and came unto the place</a>
<a id='line_546'>    Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.</a>
<a id='line_547'></a>
<a id='line_548'>“Beatrice” said she, “the true praise of God,</a>
<a id='line_549'>    Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so,</a>
<a id='line_550'>    For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?</a>
<a id='line_551'></a>
<a id='line_552'>Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?</a>
<a id='line_553'>    Dost thou not see the death that combats him</a>
<a id='line_554'>    Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?”</a>
<a id='line_555'></a>
<a id='line_556'>Never were persons in the world so swift</a>
<a id='line_557'>    To work their weal and to escape their woe,</a>
<a id='line_558'>    As I, after such words as these were uttered,</a>
<a id='line_559'></a>
<a id='line_560'>Came hither downward from my blessed seat,</a>
<a id='line_561'>    Confiding in thy dignified discourse,</a>
<a id='line_562'>    Which honours thee, and those who’ve listened to it.’</a>
<a id='line_563'></a>
<a id='line_564'>After she thus had spoken unto me,</a>
<a id='line_565'>    Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;</a>
<a id='line_566'>    Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;</a>
<a id='line_567'></a>
<a id='line_568'>And unto thee I came, as she desired;</a>
<a id='line_569'>    I have delivered thee from that wild beast,</a>
<a id='line_570'>    Which barred the beautiful mountain’s short ascent.</a>
<a id='line_571'></a>
<a id='line_572'>What is it, then? Why, why dost thou delay?</a>
<a id='line_573'>    Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?</a>
<a id='line_574'>    Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,</a>
<a id='line_575'></a>
<a id='line_576'>Seeing that three such Ladies benedight</a>
<a id='line_577'>    Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,</a>
<a id='line_578'>    And so much good my speech doth promise thee?”</a>
<a id='line_579'></a>
<a id='line_580'>Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,</a>
<a id='line_581'>    Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,</a>
<a id='line_582'>    Uplift themselves all open on their stems;</a>
<a id='line_583'></a>
<a id='line_584'>Such I became with my exhausted strength,</a>
<a id='line_585'>    And such good courage to my heart there coursed,</a>
<a id='line_586'>    That I began, like an intrepid person:</a>
<a id='line_587'></a>
<a id='line_588'>“O she compassionate, who succoured me,</a>
<a id='line_589'>    And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon</a>
<a id='line_590'>    The words of truth which she addressed to thee!</a>
<a id='line_591'></a>
<a id='line_592'>Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed</a>
<a id='line_593'>    To the adventure, with these words of thine,</a>
<a id='line_594'>    That to my first intent I have returned.</a>
<a id='line_595'></a>
<a id='line_596'>Now go, for one sole will is in us both,</a>
<a id='line_597'>    Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou.”</a>
<a id='line_598'>    Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,</a>
<a id='line_599'></a>
<a id='line_600'>I entered on the deep and savage way.</a>
<a id='line_601'></a>

<a id='line_605'>Inferno: Canto III</a>

<a id='line_607'></a>
<a id='line_608'>“Through me the way is to the city dolent;</a>
<a id='line_609'>    Through me the way is to eternal dole;</a>

<a id='line_611'></a>
<a id='line_612'>Justice incited my sublime Creator;</a>

<a id='line_618'>    All hope abandon, ye who enter in!”</a>
<a id='line_619'></a>
<a id='line_620'>These words in sombre colour I beheld</a>
<a id='line_621'>    Written upon the summit of a gate;</a>
<a id='line_622'>    Whence I: “Their sense is, Master, hard to me!”</a>

<a id='line_624'>And he to me, as one experienced:</a>
<a id='line_625'>    “Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned,</a>

<a id='line_630'>    Who have foregone the good of intellect.”</a>
<a id='line_631'></a>
<a id='line_632'>And after he had laid his hand on mine</a>
<a id='line_633'>    With joyful mien, whence I was comforted,</a>
<a id='line_634'>    He led me in among the secret things.</a>
<a id='line_635'></a>
<a id='line_636'>There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud</a>
<a id='line_637'>    Resounded through the air without a star,</a>
<a id='line_638'>    Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat.</a>
<a id='line_639'></a>
<a id='line_640'>Languages diverse, horrible dialects,</a>
<a id='line_641'>    Accents of anger, words of agony,</a>
<a id='line_642'>    And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands,</a>
<a id='line_643'></a>
<a id='line_644'>Made up a tumult that goes whirling on</a>
<a id='line_645'>    For ever in that air for ever black,</a>
<a id='line_646'>    Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes.</a>
<a id='line_647'></a>
<a id='line_648'>And I, who had my head with horror bound,</a>
<a id='line_649'>    Said: “Master, what is this which now I hear?</a>
<a id='line_650'>    What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?”</a>
<a id='line_651'></a>
<a id='line_652'>And he to me: “This miserable mode</a>
<a id='line_653'>    Maintain the melancholy souls of those</a>
<a id='line_654'>    Who lived withouten infamy or praise.</a>
<a id='line_655'></a>
<a id='line_656'>Commingled are they with that caitiff choir</a>
<a id='line_657'>    Of Angels, who have not rebellious been,</a>
<a id='line_658'>    Nor faithful were to God, but were for self.</a>
<a id='line_659'></a>
<a id='line_660'>The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair;</a>
<a id='line_661'>    Nor them the nethermore abyss receives,</a>
<a id='line_662'>    For glory none the damned would have from them.”</a>
<a id='line_663'></a>
<a id='line_664'>And I: “O Master, what so grievous is</a>
<a id='line_665'>    To these, that maketh them lament so sore?”</a>
<a id='line_666'>    He answered: “I will tell thee very briefly.</a>
<a id='line_667'></a>
<a id='line_668'>These have no longer any hope of death;</a>
<a id='line_669'>    And this blind life of theirs is so debased,</a>
<a id='line_670'>    They envious are of every other fate.</a>
<a id='line_671'></a>
<a id='line_672'>No fame of them the world permits to be;</a>
<a id='line_673'>    Misericord and Justice both disdain them.</a>
<a id='line_674'>    Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass.”</a>
<a id='line_675'></a>
<a id='line_676'>And I, who looked again, beheld a banner,</a>
<a id='line_677'>    Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly,</a>
<a id='line_678'>    That of all pause it seemed to me indignant;</a>
<a id='line_679'></a>
<a id='line_680'>And after it there came so long a train</a>
<a id='line_681'>    Of people, that I ne’er would have believed</a>
<a id='line_682'>    That ever Death so many had undone.</a>
<a id='line_683'></a>
<a id='line_684'>When some among them I had recognised,</a>
<a id='line_685'>    I looked, and I beheld the shade of him</a>
<a id='line_686'>    Who made through cowardice the great refusal.</a>
<a id='line_687'></a>
<a id='line_688'>Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,</a>
<a id='line_689'>    That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches</a>
<a id='line_690'>    Hateful to God and to his enemies.</a>
<a id='line_691'></a>
<a id='line_692'>These miscreants, who never were alive,</a>
<a id='line_693'>    Were naked, and were stung exceedingly</a>
<a id='line_694'>    By gadflies and by hornets that were there.</a>
<a id='line_695'></a>
<a id='line_696'>These did their faces irrigate with blood,</a>
<a id='line_697'>    Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet</a>
<a id='line_698'>    By the disgusting worms was gathered up.</a>
<a id='line_699'></a>
<a id='line_700'>And when to gazing farther I betook me.</a>
<a id='line_701'>    People I saw on a great river’s bank;</a>
<a id='line_702'>    Whence said I: “Master, now vouchsafe to me,</a>
<a id='line_703'></a>
<a id='line_704'>That I may know who these are, and what law</a>
<a id='line_705'>    Makes them appear so ready to pass over,</a>
<a id='line_706'>    As I discern athwart the dusky light.”</a>
<a id='line_707'></a>
<a id='line_708'>And he to me: “These things shall all be known</a>
<a id='line_709'>    To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay</a>
<a id='line_710'>    Upon the dismal shore of Acheron.”</a>
<a id='line_711'></a>
<a id='line_712'>Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,</a>
<a id='line_713'>    Fearing my words might irksome be to him,</a>
<a id='line_714'>    From speech refrained I till we reached the river.</a>
<a id='line_715'></a>
<a id='line_716'>And lo! towards us coming in a boat</a>
<a id='line_717'>    An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,</a>
<a id='line_718'>    Crying: “Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!</a>
<a id='line_719'></a>
<a id='line_720'>Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;</a>
<a id='line_721'>    I come to lead you to the other shore,</a>
<a id='line_722'>    To the eternal shades in heat and frost.</a>
<a id='line_723'></a>
<a id='line_724'>And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,</a>
<a id='line_725'>    Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!”</a>
<a id='line_726'>    But when he saw that I did not withdraw,</a>
<a id='line_727'></a>
<a id='line_728'>He said: “By other ways, by other ports</a>
<a id='line_729'>    Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;</a>
<a id='line_730'>    A lighter vessel needs must carry thee.”</a>
<a id='line_731'></a>
<a id='line_732'>And unto him the Guide: “Vex thee not, Charon;</a>
<a id='line_733'>    It is so willed there where is power to do</a>
<a id='line_734'>    That which is willed; and farther question not.”</a>
<a id='line_735'></a>
<a id='line_736'>Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks</a>
<a id='line_737'>    Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,</a>
<a id='line_738'>    Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.</a>
<a id='line_739'></a>
<a id='line_740'>But all those souls who weary were and naked</a>
<a id='line_741'>    Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together,</a>
<a id='line_742'>    As soon as they had heard those cruel words.</a>
<a id='line_743'></a>
<a id='line_744'>God they blasphemed and their progenitors,</a>
<a id='line_745'>    The human race, the place, the time, the seed</a>
<a id='line_746'>    Of their engendering and of their birth!</a>
<a id='line_747'></a>
<a id='line_748'>Thereafter all together they drew back,</a>
<a id='line_749'>    Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,</a>
<a id='line_750'>    Which waiteth every man who fears not God.</a>
<a id='line_751'></a>
<a id='line_752'>Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,</a>
<a id='line_753'>    Beckoning to them, collects them all together,</a>
<a id='line_754'>    Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.</a>
<a id='line_755'></a>
<a id='line_756'>As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,</a>
<a id='line_757'>    First one and then another, till the branch</a>
<a id='line_758'>    Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;</a>
<a id='line_759'></a>
<a id='line_760'>In similar wise the evil seed of Adam</a>
<a id='line_761'>    Throw themselves from that margin one by one,</a>
<a id='line_762'>    At signals, as a bird unto its lure.</a>
<a id='line_763'></a>
<a id='line_764'>So they depart across the dusky wave,</a>
<a id='line_765'>    And ere upon the other side they land,</a>
<a id='line_766'>    Again on this side a new troop assembles.</a>
<a id='line_767'></a>
<a id='line_768'>“My son,” the courteous Master said to me,</a>
<a id='line_769'>    “All those who perish in the wrath of God</a>
<a id='line_770'>    Here meet together out of every land;</a>
<a id='line_771'></a>
<a id='line_772'>And ready are they to pass o’er the river,</a>
<a id='line_773'>    Because celestial Justice spurs them on,</a>
<a id='line_774'>    So that their fear is turned into desire.</a>
<a id='line_775'></a>
<a id='line_776'>This way there never passes a good soul;</a>
<a id='line_777'>    And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,</a>
<a id='line_778'>    Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports.”</a>
<a id='line_779'></a>
<a id='line_780'>This being finished, all the dusk champaign</a>
<a id='line_781'>    Trembled so violently, that of that terror</a>
<a id='line_782'>    The recollection bathes me still with sweat.</a>
<a id='line_783'></a>
<a id='line_784'>The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,</a>
<a id='line_785'>    And fulminated a vermilion light,</a>
<a id='line_786'>    Which overmastered in me every sense,</a>
<a id='line_787'></a>
<a id='line_788'>And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.</a>
<a id='line_789'></a>
<a id='line_790'></a>
<a id='line_791'></a>
<a id='line_792'></a>
<a id='line_793'>Inferno: Canto IV</a>
<a id='line_794'></a>
<a id='line_795'></a>
<a id='line_796'>Broke the deep lethargy within my head</a>
<a id='line_797'>    A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,</a>
<a id='line_798'>    Like to a person who by force is wakened;</a>
<a id='line_799'></a>
<a id='line_800'>And round about I moved my rested eyes,</a>
<a id='line_801'>    Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,</a>
<a id='line_802'>    To recognise the place wherein I was.</a>
<a id='line_803'></a>
<a id='line_804'>True is it, that upon the verge I found me</a>
<a id='line_805'>    Of the abysmal valley dolorous,</a>
<a id='line_806'>    That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.</a>
<a id='line_807'></a>
<a id='line_808'>Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,</a>
<a id='line_809'>    So that by fixing on its depths my sight</a>
<a id='line_810'>    Nothing whatever I discerned therein.</a>
<a id='line_811'></a>
<a id='line_812'>“Let us descend now into the blind world,”</a>
<a id='line_813'>    Began the Poet, pallid utterly;</a>
<a id='line_814'>    “I will be first, and thou shalt second be.”</a>
<a id='line_815'></a>
<a id='line_816'>And I, who of his colour was aware,</a>
<a id='line_817'>    Said: “How shall I come, if thou art afraid,</a>
<a id='line_818'>    Who’rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?”</a>
<a id='line_819'></a>
<a id='line_820'>And he to me: “The anguish of the people</a>
<a id='line_821'>    Who are below here in my face depicts</a>
<a id='line_822'>    That pity which for terror thou hast taken.</a>
<a id='line_823'></a>
<a id='line_824'>Let us go on, for the long way impels us.”</a>
<a id='line_825'>    Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter</a>
<a id='line_826'>    The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.</a>
<a id='line_827'></a>
<a id='line_828'>There, as it seemed to me from listening,</a>
<a id='line_829'>    Were lamentations none, but only sighs,</a>
<a id='line_830'>    That tremble made the everlasting air.</a>
<a id='line_831'></a>
<a id='line_832'>And this arose from sorrow without torment,</a>
<a id='line_833'>    Which the crowds had, that many were and great,</a>
<a id='line_834'>    Of infants and of women and of men.</a>
<a id='line_835'></a>
<a id='line_836'>To me the Master good: “Thou dost not ask</a>
<a id='line_837'>    What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?</a>
<a id='line_838'>    Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,</a>
<a id='line_839'></a>
<a id='line_840'>That they sinned not; and if they merit had,</a>
<a id='line_841'>    ’Tis not enough, because they had not baptism</a>
<a id='line_842'>    Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;</a>
<a id='line_843'></a>
<a id='line_844'>And if they were before Christianity,</a>
<a id='line_845'>    In the right manner they adored not God;</a>
<a id='line_846'>    And among such as these am I myself.</a>
<a id='line_847'></a>
<a id='line_848'>For such defects, and not for other guilt,</a>
<a id='line_849'>    Lost are we and are only so far punished,</a>
<a id='line_850'>    That without hope we live on in desire.”</a>
<a id='line_851'></a>
<a id='line_852'>Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard,</a>
<a id='line_853'>    Because some people of much worthiness</a>
<a id='line_854'>    I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.</a>
<a id='line_855'></a>
<a id='line_856'>“Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,”</a>
<a id='line_857'>    Began I, with desire of being certain</a>
<a id='line_858'>    Of that Faith which o’ercometh every error,</a>
<a id='line_859'></a>
<a id='line_860'>“Came any one by his own merit hence,</a>
<a id='line_861'>    Or by another’s, who was blessed thereafter?”</a>
<a id='line_862'>    And he, who understood my covert speech,</a>
<a id='line_863'></a>
<a id='line_864'>Replied: “I was a novice in this state,</a>
<a id='line_865'>    When I saw hither come a Mighty One,</a>
<a id='line_866'>    With sign of victory incoronate.</a>
<a id='line_867'></a>
<a id='line_868'>Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,</a>
<a id='line_869'>    And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,</a>
<a id='line_870'>    Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient</a>
<a id='line_871'></a>
<a id='line_872'>Abraham, patriarch, and David, king,</a>
<a id='line_873'>    Israel with his father and his children,</a>
<a id='line_874'>    And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,</a>
<a id='line_875'></a>
<a id='line_876'>And others many, and he made them blessed;</a>
<a id='line_877'>    And thou must know, that earlier than these</a>
<a id='line_878'>    Never were any human spirits saved.”</a>
<a id='line_879'></a>
<a id='line_880'>We ceased not to advance because he spake,</a>
<a id='line_881'>    But still were passing onward through the forest,</a>
<a id='line_882'>    The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.</a>
<a id='line_883'></a>
<a id='line_884'>Not very far as yet our way had gone</a>
<a id='line_885'>    This side the summit, when I saw a fire</a>
<a id='line_886'>    That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.</a>
<a id='line_887'></a>
<a id='line_888'>We were a little distant from it still,</a>
<a id='line_889'>    But not so far that I in part discerned not</a>
<a id='line_890'>    That honourable people held that place.</a>
<a id='line_891'></a>
<a id='line_892'>“O thou who honourest every art and science,</a>
<a id='line_893'>    Who may these be, which such great honour have,</a>
<a id='line_894'>    That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?”</a>
<a id='line_895'></a>
<a id='line_896'>And he to me: “The honourable name,</a>
<a id='line_897'>    That sounds of them above there in thy life,</a>
<a id='line_898'>    Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them.”</a>
<a id='line_899'></a>
<a id='line_900'>In the mean time a voice was heard by me:</a>
<a id='line_901'>    “All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet;</a>
<a id='line_902'>    His shade returns again, that was departed.”</a>
<a id='line_903'></a>
<a id='line_904'>After the voice had ceased and quiet was,</a>
<a id='line_905'>    Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;</a>
<a id='line_906'>    Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.</a>
<a id='line_907'></a>
<a id='line_908'>To say to me began my gracious Master:</a>
<a id='line_909'>    “Him with that falchion in his hand behold,</a>
<a id='line_910'>    Who comes before the three, even as their lord.</a>
<a id='line_911'></a>
<a id='line_912'>That one is Homer, Poet sovereign;</a>
<a id='line_913'>    He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;</a>
<a id='line_914'>    The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.</a>
<a id='line_915'></a>
<a id='line_916'>Because to each of these with me applies</a>
<a id='line_917'>    The name that solitary voice proclaimed,</a>
<a id='line_918'>    They do me honour, and in that do well.”</a>
<a id='line_919'></a>
<a id='line_920'>Thus I beheld assemble the fair school</a>
<a id='line_921'>    Of that lord of the song pre-eminent,</a>
<a id='line_922'>    Who o’er the others like an eagle soars.</a>
<a id='line_923'></a>
<a id='line_924'>When they together had discoursed somewhat,</a>
<a id='line_925'>    They turned to me with signs of salutation,</a>
<a id='line_926'>    And on beholding this, my Master smiled;</a>
<a id='line_927'></a>
<a id='line_928'>And more of honour still, much more, they did me,</a>
<a id='line_929'>    In that they made me one of their own band;</a>
<a id='line_930'>    So that the sixth was I, ’mid so much wit.</a>
<a id='line_931'></a>
<a id='line_932'>Thus we went on as far as to the light,</a>
<a id='line_933'>    Things saying ’tis becoming to keep silent,</a>
<a id='line_934'>    As was the saying of them where I was.</a>
<a id='line_935'></a>
<a id='line_936'>We came unto a noble castle’s foot,</a>
<a id='line_937'>    Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,</a>
<a id='line_938'>    Defended round by a fair rivulet;</a>
<a id='line_939'></a>
<a id='line_940'>This we passed over even as firm ground;</a>
<a id='line_941'>    Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;</a>
<a id='line_942'>    We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.</a>
<a id='line_943'></a>
<a id='line_944'>People were there with solemn eyes and slow,</a>
<a id='line_945'>    Of great authority in their countenance;</a>
<a id='line_946'>    They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.</a>
<a id='line_947'></a>
<a id='line_948'>Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side</a>
<a id='line_949'>    Into an opening luminous and lofty,</a>
<a id='line_950'>    So that they all of them were visible.</a>
<a id='line_951'></a>
<a id='line_952'>There opposite, upon the green enamel,</a>
<a id='line_953'>    Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,</a>
<a id='line_954'>    Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.</a>
<a id='line_955'></a>
<a id='line_956'>I saw Electra with companions many,</a>
<a id='line_957'>    ’Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,</a>
<a id='line_958'>    Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes;</a>
<a id='line_959'></a>
<a id='line_960'>I saw Camilla and Penthesilea</a>
<a id='line_961'>    On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,</a>
<a id='line_962'>    Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;</a>
<a id='line_963'></a>
<a id='line_964'>I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,</a>
<a id='line_965'>    Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,</a>
<a id='line_966'>    And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.</a>
<a id='line_967'></a>
<a id='line_968'>When I had lifted up my brows a little,</a>
<a id='line_969'>    The Master I beheld of those who know,</a>
<a id='line_970'>    Sit with his philosophic family.</a>
<a id='line_971'></a>
<a id='line_972'>All gaze upon him, and all do him honour.</a>
<a id='line_973'>    There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,</a>
<a id='line_974'>    Who nearer him before the others stand;</a>
<a id='line_975'></a>
<a id='line_976'>Democritus, who puts the world on chance,</a>
<a id='line_977'>    Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,</a>
<a id='line_978'>    Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;</a>
<a id='line_979'></a>
<a id='line_980'>Of qualities I saw the good collector,</a>
<a id='line_981'>    Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,</a>
<a id='line_982'>    Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,</a>
<a id='line_983'></a>
<a id='line_984'>Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,</a>
<a id='line_985'>    Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,</a>
<a id='line_986'>    Averroes, who the great Comment made.</a>
<a id='line_987'></a>
<a id='line_988'>I cannot all of them pourtray in full,</a>
<a id='line_989'>    Because so drives me onward the long theme,</a>
<a id='line_990'>    That many times the word comes short of fact.</a>
<a id='line_991'></a>
<a id='line_992'>The sixfold company in two divides;</a>
<a id='line_993'>    Another way my sapient Guide conducts me</a>
<a id='line_994'>    Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;</a>
<a id='line_995'></a>
<a id='line_996'>And to a place I come where nothing shines.</a>
<a id='line_997'></a>
<a id='line_998'></a>
<a id='line_999'></a>
<a id='line_1000'></a>
<a id='line_1001'>Inferno: Canto V</a>
<a id='line_1002'></a>
<a id='line_1003'></a>
<a id='line_1004'>Thus I descended out of the first circle</a>
<a id='line_1005'>    Down to the second, that less space begirds,</a>
<a id='line_1006'>    And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing.</a>
<a id='line_1007'></a>
<a id='line_1008'>There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls;</a>

<a id='line_1010'>    Judges, and sends according as he girds him.</a>
<a id='line_1011'></a>
<a id='line_1012'>I say, that when the spirit evil-born</a>
<a id='line_1013'>    Cometh before him, wholly it confesses;</a>
<a id='line_1014'>    And this discriminator of transgressions</a>

<a id='line_1019'></a>
<a id='line_1020'>Always before him many of them stand;</a>
<a id='line_1021'>    They go by turns each one unto the judgment;</a>
<a id='line_1022'>    They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled.</a>
<a id='line_1023'></a>
<a id='line_1024'>“O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry</a>
<a id='line_1025'>    Comest,” said Minos to me, when he saw me,</a>
<a id='line_1026'>    Leaving the practice of so great an office,</a>
<a id='line_1027'></a>
<a id='line_1028'>“Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest;</a>
<a id='line_1029'>    Let not the portal’s amplitude deceive thee.”</a>
<a id='line_1030'>    And unto him my Guide: “Why criest thou too?</a>
<a id='line_1031'></a>
<a id='line_1032'>Do not impede his journey fate-ordained;</a>
<a id='line_1033'>    It is so willed there where is power to do</a>
<a id='line_1034'>    That which is willed; and ask no further question.”</a>
<a id='line_1035'></a>
<a id='line_1036'>And now begin the dolesome notes to grow</a>
<a id='line_1037'>    Audible unto me; now am I come</a>
<a id='line_1038'>    There where much lamentation strikes upon me.</a>
<a id='line_1039'></a>
<a id='line_1040'>I came into a place mute of all light,</a>
<a id='line_1041'>    Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,</a>
<a id='line_1042'>    If by opposing winds ’t is combated.</a>
<a id='line_1043'></a>
<a id='line_1044'>The infernal hurricane that never rests</a>
<a id='line_1045'>    Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;</a>
<a id='line_1046'>    Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.</a>
<a id='line_1047'></a>
<a id='line_1048'>When they arrive before the precipice,</a>
<a id='line_1049'>    There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,</a>
<a id='line_1050'>    There they blaspheme the puissance divine.</a>
<a id='line_1051'></a>
<a id='line_1052'>I understood that unto such a torment</a>
<a id='line_1053'>    The carnal malefactors were condemned,</a>
<a id='line_1054'>    Who reason subjugate to appetite.</a>
<a id='line_1055'></a>
<a id='line_1056'>And as the wings of starlings bear them on</a>
<a id='line_1057'>    In the cold season in large band and full,</a>
<a id='line_1058'>    So doth that blast the spirits maledict;</a>
<a id='line_1059'></a>
<a id='line_1060'>It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;</a>
<a id='line_1061'>    No hope doth comfort them for evermore,</a>
<a id='line_1062'>    Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.</a>
<a id='line_1063'></a>
<a id='line_1064'>And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,</a>
<a id='line_1065'>    Making in air a long line of themselves,</a>
<a id='line_1066'>    So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,</a>
<a id='line_1067'></a>
<a id='line_1068'>Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.</a>
<a id='line_1069'>    Whereupon said I: “Master, who are those</a>
<a id='line_1070'>    People, whom the black air so castigates?”</a>
<a id='line_1071'></a>
<a id='line_1072'>“The first of those, of whom intelligence</a>
<a id='line_1073'>    Thou fain wouldst have,” then said he unto me,</a>
<a id='line_1074'>    “The empress was of many languages.</a>
<a id='line_1075'></a>
<a id='line_1076'>To sensual vices she was so abandoned,</a>
<a id='line_1077'>    That lustful she made licit in her law,</a>
<a id='line_1078'>    To remove the blame to which she had been led.</a>
<a id='line_1079'></a>
<a id='line_1080'>She is Semiramis, of whom we read</a>
<a id='line_1081'>    That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;</a>
<a id='line_1082'>    She held the land which now the Sultan rules.</a>
<a id='line_1083'></a>
<a id='line_1084'>The next is she who killed herself for love,</a>
<a id='line_1085'>    And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus;</a>
<a id='line_1086'>    Then Cleopatra the voluptuous.”</a>
<a id='line_1087'></a>
<a id='line_1088'>Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless</a>
<a id='line_1089'>    Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,</a>
<a id='line_1090'>    Who at the last hour combated with Love.</a>
<a id='line_1091'></a>
<a id='line_1092'>Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand</a>
<a id='line_1093'>    Shades did he name and point out with his finger,</a>
<a id='line_1094'>    Whom Love had separated from our life.</a>
<a id='line_1095'></a>
<a id='line_1096'>After that I had listened to my Teacher,</a>
<a id='line_1097'>    Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,</a>
<a id='line_1098'>    Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.</a>
<a id='line_1099'></a>
<a id='line_1100'>And I began: “O Poet, willingly</a>
<a id='line_1101'>    Speak would I to those two, who go together,</a>
<a id='line_1102'>    And seem upon the wind to be so light.”</a>
<a id='line_1103'></a>
<a id='line_1104'>And, he to me: “Thou’lt mark, when they shall be</a>
<a id='line_1105'>    Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them</a>
<a id='line_1106'>    By love which leadeth them, and they will come.”</a>
<a id='line_1107'></a>
<a id='line_1108'>Soon as the wind in our direction sways them,</a>
<a id='line_1109'>    My voice uplift I: “O ye weary souls!</a>
<a id='line_1110'>    Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it.”</a>
<a id='line_1111'></a>
<a id='line_1112'>As turtle-doves, called onward by desire,</a>
<a id='line_1113'>    With open and steady wings to the sweet nest</a>
<a id='line_1114'>    Fly through the air by their volition borne,</a>
<a id='line_1115'></a>
<a id='line_1116'>So came they from the band where Dido is,</a>
<a id='line_1117'>    Approaching us athwart the air malign,</a>
<a id='line_1118'>    So strong was the affectionate appeal.</a>
<a id='line_1119'></a>
<a id='line_1120'>“O living creature gracious and benignant,</a>
<a id='line_1121'>    Who visiting goest through the purple air</a>
<a id='line_1122'>    Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,</a>
<a id='line_1123'></a>
<a id='line_1124'>If were the King of the Universe our friend,</a>
<a id='line_1125'>    We would pray unto him to give thee peace,</a>
<a id='line_1126'>    Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.</a>
<a id='line_1127'></a>
<a id='line_1128'>Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,</a>
<a id='line_1129'>    That will we hear, and we will speak to you,</a>
<a id='line_1130'>    While silent is the wind, as it is now.</a>
<a id='line_1131'></a>
<a id='line_1132'>Sitteth the city, wherein I was born,</a>
<a id='line_1133'>    Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends</a>
<a id='line_1134'>    To rest in peace with all his retinue.</a>
<a id='line_1135'></a>
<a id='line_1136'>Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,</a>
<a id='line_1137'>    Seized this man for the person beautiful</a>
<a id='line_1138'>    That was ta’en from me, and still the mode offends me.</a>
<a id='line_1139'></a>
<a id='line_1140'>Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,</a>
<a id='line_1141'>    Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,</a>
<a id='line_1142'>    That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;</a>
<a id='line_1143'></a>
<a id='line_1144'>Love has conducted us unto one death;</a>
<a id='line_1145'>    Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!”</a>
<a id='line_1146'>    These words were borne along from them to us.</a>
<a id='line_1147'></a>
<a id='line_1148'>As soon as I had heard those souls tormented,</a>
<a id='line_1149'>    I bowed my face, and so long held it down</a>
<a id='line_1150'>    Until the Poet said to me: “What thinkest?”</a>
<a id='line_1151'></a>
<a id='line_1152'>When I made answer, I began: “Alas!</a>
<a id='line_1153'>    How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,</a>
<a id='line_1154'>    Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!”</a>
<a id='line_1155'></a>
<a id='line_1156'>Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,</a>
<a id='line_1157'>    And I began: “Thine agonies, Francesca,</a>
<a id='line_1158'>    Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.</a>
<a id='line_1159'></a>
<a id='line_1160'>But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,</a>
<a id='line_1161'>    By what and in what manner Love conceded,</a>
<a id='line_1162'>    That you should know your dubious desires?”</a>
<a id='line_1163'></a>
<a id='line_1164'>And she to me: “There is no greater sorrow</a>
<a id='line_1165'>    Than to be mindful of the happy time</a>
<a id='line_1166'>    In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.</a>
<a id='line_1167'></a>
<a id='line_1168'>But, if to recognise the earliest root</a>
<a id='line_1169'>    Of love in us thou hast so great desire,</a>
<a id='line_1170'>    I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.</a>
<a id='line_1171'></a>
<a id='line_1172'>One day we reading were for our delight</a>
<a id='line_1173'>    Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral.</a>
<a id='line_1174'>    Alone we were and without any fear.</a>
<a id='line_1175'></a>
<a id='line_1176'>Full many a time our eyes together drew</a>
<a id='line_1177'>    That reading, and drove the colour from our faces;</a>
<a id='line_1178'>    But one point only was it that o’ercame us.</a>
<a id='line_1179'></a>
<a id='line_1180'>When as we read of the much-longed-for smile</a>
<a id='line_1181'>    Being by such a noble lover kissed,</a>
<a id='line_1182'>    This one, who ne’er from me shall be divided,</a>
<a id='line_1183'></a>
<a id='line_1184'>Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.</a>
<a id='line_1185'>    Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.</a>
<a id='line_1186'>    That day no farther did we read therein.”</a>
<a id='line_1187'></a>
<a id='line_1188'>And all the while one spirit uttered this,</a>
<a id='line_1189'>    The other one did weep so, that, for pity,</a>
<a id='line_1190'>    I swooned away as if I had been dying,</a>
<a id='line_1191'></a>
<a id='line_1192'>And fell, even as a dead body falls.</a>
<a id='line_1193'></a>
<a id='line_1194'></a>
<a id='line_1195'></a>
<a id='line_1196'></a>
<a id='line_1197'>Inferno: Canto VI</a>
<a id='line_1198'></a>
<a id='line_1199'></a>
<a id='line_1200'>At the return of consciousness, that closed</a>
<a id='line_1201'>    Before the pity of those two relations,</a>
<a id='line_1202'>    Which utterly with sadness had confused me,</a>
<a id='line_1203'></a>
<a id='line_1204'>New torments I behold, and new tormented</a>
<a id='line_1205'>    Around me, whichsoever way I move,</a>
<a id='line_1206'>    And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.</a>
<a id='line_1207'></a>
<a id='line_1208'>In the third circle am I of the rain</a>
<a id='line_1209'>    Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;</a>
<a id='line_1210'>    Its law and quality are never new.</a>
<a id='line_1211'></a>
<a id='line_1212'>Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,</a>
<a id='line_1213'>    Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;</a>
<a id='line_1214'>    Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.</a>
<a id='line_1215'></a>
<a id='line_1216'>Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,</a>
<a id='line_1217'>    With his three gullets like a dog is barking</a>
<a id='line_1218'>    Over the people that are there submerged.</a>
<a id='line_1219'></a>
<a id='line_1220'>Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,</a>
<a id='line_1221'>    And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;</a>
<a id='line_1222'>    He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.</a>
<a id='line_1223'></a>
<a id='line_1224'>Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;</a>
<a id='line_1225'>    One side they make a shelter for the other;</a>
<a id='line_1226'>    Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.</a>
<a id='line_1227'></a>
<a id='line_1228'>When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!</a>
<a id='line_1229'>     His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;</a>
<a id='line_1230'>     Not a limb had he that was motionless.</a>
<a id='line_1231'></a>
<a id='line_1232'>And my Conductor, with his spans extended,</a>
<a id='line_1233'>    Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,</a>
<a id='line_1234'>    He threw it into those rapacious gullets.</a>
<a id='line_1235'></a>
<a id='line_1236'>Such as that dog is, who by barking craves,</a>
<a id='line_1237'>    And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,</a>
<a id='line_1238'>    For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,</a>
<a id='line_1239'></a>
<a id='line_1240'>The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed</a>
<a id='line_1241'>    Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders</a>
<a id='line_1242'>    Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.</a>
<a id='line_1243'></a>
<a id='line_1244'>We passed across the shadows, which subdues</a>
<a id='line_1245'>    The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet</a>
<a id='line_1246'>    Upon their vanity that person seems.</a>
<a id='line_1247'></a>
<a id='line_1248'>They all were lying prone upon the earth,</a>
<a id='line_1249'>    Excepting one, who sat upright as soon</a>
<a id='line_1250'>    As he beheld us passing on before him.</a>
<a id='line_1251'></a>
<a id='line_1252'>“O thou that art conducted through this Hell,”</a>
<a id='line_1253'>    He said to me, “recall me, if thou canst;</a>
<a id='line_1254'>    Thyself wast made before I was unmade.”</a>
<a id='line_1255'></a>
<a id='line_1256'>And I to him: “The anguish which thou hast</a>
<a id='line_1257'>    Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,</a>
<a id='line_1258'>    So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.</a>
<a id='line_1259'></a>
<a id='line_1260'>But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful</a>
<a id='line_1261'>    A place art put, and in such punishment,</a>
<a id='line_1262'>    If some are greater, none is so displeasing.”</a>
<a id='line_1263'></a>
<a id='line_1264'>And he to me: “Thy city, which is full</a>
<a id='line_1265'>    Of envy so that now the sack runs over,</a>
<a id='line_1266'>    Held me within it in the life serene.</a>
<a id='line_1267'></a>
<a id='line_1268'>You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;</a>
<a id='line_1269'>    For the pernicious sin of gluttony</a>
<a id='line_1270'>    I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.</a>
<a id='line_1271'></a>
<a id='line_1272'>And I, sad soul, am not the only one,</a>
<a id='line_1273'>    For all these suffer the like penalty</a>
<a id='line_1274'>    For the like sin;” and word no more spake he.</a>
<a id='line_1275'></a>
<a id='line_1276'>I answered him: “Ciacco, thy wretchedness</a>
<a id='line_1277'>    Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;</a>
<a id='line_1278'>    But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come</a>
<a id='line_1279'></a>
<a id='line_1280'>The citizens of the divided city;</a>
<a id='line_1281'>    If any there be just; and the occasion</a>
<a id='line_1282'>    Tell me why so much discord has assailed it.”</a>
<a id='line_1283'></a>
<a id='line_1284'>And he to me: “They, after long contention,</a>
<a id='line_1285'>    Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party</a>
<a id='line_1286'>    Will drive the other out with much offence.</a>
<a id='line_1287'></a>
<a id='line_1288'>Then afterwards behoves it this one fall</a>
<a id='line_1289'>    Within three suns, and rise again the other</a>
<a id='line_1290'>    By force of him who now is on the coast.</a>
<a id='line_1291'></a>
<a id='line_1292'>High will it hold its forehead a long while,</a>
<a id='line_1293'>    Keeping the other under heavy burdens,</a>
<a id='line_1294'>    Howe’er it weeps thereat and is indignant.</a>
<a id='line_1295'></a>
<a id='line_1296'>The just are two, and are not understood there;</a>
<a id='line_1297'>    Envy and Arrogance and Avarice</a>
<a id='line_1298'>    Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled.”</a>
<a id='line_1299'></a>
<a id='line_1300'>Here ended he his tearful utterance;</a>
<a id='line_1301'>    And I to him: “I wish thee still to teach me,</a>
<a id='line_1302'>    And make a gift to me of further speech.</a>
<a id='line_1303'></a>
<a id='line_1304'>Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,</a>
<a id='line_1305'>    Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,</a>
<a id='line_1306'>    And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,</a>
<a id='line_1307'></a>
<a id='line_1308'>Say where they are, and cause that I may know them;</a>
<a id='line_1309'>    For great desire constraineth me to learn</a>
<a id='line_1310'>    If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom.”</a>
<a id='line_1311'></a>
<a id='line_1312'>And he: “They are among the blacker souls;</a>
<a id='line_1313'>    A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;</a>
<a id='line_1314'>    If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.</a>
<a id='line_1315'></a>
<a id='line_1316'>But when thou art again in the sweet world,</a>
<a id='line_1317'>    I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;</a>
<a id='line_1318'>    No more I tell thee and no more I answer.”</a>
<a id='line_1319'></a>
<a id='line_1320'>Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance,</a>
<a id='line_1321'>    Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;</a>
<a id='line_1322'>    He fell therewith prone like the other blind.</a>
<a id='line_1323'></a>
<a id='line_1324'>And the Guide said to me: “He wakes no more</a>
<a id='line_1325'>    This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;</a>
<a id='line_1326'>    When shall approach the hostile Potentate,</a>
<a id='line_1327'></a>
<a id='line_1328'>Each one shall find again his dismal tomb,</a>
<a id='line_1329'>    Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,</a>
<a id='line_1330'>    Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes.”</a>
<a id='line_1331'></a>
<a id='line_1332'>So we passed onward o’er the filthy mixture</a>
<a id='line_1333'>    Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,</a>
<a id='line_1334'>    Touching a little on the future life.</a>
<a id='line_1335'></a>
<a id='line_1336'>Wherefore I said: “Master, these torments here,</a>
<a id='line_1337'>    Will they increase after the mighty sentence,</a>
<a id='line_1338'>    Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?”</a>
<a id='line_1339'></a>
<a id='line_1340'>And he to me: “Return unto thy science,</a>
<a id='line_1341'>    Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is,</a>
<a id='line_1342'>    The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.</a>
<a id='line_1343'></a>
<a id='line_1344'>Albeit that this people maledict</a>
<a id='line_1345'>    To true perfection never can attain,</a>
<a id='line_1346'>    Hereafter more than now they look to be.”</a>
<a id='line_1347'></a>
<a id='line_1348'>Round in a circle by that road we went,</a>
<a id='line_1349'>    Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;</a>
<a id='line_1350'>    We came unto the point where the descent is;</a>
<a id='line_1351'></a>
<a id='line_1352'>There we found Plutus the great enemy.</a>
<a id='line_1353'></a>
<a id='line_1354'></a>
<a id='line_1355'></a>
<a id='line_1356'></a>
<a id='line_1357'>Inferno: Canto VII</a>
<a id='line_1358'></a>
<a id='line_1359'></a>
<a id='line_1360'>“Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!”</a>
<a id='line_1361'>    Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began;</a>
<a id='line_1362'>    And that benignant Sage, who all things knew,</a>
<a id='line_1363'></a>
<a id='line_1364'>Said, to encourage me: “Let not thy fear</a>
<a id='line_1365'>    Harm thee; for any power that he may have</a>
<a id='line_1366'>    Shall not prevent thy going down this crag.”</a>
<a id='line_1367'></a>
<a id='line_1368'>Then he turned round unto that bloated lip,</a>
<a id='line_1369'>    And said: “Be silent, thou accursed wolf;</a>
<a id='line_1370'>    Consume within thyself with thine own rage.</a>
<a id='line_1371'></a>
<a id='line_1372'>Not causeless is this journey to the abyss;</a>
<a id='line_1373'>    Thus is it willed on high, where Michael wrought</a>
<a id='line_1374'>    Vengeance upon the proud adultery.”</a>
<a id='line_1375'></a>
<a id='line_1376'>Even as the sails inflated by the wind</a>
<a id='line_1377'>    Involved together fall when snaps the mast,</a>
<a id='line_1378'>    So fell the cruel monster to the earth.</a>
<a id='line_1379'></a>
<a id='line_1380'>Thus we descended into the fourth chasm,</a>
<a id='line_1381'>    Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore</a>
<a id='line_1382'>    Which all the woe of the universe insacks.</a>
<a id='line_1383'></a>
<a id='line_1384'>Justice of God, ah! who heaps up so many</a>
<a id='line_1385'>    New toils and sufferings as I beheld?</a>
<a id='line_1386'>    And why doth our transgression waste us so?</a>
<a id='line_1387'></a>
<a id='line_1388'>As doth the billow there upon Charybdis,</a>
<a id='line_1389'>    That breaks itself on that which it encounters,</a>
<a id='line_1390'>    So here the folk must dance their roundelay.</a>
<a id='line_1391'></a>
<a id='line_1392'>Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many,</a>
<a id='line_1393'>    On one side and the other, with great howls,</a>
<a id='line_1394'>    Rolling weights forward by main force of chest.</a>
<a id='line_1395'></a>
<a id='line_1396'>They clashed together, and then at that point</a>
<a id='line_1397'>    Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,</a>
<a id='line_1398'>    Crying, “Why keepest?” and, “Why squanderest thou?”</a>
<a id='line_1399'></a>
<a id='line_1400'>Thus they returned along the lurid circle</a>
<a id='line_1401'>    On either hand unto the opposite point,</a>
<a id='line_1402'>    Shouting their shameful metre evermore.</a>
<a id='line_1403'></a>
<a id='line_1404'>Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about</a>
<a id='line_1405'>    Through his half-circle to another joust;</a>
<a id='line_1406'>    And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,</a>
<a id='line_1407'></a>
<a id='line_1408'>Exclaimed: “My Master, now declare to me</a>
<a id='line_1409'>    What people these are, and if all were clerks,</a>
<a id='line_1410'>    These shaven crowns upon the left of us.”</a>
<a id='line_1411'></a>
<a id='line_1412'>And he to me: “All of them were asquint</a>
<a id='line_1413'>    In intellect in the first life, so much</a>
<a id='line_1414'>    That there with measure they no spending made.</a>
<a id='line_1415'></a>
<a id='line_1416'>Clearly enough their voices bark it forth,</a>
<a id='line_1417'>    Whene’er they reach the two points of the circle,</a>
<a id='line_1418'>    Where sunders them the opposite defect.</a>
<a id='line_1419'></a>
<a id='line_1420'>Clerks those were who no hairy covering</a>
<a id='line_1421'>    Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals,</a>
<a id='line_1422'>    In whom doth Avarice practise its excess.”</a>
<a id='line_1423'></a>
<a id='line_1424'>And I: “My Master, among such as these</a>
<a id='line_1425'>    I ought forsooth to recognise some few,</a>
<a id='line_1426'>    Who were infected with these maladies.”</a>
<a id='line_1427'></a>
<a id='line_1428'>And he to me: “Vain thought thou entertainest;</a>
<a id='line_1429'>    The undiscerning life which made them sordid</a>
<a id='line_1430'>    Now makes them unto all discernment dim.</a>
<a id='line_1431'></a>
<a id='line_1432'>Forever shall they come to these two buttings;</a>
<a id='line_1433'>    These from the sepulchre shall rise again</a>
<a id='line_1434'>    With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.</a>
<a id='line_1435'></a>
<a id='line_1436'>Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world</a>
<a id='line_1437'>    Have ta’en from them, and placed them in this scuffle;</a>
<a id='line_1438'>    Whate’er it be, no words adorn I for it.</a>
<a id='line_1439'></a>
<a id='line_1440'>Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce</a>
<a id='line_1441'>    Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,</a>
<a id='line_1442'>    For which the human race each other buffet;</a>
<a id='line_1443'></a>
<a id='line_1444'>For all the gold that is beneath the moon,</a>
<a id='line_1445'>    Or ever has been, of these weary souls</a>
<a id='line_1446'>    Could never make a single one repose.”</a>
<a id='line_1447'></a>
<a id='line_1448'>“Master,” I said to him, “now tell me also</a>
<a id='line_1449'>    What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,</a>
<a id='line_1450'>    That has the world’s goods so within its clutches?”</a>
<a id='line_1451'></a>
<a id='line_1452'>And he to me: “O creatures imbecile,</a>
<a id='line_1453'>    What ignorance is this which doth beset you?</a>
<a id='line_1454'>    Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.</a>
<a id='line_1455'></a>
<a id='line_1456'>He whose omniscience everything transcends</a>
<a id='line_1457'>    The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,</a>
<a id='line_1458'>    That every part to every part may shine,</a>
<a id='line_1459'></a>
<a id='line_1460'>Distributing the light in equal measure;</a>
<a id='line_1461'>    He in like manner to the mundane splendours</a>
<a id='line_1462'>    Ordained a general ministress and guide,</a>
<a id='line_1463'></a>
<a id='line_1464'>That she might change at times the empty treasures</a>
<a id='line_1465'>    From race to race, from one blood to another,</a>
<a id='line_1466'>    Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.</a>
<a id='line_1467'></a>
<a id='line_1468'>Therefore one people triumphs, and another</a>
<a id='line_1469'>    Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment,</a>
<a id='line_1470'>    Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.</a>
<a id='line_1471'></a>
<a id='line_1472'>Your knowledge has no counterstand against her;</a>
<a id='line_1473'>    She makes provision, judges, and pursues</a>
<a id='line_1474'>    Her governance, as theirs the other gods.</a>
<a id='line_1475'></a>
<a id='line_1476'>Her permutations have not any truce;</a>
<a id='line_1477'>    Necessity makes her precipitate,</a>
<a id='line_1478'>    So often cometh who his turn obtains.</a>
<a id='line_1479'></a>
<a id='line_1480'>And this is she who is so crucified</a>
<a id='line_1481'>    Even by those who ought to give her praise,</a>
<a id='line_1482'>    Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.</a>
<a id='line_1483'></a>
<a id='line_1484'>But she is blissful, and she hears it not;</a>
<a id='line_1485'>    Among the other primal creatures gladsome</a>
<a id='line_1486'>    She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.</a>
<a id='line_1487'></a>
<a id='line_1488'>Let us descend now unto greater woe;</a>
<a id='line_1489'>    Already sinks each star that was ascending</a>
<a id='line_1490'>    When I set out, and loitering is forbidden.”</a>
<a id='line_1491'></a>
<a id='line_1492'>We crossed the circle to the other bank,</a>
<a id='line_1493'>    Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself</a>
<a id='line_1494'>    Along a gully that runs out of it.</a>
<a id='line_1495'></a>
<a id='line_1496'>The water was more sombre far than perse;</a>
<a id='line_1497'>    And we, in company with the dusky waves,</a>
<a id='line_1498'>    Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.</a>
<a id='line_1499'></a>
<a id='line_1500'>A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,</a>
<a id='line_1501'>    This tristful brooklet, when it has descended</a>
<a id='line_1502'>    Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.</a>
<a id='line_1503'></a>
<a id='line_1504'>And I, who stood intent upon beholding,</a>
<a id='line_1505'>    Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,</a>
<a id='line_1506'>    All of them naked and with angry look.</a>
<a id='line_1507'></a>
<a id='line_1508'>They smote each other not alone with hands,</a>
<a id='line_1509'>    But with the head and with the breast and feet,</a>
<a id='line_1510'>    Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.</a>
<a id='line_1511'></a>
<a id='line_1512'>Said the good Master: “Son, thou now beholdest</a>
<a id='line_1513'>    The souls of those whom anger overcame;</a>
<a id='line_1514'>    And likewise I would have thee know for certain</a>
<a id='line_1515'></a>
<a id='line_1516'>Beneath the water people are who sigh</a>
<a id='line_1517'>    And make this water bubble at the surface,</a>
<a id='line_1518'>    As the eye tells thee wheresoe’er it turns.</a>
<a id='line_1519'></a>
<a id='line_1520'>Fixed in the mire they say, ‘We sullen were</a>
<a id='line_1521'>    In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened,</a>
<a id='line_1522'>    Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;</a>
<a id='line_1523'></a>
<a id='line_1524'>Now we are sullen in this sable mire.’</a>
<a id='line_1525'>    This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats,</a>
<a id='line_1526'>    For with unbroken words they cannot say it.”</a>
<a id='line_1527'></a>
<a id='line_1528'>Thus we went circling round the filthy fen</a>
<a id='line_1529'>    A great arc ’twixt the dry bank and the swamp,</a>
<a id='line_1530'>    With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;</a>
<a id='line_1531'></a>
<a id='line_1532'>Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.</a>
<a id='line_1533'></a>
<a id='line_1534'></a>
<a id='line_1535'></a>
<a id='line_1536'></a>
<a id='line_1537'>Inferno: Canto VIII</a>
<a id='line_1538'></a>
<a id='line_1539'></a>
<a id='line_1540'>I say, continuing, that long before</a>
<a id='line_1541'>    We to the foot of that high tower had come,</a>
<a id='line_1542'>    Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,</a>
<a id='line_1543'></a>
<a id='line_1544'>By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,</a>
<a id='line_1545'>    And from afar another answer them,</a>
<a id='line_1546'>    So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.</a>
<a id='line_1547'></a>
<a id='line_1548'>And, to the sea of all discernment turned,</a>
<a id='line_1549'>    I said: “What sayeth this, and what respondeth</a>
<a id='line_1550'>    That other fire? and who are they that made it?”</a>
<a id='line_1551'></a>
<a id='line_1552'>And he to me: “Across the turbid waves</a>
<a id='line_1553'>    What is expected thou canst now discern,</a>
<a id='line_1554'>    If reek of the morass conceal it not.”</a>
<a id='line_1555'></a>
<a id='line_1556'>Cord never shot an arrow from itself</a>
<a id='line_1557'>    That sped away athwart the air so swift,</a>
<a id='line_1558'>    As I beheld a very little boat</a>
<a id='line_1559'></a>
<a id='line_1560'>Come o’er the water tow’rds us at that moment,</a>
<a id='line_1561'>    Under the guidance of a single pilot,</a>
<a id='line_1562'>    Who shouted, “Now art thou arrived, fell soul?”</a>
<a id='line_1563'></a>
<a id='line_1564'>“Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain</a>
<a id='line_1565'>    For this once,” said my Lord; “thou shalt not have us</a>
<a id='line_1566'>    Longer than in the passing of the slough.”</a>
<a id='line_1567'></a>
<a id='line_1568'>As he who listens to some great deceit</a>
<a id='line_1569'>    That has been done to him, and then resents it,</a>
<a id='line_1570'>    Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.</a>
<a id='line_1571'></a>
<a id='line_1572'>My Guide descended down into the boat,</a>
<a id='line_1573'>    And then he made me enter after him,</a>
<a id='line_1574'>    And only when I entered seemed it laden.</a>
<a id='line_1575'></a>
<a id='line_1576'>Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat,</a>
<a id='line_1577'>    The antique prow goes on its way, dividing</a>
<a id='line_1578'>    More of the water than ’tis wont with others.</a>
<a id='line_1579'></a>
<a id='line_1580'>While we were running through the dead canal,</a>
<a id='line_1581'>    Uprose in front of me one full of mire,</a>
<a id='line_1582'>    And said, “Who ’rt thou that comest ere the hour?”</a>
<a id='line_1583'></a>
<a id='line_1584'>And I to him: “Although I come, I stay not;</a>
<a id='line_1585'>    But who art thou that hast become so squalid?”</a>
<a id='line_1586'>    “Thou seest that I am one who weeps,” he answered.</a>
<a id='line_1587'></a>
<a id='line_1588'>And I to him: “With weeping and with wailing,</a>
<a id='line_1589'>    Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;</a>
<a id='line_1590'>    For thee I know, though thou art all defiled.”</a>
<a id='line_1591'></a>
<a id='line_1592'>Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;</a>
<a id='line_1593'>    Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,</a>
<a id='line_1594'>    Saying, “Away there with the other dogs!”</a>
<a id='line_1595'></a>
<a id='line_1596'>Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;</a>
<a id='line_1597'>    He kissed my face, and said: “Disdainful soul,</a>
<a id='line_1598'>    Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.</a>
<a id='line_1599'></a>
<a id='line_1600'>That was an arrogant person in the world;</a>
<a id='line_1601'>    Goodness is none, that decks his memory;</a>
<a id='line_1602'>    So likewise here his shade is furious.</a>
<a id='line_1603'></a>
<a id='line_1604'>How many are esteemed great kings up there,</a>
<a id='line_1605'>    Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,</a>
<a id='line_1606'>    Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!”</a>
<a id='line_1607'></a>
<a id='line_1608'>And I: “My Master, much should I be pleased,</a>
<a id='line_1609'>    If I could see him soused into this broth,</a>
<a id='line_1610'>    Before we issue forth out of the lake.”</a>
<a id='line_1611'></a>
<a id='line_1612'>And he to me: “Ere unto thee the shore</a>
<a id='line_1613'>    Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;</a>
<a id='line_1614'>    Such a desire ’tis meet thou shouldst enjoy.”</a>
<a id='line_1615'></a>
<a id='line_1616'>A little after that, I saw such havoc</a>
<a id='line_1617'>    Made of him by the people of the mire,</a>
<a id='line_1618'>    That still I praise and thank my God for it.</a>
<a id='line_1619'></a>
<a id='line_1620'>They all were shouting, “At Philippo Argenti!”</a>
<a id='line_1621'>    And that exasperate spirit Florentine</a>
<a id='line_1622'>    Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.</a>
<a id='line_1623'></a>
<a id='line_1624'>We left him there, and more of him I tell not;</a>
<a id='line_1625'>    But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,</a>
<a id='line_1626'>    Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.</a>
<a id='line_1627'></a>
<a id='line_1628'>And the good Master said: “Even now, my Son,</a>
<a id='line_1629'>    The city draweth near whose name is Dis,</a>
<a id='line_1630'>    With the grave citizens, with the great throng.”</a>
<a id='line_1631'></a>
<a id='line_1632'>And I: “Its mosques already, Master, clearly</a>
<a id='line_1633'>    Within there in the valley I discern</a>
<a id='line_1634'>    Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire</a>
<a id='line_1635'></a>
<a id='line_1636'>They were.” And he to me: “The fire eternal</a>
<a id='line_1637'>    That kindles them within makes them look red,</a>
<a id='line_1638'>    As thou beholdest in this nether Hell.”</a>
<a id='line_1639'></a>
<a id='line_1640'>Then we arrived within the moats profound,</a>
<a id='line_1641'>    That circumvallate that disconsolate city;</a>
<a id='line_1642'>    The walls appeared to me to be of iron.</a>
<a id='line_1643'></a>
<a id='line_1644'>Not without making first a circuit wide,</a>
<a id='line_1645'>    We came unto a place where loud the pilot</a>
<a id='line_1646'>    Cried out to us, “Debark, here is the entrance.”</a>
<a id='line_1647'></a>
<a id='line_1648'>More than a thousand at the gates I saw</a>
<a id='line_1649'>    Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily</a>
<a id='line_1650'>    Were saying, “Who is this that without death</a>
<a id='line_1651'></a>
<a id='line_1652'>Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?”</a>
<a id='line_1653'>    And my sagacious Master made a sign</a>
<a id='line_1654'>    Of wishing secretly to speak with them.</a>
<a id='line_1655'></a>
<a id='line_1656'>A little then they quelled their great disdain,</a>
<a id='line_1657'>    And said: “Come thou alone, and he begone</a>
<a id='line_1658'>    Who has so boldly entered these dominions.</a>
<a id='line_1659'></a>
<a id='line_1660'>Let him return alone by his mad road;</a>
<a id='line_1661'>    Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,</a>
<a id='line_1662'>    Who hast escorted him through such dark regions.”</a>
<a id='line_1663'></a>
<a id='line_1664'>Think, Reader, if I was discomforted</a>
<a id='line_1665'>    At utterance of the accursed words;</a>
<a id='line_1666'>    For never to return here I believed.</a>
<a id='line_1667'></a>
<a id='line_1668'>“O my dear Guide, who more than seven times</a>
<a id='line_1669'>    Hast rendered me security, and drawn me</a>
<a id='line_1670'>    From imminent peril that before me stood,</a>
<a id='line_1671'></a>
<a id='line_1672'>Do not desert me,” said I, “thus undone;</a>
<a id='line_1673'>    And if the going farther be denied us,</a>
<a id='line_1674'>    Let us retrace our steps together swiftly.”</a>
<a id='line_1675'></a>
<a id='line_1676'>And that Lord, who had led me thitherward,</a>
<a id='line_1677'>    Said unto me: “Fear not; because our passage</a>
<a id='line_1678'>    None can take from us, it by Such is given.</a>
<a id='line_1679'></a>
<a id='line_1680'>But here await me, and thy weary spirit</a>
<a id='line_1681'>    Comfort and nourish with a better hope;</a>
<a id='line_1682'>    For in this nether world I will not leave thee.”</a>
<a id='line_1683'></a>
<a id='line_1684'>So onward goes and there abandons me</a>
<a id='line_1685'>    My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,</a>
<a id='line_1686'>    For No and Yes within my head contend.</a>
<a id='line_1687'></a>
<a id='line_1688'>I could not hear what he proposed to them;</a>
<a id='line_1689'>    But with them there he did not linger long,</a>
<a id='line_1690'>    Ere each within in rivalry ran back.</a>
<a id='line_1691'></a>
<a id='line_1692'>They closed the portals, those our adversaries,</a>
<a id='line_1693'>    On my Lord’s breast, who had remained without</a>
<a id='line_1694'>    And turned to me with footsteps far between.</a>
<a id='line_1695'></a>
<a id='line_1696'>His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he</a>
<a id='line_1697'>    Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,</a>
<a id='line_1698'>    “Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?”</a>
<a id='line_1699'></a>
<a id='line_1700'>And unto me: “Thou, because I am angry,</a>
<a id='line_1701'>    Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,</a>
<a id='line_1702'>    Whatever for defence within be planned.</a>
<a id='line_1703'></a>
<a id='line_1704'>This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;</a>
<a id='line_1705'>    For once they used it at less secret gate,</a>
<a id='line_1706'>    Which finds itself without a fastening still.</a>
<a id='line_1707'></a>
<a id='line_1708'>O’er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;</a>
<a id='line_1709'>    And now this side of it descends the steep,</a>
<a id='line_1710'>    Passing across the circles without escort,</a>
<a id='line_1711'></a>
<a id='line_1712'>One by whose means the city shall be opened.”</a>

<a id='line_1717'>Inferno: Canto IX</a>
<a id='line_1718'></a>
<a id='line_1719'></a>
<a id='line_1720'>That hue which cowardice brought out on me,</a>
<a id='line_1721'>    Beholding my Conductor backward turn,</a>
<a id='line_1722'>    Sooner repressed within him his new colour.</a>
<a id='line_1723'></a>
<a id='line_1724'>He stopped attentive, like a man who listens,</a>
<a id='line_1725'>    Because the eye could not conduct him far</a>
<a id='line_1726'>    Through the black air, and through the heavy fog.</a>
<a id='line_1727'></a>
<a id='line_1728'>“Still it behoveth us to win the fight,”</a>
<a id='line_1729'>    Began he; “Else. . .Such offered us herself. . .</a>
<a id='line_1730'>    O how I long that some one here arrive!”</a>
<a id='line_1731'></a>
<a id='line_1732'>Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning</a>
<a id='line_1733'>    He covered up with what came afterward,</a>
<a id='line_1734'>    That they were words quite different from the first;</a>
<a id='line_1735'></a>
<a id='line_1736'>But none the less his saying gave me fear,</a>
<a id='line_1737'>    Because I carried out the broken phrase,</a>
<a id='line_1738'>    Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had.</a>
<a id='line_1739'></a>
<a id='line_1740'>“Into this bottom of the doleful conch</a>
<a id='line_1741'>    Doth any e’er descend from the first grade,</a>
<a id='line_1742'>    Which for its pain has only hope cut off?”</a>
<a id='line_1743'></a>
<a id='line_1744'>This question put I; and he answered me:</a>
<a id='line_1745'>    “Seldom it comes to pass that one of us</a>
<a id='line_1746'>    Maketh the journey upon which I go.</a>
<a id='line_1747'></a>
<a id='line_1748'>True is it, once before I here below</a>
<a id='line_1749'>    Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho,</a>
<a id='line_1750'>    Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies.</a>
<a id='line_1751'></a>
<a id='line_1752'>Naked of me short while the flesh had been,</a>
<a id='line_1753'>    Before within that wall she made me enter,</a>
<a id='line_1754'>    To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas;</a>
<a id='line_1755'></a>
<a id='line_1756'>That is the lowest region and the darkest,</a>
<a id='line_1757'>    And farthest from the heaven which circles all.</a>
<a id='line_1758'>    Well know I the way; therefore be reassured.</a>
<a id='line_1759'></a>
<a id='line_1760'>This fen, which a prodigious stench exhales,</a>
<a id='line_1761'>    Encompasses about the city dolent,</a>
<a id='line_1762'>    Where now we cannot enter without anger.”</a>
<a id='line_1763'></a>
<a id='line_1764'>And more he said, but not in mind I have it;</a>
<a id='line_1765'>    Because mine eye had altogether drawn me</a>
<a id='line_1766'>    Tow’rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,</a>
<a id='line_1767'></a>
<a id='line_1768'>Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen</a>
<a id='line_1769'>    The three infernal Furies stained with blood,</a>
<a id='line_1770'>    Who had the limbs of women and their mien,</a>
<a id='line_1771'></a>
<a id='line_1772'>And with the greenest hydras were begirt;</a>
<a id='line_1773'>    Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,</a>
<a id='line_1774'>    Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.</a>
<a id='line_1775'></a>
<a id='line_1776'>And he who well the handmaids of the Queen</a>
<a id='line_1777'>    Of everlasting lamentation knew,</a>
<a id='line_1778'>    Said unto me: “Behold the fierce Erinnys.</a>
<a id='line_1779'></a>
<a id='line_1780'>This is Megaera, on the left-hand side;</a>
<a id='line_1781'>    She who is weeping on the right, Alecto;</a>
<a id='line_1782'>    Tisiphone is between;” and then was silent.</a>
<a id='line_1783'></a>
<a id='line_1784'>Each one her breast was rending with her nails;</a>
<a id='line_1785'>    They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,</a>
<a id='line_1786'>    That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.</a>
<a id='line_1787'></a>
<a id='line_1788'>“Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!”</a>
<a id='line_1789'>    All shouted looking down; “in evil hour</a>
<a id='line_1790'>    Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!”</a>
<a id='line_1791'></a>
<a id='line_1792'>“Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut,</a>
<a id='line_1793'>    For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it,</a>
<a id='line_1794'>    No more returning upward would there be.”</a>
<a id='line_1795'></a>
<a id='line_1796'>Thus said the Master; and he turned me round</a>
<a id='line_1797'>    Himself, and trusted not unto my hands</a>
<a id='line_1798'>    So far as not to blind me with his own.</a>
<a id='line_1799'></a>
<a id='line_1800'>O ye who have undistempered intellects,</a>
<a id='line_1801'>    Observe the doctrine that conceals itself</a>
<a id='line_1802'>    Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!</a>
<a id='line_1803'></a>
<a id='line_1804'>And now there came across the turbid waves</a>
<a id='line_1805'>    The clangour of a sound with terror fraught,</a>
<a id='line_1806'>    Because of which both of the margins trembled;</a>
<a id='line_1807'></a>
<a id='line_1808'>Not otherwise it was than of a wind</a>
<a id='line_1809'>    Impetuous on account of adverse heats,</a>
<a id='line_1810'>    That smites the forest, and, without restraint,</a>
<a id='line_1811'></a>
<a id='line_1812'>The branches rends, beats down, and bears away;</a>
<a id='line_1813'>    Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,</a>
<a id='line_1814'>    And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.</a>
<a id='line_1815'></a>
<a id='line_1816'>Mine eyes he loosed, and said: “Direct the nerve</a>
<a id='line_1817'>    Of vision now along that ancient foam,</a>
<a id='line_1818'>    There yonder where that smoke is most intense.”</a>
<a id='line_1819'></a>
<a id='line_1820'>Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent</a>
<a id='line_1821'>    Across the water scatter all abroad,</a>
<a id='line_1822'>    Until each one is huddled in the earth.</a>
<a id='line_1823'></a>
<a id='line_1824'>More than a thousand ruined souls I saw,</a>
<a id='line_1825'>    Thus fleeing from before one who on foot</a>
<a id='line_1826'>    Was passing o’er the Styx with soles unwet.</a>
<a id='line_1827'></a>
<a id='line_1828'>From off his face he fanned that unctuous air,</a>
<a id='line_1829'>    Waving his left hand oft in front of him,</a>
<a id='line_1830'>    And only with that anguish seemed he weary.</a>
<a id='line_1831'></a>
<a id='line_1832'>Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,</a>
<a id='line_1833'>    And to the Master turned; and he made sign</a>
<a id='line_1834'>    That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.</a>
<a id='line_1835'></a>
<a id='line_1836'>Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me!</a>
<a id='line_1837'>    He reached the gate, and with a little rod</a>
<a id='line_1838'>    He opened it, for there was no resistance.</a>
<a id='line_1839'></a>
<a id='line_1840'>“O banished out of Heaven, people despised!”</a>
<a id='line_1841'>    Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;</a>
<a id='line_1842'>    “Whence is this arrogance within you couched?</a>
<a id='line_1843'></a>
<a id='line_1844'>Wherefore recalcitrate against that will,</a>
<a id='line_1845'>    From which the end can never be cut off,</a>
<a id='line_1846'>    And which has many times increased your pain?</a>
<a id='line_1847'></a>
<a id='line_1848'>What helpeth it to butt against the fates?</a>
<a id='line_1849'>    Your Cerberus, if you remember well,</a>
<a id='line_1850'>    For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled.”</a>
<a id='line_1851'></a>
<a id='line_1852'>Then he returned along the miry road,</a>
<a id='line_1853'>    And spake no word to us, but had the look</a>
<a id='line_1854'>    Of one whom other care constrains and goads</a>
<a id='line_1855'></a>
<a id='line_1856'>Than that of him who in his presence is;</a>
<a id='line_1857'>    And we our feet directed tow’rds the city,</a>
<a id='line_1858'>    After those holy words all confident.</a>
<a id='line_1859'></a>
<a id='line_1860'>Within we entered without any contest;</a>
<a id='line_1861'>    And I, who inclination had to see</a>
<a id='line_1862'>    What the condition such a fortress holds,</a>
<a id='line_1863'></a>
<a id='line_1864'>Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye,</a>
<a id='line_1865'>    And see on every hand an ample plain,</a>
<a id='line_1866'>    Full of distress and torment terrible.</a>
<a id='line_1867'></a>
<a id='line_1868'>Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,</a>
<a id='line_1869'>    Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,</a>
<a id='line_1870'>    That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,</a>
<a id='line_1871'></a>
<a id='line_1872'>The sepulchres make all the place uneven;</a>
<a id='line_1873'>    So likewise did they there on every side,</a>
<a id='line_1874'>    Saving that there the manner was more bitter;</a>
<a id='line_1875'></a>
<a id='line_1876'>For flames between the sepulchres were scattered,</a>
<a id='line_1877'>    By which they so intensely heated were,</a>
<a id='line_1878'>    That iron more so asks not any art.</a>
<a id='line_1879'></a>
<a id='line_1880'>All of their coverings uplifted were,</a>
<a id='line_1881'>    And from them issued forth such dire laments,</a>
<a id='line_1882'>    Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.</a>
<a id='line_1883'></a>
<a id='line_1884'>And I: “My Master, what are all those people</a>
<a id='line_1885'>    Who, having sepulture within those tombs,</a>
<a id='line_1886'>    Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?”</a>
<a id='line_1887'></a>
<a id='line_1888'>And he to me: “Here are the Heresiarchs,</a>
<a id='line_1889'>    With their disciples of all sects, and much</a>
<a id='line_1890'>    More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.</a>
<a id='line_1891'></a>
<a id='line_1892'>Here like together with its like is buried;</a>
<a id='line_1893'>    And more and less the monuments are heated.”</a>
<a id='line_1894'>    And when he to the right had turned, we passed</a>
<a id='line_1895'></a>
<a id='line_1896'>Between the torments and high parapets.</a>
<a id='line_1897'></a>
<a id='line_1898'></a>
<a id='line_1899'></a>
<a id='line_1900'></a>
<a id='line_1901'>Inferno: Canto X</a>
<a id='line_1902'></a>
<a id='line_1903'></a>
<a id='line_1904'>Now onward goes, along a narrow path</a>
<a id='line_1905'>    Between the torments and the city wall,</a>
<a id='line_1906'>    My Master, and I follow at his back.</a>
<a id='line_1907'></a>
<a id='line_1908'>“O power supreme, that through these impious circles</a>
<a id='line_1909'>    Turnest me,” I began, “as pleases thee,</a>
<a id='line_1910'>    Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;</a>
<a id='line_1911'></a>
<a id='line_1912'>The people who are lying in these tombs,</a>
<a id='line_1913'>    Might they be seen? already are uplifted</a>
<a id='line_1914'>    The covers all, and no one keepeth guard.”</a>
<a id='line_1915'></a>
<a id='line_1916'>And he to me: “They all will be closed up</a>
<a id='line_1917'>    When from Jehoshaphat they shall return</a>
<a id='line_1918'>    Here with the bodies they have left above.</a>
<a id='line_1919'></a>
<a id='line_1920'>Their cemetery have upon this side</a>
<a id='line_1921'>    With Epicurus all his followers,</a>
<a id='line_1922'>    Who with the body mortal make the soul;</a>
<a id='line_1923'></a>
<a id='line_1924'>But in the question thou dost put to me,</a>
<a id='line_1925'>    Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,</a>
<a id='line_1926'>    And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent.”</a>
<a id='line_1927'></a>
<a id='line_1928'>And I: “Good Leader, I but keep concealed</a>
<a id='line_1929'>    From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,</a>
<a id='line_1930'>    Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me.”</a>
<a id='line_1931'></a>
<a id='line_1932'>“O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire</a>
<a id='line_1933'>    Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,</a>
<a id='line_1934'>    Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.</a>
<a id='line_1935'></a>
<a id='line_1936'>Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest</a>
<a id='line_1937'>    A native of that noble fatherland,</a>
<a id='line_1938'>    To which perhaps I too molestful was.”</a>
<a id='line_1939'></a>
<a id='line_1940'>Upon a sudden issued forth this sound</a>
<a id='line_1941'>    From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,</a>
<a id='line_1942'>    Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.</a>
<a id='line_1943'></a>
<a id='line_1944'>And unto me he said: “Turn thee; what dost thou?</a>
<a id='line_1945'>    Behold there Farinata who has risen;</a>
<a id='line_1946'>    From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him.”</a>
<a id='line_1947'></a>
<a id='line_1948'>I had already fixed mine eyes on his,</a>
<a id='line_1949'>    And he uprose erect with breast and front</a>
<a id='line_1950'>    E’en as if Hell he had in great despite.</a>
<a id='line_1951'></a>
<a id='line_1952'>And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader</a>
<a id='line_1953'>    Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,</a>
<a id='line_1954'>    Exclaiming, “Let thy words explicit be.”</a>
<a id='line_1955'></a>
<a id='line_1956'>As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb</a>
<a id='line_1957'>    Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,</a>
<a id='line_1958'>    Then asked of me, “Who were thine ancestors?”</a>
<a id='line_1959'></a>
<a id='line_1960'>I, who desirous of obeying was,</a>
<a id='line_1961'>    Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;</a>
<a id='line_1962'>    Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.</a>
<a id='line_1963'></a>
<a id='line_1964'>Then said he: “Fiercely adverse have they been</a>
<a id='line_1965'>    To me, and to my fathers, and my party;</a>
<a id='line_1966'>    So that two several times I scattered them.”</a>
<a id='line_1967'></a>
<a id='line_1968'>“If they were banished, they returned on all sides,”</a>
<a id='line_1969'>    I answered him, “the first time and the second;</a>
<a id='line_1970'>    But yours have not acquired that art aright.”</a>
<a id='line_1971'></a>
<a id='line_1972'>Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered</a>
<a id='line_1973'>    Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;</a>
<a id='line_1974'>    I think that he had risen on his knees.</a>
<a id='line_1975'></a>
<a id='line_1976'>Round me he gazed, as if solicitude</a>
<a id='line_1977'>    He had to see if some one else were with me,</a>
<a id='line_1978'>    But after his suspicion was all spent,</a>
<a id='line_1979'></a>
<a id='line_1980'>Weeping, he said to me: “If through this blind</a>
<a id='line_1981'>    Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,</a>
<a id='line_1982'>    Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?”</a>
<a id='line_1983'></a>
<a id='line_1984'>And I to him: “I come not of myself;</a>
<a id='line_1985'>    He who is waiting yonder leads me here,</a>
<a id='line_1986'>    Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had.”</a>
<a id='line_1987'></a>
<a id='line_1988'>His language and the mode of punishment</a>
<a id='line_1989'>    Already unto me had read his name;</a>
<a id='line_1990'>    On that account my answer was so full.</a>
<a id='line_1991'></a>
<a id='line_1992'>Up starting suddenly, he cried out: “How</a>
<a id='line_1993'>    Saidst thou,—he had? Is he not still alive?</a>
<a id='line_1994'>    Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?”</a>
<a id='line_1995'></a>
<a id='line_1996'>When he became aware of some delay,</a>
<a id='line_1997'>    Which I before my answer made, supine</a>
<a id='line_1998'>    He fell again, and forth appeared no more.</a>
<a id='line_1999'></a>
<a id='line_2000'>But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire</a>
<a id='line_2001'>    I had remained, did not his aspect change,</a>
<a id='line_2002'>    Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.</a>
<a id='line_2003'></a>
<a id='line_2004'>“And if,” continuing his first discourse,</a>
<a id='line_2005'>    “They have that art,” he said, “not learned aright,</a>
<a id='line_2006'>    That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.</a>
<a id='line_2007'></a>
<a id='line_2008'>But fifty times shall not rekindled be</a>
<a id='line_2009'>    The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,</a>
<a id='line_2010'>    Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;</a>
<a id='line_2011'></a>
<a id='line_2012'>And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,</a>
<a id='line_2013'>    Say why that people is so pitiless</a>
<a id='line_2014'>    Against my race in each one of its laws?”</a>
<a id='line_2015'></a>
<a id='line_2016'>Whence I to him: “The slaughter and great carnage</a>
<a id='line_2017'>    Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause</a>
<a id='line_2018'>    Such orisons in our temple to be made.”</a>
<a id='line_2019'></a>
<a id='line_2020'>After his head he with a sigh had shaken,</a>
<a id='line_2021'>    “There I was not alone,” he said, “nor surely</a>
<a id='line_2022'>    Without a cause had with the others moved.</a>
<a id='line_2023'></a>
<a id='line_2024'>But there I was alone, where every one</a>
<a id='line_2025'>    Consented to the laying waste of Florence,</a>
<a id='line_2026'>    He who defended her with open face.”</a>
<a id='line_2027'></a>
<a id='line_2028'>“Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,”</a>
<a id='line_2029'>    I him entreated, “solve for me that knot,</a>
<a id='line_2030'>    Which has entangled my conceptions here.</a>
<a id='line_2031'></a>
<a id='line_2032'>It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,</a>
<a id='line_2033'>    Beforehand whatsoe’er time brings with it,</a>
<a id='line_2034'>    And in the present have another mode.”</a>
<a id='line_2035'></a>
<a id='line_2036'>“We see, like those who have imperfect sight,</a>
<a id='line_2037'>    The things,” he said, “that distant are from us;</a>
<a id='line_2038'>    So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.</a>
<a id='line_2039'></a>
<a id='line_2040'>When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain</a>
<a id='line_2041'>    Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,</a>
<a id='line_2042'>    Not anything know we of your human state.</a>
<a id='line_2043'></a>
<a id='line_2044'>Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead</a>
<a id='line_2045'>    Will be our knowledge from the moment when</a>
<a id='line_2046'>    The portal of the future shall be closed.”</a>
<a id='line_2047'></a>
<a id='line_2048'>Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,</a>
<a id='line_2049'>    Said: “Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,</a>
<a id='line_2050'>    That still his son is with the living joined.</a>
<a id='line_2051'></a>
<a id='line_2052'>And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,</a>
<a id='line_2053'>    Tell him I did it because I was thinking</a>
<a id='line_2054'>    Already of the error you have solved me.”</a>
<a id='line_2055'></a>
<a id='line_2056'>And now my Master was recalling me,</a>
<a id='line_2057'>    Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit</a>
<a id='line_2058'>    That he would tell me who was with him there.</a>
<a id='line_2059'></a>
<a id='line_2060'>He said: “With more than a thousand here I lie;</a>
<a id='line_2061'>    Within here is the second Frederick,</a>
<a id='line_2062'>    And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not.”</a>
<a id='line_2063'></a>
<a id='line_2064'>Thereon he hid himself; and I towards</a>
<a id='line_2065'>    The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting</a>
<a id='line_2066'>    Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.</a>
<a id='line_2067'></a>
<a id='line_2068'>He moved along; and afterward thus going,</a>
<a id='line_2069'>    He said to me, “Why art thou so bewildered?”</a>
<a id='line_2070'>    And I in his inquiry satisfied him.</a>
<a id='line_2071'></a>
<a id='line_2072'>“Let memory preserve what thou hast heard</a>
<a id='line_2073'>    Against thyself,” that Sage commanded me,</a>
<a id='line_2074'>    “And now attend here;” and he raised his finger.</a>
<a id='line_2075'></a>
<a id='line_2076'>“When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet</a>
<a id='line_2077'>    Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,</a>
<a id='line_2078'>    From her thou’lt know the journey of thy life.”</a>
<a id='line_2079'></a>
<a id='line_2080'>Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;</a>
<a id='line_2081'>    We left the wall, and went towards the middle,</a>
<a id='line_2082'>    Along a path that strikes into a valley,</a>
<a id='line_2083'></a>
<a id='line_2084'>Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.</a>

<a id='line_2089'>Inferno: Canto XI</a>
<a id='line_2090'></a>
<a id='line_2091'></a>
<a id='line_2092'>Upon the margin of a lofty bank</a>
<a id='line_2093'>    Which great rocks broken in a circle made,</a>
<a id='line_2094'>    We came upon a still more cruel throng;</a>
<a id='line_2095'></a>
<a id='line_2096'>And there, by reason of the horrible</a>
<a id='line_2097'>    Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out,</a>
<a id='line_2098'>    We drew ourselves aside behind the cover</a>
<a id='line_2099'></a>
<a id='line_2100'>Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing,</a>
<a id='line_2101'>    Which said: “Pope Anastasius I hold,</a>
<a id='line_2102'>    Whom out of the right way Photinus drew.”</a>

<a id='line_2107'></a>
<a id='line_2108'>The Master thus; and unto him I said,</a>
<a id='line_2109'>    “Some compensation find, that the time pass not</a>
<a id='line_2110'>    Idly;” and he: “Thou seest I think of that.</a>
<a id='line_2111'></a>
<a id='line_2112'>My son, upon the inside of these rocks,”</a>
<a id='line_2113'>    Began he then to say, “are three small circles,</a>
<a id='line_2114'>    From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving.</a>

<a id='line_2142'>    Tormenteth all in companies diverse.</a>
<a id='line_2143'></a>
<a id='line_2144'>Man may lay violent hands upon himself</a>

<a id='line_2154'>    And by disdaining Nature and her bounty.</a>
<a id='line_2155'></a>

<a id='line_2162'>    And him who doth no confidence imburse.</a>
<a id='line_2163'></a>
<a id='line_2164'>This latter mode, it would appear, dissevers</a>

<a id='line_2174'>    From which there is a special faith engendered.</a>
<a id='line_2175'></a>
<a id='line_2176'>Hence in the smallest circle, where the point is</a>
<a id='line_2177'>    Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated,</a>
<a id='line_2178'>    Whoe’er betrays for ever is consumed.”</a>
<a id='line_2179'></a>
<a id='line_2180'>And I: “My Master, clear enough proceeds</a>

<a id='line_2190'>    And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?”</a>
<a id='line_2191'></a>
<a id='line_2192'>And unto me he said: “Why wanders so</a>

<a id='line_2211'></a>
<a id='line_2212'>“O Sun, that healest all distempered vision,</a>

<a id='line_2217'>    “There where thou sayest that usury offends</a>
<a id='line_2218'>    Goodness divine, and disengage the knot.”</a>
<a id='line_2219'></a>
<a id='line_2220'>“Philosophy,” he said, “to him who heeds it,</a>
<a id='line_2221'>    Noteth, not only in one place alone,</a>
<a id='line_2222'>    After what manner Nature takes her course</a>
<a id='line_2223'></a>

<a id='line_2230'>    So that your art is, as it were, God’s grandchild.</a>
<a id='line_2231'></a>
<a id='line_2232'>From these two, if thou bringest to thy mind</a>
<a id='line_2233'>    Genesis at the beginning, it behoves</a>
<a id='line_2234'>    Mankind to gain their life and to advance;</a>
<a id='line_2235'></a>
<a id='line_2236'>And since the usurer takes another way,</a>

<a id='line_2279'></a>
<a id='line_2280'>As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment</a>

<a id='line_2291'></a>
<a id='line_2292'>Thoughtful I went; and he said: “Thou art thinking</a>

<a id='line_2315'></a>
<a id='line_2316'>O blind cupidity, O wrath insane,</a>
<a id='line_2317'>    That spurs us onward so in our short life,</a>
<a id='line_2318'>    And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!</a>
<a id='line_2319'></a>
<a id='line_2320'>I saw an ample moat bent like a bow,</a>
<a id='line_2321'>    As one which all the plain encompasses,</a>
<a id='line_2322'>    Conformable to what my Guide had said.</a>
<a id='line_2323'></a>
<a id='line_2324'>And between this and the embankment’s foot</a>
<a id='line_2325'>    Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,</a>
<a id='line_2326'>    As in the world they used the chase to follow.</a>
<a id='line_2327'></a>
<a id='line_2328'>Beholding us descend, each one stood still,</a>
<a id='line_2329'>    And from the squadron three detached themselves,</a>
<a id='line_2330'>    With bows and arrows in advance selected;</a>
<a id='line_2331'></a>
<a id='line_2332'>And from afar one cried: “Unto what torment</a>
<a id='line_2333'>    Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?</a>
<a id='line_2334'>    Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow.”</a>
<a id='line_2335'></a>
<a id='line_2336'>My Master said: “Our answer will we make</a>
<a id='line_2337'>    To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,</a>
<a id='line_2338'>    That will of thine was evermore so hasty.”</a>
<a id='line_2339'></a>
<a id='line_2340'>Then touched he me, and said: “This one is Nessus,</a>
<a id='line_2341'>    Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,</a>
<a id='line_2342'>    And for himself, himself did vengeance take.</a>
<a id='line_2343'></a>
<a id='line_2344'>And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,</a>
<a id='line_2345'>    Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;</a>
<a id='line_2346'>    That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.</a>
<a id='line_2347'></a>
<a id='line_2348'>Thousands and thousands go about the moat</a>
<a id='line_2349'>    Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges</a>
<a id='line_2350'>    Out of the blood, more than his crime allots.”</a>
<a id='line_2351'></a>
<a id='line_2352'>Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;</a>
<a id='line_2353'>    Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch</a>
<a id='line_2354'>    Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.</a>
<a id='line_2355'></a>
<a id='line_2356'>After he had uncovered his great mouth,</a>
<a id='line_2357'>    He said to his companions: “Are you ware</a>

<a id='line_2359'></a>
<a id='line_2360'>Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men.”</a>
<a id='line_2361'>    And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,</a>
<a id='line_2362'>    Where the two natures are together joined,</a>
<a id='line_2363'></a>
<a id='line_2364'>Replied: “Indeed he lives, and thus alone</a>

<a id='line_2371'></a>
<a id='line_2372'>But by that virtue through which I am moving</a>
<a id='line_2373'>    My steps along this savage thoroughfare,</a>
<a id='line_2374'>    Give us some one of thine, to be with us,</a>
<a id='line_2375'></a>
<a id='line_2376'>And who may show us where to pass the ford,</a>
<a id='line_2377'>    And who may carry this one on his back;</a>
<a id='line_2378'>    For ’tis no spirit that can walk the air.”</a>
<a id='line_2379'></a>
<a id='line_2380'>Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,</a>
<a id='line_2381'>    And said to Nessus: “Turn and do thou guide them,</a>
<a id='line_2382'>    And warn aside, if other band may meet you.”</a>
<a id='line_2383'></a>
<a id='line_2384'>We with our faithful escort onward moved</a>
<a id='line_2385'>    Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,</a>
<a id='line_2386'>    Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.</a>
<a id='line_2387'></a>
<a id='line_2388'>People I saw within up to the eyebrows,</a>
<a id='line_2389'>    And the great Centaur said: “Tyrants are these,</a>
<a id='line_2390'>    Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.</a>
<a id='line_2391'></a>
<a id='line_2392'>Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here</a>
<a id='line_2393'>    Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius</a>
<a id='line_2394'>    Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.</a>
<a id='line_2395'></a>
<a id='line_2396'>That forehead there which has the hair so black</a>
<a id='line_2397'>    Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,</a>
<a id='line_2398'>    Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,</a>
<a id='line_2399'></a>
<a id='line_2400'>Up in the world was by his stepson slain.”</a>
<a id='line_2401'>    Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,</a>
<a id='line_2402'>    “Now he be first to thee, and second I.”</a>
<a id='line_2403'></a>
<a id='line_2404'>A little farther on the Centaur stopped</a>
<a id='line_2405'>    Above a folk, who far down as the throat</a>
<a id='line_2406'>    Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.</a>
<a id='line_2407'></a>
<a id='line_2408'>A shade he showed us on one side alone,</a>
<a id='line_2409'>    Saying: “He cleft asunder in God’s bosom</a>
<a id='line_2410'>    The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured.”</a>
<a id='line_2411'></a>
<a id='line_2412'>Then people saw I, who from out the river</a>
<a id='line_2413'>    Lifted their heads and also all the chest;</a>
<a id='line_2414'>    And many among these I recognised.</a>
<a id='line_2415'></a>
<a id='line_2416'>Thus ever more and more grew shallower</a>
<a id='line_2417'>    That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;</a>
<a id='line_2418'>    And there across the moat our passage was.</a>
<a id='line_2419'></a>
<a id='line_2420'>“Even as thou here upon this side beholdest</a>
<a id='line_2421'>    The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,”</a>
<a id='line_2422'>    The Centaur said, “I wish thee to believe</a>
<a id='line_2423'></a>
<a id='line_2424'>That on this other more and more declines</a>
<a id='line_2425'>    Its bed, until it reunites itself</a>
<a id='line_2426'>    Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.</a>
<a id='line_2427'></a>
<a id='line_2428'>Justice divine, upon this side, is goading</a>
<a id='line_2429'>    That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,</a>
<a id='line_2430'>    And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks</a>
<a id='line_2431'></a>
<a id='line_2432'>The tears which with the boiling it unseals</a>
<a id='line_2433'>    In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,</a>
<a id='line_2434'>    Who made upon the highways so much war.”</a>
<a id='line_2435'></a>
<a id='line_2436'>Then back he turned, and passed again the ford.</a>
<a id='line_2437'></a>
<a id='line_2438'></a>
<a id='line_2439'></a>
<a id='line_2440'></a>
<a id='line_2441'>Inferno: Canto XIII</a>
<a id='line_2442'></a>
<a id='line_2443'></a>
<a id='line_2444'>Not yet had Nessus reached the other side,</a>
<a id='line_2445'>    When we had put ourselves within a wood,</a>
<a id='line_2446'>    That was not marked by any path whatever.</a>
<a id='line_2447'></a>
<a id='line_2448'>Not foliage green, but of a dusky colour,</a>
<a id='line_2449'>    Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled,</a>
<a id='line_2450'>    Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison.</a>
<a id='line_2451'></a>
<a id='line_2452'>Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense,</a>
<a id='line_2453'>    Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold</a>
<a id='line_2454'>    ’Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places.</a>
<a id='line_2455'></a>
<a id='line_2456'>There do the hideous Harpies make their nests,</a>
<a id='line_2457'>    Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades,</a>
<a id='line_2458'>    With sad announcement of impending doom;</a>
<a id='line_2459'></a>
<a id='line_2460'>Broad wings have they, and necks and faces human,</a>
<a id='line_2461'>    And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;</a>
<a id='line_2462'>    They make laments upon the wondrous trees.</a>
<a id='line_2463'></a>
<a id='line_2464'>And the good Master: “Ere thou enter farther,</a>
<a id='line_2465'>    Know that thou art within the second round,”</a>
<a id='line_2466'>    Thus he began to say, “and shalt be, till</a>
<a id='line_2467'></a>
<a id='line_2468'>Thou comest out upon the horrible sand;</a>
<a id='line_2469'>    Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see</a>
<a id='line_2470'>    Things that will credence give unto my speech.”</a>
<a id='line_2471'></a>
<a id='line_2472'>I heard on all sides lamentations uttered,</a>
<a id='line_2473'>    And person none beheld I who might make them,</a>
<a id='line_2474'>    Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.</a>
<a id='line_2475'></a>
<a id='line_2476'>I think he thought that I perhaps might think</a>
<a id='line_2477'>    So many voices issued through those trunks</a>
<a id='line_2478'>    From people who concealed themselves from us;</a>
<a id='line_2479'></a>
<a id='line_2480'>Therefore the Master said: “If thou break off</a>
<a id='line_2481'>    Some little spray from any of these trees,</a>
<a id='line_2482'>    The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain.”</a>
<a id='line_2483'></a>
<a id='line_2484'>Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,</a>
<a id='line_2485'>    And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;</a>
<a id='line_2486'>    And the trunk cried, “Why dost thou mangle me?”</a>
<a id='line_2487'></a>
<a id='line_2488'>After it had become embrowned with blood,</a>
<a id='line_2489'>    It recommenced its cry: “Why dost thou rend me?</a>
<a id='line_2490'>    Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?</a>
<a id='line_2491'></a>
<a id='line_2492'>Men once we were, and now are changed to trees;</a>
<a id='line_2493'>    Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,</a>
<a id='line_2494'>    Even if the souls of serpents we had been.”</a>
<a id='line_2495'></a>
<a id='line_2496'>As out of a green brand, that is on fire</a>
<a id='line_2497'>    At one of the ends, and from the other drips</a>
<a id='line_2498'>    And hisses with the wind that is escaping;</a>
<a id='line_2499'></a>
<a id='line_2500'>So from that splinter issued forth together</a>
<a id='line_2501'>    Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip</a>
<a id='line_2502'>    Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.</a>
<a id='line_2503'></a>
<a id='line_2504'>“Had he been able sooner to believe,”</a>
<a id='line_2505'>    My Sage made answer, “O thou wounded soul,</a>
<a id='line_2506'>    What only in my verses he has seen,</a>
<a id='line_2507'></a>
<a id='line_2508'>Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;</a>
<a id='line_2509'>    Whereas the thing incredible has caused me</a>
<a id='line_2510'>    To put him to an act which grieveth me.</a>
<a id='line_2511'></a>
<a id='line_2512'>But tell him who thou wast, so that by way</a>
<a id='line_2513'>    Of some amends thy fame he may refresh</a>
<a id='line_2514'>    Up in the world, to which he can return.”</a>
<a id='line_2515'></a>
<a id='line_2516'>And the trunk said: “So thy sweet words allure me,</a>
<a id='line_2517'>    I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not,</a>
<a id='line_2518'>    That I a little to discourse am tempted.</a>
<a id='line_2519'></a>
<a id='line_2520'>I am the one who both keys had in keeping</a>
<a id='line_2521'>    Of Frederick’s heart, and turned them to and fro</a>
<a id='line_2522'>    So softly in unlocking and in locking,</a>
<a id='line_2523'></a>
<a id='line_2524'>That from his secrets most men I withheld;</a>
<a id='line_2525'>    Fidelity I bore the glorious office</a>
<a id='line_2526'>    So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.</a>
<a id='line_2527'></a>
<a id='line_2528'>The courtesan who never from the dwelling</a>
<a id='line_2529'>    Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,</a>
<a id='line_2530'>    Death universal and the vice of courts,</a>
<a id='line_2531'></a>
<a id='line_2532'>Inflamed against me all the other minds,</a>
<a id='line_2533'>    And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,</a>
<a id='line_2534'>    That my glad honours turned to dismal mournings.</a>
<a id='line_2535'></a>
<a id='line_2536'>My spirit, in disdainful exultation,</a>
<a id='line_2537'>    Thinking by dying to escape disdain,</a>
<a id='line_2538'>    Made me unjust against myself, the just.</a>
<a id='line_2539'></a>
<a id='line_2540'>I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,</a>
<a id='line_2541'>    Do swear to you that never broke I faith</a>
<a id='line_2542'>    Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour;</a>
<a id='line_2543'></a>
<a id='line_2544'>And to the world if one of you return,</a>
<a id='line_2545'>    Let him my memory comfort, which is lying</a>
<a id='line_2546'>    Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it.”</a>
<a id='line_2547'></a>
<a id='line_2548'>Waited awhile, and then: “Since he is silent,”</a>
<a id='line_2549'>    The Poet said to me, “lose not the time,</a>
<a id='line_2550'>    But speak, and question him, if more may please thee.”</a>
<a id='line_2551'></a>
<a id='line_2552'>Whence I to him: “Do thou again inquire</a>
<a id='line_2553'>    Concerning what thou thinks’t will satisfy me;</a>
<a id='line_2554'>    For I cannot, such pity is in my heart.”</a>
<a id='line_2555'></a>
<a id='line_2556'>Therefore he recommenced: “So may the man</a>
<a id='line_2557'>    Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,</a>
<a id='line_2558'>    Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased</a>
<a id='line_2559'></a>
<a id='line_2560'>To tell us in what way the soul is bound</a>
<a id='line_2561'>    Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,</a>
<a id='line_2562'>    If any from such members e’er is freed.”</a>
<a id='line_2563'></a>
<a id='line_2564'>Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward</a>
<a id='line_2565'>    The wind was into such a voice converted:</a>
<a id='line_2566'>    “With brevity shall be replied to you.</a>
<a id='line_2567'></a>
<a id='line_2568'>When the exasperated soul abandons</a>
<a id='line_2569'>    The body whence it rent itself away,</a>
<a id='line_2570'>    Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.</a>
<a id='line_2571'></a>
<a id='line_2572'>It falls into the forest, and no part</a>
<a id='line_2573'>    Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,</a>
<a id='line_2574'>    There like a grain of spelt it germinates.</a>
<a id='line_2575'></a>
<a id='line_2576'>It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;</a>
<a id='line_2577'>    The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,</a>
<a id='line_2578'>    Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.</a>
<a id='line_2579'></a>
<a id='line_2580'>Like others for our spoils shall we return;</a>
<a id='line_2581'>    But not that any one may them revest,</a>
<a id='line_2582'>    For ’tis not just to have what one casts off.</a>
<a id='line_2583'></a>
<a id='line_2584'>Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal</a>
<a id='line_2585'>    Forest our bodies shall suspended be,</a>
<a id='line_2586'>    Each to the thorn of his molested shade.”</a>
<a id='line_2587'></a>
<a id='line_2588'>We were attentive still unto the trunk,</a>
<a id='line_2589'>    Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,</a>
<a id='line_2590'>    When by a tumult we were overtaken,</a>
<a id='line_2591'></a>
<a id='line_2592'>In the same way as he is who perceives</a>
<a id='line_2593'>    The boar and chase approaching to his stand,</a>
<a id='line_2594'>    Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;</a>
<a id='line_2595'></a>
<a id='line_2596'>And two behold! upon our left-hand side,</a>
<a id='line_2597'>    Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,</a>
<a id='line_2598'>    That of the forest, every fan they broke.</a>
<a id='line_2599'></a>
<a id='line_2600'>He who was in advance: “Now help, Death, help!”</a>
<a id='line_2601'>    And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,</a>
<a id='line_2602'>    Was shouting: “Lano, were not so alert</a>
<a id='line_2603'></a>
<a id='line_2604'>Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!”</a>
<a id='line_2605'>    And then, perchance because his breath was failing,</a>
<a id='line_2606'>    He grouped himself together with a bush.</a>
<a id='line_2607'></a>
<a id='line_2608'>Behind them was the forest full of black</a>
<a id='line_2609'>    She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot</a>
<a id='line_2610'>    As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.</a>
<a id='line_2611'></a>
<a id='line_2612'>On him who had crouched down they set their teeth,</a>
<a id='line_2613'>    And him they lacerated piece by piece,</a>
<a id='line_2614'>    Thereafter bore away those aching members.</a>
<a id='line_2615'></a>
<a id='line_2616'>Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,</a>
<a id='line_2617'>    And led me to the bush, that all in vain</a>
<a id='line_2618'>    Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.</a>
<a id='line_2619'></a>
<a id='line_2620'>“O Jacopo,” it said, “of Sant’ Andrea,</a>
<a id='line_2621'>    What helped it thee of me to make a screen?</a>
<a id='line_2622'>    What blame have I in thy nefarious life?”</a>
<a id='line_2623'></a>
<a id='line_2624'>When near him had the Master stayed his steps,</a>
<a id='line_2625'>    He said: “Who wast thou, that through wounds so many</a>
<a id='line_2626'>    Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?”</a>
<a id='line_2627'></a>
<a id='line_2628'>And he to us: “O souls, that hither come</a>
<a id='line_2629'>    To look upon the shameful massacre</a>
<a id='line_2630'>    That has so rent away from me my leaves,</a>
<a id='line_2631'></a>
<a id='line_2632'>Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;</a>
<a id='line_2633'>    I of that city was which to the Baptist</a>
<a id='line_2634'>    Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this</a>
<a id='line_2635'></a>
<a id='line_2636'>Forever with his art will make it sad.</a>
<a id='line_2637'>    And were it not that on the pass of Arno</a>
<a id='line_2638'>    Some glimpses of him are remaining still,</a>
<a id='line_2639'></a>
<a id='line_2640'>Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it</a>
<a id='line_2641'>    Upon the ashes left by Attila,</a>
<a id='line_2642'>    In vain had caused their labour to be done.</a>
<a id='line_2643'></a>
<a id='line_2644'>Of my own house I made myself a gibbet.”</a>

<a id='line_2648'></a>
<a id='line_2649'>Inferno: Canto XIV</a>
<a id='line_2650'></a>
<a id='line_2651'></a>
<a id='line_2652'>Because the charity of my native place</a>
<a id='line_2653'>    Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,</a>
<a id='line_2654'>    And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.</a>
<a id='line_2655'></a>
<a id='line_2656'>Then came we to the confine, where disparted</a>
<a id='line_2657'>    The second round is from the third, and where</a>
<a id='line_2658'>    A horrible form of Justice is beheld.</a>
<a id='line_2659'></a>
<a id='line_2660'>Clearly to manifest these novel things,</a>
<a id='line_2661'>    I say that we arrived upon a plain,</a>

<a id='line_2665'>    All round about, as the sad moat to that;</a>
<a id='line_2666'>    There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.</a>
<a id='line_2667'></a>
<a id='line_2668'>The soil was of an arid and thick sand,</a>
<a id='line_2669'>    Not of another fashion made than that</a>
<a id='line_2670'>    Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.</a>
<a id='line_2671'></a>
<a id='line_2672'>Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou</a>
<a id='line_2673'>    By each one to be dreaded, who doth read</a>
<a id='line_2674'>    That which was manifest unto mine eyes!</a>
<a id='line_2675'></a>
<a id='line_2676'>Of naked souls beheld I many herds,</a>
<a id='line_2677'>    Who all were weeping very miserably,</a>
<a id='line_2678'>    And over them seemed set a law diverse.</a>
<a id='line_2679'></a>
<a id='line_2680'>Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;</a>
<a id='line_2681'>    And some were sitting all drawn up together,</a>
<a id='line_2682'>    And others went about continually.</a>
<a id='line_2683'></a>
<a id='line_2684'>Those who were going round were far the more,</a>
<a id='line_2685'>    And those were less who lay down to their torment,</a>
<a id='line_2686'>    But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.</a>
<a id='line_2687'></a>
<a id='line_2688'>O’er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,</a>
<a id='line_2689'>    Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,</a>
<a id='line_2690'>    As of the snow on Alp without a wind.</a>
<a id='line_2691'></a>
<a id='line_2692'>As Alexander, in those torrid parts</a>
<a id='line_2693'>    Of India, beheld upon his host</a>
<a id='line_2694'>    Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground.</a>
<a id='line_2695'></a>
<a id='line_2696'>Whence he provided with his phalanxes</a>
<a id='line_2697'>    To trample down the soil, because the vapour</a>
<a id='line_2698'>    Better extinguished was while it was single;</a>
<a id='line_2699'></a>
<a id='line_2700'>Thus was descending the eternal heat,</a>
<a id='line_2701'>    Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder</a>
<a id='line_2702'>    Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.</a>
<a id='line_2703'></a>
<a id='line_2704'>Without repose forever was the dance</a>
<a id='line_2705'>    Of miserable hands, now there, now here,</a>
<a id='line_2706'>    Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.</a>
<a id='line_2707'></a>
<a id='line_2708'>“Master,” began I, “thou who overcomest</a>

<a id='line_2714'>    So that the rain seems not to ripen him?”</a>
<a id='line_2715'></a>
<a id='line_2716'>And he himself, who had become aware</a>
<a id='line_2717'>    That I was questioning my Guide about him,</a>
<a id='line_2718'>    Cried: “Such as I was living, am I, dead.</a>
<a id='line_2719'></a>
<a id='line_2720'>If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom</a>
<a id='line_2721'>    He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,</a>
<a id='line_2722'>    Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,</a>
<a id='line_2723'></a>
<a id='line_2724'>And if he wearied out by turns the others</a>
<a id='line_2725'>    In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,</a>
<a id='line_2726'>    Vociferating, ‘Help, good Vulcan, help!’</a>
<a id='line_2727'></a>
<a id='line_2728'>Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,</a>
<a id='line_2729'>    And shot his bolts at me with all his might,</a>
<a id='line_2730'>    He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance.”</a>
<a id='line_2731'></a>
<a id='line_2732'>Then did my Leader speak with such great force,</a>
<a id='line_2733'>    That I had never heard him speak so loud:</a>
<a id='line_2734'>    “O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished</a>
<a id='line_2735'></a>
<a id='line_2736'>Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more;</a>
<a id='line_2737'>    Not any torment, saving thine own rage,</a>
<a id='line_2738'>    Would be unto thy fury pain complete.”</a>
<a id='line_2739'></a>
<a id='line_2740'>Then he turned round to me with better lip,</a>
<a id='line_2741'>    Saying: “One of the Seven Kings was he</a>
<a id='line_2742'>    Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold</a>
<a id='line_2743'></a>
<a id='line_2744'>God in disdain, and little seems to prize him;</a>
<a id='line_2745'>    But, as I said to him, his own despites</a>
<a id='line_2746'>    Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.</a>
<a id='line_2747'></a>
<a id='line_2748'>Now follow me, and mind thou do not place</a>
<a id='line_2749'>    As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,</a>
<a id='line_2750'>    But always keep them close unto the wood.”</a>
<a id='line_2751'></a>
<a id='line_2752'>Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes</a>
<a id='line_2753'>    Forth from the wood a little rivulet,</a>
<a id='line_2754'>    Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.</a>
<a id='line_2755'></a>
<a id='line_2756'>As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet,</a>
<a id='line_2757'>    The sinful women later share among them,</a>
<a id='line_2758'>    So downward through the sand it went its way.</a>
<a id='line_2759'></a>
<a id='line_2760'>The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,</a>
<a id='line_2761'>    Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;</a>
<a id='line_2762'>    Whence I perceived that there the passage was.</a>
<a id='line_2763'></a>
<a id='line_2764'>“In all the rest which I have shown to thee</a>
<a id='line_2765'>    Since we have entered in within the gate</a>
<a id='line_2766'>    Whose threshold unto no one is denied,</a>
<a id='line_2767'></a>
<a id='line_2768'>Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes</a>
<a id='line_2769'>    So notable as is the present river,</a>
<a id='line_2770'>    Which all the little flames above it quenches.”</a>
<a id='line_2771'></a>
<a id='line_2772'>These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him</a>
<a id='line_2773'>    That he would give me largess of the food,</a>
<a id='line_2774'>    For which he had given me largess of desire.</a>
<a id='line_2775'></a>
<a id='line_2776'>“In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,”</a>
<a id='line_2777'>    Said he thereafterward, “whose name is Crete,</a>
<a id='line_2778'>    Under whose king the world of old was chaste.</a>
<a id='line_2779'></a>
<a id='line_2780'>There is a mountain there, that once was glad</a>
<a id='line_2781'>    With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;</a>
<a id='line_2782'>    Now ’tis deserted, as a thing worn out.</a>
<a id='line_2783'></a>
<a id='line_2784'>Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle</a>
<a id='line_2785'>    Of her own son; and to conceal him better,</a>
<a id='line_2786'>    Whene’er he cried, she there had clamours made.</a>
<a id='line_2787'></a>
<a id='line_2788'>A grand old man stands in the mount erect,</a>
<a id='line_2789'>    Who holds his shoulders turned tow’rds Damietta,</a>
<a id='line_2790'>    And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.</a>
<a id='line_2791'></a>
<a id='line_2792'>His head is fashioned of refined gold,</a>
<a id='line_2793'>    And of pure silver are the arms and breast;</a>
<a id='line_2794'>    Then he is brass as far down as the fork.</a>
<a id='line_2795'></a>
<a id='line_2796'>From that point downward all is chosen iron,</a>
<a id='line_2797'>    Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,</a>
<a id='line_2798'>    And more he stands on that than on the other.</a>
<a id='line_2799'></a>
<a id='line_2800'>Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure</a>
<a id='line_2801'>    Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,</a>
<a id='line_2802'>    Which gathered together perforate that cavern.</a>
<a id='line_2803'></a>
<a id='line_2804'>From rock to rock they fall into this valley;</a>
<a id='line_2805'>    Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;</a>
<a id='line_2806'>    Then downward go along this narrow sluice</a>
<a id='line_2807'></a>
<a id='line_2808'>Unto that point where is no more descending.</a>
<a id='line_2809'>    They form Cocytus; what that pool may be</a>
<a id='line_2810'>    Thou shalt behold, so here ’tis not narrated.”</a>
<a id='line_2811'></a>
<a id='line_2812'>And I to him: “If so the present runnel</a>
<a id='line_2813'>    Doth take its rise in this way from our world,</a>
<a id='line_2814'>    Why only on this verge appears it to us?”</a>
<a id='line_2815'></a>
<a id='line_2816'>And he to me: “Thou knowest the place is round,</a>
<a id='line_2817'>    And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,</a>
<a id='line_2818'>    Still to the left descending to the bottom,</a>
<a id='line_2819'></a>
<a id='line_2820'>Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned.</a>
<a id='line_2821'>    Therefore if something new appear to us,</a>
<a id='line_2822'>    It should not bring amazement to thy face.”</a>
<a id='line_2823'></a>
<a id='line_2824'>And I again: “Master, where shall be found</a>
<a id='line_2825'>    Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou’rt silent,</a>
<a id='line_2826'>    And sayest the other of this rain is made?”</a>
<a id='line_2827'></a>
<a id='line_2828'>“In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,”</a>
<a id='line_2829'>    Replied he; “but the boiling of the red</a>
<a id='line_2830'>    Water might well solve one of them thou makest.</a>
<a id='line_2831'></a>
<a id='line_2832'>Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,</a>
<a id='line_2833'>    There where the souls repair to lave themselves,</a>
<a id='line_2834'>    When sin repented of has been removed.”</a>
<a id='line_2835'></a>
<a id='line_2836'>Then said he: “It is time now to abandon</a>
<a id='line_2837'>    The wood; take heed that thou come after me;</a>
<a id='line_2838'>    A way the margins make that are not burning,</a>
<a id='line_2839'></a>
<a id='line_2840'>And over them all vapours are extinguished.”</a>
<a id='line_2841'></a>
<a id='line_2842'></a>
<a id='line_2843'></a>
<a id='line_2844'></a>
<a id='line_2845'>Inferno: Canto XV</a>
<a id='line_2846'></a>
<a id='line_2847'></a>
<a id='line_2848'>Now bears us onward one of the hard margins,</a>
<a id='line_2849'>    And so the brooklet’s mist o’ershadows it,</a>
<a id='line_2850'>    From fire it saves the water and the dikes.</a>
<a id='line_2851'></a>
<a id='line_2852'>Even as the Flemings, ’twixt Cadsand and Bruges,</a>
<a id='line_2853'>    Fearing the flood that tow’rds them hurls itself,</a>
<a id='line_2854'>    Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;</a>
<a id='line_2855'></a>
<a id='line_2856'>And as the Paduans along the Brenta,</a>
<a id='line_2857'>    To guard their villas and their villages,</a>
<a id='line_2858'>    Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;</a>
<a id='line_2859'></a>
<a id='line_2860'>In such similitude had those been made,</a>
<a id='line_2861'>    Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,</a>
<a id='line_2862'>    Whoever he might be, the master made them.</a>
<a id='line_2863'></a>
<a id='line_2864'>Now were we from the forest so remote,</a>
<a id='line_2865'>    I could not have discovered where it was,</a>
<a id='line_2866'>    Even if backward I had turned myself,</a>
<a id='line_2867'></a>
<a id='line_2868'>When we a company of souls encountered,</a>
<a id='line_2869'>    Who came beside the dike, and every one</a>
<a id='line_2870'>    Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont</a>
<a id='line_2871'></a>
<a id='line_2872'>To eye each other under a new moon,</a>
<a id='line_2873'>    And so towards us sharpened they their brows</a>
<a id='line_2874'>    As an old tailor at the needle’s eye.</a>
<a id='line_2875'></a>
<a id='line_2876'>Thus scrutinised by such a family,</a>
<a id='line_2877'>    By some one I was recognised, who seized</a>
<a id='line_2878'>    My garment’s hem, and cried out, “What a marvel!”</a>
<a id='line_2879'></a>
<a id='line_2880'>And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,</a>
<a id='line_2881'>    On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,</a>
<a id='line_2882'>    That the scorched countenance prevented not</a>
<a id='line_2883'></a>
<a id='line_2884'>His recognition by my intellect;</a>
<a id='line_2885'>    And bowing down my face unto his own,</a>
<a id='line_2886'>    I made reply, “Are you here, Ser Brunetto?”</a>
<a id='line_2887'></a>
<a id='line_2888'>And he: “May’t not displease thee, O my son,</a>
<a id='line_2889'>    If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini</a>
<a id='line_2890'>    Backward return and let the trail go on.”</a>
<a id='line_2891'></a>
<a id='line_2892'>I said to him: “With all my power I ask it;</a>
<a id='line_2893'>    And if you wish me to sit down with you,</a>
<a id='line_2894'>    I will, if he please, for I go with him.”</a>
<a id='line_2895'></a>
<a id='line_2896'>“O son,” he said, “whoever of this herd</a>
<a id='line_2897'>    A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,</a>
<a id='line_2898'>    Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.</a>
<a id='line_2899'></a>
<a id='line_2900'>Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,</a>
<a id='line_2901'>    And afterward will I rejoin my band,</a>
<a id='line_2902'>    Which goes lamenting its eternal doom.”</a>
<a id='line_2903'></a>
<a id='line_2904'>I did not dare to go down from the road</a>
<a id='line_2905'>    Level to walk with him; but my head bowed</a>
<a id='line_2906'>    I held as one who goeth reverently.</a>
<a id='line_2907'></a>
<a id='line_2908'>And he began: “What fortune or what fate</a>
<a id='line_2909'>    Before the last day leadeth thee down here?</a>
<a id='line_2910'>    And who is this that showeth thee the way?”</a>
<a id='line_2911'></a>
<a id='line_2912'>“Up there above us in the life serene,”</a>
<a id='line_2913'>    I answered him, “I lost me in a valley,</a>
<a id='line_2914'>    Or ever yet my age had been completed.</a>
<a id='line_2915'></a>
<a id='line_2916'>But yestermorn I turned my back upon it;</a>
<a id='line_2917'>    This one appeared to me, returning thither,</a>
<a id='line_2918'>    And homeward leadeth me along this road.”</a>
<a id='line_2919'></a>
<a id='line_2920'>And he to me: “If thou thy star do follow,</a>
<a id='line_2921'>    Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,</a>
<a id='line_2922'>    If well I judged in the life beautiful.</a>
<a id='line_2923'></a>
<a id='line_2924'>And if I had not died so prematurely,</a>
<a id='line_2925'>    Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,</a>
<a id='line_2926'>    I would have given thee comfort in the work.</a>
<a id='line_2927'></a>
<a id='line_2928'>But that ungrateful and malignant people,</a>
<a id='line_2929'>    Which of old time from Fesole descended,</a>
<a id='line_2930'>    And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,</a>
<a id='line_2931'></a>
<a id='line_2932'>Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;</a>
<a id='line_2933'>    And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs</a>
<a id='line_2934'>    It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.</a>
<a id='line_2935'></a>
<a id='line_2936'>Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind;</a>
<a id='line_2937'>    A people avaricious, envious, proud;</a>
<a id='line_2938'>    Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.</a>
<a id='line_2939'></a>
<a id='line_2940'>Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee,</a>
<a id='line_2941'>    One party and the other shall be hungry</a>
<a id='line_2942'>    For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.</a>
<a id='line_2943'></a>
<a id='line_2944'>Their litter let the beasts of Fesole</a>
<a id='line_2945'>    Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,</a>
<a id='line_2946'>    If any still upon their dunghill rise,</a>
<a id='line_2947'></a>
<a id='line_2948'>In which may yet revive the consecrated</a>
<a id='line_2949'>    Seed of those Romans, who remained there when</a>
<a id='line_2950'>    The nest of such great malice it became.”</a>
<a id='line_2951'></a>
<a id='line_2952'>“If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,”</a>
<a id='line_2953'>    Replied I to him, “not yet would you be</a>
<a id='line_2954'>    In banishment from human nature placed;</a>
<a id='line_2955'></a>
<a id='line_2956'>For in my mind is fixed, and touches now</a>
<a id='line_2957'>    My heart the dear and good paternal image</a>
<a id='line_2958'>    Of you, when in the world from hour to hour</a>
<a id='line_2959'></a>
<a id='line_2960'>You taught me how a man becomes eternal;</a>
<a id='line_2961'>    And how much I am grateful, while I live</a>
<a id='line_2962'>    Behoves that in my language be discerned.</a>
<a id='line_2963'></a>
<a id='line_2964'>What you narrate of my career I write,</a>
<a id='line_2965'>    And keep it to be glossed with other text</a>
<a id='line_2966'>    By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.</a>
<a id='line_2967'></a>
<a id='line_2968'>This much will I have manifest to you;</a>
<a id='line_2969'>    Provided that my conscience do not chide me,</a>
<a id='line_2970'>    For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.</a>
<a id='line_2971'></a>
<a id='line_2972'>Such handsel is not new unto mine ears;</a>
<a id='line_2973'>    Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around</a>
<a id='line_2974'>    As it may please her, and the churl his mattock.”</a>
<a id='line_2975'></a>
<a id='line_2976'>My Master thereupon on his right cheek</a>
<a id='line_2977'>    Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;</a>
<a id='line_2978'>    Then said: “He listeneth well who noteth it.”</a>
<a id='line_2979'></a>
<a id='line_2980'>Nor speaking less on that account, I go</a>
<a id='line_2981'>    With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are</a>
<a id='line_2982'>    His most known and most eminent companions.</a>
<a id='line_2983'></a>
<a id='line_2984'>And he to me: “To know of some is well;</a>
<a id='line_2985'>    Of others it were laudable to be silent,</a>
<a id='line_2986'>    For short would be the time for so much speech.</a>
<a id='line_2987'></a>
<a id='line_2988'>Know them in sum, that all of them were clerks,</a>
<a id='line_2989'>    And men of letters great and of great fame,</a>
<a id='line_2990'>    In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.</a>
<a id='line_2991'></a>
<a id='line_2992'>Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,</a>
<a id='line_2993'>    And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there</a>
<a id='line_2994'>    If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,</a>
<a id='line_2995'></a>
<a id='line_2996'>That one, who by the Servant of the Servants</a>
<a id='line_2997'>    From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,</a>
<a id='line_2998'>    Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.</a>
<a id='line_2999'></a>
<a id='line_3000'>More would I say, but coming and discoursing</a>
<a id='line_3001'>    Can be no longer; for that I behold</a>
<a id='line_3002'>    New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.</a>
<a id='line_3003'></a>
<a id='line_3004'>A people comes with whom I may not be;</a>
<a id='line_3005'>    Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,</a>
<a id='line_3006'>    In which I still live, and no more I ask.”</a>
<a id='line_3007'></a>
<a id='line_3008'>Then he turned round, and seemed to be of those</a>
<a id='line_3009'>    Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle</a>
<a id='line_3010'>    Across the plain; and seemed to be among them</a>
<a id='line_3011'></a>

<a id='line_3020'>Now was I where was heard the reverberation</a>
<a id='line_3021'>    Of water falling into the next round,</a>
<a id='line_3022'>    Like to that humming which the beehives make,</a>
<a id='line_3023'></a>
<a id='line_3024'>When shadows three together started forth,</a>
<a id='line_3025'>    Running, from out a company that passed</a>
<a id='line_3026'>    Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.</a>
<a id='line_3027'></a>
<a id='line_3028'>Towards us came they, and each one cried out:</a>
<a id='line_3029'>    “Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest</a>

<a id='line_3031'></a>
<a id='line_3032'>Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs,</a>
<a id='line_3033'>    Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!</a>
<a id='line_3034'>    It pains me still but to remember it.</a>
<a id='line_3035'></a>
<a id='line_3036'>Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;</a>
<a id='line_3037'>    He turned his face towards me, and “Now wait,”</a>
<a id='line_3038'>    He said; “to these we should be courteous.</a>
<a id='line_3039'></a>
<a id='line_3040'>And if it were not for the fire that darts</a>
<a id='line_3041'>    The nature of this region, I should say</a>
<a id='line_3042'>    That haste were more becoming thee than them.”</a>
<a id='line_3043'></a>
<a id='line_3044'>As soon as we stood still, they recommenced</a>
<a id='line_3045'>    The old refrain, and when they overtook us,</a>
<a id='line_3046'>    Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.</a>
<a id='line_3047'></a>
<a id='line_3048'>As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,</a>
<a id='line_3049'>    Watching for their advantage and their hold,</a>
<a id='line_3050'>    Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,</a>
<a id='line_3051'></a>
<a id='line_3052'>Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage</a>
<a id='line_3053'>    Direct to me, so that in opposite wise</a>
<a id='line_3054'>    His neck and feet continual journey made.</a>
<a id='line_3055'></a>
<a id='line_3056'>And, “If the misery of this soft place</a>
<a id='line_3057'>    Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,”</a>
<a id='line_3058'>    Began one, “and our aspect black and blistered,</a>
<a id='line_3059'></a>
<a id='line_3060'>Let the renown of us thy mind incline</a>
<a id='line_3061'>    To tell us who thou art, who thus securely</a>
<a id='line_3062'>    Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.</a>
<a id='line_3063'></a>
<a id='line_3064'>He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,</a>
<a id='line_3065'>    Naked and skinless though he now may go,</a>
<a id='line_3066'>    Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;</a>
<a id='line_3067'></a>
<a id='line_3068'>He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;</a>
<a id='line_3069'>    His name was Guidoguerra, and in life</a>
<a id='line_3070'>    Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.</a>
<a id='line_3071'></a>
<a id='line_3072'>The other, who close by me treads the sand,</a>
<a id='line_3073'>    Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame</a>
<a id='line_3074'>    Above there in the world should welcome be.</a>
<a id='line_3075'></a>
<a id='line_3076'>And I, who with them on the cross am placed,</a>
<a id='line_3077'>    Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly</a>
<a id='line_3078'>    My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me.”</a>
<a id='line_3079'></a>
<a id='line_3080'>Could I have been protected from the fire,</a>
<a id='line_3081'>    Below I should have thrown myself among them,</a>
<a id='line_3082'>    And think the Teacher would have suffered it;</a>
<a id='line_3083'></a>
<a id='line_3084'>But as I should have burned and baked myself,</a>
<a id='line_3085'>    My terror overmastered my good will,</a>
<a id='line_3086'>    Which made me greedy of embracing them.</a>
<a id='line_3087'></a>
<a id='line_3088'>Then I began: “Sorrow and not disdain</a>
<a id='line_3089'>    Did your condition fix within me so,</a>
<a id='line_3090'>    That tardily it wholly is stripped off,</a>
<a id='line_3091'></a>
<a id='line_3092'>As soon as this my Lord said unto me</a>
<a id='line_3093'>    Words, on account of which I thought within me</a>
<a id='line_3094'>    That people such as you are were approaching.</a>
<a id='line_3095'></a>
<a id='line_3096'>I of your city am; and evermore</a>
<a id='line_3097'>    Your labours and your honourable names</a>
<a id='line_3098'>    I with affection have retraced and heard.</a>
<a id='line_3099'></a>
<a id='line_3100'>I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits</a>
<a id='line_3101'>    Promised to me by the veracious Leader;</a>
<a id='line_3102'>    But to the centre first I needs must plunge.”</a>
<a id='line_3103'></a>
<a id='line_3104'>“So may the soul for a long while conduct</a>
<a id='line_3105'>    Those limbs of thine,” did he make answer then,</a>
<a id='line_3106'>    “And so may thy renown shine after thee,</a>
<a id='line_3107'></a>
<a id='line_3108'>Valour and courtesy, say if they dwell</a>
<a id='line_3109'>    Within our city, as they used to do,</a>
<a id='line_3110'>    Or if they wholly have gone out of it;</a>
<a id='line_3111'></a>
<a id='line_3112'>For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment</a>
<a id='line_3113'>    With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,</a>
<a id='line_3114'>    Doth greatly mortify us with his words.”</a>
<a id='line_3115'></a>
<a id='line_3116'>“The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,</a>
<a id='line_3117'>    Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,</a>
<a id='line_3118'>    Florence, so that thou weep’st thereat already!”</a>
<a id='line_3119'></a>
<a id='line_3120'>In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;</a>
<a id='line_3121'>    And the three, taking that for my reply,</a>
<a id='line_3122'>    Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.</a>
<a id='line_3123'></a>
<a id='line_3124'>“If other times so little it doth cost thee,”</a>
<a id='line_3125'>    Replied they all, “to satisfy another,</a>
<a id='line_3126'>    Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!</a>
<a id='line_3127'></a>
<a id='line_3128'>Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places,</a>
<a id='line_3129'>    And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,</a>
<a id='line_3130'>    When it shall pleasure thee to say, ‘I was,’</a>
<a id='line_3131'></a>
<a id='line_3132'>See that thou speak of us unto the people.”</a>
<a id='line_3133'>    Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight</a>
<a id='line_3134'>    It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.</a>
<a id='line_3135'></a>
<a id='line_3136'>Not an Amen could possibly be said</a>
<a id='line_3137'>    So rapidly as they had disappeared;</a>
<a id='line_3138'>    Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.</a>
<a id='line_3139'></a>
<a id='line_3140'>I followed him, and little had we gone,</a>
<a id='line_3141'>    Before the sound of water was so near us,</a>
<a id='line_3142'>    That speaking we should hardly have been heard.</a>
<a id='line_3143'></a>
<a id='line_3144'>Even as that stream which holdeth its own course</a>
<a id='line_3145'>    The first from Monte Veso tow’rds the East,</a>
<a id='line_3146'>    Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,</a>
<a id='line_3147'></a>
<a id='line_3148'>Which is above called Acquacheta, ere</a>
<a id='line_3149'>    It down descendeth into its low bed,</a>
<a id='line_3150'>    And at Forli is vacant of that name,</a>
<a id='line_3151'></a>
<a id='line_3152'>Reverberates there above San Benedetto</a>
<a id='line_3153'>    From Alps, by falling at a single leap,</a>
<a id='line_3154'>    Where for a thousand there were room enough;</a>
<a id='line_3155'></a>
<a id='line_3156'>Thus downward from a bank precipitate,</a>
<a id='line_3157'>    We found resounding that dark-tinted water,</a>
<a id='line_3158'>    So that it soon the ear would have offended.</a>
<a id='line_3159'></a>
<a id='line_3160'>I had a cord around about me girt,</a>
<a id='line_3161'>    And therewithal I whilom had designed</a>
<a id='line_3162'>    To take the panther with the painted skin.</a>
<a id='line_3163'></a>
<a id='line_3164'>After I this had all from me unloosed,</a>
<a id='line_3165'>    As my Conductor had commanded me,</a>
<a id='line_3166'>    I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,</a>
<a id='line_3167'></a>
<a id='line_3168'>Whereat he turned himself to the right side,</a>
<a id='line_3169'>    And at a little distance from the verge,</a>
<a id='line_3170'>    He cast it down into that deep abyss.</a>
<a id='line_3171'></a>
<a id='line_3172'>“It must needs be some novelty respond,”</a>
<a id='line_3173'>    I said within myself, “to the new signal</a>
<a id='line_3174'>    The Master with his eye is following so.”</a>
<a id='line_3175'></a>
<a id='line_3176'>Ah me! how very cautious men should be</a>
<a id='line_3177'>    With those who not alone behold the act,</a>
<a id='line_3178'>    But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!</a>
<a id='line_3179'></a>
<a id='line_3180'>He said to me: “Soon there will upward come</a>
<a id='line_3181'>    What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming</a>
<a id='line_3182'>    Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight.”</a>
<a id='line_3183'></a>
<a id='line_3184'>Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,</a>
<a id='line_3185'>    A man should close his lips as far as may be,</a>
<a id='line_3186'>    Because without his fault it causes shame;</a>
<a id='line_3187'></a>
<a id='line_3188'>But here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes</a>
<a id='line_3189'>    Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,</a>
<a id='line_3190'>    So may they not be void of lasting favour,</a>
<a id='line_3191'></a>
<a id='line_3192'>Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere</a>
<a id='line_3193'>    I saw a figure swimming upward come,</a>
<a id='line_3194'>    Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,</a>
<a id='line_3195'></a>
<a id='line_3196'>Even as he returns who goeth down</a>
<a id='line_3197'>    Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled</a>
<a id='line_3198'>    Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,</a>
<a id='line_3199'></a>
<a id='line_3200'>Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet.</a>
<a id='line_3201'></a>
<a id='line_3202'></a>

<a id='line_3204'></a>
<a id='line_3205'>Inferno: Canto XVII</a>
<a id='line_3206'></a>
<a id='line_3207'></a>
<a id='line_3208'>“Behold the monster with the pointed tail,</a>
<a id='line_3209'>    Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons,</a>
<a id='line_3210'>    Behold him who infecteth all the world.”</a>
<a id='line_3211'></a>
<a id='line_3212'>Thus unto me my Guide began to say,</a>
<a id='line_3213'>    And beckoned him that he should come to shore,</a>
<a id='line_3214'>    Near to the confine of the trodden marble;</a>
<a id='line_3215'></a>
<a id='line_3216'>And that uncleanly image of deceit</a>
<a id='line_3217'>    Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,</a>
<a id='line_3218'>    But on the border did not drag its tail.</a>
<a id='line_3219'></a>
<a id='line_3220'>The face was as the face of a just man,</a>
<a id='line_3221'>    Its semblance outwardly was so benign,</a>
<a id='line_3222'>    And of a serpent all the trunk beside.</a>
<a id='line_3223'></a>
<a id='line_3224'>Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;</a>
<a id='line_3225'>    The back, and breast, and both the sides it had</a>
<a id='line_3226'>    Depicted o’er with nooses and with shields.</a>
<a id='line_3227'></a>
<a id='line_3228'>With colours more, groundwork or broidery</a>
<a id='line_3229'>    Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,</a>
<a id='line_3230'>    Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.</a>
<a id='line_3231'></a>
<a id='line_3232'>As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,</a>
<a id='line_3233'>    That part are in the water, part on land;</a>
<a id='line_3234'>    And as among the guzzling Germans there,</a>
<a id='line_3235'></a>
<a id='line_3236'>The beaver plants himself to wage his war;</a>
<a id='line_3237'>    So that vile monster lay upon the border,</a>
<a id='line_3238'>    Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand.</a>
<a id='line_3239'></a>
<a id='line_3240'>His tail was wholly quivering in the void,</a>
<a id='line_3241'>    Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,</a>
<a id='line_3242'>    That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.</a>
<a id='line_3243'></a>
<a id='line_3244'>The Guide said: “Now perforce must turn aside</a>
<a id='line_3245'>    Our way a little, even to that beast</a>
<a id='line_3246'>    Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him.”</a>
<a id='line_3247'></a>
<a id='line_3248'>We therefore on the right side descended,</a>
<a id='line_3249'>    And made ten steps upon the outer verge,</a>
<a id='line_3250'>    Completely to avoid the sand and flame;</a>
<a id='line_3251'></a>
<a id='line_3252'>And after we are come to him, I see</a>
<a id='line_3253'>    A little farther off upon the sand</a>
<a id='line_3254'>    A people sitting near the hollow place.</a>
<a id='line_3255'></a>
<a id='line_3256'>Then said to me the Master: “So that full</a>
<a id='line_3257'>    Experience of this round thou bear away,</a>
<a id='line_3258'>    Now go and see what their condition is.</a>
<a id='line_3259'></a>
<a id='line_3260'>There let thy conversation be concise;</a>
<a id='line_3261'>    Till thou returnest I will speak with him,</a>
<a id='line_3262'>    That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders.”</a>
<a id='line_3263'></a>
<a id='line_3264'>Thus farther still upon the outermost</a>
<a id='line_3265'>    Head of that seventh circle all alone</a>
<a id='line_3266'>    I went, where sat the melancholy folk.</a>
<a id='line_3267'></a>
<a id='line_3268'>Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;</a>
<a id='line_3269'>    This way, that way, they helped them with their hands</a>
<a id='line_3270'>    Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.</a>
<a id='line_3271'></a>
<a id='line_3272'>Not otherwise in summer do the dogs,</a>
<a id='line_3273'>    Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when</a>
<a id='line_3274'>    By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.</a>
<a id='line_3275'></a>
<a id='line_3276'>When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces</a>
<a id='line_3277'>    Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,</a>
<a id='line_3278'>    Not one of them I knew; but I perceived</a>
<a id='line_3279'></a>
<a id='line_3280'>That from the neck of each there hung a pouch,</a>
<a id='line_3281'>    Which certain colour had, and certain blazon;</a>
<a id='line_3282'>    And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.</a>
<a id='line_3283'></a>
<a id='line_3284'>And as I gazing round me come among them,</a>
<a id='line_3285'>    Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw</a>
<a id='line_3286'>    That had the face and posture of a lion.</a>
<a id='line_3287'></a>
<a id='line_3288'>Proceeding then the current of my sight,</a>
<a id='line_3289'>    Another of them saw I, red as blood,</a>
<a id='line_3290'>    Display a goose more white than butter is.</a>
<a id='line_3291'></a>
<a id='line_3292'>And one, who with an azure sow and gravid</a>
<a id='line_3293'>    Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,</a>
<a id='line_3294'>    Said unto me: “What dost thou in this moat?</a>
<a id='line_3295'></a>
<a id='line_3296'>Now get thee gone; and since thou’rt still alive,</a>
<a id='line_3297'>    Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano,</a>
<a id='line_3298'>    Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.</a>
<a id='line_3299'></a>
<a id='line_3300'>A Paduan am I with these Florentines;</a>
<a id='line_3301'>    Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,</a>
<a id='line_3302'>    Exclaiming, ‘Come the sovereign cavalier,</a>
<a id='line_3303'></a>
<a id='line_3304'>He who shall bring the satchel with three goats;’”</a>
<a id='line_3305'>    Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust</a>
<a id='line_3306'>    His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.</a>
<a id='line_3307'></a>
<a id='line_3308'>And fearing lest my longer stay might vex</a>
<a id='line_3309'>    Him who had warned me not to tarry long,</a>
<a id='line_3310'>    Backward I turned me from those weary souls.</a>
<a id='line_3311'></a>
<a id='line_3312'>I found my Guide, who had already mounted</a>
<a id='line_3313'>    Upon the back of that wild animal,</a>
<a id='line_3314'>    And said to me: “Now be both strong and bold.</a>
<a id='line_3315'></a>
<a id='line_3316'>Now we descend by stairways such as these;</a>
<a id='line_3317'>    Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,</a>
<a id='line_3318'>    So that the tail may have no power to harm thee.”</a>
<a id='line_3319'></a>
<a id='line_3320'>Such as he is who has so near the ague</a>
<a id='line_3321'>    Of quartan that his nails are blue already,</a>
<a id='line_3322'>    And trembles all, but looking at the shade;</a>
<a id='line_3323'></a>
<a id='line_3324'>Even such became I at those proffered words;</a>
<a id='line_3325'>    But shame in me his menaces produced,</a>
<a id='line_3326'>    Which maketh servant strong before good master.</a>
<a id='line_3327'></a>
<a id='line_3328'>I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;</a>
<a id='line_3329'>    I wished to say, and yet the voice came not</a>
<a id='line_3330'>    As I believed, “Take heed that thou embrace me.”</a>
<a id='line_3331'></a>
<a id='line_3332'>But he, who other times had rescued me</a>
<a id='line_3333'>    In other peril, soon as I had mounted,</a>
<a id='line_3334'>    Within his arms encircled and sustained me,</a>
<a id='line_3335'></a>
<a id='line_3336'>And said: “Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;</a>
<a id='line_3337'>    The circles large, and the descent be little;</a>
<a id='line_3338'>    Think of the novel burden which thou hast.”</a>
<a id='line_3339'></a>
<a id='line_3340'>Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,</a>
<a id='line_3341'>    Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;</a>
<a id='line_3342'>    And when he wholly felt himself afloat,</a>
<a id='line_3343'></a>
<a id='line_3344'>There where his breast had been he turned his tail,</a>
<a id='line_3345'>    And that extended like an eel he moved,</a>
<a id='line_3346'>    And with his paws drew to himself the air.</a>
<a id='line_3347'></a>
<a id='line_3348'>A greater fear I do not think there was</a>
<a id='line_3349'>    What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,</a>
<a id='line_3350'>    Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;</a>
<a id='line_3351'></a>
<a id='line_3352'>Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks</a>
<a id='line_3353'>    Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,</a>
<a id='line_3354'>    His father crying, “An ill way thou takest!”</a>
<a id='line_3355'></a>
<a id='line_3356'>Than was my own, when I perceived myself</a>
<a id='line_3357'>    On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished</a>
<a id='line_3358'>    The sight of everything but of the monster.</a>
<a id='line_3359'></a>
<a id='line_3360'>Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;</a>
<a id='line_3361'>    Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only</a>
<a id='line_3362'>    By wind upon my face and from below.</a>
<a id='line_3363'></a>
<a id='line_3364'>I heard already on the right the whirlpool</a>
<a id='line_3365'>    Making a horrible crashing under us;</a>
<a id='line_3366'>    Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.</a>
<a id='line_3367'></a>
<a id='line_3368'>Then was I still more fearful of the abyss;</a>
<a id='line_3369'>    Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,</a>
<a id='line_3370'>    Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.</a>
<a id='line_3371'></a>
<a id='line_3372'>I saw then, for before I had not seen it,</a>
<a id='line_3373'>    The turning and descending, by great horrors</a>
<a id='line_3374'>    That were approaching upon divers sides.</a>
<a id='line_3375'></a>
<a id='line_3376'>As falcon who has long been on the wing,</a>
<a id='line_3377'>    Who, without seeing either lure or bird,</a>
<a id='line_3378'>    Maketh the falconer say, “Ah me, thou stoopest,”</a>
<a id='line_3379'></a>
<a id='line_3380'>Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,</a>
<a id='line_3381'>    Thorough a hundred circles, and alights</a>
<a id='line_3382'>    Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;</a>
<a id='line_3383'></a>
<a id='line_3384'>Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,</a>
<a id='line_3385'>    Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,</a>
<a id='line_3386'>    And being disencumbered of our persons,</a>
<a id='line_3387'></a>
<a id='line_3388'>He sped away as arrow from the string.</a>

<a id='line_3395'></a>
<a id='line_3396'>There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,</a>
<a id='line_3397'>    Wholly of stone and of an iron colour,</a>
<a id='line_3398'>    As is the circle that around it turns.</a>
<a id='line_3399'></a>
<a id='line_3400'>Right in the middle of the field malign</a>
<a id='line_3401'>    There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,</a>
<a id='line_3402'>    Of which its place the structure will recount.</a>
<a id='line_3403'></a>
<a id='line_3404'>Round, then, is that enclosure which remains</a>
<a id='line_3405'>    Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,</a>
<a id='line_3406'>    And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.</a>
<a id='line_3407'></a>
<a id='line_3408'>As where for the protection of the walls</a>
<a id='line_3409'>    Many and many moats surround the castles,</a>
<a id='line_3410'>    The part in which they are a figure forms,</a>
<a id='line_3411'></a>
<a id='line_3412'>Just such an image those presented there;</a>
<a id='line_3413'>    And as about such strongholds from their gates</a>
<a id='line_3414'>    Unto the outer bank are little bridges,</a>
<a id='line_3415'></a>
<a id='line_3416'>So from the precipice’s base did crags</a>
<a id='line_3417'>    Project, which intersected dikes and moats,</a>
<a id='line_3418'>    Unto the well that truncates and collects them.</a>
<a id='line_3419'></a>
<a id='line_3420'>Within this place, down shaken from the back</a>
<a id='line_3421'>    Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet</a>
<a id='line_3422'>    Held to the left, and I moved on behind.</a>
<a id='line_3423'></a>
<a id='line_3424'>Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish,</a>
<a id='line_3425'>    New torments, and new wielders of the lash,</a>
<a id='line_3426'>    Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.</a>
<a id='line_3427'></a>
<a id='line_3428'>Down at the bottom were the sinners naked;</a>
<a id='line_3429'>    This side the middle came they facing us,</a>
<a id='line_3430'>    Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;</a>
<a id='line_3431'></a>
<a id='line_3432'>Even as the Romans, for the mighty host,</a>
<a id='line_3433'>    The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,</a>
<a id='line_3434'>    Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;</a>
<a id='line_3435'></a>
<a id='line_3436'>For all upon one side towards the Castle</a>
<a id='line_3437'>    Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter’s;</a>
<a id='line_3438'>    On the other side they go towards the Mountain.</a>
<a id='line_3439'></a>
<a id='line_3440'>This side and that, along the livid stone</a>
<a id='line_3441'>    Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,</a>
<a id='line_3442'>    Who cruelly were beating them behind.</a>
<a id='line_3443'></a>
<a id='line_3444'>Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs</a>
<a id='line_3445'>    At the first blows! and sooth not any one</a>
<a id='line_3446'>    The second waited for, nor for the third.</a>
<a id='line_3447'></a>
<a id='line_3448'>While I was going on, mine eyes by one</a>
<a id='line_3449'>    Encountered were; and straight I said: “Already</a>
<a id='line_3450'>    With sight of this one I am not unfed.”</a>
<a id='line_3451'></a>
<a id='line_3452'>Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,</a>
<a id='line_3453'>    And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,</a>
<a id='line_3454'>    And to my going somewhat back assented;</a>
<a id='line_3455'></a>
<a id='line_3456'>And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,</a>
<a id='line_3457'>    Lowering his face, but little it availed him;</a>
<a id='line_3458'>    For said I: “Thou that castest down thine eyes,</a>
<a id='line_3459'></a>
<a id='line_3460'>If false are not the features which thou bearest,</a>
<a id='line_3461'>    Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;</a>
<a id='line_3462'>    But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?”</a>
<a id='line_3463'></a>
<a id='line_3464'>And he to me: “Unwillingly I tell it;</a>
<a id='line_3465'>    But forces me thine utterance distinct,</a>
<a id='line_3466'>    Which makes me recollect the ancient world.</a>
<a id='line_3467'></a>
<a id='line_3468'>I was the one who the fair Ghisola</a>
<a id='line_3469'>    Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,</a>
<a id='line_3470'>    Howe’er the shameless story may be told.</a>
<a id='line_3471'></a>
<a id='line_3472'>Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;</a>
<a id='line_3473'>    Nay, rather is this place so full of them,</a>
<a id='line_3474'>    That not so many tongues to-day are taught</a>
<a id='line_3475'></a>
<a id='line_3476'>’Twixt Reno and Savena to say ‘sipa;’</a>
<a id='line_3477'>    And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,</a>
<a id='line_3478'>    Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart.”</a>
<a id='line_3479'></a>
<a id='line_3480'>While speaking in this manner, with his scourge</a>
<a id='line_3481'>    A demon smote him, and said: “Get thee gone</a>
<a id='line_3482'>    Pander, there are no women here for coin.”</a>
<a id='line_3483'></a>
<a id='line_3484'>I joined myself again unto mine Escort;</a>
<a id='line_3485'>    Thereafterward with footsteps few we came</a>
<a id='line_3486'>    To where a crag projected from the bank.</a>
<a id='line_3487'></a>
<a id='line_3488'>This very easily did we ascend,</a>
<a id='line_3489'>    And turning to the right along its ridge,</a>
<a id='line_3490'>    From those eternal circles we departed.</a>
<a id='line_3491'></a>
<a id='line_3492'>When we were there, where it is hollowed out</a>
<a id='line_3493'>    Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,</a>
<a id='line_3494'>    The Guide said: “Wait, and see that on thee strike</a>
<a id='line_3495'></a>
<a id='line_3496'>The vision of those others evil-born,</a>
<a id='line_3497'>    Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,</a>
<a id='line_3498'>    Because together with us they have gone.”</a>
<a id='line_3499'></a>
<a id='line_3500'>From the old bridge we looked upon the train</a>
<a id='line_3501'>    Which tow’rds us came upon the other border,</a>
<a id='line_3502'>    And which the scourges in like manner smite.</a>
<a id='line_3503'></a>
<a id='line_3504'>And the good Master, without my inquiring,</a>
<a id='line_3505'>    Said to me: “See that tall one who is coming,</a>
<a id='line_3506'>    And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;</a>
<a id='line_3507'></a>
<a id='line_3508'>Still what a royal aspect he retains!</a>
<a id='line_3509'>    That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning</a>
<a id='line_3510'>    The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.</a>
<a id='line_3511'></a>
<a id='line_3512'>He by the isle of Lemnos passed along</a>
<a id='line_3513'>    After the daring women pitiless</a>
<a id='line_3514'>    Had unto death devoted all their males.</a>
<a id='line_3515'></a>
<a id='line_3516'>There with his tokens and with ornate words</a>
<a id='line_3517'>    Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden</a>
<a id='line_3518'>    Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.</a>
<a id='line_3519'></a>
<a id='line_3520'>There did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;</a>
<a id='line_3521'>    Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,</a>
<a id='line_3522'>    And also for Medea is vengeance done.</a>
<a id='line_3523'></a>
<a id='line_3524'>With him go those who in such wise deceive;</a>
<a id='line_3525'>    And this sufficient be of the first valley</a>
<a id='line_3526'>    To know, and those that in its jaws it holds.”</a>
<a id='line_3527'></a>
<a id='line_3528'>We were already where the narrow path</a>
<a id='line_3529'>    Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms</a>
<a id='line_3530'>    Of that a buttress for another arch.</a>
<a id='line_3531'></a>
<a id='line_3532'>Thence we heard people, who are making moan</a>
<a id='line_3533'>    In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,</a>
<a id='line_3534'>    And with their palms beating upon themselves</a>
<a id='line_3535'></a>
<a id='line_3536'>The margins were incrusted with a mould</a>
<a id='line_3537'>    By exhalation from below, that sticks there,</a>
<a id='line_3538'>    And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.</a>
<a id='line_3539'></a>
<a id='line_3540'>The bottom is so deep, no place suffices</a>
<a id='line_3541'>    To give us sight of it, without ascending</a>
<a id='line_3542'>    The arch’s back, where most the crag impends.</a>
<a id='line_3543'></a>
<a id='line_3544'>Thither we came, and thence down in the moat</a>
<a id='line_3545'>    I saw a people smothered in a filth</a>
<a id='line_3546'>    That out of human privies seemed to flow;</a>
<a id='line_3547'></a>
<a id='line_3548'>And whilst below there with mine eye I search,</a>
<a id='line_3549'>    I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,</a>
<a id='line_3550'>    It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.</a>
<a id='line_3551'></a>
<a id='line_3552'>He screamed to me: “Wherefore art thou so eager</a>
<a id='line_3553'>    To look at me more than the other foul ones?”</a>
<a id='line_3554'>    And I to him: “Because, if I remember,</a>
<a id='line_3555'></a>
<a id='line_3556'>I have already seen thee with dry hair,</a>
<a id='line_3557'>    And thou’rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;</a>
<a id='line_3558'>    Therefore I eye thee more than all the others.”</a>
<a id='line_3559'></a>
<a id='line_3560'>And he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin:</a>
<a id='line_3561'>    “The flatteries have submerged me here below,</a>
<a id='line_3562'>    Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited.”</a>
<a id='line_3563'></a>
<a id='line_3564'>Then said to me the Guide: “See that thou thrust</a>
<a id='line_3565'>    Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,</a>
<a id='line_3566'>    That with thine eyes thou well the face attain</a>
<a id='line_3567'></a>
<a id='line_3568'>Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,</a>
<a id='line_3569'>    Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,</a>
<a id='line_3570'>    And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.</a>
<a id='line_3571'></a>
<a id='line_3572'>Thais the harlot is it, who replied</a>
<a id='line_3573'>    Unto her paramour, when he said, ‘Have I</a>
<a id='line_3574'>    Great gratitude from thee?’—‘Nay, marvellous;’</a>
<a id='line_3575'></a>
<a id='line_3576'>And herewith let our sight be satisfied.”</a>
<a id='line_3577'></a>
<a id='line_3578'></a>
<a id='line_3579'></a>
<a id='line_3580'></a>
<a id='line_3581'>Inferno: Canto XIX</a>
<a id='line_3582'></a>
<a id='line_3583'></a>
<a id='line_3584'>O Simon Magus, O forlorn disciples,</a>
<a id='line_3585'>    Ye who the things of God, which ought to be</a>
<a id='line_3586'>    The brides of holiness, rapaciously</a>
<a id='line_3587'></a>
<a id='line_3588'>For silver and for gold do prostitute,</a>
<a id='line_3589'>    Now it behoves for you the trumpet sound,</a>
<a id='line_3590'>    Because in this third Bolgia ye abide.</a>
<a id='line_3591'></a>
<a id='line_3592'>We had already on the following tomb</a>
<a id='line_3593'>    Ascended to that portion of the crag</a>
<a id='line_3594'>    Which o’er the middle of the moat hangs plumb.</a>
<a id='line_3595'></a>
<a id='line_3596'>Wisdom supreme, O how great art thou showest</a>
<a id='line_3597'>    In heaven, in earth, and in the evil world,</a>
<a id='line_3598'>    And with what justice doth thy power distribute!</a>
<a id='line_3599'></a>
<a id='line_3600'>I saw upon the sides and on the bottom</a>
<a id='line_3601'>    The livid stone with perforations filled,</a>
<a id='line_3602'>    All of one size, and every one was round.</a>
<a id='line_3603'></a>
<a id='line_3604'>To me less ample seemed they not, nor greater</a>
<a id='line_3605'>    Than those that in my beautiful Saint John</a>
<a id='line_3606'>    Are fashioned for the place of the baptisers,</a>
<a id='line_3607'></a>
<a id='line_3608'>And one of which, not many years ago,</a>
<a id='line_3609'>    I broke for some one, who was drowning in it;</a>
<a id='line_3610'>    Be this a seal all men to undeceive.</a>
<a id='line_3611'></a>
<a id='line_3612'>Out of the mouth of each one there protruded</a>
<a id='line_3613'>    The feet of a transgressor, and the legs</a>
<a id='line_3614'>    Up to the calf, the rest within remained.</a>
<a id='line_3615'></a>
<a id='line_3616'>In all of them the soles were both on fire;</a>
<a id='line_3617'>    Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,</a>
<a id='line_3618'>    They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.</a>
<a id='line_3619'></a>
<a id='line_3620'>Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont</a>
<a id='line_3621'>    To move upon the outer surface only,</a>
<a id='line_3622'>    So likewise was it there from heel to point.</a>
<a id='line_3623'></a>
<a id='line_3624'>“Master, who is that one who writhes himself,</a>
<a id='line_3625'>    More than his other comrades quivering,”</a>
<a id='line_3626'>    I said, “and whom a redder flame is sucking?”</a>
<a id='line_3627'></a>
<a id='line_3628'>And he to me: “If thou wilt have me bear thee</a>
<a id='line_3629'>    Down there along that bank which lowest lies,</a>
<a id='line_3630'>    From him thou’lt know his errors and himself.”</a>
<a id='line_3631'></a>
<a id='line_3632'>And I: “What pleases thee, to me is pleasing;</a>
<a id='line_3633'>    Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not</a>
<a id='line_3634'>    From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken.”</a>
<a id='line_3635'></a>
<a id='line_3636'>Straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived;</a>
<a id='line_3637'>    We turned, and on the left-hand side descended</a>
<a id='line_3638'>    Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow.</a>
<a id='line_3639'></a>
<a id='line_3640'>And the good Master yet from off his haunch</a>
<a id='line_3641'>    Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me</a>
<a id='line_3642'>    Of him who so lamented with his shanks.</a>
<a id='line_3643'></a>
<a id='line_3644'>“Whoe’er thou art, that standest upside down,</a>
<a id='line_3645'>    O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,”</a>
<a id='line_3646'>    To say began I, “if thou canst, speak out.”</a>
<a id='line_3647'></a>
<a id='line_3648'>I stood even as the friar who is confessing</a>
<a id='line_3649'>    The false assassin, who, when he is fixed,</a>
<a id='line_3650'>    Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.</a>
<a id='line_3651'></a>
<a id='line_3652'>And he cried out: “Dost thou stand there already,</a>
<a id='line_3653'>    Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?</a>
<a id='line_3654'>    By many years the record lied to me.</a>
<a id='line_3655'></a>
<a id='line_3656'>Art thou so early satiate with that wealth,</a>
<a id='line_3657'>    For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud</a>
<a id='line_3658'>    The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?”</a>
<a id='line_3659'></a>
<a id='line_3660'>Such I became, as people are who stand,</a>
<a id='line_3661'>    Not comprehending what is answered them,</a>
<a id='line_3662'>    As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.</a>
<a id='line_3663'></a>
<a id='line_3664'>Then said Virgilius: “Say to him straightway,</a>
<a id='line_3665'>    ‘I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.’”</a>
<a id='line_3666'>    And I replied as was imposed on me.</a>
<a id='line_3667'></a>
<a id='line_3668'>Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,</a>
<a id='line_3669'>    Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation</a>
<a id='line_3670'>    Said to me: “Then what wantest thou of me?</a>
<a id='line_3671'></a>
<a id='line_3672'>If who I am thou carest so much to know,</a>
<a id='line_3673'>    That thou on that account hast crossed the bank,</a>
<a id='line_3674'>    Know that I vested was with the great mantle;</a>
<a id='line_3675'></a>
<a id='line_3676'>And truly was I son of the She-bear,</a>
<a id='line_3677'>    So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth</a>
<a id='line_3678'>    Above, and here myself, I pocketed.</a>
<a id='line_3679'></a>
<a id='line_3680'>Beneath my head the others are dragged down</a>
<a id='line_3681'>    Who have preceded me in simony,</a>
<a id='line_3682'>    Flattened along the fissure of the rock.</a>
<a id='line_3683'></a>
<a id='line_3684'>Below there I shall likewise fall, whenever</a>
<a id='line_3685'>    That one shall come who I believed thou wast,</a>
<a id='line_3686'>    What time the sudden question I proposed.</a>
<a id='line_3687'></a>
<a id='line_3688'>But longer I my feet already toast,</a>
<a id='line_3689'>    And here have been in this way upside down,</a>
<a id='line_3690'>    Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;</a>
<a id='line_3691'></a>
<a id='line_3692'>For after him shall come of fouler deed</a>
<a id='line_3693'>    From tow’rds the west a Pastor without law,</a>
<a id='line_3694'>    Such as befits to cover him and me.</a>
<a id='line_3695'></a>
<a id='line_3696'>New Jason will he be, of whom we read</a>
<a id='line_3697'>    In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,</a>
<a id='line_3698'>    So he who governs France shall be to this one.”</a>
<a id='line_3699'></a>
<a id='line_3700'>I do not know if I were here too bold,</a>
<a id='line_3701'>    That him I answered only in this metre:</a>
<a id='line_3702'>    “I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure</a>
<a id='line_3703'></a>
<a id='line_3704'>Our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,</a>
<a id='line_3705'>    Before he put the keys into his keeping?</a>
<a id='line_3706'>    Truly he nothing asked but ‘Follow me.’</a>
<a id='line_3707'></a>
<a id='line_3708'>Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias</a>
<a id='line_3709'>    Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen</a>
<a id='line_3710'>    Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.</a>
<a id='line_3711'></a>
<a id='line_3712'>Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,</a>
<a id='line_3713'>    And keep safe guard o’er the ill-gotten money,</a>
<a id='line_3714'>    Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.</a>
<a id='line_3715'></a>
<a id='line_3716'>And were it not that still forbids it me</a>
<a id='line_3717'>    The reverence for the keys superlative</a>
<a id='line_3718'>    Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,</a>
<a id='line_3719'></a>
<a id='line_3720'>I would make use of words more grievous still;</a>

<a id='line_3733'>    And from the idolater how differ ye,</a>

<a id='line_3736'>Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,</a>
<a id='line_3737'>    Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower</a>
<a id='line_3738'>    Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!”</a>
<a id='line_3739'></a>
<a id='line_3740'>And while I sang to him such notes as these,</a>
<a id='line_3741'>    Either that anger or that conscience stung him,</a>
<a id='line_3742'>    He struggled violently with both his feet.</a>
<a id='line_3743'></a>
<a id='line_3744'>I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,</a>
<a id='line_3745'>    With such contented lip he listened ever</a>
<a id='line_3746'>    Unto the sound of the true words expressed.</a>
<a id='line_3747'></a>
<a id='line_3748'>Therefore with both his arms he took me up,</a>
<a id='line_3749'>    And when he had me all upon his breast,</a>
<a id='line_3750'>    Remounted by the way where he descended.</a>
<a id='line_3751'></a>
<a id='line_3752'>Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him;</a>
<a id='line_3753'>    But bore me to the summit of the arch</a>
<a id='line_3754'>    Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.</a>
<a id='line_3755'></a>
<a id='line_3756'>There tenderly he laid his burden down,</a>
<a id='line_3757'>    Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,</a>
<a id='line_3758'>    That would have been hard passage for the goats:</a>
<a id='line_3759'></a>
<a id='line_3760'>Thence was unveiled to me another valley.</a>

<a id='line_3766'></a>
<a id='line_3767'></a>
<a id='line_3768'>Of a new pain behoves me to make verses</a>
<a id='line_3769'>    And give material to the twentieth canto</a>
<a id='line_3770'>    Of the first song, which is of the submerged.</a>
<a id='line_3771'></a>
<a id='line_3772'>I was already thoroughly disposed</a>
<a id='line_3773'>    To peer down into the uncovered depth,</a>
<a id='line_3774'>    Which bathed itself with tears of agony;</a>
<a id='line_3775'></a>
<a id='line_3776'>And people saw I through the circular valley,</a>
<a id='line_3777'>    Silent and weeping, coming at the pace</a>
<a id='line_3778'>    Which in this world the Litanies assume.</a>
<a id='line_3779'></a>
<a id='line_3780'>As lower down my sight descended on them,</a>
<a id='line_3781'>    Wondrously each one seemed to be distorted</a>
<a id='line_3782'>    From chin to the beginning of the chest;</a>
<a id='line_3783'></a>
<a id='line_3784'>For tow’rds the reins the countenance was turned,</a>
<a id='line_3785'>    And backward it behoved them to advance,</a>
<a id='line_3786'>    As to look forward had been taken from them.</a>
<a id='line_3787'></a>
<a id='line_3788'>Perchance indeed by violence of palsy</a>
<a id='line_3789'>    Some one has been thus wholly turned awry;</a>
<a id='line_3790'>    But I ne’er saw it, nor believe it can be.</a>
<a id='line_3791'></a>
<a id='line_3792'>As God may let thee, Reader, gather fruit</a>
<a id='line_3793'>    From this thy reading, think now for thyself</a>

<a id='line_3795'></a>
<a id='line_3796'>When our own image near me I beheld</a>
<a id='line_3797'>    Distorted so, the weeping of the eyes</a>
<a id='line_3798'>    Along the fissure bathed the hinder parts.</a>
<a id='line_3799'></a>
<a id='line_3800'>Truly I wept, leaning upon a peak</a>
<a id='line_3801'>    Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said</a>
<a id='line_3802'>    To me: “Art thou, too, of the other fools?</a>
<a id='line_3803'></a>
<a id='line_3804'>Here pity lives when it is wholly dead;</a>

<a id='line_3808'>Lift up, lift up thy head, and see for whom</a>
<a id='line_3809'>    Opened the earth before the Thebans’ eyes;</a>
<a id='line_3810'>    Wherefore they all cried: ‘Whither rushest thou,</a>
<a id='line_3811'></a>
<a id='line_3812'>Amphiaraus? Why dost leave the war?’</a>
<a id='line_3813'>    And downward ceased he not to fall amain</a>
<a id='line_3814'>    As far as Minos, who lays hold on all.</a>
<a id='line_3815'></a>
<a id='line_3816'>See, he has made a bosom of his shoulders!</a>
<a id='line_3817'>    Because he wished to see too far before him</a>
<a id='line_3818'>    Behind he looks, and backward goes his way:</a>
<a id='line_3819'></a>
<a id='line_3820'>Behold Tiresias, who his semblance changed,</a>
<a id='line_3821'>    When from a male a female he became,</a>
<a id='line_3822'>    His members being all of them transformed;</a>
<a id='line_3823'></a>
<a id='line_3824'>And afterwards was forced to strike once more</a>
<a id='line_3825'>    The two entangled serpents with his rod,</a>
<a id='line_3826'>    Ere he could have again his manly plumes.</a>
<a id='line_3827'></a>

<a id='line_3830'>    The Carrarese who houses underneath,</a>
<a id='line_3831'></a>
<a id='line_3832'>Among the marbles white a cavern had</a>
<a id='line_3833'>    For his abode; whence to behold the stars</a>
<a id='line_3834'>    And sea, the view was not cut off from him.</a>
<a id='line_3835'></a>
<a id='line_3836'>And she there, who is covering up her breasts,</a>
<a id='line_3837'>    Which thou beholdest not, with loosened tresses,</a>
<a id='line_3838'>    And on that side has all the hairy skin,</a>
<a id='line_3839'></a>
<a id='line_3840'>Was Manto, who made quest through many lands,</a>
<a id='line_3841'>    Afterwards tarried there where I was born;</a>
<a id='line_3842'>    Whereof I would thou list to me a little.</a>
<a id='line_3843'></a>
<a id='line_3844'>After her father had from life departed,</a>
<a id='line_3845'>    And the city of Bacchus had become enslaved,</a>
<a id='line_3846'>    She a long season wandered through the world.</a>
<a id='line_3847'></a>
<a id='line_3848'>Above in beauteous Italy lies a lake</a>
<a id='line_3849'>    At the Alp’s foot that shuts in Germany</a>
<a id='line_3850'>    Over Tyrol, and has the name Benaco.</a>
<a id='line_3851'></a>
<a id='line_3852'>By a thousand springs, I think, and more, is bathed,</a>
<a id='line_3853'>    ’Twixt Garda and Val Camonica, Pennino,</a>
<a id='line_3854'>    With water that grows stagnant in that lake.</a>
<a id='line_3855'></a>
<a id='line_3856'>Midway a place is where the Trentine Pastor,</a>
<a id='line_3857'>    And he of Brescia, and the Veronese</a>
<a id='line_3858'>    Might give his blessing, if he passed that way.</a>
<a id='line_3859'></a>
<a id='line_3860'>Sitteth Peschiera, fortress fair and strong,</a>
<a id='line_3861'>    To front the Brescians and the Bergamasks,</a>
<a id='line_3862'>    Where round about the bank descendeth lowest.</a>
<a id='line_3863'></a>
<a id='line_3864'>There of necessity must fall whatever</a>
<a id='line_3865'>    In bosom of Benaco cannot stay,</a>
<a id='line_3866'>    And grows a river down through verdant pastures.</a>
<a id='line_3867'></a>
<a id='line_3868'>Soon as the water doth begin to run,</a>
<a id='line_3869'>    No more Benaco is it called, but Mincio,</a>
<a id='line_3870'>    Far as Governo, where it falls in Po.</a>
<a id='line_3871'></a>
<a id='line_3872'>Not far it runs before it finds a plain</a>
<a id='line_3873'>    In which it spreads itself, and makes it marshy,</a>
<a id='line_3874'>    And oft ’tis wont in summer to be sickly.</a>
<a id='line_3875'></a>
<a id='line_3876'>Passing that way the virgin pitiless</a>
<a id='line_3877'>    Land in the middle of the fen descried,</a>
<a id='line_3878'>    Untilled and naked of inhabitants;</a>
<a id='line_3879'></a>
<a id='line_3880'>There to escape all human intercourse,</a>
<a id='line_3881'>    She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise</a>
<a id='line_3882'>    And lived, and left her empty body there.</a>
<a id='line_3883'></a>
<a id='line_3884'>The men, thereafter, who were scattered round,</a>
<a id='line_3885'>    Collected in that place, which was made strong</a>
<a id='line_3886'>    By the lagoon it had on every side;</a>
<a id='line_3887'></a>
<a id='line_3888'>They built their city over those dead bones,</a>
<a id='line_3889'>    And, after her who first the place selected,</a>
<a id='line_3890'>    Mantua named it, without other omen.</a>
<a id='line_3891'></a>
<a id='line_3892'>Its people once within more crowded were,</a>
<a id='line_3893'>    Ere the stupidity of Casalodi</a>
<a id='line_3894'>    From Pinamonte had received deceit.</a>
<a id='line_3895'></a>
<a id='line_3896'>Therefore I caution thee, if e’er thou hearest</a>
<a id='line_3897'>    Originate my city otherwise,</a>
<a id='line_3898'>    No falsehood may the verity defraud.”</a>
<a id='line_3899'></a>
<a id='line_3900'>And I: “My Master, thy discourses are</a>
<a id='line_3901'>    To me so certain, and so take my faith,</a>
<a id='line_3902'>    That unto me the rest would be spent coals.</a>
<a id='line_3903'></a>
<a id='line_3904'>But tell me of the people who are passing,</a>
<a id='line_3905'>    If any one note-worthy thou beholdest,</a>
<a id='line_3906'>    For only unto that my mind reverts.”</a>
<a id='line_3907'></a>
<a id='line_3908'>Then said he to me: “He who from the cheek</a>
<a id='line_3909'>    Thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders</a>
<a id='line_3910'>    Was, at the time when Greece was void of males,</a>
<a id='line_3911'></a>
<a id='line_3912'>So that there scarce remained one in the cradle,</a>
<a id='line_3913'>    An augur, and with Calchas gave the moment,</a>
<a id='line_3914'>    In Aulis, when to sever the first cable.</a>

<a id='line_3919'></a>
<a id='line_3920'>The next, who is so slender in the flanks,</a>
<a id='line_3921'>    Was Michael Scott, who of a verity</a>
<a id='line_3922'>    Of magical illusions knew the game.</a>
<a id='line_3923'></a>
<a id='line_3924'>Behold Guido Bonatti, behold Asdente,</a>
<a id='line_3925'>    Who now unto his leather and his thread</a>
<a id='line_3926'>    Would fain have stuck, but he too late repents.</a>
<a id='line_3927'></a>
<a id='line_3928'>Behold the wretched ones, who left the needle,</a>
<a id='line_3929'>    The spool and rock, and made them fortune-tellers;</a>
<a id='line_3930'>    They wrought their magic spells with herb and image.</a>
<a id='line_3931'></a>
<a id='line_3932'>But come now, for already holds the confines</a>
<a id='line_3933'>    Of both the hemispheres, and under Seville</a>
<a id='line_3934'>    Touches the ocean-wave, Cain and the thorns,</a>
<a id='line_3935'></a>
<a id='line_3936'>And yesternight the moon was round already;</a>
<a id='line_3937'>    Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee</a>
<a id='line_3938'>    From time to time within the forest deep.”</a>
<a id='line_3939'></a>
<a id='line_3940'>Thus spake he to me, and we walked the while.</a>

<a id='line_3945'>Inferno: Canto XXI</a>
<a id='line_3946'></a>
<a id='line_3947'></a>
<a id='line_3948'>From bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things</a>
<a id='line_3949'>    Of which my Comedy cares not to sing,</a>
<a id='line_3950'>    We came along, and held the summit, when</a>
<a id='line_3951'></a>
<a id='line_3952'>We halted to behold another fissure</a>
<a id='line_3953'>    Of Malebolge and other vain laments;</a>
<a id='line_3954'>    And I beheld it marvellously dark.</a>
<a id='line_3955'></a>
<a id='line_3956'>As in the Arsenal of the Venetians</a>
<a id='line_3957'>    Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch</a>
<a id='line_3958'>    To smear their unsound vessels o’er again,</a>
<a id='line_3959'></a>
<a id='line_3960'>For sail they cannot; and instead thereof</a>
<a id='line_3961'>    One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks</a>
<a id='line_3962'>    The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;</a>
<a id='line_3963'></a>
<a id='line_3964'>One hammers at the prow, one at the stern,</a>
<a id='line_3965'>    This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,</a>
<a id='line_3966'>    Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;</a>
<a id='line_3967'></a>
<a id='line_3968'>Thus, not by fire, but by the art divine,</a>
<a id='line_3969'>    Was boiling down below there a dense pitch</a>
<a id='line_3970'>    Which upon every side the bank belimed.</a>
<a id='line_3971'></a>
<a id='line_3972'>I saw it, but I did not see within it</a>
<a id='line_3973'>    Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,</a>
<a id='line_3974'>    And all swell up and resubside compressed.</a>
<a id='line_3975'></a>
<a id='line_3976'>The while below there fixedly I gazed,</a>
<a id='line_3977'>    My Leader, crying out: “Beware, beware!”</a>
<a id='line_3978'>    Drew me unto himself from where I stood.</a>
<a id='line_3979'></a>
<a id='line_3980'>Then I turned round, as one who is impatient</a>
<a id='line_3981'>    To see what it behoves him to escape,</a>
<a id='line_3982'>    And whom a sudden terror doth unman,</a>
<a id='line_3983'></a>
<a id='line_3984'>Who, while he looks, delays not his departure;</a>
<a id='line_3985'>    And I beheld behind us a black devil,</a>
<a id='line_3986'>    Running along upon the crag, approach.</a>
<a id='line_3987'></a>
<a id='line_3988'>Ah, how ferocious was he in his aspect!</a>
<a id='line_3989'>    And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,</a>
<a id='line_3990'>    With open wings and light upon his feet!</a>
<a id='line_3991'></a>
<a id='line_3992'>His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,</a>
<a id='line_3993'>    A sinner did encumber with both haunches,</a>
<a id='line_3994'>    And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.</a>
<a id='line_3995'></a>
<a id='line_3996'>From off our bridge, he said: “O Malebranche,</a>
<a id='line_3997'>    Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;</a>
<a id='line_3998'>    Plunge him beneath, for I return for others</a>
<a id='line_3999'></a>
<a id='line_4000'>Unto that town, which is well furnished with them.</a>
<a id='line_4001'>    All there are barrators, except Bonturo;</a>
<a id='line_4002'>    No into Yes for money there is changed.”</a>
<a id='line_4003'></a>
<a id='line_4004'>He hurled him down, and over the hard crag</a>
<a id='line_4005'>    Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened</a>
<a id='line_4006'>    In so much hurry to pursue a thief.</a>
<a id='line_4007'></a>
<a id='line_4008'>The other sank, and rose again face downward;</a>
<a id='line_4009'>    But the demons, under cover of the bridge,</a>
<a id='line_4010'>    Cried: “Here the Santo Volto has no place!</a>
<a id='line_4011'></a>
<a id='line_4012'>Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;</a>
<a id='line_4013'>    Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,</a>
<a id='line_4014'>    Do not uplift thyself above the pitch.”</a>
<a id='line_4015'></a>
<a id='line_4016'>They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;</a>
<a id='line_4017'>    They said: “It here behoves thee to dance covered,</a>
<a id='line_4018'>    That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer.”</a>
<a id='line_4019'></a>
<a id='line_4020'>Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make</a>
<a id='line_4021'>    Immerse into the middle of the caldron</a>
<a id='line_4022'>    The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.</a>
<a id='line_4023'></a>
<a id='line_4024'>Said the good Master to me: “That it be not</a>
<a id='line_4025'>    Apparent thou art here, crouch thyself down</a>
<a id='line_4026'>    Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen;</a>
<a id='line_4027'></a>
<a id='line_4028'>And for no outrage that is done to me</a>
<a id='line_4029'>    Be thou afraid, because these things I know,</a>
<a id='line_4030'>    For once before was I in such a scuffle.”</a>
<a id='line_4031'></a>
<a id='line_4032'>Then he passed on beyond the bridge’s head,</a>
<a id='line_4033'>    And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,</a>
<a id='line_4034'>    Need was for him to have a steadfast front.</a>
<a id='line_4035'></a>
<a id='line_4036'>With the same fury, and the same uproar,</a>
<a id='line_4037'>    As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,</a>
<a id='line_4038'>    Who on a sudden begs, where’er he stops,</a>
<a id='line_4039'></a>
<a id='line_4040'>They issued from beneath the little bridge,</a>
<a id='line_4041'>    And turned against him all their grappling-irons;</a>
<a id='line_4042'>    But he cried out: “Be none of you malignant!</a>
<a id='line_4043'></a>
<a id='line_4044'>Before those hooks of yours lay hold of me,</a>
<a id='line_4045'>    Let one of you step forward, who may hear me,</a>
<a id='line_4046'>    And then take counsel as to grappling me.”</a>
<a id='line_4047'></a>
<a id='line_4048'>They all cried out: “Let Malacoda go;”</a>
<a id='line_4049'>    Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,</a>
<a id='line_4050'>    And he came to him, saying: “What avails it?”</a>
<a id='line_4051'></a>
<a id='line_4052'>“Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me</a>
<a id='line_4053'>    Advanced into this place,” my Master said,</a>
<a id='line_4054'>    “Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence,</a>
<a id='line_4055'></a>
<a id='line_4056'>Without the will divine, and fate auspicious?</a>
<a id='line_4057'>    Let me go on, for it in Heaven is willed</a>
<a id='line_4058'>    That I another show this savage road.”</a>
<a id='line_4059'></a>
<a id='line_4060'>Then was his arrogance so humbled in him,</a>
<a id='line_4061'>    That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,</a>
<a id='line_4062'>    And to the others said: “Now strike him not.”</a>
<a id='line_4063'></a>
<a id='line_4064'>And unto me my Guide: “O thou, who sittest</a>
<a id='line_4065'>    Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,</a>
<a id='line_4066'>    Securely now return to me again.”</a>
<a id='line_4067'></a>
<a id='line_4068'>Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him;</a>
<a id='line_4069'>    And all the devils forward thrust themselves,</a>
<a id='line_4070'>    So that I feared they would not keep their compact.</a>
<a id='line_4071'></a>
<a id='line_4072'>And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers</a>
<a id='line_4073'>    Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,</a>
<a id='line_4074'>    Seeing themselves among so many foes.</a>
<a id='line_4075'></a>
<a id='line_4076'>Close did I press myself with all my person</a>
<a id='line_4077'>    Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes</a>
<a id='line_4078'>    From off their countenance, which was not good.</a>
<a id='line_4079'></a>
<a id='line_4080'>They lowered their rakes, and “Wilt thou have me hit him,”</a>
<a id='line_4081'>    They said to one another, “on the rump?”</a>
<a id='line_4082'>    And answered: “Yes; see that thou nick him with it.”</a>
<a id='line_4083'></a>
<a id='line_4084'>But the same demon who was holding parley</a>
<a id='line_4085'>    With my Conductor turned him very quickly,</a>
<a id='line_4086'>    And said: “Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;”</a>
<a id='line_4087'></a>
<a id='line_4088'>Then said to us: “You can no farther go</a>
<a id='line_4089'>    Forward upon this crag, because is lying</a>
<a id='line_4090'>    All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.</a>
<a id='line_4091'></a>
<a id='line_4092'>And if it still doth please you to go onward,</a>
<a id='line_4093'>    Pursue your way along upon this rock;</a>
<a id='line_4094'>    Near is another crag that yields a path.</a>
<a id='line_4095'></a>
<a id='line_4096'>Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,</a>
<a id='line_4097'>    One thousand and two hundred sixty-six</a>
<a id='line_4098'>    Years were complete, that here the way was broken.</a>
<a id='line_4099'></a>
<a id='line_4100'>I send in that direction some of mine</a>
<a id='line_4101'>    To see if any one doth air himself;</a>
<a id='line_4102'>    Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.</a>
<a id='line_4103'></a>
<a id='line_4104'>Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,”</a>
<a id='line_4105'>    Began he to cry out, “and thou, Cagnazzo;</a>
<a id='line_4106'>    And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.</a>
<a id='line_4107'></a>
<a id='line_4108'>Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,</a>
<a id='line_4109'>    And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,</a>
<a id='line_4110'>    And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;</a>
<a id='line_4111'></a>
<a id='line_4112'>Search ye all round about the boiling pitch;</a>
<a id='line_4113'>    Let these be safe as far as the next crag,</a>
<a id='line_4114'>    That all unbroken passes o’er the dens.”</a>
<a id='line_4115'></a>
<a id='line_4116'>“O me! what is it, Master, that I see?</a>
<a id='line_4117'>    Pray let us go,” I said, “without an escort,</a>
<a id='line_4118'>    If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.</a>
<a id='line_4119'></a>
<a id='line_4120'>If thou art as observant as thy wont is,</a>
<a id='line_4121'>    Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,</a>
<a id='line_4122'>    And with their brows are threatening woe to us?”</a>
<a id='line_4123'></a>
<a id='line_4124'>And he to me: “I will not have thee fear;</a>
<a id='line_4125'>    Let them gnash on, according to their fancy,</a>
<a id='line_4126'>    Because they do it for those boiling wretches.”</a>
<a id='line_4127'></a>
<a id='line_4128'>Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about;</a>
<a id='line_4129'>    But first had each one thrust his tongue between</a>
<a id='line_4130'>    His teeth towards their leader for a signal;</a>
<a id='line_4131'></a>
<a id='line_4132'>And he had made a trumpet of his rump.</a>
<a id='line_4133'></a>
<a id='line_4134'></a>
<a id='line_4135'></a>
<a id='line_4136'></a>
<a id='line_4137'>Inferno: Canto XXII</a>
<a id='line_4138'></a>
<a id='line_4139'></a>
<a id='line_4140'>I have erewhile seen horsemen moving camp,</a>
<a id='line_4141'>    Begin the storming, and their muster make,</a>
<a id='line_4142'>    And sometimes starting off for their escape;</a>
<a id='line_4143'></a>
<a id='line_4144'>Vaunt-couriers have I seen upon your land,</a>
<a id='line_4145'>    O Aretines, and foragers go forth,</a>
<a id='line_4146'>    Tournaments stricken, and the joustings run,</a>
<a id='line_4147'></a>
<a id='line_4148'>Sometimes with trumpets and sometimes with bells,</a>
<a id='line_4149'>    With kettle-drums, and signals of the castles,</a>
<a id='line_4150'>    And with our own, and with outlandish things,</a>
<a id='line_4151'></a>
<a id='line_4152'>But never yet with bagpipe so uncouth</a>
<a id='line_4153'>    Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry,</a>
<a id='line_4154'>    Nor ship by any sign of land or star.</a>
<a id='line_4155'></a>
<a id='line_4156'>We went upon our way with the ten demons;</a>
<a id='line_4157'>    Ah, savage company! but in the church</a>
<a id='line_4158'>    With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons!</a>
<a id='line_4159'></a>
<a id='line_4160'>Ever upon the pitch was my intent,</a>
<a id='line_4161'>    To see the whole condition of that Bolgia,</a>
<a id='line_4162'>    And of the people who therein were burned.</a>
<a id='line_4163'></a>
<a id='line_4164'>Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign</a>
<a id='line_4165'>    To mariners by arching of the back,</a>
<a id='line_4166'>    That they should counsel take to save their vessel,</a>
<a id='line_4167'></a>
<a id='line_4168'>Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain,</a>
<a id='line_4169'>    One of the sinners would display his back,</a>
<a id='line_4170'>    And in less time conceal it than it lightens.</a>
<a id='line_4171'></a>
<a id='line_4172'>As on the brink of water in a ditch</a>
<a id='line_4173'>    The frogs stand only with their muzzles out,</a>
<a id='line_4174'>    So that they hide their feet and other bulk,</a>
<a id='line_4175'></a>
<a id='line_4176'>So upon every side the sinners stood;</a>
<a id='line_4177'>    But ever as Barbariccia near them came,</a>
<a id='line_4178'>    Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew.</a>
<a id='line_4179'></a>
<a id='line_4180'>I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,</a>
<a id='line_4181'>    One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass</a>
<a id='line_4182'>    One frog remains, and down another dives;</a>
<a id='line_4183'></a>
<a id='line_4184'>And Graffiacan, who most confronted him,</a>
<a id='line_4185'>    Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch,</a>
<a id='line_4186'>    And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.</a>
<a id='line_4187'></a>
<a id='line_4188'>I knew, before, the names of all of them,</a>
<a id='line_4189'>    So had I noted them when they were chosen,</a>
<a id='line_4190'>    And when they called each other, listened how.</a>
<a id='line_4191'></a>
<a id='line_4192'>“O Rubicante, see that thou do lay</a>
<a id='line_4193'>    Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,”</a>
<a id='line_4194'>    Cried all together the accursed ones.</a>
<a id='line_4195'></a>
<a id='line_4196'>And I: “My Master, see to it, if thou canst,</a>
<a id='line_4197'>    That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,</a>
<a id='line_4198'>    Thus come into his adversaries’ hands.”</a>
<a id='line_4199'></a>
<a id='line_4200'>Near to the side of him my Leader drew,</a>
<a id='line_4201'>    Asked of him whence he was; and he replied:</a>
<a id='line_4202'>    “I in the kingdom of Navarre was born;</a>
<a id='line_4203'></a>
<a id='line_4204'>My mother placed me servant to a lord,</a>
<a id='line_4205'>    For she had borne me to a ribald knave,</a>
<a id='line_4206'>    Destroyer of himself and of his things.</a>
<a id='line_4207'></a>
<a id='line_4208'>Then I domestic was of good King Thibault;</a>
<a id='line_4209'>    I set me there to practise barratry,</a>
<a id='line_4210'>    For which I pay the reckoning in this heat.”</a>
<a id='line_4211'></a>
<a id='line_4212'>And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected,</a>
<a id='line_4213'>    On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,</a>
<a id='line_4214'>    Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.</a>
<a id='line_4215'></a>
<a id='line_4216'>Among malicious cats the mouse had come;</a>
<a id='line_4217'>    But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,</a>
<a id='line_4218'>    And said: “Stand ye aside, while I enfork him.”</a>
<a id='line_4219'></a>
<a id='line_4220'>And to my Master he turned round his head;</a>
<a id='line_4221'>    “Ask him again,” he said, “if more thou wish</a>
<a id='line_4222'>    To know from him, before some one destroy him.”</a>
<a id='line_4223'></a>
<a id='line_4224'>The Guide: “Now tell then of the other culprits;</a>
<a id='line_4225'>    Knowest thou any one who is a Latian,</a>
<a id='line_4226'>    Under the pitch?” And he: “I separated</a>
<a id='line_4227'></a>
<a id='line_4228'>Lately from one who was a neighbour to it;</a>
<a id='line_4229'>    Would that I still were covered up with him,</a>
<a id='line_4230'>    For I should fear not either claw nor hook!”</a>
<a id='line_4231'></a>
<a id='line_4232'>And Libicocco: “We have borne too much;”</a>
<a id='line_4233'>    And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,</a>
<a id='line_4234'>    So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon.</a>
<a id='line_4235'></a>
<a id='line_4236'>Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him</a>
<a id='line_4237'>    Down at the legs; whence their Decurion</a>
<a id='line_4238'>    Turned round and round about with evil look.</a>
<a id='line_4239'></a>
<a id='line_4240'>When they again somewhat were pacified,</a>
<a id='line_4241'>    Of him, who still was looking at his wound,</a>
<a id='line_4242'>    Demanded my Conductor without stay:</a>
<a id='line_4243'></a>
<a id='line_4244'>“Who was that one, from whom a luckless parting</a>
<a id='line_4245'>    Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?”</a>
<a id='line_4246'>    And he replied: “It was the Friar Gomita,</a>
<a id='line_4247'></a>
<a id='line_4248'>He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,</a>
<a id='line_4249'>    Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,</a>
<a id='line_4250'>    And dealt so with them each exults thereat;</a>
<a id='line_4251'></a>
<a id='line_4252'>Money he took, and let them smoothly off,</a>
<a id='line_4253'>    As he says; and in other offices</a>
<a id='line_4254'>    A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.</a>
<a id='line_4255'></a>
<a id='line_4256'>Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche</a>
<a id='line_4257'>    Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia</a>
<a id='line_4258'>    To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.</a>
<a id='line_4259'></a>
<a id='line_4260'>O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;</a>
<a id='line_4261'>    Still farther would I speak, but am afraid</a>
<a id='line_4262'>    Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready.”</a>
<a id='line_4263'></a>
<a id='line_4264'>And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,</a>
<a id='line_4265'>    Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,</a>
<a id='line_4266'>    Said: “Stand aside there, thou malicious bird.”</a>
<a id='line_4267'></a>
<a id='line_4268'>“If you desire either to see or hear,”</a>
<a id='line_4269'>    The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,</a>
<a id='line_4270'>    “Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.</a>
<a id='line_4271'></a>
<a id='line_4272'>But let the Malebranche cease a little,</a>
<a id='line_4273'>    So that these may not their revenges fear,</a>
<a id='line_4274'>    And I, down sitting in this very place,</a>
<a id='line_4275'></a>
<a id='line_4276'>For one that I am will make seven come,</a>
<a id='line_4277'>    When I shall whistle, as our custom is</a>
<a id='line_4278'>    To do whenever one of us comes out.”</a>
<a id='line_4279'></a>
<a id='line_4280'>Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,</a>
<a id='line_4281'>    Shaking his head, and said: “Just hear the trick</a>
<a id='line_4282'>    Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!”</a>
<a id='line_4283'></a>
<a id='line_4284'>Whence he, who snares in great abundance had,</a>
<a id='line_4285'>    Responded: “I by far too cunning am,</a>
<a id='line_4286'>    When I procure for mine a greater sadness.”</a>
<a id='line_4287'></a>
<a id='line_4288'>Alichin held not in, but running counter</a>
<a id='line_4289'>    Unto the rest, said to him: “If thou dive,</a>
<a id='line_4290'>    I will not follow thee upon the gallop,</a>
<a id='line_4291'></a>
<a id='line_4292'>But I will beat my wings above the pitch;</a>
<a id='line_4293'>    The height be left, and be the bank a shield</a>
<a id='line_4294'>    To see if thou alone dost countervail us.”</a>
<a id='line_4295'></a>
<a id='line_4296'>O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!</a>
<a id='line_4297'>    Each to the other side his eyes averted;</a>
<a id='line_4298'>    He first, who most reluctant was to do it.</a>
<a id='line_4299'></a>
<a id='line_4300'>The Navarrese selected well his time;</a>
<a id='line_4301'>    Planted his feet on land, and in a moment</a>
<a id='line_4302'>    Leaped, and released himself from their design.</a>
<a id='line_4303'></a>
<a id='line_4304'>Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,</a>
<a id='line_4305'>    But he most who was cause of the defeat;</a>
<a id='line_4306'>    Therefore he moved, and cried: “Thou art o’ertakern.”</a>
<a id='line_4307'></a>
<a id='line_4308'>But little it availed, for wings could not</a>
<a id='line_4309'>    Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,</a>
<a id='line_4310'>    And, flying, upward he his breast directed;</a>
<a id='line_4311'></a>
<a id='line_4312'>Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden</a>
<a id='line_4313'>    Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,</a>
<a id='line_4314'>    And upward he returneth cross and weary.</a>
<a id='line_4315'></a>
<a id='line_4316'>Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina</a>
<a id='line_4317'>    Flying behind him followed close, desirous</a>
<a id='line_4318'>    The other should escape, to have a quarrel.</a>
<a id='line_4319'></a>
<a id='line_4320'>And when the barrator had disappeared,</a>
<a id='line_4321'>    He turned his talons upon his companion,</a>
<a id='line_4322'>    And grappled with him right above the moat.</a>
<a id='line_4323'></a>
<a id='line_4324'>But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk</a>
<a id='line_4325'>    To clapperclaw him well; and both of them</a>
<a id='line_4326'>    Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.</a>
<a id='line_4327'></a>
<a id='line_4328'>A sudden intercessor was the heat;</a>
<a id='line_4329'>    But ne’ertheless of rising there was naught,</a>
<a id='line_4330'>    To such degree they had their wings belimed.</a>
<a id='line_4331'></a>
<a id='line_4332'>Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia</a>
<a id='line_4333'>    Made four of them fly to the other side</a>
<a id='line_4334'>    With all their gaffs, and very speedily</a>
<a id='line_4335'></a>
<a id='line_4336'>This side and that they to their posts descended;</a>
<a id='line_4337'>    They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,</a>
<a id='line_4338'>    Who were already baked within the crust,</a>
<a id='line_4339'></a>
<a id='line_4340'>And in this manner busied did we leave them.</a>
<a id='line_4341'></a>
<a id='line_4342'></a>
<a id='line_4343'></a>
<a id='line_4344'></a>
<a id='line_4345'>Inferno: Canto XXIII</a>
<a id='line_4346'></a>
<a id='line_4347'></a>
<a id='line_4348'>Silent, alone, and without company</a>
<a id='line_4349'>    We went, the one in front, the other after,</a>
<a id='line_4350'>    As go the Minor Friars along their way.</a>
<a id='line_4351'></a>
<a id='line_4352'>Upon the fable of Aesop was directed</a>
<a id='line_4353'>    My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,</a>
<a id='line_4354'>    Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;</a>
<a id='line_4355'></a>
<a id='line_4356'>For ‘mo’ and ‘issa’ are not more alike</a>
<a id='line_4357'>    Than this one is to that, if well we couple</a>
<a id='line_4358'>    End and beginning with a steadfast mind.</a>
<a id='line_4359'></a>
<a id='line_4360'>And even as one thought from another springs,</a>
<a id='line_4361'>    So afterward from that was born another,</a>
<a id='line_4362'>    Which the first fear within me double made.</a>
<a id='line_4363'></a>
<a id='line_4364'>Thus did I ponder: “These on our account</a>
<a id='line_4365'>    Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff</a>
<a id='line_4366'>    So great, that much I think it must annoy them.</a>
<a id='line_4367'></a>
<a id='line_4368'>If anger be engrafted on ill-will,</a>
<a id='line_4369'>    They will come after us more merciless</a>
<a id='line_4370'>    Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,”</a>
<a id='line_4371'></a>
<a id='line_4372'>I felt my hair stand all on end already</a>
<a id='line_4373'>    With terror, and stood backwardly intent,</a>
<a id='line_4374'>    When said I: “Master, if thou hidest not</a>
<a id='line_4375'></a>
<a id='line_4376'>Thyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche</a>
<a id='line_4377'>    I am in dread; we have them now behind us;</a>
<a id='line_4378'>    I so imagine them, I already feel them.”</a>
<a id='line_4379'></a>
<a id='line_4380'>And he: “If I were made of leaded glass,</a>
<a id='line_4381'>    Thine outward image I should not attract</a>
<a id='line_4382'>    Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.</a>
<a id='line_4383'></a>
<a id='line_4384'>Just now thy thoughts came in among my own,</a>
<a id='line_4385'>    With similar attitude and similar face,</a>
<a id='line_4386'>    So that of both one counsel sole I made.</a>
<a id='line_4387'></a>
<a id='line_4388'>If peradventure the right bank so slope</a>
<a id='line_4389'>    That we to the next Bolgia can descend,</a>
<a id='line_4390'>    We shall escape from the imagined chase.”</a>
<a id='line_4391'></a>
<a id='line_4392'>Not yet he finished rendering such opinion,</a>
<a id='line_4393'>    When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,</a>
<a id='line_4394'>    Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.</a>
<a id='line_4395'></a>
<a id='line_4396'>My Leader on a sudden seized me up,</a>
<a id='line_4397'>    Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,</a>
<a id='line_4398'>    And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,</a>
<a id='line_4399'></a>
<a id='line_4400'>Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,</a>
<a id='line_4401'>    Having more care of him than of herself,</a>
<a id='line_4402'>    So that she clothes her only with a shift;</a>
<a id='line_4403'></a>
<a id='line_4404'>And downward from the top of the hard bank</a>
<a id='line_4405'>    Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,</a>
<a id='line_4406'>    That one side of the other Bolgia walls.</a>
<a id='line_4407'></a>
<a id='line_4408'>Ne’er ran so swiftly water through a sluice</a>
<a id='line_4409'>    To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,</a>
<a id='line_4410'>    When nearest to the paddles it approaches,</a>
<a id='line_4411'></a>
<a id='line_4412'>As did my Master down along that border,</a>
<a id='line_4413'>    Bearing me with him on his breast away,</a>
<a id='line_4414'>    As his own son, and not as a companion.</a>
<a id='line_4415'></a>
<a id='line_4416'>Hardly the bed of the ravine below</a>
<a id='line_4417'>    His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill</a>
<a id='line_4418'>    Right over us; but he was not afraid;</a>
<a id='line_4419'></a>
<a id='line_4420'>For the high Providence, which had ordained</a>
<a id='line_4421'>    To place them ministers of the fifth moat,</a>
<a id='line_4422'>    The power of thence departing took from all.</a>
<a id='line_4423'></a>
<a id='line_4424'>A painted people there below we found,</a>
<a id='line_4425'>    Who went about with footsteps very slow,</a>
<a id='line_4426'>    Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.</a>
<a id='line_4427'></a>
<a id='line_4428'>They had on mantles with the hoods low down</a>
<a id='line_4429'>    Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut</a>
<a id='line_4430'>    That in Cologne they for the monks are made.</a>
<a id='line_4431'></a>
<a id='line_4432'>Without, they gilded are so that it dazzles;</a>
<a id='line_4433'>    But inwardly all leaden and so heavy</a>
<a id='line_4434'>    That Frederick used to put them on of straw.</a>
<a id='line_4435'></a>
<a id='line_4436'>O everlastingly fatiguing mantle!</a>
<a id='line_4437'>    Again we turned us, still to the left hand</a>
<a id='line_4438'>    Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;</a>
<a id='line_4439'></a>
<a id='line_4440'>But owing to the weight, that weary folk</a>
<a id='line_4441'>    Came on so tardily, that we were new</a>
<a id='line_4442'>    In company at each motion of the haunch.</a>
<a id='line_4443'></a>
<a id='line_4444'>Whence I unto my Leader: “See thou find</a>
<a id='line_4445'>    Some one who may by deed or name be known,</a>
<a id='line_4446'>    And thus in going move thine eye about.”</a>
<a id='line_4447'></a>
<a id='line_4448'>And one, who understood the Tuscan speech,</a>
<a id='line_4449'>    Cried to us from behind: “Stay ye your feet,</a>
<a id='line_4450'>    Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!</a>
<a id='line_4451'></a>
<a id='line_4452'>Perhaps thou’lt have from me what thou demandest.”</a>
<a id='line_4453'>    Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: “Wait,</a>
<a id='line_4454'>    And then according to his pace proceed.”</a>
<a id='line_4455'></a>
<a id='line_4456'>I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste</a>
<a id='line_4457'>    Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;</a>
<a id='line_4458'>    But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.</a>
<a id='line_4459'></a>
<a id='line_4460'>When they came up, long with an eye askance</a>
<a id='line_4461'>    They scanned me without uttering a word.</a>
<a id='line_4462'>    Then to each other turned, and said together:</a>
<a id='line_4463'></a>
<a id='line_4464'>“He by the action of his throat seems living;</a>
<a id='line_4465'>    And if they dead are, by what privilege</a>
<a id='line_4466'>    Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?”</a>
<a id='line_4467'></a>
<a id='line_4468'>Then said to me: “Tuscan, who to the college</a>
<a id='line_4469'>    Of miserable hypocrites art come,</a>
<a id='line_4470'>    Do not disdain to tell us who thou art.”</a>
<a id='line_4471'></a>
<a id='line_4472'>And I to them: “Born was I, and grew up</a>
<a id='line_4473'>    In the great town on the fair river of Arno,</a>
<a id='line_4474'>    And with the body am I’ve always had.</a>
<a id='line_4475'></a>
<a id='line_4476'>But who are ye, in whom there trickles down</a>
<a id='line_4477'>    Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?</a>
<a id='line_4478'>    And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?”</a>
<a id='line_4479'></a>
<a id='line_4480'>And one replied to me: “These orange cloaks</a>
<a id='line_4481'>    Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights</a>
<a id='line_4482'>    Cause in this way their balances to creak.</a>
<a id='line_4483'></a>
<a id='line_4484'>Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;</a>
<a id='line_4485'>    I Catalano, and he Loderingo</a>
<a id='line_4486'>    Named, and together taken by thy city,</a>
<a id='line_4487'></a>
<a id='line_4488'>As the wont is to take one man alone,</a>
<a id='line_4489'>    For maintenance of its peace; and we were such</a>
<a id='line_4490'>    That still it is apparent round Gardingo.”</a>
<a id='line_4491'></a>
<a id='line_4492'>“O Friars,” began I, “your iniquitous. . .”</a>
<a id='line_4493'>    But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed</a>
<a id='line_4494'>    One crucified with three stakes on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_4495'></a>
<a id='line_4496'>When me he saw, he writhed himself all over,</a>
<a id='line_4497'>    Blowing into his beard with suspirations;</a>
<a id='line_4498'>    And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,</a>
<a id='line_4499'></a>
<a id='line_4500'>Said to me: “This transfixed one, whom thou seest,</a>
<a id='line_4501'>    Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet</a>
<a id='line_4502'>    To put one man to torture for the people.</a>
<a id='line_4503'></a>
<a id='line_4504'>Crosswise and naked is he on the path,</a>
<a id='line_4505'>    As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,</a>
<a id='line_4506'>    Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;</a>
<a id='line_4507'></a>
<a id='line_4508'>And in like mode his father-in-law is punished</a>
<a id='line_4509'>    Within this moat, and the others of the council,</a>
<a id='line_4510'>    Which for the Jews was a malignant seed.”</a>
<a id='line_4511'></a>
<a id='line_4512'>And thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel</a>
<a id='line_4513'>    O’er him who was extended on the cross</a>
<a id='line_4514'>    So vilely in eternal banishment.</a>
<a id='line_4515'></a>
<a id='line_4516'>Then he directed to the Friar this voice:</a>
<a id='line_4517'>    “Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us</a>
<a id='line_4518'>    If to the right hand any pass slope down</a>
<a id='line_4519'></a>
<a id='line_4520'>By which we two may issue forth from here,</a>
<a id='line_4521'>    Without constraining some of the black angels</a>
<a id='line_4522'>    To come and extricate us from this deep.”</a>
<a id='line_4523'></a>
<a id='line_4524'>Then he made answer: “Nearer than thou hopest</a>
<a id='line_4525'>    There is a rock, that forth from the great circle</a>
<a id='line_4526'>    Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,</a>
<a id='line_4527'></a>
<a id='line_4528'>Save that at this ’tis broken, and does not bridge it;</a>
<a id='line_4529'>    You will be able to mount up the ruin,</a>
<a id='line_4530'>    That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises.”</a>
<a id='line_4531'></a>
<a id='line_4532'>The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down;</a>
<a id='line_4533'>    Then said: “The business badly he recounted</a>
<a id='line_4534'>    Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder.”</a>
<a id='line_4535'></a>
<a id='line_4536'>And the Friar: “Many of the Devil’s vices</a>
<a id='line_4537'>    Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,</a>
<a id='line_4538'>    That he’s a liar and the father of lies.”</a>
<a id='line_4539'></a>
<a id='line_4540'>Thereat my Leader with great strides went on,</a>
<a id='line_4541'>    Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;</a>
<a id='line_4542'>    Whence from the heavy-laden I departed</a>
<a id='line_4543'></a>
<a id='line_4544'>After the prints of his beloved feet.</a>
<a id='line_4545'></a>
<a id='line_4546'></a>
<a id='line_4547'></a>
<a id='line_4548'></a>
<a id='line_4549'>Inferno: Canto XXIV</a>
<a id='line_4550'></a>
<a id='line_4551'></a>
<a id='line_4552'>In that part of the youthful year wherein</a>
<a id='line_4553'>    The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,</a>
<a id='line_4554'>    And now the nights draw near to half the day,</a>
<a id='line_4555'></a>
<a id='line_4556'>What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground</a>
<a id='line_4557'>    The outward semblance of her sister white,</a>
<a id='line_4558'>    But little lasts the temper of her pen,</a>
<a id='line_4559'></a>
<a id='line_4560'>The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,</a>
<a id='line_4561'>    Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign</a>
<a id='line_4562'>    All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,</a>
<a id='line_4563'></a>
<a id='line_4564'>Returns in doors, and up and down laments,</a>
<a id='line_4565'>    Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;</a>
<a id='line_4566'>    Then he returns and hope revives again,</a>
<a id='line_4567'></a>
<a id='line_4568'>Seeing the world has changed its countenance</a>
<a id='line_4569'>    In little time, and takes his shepherd’s crook,</a>
<a id='line_4570'>    And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.</a>
<a id='line_4571'></a>
<a id='line_4572'>Thus did the Master fill me with alarm,</a>
<a id='line_4573'>    When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,</a>
<a id='line_4574'>    And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.</a>
<a id='line_4575'></a>
<a id='line_4576'>For as we came unto the ruined bridge,</a>
<a id='line_4577'>    The Leader turned to me with that sweet look</a>
<a id='line_4578'>    Which at the mountain’s foot I first beheld.</a>
<a id='line_4579'></a>
<a id='line_4580'>His arms he opened, after some advisement</a>
<a id='line_4581'>    Within himself elected, looking first</a>
<a id='line_4582'>    Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.</a>
<a id='line_4583'></a>
<a id='line_4584'>And even as he who acts and meditates,</a>
<a id='line_4585'>    For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,</a>
<a id='line_4586'>    So upward lifting me towards the summit</a>
<a id='line_4587'></a>
<a id='line_4588'>Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag,</a>
<a id='line_4589'>    Saying: “To that one grapple afterwards,</a>
<a id='line_4590'>    But try first if ’tis such that it will hold thee.”</a>
<a id='line_4591'></a>
<a id='line_4592'>This was no way for one clothed with a cloak;</a>
<a id='line_4593'>    For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,</a>
<a id='line_4594'>    Were able to ascend from jag to jag.</a>
<a id='line_4595'></a>
<a id='line_4596'>And had it not been, that upon that precinct</a>
<a id='line_4597'>    Shorter was the ascent than on the other,</a>
<a id='line_4598'>    He I know not, but I had been dead beat.</a>
<a id='line_4599'></a>
<a id='line_4600'>But because Malebolge tow’rds the mouth</a>
<a id='line_4601'>    Of the profoundest well is all inclining,</a>
<a id='line_4602'>    The structure of each valley doth import</a>
<a id='line_4603'></a>
<a id='line_4604'>That one bank rises and the other sinks.</a>
<a id='line_4605'>    Still we arrived at length upon the point</a>
<a id='line_4606'>    Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.</a>
<a id='line_4607'></a>
<a id='line_4608'>The breath was from my lungs so milked away,</a>
<a id='line_4609'>    When I was up, that I could go no farther,</a>
<a id='line_4610'>    Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.</a>
<a id='line_4611'></a>
<a id='line_4612'>“Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,”</a>
<a id='line_4613'>    My Master said; “for sitting upon down,</a>
<a id='line_4614'>    Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,</a>
<a id='line_4615'></a>
<a id='line_4616'>Withouten which whoso his life consumes</a>
<a id='line_4617'>    Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth,</a>
<a id='line_4618'>    As smoke in air or in the water foam.</a>
<a id='line_4619'></a>
<a id='line_4620'>And therefore raise thee up, o’ercome the anguish</a>
<a id='line_4621'>    With spirit that o’ercometh every battle,</a>
<a id='line_4622'>    If with its heavy body it sink not.</a>
<a id='line_4623'></a>
<a id='line_4624'>A longer stairway it behoves thee mount;</a>
<a id='line_4625'>    ’Tis not enough from these to have departed;</a>
<a id='line_4626'>    Let it avail thee, if thou understand me.”</a>
<a id='line_4627'></a>
<a id='line_4628'>Then I uprose, showing myself provided</a>
<a id='line_4629'>    Better with breath than I did feel myself,</a>
<a id='line_4630'>    And said: “Go on, for I am strong and bold.”</a>
<a id='line_4631'></a>
<a id='line_4632'>Upward we took our way along the crag,</a>
<a id='line_4633'>    Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,</a>
<a id='line_4634'>    And more precipitous far than that before.</a>
<a id='line_4635'></a>
<a id='line_4636'>Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted;</a>
<a id='line_4637'>    Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,</a>
<a id='line_4638'>    Not well adapted to articulate words.</a>
<a id='line_4639'></a>
<a id='line_4640'>I know not what it said, though o’er the back</a>
<a id='line_4641'>    I now was of the arch that passes there;</a>
<a id='line_4642'>    But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.</a>
<a id='line_4643'></a>
<a id='line_4644'>I was bent downward, but my living eyes</a>
<a id='line_4645'>    Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;</a>
<a id='line_4646'>    Wherefore I: “Master, see that thou arrive</a>
<a id='line_4647'></a>
<a id='line_4648'>At the next round, and let us descend the wall;</a>
<a id='line_4649'>    For as from hence I hear and understand not,</a>
<a id='line_4650'>    So I look down and nothing I distinguish.”</a>
<a id='line_4651'></a>
<a id='line_4652'>“Other response,” he said, “I make thee not,</a>
<a id='line_4653'>    Except the doing; for the modest asking</a>
<a id='line_4654'>    Ought to be followed by the deed in silence.”</a>
<a id='line_4655'></a>
<a id='line_4656'>We from the bridge descended at its head,</a>
<a id='line_4657'>    Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,</a>
<a id='line_4658'>    And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;</a>
<a id='line_4659'></a>
<a id='line_4660'>And I beheld therein a terrible throng</a>
<a id='line_4661'>    Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind,</a>
<a id='line_4662'>    That the remembrance still congeals my blood</a>
<a id='line_4663'></a>
<a id='line_4664'>Let Libya boast no longer with her sand;</a>
<a id='line_4665'>    For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae</a>
<a id='line_4666'>    She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,</a>
<a id='line_4667'></a>
<a id='line_4668'>Neither so many plagues nor so malignant</a>
<a id='line_4669'>    E’er showed she with all Ethiopia,</a>
<a id='line_4670'>    Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!</a>
<a id='line_4671'></a>
<a id='line_4672'>Among this cruel and most dismal throng</a>
<a id='line_4673'>    People were running naked and affrighted.</a>
<a id='line_4674'>    Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.</a>
<a id='line_4675'></a>
<a id='line_4676'>They had their hands with serpents bound behind them;</a>
<a id='line_4677'>    These riveted upon their reins the tail</a>
<a id='line_4678'>    And head, and were in front of them entwined.</a>
<a id='line_4679'></a>
<a id='line_4680'>And lo! at one who was upon our side</a>
<a id='line_4681'>    There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him</a>
<a id='line_4682'>    There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.</a>
<a id='line_4683'></a>
<a id='line_4684'>Nor ‘O’ so quickly e’er, nor ‘I’ was written,</a>
<a id='line_4685'>    As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly</a>
<a id='line_4686'>    Behoved it that in falling he became.</a>
<a id='line_4687'></a>
<a id='line_4688'>And when he on the ground was thus destroyed,</a>
<a id='line_4689'>    The ashes drew together, and of themselves</a>
<a id='line_4690'>    Into himself they instantly returned.</a>
<a id='line_4691'></a>
<a id='line_4692'>Even thus by the great sages ’tis confessed</a>
<a id='line_4693'>    The phoenix dies, and then is born again,</a>
<a id='line_4694'>    When it approaches its five-hundredth year;</a>
<a id='line_4695'></a>
<a id='line_4696'>On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,</a>
<a id='line_4697'>    But only on tears of incense and amomum,</a>
<a id='line_4698'>    And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.</a>
<a id='line_4699'></a>
<a id='line_4700'>And as he is who falls, and knows not how,</a>
<a id='line_4701'>    By force of demons who to earth down drag him,</a>
<a id='line_4702'>    Or other oppilation that binds man,</a>
<a id='line_4703'></a>
<a id='line_4704'>When he arises and around him looks,</a>
<a id='line_4705'>    Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish</a>
<a id='line_4706'>    Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;</a>
<a id='line_4707'></a>
<a id='line_4708'>Such was that sinner after he had risen.</a>
<a id='line_4709'>    Justice of God! O how severe it is,</a>
<a id='line_4710'>    That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!</a>
<a id='line_4711'></a>
<a id='line_4712'>The Guide thereafter asked him who he was;</a>
<a id='line_4713'>    Whence he replied: “I rained from Tuscany</a>
<a id='line_4714'>    A short time since into this cruel gorge.</a>
<a id='line_4715'></a>
<a id='line_4716'>A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,</a>
<a id='line_4717'>    Even as the mule I was; I’m Vanni Fucci,</a>
<a id='line_4718'>    Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den.”</a>
<a id='line_4719'></a>
<a id='line_4720'>And I unto the Guide: “Tell him to stir not,</a>
<a id='line_4721'>    And ask what crime has thrust him here below,</a>
<a id='line_4722'>    For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him.”</a>
<a id='line_4723'></a>
<a id='line_4724'>And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,</a>
<a id='line_4725'>    But unto me directed mind and face,</a>
<a id='line_4726'>    And with a melancholy shame was painted.</a>
<a id='line_4727'></a>
<a id='line_4728'>Then said: “It pains me more that thou hast caught me</a>
<a id='line_4729'>    Amid this misery where thou seest me,</a>
<a id='line_4730'>    Than when I from the other life was taken.</a>
<a id='line_4731'></a>
<a id='line_4732'>What thou demandest I cannot deny;</a>
<a id='line_4733'>    So low am I put down because I robbed</a>
<a id='line_4734'>    The sacristy of the fair ornaments,</a>
<a id='line_4735'></a>
<a id='line_4736'>And falsely once ’twas laid upon another;</a>
<a id='line_4737'>    But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,</a>
<a id='line_4738'>    If thou shalt e’er be out of the dark places,</a>
<a id='line_4739'></a>
<a id='line_4740'>Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear:</a>
<a id='line_4741'>    Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;</a>
<a id='line_4742'>    Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;</a>
<a id='line_4743'></a>
<a id='line_4744'>Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra,</a>
<a id='line_4745'>    Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,</a>
<a id='line_4746'>    And with impetuous and bitter tempest</a>
<a id='line_4747'></a>
<a id='line_4748'>Over Campo Picen shall be the battle;</a>
<a id='line_4749'>    When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,</a>
<a id='line_4750'>    So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten.</a>
<a id='line_4751'></a>
<a id='line_4752'>And this I’ve said that it may give thee pain.”</a>
<a id='line_4753'></a>

<a id='line_4756'></a>
<a id='line_4757'>Inferno: Canto XXV</a>
<a id='line_4758'></a>
<a id='line_4759'></a>
<a id='line_4760'>At the conclusion of his words, the thief</a>
<a id='line_4761'>    Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs,</a>
<a id='line_4762'>    Crying: “Take that, God, for at thee I aim them.”</a>
<a id='line_4763'></a>
<a id='line_4764'>From that time forth the serpents were my friends;</a>
<a id='line_4765'>    For one entwined itself about his neck</a>
<a id='line_4766'>    As if it said: “I will not thou speak more;”</a>
<a id='line_4767'></a>
<a id='line_4768'>And round his arms another, and rebound him,</a>
<a id='line_4769'>    Clinching itself together so in front,</a>
<a id='line_4770'>    That with them he could not a motion make.</a>
<a id='line_4771'></a>
<a id='line_4772'>Pistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not</a>
<a id='line_4773'>    To burn thyself to ashes and so perish,</a>
<a id='line_4774'>    Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?</a>
<a id='line_4775'></a>
<a id='line_4776'>Through all the sombre circles of this Hell,</a>
<a id='line_4777'>    Spirit I saw not against God so proud,</a>
<a id='line_4778'>    Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!</a>
<a id='line_4779'></a>
<a id='line_4780'>He fled away, and spake no further word;</a>
<a id='line_4781'>    And I beheld a Centaur full of rage</a>
<a id='line_4782'>    Come crying out: “Where is, where is the scoffer?”</a>
<a id='line_4783'></a>
<a id='line_4784'>I do not think Maremma has so many</a>
<a id='line_4785'>    Serpents as he had all along his back,</a>
<a id='line_4786'>    As far as where our countenance begins.</a>
<a id='line_4787'></a>
<a id='line_4788'>Upon the shoulders, just behind the nape,</a>
<a id='line_4789'>    With wings wide open was a dragon lying,</a>
<a id='line_4790'>    And he sets fire to all that he encounters.</a>
<a id='line_4791'></a>
<a id='line_4792'>My Master said: “That one is Cacus, who</a>
<a id='line_4793'>    Beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine</a>
<a id='line_4794'>    Created oftentimes a lake of blood.</a>
<a id='line_4795'></a>
<a id='line_4796'>He goes not on the same road with his brothers,</a>
<a id='line_4797'>    By reason of the fraudulent theft he made</a>
<a id='line_4798'>    Of the great herd, which he had near to him;</a>
<a id='line_4799'></a>
<a id='line_4800'>Whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath</a>
<a id='line_4801'>    The mace of Hercules, who peradventure</a>
<a id='line_4802'>    Gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten.”</a>
<a id='line_4803'></a>
<a id='line_4804'>While he was speaking thus, he had passed by,</a>
<a id='line_4805'>    And spirits three had underneath us come,</a>
<a id='line_4806'>    Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,</a>
<a id='line_4807'></a>
<a id='line_4808'>Until what time they shouted: “Who are you?”</a>
<a id='line_4809'>    On which account our story made a halt,</a>
<a id='line_4810'>    And then we were intent on them alone.</a>
<a id='line_4811'></a>
<a id='line_4812'>I did not know them; but it came to pass,</a>
<a id='line_4813'>    As it is wont to happen by some chance,</a>
<a id='line_4814'>    That one to name the other was compelled,</a>
<a id='line_4815'></a>
<a id='line_4816'>Exclaiming: “Where can Cianfa have remained?”</a>
<a id='line_4817'>    Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,</a>
<a id='line_4818'>    Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.</a>
<a id='line_4819'></a>
<a id='line_4820'>If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe</a>
<a id='line_4821'>    What I shall say, it will no marvel be,</a>
<a id='line_4822'>    For I who saw it hardly can admit it.</a>
<a id='line_4823'></a>
<a id='line_4824'>As I was holding raised on them my brows,</a>
<a id='line_4825'>    Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth</a>
<a id='line_4826'>    In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.</a>
<a id='line_4827'></a>
<a id='line_4828'>With middle feet it bound him round the paunch,</a>
<a id='line_4829'>    And with the forward ones his arms it seized;</a>
<a id='line_4830'>    Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;</a>
<a id='line_4831'></a>
<a id='line_4832'>The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,</a>
<a id='line_4833'>    And put its tail through in between the two,</a>
<a id='line_4834'>    And up behind along the reins outspread it.</a>
<a id='line_4835'></a>
<a id='line_4836'>Ivy was never fastened by its barbs</a>
<a id='line_4837'>    Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile</a>
<a id='line_4838'>    Upon the other’s limbs entwined its own.</a>
<a id='line_4839'></a>
<a id='line_4840'>Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax</a>
<a id='line_4841'>    They had been made, and intermixed their colour;</a>
<a id='line_4842'>    Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;</a>
<a id='line_4843'></a>
<a id='line_4844'>E’en as proceedeth on before the flame</a>
<a id='line_4845'>    Upward along the paper a brown colour,</a>
<a id='line_4846'>    Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.</a>
<a id='line_4847'></a>
<a id='line_4848'>The other two looked on, and each of them</a>
<a id='line_4849'>    Cried out: “O me, Agnello, how thou changest!</a>
<a id='line_4850'>    Behold, thou now art neither two nor one.”</a>
<a id='line_4851'></a>
<a id='line_4852'>Already the two heads had one become,</a>
<a id='line_4853'>    When there appeared to us two figures mingled</a>
<a id='line_4854'>    Into one face, wherein the two were lost.</a>
<a id='line_4855'></a>
<a id='line_4856'>Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms,</a>
<a id='line_4857'>    The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest</a>
<a id='line_4858'>    Members became that never yet were seen.</a>
<a id='line_4859'></a>
<a id='line_4860'>Every original aspect there was cancelled;</a>
<a id='line_4861'>    Two and yet none did the perverted image</a>
<a id='line_4862'>    Appear, and such departed with slow pace.</a>
<a id='line_4863'></a>
<a id='line_4864'>Even as a lizard, under the great scourge</a>
<a id='line_4865'>    Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,</a>
<a id='line_4866'>    Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;</a>
<a id='line_4867'></a>
<a id='line_4868'>Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies</a>
<a id='line_4869'>    Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,</a>
<a id='line_4870'>    Livid and black as is a peppercorn.</a>
<a id='line_4871'></a>
<a id='line_4872'>And in that part whereat is first received</a>
<a id='line_4873'>    Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;</a>
<a id='line_4874'>    Then downward fell in front of him extended.</a>
<a id='line_4875'></a>
<a id='line_4876'>The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;</a>
<a id='line_4877'>    Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,</a>
<a id='line_4878'>    Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.</a>
<a id='line_4879'></a>
<a id='line_4880'>He at the serpent gazed, and it at him;</a>
<a id='line_4881'>    One through the wound, the other through the mouth</a>
<a id='line_4882'>    Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.</a>
<a id='line_4883'></a>
<a id='line_4884'>Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions</a>
<a id='line_4885'>    Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,</a>
<a id='line_4886'>    And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.</a>
<a id='line_4887'></a>
<a id='line_4888'>Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;</a>
<a id='line_4889'>    For if him to a snake, her to fountain,</a>
<a id='line_4890'>    Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;</a>
<a id='line_4891'></a>
<a id='line_4892'>Because two natures never front to front</a>
<a id='line_4893'>    Has he transmuted, so that both the forms</a>
<a id='line_4894'>    To interchange their matter ready were.</a>
<a id='line_4895'></a>
<a id='line_4896'>Together they responded in such wise,</a>
<a id='line_4897'>    That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,</a>
<a id='line_4898'>    And eke the wounded drew his feet together.</a>
<a id='line_4899'></a>
<a id='line_4900'>The legs together with the thighs themselves</a>
<a id='line_4901'>    Adhered so, that in little time the juncture</a>
<a id='line_4902'>    No sign whatever made that was apparent.</a>
<a id='line_4903'></a>
<a id='line_4904'>He with the cloven tail assumed the figure</a>
<a id='line_4905'>    The other one was losing, and his skin</a>
<a id='line_4906'>    Became elastic, and the other’s hard.</a>
<a id='line_4907'></a>
<a id='line_4908'>I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,</a>
<a id='line_4909'>    And both feet of the reptile, that were short,</a>
<a id='line_4910'>    Lengthen as much as those contracted were.</a>
<a id='line_4911'></a>
<a id='line_4912'>Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted,</a>
<a id='line_4913'>    Became the member that a man conceals,</a>
<a id='line_4914'>    And of his own the wretch had two created.</a>
<a id='line_4915'></a>
<a id='line_4916'>While both of them the exhalation veils</a>
<a id='line_4917'>    With a new colour, and engenders hair</a>
<a id='line_4918'>    On one of them and depilates the other,</a>
<a id='line_4919'></a>
<a id='line_4920'>The one uprose and down the other fell,</a>
<a id='line_4921'>    Though turning not away their impious lamps,</a>
<a id='line_4922'>    Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.</a>
<a id='line_4923'></a>
<a id='line_4924'>He who was standing drew it tow’rds the temples,</a>
<a id='line_4925'>    And from excess of matter, which came thither,</a>
<a id='line_4926'>    Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;</a>
<a id='line_4927'></a>
<a id='line_4928'>What did not backward run and was retained</a>
<a id='line_4929'>    Of that excess made to the face a nose,</a>
<a id='line_4930'>    And the lips thickened far as was befitting.</a>
<a id='line_4931'></a>
<a id='line_4932'>He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,</a>
<a id='line_4933'>    And backward draws the ears into his head,</a>
<a id='line_4934'>    In the same manner as the snail its horns;</a>
<a id='line_4935'></a>
<a id='line_4936'>And so the tongue, which was entire and apt</a>
<a id='line_4937'>    For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked</a>
<a id='line_4938'>    In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.</a>
<a id='line_4939'></a>
<a id='line_4940'>The soul, which to a reptile had been changed,</a>
<a id='line_4941'>    Along the valley hissing takes to flight,</a>
<a id='line_4942'>    And after him the other speaking sputters.</a>
<a id='line_4943'></a>
<a id='line_4944'>Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders,</a>
<a id='line_4945'>    And said to the other: “I’ll have Buoso run,</a>
<a id='line_4946'>    Crawling as I have done, along this road.”</a>
<a id='line_4947'></a>
<a id='line_4948'>In this way I beheld the seventh ballast</a>
<a id='line_4949'>    Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse</a>
<a id='line_4950'>    The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.</a>
<a id='line_4951'></a>
<a id='line_4952'>And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be</a>
<a id='line_4953'>    Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,</a>
<a id='line_4954'>    They could not flee away so secretly</a>
<a id='line_4955'></a>
<a id='line_4956'>But that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;</a>
<a id='line_4957'>    And he it was who sole of three companions,</a>
<a id='line_4958'>    Which came in the beginning, was not changed;</a>
<a id='line_4959'></a>
<a id='line_4960'>The other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.</a>
<a id='line_4961'></a>
<a id='line_4962'></a>
<a id='line_4963'></a>
<a id='line_4964'></a>
<a id='line_4965'>Inferno: Canto XXVI</a>
<a id='line_4966'></a>
<a id='line_4967'></a>
<a id='line_4968'>Rejoice, O Florence, since thou art so great,</a>
<a id='line_4969'>    That over sea and land thou beatest thy wings,</a>
<a id='line_4970'>    And throughout Hell thy name is spread abroad!</a>
<a id='line_4971'></a>
<a id='line_4972'>Among the thieves five citizens of thine</a>
<a id='line_4973'>    Like these I found, whence shame comes unto me,</a>
<a id='line_4974'>    And thou thereby to no great honour risest.</a>
<a id='line_4975'></a>
<a id='line_4976'>But if when morn is near our dreams are true,</a>
<a id='line_4977'>    Feel shalt thou in a little time from now</a>
<a id='line_4978'>    What Prato, if none other, craves for thee.</a>
<a id='line_4979'></a>
<a id='line_4980'>And if it now were, it were not too soon;</a>
<a id='line_4981'>    Would that it were, seeing it needs must be,</a>
<a id='line_4982'>    For ’twill aggrieve me more the more I age.</a>
<a id='line_4983'></a>
<a id='line_4984'>We went our way, and up along the stairs</a>
<a id='line_4985'>    The bourns had made us to descend before,</a>
<a id='line_4986'>    Remounted my Conductor and drew me.</a>
<a id='line_4987'></a>
<a id='line_4988'>And following the solitary path</a>
<a id='line_4989'>    Among the rocks and ridges of the crag,</a>
<a id='line_4990'>    The foot without the hand sped not at all.</a>
<a id='line_4991'></a>
<a id='line_4992'>Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,</a>
<a id='line_4993'>    When I direct my mind to what I saw,</a>
<a id='line_4994'>    And more my genius curb than I am wont,</a>
<a id='line_4995'></a>
<a id='line_4996'>That it may run not unless virtue guide it;</a>
<a id='line_4997'>    So that if some good star, or better thing,</a>
<a id='line_4998'>    Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.</a>
<a id='line_4999'></a>
<a id='line_5000'>As many as the hind (who on the hill</a>
<a id='line_5001'>    Rests at the time when he who lights the world</a>
<a id='line_5002'>    His countenance keeps least concealed from us,</a>
<a id='line_5003'></a>
<a id='line_5004'>While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)</a>
<a id='line_5005'>    Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley,</a>
<a id='line_5006'>    Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;</a>
<a id='line_5007'></a>
<a id='line_5008'>With flames as manifold resplendent all</a>
<a id='line_5009'>    Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware</a>
<a id='line_5010'>    As soon as I was where the depth appeared.</a>
<a id='line_5011'></a>
<a id='line_5012'>And such as he who with the bears avenged him</a>
<a id='line_5013'>    Beheld Elijah’s chariot at departing,</a>
<a id='line_5014'>    What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,</a>
<a id='line_5015'></a>
<a id='line_5016'>For with his eye he could not follow it</a>
<a id='line_5017'>    So as to see aught else than flame alone,</a>
<a id='line_5018'>    Even as a little cloud ascending upward,</a>
<a id='line_5019'></a>
<a id='line_5020'>Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment</a>
<a id='line_5021'>    Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,</a>
<a id='line_5022'>    And every flame a sinner steals away.</a>
<a id='line_5023'></a>
<a id='line_5024'>I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,</a>
<a id='line_5025'>    So that, if I had seized not on a rock,</a>
<a id='line_5026'>    Down had I fallen without being pushed.</a>
<a id='line_5027'></a>
<a id='line_5028'>And the Leader, who beheld me so attent,</a>
<a id='line_5029'>    Exclaimed: “Within the fires the spirits are;</a>
<a id='line_5030'>    Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns.”</a>
<a id='line_5031'></a>
<a id='line_5032'>“My Master,” I replied, “by hearing thee</a>
<a id='line_5033'>    I am more sure; but I surmised already</a>
<a id='line_5034'>    It might be so, and already wished to ask thee</a>
<a id='line_5035'></a>
<a id='line_5036'>Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft</a>
<a id='line_5037'>    At top, it seems uprising from the pyre</a>
<a id='line_5038'>    Where was Eteocles with his brother placed.”</a>
<a id='line_5039'></a>
<a id='line_5040'>He answered me: “Within there are tormented</a>
<a id='line_5041'>    Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together</a>
<a id='line_5042'>    They unto vengeance run as unto wrath.</a>
<a id='line_5043'></a>
<a id='line_5044'>And there within their flame do they lament</a>
<a id='line_5045'>    The ambush of the horse, which made the door</a>
<a id='line_5046'>    Whence issued forth the Romans’ gentle seed;</a>
<a id='line_5047'></a>
<a id='line_5048'>Therein is wept the craft, for which being dead</a>
<a id='line_5049'>    Deidamia still deplores Achilles,</a>
<a id='line_5050'>    And pain for the Palladium there is borne.”</a>
<a id='line_5051'></a>
<a id='line_5052'>“If they within those sparks possess the power</a>
<a id='line_5053'>    To speak,” I said, “thee, Master, much I pray,</a>
<a id='line_5054'>    And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,</a>
<a id='line_5055'></a>
<a id='line_5056'>That thou make no denial of awaiting</a>
<a id='line_5057'>    Until the horned flame shall hither come;</a>
<a id='line_5058'>    Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it.”</a>
<a id='line_5059'></a>
<a id='line_5060'>And he to me: “Worthy is thy entreaty</a>
<a id='line_5061'>    Of much applause, and therefore I accept it;</a>
<a id='line_5062'>    But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself.</a>
<a id='line_5063'></a>
<a id='line_5064'>Leave me to speak, because I have conceived</a>
<a id='line_5065'>    That which thou wishest; for they might disdain</a>
<a id='line_5066'>    Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine.”</a>
<a id='line_5067'></a>
<a id='line_5068'>When now the flame had come unto that point,</a>
<a id='line_5069'>    Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,</a>
<a id='line_5070'>    After this fashion did I hear him speak:</a>
<a id='line_5071'></a>
<a id='line_5072'>“O ye, who are twofold within one fire,</a>
<a id='line_5073'>    If I deserved of you, while I was living,</a>
<a id='line_5074'>    If I deserved of you or much or little</a>
<a id='line_5075'></a>
<a id='line_5076'>When in the world I wrote the lofty verses,</a>
<a id='line_5077'>    Do not move on, but one of you declare</a>
<a id='line_5078'>    Whither, being lost, he went away to die.”</a>
<a id='line_5079'></a>
<a id='line_5080'>Then of the antique flame the greater horn,</a>
<a id='line_5081'>    Murmuring, began to wave itself about</a>
<a id='line_5082'>    Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.</a>
<a id='line_5083'></a>
<a id='line_5084'>Thereafterward, the summit to and fro</a>
<a id='line_5085'>    Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,</a>
<a id='line_5086'>    It uttered forth a voice, and said: “When I</a>
<a id='line_5087'></a>
<a id='line_5088'>From Circe had departed, who concealed me</a>
<a id='line_5089'>    More than a year there near unto Gaeta,</a>
<a id='line_5090'>    Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,</a>
<a id='line_5091'></a>
<a id='line_5092'>Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence</a>
<a id='line_5093'>    For my old father, nor the due affection</a>
<a id='line_5094'>    Which joyous should have made Penelope,</a>
<a id='line_5095'></a>
<a id='line_5096'>Could overcome within me the desire</a>
<a id='line_5097'>    I had to be experienced of the world,</a>
<a id='line_5098'>    And of the vice and virtue of mankind;</a>
<a id='line_5099'></a>
<a id='line_5100'>But I put forth on the high open sea</a>
<a id='line_5101'>    With one sole ship, and that small company</a>
<a id='line_5102'>    By which I never had deserted been.</a>
<a id='line_5103'></a>
<a id='line_5104'>Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,</a>
<a id='line_5105'>    Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,</a>
<a id='line_5106'>    And the others which that sea bathes round about.</a>
<a id='line_5107'></a>
<a id='line_5108'>I and my company were old and slow</a>
<a id='line_5109'>    When at that narrow passage we arrived</a>
<a id='line_5110'>    Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,</a>
<a id='line_5111'></a>
<a id='line_5112'>That man no farther onward should adventure.</a>
<a id='line_5113'>    On the right hand behind me left I Seville,</a>
<a id='line_5114'>    And on the other already had left Ceuta.</a>
<a id='line_5115'></a>
<a id='line_5116'>‘O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand</a>
<a id='line_5117'>    Perils,’ I said, ‘have come unto the West,</a>
<a id='line_5118'>    To this so inconsiderable vigil</a>
<a id='line_5119'></a>
<a id='line_5120'>Which is remaining of your senses still</a>
<a id='line_5121'>    Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,</a>
<a id='line_5122'>    Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.</a>
<a id='line_5123'></a>
<a id='line_5124'>Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;</a>
<a id='line_5125'>    Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,</a>
<a id='line_5126'>    But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.’</a>
<a id='line_5127'></a>
<a id='line_5128'>So eager did I render my companions,</a>
<a id='line_5129'>    With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,</a>
<a id='line_5130'>    That then I hardly could have held them back.</a>
<a id='line_5131'></a>
<a id='line_5132'>And having turned our stern unto the morning,</a>
<a id='line_5133'>    We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,</a>
<a id='line_5134'>    Evermore gaining on the larboard side.</a>
<a id='line_5135'></a>
<a id='line_5136'>Already all the stars of the other pole</a>
<a id='line_5137'>    The night beheld, and ours so very low</a>
<a id='line_5138'>    It did not rise above the ocean floor.</a>
<a id='line_5139'></a>
<a id='line_5140'>Five times rekindled and as many quenched</a>
<a id='line_5141'>    Had been the splendour underneath the moon,</a>
<a id='line_5142'>    Since we had entered into the deep pass,</a>
<a id='line_5143'></a>
<a id='line_5144'>When there appeared to us a mountain, dim</a>
<a id='line_5145'>    From distance, and it seemed to me so high</a>
<a id='line_5146'>    As I had never any one beheld.</a>
<a id='line_5147'></a>
<a id='line_5148'>Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;</a>
<a id='line_5149'>    For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,</a>
<a id='line_5150'>    And smote upon the fore part of the ship.</a>
<a id='line_5151'></a>
<a id='line_5152'>Three times it made her whirl with all the waters,</a>
<a id='line_5153'>    At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,</a>
<a id='line_5154'>    And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,</a>
<a id='line_5155'></a>
<a id='line_5156'>Until the sea above us closed again.”</a>

<a id='line_5166'>    With the permission of the gentle Poet;</a>
<a id='line_5167'></a>
<a id='line_5168'>When yet another, which behind it came,</a>
<a id='line_5169'>    Caused us to turn our eyes upon its top</a>
<a id='line_5170'>    By a confused sound that issued from it.</a>
<a id='line_5171'></a>
<a id='line_5172'>As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first</a>

<a id='line_5175'></a>

<a id='line_5179'></a>
<a id='line_5180'>Thus, by not having any way or issue</a>
<a id='line_5181'>    At first from out the fire, to its own language</a>
<a id='line_5182'>    Converted were the melancholy words.</a>
<a id='line_5183'></a>
<a id='line_5184'>But afterwards, when they had gathered way</a>
<a id='line_5185'>    Up through the point, giving it that vibration</a>
<a id='line_5186'>    The tongue had given them in their passage out,</a>
<a id='line_5187'></a>
<a id='line_5188'>We heard it said: “O thou, at whom I aim</a>

<a id='line_5191'></a>
<a id='line_5192'>Because I come perchance a little late,</a>

<a id='line_5203'></a>
<a id='line_5204'>I still was downward bent and listening,</a>
<a id='line_5205'>    When my Conductor touched me on the side,</a>
<a id='line_5206'>    Saying: “Speak thou: this one a Latian is.”</a>
<a id='line_5207'></a>
<a id='line_5208'>And I, who had beforehand my reply</a>
<a id='line_5209'>    In readiness, forthwith began to speak:</a>

<a id='line_5233'>    Even as it lies between the plain and mountain,</a>
<a id='line_5234'>    Lives between tyranny and a free state.</a>
<a id='line_5235'></a>
<a id='line_5236'>Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art;</a>
<a id='line_5237'>    Be not more stubborn than the rest have been,</a>
<a id='line_5238'>    So may thy name hold front there in the world.”</a>
<a id='line_5239'></a>
<a id='line_5240'>After the fire a little more had roared</a>
<a id='line_5241'>    In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved</a>
<a id='line_5242'>    This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:</a>
<a id='line_5243'></a>
<a id='line_5244'>“If I believed that my reply were made</a>
<a id='line_5245'>    To one who to the world would e’er return,</a>
<a id='line_5246'>    This flame without more flickering would stand still;</a>
<a id='line_5247'></a>
<a id='line_5248'>But inasmuch as never from this depth</a>
<a id='line_5249'>    Did any one return, if I hear true,</a>
<a id='line_5250'>    Without the fear of infamy I answer,</a>
<a id='line_5251'></a>
<a id='line_5252'>I was a man of arms, then Cordelier,</a>

<a id='line_5254'>    And truly my belief had been fulfilled</a>
<a id='line_5255'></a>
<a id='line_5256'>But for the High Priest, whom may ill betide,</a>

<a id='line_5258'>    And how and wherefore I will have thee hear.</a>
<a id='line_5259'></a>
<a id='line_5260'>While I was still the form of bone and pulp</a>
<a id='line_5261'>    My mother gave to me, the deeds I did</a>
<a id='line_5262'>    Were not those of a lion, but a fox.</a>
<a id='line_5263'></a>
<a id='line_5264'>The machinations and the covert ways</a>
<a id='line_5265'>    I knew them all, and practised so their craft,</a>
<a id='line_5266'>    That to the ends of earth the sound went forth.</a>
<a id='line_5267'></a>
<a id='line_5268'>When now unto that portion of mine age</a>
<a id='line_5269'>    I saw myself arrived, when each one ought</a>
<a id='line_5270'>    To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,</a>
<a id='line_5271'></a>
<a id='line_5272'>That which before had pleased me then displeased me;</a>
<a id='line_5273'>    And penitent and confessing I surrendered,</a>
<a id='line_5274'>    Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;</a>
<a id='line_5275'></a>
<a id='line_5276'>The Leader of the modern Pharisees</a>
<a id='line_5277'>    Having a war near unto Lateran,</a>
<a id='line_5278'>    And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,</a>
<a id='line_5279'></a>
<a id='line_5280'>For each one of his enemies was Christian,</a>
<a id='line_5281'>    And none of them had been to conquer Acre,</a>
<a id='line_5282'>    Nor merchandising in the Sultan’s land,</a>
<a id='line_5283'></a>
<a id='line_5284'>Nor the high office, nor the sacred orders,</a>
<a id='line_5285'>    In him regarded, nor in me that cord</a>
<a id='line_5286'>    Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;</a>
<a id='line_5287'></a>
<a id='line_5288'>But even as Constantine sought out Sylvester</a>
<a id='line_5289'>    To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,</a>
<a id='line_5290'>    So this one sought me out as an adept</a>
<a id='line_5291'></a>
<a id='line_5292'>To cure him of the fever of his pride.</a>
<a id='line_5293'>    Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,</a>
<a id='line_5294'>    Because his words appeared inebriate.</a>
<a id='line_5295'></a>
<a id='line_5296'>And then he said: ‘Be not thy heart afraid;</a>
<a id='line_5297'>    Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me</a>
<a id='line_5298'>    How to raze Palestrina to the ground.</a>
<a id='line_5299'></a>
<a id='line_5300'>Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock,</a>
<a id='line_5301'>    As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,</a>
<a id='line_5302'>    The which my predecessor held not dear.’</a>
<a id='line_5303'></a>
<a id='line_5304'>Then urged me on his weighty arguments</a>
<a id='line_5305'>    There, where my silence was the worst advice;</a>
<a id='line_5306'>    And said I: ‘Father, since thou washest me</a>
<a id='line_5307'></a>
<a id='line_5308'>Of that sin into which I now must fall,</a>
<a id='line_5309'>    The promise long with the fulfilment short</a>
<a id='line_5310'>    Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.’</a>
<a id='line_5311'></a>
<a id='line_5312'>Francis came afterward, when I was dead,</a>
<a id='line_5313'>    For me; but one of the black Cherubim</a>
<a id='line_5314'>    Said to him: ‘Take him not; do me no wrong;</a>
<a id='line_5315'></a>
<a id='line_5316'>He must come down among my servitors,</a>
<a id='line_5317'>    Because he gave the fraudulent advice</a>
<a id='line_5318'>    From which time forth I have been at his hair;</a>
<a id='line_5319'></a>
<a id='line_5320'>For who repents not cannot be absolved,</a>
<a id='line_5321'>    Nor can one both repent and will at once,</a>
<a id='line_5322'>    Because of the contradiction which consents not.’</a>
<a id='line_5323'></a>
<a id='line_5324'>O miserable me! how I did shudder</a>
<a id='line_5325'>    When he seized on me, saying: ‘Peradventure</a>
<a id='line_5326'>    Thou didst not think that I was a logician!’</a>
<a id='line_5327'></a>
<a id='line_5328'>He bore me unto Minos, who entwined</a>
<a id='line_5329'>    Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,</a>
<a id='line_5330'>    And after he had bitten it in great rage,</a>
<a id='line_5331'></a>
<a id='line_5332'>Said: ‘Of the thievish fire a culprit this;’</a>
<a id='line_5333'>    Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,</a>
<a id='line_5334'>    And vested thus in going I bemoan me.”</a>
<a id='line_5335'></a>
<a id='line_5336'>When it had thus completed its recital,</a>
<a id='line_5337'>    The flame departed uttering lamentations,</a>
<a id='line_5338'>    Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.</a>
<a id='line_5339'></a>
<a id='line_5340'>Onward we passed, both I and my Conductor,</a>

<a id='line_5436'>Another one, who had his throat pierced through,</a>
<a id='line_5437'>    And nose cut off close underneath the brows,</a>
<a id='line_5438'>    And had no longer but a single ear,</a>
<a id='line_5439'></a>
<a id='line_5440'>Staying to look in wonder with the others,</a>
<a id='line_5441'>    Before the others did his gullet open,</a>
<a id='line_5442'>    Which outwardly was red in every part,</a>
<a id='line_5443'></a>
<a id='line_5444'>And said: “O thou, whom guilt doth not condemn,</a>
<a id='line_5445'>    And whom I once saw up in Latian land,</a>
<a id='line_5446'>    Unless too great similitude deceive me,</a>
<a id='line_5447'></a>
<a id='line_5448'>Call to remembrance Pier da Medicina,</a>
<a id='line_5449'>    If e’er thou see again the lovely plain</a>
<a id='line_5450'>    That from Vercelli slopes to Marcabo,</a>
<a id='line_5451'></a>
<a id='line_5452'>And make it known to the best two of Fano,</a>
<a id='line_5453'>    To Messer Guido and Angiolello likewise,</a>
<a id='line_5454'>    That if foreseeing here be not in vain,</a>
<a id='line_5455'></a>
<a id='line_5456'>Cast over from their vessel shall they be,</a>
<a id='line_5457'>    And drowned near unto the Cattolica,</a>
<a id='line_5458'>    By the betrayal of a tyrant fell.</a>
<a id='line_5459'></a>
<a id='line_5460'>Between the isles of Cyprus and Majorca</a>
<a id='line_5461'>    Neptune ne’er yet beheld so great a crime,</a>
<a id='line_5462'>    Neither of pirates nor Argolic people.</a>
<a id='line_5463'></a>
<a id='line_5464'>That traitor, who sees only with one eye,</a>
<a id='line_5465'>    And holds the land, which some one here with me</a>
<a id='line_5466'>    Would fain be fasting from the vision of,</a>
<a id='line_5467'></a>
<a id='line_5468'>Will make them come unto a parley with him;</a>
<a id='line_5469'>    Then will do so, that to Focara’s wind</a>
<a id='line_5470'>    They will not stand in need of vow or prayer.”</a>
<a id='line_5471'></a>
<a id='line_5472'>And I to him: “Show to me and declare,</a>
<a id='line_5473'>    If thou wouldst have me bear up news of thee,</a>
<a id='line_5474'>    Who is this person of the bitter vision.”</a>
<a id='line_5475'></a>
<a id='line_5476'>Then did he lay his hand upon the jaw</a>
<a id='line_5477'>    Of one of his companions, and his mouth</a>
<a id='line_5478'>    Oped, crying: “This is he, and he speaks not.</a>
<a id='line_5479'></a>
<a id='line_5480'>This one, being banished, every doubt submerged</a>
<a id='line_5481'>    In Caesar by affirming the forearmed</a>
<a id='line_5482'>    Always with detriment allowed delay.”</a>
<a id='line_5483'></a>
<a id='line_5484'>O how bewildered unto me appeared,</a>
<a id='line_5485'>    With tongue asunder in his windpipe slit,</a>
<a id='line_5486'>    Curio, who in speaking was so bold!</a>
<a id='line_5487'></a>
<a id='line_5488'>And one, who both his hands dissevered had,</a>
<a id='line_5489'>    The stumps uplifting through the murky air,</a>
<a id='line_5490'>    So that the blood made horrible his face,</a>
<a id='line_5491'></a>
<a id='line_5492'>Cried out: “Thou shalt remember Mosca also,</a>
<a id='line_5493'>    Who said, alas! ‘A thing done has an end!’</a>
<a id='line_5494'>    Which was an ill seed for the Tuscan people.”</a>
<a id='line_5495'></a>
<a id='line_5496'>“And death unto thy race,” thereto I added;</a>
<a id='line_5497'>    Whence he, accumulating woe on woe,</a>
<a id='line_5498'>    Departed, like a person sad and crazed.</a>
<a id='line_5499'></a>
<a id='line_5500'>But I remained to look upon the crowd;</a>
<a id='line_5501'>    And saw a thing which I should be afraid,</a>
<a id='line_5502'>    Without some further proof, even to recount,</a>
<a id='line_5503'></a>
<a id='line_5504'>If it were not that conscience reassures me,</a>
<a id='line_5505'>    That good companion which emboldens man</a>
<a id='line_5506'>    Beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure.</a>
<a id='line_5507'></a>
<a id='line_5508'>I truly saw, and still I seem to see it,</a>
<a id='line_5509'>    A trunk without a head walk in like manner</a>
<a id='line_5510'>    As walked the others of the mournful herd.</a>
<a id='line_5511'></a>
<a id='line_5512'>And by the hair it held the head dissevered,</a>
<a id='line_5513'>    Hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern,</a>
<a id='line_5514'>    And that upon us gazed and said: “O me!”</a>
<a id='line_5515'></a>
<a id='line_5516'>It of itself made to itself a lamp,</a>
<a id='line_5517'>    And they were two in one, and one in two;</a>
<a id='line_5518'>    How that can be, He knows who so ordains it.</a>
<a id='line_5519'></a>
<a id='line_5520'>When it was come close to the bridge’s foot,</a>
<a id='line_5521'>    It lifted high its arm with all the head,</a>
<a id='line_5522'>    To bring more closely unto us its words,</a>
<a id='line_5523'></a>
<a id='line_5524'>Which were: “Behold now the sore penalty,</a>
<a id='line_5525'>    Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding;</a>
<a id='line_5526'>    Behold if any be as great as this.</a>
<a id='line_5527'></a>
<a id='line_5528'>And so that thou may carry news of me,</a>
<a id='line_5529'>    Know that Bertram de Born am I, the same</a>
<a id='line_5530'>    Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort.</a>
<a id='line_5531'></a>
<a id='line_5532'>I made the father and the son rebellious;</a>
<a id='line_5533'>    Achitophel not more with Absalom</a>
<a id='line_5534'>    And David did with his accursed goadings.</a>
<a id='line_5535'></a>
<a id='line_5536'>Because I parted persons so united,</a>
<a id='line_5537'>    Parted do I now bear my brain, alas!</a>
<a id='line_5538'>    From its beginning, which is in this trunk.</a>
<a id='line_5539'></a>
<a id='line_5540'>Thus is observed in me the counterpoise.”</a>

<a id='line_5545'>Inferno: Canto XXIX</a>
<a id='line_5546'></a>
<a id='line_5547'></a>
<a id='line_5548'>The many people and the divers wounds</a>
<a id='line_5549'>    These eyes of mine had so inebriated,</a>
<a id='line_5550'>    That they were wishful to stand still and weep;</a>
<a id='line_5551'></a>
<a id='line_5552'>But said Virgilius: “What dost thou still gaze at?</a>
<a id='line_5553'>    Why is thy sight still riveted down there</a>
<a id='line_5554'>    Among the mournful, mutilated shades?</a>
<a id='line_5555'></a>
<a id='line_5556'>Thou hast not done so at the other Bolge;</a>
<a id='line_5557'>    Consider, if to count them thou believest,</a>
<a id='line_5558'>    That two-and-twenty miles the valley winds,</a>
<a id='line_5559'></a>
<a id='line_5560'>And now the moon is underneath our feet;</a>
<a id='line_5561'>    Henceforth the time allotted us is brief,</a>
<a id='line_5562'>    And more is to be seen than what thou seest.”</a>
<a id='line_5563'></a>
<a id='line_5564'>“If thou hadst,” I made answer thereupon,</a>
<a id='line_5565'>    “Attended to the cause for which I looked,</a>
<a id='line_5566'>    Perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned.”</a>
<a id='line_5567'></a>
<a id='line_5568'>Meanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him</a>
<a id='line_5569'>    I went, already making my reply,</a>
<a id='line_5570'>    And superadding: “In that cavern where</a>
<a id='line_5571'></a>
<a id='line_5572'>I held mine eyes with such attention fixed,</a>
<a id='line_5573'>    I think a spirit of my blood laments</a>
<a id='line_5574'>    The sin which down below there costs so much.”</a>
<a id='line_5575'></a>
<a id='line_5576'>Then said the Master: “Be no longer broken</a>
<a id='line_5577'>    Thy thought from this time forward upon him;</a>
<a id='line_5578'>    Attend elsewhere, and there let him remain;</a>
<a id='line_5579'></a>
<a id='line_5580'>For him I saw below the little bridge,</a>
<a id='line_5581'>    Pointing at thee, and threatening with his finger</a>
<a id='line_5582'>    Fiercely, and heard him called Geri del Bello.</a>
<a id='line_5583'></a>
<a id='line_5584'>So wholly at that time wast thou impeded</a>
<a id='line_5585'>    By him who formerly held Altaforte,</a>
<a id='line_5586'>    Thou didst not look that way; so he departed.”</a>
<a id='line_5587'></a>
<a id='line_5588'>“O my Conductor, his own violent death,</a>
<a id='line_5589'>    Which is not yet avenged for him,” I said,</a>
<a id='line_5590'>    “By any who is sharer in the shame,</a>
<a id='line_5591'></a>
<a id='line_5592'>Made him disdainful; whence he went away,</a>
<a id='line_5593'>    As I imagine, without speaking to me,</a>
<a id='line_5594'>    And thereby made me pity him the more.”</a>
<a id='line_5595'></a>
<a id='line_5596'>Thus did we speak as far as the first place</a>
<a id='line_5597'>    Upon the crag, which the next valley shows</a>
<a id='line_5598'>    Down to the bottom, if there were more light.</a>
<a id='line_5599'></a>
<a id='line_5600'>When we were now right over the last cloister</a>
<a id='line_5601'>    Of Malebolge, so that its lay-brothers</a>
<a id='line_5602'>    Could manifest themselves unto our sight,</a>
<a id='line_5603'></a>
<a id='line_5604'>Divers lamentings pierced me through and through,</a>
<a id='line_5605'>    Which with compassion had their arrows barbed,</a>
<a id='line_5606'>    Whereat mine ears I covered with my hands.</a>
<a id='line_5607'></a>
<a id='line_5608'>What pain would be, if from the hospitals</a>
<a id='line_5609'>    Of Valdichiana, ’twixt July and September,</a>
<a id='line_5610'>    And of Maremma and Sardinia</a>
<a id='line_5611'></a>
<a id='line_5612'>All the diseases in one moat were gathered,</a>
<a id='line_5613'>    Such was it here, and such a stench came from it</a>
<a id='line_5614'>    As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.</a>
<a id='line_5615'></a>
<a id='line_5616'>We had descended on the furthest bank</a>
<a id='line_5617'>    From the long crag, upon the left hand still,</a>
<a id='line_5618'>    And then more vivid was my power of sight</a>
<a id='line_5619'></a>
<a id='line_5620'>Down tow’rds the bottom, where the ministress</a>
<a id='line_5621'>    Of the high Lord, Justice infallible,</a>
<a id='line_5622'>    Punishes forgers, which she here records.</a>
<a id='line_5623'></a>
<a id='line_5624'>I do not think a sadder sight to see</a>
<a id='line_5625'>    Was in Aegina the whole people sick,</a>
<a id='line_5626'>    (When was the air so full of pestilence,</a>
<a id='line_5627'></a>
<a id='line_5628'>The animals, down to the little worm,</a>
<a id='line_5629'>    All fell, and afterwards the ancient people,</a>
<a id='line_5630'>    According as the poets have affirmed,</a>
<a id='line_5631'></a>
<a id='line_5632'>Were from the seed of ants restored again,)</a>
<a id='line_5633'>    Than was it to behold through that dark valley</a>
<a id='line_5634'>    The spirits languishing in divers heaps.</a>
<a id='line_5635'></a>
<a id='line_5636'>This on the belly, that upon the back</a>
<a id='line_5637'>    One of the other lay, and others crawling</a>
<a id='line_5638'>    Shifted themselves along the dismal road.</a>
<a id='line_5639'></a>
<a id='line_5640'>We step by step went onward without speech,</a>
<a id='line_5641'>    Gazing upon and listening to the sick</a>
<a id='line_5642'>    Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.</a>
<a id='line_5643'></a>
<a id='line_5644'>I saw two sitting leaned against each other,</a>
<a id='line_5645'>    As leans in heating platter against platter,</a>
<a id='line_5646'>    From head to foot bespotted o’er with scabs;</a>
<a id='line_5647'></a>
<a id='line_5648'>And never saw I plied a currycomb</a>
<a id='line_5649'>    By stable-boy for whom his master waits,</a>
<a id='line_5650'>    Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,</a>
<a id='line_5651'></a>
<a id='line_5652'>As every one was plying fast the bite</a>
<a id='line_5653'>    Of nails upon himself, for the great rage</a>
<a id='line_5654'>    Of itching which no other succour had.</a>
<a id='line_5655'></a>
<a id='line_5656'>And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,</a>
<a id='line_5657'>    In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,</a>
<a id='line_5658'>    Or any other fish that has them largest.</a>
<a id='line_5659'></a>
<a id='line_5660'>“O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,”</a>
<a id='line_5661'>    Began my Leader unto one of them,</a>
<a id='line_5662'>    “And makest of them pincers now and then,</a>
<a id='line_5663'></a>
<a id='line_5664'>Tell me if any Latian is with those</a>
<a id='line_5665'>    Who are herein; so may thy nails suffice thee</a>
<a id='line_5666'>    To all eternity unto this work.”</a>
<a id='line_5667'></a>
<a id='line_5668'>“Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,</a>
<a id='line_5669'>    Both of us here,” one weeping made reply;</a>
<a id='line_5670'>    “But who art thou, that questionest about us?”</a>
<a id='line_5671'></a>
<a id='line_5672'>And said the Guide: “One am I who descends</a>
<a id='line_5673'>    Down with this living man from cliff to cliff,</a>
<a id='line_5674'>    And I intend to show Hell unto him.”</a>
<a id='line_5675'></a>
<a id='line_5676'>Then broken was their mutual support,</a>
<a id='line_5677'>    And trembling each one turned himself to me,</a>
<a id='line_5678'>    With others who had heard him by rebound.</a>
<a id='line_5679'></a>
<a id='line_5680'>Wholly to me did the good Master gather,</a>
<a id='line_5681'>    Saying: “Say unto them whate’er thou wishest.”</a>
<a id='line_5682'>    And I began, since he would have it so:</a>
<a id='line_5683'></a>
<a id='line_5684'>“So may your memory not steal away</a>
<a id='line_5685'>    In the first world from out the minds of men,</a>
<a id='line_5686'>    But so may it survive ’neath many suns,</a>
<a id='line_5687'></a>
<a id='line_5688'>Say to me who ye are, and of what people;</a>
<a id='line_5689'>    Let not your foul and loathsome punishment</a>
<a id='line_5690'>    Make you afraid to show yourselves to me.”</a>
<a id='line_5691'></a>
<a id='line_5692'>“I of Arezzo was,” one made reply,</a>
<a id='line_5693'>    “And Albert of Siena had me burned;</a>
<a id='line_5694'>    But what I died for does not bring me here.</a>
<a id='line_5695'></a>
<a id='line_5696'>’Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest,</a>
<a id='line_5697'>    That I could rise by flight into the air,</a>
<a id='line_5698'>    And he who had conceit, but little wit,</a>
<a id='line_5699'></a>
<a id='line_5700'>Would have me show to him the art; and only</a>
<a id='line_5701'>    Because no Daedalus I made him, made me</a>
<a id='line_5702'>    Be burned by one who held him as his son.</a>
<a id='line_5703'></a>
<a id='line_5704'>But unto the last Bolgia of the ten,</a>
<a id='line_5705'>    For alchemy, which in the world I practised,</a>
<a id='line_5706'>    Minos, who cannot err, has me condemned.”</a>
<a id='line_5707'></a>
<a id='line_5708'>And to the Poet said I: “Now was ever</a>
<a id='line_5709'>    So vain a people as the Sienese?</a>
<a id='line_5710'>    Not for a certainty the French by far.”</a>
<a id='line_5711'></a>
<a id='line_5712'>Whereat the other leper, who had heard me,</a>
<a id='line_5713'>    Replied unto my speech: “Taking out Stricca,</a>
<a id='line_5714'>    Who knew the art of moderate expenses,</a>
<a id='line_5715'></a>
<a id='line_5716'>And Niccolo, who the luxurious use</a>
<a id='line_5717'>    Of cloves discovered earliest of all</a>
<a id='line_5718'>    Within that garden where such seed takes root;</a>
<a id='line_5719'></a>
<a id='line_5720'>And taking out the band, among whom squandered</a>
<a id='line_5721'>    Caccia d’Ascian his vineyards and vast woods,</a>
<a id='line_5722'>    And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!</a>
<a id='line_5723'></a>
<a id='line_5724'>But, that thou know who thus doth second thee</a>

<a id='line_5726'>    Tow’rds me, so that my face well answer thee,</a>
<a id='line_5727'></a>
<a id='line_5728'>And thou shalt see I am Capocchio’s shade,</a>

<a id='line_5730'>    Thou must remember, if I well descry thee,</a>
<a id='line_5731'></a>

<a id='line_5743'></a>

<a id='line_5778'>    It made his belly grate the solid bottom.</a>
<a id='line_5779'></a>
<a id='line_5780'>And the Aretine, who trembling had remained,</a>
<a id='line_5781'>    Said to me: “That mad sprite is Gianni Schicchi,</a>
<a id='line_5782'>    And raving goes thus harrying other people.”</a>
<a id='line_5783'></a>
<a id='line_5784'>“O,” said I to him, “so may not the other</a>
<a id='line_5785'>    Set teeth on thee, let it not weary thee</a>
<a id='line_5786'>    To tell us who it is, ere it dart hence.”</a>
<a id='line_5787'></a>
<a id='line_5788'>And he to me: “That is the ancient ghost</a>
<a id='line_5789'>    Of the nefarious Myrrha, who became</a>
<a id='line_5790'>    Beyond all rightful love her father’s lover.</a>
<a id='line_5791'></a>
<a id='line_5792'>She came to sin with him after this manner,</a>
<a id='line_5793'>    By counterfeiting of another’s form;</a>
<a id='line_5794'>    As he who goeth yonder undertook,</a>
<a id='line_5795'></a>
<a id='line_5796'>That he might gain the lady of the herd,</a>
<a id='line_5797'>    To counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati,</a>
<a id='line_5798'>    Making a will and giving it due form.”</a>
<a id='line_5799'></a>
<a id='line_5800'>And after the two maniacs had passed</a>
<a id='line_5801'>    On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back</a>
<a id='line_5802'>    To look upon the other evil-born.</a>
<a id='line_5803'></a>
<a id='line_5804'>I saw one made in fashion of a lute,</a>
<a id='line_5805'>    If he had only had the groin cut off</a>
<a id='line_5806'>    Just at the point at which a man is forked.</a>
<a id='line_5807'></a>
<a id='line_5808'>The heavy dropsy, that so disproportions</a>
<a id='line_5809'>    The limbs with humours, which it ill concocts,</a>
<a id='line_5810'>    That the face corresponds not to the belly,</a>
<a id='line_5811'></a>
<a id='line_5812'>Compelled him so to hold his lips apart</a>
<a id='line_5813'>    As does the hectic, who because of thirst</a>
<a id='line_5814'>    One tow’rds the chin, the other upward turns.</a>
<a id='line_5815'></a>
<a id='line_5816'>“O ye, who without any torment are,</a>
<a id='line_5817'>    And why I know not, in the world of woe,”</a>
<a id='line_5818'>    He said to us, “behold, and be attentive</a>
<a id='line_5819'></a>
<a id='line_5820'>Unto the misery of Master Adam;</a>
<a id='line_5821'>    I had while living much of what I wished,</a>

<a id='line_5826'>    Making their channels to be cold and moist,</a>
<a id='line_5827'></a>
<a id='line_5828'>Ever before me stand, and not in vain;</a>
<a id='line_5829'>    For far more doth their image dry me up</a>
<a id='line_5830'>    Than the disease which strips my face of flesh.</a>
<a id='line_5831'></a>
<a id='line_5832'>The rigid justice that chastises me</a>
<a id='line_5833'>    Draweth occasion from the place in which</a>
<a id='line_5834'>    I sinned, to put the more my sighs in flight.</a>
<a id='line_5835'></a>
<a id='line_5836'>There is Romena, where I counterfeited</a>
<a id='line_5837'>    The currency imprinted with the Baptist,</a>
<a id='line_5838'>    For which I left my body burned above.</a>
<a id='line_5839'></a>
<a id='line_5840'>But if I here could see the tristful soul</a>
<a id='line_5841'>    Of Guido, or Alessandro, or their brother,</a>
<a id='line_5842'>    For Branda’s fount I would not give the sight.</a>
<a id='line_5843'></a>
<a id='line_5844'>One is within already, if the raving</a>
<a id='line_5845'>    Shades that are going round about speak truth;</a>
<a id='line_5846'>    But what avails it me, whose limbs are tied?</a>
<a id='line_5847'></a>
<a id='line_5848'>If I were only still so light, that in</a>
<a id='line_5849'>    A hundred years I could advance one inch,</a>
<a id='line_5850'>    I had already started on the way,</a>
<a id='line_5851'></a>
<a id='line_5852'>Seeking him out among this squalid folk,</a>
<a id='line_5853'>    Although the circuit be eleven miles,</a>
<a id='line_5854'>    And be not less than half a mile across.</a>
<a id='line_5855'></a>
<a id='line_5856'>For them am I in such a family;</a>
<a id='line_5857'>    They did induce me into coining florins,</a>
<a id='line_5858'>    Which had three carats of impurity.”</a>
<a id='line_5859'></a>
<a id='line_5860'>And I to him: “Who are the two poor wretches</a>
<a id='line_5861'>    That smoke like unto a wet hand in winter,</a>
<a id='line_5862'>    Lying there close upon thy right-hand confines?”</a>
<a id='line_5863'></a>
<a id='line_5864'>“I found them here,” replied he, “when I rained</a>
<a id='line_5865'>    Into this chasm, and since they have not turned,</a>
<a id='line_5866'>    Nor do I think they will for evermore.</a>
<a id='line_5867'></a>
<a id='line_5868'>One the false woman is who accused Joseph,</a>
<a id='line_5869'>    The other the false Sinon, Greek of Troy;</a>
<a id='line_5870'>    From acute fever they send forth such reek.”</a>
<a id='line_5871'></a>
<a id='line_5872'>And one of them, who felt himself annoyed</a>
<a id='line_5873'>    At being, peradventure, named so darkly,</a>
<a id='line_5874'>    Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch.</a>
<a id='line_5875'></a>
<a id='line_5876'>It gave a sound, as if it were a drum;</a>
<a id='line_5877'>    And Master Adam smote him in the face,</a>
<a id='line_5878'>    With arm that did not seem to be less hard,</a>
<a id='line_5879'></a>
<a id='line_5880'>Saying to him: “Although be taken from me</a>
<a id='line_5881'>    All motion, for my limbs that heavy are,</a>
<a id='line_5882'>    I have an arm unfettered for such need.”</a>
<a id='line_5883'></a>
<a id='line_5884'>Whereat he answer made: “When thou didst go</a>
<a id='line_5885'>    Unto the fire, thou hadst it not so ready:</a>
<a id='line_5886'>    But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining.”</a>
<a id='line_5887'></a>
<a id='line_5888'>The dropsical: “Thou sayest true in that;</a>
<a id='line_5889'>    But thou wast not so true a witness there,</a>
<a id='line_5890'>    Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy.”</a>
<a id='line_5891'></a>
<a id='line_5892'>“If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,”</a>
<a id='line_5893'>    Said Sinon; “and for one fault I am here,</a>
<a id='line_5894'>    And thou for more than any other demon.”</a>
<a id='line_5895'></a>
<a id='line_5896'>“Remember, perjurer, about the horse,”</a>
<a id='line_5897'>    He made reply who had the swollen belly,</a>
<a id='line_5898'>    “And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it.”</a>
<a id='line_5899'></a>
<a id='line_5900'>“Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks</a>
<a id='line_5901'>    Thy tongue,” the Greek said, “and the putrid water</a>
<a id='line_5902'>    That hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes.”</a>
<a id='line_5903'></a>
<a id='line_5904'>Then the false-coiner: “So is gaping wide</a>
<a id='line_5905'>    Thy mouth for speaking evil, as ’tis wont;</a>
<a id='line_5906'>    Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me</a>
<a id='line_5907'></a>
<a id='line_5908'>Thou hast the burning and the head that aches,</a>
<a id='line_5909'>    And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus</a>
<a id='line_5910'>    Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee.”</a>
<a id='line_5911'></a>
<a id='line_5912'>In listening to them was I wholly fixed,</a>
<a id='line_5913'>    When said the Master to me: “Now just look,</a>
<a id='line_5914'>    For little wants it that I quarrel with thee.”</a>
<a id='line_5915'></a>
<a id='line_5916'>When him I heard in anger speak to me,</a>
<a id='line_5917'>    I turned me round towards him with such shame</a>
<a id='line_5918'>    That still it eddies through my memory.</a>
<a id='line_5919'></a>
<a id='line_5920'>And as he is who dreams of his own harm,</a>
<a id='line_5921'>    Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream,</a>
<a id='line_5922'>    So that he craves what is, as if it were not;</a>
<a id='line_5923'></a>
<a id='line_5924'>Such I became, not having power to speak,</a>
<a id='line_5925'>    For to excuse myself I wished, and still</a>
<a id='line_5926'>    Excused myself, and did not think I did it.</a>
<a id='line_5927'></a>
<a id='line_5928'>“Less shame doth wash away a greater fault,”</a>
<a id='line_5929'>    The Master said, “than this of thine has been;</a>
<a id='line_5930'>    Therefore thyself disburden of all sadness,</a>
<a id='line_5931'></a>
<a id='line_5932'>And make account that I am aye beside thee,</a>
<a id='line_5933'>    If e’er it come to pass that fortune bring thee</a>
<a id='line_5934'>    Where there are people in a like dispute;</a>
<a id='line_5935'></a>
<a id='line_5936'>For a base wish it is to wish to hear it.”</a>

<a id='line_5944'>One and the selfsame tongue first wounded me,</a>

<a id='line_5946'>    And then held out to me the medicine;</a>
<a id='line_5947'></a>
<a id='line_5948'>Thus do I hear that once Achilles’ spear,</a>

<a id='line_5951'></a>
<a id='line_5952'>We turned our backs upon the wretched valley,</a>
<a id='line_5953'>    Upon the bank that girds it round about,</a>
<a id='line_5954'>    Going across it without any speech.</a>
<a id='line_5955'></a>
<a id='line_5956'>There it was less than night, and less than day,</a>
<a id='line_5957'>    So that my sight went little in advance;</a>
<a id='line_5958'>    But I could hear the blare of a loud horn,</a>
<a id='line_5959'></a>
<a id='line_5960'>So loud it would have made each thunder faint,</a>
<a id='line_5961'>    Which, counter to it following its way,</a>
<a id='line_5962'>    Mine eyes directed wholly to one place.</a>
<a id='line_5963'></a>
<a id='line_5964'>After the dolorous discomfiture</a>
<a id='line_5965'>    When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost,</a>
<a id='line_5966'>    So terribly Orlando sounded not.</a>
<a id='line_5967'></a>
<a id='line_5968'>Short while my head turned thitherward I held</a>
<a id='line_5969'>    When many lofty towers I seemed to see,</a>
<a id='line_5970'>    Whereat I: “Master, say, what town is this?”</a>
<a id='line_5971'></a>
<a id='line_5972'>And he to me: “Because thou peerest forth</a>
<a id='line_5973'>    Athwart the darkness at too great a distance,</a>
<a id='line_5974'>    It happens that thou errest in thy fancy.</a>
<a id='line_5975'></a>
<a id='line_5976'>Well shalt thou see, if thou arrivest there,</a>
<a id='line_5977'>    How much the sense deceives itself by distance;</a>
<a id='line_5978'>    Therefore a little faster spur thee on.”</a>
<a id='line_5979'></a>
<a id='line_5980'>Then tenderly he took me by the hand,</a>
<a id='line_5981'>    And said: “Before we farther have advanced,</a>
<a id='line_5982'>    That the reality may seem to thee</a>
<a id='line_5983'></a>
<a id='line_5984'>Less strange, know that these are not towers, but giants,</a>
<a id='line_5985'>    And they are in the well, around the bank,</a>
<a id='line_5986'>    From navel downward, one and all of them.”</a>
<a id='line_5987'></a>
<a id='line_5988'>As, when the fog is vanishing away,</a>
<a id='line_5989'>    Little by little doth the sight refigure</a>
<a id='line_5990'>    Whate’er the mist that crowds the air conceals,</a>
<a id='line_5991'></a>
<a id='line_5992'>So, piercing through the dense and darksome air,</a>
<a id='line_5993'>    More and more near approaching tow’rd the verge,</a>
<a id='line_5994'>    My error fled, and fear came over me;</a>
<a id='line_5995'></a>
<a id='line_5996'>Because as on its circular parapets</a>
<a id='line_5997'>    Montereggione crowns itself with towers,</a>
<a id='line_5998'>    E’en thus the margin which surrounds the well</a>
<a id='line_5999'></a>
<a id='line_6000'>With one half of their bodies turreted</a>
<a id='line_6001'>    The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces</a>
<a id='line_6002'>    E’en now from out the heavens when he thunders.</a>
<a id='line_6003'></a>
<a id='line_6004'>And I of one already saw the face,</a>
<a id='line_6005'>    Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,</a>
<a id='line_6006'>    And down along his sides both of the arms.</a>
<a id='line_6007'></a>
<a id='line_6008'>Certainly Nature, when she left the making</a>
<a id='line_6009'>    Of animals like these, did well indeed,</a>
<a id='line_6010'>    By taking such executors from Mars;</a>
<a id='line_6011'></a>
<a id='line_6012'>And if of elephants and whales she doth not</a>
<a id='line_6013'>    Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly</a>
<a id='line_6014'>    More just and more discreet will hold her for it;</a>
<a id='line_6015'></a>
<a id='line_6016'>For where the argument of intellect</a>
<a id='line_6017'>    Is added unto evil will and power,</a>
<a id='line_6018'>    No rampart can the people make against it.</a>
<a id='line_6019'></a>
<a id='line_6020'>His face appeared to me as long and large</a>
<a id='line_6021'>    As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter’s,</a>
<a id='line_6022'>    And in proportion were the other bones;</a>
<a id='line_6023'></a>
<a id='line_6024'>So that the margin, which an apron was</a>
<a id='line_6025'>    Down from the middle, showed so much of him</a>
<a id='line_6026'>    Above it, that to reach up to his hair</a>
<a id='line_6027'></a>
<a id='line_6028'>Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them;</a>
<a id='line_6029'>    For I beheld thirty great palms of him</a>
<a id='line_6030'>    Down from the place where man his mantle buckles.</a>
<a id='line_6031'></a>
<a id='line_6032'>“Raphael mai amech izabi almi,”</a>
<a id='line_6033'>    Began to clamour the ferocious mouth,</a>
<a id='line_6034'>    To which were not befitting sweeter psalms.</a>
<a id='line_6035'></a>
<a id='line_6036'>And unto him my Guide: “Soul idiotic,</a>
<a id='line_6037'>    Keep to thy horn, and vent thyself with that,</a>
<a id='line_6038'>    When wrath or other passion touches thee.</a>
<a id='line_6039'></a>
<a id='line_6040'>Search round thy neck, and thou wilt find the belt</a>
<a id='line_6041'>    Which keeps it fastened, O bewildered soul,</a>
<a id='line_6042'>    And see it, where it bars thy mighty breast.”</a>
<a id='line_6043'></a>
<a id='line_6044'>Then said to me: “He doth himself accuse;</a>
<a id='line_6045'>    This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought</a>
<a id='line_6046'>    One language in the world is not still used.</a>
<a id='line_6047'></a>
<a id='line_6048'>Here let us leave him and not speak in vain;</a>
<a id='line_6049'>    For even such to him is every language</a>
<a id='line_6050'>    As his to others, which to none is known.”</a>
<a id='line_6051'></a>
<a id='line_6052'>Therefore a longer journey did we make,</a>
<a id='line_6053'>    Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft</a>
<a id='line_6054'>    We found another far more fierce and large.</a>
<a id='line_6055'></a>
<a id='line_6056'>In binding him, who might the master be</a>
<a id='line_6057'>    I cannot say; but he had pinioned close</a>
<a id='line_6058'>    Behind the right arm, and in front the other,</a>
<a id='line_6059'></a>
<a id='line_6060'>With chains, that held him so begirt about</a>
<a id='line_6061'>    From the neck down, that on the part uncovered</a>
<a id='line_6062'>    It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.</a>
<a id='line_6063'></a>
<a id='line_6064'>“This proud one wished to make experiment</a>
<a id='line_6065'>    Of his own power against the Supreme Jove,”</a>
<a id='line_6066'>    My Leader said, “whence he has such a guerdon.</a>
<a id='line_6067'></a>
<a id='line_6068'>Ephialtes is his name; he showed great prowess.</a>
<a id='line_6069'>    What time the giants terrified the gods;</a>
<a id='line_6070'>    The arms he wielded never more he moves.”</a>
<a id='line_6071'></a>
<a id='line_6072'>And I to him: “If possible, I should wish</a>
<a id='line_6073'>    That of the measureless Briareus</a>
<a id='line_6074'>    These eyes of mine might have experience.”</a>
<a id='line_6075'></a>
<a id='line_6076'>Whence he replied: “Thou shalt behold Antaeus</a>
<a id='line_6077'>    Close by here, who can speak and is unbound,</a>
<a id='line_6078'>    Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us.</a>
<a id='line_6079'></a>
<a id='line_6080'>Much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see,</a>
<a id='line_6081'>    And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one,</a>
<a id='line_6082'>    Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious.”</a>
<a id='line_6083'></a>
<a id='line_6084'>There never was an earthquake of such might</a>
<a id='line_6085'>    That it could shake a tower so violently,</a>
<a id='line_6086'>    As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.</a>
<a id='line_6087'></a>
<a id='line_6088'>Then was I more afraid of death than ever,</a>
<a id='line_6089'>    For nothing more was needful than the fear,</a>
<a id='line_6090'>    If I had not beheld the manacles.</a>
<a id='line_6091'></a>
<a id='line_6092'>Then we proceeded farther in advance,</a>
<a id='line_6093'>    And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells</a>
<a id='line_6094'>    Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.</a>
<a id='line_6095'></a>
<a id='line_6096'>“O thou, who in the valley fortunate,</a>

<a id='line_6114'>    If to itself Grace call him not untimely.”</a>
<a id='line_6115'></a>
<a id='line_6116'>So said the Master; and in haste the other</a>
<a id='line_6117'>    His hands extended and took up my Guide,—</a>
<a id='line_6118'>    Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.</a>
<a id='line_6119'></a>
<a id='line_6120'>Virgilius, when he felt himself embraced,</a>
<a id='line_6121'>    Said unto me: “Draw nigh, that I may take thee;”</a>
<a id='line_6122'>    Then of himself and me one bundle made.</a>
<a id='line_6123'></a>
<a id='line_6124'>As seems the Carisenda, to behold</a>
<a id='line_6125'>    Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud</a>
<a id='line_6126'>    Above it so that opposite it hangs;</a>
<a id='line_6127'></a>
<a id='line_6128'>Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood</a>
<a id='line_6129'>    Watching to see him stoop, and then it was</a>
<a id='line_6130'>    I could have wished to go some other way.</a>
<a id='line_6131'></a>
<a id='line_6132'>But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up</a>
<a id='line_6133'>    Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;</a>
<a id='line_6134'>    Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,</a>
<a id='line_6135'></a>
<a id='line_6136'>But, as a mast does in a ship, uprose.</a>
<a id='line_6137'></a>
<a id='line_6138'></a>

<a id='line_6140'></a>
<a id='line_6141'>Inferno: Canto XXXII</a>
<a id='line_6142'></a>
<a id='line_6143'></a>
<a id='line_6144'>If I had rhymes both rough and stridulous,</a>
<a id='line_6145'>    As were appropriate to the dismal hole</a>
<a id='line_6146'>    Down upon which thrust all the other rocks,</a>
<a id='line_6147'></a>
<a id='line_6148'>I would press out the juice of my conception</a>
<a id='line_6149'>    More fully; but because I have them not,</a>
<a id='line_6150'>    Not without fear I bring myself to speak;</a>
<a id='line_6151'></a>
<a id='line_6152'>For ’tis no enterprise to take in jest,</a>
<a id='line_6153'>    To sketch the bottom of all the universe,</a>
<a id='line_6154'>    Nor for a tongue that cries Mamma and Babbo.</a>
<a id='line_6155'></a>
<a id='line_6156'>But may those Ladies help this verse of mine,</a>
<a id='line_6157'>    Who helped Amphion in enclosing Thebes,</a>
<a id='line_6158'>    That from the fact the word be not diverse.</a>
<a id='line_6159'></a>
<a id='line_6160'>O rabble ill-begotten above all,</a>
<a id='line_6161'>    Who’re in the place to speak of which is hard,</a>
<a id='line_6162'>    ’Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats!</a>
<a id='line_6163'></a>
<a id='line_6164'>When we were down within the darksome well,</a>
<a id='line_6165'>    Beneath the giant’s feet, but lower far,</a>
<a id='line_6166'>    And I was scanning still the lofty wall,</a>
<a id='line_6167'></a>
<a id='line_6168'>I heard it said to me: “Look how thou steppest!</a>
<a id='line_6169'>    Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet</a>
<a id='line_6170'>    The heads of the tired, miserable brothers!”</a>
<a id='line_6171'></a>
<a id='line_6172'>Whereat I turned me round, and saw before me</a>
<a id='line_6173'>    And underfoot a lake, that from the frost</a>
<a id='line_6174'>    The semblance had of glass, and not of water.</a>
<a id='line_6175'></a>
<a id='line_6176'>So thick a veil ne’er made upon its current</a>
<a id='line_6177'>    In winter-time Danube in Austria,</a>
<a id='line_6178'>    Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don,</a>
<a id='line_6179'></a>
<a id='line_6180'>As there was here; so that if Tambernich</a>
<a id='line_6181'>    Had fallen upon it, or Pietrapana,</a>
<a id='line_6182'>    E’en at the edge ’twould not have given a creak.</a>
<a id='line_6183'></a>
<a id='line_6184'>And as to croak the frog doth place himself</a>
<a id='line_6185'>    With muzzle out of water,—when is dreaming</a>
<a id='line_6186'>    Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant-girl,—</a>
<a id='line_6187'></a>
<a id='line_6188'>Livid, as far down as where shame appears,</a>
<a id='line_6189'>    Were the disconsolate shades within the ice,</a>
<a id='line_6190'>    Setting their teeth unto the note of storks.</a>
<a id='line_6191'></a>
<a id='line_6192'>Each one his countenance held downward bent;</a>
<a id='line_6193'>    From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart</a>
<a id='line_6194'>    Among them witness of itself procures.</a>
<a id='line_6195'></a>
<a id='line_6196'>When round about me somewhat I had looked,</a>
<a id='line_6197'>    I downward turned me, and saw two so close,</a>
<a id='line_6198'>    The hair upon their heads together mingled.</a>
<a id='line_6199'></a>
<a id='line_6200'>“Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,”</a>
<a id='line_6201'>    I said, “who are you;” and they bent their necks,</a>
<a id='line_6202'>    And when to me their faces they had lifted,</a>
<a id='line_6203'></a>
<a id='line_6204'>Their eyes, which first were only moist within,</a>
<a id='line_6205'>    Gushed o’er the eyelids, and the frost congealed</a>
<a id='line_6206'>    The tears between, and locked them up again.</a>
<a id='line_6207'></a>
<a id='line_6208'>Clamp never bound together wood with wood</a>
<a id='line_6209'>    So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats,</a>
<a id='line_6210'>    Butted together, so much wrath o’ercame them.</a>
<a id='line_6211'></a>
<a id='line_6212'>And one, who had by reason of the cold</a>
<a id='line_6213'>    Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward,</a>
<a id='line_6214'>    Said: “Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?</a>
<a id='line_6215'></a>
<a id='line_6216'>If thou desire to know who these two are,</a>
<a id='line_6217'>    The valley whence Bisenzio descends</a>
<a id='line_6218'>    Belonged to them and to their father Albert.</a>
<a id='line_6219'></a>
<a id='line_6220'>They from one body came, and all Caina</a>
<a id='line_6221'>    Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade</a>
<a id='line_6222'>    More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;</a>
<a id='line_6223'></a>
<a id='line_6224'>Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow</a>
<a id='line_6225'>    At one and the same blow by Arthur’s hand;</a>
<a id='line_6226'>    Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers</a>
<a id='line_6227'></a>
<a id='line_6228'>So with his head I see no farther forward,</a>
<a id='line_6229'>    And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni;</a>
<a id='line_6230'>    Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan.</a>
<a id='line_6231'></a>
<a id='line_6232'>And that thou put me not to further speech,</a>
<a id='line_6233'>    Know that I Camicion de’ Pazzi was,</a>
<a id='line_6234'>    And wait Carlino to exonerate me.”</a>
<a id='line_6235'></a>
<a id='line_6236'>Then I beheld a thousand faces, made</a>
<a id='line_6237'>    Purple with cold; whence o’er me comes a shudder,</a>
<a id='line_6238'>    And evermore will come, at frozen ponds.</a>
<a id='line_6239'></a>
<a id='line_6240'>And while we were advancing tow’rds the middle,</a>
<a id='line_6241'>    Where everything of weight unites together,</a>
<a id='line_6242'>    And I was shivering in the eternal shade,</a>
<a id='line_6243'></a>
<a id='line_6244'>Whether ’twere will, or destiny, or chance,</a>
<a id='line_6245'>    I know not; but in walking ’mong the heads</a>
<a id='line_6246'>    I struck my foot hard in the face of one.</a>
<a id='line_6247'></a>
<a id='line_6248'>Weeping he growled: “Why dost thou trample me?</a>
<a id='line_6249'>    Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance</a>
<a id='line_6250'>    of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?”</a>
<a id='line_6251'></a>
<a id='line_6252'>And I: “My Master, now wait here for me,</a>
<a id='line_6253'>    That I through him may issue from a doubt;</a>
<a id='line_6254'>    Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish.”</a>
<a id='line_6255'></a>
<a id='line_6256'>The Leader stopped; and to that one I said</a>
<a id='line_6257'>    Who was blaspheming vehemently still:</a>
<a id='line_6258'>    “Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?”</a>
<a id='line_6259'></a>
<a id='line_6260'>“Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora</a>
<a id='line_6261'>    Smiting,” replied he, “other people’s cheeks,</a>
<a id='line_6262'>    So that, if thou wert living, ’twere too much?”</a>
<a id='line_6263'></a>
<a id='line_6264'>“Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,”</a>
<a id='line_6265'>    Was my response, “if thou demandest fame,</a>
<a id='line_6266'>    That ’mid the other notes thy name I place.”</a>
<a id='line_6267'></a>
<a id='line_6268'>And he to me: “For the reverse I long;</a>
<a id='line_6269'>    Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble;</a>
<a id='line_6270'>    For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow.”</a>
<a id='line_6271'></a>
<a id='line_6272'>Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him,</a>
<a id='line_6273'>    And said: “It must needs be thou name thyself,</a>
<a id='line_6274'>    Or not a hair remain upon thee here.”</a>
<a id='line_6275'></a>
<a id='line_6276'>Whence he to me: “Though thou strip off my hair,</a>
<a id='line_6277'>    I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee,</a>
<a id='line_6278'>    If on my head a thousand times thou fall.”</a>
<a id='line_6279'></a>
<a id='line_6280'>I had his hair in hand already twisted,</a>
<a id='line_6281'>    And more than one shock of it had pulled out,</a>
<a id='line_6282'>    He barking, with his eyes held firmly down,</a>
<a id='line_6283'></a>
<a id='line_6284'>When cried another: “What doth ail thee, Bocca?</a>
<a id='line_6285'>    Is’t not enough to clatter with thy jaws,</a>
<a id='line_6286'>    But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?”</a>
<a id='line_6287'></a>
<a id='line_6288'>“Now,” said I, “I care not to have thee speak,</a>
<a id='line_6289'>    Accursed traitor; for unto thy shame</a>
<a id='line_6290'>    I will report of thee veracious news.”</a>
<a id='line_6291'></a>
<a id='line_6292'>“Begone,” replied he, “and tell what thou wilt,</a>
<a id='line_6293'>    But be not silent, if thou issue hence,</a>
<a id='line_6294'>    Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt;</a>
<a id='line_6295'></a>
<a id='line_6296'>He weepeth here the silver of the French;</a>
<a id='line_6297'>    ‘I saw,’ thus canst thou phrase it, ‘him of Duera</a>
<a id='line_6298'>    There where the sinners stand out in the cold.’</a>
<a id='line_6299'></a>
<a id='line_6300'>If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there,</a>
<a id='line_6301'>    Thou hast beside thee him of Beccaria,</a>
<a id='line_6302'>    Of whom the gorget Florence slit asunder;</a>
<a id='line_6303'></a>
<a id='line_6304'>Gianni del Soldanier, I think, may be</a>
<a id='line_6305'>    Yonder with Ganellon, and Tebaldello</a>
<a id='line_6306'>    Who oped Faenza when the people slep.”</a>
<a id='line_6307'></a>
<a id='line_6308'>Already we had gone away from him,</a>
<a id='line_6309'>    When I beheld two frozen in one hole,</a>
<a id='line_6310'>    So that one head a hood was to the other;</a>
<a id='line_6311'></a>
<a id='line_6312'>And even as bread through hunger is devoured,</a>
<a id='line_6313'>    The uppermost on the other set his teeth,</a>
<a id='line_6314'>    There where the brain is to the nape united.</a>
<a id='line_6315'></a>
<a id='line_6316'>Not in another fashion Tydeus gnawed</a>
<a id='line_6317'>    The temples of Menalippus in disdain,</a>
<a id='line_6318'>    Than that one did the skull and the other things.</a>
<a id='line_6319'></a>
<a id='line_6320'>“O thou, who showest by such bestial sign</a>
<a id='line_6321'>    Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating,</a>
<a id='line_6322'>    Tell me the wherefore,” said I, “with this compact,</a>
<a id='line_6323'></a>
<a id='line_6324'>That if thou rightfully of him complain,</a>
<a id='line_6325'>    In knowing who ye are, and his transgression,</a>
<a id='line_6326'>    I in the world above repay thee for it,</a>
<a id='line_6327'></a>
<a id='line_6328'>If that wherewith I speak be not dried up.”</a>
<a id='line_6329'></a>
<a id='line_6330'></a>
<a id='line_6331'></a>
<a id='line_6332'></a>
<a id='line_6333'>Inferno: Canto XXXIII</a>
<a id='line_6334'></a>
<a id='line_6335'></a>
<a id='line_6336'>His mouth uplifted from his grim repast,</a>
<a id='line_6337'>    That sinner, wiping it upon the hair</a>
<a id='line_6338'>    Of the same head that he behind had wasted.</a>
<a id='line_6339'></a>
<a id='line_6340'>Then he began: “Thou wilt that I renew</a>
<a id='line_6341'>    The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already</a>
<a id='line_6342'>    To think of only, ere I speak of it;</a>
<a id='line_6343'></a>
<a id='line_6344'>But if my words be seed that may bear fruit</a>
<a id='line_6345'>    Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw,</a>
<a id='line_6346'>    Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together.</a>
<a id='line_6347'></a>
<a id='line_6348'>I know not who thou art, nor by what mode</a>
<a id='line_6349'>    Thou hast come down here; but a Florentine</a>
<a id='line_6350'>    Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee.</a>
<a id='line_6351'></a>
<a id='line_6352'>Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino,</a>
<a id='line_6353'>    And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop;</a>
<a id='line_6354'>    Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour.</a>
<a id='line_6355'></a>
<a id='line_6356'>That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,</a>
<a id='line_6357'>    Trusting in him I was made prisoner,</a>
<a id='line_6358'>    And after put to death, I need not say;</a>
<a id='line_6359'></a>
<a id='line_6360'> But ne’ertheless what thou canst not have heard,</a>
<a id='line_6361'>    That is to say, how cruel was my death,</a>
<a id='line_6362'>    Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me.</a>
<a id='line_6363'></a>
<a id='line_6364'>A narrow perforation in the mew,</a>
<a id='line_6365'>    Which bears because of me the title of Famine,</a>
<a id='line_6366'>    And in which others still must be locked up,</a>
<a id='line_6367'></a>
<a id='line_6368'>Had shown me through its opening many moons</a>
<a id='line_6369'>    Already, when I dreamed the evil dream</a>
<a id='line_6370'>    Which of the future rent for me the veil.</a>
<a id='line_6371'></a>
<a id='line_6372'>This one appeared to me as lord and master,</a>
<a id='line_6373'>    Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain</a>
<a id='line_6374'>    For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.</a>
<a id='line_6375'></a>
<a id='line_6376'>With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,</a>
<a id='line_6377'>    Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi</a>
<a id='line_6378'>    He had sent out before him to the front.</a>
<a id='line_6379'></a>
<a id='line_6380'>After brief course seemed unto me forespent</a>
<a id='line_6381'>    The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes</a>
<a id='line_6382'>    It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.</a>
<a id='line_6383'></a>
<a id='line_6384'>When I before the morrow was awake,</a>
<a id='line_6385'>    Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons</a>
<a id='line_6386'>    Who with me were, and asking after bread.</a>
<a id='line_6387'></a>
<a id='line_6388'>Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,</a>
<a id='line_6389'>    Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,</a>
<a id='line_6390'>    And weep’st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?</a>
<a id='line_6391'></a>
<a id='line_6392'>They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh</a>
<a id='line_6393'>    At which our food used to be brought to us,</a>
<a id='line_6394'>    And through his dream was each one apprehensive;</a>
<a id='line_6395'></a>
<a id='line_6396'>And I heard locking up the under door</a>
<a id='line_6397'>    Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word</a>
<a id='line_6398'>    I gazed into the faces of my sons.</a>
<a id='line_6399'></a>
<a id='line_6400'>I wept not, I within so turned to stone;</a>
<a id='line_6401'>    They wept; and darling little Anselm mine</a>
<a id='line_6402'>    Said: ‘Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?’</a>
<a id='line_6403'></a>
<a id='line_6404'>Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made</a>
<a id='line_6405'>    All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter,</a>
<a id='line_6406'>    Until another sun rose on the world.</a>
<a id='line_6407'></a>
<a id='line_6408'>As now a little glimmer made its way</a>
<a id='line_6409'>    Into the dolorous prison, and I saw</a>
<a id='line_6410'>    Upon four faces my own very aspect,</a>
<a id='line_6411'></a>
<a id='line_6412'>Both of my hands in agony I bit;</a>
<a id='line_6413'>    And, thinking that I did it from desire</a>
<a id='line_6414'>    Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,</a>
<a id='line_6415'></a>
<a id='line_6416'>And said they: ‘Father, much less pain ’twill give us</a>
<a id='line_6417'>    If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us</a>
<a id='line_6418'>    With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.’</a>
<a id='line_6419'></a>
<a id='line_6420'>I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.</a>
<a id='line_6421'>    That day we all were silent, and the next.</a>
<a id='line_6422'>    Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?</a>
<a id='line_6423'></a>
<a id='line_6424'>When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo</a>
<a id='line_6425'>    Threw himself down outstretched before my feet,</a>
<a id='line_6426'>    Saying, ‘My father, why dost thou not help me?’</a>
<a id='line_6427'></a>
<a id='line_6428'>And there he died; and, as thou seest me,</a>
<a id='line_6429'>    I saw the three fall, one by one, between</a>
<a id='line_6430'>    The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me,</a>
<a id='line_6431'></a>
<a id='line_6432'>Already blind, to groping over each,</a>
<a id='line_6433'>    And three days called them after they were dead;</a>
<a id='line_6434'>    Then hunger did what sorrow could not do.”</a>
<a id='line_6435'></a>
<a id='line_6436'>When he had said this, with his eyes distorted,</a>
<a id='line_6437'>    The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,</a>
<a id='line_6438'>    Which, as a dog’s, upon the bone were strong.</a>
<a id='line_6439'></a>
<a id='line_6440'>Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people</a>
<a id='line_6441'>    Of the fair land there where the ‘Si’ doth sound,</a>
<a id='line_6442'>    Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are,</a>
<a id='line_6443'></a>
<a id='line_6444'>Let the Capraia and Gorgona move,</a>
<a id='line_6445'>    And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno</a>
<a id='line_6446'>    That every person in thee it may drown!</a>
<a id='line_6447'></a>
<a id='line_6448'>For if Count Ugolino had the fame</a>
<a id='line_6449'>    Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,</a>
<a id='line_6450'>    Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.</a>
<a id='line_6451'></a>
<a id='line_6452'>Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!</a>
<a id='line_6453'>    Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,</a>
<a id='line_6454'>    And the other two my song doth name above!</a>
<a id='line_6455'></a>
<a id='line_6456'>We passed still farther onward, where the ice</a>
<a id='line_6457'>    Another people ruggedly enswathes,</a>
<a id='line_6458'>    Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.</a>
<a id='line_6459'></a>
<a id='line_6460'>Weeping itself there does not let them weep,</a>
<a id='line_6461'>    And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes</a>
<a id='line_6462'>    Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;</a>
<a id='line_6463'></a>
<a id='line_6464'>Because the earliest tears a cluster form,</a>
<a id='line_6465'>    And, in the manner of a crystal visor,</a>
<a id='line_6466'>    Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.</a>
<a id='line_6467'></a>
<a id='line_6468'>And notwithstanding that, as in a callus,</a>
<a id='line_6469'>    Because of cold all sensibility</a>
<a id='line_6470'>    Its station had abandoned in my face,</a>
<a id='line_6471'></a>
<a id='line_6472'>Still it appeared to me I felt some wind;</a>
<a id='line_6473'>    Whence I: “My Master, who sets this in motion?</a>
<a id='line_6474'>    Is not below here every vapour quenched?”</a>
<a id='line_6475'></a>
<a id='line_6476'>Whence he to me: “Full soon shalt thou be where</a>
<a id='line_6477'>    Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this,</a>
<a id='line_6478'>    Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast.”</a>
<a id='line_6479'></a>
<a id='line_6480'>And one of the wretches of the frozen crust</a>
<a id='line_6481'>    Cried out to us: “O souls so merciless</a>
<a id='line_6482'>    That the last post is given unto you,</a>
<a id='line_6483'></a>
<a id='line_6484'>Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I</a>
<a id='line_6485'>    May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart</a>
<a id='line_6486'>    A little, e’er the weeping recongeal.”</a>
<a id='line_6487'></a>
<a id='line_6488'>Whence I to him: “If thou wouldst have me help thee</a>
<a id='line_6489'>    Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,</a>
<a id='line_6490'>    May I go to the bottom of the ice.”</a>
<a id='line_6491'></a>
<a id='line_6492'>Then he replied: “I am Friar Alberigo;</a>
<a id='line_6493'>    He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,</a>
<a id='line_6494'>    Who here a date am getting for my fig.”</a>
<a id='line_6495'></a>
<a id='line_6496'>“O,” said I to him, “now art thou, too, dead?”</a>
<a id='line_6497'>    And he to me: “How may my body fare</a>
<a id='line_6498'>    Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.</a>
<a id='line_6499'></a>
<a id='line_6500'>Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea,</a>
<a id='line_6501'>    That oftentimes the soul descendeth here</a>
<a id='line_6502'>    Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it.</a>
<a id='line_6503'></a>
<a id='line_6504'>And, that thou mayest more willingly remove</a>
<a id='line_6505'>    From off my countenance these glassy tears,</a>
<a id='line_6506'>    Know that as soon as any soul betrays</a>

<a id='line_6511'></a>
<a id='line_6512'>Itself down rushes into such a cistern;</a>
<a id='line_6513'>    And still perchance above appears the body</a>
<a id='line_6514'>    Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me.</a>
<a id='line_6515'></a>
<a id='line_6516'>This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down;</a>
<a id='line_6517'>    It is Ser Branca d’ Oria, and many years</a>
<a id='line_6518'>    Have passed away since he was thus locked up.”</a>
<a id='line_6519'></a>
<a id='line_6520'>“I think,” said I to him, “thou dost deceive me;</a>
<a id='line_6521'>    For Branca d’ Oria is not dead as yet,</a>
<a id='line_6522'>    And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes.”</a>
<a id='line_6523'></a>
<a id='line_6524'>“In moat above,” said he, “of Malebranche,</a>
<a id='line_6525'>    There where is boiling the tenacious pitch,</a>
<a id='line_6526'>    As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived,</a>
<a id='line_6527'></a>
<a id='line_6528'>When this one left a devil in his stead</a>
<a id='line_6529'>    In his own body and one near of kin,</a>
<a id='line_6530'>    Who made together with him the betrayal.</a>
<a id='line_6531'></a>
<a id='line_6532'>But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith,</a>
<a id='line_6533'>    Open mine eyes;”—and open them I did not,</a>
<a id='line_6534'>    And to be rude to him was courtesy.</a>
<a id='line_6535'></a>
<a id='line_6536'>Ah, Genoese! ye men at variance</a>

<a id='line_6539'></a>
<a id='line_6540'>For with the vilest spirit of Romagna</a>
<a id='line_6541'>    I found of you one such, who for his deeds</a>

<a id='line_6559'></a>
<a id='line_6560'>Methought that such a building then I saw;</a>

<a id='line_6563'></a>
<a id='line_6564'>Now was I, and with fear in verse I put it,</a>

<a id='line_6583'></a>

<a id='line_6585'>    Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,</a>
<a id='line_6586'>    What I became, being of both deprived.</a>
<a id='line_6587'></a>
<a id='line_6588'>The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous</a>
<a id='line_6589'>    From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;</a>
<a id='line_6590'>    And better with a giant I compare</a>
<a id='line_6591'></a>
<a id='line_6592'>Than do the giants with those arms of his;</a>
<a id='line_6593'>    Consider now how great must be that whole,</a>
<a id='line_6594'>    Which unto such a part conforms itself.</a>
<a id='line_6595'></a>
<a id='line_6596'>Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,</a>
<a id='line_6597'>    And lifted up his brow against his Maker,</a>
<a id='line_6598'>    Well may proceed from him all tribulation.</a>
<a id='line_6599'></a>
<a id='line_6600'>O, what a marvel it appeared to me,</a>
<a id='line_6601'>    When I beheld three faces on his head!</a>
<a id='line_6602'>    The one in front, and that vermilion was;</a>
<a id='line_6603'></a>
<a id='line_6604'>Two were the others, that were joined with this</a>
<a id='line_6605'>    Above the middle part of either shoulder,</a>
<a id='line_6606'>    And they were joined together at the crest;</a>
<a id='line_6607'></a>
<a id='line_6608'>And the right-hand one seemed ’twixt white and yellow;</a>
<a id='line_6609'>    The left was such to look upon as those</a>
<a id='line_6610'>    Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.</a>
<a id='line_6611'></a>
<a id='line_6612'>Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,</a>
<a id='line_6613'>    Such as befitting were so great a bird;</a>
<a id='line_6614'>    Sails of the sea I never saw so large.</a>
<a id='line_6615'></a>
<a id='line_6616'> No feathers had they, but as of a bat</a>
<a id='line_6617'>    Their fashion was; and he was waving them,</a>
<a id='line_6618'>    So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.</a>
<a id='line_6619'></a>
<a id='line_6620'>Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.</a>
<a id='line_6621'>    With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins</a>
<a id='line_6622'>    Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.</a>
<a id='line_6623'></a>
<a id='line_6624'>At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching</a>
<a id='line_6625'>    A sinner, in the manner of a brake,</a>
<a id='line_6626'>    So that he three of them tormented thus.</a>
<a id='line_6627'></a>
<a id='line_6628'>To him in front the biting was as naught</a>
<a id='line_6629'>    Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine</a>
<a id='line_6630'>    Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.</a>
<a id='line_6631'></a>
<a id='line_6632'>“That soul up there which has the greatest pain,”</a>
<a id='line_6633'>    The Master said, “is Judas Iscariot;</a>
<a id='line_6634'>    With head inside, he plies his legs without.</a>
<a id='line_6635'></a>
<a id='line_6636'>Of the two others, who head downward are,</a>
<a id='line_6637'>    The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;</a>
<a id='line_6638'>    See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word.</a>
<a id='line_6639'></a>
<a id='line_6640'>And the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius.</a>
<a id='line_6641'>    But night is reascending, and ’tis time</a>
<a id='line_6642'>    That we depart, for we have seen the whole.”</a>
<a id='line_6643'></a>
<a id='line_6644'>As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,</a>
<a id='line_6645'>    And he the vantage seized of time and place,</a>
<a id='line_6646'>    And when the wings were opened wide apart,</a>
<a id='line_6647'></a>
<a id='line_6648'>He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;</a>
<a id='line_6649'>    From fell to fell descended downward then</a>
<a id='line_6650'>    Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.</a>
<a id='line_6651'></a>
<a id='line_6652'>When we were come to where the thigh revolves</a>
<a id='line_6653'>    Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,</a>
<a id='line_6654'>    The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath,</a>
<a id='line_6655'></a>
<a id='line_6656'>Turned round his head where he had had his legs,</a>
<a id='line_6657'>    And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,</a>
<a id='line_6658'>    So that to Hell I thought we were returning.</a>
<a id='line_6659'></a>
<a id='line_6660'>“Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,”</a>
<a id='line_6661'>    The Master said, panting as one fatigued,</a>
<a id='line_6662'>    “Must we perforce depart from so much evil.”</a>
<a id='line_6663'></a>
<a id='line_6664'>Then through the opening of a rock he issued,</a>
<a id='line_6665'>    And down upon the margin seated me;</a>
<a id='line_6666'>    Then tow’rds me he outstretched his wary step.</a>
<a id='line_6667'></a>
<a id='line_6668'>I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see</a>
<a id='line_6669'>    Lucifer in the same way I had left him;</a>
<a id='line_6670'>    And I beheld him upward hold his legs.</a>
<a id='line_6671'></a>
<a id='line_6672'>And if I then became disquieted,</a>
<a id='line_6673'>    Let stolid people think who do not see</a>
<a id='line_6674'>    What the point is beyond which I had passed.</a>
<a id='line_6675'></a>
<a id='line_6676'>“Rise up,” the Master said, “upon thy feet;</a>
<a id='line_6677'>    The way is long, and difficult the road,</a>
<a id='line_6678'>    And now the sun to middle-tierce returns.”</a>
<a id='line_6679'></a>
<a id='line_6680'>It was not any palace corridor</a>
<a id='line_6681'>    There where we were, but dungeon natural,</a>
<a id='line_6682'>    With floor uneven and unease of light.</a>
<a id='line_6683'></a>
<a id='line_6684'>“Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,</a>
<a id='line_6685'>    My Master,” said I when I had arisen,</a>
<a id='line_6686'>    “To draw me from an error speak a little;</a>
<a id='line_6687'></a>
<a id='line_6688'>Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed</a>
<a id='line_6689'>    Thus upside down? and how in such short time</a>
<a id='line_6690'>    From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?”</a>
<a id='line_6691'></a>
<a id='line_6692'>And he to me: “Thou still imaginest</a>
<a id='line_6693'>    Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped</a>
<a id='line_6694'>    The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.</a>
<a id='line_6695'></a>
<a id='line_6696'>That side thou wast, so long as I descended;</a>
<a id='line_6697'>    When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point</a>
<a id='line_6698'>    To which things heavy draw from every side,</a>
<a id='line_6699'></a>
<a id='line_6700'>And now beneath the hemisphere art come</a>

<a id='line_6703'></a>
<a id='line_6704'>The Man who without sin was born and lived.</a>
<a id='line_6705'>    Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere</a>
<a id='line_6706'>    Which makes the other face of the Judecca.</a>
<a id='line_6707'></a>
<a id='line_6708'>Here it is morn when it is evening there;</a>
<a id='line_6709'>    And he who with his hair a stairway made us</a>
<a id='line_6710'>    Still fixed remaineth as he was before.</a>
<a id='line_6711'></a>
<a id='line_6712'>Upon this side he fell down out of heaven;</a>
<a id='line_6713'>    And all the land, that whilom here emerged,</a>
<a id='line_6714'>    For fear of him made of the sea a veil,</a>
<a id='line_6715'></a>
<a id='line_6716'>And came to our hemisphere; and peradventure</a>
<a id='line_6717'>    To flee from him, what on this side appears</a>
<a id='line_6718'>    Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled.”</a>
<a id='line_6719'></a>
<a id='line_6720'>A place there is below, from Beelzebub</a>
<a id='line_6721'>    As far receding as the tomb extends,</a>
<a id='line_6722'>    Which not by sight is known, but by the sound</a>
<a id='line_6723'></a>
<a id='line_6724'>Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth</a>
<a id='line_6725'>    Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed</a>
<a id='line_6726'>    With course that winds about and slightly falls.</a>
<a id='line_6727'></a>
<a id='line_6728'>The Guide and I into that hidden road</a>
<a id='line_6729'>    Now entered, to return to the bright world;</a>

<a id='line_6731'></a>
<a id='line_6732'>We mounted up, he first and I the second,</a>

<a id='line_6793'>A long beard and with white hair intermingled</a>
<a id='line_6794'>    He wore, in semblance like unto the tresses,</a>
<a id='line_6795'>    Of which a double list fell on his breast.</a>
<a id='line_6796'></a>
<a id='line_6797'>The rays of the four consecrated stars</a>
<a id='line_6798'>    Did so adorn his countenance with light,</a>
<a id='line_6799'>    That him I saw as were the sun before him.</a>
<a id='line_6800'></a>
<a id='line_6801'>“Who are you? ye who, counter the blind river,</a>
<a id='line_6802'>    Have fled away from the eternal prison?”</a>
<a id='line_6803'>    Moving those venerable plumes, he said:</a>
<a id='line_6804'></a>
<a id='line_6805'>“Who guided you? or who has been your lamp</a>
<a id='line_6806'>    In issuing forth out of the night profound,</a>
<a id='line_6807'>    That ever black makes the infernal valley?</a>
<a id='line_6808'></a>
<a id='line_6809'>The laws of the abyss, are they thus broken?</a>
<a id='line_6810'>    Or is there changed in heaven some council new,</a>
<a id='line_6811'>    That being damned ye come unto my crags?”</a>
<a id='line_6812'></a>
<a id='line_6813'>Then did my Leader lay his grasp upon me,</a>
<a id='line_6814'>    And with his words, and with his hands and signs,</a>
<a id='line_6815'>    Reverent he made in me my knees and brow;</a>
<a id='line_6816'></a>
<a id='line_6817'>Then answered him: “I came not of myself;</a>
<a id='line_6818'>    A Lady from Heaven descended, at whose prayers</a>
<a id='line_6819'>    I aided this one with my company.</a>
<a id='line_6820'></a>
<a id='line_6821'>But since it is thy will more be unfolded</a>
<a id='line_6822'>    Of our condition, how it truly is,</a>
<a id='line_6823'>    Mine cannot be that this should be denied thee.</a>
<a id='line_6824'></a>
<a id='line_6825'>This one has never his last evening seen,</a>
<a id='line_6826'>    But by his folly was so near to it</a>
<a id='line_6827'>    That very little time was there to turn.</a>
<a id='line_6828'></a>
<a id='line_6829'>As I have said, I unto him was sent</a>
<a id='line_6830'>    To rescue him, and other way was none</a>
<a id='line_6831'>    Than this to which I have myself betaken.</a>
<a id='line_6832'></a>
<a id='line_6833'>I’ve shown him all the people of perdition,</a>
<a id='line_6834'>    And now those spirits I intend to show</a>
<a id='line_6835'>    Who purge themselves beneath thy guardianship.</a>
<a id='line_6836'></a>
<a id='line_6837'>How I have brought him would be long to tell thee.</a>
<a id='line_6838'>    Virtue descendeth from on high that aids me</a>
<a id='line_6839'>    To lead him to behold thee and to hear thee.</a>
<a id='line_6840'></a>
<a id='line_6841'>Now may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming;</a>
<a id='line_6842'>    He seeketh Liberty, which is so dear,</a>
<a id='line_6843'>    As knoweth he who life for her refuses.</a>
<a id='line_6844'></a>
<a id='line_6845'>Thou know’st it; since, for her, to thee not bitter</a>
<a id='line_6846'>    Was death in Utica, where thou didst leave</a>
<a id='line_6847'>    The vesture, that will shine so, the great day.</a>
<a id='line_6848'></a>
<a id='line_6849'>By us the eternal edicts are not broken;</a>
<a id='line_6850'>    Since this one lives, and Minos binds not me;</a>
<a id='line_6851'>    But of that circle I, where are the chaste</a>
<a id='line_6852'></a>
<a id='line_6853'>Eyes of thy Marcia, who in looks still prays thee,</a>
<a id='line_6854'>    O holy breast, to hold her as thine own;</a>
<a id='line_6855'>    For her love, then, incline thyself to us.</a>
<a id='line_6856'></a>
<a id='line_6857'>Permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go;</a>
<a id='line_6858'>    I will take back this grace from thee to her,</a>
<a id='line_6859'>    If to be mentioned there below thou deignest.”</a>
<a id='line_6860'></a>
<a id='line_6861'>“Marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes</a>
<a id='line_6862'>    While I was on the other side,” then said he,</a>
<a id='line_6863'>    “That every grace she wished of me I granted;</a>
<a id='line_6864'></a>
<a id='line_6865'>Now that she dwells beyond the evil river,</a>
<a id='line_6866'>    She can no longer move me, by that law</a>
<a id='line_6867'>    Which, when I issued forth from there, was made.</a>
<a id='line_6868'></a>
<a id='line_6869'>But if a Lady of Heaven do move and rule thee,</a>
<a id='line_6870'>    As thou dost say, no flattery is needful;</a>
<a id='line_6871'>    Let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me.</a>
<a id='line_6872'></a>
<a id='line_6873'>Go, then, and see thou gird this one about</a>
<a id='line_6874'>    With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face,</a>
<a id='line_6875'>    So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom,</a>
<a id='line_6876'></a>
<a id='line_6877'>For ’twere not fitting that the eye o’ercast</a>
<a id='line_6878'>    By any mist should go before the first</a>
<a id='line_6879'>    Angel, who is of those of Paradise.</a>
<a id='line_6880'></a>
<a id='line_6881'>This little island round about its base</a>
<a id='line_6882'>    Below there, yonder, where the billow beats it,</a>
<a id='line_6883'>    Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze;</a>
<a id='line_6884'></a>
<a id='line_6885'>No other plant that putteth forth the leaf,</a>
<a id='line_6886'>    Or that doth indurate, can there have life,</a>
<a id='line_6887'>    Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks.</a>
<a id='line_6888'></a>
<a id='line_6889'>Thereafter be not this way your return;</a>
<a id='line_6890'>    The sun, which now is rising, will direct you</a>
<a id='line_6891'>    To take the mount by easier ascent.”</a>
<a id='line_6892'></a>
<a id='line_6893'>With this he vanished; and I raised me up</a>
<a id='line_6894'>    Without a word, and wholly drew myself</a>
<a id='line_6895'>    Unto my Guide, and turned mine eyes to him.</a>
<a id='line_6896'></a>
<a id='line_6897'>And he began: “Son, follow thou my steps;</a>
<a id='line_6898'>    Let us turn back, for on this side declines</a>
<a id='line_6899'>    The plain unto its lower boundaries.”</a>
<a id='line_6900'></a>
<a id='line_6901'>The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour</a>
<a id='line_6902'>    Which fled before it, so that from afar</a>
<a id='line_6903'>    I recognised the trembling of the sea.</a>
<a id='line_6904'></a>
<a id='line_6905'>Along the solitary plain we went</a>
<a id='line_6906'>    As one who unto the lost road returns,</a>
<a id='line_6907'>    And till he finds it seems to go in vain.</a>
<a id='line_6908'></a>
<a id='line_6909'>As soon as we were come to where the dew</a>
<a id='line_6910'>    Fights with the sun, and, being in a part</a>
<a id='line_6911'>    Where shadow falls, little evaporates,</a>
<a id='line_6912'></a>
<a id='line_6913'>Both of his hands upon the grass outspread</a>
<a id='line_6914'>    In gentle manner did my Master place;</a>
<a id='line_6915'>    Whence I, who of his action was aware,</a>
<a id='line_6916'></a>
<a id='line_6917'>Extended unto him my tearful cheeks;</a>
<a id='line_6918'>    There did he make in me uncovered wholly</a>
<a id='line_6919'>    That hue which Hell had covered up in me.</a>
<a id='line_6920'></a>
<a id='line_6921'>Then came we down upon the desert shore</a>
<a id='line_6922'>    Which never yet saw navigate its waters</a>
<a id='line_6923'>    Any that afterward had known return.</a>
<a id='line_6924'></a>
<a id='line_6925'>There he begirt me as the other pleased;</a>
<a id='line_6926'>    O marvellous! for even as he culled</a>
<a id='line_6927'>    The humble plant, such it sprang up again</a>
<a id='line_6928'></a>
<a id='line_6929'>Suddenly there where he uprooted it.</a>

<a id='line_6939'>    Jerusalem with its most lofty point,</a>
<a id='line_6940'></a>
<a id='line_6941'>And night that opposite to him revolves</a>
<a id='line_6942'>    Was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales</a>
<a id='line_6943'>    That fall from out her hand when she exceedeth;</a>
<a id='line_6944'></a>
<a id='line_6945'>So that the white and the vermilion cheeks</a>
<a id='line_6946'>    Of beautiful Aurora, where I was,</a>
<a id='line_6947'>    By too great age were changing into orange.</a>
<a id='line_6948'></a>
<a id='line_6949'>We still were on the border of the sea,</a>
<a id='line_6950'>    Like people who are thinking of their road,</a>
<a id='line_6951'>    Who go in heart and with the body stay;</a>
<a id='line_6952'></a>
<a id='line_6953'>And lo! as when, upon the approach of morning,</a>
<a id='line_6954'>    Through the gross vapours Mars grows fiery red</a>
<a id='line_6955'>    Down in the West upon the ocean floor,</a>
<a id='line_6956'></a>
<a id='line_6957'>Appeared to me—may I again behold it!—</a>
<a id='line_6958'>    A light along the sea so swiftly coming,</a>
<a id='line_6959'>    Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled;</a>
<a id='line_6960'></a>
<a id='line_6961'>From which when I a little had withdrawn</a>
<a id='line_6962'>    Mine eyes, that I might question my Conductor,</a>
<a id='line_6963'>    Again I saw it brighter grown and larger.</a>
<a id='line_6964'></a>
<a id='line_6965'>Then on each side of it appeared to me</a>
<a id='line_6966'>    I knew not what of white, and underneath it</a>
<a id='line_6967'>    Little by little there came forth another.</a>
<a id='line_6968'></a>
<a id='line_6969'>My Master yet had uttered not a word</a>
<a id='line_6970'>    While the first whiteness into wings unfolded;</a>
<a id='line_6971'>    But when he clearly recognised the pilot,</a>
<a id='line_6972'></a>
<a id='line_6973'>He cried: “Make haste, make haste to bow the knee!</a>
<a id='line_6974'>    Behold the Angel of God! fold thou thy hands!</a>
<a id='line_6975'>    Henceforward shalt thou see such officers!</a>
<a id='line_6976'></a>
<a id='line_6977'>See how he scorneth human arguments,</a>
<a id='line_6978'>    So that nor oar he wants, nor other sail</a>
<a id='line_6979'>    Than his own wings, between so distant shores.</a>
<a id='line_6980'></a>
<a id='line_6981'>See how he holds them pointed up to heaven,</a>
<a id='line_6982'>    Fanning the air with the eternal pinions,</a>
<a id='line_6983'>    That do not moult themselves like mortal hair!”</a>
<a id='line_6984'></a>
<a id='line_6985'>Then as still nearer and more near us came</a>
<a id='line_6986'>    The Bird Divine, more radiant he appeared,</a>
<a id='line_6987'>    So that near by the eye could not endure him,</a>
<a id='line_6988'></a>
<a id='line_6989'>But down I cast it; and he came to shore</a>
<a id='line_6990'>    With a small vessel, very swift and light,</a>
<a id='line_6991'>    So that the water swallowed naught thereof.</a>
<a id='line_6992'></a>
<a id='line_6993'>Upon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot;</a>
<a id='line_6994'>    Beatitude seemed written in his face,</a>
<a id='line_6995'>    And more than a hundred spirits sat within.</a>
<a id='line_6996'></a>
<a id='line_6997'>“In exitu Israel de Aegypto!”</a>
<a id='line_6998'>    They chanted all together in one voice,</a>
<a id='line_6999'>    With whatso in that psalm is after written.</a>
<a id='line_7000'></a>
<a id='line_7001'>Then made he sign of holy rood upon them,</a>
<a id='line_7002'>    Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,</a>
<a id='line_7003'>    And he departed swiftly as he came.</a>
<a id='line_7004'></a>
<a id='line_7005'>The throng which still remained there unfamiliar</a>
<a id='line_7006'>    Seemed with the place, all round about them gazing,</a>
<a id='line_7007'>    As one who in new matters makes essay.</a>
<a id='line_7008'></a>
<a id='line_7009'>On every side was darting forth the day.</a>
<a id='line_7010'>    The sun, who had with his resplendent shafts</a>
<a id='line_7011'>    From the mid-heaven chased forth the Capricorn,</a>
<a id='line_7012'></a>
<a id='line_7013'>When the new people lifted up their faces</a>
<a id='line_7014'>    Towards us, saying to us: “If ye know,</a>
<a id='line_7015'>    Show us the way to go unto the mountain.”</a>
<a id='line_7016'></a>
<a id='line_7017'>And answer made Virgilius: “Ye believe</a>
<a id='line_7018'>    Perchance that we have knowledge of this place,</a>
<a id='line_7019'>    But we are strangers even as yourselves.</a>
<a id='line_7020'></a>
<a id='line_7021'>Just now we came, a little while before you,</a>
<a id='line_7022'>    Another way, which was so rough and steep,</a>
<a id='line_7023'>    That mounting will henceforth seem sport to us.”</a>
<a id='line_7024'></a>
<a id='line_7025'>The souls who had, from seeing me draw breath,</a>
<a id='line_7026'>    Become aware that I was still alive,</a>
<a id='line_7027'>    Pallid in their astonishment became;</a>
<a id='line_7028'></a>
<a id='line_7029'>And as to messenger who bears the olive</a>
<a id='line_7030'>    The people throng to listen to the news,</a>
<a id='line_7031'>    And no one shows himself afraid of crowding,</a>
<a id='line_7032'></a>
<a id='line_7033'>So at the sight of me stood motionless</a>
<a id='line_7034'>    Those fortunate spirits, all of them, as if</a>
<a id='line_7035'>    Oblivious to go and make them fair.</a>
<a id='line_7036'></a>
<a id='line_7037'>One from among them saw I coming forward,</a>
<a id='line_7038'>    As to embrace me, with such great affection,</a>
<a id='line_7039'>    That it incited me to do the like.</a>
<a id='line_7040'></a>
<a id='line_7041'>O empty shadows, save in aspect only!</a>
<a id='line_7042'>    Three times behind it did I clasp my hands,</a>
<a id='line_7043'>    As oft returned with them to my own breast!</a>
<a id='line_7044'></a>
<a id='line_7045'>I think with wonder I depicted me;</a>
<a id='line_7046'>    Whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew;</a>
<a id='line_7047'>    And I, pursuing it, pressed farther forward.</a>
<a id='line_7048'></a>
<a id='line_7049'>Gently it said that I should stay my steps;</a>
<a id='line_7050'>    Then knew I who it was, and I entreated</a>
<a id='line_7051'>    That it would stop awhile to speak with me.</a>
<a id='line_7052'></a>
<a id='line_7053'>It made reply to me: “Even as I loved thee</a>
<a id='line_7054'>    In mortal body, so I love thee free;</a>
<a id='line_7055'>    Therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?”</a>
<a id='line_7056'></a>
<a id='line_7057'>“My own Casella! to return once more</a>
<a id='line_7058'>    There where I am, I make this journey,” said I;</a>
<a id='line_7059'>    “But how from thee has so much time be taken?”</a>
<a id='line_7060'></a>
<a id='line_7061'>And he to me: “No outrage has been done me,</a>
<a id='line_7062'>    If he who takes both when and whom he pleases</a>
<a id='line_7063'>    Has many times denied to me this passage,</a>
<a id='line_7064'></a>
<a id='line_7065'>For of a righteous will his own is made.</a>
<a id='line_7066'>    He, sooth to say, for three months past has taken</a>
<a id='line_7067'>    Whoever wished to enter with all peace;</a>
<a id='line_7068'></a>
<a id='line_7069'>Whence I, who now had turned unto that shore</a>
<a id='line_7070'>    Where salt the waters of the Tiber grow,</a>
<a id='line_7071'>    Benignantly by him have been received.</a>
<a id='line_7072'></a>
<a id='line_7073'>Unto that outlet now his wing is pointed,</a>
<a id='line_7074'>    Because for evermore assemble there</a>
<a id='line_7075'>    Those who tow’rds Acheron do not descend.”</a>
<a id='line_7076'></a>
<a id='line_7077'>And I: “If some new law take not from thee</a>
<a id='line_7078'>    Memory or practice of the song of love,</a>
<a id='line_7079'>    Which used to quiet in me all my longings,</a>
<a id='line_7080'></a>
<a id='line_7081'>Thee may it please to comfort therewithal</a>
<a id='line_7082'>    Somewhat this soul of mine, that with its body</a>
<a id='line_7083'>    Hitherward coming is so much distressed.”</a>
<a id='line_7084'></a>
<a id='line_7085'>“Love, that within my mind discourses with me,”</a>
<a id='line_7086'>    Forthwith began he so melodiously,</a>
<a id='line_7087'>    The melody within me still is sounding.</a>
<a id='line_7088'></a>
<a id='line_7089'>My Master, and myself, and all that people</a>
<a id='line_7090'>    Which with him were, appeared as satisfied</a>
<a id='line_7091'>    As if naught else might touch the mind of any.</a>
<a id='line_7092'></a>
<a id='line_7093'>We all of us were moveless and attentive</a>
<a id='line_7094'>    Unto his notes; and lo! the grave old man,</a>
<a id='line_7095'>    Exclaiming: “What is this, ye laggard spirits?</a>
<a id='line_7096'></a>
<a id='line_7097'>What negligence, what standing still is this?</a>
<a id='line_7098'>    Run to the mountain to strip off the slough,</a>
<a id='line_7099'>    That lets not God be manifest to you.”</a>
<a id='line_7100'></a>
<a id='line_7101'>Even as when, collecting grain or tares,</a>
<a id='line_7102'>    The doves, together at their pasture met,</a>
<a id='line_7103'>    Quiet, nor showing their accustomed pride,</a>

<a id='line_7108'></a>
<a id='line_7109'>So that fresh company did I behold</a>
<a id='line_7110'>    The song relinquish, and go tow’rds the hill,</a>
<a id='line_7111'>    As one who goes, and knows not whitherward;</a>

<a id='line_7137'>Let loose its faculties as if delighted,</a>
<a id='line_7138'>    And I my sight directed to the hill</a>
<a id='line_7139'>    That highest tow’rds the heaven uplifts itself.</a>
<a id='line_7140'></a>
<a id='line_7141'>The sun, that in our rear was flaming red,</a>
<a id='line_7142'>    Was broken in front of me into the figure</a>
<a id='line_7143'>    Which had in me the stoppage of its rays;</a>
<a id='line_7144'></a>
<a id='line_7145'>Unto one side I turned me, with the fear</a>
<a id='line_7146'>    Of being left alone, when I beheld</a>
<a id='line_7147'>    Only in front of me the ground obscured.</a>
<a id='line_7148'></a>
<a id='line_7149'>“Why dost thou still mistrust?” my Comforter</a>
<a id='line_7150'>    Began to say to me turned wholly round;</a>
<a id='line_7151'>    “Dost thou not think me with thee, and that I guide thee?</a>
<a id='line_7152'></a>
<a id='line_7153'>’Tis evening there already where is buried</a>
<a id='line_7154'>    The body within which I cast a shadow;</a>
<a id='line_7155'>    ’Tis from Brundusium ta’en, and Naples has it.</a>
<a id='line_7156'></a>
<a id='line_7157'>Now if in front of me no shadow fall,</a>
<a id='line_7158'>    Marvel not at it more than at the heavens,</a>
<a id='line_7159'>    Because one ray impedeth not another</a>
<a id='line_7160'></a>
<a id='line_7161'>To suffer torments, both of cold and heat,</a>
<a id='line_7162'>    Bodies like this that Power provides, which wills</a>
<a id='line_7163'>    That how it works be not unveiled to us.</a>
<a id='line_7164'></a>
<a id='line_7165'>Insane is he who hopeth that our reason</a>
<a id='line_7166'>    Can traverse the illimitable way,</a>

<a id='line_7171'>    No need there were for Mary to give birth;</a>
<a id='line_7172'></a>
<a id='line_7173'>And ye have seen desiring without fruit,</a>
<a id='line_7174'>    Those whose desire would have been quieted,</a>
<a id='line_7175'>    Which evermore is given them for a grief.</a>
<a id='line_7176'></a>
<a id='line_7177'>I speak of Aristotle and of Plato,</a>
<a id='line_7178'>    And many others;”—and here bowed his head,</a>
<a id='line_7179'>    And more he said not, and remained disturbed.</a>
<a id='line_7180'></a>
<a id='line_7181'>We came meanwhile unto the mountain’s foot;</a>
<a id='line_7182'>    There so precipitate we found the rock,</a>
<a id='line_7183'>    That nimble legs would there have been in vain.</a>
<a id='line_7184'></a>
<a id='line_7185'>’Twixt Lerici and Turbia, the most desert,</a>
<a id='line_7186'>    The most secluded pathway is a stair</a>
<a id='line_7187'>    Easy and open, if compared with that.</a>
<a id='line_7188'></a>
<a id='line_7189'>“Who knoweth now upon which hand the hill</a>
<a id='line_7190'>    Slopes down,” my Master said, his footsteps staying,</a>
<a id='line_7191'>    “So that who goeth without wings may mount?”</a>
<a id='line_7192'></a>
<a id='line_7193'>And while he held his eyes upon the ground</a>
<a id='line_7194'>    Examining the nature of the path,</a>
<a id='line_7195'>    And I was looking up around the rock,</a>
<a id='line_7196'></a>
<a id='line_7197'>On the left hand appeared to me a throng</a>
<a id='line_7198'>    Of souls, that moved their feet in our direction,</a>
<a id='line_7199'>    And did not seem to move, they came so slowly.</a>
<a id='line_7200'></a>
<a id='line_7201'>“Lift up thine eyes,” I to the Master said;</a>
<a id='line_7202'>    “Behold, on this side, who will give us counsel,</a>
<a id='line_7203'>    If thou of thine own self can have it not.”</a>
<a id='line_7204'></a>
<a id='line_7205'>Then he looked at me, and with frank expression</a>
<a id='line_7206'>    Replied: “Let us go there, for they come slowly,</a>
<a id='line_7207'>    And thou be steadfast in thy hope, sweet son.”</a>
<a id='line_7208'></a>
<a id='line_7209'>Still was that people as far off from us,</a>
<a id='line_7210'>    After a thousand steps of ours I say,</a>
<a id='line_7211'>    As a good thrower with his hand would reach,</a>
<a id='line_7212'></a>
<a id='line_7213'>When they all crowded unto the hard masses</a>
<a id='line_7214'>    Of the high bank, and motionless stood and close,</a>
<a id='line_7215'>    As he stands still to look who goes in doubt.</a>
<a id='line_7216'></a>
<a id='line_7217'>“O happy dead!  O spirits elect already!”</a>
<a id='line_7218'>    Virgilius made beginning, “by that peace</a>
<a id='line_7219'>    Which I believe is waiting for you all,</a>
<a id='line_7220'></a>
<a id='line_7221'>Tell us upon what side the mountain slopes,</a>
<a id='line_7222'>    So that the going up be possible,</a>
<a id='line_7223'>    For to lose time irks him most who most knows.”</a>
<a id='line_7224'></a>
<a id='line_7225'>As sheep come issuing forth from out the fold</a>
<a id='line_7226'>    By ones and twos and threes, and the others stand</a>
<a id='line_7227'>    Timidly, holding down their eyes and nostrils,</a>
<a id='line_7228'></a>
<a id='line_7229'>And what the foremost does the others do,</a>
<a id='line_7230'>    Huddling themselves against her, if she stop,</a>
<a id='line_7231'>    Simple and quiet and the wherefore know not;</a>
<a id='line_7232'></a>
<a id='line_7233'>So moving to approach us thereupon</a>
<a id='line_7234'>    I saw the leader of that fortunate flock,</a>
<a id='line_7235'>    Modest in face and dignified in gait.</a>
<a id='line_7236'></a>
<a id='line_7237'>As soon as those in the advance saw broken</a>
<a id='line_7238'>    The light upon the ground at my right side,</a>
<a id='line_7239'>    So that from me the shadow reached the rock,</a>
<a id='line_7240'></a>
<a id='line_7241'>They stopped, and backward drew themselves somewhat;</a>
<a id='line_7242'>    And all the others, who came after them,</a>
<a id='line_7243'>    Not knowing why nor wherefore, did the same.</a>
<a id='line_7244'></a>
<a id='line_7245'>“Without your asking, I confess to you</a>
<a id='line_7246'>    This is a human body which you see,</a>
<a id='line_7247'>    Whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft.</a>
<a id='line_7248'></a>
<a id='line_7249'>Marvel ye not thereat, but be persuaded</a>
<a id='line_7250'>    That not without a power which comes from Heaven</a>
<a id='line_7251'>    Doth he endeavour to surmount this wall.”</a>
<a id='line_7252'></a>
<a id='line_7253'>The Master thus; and said those worthy people:</a>
<a id='line_7254'>    “Return ye then, and enter in before us,”</a>
<a id='line_7255'>    Making a signal with the back o’ the hand</a>
<a id='line_7256'></a>
<a id='line_7257'>And one of them began: “Whoe’er thou art,</a>
<a id='line_7258'>    Thus going turn thine eyes, consider well</a>
<a id='line_7259'>    If e’er thou saw me in the other world.”</a>
<a id='line_7260'></a>
<a id='line_7261'>I turned me tow’rds him, and looked at him closely;</a>
<a id='line_7262'>    Blond was he, beautiful, and of noble aspect,</a>
<a id='line_7263'>    But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided.</a>
<a id='line_7264'></a>
<a id='line_7265'>When with humility I had disclaimed</a>
<a id='line_7266'>    E’er having seen him, “Now behold!” he said,</a>
<a id='line_7267'>    And showed me high upon his breast a wound.</a>
<a id='line_7268'></a>
<a id='line_7269'>Then said he with a smile: “I am Manfredi,</a>
<a id='line_7270'>    The grandson of the Empress Costanza;</a>
<a id='line_7271'>    Therefore, when thou returnest, I beseech thee</a>
<a id='line_7272'></a>
<a id='line_7273'>Go to my daughter beautiful, the mother</a>

<a id='line_7275'>    And the truth tell her, if aught else be told.</a>
<a id='line_7276'></a>
<a id='line_7277'>After I had my body lacerated</a>
<a id='line_7278'>    By these two mortal stabs, I gave myself</a>
<a id='line_7279'>    Weeping to Him, who willingly doth pardon.</a>
<a id='line_7280'></a>
<a id='line_7281'>Horrible my iniquities had been;</a>
<a id='line_7282'>    But Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms,</a>
<a id='line_7283'>    That it receives whatever turns to it.</a>
<a id='line_7284'></a>
<a id='line_7285'>Had but Cosenza’s pastor, who in chase</a>

<a id='line_7288'></a>

<a id='line_7296'></a>
<a id='line_7297'>By malison of theirs is not so lost</a>
<a id='line_7298'>    Eternal Love, that it cannot return,</a>

<a id='line_7320'></a>
<a id='line_7321'>Whenever by delight or else by pain,</a>
<a id='line_7322'>    That seizes any faculty of ours,</a>
<a id='line_7323'>    Wholly to that the soul collects itself,</a>
<a id='line_7324'></a>
<a id='line_7325'>It seemeth that no other power it heeds;</a>
<a id='line_7326'>    And this against that error is which thinks</a>
<a id='line_7327'>    One soul above another kindles in us.</a>
<a id='line_7328'></a>
<a id='line_7329'>And hence, whenever aught is heard or seen</a>
<a id='line_7330'>    Which keeps the soul intently bent upon it,</a>
<a id='line_7331'>    Time passes on, and we perceive it not,</a>
<a id='line_7332'></a>
<a id='line_7333'>Because one faculty is that which listens,</a>
<a id='line_7334'>    And other that which the soul keeps entire;</a>
<a id='line_7335'>    This is as if in bonds, and that is free.</a>
<a id='line_7336'></a>
<a id='line_7337'>Of this I had experience positive</a>
<a id='line_7338'>    In hearing and in gazing at that spirit;</a>
<a id='line_7339'>    For fifty full degrees uprisen was</a>
<a id='line_7340'></a>
<a id='line_7341'>The sun, and I had not perceived it, when</a>
<a id='line_7342'>    We came to where those souls with one accord</a>
<a id='line_7343'>    Cried out unto us: “Here is what you ask.”</a>
<a id='line_7344'></a>
<a id='line_7345'>A greater opening ofttimes hedges up</a>

<a id='line_7347'>    The villager, what time the grape imbrowns,</a>
<a id='line_7348'></a>
<a id='line_7349'>Than was the passage-way through which ascended</a>
<a id='line_7350'>    Only my Leader and myself behind him,</a>
<a id='line_7351'>    After that company departed from us.</a>
<a id='line_7352'></a>
<a id='line_7353'>One climbs Sanleo and descends in Noli,</a>
<a id='line_7354'>    And mounts the summit of Bismantova,</a>
<a id='line_7355'>    With feet alone; but here one needs must fly;</a>
<a id='line_7356'></a>
<a id='line_7357'>With the swift pinions and the plumes I say</a>
<a id='line_7358'>    Of great desire, conducted after him</a>
<a id='line_7359'>    Who gave me hope, and made a light for me.</a>
<a id='line_7360'></a>
<a id='line_7361'>We mounted upward through the rifted rock,</a>
<a id='line_7362'>    And on each side the border pressed upon us,</a>
<a id='line_7363'>    And feet and hands the ground beneath required.</a>
<a id='line_7364'></a>
<a id='line_7365'>When we were come upon the upper rim</a>
<a id='line_7366'>    Of the high bank, out on the open slope,</a>
<a id='line_7367'>    “My Master,” said I, “what way shall we take?”</a>
<a id='line_7368'></a>
<a id='line_7369'>And he to me: “No step of thine descend;</a>
<a id='line_7370'>    Still up the mount behind me win thy way,</a>
<a id='line_7371'>    Till some sage escort shall appear to us.”</a>
<a id='line_7372'></a>
<a id='line_7373'>The summit was so high it vanquished sight,</a>
<a id='line_7374'>    And the hillside precipitous far more</a>
<a id='line_7375'>    Than line from middle quadrant to the centre.</a>
<a id='line_7376'></a>
<a id='line_7377'>Spent with fatigue was I, when I began:</a>
<a id='line_7378'>    “O my sweet Father! turn thee and behold</a>
<a id='line_7379'>    How I remain alone, unless thou stay!”</a>
<a id='line_7380'></a>
<a id='line_7381'>“O son,” he said, “up yonder drag thyself,”</a>
<a id='line_7382'>    Pointing me to a terrace somewhat higher,</a>
<a id='line_7383'>    Which on that side encircles all the hill.</a>
<a id='line_7384'></a>
<a id='line_7385'>These words of his so spurred me on, that I</a>
<a id='line_7386'>    Strained every nerve, behind him scrambling up,</a>
<a id='line_7387'>    Until the circle was beneath my feet.</a>
<a id='line_7388'></a>
<a id='line_7389'>Thereon ourselves we seated both of us</a>
<a id='line_7390'>    Turned to the East, from which we had ascended,</a>
<a id='line_7391'>    For all men are delighted to look back.</a>
<a id='line_7392'></a>
<a id='line_7393'>To the low shores mine eyes I first directed,</a>
<a id='line_7394'>    Then to the sun uplifted them, and wondered</a>
<a id='line_7395'>    That on the left hand we were smitten by it.</a>
<a id='line_7396'></a>
<a id='line_7397'>The Poet well perceived that I was wholly</a>
<a id='line_7398'>    Bewildered at the chariot of the light,</a>
<a id='line_7399'>    Where ’twixt us and the Aquilon it entered.</a>
<a id='line_7400'></a>
<a id='line_7401'>Whereon he said to me: “If Castor and Pollux</a>
<a id='line_7402'>    Were in the company of yonder mirror,</a>
<a id='line_7403'>    That up and down conducteth with its light,</a>
<a id='line_7404'></a>
<a id='line_7405'>Thou wouldst behold the zodiac’s jagged wheel</a>
<a id='line_7406'>    Revolving still more near unto the Bears,</a>
<a id='line_7407'>    Unless it swerved aside from its old track.</a>
<a id='line_7408'></a>
<a id='line_7409'>How that may be wouldst thou have power to think,</a>
<a id='line_7410'>    Collected in thyself, imagine Zion</a>
<a id='line_7411'>    Together with this mount on earth to stand,</a>
<a id='line_7412'></a>
<a id='line_7413'>So that they both one sole horizon have,</a>
<a id='line_7414'>    And hemispheres diverse; whereby the road</a>
<a id='line_7415'>    Which Phaeton, alas! knew not to drive,</a>
<a id='line_7416'></a>
<a id='line_7417'>Thou’lt see how of necessity must pass</a>
<a id='line_7418'>    This on one side, when that upon the other,</a>
<a id='line_7419'>    If thine intelligence right clearly heed.”</a>
<a id='line_7420'></a>
<a id='line_7421'>“Truly, my Master,” said I, “never yet</a>
<a id='line_7422'>    Saw I so clearly as I now discern,</a>
<a id='line_7423'>    There where my wit appeared incompetent,</a>
<a id='line_7424'></a>
<a id='line_7425'>That the mid-circle of supernal motion,</a>
<a id='line_7426'>    Which in some art is the Equator called,</a>
<a id='line_7427'>    And aye remains between the Sun and Winter,</a>
<a id='line_7428'></a>
<a id='line_7429'>For reason which thou sayest, departeth hence</a>
<a id='line_7430'>    Tow’rds the Septentrion, what time the Hebrews</a>
<a id='line_7431'>    Beheld it tow’rds the region of the heat.</a>
<a id='line_7432'></a>
<a id='line_7433'>But, if it pleaseth thee, I fain would learn</a>
<a id='line_7434'>    How far we have to go; for the hill rises</a>
<a id='line_7435'>    Higher than eyes of mine have power to rise.”</a>
<a id='line_7436'></a>
<a id='line_7437'>And he to me: “This mount is such, that ever</a>
<a id='line_7438'>    At the beginning down below ’tis tiresome,</a>
<a id='line_7439'>    And aye the more one climbs, the less it hurts.</a>
<a id='line_7440'></a>
<a id='line_7441'>Therefore, when it shall seem so pleasant to thee,</a>
<a id='line_7442'>    That going up shall be to thee as easy</a>
<a id='line_7443'>    As going down the current in a boat,</a>
<a id='line_7444'></a>
<a id='line_7445'>Then at this pathway’s ending thou wilt be;</a>
<a id='line_7446'>    There to repose thy panting breath expect;</a>
<a id='line_7447'>    No more I answer; and this I know for true.”</a>
<a id='line_7448'></a>
<a id='line_7449'>And as he finished uttering these words,</a>
<a id='line_7450'>    A voice close by us sounded: “Peradventure</a>
<a id='line_7451'>    Thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that.”</a>
<a id='line_7452'></a>
<a id='line_7453'>At sound thereof each one of us turned round,</a>
<a id='line_7454'>    And saw upon the left hand a great rock,</a>
<a id='line_7455'>    Which neither I nor he before had noticed.</a>
<a id='line_7456'></a>
<a id='line_7457'>Thither we drew; and there were persons there</a>
<a id='line_7458'>    Who in the shadow stood behind the rock,</a>
<a id='line_7459'>    As one through indolence is wont to stand.</a>
<a id='line_7460'></a>
<a id='line_7461'>And one of them, who seemed to me fatigued,</a>
<a id='line_7462'>    Was sitting down, and both his knees embraced,</a>
<a id='line_7463'>    Holding his face low down between them bowed.</a>
<a id='line_7464'></a>
<a id='line_7465'>“O my sweet Lord,” I said, “do turn thine eye</a>
<a id='line_7466'>    On him who shows himself more negligent</a>
<a id='line_7467'>    Then even Sloth herself his sister were.”</a>
<a id='line_7468'></a>
<a id='line_7469'>Then he turned round to us, and he gave heed,</a>
<a id='line_7470'>    Just lifting up his eyes above his thigh,</a>
<a id='line_7471'>    And said: “Now go thou up, for thou art valiant.”</a>
<a id='line_7472'></a>
<a id='line_7473'>Then knew I who he was; and the distress,</a>
<a id='line_7474'>    That still a little did my breathing quicken,</a>
<a id='line_7475'>    My going to him hindered not; and after</a>
<a id='line_7476'></a>
<a id='line_7477'>I came to him he hardly raised his head,</a>
<a id='line_7478'>    Saying: “Hast thou seen clearly how the sun</a>
<a id='line_7479'>    O’er thy left shoulder drives his chariot?”</a>
<a id='line_7480'></a>
<a id='line_7481'>His sluggish attitude and his curt words</a>
<a id='line_7482'>    A little unto laughter moved my lips;</a>
<a id='line_7483'>    Then I began: “Belacqua, I grieve not</a>
<a id='line_7484'></a>
<a id='line_7485'>For thee henceforth; but tell me, wherefore seated</a>
<a id='line_7486'>    In this place art thou?  Waitest thou an escort?</a>
<a id='line_7487'>    Or has thy usual habit seized upon thee?”</a>
<a id='line_7488'></a>
<a id='line_7489'>And he: “O brother, what’s the use of climbing?</a>
<a id='line_7490'>    Since to my torment would not let me go</a>
<a id='line_7491'>    The Angel of God, who sitteth at the gate.</a>
<a id='line_7492'></a>
<a id='line_7493'>First heaven must needs so long revolve me round</a>
<a id='line_7494'>    Outside thereof, as in my life it did,</a>
<a id='line_7495'>    Since the good sighs I to the end postponed,</a>
<a id='line_7496'></a>
<a id='line_7497'>Unless, e’er that, some prayer may bring me aid</a>
<a id='line_7498'>    Which rises from a heart that lives in grace;</a>
<a id='line_7499'>    What profit others that in heaven are heard not?”</a>
<a id='line_7500'></a>
<a id='line_7501'>Meanwhile the Poet was before me mounting,</a>
<a id='line_7502'>    And saying: “Come now; see the sun has touched</a>
<a id='line_7503'>    Meridian, and from the shore the night</a>
<a id='line_7504'></a>
<a id='line_7505'>Covers already with her foot Morocco.”</a>
<a id='line_7506'></a>
<a id='line_7507'></a>

<a id='line_7509'></a>
<a id='line_7510'>Purgatorio: Canto V</a>
<a id='line_7511'></a>
<a id='line_7512'></a>
<a id='line_7513'>I had already from those shades departed,</a>
<a id='line_7514'>    And followed in the footsteps of my Guide,</a>
<a id='line_7515'>    When from behind, pointing his finger at me,</a>
<a id='line_7516'></a>
<a id='line_7517'>One shouted: “See, it seems as if shone not</a>
<a id='line_7518'>    The sunshine on the left of him below,</a>
<a id='line_7519'>    And like one living seems he to conduct him.”</a>
<a id='line_7520'></a>
<a id='line_7521'>Mine eyes I turned at utterance of these words,</a>
<a id='line_7522'>    And saw them watching with astonishment</a>
<a id='line_7523'>    But me, but me, and the light which was broken!</a>
<a id='line_7524'></a>
<a id='line_7525'>“Why doth thy mind so occupy itself,”</a>
<a id='line_7526'>    The Master said, “that thou thy pace dost slacken?</a>
<a id='line_7527'>    What matters it to thee what here is whispered?</a>
<a id='line_7528'></a>
<a id='line_7529'>Come after me, and let the people talk;</a>
<a id='line_7530'>    Stand like a steadfast tower, that never wags</a>
<a id='line_7531'>    Its top for all the blowing of the winds;</a>
<a id='line_7532'></a>
<a id='line_7533'>For evermore the man in whom is springing</a>
<a id='line_7534'>    Thought upon thought, removes from him the mark,</a>
<a id='line_7535'>    Because the force of one the other weakens.”</a>
<a id='line_7536'></a>
<a id='line_7537'>What could I say in answer but “I come”?</a>
<a id='line_7538'>    I said it somewhat with that colour tinged</a>
<a id='line_7539'>    Which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy.</a>
<a id='line_7540'></a>
<a id='line_7541'>Meanwhile along the mountain-side across</a>
<a id='line_7542'>    Came people in advance of us a little,</a>
<a id='line_7543'>    Singing the Miserere verse by verse.</a>
<a id='line_7544'></a>
<a id='line_7545'>When they became aware I gave no place</a>
<a id='line_7546'>    For passage of the sunshine through my body,</a>
<a id='line_7547'>    They changed their song into a long, hoarse “Oh!”</a>
<a id='line_7548'></a>
<a id='line_7549'>And two of them, in form of messengers,</a>
<a id='line_7550'>    Ran forth to meet us, and demanded of us,</a>
<a id='line_7551'>    “Of your condition make us cognisant.”</a>
<a id='line_7552'></a>
<a id='line_7553'>And said my Master: “Ye can go your way</a>
<a id='line_7554'>    And carry back again to those who sent you,</a>
<a id='line_7555'>    That this one’s body is of very flesh.</a>
<a id='line_7556'></a>
<a id='line_7557'>If they stood still because they saw his shadow,</a>
<a id='line_7558'>    As I suppose, enough is answered them;</a>
<a id='line_7559'>    Him let them honour, it may profit them.”</a>
<a id='line_7560'></a>
<a id='line_7561'>Vapours enkindled saw I ne’er so swiftly</a>
<a id='line_7562'>    At early nightfall cleave the air serene,</a>
<a id='line_7563'>    Nor, at the set of sun, the clouds of August,</a>
<a id='line_7564'></a>
<a id='line_7565'>But upward they returned in briefer time,</a>
<a id='line_7566'>    And, on arriving, with the others wheeled</a>
<a id='line_7567'>    Tow’rds us, like troops that run without a rein.</a>
<a id='line_7568'></a>
<a id='line_7569'>“This folk that presses unto us is great,</a>
<a id='line_7570'>    And cometh to implore thee,” said the Poet;</a>
<a id='line_7571'>    “So still go onward, and in going listen.”</a>
<a id='line_7572'></a>
<a id='line_7573'>“O soul that goest to beatitude</a>
<a id='line_7574'>    With the same members wherewith thou wast born,”</a>
<a id='line_7575'>    Shouting they came, “a little stay thy steps,</a>
<a id='line_7576'></a>
<a id='line_7577'>Look, if thou e’er hast any of us seen,</a>
<a id='line_7578'>    So that o’er yonder thou bear news of him;</a>
<a id='line_7579'>    Ah, why dost thou go on?  Ah, why not stay?</a>
<a id='line_7580'></a>
<a id='line_7581'>Long since we all were slain by violence,</a>
<a id='line_7582'>    And sinners even to the latest hour;</a>
<a id='line_7583'>    Then did a light from heaven admonish us,</a>
<a id='line_7584'></a>
<a id='line_7585'>So that, both penitent and pardoning, forth</a>
<a id='line_7586'>    From life we issued reconciled to God,</a>
<a id='line_7587'>    Who with desire to see Him stirs our hearts.”</a>
<a id='line_7588'></a>
<a id='line_7589'>And I: “Although I gaze into your faces,</a>
<a id='line_7590'>    No one I recognize; but if may please you</a>
<a id='line_7591'>    Aught I have power to do, ye well-born spirits,</a>
<a id='line_7592'></a>
<a id='line_7593'>Speak ye, and I will do it, by that peace</a>
<a id='line_7594'>    Which, following the feet of such a Guide,</a>
<a id='line_7595'>    From world to world makes itself sought by me.”</a>
<a id='line_7596'></a>
<a id='line_7597'>And one began: “Each one has confidence</a>
<a id='line_7598'>    In thy good offices without an oath,</a>
<a id='line_7599'>    Unless the I cannot cut off the I will;</a>
<a id='line_7600'></a>
<a id='line_7601'>Whence I, who speak alone before the others,</a>
<a id='line_7602'>    Pray thee, if ever thou dost see the land</a>
<a id='line_7603'>    That ’twixt Romagna lies and that of Charles,</a>
<a id='line_7604'></a>
<a id='line_7605'>Thou be so courteous to me of thy prayers</a>
<a id='line_7606'>    In Fano, that they pray for me devoutly,</a>
<a id='line_7607'>    That I may purge away my grave offences.</a>
<a id='line_7608'></a>
<a id='line_7609'>From thence was I; but the deep wounds, through which</a>
<a id='line_7610'>    Issued the blood wherein I had my seat,</a>
<a id='line_7611'>    Were dealt me in bosom of the Antenori,</a>
<a id='line_7612'></a>
<a id='line_7613'>There where I thought to be the most secure;</a>
<a id='line_7614'>    ’Twas he of Este had it done, who held me</a>
<a id='line_7615'>    In hatred far beyond what justice willed.</a>
<a id='line_7616'></a>
<a id='line_7617'>But if towards the Mira I had fled,</a>
<a id='line_7618'>    When I was overtaken at Oriaco,</a>
<a id='line_7619'>    I still should be o’er yonder where men breathe.</a>
<a id='line_7620'></a>
<a id='line_7621'>I ran to the lagoon, and reeds and mire</a>
<a id='line_7622'>    Did so entangle me I fell, and saw there</a>
<a id='line_7623'>    A lake made from my veins upon the ground.”</a>
<a id='line_7624'></a>
<a id='line_7625'>Then said another: “Ah, be that desire</a>
<a id='line_7626'>    Fulfilled that draws thee to the lofty mountain,</a>
<a id='line_7627'>    As thou with pious pity aidest mine.</a>
<a id='line_7628'></a>
<a id='line_7629'>I was of Montefeltro, and am Buonconte;</a>
<a id='line_7630'>    Giovanna, nor none other cares for me;</a>
<a id='line_7631'>    Hence among these I go with downcast front.”</a>
<a id='line_7632'></a>
<a id='line_7633'>And I to him: “What violence or what chance</a>
<a id='line_7634'>    Led thee astray so far from Campaldino,</a>
<a id='line_7635'>    That never has thy sepulture been known?”</a>
<a id='line_7636'></a>
<a id='line_7637'>“Oh,” he replied, “at Casentino’s foot</a>
<a id='line_7638'>    A river crosses named Archiano, born</a>
<a id='line_7639'>    Above the Hermitage in Apennine.</a>
<a id='line_7640'></a>
<a id='line_7641'>There where the name thereof becometh void</a>
<a id='line_7642'>    Did I arrive, pierced through and through the throat,</a>
<a id='line_7643'>    Fleeing on foot, and bloodying the plain;</a>
<a id='line_7644'></a>
<a id='line_7645'>There my sight lost I, and my utterance</a>
<a id='line_7646'>    Ceased in the name of Mary, and thereat</a>

<a id='line_7648'></a>
<a id='line_7649'>Truth will I speak, repeat it to the living;</a>
<a id='line_7650'>    God’s Angel took me up, and he of hell</a>
<a id='line_7651'>    Shouted: ‘O thou from heaven, why dost thou rob me?</a>
<a id='line_7652'></a>
<a id='line_7653'>Thou bearest away the eternal part of him,</a>
<a id='line_7654'>    For one poor little tear, that takes him from me;</a>
<a id='line_7655'>    But with the rest I’ll deal in other fashion!’</a>

<a id='line_7657'>Well knowest thou how in the air is gathered</a>
<a id='line_7658'>    That humid vapour which to water turns,</a>
<a id='line_7659'>    Soon as it rises where the cold doth grasp it.</a>
<a id='line_7660'></a>
<a id='line_7661'>He joined that evil will, which aye seeks evil,</a>
<a id='line_7662'>    To intellect, and moved the mist and wind</a>
<a id='line_7663'>    By means of power, which his own nature gave;</a>

<a id='line_7665'>Thereafter, when the day was spent, the valley</a>
<a id='line_7666'>    From Pratomagno to the great yoke covered</a>
<a id='line_7667'>    With fog, and made the heaven above intent,</a>
<a id='line_7668'></a>
<a id='line_7669'>So that the pregnant air to water changed;</a>
<a id='line_7670'>    Down fell the rain, and to the gullies came</a>
<a id='line_7671'>    Whate’er of it earth tolerated not;</a>
<a id='line_7672'></a>
<a id='line_7673'>And as it mingled with the mighty torrents,</a>
<a id='line_7674'>    Towards the royal river with such speed</a>
<a id='line_7675'>    It headlong rushed, that nothing held it back.</a>
<a id='line_7676'></a>
<a id='line_7677'>My frozen body near unto its outlet</a>
<a id='line_7678'>    The robust Archian found, and into Arno</a>
<a id='line_7679'>    Thrust it, and loosened from my breast the cross</a>
<a id='line_7680'></a>
<a id='line_7681'>I made of me, when agony o’ercame me;</a>
<a id='line_7682'>    It rolled me on the banks and on the bottom,</a>
<a id='line_7683'>    Then with its booty covered and begirt me.”</a>
<a id='line_7684'></a>
<a id='line_7685'>“Ah, when thou hast returned unto the world,</a>

<a id='line_7908'></a>
<a id='line_7909'>After the gracious and glad salutations</a>
<a id='line_7910'>    Had three and four times been reiterated,</a>
<a id='line_7911'>    Sordello backward drew and said, “Who are you?”</a>

<a id='line_7919'>    In this wise then my Leader made reply.</a>
<a id='line_7920'></a>
<a id='line_7921'>As one who suddenly before him sees</a>

<a id='line_7924'></a>
<a id='line_7925'>So he appeared; and then bowed down his brow,</a>
<a id='line_7926'>    And with humility returned towards him,</a>
<a id='line_7927'>    And, where inferiors embrace, embraced him.</a>
<a id='line_7928'></a>
<a id='line_7929'>“O glory of the Latians, thou,” he said,</a>

<a id='line_7936'></a>
<a id='line_7937'>“Through all the circles of the doleful realm,”</a>

<a id='line_7944'></a>
<a id='line_7945'>A place there is below not sad with torments,</a>
<a id='line_7946'>    But darkness only, where the lamentations</a>

<a id='line_7948'></a>
<a id='line_7949'>There dwell I with the little innocents</a>
<a id='line_7950'>    Snatched by the teeth of Death, or ever they</a>

<a id='line_7952'></a>
<a id='line_7953'>There dwell I among those who the three saintly</a>
<a id='line_7954'>    Virtues did not put on, and without vice</a>
<a id='line_7955'>    The others knew and followed all of them.</a>
<a id='line_7956'></a>
<a id='line_7957'>But if thou know and can, some indication</a>
<a id='line_7958'>    Give us by which we may the sooner come</a>
<a id='line_7959'>    Where Purgatory has its right beginning.”</a>
<a id='line_7960'></a>
<a id='line_7961'>He answered: “No fixed place has been assigned us;</a>
<a id='line_7962'>    ’Tis lawful for me to go up and round;</a>
<a id='line_7963'>    So far as I can go, as guide I join thee.</a>
<a id='line_7964'></a>
<a id='line_7965'>But see already how the day declines,</a>
<a id='line_7966'>    And to go up by night we are not able;</a>
<a id='line_7967'>    Therefore ’tis well to think of some fair sojourn.</a>
<a id='line_7968'></a>
<a id='line_7969'>Souls are there on the right hand here withdrawn;</a>
<a id='line_7970'>    If thou permit me I will lead thee to them,</a>
<a id='line_7971'>    And thou shalt know them not without delight.”</a>
<a id='line_7972'></a>
<a id='line_7973'>“How is this?” was the answer; “should one wish</a>
<a id='line_7974'>    To mount by night would he prevented be</a>
<a id='line_7975'>    By others? or mayhap would not have power?”</a>
<a id='line_7976'></a>
<a id='line_7977'>And on the ground the good Sordello drew</a>
<a id='line_7978'>    His finger, saying, “See, this line alone</a>
<a id='line_7979'>    Thou couldst not pass after the sun is gone;</a>
<a id='line_7980'></a>
<a id='line_7981'>Not that aught else would hindrance give, however,</a>
<a id='line_7982'>    To going up, save the nocturnal darkness;</a>
<a id='line_7983'>    This with the want of power the will perplexes.</a>
<a id='line_7984'></a>
<a id='line_7985'>We might indeed therewith return below,</a>
<a id='line_7986'>    And, wandering, walk the hill-side round about,</a>
<a id='line_7987'>    While the horizon holds the day imprisoned.”</a>
<a id='line_7988'></a>
<a id='line_7989'>Thereon my Lord, as if in wonder, said:</a>
<a id='line_7990'>    “Do thou conduct us thither, where thou sayest</a>
<a id='line_7991'>    That we can take delight in tarrying.”</a>
<a id='line_7992'></a>
<a id='line_7993'>Little had we withdrawn us from that place,</a>
<a id='line_7994'>    When I perceived the mount was hollowed out</a>
<a id='line_7995'>    In fashion as the valleys here are hollowed.</a>
<a id='line_7996'></a>
<a id='line_7997'>“Thitherward,” said that shade, “will we repair,</a>
<a id='line_7998'>    Where of itself the hill-side makes a lap,</a>
<a id='line_7999'>    And there for the new day will we await.”</a>
<a id='line_8000'></a>
<a id='line_8001'>’Twixt hill and plain there was a winding path</a>
<a id='line_8002'>    Which led us to the margin of that dell,</a>
<a id='line_8003'>    Where dies the border more than half away.</a>
<a id='line_8004'></a>
<a id='line_8005'>Gold and fine silver, and scarlet and pearl-white,</a>
<a id='line_8006'>    The Indian wood resplendent and serene,</a>
<a id='line_8007'>    Fresh emerald the moment it is broken,</a>
<a id='line_8008'></a>
<a id='line_8009'>By herbage and by flowers within that hollow</a>
<a id='line_8010'>    Planted, each one in colour would be vanquished,</a>
<a id='line_8011'>    As by its greater vanquished is the less.</a>
<a id='line_8012'></a>
<a id='line_8013'>Nor in that place had nature painted only,</a>
<a id='line_8014'>    But of the sweetness of a thousand odours</a>
<a id='line_8015'>    Made there a mingled fragrance and unknown.</a>
<a id='line_8016'></a>
<a id='line_8017'>“Salve Regina,” on the green and flowers</a>
<a id='line_8018'>    There seated, singing, spirits I beheld,</a>
<a id='line_8019'>    Which were not visible outside the valley.</a>
<a id='line_8020'></a>
<a id='line_8021'>“Before the scanty sun now seeks his nest,”</a>
<a id='line_8022'>    Began the Mantuan who had led us thither,</a>
<a id='line_8023'>    “Among them do not wish me to conduct you.</a>

<a id='line_8036'></a>
<a id='line_8037'>The other, who in look doth comfort him,</a>
<a id='line_8038'>    Governed the region where the water springs,</a>
<a id='line_8039'>    The Moldau bears the Elbe, and Elbe the sea.</a>
<a id='line_8040'></a>

<a id='line_8045'>And the small-nosed, who close in council seems</a>
<a id='line_8046'>    With him that has an aspect so benign,</a>
<a id='line_8047'>    Died fleeing and disflowering the lily;</a>
<a id='line_8048'></a>
<a id='line_8049'>Look there, how he is beating at his breast!</a>
<a id='line_8050'>    Behold the other one, who for his cheek</a>
<a id='line_8051'>    Sighing has made of his own palm a bed;</a>
<a id='line_8052'></a>
<a id='line_8053'>Father and father-in-law of France’s Pest</a>
<a id='line_8054'>    Are they, and know his vicious life and lewd,</a>

<a id='line_8056'></a>
<a id='line_8057'>He who appears so stalwart, and chimes in,</a>

<a id='line_8099'>    The day they’ve said to their sweet friends farewell,</a>
<a id='line_8100'></a>
<a id='line_8101'>And the new pilgrim penetrates with love,</a>

<a id='line_8103'>    That seemeth to deplore the dying day,</a>
<a id='line_8104'></a>
<a id='line_8105'>When I began to make of no avail</a>

<a id='line_8107'>    Uprisen, that begged attention with its hand.</a>
<a id='line_8108'></a>
<a id='line_8109'>It joined and lifted upward both its palms,</a>
<a id='line_8110'>    Fixing its eyes upon the orient,</a>
<a id='line_8111'>    As if it said to God, “Naught else I care for.”</a>
<a id='line_8112'></a>
<a id='line_8113'>“Te lucis ante” so devoutly issued</a>
<a id='line_8114'>    Forth from its mouth, and with such dulcet notes,</a>
<a id='line_8115'>    It made me issue forth from my own mind.</a>
<a id='line_8116'></a>
<a id='line_8117'>And then the others, sweetly and devoutly,</a>
<a id='line_8118'>    Accompanied it through all the hymn entire,</a>
<a id='line_8119'>    Having their eyes on the supernal wheels.</a>
<a id='line_8120'></a>
<a id='line_8121'>Here, Reader, fix thine eyes well on the truth,</a>

<a id='line_8124'></a>
<a id='line_8125'>I saw that army of the gentle-born</a>

<a id='line_8127'>    As if in expectation, pale and humble;</a>
<a id='line_8128'></a>
<a id='line_8129'>And from on high come forth and down descend,</a>
<a id='line_8130'>    I saw two Angels with two flaming swords,</a>

<a id='line_8132'></a>
<a id='line_8133'>Green as the little leaflets just now born</a>
<a id='line_8134'>    Their garments were, which, by their verdant pinions</a>
<a id='line_8135'>    Beaten and blown abroad, they trailed behind.</a>
<a id='line_8136'></a>
<a id='line_8137'>One just above us came to take his station,</a>
<a id='line_8138'>    And one descended to the opposite bank,</a>
<a id='line_8139'>    So that the people were contained between them.</a>
<a id='line_8140'></a>
<a id='line_8141'>Clearly in them discerned I the blond head;</a>
<a id='line_8142'>    But in their faces was the eye bewildered,</a>
<a id='line_8143'>    As faculty confounded by excess.</a>
<a id='line_8144'></a>
<a id='line_8145'>“From Mary’s bosom both of them have come,”</a>

<a id='line_8148'></a>
<a id='line_8149'>Whereupon I, who knew not by what road,</a>
<a id='line_8150'>    Turned round about, and closely drew myself,</a>

<a id='line_8152'></a>

<a id='line_8156'></a>
<a id='line_8157'>Only three steps I think that I descended,</a>
<a id='line_8158'>    And was below, and saw one who was looking</a>
<a id='line_8159'>    Only at me, as if he fain would know me.</a>
<a id='line_8160'></a>
<a id='line_8161'>Already now the air was growing dark,</a>
<a id='line_8162'>    But not so that between his eyes and mine</a>
<a id='line_8163'>    It did not show what it before locked up.</a>
<a id='line_8164'></a>
<a id='line_8165'>Tow’rds me he moved, and I tow’rds him did move;</a>
<a id='line_8166'>    Noble Judge Nino! how it me delighted,</a>
<a id='line_8167'>    When I beheld thee not among the damned!</a>
<a id='line_8168'></a>
<a id='line_8169'>No greeting fair was left unsaid between us;</a>
<a id='line_8170'>    Then asked he: “How long is it since thou camest</a>
<a id='line_8171'>    O’er the far waters to the mountain’s foot?”</a>
<a id='line_8172'></a>
<a id='line_8173'>“Oh!” said I to him, “through the dismal places</a>
<a id='line_8174'>    I came this morn; and am in the first life,</a>
<a id='line_8175'>    Albeit the other, going thus, I gain.”</a>
<a id='line_8176'></a>
<a id='line_8177'>And on the instant my reply was heard,</a>
<a id='line_8178'>    He and Sordello both shrank back from me,</a>
<a id='line_8179'>    Like people who are suddenly bewildered.</a>
<a id='line_8180'></a>
<a id='line_8181'>One to Virgilius, and the other turned</a>
<a id='line_8182'>    To one who sat there, crying, “Up, Currado!</a>
<a id='line_8183'>    Come and behold what God in grace has willed!”</a>
<a id='line_8184'></a>
<a id='line_8185'>Then, turned to me: “By that especial grace</a>
<a id='line_8186'>    Thou owest unto Him, who so conceals</a>
<a id='line_8187'>    His own first wherefore, that it has no ford,</a>
<a id='line_8188'></a>
<a id='line_8189'>When thou shalt be beyond the waters wide,</a>
<a id='line_8190'>    Tell my Giovanna that she pray for me,</a>
<a id='line_8191'>    Where answer to the innocent is made.</a>
<a id='line_8192'></a>
<a id='line_8193'>I do not think her mother loves me more,</a>
<a id='line_8194'>    Since she has laid aside her wimple white,</a>
<a id='line_8195'>    Which she, unhappy, needs must wish again.</a>
<a id='line_8196'></a>
<a id='line_8197'>Through her full easily is comprehended</a>
<a id='line_8198'>    How long in woman lasts the fire of love,</a>
<a id='line_8199'>    If eye or touch do not relight it often.</a>
<a id='line_8200'></a>
<a id='line_8201'>So fair a hatchment will not make for her</a>

<a id='line_8203'>    A-field, as would have made Gallura’s Cock.”</a>
<a id='line_8204'></a>
<a id='line_8205'>In this wise spake he, with the stamp impressed</a>
<a id='line_8206'>    Upon his aspect of that righteous zeal</a>
<a id='line_8207'>    Which measurably burneth in the heart.</a>
<a id='line_8208'></a>
<a id='line_8209'>My greedy eyes still wandered up to heaven,</a>
<a id='line_8210'>    Still to that point where slowest are the stars,</a>
<a id='line_8211'>    Even as a wheel the nearest to its axle.</a>
<a id='line_8212'></a>
<a id='line_8213'>And my Conductor: “Son, what dost thou gaze at</a>
<a id='line_8214'>    Up there?”  And I to him: “At those three torches</a>
<a id='line_8215'>    With which this hither pole is all on fire.”</a>
<a id='line_8216'></a>
<a id='line_8217'>And he to me: “The four resplendent stars</a>
<a id='line_8218'>    Thou sawest this morning are down yonder low,</a>
<a id='line_8219'>    And these have mounted up to where those were.”</a>
<a id='line_8220'></a>
<a id='line_8221'>As he was speaking, to himself Sordello</a>
<a id='line_8222'>    Drew him, and said, “Lo there our Adversary!”</a>
<a id='line_8223'>    And pointed with his finger to look thither.</a>
<a id='line_8224'></a>
<a id='line_8225'>Upon the side on which the little valley</a>
<a id='line_8226'>    No barrier hath, a serpent was; perchance</a>

<a id='line_8228'></a>
<a id='line_8229'>’Twixt grass and flowers came on the evil streak,</a>
<a id='line_8230'>    Turning at times its head about, and licking</a>
<a id='line_8231'>    Its back like to a beast that smoothes itself.</a>
<a id='line_8232'></a>
<a id='line_8233'>I did not see, and therefore cannot say</a>
<a id='line_8234'>    How the celestial falcons ’gan to move,</a>
<a id='line_8235'>    But well I saw that they were both in motion.</a>
<a id='line_8236'></a>
<a id='line_8237'>Hearing the air cleft by their verdant wings,</a>
<a id='line_8238'>    The serpent fled, and round the Angels wheeled,</a>
<a id='line_8239'>    Up to their stations flying back alike.</a>
<a id='line_8240'></a>
<a id='line_8241'>The shade that to the Judge had near approached</a>
<a id='line_8242'>    When he had called, throughout that whole assault</a>
<a id='line_8243'>    Had not a moment loosed its gaze on me.</a>
<a id='line_8244'></a>
<a id='line_8245'>“So may the light that leadeth thee on high</a>

<a id='line_8248'></a>
<a id='line_8249'>Began it, “if some true intelligence</a>

<a id='line_8252'></a>
<a id='line_8253'>Currado Malaspina was I called;</a>
<a id='line_8254'>    I’m not the elder, but from him descended;</a>
<a id='line_8255'>    To mine I bore the love which here refineth.”</a>
<a id='line_8256'></a>
<a id='line_8257'>“O,” said I unto him, “through your domains</a>

<a id='line_8272'></a>
<a id='line_8273'>And he: “Now go; for the sun shall not lie</a>

<a id='line_8289'>The concubine of old Tithonus now</a>
<a id='line_8290'>    Gleamed white upon the eastern balcony,</a>

<a id='line_8292'></a>
<a id='line_8293'>With gems her forehead all relucent was,</a>

<a id='line_8296'></a>
<a id='line_8297'>And of the steps, with which she mounts, the Night</a>
<a id='line_8298'>    Had taken two in that place where we were,</a>
<a id='line_8299'>    And now the third was bending down its wings;</a>
<a id='line_8300'></a>
<a id='line_8301'>When I, who something had of Adam in me,</a>
<a id='line_8302'>    Vanquished by sleep, upon the grass reclined,</a>
<a id='line_8303'>    There were all five of us already sat.</a>
<a id='line_8304'></a>
<a id='line_8305'>Just at the hour when her sad lay begins</a>
<a id='line_8306'>    The little swallow, near unto the morning,</a>
<a id='line_8307'>    Perchance in memory of her former woes,</a>
<a id='line_8308'></a>
<a id='line_8309'>And when the mind of man, a wanderer</a>
<a id='line_8310'>    More from the flesh, and less by thought imprisoned,</a>
<a id='line_8311'>    Almost prophetic in its visions is,</a>
<a id='line_8312'></a>
<a id='line_8313'>In dreams it seemed to me I saw suspended</a>
<a id='line_8314'>    An eagle in the sky, with plumes of gold,</a>
<a id='line_8315'>    With wings wide open, and intent to stoop,</a>
<a id='line_8316'></a>
<a id='line_8317'>And this, it seemed to me, was where had been</a>
<a id='line_8318'>    By Ganymede his kith and kin abandoned,</a>
<a id='line_8319'>    When to the high consistory he was rapt.</a>
<a id='line_8320'></a>
<a id='line_8321'>I thought within myself, perchance he strikes</a>
<a id='line_8322'>    From habit only here, and from elsewhere</a>
<a id='line_8323'>    Disdains to bear up any in his feet.</a>
<a id='line_8324'></a>
<a id='line_8325'>Then wheeling somewhat more, it seemed to me,</a>
<a id='line_8326'>    Terrible as the lightning he descended,</a>
<a id='line_8327'>    And snatched me upward even to the fire.</a>
<a id='line_8328'></a>
<a id='line_8329'>Therein it seemed that he and I were burning,</a>
<a id='line_8330'>    And the imagined fire did scorch me so,</a>
<a id='line_8331'>    That of necessity my sleep was broken.</a>
<a id='line_8332'></a>
<a id='line_8333'>Not otherwise Achilles started up,</a>
<a id='line_8334'>    Around him turning his awakened eyes,</a>
<a id='line_8335'>    And knowing not the place in which he was,</a>
<a id='line_8336'></a>
<a id='line_8337'>What time from Chiron stealthily his mother</a>

<a id='line_8339'>    Wherefrom the Greeks withdrew him afterwards,</a>
<a id='line_8340'></a>
<a id='line_8341'>Than I upstarted, when from off my face</a>
<a id='line_8342'>    Sleep fled away; and pallid I became,</a>
<a id='line_8343'>    As doth the man who freezes with affright.</a>
<a id='line_8344'></a>
<a id='line_8345'>Only my Comforter was at my side,</a>

<a id='line_8356'></a>
<a id='line_8357'>Whilom at dawn, which doth precede the day,</a>
<a id='line_8358'>    When inwardly thy spirit was asleep</a>
<a id='line_8359'>    Upon the flowers that deck the land below,</a>
<a id='line_8360'></a>
<a id='line_8361'>There came a Lady and said: ‘I am Lucia;</a>
<a id='line_8362'>    Let me take this one up, who is asleep;</a>

<a id='line_8364'></a>
<a id='line_8365'>Sordello and the other noble shapes</a>
<a id='line_8366'>    Remained; she took thee, and, as day grew bright,</a>
<a id='line_8367'>    Upward she came, and I upon her footsteps.</a>
<a id='line_8368'></a>
<a id='line_8369'>She laid thee here; and first her beauteous eyes</a>
<a id='line_8370'>    That open entrance pointed out to me;</a>
<a id='line_8371'>    Then she and sleep together went away.”</a>
<a id='line_8372'></a>
<a id='line_8373'>In guise of one whose doubts are reassured,</a>
<a id='line_8374'>    And who to confidence his fear doth change,</a>
<a id='line_8375'>    After the truth has been discovered to him,</a>
<a id='line_8376'></a>
<a id='line_8377'>So did I change; and when without disquiet</a>
<a id='line_8378'>    My Leader saw me, up along the cliff</a>
<a id='line_8379'>    He moved, and I behind him, tow’rd the height.</a>
<a id='line_8380'></a>
<a id='line_8381'>Reader, thou seest well how I exalt</a>
<a id='line_8382'>    My theme, and therefore if with greater art</a>
<a id='line_8383'>    I fortify it, marvel not thereat.</a>
<a id='line_8384'></a>
<a id='line_8385'>Nearer approached we, and were in such place,</a>
<a id='line_8386'>    That there, where first appeared to me a rift</a>
<a id='line_8387'>    Like to a crevice that disparts a wall,</a>
<a id='line_8388'></a>
<a id='line_8389'>I saw a portal, and three stairs beneath,</a>
<a id='line_8390'>    Diverse in colour, to go up to it,</a>
<a id='line_8391'>    And a gate-keeper, who yet spake no word.</a>
<a id='line_8392'></a>
<a id='line_8393'>And as I opened more and more mine eyes,</a>
<a id='line_8394'>    I saw him seated on the highest stair,</a>
<a id='line_8395'>    Such in the face that I endured it not.</a>
<a id='line_8396'></a>
<a id='line_8397'>And in his hand he had a naked sword,</a>
<a id='line_8398'>    Which so reflected back the sunbeams tow’rds us,</a>
<a id='line_8399'>    That oft in vain I lifted up mine eyes.</a>
<a id='line_8400'></a>
<a id='line_8401'>“Tell it from where you are, what is’t you wish?”</a>
<a id='line_8402'>    Began he to exclaim; “where is the escort?</a>
<a id='line_8403'>    Take heed your coming hither harm you not!”</a>
<a id='line_8404'></a>
<a id='line_8405'>“A Lady of Heaven, with these things conversant,”</a>
<a id='line_8406'>    My Master answered him, “but even now</a>
<a id='line_8407'>    Said to us, ‘Thither go; there is the portal.’”</a>
<a id='line_8408'></a>
<a id='line_8409'>“And may she speed your footsteps in all good,”</a>
<a id='line_8410'>    Again began the courteous janitor;</a>
<a id='line_8411'>    “Come forward then unto these stairs of ours.”</a>
<a id='line_8412'></a>
<a id='line_8413'>Thither did we approach; and the first stair</a>
<a id='line_8414'>    Was marble white, so polished and so smooth,</a>
<a id='line_8415'>    I mirrored myself therein as I appear.</a>
<a id='line_8416'></a>
<a id='line_8417'>The second, tinct of deeper hue than perse,</a>
<a id='line_8418'>    Was of a calcined and uneven stone,</a>
<a id='line_8419'>    Cracked all asunder lengthwise and across.</a>
<a id='line_8420'></a>
<a id='line_8421'>The third, that uppermost rests massively,</a>
<a id='line_8422'>    Porphyry seemed to me, as flaming red</a>
<a id='line_8423'>    As blood that from a vein is spirting forth.</a>
<a id='line_8424'></a>
<a id='line_8425'>Both of his feet was holding upon this</a>
<a id='line_8426'>    The Angel of God, upon the threshold seated,</a>
<a id='line_8427'>    Which seemed to me a stone of diamond.</a>
<a id='line_8428'></a>
<a id='line_8429'>Along the three stairs upward with good will</a>
<a id='line_8430'>    Did my Conductor draw me, saying: “Ask</a>
<a id='line_8431'>    Humbly that he the fastening may undo.”</a>
<a id='line_8432'></a>
<a id='line_8433'>Devoutly at the holy feet I cast me,</a>
<a id='line_8434'>    For mercy’s sake besought that he would open,</a>
<a id='line_8435'>    But first upon my breast three times I smote.</a>
<a id='line_8436'></a>
<a id='line_8437'>Seven P’s upon my forehead he described</a>
<a id='line_8438'>    With the sword’s point, and, “Take heed that thou wash</a>
<a id='line_8439'>    These wounds, when thou shalt be within,” he said.</a>
<a id='line_8440'></a>
<a id='line_8441'>Ashes, or earth that dry is excavated,</a>
<a id='line_8442'>    Of the same colour were with his attire,</a>
<a id='line_8443'>    And from beneath it he drew forth two keys.</a>
<a id='line_8444'></a>
<a id='line_8445'>One was of gold, and the other was of silver;</a>
<a id='line_8446'>    First with the white, and after with the yellow,</a>
<a id='line_8447'>    Plied he the door, so that I was content.</a>
<a id='line_8448'></a>
<a id='line_8449'>“Whenever faileth either of these keys</a>
<a id='line_8450'>    So that it turn not rightly in the lock,”</a>
<a id='line_8451'>    He said to us, “this entrance doth not open.</a>
<a id='line_8452'></a>
<a id='line_8453'>More precious one is, but the other needs</a>
<a id='line_8454'>    More art and intellect ere it unlock,</a>
<a id='line_8455'>    For it is that which doth the knot unloose.</a>
<a id='line_8456'></a>
<a id='line_8457'>From Peter I have them; and he bade me err</a>
<a id='line_8458'>    Rather in opening than in keeping shut,</a>
<a id='line_8459'>    If people but fall down before my feet.”</a>
<a id='line_8460'></a>
<a id='line_8461'>Then pushed the portals of the sacred door,</a>
<a id='line_8462'>    Exclaiming: “Enter; but I give you warning</a>
<a id='line_8463'>    That forth returns whoever looks behind.”</a>
<a id='line_8464'></a>
<a id='line_8465'>And when upon their hinges were turned round</a>
<a id='line_8466'>    The swivels of that consecrated gate,</a>
<a id='line_8467'>    Which are of metal, massive and sonorous,</a>
<a id='line_8468'></a>
<a id='line_8469'>Roared not so loud, nor so discordant seemed</a>
<a id='line_8470'>    Tarpeia, when was ta’en from it the good</a>
<a id='line_8471'>    Metellus, wherefore meagre it remained.</a>
<a id='line_8472'></a>
<a id='line_8473'>At the first thunder-peal I turned attentive,</a>
<a id='line_8474'>    And “Te Deum laudamus” seemed to hear</a>
<a id='line_8475'>    In voices mingled with sweet melody.</a>
<a id='line_8476'></a>
<a id='line_8477'>Exactly such an image rendered me</a>
<a id='line_8478'>    That which I heard, as we are wont to catch,</a>
<a id='line_8479'>    When people singing with the organ stand;</a>
<a id='line_8480'></a>
<a id='line_8481'>For now we hear, and now hear not, the words.</a>

<a id='line_8487'></a>
<a id='line_8488'></a>
<a id='line_8489'>When we had crossed the threshold of the door</a>
<a id='line_8490'>    Which the perverted love of souls disuses,</a>
<a id='line_8491'>    Because it makes the crooked way seem straight,</a>
<a id='line_8492'></a>
<a id='line_8493'>Re-echoing I heard it closed again;</a>

<a id='line_8495'>    What for my failing had been fit excuse?</a>
<a id='line_8496'></a>
<a id='line_8497'>We mounted upward through a rifted rock,</a>
<a id='line_8498'>    Which undulated to this side and that,</a>
<a id='line_8499'>    Even as a wave receding and advancing.</a>
<a id='line_8500'></a>
<a id='line_8501'>“Here it behoves us use a little art,”</a>
<a id='line_8502'>    Began my Leader, “to adapt ourselves</a>

<a id='line_8504'></a>
<a id='line_8505'>And this our footsteps so infrequent made,</a>
<a id='line_8506'>    That sooner had the moon’s decreasing disk</a>
<a id='line_8507'>    Regained its bed to sink again to rest,</a>
<a id='line_8508'></a>
<a id='line_8509'>Than we were forth from out that needle’s eye;</a>
<a id='line_8510'>    But when we free and in the open were,</a>
<a id='line_8511'>    There where the mountain backward piles itself,</a>
<a id='line_8512'></a>
<a id='line_8513'>I wearied out, and both of us uncertain</a>
<a id='line_8514'>    About our way, we stopped upon a plain</a>
<a id='line_8515'>    More desolate than roads across the deserts.</a>
<a id='line_8516'></a>
<a id='line_8517'>From where its margin borders on the void,</a>
<a id='line_8518'>    To foot of the high bank that ever rises,</a>
<a id='line_8519'>    A human body three times told would measure;</a>
<a id='line_8520'></a>
<a id='line_8521'>And far as eye of mine could wing its flight,</a>
<a id='line_8522'>    Now on the left, and on the right flank now,</a>
<a id='line_8523'>    The same this cornice did appear to me.</a>
<a id='line_8524'></a>
<a id='line_8525'>Thereon our feet had not been moved as yet,</a>
<a id='line_8526'>    When I perceived the embankment round about,</a>
<a id='line_8527'>    Which all right of ascent had interdicted,</a>
<a id='line_8528'></a>
<a id='line_8529'>To be of marble white, and so adorned</a>
<a id='line_8530'>    With sculptures, that not only Polycletus,</a>
<a id='line_8531'>    But Nature’s self, had there been put to shame.</a>
<a id='line_8532'></a>
<a id='line_8533'>The Angel, who came down to earth with tidings</a>
<a id='line_8534'>    Of peace, that had been wept for many a year,</a>
<a id='line_8535'>    And opened Heaven from its long interdict,</a>
<a id='line_8536'></a>
<a id='line_8537'>In front of us appeared so truthfully</a>
<a id='line_8538'>    There sculptured in a gracious attitude,</a>
<a id='line_8539'>    He did not seem an image that is silent.</a>
<a id='line_8540'></a>
<a id='line_8541'>One would have sworn that he was saying, “Ave;”</a>
<a id='line_8542'>    For she was there in effigy portrayed</a>
<a id='line_8543'>    Who turned the key to ope the exalted love,</a>
<a id='line_8544'></a>
<a id='line_8545'>And in her mien this language had impressed,</a>
<a id='line_8546'>    “Ecce ancilla Dei,” as distinctly</a>
<a id='line_8547'>    As any figure stamps itself in wax.</a>
<a id='line_8548'></a>
<a id='line_8549'>“Keep not thy mind upon one place alone,”</a>
<a id='line_8550'>    The gentle Master said, who had me standing</a>
<a id='line_8551'>    Upon that side where people have their hearts;</a>
<a id='line_8552'></a>
<a id='line_8553'>Whereat I moved mine eyes, and I beheld</a>
<a id='line_8554'>    In rear of Mary, and upon that side</a>
<a id='line_8555'>    Where he was standing who conducted me,</a>
<a id='line_8556'></a>
<a id='line_8557'>Another story on the rock imposed;</a>
<a id='line_8558'>    Wherefore I passed Virgilius and drew near,</a>
<a id='line_8559'>    So that before mine eyes it might be set.</a>
<a id='line_8560'></a>
<a id='line_8561'>There sculptured in the self-same marble were</a>
<a id='line_8562'>    The cart and oxen, drawing the holy ark,</a>
<a id='line_8563'>    Wherefore one dreads an office not appointed.</a>
<a id='line_8564'></a>
<a id='line_8565'>People appeared in front, and all of them</a>
<a id='line_8566'>    In seven choirs divided, of two senses</a>
<a id='line_8567'>    Made one say “No,” the other, “Yes, they sing.”</a>
<a id='line_8568'></a>
<a id='line_8569'>Likewise unto the smoke of the frankincense,</a>
<a id='line_8570'>    Which there was imaged forth, the eyes and nose</a>
<a id='line_8571'>    Were in the yes and no discordant made.</a>
<a id='line_8572'></a>
<a id='line_8573'>Preceded there the vessel benedight,</a>
<a id='line_8574'>    Dancing with girded loins, the humble Psalmist,</a>
<a id='line_8575'>    And more and less than King was he in this.</a>
<a id='line_8576'></a>
<a id='line_8577'>Opposite, represented at the window</a>
<a id='line_8578'>    Of a great palace, Michal looked upon him,</a>
<a id='line_8579'>    Even as a woman scornful and afflicted.</a>
<a id='line_8580'></a>
<a id='line_8581'>I moved my feet from where I had been standing,</a>
<a id='line_8582'>    To examine near at hand another story,</a>
<a id='line_8583'>    Which after Michal glimmered white upon me.</a>
<a id='line_8584'></a>
<a id='line_8585'>There the high glory of the Roman Prince</a>
<a id='line_8586'>    Was chronicled, whose great beneficence</a>
<a id='line_8587'>    Moved Gregory to his great victory;</a>
<a id='line_8588'></a>
<a id='line_8589'>’Tis of the Emperor Trajan I am speaking;</a>
<a id='line_8590'>    And a poor widow at his bridle stood,</a>
<a id='line_8591'>    In attitude of weeping and of grief.</a>
<a id='line_8592'></a>
<a id='line_8593'>Around about him seemed it thronged and full</a>
<a id='line_8594'>    Of cavaliers, and the eagles in the gold</a>
<a id='line_8595'>    Above them visibly in the wind were moving.</a>
<a id='line_8596'></a>
<a id='line_8597'>The wretched woman in the midst of these</a>
<a id='line_8598'>    Seemed to be saying: “Give me vengeance, Lord,</a>
<a id='line_8599'>    For my dead son, for whom my heart is breaking.”</a>
<a id='line_8600'></a>
<a id='line_8601'>And he to answer her: “Now wait until</a>
<a id='line_8602'>    I shall return.”  And she: “My Lord,” like one</a>
<a id='line_8603'>    In whom grief is impatient, “shouldst thou not</a>
<a id='line_8604'></a>
<a id='line_8605'>Return?”  And he: “Who shall be where I am</a>
<a id='line_8606'>    Will give it thee.”  And she: “Good deed of others</a>
<a id='line_8607'>    What boots it thee, if thou neglect thine own?”</a>
<a id='line_8608'></a>
<a id='line_8609'>Whence he: “Now comfort thee, for it behoves me</a>
<a id='line_8610'>    That I discharge my duty ere I move;</a>
<a id='line_8611'>    Justice so wills, and pity doth retain me.”</a>
<a id='line_8612'></a>
<a id='line_8613'>He who on no new thing has ever looked</a>
<a id='line_8614'>    Was the creator of this visible language,</a>
<a id='line_8615'>    Novel to us, for here it is not found.</a>
<a id='line_8616'></a>
<a id='line_8617'>While I delighted me in contemplating</a>

<a id='line_8620'></a>
<a id='line_8621'>“Behold, upon this side, but rare they make</a>
<a id='line_8622'>    Their steps,” the Poet murmured, “many people;</a>

<a id='line_8624'></a>
<a id='line_8625'>Mine eyes, that in beholding were intent</a>
<a id='line_8626'>    To see new things, of which they curious are,</a>
<a id='line_8627'>    In turning round towards him were not slow.</a>
<a id='line_8628'></a>
<a id='line_8629'>But still I wish not, Reader, thou shouldst swerve</a>
<a id='line_8630'>    From thy good purposes, because thou hearest</a>
<a id='line_8631'>    How God ordaineth that the debt be paid;</a>
<a id='line_8632'></a>
<a id='line_8633'>Attend not to the fashion of the torment,</a>
<a id='line_8634'>    Think of what follows; think that at the worst</a>

<a id='line_8636'></a>
<a id='line_8637'>“Master,” began I, “that which I behold</a>

<a id='line_8640'></a>
<a id='line_8641'>And he to me: “The grievous quality</a>

<a id='line_8838'>    Humility, and great tumour thou assuagest;</a>
<a id='line_8839'>    But who is he, of whom just now thou spakest?”</a>
<a id='line_8840'></a>
<a id='line_8841'>“That,” he replied, “is Provenzan Salvani,</a>
<a id='line_8842'>    And he is here because he had presumed</a>
<a id='line_8843'>    To bring Siena all into his hands.</a>
<a id='line_8844'></a>
<a id='line_8845'>He has gone thus, and goeth without rest</a>
<a id='line_8846'>    E’er since he died; such money renders back</a>
<a id='line_8847'>    In payment he who is on earth too daring.”</a>
<a id='line_8848'></a>
<a id='line_8849'>And I: “If every spirit who awaits</a>

<a id='line_8852'></a>
<a id='line_8853'>(Unless good orison shall him bestead,)</a>
<a id='line_8854'>    Until as much time as he lived be passed,</a>
<a id='line_8855'>    How was the coming granted him in largess?”</a>
<a id='line_8856'></a>
<a id='line_8857'>“When he in greatest splendour lived,” said he,</a>
<a id='line_8858'>    “Freely upon the Campo of Siena,</a>
<a id='line_8859'>    All shame being laid aside, he placed himself;</a>
<a id='line_8860'></a>

<a id='line_8862'>    Which in the prison-house of Charles he suffered,</a>
<a id='line_8863'>    He brought himself to tremble in each vein.</a>
<a id='line_8864'></a>
<a id='line_8865'>I say no more, and know that I speak darkly;</a>

<a id='line_8877'>Abreast, like oxen going in a yoke,</a>
<a id='line_8878'>    I with that heavy-laden soul went on,</a>

<a id='line_8880'></a>

<a id='line_8956'></a>

<a id='line_8964'></a>

<a id='line_8972'></a>
<a id='line_8973'>More of the mount by us was now encompassed,</a>
<a id='line_8974'>    And far more spent the circuit of the sun,</a>
<a id='line_8975'>    Than had the mind preoccupied imagined,</a>
<a id='line_8976'></a>
<a id='line_8977'>When he, who ever watchful in advance</a>
<a id='line_8978'>    Was going on, began: “Lift up thy head,</a>
<a id='line_8979'>    ’Tis no more time to go thus meditating.</a>
<a id='line_8980'></a>
<a id='line_8981'>Lo there an Angel who is making haste</a>

<a id='line_8984'></a>
<a id='line_8985'>With reverence thine acts and looks adorn,</a>
<a id='line_8986'>    So that he may delight to speed us upward;</a>
<a id='line_8987'>    Think that this day will never dawn again.”</a>
<a id='line_8988'></a>
<a id='line_8989'>I was familiar with his admonition</a>
<a id='line_8990'>    Ever to lose no time; so on this theme</a>
<a id='line_8991'>    He could not unto me speak covertly.</a>
<a id='line_8992'></a>
<a id='line_8993'>Towards us came the being beautiful</a>
<a id='line_8994'>    Vested in white, and in his countenance</a>
<a id='line_8995'>    Such as appears the tremulous morning star.</a>
<a id='line_8996'></a>
<a id='line_8997'>His arms he opened, and opened then his wings;</a>
<a id='line_8998'>    “Come,” said he, “near at hand here are the steps,</a>
<a id='line_8999'>    And easy from henceforth is the ascent.”</a>
<a id='line_9000'></a>
<a id='line_9001'>At this announcement few are they who come!</a>
<a id='line_9002'>    O human creatures, born to soar aloft,</a>
<a id='line_9003'>    Why fall ye thus before a little wind?</a>
<a id='line_9004'></a>
<a id='line_9005'>He led us on to where the rock was cleft;</a>
<a id='line_9006'>    There smote upon my forehead with his wings,</a>
<a id='line_9007'>    Then a safe passage promised unto me.</a>
<a id='line_9008'></a>
<a id='line_9009'>As on the right hand, to ascend the mount</a>
<a id='line_9010'>    Where seated is the church that lordeth it</a>
<a id='line_9011'>    O’er the well-guided, above Rubaconte,</a>
<a id='line_9012'></a>
<a id='line_9013'>The bold abruptness of the ascent is broken</a>
<a id='line_9014'>    By stairways that were made there in the age</a>
<a id='line_9015'>    When still were safe the ledger and the stave,</a>
<a id='line_9016'></a>
<a id='line_9017'>E’en thus attempered is the bank which falls</a>
<a id='line_9018'>    Sheer downward from the second circle there;</a>
<a id='line_9019'>    But on this, side and that the high rock graze.</a>
<a id='line_9020'></a>
<a id='line_9021'>As we were turning thitherward our persons,</a>
<a id='line_9022'>    “Beati pauperes spiritu,” voices</a>
<a id='line_9023'>    Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not.</a>
<a id='line_9024'></a>
<a id='line_9025'>Ah me! how different are these entrances</a>
<a id='line_9026'>    From the Infernal! for with anthems here</a>
<a id='line_9027'>    One enters, and below with wild laments.</a>
<a id='line_9028'></a>
<a id='line_9029'>We now were hunting up the sacred stairs,</a>
<a id='line_9030'>    And it appeared to me by far more easy</a>
<a id='line_9031'>    Than on the plain it had appeared before.</a>
<a id='line_9032'></a>
<a id='line_9033'>Whence I: “My Master, say, what heavy thing</a>
<a id='line_9034'>    Has been uplifted from me, so that hardly</a>
<a id='line_9035'>    Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking?”</a>
<a id='line_9036'></a>
<a id='line_9037'>He answered: “When the P’s which have remained</a>
<a id='line_9038'>    Still on thy face almost obliterate</a>
<a id='line_9039'>    Shall wholly, as the first is, be erased,</a>
<a id='line_9040'></a>
<a id='line_9041'>Thy feet will be so vanquished by good will,</a>
<a id='line_9042'>    That not alone they shall not feel fatigue,</a>
<a id='line_9043'>    But urging up will be to them delight.”</a>
<a id='line_9044'></a>
<a id='line_9045'>Then did I even as they do who are going</a>
<a id='line_9046'>    With something on the head to them unknown,</a>
<a id='line_9047'>    Unless the signs of others make them doubt,</a>
<a id='line_9048'></a>
<a id='line_9049'>Wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful,</a>
<a id='line_9050'>    And seeks and finds, and doth fulfill the office</a>
<a id='line_9051'>    Which cannot be accomplished by the sight;</a>
<a id='line_9052'></a>
<a id='line_9053'>And with the fingers of the right hand spread</a>
<a id='line_9054'>    I found but six the letters, that had carved</a>
<a id='line_9055'>    Upon my temples he who bore the keys;</a>
<a id='line_9056'></a>
<a id='line_9057'>Upon beholding which my Leader smiled.</a>
<a id='line_9058'></a>
<a id='line_9059'></a>
<a id='line_9060'></a>
<a id='line_9061'></a>
<a id='line_9062'>Purgatorio: Canto XIII</a>
<a id='line_9063'></a>
<a id='line_9064'></a>
<a id='line_9065'>We were upon the summit of the stairs,</a>
<a id='line_9066'>    Where for the second time is cut away</a>
<a id='line_9067'>    The mountain, which ascending shriveth all.</a>
<a id='line_9068'></a>
<a id='line_9069'>There in like manner doth a cornice bind</a>
<a id='line_9070'>    The hill all round about, as does the first,</a>
<a id='line_9071'>    Save that its arc more suddenly is curved.</a>
<a id='line_9072'></a>
<a id='line_9073'>Shade is there none, nor sculpture that appears;</a>
<a id='line_9074'>    So seems the bank, and so the road seems smooth,</a>
<a id='line_9075'>    With but the livid colour of the stone.</a>
<a id='line_9076'></a>
<a id='line_9077'>“If to inquire we wait for people here,”</a>
<a id='line_9078'>    The Poet said, “I fear that peradventure</a>
<a id='line_9079'>    Too much delay will our election have.”</a>
<a id='line_9080'></a>
<a id='line_9081'>Then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed,</a>
<a id='line_9082'>    Made his right side the centre of his motion,</a>
<a id='line_9083'>    And turned the left part of himself about.</a>
<a id='line_9084'></a>
<a id='line_9085'>“O thou sweet light! with trust in whom I enter</a>
<a id='line_9086'>    Upon this novel journey, do thou lead us,”</a>
<a id='line_9087'>    Said he, “as one within here should be led.</a>
<a id='line_9088'></a>
<a id='line_9089'>Thou warmest the world, thou shinest over it;</a>
<a id='line_9090'>    If other reason prompt not otherwise,</a>
<a id='line_9091'>    Thy rays should evermore our leaders be!”</a>
<a id='line_9092'></a>
<a id='line_9093'>As much as here is counted for a mile,</a>
<a id='line_9094'>    So much already there had we advanced</a>
<a id='line_9095'>    In little time, by dint of ready will;</a>
<a id='line_9096'></a>
<a id='line_9097'>And tow’rds us there were heard to fly, albeit</a>
<a id='line_9098'>    They were not visible, spirits uttering</a>
<a id='line_9099'>    Unto Love’s table courteous invitations,</a>
<a id='line_9100'></a>
<a id='line_9101'>The first voice that passed onward in its flight,</a>
<a id='line_9102'>    “Vinum non habent,” said in accents loud,</a>
<a id='line_9103'>    And went reiterating it behind us.</a>
<a id='line_9104'></a>
<a id='line_9105'>And ere it wholly grew inaudible</a>
<a id='line_9106'>    Because of distance, passed another, crying,</a>
<a id='line_9107'>    “I am Orestes!” and it also stayed not.</a>
<a id='line_9108'></a>
<a id='line_9109'>“O,” said I, “Father, these, what voices are they?”</a>
<a id='line_9110'>    And even as I asked, behold the third,</a>
<a id='line_9111'>    Saying: “Love those from whom ye have had evil!”</a>
<a id='line_9112'></a>
<a id='line_9113'>And the good Master said: “This circle scourges</a>
<a id='line_9114'>    The sin of envy, and on that account</a>
<a id='line_9115'>    Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge.</a>
<a id='line_9116'></a>
<a id='line_9117'>The bridle of another sound shall be;</a>
<a id='line_9118'>    I think that thou wilt hear it, as I judge,</a>
<a id='line_9119'>    Before thou comest to the Pass of Pardon.</a>
<a id='line_9120'></a>
<a id='line_9121'>But fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast,</a>
<a id='line_9122'>    And people thou wilt see before us sitting,</a>
<a id='line_9123'>    And each one close against the cliff is seated.”</a>
<a id='line_9124'></a>
<a id='line_9125'>Then wider than at first mine eyes I opened;</a>
<a id='line_9126'>    I looked before me, and saw shades with mantles</a>
<a id='line_9127'>    Not from the colour of the stone diverse.</a>
<a id='line_9128'></a>
<a id='line_9129'>And when we were a little farther onward,</a>
<a id='line_9130'>    I heard a cry of, “Mary, pray for us!”</a>
<a id='line_9131'>    A cry of, “Michael, Peter, and all Saints!”</a>
<a id='line_9132'></a>
<a id='line_9133'>I do not think there walketh still on earth</a>
<a id='line_9134'>    A man so hard, that he would not be pierced</a>
<a id='line_9135'>    With pity at what afterward I saw.</a>
<a id='line_9136'></a>
<a id='line_9137'>For when I had approached so near to them</a>
<a id='line_9138'>    That manifest to me their acts became,</a>
<a id='line_9139'>    Drained was I at the eyes by heavy grief.</a>
<a id='line_9140'></a>
<a id='line_9141'>Covered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me,</a>
<a id='line_9142'>    And one sustained the other with his shoulder,</a>
<a id='line_9143'>    And all of them were by the bank sustained.</a>
<a id='line_9144'></a>
<a id='line_9145'>Thus do the blind, in want of livelihood,</a>
<a id='line_9146'>    Stand at the doors of churches asking alms,</a>
<a id='line_9147'>    And one upon another leans his head,</a>
<a id='line_9148'></a>
<a id='line_9149'>So that in others pity soon may rise,</a>
<a id='line_9150'>    Not only at the accent of their words,</a>
<a id='line_9151'>    But at their aspect, which no less implores.</a>
<a id='line_9152'></a>
<a id='line_9153'>And as unto the blind the sun comes not,</a>
<a id='line_9154'>    So to the shades, of whom just now I spake,</a>
<a id='line_9155'>    Heaven’s light will not be bounteous of itself;</a>
<a id='line_9156'></a>
<a id='line_9157'>For all their lids an iron wire transpierces,</a>
<a id='line_9158'>    And sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild</a>
<a id='line_9159'>    Is done, because it will not quiet stay.</a>
<a id='line_9160'></a>
<a id='line_9161'>To me it seemed, in passing, to do outrage,</a>
<a id='line_9162'>    Seeing the others without being seen;</a>
<a id='line_9163'>    Wherefore I turned me to my counsel sage.</a>
<a id='line_9164'></a>
<a id='line_9165'>Well knew he what the mute one wished to say,</a>
<a id='line_9166'>    And therefore waited not for my demand,</a>
<a id='line_9167'>    But said: “Speak, and be brief, and to the point.”</a>
<a id='line_9168'></a>
<a id='line_9169'>I had Virgilius upon that side</a>
<a id='line_9170'>    Of the embankment from which one may fall,</a>
<a id='line_9171'>    Since by no border ’tis engarlanded;</a>
<a id='line_9172'></a>
<a id='line_9173'>Upon the other side of me I had</a>
<a id='line_9174'>    The shades devout, who through the horrible seam</a>
<a id='line_9175'>    Pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks.</a>
<a id='line_9176'></a>
<a id='line_9177'>To them I turned me, and, “O people, certain,”</a>
<a id='line_9178'>    Began I, “of beholding the high light,</a>
<a id='line_9179'>    Which your desire has solely in its care,</a>
<a id='line_9180'></a>
<a id='line_9181'>So may grace speedily dissolve the scum</a>

<a id='line_9192'></a>
<a id='line_9193'>By way of answer this I seemed to hear</a>
<a id='line_9194'>    A little farther on than where I stood,</a>
<a id='line_9195'>    Whereat I made myself still nearer heard.</a>
<a id='line_9196'></a>
<a id='line_9197'>Among the rest I saw a shade that waited</a>
<a id='line_9198'>    In aspect, and should any one ask how,</a>
<a id='line_9199'>    Its chin it lifted upward like a blind man.</a>
<a id='line_9200'></a>
<a id='line_9201'>“Spirit,” I said, “who stoopest to ascend,</a>

<a id='line_9209'>Sapient I was not, although I Sapia</a>

<a id='line_9211'>    More happy far than at my own good fortune.</a>
<a id='line_9212'></a>
<a id='line_9213'>And that thou mayst not think that I deceive thee,</a>
<a id='line_9214'>    Hear if I was as foolish as I tell thee.</a>
<a id='line_9215'>    The arc already of my years descending,</a>
<a id='line_9216'></a>
<a id='line_9217'>My fellow-citizens near unto Colle</a>
<a id='line_9218'>    Were joined in battle with their adversaries,</a>
<a id='line_9219'>    And I was praying God for what he willed.</a>
<a id='line_9220'></a>
<a id='line_9221'>Routed were they, and turned into the bitter</a>
<a id='line_9222'>    Passes of flight; and I, the chase beholding,</a>
<a id='line_9223'>    A joy received unequalled by all others;</a>
<a id='line_9224'></a>
<a id='line_9225'>So that I lifted upward my bold face</a>
<a id='line_9226'>    Crying to God, ‘Henceforth I fear thee not,’</a>
<a id='line_9227'>    As did the blackbird at the little sunshine.</a>
<a id='line_9228'></a>
<a id='line_9229'>Peace I desired with God at the extreme</a>
<a id='line_9230'>    Of my existence, and as yet would not</a>
<a id='line_9231'>    My debt have been by penitence discharged,</a>
<a id='line_9232'></a>

<a id='line_9240'></a>
<a id='line_9241'>“Mine eyes,” I said, “will yet be here ta’en from me,</a>
<a id='line_9242'>    But for short space; for small is the offence</a>
<a id='line_9243'>    Committed by their being turned with envy.</a>
<a id='line_9244'></a>
<a id='line_9245'>Far greater is the fear, wherein suspended</a>

<a id='line_9248'></a>
<a id='line_9249'>And she to me: “Who led thee, then, among us</a>
<a id='line_9250'>    Up here, if to return below thou thinkest?”</a>
<a id='line_9251'>    And I: “He who is with me, and speaks not;</a>
<a id='line_9252'></a>
<a id='line_9253'>And living am I; therefore ask of me,</a>
<a id='line_9254'>    Spirit elect, if thou wouldst have me move</a>

<a id='line_9256'></a>
<a id='line_9257'>“O, this is such a novel thing to hear,”</a>
<a id='line_9258'>    She answered, “that great sign it is God loves thee;</a>
<a id='line_9259'>    Therefore with prayer of thine sometimes assist me.</a>
<a id='line_9260'></a>
<a id='line_9261'>And I implore, by what thou most desirest,</a>

<a id='line_9265'>Them wilt thou see among that people vain</a>
<a id='line_9266'>    Who hope in Talamone, and will lose there</a>
<a id='line_9267'>    More hope than in discovering the Diana;</a>
<a id='line_9268'></a>
<a id='line_9269'>But there still more the admirals will lose.”</a>

<a id='line_9274'>Purgatorio: Canto XIV</a>
<a id='line_9275'></a>
<a id='line_9276'></a>
<a id='line_9277'>“Who is this one that goes about our mountain,</a>
<a id='line_9278'>    Or ever Death has given him power of flight,</a>
<a id='line_9279'>    And opes his eyes and shuts them at his will?”</a>
<a id='line_9280'></a>
<a id='line_9281'>“I know not who, but know he’s not alone;</a>
<a id='line_9282'>    Ask him thyself, for thou art nearer to him,</a>
<a id='line_9283'>    And gently, so that he may speak, accost him.”</a>
<a id='line_9284'></a>
<a id='line_9285'>Thus did two spirits, leaning tow’rds each other,</a>
<a id='line_9286'>    Discourse about me there on the right hand;</a>
<a id='line_9287'>    Then held supine their faces to address me.</a>
<a id='line_9288'></a>
<a id='line_9289'>And said the one: “O soul, that, fastened still</a>
<a id='line_9290'>    Within the body, tow’rds the heaven art going,</a>
<a id='line_9291'>    For charity console us, and declare</a>
<a id='line_9292'></a>
<a id='line_9293'>Whence comest and who art thou; for thou mak’st us</a>
<a id='line_9294'>    As much to marvel at this grace of thine</a>
<a id='line_9295'>    As must a thing that never yet has been.”</a>
<a id='line_9296'></a>
<a id='line_9297'>And I: “Through midst of Tuscany there wanders</a>
<a id='line_9298'>    A streamlet that is born in Falterona,</a>
<a id='line_9299'>    And not a hundred miles of course suffice it;</a>
<a id='line_9300'></a>
<a id='line_9301'>From thereupon do I this body bring.</a>
<a id='line_9302'>    To tell you who I am were speech in vain,</a>
<a id='line_9303'>    Because my name as yet makes no great noise.”</a>
<a id='line_9304'></a>
<a id='line_9305'>“If well thy meaning I can penetrate</a>
<a id='line_9306'>    With intellect of mine,” then answered me</a>
<a id='line_9307'>    He who first spake, “thou speakest of the Arno.”</a>
<a id='line_9308'></a>
<a id='line_9309'>And said the other to him: “Why concealed</a>
<a id='line_9310'>    This one the appellation of that river,</a>
<a id='line_9311'>    Even as a man doth of things horrible?”</a>
<a id='line_9312'></a>
<a id='line_9313'>And thus the shade that questioned was of this</a>
<a id='line_9314'>    Himself acquitted: “I know not; but truly</a>
<a id='line_9315'>    ’Tis fit the name of such a valley perish;</a>
<a id='line_9316'></a>
<a id='line_9317'>For from its fountain-head (where is so pregnant</a>

<a id='line_9319'>    That in few places it that mark surpasses)</a>
<a id='line_9320'></a>
<a id='line_9321'>To where it yields itself in restoration</a>
<a id='line_9322'>    Of what the heaven doth of the sea dry up,</a>
<a id='line_9323'>    Whence have the rivers that which goes with them,</a>
<a id='line_9324'></a>
<a id='line_9325'>Virtue is like an enemy avoided</a>
<a id='line_9326'>    By all, as is a serpent, through misfortune</a>
<a id='line_9327'>    Of place, or through bad habit that impels them;</a>
<a id='line_9328'></a>
<a id='line_9329'>On which account have so transformed their nature</a>
<a id='line_9330'>    The dwellers in that miserable valley,</a>
<a id='line_9331'>    It seems that Circe had them in her pasture.</a>
<a id='line_9332'></a>
<a id='line_9333'>’Mid ugly swine, of acorns worthier</a>

<a id='line_9336'></a>
<a id='line_9337'>Curs findeth it thereafter, coming downward,</a>
<a id='line_9338'>    More snarling than their puissance demands,</a>
<a id='line_9339'>    And turns from them disdainfully its muzzle.</a>
<a id='line_9340'></a>
<a id='line_9341'>It goes on falling, and the more it grows,</a>
<a id='line_9342'>    The more it finds the dogs becoming wolves,</a>
<a id='line_9343'>    This maledict and misadventurous ditch.</a>
<a id='line_9344'></a>
<a id='line_9345'>Descended then through many a hollow gulf,</a>
<a id='line_9346'>    It finds the foxes so replete with fraud,</a>
<a id='line_9347'>    They fear no cunning that may master them.</a>
<a id='line_9348'></a>
<a id='line_9349'>Nor will I cease because another hears me;</a>
<a id='line_9350'>    And well ’twill be for him, if still he mind him</a>
<a id='line_9351'>    Of what a truthful spirit to me unravels.</a>
<a id='line_9352'></a>
<a id='line_9353'>Thy grandson I behold, who doth become</a>
<a id='line_9354'>    A hunter of those wolves upon the bank</a>
<a id='line_9355'>    Of the wild stream, and terrifies them all.</a>
<a id='line_9356'></a>
<a id='line_9357'>He sells their flesh, it being yet alive;</a>
<a id='line_9358'>    Thereafter slaughters them like ancient beeves;</a>
<a id='line_9359'>    Many of life, himself of praise, deprives.</a>
<a id='line_9360'></a>
<a id='line_9361'>Blood-stained he issues from the dismal forest;</a>
<a id='line_9362'>    He leaves it such, a thousand years from now</a>
<a id='line_9363'>    In its primeval state ’tis not re-wooded.”</a>
<a id='line_9364'></a>
<a id='line_9365'>As at the announcement of impending ills</a>
<a id='line_9366'>    The face of him who listens is disturbed,</a>
<a id='line_9367'>    From whate’er side the peril seize upon him;</a>
<a id='line_9368'></a>
<a id='line_9369'>So I beheld that other soul, which stood</a>
<a id='line_9370'>    Turned round to listen, grow disturbed and sad,</a>
<a id='line_9371'>    When it had gathered to itself the word.</a>
<a id='line_9372'></a>
<a id='line_9373'>The speech of one and aspect of the other</a>
<a id='line_9374'>    Had me desirous made to know their names,</a>
<a id='line_9375'>    And question mixed with prayers I made thereof,</a>
<a id='line_9376'></a>
<a id='line_9377'>Whereat the spirit which first spake to me</a>
<a id='line_9378'>    Began again: “Thou wishest I should bring me</a>
<a id='line_9379'>    To do for thee what thou’lt not do for me;</a>
<a id='line_9380'></a>
<a id='line_9381'>But since God willeth that in thee shine forth</a>
<a id='line_9382'>    Such grace of his, I’ll not be chary with thee;</a>
<a id='line_9383'>    Know, then, that I Guido del Duca am.</a>
<a id='line_9384'></a>
<a id='line_9385'>My blood was so with envy set on fire,</a>
<a id='line_9386'>    That if I had beheld a man make merry,</a>
<a id='line_9387'>    Thou wouldst have seen me sprinkled o’er with pallor.</a>
<a id='line_9388'></a>
<a id='line_9389'>From my own sowing such the straw I reap!</a>
<a id='line_9390'>    O human race! why dost thou set thy heart</a>

<a id='line_9392'></a>
<a id='line_9393'>This is Renier; this is the boast and honour</a>
<a id='line_9394'>    Of the house of Calboli, where no one since</a>
<a id='line_9395'>    Has made himself the heir of his desert.</a>
<a id='line_9396'></a>

<a id='line_9402'>    Of venomous roots, so that too tardily</a>
<a id='line_9403'>    By cultivation now would they diminish.</a>
<a id='line_9404'></a>
<a id='line_9405'>Where is good Lizio, and Arrigo Manardi,</a>
<a id='line_9406'>    Pier Traversaro, and Guido di Carpigna,</a>

<a id='line_9412'></a>
<a id='line_9413'>Be not astonished, Tuscan, if I weep,</a>
<a id='line_9414'>    When I remember, with Guido da Prata,</a>

<a id='line_9424'></a>
<a id='line_9425'>O Brettinoro! why dost thou not flee,</a>

<a id='line_9428'></a>
<a id='line_9429'>Bagnacaval does well in not begetting</a>
<a id='line_9430'>    And ill does Castrocaro, and Conio worse,</a>

<a id='line_9432'></a>
<a id='line_9433'>Will do well the Pagani, when their Devil</a>

<a id='line_9442'>    To weep far better than it does to speak,</a>
<a id='line_9443'>    So much has our discourse my mind distressed.”</a>
<a id='line_9444'></a>
<a id='line_9445'>We were aware that those beloved souls</a>
<a id='line_9446'>    Heard us depart; therefore, by keeping silent,</a>
<a id='line_9447'>    They made us of our pathway confident.</a>
<a id='line_9448'></a>
<a id='line_9449'>When we became alone by going onward,</a>
<a id='line_9450'>    Thunder, when it doth cleave the air, appeared</a>
<a id='line_9451'>    A voice, that counter to us came, exclaiming:</a>
<a id='line_9452'></a>
<a id='line_9453'>“Shall slay me whosoever findeth me!”</a>
<a id='line_9454'>    And fled as the reverberation dies</a>
<a id='line_9455'>    If suddenly the cloud asunder bursts.</a>
<a id='line_9456'></a>
<a id='line_9457'>As soon as hearing had a truce from this,</a>
<a id='line_9458'>    Behold another, with so great a crash,</a>
<a id='line_9459'>    That it resembled thunderings following fast:</a>
<a id='line_9460'></a>
<a id='line_9461'>“I am Aglaurus, who became a stone!”</a>
<a id='line_9462'>    And then, to press myself close to the Poet,</a>
<a id='line_9463'>    I backward, and not forward, took a step.</a>
<a id='line_9464'></a>
<a id='line_9465'>Already on all sides the air was quiet;</a>
<a id='line_9466'>    And said he to me: “That was the hard curb</a>
<a id='line_9467'>    That ought to hold a man within his bounds;</a>
<a id='line_9468'></a>
<a id='line_9469'>But you take in the bait so that the hook</a>
<a id='line_9470'>    Of the old Adversary draws you to him,</a>
<a id='line_9471'>    And hence availeth little curb or call.</a>
<a id='line_9472'></a>
<a id='line_9473'>The heavens are calling you, and wheel around you,</a>

<a id='line_9483'></a>
<a id='line_9484'></a>
<a id='line_9485'>As much as ’twixt the close of the third hour</a>
<a id='line_9486'>    And dawn of day appeareth of that sphere</a>
<a id='line_9487'>    Which aye in fashion of a child is playing,</a>
<a id='line_9488'></a>
<a id='line_9489'>So much it now appeared, towards the night,</a>

<a id='line_9491'>    There it was evening, and ’twas midnight here;</a>
<a id='line_9492'></a>
<a id='line_9493'>And the rays smote the middle of our faces,</a>
<a id='line_9494'>    Because by us the mount was so encircled,</a>
<a id='line_9495'>    That straight towards the west we now were going</a>
<a id='line_9496'></a>
<a id='line_9497'>When I perceived my forehead overpowered</a>

<a id='line_9499'>    And stupor were to me the things unknown,</a>
<a id='line_9500'></a>
<a id='line_9501'>Whereat towards the summit of my brow</a>
<a id='line_9502'>    I raised my hands, and made myself the visor</a>
<a id='line_9503'>    Which the excessive glare diminishes.</a>
<a id='line_9504'></a>
<a id='line_9505'>As when from off the water, or a mirror,</a>
<a id='line_9506'>    The sunbeam leaps unto the opposite side,</a>
<a id='line_9507'>    Ascending upward in the selfsame measure</a>

<a id='line_9512'></a>
<a id='line_9513'>So it appeared to me that by a light</a>
<a id='line_9514'>    Refracted there before me I was smitten;</a>

<a id='line_9520'></a>
<a id='line_9521'>“Marvel thou not, if dazzle thee as yet</a>
<a id='line_9522'>    The family of heaven,” he answered me;</a>
<a id='line_9523'>    “An angel ’tis, who comes to invite us upward.</a>
<a id='line_9524'></a>
<a id='line_9525'>Soon will it be, that to behold these things</a>
<a id='line_9526'>    Shall not be grievous, but delightful to thee</a>
<a id='line_9527'>    As much as nature fashioned thee to feel.”</a>
<a id='line_9528'></a>
<a id='line_9529'>When we had reached the Angel benedight,</a>
<a id='line_9530'>    With joyful voice he said: “Here enter in</a>
<a id='line_9531'>    To stairway far less steep than are the others.”</a>
<a id='line_9532'></a>
<a id='line_9533'>We mounting were, already thence departed,</a>
<a id='line_9534'>    And “Beati misericordes” was</a>
<a id='line_9535'>    Behind us sung, “Rejoice, thou that o’ercomest!”</a>
<a id='line_9536'></a>
<a id='line_9537'>My Master and myself, we two alone</a>
<a id='line_9538'>    Were going upward, and I thought, in going,</a>
<a id='line_9539'>    Some profit to acquire from words of his;</a>
<a id='line_9540'></a>
<a id='line_9541'>And I to him directed me, thus asking:</a>
<a id='line_9542'>    “What did the spirit of Romagna mean,</a>
<a id='line_9543'>    Mentioning interdict and partnership?”</a>
<a id='line_9544'></a>
<a id='line_9545'>Whence he to me: “Of his own greatest failing</a>
<a id='line_9546'>    He knows the harm; and therefore wonder not</a>
<a id='line_9547'>    If he reprove us, that we less may rue it.</a>
<a id='line_9548'></a>
<a id='line_9549'>Because are thither pointed your desires</a>
<a id='line_9550'>    Where by companionship each share is lessened,</a>
<a id='line_9551'>    Envy doth ply the bellows to your sighs.</a>
<a id='line_9552'></a>
<a id='line_9553'>But if the love of the supernal sphere</a>
<a id='line_9554'>    Should upwardly direct your aspiration,</a>
<a id='line_9555'>    There would not be that fear within your breast;</a>
<a id='line_9556'></a>
<a id='line_9557'>For there, as much the more as one says ‘Our,’</a>
<a id='line_9558'>    So much the more of good each one possesses,</a>
<a id='line_9559'>    And more of charity in that cloister burns.”</a>
<a id='line_9560'></a>
<a id='line_9561'>“I am more hungering to be satisfied,”</a>
<a id='line_9562'>    I said, “than if I had before been silent,</a>
<a id='line_9563'>    And more of doubt within my mind I gather.</a>
<a id='line_9564'></a>
<a id='line_9565'>How can it be, that boon distributed</a>
<a id='line_9566'>    The more possessors can more wealthy make</a>
<a id='line_9567'>    Therein, than if by few it be possessed?”</a>
<a id='line_9568'></a>
<a id='line_9569'>And he to me: “Because thou fixest still</a>
<a id='line_9570'>    Thy mind entirely upon earthly things,</a>
<a id='line_9571'>    Thou pluckest darkness from the very light.</a>
<a id='line_9572'></a>
<a id='line_9573'>That goodness infinite and ineffable</a>
<a id='line_9574'>    Which is above there, runneth unto love,</a>
<a id='line_9575'>    As to a lucid body comes the sunbeam.</a>
<a id='line_9576'></a>
<a id='line_9577'>So much it gives itself as it finds ardour,</a>
<a id='line_9578'>    So that as far as charity extends,</a>
<a id='line_9579'>    O’er it increases the eternal valour.</a>
<a id='line_9580'></a>
<a id='line_9581'>And the more people thitherward aspire,</a>
<a id='line_9582'>    More are there to love well, and more they love there,</a>
<a id='line_9583'>    And, as a mirror, one reflects the other.</a>
<a id='line_9584'></a>
<a id='line_9585'>And if my reasoning appease thee not,</a>
<a id='line_9586'>    Thou shalt see Beatrice; and she will fully</a>
<a id='line_9587'>    Take from thee this and every other longing.</a>
<a id='line_9588'></a>
<a id='line_9589'>Endeavour, then, that soon may be extinct,</a>
<a id='line_9590'>    As are the two already, the five wounds</a>
<a id='line_9591'>    That close themselves again by being painful.”</a>
<a id='line_9592'></a>
<a id='line_9593'>Even as I wished to say, “Thou dost appease me,”</a>
<a id='line_9594'>    I saw that I had reached another circle,</a>
<a id='line_9595'>    So that my eager eyes made me keep silence.</a>
<a id='line_9596'></a>
<a id='line_9597'>There it appeared to me that in a vision</a>
<a id='line_9598'>    Ecstatic on a sudden I was rapt,</a>
<a id='line_9599'>    And in a temple many persons saw;</a>
<a id='line_9600'></a>
<a id='line_9601'>And at the door a woman, with the sweet</a>
<a id='line_9602'>    Behaviour of a mother, saying: “Son,</a>
<a id='line_9603'>    Why in this manner hast thou dealt with us?</a>
<a id='line_9604'></a>
<a id='line_9605'>Lo, sorrowing, thy father and myself</a>
<a id='line_9606'>    Were seeking for thee;”—and as here she ceased,</a>
<a id='line_9607'>    That which appeared at first had disappeared.</a>
<a id='line_9608'></a>
<a id='line_9609'>Then I beheld another with those waters</a>
<a id='line_9610'>    Adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever</a>
<a id='line_9611'>    From great disdain of others it is born,</a>
<a id='line_9612'></a>
<a id='line_9613'>And saying: “If of that city thou art lord,</a>
<a id='line_9614'>    For whose name was such strife among the gods,</a>
<a id='line_9615'>    And whence doth every science scintillate,</a>
<a id='line_9616'></a>
<a id='line_9617'>Avenge thyself on those audacious arms</a>
<a id='line_9618'>    That clasped our daughter, O Pisistratus;”</a>
<a id='line_9619'>    And the lord seemed to me benign and mild</a>
<a id='line_9620'></a>
<a id='line_9621'>To answer her with aspect temperate:</a>
<a id='line_9622'>    “What shall we do to those who wish us ill,</a>
<a id='line_9623'>    If he who loves us be by us condemned?”</a>
<a id='line_9624'></a>
<a id='line_9625'>Then saw I people hot in fire of wrath,</a>
<a id='line_9626'>    With stones a young man slaying, clamorously</a>
<a id='line_9627'>    Still crying to each other, “Kill him! kill him!”</a>
<a id='line_9628'></a>
<a id='line_9629'>And him I saw bow down, because of death</a>
<a id='line_9630'>    That weighed already on him, to the earth,</a>
<a id='line_9631'>    But of his eyes made ever gates to heaven,</a>
<a id='line_9632'></a>
<a id='line_9633'>Imploring the high Lord, in so great strife,</a>
<a id='line_9634'>    That he would pardon those his persecutors,</a>
<a id='line_9635'>    With such an aspect as unlocks compassion.</a>
<a id='line_9636'></a>
<a id='line_9637'>Soon as my soul had outwardly returned</a>
<a id='line_9638'>    To things external to it which are true,</a>
<a id='line_9639'>    Did I my not false errors recognize.</a>
<a id='line_9640'></a>
<a id='line_9641'>My Leader, who could see me bear myself</a>
<a id='line_9642'>    Like to a man that rouses him from sleep,</a>
<a id='line_9643'>    Exclaimed: “What ails thee, that thou canst not stand?</a>
<a id='line_9644'></a>
<a id='line_9645'>But hast been coming more than half a league</a>
<a id='line_9646'>    Veiling thine eyes, and with thy legs entangled,</a>
<a id='line_9647'>    In guise of one whom wine or sleep subdues?”</a>
<a id='line_9648'></a>
<a id='line_9649'>“O my sweet Father, if thou listen to me,</a>
<a id='line_9650'>    I’ll tell thee,” said I, “what appeared to me,</a>
<a id='line_9651'>    When thus from me my legs were ta’en away.”</a>
<a id='line_9652'></a>
<a id='line_9653'>And he: “If thou shouldst have a hundred masks</a>
<a id='line_9654'>    Upon thy face, from me would not be shut</a>
<a id='line_9655'>    Thy cogitations, howsoever small.</a>
<a id='line_9656'></a>
<a id='line_9657'>What thou hast seen was that thou mayst not fail</a>
<a id='line_9658'>    To ope thy heart unto the waters of peace,</a>
<a id='line_9659'>    Which from the eternal fountain are diffused.</a>
<a id='line_9660'></a>
<a id='line_9661'>I did not ask, ‘What ails thee?’ as he does</a>
<a id='line_9662'>    Who only looketh with the eyes that see not</a>
<a id='line_9663'>    When of the soul bereft the body lies,</a>
<a id='line_9664'></a>
<a id='line_9665'>But asked it to give vigour to thy feet;</a>
<a id='line_9666'>    Thus must we needs urge on the sluggards, slow</a>
<a id='line_9667'>    To use their wakefulness when it returns.”</a>
<a id='line_9668'></a>
<a id='line_9669'>We passed along, athwart the twilight peering</a>
<a id='line_9670'>    Forward as far as ever eye could stretch</a>
<a id='line_9671'>    Against the sunbeams serotine and lucent;</a>
<a id='line_9672'></a>
<a id='line_9673'>And lo! by slow degrees a smoke approached</a>
<a id='line_9674'>    In our direction, sombre as the night,</a>
<a id='line_9675'>    Nor was there place to hide one’s self therefrom.</a>
<a id='line_9676'></a>
<a id='line_9677'>This of our eyes and the pure air bereft us.</a>
<a id='line_9678'></a>
<a id='line_9679'></a>
<a id='line_9680'></a>
<a id='line_9681'></a>
<a id='line_9682'>Purgatorio: Canto XVI</a>
<a id='line_9683'></a>
<a id='line_9684'></a>
<a id='line_9685'>Darkness of hell, and of a night deprived</a>
<a id='line_9686'>    Of every planet under a poor sky,</a>
<a id='line_9687'>    As much as may be tenebrous with cloud,</a>
<a id='line_9688'></a>
<a id='line_9689'>Ne’er made unto my sight so thick a veil,</a>
<a id='line_9690'>    As did that smoke which there enveloped us,</a>
<a id='line_9691'>    Nor to the feeling of so rough a texture;</a>
<a id='line_9692'></a>
<a id='line_9693'>For not an eye it suffered to stay open;</a>
<a id='line_9694'>    Whereat mine escort, faithful and sagacious,</a>
<a id='line_9695'>    Drew near to me and offered me his shoulder.</a>
<a id='line_9696'></a>
<a id='line_9697'>E’en as a blind man goes behind his guide,</a>
<a id='line_9698'>    Lest he should wander, or should strike against</a>
<a id='line_9699'>    Aught that may harm or peradventure kill him,</a>
<a id='line_9700'></a>
<a id='line_9701'>So went I through the bitter and foul air,</a>
<a id='line_9702'>    Listening unto my Leader, who said only,</a>
<a id='line_9703'>    “Look that from me thou be not separated.”</a>
<a id='line_9704'></a>
<a id='line_9705'>Voices I heard, and every one appeared</a>
<a id='line_9706'>    To supplicate for peace and misericord</a>
<a id='line_9707'>    The Lamb of God who takes away our sins.</a>
<a id='line_9708'></a>
<a id='line_9709'>Still “Agnus Dei” their exordium was;</a>
<a id='line_9710'>    One word there was in all, and metre one,</a>
<a id='line_9711'>    So that all harmony appeared among them.</a>
<a id='line_9712'></a>
<a id='line_9713'>“Master,” I said, “are spirits those I hear?”</a>
<a id='line_9714'>    And he to me: “Thou apprehendest truly,</a>
<a id='line_9715'>    And they the knot of anger go unloosing.”</a>
<a id='line_9716'></a>
<a id='line_9717'>“Now who art thou, that cleavest through our smoke</a>
<a id='line_9718'>    And art discoursing of us even as though</a>
<a id='line_9719'>    Thou didst by calends still divide the time?”</a>
<a id='line_9720'></a>
<a id='line_9721'>After this manner by a voice was spoken;</a>
<a id='line_9722'>    Whereon my Master said: “Do thou reply,</a>
<a id='line_9723'>    And ask if on this side the way go upward.”</a>
<a id='line_9724'></a>
<a id='line_9725'>And I: “O creature that dost cleanse thyself</a>
<a id='line_9726'>    To return beautiful to Him who made thee,</a>
<a id='line_9727'>    Thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me.”</a>
<a id='line_9728'></a>
<a id='line_9729'>“Thee will I follow far as is allowed me,”</a>
<a id='line_9730'>    He answered; “and if smoke prevent our seeing,</a>
<a id='line_9731'>    Hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof.”</a>
<a id='line_9732'></a>
<a id='line_9733'>Thereon began I: “With that swathing band</a>
<a id='line_9734'>    Which death unwindeth am I going upward,</a>
<a id='line_9735'>    And hither came I through the infernal anguish.</a>
<a id='line_9736'></a>
<a id='line_9737'>And if God in his grace has me infolded,</a>
<a id='line_9738'>    So that he wills that I behold his court</a>
<a id='line_9739'>    By method wholly out of modern usage,</a>
<a id='line_9740'></a>
<a id='line_9741'>Conceal not from me who ere death thou wast,</a>
<a id='line_9742'>    But tell it me, and tell me if I go</a>
<a id='line_9743'>    Right for the pass, and be thy words our escort.”</a>
<a id='line_9744'></a>
<a id='line_9745'>“Lombard was I, and I was Marco called;</a>
<a id='line_9746'>    The world I knew, and loved that excellence,</a>
<a id='line_9747'>    At which has each one now unbent his bow.</a>
<a id='line_9748'></a>
<a id='line_9749'>For mounting upward, thou art going right.”</a>
<a id='line_9750'>    Thus he made answer, and subjoined: “I pray thee</a>
<a id='line_9751'>    To pray for me when thou shalt be above.”</a>
<a id='line_9752'></a>
<a id='line_9753'>And I to him: “My faith I pledge to thee</a>
<a id='line_9754'>    To do what thou dost ask me; but am bursting</a>
<a id='line_9755'>    Inly with doubt, unless I rid me of it.</a>
<a id='line_9756'></a>
<a id='line_9757'>First it was simple, and is now made double</a>
<a id='line_9758'>    By thy opinion, which makes certain to me,</a>
<a id='line_9759'>    Here and elsewhere, that which I couple with it.</a>
<a id='line_9760'></a>
<a id='line_9761'>The world forsooth is utterly deserted</a>
<a id='line_9762'>    By every virtue, as thou tellest me,</a>
<a id='line_9763'>    And with iniquity is big and covered;</a>
<a id='line_9764'></a>
<a id='line_9765'>But I beseech thee point me out the cause,</a>
<a id='line_9766'>    That I may see it, and to others show it;</a>
<a id='line_9767'>    For one in the heavens, and here below one puts it.”</a>
<a id='line_9768'></a>
<a id='line_9769'>A sigh profound, that grief forced into Ai!</a>
<a id='line_9770'>    He first sent forth, and then began he: “Brother,</a>
<a id='line_9771'>    The world is blind, and sooth thou comest from it!</a>
<a id='line_9772'></a>
<a id='line_9773'>Ye who are living every cause refer</a>
<a id='line_9774'>    Still upward to the heavens, as if all things</a>
<a id='line_9775'>    They of necessity moved with themselves.</a>
<a id='line_9776'></a>
<a id='line_9777'>If this were so, in you would be destroyed</a>
<a id='line_9778'>    Free will, nor any justice would there be</a>
<a id='line_9779'>    In having joy for good, or grief for evil.</a>
<a id='line_9780'></a>
<a id='line_9781'>The heavens your movements do initiate,</a>
<a id='line_9782'>    I say not all; but granting that I say it,</a>
<a id='line_9783'>    Light has been given you for good and evil,</a>
<a id='line_9784'></a>
<a id='line_9785'>And free volition; which, if some fatigue</a>
<a id='line_9786'>    In the first battles with the heavens it suffers,</a>
<a id='line_9787'>    Afterwards conquers all, if well ’tis nurtured.</a>
<a id='line_9788'></a>
<a id='line_9789'>To greater force and to a better nature,</a>
<a id='line_9790'>    Though free, ye subject are, and that creates</a>
<a id='line_9791'>    The mind in you the heavens have not in charge.</a>
<a id='line_9792'></a>
<a id='line_9793'>Hence, if the present world doth go astray,</a>
<a id='line_9794'>    In you the cause is, be it sought in you;</a>
<a id='line_9795'>    And I therein will now be thy true spy.</a>
<a id='line_9796'></a>
<a id='line_9797'>Forth from the hand of Him, who fondles it</a>
<a id='line_9798'>    Before it is, like to a little girl</a>
<a id='line_9799'>    Weeping and laughing in her childish sport,</a>
<a id='line_9800'></a>
<a id='line_9801'>Issues the simple soul, that nothing knows,</a>
<a id='line_9802'>    Save that, proceeding from a joyous Maker,</a>
<a id='line_9803'>    Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure.</a>
<a id='line_9804'></a>
<a id='line_9805'>Of trivial good at first it tastes the savour;</a>
<a id='line_9806'>    Is cheated by it, and runs after it,</a>
<a id='line_9807'>    If guide or rein turn not aside its love.</a>
<a id='line_9808'></a>
<a id='line_9809'>Hence it behoved laws for a rein to place,</a>
<a id='line_9810'>    Behoved a king to have, who at the least</a>
<a id='line_9811'>    Of the true city should discern the tower.</a>
<a id='line_9812'></a>
<a id='line_9813'>The laws exist, but who sets hand to them?</a>
<a id='line_9814'>    No one; because the shepherd who precedes</a>
<a id='line_9815'>    Can ruminate, but cleaveth not the hoof;</a>
<a id='line_9816'></a>
<a id='line_9817'>Wherefore the people that perceives its guide</a>
<a id='line_9818'>    Strike only at the good for which it hankers,</a>
<a id='line_9819'>    Feeds upon that, and farther seeketh not.</a>
<a id='line_9820'></a>
<a id='line_9821'>Clearly canst thou perceive that evil guidance</a>
<a id='line_9822'>    The cause is that has made the world depraved,</a>
<a id='line_9823'>    And not that nature is corrupt in you.</a>
<a id='line_9824'></a>
<a id='line_9825'>Rome, that reformed the world, accustomed was</a>
<a id='line_9826'>    Two suns to have, which one road and the other,</a>
<a id='line_9827'>    Of God and of the world, made manifest.</a>
<a id='line_9828'></a>
<a id='line_9829'>One has the other quenched, and to the crosier</a>
<a id='line_9830'>    The sword is joined, and ill beseemeth it</a>
<a id='line_9831'>    That by main force one with the other go,</a>
<a id='line_9832'></a>
<a id='line_9833'>Because, being joined, one feareth not the other;</a>
<a id='line_9834'>    If thou believe not, think upon the grain,</a>
<a id='line_9835'>    For by its seed each herb is recognized.</a>
<a id='line_9836'></a>
<a id='line_9837'>In the land laved by Po and Adige,</a>

<a id='line_9842'>    Whoever will abstain, through sense of shame,</a>
<a id='line_9843'>    From speaking with the good, or drawing near them.</a>
<a id='line_9844'></a>
<a id='line_9845'>True, three old men are left, in whom upbraids</a>
<a id='line_9846'>    The ancient age the new, and late they deem it</a>

<a id='line_9856'></a>
<a id='line_9857'>“O Marco mine,” I said, “thou reasonest well;</a>
<a id='line_9858'>    And now discern I why the sons of Levi</a>
<a id='line_9859'>    Have been excluded from the heritage.</a>
<a id='line_9860'></a>
<a id='line_9861'>But what Gherardo is it, who, as sample</a>
<a id='line_9862'>    Of a lost race, thou sayest has remained</a>
<a id='line_9863'>    In reprobation of the barbarous age?”</a>
<a id='line_9864'></a>
<a id='line_9865'>“Either thy speech deceives me, or it tempts me,”</a>
<a id='line_9866'>    He answered me; “for speaking Tuscan to me,</a>
<a id='line_9867'>    It seems of good Gherardo naught thou knowest.</a>
<a id='line_9868'></a>
<a id='line_9869'>By other surname do I know him not,</a>
<a id='line_9870'>    Unless I take it from his daughter Gaia.</a>
<a id='line_9871'>    May God be with you, for I come no farther.</a>
<a id='line_9872'></a>
<a id='line_9873'>Behold the dawn, that through the smoke rays out,</a>
<a id='line_9874'>    Already whitening; and I must depart—</a>
<a id='line_9875'>    Yonder the Angel is—ere he appear.”</a>
<a id='line_9876'></a>
<a id='line_9877'>Thus did he speak, and would no farther hear me.</a>

<a id='line_9883'></a>
<a id='line_9884'></a>
<a id='line_9885'>Remember, Reader, if e’er in the Alps</a>
<a id='line_9886'>    A mist o’ertook thee, through which thou couldst see</a>
<a id='line_9887'>    Not otherwise than through its membrane mole,</a>
<a id='line_9888'></a>
<a id='line_9889'>How, when the vapours humid and condensed</a>
<a id='line_9890'>    Begin to dissipate themselves, the sphere</a>
<a id='line_9891'>    Of the sun feebly enters in among them,</a>
<a id='line_9892'></a>
<a id='line_9893'>And thy imagination will be swift</a>
<a id='line_9894'>    In coming to perceive how I re-saw</a>
<a id='line_9895'>    The sun at first, that was already setting.</a>
<a id='line_9896'></a>
<a id='line_9897'>Thus, to the faithful footsteps of my Master</a>
<a id='line_9898'>    Mating mine own, I issued from that cloud</a>
<a id='line_9899'>    To rays already dead on the low shores.</a>
<a id='line_9900'></a>
<a id='line_9901'>O thou, Imagination, that dost steal us</a>
<a id='line_9902'>    So from without sometimes, that man perceives not,</a>
<a id='line_9903'>    Although around may sound a thousand trumpets,</a>
<a id='line_9904'></a>
<a id='line_9905'>Who moveth thee, if sense impel thee not?</a>
<a id='line_9906'>    Moves thee a light, which in the heaven takes form,</a>
<a id='line_9907'>    By self, or by a will that downward guides it.</a>
<a id='line_9908'></a>
<a id='line_9909'>Of her impiety, who changed her form</a>
<a id='line_9910'>    Into the bird that most delights in singing,</a>
<a id='line_9911'>    In my imagining appeared the trace;</a>
<a id='line_9912'></a>
<a id='line_9913'>And hereupon my mind was so withdrawn</a>
<a id='line_9914'>    Within itself, that from without there came</a>
<a id='line_9915'>    Nothing that then might be received by it.</a>
<a id='line_9916'></a>
<a id='line_9917'>Then reigned within my lofty fantasy</a>
<a id='line_9918'>    One crucified, disdainful and ferocious</a>
<a id='line_9919'>    In countenance, and even thus was dying.</a>
<a id='line_9920'></a>
<a id='line_9921'>Around him were the great Ahasuerus,</a>
<a id='line_9922'>    Esther his wife, and the just Mordecai,</a>
<a id='line_9923'>    Who was in word and action so entire.</a>
<a id='line_9924'></a>
<a id='line_9925'>And even as this image burst asunder</a>
<a id='line_9926'>    Of its own self, in fashion of a bubble</a>
<a id='line_9927'>    In which the water it was made of fails,</a>
<a id='line_9928'></a>
<a id='line_9929'>There rose up in my vision a young maiden</a>
<a id='line_9930'>    Bitterly weeping, and she said: “O queen,</a>
<a id='line_9931'>    Why hast thou wished in anger to be naught?</a>
<a id='line_9932'></a>
<a id='line_9933'>Thou’st slain thyself, Lavinia not to lose;</a>
<a id='line_9934'>    Now hast thou lost me; I am she who mourns,</a>
<a id='line_9935'>    Mother, at thine ere at another’s ruin.”</a>
<a id='line_9936'></a>
<a id='line_9937'>As sleep is broken, when upon a sudden</a>
<a id='line_9938'>    New light strikes in upon the eyelids closed,</a>
<a id='line_9939'>    And broken quivers ere it dieth wholly,</a>
<a id='line_9940'></a>
<a id='line_9941'>So this imagining of mine fell down</a>
<a id='line_9942'>    As soon as the effulgence smote my face,</a>
<a id='line_9943'>    Greater by far than what is in our wont.</a>
<a id='line_9944'></a>
<a id='line_9945'>I turned me round to see where I might be,</a>
<a id='line_9946'>    When said a voice, “Here is the passage up;”</a>
<a id='line_9947'>    Which from all other purposes removed me,</a>
<a id='line_9948'></a>
<a id='line_9949'>And made my wish so full of eagerness</a>
<a id='line_9950'>    To look and see who was it that was speaking,</a>
<a id='line_9951'>    It never rests till meeting face to face;</a>
<a id='line_9952'></a>
<a id='line_9953'>But as before the sun, which quells the sight,</a>
<a id='line_9954'>    And in its own excess its figure veils,</a>
<a id='line_9955'>    Even so my power was insufficient here.</a>
<a id='line_9956'></a>
<a id='line_9957'>“This is a spirit divine, who in the way</a>
<a id='line_9958'>    Of going up directs us without asking,</a>
<a id='line_9959'>    And who with his own light himself conceals.</a>
<a id='line_9960'></a>
<a id='line_9961'>He does with us as man doth with himself;</a>
<a id='line_9962'>    For he who sees the need, and waits the asking,</a>
<a id='line_9963'>    Malignly leans already tow’rds denial.</a>
<a id='line_9964'></a>
<a id='line_9965'>Accord we now our feet to such inviting,</a>
<a id='line_9966'>    Let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark;</a>
<a id='line_9967'>    For then we could not till the day return.”</a>
<a id='line_9968'></a>
<a id='line_9969'>Thus my Conductor said; and I and he</a>
<a id='line_9970'>    Together turned our footsteps to a stairway;</a>
<a id='line_9971'>    And I, as soon as the first step I reached,</a>
<a id='line_9972'></a>
<a id='line_9973'>Near me perceived a motion as of wings,</a>
<a id='line_9974'>    And fanning in the face, and saying, “‘Beati</a>
<a id='line_9975'>    Pacifici,’ who are without ill anger.”</a>
<a id='line_9976'></a>
<a id='line_9977'>Already over us were so uplifted</a>
<a id='line_9978'>    The latest sunbeams, which the night pursues,</a>
<a id='line_9979'>    That upon many sides the stars appeared.</a>
<a id='line_9980'></a>
<a id='line_9981'>“O manhood mine, why dost thou vanish so?”</a>
<a id='line_9982'>    I said within myself; for I perceived</a>
<a id='line_9983'>    The vigour of my legs was put in truce.</a>
<a id='line_9984'></a>
<a id='line_9985'>We at the point were where no more ascends</a>
<a id='line_9986'>    The stairway upward, and were motionless,</a>
<a id='line_9987'>    Even as a ship, which at the shore arrives;</a>
<a id='line_9988'></a>
<a id='line_9989'>And I gave heed a little, if I might hear</a>
<a id='line_9990'>    Aught whatsoever in the circle new;</a>
<a id='line_9991'>    Then to my Master turned me round and said:</a>
<a id='line_9992'></a>
<a id='line_9993'>“Say, my sweet Father, what delinquency</a>
<a id='line_9994'>    Is purged here in the circle where we are?</a>
<a id='line_9995'>    Although our feet may pause, pause not thy speech.”</a>
<a id='line_9996'></a>
<a id='line_9997'>And he to me: “The love of good, remiss</a>
<a id='line_9998'>    In what it should have done, is here restored;</a>
<a id='line_9999'>    Here plied again the ill-belated oar;</a>
<a id='line_10000'></a>
<a id='line_10001'>But still more openly to understand,</a>
<a id='line_10002'>    Turn unto me thy mind, and thou shalt gather</a>
<a id='line_10003'>    Some profitable fruit from our delay.</a>
<a id='line_10004'></a>
<a id='line_10005'>Neither Creator nor a creature ever,</a>
<a id='line_10006'>    Son,” he began, “was destitute of love</a>
<a id='line_10007'>    Natural or spiritual; and thou knowest it.</a>
<a id='line_10008'></a>
<a id='line_10009'>The natural was ever without error;</a>
<a id='line_10010'>    But err the other may by evil object,</a>
<a id='line_10011'>    Or by too much, or by too little vigour.</a>
<a id='line_10012'></a>
<a id='line_10013'>While in the first it well directed is,</a>
<a id='line_10014'>    And in the second moderates itself,</a>
<a id='line_10015'>    It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure;</a>
<a id='line_10016'></a>
<a id='line_10017'>But when to ill it turns, and, with more care</a>
<a id='line_10018'>    Or lesser than it ought, runs after good,</a>
<a id='line_10019'>    ’Gainst the Creator works his own creation.</a>
<a id='line_10020'></a>
<a id='line_10021'>Hence thou mayst comprehend that love must be</a>
<a id='line_10022'>    The seed within yourselves of every virtue,</a>
<a id='line_10023'>    And every act that merits punishment.</a>
<a id='line_10024'></a>
<a id='line_10025'>Now inasmuch as never from the welfare</a>
<a id='line_10026'>    Of its own subject can love turn its sight,</a>
<a id='line_10027'>    From their own hatred all things are secure;</a>
<a id='line_10028'></a>
<a id='line_10029'>And since we cannot think of any being</a>
<a id='line_10030'>    Standing alone, nor from the First divided,</a>
<a id='line_10031'>    Of hating Him is all desire cut off.</a>
<a id='line_10032'></a>
<a id='line_10033'>Hence if, discriminating, I judge well,</a>
<a id='line_10034'>    The evil that one loves is of one’s neighbour,</a>
<a id='line_10035'>    And this is born in three modes in your clay.</a>
<a id='line_10036'></a>
<a id='line_10037'>There are, who, by abasement of their neighbour,</a>
<a id='line_10038'>    Hope to excel, and therefore only long</a>
<a id='line_10039'>    That from his greatness he may be cast down;</a>
<a id='line_10040'></a>
<a id='line_10041'>There are, who power, grace, honour, and renown</a>
<a id='line_10042'>    Fear they may lose because another rises,</a>
<a id='line_10043'>    Thence are so sad that the reverse they love;</a>
<a id='line_10044'></a>
<a id='line_10045'>And there are those whom injury seems to chafe,</a>
<a id='line_10046'>    So that it makes them greedy for revenge,</a>
<a id='line_10047'>    And such must needs shape out another’s harm.</a>
<a id='line_10048'></a>
<a id='line_10049'>This threefold love is wept for down below;</a>
<a id='line_10050'>    Now of the other will I have thee hear,</a>
<a id='line_10051'>    That runneth after good with measure faulty.</a>
<a id='line_10052'></a>
<a id='line_10053'>Each one confusedly a good conceives</a>
<a id='line_10054'>    Wherein the mind may rest, and longeth for it;</a>
<a id='line_10055'>    Therefore to overtake it each one strives.</a>
<a id='line_10056'></a>
<a id='line_10057'>If languid love to look on this attract you,</a>
<a id='line_10058'>    Or in attaining unto it, this cornice,</a>
<a id='line_10059'>    After just penitence, torments you for it.</a>
<a id='line_10060'></a>
<a id='line_10061'>There’s other good that does not make man happy;</a>
<a id='line_10062'>    ’Tis not felicity, ’tis not the good</a>
<a id='line_10063'>    Essence, of every good the fruit and root.</a>
<a id='line_10064'></a>
<a id='line_10065'>The love that yields itself too much to this</a>
<a id='line_10066'>    Above us is lamented in three circles;</a>
<a id='line_10067'>    But how tripartite it may be described,</a>
<a id='line_10068'></a>
<a id='line_10069'>I say not, that thou seek it for thyself.”</a>

<a id='line_10193'>But taken from me was this drowsiness</a>
<a id='line_10194'>    Suddenly by a people, that behind</a>
<a id='line_10195'>    Our backs already had come round to us.</a>
<a id='line_10196'></a>
<a id='line_10197'>And as, of old, Ismenus and Asopus</a>
<a id='line_10198'>    Beside them saw at night the rush and throng,</a>
<a id='line_10199'>    If but the Thebans were in need of Bacchus,</a>
<a id='line_10200'></a>
<a id='line_10201'>So they along that circle curve their step,</a>
<a id='line_10202'>    From what I saw of those approaching us,</a>
<a id='line_10203'>    Who by good-will and righteous love are ridden.</a>
<a id='line_10204'></a>
<a id='line_10205'>Full soon they were upon us, because running</a>
<a id='line_10206'>    Moved onward all that mighty multitude,</a>
<a id='line_10207'>    And two in the advance cried out, lamenting,</a>
<a id='line_10208'></a>
<a id='line_10209'>“Mary in haste unto the mountain ran,</a>
<a id='line_10210'>    And Caesar, that he might subdue Ilerda,</a>
<a id='line_10211'>    Thrust at Marseilles, and then ran into Spain.”</a>
<a id='line_10212'></a>
<a id='line_10213'>“Quick! quick! so that the time may not be lost</a>
<a id='line_10214'>    By little love!” forthwith the others cried,</a>
<a id='line_10215'>    “For ardour in well-doing freshens grace!”</a>
<a id='line_10216'></a>
<a id='line_10217'>“O folk, in whom an eager fervour now</a>
<a id='line_10218'>    Supplies perhaps delay and negligence,</a>
<a id='line_10219'>    Put by you in well-doing, through lukewarmness,</a>
<a id='line_10220'></a>
<a id='line_10221'>This one who lives, and truly I lie not,</a>

<a id='line_10223'>    So tell us where the passage nearest is.”</a>
<a id='line_10224'></a>
<a id='line_10225'>These were the words of him who was my Guide;</a>
<a id='line_10226'>    And some one of those spirits said: “Come on</a>
<a id='line_10227'>    Behind us, and the opening shalt thou find;</a>
<a id='line_10228'></a>
<a id='line_10229'>So full of longing are we to move onward,</a>
<a id='line_10230'>    That stay we cannot; therefore pardon us,</a>
<a id='line_10231'>    If thou for churlishness our justice take.</a>
<a id='line_10232'></a>

<a id='line_10236'></a>
<a id='line_10237'>And he has one foot in the grave already,</a>
<a id='line_10238'>    Who shall erelong lament that monastery,</a>
<a id='line_10239'>    And sorry be of having there had power,</a>
<a id='line_10240'></a>
<a id='line_10241'>Because his son, in his whole body sick,</a>
<a id='line_10242'>    And worse in mind, and who was evil-born,</a>
<a id='line_10243'>    He put into the place of its true pastor.”</a>
<a id='line_10244'></a>
<a id='line_10245'>If more he said, or silent was, I know not,</a>
<a id='line_10246'>    He had already passed so far beyond us;</a>
<a id='line_10247'>    But this I heard, and to retain it pleased me.</a>
<a id='line_10248'></a>
<a id='line_10249'>And he who was in every need my succour</a>
<a id='line_10250'>    Said: “Turn thee hitherward; see two of them</a>
<a id='line_10251'>    Come fastening upon slothfulness their teeth.”</a>
<a id='line_10252'></a>
<a id='line_10253'>In rear of all they shouted: “Sooner were</a>
<a id='line_10254'>    The people dead to whom the sea was opened,</a>
<a id='line_10255'>    Than their inheritors the Jordan saw;</a>
<a id='line_10256'></a>
<a id='line_10257'>And those who the fatigue did not endure</a>
<a id='line_10258'>    Unto the issue, with Anchises’ son,</a>
<a id='line_10259'>    Themselves to life withouten glory offered.”</a>
<a id='line_10260'></a>
<a id='line_10261'>Then when from us so separated were</a>
<a id='line_10262'>    Those shades, that they no longer could be seen,</a>
<a id='line_10263'>    Within me a new thought did entrance find,</a>
<a id='line_10264'></a>
<a id='line_10265'>Whence others many and diverse were born;</a>
<a id='line_10266'>    And so I lapsed from one into another,</a>
<a id='line_10267'>    That in a reverie mine eyes I closed,</a>
<a id='line_10268'></a>
<a id='line_10269'>And meditation into dream transmuted.</a>

<a id='line_10275'></a>
<a id='line_10276'></a>
<a id='line_10277'>It was the hour when the diurnal heat</a>
<a id='line_10278'>    No more can warm the coldness of the moon,</a>

<a id='line_10284'></a>
<a id='line_10285'>There came to me in dreams a stammering woman,</a>
<a id='line_10286'>    Squint in her eyes, and in her feet distorted,</a>
<a id='line_10287'>    With hands dissevered and of sallow hue.</a>
<a id='line_10288'></a>
<a id='line_10289'>I looked at her; and as the sun restores</a>
<a id='line_10290'>    The frigid members which the night benumbs,</a>
<a id='line_10291'>    Even thus my gaze did render voluble</a>
<a id='line_10292'></a>
<a id='line_10293'>Her tongue, and made her all erect thereafter</a>
<a id='line_10294'>    In little while, and the lost countenance</a>
<a id='line_10295'>    As love desires it so in her did colour.</a>
<a id='line_10296'></a>
<a id='line_10297'>When in this wise she had her speech unloosed,</a>
<a id='line_10298'>    She ’gan to sing so, that with difficulty</a>
<a id='line_10299'>    Could I have turned my thoughts away from her.</a>
<a id='line_10300'></a>
<a id='line_10301'>“I am,” she sang, “I am the Siren sweet</a>

<a id='line_10303'>    So full am I of pleasantness to hear.</a>

<a id='line_10308'></a>
<a id='line_10309'>Her mouth was not yet closed again, before</a>
<a id='line_10310'>    Appeared a Lady saintly and alert</a>
<a id='line_10311'>    Close at my side to put her to confusion.</a>
<a id='line_10312'></a>
<a id='line_10313'>“Virgilius, O Virgilius! who is this?”</a>
<a id='line_10314'>    Sternly she said; and he was drawing near</a>
<a id='line_10315'>    With eyes still fixed upon that modest one.</a>
<a id='line_10316'></a>
<a id='line_10317'>She seized the other and in front laid open,</a>
<a id='line_10318'>    Rending her garments, and her belly showed me;</a>
<a id='line_10319'>    This waked me with the stench that issued from it.</a>
<a id='line_10320'></a>
<a id='line_10321'>I turned mine eyes, and good Virgilius said:</a>
<a id='line_10322'>    “At least thrice have I called thee; rise and come;</a>
<a id='line_10323'>    Find we the opening by which thou mayst enter.”</a>
<a id='line_10324'></a>
<a id='line_10325'>I rose; and full already of high day</a>
<a id='line_10326'>    Were all the circles of the Sacred Mountain,</a>

<a id='line_10328'></a>
<a id='line_10329'>Following behind him, I my forehead bore</a>

<a id='line_10332'></a>
<a id='line_10333'>When I heard say, “Come, here the passage is,”</a>
<a id='line_10334'>    Spoken in a manner gentle and benign,</a>
<a id='line_10335'>    Such as we hear not in this mortal region.</a>
<a id='line_10336'></a>
<a id='line_10337'>With open wings, which of a swan appeared,</a>
<a id='line_10338'>    Upward he turned us who thus spake to us,</a>
<a id='line_10339'>    Between the two walls of the solid granite.</a>
<a id='line_10340'></a>
<a id='line_10341'>He moved his pinions afterwards and fanned us,</a>
<a id='line_10342'>    Affirming those ‘qui lugent’ to be blessed,</a>
<a id='line_10343'>    For they shall have their souls with comfort filled.</a>
<a id='line_10344'></a>
<a id='line_10345'>“What aileth thee, that aye to earth thou gazest?”</a>
<a id='line_10346'>    To me my Guide began to say, we both</a>
<a id='line_10347'>    Somewhat beyond the Angel having mounted.</a>
<a id='line_10348'></a>
<a id='line_10349'>And I: “With such misgiving makes me go</a>
<a id='line_10350'>    A vision new, which bends me to itself,</a>
<a id='line_10351'>    So that I cannot from the thought withdraw me.”</a>
<a id='line_10352'></a>
<a id='line_10353'>“Didst thou behold,” he said, “that old enchantress,</a>
<a id='line_10354'>    Who sole above us henceforth is lamented?</a>

<a id='line_10360'></a>
<a id='line_10361'>Even as the hawk, that first his feet surveys,</a>
<a id='line_10362'>    Then turns him to the call and stretches forward,</a>
<a id='line_10363'>    Through the desire of food that draws him thither,</a>
<a id='line_10364'></a>
<a id='line_10365'>Such I became, and such, as far as cleaves</a>
<a id='line_10366'>    The rock to give a way to him who mounts,</a>
<a id='line_10367'>    Went on to where the circling doth begin.</a>
<a id='line_10368'></a>
<a id='line_10369'>On the fifth circle when I had come forth,</a>
<a id='line_10370'>    People I saw upon it who were weeping,</a>
<a id='line_10371'>    Stretched prone upon the ground, all downward turned.</a>
<a id='line_10372'></a>
<a id='line_10373'>“Adhaesit pavimento anima mea,”</a>
<a id='line_10374'>    I heard them say with sighings so profound,</a>
<a id='line_10375'>    That hardly could the words be understood.</a>
<a id='line_10376'></a>
<a id='line_10377'>“O ye elect of God, whose sufferings</a>
<a id='line_10378'>    Justice and Hope both render less severe,</a>

<a id='line_10380'></a>
<a id='line_10381'>“If ye are come secure from this prostration,</a>

<a id='line_10384'></a>
<a id='line_10385'>Thus did the Poet ask, and thus was answered</a>
<a id='line_10386'>    By them somewhat in front of us; whence I</a>
<a id='line_10387'>    In what was spoken divined the rest concealed,</a>
<a id='line_10388'></a>
<a id='line_10389'>And unto my Lord’s eyes mine eyes I turned;</a>
<a id='line_10390'>    Whence he assented with a cheerful sign</a>
<a id='line_10391'>    To what the sight of my desire implored.</a>
<a id='line_10392'></a>
<a id='line_10393'>When of myself I could dispose at will,</a>
<a id='line_10394'>    Above that creature did I draw myself,</a>
<a id='line_10395'>    Whose words before had caused me to take note,</a>
<a id='line_10396'></a>
<a id='line_10397'>Saying: “O Spirit, in whom weeping ripens</a>
<a id='line_10398'>    That without which to God we cannot turn,</a>

<a id='line_10400'></a>
<a id='line_10401'>Who wast thou, and why are your backs turned upwards,</a>

<a id='line_10404'></a>
<a id='line_10405'>And he to me: “Wherefore our backs the heaven</a>

<a id='line_10408'></a>
<a id='line_10409'>Between Siestri and Chiaveri descends</a>
<a id='line_10410'>    A river beautiful, and of its name</a>

<a id='line_10416'></a>
<a id='line_10417'>Tardy, ah woe is me! was my conversion;</a>
<a id='line_10418'>    But when the Roman Shepherd I was made,</a>
<a id='line_10419'>    Then I discovered life to be a lie.</a>

<a id='line_10422'>    Nor farther in that life could one ascend;</a>
<a id='line_10423'>    Whereby the love of this was kindled in me.</a>
<a id='line_10424'></a>
<a id='line_10425'>Until that time a wretched soul and parted</a>
<a id='line_10426'>    From God was I, and wholly avaricious;</a>
<a id='line_10427'>    Now, as thou seest, I here am punished for it.</a>
<a id='line_10428'></a>
<a id='line_10429'>What avarice does is here made manifest</a>

<a id='line_10444'></a>
<a id='line_10445'>I on my knees had fallen, and wished to speak;</a>

<a id='line_10452'></a>
<a id='line_10453'>“Straighten thy legs, and upward raise thee, brother,”</a>

<a id='line_10644'></a>
<a id='line_10645'>When I perceived, like something that is falling,</a>

<a id='line_10648'></a>
<a id='line_10649'>Certes so violently shook not Delos,</a>

<a id='line_10652'></a>
<a id='line_10653'>Then upon all sides there began a cry,</a>
<a id='line_10654'>    Such that the Master drew himself towards me,</a>
<a id='line_10655'>    Saying, “Fear not, while I am guiding thee.”</a>
<a id='line_10656'></a>
<a id='line_10657'>“Gloria in excelsis Deo,” all</a>
<a id='line_10658'>    Were saying, from what near I comprehended,</a>
<a id='line_10659'>    Where it was possible to hear the cry.</a>
<a id='line_10660'></a>
<a id='line_10661'>We paused immovable and in suspense,</a>
<a id='line_10662'>    Even as the shepherds who first heard that song,</a>
<a id='line_10663'>    Until the trembling ceased, and it was finished.</a>
<a id='line_10664'></a>
<a id='line_10665'>Then we resumed again our holy path,</a>
<a id='line_10666'>    Watching the shades that lay upon the ground,</a>
<a id='line_10667'>    Already turned to their accustomed plaint.</a>
<a id='line_10668'></a>
<a id='line_10669'>No ignorance ever with so great a strife</a>
<a id='line_10670'>    Had rendered me importunate to know,</a>
<a id='line_10671'>    If erreth not in this my memory,</a>

<a id='line_10692'></a>
<a id='line_10693'>And lo! in the same manner as Luke writeth</a>

<a id='line_10695'>    From the sepulchral cave already risen,</a>
<a id='line_10696'></a>
<a id='line_10697'>A shade appeared to us, and came behind us,</a>
<a id='line_10698'>    Down gazing on the prostrate multitude,</a>
<a id='line_10699'>    Nor were we ware of it, until it spake,</a>
<a id='line_10700'></a>
<a id='line_10701'>Saying, “My brothers, may God give you peace!”</a>
<a id='line_10702'>    We turned us suddenly, and Virgilius rendered</a>
<a id='line_10703'>    To him the countersign thereto conforming.</a>
<a id='line_10704'></a>
<a id='line_10705'>Thereon began he: “In the blessed council,</a>
<a id='line_10706'>    Thee may the court veracious place in peace,</a>
<a id='line_10707'>    That me doth banish in eternal exile!”</a>
<a id='line_10708'></a>
<a id='line_10709'>“How,” said he, and the while we went with speed,</a>
<a id='line_10710'>    “If ye are shades whom God deigns not on high,</a>
<a id='line_10711'>    Who up his stairs so far has guided you?”</a>
<a id='line_10712'></a>
<a id='line_10713'>And said my Teacher: “If thou note the marks</a>
<a id='line_10714'>    Which this one bears, and which the Angel traces</a>
<a id='line_10715'>    Well shalt thou see he with the good must reign.</a>
<a id='line_10716'></a>
<a id='line_10717'>But because she who spinneth day and night</a>
<a id='line_10718'>    For him had not yet drawn the distaff off,</a>
<a id='line_10719'>    Which Clotho lays for each one and compacts,</a>
<a id='line_10720'></a>
<a id='line_10721'>His soul, which is thy sister and my own,</a>

<a id='line_10723'>    By reason that it sees not in our fashion.</a>
<a id='line_10724'></a>
<a id='line_10725'>Whence I was drawn from out the ample throat</a>
<a id='line_10726'>    Of Hell to be his guide, and I shall guide him</a>
<a id='line_10727'>    As far on as my school has power to lead.</a>
<a id='line_10728'></a>
<a id='line_10729'>But tell us, if thou knowest, why such a shudder</a>
<a id='line_10730'>    Erewhile the mountain gave, and why together</a>
<a id='line_10731'>    All seemed to cry, as far as its moist feet?”</a>
<a id='line_10732'></a>
<a id='line_10733'>In asking he so hit the very eye</a>
<a id='line_10734'>    Of my desire, that merely with the hope</a>
<a id='line_10735'>    My thirst became the less unsatisfied.</a>
<a id='line_10736'></a>
<a id='line_10737'>“Naught is there,” he began, “that without order</a>

<a id='line_10748'></a>
<a id='line_10749'>Dense clouds do not appear, nor rarefied,</a>
<a id='line_10750'>    Nor coruscation, nor the daughter of Thaumas,</a>
<a id='line_10751'>    That often upon earth her region shifts;</a>
<a id='line_10752'></a>
<a id='line_10753'>No arid vapour any farther rises</a>
<a id='line_10754'>    Than to the top of the three steps I spake of,</a>
<a id='line_10755'>    Whereon the Vicar of Peter has his feet.</a>
<a id='line_10756'></a>
<a id='line_10757'>Lower down perchance it trembles less or more,</a>
<a id='line_10758'>    But, for the wind that in the earth is hidden</a>
<a id='line_10759'>    I know not how, up here it never trembled.</a>
<a id='line_10760'></a>
<a id='line_10761'>It trembles here, whenever any soul</a>
<a id='line_10762'>    Feels itself pure, so that it soars, or moves</a>
<a id='line_10763'>    To mount aloft, and such a cry attends it.</a>
<a id='line_10764'></a>
<a id='line_10765'>Of purity the will alone gives proof,</a>
<a id='line_10766'>    Which, being wholly free to change its convent,</a>
<a id='line_10767'>    Takes by surprise the soul, and helps it fly.</a>
<a id='line_10768'></a>
<a id='line_10769'>First it wills well; but the desire permits not,</a>
<a id='line_10770'>    Which divine justice with the self-same will</a>
<a id='line_10771'>    There was to sin, upon the torment sets.</a>
<a id='line_10772'></a>
<a id='line_10773'>And I, who have been lying in this pain</a>
<a id='line_10774'>    Five hundred years and more, but just now felt</a>
<a id='line_10775'>    A free volition for a better seat.</a>
<a id='line_10776'></a>
<a id='line_10777'>Therefore thou heardst the earthquake, and the pious</a>
<a id='line_10778'>    Spirits along the mountain rendering praise</a>
<a id='line_10779'>    Unto the Lord, that soon he speed them upwards.”</a>
<a id='line_10780'></a>
<a id='line_10781'>So said he to him; and since we enjoy</a>
<a id='line_10782'>    As much in drinking as the thirst is great,</a>
<a id='line_10783'>    I could not say how much it did me good.</a>
<a id='line_10784'></a>

<a id='line_10792'></a>
<a id='line_10793'>“In days when the good Titus, with the aid</a>

<a id='line_10808'></a>
<a id='line_10809'>The seeds unto my ardour were the sparks</a>

<a id='line_10812'></a>
<a id='line_10813'>Of the Aeneid speak I, which to me</a>
<a id='line_10814'>    A mother was, and was my nurse in song;</a>
<a id='line_10815'>    Without this weighed I not a drachma’s weight.</a>
<a id='line_10816'></a>
<a id='line_10817'>And to have lived upon the earth what time</a>

<a id='line_10819'>    More than I must ere issuing from my ban.”</a>
<a id='line_10820'></a>
<a id='line_10821'>These words towards me made Virgilius turn</a>
<a id='line_10822'>    With looks that in their silence said, “Be silent!”</a>
<a id='line_10823'>    But yet the power that wills cannot do all things;</a>
<a id='line_10824'></a>
<a id='line_10825'>For tears and laughter are such pursuivants</a>

<a id='line_10828'></a>
<a id='line_10829'>I only smiled, as one who gives the wink;</a>

<a id='line_11036'></a>

<a id='line_11044'></a>

<a id='line_11056'></a>

<a id='line_11060'></a>
<a id='line_11061'>Then said: “More thoughtful Mary was of making</a>

<a id='line_11180'></a>
<a id='line_11181'>For the same wish doth lead us to the tree</a>

<a id='line_11184'></a>
<a id='line_11185'>And I to him: “Forese, from that day</a>

<a id='line_11196'></a>
<a id='line_11197'>And he to me: “Thus speedily has led me</a>

<a id='line_11203'>    And from the other circles set me free.</a>
<a id='line_11204'></a>
<a id='line_11205'>So much more dear and pleasing is to God</a>

<a id='line_11236'></a>
<a id='line_11237'>Whence I to him: “If thou bring back to mind</a>

<a id='line_11239'>    The present memory will be grievous still.</a>
<a id='line_11240'></a>
<a id='line_11241'>Out of that life he turned me back who goes</a>

<a id='line_11244'></a>
<a id='line_11245'>And to the sun I pointed.  “Through the deep</a>

<a id='line_11272'></a>
<a id='line_11273'>And shadows, that appeared things doubly dead,</a>

<a id='line_11288'></a>
<a id='line_11289'>So said he first, and then: “’Tis not forbidden</a>

<a id='line_11300'></a>

<a id='line_11304'></a>
<a id='line_11305'>I saw for hunger bite the empty air</a>
<a id='line_11306'>    Ubaldin dalla Pila, and Boniface,</a>
<a id='line_11307'>    Who with his crook had pastured many people.</a>
<a id='line_11308'></a>
<a id='line_11309'>I saw Messer Marchese, who had leisure</a>

<a id='line_11312'></a>
<a id='line_11313'>But as he does who scans, and then doth prize</a>
<a id='line_11314'>    One more than others, did I him of Lucca,</a>

<a id='line_11320'></a>
<a id='line_11321'>“O soul,” I said, “that seemest so desirous</a>

<a id='line_11328'></a>
<a id='line_11329'>Thou shalt go on thy way with this prevision;</a>

<a id='line_11332'></a>
<a id='line_11333'>But say if him I here behold, who forth</a>
<a id='line_11334'>    Evoked the new-invented rhymes, beginning,</a>

<a id='line_11336'></a>
<a id='line_11337'>And I to him: “One am I, who, whenever</a>

<a id='line_11340'></a>
<a id='line_11341'>“O brother, now I see,” he said, “the knot</a>

<a id='line_11344'></a>
<a id='line_11345'>I do perceive full clearly how your pens</a>
<a id='line_11346'>    Go closely following after him who dictates,</a>

<a id='line_11351'>    And as if satisfied, he held his peace.</a>
<a id='line_11352'></a>

<a id='line_11354'>    Sometimes into a phalanx form themselves,</a>
<a id='line_11355'>    Then fly in greater haste, and go in file;</a>
<a id='line_11356'></a>
<a id='line_11357'>In such wise all the people who were there,</a>
<a id='line_11358'>    Turning their faces, hurried on their steps,</a>
<a id='line_11359'>    Both by their leanness and their wishes light.</a>
<a id='line_11360'></a>
<a id='line_11361'>And as a man, who weary is with trotting,</a>
<a id='line_11362'>    Lets his companions onward go, and walks,</a>
<a id='line_11363'>    Until he vents the panting of his chest;</a>
<a id='line_11364'></a>
<a id='line_11365'>So did Forese let the holy flock</a>
<a id='line_11366'>    Pass by, and came with me behind it, saying,</a>
<a id='line_11367'>    “When will it be that I again shall see thee?”</a>
<a id='line_11368'></a>
<a id='line_11369'>“How long,” I answered, “I may live, I know not;</a>
<a id='line_11370'>    Yet my return will not so speedy be,</a>
<a id='line_11371'>    But I shall sooner in desire arrive;</a>
<a id='line_11372'></a>
<a id='line_11373'>Because the place where I was set to live</a>
<a id='line_11374'>    From day to day of good is more depleted,</a>
<a id='line_11375'>    And unto dismal ruin seems ordained.”</a>
<a id='line_11376'></a>
<a id='line_11377'>“Now go,” he said, “for him most guilty of it</a>
<a id='line_11378'>    At a beast’s tail behold I dragged along</a>
<a id='line_11379'>    Towards the valley where is no repentance.</a>
<a id='line_11380'></a>
<a id='line_11381'>Faster at every step the beast is going,</a>
<a id='line_11382'>    Increasing evermore until it smites him,</a>
<a id='line_11383'>    And leaves the body vilely mutilated.</a>
<a id='line_11384'></a>
<a id='line_11385'>Not long those wheels shall turn,” and he uplifted</a>
<a id='line_11386'>    His eyes to heaven, “ere shall be clear to thee</a>
<a id='line_11387'>    That which my speech no farther can declare.</a>
<a id='line_11388'></a>
<a id='line_11389'>Now stay behind; because the time so precious</a>
<a id='line_11390'>    Is in this kingdom, that I lose too much</a>
<a id='line_11391'>    By coming onward thus abreast with thee.”</a>
<a id='line_11392'></a>
<a id='line_11393'>As sometimes issues forth upon a gallop</a>
<a id='line_11394'>    A cavalier from out a troop that ride,</a>
<a id='line_11395'>    And seeks the honour of the first encounter,</a>
<a id='line_11396'></a>
<a id='line_11397'>So he with greater strides departed from us;</a>
<a id='line_11398'>    And on the road remained I with those two,</a>
<a id='line_11399'>    Who were such mighty marshals of the world.</a>
<a id='line_11400'></a>
<a id='line_11401'>And when before us he had gone so far</a>
<a id='line_11402'>    Mine eyes became to him such pursuivants</a>
<a id='line_11403'>    As was my understanding to his words,</a>
<a id='line_11404'></a>
<a id='line_11405'>Appeared to me with laden and living boughs</a>
<a id='line_11406'>    Another apple-tree, and not far distant,</a>
<a id='line_11407'>    From having but just then turned thitherward.</a>
<a id='line_11408'></a>
<a id='line_11409'>People I saw beneath it lift their hands,</a>
<a id='line_11410'>    And cry I know not what towards the leaves,</a>
<a id='line_11411'>    Like little children eager and deluded,</a>
<a id='line_11412'></a>
<a id='line_11413'>Who pray, and he they pray to doth not answer,</a>
<a id='line_11414'>    But, to make very keen their appetite,</a>
<a id='line_11415'>    Holds their desire aloft, and hides it not.</a>
<a id='line_11416'></a>
<a id='line_11417'>Then they departed as if undeceived;</a>
<a id='line_11418'>    And now we came unto the mighty tree</a>
<a id='line_11419'>    Which prayers and tears so manifold refuses.</a>
<a id='line_11420'></a>
<a id='line_11421'>“Pass farther onward without drawing near;</a>
<a id='line_11422'>    The tree of which Eve ate is higher up,</a>
<a id='line_11423'>    And out of that one has this tree been raised.”</a>
<a id='line_11424'></a>
<a id='line_11425'>Thus said I know not who among the branches;</a>
<a id='line_11426'>    Whereat Virgilius, Statius, and myself</a>
<a id='line_11427'>    Went crowding forward on the side that rises.</a>
<a id='line_11428'></a>
<a id='line_11429'>“Be mindful,” said he, “of the accursed ones</a>
<a id='line_11430'>    Formed of the cloud-rack, who inebriate</a>
<a id='line_11431'>    Combated Theseus with their double breasts;</a>
<a id='line_11432'></a>
<a id='line_11433'>And of the Jews who showed them soft in drinking,</a>
<a id='line_11434'>    Whence Gideon would not have them for companions</a>
<a id='line_11435'>    When he tow’rds Midian the hills descended.”</a>
<a id='line_11436'></a>
<a id='line_11437'>Thus, closely pressed to one of the two borders,</a>
<a id='line_11438'>    On passed we, hearing sins of gluttony,</a>
<a id='line_11439'>    Followed forsooth by miserable gains;</a>
<a id='line_11440'></a>
<a id='line_11441'>Then set at large upon the lonely road,</a>
<a id='line_11442'>    A thousand steps and more we onward went,</a>
<a id='line_11443'>    In contemplation, each without a word.</a>
<a id='line_11444'></a>
<a id='line_11445'>“What go ye thinking thus, ye three alone?”</a>
<a id='line_11446'>    Said suddenly a voice, whereat I started</a>
<a id='line_11447'>    As terrified and timid beasts are wont.</a>
<a id='line_11448'></a>
<a id='line_11449'>I raised my head to see who this might be,</a>
<a id='line_11450'>    And never in a furnace was there seen</a>
<a id='line_11451'>    Metals or glass so lucent and so red</a>
<a id='line_11452'></a>
<a id='line_11453'>As one I saw who said: “If it may please you</a>
<a id='line_11454'>    To mount aloft, here it behoves you turn;</a>
<a id='line_11455'>    This way goes he who goeth after peace.”</a>
<a id='line_11456'></a>
<a id='line_11457'>His aspect had bereft me of my sight,</a>
<a id='line_11458'>    So that I turned me back unto my Teachers,</a>
<a id='line_11459'>    Like one who goeth as his hearing guides him.</a>
<a id='line_11460'></a>
<a id='line_11461'>And as, the harbinger of early dawn,</a>
<a id='line_11462'>    The air of May doth move and breathe out fragrance,</a>
<a id='line_11463'>    Impregnate all with herbage and with flowers,</a>
<a id='line_11464'></a>
<a id='line_11465'>So did I feel a breeze strike in the midst</a>
<a id='line_11466'>    My front, and felt the moving of the plumes</a>
<a id='line_11467'>    That breathed around an odour of ambrosia;</a>
<a id='line_11468'></a>
<a id='line_11469'>And heard it said: “Blessed are they whom grace</a>

<a id='line_11504'></a>
<a id='line_11505'>With confidence I opened then my mouth,</a>

<a id='line_11632'></a>

<a id='line_11637'>My Leader said: “Along this place one ought</a>

<a id='line_11641'>“Summae Deus clementiae,” in the bosom</a>

<a id='line_11648'></a>
<a id='line_11649'>After the close which to that hymn is made,</a>
<a id='line_11650'>    Aloud they shouted, “Virum non cognosco;”</a>
<a id='line_11651'>    Then recommenced the hymn with voices low.</a>
<a id='line_11652'></a>
<a id='line_11653'>This also ended, cried they: “To the wood</a>

<a id='line_11659'>    As virtue and the marriage vow imposes.</a>
<a id='line_11660'></a>

<a id='line_11672'></a>
<a id='line_11673'>While on the brink thus one before the other</a>
<a id='line_11674'>    We went upon our way, oft the good Master</a>
<a id='line_11675'>    Said: “Take thou heed! suffice it that I warn thee.”</a>
<a id='line_11676'></a>
<a id='line_11677'>On the right shoulder smote me now the sun,</a>
<a id='line_11678'>    That, raying out, already the whole west</a>

<a id='line_11680'></a>
<a id='line_11681'>And with my shadow did I make the flame</a>
<a id='line_11682'>    Appear more red; and even to such a sign</a>

<a id='line_11689'>Then towards me, as far as they could come,</a>

<a id='line_11692'></a>
<a id='line_11693'>“O thou who goest, not from being slower</a>

<a id='line_11710'>    There came a people face to face with these,</a>
<a id='line_11711'>    Which held me in suspense with gazing at them.</a>
<a id='line_11712'></a>
<a id='line_11713'>There see I hastening upon either side</a>
<a id='line_11714'>    Each of the shades, and kissing one another</a>
<a id='line_11715'>    Without a pause, content with brief salute.</a>
<a id='line_11716'></a>
<a id='line_11717'>Thus in the middle of their brown battalions</a>
<a id='line_11718'>    Muzzle to muzzle one ant meets another</a>

<a id='line_11733'>One folk is going, and the other coming,</a>

<a id='line_11736'></a>
<a id='line_11737'>And close to me approached, even as before,</a>

<a id='line_11893'></a>
<a id='line_11894'>Outside the flame he stood upon the verge,</a>
<a id='line_11895'>    And chanted forth, “Beati mundo corde,”</a>
<a id='line_11896'>    In voice by far more living than our own.</a>

<a id='line_11898'>Then: “No one farther goes, souls sanctified,</a>

<a id='line_11933'></a>
<a id='line_11934'>As at the name of Thisbe oped his lids</a>

<a id='line_11944'>    Does at a child who’s vanquished by an apple.</a>
<a id='line_11945'></a>
<a id='line_11946'>Then into the fire in front of me he entered,</a>

<a id='line_11954'>And my sweet Father, to encourage me,</a>
<a id='line_11955'>    Discoursing still of Beatrice went on,</a>
<a id='line_11956'>    Saying: “Her eyes I seem to see already!”</a>
<a id='line_11957'></a>
<a id='line_11958'>A voice, that on the other side was singing,</a>
<a id='line_11959'>    Directed us, and we, attent alone</a>
<a id='line_11960'>    On that, came forth where the ascent began.</a>
<a id='line_11961'></a>
<a id='line_11962'>“Venite, benedicti Patris mei,”</a>
<a id='line_11963'>    Sounded within a splendour, which was there</a>
<a id='line_11964'>    Such it o’ercame me, and I could not look.</a>
<a id='line_11965'></a>
<a id='line_11966'>“The sun departs,” it added, “and night cometh;</a>

<a id='line_11969'></a>
<a id='line_11970'>Straight forward through the rock the path ascended</a>
<a id='line_11971'>    In such a way that I cut off the rays</a>

<a id='line_11973'></a>

<a id='line_11975'>    Ere by the vanished shadow the sun’s setting</a>
<a id='line_11976'>    Behind us we perceived, I and my Sages.</a>
<a id='line_11977'></a>
<a id='line_11978'>And ere in all its parts immeasurable</a>
<a id='line_11979'>    The horizon of one aspect had become,</a>
<a id='line_11980'>    And Night her boundless dispensation held,</a>
<a id='line_11981'></a>
<a id='line_11982'>Each of us of a stair had made his bed;</a>
<a id='line_11983'>    Because the nature of the mount took from us</a>
<a id='line_11984'>    The power of climbing, more than the delight.</a>
<a id='line_11985'></a>
<a id='line_11986'>Even as in ruminating passive grow</a>
<a id='line_11987'>    The goats, who have been swift and venturesome</a>
<a id='line_11988'>    Upon the mountain-tops ere they were fed,</a>
<a id='line_11989'></a>
<a id='line_11990'>Hushed in the shadow, while the sun is hot,</a>
<a id='line_11991'>    Watched by the herdsman, who upon his staff</a>
<a id='line_11992'>    Is leaning, and in leaning tendeth them;</a>
<a id='line_11993'></a>
<a id='line_11994'>And as the shepherd, lodging out of doors,</a>
<a id='line_11995'>    Passes the night beside his quiet flock,</a>
<a id='line_11996'>    Watching that no wild beast may scatter it,</a>
<a id='line_11997'></a>
<a id='line_11998'>Such at that hour were we, all three of us,</a>
<a id='line_11999'>    I like the goat, and like the herdsmen they,</a>
<a id='line_12000'>    Begirt on this side and on that by rocks.</a>
<a id='line_12001'></a>
<a id='line_12002'>Little could there be seen of things without;</a>
<a id='line_12003'>    But through that little I beheld the stars</a>
<a id='line_12004'>    More luminous and larger than their wont.</a>
<a id='line_12005'></a>
<a id='line_12006'>Thus ruminating, and beholding these,</a>
<a id='line_12007'>    Sleep seized upon me,—sleep, that oftentimes</a>
<a id='line_12008'>    Before a deed is done has tidings of it.</a>
<a id='line_12009'></a>
<a id='line_12010'>It was the hour, I think, when from the East</a>
<a id='line_12011'>    First on the mountain Citherea beamed,</a>
<a id='line_12012'>    Who with the fire of love seems always burning;</a>
<a id='line_12013'></a>
<a id='line_12014'>Youthful and beautiful in dreams methought</a>
<a id='line_12015'>    I saw a lady walking in a meadow,</a>
<a id='line_12016'>    Gathering flowers; and singing she was saying:</a>
<a id='line_12017'></a>
<a id='line_12018'>“Know whosoever may my name demand</a>
<a id='line_12019'>    That I am Leah, and go moving round</a>
<a id='line_12020'>    My beauteous hands to make myself a garland.</a>
<a id='line_12021'></a>
<a id='line_12022'>To please me at the mirror, here I deck me,</a>
<a id='line_12023'>    But never does my sister Rachel leave</a>
<a id='line_12024'>    Her looking-glass, and sitteth all day long.</a>
<a id='line_12025'></a>
<a id='line_12026'>To see her beauteous eyes as eager is she,</a>
<a id='line_12027'>    As I am to adorn me with my hands;</a>
<a id='line_12028'>    Her, seeing, and me, doing satisfies.”</a>
<a id='line_12029'></a>
<a id='line_12030'>And now before the antelucan splendours</a>
<a id='line_12031'>    That unto pilgrims the more grateful rise,</a>
<a id='line_12032'>    As, home-returning, less remote they lodge,</a>
<a id='line_12033'></a>
<a id='line_12034'>The darkness fled away on every side,</a>
<a id='line_12035'>    And slumber with it; whereupon I rose,</a>
<a id='line_12036'>    Seeing already the great Masters risen.</a>
<a id='line_12037'></a>
<a id='line_12038'>“That apple sweet, which through so many branches</a>

<a id='line_12041'></a>
<a id='line_12042'>Speaking to me, Virgilius of such words</a>
<a id='line_12043'>    As these made use; and never were there guerdons</a>
<a id='line_12044'>    That could in pleasantness compare with these.</a>
<a id='line_12045'></a>
<a id='line_12046'>Such longing upon longing came upon me</a>
<a id='line_12047'>    To be above, that at each step thereafter</a>
<a id='line_12048'>    For flight I felt in me the pinions growing.</a>
<a id='line_12049'></a>
<a id='line_12050'>When underneath us was the stairway all</a>
<a id='line_12051'>    Run o’er, and we were on the highest step,</a>
<a id='line_12052'>    Virgilius fastened upon me his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_12053'></a>

<a id='line_12089'></a>
<a id='line_12090'>A softly-breathing air, that no mutation</a>

<a id='line_12158'>And my entreaties made to be content,</a>
<a id='line_12159'>    So near approaching, that the dulcet sound</a>
<a id='line_12160'>    Came unto me together with its meaning</a>
<a id='line_12161'></a>

<a id='line_12163'>    Bathed by the waters of the beauteous river,</a>
<a id='line_12164'>    To lift her eyes she granted me the boon.</a>

<a id='line_12173'></a>
<a id='line_12174'>Apart three paces did the river make us;</a>

<a id='line_12253'></a>
<a id='line_12254'>Here Lethe, as upon the other side</a>

<a id='line_12267'>    The Age of Gold and its felicity,</a>

<a id='line_12269'></a>

<a id='line_12273'></a>
<a id='line_12274'>Then backward did I turn me wholly round</a>
<a id='line_12275'>    Unto my Poets, and saw that with a smile</a>
<a id='line_12276'>    They had been listening to these closing words;</a>
<a id='line_12277'></a>
<a id='line_12278'>Then to the beautiful lady turned mine eyes.</a>

<a id='line_12280'></a>
<a id='line_12281'></a>
<a id='line_12282'></a>
<a id='line_12283'>Purgatorio: Canto XXIX</a>
<a id='line_12284'></a>
<a id='line_12285'></a>
<a id='line_12286'>Singing like unto an enamoured lady</a>
<a id='line_12287'>    She, with the ending of her words, continued:</a>
<a id='line_12288'>    “Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata.”</a>
<a id='line_12289'></a>
<a id='line_12290'>And even as Nymphs, that wandered all alone</a>
<a id='line_12291'>    Among the sylvan shadows, sedulous</a>
<a id='line_12292'>    One to avoid and one to see the sun,</a>
<a id='line_12293'></a>
<a id='line_12294'>She then against the stream moved onward, going</a>
<a id='line_12295'>    Along the bank, and I abreast of her,</a>
<a id='line_12296'>    Her little steps with little steps attending.</a>
<a id='line_12297'></a>
<a id='line_12298'>Between her steps and mine were not a hundred,</a>
<a id='line_12299'>    When equally the margins gave a turn,</a>
<a id='line_12300'>    In such a way, that to the East I faced.</a>
<a id='line_12301'></a>
<a id='line_12302'>Nor even thus our way continued far</a>
<a id='line_12303'>    Before the lady wholly turned herself</a>
<a id='line_12304'>    Unto me, saying, “Brother, look and listen!”</a>
<a id='line_12305'></a>
<a id='line_12306'>And lo! a sudden lustre ran across</a>
<a id='line_12307'>    On every side athwart the spacious forest,</a>
<a id='line_12308'>    Such that it made me doubt if it were lightning.</a>
<a id='line_12309'></a>
<a id='line_12310'>But since the lightning ceases as it comes,</a>
<a id='line_12311'>    And that continuing brightened more and more,</a>
<a id='line_12312'>    Within my thought I said, “What thing is this?”</a>
<a id='line_12313'></a>
<a id='line_12314'>And a delicious melody there ran</a>
<a id='line_12315'>    Along the luminous air, whence holy zeal</a>
<a id='line_12316'>    Made me rebuke the hardihood of Eve;</a>
<a id='line_12317'></a>
<a id='line_12318'>For there where earth and heaven obedient were,</a>
<a id='line_12319'>    The woman only, and but just created,</a>
<a id='line_12320'>    Could not endure to stay ’neath any veil;</a>
<a id='line_12321'></a>
<a id='line_12322'>Underneath which had she devoutly stayed,</a>
<a id='line_12323'>    I sooner should have tasted those delights</a>
<a id='line_12324'>    Ineffable, and for a longer time.</a>
<a id='line_12325'></a>
<a id='line_12326'>While ’mid such manifold first-fruits I walked</a>
<a id='line_12327'>    Of the eternal pleasure all enrapt,</a>
<a id='line_12328'>    And still solicitous of more delights,</a>
<a id='line_12329'></a>
<a id='line_12330'>In front of us like an enkindled fire</a>
<a id='line_12331'>    Became the air beneath the verdant boughs,</a>
<a id='line_12332'>    And the sweet sound as singing now was heard.</a>
<a id='line_12333'></a>
<a id='line_12334'>O Virgins sacrosanct! if ever hunger,</a>
<a id='line_12335'>    Vigils, or cold for you I have endured,</a>
<a id='line_12336'>    The occasion spurs me their reward to claim!</a>
<a id='line_12337'></a>
<a id='line_12338'>Now Helicon must needs pour forth for me,</a>
<a id='line_12339'>    And with her choir Urania must assist me,</a>
<a id='line_12340'>    To put in verse things difficult to think.</a>
<a id='line_12341'></a>
<a id='line_12342'>A little farther on, seven trees of gold</a>
<a id='line_12343'>    In semblance the long space still intervening</a>
<a id='line_12344'>    Between ourselves and them did counterfeit;</a>
<a id='line_12345'></a>
<a id='line_12346'>But when I had approached so near to them</a>
<a id='line_12347'>    The common object, which the sense deceives,</a>
<a id='line_12348'>    Lost not by distance any of its marks,</a>
<a id='line_12349'></a>
<a id='line_12350'>The faculty that lends discourse to reason</a>
<a id='line_12351'>    Did apprehend that they were candlesticks,</a>
<a id='line_12352'>    And in the voices of the song “Hosanna!”</a>
<a id='line_12353'></a>
<a id='line_12354'>Above them flamed the harness beautiful,</a>
<a id='line_12355'>    Far brighter than the moon in the serene</a>
<a id='line_12356'>    Of midnight, at the middle of her month.</a>
<a id='line_12357'></a>
<a id='line_12358'>I turned me round, with admiration filled,</a>
<a id='line_12359'>    To good Virgilius, and he answered me</a>
<a id='line_12360'>    With visage no less full of wonderment.</a>
<a id='line_12361'></a>
<a id='line_12362'>Then back I turned my face to those high things,</a>
<a id='line_12363'>    Which moved themselves towards us so sedately,</a>
<a id='line_12364'>    They had been distanced by new-wedded brides.</a>
<a id='line_12365'></a>
<a id='line_12366'>The lady chid me: “Why dost thou burn only</a>
<a id='line_12367'>    So with affection for the living lights,</a>
<a id='line_12368'>    And dost not look at what comes after them?”</a>
<a id='line_12369'></a>
<a id='line_12370'>Then saw I people, as behind their leaders,</a>
<a id='line_12371'>    Coming behind them, garmented in white,</a>
<a id='line_12372'>    And such a whiteness never was on earth.</a>
<a id='line_12373'></a>
<a id='line_12374'>The water on my left flank was resplendent,</a>
<a id='line_12375'>    And back to me reflected my left side,</a>
<a id='line_12376'>    E’en as a mirror, if I looked therein.</a>
<a id='line_12377'></a>
<a id='line_12378'>When I upon my margin had such post</a>
<a id='line_12379'>    That nothing but the stream divided us,</a>
<a id='line_12380'>    Better to see I gave my steps repose;</a>
<a id='line_12381'></a>
<a id='line_12382'>And I beheld the flamelets onward go,</a>
<a id='line_12383'>    Leaving behind themselves the air depicted,</a>
<a id='line_12384'>    And they of trailing pennons had the semblance,</a>
<a id='line_12385'></a>
<a id='line_12386'>So that it overhead remained distinct</a>
<a id='line_12387'>    With sevenfold lists, all of them of the colours</a>
<a id='line_12388'>    Whence the sun’s bow is made, and Delia’s girdle.</a>
<a id='line_12389'></a>
<a id='line_12390'>These standards to the rearward longer were</a>
<a id='line_12391'>    Than was my sight; and, as it seemed to me,</a>
<a id='line_12392'>    Ten paces were the outermost apart.</a>
<a id='line_12393'></a>
<a id='line_12394'>Under so fair a heaven as I describe</a>
<a id='line_12395'>    The four and twenty Elders, two by two,</a>
<a id='line_12396'>    Came on incoronate with flower-de-luce.</a>
<a id='line_12397'></a>
<a id='line_12398'>They all of them were singing: “Blessed thou</a>
<a id='line_12399'>    Among the daughters of Adam art, and blessed</a>
<a id='line_12400'>    For evermore shall be thy loveliness.”</a>
<a id='line_12401'></a>
<a id='line_12402'>After the flowers and other tender grasses</a>
<a id='line_12403'>    In front of me upon the other margin</a>
<a id='line_12404'>    Were disencumbered of that race elect,</a>
<a id='line_12405'></a>
<a id='line_12406'>Even as in heaven star followeth after star,</a>
<a id='line_12407'>    There came close after them four animals,</a>
<a id='line_12408'>    Incoronate each one with verdant leaf.</a>
<a id='line_12409'></a>
<a id='line_12410'>Plumed with six wings was every one of them,</a>
<a id='line_12411'>    The plumage full of eyes; the eyes of Argus</a>
<a id='line_12412'>    If they were living would be such as these.</a>
<a id='line_12413'></a>
<a id='line_12414'>Reader! to trace their forms no more I waste</a>
<a id='line_12415'>    My rhymes; for other spendings press me so,</a>
<a id='line_12416'>    That I in this cannot be prodigal.</a>
<a id='line_12417'></a>
<a id='line_12418'>But read Ezekiel, who depicteth them</a>
<a id='line_12419'>    As he beheld them from the region cold</a>
<a id='line_12420'>    Coming with cloud, with whirlwind, and with fire;</a>
<a id='line_12421'></a>
<a id='line_12422'>And such as thou shalt find them in his pages,</a>
<a id='line_12423'>    Such were they here; saving that in their plumage</a>
<a id='line_12424'>    John is with me, and differeth from him.</a>
<a id='line_12425'></a>
<a id='line_12426'>The interval between these four contained</a>
<a id='line_12427'>    A chariot triumphal on two wheels,</a>
<a id='line_12428'>    Which by a Griffin’s neck came drawn along;</a>
<a id='line_12429'></a>
<a id='line_12430'>And upward he extended both his wings</a>
<a id='line_12431'>    Between the middle list and three and three,</a>
<a id='line_12432'>    So that he injured none by cleaving it.</a>
<a id='line_12433'></a>
<a id='line_12434'>So high they rose that they were lost to sight;</a>
<a id='line_12435'>    His limbs were gold, so far as he was bird,</a>
<a id='line_12436'>    And white the others with vermilion mingled.</a>
<a id='line_12437'></a>
<a id='line_12438'>Not only Rome with no such splendid car</a>
<a id='line_12439'>    E’er gladdened Africanus, or Augustus,</a>
<a id='line_12440'>    But poor to it that of the Sun would be,—</a>
<a id='line_12441'></a>
<a id='line_12442'>That of the Sun, which swerving was burnt up</a>
<a id='line_12443'>    At the importunate orison of Earth,</a>
<a id='line_12444'>    When Jove was so mysteriously just.</a>
<a id='line_12445'></a>
<a id='line_12446'>Three maidens at the right wheel in a circle</a>
<a id='line_12447'>    Came onward dancing; one so very red</a>
<a id='line_12448'>    That in the fire she hardly had been noted.</a>
<a id='line_12449'></a>
<a id='line_12450'>The second was as if her flesh and bones</a>
<a id='line_12451'>    Had all been fashioned out of emerald;</a>
<a id='line_12452'>    The third appeared as snow but newly fallen.</a>
<a id='line_12453'></a>
<a id='line_12454'>And now they seemed conducted by the white,</a>
<a id='line_12455'>    Now by the red, and from the song of her</a>
<a id='line_12456'>    The others took their step, or slow or swift.</a>
<a id='line_12457'></a>
<a id='line_12458'>Upon the left hand four made holiday</a>
<a id='line_12459'>    Vested in purple, following the measure</a>
<a id='line_12460'>    Of one of them with three eyes in her head.</a>
<a id='line_12461'></a>
<a id='line_12462'>In rear of all the group here treated of</a>
<a id='line_12463'>    Two old men I beheld, unlike in habit,</a>
<a id='line_12464'>    But like in gait, each dignified and grave.</a>
<a id='line_12465'></a>
<a id='line_12466'>One showed himself as one of the disciples</a>
<a id='line_12467'>    Of that supreme Hippocrates, whom nature</a>
<a id='line_12468'>    Made for the animals she holds most dear;</a>
<a id='line_12469'></a>
<a id='line_12470'>Contrary care the other manifested,</a>
<a id='line_12471'>    With sword so shining and so sharp, it caused</a>
<a id='line_12472'>    Terror to me on this side of the river.</a>
<a id='line_12473'></a>
<a id='line_12474'>Thereafter four I saw of humble aspect,</a>
<a id='line_12475'>    And behind all an aged man alone</a>
<a id='line_12476'>    Walking in sleep with countenance acute.</a>
<a id='line_12477'></a>
<a id='line_12478'>And like the foremost company these seven</a>
<a id='line_12479'>    Were habited; yet of the flower-de-luce</a>
<a id='line_12480'>    No garland round about the head they wore,</a>
<a id='line_12481'></a>
<a id='line_12482'>But of the rose, and other flowers vermilion;</a>
<a id='line_12483'>    At little distance would the sight have sworn</a>
<a id='line_12484'>    That all were in a flame above their brows.</a>
<a id='line_12485'></a>
<a id='line_12486'>And when the car was opposite to me</a>
<a id='line_12487'>    Thunder was heard; and all that folk august</a>

<a id='line_12505'></a>
<a id='line_12506'>Motionless halted, the veracious people,</a>
<a id='line_12507'>    That came at first between it and the Griffin,</a>
<a id='line_12508'>    Turned themselves to the car, as to their peace.</a>
<a id='line_12509'></a>
<a id='line_12510'>And one of them, as if by Heaven commissioned,</a>
<a id='line_12511'>    Singing, “Veni, sponsa, de Libano”</a>
<a id='line_12512'>    Shouted three times, and all the others after.</a>
<a id='line_12513'></a>
<a id='line_12514'>Even as the Blessed at the final summons</a>

<a id='line_12519'>    A hundred rose ‘ad vocem tanti senis,’</a>
<a id='line_12520'>    Ministers and messengers of life eternal.</a>
<a id='line_12521'></a>
<a id='line_12522'>They all were saying, “Benedictus qui venis,”</a>
<a id='line_12523'>    And, scattering flowers above and round about,</a>
<a id='line_12524'>    “Manibus o date lilia plenis.”</a>
<a id='line_12525'></a>
<a id='line_12526'>Ere now have I beheld, as day began,</a>
<a id='line_12527'>    The eastern hemisphere all tinged with rose,</a>
<a id='line_12528'>    And the other heaven with fair serene adorned;</a>
<a id='line_12529'></a>
<a id='line_12530'>And the sun’s face, uprising, overshadowed</a>
<a id='line_12531'>    So that by tempering influence of vapours</a>
<a id='line_12532'>    For a long interval the eye sustained it;</a>
<a id='line_12533'></a>
<a id='line_12534'>Thus in the bosom of a cloud of flowers</a>
<a id='line_12535'>    Which from those hands angelical ascended,</a>
<a id='line_12536'>    And downward fell again inside and out,</a>
<a id='line_12537'></a>
<a id='line_12538'>Over her snow-white veil with olive cinct</a>
<a id='line_12539'>    Appeared a lady under a green mantle,</a>
<a id='line_12540'>    Vested in colour of the living flame.</a>
<a id='line_12541'></a>
<a id='line_12542'>And my own spirit, that already now</a>
<a id='line_12543'>    So long a time had been, that in her presence</a>
<a id='line_12544'>    Trembling with awe it had not stood abashed,</a>
<a id='line_12545'></a>
<a id='line_12546'>Without more knowledge having by mine eyes,</a>

<a id='line_12548'>    Of ancient love the mighty influence felt.</a>
<a id='line_12549'></a>
<a id='line_12550'>As soon as on my vision smote the power</a>
<a id='line_12551'>    Sublime, that had already pierced me through</a>
<a id='line_12552'>    Ere from my boyhood I had yet come forth,</a>
<a id='line_12553'></a>
<a id='line_12554'>To the left hand I turned with that reliance</a>
<a id='line_12555'>    With which the little child runs to his mother,</a>
<a id='line_12556'>    When he has fear, or when he is afflicted,</a>
<a id='line_12557'></a>
<a id='line_12558'>To say unto Virgilius: “Not a drachm</a>
<a id='line_12559'>    Of blood remains in me, that does not tremble;</a>
<a id='line_12560'>    I know the traces of the ancient flame.”</a>
<a id='line_12561'></a>
<a id='line_12562'>But us Virgilius of himself deprived</a>
<a id='line_12563'>    Had left, Virgilius, sweetest of all fathers,</a>
<a id='line_12564'>    Virgilius, to whom I for safety gave me:</a>
<a id='line_12565'></a>
<a id='line_12566'>Nor whatsoever lost the ancient mother</a>
<a id='line_12567'>    Availed my cheeks now purified from dew,</a>
<a id='line_12568'>    That weeping they should not again be darkened.</a>
<a id='line_12569'></a>
<a id='line_12570'>“Dante, because Virgilius has departed</a>
<a id='line_12571'>    Do not weep yet, do not weep yet awhile;</a>
<a id='line_12572'>    For by another sword thou need’st must weep.”</a>
<a id='line_12573'></a>
<a id='line_12574'>E’en as an admiral, who on poop and prow</a>
<a id='line_12575'>    Comes to behold the people that are working</a>
<a id='line_12576'>    In other ships, and cheers them to well-doing,</a>
<a id='line_12577'></a>
<a id='line_12578'>Upon the left hand border of the car,</a>
<a id='line_12579'>    When at the sound I turned of my own name,</a>
<a id='line_12580'>    Which of necessity is here recorded,</a>
<a id='line_12581'></a>
<a id='line_12582'>I saw the Lady, who erewhile appeared</a>
<a id='line_12583'>    Veiled underneath the angelic festival,</a>
<a id='line_12584'>    Direct her eyes to me across the river.</a>
<a id='line_12585'></a>
<a id='line_12586'>Although the veil, that from her head descended,</a>
<a id='line_12587'>    Encircled with the foliage of Minerva,</a>
<a id='line_12588'>    Did not permit her to appear distinctly,</a>
<a id='line_12589'></a>
<a id='line_12590'>In attitude still royally majestic</a>
<a id='line_12591'>    Continued she, like unto one who speaks,</a>
<a id='line_12592'>    And keeps his warmest utterance in reserve:</a>
<a id='line_12593'></a>
<a id='line_12594'>“Look at me well; in sooth I’m Beatrice!</a>
<a id='line_12595'>    How didst thou deign to come unto the Mountain?</a>
<a id='line_12596'>    Didst thou not know that man is happy here?”</a>
<a id='line_12597'></a>
<a id='line_12598'>Mine eyes fell downward into the clear fountain,</a>
<a id='line_12599'>    But, seeing myself therein, I sought the grass,</a>
<a id='line_12600'>    So great a shame did weigh my forehead down.</a>
<a id='line_12601'></a>
<a id='line_12602'>As to the son the mother seems superb,</a>
<a id='line_12603'>    So she appeared to me; for somewhat bitter</a>
<a id='line_12604'>    Tasteth the savour of severe compassion.</a>
<a id='line_12605'></a>
<a id='line_12606'>Silent became she, and the Angels sang</a>
<a id='line_12607'>    Suddenly, “In te, Domine, speravi:”</a>
<a id='line_12608'>    But beyond ‘pedes meos’ did not pass.</a>
<a id='line_12609'></a>
<a id='line_12610'>Even as the snow among the living rafters</a>
<a id='line_12611'>    Upon the back of Italy congeals,</a>
<a id='line_12612'>    Blown on and drifted by Sclavonian winds,</a>
<a id='line_12613'></a>
<a id='line_12614'>And then, dissolving, trickles through itself</a>
<a id='line_12615'>    Whene’er the land that loses shadow breathes,</a>
<a id='line_12616'>    So that it seems a fire that melts a taper;</a>
<a id='line_12617'></a>
<a id='line_12618'>E’en thus was I without a tear or sigh,</a>
<a id='line_12619'>    Before the song of those who sing for ever</a>
<a id='line_12620'>    After the music of the eternal spheres.</a>
<a id='line_12621'></a>
<a id='line_12622'>But when I heard in their sweet melodies</a>
<a id='line_12623'>    Compassion for me, more than had they said,</a>
<a id='line_12624'>    “O wherefore, lady, dost thou thus upbraid him?”</a>
<a id='line_12625'></a>
<a id='line_12626'>The ice, that was about my heart congealed,</a>
<a id='line_12627'>    To air and water changed, and in my anguish</a>
<a id='line_12628'>    Through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast.</a>
<a id='line_12629'></a>
<a id='line_12630'>She, on the right-hand border of the car</a>
<a id='line_12631'>    Still firmly standing, to those holy beings</a>
<a id='line_12632'>    Thus her discourse directed afterwards:</a>
<a id='line_12633'></a>
<a id='line_12634'>“Ye keep your watch in the eternal day,</a>
<a id='line_12635'>    So that nor night nor sleep can steal from you</a>
<a id='line_12636'>    One step the ages make upon their path;</a>
<a id='line_12637'></a>
<a id='line_12638'>Therefore my answer is with greater care,</a>
<a id='line_12639'>    That he may hear me who is weeping yonder,</a>
<a id='line_12640'>    So that the sin and dole be of one measure.</a>
<a id='line_12641'></a>
<a id='line_12642'>Not only by the work of those great wheels,</a>
<a id='line_12643'>    That destine every seed unto some end,</a>
<a id='line_12644'>    According as the stars are in conjunction,</a>
<a id='line_12645'></a>
<a id='line_12646'>But by the largess of celestial graces,</a>
<a id='line_12647'>    Which have such lofty vapours for their rain</a>
<a id='line_12648'>    That near to them our sight approaches not,</a>
<a id='line_12649'></a>
<a id='line_12650'>Such had this man become in his new life</a>
<a id='line_12651'>    Potentially, that every righteous habit</a>
<a id='line_12652'>    Would have made admirable proof in him;</a>
<a id='line_12653'></a>
<a id='line_12654'>But so much more malignant and more savage</a>
<a id='line_12655'>    Becomes the land untilled and with bad seed,</a>
<a id='line_12656'>    The more good earthly vigour it possesses.</a>
<a id='line_12657'></a>
<a id='line_12658'>Some time did I sustain him with my look;</a>
<a id='line_12659'>    Revealing unto him my youthful eyes,</a>
<a id='line_12660'>    I led him with me turned in the right way.</a>
<a id='line_12661'></a>
<a id='line_12662'>As soon as ever of my second age</a>
<a id='line_12663'>    I was upon the threshold and changed life,</a>
<a id='line_12664'>    Himself from me he took and gave to others.</a>
<a id='line_12665'></a>
<a id='line_12666'>When from the flesh to spirit I ascended,</a>
<a id='line_12667'>    And beauty and virtue were in me increased,</a>
<a id='line_12668'>    I was to him less dear and less delightful;</a>
<a id='line_12669'></a>
<a id='line_12670'>And into ways untrue he turned his steps,</a>
<a id='line_12671'>    Pursuing the false images of good,</a>
<a id='line_12672'>    That never any promises fulfil;</a>
<a id='line_12673'></a>
<a id='line_12674'>Nor prayer for inspiration me availed,</a>
<a id='line_12675'>    By means of which in dreams and otherwise</a>
<a id='line_12676'>    I called him back, so little did he heed them.</a>
<a id='line_12677'></a>
<a id='line_12678'>So low he fell, that all appliances</a>
<a id='line_12679'>    For his salvation were already short,</a>
<a id='line_12680'>    Save showing him the people of perdition.</a>
<a id='line_12681'></a>
<a id='line_12682'>For this I visited the gates of death,</a>
<a id='line_12683'>    And unto him, who so far up has led him,</a>
<a id='line_12684'>    My intercessions were with weeping borne.</a>
<a id='line_12685'></a>
<a id='line_12686'>God’s lofty fiat would be violated,</a>
<a id='line_12687'>    If Lethe should be passed, and if such viands</a>
<a id='line_12688'>    Should tasted be, withouten any scot</a>
<a id='line_12689'></a>
<a id='line_12690'>Of penitence, that gushes forth in tears.”</a>
<a id='line_12691'></a>
<a id='line_12692'></a>

<a id='line_12695'>Purgatorio: Canto XXXI</a>
<a id='line_12696'></a>
<a id='line_12697'></a>
<a id='line_12698'>“O thou who art beyond the sacred river,”</a>
<a id='line_12699'>    Turning to me the point of her discourse,</a>
<a id='line_12700'>    That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen,</a>
<a id='line_12701'></a>
<a id='line_12702'>She recommenced, continuing without pause,</a>
<a id='line_12703'>    “Say, say if this be true; to such a charge,</a>
<a id='line_12704'>    Thy own confession needs must be conjoined.”</a>
<a id='line_12705'></a>
<a id='line_12706'>My faculties were in so great confusion,</a>
<a id='line_12707'>    That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct</a>
<a id='line_12708'>    Than by its organs it was set at large.</a>
<a id='line_12709'></a>
<a id='line_12710'>Awhile she waited; then she said: “What thinkest?</a>
<a id='line_12711'>    Answer me; for the mournful memories</a>
<a id='line_12712'>    In thee not yet are by the waters injured.”</a>
<a id='line_12713'></a>
<a id='line_12714'>Confusion and dismay together mingled</a>
<a id='line_12715'>    Forced such a Yes! from out my mouth, that sight</a>
<a id='line_12716'>    Was needful to the understanding of it.</a>
<a id='line_12717'></a>
<a id='line_12718'>Even as a cross-bow breaks, when ’tis discharged</a>
<a id='line_12719'>    Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow,</a>
<a id='line_12720'>    And with less force the arrow hits the mark,</a>
<a id='line_12721'></a>
<a id='line_12722'>So I gave way beneath that heavy burden,</a>
<a id='line_12723'>    Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs,</a>
<a id='line_12724'>    And the voice flagged upon its passage forth.</a>
<a id='line_12725'></a>
<a id='line_12726'>Whence she to me: “In those desires of mine</a>
<a id='line_12727'>    Which led thee to the loving of that good,</a>
<a id='line_12728'>    Beyond which there is nothing to aspire to,</a>
<a id='line_12729'></a>
<a id='line_12730'>What trenches lying traverse or what chains</a>
<a id='line_12731'>    Didst thou discover, that of passing onward</a>
<a id='line_12732'>    Thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope?</a>
<a id='line_12733'></a>
<a id='line_12734'>And what allurements or what vantages</a>
<a id='line_12735'>    Upon the forehead of the others showed,</a>
<a id='line_12736'>    That thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them?”</a>
<a id='line_12737'></a>
<a id='line_12738'>After the heaving of a bitter sigh,</a>
<a id='line_12739'>    Hardly had I the voice to make response,</a>
<a id='line_12740'>    And with fatigue my lips did fashion it.</a>
<a id='line_12741'></a>
<a id='line_12742'>Weeping I said: “The things that present were</a>
<a id='line_12743'>    With their false pleasure turned aside my steps,</a>
<a id='line_12744'>    Soon as your countenance concealed itself.”</a>
<a id='line_12745'></a>
<a id='line_12746'>And she: “Shouldst thou be silent, or deny</a>
<a id='line_12747'>    What thou confessest, not less manifest</a>
<a id='line_12748'>    Would be thy fault, by such a Judge ’tis known.</a>
<a id='line_12749'></a>
<a id='line_12750'>But when from one’s own cheeks comes bursting forth</a>
<a id='line_12751'>    The accusal of the sin, in our tribunal</a>
<a id='line_12752'>    Against the edge the wheel doth turn itself.</a>
<a id='line_12753'></a>
<a id='line_12754'>But still, that thou mayst feel a greater shame</a>
<a id='line_12755'>    For thy transgression, and another time</a>
<a id='line_12756'>    Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong,</a>
<a id='line_12757'></a>
<a id='line_12758'>Cast down the seed of weeping and attend;</a>
<a id='line_12759'>    So shalt thou hear, how in an opposite way</a>
<a id='line_12760'>    My buried flesh should have directed thee.</a>
<a id='line_12761'></a>
<a id='line_12762'>Never to thee presented art or nature</a>
<a id='line_12763'>    Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein</a>
<a id='line_12764'>    I was enclosed, which scattered are in earth.</a>
<a id='line_12765'></a>
<a id='line_12766'>And if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee</a>
<a id='line_12767'>    By reason of my death, what mortal thing</a>
<a id='line_12768'>    Should then have drawn thee into its desire?</a>
<a id='line_12769'></a>
<a id='line_12770'>Thou oughtest verily at the first shaft</a>
<a id='line_12771'>    Of things fallacious to have risen up</a>
<a id='line_12772'>    To follow me, who was no longer such.</a>
<a id='line_12773'></a>
<a id='line_12774'>Thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward</a>
<a id='line_12775'>    To wait for further blows, or little girl,</a>
<a id='line_12776'>    Or other vanity of such brief use.</a>
<a id='line_12777'></a>
<a id='line_12778'>The callow birdlet waits for two or three,</a>
<a id='line_12779'>    But to the eyes of those already fledged,</a>
<a id='line_12780'>    In vain the net is spread or shaft is shot.”</a>
<a id='line_12781'></a>
<a id='line_12782'>Even as children silent in their shame</a>
<a id='line_12783'>    Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground,</a>
<a id='line_12784'>    And conscious of their fault, and penitent;</a>
<a id='line_12785'></a>
<a id='line_12786'>So was I standing; and she said: “If thou</a>
<a id='line_12787'>    In hearing sufferest pain, lift up thy beard</a>
<a id='line_12788'>    And thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing.”</a>
<a id='line_12789'></a>
<a id='line_12790'>With less resistance is a robust holm</a>
<a id='line_12791'>    Uprooted, either by a native wind</a>
<a id='line_12792'>    Or else by that from regions of Iarbas,</a>
<a id='line_12793'></a>
<a id='line_12794'>Than I upraised at her command my chin;</a>
<a id='line_12795'>    And when she by the beard the face demanded,</a>
<a id='line_12796'>    Well I perceived the venom of her meaning.</a>
<a id='line_12797'></a>
<a id='line_12798'>And as my countenance was lifted up,</a>
<a id='line_12799'>    Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful</a>
<a id='line_12800'>    Had rested from the strewing of the flowers;</a>
<a id='line_12801'></a>
<a id='line_12802'>And, still but little reassured, mine eyes</a>
<a id='line_12803'>    Saw Beatrice turned round towards the monster,</a>
<a id='line_12804'>    That is one person only in two natures.</a>
<a id='line_12805'></a>
<a id='line_12806'>Beneath her veil, beyond the margent green,</a>
<a id='line_12807'>    She seemed to me far more her ancient self</a>
<a id='line_12808'>    To excel, than others here, when she was here.</a>
<a id='line_12809'></a>
<a id='line_12810'>So pricked me then the thorn of penitence,</a>
<a id='line_12811'>    That of all other things the one which turned me</a>
<a id='line_12812'>    Most to its love became the most my foe.</a>
<a id='line_12813'></a>
<a id='line_12814'>Such self-conviction stung me at the heart</a>
<a id='line_12815'>    O’erpowered I fell, and what I then became</a>
<a id='line_12816'>    She knoweth who had furnished me the cause.</a>
<a id='line_12817'></a>
<a id='line_12818'>Then, when the heart restored my outward sense,</a>
<a id='line_12819'>    The lady I had found alone, above me</a>
<a id='line_12820'>    I saw, and she was saying, “Hold me, hold me.”</a>
<a id='line_12821'></a>
<a id='line_12822'>Up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me,</a>
<a id='line_12823'>    And, dragging me behind her, she was moving</a>
<a id='line_12824'>    Upon the water lightly as a shuttle.</a>
<a id='line_12825'></a>
<a id='line_12826'>When I was near unto the blessed shore,</a>
<a id='line_12827'>    “Asperges me,” I heard so sweetly sung,</a>
<a id='line_12828'>    Remember it I cannot, much less write it.</a>
<a id='line_12829'></a>
<a id='line_12830'>The beautiful lady opened wide her arms,</a>
<a id='line_12831'>    Embraced my head, and plunged me underneath,</a>
<a id='line_12832'>    Where I was forced to swallow of the water.</a>
<a id='line_12833'></a>
<a id='line_12834'>Then forth she drew me, and all dripping brought</a>
<a id='line_12835'>    Into the dance of the four beautiful,</a>
<a id='line_12836'>    And each one with her arm did cover me.</a>
<a id='line_12837'></a>
<a id='line_12838'>‘We here are Nymphs, and in the Heaven are stars;</a>

<a id='line_12845'></a>
<a id='line_12846'>Thus singing they began; and afterwards</a>
<a id='line_12847'>    Unto the Griffin’s breast they led me with them,</a>

<a id='line_12873'></a>

<a id='line_12929'></a>
<a id='line_12930'>Then to the wheels the maidens turned themselves,</a>

<a id='line_12933'></a>
<a id='line_12934'>The lady fair who drew me through the ford</a>

<a id='line_12937'></a>
<a id='line_12938'>So passing through the lofty forest, vacant</a>
<a id='line_12939'>    By fault of her who in the serpent trusted,</a>
<a id='line_12940'>    Angelic music made our steps keep time.</a>
<a id='line_12941'></a>
<a id='line_12942'>Perchance as great a space had in three flights</a>
<a id='line_12943'>    An arrow loosened from the string o’erpassed,</a>
<a id='line_12944'>    As we had moved when Beatrice descended.</a>
<a id='line_12945'></a>
<a id='line_12946'>I heard them murmur altogether, “Adam!”</a>
<a id='line_12947'>    Then circled they about a tree despoiled</a>
<a id='line_12948'>    Of blooms and other leafage on each bough.</a>
<a id='line_12949'></a>
<a id='line_12950'>Its tresses, which so much the more dilate</a>

<a id='line_12957'></a>
<a id='line_12958'>After this fashion round the tree robust</a>
<a id='line_12959'>    The others shouted; and the twofold creature:</a>

<a id='line_12961'></a>
<a id='line_12962'>And turning to the pole which he had dragged,</a>
<a id='line_12963'>    He drew it close beneath the widowed bough,</a>
<a id='line_12964'>    And what was of it unto it left bound.</a>
<a id='line_12965'></a>
<a id='line_12966'>In the same manner as our trees (when downward</a>

<a id='line_12973'></a>
<a id='line_12974'>Less than of rose and more than violet</a>
<a id='line_12975'>    A hue disclosing, was renewed the tree</a>
<a id='line_12976'>    That had erewhile its boughs so desolate.</a>
<a id='line_12977'></a>
<a id='line_12978'>I never heard, nor here below is sung,</a>

<a id='line_12981'></a>
<a id='line_12982'>Had I the power to paint how fell asleep</a>
<a id='line_12983'>    Those eyes compassionless, of Syrinx hearing,</a>
<a id='line_12984'>    Those eyes to which more watching cost so dear,</a>
<a id='line_12985'></a>
<a id='line_12986'>Even as a painter who from model paints</a>

<a id='line_12988'>    He may, who well can picture drowsihood.</a>
<a id='line_12989'></a>
<a id='line_12990'>Therefore I pass to what time I awoke,</a>
<a id='line_12991'>    And say a splendour rent from me the veil</a>
<a id='line_12992'>    Of slumber, and a calling: “Rise, what dost thou?”</a>
<a id='line_12993'></a>
<a id='line_12994'>As to behold the apple-tree in blossom</a>
<a id='line_12995'>    Which makes the Angels greedy for its fruit,</a>
<a id='line_12996'>    And keeps perpetual bridals in the Heaven,</a>
<a id='line_12997'></a>
<a id='line_12998'>Peter and John and James conducted were,</a>
<a id='line_12999'>    And, overcome, recovered at the word</a>
<a id='line_13000'>    By which still greater slumbers have been broken,</a>
<a id='line_13001'></a>
<a id='line_13002'>And saw their school diminished by the loss</a>
<a id='line_13003'>    Not only of Elias, but of Moses,</a>
<a id='line_13004'>    And the apparel of their Master changed;</a>
<a id='line_13005'></a>
<a id='line_13006'>So I revived, and saw that piteous one</a>
<a id='line_13007'>    Above me standing, who had been conductress</a>
<a id='line_13008'>    Aforetime of my steps beside the river,</a>
<a id='line_13009'></a>
<a id='line_13010'>And all in doubt I said, “Where’s Beatrice?”</a>
<a id='line_13011'>    And she: “Behold her seated underneath</a>
<a id='line_13012'>    The leafage new, upon the root of it.</a>
<a id='line_13013'></a>
<a id='line_13014'>Behold the company that circles her;</a>
<a id='line_13015'>    The rest behind the Griffin are ascending</a>
<a id='line_13016'>    With more melodious song, and more profound.”</a>
<a id='line_13017'></a>
<a id='line_13018'>And if her speech were more diffuse I know not,</a>
<a id='line_13019'>    Because already in my sight was she</a>
<a id='line_13020'>    Who from the hearing of aught else had shut me.</a>
<a id='line_13021'></a>
<a id='line_13022'>Alone she sat upon the very earth,</a>
<a id='line_13023'>    Left there as guardian of the chariot</a>
<a id='line_13024'>    Which I had seen the biform monster fasten.</a>
<a id='line_13025'></a>
<a id='line_13026'>Encircling her, a cloister made themselves</a>
<a id='line_13027'>    The seven Nymphs, with those lights in their hands</a>
<a id='line_13028'>    Which are secure from Aquilon and Auster.</a>
<a id='line_13029'></a>
<a id='line_13030'>“Short while shalt thou be here a forester,</a>
<a id='line_13031'>    And thou shalt be with me for evermore</a>
<a id='line_13032'>    A citizen of that Rome where Christ is Roman.</a>
<a id='line_13033'></a>
<a id='line_13034'>Therefore, for that world’s good which liveth ill,</a>
<a id='line_13035'>    Fix on the car thine eyes, and what thou seest,</a>
<a id='line_13036'>    Having returned to earth, take heed thou write.”</a>
<a id='line_13037'></a>
<a id='line_13038'>Thus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet</a>
<a id='line_13039'>    Of her commandments all devoted was,</a>
<a id='line_13040'>    My mind and eyes directed where she willed.</a>
<a id='line_13041'></a>
<a id='line_13042'>Never descended with so swift a motion</a>
<a id='line_13043'>    Fire from a heavy cloud, when it is raining</a>
<a id='line_13044'>    From out the region which is most remote,</a>
<a id='line_13045'></a>
<a id='line_13046'>As I beheld the bird of Jove descend</a>
<a id='line_13047'>    Down through the tree, rending away the bark,</a>
<a id='line_13048'>    As well as blossoms and the foliage new,</a>
<a id='line_13049'></a>
<a id='line_13050'>And he with all his might the chariot smote,</a>
<a id='line_13051'>    Whereat it reeled, like vessel in a tempest</a>
<a id='line_13052'>    Tossed by the waves, now starboard and now larboard.</a>
<a id='line_13053'></a>
<a id='line_13054'>Thereafter saw I leap into the body</a>
<a id='line_13055'>    Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox,</a>
<a id='line_13056'>    That seemed unfed with any wholesome food.</a>
<a id='line_13057'></a>
<a id='line_13058'>But for his hideous sins upbraiding him,</a>
<a id='line_13059'>    My Lady put him to as swift a flight</a>
<a id='line_13060'>    As such a fleshless skeleton could bear.</a>
<a id='line_13061'></a>
<a id='line_13062'>Then by the way that it before had come,</a>
<a id='line_13063'>    Into the chariot’s chest I saw the Eagle</a>
<a id='line_13064'>    Descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes.</a>
<a id='line_13065'></a>
<a id='line_13066'>And such as issues from a heart that mourns,</a>
<a id='line_13067'>    A voice from Heaven there issued, and it said:</a>
<a id='line_13068'>    “My little bark, how badly art thou freighted!”</a>
<a id='line_13069'></a>
<a id='line_13070'>Methought, then, that the earth did yawn between</a>
<a id='line_13071'>    Both wheels, and I saw rise from it a Dragon,</a>
<a id='line_13072'>    Who through the chariot upward fixed his tail,</a>
<a id='line_13073'></a>
<a id='line_13074'>And as a wasp that draweth back its sting,</a>
<a id='line_13075'>    Drawing unto himself his tail malign,</a>
<a id='line_13076'>    Drew out the floor, and went his way rejoicing.</a>
<a id='line_13077'></a>
<a id='line_13078'>That which remained behind, even as with grass</a>
<a id='line_13079'>    A fertile region, with the feathers, offered</a>
<a id='line_13080'>    Perhaps with pure intention and benign,</a>
<a id='line_13081'></a>
<a id='line_13082'>Reclothed itself, and with them were reclothed</a>
<a id='line_13083'>    The pole and both the wheels so speedily,</a>
<a id='line_13084'>    A sigh doth longer keep the lips apart.</a>
<a id='line_13085'></a>
<a id='line_13086'>Transfigured thus the holy edifice</a>
<a id='line_13087'>    Thrust forward heads upon the parts of it,</a>
<a id='line_13088'>    Three on the pole and one at either corner.</a>
<a id='line_13089'></a>
<a id='line_13090'>The first were horned like oxen; but the four</a>
<a id='line_13091'>    Had but a single horn upon the forehead;</a>
<a id='line_13092'>    A monster such had never yet been seen!</a>
<a id='line_13093'></a>
<a id='line_13094'>Firm as a rock upon a mountain high,</a>
<a id='line_13095'>    Seated upon it, there appeared to me</a>
<a id='line_13096'>    A shameless whore, with eyes swift glancing round,</a>
<a id='line_13097'></a>
<a id='line_13098'>And, as if not to have her taken from him,</a>
<a id='line_13099'>    Upright beside her I beheld a giant;</a>
<a id='line_13100'>    And ever and anon they kissed each other.</a>
<a id='line_13101'></a>
<a id='line_13102'>But because she her wanton, roving eye</a>
<a id='line_13103'>    Turned upon me, her angry paramour</a>
<a id='line_13104'>    Did scourge her from her head unto her feet.</a>
<a id='line_13105'></a>
<a id='line_13106'>Then full of jealousy, and fierce with wrath,</a>
<a id='line_13107'>    He loosed the monster, and across the forest</a>
<a id='line_13108'>    Dragged it so far, he made of that alone</a>
<a id='line_13109'></a>
<a id='line_13110'>A shield unto the whore and the strange beast.</a>
<a id='line_13111'></a>

<a id='line_13119'>    Now three, now four, melodious psalmody</a>

<a id='line_13121'></a>

<a id='line_13124'>    That scarce more changed was Mary at the cross.</a>
<a id='line_13125'></a>
<a id='line_13126'>But when the other virgins place had given</a>
<a id='line_13127'>    For her to speak, uprisen to her feet</a>
<a id='line_13128'>    With colour as of fire, she made response:</a>

<a id='line_13145'></a>
<a id='line_13146'>As soon as I was with her as I should be,</a>

<a id='line_13814'></a>
<a id='line_13815'>“Brother, our will is quieted by virtue</a>
<a id='line_13816'>    Of charity, that makes us wish alone</a>
<a id='line_13817'>    For what we have, nor gives us thirst for more.</a>
<a id='line_13818'></a>
<a id='line_13819'>If to be more exalted we aspired,</a>
<a id='line_13820'>    Discordant would our aspirations be</a>
<a id='line_13821'>    Unto the will of Him who here secludes us;</a>
<a id='line_13822'></a>
<a id='line_13823'>Which thou shalt see finds no place in these circles,</a>
<a id='line_13824'>    If being in charity is needful here,</a>
<a id='line_13825'>    And if thou lookest well into its nature;</a>
<a id='line_13826'></a>
<a id='line_13827'>Nay, ’tis essential to this blest existence</a>
<a id='line_13828'>    To keep itself within the will divine,</a>
<a id='line_13829'>    Whereby our very wishes are made one;</a>
<a id='line_13830'></a>
<a id='line_13831'>So that, as we are station above station</a>
<a id='line_13832'>    Throughout this realm, to all the realm ’tis pleasing,</a>
<a id='line_13833'>    As to the King, who makes his will our will.</a>
<a id='line_13834'></a>
<a id='line_13835'>And his will is our peace; this is the sea</a>
<a id='line_13836'>    To which is moving onward whatsoever</a>
<a id='line_13837'>    It doth create, and all that nature makes.”</a>
<a id='line_13838'></a>
<a id='line_13839'>Then it was clear to me how everywhere</a>
<a id='line_13840'>    In heaven is Paradise, although the grace</a>
<a id='line_13841'>    Of good supreme there rain not in one measure.</a>
<a id='line_13842'></a>
<a id='line_13843'>But as it comes to pass, if one food sates,</a>
<a id='line_13844'>    And for another still remains the longing,</a>
<a id='line_13845'>    We ask for this, and that decline with thanks,</a>
<a id='line_13846'></a>
<a id='line_13847'>E’en thus did I; with gesture and with word,</a>
<a id='line_13848'>    To learn from her what was the web wherein</a>
<a id='line_13849'>    She did not ply the shuttle to the end.</a>
<a id='line_13850'></a>
<a id='line_13851'>“A perfect life and merit high in-heaven</a>
<a id='line_13852'>    A lady o’er us,” said she, “by whose rule</a>
<a id='line_13853'>    Down in your world they vest and veil themselves,</a>
<a id='line_13854'></a>
<a id='line_13855'>That until death they may both watch and sleep</a>
<a id='line_13856'>    Beside that Spouse who every vow accepts</a>
<a id='line_13857'>    Which charity conformeth to his pleasure.</a>
<a id='line_13858'></a>
<a id='line_13859'>To follow her, in girlhood from the world</a>
<a id='line_13860'>    I fled, and in her habit shut myself,</a>
<a id='line_13861'>    And pledged me to the pathway of her sect.</a>
<a id='line_13862'></a>
<a id='line_13863'>Then men accustomed unto evil more</a>
<a id='line_13864'>    Than unto good, from the sweet cloister tore me;</a>
<a id='line_13865'>    God knows what afterward my life became.</a>
<a id='line_13866'></a>
<a id='line_13867'>This other splendour, which to thee reveals</a>

<a id='line_13870'></a>
<a id='line_13871'>What of myself I say applies to her;</a>
<a id='line_13872'>    A nun was she, and likewise from her head</a>
<a id='line_13873'>    Was ta’en the shadow of the sacred wimple.</a>
<a id='line_13874'></a>
<a id='line_13875'>But when she too was to the world returned</a>
<a id='line_13876'>    Against her wishes and against good usage,</a>
<a id='line_13877'>    Of the heart’s veil she never was divested.</a>
<a id='line_13878'></a>
<a id='line_13879'>Of great Costanza this is the effulgence,</a>
<a id='line_13880'>    Who from the second wind of Suabia</a>
<a id='line_13881'>    Brought forth the third and latest puissance.”</a>
<a id='line_13882'></a>
<a id='line_13883'>Thus unto me she spake, and then began</a>
<a id='line_13884'>    “Ave Maria” singing, and in singing</a>
<a id='line_13885'>    Vanished, as through deep water something heavy.</a>
<a id='line_13886'></a>
<a id='line_13887'>My sight, that followed her as long a time</a>
<a id='line_13888'>    As it was possible, when it had lost her</a>
<a id='line_13889'>    Turned round unto the mark of more desire,</a>
<a id='line_13890'></a>
<a id='line_13891'>And wholly unto Beatrice reverted;</a>
<a id='line_13892'>    But she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes,</a>
<a id='line_13893'>    That at the first my sight endured it not;</a>
<a id='line_13894'></a>

<a id='line_13902'></a>
<a id='line_13903'>Between two viands, equally removed</a>
<a id='line_13904'>    And tempting, a free man would die of hunger</a>
<a id='line_13905'>    Ere either he could bring unto his teeth.</a>
<a id='line_13906'></a>

<a id='line_13913'>    Since it must be so, nor do I commend.</a>
<a id='line_13914'></a>
<a id='line_13915'>I held my peace; but my desire was painted</a>
<a id='line_13916'>    Upon my face, and questioning with that</a>
<a id='line_13917'>    More fervent far than by articulate speech.</a>
<a id='line_13918'></a>

<a id='line_13950'></a>
<a id='line_13951'>They showed themselves here, not because allotted</a>
<a id='line_13952'>    This sphere has been to them, but to give sign</a>
<a id='line_13953'>    Of the celestial which is least exalted.</a>
<a id='line_13954'></a>
<a id='line_13955'>To speak thus is adapted to your mind,</a>
<a id='line_13956'>    Since only through the sense it apprehendeth</a>
<a id='line_13957'>    What then it worthy makes of intellect.</a>
<a id='line_13958'></a>
<a id='line_13959'>On this account the Scripture condescends</a>

<a id='line_13967'>That which Timaeus argues of the soul</a>
<a id='line_13968'>    Doth not resemble that which here is seen,</a>
<a id='line_13969'>    Because it seems that as he speaks he thinks.</a>
<a id='line_13970'></a>
<a id='line_13971'>He says the soul unto its star returns,</a>
<a id='line_13972'>    Believing it to have been severed thence</a>
<a id='line_13973'>    Whenever nature gave it as a form.</a>
<a id='line_13974'></a>
<a id='line_13975'>Perhaps his doctrine is of other guise</a>

<a id='line_13990'></a>
<a id='line_13991'>That as unjust our justice should appear</a>
<a id='line_13992'>    In eyes of mortals, is an argument</a>
<a id='line_13993'>    Of faith, and not of sin heretical.</a>
<a id='line_13994'></a>
<a id='line_13995'>But still, that your perception may be able</a>
<a id='line_13996'>    To thoroughly penetrate this verity,</a>
<a id='line_13997'>    As thou desirest, I will satisfy thee.</a>
<a id='line_13998'></a>
<a id='line_13999'>If it be violence when he who suffers</a>
<a id='line_14000'>    Co-operates not with him who uses force,</a>
<a id='line_14001'>    These souls were not on that account excused;</a>
<a id='line_14002'></a>
<a id='line_14003'>For will is never quenched unless it will,</a>
<a id='line_14004'>    But operates as nature doth in fire</a>
<a id='line_14005'>    If violence a thousand times distort it.</a>
<a id='line_14006'></a>
<a id='line_14007'>Hence, if it yieldeth more or less, it seconds</a>
<a id='line_14008'>    The force; and these have done so, having power</a>
<a id='line_14009'>    Of turning back unto the holy place.</a>
<a id='line_14010'></a>
<a id='line_14011'>If their will had been perfect, like to that</a>
<a id='line_14012'>    Which Lawrence fast upon his gridiron held,</a>
<a id='line_14013'>    And Mutius made severe to his own hand,</a>
<a id='line_14014'></a>
<a id='line_14015'>It would have urged them back along the road</a>
<a id='line_14016'>    Whence they were dragged, as soon as they were free;</a>
<a id='line_14017'>    But such a solid will is all too rare.</a>
<a id='line_14018'></a>
<a id='line_14019'>And by these words, if thou hast gathered them</a>
<a id='line_14020'>    As thou shouldst do, the argument is refuted</a>
<a id='line_14021'>    That would have still annoyed thee many times.</a>
<a id='line_14022'></a>
<a id='line_14023'>But now another passage runs across</a>
<a id='line_14024'>    Before thine eyes, and such that by thyself</a>
<a id='line_14025'>    Thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary.</a>
<a id='line_14026'></a>
<a id='line_14027'>I have for certain put into thy mind</a>
<a id='line_14028'>    That soul beatified could never lie,</a>
<a id='line_14029'>    For it is near the primal Truth,</a>
<a id='line_14030'></a>
<a id='line_14031'>And then thou from Piccarda might’st have heard</a>
<a id='line_14032'>    Costanza kept affection for the veil,</a>
<a id='line_14033'>    So that she seemeth here to contradict me.</a>
<a id='line_14034'></a>
<a id='line_14035'>Many times, brother, has it come to pass,</a>
<a id='line_14036'>    That, to escape from peril, with reluctance</a>
<a id='line_14037'>    That has been done it was not right to do,</a>
<a id='line_14038'></a>
<a id='line_14039'>E’en as Alcmaeon (who, being by his father</a>
<a id='line_14040'>    Thereto entreated, his own mother slew)</a>
<a id='line_14041'>    Not to lose pity pitiless became.</a>
<a id='line_14042'></a>
<a id='line_14043'>At this point I desire thee to remember</a>
<a id='line_14044'>    That force with will commingles, and they cause</a>
<a id='line_14045'>    That the offences cannot be excused.</a>
<a id='line_14046'></a>
<a id='line_14047'>Will absolute consenteth not to evil;</a>
<a id='line_14048'>    But in so far consenteth as it fears,</a>
<a id='line_14049'>    If it refrain, to fall into more harm.</a>
<a id='line_14050'></a>
<a id='line_14051'>Hence when Piccarda uses this expression,</a>
<a id='line_14052'>    She meaneth the will absolute, and I</a>
<a id='line_14053'>    The other, so that both of us speak truth.”</a>
<a id='line_14054'></a>
<a id='line_14055'>Such was the flowing of the holy river</a>
<a id='line_14056'>    That issued from the fount whence springs all truth;</a>
<a id='line_14057'>    This put to rest my wishes one and all.</a>
<a id='line_14058'></a>
<a id='line_14059'>“O love of the first lover, O divine,”</a>
<a id='line_14060'>    Said I forthwith, “whose speech inundates me</a>

<a id='line_14062'></a>
<a id='line_14063'>My own affection is not so profound</a>
<a id='line_14064'>    As to suffice in rendering grace for grace;</a>
<a id='line_14065'>    Let Him, who sees and can, thereto respond.</a>
<a id='line_14066'></a>
<a id='line_14067'>Well I perceive that never sated is</a>

<a id='line_14069'>    Beyond which nothing true expands itself.</a>
<a id='line_14070'></a>
<a id='line_14071'>It rests therein, as wild beast in his lair,</a>
<a id='line_14072'>    When it attains it; and it can attain it;</a>
<a id='line_14073'>    If not, then each desire would frustrate be.</a>
<a id='line_14074'></a>
<a id='line_14075'>Therefore springs up, in fashion of a shoot,</a>
<a id='line_14076'>    Doubt at the foot of truth; and this is nature,</a>
<a id='line_14077'>    Which to the top from height to height impels us.</a>
<a id='line_14078'></a>
<a id='line_14079'>This doth invite me, this assurance give me</a>
<a id='line_14080'>    With reverence, Lady, to inquire of you</a>
<a id='line_14081'>    Another truth, which is obscure to me.</a>
<a id='line_14082'></a>
<a id='line_14083'>I wish to know if man can satisfy you</a>

<a id='line_14086'></a>
<a id='line_14087'>Beatrice gazed upon me with her eyes</a>
<a id='line_14088'>    Full of the sparks of love, and so divine,</a>

<a id='line_14118'></a>

<a id='line_14128'>    Wherewith the creatures of intelligence</a>
<a id='line_14129'>    Both all and only were and are endowed.</a>
<a id='line_14130'></a>
<a id='line_14131'>Now wilt thou see, if thence thou reasonest,</a>
<a id='line_14132'>    The high worth of a vow, if it he made</a>

<a id='line_14146'></a>

<a id='line_14154'></a>
<a id='line_14155'>In the essence of this sacrifice two things</a>

<a id='line_14161'>    With such precision has above been spoken.</a>
<a id='line_14162'></a>

<a id='line_14166'></a>
<a id='line_14167'>The other, which is known to thee as matter,</a>

<a id='line_14170'></a>

<a id='line_14181'>    Cannot be satisfied with other spending.</a>
<a id='line_14182'></a>

<a id='line_14210'></a>
<a id='line_14211'>Thus Beatrice to me even as I write it;</a>
<a id='line_14212'>    Then all desireful turned herself again</a>

<a id='line_14214'></a>
<a id='line_14215'>Her silence and her change of countenance</a>
<a id='line_14216'>    Silence imposed upon my eager mind,</a>
<a id='line_14217'>    That had already in advance new questions;</a>
<a id='line_14218'></a>
<a id='line_14219'>And as an arrow that upon the mark</a>
<a id='line_14220'>    Strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become,</a>
<a id='line_14221'>    So did we speed into the second realm.</a>
<a id='line_14222'></a>
<a id='line_14223'>My Lady there so joyful I beheld,</a>
<a id='line_14224'>    As into the brightness of that heaven she entered,</a>
<a id='line_14225'>    More luminous thereat the planet grew;</a>
<a id='line_14226'></a>
<a id='line_14227'>And if the star itself was changed and smiled,</a>
<a id='line_14228'>    What became I, who by my nature am</a>
<a id='line_14229'>    Exceeding mutable in every guise!</a>
<a id='line_14230'></a>

<a id='line_14234'></a>
<a id='line_14235'>So I beheld more than a thousand splendours</a>
<a id='line_14236'>    Drawing towards us, and in each was heard:</a>
<a id='line_14237'>    “Lo, this is she who shall increase our love.”</a>
<a id='line_14238'></a>
<a id='line_14239'>And as each one was coming unto us,</a>
<a id='line_14240'>    Full of beatitude the shade was seen,</a>
<a id='line_14241'>    By the effulgence clear that issued from it.</a>
<a id='line_14242'></a>
<a id='line_14243'>Think, Reader, if what here is just beginning</a>
<a id='line_14244'>    No farther should proceed, how thou wouldst have</a>
<a id='line_14245'>    An agonizing need of knowing more;</a>
<a id='line_14246'></a>
<a id='line_14247'>And of thyself thou’lt see how I from these</a>

<a id='line_14258'></a>
<a id='line_14259'>Thus by some one among those holy spirits</a>
<a id='line_14260'>    Was spoken, and by Beatrice: “Speak, speak</a>
<a id='line_14261'>    Securely, and believe them even as Gods.”</a>
<a id='line_14262'></a>
<a id='line_14263'>“Well I perceive how thou dost nest thyself</a>

<a id='line_14266'></a>

<a id='line_14270'></a>
<a id='line_14271'>This said I in direction of the light</a>
<a id='line_14272'>    Which first had spoken to me; whence it became</a>
<a id='line_14273'>    By far more lucent than it was before.</a>
<a id='line_14274'></a>
<a id='line_14275'>Even as the sun, that doth conceal himself</a>

<a id='line_14277'>    The tempering influence of the vapours dense,</a>

<a id='line_14608'>    Had pardon granted, or that man himself</a>
<a id='line_14609'>    Had satisfaction for his folly made.</a>
<a id='line_14610'></a>

<a id='line_15804'>    ‘Then in what way was he without a peer?’</a>
<a id='line_15805'>    Would be the first beginning of thy words.</a>
<a id='line_15806'></a>
<a id='line_15807'>But, that may well appear what now appears not,</a>
<a id='line_15808'>    Think who he was, and what occasion moved him</a>
<a id='line_15809'>    To make request, when it was told him, ‘Ask.’</a>
<a id='line_15810'></a>
<a id='line_15811'>I’ve not so spoken that thou canst not see</a>
<a id='line_15812'>    Clearly he was a king who asked for wisdom,</a>
<a id='line_15813'>    That he might be sufficiently a king;</a>
<a id='line_15814'></a>
<a id='line_15815'>’Twas not to know the number in which are</a>

<a id='line_15822'></a>
<a id='line_15823'>Whence, if thou notest this and what I said,</a>
<a id='line_15824'>    A regal prudence is that peerless seeing</a>
<a id='line_15825'>    In which the shaft of my intention strikes.</a>
<a id='line_15826'></a>
<a id='line_15827'>And if on ‘rose’ thou turnest thy clear eyes,</a>
<a id='line_15828'>    Thou’lt see that it has reference alone</a>
<a id='line_15829'>    To kings who’re many, and the good are rare.</a>
<a id='line_15830'></a>
<a id='line_15831'>With this distinction take thou what I said,</a>
<a id='line_15832'>    And thus it can consist with thy belief</a>
<a id='line_15833'>    Of the first father and of our Delight.</a>
<a id='line_15834'></a>
<a id='line_15835'>And lead shall this be always to thy feet,</a>
<a id='line_15836'>    To make thee, like a weary man, move slowly</a>
<a id='line_15837'>    Both to the Yes and No thou seest not;</a>
<a id='line_15838'></a>
<a id='line_15839'>For very low among the fools is he</a>
<a id='line_15840'>    Who affirms without distinction, or denies,</a>
<a id='line_15841'>    As well in one as in the other case;</a>
<a id='line_15842'></a>
<a id='line_15843'>Because it happens that full often bends</a>
<a id='line_15844'>    Current opinion in the false direction,</a>
<a id='line_15845'>    And then the feelings bind the intellect.</a>
<a id='line_15846'></a>
<a id='line_15847'>Far more than uselessly he leaves the shore,</a>
<a id='line_15848'>    (Since he returneth not the same he went,)</a>
<a id='line_15849'>    Who fishes for the truth, and has no skill;</a>
<a id='line_15850'></a>
<a id='line_15851'>And in the world proofs manifest thereof</a>
<a id='line_15852'>    Parmenides, Melissus, Brissus are,</a>
<a id='line_15853'>    And many who went on and knew not whither;</a>
<a id='line_15854'></a>
<a id='line_15855'>Thus did Sabellius, Arius, and those fools</a>
<a id='line_15856'>    Who have been even as swords unto the Scriptures</a>
<a id='line_15857'>    In rendering distorted their straight faces.</a>
<a id='line_15858'></a>
<a id='line_15859'>Nor yet shall people be too confident</a>

<a id='line_15866'></a>

<a id='line_15901'>    Eternally the same that it is now;</a>
<a id='line_15902'></a>
<a id='line_15903'>And if it do remain, say in what manner,</a>
<a id='line_15904'>    After ye are again made visible,</a>
<a id='line_15905'>    It can be that it injure not your sight.”</a>
<a id='line_15906'></a>
<a id='line_15907'>As by a greater gladness urged and drawn</a>
<a id='line_15908'>    They who are dancing in a ring sometimes</a>
<a id='line_15909'>    Uplift their voices and their motions quicken;</a>
<a id='line_15910'></a>
<a id='line_15911'>So, at that orison devout and prompt,</a>
<a id='line_15912'>    The holy circles a new joy displayed</a>
<a id='line_15913'>    In their revolving and their wondrous song.</a>
<a id='line_15914'></a>
<a id='line_15915'>Whoso lamenteth him that here we die</a>

<a id='line_15922'></a>
<a id='line_15923'>Three several times was chanted by each one</a>

<a id='line_15926'></a>
<a id='line_15927'>And, in the lustre most divine of all</a>
<a id='line_15928'>    The lesser ring, I heard a modest voice,</a>
<a id='line_15929'>    Such as perhaps the Angel’s was to Mary,</a>
<a id='line_15930'></a>
<a id='line_15931'>Answer: “As long as the festivity</a>

<a id='line_15934'></a>
<a id='line_15935'>Its brightness is proportioned to the ardour,</a>
<a id='line_15936'>    The ardour to the vision; and the vision</a>
<a id='line_15937'>    Equals what grace it has above its worth.</a>
<a id='line_15938'></a>
<a id='line_15939'>When, glorious and sanctified, our flesh</a>

<a id='line_15945'>    Light which enables us to look on Him;</a>
<a id='line_15946'></a>
<a id='line_15947'>Therefore the vision must perforce increase,</a>
<a id='line_15948'>    Increase the ardour which from that is kindled,</a>
<a id='line_15949'>    Increase the radiance which from this proceeds.</a>
<a id='line_15950'></a>
<a id='line_15951'>But even as a coal that sends forth flame,</a>
<a id='line_15952'>    And by its vivid whiteness overpowers it</a>
<a id='line_15953'>    So that its own appearance it maintains,</a>
<a id='line_15954'></a>
<a id='line_15955'>Thus the effulgence that surrounds us now</a>

<a id='line_15962'></a>
<a id='line_15963'>So sudden and alert appeared to me</a>
<a id='line_15964'>    Both one and the other choir to say Amen,</a>
<a id='line_15965'>    That well they showed desire for their dead bodies;</a>
<a id='line_15966'></a>
<a id='line_15967'>Nor sole for them perhaps, but for the mothers,</a>
<a id='line_15968'>    The fathers, and the rest who had been dear</a>
<a id='line_15969'>    Or ever they became eternal flames.</a>
<a id='line_15970'></a>
<a id='line_15971'>And lo! all round about of equal brightness</a>
<a id='line_15972'>    Arose a lustre over what was there,</a>
<a id='line_15973'>    Like an horizon that is clearing up.</a>
<a id='line_15974'></a>
<a id='line_15975'>And as at rise of early eve begin</a>
<a id='line_15976'>    Along the welkin new appearances,</a>
<a id='line_15977'>    So that the sight seems real and unreal,</a>
<a id='line_15978'></a>
<a id='line_15979'>It seemed to me that new subsistences</a>
<a id='line_15980'>    Began there to be seen, and make a circle</a>
<a id='line_15981'>    Outside the other two circumferences.</a>
<a id='line_15982'></a>
<a id='line_15983'>O very sparkling of the Holy Spirit,</a>
<a id='line_15984'>    How sudden and incandescent it became</a>
<a id='line_15985'>    Unto mine eyes, that vanquished bore it not!</a>
<a id='line_15986'></a>
<a id='line_15987'>But Beatrice so beautiful and smiling</a>
<a id='line_15988'>    Appeared to me, that with the other sights</a>
<a id='line_15989'>    That followed not my memory I must leave her.</a>
<a id='line_15990'></a>
<a id='line_15991'>Then to uplift themselves mine eyes resumed</a>
<a id='line_15992'>    The power, and I beheld myself translated</a>
<a id='line_15993'>    To higher salvation with my Lady only.</a>
<a id='line_15994'></a>
<a id='line_15995'>Well was I ware that I was more uplifted</a>
<a id='line_15996'>    By the enkindled smiling of the star,</a>
<a id='line_15997'>    That seemed to me more ruddy than its wont.</a>
<a id='line_15998'></a>
<a id='line_15999'>With all my heart, and in that dialect</a>
<a id='line_16000'>    Which is the same in all, such holocaust</a>
<a id='line_16001'>    To God I made as the new grace beseemed;</a>
<a id='line_16002'></a>
<a id='line_16003'>And not yet from my bosom was exhausted</a>
<a id='line_16004'>    The ardour of sacrifice, before I knew</a>
<a id='line_16005'>    This offering was accepted and auspicious;</a>
<a id='line_16006'></a>
<a id='line_16007'>For with so great a lustre and so red</a>
<a id='line_16008'>    Splendours appeared to me in twofold rays,</a>
<a id='line_16009'>    I said: “O Helios who dost so adorn them!”</a>
<a id='line_16010'></a>
<a id='line_16011'>Even as distinct with less and greater lights</a>
<a id='line_16012'>    Glimmers between the two poles of the world</a>
<a id='line_16013'>    The Galaxy that maketh wise men doubt,</a>
<a id='line_16014'></a>
<a id='line_16015'>Thus constellated in the depths of Mars,</a>
<a id='line_16016'>    Those rays described the venerable sign</a>
<a id='line_16017'>    That quadrants joining in a circle make.</a>
<a id='line_16018'></a>
<a id='line_16019'>Here doth my memory overcome my genius;</a>
<a id='line_16020'>    For on that cross as levin gleamed forth Christ,</a>
<a id='line_16021'>    So that I cannot find ensample worthy;</a>
<a id='line_16022'></a>
<a id='line_16023'>But he who takes his cross and follows Christ</a>
<a id='line_16024'>    Again will pardon me what I omit,</a>
<a id='line_16025'>    Seeing in that aurora lighten Christ.</a>
<a id='line_16026'></a>
<a id='line_16027'>From horn to horn, and ’twixt the top and base,</a>
<a id='line_16028'>    Lights were in motion, brightly scintillating</a>
<a id='line_16029'>    As they together met and passed each other;</a>
<a id='line_16030'></a>
<a id='line_16031'>Thus level and aslant and swift and slow</a>
<a id='line_16032'>    We here behold, renewing still the sight,</a>
<a id='line_16033'>    The particles of bodies long and short,</a>
<a id='line_16034'></a>
<a id='line_16035'>Across the sunbeam move, wherewith is listed</a>
<a id='line_16036'>    Sometimes the shade, which for their own defence</a>
<a id='line_16037'>    People with cunning and with art contrive.</a>
<a id='line_16038'></a>
<a id='line_16039'>And as a lute and harp, accordant strung</a>
<a id='line_16040'>    With many strings, a dulcet tinkling make</a>
<a id='line_16041'>    To him by whom the notes are not distinguished,</a>
<a id='line_16042'></a>
<a id='line_16043'>So from the lights that there to me appeared</a>
<a id='line_16044'>    Upgathered through the cross a melody,</a>
<a id='line_16045'>    Which rapt me, not distinguishing the hymn.</a>
<a id='line_16046'></a>
<a id='line_16047'>Well was I ware it was of lofty laud,</a>
<a id='line_16048'>    Because there came to me, “Arise and conquer!”</a>
<a id='line_16049'>    As unto him who hears and comprehends not.</a>
<a id='line_16050'></a>
<a id='line_16051'>So much enamoured I became therewith,</a>
<a id='line_16052'>    That until then there was not anything</a>
<a id='line_16053'>    That e’er had fettered me with such sweet bonds.</a>
<a id='line_16054'></a>
<a id='line_16055'>Perhaps my word appears somewhat too bold,</a>
<a id='line_16056'>    Postponing the delight of those fair eyes,</a>
<a id='line_16057'>    Into which gazing my desire has rest;</a>
<a id='line_16058'></a>
<a id='line_16059'>But who bethinks him that the living seals</a>
<a id='line_16060'>    Of every beauty grow in power ascending,</a>
<a id='line_16061'>    And that I there had not turned round to those,</a>
<a id='line_16062'></a>
<a id='line_16063'>Can me excuse, if I myself accuse</a>
<a id='line_16064'>    To excuse myself, and see that I speak truly:</a>
<a id='line_16065'>    For here the holy joy is not disclosed,</a>
<a id='line_16066'></a>

<a id='line_16138'></a>
<a id='line_16139'>And it continued: “Hunger long and grateful,</a>

<a id='line_16149'>    If that be known, ray out the five and six;</a>
<a id='line_16150'></a>
<a id='line_16151'>And therefore who I am thou askest not,</a>

<a id='line_16156'>    Of this existence look into the mirror</a>
<a id='line_16157'>    Wherein, before thou think’st, thy thought thou showest.</a>
<a id='line_16158'></a>
<a id='line_16159'>But that the sacred love, in which I watch</a>
<a id='line_16160'>    With sight perpetual, and which makes me thirst</a>
<a id='line_16161'>    With sweet desire, may better be fulfilled,</a>
<a id='line_16162'></a>
<a id='line_16163'>Now let thy voice secure and frank and glad</a>

<a id='line_16167'>To Beatrice I turned me, and she heard</a>
<a id='line_16168'>    Before I spake, and smiled to me a sign,</a>

<a id='line_16704'>    That, her again beholding, my affection</a>
<a id='line_16705'>    From every other longing was released.</a>
<a id='line_16706'></a>
<a id='line_16707'>While the eternal pleasure, which direct</a>

<a id='line_16710'></a>
<a id='line_16711'>Conquering me with the radiance of a smile,</a>
<a id='line_16712'>    She said to me, “Turn thee about and listen;</a>

<a id='line_16714'></a>
<a id='line_16715'>Even as sometimes here do we behold</a>
<a id='line_16716'>    The affection in the look, if it be such</a>
<a id='line_16717'>    That all the soul is wrapt away by it,</a>
<a id='line_16718'></a>
<a id='line_16719'>So, by the flaming of the effulgence holy</a>
<a id='line_16720'>    To which I turned, I recognized therein</a>
<a id='line_16721'>    The wish of speaking to me somewhat farther.</a>
<a id='line_16722'></a>
<a id='line_16723'>And it began: “In this fifth resting-place</a>

<a id='line_16734'></a>
<a id='line_16735'>I saw athwart the Cross a splendour drawn</a>

<a id='line_16746'></a>
<a id='line_16747'>William thereafterward, and Renouard,</a>
<a id='line_16748'>    And the Duke Godfrey, did attract my sight</a>
<a id='line_16749'>    Along upon that Cross, and Robert Guiscard.</a>
<a id='line_16750'></a>
<a id='line_16751'>Then, moved and mingled with the other lights,</a>

<a id='line_16757'>    Either by words or gesture signified;</a>
<a id='line_16758'></a>
<a id='line_16759'>And so translucent I beheld her eyes,</a>
<a id='line_16760'>    So full of pleasure, that her countenance</a>
<a id='line_16761'>    Surpassed its other and its latest wont.</a>
<a id='line_16762'></a>
<a id='line_16763'>And as, by feeling greater delectation,</a>
<a id='line_16764'>    A man in doing good from day to day</a>
<a id='line_16765'>    Becomes aware his virtue is increasing,</a>
<a id='line_16766'></a>
<a id='line_16767'>So I became aware that my gyration</a>

<a id='line_16769'>    That miracle beholding more adorned.</a>
<a id='line_16770'></a>
<a id='line_16771'>And such as is the change, in little lapse</a>
<a id='line_16772'>    Of time, in a pale woman, when her face</a>
<a id='line_16773'>    Is from the load of bashfulness unladen,</a>
<a id='line_16774'></a>
<a id='line_16775'>Such was it in mine eyes, when I had turned,</a>
<a id='line_16776'>    Caused by the whiteness of the temperate star,</a>
<a id='line_16777'>    The sixth, which to itself had gathered me.</a>
<a id='line_16778'></a>
<a id='line_16779'>Within that Jovial torch did I behold</a>
<a id='line_16780'>    The sparkling of the love which was therein</a>
<a id='line_16781'>    Delineate our language to mine eyes.</a>
<a id='line_16782'></a>
<a id='line_16783'>And even as birds uprisen from the shore,</a>

<a id='line_16785'>    Make squadrons of themselves, now round, now long,</a>
<a id='line_16786'></a>
<a id='line_16787'>So from within those lights the holy creatures</a>

<a id='line_17506'></a>
<a id='line_17507'>As it seemed good to her mine eyes I turned,</a>

<a id='line_17606'></a>
<a id='line_17607'>Thus unto me he said; and then withdrew</a>
<a id='line_17608'>    To his own band, and the band closed together;</a>
<a id='line_17609'>    Then like a whirlwind all was upward rapt.</a>
<a id='line_17610'></a>

<a id='line_17622'></a>
<a id='line_17623'>Thou hadst not thrust thy finger in the fire</a>
<a id='line_17624'>    And drawn it out again, before I saw</a>
<a id='line_17625'>    The sign that follows Taurus, and was in it.</a>
<a id='line_17626'></a>
<a id='line_17627'>O glorious stars, O light impregnated</a>

<a id='line_17642'></a>
<a id='line_17643'>“Thou art so near unto the last salvation,”</a>

<a id='line_17654'></a>
<a id='line_17655'>I with my sight returned through one and all</a>

<a id='line_17662'></a>
<a id='line_17663'>I saw the daughter of Latona shining</a>

<a id='line_17666'></a>
<a id='line_17667'>The aspect of thy son, Hyperion,</a>

<a id='line_18046'></a>
<a id='line_18047'>“O holy father, spirit who beholdest</a>

<a id='line_18118'></a>
<a id='line_18119'>In the same way as, when a dove alights</a>
<a id='line_18120'>    Near his companion, both of them pour forth,</a>
<a id='line_18121'>    Circling about and murmuring, their affection,</a>
<a id='line_18122'></a>
<a id='line_18123'>So one beheld I by the other grand</a>
<a id='line_18124'>    Prince glorified to be with welcome greeted,</a>
<a id='line_18125'>    Lauding the food that there above is eaten.</a>
<a id='line_18126'></a>
<a id='line_18127'>But when their gratulations were complete,</a>
<a id='line_18128'>    Silently ‘coram me’ each one stood still,</a>
<a id='line_18129'>    So incandescent it o’ercame my sight.</a>
<a id='line_18130'></a>
<a id='line_18131'>Smiling thereafterwards, said Beatrice:</a>
<a id='line_18132'>    “Illustrious life, by whom the benefactions</a>
<a id='line_18133'>    Of our Basilica have been described,</a>
<a id='line_18134'></a>
<a id='line_18135'>Make Hope resound within this altitude;</a>
<a id='line_18136'>    Thou knowest as oft thou dost personify it</a>
<a id='line_18137'>    As Jesus to the three gave greater clearness.”—</a>
<a id='line_18138'></a>
<a id='line_18139'>“Lift up thy head, and make thyself assured;</a>
<a id='line_18140'>    For what comes hither from the mortal world</a>
<a id='line_18141'>    Must needs be ripened in our radiance.”</a>
<a id='line_18142'></a>
<a id='line_18143'>This comfort came to me from the second fire;</a>
<a id='line_18144'>    Wherefore mine eyes I lifted to the hills,</a>
<a id='line_18145'>    Which bent them down before with too great weight.</a>
<a id='line_18146'></a>
<a id='line_18147'>“Since, through his grace, our Emperor wills that thou</a>
<a id='line_18148'>    Shouldst find thee face to face, before thy death,</a>
<a id='line_18149'>    In the most secret chamber, with his Counts,</a>
<a id='line_18150'></a>
<a id='line_18151'>So that, the truth beholden of this court,</a>
<a id='line_18152'>    Hope, which below there rightfully enamours,</a>
<a id='line_18153'>    Thereby thou strengthen in thyself and others,</a>
<a id='line_18154'></a>
<a id='line_18155'>Say what it is, and how is flowering with it</a>
<a id='line_18156'>    Thy mind, and say from whence it came to thee.”</a>
<a id='line_18157'>    Thus did the second light again continue.</a>
<a id='line_18158'></a>
<a id='line_18159'>And the Compassionate, who piloted</a>
<a id='line_18160'>    The plumage of my wings in such high flight,</a>
<a id='line_18161'>    Did in reply anticipate me thus:</a>
<a id='line_18162'></a>
<a id='line_18163'>“No child whatever the Church Militant</a>
<a id='line_18164'>    Of greater hope possesses, as is written</a>
<a id='line_18165'>    In that Sun which irradiates all our band;</a>
<a id='line_18166'></a>
<a id='line_18167'>Therefore it is conceded him from Egypt</a>
<a id='line_18168'>    To come into Jerusalem to see,</a>
<a id='line_18169'>    Or ever yet his warfare be completed.</a>
<a id='line_18170'></a>
<a id='line_18171'>The two remaining points, that not for knowledge</a>
<a id='line_18172'>    Have been demanded, but that he report</a>
<a id='line_18173'>    How much this virtue unto thee is pleasing,</a>
<a id='line_18174'></a>
<a id='line_18175'>To him I leave; for hard he will not find them,</a>
<a id='line_18176'>    Nor of self-praise; and let him answer them;</a>
<a id='line_18177'>    And may the grace of God in this assist him!”</a>
<a id='line_18178'></a>
<a id='line_18179'>As a disciple, who his teacher follows,</a>
<a id='line_18180'>    Ready and willing, where he is expert,</a>
<a id='line_18181'>    That his proficiency may be displayed,</a>
<a id='line_18182'></a>
<a id='line_18183'>“Hope,” said I, “is the certain expectation</a>
<a id='line_18184'>    Of future glory, which is the effect</a>
<a id='line_18185'>    Of grace divine and merit precedent.</a>
<a id='line_18186'></a>
<a id='line_18187'>From many stars this light comes unto me;</a>
<a id='line_18188'>    But he instilled it first into my heart</a>
<a id='line_18189'>    Who was chief singer unto the chief captain.</a>
<a id='line_18190'></a>
<a id='line_18191'>‘Sperent in te,’ in the high Theody</a>
<a id='line_18192'>    He sayeth, ‘those who know thy name;’ and who</a>
<a id='line_18193'>    Knoweth it not, if he my faith possess?</a>
<a id='line_18194'></a>
<a id='line_18195'>Thou didst instil me, then, with his instilling</a>
<a id='line_18196'>    In the Epistle, so that I am full,</a>
<a id='line_18197'>    And upon others rain again your rain.”</a>
<a id='line_18198'></a>
<a id='line_18199'>While I was speaking, in the living bosom</a>
<a id='line_18200'>    Of that combustion quivered an effulgence,</a>
<a id='line_18201'>    Sudden and frequent, in the guise of lightning;</a>
<a id='line_18202'></a>
<a id='line_18203'>Then breathed: “The love wherewith I am inflamed</a>
<a id='line_18204'>    Towards the virtue still which followed me</a>
<a id='line_18205'>    Unto the palm and issue of the field,</a>
<a id='line_18206'></a>
<a id='line_18207'>Wills that I breathe to thee that thou delight</a>
<a id='line_18208'>    In her; and grateful to me is thy telling</a>
<a id='line_18209'>    Whatever things Hope promises to thee.”</a>
<a id='line_18210'></a>
<a id='line_18211'>And I: “The ancient Scriptures and the new</a>
<a id='line_18212'>    The mark establish, and this shows it me,</a>
<a id='line_18213'>    Of all the souls whom God hath made his friends.</a>
<a id='line_18214'></a>
<a id='line_18215'>Isaiah saith, that each one garmented</a>
<a id='line_18216'>    In his own land shall be with twofold garments,</a>
<a id='line_18217'>    And his own land is this delightful life.</a>
<a id='line_18218'></a>
<a id='line_18219'>Thy brother, too, far more explicitly,</a>
<a id='line_18220'>    There where he treateth of the robes of white,</a>
<a id='line_18221'>    This revelation manifests to us.”</a>
<a id='line_18222'></a>
<a id='line_18223'>And first, and near the ending of these words,</a>
<a id='line_18224'>    “Sperent in te” from over us was heard,</a>
<a id='line_18225'>    To which responsive answered all the carols.</a>
<a id='line_18226'></a>
<a id='line_18227'>Thereafterward a light among them brightened,</a>
<a id='line_18228'>    So that, if Cancer one such crystal had,</a>
<a id='line_18229'>    Winter would have a month of one sole day.</a>
<a id='line_18230'></a>
<a id='line_18231'>And as uprises, goes, and enters the dance</a>
<a id='line_18232'>    A winsome maiden, only to do honour</a>
<a id='line_18233'>    To the new bride, and not from any failing,</a>
<a id='line_18234'></a>
<a id='line_18235'>Even thus did I behold the brightened splendour</a>
<a id='line_18236'>    Approach the two, who in a wheel revolved</a>
<a id='line_18237'>    As was beseeming to their ardent love.</a>
<a id='line_18238'></a>
<a id='line_18239'>Into the song and music there it entered;</a>
<a id='line_18240'>    And fixed on them my Lady kept her look,</a>
<a id='line_18241'>    Even as a bride silent and motionless.</a>
<a id='line_18242'></a>
<a id='line_18243'>“This is the one who lay upon the breast</a>
<a id='line_18244'>    Of him our Pelican; and this is he</a>
<a id='line_18245'>    To the great office from the cross elected.”</a>
<a id='line_18246'></a>
<a id='line_18247'>My Lady thus; but therefore none the more</a>
<a id='line_18248'>    Did move her sight from its attentive gaze</a>
<a id='line_18249'>    Before or afterward these words of hers.</a>
<a id='line_18250'></a>
<a id='line_18251'>Even as a man who gazes, and endeavours</a>
<a id='line_18252'>    To see the eclipsing of the sun a little,</a>
<a id='line_18253'>    And who, by seeing, sightless doth become,</a>
<a id='line_18254'></a>
<a id='line_18255'>So I became before that latest fire,</a>
<a id='line_18256'>    While it was said, “Why dost thou daze thyself</a>
<a id='line_18257'>    To see a thing which here hath no existence?</a>
<a id='line_18258'></a>
<a id='line_18259'>Earth in the earth my body is, and shall be</a>
<a id='line_18260'>    With all the others there, until our number</a>
<a id='line_18261'>    With the eternal proposition tallies.</a>
<a id='line_18262'></a>
<a id='line_18263'>With the two garments in the blessed cloister</a>
<a id='line_18264'>    Are the two lights alone that have ascended:</a>
<a id='line_18265'>    And this shalt thou take back into your world.”</a>
<a id='line_18266'></a>
<a id='line_18267'>And at this utterance the flaming circle</a>
<a id='line_18268'>    Grew quiet, with the dulcet intermingling</a>
<a id='line_18269'>    Of sound that by the trinal breath was made,</a>
<a id='line_18270'></a>
<a id='line_18271'>As to escape from danger or fatigue</a>
<a id='line_18272'>    The oars that erst were in the water beaten</a>
<a id='line_18273'>    Are all suspended at a whistle’s sound.</a>
<a id='line_18274'></a>
<a id='line_18275'>Ah, how much in my mind was I disturbed,</a>
<a id='line_18276'>    When I turned round to look on Beatrice,</a>

<a id='line_18285'></a>
<a id='line_18286'></a>
<a id='line_18287'>While I was doubting for my vision quenched,</a>
<a id='line_18288'>    Out of the flame refulgent that had quenched it</a>
<a id='line_18289'>    Issued a breathing, that attentive made me,</a>

<a id='line_18318'></a>
<a id='line_18319'>And I: “By philosophic arguments,</a>

<a id='line_18398'></a>
<a id='line_18399'>Even as the bough that downward bends its top</a>

<a id='line_18402'></a>
<a id='line_18403'>Likewise did I, the while that she was speaking,</a>

<a id='line_18810'></a>

<a id='line_19111'>For as the sun the sight that trembles most,</a>
<a id='line_19112'>    Even so the memory of that sweet smile</a>
<a id='line_19113'>    My mind depriveth of its very self.</a>
<a id='line_19114'></a>
<a id='line_19115'>From the first day that I beheld her face</a>
<a id='line_19116'>    In this life, to the moment of this look,</a>
<a id='line_19117'>    The sequence of my song has ne’er been severed;</a>
<a id='line_19118'></a>
<a id='line_19119'>But now perforce this sequence must desist</a>
<a id='line_19120'>    From following her beauty with my verse,</a>
<a id='line_19121'>    As every artist at his uttermost.</a>
<a id='line_19122'></a>
<a id='line_19123'>Such as I leave her to a greater fame</a>
<a id='line_19124'>    Than any of my trumpet, which is bringing</a>
<a id='line_19125'>    Its arduous matter to a final close,</a>
<a id='line_19126'></a>
<a id='line_19127'>With voice and gesture of a perfect leader</a>
<a id='line_19128'>    She recommenced: “We from the greatest body</a>
<a id='line_19129'>    Have issued to the heaven that is pure light;</a>
<a id='line_19130'></a>
<a id='line_19131'>Light intellectual replete with love,</a>
<a id='line_19132'>    Love of true good replete with ecstasy,</a>

<a id='line_19138'></a>
<a id='line_19139'>Even as a sudden lightning that disperses</a>
<a id='line_19140'>    The visual spirits, so that it deprives</a>
<a id='line_19141'>    The eye of impress from the strongest objects,</a>
<a id='line_19142'></a>
<a id='line_19143'>Thus round about me flashed a living light,</a>
<a id='line_19144'>    And left me swathed around with such a veil</a>
<a id='line_19145'>    Of its effulgence, that I nothing saw.</a>
<a id='line_19146'></a>
<a id='line_19147'>“Ever the Love which quieteth this heaven</a>
<a id='line_19148'>    Welcomes into itself with such salute,</a>

<a id='line_19150'></a>
<a id='line_19151'>No sooner had within me these brief words</a>
<a id='line_19152'>    An entrance found, than I perceived myself</a>
<a id='line_19153'>    To be uplifted over my own power,</a>
<a id='line_19154'></a>
<a id='line_19155'>And I with vision new rekindled me,</a>
<a id='line_19156'>    Such that no light whatever is so pure</a>
<a id='line_19157'>    But that mine eyes were fortified against it.</a>
<a id='line_19158'></a>
<a id='line_19159'>And light I saw in fashion of a river</a>
<a id='line_19160'>    Fulvid with its effulgence, ’twixt two banks</a>
<a id='line_19161'>    Depicted with an admirable Spring.</a>
<a id='line_19162'></a>
<a id='line_19163'>Out of this river issued living sparks,</a>
<a id='line_19164'>    And on all sides sank down into the flowers,</a>
<a id='line_19165'>    Like unto rubies that are set in gold;</a>
<a id='line_19166'></a>
<a id='line_19167'>And then, as if inebriate with the odours,</a>
<a id='line_19168'>    They plunged again into the wondrous torrent,</a>
<a id='line_19169'>    And as one entered issued forth another.</a>
<a id='line_19170'></a>
<a id='line_19171'>“The high desire, that now inflames and moves thee</a>
<a id='line_19172'>    To have intelligence of what thou seest,</a>
<a id='line_19173'>    Pleaseth me all the more, the more it swells.</a>
<a id='line_19174'></a>
<a id='line_19175'>But of this water it behoves thee drink</a>
<a id='line_19176'>    Before so great a thirst in thee be slaked.”</a>
<a id='line_19177'>    Thus said to me the sunshine of mine eyes;</a>
<a id='line_19178'></a>
<a id='line_19179'>And added: “The river and the topazes</a>
<a id='line_19180'>    Going in and out, and the laughing of the herbage,</a>
<a id='line_19181'>    Are of their truth foreshadowing prefaces;</a>
<a id='line_19182'></a>
<a id='line_19183'>Not that these things are difficult in themselves,</a>
<a id='line_19184'>    But the deficiency is on thy side,</a>
<a id='line_19185'>    For yet thou hast not vision so exalted.”</a>
<a id='line_19186'></a>
<a id='line_19187'>There is no babe that leaps so suddenly</a>
<a id='line_19188'>    With face towards the milk, if he awake</a>
<a id='line_19189'>    Much later than his usual custom is,</a>
<a id='line_19190'></a>
<a id='line_19191'>As I did, that I might make better mirrors</a>
<a id='line_19192'>    Still of mine eyes, down stooping to the wave</a>
<a id='line_19193'>    Which flows that we therein be better made.</a>
<a id='line_19194'></a>
<a id='line_19195'>And even as the penthouse of mine eyelids</a>
<a id='line_19196'>    Drank of it, it forthwith appeared to me</a>
<a id='line_19197'>    Out of its length to be transformed to round.</a>
<a id='line_19198'></a>
<a id='line_19199'>Then as a folk who have been under masks</a>
<a id='line_19200'>    Seem other than before, if they divest</a>
<a id='line_19201'>    The semblance not their own they disappeared in,</a>
<a id='line_19202'></a>
<a id='line_19203'>Thus into greater pomp were changed for me</a>
<a id='line_19204'>    The flowerets and the sparks, so that I saw</a>
<a id='line_19205'>    Both of the Courts of Heaven made manifest.</a>
<a id='line_19206'></a>
<a id='line_19207'>O splendour of God! by means of which I saw</a>
<a id='line_19208'>    The lofty triumph of the realm veracious,</a>
<a id='line_19209'>    Give me the power to say how it I saw!</a>
<a id='line_19210'></a>
<a id='line_19211'>There is a light above, which visible</a>
<a id='line_19212'>    Makes the Creator unto every creature,</a>
<a id='line_19213'>    Who only in beholding Him has peace,</a>
<a id='line_19214'></a>

<a id='line_19216'>    To such extent, that its circumference</a>
<a id='line_19217'>    Would be too large a girdle for the sun.</a>
<a id='line_19218'></a>
<a id='line_19219'>The semblance of it is all made of rays</a>
<a id='line_19220'>    Reflected from the top of Primal Motion,</a>
<a id='line_19221'>    Which takes therefrom vitality and power.</a>
<a id='line_19222'></a>

<a id='line_19224'>    Mirrors itself, as if to see its beauty</a>
<a id='line_19225'>    When affluent most in verdure and in flowers,</a>
<a id='line_19226'></a>
<a id='line_19227'>So, ranged aloft all round about the light,</a>

<a id='line_19234'></a>
<a id='line_19235'>My vision in the vastness and the height</a>
<a id='line_19236'>    Lost not itself, but comprehended all</a>

<a id='line_19241'>    The natural law in naught is relevant.</a>
<a id='line_19242'></a>
<a id='line_19243'>Into the yellow of the Rose Eternal</a>
<a id='line_19244'>    That spreads, and multiplies, and breathes an odour</a>
<a id='line_19245'>    Of praise unto the ever-vernal Sun,</a>

<a id='line_19346'></a>
<a id='line_19347'>Faces I saw of charity persuasive,</a>

<a id='line_19374'></a>
<a id='line_19375'>Without reply I lifted up mine eyes,</a>
<a id='line_19376'>    And saw her, as she made herself a crown</a>
<a id='line_19377'>    Reflecting from herself the eternal rays.</a>
<a id='line_19378'></a>
<a id='line_19379'>Not from that region which the highest thunders</a>

<a id='line_19386'></a>
<a id='line_19387'>“O Lady, thou in whom my hope is strong,</a>

<a id='line_19402'></a>
<a id='line_19403'>Thus I implored; and she, so far away,</a>
<a id='line_19404'>    Smiled, as it seemed, and looked once more at me;</a>
<a id='line_19405'>    Then unto the eternal fountain turned.</a>
<a id='line_19406'></a>
<a id='line_19407'>And said the Old Man holy: “That thou mayst</a>

<a id='line_19418'></a>
<a id='line_19419'>As he who peradventure from Croatia</a>
<a id='line_19420'>    Cometh to gaze at our Veronica,</a>

<a id='line_19426'></a>

<a id='line_19438'></a>

<a id='line_19441'>    Surpasses that wherein the sun goes down,</a>
<a id='line_19442'></a>
<a id='line_19443'>Thus, as if going with mine eyes from vale</a>
<a id='line_19444'>    To mount, I saw a part in the remoteness</a>
<a id='line_19445'>    Surpass in splendour all the other front.</a>
<a id='line_19446'></a>
<a id='line_19447'>And even as there where we await the pole</a>

<a id='line_19452'>    Gleamed brightest in the centre, and each side</a>
<a id='line_19453'>    In equal measure did the flame abate.</a>
<a id='line_19454'></a>
<a id='line_19455'>And at that centre, with their wings expanded,</a>
<a id='line_19456'>    More than a thousand jubilant Angels saw I,</a>
<a id='line_19457'>    Each differing in effulgence and in kind.</a>
<a id='line_19458'></a>
<a id='line_19459'>I saw there at their sports and at their songs</a>
<a id='line_19460'>    A beauty smiling, which the gladness was</a>
<a id='line_19461'>    Within the eyes of all the other saints;</a>
<a id='line_19462'></a>
<a id='line_19463'>And if I had in speaking as much wealth</a>

<a id='line_19466'></a>
<a id='line_19467'>Bernard, as soon as he beheld mine eyes</a>

<a id='line_19576'>    Stationed are they in different gradations,</a>
<a id='line_19577'>    Differing only in their first acuteness.</a>
<a id='line_19578'></a>
<a id='line_19579'>’Tis true that in the early centuries,</a>
<a id='line_19580'>    With innocence, to work out their salvation</a>
<a id='line_19581'>    Sufficient was the faith of parents only.</a>
<a id='line_19582'></a>
<a id='line_19583'>After the earlier ages were completed,</a>
<a id='line_19584'>    Behoved it that the males by circumcision</a>
<a id='line_19585'>    Unto their innocent wings should virtue add;</a>
<a id='line_19586'></a>
<a id='line_19587'>But after that the time of grace had come</a>
<a id='line_19588'>    Without the baptism absolute of Christ,</a>
<a id='line_19589'>    Such innocence below there was retained.</a>
<a id='line_19590'></a>
<a id='line_19591'>Look now into the face that unto Christ</a>
<a id='line_19592'>    Hath most resemblance; for its brightness only</a>
<a id='line_19593'>    Is able to prepare thee to see Christ.”</a>
<a id='line_19594'></a>
<a id='line_19595'>On her did I behold so great a gladness</a>
<a id='line_19596'>    Rain down, borne onward in the holy minds</a>
<a id='line_19597'>    Created through that altitude to fly,</a>
<a id='line_19598'></a>
<a id='line_19599'>That whatsoever I had seen before</a>
<a id='line_19600'>    Did not suspend me in such admiration,</a>
<a id='line_19601'>    Nor show me such similitude of God.</a>
<a id='line_19602'></a>
<a id='line_19603'>And the same Love that first descended there,</a>
<a id='line_19604'>    “Ave Maria, gratia plena,” singing,</a>
<a id='line_19605'>    In front of her his wings expanded wide.</a>
<a id='line_19606'></a>
<a id='line_19607'>Unto the canticle divine responded</a>
<a id='line_19608'>    From every part the court beatified,</a>
<a id='line_19609'>    So that each sight became serener for it.</a>
<a id='line_19610'></a>
<a id='line_19611'>“O holy father, who for me endurest</a>
<a id='line_19612'>    To be below here, leaving the sweet place</a>
<a id='line_19613'>    In which thou sittest by eternal lot,</a>
<a id='line_19614'></a>
<a id='line_19615'>Who is the Angel that with so much joy</a>

<a id='line_19617'>    Enamoured so that he seems made of fire?”</a>
<a id='line_19618'></a>
<a id='line_19619'>Thus I again recourse had to the teaching</a>
<a id='line_19620'>    Of that one who delighted him in Mary</a>
<a id='line_19621'>    As doth the star of morning in the sun.</a>
<a id='line_19622'></a>
<a id='line_19623'>And he to me: “Such gallantry and grace</a>

<a id='line_19625'>    All is in him; and thus we fain would have it;</a>
<a id='line_19626'></a>
<a id='line_19627'>Because he is the one who bore the palm</a>
<a id='line_19628'>    Down unto Mary, when the Son of God</a>

<a id='line_19631'>But now come onward with thine eyes, as I</a>

<a id='line_19634'></a>
<a id='line_19635'>Those two that sit above there most enrapture</a>

<a id='line_19641'>    The human species so much bitter tastes.</a>
<a id='line_19642'></a>
<a id='line_19643'>Upon the right thou seest that ancient father</a>
<a id='line_19644'>    Of Holy Church, into whose keeping Christ</a>
<a id='line_19645'>    The keys committed of this lovely flower.</a>
<a id='line_19646'></a>

<a id='line_19650'></a>
<a id='line_19651'>Beside him sits, and by the other rests</a>
<a id='line_19652'>    That leader under whom on manna lived</a>
<a id='line_19653'>    The people ingrate, fickle, and stiff-necked.</a>
<a id='line_19654'></a>
<a id='line_19655'>Opposite Peter seest thou Anna seated,</a>
<a id='line_19656'>    So well content to look upon her daughter,</a>
<a id='line_19657'>    Her eyes she moves not while she sings Hosanna.</a>
<a id='line_19658'></a>
<a id='line_19659'>And opposite the eldest household father</a>

<a id='line_19775'>O Light Supreme, that dost so far uplift thee</a>
<a id='line_19776'>    From the conceits of mortals, to my mind</a>
<a id='line_19777'>    Of what thou didst appear re-lend a little,</a>
<a id='line_19778'></a>
<a id='line_19779'>And make my tongue of so great puissance,</a>
<a id='line_19780'>    That but a single sparkle of thy glory</a>
<a id='line_19781'>    It may bequeath unto the future people;</a>
<a id='line_19782'></a>
<a id='line_19783'>For by returning to my memory somewhat,</a>
<a id='line_19784'>    And by a little sounding in these verses,</a>
<a id='line_19785'>    More of thy victory shall be conceived!</a>
<a id='line_19786'></a>
<a id='line_19787'>I think the keenness of the living ray</a>
<a id='line_19788'>    Which I endured would have bewildered me,</a>
<a id='line_19789'>    If but mine eyes had been averted from it;</a>
<a id='line_19790'></a>
<a id='line_19791'>And I remember that I was more bold</a>
<a id='line_19792'>    On this account to bear, so that I joined</a>
<a id='line_19793'>    My aspect with the Glory Infinite.</a>
<a id='line_19794'></a>
<a id='line_19795'>O grace abundant, by which I presumed</a>
<a id='line_19796'>    To fix my sight upon the Light Eternal,</a>
<a id='line_19797'>    So that the seeing I consumed therein!</a>
<a id='line_19798'></a>
<a id='line_19799'>I saw that in its depth far down is lying</a>
<a id='line_19800'>    Bound up with love together in one volume,</a>
<a id='line_19801'>    What through the universe in leaves is scattered;</a>
<a id='line_19802'></a>
<a id='line_19803'>Substance, and accident, and their operations,</a>
<a id='line_19804'>    All interfused together in such wise</a>
<a id='line_19805'>    That what I speak of is one simple light.</a>
<a id='line_19806'></a>
<a id='line_19807'>The universal fashion of this knot</a>
<a id='line_19808'>    Methinks I saw, since more abundantly</a>
<a id='line_19809'>    In saying this I feel that I rejoice.</a>
<a id='line_19810'></a>
<a id='line_19811'>One moment is more lethargy to me,</a>
<a id='line_19812'>    Than five and twenty centuries to the emprise</a>
<a id='line_19813'>    That startled Neptune with the shade of Argo!</a>
<a id='line_19814'></a>
<a id='line_19815'>My mind in this wise wholly in suspense,</a>
<a id='line_19816'>    Steadfast, immovable, attentive gazed,</a>
<a id='line_19817'>    And evermore with gazing grew enkindled.</a>
<a id='line_19818'></a>
<a id='line_19819'>In presence of that light one such becomes,</a>
<a id='line_19820'>    That to withdraw therefrom for other prospect</a>
<a id='line_19821'>    It is impossible he e’er consent;</a>
<a id='line_19822'></a>
<a id='line_19823'>Because the good, which object is of will,</a>
<a id='line_19824'>    Is gathered all in this, and out of it</a>
<a id='line_19825'>    That is defective which is perfect there.</a>
<a id='line_19826'></a>
<a id='line_19827'>Shorter henceforward will my language fall</a>
<a id='line_19828'>    Of what I yet remember, than an infant’s</a>
<a id='line_19829'>    Who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast.</a>
<a id='line_19830'></a>
<a id='line_19831'>Not because more than one unmingled semblance</a>
<a id='line_19832'>    Was in the living light on which I looked,</a>
<a id='line_19833'>    For it is always what it was before;</a>
<a id='line_19834'></a>
<a id='line_19835'>But through the sight, that fortified itself</a>
<a id='line_19836'>    In me by looking, one appearance only</a>
<a id='line_19837'>    To me was ever changing as I changed.</a>
<a id='line_19838'></a>
<a id='line_19839'>Within the deep and luminous subsistence</a>
<a id='line_19840'>    Of the High Light appeared to me three circles,</a>
<a id='line_19841'>    Of threefold colour and of one dimension,</a>
<a id='line_19842'></a>
<a id='line_19843'>And by the second seemed the first reflected</a>
<a id='line_19844'>    As Iris is by Iris, and the third</a>
<a id='line_19845'>    Seemed fire that equally from both is breathed.</a>
<a id='line_19846'></a>
<a id='line_19847'>O how all speech is feeble and falls short</a>
<a id='line_19848'>    Of my conceit, and this to what I saw</a>
<a id='line_19849'>    Is such, ’tis not enough to call it little!</a>
<a id='line_19850'></a>
<a id='line_19851'>O Light Eterne, sole in thyself that dwellest,</a>
<a id='line_19852'>    Sole knowest thyself, and, known unto thyself</a>
<a id='line_19853'>    And knowing, lovest and smilest on thyself!</a>
<a id='line_19854'></a>
<a id='line_19855'>That circulation, which being thus conceived</a>
<a id='line_19856'>    Appeared in thee as a reflected light,</a>
<a id='line_19857'>    When somewhat contemplated by mine eyes,</a>
<a id='line_19858'></a>
<a id='line_19859'>Within itself, of its own very colour</a>
<a id='line_19860'>    Seemed to me painted with our effigy,</a>
<a id='line_19861'>    Wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein.</a>
<a id='line_19862'></a>
<a id='line_19863'>As the geometrician, who endeavours</a>
<a id='line_19864'>    To square the circle, and discovers not,</a>
<a id='line_19865'>    By taking thought, the principle he wants,</a>
<a id='line_19866'></a>
<a id='line_19867'>Even such was I at that new apparition;</a>
<a id='line_19868'>    I wished to see how the image to the circle</a>
<a id='line_19869'>    Conformed itself, and how it there finds place;</a>
<a id='line_19870'></a>
<a id='line_19871'>But my own wings were not enough for this,</a>
<a id='line_19872'>    Had it not been that then my mind there smote</a>
<a id='line_19873'>    A flash of lightning, wherein came its wish.</a>
<a id='line_19874'></a>
<a id='line_19875'>Here vigour failed the lofty fantasy:</a>
<a id='line_19876'>    But now was turning my desire and will,</a>
<a id='line_19877'>    Even as a wheel that equally is moved,</a>
<a id='line_19878'></a>
<a id='line_19879'>The Love which moves the sun and the other stars.</a>

<a id='line_19893'>    A laborer, pausing in the dust and heat,</a>
<a id='line_19894'>    Lay down his burden, and with reverent feet</a>
<a id='line_19895'>    Enter, and cross himself, and on the floor</a>

<a id='line_19901'>    And leave my burden at this minster gate,</a>
<a id='line_19902'>    Kneeling in prayer, and not ashamed to pray,</a>
<a id='line_19903'>The tumult of the time disconsolate</a>
<a id='line_19904'>    To inarticulate murmurs dies away,</a>
<a id='line_19905'>    While the eternal ages watch and wait.</a>

<a id='line_19910'>How strange the sculptures that adorn these towers!</a>
<a id='line_19911'>    This crowd of statues, in whose folded sleeves</a>
<a id='line_19912'>    Birds build their nests; while canopied with leaves</a>
<a id='line_19913'>    Parvis and portal bloom like trellised bowers,</a>
<a id='line_19914'>And the vast minster seems a cross of flowers!</a>
<a id='line_19915'>    But fiends and dragons on the gargoyled eaves</a>
<a id='line_19916'>    Watch the dead Christ between the living thieves,</a>
<a id='line_19917'>    And, underneath, the traitor Judas lowers!</a>
<a id='line_19918'>Ah! from what agonies of heart and brain,</a>
<a id='line_19919'>    What exultations trampling on despair,</a>
<a id='line_19920'>    What tenderness, what tears, what hate of wrong,</a>
<a id='line_19921'>What passionate outcry of a soul in pain,</a>
<a id='line_19922'>    Uprose this poem of the earth and air,</a>
<a id='line_19923'>    This mediaeval miracle of song!</a>

<a id='line_19930'>    And strive to make my steps keep pace with thine.</a>
<a id='line_19931'>    The air is filled with some unknown perfume;</a>
<a id='line_19932'>The congregation of the dead make room</a>
<a id='line_19933'>    For thee to pass; the votive tapers shine;</a>
<a id='line_19934'>    Like rooks that haunt Ravenna’s groves of pine,</a>
<a id='line_19935'>    The hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb.</a>
<a id='line_19936'>From the confessionals I hear arise</a>
<a id='line_19937'>    Rehearsals of forgotten tragedies,</a>
<a id='line_19938'>    And lamentations from the crypts below</a>
<a id='line_19939'>And then a voice celestial that begins</a>

<a id='line_19949'>    From which thy song in all its splendors came;</a>
<a id='line_19950'>And while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name,</a>
<a id='line_19951'>    The ice about thy heart melts as the snow</a>
<a id='line_19952'>    On mountain heights, and in swift overflow</a>
<a id='line_19953'>    Comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame.</a>
<a id='line_19954'>Thou makest full confession; and a gleam</a>
<a id='line_19955'>    As of the dawn on some dark forest cast,</a>
<a id='line_19956'>    Seems on thy lifted forehead to increase;</a>
<a id='line_19957'>Lethe and Eunoe—the remembered dream</a>
