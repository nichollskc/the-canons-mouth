<a id='line_8'>      In the connection of the church and state, I have considered the</a>
<a id='line_9'>      former as subservient only, and relative, to the latter; a</a>
<a id='line_10'>      salutary maxim, if in fact, as well as in narrative, it had ever</a>
<a id='line_11'>      been held sacred. The Oriental philosophy of the Gnostics, the</a>
<a id='line_12'>      dark abyss of predestination and grace, and the strange</a>
<a id='line_13'>      transformation of the Eucharist from the sign to the substance of</a>
<a id='line_14'>      Christ’s body, 1 I have purposely abandoned to the curiosity of</a>
<a id='line_15'>      speculative divines. But I have reviewed, with diligence and</a>
<a id='line_16'>      pleasure, the objects of ecclesiastical history, by which the</a>
<a id='line_17'>      decline and fall of the Roman empire were materially affected,</a>
<a id='line_18'>      the propagation of Christianity, the constitution of the Catholic</a>
<a id='line_19'>      church, the ruin of Paganism, and the sects that arose from the</a>
<a id='line_20'>      mysterious controversies concerning the Trinity and incarnation.</a>
<a id='line_21'>      At the head of this class, we may justly rank the worship of</a>
<a id='line_22'>      images, so fiercely disputed in the eighth and ninth centuries;</a>
<a id='line_23'>      since a question of popular superstition produced the revolt of</a>
<a id='line_24'>      Italy, the temporal power of the popes, and the restoration of</a>
<a id='line_25'>      the Roman empire in the West.</a>
<a id='line_26'></a>
<a id='line_27'>      1 (return) [ The learned Selden has given the history of</a>
<a id='line_28'>      transubstantiation in a comprehensive and pithy sentence: “This</a>
<a id='line_29'>      opinion is only rhetoric turned into logic,” (his Works, vol.</a>
<a id='line_30'>      iii. p. 2037, in his Table-Talk.)]</a>
<a id='line_31'></a>
<a id='line_32'>      The primitive Christians were possessed with an unconquerable</a>
<a id='line_33'>      repugnance to the use and abuse of images; and this aversion may</a>
<a id='line_34'>      be ascribed to their descent from the Jews, and their enmity to</a>
<a id='line_35'>      the Greeks. The Mosaic law had severely proscribed all</a>
<a id='line_36'>      representations of the Deity; and that precept was firmly</a>
<a id='line_37'>      established in the principles and practice of the chosen people.</a>
<a id='line_38'>      The wit of the Christian apologists was pointed against the</a>
<a id='line_39'>      foolish idolaters, who bowed before the workmanship of their own</a>
<a id='line_40'>      hands; the images of brass and marble, which, had they been</a>
<a id='line_41'>      endowed with sense and motion, should have started rather from</a>
<a id='line_42'>      the pedestal to adore the creative powers of the artist. 2</a>
<a id='line_43'>      Perhaps some recent and imperfect converts of the Gnostic tribe</a>
<a id='line_44'>      might crown the statues of Christ and St. Paul with the profane</a>
<a id='line_45'>      honors which they paid to those of Aristotle and Pythagoras; 3</a>
<a id='line_46'>      but the public religion of the Catholics was uniformly simple and</a>
<a id='line_47'>      spiritual; and the first notice of the use of pictures is in the</a>
<a id='line_48'>      censure of the council of Illiberis, three hundred years after</a>
<a id='line_49'>      the Christian aera. Under the successors of Constantine, in the</a>
<a id='line_50'>      peace and luxury of the triumphant church, the more prudent</a>
<a id='line_51'>      bishops condescended to indulge a visible superstition, for the</a>
<a id='line_52'>      benefit of the multitude; and, after the ruin of Paganism, they</a>
<a id='line_53'>      were no longer restrained by the apprehension of an odious</a>
<a id='line_54'>      parallel. The first introduction of a symbolic worship was in the</a>
<a id='line_55'>      veneration of the cross, and of relics. The saints and martyrs,</a>
<a id='line_56'>      whose intercession was implored, were seated on the right hand of</a>
<a id='line_57'>      God; but the gracious and often supernatural favors, which, in</a>
<a id='line_58'>      the popular belief, were showered round their tomb, conveyed an</a>
<a id='line_59'>      unquestionable sanction of the devout pilgrims, who visited, and</a>
<a id='line_60'>      touched, and kissed these lifeless remains, the memorials of</a>
<a id='line_61'>      their merits and sufferings. 4 But a memorial, more interesting</a>
<a id='line_62'>      than the skull or the sandals of a departed worthy, is the</a>
<a id='line_63'>      faithful copy of his person and features, delineated by the arts</a>
<a id='line_64'>      of painting or sculpture. In every age, such copies, so congenial</a>
<a id='line_65'>      to human feelings, have been cherished by the zeal of private</a>
<a id='line_66'>      friendship, or public esteem: the images of the Roman emperors</a>
<a id='line_67'>      were adored with civil, and almost religious, honors; a reverence</a>
<a id='line_68'>      less ostentatious, but more sincere, was applied to the statues</a>
<a id='line_69'>      of sages and patriots; and these profane virtues, these splendid</a>
<a id='line_70'>      sins, disappeared in the presence of the holy men, who had died</a>
<a id='line_71'>      for their celestial and everlasting country. At first, the</a>
<a id='line_72'>      experiment was made with caution and scruple; and the venerable</a>
<a id='line_73'>      pictures were discreetly allowed to instruct the ignorant, to</a>
<a id='line_74'>      awaken the cold, and to gratify the prejudices of the heathen</a>
<a id='line_75'>      proselytes. By a slow though inevitable progression, the honors</a>
<a id='line_76'>      of the original were transferred to the copy: the devout</a>
<a id='line_77'>      Christian prayed before the image of a saint; and the Pagan rites</a>
<a id='line_78'>      of genuflection, luminaries, and incense, again stole into the</a>
<a id='line_79'>      Catholic church. The scruples of reason, or piety, were silenced</a>
<a id='line_80'>      by the strong evidence of visions and miracles; and the pictures</a>
<a id='line_81'>      which speak, and move, and bleed, must be endowed with a divine</a>
<a id='line_82'>      energy, and may be considered as the proper objects of religious</a>
<a id='line_83'>      adoration. The most audacious pencil might tremble in the rash</a>
<a id='line_84'>      attempt of defining, by forms and colors, the infinite Spirit,</a>
<a id='line_85'>      the eternal Father, who pervades and sustains the universe. 5 But</a>
<a id='line_86'>      the superstitious mind was more easily reconciled to paint and to</a>
<a id='line_87'>      worship the angels, and, above all, the Son of God, under the</a>
<a id='line_88'>      human shape, which, on earth, they have condescended to assume.</a>
<a id='line_89'>      The second person of the Trinity had been clothed with a real and</a>
<a id='line_90'>      mortal body; but that body had ascended into heaven: and, had not</a>
<a id='line_91'>      some similitude been presented to the eyes of his disciples, the</a>
<a id='line_92'>      spiritual worship of Christ might have been obliterated by the</a>
<a id='line_93'>      visible relics and representations of the saints. A similar</a>
<a id='line_94'>      indulgence was requisite and propitious for the Virgin Mary: the</a>
<a id='line_95'>      place of her burial was unknown; and the assumption of her soul</a>
<a id='line_96'>      and body into heaven was adopted by the credulity of the Greeks</a>
<a id='line_97'>      and Latins. The use, and even the worship, of images was firmly</a>
<a id='line_98'>      established before the end of the sixth century: they were fondly</a>
<a id='line_99'>      cherished by the warm imagination of the Greeks and Asiatics: the</a>
<a id='line_100'>      Pantheon and Vatican were adorned with the emblems of a new</a>
<a id='line_101'>      superstition; but this semblance of idolatry was more coldly</a>
<a id='line_102'>      entertained by the rude Barbarians and the Arian clergy of the</a>
<a id='line_103'>      West. The bolder forms of sculpture, in brass or marble, which</a>
<a id='line_104'>      peopled the temples of antiquity, were offensive to the fancy or</a>
<a id='line_105'>      conscience of the Christian Greeks: and a smooth surface of</a>
<a id='line_106'>      colors has ever been esteemed a more decent and harmless mode of</a>
<a id='line_107'>      imitation. 6</a>

<a id='line_138'></a>
<a id='line_139'>      The merit and effect of a copy depends on its resemblance with</a>
<a id='line_140'>      the original; but the primitive Christians were ignorant of the</a>
<a id='line_141'>      genuine features of the Son of God, his mother, and his apostles:</a>
<a id='line_142'>      the statue of Christ at Paneas in Palestine 7 was more probably</a>
<a id='line_143'>      that of some temporal savior; the Gnostics and their profane</a>
<a id='line_144'>      monuments were reprobated; and the fancy of the Christian artists</a>
<a id='line_145'>      could only be guided by the clandestine imitation of some heathen</a>
<a id='line_146'>      model. In this distress, a bold and dexterous invention assured</a>
<a id='line_147'>      at once the likeness of the image and the innocence of the</a>
<a id='line_148'>      worship. A new super structure of fable was raised on the popular</a>
<a id='line_149'>      basis of a Syrian legend, on the correspondence of Christ and</a>
<a id='line_150'>      Abgarus, so famous in the days of Eusebius, so reluctantly</a>
<a id='line_151'>      deserted by our modern advocates. The bishop of Caesarea 8</a>
<a id='line_152'>      records the epistle, 9 but he most strangely forgets the picture</a>
<a id='line_153'>      of Christ; 10 the perfect impression of his face on a linen, with</a>
<a id='line_154'>      which he gratified the faith of the royal stranger who had</a>
<a id='line_155'>      invoked his healing power, and offered the strong city of Edessa</a>
<a id='line_156'>      to protect him against the malice of the Jews. The ignorance of</a>
<a id='line_157'>      the primitive church is explained by the long imprisonment of the</a>
<a id='line_158'>      image in a niche of the wall, from whence, after an oblivion of</a>
<a id='line_159'>      five hundred years, it was released by some prudent bishop, and</a>
<a id='line_160'>      seasonably presented to the devotion of the times. Its first and</a>
<a id='line_161'>      most glorious exploit was the deliverance of the city from the</a>
<a id='line_162'>      arms of Chosroes Nushirvan; and it was soon revered as a pledge</a>
<a id='line_163'>      of the divine promise, that Edessa should never be taken by a</a>
<a id='line_164'>      foreign enemy. It is true, indeed, that the text of Procopius</a>
<a id='line_165'>      ascribes the double deliverance of Edessa to the wealth and valor</a>
<a id='line_166'>      of her citizens, who purchased the absence and repelled the</a>
<a id='line_167'>      assaults of the Persian monarch. He was ignorant, the profane</a>
<a id='line_168'>      historian, of the testimony which he is compelled to deliver in</a>
<a id='line_169'>      the ecclesiastical page of Evagrius, that the Palladium was</a>
<a id='line_170'>      exposed on the rampart, and that the water which had been</a>
<a id='line_171'>      sprinkled on the holy face, instead of quenching, added new fuel</a>
<a id='line_172'>      to the flames of the besieged. After this important service, the</a>
<a id='line_173'>      image of Edessa was preserved with respect and gratitude; and if</a>
<a id='line_174'>      the Armenians rejected the legend, the more credulous Greeks</a>
<a id='line_175'>      adored the similitude, which was not the work of any mortal</a>
<a id='line_176'>      pencil, but the immediate creation of the divine original. The</a>
<a id='line_177'>      style and sentiments of a Byzantine hymn will declare how far</a>
<a id='line_178'>      their worship was removed from the grossest idolatry. “How can we</a>
<a id='line_179'>      with mortal eyes contemplate this image, whose celestial splendor</a>
<a id='line_180'>      the host of heaven presumes not to behold? He who dwells in</a>
<a id='line_181'>      heaven, condescends this day to visit us by his venerable image;</a>
<a id='line_182'>      He who is seated on the cherubim, visits us this day by a</a>
<a id='line_183'>      picture, which the Father has delineated with his immaculate</a>
<a id='line_184'>      hand, which he has formed in an ineffable manner, and which we</a>
<a id='line_185'>      sanctify by adoring it with fear and love.” Before the end of the</a>
<a id='line_186'>      sixth century, these images, made without hands, (in Greek it is</a>
<a id='line_187'>      a single word, 11 were propagated in the camps and cities of the</a>
<a id='line_188'>      Eastern empire: 12 they were the objects of worship, and the</a>
<a id='line_189'>      instruments of miracles; and in the hour of danger or tumult,</a>
<a id='line_190'>      their venerable presence could revive the hope, rekindle the</a>
<a id='line_191'>      courage, or repress the fury, of the Roman legions. Of these</a>
<a id='line_192'>      pictures, the far greater part, the transcripts of a human</a>
<a id='line_193'>      pencil, could only pretend to a secondary likeness and improper</a>
<a id='line_194'>      title: but there were some of higher descent, who derived their</a>
<a id='line_195'>      resemblance from an immediate contact with the original, endowed,</a>
<a id='line_196'>      for that purpose, with a miraculous and prolific virtue. The most</a>
<a id='line_197'>      ambitious aspired from a filial to a fraternal relation with the</a>
<a id='line_198'>      image of Edessa; and such is the veronica of Rome, or Spain, or</a>
<a id='line_199'>      Jerusalem, which Christ in his agony and bloody sweat applied to</a>
<a id='line_200'>      his face, and delivered to a holy matron. The fruitful precedent</a>
<a id='line_201'>      was speedily transferred to the Virgin Mary, and the saints and</a>
<a id='line_202'>      martyrs. In the church of Diospolis, in Palestine, the features</a>
<a id='line_203'>      of the Mother of God 13 were deeply inscribed in a marble column;</a>
<a id='line_204'>      the East and West have been decorated by the pencil of St. Luke;</a>
<a id='line_205'>      and the Evangelist, who was perhaps a physician, has been forced</a>
<a id='line_206'>      to exercise the occupation of a painter, so profane and odious in</a>
<a id='line_207'>      the eyes of the primitive Christians. The Olympian Jove, created</a>
<a id='line_208'>      by the muse of Homer and the chisel of Phidias, might inspire a</a>
<a id='line_209'>      philosophic mind with momentary devotion; but these Catholic</a>
<a id='line_210'>      images were faintly and flatly delineated by monkish artists in</a>
<a id='line_211'>      the last degeneracy of taste and genius. 14</a>

<a id='line_280'>      The worship of images had stolen into the church by insensible</a>

<a id='line_283'>      beginning of the eighth century, in the full magnitude of the</a>
<a id='line_284'>      abuse, the more timorous Greeks were awakened by an apprehension,</a>

<a id='line_288'>      Mahometans, 15 who derived from the Law and the Koran an immortal</a>
<a id='line_289'>      hatred to graven images and all relative worship. The servitude</a>
<a id='line_290'>      of the Jews might curb their zeal, and depreciate their</a>
<a id='line_291'>      authority; but the triumphant Mussulmans, who reigned at</a>
<a id='line_292'>      Damascus, and threatened Constantinople, cast into the scale of</a>
<a id='line_293'>      reproach the accumulated weight of truth and victory. The cities</a>
<a id='line_294'>      of Syria, Palestine, and Egypt had been fortified with the images</a>
<a id='line_295'>      of Christ, his mother, and his saints; and each city presumed on</a>
<a id='line_296'>      the hope or promise of miraculous defence. In a rapid conquest of</a>
<a id='line_297'>      ten years, the Arabs subdued those cities and these images; and,</a>
<a id='line_298'>      in their opinion, the Lord of Hosts pronounced a decisive</a>
<a id='line_299'>      judgment between the adoration and contempt of these mute and</a>
<a id='line_300'>      inanimate idols. 1511 For a while Edessa had braved the Persian</a>
<a id='line_301'>      assaults; but the chosen city, the spouse of Christ, was involved</a>
<a id='line_302'>      in the common ruin; and his divine resemblance became the slave</a>
<a id='line_303'>      and trophy of the infidels. After a servitude of three hundred</a>
<a id='line_304'>      years, the Palladium was yielded to the devotion of</a>
<a id='line_305'>      Constantinople, for a ransom of twelve thousand pounds of silver,</a>
<a id='line_306'>      the redemption of two hundred Mussulmans, and a perpetual truce</a>
<a id='line_307'>      for the territory of Edessa. 16 In this season of distress and</a>
<a id='line_308'>      dismay, the eloquence of the monks was exercised in the defence</a>
<a id='line_309'>      of images; and they attempted to prove, that the sin and schism</a>
<a id='line_310'>      of the greatest part of the Orientals had forfeited the favor,</a>
<a id='line_311'>      and annihilated the virtue, of these precious symbols. But they</a>
<a id='line_312'>      were now opposed by the murmurs of many simple or rational</a>
<a id='line_313'>      Christians, who appealed to the evidence of texts, of facts, and</a>
<a id='line_314'>      of the primitive times, and secretly desired the reformation of</a>
<a id='line_315'>      the church. As the worship of images had never been established</a>
<a id='line_316'>      by any general or positive law, its progress in the Eastern</a>

<a id='line_361'>      Third, 18 who, from the mountains of Isauria, ascended the throne</a>

<a id='line_363'>      his education, his reason, perhaps his intercourse with the Jews</a>
<a id='line_364'>      and Arabs, had inspired the martial peasant with a hatred of</a>

<a id='line_368'>      danger, Leo submitted to the meanness of hypocrisy, bowed before</a>
<a id='line_369'>      the idols which he despised, and satisfied the Roman pontiff with</a>
<a id='line_370'>      the annual professions of his orthodoxy and zeal. In the</a>
<a id='line_371'>      reformation of religion, his first steps were moderate and</a>
<a id='line_372'>      cautious: he assembled a great council of senators and bishops,</a>
<a id='line_373'>      and enacted, with their consent, that all the images should be</a>
<a id='line_374'>      removed from the sanctuary and altar to a proper height in the</a>

<a id='line_377'>      impossible on either side to check the rapid through adverse</a>
<a id='line_378'>      impulse of veneration and abhorrence: in their lofty position,</a>
<a id='line_379'>      the sacred images still edified their votaries, and reproached</a>
<a id='line_380'>      the tyrant. He was himself provoked by resistance and invective;</a>
<a id='line_381'>      and his own party accused him of an imperfect discharge of his</a>
<a id='line_382'>      duty, and urged for his imitation the example of the Jewish king,</a>
<a id='line_383'>      who had broken without scruple the brazen serpent of the temple.</a>
<a id='line_384'>      By a second edict, he proscribed the existence as well as the use</a>
<a id='line_385'>      of religious pictures; the churches of Constantinople and the</a>
<a id='line_386'>      provinces were cleansed from idolatry; the images of Christ, the</a>
<a id='line_387'>      Virgin, and the saints, were demolished, or a smooth surface of</a>
<a id='line_388'>      plaster was spread over the walls of the edifice. The sect of the</a>
<a id='line_389'>      Iconoclasts was supported by the zeal and despotism of six</a>
<a id='line_390'>      emperors, and the East and West were involved in a noisy conflict</a>
<a id='line_391'>      of one hundred and twenty years. It was the design of Leo the</a>
<a id='line_392'>      Isaurian to pronounce the condemnation of images as an article of</a>
<a id='line_393'>      faith, and by the authority of a general council: but the</a>
<a id='line_394'>      convocation of such an assembly was reserved for his son</a>
<a id='line_395'>      Constantine; 19 and though it is stigmatized by triumphant</a>
<a id='line_396'>      bigotry as a meeting of fools and atheists, their own partial and</a>
<a id='line_397'>      mutilated acts betray many symptoms of reason and piety. The</a>
<a id='line_398'>      debates and decrees of many provincial synods introduced the</a>
<a id='line_399'>      summons of the general council which met in the suburbs of</a>
<a id='line_400'>      Constantinople, and was composed of the respectable number of</a>
<a id='line_401'>      three hundred and thirty-eight bishops of Europe and Anatolia;</a>
<a id='line_402'>      for the patriarchs of Antioch and Alexandria were the slaves of</a>
<a id='line_403'>      the caliph, and the Roman pontiff had withdrawn the churches of</a>
<a id='line_404'>      Italy and the West from the communion of the Greeks. This</a>
<a id='line_405'>      Byzantine synod assumed the rank and powers of the seventh</a>
<a id='line_406'>      general council; yet even this title was a recognition of the six</a>
<a id='line_407'>      preceding assemblies, which had laboriously built the structure</a>
<a id='line_408'>      of the Catholic faith. After a serious deliberation of six</a>
<a id='line_409'>      months, the three hundred and thirty-eight bishops pronounced and</a>
<a id='line_410'>      subscribed a unanimous decree, that all visible symbols of</a>
<a id='line_411'>      Christ, except in the Eucharist, were either blasphemous or</a>
<a id='line_412'>      heretical; that image-worship was a corruption of Christianity</a>
<a id='line_413'>      and a renewal of Paganism; that all such monuments of idolatry</a>
<a id='line_414'>      should be broken or erased; and that those who should refuse to</a>
<a id='line_415'>      deliver the objects of their private superstition, were guilty of</a>
<a id='line_416'>      disobedience to the authority of the church and of the emperor.</a>
<a id='line_417'>      In their loud and loyal acclamations, they celebrated the merits</a>
<a id='line_418'>      of their temporal redeemer; and to his zeal and justice they</a>
<a id='line_419'>      intrusted the execution of their spiritual censures. At</a>
<a id='line_420'>      Constantinople, as in the former councils, the will of the prince</a>
<a id='line_421'>      was the rule of episcopal faith; but on this occasion, I am</a>
<a id='line_422'>      inclined to suspect that a large majority of the prelates</a>
<a id='line_423'>      sacrificed their secret conscience to the temptations of hope and</a>
<a id='line_424'>      fear. In the long night of superstition, the Christians had</a>
<a id='line_425'>      wandered far away from the simplicity of the gospel: nor was it</a>
<a id='line_426'>      easy for them to discern the clew, and tread back the mazes, of</a>
<a id='line_427'>      the labyrinth. The worship of images was inseparably blended, at</a>
<a id='line_428'>      least to a pious fancy, with the Cross, the Virgin, the Saints</a>
<a id='line_429'>      and their relics; the holy ground was involved in a cloud of</a>
<a id='line_430'>      miracles and visions; and the nerves of the mind, curiosity and</a>

<a id='line_492'>      their consecrated banners, and boldly steered for the harbor of</a>
<a id='line_493'>      Constantinople, to place on the throne a new favorite of God and</a>
<a id='line_494'>      the people. They depended on the succor of a miracle: but their</a>
<a id='line_495'>      miracles were inefficient against the Greek fire; and, after the</a>
<a id='line_496'>      defeat and conflagration of the fleet, the naked islands were</a>
<a id='line_497'>      abandoned to the clemency or justice of the conqueror. The son of</a>
<a id='line_498'>      Leo, in the first year of his reign, had undertaken an expedition</a>
<a id='line_499'>      against the Saracens: during his absence, the capital, the</a>
<a id='line_500'>      palace, and the purple, were occupied by his kinsman Artavasdes,</a>
<a id='line_501'>      the ambitious champion of the orthodox faith. The worship of</a>
<a id='line_502'>      images was triumphantly restored: the patriarch renounced his</a>
<a id='line_503'>      dissimulation, or dissembled his sentiments and the righteous</a>
<a id='line_504'>      claims of the usurper was acknowledged, both in the new, and in</a>
<a id='line_505'>      ancient, Rome. Constantine flew for refuge to his paternal</a>
<a id='line_506'>      mountains; but he descended at the head of the bold and</a>
<a id='line_507'>      affectionate Isaurians; and his final victory confounded the arms</a>
<a id='line_508'>      and predictions of the fanatics. His long reign was distracted</a>
<a id='line_509'>      with clamor, sedition, conspiracy, and mutual hatred, and</a>
<a id='line_510'>      sanguinary revenge; the persecution of images was the motive or</a>
<a id='line_511'>      pretence, of his adversaries; and, if they missed a temporal</a>
<a id='line_512'>      diadem, they were rewarded by the Greeks with the crown of</a>
<a id='line_513'>      martyrdom. In every act of open and clandestine treason, the</a>
<a id='line_514'>      emperor felt the unforgiving enmity of the monks, the faithful</a>
<a id='line_515'>      slaves of the superstition to which they owed their riches and</a>
<a id='line_516'>      influence. They prayed, they preached, they absolved, they</a>
<a id='line_517'>      inflamed, they conspired; the solitude of Palestine poured forth</a>
<a id='line_518'>      a torrent of invective; and the pen of St. John Damascenus, 22</a>
<a id='line_519'>      the last of the Greek fathers, devoted the tyrant’s head, both in</a>
<a id='line_520'>      this world and the next. 23 2311 I am not at leisure to examine</a>
<a id='line_521'>      how far the monks provoked, nor how much they have exaggerated,</a>
<a id='line_522'>      their real and pretended sufferings, nor how many lost their</a>
<a id='line_523'>      lives or limbs, their eyes or their beards, by the cruelty of the</a>
<a id='line_524'>      emperor. 2312 From the chastisement of individuals, he proceeded</a>
<a id='line_525'>      to the abolition of the order; and, as it was wealthy and</a>
<a id='line_526'>      useless, his resentment might be stimulated by avarice, and</a>
<a id='line_527'>      justified by patriotism. The formidable name and mission of the</a>
<a id='line_528'>      Dragon, 24 his visitor-general, excited the terror and abhorrence</a>

<a id='line_534'>      monasteries. With the habit and profession of monks, the public</a>

<a id='line_614'>      the zeal and orthodoxy of these apostolical men. 26 The modern</a>
<a id='line_615'>      champions of Rome are eager to accept the praise and the</a>

<a id='line_699'>      monarchy. “During ten pure and fortunate years,” says Gregory to</a>
<a id='line_700'>      the emperor, “we have tasted the annual comfort of your royal</a>
<a id='line_701'>      letters, subscribed in purple ink, with your own hand, the sacred</a>
<a id='line_702'>      pledges of your attachment to the orthodox creed of our fathers.</a>

<a id='line_710'>      provoked to cast their horn-books at your head.” After this</a>
<a id='line_711'>      decent salutation, the pope attempts the usual distinction</a>
<a id='line_712'>      between the idols of antiquity and the Christian images. The</a>
<a id='line_713'>      former were the fanciful representations of phantoms or daemons,</a>

<a id='line_716'>      mother, and his saints, who had approved, by a crowd of miracles,</a>
<a id='line_717'>      the innocence and merit of this relative worship. He must indeed</a>
<a id='line_718'>      have trusted to the ignorance of Leo, since he could assert the</a>
<a id='line_719'>      perpetual use of images, from the apostolic age, and their</a>
<a id='line_720'>      venerable presence in the six synods of the Catholic church. A</a>

<a id='line_725'>      prince. To the impudent and inhuman Leo, more guilty than a</a>

<a id='line_727'>      his spiritual guides of Constantinople and Rome. The limits of</a>

<a id='line_819'>      was devoted to their father, and even the Lombards were ambitious</a>

<a id='line_821'>      treasonable act, but the most obvious revenge, was the</a>
<a id='line_822'>      destruction of the statues of Leo himself: the most effectual and</a>
<a id='line_823'>      pleasing measure of rebellion, was the withholding the tribute of</a>
<a id='line_824'>      Italy, and depriving him of a power which he had recently abused</a>
<a id='line_825'>      by the imposition of a new capitation. 38 A form of</a>
<a id='line_826'>      administration was preserved by the election of magistrates and</a>
<a id='line_827'>      governors; and so high was the public indignation, that the</a>
<a id='line_828'>      Italians were prepared to create an orthodox emperor, and to</a>
<a id='line_829'>      conduct him with a fleet and army to the palace of</a>
<a id='line_830'>      Constantinople. In that palace, the Roman bishops, the second and</a>
<a id='line_831'>      third Gregory, were condemned as the authors of the revolt, and</a>
<a id='line_832'>      every attempt was made, either by fraud or force, to seize their</a>
<a id='line_833'>      persons, and to strike at their lives. The city was repeatedly</a>
<a id='line_834'>      visited or assaulted by captains of the guards, and dukes and</a>
<a id='line_835'>      exarchs of high dignity or secret trust; they landed with foreign</a>
<a id='line_836'>      troops, they obtained some domestic aid, and the superstition of</a>
<a id='line_837'>      Naples may blush that her fathers were attached to the cause of</a>
<a id='line_838'>      heresy. But these clandestine or open attacks were repelled by</a>
<a id='line_839'>      the courage and vigilance of the Romans; the Greeks were</a>
<a id='line_840'>      overthrown and massacred, their leaders suffered an ignominious</a>
<a id='line_841'>      death, and the popes, however inclined to mercy, refused to</a>
<a id='line_842'>      intercede for these guilty victims. At Ravenna, 39 the several</a>
<a id='line_843'>      quarters of the city had long exercised a bloody and hereditary</a>
<a id='line_844'>      feud; in religious controversy they found a new aliment of</a>
<a id='line_845'>      faction: but the votaries of images were superior in numbers or</a>
<a id='line_846'>      spirit, and the exarch, who attempted to stem the torrent, lost</a>
<a id='line_847'>      his life in a popular sedition. To punish this flagitious deed,</a>
<a id='line_848'>      and restore his dominion in Italy, the emperor sent a fleet and</a>
<a id='line_849'>      army into the Adriatic Gulf. After suffering from the winds and</a>
<a id='line_850'>      waves much loss and delay, the Greeks made their descent in the</a>
<a id='line_851'>      neighborhood of Ravenna: they threatened to depopulate the guilty</a>
<a id='line_852'>      capital, and to imitate, perhaps to surpass, the example of</a>
<a id='line_853'>      Justinian the Second, who had chastised a former rebellion by the</a>
<a id='line_854'>      choice and execution of fifty of the principal inhabitants. The</a>
<a id='line_855'>      women and clergy, in sackcloth and ashes, lay prostrate in</a>
<a id='line_856'>      prayer: the men were in arms for the defence of their country;</a>
<a id='line_857'>      the common danger had united the factions, and the event of a</a>
<a id='line_858'>      battle was preferred to the slow miseries of a siege. In a</a>
<a id='line_859'>      hard-fought day, as the two armies alternately yielded and</a>
<a id='line_860'>      advanced, a phantom was seen, a voice was heard, and Ravenna was</a>
<a id='line_861'>      victorious by the assurance of victory. The strangers retreated</a>
<a id='line_862'>      to their ships, but the populous sea-coast poured forth a</a>
<a id='line_863'>      multitude of boats; the waters of the Po were so deeply infected</a>
<a id='line_864'>      with blood, that during six years the public prejudice abstained</a>
<a id='line_865'>      from the fish of the river; and the institution of an annual</a>
<a id='line_866'>      feast perpetuated the worship of images, and the abhorrence of</a>
<a id='line_867'>      the Greek tyrant. Amidst the triumph of the Catholic arms, the</a>
<a id='line_868'>      Roman pontiff convened a synod of ninety-three bishops against</a>
<a id='line_869'>      the heresy of the Iconoclasts. With their consent, he pronounced</a>
<a id='line_870'>      a general excommunication against all who by word or deed should</a>
<a id='line_871'>      attack the tradition of the fathers and the images of the saints:</a>
<a id='line_872'>      in this sentence the emperor was tacitly involved, 40 but the</a>
<a id='line_873'>      vote of a last and hopeless remonstrance may seem to imply that</a>
<a id='line_874'>      the anathema was yet suspended over his guilty head. No sooner</a>
<a id='line_875'>      had they confirmed their own safety, the worship of images, and</a>
<a id='line_876'>      the freedom of Rome and Italy, than the popes appear to have</a>
<a id='line_877'>      relaxed of their severity, and to have spared the relics of the</a>
<a id='line_878'>      Byzantine dominion. Their moderate councils delayed and prevented</a>

<a id='line_937'>      territory from Viterbo to Terracina, and from Narni to the mouth</a>
<a id='line_938'>      of the Tyber. 42 When the kings were banished, the republic</a>
<a id='line_939'>      reposed on the firm basis which had been founded by their wisdom</a>
<a id='line_940'>      and virtue. Their perpetual jurisdiction was divided between two</a>
<a id='line_941'>      annual magistrates: the senate continued to exercise the powers</a>
<a id='line_942'>      of administration and counsel; and the legislative authority was</a>
<a id='line_943'>      distributed in the assemblies of the people, by a</a>
<a id='line_944'>      well-proportioned scale of property and service. Ignorant of the</a>
<a id='line_945'>      arts of luxury, the primitive Romans had improved the science of</a>
<a id='line_946'>      government and war: the will of the community was absolute: the</a>
<a id='line_947'>      rights of individuals were sacred: one hundred and thirty</a>
<a id='line_948'>      thousand citizens were armed for defence or conquest; and a band</a>
<a id='line_949'>      of robbers and outlaws was moulded into a nation deserving of</a>
<a id='line_950'>      freedom and ambitious of glory. 43 When the sovereignty of the</a>
<a id='line_951'>      Greek emperors was extinguished, the ruins of Rome presented the</a>
<a id='line_952'>      sad image of depopulation and decay: her slavery was a habit, her</a>
<a id='line_953'>      liberty an accident; the effect of superstition, and the object</a>
<a id='line_954'>      of her own amazement and terror. The last vestige of the</a>
<a id='line_955'>      substance, or even the forms, of the constitution, was</a>
<a id='line_956'>      obliterated from the practice and memory of the Romans; and they</a>
<a id='line_957'>      were devoid of knowledge, or virtue, again to build the fabric of</a>
<a id='line_958'>      a commonwealth. Their scanty remnant, the offspring of slaves and</a>
<a id='line_959'>      strangers, was despicable in the eyes of the victorious</a>
<a id='line_960'>      Barbarians. As often as the Franks or Lombards expressed their</a>
<a id='line_961'>      most bitter contempt of a foe, they called him a Roman; “and in</a>
<a id='line_962'>      this name,” says the bishop Liutprand, “we include whatever is</a>
<a id='line_963'>      base, whatever is cowardly, whatever is perfidious, the extremes</a>
<a id='line_964'>      of avarice and luxury, and every vice that can prostitute the</a>
<a id='line_965'>      dignity of human nature.” 44 441 By the necessity of their</a>
<a id='line_966'>      situation, the inhabitants of Rome were cast into the rough model</a>
<a id='line_967'>      of a republican government: they were compelled to elect some</a>
<a id='line_968'>      judges in peace, and some leaders in war: the nobles assembled to</a>
<a id='line_969'>      deliberate, and their resolves could not be executed without the</a>
<a id='line_970'>      union and consent of the multitude. The style of the Roman senate</a>
<a id='line_971'>      and people was revived, 45 but the spirit was fled; and their new</a>
<a id='line_972'>      independence was disgraced by the tumultuous conflict of</a>
<a id='line_973'>      vicentiousness and oppression. The want of laws could only be</a>
<a id='line_974'>      supplied by the influence of religion, and their foreign and</a>

<a id='line_1045'>      of Gregory the Second, 48 withdrew his troops, resigned his</a>

<a id='line_1048'>      cuirass and mantle, his silver cross, and his crown of gold, on</a>
<a id='line_1049'>      the tomb of the apostle. But this religious fervor was the</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      illusion, perhaps the artifice, of the moment; the sense of</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      interest is strong and lasting; the love of arms and rapine was</a>

<a id='line_1053'>      irresistibly tempted by the disorders of Italy, the nakedness of</a>

<a id='line_1061'>      fortress were speedily recovered by the active diligence and</a>

<a id='line_1063'>      obeyed the exhortation of Gregory himself, in separating the</a>

<a id='line_1069'>      evaporated without effect, but the policy of Liutprand alarmed</a>

<a id='line_1121'>      prevented his interference in the affairs of Italy, except by a</a>
<a id='line_1122'>      friendly and ineffectual mediation. His son Pepin, the heir of</a>
<a id='line_1123'>      his power and virtues, assumed the office of champion of the</a>
<a id='line_1124'>      Roman church; and the zeal of the French prince appears to have</a>

<a id='line_1129'>      generous resolution of visiting in person the courts of Lombardy</a>
<a id='line_1130'>      and France, to deprecate the injustice of his enemy, or to excite</a>
<a id='line_1131'>      the pity and indignation of his friend. After soothing the public</a>

<a id='line_1135'>      could not silence the complaints, nor retard the speed of the</a>
<a id='line_1136'>      Roman pontiff, who traversed the Pennine Alps, reposed in the</a>
<a id='line_1137'>      abbey of St. Maurice, and hastened to grasp the right hand of his</a>
<a id='line_1138'>      protector; a hand which was never lifted in vain, either in war</a>
<a id='line_1139'>      or friendship. Stephen was entertained as the visible successor</a>
<a id='line_1140'>      of the apostle; at the next assembly, the field of March or of</a>
<a id='line_1141'>      May, his injuries were exposed to a devout and warlike nation,</a>
<a id='line_1142'>      and he repassed the Alps, not as a suppliant, but as a conqueror,</a>
<a id='line_1143'>      at the head of a French army, which was led by the king in</a>
<a id='line_1144'>      person. The Lombards, after a weak resistance, obtained an</a>
<a id='line_1145'>      ignominious peace, and swore to restore the possessions, and to</a>
<a id='line_1146'>      respect the sanctity, of the Roman church. But no sooner was</a>
<a id='line_1147'>      Astolphus delivered from the presence of the French arms, than he</a>
<a id='line_1148'>      forgot his promise and resented his disgrace. Rome was again</a>
<a id='line_1149'>      encompassed by his arms; and Stephen, apprehensive of fatiguing</a>
<a id='line_1150'>      the zeal of his Transalpine allies enforced his complaint and</a>
<a id='line_1151'>      request by an eloquent letter in the name and person of St. Peter</a>
<a id='line_1152'>      himself. 52 The apostle assures his adopted sons, the king, the</a>
<a id='line_1153'>      clergy, and the nobles of France, that, dead in the flesh, he is</a>
<a id='line_1154'>      still alive in the spirit; that they now hear, and must obey, the</a>
<a id='line_1155'>      voice of the founder and guardian of the Roman church; that the</a>
<a id='line_1156'>      Virgin, the angels, the saints, and the martyrs, and all the host</a>
<a id='line_1157'>      of heaven, unanimously urge the request, and will confess the</a>
<a id='line_1158'>      obligation; that riches, victory, and paradise, will crown their</a>
<a id='line_1159'>      pious enterprise, and that eternal damnation will be the penalty</a>
<a id='line_1160'>      of their neglect, if they suffer his tomb, his temple, and his</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      people, to fall into the hands of the perfidious Lombards. The</a>
<a id='line_1162'>      second expedition of Pepin was not less rapid and fortunate than</a>
<a id='line_1163'>      the first: St. Peter was satisfied, Rome was again saved, and</a>
<a id='line_1164'>      Astolphus was taught the lessons of justice and sincerity by the</a>
<a id='line_1165'>      scourge of a foreign master. After this double chastisement, the</a>
<a id='line_1166'>      Lombards languished about twenty years in a state of languor and</a>
<a id='line_1167'>      decay. But their minds were not yet humbled to their condition;</a>
<a id='line_1168'>      and instead of affecting the pacific virtues of the feeble, they</a>
<a id='line_1169'>      peevishly harassed the Romans with a repetition of claims,</a>
<a id='line_1170'>      evasions, and inroads, which they undertook without reflection,</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      and terminated without glory. On either side, their expiring</a>
<a id='line_1172'>      monarchy was pressed by the zeal and prudence of Pope Adrian the</a>
<a id='line_1173'>      First, the genius, the fortune, and greatness of Charlemagne, the</a>
<a id='line_1174'>      son of Pepin; these heroes of the church and state were united in</a>

<a id='line_1176'>      prostrate, they varnished their proceedings with the fairest</a>
<a id='line_1177'>      colors of equity and moderation. 53 The passes of the Alps, and</a>
<a id='line_1178'>      the walls of Pavia, were the only defence of the Lombards; the</a>
<a id='line_1179'>      former were surprised, the latter were invested, by the son of</a>

<a id='line_1230'>      of the Tyber, their kings, their laws, and the oracles of their</a>
<a id='line_1231'>      fate. The Franks were perplexed between the name and substance of</a>
<a id='line_1232'>      their government. All the powers of royalty were exercised by</a>
<a id='line_1233'>      Pepin, mayor of the palace; and nothing, except the regal title,</a>
<a id='line_1234'>      was wanting to his ambition. His enemies were crushed by his</a>
<a id='line_1235'>      valor; his friends were multiplied by his liberality; his father</a>
<a id='line_1236'>      had been the savior of Christendom; and the claims of personal</a>
<a id='line_1237'>      merit were repeated and ennobled in a descent of four</a>
<a id='line_1238'>      generations. The name and image of royalty was still preserved in</a>
<a id='line_1239'>      the last descendant of Clovis, the feeble Childeric; but his</a>
<a id='line_1240'>      obsolete right could only be used as an instrument of sedition:</a>
<a id='line_1241'>      the nation was desirous of restoring the simplicity of the</a>
<a id='line_1242'>      constitution; and Pepin, a subject and a prince, was ambitious to</a>
<a id='line_1243'>      ascertain his own rank and the fortune of his family. The mayor</a>
<a id='line_1244'>      and the nobles were bound, by an oath of fidelity, to the royal</a>
<a id='line_1245'>      phantom: the blood of Clovis was pure and sacred in their eyes;</a>
<a id='line_1246'>      and their common ambassadors addressed the Roman pontiff, to</a>
<a id='line_1247'>      dispel their scruples, or to absolve their promise. The interest</a>
<a id='line_1248'>      of Pope Zachary, the successor of the two Gregories, prompted him</a>
<a id='line_1249'>      to decide, and to decide in their favor: he pronounced that the</a>
<a id='line_1250'>      nation might lawfully unite in the same person the title and</a>
<a id='line_1251'>      authority of king; and that the unfortunate Childeric, a victim</a>
<a id='line_1252'>      of the public safety, should be degraded, shaved, and confined in</a>
<a id='line_1253'>      a monastery for the remainder of his days. An answer so agreeable</a>
<a id='line_1254'>      to their wishes was accepted by the Franks as the opinion of a</a>
<a id='line_1255'>      casuist, the sentence of a judge, or the oracle of a prophet: the</a>
<a id='line_1256'>      Merovingian race disappeared from the earth; and Pepin was</a>
<a id='line_1257'>      exalted on a buckler by the suffrage of a free people, accustomed</a>
<a id='line_1258'>      to obey his laws and to march under his standard. His coronation</a>
<a id='line_1259'>      was twice performed, with the sanction of the popes, by their</a>
<a id='line_1260'>      most faithful servant St. Boniface, the apostle of Germany, and</a>
<a id='line_1261'>      by the grateful hands of Stephen the Third, who, in the monastery</a>
<a id='line_1262'>      of St. Denys placed the diadem on the head of his benefactor. The</a>
<a id='line_1263'>      royal unction of the kings of Israel was dexterously applied: 56</a>
<a id='line_1264'>      the successor of St. Peter assumed the character of a divine</a>

<a id='line_1311'>      magistrate; he was indifferently styled the exarch or the</a>
<a id='line_1312'>      patrician; and these governors of Ravenna, who fill their place</a>
<a id='line_1313'>      in the chronology of princes, extended their jurisdiction over</a>
<a id='line_1314'>      the Roman city. Since the revolt of Italy and the loss of the</a>
<a id='line_1315'>      Exarchate, the distress of the Romans had exacted some sacrifice</a>
<a id='line_1316'>      of their independence. Yet, even in this act, they exercised the</a>
<a id='line_1317'>      right of disposing of themselves; and the decrees of the senate</a>
<a id='line_1318'>      and people successively invested Charles Martel and his posterity</a>
<a id='line_1319'>      with the honors of patrician of Rome. The leaders of a powerful</a>
<a id='line_1320'>      nation would have disdained a servile title and subordinate</a>
<a id='line_1321'>      office; but the reign of the Greek emperors was suspended; and,</a>
<a id='line_1322'>      in the vacancy of the empire, they derived a more glorious</a>
<a id='line_1323'>      commission from the pope and the republic. The Roman ambassadors</a>
<a id='line_1324'>      presented these patricians with the keys of the shrine of St.</a>
<a id='line_1325'>      Peter, as a pledge and symbol of sovereignty; with a holy banner</a>
<a id='line_1326'>      which it was their right and duty to unfurl in the defence of the</a>
<a id='line_1327'>      church and city. 59 In the time of Charles Martel and of Pepin,</a>
<a id='line_1328'>      the interposition of the Lombard kingdom covered the freedom,</a>
<a id='line_1329'>      while it threatened the safety, of Rome; and the patriciate</a>
<a id='line_1330'>      represented only the title, the service, the alliance, of these</a>
<a id='line_1331'>      distant protectors. The power and policy of Charlemagne</a>
<a id='line_1332'>      annihilated an enemy, and imposed a master. In his first visit to</a>
<a id='line_1333'>      the capital, he was received with all the honors which had</a>
<a id='line_1334'>      formerly been paid to the exarch, the representative of the</a>
<a id='line_1335'>      emperor; and these honors obtained some new decorations from the</a>
<a id='line_1336'>      joy and gratitude of Pope Adrian the First. 60 No sooner was he</a>
<a id='line_1337'>      informed of the sudden approach of the monarch, than he</a>
<a id='line_1338'>      despatched the magistrates and nobles of Rome to meet him, with</a>
<a id='line_1339'>      the banner, about thirty miles from the city. At the distance of</a>
<a id='line_1340'>      one mile, the Flaminian way was lined with the schools, or</a>
<a id='line_1341'>      national communities, of Greeks, Lombards, Saxons, &c.: the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1342'>      youth were under arms; and the children of a more tender age,</a>
<a id='line_1343'>      with palms and olive branches in their hands, chanted the praises</a>
<a id='line_1344'>      of their great deliverer. At the aspect of the holy crosses, and</a>
<a id='line_1345'>      ensigns of the saints, he dismounted from his horse, led the</a>
<a id='line_1346'>      procession of his nobles to the Vatican, and, as he ascended the</a>
<a id='line_1347'>      stairs, devoutly kissed each step of the threshold of the</a>
<a id='line_1348'>      apostles. In the portico, Adrian expected him at the head of his</a>

<a id='line_1354'>      Rome, which had been delivered by the sword, was subject, as his</a>

<a id='line_1654'>      decrees of a general council could only be repealed by a similar</a>
<a id='line_1655'>      assembly: 78 the Iconoclasts whom she convened were bold in</a>
<a id='line_1656'>      possession, and averse to debate; and the feeble voice of the</a>
<a id='line_1657'>      bishops was reechoed by the more formidable clamor of the</a>
<a id='line_1658'>      soldiers and people of Constantinople. The delay and intrigues of</a>
<a id='line_1659'>      a year, the separation of the disaffected troops, and the choice</a>
<a id='line_1660'>      of Nice for a second orthodox synod, removed these obstacles; and</a>
<a id='line_1661'>      the episcopal conscience was again, after the Greek fashion, in</a>
<a id='line_1662'>      the hands of the prince. No more than eighteen days were allowed</a>
<a id='line_1663'>      for the consummation of this important work: the Iconoclasts</a>
<a id='line_1664'>      appeared, not as judges, but as criminals or penitents: the scene</a>
<a id='line_1665'>      was decorated by the legates of Pope Adrian and the Eastern</a>
<a id='line_1666'>      patriarchs, 79 the decrees were framed by the president Taracius,</a>
<a id='line_1667'>      and ratified by the acclamations and subscriptions of three</a>
<a id='line_1668'>      hundred and fifty bishops. They unanimously pronounced, that the</a>
<a id='line_1669'>      worship of images is agreeable to Scripture and reason, to the</a>
<a id='line_1670'>      fathers and councils of the church: but they hesitate whether</a>
<a id='line_1671'>      that worship be relative or direct; whether the Godhead, and the</a>
<a id='line_1672'>      figure of Christ, be entitled to the same mode of adoration. Of</a>
<a id='line_1673'>      this second Nicene council the acts are still extant; a curious</a>
<a id='line_1674'>      monument of superstition and ignorance, of falsehood and folly. I</a>
<a id='line_1675'>      shall only notice the judgment of the bishops on the comparative</a>
<a id='line_1676'>      merit of image-worship and morality. A monk had concluded a truce</a>
<a id='line_1677'>      with the daemon of fornication, on condition of interrupting his</a>
<a id='line_1678'>      daily prayers to a picture that hung in his cell. His scruples</a>
<a id='line_1679'>      prompted him to consult the abbot. “Rather than abstain from</a>
<a id='line_1680'>      adoring Christ and his Mother in their holy images, it would be</a>
<a id='line_1681'>      better for you,” replied the casuist, “to enter every brothel,</a>
<a id='line_1682'>      and visit every prostitute, in the city.” 80 For the honor of</a>
<a id='line_1683'>      orthodoxy, at least the orthodoxy of the Roman church, it is</a>
<a id='line_1684'>      somewhat unfortunate, that the two princes who convened the two</a>
<a id='line_1685'>      councils of Nice are both stained with the blood of their sons.</a>
<a id='line_1686'>      The second of these assemblies was approved and rigorously</a>
<a id='line_1687'>      executed by the despotism of Irene, and she refused her</a>
<a id='line_1688'>      adversaries the toleration which at first she had granted to her</a>
<a id='line_1689'>      friends. During the five succeeding reigns, a period of</a>
<a id='line_1690'>      thirty-eight years, the contest was maintained, with unabated</a>
<a id='line_1691'>      rage and various success, between the worshippers and the</a>
<a id='line_1692'>      breakers of the images; but I am not inclined to pursue with</a>
<a id='line_1693'>      minute diligence the repetition of the same events. Nicephorus</a>
<a id='line_1694'>      allowed a general liberty of speech and practice; and the only</a>
<a id='line_1695'>      virtue of his reign is accused by the monks as the cause of his</a>
<a id='line_1696'>      temporal and eternal perdition. Superstition and weakness formed</a>
<a id='line_1697'>      the character of Michael the First, but the saints and images</a>
<a id='line_1698'>      were incapable of supporting their votary on the throne. In the</a>
<a id='line_1699'>      purple, Leo the Fifth asserted the name and religion of an</a>
<a id='line_1700'>      Armenian; and the idols, with their seditious adherents, were</a>
<a id='line_1701'>      condemned to a second exile. Their applause would have sanctified</a>
<a id='line_1702'>      the murder of an impious tyrant, but his assassin and successor,</a>
<a id='line_1703'>      the second Michael, was tainted from his birth with the Phrygian</a>
<a id='line_1704'>      heresies: he attempted to mediate between the contending parties;</a>
<a id='line_1705'>      and the intractable spirit of the Catholics insensibly cast him</a>
<a id='line_1706'>      into the opposite scale. His moderation was guarded by timidity;</a>
<a id='line_1707'>      but his son Theophilus, alike ignorant of fear and pity, was the</a>
<a id='line_1708'>      last and most cruel of the Iconoclasts. The enthusiasm of the</a>
<a id='line_1709'>      times ran strongly against them; and the emperors who stemmed the</a>
<a id='line_1710'>      torrent were exasperated and punished by the public hatred. After</a>
<a id='line_1711'>      the death of Theophilus, the final victory of the images was</a>
<a id='line_1712'>      achieved by a second female, his widow Theodora, whom he left the</a>
<a id='line_1713'>      guardian of the empire. Her measures were bold and decisive. The</a>
<a id='line_1714'>      fiction of a tardy repentance absolved the fame and the soul of</a>
<a id='line_1715'>      her deceased husband; the sentence of the Iconoclast patriarch</a>
<a id='line_1716'>      was commuted from the loss of his eyes to a whipping of two</a>
<a id='line_1717'>      hundred lashes: the bishops trembled, the monks shouted, and the</a>
<a id='line_1718'>      festival of orthodoxy preserves the annual memory of the triumph</a>
<a id='line_1719'>      of the images. A single question yet remained, whether they are</a>
<a id='line_1720'>      endowed with any proper and inherent sanctity; it was agitated by</a>
<a id='line_1721'>      the Greeks of the eleventh century; 81 and as this opinion has</a>
<a id='line_1722'>      the strongest recommendation of absurdity, I am surprised that it</a>
<a id='line_1723'>      was not more explicitly decided in the affirmative. In the West,</a>
<a id='line_1724'>      Pope Adrian the First accepted and announced the decrees of the</a>
<a id='line_1725'>      Nicene assembly, which is now revered by the Catholics as the</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      seventh in rank of the general councils. Rome and Italy were</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      docile to the voice of their father; but the greatest part of the</a>
<a id='line_1728'>      Latin Christians were far behind in the race of superstition. The</a>
<a id='line_1729'>      churches of France, Germany, England, and Spain, steered a middle</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      course between the adoration and the destruction of images, which</a>

<a id='line_1807'>      It was after the Nycene synod, and under the reign of the pious</a>
<a id='line_1808'>      Irene, that the popes consummated the separation of Rome and</a>
<a id='line_1809'>      Italy, by the translation of the empire to the less orthodox</a>
<a id='line_1810'>      Charlemagne. They were compelled to choose between the rival</a>

<a id='line_1815'>      enmity of the two capitals; and they were alienated from each</a>
<a id='line_1816'>      other by the hostile opposition of seventy years. In that schism</a>
<a id='line_1817'>      the Romans had tasted of freedom, and the popes of sovereignty:</a>
<a id='line_1818'>      their submission would have exposed them to the revenge of a</a>
<a id='line_1819'>      jealous tyrant; and the revolution of Italy had betrayed the</a>
<a id='line_1820'>      impotence, as well as the tyranny, of the Byzantine court. The</a>
<a id='line_1821'>      Greek emperors had restored the images, but they had not restored</a>

<a id='line_1827'>      breath of the reigning monarch: the Franks were now contumacious;</a>
<a id='line_1828'>      but a discerning eye might discern their approaching conversion,</a>
<a id='line_1829'>      from the use, to the adoration, of images. The name of</a>
<a id='line_1830'>      Charlemagne was stained by the polemic acrimony of his scribes;</a>
<a id='line_1831'>      but the conqueror himself conformed, with the temper of a</a>
<a id='line_1832'>      statesman, to the various practice of France and Italy. In his</a>

<a id='line_1913'>      tongue, of which he had been deprived, twice deprived, by the</a>
<a id='line_1914'>      knife of the assassins. 91 From his prison he escaped to the</a>
<a id='line_1915'>      Vatican: the duke of Spoleto hastened to his rescue, Charlemagne</a>

<a id='line_1920'>      innocence; and it was not without reluctance, that the conqueror</a>
<a id='line_1921'>      of the Saxons delayed till the ensuing year the personal</a>

<a id='line_1926'>      sacrilegious attempt against his life was punished by the mild</a>
<a id='line_1927'>      and insufficient penalty of exile. On the festival of Christmas,</a>
<a id='line_1928'>      the last year of the eighth century, Charlemagne appeared in the</a>

<a id='line_1930'>      exchanged the simple dress of his country for the habit of a</a>
<a id='line_1931'>      patrician. 92 After the celebration of the holy mysteries, Leo</a>

<a id='line_1939'>      and privileges of the church; and the first-fruits were paid in</a>
<a id='line_1940'>      his rich offerings to the shrine of his apostle. In his familiar</a>

<a id='line_1945'>      Charlemagne reveals his knowledge and expectation: he had</a>

<a id='line_2009'>      discern some blemishes in the sanctity and greatness of the</a>

<a id='line_2015'>      long celibacy and licentious manners of his daughters, 97 whom</a>

<a id='line_2017'>      shall be scarcely permitted to accuse the ambition of a</a>
<a id='line_2018'>      conqueror; but in a day of equal retribution, the sons of his</a>
<a id='line_2019'>      brother Carloman, the Merovingian princes of Aquitain, and the</a>
<a id='line_2020'>      four thousand five hundred Saxons who were beheaded on the same</a>
<a id='line_2021'>      spot, would have something to allege against the justice and</a>
<a id='line_2022'>      humanity of Charlemagne. His treatment of the vanquished Saxons</a>
<a id='line_2023'>      98 was an abuse of the right of conquest; his laws were not less</a>
<a id='line_2024'>      sanguinary than his arms, and in the discussion of his motives,</a>
<a id='line_2025'>      whatever is subtracted from bigotry must be imputed to temper.</a>
<a id='line_2026'>      The sedentary reader is amazed by his incessant activity of mind</a>
<a id='line_2027'>      and body; and his subjects and enemies were not less astonished</a>
<a id='line_2028'>      at his sudden presence, at the moment when they believed him at</a>
<a id='line_2029'>      the most distant extremity of the empire; neither peace nor war,</a>
<a id='line_2030'>      nor summer nor winter, were a season of repose; and our fancy</a>
<a id='line_2031'>      cannot easily reconcile the annals of his reign with the</a>
<a id='line_2032'>      geography of his expeditions. 981 But this activity was a</a>
<a id='line_2033'>      national, rather than a personal, virtue; the vagrant life of a</a>
<a id='line_2034'>      Frank was spent in the chase, in pilgrimage, in military</a>
<a id='line_2035'>      adventures; and the journeys of Charlemagne were distinguished</a>
<a id='line_2036'>      only by a more numerous train and a more important purpose. His</a>
<a id='line_2037'>      military renown must be tried by the scrutiny of his troops, his</a>
<a id='line_2038'>      enemies, and his actions. Alexander conquered with the arms of</a>
<a id='line_2039'>      Philip, but the two heroes who preceded Charlemagne bequeathed</a>
<a id='line_2040'>      him their name, their examples, and the companions of their</a>
<a id='line_2041'>      victories. At the head of his veteran and superior armies, he</a>
<a id='line_2042'>      oppressed the savage or degenerate nations, who were incapable of</a>
<a id='line_2043'>      confederating for their common safety: nor did he ever encounter</a>
<a id='line_2044'>      an equal antagonist in numbers, in discipline, or in arms The</a>
<a id='line_2045'>      science of war has been lost and revived with the arts of peace;</a>
<a id='line_2046'>      but his campaigns are not illustrated by any siege or battle of</a>
<a id='line_2047'>      singular difficulty and success; and he might behold, with envy,</a>
<a id='line_2048'>      the Saracen trophies of his grandfather. After the Spanish</a>
<a id='line_2049'>      expedition, his rear-guard was defeated in the Pyrenaean</a>
<a id='line_2050'>      mountains; and the soldiers, whose situation was irretrievable,</a>
<a id='line_2051'>      and whose valor was useless, might accuse, with their last</a>
<a id='line_2052'>      breath, the want of skill or caution of their general. 99 I touch</a>
<a id='line_2053'>      with reverence the laws of Charlemagne, so highly applauded by a</a>
<a id='line_2054'>      respectable judge. They compose not a system, but a series, of</a>
<a id='line_2055'>      occasional and minute edicts, for the correction of abuses, the</a>
<a id='line_2056'>      reformation of manners, the economy of his farms, the care of his</a>
<a id='line_2057'>      poultry, and even the sale of his eggs. He wished to improve the</a>
<a id='line_2058'>      laws and the character of the Franks; and his attempts, however</a>
<a id='line_2059'>      feeble and imperfect, are deserving of praise: the inveterate</a>
<a id='line_2060'>      evils of the times were suspended or mollified by his government;</a>
<a id='line_2061'>      100 but in his institutions I can seldom discover the general</a>
<a id='line_2062'>      views and the immortal spirit of a legislator, who survives</a>
<a id='line_2063'>      himself for the benefit of posterity. The union and stability of</a>
<a id='line_2064'>      his empire depended on the life of a single man: he imitated the</a>
<a id='line_2065'>      dangerous practice of dividing his kingdoms among his sons; and</a>
<a id='line_2066'>      after his numerous diets, the whole constitution was left to</a>
<a id='line_2067'>      fluctuate between the disorders of anarchy and despotism. His</a>
<a id='line_2068'>      esteem for the piety and knowledge of the clergy tempted him to</a>
<a id='line_2069'>      intrust that aspiring order with temporal dominion and civil</a>
<a id='line_2070'>      jurisdiction; and his son Lewis, when he was stripped and</a>
<a id='line_2071'>      degraded by the bishops, might accuse, in some measure, the</a>
<a id='line_2072'>      imprudence of his father. His laws enforced the imposition of</a>
<a id='line_2073'>      tithes, because the daemons had proclaimed in the air that the</a>
<a id='line_2074'>      default of payment had been the cause of the last scarcity. 101</a>
<a id='line_2075'>      The literary merits of Charlemagne are attested by the foundation</a>
<a id='line_2076'>      of schools, the introduction of arts, the works which were</a>
<a id='line_2077'>      published in his name, and his familiar connection with the</a>
<a id='line_2078'>      subjects and strangers whom he invited to his court to educate</a>
<a id='line_2079'>      both the prince and people. His own studies were tardy,</a>
<a id='line_2080'>      laborious, and imperfect; if he spoke Latin, and understood</a>
<a id='line_2081'>      Greek, he derived the rudiments of knowledge from conversation,</a>
<a id='line_2082'>      rather than from books; and, in his mature age, the emperor</a>
<a id='line_2083'>      strove to acquire the practice of writing, which every peasant</a>
<a id='line_2084'>      now learns in his infancy. 102 The grammar and logic, the music</a>
<a id='line_2085'>      and astronomy, of the times, were only cultivated as the</a>
<a id='line_2086'>      handmaids of superstition; but the curiosity of the human mind</a>
<a id='line_2087'>      must ultimately tend to its improvement, and the encouragement of</a>
<a id='line_2088'>      learning reflects the purest and most pleasing lustre on the</a>
<a id='line_2089'>      character of Charlemagne. 103 The dignity of his person, 104 the</a>
<a id='line_2090'>      length of his reign, the prosperity of his arms, the vigor of his</a>
<a id='line_2091'>      government, and the reverence of distant nations, distinguish him</a>

<a id='line_2200'>      Germany, and Hungary. 106 I. The Roman province of Gaul had been</a>
<a id='line_2201'>      transformed into the name and monarchy of France; but, in the</a>
<a id='line_2202'>      decay of the Merovingian line, its limits were contracted by the</a>
<a id='line_2203'>      independence of the Britons and the revolt of Aquitain.</a>
<a id='line_2204'>      Charlemagne pursued, and confined, the Britons on the shores of</a>

<a id='line_2210'></a>
<a id='line_2211'>      Harsh and rigorous would have been such treatment of ambitious</a>
<a id='line_2212'>      governors, who had too faithfully copied the mayors of the</a>
<a id='line_2213'>      palace. But a recent discovery 107 has proved that these unhappy</a>
<a id='line_2214'>      princes were the last and lawful heirs of the blood and sceptre</a>
<a id='line_2215'>      of Clovis, and younger branch, from the brother of Dagobert, of</a>
<a id='line_2216'>      the Merovingian house. Their ancient kingdom was reduced to the</a>

<a id='line_2218'>      the foot of the Pyrenees: their race was propagated till the</a>
<a id='line_2219'>      beginning of the sixteenth century; and after surviving their</a>
<a id='line_2220'>      Carlovingian tyrants, they were reserved to feel the injustice,</a>
<a id='line_2221'>      or the favors, of a third dynasty. By the reunion of Aquitain,</a>
<a id='line_2222'>      France was enlarged to its present boundaries, with the additions</a>

<a id='line_2225'>      The Saracens had been expelled from France by the grandfather and</a>
<a id='line_2226'>      father of Charlemagne; but they still possessed the greatest part</a>
<a id='line_2227'>      of Spain, from the rock of Gibraltar to the Pyrenees. Amidst</a>
<a id='line_2228'>      their civil divisions, an Arabian emir of Saragossa implored his</a>
<a id='line_2229'>      protection in the diet of Paderborn. Charlemagne undertook the</a>
<a id='line_2230'>      expedition, restored the emir, and, without distinction of faith,</a>
<a id='line_2231'>      impartially crushed the resistance of the Christians, and</a>
<a id='line_2232'>      rewarded the obedience and services of the Mahometans. In his</a>
<a id='line_2233'>      absence he instituted the Spanish march, 108 which extended from</a>
<a id='line_2234'>      the Pyrenees to the River Ebro: Barcelona was the residence of</a>
<a id='line_2235'>      the French governor: he possessed the counties of Rousillon and</a>
<a id='line_2236'>      Catalonia; and the infant kingdoms of Navarre and Arragon were</a>
<a id='line_2237'>      subject to his jurisdiction. III. As king of the Lombards, and</a>
<a id='line_2238'>      patrician of Rome, he reigned over the greatest part of Italy,</a>
<a id='line_2239'>      109 a tract of a thousand miles from the Alps to the borders of</a>
<a id='line_2240'>      Calabria. The duchy of Beneventum, a Lombard fief, had spread, at</a>
<a id='line_2241'>      the expense of the Greeks, over the modern kingdom of Naples. But</a>
<a id='line_2242'>      Arrechis, the reigning duke, refused to be included in the</a>
<a id='line_2243'>      slavery of his country; assumed the independent title of prince;</a>
<a id='line_2244'>      and opposed his sword to the Carlovingian monarchy. His defence</a>
<a id='line_2245'>      was firm, his submission was not inglorious, and the emperor was</a>
<a id='line_2246'>      content with an easy tribute, the demolition of his fortresses,</a>
<a id='line_2247'>      and the acknowledgement, on his coins, of a supreme lord. The</a>
<a id='line_2248'>      artful flattery of his son Grimoald added the appellation of</a>
<a id='line_2249'>      father, but he asserted his dignity with prudence, and Benventum</a>
<a id='line_2250'>      insensibly escaped from the French yoke. 110 IV. Charlemagne was</a>
<a id='line_2251'>      the first who united Germany under the same sceptre. The name of</a>
<a id='line_2252'>      Oriental France is preserved in the circle of Franconia; and the</a>
<a id='line_2253'>      people of Hesse and Thuringia were recently incorporated with the</a>
<a id='line_2254'>      victors, by the conformity of religion and government. The</a>
<a id='line_2255'>      Alemanni, so formidable to the Romans, were the faithful vassals</a>
<a id='line_2256'>      and confederates of the Franks; and their country was inscribed</a>
<a id='line_2257'>      within the modern limits of Alsace, Swabia, and Switzerland. The</a>
<a id='line_2258'>      Bavarians, with a similar indulgence of their laws and manners,</a>
<a id='line_2259'>      were less patient of a master: the repeated treasons of Tasillo</a>
<a id='line_2260'>      justified the abolition of their hereditary dukes; and their</a>
<a id='line_2261'>      power was shared among the counts, who judged and guarded that</a>
<a id='line_2262'>      important frontier. But the north of Germany, from the Rhine and</a>
<a id='line_2263'>      beyond the Elbe, was still hostile and Pagan; nor was it till</a>
<a id='line_2264'>      after a war of thirty-three years that the Saxons bowed under the</a>
<a id='line_2265'>      yoke of Christ and of Charlemagne. The idols and their votaries</a>
<a id='line_2266'>      were extirpated: the foundation of eight bishoprics, of Munster,</a>
<a id='line_2267'>      Osnaburgh, Paderborn, and Minden, of Bremen, Verden, Hildesheim,</a>
<a id='line_2268'>      and Halberstadt, define, on either side of the Weser, the bounds</a>
<a id='line_2269'>      of ancient Saxony these episcopal seats were the first schools</a>
<a id='line_2270'>      and cities of that savage land; and the religion and humanity of</a>
<a id='line_2271'>      the children atoned, in some degree, for the massacre of the</a>
<a id='line_2272'>      parents. Beyond the Elbe, the Slavi, or Sclavonians, of similar</a>
<a id='line_2273'>      manners and various denominations, overspread the modern</a>
<a id='line_2274'>      dominions of Prussia, Poland, and Bohemia, and some transient</a>
<a id='line_2275'>      marks of obedience have tempted the French historian to extend</a>
<a id='line_2276'>      the empire to the Baltic and the Vistula. The conquest or</a>
<a id='line_2277'>      conversion of those countries is of a more recent age; but the</a>
<a id='line_2278'>      first union of Bohemia with the Germanic body may be justly</a>
<a id='line_2279'>      ascribed to the arms of Charlemagne. V. He retaliated on the</a>
<a id='line_2280'>      Avars, or Huns of Pannonia, the same calamities which they had</a>
<a id='line_2281'>      inflicted on the nations. Their rings, the wooden fortifications</a>
<a id='line_2282'>      which encircled their districts and villages, were broken down by</a>
<a id='line_2283'>      the triple effort of a French army, that was poured into their</a>
<a id='line_2284'>      country by land and water, through the Carpathian mountains and</a>
<a id='line_2285'>      along the plain of the Danube. After a bloody conflict of eight</a>
<a id='line_2286'>      years, the loss of some French generals was avenged by the</a>
<a id='line_2287'>      slaughter of the most noble Huns: the relics of the nation</a>
<a id='line_2288'>      submitted the royal residence of the chagan was left desolate and</a>
<a id='line_2289'>      unknown; and the treasures, the rapine of two hundred and fifty</a>
<a id='line_2290'>      years, enriched the victorious troops, or decorated the churches</a>
<a id='line_2291'>      of Italy and Gaul. 111 After the reduction of Pannonia, the</a>
<a id='line_2292'>      empire of Charlemagne was bounded only by the conflux of the</a>
<a id='line_2293'>      Danube with the Teyss and the Save: the provinces of Istria,</a>
<a id='line_2294'>      Liburnia, and Dalmatia, were an easy, though unprofitable,</a>
<a id='line_2295'>      accession; and it was an effect of his moderation, that he left</a>
<a id='line_2296'>      the maritime cities under the real or nominal sovereignty of the</a>
<a id='line_2297'>      Greeks. But these distant possessions added more to the</a>
<a id='line_2298'>      reputation than to the power of the Latin emperor; nor did he</a>
<a id='line_2299'>      risk any ecclesiastical foundations to reclaim the Barbarians</a>
<a id='line_2300'>      from their vagrant life and idolatrous worship. Some canals of</a>

<a id='line_2302'>      Rhine and the Danube, were faintly attempted. 112 Their execution</a>

<a id='line_2375'>      and division of the rest of Europe. The islands of Great Britain</a>
<a id='line_2376'>      and Ireland were disputed by a crowd of princes of Saxon or</a>
<a id='line_2377'>      Scottish origin: and, after the loss of Spain, the Christian and</a>
<a id='line_2378'>      Gothic kingdom of Alphonso the Chaste was confined to the narrow</a>
<a id='line_2379'>      range of the Asturian mountains. These petty sovereigns revered</a>
<a id='line_2380'>      the power or virtue of the Carlovingian monarch, implored the</a>
<a id='line_2381'>      honor and support of his alliance, and styled him their common</a>

<a id='line_2383'>      maintained a more equal intercourse with the caliph Harun al</a>
<a id='line_2384'>      Rashid, 114 whose dominion stretched from Africa to India, and</a>
<a id='line_2385'>      accepted from his ambassadors a tent, a water-clock, an elephant,</a>
<a id='line_2386'>      and the keys of the Holy Sepulchre. It is not easy to conceive</a>
<a id='line_2387'>      the private friendship of a Frank and an Arab, who were strangers</a>
<a id='line_2388'>      to each other’s person, and language, and religion: but their</a>
<a id='line_2389'>      public correspondence was founded on vanity, and their remote</a>
<a id='line_2390'>      situation left no room for a competition of interest. Two thirds</a>
<a id='line_2391'>      of the Western empire of Rome were subject to Charlemagne, and</a>
<a id='line_2392'>      the deficiency was amply supplied by his command of the</a>
<a id='line_2393'>      inaccessible or invincible nations of Germany. But in the choice</a>
<a id='line_2394'>      of his enemies, 1141 we may be reasonably surprised that he so</a>
<a id='line_2395'>      often preferred the poverty of the north to the riches of the</a>
<a id='line_2396'>      south. The three-and-thirty campaigns laboriously consumed in the</a>
<a id='line_2397'>      woods and morasses of Germany would have sufficed to assert the</a>
<a id='line_2398'>      amplitude of his title by the expulsion of the Greeks from Italy</a>
<a id='line_2399'>      and the Saracens from Spain. The weakness of the Greeks would</a>
<a id='line_2400'>      have insured an easy victory; and the holy crusade against the</a>
<a id='line_2401'>      Saracens would have been prompted by glory and revenge, and</a>
<a id='line_2402'>      loudly justified by religion and policy. Perhaps, in his</a>
<a id='line_2403'>      expeditions beyond the Rhine and the Elbe, he aspired to save his</a>
<a id='line_2404'>      monarchy from the fate of the Roman empire, to disarm the enemies</a>
<a id='line_2405'>      of civilized society, and to eradicate the seed of future</a>

<a id='line_2478'>      male issue, the vacant throne was disputed by his uncles and</a>

<a id='line_2585'>      him in his camp, on the banks of the River Sala; and Charlemagne</a>
<a id='line_2586'>      affected to confound their vanity by displaying, in a Franconian</a>
<a id='line_2587'>      village, the pomp, or at least the pride, of the Byzantine</a>
<a id='line_2588'>      palace. 122 The Greeks were successively led through four halls</a>
<a id='line_2589'>      of audience: in the first they were ready to fall prostrate</a>
<a id='line_2590'>      before a splendid personage in a chair of state, till he informed</a>
<a id='line_2591'>      them that he was only a servant, the constable, or master of the</a>
<a id='line_2592'>      horse, of the emperor. The same mistake, and the same answer,</a>
<a id='line_2593'>      were repeated in the apartments of the count palatine, the</a>
<a id='line_2594'>      steward, and the chamberlain; and their impatience was gradually</a>
<a id='line_2595'>      heightened, till the doors of the presence-chamber were thrown</a>
<a id='line_2596'>      open, and they beheld the genuine monarch, on his throne,</a>
<a id='line_2597'>      enriched with the foreign luxury which he despised, and encircled</a>
<a id='line_2598'>      with the love and reverence of his victorious chiefs. A treaty of</a>
<a id='line_2599'>      peace and alliance was concluded between the two empires, and the</a>
<a id='line_2600'>      limits of the East and West were defined by the right of present</a>
<a id='line_2601'>      possession. But the Greeks 123 soon forgot this humiliating</a>
<a id='line_2602'>      equality, or remembered it only to hate the Barbarians by whom it</a>
<a id='line_2603'>      was extorted. During the short union of virtue and power, they</a>
<a id='line_2604'>      respectfully saluted the august Charlemagne, with the</a>
<a id='line_2605'>      acclamations of basileus, and emperor of the Romans. As soon as</a>
<a id='line_2606'>      these qualities were separated in the person of his pious son,</a>
<a id='line_2607'>      the Byzantine letters were inscribed, “To the king, or, as he</a>

<a id='line_2609'>      both power and virtue were extinct, they despoiled Lewis the</a>
<a id='line_2610'>      Second of his hereditary title, and with the barbarous</a>

<a id='line_2613'>      with some learning, that, both in sacred and profane history, the</a>

<a id='line_2669'>      and to supply the vacancy, of the bishop. Rome was divided into</a>
<a id='line_2670'>      twenty-eight parishes, and each parish was governed by a cardinal</a>
<a id='line_2671'>      priest, or presbyter, a title which, however common or modest in</a>
<a id='line_2672'>      its origin, has aspired to emulate the purple of kings. Their</a>
<a id='line_2673'>      number was enlarged by the association of the seven deacons of</a>
<a id='line_2674'>      the most considerable hospitals, the seven palatine judges of the</a>
<a id='line_2675'>      Lateran, and some dignitaries of the church. This ecclesiastical</a>
<a id='line_2676'>      senate was directed by the seven cardinal-bishops of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_2677'>      province, who were less occupied in the suburb dioceses of Ostia,</a>
<a id='line_2678'>      Porto, Velitrae, Tusculum, Praeneste, Tibur, and the Sabines,</a>
<a id='line_2679'>      than by their weekly service in the Lateran, and their superior</a>
<a id='line_2680'>      share in the honors and authority of the apostolic see. On the</a>
<a id='line_2681'>      death of the pope, these bishops recommended a successor to the</a>
<a id='line_2682'>      suffrage of the college of cardinals, 126 and their choice was</a>
<a id='line_2683'>      ratified or rejected by the applause or clamor of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_2684'>      people. But the election was imperfect; nor could the pontiff be</a>
<a id='line_2685'>      legally consecrated till the emperor, the advocate of the church,</a>
<a id='line_2686'>      had graciously signified his approbation and consent. The royal</a>
<a id='line_2687'>      commissioner examined, on the spot, the form and freedom of the</a>
<a id='line_2688'>      proceedings; nor was it till after a previous scrutiny into the</a>
<a id='line_2689'>      qualifications of the candidates, that he accepted an oath of</a>
<a id='line_2690'>      fidelity, and confirmed the donations which had successively</a>
<a id='line_2691'>      enriched the patrimony of St. Peter. In the frequent schisms, the</a>
<a id='line_2692'>      rival claims were submitted to the sentence of the emperor; and</a>
<a id='line_2693'>      in a synod of bishops he presumed to judge, to condemn, and to</a>
<a id='line_2694'>      punish, the crimes of a guilty pontiff. Otho the First imposed a</a>
<a id='line_2695'>      treaty on the senate and people, who engaged to prefer the</a>
<a id='line_2696'>      candidate most acceptable to his majesty: 127 his successors</a>
<a id='line_2697'>      anticipated or prevented their choice: they bestowed the Roman</a>
<a id='line_2698'>      benefice, like the bishoprics of Cologne or Bamberg, on their</a>
<a id='line_2699'>      chancellors or preceptors; and whatever might be the merit of a</a>
<a id='line_2700'>      Frank or Saxon, his name sufficiently attests the interposition</a>
<a id='line_2701'>      of foreign power. These acts of prerogative were most speciously</a>
<a id='line_2702'>      excused by the vices of a popular election. The competitor who</a>
<a id='line_2703'>      had been excluded by the cardinals appealed to the passions or</a>
<a id='line_2704'>      avarice of the multitude; the Vatican and the Lateran were</a>
<a id='line_2705'>      stained with blood; and the most powerful senators, the marquises</a>
<a id='line_2706'>      of Tuscany and the counts of Tusculum, held the apostolic see in</a>
<a id='line_2707'>      a long and disgraceful servitude. The Roman pontiffs, of the</a>
<a id='line_2708'>      ninth and tenth centuries, were insulted, imprisoned, and</a>
<a id='line_2709'>      murdered, by their tyrants; and such was their indigence, after</a>
<a id='line_2710'>      the loss and usurpation of the ecclesiastical patrimonies, that</a>
<a id='line_2711'>      they could neither support the state of a prince, nor exercise</a>
<a id='line_2712'>      the charity of a priest. 128 The influence of two sister</a>
<a id='line_2713'>      prostitutes, Marozia and Theodora, was founded on their wealth</a>
<a id='line_2714'>      and beauty, their political and amorous intrigues: the most</a>
<a id='line_2715'>      strenuous of their lovers were rewarded with the Roman mitre, and</a>
<a id='line_2716'>      their reign 129 may have suggested to the darker ages 130 the</a>
<a id='line_2717'>      fable 131 of a female pope. 132 The bastard son, the grandson,</a>
<a id='line_2718'>      and the great-grandson of Marozia, a rare genealogy, were seated</a>
<a id='line_2719'>      in the chair of St. Peter, and it was at the age of nineteen</a>
<a id='line_2720'>      years that the second of these became the head of the Latin</a>
<a id='line_2721'>      church. 1321 His youth and manhood were of a suitable complexion;</a>
<a id='line_2722'>      and the nations of pilgrims could bear testimony to the charges</a>
<a id='line_2723'>      that were urged against him in a Roman synod, and in the presence</a>
<a id='line_2724'>      of Otho the Great. As John XII. had renounced the dress and</a>
<a id='line_2725'>      decencies of his profession, the soldier may not perhaps be</a>
<a id='line_2726'>      dishonored by the wine which he drank, the blood that he spilt,</a>
<a id='line_2727'>      the flames that he kindled, or the licentious pursuits of gaming</a>
<a id='line_2728'>      and hunting. His open simony might be the consequence of</a>
<a id='line_2729'>      distress; and his blasphemous invocation of Jupiter and Venus, if</a>
<a id='line_2730'>      it be true, could not possibly be serious. But we read, with some</a>
<a id='line_2731'>      surprise, that the worthy grandson of Marozia lived in public</a>
<a id='line_2732'>      adultery with the matrons of Rome; that the Lateran palace was</a>
<a id='line_2733'>      turned into a school for prostitution, and that his rapes of</a>
<a id='line_2734'>      virgins and widows had deterred the female pilgrims from visiting</a>
<a id='line_2735'>      the tomb of St. Peter, lest, in the devout act, they should be</a>
<a id='line_2736'>      violated by his successor. 133 The Protestants have dwelt with</a>
<a id='line_2737'>      malicious pleasure on these characters of Antichrist; but to a</a>
<a id='line_2738'>      philosophic eye, the vices of the clergy are far less dangerous</a>
<a id='line_2739'>      than their virtues. After a long series of scandal, the apostolic</a>
<a id='line_2740'>      see was reformed and exalted by the austerity and zeal of Gregory</a>
<a id='line_2741'>      VII. That ambitious monk devoted his life to the execution of two</a>
<a id='line_2742'>      projects. I. To fix in the college of cardinals the freedom and</a>
<a id='line_2743'>      independence of election, and forever to abolish the right or</a>
<a id='line_2744'>      usurpation of the emperors and the Roman people. II. To bestow</a>
<a id='line_2745'>      and resume the Western empire as a fief or benefice 134 of the</a>
<a id='line_2746'>      church, and to extend his temporal dominion over the kings and</a>
<a id='line_2747'>      kingdoms of the earth. After a contest of fifty years, the first</a>
<a id='line_2748'>      of these designs was accomplished by the firm support of the</a>
<a id='line_2749'>      ecclesiastical order, whose liberty was connected with that of</a>
<a id='line_2750'>      their chief. But the second attempt, though it was crowned with</a>

<a id='line_2866'>      chastised with a blow by his new father. The blow was productive</a>
<a id='line_2867'>      of a revolution. “Romans,” exclaimed the youth, “once you were</a>

<a id='line_2880'>      provoked by the Lombard princes to seek a deliverer for the</a>

<a id='line_2892'>      process was justified by the ancient laws of Theodosius and</a>
<a id='line_2893'>      Justinian. The voice of fame has accused the second Otho of a</a>

<a id='line_3149'>      violence, was ratified by favor or distress, was granted as the</a>
<a id='line_3150'>      price of a doubtful vote or a voluntary service; whatever had</a>
<a id='line_3151'>      been granted to one could not, without injury, be denied to his</a>
<a id='line_3152'>      successor or equal; and every act of local or temporary</a>
<a id='line_3153'>      possession was insensibly moulded into the constitution of the</a>
<a id='line_3154'>      Germanic kingdom. In every province, the visible presence of the</a>
<a id='line_3155'>      duke or count was interposed between the throne and the nobles;</a>
<a id='line_3156'>      the subjects of the law became the vassals of a private chief;</a>
<a id='line_3157'>      and the standard which he received from his sovereign, was often</a>
<a id='line_3158'>      raised against him in the field. The temporal power of the clergy</a>
<a id='line_3159'>      was cherished and exalted by the superstition or policy of the</a>
<a id='line_3160'>      Carlovingian and Saxon dynasties, who blindly depended on their</a>
<a id='line_3161'>      moderation and fidelity; and the bishoprics of Germany were made</a>
<a id='line_3162'>      equal in extent and privilege, superior in wealth and population,</a>
<a id='line_3163'>      to the most ample states of the military order. As long as the</a>
<a id='line_3164'>      emperors retained the prerogative of bestowing on every vacancy</a>
<a id='line_3165'>      these ecclesiastic and secular benefices, their cause was</a>
<a id='line_3166'>      maintained by the gratitude or ambition of their friends and</a>
<a id='line_3167'>      favorites. But in the quarrel of the investitures, they were</a>
<a id='line_3168'>      deprived of their influence over the episcopal chapters; the</a>
<a id='line_3169'>      freedom of election was restored, and the sovereign was reduced,</a>
<a id='line_3170'>      by a solemn mockery, to his first prayers, the recommendation,</a>
<a id='line_3171'>      once in his reign, to a single prebend in each church. The</a>
<a id='line_3172'>      secular governors, instead of being recalled at the will of a</a>
<a id='line_3173'>      superior, could be degraded only by the sentence of their peers.</a>
<a id='line_3174'>      In the first age of the monarchy, the appointment of the son to</a>
<a id='line_3175'>      the duchy or county of his father, was solicited as a favor; it</a>
<a id='line_3176'>      was gradually obtained as a custom, and extorted as a right: the</a>
<a id='line_3177'>      lineal succession was often extended to the collateral or female</a>
<a id='line_3178'>      branches; the states of the empire (their popular, and at length</a>
<a id='line_3179'>      their legal, appellation) were divided and alienated by testament</a>
<a id='line_3180'>      and sale; and all idea of a public trust was lost in that of a</a>
<a id='line_3181'>      private and perpetual inheritance. The emperor could not even be</a>
<a id='line_3182'>      enriched by the casualties of forfeiture and extinction: within</a>
<a id='line_3183'>      the term of a year, he was obliged to dispose of the vacant fief;</a>
<a id='line_3184'>      and, in the choice of the candidate, it was his duty to consult</a>
<a id='line_3185'>      either the general or the provincial diet.</a>
<a id='line_3186'></a>
<a id='line_3187'>      After the death of Frederic the Second, Germany was left a</a>
<a id='line_3188'>      monster with a hundred heads. A crowd of princes and prelates</a>
<a id='line_3189'>      disputed the ruins of the empire: the lords of innumerable</a>
<a id='line_3190'>      castles were less prone to obey, than to imitate, their</a>
<a id='line_3191'>      superiors; and, according to the measure of their strength, their</a>
<a id='line_3192'>      incessant hostilities received the names of conquest or robbery.</a>
<a id='line_3193'>      Such anarchy was the inevitable consequence of the laws and</a>
<a id='line_3194'>      manners of Europe; and the kingdoms of France and Italy were</a>
<a id='line_3195'>      shivered into fragments by the violence of the same tempest. But</a>
<a id='line_3196'>      the Italian cities and the French vassals were divided and</a>
<a id='line_3197'>      destroyed, while the union of the Germans has produced, under the</a>
<a id='line_3198'>      name of an empire, a great system of a federative republic. In</a>
<a id='line_3199'>      the frequent and at last the perpetual institution of diets, a</a>
<a id='line_3200'>      national spirit was kept alive, and the powers of a common</a>
<a id='line_3201'>      legislature are still exercised by the three branches or colleges</a>
<a id='line_3202'>      of the electors, the princes, and the free and Imperial cities of</a>
<a id='line_3203'>      Germany. I. Seven of the most powerful feudatories were permitted</a>
<a id='line_3204'>      to assume, with a distinguished name and rank, the exclusive</a>

<a id='line_3208'>      archbishops of Mentz, of Treves, and of Cologne. II. The college</a>
<a id='line_3209'>      of princes and prelates purged themselves of a promiscuous</a>
<a id='line_3210'>      multitude: they reduced to four representative votes the long</a>
<a id='line_3211'>      series of independent counts, and excluded the nobles or</a>

<a id='line_3251'>      which no longer held, except on the borders of the Rhine and</a>

<a id='line_3253'>      unworthy successors were the counts of Hapsburgh, of Nassau, of</a>
<a id='line_3254'>      Luxemburgh, and Schwartzenburgh: the emperor Henry the Seventh</a>

<a id='line_3256'>      Charles the Fourth was born among a people strange and barbarous</a>
<a id='line_3257'>      in the estimation of the Germans themselves. 150 After the</a>
<a id='line_3258'>      excommunication of Lewis of Bavaria, he received the gift or</a>
<a id='line_3259'>      promise of the vacant empire from the Roman pontiffs, who, in the</a>
<a id='line_3260'>      exile and captivity of Avignon, affected the dominion of the</a>
<a id='line_3261'>      earth. The death of his competitors united the electoral college,</a>
<a id='line_3262'>      and Charles was unanimously saluted king of the Romans, and</a>
<a id='line_3263'>      future emperor; a title which, in the same age, was prostituted</a>
<a id='line_3264'>      to the Caesars of Germany and Greece. The German emperor was no</a>
<a id='line_3265'>      more than the elective and impotent magistrate of an aristocracy</a>
<a id='line_3266'>      of princes, who had not left him a village that he might call his</a>
<a id='line_3267'>      own. His best prerogative was the right of presiding and</a>
<a id='line_3268'>      proposing in the national senate, which was convened at his</a>
<a id='line_3269'>      summons; and his native kingdom of Bohemia, less opulent than the</a>
<a id='line_3270'>      adjacent city of Nuremberg, was the firmest seat of his power and</a>
<a id='line_3271'>      the richest source of his revenue. The army with which he passed</a>
<a id='line_3272'>      the Alps consisted of three hundred horse. In the cathedral of</a>
<a id='line_3273'>      St. Ambrose, Charles was crowned with the iron crown, which</a>
<a id='line_3274'>      tradition ascribed to the Lombard monarchy; but he was admitted</a>
<a id='line_3275'>      only with a peaceful train; the gates of the city were shut upon</a>
<a id='line_3276'>      him; and the king of Italy was held a captive by the arms of the</a>
<a id='line_3277'>      Visconti, whom he confirmed in the sovereignty of Milan. In the</a>

<a id='line_3307'>      style of a sovereign and legislator. A hundred princes bowed</a>
<a id='line_3308'>      before his throne, and exalted their own dignity by the voluntary</a>
<a id='line_3309'>      honors which they yielded to their chief or minister. At the</a>
<a id='line_3310'>      royal banquet, the hereditary great officers, the seven electors,</a>
<a id='line_3311'>      who in rank and title were equal to kings, performed their solemn</a>
<a id='line_3312'>      and domestic service of the palace. The seals of the triple</a>
<a id='line_3313'>      kingdom were borne in state by the archbishops of Mentz, Cologne,</a>
<a id='line_3314'>      and Treves, the perpetual arch-chancellors of Germany, Italy, and</a>
<a id='line_3315'>      Arles. The great marshal, on horseback, exercised his function</a>

<a id='line_3321'>      basin, to wash. The king of Bohemia, as great cup-bearer, was</a>
<a id='line_3322'>      represented by the emperor’s brother, the duke of Luxemburgh and</a>
<a id='line_3323'>      Brabant; and the procession was closed by the great huntsmen, who</a>
<a id='line_3324'>      introduced a boar and a stag, with a loud chorus of horns and</a>
<a id='line_3325'>      hounds. 152 Nor was the supremacy of the emperor confined to</a>
<a id='line_3326'>      Germany alone: the hereditary monarchs of Europe confessed the</a>
