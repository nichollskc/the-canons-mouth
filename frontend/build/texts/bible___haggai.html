<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the</a>
<a id='line_4'>first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the</a>
<a id='line_5'>prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and</a>
<a id='line_6'>to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying, 1:2 Thus</a>
<a id='line_7'>speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The time is not</a>
<a id='line_8'>come, the time that the LORD’s house should be built.</a>
<a id='line_9'></a>
<a id='line_10'>1:3 Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying, 1:4</a>
<a id='line_11'>Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and this</a>
<a id='line_12'>house lie waste?  1:5 Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts;</a>
<a id='line_13'>Consider your ways.</a>
<a id='line_14'></a>
<a id='line_15'>1:6 Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have not</a>
<a id='line_16'>enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye clothe you, but</a>
<a id='line_17'>there is none warm; and he that earneth wages earneth wages to put it</a>
<a id='line_18'>into a bag with holes.</a>
<a id='line_19'></a>
<a id='line_20'>1:7 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>1:8 Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house; and I</a>
<a id='line_23'>will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'>1:9 Ye looked for much, and, lo it came to little; and when ye brought</a>
<a id='line_26'>it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of hosts. Because of</a>
<a id='line_27'>mine house that is waste, and ye run every man unto his own house.</a>
<a id='line_28'></a>
<a id='line_29'>1:10 Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the earth</a>
<a id='line_30'>is stayed from her fruit.</a>
<a id='line_31'></a>
<a id='line_32'>1:11 And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains,</a>
<a id='line_33'>and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon</a>
<a id='line_34'>that which the ground bringeth forth, and upon men, and upon cattle,</a>
<a id='line_35'>and upon all the labour of the hands.</a>
<a id='line_36'></a>
<a id='line_37'>1:12 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of</a>
<a id='line_38'>Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed</a>
<a id='line_39'>the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet,</a>
<a id='line_40'>as the LORD their God had sent him, and the people did fear before the</a>
<a id='line_41'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>1:13 Then spake Haggai the LORD’s messenger in the LORD’s message unto</a>
<a id='line_44'>the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_45'></a>
<a id='line_46'>1:14 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of</a>
<a id='line_47'>Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of</a>
<a id='line_48'>Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the</a>
<a id='line_49'>people; and they came and did work in the house of the LORD of hosts,</a>
<a id='line_50'>their God, 1:15 In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in</a>
<a id='line_51'>the second year of Darius the king.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>2:1 In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the month,</a>
<a id='line_54'>came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai, saying, 2:2 Speak now</a>
<a id='line_55'>to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua</a>
<a id='line_56'>the son of Josedech, the high priest, and to the residue of the</a>
<a id='line_57'>people, saying, 2:3 Who is left among you that saw this house in her</a>
<a id='line_58'>first glory? and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in</a>
<a id='line_59'>comparison of it as nothing?  2:4 Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel,</a>
<a id='line_60'>saith the LORD; and be strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high</a>
<a id='line_61'>priest; and be strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_62'>work: for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts: 2:5 According to the</a>
<a id='line_63'>word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, so my</a>
<a id='line_64'>spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.</a>
<a id='line_65'></a>
<a id='line_66'>2:6 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little while,</a>
<a id='line_67'>and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry</a>
<a id='line_68'>land; 2:7 And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations</a>
<a id='line_69'>shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the LORD of</a>
<a id='line_70'>hosts.</a>
<a id='line_71'></a>
<a id='line_72'>2:8 The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_73'></a>
<a id='line_74'>2:9 The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the</a>
<a id='line_75'>former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give peace,</a>
<a id='line_76'>saith the LORD of hosts.</a>
<a id='line_77'></a>
<a id='line_78'>2:10 In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second</a>
<a id='line_79'>year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet,</a>
<a id='line_80'>saying, 2:11 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests</a>
<a id='line_81'>concerning the law, saying, 2:12 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt</a>
<a id='line_82'>of his garment, and with his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or</a>
<a id='line_83'>wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered</a>
<a id='line_84'>and said, No.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>2:13 Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any</a>
<a id='line_87'>of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It</a>
<a id='line_88'>shall be unclean.</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>2:14 Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is this</a>
<a id='line_91'>nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of their hands;</a>
<a id='line_92'>and that which they offer there is unclean.</a>
<a id='line_93'></a>
<a id='line_94'>2:15 And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from</a>
<a id='line_95'>before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the LORD: 2:16</a>
<a id='line_96'>Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty measures,</a>
<a id='line_97'>there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat for to draw out</a>
<a id='line_98'>fifty vessels out of the press, there were but twenty.</a>
<a id='line_99'></a>
<a id='line_100'>2:17 I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all</a>
<a id='line_101'>the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_102'></a>
<a id='line_103'>2:18 Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and</a>
<a id='line_104'>twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the</a>
<a id='line_105'>foundation of the LORD’s temple was laid, consider it.</a>
<a id='line_106'></a>
<a id='line_107'>2:19 Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig</a>
<a id='line_108'>tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not brought forth:</a>
<a id='line_109'>from this day will I bless you.</a>
<a id='line_110'></a>
<a id='line_111'>2:20 And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four and</a>
<a id='line_112'>twentieth day of the month, saying, 2:21 Speak to Zerubbabel, governor</a>
<a id='line_113'>of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth; 2:22 And I</a>
<a id='line_114'>will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength</a>
<a id='line_115'>of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I will overthrow the chariots, and</a>
<a id='line_116'>those that ride in them; and the horses and their riders shall come</a>
<a id='line_117'>down, every one by the sword of his brother.</a>
<a id='line_118'></a>
<a id='line_119'>2:23 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O</a>
<a id='line_120'>Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD, and will</a>
<a id='line_121'>make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith the LORD of hosts.</a>
