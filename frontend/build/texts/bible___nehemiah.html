                    <a id='line_0'>The Book of Nehemiah</a>
<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass</a>
<a id='line_4'>in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the</a>
<a id='line_5'>palace, 1:2 That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men</a>
<a id='line_6'>of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which</a>
<a id='line_7'>were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>1:3 And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity</a>
<a id='line_10'>there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall</a>
<a id='line_11'>of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned</a>
<a id='line_12'>with fire.</a>
<a id='line_13'></a>
<a id='line_14'>1:4 And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and</a>
<a id='line_15'>wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God</a>
<a id='line_16'>of heaven, 1:5 And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the</a>
<a id='line_17'>great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that</a>
<a id='line_18'>love him and observe his commandments: 1:6 Let thine ear now be</a>
<a id='line_19'>attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hear the prayer of</a>
<a id='line_20'>thy servant, which I pray before thee now, day and night, for the</a>
<a id='line_21'>children of Israel thy servants, and confess the sins of the children</a>
<a id='line_22'>of Israel, which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father’s</a>
<a id='line_23'>house have sinned.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'>1:7 We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the</a>
<a id='line_26'>commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which thou</a>
<a id='line_27'>commandedst thy servant Moses.</a>
<a id='line_28'></a>
<a id='line_29'>1:8 Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy</a>
<a id='line_30'>servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you abroad</a>
<a id='line_31'>among the nations: 1:9 But if ye turn unto me, and keep my</a>
<a id='line_32'>commandments, and do them; though there were of you cast out unto the</a>
<a id='line_33'>uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and</a>
<a id='line_34'>will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name</a>
<a id='line_35'>there.</a>
<a id='line_36'></a>
<a id='line_37'>1:10 Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast</a>
<a id='line_38'>redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.</a>
<a id='line_39'></a>
<a id='line_40'>1:11 O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the</a>
<a id='line_41'>prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who desire</a>
<a id='line_42'>to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and</a>
<a id='line_43'>grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king’s</a>
<a id='line_44'>cupbearer.</a>
<a id='line_45'></a>
<a id='line_46'>2:1 And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of</a>
<a id='line_47'>Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took up the wine,</a>
<a id='line_48'>and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been beforetime sad in his</a>
<a id='line_49'>presence.</a>
<a id='line_50'></a>
<a id='line_51'>2:2 Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad,</a>
<a id='line_52'>seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart.</a>
<a id='line_53'>Then I was very sore afraid, 2:3 And said unto the king, Let the king</a>
<a id='line_54'>live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city,</a>
<a id='line_55'>the place of my fathers’ sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates</a>
<a id='line_56'>thereof are consumed with fire?  2:4 Then the king said unto me, For</a>
<a id='line_57'>what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_58'></a>
<a id='line_59'>2:5 And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy</a>
<a id='line_60'>servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me</a>
<a id='line_61'>unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers’ sepulchres, that I may build</a>
<a id='line_62'>it.</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>2:6 And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,) For</a>
<a id='line_65'>how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it</a>
<a id='line_66'>pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</a>
<a id='line_67'></a>
<a id='line_68'>2:7 Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters</a>
<a id='line_69'>be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me</a>
<a id='line_70'>over till I come into Judah; 2:8 And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of</a>
<a id='line_71'>the king’s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the</a>
<a id='line_72'>gates of the palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall</a>
<a id='line_73'>of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king</a>
<a id='line_74'>granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>2:9 Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them the</a>
<a id='line_77'>king’s letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army and</a>
<a id='line_78'>horsemen with me.</a>
<a id='line_79'></a>
<a id='line_80'>2:10 When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the</a>
<a id='line_81'>Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come</a>
<a id='line_82'>a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>2:11 So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>2:12 And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither</a>
<a id='line_87'>told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem:</a>
<a id='line_88'>neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>2:13 And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before</a>
<a id='line_91'>the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of</a>
<a id='line_92'>Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed</a>
<a id='line_93'>with fire.</a>
<a id='line_94'></a>
<a id='line_95'>2:14 Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king’s</a>
<a id='line_96'>pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.</a>
<a id='line_97'></a>
<a id='line_98'>2:15 Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall,</a>
<a id='line_99'>and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so</a>
<a id='line_100'>returned.</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>2:16 And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither</a>
<a id='line_103'>had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the</a>
<a id='line_104'>nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>2:17 Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how</a>
<a id='line_107'>Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire:</a>
<a id='line_108'>come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a</a>
<a id='line_109'>reproach.</a>
<a id='line_110'></a>
<a id='line_111'>2:18 Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me; as</a>
<a id='line_112'>also the king’s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let</a>
<a id='line_113'>us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for this good</a>
<a id='line_114'>work.</a>
<a id='line_115'></a>
<a id='line_116'>2:19 But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the</a>
<a id='line_117'>Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn,</a>
<a id='line_118'>and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye</a>
<a id='line_119'>rebel against the king?  2:20 Then answered I them, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_120'>them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants</a>
<a id='line_121'>will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial,</a>
<a id='line_122'>in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_123'></a>
<a id='line_124'>3:1 Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the</a>
<a id='line_125'>priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set</a>
<a id='line_126'>up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it,</a>
<a id='line_127'>unto the tower of Hananeel.</a>
<a id='line_128'></a>
<a id='line_129'>3:2 And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them</a>
<a id='line_130'>builded Zaccur the son of Imri.</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'>3:3 But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid</a>
<a id='line_133'>the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof,</a>
<a id='line_134'>and the bars thereof.</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>3:4 And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of</a>
<a id='line_137'>Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the</a>
<a id='line_138'>son of Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of</a>
<a id='line_139'>Baana.</a>
<a id='line_140'></a>
<a id='line_141'>3:5 And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not</a>
<a id='line_142'>their necks to the work of their LORD.</a>
<a id='line_143'></a>
<a id='line_144'>3:6 Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and</a>
<a id='line_145'>Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set</a>
<a id='line_146'>up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>3:7 And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the</a>
<a id='line_149'>Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the throne of the</a>
<a id='line_150'>governor on this side the river.</a>
<a id='line_151'></a>
<a id='line_152'>3:8 Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the</a>
<a id='line_153'>goldsmiths.</a>
<a id='line_154'></a>
<a id='line_155'>Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the</a>
<a id='line_156'>apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall.</a>
<a id='line_157'></a>
<a id='line_158'>3:9 And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of</a>
<a id='line_159'>the half part of Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_160'></a>
<a id='line_161'>3:10 And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even</a>
<a id='line_162'>over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of</a>
<a id='line_163'>Hashabniah.</a>
<a id='line_164'></a>
<a id='line_165'>3:11 Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab,</a>
<a id='line_166'>repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces.</a>
<a id='line_167'></a>
<a id='line_168'>3:12 And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the ruler</a>
<a id='line_169'>of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.</a>
<a id='line_170'></a>
<a id='line_171'>3:13 The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah;</a>
<a id='line_172'>they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and</a>
<a id='line_173'>the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung</a>
<a id='line_174'>gate.</a>
<a id='line_175'></a>
<a id='line_176'>3:14 But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the ruler</a>
<a id='line_177'>of part of Bethhaccerem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof,</a>
<a id='line_178'>the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.</a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>3:15 But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of</a>
<a id='line_181'>Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it,</a>
<a id='line_182'>and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof,</a>
<a id='line_183'>and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king’s garden, and unto the</a>
<a id='line_184'>stairs that go down from the city of David.</a>
<a id='line_185'></a>
<a id='line_186'>3:16 After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the</a>
<a id='line_187'>half part of Bethzur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of</a>
<a id='line_188'>David, and to the pool that was made, and unto the house of the</a>
<a id='line_189'>mighty.</a>
<a id='line_190'></a>
<a id='line_191'>3:17 After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto</a>
<a id='line_192'>him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of Keilah, in his</a>
<a id='line_193'>part.</a>
<a id='line_194'></a>
<a id='line_195'>3:18 After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad, the</a>
<a id='line_196'>ruler of the half part of Keilah.</a>
<a id='line_197'></a>
<a id='line_198'>3:19 And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of</a>
<a id='line_199'>Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armoury at the</a>
<a id='line_200'>turning of the wall.</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>3:20 After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the other</a>
<a id='line_203'>piece, from the turning of the wall unto the door of the house of</a>
<a id='line_204'>Eliashib the high priest.</a>
<a id='line_205'></a>
<a id='line_206'>3:21 After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz</a>

<a id='line_208'>of the house of Eliashib.</a>
<a id='line_209'></a>
<a id='line_210'>3:22 And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain.</a>
<a id='line_211'></a>
<a id='line_212'>3:23 After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their house.</a>
<a id='line_213'></a>
<a id='line_214'>After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah by</a>
<a id='line_215'>his house.</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>3:24 After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from</a>
<a id='line_218'>the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall, even unto the</a>
<a id='line_219'>corner.</a>

<a id='line_221'>3:25 Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall, and</a>
<a id='line_222'>the tower which lieth out from the king’s high house, that was by the</a>
<a id='line_223'>court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh.</a>
<a id='line_224'></a>
<a id='line_225'>3:26 Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over</a>
<a id='line_226'>against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lieth out.</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>3:27 After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the</a>
<a id='line_229'>great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel.</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>3:28 From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over</a>
<a id='line_232'>against his house.</a>
<a id='line_233'></a>
<a id='line_234'>3:29 After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his</a>
<a id='line_235'>house.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah, the keeper of</a>
<a id='line_238'>the east gate.</a>
<a id='line_239'></a>
<a id='line_240'>3:30 After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the</a>
<a id='line_241'>sixth son of Zalaph, another piece. After him repaired Meshullam the</a>
<a id='line_242'>son of Berechiah over against his chamber.</a>
<a id='line_243'></a>
<a id='line_244'>3:31 After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith’s son unto the place of</a>
<a id='line_245'>the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad,</a>
<a id='line_246'>and to the going up of the corner.</a>
<a id='line_247'></a>
<a id='line_248'>3:32 And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate</a>
<a id='line_249'>repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.</a>
<a id='line_250'></a>
<a id='line_251'>4:1 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded the</a>
<a id='line_252'>wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.</a>
<a id='line_253'></a>
<a id='line_254'>4:2 And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and</a>
<a id='line_255'>said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves? will</a>
<a id='line_256'>they sacrifice?  will they make an end in a day? will they revive the</a>
<a id='line_257'>stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?  4:3 Now</a>
<a id='line_258'>Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they</a>
<a id='line_259'>build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.</a>
<a id='line_260'></a>
<a id='line_261'>4:4 Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach upon</a>
<a id='line_262'>their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of captivity: 4:5</a>
<a id='line_263'>And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out</a>
<a id='line_264'>from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger before the</a>
<a id='line_265'>builders.</a>
<a id='line_266'></a>
<a id='line_267'>4:6 So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto</a>
<a id='line_268'>the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.</a>
<a id='line_269'></a>
<a id='line_270'>4:7 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the</a>
<a id='line_271'>Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls</a>
<a id='line_272'>of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped,</a>
<a id='line_273'>then they were very wroth, 4:8 And conspired all of them together to</a>
<a id='line_274'>come and to fight against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.</a>
<a id='line_275'></a>
<a id='line_276'>4:9 Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch</a>
<a id='line_277'>against them day and night, because of them.</a>
<a id='line_278'></a>
<a id='line_279'>4:10 And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is</a>
<a id='line_280'>decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build</a>
<a id='line_281'>the wall.</a>
<a id='line_282'></a>
<a id='line_283'>4:11 And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till</a>
<a id='line_284'>we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause the work to</a>
<a id='line_285'>cease.</a>
<a id='line_286'></a>
<a id='line_287'>4:12 And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them came,</a>
<a id='line_288'>they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye shall return</a>
<a id='line_289'>unto us they will be upon you.</a>
<a id='line_290'></a>
<a id='line_291'>4:13 Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the</a>
<a id='line_292'>higher places, I even set the people after their families with their</a>
<a id='line_293'>swords, their spears, and their bows.</a>
<a id='line_294'></a>
<a id='line_295'>4:14 And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the</a>
<a id='line_296'>rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them:</a>
<a id='line_297'>remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and fight for your</a>
<a id='line_298'>brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</a>
<a id='line_299'></a>
<a id='line_300'>4:15 And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known</a>
<a id='line_301'>unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned</a>
<a id='line_302'>all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.</a>
<a id='line_303'></a>
<a id='line_304'>4:16 And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my</a>
<a id='line_305'>servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held both the</a>
<a id='line_306'>spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers</a>
<a id='line_307'>were behind all the house of Judah.</a>
<a id='line_308'></a>
<a id='line_309'>4:17 They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens, with</a>
<a id='line_310'>those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought in the work,</a>
<a id='line_311'>and with the other hand held a weapon.</a>
<a id='line_312'></a>
<a id='line_313'>4:18 For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and</a>
<a id='line_314'>so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.</a>
<a id='line_315'></a>
<a id='line_316'>4:19 And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of</a>
<a id='line_317'>the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the</a>
<a id='line_318'>wall, one far from another.</a>
<a id='line_319'></a>
<a id='line_320'>4:20 In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort</a>
<a id='line_321'>ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.</a>
<a id='line_322'></a>
<a id='line_323'>4:21 So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears from</a>
<a id='line_324'>the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.</a>
<a id='line_325'></a>
<a id='line_326'>4:22 Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one</a>
<a id='line_327'>with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be</a>
<a id='line_328'>a guard to us, and labour on the day.</a>
<a id='line_329'></a>
<a id='line_330'>4:23 So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of</a>
<a id='line_331'>the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving</a>
<a id='line_332'>that every one put them off for washing.</a>
<a id='line_333'></a>
<a id='line_334'>5:1 And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against</a>
<a id='line_335'>their brethren the Jews.</a>
<a id='line_336'></a>
<a id='line_337'>5:2 For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are</a>
<a id='line_338'>many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and live.</a>
<a id='line_339'></a>
<a id='line_340'>5:3 Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands,</a>
<a id='line_341'>vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the dearth.</a>
<a id='line_342'></a>
<a id='line_343'>5:4 There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king’s</a>
<a id='line_344'>tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.</a>
<a id='line_345'></a>
<a id='line_346'>5:5 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as</a>
<a id='line_347'>their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our</a>
<a id='line_348'>daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought unto</a>
<a id='line_349'>bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other</a>
<a id='line_350'>men have our lands and vineyards.</a>
<a id='line_351'></a>
<a id='line_352'>5:6 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</a>
<a id='line_353'></a>
<a id='line_354'>5:7 Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and the</a>
<a id='line_355'>rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother.</a>
<a id='line_356'>And I set a great assembly against them.</a>
<a id='line_357'></a>
<a id='line_358'>5:8 And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our</a>
<a id='line_359'>brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will ye even</a>
<a id='line_360'>sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us? Then held they</a>
<a id='line_361'>their peace, and found nothing to answer.</a>
<a id='line_362'></a>
<a id='line_363'>5:9 Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk in</a>
<a id='line_364'>the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen our</a>
<a id='line_365'>enemies?  5:10 I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might</a>
<a id='line_366'>exact of them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</a>
<a id='line_367'></a>
<a id='line_368'>5:11 Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands, their</a>
<a id='line_369'>vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part</a>
<a id='line_370'>of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and the oil, that ye exact of</a>
<a id='line_371'>them.</a>
<a id='line_372'></a>
<a id='line_373'>5:12 Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of</a>
<a id='line_374'>them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and</a>
<a id='line_375'>took an oath of them, that they should do according to this promise.</a>
<a id='line_376'></a>
<a id='line_377'>5:13 Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from</a>
<a id='line_378'>his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this promise, even</a>
<a id='line_379'>thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the congregation said,</a>
<a id='line_380'>Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people did according to this</a>
<a id='line_381'>promise.</a>
<a id='line_382'></a>
<a id='line_383'>5:14 Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor</a>
<a id='line_384'>in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and</a>
<a id='line_385'>thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that is, twelve years, I and my</a>
<a id='line_386'>brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.</a>
<a id='line_387'></a>
<a id='line_388'>5:15 But the former governors that had been before me were chargeable</a>
<a id='line_389'>unto the people, and had taken of them bread and wine, beside forty</a>
<a id='line_390'>shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people:</a>
<a id='line_391'>but so did not I, because of the fear of God.</a>
<a id='line_392'></a>
<a id='line_393'>5:16 Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we</a>
<a id='line_394'>any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.</a>
<a id='line_395'></a>
<a id='line_396'>5:17 Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the Jews</a>
<a id='line_397'>and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the heathen that</a>
<a id='line_398'>are about us.</a>
<a id='line_399'></a>
<a id='line_400'>5:18 Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six</a>
<a id='line_401'>choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days</a>
<a id='line_402'>store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not I the bread</a>
<a id='line_403'>of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</a>
<a id='line_404'></a>
<a id='line_405'>5:19 Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have</a>
<a id='line_406'>done for this people.</a>
<a id='line_407'></a>
<a id='line_408'>6:1 Now it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the</a>
<a id='line_409'>Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded the</a>
<a id='line_410'>wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though at that time</a>
<a id='line_411'>I had not set up the doors upon the gates;) 6:2 That Sanballat and</a>
<a id='line_412'>Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in some one of</a>
<a id='line_413'>the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</a>
<a id='line_414'></a>
<a id='line_415'>6:3 And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work,</a>
<a id='line_416'>so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave</a>
<a id='line_417'>it, and come down to you?  6:4 Yet they sent unto me four times after</a>
<a id='line_418'>this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</a>
<a id='line_419'></a>
<a id='line_420'>6:5 Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth</a>
<a id='line_421'>time with an open letter in his hand; 6:6 Wherein was written, It is</a>
<a id='line_422'>reported among the heathen, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the</a>
<a id='line_423'>Jews think to rebel: for which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou</a>
<a id='line_424'>mayest be their king, according to these words.</a>
<a id='line_425'></a>
<a id='line_426'>6:7 And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at</a>
<a id='line_427'>Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be</a>
<a id='line_428'>reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and</a>
<a id='line_429'>let us take counsel together.</a>
<a id='line_430'></a>
<a id='line_431'>6:8 Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as</a>
<a id='line_432'>thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</a>
<a id='line_433'></a>
<a id='line_434'>6:9 For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened</a>
<a id='line_435'>from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, strengthen</a>
<a id='line_436'>my hands.</a>
<a id='line_437'></a>
<a id='line_438'>6:10 Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah</a>
<a id='line_439'>the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet</a>
<a id='line_440'>together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the</a>
<a id='line_441'>doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the</a>
<a id='line_442'>night will they come to slay thee.</a>
<a id='line_443'></a>
<a id='line_444'>6:11 And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that,</a>
<a id='line_445'>being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not</a>
<a id='line_446'>go in.</a>
<a id='line_447'></a>
<a id='line_448'>6:12 And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he</a>
<a id='line_449'>pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had</a>
<a id='line_450'>hired him.</a>
<a id='line_451'></a>
<a id='line_452'>6:13 Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and</a>
<a id='line_453'>sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they</a>
<a id='line_454'>might reproach me.</a>
<a id='line_455'></a>
<a id='line_456'>6:14 My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to these</a>
<a id='line_457'>their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the</a>
<a id='line_458'>prophets, that would have put me in fear.</a>
<a id='line_459'></a>
<a id='line_460'>6:15 So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month</a>
<a id='line_461'>Elul, in fifty and two days.</a>
<a id='line_462'></a>
<a id='line_463'>6:16 And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof, and</a>
<a id='line_464'>all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they were much</a>
<a id='line_465'>cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that this work was</a>
<a id='line_466'>wrought of our God.</a>
<a id='line_467'></a>
<a id='line_468'>6:17 Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto</a>
<a id='line_469'>Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.</a>
<a id='line_470'></a>
<a id='line_471'>6:18 For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the</a>
<a id='line_472'>son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son Johanan had</a>
<a id='line_473'>taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.</a>
<a id='line_474'></a>
<a id='line_475'>6:19 Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words</a>
<a id='line_476'>to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</a>
<a id='line_477'></a>
<a id='line_478'>7:1 Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the</a>
<a id='line_479'>doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</a>
<a id='line_480'>7:2 That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the</a>
<a id='line_481'>palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and feared</a>
<a id='line_482'>God above many.</a>
<a id='line_483'></a>
<a id='line_484'>7:3 And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened</a>
<a id='line_485'>until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the</a>
<a id='line_486'>doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of</a>
<a id='line_487'>Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against</a>
<a id='line_488'>his house.</a>
<a id='line_489'></a>
<a id='line_490'>7:4 Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein,</a>
<a id='line_491'>and the houses were not builded.</a>
<a id='line_492'></a>
<a id='line_493'>7:5 And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and</a>
<a id='line_494'>the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy.</a>
<a id='line_495'>And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the</a>
<a id='line_496'>first, and found written therein, 7:6 These are the children of the</a>
<a id='line_497'>province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been</a>
<a id='line_498'>carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried</a>
<a id='line_499'>away, and came again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his</a>
<a id='line_500'>city; 7:7 Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah,</a>
<a id='line_501'>Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum,</a>
<a id='line_502'>Baanah. The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was</a>
<a id='line_503'>this; 7:8 The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and</a>
<a id='line_504'>two.</a>

<a id='line_633'>and seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and</a>
<a id='line_634'>singing women.</a>
<a id='line_635'></a>
<a id='line_636'>7:68 Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two</a>
<a id='line_637'>hundred forty and five: 7:69 Their camels, four hundred thirty and</a>
<a id='line_638'>five: six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses.</a>
<a id='line_639'></a>
<a id='line_640'>7:70 And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The</a>
<a id='line_641'>Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basons,</a>
<a id='line_642'>five hundred and thirty priests’ garments.</a>
<a id='line_643'></a>
<a id='line_644'>7:71 And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the</a>
<a id='line_645'>work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred</a>
<a id='line_646'>pound of silver.</a>
<a id='line_647'></a>
<a id='line_648'>7:72 And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand</a>
<a id='line_649'>drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and threescore and</a>
<a id='line_650'>seven priests’ garments.</a>
<a id='line_651'></a>
<a id='line_652'>7:73 So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the</a>
<a id='line_653'>singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all Israel,</a>
<a id='line_654'>dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children</a>
<a id='line_655'>of Israel were in their cities.</a>
<a id='line_656'></a>
<a id='line_657'>8:1 And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into</a>
<a id='line_658'>the street that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra</a>
<a id='line_659'>the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had</a>
<a id='line_660'>commanded to Israel.</a>
<a id='line_661'></a>
<a id='line_662'>8:2 And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both</a>
<a id='line_663'>of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the</a>
<a id='line_664'>first day of the seventh month.</a>
<a id='line_665'></a>
<a id='line_666'>8:3 And he read therein before the street that was before the water</a>
<a id='line_667'>gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and</a>
<a id='line_668'>those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were</a>
<a id='line_669'>attentive unto the book of the law.</a>
<a id='line_670'></a>
<a id='line_671'>8:4 And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had</a>
<a id='line_672'>made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and</a>
<a id='line_673'>Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and</a>
<a id='line_674'>on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchiah, and Hashum, and</a>
<a id='line_675'>Hashbadana, Zechariah, and Meshullam.</a>
<a id='line_676'></a>
<a id='line_677'>8:5 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he</a>
<a id='line_678'>was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood</a>
<a id='line_679'>up: 8:6 And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people</a>
<a id='line_680'>answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed</a>
<a id='line_681'>their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground.</a>
<a id='line_682'></a>
<a id='line_683'>8:7 Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai,</a>
<a id='line_684'>Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the</a>
<a id='line_685'>Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood</a>
<a id='line_686'>in their place.</a>
<a id='line_687'></a>
<a id='line_688'>8:8 So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and gave</a>
<a id='line_689'>the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.</a>
<a id='line_690'></a>
<a id='line_691'>8:9 And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the</a>
<a id='line_692'>scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the</a>
<a id='line_693'>people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep.</a>
<a id='line_694'>For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.</a>
<a id='line_695'></a>
<a id='line_696'>8:10 Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the</a>
<a id='line_697'>sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is prepared: for</a>
<a id='line_698'>this day is holy unto our LORD: neither be ye sorry; for the joy of</a>
<a id='line_699'>the LORD is your strength.</a>
<a id='line_700'></a>
<a id='line_701'>8:11 So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace,</a>
<a id='line_702'>for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.</a>
<a id='line_703'></a>
<a id='line_704'>8:12 And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to</a>
<a id='line_705'>send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood</a>
<a id='line_706'>the words that were declared unto them.</a>
<a id='line_707'></a>
<a id='line_708'>8:13 And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the</a>
<a id='line_709'>fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the</a>
<a id='line_710'>scribe, even to understand the words of the law.</a>
<a id='line_711'></a>
<a id='line_712'>8:14 And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by</a>
<a id='line_713'>Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast</a>
<a id='line_714'>of the seventh month: 8:15 And that they should publish and proclaim</a>
<a id='line_715'>in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the</a>
<a id='line_716'>mount, and fetch olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle</a>
<a id='line_717'>branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make</a>
<a id='line_718'>booths, as it is written.</a>
<a id='line_719'></a>
<a id='line_720'>8:16 So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves</a>
<a id='line_721'>booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and</a>
<a id='line_722'>in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water</a>
<a id='line_723'>gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.</a>
<a id='line_724'></a>
<a id='line_725'>8:17 And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the</a>
<a id='line_726'>captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of</a>
<a id='line_727'>Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel</a>
<a id='line_728'>done so. And there was very great gladness.</a>
<a id='line_729'></a>
<a id='line_730'>8:18 Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in</a>
<a id='line_731'>the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on</a>
<a id='line_732'>the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the manner.</a>
<a id='line_733'></a>
<a id='line_734'>9:1 Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of</a>
<a id='line_735'>Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and earth</a>
<a id='line_736'>upon them.</a>
<a id='line_737'></a>
<a id='line_738'>9:2 And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers,</a>
<a id='line_739'>and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their</a>
<a id='line_740'>fathers.</a>
<a id='line_741'></a>
<a id='line_742'>9:3 And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law</a>
<a id='line_743'>of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth</a>
<a id='line_744'>part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God.</a>
<a id='line_745'></a>
<a id='line_746'>9:4 Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani,</a>
<a id='line_747'>Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani, and cried</a>
<a id='line_748'>with a loud voice unto the LORD their God.</a>
<a id='line_749'></a>
<a id='line_750'>9:5 Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah,</a>
<a id='line_751'>Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless</a>
<a id='line_752'>the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be thy glorious name,</a>
<a id='line_753'>which is exalted above all blessing and praise.</a>
<a id='line_754'></a>
<a id='line_755'>9:6 Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven</a>
<a id='line_756'>of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all things that are</a>
<a id='line_757'>therein, the seas, and all that is therein, and thou preservest them</a>
<a id='line_758'>all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.</a>
<a id='line_759'></a>
<a id='line_760'>9:7 Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest</a>
<a id='line_761'>him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of</a>
<a id='line_762'>Abraham; 9:8 And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a</a>
<a id='line_763'>covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites,</a>
<a id='line_764'>the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the</a>
<a id='line_765'>Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast performed thy</a>
<a id='line_766'>words; for thou art righteous: 9:9 And didst see the affliction of our</a>
<a id='line_767'>fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red sea; 9:10 And</a>
<a id='line_768'>shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and</a>
<a id='line_769'>on all the people of his land: for thou knewest that they dealt</a>
<a id='line_770'>proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a name, as it is this</a>
<a id='line_771'>day.</a>
<a id='line_772'></a>
<a id='line_773'>9:11 And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went</a>
<a id='line_774'>through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their persecutors</a>
<a id='line_775'>thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the mighty waters.</a>
<a id='line_776'></a>
<a id='line_777'>9:12 Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and in</a>
<a id='line_778'>the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the way wherein</a>
<a id='line_779'>they should go.</a>
<a id='line_780'></a>
<a id='line_781'>9:13 Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them</a>
<a id='line_782'>from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws, good</a>
<a id='line_783'>statutes and commandments: 9:14 And madest known unto them thy holy</a>
<a id='line_784'>sabbath, and commandedst them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the</a>
<a id='line_785'>hand of Moses thy servant: 9:15 And gavest them bread from heaven for</a>
<a id='line_786'>their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for</a>
<a id='line_787'>their thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess</a>
<a id='line_788'>the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.</a>
<a id='line_789'></a>
<a id='line_790'>9:16 But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their necks,</a>
<a id='line_791'>and hearkened not to thy commandments, 9:17 And refused to obey,</a>
<a id='line_792'>neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them; but</a>
<a id='line_793'>hardened their necks, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to</a>
<a id='line_794'>return to their bondage: but thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious</a>
<a id='line_795'>and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest</a>
<a id='line_796'>them not.</a>
<a id='line_797'></a>
<a id='line_798'>9:18 Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy</a>
<a id='line_799'>God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great</a>
<a id='line_800'>provocations; 9:19 Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them</a>
<a id='line_801'>not in the wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them</a>
<a id='line_802'>by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night,</a>
<a id='line_803'>to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.</a>
<a id='line_804'></a>
<a id='line_805'>9:20 Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and</a>
<a id='line_806'>withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for</a>
<a id='line_807'>their thirst.</a>
<a id='line_808'></a>
<a id='line_809'>9:21 Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so</a>
<a id='line_810'>that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet</a>
<a id='line_811'>swelled not.</a>
<a id='line_812'></a>
<a id='line_813'>9:22 Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst divide</a>
<a id='line_814'>them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon, and the land</a>
<a id='line_815'>of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</a>
<a id='line_816'></a>
<a id='line_817'>9:23 Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and</a>
<a id='line_818'>broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst promised to</a>
<a id='line_819'>their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.</a>
<a id='line_820'></a>
<a id='line_821'>9:24 So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou</a>
<a id='line_822'>subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and</a>
<a id='line_823'>gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the</a>
<a id='line_824'>land, that they might do with them as they would.</a>
<a id='line_825'></a>
<a id='line_826'>9:25 And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses</a>
<a id='line_827'>full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit</a>
<a id='line_828'>trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat,</a>
<a id='line_829'>and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.</a>
<a id='line_830'></a>
<a id='line_831'>9:26 Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee,</a>
<a id='line_832'>and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets which</a>
<a id='line_833'>testified against them to turn them to thee, and they wrought great</a>
<a id='line_834'>provocations.</a>
<a id='line_835'></a>
<a id='line_836'>9:27 Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their enemies,</a>
<a id='line_837'>who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto</a>
<a id='line_838'>thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and according to thy manifold</a>
<a id='line_839'>mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of</a>
<a id='line_840'>their enemies.</a>
<a id='line_841'></a>
<a id='line_842'>9:28 But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee:</a>
<a id='line_843'>therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so that they</a>
<a id='line_844'>had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto</a>
<a id='line_845'>thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many times didst thou</a>
<a id='line_846'>deliver them according to thy mercies; 9:29 And testifiedst against</a>
<a id='line_847'>them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law: yet they dealt</a>
<a id='line_848'>proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against</a>
<a id='line_849'>thy judgments, (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and</a>
<a id='line_850'>withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.</a>
<a id='line_851'></a>
<a id='line_852'>9:30 Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst against</a>
<a id='line_853'>them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not give ear:</a>
<a id='line_854'>therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the people of the lands.</a>
<a id='line_855'></a>
<a id='line_856'>9:31 Nevertheless for thy great mercies’ sake thou didst not utterly</a>
<a id='line_857'>consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful</a>
<a id='line_858'>God.</a>
<a id='line_859'></a>
<a id='line_860'>9:32 Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible</a>
<a id='line_861'>God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the trouble seem</a>
<a id='line_862'>little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our</a>
<a id='line_863'>princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers,</a>
<a id='line_864'>and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto</a>
<a id='line_865'>this day.</a>
<a id='line_866'></a>
<a id='line_867'>9:33 Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou</a>
<a id='line_868'>hast done right, but we have done wickedly: 9:34 Neither have our</a>
<a id='line_869'>kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor</a>
<a id='line_870'>hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies, wherewith thou</a>
<a id='line_871'>didst testify against them.</a>
<a id='line_872'></a>
<a id='line_873'>9:35 For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great</a>
<a id='line_874'>goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which</a>
<a id='line_875'>thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.</a>
<a id='line_876'></a>
<a id='line_877'>9:36 Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou</a>
<a id='line_878'>gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof,</a>
<a id='line_879'>behold, we are servants in it: 9:37 And it yieldeth much increase unto</a>
<a id='line_880'>the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they</a>
<a id='line_881'>have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure,</a>
<a id='line_882'>and we are in great distress.</a>
<a id='line_883'></a>
<a id='line_884'>9:38 And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it;</a>
<a id='line_885'>and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.</a>
<a id='line_886'></a>
<a id='line_887'>10:1 Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of</a>

<a id='line_910'>wives, their sons, and their daughters, every one having knowledge,</a>
<a id='line_911'>and having understanding; 10:29 They clave to their brethren, their</a>
<a id='line_912'>nobles, and entered into a curse, and into an oath, to walk in God’s</a>
<a id='line_913'>law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and</a>
<a id='line_914'>do all the commandments of the LORD our Lord, and his judgments and</a>
<a id='line_915'>his statutes; 10:30 And that we would not give our daughters unto the</a>

<a id='line_921'></a>
<a id='line_922'>10:32 Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with</a>

<a id='line_1105'></a>
<a id='line_1106'>12:27 And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the</a>

<a id='line_1109'>singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.</a>
<a id='line_1110'></a>
<a id='line_1111'>12:28 And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both</a>
<a id='line_1112'>out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the villages</a>
<a id='line_1113'>of Netophathi; 12:29 Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the</a>
<a id='line_1114'>fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages</a>
<a id='line_1115'>round about Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1116'></a>
<a id='line_1117'>12:30 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and</a>
<a id='line_1118'>purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.</a>
<a id='line_1119'></a>
<a id='line_1120'>12:31 Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and</a>
<a id='line_1121'>appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one</a>
<a id='line_1122'>went on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate: 12:32 And</a>
<a id='line_1123'>after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah, 12:33 And</a>
<a id='line_1124'>Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam, 12:34 Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah,</a>
<a id='line_1125'>and Jeremiah, 12:35 And certain of the priests’ sons with trumpets;</a>
<a id='line_1126'>namely, Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of</a>
<a id='line_1127'>Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph:</a>
<a id='line_1128'>12:36 And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai,</a>
<a id='line_1129'>Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David</a>
<a id='line_1130'>the man of God, and Ezra the scribe before them.</a>
<a id='line_1131'></a>
<a id='line_1132'>12:37 And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went</a>
<a id='line_1133'>up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall,</a>
<a id='line_1134'>above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.</a>
<a id='line_1135'></a>
<a id='line_1136'>12:38 And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against</a>
<a id='line_1137'>them, and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from</a>
<a id='line_1138'>beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall; 12:39 And</a>
<a id='line_1139'>from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the</a>
<a id='line_1140'>fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto</a>
<a id='line_1141'>the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.</a>
<a id='line_1142'></a>
<a id='line_1143'>12:40 So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house</a>
<a id='line_1144'>of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me: 12:41 And the</a>
<a id='line_1145'>priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah,</a>
<a id='line_1146'>and Hananiah, with trumpets; 12:42 And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and</a>
<a id='line_1147'>Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer.</a>
<a id='line_1148'>And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.</a>
<a id='line_1149'></a>
<a id='line_1150'>12:43 Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for</a>
<a id='line_1151'>God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and the</a>
<a id='line_1152'>children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar</a>
<a id='line_1153'>off.</a>
<a id='line_1154'></a>
<a id='line_1155'>12:44 And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the</a>
<a id='line_1156'>treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes,</a>
<a id='line_1157'>to gather into them out of the fields of the cities the portions of</a>
<a id='line_1158'>the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the</a>
<a id='line_1159'>priests and for the Levites that waited.</a>
<a id='line_1160'></a>
<a id='line_1161'>12:45 And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their God,</a>
<a id='line_1162'>and the ward of the purification, according to the commandment of</a>
<a id='line_1163'>David, and of Solomon his son.</a>
<a id='line_1164'></a>
<a id='line_1165'>12:46 For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of</a>
<a id='line_1166'>the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.</a>
<a id='line_1167'></a>
<a id='line_1168'>12:47 And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of</a>
<a id='line_1169'>Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day</a>
<a id='line_1170'>his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto the Levites; and the</a>
<a id='line_1171'>Levites sanctified them unto the children of Aaron.</a>
<a id='line_1172'></a>
<a id='line_1173'>13:1 On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the</a>
<a id='line_1174'>people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the</a>
<a id='line_1175'>Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever; 13:2</a>
<a id='line_1176'>Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water,</a>
<a id='line_1177'>but hired Balaam against them, that he should curse them: howbeit our</a>
<a id='line_1178'>God turned the curse into a blessing.</a>
<a id='line_1179'></a>
<a id='line_1180'>13:3 Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they</a>
<a id='line_1181'>separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.</a>
<a id='line_1182'></a>
<a id='line_1183'>13:4 And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the</a>
<a id='line_1184'>chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah: 13:5 And he</a>
<a id='line_1185'>had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the</a>
<a id='line_1186'>meat offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of</a>
<a id='line_1187'>the corn, the new wine, and the oil, which was commanded to be given</a>
<a id='line_1188'>to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the offerings of</a>
<a id='line_1189'>the priests.</a>
<a id='line_1190'></a>
<a id='line_1191'>13:6 But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and</a>
<a id='line_1192'>thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto the king, and</a>
<a id='line_1193'>after certain days obtained I leave of the king: 13:7 And I came to</a>
<a id='line_1194'>Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in</a>
<a id='line_1195'>preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.</a>
<a id='line_1196'></a>
<a id='line_1197'>13:8 And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household</a>
<a id='line_1198'>stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber.</a>
<a id='line_1199'></a>
<a id='line_1200'>13:9 Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither</a>
<a id='line_1201'>brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat</a>
<a id='line_1202'>offering and the frankincense.</a>
<a id='line_1203'></a>
<a id='line_1204'>13:10 And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been</a>
<a id='line_1205'>given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were</a>
<a id='line_1206'>fled every one to his field.</a>
<a id='line_1207'></a>
<a id='line_1208'>13:11 Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of</a>
<a id='line_1209'>God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their</a>
<a id='line_1210'>place.</a>
<a id='line_1211'></a>
<a id='line_1212'>13:12 Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine</a>
<a id='line_1213'>and the oil unto the treasuries.</a>
<a id='line_1214'></a>
<a id='line_1215'>13:13 And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest,</a>
<a id='line_1216'>and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them</a>
<a id='line_1217'>was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were</a>
<a id='line_1218'>counted faithful, and their office was to distribute unto their</a>
<a id='line_1219'>brethren.</a>
<a id='line_1220'></a>
<a id='line_1221'>13:14 Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good</a>
<a id='line_1222'>deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the offices</a>
<a id='line_1223'>thereof.</a>
<a id='line_1224'></a>
<a id='line_1225'>13:15 In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the</a>
<a id='line_1226'>sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also wine,</a>
<a id='line_1227'>grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into</a>
<a id='line_1228'>Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified against them in the day</a>
<a id='line_1229'>wherein they sold victuals.</a>
<a id='line_1230'></a>
<a id='line_1231'>13:16 There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and</a>
<a id='line_1232'>all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of</a>
<a id='line_1233'>Judah, and in Jerusalem.</a>
<a id='line_1234'></a>
<a id='line_1235'>13:17 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them,</a>
<a id='line_1236'>What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?</a>
<a id='line_1237'>13:18 Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this</a>
<a id='line_1238'>evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel</a>
<a id='line_1239'>by profaning the sabbath.</a>
<a id='line_1240'></a>
<a id='line_1241'>13:19 And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to</a>
<a id='line_1242'>be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should be shut,</a>
<a id='line_1243'>and charged that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and</a>
<a id='line_1244'>some of my servants set I at the gates, that there should no burden be</a>
<a id='line_1245'>brought in on the sabbath day.</a>
<a id='line_1246'></a>
<a id='line_1247'>13:20 So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without</a>
<a id='line_1248'>Jerusalem once or twice.</a>
<a id='line_1249'></a>
<a id='line_1250'>13:21 Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye</a>
<a id='line_1251'>about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that</a>
<a id='line_1252'>time forth came they no more on the sabbath.</a>
<a id='line_1253'></a>
<a id='line_1254'>13:22 And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse themselves,</a>
<a id='line_1255'>and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath</a>
<a id='line_1256'>day.</a>
<a id='line_1257'></a>
<a id='line_1258'>Remember me, O my God, concerning this also, and spare me according to</a>
<a id='line_1259'>the greatness of thy mercy.</a>
<a id='line_1260'></a>
<a id='line_1261'>13:23 In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of Ashdod,</a>
<a id='line_1262'>of Ammon, and of Moab: 13:24 And their children spake half in the</a>
<a id='line_1263'>speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews’ language, but</a>
<a id='line_1264'>according to the language of each people.</a>
<a id='line_1265'></a>
<a id='line_1266'>13:25 And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of</a>
<a id='line_1267'>them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1268'>Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their</a>
<a id='line_1269'>daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.</a>
<a id='line_1270'></a>
<a id='line_1271'>13:26 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among</a>
<a id='line_1272'>many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of his God,</a>
<a id='line_1273'>and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did</a>
<a id='line_1274'>outlandish women cause to sin.</a>
<a id='line_1275'></a>
<a id='line_1276'>13:27 Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to</a>
<a id='line_1277'>transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?  13:28 And one</a>
<a id='line_1278'>of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in</a>
<a id='line_1279'>law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</a>
<a id='line_1280'></a>
<a id='line_1281'>13:29 Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the</a>
<a id='line_1282'>priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</a>
<a id='line_1283'></a>
<a id='line_1284'>13:30 Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the wards</a>
<a id='line_1285'>of the priests and the Levites, every one in his business; 13:31 And</a>
<a id='line_1286'>for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits.</a>
<a id='line_1287'>Remember me, O my God, for good.</a>
<a id='line_1288'></a>
