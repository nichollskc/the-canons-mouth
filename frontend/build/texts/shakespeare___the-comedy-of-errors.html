<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>EGEON.</a>
<a id='line_63'>Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall,</a>
<a id='line_64'>And by the doom of death end woes and all.</a>
<a id='line_65'></a>
<a id='line_66'>DUKE.</a>
<a id='line_67'>Merchant of Syracusa, plead no more.</a>
<a id='line_68'>I am not partial to infringe our laws.</a>
<a id='line_69'>The enmity and discord which of late</a>
<a id='line_70'>Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your Duke</a>
<a id='line_71'>To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,</a>
<a id='line_72'>Who, wanting guilders to redeem their lives,</a>
<a id='line_73'>Have seal’d his rigorous statutes with their bloods,</a>
<a id='line_74'>Excludes all pity from our threat’ning looks.</a>
<a id='line_75'>For since the mortal and intestine jars</a>
<a id='line_76'>’Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,</a>
<a id='line_77'>It hath in solemn synods been decreed,</a>
<a id='line_78'>Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,</a>
<a id='line_79'>To admit no traffic to our adverse towns;</a>
<a id='line_80'>Nay more, if any born at Ephesus</a>
<a id='line_81'>Be seen at Syracusian marts and fairs;</a>
<a id='line_82'>Again, if any Syracusian born</a>
<a id='line_83'>Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,</a>
<a id='line_84'>His goods confiscate to the Duke’s dispose,</a>
<a id='line_85'>Unless a thousand marks be levied</a>
<a id='line_86'>To quit the penalty and to ransom him.</a>
<a id='line_87'>Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,</a>
<a id='line_88'>Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;</a>
<a id='line_89'>Therefore by law thou art condemn’d to die.</a>
<a id='line_90'></a>
<a id='line_91'>EGEON.</a>
<a id='line_92'>Yet this my comfort; when your words are done,</a>
<a id='line_93'>My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</a>
<a id='line_94'></a>
<a id='line_95'>DUKE.</a>
<a id='line_96'>Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause</a>
<a id='line_97'>Why thou departedst from thy native home,</a>
<a id='line_98'>And for what cause thou cam’st to Ephesus.</a>
<a id='line_99'></a>
<a id='line_100'>EGEON.</a>
<a id='line_101'>A heavier task could not have been impos’d</a>
<a id='line_102'>Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable;</a>
<a id='line_103'>Yet, that the world may witness that my end</a>
<a id='line_104'>Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,</a>
<a id='line_105'>I’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.</a>
<a id='line_106'>In Syracusa was I born, and wed</a>
<a id='line_107'>Unto a woman happy but for me,</a>
<a id='line_108'>And by me, had not our hap been bad.</a>
<a id='line_109'>With her I liv’d in joy; our wealth increas’d</a>
<a id='line_110'>By prosperous voyages I often made</a>
<a id='line_111'>To Epidamnum, till my factor’s death,</a>
<a id='line_112'>And the great care of goods at random left,</a>
<a id='line_113'>Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse;</a>
<a id='line_114'>From whom my absence was not six months old</a>
<a id='line_115'>Before herself (almost at fainting under</a>
<a id='line_116'>The pleasing punishment that women bear)</a>
<a id='line_117'>Had made provision for her following me,</a>
<a id='line_118'>And soon and safe arrived where I was.</a>
<a id='line_119'>There had she not been long but she became</a>
<a id='line_120'>A joyful mother of two goodly sons,</a>
<a id='line_121'>And, which was strange, the one so like the other</a>
<a id='line_122'>As could not be distinguish’d but by names.</a>
<a id='line_123'>That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</a>
<a id='line_124'>A mean woman was delivered</a>
<a id='line_125'>Of such a burden, male twins, both alike.</a>
<a id='line_126'>Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,</a>
<a id='line_127'>I bought, and brought up to attend my sons.</a>
<a id='line_128'>My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</a>
<a id='line_129'>Made daily motions for our home return.</a>
<a id='line_130'>Unwilling I agreed; alas, too soon</a>
<a id='line_131'>We came aboard.</a>
<a id='line_132'>A league from Epidamnum had we sail’d</a>
<a id='line_133'>Before the always-wind-obeying deep</a>
<a id='line_134'>Gave any tragic instance of our harm;</a>
<a id='line_135'>But longer did we not retain much hope;</a>
<a id='line_136'>For what obscured light the heavens did grant</a>
<a id='line_137'>Did but convey unto our fearful minds</a>
<a id='line_138'>A doubtful warrant of immediate death,</a>
<a id='line_139'>Which though myself would gladly have embrac’d,</a>
<a id='line_140'>Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</a>
<a id='line_141'>Weeping before for what she saw must come,</a>
<a id='line_142'>And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</a>
<a id='line_143'>That mourn’d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</a>
<a id='line_144'>Forc’d me to seek delays for them and me.</a>
<a id='line_145'>And this it was (for other means was none).</a>
<a id='line_146'>The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</a>
<a id='line_147'>And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us.</a>
<a id='line_148'>My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</a>
<a id='line_149'>Had fast’ned him unto a small spare mast,</a>
<a id='line_150'>Such as sea-faring men provide for storms.</a>
<a id='line_151'>To him one of the other twins was bound,</a>
<a id='line_152'>Whilst I had been like heedful of the other.</a>
<a id='line_153'>The children thus dispos’d, my wife and I,</a>
<a id='line_154'>Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix’d,</a>
<a id='line_155'>Fast’ned ourselves at either end the mast,</a>
<a id='line_156'>And, floating straight, obedient to the stream,</a>
<a id='line_157'>Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</a>
<a id='line_158'>At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</a>
<a id='line_159'>Dispers’d those vapours that offended us,</a>
<a id='line_160'>And by the benefit of his wished light</a>
<a id='line_161'>The seas wax’d calm, and we discovered</a>
<a id='line_162'>Two ships from far, making amain to us,</a>
<a id='line_163'>Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this.</a>
<a id='line_164'>But ere they came—O, let me say no more!</a>
<a id='line_165'>Gather the sequel by that went before.</a>
<a id='line_166'></a>
<a id='line_167'>DUKE.</a>
<a id='line_168'>Nay, forward, old man, do not break off so,</a>
<a id='line_169'>For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</a>
<a id='line_170'></a>
<a id='line_171'>EGEON.</a>
<a id='line_172'>O, had the gods done so, I had not now</a>
<a id='line_173'>Worthily term’d them merciless to us.</a>
<a id='line_174'>For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</a>
<a id='line_175'>We were encountered by a mighty rock,</a>
<a id='line_176'>Which being violently borne upon,</a>
<a id='line_177'>Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</a>
<a id='line_178'>So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</a>
<a id='line_179'>Fortune had left to both of us alike</a>
<a id='line_180'>What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</a>
<a id='line_181'>Her part, poor soul, seeming as burdened</a>
<a id='line_182'>With lesser weight, but not with lesser woe,</a>
<a id='line_183'>Was carried with more speed before the wind,</a>
<a id='line_184'>And in our sight they three were taken up</a>
<a id='line_185'>By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</a>
<a id='line_186'>At length another ship had seiz’d on us;</a>
<a id='line_187'>And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,</a>
<a id='line_188'>Gave healthful welcome to their ship-wrack’d guests,</a>
<a id='line_189'>And would have reft the fishers of their prey,</a>
<a id='line_190'>Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</a>
<a id='line_191'>And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</a>
<a id='line_192'>Thus have you heard me sever’d from my bliss,</a>
<a id='line_193'>That by misfortunes was my life prolong’d</a>
<a id='line_194'>To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</a>
<a id='line_195'></a>
<a id='line_196'>DUKE.</a>
<a id='line_197'>And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,</a>
<a id='line_198'>Do me the favour to dilate at full</a>
<a id='line_199'>What have befall’n of them and thee till now.</a>
<a id='line_200'></a>
<a id='line_201'>EGEON.</a>
<a id='line_202'>My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,</a>
<a id='line_203'>At eighteen years became inquisitive</a>
<a id='line_204'>After his brother, and importun’d me</a>
<a id='line_205'>That his attendant, so his case was like,</a>
<a id='line_206'>Reft of his brother, but retain’d his name,</a>
<a id='line_207'>Might bear him company in the quest of him;</a>
<a id='line_208'>Whom whilst I laboured of a love to see,</a>
<a id='line_209'>I hazarded the loss of whom I lov’d.</a>
<a id='line_210'>Five summers have I spent in farthest Greece,</a>
<a id='line_211'>Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,</a>
<a id='line_212'>And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus,</a>
<a id='line_213'>Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought</a>
<a id='line_214'>Or that or any place that harbours men.</a>
<a id='line_215'>But here must end the story of my life;</a>
<a id='line_216'>And happy were I in my timely death,</a>
<a id='line_217'>Could all my travels warrant me they live.</a>
<a id='line_218'></a>
<a id='line_219'>DUKE.</a>
<a id='line_220'>Hapless Egeon, whom the fates have mark’d</a>
<a id='line_221'>To bear the extremity of dire mishap;</a>
<a id='line_222'>Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,</a>
<a id='line_223'>Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,</a>
<a id='line_224'>Which princes, would they, may not disannul,</a>
<a id='line_225'>My soul should sue as advocate for thee.</a>
<a id='line_226'>But though thou art adjudged to the death,</a>
<a id='line_227'>And passed sentence may not be recall’d</a>
<a id='line_228'>But to our honour’s great disparagement,</a>
<a id='line_229'>Yet will I favour thee in what I can.</a>
<a id='line_230'>Therefore, merchant, I’ll limit thee this day</a>
<a id='line_231'>To seek thy health by beneficial help.</a>
<a id='line_232'>Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;</a>
<a id='line_233'>Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,</a>
<a id='line_234'>And live; if no, then thou art doom’d to die.</a>
<a id='line_235'>Jailer, take him to thy custody.</a>
<a id='line_236'></a>
<a id='line_237'>JAILER.</a>
<a id='line_238'>I will, my lord.</a>

<a id='line_240'>EGEON.</a>
<a id='line_241'>Hopeless and helpless doth Egeon wend,</a>

<a id='line_250'>MERCHANT.</a>
<a id='line_251'>Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,</a>

<a id='line_746'></a>
<a id='line_747'>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_748'>By what rule, sir?</a>
<a id='line_749'></a>
<a id='line_750'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_751'>Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of Father Time</a>
<a id='line_752'>himself.</a>
<a id='line_753'></a>
<a id='line_754'>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_755'>Let’s hear it.</a>
<a id='line_756'></a>
<a id='line_757'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_758'>There’s no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by</a>
<a id='line_759'>nature.</a>
<a id='line_760'></a>
<a id='line_761'>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_762'>May he not do it by fine and recovery?</a>
<a id='line_763'></a>
<a id='line_764'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_765'>Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig, and recover the lost hair of another</a>
<a id='line_766'>man.</a>
<a id='line_767'></a>
<a id='line_768'>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_769'>Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is, so plentiful an</a>
<a id='line_770'>excrement?</a>
<a id='line_771'></a>
<a id='line_772'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_773'>Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts, and what he hath</a>
<a id='line_774'>scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.</a>
<a id='line_775'></a>
<a id='line_776'>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_777'>Why, but there’s many a man hath more hair than wit.</a>
<a id='line_778'></a>
<a id='line_779'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_780'>Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.</a>
<a id='line_781'></a>
<a id='line_782'>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_783'>Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.</a>
<a id='line_784'></a>
<a id='line_785'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_786'>The plainer dealer, the sooner lost. Yet he loseth it in a kind of</a>
<a id='line_787'>jollity.</a>
<a id='line_788'></a>
<a id='line_789'>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_790'>For what reason?</a>
<a id='line_791'></a>
<a id='line_792'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_793'>For two, and sound ones too.</a>
<a id='line_794'></a>
<a id='line_795'>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_796'>Nay, not sound, I pray you.</a>
<a id='line_797'></a>
<a id='line_798'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_799'>Sure ones, then.</a>
<a id='line_800'></a>
<a id='line_801'>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_802'>Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.</a>
<a id='line_803'></a>
<a id='line_804'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_805'>Certain ones, then.</a>
<a id='line_806'></a>
<a id='line_807'>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_808'>Name them.</a>
<a id='line_809'></a>
<a id='line_810'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_811'>The one, to save the money that he spends in tiring; the other, that at</a>
<a id='line_812'>dinner they should not drop in his porridge.</a>
<a id='line_813'></a>
<a id='line_814'>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_815'>You would all this time have proved there is no time for all things.</a>
<a id='line_816'></a>
<a id='line_817'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_818'>Marry, and did, sir; namely, e’en no time to recover hair lost by</a>
<a id='line_819'>nature.</a>
<a id='line_820'></a>
<a id='line_821'>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_822'>But your reason was not substantial why there is no time to recover.</a>
<a id='line_823'></a>
<a id='line_824'>DROMIO OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_825'>Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald, and therefore, to the world’s end</a>
<a id='line_826'>will have bald followers.</a>
<a id='line_827'></a>
<a id='line_828'>ANTIPHOLUS OF SYRACUSE.</a>
<a id='line_829'>I knew ’twould be a bald conclusion.</a>
