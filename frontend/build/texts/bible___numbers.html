<a id='line_1014'></a>
<a id='line_1015'>8:17 For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both</a>

<a id='line_1018'></a>
<a id='line_1019'>8:18 And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the</a>

<a id='line_1032'></a>
<a id='line_1033'>8:21 And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and</a>
<a id='line_1034'>Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an</a>

<a id='line_1036'></a>
<a id='line_1037'>8:22 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the</a>

<a id='line_1039'>the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto</a>
<a id='line_1040'>them.</a>
<a id='line_1041'></a>
<a id='line_1042'>8:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 8:24 This is it that</a>
<a id='line_1043'>belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward</a>
<a id='line_1044'>they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_1045'>congregation: 8:25 And from the age of fifty years they shall cease</a>
<a id='line_1046'>waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more: 8:26 But</a>
<a id='line_1047'>shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_1048'>congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt</a>
<a id='line_1049'>thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.</a>
<a id='line_1050'></a>
<a id='line_1051'>9:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the</a>
<a id='line_1052'>first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of</a>
<a id='line_1053'>Egypt, saying, 9:2 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover</a>

<a id='line_1055'></a>
<a id='line_1056'>9:3 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it in</a>

<a id='line_1059'></a>
<a id='line_1060'>9:4 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should keep</a>
<a id='line_1061'>the passover.</a>
<a id='line_1062'></a>
<a id='line_1063'>9:5 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first</a>
<a id='line_1064'>month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all that the</a>
<a id='line_1065'>LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1066'></a>
<a id='line_1067'>9:6 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body of a</a>
<a id='line_1068'>man, that they could not keep the passover on that day: and they came</a>
<a id='line_1069'>before Moses and before Aaron on that day: 9:7 And those men said unto</a>
<a id='line_1070'>him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept</a>
<a id='line_1071'>back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed</a>
<a id='line_1072'>season among the children of Israel?  9:8 And Moses said unto them,</a>
<a id='line_1073'>Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning</a>
<a id='line_1074'>you.</a>
<a id='line_1075'></a>
<a id='line_1076'>9:9 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 9:10 Speak unto the</a>
<a id='line_1077'>children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity</a>
<a id='line_1078'>shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar</a>
<a id='line_1079'>off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1080'></a>
<a id='line_1081'>9:11 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep</a>
<a id='line_1082'>it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.</a>
<a id='line_1083'></a>
<a id='line_1084'>9:12 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone</a>
<a id='line_1085'>of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep</a>
<a id='line_1086'>it.</a>
<a id='line_1087'></a>
<a id='line_1088'>9:13 But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and</a>
<a id='line_1089'>forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off</a>
<a id='line_1090'>from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1091'>in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.</a>
<a id='line_1092'></a>
<a id='line_1093'>9:14 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the</a>

<a id='line_1096'>ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the</a>

<a id='line_1098'></a>
<a id='line_1099'>9:15 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud</a>
<a id='line_1100'>covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even</a>
<a id='line_1101'>there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until</a>
<a id='line_1102'>the morning.</a>
<a id='line_1103'></a>
<a id='line_1104'>9:16 So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance</a>
<a id='line_1105'>of fire by night.</a>
<a id='line_1106'></a>
<a id='line_1107'>9:17 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after</a>
<a id='line_1108'>that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the</a>
<a id='line_1109'>cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.</a>
<a id='line_1110'></a>
<a id='line_1111'>9:18 At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed,</a>
<a id='line_1112'>and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud</a>
<a id='line_1113'>abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.</a>
<a id='line_1114'></a>
<a id='line_1115'>9:19 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days,</a>

<a id='line_1117'>not.</a>
<a id='line_1118'></a>
<a id='line_1119'>9:20 And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle;</a>
<a id='line_1120'>according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents,</a>
<a id='line_1121'>and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed.</a>
<a id='line_1122'></a>
<a id='line_1123'>9:21 And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning,</a>
<a id='line_1124'>and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed:</a>
<a id='line_1125'>whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they</a>
<a id='line_1126'>journeyed.</a>
<a id='line_1127'></a>
<a id='line_1128'>9:22 Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the</a>
<a id='line_1129'>cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of</a>
<a id='line_1130'>Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken</a>
<a id='line_1131'>up, they journeyed.</a>
<a id='line_1132'></a>
<a id='line_1133'>9:23 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at</a>
<a id='line_1134'>the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of</a>

<a id='line_1136'></a>
<a id='line_1137'>10:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 10:2 Make thee two</a>
<a id='line_1138'>trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou</a>
<a id='line_1139'>mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the</a>
<a id='line_1140'>journeying of the camps.</a>
<a id='line_1141'></a>
<a id='line_1142'>10:3 And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall</a>
<a id='line_1143'>assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the</a>

<a id='line_1145'></a>
<a id='line_1146'>10:4 And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which</a>
<a id='line_1147'>are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto</a>

<a id='line_1149'></a>
<a id='line_1150'>10:5 When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts</a>

<a id='line_1154'>the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for</a>
<a id='line_1155'>their journeys.</a>
<a id='line_1156'></a>
<a id='line_1157'>10:7 But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_1158'>blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.</a>
<a id='line_1159'></a>
<a id='line_1160'>10:8 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets;</a>
<a id='line_1161'>and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your</a>

<a id='line_1163'></a>
<a id='line_1164'>10:9 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that</a>
<a id='line_1165'>oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye</a>
<a id='line_1166'>shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved</a>
<a id='line_1167'>from your enemies.</a>
<a id='line_1168'></a>
<a id='line_1169'>10:10 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and</a>

<a id='line_1172'>that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD</a>

<a id='line_1224'>10:26 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was</a>
<a id='line_1225'>Pagiel the son of Ocran.</a>
<a id='line_1226'></a>
<a id='line_1227'>10:27 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was</a>
<a id='line_1228'>Ahira the son of Enan.</a>
<a id='line_1229'></a>
<a id='line_1230'>10:28 Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according to</a>
<a id='line_1231'>their armies, when they set forward.</a>
<a id='line_1232'></a>
<a id='line_1233'>10:29 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,</a>
<a id='line_1234'>Mosesâ€™ father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the</a>
<a id='line_1235'>LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee</a>
<a id='line_1236'>good: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1237'></a>
<a id='line_1238'>10:30 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine</a>
<a id='line_1239'>own land, and to my kindred.</a>
<a id='line_1240'></a>
<a id='line_1241'>10:31 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou</a>
<a id='line_1242'>knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to</a>
<a id='line_1243'>us instead of eyes.</a>
<a id='line_1244'></a>
<a id='line_1245'>10:32 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what</a>
<a id='line_1246'>goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_1247'></a>
<a id='line_1248'>10:33 And they departed from the mount of the LORD three daysâ€™</a>
<a id='line_1249'>journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in</a>
<a id='line_1250'>the three daysâ€™ journey, to search out a resting place for them.</a>
<a id='line_1251'></a>
<a id='line_1252'>10:34 And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went</a>
<a id='line_1253'>out of the camp.</a>
<a id='line_1254'></a>
<a id='line_1255'>10:35 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said,</a>
<a id='line_1256'>Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that</a>
<a id='line_1257'>hate thee flee before thee.</a>
<a id='line_1258'></a>
<a id='line_1259'>10:36 And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many</a>
<a id='line_1260'>thousands of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1261'></a>
<a id='line_1262'>11:1 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the</a>
<a id='line_1263'>LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1264'>burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts</a>
<a id='line_1265'>of the camp.</a>
<a id='line_1266'></a>
<a id='line_1267'>11:2 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the</a>
<a id='line_1268'>LORD, the fire was quenched.</a>
<a id='line_1269'></a>
<a id='line_1270'>11:3 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of</a>
<a id='line_1271'>the LORD burnt among them.</a>
<a id='line_1272'></a>
<a id='line_1273'>11:4 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and</a>
<a id='line_1274'>the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us</a>
<a id='line_1275'>flesh to eat?  11:5 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt</a>
<a id='line_1276'>freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions,</a>
<a id='line_1277'>and the garlick: 11:6 But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing</a>
<a id='line_1278'>at all, beside this manna, before our eyes.</a>
<a id='line_1279'></a>
<a id='line_1280'>11:7 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as</a>
<a id='line_1281'>the colour of bdellium.</a>
<a id='line_1282'></a>
<a id='line_1283'>11:8 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in</a>
<a id='line_1284'>mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of</a>
<a id='line_1285'>it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.</a>
<a id='line_1286'></a>
<a id='line_1287'>11:9 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell</a>
<a id='line_1288'>upon it.</a>
<a id='line_1289'></a>
<a id='line_1290'>11:10 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,</a>
<a id='line_1291'>every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was</a>
<a id='line_1292'>kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.</a>
<a id='line_1293'></a>
<a id='line_1294'>11:11 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy</a>
<a id='line_1295'>servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou</a>
<a id='line_1296'>layest the burden of all this people upon me?  11:12 Have I conceived</a>
<a id='line_1297'>all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto</a>
<a id='line_1298'>me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking</a>
<a id='line_1299'>child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers?  11:13</a>
<a id='line_1300'>Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep</a>
<a id='line_1301'>unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.</a>
<a id='line_1302'></a>
<a id='line_1303'>11:14 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too</a>
<a id='line_1304'>heavy for me.</a>
<a id='line_1305'></a>
<a id='line_1306'>11:15 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of</a>
<a id='line_1307'>hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my</a>
<a id='line_1308'>wretchedness.</a>
<a id='line_1309'></a>
<a id='line_1310'>11:16 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the</a>
<a id='line_1311'>elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people,</a>
<a id='line_1312'>and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_1313'>congregation, that they may stand there with thee.</a>
<a id='line_1314'></a>
<a id='line_1315'>11:17 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take</a>
<a id='line_1316'>of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they</a>
<a id='line_1317'>shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not</a>
<a id='line_1318'>thyself alone.</a>
<a id='line_1319'></a>
<a id='line_1320'>11:18 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to</a>
<a id='line_1321'>morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the</a>
<a id='line_1322'>LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us</a>
<a id='line_1323'>in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.</a>
<a id='line_1324'></a>
<a id='line_1325'>11:19 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither</a>
<a id='line_1326'>ten days, nor twenty days; 11:20 But even a whole month, until it come</a>
<a id='line_1327'>out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye</a>
<a id='line_1328'>have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him,</a>
<a id='line_1329'>saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt?  11:21 And Moses said, The</a>
<a id='line_1330'>people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou</a>
<a id='line_1331'>hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.</a>
<a id='line_1332'></a>
<a id='line_1333'>11:22 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice</a>
<a id='line_1334'>them?  or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them,</a>
<a id='line_1335'>to suffice them?  11:23 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORDâ€™s</a>
<a id='line_1336'>hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to</a>
<a id='line_1337'>pass unto thee or not.</a>
<a id='line_1338'></a>
<a id='line_1339'>11:24 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_1340'>and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them</a>
<a id='line_1341'>round about the tabernacle.</a>
<a id='line_1342'></a>
<a id='line_1343'>11:25 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took</a>
<a id='line_1344'>of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders:</a>
<a id='line_1345'>and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they</a>
<a id='line_1346'>prophesied, and did not cease.</a>
<a id='line_1347'></a>
<a id='line_1348'>11:26 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the</a>
<a id='line_1349'>one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested</a>
<a id='line_1350'>upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out</a>
<a id='line_1351'>unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp.</a>
<a id='line_1352'></a>
<a id='line_1353'>11:27 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and</a>
<a id='line_1354'>Medad do prophesy in the camp.</a>
<a id='line_1355'></a>
<a id='line_1356'>11:28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his</a>
<a id='line_1357'>young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.</a>
<a id='line_1358'></a>
<a id='line_1359'>11:29 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God</a>
<a id='line_1360'>that all the LORDâ€™s people were prophets, and that the LORD would put</a>
<a id='line_1361'>his spirit upon them!  11:30 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and</a>
<a id='line_1362'>the elders of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1363'></a>
<a id='line_1364'>11:31 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails</a>
<a id='line_1365'>from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a dayâ€™s</a>
<a id='line_1366'>journey on this side, and as it were a dayâ€™s journey on the other</a>
<a id='line_1367'>side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the</a>
<a id='line_1368'>face of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_1369'></a>
<a id='line_1370'>11:32 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and</a>
<a id='line_1371'>all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least</a>
<a id='line_1372'>gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves</a>
<a id='line_1373'>round about the camp.</a>
<a id='line_1374'></a>
<a id='line_1375'>11:33 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was</a>
<a id='line_1376'>chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the</a>
<a id='line_1377'>LORD smote the people with a very great plague.</a>
<a id='line_1378'></a>
<a id='line_1379'>11:34 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because</a>
<a id='line_1380'>there they buried the people that lusted.</a>
<a id='line_1381'></a>
<a id='line_1382'>11:35 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;</a>
<a id='line_1383'>and abode at Hazeroth.</a>
<a id='line_1384'></a>
<a id='line_1385'>12:1 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the Ethiopian</a>
<a id='line_1386'>woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.</a>
<a id='line_1387'></a>
<a id='line_1388'>12:2 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he</a>
<a id='line_1389'>not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.</a>
<a id='line_1390'></a>
<a id='line_1391'>12:3 (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were</a>
<a id='line_1392'>upon the face of the earth.)  12:4 And the LORD spake suddenly unto</a>
<a id='line_1393'>Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the</a>
<a id='line_1394'>tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out.</a>
<a id='line_1395'></a>
<a id='line_1396'>12:5 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in</a>
<a id='line_1397'>the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both</a>
<a id='line_1398'>came forth.</a>
<a id='line_1399'></a>
<a id='line_1400'>12:6 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you,</a>
<a id='line_1401'>I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak</a>
<a id='line_1402'>unto him in a dream.</a>
<a id='line_1403'></a>
<a id='line_1404'>12:7 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.</a>
<a id='line_1405'></a>
<a id='line_1406'>12:8 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in</a>
<a id='line_1407'>dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold:</a>
<a id='line_1408'>wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?</a>
<a id='line_1409'>12:9 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he</a>
<a id='line_1410'>departed.</a>
<a id='line_1411'></a>
<a id='line_1412'>12:10 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold,</a>
<a id='line_1413'>Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam,</a>
<a id='line_1414'>and, behold, she was leprous.</a>
<a id='line_1415'></a>
<a id='line_1416'>12:11 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay</a>
<a id='line_1417'>not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we</a>
<a id='line_1418'>have sinned.</a>
<a id='line_1419'></a>
<a id='line_1420'>12:12 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed</a>
<a id='line_1421'>when he cometh out of his motherâ€™s womb.</a>
<a id='line_1422'></a>
<a id='line_1423'>12:13 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I</a>
<a id='line_1424'>beseech thee.</a>
<a id='line_1425'></a>
<a id='line_1426'>12:14 And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her</a>
<a id='line_1427'>face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from</a>
<a id='line_1428'>the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.</a>
<a id='line_1429'></a>
<a id='line_1430'>12:15 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people</a>
<a id='line_1431'>journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.</a>
<a id='line_1432'></a>
<a id='line_1433'>12:16 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in</a>
<a id='line_1434'>the wilderness of Paran.</a>
<a id='line_1435'></a>
<a id='line_1436'>13:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 13:2 Send thou men, that</a>
<a id='line_1437'>they may search the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of</a>
<a id='line_1438'>Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one</a>
<a id='line_1439'>a ruler among them.</a>
<a id='line_1440'></a>
<a id='line_1441'>13:3 And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the</a>
<a id='line_1442'>wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of</a>
<a id='line_1443'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1444'></a>
<a id='line_1445'>13:4 And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the</a>
<a id='line_1446'>son of Zaccur.</a>
<a id='line_1447'></a>
<a id='line_1448'>13:5 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.</a>
<a id='line_1449'></a>
<a id='line_1450'>13:6 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.</a>
<a id='line_1451'></a>
<a id='line_1452'>13:7 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.</a>
<a id='line_1453'></a>
<a id='line_1454'>13:8 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.</a>
<a id='line_1455'></a>
<a id='line_1456'>13:9 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.</a>
<a id='line_1457'></a>
<a id='line_1458'>13:10 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.</a>
<a id='line_1459'></a>
<a id='line_1460'>13:11 Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi</a>
<a id='line_1461'>the son of Susi.</a>
<a id='line_1462'></a>
<a id='line_1463'>13:12 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.</a>
<a id='line_1464'></a>
<a id='line_1465'>13:13 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.</a>
<a id='line_1466'></a>
<a id='line_1467'>13:14 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.</a>
<a id='line_1468'></a>
<a id='line_1469'>13:15 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.</a>
<a id='line_1470'></a>
<a id='line_1471'>13:16 These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the</a>
<a id='line_1472'>land.</a>
<a id='line_1473'></a>
<a id='line_1474'>And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.</a>
<a id='line_1475'></a>
<a id='line_1476'>13:17 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_1477'>them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain:</a>
<a id='line_1478'>13:18 And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth</a>
<a id='line_1479'>therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many; 13:19 And what</a>
<a id='line_1480'>the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad; and what</a>
<a id='line_1481'>cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong</a>
<a id='line_1482'>holds; 13:20 And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether</a>
<a id='line_1483'>there be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of</a>
<a id='line_1484'>the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the firstripe</a>
<a id='line_1485'>grapes.</a>
<a id='line_1486'></a>
<a id='line_1487'>13:21 So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of</a>
<a id='line_1488'>Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.</a>
<a id='line_1489'></a>
<a id='line_1490'>13:22 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where</a>
<a id='line_1491'>Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron</a>
<a id='line_1492'>was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)  13:23 And they came unto</a>
<a id='line_1493'>the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one</a>
<a id='line_1494'>cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a staff; and they</a>
<a id='line_1495'>brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.</a>
<a id='line_1496'></a>
<a id='line_1497'>13:24 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of</a>
<a id='line_1498'>grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.</a>
<a id='line_1499'></a>
<a id='line_1500'>13:25 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.</a>
<a id='line_1501'></a>
<a id='line_1502'>13:26 And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the</a>
<a id='line_1503'>congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran,</a>
<a id='line_1504'>to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the</a>
<a id='line_1505'>congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.</a>
<a id='line_1506'></a>
<a id='line_1507'>13:27 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou</a>
<a id='line_1508'>sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the</a>
<a id='line_1509'>fruit of it.</a>
<a id='line_1510'></a>
<a id='line_1511'>13:28 Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and</a>
<a id='line_1512'>the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the</a>
<a id='line_1513'>children of Anak there.</a>
<a id='line_1514'></a>
<a id='line_1515'>13:29 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites,</a>
<a id='line_1516'>and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the</a>
<a id='line_1517'>Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_1518'></a>
<a id='line_1519'>13:30 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go</a>
<a id='line_1520'>up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.</a>
<a id='line_1521'></a>
<a id='line_1522'>13:31 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up</a>
<a id='line_1523'>against the people; for they are stronger than we.</a>
<a id='line_1524'></a>
<a id='line_1525'>13:32 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had</a>
<a id='line_1526'>searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which</a>
<a id='line_1527'>we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants</a>
<a id='line_1528'>thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great</a>
<a id='line_1529'>stature.</a>
<a id='line_1530'></a>
<a id='line_1531'>13:33 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the</a>
<a id='line_1532'>giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were</a>
<a id='line_1533'>in their sight.</a>
<a id='line_1534'></a>
<a id='line_1535'>14:1 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and</a>
<a id='line_1536'>the people wept that night.</a>
<a id='line_1537'></a>
<a id='line_1538'>14:2 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against</a>
<a id='line_1539'>Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we</a>
<a id='line_1540'>had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this</a>
<a id='line_1541'>wilderness!  14:3 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this</a>
<a id='line_1542'>land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be</a>
<a id='line_1543'>a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?  14:4 And they</a>
<a id='line_1544'>said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into</a>
<a id='line_1545'>Egypt.</a>
<a id='line_1546'></a>
<a id='line_1547'>14:5 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly</a>
<a id='line_1548'>of the congregation of the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1549'></a>
<a id='line_1550'>14:6 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which</a>
<a id='line_1551'>were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: 14:7 And they</a>
<a id='line_1552'>spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The</a>
<a id='line_1553'>land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land.</a>
<a id='line_1554'></a>
<a id='line_1555'>14:8 If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land,</a>
<a id='line_1556'>and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.</a>
<a id='line_1557'></a>
<a id='line_1558'>14:9 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of</a>
<a id='line_1559'>the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from</a>
<a id='line_1560'>them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.</a>
<a id='line_1561'></a>
<a id='line_1562'>14:10 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the</a>
<a id='line_1563'>glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation</a>
<a id='line_1564'>before all the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1565'></a>
<a id='line_1566'>14:11 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke</a>
<a id='line_1567'>me?  and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs</a>
<a id='line_1568'>which I have shewed among them?  14:12 I will smite them with the</a>
<a id='line_1569'>pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater</a>
<a id='line_1570'>nation and mightier than they.</a>
<a id='line_1571'></a>
<a id='line_1572'>14:13 And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it,</a>
<a id='line_1573'>(for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)</a>
<a id='line_1574'>14:14 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they</a>
<a id='line_1575'>have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art</a>
<a id='line_1576'>seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that</a>
<a id='line_1577'>thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a</a>
<a id='line_1578'>pillar of fire by night.</a>
<a id='line_1579'></a>
<a id='line_1580'>14:15 Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the</a>
<a id='line_1581'>nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, 14:16</a>
<a id='line_1582'>Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which</a>
<a id='line_1583'>he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_1584'></a>
<a id='line_1585'>14:17 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great,</a>
<a id='line_1586'>according as thou hast spoken, saying, 14:18 The LORD is</a>
<a id='line_1587'>longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and</a>
<a id='line_1588'>transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the</a>
<a id='line_1589'>iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth</a>
<a id='line_1590'>generation.</a>
<a id='line_1591'></a>
<a id='line_1592'>14:19 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according</a>
<a id='line_1593'>unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this</a>
<a id='line_1594'>people, from Egypt even until now.</a>
<a id='line_1595'></a>
<a id='line_1596'>14:20 And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: 14:21</a>
<a id='line_1597'>But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory</a>
<a id='line_1598'>of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1599'></a>
<a id='line_1600'>14:22 Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles,</a>
<a id='line_1601'>which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now</a>
<a id='line_1602'>these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; 14:23 Surely they</a>
<a id='line_1603'>shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall</a>
<a id='line_1604'>any of them that provoked me see it: 14:24 But my servant Caleb,</a>
<a id='line_1605'>because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully,</a>
<a id='line_1606'>him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall</a>
<a id='line_1607'>possess it.</a>
<a id='line_1608'></a>
<a id='line_1609'>14:25 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)</a>
<a id='line_1610'>Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the</a>
<a id='line_1611'>Red sea.</a>
<a id='line_1612'></a>
<a id='line_1613'>14:26 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 14:27 How</a>
<a id='line_1614'>long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against</a>
<a id='line_1615'>me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they</a>
<a id='line_1616'>murmur against me.</a>
<a id='line_1617'></a>
<a id='line_1618'>14:28 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have</a>
<a id='line_1619'>spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: 14:29 Your carcases shall</a>
<a id='line_1620'>fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according</a>
<a id='line_1621'>to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward which have</a>
<a id='line_1622'>murmured against me.</a>
<a id='line_1623'></a>
<a id='line_1624'>14:30 Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I</a>
<a id='line_1625'>sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and</a>
<a id='line_1626'>Joshua the son of Nun.</a>
<a id='line_1627'></a>
<a id='line_1628'>14:31 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will</a>
<a id='line_1629'>I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.</a>
<a id='line_1630'></a>
<a id='line_1631'>14:32 But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this</a>
<a id='line_1632'>wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_1633'></a>
<a id='line_1634'>14:33 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years,</a>
<a id='line_1635'>and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the</a>
<a id='line_1636'>wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_1637'></a>
<a id='line_1638'>14:34 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even</a>
<a id='line_1639'>forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even</a>
<a id='line_1640'>forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise.</a>
<a id='line_1641'></a>
<a id='line_1642'>14:35 I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil</a>
<a id='line_1643'>congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this</a>
<a id='line_1644'>wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.</a>
<a id='line_1645'></a>
<a id='line_1646'>14:36 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned,</a>
<a id='line_1647'>and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a</a>
<a id='line_1648'>slander upon the land, 14:37 Even those men that did bring up the evil</a>
<a id='line_1649'>report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1650'></a>
<a id='line_1651'>14:38 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which</a>
<a id='line_1652'>were of the men that went to search the land, lived still.</a>
<a id='line_1653'></a>
<a id='line_1654'>14:39 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel:</a>
<a id='line_1655'>and the people mourned greatly.</a>
<a id='line_1656'></a>
<a id='line_1657'>14:40 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the</a>
<a id='line_1658'>top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the</a>
<a id='line_1659'>place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned.</a>
<a id='line_1660'></a>
<a id='line_1661'>14:41 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment</a>
<a id='line_1662'>of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.</a>
<a id='line_1663'></a>
<a id='line_1664'>14:42 Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten</a>
<a id='line_1665'>before your enemies.</a>
<a id='line_1666'></a>
<a id='line_1667'>14:43 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and</a>
<a id='line_1668'>ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_1669'>therefore the LORD will not be with you.</a>
<a id='line_1670'></a>
<a id='line_1671'>14:44 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the</a>
<a id='line_1672'>ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the</a>
<a id='line_1673'>camp.</a>
<a id='line_1674'></a>
<a id='line_1675'>14:45 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in</a>
<a id='line_1676'>that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.</a>
<a id='line_1677'></a>
<a id='line_1678'>15:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:2 Speak unto the</a>
<a id='line_1679'>children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land</a>
<a id='line_1680'>of your habitations, which I give unto you, 15:3 And will make an</a>
<a id='line_1681'>offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in</a>
<a id='line_1682'>performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts,</a>
<a id='line_1683'>to make a sweet savour unto the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:</a>
<a id='line_1684'>15:4 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a</a>
<a id='line_1685'>meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of</a>
<a id='line_1686'>an hin of oil.</a>
<a id='line_1687'></a>
<a id='line_1688'>15:5 And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering shalt</a>
<a id='line_1689'>thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for one lamb.</a>
<a id='line_1690'></a>
<a id='line_1691'>15:6 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth</a>
<a id='line_1692'>deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.</a>
<a id='line_1693'></a>
<a id='line_1694'>15:7 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an</a>
<a id='line_1695'>hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1696'></a>
<a id='line_1697'>15:8 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for a</a>
<a id='line_1698'>sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the LORD: 15:9</a>
<a id='line_1699'>Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three tenth</a>
<a id='line_1700'>deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.</a>
<a id='line_1701'></a>
<a id='line_1702'>15:10 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine,</a>
<a id='line_1703'>for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1704'></a>
<a id='line_1705'>15:11 Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for a</a>
<a id='line_1706'>lamb, or a kid.</a>
<a id='line_1707'></a>
<a id='line_1708'>15:12 According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do to</a>
<a id='line_1709'>every one according to their number.</a>
<a id='line_1710'></a>
<a id='line_1711'>15:13 All that are born of the country shall do these things after</a>

<a id='line_1714'></a>
<a id='line_1715'>15:14 And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you in</a>

<a id='line_1718'></a>
<a id='line_1719'>15:15 One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and</a>

<a id='line_1722'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1723'></a>
<a id='line_1724'>15:16 One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger</a>

<a id='line_1730'>bread of the land, ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1731'></a>
<a id='line_1732'>15:20 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an heave</a>

<a id='line_1734'>ye heave it.</a>
<a id='line_1735'></a>
<a id='line_1736'>15:21 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an heave</a>
<a id='line_1737'>offering in your generations.</a>
<a id='line_1738'></a>
<a id='line_1739'>15:22 And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments,</a>
<a id='line_1740'>which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses, 15:23 Even all that the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1741'>hath commanded you by the hand of Moses, from the day that the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1742'>commanded Moses, and henceforward among your generations; 15:24 Then</a>
<a id='line_1743'>it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without the knowledge</a>
<a id='line_1744'>of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young</a>
<a id='line_1745'>bullock for a burnt offering, for a sweet savour unto the LORD, with</a>
<a id='line_1746'>his meat offering, and his drink offering, according to the manner,</a>
<a id='line_1747'>and one kid of the goats for a sin offering.</a>
<a id='line_1748'></a>
<a id='line_1749'>15:25 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation</a>

<a id='line_1752'>fire unto the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their</a>
<a id='line_1753'>ignorance: 15:26 And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the</a>
<a id='line_1754'>children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them;</a>

<a id='line_1756'></a>
<a id='line_1757'>15:27 And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a she</a>

<a id='line_1761'>ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the LORD, to make an</a>
<a id='line_1762'>atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven him.</a>
<a id='line_1763'></a>
<a id='line_1764'>15:29 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance,</a>

<a id='line_1768'>15:30 But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be born</a>

<a id='line_1771'></a>
<a id='line_1772'>15:31 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken</a>

<a id='line_1781'></a>
<a id='line_1782'>15:34 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what</a>

<a id='line_1792'>15:37 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 15:38 Speak unto the</a>

<a id='line_1795'>put upon the fringe of the borders a ribband of blue: 15:39 And it</a>
<a id='line_1796'>shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember</a>
<a id='line_1797'>all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not</a>

<a id='line_1802'>15:41 I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of</a>

<a id='line_1825'>16:8 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:</a>
<a id='line_1826'>16:9 Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel</a>
<a id='line_1827'>hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near</a>
<a id='line_1828'>to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to</a>
<a id='line_1829'>stand before the congregation to minister unto them?  16:10 And he</a>
<a id='line_1830'>hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi</a>
<a id='line_1831'>with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?  16:11 For which cause</a>
<a id='line_1832'>both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD:</a>
<a id='line_1833'>and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him?  16:12 And Moses sent</a>
<a id='line_1834'>to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not</a>
<a id='line_1835'>come up: 16:13 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of</a>
<a id='line_1836'>a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness,</a>
<a id='line_1837'>except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us?  16:14 Moreover</a>
<a id='line_1838'>thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey,</a>
<a id='line_1839'>or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the</a>
<a id='line_1840'>eyes of these men? we will not come up.</a>
<a id='line_1841'></a>
<a id='line_1842'>16:15 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not</a>
<a id='line_1843'>thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have</a>
<a id='line_1844'>I hurt one of them.</a>
<a id='line_1845'></a>
<a id='line_1846'>16:16 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before</a>
<a id='line_1847'>the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow: 16:17 And take every</a>
<a id='line_1848'>man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1849'>every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and</a>
<a id='line_1850'>Aaron, each of you his censer.</a>
<a id='line_1851'></a>
<a id='line_1852'>16:18 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and</a>
<a id='line_1853'>laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_1854'>congregation with Moses and Aaron.</a>
<a id='line_1855'></a>
<a id='line_1856'>16:19 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the</a>
<a id='line_1857'>door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1858'>appeared unto all the congregation.</a>
<a id='line_1859'></a>
<a id='line_1860'>16:20 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 16:21</a>
<a id='line_1861'>Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume</a>
<a id='line_1862'>them in a moment.</a>
<a id='line_1863'></a>
<a id='line_1864'>16:22 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the</a>
<a id='line_1865'>spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with</a>
<a id='line_1866'>all the congregation?  16:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1867'>16:24 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the</a>
<a id='line_1868'>tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.</a>
<a id='line_1869'></a>
<a id='line_1870'>16:25 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the</a>
<a id='line_1871'>elders of Israel followed him.</a>
<a id='line_1872'></a>
<a id='line_1873'>16:26 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you,</a>
<a id='line_1874'>from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest</a>
<a id='line_1875'>ye be consumed in all their sins.</a>
<a id='line_1876'></a>
<a id='line_1877'>16:27 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,</a>
<a id='line_1878'>on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door</a>
<a id='line_1879'>of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little</a>
<a id='line_1880'>children.</a>
<a id='line_1881'></a>
<a id='line_1882'>16:28 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me</a>
<a id='line_1883'>to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind.</a>
<a id='line_1884'></a>
<a id='line_1885'>16:29 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be</a>
<a id='line_1886'>visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent</a>
<a id='line_1887'>me.</a>
<a id='line_1888'></a>
<a id='line_1889'>16:30 But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth,</a>
<a id='line_1890'>and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go</a>
<a id='line_1891'>down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have</a>
<a id='line_1892'>provoked the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1893'></a>
<a id='line_1894'>16:31 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these</a>
<a id='line_1895'>words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them: 16:32 And</a>
<a id='line_1896'>the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses,</a>
<a id='line_1897'>and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their goods.</a>
<a id='line_1898'></a>
<a id='line_1899'>16:33 They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the</a>
<a id='line_1900'>pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the</a>
<a id='line_1901'>congregation.</a>
<a id='line_1902'></a>
<a id='line_1903'>16:34 And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of</a>
<a id='line_1904'>them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.</a>
<a id='line_1905'></a>
<a id='line_1906'>16:35 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two</a>
<a id='line_1907'>hundred and fifty men that offered incense.</a>
<a id='line_1908'></a>
<a id='line_1909'>16:36 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:37 Speak unto Eleazar</a>
<a id='line_1910'>the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the</a>
<a id='line_1911'>burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed.</a>
<a id='line_1912'></a>
<a id='line_1913'>16:38 The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them</a>
<a id='line_1914'>make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered</a>
<a id='line_1915'>them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a</a>
<a id='line_1916'>sign unto the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1917'></a>
<a id='line_1918'>16:39 And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they</a>
<a id='line_1919'>that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a</a>
<a id='line_1920'>covering of the altar: 16:40 To be a memorial unto the children of</a>
<a id='line_1921'>Israel, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near</a>
<a id='line_1922'>to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as his</a>
<a id='line_1923'>company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.</a>
<a id='line_1924'></a>
<a id='line_1925'>16:41 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel</a>
<a id='line_1926'>murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the</a>
<a id='line_1927'>people of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1928'></a>
<a id='line_1929'>16:42 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against</a>
<a id='line_1930'>Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_1931'>congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the</a>
<a id='line_1932'>LORD appeared.</a>
<a id='line_1933'></a>
<a id='line_1934'>16:43 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_1935'>congregation.</a>
<a id='line_1936'></a>
<a id='line_1937'>16:44 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 16:45 Get you up from</a>
<a id='line_1938'>among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And</a>
<a id='line_1939'>they fell upon their faces.</a>
<a id='line_1940'></a>
<a id='line_1941'>16:46 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein</a>
<a id='line_1942'>from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the</a>
<a id='line_1943'>congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone</a>
<a id='line_1944'>out from the LORD; the plague is begun.</a>
<a id='line_1945'></a>
<a id='line_1946'>16:47 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_1947'>congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and</a>
<a id='line_1948'>he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.</a>
<a id='line_1949'></a>
<a id='line_1950'>16:48 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was</a>
<a id='line_1951'>stayed.</a>
<a id='line_1952'></a>
<a id='line_1953'>16:49 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and</a>
<a id='line_1954'>seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of Korah.</a>
<a id='line_1955'></a>
<a id='line_1956'>16:50 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of</a>
<a id='line_1957'>the congregation: and the plague was stayed.</a>
<a id='line_1958'></a>
<a id='line_1959'>17:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 17:2 Speak unto the</a>
<a id='line_1960'>children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to</a>
<a id='line_1961'>the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the</a>
<a id='line_1962'>house of their fathers twelve rods: write thou every manâ€™s name upon</a>
<a id='line_1963'>his rod.</a>
<a id='line_1964'></a>
<a id='line_1965'>17:3 And thou shalt write Aaronâ€™s name upon the rod of Levi: for one</a>
<a id='line_1966'>rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.</a>
<a id='line_1967'></a>
<a id='line_1968'>17:4 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation</a>
<a id='line_1969'>before the testimony, where I will meet with you.</a>
<a id='line_1970'></a>
<a id='line_1971'>17:5 And it shall come to pass, that the manâ€™s rod, whom I shall</a>
<a id='line_1972'>choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings</a>
<a id='line_1973'>of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.</a>
<a id='line_1974'></a>
<a id='line_1975'>17:6 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of</a>
<a id='line_1976'>their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to</a>
<a id='line_1977'>their fathersâ€™ houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was</a>
<a id='line_1978'>among their rods.</a>
<a id='line_1979'></a>
<a id='line_1980'>17:7 And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of</a>
<a id='line_1981'>witness.</a>
<a id='line_1982'></a>
<a id='line_1983'>17:8 And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the</a>
<a id='line_1984'>tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of</a>
<a id='line_1985'>Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and</a>
<a id='line_1986'>yielded almonds.</a>
<a id='line_1987'></a>
<a id='line_1988'>17:9 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto all</a>
<a id='line_1989'>the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.</a>
<a id='line_1990'></a>
<a id='line_1991'>17:10 And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaronâ€™s rod again before the</a>
<a id='line_1992'>testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_1993'>quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.</a>
<a id='line_1994'></a>
<a id='line_1995'>17:11 And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.</a>
<a id='line_1996'></a>
<a id='line_1997'>17:12 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold, we</a>
<a id='line_1998'>die, we perish, we all perish.</a>
<a id='line_1999'></a>
<a id='line_2000'>17:13 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2001'>shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?  18:1 And the LORD said</a>
<a id='line_2002'>unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy fatherâ€™s house with thee shall</a>
<a id='line_2003'>bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee</a>
<a id='line_2004'>shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.</a>
<a id='line_2005'></a>
<a id='line_2006'>18:2 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy</a>
<a id='line_2007'>father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto thee, and</a>
<a id='line_2008'>minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister</a>
<a id='line_2009'>before the tabernacle of witness.</a>
<a id='line_2010'></a>
<a id='line_2011'>18:3 And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the</a>
<a id='line_2012'>tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary</a>
<a id='line_2013'>and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.</a>
<a id='line_2014'></a>
<a id='line_2015'>18:4 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the</a>
<a id='line_2016'>tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the tabernacle:</a>
<a id='line_2017'>and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.</a>
<a id='line_2018'></a>
<a id='line_2019'>18:5 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of</a>
<a id='line_2020'>the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of</a>
<a id='line_2021'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2022'></a>
<a id='line_2023'>18:6 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among</a>
<a id='line_2024'>the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_2025'>to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.</a>
<a id='line_2026'></a>
<a id='line_2027'>18:7 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priestâ€™s</a>
<a id='line_2028'>office for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and ye shall</a>
<a id='line_2029'>serve: I have given your priestâ€™s office unto you as a service of</a>
<a id='line_2030'>gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.</a>
<a id='line_2031'></a>
<a id='line_2032'>18:8 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the</a>
<a id='line_2033'>charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things of the</a>
<a id='line_2034'>children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the</a>
<a id='line_2035'>anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever.</a>
<a id='line_2036'></a>
<a id='line_2037'>18:9 This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the</a>
<a id='line_2038'>fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and</a>
<a id='line_2039'>every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs</a>
<a id='line_2040'>which they shall render unto me, shall be most holy for thee and for</a>
<a id='line_2041'>thy sons.</a>
<a id='line_2042'></a>
<a id='line_2043'>18:10 In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat</a>
<a id='line_2044'>it: it shall be holy unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_2045'></a>
<a id='line_2046'>18:11 And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all</a>
<a id='line_2047'>the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given them unto</a>
<a id='line_2048'>thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with thee, by a statute for</a>
<a id='line_2049'>ever: every one that is clean in thy house shall eat of it.</a>
<a id='line_2050'></a>
<a id='line_2051'>18:12 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of</a>
<a id='line_2052'>the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the</a>
<a id='line_2053'>LORD, them have I given thee.</a>
<a id='line_2054'></a>
<a id='line_2055'>18:13 And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring</a>
<a id='line_2056'>unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house</a>
<a id='line_2057'>shall eat of it.</a>
<a id='line_2058'></a>
<a id='line_2059'>18:14 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.</a>
<a id='line_2060'></a>
<a id='line_2061'>18:15 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they</a>
<a id='line_2062'>bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be thine:</a>
<a id='line_2063'>nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely redeem, and the</a>
<a id='line_2064'>firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.</a>
<a id='line_2065'></a>
<a id='line_2066'>18:16 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou</a>
<a id='line_2067'>redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five shekels,</a>
<a id='line_2068'>after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs.</a>
<a id='line_2069'></a>
<a id='line_2070'>18:17 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or the</a>
<a id='line_2071'>firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy: thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_2072'>sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn their fat for an</a>
<a id='line_2073'>offering made by fire, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2074'></a>
<a id='line_2075'>18:18 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and as</a>
<a id='line_2076'>the right shoulder are thine.</a>
<a id='line_2077'></a>
<a id='line_2078'>18:19 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children</a>
<a id='line_2079'>of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons and thy</a>
<a id='line_2080'>daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a covenant of salt</a>
<a id='line_2081'>for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy seed with thee.</a>
<a id='line_2082'></a>
<a id='line_2083'>18:20 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance in</a>
<a id='line_2084'>their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I am thy part</a>
<a id='line_2085'>and thine inheritance among the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2086'></a>
<a id='line_2087'>18:21 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in</a>
<a id='line_2088'>Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even</a>
<a id='line_2089'>the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.</a>
<a id='line_2090'></a>
<a id='line_2091'>18:22 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the</a>
<a id='line_2092'>tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.</a>
<a id='line_2093'></a>
<a id='line_2094'>18:23 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_2095'>congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be a</a>
<a id='line_2096'>statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children</a>
<a id='line_2097'>of Israel they have no inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_2098'></a>
<a id='line_2099'>18:24 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as an</a>
<a id='line_2100'>heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites to inherit:</a>
<a id='line_2101'>therefore I have said unto them, Among the children of Israel they</a>
<a id='line_2102'>shall have no inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_2103'></a>
<a id='line_2104'>18:25 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 18:26 Thus speak unto the</a>
<a id='line_2105'>Levites, and say unto them, When ye take of the children of Israel the</a>
<a id='line_2106'>tithes which I have given you from them for your inheritance, then ye</a>
<a id='line_2107'>shall offer up an heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part</a>
<a id='line_2108'>of the tithe.</a>
<a id='line_2109'></a>
<a id='line_2110'>18:27 And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as</a>
<a id='line_2111'>though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of</a>
<a id='line_2112'>the winepress.</a>
<a id='line_2113'></a>
<a id='line_2114'>18:28 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of all</a>
<a id='line_2115'>your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel; and ye shall</a>
<a id='line_2116'>give thereof the LORDâ€™s heave offering to Aaron the priest.</a>
<a id='line_2117'></a>
<a id='line_2118'>18:29 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of the</a>
<a id='line_2119'>LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part thereof out of</a>
<a id='line_2120'>it.</a>
<a id='line_2121'></a>
<a id='line_2122'>18:30 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the best</a>
<a id='line_2123'>thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the Levites as the</a>
<a id='line_2124'>increase of the threshingfloor, and as the increase of the winepress.</a>
<a id='line_2125'></a>
<a id='line_2126'>18:31 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households: for</a>
<a id='line_2127'>it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the</a>

<a id='line_2130'>18:32 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved</a>

<a id='line_2132'>the children of Israel, lest ye die.</a>
<a id='line_2133'></a>
<a id='line_2134'>19:1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, 19:2 This</a>
<a id='line_2135'>is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying,</a>
<a id='line_2136'>Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer</a>
<a id='line_2137'>without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke:</a>
<a id='line_2138'>19:3 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring</a>

<a id='line_2141'>and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the</a>
<a id='line_2142'>congregation seven times: 19:5 And one shall burn the heifer in his</a>
<a id='line_2143'>sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he</a>
<a id='line_2144'>burn: 19:6 And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and</a>
<a id='line_2145'>scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.</a>
<a id='line_2146'></a>
<a id='line_2147'>19:7 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his</a>
<a id='line_2148'>flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the</a>
<a id='line_2149'>priest shall be unclean until the even.</a>
<a id='line_2150'></a>
<a id='line_2151'>19:8 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and</a>
<a id='line_2152'>bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.</a>
<a id='line_2153'></a>
<a id='line_2154'>19:9 And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer,</a>
<a id='line_2155'>and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be</a>
<a id='line_2156'>kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of</a>
<a id='line_2157'>separation: it is a purification for sin.</a>
<a id='line_2158'></a>
<a id='line_2159'>19:10 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his</a>
<a id='line_2160'>clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the</a>
<a id='line_2161'>children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them,</a>
<a id='line_2162'>for a statute for ever.</a>
<a id='line_2163'></a>
<a id='line_2164'>19:11 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven</a>

<a id='line_2166'></a>
<a id='line_2167'>19:12 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the</a>

<a id='line_2176'></a>
<a id='line_2177'>19:14 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into</a>

<a id='line_2192'>touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave: 19:19 And the</a>
<a id='line_2193'>clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on</a>
<a id='line_2194'>the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and</a>

<a id='line_2196'>even.</a>
<a id='line_2197'></a>
<a id='line_2198'>19:20 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself,</a>

<a id='line_2209'></a>
<a id='line_2210'>20:1 Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,</a>
<a id='line_2211'>into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in</a>
<a id='line_2212'>Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.</a>
<a id='line_2213'></a>
<a id='line_2214'>20:2 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered</a>
<a id='line_2215'>themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.</a>
<a id='line_2216'></a>
<a id='line_2217'>20:3 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God</a>
<a id='line_2218'>that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!  20:4 And why</a>
<a id='line_2219'>have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness,</a>
<a id='line_2220'>that we and our cattle should die there?  20:5 And wherefore have ye</a>
<a id='line_2221'>made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place?</a>
<a id='line_2222'>it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates;</a>
<a id='line_2223'>neither is there any water to drink.</a>
<a id='line_2224'></a>
<a id='line_2225'>20:6 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto</a>
<a id='line_2226'>the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon</a>
<a id='line_2227'>their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them.</a>
<a id='line_2228'></a>
<a id='line_2229'>20:7 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 20:8 Take the rod, and</a>
<a id='line_2230'>gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and</a>
<a id='line_2231'>speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his</a>
<a id='line_2232'>water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so</a>
<a id='line_2233'>thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.</a>
<a id='line_2234'></a>
<a id='line_2235'>20:9 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him.</a>
<a id='line_2236'></a>
<a id='line_2237'>20:10 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before</a>
<a id='line_2238'>the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch</a>
<a id='line_2239'>you water out of this rock?  20:11 And Moses lifted up his hand, and</a>
<a id='line_2240'>with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out</a>
<a id='line_2241'>abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also.</a>
<a id='line_2242'></a>
<a id='line_2243'>20:12 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me</a>
<a id='line_2244'>not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore</a>
<a id='line_2245'>ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given</a>
<a id='line_2246'>them.</a>
<a id='line_2247'></a>
<a id='line_2248'>20:13 This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel</a>
<a id='line_2249'>strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.</a>
<a id='line_2250'></a>
<a id='line_2251'>20:14 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,</a>
<a id='line_2252'>Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath</a>
<a id='line_2253'>befallen us: 20:15 How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have</a>
<a id='line_2254'>dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our</a>
<a id='line_2255'>fathers: 20:16 And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice,</a>
<a id='line_2256'>and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and,</a>
<a id='line_2257'>behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border: 20:17</a>
<a id='line_2258'>Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass</a>
<a id='line_2259'>through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of</a>
<a id='line_2260'>the water of the wells: we will go by the kingâ€™s high way, we will not</a>
<a id='line_2261'>turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy</a>
<a id='line_2262'>borders.</a>
<a id='line_2263'></a>
<a id='line_2264'>20:18 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come</a>
<a id='line_2265'>out against thee with the sword.</a>
<a id='line_2266'></a>
<a id='line_2267'>20:19 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high</a>
<a id='line_2268'>way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for</a>
<a id='line_2269'>it: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet.</a>
<a id='line_2270'></a>
<a id='line_2271'>20:20 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out</a>
<a id='line_2272'>against him with much people, and with a strong hand.</a>
<a id='line_2273'></a>
<a id='line_2274'>20:21 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:</a>
<a id='line_2275'>wherefore Israel turned away from him.</a>
<a id='line_2276'></a>
<a id='line_2277'>20:22 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,</a>
<a id='line_2278'>journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.</a>
<a id='line_2279'></a>
<a id='line_2280'>20:23 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the</a>
<a id='line_2281'>coast of the land of Edom, saying, 20:24 Aaron shall be gathered unto</a>
<a id='line_2282'>his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given</a>
<a id='line_2283'>unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at</a>
<a id='line_2284'>the water of Meribah.</a>
<a id='line_2285'></a>
<a id='line_2286'>20:25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount</a>
<a id='line_2287'>Hor: 20:26 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar</a>
<a id='line_2288'>his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die</a>
<a id='line_2289'>there.</a>
<a id='line_2290'></a>
<a id='line_2291'>20:27 And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount</a>
<a id='line_2292'>Hor in the sight of all the congregation.</a>
<a id='line_2293'></a>
<a id='line_2294'>20:28 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon</a>
<a id='line_2295'>Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and</a>
<a id='line_2296'>Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.</a>
<a id='line_2297'></a>
<a id='line_2298'>20:29 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they</a>
<a id='line_2299'>mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2300'></a>
<a id='line_2301'>21:1 And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard</a>
<a id='line_2302'>tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against</a>
<a id='line_2303'>Israel, and took some of them prisoners.</a>
<a id='line_2304'></a>
<a id='line_2305'>21:2 And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt</a>
<a id='line_2306'>indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy</a>
<a id='line_2307'>their cities.</a>
<a id='line_2308'></a>
<a id='line_2309'>21:3 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up</a>
<a id='line_2310'>the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and</a>
<a id='line_2311'>he called the name of the place Hormah.</a>
<a id='line_2312'></a>
<a id='line_2313'>21:4 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to</a>
<a id='line_2314'>compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much</a>
<a id='line_2315'>discouraged because of the way.</a>
<a id='line_2316'></a>
<a id='line_2317'>21:5 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore</a>
<a id='line_2318'>have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there</a>
<a id='line_2319'>is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this</a>
<a id='line_2320'>light bread.</a>
<a id='line_2321'></a>
<a id='line_2322'>21:6 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit</a>
<a id='line_2323'>the people; and much people of Israel died.</a>
<a id='line_2324'></a>
<a id='line_2325'>21:7 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for</a>
<a id='line_2326'>we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray unto the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_2327'>that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the</a>
<a id='line_2328'>people.</a>
<a id='line_2329'></a>
<a id='line_2330'>21:8 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set</a>
<a id='line_2331'>it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is</a>
<a id='line_2332'>bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.</a>
<a id='line_2333'></a>
<a id='line_2334'>21:9 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it</a>
<a id='line_2335'>came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the</a>
<a id='line_2336'>serpent of brass, he lived.</a>
<a id='line_2337'></a>
<a id='line_2338'>21:10 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.</a>
<a id='line_2339'></a>
<a id='line_2340'>21:11 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in the</a>
<a id='line_2341'>wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.</a>
<a id='line_2342'></a>
<a id='line_2343'>21:12 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.</a>
<a id='line_2344'></a>
<a id='line_2345'>21:13 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of</a>
<a id='line_2346'>Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the</a>
<a id='line_2347'>Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the</a>
<a id='line_2348'>Amorites.</a>
<a id='line_2349'></a>
<a id='line_2350'>21:14 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What</a>
<a id='line_2351'>he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, 21:15 And at the</a>
<a id='line_2352'>stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth</a>
<a id='line_2353'>upon the border of Moab.</a>
<a id='line_2354'></a>
<a id='line_2355'>21:16 And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the</a>
<a id='line_2356'>LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give</a>
<a id='line_2357'>them water.</a>
<a id='line_2358'></a>
<a id='line_2359'>21:17 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:</a>
<a id='line_2360'>21:18 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it,</a>
<a id='line_2361'>by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the</a>
<a id='line_2362'>wilderness they went to Mattanah: 21:19 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel:</a>
<a id='line_2363'>and from Nahaliel to Bamoth: 21:20 And from Bamoth in the valley, that</a>
<a id='line_2364'>is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward</a>
<a id='line_2365'>Jeshimon.</a>
<a id='line_2366'></a>
<a id='line_2367'>21:21 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,</a>
<a id='line_2368'>saying, 21:22 Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the</a>
<a id='line_2369'>fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the</a>
<a id='line_2370'>well: but we will go along by the kingâ€™s high way, until we be past</a>
<a id='line_2371'>thy borders.</a>
<a id='line_2372'></a>
<a id='line_2373'>21:23 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border:</a>
<a id='line_2374'>but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against</a>
<a id='line_2375'>Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against</a>
<a id='line_2376'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2377'></a>
<a id='line_2378'>21:24 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed</a>
<a id='line_2379'>his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for</a>
<a id='line_2380'>the border of the children of Ammon was strong.</a>
<a id='line_2381'></a>
<a id='line_2382'>21:25 And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the</a>
<a id='line_2383'>cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.</a>
<a id='line_2384'></a>
<a id='line_2385'>21:26 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who</a>
<a id='line_2386'>had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out</a>
<a id='line_2387'>of his hand, even unto Arnon.</a>
<a id='line_2388'></a>
<a id='line_2389'>21:27 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,</a>
<a id='line_2390'>let the city of Sihon be built and prepared: 21:28 For there is a fire</a>
<a id='line_2391'>gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed</a>
<a id='line_2392'>Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon.</a>
<a id='line_2393'></a>
<a id='line_2394'>21:29 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath</a>
<a id='line_2395'>given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity unto</a>
<a id='line_2396'>Sihon king of the Amorites.</a>
<a id='line_2397'></a>
<a id='line_2398'>21:30 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and</a>
<a id='line_2399'>we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.</a>
<a id='line_2400'></a>
<a id='line_2401'>21:31 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.</a>
<a id='line_2402'></a>
<a id='line_2403'>21:32 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages</a>
<a id='line_2404'>thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.</a>
<a id='line_2405'></a>
<a id='line_2406'>21:33 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the</a>
<a id='line_2407'>king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the</a>
<a id='line_2408'>battle at Edrei.</a>
<a id='line_2409'></a>
<a id='line_2410'>21:34 And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered</a>
<a id='line_2411'>him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do</a>
<a id='line_2412'>to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at</a>
<a id='line_2413'>Heshbon.</a>
<a id='line_2414'></a>
<a id='line_2415'>21:35 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there</a>
<a id='line_2416'>was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.</a>
<a id='line_2417'></a>
<a id='line_2418'>22:1 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains</a>
<a id='line_2419'>of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.</a>
<a id='line_2420'></a>
<a id='line_2421'>22:2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the</a>
<a id='line_2422'>Amorites.</a>
<a id='line_2423'></a>
<a id='line_2424'>22:3 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many:</a>
<a id='line_2425'>and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2426'></a>
<a id='line_2427'>22:4 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company</a>
<a id='line_2428'>lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of</a>
<a id='line_2429'>the field.</a>
<a id='line_2430'></a>
<a id='line_2431'>And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time.</a>
<a id='line_2432'></a>
<a id='line_2433'>22:5 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to</a>
<a id='line_2434'>Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his</a>
<a id='line_2435'>people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from</a>
<a id='line_2436'>Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over</a>
<a id='line_2437'>against me: 22:6 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this</a>
<a id='line_2438'>people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail,</a>
<a id='line_2439'>that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for</a>
<a id='line_2440'>I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest</a>
<a id='line_2441'>is cursed.</a>
<a id='line_2442'></a>
<a id='line_2443'>22:7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the</a>
<a id='line_2444'>rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and</a>
<a id='line_2445'>spake unto him the words of Balak.</a>
<a id='line_2446'></a>
<a id='line_2447'>22:8 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring</a>
<a id='line_2448'>you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of</a>
<a id='line_2449'>Moab abode with Balaam.</a>
<a id='line_2450'></a>
<a id='line_2451'>22:9 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?</a>
<a id='line_2452'>22:10 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab,</a>
<a id='line_2453'>hath sent unto me, saying, 22:11 Behold, there is a people come out of</a>
<a id='line_2454'>Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them;</a>
<a id='line_2455'>peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.</a>
<a id='line_2456'></a>
<a id='line_2457'>22:12 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou</a>
<a id='line_2458'>shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.</a>
<a id='line_2459'></a>
<a id='line_2460'>22:13 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of</a>
<a id='line_2461'>Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave</a>
<a id='line_2462'>to go with you.</a>
<a id='line_2463'></a>
<a id='line_2464'>22:14 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and</a>
<a id='line_2465'>said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.</a>
<a id='line_2466'></a>
<a id='line_2467'>22:15 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than</a>
<a id='line_2468'>they.</a>
<a id='line_2469'></a>
<a id='line_2470'>22:16 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the</a>
<a id='line_2471'>son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto</a>
<a id='line_2472'>me: 22:17 For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will</a>
<a id='line_2473'>do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse</a>
<a id='line_2474'>me this people.</a>
<a id='line_2475'></a>
<a id='line_2476'>22:18 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If</a>
<a id='line_2477'>Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go</a>
<a id='line_2478'>beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more.</a>
<a id='line_2479'></a>
<a id='line_2480'>22:19 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I</a>
<a id='line_2481'>may know what the LORD will say unto me more.</a>
<a id='line_2482'></a>
<a id='line_2483'>22:20 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men</a>
<a id='line_2484'>come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I</a>
<a id='line_2485'>shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.</a>
<a id='line_2486'></a>
<a id='line_2487'>22:21 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went</a>
<a id='line_2488'>with the princes of Moab.</a>
<a id='line_2489'></a>
<a id='line_2490'>22:22 And Godâ€™s anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of</a>
<a id='line_2491'>the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was</a>
<a id='line_2492'>riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.</a>
<a id='line_2493'></a>
<a id='line_2494'>22:23 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and</a>
<a id='line_2495'>his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way,</a>
<a id='line_2496'>and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into</a>
<a id='line_2497'>the way.</a>
<a id='line_2498'></a>
<a id='line_2499'>22:24 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a</a>
<a id='line_2500'>wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.</a>
<a id='line_2501'></a>
<a id='line_2502'>22:25 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself</a>
<a id='line_2503'>unto the wall, and crushed Balaamâ€™s foot against the wall: and he</a>
<a id='line_2504'>smote her again.</a>
<a id='line_2505'></a>
<a id='line_2506'>22:26 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow</a>
<a id='line_2507'>place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the</a>
<a id='line_2508'>left.</a>
<a id='line_2509'></a>
<a id='line_2510'>22:27 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under</a>
<a id='line_2511'>Balaam: and Balaamâ€™s anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a</a>
<a id='line_2512'>staff.</a>
<a id='line_2513'></a>
<a id='line_2514'>22:28 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto</a>
<a id='line_2515'>Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these</a>
<a id='line_2516'>three times?  22:29 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast</a>
<a id='line_2517'>mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I</a>
<a id='line_2518'>kill thee.</a>
<a id='line_2519'></a>
<a id='line_2520'>22:30 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which</a>
<a id='line_2521'>thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont</a>
<a id='line_2522'>to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.</a>
<a id='line_2523'></a>
<a id='line_2524'>22:31 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of</a>
<a id='line_2525'>the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he</a>
<a id='line_2526'>bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.</a>
<a id='line_2527'></a>
<a id='line_2528'>22:32 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou</a>
<a id='line_2529'>smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand</a>
<a id='line_2530'>thee, because thy way is perverse before me: 22:33 And the ass saw me,</a>
<a id='line_2531'>and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me,</a>
<a id='line_2532'>surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive.</a>
<a id='line_2533'></a>
<a id='line_2534'>22:34 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I</a>
<a id='line_2535'>knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if</a>
<a id='line_2536'>it displease thee, I will get me back again.</a>
<a id='line_2537'></a>
<a id='line_2538'>22:35 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but</a>
<a id='line_2539'>only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So</a>
<a id='line_2540'>Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</a>
<a id='line_2541'></a>
<a id='line_2542'>22:36 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet</a>
<a id='line_2543'>him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in</a>
<a id='line_2544'>the utmost coast.</a>
<a id='line_2545'></a>
<a id='line_2546'>22:37 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee</a>
<a id='line_2547'>to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed</a>
<a id='line_2548'>to promote thee to honour?  22:38 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am</a>
<a id='line_2549'>come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word</a>
<a id='line_2550'>that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.</a>
<a id='line_2551'></a>
<a id='line_2552'>22:39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.</a>
<a id='line_2553'></a>
<a id='line_2554'>22:40 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the</a>
<a id='line_2555'>princes that were with him.</a>
<a id='line_2556'></a>
<a id='line_2557'>22:41 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and</a>
<a id='line_2558'>brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see</a>
<a id='line_2559'>the utmost part of the people.</a>
<a id='line_2560'></a>
<a id='line_2561'>23:1 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and</a>
<a id='line_2562'>prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.</a>
<a id='line_2563'></a>
<a id='line_2564'>23:2 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered</a>
<a id='line_2565'>on every altar a bullock and a ram.</a>
<a id='line_2566'></a>
<a id='line_2567'>23:3 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I</a>
<a id='line_2568'>will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and whatsoever he</a>
<a id='line_2569'>sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.</a>
<a id='line_2570'></a>
<a id='line_2571'>23:4 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven</a>
<a id='line_2572'>altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.</a>
<a id='line_2573'></a>
<a id='line_2574'>23:5 And the LORD put a word in Balaamâ€™s mouth, and said, Return unto</a>
<a id='line_2575'>Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.</a>
<a id='line_2576'></a>
<a id='line_2577'>23:6 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt</a>
<a id='line_2578'>sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.</a>
<a id='line_2579'></a>
<a id='line_2580'>23:7 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath</a>
<a id='line_2581'>brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come,</a>
<a id='line_2582'>curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2583'></a>
<a id='line_2584'>23:8 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy,</a>
<a id='line_2585'>whom the LORD hath not defied?  23:9 For from the top of the rocks I</a>
<a id='line_2586'>see him, and from the hills I behold him: lo, the people shall dwell</a>
<a id='line_2587'>alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.</a>
<a id='line_2588'></a>
<a id='line_2589'>23:10 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth</a>
<a id='line_2590'>part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last</a>
<a id='line_2591'>end be like his!  23:11 And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou</a>
<a id='line_2592'>done unto me? I took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou</a>
<a id='line_2593'>hast blessed them altogether.</a>
<a id='line_2594'></a>
<a id='line_2595'>23:12 And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that</a>
<a id='line_2596'>which the LORD hath put in my mouth?  23:13 And Balak said unto him,</a>
<a id='line_2597'>Come, I pray thee, with me unto another place, from whence thou mayest</a>
<a id='line_2598'>see them: thou shalt see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not</a>
<a id='line_2599'>see them all: and curse me them from thence.</a>
<a id='line_2600'></a>
<a id='line_2601'>23:14 And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of</a>
<a id='line_2602'>Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on</a>
<a id='line_2603'>every altar.</a>
<a id='line_2604'></a>
<a id='line_2605'>23:15 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering, while</a>
<a id='line_2606'>I meet the LORD yonder.</a>
<a id='line_2607'></a>
<a id='line_2608'>23:16 And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said,</a>
<a id='line_2609'>Go again unto Balak, and say thus.</a>
<a id='line_2610'></a>
<a id='line_2611'>23:17 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt offering,</a>
<a id='line_2612'>and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath</a>
<a id='line_2613'>the LORD spoken?  23:18 And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up,</a>
<a id='line_2614'>Balak, and hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor: 23:19 God is not</a>
<a id='line_2615'>a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should</a>
<a id='line_2616'>repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he spoken, and</a>
<a id='line_2617'>shall he not make it good?  23:20 Behold, I have received commandment</a>
<a id='line_2618'>to bless: and he hath blessed; and I cannot reverse it.</a>
<a id='line_2619'></a>
<a id='line_2620'>23:21 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen</a>
<a id='line_2621'>perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the shout of</a>
<a id='line_2622'>a king is among them.</a>
<a id='line_2623'></a>
<a id='line_2624'>23:22 God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength</a>
<a id='line_2625'>of an unicorn.</a>
<a id='line_2626'></a>
<a id='line_2627'>23:23 Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there</a>
<a id='line_2628'>any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said</a>
<a id='line_2629'>of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!  23:24 Behold, the</a>
<a id='line_2630'>people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up himself as a young</a>
<a id='line_2631'>lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drink the</a>
<a id='line_2632'>blood of the slain.</a>
<a id='line_2633'></a>
<a id='line_2634'>23:25 And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless</a>
<a id='line_2635'>them at all.</a>
<a id='line_2636'></a>
<a id='line_2637'>23:26 But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee,</a>
<a id='line_2638'>saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?  23:27 And Balak</a>
<a id='line_2639'>said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee unto another</a>
<a id='line_2640'>place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest curse me them</a>
<a id='line_2641'>from thence.</a>
<a id='line_2642'></a>
<a id='line_2643'>23:28 And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh</a>
<a id='line_2644'>toward Jeshimon.</a>
<a id='line_2645'></a>
<a id='line_2646'>23:29 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and</a>
<a id='line_2647'>prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.</a>
<a id='line_2648'></a>
<a id='line_2649'>23:30 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a</a>
<a id='line_2650'>ram on every altar.</a>
<a id='line_2651'></a>
<a id='line_2652'>24:1 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he</a>
<a id='line_2653'>went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his</a>
<a id='line_2654'>face toward the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_2655'></a>
<a id='line_2656'>24:2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his</a>
<a id='line_2657'>tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God came upon him.</a>
<a id='line_2658'></a>
<a id='line_2659'>24:3 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath</a>
<a id='line_2660'>said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 24:4 He hath said,</a>
<a id='line_2661'>which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty,</a>
<a id='line_2662'>falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: 24:5 How goodly are</a>
<a id='line_2663'>thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!  24:6 As the</a>
<a id='line_2664'>valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the riverâ€™s side, as the</a>
<a id='line_2665'>trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath planted, and as cedar trees</a>
<a id='line_2666'>beside the waters.</a>
<a id='line_2667'></a>
<a id='line_2668'>24:7 He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be</a>
<a id='line_2669'>in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his</a>
<a id='line_2670'>kingdom shall be exalted.</a>
<a id='line_2671'></a>
<a id='line_2672'>24:8 God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the</a>
<a id='line_2673'>strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and</a>
<a id='line_2674'>shall break their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.</a>
<a id='line_2675'></a>
<a id='line_2676'>24:9 He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall</a>
<a id='line_2677'>stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that</a>
<a id='line_2678'>curseth thee.</a>
<a id='line_2679'></a>
<a id='line_2680'>24:10 And Balakâ€™s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his</a>
<a id='line_2681'>hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse</a>
<a id='line_2682'>mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these</a>
<a id='line_2683'>three times.</a>
<a id='line_2684'></a>
<a id='line_2685'>24:11 Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee</a>
<a id='line_2686'>unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honour.</a>
<a id='line_2687'></a>
<a id='line_2688'>24:12 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers</a>
<a id='line_2689'>which thou sentest unto me, saying, 24:13 If Balak would give me his</a>
<a id='line_2690'>house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the commandment of</a>
<a id='line_2691'>the LORD, to do either good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2692'>saith, that will I speak?  24:14 And now, behold, I go unto my people:</a>
<a id='line_2693'>come therefore, and I will advertise thee what this people shall do to</a>
<a id='line_2694'>thy people in the latter days.</a>
<a id='line_2695'></a>
<a id='line_2696'>24:15 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor</a>
<a id='line_2697'>hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: 24:16 He hath</a>
<a id='line_2698'>said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the most</a>
<a id='line_2699'>High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but</a>
<a id='line_2700'>having his eyes open: 24:17 I shall see him, but not now: I shall</a>
<a id='line_2701'>behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a</a>
<a id='line_2702'>Sceptre shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab,</a>
<a id='line_2703'>and destroy all the children of Sheth.</a>
<a id='line_2704'></a>
<a id='line_2705'>24:18 And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession</a>
<a id='line_2706'>for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.</a>
<a id='line_2707'></a>
<a id='line_2708'>24:19 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall</a>
<a id='line_2709'>destroy him that remaineth of the city.</a>
<a id='line_2710'></a>
<a id='line_2711'>24:20 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said,</a>
<a id='line_2712'>Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that</a>
<a id='line_2713'>he perish for ever.</a>
<a id='line_2714'></a>
<a id='line_2715'>24:21 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said,</a>
<a id='line_2716'>Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock.</a>
<a id='line_2717'></a>
<a id='line_2718'>24:22 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall</a>
<a id='line_2719'>carry thee away captive.</a>
<a id='line_2720'></a>

<a id='line_3316'>thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.</a>
<a id='line_3317'></a>
<a id='line_3318'>31:6 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them</a>
<a id='line_3319'>and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy</a>
<a id='line_3320'>instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.</a>
<a id='line_3321'></a>
<a id='line_3322'>31:7 And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded</a>
<a id='line_3323'>Moses; and they slew all the males.</a>
<a id='line_3324'></a>
<a id='line_3325'>31:8 And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that</a>
<a id='line_3326'>were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five</a>
<a id='line_3327'>kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.</a>
<a id='line_3328'></a>
<a id='line_3329'>31:9 And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives,</a>
<a id='line_3330'>and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all</a>
<a id='line_3331'>their flocks, and all their goods.</a>
<a id='line_3332'></a>
<a id='line_3333'>31:10 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all</a>
<a id='line_3334'>their goodly castles, with fire.</a>
<a id='line_3335'></a>
<a id='line_3336'>31:11 And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and</a>
<a id='line_3337'>of beasts.</a>
<a id='line_3338'></a>
<a id='line_3339'>31:12 And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto</a>
<a id='line_3340'>Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the</a>
<a id='line_3341'>children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by</a>
<a id='line_3342'>Jordan near Jericho.</a>
<a id='line_3343'></a>
<a id='line_3344'>31:13 And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the</a>
<a id='line_3345'>congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.</a>
<a id='line_3346'></a>
<a id='line_3347'>31:14 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the</a>
<a id='line_3348'>captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from</a>
<a id='line_3349'>the battle.</a>
<a id='line_3350'></a>
<a id='line_3351'>31:15 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?</a>
<a id='line_3352'>31:16 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel</a>
<a id='line_3353'>of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor,</a>
<a id='line_3354'>and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3355'></a>
<a id='line_3356'>31:17 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill</a>
<a id='line_3357'>every woman that hath known man by lying with him.</a>
<a id='line_3358'></a>
<a id='line_3359'>31:18 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying</a>
<a id='line_3360'>with him, keep alive for yourselves.</a>
<a id='line_3361'></a>
<a id='line_3362'>31:19 And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath</a>
<a id='line_3363'>killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both</a>
<a id='line_3364'>yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.</a>
<a id='line_3365'></a>
<a id='line_3366'>31:20 And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and</a>
<a id='line_3367'>all work of goatsâ€™ hair, and all things made of wood.</a>
<a id='line_3368'></a>
<a id='line_3369'>31:21 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to</a>
<a id='line_3370'>the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded</a>
<a id='line_3371'>Moses; 31:22 Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the</a>
<a id='line_3372'>tin, and the lead, 31:23 Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_3373'>make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it</a>
<a id='line_3374'>shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth</a>
<a id='line_3375'>not the fire ye shall make go through the water.</a>
<a id='line_3376'></a>
<a id='line_3377'>31:24 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall</a>
<a id='line_3378'>be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.</a>
<a id='line_3379'></a>
<a id='line_3380'>31:25 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, 31:26 Take the sum of the</a>
<a id='line_3381'>prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the</a>
<a id='line_3382'>priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation: 31:27 And divide</a>
<a id='line_3383'>the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who</a>
<a id='line_3384'>went out to battle, and between all the congregation: 31:28 And levy a</a>
<a id='line_3385'>tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one</a>
<a id='line_3386'>soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of</a>
<a id='line_3387'>the asses, and of the sheep: 31:29 Take it of their half, and give it</a>
<a id='line_3388'>unto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3389'></a>
<a id='line_3390'>31:30 And of the children of Israelâ€™s half, thou shalt take one</a>
<a id='line_3391'>portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of</a>
<a id='line_3392'>the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites,</a>
<a id='line_3393'>which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3394'></a>
<a id='line_3395'>31:31 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded</a>
<a id='line_3396'>Moses.</a>
<a id='line_3397'></a>
<a id='line_3398'>31:32 And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war</a>
<a id='line_3399'>had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five</a>
<a id='line_3400'>thousand sheep, 31:33 And threescore and twelve thousand beeves, 31:34</a>
<a id='line_3401'>And threescore and one thousand asses, 31:35 And thirty and two</a>
<a id='line_3402'>thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with</a>
<a id='line_3403'>him.</a>
<a id='line_3404'></a>
<a id='line_3405'>31:36 And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to</a>
<a id='line_3406'>war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty</a>
<a id='line_3407'>thousand and five hundred sheep: 31:37 And the LORDâ€™s tribute of the</a>
<a id='line_3408'>sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen.</a>
<a id='line_3409'></a>
<a id='line_3410'>31:38 And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORDâ€™s</a>
<a id='line_3411'>tribute was threescore and twelve.</a>
<a id='line_3412'></a>
<a id='line_3413'>31:39 And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which</a>
<a id='line_3414'>the LORDâ€™s tribute was threescore and one.</a>
<a id='line_3415'></a>
<a id='line_3416'>31:40 And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORDâ€™s</a>
<a id='line_3417'>tribute was thirty and two persons.</a>
<a id='line_3418'></a>
<a id='line_3419'>31:41 And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORDâ€™s heave offering,</a>
<a id='line_3420'>unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_3421'></a>
<a id='line_3422'>31:42 And of the children of Israelâ€™s half, which Moses divided from</a>
<a id='line_3423'>the men that warred, 31:43 (Now the half that pertained unto the</a>
<a id='line_3424'>congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven</a>
<a id='line_3425'>thousand and five hundred sheep, 31:44 And thirty and six thousand</a>
<a id='line_3426'>beeves, 31:45 And thirty thousand asses and five hundred, 31:46 And</a>
<a id='line_3427'>sixteen thousand persons;) 31:47 Even of the children of Israelâ€™s</a>
<a id='line_3428'>half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and</a>
<a id='line_3429'>gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of</a>
<a id='line_3430'>the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.</a>
<a id='line_3431'></a>
<a id='line_3432'>31:48 And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the</a>
<a id='line_3433'>captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:</a>
<a id='line_3434'>31:49 And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the</a>
<a id='line_3435'>men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man</a>
<a id='line_3436'>of us.</a>
<a id='line_3437'></a>
<a id='line_3438'>31:50 We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every</a>
<a id='line_3439'>man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings,</a>
<a id='line_3440'>earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the</a>
<a id='line_3441'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3442'></a>
<a id='line_3443'>31:51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all</a>
<a id='line_3444'>wrought jewels.</a>
<a id='line_3445'></a>
<a id='line_3446'>31:52 And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the</a>
<a id='line_3447'>LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds,</a>
<a id='line_3448'>was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.</a>
<a id='line_3449'></a>
<a id='line_3450'>31:53 (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)</a>
<a id='line_3451'>31:54 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains</a>
<a id='line_3452'>of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of</a>
<a id='line_3453'>the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the</a>
<a id='line_3454'>LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3455'></a>
<a id='line_3456'>32:1 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very</a>
<a id='line_3457'>great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and</a>
<a id='line_3458'>the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;</a>
<a id='line_3459'>32:2 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake</a>
<a id='line_3460'>unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the</a>
<a id='line_3461'>congregation, saying, 32:3 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah,</a>
<a id='line_3462'>and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon, 32:4 Even</a>
<a id='line_3463'>the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is</a>
<a id='line_3464'>a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle: 32:5 Wherefore, said</a>
<a id='line_3465'>they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given unto</a>
<a id='line_3466'>thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_3467'></a>
<a id='line_3468'>32:6 And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of</a>
<a id='line_3469'>Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?  32:7</a>
<a id='line_3470'>And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from</a>
<a id='line_3471'>going over into the land which the LORD hath given them?  32:8 Thus</a>
<a id='line_3472'>did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to see the land.</a>
<a id='line_3473'></a>
<a id='line_3474'>32:9 For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the</a>
<a id='line_3475'>land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they</a>
<a id='line_3476'>should not go into the land which the LORD had given them.</a>
<a id='line_3477'></a>
<a id='line_3478'>32:10 And the LORDâ€™s anger was kindled the same time, and he sware,</a>
<a id='line_3479'>saying, 32:11 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from</a>
<a id='line_3480'>twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto</a>
<a id='line_3481'>Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not wholly</a>
<a id='line_3482'>followed me: 32:12 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and</a>
<a id='line_3483'>Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3484'></a>
<a id='line_3485'>32:13 And the LORDâ€™s anger was kindled against Israel, and he made</a>
<a id='line_3486'>them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation,</a>
<a id='line_3487'>that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was consumed.</a>
<a id='line_3488'></a>
<a id='line_3489'>32:14 And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathersâ€™ stead, an increase</a>
<a id='line_3490'>of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD toward</a>
<a id='line_3491'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_3492'></a>
<a id='line_3493'>32:15 For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them</a>
<a id='line_3494'>in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.</a>
<a id='line_3495'></a>
<a id='line_3496'>32:16 And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds</a>
<a id='line_3497'>here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones: 32:17 But we</a>
<a id='line_3498'>ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we</a>
<a id='line_3499'>have brought them unto their place: and our little ones shall dwell in</a>
<a id='line_3500'>the fenced cities because of the inhabitants of the land.</a>
<a id='line_3501'></a>
<a id='line_3502'>32:18 We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel</a>
<a id='line_3503'>have inherited every man his inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_3504'></a>
<a id='line_3505'>32:19 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or</a>
<a id='line_3506'>forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan</a>
<a id='line_3507'>eastward.</a>
<a id='line_3508'></a>
<a id='line_3509'>32:20 And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will</a>
<a id='line_3510'>go armed before the LORD to war, 32:21 And will go all of you armed</a>
<a id='line_3511'>over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from</a>
<a id='line_3512'>before him, 32:22 And the land be subdued before the LORD: then</a>
<a id='line_3513'>afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_3514'>before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_3515'></a>
<a id='line_3516'>32:23 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the</a>
<a id='line_3517'>LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.</a>
<a id='line_3518'></a>
<a id='line_3519'>32:24 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep;</a>
<a id='line_3520'>and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.</a>
<a id='line_3521'></a>
<a id='line_3522'>32:25 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto</a>
<a id='line_3523'>Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.</a>
<a id='line_3524'></a>
<a id='line_3525'>32:26 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle,</a>
<a id='line_3526'>shall be there in the cities of Gilead: 32:27 But thy servants will</a>
<a id='line_3527'>pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my</a>
<a id='line_3528'>lord saith.</a>
<a id='line_3529'></a>
<a id='line_3530'>32:28 So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and</a>
<a id='line_3531'>Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the</a>
<a id='line_3532'>children of Israel: 32:29 And Moses said unto them, If the children of</a>
<a id='line_3533'>Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every</a>
<a id='line_3534'>man armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued</a>
<a id='line_3535'>before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a</a>
<a id='line_3536'>possession: 32:30 But if they will not pass over with you armed, they</a>
<a id='line_3537'>shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.</a>
<a id='line_3538'></a>
<a id='line_3539'>32:31 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered,</a>
<a id='line_3540'>saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.</a>
<a id='line_3541'></a>
<a id='line_3542'>32:32 We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan,</a>
<a id='line_3543'>that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be</a>
<a id='line_3544'>ours.</a>
<a id='line_3545'></a>
<a id='line_3546'>32:33 And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to</a>
<a id='line_3547'>the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of</a>
<a id='line_3548'>Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_3549'>Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts,</a>
<a id='line_3550'>even the cities of the country round about.</a>
<a id='line_3551'></a>
<a id='line_3552'>32:34 And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,</a>
<a id='line_3553'>32:35 And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah, 32:36 And</a>
<a id='line_3554'>Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for sheep.</a>
<a id='line_3555'></a>
<a id='line_3556'>32:37 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and</a>
<a id='line_3557'>Kirjathaim, 32:38 And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,)</a>
<a id='line_3558'>and Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.</a>
<a id='line_3559'></a>
<a id='line_3560'>32:39 And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead,</a>
<a id='line_3561'>and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.</a>
<a id='line_3562'></a>
<a id='line_3563'>32:40 And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he</a>
<a id='line_3564'>dwelt therein.</a>
<a id='line_3565'></a>
<a id='line_3566'>32:41 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns</a>
<a id='line_3567'>thereof, and called them Havothjair.</a>
<a id='line_3568'></a>
<a id='line_3569'>32:42 And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and</a>
<a id='line_3570'>called it Nobah, after his own name.</a>
<a id='line_3571'></a>
<a id='line_3572'>33:1 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went</a>
<a id='line_3573'>forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of</a>
<a id='line_3574'>Moses and Aaron.</a>
<a id='line_3575'></a>
<a id='line_3576'>33:2 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by</a>
<a id='line_3577'>the commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys according to</a>
<a id='line_3578'>their goings out.</a>
<a id='line_3579'></a>
<a id='line_3580'>33:3 And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the</a>
<a id='line_3581'>fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the</a>
<a id='line_3582'>children of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the</a>
<a id='line_3583'>Egyptians.</a>
<a id='line_3584'></a>
<a id='line_3585'>33:4 For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD had</a>
<a id='line_3586'>smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments.</a>
<a id='line_3587'></a>
<a id='line_3588'>33:5 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in</a>
<a id='line_3589'>Succoth.</a>
<a id='line_3590'></a>
<a id='line_3591'>33:6 And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in</a>
<a id='line_3592'>the edge of the wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_3593'></a>
<a id='line_3594'>33:7 And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth,</a>
<a id='line_3595'>which is before Baalzephon: and they pitched before Migdol.</a>
<a id='line_3596'></a>
<a id='line_3597'>33:8 And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed through the</a>
<a id='line_3598'>midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three daysâ€™ journey in</a>
<a id='line_3599'>the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.</a>
<a id='line_3600'></a>
<a id='line_3601'>33:9 And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were</a>
<a id='line_3602'>twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm trees; and they</a>
<a id='line_3603'>pitched there.</a>
<a id='line_3604'></a>
<a id='line_3605'>33:10 And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.</a>
<a id='line_3606'></a>
<a id='line_3607'>33:11 And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the</a>
<a id='line_3608'>wilderness of Sin.</a>
<a id='line_3609'></a>
<a id='line_3610'>33:12 And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and</a>

<a id='line_3860'>35:17 And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may die,</a>

<a id='line_3863'></a>
<a id='line_3864'>35:18 Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he may</a>

<a id='line_3880'>die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm: 35:24 Then the</a>
<a id='line_3881'>congregation shall judge between the slayer and the revenger of blood</a>
<a id='line_3882'>according to these judgments: 35:25 And the congregation shall deliver</a>

<a id='line_3887'></a>
<a id='line_3888'>35:26 But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of</a>

<a id='line_3891'>revenger of blood kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood:</a>
<a id='line_3892'>35:28 Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until</a>

<a id='line_3895'></a>
<a id='line_3896'>35:29 So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you</a>

<a id='line_3902'></a>
<a id='line_3903'>35:31 Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a</a>

<a id='line_3906'></a>
<a id='line_3907'>35:32 And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the</a>

<a id='line_3920'>Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the</a>
<a id='line_3921'>chief fathers of the children of Israel: 36:2 And they said, The LORD</a>
<a id='line_3922'>commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the</a>
<a id='line_3923'>children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the</a>
<a id='line_3924'>inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.</a>
<a id='line_3925'></a>
<a id='line_3926'>36:3 And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of</a>
<a id='line_3927'>the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the</a>
<a id='line_3928'>inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the</a>
<a id='line_3929'>tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot</a>

<a id='line_3931'></a>
<a id='line_3932'>36:4 And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then</a>

<a id='line_3935'>from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.</a>
<a id='line_3936'></a>
<a id='line_3937'>36:5 And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word</a>
<a id='line_3938'>of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.</a>
<a id='line_3939'></a>
<a id='line_3940'>36:6 This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the</a>
<a id='line_3941'>daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think</a>
<a id='line_3942'>best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they</a>
<a id='line_3943'>marry.</a>
<a id='line_3944'></a>
<a id='line_3945'>36:7 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove</a>

<a id='line_3947'>keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.</a>
<a id='line_3948'></a>
<a id='line_3949'>36:8 And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe</a>
<a id='line_3950'>of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the</a>

<a id='line_3953'></a>
<a id='line_3954'>36:9 Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another</a>

<a id='line_3956'>keep himself to his own inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_3957'></a>
<a id='line_3958'>36:10 Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of</a>
<a id='line_3959'>Zelophehad: 36:11 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and</a>
<a id='line_3960'>Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their fatherâ€™s</a>
<a id='line_3961'>brothersâ€™ sons: 36:12 And they were married into the families of the</a>
