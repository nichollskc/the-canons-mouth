<a id='line_9'>      The restoration of the Western empire by Charlemagne was speedily</a>
<a id='line_10'>      followed by the separation of the Greek and Latin churches. 1 A</a>
<a id='line_11'>      religious and national animosity still divides the two largest</a>
<a id='line_12'>      communions of the Christian world; and the schism of</a>
<a id='line_13'>      Constantinople,</a>
<a id='line_14'></a>
<a id='line_15'>       by alienating her most useful allies, and provoking her most</a>
<a id='line_16'>       dangerous</a>
<a id='line_17'></a>
<a id='line_18'>      enemies, has precipitated the decline and fall of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_19'>      empire in the East.</a>

<a id='line_21'>      1 (return) [ In the successive centuries, from the ixth to the</a>
<a id='line_22'>      xviiith, Mosheim traces the schism of the Greeks with learning,</a>

<a id='line_26'></a>
<a id='line_27'>      In the course of the present History, the aversion of the Greeks</a>
<a id='line_28'>      for the Latins has been often visible and conspicuous. It was</a>
<a id='line_29'>      originally derived from the disdain of servitude, inflamed, after</a>
<a id='line_30'>      the time of Constantine, by the pride of equality or dominion;</a>
<a id='line_31'>      and finally exasperated by the preference which their rebellious</a>
<a id='line_32'>      subjects had given to the alliance of the Franks. In every age</a>
<a id='line_33'>      the Greeks were proud of their superiority in profane and</a>
<a id='line_34'>      religious knowledge: they had first received the light of</a>
<a id='line_35'>      Christianity; they had pronounced the decrees of the seven</a>
<a id='line_36'>      general councils; they alone possessed the language of Scripture</a>
<a id='line_37'>      and philosophy; nor should the Barbarians, immersed in the</a>
<a id='line_38'>      darkness of the West, 2 presume to argue on the high and</a>
<a id='line_39'>      mysterious questions of theological science. Those Barbarians</a>
<a id='line_40'>      despised in then turn the restless and subtile levity of the</a>
<a id='line_41'>      Orientals, the authors of every heresy; and blessed their own</a>
<a id='line_42'>      simplicity, which was content to hold the tradition of the</a>
<a id='line_43'>      apostolic church. Yet in the seventh century, the synods of</a>
<a id='line_44'>      Spain, and afterwards of France, improved or corrupted the Nicene</a>
<a id='line_45'>      creed, on the mysterious subject of the third person of the</a>
<a id='line_46'>      Trinity. 3 In the long controversies of the East, the nature and</a>
<a id='line_47'>      generation of the Christ had been scrupulously defined; and the</a>
<a id='line_48'>      well-known relation of father and son seemed to convey a faint</a>
<a id='line_49'>      image to the human mind. The idea of birth was less analogous to</a>
<a id='line_50'>      the Holy Spirit, who, instead of a divine gift or attribute, was</a>
<a id='line_51'>      considered by the Catholics as a substance, a person, a god; he</a>
<a id='line_52'>      was not begotten, but in the orthodox style he _proceeded_. Did</a>
<a id='line_53'>      he proceed from the Father alone, perhaps _by_ the Son? or from</a>
<a id='line_54'>      the Father _and_ the Son? The first of these opinions was</a>
<a id='line_55'>      asserted by the Greeks, the second by the Latins; and the</a>
<a id='line_56'>      addition to the Nicene creed of the word _filioque_, kindled the</a>
<a id='line_57'>      flame of discord between the Oriental and the Gallic churches. In</a>
<a id='line_58'>      the origin of the disputes the Roman pontiffs affected a</a>
<a id='line_59'>      character of neutrality and moderation: 4 they condemned the</a>
<a id='line_60'>      innovation, but they acquiesced in the sentiment, of their</a>
<a id='line_61'>      Transalpine brethren: they seemed desirous of casting a veil of</a>
<a id='line_62'>      silence and charity over the superfluous research; and in the</a>
<a id='line_63'>      correspondence of Charlemagne and Leo the Third, the pope assumes</a>
<a id='line_64'>      the liberality of a statesman, and the prince descends to the</a>
<a id='line_65'>      passions and prejudices of a priest. 5 But the orthodoxy of Rome</a>
<a id='line_66'>      spontaneously obeyed the impulse of the temporal policy; and the</a>
<a id='line_67'>      _filioque_, which Leo wished to erase, was transcribed in the</a>
<a id='line_68'>      symbol and chanted in the liturgy of the Vatican. The Nicene and</a>
<a id='line_69'>      Athanasian creeds are held as the Catholic faith, without which</a>
<a id='line_70'>      none can be saved; and both Papists and Protestants must now</a>
<a id='line_71'>      sustain and return the anathemas of the Greeks, who deny the</a>
<a id='line_72'>      procession of the Holy Ghost from the Son, as well as from the</a>
<a id='line_73'>      Father. Such articles of faith are not susceptible of treaty; but</a>
<a id='line_74'>      the rules of discipline will vary in remote and independent</a>
<a id='line_75'>      churches; and the reason, even of divines, might allow, that the</a>
<a id='line_76'>      difference is inevitable and harmless. The craft or superstition</a>
<a id='line_77'>      of Rome has imposed on her priests and deacons the rigid</a>
<a id='line_78'>      obligation of celibacy; among the Greeks it is confined to the</a>
<a id='line_79'>      bishops; the loss is compensated by dignity or annihilated by</a>
<a id='line_80'>      age; and the parochial clergy, the papas, enjoy the conjugal</a>
<a id='line_81'>      society of the wives whom they have married before their entrance</a>
<a id='line_82'>      into holy orders. A question concerning the _Azyms_ was fiercely</a>
<a id='line_83'>      debated in the eleventh century, and the essence of the Eucharist</a>
<a id='line_84'>      was supposed in the East and West to depend on the use of</a>
<a id='line_85'>      leavened or unleavened bread. Shall I mention in a serious</a>
<a id='line_86'>      history the furious reproaches that were urged against the</a>
<a id='line_87'>      Latins, who for a long while remained on the defensive? They</a>
<a id='line_88'>      neglected to abstain, according to the apostolical decree, from</a>
<a id='line_89'>      things strangled, and from blood: they fasted (a Jewish</a>
<a id='line_90'>      observance!) on the Saturday of each week: during the first week</a>
<a id='line_91'>      of Lent they permitted the use of milk and cheese; 6 their infirm</a>
<a id='line_92'>      monks were indulged in the taste of flesh; and animal grease was</a>
<a id='line_93'>      substituted for the want of vegetable oil: the holy chrism or</a>
<a id='line_94'>      unction in baptism was reserved to the episcopal order: the</a>
<a id='line_95'>      bishops, as the bridegrooms of their churches, were decorated</a>
<a id='line_96'>      with rings; their priests shaved their faces, and baptized by a</a>
<a id='line_97'>      single immersion. Such were the crimes which provoked the zeal of</a>
<a id='line_98'>      the patriarchs of Constantinople; and which were justified with</a>
<a id='line_99'>      equal zeal by the doctors of the Latin church. 7</a>

<a id='line_139'>      Bigotry and national aversion are powerful magnifiers of every</a>
<a id='line_140'>      object of dispute; but the immediate cause of the schism of the</a>
<a id='line_141'>      Greeks may be traced in the emulation of the leading prelates,</a>
<a id='line_142'>      who maintained the supremacy of the old metropolis superior to</a>
<a id='line_143'>      all, and of the reigning capital, inferior to none, in the</a>
<a id='line_144'>      Christian world. About the middle of the ninth century, Photius,</a>
<a id='line_145'>      8 an ambitious layman, the captain of the guards and principal</a>
<a id='line_146'>      secretary, was promoted by merit and favor to the more desirable</a>
<a id='line_147'>      office of patriarch of Constantinople. In science, even</a>
<a id='line_148'>      ecclesiastical science, he surpassed the clergy of the age; and</a>
<a id='line_149'>      the purity of his morals has never been impeached: but his</a>
<a id='line_150'>      ordination was hasty, his rise was irregular; and Ignatius, his</a>
<a id='line_151'>      abdicated predecessor, was yet supported by the public compassion</a>
<a id='line_152'>      and the obstinacy of his adherents. They appealed to the tribunal</a>
<a id='line_153'>      of Nicholas the First, one of the proudest and most aspiring of</a>
<a id='line_154'>      the Roman pontiffs, who embraced the welcome opportunity of</a>
<a id='line_155'>      judging and condemning his rival of the East. Their quarrel was</a>
<a id='line_156'>      embittered by a conflict of jurisdiction over the king and nation</a>
<a id='line_157'>      of the Bulgarians; nor was their recent conversion to</a>
<a id='line_158'>      Christianity of much avail to either prelate, unless he could</a>
<a id='line_159'>      number the proselytes among the subjects of his power. With the</a>
<a id='line_160'>      aid of his court the Greek patriarch was victorious; but in the</a>
<a id='line_161'>      furious contest he deposed in his turn the successor of St.</a>
<a id='line_162'>      Peter, and involved the Latin church in the reproach of heresy</a>
<a id='line_163'>      and schism. Photius sacrificed the peace of the world to a short</a>
<a id='line_164'>      and precarious reign: he fell with his patron, the Cæsar Bardas;</a>
<a id='line_165'>      and Basil the Macedonian performed an act of justice in the</a>
<a id='line_166'>      restoration of Ignatius, whose age and dignity had not been</a>
<a id='line_167'>      sufficiently respected. From his monastery, or prison, Photius</a>
<a id='line_168'>      solicited the favor of the emperor by pathetic complaints and</a>
<a id='line_169'>      artful flattery; and the eyes of his rival were scarcely closed,</a>
<a id='line_170'>      when he was again restored to the throne of Constantinople. After</a>
<a id='line_171'>      the death of Basil he experienced the vicissitudes of courts and</a>
<a id='line_172'>      the ingratitude of a royal pupil: the patriarch was again</a>
<a id='line_173'>      deposed, and in his last solitary hours he might regret the</a>
<a id='line_174'>      freedom of a secular and studious life. In each revolution, the</a>
<a id='line_175'>      breath, the nod, of the sovereign had been accepted by a</a>
<a id='line_176'>      submissive clergy; and a synod of three hundred bishops was</a>
<a id='line_177'>      always prepared to hail the triumph, or to stigmatize the fall,</a>
<a id='line_178'>      of the holy, or the execrable, Photius. 9 By a delusive promise</a>
<a id='line_179'>      of succor or reward, the popes were tempted to countenance these</a>
<a id='line_180'>      various proceedings; and the synods of Constantinople were</a>
<a id='line_181'>      ratified by their epistles or legates. But the court and the</a>
<a id='line_182'>      people, Ignatius and Photius, were equally adverse to their</a>
<a id='line_183'>      claims; their ministers were insulted or imprisoned; the</a>
<a id='line_184'>      procession of the Holy Ghost was forgotten; Bulgaria was forever</a>
<a id='line_185'>      annexed to the Byzantine throne; and the schism was prolonged by</a>
<a id='line_186'>      their rigid censure of all the multiplied ordinations of an</a>
<a id='line_187'>      irregular patriarch. The darkness and corruption of the tenth</a>
<a id='line_188'>      century suspended the intercourse, without reconciling the minds,</a>
<a id='line_189'>      of the two nations. But when the Norman sword restored the</a>
<a id='line_190'>      churches of Apulia to the jurisdiction of Rome, the departing</a>
<a id='line_191'>      flock was warned, by a petulant epistle of the Greek patriarch,</a>
<a id='line_192'>      to avoid and abhor the errors of the Latins. The rising majesty</a>
<a id='line_193'>      of Rome could no longer brook the insolence of a rebel; and</a>
<a id='line_194'>      Michael Cerularius was excommunicated in the heart of</a>
<a id='line_195'>      Constantinople by the pope’s legates. Shaking the dust from their</a>
<a id='line_196'>      feet, they deposited on the altar of St. Sophia a direful</a>
<a id='line_197'>      anathema, 10 which enumerates the seven mortal heresies of the</a>
<a id='line_198'>      Greeks, and devotes the guilty teachers, and their unhappy</a>
<a id='line_199'>      sectaries, to the eternal society of the devil and his angels.</a>
<a id='line_200'>      According to the emergencies of the church and state, a friendly</a>
<a id='line_201'>      correspondence was some times resumed; the language of charity</a>
<a id='line_202'>      and concord was sometimes affected; but the Greeks have never</a>
<a id='line_203'>      recanted their errors; the popes have never repealed their</a>
<a id='line_204'>      sentence; and from this thunderbolt we may date the consummation</a>
<a id='line_205'>      of the schism. It was enlarged by each ambitious step of the</a>
<a id='line_206'>      Roman pontiffs: the emperors blushed and trembled at the</a>
<a id='line_207'>      ignominious fate of their royal brethren of Germany; and the</a>
<a id='line_208'>      people were scandalized by the temporal power and military life</a>

<a id='line_254'>      general conformity of faith and worship, they were abhorred for</a>
<a id='line_255'>      some rules of discipline, some questions of theology, in which</a>
<a id='line_256'>      themselves or their teachers might differ from the Oriental</a>
<a id='line_257'>      church. In the crusade of Louis the Seventh, the Greek clergy</a>
<a id='line_258'>      washed and purified the altars which had been defiled by the</a>
<a id='line_259'>      sacrifice of a French priest. The companions of Frederic</a>
<a id='line_260'>      Barbarossa deplore the injuries which they endured, both in word</a>
<a id='line_261'>      and deed, from the peculiar rancor of the bishops and monks.</a>
<a id='line_262'>      Their prayers and sermons excited the people against the impious</a>
<a id='line_263'>      Barbarians; and the patriarch is accused of declaring, that the</a>
<a id='line_264'>      faithful might obtain the redemption of all their sins by the</a>
<a id='line_265'>      extirpation of the schismatics. 12 An enthusiast, named</a>
<a id='line_266'>      Dorotheus, alarmed the fears, and restored the confidence, of the</a>
<a id='line_267'>      emperor, by a prophetic assurance, that the German heretic, after</a>
<a id='line_268'>      assaulting the gate of Blachernes, would be made a signal example</a>
<a id='line_269'>      of the divine vengeance. The passage of these mighty armies were</a>
<a id='line_270'>      rare and perilous events; but the crusades introduced a frequent</a>
<a id='line_271'>      and familiar intercourse between the two nations, which enlarged</a>
<a id='line_272'>      their knowledge without abating their prejudices. The wealth and</a>
<a id='line_273'>      luxury of Constantinople demanded the productions of every</a>
<a id='line_274'>      climate; these imports were balanced by the art and labor of her</a>
<a id='line_275'>      numerous inhabitants; her situation invites the commerce of the</a>
<a id='line_276'>      world; and, in every period of her existence, that commerce has</a>
<a id='line_277'>      been in the hands of foreigners. After the decline of Amalphi,</a>
<a id='line_278'>      the Venetians, Pisans, and Genoese, introduced their factories</a>
<a id='line_279'>      and settlements into the capital of the empire: their services</a>
<a id='line_280'>      were rewarded with honors and immunities; they acquired the</a>
<a id='line_281'>      possession of lands and houses; their families were multiplied by</a>
<a id='line_282'>      marriages with the natives; and, after the toleration of a</a>
<a id='line_283'>      Mahometan mosque, it was impossible to interdict the churches of</a>
<a id='line_284'>      the Roman rite. 13 The two wives of Manuel Comnenus 14 were of</a>
<a id='line_285'>      the race of the Franks: the first, a sister-in-law of the emperor</a>
<a id='line_286'>      Conrad; the second, a daughter of the prince of Antioch: he</a>
<a id='line_287'>      obtained for his son Alexius a daughter of Philip Augustus, king</a>
<a id='line_288'>      of France; and he bestowed his own daughter on a marquis of</a>
<a id='line_289'>      Montferrat, who was educated and dignified in the palace of</a>
<a id='line_290'>      Constantinople. The Greek encountered the arms, and aspired to</a>
<a id='line_291'>      the empire, of the West: he esteemed the valor, and trusted the</a>
<a id='line_292'>      fidelity, of the Franks; 15 their military talents were unfitly</a>
<a id='line_293'>      recompensed by the lucrative offices of judges and treasures; the</a>
<a id='line_294'>      policy of Manuel had solicited the alliance of the pope; and the</a>
<a id='line_295'>      popular voice accused him of a partial bias to the nation and</a>
<a id='line_296'>      religion of the Latins. 16 During his reign, and that of his</a>
<a id='line_297'>      successor Alexius, they were exposed at Constantinople to the</a>
<a id='line_298'>      reproach of foreigners, heretics, and favorites; and this triple</a>
<a id='line_299'>      guilt was severely expiated in the tumult, which announced the</a>
<a id='line_300'>      return and elevation of Andronicus. 17 The people rose in arms:</a>
<a id='line_301'>      from the Asiatic shore the tyrant despatched his troops and</a>
<a id='line_302'>      galleys to assist the national revenge; and the hopeless</a>
<a id='line_303'>      resistance of the strangers served only to justify the rage, and</a>
<a id='line_304'>      sharpen the daggers, of the assassins. Neither age, nor sex, nor</a>
<a id='line_305'>      the ties of friendship or kindred, could save the victims of</a>
<a id='line_306'>      national hatred, and avarice, and religious zeal; the Latins were</a>
<a id='line_307'>      slaughtered in their houses and in the streets; their quarter was</a>
<a id='line_308'>      reduced to ashes; the clergy were burnt in their churches, and</a>
<a id='line_309'>      the sick in their hospitals; and some estimate may be formed of</a>
<a id='line_310'>      the slain from the clemency which sold above four thousand</a>
<a id='line_311'>      Christians in perpetual slavery to the Turks. The priests and</a>
<a id='line_312'>      monks were the loudest and most active in the destruction of the</a>
<a id='line_313'>      schismatics; and they chanted a thanksgiving to the Lord, when</a>
<a id='line_314'>      the head of a Roman cardinal, the pope’s legate, was severed from</a>
<a id='line_315'>      his body, fastened to the tail of a dog, and dragged, with savage</a>
<a id='line_316'>      mockery, through the city. The more diligent of the strangers had</a>
<a id='line_317'>      retreated, on the first alarm, to their vessels, and escaped</a>
<a id='line_318'>      through the Hellespont from the scene of blood. In their flight,</a>
<a id='line_319'>      they burnt and ravaged two hundred miles of the sea-coast;</a>
<a id='line_320'>      inflicted a severe revenge on the guiltless subjects of the</a>
<a id='line_321'>      empire; marked the priests and monks as their peculiar enemies;</a>
<a id='line_322'>      and compensated, by the accumulation of plunder, the loss of</a>
<a id='line_323'>      their property and friends. On their return, they exposed to</a>
<a id='line_324'>      Italy and Europe the wealth and weakness, the perfidy and malice,</a>
<a id='line_325'>      of the Greeks, whose vices were painted as the genuine characters</a>

<a id='line_393'>      accidental benefits of the times. Isaac slept on the throne, and</a>
<a id='line_394'>      was awakened only by the sound of pleasure: his vacant hours were</a>
<a id='line_395'>      amused by comedians and buffoons, and even to these buffoons the</a>
<a id='line_396'>      emperor was an object of contempt: his feasts and buildings</a>
<a id='line_397'>      exceeded the examples of royal luxury: the number of his eunuchs</a>
<a id='line_398'>      and domestics amounted to twenty thousand; and a daily sum of</a>
<a id='line_399'>      four thousand pounds of silver would swell to four millions</a>
<a id='line_400'>      sterling the annual expense of his household and table. His</a>
<a id='line_401'>      poverty was relieved by oppression; and the public discontent was</a>
<a id='line_402'>      inflamed by equal abuses in the collection, and the application,</a>
<a id='line_403'>      of the revenue. While the Greeks numbered the days of their</a>
<a id='line_404'>      servitude, a flattering prophet, whom he rewarded with the</a>
<a id='line_405'>      dignity of patriarch, assured him of a long and victorious reign</a>
<a id='line_406'>      of thirty-two years; during which he should extend his sway to</a>

<a id='line_504'>      24 was supported by the masculine vices of his wife Euphrosyne.</a>
<a id='line_505'>      The first intelligence of his fall was conveyed to the late</a>
<a id='line_506'>      emperor by the hostile aspect and pursuit of the guards, no</a>

<a id='line_508'>      Stagyra, in Macedonia; but the fugitive, without an object or a</a>
<a id='line_509'>      follower, was arrested, brought back to Constantinople, deprived</a>
<a id='line_510'>      of his eyes, and confined in a lonesome tower, on a scanty</a>
<a id='line_511'>      allowance of bread and water. At the moment of the revolution,</a>
<a id='line_512'>      his son Alexius, whom he educated in the hope of empire, was</a>
<a id='line_513'>      twelve years of age. He was spared by the usurper, and reduced to</a>
<a id='line_514'>      attend his triumph both in peace and war; but as the army was</a>
<a id='line_515'>      encamped on the sea-shore, an Italian vessel facilitated the</a>
<a id='line_516'>      escape of the royal youth; and, in the disguise of a common</a>
<a id='line_517'>      sailor, he eluded the search of his enemies, passed the</a>

<a id='line_566'>      Guelphs and Ghibelines. Philip Augustus of France had performed,</a>

<a id='line_582'>      his elder brother, who had ended his days in Palestine with the</a>

<a id='line_596'>      33 an original narrative of the councils and actions in which he</a>
<a id='line_597'>      bore a memorable part. At the same time, Baldwin, count of</a>

<a id='line_599'>      cross at Bruges, with his brother Henry, and the principal</a>

<a id='line_601'>      The vow which the chiefs had pronounced in churches, they</a>

<a id='line_605'>      death, which was almost ruined by famine and civil war. But the</a>
<a id='line_606'>      fate of so many royal armies displayed the toils and perils of a</a>

<a id='line_678'>      indigent, laborious, and inaccessible, they gradually coalesced</a>
<a id='line_679'>      into a republic: the first foundations of Venice were laid in the</a>
<a id='line_680'>      Island of Rialto; and the annual election of the twelve tribunes</a>
<a id='line_681'>      was superseded by the permanent office of a duke or doge. On the</a>
<a id='line_682'>      verge of the two empires, the Venetians exult in the belief of</a>
<a id='line_683'>      primitive and perpetual independence. 36 Against the Latins,</a>
<a id='line_684'>      their antique freedom has been asserted by the sword, and may be</a>
<a id='line_685'>      justified by the pen. Charlemagne himself resigned all claims of</a>
<a id='line_686'>      sovereignty to the islands of the Adriatic Gulf: his son Pepin</a>
<a id='line_687'>      was repulsed in the attacks of the _lagunas_ or canals, too deep</a>

<a id='line_689'>      age, under the German Cæsars, the lands of the republic have been</a>
<a id='line_690'>      clearly distinguished from the kingdom of Italy. But the</a>
<a id='line_691'>      inhabitants of Venice were considered by themselves, by</a>
<a id='line_692'>      strangers, and by their sovereigns, as an inalienable portion of</a>
<a id='line_693'>      the Greek empire: 37 in the ninth and tenth centuries, the proofs</a>
<a id='line_694'>      of their subjection are numerous and unquestionable; and the vain</a>
<a id='line_695'>      titles, the servile honors, of the Byzantine court, so</a>
<a id='line_696'>      ambitiously solicited by their dukes, would have degraded the</a>
<a id='line_697'>      magistrates of a free people. But the bands of this dependence,</a>
<a id='line_698'>      which was never absolute or rigid, were imperceptibly relaxed by</a>
<a id='line_699'>      the ambition of Venice and the weakness of Constantinople.</a>
<a id='line_700'>      Obedience was softened into respect, privilege ripened into</a>
<a id='line_701'>      prerogative, and the freedom of domestic government was fortified</a>
<a id='line_702'>      by the independence of foreign dominion. The maritime cities of</a>
<a id='line_703'>      Istria and Dalmatia bowed to the sovereigns of the Adriatic; and</a>
<a id='line_704'>      when they armed against the Normans in the cause of Alexius, the</a>
<a id='line_705'>      emperor applied, not to the duty of his subjects, but to the</a>
<a id='line_706'>      gratitude and generosity of his faithful allies. The sea was</a>
<a id='line_707'>      their patrimony: 38 the western parts of the Mediterranean, from</a>
<a id='line_708'>      Tuscany to Gibraltar, were indeed abandoned to their rivals of</a>
<a id='line_709'>      Pisa and Genoa; but the Venetians acquired an early and lucrative</a>
<a id='line_710'>      share of the commerce of Greece and Egypt. Their riches increased</a>
<a id='line_711'>      with the increasing demand of Europe; their manufactures of silk</a>
<a id='line_712'>      and glass, perhaps the institution of their bank, are of high</a>
<a id='line_713'>      antiquity; and they enjoyed the fruits of their industry in the</a>
<a id='line_714'>      magnificence of public and private life. To assert her flag, to</a>
<a id='line_715'>      avenge her injuries, to protect the freedom of navigation, the</a>
<a id='line_716'>      republic could launch and man a fleet of a hundred galleys; and</a>
<a id='line_717'>      the Greeks, the Saracens, and the Normans, were encountered by</a>
<a id='line_718'>      her naval arms. The Franks of Syria were assisted by the</a>
<a id='line_719'>      Venetians in the reduction of the sea coast; but their zeal was</a>
<a id='line_720'>      neither blind nor disinterested; and in the conquest of Tyre,</a>
<a id='line_721'>      they shared the sovereignty of a city, the first seat of the</a>
<a id='line_722'>      commerce of the world. The policy of Venice was marked by the</a>
<a id='line_723'>      avarice of a trading, and the insolence of a maritime, power; yet</a>
<a id='line_724'>      her ambition was prudent: nor did she often forget that if armed</a>
<a id='line_725'>      galleys were the effect and safeguard, merchant vessels were the</a>
<a id='line_726'>      cause and supply, of her greatness. In her religion, she avoided</a>
<a id='line_727'>      the schisms of the Greeks, without yielding a servile obedience</a>
<a id='line_728'>      to the Roman pontiff; and a free intercourse with the infidels of</a>
<a id='line_729'>      every clime appears to have allayed betimes the fever of</a>
<a id='line_730'>      superstition. Her primitive government was a loose mixture of</a>
<a id='line_731'>      democracy and monarchy; the doge was elected by the votes of the</a>

<a id='line_788'>      When the six ambassadors of the French pilgrims arrived at</a>
<a id='line_789'>      Venice, they were hospitably entertained in the palace of St.</a>
<a id='line_790'>      Mark, by the reigning duke; his name was Henry Dandolo; 40 and he</a>
<a id='line_791'>      shone in the last period of human life as one of the most</a>
<a id='line_792'>      illustrious characters of the times. Under the weight of years,</a>
<a id='line_793'>      and after the loss of his eyes, 41 Dandolo retained a sound</a>
<a id='line_794'>      understanding and a manly courage: the spirit of a hero,</a>
<a id='line_795'>      ambitious to signalize his reign by some memorable exploits; and</a>
<a id='line_796'>      the wisdom of a patriot, anxious to build his fame on the glory</a>
<a id='line_797'>      and advantage of his country. He praised the bold enthusiasm and</a>
<a id='line_798'>      liberal confidence of the barons and their deputies: in such a</a>
<a id='line_799'>      cause, and with such associates, he should aspire, were he a</a>
<a id='line_800'>      private man, to terminate his life; but he was the servant of the</a>
<a id='line_801'>      republic, and some delay was requisite to consult, on this</a>
<a id='line_802'>      arduous business, the judgment of his colleagues. The proposal of</a>
<a id='line_803'>      the French was first debated by the six _sages_ who had been</a>
<a id='line_804'>      recently appointed to control the administration of the doge: it</a>
<a id='line_805'>      was next disclosed to the forty members of the council of state;</a>
<a id='line_806'>      and finally communicated to the legislative assembly of four</a>
<a id='line_807'>      hundred and fifty representatives, who were annually chosen in</a>
<a id='line_808'>      the six quarters of the city. In peace and war, the doge was</a>
<a id='line_809'>      still the chief of the republic; his legal authority was</a>
<a id='line_810'>      supported by the personal reputation of Dandolo: his arguments of</a>
<a id='line_811'>      public interest were balanced and approved; and he was authorized</a>
<a id='line_812'>      to inform the ambassadors of the following conditions of the</a>
<a id='line_813'>      treaty. 42 It was proposed that the crusaders should assemble at</a>
<a id='line_814'>      Venice, on the feast of St. John of the ensuing year; that</a>
<a id='line_815'>      flat-bottomed vessels should be prepared for four thousand five</a>
<a id='line_816'>      hundred horses, and nine thousand squires, with a number of ships</a>
<a id='line_817'>      sufficient for the embarkation of four thousand five hundred</a>
<a id='line_818'>      knights, and twenty thousand foot; that during a term of nine</a>
<a id='line_819'>      months they should be supplied with provisions, and transported</a>
<a id='line_820'>      to whatsoever coast the service of God and Christendom should</a>
<a id='line_821'>      require; and that the republic should join the armament with a</a>
<a id='line_822'>      squadron of fifty galleys. It was required, that the pilgrims</a>
<a id='line_823'>      should pay, before their departure, a sum of eighty-five thousand</a>
<a id='line_824'>      marks of silver; and that all conquests, by sea and land, should</a>
<a id='line_825'>      be equally divided between the confederates. The terms were hard;</a>
<a id='line_826'>      but the emergency was pressing, and the French barons were not</a>
<a id='line_827'>      less profuse of money than of blood. A general assembly was</a>
<a id='line_828'>      convened to ratify the treaty: the stately chapel and place of</a>
<a id='line_829'>      St. Mark were filled with ten thousand citizens; and the noble</a>
<a id='line_830'>      deputies were taught a new lesson of humbling themselves before</a>

<a id='line_834'>      the sea for the deliverance of Jerusalem. They have enjoined us</a>
<a id='line_835'>      to fall prostrate at your feet; nor will we rise from the ground</a>

<a id='line_837'>      The eloquence of their words and tears, 43 their martial aspect,</a>

<a id='line_888'>      health of that valiant youth already declined, and soon became</a>

<a id='line_890'>      to expire, not in a field of battle, but on a bed of sickness. To</a>
<a id='line_891'>      his brave and numerous vassals, the dying prince distributed his</a>
<a id='line_892'>      treasures: they swore in his presence to accomplish his vow and</a>
<a id='line_893'>      their own; but some there were, says the marshal, who accepted</a>

<a id='line_895'>      of the cross held a parliament at Soissons for the election of a</a>
<a id='line_896'>      new general; but such was the incapacity, or jealousy, or</a>
<a id='line_897'>      reluctance, of the princes of France, that none could be found</a>
<a id='line_898'>      both able and willing to assume the conduct of the enterprise.</a>
<a id='line_899'>      They acquiesced in the choice of a stranger, of Boniface marquis</a>
<a id='line_900'>      of Montferrat, descended of a race of heroes, and himself of</a>
<a id='line_901'>      conspicuous fame in the wars and negotiations of the times; 44</a>
<a id='line_902'>      nor could the piety or ambition of the Italian chief decline this</a>
<a id='line_903'>      honorable invitation. After visiting the French court, where he</a>
<a id='line_904'>      was received as a friend and kinsman, the marquis, in the church</a>
<a id='line_905'>      of Soissons, was invested with the cross of a pilgrim and the</a>
<a id='line_906'>      staff of a general; and immediately repassed the Alps, to prepare</a>
<a id='line_907'>      for the distant expedition of the East. About the festival of the</a>
<a id='line_908'>      Pentecost he displayed his banner, and marched towards Venice at</a>
<a id='line_909'>      the head of the Italians: he was preceded or followed by the</a>
<a id='line_910'>      counts of Flanders and Blois, and the most respectable barons of</a>
<a id='line_911'>      France; and their numbers were swelled by the pilgrims of</a>
<a id='line_912'>      Germany, 45 whose object and motives were similar to their own.</a>
<a id='line_913'>      The Venetians had fulfilled, and even surpassed, their</a>
<a id='line_914'>      engagements: stables were constructed for the horses, and</a>
<a id='line_915'>      barracks for the troops: the magazines were abundantly</a>
<a id='line_916'>      replenished with forage and provisions; and the fleet of</a>
<a id='line_917'>      transports, ships, and galleys, was ready to hoist sail as soon</a>
<a id='line_918'>      as the republic had received the price of the freight and</a>
<a id='line_919'>      armament. But that price far exceeded the wealth of the crusaders</a>
<a id='line_920'>      who were assembled at Venice. The Flemings, whose obedience to</a>
<a id='line_921'>      their count was voluntary and precarious, had embarked in their</a>
<a id='line_922'>      vessels for the long navigation of the ocean and Mediterranean;</a>
<a id='line_923'>      and many of the French and Italians had preferred a cheaper and</a>
<a id='line_924'>      more convenient passage from Marseilles and Apulia to the Holy</a>
<a id='line_925'>      Land. Each pilgrim might complain, that after he had furnished</a>
<a id='line_926'>      his own contribution, he was made responsible for the deficiency</a>
<a id='line_927'>      of his absent brethren: the gold and silver plate of the chiefs,</a>
<a id='line_928'>      which they freely delivered to the treasury of St. Marks, was a</a>
<a id='line_929'>      generous but inadequate sacrifice; and after all their efforts,</a>
<a id='line_930'>      thirty-four thousand marks were still wanting to complete the</a>
<a id='line_931'>      stipulated sum. The obstacle was removed by the policy and</a>
<a id='line_932'>      patriotism of the doge, who proposed to the barons, that if they</a>
<a id='line_933'>      would join their arms in reducing some revolted cities of</a>
<a id='line_934'>      Dalmatia, he would expose his person in the holy war, and obtain</a>
<a id='line_935'>      from the republic a long indulgence, till some wealthy conquest</a>
<a id='line_936'>      should afford the means of satisfying the debt. After much</a>
<a id='line_937'>      scruple and hesitation, they chose rather to accept the offer</a>
<a id='line_938'>      than to relinquish the enterprise; and the first hostilities of</a>
<a id='line_939'>      the fleet and army were directed against Zara, 46 a strong city</a>
<a id='line_940'>      of the Sclavonian coast, which had renounced its allegiance to</a>
<a id='line_941'>      Venice, and implored the protection of the king of Hungary. 47</a>
<a id='line_942'>      The crusaders burst the chain or boom of the harbor; landed their</a>
<a id='line_943'>      horses, troops, and military engines; and compelled the</a>
<a id='line_944'>      inhabitants, after a defence of five days, to surrender at</a>
<a id='line_945'>      discretion: their lives were spared, but the revolt was punished</a>
<a id='line_946'>      by the pillage of their houses and the demolition of their walls.</a>
<a id='line_947'>      The season was far advanced; the French and Venetians resolved to</a>
<a id='line_948'>      pass the winter in a secure harbor and plentiful country; but</a>
<a id='line_949'>      their repose was disturbed by national and tumultuous quarrels of</a>
<a id='line_950'>      the soldiers and mariners. The conquest of Zara had scattered the</a>
<a id='line_951'>      seeds of discord and scandal: the arms of the allies had been</a>
<a id='line_952'>      stained in their outset with the blood, not of infidels, but of</a>
<a id='line_953'>      Christians: the king of Hungary and his new subjects were</a>
<a id='line_954'>      themselves enlisted under the banner of the cross; and the</a>
<a id='line_955'>      scruples of the devout were magnified by the fear of lassitude of</a>
<a id='line_956'>      the reluctant pilgrims. The pope had excommunicated the false</a>
<a id='line_957'>      crusaders who had pillaged and massacred their brethren, 48 and</a>
<a id='line_958'>      only the marquis Boniface and Simon of Montfort 481 escaped these</a>
<a id='line_959'>      spiritual thunders; the one by his absence from the siege, the</a>

<a id='line_1006'>      restoration and his father’s 50 deliverance. The royal youth was</a>
<a id='line_1007'>      recommended by Philip king of Germany: his prayers and presence</a>
<a id='line_1008'>      excited the compassion of the camp; and his cause was embraced</a>
<a id='line_1009'>      and pleaded by the marquis of Montferrat and the doge of Venice.</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      A double alliance, and the dignity of Cæsar, had connected with</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      the Imperial family the two elder brothers of Boniface: 51 he</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      expected to derive a kingdom from the important service; and the</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      more generous ambition of Dandolo was eager to secure the</a>
<a id='line_1014'>      inestimable benefits of trade and dominion that might accrue to</a>
<a id='line_1015'>      his country. 52 Their influence procured a favorable audience for</a>
<a id='line_1016'>      the ambassadors of Alexius; and if the magnitude of his offers</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      excited some suspicion, the motives and rewards which he</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      displayed might justify the delay and diversion of those forces</a>
<a id='line_1019'>      which had been consecrated to the deliverance of Jerusalem. He</a>
<a id='line_1020'>      promised in his own and his father’s name, that as soon as they</a>
<a id='line_1021'>      should be seated on the throne of Constantinople, they would</a>
<a id='line_1022'>      terminate the long schism of the Greeks, and submit themselves</a>
<a id='line_1023'>      and their people to the lawful supremacy of the Roman church. He</a>
<a id='line_1024'>      engaged to recompense the labors and merits of the crusaders, by</a>
<a id='line_1025'>      the immediate payment of two hundred thousand marks of silver; to</a>
<a id='line_1026'>      accompany them in person to Egypt; or, if it should be judged</a>
<a id='line_1027'>      more advantageous, to maintain, during a year, ten thousand men,</a>
<a id='line_1028'>      and, during his life, five hundred knights, for the service of</a>
<a id='line_1029'>      the Holy Land. These tempting conditions were accepted by the</a>
<a id='line_1030'>      republic of Venice; and the eloquence of the doge and marquis</a>
<a id='line_1031'>      persuaded the counts of Flanders, Blois, and St. Pol, with eight</a>
<a id='line_1032'>      barons of France, to join in the glorious enterprise. A treaty of</a>
<a id='line_1033'>      offensive and defensive alliance was confirmed by their oaths and</a>
<a id='line_1034'>      seals; and each individual, according to his situation and</a>
<a id='line_1035'>      character, was swayed by the hope of public or private advantage;</a>
<a id='line_1036'>      by the honor of restoring an exiled monarch; or by the sincere</a>
<a id='line_1037'>      and probable opinion, that their efforts in Palestine would be</a>
<a id='line_1038'>      fruitless and unavailing, and that the acquisition of</a>
<a id='line_1039'>      Constantinople must precede and prepare the recovery of</a>
<a id='line_1040'>      Jerusalem. But they were the chiefs or equals of a valiant band</a>
<a id='line_1041'>      of freemen and volunteers, who thought and acted for themselves:</a>
<a id='line_1042'>      the soldiers and clergy were divided; and, if a large majority</a>
<a id='line_1043'>      subscribed to the alliance, the numbers and arguments of the</a>
<a id='line_1044'>      dissidents were strong and respectable. 53 The boldest hearts</a>
<a id='line_1045'>      were appalled by the report of the naval power and impregnable</a>
<a id='line_1046'>      strength of Constantinople; and their apprehensions were</a>
<a id='line_1047'>      disguised to the world, and perhaps to themselves, by the more</a>
<a id='line_1048'>      decent objections of religion and duty. They alleged the sanctity</a>
<a id='line_1049'>      of a vow, which had drawn them from their families and homes to</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      the rescue of the holy sepulchre; nor should the dark and crooked</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      counsels of human policy divert them from a pursuit, the event of</a>

<a id='line_1053'>      attack of Zara, had been severely punished by the reproach of</a>
<a id='line_1054'>      their conscience and the censures of the pope; nor would they</a>

<a id='line_1115'>      every eye was fixed with wonder and delight on the scene of</a>

<a id='line_1117'>      of the knights and squires, at once an ornament and a defence,</a>
<a id='line_1118'>      were arranged on either side of the ships; the banners of the</a>

<a id='line_1120'>      artillery was supplied by three hundred engines for casting</a>
<a id='line_1121'>      stones and darts: the fatigues of the way were cheered with the</a>
<a id='line_1122'>      sound of music; and the spirits of the adventurers were raised by</a>
<a id='line_1123'>      the mutual assurance, that forty thousand Christian heroes were</a>
<a id='line_1124'>      equal to the conquest of the world. 55 In the navigation 56 from</a>
<a id='line_1125'>      Venice and Zara, the fleet was successfully steered by the skill</a>
<a id='line_1126'>      and experience of the Venetian pilots: at Durazzo, the</a>
<a id='line_1127'>      confederates first landed on the territories of the Greek empire:</a>
<a id='line_1128'>      the Isle of Corfu afforded a station and repose; they doubled,</a>
<a id='line_1129'>      without accident, the perilous cape of Malea, the southern point</a>
<a id='line_1130'>      of Peloponnesus or the Morea; made a descent in the islands of</a>
<a id='line_1131'>      Negropont and Andros; and cast anchor at Abydus on the Asiatic</a>
<a id='line_1132'>      side of the Hellespont. These preludes of conquest were easy and</a>
<a id='line_1133'>      bloodless: the Greeks of the provinces, without patriotism or</a>
<a id='line_1134'>      courage, were crushed by an irresistible force: the presence of</a>
<a id='line_1135'>      the lawful heir might justify their obedience; and it was</a>
<a id='line_1136'>      rewarded by the modesty and discipline of the Latins. As they</a>
<a id='line_1137'>      penetrated through the Hellespont, the magnitude of their navy</a>
<a id='line_1138'>      was compressed in a narrow channel, and the face of the waters</a>
<a id='line_1139'>      was darkened with innumerable sails. They again expanded in the</a>
<a id='line_1140'>      basin of the Propontis, and traversed that placid sea, till they</a>
<a id='line_1141'>      approached the European shore, at the abbey of St. Stephen, three</a>
<a id='line_1142'>      leagues to the west of Constantinople. The prudent doge dissuaded</a>
<a id='line_1143'>      them from dispersing themselves in a populous and hostile land;</a>
<a id='line_1144'>      and, as their stock of provisions was reduced, it was resolved,</a>
<a id='line_1145'>      in the season of harvest, to replenish their store-ships in the</a>
<a id='line_1146'>      fertile islands of the Propontis. With this resolution, they</a>
<a id='line_1147'>      directed their course: but a strong gale, and their own</a>
<a id='line_1148'>      impatience, drove them to the eastward; and so near did they run</a>
<a id='line_1149'>      to the shore and the city, that some volleys of stones and darts</a>
<a id='line_1150'>      were exchanged between the ships and the rampart. As they passed</a>
<a id='line_1151'>      along, they gazed with admiration on the capital of the East, or,</a>
<a id='line_1152'>      as it should seem, of the earth; rising from her seven hills, and</a>
<a id='line_1153'>      towering over the continents of Europe and Asia. The swelling</a>
<a id='line_1154'>      domes and lofty spires of five hundred palaces and churches were</a>
<a id='line_1155'>      gilded by the sun and reflected in the waters: the walls were</a>
<a id='line_1156'>      crowded with soldiers and spectators, whose numbers they beheld,</a>
<a id='line_1157'>      of whose temper they were ignorant; and each heart was chilled by</a>
<a id='line_1158'>      the reflection, that, since the beginning of the world, such an</a>
<a id='line_1159'>      enterprise had never been undertaken by such a handful of</a>
<a id='line_1160'>      warriors. But the momentary apprehension was dispelled by hope</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      and valor; and every man, says the marshal of Champagne, glanced</a>
<a id='line_1162'>      his eye on the sword or lance which he must speedily use in the</a>
<a id='line_1163'>      glorious conflict. 57 The Latins cast anchor before Chalcedon;</a>
<a id='line_1164'>      the mariners only were left in the vessels: the soldiers, horses,</a>
<a id='line_1165'>      and arms, were safely landed; and, in the luxury of an Imperial</a>
<a id='line_1166'>      palace, the barons tasted the first fruits of their success. On</a>
<a id='line_1167'>      the third day, the fleet and army moved towards Scutari, the</a>
<a id='line_1168'>      Asiatic suburb of Constantinople: a detachment of five hundred</a>

<a id='line_1206'>      Alexius: his flatterers persuaded him, that in this contempt he</a>
<a id='line_1207'>      was bold and sincere; and each evening, in the close of the</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      banquet, he thrice discomfited the Barbarians of the West. These</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      Barbarians had been justly terrified by the report of his naval</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      power; and the sixteen hundred fishing boats of Constantinople 58</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      could have manned a fleet, to sink them in the Adriatic, or stop</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      their entrance in the mouth of the Hellespont. But all force may</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      be annihilated by the negligence of the prince and the venality</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      of his ministers. The great duke, or admiral, made a scandalous,</a>
<a id='line_1215'>      almost a public, auction of the sails, the masts, and the</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      rigging: the royal forests were reserved for the more important</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      purpose of the chase; and the trees, says Nicetas, were guarded</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      by the eunuchs, like the groves of religious worship. 59 From his</a>
<a id='line_1219'>      dream of pride, Alexius was awakened by the siege of Zara, and</a>
<a id='line_1220'>      the rapid advances of the Latins; as soon as he saw the danger</a>
<a id='line_1221'>      was real, he thought it inevitable, and his vain presumption was</a>
<a id='line_1222'>      lost in abject despondency and despair. He suffered these</a>
<a id='line_1223'>      contemptible Barbarians to pitch their camp in the sight of the</a>
<a id='line_1224'>      palace; and his apprehensions were thinly disguised by the pomp</a>

<a id='line_1226'>      was astonished (his ambassadors were instructed to say) at the</a>
<a id='line_1227'>      hostile appearance of the strangers. If these pilgrims were</a>
<a id='line_1228'>      sincere in their vow for the deliverance of Jerusalem, his voice</a>
<a id='line_1229'>      must applaud, and his treasures should assist, their pious design</a>

<a id='line_1232'>      protect them from his just resentment. The answer of the doge and</a>
<a id='line_1233'>      barons was simple and magnanimous. “In the cause of honor and</a>

<a id='line_1256'>      prepared themselves, as soldiers and as Catholics, for the</a>

<a id='line_1262'>      memorable day, which happened to be bright and pleasant, the</a>
<a id='line_1263'>      Latins were distributed in six battles or divisions; the first,</a>
<a id='line_1264'>      or vanguard, was led by the count of Flanders, one of the most</a>
<a id='line_1265'>      powerful of the Christian princes in the skill and number of his</a>
<a id='line_1266'>      crossbows. The four successive battles of the French were</a>
<a id='line_1267'>      commanded by his brother Henry, the counts of St. Pol and Blois,</a>
<a id='line_1268'>      and Matthew of Montmorency; the last of whom was honored by the</a>

<a id='line_1270'>      sixth division, the rear-guard and reserve of the army, was</a>
<a id='line_1271'>      conducted by the marquis of Montferrat, at the head of the</a>
<a id='line_1272'>      Germans and Lombards. The chargers, saddled, with their long</a>
<a id='line_1273'>      caparisons dragging on the ground, were embarked in the flat</a>
<a id='line_1274'>      _palanders_; 60 and the knights stood by the side of their</a>
<a id='line_1275'>      horses, in complete armor, their helmets laced, and their lances</a>
<a id='line_1276'>      in their hands. The numerous train of sergeants 61 and archers</a>
<a id='line_1277'>      occupied the transports; and each transport was towed by the</a>
<a id='line_1278'>      strength and swiftness of a galley. The six divisions traversed</a>
<a id='line_1279'>      the Bosphorus, without encountering an enemy or an obstacle: to</a>
<a id='line_1280'>      land the foremost was the wish, to conquer or die was the</a>
<a id='line_1281'>      resolution, of every division and of every soldier. Jealous of</a>
<a id='line_1282'>      the preeminence of danger, the knights in their heavy armor</a>
<a id='line_1283'>      leaped into the sea, when it rose as high as their girdle; the</a>
<a id='line_1284'>      sergeants and archers were animated by their valor; and the</a>
<a id='line_1285'>      squires, letting down the draw-bridges of the palanders, led the</a>
<a id='line_1286'>      horses to the shore. Before their squadrons could mount, and</a>
<a id='line_1287'>      form, and couch their Lances, the seventy thousand Greeks had</a>
<a id='line_1288'>      vanished from their sight: the timid Alexius gave the example to</a>
<a id='line_1289'>      his troops; and it was only by the plunder of his rich pavilions</a>
<a id='line_1290'>      that the Latins were informed that they had fought against an</a>

<a id='line_1292'>      resolved, by a double attack, to open the entrance of the harbor.</a>
<a id='line_1293'>      The tower of Galata, 62 in the suburb of Pera, was attacked and</a>
<a id='line_1294'>      stormed by the French, while the Venetians assumed the more</a>

<a id='line_1296'>      from that tower to the Byzantine shore. After some fruitless</a>
<a id='line_1297'>      attempts, their intrepid perseverance prevailed: twenty ships of</a>
<a id='line_1298'>      war, the relics of the Grecian navy, were either sunk or taken:</a>
<a id='line_1299'>      the enormous and massy links of iron were cut asunder by the</a>
<a id='line_1300'>      shears, or broken by the weight, of the galleys; 63 and the</a>
<a id='line_1301'>      Venetian fleet, safe and triumphant, rode at anchor in the port</a>
<a id='line_1302'>      of Constantinople. By these daring achievements, a remnant of</a>

<a id='line_1362'>      the entrance to the extremity of the harbor: the stone bridge of</a>
<a id='line_1363'>      the river was hastily repaired; and the six battles of the French</a>
<a id='line_1364'>      formed their encampment against the front of the capital, the</a>
<a id='line_1365'>      basis of the triangle which runs about four miles from the port</a>
<a id='line_1366'>      to the Propontis. 65 On the edge of a broad ditch, at the foot of</a>
<a id='line_1367'>      a lofty rampart, they had leisure to contemplate the difficulties</a>
<a id='line_1368'>      of their enterprise. The gates to the right and left of their</a>
<a id='line_1369'>      narrow camp poured forth frequent sallies of cavalry and</a>
<a id='line_1370'>      light-infantry, which cut off their stragglers, swept the country</a>
<a id='line_1371'>      of provisions, sounded the alarm five or six times in the course</a>
<a id='line_1372'>      of each day, and compelled them to plant a palisade, and sink an</a>
<a id='line_1373'>      intrenchment, for their immediate safety. In the supplies and</a>
<a id='line_1374'>      convoys the Venetians had been too sparing, or the Franks too</a>
<a id='line_1375'>      voracious: the usual complaints of hunger and scarcity were</a>
<a id='line_1376'>      heard, and perhaps felt their stock of flour would be exhausted</a>
<a id='line_1377'>      in three weeks; and their disgust of salt meat tempted them to</a>
<a id='line_1378'>      taste the flesh of their horses. The trembling usurper was</a>
<a id='line_1379'>      supported by Theodore Lascaris, his son-in-law, a valiant youth,</a>
<a id='line_1380'>      who aspired to save and to rule his country; the Greeks,</a>
<a id='line_1381'>      regardless of that country, were awakened to the defence of their</a>
<a id='line_1382'>      religion; but their firmest hope was in the strength and spirit</a>
<a id='line_1383'>      of the Varangian guards, of the Danes and English, as they are</a>
<a id='line_1384'>      named in the writers of the times. 66 After ten days’ incessant</a>
<a id='line_1385'>      labor, the ground was levelled, the ditch filled, the approaches</a>
<a id='line_1386'>      of the besiegers were regularly made, and two hundred and fifty</a>
<a id='line_1387'>      engines of assault exercised their various powers to clear the</a>
<a id='line_1388'>      rampart, to batter the walls, and to sap the foundations. On the</a>
<a id='line_1389'>      first appearance of a breach, the scaling-ladders were applied:</a>
<a id='line_1390'>      the numbers that defended the vantage ground repulsed and</a>
<a id='line_1391'>      oppressed the adventurous Latins; but they admired the resolution</a>
<a id='line_1392'>      of fifteen knights and sergeants, who had gained the ascent, and</a>
<a id='line_1393'>      maintained their perilous station till they were precipitated or</a>
<a id='line_1394'>      made prisoners by the Imperial guards. On the side of the harbor</a>
<a id='line_1395'>      the naval attack was more successfully conducted by the</a>
<a id='line_1396'>      Venetians; and that industrious people employed every resource</a>
<a id='line_1397'>      that was known and practiced before the invention of gunpowder. A</a>
<a id='line_1398'>      double line, three bow-shots in front, was formed by the galleys</a>
<a id='line_1399'>      and ships; and the swift motion of the former was supported by</a>
<a id='line_1400'>      the weight and loftiness of the latter, whose decks, and poops,</a>
<a id='line_1401'>      and turret, were the platforms of military engines, that</a>
<a id='line_1402'>      discharged their shot over the heads of the first line. The</a>
<a id='line_1403'>      soldiers, who leaped from the galleys on shore, immediately</a>
<a id='line_1404'>      planted and ascended their scaling-ladders, while the large</a>
<a id='line_1405'>      ships, advancing more slowly into the intervals, and lowering a</a>
<a id='line_1406'>      draw-bridge, opened a way through the air from their masts to the</a>
<a id='line_1407'>      rampart. In the midst of the conflict, the doge, a venerable and</a>
<a id='line_1408'>      conspicuous form, stood aloft in complete armor on the prow of</a>
<a id='line_1409'>      his galley. The great standard of St. Mark was displayed before</a>
<a id='line_1410'>      him; his threats, promises, and exhortations, urged the diligence</a>
<a id='line_1411'>      of the rowers; his vessel was the first that struck; and Dandolo</a>
<a id='line_1412'>      was the first warrior on the shore. The nations admired the</a>
<a id='line_1413'>      magnanimity of the blind old man, without reflecting that his age</a>
<a id='line_1414'>      and infirmities diminished the price of life, and enhanced the</a>
<a id='line_1415'>      value of immortal glory. On a sudden, by an invisible hand, (for</a>
<a id='line_1416'>      the standard-bearer was probably slain,) the banner of the</a>
<a id='line_1417'>      republic was fixed on the rampart: twenty-five towers were</a>
<a id='line_1418'>      rapidly occupied; and, by the cruel expedient of fire, the Greeks</a>
<a id='line_1419'>      were driven from the adjacent quarter. The doge had despatched</a>
<a id='line_1420'>      the intelligence of his success, when he was checked by the</a>
<a id='line_1421'>      danger of his confederates. Nobly declaring that he would rather</a>
<a id='line_1422'>      die with the pilgrims than gain a victory by their destruction,</a>
<a id='line_1423'>      Dandolo relinquished his advantage, recalled his troops, and</a>
<a id='line_1424'>      hastened to the scene of action. He found the six weary</a>
<a id='line_1425'>      diminutive _battles_ of the French encompassed by sixty squadrons</a>
<a id='line_1426'>      of the Greek cavalry, the least of which was more numerous than</a>
<a id='line_1427'>      the largest of their divisions. Shame and despair had provoked</a>
<a id='line_1428'>      Alexius to the last effort of a general sally; but he was awed by</a>
<a id='line_1429'>      the firm order and manly aspect of the Latins; and, after</a>
<a id='line_1430'>      skirmishing at a distance, withdrew his troops in the close of</a>
<a id='line_1431'>      the evening. The silence or tumult of the night exasperated his</a>
<a id='line_1432'>      fears; and the timid usurper, collecting a treasure of ten</a>
<a id='line_1433'>      thousand pounds of gold, basely deserted his wife, his people,</a>
<a id='line_1434'>      and his fortune; threw himself into a bark; stole through the</a>
<a id='line_1435'>      Bosphorus; and landed in shameful safety in an obscure harbor of</a>
<a id='line_1436'>      Thrace. As soon as they were apprised of his flight, the Greek</a>
<a id='line_1437'>      nobles sought pardon and peace in the dungeon where the blind</a>
<a id='line_1438'>      Isaac expected each hour the visit of the executioner. Again</a>

<a id='line_1440'>      his Imperial robes was replaced on the throne, and surrounded</a>
<a id='line_1441'>      with prostrate slaves, whose real terror and affected joy he was</a>
<a id='line_1442'>      incapable of discerning. At the dawn of day, hostilities were</a>

<a id='line_1487'>      work of their own hands; and the emperor clearly understood, that</a>
<a id='line_1488'>      his son’s engagements with Venice and the pilgrims must be</a>
<a id='line_1489'>      ratified without hesitation or delay. Withdrawing into a private</a>
<a id='line_1490'>      chamber with the empress, a chamberlain, an interpreter, and the</a>
<a id='line_1491'>      four ambassadors, the father of young Alexius inquired with some</a>
<a id='line_1492'>      anxiety into the nature of his stipulations. The submission of</a>
<a id='line_1493'>      the Eastern empire to the pope, the succor of the Holy Land, and</a>
<a id='line_1494'>      a present contribution of two hundred thousand marks of</a>
<a id='line_1495'>      silver.—“These conditions are weighty,” was his prudent reply:</a>
<a id='line_1496'>      “they are hard to accept, and difficult to perform. But no</a>
<a id='line_1497'>      conditions can exceed the measure of your services and deserts.”</a>
<a id='line_1498'>      After this satisfactory assurance, the barons mounted on</a>
<a id='line_1499'>      horseback, and introduced the heir of Constantinople to the city</a>
<a id='line_1500'>      and palace: his youth and marvellous adventures engaged every</a>
<a id='line_1501'>      heart in his favor, and Alexius was solemnly crowned with his</a>
<a id='line_1502'>      father in the dome of St. Sophia. In the first days of his reign,</a>
<a id='line_1503'>      the people, already blessed with the restoration of plenty and</a>
<a id='line_1504'>      peace, was delighted by the joyful catastrophe of the tragedy;</a>
<a id='line_1505'>      and the discontent of the nobles, their regret, and their fears,</a>
<a id='line_1506'>      were covered by the polished surface of pleasure and loyalty The</a>
<a id='line_1507'>      mixture of two discordant nations in the same capital might have</a>
<a id='line_1508'>      been pregnant with mischief and danger; and the suburb of Galata,</a>
<a id='line_1509'>      or Pera, was assigned for the quarters of the French and</a>
<a id='line_1510'>      Venetians. But the liberty of trade and familiar intercourse was</a>
<a id='line_1511'>      allowed between the friendly nations: and each day the pilgrims</a>
<a id='line_1512'>      were tempted by devotion or curiosity to visit the churches and</a>
<a id='line_1513'>      palaces of Constantinople. Their rude minds, insensible perhaps</a>
<a id='line_1514'>      of the finer arts, were astonished by the magnificent scenery:</a>
<a id='line_1515'>      and the poverty of their native towns enhanced the populousness</a>
<a id='line_1516'>      and riches of the first metropolis of Christendom. 68 Descending</a>
<a id='line_1517'>      from his state, young Alexius was prompted by interest and</a>
<a id='line_1518'>      gratitude to repeat his frequent and familiar visits to his Latin</a>
<a id='line_1519'>      allies; and in the freedom of the table, the gay petulance of the</a>
<a id='line_1520'>      French sometimes forgot the emperor of the East. 69 In their most</a>
<a id='line_1521'>      serious conferences, it was agreed, that the reunion of the two</a>
<a id='line_1522'>      churches must be the result of patience and time; but avarice was</a>
<a id='line_1523'>      less tractable than zeal; and a larger sum was instantly</a>
<a id='line_1524'>      disbursed to appease the wants, and silence the importunity, of</a>
<a id='line_1525'>      the crusaders. 70 Alexius was alarmed by the approaching hour of</a>
<a id='line_1526'>      their departure: their absence might have relieved him from the</a>
<a id='line_1527'>      engagement which he was yet incapable of performing; but his</a>
<a id='line_1528'>      friends would have left him, naked and alone, to the caprice and</a>
<a id='line_1529'>      prejudice of a perfidious nation. He wished to bribe their stay,</a>
<a id='line_1530'>      the delay of a year, by undertaking to defray their expense, and</a>
<a id='line_1531'>      to satisfy, in their name, the freight of the Venetian vessels.</a>
<a id='line_1532'>      The offer was agitated in the council of the barons; and, after a</a>
<a id='line_1533'>      repetition of their debates and scruples, a majority of votes</a>
<a id='line_1534'>      again acquiesced in the advice of the doge and the prayer of the</a>
<a id='line_1535'>      young emperor. At the price of sixteen hundred pounds of gold, he</a>
<a id='line_1536'>      prevailed on the marquis of Montferrat to lead him with an army</a>
<a id='line_1537'>      round the provinces of Europe; to establish his authority, and</a>
<a id='line_1538'>      pursue his uncle, while Constantinople was awed by the presence</a>
<a id='line_1539'>      of Baldwin and his confederates of France and Flanders. The</a>
<a id='line_1540'>      expedition was successful: the blind emperor exulted in the</a>
<a id='line_1541'>      success of his arms, and listened to the predictions of his</a>
<a id='line_1542'>      flatterers, that the same Providence which had raised him from</a>
<a id='line_1543'>      the dungeon to the throne, would heal his gout, restore his</a>
<a id='line_1544'>      sight, and watch over the long prosperity of his reign. Yet the</a>

<a id='line_1586'>      devoutly attached to their faith and superstition; and every</a>
<a id='line_1587'>      convent, and every shop, resounded with the danger of the church</a>
<a id='line_1588'>      and the tyranny of the pope. 72 An empty treasury could ill</a>

<a id='line_1595'>      absence of Marquis Boniface and his Imperial pupil,</a>
<a id='line_1596'>      Constantinople was visited with a calamity which might be justly</a>
<a id='line_1597'>      imputed to the zeal and indiscretion of the Flemish pilgrims. 73</a>
<a id='line_1598'>      In one of their visits to the city, they were scandalized by the</a>
<a id='line_1599'>      aspect of a mosque or synagogue, in which one God was worshipped,</a>

<a id='line_1602'>      with fire: but the infidels, and some Christian neighbors,</a>
<a id='line_1603'>      presumed to defend their lives and properties; and the flames</a>
<a id='line_1604'>      which bigotry had kindled, consumed the most orthodox and</a>
<a id='line_1605'>      innocent structures. During eight days and nights, the</a>
<a id='line_1606'>      conflagration spread above a league in front, from the harbor to</a>
<a id='line_1607'>      the Propontis, over the thickest and most populous regions of the</a>

<a id='line_1612'>      which the doge and the barons in vain affected to disclaim, the</a>

<a id='line_1618'>      been insufficient to steer him through the tempest, which</a>
<a id='line_1619'>      overwhelmed the person and government of that unhappy youth. His</a>
<a id='line_1620'>      own inclination, and his father’s advice, attached him to his</a>
<a id='line_1621'>      benefactors; but Alexius hesitated between gratitude and</a>
<a id='line_1622'>      patriotism, between the fear of his subjects and of his allies.</a>
<a id='line_1623'>      74 By his feeble and fluctuating conduct he lost the esteem and</a>
<a id='line_1624'>      confidence of both; and, while he invited the marquis of</a>

<a id='line_1628'>      repeated their demands, resented his delays, suspected his</a>
<a id='line_1629'>      intentions, and exacted a decisive answer of peace or war. The</a>

<a id='line_1730'>      the harbor; but the skill and courage of the Venetians repulsed</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      the fire-ships; and the vagrant flames wasted themselves without</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      injury in the sea. 78 In a nocturnal sally the Greek emperor was</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      vanquished by Henry, brother of the count of Flanders: the</a>
<a id='line_1734'>      advantages of number and surprise aggravated the shame of his</a>
<a id='line_1735'>      defeat: his buckler was found on the field of battle; and the</a>
<a id='line_1736'>      Imperial standard, 79 a divine image of the Virgin, was</a>
<a id='line_1737'>      presented, as a trophy and a relic to the Cistercian monks, the</a>
<a id='line_1738'>      disciples of St. Bernard. Near three months, without excepting</a>
<a id='line_1739'>      the holy season of Lent, were consumed in skirmishes and</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      preparations, before the Latins were ready or resolved for a</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      general assault. The land fortifications had been found</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      impregnable; and the Venetian pilots represented, that, on the</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      shore of the Propontis, the anchorage was unsafe, and the ships</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      must be driven by the current far away to the straits of the</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      Hellespont; a prospect not unpleasing to the reluctant pilgrims,</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      who sought every opportunity of breaking the army. From the</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      harbor, therefore, the assault was determined by the assailants,</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      and expected by the besieged; and the emperor had placed his</a>
<a id='line_1749'>      scarlet pavilions on a neighboring height, to direct and animate</a>
<a id='line_1750'>      the efforts of his troops. A fearless spectator, whose mind could</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      entertain the ideas of pomp and pleasure, might have admired the</a>
<a id='line_1752'>      long array of two embattled armies, which extended above half a</a>
<a id='line_1753'>      league, the one on the ships and galleys, the other on the walls</a>
<a id='line_1754'>      and towers raised above the ordinary level by several stages of</a>
<a id='line_1755'>      wooden turrets. Their first fury was spent in the discharge of</a>
<a id='line_1756'>      darts, stones, and fire, from the engines; but the water was</a>
<a id='line_1757'>      deep; the French were bold; the Venetians were skilful; they</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      approached the walls; and a desperate conflict of swords, spears,</a>
<a id='line_1759'>      and battle-axes, was fought on the trembling bridges that</a>
<a id='line_1760'>      grappled the floating, to the stable, batteries. In more than a</a>
<a id='line_1761'>      hundred places, the assault was urged, and the defence was</a>
<a id='line_1762'>      sustained; till the superiority of ground and numbers finally</a>
<a id='line_1763'>      prevailed, and the Latin trumpets sounded a retreat. On the</a>
<a id='line_1764'>      ensuing days, the attack was renewed with equal vigor, and a</a>
<a id='line_1765'>      similar event; and, in the night, the doge and the barons held a</a>
<a id='line_1766'>      council, apprehensive only for the public danger: not a voice</a>
<a id='line_1767'>      pronounced the words of escape or treaty; and each warrior,</a>
<a id='line_1768'>      according to his temper, embraced the hope of victory, or the</a>
<a id='line_1769'>      assurance of a glorious death. 80 By the experience of the former</a>
<a id='line_1770'>      siege, the Greeks were instructed, but the Latins were animated;</a>
<a id='line_1771'>      and the knowledge that Constantinople might be taken, was of more</a>
<a id='line_1772'>      avail than the local precautions which that knowledge had</a>
<a id='line_1773'>      inspired for its defence. In the third assault, two ships were</a>
<a id='line_1774'>      linked together to double their strength; a strong north wind</a>
<a id='line_1775'>      drove them on the shore; the bishops of Troyes and Soissons led</a>
<a id='line_1776'>      the van; and the auspicious names of the _pilgrim_ and the</a>
<a id='line_1777'>      _paradise_ resounded along the line. 81 The episcopal banners</a>
<a id='line_1778'>      were displayed on the walls; a hundred marks of silver had been</a>
<a id='line_1779'>      promised to the first adventurers; and if their reward was</a>
<a id='line_1780'>      intercepted by death, their names have been immortalized by fame.</a>
<a id='line_1781'>      811 Four towers were scaled; three gates were burst open; and the</a>
<a id='line_1782'>      French knights, who might tremble on the waves, felt themselves</a>
<a id='line_1783'>      invincible on horseback on the solid ground. Shall I relate that</a>
<a id='line_1784'>      the thousands who guarded the emperor’s person fled on the</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      approach, and before the lance, of a single warrior? Their</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      ignominious flight is attested by their countryman Nicetas: an</a>
<a id='line_1787'>      army of phantoms marched with the French hero, and he was</a>
<a id='line_1788'>      magnified to a giant in the eyes of the Greeks. 82 While the</a>
<a id='line_1789'>      fugitives deserted their posts and cast away their arms, the</a>
<a id='line_1790'>      Latins entered the city under the banners of their leaders: the</a>
<a id='line_1791'>      streets and gates opened for their passage; and either design or</a>
<a id='line_1792'>      accident kindled a third conflagration, which consumed in a few</a>
<a id='line_1793'>      hours the measure of three of the largest cities of France. 83 In</a>
<a id='line_1794'>      the close of evening, the barons checked their troops, and</a>
<a id='line_1795'>      fortified their stations: They were awed by the extent and</a>
<a id='line_1796'>      populousness of the capital, which might yet require the labor of</a>
<a id='line_1797'>      a month, if the churches and palaces were conscious of their</a>
<a id='line_1798'>      internal strength. But in the morning, a suppliant procession,</a>
<a id='line_1799'>      with crosses and images, announced the submission of the Greeks,</a>
<a id='line_1800'>      and deprecated the wrath of the conquerors: the usurper escaped</a>
<a id='line_1801'>      through the golden gate: the palaces of Blachernæ and Boucoleon</a>
<a id='line_1802'>      were occupied by the count of Flanders and the marquis of</a>
<a id='line_1803'>      Montferrat; and the empire, which still bore the name of</a>

<a id='line_1868'>      massacred, not by the strangers, but by the Latins, who had been</a>
<a id='line_1869'>      driven from the city, and who exercised the revenge of a</a>
<a id='line_1870'>      triumphant faction. Yet of these exiles, some were less mindful</a>
<a id='line_1871'>      of injuries than of benefits; and Nicetas himself was indebted</a>

<a id='line_1876'>      incest, were perpetrated in open day; and that noble matrons and</a>
<a id='line_1877'>      holy nuns were polluted by the grooms and peasants of the</a>
<a id='line_1878'>      Catholic camp. 86 It is indeed probable that the license of</a>
<a id='line_1879'>      victory prompted and covered a multitude of sins: but it is</a>
<a id='line_1880'>      certain, that the capital of the East contained a stock of venal</a>
<a id='line_1881'>      or willing beauty, sufficient to satiate the desires of twenty</a>
<a id='line_1882'>      thousand pilgrims; and female prisoners were no longer subject to</a>
<a id='line_1883'>      the right or abuse of domestic slavery. The marquis of Montferrat</a>
<a id='line_1884'>      was the patron of discipline and decency; the count of Flanders</a>
<a id='line_1885'>      was the mirror of chastity: they had forbidden, under pain of</a>
<a id='line_1886'>      death, the rape of married women, or virgins, or nuns; and the</a>
<a id='line_1887'>      proclamation was sometimes invoked by the vanquished 87 and</a>
<a id='line_1888'>      respected by the victors. Their cruelty and lust were moderated</a>
<a id='line_1889'>      by the authority of the chiefs, and feelings of the soldiers; for</a>
<a id='line_1890'>      we are no longer describing an irruption of the northern savages;</a>
<a id='line_1891'>      and however ferocious they might still appear, time, policy, and</a>
<a id='line_1892'>      religion had civilized the manners of the French, and still more</a>
<a id='line_1893'>      of the Italians. But a free scope was allowed to their avarice,</a>
<a id='line_1894'>      which was glutted, even in the holy week, by the pillage of</a>
<a id='line_1895'>      Constantinople. The right of victory, unshackled by any promise</a>
<a id='line_1896'>      or treaty, had confiscated the public and private wealth of the</a>
<a id='line_1897'>      Greeks; and every hand, according to its size and strength, might</a>
<a id='line_1898'>      lawfully execute the sentence and seize the forfeiture. A</a>
<a id='line_1899'>      portable and universal standard of exchange was found in the</a>
<a id='line_1900'>      coined and uncoined metals of gold and silver, which each captor,</a>
<a id='line_1901'>      at home or abroad, might convert into the possessions most</a>
<a id='line_1902'>      suitable to his temper and situation. Of the treasures, which</a>
<a id='line_1903'>      trade and luxury had accumulated, the silks, velvets, furs, the</a>
<a id='line_1904'>      gems, spices, and rich movables, were the most precious, as they</a>
<a id='line_1905'>      could not be procured for money in the ruder countries of Europe.</a>
<a id='line_1906'>      An order of rapine was instituted; nor was the share of each</a>
<a id='line_1907'>      individual abandoned to industry or chance. Under the tremendous</a>
<a id='line_1908'>      penalties of perjury, excommunication, and death, the Latins were</a>
<a id='line_1909'>      bound to deliver their plunder into the common stock: three</a>
<a id='line_1910'>      churches were selected for the deposit and distribution of the</a>
<a id='line_1911'>      spoil: a single share was allotted to a foot-soldier; two for a</a>
<a id='line_1912'>      sergeant on horseback; four to a knight; and larger proportions</a>
<a id='line_1913'>      according to the rank and merit of the barons and princes. For</a>
<a id='line_1914'>      violating this sacred engagement, a knight belonging to the count</a>
<a id='line_1915'>      of St. Paul was hanged with his shield and coat of arms round his</a>
<a id='line_1916'>      neck; his example might render similar offenders more artful and</a>
<a id='line_1917'>      discreet; but avarice was more powerful than fear; and it is</a>
<a id='line_1918'>      generally believed that the secret far exceeded the acknowledged</a>
<a id='line_1919'>      plunder. Yet the magnitude of the prize surpassed the largest</a>
<a id='line_1920'>      scale of experience or expectation. 88 After the whole had been</a>
<a id='line_1921'>      equally divided between the French and Venetians, fifty thousand</a>
<a id='line_1922'>      marks were deducted to satisfy the debts of the former and the</a>
<a id='line_1923'>      demands of the latter. The residue of the French amounted to four</a>

<a id='line_1983'>      had nothing to lose, might derive some profit from the</a>
<a id='line_1984'>      revolution; but the misery of the upper ranks of society is</a>
<a id='line_1985'>      strongly painted in the personal adventures of Nicetas himself.</a>
<a id='line_1986'>      His stately palace had been reduced to ashes in the second</a>
<a id='line_1987'>      conflagration; and the senator, with his family and friends,</a>
<a id='line_1988'>      found an obscure shelter in another house which he possessed near</a>
<a id='line_1989'>      the church of St. Sophia. It was the door of this mean habitation</a>
<a id='line_1990'>      that his friend, the Venetian merchant, guarded in the disguise</a>
<a id='line_1991'>      of a soldier, till Nicetas could save, by a precipitate flight,</a>
<a id='line_1992'>      the relics of his fortune and the chastity of his daughter. In a</a>
<a id='line_1993'>      cold, wintry season, these fugitives, nursed in the lap of</a>
<a id='line_1994'>      prosperity, departed on foot; his wife was with child; the</a>
<a id='line_1995'>      desertion of their slaves compelled them to carry their baggage</a>
<a id='line_1996'>      on their own shoulders; and their women, whom they placed in the</a>
<a id='line_1997'>      centre, were exhorted to conceal their beauty with dirt, instead</a>
<a id='line_1998'>      of adorning it with paint and jewels Every step was exposed to</a>
<a id='line_1999'>      insult and danger: the threats of the strangers were less painful</a>
<a id='line_2000'>      than the taunts of the plebeians, with whom they were now</a>
<a id='line_2001'>      levelled; nor did the exiles breathe in safety till their</a>
<a id='line_2002'>      mournful pilgrimage was concluded at Selymbria, above forty miles</a>
<a id='line_2003'>      from the capital. On the way they overtook the patriarch, without</a>
<a id='line_2004'>      attendance and almost without apparel, riding on an ass, and</a>
<a id='line_2005'>      reduced to a state of apostolical poverty, which, had it been</a>
<a id='line_2006'>      voluntary, might perhaps have been meritorious. In the mean</a>
<a id='line_2007'>      while, his desolate churches were profaned by the licentiousness</a>
<a id='line_2008'>      and party zeal of the Latins. After stripping the gems and</a>
<a id='line_2009'>      pearls, they converted the chalices into drinking-cups; their</a>
<a id='line_2010'>      tables, on which they gamed and feasted, were covered with the</a>
<a id='line_2011'>      pictures of Christ and the saints; and they trampled under foot</a>
<a id='line_2012'>      the most venerable objects of the Christian worship. In the</a>
<a id='line_2013'>      cathedral of St. Sophia, the ample veil of the sanctuary was rent</a>
<a id='line_2014'>      asunder for the sake of the golden fringe; and the altar, a</a>
<a id='line_2015'>      monument of art and riches, was broken in pieces and shared among</a>
<a id='line_2016'>      the captors. Their mules and horses were laden with the wrought</a>
<a id='line_2017'>      silver and gilt carvings, which they tore down from the doors and</a>
<a id='line_2018'>      pulpit; and if the beasts stumbled under the burden, they were</a>
<a id='line_2019'>      stabbed by their impatient drivers, and the holy pavement</a>
<a id='line_2020'>      streamed with their impure blood. A prostitute was seated on the</a>
<a id='line_2021'>      throne of the patriarch; and that daughter of Belial, as she is</a>
<a id='line_2022'>      styled, sung and danced in the church, to ridicule the hymns and</a>
<a id='line_2023'>      processions of the Orientals. Nor were the repositories of the</a>
<a id='line_2024'>      royal dead secure from violation: in the church of the Apostles,</a>
<a id='line_2025'>      the tombs of the emperors were rifled; and it is said, that after</a>
<a id='line_2026'>      six centuries the corpse of Justinian was found without any signs</a>
<a id='line_2027'>      of decay or putrefaction. In the streets, the French and Flemings</a>
<a id='line_2028'>      clothed themselves and their horses in painted robes and flowing</a>
<a id='line_2029'>      head-dresses of linen; and the coarse intemperance of their</a>
<a id='line_2030'>      feasts 92 insulted the splendid sobriety of the East. To expose</a>
<a id='line_2031'>      the arms of a people of scribes and scholars, they affected to</a>
<a id='line_2032'>      display a pen, an inkhorn, and a sheet of paper, without</a>

<a id='line_2057'>      paganism, some gods and heroes were saved from the axe of</a>
<a id='line_2058'>      superstition; and the forum and hippodrome were dignified with</a>
<a id='line_2059'>      the relics of a better age. Several of these are described by</a>
<a id='line_2060'>      Nicetas, 95 in a florid and affected style; and from his</a>
<a id='line_2061'>      descriptions I shall select some interesting particulars. _1._</a>
<a id='line_2062'>      The victorious charioteers were cast in bronze, at their own or</a>
<a id='line_2063'>      the public charge, and fitly placed in the hippodrome: they stood</a>
<a id='line_2064'>      aloft in their chariots, wheeling round the goal: the spectators</a>
<a id='line_2065'>      could admire their attitude, and judge of the resemblance; and of</a>
<a id='line_2066'>      these figures, the most perfect might have been transported from</a>
<a id='line_2067'>      the Olympic stadium. _2._ The sphinx, river-horse, and crocodile,</a>
<a id='line_2068'>      denote the climate and manufacture of Egypt and the spoils of</a>
<a id='line_2069'>      that ancient province. _3._ The she-wolf suckling Romulus and</a>
<a id='line_2070'>      Remus, a subject alike pleasing to the _old_ and the _new_</a>
<a id='line_2071'>      Romans, but which could really be treated before the decline of</a>
<a id='line_2072'>      the Greek sculpture. _4._ An eagle holding and tearing a serpent</a>
<a id='line_2073'>      in his talons, a domestic monument of the Byzantines, which they</a>
<a id='line_2074'>      ascribed, not to a human artist, but to the magic power of the</a>
<a id='line_2075'>      philosopher Apollonius, who, by this talisman, delivered the city</a>
<a id='line_2076'>      from such venomous reptiles. _5._ An ass and his driver, which</a>
<a id='line_2077'>      were erected by Augustus in his colony of Nicopolis, to</a>
<a id='line_2078'>      commemorate a verbal omen of the victory of Actium. _6._ An</a>
<a id='line_2079'>      equestrian statue which passed, in the vulgar opinion, for</a>
<a id='line_2080'>      Joshua, the Jewish conqueror, stretching out his hand to stop the</a>
<a id='line_2081'>      course of the descending sun. A more classical tradition</a>
<a id='line_2082'>      recognized the figures of Bellerophon and Pegasus; and the free</a>
<a id='line_2083'>      attitude of the steed seemed to mark that he trod on air, rather</a>
<a id='line_2084'>      than on the earth. _7._ A square and lofty obelisk of brass; the</a>
<a id='line_2085'>      sides were embossed with a variety of picturesque and rural</a>
<a id='line_2086'>      scenes, birds singing; rustics laboring, or playing on their</a>
<a id='line_2087'>      pipes; sheep bleating; lambs skipping; the sea, and a scene of</a>
<a id='line_2088'>      fish and fishing; little naked cupids laughing, playing, and</a>
<a id='line_2089'>      pelting each other with apples; and, on the summit, a female</a>
<a id='line_2090'>      figure, turning with the slightest breath, and thence denominated</a>
<a id='line_2091'>      _the wind’s attendant_. _8._ The Phrygian shepherd presenting to</a>
<a id='line_2092'>      Venus the prize of beauty, the apple of discord. _9._ The</a>
<a id='line_2093'>      incomparable statue of Helen, which is delineated by Nicetas in</a>
<a id='line_2094'>      the words of admiration and love: her well-turned feet, snowy</a>
<a id='line_2095'>      arms, rosy lips, bewitching smiles, swimming eyes, arched</a>
<a id='line_2096'>      eyebrows, the harmony of her shape, the lightness of her drapery,</a>
<a id='line_2097'>      and her flowing locks that waved in the wind; a beauty that might</a>
<a id='line_2098'>      have moved her Barbarian destroyers to pity and remorse. _10._</a>
<a id='line_2099'>      The manly or divine form of Hercules, 96 as he was restored to</a>
<a id='line_2100'>      life by the masterhand of Lysippus; of such magnitude, that his</a>
<a id='line_2101'>      thumb was equal to his waist, his leg to the stature, of a common</a>
<a id='line_2102'>      man: 97 his chest ample, his shoulders broad, his limbs strong</a>
<a id='line_2103'>      and muscular, his hair curled, his aspect commanding. Without his</a>
<a id='line_2104'>      bow, or quiver, or club, his lion’s skin carelessly thrown over</a>
<a id='line_2105'>      him, he was seated on an osier basket, his right leg and arm</a>
<a id='line_2106'>      stretched to the utmost, his left knee bent, and supporting his</a>
<a id='line_2107'>      elbow, his head reclining on his left hand, his countenance</a>
<a id='line_2108'>      indignant and pensive. _11._ A colossal statue of Juno, which had</a>
<a id='line_2109'>      once adorned her temple of Samos, the enormous head by four yoke</a>
<a id='line_2110'>      of oxen was laboriously drawn to the palace. _12._ Another</a>
<a id='line_2111'>      colossus, of Pallas or Minerva, thirty feet in height, and</a>
<a id='line_2112'>      representing with admirable spirit the attributes and character</a>
<a id='line_2113'>      of the martial maid. Before we accuse the Latins, it is just to</a>
<a id='line_2114'>      remark, that this Pallas was destroyed after the first siege, by</a>
<a id='line_2115'>      the fear and superstition of the Greeks themselves. 98 The other</a>
<a id='line_2116'>      statues of brass which I have enumerated were broken and melted</a>
<a id='line_2117'>      by the unfeeling avarice of the crusaders: the cost and labor</a>
<a id='line_2118'>      were consumed in a moment; the soul of genius evaporated in</a>
<a id='line_2119'>      smoke; and the remnant of base metal was coined into money for</a>
<a id='line_2120'>      the payment of the troops. Bronze is not the most durable of</a>
<a id='line_2121'>      monuments: from the marble forms of Phidias and Praxiteles, the</a>
<a id='line_2122'>      Latins might turn aside with stupid contempt; 99 but unless they</a>
<a id='line_2123'>      were crushed by some accidental injury, those useless stones</a>
<a id='line_2124'>      stood secure on their pedestals. 100 The most enlightened of the</a>
<a id='line_2125'>      strangers, above the gross and sensual pursuits of their</a>
<a id='line_2126'>      countrymen, more piously exercised the right of conquest in the</a>
<a id='line_2127'>      search and seizure of the relics of the saints. 101 Immense was</a>
<a id='line_2128'>      the supply of heads and bones, crosses and images, that were</a>
<a id='line_2129'>      scattered by this revolution over the churches of Europe; and</a>
<a id='line_2130'>      such was the increase of pilgrimage and oblation, that no branch,</a>
<a id='line_2131'>      perhaps, of more lucrative plunder was imported from the East.</a>
