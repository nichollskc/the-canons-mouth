<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'>     Final Destruction Of Paganism.—Introduction Of The Worship Of</a>
<a id='line_3'>     Saints, And Relics, Among The Christians.</a>
<a id='line_4'></a>
<a id='line_5'>      The ruin of Paganism, in the age of Theodosius, is perhaps the</a>
<a id='line_6'>      only example of the total extirpation of any ancient and popular</a>
<a id='line_7'>      superstition; and may therefore deserve to be considered as a</a>
<a id='line_8'>      singular event in the history of the human mind. The Christians,</a>
<a id='line_9'>      more especially the clergy, had impatiently supported the prudent</a>
<a id='line_10'>      delays of Constantine, and the equal toleration of the elder</a>
<a id='line_11'>      Valentinian; nor could they deem their conquest perfect or</a>
<a id='line_12'>      secure, as long as their adversaries were permitted to exist. The</a>
<a id='line_13'>      influence which Ambrose and his brethren had acquired over the</a>
<a id='line_14'>      youth of Gratian, and the piety of Theodosius, was employed to</a>
<a id='line_15'>      infuse the maxims of persecution into the breasts of their</a>
<a id='line_16'>      Imperial proselytes. Two specious principles of religious</a>
<a id='line_17'>      jurisprudence were established, from whence they deduced a direct</a>
<a id='line_18'>      and rigorous conclusion, against the subjects of the empire who</a>
<a id='line_19'>      still adhered to the ceremonies of their ancestors: that the</a>
<a id='line_20'>      magistrate is, in some measure, guilty of the crimes which he</a>
<a id='line_21'>      neglects to prohibit, or to punish; and, that the idolatrous</a>
<a id='line_22'>      worship of fabulous deities, and real daemons, is the most</a>
<a id='line_23'>      abominable crime against the supreme majesty of the Creator. The</a>
<a id='line_24'>      laws of Moses, and the examples of Jewish history, 1 were</a>
<a id='line_25'>      hastily, perhaps erroneously, applied, by the clergy, to the mild</a>
<a id='line_26'>      and universal reign of Christianity. 2 The zeal of the emperors</a>
<a id='line_27'>      was excited to vindicate their own honor, and that of the Deity:</a>
<a id='line_28'>      and the temples of the Roman world were subverted, about sixty</a>
<a id='line_29'>      years after the conversion of Constantine.</a>

<a id='line_41'>      the temporal reign of Jehovah over the Jews. The attempt is</a>
<a id='line_42'>      laudable.]</a>
<a id='line_43'></a>
<a id='line_44'>      From the age of Numa to the reign of Gratian, the Romans</a>
<a id='line_45'>      preserved the regular succession of the several colleges of the</a>
<a id='line_46'>      sacerdotal order. 3 Fifteen Pontiffs exercised their supreme</a>
<a id='line_47'>      jurisdiction over all things, and persons, that were consecrated</a>
<a id='line_48'>      to the service of the gods; and the various questions which</a>
<a id='line_49'>      perpetually arose in a loose and traditionary system, were</a>
<a id='line_50'>      submitted to the judgment of their holy tribunal. Fifteen grave</a>
<a id='line_51'>      and learned Augurs observed the face of the heavens, and</a>
<a id='line_52'>      prescribed the actions of heroes, according to the flight of</a>
<a id='line_53'>      birds. Fifteen keepers of the Sibylline books (their name of</a>
<a id='line_54'>      Quindecemvirs was derived from their number) occasionally</a>
<a id='line_55'>      consulted the history of future, and, as it should seem, of</a>
<a id='line_56'>      contingent, events. Six Vestals devoted their virginity to the</a>
<a id='line_57'>      guard of the sacred fire, and of the unknown pledges of the</a>
<a id='line_58'>      duration of Rome; which no mortal had been suffered to behold</a>
<a id='line_59'>      with impunity. 4 Seven Epulos prepared the table of the gods,</a>
<a id='line_60'>      conducted the solemn procession, and regulated the ceremonies of</a>
<a id='line_61'>      the annual festival. The three Flamens of Jupiter, of Mars, and</a>
<a id='line_62'>      of Quirinus, were considered as the peculiar ministers of the</a>
<a id='line_63'>      three most powerful deities, who watched over the fate of Rome</a>
<a id='line_64'>      and of the universe. The King of the Sacrifices represented the</a>
<a id='line_65'>      person of Numa, and of his successors, in the religious</a>
<a id='line_66'>      functions, which could be performed only by royal hands. The</a>
<a id='line_67'>      confraternities of the Salians, the Lupercals, &c., practised</a>
<a id='line_68'>      such rites as might extort a smile of contempt from every</a>
<a id='line_69'>      reasonable man, with a lively confidence of recommending</a>
<a id='line_70'>      themselves to the favor of the immortal gods. The authority,</a>
<a id='line_71'>      which the Roman priests had formerly obtained in the counsels of</a>
<a id='line_72'>      the republic, was gradually abolished by the establishment of</a>
<a id='line_73'>      monarchy, and the removal of the seat of empire. But the dignity</a>
<a id='line_74'>      of their sacred character was still protected by the laws, and</a>
<a id='line_75'>      manners of their country; and they still continued, more</a>
<a id='line_76'>      especially the college of pontiffs, to exercise in the capital,</a>
<a id='line_77'>      and sometimes in the provinces, the rights of their</a>
<a id='line_78'>      ecclesiastical and civil jurisdiction. Their robes of purple,</a>
<a id='line_79'>      chariotz of state, and sumptuous entertainments, attracted the</a>
<a id='line_80'>      admiration of the people; and they received, from the consecrated</a>
<a id='line_81'>      lands, and the public revenue, an ample stipend, which liberally</a>
<a id='line_82'>      supported the splendor of the priesthood, and all the expenses of</a>
<a id='line_83'>      the religious worship of the state. As the service of the altar</a>
<a id='line_84'>      was not incompatible with the command of armies, the Romans,</a>
<a id='line_85'>      after their consulships and triumphs, aspired to the place of</a>
<a id='line_86'>      pontiff, or of augur; the seats of Cicero 5 and Pompey were</a>
<a id='line_87'>      filled, in the fourth century, by the most illustrious members of</a>
<a id='line_88'>      the senate; and the dignity of their birth reflected additional</a>
<a id='line_89'>      splendor on their sacerdotal character. The fifteen priests, who</a>
<a id='line_90'>      composed the college of pontiffs, enjoyed a more distinguished</a>
<a id='line_91'>      rank as the companions of their sovereign; and the Christian</a>
<a id='line_92'>      emperors condescended to accept the robe and ensigns, which were</a>
<a id='line_93'>      appropriated to the office of supreme pontiff. But when Gratian</a>
<a id='line_94'>      ascended the throne, more scrupulous or more enlightened, he</a>
<a id='line_95'>      sternly rejected those profane symbols; 6 applied to the service</a>
<a id='line_96'>      of the state, or of the church, the revenues of the priests and</a>
<a id='line_97'>      vestals; abolished their honors and immunities; and dissolved the</a>
<a id='line_98'>      ancient fabric of Roman superstition, which was supported by the</a>
<a id='line_99'>      opinions and habits of eleven hundred years. Paganism was still</a>
<a id='line_100'>      the constitutional religion of the senate. The hall, or temple,</a>
<a id='line_101'>      in which they assembled, was adorned by the statue and altar of</a>
<a id='line_102'>      Victory; 7 a majestic female standing on a globe, with flowing</a>
<a id='line_103'>      garments, expanded wings, and a crown of laurel in her</a>
<a id='line_104'>      outstretched hand. 8 The senators were sworn on the altar of the</a>
<a id='line_105'>      goddess to observe the laws of the emperor and of the empire: and</a>
<a id='line_106'>      a solemn offering of wine and incense was the ordinary prelude of</a>
<a id='line_107'>      their public deliberations. 9 The removal of this ancient</a>
<a id='line_108'>      monument was the only injury which Constantius had offered to the</a>
<a id='line_109'>      superstition of the Romans. The altar of Victory was again</a>
<a id='line_110'>      restored by Julian, tolerated by Valentinian, and once more</a>
<a id='line_111'>      banished from the senate by the zeal of Gratian. 10 But the</a>
<a id='line_112'>      emperor yet spared the statues of the gods which were exposed to</a>
<a id='line_113'>      the public veneration: four hundred and twenty-four temples, or</a>
<a id='line_114'>      chapels, still remained to satisfy the devotion of the people;</a>
<a id='line_115'>      and in every quarter of Rome the delicacy of the Christians was</a>
<a id='line_116'>      offended by the fumes of idolatrous sacrifice. 11</a>

<a id='line_161'>      deplores the public scandals of Rome, which continually offended</a>
<a id='line_162'>      the eyes, the ears, and the nostrils of the faithful.]</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>      But the Christians formed the least numerous party in the senate</a>
<a id='line_165'>      of Rome: 12 and it was only by their absence, that they could</a>
<a id='line_166'>      express their dissent from the legal, though profane, acts of a</a>
<a id='line_167'>      Pagan majority. In that assembly, the dying embers of freedom</a>
<a id='line_168'>      were, for a moment, revived and inflamed by the breath of</a>
<a id='line_169'>      fanaticism. Four respectable deputations were successively voted</a>
<a id='line_170'>      to the Imperial court, 13 to represent the grievances of the</a>
<a id='line_171'>      priesthood and the senate, and to solicit the restoration of the</a>
<a id='line_172'>      altar of Victory. The conduct of this important business was</a>
<a id='line_173'>      intrusted to the eloquent Symmachus, 14 a wealthy and noble</a>
<a id='line_174'>      senator, who united the sacred characters of pontiff and augur</a>
<a id='line_175'>      with the civil dignities of proconsul of Africa and præfect of</a>
<a id='line_176'>      the city. The breast of Symmachus was animated by the warmest</a>
<a id='line_177'>      zeal for the cause of expiring Paganism; and his religious</a>
<a id='line_178'>      antagonists lamented the abuse of his genius, and the inefficacy</a>
<a id='line_179'>      of his moral virtues. 15 The orator, whose petition is extant to</a>
<a id='line_180'>      the emperor Valentinian, was conscious of the difficulty and</a>
<a id='line_181'>      danger of the office which he had assumed. He cautiously avoids</a>
<a id='line_182'>      every topic which might appear to reflect on the religion of his</a>
<a id='line_183'>      sovereign; humbly declares, that prayers and entreaties are his</a>
<a id='line_184'>      only arms; and artfully draws his arguments from the schools of</a>
<a id='line_185'>      rhetoric, rather than from those of philosophy. Symmachus</a>
<a id='line_186'>      endeavors to seduce the imagination of a young prince, by</a>
<a id='line_187'>      displaying the attributes of the goddess of victory; he</a>
<a id='line_188'>      insinuates, that the confiscation of the revenues, which were</a>
<a id='line_189'>      consecrated to the service of the gods, was a measure unworthy of</a>
<a id='line_190'>      his liberal and disinterested character; and he maintains, that</a>
<a id='line_191'>      the Roman sacrifices would be deprived of their force and energy,</a>
<a id='line_192'>      if they were no longer celebrated at the expense, as well as in</a>
<a id='line_193'>      the name, of the republic. Even scepticism is made to supply an</a>
<a id='line_194'>      apology for superstition. The great and incomprehensible secret</a>
<a id='line_195'>      of the universe eludes the inquiry of man. Where reason cannot</a>
<a id='line_196'>      instruct, custom may be permitted to guide; and every nation</a>
<a id='line_197'>      seems to consult the dictates of prudence, by a faithful</a>
<a id='line_198'>      attachment to those rites and opinions, which have received the</a>
<a id='line_199'>      sanction of ages. If those ages have been crowned with glory and</a>
<a id='line_200'>      prosperity, if the devout people have frequently obtained the</a>
<a id='line_201'>      blessings which they have solicited at the altars of the gods, it</a>
<a id='line_202'>      must appear still more advisable to persist in the same salutary</a>
<a id='line_203'>      practice; and not to risk the unknown perils that may attend any</a>
<a id='line_204'>      rash innovations. The test of antiquity and success was applied</a>
<a id='line_205'>      with singular advantage to the religion of Numa; and Rome</a>
<a id='line_206'>      herself, the celestial genius that presided over the fates of the</a>
<a id='line_207'>      city, is introduced by the orator to plead her own cause before</a>
<a id='line_208'>      the tribunal of the emperors. “Most excellent princes,” says the</a>
<a id='line_209'>      venerable matron, “fathers of your country! pity and respect my</a>
<a id='line_210'>      age, which has hitherto flowed in an uninterrupted course of</a>
<a id='line_211'>      piety. Since I do not repent, permit me to continue in the</a>
<a id='line_212'>      practice of my ancient rites. Since I am born free, allow me to</a>
<a id='line_213'>      enjoy my domestic institutions. This religion has reduced the</a>
<a id='line_214'>      world under my laws. These rites have repelled Hannibal from the</a>
<a id='line_215'>      city, and the Gauls from the Capitol. Were my gray hairs reserved</a>
<a id='line_216'>      for such intolerable disgrace? I am ignorant of the new system</a>
<a id='line_217'>      that I am required to adopt; but I am well assured, that the</a>
<a id='line_218'>      correction of old age is always an ungrateful and ignominious</a>
<a id='line_219'>      office.” 16 The fears of the people supplied what the discretion</a>
<a id='line_220'>      of the orator had suppressed; and the calamities, which</a>
<a id='line_221'>      afflicted, or threatened, the declining empire, were unanimously</a>
<a id='line_222'>      imputed, by the Pagans, to the new religion of Christ and of</a>

<a id='line_254'>      flowers. Few facts, and few sentiments, can be extracted from his</a>
<a id='line_255'>      verbose correspondence.]</a>
<a id='line_256'></a>
<a id='line_257'>      But the hopes of Symmachus were repeatedly baffled by the firm</a>
<a id='line_258'>      and dexterous opposition of the archbishop of Milan, who</a>
<a id='line_259'>      fortified the emperors against the fallacious eloquence of the</a>
<a id='line_260'>      advocate of Rome. In this controversy, Ambrose condescends to</a>
<a id='line_261'>      speak the language of a philosopher, and to ask, with some</a>
<a id='line_262'>      contempt, why it should be thought necessary to introduce an</a>
<a id='line_263'>      imaginary and invisible power, as the cause of those victories,</a>
<a id='line_264'>      which were sufficiently explained by the valor and discipline of</a>
<a id='line_265'>      the legions. He justly derides the absurd reverence for</a>
<a id='line_266'>      antiquity, which could only tend to discourage the improvements</a>
<a id='line_267'>      of art, and to replunge the human race into their original</a>
<a id='line_268'>      barbarism. From thence, gradually rising to a more lofty and</a>
<a id='line_269'>      theological tone, he pronounces, that Christianity alone is the</a>
<a id='line_270'>      doctrine of truth and salvation; and that every mode of</a>
<a id='line_271'>      Polytheism conducts its deluded votaries, through the paths of</a>
<a id='line_272'>      error, to the abyss of eternal perdition. 17 Arguments like</a>
<a id='line_273'>      these, when they were suggested by a favorite bishop, had power</a>
<a id='line_274'>      to prevent the restoration of the altar of Victory; but the same</a>
<a id='line_275'>      arguments fell, with much more energy and effect, from the mouth</a>
<a id='line_276'>      of a conqueror; and the gods of antiquity were dragged in triumph</a>
<a id='line_277'>      at the chariot-wheels of Theodosius. 18 In a full meeting of the</a>
<a id='line_278'>      senate, the emperor proposed, according to the forms of the</a>
<a id='line_279'>      republic, the important question, Whether the worship of Jupiter,</a>
<a id='line_280'>      or that of Christ, should be the religion of the Romans. 1811 The</a>
<a id='line_281'>      liberty of suffrages, which he affected to allow, was destroyed</a>
<a id='line_282'>      by the hopes and fears that his presence inspired; and the</a>
<a id='line_283'>      arbitrary exile of Symmachus was a recent admonition, that it</a>
<a id='line_284'>      might be dangerous to oppose the wishes of the monarch. On a</a>
<a id='line_285'>      regular division of the senate, Jupiter was condemned and</a>
<a id='line_286'>      degraded by the sense of a very large majority; and it is rather</a>
<a id='line_287'>      surprising, that any members should be found bold enough to</a>
<a id='line_288'>      declare, by their speeches and votes, that they were still</a>
<a id='line_289'>      attached to the interest of an abdicated deity. 19 The hasty</a>
<a id='line_290'>      conversion of the senate must be attributed either to</a>
<a id='line_291'>      supernatural or to sordid motives; and many of these reluctant</a>
<a id='line_292'>      proselytes betrayed, on every favorable occasion, their secret</a>
<a id='line_293'>      disposition to throw aside the mask of odious dissimulation. But</a>
<a id='line_294'>      they were gradually fixed in the new religion, as the cause of</a>
<a id='line_295'>      the ancient became more hopeless; they yielded to the authority</a>
<a id='line_296'>      of the emperor, to the fashion of the times, and to the</a>
<a id='line_297'>      entreaties of their wives and children, 20 who were instigated</a>
<a id='line_298'>      and governed by the clergy of Rome and the monks of the East. The</a>
<a id='line_299'>      edifying example of the Anician family was soon imitated by the</a>
<a id='line_300'>      rest of the nobility: the Bassi, the Paullini, the Gracchi,</a>
<a id='line_301'>      embraced the Christian religion; and “the luminaries of the</a>
<a id='line_302'>      world, the venerable assembly of Catos (such are the high-flown</a>
<a id='line_303'>      expressions of Prudentius) were impatient to strip themselves of</a>
<a id='line_304'>      their pontifical garment; to cast the skin of the old serpent; to</a>
<a id='line_305'>      assume the snowy robes of baptismal innocence, and to humble the</a>

<a id='line_307'>      citizens, who subsisted by their own industry, and the populace,</a>

<a id='line_312'>      Romans; 22 the splendor of the Capitol was defaced, and the</a>
<a id='line_313'>      solitary temples were abandoned to ruin and contempt. 23 Rome</a>

<a id='line_423'>      been suspended near twenty years since the death of Constantius,</a>
<a id='line_424'>      24 was vigorously resumed, and finally accomplished, by the zeal</a>
<a id='line_425'>      of Theodosius. Whilst that warlike prince yet struggled with the</a>
<a id='line_426'>      Goths, not for the glory, but for the safety, of the republic, he</a>
<a id='line_427'>      ventured to offend a considerable party of his subjects, by some</a>
<a id='line_428'>      acts which might perhaps secure the protection of Heaven, but</a>
<a id='line_429'>      which must seem rash and unseasonable in the eye of human</a>
<a id='line_430'>      prudence. The success of his first experiments against the Pagans</a>
<a id='line_431'>      encouraged the pious emperor to reiterate and enforce his edicts</a>
<a id='line_432'>      of proscription: the same laws which had been originally</a>
<a id='line_433'>      published in the provinces of the East, were applied, after the</a>
<a id='line_434'>      defeat of Maximus, to the whole extent of the Western empire; and</a>
<a id='line_435'>      every victory of the orthodox Theodosius contributed to the</a>
<a id='line_436'>      triumph of the Christian and Catholic faith. 25 He attacked</a>
<a id='line_437'>      superstition in her most vital part, by prohibiting the use of</a>
<a id='line_438'>      sacrifices, which he declared to be criminal as well as infamous;</a>
<a id='line_439'>      and if the terms of his edicts more strictly condemned the</a>
<a id='line_440'>      impious curiosity which examined the entrails of the victim, 26</a>
<a id='line_441'>      every subsequent explanation tended to involve in the same guilt</a>
<a id='line_442'>      the general practice of immolation, which essentially constituted</a>
<a id='line_443'>      the religion of the Pagans. As the temples had been erected for</a>
<a id='line_444'>      the purpose of sacrifice, it was the duty of a benevolent prince</a>
<a id='line_445'>      to remove from his subjects the dangerous temptation of offending</a>
<a id='line_446'>      against the laws which he had enacted. A special commission was</a>
<a id='line_447'>      granted to Cynegius, the Prætorian præfect of the East, and</a>
<a id='line_448'>      afterwards to the counts Jovius and Gaudentius, two officers of</a>
<a id='line_449'>      distinguished rank in the West; by which they were directed to</a>
<a id='line_450'>      shut the temples, to seize or destroy the instruments of</a>
<a id='line_451'>      idolatry, to abolish the privileges of the priests, and to</a>
<a id='line_452'>      confiscate the consecrated property for the benefit of the</a>
<a id='line_453'>      emperor, of the church, or of the army. 27 Here the desolation</a>
<a id='line_454'>      might have stopped: and the naked edifices, which were no longer</a>
<a id='line_455'>      employed in the service of idolatry, might have been protected</a>
<a id='line_456'>      from the destructive rage of fanaticism. Many of those temples</a>
<a id='line_457'>      were the most splendid and beautiful monuments of Grecian</a>
<a id='line_458'>      architecture; and the emperor himself was interested not to</a>
<a id='line_459'>      deface the splendor of his own cities, or to diminish the value</a>
<a id='line_460'>      of his own possessions. Those stately edifices might be suffered</a>
<a id='line_461'>      to remain, as so many lasting trophies of the victory of Christ.</a>
<a id='line_462'>      In the decline of the arts they might be usefully converted into</a>
<a id='line_463'>      magazines, manufactures, or places of public assembly: and</a>
<a id='line_464'>      perhaps, when the walls of the temple had been sufficiently</a>
<a id='line_465'>      purified by holy rites, the worship of the true Deity might be</a>
<a id='line_466'>      allowed to expiate the ancient guilt of idolatry. But as long as</a>
<a id='line_467'>      they subsisted, the Pagans fondly cherished the secret hope, that</a>
<a id='line_468'>      an auspicious revolution, a second Julian, might again restore</a>
<a id='line_469'>      the altars of the gods: and the earnestness with which they</a>
<a id='line_470'>      addressed their unavailing prayers to the throne, 28 increased</a>
<a id='line_471'>      the zeal of the Christian reformers to extirpate, without mercy,</a>
<a id='line_472'>      the root of superstition. The laws of the emperors exhibit some</a>
<a id='line_473'>      symptoms of a milder disposition: 29 but their cold and languid</a>
<a id='line_474'>      efforts were insufficient to stem the torrent of enthusiasm and</a>
<a id='line_475'>      rapine, which was conducted, or rather impelled, by the spiritual</a>
<a id='line_476'>      rulers of the church. In Gaul, the holy Martin, bishop of Tours,</a>
<a id='line_477'>      30 marched at the head of his faithful monks to destroy the</a>
<a id='line_478'>      idols, the temples, and the consecrated trees of his extensive</a>
<a id='line_479'>      diocese; and, in the execution of this arduous task, the prudent</a>
<a id='line_480'>      reader will judge whether Martin was supported by the aid of</a>
<a id='line_481'>      miraculous powers, or of carnal weapons. In Syria, the divine and</a>
<a id='line_482'>      excellent Marcellus, 31 as he is styled by Theodoret, a bishop</a>
<a id='line_483'>      animated with apostolic fervor, resolved to level with the ground</a>
<a id='line_484'>      the stately temples within the diocese of Apamea. His attack was</a>
<a id='line_485'>      resisted by the skill and solidity with which the temple of</a>
<a id='line_486'>      Jupiter had been constructed. The building was seated on an</a>
<a id='line_487'>      eminence: on each of the four sides, the lofty roof was supported</a>
<a id='line_488'>      by fifteen massy columns, sixteen feet in circumference; and the</a>
<a id='line_489'>      large stone, of which they were composed, were firmly cemented</a>
<a id='line_490'>      with lead and iron. The force of the strongest and sharpest tools</a>
<a id='line_491'>      had been tried without effect. It was found necessary to</a>
<a id='line_492'>      undermine the foundations of the columns, which fell down as soon</a>
<a id='line_493'>      as the temporary wooden props had been consumed with fire; and</a>
<a id='line_494'>      the difficulties of the enterprise are described under the</a>
<a id='line_495'>      allegory of a black daemon, who retarded, though he could not</a>
<a id='line_496'>      defeat, the operations of the Christian engineers. Elated with</a>
<a id='line_497'>      victory, Marcellus took the field in person against the powers of</a>
<a id='line_498'>      darkness; a numerous troop of soldiers and gladiators marched</a>
<a id='line_499'>      under the episcopal banner, and he successively attacked the</a>
<a id='line_500'>      villages and country temples of the diocese of Apamea. Whenever</a>
<a id='line_501'>      any resistance or danger was apprehended, the champion of the</a>
<a id='line_502'>      faith, whose lameness would not allow him either to fight or fly,</a>
<a id='line_503'>      placed himself at a convenient distance, beyond the reach of</a>
<a id='line_504'>      darts. But this prudence was the occasion of his death: he was</a>
<a id='line_505'>      surprised and slain by a body of exasperated rustics; and the</a>
<a id='line_506'>      synod of the province pronounced, without hesitation, that the</a>
<a id='line_507'>      holy Marcellus had sacrificed his life in the cause of God. In</a>
<a id='line_508'>      the support of this cause, the monks, who rushed with tumultuous</a>

<a id='line_601'>      superstitious Egypt. 36 The first of the Ptolemies had been</a>

<a id='line_609'>      foreign deity within the walls of their cities. 38 But the</a>
<a id='line_610'>      obsequious priests, who were seduced by the liberality of the</a>
<a id='line_611'>      Ptolemies, submitted, without resistance, to the power of the god</a>

<a id='line_685'>      of Bacchus, 4411 convinced the Pagans that he meditated a more</a>

<a id='line_687'>      Egypt, the slightest provocation was sufficient to inflame a</a>
<a id='line_688'>      civil war. The votaries of Serapis, whose strength and numbers</a>

<a id='line_698'>      answer of Theodosius should determine the fate of Serapis. The</a>
<a id='line_699'>      two parties assembled, without arms, in the principal square; and</a>
<a id='line_700'>      the Imperial rescript was publicly read. But when a sentence of</a>
<a id='line_701'>      destruction against the idols of Alexandria was pronounced, the</a>
<a id='line_702'>      Christians set up a shout of joy and exultation, whilst the</a>
<a id='line_703'>      unfortunate Pagans, whose fury had given way to consternation,</a>
<a id='line_704'>      retired with hasty and silent steps, and eluded, by their flight</a>
<a id='line_705'>      or obscurity, the resentment of their enemies. Theophilus</a>
<a id='line_706'>      proceeded to demolish the temple of Serapis, without any other</a>
<a id='line_707'>      difficulties, than those which he found in the weight and</a>
<a id='line_708'>      solidity of the materials: but these obstacles proved so</a>
<a id='line_709'>      insuperable, that he was obliged to leave the foundations; and to</a>
<a id='line_710'>      content himself with reducing the edifice itself to a heap of</a>
<a id='line_711'>      rubbish, a part of which was soon afterwards cleared away, to</a>
<a id='line_712'>      make room for a church, erected in honor of the Christian</a>
<a id='line_713'>      martyrs. The valuable library of Alexandria was pillaged or</a>
<a id='line_714'>      destroyed; and near twenty years afterwards, the appearance of</a>
<a id='line_715'>      the empty shelves excited the regret and indignation of every</a>
<a id='line_716'>      spectator, whose mind was not totally darkened by religious</a>
<a id='line_717'>      prejudice. 46 The compositions of ancient genius, so many of</a>
<a id='line_718'>      which have irretrievably perished, might surely have been</a>
<a id='line_719'>      excepted from the wreck of idolatry, for the amusement and</a>
<a id='line_720'>      instruction of succeeding ages; and either the zeal or the</a>
<a id='line_721'>      avarice of the archbishop, 47 might have been satiated with the</a>
<a id='line_722'>      rich spoils, which were the reward of his victory. While the</a>
<a id='line_723'>      images and vases of gold and silver were carefully melted, and</a>
<a id='line_724'>      those of a less valuable metal were contemptuously broken, and</a>
<a id='line_725'>      cast into the streets, Theophilus labored to expose the frauds</a>
<a id='line_726'>      and vices of the ministers of the idols; their dexterity in the</a>
<a id='line_727'>      management of the loadstone; their secret methods of introducing</a>
<a id='line_728'>      a human actor into a hollow statue; 4711 and their scandalous</a>
<a id='line_729'>      abuse of the confidence of devout husbands and unsuspecting</a>
<a id='line_730'>      females. 48 Charges like these may seem to deserve some degree of</a>
<a id='line_731'>      credit, as they are not repugnant to the crafty and interested</a>
<a id='line_732'>      spirit of superstition. But the same spirit is equally prone to</a>
<a id='line_733'>      the base practice of insulting and calumniating a fallen enemy;</a>
<a id='line_734'>      and our belief is naturally checked by the reflection, that it is</a>
<a id='line_735'>      much less difficult to invent a fictitious story, than to support</a>
<a id='line_736'>      a practical fraud. The colossal statue of Serapis 49 was involved</a>
<a id='line_737'>      in the ruin of his temple and religion. A great number of plates</a>
<a id='line_738'>      of different metals, artificially joined together, composed the</a>
<a id='line_739'>      majestic figure of the deity, who touched on either side the</a>
<a id='line_740'>      walls of the sanctuary. The aspect of Serapis, his sitting</a>
<a id='line_741'>      posture, and the sceptre, which he bore in his left hand, were</a>
<a id='line_742'>      extremely similar to the ordinary representations of Jupiter. He</a>
<a id='line_743'>      was distinguished from Jupiter by the basket, or bushel, which</a>
<a id='line_744'>      was placed on his head; and by the emblematic monster which he</a>
<a id='line_745'>      held in his right hand; the head and body of a serpent branching</a>
<a id='line_746'>      into three tails, which were again terminated by the triple heads</a>
<a id='line_747'>      of a dog, a lion, and a wolf. It was confidently affirmed, that</a>
<a id='line_748'>      if any impious hand should dare to violate the majesty of the</a>
<a id='line_749'>      god, the heavens and the earth would instantly return to their</a>
<a id='line_750'>      original chaos. An intrepid soldier, animated by zeal, and armed</a>
<a id='line_751'>      with a weighty battle-axe, ascended the ladder; and even the</a>
<a id='line_752'>      Christian multitude expected, with some anxiety, the event of the</a>
<a id='line_753'>      combat. 50 He aimed a vigorous stroke against the cheek of</a>
<a id='line_754'>      Serapis; the cheek fell to the ground; the thunder was still</a>
<a id='line_755'>      silent, and both the heavens and the earth continued to preserve</a>
<a id='line_756'>      their accustomed order and tranquillity. The victorious soldier</a>
<a id='line_757'>      repeated his blows: the huge idol was overthrown, and broken in</a>
<a id='line_758'>      pieces; and the limbs of Serapis were ignominiously dragged</a>

<a id='line_885'>      by the entrails of the victim, are declared (without any regard</a>
<a id='line_886'>      to the object of the inquiry) a crime of high treason against the</a>
<a id='line_887'>      state, which can be expiated only by the death of the guilty. The</a>

<a id='line_974'>      been proscribed, as a revolt from the ancient and hereditary</a>
<a id='line_975'>      religion of the empire; and the unjust suspicions which were</a>

<a id='line_977'>      measure, countenanced by the inseparable union and rapid</a>
<a id='line_978'>      conquests of the Catholic church. But the same excuses of fear</a>
<a id='line_979'>      and ignorance cannot be applied to the Christian emperors who</a>
<a id='line_980'>      violated the precepts of humanity and of the Gospel. The</a>
<a id='line_981'>      experience of ages had betrayed the weakness, as well as folly,</a>
<a id='line_982'>      of Paganism; the light of reason and of faith had already</a>
<a id='line_983'>      exposed, to the greatest part of mankind, the vanity of idols;</a>
<a id='line_984'>      and the declining sect, which still adhered to their worship,</a>
<a id='line_985'>      might have been permitted to enjoy, in peace and obscurity, the</a>
<a id='line_986'>      religious costumes of their ancestors. Had the Pagans been</a>
<a id='line_987'>      animated by the undaunted zeal which possessed the minds of the</a>

<a id='line_993'>      The violent and repeated strokes of the orthodox princes were</a>
<a id='line_994'>      broken by the soft and yielding substance against which they were</a>

<a id='line_1001'>      hopes of concealment, to indulge their favorite superstition,</a>
<a id='line_1002'>      their humble repentance disarmed the severity of the Christian</a>
<a id='line_1003'>      magistrate, and they seldom refused to atone for their rashness,</a>
<a id='line_1004'>      by submitting, with some secret reluctance, to the yoke of the</a>
<a id='line_1005'>      Gospel. The churches were filled with the increasing multitude of</a>
<a id='line_1006'>      these unworthy proselytes, who had conformed, from temporal</a>
<a id='line_1007'>      motives, to the reigning religion; and whilst they devoutly</a>
<a id='line_1008'>      imitated the postures, and recited the prayers, of the faithful,</a>
<a id='line_1009'>      they satisfied their conscience by the silent and sincere</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      invocation of the gods of antiquity. 58 If the Pagans wanted</a>

<a id='line_1210'>      deposited under the altars of Christ, on which the bishops of the</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      royal city continually offered the unbloody sacrifice. 71 The new</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      capital of the Eastern world, unable to produce any ancient and</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      domestic trophies, was enriched by the spoils of dependent</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      provinces. The bodies of St. Andrew, St. Luke, and St. Timothy,</a>
<a id='line_1215'>      had reposed near three hundred years in the obscure graves, from</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      whence they were transported, in solemn pomp, to the church of</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      the apostles, which the magnificence of Constantine had founded</a>

<a id='line_1223'>      Samuel were received by the people with the same joy and</a>

<a id='line_1324'>      and the illustrious Stephen, the first martyr of the Christian</a>

<a id='line_1329'>      of Lucian to inform the bishop of Jerusalem of their situation</a>
<a id='line_1330'>      and their wishes. The doubts and difficulties which still</a>
<a id='line_1331'>      retarded this important discovery were successively removed by</a>
<a id='line_1332'>      new visions; and the ground was opened by the bishop, in the</a>
<a id='line_1333'>      presence of an innumerable multitude. The coffins of Gamaliel, of</a>
<a id='line_1334'>      his son, and of his friend, were found in regular order; but when</a>
<a id='line_1335'>      the fourth coffin, which contained the remains of Stephen, was</a>
<a id='line_1336'>      shown to the light, the earth trembled, and an odor, such as that</a>
<a id='line_1337'>      of paradise, was smelt, which instantly cured the various</a>
<a id='line_1338'>      diseases of seventy-three of the assistants. The companions of</a>
<a id='line_1339'>      Stephen were left in their peaceful residence of Caphargamala:</a>

<a id='line_1342'>      and the minute particles of those relics, a drop of blood, 78 or</a>

<a id='line_1345'>      virtue. The grave and learned Augustin, 79 whose understanding</a>
<a id='line_1346'>      scarcely admits the excuse of credulity, has attested the</a>
<a id='line_1347'>      innumerable prodigies which were performed in Africa by the</a>
<a id='line_1348'>      relics of St. Stephen; and this marvellous narrative is inserted</a>
<a id='line_1349'>      in the elaborate work of the City of God, which the bishop of</a>
<a id='line_1350'>      Hippo designed as a solid and immortal proof of the truth of</a>
<a id='line_1351'>      Christianity. Augustin solemnly declares, that he has selected</a>
<a id='line_1352'>      those miracles only which were publicly certified by the persons</a>
<a id='line_1353'>      who were either the objects, or the spectators, of the power of</a>

<a id='line_1355'>      had been less favorably treated than the other cities of the</a>

<a id='line_1399'>      souls, in the long interval between the dissolution and the</a>
<a id='line_1400'>      resurrection of their bodies, it was evident that the superior</a>
<a id='line_1401'>      spirits of the saints and martyrs did not consume that portion of</a>
<a id='line_1402'>      their existence in silent and inglorious sleep. 81 It was evident</a>
<a id='line_1403'>      (without presuming to determine the place of their habitation, or</a>
<a id='line_1404'>      the nature of their felicity) that they enjoyed the lively and</a>
<a id='line_1405'>      active consciousness of their happiness, their virtue, and their</a>
<a id='line_1406'>      powers; and that they had already secured the possession of their</a>
<a id='line_1407'>      eternal reward. The enlargement of their intellectual faculties</a>
<a id='line_1408'>      surpassed the measure of the human imagination; since it was</a>
<a id='line_1409'>      proved by experience, that they were capable of hearing and</a>
<a id='line_1410'>      understanding the various petitions of their numerous votaries;</a>
<a id='line_1411'>      who, in the same moment of time, but in the most distant parts of</a>
<a id='line_1412'>      the world, invoked the name and assistance of Stephen or of</a>
<a id='line_1413'>      Martin. 82 The confidence of their petitioners was founded on the</a>
<a id='line_1414'>      persuasion, that the saints, who reigned with Christ, cast an eye</a>
<a id='line_1415'>      of pity upon earth; that they were warmly interested in the</a>
<a id='line_1416'>      prosperity of the Catholic Church; and that the individuals, who</a>
<a id='line_1417'>      imitated the example of their faith and piety, were the peculiar</a>
<a id='line_1418'>      and favorite objects of their most tender regard. Sometimes,</a>
<a id='line_1419'>      indeed, their friendship might be influenced by considerations of</a>
<a id='line_1420'>      a less exalted kind: they viewed with partial affection the</a>
<a id='line_1421'>      places which had been consecrated by their birth, their</a>
<a id='line_1422'>      residence, their death, their burial, or the possession of their</a>
<a id='line_1423'>      relics. The meaner passions of pride, avarice, and revenge, may</a>
<a id='line_1424'>      be deemed unworthy of a celestial breast; yet the saints</a>
<a id='line_1425'>      themselves condescended to testify their grateful approbation of</a>
<a id='line_1426'>      the liberality of their votaries; and the sharpest bolts of</a>
<a id='line_1427'>      punishment were hurled against those impious wretches, who</a>
<a id='line_1428'>      violated their magnificent shrines, or disbelieved their</a>
<a id='line_1429'>      supernatural power. 83 Atrocious, indeed, must have been the</a>
<a id='line_1430'>      guilt, and strange would have been the scepticism, of those men,</a>

<a id='line_1434'>      compelled to obey. 84 The immediate, and almost instantaneous,</a>
<a id='line_1435'>      effects that were supposed to follow the prayer, or the offence,</a>

<a id='line_1437'>      authority which the saints enjoyed in the presence of the Supreme</a>

<a id='line_1507'>      tombs of the martyrs, in the hope of obtaining, from their</a>
<a id='line_1508'>      powerful intercession, every sort of spiritual, but more</a>
<a id='line_1509'>      especially of temporal, blessings. They implored the preservation</a>
<a id='line_1510'>      of their health, or the cure of their infirmities; the</a>
<a id='line_1511'>      fruitfulness of their barren wives, or the safety and happiness</a>
<a id='line_1512'>      of their children. Whenever they undertook any distant or</a>
<a id='line_1513'>      dangerous journey, they requested, that the holy martyrs would be</a>
<a id='line_1514'>      their guides and protectors on the road; and if they returned</a>
<a id='line_1515'>      without having experienced any misfortune, they again hastened to</a>
<a id='line_1516'>      the tombs of the martyrs, to celebrate, with grateful</a>
<a id='line_1517'>      thanksgivings, their obligations to the memory and relics of</a>
<a id='line_1518'>      those heavenly patrons. The walls were hung round with symbols of</a>
<a id='line_1519'>      the favors which they had received; eyes, and hands, and feet, of</a>
<a id='line_1520'>      gold and silver: and edifying pictures, which could not long</a>

<a id='line_1527'>      ministers of the Catholic church imitated the profane model,</a>
<a id='line_1528'>      which they were impatient to destroy. The most respectable</a>
