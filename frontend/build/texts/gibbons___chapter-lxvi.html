<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>      In the four last centuries of the Greek emperors, their friendly</a>
<a id='line_10'>      or hostile aspect towards the pope and the Latins may be observed</a>
<a id='line_11'>      as the thermometer of their prosperity or distress; as the scale</a>
<a id='line_12'>      of the rise and fall of the Barbarian dynasties. When the Turks</a>
<a id='line_13'>      of the house of Seljuk pervaded Asia, and threatened</a>
<a id='line_14'>      Constantinople, we have seen, at the council of Placentia, the</a>
<a id='line_15'>      suppliant ambassadors of Alexius imploring the protection of the</a>
<a id='line_16'>      common father of the Christians. No sooner had the arms of the</a>
<a id='line_17'>      French pilgrims removed the sultan from Nice to Iconium, than the</a>
<a id='line_18'>      Greek princes resumed, or avowed, their genuine hatred and</a>
<a id='line_19'>      contempt for the schismatics of the West, which precipitated the</a>
<a id='line_20'>      first downfall of their empire. The date of the Mogul invasion is</a>
<a id='line_21'>      marked in the soft and charitable language of John Vataces. After</a>
<a id='line_22'>      the recovery of Constantinople, the throne of the first</a>
<a id='line_23'>      Palæologus was encompassed by foreign and domestic enemies; as</a>
<a id='line_24'>      long as the sword of Charles was suspended over his head, he</a>
<a id='line_25'>      basely courted the favor of the Roman pontiff; and sacrificed to</a>
<a id='line_26'>      the present danger his faith, his virtue, and the affection of</a>
<a id='line_27'>      his subjects. On the decease of Michael, the prince and people</a>
<a id='line_28'>      asserted the independence of their church, and the purity of</a>
<a id='line_29'>      their creed: the elder Andronicus neither feared nor loved the</a>
<a id='line_30'>      Latins; in his last distress, pride was the safeguard of</a>
<a id='line_31'>      superstition; nor could he decently retract in his age the firm</a>
<a id='line_32'>      and orthodox declarations of his youth. His grandson, the younger</a>
<a id='line_33'>      Andronicus, was less a slave in his temper and situation; and the</a>
<a id='line_34'>      conquest of Bithynia by the Turks admonished him to seek a</a>
<a id='line_35'>      temporal and spiritual alliance with the Western princes. After a</a>
<a id='line_36'>      separation and silence of fifty years, a secret agent, the monk</a>
<a id='line_37'>      Barlaam, was despatched to Pope Benedict the Twelfth; and his</a>
<a id='line_38'>      artful instructions appear to have been drawn by the master-hand</a>
<a id='line_39'>      of the great domestic. 1 “Most holy father,” was he commissioned</a>
<a id='line_40'>      to say, “the emperor is not less desirous than yourself of a</a>
<a id='line_41'>      union between the two churches: but in this delicate transaction,</a>
<a id='line_42'>      he is obliged to respect his own dignity and the prejudices of</a>
<a id='line_43'>      his subjects. The ways of union are twofold; force and</a>
<a id='line_44'>      persuasion. Of force, the inefficacy has been already tried;</a>
<a id='line_45'>      since the Latins have subdued the empire, without subduing the</a>
<a id='line_46'>      minds, of the Greeks. The method of persuasion, though slow, is</a>
<a id='line_47'>      sure and permanent. A deputation of thirty or forty of our</a>
<a id='line_48'>      doctors would probably agree with those of the Vatican, in the</a>
<a id='line_49'>      love of truth and the unity of belief; but on their return, what</a>
<a id='line_50'>      would be the use, the recompense, of such an agreement? the scorn</a>
<a id='line_51'>      of their brethren, and the reproaches of a blind and obstinate</a>
<a id='line_52'>      nation. Yet that nation is accustomed to reverence the general</a>
<a id='line_53'>      councils, which have fixed the articles of our faith; and if they</a>
<a id='line_54'>      reprobate the decrees of Lyons, it is because the Eastern</a>
<a id='line_55'>      churches were neither heard nor represented in that arbitrary</a>
<a id='line_56'>      meeting. For this salutary end, it will be expedient, and even</a>
<a id='line_57'>      necessary, that a well-chosen legate should be sent into Greece,</a>
<a id='line_58'>      to convene the patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch,</a>
<a id='line_59'>      and Jerusalem; and, with their aid, to prepare a free and</a>
<a id='line_60'>      universal synod. But at this moment,” continued the subtle agent,</a>
<a id='line_61'>      “the empire is assaulted and endangered by the Turks, who have</a>
<a id='line_62'>      occupied four of the greatest cities of Anatolia. The Christian</a>
<a id='line_63'>      inhabitants have expressed a wish of returning to their</a>
<a id='line_64'>      allegiance and religion; but the forces and revenues of the</a>
<a id='line_65'>      emperor are insufficient for their deliverance: and the Roman</a>
<a id='line_66'>      legate must be accompanied, or preceded, by an army of Franks, to</a>
<a id='line_67'>      expel the infidels, and open a way to the holy sepulchre.” If the</a>
<a id='line_68'>      suspicious Latins should require some pledge, some previous</a>
<a id='line_69'>      effect of the sincerity of the Greeks, the answers of Barlaam</a>
<a id='line_70'>      were perspicuous and rational. “_1._ A general synod can alone</a>
<a id='line_71'>      consummate the union of the churches; nor can such a synod be</a>
<a id='line_72'>      held till the three Oriental patriarchs, and a great number of</a>
<a id='line_73'>      bishops, are enfranchised from the Mahometan yoke. _2._ The</a>
<a id='line_74'>      Greeks are alienated by a long series of oppression and injury:</a>
<a id='line_75'>      they must be reconciled by some act of brotherly love, some</a>
<a id='line_76'>      effectual succor, which may fortify the authority and arguments</a>
<a id='line_77'>      of the emperor, and the friends of the union. _3._ If some</a>
<a id='line_78'>      difference of faith or ceremonies should be found incurable, the</a>
<a id='line_79'>      Greeks, however, are the disciples of Christ; and the Turks are</a>
<a id='line_80'>      the common enemies of the Christian name. The Armenians,</a>
<a id='line_81'>      Cyprians, and Rhodians, are equally attacked; and it will become</a>
<a id='line_82'>      the piety of the French princes to draw their swords in the</a>
<a id='line_83'>      general defence of religion. _4._ Should the subjects of</a>
<a id='line_84'>      Andronicus be treated as the worst of schismatics, of heretics,</a>
<a id='line_85'>      of pagans, a judicious policy may yet instruct the powers of the</a>
<a id='line_86'>      West to embrace a useful ally, to uphold a sinking empire, to</a>
<a id='line_87'>      guard the confines of Europe; and rather to join the Greeks</a>
<a id='line_88'>      against the Turks, than to expect the union of the Turkish arms</a>
<a id='line_89'>      with the troops and treasures of captive Greece.” The reasons,</a>
<a id='line_90'>      the offers, and the demands, of Andronicus were eluded with cold</a>
<a id='line_91'>      and stately indifference. The kings of France and Naples declined</a>
<a id='line_92'>      the dangers and glory of a crusade; the pope refused to call a</a>
<a id='line_93'>      new synod to determine old articles of faith; and his regard for</a>
<a id='line_94'>      the obsolete claims of the Latin emperor and clergy engaged him</a>
<a id='line_95'>      to use an offensive superscription,—“To the _moderator_ 2 of the</a>
<a id='line_96'>      Greeks, and the persons who style themselves the patriarchs of</a>
<a id='line_97'>      the Eastern churches.” For such an embassy, a time and character</a>
<a id='line_98'>      less propitious could not easily have been found. Benedict the</a>
<a id='line_99'>      Twelfth 3 was a dull peasant, perplexed with scruples, and</a>
<a id='line_100'>      immersed in sloth and wine: his pride might enrich with a third</a>
<a id='line_101'>      crown the papal tiara, but he was alike unfit for the regal and</a>
<a id='line_102'>      the pastoral office.</a>

<a id='line_127'>      Bibamus papaliter.]</a>
<a id='line_128'></a>
<a id='line_129'>      After the decease of Andronicus, while the Greeks were distracted</a>
<a id='line_130'>      by intestine war, they could not presume to agitate a general</a>
<a id='line_131'>      union of the Christians. But as soon as Cantacuzene had subdued</a>
<a id='line_132'>      and pardoned his enemies, he was anxious to justify, or at least</a>
<a id='line_133'>      to extenuate, the introduction of the Turks into Europe, and the</a>
<a id='line_134'>      nuptials of his daughter with a Mussulman prince. Two officers of</a>
<a id='line_135'>      state, with a Latin interpreter, were sent in his name to the</a>
<a id='line_136'>      Roman court, which was transplanted to Avignon, on the banks of</a>
<a id='line_137'>      the Rhône, during a period of seventy years: they represented the</a>
<a id='line_138'>      hard necessity which had urged him to embrace the alliance of the</a>
<a id='line_139'>      miscreants, and pronounced by his command the specious and</a>
<a id='line_140'>      edifying sounds of union and crusade. Pope Clement the Sixth, 4</a>
<a id='line_141'>      the successor of Benedict, received them with hospitality and</a>
<a id='line_142'>      honor, acknowledged the innocence of their sovereign, excused his</a>
<a id='line_143'>      distress, applauded his magnanimity, and displayed a clear</a>
<a id='line_144'>      knowledge of the state and revolutions of the Greek empire, which</a>
<a id='line_145'>      he had imbibed from the honest accounts of a Savoyard lady, an</a>
<a id='line_146'>      attendant of the empress Anne. 5 If Clement was ill endowed with</a>
<a id='line_147'>      the virtues of a priest, he possessed, however, the spirit and</a>
<a id='line_148'>      magnificence of a prince, whose liberal hand distributed</a>
<a id='line_149'>      benefices and kingdoms with equal facility. Under his reign</a>
<a id='line_150'>      Avignon was the seat of pomp and pleasure: in his youth he had</a>
<a id='line_151'>      surpassed the licentiousness of a baron; and the palace, nay, the</a>
<a id='line_152'>      bed-chamber of the pope, was adorned, or polluted, by the visits</a>
<a id='line_153'>      of his female favorites. The wars of France and England were</a>
<a id='line_154'>      adverse to the holy enterprise; but his vanity was amused by the</a>
<a id='line_155'>      splendid idea; and the Greek ambassadors returned with two Latin</a>
<a id='line_156'>      bishops, the ministers of the pontiff. On their arrival at</a>
<a id='line_157'>      Constantinople, the emperor and the nuncios admired each other’s</a>
<a id='line_158'>      piety and eloquence; and their frequent conferences were filled</a>
<a id='line_159'>      with mutual praises and promises, by which both parties were</a>
<a id='line_160'>      amused, and neither could be deceived. “I am delighted,” said the</a>
<a id='line_161'>      devout Cantacuzene, “with the project of our holy war, which must</a>
<a id='line_162'>      redound to my personal glory, as well as to the public benefit of</a>
<a id='line_163'>      Christendom. My dominions will give a free passage to the armies</a>
<a id='line_164'>      of France: my troops, my galleys, my treasures, shall be</a>
<a id='line_165'>      consecrated to the common cause; and happy would be my fate,</a>
<a id='line_166'>      could I deserve and obtain the crown of martyrdom. Words are</a>
<a id='line_167'>      insufficient to express the ardor with which I sigh for the</a>
<a id='line_168'>      reunion of the scattered members of Christ. If my death could</a>
<a id='line_169'>      avail, I would gladly present my sword and my neck: if the</a>
<a id='line_170'>      spiritual phnix could arise from my ashes, I would erect the</a>
<a id='line_171'>      pile, and kindle the flame with my own hands.” Yet the Greek</a>
<a id='line_172'>      emperor presumed to observe, that the articles of faith which</a>
<a id='line_173'>      divided the two churches had been introduced by the pride and</a>
<a id='line_174'>      precipitation of the Latins: he disclaimed the servile and</a>
<a id='line_175'>      arbitrary steps of the first Palæologus; and firmly declared,</a>
<a id='line_176'>      that he would never submit his conscience unless to the decrees</a>
<a id='line_177'>      of a free and universal synod. “The situation of the times,”</a>
<a id='line_178'>      continued he, “will not allow the pope and myself to meet either</a>
<a id='line_179'>      at Rome or Constantinople; but some maritime city may be chosen</a>
<a id='line_180'>      on the verge of the two empires, to unite the bishops, and to</a>
<a id='line_181'>      instruct the faithful, of the East and West.” The nuncios seemed</a>
<a id='line_182'>      content with the proposition; and Cantacuzene affects to deplore</a>
<a id='line_183'>      the failure of his hopes, which were soon overthrown by the death</a>
<a id='line_184'>      of Clement, and the different temper of his successor. His own</a>
<a id='line_185'>      life was prolonged, but it was prolonged in a cloister; and,</a>
<a id='line_186'>      except by his prayers, the humble monk was incapable of directing</a>
<a id='line_187'>      the counsels of his pupil or the state. 6</a>

<a id='line_206'></a>
<a id='line_207'>      Yet of all the Byzantine princes, that pupil, John Palæologus,</a>
<a id='line_208'>      was the best disposed to embrace, to believe, and to obey, the</a>
<a id='line_209'>      shepherd of the West. His mother, Anne of Savoy, was baptized in</a>
<a id='line_210'>      the bosom of the Latin church: her marriage with Andronicus</a>
<a id='line_211'>      imposed a change of name, of apparel, and of worship, but her</a>
<a id='line_212'>      heart was still faithful to her country and religion: she had</a>
<a id='line_213'>      formed the infancy of her son, and she governed the emperor,</a>
<a id='line_214'>      after his mind, or at least his stature, was enlarged to the size</a>
<a id='line_215'>      of man. In the first year of his deliverance and restoration, the</a>
<a id='line_216'>      Turks were still masters of the Hellespont; the son of</a>
<a id='line_217'>      Cantacuzene was in arms at Adrianople; and Palæologus could</a>
<a id='line_218'>      depend neither on himself nor on his people. By his mother’s</a>
<a id='line_219'>      advice, and in the hope of foreign aid, he abjured the rights</a>
<a id='line_220'>      both of the church and state; and the act of slavery, 7</a>
<a id='line_221'>      subscribed in purple ink, and sealed with the _golden_ bull, was</a>
<a id='line_222'>      privately intrusted to an Italian agent. The first article of the</a>
<a id='line_223'>      treaty is an oath of fidelity and obedience to Innocent the Sixth</a>
<a id='line_224'>      and his successors, the supreme pontiffs of the Roman and</a>
<a id='line_225'>      Catholic church. The emperor promises to entertain with due</a>
<a id='line_226'>      reverence their legates and nuncios; to assign a palace for their</a>
<a id='line_227'>      residence, and a temple for their worship; and to deliver his</a>
<a id='line_228'>      second son Manuel as the hostage of his faith. For these</a>
<a id='line_229'>      condescensions he requires a prompt succor of fifteen galleys,</a>
<a id='line_230'>      with five hundred men at arms, and a thousand archers, to serve</a>
<a id='line_231'>      against his Christian and Mussulman enemies. Palæologus engages</a>
<a id='line_232'>      to impose on his clergy and people the same spiritual yoke; but</a>
<a id='line_233'>      as the resistance of the Greeks might be justly foreseen, he</a>
<a id='line_234'>      adopts the two effectual methods of corruption and education. The</a>
<a id='line_235'>      legate was empowered to distribute the vacant benefices among the</a>
<a id='line_236'>      ecclesiastics who should subscribe the creed of the Vatican:</a>
<a id='line_237'>      three schools were instituted to instruct the youth of</a>
<a id='line_238'>      Constantinople in the language and doctrine of the Latins; and</a>
<a id='line_239'>      the name of Andronicus, the heir of the empire, was enrolled as</a>
<a id='line_240'>      the first student. Should he fail in the measures of persuasion</a>
<a id='line_241'>      or force, Palæologus declares himself unworthy to reign;</a>
<a id='line_242'>      transferred to the pope all regal and paternal authority; and</a>
<a id='line_243'>      invests Innocent with full power to regulate the family, the</a>
<a id='line_244'>      government, and the marriage, of his son and successor. But this</a>

<a id='line_257'>      hope of being the last devoured by the savage. In this abject</a>
<a id='line_258'>      state, Palæologus embraced the resolution of embarking for</a>
<a id='line_259'>      Venice, and casting himself at the feet of the pope: he was the</a>
<a id='line_260'>      first of the Byzantine princes who had ever visited the unknown</a>
<a id='line_261'>      regions of the West, yet in them alone he could seek consolation</a>
<a id='line_262'>      or relief; and with less violation of his dignity he might appear</a>
<a id='line_263'>      in the sacred college than at the Ottoman _Porte_. After a long</a>
<a id='line_264'>      absence, the Roman pontiffs were returning from Avignon to the</a>
<a id='line_265'>      banks of the Tyber: Urban the Fifth, 8 of a mild and virtuous</a>
<a id='line_266'>      character, encouraged or allowed the pilgrimage of the Greek</a>
<a id='line_267'>      prince; and, within the same year, enjoyed the glory of receiving</a>
<a id='line_268'>      in the Vatican the two Imperial shadows who represented the</a>
<a id='line_269'>      majesty of Constantine and Charlemagne. In this suppliant visit,</a>
<a id='line_270'>      the emperor of Constantinople, whose vanity was lost in his</a>
<a id='line_271'>      distress, gave more than could be expected of empty sounds and</a>
<a id='line_272'>      formal submissions. A previous trial was imposed; and, in the</a>
<a id='line_273'>      presence of four cardinals, he acknowledged, as a true Catholic,</a>
<a id='line_274'>      the supremacy of the pope, and the double procession of the Holy</a>
<a id='line_275'>      Ghost. After this purification, he was introduced to a public</a>
<a id='line_276'>      audience in the church of St. Peter: Urban, in the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_277'>      cardinals, was seated on his throne; the Greek monarch, after</a>
<a id='line_278'>      three genuflections, devoutly kissed the feet, the hands, and at</a>
<a id='line_279'>      length the mouth, of the holy father, who celebrated high mass in</a>
<a id='line_280'>      his presence, allowed him to lead the bridle of his mule, and</a>
<a id='line_281'>      treated him with a sumptuous banquet in the Vatican. The</a>
<a id='line_282'>      entertainment of Palæologus was friendly and honorable; yet some</a>
<a id='line_283'>      difference was observed between the emperors of the East and</a>
<a id='line_284'>      West; 9 nor could the former be entitled to the rare privilege of</a>
<a id='line_285'>      chanting the gospel in the rank of a deacon. 10 In favor of his</a>
<a id='line_286'>      proselyte, Urban strove to rekindle the zeal of the French king</a>
<a id='line_287'>      and the other powers of the West; but he found them cold in the</a>
<a id='line_288'>      general cause, and active only in their domestic quarrels. The</a>
<a id='line_289'>      last hope of the emperor was in an English mercenary, John</a>
<a id='line_290'>      Hawkwood, 11 or Acuto, who, with a band of adventurers, the white</a>
<a id='line_291'>      brotherhood, had ravaged Italy from the Alps to Calabria; sold</a>
<a id='line_292'>      his services to the hostile states; and incurred a just</a>
<a id='line_293'>      excommunication by shooting his arrows against the papal</a>
<a id='line_294'>      residence. A special license was granted to negotiate with the</a>
<a id='line_295'>      outlaw, but the forces, or the spirit, of Hawkwood, were unequal</a>
<a id='line_296'>      to the enterprise: and it was for the advantage, perhaps, of</a>
<a id='line_297'>      Palæologus to be disappointed of succor, that must have been</a>
<a id='line_298'>      costly, that could not be effectual, and which might have been</a>
<a id='line_299'>      dangerous. 12 The disconsolate Greek 13 prepared for his return,</a>
<a id='line_300'>      but even his return was impeded by a most ignominious obstacle.</a>
<a id='line_301'>      On his arrival at Venice, he had borrowed large sums at</a>
<a id='line_302'>      exorbitant usury; but his coffers were empty, his creditors were</a>
<a id='line_303'>      impatient, and his person was detained as the best security for</a>
<a id='line_304'>      the payment. His eldest son, Andronicus, the regent of</a>
<a id='line_305'>      Constantinople, was repeatedly urged to exhaust every resource;</a>
<a id='line_306'>      and even by stripping the churches, to extricate his father from</a>
<a id='line_307'>      captivity and disgrace. But the unnatural youth was insensible of</a>
<a id='line_308'>      the disgrace, and secretly pleased with the captivity of the</a>
<a id='line_309'>      emperor: the state was poor, the clergy were obstinate; nor could</a>
<a id='line_310'>      some religious scruple be wanting to excuse the guilt of his</a>
<a id='line_311'>      indifference and delay. Such undutiful neglect was severely</a>
<a id='line_312'>      reproved by the piety of his brother Manuel, who instantly sold</a>
<a id='line_313'>      or mortgaged all that he possessed, embarked for Venice, relieved</a>
<a id='line_314'>      his father, and pledged his own freedom to be responsible for the</a>
<a id='line_315'>      debt. On his return to Constantinople, the parent and king</a>
<a id='line_316'>      distinguished his two sons with suitable rewards; but the faith</a>
<a id='line_317'>      and manners of the slothful Palæologus had not been improved by</a>
<a id='line_318'>      his Roman pilgrimage; and his apostasy or conversion, devoid of</a>
<a id='line_319'>      any spiritual or temporal effects, was speedily forgotten by the</a>

<a id='line_379'>      thought that the presence of a distressed monarch would draw</a>

<a id='line_381'>      marshal who advised the journey prepared the reception of the</a>
<a id='line_382'>      Byzantine prince. The land was occupied by the Turks; but the</a>
<a id='line_383'>      navigation of Venice was safe and open: Italy received him as the</a>
<a id='line_384'>      first, or, at least, as the second, of the Christian princes;</a>
<a id='line_385'>      Manuel was pitied as the champion and confessor of the faith; and</a>
<a id='line_386'>      the dignity of his behavior prevented that pity from sinking into</a>
<a id='line_387'>      contempt. From Venice he proceeded to Padua and Pavia; and even</a>
<a id='line_388'>      the duke of Milan, a secret ally of Bajazet, gave him safe and</a>
<a id='line_389'>      honorable conduct to the verge of his dominions. 17 On the</a>
<a id='line_390'>      confines of France 18 the royal officers undertook the care of</a>
<a id='line_391'>      his person, journey, and expenses; and two thousand of the</a>
<a id='line_392'>      richest citizens, in arms and on horseback, came forth to meet</a>
<a id='line_393'>      him as far as Charenton, in the neighborhood of the capital. At</a>
<a id='line_394'>      the gates of Paris, he was saluted by the chancellor and the</a>
<a id='line_395'>      parliament; and Charles the Sixth, attended by his princes and</a>
<a id='line_396'>      nobles, welcomed his brother with a cordial embrace. The</a>
<a id='line_397'>      successor of Constantine was clothed in a robe of white silk, and</a>
<a id='line_398'>      mounted on a milk-white steed, a circumstance, in the French</a>
<a id='line_399'>      ceremonial, of singular importance: the white color is considered</a>
<a id='line_400'>      as the symbol of sovereignty; and, in a late visit, the German</a>
<a id='line_401'>      emperor, after a haughty demand and a peevish refusal, had been</a>
<a id='line_402'>      reduced to content himself with a black courser. Manuel was</a>
<a id='line_403'>      lodged in the Louvre; a succession of feasts and balls, the</a>
<a id='line_404'>      pleasures of the banquet and the chase, were ingeniously varied</a>
<a id='line_405'>      by the politeness of the French, to display their magnificence,</a>
<a id='line_406'>      and amuse his grief: he was indulged in the liberty of his</a>
<a id='line_407'>      chapel; and the doctors of the Sorbonne were astonished, and</a>
<a id='line_408'>      possibly scandalized, by the language, the rites, and the</a>
<a id='line_409'>      vestments, of his Greek clergy. But the slightest glance on the</a>
<a id='line_410'>      state of the kingdom must teach him to despair of any effectual</a>
<a id='line_411'>      assistance. The unfortunate Charles, though he enjoyed some lucid</a>
<a id='line_412'>      intervals, continually relapsed into furious or stupid insanity:</a>
<a id='line_413'>      the reins of government were alternately seized by his brother</a>
<a id='line_414'>      and uncle, the dukes of Orleans and Burgundy, whose factious</a>
<a id='line_415'>      competition prepared the miseries of civil war. The former was a</a>
<a id='line_416'>      gay youth, dissolved in luxury and love: the latter was the</a>
<a id='line_417'>      father of John count of Nevers, who had so lately been ransomed</a>
<a id='line_418'>      from Turkish captivity; and, if the fearless son was ardent to</a>
<a id='line_419'>      revenge his defeat, the more prudent Burgundy was content with</a>
<a id='line_420'>      the cost and peril of the first experiment. When Manuel had</a>
<a id='line_421'>      satiated the curiosity, and perhaps fatigued the patience, of the</a>
<a id='line_422'>      French, he resolved on a visit to the adjacent island. In his</a>
<a id='line_423'>      progress from Dover, he was entertained at Canterbury with due</a>
<a id='line_424'>      reverence by the prior and monks of St. Austin; and, on</a>
<a id='line_425'>      Blackheath, King Henry the Fourth, with the English court,</a>
<a id='line_426'>      saluted the Greek hero, (I copy our old historian,) who, during</a>
<a id='line_427'>      many days, was lodged and treated in London as emperor of the</a>
<a id='line_428'>      East. 19 But the state of England was still more adverse to the</a>
<a id='line_429'>      design of the holy war. In the same year, the hereditary</a>
<a id='line_430'>      sovereign had been deposed and murdered: the reigning prince was</a>
<a id='line_431'>      a successful usurper, whose ambition was punished by jealousy and</a>
<a id='line_432'>      remorse: nor could Henry of Lancaster withdraw his person or</a>
<a id='line_433'>      forces from the defence of a throne incessantly shaken by</a>
<a id='line_434'>      conspiracy and rebellion. He pitied, he praised, he feasted, the</a>
<a id='line_435'>      emperor of Constantinople; but if the English monarch assumed the</a>
<a id='line_436'>      cross, it was only to appease his people, and perhaps his</a>
<a id='line_437'>      conscience, by the merit or semblance of his pious intention. 20</a>
<a id='line_438'>      Satisfied, however, with gifts and honors, Manuel returned to</a>
<a id='line_439'>      Paris; and, after a residence of two years in the West, shaped</a>
<a id='line_440'>      his course through Germany and Italy, embarked at Venice, and</a>
<a id='line_441'>      patiently expected, in the Morea, the moment of his ruin or</a>
<a id='line_442'>      deliverance. Yet he had escaped the ignominious necessity of</a>
<a id='line_443'>      offering his religion to public or private sale. The Latin church</a>
<a id='line_444'>      was distracted by the great schism; the kings, the nations, the</a>
<a id='line_445'>      universities, of Europe were divided in their obedience between</a>
<a id='line_446'>      the popes of Rome and Avignon; and the emperor, anxious to</a>
<a id='line_447'>      conciliate the friendship of both parties, abstained from any</a>
<a id='line_448'>      correspondence with the indigent and unpopular rivals. His</a>
<a id='line_449'>      journey coincided with the year of the jubilee; but he passed</a>
<a id='line_450'>      through Italy without desiring, or deserving, the plenary</a>

<a id='line_499'></a>
<a id='line_500'>      During the period of the crusades, the Greeks beheld with</a>
<a id='line_501'>      astonishment and terror the perpetual stream of emigration that</a>
<a id='line_502'>      flowed, and continued to flow, from the unknown climates of their</a>
<a id='line_503'>      West. The visits of their last emperors removed the veil of</a>
<a id='line_504'>      separation, and they disclosed to their eyes the powerful nations</a>
<a id='line_505'>      of Europe, whom they no longer presumed to brand with the name of</a>
<a id='line_506'>      Barbarians. The observations of Manuel, and his more inquisitive</a>
<a id='line_507'>      followers, have been preserved by a Byzantine historian of the</a>
<a id='line_508'>      times: 22 his scattered ideas I shall collect and abridge; and it</a>
<a id='line_509'>      may be amusing enough, perhaps instructive, to contemplate the</a>
<a id='line_510'>      rude pictures of Germany, France, and England, whose ancient and</a>
<a id='line_511'>      modern state are so familiar to _our_ minds. I. Germany (says the</a>
<a id='line_512'>      Greek Chalcondyles) is of ample latitude from Vienna to the</a>
<a id='line_513'>      ocean; and it stretches (a strange geography) from Prague in</a>
<a id='line_514'>      Bohemia to the River Tartessus, and the Pyrenæan Mountains. 23</a>
<a id='line_515'>      The soil, except in figs and olives, is sufficiently fruitful;</a>
<a id='line_516'>      the air is salubrious; the bodies of the natives are robust and</a>
<a id='line_517'>      healthy; and these cold regions are seldom visited with the</a>
<a id='line_518'>      calamities of pestilence, or earthquakes. After the Scythians or</a>
<a id='line_519'>      Tartars, the Germans are the most numerous of nations: they are</a>
<a id='line_520'>      brave and patient; and were they united under a single head,</a>
<a id='line_521'>      their force would be irresistible. By the gift of the pope, they</a>
<a id='line_522'>      have acquired the privilege of choosing the Roman emperor; 24 nor</a>
<a id='line_523'>      is any people more devoutly attached to the faith and obedience</a>
<a id='line_524'>      of the Latin patriarch. The greatest part of the country is</a>
<a id='line_525'>      divided among the princes and prelates; but Strasburg, Cologne,</a>
<a id='line_526'>      Hamburgh, and more than two hundred free cities, are governed by</a>
<a id='line_527'>      sage and equal laws, according to the will, and for the</a>
<a id='line_528'>      advantage, of the whole community. The use of duels, or single</a>
<a id='line_529'>      combats on foot, prevails among them in peace and war: their</a>
<a id='line_530'>      industry excels in all the mechanic arts; and the Germans may</a>
<a id='line_531'>      boast of the invention of gunpowder and cannon, which is now</a>
<a id='line_532'>      diffused over the greatest part of the world. II. The kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_533'>      France is spread above fifteen or twenty days’ journey from</a>
<a id='line_534'>      Germany to Spain, and from the Alps to the British Ocean;</a>
<a id='line_535'>      containing many flourishing cities, and among these Paris, the</a>
<a id='line_536'>      seat of the king, which surpasses the rest in riches and luxury.</a>
<a id='line_537'>      Many princes and lords alternately wait in his palace, and</a>
<a id='line_538'>      acknowledge him as their sovereign: the most powerful are the</a>
<a id='line_539'>      dukes of Bretagne and Burgundy; of whom the latter possesses the</a>
<a id='line_540'>      wealthy province of Flanders, whose harbors are frequented by the</a>
<a id='line_541'>      ships and merchants of our own, and the more remote, seas. The</a>
<a id='line_542'>      French are an ancient and opulent people; and their language and</a>
<a id='line_543'>      manners, though somewhat different, are not dissimilar from those</a>
<a id='line_544'>      of the Italians. Vain of the Imperial dignity of Charlemagne, of</a>
<a id='line_545'>      their victories over the Saracens, and of the exploits of their</a>
<a id='line_546'>      heroes, Oliver and Rowland, 25 they esteem themselves the first</a>
<a id='line_547'>      of the western nations; but this foolish arrogance has been</a>
<a id='line_548'>      recently humbled by the unfortunate events of their wars against</a>
<a id='line_549'>      the English, the inhabitants of the British island. III. Britain,</a>
<a id='line_550'>      in the ocean, and opposite to the shores of Flanders, may be</a>
<a id='line_551'>      considered either as one, or as three islands; but the whole is</a>
<a id='line_552'>      united by a common interest, by the same manners, and by a</a>
<a id='line_553'>      similar government. The measure of its circumference is five</a>
<a id='line_554'>      thousand stadia: the land is overspread with towns and villages:</a>
<a id='line_555'>      though destitute of wine, and not abounding in fruit-trees, it is</a>
<a id='line_556'>      fertile in wheat and barley; in honey and wool; and much cloth is</a>
<a id='line_557'>      manufactured by the inhabitants. In populousness and power, in</a>
<a id='line_558'>      richness and luxury, London, 26 the metropolis of the isle, may</a>
<a id='line_559'>      claim a preeminence over all the cities of the West. It is</a>
<a id='line_560'>      situate on the Thames, a broad and rapid river, which at the</a>
<a id='line_561'>      distance of thirty miles falls into the Gallic Sea; and the daily</a>
<a id='line_562'>      flow and ebb of the tide affords a safe entrance and departure to</a>
<a id='line_563'>      the vessels of commerce. The king is head of a powerful and</a>
<a id='line_564'>      turbulent aristocracy: his principal vassals hold their estates</a>
<a id='line_565'>      by a free and unalterable tenure; and the laws define the limits</a>
<a id='line_566'>      of his authority and their obedience. The kingdom has been often</a>
<a id='line_567'>      afflicted by foreign conquest and domestic sedition: but the</a>
<a id='line_568'>      natives are bold and hardy, renowned in arms and victorious in</a>
<a id='line_569'>      war. The form of their shields or targets is derived from the</a>
<a id='line_570'>      Italians, that of their swords from the Greeks; the use of the</a>
<a id='line_571'>      long bow is the peculiar and decisive advantage of the English.</a>
<a id='line_572'>      Their language bears no affinity to the idioms of the Continent:</a>
<a id='line_573'>      in the habits of domestic life, they are not easily distinguished</a>
<a id='line_574'>      from their neighbors of France: but the most singular</a>
<a id='line_575'>      circumstance of their manners is their disregard of conjugal</a>
<a id='line_576'>      honor and of female chastity. In their mutual visits, as the</a>
<a id='line_577'>      first act of hospitality, the guest is welcomed in the embraces</a>
<a id='line_578'>      of their wives and daughters: among friends they are lent and</a>
<a id='line_579'>      borrowed without shame; nor are the islanders offended at this</a>

<a id='line_656'>      After his return, and the victory of Timour, Manuel reigned many</a>
<a id='line_657'>      years in prosperity and peace. As long as the sons of Bajazet</a>
<a id='line_658'>      solicited his friendship and spared his dominions, he was</a>
<a id='line_659'>      satisfied with the national religion; and his leisure was</a>
<a id='line_660'>      employed in composing twenty theological dialogues for its</a>
<a id='line_661'>      defence. The appearance of the Byzantine ambassadors at the</a>
<a id='line_662'>      council of Constance, 30 announces the restoration of the Turkish</a>
<a id='line_663'>      power, as well as of the Latin church: the conquest of the</a>
<a id='line_664'>      sultans, Mahomet and Amurath, reconciled the emperor to the</a>
<a id='line_665'>      Vatican; and the siege of Constantinople almost tempted him to</a>
<a id='line_666'>      acquiesce in the double procession of the Holy Ghost. When Martin</a>
<a id='line_667'>      the Fifth ascended without a rival the chair of St. Peter, a</a>
<a id='line_668'>      friendly intercourse of letters and embassies was revived between</a>
<a id='line_669'>      the East and West. Ambition on one side, and distress on the</a>
<a id='line_670'>      other, dictated the same decent language of charity and peace:</a>
<a id='line_671'>      the artful Greek expressed a desire of marrying his six sons to</a>
<a id='line_672'>      Italian princesses; and the Roman, not less artful, despatched</a>
<a id='line_673'>      the daughter of the marquis of Montferrat, with a company of</a>
<a id='line_674'>      noble virgins, to soften, by their charms, the obstinacy of the</a>
<a id='line_675'>      schismatics. Yet under this mask of zeal, a discerning eye will</a>
<a id='line_676'>      perceive that all was hollow and insincere in the court and</a>
<a id='line_677'>      church of Constantinople. According to the vicissitudes of danger</a>
<a id='line_678'>      and repose, the emperor advanced or retreated; alternately</a>
<a id='line_679'>      instructed and disavowed his ministers; and escaped from the</a>
<a id='line_680'>      importunate pressure by urging the duty of inquiry, the</a>
<a id='line_681'>      obligation of collecting the sense of his patriarchs and bishops,</a>
<a id='line_682'>      and the impossibility of convening them at a time when the</a>
<a id='line_683'>      Turkish arms were at the gates of his capital. From a review of</a>
<a id='line_684'>      the public transactions it will appear that the Greeks insisted</a>
<a id='line_685'>      on three successive measures, a succor, a council, and a final</a>
<a id='line_686'>      reunion, while the Latins eluded the second, and only promised</a>
<a id='line_687'>      the first, as a consequential and voluntary reward of the third.</a>
<a id='line_688'>      But we have an opportunity of unfolding the most secret</a>
<a id='line_689'>      intentions of Manuel, as he explained them in a private</a>
<a id='line_690'>      conversation without artifice or disguise. In his declining age,</a>
<a id='line_691'>      the emperor had associated John Palæologus, the second of the</a>
<a id='line_692'>      name, and the eldest of his sons, on whom he devolved the</a>
<a id='line_693'>      greatest part of the authority and weight of government. One day,</a>
<a id='line_694'>      in the presence only of the historian Phranza, 31 his favorite</a>
<a id='line_695'>      chamberlain, he opened to his colleague and successor the true</a>
<a id='line_696'>      principle of his negotiations with the pope. 32 “Our last</a>
<a id='line_697'>      resource,” said Manuel, against the Turks, “is their fear of our</a>
<a id='line_698'>      union with the Latins, of the warlike nations of the West, who</a>
<a id='line_699'>      may arm for our relief and for their destruction. As often as you</a>
<a id='line_700'>      are threatened by the miscreants, present this danger before</a>
<a id='line_701'>      their eyes. Propose a council; consult on the means; but ever</a>
<a id='line_702'>      delay and avoid the convocation of an assembly, which cannot tend</a>
<a id='line_703'>      either to our spiritual or temporal emolument. The Latins are</a>
<a id='line_704'>      proud; the Greeks are obstinate; neither party will recede or</a>
<a id='line_705'>      retract; and the attempt of a perfect union will confirm the</a>
<a id='line_706'>      schism, alienate the churches, and leave us, without hope or</a>
<a id='line_707'>      defence, at the mercy of the Barbarians.” Impatient of this</a>
<a id='line_708'>      salutary lesson, the royal youth arose from his seat, and</a>
<a id='line_709'>      departed in silence; and the wise monarch (continued Phranza)</a>
<a id='line_710'>      casting his eyes on me, thus resumed his discourse: “My son deems</a>
<a id='line_711'>      himself a great and heroic prince; but, alas! our miserable age</a>
<a id='line_712'>      does not afford scope for heroism or greatness. His daring spirit</a>
<a id='line_713'>      might have suited the happier times of our ancestors; but the</a>
<a id='line_714'>      present state requires not an emperor, but a cautious steward of</a>
<a id='line_715'>      the last relics of our fortunes. Well do I remember the lofty</a>
<a id='line_716'>      expectations which he built on our alliance with Mustapha; and</a>
<a id='line_717'>      much do I fear, that this rash courage will urge the ruin of our</a>
<a id='line_718'>      house, and that even religion may precipitate our downfall.” Yet</a>
<a id='line_719'>      the experience and authority of Manuel preserved the peace, and</a>
<a id='line_720'>      eluded the council; till, in the seventy-eighth year of his age,</a>
<a id='line_721'>      and in the habit of a monk, he terminated his career, dividing</a>
<a id='line_722'>      his precious movables among his children and the poor, his</a>
<a id='line_723'>      physicians and his favorite servants. Of his six sons, 33</a>
<a id='line_724'>      Andronicus the Second was invested with the principality of</a>
<a id='line_725'>      Thessalonica, and died of a leprosy soon after the sale of that</a>
<a id='line_726'>      city to the Venetians and its final conquest by the Turks. Some</a>
<a id='line_727'>      fortunate incidents had restored Peloponnesus, or the Morea, to</a>
<a id='line_728'>      the empire; and in his more prosperous days, Manuel had fortified</a>
<a id='line_729'>      the narrow isthmus of six miles 34 with a stone wall and one</a>
<a id='line_730'>      hundred and fifty-three towers. The wall was overthrown by the</a>

<a id='line_804'>      exposed to the tyranny of their deliverer; and his sacred</a>
<a id='line_805'>      character was invulnerable to those arms which they found so keen</a>
<a id='line_806'>      and effectual against the civil magistrate. Their great charter,</a>

<a id='line_808'>      trusts or commendams, disappointed by reversionary grants, and</a>
<a id='line_809'>      superseded by previous and arbitrary reservations. 36 A public</a>
<a id='line_810'>      auction was instituted in the court of Rome: the cardinals and</a>
<a id='line_811'>      favorites were enriched with the spoils of nations; and every</a>
<a id='line_812'>      country might complain that the most important and valuable</a>
<a id='line_813'>      benefices were accumulated on the heads of aliens and absentees.</a>
<a id='line_814'>      During their residence at Avignon, the ambition of the popes</a>
<a id='line_815'>      subsided in the meaner passions of avarice 37 and luxury: they</a>
<a id='line_816'>      rigorously imposed on the clergy the tributes of first-fruits and</a>

<a id='line_818'>      and corruption. These manifold scandals were aggravated by the</a>
<a id='line_819'>      great schism of the West, which continued above fifty years. In</a>
<a id='line_820'>      the furious conflicts of Rome and Avignon, the vices of the</a>
<a id='line_821'>      rivals were mutually exposed; and their precarious situation</a>
<a id='line_822'>      degraded their authority, relaxed their discipline, and</a>

<a id='line_826'>      assemblies, conscious of their strength, resolved to vindicate</a>

<a id='line_828'>      sentence against two pontiffs, whom they rejected, and a third,</a>
<a id='line_829'>      their acknowledged sovereign, whom they deposed, the fathers of</a>
<a id='line_830'>      Constance proceeded to examine the nature and limits of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_831'>      supremacy; nor did they separate till they had established the</a>
<a id='line_832'>      authority, above the pope, of a general council. It was enacted,</a>
<a id='line_833'>      that, for the government and reformation of the church, such</a>
<a id='line_834'>      assemblies should be held at regular intervals; and that each</a>
<a id='line_835'>      synod, before its dissolution, should appoint the time and place</a>
<a id='line_836'>      of the subsequent meeting. By the influence of the court of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_837'>      the next convocation at Sienna was easily eluded; but the bold</a>
<a id='line_838'>      and vigorous proceedings of the council of Basil 39 had almost</a>
<a id='line_839'>      been fatal to the reigning pontiff, Eugenius the Fourth. A just</a>
<a id='line_840'>      suspicion of his design prompted the fathers to hasten the</a>
<a id='line_841'>      promulgation of their first decree, that the representatives of</a>
<a id='line_842'>      the church-militant on earth were invested with a divine and</a>
<a id='line_843'>      spiritual jurisdiction over all Christians, without excepting the</a>
<a id='line_844'>      pope; and that a general council could not be dissolved,</a>
<a id='line_845'>      prorogued, or transferred, unless by their free deliberation and</a>
<a id='line_846'>      consent. On the notice that Eugenius had fulminated a bull for</a>
<a id='line_847'>      that purpose, they ventured to summon, to admonish, to threaten,</a>
<a id='line_848'>      to censure the contumacious successor of St. Peter. After many</a>
<a id='line_849'>      delays, to allow time for repentance, they finally declared,</a>
<a id='line_850'>      that, unless he submitted within the term of sixty days, he was</a>
<a id='line_851'>      suspended from the exercise of all temporal and ecclesiastical</a>
<a id='line_852'>      authority. And to mark their jurisdiction over the prince as well</a>
<a id='line_853'>      as the priest, they assumed the government of Avignon, annulled</a>
<a id='line_854'>      the alienation of the sacred patrimony, and protected Rome from</a>
<a id='line_855'>      the imposition of new taxes. Their boldness was justified, not</a>
<a id='line_856'>      only by the general opinion of the clergy, but by the support and</a>
<a id='line_857'>      power of the first monarchs of Christendom: the emperor Sigismond</a>
<a id='line_858'>      declared himself the servant and protector of the synod; Germany</a>
<a id='line_859'>      and France adhered to their cause; the duke of Milan was the</a>
<a id='line_860'>      enemy of Eugenius; and he was driven from the Vatican by an</a>
<a id='line_861'>      insurrection of the Roman people. Rejected at the same time by</a>
<a id='line_862'>      temporal and spiritual subjects, submission was his only choice:</a>
<a id='line_863'>      by a most humiliating bull, the pope repealed his own acts, and</a>
<a id='line_864'>      ratified those of the council; incorporated his legates and</a>
<a id='line_865'>      cardinals with that venerable body; and _seemed_ to resign</a>
<a id='line_866'>      himself to the decrees of the supreme legislature. Their fame</a>
<a id='line_867'>      pervaded the countries of the East: and it was in their presence</a>
<a id='line_868'>      that Sigismond received the ambassadors of the Turkish sultan, 40</a>
<a id='line_869'>      who laid at his feet twelve large vases, filled with robes of</a>
<a id='line_870'>      silk and pieces of gold. The fathers of Basil aspired to the</a>
<a id='line_871'>      glory of reducing the Greeks, as well as the Bohemians, within</a>
<a id='line_872'>      the pale of the church; and their deputies invited the emperor</a>
<a id='line_873'>      and patriarch of Constantinople to unite with an assembly which</a>
<a id='line_874'>      possessed the confidence of the Western nations. Palæologus was</a>
<a id='line_875'>      not averse to the proposal; and his ambassadors were introduced</a>
<a id='line_876'>      with due honors into the Catholic senate. But the choice of the</a>
<a id='line_877'>      place appeared to be an insuperable obstacle, since he refused to</a>
<a id='line_878'>      pass the Alps, or the sea of Sicily, and positively required that</a>
<a id='line_879'>      the synod should be adjourned to some convenient city in Italy,</a>
<a id='line_880'>      or at least on the Danube. The other articles of this treaty were</a>
<a id='line_881'>      more readily stipulated: it was agreed to defray the travelling</a>
<a id='line_882'>      expenses of the emperor, with a train of seven hundred persons,</a>
<a id='line_883'>      41 to remit an immediate sum of eight thousand ducats 42 for the</a>
<a id='line_884'>      accommodation of the Greek clergy; and in his absence to grant a</a>
<a id='line_885'>      supply of ten thousand ducats, with three hundred archers and</a>
<a id='line_886'>      some galleys, for the protection of Constantinople. The city of</a>
<a id='line_887'>      Avignon advanced the funds for the preliminary expenses; and the</a>

<a id='line_944'>      and perpetual tribunal in the church. Eugenius was impatient of</a>

<a id='line_955'>      was smooth, and yielding, and respectful; and he invited the</a>
<a id='line_956'>      Byzantine monarch to heal by his presence the schism of the</a>
<a id='line_957'>      Latin, as well as of the Eastern, church. Ferrara, near the coast</a>
<a id='line_958'>      of the Adriatic, was proposed for their amicable interview; and</a>
<a id='line_959'>      with some indulgence of forgery and theft, a surreptitious decree</a>
<a id='line_960'>      was procured, which transferred the synod, with its own consent,</a>
<a id='line_961'>      to that Italian city. Nine galleys were equipped for the service</a>
<a id='line_962'>      at Venice, and in the Isle of Candia; their diligence anticipated</a>
<a id='line_963'>      the slower vessels of Basil: the Roman admiral was commissioned</a>
<a id='line_964'>      to burn, sink, and destroy; 45 and these priestly squadrons might</a>
<a id='line_965'>      have encountered each other in the same seas where Athens and</a>
<a id='line_966'>      Sparta had formerly contended for the preeminence of glory.</a>
<a id='line_967'>      Assaulted by the importunity of the factions, who were ready to</a>
<a id='line_968'>      fight for the possession of his person, Palæologus hesitated</a>
<a id='line_969'>      before he left his palace and country on a perilous experiment.</a>
<a id='line_970'>      His father’s advice still dwelt on his memory; and reason must</a>
<a id='line_971'>      suggest, that since the Latins were divided among themselves,</a>
<a id='line_972'>      they could never unite in a foreign cause. Sigismond dissuaded</a>
<a id='line_973'>      the unreasonable adventure; his advice was impartial, since he</a>
<a id='line_974'>      adhered to the council; and it was enforced by the strange</a>
<a id='line_975'>      belief, that the German Cæsar would nominate a Greek his heir and</a>
<a id='line_976'>      successor in the empire of the West. 46 Even the Turkish sultan</a>
<a id='line_977'>      was a counsellor whom it might be unsafe to trust, but whom it</a>
<a id='line_978'>      was dangerous to offend. Amurath was unskilled in the disputes,</a>
<a id='line_979'>      but he was apprehensive of the union, of the Christians. From his</a>
<a id='line_980'>      own treasures, he offered to relieve the wants of the Byzantine</a>
<a id='line_981'>      court; yet he declared with seeming magnanimity, that</a>
<a id='line_982'>      Constantinople should be secure and inviolate, in the absence of</a>
<a id='line_983'>      her sovereign. 47 The resolution of Palæologus was decided by the</a>
<a id='line_984'>      most splendid gifts and the most specious promises: he wished to</a>
<a id='line_985'>      escape for a while from a scene of danger and distress and after</a>
<a id='line_986'>      dismissing with an ambiguous answer the messengers of the</a>
<a id='line_987'>      council, he declared his intention of embarking in the Roman</a>
<a id='line_988'>      galleys. The age of the patriarch Joseph was more susceptible of</a>
<a id='line_989'>      fear than of hope; he trembled at the perils of the sea, and</a>
<a id='line_990'>      expressed his apprehension, that his feeble voice, with thirty</a>
<a id='line_991'>      perhaps of his orthodox brethren, would be oppressed in a foreign</a>
<a id='line_992'>      land by the power and numbers of a Latin synod. He yielded to the</a>
<a id='line_993'>      royal mandate, to the flattering assurance, that he would be</a>
<a id='line_994'>      heard as the oracle of nations, and to the secret wish of</a>
<a id='line_995'>      learning from his brother of the West, to deliver the church from</a>

<a id='line_1275'>      debates of twenty-five sessions, they attained the advantage and</a>
<a id='line_1276'>      glory of the reunion of the Greeks. Four principal questions had</a>
<a id='line_1277'>      been agitated between the two churches; _1._ The use of</a>
<a id='line_1278'>      unleavened bread in the communion of Christ’s body. _2._ The</a>
<a id='line_1279'>      nature of purgatory. _3._ The supremacy of the pope. And, _4._</a>
<a id='line_1280'>      The single or double procession of the Holy Ghost. The cause of</a>
<a id='line_1281'>      either nation was managed by ten theological champions: the</a>
<a id='line_1282'>      Latins were supported by the inexhaustible eloquence of Cardinal</a>
<a id='line_1283'>      Julian; and Mark of Ephesus and Bessarion of Nice were the bold</a>
<a id='line_1284'>      and able leaders of the Greek forces. We may bestow some praise</a>
<a id='line_1285'>      on the progress of human reason, by observing that the first of</a>
<a id='line_1286'>      these questions was now treated as an immaterial rite, which</a>
<a id='line_1287'>      might innocently vary with the fashion of the age and country.</a>
<a id='line_1288'>      With regard to the second, both parties were agreed in the belief</a>
<a id='line_1289'>      of an intermediate state of purgation for the venial sins of the</a>
<a id='line_1290'>      faithful; and whether their souls were purified by elemental fire</a>
<a id='line_1291'>      was a doubtful point, which in a few years might be conveniently</a>
<a id='line_1292'>      settled on the spot by the disputants. The claims of supremacy</a>
<a id='line_1293'>      appeared of a more weighty and substantial kind; yet by the</a>
<a id='line_1294'>      Orientals the Roman bishop had ever been respected as the first</a>
<a id='line_1295'>      of the five patriarchs; nor did they scruple to admit, that his</a>
<a id='line_1296'>      jurisdiction should be exercised agreeably to the holy canons; a</a>
<a id='line_1297'>      vague allowance, which might be defined or eluded by occasional</a>
<a id='line_1298'>      convenience. The procession of the Holy Ghost from the Father</a>
<a id='line_1299'>      alone, or from the Father and the Son, was an article of faith</a>
<a id='line_1300'>      which had sunk much deeper into the minds of men; and in the</a>
<a id='line_1301'>      sessions of Ferrara and Florence, the Latin addition of</a>
<a id='line_1302'>      _filioque_ was subdivided into two questions, whether it were</a>
<a id='line_1303'>      legal, and whether it were orthodox. Perhaps it may not be</a>
<a id='line_1304'>      necessary to boast on this subject of my own impartial</a>
<a id='line_1305'>      indifference; but I must think that the Greeks were strongly</a>
<a id='line_1306'>      supported by the prohibition of the council of Chalcedon, against</a>
<a id='line_1307'>      adding any article whatsoever to the creed of Nice, or rather of</a>
<a id='line_1308'>      Constantinople. 63 In earthly affairs, it is not easy to conceive</a>
<a id='line_1309'>      how an assembly equal of legislators can bind their successors</a>
<a id='line_1310'>      invested with powers equal to their own. But the dictates of</a>
<a id='line_1311'>      inspiration must be true and unchangeable; nor should a private</a>
<a id='line_1312'>      bishop, or a provincial synod, have presumed to innovate against</a>
<a id='line_1313'>      the judgment of the Catholic church. On the substance of the</a>
<a id='line_1314'>      doctrine, the controversy was equal and endless: reason is</a>
<a id='line_1315'>      confounded by the procession of a deity: the gospel, which lay on</a>
<a id='line_1316'>      the altar, was silent; the various texts of the fathers might be</a>
<a id='line_1317'>      corrupted by fraud or entangled by sophistry; and the Greeks were</a>
<a id='line_1318'>      ignorant of the characters and writings of the Latin saints. 64</a>
<a id='line_1319'>      Of this at least we may be sure, that neither side could be</a>

<a id='line_1365'>      successively moved by authority and example. Their revenues were</a>

<a id='line_1370'>      indigence, that their arrears, the payment of a debt, would be</a>
<a id='line_1371'>      accepted as a favor, and might operate as a bribe. 67 The danger</a>
<a id='line_1372'>      and relief of Constantinople might excuse some prudent and pious</a>

<a id='line_1643'>      important distinction has been already noticed: the Greeks were</a>
<a id='line_1644'>      stationary or retrograde, while the Latins were advancing with a</a>
<a id='line_1645'>      rapid and progressive motion. The nations were excited by the</a>

<a id='line_1649'>      ranks of society were relieved from the yoke of feudal servitude;</a>
<a id='line_1650'>      and freedom is the first step to curiosity and knowledge. The</a>
<a id='line_1651'>      use, however rude and corrupt, of the Latin tongue had been</a>
<a id='line_1652'>      preserved by superstition; the universities, from Bologna to</a>

<a id='line_1654'>      misguided ardor might be directed to more liberal and manly</a>
<a id='line_1655'>      studies. In the resurrection of science, Italy was the first that</a>
<a id='line_1656'>      cast away her shroud; and the eloquent Petrarch, by his lessons</a>
<a id='line_1657'>      and his example, may justly be applauded as the first harbinger</a>

<a id='line_1660'>      of the writers of ancient Rome; and the disciples of Cicero and</a>
<a id='line_1661'>      Virgil approached, with reverence and love, the sanctuary of</a>
<a id='line_1662'>      their Grecian masters. In the sack of Constantinople, the French,</a>
<a id='line_1663'>      and even the Venetians, had despised and destroyed the works of</a>

<a id='line_1729'>      Greek language; and in a laborious struggle with the dryness and</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      difficulty of the first rudiments, he began to reach the sense,</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      and to feel the spirit, of poets and philosophers, whose minds</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      were congenial to his own. But he was soon deprived of the</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      society and lessons of this useful assistant: Barlaam</a>
<a id='line_1734'>      relinquished his fruitless embassy; and, on his return to Greece,</a>
<a id='line_1735'>      he rashly provoked the swarms of fanatic monks, by attempting to</a>
<a id='line_1736'>      substitute the light of reason to that of their navel. After a</a>
<a id='line_1737'>      separation of three years, the two friends again met in the court</a>
<a id='line_1738'>      of Naples: but the generous pupil renounced the fairest occasion</a>
<a id='line_1739'>      of improvement; and by his recommendation Barlaam was finally</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      settled in a small bishopric of his native Calabria. 91 The</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      manifold avocations of Petrarch, love and friendship, his various</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      correspondence and frequent journeys, the Roman laurel, and his</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      elaborate compositions in prose and verse, in Latin and Italian,</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      diverted him from a foreign idiom; and as he advanced in life,</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      the attainment of the Greek language was the object of his wishes</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      rather than of his hopes. When he was about fifty years of age, a</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      Byzantine ambassador, his friend, and a master of both tongues,</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      presented him with a copy of Homer; and the answer of Petrarch is</a>
<a id='line_1749'>      at one expressive of his eloquence, gratitude, and regret. After</a>
<a id='line_1750'>      celebrating the generosity of the donor, and the value of a gift</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      more precious in his estimation than gold or rubies, he thus</a>
<a id='line_1752'>      proceeds: “Your present of the genuine and original text of the</a>
<a id='line_1753'>      divine poet, the fountain of all inventions, is worthy of</a>
<a id='line_1754'>      yourself and of me: you have fulfilled your promise, and</a>
<a id='line_1755'>      satisfied my desires. Yet your liberality is still imperfect:</a>
<a id='line_1756'>      with Homer you should have given me yourself; a guide, who could</a>
<a id='line_1757'>      lead me into the fields of light, and disclose to my wondering</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      eyes the spacious miracles of the Iliad and Odyssey. But, alas!</a>
<a id='line_1759'>      Homer is dumb, or I am deaf; nor is it in my power to enjoy the</a>
<a id='line_1760'>      beauty which I possess. I have seated him by the side of Plato,</a>

<a id='line_1825'>      aspire to the more serious praise of restoring in Italy the study</a>
<a id='line_1826'>      of the Greek language. In the year one thousand three hundred and</a>
<a id='line_1827'>      sixty, a disciple of Barlaam, whose name was Leo, or Leontius</a>
<a id='line_1828'>      Pilatus, was detained in his way to Avignon by the advice and</a>
<a id='line_1829'>      hospitality of Boccace, who lodged the stranger in his house,</a>
<a id='line_1830'>      prevailed on the republic of Florence to allow him an annual</a>
<a id='line_1831'>      stipend, and devoted his leisure to the first Greek professor,</a>
<a id='line_1832'>      who taught that language in the Western countries of Europe. The</a>
<a id='line_1833'>      appearance of Leo might disgust the most eager disciple, he was</a>
<a id='line_1834'>      clothed in the mantle of a philosopher, or a mendicant; his</a>
<a id='line_1835'>      countenance was hideous; his face was overshadowed with black</a>
<a id='line_1836'>      hair; his beard long and uncombed; his deportment rustic; his</a>
<a id='line_1837'>      temper gloomy and inconstant; nor could he grace his discourse</a>
<a id='line_1838'>      with the ornaments, or even the perspicuity, of Latin elocution.</a>
<a id='line_1839'>      But his mind was stored with a treasure of Greek learning:</a>
<a id='line_1840'>      history and fable, philosophy and grammar, were alike at his</a>
<a id='line_1841'>      command; and he read the poems of Homer in the schools of</a>
<a id='line_1842'>      Florence. It was from his explanation that Boccace composed 931</a>
<a id='line_1843'>      and transcribed a literal prose version of the Iliad and Odyssey,</a>
<a id='line_1844'>      which satisfied the thirst of his friend Petrarch, and which,</a>
<a id='line_1845'>      perhaps, in the succeeding century, was clandestinely used by</a>
<a id='line_1846'>      Laurentius Valla, the Latin interpreter. It was from his</a>
<a id='line_1847'>      narratives that the same Boccace collected the materials for his</a>
<a id='line_1848'>      treatise on the genealogy of the heathen gods, a work, in that</a>
<a id='line_1849'>      age, of stupendous erudition, and which he ostentatiously</a>
<a id='line_1850'>      sprinkled with Greek characters and passages, to excite the</a>
<a id='line_1851'>      wonder and applause of his more ignorant readers. 94 The first</a>
<a id='line_1852'>      steps of learning are slow and laborious; no more than ten</a>
<a id='line_1853'>      votaries of Homer could be enumerated in all Italy; and neither</a>
<a id='line_1854'>      Rome, nor Venice, nor Naples, could add a single name to this</a>
<a id='line_1855'>      studious catalogue. But their numbers would have multiplied,</a>
<a id='line_1856'>      their progress would have been accelerated, if the inconstant</a>
<a id='line_1857'>      Leo, at the end of three years, had not relinquished an honorable</a>
<a id='line_1858'>      and beneficial station. In his passage, Petrarch entertained him</a>
<a id='line_1859'>      at Padua a short time: he enjoyed the scholar, but was justly</a>
<a id='line_1860'>      offended with the gloomy and unsocial temper of the man.</a>
<a id='line_1861'>      Discontented with the world and with himself, Leo depreciated his</a>
<a id='line_1862'>      present enjoyments, while absent persons and objects were dear to</a>
<a id='line_1863'>      his imagination. In Italy he was a Thessalian, in Greece a native</a>
<a id='line_1864'>      of Calabria: in the company of the Latins he disdained their</a>
<a id='line_1865'>      language, religion, and manners: no sooner was he landed at</a>
<a id='line_1866'>      Constantinople, than he again sighed for the wealth of Venice and</a>
<a id='line_1867'>      the elegance of Florence. His Italian friends were deaf to his</a>
<a id='line_1868'>      importunity: he depended on their curiosity and indulgence, and</a>
<a id='line_1869'>      embarked on a second voyage; but on his entrance into the</a>
<a id='line_1870'>      Adriatic, the ship was assailed by a tempest, and the unfortunate</a>
<a id='line_1871'>      teacher, who like Ulysses had fastened himself to the mast, was</a>
<a id='line_1872'>      struck dead by a flash of lightning. The humane Petrarch dropped</a>
<a id='line_1873'>      a tear on his disaster; but he was most anxious to learn whether</a>

<a id='line_1908'>      the most learned, was Manuel Chrysoloras, 97 of noble birth, and</a>
<a id='line_1909'>      whose Roman ancestors are supposed to have migrated with the</a>
<a id='line_1910'>      great Constantine. After visiting the courts of France and</a>
<a id='line_1911'>      England, where he obtained some contributions and more promises,</a>
<a id='line_1912'>      the envoy was invited to assume the office of a professor; and</a>

<a id='line_1915'>      Chrysoloras deserved the stipend, and surpassed the expectation,</a>
<a id='line_1916'>      of the republic. His school was frequented by a crowd of</a>
<a id='line_1917'>      disciples of every rank and age; and one of these, in a general</a>
<a id='line_1918'>      history, has described his motives and his success. “At that</a>
<a id='line_1919'>      time,” says Leonard Aretin, 98 “I was a student of the civil law;</a>
<a id='line_1920'>      but my soul was inflamed with the love of letters; and I bestowed</a>
<a id='line_1921'>      some application on the sciences of logic and rhetoric. On the</a>
<a id='line_1922'>      arrival of Manuel, I hesitated whether I should desert my legal</a>
<a id='line_1923'>      studies, or relinquish this golden opportunity; and thus, in the</a>
<a id='line_1924'>      ardor of youth, I communed with my own mind—Wilt thou be wanting</a>
<a id='line_1925'>      to thyself and thy fortune? Wilt thou refuse to be introduced to</a>
<a id='line_1926'>      a familiar converse with Homer, Plato, and Demosthenes; with</a>
<a id='line_1927'>      those poets, philosophers, and orators, of whom such wonders are</a>

<a id='line_1931'>      teacher, and such a teacher, of the Greek language, if he once be</a>
<a id='line_1932'>      suffered to escape, may never afterwards be retrieved. Convinced</a>
<a id='line_1933'>      by these reasons, I gave myself to Chrysoloras; and so strong was</a>
<a id='line_1934'>      my passion, that the lessons which I had imbibed in the day were</a>
<a id='line_1935'>      the constant object of my nightly dreams.” 99 At the same time</a>
<a id='line_1936'>      and place, the Latin classics were explained by John of Ravenna,</a>
<a id='line_1937'>      the domestic pupil of Petrarch; 100 the Italians, who illustrated</a>

<a id='line_1939'>      Florence became the fruitful seminary of Greek and Roman</a>
<a id='line_1940'>      erudition. 101 The presence of the emperor recalled Chrysoloras</a>
<a id='line_1941'>      from the college to the court; but he afterwards taught at Pavia</a>

<a id='line_2024'>      Bessarion, whose purple they revered, and whose fortune was the</a>
<a id='line_2025'>      secret object of their envy. But the lives of these grammarians</a>
<a id='line_2026'>      were humble and obscure: they had declined the lucrative paths of</a>
<a id='line_2027'>      the church; their dress and manners secluded them from the</a>
<a id='line_2028'>      commerce of the world; and since they were confined to the merit,</a>
<a id='line_2029'>      they might be content with the rewards, of learning. From this</a>
<a id='line_2030'>      character, Janus Lascaris 105 will deserve an exception. His</a>
<a id='line_2031'>      eloquence, politeness, and Imperial descent, recommended him to</a>
<a id='line_2032'>      the French monarch; and in the same cities he was alternately</a>
<a id='line_2033'>      employed to teach and to negotiate. Duty and interest prompted</a>
<a id='line_2034'>      them to cultivate the study of the Latin language; and the most</a>
<a id='line_2035'>      successful attained the faculty of writing and speaking with</a>
<a id='line_2036'>      fluency and elegance in a foreign idiom. But they ever retained</a>
<a id='line_2037'>      the inveterate vanity of their country: their praise, or at least</a>
<a id='line_2038'>      their esteem, was reserved for the national writers, to whom they</a>
<a id='line_2039'>      owed their fame and subsistence; and they sometimes betrayed</a>
<a id='line_2040'>      their contempt in licentious criticism or satire on Virgil’s</a>
<a id='line_2041'>      poetry, and the oratory of Tully. 106 The superiority of these</a>
<a id='line_2042'>      masters arose from the familiar use of a living language; and</a>
<a id='line_2043'>      their first disciples were incapable of discerning how far they</a>
<a id='line_2044'>      had degenerated from the knowledge, and even the practice of</a>
<a id='line_2045'>      their ancestors. A vicious pronunciation, 107 which they</a>
<a id='line_2046'>      introduced, was banished from the schools by the reason of the</a>
<a id='line_2047'>      succeeding age. Of the power of the Greek accents they were</a>
<a id='line_2048'>      ignorant; and those musical notes, which, from an Attic tongue,</a>
<a id='line_2049'>      and to an Attic ear, must have been the secret soul of harmony,</a>
<a id='line_2050'>      were to their eyes, as to our own, no more than minute and</a>
<a id='line_2051'>      unmeaning marks, in prose superfluous and troublesome in verse.</a>
<a id='line_2052'>      The art of grammar they truly possessed; the valuable fragments</a>
<a id='line_2053'>      of Apollonius and Herodian were transfused into their lessons;</a>
<a id='line_2054'>      and their treatises of syntax and etymology, though devoid of</a>
<a id='line_2055'>      philosophic spirit, are still useful to the Greek student. In the</a>
<a id='line_2056'>      shipwreck of the Byzantine libraries, each fugitive seized a</a>
<a id='line_2057'>      fragment of treasure, a copy of some author, who without his</a>

<a id='line_2060'>      corrected and explained by their own comments, or those of the</a>
<a id='line_2061'>      elder scholiasts. The sense, though not the spirit, of the Greek</a>

<a id='line_2130'>      with the richest colors of poetry and eloquence. The dialogues of</a>
<a id='line_2131'>      Plato are a dramatic picture of the life and death of a sage;</a>

<a id='line_2170'>      republics to vie with each other in the encouragement and reward</a>
<a id='line_2171'>      of literature. The fame of Nicholas the Fifth 110 has not been</a>
<a id='line_2172'>      adequate to his merits. From a plebeian origin he raised himself</a>
<a id='line_2173'>      by his virtue and learning: the character of the man prevailed</a>
<a id='line_2174'>      over the interest of the pope; and he sharpened those weapons</a>
<a id='line_2175'>      which were soon pointed against the Roman church. 111 He had been</a>
<a id='line_2176'>      the friend of the most eminent scholars of the age: he became</a>
<a id='line_2177'>      their patron; and such was the humility of his manners, that the</a>
<a id='line_2178'>      change was scarcely discernible either to them or to himself. If</a>
<a id='line_2179'>      he pressed the acceptance of a liberal gift, it was not as the</a>

<a id='line_2182'>      a consciousness of his own worth: “ye will not always have a</a>
<a id='line_2183'>      Nicholas among you.” The influence of the holy see pervaded</a>
<a id='line_2184'>      Christendom; and he exerted that influence in the search, not of</a>
<a id='line_2185'>      benefices, but of books. From the ruins of the Byzantine</a>
<a id='line_2186'>      libraries, from the darkest monasteries of Germany and Britain,</a>
<a id='line_2187'>      he collected the dusty manuscripts of the writers of antiquity;</a>
<a id='line_2188'>      and wherever the original could not be removed, a faithful copy</a>
<a id='line_2189'>      was transcribed and transmitted for his use. The Vatican, the old</a>
<a id='line_2190'>      repository for bulls and legends, for superstition and forgery,</a>
<a id='line_2191'>      was daily replenished with more precious furniture; and such was</a>
<a id='line_2192'>      the industry of Nicholas, that in a reign of eight years he</a>
<a id='line_2193'>      formed a library of five thousand volumes. To his munificence the</a>
<a id='line_2194'>      Latin world was indebted for the versions of Xenophon, Diodorus,</a>

<a id='line_2212'>      Janus Lascaris returned from the East with a treasure of two</a>
<a id='line_2213'>      hundred manuscripts, fourscore of which were as yet unknown in</a>
<a id='line_2214'>      the libraries of Europe. 113 The rest of Italy was animated by a</a>
<a id='line_2215'>      similar spirit, and the progress of the nation repaid the</a>
<a id='line_2216'>      liberality of their princes. The Latins held the exclusive</a>
<a id='line_2217'>      property of their own literature; and these disciples of Greece</a>
<a id='line_2218'>      were soon capable of transmitting and improving the lessons which</a>
<a id='line_2219'>      they had imbibed. After a short succession of foreign teachers,</a>
<a id='line_2220'>      the tide of emigration subsided; but the language of</a>
<a id='line_2221'>      Constantinople was spread beyond the Alps and the natives of</a>
<a id='line_2222'>      France, Germany, and England, 114 imparted to their country the</a>
<a id='line_2223'>      sacred fire which they had kindled in the schools of Florence and</a>
<a id='line_2224'>      Rome. 115 In the productions of the mind, as in those of the</a>
<a id='line_2225'>      soil, the gifts of nature are excelled by industry and skill: the</a>
<a id='line_2226'>      Greek authors, forgotten on the banks of the Ilissus, have been</a>

<a id='line_2230'>      Stephens, the erudition of Scaliger, the discernment of Reiske,</a>

<a id='line_2232'>      printing was a casual advantage: but this useful art has been</a>
<a id='line_2233'>      applied by Aldus, and his innumerable successors, to perpetuate</a>
