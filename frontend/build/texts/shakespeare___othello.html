<a id='line_60'>SCENE I. Venice. A street.</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'> Enter Roderigo and Iago.</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>RODERIGO.</a>
<a id='line_65'>Tush, never tell me, I take it much unkindly</a>
<a id='line_66'>That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse,</a>
<a id='line_67'>As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_70'>’Sblood, but you will not hear me.</a>
<a id='line_71'>If ever I did dream of such a matter,</a>
<a id='line_72'>Abhor me.</a>
<a id='line_73'></a>
<a id='line_74'>RODERIGO.</a>
<a id='line_75'>Thou told’st me, thou didst hold him in thy hate.</a>
<a id='line_76'></a>
<a id='line_77'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_78'>Despise me if I do not. Three great ones of the city,</a>
<a id='line_79'>In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,</a>
<a id='line_80'>Off-capp’d to him; and by the faith of man,</a>
<a id='line_81'>I know my price, I am worth no worse a place.</a>
<a id='line_82'>But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,</a>
<a id='line_83'>Evades them, with a bombast circumstance,</a>
<a id='line_84'>Horribly stuff’d with epithets of war:</a>
<a id='line_85'>And in conclusion,</a>
<a id='line_86'>Nonsuits my mediators: for “Certes,” says he,</a>
<a id='line_87'>“I have already chose my officer.”</a>
<a id='line_88'>And what was he?</a>
<a id='line_89'>Forsooth, a great arithmetician,</a>
<a id='line_90'>One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,</a>
<a id='line_91'>A fellow almost damn’d in a fair wife,</a>
<a id='line_92'>That never set a squadron in the field,</a>
<a id='line_93'>Nor the division of a battle knows</a>
<a id='line_94'>More than a spinster, unless the bookish theoric,</a>
<a id='line_95'>Wherein the toged consuls can propose</a>
<a id='line_96'>As masterly as he: mere prattle without practice</a>
<a id='line_97'>Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election,</a>
<a id='line_98'>And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof</a>
<a id='line_99'>At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds,</a>
<a id='line_100'>Christian and heathen, must be belee’d and calm’d</a>
<a id='line_101'>By debitor and creditor, this counter-caster,</a>
<a id='line_102'>He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,</a>
<a id='line_103'>And I, God bless the mark, his Moorship’s ancient.</a>
<a id='line_104'></a>
<a id='line_105'>RODERIGO.</a>
<a id='line_106'>By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_109'>Why, there’s no remedy. ’Tis the curse of service,</a>
<a id='line_110'>Preferment goes by letter and affection,</a>
<a id='line_111'>And not by old gradation, where each second</a>
<a id='line_112'>Stood heir to the first. Now sir, be judge yourself</a>
<a id='line_113'>Whether I in any just term am affin’d</a>
<a id='line_114'>To love the Moor.</a>
<a id='line_115'></a>
<a id='line_116'>RODERIGO.</a>
<a id='line_117'>I would not follow him, then.</a>
<a id='line_118'></a>
<a id='line_119'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_120'>O, sir, content you.</a>
<a id='line_121'>I follow him to serve my turn upon him:</a>
<a id='line_122'>We cannot all be masters, nor all masters</a>
<a id='line_123'>Cannot be truly follow’d. You shall mark</a>
<a id='line_124'>Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave</a>
<a id='line_125'>That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,</a>
<a id='line_126'>Wears out his time, much like his master’s ass,</a>
<a id='line_127'>For nought but provender, and when he’s old, cashier’d.</a>
<a id='line_128'>Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are</a>
<a id='line_129'>Who, trimm’d in forms, and visages of duty,</a>
<a id='line_130'>Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,</a>
<a id='line_131'>And throwing but shows of service on their lords,</a>
<a id='line_132'>Do well thrive by them, and when they have lin’d their coats,</a>
<a id='line_133'>Do themselves homage. These fellows have some soul,</a>
<a id='line_134'>And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,</a>
<a id='line_135'>It is as sure as you are Roderigo,</a>
<a id='line_136'>Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:</a>
<a id='line_137'>In following him, I follow but myself.</a>
<a id='line_138'>Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,</a>
<a id='line_139'>But seeming so for my peculiar end.</a>
<a id='line_140'>For when my outward action doth demonstrate</a>
<a id='line_141'>The native act and figure of my heart</a>
<a id='line_142'>In complement extern, ’tis not long after</a>
<a id='line_143'>But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve</a>
<a id='line_144'>For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.</a>
<a id='line_145'></a>
<a id='line_146'>RODERIGO.</a>
<a id='line_147'>What a full fortune does the thick-lips owe,</a>
<a id='line_148'>If he can carry’t thus!</a>
<a id='line_149'></a>
<a id='line_150'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_151'>Call up her father,</a>
<a id='line_152'>Rouse him, make after him, poison his delight,</a>
<a id='line_153'>Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,</a>
<a id='line_154'>And though he in a fertile climate dwell,</a>
<a id='line_155'>Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,</a>
<a id='line_156'>Yet throw such changes of vexation on’t,</a>
<a id='line_157'>As it may lose some color.</a>
<a id='line_158'></a>
<a id='line_159'>RODERIGO.</a>
<a id='line_160'>Here is her father’s house, I’ll call aloud.</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_163'>Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell</a>
<a id='line_164'>As when, by night and negligence, the fire</a>
<a id='line_165'>Is spied in populous cities.</a>
<a id='line_166'></a>
<a id='line_167'>RODERIGO.</a>
<a id='line_168'>What ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_171'>Awake! what ho, Brabantio! Thieves, thieves!</a>
<a id='line_172'>Look to your house, your daughter, and your bags!</a>
<a id='line_173'>Thieves, thieves!</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>

<a id='line_179'>What is the matter there?</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>RODERIGO.</a>
<a id='line_182'>Signior, is all your family within?</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>

<a id='line_188'>Why, wherefore ask you this?</a>
<a id='line_189'></a>
<a id='line_190'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_191'>Zounds, sir, you’re robb’d, for shame put on your gown,</a>
<a id='line_192'>Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;</a>
<a id='line_193'>Even now, now, very now, an old black ram</a>
<a id='line_194'>Is tupping your white ewe. Arise, arise,</a>
<a id='line_195'>Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,</a>
<a id='line_196'>Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:</a>
<a id='line_197'>Arise, I say.</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>BRABANTIO.</a>
<a id='line_200'>What, have you lost your wits?</a>
<a id='line_201'></a>
<a id='line_202'>RODERIGO.</a>
<a id='line_203'>Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?</a>
<a id='line_204'></a>
<a id='line_205'>BRABANTIO.</a>
<a id='line_206'>Not I. What are you?</a>
<a id='line_207'></a>
<a id='line_208'>RODERIGO.</a>
<a id='line_209'>My name is Roderigo.</a>
<a id='line_210'></a>
<a id='line_211'>BRABANTIO.</a>
<a id='line_212'>The worser welcome.</a>
<a id='line_213'>I have charg’d thee not to haunt about my doors;</a>
<a id='line_214'>In honest plainness thou hast heard me say</a>
<a id='line_215'>My daughter is not for thee; and now in madness,</a>
<a id='line_216'>Being full of supper and distempering draughts,</a>
<a id='line_217'>Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come</a>
<a id='line_218'>To start my quiet.</a>
<a id='line_219'></a>

<a id='line_222'></a>
<a id='line_223'>BRABANTIO.</a>
<a id='line_224'>But thou must needs be sure</a>
<a id='line_225'>My spirit and my place have in them power</a>
<a id='line_226'>To make this bitter to thee.</a>

<a id='line_228'>RODERIGO.</a>
<a id='line_229'>Patience, good sir.</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>BRABANTIO.</a>
<a id='line_232'>What tell’st thou me of robbing?</a>
<a id='line_233'>This is Venice. My house is not a grange.</a>
<a id='line_234'></a>
<a id='line_235'>RODERIGO.</a>
<a id='line_236'>Most grave Brabantio,</a>
<a id='line_237'>In simple and pure soul I come to you.</a>
<a id='line_238'></a>
<a id='line_239'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_240'>Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not serve God if the devil</a>
<a id='line_241'>bid you. Because we come to do you service, and you think we are</a>
<a id='line_242'>ruffians, you’ll have your daughter cover’d with a Barbary horse;</a>
<a id='line_243'>you’ll have your nephews neigh to you; you’ll have coursers for cousins</a>
<a id='line_244'>and gennets for germans.</a>
<a id='line_245'></a>
<a id='line_246'>BRABANTIO.</a>
<a id='line_247'>What profane wretch art thou?</a>
<a id='line_248'></a>
<a id='line_249'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_250'>I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter and the Moor are</a>
<a id='line_251'>now making the beast with two backs.</a>
<a id='line_252'></a>
<a id='line_253'>BRABANTIO.</a>
<a id='line_254'>Thou art a villain.</a>
<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_257'>You are a senator.</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>BRABANTIO.</a>
<a id='line_260'>This thou shalt answer. I know thee, Roderigo.</a>
<a id='line_261'></a>
<a id='line_262'>RODERIGO.</a>
<a id='line_263'>Sir, I will answer anything. But I beseech you,</a>
<a id='line_264'>If ’t be your pleasure, and most wise consent,</a>
<a id='line_265'>(As partly I find it is) that your fair daughter,</a>
<a id='line_266'>At this odd-even and dull watch o’ the night,</a>
<a id='line_267'>Transported with no worse nor better guard,</a>
<a id='line_268'>But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,</a>
<a id='line_269'>To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor:</a>
<a id='line_270'>If this be known to you, and your allowance,</a>
<a id='line_271'>We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs.</a>
<a id='line_272'>But if you know not this, my manners tell me,</a>
<a id='line_273'>We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe</a>
<a id='line_274'>That from the sense of all civility,</a>
<a id='line_275'>I thus would play and trifle with your reverence.</a>
<a id='line_276'>Your daughter (if you have not given her leave)</a>
<a id='line_277'>I say again, hath made a gross revolt,</a>
<a id='line_278'>Tying her duty, beauty, wit, and fortunes</a>
<a id='line_279'>In an extravagant and wheeling stranger</a>
<a id='line_280'>Of here and everywhere. Straight satisfy yourself:</a>
<a id='line_281'>If she be in her chamber or your house,</a>
<a id='line_282'>Let loose on me the justice of the state</a>
<a id='line_283'>For thus deluding you.</a>
<a id='line_284'></a>
<a id='line_285'>BRABANTIO.</a>
<a id='line_286'>Strike on the tinder, ho!</a>
<a id='line_287'>Give me a taper! Call up all my people!</a>
<a id='line_288'>This accident is not unlike my dream,</a>
<a id='line_289'>Belief of it oppresses me already.</a>
<a id='line_290'>Light, I say, light!</a>
<a id='line_291'></a>
<a id='line_292'> [_Exit from above._]</a>
<a id='line_293'></a>
<a id='line_294'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_295'>Farewell; for I must leave you:</a>
<a id='line_296'>It seems not meet nor wholesome to my place</a>
<a id='line_297'>To be produc’d, as if I stay I shall,</a>
<a id='line_298'>Against the Moor. For I do know the state,</a>
<a id='line_299'>However this may gall him with some check,</a>
<a id='line_300'>Cannot with safety cast him, for he’s embark’d</a>
<a id='line_301'>With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,</a>
<a id='line_302'>Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,</a>
<a id='line_303'>Another of his fathom they have none</a>
<a id='line_304'>To lead their business. In which regard,</a>
<a id='line_305'>Though I do hate him as I do hell pains,</a>
<a id='line_306'>Yet, for necessity of present life,</a>
<a id='line_307'>I must show out a flag and sign of love,</a>
<a id='line_308'>Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,</a>
<a id='line_309'>Lead to the Sagittary the raised search,</a>
<a id='line_310'>And there will I be with him. So, farewell.</a>

<a id='line_715'>The very head and front of my offending</a>

<a id='line_774'> [_Exeunt Iago and Attendants._]</a>
<a id='line_775'></a>
<a id='line_776'>And till she come, as truly as to heaven</a>
<a id='line_777'>I do confess the vices of my blood,</a>
<a id='line_778'>So justly to your grave ears I’ll present</a>
<a id='line_779'>How I did thrive in this fair lady’s love,</a>
<a id='line_780'>And she in mine.</a>
<a id='line_781'></a>
<a id='line_782'>DUKE.</a>
<a id='line_783'>Say it, Othello.</a>
<a id='line_784'></a>
<a id='line_785'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_786'>Her father lov’d me, oft invited me,</a>
<a id='line_787'>Still question’d me the story of my life,</a>
<a id='line_788'>From year to year—the battles, sieges, fortunes,</a>
<a id='line_789'>That I have pass’d.</a>
<a id='line_790'>I ran it through, even from my boyish days</a>
<a id='line_791'>To the very moment that he bade me tell it,</a>
<a id='line_792'>Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,</a>
<a id='line_793'>Of moving accidents by flood and field;</a>
<a id='line_794'>Of hair-breadth scapes i’ th’ imminent deadly breach;</a>
<a id='line_795'>Of being taken by the insolent foe,</a>
<a id='line_796'>And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence,</a>
<a id='line_797'>And portance in my traveler’s history,</a>
<a id='line_798'>Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,</a>
<a id='line_799'>Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch heaven,</a>
<a id='line_800'>It was my hint to speak,—such was the process;</a>
<a id='line_801'>And of the Cannibals that each other eat,</a>
<a id='line_802'>The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads</a>
<a id='line_803'>Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear</a>
<a id='line_804'>Would Desdemona seriously incline.</a>
<a id='line_805'>But still the house affairs would draw her thence,</a>
<a id='line_806'>Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,</a>
<a id='line_807'>She’d come again, and with a greedy ear</a>
<a id='line_808'>Devour up my discourse; which I observing,</a>
<a id='line_809'>Took once a pliant hour, and found good means</a>
<a id='line_810'>To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart</a>
<a id='line_811'>That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,</a>
<a id='line_812'>Whereof by parcels she had something heard,</a>
<a id='line_813'>But not intentively. I did consent,</a>
<a id='line_814'>And often did beguile her of her tears,</a>
<a id='line_815'>When I did speak of some distressful stroke</a>
<a id='line_816'>That my youth suffer’d. My story being done,</a>
<a id='line_817'>She gave me for my pains a world of sighs.</a>
<a id='line_818'>She swore, in faith, ’twas strange, ’twas passing strange;</a>
<a id='line_819'>’Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful.</a>
<a id='line_820'>She wish’d she had not heard it, yet she wish’d</a>
<a id='line_821'>That heaven had made her such a man: she thank’d me,</a>
<a id='line_822'>And bade me, if I had a friend that lov’d her,</a>
<a id='line_823'>I should but teach him how to tell my story,</a>
<a id='line_824'>And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:</a>
<a id='line_825'>She lov’d me for the dangers I had pass’d,</a>
<a id='line_826'>And I lov’d her that she did pity them.</a>
<a id='line_827'>This only is the witchcraft I have us’d.</a>
<a id='line_828'>Here comes the lady. Let her witness it.</a>

<a id='line_871'>DUKE.</a>
<a id='line_872'>Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,</a>
<a id='line_873'>Which as a grise or step may help these lovers</a>

<a id='line_876'>By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.</a>
<a id='line_877'>To mourn a mischief that is past and gone</a>

<a id='line_891'>These sentences to sugar or to gall,</a>

<a id='line_1051'>What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not</a>

<a id='line_1053'></a>
<a id='line_1054'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_1055'>Virtue! a fig! ’Tis in ourselves that we are thus or thus. Our bodies</a>

<a id='line_1058'>with one gender of herbs or distract it with many, either to have it</a>
<a id='line_1059'>sterile with idleness or manured with industry, why, the power and</a>

<a id='line_1073'>thy friend, and I confess me knit to thy deserving with cables of</a>
<a id='line_1074'>perdurable toughness; I could never better stead thee than now. Put</a>
<a id='line_1075'>money in thy purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with an</a>

<a id='line_1077'>Desdemona should long continue her love to the Moor,—put money in thy</a>
<a id='line_1078'>purse,—nor he his to her. It was a violent commencement, and thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_1079'>see an answerable sequestration—put but money in thy purse. These Moors</a>
<a id='line_1080'>are changeable in their wills. Fill thy purse with money. The food that</a>
<a id='line_1081'>to him now is as luscious as locusts shall be to him shortly as acerb</a>
<a id='line_1082'>as the coloquintida. She must change for youth. When she is sated with</a>
<a id='line_1083'>his body, she will find the error of her choice. She must have change,</a>
<a id='line_1084'>she must. Therefore put money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damn</a>
<a id='line_1085'>thyself, do it a more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money</a>
<a id='line_1086'>thou canst. If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian</a>
<a id='line_1087'>and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits and all the</a>
<a id='line_1088'>tribe of hell, thou shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of</a>
<a id='line_1089'>drowning thyself! It is clean out of the way: seek thou rather to be</a>
<a id='line_1090'>hanged in compassing thy joy than to be drowned and go without her.</a>

<a id='line_1138'>To get his place, and to plume up my will</a>

<a id='line_1195'>The desperate tempest hath so bang’d the Turks</a>

<a id='line_1573'>Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. Mark me with what</a>
<a id='line_1574'>violence she first loved the Moor, but for bragging, and telling her</a>
<a id='line_1575'>fantastical lies. And will she love him still for prating? Let not thy</a>
<a id='line_1576'>discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed. And what delight shall</a>
<a id='line_1577'>she have to look on the devil? When the blood is made dull with the act</a>
<a id='line_1578'>of sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to give satiety a</a>
<a id='line_1579'>fresh appetite, loveliness in favour, sympathy in years, manners, and</a>
<a id='line_1580'>beauties; all which the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these</a>
<a id='line_1581'>required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will find itself abused,</a>
<a id='line_1582'>begin to heave the gorge, disrelish and abhor the Moor, very nature</a>
<a id='line_1583'>will instruct her in it, and compel her to some second choice. Now sir,</a>
<a id='line_1584'>this granted (as it is a most pregnant and unforced position) who</a>
<a id='line_1585'>stands so eminently in the degree of this fortune as Cassio does? a</a>

<a id='line_1590'>counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never present itself: a</a>
<a id='line_1591'>devilish knave! Besides, the knave is handsome, young, and hath all</a>

<a id='line_2056'>Now, by heaven,</a>
<a id='line_2057'>My blood begins my safer guides to rule,</a>

<a id='line_2060'>Or do but lift this arm, the best of you</a>
<a id='line_2061'>Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know</a>
<a id='line_2062'>How this foul rout began, who set it on,</a>
<a id='line_2063'>And he that is approv’d in this offence,</a>
<a id='line_2064'>Though he had twinn’d with me, both at a birth,</a>
<a id='line_2065'>Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,</a>
<a id='line_2066'>Yet wild, the people’s hearts brimful of fear,</a>
<a id='line_2067'>To manage private and domestic quarrel,</a>
<a id='line_2068'>In night, and on the court and guard of safety?</a>
<a id='line_2069'>’Tis monstrous. Iago, who began’t?</a>

<a id='line_2076'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2077'>Touch me not so near.</a>
<a id='line_2078'>I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth</a>
<a id='line_2079'>Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio.</a>
<a id='line_2080'>Yet I persuade myself, to speak the truth</a>
<a id='line_2081'>Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general:</a>
<a id='line_2082'>Montano and myself being in speech,</a>
<a id='line_2083'>There comes a fellow crying out for help,</a>
<a id='line_2084'>And Cassio following him with determin’d sword,</a>
<a id='line_2085'>To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman</a>
<a id='line_2086'>Steps in to Cassio and entreats his pause.</a>
<a id='line_2087'>Myself the crying fellow did pursue,</a>
<a id='line_2088'>Lest by his clamour (as it so fell out)</a>
<a id='line_2089'>The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,</a>
<a id='line_2090'>Outran my purpose: and I return’d the rather</a>
<a id='line_2091'>For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,</a>
<a id='line_2092'>And Cassio high in oath, which till tonight</a>
<a id='line_2093'>I ne’er might say before. When I came back,</a>
<a id='line_2094'>(For this was brief) I found them close together,</a>
<a id='line_2095'>At blow and thrust, even as again they were</a>
<a id='line_2096'>When you yourself did part them.</a>
<a id='line_2097'>More of this matter cannot I report.</a>
<a id='line_2098'>But men are men; the best sometimes forget;</a>
<a id='line_2099'>Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,</a>
<a id='line_2100'>As men in rage strike those that wish them best,</a>
<a id='line_2101'>Yet surely Cassio, I believe, receiv’d</a>
<a id='line_2102'>From him that fled some strange indignity,</a>
<a id='line_2103'>Which patience could not pass.</a>
<a id='line_2104'></a>
<a id='line_2105'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2106'>I know, Iago,</a>
<a id='line_2107'>Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,</a>

<a id='line_2603'>To incur a private check. When shall he come?</a>
<a id='line_2604'>Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,</a>
<a id='line_2605'>What you would ask me, that I should deny,</a>
<a id='line_2606'>Or stand so mammering on. What? Michael Cassio,</a>
<a id='line_2607'>That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,</a>
<a id='line_2608'>When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,</a>
<a id='line_2609'>Hath ta’en your part, to have so much to do</a>
<a id='line_2610'>To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much.</a>
<a id='line_2611'></a>
<a id='line_2612'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2613'>Prithee no more. Let him come when he will;</a>
<a id='line_2614'>I will deny thee nothing.</a>
<a id='line_2615'></a>
<a id='line_2616'>DESDEMONA.</a>
<a id='line_2617'>Why, this is not a boon;</a>
<a id='line_2618'>’Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,</a>
<a id='line_2619'>Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,</a>
<a id='line_2620'>Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit</a>
<a id='line_2621'>To your own person: nay, when I have a suit</a>
<a id='line_2622'>Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,</a>
<a id='line_2623'>It shall be full of poise and difficult weight,</a>
<a id='line_2624'>And fearful to be granted.</a>
<a id='line_2625'></a>
<a id='line_2626'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2627'>I will deny thee nothing.</a>
<a id='line_2628'>Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,</a>
<a id='line_2629'>To leave me but a little to myself.</a>
<a id='line_2630'></a>
<a id='line_2631'>DESDEMONA.</a>
<a id='line_2632'>Shall I deny you? No, farewell, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_2633'></a>
<a id='line_2634'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2635'>Farewell, my Desdemona. I’ll come to thee straight.</a>
<a id='line_2636'></a>
<a id='line_2637'>DESDEMONA.</a>
<a id='line_2638'>Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you.</a>
<a id='line_2639'>Whate’er you be, I am obedient.</a>

<a id='line_2644'>Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,</a>
<a id='line_2645'>But I do love thee! And when I love thee not,</a>
<a id='line_2646'>Chaos is come again.</a>
<a id='line_2647'></a>
<a id='line_2648'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2649'>My noble lord,—</a>
<a id='line_2650'></a>
<a id='line_2651'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2652'>What dost thou say, Iago?</a>
<a id='line_2653'></a>
<a id='line_2654'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2655'>Did Michael Cassio, when you woo’d my lady,</a>
<a id='line_2656'>Know of your love?</a>
<a id='line_2657'></a>
<a id='line_2658'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2659'>He did, from first to last. Why dost thou ask?</a>
<a id='line_2660'></a>
<a id='line_2661'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2662'>But for a satisfaction of my thought.</a>
<a id='line_2663'>No further harm.</a>
<a id='line_2664'></a>
<a id='line_2665'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2666'>Why of thy thought, Iago?</a>
<a id='line_2667'></a>
<a id='line_2668'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2669'>I did not think he had been acquainted with her.</a>
<a id='line_2670'></a>
<a id='line_2671'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2672'>O yes, and went between us very oft.</a>
<a id='line_2673'></a>
<a id='line_2674'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2675'>Indeed?</a>
<a id='line_2676'></a>
<a id='line_2677'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2678'>Indeed? Ay, indeed. Discern’st thou aught in that?</a>
<a id='line_2679'>Is he not honest?</a>
<a id='line_2680'></a>
<a id='line_2681'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2682'>Honest, my lord?</a>
<a id='line_2683'></a>
<a id='line_2684'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2685'>Honest? ay, honest.</a>
<a id='line_2686'></a>
<a id='line_2687'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2688'>My lord, for aught I know.</a>
<a id='line_2689'></a>
<a id='line_2690'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2691'>What dost thou think?</a>
<a id='line_2692'></a>
<a id='line_2693'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2694'>Think, my lord?</a>
<a id='line_2695'></a>
<a id='line_2696'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2697'>Think, my lord? By heaven, he echoes me,</a>
<a id='line_2698'>As if there were some monster in his thought</a>
<a id='line_2699'>Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something.</a>
<a id='line_2700'>I heard thee say even now, thou lik’st not that,</a>
<a id='line_2701'>When Cassio left my wife. What didst not like?</a>
<a id='line_2702'>And when I told thee he was of my counsel</a>
<a id='line_2703'>In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst, “Indeed?”</a>
<a id='line_2704'>And didst contract and purse thy brow together,</a>
<a id='line_2705'>As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain</a>
<a id='line_2706'>Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,</a>
<a id='line_2707'>Show me thy thought.</a>
<a id='line_2708'></a>
<a id='line_2709'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2710'>My lord, you know I love you.</a>
<a id='line_2711'></a>
<a id='line_2712'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2713'>I think thou dost;</a>
<a id='line_2714'>And for I know thou’rt full of love and honesty</a>
<a id='line_2715'>And weigh’st thy words before thou giv’st them breath,</a>
<a id='line_2716'>Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:</a>
<a id='line_2717'>For such things in a false disloyal knave</a>
<a id='line_2718'>Are tricks of custom; but in a man that’s just,</a>
<a id='line_2719'>They’re close dilations, working from the heart,</a>
<a id='line_2720'>That passion cannot rule.</a>
<a id='line_2721'></a>
<a id='line_2722'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2723'>For Michael Cassio,</a>
<a id='line_2724'>I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.</a>
<a id='line_2725'></a>
<a id='line_2726'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2727'>I think so too.</a>
<a id='line_2728'></a>
<a id='line_2729'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2730'>Men should be what they seem;</a>
<a id='line_2731'>Or those that be not, would they might seem none!</a>
<a id='line_2732'></a>
<a id='line_2733'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2734'>Certain, men should be what they seem.</a>
<a id='line_2735'></a>
<a id='line_2736'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2737'>Why then, I think Cassio’s an honest man.</a>
<a id='line_2738'></a>
<a id='line_2739'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2740'>Nay, yet there’s more in this:</a>
<a id='line_2741'>I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,</a>
<a id='line_2742'>As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts</a>
<a id='line_2743'>The worst of words.</a>
<a id='line_2744'></a>
<a id='line_2745'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2746'>Good my lord, pardon me.</a>
<a id='line_2747'>Though I am bound to every act of duty,</a>
<a id='line_2748'>I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.</a>
<a id='line_2749'>Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false:</a>
<a id='line_2750'>As where’s that palace whereinto foul things</a>
<a id='line_2751'>Sometimes intrude not? Who has a breast so pure</a>
<a id='line_2752'>But some uncleanly apprehensions</a>
<a id='line_2753'>Keep leets and law-days, and in session sit</a>
<a id='line_2754'>With meditations lawful?</a>
<a id='line_2755'></a>
<a id='line_2756'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2757'>Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,</a>
<a id='line_2758'>If thou but think’st him wrong’d and mak’st his ear</a>
<a id='line_2759'>A stranger to thy thoughts.</a>
<a id='line_2760'></a>
<a id='line_2761'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2762'>I do beseech you,</a>
<a id='line_2763'>Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,</a>
<a id='line_2764'>As, I confess, it is my nature’s plague</a>
<a id='line_2765'>To spy into abuses, and of my jealousy</a>
<a id='line_2766'>Shapes faults that are not,—that your wisdom</a>
<a id='line_2767'>From one that so imperfectly conceits,</a>
<a id='line_2768'>Would take no notice; nor build yourself a trouble</a>
<a id='line_2769'>Out of his scattering and unsure observance.</a>
<a id='line_2770'>It were not for your quiet nor your good,</a>
<a id='line_2771'>Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,</a>
<a id='line_2772'>To let you know my thoughts.</a>
<a id='line_2773'></a>
<a id='line_2774'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2775'>What dost thou mean?</a>
<a id='line_2776'></a>
<a id='line_2777'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2778'>Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,</a>
<a id='line_2779'>Is the immediate jewel of their souls.</a>
<a id='line_2780'>Who steals my purse steals trash. ’Tis something, nothing;</a>
<a id='line_2781'>’Twas mine, ’tis his, and has been slave to thousands.</a>
<a id='line_2782'>But he that filches from me my good name</a>
<a id='line_2783'>Robs me of that which not enriches him</a>
<a id='line_2784'>And makes me poor indeed.</a>
<a id='line_2785'></a>
<a id='line_2786'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2787'>By heaven, I’ll know thy thoughts.</a>
<a id='line_2788'></a>
<a id='line_2789'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2790'>You cannot, if my heart were in your hand,</a>
<a id='line_2791'>Nor shall not, whilst ’tis in my custody.</a>
<a id='line_2792'></a>
<a id='line_2793'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2794'>Ha?</a>
<a id='line_2795'></a>
<a id='line_2796'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2797'>O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;</a>
<a id='line_2798'>It is the green-ey’d monster which doth mock</a>
<a id='line_2799'>The meat it feeds on. That cuckold lives in bliss</a>
<a id='line_2800'>Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;</a>
<a id='line_2801'>But O, what damned minutes tells he o’er</a>
<a id='line_2802'>Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!</a>
<a id='line_2803'></a>
<a id='line_2804'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2805'>O misery!</a>
<a id='line_2806'></a>
<a id='line_2807'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2808'>Poor and content is rich, and rich enough;</a>
<a id='line_2809'>But riches fineless is as poor as winter</a>
<a id='line_2810'>To him that ever fears he shall be poor.</a>
<a id='line_2811'>Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend</a>
<a id='line_2812'>From jealousy!</a>
<a id='line_2813'></a>
<a id='line_2814'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2815'>Why, why is this?</a>
<a id='line_2816'>Think’st thou I’d make a life of jealousy,</a>
<a id='line_2817'>To follow still the changes of the moon</a>
<a id='line_2818'>With fresh suspicions? No. To be once in doubt</a>
<a id='line_2819'>Is once to be resolv’d: exchange me for a goat</a>
<a id='line_2820'>When I shall turn the business of my soul</a>
<a id='line_2821'>To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,</a>
<a id='line_2822'>Matching thy inference. ’Tis not to make me jealous,</a>
<a id='line_2823'>To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,</a>
<a id='line_2824'>Is free of speech, sings, plays, and dances well;</a>
<a id='line_2825'>Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:</a>
<a id='line_2826'>Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw</a>
<a id='line_2827'>The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,</a>
<a id='line_2828'>For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago,</a>
<a id='line_2829'>I’ll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;</a>
<a id='line_2830'>And on the proof, there is no more but this:</a>
<a id='line_2831'>Away at once with love or jealousy!</a>
<a id='line_2832'></a>
<a id='line_2833'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2834'>I am glad of it, for now I shall have reason</a>
<a id='line_2835'>To show the love and duty that I bear you</a>
<a id='line_2836'>With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,</a>
<a id='line_2837'>Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.</a>
<a id='line_2838'>Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;</a>
<a id='line_2839'>Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure.</a>
<a id='line_2840'>I would not have your free and noble nature,</a>
<a id='line_2841'>Out of self-bounty, be abus’d. Look to’t.</a>
<a id='line_2842'>I know our country disposition well;</a>
<a id='line_2843'>In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks</a>
<a id='line_2844'>They dare not show their husbands. Their best conscience</a>
<a id='line_2845'>Is not to leave undone, but keep unknown.</a>
<a id='line_2846'></a>
<a id='line_2847'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2848'>Dost thou say so?</a>
<a id='line_2849'></a>
<a id='line_2850'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2851'>She did deceive her father, marrying you;</a>
<a id='line_2852'>And when she seem’d to shake and fear your looks,</a>
<a id='line_2853'>She loved them most.</a>
<a id='line_2854'></a>
<a id='line_2855'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2856'>And so she did.</a>
<a id='line_2857'></a>
<a id='line_2858'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2859'>Why, go to then.</a>
<a id='line_2860'>She that so young could give out such a seeming,</a>
<a id='line_2861'>To seal her father’s eyes up close as oak,</a>
<a id='line_2862'>He thought ’twas witchcraft. But I am much to blame.</a>
<a id='line_2863'>I humbly do beseech you of your pardon</a>
<a id='line_2864'>For too much loving you.</a>
<a id='line_2865'></a>
<a id='line_2866'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2867'>I am bound to thee for ever.</a>
<a id='line_2868'></a>
<a id='line_2869'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2870'>I see this hath a little dash’d your spirits.</a>
<a id='line_2871'></a>
<a id='line_2872'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2873'>Not a jot, not a jot.</a>
<a id='line_2874'></a>
<a id='line_2875'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2876'>Trust me, I fear it has.</a>
<a id='line_2877'>I hope you will consider what is spoke</a>
<a id='line_2878'>Comes from my love. But I do see you’re mov’d.</a>
<a id='line_2879'>I am to pray you not to strain my speech</a>
<a id='line_2880'>To grosser issues nor to larger reach</a>
<a id='line_2881'>Than to suspicion.</a>
<a id='line_2882'></a>
<a id='line_2883'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2884'>I will not.</a>
<a id='line_2885'></a>
<a id='line_2886'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2887'>Should you do so, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_2888'>My speech should fall into such vile success</a>
<a id='line_2889'>Which my thoughts aim’d not. Cassio’s my worthy friend.</a>
<a id='line_2890'>My lord, I see you’re mov’d.</a>
<a id='line_2891'></a>
<a id='line_2892'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2893'>No, not much mov’d.</a>
<a id='line_2894'>I do not think but Desdemona’s honest.</a>
<a id='line_2895'></a>
<a id='line_2896'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2897'>Long live she so! And long live you to think so!</a>
<a id='line_2898'></a>
<a id='line_2899'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2900'>And yet, how nature erring from itself—</a>
<a id='line_2901'></a>
<a id='line_2902'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_2903'>Ay, there’s the point. As, to be bold with you,</a>
<a id='line_2904'>Not to affect many proposed matches,</a>
<a id='line_2905'>Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,</a>
<a id='line_2906'>Whereto we see in all things nature tends;</a>
<a id='line_2907'>Foh! One may smell in such a will most rank,</a>
<a id='line_2908'>Foul disproportion, thoughts unnatural.</a>
<a id='line_2909'>But pardon me: I do not in position</a>
<a id='line_2910'>Distinctly speak of her, though I may fear</a>
<a id='line_2911'>Her will, recoiling to her better judgement,</a>
<a id='line_2912'>May fall to match you with her country forms,</a>
<a id='line_2913'>And happily repent.</a>
<a id='line_2914'></a>
<a id='line_2915'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2916'>Farewell, farewell:</a>
<a id='line_2917'>If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;</a>
<a id='line_2918'>Set on thy wife to observe. Leave me, Iago.</a>

<a id='line_2934'>Note if your lady strain his entertainment</a>

<a id='line_2936'>Much will be seen in that. In the meantime,</a>

<a id='line_2946'></a>
<a id='line_2947'> [_Exit._]</a>

<a id='line_2949'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_2950'>This fellow’s of exceeding honesty,</a>
<a id='line_2951'>And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,</a>
<a id='line_2952'>Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,</a>
<a id='line_2953'>Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,</a>
<a id='line_2954'>I’d whistle her off, and let her down the wind</a>
<a id='line_2955'>To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black,</a>
<a id='line_2956'>And have not those soft parts of conversation</a>
<a id='line_2957'>That chamberers have, or for I am declin’d</a>
<a id='line_2958'>Into the vale of years,—yet that’s not much—</a>
<a id='line_2959'>She’s gone, I am abus’d, and my relief</a>
<a id='line_2960'>Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,</a>
<a id='line_2961'>That we can call these delicate creatures ours,</a>
<a id='line_2962'>And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,</a>
<a id='line_2963'>And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,</a>

<a id='line_2966'>Prerogativ’d are they less than the base,</a>
<a id='line_2967'>’Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:</a>
<a id='line_2968'>Even then this forked plague is fated to us</a>

<a id='line_3184'>I’ll have some proof: her name, that was as fresh</a>
<a id='line_3185'>As Dian’s visage, is now begrim’d and black</a>
<a id='line_3186'>As mine own face. If there be cords or knives,</a>

<a id='line_3206'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_3207'>It were a tedious difficulty, I think,</a>

<a id='line_3216'>If imputation and strong circumstances,</a>
<a id='line_3217'>Which lead directly to the door of truth,</a>
<a id='line_3218'>Will give you satisfaction, you may have’t.</a>
<a id='line_3219'></a>
<a id='line_3220'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_3221'>Give me a living reason she’s disloyal.</a>

<a id='line_3223'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_3224'>I do not like the office,</a>
<a id='line_3225'>But sith I am enter’d in this cause so far,</a>
<a id='line_3226'>Prick’d to ’t by foolish honesty and love,</a>
<a id='line_3227'>I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately,</a>
<a id='line_3228'>And being troubled with a raging tooth,</a>
<a id='line_3229'>I could not sleep.</a>
<a id='line_3230'>There are a kind of men so loose of soul,</a>
<a id='line_3231'>That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs.</a>
<a id='line_3232'>One of this kind is Cassio:</a>
<a id='line_3233'>In sleep I heard him say, “Sweet Desdemona,</a>
<a id='line_3234'>Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;”</a>
<a id='line_3235'>And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,</a>
<a id='line_3236'>Cry “O sweet creature!” and then kiss me hard,</a>
<a id='line_3237'>As if he pluck’d up kisses by the roots,</a>
<a id='line_3238'>That grew upon my lips, then laid his leg</a>
<a id='line_3239'>Over my thigh, and sigh’d and kiss’d, and then</a>
<a id='line_3240'>Cried “Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!”</a>
<a id='line_3241'></a>
<a id='line_3242'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_3243'>O monstrous! monstrous!</a>
<a id='line_3244'></a>
<a id='line_3245'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_3246'>Nay, this was but his dream.</a>
<a id='line_3247'></a>
<a id='line_3248'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_3249'>But this denoted a foregone conclusion.</a>
<a id='line_3250'>’Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.</a>
<a id='line_3251'></a>
<a id='line_3252'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_3253'>And this may help to thicken other proofs</a>
<a id='line_3254'>That do demonstrate thinly.</a>
<a id='line_3255'></a>
<a id='line_3256'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_3257'>I’ll tear her all to pieces.</a>
<a id='line_3258'></a>
<a id='line_3259'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_3260'>Nay, but be wise. Yet we see nothing done,</a>
<a id='line_3261'>She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,</a>
<a id='line_3262'>Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief</a>
<a id='line_3263'>Spotted with strawberries in your wife’s hand?</a>
<a id='line_3264'></a>
<a id='line_3265'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_3266'>I gave her such a one, ’twas my first gift.</a>
<a id='line_3267'></a>
<a id='line_3268'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_3269'>I know not that: but such a handkerchief</a>
<a id='line_3270'>(I am sure it was your wife’s) did I today</a>
<a id='line_3271'>See Cassio wipe his beard with.</a>
<a id='line_3272'></a>
<a id='line_3273'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_3274'>If it be that,—</a>
<a id='line_3275'></a>
<a id='line_3276'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_3277'>If it be that, or any that was hers,</a>
<a id='line_3278'>It speaks against her with the other proofs.</a>
<a id='line_3279'></a>
<a id='line_3280'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_3281'>O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!</a>
<a id='line_3282'>One is too poor, too weak for my revenge!</a>
<a id='line_3283'>Now do I see ’tis true. Look here, Iago;</a>
<a id='line_3284'>All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.</a>
<a id='line_3285'>’Tis gone.</a>

<a id='line_3296'></a>
<a id='line_3297'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_3298'>Patience, I say. Your mind perhaps may change.</a>
<a id='line_3299'></a>
<a id='line_3300'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_3301'>Never, Iago. Like to the Pontic Sea,</a>

<a id='line_4879'>a harlotry, and thither will I go to him. He knows not yet of his</a>
<a id='line_4880'>honourable fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which I will</a>
<a id='line_4881'>fashion to fall out between twelve and one, you may take him at your</a>
<a id='line_4882'>pleasure: I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall</a>

<a id='line_4884'>show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself</a>

<a id='line_6075'>Than twenty times your stop. But, O vain boast!</a>
<a id='line_6076'>Who can control his fate? ’Tis not so now.</a>
<a id='line_6077'>Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon’d.</a>
<a id='line_6078'>Here is my journey’s end, here is my butt,</a>
<a id='line_6079'>And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.</a>
<a id='line_6080'>Do you go back dismay’d? ’Tis a lost fear.</a>
<a id='line_6081'>Man but a rush against Othello’s breast,</a>
<a id='line_6082'>And he retires. Where should Othello go?</a>
<a id='line_6083'>Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr’d wench,</a>
<a id='line_6084'>Pale as thy smock, when we shall meet at compt,</a>
<a id='line_6085'>This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,</a>
<a id='line_6086'>And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!</a>
<a id='line_6087'>Even like thy chastity.</a>
<a id='line_6088'>O cursed, cursed slave! Whip me, ye devils,</a>
<a id='line_6089'>From the possession of this heavenly sight!</a>
<a id='line_6090'>Blow me about in winds, roast me in sulphur,</a>
<a id='line_6091'>Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!</a>
<a id='line_6092'>O Desdemon! Dead, Desdemon! dead! Oh, oh!</a>
<a id='line_6093'></a>
<a id='line_6094'> Enter Lodovico, Montano, Cassio carried in a chair, and Officers with</a>

<a id='line_6098'>Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?</a>
<a id='line_6099'></a>
<a id='line_6100'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_6101'>That’s he that was Othello. Here I am.</a>

<a id='line_6105'></a>
<a id='line_6106'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_6107'>I look down towards his feet; but that’s a fable.</a>

<a id='line_6116'>I bleed, sir, but not kill’d.</a>
<a id='line_6117'></a>
<a id='line_6118'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_6119'>I am not sorry neither. I’d have thee live,</a>
<a id='line_6120'>For in my sense ’tis happiness to die.</a>
<a id='line_6121'></a>
<a id='line_6122'>LODOVICO.</a>
<a id='line_6123'>O thou Othello, that wert once so good,</a>
<a id='line_6124'>Fall’n in the practice of a damned slave,</a>
<a id='line_6125'>What shall be said to thee?</a>
<a id='line_6126'></a>
<a id='line_6127'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_6128'>Why, anything;</a>
<a id='line_6129'>An honourable murderer, if you will.</a>
<a id='line_6130'>For naught did I in hate, but all in honour.</a>
<a id='line_6131'></a>
<a id='line_6132'>LODOVICO.</a>
<a id='line_6133'>This wretch hath part confess’d his villany.</a>
<a id='line_6134'>Did you and he consent in Cassio’s death?</a>
<a id='line_6135'></a>
<a id='line_6136'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_6137'>Ay.</a>
<a id='line_6138'></a>
<a id='line_6139'>CASSIO.</a>
<a id='line_6140'>Dear general, I never gave you cause.</a>
<a id='line_6141'></a>
<a id='line_6142'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_6143'>I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.</a>
<a id='line_6144'>Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil</a>
<a id='line_6145'>Why he hath thus ensnar’d my soul and body?</a>
<a id='line_6146'></a>
<a id='line_6147'>IAGO.</a>
<a id='line_6148'>Demand me nothing. What you know, you know.</a>
<a id='line_6149'>From this time forth I never will speak word.</a>
<a id='line_6150'></a>
<a id='line_6151'>LODOVICO.</a>
<a id='line_6152'>What, not to pray?</a>
<a id='line_6153'></a>
<a id='line_6154'>GRATIANO.</a>
<a id='line_6155'>Torments will ope your lips.</a>
<a id='line_6156'></a>
<a id='line_6157'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_6158'>Well, thou dost best.</a>
<a id='line_6159'></a>
<a id='line_6160'>LODOVICO.</a>
<a id='line_6161'>Sir, you shall understand what hath befall’n,</a>
<a id='line_6162'>Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter</a>
<a id='line_6163'>Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo,</a>
<a id='line_6164'>And here another. The one of them imports</a>
<a id='line_6165'>The death of Cassio, to be undertook</a>
<a id='line_6166'>By Roderigo.</a>
<a id='line_6167'></a>
<a id='line_6168'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_6169'>O villain!</a>
<a id='line_6170'></a>
<a id='line_6171'>CASSIO.</a>
<a id='line_6172'>Most heathenish and most gross!</a>
<a id='line_6173'></a>
<a id='line_6174'>LODOVICO.</a>
<a id='line_6175'>Now here’s another discontented paper,</a>
<a id='line_6176'>Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,</a>
<a id='line_6177'>Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain,</a>
<a id='line_6178'>But that, belike, Iago in the interim</a>
<a id='line_6179'>Came in and satisfied him.</a>
<a id='line_6180'></a>
<a id='line_6181'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_6182'>O the pernicious caitiff!</a>
<a id='line_6183'>How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief</a>
<a id='line_6184'>That was my wife’s?</a>
<a id='line_6185'></a>
<a id='line_6186'>CASSIO.</a>
<a id='line_6187'>I found it in my chamber.</a>
<a id='line_6188'>And he himself confess’d but even now,</a>
<a id='line_6189'>That there he dropp’d it for a special purpose</a>
<a id='line_6190'>Which wrought to his desire.</a>
<a id='line_6191'></a>
<a id='line_6192'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_6193'>O fool! fool! fool!</a>
<a id='line_6194'></a>
<a id='line_6195'>CASSIO.</a>
<a id='line_6196'>There is besides in Roderigo’s letter,</a>
<a id='line_6197'>How he upbraids Iago, that he made him</a>
<a id='line_6198'>Brave me upon the watch, whereon it came</a>
<a id='line_6199'>That I was cast. And even but now he spake,</a>
<a id='line_6200'>After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,</a>
<a id='line_6201'>Iago set him on.</a>
<a id='line_6202'></a>
<a id='line_6203'>LODOVICO.</a>
<a id='line_6204'>You must forsake this room, and go with us.</a>
<a id='line_6205'>Your power and your command is taken off,</a>
<a id='line_6206'>And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,</a>
<a id='line_6207'>If there be any cunning cruelty</a>
<a id='line_6208'>That can torment him much and hold him long,</a>
<a id='line_6209'>It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,</a>
<a id='line_6210'>Till that the nature of your fault be known</a>
<a id='line_6211'>To the Venetian state. Come, bring away.</a>
<a id='line_6212'></a>
<a id='line_6213'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_6214'>Soft you; a word or two before you go.</a>
<a id='line_6215'>I have done the state some service, and they know’t.</a>
<a id='line_6216'>No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,</a>
<a id='line_6217'>When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,</a>
<a id='line_6218'>Speak of me as I am. Nothing extenuate,</a>
<a id='line_6219'>Nor set down aught in malice. Then must you speak</a>
<a id='line_6220'>Of one that loved not wisely, but too well;</a>
<a id='line_6221'>Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought,</a>
<a id='line_6222'>Perplex’d in the extreme; of one whose hand,</a>
<a id='line_6223'>Like the base Judean, threw a pearl away</a>
<a id='line_6224'>Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdu’d eyes,</a>
<a id='line_6225'>Albeit unused to the melting mood,</a>
<a id='line_6226'>Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees</a>
<a id='line_6227'>Their medicinal gum. Set you down this.</a>
<a id='line_6228'>And say besides, that in Aleppo once,</a>
<a id='line_6229'>Where a malignant and a turban’d Turk</a>
<a id='line_6230'>Beat a Venetian and traduc’d the state,</a>
<a id='line_6231'>I took by the throat the circumcised dog,</a>
<a id='line_6232'>And smote him, thus.</a>
<a id='line_6233'></a>
<a id='line_6234'> [_Stabs himself._]</a>

<a id='line_6238'></a>
<a id='line_6239'>GRATIANO.</a>
<a id='line_6240'>All that’s spoke is marr’d.</a>
<a id='line_6241'></a>
<a id='line_6242'>OTHELLO.</a>
<a id='line_6243'>I kiss’d thee ere I kill’d thee. No way but this,</a>
<a id='line_6244'>Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.</a>
<a id='line_6245'></a>
<a id='line_6246'> [_Falling upon Desdemona._]</a>
<a id='line_6247'></a>
<a id='line_6248'>CASSIO.</a>
<a id='line_6249'>This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon,</a>
<a id='line_6250'>For he was great of heart.</a>
<a id='line_6251'></a>
<a id='line_6252'>LODOVICO.</a>
<a id='line_6253'>[_To Iago._] O Spartan dog,</a>
<a id='line_6254'>More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea,</a>
<a id='line_6255'>Look on the tragic loading of this bed.</a>
<a id='line_6256'>This is thy work. The object poisons sight,</a>
<a id='line_6257'>Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,</a>
<a id='line_6258'>And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,</a>
<a id='line_6259'>For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,</a>
<a id='line_6260'>Remains the censure of this hellish villain.</a>
<a id='line_6261'>The time, the place, the torture, O, enforce it!</a>
<a id='line_6262'>Myself will straight aboard, and to the state</a>
<a id='line_6263'>This heavy act with heavy heart relate.</a>
