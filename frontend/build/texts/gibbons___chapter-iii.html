<a id='line_1'>      I.</a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>     Of The Constitution Of The Roman Empire, In The Age Of The</a>
<a id='line_4'>     Antonines.</a>
<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'>      The obvious definition of a monarchy seems to be that of a state,</a>
<a id='line_7'>      in which a single person, by whatsoever name he may be</a>
<a id='line_8'>      distinguished, is intrusted with the execution of the laws, the</a>
<a id='line_9'>      management of the revenue, and the command of the army. But,</a>
<a id='line_10'>      unless public liberty is protected by intrepid and vigilant</a>
<a id='line_11'>      guardians, the authority of so formidable a magistrate will soon</a>
<a id='line_12'>      degenerate into despotism. The influence of the clergy, in an age</a>
<a id='line_13'>      of superstition, might be usefully employed to assert the rights</a>
<a id='line_14'>      of mankind; but so intimate is the connection between the throne</a>
<a id='line_15'>      and the altar, that the banner of the church has very seldom been</a>
<a id='line_16'>      seen on the side of the people. 101 A martial nobility and</a>
<a id='line_17'>      stubborn commons, possessed of arms, tenacious of property, and</a>
<a id='line_18'>      collected into constitutional assemblies, form the only balance</a>
<a id='line_19'>      capable of preserving a free constitution against enterprises of</a>
<a id='line_20'>      an aspiring prince.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>      101 (return) [ Often enough in the ages of superstition, but not</a>
<a id='line_23'>      in the interest of the people or the state, but in that of the</a>
<a id='line_24'>      church to which all others were subordinate. Yet the power of the</a>
<a id='line_25'>      pope has often been of great service in repressing the excesses</a>
<a id='line_26'>      of sovereigns, and in softening manners.—W. The history of the</a>
<a id='line_27'>      Italian republics proves the error of Gibbon, and the justice of</a>

<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>      Every barrier of the Roman constitution had been levelled by the</a>
<a id='line_31'>      vast ambition of the dictator; every fence had been extirpated by</a>
<a id='line_32'>      the cruel hand of the triumvir. After the victory of Actium, the</a>
<a id='line_33'>      fate of the Roman world depended on the will of Octavianus,</a>
<a id='line_34'>      surnamed Cæsar, by his uncle’s adoption, and afterwards Augustus,</a>
<a id='line_35'>      by the flattery of the senate. The conqueror was at the head of</a>
<a id='line_36'>      forty-four veteran legions, 1 conscious of their own strength,</a>
<a id='line_37'>      and of the weakness of the constitution, habituated, during</a>
<a id='line_38'>      twenty years’ civil war, to every act of blood and violence, and</a>
<a id='line_39'>      passionately devoted to the house of Cæsar, from whence alone</a>
<a id='line_40'>      they had received, and expected the most lavish rewards. The</a>
<a id='line_41'>      provinces, long oppressed by the ministers of the republic,</a>
<a id='line_42'>      sighed for the government of a single person, who would be the</a>
<a id='line_43'>      master, not the accomplice, of those petty tyrants. The people of</a>
<a id='line_44'>      Rome, viewing, with a secret pleasure, the humiliation of the</a>
<a id='line_45'>      aristocracy, demanded only bread and public shows; and were</a>
<a id='line_46'>      supplied with both by the liberal hand of Augustus. The rich and</a>
<a id='line_47'>      polite Italians, who had almost universally embraced the</a>
<a id='line_48'>      philosophy of Epicurus, enjoyed the present blessings of ease and</a>
<a id='line_49'>      tranquillity, and suffered not the pleasing dream to be</a>
<a id='line_50'>      interrupted by the memory of their old tumultuous freedom. With</a>
<a id='line_51'>      its power, the senate had lost its dignity; many of the most</a>
<a id='line_52'>      noble families were extinct. The republicans of spirit and</a>
<a id='line_53'>      ability had perished in the field of battle, or in the</a>
<a id='line_54'>      proscription. The door of the assembly had been designedly left</a>
<a id='line_55'>      open, for a mixed multitude of more than a thousand persons, who</a>
<a id='line_56'>      reflected disgrace upon their rank, instead of deriving honor</a>
<a id='line_57'>      from it. 2</a>

<a id='line_62'>      value when more certain may be had.—W. But all the legions,</a>
<a id='line_63'>      doubtless, submitted to Augustus after the battle of Actium.—M.]</a>
<a id='line_64'></a>
<a id='line_65'>      2 (return) [ Julius Cæsar introduced soldiers, strangers, and</a>
<a id='line_66'>      half-barbarians into the senate (Sueton. in Cæsar. c. 77, 80.)</a>
<a id='line_67'>      The abuse became still more scandalous after his death.]</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>      The reformation of the senate was one of the first steps in which</a>
<a id='line_70'>      Augustus laid aside the tyrant, and professed himself the father</a>
<a id='line_71'>      of his country. He was elected censor; and, in concert with his</a>
<a id='line_72'>      faithful Agrippa, he examined the list of the senators, expelled</a>
<a id='line_73'>      a few members, 201 whose vices or whose obstinacy required a</a>
<a id='line_74'>      public example, persuaded near two hundred to prevent the shame</a>
<a id='line_75'>      of an expulsion by a voluntary retreat, raised the qualification</a>
<a id='line_76'>      of a senator to about ten thousand pounds, created a sufficient</a>
<a id='line_77'>      number of patrician families, and accepted for himself the</a>
<a id='line_78'>      honorable title of Prince of the Senate, 202 which had always</a>
<a id='line_79'>      been bestowed, by the censors, on the citizen the most eminent</a>
<a id='line_80'>      for his honors and services. 3 But whilst he thus restored the</a>
<a id='line_81'>      dignity, he destroyed the independence, of the senate. The</a>
<a id='line_82'>      principles of a free constitution are irrecoverably lost, when</a>
<a id='line_83'>      the legislative power is nominated by the executive.</a>
<a id='line_84'></a>
<a id='line_85'>      201 (return) [ Of these Dion and Suetonius knew nothing.—W. Dion</a>
<a id='line_86'>      says the contrary.—M.]</a>
<a id='line_87'></a>
<a id='line_88'>      202 (return) [ But Augustus, then Octavius, was censor, and in</a>
<a id='line_89'>      virtue of that office, even according to the constitution of the</a>

<a id='line_92'>      Senatum legere. It was customary, during the free republic, for</a>
<a id='line_93'>      the censor to be named Princeps Senatus, (S. Liv. l. xxvii. c.</a>
<a id='line_94'>      11, l. xl. c. 51;) and Dion expressly says, that this was done</a>
<a id='line_95'>      according to ancient usage. He was empowered by a decree of the</a>
<a id='line_96'>      senate to admit a number of families among the patricians.</a>
<a id='line_97'>      Finally, the senate was not the legislative power.—W]</a>
<a id='line_98'></a>

<a id='line_100'>      c. 35.]</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>      Before an assembly thus modelled and prepared, Augustus</a>
<a id='line_103'>      pronounced a studied oration, which displayed his patriotism, and</a>
<a id='line_104'>      disguised his ambition. “He lamented, yet excused, his past</a>
<a id='line_105'>      conduct. Filial piety had required at his hands the revenge of</a>
<a id='line_106'>      his father’s murder; the humanity of his own nature had sometimes</a>
<a id='line_107'>      given way to the stern laws of necessity, and to a forced</a>
<a id='line_108'>      connection with two unworthy colleagues: as long as Antony lived,</a>
<a id='line_109'>      the republic forbade him to abandon her to a degenerate Roman,</a>
<a id='line_110'>      and a barbarian queen. He was now at liberty to satisfy his duty</a>
<a id='line_111'>      and his inclination. He solemnly restored the senate and people</a>
<a id='line_112'>      to all their ancient rights; and wished only to mingle with the</a>
<a id='line_113'>      crowd of his fellow-citizens, and to share the blessings which he</a>
<a id='line_114'>      had obtained for his country.” 4</a>
<a id='line_115'></a>
<a id='line_116'>      4 (return) [ Dion (l. liii. p. 698) gives us a prolix and bombast</a>
<a id='line_117'>      speech on this great occasion. I have borrowed from Suetonius and</a>
<a id='line_118'>      Tacitus the general language of Augustus.]</a>
<a id='line_119'></a>
<a id='line_120'>      It would require the pen of Tacitus (if Tacitus had assisted at</a>
<a id='line_121'>      this assembly) to describe the various emotions of the senate,</a>
<a id='line_122'>      those that were suppressed, and those that were affected. It was</a>
<a id='line_123'>      dangerous to trust the sincerity of Augustus; to seem to distrust</a>
<a id='line_124'>      it was still more dangerous. The respective advantages of</a>
<a id='line_125'>      monarchy and a republic have often divided speculative inquirers;</a>
<a id='line_126'>      the present greatness of the Roman state, the corruption of</a>
<a id='line_127'>      manners, and the license of the soldiers, supplied new arguments</a>
<a id='line_128'>      to the advocates of monarchy; and these general views of</a>
<a id='line_129'>      government were again warped by the hopes and fears of each</a>
<a id='line_130'>      individual. Amidst this confusion of sentiments, the answer of</a>
<a id='line_131'>      the senate was unanimous and decisive. They refused to accept the</a>
<a id='line_132'>      resignation of Augustus; they conjured him not to desert the</a>
<a id='line_133'>      republic, which he had saved. After a decent resistance, the</a>
<a id='line_134'>      crafty tyrant submitted to the orders of the senate; and</a>
<a id='line_135'>      consented to receive the government of the provinces, and the</a>
<a id='line_136'>      general command of the Roman armies, under the well-known names</a>
<a id='line_137'>      of PROCONSUL and IMPERATOR. 5 But he would receive them only for</a>
<a id='line_138'>      ten years. Even before the expiration of that period, he hope</a>
<a id='line_139'>      that the wounds of civil discord would be completely healed, and</a>
<a id='line_140'>      that the republic, restored to its pristine health and vigor,</a>
<a id='line_141'>      would no longer require the dangerous interposition of so</a>
<a id='line_142'>      extraordinary a magistrate. The memory of this comedy, repeated</a>
<a id='line_143'>      several times during the life of Augustus, was preserved to the</a>
<a id='line_144'>      last ages of the empire, by the peculiar pomp with which the</a>
<a id='line_145'>      perpetual monarchs of Rome always solemnized the tenth years of</a>
<a id='line_146'>      their reign. 6</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>      5 (return) [ Imperator (from which we have derived Emperor)</a>
<a id='line_149'>      signified under her republic no more than general, and was</a>
<a id='line_150'>      emphatically bestowed by the soldiers, when on the field of</a>
<a id='line_151'>      battle they proclaimed their victorious leader worthy of that</a>
<a id='line_152'>      title. When the Roman emperors assumed it in that sense, they</a>
<a id='line_153'>      placed it after their name, and marked how often they had taken</a>
<a id='line_154'>      it.]</a>
<a id='line_155'></a>
<a id='line_156'>      6 (return) [ Dion. l. liii. p. 703, &c.]</a>
<a id='line_157'></a>
<a id='line_158'>      Without any violation of the principles of the constitution, the</a>
<a id='line_159'>      general of the Roman armies might receive and exercise an</a>
<a id='line_160'>      authority almost despotic over the soldiers, the enemies, and the</a>
<a id='line_161'>      subjects of the republic. With regard to the soldiers, the</a>
<a id='line_162'>      jealousy of freedom had, even from the earliest ages of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_163'>      given way to the hopes of conquest, and a just sense of military</a>
<a id='line_164'>      discipline. The dictator, or consul, had a right to command the</a>
<a id='line_165'>      service of the Roman youth; and to punish an obstinate or</a>
<a id='line_166'>      cowardly disobedience by the most severe and ignominious</a>
<a id='line_167'>      penalties, by striking the offender out of the list of citizens,</a>
<a id='line_168'>      by confiscating his property, and by selling his person into</a>
<a id='line_169'>      slavery. 7 The most sacred rights of freedom, confirmed by the</a>
<a id='line_170'>      Porcian and Sempronian laws, were suspended by the military</a>
<a id='line_171'>      engagement. In his camp the general exercised an absolute power</a>
<a id='line_172'>      of life and death; his jurisdiction was not confined by any forms</a>
<a id='line_173'>      of trial, or rules of proceeding, and the execution of the</a>
<a id='line_174'>      sentence was immediate and without appeal. 8 The choice of the</a>
<a id='line_175'>      enemies of Rome was regularly decided by the legislative</a>
<a id='line_176'>      authority. The most important resolutions of peace and war were</a>
<a id='line_177'>      seriously debated in the senate, and solemnly ratified by the</a>
<a id='line_178'>      people. But when the arms of the legions were carried to a great</a>
<a id='line_179'>      distance from Italy, the general assumed the liberty of directing</a>
<a id='line_180'>      them against whatever people, and in whatever manner, they judged</a>
<a id='line_181'>      most advantageous for the public service. It was from the</a>
<a id='line_182'>      success, not from the justice, of their enterprises, that they</a>
<a id='line_183'>      expected the honors of a triumph. In the use of victory,</a>
<a id='line_184'>      especially after they were no longer controlled by the</a>
<a id='line_185'>      commissioners of the senate, they exercised the most unbounded</a>
<a id='line_186'>      despotism. When Pompey commanded in the East, he rewarded his</a>
<a id='line_187'>      soldiers and allies, dethroned princes, divided kingdoms, founded</a>
<a id='line_188'>      colonies, and distributed the treasures of Mithridates. On his</a>
<a id='line_189'>      return to Rome, he obtained, by a single act of the senate and</a>
<a id='line_190'>      people, the universal ratification of all his proceedings. 9 Such</a>
<a id='line_191'>      was the power over the soldiers, and over the enemies of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_192'>      which was either granted to, or assumed by, the generals of the</a>
<a id='line_193'>      republic. They were, at the same time, the governors, or rather</a>
<a id='line_194'>      monarchs, of the conquered provinces, united the civil with the</a>
<a id='line_195'>      military character, administered justice as well as the finances,</a>
<a id='line_196'>      and exercised both the executive and legislative power of the</a>
<a id='line_197'>      state.</a>

<a id='line_202'>      Manlius Torquatus and Papirius Cursor. They violated the laws of</a>
<a id='line_203'>      nature and humanity, but they asserted those of military</a>
<a id='line_204'>      discipline; and the people, who abhorred the action, was obliged</a>
<a id='line_205'>      to respect the principle.]</a>

<a id='line_207'>      9 (return) [ By the lavish but unconstrained suffrages of the</a>
<a id='line_208'>      people, Pompey had obtained a military command scarcely inferior</a>
<a id='line_209'>      to that of Augustus. Among the extraordinary acts of power</a>
<a id='line_210'>      executed by the former we may remark the foundation of</a>
<a id='line_211'>      twenty-nine cities, and the distribution of three or four</a>
<a id='line_212'>      millions sterling to his troops. The ratification of his acts met</a>
<a id='line_213'>      with some opposition and delays in the senate See Plutarch,</a>
<a id='line_214'>      Appian, Dion Cassius, and the first book of the epistles to</a>
<a id='line_215'>      Atticus.]</a>
<a id='line_216'></a>
<a id='line_217'>      From what has already been observed in the first chapter of this</a>
<a id='line_218'>      work, some notion may be formed of the armies and provinces thus</a>
<a id='line_219'>      intrusted to the ruling hand of Augustus. But as it was</a>
<a id='line_220'>      impossible that he could personally command the regions of so</a>
<a id='line_221'>      many distant frontiers, he was indulged by the senate, as Pompey</a>
<a id='line_222'>      had already been, in the permission of devolving the execution of</a>
<a id='line_223'>      his great office on a sufficient number of lieutenants. In rank</a>
<a id='line_224'>      and authority these officers seemed not inferior to the ancient</a>
<a id='line_225'>      proconsuls; but their station was dependent and precarious. They</a>
<a id='line_226'>      received and held their commissions at the will of a superior, to</a>
<a id='line_227'>      whose auspicious influence the merit of their action was legally</a>
<a id='line_228'>      attributed. 10 They were the representatives of the emperor. The</a>
<a id='line_229'>      emperor alone was the general of the republic, and his</a>
<a id='line_230'>      jurisdiction, civil as well as military, extended over all the</a>
<a id='line_231'>      conquests of Rome. It was some satisfaction, however, to the</a>
<a id='line_232'>      senate, that he always delegated his power to the members of</a>
<a id='line_233'>      their body. The imperial lieutenants were of consular or</a>
<a id='line_234'>      prætorian dignity; the legions were commanded by senators, and</a>
<a id='line_235'>      the præfecture of Egypt was the only important trust committed to</a>
<a id='line_236'>      a Roman knight.</a>

<a id='line_238'>      10 (return) [ Under the commonwealth, a triumph could only be</a>
<a id='line_239'>      claimed by the general, who was authorized to take the Auspices</a>
<a id='line_240'>      in the name of the people. By an exact consequence, drawn from</a>
<a id='line_241'>      this principle of policy and religion, the triumph was reserved</a>
<a id='line_242'>      to the emperor; and his most successful lieutenants were</a>
<a id='line_243'>      satisfied with some marks of distinction, which, under the name</a>
<a id='line_244'>      of triumphal honors, were invented in their favor.]</a>
<a id='line_245'></a>
<a id='line_246'>      Within six days after Augustus had been compelled to accept so</a>
<a id='line_247'>      very liberal a grant, he resolved to gratify the pride of the</a>
<a id='line_248'>      senate by an easy sacrifice. He represented to them, that they</a>
<a id='line_249'>      had enlarged his powers, even beyond that degree which might be</a>
<a id='line_250'>      required by the melancholy condition of the times. They had not</a>
<a id='line_251'>      permitted him to refuse the laborious command of the armies and</a>
<a id='line_252'>      the frontiers; but he must insist on being allowed to restore the</a>
<a id='line_253'>      more peaceful and secure provinces to the mild administration of</a>
<a id='line_254'>      the civil magistrate. In the division of the provinces, Augustus</a>
<a id='line_255'>      provided for his own power and for the dignity of the republic.</a>
<a id='line_256'>      The proconsuls of the senate, particularly those of Asia, Greece,</a>
<a id='line_257'>      and Africa, enjoyed a more honorable character than the</a>
<a id='line_258'>      lieutenants of the emperor, who commanded in Gaul or Syria. The</a>
<a id='line_259'>      former were attended by lictors, the latter by soldiers. 105 A</a>

<a id='line_281'>      By a dangerous exception to the ancient maxims, he was authorized</a>

<a id='line_291'>      Although Augustus considered a military force as the firmest</a>
<a id='line_292'>      foundation, he wisely rejected it, as a very odious instrument of</a>
<a id='line_293'>      government. It was more agreeable to his temper, as well as to</a>
<a id='line_294'>      his policy, to reign under the venerable names of ancient</a>
<a id='line_295'>      magistracy, and artfully to collect, in his own person, all the</a>
<a id='line_296'>      scattered rays of civil jurisdiction. With this view, he</a>
<a id='line_297'>      permitted the senate to confer upon him, for his life, the powers</a>
<a id='line_298'>      of the consular 11 and tribunitian offices, 12 which were, in the</a>
<a id='line_299'>      same manner, continued to all his successors. The consuls had</a>
<a id='line_300'>      succeeded to the kings of Rome, and represented the dignity of</a>
<a id='line_301'>      the state. They superintended the ceremonies of religion, levied</a>
<a id='line_302'>      and commanded the legions, gave audience to foreign ambassadors,</a>
<a id='line_303'>      and presided in the assemblies both of the senate and people. The</a>
<a id='line_304'>      general control of the finances was intrusted to their care; and</a>
<a id='line_305'>      though they seldom had leisure to administer justice in person,</a>
<a id='line_306'>      they were considered as the supreme guardians of law, equity, and</a>
<a id='line_307'>      the public peace. Such was their ordinary jurisdiction; but</a>
<a id='line_308'>      whenever the senate empowered the first magistrate to consult the</a>
<a id='line_309'>      safety of the commonwealth, he was raised by that decree above</a>
<a id='line_310'>      the laws, and exercised, in the defence of liberty, a temporary</a>
<a id='line_311'>      despotism. 13 The character of the tribunes was, in every</a>
<a id='line_312'>      respect, different from that of the consuls. The appearance of</a>
<a id='line_313'>      the former was modest and humble; but their persons were sacred</a>
<a id='line_314'>      and inviolable. Their force was suited rather for opposition than</a>
<a id='line_315'>      for action. They were instituted to defend the oppressed, to</a>
<a id='line_316'>      pardon offences, to arraign the enemies of the people, and, when</a>
<a id='line_317'>      they judged it necessary, to stop, by a single word, the whole</a>
<a id='line_318'>      machine of government. As long as the republic subsisted, the</a>
<a id='line_319'>      dangerous influence, which either the consul or the tribune might</a>
<a id='line_320'>      derive from their respective jurisdiction, was diminished by</a>
<a id='line_321'>      several important restrictions. Their authority expired with the</a>
<a id='line_322'>      year in which they were elected; the former office was divided</a>

<a id='line_462'>      the most frequent and serious occupation of the senate; and the</a>
<a id='line_463'>      important causes that were pleaded before them afforded a last</a>
<a id='line_464'>      refuge to the spirit of ancient eloquence. As a council of state,</a>
<a id='line_465'>      and as a court of justice, the senate possessed very considerable</a>
<a id='line_466'>      prerogatives; but in its legislative capacity, in which it was</a>
<a id='line_467'>      supposed virtually to represent the people, the rights of</a>
<a id='line_468'>      sovereignty were acknowledged to reside in that assembly. Every</a>
<a id='line_469'>      power was derived from their authority, every law was ratified by</a>
<a id='line_470'>      their sanction. Their regular meetings were held on three stated</a>
<a id='line_471'>      days in every month, the Calends, the Nones, and the Ides. The</a>

<a id='line_519'>      Alexander the first objects, of this servile and impious mode of</a>
<a id='line_520'>      adulation. 211 It was easily transferred from the kings to the</a>
<a id='line_521'>      governors of Asia; and the Roman magistrates very frequently were</a>
<a id='line_522'>      adored as provincial deities, with the pomp of altars and</a>
<a id='line_523'>      temples, of festivals and sacrifices. 22 It was natural that the</a>
<a id='line_524'>      emperors should not refuse what the proconsuls had accepted; and</a>
<a id='line_525'>      the divine honors which both the one and the other received from</a>
<a id='line_526'>      the provinces, attested rather the despotism than the servitude</a>
<a id='line_527'>      of Rome. But the conquerors soon imitated the vanquished nations</a>
<a id='line_528'>      in the arts of flattery; and the imperious spirit of the first</a>
<a id='line_529'>      Cæsar too easily consented to assume, during his lifetime, a</a>
<a id='line_530'>      place among the tutelar deities of Rome. The milder temper of his</a>

<a id='line_532'>      afterwards revived, except by the madness of Caligula and</a>
<a id='line_533'>      Domitian. Augustus permitted indeed some of the provincial cities</a>
<a id='line_534'>      to erect temples to his honor, on condition that they should</a>
<a id='line_535'>      associate the worship of Rome with that of the sovereign; he</a>
<a id='line_536'>      tolerated private superstition, of which he might be the object;</a>
<a id='line_537'>      23 but he contented himself with being revered by the senate and</a>
<a id='line_538'>      the people in his human character, and wisely left to his</a>
<a id='line_539'>      successor the care of his public deification. A regular custom</a>
<a id='line_540'>      was introduced, that on the decease of every emperor who had</a>
<a id='line_541'>      neither lived nor died like a tyrant, the senate by a solemn</a>
<a id='line_542'>      decree should place him in the number of the gods: and the</a>
<a id='line_543'>      ceremonies of his apotheosis were blended with those of his</a>
<a id='line_544'>      funeral. 231 This legal, and, as it should seem, injudicious</a>
<a id='line_545'>      profanation, so abhorrent to our stricter principles, was</a>
<a id='line_546'>      received with a very faint murmur, 24 by the easy nature of</a>
<a id='line_547'>      Polytheism; but it was received as an institution, not of</a>

<a id='line_549'>      Antonines by comparing them with the vices of Hercules or</a>

<a id='line_1297'>      frontiers, his anxious view could discover nothing, except the</a>
<a id='line_1298'>      ocean, inhospitable deserts, hostile tribes of barbarians, of</a>
<a id='line_1299'>      fierce manners and unknown language, or dependent kings, who</a>
<a id='line_1300'>      would gladly purchase the emperor’s protection by the sacrifice</a>
