<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>      The review of the nations from the Danube to the Nile has</a>
<a id='line_10'>      exposed, on every side, the weakness of the Romans; and our</a>
<a id='line_11'>      wonder is reasonably excited that they should presume to enlarge</a>
<a id='line_12'>      an empire whose ancient limits they were incapable of defending.</a>
<a id='line_13'>      But the wars, the conquests, and the triumphs of Justinian, are</a>
<a id='line_14'>      the feeble and pernicious efforts of old age, which exhaust the</a>
<a id='line_15'>      remains of strength, and accelerate the decay of the powers of</a>
<a id='line_16'>      life. He exulted in the glorious act of restoring Africa and</a>
<a id='line_17'>      Italy to the republic; but the calamities which followed the</a>
<a id='line_18'>      departure of Belisarius betrayed the impotence of the conqueror,</a>
<a id='line_19'>      and accomplished the ruin of those unfortunate countries.</a>
<a id='line_20'></a>
<a id='line_21'>      From his new acquisitions, Justinian expected that his avarice,</a>
<a id='line_22'>      as well as pride, should be richly gratified. A rapacious</a>
<a id='line_23'>      minister of the finances closely pursued the footsteps of</a>
<a id='line_24'>      Belisarius; and as the old registers of tribute had been burnt by</a>
<a id='line_25'>      the Vandals, he indulged his fancy in a liberal calculation and</a>
<a id='line_26'>      arbitrary assessment of the wealth of Africa. 1 The increase of</a>
<a id='line_27'>      taxes, which were drawn away by a distant sovereign, and a</a>
<a id='line_28'>      general resumption of the patrimony or crown lands, soon</a>
<a id='line_29'>      dispelled the intoxication of the public joy: but the emperor was</a>
<a id='line_30'>      insensible to the modest complaints of the people, till he was</a>
<a id='line_31'>      awakened and alarmed by the clamors of military discontent. Many</a>
<a id='line_32'>      of the Roman soldiers had married the widows and daughters of the</a>
<a id='line_33'>      Vandals. As their own, by the double right of conquest and</a>
<a id='line_34'>      inheritance, they claimed the estates which Genseric had assigned</a>
<a id='line_35'>      to his victorious troops. They heard with disdain the cold and</a>
<a id='line_36'>      selfish representations of their officers, that the liberality of</a>
<a id='line_37'>      Justinian had raised them from a savage or servile condition;</a>
<a id='line_38'>      that they were already enriched by the spoils of Africa, the</a>
<a id='line_39'>      treasure, the slaves, and the movables of the vanquished</a>
<a id='line_40'>      Barbarians; and that the ancient and lawful patrimony of the</a>
<a id='line_41'>      emperors would be applied only to the support of that government</a>
<a id='line_42'>      on which their own safety and reward must ultimately depend. The</a>
<a id='line_43'>      mutiny was secretly inflamed by a thousand soldiers, for the most</a>
<a id='line_44'>      part Heruli, who had imbibed the doctrines, and were instigated</a>
<a id='line_45'>      by the clergy, of the Arian sect; and the cause of perjury and</a>
<a id='line_46'>      rebellion was sanctified by the dispensing powers of fanaticism.</a>
<a id='line_47'>      The Arians deplored the ruin of their church, triumphant above a</a>
<a id='line_48'>      century in Africa; and they were justly provoked by the laws of</a>
<a id='line_49'>      the conqueror, which interdicted the baptism of their children,</a>
<a id='line_50'>      and the exercise of all religious worship. Of the Vandals chosen</a>
<a id='line_51'>      by Belisarius, the far greater part, in the honors of the Eastern</a>
<a id='line_52'>      service, forgot their country and religion. But a generous band</a>
<a id='line_53'>      of four hundred obliged the mariners, when they were in sight of</a>
<a id='line_54'>      the Isle of Lesbos, to alter their course: they touched on</a>
<a id='line_55'>      Peloponnesus, ran ashore on a desert coast of Africa, and boldly</a>
<a id='line_56'>      erected, on Mount Aurasius, the standard of independence and</a>
<a id='line_57'>      revolt. While the troops of the provinces disclaimed the commands</a>
<a id='line_58'>      of their superiors, a conspiracy was formed at Carthage against</a>
<a id='line_59'>      the life of Solomon, who filled with honor the place of</a>
<a id='line_60'>      Belisarius; and the Arians had piously resolved to sacrifice the</a>
<a id='line_61'>      tyrant at the foot of the altar, during the awful mysteries of</a>
<a id='line_62'>      the festival of Easter. Fear or remorse restrained the daggers of</a>
<a id='line_63'>      the assassins, but the patience of Solomon emboldened their</a>
<a id='line_64'>      discontent; and, at the end of ten days, a furious sedition was</a>
<a id='line_65'>      kindled in the Circus, which desolated Africa above ten years.</a>
<a id='line_66'>      The pillage of the city, and the indiscriminate slaughter of its</a>
<a id='line_67'>      inhabitants, were suspended only by darkness, sleep, and</a>
<a id='line_68'>      intoxication: the governor, with seven companions, among whom was</a>
<a id='line_69'>      the historian Procopius, escaped to Sicily: two thirds of the</a>
<a id='line_70'>      army were involved in the guilt of treason; and eight thousand</a>
<a id='line_71'>      insurgents, assembling in the field of Bulla, elected Stoza for</a>
<a id='line_72'>      their chief, a private soldier, who possessed in a superior</a>
<a id='line_73'>      degree the virtues of a rebel. Under the mask of freedom, his</a>
<a id='line_74'>      eloquence could lead, or at least impel, the passions of his</a>
<a id='line_75'>      equals. He raised himself to a level with Belisarius, and the</a>
<a id='line_76'>      nephew of the emperor, by daring to encounter them in the field;</a>
<a id='line_77'>      and the victorious generals were compelled to acknowledge that</a>
<a id='line_78'>      Stoza deserved a purer cause, and a more legitimate command.</a>
<a id='line_79'>      Vanquished in battle, he dexterously employed the arts of</a>
<a id='line_80'>      negotiation; a Roman army was seduced from their allegiance, and</a>
<a id='line_81'>      the chiefs who had trusted to his faithless promise were murdered</a>
<a id='line_82'>      by his order in a church of Numidia. When every resource, either</a>
<a id='line_83'>      of force or perfidy, was exhausted, Stoza, with some desperate</a>
<a id='line_84'>      Vandals, retired to the wilds of Mauritania, obtained the</a>
<a id='line_85'>      daughter of a Barbarian prince, and eluded the pursuit of his</a>
<a id='line_86'>      enemies, by the report of his death. The personal weight of</a>
<a id='line_87'>      Belisarius, the rank, the spirit, and the temper, of Germanus,</a>
<a id='line_88'>      the emperor’s nephew, and the vigor and success of the second</a>
<a id='line_89'>      administration of the eunuch Solomon, restored the modesty of the</a>
<a id='line_90'>      camp, and maintained for a while the tranquillity of Africa. But</a>
<a id='line_91'>      the vices of the Byzantine court were felt in that distant</a>
<a id='line_92'>      province; the troops complained that they were neither paid nor</a>
<a id='line_93'>      relieved, and as soon as the public disorders were sufficiently</a>
<a id='line_94'>      mature, Stoza was again alive, in arms, and at the gates of</a>
<a id='line_95'>      Carthage. He fell in a single combat, but he smiled in the</a>
<a id='line_96'>      agonies of death, when he was informed that his own javelin had</a>
<a id='line_97'>      reached the heart of his antagonist. 1001 The example of Stoza,</a>
<a id='line_98'>      and the assurance that a fortunate soldier had been the first</a>
<a id='line_99'>      king, encouraged the ambition of Gontharis, and he promised, by a</a>
<a id='line_100'>      private treaty, to divide Africa with the Moors, if, with their</a>
<a id='line_101'>      dangerous aid, he should ascend the throne of Carthage. The</a>
<a id='line_102'>      feeble Areobindus, unskilled in the affairs of peace and war, was</a>
<a id='line_103'>      raised, by his marriage with the niece of Justinian, to the</a>
<a id='line_104'>      office of exarch. He was suddenly oppressed by a sedition of the</a>
<a id='line_105'>      guards, and his abject supplications, which provoked the</a>
<a id='line_106'>      contempt, could not move the pity, of the inexorable tyrant.</a>
<a id='line_107'>      After a reign of thirty days, Gontharis himself was stabbed at a</a>
<a id='line_108'>      banquet by the hand of Artaban; 1002 and it is singular enough,</a>
<a id='line_109'>      that an Armenian prince, of the royal family of Arsaces, should</a>
<a id='line_110'>      reestablish at Carthage the authority of the Roman empire. In the</a>
<a id='line_111'>      conspiracy which unsheathed the dagger of Brutus against the life</a>
<a id='line_112'>      of Caesar, every circumstance is curious and important to the</a>
<a id='line_113'>      eyes of posterity; but the guilt or merit of these loyal or</a>
<a id='line_114'>      rebellious assassins could interest only the contemporaries of</a>
<a id='line_115'>      Procopius, who, by their hopes and fears, their friendship or</a>
<a id='line_116'>      resentment, were personally engaged in the revolutions of Africa.</a>

<a id='line_156'>      uttered a sentiment not unworthy of a Roman patriot: “If I fail,”</a>
<a id='line_157'>      said Artasires, “in the first stroke, kill me on the spot, lest</a>
<a id='line_158'>      the rack should extort a discovery of my accomplices.”]</a>
<a id='line_159'></a>
<a id='line_160'>      That country was rapidly sinking into the state of barbarism from</a>
<a id='line_161'>      whence it had been raised by the Phoenician colonies and Roman</a>
<a id='line_162'>      laws; and every step of intestine discord was marked by some</a>
<a id='line_163'>      deplorable victory of savage man over civilized society. The</a>
<a id='line_164'>      Moors, 3 though ignorant of justice, were impatient of</a>
<a id='line_165'>      oppression: their vagrant life and boundless wilderness</a>
<a id='line_166'>      disappointed the arms, and eluded the chains, of a conqueror; and</a>
<a id='line_167'>      experience had shown, that neither oaths nor obligations could</a>
<a id='line_168'>      secure the fidelity of their attachment. The victory of Mount</a>
<a id='line_169'>      Auras had awed them into momentary submission; but if they</a>
<a id='line_170'>      respected the character of Solomon, they hated and despised the</a>
<a id='line_171'>      pride and luxury of his two nephews, Cyrus and Sergius, on whom</a>
<a id='line_172'>      their uncle had imprudently bestowed the provincial governments</a>
<a id='line_173'>      of Tripoli and Pentapolis. A Moorish tribe encamped under the</a>
<a id='line_174'>      walls of Leptis, to renew their alliance, and receive from the</a>
<a id='line_175'>      governor the customary gifts. Fourscore of their deputies were</a>
<a id='line_176'>      introduced as friends into the city; but on the dark suspicion of</a>
<a id='line_177'>      a conspiracy, they were massacred at the table of Sergius, and</a>
<a id='line_178'>      the clamor of arms and revenge was reechoed through the valleys</a>
<a id='line_179'>      of Mount Atlas from both the Syrtes to the Atlantic Ocean. A</a>
<a id='line_180'>      personal injury, the unjust execution or murder of his brother,</a>
<a id='line_181'>      rendered Antalas the enemy of the Romans. The defeat of the</a>
<a id='line_182'>      Vandals had formerly signalized his valor; the rudiments of</a>
<a id='line_183'>      justice and prudence were still more conspicuous in a Moor; and</a>
<a id='line_184'>      while he laid Adrumetum in ashes, he calmly admonished the</a>
<a id='line_185'>      emperor that the peace of Africa might be secured by the recall</a>
<a id='line_186'>      of Solomon and his unworthy nephews. The exarch led forth his</a>
<a id='line_187'>      troops from Carthage: but, at the distance of six days’ journey,</a>
<a id='line_188'>      in the neighborhood of Tebeste, 4 he was astonished by the</a>
<a id='line_189'>      superior numbers and fierce aspect of the Barbarians. He proposed</a>
<a id='line_190'>      a treaty; solicited a reconciliation; and offered to bind himself</a>
<a id='line_191'>      by the most solemn oaths. “By what oaths can he bind himself?”</a>
<a id='line_192'>      interrupted the indignant Moors. “Will he swear by the Gospels,</a>
<a id='line_193'>      the divine books of the Christians? It was on those books that</a>
<a id='line_194'>      the faith of his nephew Sergius was pledged to eighty of our</a>
<a id='line_195'>      innocent and unfortunate brethren. Before we trust them a second</a>
<a id='line_196'>      time, let us try their efficacy in the chastisement of perjury</a>
<a id='line_197'>      and the vindication of their own honor.” Their honor was</a>
<a id='line_198'>      vindicated in the field of Tebeste, by the death of Solomon, and</a>
<a id='line_199'>      the total loss of his army. 411 The arrival of fresh troops and</a>
<a id='line_200'>      more skilful commanders soon checked the insolence of the Moors:</a>
<a id='line_201'>      seventeen of their princes were slain in the same battle; and the</a>
<a id='line_202'>      doubtful and transient submission of their tribes was celebrated</a>
<a id='line_203'>      with lavish applause by the people of Constantinople. Successive</a>
<a id='line_204'>      inroads had reduced the province of Africa to one third of the</a>
<a id='line_205'>      measure of Italy; yet the Roman emperors continued to reign above</a>
<a id='line_206'>      a century over Carthage and the fruitful coast of the</a>
<a id='line_207'>      Mediterranean. But the victories and the losses of Justinian were</a>
<a id='line_208'>      alike pernicious to mankind; and such was the desolation of</a>
<a id='line_209'>      Africa, that in many parts a stranger might wander whole days</a>
<a id='line_210'>      without meeting the face either of a friend or an enemy. The</a>
<a id='line_211'>      nation of the Vandals had disappeared: they once amounted to a</a>
<a id='line_212'>      hundred and sixty thousand warriors, without including the</a>
<a id='line_213'>      children, the women, or the slaves. Their numbers were infinitely</a>
<a id='line_214'>      surpassed by the number of the Moorish families extirpated in a</a>
<a id='line_215'>      relentless war; and the same destruction was retaliated on the</a>
<a id='line_216'>      Romans and their allies, who perished by the climate, their</a>
<a id='line_217'>      mutual quarrels, and the rage of the Barbarians. When Procopius</a>
<a id='line_218'>      first landed, he admired the populousness of the cities and</a>
<a id='line_219'>      country, strenuously exercised in the labors of commerce and</a>
<a id='line_220'>      agriculture. In less than twenty years, that busy scene was</a>
<a id='line_221'>      converted into a silent solitude; the wealthy citizens escaped to</a>
<a id='line_222'>      Sicily and Constantinople; and the secret historian has</a>
<a id='line_223'>      confidently affirmed, that five millions of Africans were</a>
<a id='line_224'>      consumed by the wars and government of the emperor Justinian. 5</a>

<a id='line_251'>      of Justinian to deceive and reject them. They had lost their</a>
<a id='line_252'>      king, (an inconsiderable loss,) their capital, their treasures,</a>
<a id='line_253'>      the provinces from Sicily to the Alps, and the military force of</a>

<a id='line_255'>      horses and arms. Yet all was not lost, as long as Pavia was</a>
<a id='line_256'>      defended by one thousand Goths, inspired by a sense of honor, the</a>
<a id='line_257'>      love of freedom, and the memory of their past greatness. The</a>
<a id='line_258'>      supreme command was unanimously offered to the brave Uraias; and</a>
<a id='line_259'>      it was in his eyes alone that the disgrace of his uncle Vitiges</a>
<a id='line_260'>      could appear as a reason of exclusion. His voice inclined the</a>
<a id='line_261'>      election in favor of Hildibald, whose personal merit was</a>
<a id='line_262'>      recommended by the vain hope that his kinsman Theudes, the</a>
<a id='line_263'>      Spanish monarch, would support the common interest of the Gothic</a>
<a id='line_264'>      nation. The success of his arms in Liguria and Venetia seemed to</a>
<a id='line_265'>      justify their choice; but he soon declared to the world that he</a>
<a id='line_266'>      was incapable of forgiving or commanding his benefactor. The</a>
<a id='line_267'>      consort of Hildibald was deeply wounded by the beauty, the</a>
<a id='line_268'>      riches, and the pride, of the wife of Uraias; and the death of</a>
<a id='line_269'>      that virtuous patriot excited the indignation of a free people. A</a>
<a id='line_270'>      bold assassin executed their sentence by striking off the head of</a>
<a id='line_271'>      Hildibald in the midst of a banquet; the Rugians, a foreign</a>
<a id='line_272'>      tribe, assumed the privilege of election: and Totila, 611 the</a>
<a id='line_273'>      nephew of the late king, was tempted, by revenge, to deliver</a>

<a id='line_305'>      lost in a few days by the lance of a Barbarian, who had defied</a>

<a id='line_315'>      blushed for the baseness of his enemies, pursued with rapid steps</a>
<a id='line_316'>      the path of honor and victory. Totila passed the Po, 6112</a>
<a id='line_317'>      traversed the Apennine, suspended the important conquest of</a>
<a id='line_318'>      Ravenna, Florence, and Rome, and marched through the heart of</a>
<a id='line_319'>      Italy, to form the siege or rather the blockade, of Naples. The</a>
<a id='line_320'>      Roman chiefs, imprisoned in their respective cities, and accusing</a>
<a id='line_321'>      each other of the common disgrace, did not presume to disturb his</a>
<a id='line_322'>      enterprise. But the emperor, alarmed by the distress and danger</a>
<a id='line_323'>      of his Italian conquests, despatched to the relief of Naples a</a>

<a id='line_349'>      revolution which three years’ experience had produced in the</a>
<a id='line_350'>      sentiments of the Italians. At the command, or at least in the</a>

<a id='line_355'>      Rome, Ravenna, Florence, Perugia, Spoleto, &c., who abused their</a>
<a id='line_356'>      authority for the indulgence of lust or avarice. The improvement</a>
<a id='line_357'>      of the revenue was committed to Alexander, a subtle scribe, long</a>
<a id='line_358'>      practised in the fraud and oppression of the Byzantine schools,</a>
<a id='line_359'>      and whose name of Psalliction, the scissors, 9 was drawn from the</a>
<a id='line_360'>      dexterous artifice with which he reduced the size without</a>
<a id='line_361'>      defacing the figure, of the gold coin. Instead of expecting the</a>
<a id='line_362'>      restoration of peace and industry, he imposed a heavy assessment</a>
<a id='line_363'>      on the fortunes of the Italians. Yet his present or future</a>
<a id='line_364'>      demands were less odious than a prosecution of arbitrary rigor</a>
<a id='line_365'>      against the persons and property of all those who, under the</a>
<a id='line_366'>      Gothic kings, had been concerned in the receipt and expenditure</a>
<a id='line_367'>      of the public money. The subjects of Justinian, who escaped these</a>
<a id='line_368'>      partial vexations, were oppressed by the irregular maintenance of</a>
<a id='line_369'>      the soldiers, whom Alexander defrauded and despised; and their</a>
<a id='line_370'>      hasty sallies in quest of wealth, or subsistence, provoked the</a>
<a id='line_371'>      inhabitants of the country to await or implore their deliverance</a>
<a id='line_372'>      from the virtues of a Barbarian. Totila 10 was chaste and</a>
<a id='line_373'>      temperate; and none were deceived, either friends or enemies, who</a>
<a id='line_374'>      depended on his faith or his clemency. To the husbandmen of Italy</a>
<a id='line_375'>      the Gothic king issued a welcome proclamation, enjoining them to</a>
<a id='line_376'>      pursue their important labors, and to rest assured, that, on the</a>
<a id='line_377'>      payment of the ordinary taxes, they should be defended by his</a>
<a id='line_378'>      valor and discipline from the injuries of war. The strong towns</a>
<a id='line_379'>      he successively attacked; and as soon as they had yielded to his</a>
<a id='line_380'>      arms, he demolished the fortifications, to save the people from</a>
<a id='line_381'>      the calamities of a future siege, to deprive the Romans of the</a>
<a id='line_382'>      arts of defence, and to decide the tedious quarrel of the two</a>
<a id='line_383'>      nations, by an equal and honorable conflict in the field of</a>
<a id='line_384'>      battle. The Roman captives and deserters were tempted to enlist</a>
<a id='line_385'>      in the service of a liberal and courteous adversary; the slaves</a>
<a id='line_386'>      were attracted by the firm and faithful promise, that they should</a>
<a id='line_387'>      never be delivered to their masters; and from the thousand</a>
<a id='line_388'>      warriors of Pavia, a new people, under the same appellation of</a>
<a id='line_389'>      Goths, was insensibly formed in the camp of Totila. He sincerely</a>
<a id='line_390'>      accomplished the articles of capitulation, without seeking or</a>
<a id='line_391'>      accepting any sinister advantage from ambiguous expressions or</a>
<a id='line_392'>      unforeseen events: the garrison of Naples had stipulated that</a>
<a id='line_393'>      they should be transported by sea; the obstinacy of the winds</a>
<a id='line_394'>      prevented their voyage, but they were generously supplied with</a>
<a id='line_395'>      horses, provisions, and a safe-conduct to the gates of Rome. The</a>
<a id='line_396'>      wives of the senators, who had been surprised in the villas of</a>
<a id='line_397'>      Campania, were restored, without a ransom, to their husbands; the</a>
<a id='line_398'>      violation of female chastity was inexorably chastised with death;</a>
<a id='line_399'>      and in the salutary regulation of the edict of the famished</a>
<a id='line_400'>      Neapolitans, the conqueror assumed the office of a humane and</a>

<a id='line_402'>      whether they proceeded from true policy, religious principle, or</a>
<a id='line_403'>      the instinct of humanity: he often harangued his troops; and it</a>
<a id='line_404'>      was his constant theme, that national vice and ruin are</a>
<a id='line_405'>      inseparably connected; that victory is the fruit of moral as well</a>

<a id='line_443'>      suspended for a while the conquest of Persia, and listened to the</a>
<a id='line_444'>      prayers of his Italian subjects. He gently touched on the causes</a>

<a id='line_455'>      Barbarian; and his own epistle exhibits a genuine and lively</a>

<a id='line_500'>      was afflicted by the avarice, and guarded by the valor, of</a>
<a id='line_501'>      Bessas, a veteran chief of Gothic extraction, who filled, with a</a>
<a id='line_502'>      garrison of three thousand soldiers, the spacious circle of her</a>
<a id='line_503'>      venerable walls. From the distress of the people he extracted a</a>
<a id='line_504'>      profitable trade, and secretly rejoiced in the continuance of the</a>
<a id='line_505'>      siege. It was for his use that the granaries had been</a>
<a id='line_506'>      replenished: the charity of Pope Vigilius had purchased and</a>
<a id='line_507'>      embarked an ample supply of Sicilian corn; but the vessels which</a>
<a id='line_508'>      escaped the Barbarians were seized by a rapacious governor, who</a>
<a id='line_509'>      imparted a scanty sustenance to the soldiers, and sold the</a>
<a id='line_510'>      remainder to the wealthy Romans. The medimnus, or fifth part of</a>
<a id='line_511'>      the quarter of wheat, was exchanged for seven pieces of gold;</a>
<a id='line_512'>      fifty pieces were given for an ox, a rare and accidental prize;</a>
<a id='line_513'>      the progress of famine enhanced this exorbitant value, and the</a>
<a id='line_514'>      mercenaries were tempted to deprive themselves of the allowance</a>
<a id='line_515'>      which was scarcely sufficient for the support of life. A</a>
<a id='line_516'>      tasteless and unwholesome mixture, in which the bran thrice</a>
<a id='line_517'>      exceeded the quantity of flour, appeased the hunger of the poor;</a>
<a id='line_518'>      they were gradually reduced to feed on dead horses, dogs, cats,</a>
<a id='line_519'>      and mice, and eagerly to snatch the grass, and even the nettles,</a>
<a id='line_520'>      which grew among the ruins of the city. A crowd of spectres, pale</a>
<a id='line_521'>      and emaciated, their bodies oppressed with disease, and their</a>
<a id='line_522'>      minds with despair, surrounded the palace of the governor, urged,</a>
<a id='line_523'>      with unavailing truth, that it was the duty of a master to</a>
<a id='line_524'>      maintain his slaves, and humbly requested that he would provide</a>
<a id='line_525'>      for their subsistence, to permit their flight, or command their</a>
<a id='line_526'>      immediate execution. Bessas replied, with unfeeling tranquillity,</a>
<a id='line_527'>      that it was impossible to feed, unsafe to dismiss, and unlawful</a>
<a id='line_528'>      to kill, the subjects of the emperor. Yet the example of a</a>
<a id='line_529'>      private citizen might have shown his countrymen that a tyrant</a>
<a id='line_530'>      cannot withhold the privilege of death. Pierced by the cries of</a>
<a id='line_531'>      five children, who vainly called on their father for bread, he</a>
<a id='line_532'>      ordered them to follow his steps, advanced with calm and silent</a>
<a id='line_533'>      despair to one of the bridges of the Tyber, and, covering his</a>
<a id='line_534'>      face, threw himself headlong into the stream, in the presence of</a>
<a id='line_535'>      his family and the Roman people. To the rich and pusillammous,</a>
<a id='line_536'>      Bessas 12 sold the permission of departure; but the greatest part</a>
<a id='line_537'>      of the fugitives expired on the public highways, or were</a>
<a id='line_538'>      intercepted by the flying parties of Barbarians. In the mean</a>
<a id='line_539'>      while, the artful governor soothed the discontent, and revived</a>
<a id='line_540'>      the hopes of the Romans, by the vague reports of the fleets and</a>
<a id='line_541'>      armies which were hastening to their relief from the extremities</a>
<a id='line_542'>      of the East. They derived more rational comfort from the</a>
<a id='line_543'>      assurance that Belisarius had landed at the port; and, without</a>
<a id='line_544'>      numbering his forces, they firmly relied on the humanity, the</a>
<a id='line_545'>      courage, and the skill of their great deliverer.</a>

<a id='line_560'>      Justinian.—Part II.</a>
<a id='line_561'></a>
<a id='line_562'>      The foresight of Totila had raised obstacles worthy of such an</a>
<a id='line_563'>      antagonist. Ninety furlongs below the city, in the narrowest part</a>
<a id='line_564'>      of the river, he joined the two banks by strong and solid timbers</a>
<a id='line_565'>      in the form of a bridge, on which he erected two lofty towers,</a>
<a id='line_566'>      manned by the bravest of his Goths, and profusely stored with</a>
<a id='line_567'>      missile weapons and engines of offence. The approach of the</a>
<a id='line_568'>      bridge and towers was covered by a strong and massy chain of</a>
<a id='line_569'>      iron; and the chain, at either end, on the opposite sides of the</a>
<a id='line_570'>      Tyber, was defended by a numerous and chosen detachment of</a>
<a id='line_571'>      archers. But the enterprise of forcing these barriers, and</a>
<a id='line_572'>      relieving the capital, displays a shining example of the boldness</a>
<a id='line_573'>      and conduct of Belisarius. His cavalry advanced from the port</a>
<a id='line_574'>      along the public road, to awe the motions, and distract the</a>
<a id='line_575'>      attention of the enemy. His infantry and provisions were</a>
<a id='line_576'>      distributed in two hundred large boats; and each boat was</a>
<a id='line_577'>      shielded by a high rampart of thick planks, pierced with many</a>
<a id='line_578'>      small holes for the discharge of missile weapons. In the front,</a>
<a id='line_579'>      two large vessels were linked together to sustain a floating</a>
<a id='line_580'>      castle, which commanded the towers of the bridge, and contained a</a>
<a id='line_581'>      magazine of fire, sulphur, and bitumen. The whole fleet, which</a>
<a id='line_582'>      the general led in person, was laboriously moved against the</a>
<a id='line_583'>      current of the river. The chain yielded to their weight, and the</a>
<a id='line_584'>      enemies who guarded the banks were either slain or scattered. As</a>
<a id='line_585'>      soon as they touched the principal barrier, the fire-ship was</a>
<a id='line_586'>      instantly grappled to the bridge; one of the towers, with two</a>
<a id='line_587'>      hundred Goths, was consumed by the flames; the assailants shouted</a>
<a id='line_588'>      victory; and Rome was saved, if the wisdom of Belisarius had not</a>
<a id='line_589'>      been defeated by the misconduct of his officers. He had</a>
<a id='line_590'>      previously sent orders to Bessas to second his operations by a</a>
<a id='line_591'>      timely sally from the town; and he had fixed his lieutenant,</a>
<a id='line_592'>      Isaac, by a peremptory command, to the station of the port. But</a>
<a id='line_593'>      avarice rendered Bessas immovable; while the youthful ardor of</a>
<a id='line_594'>      Isaac delivered him into the hands of a superior enemy. The</a>
<a id='line_595'>      exaggerated rumor of his defeat was hastily carried to the ears</a>
<a id='line_596'>      of Belisarius: he paused; betrayed in that single moment of his</a>
<a id='line_597'>      life some emotions of surprise and perplexity; and reluctantly</a>
<a id='line_598'>      sounded a retreat to save his wife Antonina, his treasures, and</a>
<a id='line_599'>      the only harbor which he possessed on the Tuscan coast. The</a>
<a id='line_600'>      vexation of his mind produced an ardent and almost mortal fever;</a>
<a id='line_601'>      and Rome was left without protection to the mercy or indignation</a>
<a id='line_602'>      of Totila. The continuance of hostilities had imbittered the</a>
<a id='line_603'>      national hatred: the Arian clergy was ignominiously driven from</a>
<a id='line_604'>      Rome; Pelagius, the archdeacon, returned without success from an</a>
<a id='line_605'>      embassy to the Gothic camp; and a Sicilian bishop, the envoy or</a>
<a id='line_606'>      nuncio of the pope, was deprived of both his hands, for daring to</a>
<a id='line_607'>      utter falsehoods in the service of the church and state.</a>
<a id='line_608'></a>
<a id='line_609'>      Famine had relaxed the strength and discipline of the garrison of</a>
<a id='line_610'>      Rome. They could derive no effectual service from a dying people;</a>
<a id='line_611'>      and the inhuman avarice of the merchant at length absorbed the</a>
<a id='line_612'>      vigilance of the governor. Four Isaurian sentinels, while their</a>
<a id='line_613'>      companions slept, and their officers were absent, descended by a</a>
<a id='line_614'>      rope from the wall, and secretly proposed to the Gothic king to</a>
<a id='line_615'>      introduce his troops into the city. The offer was entertained</a>
<a id='line_616'>      with coldness and suspicion; they returned in safety; they twice</a>
<a id='line_617'>      repeated their visit; the place was twice examined; the</a>
<a id='line_618'>      conspiracy was known and disregarded; and no sooner had Totila</a>
<a id='line_619'>      consented to the attempt, than they unbarred the Asinarian gate,</a>
<a id='line_620'>      and gave admittance to the Goths. Till the dawn of day, they</a>
<a id='line_621'>      halted in order of battle, apprehensive of treachery or ambush;</a>
<a id='line_622'>      but the troops of Bessas, with their leader, had already escaped;</a>
<a id='line_623'>      and when the king was pressed to disturb their retreat, he</a>
<a id='line_624'>      prudently replied, that no sight could be more grateful than that</a>
<a id='line_625'>      of a flying enemy. The patricians, who were still possessed of</a>
<a id='line_626'>      horses, Decius, Basilius, &c. accompanied the governor; their</a>
<a id='line_627'>      brethren, among whom Olybrius, Orestes, and Maximus, are named by</a>
<a id='line_628'>      the historian, took refuge in the church of St. Peter: but the</a>
<a id='line_629'>      assertion, that only five hundred persons remained in the</a>
<a id='line_630'>      capital, inspires some doubt of the fidelity either of his</a>
<a id='line_631'>      narrative or of his text. As soon as daylight had displayed the</a>
<a id='line_632'>      entire victory of the Goths, their monarch devoutly visited the</a>
<a id='line_633'>      tomb of the prince of the apostles; but while he prayed at the</a>
<a id='line_634'>      altar, twenty-five soldiers, and sixty citizens, were put to the</a>
<a id='line_635'>      sword in the vestibule of the temple. The archdeacon Pelagius 13</a>
<a id='line_636'>      stood before him, with the Gospels in his hand. “O Lord, be</a>
<a id='line_637'>      merciful to your servant.” “Pelagius,” said Totila, with an</a>
<a id='line_638'>      insulting smile, “your pride now condescends to become a</a>
<a id='line_639'>      suppliant.” “I am a suppliant,” replied the prudent archdeacon;</a>
<a id='line_640'>      “God has now made us your subjects, and as your subjects, we are</a>
<a id='line_641'>      entitled to your clemency.” At his humble prayer, the lives of</a>
<a id='line_642'>      the Romans were spared; and the chastity of the maids and matrons</a>
<a id='line_643'>      was preserved inviolate from the passions of the hungry soldiers.</a>
<a id='line_644'></a>
<a id='line_645'>      But they were rewarded by the freedom of pillage, after the most</a>
<a id='line_646'>      precious spoils had been reserved for the royal treasury. The</a>
<a id='line_647'>      houses of the senators were plentifully stored with gold and</a>
<a id='line_648'>      silver; and the avarice of Bessas had labored with so much guilt</a>
<a id='line_649'>      and shame for the benefit of the conqueror. In this revolution,</a>
<a id='line_650'>      the sons and daughters of Roman consuls lasted the misery which</a>
<a id='line_651'>      they had spurned or relieved, wandered in tattered garments</a>
<a id='line_652'>      through the streets of the city and begged their bread, perhaps</a>
<a id='line_653'>      without success, before the gates of their hereditary mansions.</a>
<a id='line_654'>      The riches of Rusticiana, the daughter of Symmachus and widow of</a>
<a id='line_655'>      Boethius, had been generously devoted to alleviate the calamities</a>
<a id='line_656'>      of famine. But the Barbarians were exasperated by the report,</a>
<a id='line_657'>      that she had prompted the people to overthrow the statues of the</a>
<a id='line_658'>      great Theodoric; and the life of that venerable matron would have</a>
<a id='line_659'>      been sacrificed to his memory, if Totila had not respected her</a>
<a id='line_660'>      birth, her virtues, and even the pious motive of her revenge. The</a>
<a id='line_661'>      next day he pronounced two orations, to congratulate and admonish</a>
<a id='line_662'>      his victorious Goths, and to reproach the senate, as the vilest</a>
<a id='line_663'>      of slaves, with their perjury, folly, and ingratitude; sternly</a>
<a id='line_664'>      declaring, that their estates and honors were justly forfeited to</a>
<a id='line_665'>      the companions of his arms. Yet he consented to forgive their</a>
<a id='line_666'>      revolt; and the senators repaid his clemency by despatching</a>
<a id='line_667'>      circular letters to their tenants and vassals in the provinces of</a>
<a id='line_668'>      Italy, strictly to enjoin them to desert the standard of the</a>
<a id='line_669'>      Greeks, to cultivate their lands in peace, and to learn from</a>
<a id='line_670'>      their masters the duty of obedience to a Gothic sovereign.</a>
<a id='line_671'>      Against the city which had so long delayed the course of his</a>
<a id='line_672'>      victories, he appeared inexorable: one third of the walls, in</a>
<a id='line_673'>      different parts, were demolished by his command; fire and engines</a>
<a id='line_674'>      prepared to consume or subvert the most stately works of</a>
<a id='line_675'>      antiquity; and the world was astonished by the fatal decree, that</a>
<a id='line_676'>      Rome should be changed into a pasture for cattle. The firm and</a>
<a id='line_677'>      temperate remonstrance of Belisarius suspended the execution; he</a>
<a id='line_678'>      warned the Barbarian not to sully his fame by the destruction of</a>
<a id='line_679'>      those monuments which were the glory of the dead, and the delight</a>
<a id='line_680'>      of the living; and Totila was persuaded, by the advice of an</a>
<a id='line_681'>      enemy, to preserve Rome as the ornament of his kingdom, or the</a>
<a id='line_682'>      fairest pledge of peace and reconciliation. When he had signified</a>
<a id='line_683'>      to the ambassadors of Belisarius his intention of sparing the</a>
<a id='line_684'>      city, he stationed an army at the distance of one hundred and</a>
<a id='line_685'>      twenty furlongs, to observe the motions of the Roman general.</a>
<a id='line_686'>      With the remainder of his forces he marched into Lucania and</a>
<a id='line_687'>      Apulia, and occupied on the summit of Mount Garganus 14 one of</a>
<a id='line_688'>      the camps of Hannibal. 15 The senators were dragged in his train,</a>
<a id='line_689'>      and afterwards confined in the fortresses of Campania: the</a>
<a id='line_690'>      citizens, with their wives and children, were dispersed in exile;</a>
<a id='line_691'>      and during forty days Rome was abandoned to desolate and dreary</a>

<a id='line_751'>      of Italy. After a long silence, Belisarius was commanded to leave</a>
<a id='line_752'>      a sufficient garrison at Rome, and to transport himself into the</a>
<a id='line_753'>      province of Lucania, whose inhabitants, inflamed by Catholic</a>

<a id='line_755'>      ignoble warfare, the hero, invincible against the power of the</a>
<a id='line_756'>      Barbarians, was basely vanquished by the delay, the disobedience,</a>
<a id='line_757'>      and the cowardice of his own officers. He reposed in his winter</a>
<a id='line_758'>      quarters of Crotona, in the full assurance, that the two passes</a>
<a id='line_759'>      of the Lucanian hills were guarded by his cavalry. They were</a>
<a id='line_760'>      betrayed by treachery or weakness; and the rapid march of the</a>
<a id='line_761'>      Goths scarcely allowed time for the escape of Belisarius to the</a>
<a id='line_762'>      coast of Sicily. At length a fleet and army were assembled for</a>
<a id='line_763'>      the relief of Ruscianum, or Rossano, 18 a fortress sixty furlongs</a>
<a id='line_764'>      from the ruins of Sybaris, where the nobles of Lucania had taken</a>
<a id='line_765'>      refuge. In the first attempt, the Roman forces were dissipated by</a>
<a id='line_766'>      a storm. In the second, they approached the shore; but they saw</a>
<a id='line_767'>      the hills covered with archers, the landing-place defended by a</a>

<a id='line_769'>      The conqueror of Italy retired with a sigh, and continued to</a>
<a id='line_770'>      languish, inglorious and inactive, till Antonina, who had been</a>

<a id='line_790'>      he had wandered like a fugitive along the coast, without daring</a>
<a id='line_791'>      to march into the country, or to accept the bold and repeated</a>

<a id='line_794'>      with the execution, he appeared a more consummate master of the</a>
<a id='line_795'>      art of war, than in the season of his prosperity, when he</a>
<a id='line_796'>      presented two captive kings before the throne of Justinian. The</a>
<a id='line_797'>      valor of Belisarius was not chilled by age: his prudence was</a>
<a id='line_798'>      matured by experience; but the moral virtues of humanity and</a>
<a id='line_799'>      justice seem to have yielded to the hard necessity of the times.</a>

<a id='line_806'>      of the enemy. The avarice of Antonina, which had been some times</a>
<a id='line_807'>      diverted by love, now reigned without a rival in her breast.</a>
<a id='line_808'>      Belisarius himself had always understood, that riches, in a</a>
<a id='line_809'>      corrupt age, are the support and ornament of personal merit. And</a>
<a id='line_810'>      it cannot be presumed that he should stain his honor for the</a>

<a id='line_813'>      Barbarians. But the dagger of conspiracy 19 awaited his return.</a>
<a id='line_814'>      In the midst of wealth and honors, Artaban, who had chastised the</a>
<a id='line_815'>      African tyrant, complained of the ingratitude of courts. He</a>

<a id='line_817'>      her deliverer; but the impediment of his previous marriage was</a>

<a id='line_819'>      irritated by flattery; and the service in which he gloried had</a>
<a id='line_820'>      proved him capable of bold and sanguinary deeds. The death of</a>
<a id='line_821'>      Justinian was resolved, but the conspirators delayed the</a>
<a id='line_822'>      execution till they could surprise Belisarius disarmed, and</a>
<a id='line_823'>      naked, in the palace of Constantinople. Not a hope could be</a>
<a id='line_824'>      entertained of shaking his long-tried fidelity; and they justly</a>
<a id='line_825'>      dreaded the revenge, or rather the justice, of the veteran</a>
<a id='line_826'>      general, who might speedily assemble an army in Thrace to punish</a>

<a id='line_828'>      Delay afforded time for rash communications and honest</a>
<a id='line_829'>      confessions: Artaban and his accomplices were condemned by the</a>

<a id='line_831'>      the gentle confinement of the palace, till he pardoned their</a>
<a id='line_832'>      flagitious attempt against his throne and life. If the emperor</a>

<a id='line_891'>      satisfied, they should instantly accept the tempting offers of</a>

<a id='line_972'>      presumption, that gratitude would animate his valor and fortify</a>
<a id='line_973'>      his allegiance. Belisarius reposed in the shade of his laurels,</a>
<a id='line_974'>      but the command of the principal army was reserved for Germanus,</a>
<a id='line_975'>      26 the emperor’s nephew, whose rank and merit had been long</a>

<a id='line_978'>      and the testament of his brother; and although his conduct was</a>
<a id='line_979'>      pure and blameless, Justinian was displeased that he should be</a>
<a id='line_980'>      thought worthy of the confidence of the malcontent s. The life of</a>
<a id='line_981'>      Germanus was a lesson of implicit obedience: he nobly refused to</a>
<a id='line_982'>      prostitute his name and character in the factions of the circus:</a>
<a id='line_983'>      the gravity of his manners was tempered by innocent cheerfulness;</a>
<a id='line_984'>      and his riches were lent without interest to indigent or</a>
<a id='line_985'>      deserving friends. His valor had formerly triumphed over the</a>
<a id='line_986'>      Sclavonians of the Danube and the rebels of Africa: the first</a>
<a id='line_987'>      report of his promotion revived the hopes of the Italians; and he</a>
<a id='line_988'>      was privately assured, that a crowd of Roman deserters would</a>
<a id='line_989'>      abandon, on his approach, the standard of Totila. His second</a>

<a id='line_996'>      in the promptitude and success of his levies the expectation of</a>
<a id='line_997'>      mankind. He was permitted to select some squadrons of Thracian</a>

<a id='line_999'>      Europe, engaged their voluntary service; and as far as the heart</a>
<a id='line_1000'>      of Germany, his fame and liberality attracted the aid of the</a>
<a id='line_1001'>      Barbarians. 2711 The Romans advanced to Sardica; an army of</a>
<a id='line_1002'>      Sclavonians fled before their march; but within two days of their</a>

<a id='line_1007'>      assaults of Totila Sicily was reduced by the zeal of Artaban, and</a>

<a id='line_1050'>      studied in the palace to dissemble, to flatter, and to persuade;</a>

<a id='line_1179'>      offer, not of peace, but of pardon. The answer of the Gothic king</a>
<a id='line_1180'>      declared his resolution to die or conquer. “What day,” said the</a>
<a id='line_1181'>      messenger, “will you fix for the combat?” “The eighth day,”</a>
<a id='line_1182'>      replied Totila; but early the next morning he attempted to</a>
<a id='line_1183'>      surprise a foe, suspicious of deceit, and prepared for battle.</a>
<a id='line_1184'>      Ten thousand Heruli and Lombards, of approved valor and doubtful</a>
<a id='line_1185'>      faith, were placed in the centre. Each of the wings was composed</a>
<a id='line_1186'>      of eight thousand Romans; the right was guarded by the cavalry of</a>
<a id='line_1187'>      the Huns, the left was covered by fifteen hundred chosen horse,</a>
<a id='line_1188'>      destined, according to the emergencies of action, to sustain the</a>
<a id='line_1189'>      retreat of their friends, or to encompass the flank of the enemy.</a>
<a id='line_1190'>      From his proper station at the head of the right wing, the eunuch</a>
<a id='line_1191'>      rode along the line, expressing by his voice and countenance the</a>
<a id='line_1192'>      assurance of victory; exciting the soldiers of the emperor to</a>
<a id='line_1193'>      punish the guilt and madness of a band of robbers; and exposing</a>
<a id='line_1194'>      to their view gold chains, collars, and bracelets, the rewards of</a>
<a id='line_1195'>      military virtue. From the event of a single combat they drew an</a>
<a id='line_1196'>      omen of success; and they beheld with pleasure the courage of</a>
<a id='line_1197'>      fifty archers, who maintained a small eminence against three</a>
<a id='line_1198'>      successive attacks of the Gothic cavalry. At the distance only of</a>
<a id='line_1199'>      two bow-shots, the armies spent the morning in dreadful suspense,</a>
<a id='line_1200'>      and the Romans tasted some necessary food, without unloosing the</a>
<a id='line_1201'>      cuirass from their breast, or the bridle from their horses.</a>
<a id='line_1202'>      Narses awaited the charge; and it was delayed by Totila till he</a>
<a id='line_1203'>      had received his last succors of two thousand Goths. While he</a>
<a id='line_1204'>      consumed the hours in fruitless treaty, the king exhibited in a</a>
<a id='line_1205'>      narrow space the strength and agility of a warrior. His armor was</a>
<a id='line_1206'>      enchased with gold; his purple banner floated with the wind: he</a>
<a id='line_1207'>      cast his lance into the air; caught it with the right hand;</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      shifted it to the left; threw himself backwards; recovered his</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      seat; and managed a fiery steed in all the paces and evolutions</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      of the equestrian school. As soon as the succors had arrived, he</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      retired to his tent, assumed the dress and arms of a private</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      soldier, and gave the signal of a battle. The first line of</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      cavalry advanced with more courage than discretion, and left</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      behind them the infantry of the second line. They were soon</a>
<a id='line_1215'>      engaged between the horns of a crescent, into which the adverse</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      wings had been insensibly curved, and were saluted from either</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      side by the volleys of four thousand archers. Their ardor, and</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      even their distress, drove them forwards to a close and unequal</a>
<a id='line_1219'>      conflict, in which they could only use their lances against an</a>
<a id='line_1220'>      enemy equally skilled in all the instruments of war. A generous</a>
<a id='line_1221'>      emulation inspired the Romans and their Barbarian allies; and</a>
<a id='line_1222'>      Narses, who calmly viewed and directed their efforts, doubted to</a>
<a id='line_1223'>      whom he should adjudge the prize of superior bravery. The Gothic</a>
<a id='line_1224'>      cavalry was astonished and disordered, pressed and broken; and</a>
<a id='line_1225'>      the line of infantry, instead of presenting their spears, or</a>
<a id='line_1226'>      opening their intervals, were trampled under the feet of the</a>
<a id='line_1227'>      flying horse. Six thousand of the Goths were slaughtered without</a>
<a id='line_1228'>      mercy in the field of Tagina. Their prince, with five attendants,</a>
<a id='line_1229'>      was overtaken by Asbad, of the race of the Gepidae. “Spare the</a>
<a id='line_1230'>      king of Italy,” 3611 cried a loyal voice, and Asbad struck his</a>
<a id='line_1231'>      lance through the body of Totila. The blow was instantly revenged</a>
<a id='line_1232'>      by the faithful Goths: they transported their dying monarch seven</a>

<a id='line_1357'>      left: with the one he struck dead the foremost of the assailants;</a>

<a id='line_1363'>      a fresh buckler; but in the moment while his side was uncovered,</a>
<a id='line_1364'>      it was pierced by a mortal dart. He fell; and his head, exalted</a>

<a id='line_1369'>      The combat was renewed with the return of light, and maintained</a>

<a id='line_1471'>      the right wing, Buccelin assumed the spoil of Campania, Lucania,</a>
<a id='line_1472'>      and Bruttium; with the left, Lothaire accepted the plunder of</a>

<a id='line_1475'>      lands of Italy were the term of their destructive progress. The</a>
<a id='line_1476'>      Franks, who were Christians and Catholics, contented themselves</a>
<a id='line_1477'>      with simple pillage and occasional murder. But the churches which</a>

<a id='line_1518'>      men, in the neighborhood of Rome. Their winter hours had not been</a>
<a id='line_1519'>      consumed in idleness. By the command, and after the example, of</a>
<a id='line_1520'>      Narses, they repeated each day their military exercise on foot</a>

<a id='line_1527'>      by a rampart of sharp stakes, and a circle of wagons, whose</a>
<a id='line_1528'>      wheels were buried in the earth. He impatiently expected the</a>
<a id='line_1529'>      return of Lothaire; ignorant, alas! that his brother could never</a>

<a id='line_1531'>      strange disease 50 on the banks of the Lake Benacus, between</a>
<a id='line_1532'>      Trent and Verona. The banners of Narses soon approached the</a>
<a id='line_1533'>      Vulturnus, and the eyes of Italy were anxiously fixed on the</a>
<a id='line_1534'>      event of this final contest. Perhaps the talents of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1535'>      general were most conspicuous in the calm operations which</a>
<a id='line_1536'>      precede the tumult of a battle. His skilful movements intercepted</a>
<a id='line_1537'>      the subsistence of the Barbarian, deprived him of the advantage</a>
<a id='line_1538'>      of the bridge and river, and in the choice of the ground and</a>
<a id='line_1539'>      moment of action reduced him to comply with the inclination of</a>
<a id='line_1540'>      his enemy. On the morning of the important day, when the ranks</a>
<a id='line_1541'>      were already formed, a servant, for some trivial fault, was</a>
<a id='line_1542'>      killed by his master, one of the leaders of the Heruli. The</a>
<a id='line_1543'>      justice or passion of Narses was awakened: he summoned the</a>
<a id='line_1544'>      offender to his presence, and without listening to his excuses,</a>
<a id='line_1545'>      gave the signal to the minister of death. If the cruel master had</a>
<a id='line_1546'>      not infringed the laws of his nation, this arbitrary execution</a>
<a id='line_1547'>      was not less unjust than it appears to have been imprudent. The</a>
<a id='line_1548'>      Heruli felt the indignity; they halted: but the Roman general,</a>
<a id='line_1549'>      without soothing their rage, or expecting their resolution,</a>
<a id='line_1550'>      called aloud, as the trumpets sounded, that unless they hastened</a>
<a id='line_1551'>      to occupy their place, they would lose the honor of the victory.</a>
<a id='line_1552'>      His troops were disposed 51 in a long front, the cavalry on the</a>
<a id='line_1553'>      wings; in the centre, the heavy-armed foot; the archers and</a>
<a id='line_1554'>      slingers in the rear. The Germans advanced in a sharp-pointed</a>
<a id='line_1555'>      column, of the form of a triangle or solid wedge. They pierced</a>
<a id='line_1556'>      the feeble centre of Narses, who received them with a smile into</a>
<a id='line_1557'>      the fatal snare, and directed his wings of cavalry insensibly to</a>
<a id='line_1558'>      wheel on their flanks and encompass their rear. The host of the</a>
<a id='line_1559'>      Franks and Alamanni consisted of infantry: a sword and buckler</a>
<a id='line_1560'>      hung by their side; and they used, as their weapons of offence, a</a>
<a id='line_1561'>      weighty hatchet and a hooked javelin, which were only formidable</a>
<a id='line_1562'>      in close combat, or at a short distance. The flower of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_1563'>      archers, on horseback, and in complete armor, skirmished without</a>
<a id='line_1564'>      peril round this immovable phalanx; supplied by active speed the</a>
<a id='line_1565'>      deficiency of number; and aimed their arrows against a crowd of</a>
<a id='line_1566'>      Barbarians, who, instead of a cuirass and helmet, were covered by</a>
<a id='line_1567'>      a loose garment of fur or linen. They paused, they trembled,</a>
<a id='line_1568'>      their ranks were confounded, and in the decisive moment the</a>
<a id='line_1569'>      Heruli, preferring glory to revenge, charged with rapid violence</a>
<a id='line_1570'>      the head of the column. Their leader, Sinbal, and Aligern, the</a>
<a id='line_1571'>      Gothic prince, deserved the prize of superior valor; and their</a>
<a id='line_1572'>      example excited the victorious troops to achieve with swords and</a>
<a id='line_1573'>      spears the destruction of the enemy. Buccelin, and the greatest</a>
<a id='line_1574'>      part of his army, perished on the field of battle, in the waters</a>
<a id='line_1575'>      of the Vulturnus, or by the hands of the enraged peasants: but it</a>
<a id='line_1576'>      may seem incredible, that a victory, 52 which no more than five</a>

<a id='line_1613'>      reduced to the limits of a narrow province: but Narses himself,</a>
<a id='line_1614'>      the first and most powerful of the exarchs, administered above</a>
<a id='line_1615'>      fifteen years the entire kingdom of Italy. Like Belisarius, he</a>
<a id='line_1616'>      had deserved the honors of envy, calumny, and disgrace: but the</a>
<a id='line_1617'>      favorite eunuch still enjoyed the confidence of Justinian; or the</a>

<a id='line_1619'>      a timid court. Yet it was not by weak and mischievous indulgence</a>
<a id='line_1620'>      that Narses secured the attachment of his troops. Forgetful of</a>
<a id='line_1621'>      the past, and regardless of the future, they abused the present</a>
<a id='line_1622'>      hour of prosperity and peace. The cities of Italy resounded with</a>
<a id='line_1623'>      the noise of drinking and dancing; the spoils of victory were</a>
<a id='line_1624'>      wasted in sensual pleasures; and nothing (says Agathias) remained</a>
<a id='line_1625'>      unless to exchange their shields and helmets for the soft lute</a>
<a id='line_1626'>      and the capacious hogshead. 54 In a manly oration, not unworthy</a>
<a id='line_1627'>      of a Roman censor, the eunuch reproved these disorderly vices,</a>
<a id='line_1628'>      which sullied their fame, and endangered their safety. The</a>
<a id='line_1629'>      soldiers blushed and obeyed; discipline was confirmed; the</a>
<a id='line_1630'>      fortifications were restored; a duke was stationed for the</a>
<a id='line_1631'>      defence and military command of each of the principal cities; 55</a>
<a id='line_1632'>      and the eye of Narses pervaded the ample prospect from Calabria</a>
<a id='line_1633'>      to the Alps. The remains of the Gothic nation evacuated the</a>
<a id='line_1634'>      country, or mingled with the people; the Franks, instead of</a>
<a id='line_1635'>      revenging the death of Buccelin, abandoned, without a struggle,</a>
<a id='line_1636'>      their Italian conquests; and the rebellious Sinbal, chief of the</a>
<a id='line_1637'>      Heruli, was subdued, taken and hung on a lofty gallows by the</a>
<a id='line_1638'>      inflexible justice of the exarch. 56 The civil state of Italy,</a>
<a id='line_1639'>      after the agitation of a long tempest, was fixed by a pragmatic</a>
<a id='line_1640'>      sanction, which the emperor promulgated at the request of the</a>
<a id='line_1641'>      pope. Justinian introduced his own jurisprudence into the schools</a>
<a id='line_1642'>      and tribunals of the West; he ratified the acts of Theodoric and</a>
<a id='line_1643'>      his immediate successors, but every deed was rescinded and</a>
<a id='line_1644'>      abolished which force had extorted, or fear had subscribed, under</a>
<a id='line_1645'>      the usurpation of Totila. A moderate theory was framed to</a>
<a id='line_1646'>      reconcile the rights of property with the safety of prescription,</a>
<a id='line_1647'>      the claims of the state with the poverty of the people, and the</a>
<a id='line_1648'>      pardon of offences with the interest of virtue and order of</a>
<a id='line_1649'>      society. Under the exarchs of Ravenna, Rome was degraded to the</a>
<a id='line_1650'>      second rank. Yet the senators were gratified by the permission of</a>
<a id='line_1651'>      visiting their estates in Italy, and of approaching, without</a>
<a id='line_1652'>      obstacle, the throne of Constantinople: the regulation of weights</a>
<a id='line_1653'>      and measures was delegated to the pope and senate; and the</a>
<a id='line_1654'>      salaries of lawyers and physicians, of orators and grammarians,</a>
<a id='line_1655'>      were destined to preserve, or rekindle, the light of science in</a>
<a id='line_1656'>      the ancient capital. Justinian might dictate benevolent edicts,</a>
<a id='line_1657'>      57 and Narses might second his wishes by the restoration of</a>
<a id='line_1658'>      cities, and more especially of churches. But the power of kings</a>
<a id='line_1659'>      is most effectual to destroy; and the twenty years of the Gothic</a>

<a id='line_1712'>      consciousness of his own exploits might teach him to esteem</a>
<a id='line_1713'>      without jealousy the merit of a rival; and the repose of the aged</a>
<a id='line_1714'>      warrior was crowned by a last victory, which saved the emperor</a>
<a id='line_1715'>      and the capital. The Barbarians, who annually visited the</a>
<a id='line_1716'>      provinces of Europe, were less discouraged by some accidental</a>
<a id='line_1717'>      defeats, than they were excited by the double hope of spoil and</a>
<a id='line_1718'>      of subsidy. In the thirty-second winter of Justinian’s reign, the</a>
<a id='line_1719'>      Danube was deeply frozen: Zabergan led the cavalry of the</a>
<a id='line_1720'>      Bulgarians, and his standard was followed by a promiscuous</a>
<a id='line_1721'>      multitude of Sclavonians. 6011 The savage chief passed, without</a>
<a id='line_1722'>      opposition, the river and the mountains, spread his troops over</a>
<a id='line_1723'>      Macedonia and Thrace, and advanced with no more than seven</a>
<a id='line_1724'>      thousand horse to the long wall, which should have defended the</a>
<a id='line_1725'>      territory of Constantinople. But the works of man are impotent</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      against the assaults of nature: a recent earthquake had shaken</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      the foundations of the wall; and the forces of the empire were</a>
<a id='line_1728'>      employed on the distant frontiers of Italy, Africa, and Persia.</a>
<a id='line_1729'>      The seven schools, 61 or companies of the guards or domestic</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      troops, had been augmented to the number of five thousand five</a>

<a id='line_1732'>      Asia. But the places of the brave Armenians were insensibly</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      supplied by lazy citizens, who purchased an exemption from the</a>

<a id='line_1805'>      of their danger, accompanied his triumph with acclamations of joy</a>
<a id='line_1806'>      and gratitude, which were imputed as a crime to the victorious</a>

<a id='line_1808'>      silent, and the emperor, after a cold and thankless embrace,</a>
<a id='line_1809'>      dismissed him to mingle with the train of slaves. Yet so deep was</a>

<a id='line_1833'></a>
<a id='line_1834'>      About two years after the last victory of Belisarius, the emperor</a>
<a id='line_1835'>      returned from a Thracian journey of health, or business, or</a>
<a id='line_1836'>      devotion. Justinian was afflicted by a pain in his head; and his</a>
<a id='line_1837'>      private entry countenanced the rumor of his death. Before the</a>
<a id='line_1838'>      third hour of the day, the bakers’ shops were plundered of their</a>
<a id='line_1839'>      bread, the houses were shut, and every citizen, with hope or</a>
<a id='line_1840'>      terror, prepared for the impending tumult. The senators</a>
<a id='line_1841'>      themselves, fearful and suspicious, were convened at the ninth</a>
<a id='line_1842'>      hour; and the praefect received their commands to visit every</a>
<a id='line_1843'>      quarter of the city, and proclaim a general illumination for the</a>
<a id='line_1844'>      recovery of the emperor’s health. The ferment subsided; but every</a>
<a id='line_1845'>      accident betrayed the impotence of the government, and the</a>
<a id='line_1846'>      factious temper of the people: the guards were disposed to mutiny</a>
<a id='line_1847'>      as often as their quarters were changed, or their pay was</a>
<a id='line_1848'>      withheld: the frequent calamities of fires and earthquakes</a>
<a id='line_1849'>      afforded the opportunities of disorder; the disputes of the blues</a>
<a id='line_1850'>      and greens, of the orthodox and heretics, degenerated into bloody</a>
<a id='line_1851'>      battles; and, in the presence of the Persian ambassador,</a>
<a id='line_1852'>      Justinian blushed for himself and for his subjects. Capricious</a>
<a id='line_1853'>      pardon and arbitrary punishment imbittered the irksomeness and</a>
<a id='line_1854'>      discontent of a long reign: a conspiracy was formed in the</a>
<a id='line_1855'>      palace; and, unless we are deceived by the names of Marcellus and</a>
<a id='line_1856'>      Sergius, the most virtuous and the most profligate of the</a>
<a id='line_1857'>      courtiers were associated in the same designs. They had fixed the</a>
<a id='line_1858'>      time of the execution; their rank gave them access to the royal</a>
<a id='line_1859'>      banquet; and their black slaves 65 were stationed in the</a>
<a id='line_1860'>      vestibule and porticos, to announce the death of the tyrant, and</a>
<a id='line_1861'>      to excite a sedition in the capital. But the indiscretion of an</a>
<a id='line_1862'>      accomplice saved the poor remnant of the days of Justinian. The</a>
<a id='line_1863'>      conspirators were detected and seized, with daggers hidden under</a>
<a id='line_1864'>      their garments: Marcellus died by his own hand, and Sergius was</a>
<a id='line_1865'>      dragged from the sanctuary. 66 Pressed by remorse, or tempted by</a>
<a id='line_1866'>      the hopes of safety, he accused two officers of the household of</a>
<a id='line_1867'>      Belisarius; and torture forced them to declare that they had</a>
<a id='line_1868'>      acted according to the secret instructions of their patron. 67</a>
<a id='line_1869'>      Posterity will not hastily believe that a hero who, in the vigor</a>
<a id='line_1870'>      of life, had disdained the fairest offers of ambition and</a>
<a id='line_1871'>      revenge, should stoop to the murder of his prince, whom he could</a>
<a id='line_1872'>      not long expect to survive. His followers were impatient to fly;</a>
<a id='line_1873'>      but flight must have been supported by rebellion, and he had</a>
<a id='line_1874'>      lived enough for nature and for glory. Belisarius appeared before</a>
<a id='line_1875'>      the council with less fear than indignation: after forty years’</a>
<a id='line_1876'>      service, the emperor had prejudged his guilt; and injustice was</a>
<a id='line_1877'>      sanctified by the presence and authority of the patriarch. The</a>
<a id='line_1878'>      life of Belisarius was graciously spared; but his fortunes were</a>
<a id='line_1879'>      sequestered, and, from December to July, he was guarded as a</a>
<a id='line_1880'>      prisoner in his own palace. At length his innocence was</a>
<a id='line_1881'>      acknowledged; his freedom and honor were restored; and death,</a>
<a id='line_1882'>      which might be hastened by resentment and grief, removed him from</a>
<a id='line_1883'>      the world in about eight months after his deliverance. The name</a>
<a id='line_1884'>      of Belisarius can never die but instead of the funeral, the</a>

<a id='line_1958'>      If the emperor could rejoice in the death of Belisarius, he</a>
<a id='line_1959'>      enjoyed the base satisfaction only eight months, the last period</a>
<a id='line_1960'>      of a reign of thirty-eight years, and a life of eighty-three</a>
<a id='line_1961'>      years. It would be difficult to trace the character of a prince</a>
<a id='line_1962'>      who is not the most conspicuous object of his own times: but the</a>
<a id='line_1963'>      confessions of an enemy may be received as the safest evidence of</a>
<a id='line_1964'>      his virtues. The resemblance of Justinian to the bust of</a>
<a id='line_1965'>      Domitian, is maliciously urged; 71 with the acknowledgment,</a>
<a id='line_1966'>      however, of a well-proportioned figure, a ruddy complexion, and a</a>
<a id='line_1967'>      pleasing countenance. The emperor was easy of access, patient of</a>
<a id='line_1968'>      hearing, courteous and affable in discourse, and a master of the</a>
<a id='line_1969'>      angry passions which rage with such destructive violence in the</a>
<a id='line_1970'>      breast of a despot. Procopius praises his temper, to reproach him</a>
<a id='line_1971'>      with calm and deliberate cruelty: but in the conspiracies which</a>
<a id='line_1972'>      attacked his authority and person, a more candid judge will</a>
<a id='line_1973'>      approve the justice, or admire the clemency, of Justinian. He</a>
<a id='line_1974'>      excelled in the private virtues of chastity and temperance: but</a>
<a id='line_1975'>      the impartial love of beauty would have been less mischievous</a>
<a id='line_1976'>      than his conjugal tenderness for Theodora; and his abstemious</a>
<a id='line_1977'>      diet was regulated, not by the prudence of a philosopher, but the</a>
<a id='line_1978'>      superstition of a monk. His repasts were short and frugal: on</a>
<a id='line_1979'>      solemn fasts, he contented himself with water and vegetables; and</a>
<a id='line_1980'>      such was his strength, as well as fervor, that he frequently</a>
<a id='line_1981'>      passed two days, and as many nights, without tasting any food.</a>
<a id='line_1982'>      The measure of his sleep was not less rigorous: after the repose</a>
<a id='line_1983'>      of a single hour, the body was awakened by the soul, and, to the</a>
<a id='line_1984'>      astonishment of his chamberlain, Justinian walked or studied till</a>
<a id='line_1985'>      the morning light. Such restless application prolonged his time</a>
<a id='line_1986'>      for the acquisition of knowledge 72 and the despatch of business;</a>
<a id='line_1987'>      and he might seriously deserve the reproach of confounding, by</a>
<a id='line_1988'>      minute and preposterous diligence, the general order of his</a>
<a id='line_1989'>      administration. The emperor professed himself a musician and</a>
<a id='line_1990'>      architect, a poet and philosopher, a lawyer and theologian; and</a>
<a id='line_1991'>      if he failed in the enterprise of reconciling the Christian</a>
<a id='line_1992'>      sects, the review of the Roman jurisprudence is a noble monument</a>
<a id='line_1993'>      of his spirit and industry. In the government of the empire, he</a>
<a id='line_1994'>      was less wise, or less successful: the age was unfortunate; the</a>
<a id='line_1995'>      people was oppressed and discontented; Theodora abused her power;</a>
<a id='line_1996'>      a succession of bad ministers disgraced his judgment; and</a>
<a id='line_1997'>      Justinian was neither beloved in his life, nor regretted at his</a>
<a id='line_1998'>      death. The love of fame was deeply implanted in his breast, but</a>
<a id='line_1999'>      he condescended to the poor ambition of titles, honors, and</a>
<a id='line_2000'>      contemporary praise; and while he labored to fix the admiration,</a>
<a id='line_2001'>      he forfeited the esteem and affection, of the Romans.</a>
<a id='line_2002'></a>
<a id='line_2003'>      The design of the African and Italian wars was boldly conceived</a>
<a id='line_2004'>      and executed; and his penetration discovered the talents of</a>
<a id='line_2005'>      Belisarius in the camp, of Narses in the palace. But the name of</a>
<a id='line_2006'>      the emperor is eclipsed by the names of his victorious generals;</a>
<a id='line_2007'>      and Belisarius still lives, to upbraid the envy and ingratitude</a>
<a id='line_2008'>      of his sovereign. The partial favor of mankind applauds the</a>
<a id='line_2009'>      genius of a conqueror, who leads and directs his subjects in the</a>
<a id='line_2010'>      exercise of arms. The characters of Philip the Second and of</a>

<a id='line_2043'>      and the plague, which astonished or afflicted the age of</a>
<a id='line_2044'>      Justinian. I. In the fifth year of his reign, and in the month of</a>
<a id='line_2045'>      September, a comet 74 was seen during twenty days in the western</a>
<a id='line_2046'>      quarter of the heavens, and which shot its rays into the north.</a>
<a id='line_2047'>      Eight years afterwards, while the sun was in Capricorn, another</a>
<a id='line_2048'>      comet appeared to follow in the Sagittary; the size was gradually</a>
<a id='line_2049'>      increasing; the head was in the east, the tail in the west, and</a>
<a id='line_2050'>      it remained visible above forty days. The nations, who gazed with</a>
<a id='line_2051'>      astonishment, expected wars and calamities from their baleful</a>
<a id='line_2052'>      influence; and these expectations were abundantly fulfilled. The</a>
<a id='line_2053'>      astronomers dissembled their ignorance of the nature of these</a>
<a id='line_2054'>      blazing stars, which they affected to represent as the floating</a>
<a id='line_2055'>      meteors of the air; and few among them embraced the simple notion</a>
<a id='line_2056'>      of Seneca and the Chaldeans, that they are only planets of a</a>
<a id='line_2057'>      longer period and more eccentric motion. 75 Time and science have</a>
<a id='line_2058'>      justified the conjectures and predictions of the Roman sage: the</a>
<a id='line_2059'>      telescope has opened new worlds to the eyes of astronomers; 76</a>
<a id='line_2060'>      and, in the narrow space of history and fable, one and the same</a>
<a id='line_2061'>      comet is already found to have revisited the earth in seven equal</a>
<a id='line_2062'>      revolutions of five hundred and seventy-five years. The first, 77</a>
<a id='line_2063'>      which ascends beyond the Christian aera one thousand seven</a>
<a id='line_2064'>      hundred and sixty-seven years, is coeval with Ogyges, the father</a>
<a id='line_2065'>      of Grecian antiquity. And this appearance explains the tradition</a>
<a id='line_2066'>      which Varro has preserved, that under his reign the planet Venus</a>
<a id='line_2067'>      changed her color, size, figure, and course; a prodigy without</a>
<a id='line_2068'>      example either in past or succeeding ages. 78 The second visit,</a>
<a id='line_2069'>      in the year eleven hundred and ninety-three, is darkly implied in</a>
<a id='line_2070'>      the fable of Electra, the seventh of the Pleiads, who have been</a>
<a id='line_2071'>      reduced to six since the time of the Trojan war. That nymph, the</a>
<a id='line_2072'>      wife of Dardanus, was unable to support the ruin of her country:</a>
<a id='line_2073'>      she abandoned the dances of her sister orbs, fled from the zodiac</a>
<a id='line_2074'>      to the north pole, and obtained, from her dishevelled locks, the</a>
<a id='line_2075'>      name of the comet. The third period expires in the year six</a>
<a id='line_2076'>      hundred and eighteen, a date that exactly agrees with the</a>
<a id='line_2077'>      tremendous comet of the Sibyl, and perhaps of Pliny, which arose</a>
<a id='line_2078'>      in the West two generations before the reign of Cyrus. The fourth</a>
<a id='line_2079'>      apparition, forty-four years before the birth of Christ, is of</a>
<a id='line_2080'>      all others the most splendid and important. After the death of</a>
<a id='line_2081'>      Caesar, a long-haired star was conspicuous to Rome and to the</a>
<a id='line_2082'>      nations, during the games which were exhibited by young Octavian</a>
<a id='line_2083'>      in honor of Venus and his uncle. The vulgar opinion, that it</a>
<a id='line_2084'>      conveyed to heaven the divine soul of the dictator, was cherished</a>
<a id='line_2085'>      and consecrated by the piety of a statesman; while his secret</a>
<a id='line_2086'>      superstition referred the comet to the glory of his own times. 79</a>
<a id='line_2087'>      The fifth visit has been already ascribed to the fifth year of</a>
<a id='line_2088'>      Justinian, which coincides with the five hundred and thirty-first</a>
<a id='line_2089'>      of the Christian aera. And it may deserve notice, that in this,</a>
<a id='line_2090'>      as in the preceding instance, the comet was followed, though at a</a>
<a id='line_2091'>      longer interval, by a remarkable paleness of the sun. The sixth</a>
<a id='line_2092'>      return, in the year eleven hundred and six, is recorded by the</a>
<a id='line_2093'>      chronicles of Europe and China: and in the first fervor of the</a>
<a id='line_2094'>      crusades, the Christians and the Mahometans might surmise, with</a>
<a id='line_2095'>      equal reason, that it portended the destruction of the Infidels.</a>
<a id='line_2096'>      The seventh phenomenon, of one thousand six hundred and eighty,</a>
<a id='line_2097'>      was presented to the eyes of an enlightened age. 80 The</a>

<a id='line_2099'>      so recently adorned, that the comet, “from its horrid hair shakes</a>

<a id='line_2101'>      exquisite skill by Flamstead and Cassini: and the mathematical</a>
<a id='line_2102'>      science of Bernoulli, Newton 8111, and Halley, investigated the</a>

<a id='line_2194'>      which include a nation within the limits of a wall, almost</a>
<a id='line_2195'>      realizes the wish of Caligula, that the Roman people had but one</a>

<a id='line_2198'>      were swelled by the conflux of strangers to the festival of the</a>
<a id='line_2199'>      Ascension. The loss of Berytus 86 was of smaller account, but of</a>
<a id='line_2200'>      much greater value. That city, on the coast of Phoenicia, was</a>
<a id='line_2201'>      illustrated by the study of the civil law, which opened the</a>
<a id='line_2202'>      surest road to wealth and dignity: the schools of Berytus were</a>
<a id='line_2203'>      filled with the rising spirits of the age, and many a youth was</a>

<a id='line_2206'>      becomes the enemy of mankind. The hut of a savage, or the tent of</a>
<a id='line_2207'>      an Arab, may be thrown down without injury to the inhabitant; and</a>
<a id='line_2208'>      the Peruvians had reason to deride the folly of their Spanish</a>
<a id='line_2209'>      conquerors, who with so much cost and labor erected their own</a>

<a id='line_2211'>      head: a whole people is buried under the ruins of public and</a>

<a id='line_2274'>      Athens. 90 The infection was sometimes announced by the visions</a>
<a id='line_2275'>      of a distempered fancy, and the victim despaired as soon as he</a>
<a id='line_2276'>      had heard the menace and felt the stroke of an invisible spectre.</a>
<a id='line_2277'>      But the greater number, in their beds, in the streets, in their</a>

<a id='line_2280'>      any signs of the approaching danger. The same, the next, or the</a>
<a id='line_2281'>      succeeding day, it was declared by the swelling of the glands,</a>
<a id='line_2282'>      particularly those of the groin, of the armpits, and under the</a>
<a id='line_2283'>      ear; and when these buboes or tumors were opened, they were found</a>
<a id='line_2284'>      to contain a coal, or black substance, of the size of a lentil.</a>
<a id='line_2285'>      If they came to a just swelling and suppuration, the patient was</a>

<a id='line_2287'>      if they continued hard and dry, a mortification quickly ensued,</a>
<a id='line_2288'>      and the fifth day was commonly the term of his life. The fever</a>
<a id='line_2289'>      was often accompanied with lethargy or delirium; the bodies of</a>
<a id='line_2290'>      the sick were covered with black pustules or carbuncles, the</a>
<a id='line_2291'>      symptoms of immediate death; and in the constitutions too feeble</a>
<a id='line_2292'>      to produce an irruption, the vomiting of blood was followed by a</a>
<a id='line_2293'>      mortification of the bowels. To pregnant women the plague was</a>
<a id='line_2294'>      generally mortal: yet one infant was drawn alive from his dead</a>
<a id='line_2295'>      mother, and three mothers survived the loss of their infected</a>
<a id='line_2296'>      foetus. Youth was the most perilous season; and the female sex</a>
<a id='line_2297'>      was less susceptible than the male: but every rank and profession</a>
<a id='line_2298'>      was attacked with indiscriminate rage, and many of those who</a>
<a id='line_2299'>      escaped were deprived of the use of their speech, without being</a>
<a id='line_2300'>      secure from a return of the disorder. 91 The physicians of</a>
<a id='line_2301'>      Constantinople were zealous and skilful; but their art was</a>
<a id='line_2302'>      baffled by the various symptoms and pertinacious vehemence of the</a>
<a id='line_2303'>      disease: the same remedies were productive of contrary effects,</a>
<a id='line_2304'>      and the event capriciously disappointed their prognostics of</a>
<a id='line_2305'>      death or recovery. The order of funerals, and the right of</a>
<a id='line_2306'>      sepulchres, were confounded: those who were left without friends</a>
<a id='line_2307'>      or servants, lay unburied in the streets, or in their desolate</a>
<a id='line_2308'>      houses; and a magistrate was authorized to collect the</a>
<a id='line_2309'>      promiscuous heaps of dead bodies, to transport them by land or</a>
<a id='line_2310'>      water, and to inter them in deep pits beyond the precincts of the</a>
