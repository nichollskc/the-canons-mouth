<a id='line_1'>      Venetians.—Part I.</a>

<a id='line_7'>     Consequences Of The Crusades.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>      After the death of the lawful princes, the French and Venetians,</a>
<a id='line_10'>      confident of justice and victory, agreed to divide and regulate</a>
<a id='line_11'>      their future possessions. 1 It was stipulated by treaty, that</a>
<a id='line_12'>      twelve electors, six of either nation, should be nominated; that</a>
<a id='line_13'>      a majority should choose the emperor of the East; and that, if</a>
<a id='line_14'>      the votes were equal, the decision of chance should ascertain the</a>
<a id='line_15'>      successful candidate. To him, with all the titles and</a>
<a id='line_16'>      prerogatives of the Byzantine throne, they assigned the two</a>
<a id='line_17'>      palaces of Boucoleon and Blachernæ, with a fourth part of the</a>
<a id='line_18'>      Greek monarchy. It was defined that the three remaining portions</a>
<a id='line_19'>      should be equally shared between the republic of Venice and the</a>
<a id='line_20'>      barons of France; that each feudatory, with an honorable</a>
<a id='line_21'>      exception for the doge, should acknowledge and perform the duties</a>
<a id='line_22'>      of homage and military service to the supreme head of the empire;</a>
<a id='line_23'>      that the nation which gave an emperor, should resign to their</a>
<a id='line_24'>      brethren the choice of a patriarch; and that the pilgrims,</a>
<a id='line_25'>      whatever might be their impatience to visit the Holy Land, should</a>
<a id='line_26'>      devote another year to the conquest and defence of the Greek</a>
<a id='line_27'>      provinces. After the conquest of Constantinople by the Latins,</a>
<a id='line_28'>      the treaty was confirmed and executed; and the first and most</a>
<a id='line_29'>      important step was the creation of an emperor. The six electors</a>
<a id='line_30'>      of the French nation were all ecclesiastics, the abbot of Loces,</a>
<a id='line_31'>      the archbishop elect of Acre in Palestine, and the bishops of</a>
<a id='line_32'>      Troyes, Soissons, Halberstadt, and Bethlehem, the last of whom</a>
<a id='line_33'>      exercised in the camp the office of pope’s legate: their</a>
<a id='line_34'>      profession and knowledge were respectable; and as _they_ could</a>
<a id='line_35'>      not be the objects, they were best qualified to be the authors of</a>
<a id='line_36'>      the choice. The six Venetians were the principal servants of the</a>
<a id='line_37'>      state, and in this list the noble families of Querini and</a>
<a id='line_38'>      Contarini are still proud to discover their ancestors. The twelve</a>
<a id='line_39'>      assembled in the chapel of the palace; and after the solemn</a>
<a id='line_40'>      invocation of the Holy Ghost, they proceeded to deliberate and</a>
<a id='line_41'>      vote. A just impulse of respect and gratitude prompted them to</a>
<a id='line_42'>      crown the virtues of the doge; his wisdom had inspired their</a>
<a id='line_43'>      enterprise; and the most youthful knights might envy and applaud</a>
<a id='line_44'>      the exploits of blindness and age. But the patriot Dandolo was</a>
<a id='line_45'>      devoid of all personal ambition, and fully satisfied that he had</a>
<a id='line_46'>      been judged worthy to reign. His nomination was overruled by the</a>
<a id='line_47'>      Venetians themselves: his countrymen, and perhaps his friends, 2</a>
<a id='line_48'>      represented, with the eloquence of truth, the mischiefs that</a>
<a id='line_49'>      might arise to national freedom and the common cause, from the</a>
<a id='line_50'>      union of two incompatible characters, of the first magistrate of</a>
<a id='line_51'>      a republic and the emperor of the East. The exclusion of the doge</a>
<a id='line_52'>      left room for the more equal merits of Boniface and Baldwin; and</a>
<a id='line_53'>      at their names all meaner candidates respectfully withdrew. The</a>
<a id='line_54'>      marquis of Montferrat was recommended by his mature age and fair</a>
<a id='line_55'>      reputation, by the choice of the adventurers, and the wishes of</a>
<a id='line_56'>      the Greeks; nor can I believe that Venice, the mistress of the</a>
<a id='line_57'>      sea, could be seriously apprehensive of a petty lord at the foot</a>
<a id='line_58'>      of the Alps. 3 But the count of Flanders was the chief of a</a>
<a id='line_59'>      wealthy and warlike people: he was valiant, pious, and chaste; in</a>
<a id='line_60'>      the prime of life, since he was only thirty-two years of age; a</a>
<a id='line_61'>      descendant of Charlemagne, a cousin of the king of France, and a</a>
<a id='line_62'>      compeer of the prelates and barons who had yielded with</a>
<a id='line_63'>      reluctance to the command of a foreigner. Without the chapel,</a>
<a id='line_64'>      these barons, with the doge and marquis at their head, expected</a>
<a id='line_65'>      the decision of the twelve electors. It was announced by the</a>
<a id='line_66'>      bishop of Soissons, in the name of his colleagues: “Ye have sworn</a>
<a id='line_67'>      to obey the prince whom we should choose: by our unanimous</a>
<a id='line_68'>      suffrage, Baldwin count of Flanders and Hainault is now your</a>
<a id='line_69'>      sovereign, and the emperor of the East.” He was saluted with loud</a>
<a id='line_70'>      applause, and the proclamation was reechoed through the city by</a>
<a id='line_71'>      the joy of the Latins, and the trembling adulation of the Greeks.</a>
<a id='line_72'>      Boniface was the first to kiss the hand of his rival, and to</a>
<a id='line_73'>      raise him on the buckler: and Baldwin was transported to the</a>
<a id='line_74'>      cathedral, and solemnly invested with the purple buskins. At the</a>
<a id='line_75'>      end of three weeks he was crowned by the legate, in the vacancy</a>
<a id='line_76'>      of the patriarch; but the Venetian clergy soon filled the chapter</a>
<a id='line_77'>      of St. Sophia, seated Thomas Morosini on the ecclesiastical</a>
<a id='line_78'>      throne, and employed every art to perpetuate in their own nation</a>
<a id='line_79'>      the honors and benefices of the Greek church. 4 Without delay the</a>
<a id='line_80'>      successor of Constantine instructed Palestine, France, and Rome,</a>
<a id='line_81'>      of this memorable revolution. To Palestine he sent, as a trophy,</a>
<a id='line_82'>      the gates of Constantinople, and the chain of the harbor; 5 and</a>
<a id='line_83'>      adopted, from the Assise of Jerusalem, the laws or customs best</a>
<a id='line_84'>      adapted to a French colony and conquest in the East. In his</a>
<a id='line_85'>      epistles, the natives of France are encouraged to swell that</a>
<a id='line_86'>      colony, and to secure that conquest, to people a magnificent city</a>
<a id='line_87'>      and a fertile land, which will reward the labors both of the</a>
<a id='line_88'>      priest and the soldier. He congratulates the Roman pontiff on the</a>
<a id='line_89'>      restoration of his authority in the East; invites him to</a>
<a id='line_90'>      extinguish the Greek schism by his presence in a general council;</a>
<a id='line_91'>      and implores his blessing and forgiveness for the disobedient</a>
<a id='line_92'>      pilgrims. Prudence and dignity are blended in the answer of</a>
<a id='line_93'>      Innocent. 6 In the subversion of the Byzantine empire, he</a>
<a id='line_94'>      arraigns the vices of man, and adores the providence of God; the</a>
<a id='line_95'>      conquerors will be absolved or condemned by their future conduct;</a>
<a id='line_96'>      the validity of their treaty depends on the judgment of St.</a>
<a id='line_97'>      Peter; but he inculcates their most sacred duty of establishing a</a>
<a id='line_98'>      just subordination of obedience and tribute, from the Greeks to</a>
<a id='line_99'>      the Latins, from the magistrate to the clergy, and from the</a>
<a id='line_100'>      clergy to the pope.</a>

<a id='line_136'>      In the division of the Greek provinces, 7 the share of the</a>
<a id='line_137'>      Venetians was more ample than that of the Latin emperor. No more</a>
<a id='line_138'>      than one fourth was appropriated to his domain; a clear moiety of</a>
<a id='line_139'>      the remainder was reserved for Venice; and the other moiety was</a>
<a id='line_140'>      distributed among the adventurers of France and Lombardy. The</a>
<a id='line_141'>      venerable Dandolo was proclaimed despot of Romania, and invested</a>
<a id='line_142'>      after the Greek fashion with the purple buskins. He ended at</a>
<a id='line_143'>      Constantinople his long and glorious life; and if the prerogative</a>
<a id='line_144'>      was personal, the title was used by his successors till the</a>
<a id='line_145'>      middle of the fourteenth century, with the singular, though true,</a>
<a id='line_146'>      addition of lords of one fourth and a half of the Roman empire. 8</a>
<a id='line_147'>      The doge, a slave of state, was seldom permitted to depart from</a>
<a id='line_148'>      the helm of the republic; but his place was supplied by the</a>
<a id='line_149'>      _bail_, or regent, who exercised a supreme jurisdiction over the</a>
<a id='line_150'>      colony of Venetians: they possessed three of the eight quarters</a>
<a id='line_151'>      of the city; and his independent tribunal was composed of six</a>
<a id='line_152'>      judges, four counsellors, two chamberlains two fiscal advocates,</a>
<a id='line_153'>      and a constable. Their long experience of the Eastern trade</a>
<a id='line_154'>      enabled them to select their portion with discernment: they had</a>
<a id='line_155'>      rashly accepted the dominion and defence of Adrianople; but it</a>
<a id='line_156'>      was the more reasonable aim of their policy to form a chain of</a>
<a id='line_157'>      factories, and cities, and islands, along the maritime coast,</a>
<a id='line_158'>      from the neighborhood of Ragusa to the Hellespont and the</a>
<a id='line_159'>      Bosphorus. The labor and cost of such extensive conquests</a>
<a id='line_160'>      exhausted their treasury: they abandoned their maxims of</a>
<a id='line_161'>      government, adopted a feudal system, and contented themselves</a>
<a id='line_162'>      with the homage of their nobles, 9 for the possessions which</a>
<a id='line_163'>      these private vassals undertook to reduce and maintain. And thus</a>
<a id='line_164'>      it was that the family of Sanut acquired the duchy of Naxos,</a>
<a id='line_165'>      which involved the greatest part of the archipelago. For the</a>
<a id='line_166'>      price of ten thousand marks, the republic purchased of the</a>
<a id='line_167'>      marquis of Montferrat the fertile Island of Crete or Candia, with</a>
<a id='line_168'>      the ruins of a hundred cities; 10 but its improvement was stinted</a>
<a id='line_169'>      by the proud and narrow spirit of an aristocracy; 11 and the</a>
<a id='line_170'>      wisest senators would confess that the sea, not the land, was the</a>
<a id='line_171'>      treasury of St. Mark. In the moiety of the adventurers the</a>
<a id='line_172'>      marquis Boniface might claim the most liberal reward; and,</a>
<a id='line_173'>      besides the Isle of Crete, his exclusion from the throne was</a>
<a id='line_174'>      compensated by the royal title and the provinces beyond the</a>
<a id='line_175'>      Hellespont. But he prudently exchanged that distant and difficult</a>
<a id='line_176'>      conquest for the kingdom of Thessalonica Macedonia, twelve days’</a>
<a id='line_177'>      journey from the capital, where he might be supported by the</a>
<a id='line_178'>      neighboring powers of his brother-in-law the king of Hungary. His</a>
<a id='line_179'>      progress was hailed by the voluntary or reluctant acclamations of</a>
<a id='line_180'>      the natives; and Greece, the proper and ancient Greece, again</a>
<a id='line_181'>      received a Latin conqueror, 12 who trod with indifference that</a>
<a id='line_182'>      classic ground. He viewed with a careless eye the beauties of the</a>
<a id='line_183'>      valley of Tempe; traversed with a cautious step the straits of</a>
<a id='line_184'>      Thermopylæ; occupied the unknown cities of Thebes, Athens, and</a>
<a id='line_185'>      Argos; and assaulted the fortifications of Corinth and Napoli, 13</a>
<a id='line_186'>      which resisted his arms. The lots of the Latin pilgrims were</a>
<a id='line_187'>      regulated by chance, or choice, or subsequent exchange; and they</a>
<a id='line_188'>      abused, with intemperate joy, their triumph over the lives and</a>
<a id='line_189'>      fortunes of a great people. After a minute survey of the</a>
<a id='line_190'>      provinces, they weighed in the scales of avarice the revenue of</a>
<a id='line_191'>      each district, the advantage of the situation, and the ample or</a>
<a id='line_192'>      scanty supplies for the maintenance of soldiers and horses. Their</a>
<a id='line_193'>      presumption claimed and divided the long-lost dependencies of the</a>
<a id='line_194'>      Roman sceptre: the Nile and Euphrates rolled through their</a>
<a id='line_195'>      imaginary realms; and happy was the warrior who drew for his</a>
<a id='line_196'>      prize the palace of the Turkish sultan of Iconium. 14 I shall not</a>
<a id='line_197'>      descend to the pedigree of families and the rent-roll of estates,</a>
<a id='line_198'>      but I wish to specify that the counts of Blois and St. Pol were</a>
<a id='line_199'>      invested with the duchy of Nice and the lordship of Demotica: 15</a>
<a id='line_200'>      the principal fiefs were held by the service of constable,</a>
<a id='line_201'>      chamberlain, cup-bearer, butler, and chief cook; and our</a>
<a id='line_202'>      historian, Jeffrey of Villehardouin, obtained a fair</a>
<a id='line_203'>      establishment on the banks of the Hebrus, and united the double</a>
<a id='line_204'>      office of marshal of Champagne and Romania. At the head of his</a>
<a id='line_205'>      knights and archers, each baron mounted on horseback to secure</a>
<a id='line_206'>      the possession of his share, and their first efforts were</a>
<a id='line_207'>      generally successful. But the public force was weakened by their</a>
<a id='line_208'>      dispersion; and a thousand quarrels must arise under a law, and</a>
<a id='line_209'>      among men, whose sole umpire was the sword. Within three months</a>
<a id='line_210'>      after the conquest of Constantinople, the emperor and the king of</a>
<a id='line_211'>      Thessalonica drew their hostile followers into the field; they</a>
<a id='line_212'>      were reconciled by the authority of the doge, the advice of the</a>
<a id='line_213'>      marshal, and the firm freedom of their peers. 16</a>

<a id='line_301'>      was seized by the Latins of Constantinople, and condemned, after</a>

<a id='line_311'>      sent by the marquis a captive to Italy, and a gift to the king of</a>
<a id='line_312'>      the Romans; but he had not much to applaud his fortune, if the</a>
<a id='line_313'>      sentence of imprisonment and exile were changed from a fortress</a>
<a id='line_314'>      in the Alps to a monastery in Asia. But his daughter, before the</a>

<a id='line_316'>      continued the succession, and restored the throne, of the Greek</a>
<a id='line_317'>      princes. 20 The valor of Theodore Lascaris was signalized in the</a>
<a id='line_318'>      two sieges of Constantinople. After the flight of Mourzoufle,</a>
<a id='line_319'>      when the Latins were already in the city, he offered himself as</a>
<a id='line_320'>      their emperor to the soldiers and people; and his ambition, which</a>
<a id='line_321'>      might be virtuous, was undoubtedly brave. Could he have infused a</a>
<a id='line_322'>      soul into the multitude, they might have crushed the strangers</a>
<a id='line_323'>      under their feet: their abject despair refused his aid; and</a>
<a id='line_324'>      Theodore retired to breathe the air of freedom in Anatolia,</a>
<a id='line_325'>      beyond the immediate view and pursuit of the conquerors. Under</a>
<a id='line_326'>      the title, at first of despot, and afterwards of emperor, he drew</a>
<a id='line_327'>      to his standard the bolder spirits, who were fortified against</a>
<a id='line_328'>      slavery by the contempt of life; and as every means was lawful</a>
<a id='line_329'>      for the public safety implored without scruple the alliance of</a>
<a id='line_330'>      the Turkish sultan Nice, where Theodore established his</a>
<a id='line_331'>      residence, Prusa and Philadelphia, Smyrna and Ephesus, opened</a>
<a id='line_332'>      their gates to their deliverer: he derived strength and</a>
<a id='line_333'>      reputation from his victories, and even from his defeats; and the</a>
<a id='line_334'>      successor of Constantine preserved a fragment of the empire from</a>
<a id='line_335'>      the banks of the Mæander to the suburbs of Nicomedia, and at</a>
<a id='line_336'>      length of Constantinople. Another portion, distant and obscure,</a>
<a id='line_337'>      was possessed by the lineal heir of the Comneni, a son of the</a>
<a id='line_338'>      virtuous Manuel, a grandson of the tyrant Andronicus. His name</a>
<a id='line_339'>      was Alexius; and the epithet of great 201 was applied perhaps to</a>
<a id='line_340'>      his stature, rather than to his exploits. By the indulgence of</a>
<a id='line_341'>      the Angeli, he was appointed governor or duke of Trebizond: 21</a>
<a id='line_342'>      211 his birth gave him ambition, the revolution independence;</a>
<a id='line_343'>      and, without changing his title, he reigned in peace from Sinope</a>
<a id='line_344'>      to the Phasis, along the coast of the Black Sea. His nameless son</a>
<a id='line_345'>      and successor 212 is described as the vassal of the sultan, whom</a>
<a id='line_346'>      he served with two hundred lances: that Comnenian prince was no</a>
<a id='line_347'>      more than duke of Trebizond, and the title of emperor was first</a>
<a id='line_348'>      assumed by the pride and envy of the grandson of Alexius. In the</a>
<a id='line_349'>      West, a third fragment was saved from the common shipwreck by</a>
<a id='line_350'>      Michael, a bastard of the house of Angeli, who, before the</a>
<a id='line_351'>      revolution, had been known as a hostage, a soldier, and a rebel.</a>
<a id='line_352'>      His flight from the camp of the marquis Boniface secured his</a>
<a id='line_353'>      freedom; by his marriage with the governor’s daughter, he</a>
<a id='line_354'>      commanded the important place of Durazzo, assumed the title of</a>
<a id='line_355'>      despot, and founded a strong and conspicuous principality in</a>
<a id='line_356'>      Epirus, Ætolia, and Thessaly, which have ever been peopled by a</a>
<a id='line_357'>      warlike race. The Greeks, who had offered their service to their</a>
<a id='line_358'>      new sovereigns, were excluded by the haughty Latins 22 from all</a>
<a id='line_359'>      civil and military honors, as a nation born to tremble and obey.</a>
<a id='line_360'>      Their resentment prompted them to show that they might have been</a>
<a id='line_361'>      useful friends, since they could be dangerous enemies: their</a>
<a id='line_362'>      nerves were braced by adversity: whatever was learned or holy,</a>
<a id='line_363'>      whatever was noble or valiant, rolled away into the independent</a>
<a id='line_364'>      states of Trebizond, Epirus, and Nice; and a single patrician is</a>
<a id='line_365'>      marked by the ambiguous praise of attachment and loyalty to the</a>
<a id='line_366'>      Franks. The vulgar herd of the cities and the country would have</a>
<a id='line_367'>      gladly submitted to a mild and regular servitude; and the</a>
<a id='line_368'>      transient disorders of war would have been obliterated by some</a>
<a id='line_369'>      years of industry and peace. But peace was banished, and industry</a>
<a id='line_370'>      was crushed, in the disorders of the feudal system. The _Roman_</a>
<a id='line_371'>      emperors of Constantinople, if they were endowed with abilities,</a>
<a id='line_372'>      were armed with power for the protection of their subjects: their</a>
<a id='line_373'>      laws were wise, and their administration was simple. The Latin</a>
<a id='line_374'>      throne was filled by a titular prince, the chief, and often the</a>
<a id='line_375'>      servant, of his licentious confederates; the fiefs of the empire,</a>
<a id='line_376'>      from a kingdom to a castle, were held and ruled by the sword of</a>
<a id='line_377'>      the barons; and their discord, poverty, and ignorance, extended</a>
<a id='line_378'>      the ramifications of tyranny to the most sequestered villages.</a>
<a id='line_379'>      The Greeks were oppressed by the double weight of the priests,</a>
<a id='line_380'>      who were invested with temporal power, and of the soldier, who</a>
<a id='line_381'>      was inflamed by fanatic hatred; and the insuperable bar of</a>
<a id='line_382'>      religion and language forever separated the stranger and the</a>

<a id='line_497'>      successors of Constantine; and his ambassadors were dismissed</a>

<a id='line_499'>      touching with his forehead the footstool of the Imperial throne.</a>
<a id='line_500'>      His resentment 24 would have exhaled in acts of violence and</a>
<a id='line_501'>      blood: his cooler policy watched the rising discontent of the</a>
<a id='line_502'>      Greeks; affected a tender concern for their sufferings; and</a>
<a id='line_503'>      promised, that their first struggles for freedom should be</a>
<a id='line_504'>      supported by his person and kingdom. The conspiracy was</a>
<a id='line_505'>      propagated by national hatred, the firmest band of association</a>
<a id='line_506'>      and secrecy: the Greeks were impatient to sheathe their daggers</a>
<a id='line_507'>      in the breasts of the victorious strangers; but the execution was</a>
<a id='line_508'>      prudently delayed, till Henry, the emperor’s brother, had</a>
<a id='line_509'>      transported the flower of his troops beyond the Hellespont. Most</a>
<a id='line_510'>      of the towns and villages of Thrace were true to the moment and</a>
<a id='line_511'>      the signal; and the Latins, without arms or suspicion, were</a>
<a id='line_512'>      slaughtered by the vile and merciless revenge of their slaves.</a>
<a id='line_513'>      From Demotica, the first scene of the massacre, the surviving</a>
<a id='line_514'>      vassals of the count of St. Pol escaped to Adrianople; but the</a>
<a id='line_515'>      French and Venetians, who occupied that city, were slain or</a>
<a id='line_516'>      expelled by the furious multitude: the garrisons that could</a>
<a id='line_517'>      effect their retreat fell back on each other towards the</a>
<a id='line_518'>      metropolis; and the fortresses, that separately stood against the</a>
<a id='line_519'>      rebels, were ignorant of each other’s and of their sovereign’s</a>
<a id='line_520'>      fate. The voice of fame and fear announced the revolt of the</a>
<a id='line_521'>      Greeks and the rapid approach of their Bulgarian ally; and</a>
<a id='line_522'>      Calo-John, not depending on the forces of his own kingdom, had</a>
<a id='line_523'>      drawn from the Scythian wilderness a body of fourteen thousand</a>
<a id='line_524'>      Comans, who drank, as it was said, the blood of their captives,</a>

<a id='line_536'></a>
<a id='line_537'>      Alarmed by this sudden and growing danger, the emperor despatched</a>

<a id='line_543'>      caution from cowardice; and the emperor took the field with a</a>
<a id='line_544'>      hundred and forty knights, and their train of archers and</a>
<a id='line_545'>      sergeants. The marshal, who dissuaded and obeyed, led the</a>
<a id='line_546'>      vanguard in their march to Adrianople; the main body was</a>
<a id='line_547'>      commanded by the count of Blois; the aged doge of Venice followed</a>
<a id='line_548'>      with the rear; and their scanty numbers were increased from all</a>
<a id='line_549'>      sides by the fugitive Latins. They undertook to besiege the</a>

<a id='line_551'>      crusades that they employed the holy week in pillaging the</a>
<a id='line_552'>      country for their subsistence, and in framing engines for the</a>
<a id='line_553'>      destruction of their fellow-Christians. But the Latins were soon</a>
<a id='line_554'>      interrupted and alarmed by the light cavalry of the Comans, who</a>
<a id='line_555'>      boldly skirmished to the edge of their imperfect lines: and a</a>

<a id='line_593'>      was a passion, rather than a science. His grief and fears were</a>

<a id='line_597'>      perilous station between the city and the Barbarians:</a>
<a id='line_598'>      Villehardouin decamped in silence at the dead of night; and his</a>
<a id='line_599'>      masterly retreat of three days would have deserved the praise of</a>
<a id='line_600'>      Xenophon and the ten thousand. In the rear, the marshal supported</a>
<a id='line_601'>      the weight of the pursuit; in the front, he moderated the</a>
<a id='line_602'>      impatience of the fugitives; and wherever the Comans approached,</a>
<a id='line_603'>      they were repelled by a line of impenetrable spears. On the third</a>

<a id='line_605'>      Rodosta, 27 and their friends, who had landed from the Asiatic</a>
<a id='line_606'>      shore. They embraced, they wept; but they united their arms and</a>
<a id='line_607'>      counsels; and in his brother’s absence, Count Henry assumed the</a>
<a id='line_608'>      regency of the empire, at once in a state of childhood and</a>
<a id='line_609'>      caducity. 28 If the Comans withdrew from the summer heats, seven</a>
<a id='line_610'>      thousand Latins, in the hour of danger, deserted Constantinople,</a>
<a id='line_611'>      their brethren, and their vows. Some partial success was</a>
<a id='line_612'>      overbalanced by the loss of one hundred and twenty knights in the</a>
<a id='line_613'>      field of Rusium; and of the Imperial domain, no more was left</a>
<a id='line_614'>      than the capital, with two or three adjacent fortresses on the</a>
<a id='line_615'>      shores of Europe and Asia. The king of Bulgaria was resistless</a>
<a id='line_616'>      and inexorable; and Calo-John respectfully eluded the demands of</a>
<a id='line_617'>      the pope, who conjured his new proselyte to restore peace and the</a>
<a id='line_618'>      emperor to the afflicted Latins. The deliverance of Baldwin was</a>
<a id='line_619'>      no longer, he said, in the power of man: that prince had died in</a>
<a id='line_620'>      prison; and the manner of his death is variously related by</a>
<a id='line_621'>      ignorance and credulity. The lovers of a tragic legend will be</a>
<a id='line_622'>      pleased to hear, that the royal captive was tempted by the</a>

<a id='line_627'>      and that he breathed three days, before he was devoured by the</a>
<a id='line_628'>      birds of prey. 29 About twenty years afterwards, in a wood of the</a>
<a id='line_629'>      Netherlands, a hermit announced himself as the true Baldwin, the</a>
<a id='line_630'>      emperor of Constantinople, and lawful sovereign of Flanders. He</a>
<a id='line_631'>      related the wonders of his escape, his adventures, and his</a>

<a id='line_676'>      emperor. His moderation was applauded by the Greeks as an act of</a>
<a id='line_677'>      rare and inimitable virtue. Their light and perfidious ambition</a>

<a id='line_682'>      gradually left without an associate, as the heroes of the crusade</a>
<a id='line_683'>      retired from the world or from the war. The doge of Venice, the</a>
<a id='line_684'>      venerable Dandolo, in the fulness of years and glory, sunk into</a>
<a id='line_685'>      the grave. The marquis of Montferrat was slowly recalled from the</a>
<a id='line_686'>      Peloponnesian war to the revenge of Baldwin and the defence of</a>
<a id='line_687'>      Thessalonica. Some nice disputes of feudal homage and service</a>
<a id='line_688'>      were reconciled in a personal interview between the emperor and</a>
<a id='line_689'>      the king; they were firmly united by mutual esteem and the common</a>
<a id='line_690'>      danger; and their alliance was sealed by the nuptials of Henry</a>
<a id='line_691'>      with the daughter of the Italian prince. He soon deplored the</a>
<a id='line_692'>      loss of his friend and father. At the persuasion of some faithful</a>
<a id='line_693'>      Greeks, Boniface made a bold and successful inroad among the</a>
<a id='line_694'>      hills of Rhodope: the Bulgarians fled on his approach; they</a>
<a id='line_695'>      assembled to harass his retreat. On the intelligence that his</a>
<a id='line_696'>      rear was attacked, without waiting for any defensive armor, he</a>
<a id='line_697'>      leaped on horseback, couched his lance, and drove the enemies</a>
<a id='line_698'>      before him; but in the rash pursuit he was pierced with a mortal</a>
<a id='line_699'>      wound; and the head of the king of Thessalonica was presented to</a>
<a id='line_700'>      Calo-John, who enjoyed the honors, without the merit, of victory.</a>
<a id='line_701'>      It is here, at this melancholy event, that the pen or the voice</a>
<a id='line_702'>      of Jeffrey of Villehardouin seems to drop or to expire; 31 and if</a>
<a id='line_703'>      he still exercised his military office of marshal of Romania, his</a>
<a id='line_704'>      subsequent exploits are buried in oblivion. 32 The character of</a>
<a id='line_705'>      Henry was not unequal to his arduous situation: in the siege of</a>
<a id='line_706'>      Constantinople, and beyond the Hellespont, he had deserved the</a>
<a id='line_707'>      fame of a valiant knight and a skilful commander; and his courage</a>
<a id='line_708'>      was tempered with a degree of prudence and mildness unknown to</a>
<a id='line_709'>      his impetuous brother. In the double war against the Greeks of</a>
<a id='line_710'>      Asia and the Bulgarians of Europe, he was ever the foremost on</a>
<a id='line_711'>      shipboard or on horseback; and though he cautiously provided for</a>
<a id='line_712'>      the success of his arms, the drooping Latins were often roused by</a>
<a id='line_713'>      his example to save and to second their fearless emperor. But</a>
<a id='line_714'>      such efforts, and some supplies of men and money from France,</a>
<a id='line_715'>      were of less avail than the errors, the cruelty, and death, of</a>
<a id='line_716'>      their most formidable adversary. When the despair of the Greek</a>
<a id='line_717'>      subjects invited Calo-John as their deliverer, they hoped that he</a>
<a id='line_718'>      would protect their liberty and adopt their laws: they were soon</a>
<a id='line_719'>      taught to compare the degrees of national ferocity, and to</a>
<a id='line_720'>      execrate the savage conqueror, who no longer dissembled his</a>
<a id='line_721'>      intention of dispeopling Thrace, of demolishing the cities, and</a>
<a id='line_722'>      of transplanting the inhabitants beyond the Danube. Many towns</a>
<a id='line_723'>      and villages of Thrace were already evacuated: a heap of ruins</a>
<a id='line_724'>      marked the place of Philippopolis, and a similar calamity was</a>
<a id='line_725'>      expected at Demotica and Adrianople, by the first authors of the</a>
<a id='line_726'>      revolt. They raised a cry of grief and repentance to the throne</a>
<a id='line_727'>      of Henry; the emperor alone had the magnanimity to forgive and</a>
<a id='line_728'>      trust them. No more than four hundred knights, with their</a>
<a id='line_729'>      sergeants and archers, could be assembled under his banner; and</a>
<a id='line_730'>      with this slender force he fought 321 and repulsed the Bulgarian,</a>
<a id='line_731'>      who, besides his infantry, was at the head of forty thousand</a>
<a id='line_732'>      horse. In this expedition, Henry felt the difference between a</a>
<a id='line_733'>      hostile and a friendly country: the remaining cities were</a>
<a id='line_734'>      preserved by his arms; and the savage, with shame and loss, was</a>
<a id='line_735'>      compelled to relinquish his prey. The siege of Thessalonica was</a>
<a id='line_736'>      the last of the evils which Calo-John inflicted or suffered: he</a>
<a id='line_737'>      was stabbed in the night in his tent; and the general, perhaps</a>
<a id='line_738'>      the assassin, who found him weltering in his blood, ascribed the</a>
<a id='line_739'>      blow, with general applause, to the lance of St. Demetrius. 33</a>
<a id='line_740'>      After several victories, the prudence of Henry concluded an</a>
<a id='line_741'>      honorable peace with the successor of the tyrant, and with the</a>
<a id='line_742'>      Greek princes of Nice and Epirus. If he ceded some doubtful</a>
<a id='line_743'>      limits, an ample kingdom was reserved for himself and his</a>
<a id='line_744'>      feudatories; and his reign, which lasted only ten years, afforded</a>
<a id='line_745'>      a short interval of prosperity and peace. Far above the narrow</a>
<a id='line_746'>      policy of Baldwin and Boniface, he freely intrusted to the Greeks</a>

<a id='line_749'>      the princes of Nice and Epirus had already learned to seduce and</a>
<a id='line_750'>      employ the mercenary valor of the Latins. It was the aim of Henry</a>
<a id='line_751'>      to unite and reward his deserving subjects, of every nation and</a>
<a id='line_752'>      language; but he appeared less solicitous to accomplish the</a>
<a id='line_753'>      impracticable union of the two churches. Pelagius, the pope’s</a>
<a id='line_754'>      legate, who acted as the sovereign of Constantinople, had</a>
<a id='line_755'>      interdicted the worship of the Greeks, and sternly imposed the</a>
<a id='line_756'>      payment of tithes, the double procession of the Holy Ghost, and a</a>
<a id='line_757'>      blind obedience to the Roman pontiff. As the weaker party, they</a>
<a id='line_758'>      pleaded the duties of conscience, and implored the rights of</a>
<a id='line_759'>      toleration: “Our bodies,” they said, “are Cæsar’s, but our souls</a>
<a id='line_760'>      belong only to God.” The persecution was checked by the firmness</a>
<a id='line_761'>      of the emperor: 34 and if we can believe that the same prince was</a>
<a id='line_762'>      poisoned by the Greeks themselves, we must entertain a</a>
<a id='line_763'>      contemptible idea of the sense and gratitude of mankind. His</a>
<a id='line_764'>      valor was a vulgar attribute, which he shared with ten thousand</a>
<a id='line_765'>      knights; but Henry possessed the superior courage to oppose, in a</a>
<a id='line_766'>      superstitious age, the pride and avarice of the clergy. In the</a>
<a id='line_767'>      cathedral of St. Sophia he presumed to place his throne on the</a>
<a id='line_768'>      right hand of the patriarch; and this presumption excited the</a>
<a id='line_769'>      sharpest censure of Pope Innocent the Third. By a salutary edict,</a>
<a id='line_770'>      one of the first examples of the laws of mortmain, he prohibited</a>
<a id='line_771'>      the alienation of fiefs: many of the Latins, desirous of</a>
<a id='line_772'>      returning to Europe, resigned their estates to the church for a</a>
<a id='line_773'>      spiritual or temporal reward; these holy lands were immediately</a>
<a id='line_774'>      discharged from military service, and a colony of soldiers would</a>
<a id='line_775'>      have been gradually transformed into a college of priests. 35</a>

<a id='line_892'>      derived from his mother the inheritance of Namur, had the wisdom</a>

<a id='line_895'>      Peter and Yolande, was called to the throne of Constantinople.</a>
<a id='line_896'>      Warned by his father’s mischance, he pursued his slow and secure</a>
<a id='line_897'>      journey through Germany and along the Danube: a passage was</a>

<a id='line_901'>      and the colony, as it was styled, of New France yielded on all</a>
<a id='line_902'>      sides to the Greeks of Nice and Epirus. After a victory, which he</a>
<a id='line_903'>      owed to his perfidy rather than his courage, Theodore Angelus</a>
<a id='line_904'>      entered the kingdom of Thessalonica, expelled the feeble</a>
<a id='line_905'>      Demetrius, the son of the marquis Boniface, erected his standard</a>
<a id='line_906'>      on the walls of Adrianople; and added, by his vanity, a third or</a>
<a id='line_907'>      a fourth name to the list of rival emperors. The relics of the</a>
<a id='line_908'>      Asiatic province were swept away by John Vataces, the son-in-law</a>
<a id='line_909'>      and successor of Theodore Lascaris, and who, in a triumphant</a>
<a id='line_910'>      reign of thirty-three years, displayed the virtues both of peace</a>
<a id='line_911'>      and war. Under his discipline, the swords of the French</a>
<a id='line_912'>      mercenaries were the most effectual instruments of his conquests,</a>
<a id='line_913'>      and their desertion from the service of their country was at once</a>
<a id='line_914'>      a symptom and a cause of the rising ascendant of the Greeks. By</a>
<a id='line_915'>      the construction of a fleet, he obtained the command of the</a>
<a id='line_916'>      Hellespont, reduced the islands of Lesbos and Rhodes, attacked</a>
<a id='line_917'>      the Venetians of Candia, and intercepted the rare and</a>
<a id='line_918'>      parsimonious succors of the West. Once, and once only, the Latin</a>
<a id='line_919'>      emperor sent an army against Vataces; and in the defeat of that</a>
<a id='line_920'>      army, the veteran knights, the last of the original conquerors,</a>
<a id='line_921'>      were left on the field of battle. But the success of a foreign</a>
<a id='line_922'>      enemy was less painful to the pusillanimous Robert than the</a>
<a id='line_923'>      insolence of his Latin subjects, who confounded the weakness of</a>
<a id='line_924'>      the emperor and of the empire. His personal misfortunes will</a>
<a id='line_925'>      prove the anarchy of the government and the ferociousness of the</a>
<a id='line_926'>      times. The amorous youth had neglected his Greek bride, the</a>
<a id='line_927'>      daughter of Vataces, to introduce into the palace a beautiful</a>
<a id='line_928'>      maid, of a private, though noble family of Artois; and her mother</a>
<a id='line_929'>      had been tempted by the lustre of the purple to forfeit her</a>
<a id='line_930'>      engagements with a gentleman of Burgundy. His love was converted</a>

<a id='line_932'>      threw the mother into the sea, and inhumanly cut off the nose and</a>
<a id='line_933'>      lips of the wife or concubine of the emperor. Instead of</a>

<a id='line_965'>      were still ready for the service of Christendom. In the seven</a>
<a id='line_966'>      years of his brother’s reign, Baldwin of Courtenay had not</a>

<a id='line_968'>      the strong necessity of placing the sceptre in the hands of a man</a>
<a id='line_969'>      and a hero. The veteran king of Jerusalem might have disdained</a>

<a id='line_972'>      condition that Baldwin should marry his second daughter, and</a>
<a id='line_973'>      succeed at a mature age to the throne of Constantinople. The</a>
<a id='line_974'>      expectation, both of the Greeks and Latins, was kindled by the</a>
<a id='line_975'>      renown, the choice, and the presence of John of Brienne; and they</a>
<a id='line_976'>      admired his martial aspect, his green and vigorous age of more</a>
<a id='line_977'>      than fourscore years, and his size and stature, which surpassed</a>
<a id='line_978'>      the common measure of mankind. 42 But avarice, and the love of</a>
<a id='line_979'>      ease, appear to have chilled the ardor of enterprise: 421 his</a>
<a id='line_980'>      troops were disbanded, and two years rolled away without action</a>
<a id='line_981'>      or honor, till he was awakened by the dangerous alliance of</a>
<a id='line_982'>      Vataces emperor of Nice, and of Azan king of Bulgaria. They</a>
<a id='line_983'>      besieged Constantinople by sea and land, with an army of one</a>
<a id='line_984'>      hundred thousand men, and a fleet of three hundred ships of war;</a>
<a id='line_985'>      while the entire force of the Latin emperor was reduced to one</a>
<a id='line_986'>      hundred and sixty knights, and a small addition of sergeants and</a>
<a id='line_987'>      archers. I tremble to relate, that instead of defending the city,</a>
<a id='line_988'>      the hero made a sally at the head of his cavalry; and that of</a>
<a id='line_989'>      forty-eight squadrons of the enemy, no more than three escaped</a>

<a id='line_991'>      infantry and the citizens boarded the vessels that anchored close</a>
<a id='line_992'>      to the walls; and twenty-five were dragged in triumph into the</a>
<a id='line_993'>      harbor of Constantinople. At the summons of the emperor, the</a>

<a id='line_1057'>      Frederic the Second was excommunicated and deposed, his Oriental</a>

<a id='line_1060'>      with scorn, insulted with pity, and degraded in his own eyes and</a>

<a id='line_1062'>      stopped at Dover by a severe reprimand, that he should presume,</a>
<a id='line_1063'>      without leave, to enter an independent kingdom. After some delay,</a>
<a id='line_1064'>      Baldwin, however, was permitted to pursue his journey, was</a>
<a id='line_1065'>      entertained with cold civility, and thankfully departed with a</a>
<a id='line_1066'>      present of seven hundred marks. 46 From the avarice of Rome he</a>
<a id='line_1067'>      could only obtain the proclamation of a crusade, and a treasure</a>
<a id='line_1068'>      of indulgences; a coin whose currency was depreciated by too</a>

<a id='line_1070'>      recommended him to the generosity of his cousin Louis the Ninth;</a>

<a id='line_1072'>      Constantinople to Egypt and Palestine; and the public and private</a>
<a id='line_1073'>      poverty of Baldwin was alleviated, for a moment, by the</a>
<a id='line_1074'>      alienation of the marquisate of Namur and the lordship of</a>
<a id='line_1075'>      Courtenay, the last remains of his inheritance. 47 By such</a>
<a id='line_1076'>      shameful or ruinous expedients, he once more returned to Romania,</a>
<a id='line_1077'>      with an army of thirty thousand soldiers, whose numbers were</a>
<a id='line_1078'>      doubled in the apprehension of the Greeks. His first despatches</a>
<a id='line_1079'>      to France and England announced his victories and his hopes: he</a>
<a id='line_1080'>      had reduced the country round the capital to the distance of</a>
<a id='line_1081'>      three days’ journey; and if he succeeded against an important,</a>
<a id='line_1082'>      though nameless, city, (most probably Chiorli,) the frontier</a>
<a id='line_1083'>      would be safe and the passage accessible. But these expectations</a>
<a id='line_1084'>      (if Baldwin was sincere) quickly vanished like a dream: the</a>
<a id='line_1085'>      troops and treasures of France melted away in his unskilful</a>
<a id='line_1086'>      hands; and the throne of the Latin emperor was protected by a</a>
<a id='line_1087'>      dishonorable alliance with the Turks and Comans. To secure the</a>
<a id='line_1088'>      former, he consented to bestow his niece on the unbelieving</a>
<a id='line_1089'>      sultan of Cogni; to please the latter, he complied with their</a>
<a id='line_1090'>      Pagan rites; a dog was sacrificed between the two armies; and the</a>

<a id='line_1139'>      another relic of the Passion was preserved in the Imperial chapel</a>
<a id='line_1140'>      of Constantinople; and the crown of thorns which had been placed</a>
<a id='line_1141'>      on the head of Christ was equally precious and authentic. It had</a>

<a id='line_1145'>      same manner, and in the absence of the emperor, the barons of</a>
<a id='line_1146'>      Romania borrowed the sum of thirteen thousand one hundred and</a>
<a id='line_1147'>      thirty-four pieces of gold 50 on the credit of the holy crown:</a>
<a id='line_1148'>      they failed in the performance of their contract; and a rich</a>
<a id='line_1149'>      Venetian, Nicholas Querini, undertook to satisfy their impatient</a>
<a id='line_1150'>      creditors, on condition that the relic should be lodged at</a>
<a id='line_1151'>      Venice, to become his absolute property, if it were not redeemed</a>
<a id='line_1152'>      within a short and definite term. The barons apprised their</a>
<a id='line_1153'>      sovereign of the hard treaty and impending loss and as the empire</a>
<a id='line_1154'>      could not afford a ransom of seven thousand pounds sterling,</a>
<a id='line_1155'>      Baldwin was anxious to snatch the prize from the Venetians, and</a>
<a id='line_1156'>      to vest it with more honor and emolument in the hands of the most</a>
<a id='line_1157'>      Christian king. 51 Yet the negotiation was attended with some</a>
<a id='line_1158'>      delicacy. In the purchase of relics, the saint would have started</a>
<a id='line_1159'>      at the guilt of simony; but if the mode of expression were</a>
<a id='line_1160'>      changed, he might lawfully repay the debt, accept the gift, and</a>
<a id='line_1161'>      acknowledge the obligation. His ambassadors, two Dominicans, were</a>
<a id='line_1162'>      despatched to Venice to redeem and receive the holy crown which</a>
<a id='line_1163'>      had escaped the dangers of the sea and the galleys of Vataces. On</a>
<a id='line_1164'>      opening a wooden box, they recognized the seals of the doge and</a>
<a id='line_1165'>      barons, which were applied on a shrine of silver; and within this</a>
<a id='line_1166'>      shrine the monument of the Passion was enclosed in a golden vase.</a>
<a id='line_1167'>      The reluctant Venetians yielded to justice and power: the emperor</a>
<a id='line_1168'>      Frederic granted a free and honorable passage; the court of</a>
<a id='line_1169'>      France advanced as far as Troyes in Champagne, to meet with</a>
<a id='line_1170'>      devotion this inestimable relic: it was borne in triumph through</a>
<a id='line_1171'>      Paris by the king himself, barefoot, and in his shirt; and a free</a>
<a id='line_1172'>      gift of ten thousand marks of silver reconciled Baldwin to his</a>
<a id='line_1173'>      loss. The success of this transaction tempted the Latin emperor</a>
<a id='line_1174'>      to offer with the same generosity the remaining furniture of his</a>

<a id='line_1240'>      revered his merit and power; and had he subscribed an orthodox</a>
<a id='line_1241'>      creed, it should seem that the pope would have abandoned without</a>
<a id='line_1242'>      reluctance the Latin throne of Constantinople. But the death of</a>
<a id='line_1243'>      Vataces, the short and busy reign of Theodore his son, and the</a>
<a id='line_1244'>      helpless infancy of his grandson John, suspended the restoration</a>
<a id='line_1245'>      of the Greeks. In the next chapter, I shall explain their</a>
<a id='line_1246'>      domestic revolutions; in this place, it will be sufficient to</a>
<a id='line_1247'>      observe, that the young prince was oppressed by the ambition of</a>
<a id='line_1248'>      his guardian and colleague, Michael Palæologus, who displayed the</a>
<a id='line_1249'>      virtues and vices that belong to the founder of a new dynasty.</a>
<a id='line_1250'>      The emperor Baldwin had flattered himself, that he might recover</a>
<a id='line_1251'>      some provinces or cities by an impotent negotiation. His</a>
<a id='line_1252'>      ambassadors were dismissed from Nice with mockery and contempt.</a>
<a id='line_1253'>      At every place which they named, Palæologus alleged some special</a>
<a id='line_1254'>      reason, which rendered it dear and valuable in his eyes: in the</a>
<a id='line_1255'>      one he was born; in another he had been first promoted to</a>
<a id='line_1256'>      military command; and in a third he had enjoyed, and hoped long</a>
<a id='line_1257'>      to enjoy, the pleasures of the chase. “And what then do you</a>
<a id='line_1258'>      propose to give us?” said the astonished deputies. “Nothing,”</a>
<a id='line_1259'>      replied the Greek, “not a foot of land. If your master be</a>
<a id='line_1260'>      desirous of peace, let him pay me, as an annual tribute, the sum</a>
<a id='line_1261'>      which he receives from the trade and customs of Constantinople.</a>
<a id='line_1262'>      On these terms, I may allow him to reign. If he refuses, it is</a>
<a id='line_1263'>      war. I am not ignorant of the art of war, and I trust the event</a>
<a id='line_1264'>      to God and my sword.” 56 An expedition against the despot of</a>
<a id='line_1265'>      Epirus was the first prelude of his arms. If a victory was</a>
<a id='line_1266'>      followed by a defeat; if the race of the Comneni or Angeli</a>
<a id='line_1267'>      survived in those mountains his efforts and his reign; the</a>
<a id='line_1268'>      captivity of Villehardouin, prince of Achaia, deprived the Latins</a>
<a id='line_1269'>      of the most active and powerful vassal of their expiring</a>
<a id='line_1270'>      monarchy. The republics of Venice and Genoa disputed, in the</a>
<a id='line_1271'>      first of their naval wars, the command of the sea and the</a>
<a id='line_1272'>      commerce of the East. Pride and interest attached the Venetians</a>
<a id='line_1273'>      to the defence of Constantinople; their rivals were tempted to</a>
<a id='line_1274'>      promote the designs of her enemies, and the alliance of the</a>
<a id='line_1275'>      Genoese with the schismatic conqueror provoked the indignation of</a>

<a id='line_1300'>      assaulted without success the suburb of Galata; and corresponded</a>
<a id='line_1301'>      with a perfidious baron, who proved unwilling, or unable, to open</a>
<a id='line_1302'>      the gates of the metropolis. The next spring, his favorite</a>
<a id='line_1303'>      general, Alexius Strategopulus, whom he had decorated with the</a>
<a id='line_1304'>      title of Cæsar, passed the Hellespont with eight hundred horse</a>
<a id='line_1305'>      and some infantry, 58 on a secret expedition. His instructions</a>
<a id='line_1306'>      enjoined him to approach, to listen, to watch, but not to risk</a>
<a id='line_1307'>      any doubtful or dangerous enterprise against the city. The</a>
<a id='line_1308'>      adjacent territory between the Propontis and the Black Sea was</a>
<a id='line_1309'>      cultivated by a hardy race of peasants and outlaws, exercised in</a>
<a id='line_1310'>      arms, uncertain in their allegiance, but inclined by language,</a>
<a id='line_1311'>      religion, and present advantage, to the party of the Greeks. They</a>
<a id='line_1312'>      were styled the _volunteers_; 59 and by their free service the</a>
<a id='line_1313'>      army of Alexius, with the regulars of Thrace and the Coman</a>
<a id='line_1314'>      auxiliaries, 60 was augmented to the number of five-and-twenty</a>
<a id='line_1315'>      thousand men. By the ardor of the volunteers, and by his own</a>
<a id='line_1316'>      ambition, the Cæsar was stimulated to disobey the precise orders</a>
<a id='line_1317'>      of his master, in the just confidence that success would plead</a>
<a id='line_1318'>      his pardon and reward. The weakness of Constantinople, and the</a>
<a id='line_1319'>      distress and terror of the Latins, were familiar to the</a>
<a id='line_1320'>      observation of the volunteers; and they represented the present</a>
<a id='line_1321'>      moment as the most propitious to surprise and conquest. A rash</a>
<a id='line_1322'>      youth, the new governor of the Venetian colony, had sailed away</a>
<a id='line_1323'>      with thirty galleys, and the best of the French knights, on a</a>
<a id='line_1324'>      wild expedition to Daphnusia, a town on the Black Sea, at the</a>
<a id='line_1325'>      distance of forty leagues; 601 and the remaining Latins were</a>
<a id='line_1326'>      without strength or suspicion. They were informed that Alexius</a>
<a id='line_1327'>      had passed the Hellespont; but their apprehensions were lulled by</a>
<a id='line_1328'>      the smallness of his original numbers; and their imprudence had</a>
<a id='line_1329'>      not watched the subsequent increase of his army. If he left his</a>
<a id='line_1330'>      main body to second and support his operations, he might advance</a>
<a id='line_1331'>      unperceived in the night with a chosen detachment. While some</a>
<a id='line_1332'>      applied scaling-ladders to the lowest part of the walls, they</a>
<a id='line_1333'>      were secure of an old Greek, who would introduce their companions</a>
<a id='line_1334'>      through a subterraneous passage into his house; they could soon</a>
<a id='line_1335'>      on the inside break an entrance through the golden gate, which</a>
<a id='line_1336'>      had been long obstructed; and the conqueror would be in the heart</a>
<a id='line_1337'>      of the city before the Latins were conscious of their danger.</a>
<a id='line_1338'>      After some debate, the Cæsar resigned himself to the faith of the</a>
<a id='line_1339'>      volunteers; they were trusty, bold, and successful; and in</a>
<a id='line_1340'>      describing the plan, I have already related the execution and</a>
<a id='line_1341'>      success. 61 But no sooner had Alexius passed the threshold of the</a>
<a id='line_1342'>      golden gate, than he trembled at his own rashness; he paused, he</a>
<a id='line_1343'>      deliberated; till the desperate volunteers urged him forwards, by</a>
<a id='line_1344'>      the assurance that in retreat lay the greatest and most</a>
<a id='line_1345'>      inevitable danger. Whilst the Cæsar kept his regulars in firm</a>
<a id='line_1346'>      array, the Comans dispersed themselves on all sides; an alarm was</a>
<a id='line_1347'>      sounded, and the threats of fire and pillage compelled the</a>
<a id='line_1348'>      citizens to a decisive resolution. The Greeks of Constantinople</a>
<a id='line_1349'>      remembered their native sovereigns; the Genoese merchants their</a>
<a id='line_1350'>      recent alliance and Venetian foes; every quarter was in arms; and</a>
<a id='line_1351'>      the air resounded with a general acclamation of “Long life and</a>
<a id='line_1352'>      victory to Michael and John, the august emperors of the Romans!”</a>
<a id='line_1353'>      Their rival, Baldwin, was awakened by the sound; but the most</a>
<a id='line_1354'>      pressing danger could not prompt him to draw his sword in the</a>
<a id='line_1355'>      defence of a city which he deserted, perhaps, with more pleasure</a>
<a id='line_1356'>      than regret: he fled from the palace to the seashore, where he</a>
<a id='line_1357'>      descried the welcome sails of the fleet returning from the vain</a>
<a id='line_1358'>      and fruitless attempt on Daphnusia. Constantinople was</a>
<a id='line_1359'>      irrecoverably lost; but the Latin emperor and the principal</a>
<a id='line_1360'>      families embarked on board the Venetian galleys, and steered for</a>
<a id='line_1361'>      the Isle of Euba, and afterwards for Italy, where the royal</a>
<a id='line_1362'>      fugitive was entertained by the pope and Sicilian king with a</a>
<a id='line_1363'>      mixture of contempt and pity. From the loss of Constantinople to</a>
<a id='line_1364'>      his death, he consumed thirteen years, soliciting the Catholic</a>
<a id='line_1365'>      powers to join in his restoration: the lesson had been familiar</a>
<a id='line_1366'>      to his youth; nor was his last exile more indigent or shameful</a>

<a id='line_1490'>      Latin votaries humbly accepted a corrupt and remote version, from</a>

<a id='line_1536'>      the eleventh century, the second tempest had subsided by the</a>

<a id='line_1542'>      the crusades; and some philosophers have applauded the propitious</a>
<a id='line_1543'>      influence of these holy wars, which appear to me to have checked</a>
<a id='line_1544'>      rather than forwarded the maturity of Europe. 69 The lives and</a>

<a id='line_1546'>      been more profitably employed in the improvement of their native</a>

<a id='line_1549'>      been enriched and enlightened by a pure and friendly</a>
<a id='line_1550'>      correspondence with the climates of the East. In one respect I</a>
<a id='line_1551'>      can indeed perceive the accidental operation of the crusades, not</a>
<a id='line_1552'>      so much in producing a benefit as in removing an evil. The larger</a>
<a id='line_1553'>      portion of the inhabitants of Europe was chained to the soil,</a>
<a id='line_1554'>      without freedom, or property, or knowledge; and the two orders of</a>
<a id='line_1555'>      ecclesiastics and nobles, whose numbers were comparatively small,</a>
<a id='line_1556'>      alone deserved the name of citizens and men. This oppressive</a>
<a id='line_1557'>      system was supported by the arts of the clergy and the swords of</a>
<a id='line_1558'>      the barons. The authority of the priests operated in the darker</a>
<a id='line_1559'>      ages as a salutary antidote: they prevented the total extinction</a>
<a id='line_1560'>      of letters, mitigated the fierceness of the times, sheltered the</a>
<a id='line_1561'>      poor and defenceless, and preserved or revived the peace and</a>

<a id='line_1564'>      every hope of industry and improvement was crushed by the iron</a>

<a id='line_1626'>      rays of light, 71 we discern the nobility and opulence of Atho, a</a>
<a id='line_1627'>      French knight; his nobility, in the rank and title of a nameless</a>
<a id='line_1628'>      father; his opulence, in the foundation of the castle of</a>
<a id='line_1629'>      Courtenay in the district of Gatinois, about fifty-six miles to</a>
<a id='line_1630'>      the south of Paris. From the reign of Robert, the son of Hugh</a>
<a id='line_1631'>      Capet, the barons of Courtenay are conspicuous among the</a>
<a id='line_1632'>      immediate vassals of the crown; and Joscelin, the grandson of</a>
<a id='line_1633'>      Atho and a noble dame, is enrolled among the heroes of the first</a>
<a id='line_1634'>      crusade. A domestic alliance (their mothers were sisters)</a>
<a id='line_1635'>      attached him to the standard of Baldwin of Bruges, the second</a>
<a id='line_1636'>      count of Edessa; a princely fief, which he was worthy to receive,</a>
<a id='line_1637'>      and able to maintain, announces the number of his martial</a>
<a id='line_1638'>      followers; and after the departure of his cousin, Joscelin</a>
<a id='line_1639'>      himself was invested with the county of Edessa on both sides of</a>
<a id='line_1640'>      the Euphrates. By economy in peace, his territories were</a>

<a id='line_1642'>      corn, wine, and oil; his castles with gold and silver, with arms</a>
<a id='line_1643'>      and horses. In a holy warfare of thirty years, he was alternately</a>
<a id='line_1644'>      a conqueror and a captive: but he died like a soldier, in a horse</a>
<a id='line_1645'>      litter at the head of his troops; and his last glance beheld the</a>
<a id='line_1646'>      flight of the Turkish invaders who had presumed on his age and</a>
<a id='line_1647'>      infirmities. His son and successor, of the same name, was less</a>
<a id='line_1648'>      deficient in valor than in vigilance; but he sometimes forgot</a>
<a id='line_1649'>      that dominion is acquired and maintained by the same arms. He</a>
<a id='line_1650'>      challenged the hostility of the Turks, without securing the</a>
<a id='line_1651'>      friendship of the prince of Antioch; and, amidst the peaceful</a>
<a id='line_1652'>      luxury of Turbessel, in Syria, 72 Joscelin neglected the defence</a>
<a id='line_1653'>      of the Christian frontier beyond the Euphrates. In his absence,</a>
<a id='line_1654'>      Zenghi, the first of the Atabeks, besieged and stormed his</a>
<a id='line_1655'>      capital, Edessa, which was feebly defended by a timorous and</a>
<a id='line_1656'>      disloyal crowd of Orientals: the Franks were oppressed in a bold</a>
<a id='line_1657'>      attempt for its recovery, and Courtenay ended his days in the</a>
<a id='line_1658'>      prison of Aleppo. He still left a fair and ample patrimony But</a>
<a id='line_1659'>      the victorious Turks oppressed on all sides the weakness of a</a>
<a id='line_1660'>      widow and orphan; and, for the equivalent of an annual pension,</a>
<a id='line_1661'>      they resigned to the Greek emperor the charge of defending, and</a>

<a id='line_1663'>      countess-dowager of Edessa retired to Jerusalem with her two</a>

<a id='line_1709'>      neglected, and finally denied; and the causes of their disgrace</a>
<a id='line_1710'>      will represent the story of this second branch. _1._ Of all the</a>
<a id='line_1711'>      families now extant, the most ancient, doubtless, and the most</a>
<a id='line_1712'>      illustrious, is the house of France, which has occupied the same</a>
<a id='line_1713'>      throne above eight hundred years, and descends, in a clear and</a>
<a id='line_1714'>      lineal series of males, from the middle of the ninth century. 75</a>
<a id='line_1715'>      In the age of the crusades, it was already revered both in the</a>
<a id='line_1716'>      East and West. But from Hugh Capet to the marriage of Peter, no</a>
<a id='line_1717'>      more than five reigns or generations had elapsed; and so</a>
<a id='line_1718'>      precarious was their title, that the eldest sons, as a necessary</a>
<a id='line_1719'>      precaution, were previously crowned during the lifetime of their</a>
<a id='line_1720'>      fathers. The peers of France have long maintained their</a>
<a id='line_1721'>      precedency before the younger branches of the royal line, nor had</a>
<a id='line_1722'>      the princes of the blood, in the twelfth century, acquired that</a>
<a id='line_1723'>      hereditary lustre which is now diffused over the most remote</a>
<a id='line_1724'>      candidates for the succession. _2._ The barons of Courtenay must</a>
<a id='line_1725'>      have stood high in their own estimation, and in that of the</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      world, since they could impose on the son of a king the</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      obligation of adopting for himself and all his descendants the</a>
<a id='line_1728'>      name and arms of their daughter and his wife. In the marriage of</a>
<a id='line_1729'>      an heiress with her inferior or her equal, such exchange was</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      often required and allowed: but as they continued to diverge from</a>

<a id='line_1856'>      the king’s son, Reginald of Courtenay abandoned his possessions</a>
<a id='line_1857'>      in France, and obtained from the English monarch a second wife</a>
<a id='line_1858'>      and a new inheritance. It is certain, at least, that Henry the</a>
<a id='line_1859'>      Second distinguished in his camps and councils a Reginald, of the</a>
<a id='line_1860'>      name and arms, and, as it may be fairly presumed, of the genuine</a>
<a id='line_1861'>      race, of the Courtenays of France. The right of wardship enabled</a>
<a id='line_1862'>      a feudal lord to reward his vassal with the marriage and estate</a>
<a id='line_1863'>      of a noble heiress; and Reginald of Courtenay acquired a fair</a>
<a id='line_1864'>      establishment in Devonshire, where his posterity has been seated</a>
<a id='line_1865'>      above six hundred years. 83 From a Norman baron, Baldwin de</a>
<a id='line_1866'>      Brioniis, who had been invested by the Conqueror, Hawise, the</a>
<a id='line_1867'>      wife of Reginald, derived the honor of Okehampton, which was held</a>
<a id='line_1868'>      by the service of ninety-three knights; and a female might claim</a>
<a id='line_1869'>      the manly offices of hereditary viscount or sheriff, and of</a>
<a id='line_1870'>      captain of the royal castle of Exeter. Their son Robert married</a>
<a id='line_1871'>      the sister of the earl of Devon: at the end of a century, on the</a>
<a id='line_1872'>      failure of the family of Rivers, 84 his great-grandson, Hugh the</a>
<a id='line_1873'>      Second, succeeded to a title which was still considered as a</a>
<a id='line_1874'>      territorial dignity; and twelve earls of Devonshire, of the name</a>
<a id='line_1875'>      of Courtenay, have flourished in a period of two hundred and</a>
<a id='line_1876'>      twenty years. They were ranked among the chief of the barons of</a>
<a id='line_1877'>      the realm; nor was it till after a strenuous dispute, that they</a>
<a id='line_1878'>      yielded to the fief of Arundel the first place in the parliament</a>
<a id='line_1879'>      of England: their alliances were contracted with the noblest</a>
<a id='line_1880'>      families, the Veres, Despensers, St. Johns, Talbots, Bohuns, and</a>
<a id='line_1881'>      even the Plantagenets themselves; and in a contest with John of</a>
<a id='line_1882'>      Lancaster, a Courtenay, bishop of London, and afterwards</a>
<a id='line_1883'>      archbishop of Canterbury, might be accused of profane confidence</a>
<a id='line_1884'>      in the strength and number of his kindred. In peace, the earls of</a>
<a id='line_1885'>      Devon resided in their numerous castles and manors of the west;</a>
<a id='line_1886'>      their ample revenue was appropriated to devotion and hospitality;</a>
<a id='line_1887'>      and the epitaph of Edward, surnamed from his misfortune, the</a>
<a id='line_1888'>      _blind_, from his virtues, the _good_, earl, inculcates with much</a>
<a id='line_1889'>      ingenuity a moral sentence, which may, however, be abused by</a>
<a id='line_1890'>      thoughtless generosity. After a grateful commemoration of the</a>
<a id='line_1891'>      fifty-five years of union and happiness which he enjoyed with</a>
<a id='line_1892'>      Mabe his wife, the good earl thus speaks from the tomb:—</a>
<a id='line_1893'></a>
<a id='line_1894'>     “What we gave, we have; What we spent, we had; What we left, we</a>
<a id='line_1895'>     lost.” 85</a>
<a id='line_1896'></a>
<a id='line_1897'>      But their _losses_, in this sense, were far superior to their</a>
<a id='line_1898'>      gifts and expenses; and their heirs, not less than the poor, were</a>
<a id='line_1899'>      the objects of their paternal care. The sums which they paid for</a>
<a id='line_1900'>      livery and seizin attest the greatness of their possessions; and</a>
<a id='line_1901'>      several estates have remained in their family since the</a>
<a id='line_1902'>      thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. In war, the Courtenays of</a>
<a id='line_1903'>      England fulfilled the duties, and deserved the honors, of</a>
<a id='line_1904'>      chivalry. They were often intrusted to levy and command the</a>
<a id='line_1905'>      militia of Devonshire and Cornwall; they often attended their</a>
<a id='line_1906'>      supreme lord to the borders of Scotland; and in foreign service,</a>
<a id='line_1907'>      for a stipulated price, they sometimes maintained fourscore</a>
<a id='line_1908'>      men-at-arms and as many archers. By sea and land they fought</a>
<a id='line_1909'>      under the standard of the Edwards and Henries: their names are</a>
<a id='line_1910'>      conspicuous in battles, in tournaments, and in the original list</a>
<a id='line_1911'>      of the Order of the Garter; three brothers shared the Spanish</a>
<a id='line_1912'>      victory of the Black Prince; and in the lapse of six generations,</a>
<a id='line_1913'>      the English Courtenays had learned to despise the nation and</a>
<a id='line_1914'>      country from which they derived their origin. In the quarrel of</a>
<a id='line_1915'>      the two roses, the earls of Devon adhered to the house of</a>
<a id='line_1916'>      Lancaster; and three brothers successively died either in the</a>
<a id='line_1917'>      field or on the scaffold. Their honors and estates were restored</a>
<a id='line_1918'>      by Henry the Seventh; a daughter of Edward the Fourth was not</a>
<a id='line_1919'>      disgraced by the nuptials of a Courtenay; their son, who was</a>
<a id='line_1920'>      created Marquis of Exeter, enjoyed the favor of his cousin Henry</a>
<a id='line_1921'>      the Eighth; and in the camp of Cloth of Gold, he broke a lance</a>
<a id='line_1922'>      against the French monarch. But the favor of Henry was the</a>
<a id='line_1923'>      prelude of disgrace; his disgrace was the signal of death; and of</a>
<a id='line_1924'>      the victims of the jealous tyrant, the marquis of Exeter is one</a>
<a id='line_1925'>      of the most noble and guiltless. His son Edward lived a prisoner</a>
<a id='line_1926'>      in the Tower, and died in exile at Padua; and the secret love of</a>
<a id='line_1927'>      Queen Mary, whom he slighted, perhaps for the princess Elizabeth,</a>
<a id='line_1928'>      has shed a romantic color on the story of this beautiful youth.</a>
<a id='line_1929'>      The relics of his patrimony were conveyed into strange families</a>
<a id='line_1930'>      by the marriages of his four aunts; and his personal honors, as</a>
<a id='line_1931'>      if they had been legally extinct, were revived by the patents of</a>
<a id='line_1932'>      succeeding princes. But there still survived a lineal descendant</a>
<a id='line_1933'>      of Hugh, the first earl of Devon, a younger branch of the</a>
<a id='line_1934'>      Courtenays, who have been seated at Powderham Castle above four</a>
