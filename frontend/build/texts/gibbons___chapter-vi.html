<a id='line_10'>      its own powers: but the possession of a throne could never yet</a>
<a id='line_11'>      afford a lasting satisfaction to an ambitious mind. This</a>
<a id='line_12'>      melancholy truth was felt and acknowledged by Severus. Fortune</a>
<a id='line_13'>      and merit had, from an humble station, elevated him to the first</a>
<a id='line_14'>      place among mankind. “He had been all things,” as he said</a>
<a id='line_15'>      himself, “and all was of little value.” 1 Distracted with the</a>
<a id='line_16'>      care, not of acquiring, but of preserving an empire, oppressed</a>
<a id='line_17'>      with age and infirmities, careless of fame, 2 and satiated with</a>
<a id='line_18'>      power, all his prospects of life were closed. The desire of</a>
<a id='line_19'>      perpetuating the greatness of his family was the only remaining</a>
<a id='line_20'>      wish of his ambition and paternal tenderness.</a>

<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'>      Like most of the Africans, Severus was passionately addicted to</a>
<a id='line_27'>      the vain studies of magic and divination, deeply versed in the</a>
<a id='line_28'>      interpretation of dreams and omens, and perfectly acquainted with</a>
<a id='line_29'>      the science of judicial astrology; which, in almost every age</a>
<a id='line_30'>      except the present, has maintained its dominion over the mind of</a>
<a id='line_31'>      man. He had lost his first wife, while he was governor of the</a>
<a id='line_32'>      Lionnese Gaul. 3 In the choice of a second, he sought only to</a>
<a id='line_33'>      connect himself with some favorite of fortune; and as soon as he</a>
<a id='line_34'>      had discovered that the young lady of Emesa in Syria had _a royal</a>
<a id='line_35'>      nativity_, he solicited and obtained her hand. 4 Julia Domna (for</a>
<a id='line_36'>      that was her name) deserved all that the stars could promise her.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>      She possessed, even in advanced age, the attractions of beauty, 5</a>
<a id='line_39'>      and united to a lively imagination a firmness of mind, and</a>
<a id='line_40'>      strength of judgment, seldom bestowed on her sex. Her amiable</a>
<a id='line_41'>      qualities never made any deep impression on the dark and jealous</a>
<a id='line_42'>      temper of her husband; but in her son’s reign, she administered</a>
<a id='line_43'>      the principal affairs of the empire, with a prudence that</a>
<a id='line_44'>      supported his authority, and with a moderation that sometimes</a>
<a id='line_45'>      corrected his wild extravagancies. 6 Julia applied herself to</a>
<a id='line_46'>      letters and philosophy, with some success, and with the most</a>
<a id='line_47'>      splendid reputation. She was the patroness of every art, and the</a>
<a id='line_48'>      friend of every man of genius. 7 The grateful flattery of the</a>
<a id='line_49'>      learned has celebrated her virtues; but, if we may credit the</a>
<a id='line_50'>      scandal of ancient history, chastity was very far from being the</a>
<a id='line_51'>      most conspicuous virtue of the empress Julia. 8</a>

<a id='line_76'>      father, and of the Roman world, were soon disappointed by these</a>
<a id='line_77'>      vain youths, who displayed the indolent security of hereditary</a>
<a id='line_78'>      princes; and a presumption that fortune would supply the place of</a>
<a id='line_79'>      merit and application. Without any emulation of virtue or</a>
<a id='line_80'>      talents, they discovered, almost from their infancy, a fixed and</a>
<a id='line_81'>      implacable antipathy for each other.</a>

<a id='line_86'>      ancient historians. After his death, the public indignation</a>
<a id='line_87'>      loaded him with the nicknames of Tarantus and Caracalla. The</a>
<a id='line_88'>      first was borrowed from a celebrated Gladiator, the second from a</a>
<a id='line_89'>      long Gallic gown which he distributed to the people of Rome.]</a>
<a id='line_90'></a>
<a id='line_91'>      Their aversion, confirmed by years, and fomented by the arts of</a>
<a id='line_92'>      their interested favorites, broke out in childish, and gradually</a>
<a id='line_93'>      in more serious competitions; and, at length, divided the</a>
<a id='line_94'>      theatre, the circus, and the court, into two factions, actuated</a>
<a id='line_95'>      by the hopes and fears of their respective leaders. The prudent</a>
<a id='line_96'>      emperor endeavored, by every expedient of advice and authority,</a>
<a id='line_97'>      to allay this growing animosity. The unhappy discord of his sons</a>
<a id='line_98'>      clouded all his prospects, and threatened to overturn a throne</a>
<a id='line_99'>      raised with so much labor, cemented with so much blood, and</a>
<a id='line_100'>      guarded with every defence of arms and treasure. With an</a>
<a id='line_101'>      impartial hand he maintained between them an exact balance of</a>
<a id='line_102'>      favor, conferred on both the rank of Augustus, with the revered</a>
<a id='line_103'>      name of Antoninus; and for the first time the Roman world beheld</a>
<a id='line_104'>      three emperors. 10 Yet even this equal conduct served only to</a>
<a id='line_105'>      inflame the contest, whilst the fierce Caracalla asserted the</a>
<a id='line_106'>      right of primogeniture, and the milder Geta courted the</a>
<a id='line_107'>      affections of the people and the soldiers. In the anguish of a</a>
<a id='line_108'>      disappointed father, Severus foretold that the weaker of his sons</a>
<a id='line_109'>      would fall a sacrifice to the stronger; who, in his turn, would</a>
<a id='line_110'>      be ruined by his own vices. 11</a>

<a id='line_118'></a>
<a id='line_119'>      In these circumstances the intelligence of a war in Britain, and</a>
<a id='line_120'>      of an invasion of the province by the barbarians of the North,</a>
<a id='line_121'>      was received with pleasure by Severus. Though the vigilance of</a>
<a id='line_122'>      his lieutenants might have been sufficient to repel the distant</a>
<a id='line_123'>      enemy, he resolved to embrace the honorable pretext of</a>
<a id='line_124'>      withdrawing his sons from the luxury of Rome, which enervated</a>
<a id='line_125'>      their minds and irritated their passions; and of inuring their</a>
<a id='line_126'>      youth to the toils of war and government. Notwithstanding his</a>
<a id='line_127'>      advanced age, (for he was above threescore,) and his gout, which</a>
<a id='line_128'>      obliged him to be carried in a litter, he transported himself in</a>
<a id='line_129'>      person into that remote island, attended by his two sons, his</a>
<a id='line_130'>      whole court, and a formidable army. He immediately passed the</a>
<a id='line_131'>      walls of Hadrian and Antoninus, and entered the enemy’s country,</a>
<a id='line_132'>      with a design of completing the long attempted conquest of</a>
<a id='line_133'>      Britain. He penetrated to the northern extremity of the island,</a>
<a id='line_134'>      without meeting an enemy. But the concealed ambuscades of the</a>
<a id='line_135'>      Caledonians, who hung unseen on the rear and flanks of his army,</a>
<a id='line_136'>      the coldness of the climate and the severity of a winter march</a>
<a id='line_137'>      across the hills and morasses of Scotland, are reported to have</a>
<a id='line_138'>      cost the Romans above fifty thousand men. The Caledonians at</a>
<a id='line_139'>      length yielded to the powerful and obstinate attack, sued for</a>
<a id='line_140'>      peace, and surrendered a part of their arms, and a large tract of</a>
<a id='line_141'>      territory. But their apparent submission lasted no longer than</a>
<a id='line_142'>      the present terror. As soon as the Roman legions had retired,</a>
<a id='line_143'>      they resumed their hostile independence. Their restless spirit</a>
<a id='line_144'>      provoked Severus to send a new army into Caledonia, with the most</a>
<a id='line_145'>      bloody orders, not to subdue, but to extirpate the natives. They</a>
<a id='line_146'>      were saved by the death of their haughty enemy. 12</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>      12 (return) [ Dion, l. lxxvi. p. 1280, &c. Herodian, l. iii. p.</a>
<a id='line_149'>      132, &c.]</a>
<a id='line_150'></a>
<a id='line_151'>      This Caledonian war, neither marked by decisive events, nor</a>
<a id='line_152'>      attended with any important consequences, would ill deserve our</a>
<a id='line_153'>      attention; but it is supposed, not without a considerable degree</a>
<a id='line_154'>      of probability, that the invasion of Severus is connected with</a>
<a id='line_155'>      the most shining period of the British history or fable. Fingal,</a>
<a id='line_156'>      whose fame, with that of his heroes and bards, has been revived</a>
<a id='line_157'>      in our language by a recent publication, is said to have</a>
<a id='line_158'>      commanded the Caledonians in that memorable juncture, to have</a>
<a id='line_159'>      eluded the power of Severus, and to have obtained a signal</a>
<a id='line_160'>      victory on the banks of the Carun, in which the son of _the King</a>
<a id='line_161'>      of the World_, Caracul, fled from his arms along the fields of</a>
<a id='line_162'>      his pride. 13 Something of a doubtful mist still hangs over these</a>
<a id='line_163'>      Highland traditions; nor can it be entirely dispelled by the most</a>
<a id='line_164'>      ingenious researches of modern criticism; 14 but if we could,</a>
<a id='line_165'>      with safety, indulge the pleasing supposition, that Fingal lived,</a>
<a id='line_166'>      and that Ossian sung, the striking contrast of the situation and</a>
<a id='line_167'>      manners of the contending nations might amuse a philosophic mind.</a>
<a id='line_168'></a>
<a id='line_169'>      The parallel would be little to the advantage of the more</a>
<a id='line_170'>      civilized people, if we compared the unrelenting revenge of</a>
<a id='line_171'>      Severus with the generous clemency of Fingal; the timid and</a>
<a id='line_172'>      brutal cruelty of Caracalla with the bravery, the tenderness, the</a>
<a id='line_173'>      elegant genius of Ossian; the mercenary chiefs, who, from motives</a>
<a id='line_174'>      of fear or interest, served under the imperial standard, with the</a>
<a id='line_175'>      free-born warriors who started to arms at the voice of the king</a>
<a id='line_176'>      of Morven; if, in a word, we contemplated the untutored</a>
<a id='line_177'>      Caledonians, glowing with the warm virtues of nature, and the</a>
<a id='line_178'>      degenerate Romans, polluted with the mean vices of wealth and</a>
<a id='line_179'>      slavery.</a>

<a id='line_183'>      14 (return) [ That the Caracul of Ossian is the Caracalla of the</a>
<a id='line_184'>      Roman History, is, perhaps, the only point of British antiquity</a>
<a id='line_185'>      in which Mr. Macpherson and Mr. Whitaker are of the same opinion;</a>
<a id='line_186'>      and yet the opinion is not without difficulty. In the Caledonian</a>
<a id='line_187'>      war, the son of Severus was known only by the appellation of</a>
<a id='line_188'>      Antoninus, and it may seem strange that the Highland bard should</a>
<a id='line_189'>      describe him by a nickname, invented four years afterwards,</a>
<a id='line_190'>      scarcely used by the Romans till after the death of that emperor,</a>
<a id='line_191'>      and seldom employed by the most ancient historians. See Dion, l.</a>

<a id='line_193'>      Chron. ad ann. 214. Note: The historical authority of</a>
<a id='line_194'>      Macpherson’s Ossian has not increased since Gibbon wrote. We may,</a>
<a id='line_195'>      indeed, consider it exploded. Mr. Whitaker, in a letter to Gibbon</a>
<a id='line_196'>      (Misc. Works, vol. ii. p. 100,) attempts, not very successfully,</a>
<a id='line_197'>      to weaken this objection of the historian.—M.]</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>      The declining health and last illness of Severus inflamed the</a>
<a id='line_200'>      wild ambition and black passions of Caracalla’s soul. Impatient</a>
<a id='line_201'>      of any delay or division of empire, he attempted, more than once,</a>
<a id='line_202'>      to shorten the small remainder of his father’s days, and</a>
<a id='line_203'>      endeavored, but without success, to excite a mutiny among the</a>
<a id='line_204'>      troops. 15 The old emperor had often censured the misguided</a>
<a id='line_205'>      lenity of Marcus, who, by a single act of justice, might have</a>
<a id='line_206'>      saved the Romans from the tyranny of his worthless son. Placed in</a>
<a id='line_207'>      the same situation, he experienced how easily the rigor of a</a>
<a id='line_208'>      judge dissolves away in the tenderness of a parent. He</a>
<a id='line_209'>      deliberated, he threatened, but he could not punish; and this</a>
<a id='line_210'>      last and only instance of mercy was more fatal to the empire than</a>
<a id='line_211'>      a long series of cruelty. 16 The disorder of his mind irritated</a>
<a id='line_212'>      the pains of his body; he wished impatiently for death, and</a>
<a id='line_213'>      hastened the instant of it by his impatience. He expired at York</a>
<a id='line_214'>      in the sixty-fifth year of his life, and in the eighteenth of a</a>
<a id='line_215'>      glorious and successful reign. In his last moments he recommended</a>
<a id='line_216'>      concord to his sons, and his sons to the army. The salutary</a>
<a id='line_217'>      advice never reached the heart, or even the understanding, of the</a>
<a id='line_218'>      impetuous youths; but the more obedient troops, mindful of their</a>
<a id='line_219'>      oath of allegiance, and of the authority of their deceased</a>
<a id='line_220'>      master, resisted the solicitations of Caracalla, and proclaimed</a>
<a id='line_221'>      both brothers emperors of Rome. The new princes soon left the</a>
<a id='line_222'>      Caledonians in peace, returned to the capital, celebrated their</a>
<a id='line_223'>      father’s funeral with divine honors, and were cheerfully</a>
<a id='line_224'>      acknowledged as lawful sovereigns, by the senate, the people, and</a>
<a id='line_225'>      the provinces. Some preeminence of rank seems to have been</a>
<a id='line_226'>      allowed to the elder brother; but they both administered the</a>

<a id='line_260'>      region of the Palatine Mount, on which it was built, occupied, at</a>

<a id='line_265'>      greatest part of which had been gradually confiscated by the</a>

<a id='line_267'>      the Janiculum, and if Caracalla inhabited the gardens of Mæcenas</a>
<a id='line_268'>      on the Esquiline, the rival brothers were separated from each</a>

<a id='line_280'>      This latent civil war already distracted the whole government,</a>
<a id='line_281'>      when a scheme was suggested that seemed of mutual benefit to the</a>
<a id='line_282'>      hostile brothers. It was proposed, that since it was impossible</a>
<a id='line_283'>      to reconcile their minds, they should separate their interest,</a>
<a id='line_284'>      and divide the empire between them. The conditions of the treaty</a>
<a id='line_285'>      were already drawn with some accuracy. It was agreed that</a>
<a id='line_286'>      Caracalla, as the elder brother should remain in possession of</a>
<a id='line_287'>      Europe and the western Africa; and that he should relinquish the</a>
<a id='line_288'>      sovereignty of Asia and Egypt to Geta, who might fix his</a>
<a id='line_289'>      residence at Alexandria or Antioch, cities little inferior to</a>
<a id='line_290'>      Rome itself in wealth and greatness; that numerous armies should</a>
<a id='line_291'>      be constantly encamped on either side of the Thracian Bosphorus,</a>
<a id='line_292'>      to guard the frontiers of the rival monarchies; and that the</a>
<a id='line_293'>      senators of European extraction should acknowledge the sovereign</a>
<a id='line_294'>      of Rome, whilst the natives of Asia followed the emperor of the</a>

<a id='line_298'>      intimately united by the hand of time and policy, that it</a>
<a id='line_299'>      required the most forcible violence to rend it asunder. The</a>

<a id='line_301'>      soon be reduced by a civil war under the dominion of one master;</a>
<a id='line_302'>      but if the separation was permanent, the division of the</a>

<a id='line_308'>      Had the treaty been carried into execution, the sovereign of</a>
<a id='line_309'>      Europe might soon have been the conqueror of Asia; but Caracalla</a>
<a id='line_310'>      obtained an easier, though a more guilty, victory. He artfully</a>
<a id='line_311'>      listened to his mother’s entreaties, and consented to meet his</a>
<a id='line_312'>      brother in her apartment, on terms of peace and reconciliation.</a>
<a id='line_313'>      In the midst of their conversation, some centurions, who had</a>
<a id='line_314'>      contrived to conceal themselves, rushed with drawn swords upon</a>
<a id='line_315'>      the unfortunate Geta. His distracted mother strove to protect him</a>

<a id='line_318'>      she saw the elder animating and assisting 21 the fury of the</a>
<a id='line_319'>      assassins. As soon as the deed was perpetrated, Caracalla, with</a>
<a id='line_320'>      hasty steps, and horror in his countenance, ran towards the</a>
<a id='line_321'>      Prætorian camp, as his only refuge, and threw himself on the</a>
<a id='line_322'>      ground before the statues of the tutelar deities. 22 The soldiers</a>
<a id='line_323'>      attempted to raise and comfort him. In broken and disordered</a>

<a id='line_328'>      complaint was useless, revenge was dangerous, and they still</a>
<a id='line_329'>      reverenced the son of Severus. Their discontent died away in idle</a>
<a id='line_330'>      murmurs, and Caracalla soon convinced them of the justice of his</a>
<a id='line_331'>      cause, by distributing in one lavish donative the accumulated</a>
<a id='line_332'>      treasures of his father’s reign. 23 The real _sentiments_ of the</a>

<a id='line_556'>      remembered and abused by Caracalla. “To secure the affections of</a>

<a id='line_580'>      extraordinary gifts of Caracalla to the army amounted annually to</a>
<a id='line_581'>      seventy millions of drachmæ (about two millions three hundred and</a>
<a id='line_582'>      fifty thousand pounds.) There is another passage in Dion,</a>
<a id='line_583'>      concerning the military pay, infinitely curious, were it not</a>
<a id='line_584'>      obscure, imperfect, and probably corrupt. The best sense seems to</a>
<a id='line_585'>      be, that the Prætorian guards received twelve hundred and fifty</a>
<a id='line_586'>      drachmæ, (forty pounds a year,) (Dion, l. lxxvii. p. 1307.) Under</a>
<a id='line_587'>      the reign of Augustus, they were paid at the rate of two drachmæ,</a>
<a id='line_588'>      or denarii, per day, 720 a year, (Tacit. Annal. i. 17.) Domitian,</a>
<a id='line_589'>      who increased the soldiers’ pay one fourth, must have raised the</a>
<a id='line_590'>      Prætorians to 960 drachmæ, (Gronoviue de Pecunia Veteri, l. iii.</a>
<a id='line_591'>      c. 2.) These successive augmentations ruined the empire; for,</a>
<a id='line_592'>      with the soldiers’ pay, their numbers too were increased. We have</a>
<a id='line_593'>      seen the Prætorians alone increased from 10,000 to 50,000 men.</a>
<a id='line_594'>      Note: Valois and Reimar have explained in a very simple and</a>
<a id='line_595'>      probable manner this passage of Dion, which Gibbon seems to me</a>
<a id='line_596'>      not to have understood. He ordered that the soldiers should</a>
<a id='line_597'>      receive, as the reward of their services the Prætorians 1250</a>
<a id='line_598'>      drachms, the other 5000 drachms. Valois thinks that the numbers</a>
<a id='line_599'>      have been transposed, and that Caracalla added 5000 drachms to</a>
<a id='line_600'>      the donations made to the Prætorians, 1250 to those of the</a>
<a id='line_601'>      legionaries. The Prætorians, in fact, always received more than</a>
<a id='line_602'>      the others. The error of Gibbon arose from his considering that</a>
<a id='line_603'>      this referred to the annual pay of the soldiers, while it relates</a>
<a id='line_604'>      to the sum they received as a reward for their services on their</a>
<a id='line_605'>      discharge: donatives means recompense for service. Augustus had</a>
<a id='line_606'>      settled that the Prætorians, after sixteen campaigns, should</a>
<a id='line_607'>      receive 5000 drachms: the legionaries received only 3000 after</a>
<a id='line_608'>      twenty years. Caracalla added 5000 drachms to the donative of the</a>
<a id='line_609'>      Prætorians, 1250 to that of the legionaries. Gibbon appears to</a>
<a id='line_610'>      have been mistaken both in confounding this donative on discharge</a>
<a id='line_611'>      with the annual pay, and in not paying attention to the remark of</a>
<a id='line_612'>      Valois on the transposition of the numbers in the text.—G]</a>
<a id='line_613'></a>
<a id='line_614'>      It was impossible that such a character, and such conduct as that</a>
<a id='line_615'>      of Caracalla, could inspire either love or esteem; but as long as</a>
<a id='line_616'>      his vices were beneficial to the armies, he was secure from the</a>
<a id='line_617'>      danger of rebellion. A secret conspiracy, provoked by his own</a>
<a id='line_618'>      jealousy, was fatal to the tyrant. The Prætorian præfecture was</a>
<a id='line_619'>      divided between two ministers. The military department was</a>
<a id='line_620'>      intrusted to Adventus, an experienced rather than able soldier;</a>
<a id='line_621'>      and the civil affairs were transacted by Opilius Macrinus, who,</a>
<a id='line_622'>      by his dexterity in business, had raised himself, with a fair</a>
<a id='line_623'>      character, to that high office. But his favor varied with the</a>
<a id='line_624'>      caprice of the emperor, and his life might depend on the</a>
<a id='line_625'>      slightest suspicion, or the most casual circumstance. Malice or</a>
<a id='line_626'>      fanaticism had suggested to an African, deeply skilled in the</a>
<a id='line_627'>      knowledge of futurity, a very dangerous prediction, that Macrinus</a>
<a id='line_628'>      and his son were destined to reign over the empire. The report</a>
<a id='line_629'>      was soon diffused through the province; and when the man was sent</a>
<a id='line_630'>      in chains to Rome, he still asserted, in the presence of the</a>
<a id='line_631'>      præfect of the city, the faith of his prophecy. That magistrate,</a>
<a id='line_632'>      who had received the most pressing instructions to inform himself</a>
<a id='line_633'>      of the _successors_ of Caracalla, immediately communicated the</a>
<a id='line_634'>      examination of the African to the Imperial court, which at that</a>
<a id='line_635'>      time resided in Syria. But, notwithstanding the diligence of the</a>
<a id='line_636'>      public messengers, a friend of Macrinus found means to apprise</a>
<a id='line_637'>      him of the approaching danger. The emperor received the letters</a>
<a id='line_638'>      from Rome; and as he was then engaged in the conduct of a chariot</a>
<a id='line_639'>      race, he delivered them unopened to the Prætorian Præfect,</a>
<a id='line_640'>      directing him to despatch the ordinary affairs, and to report the</a>
<a id='line_641'>      more important business that might be contained in them. Macrinus</a>
<a id='line_642'>      read his fate, and resolved to prevent it. He inflamed the</a>
<a id='line_643'>      discontents of some inferior officers, and employed the hand of</a>
<a id='line_644'>      Martialis, a desperate soldier, who had been refused the rank of</a>
<a id='line_645'>      centurion. The devotion of Caracalla prompted him to make a</a>
<a id='line_646'>      pilgrimage from Edessa to the celebrated temple of the Moon at</a>
<a id='line_647'>      Carrhæ. 381 He was attended by a body of cavalry: but having</a>
<a id='line_648'>      stopped on the road for some necessary occasion, his guards</a>
<a id='line_649'>      preserved a respectful distance, and Martialis, approaching his</a>
<a id='line_650'>      person under a presence of duty, stabbed him with a dagger. The</a>
<a id='line_651'>      bold assassin was instantly killed by a Scythian archer of the</a>
<a id='line_652'>      Imperial guard. Such was the end of a monster whose life</a>
<a id='line_653'>      disgraced human nature, and whose reign accused the patience of</a>
<a id='line_654'>      the Romans. 39 The grateful soldiers forgot his vices, remembered</a>
<a id='line_655'>      only his partial liberality, and obliged the senate to prostitute</a>
<a id='line_656'>      their own dignity and that of religion, by granting him a place</a>
<a id='line_657'>      among the gods. Whilst he was upon earth, Alexander the Great was</a>
<a id='line_658'>      the only hero whom this god deemed worthy his admiration. He</a>
<a id='line_659'>      assumed the name and ensigns of Alexander, formed a Macedonian</a>

<a id='line_769'>      fatal secret of the conspiracy against the late emperor,</a>
<a id='line_770'>      aggravated the guilt of murder by the baseness of hypocrisy, and</a>
<a id='line_771'>      heightened contempt by detestation. To alienate the soldiers, and</a>
<a id='line_772'>      to provoke inevitable ruin, the character of a reformer was only</a>
<a id='line_773'>      wanting; and such was the peculiar hardship of his fate, that</a>
<a id='line_774'>      Macrinus was compelled to exercise that invidious office. The</a>
<a id='line_775'>      prodigality of Caracalla had left behind it a long train of ruin</a>
<a id='line_776'>      and disorder; and if that worthless tyrant had been capable of</a>

<a id='line_780'></a>
<a id='line_781'>      In the management of this necessary reformation, Macrinus</a>
<a id='line_782'>      proceeded with a cautious prudence, which would have restored</a>
<a id='line_783'>      health and vigor to the Roman army in an easy and almost</a>
<a id='line_784'>      imperceptible manner. To the soldiers already engaged in the</a>
<a id='line_785'>      service, he was constrained to leave the dangerous privileges and</a>
<a id='line_786'>      extravagant pay given by Caracalla; but the new recruits were</a>
<a id='line_787'>      received on the more moderate though liberal establishment of</a>
<a id='line_788'>      Severus, and gradually formed to modesty and obedience. 45 One</a>
<a id='line_789'>      fatal error destroyed the salutary effects of this judicious</a>
<a id='line_790'>      plan. The numerous army, assembled in the East by the late</a>
<a id='line_791'>      emperor, instead of being immediately dispersed by Macrinus</a>
<a id='line_792'>      through the several provinces, was suffered to remain united in</a>
<a id='line_793'>      Syria, during the winter that followed his elevation. In the</a>
<a id='line_794'>      luxurious idleness of their quarters, the troops viewed their</a>
<a id='line_795'>      strength and numbers, communicated their complaints, and revolved</a>
<a id='line_796'>      in their minds the advantages of another revolution. The</a>
<a id='line_797'>      veterans, instead of being flattered by the advantageous</a>
<a id='line_798'>      distinction, were alarmed by the first steps of the emperor,</a>
<a id='line_799'>      which they considered as the presage of his future intentions.</a>
<a id='line_800'>      The recruits, with sullen reluctance, entered on a service, whose</a>
<a id='line_801'>      labors were increased while its rewards were diminished by a</a>

<a id='line_803'>      with impunity into seditious clamors; and the partial mutinies</a>
<a id='line_804'>      betrayed a spirit of discontent and disaffection that waited only</a>
<a id='line_805'>      for the slightest occasion to break out on every side into a</a>

<a id='line_824'>      from the anxious and humiliating dependence. 46 461 Julia Mæsa,</a>

<a id='line_831'>      holy vocation, embraced either from prudence or superstition,</a>

<a id='line_834'>      discipline of Macrinus had constrained them to pass the winter</a>
<a id='line_835'>      encamped, they were eager to revenge the cruelty of such</a>

<a id='line_1272'>      aspired, indeed, to share the honors of the empire which she had</a>
<a id='line_1273'>      conferred on her son; but her mad ambition, detested by every</a>

<a id='line_1275'>      artful firmness of Seneca and Burrhus. 65 The good sense, or the</a>
<a id='line_1276'>      indifference, of succeeding princes, restrained them from</a>
<a id='line_1277'>      offending the prejudices of their subjects; and it was reserved</a>

<a id='line_1387'>      reverence of posterity. But as he deemed the service of mankind</a>
<a id='line_1388'>      the most acceptable worship of the gods, the greatest part of his</a>
<a id='line_1389'>      morning hours was employed in his council, where he discussed</a>

<a id='line_1392'>      relieved by the charms of literature; and a portion of time was</a>
<a id='line_1393'>      always set apart for his favorite studies of poetry, history, and</a>
<a id='line_1394'>      philosophy. The works of Virgil and Horace, the republics of</a>
<a id='line_1395'>      Plato and Cicero, formed his taste, enlarged his understanding,</a>
<a id='line_1396'>      and gave him the noblest ideas of man and government. The</a>

<a id='line_1517'>      restrained within the limits of reason and justice, they soon</a>
<a id='line_1518'>      were more dissatisfied with the virtues of Alexander, than they</a>
<a id='line_1519'>      had ever been with the vices of Elagabalus. Their præfect, the</a>
<a id='line_1520'>      wise Ulpian, was the friend of the laws and of the people; he was</a>
<a id='line_1521'>      considered as the enemy of the soldiers, and to his pernicious</a>
<a id='line_1522'>      counsels every scheme of reformation was imputed. Some trifling</a>
<a id='line_1523'>      accident blew up their discontent into a furious mutiny; and the</a>
<a id='line_1524'>      civil war raged, during three days, in Rome, whilst the life of</a>
<a id='line_1525'>      that excellent minister was defended by the grateful people.</a>
<a id='line_1526'>      Terrified, at length, by the sight of some houses in flames, and</a>
<a id='line_1527'>      by the threats of a general conflagration, the people yielded</a>
<a id='line_1528'>      with a sigh, and left the virtuous but unfortunate Ulpian to his</a>
<a id='line_1529'>      fate. He was pursued into the Imperial palace, and massacred at</a>
<a id='line_1530'>      the feet of his master, who vainly strove to cover him with the</a>
<a id='line_1531'>      purple, and to obtain his pardon from the inexorable soldiers.</a>
<a id='line_1532'>      731 Such was the deplorable weakness of government, that the</a>
<a id='line_1533'>      emperor was unable to revenge his murdered friend and his</a>
<a id='line_1534'>      insulted dignity, without stooping to the arts of patience and</a>
<a id='line_1535'>      dissimulation. Epagathus, the principal leader of the mutiny, was</a>
<a id='line_1536'>      removed from Rome, by the honorable employment of præfect of</a>
<a id='line_1537'>      Egypt: from that high rank he was gently degraded to the</a>
<a id='line_1538'>      government of Crete; and when at length, his popularity among the</a>
<a id='line_1539'>      guards was effaced by time and absence, Alexander ventured to</a>
<a id='line_1540'>      inflict the tardy but deserved punishment of his crimes. 74 Under</a>
<a id='line_1541'>      the reign of a just and virtuous prince, the tyranny of the army</a>
<a id='line_1542'>      threatened with instant death his most faithful ministers, who</a>

<a id='line_1546'>      Rome, embracing the common cause of military license, demanded</a>
<a id='line_1547'>      the head of the reformer. Alexander, however, instead of yielding</a>
<a id='line_1548'>      to their seditious clamors, showed a just sense of his merit and</a>
<a id='line_1549'>      services, by appointing him his colleague in the consulship, and</a>
<a id='line_1550'>      defraying from his own treasury the expense of that vain dignity:</a>

<a id='line_1621'>      Germans, and the Sarmatians. Be silent in the presence of your</a>

<a id='line_2011'>      _per cent_.; but it comprehended whatever was sold in the markets</a>
<a id='line_2012'>      or by public auction, from the most considerable purchases of</a>

<a id='line_2015'>      tax, as it affects the body of the people, has ever been the</a>
<a id='line_2016'>      occasion of clamor and discontent. An emperor well acquainted</a>
<a id='line_2017'>      with the wants and resources of the state was obliged to declare,</a>
<a id='line_2018'>      by a public edict, that the support of the army depended in a</a>
<a id='line_2019'>      great measure on the produce of the excise. 101</a>

<a id='line_2026'>      III. When Augustus resolved to establish a permanent military</a>
<a id='line_2027'>      force for the defence of his government against foreign and</a>
<a id='line_2028'>      domestic enemies, he instituted a peculiar treasury for the pay</a>
<a id='line_2029'>      of the soldiers, the rewards of the veterans, and the</a>
<a id='line_2030'>      extra-ordinary expenses of war. The ample revenue of the excise,</a>
<a id='line_2031'>      though peculiarly appropriated to those uses, was found</a>
<a id='line_2032'>      inadequate. To supply the deficiency, the emperor suggested a new</a>
<a id='line_2033'>      tax of five per cent. on all legacies and inheritances. But the</a>
<a id='line_2034'>      nobles of Rome were more tenacious of property than of freedom.</a>
<a id='line_2035'>      Their indignant murmurs were received by Augustus with his usual</a>
<a id='line_2036'>      temper. He candidly referred the whole business to the senate,</a>
<a id='line_2037'>      and exhorted them to provide for the public service by some other</a>
<a id='line_2038'>      expedient of a less odious nature. They were divided and</a>
<a id='line_2039'>      perplexed. He insinuated to them, that their obstinacy would</a>
<a id='line_2040'>      oblige him to _propose_ a general land tax and capitation. They</a>
<a id='line_2041'>      acquiesced in silence. 102 The new imposition on legacies and</a>
<a id='line_2042'>      inheritances was, however, mitigated by some restrictions. It did</a>
<a id='line_2043'>      not take place unless the object was of a certain value, most</a>
<a id='line_2044'>      probably of fifty or a hundred pieces of gold; 103 nor could it</a>
<a id='line_2045'>      be exacted from the nearest of kin on the father’s side. 104 When</a>
<a id='line_2046'>      the rights of nature and poverty were thus secured, it seemed</a>
<a id='line_2047'>      reasonable, that a stranger, or a distant relation, who acquired</a>
<a id='line_2048'>      an unexpected accession of fortune, should cheerfully resign a</a>
