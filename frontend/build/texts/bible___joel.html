<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.</a>
<a id='line_4'></a>
<a id='line_5'>1:2 Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land.</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers?  1:3</a>
<a id='line_8'>Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their</a>
<a id='line_9'>children, and their children another generation.</a>
<a id='line_10'></a>
<a id='line_11'>1:4 That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and</a>
<a id='line_12'>that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and that</a>
<a id='line_13'>which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller eaten.</a>
<a id='line_14'></a>
<a id='line_15'>1:5 Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of wine,</a>
<a id='line_16'>because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.</a>
<a id='line_17'></a>
<a id='line_18'>1:6 For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without number,</a>
<a id='line_19'>whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek teeth of a</a>
<a id='line_20'>great lion.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>1:7 He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath made</a>
<a id='line_23'>it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are made white.</a>
<a id='line_24'></a>
<a id='line_25'>1:8 Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her</a>
<a id='line_26'>youth.</a>
<a id='line_27'></a>
<a id='line_28'>1:9 The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house</a>
<a id='line_29'>of the LORD; the priests, the LORDâ€™s ministers, mourn.</a>
<a id='line_30'></a>
<a id='line_31'>1:10 The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted:</a>
<a id='line_32'>the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.</a>
<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'>1:11 Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for the</a>
<a id='line_35'>wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field is</a>
<a id='line_36'>perished.</a>
<a id='line_37'></a>
<a id='line_38'>1:12 The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the</a>
<a id='line_39'>pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the</a>
<a id='line_40'>trees of the field, are withered: because joy is withered away from</a>
<a id='line_41'>the sons of men.</a>
<a id='line_42'></a>
<a id='line_43'>1:13 Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of</a>
<a id='line_44'>the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of my God:</a>
<a id='line_45'>for the meat offering and the drink offering is withholden from the</a>
<a id='line_46'>house of your God.</a>
<a id='line_47'></a>
<a id='line_48'>1:14 Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders and</a>
<a id='line_49'>all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD your God,</a>
<a id='line_50'>and cry unto the LORD, 1:15 Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD</a>
<a id='line_51'>is at hand, and as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>1:16 Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness</a>
<a id='line_54'>from the house of our God?  1:17 The seed is rotten under their clods,</a>
<a id='line_55'>the garners are laid desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn</a>
<a id='line_56'>is withered.</a>
<a id='line_57'></a>
<a id='line_58'>1:18 How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed,</a>
<a id='line_59'>because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are made</a>
<a id='line_60'>desolate.</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>1:19 O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the</a>
<a id='line_63'>pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of</a>
<a id='line_64'>the field.</a>
<a id='line_65'></a>
<a id='line_66'>1:20 The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of</a>
<a id='line_67'>waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the</a>
<a id='line_68'>wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_69'></a>
<a id='line_70'>2:1 Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy</a>
<a id='line_71'>mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of</a>
<a id='line_72'>the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand; 2:2 A day of darkness and of</a>
<a id='line_73'>gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning</a>
<a id='line_74'>spread upon the mountains: a great people and a strong; there hath not</a>
<a id='line_75'>been ever the like, neither shall be any more after it, even to the</a>
<a id='line_76'>years of many generations.</a>
<a id='line_77'></a>
<a id='line_78'>2:3 A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth: the</a>
<a id='line_79'>land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate</a>
<a id='line_80'>wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.</a>
<a id='line_81'></a>
<a id='line_82'>2:4 The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as</a>
<a id='line_83'>horsemen, so shall they run.</a>
<a id='line_84'></a>
<a id='line_85'>2:5 Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they</a>
<a id='line_86'>leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the stubble, as</a>
<a id='line_87'>a strong people set in battle array.</a>
<a id='line_88'></a>
<a id='line_89'>2:6 Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces shall</a>
<a id='line_90'>gather blackness.</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>2:7 They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like men</a>
<a id='line_93'>of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and they shall not</a>
<a id='line_94'>break their ranks: 2:8 Neither shall one thrust another; they shall</a>
<a id='line_95'>walk every one in his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they</a>
<a id='line_96'>shall not be wounded.</a>
<a id='line_97'></a>
<a id='line_98'>2:9 They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the</a>
<a id='line_99'>wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in at the</a>
<a id='line_100'>windows like a thief.</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>2:10 The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the</a>
<a id='line_103'>sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their</a>
<a id='line_104'>shining: 2:11 And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for</a>
<a id='line_105'>his camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word: for</a>
<a id='line_106'>the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who can abide it?</a>
<a id='line_107'>2:12 Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with all</a>
<a id='line_108'>your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:</a>
<a id='line_109'>2:13 And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the</a>
<a id='line_110'>LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of</a>
<a id='line_111'>great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.</a>
<a id='line_112'></a>
<a id='line_113'>2:14 Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing</a>
<a id='line_114'>behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the LORD</a>
<a id='line_115'>your God?  2:15 Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a</a>
<a id='line_116'>solemn assembly: 2:16 Gather the people, sanctify the congregation,</a>
<a id='line_117'>assemble the elders, gather the children, and those that suck the</a>
<a id='line_118'>breasts: let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out</a>
<a id='line_119'>of her closet.</a>
<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>2:17 Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the</a>
<a id='line_122'>porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_123'>give not thine heritage to reproach, that the heathen should rule over</a>
<a id='line_124'>them: wherefore should they say among the people, Where is their God?</a>
<a id='line_125'>2:18 Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his people.</a>
<a id='line_126'></a>
<a id='line_127'>2:19 Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I will</a>
<a id='line_128'>send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be satisfied therewith:</a>
<a id='line_129'>and I will no more make you a reproach among the heathen: 2:20 But I</a>
<a id='line_130'>will remove far off from you the northern army, and will drive him</a>
<a id='line_131'>into a land barren and desolate, with his face toward the east sea,</a>
<a id='line_132'>and his hinder part toward the utmost sea, and his stink shall come</a>
<a id='line_133'>up, and his ill savour shall come up, because he hath done great</a>
<a id='line_134'>things.</a>
<a id='line_135'></a>
<a id='line_136'>2:21 Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do great</a>
<a id='line_137'>things.</a>
<a id='line_138'></a>
<a id='line_139'>2:22 Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the</a>
<a id='line_140'>wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig tree and</a>
<a id='line_141'>the vine do yield their strength.</a>
<a id='line_142'></a>
<a id='line_143'>2:23 Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your</a>
<a id='line_144'>God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately, and he will</a>
<a id='line_145'>cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter</a>
<a id='line_146'>rain in the first month.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>2:24 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall</a>
<a id='line_149'>overflow with wine and oil.</a>
<a id='line_150'></a>
<a id='line_151'>2:25 And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten,</a>
<a id='line_152'>the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the palmerworm, my great army</a>
<a id='line_153'>which I sent among you.</a>
<a id='line_154'></a>
<a id='line_155'>2:26 And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name</a>
<a id='line_156'>of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my</a>
<a id='line_157'>people shall never be ashamed.</a>
<a id='line_158'></a>
<a id='line_159'>2:27 And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I am</a>
<a id='line_160'>the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never be</a>
<a id='line_161'>ashamed.</a>
<a id='line_162'></a>
<a id='line_163'>2:28 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my</a>
<a id='line_164'>spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall</a>
<a id='line_165'>prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see</a>
<a id='line_166'>visions: 2:29 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in</a>
<a id='line_167'>those days will I pour out my spirit.</a>
<a id='line_168'></a>
<a id='line_169'>2:30 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth, blood,</a>
<a id='line_170'>and fire, and pillars of smoke.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>2:31 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood,</a>
<a id='line_173'>before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>2:32 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the name</a>
<a id='line_176'>of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem</a>
<a id='line_177'>shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in the remnant whom</a>
<a id='line_178'>the LORD shall call.</a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>3:1 For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall bring</a>
<a id='line_181'>again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem, 3:2 I will also gather all</a>
<a id='line_182'>nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoshaphat, and</a>
<a id='line_183'>will plead with them there for my people and for my heritage Israel,</a>
<a id='line_184'>whom they have scattered among the nations, and parted my land.</a>
<a id='line_185'></a>
<a id='line_186'>3:3 And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy for an</a>
<a id='line_187'>harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might drink.</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>3:4 Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and all</a>
<a id='line_190'>the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence? and if ye</a>
<a id='line_191'>recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return your recompence upon</a>
<a id='line_192'>your own head; 3:5 Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and</a>
<a id='line_193'>have carried into your temples my goodly pleasant things: 3:6 The</a>
<a id='line_194'>children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have ye sold unto</a>
<a id='line_195'>the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border.</a>
<a id='line_196'></a>
<a id='line_197'>3:7 Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have sold</a>
<a id='line_198'>them, and will return your recompence upon your own head: 3:8 And I</a>
<a id='line_199'>will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the children</a>
<a id='line_200'>of Judah, and they shall sell them to the Sabeans, to a people far</a>
<a id='line_201'>off: for the LORD hath spoken it.</a>
<a id='line_202'></a>
<a id='line_203'>3:9 Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the</a>
<a id='line_204'>mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up: 3:10</a>
<a id='line_205'>Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into spears:</a>
<a id='line_206'>let the weak say, I am strong.</a>
<a id='line_207'></a>
<a id='line_208'>3:11 Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather</a>
<a id='line_209'>yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones to come</a>
<a id='line_210'>down, O LORD.</a>
<a id='line_211'></a>
<a id='line_212'>3:12 Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of</a>
<a id='line_213'>Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen round</a>
<a id='line_214'>about.</a>
<a id='line_215'></a>
<a id='line_216'>3:13 Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you</a>
<a id='line_217'>down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness</a>
<a id='line_218'>is great.</a>
<a id='line_219'></a>
<a id='line_220'>3:14 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day of</a>
<a id='line_221'>the LORD is near in the valley of decision.</a>
<a id='line_222'></a>
<a id='line_223'>3:15 The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall</a>
<a id='line_224'>withdraw their shining.</a>
<a id='line_225'></a>
<a id='line_226'>3:16 The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from</a>
<a id='line_227'>Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the LORD</a>
<a id='line_228'>will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the children of</a>
<a id='line_229'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>3:17 So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion, my</a>
<a id='line_232'>holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there shall no</a>
<a id='line_233'>strangers pass through her any more.</a>
<a id='line_234'></a>
<a id='line_235'>3:18 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall</a>
<a id='line_236'>drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk, and all the</a>
<a id='line_237'>rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a fountain shall come</a>
<a id='line_238'>forth out of the house of the LORD, and shall water the valley of</a>
<a id='line_239'>Shittim.</a>
<a id='line_240'></a>
<a id='line_241'>3:19 Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate</a>
<a id='line_242'>wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah, because</a>
<a id='line_243'>they have shed innocent blood in their land.</a>
<a id='line_244'></a>
<a id='line_245'>3:20 But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to</a>
<a id='line_246'>generation.</a>
<a id='line_247'></a>
<a id='line_248'>3:21 For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for the</a>
<a id='line_249'>LORD dwelleth in Zion.</a>
