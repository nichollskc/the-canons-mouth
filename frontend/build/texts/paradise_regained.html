<a id='line_12'>  THE FIRST BOOK</a>
<a id='line_13'></a>
<a id='line_14'>  I, WHO erewhile the happy Garden sung</a>
<a id='line_15'>  By one man's disobedience lost, now sing</a>
<a id='line_16'>  Recovered Paradise to all mankind,</a>
<a id='line_17'>  By one man's firm obedience fully tried</a>
<a id='line_18'>  Through all temptation, and the Tempter foiled</a>
<a id='line_19'>  In all his wiles, defeated and repulsed,</a>
<a id='line_20'>  And Eden raised in the waste Wilderness.</a>
<a id='line_21'>    Thou Spirit, who led'st this glorious Eremite</a>
<a id='line_22'>  Into the desert, his victorious field</a>
<a id='line_23'>  Against the spiritual foe, and brought'st him thence        10</a>
<a id='line_24'>  By proof the undoubted Son of God, inspire,</a>
<a id='line_25'>  As thou art wont, my prompted song, else mute,</a>
<a id='line_26'>  And bear through highth or depth of Nature's bounds,</a>
<a id='line_27'>  With prosperous wing full summed, to tell of deeds</a>
<a id='line_28'>  Above heroic, though in secret done,</a>
<a id='line_29'>  And unrecorded left through many an age:</a>
<a id='line_30'>  Worthy to have not remained so long unsung.</a>
<a id='line_31'>    Now had the great Proclaimer, with a voice</a>
<a id='line_32'>  More awful than the sound of trumpet, cried</a>
<a id='line_33'>  Repentance, and Heaven's kingdom nigh at hand               20</a>
<a id='line_34'>  To all baptized.  To his great baptism flocked</a>
<a id='line_35'>  With awe the regions round, and with them came</a>
<a id='line_36'>  From Nazareth the son of Joseph deemed</a>
<a id='line_37'>  To the flood Jordan--came as then obscure,</a>
<a id='line_38'>  Unmarked, unknown.  But him the Baptist soon</a>
<a id='line_39'>  Descried, divinely warned, and witness bore</a>
<a id='line_40'>  As to his worthier, and would have resigned</a>
<a id='line_41'>  To him his heavenly office.  Nor was long</a>
<a id='line_42'>  His witness unconfirmed: on him baptized</a>
<a id='line_43'>  Heaven opened, and in likeness of a Dove                    30</a>
<a id='line_44'>  The Spirit descended, while the Father's voice</a>
<a id='line_45'>  From Heaven pronounced him his beloved Son.</a>
<a id='line_46'>  That heard the Adversary, who, roving still</a>
<a id='line_47'>  About the world, at that assembly famed</a>
<a id='line_48'>  Would not be last, and, with the voice divine</a>
<a id='line_49'>  Nigh thunder-struck, the exalted man to whom</a>
<a id='line_50'>  Such high attest was given a while surveyed</a>
<a id='line_51'>  With wonder; then, with envy fraught and rage,</a>
<a id='line_52'>  Flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air</a>
<a id='line_53'>  To council summons all his mighty Peers,                    40</a>
<a id='line_54'>  Within thick clouds and dark tenfold involved,</a>
<a id='line_55'>  A gloomy consistory; and them amidst,</a>
<a id='line_56'>  With looks aghast and sad, he thus bespake:--</a>
<a id='line_57'>    "O ancient Powers of Air and this wide World</a>
<a id='line_58'>  (For much more willingly I mention Air,</a>
<a id='line_59'>  This our old conquest, than remember Hell,</a>
<a id='line_60'>  Our hated habitation), well ye know</a>
<a id='line_61'>  How many ages, as the years of men,</a>
<a id='line_62'>  This Universe we have possessed, and ruled</a>
<a id='line_63'>  In manner at our will the affairs of Earth,                 50</a>
<a id='line_64'>  Since Adam and his facile consort Eve</a>
<a id='line_65'>  Lost Paradise, deceived by me, though since</a>
<a id='line_66'>  With dread attending when that fatal wound</a>
<a id='line_67'>  Shall be inflicted by the seed of Eve</a>
<a id='line_68'>  Upon my head.  Long the decrees of Heaven</a>
<a id='line_69'>  Delay, for longest time to Him is short;</a>
<a id='line_70'>  And now, too soon for us, the circling hours</a>
<a id='line_71'>  This dreaded time have compassed, wherein we</a>
<a id='line_72'>  Must bide the stroke of that long-threatened wound</a>
<a id='line_73'>  (At least, if so we can, and by the head                    60</a>
<a id='line_74'>  Broken be not intended all our power</a>
<a id='line_75'>  To be infringed, our freedom and our being</a>
<a id='line_76'>  In this fair empire won of Earth and Air)--</a>
<a id='line_77'>  For this ill news I bring: The Woman's Seed,</a>
<a id='line_78'>  Destined to this, is late of woman born.</a>
<a id='line_79'>  His birth to our just fear gave no small cause;</a>
<a id='line_80'>  But his growth now to youth's full flower, displaying</a>
<a id='line_81'>  All virtue, grace and wisdom to achieve</a>
<a id='line_82'>  Things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear.</a>
<a id='line_83'>  Before him a great Prophet, to proclaim                     70</a>
<a id='line_84'>  His coming, is sent harbinger, who all</a>
<a id='line_85'>  Invites, and in the consecrated stream</a>
<a id='line_86'>  Pretends to wash off sin, and fit them so</a>
<a id='line_87'>  Purified to receive him pure, or rather</a>
<a id='line_88'>  To do him honour as their King.  All come,</a>
<a id='line_89'>  And he himself among them was baptized--</a>
<a id='line_90'>  Not thence to be more pure, but to receive</a>
<a id='line_91'>  The testimony of Heaven, that who he is</a>
<a id='line_92'>  Thenceforth the nations may not doubt.  I saw</a>
<a id='line_93'>  The Prophet do him reverence; on him, rising                80</a>
<a id='line_94'>  Out of the water, Heaven above the clouds</a>
<a id='line_95'>  Unfold her crystal doors; thence on his head</a>
<a id='line_96'>  A perfet Dove descend (whate'er it meant);</a>
<a id='line_97'>  And out of Heaven the sovraign voice I heard,</a>
<a id='line_98'>  'This is my Son beloved,--in him am pleased.'</a>
<a id='line_99'>  His mother, than, is mortal, but his Sire</a>
<a id='line_100'>  He who obtains the monarchy of Heaven;</a>
<a id='line_101'>  And what will He not do to advance his Son?</a>
<a id='line_102'>  His first-begot we know, and sore have felt,</a>
<a id='line_103'>  When his fierce thunder drove us to the Deep;               90</a>
<a id='line_104'>  Who this is we must learn, for Man he seems</a>
<a id='line_105'>  In all his lineaments, though in his face</a>
<a id='line_106'>  The glimpses of his Father's glory shine.</a>
<a id='line_107'>  Ye see our danger on the utmost edge</a>
<a id='line_108'>  Of hazard, which admits no long debate,</a>
<a id='line_109'>  But must with something sudden be opposed</a>
<a id='line_110'>  (Not force, but well-couched fraud, well-woven snares),</a>
<a id='line_111'>  Ere in the head of nations he appear,</a>
<a id='line_112'>  Their king, their leader, and supreme on Earth.</a>
<a id='line_113'>  I, when no other durst, sole undertook                      100</a>
<a id='line_114'>  The dismal expedition to find out</a>
<a id='line_115'>  And ruin Adam, and the exploit performed</a>
<a id='line_116'>  Successfully: a calmer voyage now</a>
<a id='line_117'>  Will waft me; and the way found prosperous once</a>
<a id='line_118'>  Induces best to hope of like success."</a>
<a id='line_119'>    He ended, and his words impression left</a>
<a id='line_120'>  Of much amazement to the infernal crew,</a>
<a id='line_121'>  Distracted and surprised with deep dismay</a>
<a id='line_122'>  At these sad tidings.  But no time was then</a>
<a id='line_123'>  For long indulgence to their fears or grief:                110</a>
<a id='line_124'>  Unanimous they all commit the care</a>
<a id='line_125'>  And management of this man enterprise</a>
<a id='line_126'>  To him, their great Dictator, whose attempt</a>
<a id='line_127'>  At first against mankind so well had thrived</a>
<a id='line_128'>  In Adam's overthrow, and led their march</a>
<a id='line_129'>  From Hell's deep-vaulted den to dwell in light,</a>
<a id='line_130'>  Regents, and potentates, and kings, yea gods,</a>
<a id='line_131'>  Of many a pleasant realm and province wide.</a>
<a id='line_132'>  So to the coast of Jordan he directs</a>
<a id='line_133'>  His easy steps, girded with snaky wiles,                    120</a>
<a id='line_134'>  Where he might likeliest find this new-declared,</a>
<a id='line_135'>  This man of men, attested Son of God,</a>
<a id='line_136'>  Temptation and all guile on him to try--</a>
<a id='line_137'>  So to subvert whom he suspected raised</a>
<a id='line_138'>  To end his reign on Earth so long enjoyed:</a>
<a id='line_139'>  But, contrary, unweeting he fulfilled</a>
<a id='line_140'>  The purposed counsel, pre-ordained and fixed,</a>
<a id='line_141'>  Of the Most High, who, in full frequence bright</a>
<a id='line_142'>  Of Angels, thus to Gabriel smiling spake:--</a>
<a id='line_143'>    "Gabriel, this day, by proof, thou shalt behold,          130</a>
<a id='line_144'>  Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth</a>
<a id='line_145'>  With Man or men's affairs, how I begin</a>
<a id='line_146'>  To verify that solemn message late,</a>
<a id='line_147'>  On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure</a>
<a id='line_148'>  In Galilee, that she should bear a son,</a>
<a id='line_149'>  Great in renown, and called the Son of God.</a>
<a id='line_150'>  Then told'st her, doubting how these things could be</a>
<a id='line_151'>  To her a virgin, that on her should come</a>
<a id='line_152'>  The Holy Ghost, and the power of the Highest</a>
<a id='line_153'>  O'ershadow her.  This Man, born and now upgrown,            140</a>
<a id='line_154'>  To shew him worthy of his birth divine</a>
<a id='line_155'>  And high prediction, henceforth I expose</a>
<a id='line_156'>  To Satan; let him tempt, and now assay</a>
<a id='line_157'>  His utmost subtlety, because he boasts</a>
<a id='line_158'>  And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng</a>
<a id='line_159'>  Of his Apostasy.  He might have learnt</a>
<a id='line_160'>  Less overweening, since he failed in Job,</a>
<a id='line_161'>  Whose constant perseverance overcame</a>
<a id='line_162'>  Whate'er his cruel malice could invent.</a>
<a id='line_163'>  He now shall know I can produce a man,                      150</a>
<a id='line_164'>  Of female seed, far abler to resist</a>
<a id='line_165'>  All his solicitations, and at length</a>
<a id='line_166'>  All his vast force, and drive him back to Hell--</a>
<a id='line_167'>  Winning by conquest what the first man lost</a>
<a id='line_168'>  By fallacy surprised.  But first I mean</a>
<a id='line_169'>  To exercise him in the Wilderness;</a>
<a id='line_170'>  There he shall first lay down the rudiments</a>
<a id='line_171'>  Of his great warfare, ere I send him forth</a>
<a id='line_172'>  To conquer Sin and Death, the two grand foes.</a>
<a id='line_173'>  By humiliation and strong sufferance                        160</a>
<a id='line_174'>  His weakness shall o'ercome Satanic strength,</a>
<a id='line_175'>  And all the world, and mass of sinful flesh;</a>
<a id='line_176'>  That all the Angels and aethereal Powers--</a>
<a id='line_177'>  They now, and men hereafter--may discern</a>
<a id='line_178'>  From what consummate virtue I have chose</a>
<a id='line_179'>  This perfet man, by merit called my Son,</a>
<a id='line_180'>  To earn salvation for the sons of men."</a>
<a id='line_181'>    So spake the Eternal Father, and all Heaven</a>
<a id='line_182'>  Admiring stood a space; then into hymns</a>
<a id='line_183'>  Burst forth, and in celestial measures moved,               170</a>
<a id='line_184'>  Circling the throne and singing, while the hand</a>
<a id='line_185'>  Sung with the voice, and this the argument:--</a>
<a id='line_186'>    "Victory and triumph to the Son of God,</a>
<a id='line_187'>  Now entering his great duel, not of arms,</a>
<a id='line_188'>  But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles!</a>
<a id='line_189'>  The Father knows the Son; therefore secure</a>
<a id='line_190'>  Ventures his filial virtue, though untried,</a>
<a id='line_191'>  Against whate'er may tempt, whate'er seduce,</a>
<a id='line_192'>  Allure, or terrify, or undermine.</a>
<a id='line_193'>  Be frustrate, all ye stratagems of Hell,                    180</a>
<a id='line_194'>  And, devilish machinations, come to nought!"</a>
<a id='line_195'>    So they in Heaven their odes and vigils tuned.</a>
<a id='line_196'>  Meanwhile the Son of God, who yet some days</a>
<a id='line_197'>  Lodged in Bethabara, where John baptized,</a>
<a id='line_198'>  Musing and much revolving in his breast</a>
<a id='line_199'>  How best the mighty work he might begin</a>
<a id='line_200'>  Of Saviour to mankind, and which way first</a>
<a id='line_201'>  Publish his godlike office now mature,</a>
<a id='line_202'>  One day forth walked alone, the Spirit leading</a>
<a id='line_203'>  And his deep thoughts, the better to converse               190</a>
<a id='line_204'>  With solitude, till, far from track of men,</a>
<a id='line_205'>  Thought following thought, and step by step led on,</a>
<a id='line_206'>  He entered now the bordering Desert wild,</a>
<a id='line_207'>  And, with dark shades and rocks environed round,</a>
<a id='line_208'>  His holy meditations thus pursued:--</a>
<a id='line_209'>    "O what a multitude of thoughts at once</a>
<a id='line_210'>  Awakened in me swarm, while I consider</a>
<a id='line_211'>  What from within I feel myself, and hear</a>
<a id='line_212'>  What from without comes often to my ears,</a>
<a id='line_213'>  Ill sorting with my present state compared!                 200</a>
<a id='line_214'>  When I was yet a child, no childish play</a>
<a id='line_215'>  To me was pleasing; all my mind was set</a>
<a id='line_216'>  Serious to learn and know, and thence to do,</a>
<a id='line_217'>  What might be public good; myself I thought</a>
<a id='line_218'>  Born to that end, born to promote all truth,</a>
<a id='line_219'>  All righteous things.  Therefore, above my years,</a>
<a id='line_220'>  The Law of God I read, and found it sweet;</a>
<a id='line_221'>  Made it my whole delight, and in it grew</a>
<a id='line_222'>  To such perfection that, ere yet my age</a>
<a id='line_223'>  Had measured twice six years, at our great Feast            210</a>
<a id='line_224'>  I went into the Temple, there to hear</a>
<a id='line_225'>  The teachers of our Law, and to propose</a>
<a id='line_226'>  What might improve my knowledge or their own,</a>
<a id='line_227'>  And was admired by all.  Yet this not all</a>
<a id='line_228'>  To which my spirit aspired.  Victorious deeds</a>
<a id='line_229'>  Flamed in my heart, heroic acts--one while</a>
<a id='line_230'>  To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke;</a>
<a id='line_231'>  Then to subdue and quell, o'er all the earth,</a>
<a id='line_232'>  Brute violence and proud tyrannic power,</a>
<a id='line_233'>  Till truth were freed, and equity restored:                 220</a>
<a id='line_234'>  Yet held it more humane, more heavenly, first</a>
<a id='line_235'>  By winning words to conquer willing hearts,</a>
<a id='line_236'>  And make persuasion do the work of fear;</a>
<a id='line_237'>  At least to try, and teach the erring soul,</a>
<a id='line_238'>  Not wilfully misdoing, but unware</a>
<a id='line_239'>  Misled; the stubborn only to subdue.</a>
<a id='line_240'>  These growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving,</a>
<a id='line_241'>  By words at times cast forth, inly rejoiced,</a>
<a id='line_242'>  And said to me apart, 'High are thy thoughts,</a>
<a id='line_243'>  O Son! but nourish them, and let them soar                  230</a>
<a id='line_244'>  To what highth sacred virtue and true worth</a>
<a id='line_245'>  Can raise them, though above example high;</a>
<a id='line_246'>  By matchless deeds express thy matchless Sire.</a>
<a id='line_247'>  For know, thou art no son of mortal man;</a>
<a id='line_248'>  Though men esteem thee low of parentage,</a>
<a id='line_249'>  Thy Father is the Eternal King who rules</a>
<a id='line_250'>  All Heaven and Earth, Angels and sons of men.</a>
<a id='line_251'>  A messenger from God foretold thy birth</a>
<a id='line_252'>  Conceived in me a virgin; he foretold</a>
<a id='line_253'>  Thou shouldst be great, and sit on David's throne,          240</a>
<a id='line_254'>  And of thy kingdom there should be no end.</a>
<a id='line_255'>  At thy nativity a glorious quire</a>
<a id='line_256'>  Of Angels, in the fields of Bethlehem, sung</a>
<a id='line_257'>  To shepherds, watching at their folds by night,</a>
<a id='line_258'>  And told them the Messiah now was born,</a>
<a id='line_259'>  Where they might see him; and to thee they came,</a>
<a id='line_260'>  Directed to the manger where thou lay'st;</a>
<a id='line_261'>  For in the inn was left no better room.</a>
<a id='line_262'>  A Star, not seen before, in heaven appearing,</a>
<a id='line_263'>  Guided the Wise Men thither from the East,                  250</a>
<a id='line_264'>  To honour thee with incense, myrrh, and gold;</a>
<a id='line_265'>  By whose bright course led on they found the place,</a>
<a id='line_266'>  Affirming it thy star, new-graven in heaven,</a>
<a id='line_267'>  By which they knew thee King of Israel born.</a>
<a id='line_268'>  Just Simeon and prophetic Anna, warned</a>
<a id='line_269'>  By vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake,</a>
<a id='line_270'>  Before the altar and the vested priest,</a>
<a id='line_271'>  Like things of thee to all that present stood.'</a>
<a id='line_272'>  This having heart, straight I again revolved</a>
<a id='line_273'>  The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ               260</a>
<a id='line_274'>  Concerning the Messiah, to our scribes</a>
<a id='line_275'>  Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake</a>
<a id='line_276'>  I am--this chiefly, that my way must lie</a>
<a id='line_277'>  Through many a hard assay, even to the death,</a>
<a id='line_278'>  Ere I the promised kingdom can attain,</a>
<a id='line_279'>  Or work redemption for mankind, whose sins'</a>
<a id='line_280'>  Full weight must be transferred upon my head.</a>
<a id='line_281'>  Yet, neither thus disheartened or dismayed,</a>
<a id='line_282'>  The time prefixed I waited; when behold</a>
<a id='line_283'>  The Baptist (of whose birth I oft had heard,                270</a>
<a id='line_284'>  Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come</a>
<a id='line_285'>  Before Messiah, and his way prepare!</a>
<a id='line_286'>  I, as all others, to his baptism came,</a>
<a id='line_287'>  Which I believed was from above; but he</a>
<a id='line_288'>  Straight knew me, and with loudest voice proclaimed</a>
<a id='line_289'>  Me him (for it was shewn him so from Heaven)--</a>
<a id='line_290'>  Me him whose harbinger he was; and first</a>
<a id='line_291'>  Refused on me his baptism to confer,</a>
<a id='line_292'>  As much his greater, and was hardly won.</a>
<a id='line_293'>  But, as I rose out of the laving stream,                    280</a>
<a id='line_294'>  Heaven opened her eternal doors, from whence</a>
<a id='line_295'>  The Spirit descended on me like a Dove;</a>
<a id='line_296'>  And last, the sum of all, my Father's voice,</a>
<a id='line_297'>  Audibly heard from Heaven, pronounced me his,</a>
<a id='line_298'>  Me his beloved Son, in whom alone</a>
<a id='line_299'>  He was well pleased: by which I knew the time</a>
<a id='line_300'>  Now full, that I no more should live obscure,</a>
<a id='line_301'>  But openly begin, as best becomes</a>
<a id='line_302'>  The authority which I derived from Heaven.</a>
<a id='line_303'>  And now by some strong motion I am led                      290</a>
<a id='line_304'>  Into this wilderness; to what intent</a>
<a id='line_305'>  I learn not yet.  Perhaps I need not know;</a>
<a id='line_306'>  For what concerns my knowledge God reveals."</a>
<a id='line_307'>    So spake our Morning Star, then in his rise,</a>
<a id='line_308'>  And, looking round, on every side beheld</a>
<a id='line_309'>  A pathless desert, dusk with horrid shades.</a>
<a id='line_310'>  The way he came, not having marked return,</a>
<a id='line_311'>  Was difficult, by human steps untrod;</a>
<a id='line_312'>  And he still on was led, but with such thoughts</a>
<a id='line_313'>  Accompanied of things past and to come                      300</a>
<a id='line_314'>  Lodged in his breast as well might recommend</a>
<a id='line_315'>  Such solitude before choicest society.</a>
<a id='line_316'>    Full forty days he passed--whether on hill</a>
<a id='line_317'>  Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night</a>
<a id='line_318'>  Under the covert of some ancient oak</a>
<a id='line_319'>  Or cedar to defend him from the dew,</a>
<a id='line_320'>  Or harboured in one cave, is not revealed;</a>
<a id='line_321'>  Nor tasted human food, nor hunger felt,</a>
<a id='line_322'>  Till those days ended; hungered then at last</a>
<a id='line_323'>  Among wild beasts.  They at his sight grew mild,            310</a>
<a id='line_324'>  Nor sleeping him nor waking harmed; his walk</a>
<a id='line_325'>  The fiery serpent fled and noxious worm;</a>
<a id='line_326'>  The lion and fierce tiger glared aloof.</a>
<a id='line_327'>  But now an aged man in rural weeds,</a>
<a id='line_328'>  Following, as seemed, the quest of some stray eye,</a>
<a id='line_329'>  Or withered sticks to gather, which might serve</a>
<a id='line_330'>  Against a winter's day, when winds blow keen,</a>
<a id='line_331'>  To warm him wet returned from field at eve,</a>
<a id='line_332'>  He saw approach; who first with curious eye</a>
<a id='line_333'>  Perused him, then with words thus uttered spake:--          320</a>
<a id='line_334'>    "Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place,</a>
<a id='line_335'>  So far from path or road of men, who pass</a>
<a id='line_336'>  In troop or caravan? for single none</a>
<a id='line_337'>  Durst ever, who returned, and dropt not here</a>
<a id='line_338'>  His carcass, pined with hunger and with droughth.</a>
<a id='line_339'>  I ask the rather, and the more admire,</a>
<a id='line_340'>  For that to me thou seem'st the man whom late</a>
<a id='line_341'>  Our new baptizing Prophet at the ford</a>
<a id='line_342'>  Of Jordan honoured so, and called thee Son</a>
<a id='line_343'>  Of God.  I saw and heard, for we sometimes                  330</a>
<a id='line_344'>  Who dwell this wild, constrained by want, come forth</a>
<a id='line_345'>  To town or village nigh (nighest is far),</a>
<a id='line_346'>  Where aught we hear, and curious are to hear,</a>
<a id='line_347'>  What happens new; fame also finds us out."</a>
<a id='line_348'>    To whom the Son of God:--"Who brought me hither</a>
<a id='line_349'>  Will bring me hence; no other guide I seek."</a>
<a id='line_350'>    "By miracle he may," replied the swain;</a>
<a id='line_351'>  "What other way I see not; for we here</a>
<a id='line_352'>  Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inured</a>
<a id='line_353'>  More than the camel, and to drink go far--                  340</a>
<a id='line_354'>  Men to much misery and hardship born.</a>
<a id='line_355'>  But, if thou be the Son of God, command</a>
<a id='line_356'>  That out of these hard stones be made thee bread;</a>
<a id='line_357'>  So shalt thou save thyself, and us relieve</a>
<a id='line_358'>  With food, whereof we wretched seldom taste."</a>
<a id='line_359'>    He ended, and the Son of God replied:--</a>
<a id='line_360'>  "Think'st thou such force in bread?  Is it not written</a>
<a id='line_361'>  (For I discern thee other than thou seem'st),</a>
<a id='line_362'>  Man lives not by bread only, but each word</a>
<a id='line_363'>  Proceeding from the mouth of God, who fed                   350</a>
<a id='line_364'>  Our fathers here with manna?  In the Mount</a>
<a id='line_365'>  Moses was forty days, nor eat nor drank;</a>
<a id='line_366'>  And forty days Eliah without food</a>
<a id='line_367'>  Wandered this barren waste; the same I now.</a>
<a id='line_368'>  Why dost thou, then, suggest to me distrust</a>
<a id='line_369'>  Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art?"</a>
<a id='line_370'>    Whom thus answered the Arch-Fiend, now undisguised:--</a>
<a id='line_371'>  "'Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate</a>
<a id='line_372'>  Who, leagued with millions more in rash revolt,</a>
<a id='line_373'>  Kept not my happy station, but was driven                   360</a>
<a id='line_374'>  With them from bliss to the bottomless Deep--</a>
<a id='line_375'>  Yet to that hideous place not so confined</a>
<a id='line_376'>  By rigour unconniving but that oft,</a>
<a id='line_377'>  Leaving my dolorous prison, I enjoy</a>
<a id='line_378'>  Large liberty to round this globe of Earth,</a>
<a id='line_379'>  Or range in the Air; nor from the Heaven of Heavens</a>
<a id='line_380'>  Hath he excluded my resort sometimes.</a>
<a id='line_381'>  I came, among the Sons of God, when he</a>
<a id='line_382'>  Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job,</a>
<a id='line_383'>  To prove him, and illustrate his high worth;                370</a>
<a id='line_384'>  And, when to all his Angels he proposed</a>
<a id='line_385'>  To draw the proud king Ahab into fraud,</a>
<a id='line_386'>  That he might fall in Ramoth, they demurring,</a>
<a id='line_387'>  I undertook that office, and the tongues</a>
<a id='line_388'>  Of all his flattering prophets glibbed with lies</a>
<a id='line_389'>  To his destruction, as I had in charge:</a>
<a id='line_390'>  For what he bids I do.  Though I have lost</a>
<a id='line_391'>  Much lustre of my native brightness, lost</a>
<a id='line_392'>  To be beloved of God, I have not lost</a>
<a id='line_393'>  To love, at least contemplate and admire,                   380</a>
<a id='line_394'>  What I see excellent in good, or fair,</a>
<a id='line_395'>  Or virtuous; I should so have lost all sense.</a>
<a id='line_396'>  What can be then less in me than desire</a>
<a id='line_397'>  To see thee and approach thee, whom I know</a>
<a id='line_398'>  Declared the Son of God, to hear attent</a>
<a id='line_399'>  Thy wisdom, and behold thy godlike deeds?</a>
<a id='line_400'>  Men generally think me much a foe</a>
<a id='line_401'>  To all mankind.  Why should I? they to me</a>
<a id='line_402'>  Never did wrong or violence.  By them</a>
<a id='line_403'>  I lost not what I lost; rather by them                      390</a>
<a id='line_404'>  I gained what I have gained, and with them dwell</a>
<a id='line_405'>  Copartner in these regions of the World,</a>
<a id='line_406'>  If not disposer--lend them oft my aid,</a>
<a id='line_407'>  Oft my advice by presages and signs,</a>
<a id='line_408'>  And answers, oracles, portents, and dreams,</a>
<a id='line_409'>  Whereby they may direct their future life.</a>
<a id='line_410'>  Envy, they say, excites me, thus to gain</a>
<a id='line_411'>  Companions of my misery and woe!</a>
<a id='line_412'>  At first it may be; but, long since with woe</a>
<a id='line_413'>  Nearer acquainted, now I feel by proof                      400</a>
<a id='line_414'>  That fellowship in pain divides not smart,</a>
<a id='line_415'>  Nor lightens aught each man's peculiar load;</a>
<a id='line_416'>  Small consolation, then, were Man adjoined.</a>
<a id='line_417'>  This wounds me most (what can it less?) that Man,</a>
<a id='line_418'>  Man fallen, shall be restored, I never more."</a>
<a id='line_419'>    To whom our Saviour sternly thus replied:--</a>
<a id='line_420'>  "Deservedly thou griev'st, composed of lies</a>
<a id='line_421'>  From the beginning, and in lies wilt end,</a>
<a id='line_422'>  Who boast'st release from Hell, and leave to come</a>
<a id='line_423'>  Into the Heaven of Heavens.  Thou com'st, indeed,           410</a>
<a id='line_424'>  As a poor miserable captive thrall</a>
<a id='line_425'>  Comes to the place where he before had sat</a>
<a id='line_426'>  Among the prime in splendour, now deposed,</a>
<a id='line_427'>  Ejected, emptied, gazed, unpitied, shunned,</a>
<a id='line_428'>  A spectacle of ruin, or of scorn,</a>
<a id='line_429'>  To all the host of Heaven.  The happy place</a>
<a id='line_430'>  Imparts to thee no happiness, no joy--</a>
<a id='line_431'>  Rather inflames thy torment, representing</a>
<a id='line_432'>  Lost bliss, to thee no more communicable;</a>
<a id='line_433'>  So never more in Hell than when in Heaven.                  420</a>
<a id='line_434'>  But thou art serviceable to Heaven's King!</a>
<a id='line_435'>  Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear</a>
<a id='line_436'>  Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites?</a>
<a id='line_437'>  What but thy malice moved thee to misdeem</a>
<a id='line_438'>  Of righteous Job, then cruelly to afflict him</a>
<a id='line_439'>  With all inflictions? but his patience won.</a>
<a id='line_440'>  The other service was thy chosen task,</a>
<a id='line_441'>  To be a liar in four hundred mouths;</a>
<a id='line_442'>  For lying is thy sustenance, thy food.</a>
<a id='line_443'>  Yet thou pretend'st to truth! all oracles                   430</a>
<a id='line_444'>  By thee are given, and what confessed more true</a>
<a id='line_445'>  Among the nations?  That hath been thy craft,</a>
<a id='line_446'>  By mixing somewhat true to vent more lies.</a>
<a id='line_447'>  But what have been thy answers? what but dark,</a>
<a id='line_448'>  Ambiguous, and with double sense deluding,</a>
<a id='line_449'>  Which they who asked have seldom understood,</a>
<a id='line_450'>  And, not well understood, as good not known?</a>
<a id='line_451'>  Who ever, by consulting at thy shrine,</a>
<a id='line_452'>  Returned the wiser, or the more instruct</a>
<a id='line_453'>  To fly or follow what concerned him most,                   440</a>
<a id='line_454'>  And run not sooner to his fatal snare?</a>
<a id='line_455'>  For God hath justly given the nations up</a>
<a id='line_456'>  To thy delusions; justly, since they fell</a>
<a id='line_457'>  Idolatrous.  But, when his purpose is</a>
<a id='line_458'>  Among them to declare his providence,</a>
<a id='line_459'>  To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth,</a>
<a id='line_460'>  But from him, or his Angels president</a>
<a id='line_461'>  In every province, who, themselves disdaining</a>
<a id='line_462'>  To approach thy temples, give thee in command</a>
<a id='line_463'>  What, to the smallest tittle, thou shalt say                450</a>
<a id='line_464'>  To thy adorers?  Thou, with trembling fear,</a>
<a id='line_465'>  Or like a fawning parasite, obey'st;</a>
<a id='line_466'>  Then to thyself ascrib'st the truth foretold.</a>
<a id='line_467'>  But this thy glory shall be soon retrenched;</a>
<a id='line_468'>  No more shalt thou by oracling abuse</a>
<a id='line_469'>  The Gentiles; henceforth oracles are ceased,</a>
<a id='line_470'>  And thou no more with pomp and sacrifice</a>
<a id='line_471'>  Shalt be enquired at Delphos or elsewhere--</a>
<a id='line_472'>  At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute.</a>
<a id='line_473'>  God hath now sent his living Oracle                         460</a>
<a id='line_474'>  Into the world to teach his final will,</a>
<a id='line_475'>  And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell</a>
<a id='line_476'>  In pious hearts, an inward oracle</a>
<a id='line_477'>  To all truth requisite for men to know."</a>
<a id='line_478'>    So spake our Saviour; but the subtle Fiend,</a>
<a id='line_479'>  Though inly stung with anger and disdain,</a>
<a id='line_480'>  Dissembled, and this answer smooth returned:--</a>
<a id='line_481'>    "Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke,</a>
<a id='line_482'>  And urged me hard with doings which not will,</a>
<a id='line_483'>  But misery, hath wrested from me.  Where                    470</a>
<a id='line_484'>  Easily canst thou find one miserable,</a>
<a id='line_485'>  And not inforced oft-times to part from truth,</a>
<a id='line_486'>  If it may stand him more in stead to lie,</a>
<a id='line_487'>  Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure?</a>
<a id='line_488'>  But thou art placed above me; thou art Lord;</a>
<a id='line_489'>  From thee I can, and must, submiss, endure</a>
<a id='line_490'>  Cheek or reproof, and glad to scape so quit.</a>
<a id='line_491'>  Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk,</a>
<a id='line_492'>  Smooth on the tongue discoursed, pleasing to the ear,</a>
<a id='line_493'>  And tunable as sylvan pipe or song;                         480</a>
<a id='line_494'>  What wonder, then, if I delight to hear</a>
<a id='line_495'>  Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire</a>
<a id='line_496'>  Virtue who follow not her lore.  Permit me</a>
<a id='line_497'>  To hear thee when I come (since no man comes),</a>
<a id='line_498'>  And talk at least, though I despair to attain.</a>
<a id='line_499'>  Thy Father, who is holy, wise, and pure,</a>
<a id='line_500'>  Suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest</a>
<a id='line_501'>  To tread his sacred courts, and minister</a>
<a id='line_502'>  About his altar, handling holy things,</a>
<a id='line_503'>  Praying or vowing, and voutsafed his voice                  490</a>
<a id='line_504'>  To Balaam reprobate, a prophet yet</a>
<a id='line_505'>  Inspired: disdain not such access to me."</a>
<a id='line_506'>    To whom our Saviour, with unaltered brow:--</a>
<a id='line_507'>  "Thy coming hither, though I know thy scope,</a>
<a id='line_508'>  I bid not, or forbid.  Do as thou find'st</a>
<a id='line_509'>  Permission from above; thou canst not more."</a>
<a id='line_510'>    He added not; and Satan, bowling low</a>
<a id='line_511'>  His gray dissimulation, disappeared,</a>
<a id='line_512'>  Into thin air diffused: for now began</a>
<a id='line_513'>  Night with her sullen wing to double-shade                  500</a>
<a id='line_514'>  The desert; fowls in their clay nests were couched;</a>
<a id='line_515'>  And now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam.</a>

<a id='line_518'>  THE SECOND BOOK</a>

<a id='line_520'>  MEANWHILE the new-baptized, who yet remained</a>
<a id='line_521'>  At Jordan with the Baptist, and had seen</a>
<a id='line_522'>  Him whom they heard so late expressly called</a>
<a id='line_523'>  Jesus Messiah, Son of God, declared,</a>
<a id='line_524'>  And on that high authority had believed,</a>
<a id='line_525'>  And with him talked, and with him lodged--I mean</a>
<a id='line_526'>  Andrew and Simon, famous after known,</a>
<a id='line_527'>  With others, though in Holy Writ not named--</a>
<a id='line_528'>  Now missing him, their joy so lately found,</a>
<a id='line_529'>  So lately found and so abruptly gone,                       10</a>
<a id='line_530'>  Began to doubt, and doubted many days,</a>
<a id='line_531'>  And, as the days increased, increased their doubt.</a>
<a id='line_532'>  Sometimes they thought he might be only shewn,</a>
<a id='line_533'>  And for a time caught up to God, as once</a>
<a id='line_534'>  Moses was in the Mount and missing long,</a>
<a id='line_535'>  And the great Thisbite, who on fiery wheels</a>
<a id='line_536'>  Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to come.</a>
<a id='line_537'>  Therefore, as those young prophets then with care</a>
<a id='line_538'>  Sought lost Eliah, so in each place these</a>
<a id='line_539'>  Nigh to Bethabara--in Jericho                               20</a>
<a id='line_540'>  The city of palms, AEnon, and Salem old,</a>

<a id='line_542'>  On this side the broad lake Genezaret,</a>
<a id='line_543'>  Or in Peraea--but returned in vain.</a>
<a id='line_544'>  Then on the bank of Jordan, by a creek,</a>
<a id='line_545'>  Where winds with reeds and osiers whispering play,</a>
<a id='line_546'>  Plain fishermen (no greater men them call),</a>
<a id='line_547'>  Close in a cottage low together got,</a>
<a id='line_548'>  Their unexpected loss and plaints outbreathed:--</a>
<a id='line_549'>    "Alas, from what high hope to what relapse                30</a>
<a id='line_550'>  Unlooked for are we fallen!  Our eyes beheld</a>

<a id='line_554'>  'Now, now, for sure, deliverance is at hand;</a>
<a id='line_555'>  The kingdom shall to Israel be restored:'</a>
<a id='line_556'>  Thus we rejoiced, but soon our joy is turned</a>
<a id='line_557'>  Into perplexity and new amaze.</a>
<a id='line_558'>  For whither is he gone? what accident</a>
<a id='line_559'>  Hath rapt him from us? will he now retire                   40</a>
<a id='line_560'>  After appearance, and again prolong</a>
<a id='line_561'>  Our expectation?  God of Israel,</a>
<a id='line_562'>  Send thy Messiah forth; the time is come.</a>
<a id='line_563'>  Behold the kings of the earth, how they oppress</a>

<a id='line_565'>  They have exalted, and behind them cast</a>
<a id='line_566'>  All fear of Thee; arise, and vindicate</a>
<a id='line_567'>  Thy glory; free thy people from their yoke!</a>
<a id='line_568'>  But let us wait; thus far He hath performed--</a>
<a id='line_569'>  Sent his Anointed, and to us revealed him                   50</a>

<a id='line_574'>  Nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall--</a>
<a id='line_575'>  Mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence:</a>
<a id='line_576'>  Soon we shall see our hope, our joy, return."</a>
<a id='line_577'>    Thus they out of their plaints new hope resume</a>

<a id='line_583'>  Motherly cares and fears got head, and raised</a>
<a id='line_584'>  Some troubled thoughts, which she in sighs thus clad:--</a>
<a id='line_585'>    "Oh, what avails me now that honour high,</a>
<a id='line_586'>  To have conceived of God, or that salute,</a>
<a id='line_587'>  'Hail, highly favoured, among women blest!'</a>
<a id='line_588'>  While I to sorrows am no less advanced,</a>

<a id='line_593'>  From the bleak air?  A stable was our warmth,</a>
<a id='line_594'>  A manger his; yet soon enforced to fly</a>
<a id='line_595'>  Thence into Egypt, till the murderous king</a>
<a id='line_596'>  Were dead, who sought his life, and, missing, filled</a>
<a id='line_597'>  With infant blood the streets of Bethlehem.</a>

<a id='line_599'>  Hath been our dwelling many years; his life                 80</a>
<a id='line_600'>  Private, unactive, calm, contemplative,</a>
<a id='line_601'>  Little suspicious to any king.  But now,</a>
<a id='line_602'>  Full grown to man, acknowledged, as I hear,</a>
<a id='line_603'>  By John the Baptist, and in public shewn,</a>
<a id='line_604'>  Son owned from Heaven by his Father's voice,</a>
<a id='line_605'>  I looked for some great change.  To honour? no;</a>
<a id='line_606'>  But trouble, as old Simeon plain foretold,</a>
<a id='line_607'>  That to the fall and rising he should be</a>
<a id='line_608'>  Of many in Israel, and to a sign</a>
<a id='line_609'>  Spoken against--that through my very soul                   90</a>
<a id='line_610'>  A sword shall pierce.  This is my favoured lot,</a>
<a id='line_611'>  My exaltation to afflictions high!</a>
<a id='line_612'>  Afflicted I may be, it seems, and blest!</a>
<a id='line_613'>  I will not argue that, nor will repine.</a>
<a id='line_614'>  But where delays he now?  Some great intent</a>
<a id='line_615'>  Conceals him.  When twelve years he scarce had seen,</a>
<a id='line_616'>  I lost him, but so found as well I saw</a>
<a id='line_617'>  He could not lose himself, but went about</a>
<a id='line_618'>  His Father's business.  What he meant I mused--</a>
<a id='line_619'>  Since understand; much more his absence now                 100</a>
<a id='line_620'>  Thus long to some great purpose he obscures.</a>
<a id='line_621'>  But I to wait with patience am inured;</a>
<a id='line_622'>  My heart hath been a storehouse long of things</a>
<a id='line_623'>  And sayings laid up, pretending strange events."</a>
<a id='line_624'>    Thus Mary, pondering oft, and oft to mind</a>
<a id='line_625'>  Recalling what remarkably had passed</a>
<a id='line_626'>  Since first her Salutation heard, with thoughts</a>
<a id='line_627'>  Meekly composed awaited the fulfilling:</a>
<a id='line_628'>  The while her Son, tracing the desert wild,</a>
<a id='line_629'>  Sole, but with holiest meditations fed,                     110</a>
<a id='line_630'>  Into himself descended, and at once</a>
<a id='line_631'>  All his great work to come before him set--</a>
<a id='line_632'>  How to begin, how to accomplish best</a>
<a id='line_633'>  His end of being on Earth, and mission high.</a>
<a id='line_634'>  For Satan, with sly preface to return,</a>
<a id='line_635'>  Had left him vacant, and with speed was gone</a>
<a id='line_636'>  Up to the middle region of thick air,</a>
<a id='line_637'>  Where all his Potentates in council sate.</a>
<a id='line_638'>  There, without sign of boast, or sign of joy,</a>
<a id='line_639'>  Solicitous and blank, he thus began:--                      120</a>
<a id='line_640'>    "Princes, Heaven's ancient Sons, AEthereal Thrones--</a>
<a id='line_641'>  Daemonian Spirits now, from the element</a>

<a id='line_646'>  Is risen to invade us, who no less</a>
<a id='line_647'>  Threatens than our expulsion down to Hell.</a>

<a id='line_651'>  Far other labour to be undergone</a>
<a id='line_652'>  Than when I dealt with Adam, first of men,</a>
<a id='line_653'>  Though Adam by his wife's allurement fell,</a>
<a id='line_654'>  However to this Man inferior far--</a>
<a id='line_655'>  If he be Man by mother's side, at least</a>
<a id='line_656'>  With more than human gifts from Heaven adorned,</a>
<a id='line_657'>  Perfections absolute, graces divine,</a>
<a id='line_658'>  And amplitude of mind to greatest deeds.</a>
<a id='line_659'>  Therefore I am returned, lest confidence                    140</a>
<a id='line_660'>  Of my success with Eve in Paradise</a>

<a id='line_664'>  Or counsel to assist, lest I, who erst</a>
<a id='line_665'>  Thought none my equal, now be overmatched."</a>
<a id='line_666'>    So spake the old Serpent, doubting, and from all</a>
<a id='line_667'>  With clamour was assured their utmost aid</a>
<a id='line_668'>  At his command; when from amidst them rose</a>
<a id='line_669'>  Belial, the dissolutest Spirit that fell,                   150</a>
<a id='line_670'>  The sensualest, and, after Asmodai,</a>
<a id='line_671'>  The fleshliest Incubus, and thus advised:--</a>
<a id='line_672'>    "Set women in his eye and in his walk,</a>
<a id='line_673'>  Among daughters of men the fairest found.</a>
<a id='line_674'>  Many are in each region passing fair</a>
<a id='line_675'>  As the noon sky, more like to goddesses</a>
<a id='line_676'>  Than mortal creatures, graceful and discreet,</a>
<a id='line_677'>  Expert in amorous arts, enchanting tongues</a>
<a id='line_678'>  Persuasive, virgin majesty with mild</a>
<a id='line_679'>  And sweet allayed, yet terrible to approach,                160</a>
<a id='line_680'>  Skilled to retire, and in retiring draw</a>
<a id='line_681'>  Hearts after them tangled in amorous nets.</a>
<a id='line_682'>  Such object hath the power to soften and tame</a>
<a id='line_683'>  Severest temper, smooth the rugged'st brow,</a>
<a id='line_684'>  Enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve,</a>
<a id='line_685'>  Draw out with credulous desire, and lead</a>
<a id='line_686'>  At will the manliest, resolutest breast,</a>
<a id='line_687'>  As the magnetic hardest iron draws.</a>
<a id='line_688'>  Women, when nothing else, beguiled the heart</a>
<a id='line_689'>  Of wisest Solomon, and made him build,                      170</a>
<a id='line_690'>  And made him bow, to the gods of his wives."</a>
<a id='line_691'>    To whom quick answer Satan thus returned:--</a>
<a id='line_692'>  "Belial, in much uneven scale thou weigh'st</a>
<a id='line_693'>  All others by thyself.  Because of old</a>
<a id='line_694'>  Thou thyself doat'st on womankind, admiring</a>
<a id='line_695'>  Their shape, their colour, and attractive grace,</a>
<a id='line_696'>  None are, thou think'st, but taken with such toys.</a>
<a id='line_697'>  Before the Flood, thou, with thy lusty crew,</a>
<a id='line_698'>  False titled Sons of God, roaming the Earth,</a>
<a id='line_699'>  Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men,                   180</a>
<a id='line_700'>  And coupled with them, and begot a race.</a>
<a id='line_701'>  Have we not seen, or by relation heard,</a>
<a id='line_702'>  In courts and regal chambers how thou lurk'st,</a>
<a id='line_703'>  In wood or grove, by mossy fountain-side,</a>
<a id='line_704'>  In valley or green meadow, to waylay</a>
<a id='line_705'>  Some beauty rare, Calisto, Clymene,</a>
<a id='line_706'>  Daphne, or Semele, Antiopa,</a>
<a id='line_707'>  Or Amymone, Syrinx, many more</a>
<a id='line_708'>  Too long--then lay'st thy scapes on names adored,</a>
<a id='line_709'>  Apollo, Neptune, Jupiter, or Pan,                           190</a>
<a id='line_710'>  Satyr, or Faun, or Silvan?  But these haunts</a>
<a id='line_711'>  Delight not all.  Among the sons of men</a>
<a id='line_712'>  How many have with a smile made small account</a>
<a id='line_713'>  Of beauty and her lures, easily scorned</a>
<a id='line_714'>  All her assaults, on worthier things intent!</a>
<a id='line_715'>  Remember that Pellean conqueror,</a>
<a id='line_716'>  A youth, how all the beauties of the East</a>
<a id='line_717'>  He slightly viewed, and slightly overpassed;</a>
<a id='line_718'>  How he surnamed of Africa dismissed,</a>
<a id='line_719'>  In his prime youth, the fair Iberian maid.                  200</a>
<a id='line_720'>  For Solomon, he lived at ease, and, full</a>
<a id='line_721'>  Of honour, wealth, high fare, aimed not beyond</a>
<a id='line_722'>  Higher design than to enjoy his state;</a>
<a id='line_723'>  Thence to the bait of women lay exposed.</a>
<a id='line_724'>  But he whom we attempt is wiser far</a>
<a id='line_725'>  Than Solomon, of more exalted mind,</a>
<a id='line_726'>  Made and set wholly on the accomplishment</a>
<a id='line_727'>  Of greatest things.  What woman will you find,</a>
<a id='line_728'>  Though of this age the wonder and the fame,</a>
<a id='line_729'>  On whom his leisure will voutsafe an eye                    210</a>
<a id='line_730'>  Of fond desire?  Or should she, confident,</a>
<a id='line_731'>  As sitting queen adored on Beauty's throne,</a>
<a id='line_732'>  Descend with all her winning charms begirt</a>
<a id='line_733'>  To enamour, as the zone of Venus once</a>
<a id='line_734'>  Wrought that effect on Jove (so fables tell),</a>
<a id='line_735'>  How would one look from his majestic brow,</a>
<a id='line_736'>  Seated as on the top of Virtue's hill,</a>
<a id='line_737'>  Discountenance her despised, and put to rout</a>
<a id='line_738'>  All her array, her female pride deject,</a>
<a id='line_739'>  Or turn to reverent awe!  For Beauty stands                 220</a>
<a id='line_740'>  In the admiration only of weak minds</a>
<a id='line_741'>  Led captive; cease to admire, and all her plumes</a>
<a id='line_742'>  Fall flat, and shrink into a trivial toy,</a>
<a id='line_743'>  At every sudden slighting quite abashed.</a>
<a id='line_744'>  Therefore with manlier objects we must try</a>
<a id='line_745'>  His constancy--with such as have more shew</a>
<a id='line_746'>  Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise</a>
<a id='line_747'>  (Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wrecked);</a>
<a id='line_748'>  Or that which only seems to satisfy</a>
<a id='line_749'>  Lawful desires of nature, not beyond.                       230</a>
<a id='line_750'>  And now I know he hungers, where no food</a>
<a id='line_751'>  Is to be found, in the wide Wilderness:</a>
<a id='line_752'>  The rest commit to me; I shall let pass</a>
<a id='line_753'>  No advantage, and his strength as oft assay."</a>
<a id='line_754'>    He ceased, and heard their grant in loud acclaim;</a>
<a id='line_755'>  Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band</a>
<a id='line_756'>  Of Spirits likest to himself in guile,</a>
<a id='line_757'>  To be at hand and at his beck appear,</a>
<a id='line_758'>  If cause were to unfold some active scene</a>
<a id='line_759'>  Of various persons, each to know his part;                  240</a>
<a id='line_760'>  Then to the desert takes with these his flight,</a>
<a id='line_761'>  Where still, from shade to shade, the Son of God,</a>
<a id='line_762'>  After forty days' fasting, had remained,</a>
<a id='line_763'>  Now hungering first, and to himself thus said:--</a>
<a id='line_764'>    "Where will this end?  Four times ten days I have passed</a>
<a id='line_765'>  Wandering this woody maze, and human food</a>
<a id='line_766'>  Nor tasted, nor had appetite.  That fast</a>
<a id='line_767'>  To virtue I impute not, or count part</a>
<a id='line_768'>  Of what I suffer here.  If nature need not,</a>
<a id='line_769'>  Or God support nature without repast,                       250</a>
<a id='line_770'>  Though needing, what praise is it to endure?</a>
<a id='line_771'>  But now I feel I hunger; which declares</a>
<a id='line_772'>  Nature hath need of what she asks.  Yet God</a>
<a id='line_773'>  Can satisfy that need some other way,</a>
<a id='line_774'>  Though hunger still remain.  So it remain</a>
<a id='line_775'>  Without this body's wasting, I content me,</a>
<a id='line_776'>  And from the sting of famine fear no harm;</a>
<a id='line_777'>  Nor mind it, fed with better thoughts, that feed</a>
<a id='line_778'>  Me hungering more to do my Father's will."</a>
<a id='line_779'>    It was the hour of night, when thus the Son               260</a>
<a id='line_780'>  Communed in silent walk, then laid him down</a>
<a id='line_781'>  Under the hospitable covert nigh</a>
<a id='line_782'>  Of trees thick interwoven.  There he slept,</a>
<a id='line_783'>  And dreamed, as appetite is wont to dream,</a>
<a id='line_784'>  Of meats and drinks, nature's refreshment sweet.</a>
<a id='line_785'>  Him thought he by the brook of Cherith stood,</a>
<a id='line_786'>  And saw the ravens with their horny beaks</a>
<a id='line_787'>  Food to Elijah bringing even and morn--</a>
<a id='line_788'>  Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought;</a>
<a id='line_789'>  He saw the Prophet also, how he fled                        270</a>
<a id='line_790'>  Into the desert, and how there he slept</a>
<a id='line_791'>  Under a juniper--then how, awaked,</a>
<a id='line_792'>  He found his supper on the coals prepared,</a>
<a id='line_793'>  And by the Angel was bid rise and eat,</a>
<a id='line_794'>  And eat the second time after repose,</a>
<a id='line_795'>  The strength whereof sufficed him forty days:</a>
<a id='line_796'>  Sometimes that with Elijah he partook,</a>
<a id='line_797'>  Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse.</a>
<a id='line_798'>  Thus wore out night; and now the harald Lark</a>
<a id='line_799'>  Left his ground-nest, high towering to descry               280</a>
<a id='line_800'>  The Morn's approach, and greet her with his song.</a>
<a id='line_801'>  As lightly from his grassy couch up rose</a>
<a id='line_802'>  Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream;</a>
<a id='line_803'>  Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting waked.</a>
<a id='line_804'>  Up to a hill anon his steps he reared,</a>
<a id='line_805'>  From whose high top to ken the prospect round,</a>
<a id='line_806'>  If cottage were in view, sheep-cote, or herd;</a>
<a id='line_807'>  But cottage, herd, or sheep-cote, none he saw--</a>
<a id='line_808'>  Only in a bottom saw a pleasant grove,</a>
<a id='line_809'>  With chaunt of tuneful birds resounding loud.               290</a>
<a id='line_810'>  Thither he bent his way, determined there</a>
<a id='line_811'>  To rest at noon, and entered soon the shade</a>
<a id='line_812'>  High-roofed, and walks beneath, and alleys brown,</a>
<a id='line_813'>  That opened in the midst a woody scene;</a>
<a id='line_814'>  Nature's own work it seemed (Nature taught Art),</a>
<a id='line_815'>  And, to a superstitious eye, the haunt</a>
<a id='line_816'>  Of wood-gods and wood-nymphs.  He viewed it round;</a>
<a id='line_817'>  When suddenly a man before him stood,</a>
<a id='line_818'>  Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad,</a>
<a id='line_819'>  As one in city or court or palace bred,                     300</a>
<a id='line_820'>  And with fair speech these words to him addressed:--</a>
<a id='line_821'>    "With granted leave officious I return,</a>
<a id='line_822'>  But much more wonder that the Son of God</a>
<a id='line_823'>  In this wild solitude so long should bide,</a>
<a id='line_824'>  Of all things destitute, and, well I know,</a>
<a id='line_825'>  Not without hunger.  Others of some note,</a>
<a id='line_826'>  As story tells, have trod this wilderness:</a>
<a id='line_827'>  The fugitive Bond-woman, with her son,</a>
<a id='line_828'>  Outcast Nebaioth, yet found here relief</a>
<a id='line_829'>  By a providing Angel; all the race                          310</a>
<a id='line_830'>  Of Israel here had famished, had not God</a>
<a id='line_831'>  Rained from heaven manna; and that Prophet bold,</a>
<a id='line_832'>  Native of Thebez, wandering here, was fed</a>
<a id='line_833'>  Twice by a voice inviting him to eat.</a>
<a id='line_834'>  Of thee those forty days none hath regard,</a>
<a id='line_835'>  Forty and more deserted here indeed."</a>
<a id='line_836'>    To whom thus Jesus:--"What conclud'st thou hence?</a>
<a id='line_837'>  They all had need; I, as thou seest, have none."</a>
<a id='line_838'>    "How hast thou hunger then?" Satan replied.</a>
<a id='line_839'>  "Tell me, if food were now before thee set,                 320</a>
<a id='line_840'>  Wouldst thou not eat?"  "Thereafter as I like</a>
<a id='line_841'>  the giver," answered Jesus.  "Why should that</a>
<a id='line_842'>  Cause thy refusal?" said the subtle Fiend.</a>
<a id='line_843'>  "Hast thou not right to all created things?</a>
<a id='line_844'>  Owe not all creatures, by just right, to thee</a>
<a id='line_845'>  Duty and service, nor to stay till bid,</a>
<a id='line_846'>  But tender all their power?  Nor mention I</a>
<a id='line_847'>  Meats by the law unclean, or offered first</a>
<a id='line_848'>  To idols--those young Daniel could refuse;</a>
<a id='line_849'>  Nor proffered by an enemy--though who                       330</a>
<a id='line_850'>  Would scruple that, with want oppressed?  Behold,</a>
<a id='line_851'>  Nature ashamed, or, better to express,</a>
<a id='line_852'>  Troubled, that thou shouldst hunger, hath purveyed</a>
<a id='line_853'>  From all the elements her choicest store,</a>
<a id='line_854'>  To treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord</a>
<a id='line_855'>  With honour.  Only deign to sit and eat."</a>
<a id='line_856'>    He spake no dream; for, as his words had end,</a>
<a id='line_857'>  Our Saviour, lifting up his eyes, beheld,</a>
<a id='line_858'>  In ample space under the broadest shade,</a>
<a id='line_859'>  A table richly spread in regal mode,                        340</a>
<a id='line_860'>  With dishes piled and meats of noblest sort</a>
<a id='line_861'>  And savour--beasts of chase, or fowl of game,</a>
<a id='line_862'>  In pastry built, or from the spit, or boiled,</a>
<a id='line_863'>  Grisamber-steamed; all fish, from sea or shore,</a>
<a id='line_864'>  Freshet or purling brook, of shell or fin,</a>
<a id='line_865'>  And exquisitest name, for which was drained</a>
<a id='line_866'>  Pontus, and Lucrine bay, and Afric coast.</a>
<a id='line_867'>  Alas! how simple, to these cates compared,</a>
<a id='line_868'>  Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve!</a>
<a id='line_869'>  And at a stately sideboard, by the wine,                    350</a>
<a id='line_870'>  That fragrant smell diffused, in order stood</a>
<a id='line_871'>  Tall stripling youths rich-clad, of fairer hue</a>
<a id='line_872'>  Than Ganymed or Hylas; distant more,</a>
<a id='line_873'>  Under the trees now tripped, now solemn stood,</a>
<a id='line_874'>  Nymphs of Diana's train, and Naiades</a>
<a id='line_875'>  With fruits and flowers from Amalthea's horn,</a>
<a id='line_876'>  And ladies of the Hesperides, that seemed</a>
<a id='line_877'>  Fairer than feigned of old, or fabled since</a>
<a id='line_878'>  Of faery damsels met in forest wide</a>
<a id='line_879'>  By knights of Logres, or of Lyones,                         360</a>
<a id='line_880'>  Lancelot, or Pelleas, or Pellenore.</a>
<a id='line_881'>  And all the while harmonious airs were heard</a>
<a id='line_882'>  Of chiming strings or charming pipes; and winds</a>
<a id='line_883'>  Of gentlest gale Arabian odours fanned</a>
<a id='line_884'>  From their soft wings, and Flora's earliest smells.</a>
<a id='line_885'>  Such was the splendour; and the Tempter now</a>
<a id='line_886'>  His invitation earnestly renewed:--</a>
<a id='line_887'>    "What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat?</a>

<a id='line_908'>  And with my hunger what hast thou to do?</a>
<a id='line_909'>  Thy pompous delicacies I contemn,                           390</a>
<a id='line_910'>  And count thy specious gifts no gifts, but guiles."</a>
<a id='line_911'>    To whom thus answered Satan, male-content:--</a>

<a id='line_921'>  Both table and provision vanished quite,</a>
<a id='line_922'>  With sound of harpies' wings and talons heard;</a>
<a id='line_923'>  Only the importune Tempter still remained,</a>

<a id='line_936'>  Which way, or from what hope, dost thou aspire</a>
<a id='line_937'>  To greatness? whence authority deriv'st?</a>
<a id='line_938'>  What followers, what retinue canst thou gain,</a>

<a id='line_985'>  Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules</a>

<a id='line_1821'>    So spake the Son of God; but Satan, now</a>
<a id='line_1822'>  Quite at a loss (for all his darts were spent),</a>
<a id='line_1823'>  Thus to our Saviour, with stern brow, replied:--</a>

<a id='line_1827'>  Or active, tended on by glory or fame,</a>
<a id='line_1828'>  What dost thou in this world?  The Wilderness</a>
<a id='line_1829'>  For thee is fittest place: I found thee there,</a>
<a id='line_1830'>  And thither will return thee.  Yet remember</a>
<a id='line_1831'>  What I foretell thee; soon thou shalt have cause</a>
<a id='line_1832'>  To wish thou never hadst rejected, thus</a>
<a id='line_1833'>  Nicely or cautiously, my offered aid,</a>
<a id='line_1834'>  Which would have set thee in short time with ease</a>
<a id='line_1835'>  On David's throne, or throne of all the world,</a>
<a id='line_1836'>  Now at full age, fulness of time, thy season,               380</a>
<a id='line_1837'>  When prophecies of thee are best fulfilled.</a>
<a id='line_1838'>  Now, contrary--if I read aught in heaven,</a>
<a id='line_1839'>  Or heaven write aught of fate--by what the stars</a>
<a id='line_1840'>  Voluminous, or single characters</a>
<a id='line_1841'>  In their conjunction met, give me to spell,</a>
<a id='line_1842'>  Sorrows and labours, opposition, hate,</a>
<a id='line_1843'>  Attends thee; scorns, reproaches, injuries,</a>
<a id='line_1844'>  Violence and stripes, and, lastly, cruel death.</a>
<a id='line_1845'>  A kingdom they portend thee, but what kingdom,</a>
<a id='line_1846'>  Real or allegoric, I discern not;                           390</a>
<a id='line_1847'>  Nor when: eternal sure--as without end,</a>
<a id='line_1848'>  Without beginning; for no date prefixed</a>
<a id='line_1849'>  Directs me in the starry rubric set."</a>
<a id='line_1850'>    So saying, he took (for still he knew his power</a>
<a id='line_1851'>  Not yet expired), and to the Wilderness</a>
<a id='line_1852'>  Brought back, the Son of God, and left him there,</a>
<a id='line_1853'>  Feigning to disappear.  Darkness now rose,</a>
<a id='line_1854'>  As daylight sunk, and brought in louring Night,</a>
<a id='line_1855'>  Her shadowy offspring, unsubstantial both,</a>
<a id='line_1856'>  Privation mere of light and absent day.                     400</a>
<a id='line_1857'>  Our Saviour, meek, and with untroubled mind</a>
<a id='line_1858'>  After hisaerie jaunt, though hurried sore,</a>
<a id='line_1859'>  Hungry and cold, betook him to his rest,</a>

<a id='line_1861'>  Whose branching arms thick intertwined might shield</a>
<a id='line_1862'>  From dews and damps of night his sheltered head;</a>
<a id='line_1863'>  But, sheltered, slept in vain; for at his head</a>
<a id='line_1864'>  The Tempter watched, and soon with ugly dreams</a>
<a id='line_1865'>  Disturbed his sleep.  And either tropic now</a>
<a id='line_1866'>  'Gan thunder, and both ends of heaven; the clouds           410</a>

<a id='line_1868'>  Fierce rain with lightning mixed, water with fire,</a>
<a id='line_1869'>  In ruin reconciled; nor slept the winds</a>
<a id='line_1870'>  Within their stony caves, but rushed abroad</a>
<a id='line_1871'>  From the four hinges of the world, and fell</a>
<a id='line_1872'>  On the vexed wilderness, whose tallest pines,</a>
<a id='line_1873'>  Though rooted deep as high, and sturdiest oaks,</a>
<a id='line_1874'>  Bowed their stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts,</a>
<a id='line_1875'>  Or torn up sheer.  Ill wast thou shrouded then,</a>
<a id='line_1876'>  O patient Son of God, yet only stood'st                     420</a>
<a id='line_1877'>  Unshaken!  Nor yet staid the terror there:</a>
<a id='line_1878'>  Infernal ghosts and hellish furies round</a>
<a id='line_1879'>  Environed thee; some howled, some yelled, some shrieked,</a>
<a id='line_1880'>  Some bent at thee their fiery darts, while thou</a>
<a id='line_1881'>  Sat'st unappalled in calm and sinless peace.</a>
<a id='line_1882'>  Thus passed the night so foul, till Morning fair</a>
<a id='line_1883'>  Came forth with pilgrim steps, in amice grey,</a>
<a id='line_1884'>  Who with her radiant finger stilled the roar</a>
<a id='line_1885'>  Of thunder, chased the clouds, and laid the winds,</a>
<a id='line_1886'>  And griesly spectres, which the Fiend had raised            430</a>
<a id='line_1887'>  To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire.</a>
<a id='line_1888'>  And now the sun with more effectual beams</a>
<a id='line_1889'>  Had cheered the face of earth, and dried the wet</a>
<a id='line_1890'>  From drooping plant, or dropping tree; the birds,</a>
<a id='line_1891'>  Who all things now behold more fresh and green,</a>
<a id='line_1892'>  After a night of storm so ruinous,</a>
<a id='line_1893'>  Cleared up their choicest notes in bush and spray,</a>
<a id='line_1894'>  To gratulate the sweet return of morn.</a>
<a id='line_1895'>  Nor yet, amidst this joy and brightest morn,</a>
<a id='line_1896'>  Was absent, after all his mischief done,                    440</a>
<a id='line_1897'>  The Prince of Darkness; glad would also seem</a>
<a id='line_1898'>  Of this fair change, and to our Saviour came;</a>
<a id='line_1899'>  Yet with no new device (they all were spent),</a>
<a id='line_1900'>  Rather by this his last affront resolved,</a>
<a id='line_1901'>  Desperate of better course, to vent his rage</a>
<a id='line_1902'>  And mad despite to be so oft repelled.</a>
<a id='line_1903'>  Him walking on a sunny hill he found,</a>
<a id='line_1904'>  Backed on the north and west by a thick wood;</a>
<a id='line_1905'>  Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape,</a>
<a id='line_1906'>  And in a careless mood thus to him said:--                  450</a>
<a id='line_1907'>    "Fair morning yet betides thee, Son of God,</a>
<a id='line_1908'>  After a dismal night.  I heard the wrack,</a>
<a id='line_1909'>  As earth and sky would mingle; but myself</a>
<a id='line_1910'>  Was distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear them,</a>
<a id='line_1911'>  As dangerous to the pillared frame of Heaven,</a>
<a id='line_1912'>  Or to the Earth's dark basis underneath,</a>
<a id='line_1913'>  Are to the main as inconsiderable</a>
<a id='line_1914'>  And harmless, if not wholesome, as a sneeze</a>

<a id='line_1916'>  Yet, as being ofttimes noxious where they light             460</a>
<a id='line_1917'>  On man, beast, plant, wasteful and turbulent,</a>
<a id='line_1918'>  Like turbulencies in the affairs of men,</a>
<a id='line_1919'>  Over whose heads they roar, and seem to point,</a>
<a id='line_1920'>  They oft fore-signify and threaten ill.</a>
<a id='line_1921'>  This tempest at this desert most was bent;</a>
<a id='line_1922'>  Of men at thee, for only thou here dwell'st.</a>
<a id='line_1923'>  Did I not tell thee, if thou didst reject</a>
<a id='line_1924'>  The perfect season offered with my aid</a>
<a id='line_1925'>  To win thy destined seat, but wilt prolong</a>
<a id='line_1926'>  All to the push of fate, pursue thy way                     470</a>
<a id='line_1927'>  Of gaining David's throne no man knows when</a>
<a id='line_1928'>  (For both the when and how is nowhere told),</a>
<a id='line_1929'>  Thou shalt be what thou art ordained, no doubt;</a>
<a id='line_1930'>  For Angels have proclaimed it, but concealing</a>
<a id='line_1931'>  The time and means?  Each act is rightliest done</a>
<a id='line_1932'>  Not when it must, but when it may be best.</a>
<a id='line_1933'>  If thou observe not this, be sure to find</a>
<a id='line_1934'>  What I foretold thee--many a hard assay</a>
<a id='line_1935'>  Of dangers, and adversities, and pains,</a>
<a id='line_1936'>  Ere thou of Israel's sceptre get fast hold;                 480</a>
<a id='line_1937'>  Whereof this ominous night that closed thee round,</a>
<a id='line_1938'>  So many terrors, voices, prodigies,</a>
<a id='line_1939'>  May warn thee, as a sure foregoing sign."</a>
<a id='line_1940'>    So talked he, while the Son of God went on,</a>
<a id='line_1941'>  And staid not, but in brief him answered thus:--</a>
<a id='line_1942'>    "Me worse than wet thou find'st not; other harm</a>
<a id='line_1943'>  Those terrors which thou speak'st of did me none.</a>
<a id='line_1944'>  I never feared they could, though noising loud</a>
<a id='line_1945'>  And threatening nigh: what they can do as signs</a>
<a id='line_1946'>  Betokening or ill-boding I contemn                          490</a>
<a id='line_1947'>  As false portents, not sent from God, but thee;</a>
<a id='line_1948'>  Who, knowing I shall reign past thy preventing,</a>
<a id='line_1949'>  Obtrud'st thy offered aid, that I, accepting,</a>
<a id='line_1950'>  At least might seem to hold all power of thee,</a>
<a id='line_1951'>  Ambitious Spirit! and would'st be thought my God;</a>
<a id='line_1952'>  And storm'st, refused, thinking to terrify</a>
<a id='line_1953'>  Me to thy will!  Desist (thou art discerned,</a>
<a id='line_1954'>  And toil'st in vain), nor me in vain molest."</a>
<a id='line_1955'>    To whom the Fiend, now swoln with rage, replied:--</a>
<a id='line_1956'>  "Then hear, O Son of David, virgin-born!                    500</a>
<a id='line_1957'>  For Son of God to me is yet in doubt.</a>

<a id='line_1963'>  From that time seldom have I ceased to eye</a>
<a id='line_1964'>  Thy infancy, thy childhood, and thy youth,</a>
<a id='line_1965'>  Thy manhood last, though yet in private bred;</a>
<a id='line_1966'>  Till, at the ford of Jordan, whither all                    510</a>
<a id='line_1967'>  Flocked to the Baptist, I among the rest</a>
<a id='line_1968'>  (Though not to be baptized), by voice from Heaven</a>
<a id='line_1969'>  Heard thee pronounced the Son of God beloved.</a>
<a id='line_1970'>  Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view</a>
<a id='line_1971'>  And narrower scrutiny, that I might learn</a>
<a id='line_1972'>  In what degree or meaning thou art called</a>
<a id='line_1973'>  The Son of God, which bears no single sense.</a>
<a id='line_1974'>  The Son of God I also am, or was;</a>
<a id='line_1975'>  And, if I was, I am; relation stands:</a>
<a id='line_1976'>  All men are Sons of God; yet thee I thought                 520</a>
<a id='line_1977'>  In some respect far higher so declared.</a>
<a id='line_1978'>  Therefore I watched thy footsteps from that hour,</a>

<a id='line_1980'>  Where, by all best conjectures, I collect</a>
<a id='line_1981'>  Thou art to be my fatal enemy.</a>
<a id='line_1982'>  Good reason, then, if I beforehand seek</a>
<a id='line_1983'>  To understand my adversary, who</a>

<a id='line_1985'>  By parle or composition, truce or league,</a>
<a id='line_1986'>  To win him, or win from him what I can.                     530</a>
<a id='line_1987'>  And opportunity I here have had</a>
<a id='line_1988'>  To try thee, sift thee, and confess have found thee</a>
<a id='line_1989'>  Proof against all temptation, as a rock</a>

<a id='line_1991'>  To the utmost of mere man both wise and good,</a>
<a id='line_1992'>  Not more; for honours, riches, kingdoms, glory,</a>
<a id='line_1993'>  Have been before contemned, and may again.</a>
<a id='line_1994'>  Therefore, to know what more thou art than man,</a>
<a id='line_1995'>  Worth naming the Son of God by voice from Heaven,</a>
<a id='line_1996'>  Another method I must now begin."                           540</a>
<a id='line_1997'>    So saying, he caught him up, and, without wing</a>
<a id='line_1998'>  Of hippogrif, bore through the air sublime,</a>
<a id='line_1999'>  Over the wilderness and o'er the plain,</a>
<a id='line_2000'>  Till underneath them fair Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_2001'>  The Holy City, lifted high her towers,</a>
<a id='line_2002'>  And higher yet the glorious Temple reared</a>
<a id='line_2003'>  Her pile, far off appearing like a mount</a>
<a id='line_2004'>  Of alablaster, topt with golden spires:</a>
<a id='line_2005'>  There, on the highest pinnacle, he set</a>
<a id='line_2006'>  The Son of God, and added thus in scorn:--                  550</a>
<a id='line_2007'>    "There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright</a>

<a id='line_2026'>  Renewing fresh assaults, amidst his pride                   570</a>
<a id='line_2027'>  Fell whence he stood to see his victor fall;</a>

<a id='line_2032'>  So, strook with dread and anguish, fell the Fiend,</a>
<a id='line_2033'>  And to his crew, that sat consulting, brought</a>
<a id='line_2034'>  Joyless triumphals of his hoped success,</a>
<a id='line_2035'>  Ruin, and desperation, and dismay,</a>
<a id='line_2036'>  Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God.                  580</a>
<a id='line_2037'>  So Satan fell; and straight a fiery globe</a>
<a id='line_2038'>  Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh,</a>
<a id='line_2039'>  Who on their plumy vans received Him soft</a>
<a id='line_2040'>  From his uneasy station, and upbore,</a>
<a id='line_2041'>  As on a floating couch, through the blithe air;</a>
<a id='line_2042'>  Then, in a flowery valley, set him down</a>
<a id='line_2043'>  On a green bank, and set before him spread</a>
<a id='line_2044'>  A table of celestial food, divine</a>
<a id='line_2045'>  Ambrosial fruits fetched from the Tree of Life,</a>
<a id='line_2046'>  And from the Fount of Life ambrosial drink,                 590</a>
<a id='line_2047'>  That soon refreshed him wearied, and repaired</a>
<a id='line_2048'>  What hunger, if aught hunger, had impaired,</a>
<a id='line_2049'>  Or thirst; and, as he fed, Angelic quires</a>
<a id='line_2050'>  Sung heavenly anthems of his victory</a>
<a id='line_2051'>  Over temptation and the Tempter proud:--</a>
<a id='line_2052'>    "True Image of the Father, whether throned</a>
<a id='line_2053'>  In the bosom of bliss, and light of light</a>
<a id='line_2054'>  Conceiving, or, remote from Heaven, enshrined</a>
<a id='line_2055'>  In fleshly tabernacle and human form,</a>
<a id='line_2056'>  Wandering the wilderness--whatever place,                   600</a>
<a id='line_2057'>  Habit, or state, or motion, still expressing</a>
<a id='line_2058'>  The Son of God, with Godlike force endued</a>
<a id='line_2059'>  Against the attempter of thy Father's throne</a>
<a id='line_2060'>  And thief of Paradise!  Him long of old</a>
<a id='line_2061'>  Thou didst debel, and down from Heaven cast</a>
<a id='line_2062'>  With all his army; now thou hast avenged</a>
<a id='line_2063'>  Supplanted Adam, and, by vanquishing</a>
<a id='line_2064'>  Temptation, hast regained lost Paradise,</a>
<a id='line_2065'>  And frustrated the conquest fraudulent.</a>
<a id='line_2066'>  He never more henceforth will dare set foot                 610</a>
<a id='line_2067'>  In paradise to tempt; his snares are broke.</a>
<a id='line_2068'>  For, though that seat of earthly bliss be failed,</a>
<a id='line_2069'>  A fairer Paradise is founded now</a>
<a id='line_2070'>  For Adam and his chosen sons, whom thou,</a>
<a id='line_2071'>  A Saviour, art come down to reinstall;</a>
<a id='line_2072'>  Where they shall dwell secure, when time shall be,</a>
<a id='line_2073'>  Of tempter and temptation without fear.</a>
<a id='line_2074'>  But thou, Infernal Serpent! shalt not long</a>
<a id='line_2075'>  Rule in the clouds.  Like an autumnal star,</a>
<a id='line_2076'>  Or lightning, thou shalt fall from Heaven, trod down        620</a>
<a id='line_2077'>  Under his feet.  For proof, ere this thou feel'st</a>
<a id='line_2078'>  Thy wound (yet not thy last and deadliest wound)</a>
<a id='line_2079'>  By this repulse received, and hold'st in Hell</a>
<a id='line_2080'>  No triumph; in all her gates Abaddon rues</a>
<a id='line_2081'>  Thy bold attempt.  Hereafter learn with awe</a>
<a id='line_2082'>  To dread the Son of God.  He, all unarmed,</a>
<a id='line_2083'>  Shall chase thee, with the terror of his voice,</a>
<a id='line_2084'>  From thy demoniac holds, possession foul--</a>
<a id='line_2085'>  Thee and thy legions; yelling they shall fly,</a>
<a id='line_2086'>  And beg to hide them in a herd of swine,                    630</a>
<a id='line_2087'>  Lest he command them down into the Deep,</a>
<a id='line_2088'>  Bound, and to torment sent before their time.</a>
<a id='line_2089'>  Hail, Son of the Most High, heir of both Worlds,</a>
<a id='line_2090'>  Queller of Satan!  On thy glorious work</a>
<a id='line_2091'>  Now enter, and begin to save Mankind."</a>
<a id='line_2092'>    Thus they the Son of God, our Saviour meek,</a>
<a id='line_2093'>  Sung victor, and, from heavenly feast refreshed,</a>
<a id='line_2094'>  Brought on his way with joy.  He, unobserved,</a>
<a id='line_2095'>  Home to his mother's house private returned.</a>
