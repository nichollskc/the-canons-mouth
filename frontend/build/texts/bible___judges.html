<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the children</a>
<a id='line_4'>of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us against the</a>
<a id='line_5'>Canaanites first, to fight against them?  1:2 And the LORD said, Judah</a>
<a id='line_6'>shall go up: behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.</a>
<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>1:3 And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my</a>
<a id='line_9'>lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go</a>
<a id='line_10'>with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.</a>
<a id='line_11'></a>
<a id='line_12'>1:4 And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and the</a>
<a id='line_13'>Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek ten</a>
<a id='line_14'>thousand men.</a>
<a id='line_15'></a>
<a id='line_16'>1:5 And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against him,</a>
<a id='line_17'>and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</a>
<a id='line_18'></a>
<a id='line_19'>1:6 But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him,</a>
<a id='line_20'>and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</a>
<a id='line_21'></a>
<a id='line_22'>1:7 And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their thumbs</a>
<a id='line_23'>and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under my table: as I</a>
<a id='line_24'>have done, so God hath requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem,</a>
<a id='line_25'>and there he died.</a>
<a id='line_26'></a>
<a id='line_27'>1:8 Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and had</a>
<a id='line_28'>taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and set the city</a>
<a id='line_29'>on fire.</a>
<a id='line_30'></a>
<a id='line_31'>1:9 And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the</a>
<a id='line_32'>Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south, and in the</a>
<a id='line_33'>valley.</a>
<a id='line_34'></a>
<a id='line_35'>1:10 And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron: (now</a>
<a id='line_36'>the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew Sheshai, and</a>
<a id='line_37'>Ahiman, and Talmai.</a>
<a id='line_38'></a>
<a id='line_39'>1:11 And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and the</a>
<a id='line_40'>name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher: 1:12 And Caleb said, He that</a>
<a id='line_41'>smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it, to him will I give Achsah my</a>
<a id='line_42'>daughter to wife.</a>
<a id='line_43'></a>
<a id='line_44'>1:13 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, took it:</a>
<a id='line_45'>and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</a>
<a id='line_46'></a>
<a id='line_47'>1:14 And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him to</a>
<a id='line_48'>ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her ass; and Caleb</a>
<a id='line_49'>said unto her, What wilt thou?  1:15 And she said unto him, Give me a</a>
<a id='line_50'>blessing: for thou hast given me a south land; give me also springs of</a>
<a id='line_51'>water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.</a>
<a id='line_52'></a>
<a id='line_53'>1:16 And the children of the Kenite, Moses’ father in law, went up out</a>
<a id='line_54'>of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into the</a>
<a id='line_55'>wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and they went</a>
<a id='line_56'>and dwelt among the people.</a>
<a id='line_57'></a>
<a id='line_58'>1:17 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the</a>
<a id='line_59'>Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the</a>
<a id='line_60'>name of the city was called Hormah.</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>1:18 Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with the</a>
<a id='line_63'>coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.</a>
<a id='line_64'></a>
<a id='line_65'>1:19 And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants of</a>
<a id='line_66'>the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley,</a>
<a id='line_67'>because they had chariots of iron.</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>1:20 And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he expelled</a>
<a id='line_70'>thence the three sons of Anak.</a>
<a id='line_71'></a>
<a id='line_72'>1:21 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that</a>
<a id='line_73'>inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children of</a>
<a id='line_74'>Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>1:22 And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and</a>
<a id='line_77'>the LORD was with them.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>1:23 And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of</a>
<a id='line_80'>the city before was Luz.)  1:24 And the spies saw a man come forth out</a>
<a id='line_81'>of the city, and they said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the</a>
<a id='line_82'>entrance into the city, and we will shew thee mercy.</a>
<a id='line_83'></a>
<a id='line_84'>1:25 And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote</a>
<a id='line_85'>the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man and all</a>
<a id='line_86'>his family.</a>
<a id='line_87'></a>
<a id='line_88'>1:26 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city,</a>
<a id='line_89'>and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name thereof unto this</a>
<a id='line_90'>day.</a>
<a id='line_91'></a>
<a id='line_92'>1:27 Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean and</a>
<a id='line_93'>her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and</a>
<a id='line_94'>her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her towns, nor the</a>
<a id='line_95'>inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the Canaanites would dwell</a>
<a id='line_96'>in that land.</a>
<a id='line_97'></a>
<a id='line_98'>1:28 And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the</a>
<a id='line_99'>Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>1:29 Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer;</a>
<a id='line_102'>but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</a>
<a id='line_103'></a>
<a id='line_104'>1:30 Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the</a>
<a id='line_105'>inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and</a>
<a id='line_106'>became tributaries.</a>
<a id='line_107'></a>
<a id='line_108'>1:31 Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the</a>
<a id='line_109'>inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor</a>
<a id='line_110'>of Aphik, nor of Rehob: 1:32 But the Asherites dwelt among the</a>
<a id='line_111'>Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: for they did not drive them</a>
<a id='line_112'>out.</a>
<a id='line_113'></a>
<a id='line_114'>1:33 Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh,</a>
<a id='line_115'>nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the Canaanites,</a>
<a id='line_116'>the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the inhabitants of</a>
<a id='line_117'>Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries unto them.</a>
<a id='line_118'></a>
<a id='line_119'>1:34 And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain:</a>
<a id='line_120'>for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley: 1:35 But</a>
<a id='line_121'>the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim:</a>
<a id='line_122'>yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became</a>
<a id='line_123'>tributaries.</a>
<a id='line_124'></a>
<a id='line_125'>1:36 And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to Akrabbim,</a>
<a id='line_126'>from the rock, and upward.</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>2:1 And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said,</a>
<a id='line_129'>I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you unto the land</a>
<a id='line_130'>which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I will never break my</a>
<a id='line_131'>covenant with you.</a>
<a id='line_132'></a>
<a id='line_133'>2:2 And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land; ye</a>
<a id='line_134'>shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my voice: why</a>
<a id='line_135'>have ye done this?  2:3 Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them</a>
<a id='line_136'>out from before you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and</a>
<a id='line_137'>their gods shall be a snare unto you.</a>
<a id='line_138'></a>
<a id='line_139'>2:4 And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these words</a>
<a id='line_140'>unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their</a>
<a id='line_141'>voice, and wept.</a>
<a id='line_142'></a>
<a id='line_143'>2:5 And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they sacrificed</a>
<a id='line_144'>there unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_145'></a>
<a id='line_146'>2:6 And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel went</a>
<a id='line_147'>every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.</a>
<a id='line_148'></a>
<a id='line_149'>2:7 And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the</a>
<a id='line_150'>days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great</a>
<a id='line_151'>works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.</a>
<a id='line_152'></a>
<a id='line_153'>2:8 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an</a>
<a id='line_154'>hundred and ten years old.</a>
<a id='line_155'></a>
<a id='line_156'>2:9 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in</a>
<a id='line_157'>Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of the hill</a>
<a id='line_158'>Gaash.</a>
<a id='line_159'></a>
<a id='line_160'>2:10 And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers:</a>
<a id='line_161'>and there arose another generation after them, which knew not the</a>
<a id='line_162'>LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>2:11 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_165'>served Baalim: 2:12 And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers,</a>
<a id='line_166'>which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods,</a>
<a id='line_167'>of the gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed</a>
<a id='line_168'>themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>2:13 And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>2:14 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he</a>
<a id='line_173'>delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them, and he</a>
<a id='line_174'>sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they</a>
<a id='line_175'>could not any longer stand before their enemies.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>2:15 Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against</a>
<a id='line_178'>them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn unto</a>
<a id='line_179'>them: and they were greatly distressed.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>2:16 Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them out</a>
<a id='line_182'>of the hand of those that spoiled them.</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>2:17 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they went a</a>
<a id='line_185'>whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto them: they turned</a>
<a id='line_186'>quickly out of the way which their fathers walked in, obeying the</a>
<a id='line_187'>commandments of the LORD; but they did not so.</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>2:18 And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with</a>
<a id='line_190'>the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the</a>
<a id='line_191'>days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings</a>
<a id='line_192'>by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.</a>
<a id='line_193'></a>
<a id='line_194'>2:19 And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they returned,</a>
<a id='line_195'>and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in following other</a>
<a id='line_196'>gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them; they ceased not from</a>
<a id='line_197'>their own doings, nor from their stubborn way.</a>
<a id='line_198'></a>
<a id='line_199'>2:20 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said,</a>
<a id='line_200'>Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I</a>
<a id='line_201'>commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice; 2:21 I</a>
<a id='line_202'>also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations</a>
<a id='line_203'>which Joshua left when he died: 2:22 That through them I may prove</a>
<a id='line_204'>Israel, whether they will keep the way of the LORD to walk therein, as</a>
<a id='line_205'>their fathers did keep it, or not.</a>
<a id='line_206'></a>
<a id='line_207'>2:23 Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them out</a>
<a id='line_208'>hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.</a>
<a id='line_209'></a>
<a id='line_210'>3:1 Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel by</a>
<a id='line_211'>them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars of Canaan;</a>
<a id='line_212'>3:2 Only that the generations of the children of Israel might know, to</a>
<a id='line_213'>teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof; 3:3</a>
<a id='line_214'>Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the</a>
<a id='line_215'>Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount</a>
<a id='line_216'>Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.</a>
<a id='line_217'></a>
<a id='line_218'>3:4 And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would</a>
<a id='line_219'>hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their</a>
<a id='line_220'>fathers by the hand of Moses.</a>
<a id='line_221'></a>
<a id='line_222'>3:5 And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites,</a>
<a id='line_223'>and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites: 3:6 And they</a>
<a id='line_224'>took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to</a>
<a id='line_225'>their sons, and served their gods.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>3:7 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_228'>forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.</a>
<a id='line_229'></a>
<a id='line_230'>3:8 Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he</a>
<a id='line_231'>sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia: and</a>
<a id='line_232'>the children of Israel served Chushanrishathaim eight years.</a>
<a id='line_233'></a>
<a id='line_234'>3:9 And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD</a>
<a id='line_235'>raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them,</a>
<a id='line_236'>even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother.</a>
<a id='line_237'></a>
<a id='line_238'>3:10 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel,</a>
<a id='line_239'>and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of</a>
<a id='line_240'>Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed against</a>
<a id='line_241'>Chushanrishathaim.</a>
<a id='line_242'></a>
<a id='line_243'>3:11 And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz</a>
<a id='line_244'>died.</a>
<a id='line_245'></a>
<a id='line_246'>3:12 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the</a>
<a id='line_247'>LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel,</a>
<a id='line_248'>because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_249'></a>
<a id='line_250'>3:13 And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and</a>
<a id='line_251'>went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.</a>
<a id='line_252'></a>
<a id='line_253'>3:14 So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen</a>
<a id='line_254'>years.</a>
<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'>3:15 But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD</a>
<a id='line_257'>raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man</a>
<a id='line_258'>lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a present unto</a>
<a id='line_259'>Eglon the king of Moab.</a>
<a id='line_260'></a>
<a id='line_261'>3:16 But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit</a>
<a id='line_262'>length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>3:17 And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon was</a>
<a id='line_265'>a very fat man.</a>
<a id='line_266'></a>
<a id='line_267'>3:18 And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away</a>
<a id='line_268'>the people that bare the present.</a>
<a id='line_269'></a>
<a id='line_270'>3:19 But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by</a>
<a id='line_271'>Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said,</a>
<a id='line_272'>Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him.</a>
<a id='line_273'></a>
<a id='line_274'>3:20 And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour,</a>
<a id='line_275'>which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from</a>
<a id='line_276'>God unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_277'></a>
<a id='line_278'>And he arose out of his seat.</a>
<a id='line_279'></a>
<a id='line_280'>3:21 And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his</a>
<a id='line_281'>right thigh, and thrust it into his belly: 3:22 And the haft also went</a>
<a id='line_282'>in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he</a>
<a id='line_283'>could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out.</a>
<a id='line_284'></a>
<a id='line_285'>3:23 Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the</a>
<a id='line_286'>parlour upon him, and locked them.</a>
<a id='line_287'></a>
<a id='line_288'>3:24 When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that,</a>
<a id='line_289'>behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he</a>
<a id='line_290'>covereth his feet in his summer chamber.</a>
<a id='line_291'></a>
<a id='line_292'>3:25 And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened</a>
<a id='line_293'>not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened</a>
<a id='line_294'>them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</a>
<a id='line_295'></a>
<a id='line_296'>3:26 And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the</a>
<a id='line_297'>quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.</a>
<a id='line_298'></a>
<a id='line_299'>3:27 And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in</a>
<a id='line_300'>the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him</a>
<a id='line_301'>from the mount, and he before them.</a>
<a id='line_302'></a>
<a id='line_303'>3:28 And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath</a>
<a id='line_304'>delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down</a>
<a id='line_305'>after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab, and suffered not</a>
<a id='line_306'>a man to pass over.</a>
<a id='line_307'></a>
<a id='line_308'>3:29 And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all</a>
<a id='line_309'>lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.</a>
<a id='line_310'></a>
<a id='line_311'>3:30 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the</a>
<a id='line_312'>land had rest fourscore years.</a>
<a id='line_313'></a>
<a id='line_314'>3:31 And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the</a>
<a id='line_315'>Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered</a>
<a id='line_316'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_317'></a>
<a id='line_318'>4:1 And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the</a>
<a id='line_319'>LORD, when Ehud was dead.</a>
<a id='line_320'></a>
<a id='line_321'>4:2 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, that</a>
<a id='line_322'>reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera, which dwelt in</a>
<a id='line_323'>Harosheth of the Gentiles.</a>
<a id='line_324'></a>
<a id='line_325'>4:3 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had nine</a>
<a id='line_326'>hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed the</a>
<a id='line_327'>children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_328'></a>
<a id='line_329'>4:4 And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel</a>
<a id='line_330'>at that time.</a>
<a id='line_331'></a>
<a id='line_332'>4:5 And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and</a>
<a id='line_333'>Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to her for</a>
<a id='line_334'>judgment.</a>
<a id='line_335'></a>
<a id='line_336'>4:6 And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of</a>
<a id='line_337'>Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of Israel</a>
<a id='line_338'>commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and take with thee</a>
<a id='line_339'>ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and of the children of</a>
<a id='line_340'>Zebulun?  4:7 And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera,</a>
<a id='line_341'>the captain of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his multitude; and</a>
<a id='line_342'>I will deliver him into thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_343'></a>
<a id='line_344'>4:8 And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will go:</a>
<a id='line_345'>but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.</a>
<a id='line_346'></a>
<a id='line_347'>4:9 And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the</a>
<a id='line_348'>journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for the LORD</a>
<a id='line_349'>shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and</a>
<a id='line_350'>went with Barak to Kedesh.</a>
<a id='line_351'></a>
<a id='line_352'>4:10 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went up</a>
<a id='line_353'>with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with him.</a>
<a id='line_354'></a>
<a id='line_355'>4:11 Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the</a>
<a id='line_356'>father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites, and</a>
<a id='line_357'>pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by Kedesh.</a>
<a id='line_358'></a>
<a id='line_359'>4:12 And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up</a>
<a id='line_360'>to mount Tabor.</a>
<a id='line_361'></a>
<a id='line_362'>4:13 And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred</a>
<a id='line_363'>chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from</a>
<a id='line_364'>Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.</a>
<a id='line_365'></a>
<a id='line_366'>4:14 And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which the</a>
<a id='line_367'>LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the LORD gone out</a>
<a id='line_368'>before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men</a>
<a id='line_369'>after him.</a>
<a id='line_370'></a>
<a id='line_371'>4:15 And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all</a>
<a id='line_372'>his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that Sisera</a>
<a id='line_373'>lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his feet.</a>
<a id='line_374'></a>
<a id='line_375'>4:16 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto</a>
<a id='line_376'>Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell upon the</a>
<a id='line_377'>edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.</a>
<a id='line_378'></a>
<a id='line_379'>4:17 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife</a>
<a id='line_380'>of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin the king of</a>
<a id='line_381'>Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</a>
<a id='line_382'></a>
<a id='line_383'>4:18 And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in, my</a>
<a id='line_384'>lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in unto her into</a>
<a id='line_385'>the tent, she covered him with a mantle.</a>
<a id='line_386'></a>
<a id='line_387'>4:19 And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to</a>
<a id='line_388'>drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him</a>
<a id='line_389'>drink, and covered him.</a>
<a id='line_390'></a>
<a id='line_391'>4:20 Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it</a>
<a id='line_392'>shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say, Is</a>
<a id='line_393'>there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.</a>
<a id='line_394'></a>
<a id='line_395'>4:21 Then Jael Heber’s wife took a nail of the tent, and took an</a>
<a id='line_396'>hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the nail into</a>
<a id='line_397'>his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he was fast asleep</a>
<a id='line_398'>and weary. So he died.</a>
<a id='line_399'></a>
<a id='line_400'>4:22 And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him,</a>
<a id='line_401'>and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou</a>
<a id='line_402'>seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold, Sisera lay dead, and</a>
<a id='line_403'>the nail was in his temples.</a>
<a id='line_404'></a>
<a id='line_405'>4:23 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the</a>
<a id='line_406'>children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_407'></a>
<a id='line_408'>4:24 And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and prevailed</a>
<a id='line_409'>against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed Jabin king</a>
<a id='line_410'>of Canaan.</a>
<a id='line_411'></a>
<a id='line_412'>5:1 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,</a>
<a id='line_413'>saying, 5:2 Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the</a>
<a id='line_414'>people willingly offered themselves.</a>
<a id='line_415'></a>
<a id='line_416'>5:3 Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing</a>
<a id='line_417'>unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_418'></a>
<a id='line_419'>5:4 LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out of</a>
<a id='line_420'>the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the</a>
<a id='line_421'>clouds also dropped water.</a>
<a id='line_422'></a>
<a id='line_423'>5:5 The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai from</a>
<a id='line_424'>before the LORD God of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_425'></a>
<a id='line_426'>5:6 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the</a>
<a id='line_427'>highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked through byways.</a>
<a id='line_428'></a>
<a id='line_429'>5:7 The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel,</a>
<a id='line_430'>until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.</a>
<a id='line_431'></a>
<a id='line_432'>5:8 They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a shield</a>
<a id='line_433'>or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?  5:9 My heart is toward</a>
<a id='line_434'>the governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the</a>
<a id='line_435'>people. Bless ye the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_436'></a>
<a id='line_437'>5:10 Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment, and</a>
<a id='line_438'>walk by the way.</a>
<a id='line_439'></a>
<a id='line_440'>5:11 They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the places</a>
<a id='line_441'>of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the righteous acts of the</a>
<a id='line_442'>LORD, even the righteous acts toward the inhabitants of his villages</a>
<a id='line_443'>in Israel: then shall the people of the LORD go down to the gates.</a>
<a id='line_444'></a>
<a id='line_445'>5:12 Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barak,</a>
<a id='line_446'>and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.</a>
<a id='line_447'></a>
<a id='line_448'>5:13 Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles</a>
<a id='line_449'>among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the mighty.</a>
<a id='line_450'></a>
<a id='line_451'>5:14 Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after</a>
<a id='line_452'>thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down governors,</a>
<a id='line_453'>and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the writer.</a>
<a id='line_454'></a>
<a id='line_455'>5:15 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar, and</a>
<a id='line_456'>also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the divisions of</a>
<a id='line_457'>Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.</a>
<a id='line_458'></a>
<a id='line_459'>5:16 Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings of</a>
<a id='line_460'>the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great searchings of</a>
<a id='line_461'>heart.</a>
<a id='line_462'></a>
<a id='line_463'>5:17 Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships?</a>
<a id='line_464'>Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.</a>
<a id='line_465'></a>
<a id='line_466'>5:18 Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives</a>
<a id='line_467'>unto the death in the high places of the field.</a>
<a id='line_468'></a>
<a id='line_469'>5:19 The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in</a>
<a id='line_470'>Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.</a>
<a id='line_471'></a>
<a id='line_472'>5:20 They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought</a>
<a id='line_473'>against Sisera.</a>
<a id='line_474'></a>
<a id='line_475'>5:21 The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the</a>
<a id='line_476'>river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.</a>
<a id='line_477'></a>
<a id='line_478'>5:22 Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings,</a>
<a id='line_479'>the pransings of their mighty ones.</a>
<a id='line_480'></a>
<a id='line_481'>5:23 Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly the</a>
<a id='line_482'>inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of the LORD, to</a>
<a id='line_483'>the help of the LORD against the mighty.</a>
<a id='line_484'></a>
<a id='line_485'>5:24 Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite be,</a>
<a id='line_486'>blessed shall she be above women in the tent.</a>
<a id='line_487'></a>
<a id='line_488'>5:25 He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth butter</a>
<a id='line_489'>in a lordly dish.</a>
<a id='line_490'></a>
<a id='line_491'>5:26 She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workmen’s</a>
<a id='line_492'>hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head,</a>
<a id='line_493'>when she had pierced and stricken through his temples.</a>
<a id='line_494'></a>
<a id='line_495'>5:27 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he bowed,</a>
<a id='line_496'>he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.</a>
<a id='line_497'></a>
<a id='line_498'>5:28 The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through</a>
<a id='line_499'>the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry the</a>
<a id='line_500'>wheels of his chariots?  5:29 Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she</a>
<a id='line_501'>returned answer to herself, 5:30 Have they not sped? have they not</a>
<a id='line_502'>divided the prey; to every man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of</a>
<a id='line_503'>divers colours, a prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers</a>
<a id='line_504'>colours of needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that</a>
<a id='line_505'>take the spoil?  5:31 So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let</a>
<a id='line_506'>them that love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And</a>
<a id='line_507'>the land had rest forty years.</a>
<a id='line_508'></a>
<a id='line_509'>6:1 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD: and</a>
<a id='line_510'>the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years.</a>
<a id='line_511'></a>
<a id='line_512'>6:2 And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because of</a>
<a id='line_513'>the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in</a>
<a id='line_514'>the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.</a>
<a id='line_515'></a>
<a id='line_516'>6:3 And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up,</a>
<a id='line_517'>and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up</a>
<a id='line_518'>against them; 6:4 And they encamped against them, and destroyed the</a>
<a id='line_519'>increase of the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no</a>
<a id='line_520'>sustenance for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.</a>
<a id='line_521'></a>
<a id='line_522'>6:5 For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came</a>
<a id='line_523'>as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were</a>
<a id='line_524'>without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.</a>
<a id='line_525'></a>
<a id='line_526'>6:6 And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites; and</a>
<a id='line_527'>the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_528'></a>
<a id='line_529'>6:7 And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto the</a>
<a id='line_530'>LORD because of the Midianites, 6:8 That the LORD sent a prophet unto</a>
<a id='line_531'>the children of Israel, which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God</a>
<a id='line_532'>of Israel, I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of</a>
<a id='line_533'>the house of bondage; 6:9 And I delivered you out of the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_534'>Egyptians, and out of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave</a>
<a id='line_535'>them out from before you, and gave you their land; 6:10 And I said</a>
<a id='line_536'>unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods of the Amorites,</a>
<a id='line_537'>in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not obeyed my voice.</a>
<a id='line_538'></a>
<a id='line_539'>6:11 And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak which</a>
<a id='line_540'>was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite: and his son</a>
<a id='line_541'>Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it from the</a>
<a id='line_542'>Midianites.</a>
<a id='line_543'></a>
<a id='line_544'>6:12 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him,</a>
<a id='line_545'>The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.</a>
<a id='line_546'></a>
<a id='line_547'>6:13 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why</a>
<a id='line_548'>then is all this befallen us? and where be all his miracles which our</a>
<a id='line_549'>fathers told us of, saying, Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?</a>
<a id='line_550'>but now the LORD hath forsaken us, and delivered us into the hands of</a>
<a id='line_551'>the Midianites.</a>
<a id='line_552'></a>
<a id='line_553'>6:14 And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might, and</a>
<a id='line_554'>thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: have not I</a>
<a id='line_555'>sent thee?  6:15 And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I</a>
<a id='line_556'>save Israel?  behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the</a>
<a id='line_557'>least in my father’s house.</a>
<a id='line_558'></a>
<a id='line_559'>6:16 And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and thou</a>
<a id='line_560'>shalt smite the Midianites as one man.</a>
<a id='line_561'></a>
<a id='line_562'>6:17 And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,</a>
<a id='line_563'>then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.</a>
<a id='line_564'></a>
<a id='line_565'>6:18 Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and bring</a>
<a id='line_566'>forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I will tarry</a>
<a id='line_567'>until thou come again.</a>
<a id='line_568'></a>
<a id='line_569'>6:19 And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes of</a>
<a id='line_570'>an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put the broth</a>
<a id='line_571'>in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak, and presented it.</a>
<a id='line_572'></a>
<a id='line_573'>6:20 And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the</a>
<a id='line_574'>unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out the broth.</a>
<a id='line_575'>And he did so.</a>
<a id='line_576'></a>
<a id='line_577'>6:21 Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that</a>
<a id='line_578'>was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and</a>
<a id='line_579'>there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh and the</a>
<a id='line_580'>unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD departed out of his</a>
<a id='line_581'>sight.</a>
<a id='line_582'></a>
<a id='line_583'>6:22 And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_584'>Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an angel of the</a>
<a id='line_585'>LORD face to face.</a>
<a id='line_586'></a>
<a id='line_587'>6:23 And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou</a>
<a id='line_588'>shalt not die.</a>
<a id='line_589'></a>
<a id='line_590'>6:24 Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it</a>
<a id='line_591'>Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</a>
<a id='line_592'></a>
<a id='line_593'>6:25 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him,</a>
<a id='line_594'>Take thy father’s young bullock, even the second bullock of seven</a>
<a id='line_595'>years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath, and</a>
<a id='line_596'>cut down the grove that is by it: 6:26 And build an altar unto the</a>
<a id='line_597'>LORD thy God upon the top of this rock, in the ordered place, and take</a>
<a id='line_598'>the second bullock, and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the</a>
<a id='line_599'>grove which thou shalt cut down.</a>
<a id='line_600'></a>
<a id='line_601'>6:27 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had</a>
<a id='line_602'>said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his father’s</a>
<a id='line_603'>household, and the men of the city, that he could not do it by day,</a>
<a id='line_604'>that he did it by night.</a>
<a id='line_605'></a>
<a id='line_606'>6:28 And when the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold,</a>
<a id='line_607'>the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut down that was</a>
<a id='line_608'>by it, and the second bullock was offered upon the altar that was</a>
<a id='line_609'>built.</a>
<a id='line_610'></a>
<a id='line_611'>6:29 And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And when</a>
<a id='line_612'>they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of Joash hath done</a>
<a id='line_613'>this thing.</a>
<a id='line_614'></a>
<a id='line_615'>6:30 Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son, that</a>
<a id='line_616'>he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal, and because</a>
<a id='line_617'>he hath cut down the grove that was by it.</a>
<a id='line_618'></a>
<a id='line_619'>6:31 And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead for</a>
<a id='line_620'>Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let him be put to</a>
<a id='line_621'>death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god, let him plead for</a>
<a id='line_622'>himself, because one hath cast down his altar.</a>
<a id='line_623'></a>
<a id='line_624'>6:32 Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal</a>
<a id='line_625'>plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.</a>
<a id='line_626'></a>
<a id='line_627'>6:33 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of</a>
<a id='line_628'>the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in the</a>
<a id='line_629'>valley of Jezreel.</a>
<a id='line_630'></a>
<a id='line_631'>6:34 But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a</a>
<a id='line_632'>trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.</a>
<a id='line_633'></a>
<a id='line_634'>6:35 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was</a>
<a id='line_635'>gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and unto</a>
<a id='line_636'>Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.</a>
<a id='line_637'></a>
<a id='line_638'>6:36 And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine hand,</a>
<a id='line_639'>as thou hast said, 6:37 Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the</a>
<a id='line_640'>floor; and if the dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all</a>
<a id='line_641'>the earth beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine</a>
<a id='line_642'>hand, as thou hast said.</a>
<a id='line_643'></a>
<a id='line_644'>6:38 And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust the</a>
<a id='line_645'>fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a bowl full of</a>
<a id='line_646'>water.</a>
<a id='line_647'></a>
<a id='line_648'>6:39 And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against me,</a>
<a id='line_649'>and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee, but this</a>
<a id='line_650'>once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the fleece, and upon</a>
<a id='line_651'>all the ground let there be dew.</a>
<a id='line_652'></a>
<a id='line_653'>6:40 And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece only,</a>
<a id='line_654'>and there was dew on all the ground.</a>
<a id='line_655'></a>
<a id='line_656'>7:1 Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were with</a>
<a id='line_657'>him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod: so that the</a>
<a id='line_658'>host of the Midianites were on the north side of them, by the hill of</a>
<a id='line_659'>Moreh, in the valley.</a>
<a id='line_660'></a>
<a id='line_661'>7:2 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee are</a>
<a id='line_662'>too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel</a>
<a id='line_663'>vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me.</a>
<a id='line_664'></a>
<a id='line_665'>7:3 Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people, saying,</a>
<a id='line_666'>Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and depart early from</a>
<a id='line_667'>mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty and two</a>
<a id='line_668'>thousand; and there remained ten thousand.</a>
<a id='line_669'></a>
<a id='line_670'>7:4 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring</a>
<a id='line_671'>them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee there: and it</a>
<a id='line_672'>shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This shall go with thee, the</a>
<a id='line_673'>same shall go with thee; and of whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall</a>
<a id='line_674'>not go with thee, the same shall not go.</a>
<a id='line_675'></a>
<a id='line_676'>7:5 So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD said</a>
<a id='line_677'>unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his tongue, as a</a>
<a id='line_678'>dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself; likewise every one that</a>
<a id='line_679'>boweth down upon his knees to drink.</a>
<a id='line_680'></a>
<a id='line_681'>7:6 And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to their</a>
<a id='line_682'>mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed</a>
<a id='line_683'>down upon their knees to drink water.</a>
<a id='line_684'></a>
<a id='line_685'>7:7 And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that</a>
<a id='line_686'>lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine hand:</a>
<a id='line_687'>and let all the other people go every man unto his place.</a>
<a id='line_688'></a>
<a id='line_689'>7:8 So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets: and</a>
<a id='line_690'>he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent, and retained</a>
<a id='line_691'>those three hundred men: and the host of Midian was beneath him in the</a>
<a id='line_692'>valley.</a>
<a id='line_693'></a>
<a id='line_694'>7:9 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto him,</a>
<a id='line_695'>Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered it into thine</a>
<a id='line_696'>hand.</a>
<a id='line_697'></a>
<a id='line_698'>7:10 But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant down</a>
<a id='line_699'>to the host: 7:11 And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward</a>
<a id='line_700'>shall thine hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went</a>
<a id='line_701'>he down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men that</a>
<a id='line_702'>were in the host.</a>
<a id='line_703'></a>
<a id='line_704'>7:12 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the</a>
<a id='line_705'>east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and</a>
<a id='line_706'>their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for</a>
<a id='line_707'>multitude.</a>
<a id='line_708'></a>
<a id='line_709'>7:13 And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a</a>
<a id='line_710'>dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, lo, a</a>
<a id='line_711'>cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came unto a</a>
<a id='line_712'>tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay</a>
<a id='line_713'>along.</a>
<a id='line_714'></a>
<a id='line_715'>7:14 And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save the</a>
<a id='line_716'>sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for into his hand</a>
<a id='line_717'>hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.</a>
<a id='line_718'></a>
<a id='line_719'>7:15 And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and</a>
<a id='line_720'>the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned into the</a>
<a id='line_721'>host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath delivered into your</a>
<a id='line_722'>hand the host of Midian.</a>
<a id='line_723'></a>
<a id='line_724'>7:16 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he</a>
<a id='line_725'>put a trumpet in every man’s hand, with empty pitchers, and lamps</a>
<a id='line_726'>within the pitchers.</a>
<a id='line_727'></a>
<a id='line_728'>7:17 And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold,</a>
<a id='line_729'>when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so</a>
<a id='line_730'>shall ye do.</a>
<a id='line_731'></a>
<a id='line_732'>7:18 When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then blow</a>
<a id='line_733'>ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, The sword</a>
<a id='line_734'>of the LORD, and of Gideon.</a>
<a id='line_735'></a>
<a id='line_736'>7:19 So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto the</a>
<a id='line_737'>outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch; and they had</a>
<a id='line_738'>but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and brake the</a>
<a id='line_739'>pitchers that were in their hands.</a>
<a id='line_740'></a>
<a id='line_741'>7:20 And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the</a>
<a id='line_742'>pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the trumpets in</a>
<a id='line_743'>their right hands to blow withal: and they cried, The sword of the</a>
<a id='line_744'>LORD, and of Gideon.</a>
<a id='line_745'></a>
<a id='line_746'>7:21 And they stood every man in his place round about the camp; and</a>
<a id='line_747'>all the host ran, and cried, and fled.</a>
<a id='line_748'></a>
<a id='line_749'>7:22 And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set every</a>
<a id='line_750'>man’s sword against his fellow, even throughout all the host: and the</a>
<a id='line_751'>host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the border of</a>
<a id='line_752'>Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.</a>
<a id='line_753'></a>
<a id='line_754'>7:23 And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of</a>
<a id='line_755'>Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after</a>
<a id='line_756'>the Midianites.</a>
<a id='line_757'></a>
<a id='line_758'>7:24 And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying,</a>
<a id='line_759'>come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters unto</a>
<a id='line_760'>Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of Ephraim gathered themselves</a>
<a id='line_761'>together, and took the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_762'></a>
<a id='line_763'>7:25 And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb; and</a>
<a id='line_764'>they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at the winepress</a>
<a id='line_765'>of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to</a>
<a id='line_766'>Gideon on the other side Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_767'></a>
<a id='line_768'>8:1 And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us</a>
<a id='line_769'>thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with the</a>
<a id='line_770'>Midianites?  And they did chide with him sharply.</a>
<a id='line_771'></a>
<a id='line_772'>8:2 And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of you?</a>
<a id='line_773'>Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage</a>
<a id='line_774'>of Abiezer?  8:3 God hath delivered into your hands the princes of</a>
<a id='line_775'>Midian, Oreb and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you?</a>
<a id='line_776'>Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.</a>
<a id='line_777'></a>
<a id='line_778'>8:4 And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three</a>
<a id='line_779'>hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.</a>
<a id='line_780'></a>
<a id='line_781'>8:5 And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves of</a>
<a id='line_782'>bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint, and I am</a>
<a id='line_783'>pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.</a>
<a id='line_784'></a>
<a id='line_785'>8:6 And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and</a>
<a id='line_786'>Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thine army?</a>
<a id='line_787'>8:7 And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah and</a>
<a id='line_788'>Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns</a>
<a id='line_789'>of the wilderness and with briers.</a>
<a id='line_790'></a>
<a id='line_791'>8:8 And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise: and</a>
<a id='line_792'>the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered him.</a>
<a id='line_793'></a>
<a id='line_794'>8:9 And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come</a>
<a id='line_795'>again in peace, I will break down this tower.</a>
<a id='line_796'></a>
<a id='line_797'>8:10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with them,</a>
<a id='line_798'>about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all the hosts of the</a>
<a id='line_799'>children of the east: for there fell an hundred and twenty thousand</a>
<a id='line_800'>men that drew sword.</a>
<a id='line_801'></a>
<a id='line_802'>8:11 And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on the</a>
<a id='line_803'>east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the host was</a>
<a id='line_804'>secure.</a>
<a id='line_805'></a>
<a id='line_806'>8:12 And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and took</a>
<a id='line_807'>the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and discomfited all the</a>
<a id='line_808'>host.</a>
<a id='line_809'></a>
<a id='line_810'>8:13 And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the sun</a>
<a id='line_811'>was up, 8:14 And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and</a>
<a id='line_812'>enquired of him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and</a>
<a id='line_813'>the elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.</a>
<a id='line_814'></a>
<a id='line_815'>8:15 And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah and</a>
<a id='line_816'>Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah</a>
<a id='line_817'>and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto thy men</a>
<a id='line_818'>that are weary?  8:16 And he took the elders of the city, and thorns</a>
<a id='line_819'>of the wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of</a>
<a id='line_820'>Succoth.</a>
<a id='line_821'></a>
<a id='line_822'>8:17 And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the</a>
<a id='line_823'>city.</a>
<a id='line_824'></a>
<a id='line_825'>8:18 Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were</a>
<a id='line_826'>they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so were</a>
<a id='line_827'>they; each one resembled the children of a king.</a>
<a id='line_828'></a>
<a id='line_829'>8:19 And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my mother:</a>
<a id='line_830'>as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you.</a>
<a id='line_831'></a>
<a id='line_832'>8:20 And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But the</a>
<a id='line_833'>youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was yet a youth.</a>
<a id='line_834'></a>
<a id='line_835'>8:21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for as</a>
<a id='line_836'>the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew Zebah and</a>
<a id='line_837'>Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on their camels’</a>
<a id='line_838'>necks.</a>
<a id='line_839'></a>
<a id='line_840'>8:22 Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us, both</a>
<a id='line_841'>thou, and thy son, and thy son’s son also: for thou hast delivered us</a>
<a id='line_842'>from the hand of Midian.</a>
<a id='line_843'></a>
<a id='line_844'>8:23 And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither</a>
<a id='line_845'>shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.</a>
<a id='line_846'></a>
<a id='line_847'>8:24 And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you, that</a>
<a id='line_848'>ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For they had</a>
<a id='line_849'>golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)  8:25 And they</a>
<a id='line_850'>answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a garment, and</a>
<a id='line_851'>did cast therein every man the earrings of his prey.</a>
<a id='line_852'></a>
<a id='line_853'>8:26 And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a</a>
<a id='line_854'>thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments, and</a>
<a id='line_855'>collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of Midian, and</a>
<a id='line_856'>beside the chains that were about their camels’ necks.</a>
<a id='line_857'></a>
<a id='line_858'>8:27 And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even in</a>
<a id='line_859'>Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it: which thing</a>
<a id='line_860'>became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.</a>
<a id='line_861'></a>
<a id='line_862'>8:28 Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that</a>
<a id='line_863'>they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in quietness</a>
<a id='line_864'>forty years in the days of Gideon.</a>
<a id='line_865'></a>
<a id='line_866'>8:29 And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own house.</a>
<a id='line_867'></a>
<a id='line_868'>8:30 And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten: for</a>
<a id='line_869'>he had many wives.</a>
<a id='line_870'></a>
<a id='line_871'>8:31 And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a son,</a>
<a id='line_872'>whose name he called Abimelech.</a>
<a id='line_873'></a>
<a id='line_874'>8:32 And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was</a>
<a id='line_875'>buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the</a>
<a id='line_876'>Abiezrites.</a>
<a id='line_877'></a>
<a id='line_878'>8:33 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the</a>
<a id='line_879'>children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after Baalim, and</a>
<a id='line_880'>made Baalberith their god.</a>
<a id='line_881'></a>
<a id='line_882'>8:34 And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God, who</a>
<a id='line_883'>had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every</a>
<a id='line_884'>side: 8:35 Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,</a>
<a id='line_885'>namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had shewed unto</a>
<a id='line_886'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_887'></a>
<a id='line_888'>9:1 And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his</a>
<a id='line_889'>mother’s brethren, and communed with them, and with all the family of</a>
<a id='line_890'>the house of his mother’s father, saying, 9:2 Speak, I pray you, in</a>
<a id='line_891'>the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, either</a>
<a id='line_892'>that all the sons of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons,</a>
<a id='line_893'>reign over you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am</a>
<a id='line_894'>your bone and your flesh.</a>
<a id='line_895'></a>
<a id='line_896'>9:3 And his mother’s brethren spake of him in the ears of all the men</a>
<a id='line_897'>of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to follow</a>
<a id='line_898'>Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.</a>
<a id='line_899'></a>
<a id='line_900'>9:4 And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of the</a>
<a id='line_901'>house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light persons,</a>
<a id='line_902'>which followed him.</a>
<a id='line_903'></a>
<a id='line_904'>9:5 And he went unto his father’s house at Ophrah, and slew his</a>
<a id='line_905'>brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten persons, upon</a>
<a id='line_906'>one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal</a>
<a id='line_907'>was left; for he hid himself.</a>
<a id='line_908'></a>
<a id='line_909'>9:6 And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the house of</a>
<a id='line_910'>Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the plain of the pillar</a>
<a id='line_911'>that was in Shechem.</a>
<a id='line_912'></a>
<a id='line_913'>9:7 And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top of</a>
<a id='line_914'>mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said unto them,</a>
<a id='line_915'>Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken unto you.</a>
<a id='line_916'></a>
<a id='line_917'>9:8 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and</a>
<a id='line_918'>they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.</a>
<a id='line_919'></a>
<a id='line_920'>9:9 But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,</a>
<a id='line_921'>wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted over</a>
<a id='line_922'>the trees?  9:10 And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and</a>
<a id='line_923'>reign over us.</a>
<a id='line_924'></a>
<a id='line_925'>9:11 But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my sweetness,</a>
<a id='line_926'>and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the trees?  9:12 Then</a>
<a id='line_927'>said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.</a>
<a id='line_928'></a>
<a id='line_929'>9:13 And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which</a>
<a id='line_930'>cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?  9:14 Then</a>
<a id='line_931'>said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.</a>
<a id='line_932'></a>
<a id='line_933'>9:15 And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me</a>
<a id='line_934'>king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and if not,</a>
<a id='line_935'>let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.</a>
<a id='line_936'></a>
<a id='line_937'>9:16 Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye</a>
<a id='line_938'>have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and</a>
<a id='line_939'>his house, and have done unto him according to the deserving of his</a>
<a id='line_940'>hands; 9:17 (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life</a>
<a id='line_941'>far, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian: 9:18 And ye are</a>
<a id='line_942'>risen up against my father’s house this day, and have slain his sons,</a>
<a id='line_943'>threescore and ten persons, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech,</a>
<a id='line_944'>the son of his maidservant, king over the men of Shechem, because he</a>
<a id='line_945'>is your brother;) 9:19 If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with</a>
<a id='line_946'>Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech,</a>
<a id='line_947'>and let him also rejoice in you: 9:20 But if not, let fire come out</a>
<a id='line_948'>from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo;</a>
<a id='line_949'>and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of</a>
<a id='line_950'>Millo, and devour Abimelech.</a>
<a id='line_951'></a>
<a id='line_952'>9:21 And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there,</a>
<a id='line_953'>for fear of Abimelech his brother.</a>
<a id='line_954'></a>
<a id='line_955'>9:22 When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel, 9:23 Then God</a>
<a id='line_956'>sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem; and the</a>
<a id='line_957'>men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech: 9:24 That the</a>
<a id='line_958'>cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come,</a>
<a id='line_959'>and their blood be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them;</a>
<a id='line_960'>and upon the men of Shechem, which aided him in the killing of his</a>
<a id='line_961'>brethren.</a>
<a id='line_962'></a>
<a id='line_963'>9:25 And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of</a>
<a id='line_964'>the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by them:</a>
<a id='line_965'>and it was told Abimelech.</a>
<a id='line_966'></a>
<a id='line_967'>9:26 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over to</a>
<a id='line_968'>Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him.</a>
<a id='line_969'></a>
<a id='line_970'>9:27 And they went out into the fields, and gathered their vineyards,</a>
<a id='line_971'>and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into the house of their</a>
<a id='line_972'>god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.</a>
<a id='line_973'></a>
<a id='line_974'>9:28 And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is</a>
<a id='line_975'>Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and</a>
<a id='line_976'>Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem: for</a>
<a id='line_977'>why should we serve him?  9:29 And would to God this people were under</a>
<a id='line_978'>my hand! then would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech,</a>
<a id='line_979'>Increase thine army, and come out.</a>
<a id='line_980'></a>
<a id='line_981'>9:30 And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the</a>
<a id='line_982'>son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.</a>
<a id='line_983'></a>
<a id='line_984'>9:31 And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold,</a>
<a id='line_985'>Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and, behold,</a>
<a id='line_986'>they fortify the city against thee.</a>
<a id='line_987'></a>
<a id='line_988'>9:32 Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with thee,</a>
<a id='line_989'>and lie in wait in the field: 9:33 And it shall be, that in the</a>
<a id='line_990'>morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon</a>
<a id='line_991'>the city: and, behold, when he and the people that is with him come</a>
<a id='line_992'>out against thee, then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find</a>
<a id='line_993'>occasion.</a>
<a id='line_994'></a>
<a id='line_995'>9:34 And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him, by</a>
<a id='line_996'>night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.</a>
<a id='line_997'></a>
<a id='line_998'>9:35 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering of</a>
<a id='line_999'>the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people that were</a>
<a id='line_1000'>with him, from lying in wait.</a>
<a id='line_1001'></a>
<a id='line_1002'>9:36 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there</a>
<a id='line_1003'>come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said unto</a>
<a id='line_1004'>him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.</a>
<a id='line_1005'></a>
<a id='line_1006'>9:37 And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by the</a>
<a id='line_1007'>middle of the land, and another company come along by the plain of</a>
<a id='line_1008'>Meonenim.</a>
<a id='line_1009'></a>
<a id='line_1010'>9:38 Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith thou</a>
<a id='line_1011'>saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this the</a>
<a id='line_1012'>people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray now, and fight with</a>
<a id='line_1013'>them.</a>
<a id='line_1014'></a>
<a id='line_1015'>9:39 And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with</a>
<a id='line_1016'>Abimelech.</a>
<a id='line_1017'></a>
<a id='line_1018'>9:40 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many were</a>
<a id='line_1019'>overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the gate.</a>
<a id='line_1020'></a>
<a id='line_1021'>9:41 And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and his</a>
<a id='line_1022'>brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.</a>
<a id='line_1023'></a>
<a id='line_1024'>9:42 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into</a>
<a id='line_1025'>the field; and they told Abimelech.</a>
<a id='line_1026'></a>
<a id='line_1027'>9:43 And he took the people, and divided them into three companies,</a>
<a id='line_1028'>and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the people were</a>
<a id='line_1029'>come forth out of the city; and he rose up against them, and smote</a>
<a id='line_1030'>them.</a>
<a id='line_1031'></a>
<a id='line_1032'>9:44 And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed forward,</a>
<a id='line_1033'>and stood in the entering of the gate of the city: and the two other</a>
<a id='line_1034'>companies ran upon all the people that were in the fields, and slew</a>
<a id='line_1035'>them.</a>
<a id='line_1036'></a>
<a id='line_1037'>9:45 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took</a>
<a id='line_1038'>the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat down the</a>
<a id='line_1039'>city, and sowed it with salt.</a>
<a id='line_1040'></a>
<a id='line_1041'>9:46 And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they</a>
<a id='line_1042'>entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.</a>
<a id='line_1043'></a>
<a id='line_1044'>9:47 And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of</a>
<a id='line_1045'>Shechem were gathered together.</a>
<a id='line_1046'></a>
<a id='line_1047'>9:48 And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people</a>
<a id='line_1048'>that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut</a>
<a id='line_1049'>down a bough from the trees, and took it, and laid it on his shoulder,</a>
<a id='line_1050'>and said unto the people that were with him, What ye have seen me do,</a>
<a id='line_1051'>make haste, and do as I have done.</a>
<a id='line_1052'></a>
<a id='line_1053'>9:49 And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and</a>
<a id='line_1054'>followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold on fire</a>
<a id='line_1055'>upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also,</a>
<a id='line_1056'>about a thousand men and women.</a>
<a id='line_1057'></a>
<a id='line_1058'>9:50 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and</a>
<a id='line_1059'>took it.</a>
<a id='line_1060'></a>
<a id='line_1061'>9:51 But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled</a>
<a id='line_1062'>all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it to them,</a>
<a id='line_1063'>and gat them up to the top of the tower.</a>
<a id='line_1064'></a>
<a id='line_1065'>9:52 And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and</a>
<a id='line_1066'>went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.</a>
<a id='line_1067'></a>
<a id='line_1068'>9:53 And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon Abimelech’s</a>
<a id='line_1069'>head, and all to brake his skull.</a>
<a id='line_1070'></a>
<a id='line_1071'>9:54 Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer, and</a>
<a id='line_1072'>said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say not of me, A</a>
<a id='line_1073'>women slew him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.</a>
<a id='line_1074'></a>
<a id='line_1075'>9:55 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they</a>
<a id='line_1076'>departed every man unto his place.</a>
<a id='line_1077'></a>
<a id='line_1078'>9:56 Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did unto</a>
<a id='line_1079'>his father, in slaying his seventy brethren: 9:57 And all the evil of</a>
<a id='line_1080'>the men of Shechem did God render upon their heads: and upon them came</a>
<a id='line_1081'>the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal.</a>
<a id='line_1082'></a>
<a id='line_1083'>10:1 And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son of</a>
<a id='line_1084'>Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in Shamir in</a>
<a id='line_1085'>mount Ephraim.</a>
<a id='line_1086'></a>
<a id='line_1087'>10:2 And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was</a>
<a id='line_1088'>buried in Shamir.</a>
<a id='line_1089'></a>
<a id='line_1090'>10:3 And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel twenty</a>
<a id='line_1091'>and two years.</a>
<a id='line_1092'></a>
<a id='line_1093'>10:4 And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they</a>
<a id='line_1094'>had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day, which</a>
<a id='line_1095'>are in the land of Gilead.</a>
<a id='line_1096'></a>
<a id='line_1097'>10:5 And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.</a>
<a id='line_1098'></a>
<a id='line_1099'>10:6 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the</a>
<a id='line_1100'>LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the</a>
<a id='line_1101'>gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of</a>
<a id='line_1102'>Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and</a>
<a id='line_1103'>served not him.</a>
<a id='line_1104'></a>
<a id='line_1105'>10:7 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold</a>
<a id='line_1106'>them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the</a>
<a id='line_1107'>children of Ammon.</a>
<a id='line_1108'></a>
<a id='line_1109'>10:8 And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel:</a>
<a id='line_1110'>eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the other side</a>
<a id='line_1111'>Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.</a>
<a id='line_1112'></a>
<a id='line_1113'>10:9 Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight also</a>
<a id='line_1114'>against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim;</a>
<a id='line_1115'>so that Israel was sore distressed.</a>
<a id='line_1116'></a>
<a id='line_1117'>10:10 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We have</a>
<a id='line_1118'>sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also</a>
<a id='line_1119'>served Baalim.</a>
<a id='line_1120'></a>
<a id='line_1121'>10:11 And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I deliver</a>
<a id='line_1122'>you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of</a>
<a id='line_1123'>Ammon, and from the Philistines?  10:12 The Zidonians also, and the</a>
<a id='line_1124'>Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and ye cried to me, and</a>
<a id='line_1125'>I delivered you out of their hand.</a>
<a id='line_1126'></a>
<a id='line_1127'>10:13 Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I will</a>
<a id='line_1128'>deliver you no more.</a>
<a id='line_1129'></a>
<a id='line_1130'>10:14 Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them deliver</a>
<a id='line_1131'>you in the time of your tribulation.</a>
<a id='line_1132'></a>
<a id='line_1133'>10:15 And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned:</a>
<a id='line_1134'>do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us only, we</a>
<a id='line_1135'>pray thee, this day.</a>
<a id='line_1136'></a>
<a id='line_1137'>10:16 And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served</a>
<a id='line_1138'>the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1139'></a>
<a id='line_1140'>10:17 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped</a>
<a id='line_1141'>in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled themselves together,</a>
<a id='line_1142'>and encamped in Mizpeh.</a>
<a id='line_1143'></a>
<a id='line_1144'>10:18 And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What</a>
<a id='line_1145'>man is he that will begin to fight against the children of Ammon? he</a>
<a id='line_1146'>shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.</a>
<a id='line_1147'></a>
<a id='line_1148'>11:1 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he was</a>
<a id='line_1149'>the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.</a>
<a id='line_1150'></a>
<a id='line_1151'>11:2 And Gilead’s wife bare him sons; and his wife’s sons grew up, and</a>
<a id='line_1152'>they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt not inherit in</a>
<a id='line_1153'>our father’s house; for thou art the son of a strange woman.</a>
<a id='line_1154'></a>
<a id='line_1155'>11:3 Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of</a>
<a id='line_1156'>Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went out with</a>
<a id='line_1157'>him.</a>
<a id='line_1158'></a>
<a id='line_1159'>11:4 And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of</a>
<a id='line_1160'>Ammon made war against Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1161'></a>
<a id='line_1162'>11:5 And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against</a>
<a id='line_1163'>Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah out of the land of</a>
<a id='line_1164'>Tob: 11:6 And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that</a>
<a id='line_1165'>we may fight with the children of Ammon.</a>
<a id='line_1166'></a>
<a id='line_1167'>11:7 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate me,</a>
<a id='line_1168'>and expel me out of my father’s house? and why are ye come unto me now</a>
<a id='line_1169'>when ye are in distress?  11:8 And the elders of Gilead said unto</a>
<a id='line_1170'>Jephthah, Therefore we turn again to thee now, that thou mayest go</a>
<a id='line_1171'>with us, and fight against the children of Ammon, and be our head over</a>
<a id='line_1172'>all the inhabitants of Gilead.</a>
<a id='line_1173'></a>
<a id='line_1174'>11:9 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me home</a>
<a id='line_1175'>again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the LORD deliver</a>
<a id='line_1176'>them before me, shall I be your head?  11:10 And the elders of Gilead</a>
<a id='line_1177'>said unto Jephthah, The LORD be witness between us, if we do not so</a>
<a id='line_1178'>according to thy words.</a>
<a id='line_1179'></a>
<a id='line_1180'>11:11 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people</a>
<a id='line_1181'>made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all his</a>
<a id='line_1182'>words before the LORD in Mizpeh.</a>
<a id='line_1183'></a>
<a id='line_1184'>11:12 And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of</a>
<a id='line_1185'>Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art come</a>
<a id='line_1186'>against me to fight in my land?  11:13 And the king of the children of</a>
<a id='line_1187'>Ammon answered unto the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took</a>
<a id='line_1188'>away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto</a>
<a id='line_1189'>Jabbok, and unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again</a>
<a id='line_1190'>peaceably.</a>
<a id='line_1191'></a>
<a id='line_1192'>11:14 And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the children</a>
<a id='line_1193'>of Ammon: 11:15 And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took</a>
<a id='line_1194'>not away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:</a>
<a id='line_1195'>11:16 But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the</a>
<a id='line_1196'>wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh; 11:17 Then Israel</a>
<a id='line_1197'>sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee,</a>
<a id='line_1198'>pass through thy land: but the king of Edom would not hearken thereto.</a>
<a id='line_1199'>And in like manner they sent unto the king of Moab: but he would not</a>
<a id='line_1200'>consent: and Israel abode in Kadesh.</a>
<a id='line_1201'></a>
<a id='line_1202'>11:18 Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the</a>
<a id='line_1203'>land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the</a>
<a id='line_1204'>land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, but came not</a>
<a id='line_1205'>within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the border of Moab.</a>
<a id='line_1206'></a>
<a id='line_1207'>11:19 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, the</a>
<a id='line_1208'>king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we pray thee,</a>
<a id='line_1209'>through thy land into my place.</a>
<a id='line_1210'></a>
<a id='line_1211'>11:20 But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but</a>
<a id='line_1212'>Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz, and</a>
<a id='line_1213'>fought against Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1214'></a>
<a id='line_1215'>11:21 And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people</a>
<a id='line_1216'>into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel possessed all</a>
<a id='line_1217'>the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.</a>
<a id='line_1218'></a>
<a id='line_1219'>11:22 And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon</a>
<a id='line_1220'>even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_1221'></a>
<a id='line_1222'>11:23 So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites</a>
<a id='line_1223'>from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?  11:24</a>
<a id='line_1224'>Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee to</a>
<a id='line_1225'>possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out from before</a>
<a id='line_1226'>us, them will we possess.</a>
<a id='line_1227'></a>
<a id='line_1228'>11:25 And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of Zippor,</a>
<a id='line_1229'>king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight</a>
<a id='line_1230'>against them, 11:26 While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and</a>
<a id='line_1231'>in Aroer and her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the</a>
<a id='line_1232'>coasts of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not recover</a>
<a id='line_1233'>them within that time?  11:27 Wherefore I have not sinned against</a>
<a id='line_1234'>thee, but thou doest me wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be</a>
<a id='line_1235'>judge this day between the children of Israel and the children of</a>
<a id='line_1236'>Ammon.</a>
<a id='line_1237'></a>
<a id='line_1238'>11:28 Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto the</a>
<a id='line_1239'>words of Jephthah which he sent him.</a>
<a id='line_1240'></a>
<a id='line_1241'>11:29 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed</a>
<a id='line_1242'>over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from</a>
<a id='line_1243'>Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of Ammon.</a>
<a id='line_1244'></a>
<a id='line_1245'>11:30 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_1246'>without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine hands, 11:31 Then</a>
<a id='line_1247'>it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to</a>
<a id='line_1248'>meet me, when I return in peace from the children of Ammon, shall</a>
<a id='line_1249'>surely be the LORD’s, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering.</a>
<a id='line_1250'></a>
<a id='line_1251'>11:32 So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight</a>
<a id='line_1252'>against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.</a>
<a id='line_1253'></a>
<a id='line_1254'>11:33 And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith,</a>
<a id='line_1255'>even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with a very</a>
<a id='line_1256'>great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were subdued before the</a>
<a id='line_1257'>children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1258'></a>
<a id='line_1259'>11:34 And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his</a>
<a id='line_1260'>daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances: and she</a>
<a id='line_1261'>was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor daughter.</a>
<a id='line_1262'></a>
<a id='line_1263'>11:35 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his clothes,</a>
<a id='line_1264'>and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me very low, and thou</a>
<a id='line_1265'>art one of them that trouble me: for I have opened my mouth unto the</a>
<a id='line_1266'>LORD, and I cannot go back.</a>
<a id='line_1267'></a>
<a id='line_1268'>11:36 And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy mouth</a>
<a id='line_1269'>unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath proceeded out of</a>
<a id='line_1270'>thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken vengeance for thee of</a>
<a id='line_1271'>thine enemies, even of the children of Ammon.</a>
<a id='line_1272'></a>
<a id='line_1273'>11:37 And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me: let</a>
<a id='line_1274'>me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the mountains, and</a>
<a id='line_1275'>bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.</a>
<a id='line_1276'></a>
<a id='line_1277'>11:38 And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she</a>
<a id='line_1278'>went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the</a>
<a id='line_1279'>mountains.</a>
<a id='line_1280'></a>
<a id='line_1281'>11:39 And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned</a>
<a id='line_1282'>unto her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had</a>
<a id='line_1283'>vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel, 11:40 That</a>
<a id='line_1284'>the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah</a>
<a id='line_1285'>the Gileadite four days in a year.</a>
<a id='line_1286'></a>
<a id='line_1287'>12:1 And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went</a>
<a id='line_1288'>northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou over to</a>
<a id='line_1289'>fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with</a>
<a id='line_1290'>thee? we will burn thine house upon thee with fire.</a>
<a id='line_1291'></a>
<a id='line_1292'>12:2 And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great strife</a>
<a id='line_1293'>with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye delivered me not</a>
<a id='line_1294'>out of their hands.</a>
<a id='line_1295'></a>
<a id='line_1296'>12:3 And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my</a>
<a id='line_1297'>hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the LORD</a>
<a id='line_1298'>delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come up unto me</a>
<a id='line_1299'>this day, to fight against me?  12:4 Then Jephthah gathered together</a>
<a id='line_1300'>all the men of Gilead, and fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead</a>
<a id='line_1301'>smote Ephraim, because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of</a>
<a id='line_1302'>Ephraim among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.</a>
<a id='line_1303'></a>
<a id='line_1304'>12:5 And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the</a>
<a id='line_1305'>Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which were</a>
<a id='line_1306'>escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said unto him,</a>
<a id='line_1307'>Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay; 12:6 Then said they unto him,</a>
<a id='line_1308'>Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to</a>
<a id='line_1309'>pronounce it right. Then they took him, and slew him at the passages</a>
<a id='line_1310'>of Jordan: and there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and</a>
<a id='line_1311'>two thousand.</a>
<a id='line_1312'></a>
<a id='line_1313'>12:7 And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the</a>
<a id='line_1314'>Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.</a>
<a id='line_1315'></a>
<a id='line_1316'>12:8 And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1317'></a>
<a id='line_1318'>12:9 And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent</a>
<a id='line_1319'>abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons. And he</a>
<a id='line_1320'>judged Israel seven years.</a>
<a id='line_1321'></a>
<a id='line_1322'>12:10 Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.</a>
<a id='line_1323'></a>
<a id='line_1324'>12:11 And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged</a>
<a id='line_1325'>Israel ten years.</a>
<a id='line_1326'></a>
<a id='line_1327'>12:12 And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the</a>
<a id='line_1328'>country of Zebulun.</a>
<a id='line_1329'></a>
<a id='line_1330'>12:13 And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged</a>
<a id='line_1331'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1332'></a>
<a id='line_1333'>12:14 And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on</a>
<a id='line_1334'>threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.</a>
<a id='line_1335'></a>
<a id='line_1336'>12:15 And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried</a>
<a id='line_1337'>in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the Amalekites.</a>
<a id='line_1338'></a>
<a id='line_1339'>13:1 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the</a>
<a id='line_1340'>LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines</a>
<a id='line_1341'>forty years.</a>
<a id='line_1342'></a>
<a id='line_1343'>13:2 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the</a>
<a id='line_1344'>Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and bare not.</a>
<a id='line_1345'></a>
<a id='line_1346'>13:3 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_1347'>her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_1348'>conceive, and bear a son.</a>
<a id='line_1349'></a>
<a id='line_1350'>13:4 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor strong</a>
<a id='line_1351'>drink, and eat not any unclean thing: 13:5 For, lo, thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_1352'>conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the</a>
<a id='line_1353'>child shall be a Nazarite unto God from the womb: and he shall begin</a>
<a id='line_1354'>to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_1355'></a>
<a id='line_1356'>13:6 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God</a>
<a id='line_1357'>came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of an angel</a>
<a id='line_1358'>of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he was, neither told</a>
<a id='line_1359'>he me his name: 13:7 But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive,</a>
<a id='line_1360'>and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat</a>
<a id='line_1361'>any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the</a>
<a id='line_1362'>womb to the day of his death.</a>
<a id='line_1363'></a>
<a id='line_1364'>13:8 Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the man</a>
<a id='line_1365'>of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach us what we</a>
<a id='line_1366'>shall do unto the child that shall be born.</a>
<a id='line_1367'></a>
<a id='line_1368'>13:9 And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God</a>
<a id='line_1369'>came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah her</a>
<a id='line_1370'>husband was not with her.</a>
<a id='line_1371'></a>
<a id='line_1372'>13:10 And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and</a>
<a id='line_1373'>said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that came unto</a>
<a id='line_1374'>me the other day.</a>
<a id='line_1375'></a>
<a id='line_1376'>13:11 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man,</a>
<a id='line_1377'>and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the woman? And</a>
<a id='line_1378'>he said, I am.</a>
<a id='line_1379'></a>
<a id='line_1380'>13:12 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we</a>
<a id='line_1381'>order the child, and how shall we do unto him?  13:13 And the angel of</a>
<a id='line_1382'>the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said unto the woman let her</a>
<a id='line_1383'>beware.</a>
<a id='line_1384'></a>
<a id='line_1385'>13:14 She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither</a>
<a id='line_1386'>let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all</a>
<a id='line_1387'>that I commanded her let her observe.</a>
<a id='line_1388'></a>
<a id='line_1389'>13:15 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let us</a>
<a id='line_1390'>detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.</a>
<a id='line_1391'></a>
<a id='line_1392'>13:16 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain</a>
<a id='line_1393'>me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a burnt</a>
<a id='line_1394'>offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah knew not that</a>
<a id='line_1395'>he was an angel of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1396'></a>
<a id='line_1397'>13:17 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name,</a>
<a id='line_1398'>that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?  13:18 And</a>
<a id='line_1399'>the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus after my</a>
<a id='line_1400'>name, seeing it is secret?  13:19 So Manoah took a kid with a meat</a>
<a id='line_1401'>offering, and offered it upon a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did</a>
<a id='line_1402'>wonderously; and Manoah and his wife looked on.</a>
<a id='line_1403'></a>
<a id='line_1404'>13:20 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from</a>
<a id='line_1405'>off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the flame of the</a>
<a id='line_1406'>altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and fell on their faces</a>
<a id='line_1407'>to the ground.</a>
<a id='line_1408'></a>
<a id='line_1409'>13:21 But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to</a>
<a id='line_1410'>his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_1411'></a>
<a id='line_1412'>13:22 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we</a>
<a id='line_1413'>have seen God.</a>
<a id='line_1414'></a>
<a id='line_1415'>13:23 But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us,</a>
<a id='line_1416'>he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our</a>
<a id='line_1417'>hands, neither would he have shewed us all these things, nor would as</a>
<a id='line_1418'>at this time have told us such things as these.</a>
<a id='line_1419'></a>
<a id='line_1420'>13:24 And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the</a>
<a id='line_1421'>child grew, and the LORD blessed him.</a>
<a id='line_1422'></a>
<a id='line_1423'>13:25 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the</a>
<a id='line_1424'>camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.</a>
<a id='line_1425'></a>
<a id='line_1426'>14:1 And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of</a>
<a id='line_1427'>the daughters of the Philistines.</a>
<a id='line_1428'></a>
<a id='line_1429'>14:2 And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said, I</a>
<a id='line_1430'>have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines: now</a>
<a id='line_1431'>therefore get her for me to wife.</a>
<a id='line_1432'></a>
<a id='line_1433'>14:3 Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a</a>
<a id='line_1434'>woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my people,</a>
<a id='line_1435'>that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And</a>
<a id='line_1436'>Samson said unto his father, Get her for me; for she pleaseth me well.</a>
<a id='line_1437'></a>
<a id='line_1438'>14:4 But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the LORD,</a>
<a id='line_1439'>that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for at that time</a>
<a id='line_1440'>the Philistines had dominion over Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1441'></a>
<a id='line_1442'>14:5 Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to Timnath,</a>
<a id='line_1443'>and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a young lion roared</a>
<a id='line_1444'>against him.</a>
<a id='line_1445'></a>
<a id='line_1446'>14:6 And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent</a>
<a id='line_1447'>him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his hand: but</a>
<a id='line_1448'>he told not his father or his mother what he had done.</a>
<a id='line_1449'></a>
<a id='line_1450'>14:7 And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased</a>
<a id='line_1451'>Samson well.</a>
<a id='line_1452'></a>
<a id='line_1453'>14:8 And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to</a>
<a id='line_1454'>see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm of bees</a>
<a id='line_1455'>and honey in the carcase of the lion.</a>
<a id='line_1456'></a>
<a id='line_1457'>14:9 And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came to</a>
<a id='line_1458'>his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat: but he told</a>
<a id='line_1459'>not them that he had taken the honey out of the carcase of the lion.</a>
<a id='line_1460'></a>
<a id='line_1461'>14:10 So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there a</a>
<a id='line_1462'>feast; for so used the young men to do.</a>
<a id='line_1463'></a>
<a id='line_1464'>14:11 And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought thirty</a>
<a id='line_1465'>companions to be with him.</a>
<a id='line_1466'></a>
<a id='line_1467'>14:12 And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto</a>
<a id='line_1468'>you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days of the</a>
<a id='line_1469'>feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty sheets and thirty</a>
<a id='line_1470'>change of garments: 14:13 But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall</a>
<a id='line_1471'>ye give me thirty sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said</a>
<a id='line_1472'>unto him, Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.</a>
<a id='line_1473'></a>
<a id='line_1474'>14:14 And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and out</a>
<a id='line_1475'>of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in three days</a>
<a id='line_1476'>expound the riddle.</a>
<a id='line_1477'></a>
<a id='line_1478'>14:15 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto</a>
<a id='line_1479'>Samson’s wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us the</a>
<a id='line_1480'>riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father’s house with fire: have ye</a>
<a id='line_1481'>called us to take that we have? is it not so?  14:16 And Samson’s wife</a>
<a id='line_1482'>wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not:</a>
<a id='line_1483'>thou hast put forth a riddle unto the children of my people, and hast</a>
<a id='line_1484'>not told it me. And he said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my</a>
<a id='line_1485'>father nor my mother, and shall I tell it thee?  14:17 And she wept</a>
<a id='line_1486'>before him the seven days, while their feast lasted: and it came to</a>
<a id='line_1487'>pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she lay sore upon</a>
<a id='line_1488'>him: and she told the riddle to the children of her people.</a>
<a id='line_1489'></a>
<a id='line_1490'>14:18 And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day before</a>
<a id='line_1491'>the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what is stronger</a>
<a id='line_1492'>than a lion?  and he said unto them, If ye had not plowed with my</a>
<a id='line_1493'>heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.</a>
<a id='line_1494'></a>
<a id='line_1495'>14:19 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to</a>
<a id='line_1496'>Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil, and gave</a>
<a id='line_1497'>change of garments unto them which expounded the riddle. And his anger</a>
<a id='line_1498'>was kindled, and he went up to his father’s house.</a>
<a id='line_1499'></a>
<a id='line_1500'>14:20 But Samson’s wife was given to his companion, whom he had used</a>
<a id='line_1501'>as his friend.</a>
<a id='line_1502'></a>
<a id='line_1503'>15:1 But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat</a>
<a id='line_1504'>harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said, I will</a>
<a id='line_1505'>go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would not suffer him</a>
<a id='line_1506'>to go in.</a>
<a id='line_1507'></a>
<a id='line_1508'>15:2 And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly</a>
<a id='line_1509'>hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her younger</a>
<a id='line_1510'>sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead of her.</a>
<a id='line_1511'></a>
<a id='line_1512'>15:3 And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless</a>
<a id='line_1513'>than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.</a>
<a id='line_1514'></a>
<a id='line_1515'>15:4 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took</a>
<a id='line_1516'>firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst</a>
<a id='line_1517'>between two tails.</a>
<a id='line_1518'></a>
<a id='line_1519'>15:5 And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into the</a>
<a id='line_1520'>standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the shocks, and</a>
<a id='line_1521'>also the standing corn, with the vineyards and olives.</a>
<a id='line_1522'></a>
<a id='line_1523'>15:6 Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they answered,</a>
<a id='line_1524'>Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he had taken his wife,</a>
<a id='line_1525'>and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up, and burnt</a>
<a id='line_1526'>her and her father with fire.</a>
<a id='line_1527'></a>
<a id='line_1528'>15:7 And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will I</a>
<a id='line_1529'>be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.</a>
<a id='line_1530'></a>
<a id='line_1531'>15:8 And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he</a>
<a id='line_1532'>went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.</a>
<a id='line_1533'></a>
<a id='line_1534'>15:9 Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread</a>
<a id='line_1535'>themselves in Lehi.</a>
<a id='line_1536'></a>
<a id='line_1537'>15:10 And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And</a>
<a id='line_1538'>they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as he hath</a>
<a id='line_1539'>done to us.</a>
<a id='line_1540'></a>
<a id='line_1541'>15:11 Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock</a>
<a id='line_1542'>Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines are</a>
<a id='line_1543'>rulers over us? what is this that thou hast done unto us? And he said</a>
<a id='line_1544'>unto them, As they did unto me, so have I done unto them.</a>
<a id='line_1545'></a>
<a id='line_1546'>15:12 And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we</a>
<a id='line_1547'>may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson said</a>
<a id='line_1548'>unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.</a>
<a id='line_1549'></a>
<a id='line_1550'>15:13 And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee fast,</a>
<a id='line_1551'>and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not kill thee.</a>
<a id='line_1552'>And they bound him with two new cords, and brought him up from the</a>
<a id='line_1553'>rock.</a>
<a id='line_1554'></a>
<a id='line_1555'>15:14 And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against him:</a>
<a id='line_1556'>and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the cords that</a>
<a id='line_1557'>were upon his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire, and his</a>
<a id='line_1558'>bands loosed from off his hands.</a>
<a id='line_1559'></a>
<a id='line_1560'>15:15 And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand,</a>
<a id='line_1561'>and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.</a>
<a id='line_1562'></a>
<a id='line_1563'>15:16 And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,</a>
<a id='line_1564'>with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.</a>
<a id='line_1565'></a>
<a id='line_1566'>15:17 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that</a>
<a id='line_1567'>he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that place</a>
<a id='line_1568'>Ramathlehi.</a>
<a id='line_1569'></a>
<a id='line_1570'>15:18 And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said, Thou</a>
<a id='line_1571'>hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy servant: and</a>
<a id='line_1572'>now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the</a>
<a id='line_1573'>uncircumcised?  15:19 But God clave an hollow place that was in the</a>
<a id='line_1574'>jaw, and there came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit</a>
<a id='line_1575'>came again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof</a>
<a id='line_1576'>Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.</a>
<a id='line_1577'></a>
<a id='line_1578'>15:20 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty</a>
<a id='line_1579'>years.</a>
<a id='line_1580'></a>
<a id='line_1581'>16:1 Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in</a>
<a id='line_1582'>unto her.</a>
<a id='line_1583'></a>
<a id='line_1584'>16:2 And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither. And</a>
<a id='line_1585'>they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate of</a>
<a id='line_1586'>the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In the morning, when</a>
<a id='line_1587'>it is day, we shall kill him.</a>
<a id='line_1588'></a>
<a id='line_1589'>16:3 And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the</a>
<a id='line_1590'>doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with</a>
<a id='line_1591'>them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders, and carried them</a>
<a id='line_1592'>up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.</a>
<a id='line_1593'></a>
<a id='line_1594'>16:4 And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the</a>
<a id='line_1595'>valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.</a>
<a id='line_1596'></a>
<a id='line_1597'>16:5 And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said unto</a>
<a id='line_1598'>her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lieth, and by what</a>
<a id='line_1599'>means we may prevail against him, that we may bind him to afflict him;</a>
<a id='line_1600'>and we will give thee every one of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.</a>
<a id='line_1601'></a>
<a id='line_1602'>16:6 And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy</a>
<a id='line_1603'>great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to afflict</a>
<a id='line_1604'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_1605'></a>
<a id='line_1606'>16:7 And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green withs</a>
<a id='line_1607'>that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.</a>
<a id='line_1608'></a>
<a id='line_1609'>16:8 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green</a>
<a id='line_1610'>withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.</a>
<a id='line_1611'></a>
<a id='line_1612'>16:9 Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the</a>
<a id='line_1613'>chamber.</a>
<a id='line_1614'></a>
<a id='line_1615'>And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he</a>
<a id='line_1616'>brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken when it toucheth the</a>
<a id='line_1617'>fire. So his strength was not known.</a>
<a id='line_1618'></a>
<a id='line_1619'>16:10 And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and</a>
<a id='line_1620'>told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou mightest be</a>
<a id='line_1621'>bound.</a>
<a id='line_1622'></a>
<a id='line_1623'>16:11 And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that</a>
<a id='line_1624'>never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another man.</a>
<a id='line_1625'></a>
<a id='line_1626'>16:12 Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and</a>
<a id='line_1627'>said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there were</a>
<a id='line_1628'>liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them from off his</a>
<a id='line_1629'>arms like a thread.</a>
<a id='line_1630'></a>
<a id='line_1631'>16:13 And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me, and</a>
<a id='line_1632'>told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound. And he said</a>
<a id='line_1633'>unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my head with the web.</a>
<a id='line_1634'></a>
<a id='line_1635'>16:14 And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The</a>
<a id='line_1636'>Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his sleep, and</a>
<a id='line_1637'>went away with the pin of the beam, and with the web.</a>
<a id='line_1638'></a>
<a id='line_1639'>16:15 And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when</a>
<a id='line_1640'>thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three times, and</a>
<a id='line_1641'>hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.</a>
<a id='line_1642'></a>
<a id='line_1643'>16:16 And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her words,</a>
<a id='line_1644'>and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death; 16:17 That he</a>
<a id='line_1645'>told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath not come a razor</a>
<a id='line_1646'>upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite unto God from my mother’s</a>
<a id='line_1647'>womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall</a>
<a id='line_1648'>become weak, and be like any other man.</a>
<a id='line_1649'></a>
<a id='line_1650'>16:18 And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she</a>
<a id='line_1651'>sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up this</a>
<a id='line_1652'>once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the lords of the</a>
<a id='line_1653'>Philistines came up unto her, and brought money in their hand.</a>
<a id='line_1654'></a>
<a id='line_1655'>16:19 And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a man,</a>
<a id='line_1656'>and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his head; and she</a>
<a id='line_1657'>began to afflict him, and his strength went from him.</a>
<a id='line_1658'></a>
<a id='line_1659'>16:20 And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awoke</a>
<a id='line_1660'>out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times before,</a>
<a id='line_1661'>and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD was departed from him.</a>
<a id='line_1662'></a>
<a id='line_1663'>16:21 But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and brought</a>
<a id='line_1664'>him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass; and he did</a>
<a id='line_1665'>grind in the prison house.</a>
<a id='line_1666'></a>
<a id='line_1667'>16:22 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was</a>
<a id='line_1668'>shaven.</a>
<a id='line_1669'></a>
<a id='line_1670'>16:23 Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for to</a>
<a id='line_1671'>offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to rejoice: for they</a>
<a id='line_1672'>said, Our god hath delivered Samson our enemy into our hand.</a>
<a id='line_1673'></a>
<a id='line_1674'>16:24 And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they</a>
<a id='line_1675'>said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the</a>
<a id='line_1676'>destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.</a>
<a id='line_1677'></a>
<a id='line_1678'>16:25 And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they</a>
<a id='line_1679'>said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for</a>
<a id='line_1680'>Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set</a>
<a id='line_1681'>him between the pillars.</a>
<a id='line_1682'></a>
<a id='line_1683'>16:26 And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer</a>
<a id='line_1684'>me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth, that I</a>
<a id='line_1685'>may lean upon them.</a>
<a id='line_1686'></a>
<a id='line_1687'>16:27 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of</a>
<a id='line_1688'>the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about three</a>
<a id='line_1689'>thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made sport.</a>
<a id='line_1690'></a>
<a id='line_1691'>16:28 And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God, remember</a>
<a id='line_1692'>me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O</a>
<a id='line_1693'>God, that I may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.</a>
<a id='line_1694'></a>
<a id='line_1695'>16:29 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the</a>
<a id='line_1696'>house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his right</a>
<a id='line_1697'>hand, and of the other with his left.</a>
<a id='line_1698'></a>
<a id='line_1699'>16:30 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed</a>
<a id='line_1700'>himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords, and</a>
<a id='line_1701'>upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which he slew at</a>
<a id='line_1702'>his death were more than they which he slew in his life.</a>
<a id='line_1703'></a>
<a id='line_1704'>16:31 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down, and</a>
<a id='line_1705'>took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol</a>
<a id='line_1706'>in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he judged Israel twenty</a>
<a id='line_1707'>years.</a>
<a id='line_1708'></a>
<a id='line_1709'>17:1 And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.</a>
<a id='line_1710'></a>
<a id='line_1711'>17:2 And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of silver</a>
<a id='line_1712'>that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst, and spakest of</a>
<a id='line_1713'>also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his</a>
<a id='line_1714'>mother said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my son.</a>
<a id='line_1715'></a>
<a id='line_1716'>17:3 And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver to</a>
<a id='line_1717'>his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the silver unto</a>
<a id='line_1718'>the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven image and a molten</a>
<a id='line_1719'>image: now therefore I will restore it unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_1720'></a>
<a id='line_1721'>17:4 Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took</a>
<a id='line_1722'>two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder, who made</a>
<a id='line_1723'>thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they were in the house</a>
<a id='line_1724'>of Micah.</a>
<a id='line_1725'></a>
<a id='line_1726'>17:5 And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and</a>
<a id='line_1727'>teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.</a>
<a id='line_1728'></a>
<a id='line_1729'>17:6 In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that</a>
<a id='line_1730'>which was right in his own eyes.</a>
<a id='line_1731'></a>
<a id='line_1732'>17:7 And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family of</a>
<a id='line_1733'>Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.</a>
<a id='line_1734'></a>
<a id='line_1735'>17:8 And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to</a>
<a id='line_1736'>sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount Ephraim to</a>
<a id='line_1737'>the house of Micah, as he journeyed.</a>
<a id='line_1738'></a>
<a id='line_1739'>17:9 And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto</a>
<a id='line_1740'>him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn where I may</a>
<a id='line_1741'>find a place.</a>
<a id='line_1742'></a>
<a id='line_1743'>17:10 And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a father</a>
<a id='line_1744'>and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of silver by the year,</a>
<a id='line_1745'>and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals. So the Levite went in.</a>
<a id='line_1746'></a>
<a id='line_1747'>17:11 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young</a>
<a id='line_1748'>man was unto him as one of his sons.</a>
<a id='line_1749'></a>
<a id='line_1750'>17:12 And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his</a>
<a id='line_1751'>priest, and was in the house of Micah.</a>
<a id='line_1752'></a>
<a id='line_1753'>17:13 Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good,</a>
<a id='line_1754'>seeing I have a Levite to my priest.</a>
<a id='line_1755'></a>
<a id='line_1756'>18:1 In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days the</a>
<a id='line_1757'>tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in; for unto</a>
<a id='line_1758'>that day all their inheritance had not fallen unto them among the</a>
<a id='line_1759'>tribes of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1760'></a>
<a id='line_1761'>18:2 And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from their</a>
<a id='line_1762'>coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to spy out the</a>
<a id='line_1763'>land, and to search it; and they said unto them, Go, search the land:</a>
<a id='line_1764'>who when they came to mount Ephraim, to the house of Micah, they</a>
<a id='line_1765'>lodged there.</a>
<a id='line_1766'></a>
<a id='line_1767'>18:3 When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of the</a>
<a id='line_1768'>young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said unto him,</a>
<a id='line_1769'>Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in this place? and what</a>
<a id='line_1770'>hast thou here?  18:4 And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth</a>
<a id='line_1771'>Micah with me, and hath hired me, and I am his priest.</a>
<a id='line_1772'></a>
<a id='line_1773'>18:5 And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God, that</a>
<a id='line_1774'>we may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.</a>
<a id='line_1775'></a>
<a id='line_1776'>18:6 And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is</a>
<a id='line_1777'>your way wherein ye go.</a>
<a id='line_1778'></a>
<a id='line_1779'>18:7 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the people</a>
<a id='line_1780'>that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the manner of the</a>
<a id='line_1781'>Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no magistrate in the land,</a>
<a id='line_1782'>that might put them to shame in any thing; and they were far from the</a>
<a id='line_1783'>Zidonians, and had no business with any man.</a>
<a id='line_1784'></a>
<a id='line_1785'>18:8 And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and their</a>
<a id='line_1786'>brethren said unto them, What say ye?  18:9 And they said, Arise, that</a>
<a id='line_1787'>we may go up against them: for we have seen the land, and, behold, it</a>
<a id='line_1788'>is very good: and are ye still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to</a>
<a id='line_1789'>possess the land.</a>
<a id='line_1790'></a>
<a id='line_1791'>18:10 When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large</a>
<a id='line_1792'>land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where there is no</a>
<a id='line_1793'>want of any thing that is in the earth.</a>
<a id='line_1794'></a>
<a id='line_1795'>18:11 And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out of</a>
<a id='line_1796'>Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with weapons of</a>
<a id='line_1797'>war.</a>
<a id='line_1798'></a>
<a id='line_1799'>18:12 And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah:</a>
<a id='line_1800'>wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day: behold, it</a>
<a id='line_1801'>is behind Kirjathjearim.</a>
<a id='line_1802'></a>
<a id='line_1803'>18:13 And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the</a>
<a id='line_1804'>house of Micah.</a>
<a id='line_1805'></a>
<a id='line_1806'>18:14 Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of</a>
<a id='line_1807'>Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is in these</a>
<a id='line_1808'>houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image, and a molten image?</a>
<a id='line_1809'>now therefore consider what ye have to do.</a>
<a id='line_1810'></a>
<a id='line_1811'>18:15 And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the young</a>
<a id='line_1812'>man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and saluted him.</a>
<a id='line_1813'></a>
<a id='line_1814'>18:16 And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war,</a>
<a id='line_1815'>which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of the gate.</a>
<a id='line_1816'></a>
<a id='line_1817'>18:17 And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and came</a>
<a id='line_1818'>in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and the</a>
<a id='line_1819'>teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in the entering</a>
<a id='line_1820'>of the gate with the six hundred men that were appointed with weapons</a>
<a id='line_1821'>of war.</a>
<a id='line_1822'></a>
<a id='line_1823'>18:18 And these went into Micah’s house, and fetched the carved image,</a>
<a id='line_1824'>the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then said the</a>
<a id='line_1825'>priest unto them, What do ye?  18:19 And they said unto him, Hold thy</a>
<a id='line_1826'>peace, lay thine hand upon thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a</a>
<a id='line_1827'>father and a priest: is it better for thee to be a priest unto the</a>
<a id='line_1828'>house of one man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family</a>
<a id='line_1829'>in Israel?  18:20 And the priest’s heart was glad, and he took the</a>
<a id='line_1830'>ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst</a>
<a id='line_1831'>of the people.</a>
<a id='line_1832'></a>
<a id='line_1833'>18:21 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the</a>
<a id='line_1834'>cattle and the carriage before them.</a>
<a id='line_1835'></a>
<a id='line_1836'>18:22 And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men</a>
<a id='line_1837'>that were in the houses near to Micah’s house were gathered together,</a>
<a id='line_1838'>and overtook the children of Dan.</a>
<a id='line_1839'></a>
<a id='line_1840'>18:23 And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their</a>
<a id='line_1841'>faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest with</a>
<a id='line_1842'>such a company?  18:24 And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I</a>
<a id='line_1843'>made, and the priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and</a>
<a id='line_1844'>what is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?  18:25 And the</a>
<a id='line_1845'>children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be heard among us,</a>
<a id='line_1846'>lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou lose thy life, with the</a>
<a id='line_1847'>lives of thy household.</a>
<a id='line_1848'></a>
<a id='line_1849'>18:26 And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that</a>
<a id='line_1850'>they were too strong for him, he turned and went back unto his house.</a>
<a id='line_1851'></a>
<a id='line_1852'>18:27 And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest</a>
<a id='line_1853'>which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet</a>
<a id='line_1854'>and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt</a>
<a id='line_1855'>the city with fire.</a>
<a id='line_1856'></a>
<a id='line_1857'>18:28 And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and</a>
<a id='line_1858'>they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lieth</a>
<a id='line_1859'>by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt therein.</a>
<a id='line_1860'></a>
<a id='line_1861'>18:29 And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan</a>
<a id='line_1862'>their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name of the city</a>
<a id='line_1863'>was Laish at the first.</a>
<a id='line_1864'></a>
<a id='line_1865'>18:30 And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan,</a>
<a id='line_1866'>the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests</a>
<a id='line_1867'>to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.</a>
<a id='line_1868'></a>
<a id='line_1869'>18:31 And they set them up Micah’s graven image, which he made, all</a>
<a id='line_1870'>the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.</a>
<a id='line_1871'></a>
<a id='line_1872'>19:1 And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in</a>
<a id='line_1873'>Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of</a>
<a id='line_1874'>mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.</a>
<a id='line_1875'></a>
<a id='line_1876'>19:2 And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away</a>
<a id='line_1877'>from him unto her father’s house to Bethlehemjudah, and was there four</a>
<a id='line_1878'>whole months.</a>
<a id='line_1879'></a>
<a id='line_1880'>19:3 And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly unto</a>
<a id='line_1881'>her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple</a>
<a id='line_1882'>of asses: and she brought him into her father’s house: and when the</a>
<a id='line_1883'>father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced to meet him.</a>
<a id='line_1884'></a>
<a id='line_1885'>19:4 And his father in law, the damsel’s father, retained him; and he</a>
<a id='line_1886'>abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and lodged</a>
<a id='line_1887'>there.</a>
<a id='line_1888'></a>
<a id='line_1889'>19:5 And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early in</a>
<a id='line_1890'>the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel’s father said</a>
<a id='line_1891'>unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a morsel of bread, and</a>
<a id='line_1892'>afterward go your way.</a>
<a id='line_1893'></a>
<a id='line_1894'>19:6 And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them together:</a>
<a id='line_1895'>for the damsel’s father had said unto the man, Be content, I pray</a>
<a id='line_1896'>thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart be merry.</a>
<a id='line_1897'></a>
<a id='line_1898'>19:7 And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged him:</a>
<a id='line_1899'>therefore he lodged there again.</a>
<a id='line_1900'></a>
<a id='line_1901'>19:8 And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart; and</a>
<a id='line_1902'>the damsel’s father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray thee. And they</a>
<a id='line_1903'>tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both of them.</a>
<a id='line_1904'></a>
<a id='line_1905'>19:9 And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and</a>
<a id='line_1906'>his servant, his father in law, the damsel’s father, said unto him,</a>
<a id='line_1907'>Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you tarry all</a>
<a id='line_1908'>night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge here, that thine heart</a>
<a id='line_1909'>may be merry; and to morrow get you early on your way, that thou</a>
<a id='line_1910'>mayest go home.</a>
<a id='line_1911'></a>
<a id='line_1912'>19:10 But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and</a>
<a id='line_1913'>departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and there</a>
<a id='line_1914'>were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was with him.</a>
<a id='line_1915'></a>
<a id='line_1916'>19:11 And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the</a>
<a id='line_1917'>servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us turn in</a>
<a id='line_1918'>into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.</a>
<a id='line_1919'></a>
<a id='line_1920'>19:12 And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither into</a>
<a id='line_1921'>the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of Israel; we will</a>
<a id='line_1922'>pass over to Gibeah.</a>
<a id='line_1923'></a>
<a id='line_1924'>19:13 And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to one</a>
<a id='line_1925'>of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in Ramah.</a>
<a id='line_1926'></a>
<a id='line_1927'>19:14 And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down</a>
<a id='line_1928'>upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to Benjamin.</a>
<a id='line_1929'></a>
<a id='line_1930'>19:15 And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in Gibeah:</a>
<a id='line_1931'>and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of the city: for</a>
<a id='line_1932'>there was no man that took them into his house to lodging.</a>
<a id='line_1933'></a>
<a id='line_1934'>19:16 And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the</a>
<a id='line_1935'>field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he sojourned in</a>
<a id='line_1936'>Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.</a>
<a id='line_1937'></a>
<a id='line_1938'>19:17 And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in</a>
<a id='line_1939'>the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest thou? and</a>
<a id='line_1940'>whence comest thou?  19:18 And he said unto him, We are passing from</a>
<a id='line_1941'>Bethlehemjudah toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and</a>
<a id='line_1942'>I went to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the LORD;</a>
<a id='line_1943'>and there is no man that receiveth me to house.</a>
<a id='line_1944'></a>
<a id='line_1945'>19:19 Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there</a>
<a id='line_1946'>is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for the young</a>
<a id='line_1947'>man which is with thy servants: there is no want of any thing.</a>
<a id='line_1948'></a>
<a id='line_1949'>19:20 And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all thy</a>
<a id='line_1950'>wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.</a>
<a id='line_1951'></a>
<a id='line_1952'>19:21 So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the</a>
<a id='line_1953'>asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.</a>
<a id='line_1954'></a>
<a id='line_1955'>19:22 Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of</a>
<a id='line_1956'>the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about, and</a>
<a id='line_1957'>beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house, the old man,</a>
<a id='line_1958'>saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine house, that we may</a>
<a id='line_1959'>know him.</a>
<a id='line_1960'></a>
<a id='line_1961'>19:23 And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and</a>
<a id='line_1962'>said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so wickedly;</a>
<a id='line_1963'>seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not this folly.</a>
<a id='line_1964'></a>
<a id='line_1965'>19:24 Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them I</a>
<a id='line_1966'>will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them what seemeth</a>
<a id='line_1967'>good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a thing.</a>
<a id='line_1968'></a>
<a id='line_1969'>19:25 But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his</a>
<a id='line_1970'>concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her, and</a>
<a id='line_1971'>abused her all the night until the morning: and when the day began to</a>
<a id='line_1972'>spring, they let her go.</a>
<a id='line_1973'></a>
<a id='line_1974'>19:26 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down at</a>
<a id='line_1975'>the door of the man’s house where her lord was, till it was light.</a>
<a id='line_1976'></a>
<a id='line_1977'>19:27 And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the</a>
<a id='line_1978'>house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman his</a>
<a id='line_1979'>concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and her hands were</a>
<a id='line_1980'>upon the threshold.</a>
<a id='line_1981'></a>
<a id='line_1982'>19:28 And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none</a>
<a id='line_1983'>answered.</a>
<a id='line_1984'></a>
<a id='line_1985'>Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man rose up, and gat him</a>
<a id='line_1986'>unto his place.</a>
<a id='line_1987'></a>
<a id='line_1988'>19:29 And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid</a>
<a id='line_1989'>hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her bones, into</a>
<a id='line_1990'>twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1991'></a>
<a id='line_1992'>19:30 And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such deed</a>
<a id='line_1993'>done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came up out of</a>
<a id='line_1994'>the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of it, take advice, and</a>
<a id='line_1995'>speak your minds.</a>
<a id='line_1996'></a>
<a id='line_1997'>20:1 Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation</a>
<a id='line_1998'>was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, with the</a>
<a id='line_1999'>land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.</a>
<a id='line_2000'></a>
<a id='line_2001'>20:2 And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of</a>
<a id='line_2002'>Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God,</a>
<a id='line_2003'>four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.</a>
<a id='line_2004'></a>
<a id='line_2005'>20:3 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel</a>
<a id='line_2006'>were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of Israel, Tell us,</a>
<a id='line_2007'>how was this wickedness?  20:4 And the Levite, the husband of the</a>
<a id='line_2008'>woman that was slain, answered and said, I came into Gibeah that</a>
<a id='line_2009'>belongeth to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.</a>
<a id='line_2010'></a>
<a id='line_2011'>20:5 And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house round</a>
<a id='line_2012'>about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me: and my concubine</a>
<a id='line_2013'>have they forced, that she is dead.</a>
<a id='line_2014'></a>
<a id='line_2015'>20:6 And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her</a>
<a id='line_2016'>throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for they have</a>
<a id='line_2017'>committed lewdness and folly in Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2018'></a>
<a id='line_2019'>20:7 Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice and</a>
<a id='line_2020'>counsel.</a>
<a id='line_2021'></a>
<a id='line_2022'>20:8 And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of</a>
<a id='line_2023'>us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his house.</a>
<a id='line_2024'></a>
<a id='line_2025'>20:9 But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we</a>
<a id='line_2026'>will go up by lot against it; 20:10 And we will take ten men of an</a>
<a id='line_2027'>hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a</a>
<a id='line_2028'>thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the</a>
<a id='line_2029'>people, that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin,</a>
<a id='line_2030'>according to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2031'></a>
<a id='line_2032'>20:11 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit</a>
<a id='line_2033'>together as one man.</a>
<a id='line_2034'></a>
<a id='line_2035'>20:12 And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of</a>
<a id='line_2036'>Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among you?</a>
<a id='line_2037'>20:13 Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which</a>
<a id='line_2038'>are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from</a>
<a id='line_2039'>Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not hearken to the voice of</a>
<a id='line_2040'>their brethren the children of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2041'></a>
<a id='line_2042'>20:14 But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out of</a>
<a id='line_2043'>the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the children of</a>
<a id='line_2044'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2045'></a>
<a id='line_2046'>20:15 And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of</a>
<a id='line_2047'>the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside the</a>
<a id='line_2048'>inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred chosen men.</a>
<a id='line_2049'></a>
<a id='line_2050'>20:16 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men</a>
<a id='line_2051'>lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth, and not</a>
<a id='line_2052'>miss.</a>
<a id='line_2053'></a>
<a id='line_2054'>20:17 And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four</a>
<a id='line_2055'>hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of war.</a>
<a id='line_2056'></a>
<a id='line_2057'>20:18 And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of</a>
<a id='line_2058'>God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go up first</a>
<a id='line_2059'>to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And the LORD said,</a>
<a id='line_2060'>Judah shall go up first.</a>
<a id='line_2061'></a>
<a id='line_2062'>20:19 And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and encamped</a>
<a id='line_2063'>against Gibeah.</a>
<a id='line_2064'></a>
<a id='line_2065'>20:20 And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and</a>
<a id='line_2066'>the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against them at</a>
<a id='line_2067'>Gibeah.</a>
<a id='line_2068'></a>
<a id='line_2069'>20:21 And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and</a>
<a id='line_2070'>destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty and two</a>
<a id='line_2071'>thousand men.</a>
<a id='line_2072'></a>
<a id='line_2073'>20:22 And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and set</a>
<a id='line_2074'>their battle again in array in the place where they put themselves in</a>
<a id='line_2075'>array the first day.</a>
<a id='line_2076'></a>
<a id='line_2077'>20:23 (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2078'>until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up again</a>
<a id='line_2079'>to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother? And the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2080'>said, Go up against him.)  20:24 And the children of Israel came near</a>
<a id='line_2081'>against the children of Benjamin the second day.</a>
<a id='line_2082'></a>
<a id='line_2083'>20:25 And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second</a>
<a id='line_2084'>day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel again</a>
<a id='line_2085'>eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.</a>
<a id='line_2086'></a>
<a id='line_2087'>20:26 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up,</a>
<a id='line_2088'>and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the</a>
<a id='line_2089'>LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and</a>
<a id='line_2090'>peace offerings before the LORD.</a>
<a id='line_2091'></a>
<a id='line_2092'>20:27 And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark of</a>
<a id='line_2093'>the covenant of God was there in those days, 20:28 And Phinehas, the</a>
<a id='line_2094'>son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days,)</a>
<a id='line_2095'>saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle against the children of</a>
<a id='line_2096'>Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for</a>
<a id='line_2097'>to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand.</a>
<a id='line_2098'></a>
<a id='line_2099'>20:29 And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.</a>
<a id='line_2100'></a>
<a id='line_2101'>20:30 And the children of Israel went up against the children of</a>
<a id='line_2102'>Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against Gibeah,</a>
<a id='line_2103'>as at other times.</a>
<a id='line_2104'></a>
<a id='line_2105'>20:31 And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and</a>
<a id='line_2106'>were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the people,</a>
<a id='line_2107'>and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which one goeth up to</a>
<a id='line_2108'>the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in the field, about thirty</a>
<a id='line_2109'>men of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2110'></a>
<a id='line_2111'>20:32 And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down before</a>
<a id='line_2112'>us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said, Let us flee, and</a>
<a id='line_2113'>draw them from the city unto the highways.</a>
<a id='line_2114'></a>
<a id='line_2115'>20:33 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put</a>
<a id='line_2116'>themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of Israel came</a>
<a id='line_2117'>forth out of their places, even out of the meadows of Gibeah.</a>
<a id='line_2118'></a>
<a id='line_2119'>20:34 And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of all</a>
<a id='line_2120'>Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that evil was near</a>
<a id='line_2121'>them.</a>
<a id='line_2122'></a>
<a id='line_2123'>20:35 And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of</a>
<a id='line_2124'>Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five thousand</a>
<a id='line_2125'>and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.</a>
<a id='line_2126'></a>
<a id='line_2127'>20:36 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for the</a>
<a id='line_2128'>men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they trusted unto</a>
<a id='line_2129'>the liers in wait which they had set beside Gibeah.</a>
<a id='line_2130'></a>
<a id='line_2131'>20:37 And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the</a>
<a id='line_2132'>liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city with the</a>
<a id='line_2133'>edge of the sword.</a>
<a id='line_2134'></a>
<a id='line_2135'>20:38 Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and</a>
<a id='line_2136'>the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with smoke rise</a>
<a id='line_2137'>up out of the city.</a>
<a id='line_2138'></a>
<a id='line_2139'>20:39 And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin began</a>
<a id='line_2140'>to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons: for they</a>
<a id='line_2141'>said, Surely they are smitten down before us, as in the first battle.</a>
<a id='line_2142'></a>
<a id='line_2143'>20:40 But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a</a>
<a id='line_2144'>pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and, behold, the</a>
<a id='line_2145'>flame of the city ascended up to heaven.</a>
<a id='line_2146'></a>
<a id='line_2147'>20:41 And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin</a>
<a id='line_2148'>were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.</a>
<a id='line_2149'></a>
<a id='line_2150'>20:42 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel unto</a>
<a id='line_2151'>the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them; and them</a>
<a id='line_2152'>which came out of the cities they destroyed in the midst of them.</a>
<a id='line_2153'></a>
<a id='line_2154'>20:43 Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased them,</a>
<a id='line_2155'>and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward the</a>
<a id='line_2156'>sunrising.</a>
<a id='line_2157'></a>
<a id='line_2158'>20:44 And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these were</a>
<a id='line_2159'>men of valour.</a>
<a id='line_2160'></a>
<a id='line_2161'>20:45 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock of</a>
<a id='line_2162'>Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men;</a>
<a id='line_2163'>and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew two thousand men of</a>
<a id='line_2164'>them.</a>
<a id='line_2165'></a>
<a id='line_2166'>20:46 So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and five</a>
<a id='line_2167'>thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of valour.</a>
<a id='line_2168'></a>
<a id='line_2169'>20:47 But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the</a>
<a id='line_2170'>rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.</a>
<a id='line_2171'></a>
<a id='line_2172'>20:48 And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of</a>
<a id='line_2173'>Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well the men</a>
<a id='line_2174'>of every city, as the beast, and all that came to hand: also they set</a>
<a id='line_2175'>on fire all the cities that they came to.</a>
<a id='line_2176'></a>
<a id='line_2177'>21:1 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall</a>
<a id='line_2178'>not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.</a>
<a id='line_2179'></a>
<a id='line_2180'>21:2 And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till</a>
<a id='line_2181'>even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore; 21:3 And</a>
<a id='line_2182'>said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in Israel, that</a>
<a id='line_2183'>there should be to day one tribe lacking in Israel?  21:4 And it came</a>
<a id='line_2184'>to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an</a>
<a id='line_2185'>altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.</a>
<a id='line_2186'></a>
<a id='line_2187'>21:5 And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the</a>
<a id='line_2188'>tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto the LORD?</a>
<a id='line_2189'>For they had made a great oath concerning him that came not up to the</a>
<a id='line_2190'>LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be put to death.</a>
<a id='line_2191'></a>
<a id='line_2192'>21:6 And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their</a>
<a id='line_2193'>brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.</a>
<a id='line_2194'></a>
<a id='line_2195'>21:7 How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have</a>
<a id='line_2196'>sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters to</a>
<a id='line_2197'>wives?  21:8 And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel</a>
<a id='line_2198'>that came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came none</a>
<a id='line_2199'>to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.</a>
<a id='line_2200'></a>
<a id='line_2201'>21:9 For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the</a>
<a id='line_2202'>inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.</a>
<a id='line_2203'></a>
<a id='line_2204'>21:10 And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the</a>
<a id='line_2205'>valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the inhabitants</a>
<a id='line_2206'>of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with the women and the</a>
<a id='line_2207'>children.</a>
<a id='line_2208'></a>
<a id='line_2209'>21:11 And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly destroy</a>
<a id='line_2210'>every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.</a>
<a id='line_2211'></a>
<a id='line_2212'>21:12 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four</a>
<a id='line_2213'>hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any male:</a>
<a id='line_2214'>and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is in the land of</a>
<a id='line_2215'>Canaan.</a>
<a id='line_2216'></a>
<a id='line_2217'>21:13 And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children of</a>
<a id='line_2218'>Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call peaceably unto</a>
<a id='line_2219'>them.</a>
<a id='line_2220'></a>
<a id='line_2221'>21:14 And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives</a>
<a id='line_2222'>which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and yet so</a>
<a id='line_2223'>they sufficed them not.</a>
<a id='line_2224'></a>
<a id='line_2225'>21:15 And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the LORD</a>
<a id='line_2226'>had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2227'></a>
<a id='line_2228'>21:16 Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for</a>
<a id='line_2229'>wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out of</a>
<a id='line_2230'>Benjamin?  21:17 And they said, There must be an inheritance for them</a>
<a id='line_2231'>that be escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of</a>
<a id='line_2232'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_2233'></a>
<a id='line_2234'>21:18 Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the</a>
<a id='line_2235'>children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that giveth a wife</a>
<a id='line_2236'>to Benjamin.</a>
<a id='line_2237'></a>
<a id='line_2238'>21:19 Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh</a>
<a id='line_2239'>yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east</a>
<a id='line_2240'>side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the</a>
<a id='line_2241'>south of Lebonah.</a>
<a id='line_2242'></a>
<a id='line_2243'>21:20 Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go</a>
<a id='line_2244'>and lie in wait in the vineyards; 21:21 And see, and, behold, if the</a>
<a id='line_2245'>daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in dances, then come ye out of</a>
<a id='line_2246'>the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of</a>
<a id='line_2247'>Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin.</a>
<a id='line_2248'></a>
<a id='line_2249'>21:22 And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come unto</a>
<a id='line_2250'>us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable unto them</a>
<a id='line_2251'>for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man his wife in the</a>
<a id='line_2252'>war: for ye did not give unto them at this time, that ye should be</a>
<a id='line_2253'>guilty.</a>
<a id='line_2254'></a>
<a id='line_2255'>21:23 And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives,</a>
<a id='line_2256'>according to their number, of them that danced, whom they caught: and</a>
<a id='line_2257'>they went and returned unto their inheritance, and repaired the</a>
<a id='line_2258'>cities, and dwelt in them.</a>
<a id='line_2259'></a>
<a id='line_2260'>21:24 And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every</a>
<a id='line_2261'>man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from thence</a>
<a id='line_2262'>every man to his inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_2263'></a>
<a id='line_2264'>21:25 In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that</a>
<a id='line_2265'>which was right in his own eyes.</a>
<a id='line_2266'></a>
<a id='line_2267'></a>
