                    <a id='line_0'>Chapter XXXVII: Conversion Of The Barbarians To</a>
<a id='line_1'>      Christianity.—Part I.</a>
<a id='line_2'></a>

<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'>      The indissoluble connection of civil and ecclesiastical affairs</a>
<a id='line_8'>      has compelled, and encouraged, me to relate the progress, the</a>
<a id='line_9'>      persecutions, the establishment, the divisions, the final</a>
<a id='line_10'>      triumph, and the gradual corruption, of Christianity. I have</a>
<a id='line_11'>      purposely delayed the consideration of two religious events,</a>
<a id='line_12'>      interesting in the study of human nature, and important in the</a>
<a id='line_13'>      decline and fall of the Roman empire. I. The institution of the</a>
<a id='line_14'>      monastic life; 1 and, II. The conversion of the northern</a>
<a id='line_15'>      Barbarians.</a>
<a id='line_16'></a>
<a id='line_17'>      1 (return) [ The origin of the monastic institution has been</a>
<a id='line_18'>      laboriously discussed by Thomassin (Discipline de l’Eglise, tom.</a>
<a id='line_19'>      i. p. 1119-1426) and Helyot, (Hist. des Ordres Monastiques, tom.</a>
<a id='line_20'>      i. p. 1-66.) These authors are very learned, and tolerably</a>
<a id='line_21'>      honest, and their difference of opinion shows the subject in its</a>
<a id='line_22'>      full extent. Yet the cautious Protestant, who distrusts any</a>
<a id='line_23'>      popish guides, may consult the seventh book of Bingham’s</a>
<a id='line_24'>      Christian Antiquities.]</a>
<a id='line_25'></a>
<a id='line_26'>      I. Prosperity and peace introduced the distinction of the vulgar</a>
<a id='line_27'>      and the Ascetic Christians. 2 The loose and imperfect practice of</a>
<a id='line_28'>      religion satisfied the conscience of the multitude. The prince or</a>
<a id='line_29'>      magistrate, the soldier or merchant, reconciled their fervent</a>
<a id='line_30'>      zeal, and implicit faith, with the exercise of their profession,</a>
<a id='line_31'>      the pursuit of their interest, and the indulgence of their</a>
<a id='line_32'>      passions: but the Ascetics, who obeyed and abused the rigid</a>
<a id='line_33'>      precepts of the gospel, were inspired by the savage enthusiasm</a>
<a id='line_34'>      which represents man as a criminal, and God as a tyrant. They</a>
<a id='line_35'>      seriously renounced the business, and the pleasures, of the age;</a>
<a id='line_36'>      abjured the use of wine, of flesh, and of marriage; chastised</a>
<a id='line_37'>      their body, mortified their affections, and embraced a life of</a>
<a id='line_38'>      misery, as the price of eternal happiness. In the reign of</a>
<a id='line_39'>      Constantine, the Ascetics fled from a profane and degenerate</a>
<a id='line_40'>      world, to perpetual solitude, or religious society. Like the</a>
<a id='line_41'>      first Christians of Jerusalem, 3 311 they resigned the use, or</a>
<a id='line_42'>      the property of their temporal possessions; established regular</a>
<a id='line_43'>      communities of the same sex, and a similar disposition; and</a>
<a id='line_44'>      assumed the names of Hermits, Monks, and Anachorets, expressive</a>
<a id='line_45'>      of their lonely retreat in a natural or artificial desert. They</a>
<a id='line_46'>      soon acquired the respect of the world, which they despised; and</a>
<a id='line_47'>      the loudest applause was bestowed on this Divine Philosophy, 4</a>
<a id='line_48'>      which surpassed, without the aid of science or reason, the</a>
<a id='line_49'>      laborious virtues of the Grecian schools. The monks might indeed</a>
<a id='line_50'>      contend with the Stoics, in the contempt of fortune, of pain, and</a>
<a id='line_51'>      of death: the Pythagorean silence and submission were revived in</a>
<a id='line_52'>      their servile discipline; and they disdained, as firmly as the</a>
<a id='line_53'>      Cynics themselves, all the forms and decencies of civil society.</a>
<a id='line_54'>      But the votaries of this Divine Philosophy aspired to imitate a</a>
<a id='line_55'>      purer and more perfect model. They trod in the footsteps of the</a>
<a id='line_56'>      prophets, who had retired to the desert; 5 and they restored the</a>
<a id='line_57'>      devout and contemplative life, which had been instituted by the</a>
<a id='line_58'>      Essenians, in Palestine and Egypt. The philosophic eye of Pliny</a>
<a id='line_59'>      had surveyed with astonishment a solitary people, who dwelt among</a>
<a id='line_60'>      the palm-trees near the Dead Sea; who subsisted without money,</a>
<a id='line_61'>      who were propagated without women; and who derived from the</a>
<a id='line_62'>      disgust and repentance of mankind a perpetual supply of voluntary</a>

<a id='line_108'></a>
<a id='line_109'>      Egypt, the fruitful parent of superstition, afforded the first</a>
<a id='line_110'>      example of the monastic life. Antony, 7 an illiterate 8 youth of</a>
<a id='line_111'>      the lower parts of Thebais, distributed his patrimony, 9 deserted</a>
<a id='line_112'>      his family and native home, and executed his monastic penance</a>
<a id='line_113'>      with original and intrepid fanaticism. After a long and painful</a>
<a id='line_114'>      novitiate, among the tombs, and in a ruined tower, he boldly</a>
<a id='line_115'>      advanced into the desert three days’ journey to the eastward of</a>
<a id='line_116'>      the Nile; discovered a lonely spot, which possessed the</a>
<a id='line_117'>      advantages of shade and water, and fixed his last residence on</a>
<a id='line_118'>      Mount Colzim, near the Red Sea; where an ancient monastery still</a>
<a id='line_119'>      preserves the name and memory of the saint. 10 The curious</a>
<a id='line_120'>      devotion of the Christians pursued him to the desert; and when he</a>
<a id='line_121'>      was obliged to appear at Alexandria, in the face of mankind, he</a>
<a id='line_122'>      supported his fame with discretion and dignity. He enjoyed the</a>
<a id='line_123'>      friendship of Athanasius, whose doctrine he approved; and the</a>
<a id='line_124'>      Egyptian peasant respectfully declined a respectful invitation</a>
<a id='line_125'>      from the emperor Constantine. The venerable patriarch (for Antony</a>
<a id='line_126'>      attained the age of one hundred and five years) beheld the</a>
<a id='line_127'>      numerous progeny which had been formed by his example and his</a>
<a id='line_128'>      lessons. The prolific colonies of monks multiplied with rapid</a>
<a id='line_129'>      increase on the sands of Libya, upon the rocks of Thebais, and in</a>
<a id='line_130'>      the cities of the Nile. To the south of Alexandria, the mountain,</a>
<a id='line_131'>      and adjacent desert, of Nitria, were peopled by five thousand</a>
<a id='line_132'>      anachorets; and the traveller may still investigate the ruins of</a>
<a id='line_133'>      fifty monasteries, which were planted in that barren soil by the</a>
<a id='line_134'>      disciples of Antony. 11 In the Upper Thebais, the vacant island</a>
<a id='line_135'>      of Tabenne, 12 was occupied by Pachomius and fourteen hundred of</a>
<a id='line_136'>      his brethren. That holy abbot successively founded nine</a>
<a id='line_137'>      monasteries of men, and one of women; and the festival of Easter</a>
<a id='line_138'>      sometimes collected fifty thousand religious persons, who</a>
<a id='line_139'>      followed his angelic rule of discipline. 13 The stately and</a>
<a id='line_140'>      populous city of Oxyrinchus, the seat of Christian orthodoxy, had</a>
<a id='line_141'>      devoted the temples, the public edifices, and even the ramparts,</a>
<a id='line_142'>      to pious and charitable uses; and the bishop, who might preach in</a>
<a id='line_143'>      twelve churches, computed ten thousand females and twenty</a>
<a id='line_144'>      thousand males, of the monastic profession. 14 The Egyptians, who</a>
<a id='line_145'>      gloried in this marvellous revolution, were disposed to hope, and</a>
<a id='line_146'>      to believe, that the number of the monks was equal to the</a>
<a id='line_147'>      remainder of the people; 15 and posterity might repeat the</a>
<a id='line_148'>      saying, which had formerly been applied to the sacred animals of</a>
<a id='line_149'>      the same country, That in Egypt it was less difficult to find a</a>

<a id='line_208'>      Athanasius introduced into Rome the knowledge and practice of the</a>
<a id='line_209'>      monastic life; and a school of this new philosophy was opened by</a>
<a id='line_210'>      the disciples of Antony, who accompanied their primate to the</a>
<a id='line_211'>      holy threshold of the Vatican. The strange and savage appearance</a>
<a id='line_212'>      of these Egyptians excited, at first, horror and contempt, and,</a>
<a id='line_213'>      at length, applause and zealous imitation. The senators, and more</a>
<a id='line_214'>      especially the matrons, transformed their palaces and villas into</a>
<a id='line_215'>      religious houses; and the narrow institution of six vestals was</a>
<a id='line_216'>      eclipsed by the frequent monasteries, which were seated on the</a>
<a id='line_217'>      ruins of ancient temples, and in the midst of the Roman forum. 16</a>
<a id='line_218'>      Inflamed by the example of Antony, a Syrian youth, whose name was</a>
<a id='line_219'>      Hilarion, 17 fixed his dreary abode on a sandy beach, between the</a>
<a id='line_220'>      sea and a morass, about seven miles from Gaza. The austere</a>
<a id='line_221'>      penance, in which he persisted forty-eight years, diffused a</a>
<a id='line_222'>      similar enthusiasm; and the holy man was followed by a train of</a>
<a id='line_223'>      two or three thousand anachorets, whenever he visited the</a>
<a id='line_224'>      innumerable monasteries of Palestine. The fame of Basil 18 is</a>
<a id='line_225'>      immortal in the monastic history of the East. With a mind that</a>
<a id='line_226'>      had tasted the learning and eloquence of Athens; with an ambition</a>
<a id='line_227'>      scarcely to be satisfied with the archbishopric of Caesarea,</a>
<a id='line_228'>      Basil retired to a savage solitude in Pontus; and deigned, for a</a>
<a id='line_229'>      while, to give laws to the spiritual colonies which he profusely</a>
<a id='line_230'>      scattered along the coast of the Black Sea. In the West, Martin</a>
<a id='line_231'>      of Tours, 19 a soldier, a hermit, a bishop, and a saint,</a>
<a id='line_232'>      established the monasteries of Gaul; two thousand of his</a>
<a id='line_233'>      disciples followed him to the grave; and his eloquent historian</a>
<a id='line_234'>      challenges the deserts of Thebais to produce, in a more favorable</a>
<a id='line_235'>      climate, a champion of equal virtue. The progress of the monks</a>
<a id='line_236'>      was not less rapid, or universal, than that of Christianity</a>
<a id='line_237'>      itself. Every province, and, at last, every city, of the empire,</a>
<a id='line_238'>      was filled with their increasing multitudes; and the bleak and</a>
<a id='line_239'>      barren isles, from Lerins to Lipari, that arose out of the Tuscan</a>
<a id='line_240'>      Sea, were chosen by the anachorets for the place of their</a>
<a id='line_241'>      voluntary exile. An easy and perpetual intercourse by sea and</a>
<a id='line_242'>      land connected the provinces of the Roman world; and the life of</a>

<a id='line_335'>      were employed to secure those proselytes who might bestow wealth</a>
<a id='line_336'>      or dignity on the monastic profession. The indignant father</a>
<a id='line_337'>      bewailed the loss, perhaps, of an only son; 27 the credulous maid</a>
<a id='line_338'>      was betrayed by vanity to violate the laws of nature; and the</a>
<a id='line_339'>      matron aspired to imaginary perfection, by renouncing the virtues</a>

<a id='line_341'>      Jerom; 28 and the profane title of mother-in-law of God 29</a>
<a id='line_342'>      tempted that illustrious widow to consecrate the virginity of her</a>
<a id='line_343'>      daughter Eustochium. By the advice, and in the company, of her</a>

<a id='line_1245'></a>
<a id='line_1246'>      Christianity, which opened the gates of Heaven to the Barbarians,</a>
<a id='line_1247'>      introduced an important change in their moral and political</a>
<a id='line_1248'>      condition. They received, at the same time, the use of letters,</a>
<a id='line_1249'>      so essential to a religion whose doctrines are contained in a</a>
<a id='line_1250'>      sacred book; and while they studied the divine truth, their minds</a>
<a id='line_1251'>      were insensibly enlarged by the distant view of history, of</a>
<a id='line_1252'>      nature, of the arts, and of society. The version of the</a>
<a id='line_1253'>      Scriptures into their native tongue, which had facilitated their</a>
<a id='line_1254'>      conversion, must excite among their clergy some curiosity to read</a>
<a id='line_1255'>      the original text, to understand the sacred liturgy of the</a>
<a id='line_1256'>      church, and to examine, in the writings of the fathers, the chain</a>
<a id='line_1257'>      of ecclesiastical tradition. These spiritual gifts were preserved</a>
<a id='line_1258'>      in the Greek and Latin languages, which concealed the inestimable</a>
<a id='line_1259'>      monuments of ancient learning. The immortal productions of</a>
<a id='line_1260'>      Virgil, Cicero, and Livy, which were accessible to the Christian</a>
<a id='line_1261'>      Barbarians, maintained a silent intercourse between the reign of</a>
<a id='line_1262'>      Augustus and the times of Clovis and Charlemagne. The emulation</a>
<a id='line_1263'>      of mankind was encouraged by the remembrance of a more perfect</a>
<a id='line_1264'>      state; and the flame of science was secretly kept alive, to warm</a>
<a id='line_1265'>      and enlighten the mature age of the Western world.</a>
<a id='line_1266'></a>
<a id='line_1267'>      In the most corrupt state of Christianity, the Barbarians might</a>
<a id='line_1268'>      learn justice from the law, and mercy from the gospel; and if the</a>
<a id='line_1269'>      knowledge of their duty was insufficient to guide their actions,</a>
<a id='line_1270'>      or to regulate their passions, they were sometimes restrained by</a>
<a id='line_1271'>      conscience, and frequently punished by remorse. But the direct</a>
<a id='line_1272'>      authority of religion was less effectual than the holy communion,</a>
<a id='line_1273'>      which united them with their Christian brethren in spiritual</a>
<a id='line_1274'>      friendship. The influence of these sentiments contributed to</a>
<a id='line_1275'>      secure their fidelity in the service, or the alliance, of the</a>
<a id='line_1276'>      Romans, to alleviate the horrors of war, to moderate the</a>
<a id='line_1277'>      insolence of conquest, and to preserve, in the downfall of the</a>
<a id='line_1278'>      empire, a permanent respect for the name and institutions of</a>
<a id='line_1279'>      Rome. In the days of Paganism, the priests of Gaul and Germany</a>
<a id='line_1280'>      reigned over the people, and controlled the jurisdiction of the</a>
<a id='line_1281'>      magistrates; and the zealous proselytes transferred an equal, or</a>
<a id='line_1282'>      more ample, measure of devout obedience, to the pontiffs of the</a>
<a id='line_1283'>      Christian faith. The sacred character of the bishops was</a>
<a id='line_1284'>      supported by their temporal possessions; they obtained an</a>
<a id='line_1285'>      honorable seat in the legislative assemblies of soldiers and</a>
<a id='line_1286'>      freemen; and it was their interest, as well as their duty, to</a>
<a id='line_1287'>      mollify, by peaceful counsels, the fierce spirit of the</a>
<a id='line_1288'>      Barbarians. The perpetual correspondence of the Latin clergy, the</a>
<a id='line_1289'>      frequent pilgrimages to Rome and Jerusalem, and the growing</a>
<a id='line_1290'>      authority of the popes, cemented the union of the Christian</a>
<a id='line_1291'>      republic, and gradually produced the similar manners, and common</a>
<a id='line_1292'>      jurisprudence, which have distinguished, from the rest of</a>
<a id='line_1293'>      mankind, the independent, and even hostile, nations of modern</a>
<a id='line_1294'>      Europe.</a>
<a id='line_1295'></a>
<a id='line_1296'>      But the operation of these causes was checked and retarded by the</a>
<a id='line_1297'>      unfortunate accident, which infused a deadly poison into the cup</a>
<a id='line_1298'>      of Salvation. Whatever might be the early sentiments of Ulphilas,</a>
<a id='line_1299'>      his connections with the empire and the church were formed during</a>
<a id='line_1300'>      the reign of Arianism. The apostle of the Goths subscribed the</a>
<a id='line_1301'>      creed of Rimini; professed with freedom, and perhaps with</a>
<a id='line_1302'>      sincerity, that the Son was not equal, or consubstantial to the</a>
<a id='line_1303'>      Father; 83 communicated these errors to the clergy and people;</a>
<a id='line_1304'>      and infected the Barbaric world with a heresy, 84 which the great</a>
<a id='line_1305'>      Theodosius proscribed and extinguished among the Romans. The</a>
<a id='line_1306'>      temper and understanding of the new proselytes were not adapted</a>
<a id='line_1307'>      to metaphysical subtilties; but they strenuously maintained, what</a>
<a id='line_1308'>      they had piously received, as the pure and genuine doctrines of</a>
<a id='line_1309'>      Christianity. The advantage of preaching and expounding the</a>
<a id='line_1310'>      Scriptures in the Teutonic language promoted the apostolic labors</a>
<a id='line_1311'>      of Ulphilas and his successors; and they ordained a competent</a>
<a id='line_1312'>      number of bishops and presbyters for the instruction of the</a>
<a id='line_1313'>      kindred tribes. The Ostrogoths, the Burgundians, the Suevi, and</a>
<a id='line_1314'>      the Vandals, who had listened to the eloquence of the Latin</a>
<a id='line_1315'>      clergy, 85 preferred the more intelligible lessons of their</a>
<a id='line_1316'>      domestic teachers; and Arianism was adopted as the national faith</a>
<a id='line_1317'>      of the warlike converts, who were seated on the ruins of the</a>
<a id='line_1318'>      Western empire. This irreconcilable difference of religion was a</a>
<a id='line_1319'>      perpetual source of jealousy and hatred; and the reproach of</a>
<a id='line_1320'>      Barbarian was imbittered by the more odious epithet of Heretic.</a>
<a id='line_1321'>      The heroes of the North, who had submitted, with some reluctance,</a>
<a id='line_1322'>      to believe that all their ancestors were in hell, 86 were</a>
<a id='line_1323'>      astonished and exasperated to learn, that they themselves had</a>
<a id='line_1324'>      only changed the mode of their eternal condemnation. Instead of</a>
<a id='line_1325'>      the smooth applause, which Christian kings are accustomed to</a>
<a id='line_1326'>      expect from their royal prelates, the orthodox bishops and their</a>
<a id='line_1327'>      clergy were in a state of opposition to the Arian courts; and</a>
<a id='line_1328'>      their indiscreet opposition frequently became criminal, and might</a>
<a id='line_1329'>      sometimes be dangerous. 87 The pulpit, that safe and sacred organ</a>
<a id='line_1330'>      of sedition, resounded with the names of Pharaoh and Holofernes;</a>
<a id='line_1331'>      88 the public discontent was inflamed by the hope or promise of a</a>
<a id='line_1332'>      glorious deliverance; and the seditious saints were tempted to</a>
<a id='line_1333'>      promote the accomplishment of their own predictions.</a>
<a id='line_1334'>      Notwithstanding these provocations, the Catholics of Gaul, Spain,</a>
<a id='line_1335'>      and Italy, enjoyed, under the reign of the Arians, the free and</a>
<a id='line_1336'>      peaceful exercise of their religion. Their haughty masters</a>
<a id='line_1337'>      respected the zeal of a numerous people, resolved to die at the</a>
<a id='line_1338'>      foot of their altars; and the example of their devout constancy</a>
<a id='line_1339'>      was admired and imitated by the Barbarians themselves. The</a>
<a id='line_1340'>      conquerors evaded, however, the disgraceful reproach, or</a>
<a id='line_1341'>      confession, of fear, by attributing their toleration to the</a>
<a id='line_1342'>      liberal motives of reason and humanity; and while they affected</a>

<a id='line_1394'>      the field, still presumed to dispute his will in synods and</a>
<a id='line_1395'>      churches; and his ferocious mind was incapable of fear or of</a>
<a id='line_1396'>      compassion. His Catholic subjects were oppressed by intolerant</a>
<a id='line_1397'>      laws and arbitrary punishments. The language of Genseric was</a>
<a id='line_1398'>      furious and formidable; the knowledge of his intentions might</a>
<a id='line_1399'>      justify the most unfavorable interpretation of his actions; and</a>
<a id='line_1400'>      the Arians were reproached with the frequent executions which</a>
<a id='line_1401'>      stained the palace and the dominions of the tyrant. Arms and</a>
<a id='line_1402'>      ambition were, however, the ruling passions of the monarch of the</a>
<a id='line_1403'>      sea. But Hunneric, his inglorious son, who seemed to inherit only</a>
<a id='line_1404'>      his vices, tormented the Catholics with the same unrelenting fury</a>
<a id='line_1405'>      which had been fatal to his brother, his nephews, and the friends</a>
<a id='line_1406'>      and favorites of his father; and even to the Arian patriarch, who</a>
<a id='line_1407'>      was inhumanly burnt alive in the midst of Carthage. The religious</a>
<a id='line_1408'>      war was preceded and prepared by an insidious truce; persecution</a>
<a id='line_1409'>      was made the serious and important business of the Vandal court;</a>

<a id='line_1411'>      revenged the injuries, without contributing to the deliverance,</a>
<a id='line_1412'>      of the church. The throne of Africa was successively filled by</a>
<a id='line_1413'>      the two nephews of Hunneric; by Gundamund, who reigned about</a>
<a id='line_1414'>      twelve, and by Thrasimund, who governed the nation about</a>
<a id='line_1415'>      twenty-seven, years. Their administration was hostile and</a>
<a id='line_1416'>      oppressive to the orthodox party. Gundamund appeared to emulate,</a>
<a id='line_1417'>      or even to surpass, the cruelty of his uncle; and, if at length</a>
<a id='line_1418'>      he relented, if he recalled the bishops, and restored the freedom</a>
<a id='line_1419'>      of Athanasian worship, a premature death intercepted the benefits</a>
<a id='line_1420'>      of his tardy clemency. His brother, Thrasimund, was the greatest</a>
<a id='line_1421'>      and most accomplished of the Vandal kings, whom he excelled in</a>
<a id='line_1422'>      beauty, prudence, and magnanimity of soul. But this magnanimous</a>
<a id='line_1423'>      character was degraded by his intolerant zeal and deceitful</a>
<a id='line_1424'>      clemency. Instead of threats and tortures, he employed the</a>
<a id='line_1425'>      gentle, but efficacious, powers of seduction. Wealth, dignity,</a>
<a id='line_1426'>      and the royal favor, were the liberal rewards of apostasy; the</a>
<a id='line_1427'>      Catholics, who had violated the laws, might purchase their pardon</a>
<a id='line_1428'>      by the renunciation of their faith; and whenever Thrasimund</a>

<a id='line_1430'>      indiscretion of his adversaries furnished him with a specious</a>

<a id='line_1432'>      and he exacted from his successor a solemn oath, that he would</a>

<a id='line_1491'>      martyr and one confessor were selected among the Catholic</a>
<a id='line_1492'>      bishops; twenty-eight escaped by flight, and eighty-eight by</a>
<a id='line_1493'>      conformity; forty-six were sent into Corsica to cut timber for</a>
<a id='line_1494'>      the royal navy; and three hundred and two were banished to the</a>
<a id='line_1495'>      different parts of Africa, exposed to the insults of their</a>
<a id='line_1496'>      enemies, and carefully deprived of all the temporal and spiritual</a>
<a id='line_1497'>      comforts of life. 95 The hardships of ten years’ exile must have</a>
<a id='line_1498'>      reduced their numbers; and if they had complied with the law of</a>
<a id='line_1499'>      Thrasimund, which prohibited any episcopal consecrations, the</a>
<a id='line_1500'>      orthodox church of Africa must have expired with the lives of its</a>
<a id='line_1501'>      actual members. They disobeyed, and their disobedience was</a>
<a id='line_1502'>      punished by a second exile of two hundred and twenty bishops into</a>
<a id='line_1503'>      Sardinia; where they languished fifteen years, till the accession</a>
<a id='line_1504'>      of the gracious Hilderic. 96 The two islands were judiciously</a>
<a id='line_1505'>      chosen by the malice of their Arian tyrants. Seneca, from his own</a>
<a id='line_1506'>      experience, has deplored and exaggerated the miserable state of</a>
<a id='line_1507'>      Corsica, 97 and the plenty of Sardinia was overbalanced by the</a>
<a id='line_1508'>      unwholesome quality of the air. 98 III. The zeal of Genseric and</a>
<a id='line_1509'>      his successors, for the conversion of the Catholics, must have</a>
<a id='line_1510'>      rendered them still more jealous to guard the purity of the</a>
<a id='line_1511'>      Vandal faith. Before the churches were finally shut, it was a</a>
<a id='line_1512'>      crime to appear in a Barbarian dress; and those who presumed to</a>
<a id='line_1513'>      neglect the royal mandate were rudely dragged backwards by their</a>
<a id='line_1514'>      long hair. 99 The palatine officers, who refused to profess the</a>
<a id='line_1515'>      religion of their prince, were ignominiously stripped of their</a>
<a id='line_1516'>      honors and employments; banished to Sardinia and Sicily; or</a>
<a id='line_1517'>      condemned to the servile labors of slaves and peasants in the</a>
<a id='line_1518'>      fields of Utica. In the districts which had been peculiarly</a>
<a id='line_1519'>      allotted to the Vandals, the exercise of the Catholic worship was</a>
<a id='line_1520'>      more strictly prohibited; and severe penalties were denounced</a>
<a id='line_1521'>      against the guilt both of the missionary and the proselyte. By</a>
<a id='line_1522'>      these arts, the faith of the Barbarians was preserved, and their</a>
<a id='line_1523'>      zeal was inflamed: they discharged, with devout fury, the office</a>
<a id='line_1524'>      of spies, informers, or executioners; and whenever their cavalry</a>
<a id='line_1525'>      took the field, it was the favorite amusement of the march to</a>
<a id='line_1526'>      defile the churches, and to insult the clergy of the adverse</a>
<a id='line_1527'>      faction. 100 IV. The citizens who had been educated in the luxury</a>
<a id='line_1528'>      of the Roman province, were delivered, with exquisite cruelty, to</a>
<a id='line_1529'>      the Moors of the desert. A venerable train of bishops,</a>
<a id='line_1530'>      presbyters, and deacons, with a faithful crowd of four thousand</a>
<a id='line_1531'>      and ninety-six persons, whose guilt is not precisely ascertained,</a>
<a id='line_1532'>      were torn from their native homes, by the command of Hunneric.</a>
<a id='line_1533'>      During the night they were confined, like a herd of cattle,</a>
<a id='line_1534'>      amidst their own ordure: during the day they pursued their march</a>
<a id='line_1535'>      over the burning sands; and if they fainted under the heat and</a>
<a id='line_1536'>      fatigue, they were goaded, or dragged along, till they expired in</a>
<a id='line_1537'>      the hands of their tormentors. 101 These unhappy exiles, when</a>
<a id='line_1538'>      they reached the Moorish huts, might excite the compassion of a</a>
<a id='line_1539'>      people, whose native humanity was neither improved by reason, nor</a>
<a id='line_1540'>      corrupted by fanaticism: but if they escaped the dangers, they</a>
<a id='line_1541'>      were condemned to share the distress of a savage life. V. It is</a>
<a id='line_1542'>      incumbent on the authors of persecution previously to reflect,</a>
<a id='line_1543'>      whether they are determined to support it in the last extreme.</a>
<a id='line_1544'>      They excite the flame which they strive to extinguish; and it</a>
<a id='line_1545'>      soon becomes necessary to chastise the contumacy, as well as the</a>
<a id='line_1546'>      crime, of the offender. The fine, which he is unable or unwilling</a>
<a id='line_1547'>      to discharge, exposes his person to the severity of the law; and</a>
<a id='line_1548'>      his contempt of lighter penalties suggests the use and propriety</a>
<a id='line_1549'>      of capital punishment. Through the veil of fiction and</a>
<a id='line_1550'>      declamation we may clearly perceive, that the Catholics more</a>
<a id='line_1551'>      especially under the reign of Hunneric, endured the most cruel</a>
<a id='line_1552'>      and ignominious treatment. 102 Respectable citizens, noble</a>
<a id='line_1553'>      matrons, and consecrated virgins, were stripped naked, and raised</a>
<a id='line_1554'>      in the air by pulleys, with a weight suspended at their feet. In</a>
<a id='line_1555'>      this painful attitude their naked bodies were torn with scourges,</a>
<a id='line_1556'>      or burnt in the most tender parts with red-hot plates of iron.</a>
<a id='line_1557'>      The amputation of the ears the nose, the tongue, and the right</a>
<a id='line_1558'>      hand, was inflicted by the Arians; and although the precise</a>
<a id='line_1559'>      number cannot be defined, it is evident that many persons, among</a>
<a id='line_1560'>      whom a bishop 103 and a proconsul 104 may be named, were entitled</a>
<a id='line_1561'>      to the crown of martyrdom. The same honor has been ascribed to</a>
<a id='line_1562'>      the memory of Count Sebastian, who professed the Nicene creed</a>
<a id='line_1563'>      with unshaken constancy; and Genseric might detest, as a heretic,</a>
<a id='line_1564'>      the brave and ambitious fugitive whom he dreaded as a rival. 105</a>
<a id='line_1565'>      VI. A new mode of conversion, which might subdue the feeble, and</a>
<a id='line_1566'>      alarm the timorous, was employed by the Arian ministers. They</a>
<a id='line_1567'>      imposed, by fraud or violence, the rites of baptism; and punished</a>
<a id='line_1568'>      the apostasy of the Catholics, if they disclaimed this odious and</a>
<a id='line_1569'>      profane ceremony, which scandalously violated the freedom of the</a>
<a id='line_1570'>      will, and the unity of the sacrament. 106 The hostile sects had</a>
<a id='line_1571'>      formerly allowed the validity of each other’s baptism; and the</a>
<a id='line_1572'>      innovation, so fiercely maintained by the Vandals, can be imputed</a>
<a id='line_1573'>      only to the example and advice of the Donatists. VII. The Arian</a>
<a id='line_1574'>      clergy surpassed in religious cruelty the king and his Vandals;</a>
<a id='line_1575'>      but they were incapable of cultivating the spiritual vineyard,</a>
<a id='line_1576'>      which they were so desirous to possess. A patriarch 107 might</a>
<a id='line_1577'>      seat himself on the throne of Carthage; some bishops, in the</a>
<a id='line_1578'>      principal cities, might usurp the place of their rivals; but the</a>
<a id='line_1579'>      smallness of their numbers, and their ignorance of the Latin</a>
<a id='line_1580'>      language, 108 disqualified the Barbarians for the ecclesiastical</a>
<a id='line_1581'>      ministry of a great church; and the Africans, after the loss of</a>
<a id='line_1582'>      their orthodox pastors, were deprived of the public exercise of</a>
<a id='line_1583'>      Christianity. VIII. The emperors were the natural protectors of</a>
<a id='line_1584'>      the Homoousian doctrine; and the faithful people of Africa, both</a>
<a id='line_1585'>      as Romans and as Catholics, preferred their lawful sovereignty to</a>
<a id='line_1586'>      the usurpation of the Barbarous heretics. During an interval of</a>
<a id='line_1587'>      peace and friendship, Hunneric restored the cathedral of</a>
<a id='line_1588'>      Carthage; at the intercession of Zeno, who reigned in the East,</a>
<a id='line_1589'>      and of Placidia, the daughter and relict of emperors, and the</a>
<a id='line_1590'>      sister of the queen of the Vandals. 109 But this decent regard</a>
<a id='line_1591'>      was of short duration; and the haughty tyrant displayed his</a>
<a id='line_1592'>      contempt for the religion of the empire, by studiously arranging</a>
<a id='line_1593'>      the bloody images of persecution, in all the principal streets</a>
<a id='line_1594'>      through which the Roman ambassador must pass in his way to the</a>
<a id='line_1595'>      palace. 110 An oath was required from the bishops, who were</a>
<a id='line_1596'>      assembled at Carthage, that they would support the succession of</a>
<a id='line_1597'>      his son Hilderic, and that they would renounce all foreign or</a>
<a id='line_1598'>      transmarine correspondence. This engagement, consistent, as it</a>
<a id='line_1599'>      should seem, with their moral and religious duties, was refused</a>
<a id='line_1600'>      by the more sagacious members 111 of the assembly. Their refusal,</a>
<a id='line_1601'>      faintly colored by the pretence that it is unlawful for a</a>
<a id='line_1602'>      Christian to swear, must provoke the suspicions of a jealous</a>

<a id='line_1934'>      the heir of the Gothic monarchy was initiated in the Nicene faith</a>

<a id='line_1937'>      duties of a son and a subject; and the Catholics of Spain,</a>
<a id='line_1938'>      although they could not complain of persecution, applauded his</a>
<a id='line_1939'>      pious rebellion against an heretical father. The civil war was</a>
<a id='line_1940'>      protracted by the long and obstinate sieges of Merida, Cordova,</a>
<a id='line_1941'>      and Seville, which had strenuously espoused the party of</a>
<a id='line_1942'>      Hermenegild. He invited the orthodox Barbarians, the Seuvi, and</a>
<a id='line_1943'>      the Franks, to the destruction of his native land; he solicited</a>
<a id='line_1944'>      the dangerous aid of the Romans, who possessed Africa, and a part</a>
<a id='line_1945'>      of the Spanish coast; and his holy ambassador, the archbishop</a>
<a id='line_1946'>      Leander, effectually negotiated in person with the Byzantine</a>

<a id='line_1948'>      diligence of the monarch who commanded the troops and treasures</a>

<a id='line_1950'>      resist or to escape, was compelled to surrender himself into the</a>
<a id='line_1951'>      hands of an incensed father. Leovigild was still mindful of that</a>
<a id='line_1952'>      sacred character; and the rebel, despoiled of the regal</a>
<a id='line_1953'>      ornaments, was still permitted, in a decent exile, to profess the</a>

<a id='line_2006'>      Visigoths resisted, almost alone, the consent of the Christian</a>

<a id='line_2105'>      Hadrian, was filled with their numerous colonies. 138 The wealth</a>
<a id='line_2106'>      which they accumulated by trade, and the management of the</a>

<a id='line_2109'>      even the remembrance, of arms. Sisebut, a Gothic king, who</a>

<a id='line_2111'>      once to the last extremes of persecution. 139 Ninety thousand</a>
<a id='line_2112'>      Jews were compelled to receive the sacrament of baptism; the</a>
<a id='line_2113'>      fortunes of the obstinate infidels were confiscated, their bodies</a>
<a id='line_2114'>      were tortured; and it seems doubtful whether they were permitted</a>
<a id='line_2115'>      to abandon their native country. The excessive zeal of the</a>
<a id='line_2116'>      Catholic king was moderated, even by the clergy of Spain, who</a>
<a id='line_2117'>      solemnly pronounced an inconsistent sentence: that the sacraments</a>
<a id='line_2118'>      should not be forcibly imposed; but that the Jews who had been</a>
<a id='line_2119'>      baptized should be constrained, for the honor of the church, to</a>
<a id='line_2120'>      persevere in the external practice of a religion which they</a>
<a id='line_2121'>      disbelieved and detested. Their frequent relapses provoked one of</a>
<a id='line_2122'>      the successors of Sisebut to banish the whole nation from his</a>
<a id='line_2123'>      dominions; and a council of Toledo published a decree, that every</a>

<a id='line_2125'>      tyrants were unwilling to dismiss the victims, whom they</a>
<a id='line_2126'>      delighted to torture, or to deprive themselves of the industrious</a>
