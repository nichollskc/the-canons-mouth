<a id='line_9'></a>
<a id='line_10'></a>
<a id='line_11'>      In a style less grave than that of history, I should perhaps</a>
<a id='line_12'>      compare the emperor Alexius 1 to the jackal, who is said to</a>
<a id='line_13'>      follow the steps, and to devour the leavings, of the lion.</a>
<a id='line_14'>      Whatever had been his fears and toils in the passage of the first</a>
<a id='line_15'>      crusade, they were amply recompensed by the subsequent benefits</a>
<a id='line_16'>      which he derived from the exploits of the Franks. His dexterity</a>
<a id='line_17'>      and vigilance secured their first conquest of Nice; and from this</a>
<a id='line_18'>      threatening station the Turks were compelled to evacuate the</a>
<a id='line_19'>      neighborhood of Constantinople. While the crusaders, with blind</a>
<a id='line_20'>      valor, advanced into the midland countries of Asia, the crafty</a>
<a id='line_21'>      Greek improved the favorable occasion when the emirs of the</a>
<a id='line_22'>      sea-coast were recalled to the standard of the sultan. The Turks</a>
<a id='line_23'>      were driven from the Isles of Rhodes and Chios: the cities of</a>
<a id='line_24'>      Ephesus and Smyrna, of Sardes, Philadelphia, and Laodicea, were</a>
<a id='line_25'>      restored to the empire, which Alexius enlarged from the</a>
<a id='line_26'>      Hellespont to the banks of the Mæander, and the rocky shores of</a>
<a id='line_27'>      Pamphylia. The churches resumed their splendor: the towns were</a>
<a id='line_28'>      rebuilt and fortified; and the desert country was peopled with</a>
<a id='line_29'>      colonies of Christians, who were gently removed from the more</a>
<a id='line_30'>      distant and dangerous frontier. In these paternal cares, we may</a>
<a id='line_31'>      forgive Alexius, if he forgot the deliverance of the holy</a>
<a id='line_32'>      sepulchre; but, by the Latins, he was stigmatized with the foul</a>
<a id='line_33'>      reproach of treason and desertion. They had sworn fidelity and</a>
<a id='line_34'>      obedience to his throne; but _he_ had promised to assist their</a>
<a id='line_35'>      enterprise in person, or, at least, with his troops and</a>
<a id='line_36'>      treasures: his base retreat dissolved their obligations; and the</a>
<a id='line_37'>      sword, which had been the instrument of their victory, was the</a>
<a id='line_38'>      pledge and title of their just independence. It does not appear</a>
<a id='line_39'>      that the emperor attempted to revive his obsolete claims over the</a>
<a id='line_40'>      kingdom of Jerusalem; 2 but the borders of Cilicia and Syria were</a>
<a id='line_41'>      more recent in his possession, and more accessible to his arms.</a>
<a id='line_42'>      The great army of the crusaders was annihilated or dispersed; the</a>
<a id='line_43'>      principality of Antioch was left without a head, by the surprise</a>
<a id='line_44'>      and captivity of Bohemond; his ransom had oppressed him with a</a>
<a id='line_45'>      heavy debt; and his Norman followers were insufficient to repel</a>
<a id='line_46'>      the hostilities of the Greeks and Turks. In this distress,</a>
<a id='line_47'>      Bohemond embraced a magnanimous resolution, of leaving the</a>
<a id='line_48'>      defence of Antioch to his kinsman, the faithful Tancred; of</a>
<a id='line_49'>      arming the West against the Byzantine empire; and of executing</a>
<a id='line_50'>      the design which he inherited from the lessons and example of his</a>
<a id='line_51'>      father Guiscard. His embarkation was clandestine: and, if we may</a>
<a id='line_52'>      credit a tale of the princess Anne, he passed the hostile sea</a>
<a id='line_53'>      closely secreted in a coffin. 3 But his reception in France was</a>
<a id='line_54'>      dignified by the public applause, and his marriage with the</a>
<a id='line_55'>      king’s daughter: his return was glorious, since the bravest</a>
<a id='line_56'>      spirits of the age enlisted under his veteran command; and he</a>
<a id='line_57'>      repassed the Adriatic at the head of five thousand horse and</a>
<a id='line_58'>      forty thousand foot, assembled from the most remote climates of</a>
<a id='line_59'>      Europe. 4 The strength of Durazzo, and prudence of Alexius, the</a>
<a id='line_60'>      progress of famine and approach of winter, eluded his ambitious</a>
<a id='line_61'>      hopes; and the venal confederates were seduced from his standard.</a>
<a id='line_62'>      A treaty of peace 5 suspended the fears of the Greeks; and they</a>
<a id='line_63'>      were finally delivered by the death of an adversary, whom neither</a>
<a id='line_64'>      oaths could bind, nor dangers could appal, nor prosperity could</a>
<a id='line_65'>      satiate. His children succeeded to the principality of Antioch;</a>
<a id='line_66'>      but the boundaries were strictly defined, the homage was clearly</a>
<a id='line_67'>      stipulated, and the cities of Tarsus and Malmistra were restored</a>
<a id='line_68'>      to the Byzantine emperors. Of the coast of Anatolia, they</a>
<a id='line_69'>      possessed the entire circuit from Trebizond to the Syrian gates.</a>
<a id='line_70'>      The Seljukian dynasty of Roum 6 was separated on all sides from</a>
<a id='line_71'>      the sea and their Mussulman brethren; the power of the sultan was</a>
<a id='line_72'>      shaken by the victories and even the defeats of the Franks; and</a>
<a id='line_73'>      after the loss of Nice, they removed their throne to Cogni or</a>
<a id='line_74'>      Iconium, an obscure and in land town above three hundred miles</a>
<a id='line_75'>      from Constantinople. 7 Instead of trembling for their capital,</a>
<a id='line_76'>      the Comnenian princes waged an offensive war against the Turks,</a>
<a id='line_77'>      and the first crusade prevented the fall of the declining empire.</a>

<a id='line_126'>      In the twelfth century, three great emigrations marched by land</a>
<a id='line_127'>      from the West for the relief of Palestine. The soldiers and</a>
<a id='line_128'>      pilgrims of Lombardy, France, and Germany were excited by the</a>

<a id='line_133'>      9 A grand division of the third crusade was led by the emperor</a>
<a id='line_134'>      Frederic Barbarossa, 10 who sympathized with his brothers of</a>

<a id='line_164'>      I. Of the swarms that so closely trod in the footsteps of the</a>

<a id='line_166'>      fame and merit, to Godfrey of Bouillon and his</a>
<a id='line_167'>      fellow-adventurers. At their head were displayed the banners of</a>
<a id='line_168'>      the dukes of Burgundy, Bavaria, and Aquitain; the first a</a>
<a id='line_169'>      descendant of Hugh Capet, the second, a father of the Brunswick</a>

<a id='line_172'>      church and palace; and the veteran crusaders, Hugh the Great and</a>
<a id='line_173'>      Stephen of Chartres, returned to consummate their unfinished vow.</a>
<a id='line_174'>      The huge and disorderly bodies of their followers moved forward</a>
<a id='line_175'>      in two columns; and if the first consisted of two hundred and</a>
<a id='line_176'>      sixty thousand persons, the second might possibly amount to sixty</a>
<a id='line_177'>      thousand horse and one hundred thousand foot. 11 111 The armies</a>
<a id='line_178'>      of the second crusade might have claimed the conquest of Asia;</a>
<a id='line_179'>      the nobles of France and Germany were animated by the presence of</a>
<a id='line_180'>      their sovereigns; and both the rank and personal character of</a>
<a id='line_181'>      Conrad and Louis gave a dignity to their cause, and a discipline</a>
<a id='line_182'>      to their force, which might be vainly expected from the feudatory</a>
<a id='line_183'>      chiefs. The cavalry of the emperor, and that of the king, was</a>
<a id='line_184'>      each composed of seventy thousand knights, and their immediate</a>
<a id='line_185'>      attendants in the field; 12 and if the light-armed troops, the</a>
<a id='line_186'>      peasant infantry, the women and children, the priests and monks,</a>
<a id='line_187'>      be rigorously excluded, the full account will scarcely be</a>
<a id='line_188'>      satisfied with four hundred thousand souls. The West, from Rome</a>
<a id='line_189'>      to Britain, was called into action; the kings of Poland and</a>
<a id='line_190'>      Bohemia obeyed the summons of Conrad; and it is affirmed by the</a>
<a id='line_191'>      Greeks and Latins, that, in the passage of a strait or river, the</a>
<a id='line_192'>      Byzantine agents, after a tale of nine hundred thousand, desisted</a>
<a id='line_193'>      from the endless and formidable computation. 13 In the third</a>
<a id='line_194'>      crusade, as the French and English preferred the navigation of</a>
<a id='line_195'>      the Mediterranean, the host of Frederic Barbarossa was less</a>
<a id='line_196'>      numerous. Fifteen thousand knights, and as many squires, were the</a>
<a id='line_197'>      flower of the German chivalry: sixty thousand horse, and one</a>
<a id='line_198'>      hundred thousand foot, were mustered by the emperor in the plains</a>
<a id='line_199'>      of Hungary; and after such repetitions, we shall no longer be</a>
<a id='line_200'>      startled at the six hundred thousand pilgrims, which credulity</a>
<a id='line_201'>      has ascribed to this last emigration. 14 Such extravagant</a>
<a id='line_202'>      reckonings prove only the astonishment of contemporaries; but</a>
<a id='line_203'>      their astonishment most strongly bears testimony to the existence</a>
<a id='line_204'>      of an enormous, though indefinite, multitude. The Greeks might</a>
<a id='line_205'>      applaud their superior knowledge of the arts and stratagems of</a>
<a id='line_206'>      war, but they confessed the strength and courage of the French</a>
<a id='line_207'>      cavalry, and the infantry of the Germans; 15 and the strangers</a>
<a id='line_208'>      are described as an iron race, of gigantic stature, who darted</a>
<a id='line_209'>      fire from their eyes, and spilt blood like water on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_210'>      Under the banners of Conrad, a troop of females rode in the</a>

<a id='line_255'>      terror to the effeminate Greeks, and the sentiment of fear is</a>
<a id='line_256'>      nearly allied to that of hatred. This aversion was suspended or</a>
<a id='line_257'>      softened by the apprehension of the Turkish power; and the</a>
<a id='line_258'>      invectives of the Latins will not bias our more candid belief,</a>
<a id='line_259'>      that the emperor Alexius dissembled their insolence, eluded their</a>
<a id='line_260'>      hostilities, counselled their rashness, and opened to their ardor</a>
<a id='line_261'>      the road of pilgrimage and conquest. But when the Turks had been</a>
<a id='line_262'>      driven from Nice and the sea-coast, when the Byzantine princes no</a>
<a id='line_263'>      longer dreaded the distant sultans of Cogni, they felt with purer</a>
<a id='line_264'>      indignation the free and frequent passage of the western</a>
<a id='line_265'>      Barbarians, who violated the majesty, and endangered the safety,</a>
<a id='line_266'>      of the empire. The second and third crusades were undertaken</a>
<a id='line_267'>      under the reign of Manuel Comnenus and Isaac Angelus. Of the</a>
<a id='line_268'>      former, the passions were always impetuous, and often malevolent;</a>
<a id='line_269'>      and the natural union of a cowardly and a mischievous temper was</a>
<a id='line_270'>      exemplified in the latter, who, without merit or mercy, could</a>
<a id='line_271'>      punish a tyrant, and occupy his throne. It was secretly, and</a>
<a id='line_272'>      perhaps tacitly, resolved by the prince and people to destroy, or</a>
<a id='line_273'>      at least to discourage, the pilgrims, by every species of injury</a>
<a id='line_274'>      and oppression; and their want of prudence and discipline</a>
<a id='line_275'>      continually afforded the pretence or the opportunity. The Western</a>
<a id='line_276'>      monarchs had stipulated a safe passage and fair market in the</a>
<a id='line_277'>      country of their Christian brethren; the treaty had been ratified</a>
<a id='line_278'>      by oaths and hostages; and the poorest soldier of Frederic’s army</a>
<a id='line_279'>      was furnished with three marks of silver to defray his expenses</a>
<a id='line_280'>      on the road. But every engagement was violated by treachery and</a>
<a id='line_281'>      injustice; and the complaints of the Latins are attested by the</a>
<a id='line_282'>      honest confession of a Greek historian, who has dared to prefer</a>
<a id='line_283'>      truth to his country. 16 Instead of a hospitable reception, the</a>
<a id='line_284'>      gates of the cities, both in Europe and Asia, were closely barred</a>
<a id='line_285'>      against the crusaders; and the scanty pittance of food was let</a>
<a id='line_286'>      down in baskets from the walls. Experience or foresight might</a>
<a id='line_287'>      excuse this timid jealousy; but the common duties of humanity</a>
<a id='line_288'>      prohibited the mixture of chalk, or other poisonous ingredients,</a>
<a id='line_289'>      in the bread; and should Manuel be acquitted of any foul</a>
<a id='line_290'>      connivance, he is guilty of coining base money for the purpose of</a>
<a id='line_291'>      trading with the pilgrims. In every step of their march they were</a>
<a id='line_292'>      stopped or misled: the governors had private orders to fortify</a>
<a id='line_293'>      the passes and break down the bridges against them: the</a>
<a id='line_294'>      stragglers were pillaged and murdered: the soldiers and horses</a>
<a id='line_295'>      were pierced in the woods by arrows from an invisible hand; the</a>
<a id='line_296'>      sick were burnt in their beds; and the dead bodies were hung on</a>
<a id='line_297'>      gibbets along the highways. These injuries exasperated the</a>
<a id='line_298'>      champions of the cross, who were not endowed with evangelical</a>
<a id='line_299'>      patience; and the Byzantine princes, who had provoked the unequal</a>
<a id='line_300'>      conflict, promoted the embarkation and march of these formidable</a>
<a id='line_301'>      guests. On the verge of the Turkish frontier Barbarossa spared</a>
<a id='line_302'>      the guilty Philadelphia, 17 rewarded the hospitable Laodicea, and</a>
<a id='line_303'>      deplored the hard necessity that had stained his sword with any</a>
<a id='line_304'>      drops of Christian blood. In their intercourse with the monarchs</a>
<a id='line_305'>      of Germany and France, the pride of the Greeks was exposed to an</a>
<a id='line_306'>      anxious trial. They might boast that on the first interview the</a>
<a id='line_307'>      seat of Louis was a low stool, beside the throne of Manuel; 18</a>
<a id='line_308'>      but no sooner had the French king transported his army beyond the</a>
<a id='line_309'>      Bosphorus, than he refused the offer of a second conference,</a>
<a id='line_310'>      unless his brother would meet him on equal terms, either on the</a>
<a id='line_311'>      sea or land. With Conrad and Frederic, the ceremonial was still</a>
<a id='line_312'>      nicer and more difficult: like the successors of Constantine,</a>
<a id='line_313'>      they styled themselves emperors of the Romans; 19 and firmly</a>
<a id='line_314'>      maintained the purity of their title and dignity. The first of</a>
<a id='line_315'>      these representatives of Charlemagne would only converse with</a>
<a id='line_316'>      Manuel on horseback in the open field; the second, by passing the</a>
<a id='line_317'>      Hellespont rather than the Bosphorus, declined the view of</a>
<a id='line_318'>      Constantinople and its sovereign. An emperor, who had been</a>
<a id='line_319'>      crowned at Rome, was reduced in the Greek epistles to the humble</a>
<a id='line_320'>      appellation of _Rex_, or prince, of the Alemanni; and the vain</a>
<a id='line_321'>      and feeble Angelus affected to be ignorant of the name of one of</a>
<a id='line_322'>      the greatest men and monarchs of the age. While they viewed with</a>
<a id='line_323'>      hatred and suspicion the Latin pilgrims the Greek emperors</a>
<a id='line_324'>      maintained a strict, though secret, alliance with the Turks and</a>
<a id='line_325'>      Saracens. Isaac Angelus complained, that by his friendship for</a>
<a id='line_326'>      the great Saladin he had incurred the enmity of the Franks; and a</a>
<a id='line_327'>      mosque was founded at Constantinople for the public exercise of</a>

<a id='line_367'>      own subjects of giving seasonable intelligence to the sultan, and</a>

<a id='line_369'>      common foe, by a double attack at the same time but on different</a>
<a id='line_370'>      sides, the Germans were urged by emulation, and the French were</a>
<a id='line_371'>      retarded by jealousy. Louis had scarcely passed the Bosphorus</a>
<a id='line_372'>      when he was met by the returning emperor, who had lost the</a>
<a id='line_373'>      greater part of his army in glorious, but unsuccessful, actions</a>
<a id='line_374'>      on the banks of the Mæander. The contrast of the pomp of his</a>
<a id='line_375'>      rival hastened the retreat of Conrad: 202 the desertion of his</a>
<a id='line_376'>      independent vassals reduced him to his hereditary troops; and he</a>
<a id='line_377'>      borrowed some Greek vessels to execute by sea the pilgrimage of</a>
<a id='line_378'>      Palestine. Without studying the lessons of experience, or the</a>
<a id='line_379'>      nature of the war, the king of France advanced through the same</a>
<a id='line_380'>      country to a similar fate. The vanguard, which bore the royal</a>
<a id='line_381'>      banner and the oriflamme of St. Denys, 21 had doubled their march</a>
<a id='line_382'>      with rash and inconsiderate speed; and the rear, which the king</a>
<a id='line_383'>      commanded in person, no longer found their companions in the</a>
<a id='line_384'>      evening camp. In darkness and disorder, they were encompassed,</a>
<a id='line_385'>      assaulted, and overwhelmed, by the innumerable host of Turks,</a>
<a id='line_386'>      who, in the art of war, were superior to the Christians of the</a>
<a id='line_387'>      twelfth century. 211 Louis, who climbed a tree in the general</a>
<a id='line_388'>      discomfiture, was saved by his own valor and the ignorance of his</a>
<a id='line_389'>      adversaries; and with the dawn of day he escaped alive, but</a>
<a id='line_390'>      almost alone, to the camp of the vanguard. But instead of</a>
<a id='line_391'>      pursuing his expedition by land, he was rejoiced to shelter the</a>
<a id='line_392'>      relics of his army in the friendly seaport of Satalia. From</a>
<a id='line_393'>      thence he embarked for Antioch; but so penurious was the supply</a>
<a id='line_394'>      of Greek vessels, that they could only afford room for his</a>
<a id='line_395'>      knights and nobles; and the plebeian crowd of infantry was left</a>
<a id='line_396'>      to perish at the foot of the Pamphylian hills. The emperor and</a>
<a id='line_397'>      the king embraced and wept at Jerusalem; their martial trains,</a>
<a id='line_398'>      the remnant of mighty armies, were joined to the Christian powers</a>
<a id='line_399'>      of Syria, and a fruitless siege of Damascus was the final effort</a>
<a id='line_400'>      of the second crusade. Conrad and Louis embarked for Europe with</a>
<a id='line_401'>      the personal fame of piety and courage; but the Orientals had</a>
<a id='line_402'>      braved these potent monarchs of the Franks, with whose names and</a>
<a id='line_403'>      military forces they had been so often threatened. 22 Perhaps</a>
<a id='line_404'>      they had still more to fear from the veteran genius of Frederic</a>
<a id='line_405'>      the First, who in his youth had served in Asia under his uncle</a>
<a id='line_406'>      Conrad. Forty campaigns in Germany and Italy had taught</a>
<a id='line_407'>      Barbarossa to command; and his soldiers, even the princes of the</a>
<a id='line_408'>      empire, were accustomed under his reign to obey. As soon as he</a>
<a id='line_409'>      lost sight of Philadelphia and Laodicea, the last cities of the</a>
<a id='line_410'>      Greek frontier, he plunged into the salt and barren desert, a</a>
<a id='line_411'>      land (says the historian) of horror and tribulation. 23 During</a>
<a id='line_412'>      twenty days, every step of his fainting and sickly march was</a>
<a id='line_413'>      besieged by the innumerable hordes of Turkmans, 24 whose numbers</a>
<a id='line_414'>      and fury seemed after each defeat to multiply and inflame. The</a>
<a id='line_415'>      emperor continued to struggle and to suffer; and such was the</a>
<a id='line_416'>      measure of his calamities, that when he reached the gates of</a>
<a id='line_417'>      Iconium, no more than one thousand knights were able to serve on</a>
<a id='line_418'>      horseback. By a sudden and resolute assault he defeated the</a>
<a id='line_419'>      guards, and stormed the capital of the sultan, 25 who humbly sued</a>
<a id='line_420'>      for pardon and peace. The road was now open, and Frederic</a>
<a id='line_421'>      advanced in a career of triumph, till he was unfortunately</a>
<a id='line_422'>      drowned in a petty torrent of Cilicia. 26 The remainder of his</a>
<a id='line_423'>      Germans was consumed by sickness and desertion: and the emperor’s</a>
<a id='line_424'>      son expired with the greatest part of his Swabian vassals at the</a>
<a id='line_425'>      siege of Acre. Among the Latin heroes, Godfrey of Bouillon and</a>
<a id='line_426'>      Frederic Barbarossa could alone achieve the passage of the Lesser</a>
<a id='line_427'>      Asia; yet even their success was a warning; and in the last and</a>
<a id='line_428'>      most experienced age of the crusades, every nation preferred the</a>

<a id='line_497'>      event, while hope was fresh, danger untried, and enterprise</a>
<a id='line_498'>      congenial to the spirit of the times. But the obstinate</a>
<a id='line_499'>      perseverance of Europe may indeed excite our pity and admiration;</a>
<a id='line_500'>      that no instruction should have been drawn from constant and</a>
<a id='line_501'>      adverse experience; that the same confidence should have</a>
<a id='line_502'>      repeatedly grown from the same failures; that six succeeding</a>
<a id='line_503'>      generations should have rushed headlong down the precipice that</a>
<a id='line_504'>      was open before them; and that men of every condition should have</a>
<a id='line_505'>      staked their public and private fortunes on the desperate</a>
<a id='line_506'>      adventure of possessing or recovering a tombstone two thousand</a>
<a id='line_507'>      miles from their country. In a period of two centuries after the</a>
<a id='line_508'>      council of Clermont, each spring and summer produced a new</a>
<a id='line_509'>      emigration of pilgrim warriors for the defence of the Holy Land;</a>
<a id='line_510'>      but the seven great armaments or crusades were excited by some</a>
<a id='line_511'>      impending or recent calamity: the nations were moved by the</a>
<a id='line_512'>      authority of their pontiffs, and the example of their kings:</a>
<a id='line_513'>      their zeal was kindled, and their reason was silenced, by the</a>
<a id='line_514'>      voice of their holy orators; and among these, Bernard, 28 the</a>
<a id='line_515'>      monk, or the saint, may claim the most honorable place. 281 About</a>
<a id='line_516'>      eight years before the first conquest of Jerusalem, he was born</a>
<a id='line_517'>      of a noble family in Burgundy; at the age of three-and-twenty he</a>
<a id='line_518'>      buried himself in the monastery of Citeaux, then in the primitive</a>
<a id='line_519'>      fervor of the institution; at the end of two years he led forth</a>
<a id='line_520'>      her third colony, or daughter, to the valley of Clairvaux 29 in</a>
<a id='line_521'>      Champagne; and was content, till the hour of his death, with the</a>
<a id='line_522'>      humble station of abbot of his own community. A philosophic age</a>
<a id='line_523'>      has abolished, with too liberal and indiscriminate disdain, the</a>
<a id='line_524'>      honors of these spiritual heroes. The meanest among them are</a>
<a id='line_525'>      distinguished by some energies of the mind; they were at least</a>
<a id='line_526'>      superior to their votaries and disciples; and, in the race of</a>
<a id='line_527'>      superstition, they attained the prize for which such numbers</a>
<a id='line_528'>      contended. In speech, in writing, in action, Bernard stood high</a>
<a id='line_529'>      above his rivals and contemporaries; his compositions are not</a>
<a id='line_530'>      devoid of wit and eloquence; and he seems to have preserved as</a>
<a id='line_531'>      much reason and humanity as may be reconciled with the character</a>
<a id='line_532'>      of a saint. In a secular life, he would have shared the seventh</a>
<a id='line_533'>      part of a private inheritance; by a vow of poverty and penance,</a>
<a id='line_534'>      by closing his eyes against the visible world, 30 by the refusal</a>
<a id='line_535'>      of all ecclesiastical dignities, the abbot of Clairvaux became</a>
<a id='line_536'>      the oracle of Europe, and the founder of one hundred and sixty</a>
<a id='line_537'>      convents. Princes and pontiffs trembled at the freedom of his</a>
<a id='line_538'>      apostolical censures: France, England, and Milan, consulted and</a>
<a id='line_539'>      obeyed his judgment in a schism of the church: the debt was</a>
<a id='line_540'>      repaid by the gratitude of Innocent the Second; and his</a>
<a id='line_541'>      successor, Eugenius the Third, was the friend and disciple of the</a>
<a id='line_542'>      holy Bernard. It was in the proclamation of the second crusade</a>
<a id='line_543'>      that he shone as the missionary and prophet of God, who called</a>
<a id='line_544'>      the nations to the defence of his holy sepulchre. 31 At the</a>
<a id='line_545'>      parliament of Vezelay he spoke before the king; and Louis the</a>
<a id='line_546'>      Seventh, with his nobles, received their crosses from his hand.</a>
<a id='line_547'>      The abbot of Clairvaux then marched to the less easy conquest of</a>
<a id='line_548'>      the emperor Conrad: 311 a phlegmatic people, ignorant of his</a>
<a id='line_549'>      language, was transported by the pathetic vehemence of his tone</a>
<a id='line_550'>      and gestures; and his progress, from Constance to Cologne, was</a>
<a id='line_551'>      the triumph of eloquence and zeal. Bernard applauds his own</a>
<a id='line_552'>      success in the depopulation of Europe; affirms that cities and</a>
<a id='line_553'>      castles were emptied of their inhabitants; and computes, that</a>
<a id='line_554'>      only one man was left behind for the consolation of seven widows.</a>
<a id='line_555'>      32 The blind fanatics were desirous of electing him for their</a>
<a id='line_556'>      general; but the example of the hermit Peter was before his eyes;</a>
<a id='line_557'>      and while he assured the crusaders of the divine favor, he</a>
<a id='line_558'>      prudently declined a military command, in which failure and</a>
<a id='line_559'>      victory would have been almost equally disgraceful to his</a>
<a id='line_560'>      character. 33 Yet, after the calamitous event, the abbot of</a>
<a id='line_561'>      Clairvaux was loudly accused as a false prophet, the author of</a>
<a id='line_562'>      the public and private mourning; his enemies exulted, his friends</a>
<a id='line_563'>      blushed, and his apology was slow and unsatisfactory. He</a>
<a id='line_564'>      justifies his obedience to the commands of the pope; expatiates</a>
<a id='line_565'>      on the mysterious ways of Providence; imputes the misfortunes of</a>
<a id='line_566'>      the pilgrims to their own sins; and modestly insinuates, that his</a>
<a id='line_567'>      mission had been approved by signs and wonders. 34 Had the fact</a>
<a id='line_568'>      been certain, the argument would be decisive; and his faithful</a>
<a id='line_569'>      disciples, who enumerate twenty or thirty miracles in a day,</a>
<a id='line_570'>      appeal to the public assemblies of France and Germany, in which</a>
<a id='line_571'>      they were performed. 35 At the present hour, such prodigies will</a>

<a id='line_650'>      fugitives diffused their consternation and sorrow; Bagdad mourned</a>

<a id='line_655'>      some temporal power was restored to the last age of the</a>
<a id='line_656'>      Abbassides; but their humble ambition was confined to Bagdad and</a>
<a id='line_657'>      the adjacent province. Their tyrants, the Seljukian sultans, had</a>
<a id='line_658'>      followed the common law of the Asiatic dynasties, the unceasing</a>
<a id='line_659'>      round of valor, greatness, discord, degeneracy, and decay; their</a>
<a id='line_660'>      spirit and power were unequal to the defence of religion; and, in</a>
<a id='line_661'>      his distant realm of Persia, the Christians were strangers to the</a>
<a id='line_662'>      name and the arms of Sangiar, the last hero of his race. 37 While</a>
<a id='line_663'>      the sultans were involved in the silken web of the harem, the</a>
<a id='line_664'>      pious task was undertaken by their slaves, the Atabeks, 38 a</a>
<a id='line_665'>      Turkish name, which, like the Byzantine patricians, may be</a>

<a id='line_668'>      privilege of standing on the right hand of the throne; but, in</a>
<a id='line_669'>      the civil wars that ensued on the monarch’s death, he lost his</a>
<a id='line_670'>      head and the government of Aleppo. His domestic emirs persevered</a>
<a id='line_671'>      in their attachment to his son Zenghi, who proved his first arms</a>
<a id='line_672'>      against the Franks in the defeat of Antioch: thirty campaigns in</a>
<a id='line_673'>      the service of the caliph and sultan established his military</a>
<a id='line_674'>      fame; and he was invested with the command of Mosul, as the only</a>
<a id='line_675'>      champion that could avenge the cause of the prophet. The public</a>
<a id='line_676'>      hope was not disappointed: after a siege of twenty-five days, he</a>
<a id='line_677'>      stormed the city of Edessa, and recovered from the Franks their</a>
<a id='line_678'>      conquests beyond the Euphrates: 39 the martial tribes of</a>
<a id='line_679'>      Curdistan were subdued by the independent sovereign of Mosul and</a>
<a id='line_680'>      Aleppo: his soldiers were taught to behold the camp as their only</a>
<a id='line_681'>      country; they trusted to his liberality for their rewards; and</a>
<a id='line_682'>      their absent families were protected by the vigilance of Zenghi.</a>
<a id='line_683'>      At the head of these veterans, his son Noureddin gradually united</a>
<a id='line_684'>      the Mahometan powers; 391 added the kingdom of Damascus to that</a>
<a id='line_685'>      of Aleppo, and waged a long and successful war against the</a>
<a id='line_686'>      Christians of Syria; he spread his ample reign from the Tigris to</a>
<a id='line_687'>      the Nile, and the Abbassides rewarded their faithful servant with</a>
<a id='line_688'>      all the titles and prerogatives of royalty. The Latins themselves</a>
<a id='line_689'>      were compelled to own the wisdom and courage, and even the</a>
<a id='line_690'>      justice and piety, of this implacable adversary. 40 In his life</a>
<a id='line_691'>      and government the holy warrior revived the zeal and simplicity</a>
<a id='line_692'>      of the first caliphs. Gold and silk were banished from his</a>
<a id='line_693'>      palace; the use of wine from his dominions; the public revenue</a>
<a id='line_694'>      was scrupulously applied to the public service; and the frugal</a>
<a id='line_695'>      household of Noureddin was maintained from his legitimate share</a>
<a id='line_696'>      of the spoil which he vested in the purchase of a private estate.</a>
<a id='line_697'>      His favorite sultana sighed for some female object of expense.</a>

<a id='line_751'>      Chapter LIX: The Crusades.—Part II.</a>
<a id='line_752'></a>
<a id='line_753'>      By the arms of the Turks and Franks, the Fatimites had been</a>
<a id='line_754'>      deprived of Syria. In Egypt the decay of their character and</a>
<a id='line_755'>      influence was still more essential. Yet they were still revered</a>
<a id='line_756'>      as the descendants and successors of the prophet; they maintained</a>
<a id='line_757'>      their invisible state in the palace of Cairo; and their person</a>
<a id='line_758'>      was seldom violated by the profane eyes of subjects or strangers.</a>
<a id='line_759'>      The Latin ambassadors 41 have described their own introduction,</a>
<a id='line_760'>      through a series of gloomy passages, and glittering porticos: the</a>
<a id='line_761'>      scene was enlivened by the warbling of birds and the murmur of</a>
<a id='line_762'>      fountains: it was enriched by a display of rich furniture and</a>
<a id='line_763'>      rare animals; of the Imperial treasures, something was shown, and</a>
<a id='line_764'>      much was supposed; and the long order of unfolding doors was</a>
<a id='line_765'>      guarded by black soldiers and domestic eunuchs. The sanctuary of</a>
<a id='line_766'>      the presence chamber was veiled with a curtain; and the vizier,</a>
<a id='line_767'>      who conducted the ambassadors, laid aside the cimeter, and</a>
<a id='line_768'>      prostrated himself three times on the ground; the veil was then</a>
<a id='line_769'>      removed; and they beheld the commander of the faithful, who</a>
<a id='line_770'>      signified his pleasure to the first slave of the throne. But this</a>
<a id='line_771'>      slave was his master: the viziers or sultans had usurped the</a>
<a id='line_772'>      supreme administration of Egypt; the claims of the rival</a>
<a id='line_773'>      candidates were decided by arms; and the name of the most worthy,</a>
<a id='line_774'>      of the strongest, was inserted in the royal patent of command.</a>
<a id='line_775'>      The factions of Dargham and Shawer alternately expelled each</a>
<a id='line_776'>      other from the capital and country; and the weaker side implored</a>
<a id='line_777'>      the dangerous protection of the sultan of Damascus, or the king</a>
<a id='line_778'>      of Jerusalem, the perpetual enemies of the sect and monarchy of</a>
<a id='line_779'>      the Fatimites. By his arms and religion the Turk was most</a>
<a id='line_780'>      formidable; but the Frank, in an easy, direct march, could</a>
<a id='line_781'>      advance from Gaza to the Nile; while the intermediate situation</a>
<a id='line_782'>      of his realm compelled the troops of Noureddin to wheel round the</a>
<a id='line_783'>      skirts of Arabia, a long and painful circuit, which exposed them</a>
<a id='line_784'>      to thirst, fatigue, and the burning winds of the desert. The</a>
<a id='line_785'>      secret zeal and ambition of the Turkish prince aspired to reign</a>
<a id='line_786'>      in Egypt under the name of the Abbassides; but the restoration of</a>
<a id='line_787'>      the suppliant Shawer was the ostensible motive of the first</a>
<a id='line_788'>      expedition; and the success was intrusted to the emir Shiracouh,</a>
<a id='line_789'>      a valiant and veteran commander. Dargham was oppressed and slain;</a>
<a id='line_790'>      but the ingratitude, the jealousy, the just apprehensions, of his</a>
<a id='line_791'>      more fortunate rival, soon provoked him to invite the king of</a>
<a id='line_792'>      Jerusalem to deliver Egypt from his insolent benefactors. To this</a>
<a id='line_793'>      union the forces of Shiracouh were unequal: he relinquished the</a>
<a id='line_794'>      premature conquest; and the evacuation of Belbeis or Pelusium was</a>
<a id='line_795'>      the condition of his safe retreat. As the Turks defiled before</a>
<a id='line_796'>      the enemy, and their general closed the rear, with a vigilant</a>
<a id='line_797'>      eye, and a battle axe in his hand, a Frank presumed to ask him if</a>
<a id='line_798'>      he were not afraid of an attack. “It is doubtless in your power</a>
<a id='line_799'>      to begin the attack,” replied the intrepid emir; “but rest</a>
<a id='line_800'>      assured, that not one of my soldiers will go to paradise till he</a>
<a id='line_801'>      has sent an infidel to hell.” His report of the riches of the</a>
<a id='line_802'>      land, the effeminacy of the natives, and the disorders of the</a>
<a id='line_803'>      government, revived the hopes of Noureddin; the caliph of Bagdad</a>
<a id='line_804'>      applauded the pious design; and Shiracouh descended into Egypt a</a>
<a id='line_805'>      second time with twelve thousand Turks and eleven thousand Arabs.</a>
<a id='line_806'>      Yet his forces were still inferior to the confederate armies of</a>
<a id='line_807'>      the Franks and Saracens; and I can discern an unusual degree of</a>
<a id='line_808'>      military art, in his passage of the Nile, his retreat into</a>
<a id='line_809'>      Thebais, his masterly evolutions in the battle of Babain, the</a>
<a id='line_810'>      surprise of Alexandria, and his marches and countermarches in the</a>
<a id='line_811'>      flats and valley of Egypt, from the tropic to the sea. His</a>
<a id='line_812'>      conduct was seconded by the courage of his troops, and on the eve</a>
<a id='line_813'>      of action a Mamaluke 42 exclaimed, “If we cannot wrest Egypt from</a>
<a id='line_814'>      the Christian dogs, why do we not renounce the honors and rewards</a>
<a id='line_815'>      of the sultan, and retire to labor with the peasants, or to spin</a>
<a id='line_816'>      with the females of the harem?” Yet, after all his efforts in the</a>
<a id='line_817'>      field, 43 after the obstinate defence of Alexandria 44 by his</a>
<a id='line_818'>      nephew Saladin, an honorable capitulation and retreat 441</a>
<a id='line_819'>      concluded the second enterprise of Shiracouh; and Noureddin</a>
<a id='line_820'>      reserved his abilities for a third and more propitious occasion.</a>
<a id='line_821'>      It was soon offered by the ambition and avarice of Amalric or</a>
<a id='line_822'>      Amaury, king of Jerusalem, who had imbibed the pernicious maxim,</a>
<a id='line_823'>      that no faith should be kept with the enemies of God. 442 A</a>
<a id='line_824'>      religious warrior, the great master of the hospital, encouraged</a>
<a id='line_825'>      him to proceed; the emperor of Constantinople either gave, or</a>
<a id='line_826'>      promised, a fleet to act with the armies of Syria; and the</a>
<a id='line_827'>      perfidious Christian, unsatisfied with spoil and subsidy, aspired</a>
<a id='line_828'>      to the conquest of Egypt. In this emergency, the Moslems turned</a>
<a id='line_829'>      their eyes towards the sultan of Damascus; the vizier, whom</a>
<a id='line_830'>      danger encompassed on all sides, yielded to their unanimous</a>
<a id='line_831'>      wishes, and Noureddin seemed to be tempted by the fair offer of</a>
<a id='line_832'>      one third of the revenue of the kingdom. The Franks were already</a>
<a id='line_833'>      at the gates of Cairo; but the suburbs, the old city, were burnt</a>
<a id='line_834'>      on their approach; they were deceived by an insidious</a>
<a id='line_835'>      negotiation, and their vessels were unable to surmount the</a>
<a id='line_836'>      barriers of the Nile. They prudently declined a contest with the</a>
<a id='line_837'>      Turks in the midst of a hostile country; and Amaury retired into</a>
<a id='line_838'>      Palestine with the shame and reproach that always adhere to</a>
<a id='line_839'>      unsuccessful injustice. After this deliverance, Shiracouh was</a>
<a id='line_840'>      invested with a robe of honor, which he soon stained with the</a>
<a id='line_841'>      blood of the unfortunate Shawer. For a while, the Turkish emirs</a>
<a id='line_842'>      condescended to hold the office of vizier; but this foreign</a>
<a id='line_843'>      conquest precipitated the fall of the Fatimites themselves; and</a>
<a id='line_844'>      the bloodless change was accomplished by a message and a word.</a>
<a id='line_845'>      The caliphs had been degraded by their own weakness and the</a>
<a id='line_846'>      tyranny of the viziers: their subjects blushed, when the</a>
<a id='line_847'>      descendant and successor of the prophet presented his naked hand</a>
<a id='line_848'>      to the rude gripe of a Latin ambassador; they wept when he sent</a>
<a id='line_849'>      the hair of his women, a sad emblem of their grief and terror, to</a>
<a id='line_850'>      excite the pity of the sultan of Damascus. By the command of</a>
<a id='line_851'>      Noureddin, and the sentence of the doctors, the holy names of</a>
<a id='line_852'>      Abubeker, Omar, and Othman, were solemnly restored: the caliph</a>
<a id='line_853'>      Mosthadi, of Bagdad, was acknowledged in the public prayers as</a>
<a id='line_854'>      the true commander of the faithful; and the green livery of the</a>
<a id='line_855'>      sons of Ali was exchanged for the black color of the Abbassides.</a>
<a id='line_856'>      The last of his race, the caliph Adhed, who survived only ten</a>
<a id='line_857'>      days, expired in happy ignorance of his fate; his treasures</a>
<a id='line_858'>      secured the loyalty of the soldiers, and silenced the murmurs of</a>
<a id='line_859'>      the sectaries; and in all subsequent revolutions, Egypt has never</a>

<a id='line_908'>      manners, seems to identify them with the Carduchians of the</a>
<a id='line_909'>      Greeks; 47 and they still defend against the Ottoman Porte the</a>
<a id='line_910'>      antique freedom which they asserted against the successors of</a>
<a id='line_911'>      Cyrus. Poverty and ambition prompted them to embrace the</a>
<a id='line_912'>      profession of mercenary soldiers: the service of his father and</a>
<a id='line_913'>      uncle prepared the reign of the great Saladin; 48 and the son of</a>
<a id='line_914'>      Job or Ayud, a simple Curd, magnanimously smiled at his</a>
<a id='line_915'>      pedigree, which flattery deduced from the Arabian caliphs. 49 So</a>
<a id='line_916'>      unconscious was Noureddin of the impending ruin of his house,</a>
<a id='line_917'>      that he constrained the reluctant youth to follow his uncle</a>
<a id='line_918'>      Shiracouh into Egypt: his military character was established by</a>
<a id='line_919'>      the defence of Alexandria; and, if we may believe the Latins, he</a>
<a id='line_920'>      solicited and obtained from the Christian general the</a>
<a id='line_921'>      _profane_honors of knighthood. 50 On the death of Shiracouh, the</a>
<a id='line_922'>      office of grand vizier was bestowed on Saladin, as the youngest</a>
<a id='line_923'>      and least powerful of the emirs; but with the advice of his</a>
<a id='line_924'>      father, whom he invited to Cairo, his genius obtained the</a>
<a id='line_925'>      ascendant over his equals, and attached the army to his person</a>
<a id='line_926'>      and interest. While Noureddin lived, these ambitious Curds were</a>
<a id='line_927'>      the most humble of his slaves; and the indiscreet murmurs of the</a>
<a id='line_928'>      divan were silenced by the prudent Ayub, who loudly protested</a>
<a id='line_929'>      that at the command of the sultan he himself would lead his sons</a>
<a id='line_930'>      in chains to the foot of the throne. “Such language,” he added in</a>
<a id='line_931'>      private, “was prudent and proper in an assembly of your rivals;</a>
<a id='line_932'>      but we are now above fear and obedience; and the threats of</a>
<a id='line_933'>      Noureddin shall not extort the tribute of a sugar-cane.” His</a>
<a id='line_934'>      seasonable death relieved them from the odious and doubtful</a>
<a id='line_935'>      conflict: his son, a minor of eleven years of age, was left for a</a>
<a id='line_936'>      while to the emirs of Damascus; and the new lord of Egypt was</a>
<a id='line_937'>      decorated by the caliph with every title 51 that could sanctify</a>
<a id='line_938'>      his usurpation in the eyes of the people. Nor was Saladin long</a>
<a id='line_939'>      content with the possession of Egypt; he despoiled the Christians</a>
<a id='line_940'>      of Jerusalem, and the Atabeks of Damascus, Aleppo, and Diarbekir:</a>
<a id='line_941'>      Mecca and Medina acknowledged him for their temporal protector:</a>
<a id='line_942'>      his brother subdued the distant regions of Yemen, or the happy</a>
<a id='line_943'>      Arabia; and at the hour of his death, his empire was spread from</a>
<a id='line_944'>      the African Tripoli to the Tigris, and from the Indian Ocean to</a>
<a id='line_945'>      the mountains of Armenia. In the judgment of his character, the</a>
<a id='line_946'>      reproaches of treason and ingratitude strike forcibly on _our_</a>
<a id='line_947'>      minds, impressed, as they are, with the principle and experience</a>
<a id='line_948'>      of law and loyalty. But his ambition may in some measure be</a>
<a id='line_949'>      excused by the revolutions of Asia, 52 which had erased every</a>
<a id='line_950'>      notion of legitimate succession; by the recent example of the</a>
<a id='line_951'>      Atabeks themselves; by his reverence to the son of his</a>
<a id='line_952'>      benefactor; his humane and generous behavior to the collateral</a>
<a id='line_953'>      branches; by _their_ incapacity and _his_ merit; by the</a>
<a id='line_954'>      approbation of the caliph, the sole source of all legitimate</a>
<a id='line_955'>      power; and, above all, by the wishes and interest of the people,</a>
<a id='line_956'>      whose happiness is the first object of government. In _his_</a>
<a id='line_957'>      virtues, and in those of his patron, they admired the singular</a>
<a id='line_958'>      union of the hero and the saint; for both Noureddin and Saladin</a>
<a id='line_959'>      are ranked among the Mahometan saints; and the constant</a>
<a id='line_960'>      meditation of the holy war appears to have shed a serious and</a>
<a id='line_961'>      sober color over their lives and actions. The youth of the latter</a>
<a id='line_962'>      53 was addicted to wine and women: but his aspiring spirit soon</a>
<a id='line_963'>      renounced the temptations of pleasure for the graver follies of</a>
<a id='line_964'>      fame and dominion: the garment of Saladin was of coarse woollen;</a>
<a id='line_965'>      water was his only drink; and, while he emulated the temperance,</a>
<a id='line_966'>      he surpassed the chastity, of his Arabian prophet. Both in faith</a>
<a id='line_967'>      and practice he was a rigid Mussulman: he ever deplored that the</a>
<a id='line_968'>      defence of religion had not allowed him to accomplish the</a>
<a id='line_969'>      pilgrimage of Mecca; but at the stated hours, five times each</a>
<a id='line_970'>      day, the sultan devoutly prayed with his brethren: the</a>
<a id='line_971'>      involuntary omission of fasting was scrupulously repaid; and his</a>
<a id='line_972'>      perusal of the Koran, on horseback between the approaching</a>
<a id='line_973'>      armies, may be quoted as a proof, however ostentatious, of piety</a>
<a id='line_974'>      and courage. 54 The superstitious doctrine of the sect of Shafei</a>
<a id='line_975'>      was the only study that he deigned to encourage: the poets were</a>
<a id='line_976'>      safe in his contempt; but all profane science was the object of</a>
<a id='line_977'>      his aversion; and a philosopher, who had invented some</a>
<a id='line_978'>      speculative novelties, was seized and strangled by the command of</a>
<a id='line_979'>      the royal saint. The justice of his divan was accessible to the</a>
<a id='line_980'>      meanest suppliant against himself and his ministers; and it was</a>
<a id='line_981'>      only for a kingdom that Saladin would deviate from the rule of</a>
<a id='line_982'>      equity. While the descendants of Seljuk and Zenghi held his</a>
<a id='line_983'>      stirrup and smoothed his garments, he was affable and patient</a>
<a id='line_984'>      with the meanest of his servants. So boundless was his</a>

<a id='line_1095'>      at the head of fourscore thousand horse and foot invaded the Holy</a>

<a id='line_1098'>      Jerusalem was persuaded to drain his garrison, and to arm his</a>

<a id='line_1102'>      curses of both nations: 60 Lusignan was overthrown, with the loss</a>
<a id='line_1103'>      of thirty thousand men; and the wood of the true cross (a dire</a>
<a id='line_1104'>      misfortune!) was left in the power of the infidels. 601 The royal</a>
<a id='line_1105'>      captive was conducted to the tent of Saladin; and as he fainted</a>
<a id='line_1106'>      with thirst and terror, the generous victor presented him with a</a>
<a id='line_1107'>      cup of sherbet, cooled in snow, without suffering his companion,</a>
<a id='line_1108'>      Reginald of Chatillon, to partake of this pledge of hospitality</a>
<a id='line_1109'>      and pardon. “The person and dignity of a king,” said the sultan,</a>
<a id='line_1110'>      “are sacred, but this impious robber must instantly acknowledge</a>
<a id='line_1111'>      the prophet, whom he has blasphemed, or meet the death which he</a>
<a id='line_1112'>      has so often deserved.” On the proud or conscientious refusal of</a>
<a id='line_1113'>      the Christian warrior, Saladin struck him on the head with his</a>
<a id='line_1114'>      cimeter, and Reginald was despatched by the guards. 61 The</a>

<a id='line_1230'>      misery of the vanquished. Instead of a rigorous exaction of his</a>
<a id='line_1231'>      debt, he accepted a sum of thirty thousand byzants, for the</a>
<a id='line_1232'>      ransom of seven thousand poor; two or three thousand more were</a>
<a id='line_1233'>      dismissed by his gratuitous clemency; and the number of slaves</a>
<a id='line_1234'>      was reduced to eleven or fourteen thousand persons. In this</a>
<a id='line_1235'>      interview with the queen, his words, and even his tears suggested</a>
<a id='line_1236'>      the kindest consolations; his liberal alms were distributed among</a>
<a id='line_1237'>      those who had been made orphans or widows by the fortune of war;</a>
<a id='line_1238'>      and while the knights of the hospital were in arms against him,</a>
<a id='line_1239'>      he allowed their more pious brethren to continue, during the term</a>
<a id='line_1240'>      of a year, the care and service of the sick. In these acts of</a>
<a id='line_1241'>      mercy the virtue of Saladin deserves our admiration and love: he</a>
<a id='line_1242'>      was above the necessity of dissimulation, and his stern</a>
<a id='line_1243'>      fanaticism would have prompted him to dissemble, rather than to</a>
<a id='line_1244'>      affect, this profane compassion for the enemies of the Koran.</a>
<a id='line_1245'>      After Jerusalem had been delivered from the presence of the</a>
<a id='line_1246'>      strangers, the sultan made his triumphal entry, his banners</a>
<a id='line_1247'>      waving in the wind, and to the harmony of martial music. The</a>
<a id='line_1248'>      great mosque of Omar, which had been converted into a church, was</a>
<a id='line_1249'>      again consecrated to one God and his prophet Mahomet: the walls</a>
<a id='line_1250'>      and pavement were purified with rose-water; and a pulpit, the</a>
<a id='line_1251'>      labor of Noureddin, was erected in the sanctuary. But when the</a>
<a id='line_1252'>      golden cross that glittered on the dome was cast down, and</a>
<a id='line_1253'>      dragged through the streets, the Christians of every sect uttered</a>
<a id='line_1254'>      a lamentable groan, which was answered by the joyful shouts of</a>
<a id='line_1255'>      the Moslems. In four ivory chests the patriarch had collected the</a>
<a id='line_1256'>      crosses, the images, the vases, and the relics of the holy place;</a>
<a id='line_1257'>      they were seized by the conqueror, who was desirous of presenting</a>
<a id='line_1258'>      the caliph with the trophies of Christian idolatry. He was</a>
<a id='line_1259'>      persuaded, however, to intrust them to the patriarch and prince</a>
<a id='line_1260'>      of Antioch; and the pious pledge was redeemed by Richard of</a>
<a id='line_1261'>      England, at the expense of fifty-two thousand byzants of gold. 64</a>

<a id='line_1272'>      after the death of Saladin. 65 In the career of victory, he was</a>
<a id='line_1273'>      first checked by the resistance of Tyre; the troops and</a>
<a id='line_1274'>      garrisons, which had capitulated, were imprudently conducted to</a>
<a id='line_1275'>      the same port: their numbers were adequate to the defence of the</a>
<a id='line_1276'>      place; and the arrival of Conrad of Montferrat inspired the</a>
<a id='line_1277'>      disorderly crowd with confidence and union. His father, a</a>
<a id='line_1278'>      venerable pilgrim, had been made prisoner in the battle of</a>
<a id='line_1279'>      Tiberias; but that disaster was unknown in Italy and Greece, when</a>
<a id='line_1280'>      the son was urged by ambition and piety to visit the inheritance</a>
<a id='line_1281'>      of his royal nephew, the infant Baldwin. The view of the Turkish</a>
<a id='line_1282'>      banners warned him from the hostile coast of Jaffa; and Conrad</a>
<a id='line_1283'>      was unanimously hailed as the prince and champion of Tyre, which</a>
<a id='line_1284'>      was already besieged by the conqueror of Jerusalem. The firmness</a>
<a id='line_1285'>      of his zeal, and perhaps his knowledge of a generous foe, enabled</a>
<a id='line_1286'>      him to brave the threats of the sultan, and to declare, that</a>
<a id='line_1287'>      should his aged parent be exposed before the walls, he himself</a>
<a id='line_1288'>      would discharge the first arrow, and glory in his descent from a</a>
<a id='line_1289'>      Christian martyr. 66 The Egyptian fleet was allowed to enter the</a>
<a id='line_1290'>      harbor of Tyre; but the chain was suddenly drawn, and five</a>
<a id='line_1291'>      galleys were either sunk or taken: a thousand Turks were slain in</a>
<a id='line_1292'>      a sally; and Saladin, after burning his engines, concluded a</a>
<a id='line_1293'>      glorious campaign by a disgraceful retreat to Damascus. He was</a>
<a id='line_1294'>      soon assailed by a more formidable tempest. The pathetic</a>
<a id='line_1295'>      narratives, and even the pictures, that represented in lively</a>
<a id='line_1296'>      colors the servitude and profanation of Jerusalem, awakened the</a>
<a id='line_1297'>      torpid sensibility of Europe: the emperor Frederic Barbarossa,</a>
<a id='line_1298'>      and the kings of France and England, assumed the cross; and the</a>
<a id='line_1299'>      tardy magnitude of their armaments was anticipated by the</a>
<a id='line_1300'>      maritime states of the Mediterranean and the Ocean. The skilful</a>
<a id='line_1301'>      and provident Italians first embarked in the ships of Genoa,</a>
<a id='line_1302'>      Pisa, and Venice. They were speedily followed by the most eager</a>
<a id='line_1303'>      pilgrims of France, Normandy, and the Western Isles. The powerful</a>
<a id='line_1304'>      succor of Flanders, Frise, and Denmark, filled near a hundred</a>
<a id='line_1305'>      vessels: and the Northern warriors were distinguished in the</a>
<a id='line_1306'>      field by a lofty stature and a ponderous battle-axe. 67 Their</a>
<a id='line_1307'>      increasing multitudes could no longer be confined within the</a>
<a id='line_1308'>      walls of Tyre, or remain obedient to the voice of Conrad. They</a>
<a id='line_1309'>      pitied the misfortunes, and revered the dignity, of Lusignan, who</a>
<a id='line_1310'>      was released from prison, perhaps, to divide the army of the</a>
<a id='line_1311'>      Franks. He proposed the recovery of Ptolemais, or Acre, thirty</a>
<a id='line_1312'>      miles to the south of Tyre; and the place was first invested by</a>
<a id='line_1313'>      two thousand horse and thirty thousand foot under his nominal</a>
<a id='line_1314'>      command. I shall not expatiate on the story of this memorable</a>
<a id='line_1315'>      siege; which lasted near two years, and consumed, in a narrow</a>
<a id='line_1316'>      space, the forces of Europe and Asia. Never did the flame of</a>
<a id='line_1317'>      enthusiasm burn with fiercer and more destructive rage; nor could</a>
<a id='line_1318'>      the true believers, a common appellation, who consecrated their</a>
<a id='line_1319'>      own martyrs, refuse some applause to the mistaken zeal and</a>
<a id='line_1320'>      courage of their adversaries. At the sound of the holy trumpet,</a>
<a id='line_1321'>      the Moslems of Egypt, Syria, Arabia, and the Oriental provinces,</a>
<a id='line_1322'>      assembled under the servant of the prophet: 68 his camp was</a>
<a id='line_1323'>      pitched and removed within a few miles of Acre; and he labored,</a>
<a id='line_1324'>      night and day, for the relief of his brethren and the annoyance</a>
<a id='line_1325'>      of the Franks. Nine battles, not unworthy of the name, were</a>
<a id='line_1326'>      fought in the neighborhood of Mount Carmel, with such vicissitude</a>
<a id='line_1327'>      of fortune, that in one attack, the sultan forced his way into</a>
<a id='line_1328'>      the city; that in one sally, the Christians penetrated to the</a>
<a id='line_1329'>      royal tent. By the means of divers and pigeons, a regular</a>
<a id='line_1330'>      correspondence was maintained with the besieged; and, as often as</a>
<a id='line_1331'>      the sea was left open, the exhausted garrison was withdrawn, and</a>
<a id='line_1332'>      a fresh supply was poured into the place. The Latin camp was</a>
<a id='line_1333'>      thinned by famine, the sword and the climate; but the tents of</a>
<a id='line_1334'>      the dead were replenished with new pilgrims, who exaggerated the</a>
<a id='line_1335'>      strength and speed of their approaching countrymen. The vulgar</a>
<a id='line_1336'>      was astonished by the report, that the pope himself, with an</a>
<a id='line_1337'>      innumerable crusade, was advanced as far as Constantinople. The</a>
<a id='line_1338'>      march of the emperor filled the East with more serious alarms:</a>
<a id='line_1339'>      the obstacles which he encountered in Asia, and perhaps in</a>
<a id='line_1340'>      Greece, were raised by the policy of Saladin: his joy on the</a>
<a id='line_1341'>      death of Barbarossa was measured by his esteem; and the</a>
<a id='line_1342'>      Christians were rather dismayed than encouraged at the sight of</a>
<a id='line_1343'>      the duke of Swabia and his way-worn remnant of five thousand</a>
<a id='line_1344'>      Germans. At length, in the spring of the second year, the royal</a>
<a id='line_1345'>      fleets of France and England cast anchor in the Bay of Acre, and</a>
<a id='line_1346'>      the siege was more vigorously prosecuted by the youthful</a>
<a id='line_1347'>      emulation of the two kings, Philip Augustus and Richard</a>
<a id='line_1348'>      Plantagenet. After every resource had been tried, and every hope</a>
<a id='line_1349'>      was exhausted, the defenders of Acre submitted to their fate; a</a>
<a id='line_1350'>      capitulation was granted, but their lives and liberties were</a>
<a id='line_1351'>      taxed at the hard conditions of a ransom of two hundred thousand</a>
<a id='line_1352'>      pieces of gold, the deliverance of one hundred nobles, and</a>
<a id='line_1353'>      fifteen hundred inferior captives, and the restoration of the</a>
<a id='line_1354'>      wood of the holy cross. Some doubts in the agreement, and some</a>
<a id='line_1355'>      delay in the execution, rekindled the fury of the Franks, and</a>
<a id='line_1356'>      three thousand Moslems, almost in the sultan’s view, were</a>
<a id='line_1357'>      beheaded by the command of the sanguinary Richard. 69 By the</a>
<a id='line_1358'>      conquest of Acre, the Latin powers acquired a strong town and a</a>
<a id='line_1359'>      convenient harbor; but the advantage was most dearly purchased.</a>
<a id='line_1360'>      The minister and historian of Saladin computes, from the report</a>
<a id='line_1361'>      of the enemy, that their numbers, at different periods, amounted</a>
<a id='line_1362'>      to five or six hundred thousand; that more than one hundred</a>
<a id='line_1363'>      thousand Christians were slain; that a far greater number was</a>
<a id='line_1364'>      lost by disease or shipwreck; and that a small portion of this</a>

<a id='line_1414'>      to the common enemy. In the eyes of the Orientals; the French</a>
<a id='line_1415'>      monarch was superior in dignity and power; and, in the emperor’s</a>
<a id='line_1416'>      absence, the Latins revered him as their temporal chief. 71 His</a>
<a id='line_1417'>      exploits were not adequate to his fame. Philip was brave, but the</a>
<a id='line_1418'>      statesman predominated in his character; he was soon weary of</a>
<a id='line_1419'>      sacrificing his health and interest on a barren coast: the</a>
<a id='line_1420'>      surrender of Acre became the signal of his departure; nor could</a>
<a id='line_1421'>      he justify this unpopular desertion, by leaving the duke of</a>
<a id='line_1422'>      Burgundy with five hundred knights and ten thousand foot, for the</a>
<a id='line_1423'>      service of the Holy Land. The king of England, though inferior in</a>
<a id='line_1424'>      dignity, surpassed his rival in wealth and military renown; 72</a>
<a id='line_1425'>      and if heroism be confined to brutal and ferocious valor, Richard</a>
<a id='line_1426'>      Plantagenet will stand high among the heroes of the age. The</a>
<a id='line_1427'>      memory of _Cur de Lion_, of the lion-hearted prince, was long</a>
<a id='line_1428'>      dear and glorious to his English subjects; and, at the distance</a>
<a id='line_1429'>      of sixty years, it was celebrated in proverbial sayings by the</a>
<a id='line_1430'>      grandsons of the Turks and Saracens, against whom he had fought:</a>
<a id='line_1431'>      his tremendous name was employed by the Syrian mothers to silence</a>
<a id='line_1432'>      their infants; and if a horse suddenly started from the way, his</a>
<a id='line_1433'>      rider was wont to exclaim, “Dost thou think King Richard is in</a>
<a id='line_1434'>      that bush?” 73 His cruelty to the Mahometans was the effect of</a>
<a id='line_1435'>      temper and zeal; but I cannot believe that a soldier, so free and</a>
<a id='line_1436'>      fearless in the use of his lance, would have descended to whet a</a>
<a id='line_1437'>      dagger against his valiant brother Conrad of Montferrat, who was</a>
<a id='line_1438'>      slain at Tyre by some secret assassins. 74 After the surrender of</a>
<a id='line_1439'>      Acre, and the departure of Philip, the king of England led the</a>
<a id='line_1440'>      crusaders to the recovery of the sea-coast; and the cities of</a>
<a id='line_1441'>      Cæsarea and Jaffa were added to the fragments of the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_1442'>      Lusignan. A march of one hundred miles from Acre to Ascalon was a</a>
<a id='line_1443'>      great and perpetual battle of eleven days. In the disorder of his</a>
<a id='line_1444'>      troops, Saladin remained on the field with seventeen guards,</a>
<a id='line_1445'>      without lowering his standard, or suspending the sound of his</a>
<a id='line_1446'>      brazen kettle-drum: he again rallied and renewed the charge; and</a>
<a id='line_1447'>      his preachers or heralds called aloud on the _unitarians_,</a>
<a id='line_1448'>      manfully to stand up against the Christian idolaters. But the</a>
<a id='line_1449'>      progress of these idolaters was irresistible; and it was only by</a>
<a id='line_1450'>      demolishing the walls and buildings of Ascalon, that the sultan</a>
<a id='line_1451'>      could prevent them from occupying an important fortress on the</a>
<a id='line_1452'>      confines of Egypt. During a severe winter, the armies slept; but</a>
<a id='line_1453'>      in the spring, the Franks advanced within a day’s march of</a>
<a id='line_1454'>      Jerusalem, under the leading standard of the English king; and</a>
<a id='line_1455'>      his active spirit intercepted a convoy, or caravan, of seven</a>
<a id='line_1456'>      thousand camels. Saladin 75 had fixed his station in the holy</a>
<a id='line_1457'>      city; but the city was struck with consternation and discord: he</a>
<a id='line_1458'>      fasted; he prayed; he preached; he offered to share the dangers</a>
<a id='line_1459'>      of the siege; but his Mamalukes, who remembered the fate of their</a>
<a id='line_1460'>      companions at Acre, pressed the sultan with loyal or seditious</a>
<a id='line_1461'>      clamors, to reserve _his_ person and _their_ courage for the</a>
<a id='line_1462'>      future defence of the religion and empire. 76 The Moslems were</a>
<a id='line_1463'>      delivered by the sudden, or, as they deemed, the miraculous,</a>
<a id='line_1464'>      retreat of the Christians; 77 and the laurels of Richard were</a>
<a id='line_1465'>      blasted by the prudence, or envy, of his companions. The hero,</a>
<a id='line_1466'>      ascending a hill, and veiling his face, exclaimed with an</a>
<a id='line_1467'>      indignant voice, “Those who are unwilling to rescue, are unworthy</a>
<a id='line_1468'>      to view, the sepulchre of Christ!” After his return to Acre, on</a>

<a id='line_1552'>      The health both of Richard and Saladin appeared to be in a</a>

<a id='line_1558'>      instruments, of his martial zeal. The first demands of the king</a>
<a id='line_1559'>      of England were the restitution of Jerusalem, Palestine, and the</a>
<a id='line_1560'>      true cross; and he firmly declared, that himself and his brother</a>
<a id='line_1561'>      pilgrims would end their lives in the pious labor, rather than</a>
<a id='line_1562'>      return to Europe with ignominy and remorse. But the conscience of</a>

<a id='line_1565'>      asserted, with equal firmness, his religious and civil claim to</a>
<a id='line_1566'>      the sovereignty of Palestine; descanted on the importance and</a>
<a id='line_1567'>      sanctity of Jerusalem; and rejected all terms of the</a>
<a id='line_1568'>      establishment, or partition of the Latins. The marriage which</a>
<a id='line_1569'>      Richard proposed, of his sister with the sultan’s brother, was</a>
<a id='line_1570'>      defeated by the difference of faith; the princess abhorred the</a>
<a id='line_1571'>      embraces of a Turk; and Adel, or Saphadin, would not easily</a>
<a id='line_1572'>      renounce a plurality of wives. A personal interview was declined</a>
<a id='line_1573'>      by Saladin, who alleged their mutual ignorance of each other’s</a>
<a id='line_1574'>      language; and the negotiation was managed with much art and delay</a>
<a id='line_1575'>      by their interpreters and envoys. The final agreement was equally</a>
<a id='line_1576'>      disapproved by the zealots of both parties, by the Roman pontiff</a>
<a id='line_1577'>      and the caliph of Bagdad. It was stipulated that Jerusalem and</a>
<a id='line_1578'>      the holy sepulchre should be open, without tribute or vexation,</a>
<a id='line_1579'>      to the pilgrimage of the Latin Christians; that, after the</a>
<a id='line_1580'>      demolition of Ascalon, they should inclusively possess the</a>
<a id='line_1581'>      sea-coast from Jaffa to Tyre; that the count of Tripoli and the</a>
<a id='line_1582'>      prince of Antioch should be comprised in the truce; and that,</a>
<a id='line_1583'>      during three years and three months, all hostilities should</a>
<a id='line_1584'>      cease. The principal chiefs of the two armies swore to the</a>
<a id='line_1585'>      observance of the treaty; but the monarchs were satisfied with</a>
<a id='line_1586'>      giving their word and their right hand; and the royal majesty was</a>

<a id='line_1588'>      falsehood and dishonor. Richard embarked for Europe, to seek a</a>
<a id='line_1589'>      long captivity and a premature grave; and the space of a few</a>
<a id='line_1590'>      months concluded the life and glories of Saladin. The Orientals</a>

<a id='line_1638'>      and ambitious priest, the successors of St. Peter attained the</a>
<a id='line_1639'>      full meridian of their greatness: and in a reign of eighteen</a>
<a id='line_1640'>      years, he exercised a despotic command over the emperors and</a>

<a id='line_1642'>      interdict of months or years deprived, for the offence of their</a>
<a id='line_1643'>      rulers, of the exercise of Christian worship. In the council of</a>
<a id='line_1644'>      the Lateran he acted as the ecclesiastical, almost as the</a>
<a id='line_1645'>      temporal, sovereign of the East and West. It was at the feet of</a>
<a id='line_1646'>      his legate that John of England surrendered his crown; and</a>
<a id='line_1647'>      Innocent may boast of the two most signal triumphs over sense and</a>
<a id='line_1648'>      humanity, the establishment of transubstantiation, and the origin</a>
<a id='line_1649'>      of the inquisition. At his voice, two crusades, the fourth and</a>
<a id='line_1650'>      the fifth, were undertaken; but, except a king of Hungary, the</a>
<a id='line_1651'>      princes of the second order were at the head of the pilgrims: the</a>
<a id='line_1652'>      forces were inadequate to the design; nor did the effects</a>
<a id='line_1653'>      correspond with the hopes and wishes of the pope and the people.</a>
<a id='line_1654'>      The fourth crusade was diverted from Syria to Constantinople; and</a>
<a id='line_1655'>      the conquest of the Greek or Roman empire by the Latins will form</a>
<a id='line_1656'>      the proper and important subject of the next chapter. In the</a>
<a id='line_1657'>      fifth, 85 two hundred thousand Franks were landed at the eastern</a>
<a id='line_1658'>      mouth of the Nile. They reasonably hoped that Palestine must be</a>
<a id='line_1659'>      subdued in Egypt, the seat and storehouse of the sultan; and,</a>
<a id='line_1660'>      after a siege of sixteen months, the Moslems deplored the loss of</a>
<a id='line_1661'>      Damietta. But the Christian army was ruined by the pride and</a>
<a id='line_1662'>      insolence of the legate Pelagius, who, in the pope’s name,</a>
<a id='line_1663'>      assumed the character of general: the sickly Franks were</a>
<a id='line_1664'>      encompassed by the waters of the Nile and the Oriental forces;</a>
<a id='line_1665'>      and it was by the evacuation of Damietta that they obtained a</a>
<a id='line_1666'>      safe retreat, some concessions for the pilgrims, and the tardy</a>
<a id='line_1667'>      restitution of the doubtful relic of the true cross. The failure</a>
<a id='line_1668'>      may in some measure be ascribed to the abuse and multiplication</a>
<a id='line_1669'>      of the crusades, which were preached at the same time against the</a>
<a id='line_1670'>      Pagans of Livonia, the Moors of Spain, the Albigeois of France,</a>
<a id='line_1671'>      and the kings of Sicily of the Imperial family. 86 In these</a>
<a id='line_1672'>      meritorious services, the volunteers might acquire at home the</a>
<a id='line_1673'>      same spiritual indulgence, and a larger measure of temporal</a>
<a id='line_1674'>      rewards; and even the popes, in their zeal against a domestic</a>
<a id='line_1675'>      enemy, were sometimes tempted to forget the distress of their</a>
<a id='line_1676'>      Syrian brethren. From the last age of the crusades they derived</a>
<a id='line_1677'>      the occasional command of an army and revenue; and some deep</a>
<a id='line_1678'>      reasoners have suspected that the whole enterprise, from the</a>
<a id='line_1679'>      first synod of Placentia, was contrived and executed by the</a>
<a id='line_1680'>      policy of Rome. The suspicion is not founded, either in nature or</a>
<a id='line_1681'>      in fact. The successors of St. Peter appear to have followed,</a>
<a id='line_1682'>      rather than guided, the impulse of manners and prejudice; without</a>
<a id='line_1683'>      much foresight of the seasons, or cultivation of the soil, they</a>

<a id='line_1685'>      the times. They gathered these fruits without toil or personal</a>
<a id='line_1686'>      danger: in the council of the Lateran, Innocent the Third</a>
<a id='line_1687'>      declared an ambiguous resolution of animating the crusaders by</a>
<a id='line_1688'>      his example; but the pilot of the sacred vessel could not abandon</a>

<a id='line_1725'>      operations, and enforcing, by commands and censures, the</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      accomplishment of their vow. Frederic the Second, 88 the grandson</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      of Barbarossa, was successively the pupil, the enemy, and the</a>
<a id='line_1728'>      victim of the church. At the age of twenty-one years, and in</a>
<a id='line_1729'>      obedience to his guardian Innocent the Third, he assumed the</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      cross; the same promise was repeated at his royal and imperial</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      coronations; and his marriage with the heiress of Jerusalem</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      forever bound him to defend the kingdom of his son Conrad. But as</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      Frederic advanced in age and authority, he repented of the rash</a>
<a id='line_1734'>      engagements of his youth: his liberal sense and knowledge taught</a>
<a id='line_1735'>      him to despise the phantoms of superstition and the crowns of</a>
<a id='line_1736'>      Asia: he no longer entertained the same reverence for the</a>
<a id='line_1737'>      successors of Innocent: and his ambition was occupied by the</a>
<a id='line_1738'>      restoration of the Italian monarchy from Sicily to the Alps. But</a>
<a id='line_1739'>      the success of this project would have reduced the popes to their</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      primitive simplicity; and, after the delays and excuses of twelve</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      years, they urged the emperor, with entreaties and threats, to</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      fix the time and place of his departure for Palestine. In the</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      harbors of Sicily and Apulia, he prepared a fleet of one hundred</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      galleys, and of one hundred vessels, that were framed to</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      transport and land two thousand five hundred knights, with their</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      horses and attendants; his vassals of Naples and Germany formed a</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      powerful army; and the number of English crusaders was magnified</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      to sixty thousand by the report of fame. But the inevitable or</a>
<a id='line_1749'>      affected slowness of these mighty preparations consumed the</a>
<a id='line_1750'>      strength and provisions of the more indigent pilgrims: the</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      multitude was thinned by sickness and desertion; and the sultry</a>
<a id='line_1752'>      summer of Calabria anticipated the mischiefs of a Syrian</a>
<a id='line_1753'>      campaign. At length the emperor hoisted sail at Brundusium, with</a>
<a id='line_1754'>      a fleet and army of forty thousand men: but he kept the sea no</a>
<a id='line_1755'>      more than three days; and his hasty retreat, which was ascribed</a>
<a id='line_1756'>      by his friends to a grievous indisposition, was accused by his</a>
<a id='line_1757'>      enemies as a voluntary and obstinate disobedience. For suspending</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      his vow was Frederic excommunicated by Gregory the Ninth; for</a>
<a id='line_1759'>      presuming, the next year, to accomplish his vow, he was again</a>
<a id='line_1760'>      excommunicated by the same pope. 89 While he served under the</a>
<a id='line_1761'>      banner of the cross, a crusade was preached against him in Italy;</a>
<a id='line_1762'>      and after his return he was compelled to ask pardon for the</a>
<a id='line_1763'>      injuries which he had suffered. The clergy and military orders of</a>
<a id='line_1764'>      Palestine were previously instructed to renounce his communion</a>
<a id='line_1765'>      and dispute his commands; and in his own kingdom, the emperor was</a>
<a id='line_1766'>      forced to consent that the orders of the camp should be issued in</a>
<a id='line_1767'>      the name of God and of the Christian republic. Frederic entered</a>
<a id='line_1768'>      Jerusalem in triumph; and with his own hands (for no priest would</a>
<a id='line_1769'>      perform the office) he took the crown from the altar of the holy</a>
<a id='line_1770'>      sepulchre. But the patriarch cast an interdict on the church</a>
<a id='line_1771'>      which his presence had profaned; and the knights of the hospital</a>
<a id='line_1772'>      and temple informed the sultan how easily he might be surprised</a>
<a id='line_1773'>      and slain in his unguarded visit to the River Jordan. In such a</a>
<a id='line_1774'>      state of fanaticism and faction, victory was hopeless, and</a>
<a id='line_1775'>      defence was difficult; but the conclusion of an advantageous</a>
<a id='line_1776'>      peace may be imputed to the discord of the Mahometans, and their</a>
<a id='line_1777'>      personal esteem for the character of Frederic. The enemy of the</a>
<a id='line_1778'>      church is accused of maintaining with the miscreants an</a>
<a id='line_1779'>      intercourse of hospitality and friendship unworthy of a</a>
<a id='line_1780'>      Christian; of despising the barrenness of the land; and of</a>
<a id='line_1781'>      indulging a profane thought, that if Jehovah had seen the kingdom</a>
<a id='line_1782'>      of Naples he never would have selected Palestine for the</a>
<a id='line_1783'>      inheritance of his chosen people. Yet Frederic obtained from the</a>
<a id='line_1784'>      sultan the restitution of Jerusalem, of Bethlem and Nazareth, of</a>
<a id='line_1785'>      Tyre and Sidon; the Latins were allowed to inhabit and fortify</a>
<a id='line_1786'>      the city; an equal code of civil and religious freedom was</a>
<a id='line_1787'>      ratified for the sectaries of Jesus and those of Mahomet; and,</a>
<a id='line_1788'>      while the former worshipped at the holy sepulchre, the latter</a>
<a id='line_1789'>      might pray and preach in the mosque of the temple, 90 from whence</a>
<a id='line_1790'>      the prophet undertook his nocturnal journey to heaven. The clergy</a>
<a id='line_1791'>      deplored this scandalous toleration; and the weaker Moslems were</a>
<a id='line_1792'>      gradually expelled; but every rational object of the crusades was</a>
<a id='line_1793'>      accomplished without bloodshed; the churches were restored, the</a>
<a id='line_1794'>      monasteries were replenished; and, in the space of fifteen years,</a>

<a id='line_1796'>      peace and prosperity, for which they were ungrateful to their</a>

<a id='line_1903'>      invincible contempt of danger and discipline: his brother, the</a>

<a id='line_1908'>      Christians was far behind the vanguard; and Artois was</a>
<a id='line_1909'>      overpowered and slain. A shower of Greek fire was incessantly</a>

<a id='line_1913'>      about the same time a retreat was found to be necessary and</a>

<a id='line_1921'>      a robe of honor to his royal captive, and his deliverance, with</a>
<a id='line_1922'>      that of his soldiers, was obtained by the restitution of Damietta</a>
<a id='line_1923'>      98 and the payment of four hundred thousand pieces of gold. In a</a>
<a id='line_1924'>      soft and luxurious climate, the degenerate children of the</a>
<a id='line_1925'>      companions of Noureddin and Saladin were incapable of resisting</a>
<a id='line_1926'>      the flower of European chivalry: they triumphed by the arms of</a>
<a id='line_1927'>      their slaves or Mamalukes, the hardy natives of Tartary, who at a</a>
<a id='line_1928'>      tender age had been purchased of the Syrian merchants, and were</a>

<a id='line_2096'>      all the disciples of Jesus and Mahomet, the male and female</a>
<a id='line_2097'>      inhabitants of Acre were esteemed the most corrupt; nor could the</a>

<a id='line_2110'>      nineteen Syrian merchants, who traded under the public faith,</a>
<a id='line_2111'>      were despoiled and hanged by the Christians; and the denial of</a>
<a id='line_2112'>      satisfaction justified the arms of the sultan Khalil. He marched</a>
<a id='line_2113'>      against Acre, at the head of sixty thousand horse and one hundred</a>
<a id='line_2114'>      and forty thousand foot: his train of artillery (if I may use the</a>

<a id='line_2116'>      engine were transported in one hundred wagons; and the royal</a>
<a id='line_2117'>      historian Abulfeda, who served with the troops of Hamah, was</a>
<a id='line_2118'>      himself a spectator of the holy war. Whatever might be the vices</a>
<a id='line_2119'>      of the Franks, their courage was rekindled by enthusiasm and</a>
<a id='line_2120'>      despair; but they were torn by the discord of seventeen chiefs,</a>
<a id='line_2121'>      and overwhelmed on all sides by the powers of the sultan. After a</a>

<a id='line_2124'>      Mamalukes made a general assault; the city was stormed; and death</a>
<a id='line_2125'>      or slavery was the lot of sixty thousand Christians. The convent,</a>
<a id='line_2126'>      or rather fortress, of the Templars resisted three days longer;</a>
<a id='line_2127'>      but the great master was pierced with an arrow; and, of five</a>
