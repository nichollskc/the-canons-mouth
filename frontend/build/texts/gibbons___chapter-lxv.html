<a id='line_9'></a>
<a id='line_10'>      The conquest and monarchy of the world was the first object of</a>
<a id='line_11'>      the ambition of Timour. To live in the memory and esteem of</a>
<a id='line_12'>      future ages was the second wish of his magnanimous spirit. All</a>
<a id='line_13'>      the civil and military transactions of his reign were diligently</a>
<a id='line_14'>      recorded in the journals of his secretaries: 1 the authentic</a>
<a id='line_15'>      narrative was revised by the persons best informed of each</a>
<a id='line_16'>      particular transaction; and it is believed in the empire and</a>
<a id='line_17'>      family of Timour, that the monarch himself composed the</a>
<a id='line_18'>      _commentaries_ 2 of his life, and the _institutions_ 3 of his</a>
<a id='line_19'>      government. 4 But these cares were ineffectual for the</a>
<a id='line_20'>      preservation of his fame, and these precious memorials in the</a>
<a id='line_21'>      Mogul or Persian language were concealed from the world, or, at</a>
<a id='line_22'>      least, from the knowledge of Europe. The nations which he</a>
<a id='line_23'>      vanquished exercised a base and impotent revenge; and ignorance</a>
<a id='line_24'>      has long repeated the tale of calumny, 5 which had disfigured the</a>
<a id='line_25'>      birth and character, the person, and even the name, of</a>
<a id='line_26'>      _Tamerlane_. 6 Yet his real merit would be enhanced, rather than</a>
<a id='line_27'>      debased, by the elevation of a peasant to the throne of Asia; nor</a>
<a id='line_28'>      can his lameness be a theme of reproach, unless he had the</a>
<a id='line_29'>      weakness to blush at a natural, or perhaps an honorable,</a>

<a id='line_47'>      eventful period.” * Note: The manuscript of Major Davy has been</a>
<a id='line_48'>      translated by Major Stewart, and published by the Oriental</a>
<a id='line_49'>      Translation Committee of London. It contains the life of Timour,</a>
<a id='line_50'>      from his birth to his forty-first year; but the last thirty years</a>
<a id='line_51'>      of western war and conquest are wanting. Major Stewart intimates</a>
<a id='line_52'>      that two manuscripts exist in this country containing the whole</a>
<a id='line_53'>      work, but excuses himself, on account of his age, from</a>
<a id='line_54'>      undertaking the laborious task of completing the translation. It</a>
<a id='line_55'>      is to be hoped that the European public will be soon enabled to</a>

<a id='line_58'>      of Dreams and Omens—a wild, but characteristic, chronicle of</a>
<a id='line_59'>      Visions and Sortes Koranicæ. Strange that a life of Timour should</a>

<a id='line_61'>      dawn and the gradual expression of his not less splendid but more</a>

<a id='line_114'>      In the eyes of the Moguls, who held the indefeasible succession</a>
<a id='line_115'>      of the house of Zingis, he was doubtless a rebel subject; yet he</a>
<a id='line_116'>      sprang from the noble tribe of Berlass: his fifth ancestor,</a>
<a id='line_117'>      Carashar Nevian, had been the vizier 607 of Zagatai, in his new</a>
<a id='line_118'>      realm of Transoxiana; and in the ascent of some generations, the</a>
<a id='line_119'>      branch of Timour is confounded, at least by the females, 7 with</a>
<a id='line_120'>      the Imperial stem. 8 He was born forty miles to the south of</a>
<a id='line_121'>      Samarcand in the village of Sebzar, in the fruitful territory of</a>
<a id='line_122'>      Cash, of which his fathers were the hereditary chiefs, as well as</a>
<a id='line_123'>      of a toman of ten thousand horse. 9 His birth 10 was cast on one</a>
<a id='line_124'>      of those periods of anarchy, which announce the fall of the</a>
<a id='line_125'>      Asiatic dynasties, and open a new field to adventurous ambition.</a>
<a id='line_126'>      The khans of Zagatai were extinct; the emirs aspired to</a>
<a id='line_127'>      independence; and their domestic feuds could only be suspended by</a>
<a id='line_128'>      the conquest and tyranny of the khans of Kashgar, who, with an</a>
<a id='line_129'>      army of Getes or Calmucks, 11 invaded the Transoxian kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_130'>      From the twelfth year of his age, Timour had entered the field of</a>
<a id='line_131'>      action; in the twenty-fifth 111 he stood forth as the deliverer</a>
<a id='line_132'>      of his country; and the eyes and wishes of the people were turned</a>
<a id='line_133'>      towards a hero who suffered in their cause. The chiefs of the law</a>
<a id='line_134'>      and of the army had pledged their salvation to support him with</a>
<a id='line_135'>      their lives and fortunes; but in the hour of danger they were</a>
<a id='line_136'>      silent and afraid; and, after waiting seven days on the hills of</a>
<a id='line_137'>      Samarcand, he retreated to the desert with only sixty horsemen.</a>
<a id='line_138'>      The fugitives were overtaken by a thousand Getes, whom he</a>
<a id='line_139'>      repulsed with incredible slaughter, and his enemies were forced</a>
<a id='line_140'>      to exclaim, “Timour is a wonderful man: fortune and the divine</a>
<a id='line_141'>      favor are with him.” But in this bloody action his own followers</a>
<a id='line_142'>      were reduced to ten, a number which was soon diminished by the</a>
<a id='line_143'>      desertion of three Carizmians. 112 He wandered in the desert with</a>
<a id='line_144'>      his wife, seven companions, and four horses; and sixty-two days</a>
<a id='line_145'>      was he plunged in a loathsome dungeon, from whence he escaped by</a>
<a id='line_146'>      his own courage and the remorse of the oppressor. After swimming</a>
<a id='line_147'>      the broad and rapid steam of the Jihoon, or Oxus, he led, during</a>
<a id='line_148'>      some months, the life of a vagrant and outlaw, on the borders of</a>
<a id='line_149'>      the adjacent states. But his fame shone brighter in adversity; he</a>
<a id='line_150'>      learned to distinguish the friends of his person, the associates</a>
<a id='line_151'>      of his fortune, and to apply the various characters of men for</a>
<a id='line_152'>      their advantage, and, above all, for his own. On his return to</a>
<a id='line_153'>      his native country, Timour was successively joined by the parties</a>
<a id='line_154'>      of his confederates, who anxiously sought him in the desert; nor</a>
<a id='line_155'>      can I refuse to describe, in his pathetic simplicity, one of</a>
<a id='line_156'>      their fortunate encounters. He presented himself as a guide to</a>
<a id='line_157'>      three chiefs, who were at the head of seventy horse. “When their</a>
<a id='line_158'>      eyes fell upon me,” says Timour, “they were overwhelmed with joy;</a>
<a id='line_159'>      and they alighted from their horses; and they came and kneeled;</a>
<a id='line_160'>      and they kissed my stirrup. I also came down from my horse, and</a>
<a id='line_161'>      took each of them in my arms. And I put my turban on the head of</a>
<a id='line_162'>      the first chief; and my girdle, rich in jewels and wrought with</a>
<a id='line_163'>      gold, I bound on the loins of the second; and the third I clothed</a>
<a id='line_164'>      in my own coat. And they wept, and I wept also; and the hour of</a>
<a id='line_165'>      prayer was arrived, and we prayed. And we mounted our horses, and</a>
<a id='line_166'>      came to my dwelling; and I collected my people, and made a</a>
<a id='line_167'>      feast.” His trusty bands were soon increased by the bravest of</a>
<a id='line_168'>      the tribes; he led them against a superior foe; and, after some</a>
<a id='line_169'>      vicissitudes of war the Getes were finally driven from the</a>
<a id='line_170'>      kingdom of Transoxiana. He had done much for his own glory; but</a>
<a id='line_171'>      much remained to be done, much art to be exerted, and some blood</a>
<a id='line_172'>      to be spilt, before he could teach his equals to obey him as</a>
<a id='line_173'>      their master. The birth and power of emir Houssein compelled him</a>
<a id='line_174'>      to accept a vicious and unworthy colleague, whose sister was the</a>
<a id='line_175'>      best beloved of his wives. Their union was short and jealous; but</a>
<a id='line_176'>      the policy of Timour, in their frequent quarrels, exposed his</a>
<a id='line_177'>      rival to the reproach of injustice and perfidy; and, after a</a>
<a id='line_178'>      final defeat, Houssein was slain by some sagacious friends, who</a>
<a id='line_179'>      presumed, for the last time, to disobey the commands of their</a>
<a id='line_180'>      lord. 113 At the age of thirty-four, 12 and in a general diet or</a>
<a id='line_181'>      _couroultai_, he was invested with _Imperial_ command, but he</a>
<a id='line_182'>      affected to revere the house of Zingis; and while the emir Timour</a>
<a id='line_183'>      reigned over Zagatai and the East, a nominal khan served as a</a>
<a id='line_184'>      private officer in the armies of his servant. A fertile kingdom,</a>
<a id='line_185'>      five hundred miles in length and in breadth, might have satisfied</a>
<a id='line_186'>      the ambition of a subject; but Timour aspired to the dominion of</a>
<a id='line_187'>      the world; and before his death, the crown of Zagatai was one of</a>
<a id='line_188'>      the twenty-seven crowns which he had placed on his head. Without</a>

<a id='line_309'>      firm as a rock, and received on his helmet two weighty strokes of</a>
<a id='line_310'>      a cimeter: 15 the Moguls rallied; the head of Mansour was thrown</a>
<a id='line_311'>      at his feet; and he declared his esteem of the valor of a foe, by</a>

<a id='line_354'>      subdued the kingdom of Kashgar, and marched seven times into the</a>

<a id='line_358'>      engraved in the forests of Siberia a rude memorial of their</a>
<a id='line_359'>      exploits. The conquest of Kipzak, or the Western Tartary, 17 was</a>
<a id='line_360'>      founded on the double motive of aiding the distressed, and</a>
<a id='line_361'>      chastising the ungrateful. Toctamish, a fugitive prince, was</a>
<a id='line_362'>      entertained and protected in his court: the ambassadors of Auruss</a>
<a id='line_363'>      Khan were dismissed with a haughty denial, and followed on the</a>
<a id='line_364'>      same day by the armies of Zagatai; and their success established</a>
<a id='line_365'>      Toctamish in the Mogul empire of the North. But, after a reign of</a>
<a id='line_366'>      ten years, the new khan forgot the merits and the strength of his</a>
<a id='line_367'>      benefactor; the base usurper, as he deemed him, of the sacred</a>
<a id='line_368'>      rights of the house of Zingis. Through the gates of Derbend, he</a>
<a id='line_369'>      entered Persia at the head of ninety thousand horse: with the</a>
<a id='line_370'>      innumerable forces of Kipzak, Bulgaria, Circassia, and Russia, he</a>
<a id='line_371'>      passed the Sihoon, burnt the palaces of Timour, and compelled</a>
<a id='line_372'>      him, amidst the winter snows, to contend for Samarcand and his</a>
<a id='line_373'>      life. After a mild expostulation, and a glorious victory, the</a>
<a id='line_374'>      emperor resolved on revenge; and by the east, and the west, of</a>
<a id='line_375'>      the Caspian, and the Volga, he twice invaded Kipzak with such</a>
<a id='line_376'>      mighty powers, that thirteen miles were measured from his right</a>
<a id='line_377'>      to his left wing. In a march of five months, they rarely beheld</a>
<a id='line_378'>      the footsteps of man; and their daily subsistence was often</a>
<a id='line_379'>      trusted to the fortune of the chase. At length the armies</a>
<a id='line_380'>      encountered each other; but the treachery of the standard-bearer,</a>
<a id='line_381'>      who, in the heat of action, reversed the Imperial standard of</a>
<a id='line_382'>      Kipzak, determined the victory of the Zagatais; and Toctamish (I</a>
<a id='line_383'>      speak the language of the Institutions) gave the tribe of Toushi</a>
<a id='line_384'>      to the wind of desolation. 18 He fled to the Christian duke of</a>
<a id='line_385'>      Lithuania; again returned to the banks of the Volga; and, after</a>
<a id='line_386'>      fifteen battles with a domestic rival, at last perished in the</a>
<a id='line_387'>      wilds of Siberia. The pursuit of a flying enemy carried Timour</a>
<a id='line_388'>      into the tributary provinces of Russia: a duke of the reigning</a>
<a id='line_389'>      family was made prisoner amidst the ruins of his capital; and</a>
<a id='line_390'>      Yeletz, by the pride and ignorance of the Orientals, might easily</a>
<a id='line_391'>      be confounded with the genuine metropolis of the nation. Moscow</a>
<a id='line_392'>      trembled at the approach of the Tartar, and the resistance would</a>
<a id='line_393'>      have been feeble, since the hopes of the Russians were placed in</a>
<a id='line_394'>      a miraculous image of the Virgin, to whose protection they</a>

<a id='line_406'>      followed by the destructive presence of the Tartars. The city was</a>

<a id='line_466'>      enterprise of such tremendous aspect was safe and easy in the</a>
<a id='line_467'>      execution. He was informed by his spies of the weakness and</a>
<a id='line_468'>      anarchy of Hindostan: the soubahs of the provinces had erected</a>
<a id='line_469'>      the standard of rebellion; and the perpetual infancy of Sultan</a>

<a id='line_472'>      pleasure, that the ninety-two squadrons of a thousand horse most</a>
<a id='line_473'>      fortunately corresponded with the ninety-two names or epithets of</a>

<a id='line_475'>      crossed one of the ridges of mountains, which are styled by the</a>
<a id='line_476'>      Arabian geographers The Stony Girdles of the Earth. The highland</a>
<a id='line_477'>      robbers were subdued or extirpated; but great numbers of men and</a>
<a id='line_478'>      horses perished in the snow; the emperor himself was let down a</a>
<a id='line_479'>      precipice on a portable scaffold—the ropes were one hundred and</a>
<a id='line_480'>      fifty cubits in length; and before he could reach the bottom,</a>
<a id='line_481'>      this dangerous operation was five times repeated. Timour crossed</a>

<a id='line_487'>      Timour was to join his grandson, who had achieved by his command</a>
<a id='line_488'>      the conquest of Moultan. On the eastern bank of the Hyphasis, on</a>
<a id='line_489'>      the edge of the desert, the Macedonian hero halted and wept: the</a>
<a id='line_490'>      Mogul entered the desert, reduced the fortress of Batmir, and</a>
<a id='line_491'>      stood in arms before the gates of Delhi, a great and flourishing</a>
<a id='line_492'>      city, which had subsisted three centuries under the dominion of</a>
<a id='line_493'>      the Mahometan kings. 251 The siege, more especially of the</a>
<a id='line_494'>      castle, might have been a work of time; but he tempted, by the</a>
<a id='line_495'>      appearance of weakness, the sultan Mahmoud and his vizier to</a>
<a id='line_496'>      descend into the plain, with ten thousand cuirassiers, forty</a>
<a id='line_497'>      thousand of his foot-guards, and one hundred and twenty</a>
<a id='line_498'>      elephants, whose tusks are said to have been armed with sharp and</a>
<a id='line_499'>      poisoned daggers. Against these monsters, or rather against the</a>
<a id='line_500'>      imagination of his troops, he condescended to use some</a>
<a id='line_501'>      extraordinary precautions of fire and a ditch, of iron spikes and</a>
<a id='line_502'>      a rampart of bucklers; but the event taught the Moguls to smile</a>
<a id='line_503'>      at their own fears; and as soon as these unwieldy animals were</a>
<a id='line_504'>      routed, the inferior species (the men of India) disappeared from</a>
<a id='line_505'>      the field. Timour made his triumphal entry into the capital of</a>
<a id='line_506'>      Hindostan; and admired, with a view to imitate, the architecture</a>
<a id='line_507'>      of the stately mosque; but the order or license of a general</a>
<a id='line_508'>      pillage and massacre polluted the festival of his victory. He</a>
<a id='line_509'>      resolved to purify his soldiers in the blood of the idolaters, or</a>
<a id='line_510'>      Gentoos, who still surpass, in the proportion of ten to one, the</a>
<a id='line_511'>      numbers of the Moslems. 252 In this pious design, he advanced one</a>
<a id='line_512'>      hundred miles to the north-east of Delhi, passed the Ganges,</a>
<a id='line_513'>      fought several battles by land and water, and penetrated to the</a>

<a id='line_518'>      justify the strange foresight of his emirs, that their children</a>

<a id='line_580'>      first directed against the Christians of Georgia, who were strong</a>

<a id='line_582'>      these obstacles were overcome by the zeal and perseverance of</a>

<a id='line_588'>      hostile correspondence of complaints and menaces, which fermented</a>
<a id='line_589'>      two years before the final explosion. Between two jealous and</a>
<a id='line_590'>      haughty neighbors, the motives of quarrel will seldom be wanting.</a>
<a id='line_591'>      The Mogul and Ottoman conquests now touched each other in the</a>

<a id='line_595'>      territory, of threatening his vassals, and protecting his rebels;</a>

<a id='line_597'>      whose kingdoms he had usurped, and whose life or liberty he</a>
<a id='line_598'>      implacably pursued. The resemblance of character was still more</a>
<a id='line_599'>      dangerous than the opposition of interest; and in their</a>
<a id='line_600'>      victorious career, Timour was impatient of an equal, and Bajazet</a>
<a id='line_601'>      was ignorant of a superior. The first epistle 28 of the Mogul</a>
<a id='line_602'>      emperor must have provoked, instead of reconciling, the Turkish</a>
<a id='line_603'>      sultan, whose family and nation he affected to despise. 29 “Dost</a>
<a id='line_604'>      thou not know, that the greatest part of Asia is subject to our</a>
<a id='line_605'>      arms and our laws? that our invincible forces extend from one sea</a>
<a id='line_606'>      to the other? that the potentates of the earth form a line before</a>
<a id='line_607'>      our gate? and that we have compelled Fortune herself to watch</a>
<a id='line_608'>      over the prosperity of our empire. What is the foundation of thy</a>
<a id='line_609'>      insolence and folly? Thou hast fought some battles in the woods</a>
<a id='line_610'>      of Anatolia; contemptible trophies! Thou hast obtained some</a>
<a id='line_611'>      victories over the Christians of Europe; thy sword was blessed by</a>
<a id='line_612'>      the apostle of God; and thy obedience to the precept of the</a>
<a id='line_613'>      Koran, in waging war against the infidels, is the sole</a>
<a id='line_614'>      consideration that prevents us from destroying thy country, the</a>
<a id='line_615'>      frontier and bulwark of the Moslem world. Be wise in time;</a>
<a id='line_616'>      reflect; repent; and avert the thunder of our vengeance, which is</a>
<a id='line_617'>      yet suspended over thy head. Thou art no more than a pismire; why</a>
<a id='line_618'>      wilt thou seek to provoke the elephants? Alas! they will trample</a>
<a id='line_619'>      thee under their feet.” In his replies, Bajazet poured forth the</a>
<a id='line_620'>      indignation of a soul which was deeply stung by such unusual</a>
<a id='line_621'>      contempt. After retorting the basest reproaches on the thief and</a>
<a id='line_622'>      rebel of the desert, the Ottoman recapitulates his boasted</a>
<a id='line_623'>      victories in Iran, Touran, and the Indies; and labors to prove,</a>
<a id='line_624'>      that Timour had never triumphed unless by his own perfidy and the</a>
<a id='line_625'>      vices of his foes. “Thy armies are innumerable: be they so; but</a>
<a id='line_626'>      what are the arrows of the flying Tartar against the cimeters and</a>
<a id='line_627'>      battle-axes of my firm and invincible Janizaries? I will guard</a>
<a id='line_628'>      the princes who have implored my protection: seek them in my</a>
<a id='line_629'>      tents. The cities of Arzingan and Erzeroum are mine; and unless</a>
<a id='line_630'>      the tribute be duly paid, I will demand the arrears under the</a>
<a id='line_631'>      walls of Tauris and Sultania.” The ungovernable rage of the</a>
<a id='line_632'>      sultan at length betrayed him to an insult of a more domestic</a>
<a id='line_633'>      kind. “If I fly from thy arms,” said he, “may _my_ wives be</a>
<a id='line_634'>      thrice divorced from my bed: but if thou hast not courage to meet</a>
<a id='line_635'>      me in the field, mayest thou again receive _thy_ wives after they</a>
<a id='line_636'>      have thrice endured the embraces of a stranger.” 30 Any violation</a>
<a id='line_637'>      by word or deed of the secrecy of the harem is an unpardonable</a>
<a id='line_638'>      offence among the Turkish nations; 31 and the political quarrel</a>
<a id='line_639'>      of the two monarchs was imbittered by private and personal</a>
<a id='line_640'>      resentment. Yet in his first expedition, Timour was satisfied</a>
<a id='line_641'>      with the siege and destruction of Siwas or Sebaste, a strong city</a>
<a id='line_642'>      on the borders of Anatolia; and he revenged the indiscretion of</a>
<a id='line_643'>      the Ottoman, on a garrison of four thousand Armenians, who were</a>
<a id='line_644'>      buried alive for the brave and faithful discharge of their duty.</a>
<a id='line_645'>      311 As a Mussulman, he seemed to respect the pious occupation of</a>
<a id='line_646'>      Bajazet, who was still engaged in the blockade of Constantinople;</a>
<a id='line_647'>      and after this salutary lesson, the Mogul conqueror checked his</a>
<a id='line_648'>      pursuit, and turned aside to the invasion of Syria and Egypt. In</a>

<a id='line_712'>      the enemies, and detained the ambassadors, of the Mogul, who</a>
<a id='line_713'>      patiently expected his decease, to revenge the crimes of the</a>
<a id='line_714'>      father on the feeble reign of his son Farage. The Syrian emirs 34</a>

<a id='line_719'>      thousand villages; and instead of sustaining a siege, they threw</a>

<a id='line_725'>      Greek fire: the rapid evolutions of his cavalry completed the</a>

<a id='line_734'>      had taught him to revere the memory of Ali and Hosein; and he had</a>
<a id='line_735'>      imbibed a deep prejudice against the Syrians, as the enemies of</a>
<a id='line_736'>      the son of the daughter of the apostle of God. To these doctors</a>
<a id='line_737'>      he proposed a captious question, which the casuists of Bochara,</a>
<a id='line_738'>      Samarcand, and Herat, were incapable of resolving. “Who are the</a>
<a id='line_739'>      true martyrs, of those who are slain on my side, or on that of my</a>
<a id='line_740'>      enemies?” But he was silenced, or satisfied, by the dexterity of</a>
<a id='line_741'>      one of the cadhis of Aleppo, who replied in the words of Mahomet</a>
<a id='line_742'>      himself, that the motive, not the ensign, constitutes the martyr;</a>
<a id='line_743'>      and that the Moslems of either party, who fight only for the</a>
<a id='line_744'>      glory of God, may deserve that sacred appellation. The true</a>
<a id='line_745'>      succession of the caliphs was a controversy of a still more</a>
<a id='line_746'>      delicate nature; and the frankness of a doctor, too honest for</a>
<a id='line_747'>      his situation, provoked the emperor to exclaim, “Ye are as false</a>
<a id='line_748'>      as those of Damascus: Moawiyah was a usurper, Yezid a tyrant, and</a>
<a id='line_749'>      Ali alone is the lawful successor of the prophet.” A prudent</a>
<a id='line_750'>      explanation restored his tranquillity; and he passed to a more</a>
<a id='line_751'>      familiar topic of conversation. “What is your age?” said he to</a>
<a id='line_752'>      the cadhi. “Fifty years.”—“It would be the age of my eldest son:</a>
<a id='line_753'>      you see me here (continued Timour) a poor lame, decrepit mortal.</a>
<a id='line_754'>      Yet by my arm has the Almighty been pleased to subdue the</a>
<a id='line_755'>      kingdoms of Iran, Touran, and the Indies. I am not a man of</a>
<a id='line_756'>      blood; and God is my witness, that in all my wars I have never</a>
<a id='line_757'>      been the aggressor, and that my enemies have always been the</a>
<a id='line_758'>      authors of their own calamity.” During this peaceful conversation</a>
<a id='line_759'>      the streets of Aleppo streamed with blood, and reechoed with the</a>
<a id='line_760'>      cries of mothers and children, with the shrieks of violated</a>
<a id='line_761'>      virgins. The rich plunder that was abandoned to his soldiers</a>
<a id='line_762'>      might stimulate their avarice; but their cruelty was enforced by</a>
<a id='line_763'>      the peremptory command of producing an adequate number of heads,</a>
<a id='line_764'>      which, according to his custom, were curiously piled in columns</a>
<a id='line_765'>      and pyramids: the Moguls celebrated the feast of victory, while</a>
<a id='line_766'>      the surviving Moslems passed the night in tears and in chains. I</a>
<a id='line_767'>      shall not dwell on the march of the destroyer from Aleppo to</a>
<a id='line_768'>      Damascus, where he was rudely encountered, and almost overthrown,</a>
<a id='line_769'>      by the armies of Egypt. A retrograde motion was imputed to his</a>
<a id='line_770'>      distress and despair: one of his nephews deserted to the enemy;</a>
<a id='line_771'>      and Syria rejoiced in the tale of his defeat, when the sultan was</a>
<a id='line_772'>      driven by the revolt of the Mamalukes to escape with</a>
<a id='line_773'>      precipitation and shame to his palace of Cairo. Abandoned by</a>
<a id='line_774'>      their prince, the inhabitants of Damascus still defended their</a>
<a id='line_775'>      walls; and Timour consented to raise the siege, if they would</a>
<a id='line_776'>      adorn his retreat with a gift or ransom; each article of nine</a>
<a id='line_777'>      pieces. But no sooner had he introduced himself into the city,</a>
<a id='line_778'>      under color of a truce, than he perfidiously violated the treaty;</a>
<a id='line_779'>      imposed a contribution of ten millions of gold; and animated his</a>
<a id='line_780'>      troops to chastise the posterity of those Syrians who had</a>
<a id='line_781'>      executed, or approved, the murder of the grandson of Mahomet. A</a>
<a id='line_782'>      family which had given honorable burial to the head of Hosein,</a>
<a id='line_783'>      and a colony of artificers, whom he sent to labor at Samarcand,</a>
<a id='line_784'>      were alone reserved in the general massacre, and after a period</a>
<a id='line_785'>      of seven centuries, Damascus was reduced to ashes, because a</a>
<a id='line_786'>      Tartar was moved by religious zeal to avenge the blood of an</a>
<a id='line_787'>      Arab. The losses and fatigues of the campaign obliged Timour to</a>
<a id='line_788'>      renounce the conquest of Palestine and Egypt; but in his return</a>
<a id='line_789'>      to the Euphrates he delivered Aleppo to the flames; and justified</a>
<a id='line_790'>      his pious motive by the pardon and reward of two thousand</a>
<a id='line_791'>      sectaries of Ali, who were desirous to visit the tomb of his son.</a>
<a id='line_792'>      I have expatiated on the personal anecdotes which mark the</a>

<a id='line_794'>      he erected on the ruins of Bagdad a pyramid of ninety thousand</a>
<a id='line_795'>      heads; again visited Georgia; encamped on the banks of Araxes;</a>
<a id='line_796'>      and proclaimed his resolution of marching against the Ottoman</a>
<a id='line_797'>      emperor. Conscious of the importance of the war, he collected his</a>
<a id='line_798'>      forces from every province: eight hundred thousand men were</a>
<a id='line_799'>      enrolled on his military list; 37 but the splendid commands of</a>
<a id='line_800'>      five, and ten, thousand horse, may be rather expressive of the</a>
<a id='line_801'>      rank and pension of the chiefs, than of the genuine number of</a>
<a id='line_802'>      effective soldiers. 38 In the pillage of Syria, the Moguls had</a>
<a id='line_803'>      acquired immense riches: but the delivery of their pay and</a>
<a id='line_804'>      arrears for seven years more firmly attached them to the Imperial</a>

<a id='line_846'>      During this diversion of the Mogul arms, Bajazet had two years to</a>

<a id='line_848'>      of four hundred thousand horse and foot, 39 whose merit and</a>

<a id='line_851'>      forty thousand men; a national cavalry, the Spahis of modern</a>

<a id='line_853'>      impenetrable armor; the troops of Anatolia, whose princes had</a>
<a id='line_854'>      taken refuge in the camp of Timour, and a colony of Tartars, whom</a>
<a id='line_855'>      he had driven from Kipzak, and to whom Bajazet had assigned a</a>
<a id='line_856'>      settlement in the plains of Adrianople. The fearless confidence</a>
<a id='line_857'>      of the sultan urged him to meet his antagonist; and, as if he had</a>
<a id='line_858'>      chosen that spot for revenge, he displayed his banner near the</a>
<a id='line_859'>      ruins of the unfortunate Suvas. In the mean while, Timour moved</a>
<a id='line_860'>      from the Araxes through the countries of Armenia and Anatolia:</a>
<a id='line_861'>      his boldness was secured by the wisest precautions; his speed was</a>
<a id='line_862'>      guided by order and discipline; and the woods, the mountains, and</a>
<a id='line_863'>      the rivers, were diligently explored by the flying squadrons, who</a>
<a id='line_864'>      marked his road and preceded his standard. Firm in his plan of</a>
<a id='line_865'>      fighting in the heart of the Ottoman kingdom, he avoided their</a>
<a id='line_866'>      camp; dexterously inclined to the left; occupied Cæsarea;</a>
<a id='line_867'>      traversed the salt desert and the River Halys; and invested</a>
<a id='line_868'>      Angora: while the sultan, immovable and ignorant in his post,</a>
<a id='line_869'>      compared the Tartar swiftness to the crawling of a snail; 40 he</a>
<a id='line_870'>      returned on the wings of indignation to the relief of Angora: and</a>
<a id='line_871'>      as both generals were alike impatient for action, the plains</a>
<a id='line_872'>      round that city were the scene of a memorable battle, which has</a>
<a id='line_873'>      immortalized the glory of Timour and the shame of Bajazet. For</a>
<a id='line_874'>      this signal victory the Mogul emperor was indebted to himself, to</a>
<a id='line_875'>      the genius of the moment, and the discipline of thirty years. He</a>
<a id='line_876'>      had improved the tactics, without violating the manners, of his</a>
<a id='line_877'>      nation, 41 whose force still consisted in the missile weapons,</a>
<a id='line_878'>      and rapid evolutions, of a numerous cavalry. From a single troop</a>
<a id='line_879'>      to a great army, the mode of attack was the same: a foremost line</a>
<a id='line_880'>      first advanced to the charge, and was supported in a just order</a>
<a id='line_881'>      by the squadrons of the great vanguard. The general’s eye watched</a>
<a id='line_882'>      over the field, and at his command the front and rear of the</a>
<a id='line_883'>      right and left wings successively moved forwards in their several</a>
<a id='line_884'>      divisions, and in a direct or oblique line: the enemy was pressed</a>
<a id='line_885'>      by eighteen or twenty attacks; and each attack afforded a chance</a>
<a id='line_886'>      of victory. If they all proved fruitless or unsuccessful, the</a>
<a id='line_887'>      occasion was worthy of the emperor himself, who gave the signal</a>
<a id='line_888'>      of advancing to the standard and main body, which he led in</a>
<a id='line_889'>      person. 42 But in the battle of Angora, the main body itself was</a>
<a id='line_890'>      supported, on the flanks and in the rear, by the bravest</a>
<a id='line_891'>      squadrons of the reserve, commanded by the sons and grandsons of</a>
<a id='line_892'>      Timour. The conqueror of Hindostan ostentatiously showed a line</a>
<a id='line_893'>      of elephants, the trophies, rather than the instruments, of</a>
<a id='line_894'>      victory; the use of the Greek fire was familiar to the Moguls and</a>
<a id='line_895'>      Ottomans; but had they borrowed from Europe the recent invention</a>
<a id='line_896'>      of gunpowder and cannon, the artificial thunder, in the hands of</a>
<a id='line_897'>      either nation, must have turned the fortune of the day. 43 In</a>
<a id='line_898'>      that day Bajazet displayed the qualities of a soldier and a</a>
<a id='line_899'>      chief: but his genius sunk under a stronger ascendant; and, from</a>
<a id='line_900'>      various motives, the greatest part of his troops failed him in</a>
<a id='line_901'>      the decisive moment. His rigor and avarice 431 had provoked a</a>
<a id='line_902'>      mutiny among the Turks; and even his son Soliman too hastily</a>
<a id='line_903'>      withdrew from the field. The forces of Anatolia, loyal in their</a>
<a id='line_904'>      revolt, were drawn away to the banners of their lawful princes.</a>
<a id='line_905'>      His Tartar allies had been tempted by the letters and emissaries</a>
<a id='line_906'>      of Timour; 44 who reproached their ignoble servitude under the</a>
<a id='line_907'>      slaves of their fathers; and offered to their hopes the dominion</a>
<a id='line_908'>      of their new, or the liberty of their ancient, country. In the</a>
<a id='line_909'>      right wing of Bajazet the cuirassiers of Europe charged, with</a>
<a id='line_910'>      faithful hearts and irresistible arms: but these men of iron were</a>
<a id='line_911'>      soon broken by an artful flight and headlong pursuit; and the</a>
<a id='line_912'>      Janizaries, alone, without cavalry or missile weapons, were</a>
<a id='line_913'>      encompassed by the circle of the Mogul hunters. Their valor was</a>
<a id='line_914'>      at length oppressed by heat, thirst, and the weight of numbers;</a>
<a id='line_915'>      and the unfortunate sultan, afflicted with the gout in his hands</a>
<a id='line_916'>      and feet, was transported from the field on the fleetest of his</a>
<a id='line_917'>      horses. He was pursued and taken by the titular khan of Zagatai;</a>
<a id='line_918'>      and, after his capture, and the defeat of the Ottoman powers, the</a>
<a id='line_919'>      kingdom of Anatolia submitted to the conqueror, who planted his</a>
<a id='line_920'>      standard at Kiotahia, and dispersed on all sides the ministers of</a>
<a id='line_921'>      rapine and destruction. Mirza Mehemmed Sultan, the eldest and</a>
<a id='line_922'>      best beloved of his grandsons, was despatched to Boursa, with</a>
<a id='line_923'>      thirty thousand horse; and such was his youthful ardor, that he</a>
<a id='line_924'>      arrived with only four thousand at the gates of the capital,</a>
<a id='line_925'>      after performing in five days a march of two hundred and thirty</a>
<a id='line_926'>      miles. Yet fear is still more rapid in its course; and Soliman,</a>
<a id='line_927'>      the son of Bajazet, had already passed over to Europe with the</a>
<a id='line_928'>      royal treasure. The spoil, however, of the palace and city was</a>
<a id='line_929'>      immense: the inhabitants had escaped; but the buildings, for the</a>
<a id='line_930'>      most part of wood, were reduced to ashes. From Boursa, the</a>
<a id='line_931'>      grandson of Timour advanced to Nice, ever yet a fair and</a>
<a id='line_932'>      flourishing city; and the Mogul squadrons were only stopped by</a>
<a id='line_933'>      the waves of the Propontis. The same success attended the other</a>
<a id='line_934'>      mirzas and emirs in their excursions; and Smyrna, defended by the</a>
<a id='line_935'>      zeal and courage of the Rhodian knights, alone deserved the</a>
<a id='line_936'>      presence of the emperor himself. After an obstinate defence, the</a>
<a id='line_937'>      place was taken by storm: all that breathed was put to the sword;</a>
<a id='line_938'>      and the heads of the Christian heroes were launched from the</a>
<a id='line_939'>      engines, on board of two carracks, or great ships of Europe, that</a>
<a id='line_940'>      rode at anchor in the harbor. The Moslems of Asia rejoiced in</a>
<a id='line_941'>      their deliverance from a dangerous and domestic foe; and a</a>
<a id='line_942'>      parallel was drawn between the two rivals, by observing that</a>
<a id='line_943'>      Timour, in fourteen days, had reduced a fortress which had</a>

<a id='line_998'>      Timour informed that the captive Ottoman was at the door of his</a>

<a id='line_1003'>      web which you have woven, the thorns of the tree which yourself</a>

<a id='line_1010'>      shall express my gratitude to God by my clemency to man.” The</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      royal captive showed some signs of repentance, accepted the</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      humiliation of a robe of honor, and embraced with tears his son</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      Mousa, who, at his request, was sought and found among the</a>
<a id='line_1014'>      captives of the field. The Ottoman princes were lodged in a</a>
<a id='line_1015'>      splendid pavilion; and the respect of the guards could be</a>
<a id='line_1016'>      surpassed only by their vigilance. On the arrival of the harem</a>
<a id='line_1017'>      from Boursa, Timour restored the queen Despina and her daughter</a>
<a id='line_1018'>      to their father and husband; but he piously required, that the</a>

<a id='line_1048'>      chain of witnesses, some of whom shall be produced in the order</a>
<a id='line_1049'>      of their time and country. _1._ The reader has not forgot the</a>
<a id='line_1050'>      garrison of French, whom the marshal Boucicault left behind him</a>
<a id='line_1051'>      for the defence of Constantinople. They were on the spot to</a>

<a id='line_1057'>      historian, within the distance of seven years. 49 _2._ The name</a>
<a id='line_1058'>      of Poggius the Italian 50 is deservedly famous among the revivers</a>
<a id='line_1059'>      of learning in the fifteenth century. His elegant dialogue on the</a>
<a id='line_1060'>      vicissitudes of fortune 51 was composed in his fiftieth year,</a>
<a id='line_1061'>      twenty-eight years after the Turkish victory of Tamerlane; 52</a>
<a id='line_1062'>      whom he celebrates as not inferior to the illustrious Barbarians</a>
<a id='line_1063'>      of antiquity. Of his exploits and discipline Poggius was informed</a>
<a id='line_1064'>      by several ocular witnesses; nor does he forget an example so</a>
<a id='line_1065'>      apposite to his theme as the Ottoman monarch, whom the Scythian</a>
<a id='line_1066'>      confined like a wild beast in an iron cage, and exhibited a</a>
<a id='line_1067'>      spectacle to Asia. I might add the authority of two Italian</a>
<a id='line_1068'>      chronicles, perhaps of an earlier date, which would prove at</a>
<a id='line_1069'>      least that the same story, whether false or true, was imported</a>
<a id='line_1070'>      into Europe with the first tidings of the revolution. 53 _3._ At</a>
<a id='line_1071'>      the time when Poggius flourished at Rome, Ahmed Ebn Arabshah</a>
<a id='line_1072'>      composed at Damascus the florid and malevolent history of Timour,</a>
<a id='line_1073'>      for which he had collected materials in his journeys over Turkey</a>
<a id='line_1074'>      and Tartary. 54 Without any possible correspondence between the</a>
<a id='line_1075'>      Latin and the Arabian writer, they agree in the fact of the iron</a>
<a id='line_1076'>      cage; and their agreement is a striking proof of their common</a>
<a id='line_1077'>      veracity. Ahmed Arabshah likewise relates another outrage, which</a>
<a id='line_1078'>      Bajazet endured, of a more domestic and tender nature. His</a>
<a id='line_1079'>      indiscreet mention of women and divorces was deeply resented by</a>
<a id='line_1080'>      the jealous Tartar: in the feast of victory the wine was served</a>
<a id='line_1081'>      by female cupbearers, and the sultan beheld his own concubines</a>
<a id='line_1082'>      and wives confounded among the slaves, and exposed without a veil</a>
<a id='line_1083'>      to the eyes of intemperance. To escape a similar indignity, it is</a>
<a id='line_1084'>      said that his successors, except in a single instance, have</a>
<a id='line_1085'>      abstained from legitimate nuptials; and the Ottoman practice and</a>
<a id='line_1086'>      belief, at least in the sixteenth century, is asserted by the</a>
<a id='line_1087'>      observing Busbequius, 55 ambassador from the court of Vienna to</a>
<a id='line_1088'>      the great Soliman. _4._ Such is the separation of language, that</a>
<a id='line_1089'>      the testimony of a Greek is not less independent than that of a</a>
<a id='line_1090'>      Latin or an Arab. I suppress the names of Chalcondyles and Ducas,</a>

<a id='line_1215'>      Timour: his armies were invincible, his ambition was boundless,</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      and his zeal might aspire to conquer and convert the Christian</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      kingdoms of the West, which already trembled at his name. He</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      touched the utmost verge of the land; but an insuperable, though</a>
<a id='line_1219'>      narrow, sea rolled between the two continents of Europe and Asia;</a>
<a id='line_1220'>      59 and the lord of so many _tomans_, or myriads, of horse, was</a>
<a id='line_1221'>      not master of a single galley. The two passages of the Bosphorus</a>
<a id='line_1222'>      and Hellespont, of Constantinople and Gallipoli, were possessed,</a>
<a id='line_1223'>      the one by the Christians, the other by the Turks. On this great</a>
<a id='line_1224'>      occasion, they forgot the difference of religion, to act with</a>
<a id='line_1225'>      union and firmness in the common cause: the double straits were</a>
<a id='line_1226'>      guarded with ships and fortifications; and they separately</a>
<a id='line_1227'>      withheld the transports which Timour demanded of either nation,</a>
<a id='line_1228'>      under the pretence of attacking their enemy. At the same time,</a>
<a id='line_1229'>      they soothed his pride with tributary gifts and suppliant</a>
<a id='line_1230'>      embassies, and prudently tempted him to retreat with the honors</a>
<a id='line_1231'>      of victory. Soliman, the son of Bajazet, implored his clemency</a>
<a id='line_1232'>      for his father and himself; accepted, by a red patent, the</a>
<a id='line_1233'>      investiture of the kingdom of Romania, which he already held by</a>
<a id='line_1234'>      the sword; and reiterated his ardent wish, of casting himself in</a>
<a id='line_1235'>      person at the feet of the king of the world. The Greek emperor 60</a>
<a id='line_1236'>      (either John or Manuel) submitted to pay the same tribute which</a>
<a id='line_1237'>      he had stipulated with the Turkish sultan, and ratified the</a>
<a id='line_1238'>      treaty by an oath of allegiance, from which he could absolve his</a>
<a id='line_1239'>      conscience so soon as the Mogul arms had retired from Anatolia.</a>
<a id='line_1240'>      But the fears and fancy of nations ascribed to the ambitious</a>
<a id='line_1241'>      Tamerlane a new design of vast and romantic compass; a design of</a>
<a id='line_1242'>      subduing Egypt and Africa, marching from the Nile to the Atlantic</a>
<a id='line_1243'>      Ocean, entering Europe by the Straits of Gibraltar, and, after</a>
<a id='line_1244'>      imposing his yoke on the kingdoms of Christendom, of returning</a>
<a id='line_1245'>      home by the deserts of Russia and Tartary. This remote, and</a>
<a id='line_1246'>      perhaps imaginary, danger was averted by the submission of the</a>
<a id='line_1247'>      sultan of Egypt: the honors of the prayer and the coin attested</a>
<a id='line_1248'>      at Cairo the supremacy of Timour; and a rare gift of a _giraffe_,</a>
<a id='line_1249'>      or camelopard, and nine ostriches, represented at Samarcand the</a>
<a id='line_1250'>      tribute of the African world. Our imagination is not less</a>
<a id='line_1251'>      astonished by the portrait of a Mogul, who, in his camp before</a>
<a id='line_1252'>      Smyrna, meditates, and almost accomplishes, the invasion of the</a>
<a id='line_1253'>      Chinese empire. 61 Timour was urged to this enterprise by</a>
<a id='line_1254'>      national honor and religious zeal. The torrents which he had shed</a>
<a id='line_1255'>      of Mussulman blood could be expiated only by an equal destruction</a>
<a id='line_1256'>      of the infidels; and as he now stood at the gates of paradise, he</a>
<a id='line_1257'>      might best secure his glorious entrance by demolishing the idols</a>
<a id='line_1258'>      of China, founding mosques in every city, and establishing the</a>
<a id='line_1259'>      profession of faith in one God, and his prophet Mahomet. The</a>
<a id='line_1260'>      recent expulsion of the house of Zingis was an insult on the</a>
<a id='line_1261'>      Mogul name; and the disorders of the empire afforded the fairest</a>
<a id='line_1262'>      opportunity for revenge. The illustrious Hongvou, founder of the</a>
<a id='line_1263'>      dynasty of _Ming_, died four years before the battle of Angora;</a>
<a id='line_1264'>      and his grandson, a weak and unfortunate youth, was burnt in his</a>
<a id='line_1265'>      palace, after a million of Chinese had perished in the civil war.</a>
<a id='line_1266'>      62 Before he evacuated Anatolia, Timour despatched beyond the</a>
<a id='line_1267'>      Sihoon a numerous army, or rather colony, of his old and new</a>
<a id='line_1268'>      subjects, to open the road, to subdue the Pagan Calmucks and</a>
<a id='line_1269'>      Mungals, and to found cities and magazines in the desert; and, by</a>
<a id='line_1270'>      the diligence of his lieutenant, he soon received a perfect map</a>
<a id='line_1271'>      and description of the unknown regions, from the source of the</a>
<a id='line_1272'>      Irtish to the wall of China. During these preparations, the</a>

<a id='line_1274'>      on the banks of the Araxes; appeased the troubles of Persia; and</a>

<a id='line_1319'>      tents and pavilions, which displayed the luxury of a great city</a>
<a id='line_1320'>      and the spoils of a victorious camp. Whole forests were cut down</a>
<a id='line_1321'>      to supply fuel for the kitchens; the plain was spread with</a>
<a id='line_1322'>      pyramids of meat, and vases of every liquor, to which thousands</a>
<a id='line_1323'>      of guests were courteously invited: the orders of the state, and</a>

<a id='line_1325'>      nor were the ambassadors of Europe (says the haughty Persian)</a>
<a id='line_1326'>      excluded from the feast; since even the _casses_, the smallest of</a>

<a id='line_1328'>      testified by illuminations and masquerades; the trades of</a>
<a id='line_1329'>      Samarcand passed in review; and every trade was emulous to</a>
<a id='line_1330'>      execute some quaint device, some marvellous pageant, with the</a>
<a id='line_1331'>      materials of their peculiar art. After the marriage contracts had</a>

<a id='line_1333'>      retired to the nuptial chambers: nine times, according to the</a>
<a id='line_1334'>      Asiatic fashion, they were dressed and undressed; and at each</a>
<a id='line_1335'>      change of apparel, pearls and rubies were showered on their</a>
<a id='line_1336'>      heads, and contemptuously abandoned to their attendants. A</a>
<a id='line_1337'>      general indulgence was proclaimed: every law was relaxed, every</a>
<a id='line_1338'>      pleasure was allowed; the people was free, the sovereign was</a>
<a id='line_1339'>      idle; and the historian of Timour may remark, that, after</a>
<a id='line_1340'>      devoting fifty years to the attainment of empire, the only happy</a>
<a id='line_1341'>      period of his life were the two months in which he ceased to</a>
<a id='line_1342'>      exercise his power. But he was soon awakened to the cares of</a>
<a id='line_1343'>      government and war. The standard was unfurled for the invasion of</a>
<a id='line_1344'>      China: the emirs made their report of two hundred thousand, the</a>
<a id='line_1345'>      select and veteran soldiers of Iran and Touran: their baggage and</a>
<a id='line_1346'>      provisions were transported by five hundred great wagons, and an</a>
<a id='line_1347'>      immense train of horses and camels; and the troops might prepare</a>
<a id='line_1348'>      for a long absence, since more than six months were employed in</a>
<a id='line_1349'>      the tranquil journey of a caravan from Samarcand to Pekin.</a>
<a id='line_1350'>      Neither age, nor the severity of the winter, could retard the</a>
<a id='line_1351'>      impatience of Timour; he mounted on horseback, passed the Sihoon</a>
<a id='line_1352'>      on the ice, marched seventy-six parasangs, three hundred miles,</a>
<a id='line_1353'>      from his capital, and pitched his last camp in the neighborhood</a>
<a id='line_1354'>      of Otrar, where he was expected by the angel of death. Fatigue,</a>
<a id='line_1355'>      and the indiscreet use of iced water, accelerated the progress of</a>
<a id='line_1356'>      his fever; and the conqueror of Asia expired in the seventieth</a>
<a id='line_1357'>      year of his age, thirty-five years after he had ascended the</a>
<a id='line_1358'>      throne of Zagatai. His designs were lost; his armies were</a>
<a id='line_1359'>      disbanded; China was saved; and fourteen years after his decease,</a>

<a id='line_1383'>      The fame of Timour has pervaded the East and West: his posterity</a>
<a id='line_1384'>      is still invested with the Imperial _title_; and the admiration</a>
<a id='line_1385'>      of his subjects, who revered him almost as a deity, may be</a>
<a id='line_1386'>      justified in some degree by the praise or confession of his</a>
<a id='line_1387'>      bitterest enemies. 66 Although he was lame of a hand and foot,</a>
<a id='line_1388'>      his form and stature were not unworthy of his rank; and his</a>
<a id='line_1389'>      vigorous health, so essential to himself and to the world, was</a>
<a id='line_1390'>      corroborated by temperance and exercise. In his familiar</a>
<a id='line_1391'>      discourse he was grave and modest, and if he was ignorant of the</a>
<a id='line_1392'>      Arabic language, he spoke with fluency and elegance the Persian</a>
<a id='line_1393'>      and Turkish idioms. It was his delight to converse with the</a>
<a id='line_1394'>      learned on topics of history and science; and the amusement of</a>
<a id='line_1395'>      his leisure hours was the game of chess, which he improved or</a>
<a id='line_1396'>      corrupted with new refinements. 67 In his religion he was a</a>
<a id='line_1397'>      zealous, though not perhaps an orthodox, Mussulman; 68 but his</a>
<a id='line_1398'>      sound understanding may tempt us to believe, that a superstitious</a>
<a id='line_1399'>      reverence for omens and prophecies, for saints and astrologers,</a>
<a id='line_1400'>      was only affected as an instrument of policy. In the government</a>
<a id='line_1401'>      of a vast empire, he stood alone and absolute, without a rebel to</a>
<a id='line_1402'>      oppose his power, a favorite to seduce his affections, or a</a>
<a id='line_1403'>      minister to mislead his judgment. It was his firmest maxim, that</a>
<a id='line_1404'>      whatever might be the consequence, the word of the prince should</a>
<a id='line_1405'>      never be disputed or recalled; but his foes have maliciously</a>
<a id='line_1406'>      observed, that the commands of anger and destruction were more</a>
<a id='line_1407'>      strictly executed than those of beneficence and favor. His sons</a>
<a id='line_1408'>      and grandsons, of whom Timour left six-and-thirty at his decease,</a>
<a id='line_1409'>      were his first and most submissive subjects; and whenever they</a>
<a id='line_1410'>      deviated from their duty, they were corrected, according to the</a>
<a id='line_1411'>      laws of Zingis, with the bastinade, and afterwards restored to</a>
<a id='line_1412'>      honor and command. Perhaps his heart was not devoid of the social</a>
<a id='line_1413'>      virtues; perhaps he was not incapable of loving his friends and</a>
<a id='line_1414'>      pardoning his enemies; but the rules of morality are founded on</a>
<a id='line_1415'>      the public interest; and it may be sufficient to applaud the</a>
<a id='line_1416'>      _wisdom_ of a monarch, for the liberality by which he is not</a>
<a id='line_1417'>      impoverished, and for the justice by which he is strengthened and</a>
<a id='line_1418'>      enriched. To maintain the harmony of authority and obedience, to</a>
<a id='line_1419'>      chastise the proud, to protect the weak, to reward the deserving,</a>
<a id='line_1420'>      to banish vice and idleness from his dominions, to secure the</a>
<a id='line_1421'>      traveller and merchant, to restrain the depredations of the</a>
<a id='line_1422'>      soldier, to cherish the labors of the husbandman, to encourage</a>
<a id='line_1423'>      industry and learning, and, by an equal and moderate assessment,</a>
<a id='line_1424'>      to increase the revenue, without increasing the taxes, are indeed</a>
<a id='line_1425'>      the duties of a prince; but, in the discharge of these duties, he</a>
<a id='line_1426'>      finds an ample and immediate recompense. Timour might boast,</a>
<a id='line_1427'>      that, at his accession to the throne, Asia was the prey of</a>
<a id='line_1428'>      anarchy and rapine, whilst under his prosperous monarchy a child,</a>
<a id='line_1429'>      fearless and unhurt, might carry a purse of gold from the East to</a>
<a id='line_1430'>      the West. Such was his confidence of merit, that from this</a>
<a id='line_1431'>      reformation he derived an excuse for his victories, and a title</a>
<a id='line_1432'>      to universal dominion. The four following observations will serve</a>
<a id='line_1433'>      to appreciate his claim to the public gratitude; and perhaps we</a>
<a id='line_1434'>      shall conclude, that the Mogul emperor was rather the scourge</a>
<a id='line_1435'>      than the benefactor of mankind. _1._ If some partial disorders,</a>
<a id='line_1436'>      some local oppressions, were healed by the sword of Timour, the</a>
<a id='line_1437'>      remedy was far more pernicious than the disease. By their rapine,</a>
<a id='line_1438'>      cruelty, and discord, the petty tyrants of Persia might afflict</a>
<a id='line_1439'>      their subjects; but whole nations were crushed under the</a>
<a id='line_1440'>      footsteps of the reformer. The ground which had been occupied by</a>
<a id='line_1441'>      flourishing cities was often marked by his abominable trophies,</a>
<a id='line_1442'>      by columns, or pyramids, of human heads. Astracan, Carizme,</a>
<a id='line_1443'>      Delhi, Ispahan, Bagdad, Aleppo, Damascus, Boursa, Smyrna, and a</a>
<a id='line_1444'>      thousand others, were sacked, or burnt, or utterly destroyed, in</a>
<a id='line_1445'>      his presence, and by his troops: and perhaps his conscience would</a>
<a id='line_1446'>      have been startled, if a priest or philosopher had dared to</a>
<a id='line_1447'>      number the millions of victims whom he had sacrificed to the</a>
<a id='line_1448'>      establishment of peace and order. 69 _2._ His most destructive</a>
<a id='line_1449'>      wars were rather inroads than conquests. He invaded Turkestan,</a>
<a id='line_1450'>      Kipzak, Russia, Hindostan, Syria, Anatolia, Armenia, and Georgia,</a>
<a id='line_1451'>      without a hope or a desire of preserving those distant provinces.</a>
<a id='line_1452'>      From thence he departed laden with spoil; but he left behind him</a>
<a id='line_1453'>      neither troops to awe the contumacious, nor magistrates to</a>

<a id='line_1460'>      his family. But his peaceful labors were often interrupted, and</a>
<a id='line_1461'>      sometimes blasted, by the absence of the conqueror. While he</a>
<a id='line_1462'>      triumphed on the Volga or the Ganges, his servants, and even his</a>
<a id='line_1463'>      sons, forgot their master and their duty. The public and private</a>
<a id='line_1464'>      injuries were poorly redressed by the tardy rigor of inquiry and</a>
<a id='line_1465'>      punishment; and we must be content to praise the _Institutions_</a>
<a id='line_1466'>      of Timour, as the specious idea of a perfect monarchy. _4._</a>
<a id='line_1467'>      Whatsoever might be the blessings of his administration, they</a>
<a id='line_1468'>      evaporated with his life. To reign, rather than to govern, was</a>
<a id='line_1469'>      the ambition of his children and grandchildren; 70 the enemies of</a>
<a id='line_1470'>      each other and of the people. A fragment of the empire was upheld</a>
<a id='line_1471'>      with some glory by Sharokh, his youngest son; but after _his_</a>
<a id='line_1472'>      decease, the scene was again involved in darkness and blood; and</a>
<a id='line_1473'>      before the end of a century, Transoxiana and Persia were trampled</a>
<a id='line_1474'>      by the Uzbeks from the north, and the Turkmans of the black and</a>

<a id='line_1531'>      doubtful, whether I relate the story of the true _Mustapha_, or</a>
<a id='line_1532'>      of an impostor who personated that lost prince. He fought by his</a>
<a id='line_1533'>      father’s side in the battle of Angora: but when the captive</a>
<a id='line_1534'>      sultan was permitted to inquire for his children, Mousa alone</a>
<a id='line_1535'>      could be found; and the Turkish historians, the slaves of the</a>
<a id='line_1536'>      triumphant faction, are persuaded that his brother was confounded</a>
<a id='line_1537'>      among the slain. If Mustapha escaped from that disastrous field,</a>
<a id='line_1538'>      he was concealed twelve years from his friends and enemies; till</a>
<a id='line_1539'>      he emerged in Thessaly, and was hailed by a numerous party, as</a>
<a id='line_1540'>      the son and successor of Bajazet. His first defeat would have</a>
<a id='line_1541'>      been his last, had not the true, or false, Mustapha been saved by</a>
<a id='line_1542'>      the Greeks, and restored, after the decease of his brother</a>
<a id='line_1543'>      Mahomet, to liberty and empire. A degenerate mind seemed to argue</a>
<a id='line_1544'>      his spurious birth; and if, on the throne of Adrianople, he was</a>
<a id='line_1545'>      adored as the Ottoman sultan, his flight, his fetters, and an</a>
<a id='line_1546'>      ignominious gibbet, delivered the impostor to popular contempt. A</a>
<a id='line_1547'>      similar character and claim was asserted by several rival</a>
<a id='line_1548'>      pretenders: thirty persons are said to have suffered under the</a>
<a id='line_1549'>      name of Mustapha; and these frequent executions may perhaps</a>
<a id='line_1550'>      insinuate, that the Turkish court was not perfectly secure of the</a>
<a id='line_1551'>      death of the lawful prince. _2._ After his father’s captivity,</a>
<a id='line_1552'>      Isa 73 reigned for some time in the neighborhood of Angora,</a>
<a id='line_1553'>      Sinope, and the Black Sea; and his ambassadors were dismissed</a>
<a id='line_1554'>      from the presence of Timour with fair promises and honorable</a>
<a id='line_1555'>      gifts. But their master was soon deprived of his province and</a>
<a id='line_1556'>      life, by a jealous brother, the sovereign of Amasia; and the</a>
<a id='line_1557'>      final event suggested a pious allusion, that the law of Moses and</a>
<a id='line_1558'>      Jesus, of _Isa_ and _Mousa_, had been abrogated by the greater</a>
<a id='line_1559'>      Mahomet. _3._ _Soliman_ is not numbered in the list of the</a>
<a id='line_1560'>      Turkish emperors: yet he checked the victorious progress of the</a>
<a id='line_1561'>      Moguls; and after their departure, united for a while the thrones</a>
<a id='line_1562'>      of Adrianople and Boursa. In war he was brave, active, and</a>
<a id='line_1563'>      fortunate; his courage was softened by clemency; but it was</a>
<a id='line_1564'>      likewise inflamed by presumption, and corrupted by intemperance</a>
<a id='line_1565'>      and idleness. He relaxed the nerves of discipline, in a</a>
<a id='line_1566'>      government where either the subject or the sovereign must</a>
<a id='line_1567'>      continually tremble: his vices alienated the chiefs of the army</a>
<a id='line_1568'>      and the law; and his daily drunkenness, so contemptible in a</a>
<a id='line_1569'>      prince and a man, was doubly odious in a disciple of the prophet.</a>
<a id='line_1570'>      In the slumber of intoxication he was surprised by his brother</a>
<a id='line_1571'>      Mousa; and as he fled from Adrianople towards the Byzantine</a>
<a id='line_1572'>      capital, Soliman was overtaken and slain in a bath, 731 after a</a>
<a id='line_1573'>      reign of seven years and ten months. _4._ The investiture of</a>
<a id='line_1574'>      Mousa degraded him as the slave of the Moguls: his tributary</a>
<a id='line_1575'>      kingdom of Anatolia was confined within a narrow limit, nor could</a>
<a id='line_1576'>      his broken militia and empty treasury contend with the hardy and</a>
<a id='line_1577'>      veteran bands of the sovereign of Romania. Mousa fled in disguise</a>
<a id='line_1578'>      from the palace of Boursa; traversed the Propontis in an open</a>
<a id='line_1579'>      boat; wandered over the Walachian and Servian hills; and after</a>
<a id='line_1580'>      some vain attempts, ascended the throne of Adrianople, so</a>
<a id='line_1581'>      recently stained with the blood of Soliman. In a reign of three</a>
<a id='line_1582'>      years and a half, his troops were victorious against the</a>
<a id='line_1583'>      Christians of Hungary and the Morea; but Mousa was ruined by his</a>
<a id='line_1584'>      timorous disposition and unseasonable clemency. After resigning</a>
<a id='line_1585'>      the sovereignty of Anatolia, he fell a victim to the perfidy of</a>
<a id='line_1586'>      his ministers, and the superior ascendant of his brother Mahomet.</a>
<a id='line_1587'>      _5._The final victory of Mahomet was the just recompense of his</a>
<a id='line_1588'>      prudence and moderation. Before his father’s captivity, the royal</a>
<a id='line_1589'>      youth had been intrusted with the government of Amasia, thirty</a>
<a id='line_1590'>      days’ journey from Constantinople, and the Turkish frontier</a>
<a id='line_1591'>      against the Christians of Trebizond and Georgia. The castle, in</a>
<a id='line_1592'>      Asiatic warfare, was esteemed impregnable; and the city of</a>
<a id='line_1593'>      Amasia, 74 which is equally divided by the River Iris, rises on</a>
<a id='line_1594'>      either side in the form of an amphitheatre, and represents on a</a>
<a id='line_1595'>      smaller scale the image of Bagdad. In his rapid career, Timour</a>
<a id='line_1596'>      appears to have overlooked this obscure and contumacious angle of</a>
<a id='line_1597'>      Anatolia; and Mahomet, without provoking the conqueror,</a>
<a id='line_1598'>      maintained his silent independence, and chased from the province</a>
<a id='line_1599'>      the last stragglers of the Tartar host. 741 He relieved himself</a>
<a id='line_1600'>      from the dangerous neighborhood of Isa; but in the contests of</a>
<a id='line_1601'>      their more powerful brethren his firm neutrality was respected;</a>
<a id='line_1602'>      till, after the triumph of Mousa, he stood forth the heir and</a>
<a id='line_1603'>      avenger of the unfortunate Soliman. Mahomet obtained Anatolia by</a>
<a id='line_1604'>      treaty, and Romania by arms; and the soldier who presented him</a>
<a id='line_1605'>      with the head of Mousa was rewarded as the benefactor of his king</a>
<a id='line_1606'>      and country. The eight years of his sole and peaceful reign were</a>
<a id='line_1607'>      usefully employed in banishing the vices of civil discord, and</a>
<a id='line_1608'>      restoring on a firmer basis the fabric of the Ottoman monarchy.</a>
<a id='line_1609'>      His last care was the choice of two viziers, Bajazet and Ibrahim,</a>
<a id='line_1610'>      75 who might guide the youth of his son Amurath; and such was</a>
<a id='line_1611'>      their union and prudence, that they concealed above forty days</a>

<a id='line_1715'>      dismissed his blind competitor to an easy exile in the Isle of</a>
<a id='line_1716'>      Lesbos. The ambassadors of the son of Bajazet were soon</a>

<a id='line_1718'>      tone was modest: they were awed by the just apprehension, lest</a>
<a id='line_1719'>      the Greeks should open to the Moguls the gates of Europe. Soliman</a>

<a id='line_1724'>      the Propontis, and the Black Sea. The alliance of Soliman exposed</a>
<a id='line_1725'>      the emperor to the enmity and revenge of Mousa: the Turks</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      appeared in arms before the gates of Constantinople; but they</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      were repulsed by sea and land; and unless the city was guarded by</a>

<a id='line_1729'>      own triumph. But, instead of prolonging the division of the</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      Ottoman powers, the policy or passion of Manuel was tempted to</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      assist the most formidable of the sons of Bajazet. He concluded a</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      treaty with Mahomet, whose progress was checked by the</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      insuperable barrier of Gallipoli: the sultan and his troops were</a>

<a id='line_1736'>      conquest of Romania. The ruin was suspended by the prudence and</a>
<a id='line_1737'>      moderation of the conqueror: he faithfully discharged his own</a>
<a id='line_1738'>      obligations and those of Soliman, respected the laws of gratitude</a>
<a id='line_1739'>      and peace; and left the emperor guardian of his two younger sons,</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      in the vain hope of saving them from the jealous cruelty of their</a>

<a id='line_1911'>      bodies were exercised by every labor that could fortify their</a>
<a id='line_1912'>      strength; they learned to wrestle, to leap, to run, to shoot with</a>

<a id='line_1923'>      to the study of the Koran, and the knowledge of the Arabic and</a>
<a id='line_1924'>      Persian tongues. As they advanced in seniority and merit, they</a>
<a id='line_1925'>      were gradually dismissed to military, civil, and even</a>

<a id='line_1936'>      enfranchisement, they found themselves in an important office,</a>
<a id='line_1937'>      without faction or friendship, without parents and without heirs,</a>
<a id='line_1938'>      dependent on the hand which had raised them from the dust, and</a>
<a id='line_1939'>      which, on the slightest displeasure, could break in pieces these</a>
<a id='line_1940'>      statues of glass, as they were aptly termed by the Turkish</a>
<a id='line_1941'>      proverb. 89 In the slow and painful steps of education, their</a>
<a id='line_1942'>      characters and talents were unfolded to a discerning eye: the</a>
<a id='line_1943'>      _man_, naked and alone, was reduced to the standard of his</a>
<a id='line_1944'>      personal merit; and, if the sovereign had wisdom to choose, he</a>
<a id='line_1945'>      possessed a pure and boundless liberty of choice. The Ottoman</a>
<a id='line_1946'>      candidates were trained by the virtues of abstinence to those of</a>
<a id='line_1947'>      action; by the habits of submission to those of command. A</a>
<a id='line_1948'>      similar spirit was diffused among the troops; and their silence</a>
<a id='line_1949'>      and sobriety, their patience and modesty, have extorted the</a>
<a id='line_1950'>      reluctant praise of their Christian enemies. 90 Nor can the</a>
<a id='line_1951'>      victory appear doubtful, if we compare the discipline and</a>
<a id='line_1952'>      exercise of the Janizaries with the pride of birth, the</a>
<a id='line_1953'>      independence of chivalry, the ignorance of the new levies, the</a>
<a id='line_1954'>      mutinous temper of the veterans, and the vices of intemperance</a>

<a id='line_1975'>      The only hope of salvation for the Greek empire, and the adjacent</a>
<a id='line_1976'>      kingdoms, would have been some more powerful weapon, some</a>
<a id='line_1977'>      discovery in the art of war, that would give them a decisive</a>
<a id='line_1978'>      superiority over their Turkish foes. Such a weapon was in their</a>
<a id='line_1979'>      hands; such a discovery had been made in the critical moment of</a>
<a id='line_1980'>      their fate. The chemists of China or Europe had found, by casual</a>
<a id='line_1981'>      or elaborate experiments, that a mixture of saltpetre, sulphur,</a>
<a id='line_1982'>      and charcoal, produces, with a spark of fire, a tremendous</a>
<a id='line_1983'>      explosion. It was soon observed, that if the expansive force were</a>
<a id='line_1984'>      compressed in a strong tube, a ball of stone or iron might be</a>
<a id='line_1985'>      expelled with irresistible and destructive velocity. The precise</a>
<a id='line_1986'>      æra of the invention and application of gunpowder 91 is involved</a>
<a id='line_1987'>      in doubtful traditions and equivocal language; yet we may clearly</a>
<a id='line_1988'>      discern, that it was known before the middle of the fourteenth</a>
<a id='line_1989'>      century; and that before the end of the same, the use of</a>
<a id='line_1990'>      artillery in battles and sieges, by sea and land, was familiar to</a>
<a id='line_1991'>      the states of Germany, Italy, Spain, France, and England. 92 The</a>
<a id='line_1992'>      priority of nations is of small account; none could derive any</a>
<a id='line_1993'>      exclusive benefit from their previous or superior knowledge; and</a>
<a id='line_1994'>      in the common improvement, they stood on the same level of</a>
<a id='line_1995'>      relative power and military science. Nor was it possible to</a>
<a id='line_1996'>      circumscribe the secret within the pale of the church; it was</a>
<a id='line_1997'>      disclosed to the Turks by the treachery of apostates and the</a>
<a id='line_1998'>      selfish policy of rivals; and the sultans had sense to adopt, and</a>
<a id='line_1999'>      wealth to reward, the talents of a Christian engineer. The</a>
<a id='line_2000'>      Genoese, who transported Amurath into Europe, must be accused as</a>
<a id='line_2001'>      his preceptors; and it was probably by their hands that his</a>
<a id='line_2002'>      cannon was cast and directed at the siege of Constantinople. 93</a>
<a id='line_2003'>      The first attempt was indeed unsuccessful; but in the general</a>
<a id='line_2004'>      warfare of the age, the advantage was on _their_ side, who were</a>
<a id='line_2005'>      most commonly the assailants: for a while the proportion of the</a>
<a id='line_2006'>      attack and defence was suspended; and this thundering artillery</a>
<a id='line_2007'>      was pointed against the walls and towers which had been erected</a>
<a id='line_2008'>      only to resist the less potent engines of antiquity. By the</a>
<a id='line_2009'>      Venetians, the use of gunpowder was communicated without reproach</a>
<a id='line_2010'>      to the sultans of Egypt and Persia, their allies against the</a>
<a id='line_2011'>      Ottoman power; the secret was soon propagated to the extremities</a>
<a id='line_2012'>      of Asia; and the advantage of the European was confined to his</a>
<a id='line_2013'>      easy victories over the savages of the new world. If we contrast</a>
