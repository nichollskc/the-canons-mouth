<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; 1:2 To</a>
<a id='line_4'>know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;</a>
<a id='line_5'>1:3 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, and</a>
<a id='line_6'>equity; 1:4 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge</a>
<a id='line_7'>and discretion.</a>
<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>1:5 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of</a>
<a id='line_10'>understanding shall attain unto wise counsels: 1:6 To understand a</a>
<a id='line_11'>proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark</a>
<a id='line_12'>sayings.</a>
<a id='line_13'></a>
<a id='line_14'>1:7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools</a>
<a id='line_15'>despise wisdom and instruction.</a>
<a id='line_16'></a>
<a id='line_17'>1:8 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the</a>
<a id='line_18'>law of thy mother: 1:9 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy</a>
<a id='line_19'>head, and chains about thy neck.</a>
<a id='line_20'></a>
<a id='line_21'>1:10 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.</a>
<a id='line_22'></a>
<a id='line_23'>1:11 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk</a>
<a id='line_24'>privily for the innocent without cause: 1:12 Let us swallow them up</a>
<a id='line_25'>alive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:</a>
<a id='line_26'>1:13 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses</a>
<a id='line_27'>with spoil: 1:14 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:</a>
<a id='line_28'>1:15 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from</a>
<a id='line_29'>their path: 1:16 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed</a>
<a id='line_30'>blood.</a>
<a id='line_31'></a>
<a id='line_32'>1:17 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.</a>
<a id='line_33'></a>
<a id='line_34'>1:18 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for</a>
<a id='line_35'>their own lives.</a>
<a id='line_36'></a>
<a id='line_37'>1:19 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which taketh</a>
<a id='line_38'>away the life of the owners thereof.</a>
<a id='line_39'></a>
<a id='line_40'>1:20 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:</a>
<a id='line_41'>1:21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of</a>
<a id='line_42'>the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, 1:22 How long,</a>
<a id='line_43'>ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in</a>
<a id='line_44'>their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?  1:23 Turn you at my</a>
<a id='line_45'>reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known</a>
<a id='line_46'>my words unto you.</a>
<a id='line_47'></a>
<a id='line_48'>1:24 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my</a>
<a id='line_49'>hand, and no man regarded; 1:25 But ye have set at nought all my</a>
<a id='line_50'>counsel, and would none of my reproof: 1:26 I also will laugh at your</a>
<a id='line_51'>calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; 1:27 When your fear</a>
<a id='line_52'>cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when</a>
<a id='line_53'>distress and anguish cometh upon you.</a>
<a id='line_54'></a>
<a id='line_55'>1:28 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall</a>
<a id='line_56'>seek me early, but they shall not find me: 1:29 For that they hated</a>
<a id='line_57'>knowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: 1:30 They would</a>
<a id='line_58'>none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.</a>
<a id='line_59'></a>
<a id='line_60'>1:31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be</a>
<a id='line_61'>filled with their own devices.</a>
<a id='line_62'></a>
<a id='line_63'>1:32 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the</a>
<a id='line_64'>prosperity of fools shall destroy them.</a>
<a id='line_65'></a>
<a id='line_66'>1:33 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be</a>
<a id='line_67'>quiet from fear of evil.</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>2:1 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments</a>
<a id='line_70'>with thee; 2:2 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply</a>
<a id='line_71'>thine heart to understanding; 2:3 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge,</a>
<a id='line_72'>and liftest up thy voice for understanding; 2:4 If thou seekest her as</a>
<a id='line_73'>silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; 2:5 Then shalt</a>
<a id='line_74'>thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.</a>
<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>2:6 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and</a>
<a id='line_77'>understanding.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>2:7 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to</a>
<a id='line_80'>them that walk uprightly.</a>
<a id='line_81'></a>
<a id='line_82'>2:8 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his</a>
<a id='line_83'>saints.</a>
<a id='line_84'></a>
<a id='line_85'>2:9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and</a>
<a id='line_86'>equity; yea, every good path.</a>
<a id='line_87'></a>
<a id='line_88'>2:10 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasant</a>
<a id='line_89'>unto thy soul; 2:11 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding</a>
<a id='line_90'>shall keep thee: 2:12 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man,</a>
<a id='line_91'>from the man that speaketh froward things; 2:13 Who leave the paths of</a>
<a id='line_92'>uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; 2:14 Who rejoice to do</a>
<a id='line_93'>evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked; 2:15 Whose ways</a>
<a id='line_94'>are crooked, and they froward in their paths: 2:16 To deliver thee</a>
<a id='line_95'>from the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth with</a>
<a id='line_96'>her words; 2:17 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth</a>
<a id='line_97'>the covenant of her God.</a>
<a id='line_98'></a>
<a id='line_99'>2:18 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.</a>
<a id='line_100'></a>
<a id='line_101'>2:19 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of the</a>
<a id='line_102'>paths of life.</a>
<a id='line_103'></a>
<a id='line_104'>2:20 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths</a>
<a id='line_105'>of the righteous.</a>
<a id='line_106'></a>
<a id='line_107'>2:21 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall</a>
<a id='line_108'>remain in it.</a>
<a id='line_109'></a>
<a id='line_110'>2:22 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the</a>
<a id='line_111'>transgressors shall be rooted out of it.</a>
<a id='line_112'></a>
<a id='line_113'>3:1 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my</a>
<a id='line_114'>commandments: 3:2 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall</a>
<a id='line_115'>they add to thee.</a>
<a id='line_116'></a>
<a id='line_117'>3:3 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck;</a>
<a id='line_118'>write them upon the table of thine heart: 3:4 So shalt thou find</a>
<a id='line_119'>favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.</a>
<a id='line_120'></a>
<a id='line_121'>3:5 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine</a>
<a id='line_122'>own understanding.</a>
<a id='line_123'></a>
<a id='line_124'>3:6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.</a>
<a id='line_125'></a>
<a id='line_126'>3:7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from</a>
<a id='line_127'>evil.</a>
<a id='line_128'></a>
<a id='line_129'>3:8 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.</a>
<a id='line_130'></a>
<a id='line_131'>3:9 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of</a>
<a id='line_132'>all thine increase: 3:10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and</a>
<a id='line_133'>thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</a>
<a id='line_134'></a>
<a id='line_135'>3:11 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be weary</a>
<a id='line_136'>of his correction: 3:12 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even</a>
<a id='line_137'>as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</a>
<a id='line_138'></a>
<a id='line_139'>3:13 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth</a>
<a id='line_140'>understanding.</a>
<a id='line_141'></a>
<a id='line_142'>3:14 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of</a>
<a id='line_143'>silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.</a>
<a id='line_144'></a>
<a id='line_145'>3:15 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst</a>
<a id='line_146'>desire are not to be compared unto her.</a>
<a id='line_147'></a>
<a id='line_148'>3:16 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches</a>
<a id='line_149'>and honour.</a>
<a id='line_150'></a>
<a id='line_151'>3:17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</a>
<a id='line_152'></a>
<a id='line_153'>3:18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy</a>
<a id='line_154'>is every one that retaineth her.</a>
<a id='line_155'></a>
<a id='line_156'>3:19 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath</a>
<a id='line_157'>he established the heavens.</a>
<a id='line_158'></a>
<a id='line_159'>3:20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop</a>
<a id='line_160'>down the dew.</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>3:21 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom</a>
<a id='line_163'>and discretion: 3:22 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to</a>
<a id='line_164'>thy neck.</a>
<a id='line_165'></a>
<a id='line_166'>3:23 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not</a>
<a id='line_167'>stumble.</a>
<a id='line_168'></a>
<a id='line_169'>3:24 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_170'>lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.</a>
<a id='line_171'></a>
<a id='line_172'>3:25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the</a>
<a id='line_173'>wicked, when it cometh.</a>
<a id='line_174'></a>
<a id='line_175'>3:26 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot</a>
<a id='line_176'>from being taken.</a>
<a id='line_177'></a>
<a id='line_178'>3:27 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the</a>
<a id='line_179'>power of thine hand to do it.</a>
<a id='line_180'></a>
<a id='line_181'>3:28 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow I</a>
<a id='line_182'>will give; when thou hast it by thee.</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>3:29 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth</a>
<a id='line_185'>securely by thee.</a>
<a id='line_186'></a>
<a id='line_187'>3:30 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no</a>
<a id='line_188'>harm.</a>
<a id='line_189'></a>
<a id='line_190'>3:31 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.</a>
<a id='line_191'></a>
<a id='line_192'>3:32 For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is</a>
<a id='line_193'>with the righteous.</a>
<a id='line_194'></a>
<a id='line_195'>3:33 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he</a>
<a id='line_196'>blesseth the habitation of the just.</a>
<a id='line_197'></a>
<a id='line_198'>3:34 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the</a>
<a id='line_199'>lowly.</a>
<a id='line_200'></a>
<a id='line_201'>3:35 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion of</a>
<a id='line_202'>fools.</a>
<a id='line_203'></a>
<a id='line_204'>4:1 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know</a>
<a id='line_205'>understanding.</a>
<a id='line_206'></a>
<a id='line_207'>4:2 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.</a>
<a id='line_208'></a>
<a id='line_209'>4:3 For I was my father’s son, tender and only beloved in the sight of</a>
<a id='line_210'>my mother.</a>
<a id='line_211'></a>
<a id='line_212'>4:4 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my</a>
<a id='line_213'>words: keep my commandments, and live.</a>
<a id='line_214'></a>
<a id='line_215'>4:5 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from</a>
<a id='line_216'>the words of my mouth.</a>
<a id='line_217'></a>
<a id='line_218'>4:6 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and she</a>
<a id='line_219'>shall keep thee.</a>
<a id='line_220'></a>
<a id='line_221'>4:7 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all</a>
<a id='line_222'>thy getting get understanding.</a>
<a id='line_223'></a>
<a id='line_224'>4:8 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to</a>
<a id='line_225'>honour, when thou dost embrace her.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>4:9 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of</a>
<a id='line_228'>glory shall she deliver to thee.</a>
<a id='line_229'></a>
<a id='line_230'>4:10 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life</a>
<a id='line_231'>shall be many.</a>
<a id='line_232'></a>
<a id='line_233'>4:11 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right</a>
<a id='line_234'>paths.</a>
<a id='line_235'></a>
<a id='line_236'>4:12 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou</a>
<a id='line_237'>runnest, thou shalt not stumble.</a>
<a id='line_238'></a>
<a id='line_239'>4:13 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she</a>
<a id='line_240'>is thy life.</a>
<a id='line_241'></a>
<a id='line_242'>4:14 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of</a>
<a id='line_243'>evil men.</a>
<a id='line_244'></a>
<a id='line_245'>4:15 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.</a>
<a id='line_246'></a>
<a id='line_247'>4:16 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their</a>
<a id='line_248'>sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.</a>
<a id='line_249'></a>
<a id='line_250'>4:17 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of</a>
<a id='line_251'>violence.</a>
<a id='line_252'></a>
<a id='line_253'>4:18 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth</a>
<a id='line_254'>more and more unto the perfect day.</a>
<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'>4:19 The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they</a>
<a id='line_257'>stumble.</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>4:20 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.</a>
<a id='line_260'></a>
<a id='line_261'>4:21 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of</a>
<a id='line_262'>thine heart.</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>4:22 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all</a>
<a id='line_265'>their flesh.</a>
<a id='line_266'></a>
<a id='line_267'>4:23 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues</a>
<a id='line_268'>of life.</a>
<a id='line_269'></a>
<a id='line_270'>4:24 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far</a>
<a id='line_271'>from thee.</a>
<a id='line_272'></a>
<a id='line_273'>4:25 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight</a>
<a id='line_274'>before thee.</a>
<a id='line_275'></a>
<a id='line_276'>4:26 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.</a>
<a id='line_277'></a>
<a id='line_278'>4:27 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from</a>
<a id='line_279'>evil.</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>5:1 My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my</a>
<a id='line_282'>understanding: 5:2 That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy</a>
<a id='line_283'>lips may keep knowledge.</a>
<a id='line_284'></a>
<a id='line_285'>5:3 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her</a>
<a id='line_286'>mouth is smoother than oil: 5:4 But her end is bitter as wormwood,</a>
<a id='line_287'>sharp as a two-edged sword.</a>
<a id='line_288'></a>
<a id='line_289'>5:5 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.</a>
<a id='line_290'></a>
<a id='line_291'>5:6 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are</a>
<a id='line_292'>moveable, that thou canst not know them.</a>
<a id='line_293'></a>
<a id='line_294'>5:7 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the</a>
<a id='line_295'>words of my mouth.</a>
<a id='line_296'></a>
<a id='line_297'>5:8 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her</a>
<a id='line_298'>house: 5:9 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto</a>
<a id='line_299'>the cruel: 5:10 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy</a>
<a id='line_300'>labours be in the house of a stranger; 5:11 And thou mourn at the</a>
<a id='line_301'>last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, 5:12 And say, How have</a>
<a id='line_302'>I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; 5:13 And have not</a>
<a id='line_303'>obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that</a>
<a id='line_304'>instructed me!  5:14 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the</a>
<a id='line_305'>congregation and assembly.</a>
<a id='line_306'></a>
<a id='line_307'>5:15 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of</a>
<a id='line_308'>thine own well.</a>
<a id='line_309'></a>
<a id='line_310'>5:16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in</a>
<a id='line_311'>the streets.</a>
<a id='line_312'></a>
<a id='line_313'>5:17 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers’ with thee.</a>
<a id='line_314'></a>
<a id='line_315'>5:18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy</a>
<a id='line_316'>youth.</a>
<a id='line_317'></a>
<a id='line_318'>5:19 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts</a>
<a id='line_319'>satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.</a>
<a id='line_320'></a>
<a id='line_321'>5:20 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and</a>
<a id='line_322'>embrace the bosom of a stranger?  5:21 For the ways of man are before</a>
<a id='line_323'>the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.</a>
<a id='line_324'></a>
<a id='line_325'>5:22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be</a>
<a id='line_326'>holden with the cords of his sins.</a>
<a id='line_327'></a>
<a id='line_328'>5:23 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his</a>
<a id='line_329'>folly he shall go astray.</a>
<a id='line_330'></a>
<a id='line_331'>6:1 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken</a>
<a id='line_332'>thy hand with a stranger, 6:2 Thou art snared with the words of thy</a>
<a id='line_333'>mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.</a>

<a id='line_2357'>30:20 Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth</a>
<a id='line_2358'>her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.</a>
<a id='line_2359'></a>
<a id='line_2360'>30:21 For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it</a>
<a id='line_2361'>cannot bear: 30:22 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he</a>
<a id='line_2362'>is filled with meat; 30:23 For an odious woman when she is married;</a>
<a id='line_2363'>and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.</a>
<a id='line_2364'></a>
<a id='line_2365'>30:24 There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they</a>
<a id='line_2366'>are exceeding wise: 30:25 The ants are a people not strong, yet they</a>
<a id='line_2367'>prepare their meat in the summer; 30:26 The conies are but a feeble</a>
<a id='line_2368'>folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks; 30:27 The locusts have</a>
<a id='line_2369'>no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands; 30:28 The spider</a>
<a id='line_2370'>taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings’ palaces.</a>
<a id='line_2371'></a>
<a id='line_2372'>30:29 There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in</a>
<a id='line_2373'>going: 30:30 A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not</a>
<a id='line_2374'>away for any; 30:31 A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against</a>
<a id='line_2375'>whom there is no rising up.</a>
<a id='line_2376'></a>
<a id='line_2377'>30:32 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou</a>
<a id='line_2378'>hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.</a>
<a id='line_2379'></a>
<a id='line_2380'>30:33 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the</a>
<a id='line_2381'>wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath</a>
<a id='line_2382'>bringeth forth strife.</a>
<a id='line_2383'></a>
<a id='line_2384'>31:1 The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught</a>
<a id='line_2385'>him.</a>
<a id='line_2386'></a>
<a id='line_2387'>31:2 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of</a>
<a id='line_2388'>my vows?  31:3 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that</a>
<a id='line_2389'>which destroyeth kings.</a>
<a id='line_2390'></a>
<a id='line_2391'>31:4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine;</a>
<a id='line_2392'>nor for princes strong drink: 31:5 Lest they drink, and forget the</a>
<a id='line_2393'>law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.</a>
<a id='line_2394'></a>
<a id='line_2395'>31:6 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto</a>
<a id='line_2396'>those that be of heavy hearts.</a>
<a id='line_2397'></a>
<a id='line_2398'>31:7 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no</a>
<a id='line_2399'>more.</a>
<a id='line_2400'></a>
<a id='line_2401'>31:8 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are</a>
<a id='line_2402'>appointed to destruction.</a>
<a id='line_2403'></a>
<a id='line_2404'>31:9 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the</a>
<a id='line_2405'>poor and needy.</a>
<a id='line_2406'></a>
<a id='line_2407'>31:10 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above</a>
<a id='line_2408'>rubies.</a>
<a id='line_2409'></a>
<a id='line_2410'>31:11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he</a>
<a id='line_2411'>shall have no need of spoil.</a>
<a id='line_2412'></a>
<a id='line_2413'>31:12 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.</a>
<a id='line_2414'></a>
<a id='line_2415'>31:13 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her</a>
<a id='line_2416'>hands.</a>
<a id='line_2417'></a>
<a id='line_2418'>31:14 She is like the merchants’ ships; she bringeth her food from</a>
<a id='line_2419'>afar.</a>
<a id='line_2420'></a>
<a id='line_2421'>31:15 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her</a>
<a id='line_2422'>household, and a portion to her maidens.</a>
<a id='line_2423'></a>
<a id='line_2424'>31:16 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her</a>
<a id='line_2425'>hands she planteth a vineyard.</a>
<a id='line_2426'></a>
<a id='line_2427'>31:17 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.</a>
<a id='line_2428'></a>
<a id='line_2429'>31:18 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth</a>
<a id='line_2430'>not out by night.</a>
<a id='line_2431'></a>
<a id='line_2432'>31:19 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the</a>
<a id='line_2433'>distaff.</a>
<a id='line_2434'></a>
<a id='line_2435'>31:20 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth</a>
<a id='line_2436'>her hands to the needy.</a>
<a id='line_2437'></a>
<a id='line_2438'>31:21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her</a>
<a id='line_2439'>household are clothed with scarlet.</a>
<a id='line_2440'></a>
<a id='line_2441'>31:22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk</a>
<a id='line_2442'>and purple.</a>
<a id='line_2443'></a>
<a id='line_2444'>31:23 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the</a>
<a id='line_2445'>elders of the land.</a>
<a id='line_2446'></a>
<a id='line_2447'>31:24 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles</a>
<a id='line_2448'>unto the merchant.</a>
<a id='line_2449'></a>
<a id='line_2450'>31:25 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in</a>
<a id='line_2451'>time to come.</a>
<a id='line_2452'></a>
<a id='line_2453'>31:26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law</a>
<a id='line_2454'>of kindness.</a>
<a id='line_2455'></a>
<a id='line_2456'>31:27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not</a>
<a id='line_2457'>the bread of idleness.</a>
<a id='line_2458'></a>
<a id='line_2459'>31:28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,</a>
<a id='line_2460'>and he praiseth her.</a>
<a id='line_2461'></a>
<a id='line_2462'>31:29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them</a>
<a id='line_2463'>all.</a>
<a id='line_2464'></a>
<a id='line_2465'>31:30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that</a>
<a id='line_2466'>feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.</a>
<a id='line_2467'></a>
<a id='line_2468'>31:31 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praise</a>
<a id='line_2469'>her in the gates.</a>
