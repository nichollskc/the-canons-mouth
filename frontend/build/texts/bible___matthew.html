<a id='line_1'></a>
<a id='line_2'></a>
<a id='line_3'>1:1 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the</a>
<a id='line_4'>son of Abraham.</a>
<a id='line_5'></a>
<a id='line_6'>1:2 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas</a>
<a id='line_7'>and his brethren; 1:3 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and</a>
<a id='line_8'>Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram; 1:4 And Aram begat Aminadab;</a>
<a id='line_9'>and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon; 1:5 And Salmon</a>
<a id='line_10'>begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat</a>
<a id='line_11'>Jesse; 1:6 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat</a>
<a id='line_12'>Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias; 1:7 And Solomon begat</a>
<a id='line_13'>Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa; 1:8 And Asa begat</a>
<a id='line_14'>Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias; 1:9 And</a>
<a id='line_15'>Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;</a>
<a id='line_16'>1:10 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon</a>
<a id='line_17'>begat Josias; 1:11 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about</a>
<a id='line_18'>the time they were carried away to Babylon: 1:12 And after they were</a>
<a id='line_19'>brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat</a>
<a id='line_20'>Zorobabel; 1:13 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim;</a>
<a id='line_21'>and Eliakim begat Azor; 1:14 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat</a>
<a id='line_22'>Achim; and Achim begat Eliud; 1:15 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and</a>
<a id='line_23'>Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob; 1:16 And Jacob begat</a>
<a id='line_24'>Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called</a>
<a id='line_25'>Christ.</a>
<a id='line_26'></a>
<a id='line_27'>1:17 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen</a>
<a id='line_28'>generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are</a>
<a id='line_29'>fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto</a>
<a id='line_30'>Christ are fourteen generations.</a>
<a id='line_31'></a>
<a id='line_32'>1:18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his</a>
<a id='line_33'>mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was</a>
<a id='line_34'>found with child of the Holy Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_35'></a>
<a id='line_36'>1:19 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to</a>
<a id='line_37'>make her a publick example, was minded to put her away privily.</a>
<a id='line_38'></a>
<a id='line_39'>1:20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the</a>
<a id='line_40'>LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David,</a>
<a id='line_41'>fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived</a>
<a id='line_42'>in her is of the Holy Ghost.</a>
<a id='line_43'></a>
<a id='line_44'>1:21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name</a>
<a id='line_45'>JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.</a>
<a id='line_46'></a>
<a id='line_47'>1:22 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was</a>
<a id='line_48'>spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, 1:23 Behold, a virgin shall</a>
<a id='line_49'>be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his</a>
<a id='line_50'>name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.</a>
<a id='line_51'></a>
<a id='line_52'>1:24 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord</a>
<a id='line_53'>had bidden him, and took unto him his wife: 1:25 And knew her not till</a>
<a id='line_54'>she had brought forth her firstborn son: and he called his name JESUS.</a>
<a id='line_55'></a>
<a id='line_56'>2:1 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of</a>
<a id='line_57'>Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to</a>
<a id='line_58'>Jerusalem, 2:2 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for</a>
<a id='line_59'>we have seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.</a>
<a id='line_60'></a>
<a id='line_61'>2:3 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and</a>
<a id='line_62'>all Jerusalem with him.</a>
<a id='line_63'></a>
<a id='line_64'>2:4 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the</a>
<a id='line_65'>people together, he demanded of them where Christ should be born.</a>
<a id='line_66'></a>
<a id='line_67'>2:5 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is</a>
<a id='line_68'>written by the prophet, 2:6 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda,</a>
<a id='line_69'>art not the least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall</a>
<a id='line_70'>come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</a>
<a id='line_71'></a>
<a id='line_72'>2:7 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired of</a>
<a id='line_73'>them diligently what time the star appeared.</a>
<a id='line_74'></a>
<a id='line_75'>2:8 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently</a>
<a id='line_76'>for the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again,</a>
<a id='line_77'>that I may come and worship him also.</a>
<a id='line_78'></a>
<a id='line_79'>2:9 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star,</a>
<a id='line_80'>which they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood</a>
<a id='line_81'>over where the young child was.</a>
<a id='line_82'></a>
<a id='line_83'>2:10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</a>
<a id='line_84'></a>
<a id='line_85'>2:11 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child</a>
<a id='line_86'>with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they</a>
<a id='line_87'>had opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and</a>
<a id='line_88'>frankincense and myrrh.</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>2:12 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to</a>
<a id='line_91'>Herod, they departed into their own country another way.</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>2:13 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord</a>
<a id='line_94'>appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the young</a>
<a id='line_95'>child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there until I</a>
<a id='line_96'>bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him.</a>
<a id='line_97'></a>
<a id='line_98'>2:14 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by night,</a>
<a id='line_99'>and departed into Egypt: 2:15 And was there until the death of Herod:</a>
<a id='line_100'>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the</a>
<a id='line_101'>prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.</a>
<a id='line_102'></a>
<a id='line_103'>2:16 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men, was</a>
<a id='line_104'>exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children that were</a>
<a id='line_105'>in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from two years old and</a>
<a id='line_106'>under, according to the time which he had diligently enquired of the</a>
<a id='line_107'>wise men.</a>
<a id='line_108'></a>
<a id='line_109'>2:17 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,</a>
<a id='line_110'>saying, 2:18 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and</a>
<a id='line_111'>weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and</a>
<a id='line_112'>would not be comforted, because they are not.</a>
<a id='line_113'></a>
<a id='line_114'>2:19 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeareth</a>
<a id='line_115'>in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, 2:20 Saying, Arise, and take the young</a>
<a id='line_116'>child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are</a>
<a id='line_117'>dead which sought the young child’s life.</a>
<a id='line_118'></a>
<a id='line_119'>2:21 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and came</a>
<a id='line_120'>into the land of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>2:22 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the room</a>
<a id='line_123'>of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding,</a>
<a id='line_124'>being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of</a>
<a id='line_125'>Galilee: 2:23 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it</a>
<a id='line_126'>might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be</a>
<a id='line_127'>called a Nazarene.</a>
<a id='line_128'></a>
<a id='line_129'>3:1 In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness</a>
<a id='line_130'>of Judaea, 3:2 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at</a>
<a id='line_131'>hand.</a>
<a id='line_132'></a>
<a id='line_133'>3:3 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying,</a>
<a id='line_134'>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the</a>
<a id='line_135'>Lord, make his paths straight.</a>
<a id='line_136'></a>
<a id='line_137'>3:4 And the same John had his raiment of camel’s hair, and a leathern</a>
<a id='line_138'>girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and wild honey.</a>
<a id='line_139'></a>
<a id='line_140'>3:5 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region</a>
<a id='line_141'>round about Jordan, 3:6 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing</a>
<a id='line_142'>their sins.</a>
<a id='line_143'></a>
<a id='line_144'>3:7 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his</a>
<a id='line_145'>baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned</a>
<a id='line_146'>you to flee from the wrath to come?  3:8 Bring forth therefore fruits</a>
<a id='line_147'>meet for repentance: 3:9 And think not to say within yourselves, We</a>
<a id='line_148'>have Abraham to our father: for I say unto you, that God is able of</a>
<a id='line_149'>these stones to raise up children unto Abraham.</a>
<a id='line_150'></a>
<a id='line_151'>3:10 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:</a>
<a id='line_152'>therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,</a>
<a id='line_153'>and cast into the fire.</a>
<a id='line_154'></a>
<a id='line_155'>3:11 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance. but he that</a>
<a id='line_156'>cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to</a>
<a id='line_157'>bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire: 3:12</a>
<a id='line_158'>Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his floor, and</a>
<a id='line_159'>gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn up the chaff with</a>
<a id='line_160'>unquenchable fire.</a>
<a id='line_161'></a>
<a id='line_162'>3:13 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be</a>
<a id='line_163'>baptized of him.</a>
<a id='line_164'></a>
<a id='line_165'>3:14 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee,</a>
<a id='line_166'>and comest thou to me?  3:15 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer</a>
<a id='line_167'>it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness.</a>
<a id='line_168'>Then he suffered him.</a>
<a id='line_169'></a>
<a id='line_170'>3:16 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the</a>
<a id='line_171'>water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the</a>
<a id='line_172'>Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him: 3:17 And</a>
<a id='line_173'>lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am</a>
<a id='line_174'>well pleased.</a>
<a id='line_175'></a>
<a id='line_176'>4:1 Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be</a>
<a id='line_177'>tempted of the devil.</a>
<a id='line_178'></a>
<a id='line_179'>4:2 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was</a>
<a id='line_180'>afterward an hungred.</a>
<a id='line_181'></a>
<a id='line_182'>4:3 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of</a>
<a id='line_183'>God, command that these stones be made bread.</a>
<a id='line_184'></a>
<a id='line_185'>4:4 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by</a>
<a id='line_186'>bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of</a>
<a id='line_187'>God.</a>
<a id='line_188'></a>
<a id='line_189'>4:5 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth him</a>
<a id='line_190'>on a pinnacle of the temple, 4:6 And saith unto him, If thou be the</a>
<a id='line_191'>Son of God, cast thyself down: for it is written, He shall give his</a>
<a id='line_192'>angels charge concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee</a>
<a id='line_193'>up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.</a>
<a id='line_194'></a>
<a id='line_195'>4:7 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the</a>
<a id='line_196'>Lord thy God.</a>
<a id='line_197'></a>
<a id='line_198'>4:8 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain,</a>
<a id='line_199'>and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;</a>
<a id='line_200'>4:9 And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou</a>
<a id='line_201'>wilt fall down and worship me.</a>
<a id='line_202'></a>
<a id='line_203'>4:10 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is</a>
<a id='line_204'>written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou</a>
<a id='line_205'>serve.</a>
<a id='line_206'></a>
<a id='line_207'>4:11 Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and</a>
<a id='line_208'>ministered unto him.</a>
<a id='line_209'></a>
<a id='line_210'>4:12 Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he</a>
<a id='line_211'>departed into Galilee; 4:13 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in</a>
<a id='line_212'>Capernaum, which is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and</a>
<a id='line_213'>Nephthalim: 4:14 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias</a>
<a id='line_214'>the prophet, saying, 4:15 The land of Zabulon, and the land of</a>
<a id='line_215'>Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the</a>
<a id='line_216'>Gentiles; 4:16 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and</a>
<a id='line_217'>to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung</a>
<a id='line_218'>up.</a>
<a id='line_219'></a>
<a id='line_220'>4:17 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the</a>
<a id='line_221'>kingdom of heaven is at hand.</a>
<a id='line_222'></a>
<a id='line_223'>4:18 And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren, Simon</a>
<a id='line_224'>called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for</a>
<a id='line_225'>they were fishers.</a>
<a id='line_226'></a>
<a id='line_227'>4:19 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of</a>
<a id='line_228'>men.</a>
<a id='line_229'></a>
<a id='line_230'>4:20 And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.</a>
<a id='line_231'></a>
<a id='line_232'>4:21 And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the</a>
<a id='line_233'>son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee their</a>
<a id='line_234'>father, mending their nets; and he called them.</a>
<a id='line_235'></a>
<a id='line_236'>4:22 And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed</a>
<a id='line_237'>him.</a>
<a id='line_238'></a>
<a id='line_239'>4:23 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues,</a>
<a id='line_240'>and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all manner of</a>
<a id='line_241'>sickness and all manner of disease among the people.</a>
<a id='line_242'></a>
<a id='line_243'>4:24 And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto him</a>
<a id='line_244'>all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and</a>
<a id='line_245'>those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatick,</a>
<a id='line_246'>and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.</a>
<a id='line_247'></a>
<a id='line_248'>4:25 And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee,</a>
<a id='line_249'>and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from</a>
<a id='line_250'>beyond Jordan.</a>
<a id='line_251'></a>
<a id='line_252'>5:1 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he</a>
<a id='line_253'>was set, his disciples came unto him: 5:2 And he opened his mouth, and</a>
<a id='line_254'>taught them, saying, 5:3 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is</a>
<a id='line_255'>the kingdom of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_256'></a>
<a id='line_257'>5:4 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.</a>
<a id='line_258'></a>
<a id='line_259'>5:5 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.</a>
<a id='line_260'></a>
<a id='line_261'>5:6 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness:</a>
<a id='line_262'>for they shall be filled.</a>
<a id='line_263'></a>
<a id='line_264'>5:7 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.</a>
<a id='line_265'></a>
<a id='line_266'>5:8 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.</a>
<a id='line_267'></a>
<a id='line_268'>5:9 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children</a>
<a id='line_269'>of God.</a>
<a id='line_270'></a>
<a id='line_271'>5:10 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness’ sake:</a>
<a id='line_272'>for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_273'></a>
<a id='line_274'>5:11 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and</a>
<a id='line_275'>shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.</a>
<a id='line_276'></a>
<a id='line_277'>5:12 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in</a>
<a id='line_278'>heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you.</a>
<a id='line_279'></a>
<a id='line_280'>5:13 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his</a>
<a id='line_281'>savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for</a>
<a id='line_282'>nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.</a>
<a id='line_283'></a>
<a id='line_284'>5:14 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill</a>
<a id='line_285'>cannot be hid.</a>
<a id='line_286'></a>
<a id='line_287'>5:15 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but on</a>
<a id='line_288'>a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the house.</a>
<a id='line_289'></a>
<a id='line_290'>5:16 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good</a>
<a id='line_291'>works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_292'></a>
<a id='line_293'>5:17 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I</a>
<a id='line_294'>am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.</a>
<a id='line_295'></a>
<a id='line_296'>5:18 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot or</a>
<a id='line_297'>one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</a>
<a id='line_298'></a>
<a id='line_299'>5:19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments,</a>
<a id='line_300'>and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_301'>heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be</a>
<a id='line_302'>called great in the kingdom of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_303'></a>
<a id='line_304'>5:20 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall exceed</a>
<a id='line_305'>the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall in no case</a>
<a id='line_306'>enter into the kingdom of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_307'></a>
<a id='line_308'>5:21 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_309'>not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:</a>
<a id='line_310'>5:22 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother</a>
<a id='line_311'>without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whosoever</a>
<a id='line_312'>shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but</a>
<a id='line_313'>whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.</a>
<a id='line_314'></a>
<a id='line_315'>5:23 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there</a>
<a id='line_316'>rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee; 5:24 Leave there</a>
<a id='line_317'>thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled to thy</a>
<a id='line_318'>brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</a>
<a id='line_319'></a>
<a id='line_320'>5:25 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way</a>
<a id='line_321'>with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the judge,</a>
<a id='line_322'>and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into</a>
<a id='line_323'>prison.</a>
<a id='line_324'></a>
<a id='line_325'>5:26 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out thence,</a>
<a id='line_326'>till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.</a>
<a id='line_327'></a>
<a id='line_328'>5:27 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt</a>
<a id='line_329'>not commit adultery: 5:28 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh</a>
<a id='line_330'>on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already</a>
<a id='line_331'>in his heart.</a>
<a id='line_332'></a>
<a id='line_333'>5:29 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from</a>
<a id='line_334'>thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should</a>
<a id='line_335'>perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</a>
<a id='line_336'></a>
<a id='line_337'>5:30 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it from</a>
<a id='line_338'>thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should</a>
<a id='line_339'>perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell.</a>
<a id='line_340'></a>
<a id='line_341'>5:31 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him</a>
<a id='line_342'>give her a writing of divorcement: 5:32 But I say unto you, That</a>
<a id='line_343'>whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of</a>
<a id='line_344'>fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry</a>
<a id='line_345'>her that is divorced committeth adultery.</a>
<a id='line_346'></a>
<a id='line_347'>5:33 Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time,</a>
<a id='line_348'>Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine</a>
<a id='line_349'>oaths: 5:34 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven;</a>
<a id='line_350'>for it is God’s throne: 5:35 Nor by the earth; for it is his</a>
<a id='line_351'>footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.</a>
<a id='line_352'></a>
<a id='line_353'>5:36 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make</a>
<a id='line_354'>one hair white or black.</a>
<a id='line_355'></a>
<a id='line_356'>5:37 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for whatsoever</a>
<a id='line_357'>is more than these cometh of evil.</a>
<a id='line_358'></a>
<a id='line_359'>5:38 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a</a>
<a id='line_360'>tooth for a tooth: 5:39 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil:</a>
<a id='line_361'>but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the</a>
<a id='line_362'>other also.</a>
<a id='line_363'></a>
<a id='line_364'>5:40 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat,</a>
<a id='line_365'>let him have thy cloak also.</a>
<a id='line_366'></a>
<a id='line_367'>5:41 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him twain.</a>
<a id='line_368'></a>
<a id='line_369'>5:42 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of</a>
<a id='line_370'>thee turn not thou away.</a>
<a id='line_371'></a>
<a id='line_372'>5:43 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy</a>
<a id='line_373'>neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</a>
<a id='line_374'></a>
<a id='line_375'>5:44 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you,</a>
<a id='line_376'>do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully</a>
<a id='line_377'>use you, and persecute you; 5:45 That ye may be the children of your</a>
<a id='line_378'>Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil</a>
<a id='line_379'>and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</a>
<a id='line_380'></a>
<a id='line_381'>5:46 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not</a>
<a id='line_382'>even the publicans the same?  5:47 And if ye salute your brethren</a>
<a id='line_383'>only, what do ye more than others? do not even the publicans so?  5:48</a>
<a id='line_384'>Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is</a>
<a id='line_385'>perfect.</a>
<a id='line_386'></a>
<a id='line_387'>6:1 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of them:</a>
<a id='line_388'>otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_389'></a>
<a id='line_390'>6:2 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet</a>
<a id='line_391'>before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the</a>
<a id='line_392'>streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto you, They</a>
<a id='line_393'>have their reward.</a>
<a id='line_394'></a>
<a id='line_395'>6:3 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy</a>
<a id='line_396'>right hand doeth: 6:4 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father</a>
<a id='line_397'>which seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly.</a>
<a id='line_398'></a>
<a id='line_399'>6:5 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are:</a>
<a id='line_400'>for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of</a>
<a id='line_401'>the streets, that they may be seen of men. Verily I say unto you, They</a>
<a id='line_402'>have their reward.</a>
<a id='line_403'></a>
<a id='line_404'>6:6 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou</a>
<a id='line_405'>hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy</a>
<a id='line_406'>Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.</a>
<a id='line_407'></a>
<a id='line_408'>6:7 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do: for</a>
<a id='line_409'>they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking.</a>
<a id='line_410'></a>
<a id='line_411'>6:8 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth what</a>
<a id='line_412'>things ye have need of, before ye ask him.</a>
<a id='line_413'></a>
<a id='line_414'>6:9 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in</a>
<a id='line_415'>heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</a>
<a id='line_416'></a>
<a id='line_417'>6:10 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_418'></a>
<a id='line_419'>6:11 Give us this day our daily bread.</a>
<a id='line_420'></a>
<a id='line_421'>6:12 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</a>
<a id='line_422'></a>
<a id='line_423'>6:13 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For</a>
<a id='line_424'>thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_425'></a>
<a id='line_426'>6:14 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will</a>
<a id='line_427'>also forgive you: 6:15 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses,</a>
<a id='line_428'>neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</a>
<a id='line_429'></a>
<a id='line_430'>6:16 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad</a>
<a id='line_431'>countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear unto</a>
<a id='line_432'>men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.</a>
<a id='line_433'></a>
<a id='line_434'>6:17 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy</a>
<a id='line_435'>face; 6:18 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father</a>
<a id='line_436'>which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret, shall</a>
<a id='line_437'>reward thee openly.</a>
<a id='line_438'></a>
<a id='line_439'>6:19 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and</a>
<a id='line_440'>rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: 6:20 But</a>
<a id='line_441'>lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust</a>
<a id='line_442'>doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal: 6:21</a>
<a id='line_443'>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</a>
<a id='line_444'></a>
<a id='line_445'>6:22 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be</a>
<a id='line_446'>single, thy whole body shall be full of light.</a>
<a id='line_447'></a>
<a id='line_448'>6:23 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of</a>
<a id='line_449'>darkness.</a>
<a id='line_450'></a>
<a id='line_451'>If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, how great is that</a>
<a id='line_452'>darkness!  6:24 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate</a>
<a id='line_453'>the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and</a>
<a id='line_454'>despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.</a>
<a id='line_455'></a>
<a id='line_456'>6:25 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye</a>
<a id='line_457'>shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye</a>
<a id='line_458'>shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than</a>
<a id='line_459'>raiment?  6:26 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither</a>
<a id='line_460'>do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth</a>
<a id='line_461'>them. Are ye not much better than they?  6:27 Which of you by taking</a>
<a id='line_462'>thought can add one cubit unto his stature?  6:28 And why take ye</a>
<a id='line_463'>thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow;</a>
<a id='line_464'>they toil not, neither do they spin: 6:29 And yet I say unto you, That</a>
<a id='line_465'>even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</a>
<a id='line_466'></a>
<a id='line_467'>6:30 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day</a>
<a id='line_468'>is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe</a>
<a id='line_469'>you, O ye of little faith?  6:31 Therefore take no thought, saying,</a>
<a id='line_470'>What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we</a>
<a id='line_471'>be clothed?  6:32 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:)</a>
<a id='line_472'>for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these</a>
<a id='line_473'>things.</a>
<a id='line_474'></a>
<a id='line_475'>6:33 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and</a>
<a id='line_476'>all these things shall be added unto you.</a>
<a id='line_477'></a>
<a id='line_478'>6:34 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall</a>
<a id='line_479'>take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the</a>
<a id='line_480'>evil thereof.</a>
<a id='line_481'></a>
<a id='line_482'>7:1 Judge not, that ye be not judged.</a>
<a id='line_483'></a>
<a id='line_484'>7:2 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what</a>
<a id='line_485'>measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.</a>
<a id='line_486'></a>
<a id='line_487'>7:3 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but</a>
<a id='line_488'>considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?  7:4 Or how wilt</a>
<a id='line_489'>thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of thine eye;</a>
<a id='line_490'>and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?  7:5 Thou hypocrite, first</a>
<a id='line_491'>cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see</a>
<a id='line_492'>clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother’s eye.</a>
<a id='line_493'></a>
<a id='line_494'>7:6 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your</a>
<a id='line_495'>pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn</a>
<a id='line_496'>again and rend you.</a>
<a id='line_497'></a>
<a id='line_498'>7:7 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock,</a>
<a id='line_499'>and it shall be opened unto you: 7:8 For every one that asketh</a>
<a id='line_500'>receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it</a>
<a id='line_501'>shall be opened.</a>
<a id='line_502'></a>
<a id='line_503'>7:9 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he</a>
<a id='line_504'>give him a stone?  7:10 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a</a>
<a id='line_505'>serpent?  7:11 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts</a>
<a id='line_506'>unto your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven</a>
<a id='line_507'>give good things to them that ask him?  7:12 Therefore all things</a>
<a id='line_508'>whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them:</a>
<a id='line_509'>for this is the law and the prophets.</a>
<a id='line_510'></a>
<a id='line_511'>7:13 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad</a>
<a id='line_512'>is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in</a>
<a id='line_513'>thereat: 7:14 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which</a>
<a id='line_514'>leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</a>
<a id='line_515'></a>
<a id='line_516'>7:15 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep’s clothing,</a>
<a id='line_517'>but inwardly they are ravening wolves.</a>
<a id='line_518'></a>
<a id='line_519'>7:16 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of</a>
<a id='line_520'>thorns, or figs of thistles?  7:17 Even so every good tree bringeth</a>
<a id='line_521'>forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.</a>
<a id='line_522'></a>
<a id='line_523'>7:18 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt</a>
<a id='line_524'>tree bring forth good fruit.</a>
<a id='line_525'></a>
<a id='line_526'>7:19 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and</a>
<a id='line_527'>cast into the fire.</a>
<a id='line_528'></a>
<a id='line_529'>7:20 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.</a>
<a id='line_530'></a>
<a id='line_531'>7:21 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into</a>
<a id='line_532'>the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which</a>
<a id='line_533'>is in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_534'></a>
<a id='line_535'>7:22 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not</a>
<a id='line_536'>prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in</a>
<a id='line_537'>thy name done many wonderful works?  7:23 And then will I profess unto</a>
<a id='line_538'>them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_539'></a>
<a id='line_540'>7:24 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth</a>
<a id='line_541'>them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a</a>
<a id='line_542'>rock: 7:25 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds</a>
<a id='line_543'>blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded</a>
<a id='line_544'>upon a rock.</a>
<a id='line_545'></a>
<a id='line_546'>7:26 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them</a>
<a id='line_547'>not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon</a>
<a id='line_548'>the sand: 7:27 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the</a>
<a id='line_549'>winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the</a>
<a id='line_550'>fall of it.</a>
<a id='line_551'></a>
<a id='line_552'>7:28 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the</a>
<a id='line_553'>people were astonished at his doctrine: 7:29 For he taught them as one</a>
<a id='line_554'>having authority, and not as the scribes.</a>
<a id='line_555'></a>
<a id='line_556'>8:1 When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes followed</a>
<a id='line_557'>him.</a>
<a id='line_558'></a>
<a id='line_559'>8:2 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying, Lord,</a>
<a id='line_560'>if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.</a>
<a id='line_561'></a>
<a id='line_562'>8:3 And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be</a>
<a id='line_563'>thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</a>
<a id='line_564'></a>
<a id='line_565'>8:4 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy way,</a>
<a id='line_566'>shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded,</a>
<a id='line_567'>for a testimony unto them.</a>
<a id='line_568'></a>
<a id='line_569'>8:5 And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him a</a>
<a id='line_570'>centurion, beseeching him, 8:6 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at</a>
<a id='line_571'>home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented.</a>
<a id='line_572'></a>
<a id='line_573'>8:7 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.</a>
<a id='line_574'></a>
<a id='line_575'>8:8 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that thou</a>
<a id='line_576'>shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only, and my servant</a>
<a id='line_577'>shall be healed.</a>
<a id='line_578'></a>
<a id='line_579'>8:9 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and I</a>
<a id='line_580'>say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he</a>
<a id='line_581'>cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.</a>
<a id='line_582'></a>
<a id='line_583'>8:10 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that</a>
<a id='line_584'>followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great faith, no,</a>
<a id='line_585'>not in Israel.</a>
<a id='line_586'></a>
<a id='line_587'>8:11 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and west,</a>
<a id='line_588'>and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom</a>
<a id='line_589'>of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_590'></a>
<a id='line_591'>8:12 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer</a>
<a id='line_592'>darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</a>
<a id='line_593'></a>
<a id='line_594'>8:13 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou hast</a>
<a id='line_595'>believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was healed in the</a>
<a id='line_596'>selfsame hour.</a>
<a id='line_597'></a>
<a id='line_598'>8:14 And when Jesus was come into Peter’s house, he saw his wife’s</a>
<a id='line_599'>mother laid, and sick of a fever.</a>
<a id='line_600'></a>
<a id='line_601'>8:15 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she arose,</a>
<a id='line_602'>and ministered unto them.</a>
<a id='line_603'></a>
<a id='line_604'>8:16 When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were</a>
<a id='line_605'>possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his word, and</a>
<a id='line_606'>healed all that were sick: 8:17 That it might be fulfilled which was</a>
<a id='line_607'>spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities,</a>
<a id='line_608'>and bare our sicknesses.</a>
<a id='line_609'></a>
<a id='line_610'>8:18 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave</a>
<a id='line_611'>commandment to depart unto the other side.</a>
<a id='line_612'></a>
<a id='line_613'>8:19 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will</a>
<a id='line_614'>follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</a>
<a id='line_615'></a>
<a id='line_616'>8:20 And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of</a>
<a id='line_617'>the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</a>
<a id='line_618'></a>
<a id='line_619'>8:21 And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me first</a>
<a id='line_620'>to go and bury my father.</a>
<a id='line_621'></a>
<a id='line_622'>8:22 But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury their</a>
<a id='line_623'>dead.</a>
<a id='line_624'></a>
<a id='line_625'>8:23 And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him.</a>
<a id='line_626'></a>
<a id='line_627'>8:24 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch</a>
<a id='line_628'>that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.</a>
<a id='line_629'></a>
<a id='line_630'>8:25 And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save</a>
<a id='line_631'>us: we perish.</a>
<a id='line_632'></a>
<a id='line_633'>8:26 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith?</a>
<a id='line_634'>Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a</a>
<a id='line_635'>great calm.</a>
<a id='line_636'></a>
<a id='line_637'>8:27 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that</a>
<a id='line_638'>even the winds and the sea obey him!  8:28 And when he was come to the</a>
<a id='line_639'>other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two</a>
<a id='line_640'>possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so</a>
<a id='line_641'>that no man might pass by that way.</a>
<a id='line_642'></a>
<a id='line_643'>8:29 And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with</a>
<a id='line_644'>thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment us</a>
<a id='line_645'>before the time?  8:30 And there was a good way off from them an herd</a>
<a id='line_646'>of many swine feeding.</a>
<a id='line_647'></a>
<a id='line_648'>8:31 So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer</a>
<a id='line_649'>us to go away into the herd of swine.</a>
<a id='line_650'></a>
<a id='line_651'>8:32 And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they went</a>
<a id='line_652'>into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of swine ran</a>
<a id='line_653'>violently down a steep place into the sea, and perished in the waters.</a>
<a id='line_654'></a>
<a id='line_655'>8:33 And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the city,</a>
<a id='line_656'>and told every thing, and what was befallen to the possessed of the</a>
<a id='line_657'>devils.</a>
<a id='line_658'></a>
<a id='line_659'>8:34 And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when they</a>
<a id='line_660'>saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of their coasts.</a>
<a id='line_661'></a>
<a id='line_662'>9:1 And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own</a>
<a id='line_663'>city.</a>
<a id='line_664'></a>
<a id='line_665'>9:2 And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on</a>
<a id='line_666'>a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the sick of the palsy;</a>
<a id='line_667'>Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven thee.</a>
<a id='line_668'></a>
<a id='line_669'>9:3 And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves, This</a>
<a id='line_670'>man blasphemeth.</a>
<a id='line_671'></a>
<a id='line_672'>9:4 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil in</a>
<a id='line_673'>your hearts?  9:5 For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven</a>
<a id='line_674'>thee; or to say, Arise, and walk?  9:6 But that ye may know that the</a>
<a id='line_675'>Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, (then saith he to the</a>
<a id='line_676'>sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.</a>
<a id='line_677'></a>
<a id='line_678'>9:7 And he arose, and departed to his house.</a>
<a id='line_679'></a>
<a id='line_680'>9:8 But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified God,</a>
<a id='line_681'>which had given such power unto men.</a>
<a id='line_682'></a>
<a id='line_683'>9:9 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named</a>
<a id='line_684'>Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto him,</a>
<a id='line_685'>Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.</a>
<a id='line_686'></a>
<a id='line_687'>9:10 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house, behold,</a>
<a id='line_688'>many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him and his</a>
<a id='line_689'>disciples.</a>
<a id='line_690'></a>
<a id='line_691'>9:11 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples, Why</a>
<a id='line_692'>eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?  9:12 But when Jesus</a>
<a id='line_693'>heard that, he said unto them, They that be whole need not a</a>
<a id='line_694'>physician, but they that are sick.</a>
<a id='line_695'></a>
<a id='line_696'>9:13 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not</a>
<a id='line_697'>sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to</a>
<a id='line_698'>repentance.</a>
<a id='line_699'></a>
<a id='line_700'>9:14 Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the</a>
<a id='line_701'>Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?  9:15 And Jesus said</a>
<a id='line_702'>unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the</a>
<a id='line_703'>bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom</a>
<a id='line_704'>shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast.</a>
<a id='line_705'></a>
<a id='line_706'>9:16 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that</a>
<a id='line_707'>which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is</a>
<a id='line_708'>made worse.</a>
<a id='line_709'></a>
<a id='line_710'>9:17 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles</a>
<a id='line_711'>break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put</a>
<a id='line_712'>new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.</a>
<a id='line_713'></a>
<a id='line_714'>9:18 While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a</a>
<a id='line_715'>certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now</a>
<a id='line_716'>dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live.</a>
<a id='line_717'></a>
<a id='line_718'>9:19 And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.</a>
<a id='line_719'></a>
<a id='line_720'>9:20 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood</a>
<a id='line_721'>twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:</a>
<a id='line_722'>9:21 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I</a>
<a id='line_723'>shall be whole.</a>
<a id='line_724'></a>
<a id='line_725'>9:22 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said,</a>
<a id='line_726'>Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole. And the</a>
<a id='line_727'>woman was made whole from that hour.</a>
<a id='line_728'></a>
<a id='line_729'>9:23 And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house, and saw the minstrels</a>
<a id='line_730'>and the people making a noise, 9:24 He said unto them, Give place: for</a>
<a id='line_731'>the maid is not dead, but sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.</a>
<a id='line_732'></a>
<a id='line_733'>9:25 But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her by</a>
<a id='line_734'>the hand, and the maid arose.</a>
<a id='line_735'></a>
<a id='line_736'>9:26 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.</a>
<a id='line_737'></a>
<a id='line_738'>9:27 And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him,</a>
<a id='line_739'>crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us.</a>
<a id='line_740'></a>
<a id='line_741'>9:28 And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to him:</a>
<a id='line_742'>and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to do this? They</a>
<a id='line_743'>said unto him, Yea, Lord.</a>
<a id='line_744'></a>
<a id='line_745'>9:29 Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it</a>
<a id='line_746'>unto you.</a>
<a id='line_747'></a>
<a id='line_748'>9:30 And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them,</a>
<a id='line_749'>saying, See that no man know it.</a>
<a id='line_750'></a>
<a id='line_751'>9:31 But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all</a>
<a id='line_752'>that country.</a>
<a id='line_753'></a>
<a id='line_754'>9:32 As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man</a>
<a id='line_755'>possessed with a devil.</a>
<a id='line_756'></a>
<a id='line_757'>9:33 And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the</a>
<a id='line_758'>multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.</a>
<a id='line_759'></a>
<a id='line_760'>9:34 But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the prince</a>
<a id='line_761'>of the devils.</a>
<a id='line_762'></a>
<a id='line_763'>9:35 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in</a>
<a id='line_764'>their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing</a>
<a id='line_765'>every sickness and every disease among the people.</a>
<a id='line_766'></a>
<a id='line_767'>9:36 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on</a>
<a id='line_768'>them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having</a>
<a id='line_769'>no shepherd.</a>
<a id='line_770'></a>
<a id='line_771'>9:37 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous,</a>
<a id='line_772'>but the labourers are few; 9:38 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the</a>
<a id='line_773'>harvest, that he will send forth labourers into his harvest.</a>
<a id='line_774'></a>
<a id='line_775'>10:1 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave</a>
<a id='line_776'>them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all</a>
<a id='line_777'>manner of sickness and all manner of disease.</a>
<a id='line_778'></a>
<a id='line_779'>10:2 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first, Simon,</a>
<a id='line_780'>who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee,</a>
<a id='line_781'>and John his brother; 10:3 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and</a>
<a id='line_782'>Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose</a>
<a id='line_783'>surname was Thaddaeus; 10:4 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot,</a>
<a id='line_784'>who also betrayed him.</a>
<a id='line_785'></a>
<a id='line_786'>10:5 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go not</a>
<a id='line_787'>into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans</a>
<a id='line_788'>enter ye not: 10:6 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of</a>
<a id='line_789'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_790'></a>
<a id='line_791'>10:7 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.</a>
<a id='line_792'></a>
<a id='line_793'>10:8 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out</a>
<a id='line_794'>devils: freely ye have received, freely give.</a>
<a id='line_795'></a>
<a id='line_796'>10:9 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses, 10:10</a>
<a id='line_797'>Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet</a>
<a id='line_798'>staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.</a>
<a id='line_799'></a>
<a id='line_800'>10:11 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who in</a>
<a id='line_801'>it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.</a>
<a id='line_802'></a>
<a id='line_803'>10:12 And when ye come into an house, salute it.</a>
<a id='line_804'></a>
<a id='line_805'>10:13 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but if</a>
<a id='line_806'>it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.</a>
<a id='line_807'></a>
<a id='line_808'>10:14 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when</a>
<a id='line_809'>ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of your feet.</a>
<a id='line_810'></a>
<a id='line_811'>10:15 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land</a>
<a id='line_812'>of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.</a>
<a id='line_813'></a>
<a id='line_814'>10:16 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye</a>
<a id='line_815'>therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.</a>
<a id='line_816'></a>
<a id='line_817'>10:17 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils,</a>
<a id='line_818'>and they will scourge you in their synagogues; 10:18 And ye shall be</a>
<a id='line_819'>brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony</a>
<a id='line_820'>against them and the Gentiles.</a>
<a id='line_821'></a>
<a id='line_822'>10:19 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye</a>
<a id='line_823'>shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what ye shall</a>
<a id='line_824'>speak.</a>
<a id='line_825'></a>
<a id='line_826'>10:20 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which</a>
<a id='line_827'>speaketh in you.</a>
<a id='line_828'></a>
<a id='line_829'>10:21 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the</a>
<a id='line_830'>father the child: and the children shall rise up against their</a>
<a id='line_831'>parents, and cause them to be put to death.</a>
<a id='line_832'></a>
<a id='line_833'>10:22 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name’s sake: but he that</a>
<a id='line_834'>endureth to the end shall be saved.</a>
<a id='line_835'></a>
<a id='line_836'>10:23 But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into another:</a>
<a id='line_837'>for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone over the cities of</a>
<a id='line_838'>Israel, till the Son of man be come.</a>
<a id='line_839'></a>
<a id='line_840'>10:24 The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above his</a>
<a id='line_841'>lord.</a>
<a id='line_842'></a>
<a id='line_843'>10:25 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the</a>
<a id='line_844'>servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house</a>
<a id='line_845'>Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his household?  10:26</a>
<a id='line_846'>Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not</a>
<a id='line_847'>be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.</a>
<a id='line_848'></a>
<a id='line_849'>10:27 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what ye</a>
<a id='line_850'>hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.</a>
<a id='line_851'></a>
<a id='line_852'>10:28 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill</a>
<a id='line_853'>the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and</a>
<a id='line_854'>body in hell.</a>
<a id='line_855'></a>
<a id='line_856'>10:29 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them shall</a>
<a id='line_857'>not fall on the ground without your Father.</a>
<a id='line_858'></a>
<a id='line_859'>10:30 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</a>
<a id='line_860'></a>
<a id='line_861'>10:31 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many sparrows.</a>
<a id='line_862'></a>
<a id='line_863'>10:32 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I</a>
<a id='line_864'>confess also before my Father which is in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_865'></a>
<a id='line_866'>10:33 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny</a>
<a id='line_867'>before my Father which is in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_868'></a>
<a id='line_869'>10:34 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to</a>
<a id='line_870'>send peace, but a sword.</a>
<a id='line_871'></a>
<a id='line_872'>10:35 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and</a>
<a id='line_873'>the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law against her</a>
<a id='line_874'>mother in law.</a>
<a id='line_875'></a>
<a id='line_876'>10:36 And a man’s foes shall be they of his own household.</a>
<a id='line_877'></a>
<a id='line_878'>10:37 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of</a>
<a id='line_879'>me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of</a>
<a id='line_880'>me.</a>
<a id='line_881'></a>
<a id='line_882'>10:38 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is not</a>
<a id='line_883'>worthy of me.</a>
<a id='line_884'></a>
<a id='line_885'>10:39 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his</a>
<a id='line_886'>life for my sake shall find it.</a>
<a id='line_887'></a>
<a id='line_888'>10:40 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me</a>
<a id='line_889'>receiveth him that sent me.</a>
<a id='line_890'></a>
<a id='line_891'>10:41 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall</a>
<a id='line_892'>receive a prophet’s reward; and he that receiveth a righteous man in</a>
<a id='line_893'>the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man’s reward.</a>
<a id='line_894'></a>
<a id='line_895'>10:42 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones</a>
<a id='line_896'>a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto</a>
<a id='line_897'>you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.</a>
<a id='line_898'></a>
<a id='line_899'>11:1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding his</a>
<a id='line_900'>twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to preach in their</a>
<a id='line_901'>cities.</a>
<a id='line_902'></a>
<a id='line_903'>11:2 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he</a>
<a id='line_904'>sent two of his disciples, 11:3 And said unto him, Art thou he that</a>
<a id='line_905'>should come, or do we look for another?  11:4 Jesus answered and said</a>
<a id='line_906'>unto them, Go and shew John again those things which ye do hear and</a>
<a id='line_907'>see: 11:5 The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers</a>
<a id='line_908'>are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor</a>
<a id='line_909'>have the gospel preached to them.</a>
<a id='line_910'></a>
<a id='line_911'>11:6 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</a>
<a id='line_912'></a>
<a id='line_913'>11:7 And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes</a>
<a id='line_914'>concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? A reed</a>
<a id='line_915'>shaken with the wind?  11:8 But what went ye out for to see? A man</a>
<a id='line_916'>clothed in soft raiment?  behold, they that wear soft clothing are in</a>
<a id='line_917'>kings’ houses.</a>
<a id='line_918'></a>
<a id='line_919'>11:9 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you,</a>
<a id='line_920'>and more than a prophet.</a>
<a id='line_921'></a>
<a id='line_922'>11:10 For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my</a>
<a id='line_923'>messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.</a>
<a id='line_924'></a>
<a id='line_925'>11:11 Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there</a>
<a id='line_926'>hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding he</a>
<a id='line_927'>that is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.</a>
<a id='line_928'></a>
<a id='line_929'>11:12 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_930'>heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.</a>
<a id='line_931'></a>
<a id='line_932'>11:13 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.</a>
<a id='line_933'></a>
<a id='line_934'>11:14 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to come.</a>
<a id='line_935'></a>
<a id='line_936'>11:15 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</a>
<a id='line_937'></a>
<a id='line_938'>11:16 But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto</a>
<a id='line_939'>children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their fellows, 11:17</a>
<a id='line_940'>And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we have</a>
<a id='line_941'>mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.</a>
<a id='line_942'></a>
<a id='line_943'>11:18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath</a>
<a id='line_944'>a devil.</a>
<a id='line_945'></a>
<a id='line_946'>11:19 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a</a>
<a id='line_947'>man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners.</a>
<a id='line_948'>But wisdom is justified of her children.</a>
<a id='line_949'></a>
<a id='line_950'>11:20 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty</a>
<a id='line_951'>works were done, because they repented not: 11:21 Woe unto thee,</a>
<a id='line_952'>Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the mighty works, which</a>
<a id='line_953'>were done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have</a>
<a id='line_954'>repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</a>
<a id='line_955'></a>
<a id='line_956'>11:22 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and</a>
<a id='line_957'>Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.</a>
<a id='line_958'></a>
<a id='line_959'>11:23 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be</a>
<a id='line_960'>brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been done in</a>
<a id='line_961'>thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.</a>
<a id='line_962'></a>
<a id='line_963'>11:24 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the land</a>
<a id='line_964'>of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.</a>
<a id='line_965'></a>
<a id='line_966'>11:25 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father,</a>
<a id='line_967'>Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the</a>
<a id='line_968'>wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.</a>
<a id='line_969'></a>
<a id='line_970'>11:26 Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.</a>
<a id='line_971'></a>
<a id='line_972'>11:27 All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man</a>
<a id='line_973'>knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father,</a>
<a id='line_974'>save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.</a>
<a id='line_975'></a>
<a id='line_976'>11:28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will</a>
<a id='line_977'>give you rest.</a>
<a id='line_978'></a>
<a id='line_979'>11:29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly</a>
<a id='line_980'>in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.</a>
<a id='line_981'></a>
<a id='line_982'>11:30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.</a>
<a id='line_983'></a>
<a id='line_984'>12:1 At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and</a>
<a id='line_985'>his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears of corn and</a>
<a id='line_986'>to eat.</a>
<a id='line_987'></a>
<a id='line_988'>12:2 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy</a>
<a id='line_989'>disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath day.</a>
<a id='line_990'></a>
<a id='line_991'>12:3 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when he</a>
<a id='line_992'>was an hungred, and they that were with him; 12:4 How he entered into</a>
<a id='line_993'>the house of God, and did eat the shewbread, which was not lawful for</a>
<a id='line_994'>him to eat, neither for them which were with him, but only for the</a>
<a id='line_995'>priests?  12:5 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath</a>
<a id='line_996'>days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?</a>
<a id='line_997'>12:6 But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the</a>
<a id='line_998'>temple.</a>
<a id='line_999'></a>
<a id='line_1000'>12:7 But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and not</a>
<a id='line_1001'>sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.</a>
<a id='line_1002'></a>
<a id='line_1003'>12:8 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.</a>
<a id='line_1004'></a>
<a id='line_1005'>12:9 And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:</a>
<a id='line_1006'>12:10 And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And</a>
<a id='line_1007'>they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath days? that</a>
<a id='line_1008'>they might accuse him.</a>
<a id='line_1009'></a>
<a id='line_1010'>12:11 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that</a>
<a id='line_1011'>shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath day,</a>
<a id='line_1012'>will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?  12:12 How much then is a</a>
<a id='line_1013'>man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is lawful to do well on the</a>
<a id='line_1014'>sabbath days.</a>
<a id='line_1015'></a>
<a id='line_1016'>12:13 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he</a>
<a id='line_1017'>stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the other.</a>
<a id='line_1018'></a>
<a id='line_1019'>12:14 Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how</a>
<a id='line_1020'>they might destroy him.</a>
<a id='line_1021'></a>
<a id='line_1022'>12:15 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and</a>
<a id='line_1023'>great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all; 12:16 And</a>
<a id='line_1024'>charged them that they should not make him known: 12:17 That it might</a>
<a id='line_1025'>be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, 12:18</a>
<a id='line_1026'>Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is</a>
<a id='line_1027'>well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew</a>
<a id='line_1028'>judgment to the Gentiles.</a>
<a id='line_1029'></a>
<a id='line_1030'>12:19 He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his</a>
<a id='line_1031'>voice in the streets.</a>
<a id='line_1032'></a>
<a id='line_1033'>12:20 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not</a>
<a id='line_1034'>quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.</a>
<a id='line_1035'></a>
<a id='line_1036'>12:21 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.</a>
<a id='line_1037'></a>
<a id='line_1038'>12:22 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind, and</a>
<a id='line_1039'>dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb both spake</a>
<a id='line_1040'>and saw.</a>
<a id='line_1041'></a>
<a id='line_1042'>12:23 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son of</a>
<a id='line_1043'>David?  12:24 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow</a>
<a id='line_1044'>doth not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.</a>
<a id='line_1045'></a>
<a id='line_1046'>12:25 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every kingdom</a>
<a id='line_1047'>divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or</a>
<a id='line_1048'>house divided against itself shall not stand: 12:26 And if Satan cast</a>
<a id='line_1049'>out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom</a>
<a id='line_1050'>stand?  12:27 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your</a>
<a id='line_1051'>children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.</a>
<a id='line_1052'></a>
<a id='line_1053'>12:28 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom</a>
<a id='line_1054'>of God is come unto you.</a>
<a id='line_1055'></a>
<a id='line_1056'>12:29 Or else how can one enter into a strong man’s house, and spoil</a>
<a id='line_1057'>his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil</a>
<a id='line_1058'>his house.</a>
<a id='line_1059'></a>
<a id='line_1060'>12:30 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth not</a>
<a id='line_1061'>with me scattereth abroad.</a>
<a id='line_1062'></a>
<a id='line_1063'>12:31 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy shall</a>
<a id='line_1064'>be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall</a>
<a id='line_1065'>not be forgiven unto men.</a>
<a id='line_1066'></a>
<a id='line_1067'>12:32 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall</a>
<a id='line_1068'>be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it</a>
<a id='line_1069'>shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world</a>
<a id='line_1070'>to come.</a>
<a id='line_1071'></a>
<a id='line_1072'>12:33 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make the</a>
<a id='line_1073'>tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known by his</a>
<a id='line_1074'>fruit.</a>
<a id='line_1075'></a>
<a id='line_1076'>12:34 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good</a>
<a id='line_1077'>things?  for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.</a>
<a id='line_1078'></a>
<a id='line_1079'>12:35 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth</a>
<a id='line_1080'>good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth</a>
<a id='line_1081'>evil things.</a>
<a id='line_1082'></a>
<a id='line_1083'>12:36 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,</a>
<a id='line_1084'>they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.</a>
<a id='line_1085'></a>
<a id='line_1086'>12:37 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou</a>
<a id='line_1087'>shalt be condemned.</a>
<a id='line_1088'></a>
<a id='line_1089'>12:38 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered,</a>
<a id='line_1090'>saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.</a>
<a id='line_1091'></a>
<a id='line_1092'>12:39 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous</a>
<a id='line_1093'>generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be given to</a>
<a id='line_1094'>it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas: 12:40 For as Jonas was three</a>
<a id='line_1095'>days and three nights in the whale’s belly; so shall the Son of man be</a>
<a id='line_1096'>three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.</a>
<a id='line_1097'></a>
<a id='line_1098'>12:41 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation,</a>
<a id='line_1099'>and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas;</a>
<a id='line_1100'>and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.</a>
<a id='line_1101'></a>
<a id='line_1102'>12:42 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this</a>
<a id='line_1103'>generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost</a>
<a id='line_1104'>parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a</a>
<a id='line_1105'>greater than Solomon is here.</a>
<a id='line_1106'></a>
<a id='line_1107'>12:43 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through</a>
<a id='line_1108'>dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.</a>
<a id='line_1109'></a>
<a id='line_1110'>12:44 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came</a>
<a id='line_1111'>out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.</a>
<a id='line_1112'></a>
<a id='line_1113'>12:45 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more</a>
<a id='line_1114'>wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last</a>
<a id='line_1115'>state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also</a>
<a id='line_1116'>unto this wicked generation.</a>
<a id='line_1117'></a>
<a id='line_1118'>12:46 While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his</a>
<a id='line_1119'>brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.</a>
<a id='line_1120'></a>
<a id='line_1121'>12:47 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren</a>
<a id='line_1122'>stand without, desiring to speak with thee.</a>
<a id='line_1123'></a>
<a id='line_1124'>12:48 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my</a>
<a id='line_1125'>mother?  and who are my brethren?  12:49 And he stretched forth his</a>
<a id='line_1126'>hand toward his disciples, and said, Behold my mother and my brethren!</a>
<a id='line_1127'>12:50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven,</a>
<a id='line_1128'>the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.</a>
<a id='line_1129'></a>
<a id='line_1130'>13:1 The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea</a>
<a id='line_1131'>side.</a>
<a id='line_1132'></a>
<a id='line_1133'>13:2 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that he</a>
<a id='line_1134'>went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on the shore.</a>
<a id='line_1135'></a>
<a id='line_1136'>13:3 And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a</a>
<a id='line_1137'>sower went forth to sow; 13:4 And when he sowed, some seeds fell by</a>
<a id='line_1138'>the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up: 13:5 Some fell</a>
<a id='line_1139'>upon stony places, where they had not much earth: and forthwith they</a>
<a id='line_1140'>sprung up, because they had no deepness of earth: 13:6 And when the</a>
<a id='line_1141'>sun was up, they were scorched; and because they had no root, they</a>
<a id='line_1142'>withered away.</a>
<a id='line_1143'></a>
<a id='line_1144'>13:7 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and choked</a>
<a id='line_1145'>them: 13:8 But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit,</a>
<a id='line_1146'>some an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.</a>
<a id='line_1147'></a>
<a id='line_1148'>13:9 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</a>
<a id='line_1149'></a>
<a id='line_1150'>13:10 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou</a>
<a id='line_1151'>unto them in parables?  13:11 He answered and said unto them, Because</a>
<a id='line_1152'>it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven,</a>
<a id='line_1153'>but to them it is not given.</a>
<a id='line_1154'></a>
<a id='line_1155'>13:12 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have</a>
<a id='line_1156'>more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken away</a>
<a id='line_1157'>even that he hath.</a>
<a id='line_1158'></a>
<a id='line_1159'>13:13 Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see</a>
<a id='line_1160'>not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.</a>
<a id='line_1161'></a>
<a id='line_1162'>13:14 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith, By</a>
<a id='line_1163'>hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall</a>
<a id='line_1164'>see, and shall not perceive: 13:15 For this people’s heart is waxed</a>
<a id='line_1165'>gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have</a>
<a id='line_1166'>closed; lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with</a>
<a id='line_1167'>their ears, and should understand with their heart, and should be</a>
<a id='line_1168'>converted, and I should heal them.</a>
<a id='line_1169'></a>
<a id='line_1170'>13:16 But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for they</a>
<a id='line_1171'>hear.</a>
<a id='line_1172'></a>
<a id='line_1173'>13:17 For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous men</a>
<a id='line_1174'>have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them;</a>
<a id='line_1175'>and to hear those things which ye hear, and have not heard them.</a>
<a id='line_1176'></a>
<a id='line_1177'>13:18 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.</a>
<a id='line_1178'></a>
<a id='line_1179'>13:19 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth</a>
<a id='line_1180'>it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth away that which was</a>
<a id='line_1181'>sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.</a>
<a id='line_1182'></a>
<a id='line_1183'>13:20 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is he</a>
<a id='line_1184'>that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it; 13:21 Yet hath</a>
<a id='line_1185'>he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for when tribulation</a>
<a id='line_1186'>or persecution ariseth because of the word, by and by he is offended.</a>
<a id='line_1187'></a>
<a id='line_1188'>13:22 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth</a>
<a id='line_1189'>the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches,</a>
<a id='line_1190'>choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.</a>
<a id='line_1191'></a>
<a id='line_1192'>13:23 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that</a>
<a id='line_1193'>heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth fruit, and</a>
<a id='line_1194'>bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty.</a>
<a id='line_1195'></a>
<a id='line_1196'>13:24 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_1197'>heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his field: 13:25</a>
<a id='line_1198'>But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat,</a>
<a id='line_1199'>and went his way.</a>
<a id='line_1200'></a>
<a id='line_1201'>13:26 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then</a>
<a id='line_1202'>appeared the tares also.</a>
<a id='line_1203'></a>
<a id='line_1204'>13:27 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir,</a>
<a id='line_1205'>didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it</a>
<a id='line_1206'>tares?  13:28 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants</a>
<a id='line_1207'>said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?  13:29</a>
<a id='line_1208'>But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also</a>
<a id='line_1209'>the wheat with them.</a>
<a id='line_1210'></a>
<a id='line_1211'>13:30 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of</a>
<a id='line_1212'>harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares,</a>
<a id='line_1213'>and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the wheat into my</a>
<a id='line_1214'>barn.</a>
<a id='line_1215'></a>
<a id='line_1216'>13:31 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_1217'>heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed</a>
<a id='line_1218'>in his field: 13:32 Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when</a>
<a id='line_1219'>it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so</a>
<a id='line_1220'>that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.</a>
<a id='line_1221'></a>
<a id='line_1222'>13:33 Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is</a>
<a id='line_1223'>like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of</a>
<a id='line_1224'>meal, till the whole was leavened.</a>
<a id='line_1225'></a>
<a id='line_1226'>13:34 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and</a>
<a id='line_1227'>without a parable spake he not unto them: 13:35 That it might be</a>
<a id='line_1228'>fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my</a>
<a id='line_1229'>mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret</a>
<a id='line_1230'>from the foundation of the world.</a>
<a id='line_1231'></a>
<a id='line_1232'>13:36 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house: and</a>
<a id='line_1233'>his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the parable of</a>
<a id='line_1234'>the tares of the field.</a>
<a id='line_1235'></a>
<a id='line_1236'>13:37 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed is</a>
<a id='line_1237'>the Son of man; 13:38 The field is the world; the good seed are the</a>
<a id='line_1238'>children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked</a>
<a id='line_1239'>one; 13:39 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the</a>
<a id='line_1240'>end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.</a>
<a id='line_1241'></a>
<a id='line_1242'>13:40 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so</a>
<a id='line_1243'>shall it be in the end of this world.</a>
<a id='line_1244'></a>
<a id='line_1245'>13:41 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall</a>
<a id='line_1246'>gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do</a>
<a id='line_1247'>iniquity; 13:42 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there</a>
<a id='line_1248'>shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.</a>
<a id='line_1249'></a>
<a id='line_1250'>13:43 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom</a>
<a id='line_1251'>of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</a>
<a id='line_1252'></a>
<a id='line_1253'>13:44 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a</a>
<a id='line_1254'>field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof</a>
<a id='line_1255'>goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field.</a>
<a id='line_1256'></a>
<a id='line_1257'>13:45 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,</a>
<a id='line_1258'>seeking goodly pearls: 13:46 Who, when he had found one pearl of great</a>
<a id='line_1259'>price, went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</a>
<a id='line_1260'></a>
<a id='line_1261'>13:47 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast</a>
<a id='line_1262'>into the sea, and gathered of every kind: 13:48 Which, when it was</a>
<a id='line_1263'>full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and gathered the good into</a>
<a id='line_1264'>vessels, but cast the bad away.</a>
<a id='line_1265'></a>
<a id='line_1266'>13:49 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come</a>
<a id='line_1267'>forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, 13:50 And shall cast</a>
<a id='line_1268'>them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of</a>
<a id='line_1269'>teeth.</a>
<a id='line_1270'></a>
<a id='line_1271'>13:51 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things? They</a>
<a id='line_1272'>say unto him, Yea, Lord.</a>
<a id='line_1273'></a>
<a id='line_1274'>13:52 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is</a>
<a id='line_1275'>instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an</a>
<a id='line_1276'>householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure things new and</a>
<a id='line_1277'>old.</a>
<a id='line_1278'></a>
<a id='line_1279'>13:53 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these</a>
<a id='line_1280'>parables, he departed thence.</a>
<a id='line_1281'></a>
<a id='line_1282'>13:54 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in</a>
<a id='line_1283'>their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence</a>
<a id='line_1284'>hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?  13:55 Is not this</a>
<a id='line_1285'>the carpenter’s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren,</a>
<a id='line_1286'>James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?  13:56 And his sisters, are</a>
<a id='line_1287'>they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things?</a>
<a id='line_1288'>13:57 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A</a>
<a id='line_1289'>prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in his own</a>
<a id='line_1290'>house.</a>
<a id='line_1291'></a>
<a id='line_1292'>13:58 And he did not many mighty works there because of their</a>
<a id='line_1293'>unbelief.</a>
<a id='line_1294'></a>
<a id='line_1295'>14:1 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus, 14:2</a>
<a id='line_1296'>And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is risen from</a>
<a id='line_1297'>the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him.</a>
<a id='line_1298'></a>
<a id='line_1299'>14:3 For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in</a>
<a id='line_1300'>prison for Herodias’ sake, his brother Philip’s wife.</a>
<a id='line_1301'></a>
<a id='line_1302'>14:4 For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.</a>
<a id='line_1303'></a>
<a id='line_1304'>14:5 And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude,</a>
<a id='line_1305'>because they counted him as a prophet.</a>
<a id='line_1306'></a>
<a id='line_1307'>14:6 But when Herod’s birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias</a>
<a id='line_1308'>danced before them, and pleased Herod.</a>
<a id='line_1309'></a>
<a id='line_1310'>14:7 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she</a>
<a id='line_1311'>would ask.</a>
<a id='line_1312'></a>
<a id='line_1313'>14:8 And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me</a>
<a id='line_1314'>here John Baptist’s head in a charger.</a>
<a id='line_1315'></a>
<a id='line_1316'>14:9 And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath’s sake, and</a>
<a id='line_1317'>them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.</a>
<a id='line_1318'></a>
<a id='line_1319'>14:10 And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.</a>
<a id='line_1320'></a>
<a id='line_1321'>14:11 And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the damsel:</a>
<a id='line_1322'>and she brought it to her mother.</a>
<a id='line_1323'></a>
<a id='line_1324'>14:12 And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it, and</a>
<a id='line_1325'>went and told Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_1326'></a>
<a id='line_1327'>14:13 When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert</a>
<a id='line_1328'>place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him</a>
<a id='line_1329'>on foot out of the cities.</a>
<a id='line_1330'></a>
<a id='line_1331'>14:14 And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved</a>
<a id='line_1332'>with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.</a>
<a id='line_1333'></a>
<a id='line_1334'>14:15 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying, This</a>
<a id='line_1335'>is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the multitude away,</a>
<a id='line_1336'>that they may go into the villages, and buy themselves victuals.</a>
<a id='line_1337'></a>
<a id='line_1338'>14:16 But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them to</a>
<a id='line_1339'>eat.</a>
<a id='line_1340'></a>
<a id='line_1341'>14:17 And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two</a>
<a id='line_1342'>fishes.</a>
<a id='line_1343'></a>
<a id='line_1344'>14:18 He said, Bring them hither to me.</a>
<a id='line_1345'></a>
<a id='line_1346'>14:19 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and</a>
<a id='line_1347'>took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he</a>
<a id='line_1348'>blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his disciples, and the</a>
<a id='line_1349'>disciples to the multitude.</a>
<a id='line_1350'></a>
<a id='line_1351'>14:20 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the</a>
<a id='line_1352'>fragments that remained twelve baskets full.</a>
<a id='line_1353'></a>
<a id='line_1354'>14:21 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside</a>
<a id='line_1355'>women and children.</a>
<a id='line_1356'></a>
<a id='line_1357'>14:22 And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a</a>
<a id='line_1358'>ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the</a>
<a id='line_1359'>multitudes away.</a>
<a id='line_1360'></a>
<a id='line_1361'>14:23 And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a</a>
<a id='line_1362'>mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there</a>
<a id='line_1363'>alone.</a>
<a id='line_1364'></a>
<a id='line_1365'>14:24 But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves:</a>
<a id='line_1366'>for the wind was contrary.</a>
<a id='line_1367'></a>
<a id='line_1368'>14:25 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them,</a>
<a id='line_1369'>walking on the sea.</a>
<a id='line_1370'></a>
<a id='line_1371'>14:26 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were</a>
<a id='line_1372'>troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.</a>
<a id='line_1373'></a>
<a id='line_1374'>14:27 But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer;</a>
<a id='line_1375'>it is I; be not afraid.</a>
<a id='line_1376'></a>
<a id='line_1377'>14:28 And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me</a>
<a id='line_1378'>come unto thee on the water.</a>
<a id='line_1379'></a>
<a id='line_1380'>14:29 And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship,</a>
<a id='line_1381'>he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_1382'></a>
<a id='line_1383'>14:30 But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and</a>
<a id='line_1384'>beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.</a>
<a id='line_1385'></a>
<a id='line_1386'>14:31 And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him,</a>
<a id='line_1387'>and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?</a>
<a id='line_1388'>14:32 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.</a>
<a id='line_1389'></a>
<a id='line_1390'>14:33 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1391'>Of a truth thou art the Son of God.</a>
<a id='line_1392'></a>
<a id='line_1393'>14:34 And when they were gone over, they came into the land of</a>
<a id='line_1394'>Gennesaret.</a>
<a id='line_1395'></a>
<a id='line_1396'>14:35 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent</a>
<a id='line_1397'>out into all that country round about, and brought unto him all that</a>
<a id='line_1398'>were diseased; 14:36 And besought him that they might only touch the</a>
<a id='line_1399'>hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.</a>
<a id='line_1400'></a>
<a id='line_1401'>15:1 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of</a>
<a id='line_1402'>Jerusalem, saying, 15:2 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition</a>
<a id='line_1403'>of the elders? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.</a>
<a id='line_1404'></a>
<a id='line_1405'>15:3 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress the</a>
<a id='line_1406'>commandment of God by your tradition?  15:4 For God commanded, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1407'>Honour thy father and mother: and, He that curseth father or mother,</a>
<a id='line_1408'>let him die the death.</a>
<a id='line_1409'></a>
<a id='line_1410'>15:5 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother, It</a>
<a id='line_1411'>is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; 15:6 And</a>
<a id='line_1412'>honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free. Thus have ye</a>
<a id='line_1413'>made the commandment of God of none effect by your tradition.</a>
<a id='line_1414'></a>
<a id='line_1415'>15:7 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying, 15:8 This</a>
<a id='line_1416'>people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with</a>
<a id='line_1417'>their lips; but their heart is far from me.</a>
<a id='line_1418'></a>
<a id='line_1419'>15:9 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the</a>
<a id='line_1420'>commandments of men.</a>
<a id='line_1421'></a>
<a id='line_1422'>15:10 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and</a>
<a id='line_1423'>understand: 15:11 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man;</a>
<a id='line_1424'>but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.</a>
<a id='line_1425'></a>
<a id='line_1426'>15:12 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that</a>
<a id='line_1427'>the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?  15:13 But</a>
<a id='line_1428'>he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly Father hath not</a>
<a id='line_1429'>planted, shall be rooted up.</a>
<a id='line_1430'></a>
<a id='line_1431'>15:14 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the</a>
<a id='line_1432'>blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.</a>
<a id='line_1433'></a>
<a id='line_1434'>15:15 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this</a>
<a id='line_1435'>parable.</a>
<a id='line_1436'></a>
<a id='line_1437'>15:16 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?  15:17 Do</a>
<a id='line_1438'>not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the mouth goeth</a>
<a id='line_1439'>into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?  15:18 But those</a>
<a id='line_1440'>things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart; and</a>
<a id='line_1441'>they defile the man.</a>
<a id='line_1442'></a>
<a id='line_1443'>15:19 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries,</a>
<a id='line_1444'>fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies: 15:20 These are the</a>
<a id='line_1445'>things which defile a man: but to eat with unwashen hands defileth not</a>
<a id='line_1446'>a man.</a>
<a id='line_1447'></a>
<a id='line_1448'>15:21 Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and</a>
<a id='line_1449'>Sidon.</a>
<a id='line_1450'></a>
<a id='line_1451'>15:22 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and</a>
<a id='line_1452'>cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son of David;</a>
<a id='line_1453'>my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.</a>
<a id='line_1454'></a>
<a id='line_1455'>15:23 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and</a>
<a id='line_1456'>besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.</a>
<a id='line_1457'></a>
<a id='line_1458'>15:24 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep</a>
<a id='line_1459'>of the house of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1460'></a>
<a id='line_1461'>15:25 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</a>
<a id='line_1462'></a>
<a id='line_1463'>15:26 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s</a>
<a id='line_1464'>bread, and to cast it to dogs.</a>
<a id='line_1465'></a>
<a id='line_1466'>15:27 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which</a>
<a id='line_1467'>fall from their masters’ table.</a>
<a id='line_1468'></a>
<a id='line_1469'>15:28 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy</a>
<a id='line_1470'>faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made</a>
<a id='line_1471'>whole from that very hour.</a>
<a id='line_1472'></a>
<a id='line_1473'>15:29 And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of</a>
<a id='line_1474'>Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.</a>
<a id='line_1475'></a>
<a id='line_1476'>15:30 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those that</a>
<a id='line_1477'>were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast them down at</a>
<a id='line_1478'>Jesus’ feet; and he healed them: 15:31 Insomuch that the multitude</a>
<a id='line_1479'>wondered, when they saw the dumb to speak, the maimed to be whole, the</a>
<a id='line_1480'>lame to walk, and the blind to see: and they glorified the God of</a>
<a id='line_1481'>Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1482'></a>
<a id='line_1483'>15:32 Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have</a>
<a id='line_1484'>compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three</a>
<a id='line_1485'>days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting,</a>
<a id='line_1486'>lest they faint in the way.</a>
<a id='line_1487'></a>
<a id='line_1488'>15:33 And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much</a>
<a id='line_1489'>bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?  15:34 And</a>
<a id='line_1490'>Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they said, Seven,</a>
<a id='line_1491'>and a few little fishes.</a>
<a id='line_1492'></a>
<a id='line_1493'>15:35 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_1494'></a>
<a id='line_1495'>15:36 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks,</a>
<a id='line_1496'>and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples to the</a>
<a id='line_1497'>multitude.</a>
<a id='line_1498'></a>
<a id='line_1499'>15:37 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the</a>
<a id='line_1500'>broken meat that was left seven baskets full.</a>
<a id='line_1501'></a>
<a id='line_1502'>15:38 And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and</a>
<a id='line_1503'>children.</a>
<a id='line_1504'></a>
<a id='line_1505'>15:39 And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into the</a>
<a id='line_1506'>coasts of Magdala.</a>
<a id='line_1507'></a>
<a id='line_1508'>16:1 The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting desired</a>
<a id='line_1509'>him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1510'></a>
<a id='line_1511'>16:2 He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It</a>
<a id='line_1512'>will be fair weather: for the sky is red.</a>
<a id='line_1513'></a>
<a id='line_1514'>16:3 And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the sky</a>
<a id='line_1515'>is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the face of the</a>
<a id='line_1516'>sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?  16:4 A wicked and</a>
<a id='line_1517'>adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be</a>
<a id='line_1518'>given unto it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas. And he left them,</a>
<a id='line_1519'>and departed.</a>
<a id='line_1520'></a>
<a id='line_1521'>16:5 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had</a>
<a id='line_1522'>forgotten to take bread.</a>
<a id='line_1523'></a>
<a id='line_1524'>16:6 Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven of</a>
<a id='line_1525'>the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</a>
<a id='line_1526'></a>
<a id='line_1527'>16:7 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have</a>
<a id='line_1528'>taken no bread.</a>
<a id='line_1529'></a>
<a id='line_1530'>16:8 Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little</a>
<a id='line_1531'>faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought no</a>
<a id='line_1532'>bread?  16:9 Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five</a>
<a id='line_1533'>loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?  16:10</a>
<a id='line_1534'>Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye</a>
<a id='line_1535'>took up?  16:11 How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it</a>
<a id='line_1536'>not to you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of</a>
<a id='line_1537'>the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?  16:12 Then understood they how</a>
<a id='line_1538'>that he bade them not beware of the leaven of bread, but of the</a>
<a id='line_1539'>doctrine of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</a>
<a id='line_1540'></a>
<a id='line_1541'>16:13 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked</a>
<a id='line_1542'>his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?</a>
<a id='line_1543'>16:14 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some,</a>
<a id='line_1544'>Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.</a>
<a id='line_1545'></a>
<a id='line_1546'>16:15 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?  16:16 And Simon</a>
<a id='line_1547'>Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living</a>
<a id='line_1548'>God.</a>
<a id='line_1549'></a>
<a id='line_1550'>16:17 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon</a>
<a id='line_1551'>Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my</a>
<a id='line_1552'>Father which is in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1553'></a>
<a id='line_1554'>16:18 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this</a>
<a id='line_1555'>rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail</a>
<a id='line_1556'>against it.</a>
<a id='line_1557'></a>
<a id='line_1558'>16:19 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and</a>
<a id='line_1559'>whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and</a>
<a id='line_1560'>whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1561'></a>
<a id='line_1562'>16:20 Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that</a>
<a id='line_1563'>he was Jesus the Christ.</a>
<a id='line_1564'></a>
<a id='line_1565'>16:21 From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples, how</a>
<a id='line_1566'>that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of the elders</a>
<a id='line_1567'>and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised again the</a>
<a id='line_1568'>third day.</a>
<a id='line_1569'></a>
<a id='line_1570'>16:22 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it far</a>
<a id='line_1571'>from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.</a>
<a id='line_1572'></a>
<a id='line_1573'>16:23 But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:</a>
<a id='line_1574'>thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things that be</a>
<a id='line_1575'>of God, but those that be of men.</a>
<a id='line_1576'></a>
<a id='line_1577'>16:24 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after</a>
<a id='line_1578'>me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</a>
<a id='line_1579'></a>
<a id='line_1580'>16:25 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever</a>
<a id='line_1581'>will lose his life for my sake shall find it.</a>
<a id='line_1582'></a>
<a id='line_1583'>16:26 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,</a>
<a id='line_1584'>and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his</a>
<a id='line_1585'>soul?  16:27 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father</a>
<a id='line_1586'>with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his</a>
<a id='line_1587'>works.</a>
<a id='line_1588'></a>
<a id='line_1589'>16:28 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which shall</a>
<a id='line_1590'>not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his</a>
<a id='line_1591'>kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_1592'></a>
<a id='line_1593'>17:1 And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his</a>
<a id='line_1594'>brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, 17:2 And</a>
<a id='line_1595'>was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and</a>
<a id='line_1596'>his raiment was white as the light.</a>
<a id='line_1597'></a>
<a id='line_1598'>17:3 And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking</a>
<a id='line_1599'>with him.</a>
<a id='line_1600'></a>
<a id='line_1601'>17:4 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us</a>
<a id='line_1602'>to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for</a>
<a id='line_1603'>thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias.</a>
<a id='line_1604'></a>
<a id='line_1605'>17:5 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and</a>
<a id='line_1606'>behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son,</a>
<a id='line_1607'>in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.</a>
<a id='line_1608'></a>
<a id='line_1609'>17:6 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and</a>
<a id='line_1610'>were sore afraid.</a>
<a id='line_1611'></a>
<a id='line_1612'>17:7 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not</a>
<a id='line_1613'>afraid.</a>
<a id='line_1614'></a>
<a id='line_1615'>17:8 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save</a>
<a id='line_1616'>Jesus only.</a>
<a id='line_1617'></a>
<a id='line_1618'>17:9 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them,</a>
<a id='line_1619'>saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again</a>
<a id='line_1620'>from the dead.</a>
<a id='line_1621'></a>
<a id='line_1622'>17:10 And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes</a>
<a id='line_1623'>that Elias must first come?  17:11 And Jesus answered and said unto</a>
<a id='line_1624'>them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.</a>
<a id='line_1625'></a>
<a id='line_1626'>17:12 But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew</a>
<a id='line_1627'>him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed. Likewise shall</a>
<a id='line_1628'>also the Son of man suffer of them.</a>
<a id='line_1629'></a>
<a id='line_1630'>17:13 Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John</a>
<a id='line_1631'>the Baptist.</a>
<a id='line_1632'></a>
<a id='line_1633'>17:14 And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a</a>
<a id='line_1634'>certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying, 17:15 Lord, have mercy</a>
<a id='line_1635'>on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore vexed: for ofttimes he falleth</a>
<a id='line_1636'>into the fire, and oft into the water.</a>
<a id='line_1637'></a>
<a id='line_1638'>17:16 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure him.</a>
<a id='line_1639'></a>
<a id='line_1640'>17:17 Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse</a>
<a id='line_1641'>generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you?</a>
<a id='line_1642'>bring him hither to me.</a>
<a id='line_1643'></a>
<a id='line_1644'>17:18 And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and the</a>
<a id='line_1645'>child was cured from that very hour.</a>
<a id='line_1646'></a>
<a id='line_1647'>17:19 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could not</a>
<a id='line_1648'>we cast him out?  17:20 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your</a>
<a id='line_1649'>unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of</a>
<a id='line_1650'>mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder</a>
<a id='line_1651'>place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.</a>
<a id='line_1652'></a>
<a id='line_1653'>17:21 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.</a>
<a id='line_1654'></a>
<a id='line_1655'>17:22 And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son</a>
<a id='line_1656'>of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men: 17:23 And they shall</a>
<a id='line_1657'>kill him, and the third day he shall be raised again.</a>
<a id='line_1658'></a>
<a id='line_1659'>And they were exceeding sorry.</a>
<a id='line_1660'></a>
<a id='line_1661'>17:24 And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute</a>
<a id='line_1662'>money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master pay tribute?</a>
<a id='line_1663'>17:25 He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus</a>
<a id='line_1664'>prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do the kings</a>
<a id='line_1665'>of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own children, or of</a>
<a id='line_1666'>strangers?  17:26 Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto</a>
<a id='line_1667'>him, Then are the children free.</a>
<a id='line_1668'></a>
<a id='line_1669'>17:27 Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the sea,</a>
<a id='line_1670'>and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh up; and when</a>
<a id='line_1671'>thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a piece of money: that</a>
<a id='line_1672'>take, and give unto them for me and thee.</a>
<a id='line_1673'></a>
<a id='line_1674'>18:1 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is</a>
<a id='line_1675'>the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?  18:2 And Jesus called a little</a>
<a id='line_1676'>child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, 18:3 And said,</a>
<a id='line_1677'>Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little</a>
<a id='line_1678'>children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1679'></a>
<a id='line_1680'>18:4 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,</a>
<a id='line_1681'>the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1682'></a>
<a id='line_1683'>18:5 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name</a>
<a id='line_1684'>receiveth me.</a>
<a id='line_1685'></a>
<a id='line_1686'>18:6 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in</a>
<a id='line_1687'>me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his</a>
<a id='line_1688'>neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.</a>
<a id='line_1689'></a>
<a id='line_1690'>18:7 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that</a>
<a id='line_1691'>offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh!  18:8</a>
<a id='line_1692'>Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast</a>
<a id='line_1693'>them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or</a>
<a id='line_1694'>maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into</a>
<a id='line_1695'>everlasting fire.</a>
<a id='line_1696'></a>
<a id='line_1697'>18:9 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from</a>
<a id='line_1698'>thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather</a>
<a id='line_1699'>than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.</a>
<a id='line_1700'></a>
<a id='line_1701'>18:10 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I</a>
<a id='line_1702'>say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of</a>
<a id='line_1703'>my Father which is in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1704'></a>
<a id='line_1705'>18:11 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.</a>
<a id='line_1706'></a>
<a id='line_1707'>18:12 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them be</a>
<a id='line_1708'>gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the</a>
<a id='line_1709'>mountains, and seeketh that which is gone astray?  18:13 And if so be</a>
<a id='line_1710'>that he find it, verily I say unto you, he rejoiceth more of that</a>
<a id='line_1711'>sheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not astray.</a>
<a id='line_1712'></a>
<a id='line_1713'>18:14 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven,</a>
<a id='line_1714'>that one of these little ones should perish.</a>
<a id='line_1715'></a>
<a id='line_1716'>18:15 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and tell</a>
<a id='line_1717'>him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall hear thee, thou</a>
<a id='line_1718'>hast gained thy brother.</a>
<a id='line_1719'></a>
<a id='line_1720'>18:16 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two</a>
<a id='line_1721'>more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be</a>
<a id='line_1722'>established.</a>
<a id='line_1723'></a>
<a id='line_1724'>18:17 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church:</a>
<a id='line_1725'>but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an</a>
<a id='line_1726'>heathen man and a publican.</a>
<a id='line_1727'></a>
<a id='line_1728'>18:18 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall</a>
<a id='line_1729'>be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be</a>
<a id='line_1730'>loosed in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1731'></a>
<a id='line_1732'>18:19 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as</a>
<a id='line_1733'>touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of</a>
<a id='line_1734'>my Father which is in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1735'></a>
<a id='line_1736'>18:20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there</a>
<a id='line_1737'>am I in the midst of them.</a>
<a id='line_1738'></a>
<a id='line_1739'>18:21 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother</a>
<a id='line_1740'>sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?  18:22 Jesus</a>
<a id='line_1741'>saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until</a>
<a id='line_1742'>seventy times seven.</a>
<a id='line_1743'></a>
<a id='line_1744'>18:23 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain king,</a>
<a id='line_1745'>which would take account of his servants.</a>
<a id='line_1746'></a>
<a id='line_1747'>18:24 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him, which</a>
<a id='line_1748'>owed him ten thousand talents.</a>
<a id='line_1749'></a>
<a id='line_1750'>18:25 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be</a>
<a id='line_1751'>sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and payment to</a>
<a id='line_1752'>be made.</a>
<a id='line_1753'></a>
<a id='line_1754'>18:26 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying,</a>
<a id='line_1755'>Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</a>
<a id='line_1756'></a>
<a id='line_1757'>18:27 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and</a>
<a id='line_1758'>loosed him, and forgave him the debt.</a>
<a id='line_1759'></a>
<a id='line_1760'>18:28 But the same servant went out, and found one of his</a>
<a id='line_1761'>fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid hands on</a>
<a id='line_1762'>him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou owest.</a>
<a id='line_1763'></a>
<a id='line_1764'>18:29 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him,</a>
<a id='line_1765'>saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.</a>
<a id='line_1766'></a>
<a id='line_1767'>18:30 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he</a>
<a id='line_1768'>should pay the debt.</a>
<a id='line_1769'></a>
<a id='line_1770'>18:31 So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very</a>
<a id='line_1771'>sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.</a>
<a id='line_1772'></a>
<a id='line_1773'>18:32 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O</a>
<a id='line_1774'>thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou</a>
<a id='line_1775'>desiredst me: 18:33 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy</a>
<a id='line_1776'>fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?  18:34 And his lord was</a>
<a id='line_1777'>wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay all</a>
<a id='line_1778'>that was due unto him.</a>
<a id='line_1779'></a>
<a id='line_1780'>18:35 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye</a>
<a id='line_1781'>from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</a>
<a id='line_1782'></a>
<a id='line_1783'>19:1 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these sayings,</a>
<a id='line_1784'>he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Judaea beyond</a>
<a id='line_1785'>Jordan; 19:2 And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them</a>
<a id='line_1786'>there.</a>
<a id='line_1787'></a>
<a id='line_1788'>19:3 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying unto</a>
<a id='line_1789'>him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?</a>
<a id='line_1790'>19:4 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he</a>
<a id='line_1791'>which made them at the beginning made them male and female, 19:5 And</a>
<a id='line_1792'>said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall</a>
<a id='line_1793'>cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one flesh?  19:6 Wherefore</a>
<a id='line_1794'>they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined</a>
<a id='line_1795'>together, let not man put asunder.</a>
<a id='line_1796'></a>
<a id='line_1797'>19:7 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a writing</a>
<a id='line_1798'>of divorcement, and to put her away?  19:8 He saith unto them, Moses</a>
<a id='line_1799'>because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your</a>
<a id='line_1800'>wives: but from the beginning it was not so.</a>
<a id='line_1801'></a>
<a id='line_1802'>19:9 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it</a>
<a id='line_1803'>be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and</a>
<a id='line_1804'>whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery.</a>
<a id='line_1805'></a>
<a id='line_1806'>19:10 His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with</a>
<a id='line_1807'>his wife, it is not good to marry.</a>
<a id='line_1808'></a>
<a id='line_1809'>19:11 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying, save</a>
<a id='line_1810'>they to whom it is given.</a>
<a id='line_1811'></a>
<a id='line_1812'>19:12 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their</a>
<a id='line_1813'>mother’s womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of</a>
<a id='line_1814'>men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the</a>
<a id='line_1815'>kingdom of heaven’s sake. He that is able to receive it, let him</a>
<a id='line_1816'>receive it.</a>
<a id='line_1817'></a>
<a id='line_1818'>19:13 Then were there brought unto him little children, that he should</a>
<a id='line_1819'>put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.</a>
<a id='line_1820'></a>
<a id='line_1821'>19:14 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to</a>
<a id='line_1822'>come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1823'></a>
<a id='line_1824'>19:15 And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.</a>
<a id='line_1825'></a>
<a id='line_1826'>19:16 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good</a>
<a id='line_1827'>thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?  19:17 And he said</a>
<a id='line_1828'>unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that</a>
<a id='line_1829'>is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.</a>
<a id='line_1830'></a>
<a id='line_1831'>19:18 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,</a>
<a id='line_1832'>Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not</a>
<a id='line_1833'>bear false witness, 19:19 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou</a>
<a id='line_1834'>shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</a>
<a id='line_1835'></a>
<a id='line_1836'>19:20 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept from</a>
<a id='line_1837'>my youth up: what lack I yet?  19:21 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt</a>
<a id='line_1838'>be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou</a>
<a id='line_1839'>shalt have treasure in heaven: and come and follow me.</a>
<a id='line_1840'></a>
<a id='line_1841'>19:22 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away</a>
<a id='line_1842'>sorrowful: for he had great possessions.</a>
<a id='line_1843'></a>
<a id='line_1844'>19:23 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That</a>
<a id='line_1845'>a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_1846'></a>
<a id='line_1847'>19:24 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go through</a>
<a id='line_1848'>the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of</a>
<a id='line_1849'>God.</a>
<a id='line_1850'></a>
<a id='line_1851'>19:25 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed,</a>
<a id='line_1852'>saying, Who then can be saved?  19:26 But Jesus beheld them, and said</a>
<a id='line_1853'>unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are</a>
<a id='line_1854'>possible.</a>
<a id='line_1855'></a>
<a id='line_1856'>19:27 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have forsaken</a>
<a id='line_1857'>all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?  19:28 And Jesus</a>
<a id='line_1858'>said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which have followed me,</a>
<a id='line_1859'>in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his</a>
<a id='line_1860'>glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve</a>
<a id='line_1861'>tribes of Israel.</a>
<a id='line_1862'></a>
<a id='line_1863'>19:29 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or</a>
<a id='line_1864'>sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my</a>
<a id='line_1865'>name’s sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall inherit</a>
<a id='line_1866'>everlasting life.</a>
<a id='line_1867'></a>
<a id='line_1868'>19:30 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be</a>
<a id='line_1869'>first.</a>
<a id='line_1870'></a>
<a id='line_1871'>20:1 For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an</a>
<a id='line_1872'>householder, which went out early in the morning to hire labourers</a>
<a id='line_1873'>into his vineyard.</a>
<a id='line_1874'></a>
<a id='line_1875'>20:2 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day, he</a>
<a id='line_1876'>sent them into his vineyard.</a>
<a id='line_1877'></a>
<a id='line_1878'>20:3 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing</a>
<a id='line_1879'>idle in the marketplace, 20:4 And said unto them; Go ye also into the</a>
<a id='line_1880'>vineyard, and whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their</a>
<a id='line_1881'>way.</a>
<a id='line_1882'></a>
<a id='line_1883'>20:5 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did</a>
<a id='line_1884'>likewise.</a>
<a id='line_1885'></a>
<a id='line_1886'>20:6 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others</a>
<a id='line_1887'>standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the day</a>
<a id='line_1888'>idle?  20:7 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith</a>
<a id='line_1889'>unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right, that</a>
<a id='line_1890'>shall ye receive.</a>
<a id='line_1891'></a>
<a id='line_1892'>20:8 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his</a>
<a id='line_1893'>steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire, beginning from</a>
<a id='line_1894'>the last unto the first.</a>
<a id='line_1895'></a>
<a id='line_1896'>20:9 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour, they</a>
<a id='line_1897'>received every man a penny.</a>
<a id='line_1898'></a>
<a id='line_1899'>20:10 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have</a>
<a id='line_1900'>received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.</a>
<a id='line_1901'></a>
<a id='line_1902'>20:11 And when they had received it, they murmured against the goodman</a>
<a id='line_1903'>of the house, 20:12 Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and</a>
<a id='line_1904'>thou hast made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and</a>
<a id='line_1905'>heat of the day.</a>
<a id='line_1906'></a>
<a id='line_1907'>20:13 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no</a>
<a id='line_1908'>wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?  20:14 Take that</a>
<a id='line_1909'>thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this last, even as unto</a>
<a id='line_1910'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_1911'></a>
<a id='line_1912'>20:15 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is</a>
<a id='line_1913'>thine eye evil, because I am good?  20:16 So the last shall be first,</a>
<a id='line_1914'>and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.</a>
<a id='line_1915'></a>
<a id='line_1916'>20:17 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart</a>
<a id='line_1917'>in the way, and said unto them, 20:18 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem;</a>
<a id='line_1918'>and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto</a>
<a id='line_1919'>the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, 20:19 And shall</a>
<a id='line_1920'>deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify</a>
<a id='line_1921'>him: and the third day he shall rise again.</a>
<a id='line_1922'></a>
<a id='line_1923'>20:20 Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons,</a>
<a id='line_1924'>worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.</a>
<a id='line_1925'></a>
<a id='line_1926'>20:21 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him, Grant</a>
<a id='line_1927'>that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right hand, and the</a>
<a id='line_1928'>other on the left, in thy kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_1929'></a>
<a id='line_1930'>20:22 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye</a>
<a id='line_1931'>able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized</a>
<a id='line_1932'>with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say unto him, We are</a>
<a id='line_1933'>able.</a>
<a id='line_1934'></a>
<a id='line_1935'>20:23 And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and be</a>
<a id='line_1936'>baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to sit on my</a>
<a id='line_1937'>right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but it shall be given</a>
<a id='line_1938'>to them for whom it is prepared of my Father.</a>
<a id='line_1939'></a>
<a id='line_1940'>20:24 And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation</a>
<a id='line_1941'>against the two brethren.</a>
<a id='line_1942'></a>
<a id='line_1943'>20:25 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the</a>
<a id='line_1944'>princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are</a>
<a id='line_1945'>great exercise authority upon them.</a>
<a id='line_1946'></a>
<a id='line_1947'>20:26 But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great</a>
<a id='line_1948'>among you, let him be your minister; 20:27 And whosoever will be chief</a>
<a id='line_1949'>among you, let him be your servant: 20:28 Even as the Son of man came</a>
<a id='line_1950'>not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a</a>
<a id='line_1951'>ransom for many.</a>
<a id='line_1952'></a>
<a id='line_1953'>20:29 And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed</a>
<a id='line_1954'>him.</a>
<a id='line_1955'></a>
<a id='line_1956'>20:30 And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they</a>
<a id='line_1957'>heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O</a>
<a id='line_1958'>Lord, thou son of David.</a>
<a id='line_1959'></a>
<a id='line_1960'>20:31 And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their</a>
<a id='line_1961'>peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou</a>
<a id='line_1962'>son of David.</a>
<a id='line_1963'></a>
<a id='line_1964'>20:32 And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye</a>
<a id='line_1965'>that I shall do unto you?  20:33 They say unto him, Lord, that our</a>
<a id='line_1966'>eyes may be opened.</a>
<a id='line_1967'></a>
<a id='line_1968'>20:34 So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and</a>
<a id='line_1969'>immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.</a>
<a id='line_1970'></a>
<a id='line_1971'>21:1 And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to</a>
<a id='line_1972'>Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two disciples,</a>
<a id='line_1973'>21:2 Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and</a>
<a id='line_1974'>straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her: loose</a>
<a id='line_1975'>them, and bring them unto me.</a>
<a id='line_1976'></a>
<a id='line_1977'>21:3 And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath</a>
<a id='line_1978'>need of them; and straightway he will send them.</a>
<a id='line_1979'></a>
<a id='line_1980'>21:4 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by</a>
<a id='line_1981'>the prophet, saying, 21:5 Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy</a>
<a id='line_1982'>King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the</a>
<a id='line_1983'>foal of an ass.</a>
<a id='line_1984'></a>
<a id='line_1985'>21:6 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them, 21:7 And</a>
<a id='line_1986'>brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they</a>
<a id='line_1987'>set him thereon.</a>
<a id='line_1988'></a>
<a id='line_1989'>21:8 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way;</a>
<a id='line_1990'>others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in the way.</a>
<a id='line_1991'></a>
<a id='line_1992'>21:9 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried,</a>
<a id='line_1993'>saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh in the</a>
<a id='line_1994'>name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.</a>
<a id='line_1995'></a>
<a id='line_1996'>21:10 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved,</a>
<a id='line_1997'>saying, Who is this?  21:11 And the multitude said, This is Jesus the</a>
<a id='line_1998'>prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.</a>
<a id='line_1999'></a>
<a id='line_2000'>21:12 And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them</a>
<a id='line_2001'>that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the</a>
<a id='line_2002'>moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves, 21:13 And said</a>
<a id='line_2003'>unto them, It is written, My house shall be called the house of</a>
<a id='line_2004'>prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.</a>
<a id='line_2005'></a>
<a id='line_2006'>21:14 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he</a>
<a id='line_2007'>healed them.</a>
<a id='line_2008'></a>
<a id='line_2009'>21:15 And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things</a>
<a id='line_2010'>that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying,</a>
<a id='line_2011'>Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore displeased, 21:16 And said</a>
<a id='line_2012'>unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea;</a>
<a id='line_2013'>have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast</a>
<a id='line_2014'>perfected praise?  21:17 And he left them, and went out of the city</a>
<a id='line_2015'>into Bethany; and he lodged there.</a>
<a id='line_2016'></a>
<a id='line_2017'>21:18 Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.</a>
<a id='line_2018'></a>
<a id='line_2019'>21:19 And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found</a>
<a id='line_2020'>nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let no fruit grow</a>
<a id='line_2021'>on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered</a>
<a id='line_2022'>away.</a>
<a id='line_2023'></a>
<a id='line_2024'>21:20 And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon</a>
<a id='line_2025'>is the fig tree withered away!  21:21 Jesus answered and said unto</a>
<a id='line_2026'>them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall</a>
<a id='line_2027'>not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall</a>
<a id='line_2028'>say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the</a>
<a id='line_2029'>sea; it shall be done.</a>
<a id='line_2030'></a>
<a id='line_2031'>21:22 And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye</a>
<a id='line_2032'>shall receive.</a>
<a id='line_2033'></a>
<a id='line_2034'>21:23 And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and the</a>
<a id='line_2035'>elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and said, By</a>
<a id='line_2036'>what authority doest thou these things? and who gave thee this</a>
<a id='line_2037'>authority?  21:24 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will</a>
<a id='line_2038'>ask you one thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you</a>
<a id='line_2039'>by what authority I do these things.</a>
<a id='line_2040'></a>
<a id='line_2041'>21:25 The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men? And</a>
<a id='line_2042'>they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven;</a>
<a id='line_2043'>he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe him?  21:26 But if we</a>
<a id='line_2044'>shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.</a>
<a id='line_2045'></a>
<a id='line_2046'>21:27 And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said</a>
<a id='line_2047'>unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things.</a>
<a id='line_2048'></a>
<a id='line_2049'>21:28 But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to</a>
<a id='line_2050'>the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.</a>
<a id='line_2051'></a>
<a id='line_2052'>21:29 He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and</a>
<a id='line_2053'>went.</a>
<a id='line_2054'></a>
<a id='line_2055'>21:30 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered</a>
<a id='line_2056'>and said, I go, sir: and went not.</a>
<a id='line_2057'></a>
<a id='line_2058'>21:31 Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto</a>
<a id='line_2059'>him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That the</a>
<a id='line_2060'>publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before you.</a>
<a id='line_2061'></a>
<a id='line_2062'>21:32 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye</a>
<a id='line_2063'>believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed him: and</a>
<a id='line_2064'>ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that ye might believe</a>
<a id='line_2065'>him.</a>
<a id='line_2066'></a>
<a id='line_2067'>21:33 Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which</a>
<a id='line_2068'>planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a winepress</a>
<a id='line_2069'>in it, and built a tower, and let it out to husbandmen, and went into</a>
<a id='line_2070'>a far country: 21:34 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent</a>
<a id='line_2071'>his servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of</a>
<a id='line_2072'>it.</a>
<a id='line_2073'></a>
<a id='line_2074'>21:35 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed</a>
<a id='line_2075'>another, and stoned another.</a>
<a id='line_2076'></a>
<a id='line_2077'>21:36 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they did</a>
<a id='line_2078'>unto them likewise.</a>
<a id='line_2079'></a>
<a id='line_2080'>21:37 But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will</a>
<a id='line_2081'>reverence my son.</a>
<a id='line_2082'></a>
<a id='line_2083'>21:38 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves,</a>
<a id='line_2084'>This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us seize on his</a>
<a id='line_2085'>inheritance.</a>
<a id='line_2086'></a>
<a id='line_2087'>21:39 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and slew</a>
<a id='line_2088'>him.</a>
<a id='line_2089'></a>
<a id='line_2090'>21:40 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he do</a>
<a id='line_2091'>unto those husbandmen?  21:41 They say unto him, He will miserably</a>
<a id='line_2092'>destroy those wicked men, and will let out his vineyard unto other</a>
<a id='line_2093'>husbandmen, which shall render him the fruits in their seasons.</a>
<a id='line_2094'></a>
<a id='line_2095'>21:42 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The</a>
<a id='line_2096'>stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the</a>
<a id='line_2097'>corner: this is the Lord’s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?</a>
<a id='line_2098'>21:43 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from</a>
<a id='line_2099'>you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.</a>
<a id='line_2100'></a>
<a id='line_2101'>21:44 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on</a>
<a id='line_2102'>whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</a>
<a id='line_2103'></a>
<a id='line_2104'>21:45 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables,</a>
<a id='line_2105'>they perceived that he spake of them.</a>
<a id='line_2106'></a>
<a id='line_2107'>21:46 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the</a>
<a id='line_2108'>multitude, because they took him for a prophet.</a>
<a id='line_2109'></a>
<a id='line_2110'>22:1 And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and</a>
<a id='line_2111'>said, 22:2 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which</a>
<a id='line_2112'>made a marriage for his son, 22:3 And sent forth his servants to call</a>
<a id='line_2113'>them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.</a>
<a id='line_2114'></a>
<a id='line_2115'>22:4 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are</a>
<a id='line_2116'>bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are</a>
<a id='line_2117'>killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.</a>
<a id='line_2118'></a>
<a id='line_2119'>22:5 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm,</a>
<a id='line_2120'>another to his merchandise: 22:6 And the remnant took his servants,</a>
<a id='line_2121'>and entreated them spitefully, and slew them.</a>
<a id='line_2122'></a>
<a id='line_2123'>22:7 But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth</a>
<a id='line_2124'>his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city.</a>
<a id='line_2125'></a>
<a id='line_2126'>22:8 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they</a>
<a id='line_2127'>which were bidden were not worthy.</a>
<a id='line_2128'></a>
<a id='line_2129'>22:9 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find,</a>
<a id='line_2130'>bid to the marriage.</a>
<a id='line_2131'></a>
<a id='line_2132'>22:10 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered</a>
<a id='line_2133'>together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding</a>
<a id='line_2134'>was furnished with guests.</a>
<a id='line_2135'></a>
<a id='line_2136'>22:11 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man</a>
<a id='line_2137'>which had not on a wedding garment: 22:12 And he saith unto him,</a>
<a id='line_2138'>Friend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he</a>
<a id='line_2139'>was speechless.</a>
<a id='line_2140'></a>
<a id='line_2141'>22:13 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot, and</a>
<a id='line_2142'>take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there shall be</a>
<a id='line_2143'>weeping and gnashing of teeth.</a>
<a id='line_2144'></a>
<a id='line_2145'>22:14 For many are called, but few are chosen.</a>
<a id='line_2146'></a>
<a id='line_2147'>22:15 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might</a>
<a id='line_2148'>entangle him in his talk.</a>
<a id='line_2149'></a>
<a id='line_2150'>22:16 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians,</a>
<a id='line_2151'>saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the way of</a>
<a id='line_2152'>God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not</a>
<a id='line_2153'>the person of men.</a>
<a id='line_2154'></a>
<a id='line_2155'>22:17 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give</a>
<a id='line_2156'>tribute unto Caesar, or not?  22:18 But Jesus perceived their</a>
<a id='line_2157'>wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?  22:19 Shew me</a>
<a id='line_2158'>the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.</a>
<a id='line_2159'></a>
<a id='line_2160'>22:20 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and superscription?</a>
<a id='line_2161'>22:21 They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render</a>
<a id='line_2162'>therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the</a>
<a id='line_2163'>things that are God’s.</a>
<a id='line_2164'></a>
<a id='line_2165'>22:22 When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him,</a>
<a id='line_2166'>and went their way.</a>
<a id='line_2167'></a>
<a id='line_2168'>22:23 The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is</a>
<a id='line_2169'>no resurrection, and asked him, 22:24 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a</a>
<a id='line_2170'>man die, having no children, his brother shall marry his wife, and</a>
<a id='line_2171'>raise up seed unto his brother.</a>
<a id='line_2172'></a>
<a id='line_2173'>22:25 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he</a>
<a id='line_2174'>had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his wife unto</a>
<a id='line_2175'>his brother: 22:26 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the</a>
<a id='line_2176'>seventh.</a>
<a id='line_2177'></a>
<a id='line_2178'>22:27 And last of all the woman died also.</a>
<a id='line_2179'></a>
<a id='line_2180'>22:28 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the</a>
<a id='line_2181'>seven?  for they all had her.</a>
<a id='line_2182'></a>
<a id='line_2183'>22:29 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the</a>
<a id='line_2184'>scriptures, nor the power of God.</a>
<a id='line_2185'></a>
<a id='line_2186'>22:30 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in</a>
<a id='line_2187'>marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_2188'></a>
<a id='line_2189'>22:31 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read</a>
<a id='line_2190'>that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, 22:32 I am the God of</a>
<a id='line_2191'>Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob?  God is not the</a>
<a id='line_2192'>God of the dead, but of the living.</a>
<a id='line_2193'></a>
<a id='line_2194'>22:33 And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his</a>
<a id='line_2195'>doctrine.</a>
<a id='line_2196'></a>
<a id='line_2197'>22:34 But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees</a>
<a id='line_2198'>to silence, they were gathered together.</a>
<a id='line_2199'></a>
<a id='line_2200'>22:35 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question,</a>
<a id='line_2201'>tempting him, and saying, 22:36 Master, which is the great commandment</a>
<a id='line_2202'>in the law?  22:37 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy</a>
<a id='line_2203'>God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.</a>
<a id='line_2204'></a>
<a id='line_2205'>22:38 This is the first and great commandment.</a>
<a id='line_2206'></a>
<a id='line_2207'>22:39 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as</a>
<a id='line_2208'>thyself.</a>
<a id='line_2209'></a>
<a id='line_2210'>22:40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.</a>
<a id='line_2211'></a>
<a id='line_2212'>22:41 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,</a>
<a id='line_2213'>22:42 Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto</a>
<a id='line_2214'>him, The son of David.</a>
<a id='line_2215'></a>
<a id='line_2216'>22:43 He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord,</a>
<a id='line_2217'>saying, 22:44 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</a>
<a id='line_2218'>till I make thine enemies thy footstool?  22:45 If David then call him</a>
<a id='line_2219'>Lord, how is he his son?  22:46 And no man was able to answer him a</a>
<a id='line_2220'>word, neither durst any man from that day forth ask him any more</a>
<a id='line_2221'>questions.</a>
<a id='line_2222'></a>
<a id='line_2223'>23:1 Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples, 23:2</a>
<a id='line_2224'>Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses’ seat: 23:3 All</a>
<a id='line_2225'>therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do</a>
<a id='line_2226'>not ye after their works: for they say, and do not.</a>
<a id='line_2227'></a>
<a id='line_2228'>23:4 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay</a>
<a id='line_2229'>them on men’s shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with</a>
<a id='line_2230'>one of their fingers.</a>
<a id='line_2231'></a>
<a id='line_2232'>23:5 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make</a>
<a id='line_2233'>broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,</a>
<a id='line_2234'>23:6 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in</a>
<a id='line_2235'>the synagogues, 23:7 And greetings in the markets, and to be called of</a>
<a id='line_2236'>men, Rabbi, Rabbi.</a>
<a id='line_2237'></a>
<a id='line_2238'>23:8 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ;</a>
<a id='line_2239'>and all ye are brethren.</a>
<a id='line_2240'></a>
<a id='line_2241'>23:9 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your</a>
<a id='line_2242'>Father, which is in heaven.</a>
<a id='line_2243'></a>
<a id='line_2244'>23:10 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even</a>
<a id='line_2245'>Christ.</a>
<a id='line_2246'></a>
<a id='line_2247'>23:11 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.</a>
<a id='line_2248'></a>
<a id='line_2249'>23:12 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that</a>
<a id='line_2250'>shall humble himself shall be exalted.</a>
<a id='line_2251'></a>
<a id='line_2252'>23:13 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye shut</a>
<a id='line_2253'>up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in yourselves,</a>
<a id='line_2254'>neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in.</a>
<a id='line_2255'></a>
<a id='line_2256'>23:14 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour</a>
<a id='line_2257'>widows’ houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore ye</a>
<a id='line_2258'>shall receive the greater damnation.</a>
<a id='line_2259'></a>
<a id='line_2260'>23:15 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye compass</a>
<a id='line_2261'>sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is made, ye make him</a>
<a id='line_2262'>twofold more the child of hell than yourselves.</a>
<a id='line_2263'></a>
<a id='line_2264'>23:16 Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall swear</a>
<a id='line_2265'>by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear by the gold of</a>
<a id='line_2266'>the temple, he is a debtor!  23:17 Ye fools and blind: for whether is</a>
<a id='line_2267'>greater, the gold, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold?  23:18</a>
<a id='line_2268'>And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but whosoever</a>
<a id='line_2269'>sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.</a>
<a id='line_2270'></a>
<a id='line_2271'>23:19 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the</a>
<a id='line_2272'>altar that sanctifieth the gift?  23:20 Whoso therefore shall swear by</a>
<a id='line_2273'>the altar, sweareth by it, and by all things thereon.</a>
<a id='line_2274'></a>
<a id='line_2275'>23:21 And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by him</a>
<a id='line_2276'>that dwelleth therein.</a>
<a id='line_2277'></a>
<a id='line_2278'>23:22 And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of</a>
<a id='line_2279'>God, and by him that sitteth thereon.</a>
<a id='line_2280'></a>
<a id='line_2281'>23:23 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay</a>
<a id='line_2282'>tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier</a>
<a id='line_2283'>matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have</a>
<a id='line_2284'>done, and not to leave the other undone.</a>
<a id='line_2285'></a>
<a id='line_2286'>23:24 Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.</a>
<a id='line_2287'></a>
<a id='line_2288'>23:25 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make</a>
<a id='line_2289'>clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are</a>
<a id='line_2290'>full of extortion and excess.</a>
<a id='line_2291'></a>
<a id='line_2292'>23:26 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the cup</a>
<a id='line_2293'>and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.</a>
<a id='line_2294'></a>
<a id='line_2295'>23:27 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like</a>
<a id='line_2296'>unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are</a>
<a id='line_2297'>within full of dead men’s bones, and of all uncleanness.</a>
<a id='line_2298'></a>
<a id='line_2299'>23:28 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but within</a>
<a id='line_2300'>ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.</a>
<a id='line_2301'></a>
<a id='line_2302'>23:29 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye</a>
<a id='line_2303'>build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the</a>
<a id='line_2304'>righteous, 23:30 And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers,</a>
<a id='line_2305'>we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the</a>
<a id='line_2306'>prophets.</a>
<a id='line_2307'></a>
<a id='line_2308'>23:31 Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the</a>
<a id='line_2309'>children of them which killed the prophets.</a>
<a id='line_2310'></a>
<a id='line_2311'>23:32 Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.</a>
<a id='line_2312'></a>
<a id='line_2313'>23:33 Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the</a>
<a id='line_2314'>damnation of hell?  23:34 Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets,</a>
<a id='line_2315'>and wise men, and scribes: and some of them ye shall kill and crucify;</a>
<a id='line_2316'>and some of them shall ye scourge in your synagogues, and persecute</a>
<a id='line_2317'>them from city to city: 23:35 That upon you may come all the righteous</a>
<a id='line_2318'>blood shed upon the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the</a>
<a id='line_2319'>blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple</a>
<a id='line_2320'>and the altar.</a>
<a id='line_2321'></a>
<a id='line_2322'>23:36 Verily I say unto you, All these things shall come upon this</a>
<a id='line_2323'>generation.</a>
<a id='line_2324'></a>
<a id='line_2325'>23:37 O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the prophets, and</a>
<a id='line_2326'>stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered</a>
<a id='line_2327'>thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her</a>
<a id='line_2328'>wings, and ye would not!  23:38 Behold, your house is left unto you</a>
<a id='line_2329'>desolate.</a>
<a id='line_2330'></a>
<a id='line_2331'>23:39 For I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye</a>
<a id='line_2332'>shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.</a>
<a id='line_2333'></a>
<a id='line_2334'>24:1 And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his</a>
<a id='line_2335'>disciples came to him for to shew him the buildings of the temple.</a>
<a id='line_2336'></a>
<a id='line_2337'>24:2 And Jesus said unto them, See ye not all these things? verily I</a>
<a id='line_2338'>say unto you, There shall not be left here one stone upon another,</a>
<a id='line_2339'>that shall not be thrown down.</a>
<a id='line_2340'></a>
<a id='line_2341'>24:3 And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came unto</a>
<a id='line_2342'>him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what</a>
<a id='line_2343'>shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?  24:4</a>
<a id='line_2344'>And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive</a>
<a id='line_2345'>you.</a>
<a id='line_2346'></a>
<a id='line_2347'>24:5 For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall</a>
<a id='line_2348'>deceive many.</a>
<a id='line_2349'></a>
<a id='line_2350'>24:6 And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not</a>
<a id='line_2351'>troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not</a>
<a id='line_2352'>yet.</a>
<a id='line_2353'></a>
<a id='line_2354'>24:7 For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against</a>
<a id='line_2355'>kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes,</a>
<a id='line_2356'>in divers places.</a>
<a id='line_2357'></a>
<a id='line_2358'>24:8 All these are the beginning of sorrows.</a>
<a id='line_2359'></a>
<a id='line_2360'>24:9 Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill</a>
<a id='line_2361'>you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name’s sake.</a>
<a id='line_2362'></a>
<a id='line_2363'>24:10 And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another,</a>
<a id='line_2364'>and shall hate one another.</a>
<a id='line_2365'></a>
<a id='line_2366'>24:11 And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.</a>
<a id='line_2367'></a>
<a id='line_2368'>24:12 And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax</a>
<a id='line_2369'>cold.</a>
<a id='line_2370'></a>
<a id='line_2371'>24:13 But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.</a>
<a id='line_2372'></a>
<a id='line_2373'>24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the</a>
<a id='line_2374'>world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.</a>
<a id='line_2375'></a>
<a id='line_2376'>24:15 When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation,</a>
<a id='line_2377'>spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso</a>
<a id='line_2378'>readeth, let him understand:) 24:16 Then let them which be in Judaea</a>
<a id='line_2379'>flee into the mountains: 24:17 Let him which is on the housetop not</a>
<a id='line_2380'>come down to take any thing out of his house: 24:18 Neither let him</a>
<a id='line_2381'>which is in the field return back to take his clothes.</a>
<a id='line_2382'></a>
<a id='line_2383'>24:19 And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give</a>
<a id='line_2384'>suck in those days!  24:20 But pray ye that your flight be not in the</a>
<a id='line_2385'>winter, neither on the sabbath day: 24:21 For then shall be great</a>
<a id='line_2386'>tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this</a>
<a id='line_2387'>time, no, nor ever shall be.</a>
<a id='line_2388'></a>
<a id='line_2389'>24:22 And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh</a>
<a id='line_2390'>be saved: but for the elect’s sake those days shall be shortened.</a>
<a id='line_2391'></a>
<a id='line_2392'>24:23 Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or</a>
<a id='line_2393'>there; believe it not.</a>
<a id='line_2394'></a>
<a id='line_2395'>24:24 For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and</a>
<a id='line_2396'>shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were</a>
<a id='line_2397'>possible, they shall deceive the very elect.</a>
<a id='line_2398'></a>
<a id='line_2399'>24:25 Behold, I have told you before.</a>
<a id='line_2400'></a>
<a id='line_2401'>24:26 Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the</a>
<a id='line_2402'>desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it</a>
<a id='line_2403'>not.</a>
<a id='line_2404'></a>
<a id='line_2405'>24:27 For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even</a>
<a id='line_2406'>unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</a>
<a id='line_2407'></a>
<a id='line_2408'>24:28 For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be</a>
<a id='line_2409'>gathered together.</a>
<a id='line_2410'></a>
<a id='line_2411'>24:29 Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be</a>
<a id='line_2412'>darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall</a>
<a id='line_2413'>fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken: 24:30</a>
<a id='line_2414'>And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then</a>
<a id='line_2415'>shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of</a>
<a id='line_2416'>man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</a>
<a id='line_2417'></a>
<a id='line_2418'>24:31 And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet,</a>
<a id='line_2419'>and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one</a>
<a id='line_2420'>end of heaven to the other.</a>
<a id='line_2421'></a>
<a id='line_2422'>24:32 Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet</a>
<a id='line_2423'>tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh: 24:33</a>
<a id='line_2424'>So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is</a>
<a id='line_2425'>near, even at the doors.</a>
<a id='line_2426'></a>
<a id='line_2427'>24:34 Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all</a>
<a id='line_2428'>these things be fulfilled.</a>
<a id='line_2429'></a>
<a id='line_2430'>24:35 Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass</a>
<a id='line_2431'>away.</a>
<a id='line_2432'></a>
<a id='line_2433'>24:36 But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of</a>
<a id='line_2434'>heaven, but my Father only.</a>
<a id='line_2435'></a>
<a id='line_2436'>24:37 But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son</a>
<a id='line_2437'>of man be.</a>
<a id='line_2438'></a>
<a id='line_2439'>24:38 For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating</a>
<a id='line_2440'>and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noe</a>
<a id='line_2441'>entered into the ark, 24:39 And knew not until the flood came, and</a>
<a id='line_2442'>took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.</a>
<a id='line_2443'></a>
<a id='line_2444'>24:40 Then shall two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the</a>
<a id='line_2445'>other left.</a>
<a id='line_2446'></a>
<a id='line_2447'>24:41 Two women shall be grinding at the mill; the one shall be taken,</a>
<a id='line_2448'>and the other left.</a>
<a id='line_2449'></a>
<a id='line_2450'>24:42 Watch therefore: for ye know not what hour your Lord doth come.</a>
<a id='line_2451'></a>
<a id='line_2452'>24:43 But know this, that if the goodman of the house had known in</a>
<a id='line_2453'>what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not</a>
<a id='line_2454'>have suffered his house to be broken up.</a>
<a id='line_2455'></a>
<a id='line_2456'>24:44 Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye think not</a>
<a id='line_2457'>the Son of man cometh.</a>
<a id='line_2458'></a>
<a id='line_2459'>24:45 Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord hath made</a>
<a id='line_2460'>ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?  24:46</a>
<a id='line_2461'>Blessed is that servant, whom his lord when he cometh shall find so</a>
<a id='line_2462'>doing.</a>
<a id='line_2463'></a>
<a id='line_2464'>24:47 Verily I say unto you, That he shall make him ruler over all his</a>
<a id='line_2465'>goods.</a>
<a id='line_2466'></a>
<a id='line_2467'>24:48 But and if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My lord</a>
<a id='line_2468'>delayeth his coming; 24:49 And shall begin to smite his</a>
<a id='line_2469'>fellowservants, and to eat and drink with the drunken; 24:50 The lord</a>
<a id='line_2470'>of that servant shall come in a day when he looketh not for him, and</a>
<a id='line_2471'>in an hour that he is not aware of, 24:51 And shall cut him asunder,</a>
<a id='line_2472'>and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be</a>
<a id='line_2473'>weeping and gnashing of teeth.</a>
<a id='line_2474'></a>
<a id='line_2475'>25:1 Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins,</a>
<a id='line_2476'>which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.</a>
<a id='line_2477'></a>
<a id='line_2478'>25:2 And five of them were wise, and five were foolish.</a>
<a id='line_2479'></a>
<a id='line_2480'>25:3 They that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with</a>
<a id='line_2481'>them: 25:4 But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.</a>
<a id='line_2482'></a>
<a id='line_2483'>25:5 While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.</a>
<a id='line_2484'></a>
<a id='line_2485'>25:6 And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom</a>
<a id='line_2486'>cometh; go ye out to meet him.</a>
<a id='line_2487'></a>
<a id='line_2488'>25:7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.</a>
<a id='line_2489'></a>
<a id='line_2490'>25:8 And the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our</a>
<a id='line_2491'>lamps are gone out.</a>
<a id='line_2492'></a>
<a id='line_2493'>25:9 But the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough</a>
<a id='line_2494'>for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for</a>
<a id='line_2495'>yourselves.</a>
<a id='line_2496'></a>
<a id='line_2497'>25:10 And while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that</a>
<a id='line_2498'>were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.</a>
<a id='line_2499'></a>
<a id='line_2500'>25:11 Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open</a>
<a id='line_2501'>to us.</a>
<a id='line_2502'></a>
<a id='line_2503'>25:12 But he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, I know you not.</a>
<a id='line_2504'></a>
<a id='line_2505'>25:13 Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour</a>
<a id='line_2506'>wherein the Son of man cometh.</a>
<a id='line_2507'></a>
<a id='line_2508'>25:14 For the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far</a>
<a id='line_2509'>country, who called his own servants, and delivered unto them his</a>
<a id='line_2510'>goods.</a>
<a id='line_2511'></a>
<a id='line_2512'>25:15 And unto one he gave five talents, to another two, and to</a>
<a id='line_2513'>another one; to every man according to his several ability; and</a>
<a id='line_2514'>straightway took his journey.</a>
<a id='line_2515'></a>
<a id='line_2516'>25:16 Then he that had received the five talents went and traded with</a>
<a id='line_2517'>the same, and made them other five talents.</a>
<a id='line_2518'></a>
<a id='line_2519'>25:17 And likewise he that had received two, he also gained other two.</a>
<a id='line_2520'></a>
<a id='line_2521'>25:18 But he that had received one went and digged in the earth, and</a>
<a id='line_2522'>hid his lord’s money.</a>
<a id='line_2523'></a>
<a id='line_2524'>25:19 After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and</a>
<a id='line_2525'>reckoneth with them.</a>
<a id='line_2526'></a>
<a id='line_2527'>25:20 And so he that had received five talents came and brought other</a>
<a id='line_2528'>five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst unto me five talents:</a>
<a id='line_2529'>behold, I have gained beside them five talents more.</a>
<a id='line_2530'></a>
<a id='line_2531'>25:21 His lord said unto him, Well done, thou good and faithful</a>
<a id='line_2532'>servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee</a>
<a id='line_2533'>ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</a>
<a id='line_2534'></a>
<a id='line_2535'>25:22 He also that had received two talents came and said, Lord, thou</a>
<a id='line_2536'>deliveredst unto me two talents: behold, I have gained two other</a>
<a id='line_2537'>talents beside them.</a>
<a id='line_2538'></a>
<a id='line_2539'>25:23 His lord said unto him, Well done, good and faithful servant;</a>
<a id='line_2540'>thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over</a>
<a id='line_2541'>many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</a>
<a id='line_2542'></a>
<a id='line_2543'>25:24 Then he which had received the one talent came and said, Lord, I</a>
<a id='line_2544'>knew thee that thou art an hard man, reaping where thou hast not sown,</a>
<a id='line_2545'>and gathering where thou hast not strawed: 25:25 And I was afraid, and</a>
<a id='line_2546'>went and hid thy talent in the earth: lo, there thou hast that is</a>
<a id='line_2547'>thine.</a>
<a id='line_2548'></a>
<a id='line_2549'>25:26 His lord answered and said unto him, Thou wicked and slothful</a>
<a id='line_2550'>servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not, and gather where</a>
<a id='line_2551'>I have not strawed: 25:27 Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money</a>
<a id='line_2552'>to the exchangers, and then at my coming I should have received mine</a>
<a id='line_2553'>own with usury.</a>
<a id='line_2554'></a>
<a id='line_2555'>25:28 Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which</a>
<a id='line_2556'>hath ten talents.</a>
<a id='line_2557'></a>
<a id='line_2558'>25:29 For unto every one that hath shall be given, and he shall have</a>
<a id='line_2559'>abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away even that</a>
<a id='line_2560'>which he hath.</a>
<a id='line_2561'></a>
<a id='line_2562'>25:30 And cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness: there</a>
<a id='line_2563'>shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</a>
<a id='line_2564'></a>
<a id='line_2565'>25:31 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy</a>
<a id='line_2566'>angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: 25:32</a>
<a id='line_2567'>And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate</a>
<a id='line_2568'>them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the</a>
<a id='line_2569'>goats: 25:33 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the</a>
<a id='line_2570'>goats on the left.</a>
<a id='line_2571'></a>
<a id='line_2572'>25:34 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye</a>
<a id='line_2573'>blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the</a>
<a id='line_2574'>foundation of the world: 25:35 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me</a>
<a id='line_2575'>meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye</a>
<a id='line_2576'>took me in: 25:36 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited</a>
<a id='line_2577'>me: I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</a>
<a id='line_2578'></a>
<a id='line_2579'>25:37 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we</a>
<a id='line_2580'>thee an hungred, and fed thee? or thirsty, and gave thee drink?  25:38</a>
<a id='line_2581'>When saw we thee a stranger, and took thee in? or naked, and clothed</a>
<a id='line_2582'>thee?  25:39 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto</a>
<a id='line_2583'>thee?  25:40 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say</a>
<a id='line_2584'>unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these</a>
<a id='line_2585'>my brethren, ye have done it unto me.</a>
<a id='line_2586'></a>
<a id='line_2587'>25:41 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from</a>
<a id='line_2588'>me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his</a>
<a id='line_2589'>angels: 25:42 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was</a>
<a id='line_2590'>thirsty, and ye gave me no drink: 25:43 I was a stranger, and ye took</a>
<a id='line_2591'>me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye</a>
<a id='line_2592'>visited me not.</a>
<a id='line_2593'></a>
<a id='line_2594'>25:44 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee</a>
<a id='line_2595'>an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in</a>
<a id='line_2596'>prison, and did not minister unto thee?  25:45 Then shall he answer</a>
<a id='line_2597'>them, saying, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one</a>
<a id='line_2598'>of the least of these, ye did it not to me.</a>
<a id='line_2599'></a>
<a id='line_2600'>25:46 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the</a>
<a id='line_2601'>righteous into life eternal.</a>
<a id='line_2602'></a>
<a id='line_2603'>26:1 And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these sayings,</a>
<a id='line_2604'>he said unto his disciples, 26:2 Ye know that after two days is the</a>
<a id='line_2605'>feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</a>
<a id='line_2606'></a>
<a id='line_2607'>26:3 Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and</a>
<a id='line_2608'>the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was</a>
<a id='line_2609'>called Caiaphas, 26:4 And consulted that they might take Jesus by</a>
<a id='line_2610'>subtilty, and kill him.</a>
<a id='line_2611'></a>
<a id='line_2612'>26:5 But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar</a>
<a id='line_2613'>among the people.</a>
<a id='line_2614'></a>
<a id='line_2615'>26:6 Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,</a>
<a id='line_2616'>26:7 There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very</a>
<a id='line_2617'>precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat.</a>
<a id='line_2618'></a>
<a id='line_2619'>26:8 But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To</a>
<a id='line_2620'>what purpose is this waste?  26:9 For this ointment might have been</a>
<a id='line_2621'>sold for much, and given to the poor.</a>
<a id='line_2622'></a>
<a id='line_2623'>26:10 When Jesus understood it, he said unto them, Why trouble ye the</a>
<a id='line_2624'>woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</a>
<a id='line_2625'></a>
<a id='line_2626'>26:11 For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</a>
<a id='line_2627'></a>
<a id='line_2628'>26:12 For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it</a>
<a id='line_2629'>for my burial.</a>
<a id='line_2630'></a>
<a id='line_2631'>26:13 Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached</a>
<a id='line_2632'>in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done,</a>
<a id='line_2633'>be told for a memorial of her.</a>
<a id='line_2634'></a>
<a id='line_2635'>26:14 Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went unto the</a>
<a id='line_2636'>chief priests, 26:15 And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I</a>
<a id='line_2637'>will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty</a>
<a id='line_2638'>pieces of silver.</a>
<a id='line_2639'></a>
<a id='line_2640'>26:16 And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</a>
<a id='line_2641'></a>
<a id='line_2642'>26:17 Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples</a>
<a id='line_2643'>came to Jesus, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for</a>
<a id='line_2644'>thee to eat the passover?  26:18 And he said, Go into the city to such</a>
<a id='line_2645'>a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will</a>
<a id='line_2646'>keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</a>
<a id='line_2647'></a>
<a id='line_2648'>26:19 And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and they made</a>
<a id='line_2649'>ready the passover.</a>
<a id='line_2650'></a>
<a id='line_2651'>26:20 Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve.</a>
<a id='line_2652'></a>
<a id='line_2653'>26:21 And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of</a>
<a id='line_2654'>you shall betray me.</a>
<a id='line_2655'></a>
<a id='line_2656'>26:22 And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them</a>
<a id='line_2657'>to say unto him, Lord, is it I?  26:23 And he answered and said, He</a>
<a id='line_2658'>that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</a>
<a id='line_2659'></a>
<a id='line_2660'>26:24 The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that</a>
<a id='line_2661'>man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man</a>
<a id='line_2662'>if he had not been born.</a>
<a id='line_2663'></a>
<a id='line_2664'>26:25 Then Judas, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it</a>
<a id='line_2665'>I?  He said unto him, Thou hast said.</a>
<a id='line_2666'></a>
<a id='line_2667'>26:26 And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and</a>
<a id='line_2668'>brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is</a>
<a id='line_2669'>my body.</a>
<a id='line_2670'></a>
<a id='line_2671'>26:27 And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them,</a>
<a id='line_2672'>saying, Drink ye all of it; 26:28 For this is my blood of the new</a>
<a id='line_2673'>testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</a>
<a id='line_2674'></a>
<a id='line_2675'>26:29 But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of</a>
<a id='line_2676'>the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s</a>
<a id='line_2677'>kingdom.</a>
<a id='line_2678'></a>
<a id='line_2679'>26:30 And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of</a>
<a id='line_2680'>Olives.</a>
<a id='line_2681'></a>
<a id='line_2682'>26:31 Then saith Jesus unto them, All ye shall be offended because of</a>
<a id='line_2683'>me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the</a>
<a id='line_2684'>sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</a>
<a id='line_2685'></a>
<a id='line_2686'>26:32 But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</a>
<a id='line_2687'></a>
<a id='line_2688'>26:33 Peter answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be</a>
<a id='line_2689'>offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended.</a>
<a id='line_2690'></a>
<a id='line_2691'>26:34 Jesus said unto him, Verily I say unto thee, That this night,</a>
<a id='line_2692'>before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</a>
<a id='line_2693'></a>
<a id='line_2694'>26:35 Peter said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I</a>
<a id='line_2695'>not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples.</a>
<a id='line_2696'></a>
<a id='line_2697'>26:36 Then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane, and</a>
<a id='line_2698'>saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder.</a>
<a id='line_2699'></a>
<a id='line_2700'>26:37 And he took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and</a>
<a id='line_2701'>began to be sorrowful and very heavy.</a>
<a id='line_2702'></a>
<a id='line_2703'>26:38 Then saith he unto them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even</a>
<a id='line_2704'>unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</a>
<a id='line_2705'></a>
<a id='line_2706'>26:39 And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed,</a>
<a id='line_2707'>saying, O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:</a>
<a id='line_2708'>nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</a>
<a id='line_2709'></a>
<a id='line_2710'>26:40 And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and</a>
<a id='line_2711'>saith unto Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?  26:41</a>
<a id='line_2712'>Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed</a>
<a id='line_2713'>is willing, but the flesh is weak.</a>
<a id='line_2714'></a>
<a id='line_2715'>26:42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my</a>
<a id='line_2716'>Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy</a>
<a id='line_2717'>will be done.</a>
<a id='line_2718'></a>
<a id='line_2719'>26:43 And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were</a>
<a id='line_2720'>heavy.</a>
<a id='line_2721'></a>
<a id='line_2722'>26:44 And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third</a>
<a id='line_2723'>time, saying the same words.</a>
<a id='line_2724'></a>
<a id='line_2725'>26:45 Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on</a>
<a id='line_2726'>now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of</a>
<a id='line_2727'>man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</a>
<a id='line_2728'></a>
<a id='line_2729'>26:46 Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray</a>
<a id='line_2730'>me.</a>
<a id='line_2731'></a>
<a id='line_2732'>26:47 And while he yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve, came, and</a>
<a id='line_2733'>with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief</a>
<a id='line_2734'>priests and elders of the people.</a>
<a id='line_2735'></a>
<a id='line_2736'>26:48 Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I</a>
<a id='line_2737'>shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast.</a>
<a id='line_2738'></a>
<a id='line_2739'>26:49 And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail, master; and</a>
<a id='line_2740'>kissed him.</a>
<a id='line_2741'></a>
<a id='line_2742'>26:50 And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? Then</a>
<a id='line_2743'>came they, and laid hands on Jesus and took him.</a>
<a id='line_2744'></a>
<a id='line_2745'>26:51 And, behold, one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his</a>
<a id='line_2746'>hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest’s,</a>
<a id='line_2747'>and smote off his ear.</a>
<a id='line_2748'></a>
<a id='line_2749'>26:52 Then said Jesus unto him, Put up again thy sword into his place:</a>
<a id='line_2750'>for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</a>
<a id='line_2751'></a>
<a id='line_2752'>26:53 Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall</a>
<a id='line_2753'>presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?  26:54 But how</a>
<a id='line_2754'>then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?  26:55</a>
<a id='line_2755'>In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye come out as</a>
<a id='line_2756'>against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily</a>
<a id='line_2757'>with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</a>
<a id='line_2758'></a>
<a id='line_2759'>26:56 But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might</a>
<a id='line_2760'>be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled.</a>
<a id='line_2761'></a>
<a id='line_2762'>26:57 And they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to Caiaphas</a>
<a id='line_2763'>the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled.</a>
<a id='line_2764'></a>
<a id='line_2765'>26:58 But Peter followed him afar off unto the high priest’s palace,</a>
<a id='line_2766'>and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end.</a>
<a id='line_2767'></a>
<a id='line_2768'>26:59 Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought</a>
<a id='line_2769'>false witness against Jesus, to put him to death; 26:60 But found</a>
<a id='line_2770'>none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At</a>
<a id='line_2771'>the last came two false witnesses, 26:61 And said, This fellow said, I</a>
<a id='line_2772'>am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.</a>
<a id='line_2773'></a>
<a id='line_2774'>26:62 And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou</a>
<a id='line_2775'>nothing? what is it which these witness against thee?  26:63 But Jesus</a>
<a id='line_2776'>held his peace, And the high priest answered and said unto him, I</a>
<a id='line_2777'>adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the</a>
<a id='line_2778'>Christ, the Son of God.</a>
<a id='line_2779'></a>
<a id='line_2780'>26:64 Jesus saith unto him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto</a>
<a id='line_2781'>you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand</a>
<a id='line_2782'>of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</a>
<a id='line_2783'></a>
<a id='line_2784'>26:65 Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken</a>
<a id='line_2785'>blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have</a>
<a id='line_2786'>heard his blasphemy.</a>
<a id='line_2787'></a>
<a id='line_2788'>26:66 What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death.</a>
<a id='line_2789'></a>
<a id='line_2790'>26:67 Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others</a>
<a id='line_2791'>smote him with the palms of their hands, 26:68 Saying, Prophesy unto</a>
<a id='line_2792'>us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote thee?  26:69 Now Peter sat</a>
<a id='line_2793'>without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also</a>
<a id='line_2794'>wast with Jesus of Galilee.</a>
<a id='line_2795'></a>
<a id='line_2796'>26:70 But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou</a>
<a id='line_2797'>sayest.</a>
<a id='line_2798'></a>
<a id='line_2799'>26:71 And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him,</a>
<a id='line_2800'>and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with Jesus of</a>
<a id='line_2801'>Nazareth.</a>
<a id='line_2802'></a>
<a id='line_2803'>26:72 And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.</a>
<a id='line_2804'></a>
<a id='line_2805'>26:73 And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to</a>
<a id='line_2806'>Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth</a>
<a id='line_2807'>thee.</a>
<a id='line_2808'></a>
<a id='line_2809'>26:74 Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man.</a>
<a id='line_2810'>And immediately the cock crew.</a>
<a id='line_2811'></a>
<a id='line_2812'>26:75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, which said unto him,</a>
<a id='line_2813'>Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. And he went out, and</a>
<a id='line_2814'>wept bitterly.</a>
<a id='line_2815'></a>
<a id='line_2816'>27:1 When the morning was come, all the chief priests and elders of</a>
<a id='line_2817'>the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death: 27:2 And</a>
<a id='line_2818'>when they had bound him, they led him away, and delivered him to</a>
<a id='line_2819'>Pontius Pilate the governor.</a>
<a id='line_2820'></a>
<a id='line_2821'>27:3 Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was</a>
<a id='line_2822'>condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of</a>
<a id='line_2823'>silver to the chief priests and elders, 27:4 Saying, I have sinned in</a>
<a id='line_2824'>that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they said, What is that</a>
<a id='line_2825'>to us? see thou to that.</a>
<a id='line_2826'></a>
<a id='line_2827'>27:5 And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and</a>
<a id='line_2828'>departed, and went and hanged himself.</a>
<a id='line_2829'></a>
<a id='line_2830'>27:6 And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It is not</a>
<a id='line_2831'>lawful for to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of</a>
<a id='line_2832'>blood.</a>
<a id='line_2833'></a>
<a id='line_2834'>27:7 And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter’s field,</a>
<a id='line_2835'>to bury strangers in.</a>
<a id='line_2836'></a>
<a id='line_2837'>27:8 Wherefore that field was called, The field of blood, unto this</a>
<a id='line_2838'>day.</a>
<a id='line_2839'></a>
<a id='line_2840'>27:9 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet,</a>
<a id='line_2841'>saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him</a>
<a id='line_2842'>that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value; 27:10</a>
<a id='line_2843'>And gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord appointed me.</a>
<a id='line_2844'></a>
<a id='line_2845'>27:11 And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor asked him,</a>
<a id='line_2846'>saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus said unto him, Thou</a>
<a id='line_2847'>sayest.</a>
<a id='line_2848'></a>
<a id='line_2849'>27:12 And when he was accused of the chief priests and elders, he</a>
<a id='line_2850'>answered nothing.</a>
<a id='line_2851'></a>
<a id='line_2852'>27:13 Then said Pilate unto him, Hearest thou not how many things they</a>
<a id='line_2853'>witness against thee?  27:14 And he answered him to never a word;</a>
<a id='line_2854'>insomuch that the governor marvelled greatly.</a>
<a id='line_2855'></a>
<a id='line_2856'>27:15 Now at that feast the governor was wont to release unto the</a>
<a id='line_2857'>people a prisoner, whom they would.</a>
<a id='line_2858'></a>
<a id='line_2859'>27:16 And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.</a>
<a id='line_2860'></a>
<a id='line_2861'>27:17 Therefore when they were gathered together, Pilate said unto</a>
<a id='line_2862'>them, Whom will ye that I release unto you? Barabbas, or Jesus which</a>
<a id='line_2863'>is called Christ?  27:18 For he knew that for envy they had delivered</a>
<a id='line_2864'>him.</a>
<a id='line_2865'></a>
<a id='line_2866'>27:19 When he was set down on the judgment seat, his wife sent unto</a>
<a id='line_2867'>him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I have</a>
<a id='line_2868'>suffered many things this day in a dream because of him.</a>
<a id='line_2869'></a>
<a id='line_2870'>27:20 But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that</a>
<a id='line_2871'>they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.</a>
<a id='line_2872'></a>
<a id='line_2873'>27:21 The governor answered and said unto them, Whether of the twain</a>
<a id='line_2874'>will ye that I release unto you? They said, Barabbas.</a>
<a id='line_2875'></a>
<a id='line_2876'>27:22 Pilate saith unto them, What shall I do then with Jesus which is</a>
<a id='line_2877'>called Christ? They all say unto him, Let him be crucified.</a>
<a id='line_2878'></a>
<a id='line_2879'>27:23 And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But they</a>
<a id='line_2880'>cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.</a>
<a id='line_2881'></a>
<a id='line_2882'>27:24 When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a</a>
<a id='line_2883'>tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the</a>
<a id='line_2884'>multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood of this just person: see</a>
<a id='line_2885'>ye to it.</a>
<a id='line_2886'></a>
<a id='line_2887'>27:25 Then answered all the people, and said, His blood be on us, and</a>
<a id='line_2888'>on our children.</a>
<a id='line_2889'></a>
<a id='line_2890'>27:26 Then released he Barabbas unto them: and when he had scourged</a>
<a id='line_2891'>Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</a>
<a id='line_2892'></a>
<a id='line_2893'>27:27 Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common</a>
<a id='line_2894'>hall, and gathered unto him the whole band of soldiers.</a>
<a id='line_2895'></a>
<a id='line_2896'>27:28 And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.</a>
<a id='line_2897'></a>
<a id='line_2898'>27:29 And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put it upon</a>
<a id='line_2899'>his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before</a>
<a id='line_2900'>him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!  27:30 And they</a>
<a id='line_2901'>spit upon him, and took the reed, and smote him on the head.</a>
<a id='line_2902'></a>
<a id='line_2903'>27:31 And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off from</a>
<a id='line_2904'>him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to crucify him.</a>
<a id='line_2905'></a>
<a id='line_2906'>27:32 And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name:</a>
<a id='line_2907'>him they compelled to bear his cross.</a>
<a id='line_2908'></a>
<a id='line_2909'>27:33 And when they were come unto a place called Golgotha, that is to</a>
<a id='line_2910'>say, a place of a skull, 27:34 They gave him vinegar to drink mingled</a>
<a id='line_2911'>with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.</a>
<a id='line_2912'></a>
<a id='line_2913'>27:35 And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting lots:</a>
<a id='line_2914'>that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, They</a>
<a id='line_2915'>parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</a>
<a id='line_2916'></a>
<a id='line_2917'>27:36 And sitting down they watched him there; 27:37 And set up over</a>
<a id='line_2918'>his head his accusation written, THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</a>
<a id='line_2919'></a>
<a id='line_2920'>27:38 Then were there two thieves crucified with him, one on the right</a>
<a id='line_2921'>hand, and another on the left.</a>
<a id='line_2922'></a>
<a id='line_2923'>27:39 And they that passed by reviled him, wagging their heads, 27:40</a>
<a id='line_2924'>And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three</a>
<a id='line_2925'>days, save thyself. If thou be the Son of God, come down from the</a>
<a id='line_2926'>cross.</a>
<a id='line_2927'></a>
<a id='line_2928'>27:41 Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes</a>
<a id='line_2929'>and elders, said, 27:42 He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he</a>
<a id='line_2930'>be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we</a>
<a id='line_2931'>will believe him.</a>
<a id='line_2932'></a>
<a id='line_2933'>27:43 He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will have him:</a>
<a id='line_2934'>for he said, I am the Son of God.</a>
<a id='line_2935'></a>
<a id='line_2936'>27:44 The thieves also, which were crucified with him, cast the same</a>
<a id='line_2937'>in his teeth.</a>
<a id='line_2938'></a>
<a id='line_2939'>27:45 Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land</a>
<a id='line_2940'>unto the ninth hour.</a>
<a id='line_2941'></a>
<a id='line_2942'>27:46 And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,</a>
<a id='line_2943'>Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why hast</a>
<a id='line_2944'>thou forsaken me?  27:47 Some of them that stood there, when they</a>
<a id='line_2945'>heard that, said, This man calleth for Elias.</a>
<a id='line_2946'></a>
<a id='line_2947'>27:48 And straightway one of them ran, and took a spunge, and filled</a>
<a id='line_2948'>it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink.</a>
<a id='line_2949'></a>
<a id='line_2950'>27:49 The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to</a>
<a id='line_2951'>save him.</a>
<a id='line_2952'></a>
<a id='line_2953'>27:50 Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the</a>
<a id='line_2954'>ghost.</a>
<a id='line_2955'></a>
<a id='line_2956'>27:51 And, behold, the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the</a>
<a id='line_2957'>top to the bottom; and the earth did quake, and the rocks rent; 27:52</a>
<a id='line_2958'>And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept</a>
<a id='line_2959'>arose, 27:53 And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and</a>
<a id='line_2960'>went into the holy city, and appeared unto many.</a>
<a id='line_2961'></a>
<a id='line_2962'>27:54 Now when the centurion, and they that were with him, watching</a>
<a id='line_2963'>Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were done, they</a>
<a id='line_2964'>feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God.</a>
<a id='line_2965'></a>
<a id='line_2966'>27:55 And many women were there beholding afar off, which followed</a>
<a id='line_2967'>Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him: 27:56 Among which was Mary</a>
<a id='line_2968'>Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of</a>
<a id='line_2969'>Zebedees children.</a>
<a id='line_2970'></a>
<a id='line_2971'>27:57 When the even was come, there came a rich man of Arimathaea,</a>
<a id='line_2972'>named Joseph, who also himself was Jesus’ disciple: 27:58 He went to</a>
<a id='line_2973'>Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body</a>
<a id='line_2974'>to be delivered.</a>
<a id='line_2975'></a>
<a id='line_2976'>27:59 And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a clean</a>
<a id='line_2977'>linen cloth, 27:60 And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn</a>
<a id='line_2978'>out in the rock: and he rolled a great stone to the door of the</a>
<a id='line_2979'>sepulchre, and departed.</a>
<a id='line_2980'></a>
<a id='line_2981'>27:61 And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting over</a>
<a id='line_2982'>against the sepulchre.</a>
<a id='line_2983'></a>
<a id='line_2984'>27:62 Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the</a>
<a id='line_2985'>chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, 27:63 Saying,</a>
<a id='line_2986'>Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive,</a>
<a id='line_2987'>After three days I will rise again.</a>
<a id='line_2988'></a>
<a id='line_2989'>27:64 Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the</a>
<a id='line_2990'>third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him away, and</a>
<a id='line_2991'>say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error</a>
<a id='line_2992'>shall be worse than the first.</a>
<a id='line_2993'></a>
<a id='line_2994'>27:65 Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as</a>
<a id='line_2995'>sure as ye can.</a>
<a id='line_2996'></a>
<a id='line_2997'>27:66 So they went, and made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone,</a>
<a id='line_2998'>and setting a watch.</a>
<a id='line_2999'></a>
<a id='line_3000'>28:1 In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first</a>
<a id='line_3001'>day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the</a>
<a id='line_3002'>sepulchre.</a>
<a id='line_3003'></a>
<a id='line_3004'>28:2 And, behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of the</a>
<a id='line_3005'>Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from</a>
<a id='line_3006'>the door, and sat upon it.</a>
<a id='line_3007'></a>
<a id='line_3008'>28:3 His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white as</a>
<a id='line_3009'>snow: 28:4 And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as</a>
<a id='line_3010'>dead men.</a>
<a id='line_3011'></a>
<a id='line_3012'>28:5 And the angel answered and said unto the women, Fear not ye: for</a>
<a id='line_3013'>I know that ye seek Jesus, which was crucified.</a>
<a id='line_3014'></a>
<a id='line_3015'>28:6 He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the place</a>
<a id='line_3016'>where the Lord lay.</a>
<a id='line_3017'></a>
<a id='line_3018'>28:7 And go quickly, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the</a>
<a id='line_3019'>dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galilee; there shall ye</a>
<a id='line_3020'>see him: lo, I have told you.</a>
<a id='line_3021'></a>
<a id='line_3022'>28:8 And they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great</a>
<a id='line_3023'>joy; and did run to bring his disciples word.</a>
<a id='line_3024'></a>
<a id='line_3025'>28:9 And as they went to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus met them,</a>
<a id='line_3026'>saying, All hail. And they came and held him by the feet, and</a>
<a id='line_3027'>worshipped him.</a>
<a id='line_3028'></a>
<a id='line_3029'>28:10 Then said Jesus unto them, Be not afraid: go tell my brethren</a>
<a id='line_3030'>that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see me.</a>
<a id='line_3031'></a>
<a id='line_3032'>28:11 Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into</a>
<a id='line_3033'>the city, and shewed unto the chief priests all the things that were</a>
<a id='line_3034'>done.</a>
<a id='line_3035'></a>
<a id='line_3036'>28:12 And when they were assembled with the elders, and had taken</a>
<a id='line_3037'>counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, 28:13 Saying, Say</a>
<a id='line_3038'>ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him away while we slept.</a>
<a id='line_3039'></a>
<a id='line_3040'>28:14 And if this come to the governor’s ears, we will persuade him,</a>
<a id='line_3041'>and secure you.</a>
<a id='line_3042'></a>
<a id='line_3043'>28:15 So they took the money, and did as they were taught: and this</a>
<a id='line_3044'>saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day.</a>
<a id='line_3045'></a>
<a id='line_3046'>28:16 Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, into a</a>
<a id='line_3047'>mountain where Jesus had appointed them.</a>
<a id='line_3048'></a>
<a id='line_3049'>28:17 And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.</a>
<a id='line_3050'></a>
<a id='line_3051'>28:18 And Jesus came and spake unto them, saying, All power is given</a>
<a id='line_3052'>unto me in heaven and in earth.</a>
<a id='line_3053'></a>
<a id='line_3054'>28:19 Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the</a>
<a id='line_3055'>name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: 28:20</a>
<a id='line_3056'>Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you:</a>
<a id='line_3057'>and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. Amen.</a>
<a id='line_3058'></a>
