<a id='line_1323'>  "Have you noted how the two lines, 'The light that never was,' etc.,</a>
<a id='line_1324'>  stood in the edition of 1827? I know no other such instance of a</a>

<a id='line_1326'></a>
<a id='line_1327'>The Principal had not remembered at the time that the "perfection of</a>
<a id='line_1328'>ideality" was in the original edition of 1807. The curious thing is that</a>
<a id='line_1329'>the prosaic version of 1820 and 1827 ever took its place. Wordsworth's</a>
<a id='line_1330'>return to his original reading was one of the wisest changes he</a>
<a id='line_1331'>introduced into the text of 1832.--Ed.]</a>
<a id='line_1332'></a>
<a id='line_1333'></a>
<a id='line_1334'></a>
<a id='line_1335'>There is a Peele Castle, on a small rocky island, close to the town of</a>
<a id='line_1336'>Peele, in the Isle of Man; yet separated from it, much as St. Michael's</a>
<a id='line_1337'>Mount in Cornwall is separated from the mainland. This castle was</a>
<a id='line_1338'>believed by many to be the one which Sir George painted, and which gave</a>
<a id='line_1339'>rise to the foregoing lines. I visited it in 1879, being then ignorant</a>
<a id='line_1340'>that any other Peele Castle existed; and although, the day being calm,</a>
<a id='line_1341'>and the season summer, I thought Sir George had idealized his subject</a>
<a id='line_1342'>much--(as I had just left Coleorton, where the picture still exists)--I</a>
<a id='line_1343'>accepted the customary opinion. But I am now convinced, both from the</a>
<a id='line_1344'>testimony of the Arnold family, [B] and as the result of a visit to Piel</a>
<a id='line_1345'>Castle, near Barrow in Furness, that Wordsworth refers to it. The late</a>
<a id='line_1346'>Bishop of Lincoln, in his uncle's 'Memoirs' (vol. i. p. 299), quotes the</a>
<a id='line_1347'>line</a>
<a id='line_1348'></a>
<a id='line_1349'>  "I was thy neighbour once, thou rugged pile,"</a>
<a id='line_1350'></a>
<a id='line_1351'>and adds,</a>
<a id='line_1352'></a>
<a id='line_1353'>  "He had spent four weeks there of a college summer vacation at the</a>
<a id='line_1354'>  house of his cousin, Mr. Barker."</a>
<a id='line_1355'></a>
<a id='line_1356'>This house was at Rampside, the village opposite Piel, on the coast of</a>
<a id='line_1357'>Lancashire. The "rugged pile," too, now "cased in the unfeeling armour</a>
<a id='line_1358'>of old time," painted by Beaumont, is obviously this Piel Castle near</a>
<a id='line_1359'>Barrow. I took the engraving of his picture with me, when visiting it:</a>
<a id='line_1360'>and although Sir George--after the manner of landscape artists of his</a>
<a id='line_1361'>day--took many liberties with his subjects, it is apparent that it was</a>
<a id='line_1362'>this, and not Peele Castle in Mona, that he painted. The "four summer</a>
<a id='line_1363'>weeks" referred to in the first stanza, were those spent at Piel during</a>
<a id='line_1364'>the year 1794.</a>

<a id='line_1552'>At a meeting of "The Wordsworth Society" held at Grasmere, in July 1881,</a>
<a id='line_1553'>it was proposed by one of the members, the Rev. H. D. Rawnsley, then</a>
<a id='line_1554'>Vicar of Wray, to erect some memorial at the parting-place of the</a>
<a id='line_1555'>brothers. The brothers John and William Wordsworth parted at Grisedale</a>
<a id='line_1556'>Tarn, on the 29th September 1800. The originator of the idea wrote thus</a>
<a id='line_1557'>of it in June 1882:</a>
<a id='line_1558'></a>
<a id='line_1559'>  "A proposition, made by one of its members to the Wordsworth Society</a>
<a id='line_1560'>  when it met in Grasmere in 1881, to mark the spot in the Grisedale</a>
<a id='line_1561'>  Pass of Wordsworth's parting from his brother John--and to carry out a</a>
<a id='line_1562'>  wish the poet seems to have hinted at in the last of his elegiac</a>
<a id='line_1563'>  verses in memory of that parting--is now being put into effect. It has</a>
<a id='line_1564'>  been determined, after correspondence with Lord Coleridge, Dr.</a>
<a id='line_1565'>  Cradock, Professor Knight, and Mr. Hills, to have inscribed--(on the</a>
<a id='line_1566'>  native rock, if possible)--the first four lines of Stanzas III. and</a>
<a id='line_1567'>  VII. of these verses:</a>

<a id='line_1576'>    Here let a monumental Stone</a>
<a id='line_1577'>    Stand--sacred as a Shrine.'</a>
<a id='line_1578'></a>
<a id='line_1579'>  The rock selected is a fine mass, facing the east, on the left of the</a>
<a id='line_1580'>  track as one descends from Grisedale Tarn towards Patterdale, and is</a>
<a id='line_1581'>  about 100 yards from the tarn. No more suitable one can be found, and</a>
<a id='line_1582'>  we have the testimony of Mr. David Richardson of Newcastle, who has</a>
<a id='line_1583'>  practical knowledge of engineering, that it is the fittest, both from</a>
<a id='line_1584'>  shape and from slight incline of plane.</a>
<a id='line_1585'></a>
<a id='line_1586'>  It has been proposed to sink a panel in the face of the rock, that so</a>
<a id='line_1587'>  the inscription may be slightly protected, and to engrave the letters</a>
<a id='line_1588'>  upon the face of the panel thus obtained. But it is not quite certain</a>
<a id='line_1589'>  yet that the grain of the rock--volcanic ash--will admit of the</a>
<a id='line_1590'>  lettering. If this cannot be carried out, it has been determined to</a>
<a id='line_1591'>  have the letters engraved upon a slab of Langdale slate, and imbed it</a>
<a id='line_1592'>  in the Grisedale Rock.</a>
<a id='line_1593'></a>
<a id='line_1594'>  It is believed that the simplicity of the design, the lonely isolation</a>
<a id='line_1595'>  of this mountain memorial, will appeal at once</a>
<a id='line_1596'></a>
<a id='line_1597'>    ' ... to the few who pass this way,</a>

<a id='line_1599'></a>
<a id='line_1600'>  And we in our turn appeal to English tourists who may chance to see</a>
<a id='line_1601'>  it, to forego the wish of adding to it, or taking anything from it, by</a>
<a id='line_1602'>  engraving their own names; and to let the Monumental Stone stand, as</a>
<a id='line_1603'>  the poet wished it might</a>

<a id='line_1608'>  ascertain the possibility of finding a mountain rock sufficiently</a>
<a id='line_1609'>  striking in position; to Mr. Richardson, jun., for his etching of the</a>
<a id='line_1610'>  rock, upon which the inscription is to be made; to his father for the</a>
<a id='line_1611'>  kind trouble he took in the measurement of the said rock; and</a>
<a id='line_1612'>  particularly to the seconder of the original proposal, and my</a>
<a id='line_1613'>  coadjutor in the task of final selection and superintending the work,</a>

<a id='line_1616'>  H. D. RAWNSLEY.</a>
<a id='line_1617'></a>
<a id='line_1618'>  _P. S._--When we came to examine the rock, we found the area for the</a>
<a id='line_1619'>  panel less than we had hoped for, owing to certain rock fissures,</a>
<a id='line_1620'>  which, by acting as drains for the rainwater on the surface, would</a>
<a id='line_1621'>  have much interfered with the durability of the inscription. The</a>
<a id='line_1622'>  available space for the panel remains 3 feet 7 in length by 1 foot 9</a>
<a id='line_1623'>  inches in depth. Owing to the fineness of the grain of the stone, it</a>
<a id='line_1624'>  may be quite possible to letter the native rock; but it has been</a>
<a id='line_1625'>  difficult to fix on a style of lettering for the inscription that</a>
<a id='line_1626'>  shall be at once in good taste, forcible, and plain. It was proposed</a>
<a id='line_1627'>  that the Script type of letter which was made use of in the</a>
<a id='line_1628'>  inscription cut on the rock, in the late Mr. Ball's garden grounds</a>
<a id='line_1629'>  below the Mount at Rydal, should be adopted; but a final decision has</a>
<a id='line_1630'>  been given in favour of a style of lettering which Mrs. Rawnsley has</a>
<a id='line_1631'>  designed. The panel is, from its position, certain to attract the eye</a>
<a id='line_1632'>  of the wanderer from Patterdale up to the Grisedale Pass.</a>

<a id='line_1671'>  "... It does me good to weep for him, and it does me good to find that</a>
<a id='line_1672'>  others weep, and I bless them for it. ... It is with me, when I write,</a>
<a id='line_1673'>  as when I am walking out in this vale, once so full of joy. I can turn</a>
<a id='line_1674'>  to no object that does not remind me of our loss. I see nothing that</a>
<a id='line_1675'>  he would not have loved, and enjoyed.... My consolations rather come</a>
<a id='line_1676'>  to me in gusts of feeling, than are the quiet growth of my mind. I</a>
<a id='line_1677'>  know it will not always be so. The time will come when the light of</a>
<a id='line_1678'>  the setting sun upon these mountain tops will be as heretofore a pure</a>
<a id='line_1679'>  joy; not the same _gladness_, that can never be--but yet a joy even</a>
<a id='line_1680'>  more tender. It will soothe me to know how happy he would have been,</a>
<a id='line_1681'>  could he have seen the same beautiful spectacle.... He was taken away</a>
<a id='line_1682'>  in the freshness of his manhood; pure he was, and innocent as a child.</a>
<a id='line_1683'>  Never human being was more thoroughly modest, and his courage I need</a>
<a id='line_1684'>  not speak of. He was 'seen speaking with apparent cheerfulness to the</a>
<a id='line_1685'>  first mate a few minutes before the ship went down;' and when nothing</a>
<a id='line_1686'>  more could be done, He said, 'the will of God be done.' I have no</a>
<a id='line_1687'>  doubt when he felt that it was out of his power to save his life he</a>
<a id='line_1688'>  was as calm as before, if some thought of what we should endure did</a>
<a id='line_1689'>  not awaken a pang.... He loved solitude, and he rejoiced in society.</a>
<a id='line_1690'>  He would wander alone amongst these hills with his fishing-rod, or led</a>
<a id='line_1691'>  on by the mere pleasure of walking, for many hours; or he would walk</a>
<a id='line_1692'>  with W. or me, or both of us, and was continually pointing out--with a</a>
<a id='line_1693'>  gladness which is seldom seen but in very young people--something</a>
<a id='line_1694'>  which perhaps would have escaped our observation; for he had so fine</a>
<a id='line_1695'>  an eye that no distinction was unnoticed by him, and so tender a</a>
<a id='line_1696'>  feeling that he never noticed anything in vain. Many a time has he</a>
<a id='line_1697'>  called out to me at evening to look at the moon or stars, or a cloudy</a>
<a id='line_1698'>  sky, or this vale in the quiet moonlight; but the stars and moon were</a>
<a id='line_1699'>  his chief delight. He made of them his companions when he was at sea,</a>
<a id='line_1700'>  and was never tired of those thoughts which the silence of the night</a>
<a id='line_1701'>  fed in him. Then he was so happy by the fireside. Any little business</a>
<a id='line_1702'>  of the house interested him. He loved our cottage. He helped us to</a>
<a id='line_1703'>  furnish it, and to make the garden. Trees are growing now which he</a>
<a id='line_1704'>  planted.... He staid with us till the 29th of September, having come</a>
<a id='line_1705'>  to us about the end of January. During that time Mary Hutchinson--now</a>
<a id='line_1706'>  Mary Wordsworth--staid with us six weeks. John used to walk with her</a>
<a id='line_1707'>  everywhere, and they were exceedingly attached to each other; so my</a>
<a id='line_1708'>  poor sister mourns with us, not merely because we have lost one who</a>
<a id='line_1709'>  was so dear to William and me, but from tender love to John and an</a>
<a id='line_1710'>  intimate knowledge of him. Her hopes as well as ours were fixed on</a>
<a id='line_1711'>  John.... I can think of nothing but of our departed Brother, yet I am</a>
<a id='line_1712'>  very tranquil to-day. I honour him, and love him, and glory in his</a>
<a id='line_1713'>  memory...."</a>

<a id='line_1715'>Southey, writing to his friend, C. W. W. Wynn, on the 3rd of April 1805,</a>
<a id='line_1716'>says:</a>
<a id='line_1717'></a>
<a id='line_1718'>  "DEAR WYNN,</a>
<a id='line_1719'></a>
<a id='line_1720'>  I have been grievously shocked this evening by the loss of the</a>
<a id='line_1721'>  'Abergavenny', of which Wordsworth's brother was captain. Of course</a>
<a id='line_1722'>  the news came flying up to us from all quarters, and it has disordered</a>
<a id='line_1723'>  me from head to foot. At such circumstances I believe we feel as much</a>
<a id='line_1724'>  for others as for ourselves; just as a violent blow occasions the same</a>
<a id='line_1725'>  pain as a wound, and he who breaks his shin feels as acutely at the</a>
<a id='line_1726'>  moment as the man whose leg is shot off. In fact, I am writing to you</a>
<a id='line_1727'>  merely because this dreadful shipwreck has left me utterly unable to</a>
<a id='line_1728'>  do anything else. It is the heaviest calamity Wordsworth has ever</a>
<a id='line_1729'>  experienced, and in all probability I shall have to communicate it to</a>
<a id='line_1730'>  him, as he will very likely be here before the tidings can reach him.</a>
<a id='line_1731'>  What renders any near loss of this kind so peculiarly distressing is,</a>
<a id='line_1732'>  that the recollection is perpetually freshened when any like event</a>
<a id='line_1733'>  occurs, by the mere mention of shipwreck, or the sound of the wind. Of</a>
<a id='line_1734'>  all deaths it is the most dreadful, from the circumstances of terror</a>

<a id='line_1742'>  "MY DEAR MISS WORDSWORTH,--</a>
<a id='line_1743'></a>
<a id='line_1744'>  I wished to tell you that you would one day feel the kind of peaceful</a>
<a id='line_1745'>  state of mind and sweet memory of the dead, which you so happily</a>
<a id='line_1746'>  describe, as now almost begun; but I felt that it was improper, and</a>
<a id='line_1747'>  most grating to the feelings of the afflicted, to say to them that the</a>
<a id='line_1748'>  memory of their affliction would in time become a constant part, not</a>
<a id='line_1749'>  only of their dreams, but of their most wakeful sense of happiness.</a>
<a id='line_1750'>  That you would see every object with and through your lost brother,</a>
<a id='line_1751'>  and that that would at last become a real and everlasting source of</a>
<a id='line_1752'>  comfort to you, I felt, and well knew, from my own experience in</a>
<a id='line_1753'>  sorrow; but till you yourself began to feel this, I did not dare to</a>
<a id='line_1754'>  tell you so; but I send you some poor lines, which I wrote under this</a>
<a id='line_1755'>  conviction of mind, and before I heard Coleridge was returning home.</a>
<a id='line_1756'></a>
<a id='line_1757'>  ...</a>
<a id='line_1758'></a>
<a id='line_1759'>    "Why is he wandering on the sea?--</a>
<a id='line_1760'>    Coleridge should now with Wordsworth be.</a>
<a id='line_1761'>    By slow degrees he'd steal away</a>
<a id='line_1762'>    Their woes, and gently bring a ray</a>
<a id='line_1763'>    (So happily he'd time relief,)</a>
<a id='line_1764'>    Of comfort from their very grief.</a>
<a id='line_1765'>    He'd tell them that their brother dead,</a>
<a id='line_1766'>    When years have passed o'er their head,</a>
<a id='line_1767'>    Will be remembered with such holy,</a>
<a id='line_1768'>    True and tender melancholy,</a>
<a id='line_1769'>    That ever this lost brother John</a>
<a id='line_1770'>    Will be their heart's companion.</a>
<a id='line_1771'>    His voice they'll always hear,</a>
<a id='line_1772'>      His face they'll always see;</a>

<a id='line_1811'>  Pathway, and lane, and public road, were clogged</a>
<a id='line_1812'>  With frequent showers of snow. Upon a hill</a>

<a id='line_1814'>  A stately Fir-grove, whither I was wont</a>
<a id='line_1815'>  To hasten, for I found, beneath the roof                          10</a>
<a id='line_1816'>  Of that perennial shade, a cloistral place</a>
<a id='line_1817'>  Of refuge, with an unincumbered floor.</a>
<a id='line_1818'>  Here, in safe covert, on the shallow snow,</a>
<a id='line_1819'>  And, sometimes, on a speck of visible earth,</a>
<a id='line_1820'>  The redbreast near me hopped; nor was I loth                      15</a>

<a id='line_1822'>  That, for protection from the nipping blast,</a>
<a id='line_1823'>  Hither repaired.--A single beech-tree grew</a>
<a id='line_1824'>  Within this grove of firs! and, on the fork</a>
<a id='line_1825'>  Of that one beech, appeared a thrush's nest;                      20</a>
<a id='line_1826'>  A last year's nest, conspicuously built</a>
<a id='line_1827'>  At such small elevation from the ground</a>
<a id='line_1828'>  As gave sure sign that they, who in that house</a>
<a id='line_1829'>  Of nature and of love had made their home</a>
<a id='line_1830'>  Amid the fir-trees, all the summer long                           25</a>
<a id='line_1831'>  Dwelt in a tranquil spot. And oftentimes,</a>
<a id='line_1832'>  A few sheep, stragglers from some mountain-flock,</a>
<a id='line_1833'>  Would watch my motions with suspicious stare,</a>
<a id='line_1834'>  From the remotest outskirts of the grove,--</a>
<a id='line_1835'>  Some nook where they had made their final stand,                  30</a>
<a id='line_1836'>  Huddling together from two fears--the fear</a>
<a id='line_1837'>  Of me and of the storm. Full many an hour</a>
<a id='line_1838'>  Here did I lose. But in this grove the trees</a>
<a id='line_1839'>  Had been so thickly planted, and had thriven</a>
<a id='line_1840'>  In such perplexed and intricate array;                            35</a>
<a id='line_1841'>  That vainly did I seek, beneath [1] their stems</a>
<a id='line_1842'>  A length of open space, where to and fro</a>
<a id='line_1843'>  My feet might move without concern or care;</a>
<a id='line_1844'>  And, baffled thus, though earth from day to day</a>
<a id='line_1845'>  Was fettered, and the air by storm disturbed,                     40</a>
<a id='line_1846'>  I ceased the shelter to frequent, [2]--and prized,</a>
<a id='line_1847'>  Less than I wished to prize, that calm recess.</a>

<a id='line_1853'>  To this forsaken covert, there I found</a>

<a id='line_1855'>  And winding on with such an easy line</a>
<a id='line_1856'>  Along a natural opening, that I stood                             50</a>
<a id='line_1857'>  Much wondering how I could have sought in vain [3]</a>

<a id='line_1867'>  A heart more wakeful; and had worn the track [8]</a>

<a id='line_1889'>  Still couchant, an inevitable ear,</a>

<a id='line_2077'></a>
<a id='line_2078'>For the date of this poem in the Chronological Tables given in the</a>
<a id='line_2079'>editions of 1815 and 1820, Wordsworth assigned the year 1802. But, in</a>
<a id='line_2080'>the edition of 1836, he assigned it to the year 1805, the date retained</a>
<a id='line_2081'>by Mr. Carter in the edition of 1857. Captain Wordsworth perished on the</a>
<a id='line_2082'>5th of February 1805; and if the poem was written in 1805, it must have</a>
<a id='line_2083'>been in the month of January of that year. The note to the poem is</a>
<a id='line_2084'>explicit--"Not long after" he "perished by shipwreck," etc. Thus the</a>
<a id='line_2085'>poem _may_ have been written in the beginning of 1805; but it is not at</a>
<a id='line_2086'>all certain that part of it at least does not belong to an earlier year.</a>
<a id='line_2087'>John Wordsworth lived with his brother and sister at the Town-end</a>
<a id='line_2088'>Cottage, Grasmere, during part of the winter, and during the whole of</a>
<a id='line_2089'>the spring, summer, and autumn of 1800, William and John going together</a>
<a id='line_2090'>on foot into Yorkshire from the 14th of May to the 7th of June. John</a>
<a id='line_2091'>left Grasmere on Michaelmas day (September 29th) 1800, and never</a>
<a id='line_2092'>returned to it again. The following is Miss Wordsworth's record of that</a>
<a id='line_2093'>day in her Journal of 1800:</a>
<a id='line_2094'></a>
<a id='line_2095'>  "On Monday, 29th, John left us. William and I parted with him in sight</a>
<a id='line_2096'>  of Ullswater. It was a fine day, showery, but with sunshine and fine</a>
<a id='line_2097'>  clouds. Poor fellow, my heart was right sad, I could not help thinking</a>
<a id='line_2098'>  we should see him again, because he was only going to Penrith."</a>
<a id='line_2099'></a>
<a id='line_2100'>In the spring of 1801, John Wordsworth sailed for China in the</a>
<a id='line_2101'>'Abergavenny'.  He returned from this voyage in safety, and the brothers</a>
<a id='line_2102'>met once again in London. He went to sea again in 1803, and returned to</a>
<a id='line_2103'>London in 1804, but could not visit Grasmere; and in the month of</a>
<a id='line_2104'>February 1805--shortly after he was appointed to the command of the</a>
<a id='line_2105'>'Abergavenny'--the ship was lost at the Bill of Portland, and every one</a>
<a id='line_2106'>on board perished. It is clear that the latter part of the poem, "When,</a>
<a id='line_2107'>to the attractions of the busy world," was written between John</a>
<a id='line_2108'>Wordsworth's departure from Grasmere and the loss of the 'Abergavenny',</a>
<a id='line_2109'>i. e. between September 1800 and February 1805, as there are references</a>
<a id='line_2110'>in it both to what his brother did at Grasmere and to his return to</a>
<a id='line_2111'>sea:</a>
<a id='line_2112'></a>
<a id='line_2113'>  'Back to the joyless Ocean thou art gone.'</a>
<a id='line_2114'></a>
<a id='line_2115'>There are some things in the earlier part of the poem that appear to</a>
<a id='line_2116'>negative the idea of its having been written in 1800. The opening lines</a>
<a id='line_2117'>seem to hint at an experience somewhat distant. He speaks of being</a>
<a id='line_2118'>"wont" to do certain things. But, on the other hand, I find an entry in</a>
<a id='line_2119'>Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal, which leads me to believe that the poem</a>
<a id='line_2120'>may have been begun in 1800, and that the first part, ending (as it did</a>
<a id='line_2121'>then) with the line:</a>
<a id='line_2122'></a>
<a id='line_2123'>  'While she is travelling through the dreary sea,'</a>
<a id='line_2124'></a>
<a id='line_2125'>may have been finished before John Wordsworth left Grasmere;</a>
<a id='line_2126'>the second part being written afterwards, while he was at sea;</a>
<a id='line_2127'>and that this is the explanation of the date given in the editions</a>
<a id='line_2128'>of 1815 and 1820, viz. 1802.</a>
<a id='line_2129'></a>
<a id='line_2130'>Passages occur in Dorothy Wordsworth's Journal to the</a>
<a id='line_2131'>following effect:</a>
<a id='line_2132'></a>
<a id='line_2133'>  "Monday Morning, 1st September.--We walked in the wood by the lake.</a>
<a id='line_2134'>  William read 'Joanna' and 'the Firgrove' to Coleridge."</a>
<a id='line_2135'></a>
<a id='line_2136'>A little earlier there is the record,</a>
<a id='line_2137'></a>
<a id='line_2138'>  "Saturday, 22nd August.--William was composing all the morning....</a>
<a id='line_2139'>  William read us the poem of 'Joanna' beside the Rothay by the</a>
<a id='line_2140'>  roadside."</a>
<a id='line_2141'></a>
<a id='line_2142'>Then, on Friday, the 25th August, there is the entry,</a>
<a id='line_2143'></a>
<a id='line_2144'>  "We walked over the hill by the Firgrove, I sate upon a rock and</a>
<a id='line_2145'>  observed a flight of swallows gathering together high above my head.</a>
<a id='line_2146'>  We walked through the wood to the stepping stones, the lake of Rydale</a>
<a id='line_2147'>  very beautiful, partly still, I left William to compose an</a>
<a id='line_2148'>  inscription, that about the path...."</a>
<a id='line_2149'></a>
<a id='line_2150'>Then, next day,</a>
<a id='line_2151'></a>
<a id='line_2152'>  "Saturday morning, 30th August.--William finished his inscription of</a>
<a id='line_2153'>  the Pathway, then walked in the wood, and when John returned he sought</a>
<a id='line_2154'>  him, and they bathed together."</a>
<a id='line_2155'></a>
<a id='line_2156'>To what poem Dorothy Wordsworth referred under the name of the</a>
<a id='line_2157'>"Inscription of the Pathway" has puzzled me much. There is no poem</a>
<a id='line_2158'>amongst his "Inscriptions" (written in or before August 1800) that</a>
<a id='line_2159'>corresponds to it in the least. But, if my conjecture is right that this</a>
<a id='line_2160'>"Poem on the Naming of Places," beginning:</a>
<a id='line_2161'></a>
<a id='line_2162'>  'When, to the attractions of the busy world,'</a>
<a id='line_2163'></a>
<a id='line_2164'>was composed at two different times, it is quite possible that "the</a>
<a id='line_2165'>Firgrove" which was read--along with 'Joanna'--to Coleridge on September</a>
<a id='line_2166'>1st, 1800, was the first part of this very poem.</a>
<a id='line_2167'></a>
<a id='line_2168'>If this supposition is correct, some light is cast both on the</a>
<a id='line_2169'>"Inscription of the Pathway." and on the date assigned by Wordsworth</a>
<a id='line_2170'>himself to the poem. There is a certain fitness, however, in this poem</a>
<a id='line_2171'>being placed--as it now is--in sequence to the 'Elegiac Verses' in</a>
<a id='line_2172'>memory of John Wordsworth, beginning, "The Sheep-boy whistled loud," and</a>
<a id='line_2173'>near the fourth poem 'To the Daisy', beginning, "Sweet Flower! belike</a>
<a id='line_2174'>one day to have."</a>
<a id='line_2175'></a>
<a id='line_2176'>The "Fir-grove" still exists. It is between Wishing Gate and White Moss</a>
<a id='line_2177'>Common, and almost exactly opposite the former. Standing at the gate and</a>
<a id='line_2178'>looking eastwards, the grove is to the left, not forty yards distant.</a>
<a id='line_2179'>Some of the firs (Scotch ones) still survive, and several beech trees,</a>
<a id='line_2180'>not "a single beech-tree," as in the poem. From this, one might infer</a>
<a id='line_2181'>that the present colony had sprung up since the beginning of the</a>
<a id='line_2182'>century, and that the special tree, in which was the thrush's nest, had</a>
<a id='line_2183'>perished; but Dr. Cradock wrote to me that "Wordsworth pointed out the</a>
<a id='line_2184'>tree to Miss Cookson a few days before Dora Wordsworth's death. The tree</a>
<a id='line_2185'>is near the upper wall and tells its own tale." The Fir-grove--"John's</a>
<a id='line_2186'>Grove"--can easily be entered by a gate about a hundred yards beyond</a>
<a id='line_2187'>the Wishing-gate, as one goes toward Rydal. The view from it, the</a>
<a id='line_2188'>"visionary scene,"</a>
<a id='line_2189'></a>
<a id='line_2190'>                           'the spectacle</a>
<a id='line_2191'>  Of clouded splendour, ... this dream-like sight</a>
<a id='line_2192'>  Of solemn loveliness,'</a>
<a id='line_2193'></a>
<a id='line_2194'>is now much interfered with by the new larch plantations immediately</a>
<a id='line_2195'>below the firs. It must have been very different in Wordsworth's time,</a>
<a id='line_2196'>and is constantly referred to in his sister's Journal as a favourite</a>
<a id='line_2197'>retreat, resorted to</a>
<a id='line_2198'></a>
<a id='line_2199'>                           'when cloudless suns</a>
<a id='line_2200'>  Shone hot, or wind blew troublesome and strong.'</a>
<a id='line_2201'></a>
<a id='line_2202'>In the absence of contrary testimony, it might be supposed that "the</a>
<a id='line_2203'>track" which the brother had "worn,"</a>
<a id='line_2204'></a>
<a id='line_2205'>  'By pacing here, unwearied and alone,'</a>
<a id='line_2206'></a>
<a id='line_2207'>faced Silver-How and the Grasmere Island, and that the single beech tree</a>
<a id='line_2208'>was nearer the lower than the upper wall. But Miss Cookson's testimony</a>
<a id='line_2209'>is explicit. Only a few fir trees survive at this part of the grove,</a>
<a id='line_2210'>which is now open and desolate, not as it was in those earlier days,</a>
<a id='line_2211'>when</a>
<a id='line_2212'></a>
<a id='line_2213'>                                  'the trees</a>
<a id='line_2214'>  Had been so thickly planted, and had thriven</a>
<a id='line_2215'>  With such perplexed and intricate array,</a>
<a id='line_2216'>  That vainly did I seek, beneath their stems</a>
<a id='line_2217'>  A length of open space ...'</a>
<a id='line_2218'></a>
<a id='line_2219'>Dr. Cradock remarks,</a>
<a id='line_2220'></a>
<a id='line_2221'>  "As to there being more than one beech, Wordsworth would not have</a>
<a id='line_2222'>  hesitated to sacrifice servile exactness to poetical effect." He had a</a>
<a id='line_2223'>  fancy for "one"--</a>
<a id='line_2224'></a>
<a id='line_2225'>    'Fair as a star when only one</a>
<a id='line_2226'>    Is shining in the sky;'</a>
<a id='line_2227'></a>

<a id='line_2280'>This poem underwent no change in successive editions. The title in all</a>
<a id='line_2281'>the earlier ones (1815 to 1843) was 'The Cottager to her Infant. By a</a>
<a id='line_2282'>Female Friend'; and in the preface to the edition of 1815, Wordsworth</a>
<a id='line_2283'>wrote,</a>
<a id='line_2284'></a>
<a id='line_2285'>  "Three short pieces (now first published) are the work of a Female</a>
<a id='line_2286'>  Friend; ... if any one regard them with dislike, or be disposed to</a>
<a id='line_2287'>  condemn them, let the censure fall upon him, who, trusting in his own</a>
<a id='line_2288'>  sense of their merit, and their fitness for the place which they</a>
<a id='line_2289'>  occupy, _extorted_ them from the Authoress."</a>
<a id='line_2290'></a>
<a id='line_2291'>In the edition of 1845, he disclosed the authorship; and gave the more</a>
<a id='line_2292'>natural title, 'By my Sister'. Other two poems by her were introduced</a>
<a id='line_2293'>into the edition of 1815, and subsequent ones, viz. the 'Address to a</a>
<a id='line_2294'>Child', and 'The Mother's Return'. In an appendix to a MS. copy of the</a>
<a id='line_2295'>'Recollections of a Tour made in Scotland', by Dorothy Wordsworth,</a>
<a id='line_2296'>transcribed by Mrs. Clarkson, I find the poem 'The Cottager to her</a>
<a id='line_2297'>Infant' with two additional stanzas, which are there attributed to</a>
<a id='line_2298'>Wordsworth. The appendix runs thus:</a>
<a id='line_2299'></a>
<a id='line_2300'>  "To my Niece Dorothy, a sleepless Baby</a>
<a id='line_2301'></a>
<a id='line_2302'>    THE COTTAGER TO HER INFANT</a>
<a id='line_2303'></a>
<a id='line_2304'>  (The third and fourth stanzas which follow by W. W.)</a>
<a id='line_2305'></a>
<a id='line_2306'>    'Ah! if I were a lady gay</a>
<a id='line_2307'>    I should not grieve with thee to play;</a>
<a id='line_2308'>    Right gladly would I lie awake</a>
<a id='line_2309'>    Thy lively spirits to partake,</a>
<a id='line_2310'>      And ask no better cheer.</a>
<a id='line_2311'></a>
<a id='line_2312'>    But, Babe! there's none to work for me.</a>
<a id='line_2313'>    And I must rise to industry;</a>

<a id='line_2350'>MY DEAR FRIEND,</a>
<a id='line_2351'></a>
<a id='line_2352'>When I sent you, a few weeks ago, the Tale of 'Peter Bell', you asked</a>
<a id='line_2353'>"why THE WAGGONER was not added?"--To say the truth,--from the higher</a>
<a id='line_2354'>tone of imagination, and the deeper touches of passion aimed at in the</a>
<a id='line_2355'>former, I apprehended, this little Piece could not accompany it without</a>
<a id='line_2356'>disadvantage. In the year 1806, if I am not mistaken, THE WAGGONER was</a>
<a id='line_2357'>read to you in manuscript; and, as you have remembered it for so long a</a>
<a id='line_2358'>time, I am the more encouraged to hope, that, since the localities on</a>
<a id='line_2359'>which it partly depends did not prevent its being interesting to you, it</a>
<a id='line_2360'>may prove acceptable to others. Being therefore in some measure the</a>
<a id='line_2361'>cause of its present appearance, you must allow me the gratification of</a>
<a id='line_2362'>inscribing it to you; in acknowledgment of the pleasure I have derived</a>
<a id='line_2363'>from your Writings, and of the high esteem with which</a>

<a id='line_2531'>  A storm, which had been smothered long,</a>

<a id='line_2534'>  Was busily employed as he.</a>
<a id='line_2535'>  The thunder had begun to growl--</a>

<a id='line_2556'>  Puzzling aloft [26] his curious wits;</a>
<a id='line_2557'>  He whose domain is held in common</a>
<a id='line_2558'>  With no one but the ANCIENT WOMAN,                               175</a>
<a id='line_2559'>  Cowering beside her rifted cell,</a>
<a id='line_2560'>  As if intent on magic spell;-</a>
<a id='line_2561'>  Dread pair, that, spite of wind and weather,</a>
<a id='line_2562'>  Still sit upon Helm-crag together!</a>
<a id='line_2563'></a>
<a id='line_2564'>    The ASTROLOGER was not unseen                                  180</a>
<a id='line_2565'>  By solitary Benjamin;</a>
<a id='line_2566'>  But total darkness came anon,</a>
<a id='line_2567'>  And he and every thing was gone:</a>
<a id='line_2568'>  And suddenly a ruffling breeze,</a>
<a id='line_2569'>  (That would have rocked the sounding trees                       185</a>
<a id='line_2570'>  Had aught of sylvan growth been there)</a>
<a id='line_2571'>  Swept through the Hollow long and bare: [27]</a>
<a id='line_2572'>  The rain rushed down--the road was battered,</a>
<a id='line_2573'>  As with the force of billows shattered;</a>
<a id='line_2574'>  The horses are dismayed, nor know                                190</a>
<a id='line_2575'>  Whether they should stand or go;</a>
<a id='line_2576'>  And Benjamin is groping near them,</a>
<a id='line_2577'>  Sees nothing, and can scarcely hear them.</a>
<a id='line_2578'>  He is astounded,--wonder not,--</a>
<a id='line_2579'>  With such a charge in such a spot;                               195</a>
<a id='line_2580'>  Astounded in the mountain gap</a>
<a id='line_2581'>  With thunder-peals, clap after clap,</a>
<a id='line_2582'>  Close-treading on the silent flashes--</a>
<a id='line_2583'>  And somewhere, as he thinks, by crashes [28]</a>
<a id='line_2584'>  Among the rocks; with weight of rain,                            200</a>
<a id='line_2585'>  And sullen [29] motions long and slow,</a>
<a id='line_2586'>  That to a dreary distance go--</a>
<a id='line_2587'>  Till, breaking in upon the dying strain,</a>
<a id='line_2588'>  A rending o'er his head begins the fray again.</a>
<a id='line_2589'></a>
<a id='line_2590'>    Meanwhile, uncertain what to do,                               205</a>
<a id='line_2591'>  And oftentimes compelled to halt,</a>
<a id='line_2592'>  The horses cautiously pursue</a>
<a id='line_2593'>  Their way, without mishap or fault;</a>
<a id='line_2594'>  And now have reached that pile of stones,</a>
<a id='line_2595'>  Heaped over brave King Dunmail's bones;                          210</a>
<a id='line_2596'>  He who had once supreme command,</a>
<a id='line_2597'>  Last king of rocky Cumberland;</a>
<a id='line_2598'>  His bones, and those of all his Power,</a>
<a id='line_2599'>  Slain here in a disastrous hour!</a>
<a id='line_2600'></a>
<a id='line_2601'>    When, passing through this narrow strait,                      215</a>
<a id='line_2602'>  Stony, and dark, and desolate,</a>
<a id='line_2603'>  Benjamin can faintly hear</a>
<a id='line_2604'>  A voice that comes from some one near,</a>
<a id='line_2605'>  A female voice:--"Whoe'er you be,</a>
<a id='line_2606'>  Stop," it exclaimed, "and pity me!"                              220</a>
<a id='line_2607'>  And, less in pity than in wonder,</a>
<a id='line_2608'>  Amid the darkness and the thunder,</a>
<a id='line_2609'>  The Waggoner, with prompt command,</a>
<a id='line_2610'>  Summons his horses to a stand.</a>
<a id='line_2611'></a>
<a id='line_2612'>    While, with increasing agitation,                              225</a>
<a id='line_2613'>  The Woman urged her supplication,</a>
<a id='line_2614'>  In rueful words, with sobs between--</a>
<a id='line_2615'>  The voice of tears that fell unseen; [30]</a>
<a id='line_2616'>  There came a flash--a startling glare,</a>
<a id='line_2617'>  And all Seat-Sandal was laid bare!                               230</a>
<a id='line_2618'>  'Tis not a time for nice suggestion,</a>
<a id='line_2619'>  And Benjamin, without a question,</a>
<a id='line_2620'>  Taking her for some way-worn rover, [31]</a>
<a id='line_2621'>  Said, "Mount, and get you under cover!"</a>
<a id='line_2622'>  Another voice, in tone as hoarse                                 235</a>
<a id='line_2623'>  As a swoln brook with rugged course,</a>
<a id='line_2624'>  Cried out, "Good brother, why so fast?</a>
<a id='line_2625'>  I've had a glimpse of you--'avast!'</a>
<a id='line_2626'>  Or, since it suits you to be civil,</a>
<a id='line_2627'>  Take her at once--for good and evil!"                            240</a>
<a id='line_2628'></a>
<a id='line_2629'>  "It is my Husband," softly said</a>
<a id='line_2630'>  The Woman, as if half afraid:</a>
<a id='line_2631'>  By this time she was snug within,</a>
<a id='line_2632'>  Through help of honest Benjamin;</a>
<a id='line_2633'>  She and her Babe, which to her breast                            245</a>
<a id='line_2634'>  With thankfulness the Mother pressed;</a>
<a id='line_2635'>  And now the same strong voice more near</a>
<a id='line_2636'>  Said cordially, "My Friend, what cheer?</a>
<a id='line_2637'>  Rough doings these! as God's my judge,</a>
<a id='line_2638'>  The sky owes somebody a grudge!                                  250</a>
<a id='line_2639'>  We've had in half an hour or less</a>
<a id='line_2640'>  A twelvemonth's terror [32] and distress!"</a>
<a id='line_2641'></a>
<a id='line_2642'>  Then Benjamin entreats the Man</a>
<a id='line_2643'>  Would mount, too, quickly as he can:</a>
<a id='line_2644'>  The Sailor--Sailor now no more,                                  255</a>
<a id='line_2645'>  But such he had been heretofore--</a>
<a id='line_2646'>  To courteous Benjamin replied,</a>
<a id='line_2647'>  "Go you your way, and mind not me;</a>
<a id='line_2648'>  For I must have, whate'er betide,</a>
<a id='line_2649'>  My Ass and fifty things beside,--260</a>
<a id='line_2650'>  Go, and I'll follow speedily!"</a>
<a id='line_2651'></a>
<a id='line_2652'>  The Waggon moves--and with its load</a>
<a id='line_2653'>  Descends along the sloping road;</a>
<a id='line_2654'>  And the rough Sailor instantly</a>
<a id='line_2655'>  Turns to a little tent hard by: [33]                             265</a>
<a id='line_2656'>  For when, at closing-in of day,</a>
<a id='line_2657'>  The family had come that way,</a>
<a id='line_2658'>  Green pasture and the soft warm air</a>
<a id='line_2659'>  Tempted [34] them to settle there.--</a>
<a id='line_2660'>  Green is the grass for beast to graze,                           270</a>
<a id='line_2661'>  Around the stones of Dunmail-raise!</a>
<a id='line_2662'></a>
<a id='line_2663'>  The Sailor gathers up his bed,</a>
<a id='line_2664'>  Takes down the canvass overhead;</a>
<a id='line_2665'>  And, after farewell to the place,</a>
<a id='line_2666'>  A parting word--though not of grace,                             275</a>
<a id='line_2667'>  Pursues, with Ass and all his store,</a>
<a id='line_2668'>  The way the Waggon went before.</a>

<a id='line_2842'>  Then, like a hero crowned with laurel,</a>
<a id='line_2843'>  Back to her place the ship he led;</a>

<a id='line_2990'></a>
<a id='line_2991'>    This explanation stilled the alarm,</a>
<a id='line_2992'>  Cured the foreboder like a charm;</a>

<a id='line_4146'>There is no poem more closely identified with the Grasmere district of</a>
<a id='line_4147'>the English Lakes--and with the road from Grasmere to Keswick--than 'The</a>
<a id='line_4148'>Waggoner' is, and in none are the topographical allusions more minute</a>
<a id='line_4149'>and faithful.</a>
<a id='line_4150'></a>
<a id='line_4151'>Wordsworth seemed at a loss to know in what "class" of his poems to</a>
<a id='line_4152'>place 'The Waggoner;' and his frequent changes--removing it from one</a>
<a id='line_4153'>group to another--shew the artificial character of these classes. Thus,</a>
<a id='line_4154'>in the edition of 1820, it stood first among the "Poems of the Fancy."</a>
<a id='line_4155'>In 1827 it was the last of the "Poems founded on the Affections." In</a>
<a id='line_4156'>1832 it was reinstated among the "Poems of the Fancy." In 1836 it had a</a>
<a id='line_4157'>place of its own, and was inserted between the "Poems of the Fancy" and</a>
<a id='line_4158'>those "Founded on the Affections;" while in 1845 it was sent back to its</a>
<a id='line_4159'>original place among the "Poems of the Fancy;" although in the table of</a>
<a id='line_4160'>contents it was printed as an independent poem, closing the series.</a>
<a id='line_4161'></a>
<a id='line_4162'>The original text of 'The Waggoner' underwent little change, till the</a>
<a id='line_4163'>year 1836, when it was carefully revised, and altered throughout. The</a>
<a id='line_4164'>final edition of 1845, however, reverted, in many instances--especially</a>
<a id='line_4165'>in the first canto--to the original text of 1819.</a>
<a id='line_4166'></a>
<a id='line_4167'>As this poem was dedicated to Charles Lamb, it may be of interest to</a>
<a id='line_4168'>note that, some six months afterwards, Lamb presented Wordsworth with a</a>
<a id='line_4169'>copy of the first edition of 'Paradise Regained' (the edition of 1671),</a>
<a id='line_4170'>writing on it the following sentence,</a>
<a id='line_4171'></a>
<a id='line_4172'>  "Charles Lamb, to the best knower of Milton, and therefore the</a>
<a id='line_4173'>  worthiest occupant of this pleasant edition.--Jan. 2nd, 1820."</a>

<a id='line_4274'>Waggoner on a summer morning, are as true to the spirit of the place as</a>
<a id='line_4275'>anything that Wordsworth has written. He tells his friend Lamb, fourteen</a>
<a id='line_4276'>years after he wrote the poem of 'The Waggoner,'</a>
<a id='line_4277'></a>
<a id='line_4278'>  'Yes, I, and all about me here,</a>
<a id='line_4279'>  Through all the changes of the year,</a>

<a id='line_4301'>  As lowly as the lowliest dwelling,'</a>
<a id='line_4302'></a>
<a id='line_4303'>remains very much as it was in 1805; but the primitive simplicity and</a>
<a id='line_4304'>"lowliness" of the chapel was changed by the addition a few years ago of</a>
<a id='line_4305'>an apse, by the removal of some of the old rafters, and by the reseating</a>
<a id='line_4306'>of the pews.</a>
<a id='line_4307'></a>
<a id='line_4308'>The Cherry Tree Tavern, where "the village Merry-night" was being</a>
<a id='line_4309'>celebrated, still stands on the eastern or Helvellyn side of the road.</a>
<a id='line_4310'>It is now a farm-house; but it will be regarded with interest from the</a>
<a id='line_4311'>description of the rustic dance, which recalls ('longo intervallo') 'The</a>
<a id='line_4312'>Jolly Beggars' of Burns. After two hours' delay at the Cherry Tree, the</a>
<a id='line_4313'>Waggoner and Sailor "coast the silent lake" of Thirlmere, and pass the</a>
<a id='line_4314'>Rock of Names.</a>
<a id='line_4315'></a>
<a id='line_4316'>This rock was, until lately, one of the most interesting memorials of</a>
<a id='line_4317'>Wordsworth and his friends that survived in the Lake District; but the</a>
<a id='line_4318'>vale of Thirlmere is now a Manchester water-tank, and the place which</a>
<a id='line_4319'>knew the Rock of Names now knows it no more. It was a sort of trysting</a>
<a id='line_4320'>place of the poets of Grasmere and Keswick--being nearly half-way</a>
<a id='line_4321'>between the two places--and there, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and other</a>
<a id='line_4322'>members of their households often met. When Coleridge left Grasmere for</a>
<a id='line_4323'>Keswick, the Wordsworths usually accompanied him as far as this rock;</a>
<a id='line_4324'>and they often met him there on his way over from Keswick to Grasmere.</a>
<a id='line_4325'>Compare the Hon. Mr. Justice Coleridge's Reminiscences. ('Memoirs of</a>
<a id='line_4326'>Wordsworth,' vol. ii. p. 310.)</a>
<a id='line_4327'></a>
<a id='line_4328'>The rock was on the right hand of the road, a little way past Waterhead,</a>
<a id='line_4329'>at the southern end of Thirlmere; and on it were cut the letters,</a>
<a id='line_4330'></a>
<a id='line_4331'>  W. W.</a>
<a id='line_4332'>  M. H.</a>
<a id='line_4333'>  D. W.</a>
<a id='line_4334'>  S. T. C.</a>
<a id='line_4335'>  J. W.</a>
<a id='line_4336'>  S. H.</a>
<a id='line_4337'></a>
<a id='line_4338'>the initials of William Wordsworth, Mary Hutchinson, Dorothy Wordsworth,</a>
<a id='line_4339'>Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Wordsworth, and Sarah Hutchinson. The</a>
<a id='line_4340'>Wordsworths settled at Grasmere at the close of the year 1799. As</a>
<a id='line_4341'>mentioned in a previous note, John Wordsworth lived with his brother and</a>
<a id='line_4342'>sister during most of that winter, and during the whole of the spring,</a>
<a id='line_4343'>summer, and autumn of 1800, leaving it finally on September 29, 1800.</a>
<a id='line_4344'>These names must therefore have been cut during the spring or summer of</a>
<a id='line_4345'>1800. There is no record of the occurrence, and no allusion to the rock,</a>
<a id='line_4346'>in Dorothy Wordsworth's Grasmere Journal of 1800. But that Journal, so</a>
<a id='line_4347'>far as I have seen it, begins on the 14th of May 1800. Almost every</a>
<a id='line_4348'>detail of the daily life and ways of the household at Dove Cottage is so</a>
<a id='line_4349'>minutely recorded in it, that I am convinced that this incident of the</a>
<a id='line_4350'>cutting of names in the Thirlmere Rock would have been mentioned, had it</a>
<a id='line_4351'>happened between the 14th of May and John Wordsworth's departure from</a>
<a id='line_4352'>Grasmere in September. Such references as this, for example, occur in</a>
<a id='line_4353'>the Journal:</a>
<a id='line_4354'></a>
<a id='line_4355'>  "Saturday, August 2.--William and Coleridge went to Keswick. John went</a>
<a id='line_4356'>  with them to Wytheburn, and staid all day fishing."</a>
<a id='line_4357'></a>
<a id='line_4358'>I therefore infer that it was in the spring or early summer of 1800 that</a>
<a id='line_4359'>the names were cut.</a>
<a id='line_4360'></a>
<a id='line_4361'>I may add that the late Dean of Westminster--Dean Stanley--took much</a>
<a id='line_4362'>interest in this Rock of Names; and doubt having been cast on the</a>
<a id='line_4363'>accuracy of the place and the genuineness of the inscriptions, in a</a>
<a id='line_4364'>letter from Dr. Fraser, then Bishop of Manchester, which he forwarded to</a>
<a id='line_4365'>me, he entered into the question with all the interest with which he was</a>
<a id='line_4366'>wont to track out details in the architecture or the history of a</a>
<a id='line_4367'>Church.</a>
<a id='line_4368'></a>
<a id='line_4369'>There were few memorials connected with Wordsworth more worthy of</a>
<a id='line_4370'>preservation than this "upright mural block of stone." When one</a>
<a id='line_4371'>remembered that the initials on the rock were graven by the hands of</a>
<a id='line_4372'>William and John Wordsworth, by Samuel Taylor Coleridge, possibly with</a>
<a id='line_4373'>the assistance of Dorothy Wordsworth, the two Hutchinsons (Mary and</a>
<a id='line_4374'>Sarah), and that Wordsworth says of it,</a>
<a id='line_4375'></a>
<a id='line_4376'>  'We worked until the Initials took</a>
<a id='line_4377'>  Shapes that defied a scornful look,'</a>
<a id='line_4378'></a>
<a id='line_4379'>this Thirlmere Rock was felt to be a far more interesting memento of the</a>
<a id='line_4380'>group of poets that used to meet beside it, than the Stone in the</a>
<a id='line_4381'>grounds of Rydal Mount, which was spared at Wordsworth's suit, "from</a>
<a id='line_4382'>some rude beauty of its own." There was simplicity, as well as strength,</a>
<a id='line_4383'>in the way in which the initials were cut. But the stone was afterwards</a>
<a id='line_4384'>desecrated by tourists, and others, who had the audacity to scratch</a>
<a id='line_4385'>their own names or initials upon it. In 1877 I wrote, "The rock is as</a>
<a id='line_4386'>yet wonderfully free from such; and its preservation is probably due to</a>
<a id='line_4387'>the dark olive-coloured moss, with which the 'pure water trickling down'</a>
<a id='line_4388'>has covered the face of the 'mural block,' and thus secured it from</a>
<a id='line_4389'>observation, even on that highway;" but I found in the summer of 1882</a>
<a id='line_4390'>that several other names had been ruthlessly added. When the Manchester</a>
<a id='line_4391'>Thirlmere scheme was finally resolved upon, an effort was made to remove</a>
<a id='line_4392'>the Stone, with the view of its being placed higher up the hill on the</a>
<a id='line_4393'>side of the new roadway. In the course of this attempt, the Stone was</a>
<a id='line_4394'>broken to pieces.</a>
<a id='line_4395'></a>
<a id='line_4396'>There is a very good drawing of "The Rock of Names" by Mr. Harry</a>

<a id='line_4402'></a>
<a id='line_4403'>  'Quits the slow-paced waggon's side,</a>

<a id='line_4406'></a>
<a id='line_4407'>The "hawthorn dell" is the upper part of the Vale of St. John.</a>

<a id='line_4413'>  Each peering forth to meet the other.'</a>
<a id='line_4414'></a>
<a id='line_4415'>Raven-crag is well known,--H.C. Robinson writes of it in his 'Diary' in</a>
<a id='line_4416'>1818, as "the most significant of the crags at a spot where there is not</a>
<a id='line_4417'>one insignificant,"--a rock on the western side of Thirlmere, where the</a>
<a id='line_4418'>Greta issues from the lake. But there is no rock in the district now</a>
<a id='line_4419'>called by the name of Ghimmer-crag, or the crag of the Ewe-lamb. I am</a>
<a id='line_4420'>inclined to think that Wordsworth referred to the "Fisher-crag" of the</a>
<a id='line_4421'>Ordnance Survey and the Guide Books. No other rock round Thirlmere can</a>
<a id='line_4422'>with any accuracy be called the "tall twin brother" of Raven-crag:</a>
<a id='line_4423'>certainly not Great How, nor any spur of High Seat or Bleaberry Fell.</a>
<a id='line_4424'>Fisher-crag resembles Raven-crag, as seen from Thirlmere Bridge, or from</a>
<a id='line_4425'>the high road above it; and it is somewhat remarkable that Green--in his</a>
<a id='line_4426'>Guide to the Lakes (a volume which the poet possessed)--makes use of the</a>
<a id='line_4427'>same expression as that which Wordsworth adopts regarding these two</a>
<a id='line_4428'>crags, Raven and Fisher.</a>
<a id='line_4429'></a>
<a id='line_4430'>  "The margin of the lake on the Dalehead side has its charms of wood</a>
<a id='line_4431'>  and water; and Fischer Crag, twin brother to Raven Crag, is no bad</a>
<a id='line_4432'>  object, when taken near the island called Buck's Holm"</a>

<a id='line_4434'>('A Description of Sixty Studies from Nature', by William Green of</a>
<a id='line_4435'>Ambleside, 1810, p. 57). I cannot find any topographical allusion to a</a>
<a id='line_4436'>Ghimmer-crag in contemporary local writers. Clarke, in his 'Survey of</a>
<a id='line_4437'>the Lakes', does not mention it.</a>
<a id='line_4438'></a>
<a id='line_4439'>The Castle Rock, in the Vale of Legberthwaite, between High Fell and</a>
<a id='line_4440'>Great How, is the fairy castle of Sir Walter Scott's 'Bridal of</a>
<a id='line_4441'>Triermain'. "Nathdale Fell" is the ridge between Naddle Vale (Nathdale</a>
<a id='line_4442'>Vale) and that of St. John, now known as High Rigg. The old Hall of</a>
<a id='line_4443'>Threlkeld has long been in a state of ruinous dilapidation, the only</a>
<a id='line_4444'>habitable part of it having been for many years converted into a</a>
<a id='line_4445'>farmhouse. The remaining local allusions in 'The Waggoner' are obvious</a>
<a id='line_4446'>enough: Castrigg is the shortened form of Castlerigg, the ridge between</a>

<a id='line_4449'>In the "Reminiscences" of Wordsworth, which the Hon. Mr. Justice</a>
<a id='line_4450'>Coleridge wrote for the late Bishop of Lincoln, in 1850, there is the</a>
<a id='line_4451'>following reference to 'The Waggoner'. (See 'Memoirs', vol. ii. p. 310.)</a>
<a id='line_4452'></a>
<a id='line_4453'>  "'The Waggoner' seems a very favourite poem of his. He said his object</a>
<a id='line_4454'>  in it had not been understood. It was a play of the fancy on a</a>
<a id='line_4455'>  domestic incident, and lowly character. He wished by the opening</a>
<a id='line_4456'>  descriptive lines to put his reader into the state of mind in which he</a>
<a id='line_4457'>  wished it to be read. If he failed in doing that, he wished him to lay</a>
<a id='line_4458'>  it down. He pointed out with the same view, the glowing lines on the</a>
<a id='line_4459'>  state of exultation in which Ben and his companions are under the</a>
<a id='line_4460'>  influence of liquor. Then he read the sickening languor of the morning</a>
<a id='line_4461'>  walk, contrasted with the glorious uprising of Nature, and the songs</a>
<a id='line_4462'>  of the birds. Here he has added about six most exquisite lines."</a>
<a id='line_4463'></a>
<a id='line_4464'>The lines referred to are doubtless the eight (p. 101), beginning</a>
<a id='line_4465'></a>
<a id='line_4466'>  'Say more; for by that power a vein,'</a>
<a id='line_4467'></a>
<a id='line_4468'>which were added in the edition of 1836.</a>
<a id='line_4469'></a>
<a id='line_4470'>The following is Sara Coleridge's criticism of 'The Waggoner'. (See</a>
<a id='line_4471'>'Biographia Literaria', vol. ii. pp. 183, 184, edition 1847.)</a>
<a id='line_4472'></a>
<a id='line_4473'>  "Due honour is done to 'Peter Bell', at this time, by students of</a>
<a id='line_4474'>  poetry in general; but some, even of Mr. Wordsworth's greatest</a>
<a id='line_4475'>  admirers, do not quite satisfy me in their admiration of 'The</a>
<a id='line_4476'>  Waggoner', a poem which my dear uncle, Mr. Southey, preferred even to</a>
<a id='line_4477'>  the former. 'Ich will meine Denkungs Art hierin niemandem aufdringen',</a>
<a id='line_4478'>  as Lessing says: I will force my way of thinking on nobody, but take</a>
<a id='line_4479'>  the liberty, for my own gratification, to express it. The sketches of</a>
<a id='line_4480'>  hill and valley in this poem have a lightness, and spirit--an Allegro</a>
<a id='line_4481'>  touch--distinguishing them from the grave and elevated splendour which</a>
<a id='line_4482'>  characterises Mr. Wordsworth's representations of Nature in general,</a>
<a id='line_4483'>  and from the passive tenderness of those in 'The White Doe', while it</a>
<a id='line_4484'>  harmonises well with the human interest of the piece; indeed it is the</a>
<a id='line_4485'>  harmonious sweetness of the composition which is most dwelt upon by</a>
<a id='line_4486'>  its special admirers. In its course it describes, with bold brief</a>
<a id='line_4487'>  touches, the striking mountain tract from Grasmere to Keswick; it</a>
<a id='line_4488'>  commences with an evening storm among the mountains, presents a lively</a>
<a id='line_4489'>  interior of a country inn during midnight, and concludes after</a>
<a id='line_4490'>  bringing us in sight of St. John's Vale and the Vale of Keswick seen</a>
<a id='line_4491'>  by day-break--'Skiddaw touched with rosy light,' and the prospect from</a>
<a id='line_4492'>  Nathdale Fell 'hoar with the frost-like dews of dawn:' thus giving a</a>
<a id='line_4493'>  beautiful and well-contrasted Panorama, produced by the most delicate</a>
<a id='line_4494'>  and masterly strokes of the pencil. Well may Mr. Ruskin, a fine</a>
<a id='line_4495'>  observer and eloquent describer of various classes of natural</a>
<a id='line_4496'>  appearances, speak of Mr. Wordsworth as the great poetic landscape</a>
<a id='line_4497'>  painter of the age. But Mr. Ruskin has found how seldom the great</a>
<a id='line_4498'>  landscape painters are powerful in expressing human passions and</a>
<a id='line_4499'>  affections on canvas, or even successful in the introduction of human</a>
<a id='line_4500'>  figures into their foregrounds; whereas in the poetic paintings of Mr.</a>
<a id='line_4501'>  Wordsworth the landscape is always subordinate to a higher interest;</a>
<a id='line_4502'>  certainly, in 'The Waggoner', the little sketch of human nature which</a>
<a id='line_4503'>  occupies, as it were, the front of that encircling background, the</a>
<a id='line_4504'>  picture of Benjamin and his temptations, his humble friends and the</a>
<a id='line_4505'>  mute companions of his way, has a character of its own, combining with</a>
<a id='line_4506'>  sportiveness a homely pathos, which must ever be delightful to some of</a>
<a id='line_4507'>  those who are thoroughly conversant with the spirit of Mr.</a>
<a id='line_4508'>  Wordsworth's poetry. It may be compared with the ale-house scene in</a>
<a id='line_4509'>  'Tam o'Shanter', parts of Voss's Luise, or Ovid's Baucis and Philemon;</a>
<a id='line_4510'>  though it differs from each of them as much as they differ from each</a>
<a id='line_4511'>  other. The Epilogue carries on the feeling of the piece very</a>
<a id='line_4512'>  beautifully."</a>
<a id='line_4513'></a>
<a id='line_4514'>The editor of Southey's 'Life and Correspondence'--his son, the Rev.</a>
<a id='line_4515'>Charles Cuthbert Southey--tells us, in a note to a letter from S.T.</a>
<a id='line_4516'>Coleridge to his father, that the Waggoner's name was Jackson; and that</a>
<a id='line_4517'>"all the circumstances of the poem are accurately correct." This</a>
<a id='line_4518'>Jackson, after retiring from active work as waggoner, became the tenant</a>
<a id='line_4519'>of Greta Hall, where first Coleridge, and afterwards Southey lived. The</a>
<a id='line_4520'>Hall was divided into two houses, one of which Jackson occupied, and the</a>
<a id='line_4521'>other of which he let to Coleridge, who speaks thus of him in the letter</a>
<a id='line_4522'>to Southey, dated Greta Hall, Keswick, April 13, 1801:</a>
<a id='line_4523'></a>
<a id='line_4524'>  "My landlord, who dwells next door, has a very respectable library,</a>
<a id='line_4525'>  which he has put with mine; histories, encyclopedias, and all the</a>
<a id='line_4526'>  modern poetry, etc. etc. etc. A more truly disinterested man I never</a>
<a id='line_4527'>  met with; severely frugal, yet almost carelessly generous; and yet he</a>
<a id='line_4528'>  got all his money as a common carrier, by hard labour, and by pennies</a>
<a id='line_4529'>  and pennies. He is one instance among many in this country of the</a>
<a id='line_4530'>  salutary effect of the love of knowledge--he was from a boy a lover of</a>
<a id='line_4531'>  learning."</a>

<a id='line_4535'></a>
<a id='line_4536'>Charles Lamb--to whom 'The Waggoner' was dedicated--wrote thus to</a>
<a id='line_4537'>Wordsworth on 7th June 1819:</a>
<a id='line_4538'></a>
<a id='line_4539'>  "My dear Wordsworth,--You cannot imagine how proud we are here of the</a>
<a id='line_4540'>  dedication. We read it twice for once that we do the poem. I mean all</a>
<a id='line_4541'>  through; yet 'Benjamin' is no common favourite; there is a spirit of</a>
<a id='line_4542'>  beautiful tolerance in it. It is as good as it was in 1806; and it</a>
<a id='line_4543'>  will be as good in 1829, if our dim eyes shall be awake to peruse it.</a>
<a id='line_4544'>  Methinks there is a kind of shadowing affinity between the subject of</a>
<a id='line_4545'>  the narrative and the subject of the dedication.</a>
<a id='line_4546'>   ...</a>
<a id='line_4547'>  "I do not know which I like best,--the prologue (the latter part</a>
<a id='line_4548'>  especially) to 'P. Bell,' or the epilogue to 'Benjamin.' Yes, I tell</a>
<a id='line_4549'>  stories; I do know I like the last best; and the 'Waggoner' altogether</a>

<a id='line_4560'>  "I think you will be pleased with Wordsworth's 'Waggoner', if it were</a>

<a id='line_4562'>  was my poor landlord Jackson, and the cause of his exchanging it for</a>
<a id='line_4563'>  the one-horse cart was just as is represented in the poem; nobody but</a>

<a id='line_4591'></a>
<a id='line_4592'>The following Poem was commenced in the beginning of the year 1799, and</a>
<a id='line_4593'>completed in the summer of 1805.</a>
<a id='line_4594'></a>
<a id='line_4595'>The design and occasion of the work are described by the Author in his</a>
<a id='line_4596'>Preface to the EXCURSION, first published in 1814, where he thus speaks:</a>
<a id='line_4597'></a>
<a id='line_4598'>  "Several years ago, when the Author retired to his native mountains</a>
<a id='line_4599'>  with the hope of being enabled to construct a literary work that might</a>
<a id='line_4600'>  live, it was a reasonable thing that he should take a review of his</a>
<a id='line_4601'>  own mind, and examine how far Nature and Education had qualified him</a>
<a id='line_4602'>  for such an employment.</a>
<a id='line_4603'></a>
<a id='line_4604'>  "As subsidiary to this preparation, he undertook to record, in verse,</a>
<a id='line_4605'>  the origin and progress of his own powers, as far as he was acquainted</a>
<a id='line_4606'>  with them.</a>
<a id='line_4607'></a>
<a id='line_4608'>  "That work, addressed to a dear friend, most distinguished for his</a>
<a id='line_4609'>  knowledge and genius, and to whom the author's intellect is deeply</a>
<a id='line_4610'>  indebted, has been long finished; and the result of the investigation</a>
<a id='line_4611'>  which gave rise to it, was a determination to compose a philosophical</a>
<a id='line_4612'>  Poem, containing views of Man, Nature, and Society, and to be entitled</a>
<a id='line_4613'>  'The Recluse;' as having for its principal subject the sensations and</a>
<a id='line_4614'>  opinions of a poet living in retirement.</a>
<a id='line_4615'></a>
<a id='line_4616'>  "The preparatory poem is biographical, and conducts the history of the</a>
<a id='line_4617'>  Author's mind to the point when he was emboldened to hope that his</a>
<a id='line_4618'>  faculties were sufficiently matured for entering upon the arduous</a>
<a id='line_4619'>  labour which he had proposed to himself; and the two works have the</a>
<a id='line_4620'>  same kind of relation to each other, if he may so express himself, as</a>
<a id='line_4621'>  the Ante-chapel has to the body of a Gothic Church. Continuing this</a>
<a id='line_4622'>  allusion, he may be permitted to add, that his minor pieces, which</a>
<a id='line_4623'>  have been long before the public, when they shall be properly</a>
<a id='line_4624'>  arranged, will be found by the attentive reader to have such</a>
<a id='line_4625'>  connection with the main work as may give them claim to be likened to</a>
<a id='line_4626'>  the little cells, oratories, and sepulchral recesses, ordinarily</a>
<a id='line_4627'>  included in those edifices."</a>
<a id='line_4628'></a>
<a id='line_4629'>Such was the Author's language in the year 1814.</a>
<a id='line_4630'></a>
<a id='line_4631'>It will thence be seen, that the present Poem was intended to be</a>
<a id='line_4632'>introductory to the RECLUSE, and that the RECLUSE, if completed, would</a>
<a id='line_4633'>have consisted of Three Parts. Of these, the Second Part alone, viz. the</a>
<a id='line_4634'>EXCURSION, was finished, and given to the world by the Author.</a>
<a id='line_4635'></a>
<a id='line_4636'>The First Book of the First Part of the RECLUSE still remains in</a>
<a id='line_4637'>manuscript; but the Third Part was only planned. The materials of which</a>
<a id='line_4638'>it would have been formed have, however, been incorporated, for the most</a>
<a id='line_4639'>part, in the Author's other Publications, written subsequently to the</a>
<a id='line_4640'>EXCURSION.</a>
<a id='line_4641'></a>
<a id='line_4642'>The Friend, to whom the present Poem is addressed, was the late SAMUEL</a>
<a id='line_4643'>TAYLOR COLERIDGE, who was resident in Malta, for the restoration of his</a>
<a id='line_4644'>health, when the greater part of it was composed.</a>
<a id='line_4645'></a>
<a id='line_4646'>Mr. Coleridge read a considerable portion of the Poem while he was</a>
<a id='line_4647'>abroad; and his feelings, on hearing it recited by the Author (after his</a>
<a id='line_4648'>return to his own country) are recorded in his Verses, addressed to Mr.</a>
<a id='line_4649'>Wordsworth, which will be found in the 'Sibylline Leaves,' p. 197,</a>
<a id='line_4650'>edition 1817, or 'Poetical Works, by S. T. Coleridge,' vol. i. p. 206.</a>

<a id='line_4652'>RYDAL MOUNT, _July 13th_, 1850.</a>
<a id='line_4653'></a>
<a id='line_4654'></a>
<a id='line_4655'>This "advertisement" to the first edition of 'The Prelude,' published in</a>
<a id='line_4656'>1850--the year of Wordsworth's death--was written by Mr. Carter, who</a>
<a id='line_4657'>edited the volume. Mr. Carter was for many years the poet's secretary,</a>
<a id='line_4658'>and afterwards one of his literary executors. The poem was not only kept</a>
<a id='line_4659'>back from publication during Wordsworth's life-time, but it remained</a>
<a id='line_4660'>without a title; being alluded to by himself, when he spoke or wrote of</a>
<a id='line_4661'>it, as "the poem on my own poetical education," the "poem on my own</a>
<a id='line_4662'>life," etc.</a>
<a id='line_4663'></a>
<a id='line_4664'>As 'The Prelude' is autobiographical, a large part of Wordsworth's life</a>
<a id='line_4665'>might be written in the notes appended to it; but, besides breaking up</a>
<a id='line_4666'>the text of the poem unduly, this plan has many disadvantages, and would</a>
<a id='line_4667'>render a subsequent and detailed life of the poet either unnecessary or</a>
<a id='line_4668'>repetitive. The notes which follow will therefore be limited to the</a>
<a id='line_4669'>explanation of local, historical, and chronological allusions, or to</a>
<a id='line_4670'>references to Wordsworth's own career that are not obvious without them.</a>
<a id='line_4671'>It has been occasionally difficult to decide whether some of the</a>
<a id='line_4672'>allusions, to minute points in ancient history, mediæval mythology, and</a>
<a id='line_4673'>contemporary politics, should be explained or left alone; but I have</a>
<a id='line_4674'>preferred to err on the side of giving a brief clue to details, with</a>
<a id='line_4675'>which every scholar is familiar.</a>
<a id='line_4676'></a>
<a id='line_4677'>'The Prelude' was begun as Wordsworth left the imperial city of Goslar,</a>
<a id='line_4678'>in Lower Saxony, where he spent part of the last winter of last century,</a>
<a id='line_4679'>and which he left on the 10th of February 1799. Only lines 1 to 45,</a>
<a id='line_4680'>however, were composed at that time; and the poem was continued at</a>
<a id='line_4681'>desultory intervals after the settlement at Grasmere, during 1800, and</a>
<a id='line_4682'>following years. Large portions of it were dictated to his devoted</a>
<a id='line_4683'>amanuenses as he walked, or sat, on the terraces of Lancrigg. Six books</a>
<a id='line_4684'>were finished by 1805.</a>
<a id='line_4685'></a>
<a id='line_4686'>  "The seventh was begun in the opening of that year; ... and the</a>
<a id='line_4687'>  remaining seven were written before the end of June 1805, when his</a>
<a id='line_4688'>  friend Coleridge was in the island of Malta, for the restoration of</a>
<a id='line_4689'>  his health."</a>
<a id='line_4690'></a>
<a id='line_4691'>(The late Bishop of Lincoln.)</a>
<a id='line_4692'></a>
<a id='line_4693'>There is no uncertainty as to the year in which the later books were</a>
<a id='line_4694'>written; but there is considerable difficulty in fixing the precise date</a>
<a id='line_4695'>of the earlier ones. Writing from Grasmere to his friend Francis</a>
<a id='line_4696'>Wrangham--the letter is undated--Wordsworth says,</a>
<a id='line_4697'></a>
<a id='line_4698'>  "I am engaged in writing a poem on my own earlier life, which will</a>
<a id='line_4699'>  take five parts or books to complete, three of which are nearly</a>
<a id='line_4700'>  finished."</a>
<a id='line_4701'></a>
<a id='line_4702'>The late Bishop of Lincoln supposed that this letter to Wrangham was</a>
<a id='line_4703'>written "at the close of 1803, or beginning of 1804." (See 'Memoirs of</a>
<a id='line_4704'>Wordsworth,' vol. i. p. 303.) There is evidence that it belongs to 1804.</a>
<a id='line_4705'>At the commencement of the seventh book, p. 247, he says:</a>
<a id='line_4706'></a>
<a id='line_4707'>  _Six changeful years_ have vanished since I first</a>
<a id='line_4708'>  Poured out (saluted by that quickening breeze</a>
<a id='line_4709'>  Which met me issuing from the City's walls)</a>
<a id='line_4710'>  _A glad preamble to this Verse:_ I sang</a>
<a id='line_4711'>  Aloud, with fervour irresistible</a>
<a id='line_4712'>  Of short-lived transport, like a torrent bursting,</a>
<a id='line_4713'>  From a black thunder-cloud, down Scafell's side</a>
<a id='line_4714'>  To rush and disappear. But soon broke forth</a>
<a id='line_4715'>  (So willed the Muse) _a less impetuous stream,</a>
<a id='line_4716'>  That flowed awhile with unabating strength,</a>
<a id='line_4717'>  Then stopped for years; not audible again</a>
<a id='line_4718'>  Before last primrose-time._</a>
<a id='line_4719'></a>
<a id='line_4720'>I have _italicised_ the clauses which give some clue to the dates of</a>
<a id='line_4721'>composition. From these it would appear that the "glad preamble,"</a>
<a id='line_4722'>written on leaving Goslar in 1799 (which, I think, included only the</a>
<a id='line_4723'>first two paragraphs of book first), was a "short-lived transport"; but</a>
<a id='line_4724'>that "soon" afterwards "a less impetuous stream" broke forth, which,</a>
<a id='line_4725'>after the settlement at Grasmere, "flowed awhile with unabating</a>
<a id='line_4726'>strength," and then "stopped for years." Now the above passage,</a>
<a id='line_4727'>recording these things, was written in 1805, and in the late autumn of</a>
<a id='line_4728'>that year; (as is evident from the reference which immediately follows</a>
<a id='line_4729'>to the "choir of redbreasts" and the approach of winter). We must</a>
<a id='line_4730'>therefore assign the flowing of the "less impetuous stream," to 1802; in</a>
<a id='line_4731'>order to leave room for the intervening "years," in which it ceased to</a>
<a id='line_4732'>flow, till it was audible again in the spring of 1804, "last</a>
<a id='line_4733'>primrose-time."</a>
<a id='line_4734'></a>
<a id='line_4735'>A second reference to date occurs in the sixth book, p. 224, entitled</a>
<a id='line_4736'>"Cambridge and the Alps," in which he says,</a>
<a id='line_4737'></a>
<a id='line_4738'>  _Four years and thirty, told, this very week,_</a>
<a id='line_4739'>  Have I been now a sojourner on earth.</a>
<a id='line_4740'></a>
<a id='line_4741'>This fixes definitely enough the date of the composition of _that_ part</a>
<a id='line_4742'>of the work, _viz._ April 1804, which corresponds exactly to the "last</a>
<a id='line_4743'>primrose-time" of the previous extract from the seventh book, in which</a>
<a id='line_4744'>he tells us that after its long silence, his Muse was heard again. So</a>
<a id='line_4745'>far Wordsworth's own allusions to the date of 'The Prelude.'</a>
<a id='line_4746'></a>
<a id='line_4747'>But there are others supplied by his own, and his sister's letters, and</a>
<a id='line_4748'>also by the Grasmere Journal. In the Dove Cottage household it was</a>
<a id='line_4749'>known, and talked of, as "the Poem to Coleridge;" and Dorothy records,</a>
<a id='line_4750'>on 11th January 1803, that her brother was working at it. On 13th</a>
<a id='line_4751'>February 1804, she writes to Mrs. Clarkson that her brother was engaged</a>
<a id='line_4752'>on a poem on his own life, and was "going on with great rapidity." On</a>
<a id='line_4753'>the 6th of March 1804, Wordsworth wrote from Grasmere to De Quincey,</a>
<a id='line_4754'></a>
<a id='line_4755'>  "I am now writing a poem on my own earlier life: I have just finished</a>
<a id='line_4756'>  that part of it in which I speak of my residence at the University."</a>
<a id='line_4757'>  ... It is "better than half complete, viz. four books, amounting to</a>
<a id='line_4758'>  about 2500 lines."[A]</a>
<a id='line_4759'></a>
<a id='line_4760'>On the 24th of March, Dorothy wrote to Mrs. Clarkson, that since</a>
<a id='line_4761'>Coleridge left them (which was in January 1804), her brother had added</a>
<a id='line_4762'>1500 lines to the poem on his own life. On the 29th of April 1804,</a>
<a id='line_4763'>Wordsworth wrote to Richard Sharpe,</a>
<a id='line_4764'></a>
<a id='line_4765'>  "I have been very busy these last ten weeks: having written between</a>
<a id='line_4766'>  two and three thousand lines--accurately near three thousand--in that</a>
<a id='line_4767'>  time; namely, four books, and a third of another. I am at present at</a>
<a id='line_4768'>  the Seventh Book."</a>
<a id='line_4769'></a>
<a id='line_4770'>On the 25th December 1804, he wrote to Sir George Beaumont,</a>
<a id='line_4771'></a>
<a id='line_4772'>  "I have written upwards of 2000 verses during the last ten weeks."</a>
<a id='line_4773'></a>
<a id='line_4774'>We thus find that Books I. to IV. had been written by the 6th of March</a>
<a id='line_4775'>1804, that from the 19th February to the 29th of April nearly 3000 lines</a>
<a id='line_4776'>were written, that March and April were specially productive months, for</a>
<a id='line_4777'>by the 29th April he had reached Book VII. while from 16th October to</a>
<a id='line_4778'>25th December he wrote over 2000 lines.</a>
<a id='line_4779'></a>
<a id='line_4780'>Dorothy and Mary Wordsworth transcribed the earlier books more than</a>
<a id='line_4781'>once, and a copy of some of them was given to Coleridge to take with him</a>
<a id='line_4782'>to Malta.</a>
<a id='line_4783'></a>
<a id='line_4784'>It is certain that the remaining books of 'The Prelude' were all written</a>
<a id='line_4785'>in the spring and early summer of 1805; the seventh, eighth, ninth,</a>
<a id='line_4786'>tenth, eleventh, and part of the twelfth being finished about the middle</a>
<a id='line_4787'>of April; the last 300 lines of book twelfth in the last week of April;</a>
<a id='line_4788'>and the two remaining books--the thirteenth and fourteenth--before the</a>
<a id='line_4789'>20th of May. The following extracts from letters of Wordsworth to Sir</a>
<a id='line_4790'>George Beaumont make this clear, and also cast light on matters much</a>
<a id='line_4791'>more important than the mere dates of composition.</a>

<a id='line_4794'></a>
<a id='line_4795'>  "My dear Sir George,--You will be pleased to hear that I have been</a>
<a id='line_4796'>  advancing with my work: I have written upwards of 2000 verses during</a>
<a id='line_4797'>  the last ten weeks. I do not know if you are exactly acquainted with</a>
<a id='line_4798'>  the plan of my poetical labour: It is twofold; first, a Poem, to be</a>
<a id='line_4799'>  called 'The Recluse;' in which it will be my object to express in</a>
<a id='line_4800'>  verse my most interesting feelings concerning man, nature, and</a>
<a id='line_4801'>  society; and next, a poem (in which I am at present chiefly engaged)</a>
<a id='line_4802'>  on _my earlier life, or the growth of my own mind,_ taken up upon a</a>
<a id='line_4803'>  large scale. This latter work I expect to have finished before the</a>
<a id='line_4804'>  month of May; and then I purpose to fall with all my might on the</a>
<a id='line_4805'>  former, which is the chief object upon which my thoughts have been</a>
<a id='line_4806'>  fixed these many years. Of this poem, that of 'The Pedlar,' which</a>
<a id='line_4807'>  Coleridge read to you, is part; and I may have written of it</a>
<a id='line_4808'>  altogether about 2000 lines. It will consist, I hope, of about ten or</a>
<a id='line_4809'>  twelve thousand."</a>

<a id='line_4814'>  "Unable to proceed with this work, [B] I turned my thoughts again to</a>
<a id='line_4815'>  the 'Poem on my own Life', and you will be glad to hear that I have</a>
<a id='line_4816'>  added 300 lines to it in the course of last week. Two books more will</a>
<a id='line_4817'>  conclude it. It will not be much less than 9000 lines,--not hundred</a>
<a id='line_4818'>  but thousand lines long,--an alarming length! and a thing</a>
<a id='line_4819'>  unprecedented in literary history that a man should talk so much about</a>
<a id='line_4820'>  himself. It is not self-conceit, as you will know well, that has</a>
<a id='line_4821'>  induced me to do this, but real humility. I began the work because I</a>
<a id='line_4822'>  was _unprepared_ to treat _any more arduous subject_, and _diffident</a>
<a id='line_4823'>  of my own powers_. Here, at least, I hoped that to a certain degree I</a>
<a id='line_4824'>  should be sure of succeeding, as I had nothing to do but describe what</a>
<a id='line_4825'>  I had felt and thought, and therefore could not easily be bewildered.</a>
<a id='line_4826'>  This might have been done in narrower compass by a man of more</a>
<a id='line_4827'>  address; but I have done my best. If, when the work shall be finished,</a>
<a id='line_4828'>  it appears to the judicious to have redundancies, they shall be lopped</a>
<a id='line_4829'>  off, if possible; but this is very difficult to do, when a man has</a>
<a id='line_4830'>  written with thought; and this defect, whenever I have suspected it or</a>
<a id='line_4831'>  found it to exist in any writings of mine, I have always found it</a>
<a id='line_4832'>  incurable. The fault lies too deep, and is in the first conception."</a>

<a id='line_4835'>  GRASMERE, June 3, 1805.</a>
<a id='line_4836'></a>
<a id='line_4837'>  "I have the pleasure to say that I _finished my poem_ about a</a>
<a id='line_4838'>  fortnight ago. I had looked forward to the day as a most happy one;</a>
<a id='line_4839'>  ... But it was not a happy day for me; I was dejected on many</a>
<a id='line_4840'>  accounts: when I looked back upon the performance, it seemed to have a</a>
<a id='line_4841'>  dead weight about it,--the reality so far short of the expectation. It</a>
<a id='line_4842'>  was the first long labour that I had finished; and the doubt whether I</a>
<a id='line_4843'>  should ever live to write 'The Recluse', and the sense which I had of</a>
<a id='line_4844'>  this poem being so far below what I seemed capable of executing,</a>
<a id='line_4845'>  depressed me much; above all, many heavy thoughts of my poor departed</a>
<a id='line_4846'>  brother hung upon me, the joy which I should have had in showing him</a>
<a id='line_4847'>  the manuscript, and a thousand other vain fancies and dreams. I have</a>
<a id='line_4848'>  spoken of this, because it was a state of feeling new to me, the</a>
<a id='line_4849'>  occasion being new. This work may be considered as a sort of _portico_</a>
<a id='line_4850'>  to 'The Recluse', part of the same building, which I hope to be able,</a>
<a id='line_4851'>  ere long, to begin with in earnest; and if I am permitted to bring it</a>
<a id='line_4852'>  to a conclusion, and to write, further, a narrative poem of the epic</a>
<a id='line_4853'>  kind, I shall consider the task of my life as over. I ought to add,</a>
<a id='line_4854'>  that I have the satisfaction of finding the present poem not quite of</a>
<a id='line_4855'>  so alarming a length as I apprehended."</a>
<a id='line_4856'></a>
<a id='line_4857'></a>
<a id='line_4858'>These letters explain the delay in the publication of 'The Prelude'.</a>
<a id='line_4859'>They show that what led Wordsworth to write so much about himself was</a>
<a id='line_4860'>not self-conceit, but self-diffidence. He felt unprepared as yet for the</a>
<a id='line_4861'>more arduous task he had set before himself. He saw its faults as</a>
<a id='line_4862'>clearly, or more clearly, than the critics who condemned him. He knew</a>
<a id='line_4863'>that its length was excessive. He tried to condense it; he kept it</a>
<a id='line_4864'>beside him unpublished, and occasionally revised it, with a view to</a>
<a id='line_4865'>condensation, in vain. The text received his final corrections in the</a>
<a id='line_4866'>year 1832.</a>
<a id='line_4867'></a>
<a id='line_4868'>Wordsworth's reluctance to publish these portions of his great poem,</a>
<a id='line_4869'>'The Recluse', other than 'The Excursion', during his lifetime, was a</a>
<a id='line_4870'>matter of surprise to his friends; to whom he, or the ladies of his</a>
<a id='line_4871'>household, had read portions of it. In the year 1819, Charles Lamb wrote</a>
<a id='line_4872'>to him,</a>
<a id='line_4873'></a>
<a id='line_4874'>  "If, as you say, 'The Waggoner', in some sort, came at my call, oh for</a>
<a id='line_4875'>  a potent voice to call forth 'The Recluse' from his profound</a>
<a id='line_4876'>  dormitory, where he sleeps forgetful of his foolish charge--the</a>
<a id='line_4877'>  world!"</a>
<a id='line_4878'></a>
<a id='line_4879'>('The Letters of Charles Lamb', edited by Alfred Ainger, vol. ii. p.</a>
<a id='line_4880'>26.)</a>
<a id='line_4881'></a>
<a id='line_4882'>The admission made in the letter of May 1st, 1805, is note-worthy:</a>
<a id='line_4883'></a>
<a id='line_4884'>  "This defect" (of redundancy) "whenever I have suspected it or found</a>
<a id='line_4885'>  it to exist in any writings of mine, _I have always found incurable.</a>
<a id='line_4886'>  The fault lies too deep, and is in the first conception_."</a>
<a id='line_4887'></a>
<a id='line_4888'>The actual result--in the Poem he had at length committed to</a>
<a id='line_4889'>writing--was so far inferior to the ideal he had tried to realise, that</a>
<a id='line_4890'>he could never be induced to publish it. He spoke of the MS. as forming</a>
<a id='line_4891'>a sort of _portico_ to his larger work--the poem on Man, Nature, and</a>
<a id='line_4892'>Society--which he meant to call 'The Recluse', and of which one portion</a>
<a id='line_4893'>only, _viz._ 'The Excursion', was finished. It is clear that throughout</a>
<a id='line_4894'>the composition of 'The Prelude', he felt that he was experimenting with</a>
<a id='line_4895'>his powers. He wished to find out whether he could construct "a literary</a>
<a id='line_4896'>work that might live," on a larger scale than his Lyrics; and it was on</a>
<a id='line_4897'>the writing of a "philosophical poem," dealing with Man and Nature, in</a>
<a id='line_4898'>their deepest aspects, that his thoughts had been fixed for many years.</a>
<a id='line_4899'>From the letter to Sir George Beaumont, December 25, 1804, it is evident</a>
<a id='line_4900'>that he regarded the autobiographical poem as a mere prologue to this</a>
<a id='line_4901'>larger work, to which he hoped to turn "with all his might" after 'The</a>
<a id='line_4902'>Prelude' was finished, and of which he had already written about a fifth</a>
<a id='line_4903'>or a sixth (see 'Memoirs', vol. i. p. 304). This was the part known in</a>
<a id='line_4904'>the Grasmere household as "The Pedlar," a title given to it from the</a>
<a id='line_4905'>character of the Wanderer, but afterwards happily set aside. He did not</a>
<a id='line_4906'>devote himself, however, to the completion of his wider purpose,</a>
<a id='line_4907'>immediately after 'The Prelude' was finished. He wrote one book of 'The</a>
<a id='line_4908'>Recluse' which he called "Home at Grasmere"; and, though detached from</a>
<a id='line_4909'>'The Prelude', it is a continuation of the narrative of his own life at</a>
<a id='line_4910'>the point where it is left off in the latter poem. It consists of 733</a>
<a id='line_4911'>lines. Two extracts from it were published in the 'Memoirs of</a>
<a id='line_4912'>Wordsworth' in 1851 (vol. i. pp. 151 and 155), beginning,</a>
<a id='line_4913'></a>
<a id='line_4914'>  'On Nature's invitation do I come,'</a>
<a id='line_4915'></a>
<a id='line_4916'>and</a>
<a id='line_4917'></a>
<a id='line_4918'>  'Bleak season was it, turbulent and bleak.'</a>
<a id='line_4919'></a>
<a id='line_4920'>These will be found in vol. ii. of this edition, pp. 118 and 121</a>
<a id='line_4921'>respectively.</a>
<a id='line_4922'></a>
<a id='line_4923'>The autobiographical poem remained, as already stated, during</a>
<a id='line_4924'>Wordsworth's lifetime without a title. The name finally adopted--'The</a>
<a id='line_4925'>Prelude'--was suggested by Mrs. Wordsworth, both to indicate its</a>
<a id='line_4926'>relation to the larger work, and the fact of its having been written</a>
<a id='line_4927'>comparatively early.</a>
<a id='line_4928'></a>
<a id='line_4929'>As the poem was addressed to Coleridge, it may be desirable to add in</a>
<a id='line_4930'>this place his critical verdict upon it; along with the poem which he</a>
<a id='line_4931'>wrote, on hearing Wordsworth read a portion of it to him, in the winter</a>
<a id='line_4932'>of 1806, at Coleorton.</a>
<a id='line_4933'></a>
<a id='line_4934'>In his 'Table Talk' (London, 1835, vol. ii. p. 70), Coleridge's opinion</a>
<a id='line_4935'>is recorded thus:</a>
<a id='line_4936'></a>
<a id='line_4937'>  "I cannot help regretting that Wordsworth did not first publish his</a>
<a id='line_4938'>  thirteen (fourteen) books on the growth of an individual</a>
<a id='line_4939'>  mind--superior, as I used to think, upon the whole to 'The Excursion'.</a>
<a id='line_4940'>  You may judge how I felt about them by my own Poem upon the occasion.</a>
<a id='line_4941'>  Then the plan laid out, and, I believe, partly suggested by me, was,</a>
<a id='line_4942'>  that Wordsworth should assume the station of a man in mental repose,</a>
<a id='line_4943'>  one whose principles were made up, and so prepared to deliver upon</a>
<a id='line_4944'>  authority a system of philosophy. He was to treat man as man,--a</a>
<a id='line_4945'>  subject of eye, ear, touch, and taste in contact with external nature,</a>
<a id='line_4946'>  and informing the senses from the mind, and not compounding a mind out</a>
<a id='line_4947'>  of the senses; then he was to describe the pastoral and other states</a>
<a id='line_4948'>  of society, assuming something of the Juvenalian spirit as he</a>
<a id='line_4949'>  approached the high civilisation of cities and towns, and opening a</a>
<a id='line_4950'>  melancholy picture of the present state of degeneracy and vice; thence</a>
<a id='line_4951'>  he was to infer and reveal the proof of, and necessity for, the whole</a>
<a id='line_4952'>  state of man and society being subject to, and illustrative of a</a>
<a id='line_4953'>  redemptive process in operation, showing how this idea reconciled all</a>
<a id='line_4954'>  the anomalies, and promised future glory and restoration. Something of</a>
<a id='line_4955'>  this sort was, I think, agreed on. It is, in substance, what I have</a>
<a id='line_4956'>  been all my life doing in my system of philosophy.</a>
<a id='line_4957'></a>
<a id='line_4958'>  "I think Wordsworth possessed more of the genius of a great</a>
<a id='line_4959'>  Philosopher than any man I ever knew, or, as I believe, has existed in</a>
<a id='line_4960'>  England since Milton; but it seems to me that he ought never to have</a>
<a id='line_4961'>  abandoned the contemplative position which is peculiarly--perhaps, I</a>
<a id='line_4962'>  might say exclusively--fitted for him. His proper title is 'Spectator</a>
<a id='line_4963'>  ab extra'."</a>

<a id='line_5033'>  Of Truth profound a sweet continuous lay,</a>
<a id='line_5034'>  Not learnt, but native, her own natural notes!</a>
<a id='line_5035'>  Ah! as I listened with a heart forlorn,</a>
<a id='line_5036'>  The pulses of my being beat anew:</a>
<a id='line_5037'>  And even as life returns upon the drowned,</a>
<a id='line_5038'>  Life's joy rekindling roused a throng of pains--</a>
<a id='line_5039'>  Keen pangs of Love, awakening as a babe</a>
<a id='line_5040'>  Turbulent, with an outcry in the heart;</a>
<a id='line_5041'>  And fears self-willed, that shunned the eye of hope;</a>
<a id='line_5042'>  And hope that scarce would know itself from fear;</a>
<a id='line_5043'>  Sense of past youth, and manhood come in vain,</a>
<a id='line_5044'>  And genius given, and knowledge won in vain;</a>
<a id='line_5045'>  And all which I had culled in wood-walks wild,</a>
<a id='line_5046'>  And all which patient toil had reared, and all,</a>
<a id='line_5047'>  Commune with thee had opened out--but flowers</a>
<a id='line_5048'>  Strewed on my corse, and borne upon my bier,</a>
<a id='line_5049'>  In the same coffin, for the self-same grave!</a>
<a id='line_5050'></a>
<a id='line_5051'>  ...   Eve following eve,</a>
<a id='line_5052'>  Dear tranquil time, when the sweet sense of Home</a>
<a id='line_5053'>  Is sweetest! moments for their own sake hailed,</a>
<a id='line_5054'>  And more desired, more precious for thy song,</a>
<a id='line_5055'>  In silence listening, like a devout child,</a>
<a id='line_5056'>  My soul lay passive, by thy various strain</a>
<a id='line_5057'>  Driven as in surges now beneath the stars,</a>
<a id='line_5058'>  With momentary stars of my own birth,</a>
<a id='line_5059'>  Fair constellated foam, [C] still darting off</a>
<a id='line_5060'>  Into the darkness; now a tranquil sea,</a>
<a id='line_5061'>  Outspread and bright, yet swelling to the moon.</a>
<a id='line_5062'></a>
<a id='line_5063'>    And when--O Friend! my comforter and guide!</a>
<a id='line_5064'>  Strong in thyself, and powerful to give strength!--</a>
<a id='line_5065'>  Thy long-sustained Song finally closed,</a>
<a id='line_5066'>  And thy deep voice had ceased--yet thou thyself</a>
<a id='line_5067'>  Wert still before my eyes, and round us both</a>
<a id='line_5068'>  That happy vision of beloved faces--</a>
<a id='line_5069'>  Scarce conscious, and yet conscious of its close</a>
<a id='line_5070'>  I sate, my being blended in one thought</a>
<a id='line_5071'>  (Thought was it? or aspiration? or resolve?)</a>
<a id='line_5072'>  Absorbed, yet hanging still upon the sound--</a>
<a id='line_5073'>  And when I rose I found myself in prayer.</a>
