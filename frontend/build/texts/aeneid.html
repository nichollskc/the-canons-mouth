<a id='line_3'>  THE AENEID</a>
<a id='line_4'></a>
<a id='line_5'>  by Virgil</a>
<a id='line_6'></a>
<a id='line_7'></a>
<a id='line_8'>  BOOK I</a>
<a id='line_9'></a>
<a id='line_10'>  Arms, and the man I sing, who, forc'd by fate,</a>
<a id='line_11'>  And haughty Juno's unrelenting hate,</a>
<a id='line_12'>  Expell'd and exil'd, left the Trojan shore.</a>
<a id='line_13'>  Long labors, both by sea and land, he bore,</a>
<a id='line_14'>  And in the doubtful war, before he won</a>
<a id='line_15'>  The Latian realm, and built the destin'd town;</a>
<a id='line_16'>  His banish'd gods restor'd to rites divine,</a>
<a id='line_17'>  And settled sure succession in his line,</a>
<a id='line_18'>  From whence the race of Alban fathers come,</a>
<a id='line_19'>  And the long glories of majestic Rome.</a>
<a id='line_20'></a>
<a id='line_21'>  O Muse! the causes and the crimes relate;</a>
<a id='line_22'>  What goddess was provok'd, and whence her hate;</a>
<a id='line_23'>  For what offense the Queen of Heav'n began</a>
<a id='line_24'>  To persecute so brave, so just a man;</a>
<a id='line_25'>  Involv'd his anxious life in endless cares,</a>
<a id='line_26'>  Expos'd to wants, and hurried into wars!</a>
<a id='line_27'>  Can heav'nly minds such high resentment show,</a>
<a id='line_28'>  Or exercise their spite in human woe?</a>
<a id='line_29'></a>
<a id='line_30'>  Against the Tiber's mouth, but far away,</a>
<a id='line_31'>  An ancient town was seated on the sea;</a>
<a id='line_32'>  A Tyrian colony; the people made</a>
<a id='line_33'>  Stout for the war, and studious of their trade:</a>
<a id='line_34'>  Carthage the name; belov'd by Juno more</a>
<a id='line_35'>  Than her own Argos, or the Samian shore.</a>
<a id='line_36'>  Here stood her chariot; here, if Heav'n were kind,</a>
<a id='line_37'>  The seat of awful empire she design'd.</a>
<a id='line_38'>  Yet she had heard an ancient rumor fly,</a>
<a id='line_39'>  (Long cited by the people of the sky,)</a>
<a id='line_40'>  That times to come should see the Trojan race</a>
<a id='line_41'>  Her Carthage ruin, and her tow'rs deface;</a>
<a id='line_42'>  Nor thus confin'd, the yoke of sov'reign sway</a>
<a id='line_43'>  Should on the necks of all the nations lay.</a>
<a id='line_44'>  She ponder'd this, and fear'd it was in fate;</a>
<a id='line_45'>  Nor could forget the war she wag'd of late</a>
<a id='line_46'>  For conqu'ring Greece against the Trojan state.</a>
<a id='line_47'>  Besides, long causes working in her mind,</a>
<a id='line_48'>  And secret seeds of envy, lay behind;</a>
<a id='line_49'>  Deep graven in her heart the doom remain'd</a>
<a id='line_50'>  Of partial Paris, and her form disdain'd;</a>
<a id='line_51'>  The grace bestow'd on ravish'd Ganymed,</a>
<a id='line_52'>  Electra's glories, and her injur'd bed.</a>
<a id='line_53'>  Each was a cause alone; and all combin'd</a>
<a id='line_54'>  To kindle vengeance in her haughty mind.</a>
<a id='line_55'>  For this, far distant from the Latian coast</a>
<a id='line_56'>  She drove the remnants of the Trojan host;</a>
<a id='line_57'>  And sev'n long years th' unhappy wand'ring train</a>
<a id='line_58'>  Were toss'd by storms, and scatter'd thro' the main.</a>
<a id='line_59'>  Such time, such toil, requir'd the Roman name,</a>
<a id='line_60'>  Such length of labor for so vast a frame.</a>
<a id='line_61'></a>
<a id='line_62'>  Now scarce the Trojan fleet, with sails and oars,</a>
<a id='line_63'>  Had left behind the fair Sicilian shores,</a>
<a id='line_64'>  Ent'ring with cheerful shouts the wat'ry reign,</a>
<a id='line_65'>  And plowing frothy furrows in the main;</a>
<a id='line_66'>  When, lab'ring still with endless discontent,</a>
<a id='line_67'>  The Queen of Heav'n did thus her fury vent:</a>
<a id='line_68'></a>
<a id='line_69'>  "Then am I vanquish'd? must I yield?" said she,</a>
<a id='line_70'>  "And must the Trojans reign in Italy?</a>
<a id='line_71'>  So Fate will have it, and Jove adds his force;</a>
<a id='line_72'>  Nor can my pow'r divert their happy course.</a>
<a id='line_73'>  Could angry Pallas, with revengeful spleen,</a>
<a id='line_74'>  The Grecian navy burn, and drown the men?</a>
<a id='line_75'>  She, for the fault of one offending foe,</a>
<a id='line_76'>  The bolts of Jove himself presum'd to throw:</a>
<a id='line_77'>  With whirlwinds from beneath she toss'd the ship,</a>
<a id='line_78'>  And bare expos'd the bosom of the deep;</a>
<a id='line_79'>  Then, as an eagle gripes the trembling game,</a>
<a id='line_80'>  The wretch, yet hissing with her father's flame,</a>
<a id='line_81'>  She strongly seiz'd, and with a burning wound</a>
<a id='line_82'>  Transfix'd, and naked, on a rock she bound.</a>
<a id='line_83'>  But I, who walk in awful state above,</a>
<a id='line_84'>  The majesty of heav'n, the sister wife of Jove,</a>
<a id='line_85'>  For length of years my fruitless force employ</a>
<a id='line_86'>  Against the thin remains of ruin'd Troy!</a>
<a id='line_87'>  What nations now to Juno's pow'r will pray,</a>
<a id='line_88'>  Or off'rings on my slighted altars lay?"</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>  Thus rag'd the goddess; and, with fury fraught.</a>
<a id='line_91'>  The restless regions of the storms she sought,</a>
<a id='line_92'>  Where, in a spacious cave of living stone,</a>
<a id='line_93'>  The tyrant Aeolus, from his airy throne,</a>
<a id='line_94'>  With pow'r imperial curbs the struggling winds,</a>
<a id='line_95'>  And sounding tempests in dark prisons binds.</a>
<a id='line_96'>  This way and that th' impatient captives tend,</a>
<a id='line_97'>  And, pressing for release, the mountains rend.</a>
<a id='line_98'>  High in his hall th' undaunted monarch stands,</a>
<a id='line_99'>  And shakes his scepter, and their rage commands;</a>
<a id='line_100'>  Which did he not, their unresisted sway</a>
<a id='line_101'>  Would sweep the world before them in their way;</a>
<a id='line_102'>  Earth, air, and seas thro' empty space would roll,</a>
<a id='line_103'>  And heav'n would fly before the driving soul.</a>
<a id='line_104'>  In fear of this, the Father of the Gods</a>
<a id='line_105'>  Confin'd their fury to those dark abodes,</a>
<a id='line_106'>  And lock'd 'em safe within, oppress'd with mountain loads;</a>
<a id='line_107'>  Impos'd a king, with arbitrary sway,</a>
<a id='line_108'>  To loose their fetters, or their force allay.</a>
<a id='line_109'>  To whom the suppliant queen her pray'rs address'd,</a>
<a id='line_110'>  And thus the tenor of her suit express'd:</a>
<a id='line_111'></a>
<a id='line_112'>  "O Aeolus! for to thee the King of Heav'n</a>
<a id='line_113'>  The pow'r of tempests and of winds has giv'n;</a>
<a id='line_114'>  Thy force alone their fury can restrain,</a>
<a id='line_115'>  And smooth the waves, or swell the troubled main-</a>
<a id='line_116'>  A race of wand'ring slaves, abhorr'd by me,</a>
<a id='line_117'>  With prosp'rous passage cut the Tuscan sea;</a>
<a id='line_118'>  To fruitful Italy their course they steer,</a>
<a id='line_119'>  And for their vanquish'd gods design new temples there.</a>
<a id='line_120'>  Raise all thy winds; with night involve the skies;</a>
<a id='line_121'>  Sink or disperse my fatal enemies.</a>
<a id='line_122'>  Twice sev'n, the charming daughters of the main,</a>
<a id='line_123'>  Around my person wait, and bear my train:</a>
<a id='line_124'>  Succeed my wish, and second my design;</a>
<a id='line_125'>  The fairest, Deiopeia, shall be thine,</a>
<a id='line_126'>  And make thee father of a happy line."</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>  To this the god: "'T is yours, O queen, to will</a>
<a id='line_129'>  The work which duty binds me to fulfil.</a>
<a id='line_130'>  These airy kingdoms, and this wide command,</a>
<a id='line_131'>  Are all the presents of your bounteous hand:</a>
<a id='line_132'>  Yours is my sov'reign's grace; and, as your guest,</a>
<a id='line_133'>  I sit with gods at their celestial feast;</a>
<a id='line_134'>  Raise tempests at your pleasure, or subdue;</a>
<a id='line_135'>  Dispose of empire, which I hold from you."</a>
<a id='line_136'></a>
<a id='line_137'>  He said, and hurl'd against the mountain side</a>
<a id='line_138'>  His quiv'ring spear, and all the god applied.</a>
<a id='line_139'>  The raging winds rush thro' the hollow wound,</a>
<a id='line_140'>  And dance aloft in air, and skim along the ground;</a>
<a id='line_141'>  Then, settling on the sea, the surges sweep,</a>
<a id='line_142'>  Raise liquid mountains, and disclose the deep.</a>
<a id='line_143'>  South, East, and West with mix'd confusion roar,</a>
<a id='line_144'>  And roll the foaming billows to the shore.</a>
<a id='line_145'>  The cables crack; the sailors' fearful cries</a>
<a id='line_146'>  Ascend; and sable night involves the skies;</a>
<a id='line_147'>  And heav'n itself is ravish'd from their eyes.</a>
<a id='line_148'>  Loud peals of thunder from the poles ensue;</a>
<a id='line_149'>  Then flashing fires the transient light renew;</a>
<a id='line_150'>  The face of things a frightful image bears,</a>
<a id='line_151'>  And present death in various forms appears.</a>
<a id='line_152'>  Struck with unusual fright, the Trojan chief,</a>
<a id='line_153'>  With lifted hands and eyes, invokes relief;</a>
<a id='line_154'>  And, "Thrice and four times happy those," he cried,</a>
<a id='line_155'>  "That under Ilian walls before their parents died!</a>
<a id='line_156'>  Tydides, bravest of the Grecian train!</a>
<a id='line_157'>  Why could not I by that strong arm be slain,</a>
<a id='line_158'>  And lie by noble Hector on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_159'>  Or great Sarpedon, in those bloody fields</a>
<a id='line_160'>  Where Simois rolls the bodies and the shields</a>
<a id='line_161'>  Of heroes, whose dismember'd hands yet bear</a>
<a id='line_162'>  The dart aloft, and clench the pointed spear!"</a>
<a id='line_163'></a>
<a id='line_164'>  Thus while the pious prince his fate bewails,</a>
<a id='line_165'>  Fierce Boreas drove against his flying sails,</a>
<a id='line_166'>  And rent the sheets; the raging billows rise,</a>
<a id='line_167'>  And mount the tossing vessels to the skies:</a>
<a id='line_168'>  Nor can the shiv'ring oars sustain the blow;</a>
<a id='line_169'>  The galley gives her side, and turns her prow;</a>
<a id='line_170'>  While those astern, descending down the steep,</a>
<a id='line_171'>  Thro' gaping waves behold the boiling deep.</a>
<a id='line_172'>  Three ships were hurried by the southern blast,</a>
<a id='line_173'>  And on the secret shelves with fury cast.</a>
<a id='line_174'>  Those hidden rocks th' Ausonian sailors knew:</a>
<a id='line_175'>  They call'd them Altars, when they rose in view,</a>
<a id='line_176'>  And show'd their spacious backs above the flood.</a>
<a id='line_177'>  Three more fierce Eurus, in his angry mood,</a>
<a id='line_178'>  Dash'd on the shallows of the moving sand,</a>
<a id='line_179'>  And in mid ocean left them moor'd aland.</a>
<a id='line_180'>  Orontes' bark, that bore the Lycian crew,</a>
<a id='line_181'>  (A horrid sight!) ev'n in the hero's view,</a>
<a id='line_182'>  From stem to stern by waves was overborne:</a>
<a id='line_183'>  The trembling pilot, from his rudder torn,</a>
<a id='line_184'>  Was headlong hurl'd; thrice round the ship was toss'd,</a>
<a id='line_185'>  Then bulg'd at once, and in the deep was lost;</a>
<a id='line_186'>  And here and there above the waves were seen</a>
<a id='line_187'>  Arms, pictures, precious goods, and floating men.</a>
<a id='line_188'>  The stoutest vessel to the storm gave way,</a>
<a id='line_189'>  And suck'd thro' loosen'd planks the rushing sea.</a>
<a id='line_190'>  Ilioneus was her chief: Alethes old,</a>
<a id='line_191'>  Achates faithful, Abas young and bold,</a>
<a id='line_192'>  Endur'd not less; their ships, with gaping seams,</a>
<a id='line_193'>  Admit the deluge of the briny streams.</a>
<a id='line_194'></a>
<a id='line_195'>  Meantime imperial Neptune heard the sound</a>
<a id='line_196'>  Of raging billows breaking on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_197'>  Displeas'd, and fearing for his wat'ry reign,</a>
<a id='line_198'>  He rear'd his awful head above the main,</a>
<a id='line_199'>  Serene in majesty; then roll'd his eyes</a>
<a id='line_200'>  Around the space of earth, and seas, and skies.</a>
<a id='line_201'>  He saw the Trojan fleet dispers'd, distress'd,</a>
<a id='line_202'>  By stormy winds and wintry heav'n oppress'd.</a>
<a id='line_203'>  Full well the god his sister's envy knew,</a>
<a id='line_204'>  And what her aims and what her arts pursue.</a>
<a id='line_205'>  He summon'd Eurus and the western blast,</a>
<a id='line_206'>  And first an angry glance on both he cast;</a>
<a id='line_207'>  Then thus rebuk'd: "Audacious winds! from whence</a>
<a id='line_208'>  This bold attempt, this rebel insolence?</a>
<a id='line_209'>  Is it for you to ravage seas and land,</a>
<a id='line_210'>  Unauthoriz'd by my supreme command?</a>
<a id='line_211'>  To raise such mountains on the troubled main?</a>
<a id='line_212'>  Whom I- but first 't is fit the billows to restrain;</a>
<a id='line_213'>  And then you shall be taught obedience to my reign.</a>
<a id='line_214'>  Hence! to your lord my royal mandate bear-</a>
<a id='line_215'>  The realms of ocean and the fields of air</a>
<a id='line_216'>  Are mine, not his. By fatal lot to me</a>
<a id='line_217'>  The liquid empire fell, and trident of the sea.</a>
<a id='line_218'>  His pow'r to hollow caverns is confin'd:</a>
<a id='line_219'>  There let him reign, the jailer of the wind,</a>
<a id='line_220'>  With hoarse commands his breathing subjects call,</a>
<a id='line_221'>  And boast and bluster in his empty hall."</a>
<a id='line_222'>  He spoke; and, while he spoke, he smooth'd the sea,</a>
<a id='line_223'>  Dispell'd the darkness, and restor'd the day.</a>
<a id='line_224'>  Cymothoe, Triton, and the sea-green train</a>
<a id='line_225'>  Of beauteous nymphs, the daughters of the main,</a>
<a id='line_226'>  Clear from the rocks the vessels with their hands:</a>
<a id='line_227'>  The god himself with ready trident stands,</a>
<a id='line_228'>  And opes the deep, and spreads the moving sands;</a>
<a id='line_229'>  Then heaves them off the shoals. Where'er he guides</a>
<a id='line_230'>  His finny coursers and in triumph rides,</a>
<a id='line_231'>  The waves unruffle and the sea subsides.</a>
<a id='line_232'>  As, when in tumults rise th' ignoble crowd,</a>
<a id='line_233'>  Mad are their motions, and their tongues are loud;</a>
<a id='line_234'>  And stones and brands in rattling volleys fly,</a>
<a id='line_235'>  And all the rustic arms that fury can supply:</a>
<a id='line_236'>  If then some grave and pious man appear,</a>
<a id='line_237'>  They hush their noise, and lend a list'ning ear;</a>
<a id='line_238'>  He soothes with sober words their angry mood,</a>
<a id='line_239'>  And quenches their innate desire of blood:</a>
<a id='line_240'>  So, when the Father of the Flood appears,</a>
<a id='line_241'>  And o'er the seas his sov'reign trident rears,</a>
<a id='line_242'>  Their fury falls: he skims the liquid plains,</a>
<a id='line_243'>  High on his chariot, and, with loosen'd reins,</a>
<a id='line_244'>  Majestic moves along, and awful peace maintains.</a>
<a id='line_245'>  The weary Trojans ply their shatter'd oars</a>
<a id='line_246'>  To nearest land, and make the Libyan shores.</a>
<a id='line_247'></a>
<a id='line_248'>  Within a long recess there lies a bay:</a>
<a id='line_249'>  An island shades it from the rolling sea,</a>
<a id='line_250'>  And forms a port secure for ships to ride;</a>
<a id='line_251'>  Broke by the jutting land, on either side,</a>
<a id='line_252'>  In double streams the briny waters glide.</a>
<a id='line_253'>  Betwixt two rows of rocks a sylvan scene</a>
<a id='line_254'>  Appears above, and groves for ever green:</a>
<a id='line_255'>  A grot is form'd beneath, with mossy seats,</a>
<a id='line_256'>  To rest the Nereids, and exclude the heats.</a>
<a id='line_257'>  Down thro' the crannies of the living walls</a>
<a id='line_258'>  The crystal streams descend in murm'ring falls:</a>
<a id='line_259'>  No haulsers need to bind the vessels here,</a>
<a id='line_260'>  Nor bearded anchors; for no storms they fear.</a>
<a id='line_261'>  Sev'n ships within this happy harbor meet,</a>
<a id='line_262'>  The thin remainders of the scatter'd fleet.</a>
<a id='line_263'>  The Trojans, worn with toils, and spent with woes,</a>
<a id='line_264'>  Leap on the welcome land, and seek their wish'd repose.</a>
<a id='line_265'></a>
<a id='line_266'>  First, good Achates, with repeated strokes</a>
<a id='line_267'>  Of clashing flints, their hidden fire provokes:</a>
<a id='line_268'>  Short flame succeeds; a bed of wither'd leaves</a>
<a id='line_269'>  The dying sparkles in their fall receives:</a>
<a id='line_270'>  Caught into life, in fiery fumes they rise,</a>
<a id='line_271'>  And, fed with stronger food, invade the skies.</a>
<a id='line_272'>  The Trojans, dropping wet, or stand around</a>
<a id='line_273'>  The cheerful blaze, or lie along the ground:</a>
<a id='line_274'>  Some dry their corn, infected with the brine,</a>
<a id='line_275'>  Then grind with marbles, and prepare to dine.</a>
<a id='line_276'>  Aeneas climbs the mountain's airy brow,</a>
<a id='line_277'>  And takes a prospect of the seas below,</a>
<a id='line_278'>  If Capys thence, or Antheus he could spy,</a>
<a id='line_279'>  Or see the streamers of Caicus fly.</a>
<a id='line_280'>  No vessels were in view; but, on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_281'>  Three beamy stags command a lordly train</a>
<a id='line_282'>  Of branching heads: the more ignoble throng</a>
<a id='line_283'>  Attend their stately steps, and slowly graze along.</a>
<a id='line_284'>  He stood; and, while secure they fed below,</a>
<a id='line_285'>  He took the quiver and the trusty bow</a>
<a id='line_286'>  Achates us'd to bear: the leaders first</a>
<a id='line_287'>  He laid along, and then the vulgar pierc'd;</a>
<a id='line_288'>  Nor ceas'd his arrows, till the shady plain</a>
<a id='line_289'>  Sev'n mighty bodies with their blood distain.</a>
<a id='line_290'>  For the sev'n ships he made an equal share,</a>
<a id='line_291'>  And to the port return'd, triumphant from the war.</a>
<a id='line_292'>  The jars of gen'rous wine (Acestes' gift,</a>
<a id='line_293'>  When his Trinacrian shores the navy left)</a>
<a id='line_294'>  He set abroach, and for the feast prepar'd,</a>
<a id='line_295'>  In equal portions with the ven'son shar'd.</a>
<a id='line_296'>  Thus while he dealt it round, the pious chief</a>
<a id='line_297'>  With cheerful words allay'd the common grief:</a>
<a id='line_298'>  "Endure, and conquer! Jove will soon dispose</a>
<a id='line_299'>  To future good our past and present woes.</a>
<a id='line_300'>  With me, the rocks of Scylla you have tried;</a>
<a id='line_301'>  Th' inhuman Cyclops and his den defied.</a>
<a id='line_302'>  What greater ills hereafter can you bear?</a>
<a id='line_303'>  Resume your courage and dismiss your care,</a>
<a id='line_304'>  An hour will come, with pleasure to relate</a>
<a id='line_305'>  Your sorrows past, as benefits of Fate.</a>
<a id='line_306'>  Thro' various hazards and events, we move</a>
<a id='line_307'>  To Latium and the realms foredoom'd by Jove.</a>
<a id='line_308'>  Call'd to the seat (the promise of the skies)</a>
<a id='line_309'>  Where Trojan kingdoms once again may rise,</a>
<a id='line_310'>  Endure the hardships of your present state;</a>
<a id='line_311'>  Live, and reserve yourselves for better fate."</a>
<a id='line_312'></a>
<a id='line_313'>  These words he spoke, but spoke not from his heart;</a>
<a id='line_314'>  His outward smiles conceal'd his inward smart.</a>
<a id='line_315'>  The jolly crew, unmindful of the past,</a>
<a id='line_316'>  The quarry share, their plenteous dinner haste.</a>
<a id='line_317'>  Some strip the skin; some portion out the spoil;</a>
<a id='line_318'>  The limbs, yet trembling, in the caldrons boil;</a>
<a id='line_319'>  Some on the fire the reeking entrails broil.</a>
<a id='line_320'>  Stretch'd on the grassy turf, at ease they dine,</a>
<a id='line_321'>  Restore their strength with meat, and cheer their souls with</a>
<a id='line_322'>  wine.</a>
<a id='line_323'>  Their hunger thus appeas'd, their care attends</a>
<a id='line_324'>  The doubtful fortune of their absent friends:</a>
<a id='line_325'>  Alternate hopes and fears their minds possess,</a>
<a id='line_326'>  Whether to deem 'em dead, or in distress.</a>
<a id='line_327'>  Above the rest, Aeneas mourns the fate</a>
<a id='line_328'>  Of brave Orontes, and th' uncertain state</a>
<a id='line_329'>  Of Gyas, Lycus, and of Amycus.</a>
<a id='line_330'>  The day, but not their sorrows, ended thus.</a>
<a id='line_331'></a>
<a id='line_332'>  When, from aloft, almighty Jove surveys</a>
<a id='line_333'>  Earth, air, and shores, and navigable seas,</a>
<a id='line_334'>  At length on Libyan realms he fix'd his eyes-</a>
<a id='line_335'>  Whom, pond'ring thus on human miseries,</a>
<a id='line_336'>  When Venus saw, she with a lowly look,</a>
<a id='line_337'>  Not free from tears, her heav'nly sire bespoke:</a>
<a id='line_338'></a>
<a id='line_339'>  "O King of Gods and Men! whose awful hand</a>
<a id='line_340'>  Disperses thunder on the seas and land,</a>
<a id='line_341'>  Disposing all with absolute command;</a>
<a id='line_342'>  How could my pious son thy pow'r incense?</a>
<a id='line_343'>  Or what, alas! is vanish'd Troy's offense?</a>
<a id='line_344'>  Our hope of Italy not only lost,</a>
<a id='line_345'>  On various seas by various tempests toss'd,</a>
<a id='line_346'>  But shut from ev'ry shore, and barr'd from ev'ry coast.</a>
<a id='line_347'>  You promis'd once, a progeny divine</a>
<a id='line_348'>  Of Romans, rising from the Trojan line,</a>
<a id='line_349'>  In after times should hold the world in awe,</a>
<a id='line_350'>  And to the land and ocean give the law.</a>
<a id='line_351'>  How is your doom revers'd, which eas'd my care</a>
<a id='line_352'>  When Troy was ruin'd in that cruel war?</a>
<a id='line_353'>  Then fates to fates I could oppose; but now,</a>
<a id='line_354'>  When Fortune still pursues her former blow,</a>
<a id='line_355'>  What can I hope? What worse can still succeed?</a>
<a id='line_356'>  What end of labors has your will decreed?</a>
<a id='line_357'>  Antenor, from the midst of Grecian hosts,</a>
<a id='line_358'>  Could pass secure, and pierce th' Illyrian coasts,</a>
<a id='line_359'>  Where, rolling down the steep, Timavus raves</a>
<a id='line_360'>  And thro' nine channels disembogues his waves.</a>
<a id='line_361'>  At length he founded Padua's happy seat,</a>
<a id='line_362'>  And gave his Trojans a secure retreat;</a>
<a id='line_363'>  There fix'd their arms, and there renew'd their name,</a>
<a id='line_364'>  And there in quiet rules, and crown'd with fame.</a>
<a id='line_365'>  But we, descended from your sacred line,</a>
<a id='line_366'>  Entitled to your heav'n and rites divine,</a>
<a id='line_367'>  Are banish'd earth; and, for the wrath of one,</a>
<a id='line_368'>  Remov'd from Latium and the promis'd throne.</a>
<a id='line_369'>  Are these our scepters? these our due rewards?</a>
<a id='line_370'>  And is it thus that Jove his plighted faith regards?"</a>
<a id='line_371'></a>
<a id='line_372'>  To whom the Father of th' immortal race,</a>
<a id='line_373'>  Smiling with that serene indulgent face,</a>
<a id='line_374'>  With which he drives the clouds and clears the skies,</a>
<a id='line_375'>  First gave a holy kiss; then thus replies:</a>
<a id='line_376'></a>
<a id='line_377'>  "Daughter, dismiss thy fears; to thy desire</a>
<a id='line_378'>  The fates of thine are fix'd, and stand entire.</a>
<a id='line_379'>  Thou shalt behold thy wish'd Lavinian walls;</a>
<a id='line_380'>  And, ripe for heav'n, when fate Aeneas calls,</a>
<a id='line_381'>  Then shalt thou bear him up, sublime, to me:</a>
<a id='line_382'>  No councils have revers'd my firm decree.</a>
<a id='line_383'>  And, lest new fears disturb thy happy state,</a>
<a id='line_384'>  Know, I have search'd the mystic rolls of Fate:</a>
<a id='line_385'>  Thy son (nor is th' appointed season far)</a>
<a id='line_386'>  In Italy shall wage successful war,</a>
<a id='line_387'>  Shall tame fierce nations in the bloody field,</a>
<a id='line_388'>  And sov'reign laws impose, and cities build,</a>
<a id='line_389'>  Till, after ev'ry foe subdued, the sun</a>
<a id='line_390'>  Thrice thro' the signs his annual race shall run:</a>
<a id='line_391'>  This is his time prefix'd. Ascanius then,</a>
<a id='line_392'>  Now call'd Iulus, shall begin his reign.</a>
<a id='line_393'>  He thirty rolling years the crown shall wear,</a>
<a id='line_394'>  Then from Lavinium shall the seat transfer,</a>
<a id='line_395'>  And, with hard labor, Alba Longa build.</a>
<a id='line_396'>  The throne with his succession shall be fill'd</a>
<a id='line_397'>  Three hundred circuits more: then shall be seen</a>
<a id='line_398'>  Ilia the fair, a priestess and a queen,</a>
<a id='line_399'>  Who, full of Mars, in time, with kindly throes,</a>
<a id='line_400'>  Shall at a birth two goodly boys disclose.</a>
<a id='line_401'>  The royal babes a tawny wolf shall drain:</a>
<a id='line_402'>  Then Romulus his grandsire's throne shall gain,</a>
<a id='line_403'>  Of martial tow'rs the founder shall become,</a>
<a id='line_404'>  The people Romans call, the city Rome.</a>
<a id='line_405'>  To them no bounds of empire I assign,</a>
<a id='line_406'>  Nor term of years to their immortal line.</a>
<a id='line_407'>  Ev'n haughty Juno, who, with endless broils,</a>
<a id='line_408'>  Earth, seas, and heav'n, and Jove himself turmoils;</a>
<a id='line_409'>  At length aton'd, her friendly pow'r shall join,</a>
<a id='line_410'>  To cherish and advance the Trojan line.</a>
<a id='line_411'>  The subject world shall Rome's dominion own,</a>
<a id='line_412'>  And, prostrate, shall adore the nation of the gown.</a>
<a id='line_413'>  An age is ripening in revolving fate</a>
<a id='line_414'>  When Troy shall overturn the Grecian state,</a>
<a id='line_415'>  And sweet revenge her conqu'ring sons shall call,</a>
<a id='line_416'>  To crush the people that conspir'd her fall.</a>
<a id='line_417'>  Then Caesar from the Julian stock shall rise,</a>
<a id='line_418'>  Whose empire ocean, and whose fame the skies</a>
<a id='line_419'>  Alone shall bound; whom, fraught with eastern spoils,</a>
<a id='line_420'>  Our heav'n, the just reward of human toils,</a>
<a id='line_421'>  Securely shall repay with rites divine;</a>
<a id='line_422'>  And incense shall ascend before his sacred shrine.</a>
<a id='line_423'>  Then dire debate and impious war shall cease,</a>
<a id='line_424'>  And the stern age be soften'd into peace:</a>
<a id='line_425'>  Then banish'd Faith shall once again return,</a>
<a id='line_426'>  And Vestal fires in hallow'd temples burn;</a>
<a id='line_427'>  And Remus with Quirinus shall sustain</a>
<a id='line_428'>  The righteous laws, and fraud and force restrain.</a>
<a id='line_429'>  Janus himself before his fane shall wait,</a>
<a id='line_430'>  And keep the dreadful issues of his gate,</a>
<a id='line_431'>  With bolts and iron bars: within remains</a>
<a id='line_432'>  Imprison'd Fury, bound in brazen chains;</a>
<a id='line_433'>  High on a trophy rais'd, of useless arms,</a>
<a id='line_434'>  He sits, and threats the world with vain alarms."</a>
<a id='line_435'></a>
<a id='line_436'>  He said, and sent Cyllenius with command</a>
<a id='line_437'>  To free the ports, and ope the Punic land</a>
<a id='line_438'>  To Trojan guests; lest, ignorant of fate,</a>
<a id='line_439'>  The queen might force them from her town and state.</a>
<a id='line_440'>  Down from the steep of heav'n Cyllenius flies,</a>
<a id='line_441'>  And cleaves with all his wings the yielding skies.</a>
<a id='line_442'>  Soon on the Libyan shore descends the god,</a>
<a id='line_443'>  Performs his message, and displays his rod:</a>
<a id='line_444'>  The surly murmurs of the people cease;</a>
<a id='line_445'>  And, as the fates requir'd, they give the peace:</a>
<a id='line_446'>  The queen herself suspends the rigid laws,</a>
<a id='line_447'>  The Trojans pities, and protects their cause.</a>
<a id='line_448'></a>
<a id='line_449'>  Meantime, in shades of night Aeneas lies:</a>
<a id='line_450'>  Care seiz'd his soul, and sleep forsook his eyes.</a>
<a id='line_451'>  But, when the sun restor'd the cheerful day,</a>
<a id='line_452'>  He rose, the coast and country to survey,</a>
<a id='line_453'>  Anxious and eager to discover more.</a>
<a id='line_454'>  It look'd a wild uncultivated shore;</a>
<a id='line_455'>  But, whether humankind, or beasts alone</a>
<a id='line_456'>  Possess'd the new-found region, was unknown.</a>
<a id='line_457'>  Beneath a ledge of rocks his fleet he hides:</a>
<a id='line_458'>  Tall trees surround the mountain's shady sides;</a>
<a id='line_459'>  The bending brow above a safe retreat provides.</a>
<a id='line_460'>  Arm'd with two pointed darts, he leaves his friends,</a>
<a id='line_461'>  And true Achates on his steps attends.</a>
<a id='line_462'>  Lo! in the deep recesses of the wood,</a>
<a id='line_463'>  Before his eyes his goddess mother stood:</a>
<a id='line_464'>  A huntress in her habit and her mien;</a>
<a id='line_465'>  Her dress a maid, her air confess'd a queen.</a>
<a id='line_466'>  Bare were her knees, and knots her garments bind;</a>
<a id='line_467'>  Loose was her hair, and wanton'd in the wind;</a>
<a id='line_468'>  Her hand sustain'd a bow; her quiver hung behind.</a>
<a id='line_469'>  She seem'd a virgin of the Spartan blood:</a>
<a id='line_470'>  With such array Harpalyce bestrode</a>
<a id='line_471'>  Her Thracian courser and outstripp'd the rapid flood.</a>
<a id='line_472'>  "Ho, strangers! have you lately seen," she said,</a>
<a id='line_473'>  "One of my sisters, like myself array'd,</a>
<a id='line_474'>  Who cross'd the lawn, or in the forest stray'd?</a>
<a id='line_475'>  A painted quiver at her back she bore;</a>
<a id='line_476'>  Varied with spots, a lynx's hide she wore;</a>
<a id='line_477'>  And at full cry pursued the tusky boar."</a>
<a id='line_478'></a>
<a id='line_479'>  Thus Venus: thus her son replied again:</a>
<a id='line_480'>  "None of your sisters have we heard or seen,</a>
<a id='line_481'>  O virgin! or what other name you bear</a>
<a id='line_482'>  Above that style- O more than mortal fair!</a>
<a id='line_483'>  Your voice and mien celestial birth betray!</a>
<a id='line_484'>  If, as you seem, the sister of the day,</a>
<a id='line_485'>  Or one at least of chaste Diana's train,</a>
<a id='line_486'>  Let not an humble suppliant sue in vain;</a>
<a id='line_487'>  But tell a stranger, long in tempests toss'd,</a>
<a id='line_488'>  What earth we tread, and who commands the coast?</a>
<a id='line_489'>  Then on your name shall wretched mortals call,</a>
<a id='line_490'>  And offer'd victims at your altars fall."</a>
<a id='line_491'>  "I dare not," she replied, "assume the name</a>
<a id='line_492'>  Of goddess, or celestial honors claim:</a>
<a id='line_493'>  For Tyrian virgins bows and quivers bear,</a>
<a id='line_494'>  And purple buskins o'er their ankles wear.</a>
<a id='line_495'>  Know, gentle youth, in Libyan lands you are-</a>
<a id='line_496'>  A people rude in peace, and rough in war.</a>
<a id='line_497'>  The rising city, which from far you see,</a>
<a id='line_498'>  Is Carthage, and a Tyrian colony.</a>
<a id='line_499'>  Phoenician Dido rules the growing state,</a>
<a id='line_500'>  Who fled from Tyre, to shun her brother's hate.</a>
<a id='line_501'>  Great were her wrongs, her story full of fate;</a>
<a id='line_502'>  Which I will sum in short. Sichaeus, known</a>
<a id='line_503'>  For wealth, and brother to the Punic throne,</a>
<a id='line_504'>  Possess'd fair Dido's bed; and either heart</a>
<a id='line_505'>  At once was wounded with an equal dart.</a>
<a id='line_506'>  Her father gave her, yet a spotless maid;</a>
<a id='line_507'>  Pygmalion then the Tyrian scepter sway'd:</a>
<a id='line_508'>  One who condemn'd divine and human laws.</a>
<a id='line_509'>  Then strife ensued, and cursed gold the cause.</a>
<a id='line_510'>  The monarch, blinded with desire of wealth,</a>
<a id='line_511'>  With steel invades his brother's life by stealth;</a>
<a id='line_512'>  Before the sacred altar made him bleed,</a>
<a id='line_513'>  And long from her conceal'd the cruel deed.</a>
<a id='line_514'>  Some tale, some new pretense, he daily coin'd,</a>
<a id='line_515'>  To soothe his sister, and delude her mind.</a>
<a id='line_516'>  At length, in dead of night, the ghost appears</a>
<a id='line_517'>  Of her unhappy lord: the specter stares,</a>
<a id='line_518'>  And, with erected eyes, his bloody bosom bares.</a>
<a id='line_519'>  The cruel altars and his fate he tells,</a>
<a id='line_520'>  And the dire secret of his house reveals,</a>
<a id='line_521'>  Then warns the widow, with her household gods,</a>
<a id='line_522'>  To seek a refuge in remote abodes.</a>
<a id='line_523'>  Last, to support her in so long a way,</a>
<a id='line_524'>  He shows her where his hidden treasure lay.</a>
<a id='line_525'>  Admonish'd thus, and seiz'd with mortal fright,</a>
<a id='line_526'>  The queen provides companions of her flight:</a>
<a id='line_527'>  They meet, and all combine to leave the state,</a>
<a id='line_528'>  Who hate the tyrant, or who fear his hate.</a>
<a id='line_529'>  They seize a fleet, which ready rigg'd they find;</a>
<a id='line_530'>  Nor is Pygmalion's treasure left behind.</a>
<a id='line_531'>  The vessels, heavy laden, put to sea</a>
<a id='line_532'>  With prosp'rous winds; a woman leads the way.</a>
<a id='line_533'>  I know not, if by stress of weather driv'n,</a>
<a id='line_534'>  Or was their fatal course dispos'd by Heav'n;</a>
<a id='line_535'>  At last they landed, where from far your eyes</a>
<a id='line_536'>  May view the turrets of new Carthage rise;</a>
<a id='line_537'>  There bought a space of ground, which (Byrsa call'd,</a>
<a id='line_538'>  From the bull's hide) they first inclos'd, and wall'd.</a>
<a id='line_539'>  But whence are you? what country claims your birth?</a>
<a id='line_540'>  What seek you, strangers, on our Libyan earth?"</a>
<a id='line_541'></a>
<a id='line_542'>  To whom, with sorrow streaming from his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_543'>  And deeply sighing, thus her son replies:</a>
<a id='line_544'>  "Could you with patience hear, or I relate,</a>
<a id='line_545'>  O nymph, the tedious annals of our fate!</a>
<a id='line_546'>  Thro' such a train of woes if I should run,</a>
<a id='line_547'>  The day would sooner than the tale be done!</a>
<a id='line_548'>  From ancient Troy, by force expell'd, we came-</a>
<a id='line_549'>  If you by chance have heard the Trojan name.</a>
<a id='line_550'>  On various seas by various tempests toss'd,</a>
<a id='line_551'>  At length we landed on your Libyan coast.</a>
<a id='line_552'>  The good Aeneas am I call'd- a name,</a>
<a id='line_553'>  While Fortune favor'd, not unknown to fame.</a>
<a id='line_554'>  My household gods, companions of my woes,</a>
<a id='line_555'>  With pious care I rescued from our foes.</a>
<a id='line_556'>  To fruitful Italy my course was bent;</a>
<a id='line_557'>  And from the King of Heav'n is my descent.</a>
<a id='line_558'>  With twice ten sail I cross'd the Phrygian sea;</a>
<a id='line_559'>  Fate and my mother goddess led my way.</a>
<a id='line_560'>  Scarce sev'n, the thin remainders of my fleet,</a>
<a id='line_561'>  From storms preserv'd, within your harbor meet.</a>
<a id='line_562'>  Myself distress'd, an exile, and unknown,</a>
<a id='line_563'>  Debarr'd from Europe, and from Asia thrown,</a>
<a id='line_564'>  In Libyan desarts wander thus alone."</a>
<a id='line_565'></a>
<a id='line_566'>  His tender parent could no longer bear;</a>
<a id='line_567'>  But, interposing, sought to soothe his care.</a>
<a id='line_568'>  "Whoe'er you are- not unbelov'd by Heav'n,</a>
<a id='line_569'>  Since on our friendly shore your ships are driv'n-</a>
<a id='line_570'>  Have courage: to the gods permit the rest,</a>
<a id='line_571'>  And to the queen expose your just request.</a>
<a id='line_572'>  Now take this earnest of success, for more:</a>
<a id='line_573'>  Your scatter'd fleet is join'd upon the shore;</a>
<a id='line_574'>  The winds are chang'd, your friends from danger free;</a>
<a id='line_575'>  Or I renounce my skill in augury.</a>
<a id='line_576'>  Twelve swans behold in beauteous order move,</a>
<a id='line_577'>  And stoop with closing pinions from above;</a>
<a id='line_578'>  Whom late the bird of Jove had driv'n along,</a>
<a id='line_579'>  And thro' the clouds pursued the scatt'ring throng:</a>
<a id='line_580'>  Now, all united in a goodly team,</a>
<a id='line_581'>  They skim the ground, and seek the quiet stream.</a>
<a id='line_582'>  As they, with joy returning, clap their wings,</a>
<a id='line_583'>  And ride the circuit of the skies in rings;</a>
<a id='line_584'>  Not otherwise your ships, and ev'ry friend,</a>
<a id='line_585'>  Already hold the port, or with swift sails descend.</a>
<a id='line_586'>  No more advice is needful; but pursue</a>
<a id='line_587'>  The path before you, and the town in view."</a>
<a id='line_588'></a>
<a id='line_589'>  Thus having said, she turn'd, and made appear</a>
<a id='line_590'>  Her neck refulgent, and dishevel'd hair,</a>
<a id='line_591'>  Which, flowing from her shoulders, reach'd the ground.</a>
<a id='line_592'>  And widely spread ambrosial scents around:</a>
<a id='line_593'>  In length of train descends her sweeping gown;</a>
<a id='line_594'>  And, by her graceful walk, the Queen of Love is known.</a>
<a id='line_595'>  The prince pursued the parting deity</a>
<a id='line_596'>  With words like these: "Ah! whither do you fly?</a>
<a id='line_597'>  Unkind and cruel! to deceive your son</a>
<a id='line_598'>  In borrow'd shapes, and his embrace to shun;</a>
<a id='line_599'>  Never to bless my sight, but thus unknown;</a>
<a id='line_600'>  And still to speak in accents not your own."</a>
<a id='line_601'>  Against the goddess these complaints he made,</a>
<a id='line_602'>  But took the path, and her commands obey'd.</a>
<a id='line_603'>  They march, obscure; for Venus kindly shrouds</a>
<a id='line_604'>  With mists their persons, and involves in clouds,</a>
<a id='line_605'>  That, thus unseen, their passage none might stay,</a>
<a id='line_606'>  Or force to tell the causes of their way.</a>
<a id='line_607'>  This part perform'd, the goddess flies sublime</a>
<a id='line_608'>  To visit Paphos and her native clime;</a>
<a id='line_609'>  Where garlands, ever green and ever fair,</a>
<a id='line_610'>  With vows are offer'd, and with solemn pray'r:</a>
<a id='line_611'>  A hundred altars in her temple smoke;</a>
<a id='line_612'>  A thousand bleeding hearts her pow'r invoke.</a>
<a id='line_613'></a>
<a id='line_614'>  They climb the next ascent, and, looking down,</a>
<a id='line_615'>  Now at a nearer distance view the town.</a>
<a id='line_616'>  The prince with wonder sees the stately tow'rs,</a>
<a id='line_617'>  Which late were huts and shepherds' homely bow'rs,</a>
<a id='line_618'>  The gates and streets; and hears, from ev'ry part,</a>
<a id='line_619'>  The noise and busy concourse of the mart.</a>
<a id='line_620'>  The toiling Tyrians on each other call</a>
<a id='line_621'>  To ply their labor: some extend the wall;</a>
<a id='line_622'>  Some build the citadel; the brawny throng</a>
<a id='line_623'>  Or dig, or push unwieldly stones along.</a>
<a id='line_624'>  Some for their dwellings choose a spot of ground,</a>
<a id='line_625'>  Which, first design'd, with ditches they surround.</a>
<a id='line_626'>  Some laws ordain; and some attend the choice</a>
<a id='line_627'>  Of holy senates, and elect by voice.</a>
<a id='line_628'>  Here some design a mole, while others there</a>
<a id='line_629'>  Lay deep foundations for a theater;</a>
<a id='line_630'>  From marble quarries mighty columns hew,</a>
<a id='line_631'>  For ornaments of scenes, and future view.</a>
<a id='line_632'>  Such is their toil, and such their busy pains,</a>
<a id='line_633'>  As exercise the bees in flow'ry plains,</a>
<a id='line_634'>  When winter past, and summer scarce begun,</a>
<a id='line_635'>  Invites them forth to labor in the sun;</a>
<a id='line_636'>  Some lead their youth abroad, while some condense</a>
<a id='line_637'>  Their liquid store, and some in cells dispense;</a>
<a id='line_638'>  Some at the gate stand ready to receive</a>
<a id='line_639'>  The golden burthen, and their friends relieve;</a>
<a id='line_640'>  All with united force, combine to drive</a>
<a id='line_641'>  The lazy drones from the laborious hive:</a>
<a id='line_642'>  With envy stung, they view each other's deeds;</a>
<a id='line_643'>  The fragrant work with diligence proceeds.</a>
<a id='line_644'>  "Thrice happy you, whose walls already rise!"</a>
<a id='line_645'>  Aeneas said, and view'd, with lifted eyes,</a>
<a id='line_646'>  Their lofty tow'rs; then, entiring at the gate,</a>
<a id='line_647'>  Conceal'd in clouds (prodigious to relate)</a>
<a id='line_648'>  He mix'd, unmark'd, among the busy throng,</a>
<a id='line_649'>  Borne by the tide, and pass'd unseen along.</a>
<a id='line_650'></a>
<a id='line_651'>  Full in the center of the town there stood,</a>
<a id='line_652'>  Thick set with trees, a venerable wood.</a>
<a id='line_653'>  The Tyrians, landing near this holy ground,</a>
<a id='line_654'>  And digging here, a prosp'rous omen found:</a>
<a id='line_655'>  From under earth a courser's head they drew,</a>
<a id='line_656'>  Their growth and future fortune to foreshew.</a>
<a id='line_657'>  This fated sign their foundress Juno gave,</a>
<a id='line_658'>  Of a soil fruitful, and a people brave.</a>
<a id='line_659'>  Sidonian Dido here with solemn state</a>
<a id='line_660'>  Did Juno's temple build, and consecrate,</a>
<a id='line_661'>  Enrich'd with gifts, and with a golden shrine;</a>
<a id='line_662'>  But more the goddess made the place divine.</a>
<a id='line_663'>  On brazen steps the marble threshold rose,</a>
<a id='line_664'>  And brazen plates the cedar beams inclose:</a>
<a id='line_665'>  The rafters are with brazen cov'rings crown'd;</a>
<a id='line_666'>  The lofty doors on brazen hinges sound.</a>
<a id='line_667'>  What first Aeneas this place beheld,</a>
<a id='line_668'>  Reviv'd his courage, and his fear expell'd.</a>
<a id='line_669'>  For while, expecting there the queen, he rais'd</a>
<a id='line_670'>  His wond'ring eyes, and round the temple gaz'd,</a>
<a id='line_671'>  Admir'd the fortune of the rising town,</a>
<a id='line_672'>  The striving artists, and their arts' renown;</a>
<a id='line_673'>  He saw, in order painted on the wall,</a>
<a id='line_674'>  Whatever did unhappy Troy befall:</a>
<a id='line_675'>  The wars that fame around the world had blown,</a>
<a id='line_676'>  All to the life, and ev'ry leader known.</a>
<a id='line_677'>  There Agamemnon, Priam here, he spies,</a>
<a id='line_678'>  And fierce Achilles, who both kings defies.</a>
<a id='line_679'>  He stopp'd, and weeping said: "O friend! ev'n here</a>
<a id='line_680'>  The monuments of Trojan woes appear!</a>
<a id='line_681'>  Our known disasters fill ev'n foreign lands:</a>
<a id='line_682'>  See there, where old unhappy Priam stands!</a>
<a id='line_683'>  Ev'n the mute walls relate the warrior's fame,</a>
<a id='line_684'>  And Trojan griefs the Tyrians' pity claim."</a>
<a id='line_685'>  He said (his tears a ready passage find),</a>
<a id='line_686'>  Devouring what he saw so well design'd,</a>
<a id='line_687'>  And with an empty picture fed his mind:</a>
<a id='line_688'>  For there he saw the fainting Grecians yield,</a>
<a id='line_689'>  And here the trembling Trojans quit the field,</a>
<a id='line_690'>  Pursued by fierce Achilles thro' the plain,</a>
<a id='line_691'>  On his high chariot driving o'er the slain.</a>
<a id='line_692'>  The tents of Rhesus next his grief renew,</a>
<a id='line_693'>  By their white sails betray'd to nightly view;</a>
<a id='line_694'>  And wakeful Diomede, whose cruel sword</a>
<a id='line_695'>  The sentries slew, nor spar'd their slumb'ring lord,</a>
<a id='line_696'>  Then took the fiery steeds, ere yet the food</a>
<a id='line_697'>  Of Troy they taste, or drink the Xanthian flood.</a>
<a id='line_698'>  Elsewhere he saw where Troilus defied</a>
<a id='line_699'>  Achilles, and unequal combat tried;</a>
<a id='line_700'>  Then, where the boy disarm'd, with loosen'd reins,</a>
<a id='line_701'>  Was by his horses hurried o'er the plains,</a>
<a id='line_702'>  Hung by the neck and hair, and dragg'd around:</a>
<a id='line_703'>  The hostile spear, yet sticking in his wound,</a>
<a id='line_704'>  With tracks of blood inscrib'd the dusty ground.</a>
<a id='line_705'>  Meantime the Trojan dames, oppress'd with woe,</a>
<a id='line_706'>  To Pallas' fane in long procession go,</a>
<a id='line_707'>  In hopes to reconcile their heav'nly foe.</a>
<a id='line_708'>  They weep, they beat their breasts, they rend their hair,</a>
<a id='line_709'>  And rich embroider'd vests for presents bear;</a>
<a id='line_710'>  But the stern goddess stands unmov'd with pray'r.</a>
<a id='line_711'>  Thrice round the Trojan walls Achilles drew</a>
<a id='line_712'>  The corpse of Hector, whom in fight he slew.</a>
<a id='line_713'>  Here Priam sues; and there, for sums of gold,</a>
<a id='line_714'>  The lifeless body of his son is sold.</a>
<a id='line_715'>  So sad an object, and so well express'd,</a>
<a id='line_716'>  Drew sighs and groans from the griev'd hero's breast,</a>
<a id='line_717'>  To see the figure of his lifeless friend,</a>
<a id='line_718'>  And his old sire his helpless hand extend.</a>
<a id='line_719'>  Himself he saw amidst the Grecian train,</a>
<a id='line_720'>  Mix'd in the bloody battle on the plain;</a>
<a id='line_721'>  And swarthy Memnon in his arms he knew,</a>
<a id='line_722'>  His pompous ensigns, and his Indian crew.</a>
<a id='line_723'>  Penthisilea there, with haughty grace,</a>
<a id='line_724'>  Leads to the wars an Amazonian race:</a>
<a id='line_725'>  In their right hands a pointed dart they wield;</a>
<a id='line_726'>  The left, for ward, sustains the lunar shield.</a>
<a id='line_727'>  Athwart her breast a golden belt she throws,</a>
<a id='line_728'>  Amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes,</a>
<a id='line_729'>  And dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose.</a>
<a id='line_730'></a>
<a id='line_731'>  Thus while the Trojan prince employs his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_732'>  Fix'd on the walls with wonder and surprise,</a>
<a id='line_733'>  The beauteous Dido, with a num'rous train</a>
<a id='line_734'>  And pomp of guards, ascends the sacred fane.</a>
<a id='line_735'>  Such on Eurotas' banks, or Cynthus' height,</a>
<a id='line_736'>  Diana seems; and so she charms the sight,</a>
<a id='line_737'>  When in the dance the graceful goddess leads</a>
<a id='line_738'>  The choir of nymphs, and overtops their heads:</a>
<a id='line_739'>  Known by her quiver, and her lofty mien,</a>
<a id='line_740'>  She walks majestic, and she looks their queen;</a>
<a id='line_741'>  Latona sees her shine above the rest,</a>
<a id='line_742'>  And feeds with secret joy her silent breast.</a>
<a id='line_743'>  Such Dido was; with such becoming state,</a>
<a id='line_744'>  Amidst the crowd, she walks serenely great.</a>
<a id='line_745'>  Their labor to her future sway she speeds,</a>
<a id='line_746'>  And passing with a gracious glance proceeds;</a>
<a id='line_747'>  Then mounts the throne, high plac'd before the shrine:</a>
<a id='line_748'>  In crowds around, the swarming people join.</a>
<a id='line_749'>  She takes petitions, and dispenses laws,</a>
<a id='line_750'>  Hears and determines ev'ry private cause;</a>
<a id='line_751'>  Their tasks in equal portions she divides,</a>
<a id='line_752'>  And, where unequal, there by lots decides.</a>
<a id='line_753'>  Another way by chance Aeneas bends</a>
<a id='line_754'>  His eyes, and unexpected sees his friends,</a>
<a id='line_755'>  Antheus, Sergestus grave, Cloanthus strong,</a>
<a id='line_756'>  And at their backs a mighty Trojan throng,</a>
<a id='line_757'>  Whom late the tempest on the billows toss'd,</a>
<a id='line_758'>  And widely scatter'd on another coast.</a>
<a id='line_759'>  The prince, unseen, surpris'd with wonder stands,</a>
<a id='line_760'>  And longs, with joyful haste, to join their hands;</a>
<a id='line_761'>  But, doubtful of the wish'd event, he stays,</a>
<a id='line_762'>  And from the hollow cloud his friends surveys,</a>
<a id='line_763'>  Impatient till they told their present state,</a>
<a id='line_764'>  And where they left their ships, and what their fate,</a>
<a id='line_765'>  And why they came, and what was their request;</a>
<a id='line_766'>  For these were sent, commission'd by the rest,</a>
<a id='line_767'>  To sue for leave to land their sickly men,</a>
<a id='line_768'>  And gain admission to the gracious queen.</a>
<a id='line_769'>  Ent'ring, with cries they fill'd the holy fane;</a>
<a id='line_770'>  Then thus, with lowly voice, Ilioneus began:</a>
<a id='line_771'></a>
<a id='line_772'>  "O queen! indulg'd by favor of the gods</a>
<a id='line_773'>  To found an empire in these new abodes,</a>
<a id='line_774'>  To build a town, with statutes to restrain</a>
<a id='line_775'>  The wild inhabitants beneath thy reign,</a>
<a id='line_776'>  We wretched Trojans, toss'd on ev'ry shore,</a>
<a id='line_777'>  From sea to sea, thy clemency implore.</a>
<a id='line_778'>  Forbid the fires our shipping to deface!</a>
<a id='line_779'>  Receive th' unhappy fugitives to grace,</a>
<a id='line_780'>  And spare the remnant of a pious race!</a>
<a id='line_781'>  We come not with design of wasteful prey,</a>
<a id='line_782'>  To drive the country, force the swains away:</a>
<a id='line_783'>  Nor such our strength, nor such is our desire;</a>
<a id='line_784'>  The vanquish'd dare not to such thoughts aspire.</a>
<a id='line_785'>  A land there is, Hesperia nam'd of old;</a>
<a id='line_786'>  The soil is fruitful, and the men are bold-</a>
<a id='line_787'>  Th' Oenotrians held it once- by common fame</a>
<a id='line_788'>  Now call'd Italia, from the leader's name.</a>
<a id='line_789'>  To that sweet region was our voyage bent,</a>
<a id='line_790'>  When winds and ev'ry warring element</a>
<a id='line_791'>  Disturb'd our course, and, far from sight of land,</a>
<a id='line_792'>  Cast our torn vessels on the moving sand:</a>
<a id='line_793'>  The sea came on; the South, with mighty roar,</a>
<a id='line_794'>  Dispers'd and dash'd the rest upon the rocky shore.</a>
<a id='line_795'>  Those few you see escap'd the Storm, and fear,</a>
<a id='line_796'>  Unless you interpose, a shipwreck here.</a>
<a id='line_797'>  What men, what monsters, what inhuman race,</a>
<a id='line_798'>  What laws, what barb'rous customs of the place,</a>
<a id='line_799'>  Shut up a desart shore to drowning men,</a>
<a id='line_800'>  And drive us to the cruel seas again?</a>
<a id='line_801'>  If our hard fortune no compassion draws,</a>
<a id='line_802'>  Nor hospitable rights, nor human laws,</a>
<a id='line_803'>  The gods are just, and will revenge our cause.</a>
<a id='line_804'>  Aeneas was our prince: a juster lord,</a>
<a id='line_805'>  Or nobler warrior, never drew a sword;</a>
<a id='line_806'>  Observant of the right, religious of his word.</a>
<a id='line_807'>  If yet he lives, and draws this vital air,</a>
<a id='line_808'>  Nor we, his friends, of safety shall despair;</a>
<a id='line_809'>  Nor you, great queen, these offices repent,</a>
<a id='line_810'>  Which he will equal, and perhaps augment.</a>
<a id='line_811'>  We want not cities, nor Sicilian coasts,</a>
<a id='line_812'>  Where King Acestes Trojan lineage boasts.</a>
<a id='line_813'>  Permit our ships a shelter on your shores,</a>
<a id='line_814'>  Refitted from your woods with planks and oars,</a>
<a id='line_815'>  That, if our prince be safe, we may renew</a>
<a id='line_816'>  Our destin'd course, and Italy pursue.</a>
<a id='line_817'>  But if, O best of men, the Fates ordain</a>
<a id='line_818'>  That thou art swallow'd in the Libyan main,</a>
<a id='line_819'>  And if our young Iulus be no more,</a>
<a id='line_820'>  Dismiss our navy from your friendly shore,</a>
<a id='line_821'>  That we to good Acestes may return,</a>
<a id='line_822'>  And with our friends our common losses mourn."</a>
<a id='line_823'>  Thus spoke Ilioneus: the Trojan crew</a>
<a id='line_824'>  With cries and clamors his request renew.</a>
<a id='line_825'></a>
<a id='line_826'>  The modest queen a while, with downcast eyes,</a>
<a id='line_827'>  Ponder'd the speech; then briefly thus replies:</a>
<a id='line_828'>  "Trojans, dismiss your fears; my cruel fate,</a>
<a id='line_829'>  And doubts attending an unsettled state,</a>
<a id='line_830'>  Force me to guard my coast from foreign foes.</a>
<a id='line_831'>  Who has not heard the story of your woes,</a>
<a id='line_832'>  The name and fortune of your native place,</a>
<a id='line_833'>  The fame and valor of the Phrygian race?</a>
<a id='line_834'>  We Tyrians are not so devoid of sense,</a>
<a id='line_835'>  Nor so remote from Phoebus' influence.</a>
<a id='line_836'>  Whether to Latian shores your course is bent,</a>
<a id='line_837'>  Or, driv'n by tempests from your first intent,</a>
<a id='line_838'>  You seek the good Acestes' government,</a>
<a id='line_839'>  Your men shall be receiv'd, your fleet repair'd,</a>
<a id='line_840'>  And sail, with ships of convoy for your guard:</a>
<a id='line_841'>  Or, would you stay, and join your friendly pow'rs</a>
<a id='line_842'>  To raise and to defend the Tyrian tow'rs,</a>
<a id='line_843'>  My wealth, my city, and myself are yours.</a>
<a id='line_844'>  And would to Heav'n, the Storm, you felt, would bring</a>
<a id='line_845'>  On Carthaginian coasts your wand'ring king.</a>
<a id='line_846'>  My people shall, by my command, explore</a>
<a id='line_847'>  The ports and creeks of ev'ry winding shore,</a>
<a id='line_848'>  And towns, and wilds, and shady woods, in quest</a>
<a id='line_849'>  Of so renown'd and so desir'd a guest."</a>
<a id='line_850'></a>
<a id='line_851'>  Rais'd in his mind the Trojan hero stood,</a>
<a id='line_852'>  And long'd to break from out his ambient cloud:</a>
<a id='line_853'>  Achates found it, and thus urg'd his way:</a>
<a id='line_854'>  "From whence, O goddess-born, this long delay?</a>
<a id='line_855'>  What more can you desire, your welcome sure,</a>
<a id='line_856'>  Your fleet in safety, and your friends secure?</a>
<a id='line_857'>  One only wants; and him we saw in vain</a>
<a id='line_858'>  Oppose the Storm, and swallow'd in the main.</a>
<a id='line_859'>  Orontes in his fate our forfeit paid;</a>
<a id='line_860'>  The rest agrees with what your mother said."</a>
<a id='line_861'>  Scarce had he spoken, when the cloud gave way,</a>
<a id='line_862'>  The mists flew upward and dissolv'd in day.</a>
<a id='line_863'></a>
<a id='line_864'>  The Trojan chief appear'd in open sight,</a>
<a id='line_865'>  August in visage, and serenely bright.</a>
<a id='line_866'>  His mother goddess, with her hands divine,</a>
<a id='line_867'>  Had form'd his curling locks, and made his temples shine,</a>
<a id='line_868'>  And giv'n his rolling eyes a sparkling grace,</a>
<a id='line_869'>  And breath'd a youthful vigor on his face;</a>
<a id='line_870'>  Like polish'd ivory, beauteous to behold,</a>
<a id='line_871'>  Or Parian marble, when enchas'd in gold:</a>
<a id='line_872'>  Thus radiant from the circling cloud he broke,</a>
<a id='line_873'>  And thus with manly modesty he spoke:</a>
<a id='line_874'></a>
<a id='line_875'>  "He whom you seek am I; by tempests toss'd,</a>
<a id='line_876'>  And sav'd from shipwreck on your Libyan coast;</a>
<a id='line_877'>  Presenting, gracious queen, before your throne,</a>
<a id='line_878'>  A prince that owes his life to you alone.</a>
<a id='line_879'>  Fair majesty, the refuge and redress</a>
<a id='line_880'>  Of those whom fate pursues, and wants oppress,</a>
<a id='line_881'>  You, who your pious offices employ</a>
<a id='line_882'>  To save the relics of abandon'd Troy;</a>
<a id='line_883'>  Receive the shipwreck'd on your friendly shore,</a>
<a id='line_884'>  With hospitable rites relieve the poor;</a>
<a id='line_885'>  Associate in your town a wand'ring train,</a>
<a id='line_886'>  And strangers in your palace entertain:</a>
<a id='line_887'>  What thanks can wretched fugitives return,</a>
<a id='line_888'>  Who, scatter'd thro' the world, in exile mourn?</a>
<a id='line_889'>  The gods, if gods to goodness are inclin'd;</a>
<a id='line_890'>  If acts of mercy touch their heav'nly mind,</a>
<a id='line_891'>  And, more than all the gods, your gen'rous heart.</a>
<a id='line_892'>  Conscious of worth, requite its own desert!</a>
<a id='line_893'>  In you this age is happy, and this earth,</a>
<a id='line_894'>  And parents more than mortal gave you birth.</a>
<a id='line_895'>  While rolling rivers into seas shall run,</a>
<a id='line_896'>  And round the space of heav'n the radiant sun;</a>
<a id='line_897'>  While trees the mountain tops with shades supply,</a>
<a id='line_898'>  Your honor, name, and praise shall never die.</a>
<a id='line_899'>  Whate'er abode my fortune has assign'd,</a>
<a id='line_900'>  Your image shall be present in my mind."</a>
<a id='line_901'>  Thus having said, he turn'd with pious haste,</a>
<a id='line_902'>  And joyful his expecting friends embrac'd:</a>
<a id='line_903'>  With his right hand Ilioneus was grac'd,</a>
<a id='line_904'>  Serestus with his left; then to his breast</a>
<a id='line_905'>  Cloanthus and the noble Gyas press'd;</a>
<a id='line_906'>  And so by turns descended to the rest.</a>
<a id='line_907'></a>
<a id='line_908'>  The Tyrian queen stood fix'd upon his face,</a>
<a id='line_909'>  Pleas'd with his motions, ravish'd with his grace;</a>
<a id='line_910'>  Admir'd his fortunes, more admir'd the man;</a>
<a id='line_911'>  Then recollected stood, and thus began:</a>
<a id='line_912'>  "What fate, O goddess-born; what angry pow'rs</a>
<a id='line_913'>  Have cast you shipwrack'd on our barren shores?</a>
<a id='line_914'>  Are you the great Aeneas, known to fame,</a>
<a id='line_915'>  Who from celestial seed your lineage claim?</a>
<a id='line_916'></a>
<a id='line_917'>  The same Aeneas whom fair Venus bore</a>
<a id='line_918'>  To fam'd Anchises on th' Idaean shore?</a>
<a id='line_919'>  It calls into my mind, tho' then a child,</a>
<a id='line_920'>  When Teucer came, from Salamis exil'd,</a>
<a id='line_921'>  And sought my father's aid, to be restor'd:</a>
<a id='line_922'>  My father Belus then with fire and sword</a>
<a id='line_923'>  Invaded Cyprus, made the region bare,</a>
<a id='line_924'>  And, conqu'ring, finish'd the successful war.</a>
<a id='line_925'>  From him the Trojan siege I understood,</a>
<a id='line_926'>  The Grecian chiefs, and your illustrious blood.</a>
<a id='line_927'>  Your foe himself the Dardan valor prais'd,</a>
<a id='line_928'>  And his own ancestry from Trojans rais'd.</a>
<a id='line_929'>  Enter, my noble guest, and you shall find,</a>
<a id='line_930'>  If not a costly welcome, yet a kind:</a>
<a id='line_931'>  For I myself, like you, have been distress'd,</a>
<a id='line_932'>  Till Heav'n afforded me this place of rest;</a>
<a id='line_933'>  Like you, an alien in a land unknown,</a>
<a id='line_934'>  I learn to pity woes so like my own."</a>
<a id='line_935'>  She said, and to the palace led her guest;</a>
<a id='line_936'>  Then offer'd incense, and proclaim'd a feast.</a>
<a id='line_937'>  Nor yet less careful for her absent friends,</a>
<a id='line_938'>  Twice ten fat oxen to the ships she sends;</a>
<a id='line_939'>  Besides a hundred boars, a hundred lambs,</a>
<a id='line_940'>  With bleating cries, attend their milky dams;</a>
<a id='line_941'>  And jars of gen'rous wine and spacious bowls</a>
<a id='line_942'>  She gives, to cheer the sailors' drooping souls.</a>
<a id='line_943'>  Now purple hangings clothe the palace walls,</a>
<a id='line_944'>  And sumptuous feasts are made in splendid halls:</a>
<a id='line_945'>  On Tyrian carpets, richly wrought, they dine;</a>
<a id='line_946'>  With loads of massy plate the sideboards shine,</a>
<a id='line_947'>  And antique vases, all of gold emboss'd</a>
<a id='line_948'>  (The gold itself inferior to the cost),</a>
<a id='line_949'>  Of curious work, where on the sides were seen</a>
<a id='line_950'>  The fights and figures of illustrious men,</a>
<a id='line_951'>  From their first founder to the present queen.</a>
<a id='line_952'></a>
<a id='line_953'>  The good Aeneas, paternal care</a>
<a id='line_954'>  Iulus' absence could no longer bear,</a>
<a id='line_955'>  Dispatch'd Achates to the ships in haste,</a>
<a id='line_956'>  To give a glad relation of the past,</a>
<a id='line_957'>  And, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy,</a>
<a id='line_958'>  Snatch'd from the ruins of unhappy Troy:</a>
<a id='line_959'>  A robe of tissue, stiff with golden wire;</a>
<a id='line_960'>  An upper vest, once Helen's rich attire,</a>
<a id='line_961'>  From Argos by the fam'd adultress brought,</a>
<a id='line_962'>  With golden flow'rs and winding foliage wrought,</a>
<a id='line_963'>  Her mother Leda's present, when she came</a>
<a id='line_964'>  To ruin Troy and set the world on flame;</a>
<a id='line_965'>  The scepter Priam's eldest daughter bore,</a>
<a id='line_966'>  Her orient necklace, and the crown she wore</a>
<a id='line_967'>  Of double texture, glorious to behold,</a>
<a id='line_968'>  One order set with gems, and one with gold.</a>
<a id='line_969'>  Instructed thus, the wise Achates goes,</a>
<a id='line_970'>  And in his diligence his duty shows.</a>
<a id='line_971'></a>
<a id='line_972'>  But Venus, anxious for her son's affairs,</a>
<a id='line_973'>  New counsels tries, and new designs prepares:</a>
<a id='line_974'>  That Cupid should assume the shape and face</a>
<a id='line_975'>  Of sweet Ascanius, and the sprightly grace;</a>
<a id='line_976'>  Should bring the presents, in her nephew's stead,</a>
<a id='line_977'>  And in Eliza's veins the gentle poison shed:</a>
<a id='line_978'>  For much she fear'd the Tyrians, double-tongued,</a>
<a id='line_979'>  And knew the town to Juno's care belong'd.</a>
<a id='line_980'>  These thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke,</a>
<a id='line_981'>  And thus alarm'd, to winged Love she spoke:</a>
<a id='line_982'>  "My son, my strength, whose mighty pow'r alone</a>
<a id='line_983'>  Controls the Thund'rer on his awful throne,</a>
<a id='line_984'>  To thee thy much-afflicted mother flies,</a>
<a id='line_985'>  And on thy succor and thy faith relies.</a>
<a id='line_986'>  Thou know'st, my son, how Jove's revengeful wife,</a>
<a id='line_987'>  By force and fraud, attempts thy brother's life;</a>
<a id='line_988'>  And often hast thou mourn'd with me his pains.</a>
<a id='line_989'>  Him Dido now with blandishment detains;</a>
<a id='line_990'>  But I suspect the town where Juno reigns.</a>
<a id='line_991'>  For this 't is needful to prevent her art,</a>
<a id='line_992'>  And fire with love the proud Phoenician's heart:</a>
<a id='line_993'>  A love so violent, so strong, so sure,</a>
<a id='line_994'>  As neither age can change, nor art can cure.</a>
<a id='line_995'>  How this may be perform'd, now take my mind:</a>
<a id='line_996'>  Ascanius by his father is design'd</a>
<a id='line_997'>  To come, with presents laden, from the port,</a>
<a id='line_998'>  To gratify the queen, and gain the court.</a>
<a id='line_999'>  I mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep,</a>
<a id='line_1000'>  And, ravish'd, in Idalian bow'rs to keep,</a>
<a id='line_1001'>  Or high Cythera, that the sweet deceit</a>
<a id='line_1002'>  May pass unseen, and none prevent the cheat.</a>
<a id='line_1003'>  Take thou his form and shape. I beg the grace</a>
<a id='line_1004'>  But only for a night's revolving space:</a>
<a id='line_1005'>  Thyself a boy, assume a boy's dissembled face;</a>
<a id='line_1006'>  That when, amidst the fervor of the feast,</a>
<a id='line_1007'>  The Tyrian hugs and fonds thee on her breast,</a>
<a id='line_1008'>  And with sweet kisses in her arms constrains,</a>
<a id='line_1009'>  Thou may'st infuse thy venom in her veins."</a>
<a id='line_1010'>  The God of Love obeys, and sets aside</a>
<a id='line_1011'>  His bow and quiver, and his plumy pride;</a>
<a id='line_1012'>  He walks Iulus in his mother's sight,</a>
<a id='line_1013'>  And in the sweet resemblance takes delight.</a>
<a id='line_1014'></a>
<a id='line_1015'>  The goddess then to young Ascanius flies,</a>
<a id='line_1016'>  And in a pleasing slumber seals his eyes:</a>
<a id='line_1017'>  Lull'd in her lap, amidst a train of Loves,</a>
<a id='line_1018'>  She gently bears him to her blissful groves,</a>
<a id='line_1019'>  Then with a wreath of myrtle crowns his head,</a>
<a id='line_1020'>  And softly lays him on a flow'ry bed.</a>
<a id='line_1021'>  Cupid meantime assum'd his form and face,</a>
<a id='line_1022'>  Foll'wing Achates with a shorter pace,</a>
<a id='line_1023'>  And brought the gifts. The queen already sate</a>
<a id='line_1024'>  Amidst the Trojan lords, in shining state,</a>
<a id='line_1025'>  High on a golden bed: her princely guest</a>
<a id='line_1026'>  Was next her side; in order sate the rest.</a>
<a id='line_1027'>  Then canisters with bread are heap'd on high;</a>
<a id='line_1028'>  Th' attendants water for their hands supply,</a>
<a id='line_1029'>  And, having wash'd, with silken towels dry.</a>
<a id='line_1030'>  Next fifty handmaids in long order bore</a>
<a id='line_1031'>  The censers, and with fumes the gods adore:</a>
<a id='line_1032'>  Then youths, and virgins twice as many, join</a>
<a id='line_1033'>  To place the dishes, and to serve the wine.</a>
<a id='line_1034'>  The Tyrian train, admitted to the feast,</a>
<a id='line_1035'>  Approach, and on the painted couches rest.</a>
<a id='line_1036'>  All on the Trojan gifts with wonder gaze,</a>
<a id='line_1037'>  But view the beauteous boy with more amaze,</a>
<a id='line_1038'>  His rosy-color'd cheeks, his radiant eyes,</a>
<a id='line_1039'>  His motions, voice, and shape, and all the god's disguise;</a>
<a id='line_1040'>  Nor pass unprais'd the vest and veil divine,</a>
<a id='line_1041'>  Which wand'ring foliage and rich flow'rs entwine.</a>
<a id='line_1042'>  But, far above the rest, the royal dame,</a>
<a id='line_1043'>  (Already doom'd to love's disastrous flame,)</a>
<a id='line_1044'>  With eyes insatiate, and tumultuous joy,</a>
<a id='line_1045'>  Beholds the presents, and admires the boy.</a>
<a id='line_1046'>  The guileful god about the hero long,</a>
<a id='line_1047'>  With children's play, and false embraces, hung;</a>
<a id='line_1048'>  Then sought the queen: she took him to her arms</a>
<a id='line_1049'>  With greedy pleasure, and devour'd his charms.</a>
<a id='line_1050'>  Unhappy Dido little thought what guest,</a>
<a id='line_1051'>  How dire a god, she drew so near her breast;</a>
<a id='line_1052'>  But he, not mindless of his mother's pray'r,</a>
<a id='line_1053'>  Works in the pliant bosom of the fair,</a>
<a id='line_1054'>  And molds her heart anew, and blots her former care.</a>
<a id='line_1055'>  The dead is to the living love resign'd;</a>
<a id='line_1056'>  And all Aeneas enters in her mind.</a>
<a id='line_1057'></a>
<a id='line_1058'>  Now, when the rage of hunger was appeas'd,</a>
<a id='line_1059'>  The meat remov'd, and ev'ry guest was pleas'd,</a>
<a id='line_1060'>  The golden bowls with sparkling wine are crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_1061'>  And thro' the palace cheerful cries resound.</a>
<a id='line_1062'>  From gilded roofs depending lamps display</a>
<a id='line_1063'>  Nocturnal beams, that emulate the day.</a>
<a id='line_1064'>  A golden bowl, that shone with gems divine,</a>
<a id='line_1065'>  The queen commanded to be crown'd with wine:</a>
<a id='line_1066'>  The bowl that Belus us'd, and all the Tyrian line.</a>
<a id='line_1067'>  Then, silence thro' the hall proclaim'd, she spoke:</a>
<a id='line_1068'>  "O hospitable Jove! we thus invoke,</a>
<a id='line_1069'>  With solemn rites, thy sacred name and pow'r;</a>
<a id='line_1070'>  Bless to both nations this auspicious hour!</a>
<a id='line_1071'>  So may the Trojan and the Tyrian line</a>
<a id='line_1072'>  In lasting concord from this day combine.</a>
<a id='line_1073'>  Thou, Bacchus, god of joys and friendly cheer,</a>
<a id='line_1074'>  And gracious Juno, both be present here!</a>
<a id='line_1075'>  And you, my lords of Tyre, your vows address</a>
<a id='line_1076'>  To Heav'n with mine, to ratify the peace."</a>
<a id='line_1077'>  The goblet then she took, with nectar crown'd</a>
<a id='line_1078'>  (Sprinkling the first libations on the ground,)</a>
<a id='line_1079'>  And rais'd it to her mouth with sober grace;</a>
<a id='line_1080'>  Then, sipping, offer'd to the next in place.</a>
<a id='line_1081'>  'T was Bitias whom she call'd, a thirsty soul;</a>
<a id='line_1082'>  He took challenge, and embrac'd the bowl,</a>
<a id='line_1083'>  With pleasure swill'd the gold, nor ceas'd to draw,</a>
<a id='line_1084'>  Till he the bottom of the brimmer saw.</a>
<a id='line_1085'>  The goblet goes around: Iopas brought</a>
<a id='line_1086'>  His golden lyre, and sung what ancient Atlas taught:</a>
<a id='line_1087'>  The various labors of the wand'ring moon,</a>
<a id='line_1088'>  And whence proceed th' eclipses of the sun;</a>
<a id='line_1089'>  Th' original of men and beasts; and whence</a>
<a id='line_1090'>  The rains arise, and fires their warmth dispense,</a>
<a id='line_1091'>  And fix'd and erring stars dispose their influence;</a>
<a id='line_1092'>  What shakes the solid earth; what cause delays</a>
<a id='line_1093'>  The summer nights and shortens winter days.</a>
<a id='line_1094'>  With peals of shouts the Tyrians praise the song:</a>
<a id='line_1095'>  Those peals are echo'd by the Trojan throng.</a>
<a id='line_1096'>  Th' unhappy queen with talk prolong'd the night,</a>
<a id='line_1097'>  And drank large draughts of love with vast delight;</a>
<a id='line_1098'>  Of Priam much enquir'd, of Hector more;</a>
<a id='line_1099'>  Then ask'd what arms the swarthy Memnon wore,</a>
<a id='line_1100'>  What troops he landed on the Trojan shore;</a>
<a id='line_1101'>  The steeds of Diomede varied the discourse,</a>
<a id='line_1102'>  And fierce Achilles, with his matchless force;</a>
<a id='line_1103'>  At length, as fate and her ill stars requir'd,</a>
<a id='line_1104'>  To hear the series of the war desir'd.</a>
<a id='line_1105'>  "Relate at large, my godlike guest," she said,</a>
<a id='line_1106'>  "The Grecian stratagems, the town betray'd:</a>

<a id='line_1109'>  For, since on ev'ry sea, on ev'ry coast,</a>

<a id='line_1119'>  All were attentive to the godlike man,</a>
<a id='line_1120'>  When from his lofty couch he thus began:</a>
<a id='line_1121'>  "Great queen, what you command me to relate</a>
<a id='line_1122'>  Renews the sad remembrance of our fate:</a>
<a id='line_1123'>  An empire from its old foundations rent,</a>
<a id='line_1124'>  And ev'ry woe the Trojans underwent;</a>
<a id='line_1125'>  A peopled city made a desart place;</a>
<a id='line_1126'>  All that I saw, and part of which I was:</a>
<a id='line_1127'>  Not ev'n the hardest of our foes could hear,</a>
<a id='line_1128'>  Nor stern Ulysses tell without a tear.</a>
<a id='line_1129'>  And now the latter watch of wasting night,</a>
<a id='line_1130'>  And setting stars, to kindly rest invite;</a>
<a id='line_1131'>  But, since you take such int'rest in our woe,</a>
<a id='line_1132'>  And Troy's disastrous end desire to know,</a>
<a id='line_1133'>  I will restrain my tears, and briefly tell</a>
<a id='line_1134'>  What in our last and fatal night befell.</a>
<a id='line_1135'></a>
<a id='line_1136'>  "By destiny compell'd, and in despair,</a>
<a id='line_1137'>  The Greeks grew weary of the tedious war,</a>
<a id='line_1138'>  And by Minerva's aid a fabric rear'd,</a>
<a id='line_1139'>  Which like a steed of monstrous height appear'd:</a>
<a id='line_1140'>  The sides were plank'd with pine; they feign'd it made</a>
<a id='line_1141'>  For their return, and this the vow they paid.</a>
<a id='line_1142'>  Thus they pretend, but in the hollow side</a>
<a id='line_1143'>  Selected numbers of their soldiers hide:</a>
<a id='line_1144'>  With inward arms the dire machine they load,</a>
<a id='line_1145'>  And iron bowels stuff the dark abode.</a>
<a id='line_1146'>  In sight of Troy lies Tenedos, an isle</a>
<a id='line_1147'>  (While Fortune did on Priam's empire smile)</a>
<a id='line_1148'>  Renown'd for wealth; but, since, a faithless bay,</a>
<a id='line_1149'>  Where ships expos'd to wind and weather lay.</a>
<a id='line_1150'>  There was their fleet conceal'd. We thought, for Greece</a>
<a id='line_1151'>  Their sails were hoisted, and our fears release.</a>
<a id='line_1152'>  The Trojans, coop'd within their walls so long,</a>
<a id='line_1153'>  Unbar their gates, and issue in a throng,</a>
<a id='line_1154'>  Like swarming bees, and with delight survey</a>
<a id='line_1155'>  The camp deserted, where the Grecians lay:</a>
<a id='line_1156'>  The quarters of the sev'ral chiefs they show'd;</a>
<a id='line_1157'>  Here Phoenix, here Achilles, made abode;</a>
<a id='line_1158'>  Here join'd the battles; there the navy rode.</a>
<a id='line_1159'>  Part on the pile their wond'ring eyes employ:</a>
<a id='line_1160'>  The pile by Pallas rais'd to ruin Troy.</a>
<a id='line_1161'>  Thymoetes first ('t is doubtful whether hir'd,</a>
<a id='line_1162'>  Or so the Trojan destiny requir'd)</a>
<a id='line_1163'>  Mov'd that the ramparts might be broken down,</a>
<a id='line_1164'>  To lodge the monster fabric in the town.</a>
<a id='line_1165'>  But Capys, and the rest of sounder mind,</a>
<a id='line_1166'>  The fatal present to the flames designed,</a>
<a id='line_1167'>  Or to the wat'ry deep; at least to bore</a>
<a id='line_1168'>  The hollow sides, and hidden frauds explore.</a>
<a id='line_1169'>  The giddy vulgar, as their fancies guide,</a>
<a id='line_1170'>  With noise say nothing, and in parts divide.</a>
<a id='line_1171'>  Laocoon, follow'd by a num'rous crowd,</a>
<a id='line_1172'>  Ran from the fort, and cried, from far, aloud:</a>
<a id='line_1173'>  'O wretched countrymen! what fury reigns?</a>
<a id='line_1174'>  What more than madness has possess'd your brains?</a>
<a id='line_1175'>  Think you the Grecians from your coasts are gone?</a>
<a id='line_1176'>  And are Ulysses' arts no better known?</a>
<a id='line_1177'>  This hollow fabric either must inclose,</a>
<a id='line_1178'>  Within its blind recess, our secret foes;</a>
<a id='line_1179'>  Or 't is an engine rais'd above the town,</a>
<a id='line_1180'>  T' o'erlook the walls, and then to batter down.</a>
<a id='line_1181'>  Somewhat is sure design'd, by fraud or force:</a>
<a id='line_1182'>  Trust not their presents, nor admit the horse.'</a>
<a id='line_1183'>  Thus having said, against the steed he threw</a>
<a id='line_1184'>  His forceful spear, which, hissing as flew,</a>
<a id='line_1185'>  Pierc'd thro' the yielding planks of jointed wood,</a>
<a id='line_1186'>  And trembling in the hollow belly stood.</a>
<a id='line_1187'>  The sides, transpierc'd, return a rattling sound,</a>
<a id='line_1188'>  And groans of Greeks inclos'd come issuing thro' the wound</a>
<a id='line_1189'>  And, had not Heav'n the fall of Troy design'd,</a>
<a id='line_1190'>  Or had not men been fated to be blind,</a>
<a id='line_1191'>  Enough was said and done t'inspire a better mind.</a>
<a id='line_1192'>  Then had our lances pierc'd the treach'rous wood,</a>
<a id='line_1193'>  And Ilian tow'rs and Priam's empire stood.</a>
<a id='line_1194'>  Meantime, with shouts, the Trojan shepherds bring</a>
<a id='line_1195'>  A captive Greek, in bands, before the king;</a>
<a id='line_1196'>  Taken to take; who made himself their prey,</a>
<a id='line_1197'>  T' impose on their belief, and Troy betray;</a>
<a id='line_1198'>  Fix'd on his aim, and obstinately bent</a>
<a id='line_1199'>  To die undaunted, or to circumvent.</a>
<a id='line_1200'>  About the captive, tides of Trojans flow;</a>
<a id='line_1201'>  All press to see, and some insult the foe.</a>
<a id='line_1202'>  Now hear how well the Greeks their wiles disguis'd;</a>
<a id='line_1203'>  Behold a nation in a man compris'd.</a>
<a id='line_1204'>  Trembling the miscreant stood, unarm'd and bound;</a>
<a id='line_1205'>  He star'd, and roll'd his haggard eyes around,</a>
<a id='line_1206'>  Then said: 'Alas! what earth remains, what sea</a>
<a id='line_1207'>  Is open to receive unhappy me?</a>
<a id='line_1208'>  What fate a wretched fugitive attends,</a>
<a id='line_1209'>  Scorn'd by my foes, abandon'd by my friends?'</a>
<a id='line_1210'>  He said, and sigh'd, and cast a rueful eye:</a>
<a id='line_1211'>  Our pity kindles, and our passions die.</a>
<a id='line_1212'>  We cheer youth to make his own defense,</a>
<a id='line_1213'>  And freely tell us what he was, and whence:</a>
<a id='line_1214'>  What news he could impart, we long to know,</a>
<a id='line_1215'>  And what to credit from a captive foe.</a>
<a id='line_1216'></a>
<a id='line_1217'>  "His fear at length dismiss'd, he said: 'Whate'er</a>
<a id='line_1218'>  My fate ordains, my words shall be sincere:</a>
<a id='line_1219'>  I neither can nor dare my birth disclaim;</a>
<a id='line_1220'>  Greece is my country, Sinon is my name.</a>
<a id='line_1221'>  Tho' plung'd by Fortune's pow'r in misery,</a>
<a id='line_1222'>  'T is not in Fortune's pow'r to make me lie.</a>

<a id='line_1226'>  Accus'd and sentenc'd for pretended crimes,</a>
<a id='line_1227'>  Because these fatal wars he would prevent;</a>

<a id='line_1232'>  While Fortune favor'd, while his arms support</a>
<a id='line_1233'>  The cause, and rul'd the counsels, of the court,</a>
<a id='line_1234'>  I made some figure there; nor was my name</a>
<a id='line_1235'>  Obscure, nor I without my share of fame.</a>
<a id='line_1236'>  But when Ulysses, with fallacious arts,</a>
<a id='line_1237'>  Had made impression in the people's hearts,</a>
<a id='line_1238'>  And forg'd a treason in my patron's name</a>
<a id='line_1239'>  (I speak of things too far divulg'd by fame),</a>
<a id='line_1240'>  My kinsman fell. Then I, without support,</a>
<a id='line_1241'>  In private mourn'd his loss, and left the court.</a>
<a id='line_1242'>  Mad as I was, I could not bear his fate</a>
<a id='line_1243'>  With silent grief, but loudly blam'd the state,</a>
<a id='line_1244'>  And curs'd the direful author of my woes.</a>
<a id='line_1245'>  'T was told again; and hence my ruin rose.</a>
<a id='line_1246'>  I threaten'd, if indulgent Heav'n once more</a>

<a id='line_1398'>  Their bellies seem to burn the seas below;</a>
<a id='line_1399'>  Their speckled tails advance to steer their course,</a>
<a id='line_1400'>  And on the sounding shore the flying billows force.</a>
<a id='line_1401'>  And now the strand, and now the plain they held;</a>
<a id='line_1402'>  Their ardent eyes with bloody streaks were fill'd;</a>
<a id='line_1403'>  Their nimble tongues they brandish'd as they came,</a>
<a id='line_1404'>  And lick'd their hissing jaws, that sputter'd flame.</a>
<a id='line_1405'>  We fled amaz'd; their destin'd way they take,</a>
<a id='line_1406'>  And to Laocoon and his children make;</a>

<a id='line_1408'>  Then with their sharpen'd fangs their limbs and bodies grind.</a>

<a id='line_1872'>  The laws of nature and of nations heard.</a>
<a id='line_1873'>  He cheer'd my sorrows, and, for sums of gold,</a>
<a id='line_1874'>  The bloodless carcass of my Hector sold;</a>
<a id='line_1875'>  Pitied the woes a parent underwent,</a>
<a id='line_1876'>  And sent me back in safety from his tent.'</a>
<a id='line_1877'></a>
<a id='line_1878'>  "This said, his feeble hand a javelin threw,</a>
<a id='line_1879'>  Which, flutt'ring, seem'd to loiter as it flew:</a>
<a id='line_1880'>  Just, and but barely, to the mark it held,</a>
<a id='line_1881'>  And faintly tinkled on the brazen shield.</a>
<a id='line_1882'></a>
<a id='line_1883'>  "Then Pyrrhus thus: 'Go thou from me to fate,</a>
<a id='line_1884'>  And to my father my foul deeds relate.</a>
<a id='line_1885'>  Now die!' With that he dragg'd the trembling sire,</a>
<a id='line_1886'>  Slidd'ring thro' clotter'd blood and holy mire,</a>
<a id='line_1887'>  (The mingled paste his murder'd son had made,)</a>
<a id='line_1888'>  Haul'd from beneath the violated shade,</a>
<a id='line_1889'>  And on the sacred pile the royal victim laid.</a>
<a id='line_1890'>  His right hand held his bloody falchion bare,</a>
<a id='line_1891'>  His left he twisted in his hoary hair;</a>
<a id='line_1892'>  Then, with a speeding thrust, his heart he found:</a>
<a id='line_1893'>  The lukewarm blood came rushing thro' the wound,</a>
<a id='line_1894'>  And sanguine streams distain'd the sacred ground.</a>
<a id='line_1895'>  Thus Priam fell, and shar'd one common fate</a>
<a id='line_1896'>  With Troy in ashes, and his ruin'd state:</a>
<a id='line_1897'>  He, who the scepter of all Asia sway'd,</a>
<a id='line_1898'>  Whom monarchs like domestic slaves obey'd.</a>
<a id='line_1899'>  On the bleak shore now lies th' abandon'd king,</a>
<a id='line_1900'>  A headless carcass, and a nameless thing.</a>
<a id='line_1901'></a>
<a id='line_1902'>  "Then, not before, I felt my cruddled blood</a>
<a id='line_1903'>  Congeal with fear, my hair with horror stood:</a>
<a id='line_1904'>  My father's image fill'd my pious mind,</a>
<a id='line_1905'>  Lest equal years might equal fortune find.</a>
<a id='line_1906'>  Again I thought on my forsaken wife,</a>
<a id='line_1907'>  And trembled for my son's abandon'd life.</a>
<a id='line_1908'>  I look'd about, but found myself alone,</a>
<a id='line_1909'>  Deserted at my need! My friends were gone.</a>
<a id='line_1910'>  Some spent with toil, some with despair oppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_1911'>  Leap'd headlong from the heights; the flames consum'd the rest.</a>
<a id='line_1912'>  Thus, wand'ring in my way, without a guide,</a>
<a id='line_1913'>  The graceless Helen in the porch I spied</a>
<a id='line_1914'>  Of Vesta's temple; there she lurk'd alone;</a>
<a id='line_1915'>  Muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown:</a>
<a id='line_1916'>  But, by the flames that cast their blaze around,</a>
<a id='line_1917'>  That common bane of Greece and Troy I found.</a>
<a id='line_1918'>  For Ilium burnt, she dreads the Trojan sword;</a>
<a id='line_1919'>  More dreads the vengeance of her injur'd lord;</a>
<a id='line_1920'>  Ev'n by those gods who refug'd her abhorr'd.</a>
<a id='line_1921'>  Trembling with rage, the strumpet I regard,</a>
<a id='line_1922'>  Resolv'd to give her guilt the due reward:</a>
<a id='line_1923'>  'Shall she triumphant sail before the wind,</a>
<a id='line_1924'>  And leave in flames unhappy Troy behind?</a>
<a id='line_1925'>  Shall she her kingdom and her friends review,</a>
<a id='line_1926'>  In state attended with a captive crew,</a>
<a id='line_1927'>  While unreveng'd the good old Priam falls,</a>
<a id='line_1928'>  And Grecian fires consume the Trojan walls?</a>
<a id='line_1929'>  For this the Phrygian fields and Xanthian flood</a>
<a id='line_1930'>  Were swell'd with bodies, and were drunk with blood?</a>
<a id='line_1931'>  'T is true, a soldier can small honor gain,</a>
<a id='line_1932'>  And boast no conquest, from a woman slain:</a>
<a id='line_1933'>  Yet shall the fact not pass without applause,</a>
<a id='line_1934'>  Of vengeance taken in so just a cause;</a>
<a id='line_1935'>  The punish'd crime shall set my soul at ease,</a>
<a id='line_1936'>  And murm'ring manes of my friends appease.'</a>
<a id='line_1937'>  Thus while I rave, a gleam of pleasing light</a>
<a id='line_1938'>  Spread o'er the place; and, shining heav'nly bright,</a>
<a id='line_1939'>  My mother stood reveal'd before my sight</a>
<a id='line_1940'>  Never so radiant did her eyes appear;</a>
<a id='line_1941'>  Not her own star confess'd a light so clear:</a>
<a id='line_1942'>  Great in her charms, as when on gods above</a>
<a id='line_1943'>  She looks, and breathes herself into their love.</a>
<a id='line_1944'>  She held my hand, the destin'd blow to break;</a>
<a id='line_1945'>  Then from her rosy lips began to speak:</a>
<a id='line_1946'>  'My son, from whence this madness, this neglect</a>
<a id='line_1947'>  Of my commands, and those whom I protect?</a>
<a id='line_1948'>  Why this unmanly rage? Recall to mind</a>
<a id='line_1949'>  Whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind.</a>
<a id='line_1950'>  Look if your helpless father yet survive,</a>
<a id='line_1951'>  Or if Ascanius or Creusa live.</a>
<a id='line_1952'>  Around your house the greedy Grecians err;</a>
<a id='line_1953'>  And these had perish'd in the nightly war,</a>
<a id='line_1954'>  But for my presence and protecting care.</a>
<a id='line_1955'>  Not Helen's face, nor Paris, was in fault;</a>
<a id='line_1956'>  But by the gods was this destruction brought.</a>
<a id='line_1957'>  Now cast your eyes around, while I dissolve</a>
<a id='line_1958'>  The mists and films that mortal eyes involve,</a>
<a id='line_1959'>  Purge from your sight the dross, and make you see</a>
<a id='line_1960'>  The shape of each avenging deity.</a>
<a id='line_1961'>  Enlighten'd thus, my just commands fulfil,</a>
<a id='line_1962'>  Nor fear obedience to your mother's will.</a>

<a id='line_1964'>  Stones rent from stones; where clouds of dust arise-</a>
<a id='line_1965'>  Amid that smother Neptune holds his place,</a>
<a id='line_1966'>  Below the wall's foundation drives his mace,</a>
<a id='line_1967'>  And heaves the building from the solid base.</a>
<a id='line_1968'>  Look where, in arms, imperial Juno stands</a>
<a id='line_1969'>  Full in the Scaean gate, with loud commands,</a>
<a id='line_1970'>  Urging on shore the tardy Grecian bands.</a>
<a id='line_1971'>  See! Pallas, of her snaky buckler proud,</a>
<a id='line_1972'>  Bestrides the tow'r, refulgent thro' the cloud:</a>
<a id='line_1973'>  See! Jove new courage to the foe supplies,</a>
<a id='line_1974'>  And arms against the town the partial deities.</a>
<a id='line_1975'>  Haste hence, my son; this fruitless labor end:</a>
<a id='line_1976'>  Haste, where your trembling spouse and sire attend:</a>
<a id='line_1977'>  Haste; and a mother's care your passage shall befriend.'</a>
<a id='line_1978'>  She said, and swiftly vanish'd from my sight,</a>
<a id='line_1979'>  Obscure in clouds and gloomy shades of night.</a>
<a id='line_1980'>  I look'd, I listen'd; dreadful sounds I hear;</a>
<a id='line_1981'>  And the dire forms of hostile gods appear.</a>
<a id='line_1982'>  Troy sunk in flames I saw (nor could prevent),</a>
<a id='line_1983'>  And Ilium from its old foundations rent;</a>
<a id='line_1984'>  Rent like a mountain ash, which dar'd the winds,</a>
<a id='line_1985'>  And stood the sturdy strokes of lab'ring hinds.</a>
<a id='line_1986'>  About the roots the cruel ax resounds;</a>
<a id='line_1987'>  The stumps are pierc'd with oft-repeated wounds:</a>
<a id='line_1988'>  The war is felt on high; the nodding crown</a>
<a id='line_1989'>  Now threats a fall, and throws the leafy honors down.</a>
<a id='line_1990'>  To their united force it yields, tho' late,</a>
<a id='line_1991'>  And mourns with mortal groans th' approaching fate:</a>
<a id='line_1992'>  The roots no more their upper load sustain;</a>
<a id='line_1993'>  But down she falls, and spreads a ruin thro' the plain.</a>
<a id='line_1994'></a>
<a id='line_1995'>  "Descending thence, I scape thro' foes and fire:</a>

<a id='line_2041'>  O goddess mother, give me back to Fate;</a>

<a id='line_2070'>  Strange to relate, from young Iulus' head</a>
<a id='line_2071'>  A lambent flame arose, which gently spread</a>
<a id='line_2072'>  Around his brows, and on his temples fed.</a>

<a id='line_2074'>  To quench the sacred fire, and slake his hair;</a>
<a id='line_2075'>  But old Anchises, vers'd in omens, rear'd</a>
<a id='line_2076'>  His hands to heav'n, and this request preferr'd:</a>

<a id='line_2173'>  Driv'n on the wings of winds, whole sheets of fire,</a>
<a id='line_2174'>  Thro' air transported, to the roofs aspire.</a>
<a id='line_2175'>  From thence to Priam's palace I resort,</a>
<a id='line_2176'>  And search the citadel and desart court.</a>
<a id='line_2177'>  Then, unobserv'd, I pass by Juno's church:</a>
<a id='line_2178'>  A guard of Grecians had possess'd the porch;</a>
<a id='line_2179'>  There Phoenix and Ulysses watch prey,</a>
<a id='line_2180'>  And thither all the wealth of Troy convey:</a>
<a id='line_2181'>  The spoils which they from ransack'd houses brought,</a>
<a id='line_2182'>  And golden bowls from burning altars caught,</a>
<a id='line_2183'>  The tables of the gods, the purple vests,</a>
<a id='line_2184'>  The people's treasure, and the pomp of priests.</a>
<a id='line_2185'>  A rank of wretched youths, with pinion'd hands,</a>
<a id='line_2186'>  And captive matrons, in long order stands.</a>
<a id='line_2187'>  Then, with ungovern'd madness, I proclaim,</a>
<a id='line_2188'>  Thro' all the silent street, Creusa's name:</a>
<a id='line_2189'>  Creusa still I call; at length she hears,</a>
<a id='line_2190'>  And sudden thro' the shades of night appears-</a>
<a id='line_2191'>  Appears, no more Creusa, nor my wife,</a>
<a id='line_2192'>  But a pale specter, larger than the life.</a>
<a id='line_2193'>  Aghast, astonish'd, and struck dumb with fear,</a>
<a id='line_2194'>  I stood; like bristles rose my stiffen'd hair.</a>
<a id='line_2195'>  Then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief</a>
<a id='line_2196'>  'Nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief.</a>

<a id='line_2212'>  Th' imperious looks of some proud Grecian dame;</a>
<a id='line_2213'>  Or, stooping to the victor's lust, disgrace</a>
<a id='line_2214'>  My goddess mother, or my royal race.</a>

<a id='line_2219'>  I strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue;</a>
<a id='line_2220'>  And thrice about her neck my arms I flung,</a>

<a id='line_2222'>  Light as an empty dream at break of day,</a>

<a id='line_2276'>  A bull on Jove's imperial altar laid.</a>
<a id='line_2277'>  Not far, a rising hillock stood in view;</a>
<a id='line_2278'>  Sharp myrtles on the sides, and cornels grew.</a>
<a id='line_2279'>  There, while I went to crop the sylvan scenes,</a>
<a id='line_2280'>  And shade our altar with their leafy greens,</a>
<a id='line_2281'>  I pull'd a plant- with horror I relate</a>
<a id='line_2282'>  A prodigy so strange and full of fate.</a>
<a id='line_2283'>  The rooted fibers rose, and from the wound</a>
<a id='line_2284'>  Black bloody drops distill'd upon the ground.</a>
<a id='line_2285'>  Mute and amaz'd, my hair with terror stood;</a>
<a id='line_2286'>  Fear shrunk my sinews, and congeal'd my blood.</a>
<a id='line_2287'>  Mann'd once again, another plant I try:</a>
<a id='line_2288'>  That other gush'd with the same sanguine dye.</a>
<a id='line_2289'>  Then, fearing guilt for some offense unknown,</a>
<a id='line_2290'>  With pray'rs and vows the Dryads I atone,</a>
<a id='line_2291'>  With all the sisters of the woods, and most</a>
<a id='line_2292'>  The God of Arms, who rules the Thracian coast,</a>
<a id='line_2293'>  That they, or he, these omens would avert,</a>
<a id='line_2294'>  Release our fears, and better signs impart.</a>
<a id='line_2295'>  Clear'd, as I thought, and fully fix'd at length</a>
<a id='line_2296'>  To learn the cause, I tugged with all my strength:</a>
<a id='line_2297'>  I bent my knees against the ground; once more</a>

<a id='line_2299'>  Scarce dare I tell the sequel: from the womb</a>
<a id='line_2300'>  Of wounded earth, and caverns of the tomb,</a>
<a id='line_2301'>  A groan, as of a troubled ghost, renew'd</a>
<a id='line_2302'>  My fright, and then these dreadful words ensued:</a>
<a id='line_2303'>  'Why dost thou thus my buried body rend?</a>

<a id='line_2305'>  Spare to pollute thy pious hands with blood:</a>

<a id='line_2310'>  Warn'd by my fate; for I am Polydore!</a>
<a id='line_2311'>  Here loads of lances, in my blood embrued,</a>

<a id='line_2322'>  Who, when he saw the pow'r of Troy decline,</a>
<a id='line_2323'>  Forsook the weaker, with the strong to join;</a>
<a id='line_2324'>  Broke ev'ry bond of nature and of truth,</a>

<a id='line_2332'>  All vote to leave that execrable shore,</a>
<a id='line_2333'>  Polluted with the blood of Polydore;</a>
<a id='line_2334'>  But, ere we sail, his fun'ral rites prepare,</a>
<a id='line_2335'>  Then, to his ghost, a tomb and altars rear.</a>
<a id='line_2336'>  In mournful pomp the matrons walk the round,</a>
<a id='line_2337'>  With baleful cypress and blue fillets crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_2338'>  With eyes dejected, and with hair unbound.</a>
<a id='line_2339'>  Then bowls of tepid milk and blood we pour,</a>

<a id='line_2341'></a>
<a id='line_2342'>  "Now, when the raging storms no longer reign,</a>

<a id='line_2373'>  And from the tripos rush'd a bellowing sound.</a>
<a id='line_2374'>  Prostrate we fell; confess'd the present god,</a>
<a id='line_2375'>  Who gave this answer from his dark abode:</a>
<a id='line_2376'>  'Undaunted youths, go, seek that mother earth</a>

<a id='line_2646'>  Then solemniz'd her former husband's fate.</a>
<a id='line_2647'>  Green altars, rais'd of turf, with gifts she crown'd,</a>

<a id='line_2655'>  Forsakes her limbs; her veins no longer beat:</a>
<a id='line_2656'>  She faints, she falls, and scarce recov'ring strength,</a>
<a id='line_2657'>  Thus, with a falt'ring tongue, she speaks at length:</a>
<a id='line_2658'></a>
<a id='line_2659'>  "'Are you alive, O goddess-born?' she said,</a>
<a id='line_2660'>  'Or if a ghost, then where is Hector's shade?'</a>
<a id='line_2661'>  At this, she cast a loud and frightful cry.</a>
<a id='line_2662'>  With broken words I made this brief reply:</a>
<a id='line_2663'>  'All of me that remains appears in sight;</a>

<a id='line_2671'>  With eyes dejected, in a lowly tone,</a>
<a id='line_2672'>  After a modest pause she thus begun:</a>

<a id='line_3341'>  She longs again to hear the prince relate</a>
<a id='line_3342'>  His own adventures and the Trojan fate.</a>
<a id='line_3343'>  He tells it o'er and o'er; but still in vain,</a>
<a id='line_3344'>  For still she begs to hear it once again.</a>
<a id='line_3345'>  The hearer on the speaker's mouth depends,</a>

<a id='line_3347'></a>

<a id='line_3408'>  The fearful train shall take their speedy flight,</a>
<a id='line_3409'>  Dispers'd, and all involv'd in gloomy night;</a>
<a id='line_3410'>  One cave a grateful shelter shall afford</a>
<a id='line_3411'>  To the fair princess and the Trojan lord.</a>
<a id='line_3412'>  I will myself the bridal bed prepare,</a>
<a id='line_3413'>  If you, to bless the nuptials, will be there:</a>
<a id='line_3414'>  So shall their loves be crown'd with due delights,</a>
<a id='line_3415'>  And Hymen shall be present at the rites."</a>
<a id='line_3416'>  The Queen of Love consents, and closely smiles</a>
<a id='line_3417'>  At her vain project, and discover'd wiles.</a>
<a id='line_3418'></a>
<a id='line_3419'>  The rosy morn was risen from the main,</a>
<a id='line_3420'>  And horns and hounds awake the princely train:</a>
<a id='line_3421'>  They issue early thro' the city gate,</a>
<a id='line_3422'>  Where the more wakeful huntsmen ready wait,</a>
<a id='line_3423'>  With nets, and toils, and darts, beside the force</a>
<a id='line_3424'>  Of Spartan dogs, and swift Massylian horse.</a>
<a id='line_3425'>  The Tyrian peers and officers of state</a>
<a id='line_3426'>  For the slow queen in antechambers wait;</a>
<a id='line_3427'>  Her lofty courser, in the court below,</a>
<a id='line_3428'>  Who his majestic rider seems to know,</a>
<a id='line_3429'>  Proud of his purple trappings, paws the ground,</a>
<a id='line_3430'>  And champs the golden bit, and spreads the foam around.</a>
<a id='line_3431'>  The queen at length appears; on either hand</a>
<a id='line_3432'>  The brawny guards in martial order stand.</a>
<a id='line_3433'>  A flow'r'd simar with golden fringe she wore,</a>
<a id='line_3434'>  And at her back a golden quiver bore;</a>
<a id='line_3435'>  Her flowing hair a golden caul restrains,</a>
<a id='line_3436'>  A golden clasp the Tyrian robe sustains.</a>
<a id='line_3437'>  Then young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace,</a>
<a id='line_3438'>  Leads on the Trojan youth to view the chase.</a>
<a id='line_3439'>  But far above the rest in beauty shines</a>
<a id='line_3440'>  The great Aeneas, the troop he joins;</a>
<a id='line_3441'>  Like fair Apollo, when he leaves the frost</a>
<a id='line_3442'>  Of wint'ry Xanthus, and the Lycian coast,</a>
<a id='line_3443'>  When to his native Delos he resorts,</a>
<a id='line_3444'>  Ordains the dances, and renews the sports;</a>
<a id='line_3445'>  Where painted Scythians, mix'd with Cretan bands,</a>
<a id='line_3446'>  Before the joyful altars join their hands:</a>
<a id='line_3447'>  Himself, on Cynthus walking, sees below</a>
<a id='line_3448'>  The merry madness of the sacred show.</a>
<a id='line_3449'>  Green wreaths of bays his length of hair inclose;</a>
<a id='line_3450'>  A golden fillet binds his awful brows;</a>
<a id='line_3451'>  His quiver sounds: not less the prince is seen</a>
<a id='line_3452'>  In manly presence, or in lofty mien.</a>
<a id='line_3453'></a>
<a id='line_3454'>  Now had they reach'd the hills, and storm'd the seat</a>
<a id='line_3455'>  Of salvage beasts, in dens, their last retreat.</a>
<a id='line_3456'>  The cry pursues the mountain goats: they bound</a>
<a id='line_3457'>  From rock to rock, and keep the craggy ground;</a>
<a id='line_3458'>  Quite otherwise the stags, a trembling train,</a>
<a id='line_3459'>  In herds unsingled, scour the dusty plain,</a>
<a id='line_3460'>  And a long chase in open view maintain.</a>
<a id='line_3461'>  The glad Ascanius, as his courser guides,</a>
<a id='line_3462'>  Spurs thro' the vale, and these and those outrides.</a>
<a id='line_3463'>  His horse's flanks and sides are forc'd to feel</a>
<a id='line_3464'>  The clanking lash, and goring of the steel.</a>
<a id='line_3465'>  Impatiently he views the feeble prey,</a>
<a id='line_3466'>  Wishing some nobler beast to cross his way,</a>
<a id='line_3467'>  And rather would the tusky boar attend,</a>
<a id='line_3468'>  Or see the tawny lion downward bend.</a>
<a id='line_3469'></a>
<a id='line_3470'>  Meantime, the gath'ring clouds obscure the skies:</a>
<a id='line_3471'>  From pole to pole the forky lightning flies;</a>
<a id='line_3472'>  The rattling thunders roll; and Juno pours</a>
<a id='line_3473'>  A wintry deluge down, and sounding show'rs.</a>
<a id='line_3474'>  The company, dispers'd, to converts ride,</a>
<a id='line_3475'>  And seek the homely cots, or mountain's hollow side.</a>
<a id='line_3476'>  The rapid rains, descending from the hills,</a>
<a id='line_3477'>  To rolling torrents raise the creeping rills.</a>
<a id='line_3478'>  The queen and prince, as love or fortune guides,</a>
<a id='line_3479'>  One common cavern in her bosom hides.</a>
<a id='line_3480'>  Then first the trembling earth the signal gave,</a>
<a id='line_3481'>  And flashing fires enlighten all the cave;</a>
<a id='line_3482'>  Hell from below, and Juno from above,</a>
<a id='line_3483'>  And howling nymphs, were conscious of their love.</a>
<a id='line_3484'>  From this ill-omen'd hour in time arose</a>
<a id='line_3485'>  Debate and death, and all succeeding woes.</a>
<a id='line_3486'></a>
<a id='line_3487'>  The queen, whom sense of honor could not move,</a>
<a id='line_3488'>  No longer made a secret of her love,</a>
<a id='line_3489'>  But call'd it marriage, by that specious name</a>
<a id='line_3490'>  To veil the crime and sanctify the shame.</a>
<a id='line_3491'></a>
<a id='line_3492'>  The loud report thro' Libyan cities goes.</a>
<a id='line_3493'>  Fame, the great ill, from small beginnings grows:</a>
<a id='line_3494'>  Swift from the first; and ev'ry moment brings</a>
<a id='line_3495'>  New vigor to her flights, new pinions to her wings.</a>
<a id='line_3496'>  Soon grows the pigmy to gigantic size;</a>
<a id='line_3497'>  Her feet on earth, her forehead in the skies.</a>
<a id='line_3498'>  Inrag'd against the gods, revengeful Earth</a>
<a id='line_3499'>  Produc'd her last of the Titanian birth.</a>
<a id='line_3500'>  Swift is her walk, more swift her winged haste:</a>
<a id='line_3501'>  A monstrous phantom, horrible and vast.</a>
<a id='line_3502'>  As many plumes as raise her lofty flight,</a>
<a id='line_3503'>  So many piercing eyes inlarge her sight;</a>
<a id='line_3504'>  Millions of opening mouths to Fame belong,</a>
<a id='line_3505'>  And ev'ry mouth is furnish'd with a tongue,</a>
<a id='line_3506'>  And round with list'ning ears the flying plague is hung.</a>
<a id='line_3507'>  She fills the peaceful universe with cries;</a>
<a id='line_3508'>  No slumbers ever close her wakeful eyes;</a>
<a id='line_3509'>  By day, from lofty tow'rs her head she shews,</a>
<a id='line_3510'>  And spreads thro' trembling crowds disastrous news;</a>
<a id='line_3511'>  With court informers haunts, and royal spies;</a>
<a id='line_3512'>  Things done relates, not done she feigns, and mingles truth with lies.</a>
<a id='line_3513'></a>
<a id='line_3514'>  Talk is her business, and her chief delight</a>
<a id='line_3515'>  To tell of prodigies and cause affright.</a>
<a id='line_3516'>  She fills the people's ears with Dido's name,</a>
<a id='line_3517'>  Who, lost to honor and the sense of shame,</a>
<a id='line_3518'>  Admits into her throne and nuptial bed</a>
<a id='line_3519'>  A wand'ring guest, who from his country fled:</a>
<a id='line_3520'>  Whole days with him she passes in delights,</a>
<a id='line_3521'>  And wastes in luxury long winter nights,</a>
<a id='line_3522'>  Forgetful of her fame and royal trust,</a>
<a id='line_3523'>  Dissolv'd in ease, abandon'd to her lust.</a>
<a id='line_3524'></a>
<a id='line_3525'>  The goddess widely spreads the loud report,</a>
<a id='line_3526'>  And flies at length to King Hyarba's court.</a>
<a id='line_3527'>  When first possess'd with this unwelcome news</a>
<a id='line_3528'>  Whom did he not of men and gods accuse?</a>
<a id='line_3529'>  This prince, from ravish'd Garamantis born,</a>
<a id='line_3530'>  A hundred temples did with spoils adorn,</a>
<a id='line_3531'>  In Ammon's honor, his celestial sire;</a>
<a id='line_3532'>  A hundred altars fed with wakeful fire;</a>
<a id='line_3533'>  And, thro' his vast dominions, priests ordain'd,</a>
<a id='line_3534'>  Whose watchful care these holy rites maintain'd.</a>
<a id='line_3535'>  The gates and columns were with garlands crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_3536'>  And blood of victim beasts enrich'd the ground.</a>
<a id='line_3537'></a>
<a id='line_3538'>  He, when he heard a fugitive could move</a>
<a id='line_3539'>  The Tyrian princess, who disdain'd his love,</a>
<a id='line_3540'>  His breast with fury burn'd, his eyes with fire,</a>
<a id='line_3541'>  Mad with despair, impatient with desire;</a>
<a id='line_3542'>  Then on the sacred altars pouring wine,</a>
<a id='line_3543'>  He thus with pray'rs implor'd his sire divine:</a>
<a id='line_3544'>  "Great Jove! propitious to the Moorish race,</a>
<a id='line_3545'>  Who feast on painted beds, with off'rings grace</a>
<a id='line_3546'>  Thy temples, and adore thy pow'r divine</a>
<a id='line_3547'>  With blood of victims, and with sparkling wine,</a>
<a id='line_3548'>  Seest thou not this? or do we fear in vain</a>
<a id='line_3549'>  Thy boasted thunder, and thy thoughtless reign?</a>
<a id='line_3550'>  Do thy broad hands the forky lightnings lance?</a>
<a id='line_3551'>  Thine are the bolts, or the blind work of chance?</a>
<a id='line_3552'>  A wand'ring woman builds, within our state,</a>
<a id='line_3553'>  A little town, bought at an easy rate;</a>
<a id='line_3554'>  She pays me homage, and my grants allow</a>
<a id='line_3555'>  A narrow space of Libyan lands to plow;</a>
<a id='line_3556'>  Yet, scorning me, by passion blindly led,</a>
<a id='line_3557'>  Admits a banish'd Trojan to her bed!</a>
<a id='line_3558'>  And now this other Paris, with his train</a>
<a id='line_3559'>  Of conquer'd cowards, must in Afric reign!</a>
<a id='line_3560'>  (Whom, what they are, their looks and garb confess,</a>
<a id='line_3561'>  Their locks with oil perfum'd, their Lydian dress.)</a>
<a id='line_3562'>  He takes the spoil, enjoys the princely dame;</a>
<a id='line_3563'>  And I, rejected I, adore an empty name."</a>
<a id='line_3564'></a>
<a id='line_3565'>  His vows, in haughty terms, he thus preferr'd,</a>
<a id='line_3566'>  And held his altar's horns. The mighty Thund'rer heard;</a>
<a id='line_3567'>  Then cast his eyes on Carthage, where he found</a>
<a id='line_3568'>  The lustful pair in lawless pleasure drown'd,</a>
<a id='line_3569'>  Lost in their loves, insensible of shame,</a>
<a id='line_3570'>  And both forgetful of their better fame.</a>
<a id='line_3571'>  He calls Cyllenius, and the god attends,</a>
<a id='line_3572'>  By whom his menacing command he sends:</a>
<a id='line_3573'>  "Go, mount the western winds, and cleave the sky;</a>
<a id='line_3574'>  Then, with a swift descent, to Carthage fly:</a>
<a id='line_3575'>  There find the Trojan chief, who wastes his days</a>
<a id='line_3576'>  In slothful riot and inglorious ease,</a>
<a id='line_3577'>  Nor minds the future city, giv'n by fate.</a>
<a id='line_3578'>  To him this message from my mouth relate:</a>
<a id='line_3579'>  'Not so fair Venus hop'd, when twice she won</a>
<a id='line_3580'>  Thy life with pray'rs, nor promis'd such a son.</a>
<a id='line_3581'>  Hers was a hero, destin'd to command</a>
<a id='line_3582'>  A martial race, and rule the Latian land,</a>
<a id='line_3583'>  Who should his ancient line from Teucer draw,</a>
<a id='line_3584'>  And on the conquer'd world impose the law.'</a>
<a id='line_3585'>  If glory cannot move a mind so mean,</a>
<a id='line_3586'>  Nor future praise from fading pleasure wean,</a>
<a id='line_3587'>  Yet why should he defraud his son of fame,</a>
<a id='line_3588'>  And grudge the Romans their immortal name!</a>
<a id='line_3589'>  What are his vain designs! what hopes he more</a>
<a id='line_3590'>  From his long ling'ring on a hostile shore,</a>
<a id='line_3591'>  Regardless to redeem his honor lost,</a>
<a id='line_3592'>  And for his race to gain th' Ausonian coast!</a>
<a id='line_3593'>  Bid him with speed the Tyrian court forsake;</a>
<a id='line_3594'>  With this command the slumb'ring warrior wake."</a>
<a id='line_3595'></a>
<a id='line_3596'>  Hermes obeys; with golden pinions binds</a>
<a id='line_3597'>  His flying feet, and mounts the western winds:</a>
<a id='line_3598'>  And, whether o'er the seas or earth he flies,</a>
<a id='line_3599'>  With rapid force they bear him down the skies.</a>
<a id='line_3600'>  But first he grasps within his awful hand</a>
<a id='line_3601'>  The mark of sov'reign pow'r, his magic wand;</a>
<a id='line_3602'>  With this he draws the ghosts from hollow graves;</a>
<a id='line_3603'>  With this he drives them down the Stygian waves;</a>
<a id='line_3604'>  With this he seals in sleep the wakeful sight,</a>
<a id='line_3605'>  And eyes, tho' clos'd in death, restores to light.</a>
<a id='line_3606'>  Thus arm'd, the god begins his airy race,</a>
<a id='line_3607'>  And drives the racking clouds along the liquid space;</a>
<a id='line_3608'>  Now sees the tops of Atlas, as he flies,</a>
<a id='line_3609'>  Whose brawny back supports the starry skies;</a>
<a id='line_3610'>  Atlas, whose head, with piny forests crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_3611'>  Is beaten by the winds, with foggy vapors bound.</a>
<a id='line_3612'>  Snows hide his shoulders; from beneath his chin</a>
<a id='line_3613'>  The founts of rolling streams their race begin;</a>
<a id='line_3614'>  A beard of ice on his large breast depends.</a>
<a id='line_3615'>  Here, pois'd upon his wings, the god descends:</a>
<a id='line_3616'>  Then, rested thus, he from the tow'ring height</a>
<a id='line_3617'>  Plung'd downward, with precipitated flight,</a>
<a id='line_3618'>  Lights on the seas, and skims along the flood.</a>
<a id='line_3619'>  As waterfowl, who seek their fishy food,</a>
<a id='line_3620'>  Less, and yet less, to distant prospect show;</a>
<a id='line_3621'>  By turns they dance aloft, and dive below:</a>
<a id='line_3622'>  Like these, the steerage of his wings he plies,</a>
<a id='line_3623'>  And near the surface of the water flies,</a>
<a id='line_3624'>  Till, having pass'd the seas, and cross'd the sands,</a>
<a id='line_3625'>  He clos'd his wings, and stoop'd on Libyan lands:</a>
<a id='line_3626'>  Where shepherds once were hous'd in homely sheds,</a>
<a id='line_3627'>  Now tow'rs within the clouds advance their heads.</a>
<a id='line_3628'>  Arriving there, he found the Trojan prince</a>
<a id='line_3629'>  New ramparts raising for the town's defense.</a>
<a id='line_3630'>  A purple scarf, with gold embroider'd o'er,</a>
<a id='line_3631'>  (Queen Dido's gift,) about his waist he wore;</a>
<a id='line_3632'>  A sword, with glitt'ring gems diversified,</a>
<a id='line_3633'>  For ornament, not use, hung idly by his side.</a>
<a id='line_3634'></a>
<a id='line_3635'>  Then thus, with winged words, the god began,</a>
<a id='line_3636'>  Resuming his own shape: "Degenerate man,</a>
<a id='line_3637'>  Thou woman's property, what mak'st thou here,</a>
<a id='line_3638'>  These foreign walls and Tyrian tow'rs to rear,</a>
<a id='line_3639'>  Forgetful of thy own? All-pow'rful Jove,</a>
<a id='line_3640'>  Who sways the world below and heav'n above,</a>
<a id='line_3641'>  Has sent me down with this severe command:</a>
<a id='line_3642'>  What means thy ling'ring in the Libyan land?</a>
<a id='line_3643'>  If glory cannot move a mind so mean,</a>
<a id='line_3644'>  Nor future praise from flitting pleasure wean,</a>
<a id='line_3645'>  Regard the fortunes of thy rising heir:</a>
<a id='line_3646'>  The promis'd crown let young Ascanius wear,</a>
<a id='line_3647'>  To whom th' Ausonian scepter, and the state</a>
<a id='line_3648'>  Of Rome's imperial name is ow'd by fate."</a>
<a id='line_3649'>  So spoke the god; and, speaking, took his flight,</a>
<a id='line_3650'>  Involv'd in clouds, and vanish'd out of sight.</a>
<a id='line_3651'></a>
<a id='line_3652'>  The pious prince was seiz'd with sudden fear;</a>
<a id='line_3653'>  Mute was his tongue, and upright stood his hair.</a>
<a id='line_3654'>  Revolving in his mind the stern command,</a>
<a id='line_3655'>  He longs to fly, and loathes the charming land.</a>
<a id='line_3656'>  What should he say? or how should he begin?</a>
<a id='line_3657'>  What course, alas! remains to steer between</a>
<a id='line_3658'>  Th' offended lover and the pow'rful queen?</a>
<a id='line_3659'>  This way and that he turns his anxious mind,</a>
<a id='line_3660'>  And all expedients tries, and none can find.</a>
<a id='line_3661'>  Fix'd on the deed, but doubtful of the means,</a>
<a id='line_3662'>  After long thought, to this advice he leans:</a>
<a id='line_3663'>  Three chiefs he calls, commands them to repair</a>
<a id='line_3664'>  The fleet, and ship their men with silent care;</a>
<a id='line_3665'>  Some plausible pretense he bids them find,</a>
<a id='line_3666'>  To color what in secret he design'd.</a>
<a id='line_3667'>  Himself, meantime, the softest hours would choose,</a>
<a id='line_3668'>  Before the love-sick lady heard the news;</a>
<a id='line_3669'>  And move her tender mind, by slow degrees,</a>
<a id='line_3670'>  To suffer what the sov'reign pow'r decrees:</a>
<a id='line_3671'>  Jove will inspire him, when, and what to say.</a>
<a id='line_3672'>  They hear with pleasure, and with haste obey.</a>
<a id='line_3673'></a>
<a id='line_3674'>  But soon the queen perceives the thin disguise:</a>
<a id='line_3675'>  (What arts can blind a jealous woman's eyes!)</a>
<a id='line_3676'>  She was the first to find the secret fraud,</a>
<a id='line_3677'>  Before the fatal news was blaz'd abroad.</a>
<a id='line_3678'>  Love the first motions of the lover hears,</a>
<a id='line_3679'>  Quick to presage, and ev'n in safety fears.</a>
<a id='line_3680'>  Nor impious Fame was wanting to report</a>
<a id='line_3681'>  The ships repair'd, the Trojans' thick resort,</a>
<a id='line_3682'>  And purpose to forsake the Tyrian court.</a>
<a id='line_3683'>  Frantic with fear, impatient of the wound,</a>
<a id='line_3684'>  And impotent of mind, she roves the city round.</a>
<a id='line_3685'>  Less wild the Bacchanalian dames appear,</a>
<a id='line_3686'>  When, from afar, their nightly god they hear,</a>
<a id='line_3687'>  And howl about the hills, and shake the wreathy spear.</a>
<a id='line_3688'>  At length she finds the dear perfidious man;</a>
<a id='line_3689'>  Prevents his form'd excuse, and thus began:</a>
<a id='line_3690'>  "Base and ungrateful! could you hope to fly,</a>
<a id='line_3691'>  And undiscover'd scape a lover's eye?</a>
<a id='line_3692'>  Nor could my kindness your compassion move.</a>
<a id='line_3693'>  Nor plighted vows, nor dearer bands of love?</a>
<a id='line_3694'>  Or is the death of a despairing queen</a>
<a id='line_3695'>  Not worth preventing, tho' too well foreseen?</a>
<a id='line_3696'>  Ev'n when the wintry winds command your stay,</a>
<a id='line_3697'>  You dare the tempests, and defy the sea.</a>
<a id='line_3698'>  False as you are, suppose you were not bound</a>
<a id='line_3699'>  To lands unknown, and foreign coasts to sound;</a>
<a id='line_3700'>  Were Troy restor'd, and Priam's happy reign,</a>
<a id='line_3701'>  Now durst you tempt, for Troy, the raging main?</a>
<a id='line_3702'>  See whom you fly! am I the foe you shun?</a>
<a id='line_3703'>  Now, by those holy vows, so late begun,</a>
<a id='line_3704'>  By this right hand, (since I have nothing more</a>
<a id='line_3705'>  To challenge, but the faith you gave before;)</a>
<a id='line_3706'>  I beg you by these tears too truly shed,</a>
<a id='line_3707'>  By the new pleasures of our nuptial bed;</a>
<a id='line_3708'>  If ever Dido, when you most were kind,</a>
<a id='line_3709'>  Were pleasing in your eyes, or touch'd your mind;</a>
<a id='line_3710'>  By these my pray'rs, if pray'rs may yet have place,</a>
<a id='line_3711'>  Pity the fortunes of a falling race.</a>
<a id='line_3712'>  For you I have provok'd a tyrant's hate,</a>
<a id='line_3713'>  Incens'd the Libyan and the Tyrian state;</a>
<a id='line_3714'>  For you alone I suffer in my fame,</a>
<a id='line_3715'>  Bereft of honor, and expos'd to shame.</a>
<a id='line_3716'>  Whom have I now to trust, ungrateful guest?</a>
<a id='line_3717'>  (That only name remains of all the rest!)</a>
<a id='line_3718'>  What have I left? or whither can I fly?</a>
<a id='line_3719'>  Must I attend Pygmalion's cruelty,</a>
<a id='line_3720'>  Or till Hyarba shall in triumph lead</a>
<a id='line_3721'>  A queen that proudly scorn'd his proffer'd bed?</a>
<a id='line_3722'>  Had you deferr'd, at least, your hasty flight,</a>
<a id='line_3723'>  And left behind some pledge of our delight,</a>
<a id='line_3724'>  Some babe to bless the mother's mournful sight,</a>
<a id='line_3725'>  Some young Aeneas, to supply your place,</a>
<a id='line_3726'>  Whose features might express his father's face;</a>
<a id='line_3727'>  I should not then complain to live bereft</a>
<a id='line_3728'>  Of all my husband, or be wholly left."</a>
<a id='line_3729'></a>
<a id='line_3730'>  Here paus'd the queen. Unmov'd he holds his eyes,</a>
<a id='line_3731'>  By Jove's command; nor suffer'd love to rise,</a>
<a id='line_3732'>  Tho' heaving in his heart; and thus at length replies:</a>
<a id='line_3733'>  "Fair queen, you never can enough repeat</a>
<a id='line_3734'>  Your boundless favors, or I own my debt;</a>
<a id='line_3735'>  Nor can my mind forget Eliza's name,</a>
<a id='line_3736'>  While vital breath inspires this mortal frame.</a>
<a id='line_3737'>  This only let me speak in my defense:</a>
<a id='line_3738'>  I never hop'd a secret flight from hence,</a>
<a id='line_3739'>  Much less pretended to the lawful claim</a>
<a id='line_3740'>  Of sacred nuptials, or a husband's name.</a>
<a id='line_3741'>  For, if indulgent Heav'n would leave me free,</a>
<a id='line_3742'>  And not submit my life to fate's decree,</a>
<a id='line_3743'>  My choice would lead me to the Trojan shore,</a>
<a id='line_3744'>  Those relics to review, their dust adore,</a>
<a id='line_3745'>  And Priam's ruin'd palace to restore.</a>
<a id='line_3746'>  But now the Delphian oracle commands,</a>
<a id='line_3747'>  And fate invites me to the Latian lands.</a>
<a id='line_3748'>  That is the promis'd place to which I steer,</a>
<a id='line_3749'>  And all my vows are terminated there.</a>
<a id='line_3750'>  If you, a Tyrian, and a stranger born,</a>
<a id='line_3751'>  With walls and tow'rs a Libyan town adorn,</a>
<a id='line_3752'>  Why may not we- like you, a foreign race-</a>
<a id='line_3753'>  Like you, seek shelter in a foreign place?</a>
<a id='line_3754'>  As often as the night obscures the skies</a>
<a id='line_3755'>  With humid shades, or twinkling stars arise,</a>
<a id='line_3756'>  Anchises' angry ghost in dreams appears,</a>
<a id='line_3757'>  Chides my delay, and fills my soul with fears;</a>
<a id='line_3758'>  And young Ascanius justly may complain</a>
<a id='line_3759'>  Of his defrauded and destin'd reign.</a>
<a id='line_3760'>  Ev'n now the herald of the gods appear'd:</a>
<a id='line_3761'>  Waking I saw him, and his message heard.</a>
<a id='line_3762'>  From Jove he came commission'd, heav'nly bright</a>
<a id='line_3763'>  With radiant beams, and manifest to sight</a>
<a id='line_3764'>  (The sender and the sent I both attest)</a>
<a id='line_3765'>  These walls he enter'd, and those words express'd.</a>
<a id='line_3766'>  Fair queen, oppose not what the gods command;</a>
<a id='line_3767'>  Forc'd by my fate, I leave your happy land."</a>
<a id='line_3768'></a>
<a id='line_3769'>  Thus while he spoke, already she began,</a>
<a id='line_3770'>  With sparkling eyes, to view the guilty man;</a>
<a id='line_3771'>  From head to foot survey'd his person o'er,</a>
<a id='line_3772'>  Nor longer these outrageous threats forebore:</a>
<a id='line_3773'>  "False as thou art, and, more than false, forsworn!</a>
<a id='line_3774'>  Not sprung from noble blood, nor goddess-born,</a>
<a id='line_3775'>  But hewn from harden'd entrails of a rock!</a>
<a id='line_3776'>  And rough Hyrcanian tigers gave thee suck!</a>
<a id='line_3777'>  Why should I fawn? what have I worse to fear?</a>
<a id='line_3778'>  Did he once look, or lent a list'ning ear,</a>
<a id='line_3779'>  Sigh'd when I sobb'd, or shed one kindly tear?-</a>
<a id='line_3780'>  All symptoms of a base ungrateful mind,</a>
<a id='line_3781'>  So foul, that, which is worse, 'tis hard to find.</a>
<a id='line_3782'>  Of man's injustice why should I complain?</a>
<a id='line_3783'>  The gods, and Jove himself, behold in vain</a>
<a id='line_3784'>  Triumphant treason; yet no thunder flies,</a>
<a id='line_3785'>  Nor Juno views my wrongs with equal eyes;</a>
<a id='line_3786'>  Faithless is earth, and faithless are the skies!</a>
<a id='line_3787'>  Justice is fled, and Truth is now no more!</a>
<a id='line_3788'>  I sav'd the shipwrack'd exile on my shore;</a>
<a id='line_3789'>  With needful food his hungry Trojans fed;</a>
<a id='line_3790'>  I took the traitor to my throne and bed:</a>
<a id='line_3791'>  Fool that I was- 't is little to repeat</a>
<a id='line_3792'>  The rest- I stor'd and rigg'd his ruin'd fleet.</a>
<a id='line_3793'>  I rave, I rave! A god's command he pleads,</a>
<a id='line_3794'>  And makes Heav'n accessary to his deeds.</a>
<a id='line_3795'>  Now Lycian lots, and now the Delian god,</a>
<a id='line_3796'>  Now Hermes is employ'd from Jove's abode,</a>
<a id='line_3797'>  To warn him hence; as if the peaceful state</a>
<a id='line_3798'>  Of heav'nly pow'rs were touch'd with human fate!</a>
<a id='line_3799'>  But go! thy flight no longer I detain-</a>
<a id='line_3800'>  Go seek thy promis'd kingdom thro' the main!</a>
<a id='line_3801'>  Yet, if the heav'ns will hear my pious vow,</a>
<a id='line_3802'>  The faithless waves, not half so false as thou,</a>
<a id='line_3803'>  Or secret sands, shall sepulchers afford</a>
<a id='line_3804'>  To thy proud vessels, and their perjur'd lord.</a>
<a id='line_3805'>  Then shalt thou call on injur'd Dido's name:</a>
<a id='line_3806'>  Dido shall come in a black sulph'ry flame,</a>
<a id='line_3807'>  When death has once dissolv'd her mortal frame;</a>
<a id='line_3808'>  Shall smile to see the traitor vainly weep:</a>
<a id='line_3809'>  Her angry ghost, arising from the deep,</a>
<a id='line_3810'>  Shall haunt thee waking, and disturb thy sleep.</a>
<a id='line_3811'>  At least my shade thy punishment shall know,</a>
<a id='line_3812'>  And Fame shall spread the pleasing news below."</a>
<a id='line_3813'></a>
<a id='line_3814'>  Abruptly here she stops; then turns away</a>
<a id='line_3815'>  Her loathing eyes, and shuns the sight of day.</a>
<a id='line_3816'>  Amaz'd he stood, revolving in his mind</a>
<a id='line_3817'>  What speech to frame, and what excuse to find.</a>
<a id='line_3818'>  Her fearful maids their fainting mistress led,</a>
<a id='line_3819'>  And softly laid her on her ivory bed.</a>
<a id='line_3820'></a>
<a id='line_3821'>  But good Aeneas, tho' he much desir'd</a>
<a id='line_3822'>  To give that pity which her grief requir'd;</a>
<a id='line_3823'>  Tho' much he mourn'd, and labor'd with his love,</a>
<a id='line_3824'>  Resolv'd at length, obeys the will of Jove;</a>
<a id='line_3825'>  Reviews his forces: they with early care</a>
<a id='line_3826'>  Unmoor their vessels, and for sea prepare.</a>
<a id='line_3827'>  The fleet is soon afloat, in all its pride,</a>
<a id='line_3828'>  And well-calk'd galleys in the harbor ride.</a>
<a id='line_3829'>  Then oaks for oars they fell'd; or, as they stood,</a>
<a id='line_3830'>  Of its green arms despoil'd the growing wood,</a>
<a id='line_3831'>  Studious of flight. The beach is cover'd o'er</a>
<a id='line_3832'>  With Trojan bands, that blacken all the shore:</a>
<a id='line_3833'>  On ev'ry side are seen, descending down,</a>
<a id='line_3834'>  Thick swarms of soldiers, loaden from the town.</a>
<a id='line_3835'>  Thus, in battalia, march embodied ants,</a>
<a id='line_3836'>  Fearful of winter, and of future wants,</a>
<a id='line_3837'>  T' invade the corn, and to their cells convey</a>
<a id='line_3838'>  The plunder'd forage of their yellow prey.</a>
<a id='line_3839'>  The sable troops, along the narrow tracks,</a>
<a id='line_3840'>  Scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs:</a>
<a id='line_3841'>  Some set their shoulders to the pond'rous grain;</a>
<a id='line_3842'>  Some guard the spoil; some lash the lagging train;</a>
<a id='line_3843'>  All ply their sev'ral tasks, and equal toil sustain.</a>
<a id='line_3844'></a>
<a id='line_3845'>  What pangs the tender breast of Dido tore,</a>
<a id='line_3846'>  When, from the tow'r, she saw the cover'd shore,</a>
<a id='line_3847'>  And heard the shouts of sailors from afar,</a>
<a id='line_3848'>  Mix'd with the murmurs of the wat'ry war!</a>
<a id='line_3849'>  All-pow'rful Love! what changes canst thou cause</a>
<a id='line_3850'>  In human hearts, subjected to thy laws!</a>
<a id='line_3851'>  Once more her haughty soul the tyrant bends:</a>
<a id='line_3852'>  To pray'rs and mean submissions she descends.</a>
<a id='line_3853'>  No female arts or aids she left untried,</a>
<a id='line_3854'>  Nor counsels unexplor'd, before she died.</a>
<a id='line_3855'>  "Look, Anna! look! the Trojans crowd to sea;</a>
<a id='line_3856'>  They spread their canvas, and their anchors weigh.</a>
<a id='line_3857'>  The shouting crew their ships with garlands bind,</a>
<a id='line_3858'>  Invoke the sea gods, and invite the wind.</a>
<a id='line_3859'>  Could I have thought this threat'ning blow so near,</a>
<a id='line_3860'>  My tender soul had been forewarn'd to bear.</a>
<a id='line_3861'>  But do not you my last request deny;</a>
<a id='line_3862'>  With yon perfidious man your int'rest try,</a>
<a id='line_3863'>  And bring me news, if I must live or die.</a>
<a id='line_3864'>  You are his fav'rite; you alone can find</a>
<a id='line_3865'>  The dark recesses of his inmost mind:</a>
<a id='line_3866'>  In all his trusted secrets you have part,</a>
<a id='line_3867'>  And know the soft approaches to his heart.</a>
<a id='line_3868'>  Haste then, and humbly seek my haughty foe;</a>
<a id='line_3869'>  Tell him, I did not with the Grecians go,</a>
<a id='line_3870'>  Nor did my fleet against his friends employ,</a>
<a id='line_3871'>  Nor swore the ruin of unhappy Troy,</a>
<a id='line_3872'>  Nor mov'd with hands profane his father's dust:</a>
<a id='line_3873'>  Why should he then reject a suit so just!</a>
<a id='line_3874'>  Whom does he shun, and whither would he fly!</a>
<a id='line_3875'>  Can he this last, this only pray'r deny!</a>
<a id='line_3876'>  Let him at least his dang'rous flight delay,</a>
<a id='line_3877'>  Wait better winds, and hope a calmer sea.</a>
<a id='line_3878'>  The nuptials he disclaims I urge no more:</a>
<a id='line_3879'>  Let him pursue the promis'd Latian shore.</a>
<a id='line_3880'>  A short delay is all I ask him now;</a>
<a id='line_3881'>  A pause of grief, an interval from woe,</a>
<a id='line_3882'>  Till my soft soul be temper'd to sustain</a>
<a id='line_3883'>  Accustom'd sorrows, and inur'd to pain.</a>
<a id='line_3884'>  If you in pity grant this one request,</a>
<a id='line_3885'>  My death shall glut the hatred of his breast."</a>
<a id='line_3886'>  This mournful message pious Anna bears,</a>
<a id='line_3887'>  And seconds with her own her sister's tears:</a>
<a id='line_3888'>  But all her arts are still employ'd in vain;</a>
<a id='line_3889'>  Again she comes, and is refus'd again.</a>
<a id='line_3890'>  His harden'd heart nor pray'rs nor threat'nings move;</a>
<a id='line_3891'>  Fate, and the god, had stopp'd his ears to love.</a>
<a id='line_3892'></a>
<a id='line_3893'>  As, when the winds their airy quarrel try,</a>
<a id='line_3894'>  Justling from ev'ry quarter of the sky,</a>
<a id='line_3895'>  This way and that the mountain oak they bend,</a>
<a id='line_3896'>  His boughs they shatter, and his branches rend;</a>
<a id='line_3897'>  With leaves and falling mast they spread the ground;</a>
<a id='line_3898'>  The hollow valleys echo to the sound:</a>
<a id='line_3899'>  Unmov'd, the royal plant their fury mocks,</a>
<a id='line_3900'>  Or, shaken, clings more closely to the rocks;</a>
<a id='line_3901'>  Far as he shoots his tow'ring head on high,</a>
<a id='line_3902'>  So deep in earth his fix'd foundations lie.</a>
<a id='line_3903'>  No less a storm the Trojan hero bears;</a>
<a id='line_3904'>  Thick messages and loud complaints he hears,</a>
<a id='line_3905'>  And bandied words, still beating on his ears.</a>
<a id='line_3906'>  Sighs, groans, and tears proclaim his inward pains;</a>
<a id='line_3907'>  But the firm purpose of his heart remains.</a>
<a id='line_3908'></a>
<a id='line_3909'>  The wretched queen, pursued by cruel fate,</a>
<a id='line_3910'>  Begins at length the light of heav'n to hate,</a>
<a id='line_3911'>  And loathes to live. Then dire portents she sees,</a>
<a id='line_3912'>  To hasten on the death her soul decrees:</a>
<a id='line_3913'>  Strange to relate! for when, before the shrine,</a>
<a id='line_3914'>  She pours in sacrifice the purple wine,</a>
<a id='line_3915'>  The purple wine is turn'd to putrid blood,</a>
<a id='line_3916'>  And the white offer'd milk converts to mud.</a>
<a id='line_3917'>  This dire presage, to her alone reveal'd,</a>
<a id='line_3918'>  From all, and ev'n her sister, she conceal'd.</a>
<a id='line_3919'>  A marble temple stood within the grove,</a>
<a id='line_3920'>  Sacred to death, and to her murther'd love;</a>
<a id='line_3921'>  That honor'd chapel she had hung around</a>
<a id='line_3922'>  With snowy fleeces, and with garlands crown'd:</a>
<a id='line_3923'>  Oft, when she visited this lonely dome,</a>
<a id='line_3924'>  Strange voices issued from her husband's tomb;</a>
<a id='line_3925'>  She thought she heard him summon her away,</a>
<a id='line_3926'>  Invite her to his grave, and chide her stay.</a>
<a id='line_3927'>  Hourly 't is heard, when with a boding note</a>
<a id='line_3928'>  The solitary screech owl strains her throat,</a>
<a id='line_3929'>  And, on a chimney's top, or turret's height,</a>
<a id='line_3930'>  With songs obscene disturbs the silence of the night.</a>
<a id='line_3931'>  Besides, old prophecies augment her fears;</a>
<a id='line_3932'>  And stern Aeneas in her dreams appears,</a>
<a id='line_3933'>  Disdainful as by day: she seems, alone,</a>
<a id='line_3934'>  To wander in her sleep, thro' ways unknown,</a>
<a id='line_3935'>  Guideless and dark; or, in a desart plain,</a>
<a id='line_3936'>  To seek her subjects, and to seek in vain:</a>
<a id='line_3937'>  Like Pentheus, when, distracted with his fear,</a>
<a id='line_3938'>  He saw two suns, and double Thebes, appear;</a>
<a id='line_3939'>  Or mad Orestes, when his mother's ghost</a>
<a id='line_3940'>  Full in his face infernal torches toss'd,</a>
<a id='line_3941'>  And shook her snaky locks: he shuns the sight,</a>
<a id='line_3942'>  Flies o'er the stage, surpris'd with mortal fright;</a>
<a id='line_3943'>  The Furies guard the door and intercept his flight.</a>
<a id='line_3944'></a>
<a id='line_3945'>  Now, sinking underneath a load of grief,</a>
<a id='line_3946'>  From death alone she seeks her last relief;</a>
<a id='line_3947'>  The time and means resolv'd within her breast,</a>
<a id='line_3948'>  She to her mournful sister thus address'd</a>
<a id='line_3949'>  (Dissembling hope, her cloudy front she clears,</a>
<a id='line_3950'>  And a false vigor in her eyes appears):</a>
<a id='line_3951'>  "Rejoice!" she said. "Instructed from above,</a>
<a id='line_3952'>  My lover I shall gain, or lose my love.</a>
<a id='line_3953'>  Nigh rising Atlas, next the falling sun,</a>

<a id='line_3961'>  She watch'd the golden fruit; her charms unbind</a>
<a id='line_3962'>  The chains of love, or fix them on the mind:</a>
<a id='line_3963'>  She stops the torrents, leaves the channel dry,</a>
<a id='line_3964'>  Repels the stars, and backward bears the sky.</a>
<a id='line_3965'>  The yawning earth rebellows to her call,</a>
<a id='line_3966'>  Pale ghosts ascend, and mountain ashes fall.</a>
<a id='line_3967'>  Witness, ye gods, and thou my better part,</a>

<a id='line_3977'></a>
<a id='line_3978'>  Thus far she said, and farther speech forbears;</a>
<a id='line_3979'>  A mortal paleness in her face appears:</a>
<a id='line_3980'>  Yet the mistrustless Anna could not find</a>
<a id='line_3981'>  The secret fun'ral in these rites design'd;</a>
<a id='line_3982'>  Nor thought so dire a rage possess'd her mind.</a>
<a id='line_3983'>  Unknowing of a train conceal'd so well,</a>
<a id='line_3984'>  She fear'd no worse than when Sichaeus fell;</a>
<a id='line_3985'>  Therefore obeys. The fatal pile they rear,</a>
<a id='line_3986'>  Within the secret court, expos'd in air.</a>
<a id='line_3987'>  The cloven holms and pines are heap'd on high,</a>

<a id='line_3991'>  The queen, determin'd to the fatal deed,</a>

<a id='line_4021'>  The stars in silent order mov'd around;</a>
<a id='line_4022'>  And Peace, with downy wings, was brooding on the ground</a>
<a id='line_4023'>  The flocks and herds, and party-color'd fowl,</a>
<a id='line_4024'>  Which haunt the woods, or swim the weedy pool,</a>
<a id='line_4025'>  Stretch'd on the quiet earth, securely lay,</a>
<a id='line_4026'>  Forgetting the past labors of the day.</a>
<a id='line_4027'>  All else of nature's common gift partake:</a>
<a id='line_4028'>  Unhappy Dido was alone awake.</a>
<a id='line_4029'>  Nor sleep nor ease the furious queen can find;</a>
<a id='line_4030'>  Sleep fled her eyes, as quiet fled her mind.</a>
<a id='line_4031'>  Despair, and rage, and love divide her heart;</a>
<a id='line_4032'>  Despair and rage had some, but love the greater part.</a>
<a id='line_4033'></a>
<a id='line_4034'>  Then thus she said within her secret mind:</a>
<a id='line_4035'>  "What shall I do? what succor can I find?</a>
<a id='line_4036'>  Become a suppliant to Hyarba's pride,</a>
<a id='line_4037'>  And take my turn, to court and be denied?</a>
<a id='line_4038'>  Shall I with this ungrateful Trojan go,</a>
<a id='line_4039'>  Forsake an empire, and attend a foe?</a>
<a id='line_4040'>  Himself I refug'd, and his train reliev'd-</a>
<a id='line_4041'>  'T is true- but am I sure to be receiv'd?</a>
<a id='line_4042'>  Can gratitude in Trojan souls have place!</a>
<a id='line_4043'>  Laomedon still lives in all his race!</a>
<a id='line_4044'>  Then, shall I seek alone the churlish crew,</a>
<a id='line_4045'>  Or with my fleet their flying sails pursue?</a>
<a id='line_4046'>  What force have I but those whom scarce before</a>
<a id='line_4047'>  I drew reluctant from their native shore?</a>
<a id='line_4048'>  Will they again embark at my desire,</a>
<a id='line_4049'>  Once more sustain the seas, and quit their second Tyre?</a>
<a id='line_4050'>  Rather with steel thy guilty breast invade,</a>
<a id='line_4051'>  And take the fortune thou thyself hast made.</a>
<a id='line_4052'>  Your pity, sister, first seduc'd my mind,</a>
<a id='line_4053'>  Or seconded too well what I design'd.</a>
<a id='line_4054'>  These dear-bought pleasures had I never known,</a>
<a id='line_4055'>  Had I continued free, and still my own;</a>
<a id='line_4056'>  Avoiding love, I had not found despair,</a>
<a id='line_4057'>  But shar'd with salvage beasts the common air.</a>
<a id='line_4058'>  Like them, a lonely life I might have led,</a>
<a id='line_4059'>  Not mourn'd the living, nor disturb'd the dead."</a>
<a id='line_4060'>  These thoughts she brooded in her anxious breast.</a>
<a id='line_4061'>  On board, the Trojan found more easy rest.</a>
<a id='line_4062'>  Resolv'd to sail, in sleep he pass'd the night;</a>
<a id='line_4063'>  And order'd all things for his early flight.</a>
<a id='line_4064'></a>
<a id='line_4065'>  To whom once more the winged god appears;</a>
<a id='line_4066'>  His former youthful mien and shape he wears,</a>
<a id='line_4067'>  And with this new alarm invades his ears:</a>
<a id='line_4068'>  "Sleep'st thou, O goddess-born! and canst thou drown</a>
<a id='line_4069'>  Thy needful cares, so near a hostile town,</a>
<a id='line_4070'>  Beset with foes; nor hear'st the western gales</a>
<a id='line_4071'>  Invite thy passage, and inspire thy sails?</a>
<a id='line_4072'>  She harbors in her heart a furious hate,</a>
<a id='line_4073'>  And thou shalt find the dire effects too late;</a>
<a id='line_4074'>  Fix'd on revenge, and obstinate to die.</a>
<a id='line_4075'>  Haste swiftly hence, while thou hast pow'r to fly.</a>
<a id='line_4076'>  The sea with ships will soon be cover'd o'er,</a>
<a id='line_4077'>  And blazing firebrands kindle all the shore.</a>
<a id='line_4078'>  Prevent her rage, while night obscures the skies,</a>
<a id='line_4079'>  And sail before the purple morn arise.</a>
<a id='line_4080'>  Who knows what hazards thy delay may bring?</a>
<a id='line_4081'>  Woman's a various and a changeful thing."</a>
<a id='line_4082'>  Thus Hermes in the dream; then took his flight</a>
<a id='line_4083'>  Aloft in air unseen, and mix'd with night.</a>
<a id='line_4084'></a>
<a id='line_4085'>  Twice warn'd by the celestial messenger,</a>
<a id='line_4086'>  The pious prince arose with hasty fear;</a>
<a id='line_4087'>  Then rous'd his drowsy train without delay:</a>
<a id='line_4088'>  "Haste to your banks; your crooked anchors weigh,</a>
<a id='line_4089'>  And spread your flying sails, and stand to sea.</a>
<a id='line_4090'>  A god commands: he stood before my sight,</a>
<a id='line_4091'>  And urg'd us once again to speedy flight.</a>
<a id='line_4092'>  O sacred pow'r, what pow'r soe'er thou art,</a>
<a id='line_4093'>  To thy blest orders I resign my heart.</a>
<a id='line_4094'>  Lead thou the way; protect thy Trojan bands,</a>
<a id='line_4095'>  And prosper the design thy will commands."</a>
<a id='line_4096'>  He said: and, drawing forth his flaming sword,</a>
<a id='line_4097'>  His thund'ring arm divides the many-twisted cord.</a>
<a id='line_4098'>  An emulating zeal inspires his train:</a>
<a id='line_4099'>  They run; they snatch; they rush into the main.</a>
<a id='line_4100'>  With headlong haste they leave the desert shores,</a>
<a id='line_4101'>  And brush the liquid seas with lab'ring oars.</a>
<a id='line_4102'></a>
<a id='line_4103'>  Aurora now had left her saffron bed,</a>
<a id='line_4104'>  And beams of early light the heav'ns o'erspread,</a>
<a id='line_4105'>  When, from a tow'r, the queen, with wakeful eyes,</a>
<a id='line_4106'>  Saw day point upward from the rosy skies.</a>
<a id='line_4107'>  She look'd to seaward; but the sea was void,</a>
<a id='line_4108'>  And scarce in ken the sailing ships descried.</a>
<a id='line_4109'>  Stung with despite, and furious with despair,</a>
<a id='line_4110'>  She struck her trembling breast, and tore her hair.</a>
<a id='line_4111'>  "And shall th' ungrateful traitor go," she said,</a>
<a id='line_4112'>  "My land forsaken, and my love betray'd?</a>
<a id='line_4113'>  Shall we not arm? not rush from ev'ry street,</a>
<a id='line_4114'>  To follow, sink, and burn his perjur'd fleet?</a>
<a id='line_4115'>  Haste, haul my galleys out! pursue the foe!</a>
<a id='line_4116'>  Bring flaming brands! set sail, and swiftly row!</a>
<a id='line_4117'>  What have I said? where am I? Fury turns</a>
<a id='line_4118'>  My brain; and my distemper'd bosom burns.</a>
<a id='line_4119'>  Then, when I gave my person and my throne,</a>
<a id='line_4120'>  This hate, this rage, had been more timely shown.</a>
<a id='line_4121'>  See now the promis'd faith, the vaunted name,</a>
<a id='line_4122'>  The pious man, who, rushing thro' the flame,</a>
<a id='line_4123'>  Preserv'd his gods, and to the Phrygian shore</a>
<a id='line_4124'>  The burthen of his feeble father bore!</a>
<a id='line_4125'>  I should have torn him piecemeal; strow'd in floods</a>
<a id='line_4126'>  His scatter'd limbs, or left expos'd in woods;</a>
<a id='line_4127'>  Destroy'd his friends and son; and, from the fire,</a>
<a id='line_4128'>  Have set the reeking boy before the sire.</a>
<a id='line_4129'>  Events are doubtful, which on battles wait:</a>
<a id='line_4130'>  Yet where's the doubt, to souls secure of fate?</a>
<a id='line_4131'>  My Tyrians, at their injur'd queen's command,</a>
<a id='line_4132'>  Had toss'd their fires amid the Trojan band;</a>
<a id='line_4133'>  At once extinguish'd all the faithless name;</a>
<a id='line_4134'>  And I myself, in vengeance of my shame,</a>
<a id='line_4135'>  Had fall'n upon the pile, to mend the fun'ral flame.</a>
<a id='line_4136'>  Thou Sun, who view'st at once the world below;</a>
<a id='line_4137'>  Thou Juno, guardian of the nuptial vow;</a>
<a id='line_4138'>  Thou Hecate hearken from thy dark abodes!</a>
<a id='line_4139'>  Ye Furies, fiends, and violated gods,</a>
<a id='line_4140'>  All pow'rs invok'd with Dido's dying breath,</a>
<a id='line_4141'>  Attend her curses and avenge her death!</a>
<a id='line_4142'>  If so the Fates ordain, Jove commands,</a>
<a id='line_4143'>  Th' ungrateful wretch should find the Latian lands,</a>
<a id='line_4144'>  Yet let a race untam'd, and haughty foes,</a>
<a id='line_4145'>  His peaceful entrance with dire arms oppose:</a>
<a id='line_4146'>  Oppress'd with numbers in th' unequal field,</a>
<a id='line_4147'>  His men discourag'd, and himself expell'd,</a>
<a id='line_4148'>  Let him for succor sue from place to place,</a>
<a id='line_4149'>  Torn from his subjects, and his son's embrace.</a>
<a id='line_4150'>  First, let him see his friends in battle slain,</a>
<a id='line_4151'>  And their untimely fate lament in vain;</a>
<a id='line_4152'>  And when, at length, the cruel war shall cease,</a>
<a id='line_4153'>  On hard conditions may he buy his peace:</a>
<a id='line_4154'>  Nor let him then enjoy supreme command;</a>
<a id='line_4155'>  But fall, untimely, by some hostile hand,</a>
<a id='line_4156'>  And lie unburied on the barren sand!</a>
<a id='line_4157'>  These are my pray'rs, and this my dying will;</a>
<a id='line_4158'>  And you, my Tyrians, ev'ry curse fulfil.</a>
<a id='line_4159'>  Perpetual hate and mortal wars proclaim,</a>
<a id='line_4160'>  Against the prince, the people, and the name.</a>
<a id='line_4161'>  These grateful off'rings on my grave bestow;</a>
<a id='line_4162'>  Nor league, nor love, the hostile nations know!</a>
<a id='line_4163'>  Now, and from hence, in ev'ry future age,</a>
<a id='line_4164'>  When rage excites your arms, and strength supplies the rage</a>
<a id='line_4165'>  Rise some avenger of our Libyan blood,</a>
<a id='line_4166'>  With fire and sword pursue the perjur'd brood;</a>
<a id='line_4167'>  Our arms, our seas, our shores, oppos'd to theirs;</a>
<a id='line_4168'>  And the same hate descend on all our heirs!"</a>
<a id='line_4169'></a>
<a id='line_4170'>  This said, within her anxious mind she weighs</a>
<a id='line_4171'>  The means of cutting short her odious days.</a>
<a id='line_4172'>  Then to Sichaeus' nurse she briefly said</a>
<a id='line_4173'>  (For, when she left her country, hers was dead):</a>
<a id='line_4174'>  "Go, Barce, call my sister. Let her care</a>
<a id='line_4175'>  The solemn rites of sacrifice prepare;</a>
<a id='line_4176'>  The sheep, and all th' atoning off'rings bring,</a>
<a id='line_4177'>  Sprinkling her body from the crystal spring</a>
<a id='line_4178'>  With living drops; then let her come, and thou</a>
<a id='line_4179'>  With sacred fillets bind thy hoary brow.</a>
<a id='line_4180'>  Thus will I pay my vows to Stygian Jove,</a>
<a id='line_4181'>  And end the cares of my disastrous love;</a>
<a id='line_4182'>  Then cast the Trojan image on the fire,</a>
<a id='line_4183'>  And, as that burns, my passions shall expire."</a>
<a id='line_4184'></a>
<a id='line_4185'>  The nurse moves onward, with officious care,</a>
<a id='line_4186'>  And all the speed her aged limbs can bear.</a>
<a id='line_4187'>  But furious Dido, with dark thoughts involv'd,</a>
<a id='line_4188'>  Shook at the mighty mischief she resolv'd.</a>
<a id='line_4189'>  With livid spots distinguish'd was her face;</a>
<a id='line_4190'>  Red were her rolling eyes, and discompos'd her pace;</a>
<a id='line_4191'>  Ghastly she gaz'd, with pain she drew her breath,</a>
<a id='line_4192'>  And nature shiver'd at approaching death.</a>
<a id='line_4193'></a>
<a id='line_4194'>  Then swiftly to the fatal place she pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_4195'>  And mounts the fun'ral pile with furious haste;</a>
<a id='line_4196'>  Unsheathes the sword the Trojan left behind</a>
<a id='line_4197'>  (Not for so dire an enterprise design'd).</a>
<a id='line_4198'>  But when she view'd the garments loosely spread,</a>
<a id='line_4199'>  Which once he wore, and saw the conscious bed,</a>
<a id='line_4200'>  She paus'd, and with a sigh the robes embrac'd;</a>
<a id='line_4201'>  Then on the couch her trembling body cast,</a>
<a id='line_4202'>  Repress'd the ready tears, and spoke her last:</a>
<a id='line_4203'>  "Dear pledges of my love, while Heav'n so pleas'd,</a>
<a id='line_4204'>  Receive a soul, of mortal anguish eas'd:</a>
<a id='line_4205'>  My fatal course is finish'd; and I go,</a>
<a id='line_4206'>  A glorious name, among the ghosts below.</a>
<a id='line_4207'>  A lofty city by my hands is rais'd,</a>
<a id='line_4208'>  Pygmalion punish'd, and my lord appeas'd.</a>
<a id='line_4209'>  What could my fortune have afforded more,</a>
<a id='line_4210'>  Had the false Trojan never touch'd my shore!"</a>
<a id='line_4211'>  Then kiss'd the couch; and, "Must I die," she said,</a>
<a id='line_4212'>  "And unreveng'd? 'T is doubly to be dead!</a>
<a id='line_4213'>  Yet ev'n this death with pleasure I receive:</a>
<a id='line_4214'>  On any terms, 't is better than to live.</a>
<a id='line_4215'>  These flames, from far, may the false Trojan view;</a>
<a id='line_4216'>  These boding omens his base flight pursue!"</a>
<a id='line_4217'></a>
<a id='line_4218'>  She said, and struck; deep enter'd in her side</a>
<a id='line_4219'>  The piercing steel, with reeking purple dyed:</a>
<a id='line_4220'>  Clogg'd in the wound the cruel weapon stands;</a>
<a id='line_4221'>  The spouting blood came streaming on her hands.</a>
<a id='line_4222'>  Her sad attendants saw the deadly stroke,</a>
<a id='line_4223'>  And with loud cries the sounding palace shook.</a>
<a id='line_4224'>  Distracted, from the fatal sight they fled,</a>
<a id='line_4225'>  And thro' the town the dismal rumor spread.</a>
<a id='line_4226'>  First from the frighted court the yell began;</a>
<a id='line_4227'>  Redoubled, thence from house to house it ran:</a>
<a id='line_4228'>  The groans of men, with shrieks, laments, and cries</a>
<a id='line_4229'>  Of mixing women, mount the vaulted skies.</a>
<a id='line_4230'>  Not less the clamor, than if- ancient Tyre,</a>
<a id='line_4231'>  Or the new Carthage, set by foes on fire-</a>
<a id='line_4232'>  The rolling ruin, with their lov'd abodes,</a>
<a id='line_4233'>  Involv'd the blazing temples of their gods.</a>
<a id='line_4234'></a>
<a id='line_4235'>  Her sister hears; and, furious with despair,</a>
<a id='line_4236'>  She beats her breast, and rends her yellow hair,</a>
<a id='line_4237'>  And, calling on Eliza's name aloud,</a>
<a id='line_4238'>  Runs breathless to the place, and breaks the crowd.</a>
<a id='line_4239'>  "Was all that pomp of woe for this prepar'd;</a>
<a id='line_4240'>  These fires, this fun'ral pile, these altars rear'd?</a>
<a id='line_4241'>  Was all this train of plots contriv'd," said she,</a>
<a id='line_4242'>  "All only to deceive unhappy me?</a>
<a id='line_4243'>  Which is the worst? Didst thou in death pretend</a>
<a id='line_4244'>  To scorn thy sister, or delude thy friend?</a>
<a id='line_4245'>  Thy summon'd sister, and thy friend, had come;</a>
<a id='line_4246'>  One sword had serv'd us both, one common tomb:</a>
<a id='line_4247'>  Was I to raise the pile, the pow'rs invoke,</a>
<a id='line_4248'>  Not to be present at the fatal stroke?</a>
<a id='line_4249'>  At once thou hast destroy'd thyself and me,</a>
<a id='line_4250'>  Thy town, thy senate, and thy colony!</a>
<a id='line_4251'>  Bring water; bathe the wound; while I in death</a>
<a id='line_4252'>  Lay close my lips to hers, and catch the flying breath."</a>
<a id='line_4253'>  This said, she mounts the pile with eager haste,</a>
<a id='line_4254'>  And in her arms the gasping queen embrac'd;</a>
<a id='line_4255'>  Her temples chaf'd; and her own garments tore,</a>
<a id='line_4256'>  To stanch the streaming blood, and cleanse the gore.</a>
<a id='line_4257'>  Thrice Dido tried to raise her drooping head,</a>
<a id='line_4258'>  And, fainting thrice, fell grov'ling on the bed;</a>
<a id='line_4259'>  Thrice op'd her heavy eyes, and sought the light,</a>
<a id='line_4260'>  But, having found it, sicken'd at the sight,</a>
<a id='line_4261'>  And clos'd her lids at last in endless night.</a>
<a id='line_4262'></a>
<a id='line_4263'>  Then Juno, grieving that she should sustain</a>
<a id='line_4264'>  A death so ling'ring, and so full of pain,</a>
<a id='line_4265'>  Sent Iris down, to free her from the strife</a>
<a id='line_4266'>  Of lab'ring nature, and dissolve her life.</a>
<a id='line_4267'>  For since she died, not doom'd by Heav'n's decree,</a>
<a id='line_4268'>  Or her own crime, but human casualty,</a>
<a id='line_4269'>  And rage of love, that plung'd her in despair,</a>
<a id='line_4270'>  The Sisters had not cut the topmost hair,</a>
<a id='line_4271'>  Which Proserpine and they can only know;</a>
<a id='line_4272'>  Nor made her sacred to the shades below.</a>
<a id='line_4273'>  Downward the various goddess took her flight,</a>
<a id='line_4274'>  And drew a thousand colors from the light;</a>
<a id='line_4275'>  Then stood above the dying lover's head,</a>
<a id='line_4276'>  And said: "I thus devote thee to the dead.</a>
<a id='line_4277'>  This off'ring to th' infernal gods I bear."</a>
<a id='line_4278'>  Thus while she spoke, she cut the fatal hair:</a>
<a id='line_4279'>  The struggling soul was loos'd, and life dissolv'd in air.</a>

<a id='line_4327'>  The course resolv'd, before the western wind</a>
<a id='line_4328'>  They scud amain, and make the port assign'd.</a>
<a id='line_4329'>  Meantime Acestes, from a lofty stand,</a>
<a id='line_4330'>  Beheld the fleet descending on the land;</a>
<a id='line_4331'>  And, not unmindful of his ancient race,</a>
<a id='line_4332'>  Down from the cliff he ran with eager pace,</a>
<a id='line_4333'>  And held the hero in a strict embrace.</a>
<a id='line_4334'>  Of a rough Libyan bear the spoils he wore,</a>
<a id='line_4335'>  And either hand a pointed jav'lin bore.</a>
<a id='line_4336'>  His mother was a dame of Dardan blood;</a>
<a id='line_4337'>  His sire Crinisus, a Sicilian flood.</a>
<a id='line_4338'>  He welcomes his returning friends ashore</a>
<a id='line_4339'>  With plenteous country cates and homely store.</a>
<a id='line_4340'></a>
<a id='line_4341'>  Now, when the following morn had chas'd away</a>
<a id='line_4342'>  The flying stars, and light restor'd the day,</a>
<a id='line_4343'>  Aeneas call'd the Trojan troops around,</a>
<a id='line_4344'>  And thus bespoke them from a rising ground:</a>
<a id='line_4345'>  "Offspring of heav'n, divine Dardanian race!</a>
<a id='line_4346'>  The sun, revolving thro' th' ethereal space,</a>
<a id='line_4347'>  The shining circle of the year has fill'd,</a>
<a id='line_4348'>  Since first this isle my father's ashes held:</a>
<a id='line_4349'>  And now the rising day renews the year;</a>
<a id='line_4350'>  A day for ever sad, for ever dear.</a>
<a id='line_4351'>  This would I celebrate with annual games,</a>
<a id='line_4352'>  With gifts on altars pil'd, and holy flames,</a>
<a id='line_4353'>  Tho' banish'd to Gaetulia's barren sands,</a>
<a id='line_4354'>  Caught on the Grecian seas, or hostile lands:</a>
<a id='line_4355'>  But since this happy storm our fleet has driv'n</a>
<a id='line_4356'>  (Not, as I deem, without the will of Heav'n)</a>
<a id='line_4357'>  Upon these friendly shores and flow'ry plains,</a>
<a id='line_4358'>  Which hide Anchises and his blest remains,</a>
<a id='line_4359'>  Let us with joy perform his honors due,</a>
<a id='line_4360'>  And pray for prosp'rous winds, our voyage to renew;</a>
<a id='line_4361'>  Pray, that in towns and temples of our own,</a>
<a id='line_4362'>  The name of great Anchises may be known,</a>
<a id='line_4363'>  And yearly games may spread the gods' renown.</a>
<a id='line_4364'>  Our sports Acestes, of the Trojan race,</a>
<a id='line_4365'>  With royal gifts ordain'd, is pleas'd to grace:</a>
<a id='line_4366'>  Two steers on ev'ry ship the king bestows;</a>
<a id='line_4367'>  His gods and ours shall share your equal vows.</a>
<a id='line_4368'>  Besides, if, nine days hence, the rosy morn</a>
<a id='line_4369'>  Shall with unclouded light the skies adorn,</a>
<a id='line_4370'>  That day with solemn sports I mean to grace:</a>
<a id='line_4371'>  Light galleys on the seas shall run a wat'ry race;</a>
<a id='line_4372'>  Some shall in swiftness for the goal contend,</a>
<a id='line_4373'>  And others try the twanging bow to bend;</a>
<a id='line_4374'>  The strong, with iron gauntlets arm'd, shall stand</a>
<a id='line_4375'>  Oppos'd in combat on the yellow sand.</a>
<a id='line_4376'>  Let all be present at the games prepar'd,</a>
<a id='line_4377'>  And joyful victors wait the just reward.</a>
<a id='line_4378'>  But now assist the rites, with garlands crown'd."</a>
<a id='line_4379'>  He said, and first his brows with myrtle bound.</a>
<a id='line_4380'>  Then Helymus, by his example led,</a>
<a id='line_4381'>  And old Acestes, each adorn'd his head;</a>
<a id='line_4382'>  Thus young Ascanius, with a sprightly grace,</a>
<a id='line_4383'>  His temples tied, and all the Trojan race.</a>
<a id='line_4384'>   Aeneas then advanc'd amidst the train,</a>
<a id='line_4385'>  By thousands follow'd thro' the flow'ry plain,</a>
<a id='line_4386'>  To great Anchises' tomb; which when he found,</a>
<a id='line_4387'>  He pour'd to Bacchus, on the hallow'd ground,</a>
<a id='line_4388'>  Two bowls of sparkling wine, of milk two more,</a>
<a id='line_4389'>  And two (from offer'd bulls) of purple gore,</a>
<a id='line_4390'>  With roses then the sepulcher he strow'd</a>
<a id='line_4391'>  And thus his father's ghost bespoke aloud:</a>
<a id='line_4392'>  "Hail, O ye holy manes! hail again,</a>
<a id='line_4393'>  Paternal ashes, now review'd in vain!</a>
<a id='line_4394'>  The gods permitted not, that you, with me,</a>
<a id='line_4395'>  Should reach the promis'd shores of Italy,</a>
<a id='line_4396'>  Or Tiber's flood, what flood soe'er it be."</a>
<a id='line_4397'>  Scarce had he finish'd, when, with speckled pride,</a>
<a id='line_4398'>  A serpent from the tomb began to glide;</a>
<a id='line_4399'>  His hugy bulk on sev'n high volumes roll'd;</a>
<a id='line_4400'>  Blue was his breadth of back, but streak'd with scaly gold:</a>
<a id='line_4401'>  Thus riding on his curls, he seem'd to pass</a>
<a id='line_4402'>  A rolling fire along, and singe the grass.</a>
<a id='line_4403'>  More various colors thro' his body run,</a>
<a id='line_4404'>  Than Iris when her bow imbibes the sun.</a>
<a id='line_4405'>  Betwixt the rising altars, and around,</a>
<a id='line_4406'>  The sacred monster shot along the ground;</a>
<a id='line_4407'>  With harmless play amidst the bowls he pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_4408'>  And with his lolling tongue assay'd the taste:</a>
<a id='line_4409'>  Thus fed with holy food, the wondrous guest</a>
<a id='line_4410'>  Within the hollow tomb retir'd to rest.</a>
<a id='line_4411'>  The pious prince, surpris'd at what he view'd,</a>
<a id='line_4412'>  The fun'ral honors with more zeal renew'd,</a>
<a id='line_4413'>  Doubtful if this place's genius were,</a>
<a id='line_4414'>  Or guardian of his father's sepulcher.</a>
<a id='line_4415'>  Five sheep, according to the rites, he slew;</a>
<a id='line_4416'>  As many swine, and steers of sable hue;</a>
<a id='line_4417'>  New gen'rous wine he from the goblets pour'd.</a>
<a id='line_4418'>  And call'd his father's ghost, from hell restor'd.</a>
<a id='line_4419'>  The glad attendants in long order come,</a>
<a id='line_4420'>  Off'ring their gifts at great Anchises' tomb:</a>
<a id='line_4421'>  Some add more oxen: some divide the spoil;</a>
<a id='line_4422'>  Some place the chargers on the grassy soil;</a>
<a id='line_4423'>  Some blow the fires, and offered entrails broil.</a>
<a id='line_4424'></a>
<a id='line_4425'>  Now came the day desir'd. The skies were bright</a>
<a id='line_4426'>  With rosy luster of the rising light:</a>
<a id='line_4427'>  The bord'ring people, rous'd by sounding fame</a>
<a id='line_4428'>  Of Trojan feasts and great Acestes' name,</a>
<a id='line_4429'>  The crowded shore with acclamations fill,</a>
<a id='line_4430'>  Part to behold, and part to prove their skill.</a>
<a id='line_4431'>  And first the gifts in public view they place,</a>
<a id='line_4432'>  Green laurel wreaths, and palm, the victors' grace:</a>
<a id='line_4433'>  Within the circle, arms and tripods lie,</a>
<a id='line_4434'>  Ingots of gold and silver, heap'd on high,</a>
<a id='line_4435'>  And vests embroider'd, of the Tyrian dye.</a>
<a id='line_4436'>  The trumpet's clangor then the feast proclaims,</a>
<a id='line_4437'>  And all prepare for their appointed games.</a>
<a id='line_4438'>  Four galleys first, which equal rowers bear,</a>
<a id='line_4439'>  Advancing, in the wat'ry lists appear.</a>
<a id='line_4440'>  The speedy Dolphin, that outstrips the wind,</a>
<a id='line_4441'>  Bore Mnestheus, author of the Memmian kind:</a>
<a id='line_4442'>  Gyas the vast Chimaera's bulk commands,</a>
<a id='line_4443'>  Which rising, like a tow'ring city stands;</a>
<a id='line_4444'>  Three Trojans tug at ev'ry lab'ring oar;</a>
<a id='line_4445'>  Three banks in three degrees the sailors bore;</a>
<a id='line_4446'>  Beneath their sturdy strokes the billows roar.</a>
<a id='line_4447'>  Sergesthus, who began the Sergian race,</a>
<a id='line_4448'>  In the great Centaur took the leading place;</a>
<a id='line_4449'>  Cloanthus on the sea-green Scylla stood,</a>
<a id='line_4450'>  From whom Cluentius draws his Trojan blood.</a>
<a id='line_4451'></a>
<a id='line_4452'>  Far in the sea, against the foaming shore,</a>
<a id='line_4453'>  There stands a rock: the raging billows roar</a>
<a id='line_4454'>  Above his head in storms; but, when 't is clear,</a>
<a id='line_4455'>  Uncurl their ridgy backs, and at his foot appear.</a>
<a id='line_4456'>  In peace below the gentle waters run;</a>
<a id='line_4457'>  The cormorants above lie basking in the sun.</a>
<a id='line_4458'>  On this the hero fix'd an oak in sight,</a>
<a id='line_4459'>  The mark to guide the mariners aright.</a>
<a id='line_4460'>  To bear with this, the seamen stretch their oars;</a>
<a id='line_4461'>  Then round the rock they steer, and seek the former shores.</a>
<a id='line_4462'>  The lots decide their place. Above the rest,</a>
<a id='line_4463'>  Each leader shining in his Tyrian vest;</a>
<a id='line_4464'>  The common crew with wreaths of poplar boughs</a>
<a id='line_4465'>  Their temples crown, and shade their sweaty brows:</a>
<a id='line_4466'>  Besmear'd with oil, their naked shoulders shine.</a>
<a id='line_4467'>  All take their seats, and wait the sounding sign:</a>
<a id='line_4468'>  They gripe their oars; and ev'ry panting breast</a>
<a id='line_4469'>  Is rais'd by turns with hope, by turns with fear depress'd.</a>
<a id='line_4470'>  The clangor of the trumpet gives the sign;</a>
<a id='line_4471'>  At once they start, advancing in a line:</a>
<a id='line_4472'>  With shouts the sailors rend the starry skies;</a>
<a id='line_4473'>  Lash'd with their oars, the smoky billows rise;</a>
<a id='line_4474'>  Sparkles the briny main, and the vex'd ocean fries.</a>
<a id='line_4475'>  Exact in time, with equal strokes they row:</a>
<a id='line_4476'>  At once the brushing oars and brazen prow</a>
<a id='line_4477'>  Dash up the sandy waves, and ope the depths below.</a>
<a id='line_4478'>  Not fiery coursers, in a chariot race,</a>
<a id='line_4479'>  Invade the field with half so swift a pace;</a>
<a id='line_4480'>  Not the fierce driver with more fury lends</a>
<a id='line_4481'>  The sounding lash, and, ere the stroke descends,</a>
<a id='line_4482'>  Low to the wheels his pliant body bends.</a>
<a id='line_4483'>  The partial crowd their hopes and fears divide,</a>
<a id='line_4484'>  And aid with eager shouts the favor'd side.</a>
<a id='line_4485'>  Cries, murmurs, clamors, with a mixing sound,</a>
<a id='line_4486'>  From woods to woods, from hills to hills rebound.</a>
<a id='line_4487'></a>
<a id='line_4488'>  Amidst the loud applauses of the shore,</a>
<a id='line_4489'>  Gyas outstripp'd the rest, and sprung before:</a>
<a id='line_4490'>  Cloanthus, better mann'd, pursued him fast,</a>
<a id='line_4491'>  But his o'er-masted galley check'd his haste.</a>
<a id='line_4492'>  The Centaur and the Dolphin brush the brine</a>
<a id='line_4493'>  With equal oars, advancing in a line;</a>
<a id='line_4494'>  And now the mighty Centaur seems to lead,</a>
<a id='line_4495'>  And now the speedy Dolphin gets ahead;</a>
<a id='line_4496'>  Now board to board the rival vessels row,</a>
<a id='line_4497'>  The billows lave the skies, and ocean groans below.</a>
<a id='line_4498'>  They reach'd the mark. Proud Gyas and his train</a>
<a id='line_4499'>  In triumph rode, the victors of the main;</a>
<a id='line_4500'>  But, steering round, he charg'd his pilot stand</a>
<a id='line_4501'>  More close to shore, and skim along the sand-</a>
<a id='line_4502'>  "Let others bear to sea!" Menoetes heard;</a>
<a id='line_4503'>  But secret shelves too cautiously he fear'd,</a>
<a id='line_4504'>  And, fearing, sought the deep; and still aloof he steer'd.</a>
<a id='line_4505'>  With louder cries the captain call'd again:</a>
<a id='line_4506'>  "Bear to the rocky shore, and shun the main."</a>
<a id='line_4507'>  He spoke, and, speaking, at his stern he saw</a>
<a id='line_4508'>  The bold Cloanthus near the shelvings draw.</a>
<a id='line_4509'>  Betwixt the mark and him the Scylla stood,</a>
<a id='line_4510'>  And in a closer compass plow'd the flood.</a>
<a id='line_4511'>  He pass'd the mark; and, wheeling, got before:</a>
<a id='line_4512'>  Gyas blasphem'd the gods, devoutly swore,</a>
<a id='line_4513'>  Cried out for anger, and his hair he tore.</a>
<a id='line_4514'>  Mindless of others' lives (so high was grown</a>
<a id='line_4515'>  His rising rage) and careless of his own,</a>
<a id='line_4516'>  The trembling dotard to the deck he drew;</a>
<a id='line_4517'>  Then hoisted up, and overboard he threw:</a>
<a id='line_4518'>  This done, he seiz'd the helm; his fellows cheer'd,</a>
<a id='line_4519'>  Turn'd short upon the shelfs, and madly steer'd.</a>
<a id='line_4520'></a>
<a id='line_4521'>  Hardly his head the plunging pilot rears,</a>
<a id='line_4522'>  Clogg'd with his clothes, and cumber'd with his years:</a>
<a id='line_4523'>  Now dropping wet, he climbs the cliff with pain.</a>
<a id='line_4524'>  The crowd, that saw him fall and float again,</a>
<a id='line_4525'>  Shout from the distant shore; and loudly laugh'd,</a>
<a id='line_4526'>  To see his heaving breast disgorge the briny draught.</a>
<a id='line_4527'>  The following Centaur, and the Dolphin's crew,</a>
<a id='line_4528'>  Their vanish'd hopes of victory renew;</a>
<a id='line_4529'>  While Gyas lags, they kindle in the race,</a>
<a id='line_4530'>  To reach the mark. Sergesthus takes the place;</a>
<a id='line_4531'>  Mnestheus pursues; and while around they wind,</a>
<a id='line_4532'>  Comes up, not half his galley's length behind;</a>
<a id='line_4533'>  Then, on the deck, amidst his mates appear'd,</a>
<a id='line_4534'>  And thus their drooping courage he cheer'd:</a>
<a id='line_4535'>  "My friends, and Hector's followers heretofore,</a>
<a id='line_4536'>  Exert your vigor; tug the lab'ring oar;</a>
<a id='line_4537'>  Stretch to your strokes, my still unconquer'd crew,</a>
<a id='line_4538'>  Whom from the flaming walls of Troy I drew.</a>
<a id='line_4539'>  In this, our common int'rest, let me find</a>
<a id='line_4540'>  That strength of hand, that courage of the mind,</a>
<a id='line_4541'>  As when you stemm'd the strong Malean flood,</a>
<a id='line_4542'>  And o'er the Syrtes' broken billows row'd.</a>
<a id='line_4543'>  I seek not now the foremost palm to gain;</a>
<a id='line_4544'>  Tho' yet- but, ah! that haughty wish is vain!</a>
<a id='line_4545'>  Let those enjoy it whom the gods ordain.</a>
<a id='line_4546'>  But to be last, the lags of all the race!-</a>
<a id='line_4547'>  Redeem yourselves and me from that disgrace."</a>
<a id='line_4548'>  Now, one and all, they tug amain; they row</a>
<a id='line_4549'>  At the full stretch, and shake the brazen prow.</a>
<a id='line_4550'>  The sea beneath 'em sinks; their lab'ring sides</a>
<a id='line_4551'>  Are swell'd, and sweat runs gutt'ring down in tides.</a>
<a id='line_4552'>  Chance aids their daring with unhop'd success;</a>
<a id='line_4553'>  Sergesthus, eager with his beak to press</a>
<a id='line_4554'>  Betwixt the rival galley and the rock,</a>
<a id='line_4555'>  Shuts up th' unwieldly Centaur in the lock.</a>
<a id='line_4556'>  The vessel struck; and, with the dreadful shock,</a>
<a id='line_4557'>  Her oars she shiver'd, and her head she broke.</a>
<a id='line_4558'>  The trembling rowers from their banks arise,</a>
<a id='line_4559'>  And, anxious for themselves, renounce the prize.</a>
<a id='line_4560'>  With iron poles they heave her off the shores,</a>
<a id='line_4561'>  And gather from the sea their floating oars.</a>
<a id='line_4562'>  The crew of Mnestheus, with elated minds,</a>
<a id='line_4563'>  Urge their success, and call the willing winds;</a>
<a id='line_4564'>  Then ply their oars, and cut their liquid way</a>
<a id='line_4565'>  In larger compass on the roomy sea.</a>
<a id='line_4566'>  As, when the dove her rocky hold forsakes,</a>
<a id='line_4567'>  Rous'd in a fright, her sounding wings she shakes;</a>
<a id='line_4568'>  The cavern rings with clatt'ring; out she flies,</a>
<a id='line_4569'>  And leaves her callow care, and cleaves the skies:</a>
<a id='line_4570'>  At first she flutters; but at length she springs</a>
<a id='line_4571'>  To smoother flight, and shoots upon her wings:</a>
<a id='line_4572'>  So Mnestheus in the Dolphin cuts the sea;</a>
<a id='line_4573'>  And, flying with a force, that force assists his way.</a>
<a id='line_4574'>  Sergesthus in the Centaur soon he pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_4575'>  Wedg'd in the rocky shoals, and sticking fast.</a>
<a id='line_4576'>  In vain the victor he with cries implores,</a>
<a id='line_4577'>  And practices to row with shatter'd oars.</a>
<a id='line_4578'>  Then Mnestheus bears with Gyas, and outflies:</a>
<a id='line_4579'>  The ship, without a pilot, yields the prize.</a>
<a id='line_4580'>  Unvanquish'd Scylla now alone remains;</a>
<a id='line_4581'>  Her he pursues, and all his vigor strains.</a>
<a id='line_4582'>  Shouts from the fav'ring multitude arise;</a>
<a id='line_4583'>  Applauding Echo to the shouts replies;</a>
<a id='line_4584'>  Shouts, wishes, and applause run rattling thro' the skies.</a>
<a id='line_4585'>  These clamors with disdain the Scylla heard,</a>
<a id='line_4586'>  Much grudg'd the praise, but more the robb'd reward:</a>
<a id='line_4587'>  Resolv'd to hold their own, they mend their pace,</a>
<a id='line_4588'>  All obstinate to die, or gain the race.</a>
<a id='line_4589'>  Rais'd with success, the Dolphin swiftly ran;</a>
<a id='line_4590'>  For they can conquer, who believe they can.</a>
<a id='line_4591'>  Both urge their oars, and fortune both supplies,</a>
<a id='line_4592'>  And both perhaps had shar'd an equal prize;</a>
<a id='line_4593'>  When to the seas Cloanthus holds his hands,</a>
<a id='line_4594'>  And succor from the wat'ry pow'rs demands:</a>
<a id='line_4595'>  "Gods of the liquid realms, on which I row!</a>
<a id='line_4596'>  If, giv'n by you, the laurel bind my brow,</a>
<a id='line_4597'>  Assist to make me guilty of my vow!</a>
<a id='line_4598'>  A snow-white bull shall on your shore be slain;</a>
<a id='line_4599'>  His offer'd entrails cast into the main,</a>
<a id='line_4600'>  And ruddy wine, from golden goblets thrown,</a>
<a id='line_4601'>  Your grateful gift and my return shall own."</a>
<a id='line_4602'>  The choir of nymphs, and Phorcus, from below,</a>
<a id='line_4603'>  With virgin Panopea, heard his vow;</a>
<a id='line_4604'>  And old Portunus, with his breadth of hand,</a>
<a id='line_4605'>  Push'd on, and sped the galley to the land.</a>
<a id='line_4606'>  Swift as a shaft, or winged wind, she flies,</a>
<a id='line_4607'>  And, darting to the port, obtains the prize.</a>
<a id='line_4608'></a>
<a id='line_4609'>  The herald summons all, and then proclaims</a>
<a id='line_4610'>  Cloanthus conqu'ror of the naval games.</a>
<a id='line_4611'>  The prince with laurel crowns the victor's head,</a>
<a id='line_4612'>  And three fat steers are to his vessel led,</a>
<a id='line_4613'>  The ship's reward; with gen'rous wine beside,</a>
<a id='line_4614'>  And sums of silver, which the crew divide.</a>
<a id='line_4615'>  The leaders are distinguish'd from the rest;</a>
<a id='line_4616'>  The victor honor'd with a nobler vest,</a>
<a id='line_4617'>  Where gold and purple strive in equal rows,</a>
<a id='line_4618'>  And needlework its happy cost bestows.</a>
<a id='line_4619'>  There Ganymede is wrought with living art,</a>
<a id='line_4620'>  Chasing thro' Ida's groves the trembling hart:</a>
<a id='line_4621'>  Breathless he seems, yet eager to pursue;</a>
<a id='line_4622'>  When from aloft descends, in open view,</a>
<a id='line_4623'>  The bird of Jove, and, sousing on his prey,</a>
<a id='line_4624'>  With crooked talons bears the boy away.</a>
<a id='line_4625'>  In vain, with lifted hands and gazing eyes,</a>
<a id='line_4626'>  His guards behold him soaring thro' the skies,</a>
<a id='line_4627'>  And dogs pursue his flight with imitated cries.</a>
<a id='line_4628'></a>
<a id='line_4629'>  Mnestheus the second victor was declar'd;</a>
<a id='line_4630'>  And, summon'd there, the second prize he shard.</a>
<a id='line_4631'>  A coat of mail, brave Demoleus bore,</a>
<a id='line_4632'>  More brave Aeneas from his shoulders tore,</a>
<a id='line_4633'>  In single combat on the Trojan shore:</a>
<a id='line_4634'>  This was ordain'd for Mnestheus to possess;</a>
<a id='line_4635'>  In war for his defense, for ornament in peace.</a>
<a id='line_4636'>  Rich was the gift, and glorious to behold,</a>
<a id='line_4637'>  But yet so pond'rous with its plates of gold,</a>
<a id='line_4638'>  That scarce two servants could the weight sustain;</a>
<a id='line_4639'>  Yet, loaded thus, Demoleus o'er the plain</a>
<a id='line_4640'>  Pursued and lightly seiz'd the Trojan train.</a>
<a id='line_4641'>  The third, succeeding to the last reward,</a>
<a id='line_4642'>  Two goodly bowls of massy silver shar'd,</a>
<a id='line_4643'>  With figures prominent, and richly wrought,</a>
<a id='line_4644'>  And two brass caldrons from Dodona brought.</a>
<a id='line_4645'></a>
<a id='line_4646'>  Thus all, rewarded by the hero's hands,</a>
<a id='line_4647'>  Their conqu'ring temples bound with purple bands;</a>
<a id='line_4648'>  And now Sergesthus, clearing from the rock,</a>
<a id='line_4649'>  Brought back his galley shatter'd with the shock.</a>
<a id='line_4650'>  Forlorn she look'd, without an aiding oar,</a>
<a id='line_4651'>  And, houted by the vulgar, made to shore.</a>
<a id='line_4652'>  As when a snake, surpris'd upon the road,</a>
<a id='line_4653'>  Is crush'd athwart her body by the load</a>
<a id='line_4654'>  Of heavy wheels; or with a mortal wound</a>
<a id='line_4655'>  Her belly bruis'd, and trodden to the ground:</a>
<a id='line_4656'>  In vain, with loosen'd curls, she crawls along;</a>
<a id='line_4657'>  Yet, fierce above, she brandishes her tongue;</a>
<a id='line_4658'>  Glares with her eyes, and bristles with her scales;</a>
<a id='line_4659'>  But, groveling in the dust, her parts unsound she trails:</a>
<a id='line_4660'>  So slowly to the port the Centaur tends,</a>
<a id='line_4661'>  But, what she wants in oars, with sails amends.</a>
<a id='line_4662'>  Yet, for his galley sav'd, the grateful prince</a>
<a id='line_4663'>  Is pleas'd th' unhappy chief to recompense.</a>
<a id='line_4664'>  Pholoe, the Cretan slave, rewards his care,</a>
<a id='line_4665'>  Beauteous herself, with lovely twins as fair.</a>
<a id='line_4666'></a>
<a id='line_4667'>  From thence his way the Trojan hero bent</a>
<a id='line_4668'>  Into the neighb'ring plain, with mountains pent,</a>
<a id='line_4669'>  Whose sides were shaded with surrounding wood.</a>
<a id='line_4670'>  Full in the midst of this fair valley stood</a>
<a id='line_4671'>  A native theater, which, rising slow</a>
<a id='line_4672'>  By just degrees, o'erlook'd the ground below.</a>
<a id='line_4673'>  High on a sylvan throne the leader sate;</a>
<a id='line_4674'>  A num'rous train attend in solemn state.</a>
<a id='line_4675'>  Here those that in the rapid course delight,</a>
<a id='line_4676'>  Desire of honor and the prize invite.</a>
<a id='line_4677'>  The rival runners without order stand;</a>
<a id='line_4678'>  The Trojans mix'd with the Sicilian band.</a>
<a id='line_4679'>  First Nisus, with Euryalus, appears;</a>
<a id='line_4680'>  Euryalus a boy of blooming years,</a>
<a id='line_4681'>  With sprightly grace and equal beauty crown'd;</a>
<a id='line_4682'>  Nisus, for friendship to the youth renown'd.</a>
<a id='line_4683'>  Diores next, of Priam's royal race,</a>
<a id='line_4684'>  Then Salius joined with Patron, took their place;</a>
<a id='line_4685'>  (But Patron in Arcadia had his birth,</a>
<a id='line_4686'>  And Salius his from Arcananian earth;)</a>
<a id='line_4687'>  Then two Sicilian youths- the names of these,</a>
<a id='line_4688'>  Swift Helymus, and lovely Panopes:</a>
<a id='line_4689'>  Both jolly huntsmen, both in forest bred,</a>
<a id='line_4690'>  And owning old Acestes for their head;</a>
<a id='line_4691'>  With sev'ral others of ignobler name,</a>
<a id='line_4692'>  Whom time has not deliver'd o'er to fame.</a>
<a id='line_4693'></a>
<a id='line_4694'>  To these the hero thus his thoughts explain'd,</a>
<a id='line_4695'>  In words which gen'ral approbation gain'd:</a>
<a id='line_4696'>  "One common largess is for all design'd,</a>
<a id='line_4697'>  (The vanquish'd and the victor shall be join'd,)</a>
<a id='line_4698'>  Two darts of polish'd steel and Gnosian wood,</a>
<a id='line_4699'>  A silver-studded ax, alike bestow'd.</a>
<a id='line_4700'>  The foremost three have olive wreaths decreed:</a>
<a id='line_4701'>  The first of these obtains a stately steed,</a>
<a id='line_4702'>  Adorn'd with trappings; and the next in fame,</a>
<a id='line_4703'>  The quiver of an Amazonian dame,</a>
<a id='line_4704'>  With feather'd Thracian arrows well supplied:</a>
<a id='line_4705'>  A golden belt shall gird his manly side,</a>
<a id='line_4706'>  Which with a sparkling diamond shall be tied.</a>
<a id='line_4707'>  The third this Grecian helmet shall content."</a>
<a id='line_4708'>  He said. To their appointed base they went;</a>
<a id='line_4709'>  With beating hearts th' expected sign receive,</a>
<a id='line_4710'>  And, starting all at once, the barrier leave.</a>
<a id='line_4711'>  Spread out, as on the winged winds, they flew,</a>
<a id='line_4712'>  And seiz'd the distant goal with greedy view.</a>
<a id='line_4713'>  Shot from the crowd, swift Nisus all o'erpass'd;</a>
<a id='line_4714'>  Nor storms, nor thunder, equal half his haste.</a>
<a id='line_4715'>  The next, but tho' the next, yet far disjoin'd,</a>
<a id='line_4716'>  Came Salius, and Euryalus behind;</a>
<a id='line_4717'>  Then Helymus, whom young Diores plied,</a>
<a id='line_4718'>  Step after step, and almost side by side,</a>
<a id='line_4719'>  His shoulders pressing; and, in longer space,</a>
<a id='line_4720'>  Had won, or left at least a dubious race.</a>
<a id='line_4721'></a>
<a id='line_4722'>  Now, spent, the goal they almost reach at last,</a>
<a id='line_4723'>  When eager Nisus, hapless in his haste,</a>
<a id='line_4724'>  Slipp'd first, and, slipping, fell upon the plain,</a>
<a id='line_4725'>  Soak'd with the blood of oxen newly slain.</a>
<a id='line_4726'>  The careless victor had not mark'd his way;</a>
<a id='line_4727'>  But, treading where the treach'rous puddle lay,</a>
<a id='line_4728'>  His heels flew up; and on the grassy floor</a>
<a id='line_4729'>  He fell, besmear'd with filth and holy gore.</a>
<a id='line_4730'>  Not mindless then, Euryalus, of thee,</a>
<a id='line_4731'>  Nor of the sacred bonds of amity,</a>
<a id='line_4732'>  He strove th' immediate rival's hope to cross,</a>
<a id='line_4733'>  And caught the foot of Salius as he rose.</a>
<a id='line_4734'>  So Salius lay extended on the plain;</a>
<a id='line_4735'>  Euryalus springs out, the prize to gain,</a>
<a id='line_4736'>  And leaves the crowd: applauding peals attend</a>
<a id='line_4737'>  The victor to the goal, who vanquish'd by his friend.</a>
<a id='line_4738'>  Next Helymus; and then Diores came,</a>
<a id='line_4739'>  By two misfortunes made the third in fame.</a>
<a id='line_4740'></a>
<a id='line_4741'>  But Salius enters, and, exclaiming loud</a>
<a id='line_4742'>  For justice, deafens and disturbs the crowd;</a>
<a id='line_4743'>  Urges his cause may in the court be heard;</a>
<a id='line_4744'>  And pleads the prize is wrongfully conferr'd.</a>
<a id='line_4745'>  But favor for Euryalus appears;</a>
<a id='line_4746'>  His blooming beauty, with his tender tears,</a>
<a id='line_4747'>  Had brib'd the judges for the promis'd prize.</a>
<a id='line_4748'>  Besides, Diores fills the court with cries,</a>
<a id='line_4749'>  Who vainly reaches at the last reward,</a>
<a id='line_4750'>  If the first palm on Salius be conferr'd.</a>
<a id='line_4751'>  Then thus the prince: "Let no disputes arise:</a>
<a id='line_4752'>  Where fortune plac'd it, I award the prize.</a>
<a id='line_4753'>  But fortune's errors give me leave to mend,</a>
<a id='line_4754'>  At least to pity my deserving friend."</a>
<a id='line_4755'>  He said, and, from among the spoils, he draws</a>
<a id='line_4756'>  (Pond'rous with shaggy mane and golden paws)</a>
<a id='line_4757'>  A lion's hide: to Salius this he gives.</a>
<a id='line_4758'>  Nisus with envy sees the gift, and grieves.</a>
<a id='line_4759'>  "If such rewards to vanquish'd men are due."</a>
<a id='line_4760'>  He said, "and falling is to rise by you,</a>
<a id='line_4761'>  What prize may Nisus from your bounty claim,</a>
<a id='line_4762'>  Who merited the first rewards and fame?</a>
<a id='line_4763'>  In falling, both an equal fortune tried;</a>
<a id='line_4764'>  Would fortune for my fall so well provide!"</a>
<a id='line_4765'>  With this he pointed to his face, and show'd</a>
<a id='line_4766'>  His hand and all his habit smear'd with blood.</a>
<a id='line_4767'>  Th' indulgent father of the people smil'd,</a>
<a id='line_4768'>  And caus'd to be produc'd an ample shield,</a>
<a id='line_4769'>  Of wondrous art, by Didymaon wrought,</a>
<a id='line_4770'>  Long since from Neptune's bars in triumph brought.</a>
<a id='line_4771'>  This giv'n to Nisus, he divides the rest,</a>
<a id='line_4772'>  And equal justice in his gifts express'd.</a>
<a id='line_4773'></a>
<a id='line_4774'>  The race thus ended, and rewards bestow'd,</a>
<a id='line_4775'>  Once more the prince bespeaks th' attentive crowd:</a>
<a id='line_4776'>  "If there he here whose dauntless courage dare</a>
<a id='line_4777'>  In gauntlet-fight, with limbs and body bare,</a>
<a id='line_4778'>  His opposite sustain in open view,</a>
<a id='line_4779'>  Stand forth the champion, and the games renew.</a>
<a id='line_4780'>  Two prizes I propose, and thus divide:</a>
<a id='line_4781'>  A bull with gilded horns, and fillets tied,</a>
<a id='line_4782'>  Shall be the portion of the conqu'ring chief;</a>
<a id='line_4783'>  A sword and helm shall cheer the loser's grief."</a>
<a id='line_4784'></a>
<a id='line_4785'>  Then haughty Dares in the lists appears;</a>
<a id='line_4786'>  Stalking he strides, his head erected bears:</a>
<a id='line_4787'>  His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield,</a>
<a id='line_4788'>  And loud applauses echo thro' the field.</a>
<a id='line_4789'>  Dares alone in combat us'd to stand</a>
<a id='line_4790'>  The match of mighty Paris, hand to hand;</a>
<a id='line_4791'>  The same, at Hector's fun'rals, undertook</a>
<a id='line_4792'>  Gigantic Butes, of th' Amycian stock,</a>
<a id='line_4793'>  And, by the stroke of his resistless hand,</a>
<a id='line_4794'>  Stretch'd the vast bulk upon the yellow sand.</a>
<a id='line_4795'>  Such Dares was; and such he strode along,</a>
<a id='line_4796'>  And drew the wonder of the gazing throng.</a>
<a id='line_4797'>  His brawny back and ample breast he shows,</a>
<a id='line_4798'>  His lifted arms around his head he throws,</a>
<a id='line_4799'>  And deals in whistling air his empty blows.</a>
<a id='line_4800'>  His match is sought; but, thro' the trembling band,</a>
<a id='line_4801'>  Not one dares answer to the proud demand.</a>
<a id='line_4802'>  Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes</a>
<a id='line_4803'>  Already he devours the promis'd prize.</a>
<a id='line_4804'>  He claims the bull with awless insolence,</a>
<a id='line_4805'>  And having seiz'd his horns, accosts the prince:</a>
<a id='line_4806'>  "If none my matchless valor dares oppose,</a>
<a id='line_4807'>  How long shall Dares wait his dastard foes?</a>
<a id='line_4808'>  Permit me, chief, permit without delay,</a>
<a id='line_4809'>  To lead this uncontended gift away."</a>
<a id='line_4810'>  The crowd assents, and with redoubled cries</a>
<a id='line_4811'>  For the proud challenger demands the prize.</a>
<a id='line_4812'></a>
<a id='line_4813'>  Acestes, fir'd with just disdain, to see</a>
<a id='line_4814'>  The palm usurp'd without a victory,</a>
<a id='line_4815'>  Reproach'd Entellus thus, who sate beside,</a>
<a id='line_4816'>  And heard and saw, unmov'd, the Trojan's pride:</a>
<a id='line_4817'>  "Once, but in vain, a champion of renown,</a>
<a id='line_4818'>  So tamely can you bear the ravish'd crown,</a>
<a id='line_4819'>  A prize in triumph borne before your sight,</a>
<a id='line_4820'>  And shun, for fear, the danger of the fight?</a>
<a id='line_4821'>  Where is our Eryx now, the boasted name,</a>
<a id='line_4822'>  The god who taught your thund'ring arm the game?</a>
<a id='line_4823'>  Where now your baffled honor? Where the spoil</a>
<a id='line_4824'>  That fill'd your house, and fame that fill'd our isle?"</a>
<a id='line_4825'>  Entellus, thus: "My soul is still the same,</a>
<a id='line_4826'>  Unmov'd with fear, and mov'd with martial fame;</a>
<a id='line_4827'>  But my chill blood is curdled in my veins,</a>
<a id='line_4828'>  And scarce the shadow of a man remains.</a>
<a id='line_4829'>  O could I turn to that fair prime again,</a>
<a id='line_4830'>  That prime of which this boaster is so vain,</a>
<a id='line_4831'>  The brave, who this decrepid age defies,</a>
<a id='line_4832'>  Should feel my force, without the promis'd prize."</a>
<a id='line_4833'></a>
<a id='line_4834'>  He said; and, rising at the word, he threw</a>
<a id='line_4835'>  Two pond'rous gauntlets down in open view;</a>
<a id='line_4836'>  Gauntlets which Eryx wont in fight to wield,</a>
<a id='line_4837'>  And sheathe his hands with in the listed field.</a>
<a id='line_4838'>  With fear and wonder seiz'd, the crowd beholds</a>
<a id='line_4839'>  The gloves of death, with sev'n distinguish'd folds</a>
<a id='line_4840'>  Of tough bull hides; the space within is spread</a>
<a id='line_4841'>  With iron, or with loads of heavy lead:</a>
<a id='line_4842'>  Dares himself was daunted at the sight,</a>
<a id='line_4843'>  Renounc'd his challenge, and refus'd to fight.</a>
<a id='line_4844'>  Astonish'd at their weight, the hero stands,</a>
<a id='line_4845'>  And pois'd the pond'rous engines in his hands.</a>
<a id='line_4846'>  "What had your wonder," said Entellus, "been,</a>
<a id='line_4847'>  Had you the gauntlets of Alcides seen,</a>
<a id='line_4848'>  Or view'd the stern debate on this unhappy green!</a>
<a id='line_4849'>  These which I bear your brother Eryx bore,</a>
<a id='line_4850'>  Still mark'd with batter'd brains and mingled gore.</a>
<a id='line_4851'>  With these he long sustain'd th' Herculean arm;</a>
<a id='line_4852'>  And these I wielded while my blood was warm,</a>
<a id='line_4853'>  This languish'd frame while better spirits fed,</a>
<a id='line_4854'>  Ere age unstrung my nerves, or time o'ersnow'd my head.</a>
<a id='line_4855'>  But if the challenger these arms refuse,</a>
<a id='line_4856'>  And cannot wield their weight, or dare not use;</a>
<a id='line_4857'>  If great Aeneas and Acestes join</a>
<a id='line_4858'>  In his request, these gauntlets I resign;</a>
<a id='line_4859'>  Let us with equal arms perform the fight,</a>
<a id='line_4860'>  And let him leave to fear, since I resign my right."</a>
<a id='line_4861'></a>
<a id='line_4862'>  This said, Entellus for the strife prepares;</a>
<a id='line_4863'>  Stripp'd of his quilted coat, his body bares;</a>
<a id='line_4864'>  Compos'd of mighty bones and brawn he stands,</a>
<a id='line_4865'>  A goodly tow'ring object on the sands.</a>
<a id='line_4866'>  Then just Aeneas equal arms supplied,</a>
<a id='line_4867'>  Which round their shoulders to their wrists they tied.</a>
<a id='line_4868'>  Both on the tiptoe stand, at full extent,</a>
<a id='line_4869'>  Their arms aloft, their bodies inly bent;</a>
<a id='line_4870'>  Their heads from aiming blows they bear afar;</a>
<a id='line_4871'>  With clashing gauntlets then provoke the war.</a>
<a id='line_4872'>  One on his youth and pliant limbs relies;</a>
<a id='line_4873'>  One on his sinews and his giant size.</a>
<a id='line_4874'>  The last is stiff with age, his motion slow;</a>
<a id='line_4875'>  He heaves for breath, he staggers to and fro,</a>
<a id='line_4876'>  And clouds of issuing smoke his nostrils loudly blow.</a>
<a id='line_4877'>  Yet equal in success, they ward, they strike;</a>
<a id='line_4878'>  Their ways are diff'rent, but their art alike.</a>
<a id='line_4879'>  Before, behind, the blows are dealt; around</a>
<a id='line_4880'>  Their hollow sides the rattling thumps resound.</a>
<a id='line_4881'>  A storm of strokes, well meant, with fury flies,</a>
<a id='line_4882'>  And errs about their temples, ears, and eyes.</a>
<a id='line_4883'>  Nor always errs; for oft the gauntlet draws</a>
<a id='line_4884'>  A sweeping stroke along the crackling jaws.</a>
<a id='line_4885'>  Heavy with age, Entellus stands his ground,</a>
<a id='line_4886'>  But with his warping body wards the wound.</a>
<a id='line_4887'>  His hand and watchful eye keep even pace;</a>
<a id='line_4888'>  While Dares traverses and shifts his place,</a>
<a id='line_4889'>  And, like a captain who beleaguers round</a>
<a id='line_4890'>  Some strong-built castle on a rising ground,</a>
<a id='line_4891'>  Views all th' approaches with observing eyes:</a>
<a id='line_4892'>  This and that other part in vain he tries,</a>
<a id='line_4893'>  And more on industry than force relies.</a>
<a id='line_4894'>  With hands on high, Entellus threats the foe;</a>
<a id='line_4895'>  But Dares watch'd the motion from below,</a>
<a id='line_4896'>  And slipp'd aside, and shunn'd the long descending blow.</a>
<a id='line_4897'>  Entellus wastes his forces on the wind,</a>
<a id='line_4898'>  And, thus deluded of the stroke design'd,</a>
<a id='line_4899'>  Headlong and heavy fell; his ample breast</a>
<a id='line_4900'>  And weighty limbs his ancient mother press'd.</a>
<a id='line_4901'>  So falls a hollow pine, that long had stood</a>
<a id='line_4902'>  On Ida's height, or Erymanthus' wood,</a>
<a id='line_4903'>  Torn from the roots. The diff'ring nations rise,</a>
<a id='line_4904'>  And shouts and mingled murmurs rend the skies,</a>
<a id='line_4905'>  Acestus runs with eager haste, to raise</a>
<a id='line_4906'>  The fall'n companion of his youthful days.</a>
<a id='line_4907'>  Dauntless he rose, and to the fight return'd;</a>
<a id='line_4908'>  With shame his glowing cheeks, his eyes with fury burn'd.</a>
<a id='line_4909'>  Disdain and conscious virtue fir'd his breast,</a>
<a id='line_4910'>  And with redoubled force his foe he press'd.</a>
<a id='line_4911'>  He lays on load with either hand, amain,</a>
<a id='line_4912'>  And headlong drives the Trojan o'er the plain;</a>
<a id='line_4913'>  Nor stops, nor stays; nor rest nor breath allows;</a>
<a id='line_4914'>  But storms of strokes descend about his brows,</a>
<a id='line_4915'>  A rattling tempest, and a hail of blows.</a>
<a id='line_4916'>  But now the prince, who saw the wild increase</a>
<a id='line_4917'>  Of wounds, commands the combatants to cease,</a>
<a id='line_4918'>  And bounds Entellus' wrath, and bids the peace.</a>
<a id='line_4919'>  First to the Trojan, spent with toil, he came,</a>
<a id='line_4920'>  And sooth'd his sorrow for the suffer'd shame.</a>
<a id='line_4921'>  "What fury seiz'd my friend? The gods," said he,</a>
<a id='line_4922'>  "To him propitious, and averse to thee,</a>
<a id='line_4923'>  Have giv'n his arm superior force to thine.</a>
<a id='line_4924'>  'T is madness to contend with strength divine."</a>
<a id='line_4925'>  The gauntlet fight thus ended, from the shore</a>
<a id='line_4926'>  His faithful friends unhappy Dares bore:</a>
<a id='line_4927'>  His mouth and nostrils pour'd a purple flood,</a>
<a id='line_4928'>  And pounded teeth came rushing with his blood.</a>
<a id='line_4929'>  Faintly he stagger'd thro' the hissing throng,</a>
<a id='line_4930'>  And hung his head, and trail'd his legs along.</a>
<a id='line_4931'>  The sword and casque are carried by his train;</a>
<a id='line_4932'>  But with his foe the palm and ox remain.</a>
<a id='line_4933'></a>
<a id='line_4934'>  The champion, then, before Aeneas came,</a>
<a id='line_4935'>  Proud of his prize, but prouder of his fame:</a>
<a id='line_4936'>  "O goddess-born, and you, Dardanian host,</a>
<a id='line_4937'>  Mark with attention, and forgive my boast;</a>
<a id='line_4938'>  Learn what I was, by what remains; and know</a>
<a id='line_4939'>  From what impending fate you sav'd my foe."</a>
<a id='line_4940'>  Sternly he spoke, and then confronts the bull;</a>
<a id='line_4941'>  And, on his ample forehead aiming full,</a>
<a id='line_4942'>  The deadly stroke, descending, pierc'd the skull.</a>
<a id='line_4943'>  Down drops the beast, nor needs a second wound,</a>
<a id='line_4944'>  But sprawls in pangs of death, and spurns the ground.</a>
<a id='line_4945'>  Then, thus: "In Dares' stead I offer this.</a>
<a id='line_4946'>  Eryx, accept a nobler sacrifice;</a>
<a id='line_4947'>  Take the last gift my wither'd arms can yield:</a>
<a id='line_4948'>  Thy gauntlets I resign, and here renounce the field."</a>
<a id='line_4949'></a>
<a id='line_4950'>  This done, Aeneas orders, for the close,</a>
<a id='line_4951'>  The strife of archers with contending bows.</a>
<a id='line_4952'>  The mast Sergesthus' shatter'd galley bore</a>
<a id='line_4953'>  With his own hands he raises on the shore.</a>
<a id='line_4954'>  A flutt'ring dove upon the top they tie,</a>
<a id='line_4955'>  The living mark at which their arrows fly.</a>
<a id='line_4956'>  The rival archers in a line advance,</a>
<a id='line_4957'>  Their turn of shooting to receive from chance.</a>
<a id='line_4958'>  A helmet holds their names; the lots are drawn:</a>
<a id='line_4959'>  On the first scroll was read Hippocoon.</a>
<a id='line_4960'>  The people shout. Upon the next was found</a>
<a id='line_4961'>  Young Mnestheus, late with naval honors crown'd.</a>
<a id='line_4962'>  The third contain'd Eurytion's noble name,</a>
<a id='line_4963'>  Thy brother, Pandarus, and next in fame,</a>
<a id='line_4964'>  Whom Pallas urg'd the treaty to confound,</a>
<a id='line_4965'>  And send among the Greeks a feather'd wound.</a>
<a id='line_4966'>  Acestes in the bottom last remain'd,</a>
<a id='line_4967'>  Whom not his age from youthful sports restrain'd.</a>
<a id='line_4968'>  Soon all with vigor bend their trusty bows,</a>
<a id='line_4969'>  And from the quiver each his arrow chose.</a>
<a id='line_4970'>  Hippocoon's was the first: with forceful sway</a>
<a id='line_4971'>  It flew, and, whizzing, cut the liquid way.</a>
<a id='line_4972'>  Fix'd in the mast the feather'd weapon stands:</a>
<a id='line_4973'>  The fearful pigeon flutters in her bands,</a>
<a id='line_4974'>  And the tree trembled, and the shouting cries</a>
<a id='line_4975'>  Of the pleas'd people rend the vaulted skies.</a>
<a id='line_4976'>  Then Mnestheus to the head his arrow drove,</a>
<a id='line_4977'>  With lifted eyes, and took his aim above,</a>
<a id='line_4978'>  But made a glancing shot, and missed the dove;</a>
<a id='line_4979'>  Yet miss'd so narrow, that he cut the cord</a>
<a id='line_4980'>  Which fasten'd by the foot the flitting bird.</a>
<a id='line_4981'>  The captive thus releas'd, away she flies,</a>
<a id='line_4982'>  And beats with clapping wings the yielding skies.</a>
<a id='line_4983'>  His bow already bent, Eurytion stood;</a>
<a id='line_4984'>  And, having first invok'd his brother god,</a>
<a id='line_4985'>  His winged shaft with eager haste he sped.</a>
<a id='line_4986'>  The fatal message reach'd her as she fled:</a>
<a id='line_4987'>  She leaves her life aloft; she strikes the ground,</a>
<a id='line_4988'>  And renders back the weapon in the wound.</a>
<a id='line_4989'>  Acestes, grudging at his lot, remains,</a>
<a id='line_4990'>  Without a prize to gratify his pains.</a>
<a id='line_4991'>  Yet, shooting upward, sends his shaft, to show</a>
<a id='line_4992'>  An archer's art, and boast his twanging bow.</a>
<a id='line_4993'>  The feather'd arrow gave a dire portent,</a>
<a id='line_4994'>  And latter augurs judge from this event.</a>
<a id='line_4995'>  Chaf'd by the speed, it fir'd; and, as it flew,</a>
<a id='line_4996'>  A trail of following flames ascending drew:</a>
<a id='line_4997'>  Kindling they mount, and mark the shiny way;</a>
<a id='line_4998'>  Across the skies as falling meteors play,</a>
<a id='line_4999'>  And vanish into wind, or in a blaze decay.</a>
<a id='line_5000'>  The Trojans and Sicilians wildly stare,</a>
<a id='line_5001'>  And, trembling, turn their wonder into pray'r.</a>
<a id='line_5002'>  The Dardan prince put on a smiling face,</a>
<a id='line_5003'>  And strain'd Acestes with a close embrace;</a>
<a id='line_5004'>  Then, hon'ring him with gifts above the rest,</a>
<a id='line_5005'>  Turn'd the bad omen, nor his fears confess'd.</a>
<a id='line_5006'>  "The gods," said he, "this miracle have wrought,</a>
<a id='line_5007'>  And order'd you the prize without the lot.</a>
<a id='line_5008'>  Accept this goblet, rough with figur'd gold,</a>
<a id='line_5009'>  Which Thracian Cisseus gave my sire of old:</a>
<a id='line_5010'>  This pledge of ancient amity receive,</a>
<a id='line_5011'>  Which to my second sire I justly give."</a>
<a id='line_5012'>  He said, and, with the trumpets' cheerful sound,</a>
<a id='line_5013'>  Proclaim'd him victor, and with laurel-crown'd.</a>
<a id='line_5014'>  Nor good Eurytion envied him the prize,</a>
<a id='line_5015'>  Tho' he transfix'd the pigeon in the skies.</a>
<a id='line_5016'>  Who cut the line, with second gifts was grac'd;</a>
<a id='line_5017'>  The third was his whose arrow pierc'd the mast.</a>
<a id='line_5018'></a>
<a id='line_5019'>  The chief, before the games were wholly done,</a>
<a id='line_5020'>  Call'd Periphantes, tutor to his son,</a>
<a id='line_5021'>  And whisper'd thus: "With speed Ascanius find;</a>
<a id='line_5022'>  And, if his childish troop be ready join'd,</a>
<a id='line_5023'>  On horseback let him grace his grandsire's day,</a>
<a id='line_5024'>  And lead his equals arm'd in just array."</a>
<a id='line_5025'>  He said; and, calling out, the cirque he clears.</a>
<a id='line_5026'>  The crowd withdrawn, an open plain appears.</a>
<a id='line_5027'>  And now the noble youths, of form divine,</a>
<a id='line_5028'>  Advance before their fathers, in a line;</a>
<a id='line_5029'>  The riders grace the steeds; the steeds with glory shine.</a>
<a id='line_5030'></a>
<a id='line_5031'>  Thus marching on in military pride,</a>
<a id='line_5032'>  Shouts of applause resound from side to side.</a>
<a id='line_5033'>  Their casques adorn'd with laurel wreaths they wear,</a>
<a id='line_5034'>  Each brandishing aloft a cornel spear.</a>
<a id='line_5035'>  Some at their backs their gilded quivers bore;</a>
<a id='line_5036'>  Their chains of burnish'd gold hung down before.</a>
<a id='line_5037'>  Three graceful troops they form'd upon the green;</a>
<a id='line_5038'>  Three graceful leaders at their head were seen;</a>
<a id='line_5039'>  Twelve follow'd ev'ry chief, and left a space between.</a>
<a id='line_5040'>  The first young Priam led; a lovely boy,</a>
<a id='line_5041'>  Whose grandsire was th' unhappy king of Troy;</a>
<a id='line_5042'>  His race in after times was known to fame,</a>
<a id='line_5043'>  New honors adding to the Latian name;</a>
<a id='line_5044'>  And well the royal boy his Thracian steed became.</a>
<a id='line_5045'>  White were the fetlocks of his feet before,</a>
<a id='line_5046'>  And on his front a snowy star he bore.</a>
<a id='line_5047'>  Then beauteous Atys, with Iulus bred,</a>
<a id='line_5048'>  Of equal age, the second squadron led.</a>
<a id='line_5049'>  The last in order, but the first in place,</a>
<a id='line_5050'>  First in the lovely features of his face,</a>
<a id='line_5051'>  Rode fair Ascanius on a fiery steed,</a>
<a id='line_5052'>  Queen Dido's gift, and of the Tyrian breed.</a>
<a id='line_5053'>  Sure coursers for the rest the king ordains,</a>
<a id='line_5054'>  With golden bits adorn'd, and purple reins.</a>
<a id='line_5055'></a>
<a id='line_5056'>  The pleas'd spectators peals of shouts renew,</a>
<a id='line_5057'>  And all the parents in the children view;</a>
<a id='line_5058'>  Their make, their motions, and their sprightly grace,</a>
<a id='line_5059'>  And hopes and fears alternate in their face.</a>
<a id='line_5060'></a>
<a id='line_5061'>  Th' unfledg'd commanders and their martial train</a>
<a id='line_5062'>  First make the circuit of the sandy plain</a>
<a id='line_5063'>  Around their sires, and, at th' appointed sign,</a>
<a id='line_5064'>  Drawn up in beauteous order, form a line.</a>
<a id='line_5065'>  The second signal sounds, the troop divides</a>
<a id='line_5066'>  In three distinguish'd parts, with three distinguish'd guides</a>
<a id='line_5067'>  Again they close, and once again disjoin;</a>
<a id='line_5068'>  In troop to troop oppos'd, and line to line.</a>
<a id='line_5069'>  They meet; they wheel; they throw their darts afar</a>
<a id='line_5070'>  With harmless rage and well-dissembled war.</a>
<a id='line_5071'>  Then in a round the mingled bodies run:</a>
<a id='line_5072'>  Flying they follow, and pursuing shun;</a>
<a id='line_5073'>  Broken, they break; and, rallying, they renew</a>
<a id='line_5074'>  In other forms the military shew.</a>
<a id='line_5075'>  At last, in order, undiscern'd they join,</a>
<a id='line_5076'>  And march together in a friendly line.</a>
<a id='line_5077'>  And, as the Cretan labyrinth of old,</a>
<a id='line_5078'>  With wand'ring ways and many a winding fold,</a>
<a id='line_5079'>  Involv'd the weary feet, without redress,</a>
<a id='line_5080'>  In a round error, which denied recess;</a>
<a id='line_5081'>  So fought the Trojan boys in warlike play,</a>
<a id='line_5082'>  Turn'd and return'd, and still a diff'rent way.</a>
<a id='line_5083'>  Thus dolphins in the deep each other chase</a>
<a id='line_5084'>  In circles, when they swim around the wat'ry race.</a>
<a id='line_5085'>  This game, these carousels, Ascanius taught;</a>
<a id='line_5086'>  And, building Alba, to the Latins brought;</a>
<a id='line_5087'>  Shew'd what he learn'd: the Latin sires impart</a>
<a id='line_5088'>  To their succeeding sons the graceful art;</a>
<a id='line_5089'>  From these imperial Rome receiv'd the game,</a>
<a id='line_5090'>  Which Troy, the youths the Trojan troop, they name.</a>
<a id='line_5091'></a>
<a id='line_5092'>  Thus far the sacred sports they celebrate:</a>
<a id='line_5093'>  But Fortune soon resum'd her ancient hate;</a>
<a id='line_5094'>  For, while they pay the dead his annual dues,</a>
<a id='line_5095'>  Those envied rites Saturnian Juno views;</a>
<a id='line_5096'>  And sends the goddess of the various bow,</a>
<a id='line_5097'>  To try new methods of revenge below;</a>
<a id='line_5098'>  Supplies the winds to wing her airy way,</a>
<a id='line_5099'>  Where in the port secure the navy lay.</a>
<a id='line_5100'>  Swiftly fair Iris down her arch descends,</a>
<a id='line_5101'>  And, undiscern'd, her fatal voyage ends.</a>
<a id='line_5102'>  She saw the gath'ring crowd; and, gliding thence,</a>
<a id='line_5103'>  The desart shore, and fleet without defense.</a>
<a id='line_5104'>  The Trojan matrons, on the sands alone,</a>
<a id='line_5105'>  With sighs and tears Anchises' death bemoan;</a>
<a id='line_5106'>  Then, turning to the sea their weeping eyes,</a>
<a id='line_5107'>  Their pity to themselves renews their cries.</a>
<a id='line_5108'>  "Alas!" said one, "what oceans yet remain</a>
<a id='line_5109'>  For us to sail! what labors to sustain!"</a>
<a id='line_5110'>  All take the word, and, with a gen'ral groan,</a>
<a id='line_5111'>  Implore the gods for peace, and places of their own.</a>
<a id='line_5112'></a>
<a id='line_5113'>  The goddess, great in mischief, views their pains,</a>
<a id='line_5114'>  And in a woman's form her heav'nly limbs restrains.</a>
<a id='line_5115'>  In face and shape old Beroe she became,</a>
<a id='line_5116'>  Doryclus' wife, a venerable dame,</a>
<a id='line_5117'>  Once blest with riches, and a mother's name.</a>
<a id='line_5118'>  Thus chang'd, amidst the crying crowd she ran,</a>
<a id='line_5119'>  Mix'd with the matrons, and these words began:</a>
<a id='line_5120'>  "O wretched we, whom not the Grecian pow'r,</a>
<a id='line_5121'>  Nor flames, destroy'd, in Troy's unhappy hour!</a>
<a id='line_5122'>  O wretched we, reserv'd by cruel fate,</a>
<a id='line_5123'>  Beyond the ruins of the sinking state!</a>
<a id='line_5124'>  Now sev'n revolving years are wholly run,</a>
<a id='line_5125'>  Since this improsp'rous voyage we begun;</a>
<a id='line_5126'>  Since, toss'd from shores to shores, from lands to lands,</a>
<a id='line_5127'>  Inhospitable rocks and barren sands,</a>
<a id='line_5128'>  Wand'ring in exile thro' the stormy sea,</a>
<a id='line_5129'>  We search in vain for flying Italy.</a>
<a id='line_5130'>  Now cast by fortune on this kindred land,</a>
<a id='line_5131'>  What should our rest and rising walls withstand,</a>
<a id='line_5132'>  Or hinder here to fix our banish'd band?</a>
<a id='line_5133'>  O country lost, and gods redeem'd in vain,</a>
<a id='line_5134'>  If still in endless exile we remain!</a>
<a id='line_5135'>  Shall we no more the Trojan walls renew,</a>
<a id='line_5136'>  Or streams of some dissembled Simois view!</a>
<a id='line_5137'>  Haste, join with me, th' unhappy fleet consume!</a>
<a id='line_5138'>  Cassandra bids; and I declare her doom.</a>
<a id='line_5139'>  In sleep I saw her; she supplied my hands</a>
<a id='line_5140'>  (For this I more than dreamt) with flaming brands:</a>
<a id='line_5141'>  'With these,' said she, 'these wand'ring ships destroy:</a>
<a id='line_5142'>  These are your fatal seats, and this your Troy.'</a>
<a id='line_5143'>  Time calls you now; the precious hour employ:</a>
<a id='line_5144'>  Slack not the good presage, while Heav'n inspires</a>
<a id='line_5145'>  Our minds to dare, and gives the ready fires.</a>
<a id='line_5146'>  See! Neptune's altars minister their brands:</a>
<a id='line_5147'>  The god is pleas'd; the god supplies our hands."</a>
<a id='line_5148'>  Then from the pile a flaming fire she drew,</a>
<a id='line_5149'>  And, toss'd in air, amidst the galleys threw.</a>
<a id='line_5150'></a>
<a id='line_5151'>  Wrapp'd in amaze, the matrons wildly stare:</a>
<a id='line_5152'>  Then Pyrgo, reverenc'd for her hoary hair,</a>
<a id='line_5153'>  Pyrgo, the nurse of Priam's num'rous race:</a>
<a id='line_5154'>  "No Beroe this, tho' she belies her face!</a>
<a id='line_5155'>  What terrors from her frowning front arise!</a>
<a id='line_5156'>  Behold a goddess in her ardent eyes!</a>
<a id='line_5157'>  What rays around her heav'nly face are seen!</a>
<a id='line_5158'>  Mark her majestic voice, and more than mortal mien!</a>
<a id='line_5159'>  Beroe but now I left, whom, pin'd with pain,</a>
<a id='line_5160'>  Her age and anguish from these rites detain,"</a>
<a id='line_5161'>  She said. The matrons, seiz'd with new amaze,</a>
<a id='line_5162'>  Roll their malignant eyes, and on the navy gaze.</a>
<a id='line_5163'>  They fear, and hope, and neither part obey:</a>
<a id='line_5164'>  They hope the fated land, but fear the fatal way.</a>
<a id='line_5165'>  The goddess, having done her task below,</a>
<a id='line_5166'>  Mounts up on equal wings, and bends her painted bow.</a>
<a id='line_5167'>  Struck with the sight, and seiz'd with rage divine,</a>
<a id='line_5168'>  The matrons prosecute their mad design:</a>
<a id='line_5169'>  They shriek aloud; they snatch, with impious hands,</a>
<a id='line_5170'>  The food of altars; fires and flaming brands.</a>
<a id='line_5171'>  Green boughs and saplings, mingled in their haste,</a>
<a id='line_5172'>  And smoking torches, on the ships they cast.</a>
<a id='line_5173'>  The flame, unstopp'd at first, more fury gains,</a>
<a id='line_5174'>  And Vulcan rides at large with loosen'd reins:</a>
<a id='line_5175'>  Triumphant to the painted sterns he soars,</a>
<a id='line_5176'>  And seizes, in this way, the banks and crackling oars.</a>
<a id='line_5177'>  Eumelus was the first the news to bear,</a>
<a id='line_5178'>  While yet they crowd the rural theater.</a>
<a id='line_5179'>  Then, what they hear, is witness'd by their eyes:</a>
<a id='line_5180'>  A storm of sparkles and of flames arise.</a>
<a id='line_5181'>  Ascanius took th' alarm, while yet he led</a>
<a id='line_5182'>  His early warriors on his prancing steed,</a>
<a id='line_5183'>  And, spurring on, his equals soon o'erpass'd;</a>
<a id='line_5184'>  Nor could his frighted friends reclaim his haste.</a>
<a id='line_5185'>  Soon as the royal youth appear'd in view,</a>
<a id='line_5186'>  He sent his voice before him as he flew:</a>
<a id='line_5187'>  "What madness moves you, matrons, to destroy</a>
<a id='line_5188'>  The last remainders of unhappy Troy!</a>
<a id='line_5189'>  Not hostile fleets, but your own hopes, you burn,</a>
<a id='line_5190'>  And on your friends your fatal fury turn.</a>
<a id='line_5191'>  Behold your own Ascanius!" While he said,</a>
<a id='line_5192'>  He drew his glitt'ring helmet from his head,</a>
<a id='line_5193'>  In which the youths to sportful arms he led.</a>
<a id='line_5194'>  By this, Aeneas and his train appear;</a>
<a id='line_5195'>  And now the women, seiz'd with shame and fear,</a>
<a id='line_5196'>  Dispers'd, to woods and caverns take their flight,</a>
<a id='line_5197'>  Abhor their actions, and avoid the light;</a>
<a id='line_5198'>  Their friends acknowledge, and their error find,</a>
<a id='line_5199'>  And shake the goddess from their alter'd mind.</a>
<a id='line_5200'></a>
<a id='line_5201'>  Not so the raging fires their fury cease,</a>
<a id='line_5202'>  But, lurking in the seams, with seeming peace,</a>
<a id='line_5203'>  Work on their way amid the smold'ring tow,</a>
<a id='line_5204'>  Sure in destruction, but in motion slow.</a>
<a id='line_5205'>  The silent plague thro' the green timber eats,</a>
<a id='line_5206'>  And vomits out a tardy flame by fits.</a>
<a id='line_5207'>  Down to the keels, and upward to the sails,</a>
<a id='line_5208'>  The fire descends, or mounts, but still prevails;</a>
<a id='line_5209'>  Nor buckets pour'd, nor strength of human hand,</a>
<a id='line_5210'>  Can the victorious element withstand.</a>
<a id='line_5211'></a>
<a id='line_5212'>  The pious hero rends his robe, and throws</a>
<a id='line_5213'>  To heav'n his hands, and with his hands his vows.</a>
<a id='line_5214'>  "O Jove," he cried, "if pray'rs can yet have place;</a>
<a id='line_5215'>  If thou abhorr'st not all the Dardan race;</a>
<a id='line_5216'>  If any spark of pity still remain;</a>
<a id='line_5217'>  If gods are gods, and not invok'd in vain;</a>
<a id='line_5218'>  Yet spare the relics of the Trojan train!</a>
<a id='line_5219'>  Yet from the flames our burning vessels free,</a>
<a id='line_5220'>  Or let thy fury fall alone on me!</a>
<a id='line_5221'>  At this devoted head thy thunder throw,</a>
<a id='line_5222'>  And send the willing sacrifice below!"</a>
<a id='line_5223'></a>
<a id='line_5224'>  Scarce had he said, when southern storms arise:</a>
<a id='line_5225'>  From pole to pole the forky lightning flies;</a>
<a id='line_5226'>  Loud rattling shakes the mountains and the plain;</a>
<a id='line_5227'>  Heav'n bellies downward, and descends in rain.</a>
<a id='line_5228'>  Whole sheets of water from the clouds are sent,</a>
<a id='line_5229'>  Which, hissing thro' the planks, the flames prevent,</a>
<a id='line_5230'>  And stop the fiery pest. Four ships alone</a>
<a id='line_5231'>  Burn to the waist, and for the fleet atone.</a>
<a id='line_5232'></a>
<a id='line_5233'>  But doubtful thoughts the hero's heart divide;</a>
<a id='line_5234'>  If he should still in Sicily reside,</a>
<a id='line_5235'>  Forgetful of his fates, or tempt the main,</a>
<a id='line_5236'>  In hope the promis'd Italy to gain.</a>
<a id='line_5237'>  Then Nautes, old and wise, to whom alone</a>
<a id='line_5238'>  The will of Heav'n by Pallas was foreshown;</a>
<a id='line_5239'>  Vers'd in portents, experienc'd, and inspir'd</a>
<a id='line_5240'>  To tell events, and what the fates requir'd;</a>
<a id='line_5241'>  Thus while he stood, to neither part inclin'd,</a>
<a id='line_5242'>  With cheerful words reliev'd his lab'ring mind:</a>
<a id='line_5243'>  "O goddess-born, resign'd in ev'ry state,</a>
<a id='line_5244'>  With patience bear, with prudence push your fate.</a>
<a id='line_5245'>  By suff'ring well, our Fortune we subdue;</a>
<a id='line_5246'>  Fly when she frowns, and, when she calls, pursue.</a>
<a id='line_5247'>  Your friend Acestes is of Trojan kind;</a>
<a id='line_5248'>  To him disclose the secrets of your mind:</a>
<a id='line_5249'>  Trust in his hands your old and useless train;</a>
<a id='line_5250'>  Too num'rous for the ships which yet remain:</a>
<a id='line_5251'>  The feeble, old, indulgent of their ease,</a>
<a id='line_5252'>  The dames who dread the dangers of the seas,</a>
<a id='line_5253'>  With all the dastard crew, who dare not stand</a>
<a id='line_5254'>  The shock of battle with your foes by land.</a>
<a id='line_5255'>  Here you may build a common town for all,</a>
<a id='line_5256'>  And, from Acestes' name, Acesta call."</a>
<a id='line_5257'>  The reasons, with his friend's experience join'd,</a>
<a id='line_5258'>  Encourag'd much, but more disturb'd his mind.</a>
<a id='line_5259'></a>
<a id='line_5260'>  'T was dead of night; when to his slumb'ring eyes</a>
<a id='line_5261'>  His father's shade descended from the skies,</a>
<a id='line_5262'>  And thus he spoke: "O more than vital breath,</a>
<a id='line_5263'>  Lov'd while I liv'd, and dear ev'n after death;</a>
<a id='line_5264'>  O son, in various toils and troubles toss'd,</a>
<a id='line_5265'>  The King of Heav'n employs my careful ghost</a>
<a id='line_5266'>  On his commands: the god, who sav'd from fire</a>
<a id='line_5267'>  Your flaming fleet, and heard your just desire.</a>
<a id='line_5268'>  The wholesome counsel of your friend receive,</a>
<a id='line_5269'>  And here the coward train and woman leave:</a>
<a id='line_5270'>  The chosen youth, and those who nobly dare,</a>
<a id='line_5271'>  Transport, to tempt the dangers of the war.</a>
<a id='line_5272'>  The stern Italians will their courage try;</a>
<a id='line_5273'>  Rough are their manners, and their minds are high.</a>
<a id='line_5274'>  But first to Pluto's palace you shall go,</a>
<a id='line_5275'>  And seek my shade among the blest below:</a>
<a id='line_5276'>  For not with impious ghosts my soul remains,</a>
<a id='line_5277'>  Nor suffers with the damn'd perpetual pains,</a>
<a id='line_5278'>  But breathes the living air of soft Elysian plains.</a>
<a id='line_5279'>  The chaste Sibylla shall your steps convey,</a>
<a id='line_5280'>  And blood of offer'd victims free the way.</a>
<a id='line_5281'>  There shall you know what realms the gods assign,</a>
<a id='line_5282'>  And learn the fates and fortunes of your line.</a>
<a id='line_5283'>  But now, farewell! I vanish with the night,</a>
<a id='line_5284'>  And feel the blast of heav'n's approaching light."</a>
<a id='line_5285'>  He said, and mix'd with shades, and took his airy flight.</a>
<a id='line_5286'>  "Whither so fast?" the filial duty cried;</a>
<a id='line_5287'>  "And why, ah why, the wish'd embrace denied?"</a>
<a id='line_5288'></a>
<a id='line_5289'>  He said, and rose; as holy zeal inspires,</a>
<a id='line_5290'>  He rakes hot embers, and renews the fires;</a>
<a id='line_5291'>  His country gods and Vesta then adores</a>
<a id='line_5292'>  With cakes and incense, and their aid implores.</a>
<a id='line_5293'>  Next, for his friends and royal host he sent,</a>
<a id='line_5294'>  Reveal'd his vision, and the gods' intent,</a>
<a id='line_5295'>  With his own purpose. All, without delay,</a>
<a id='line_5296'>  The will of Jove, and his desires obey.</a>
<a id='line_5297'>  They list with women each degenerate name,</a>
<a id='line_5298'>  Who dares not hazard life for future fame.</a>
<a id='line_5299'>  These they cashier: the brave remaining few,</a>
<a id='line_5300'>  Oars, banks, and cables, half consum'd, renew.</a>
<a id='line_5301'>  The prince designs a city with the plow;</a>
<a id='line_5302'>  The lots their sev'ral tenements allow.</a>
<a id='line_5303'>  This part is nam'd from Ilium, that from Troy,</a>
<a id='line_5304'>  And the new king ascends the throne with joy;</a>
<a id='line_5305'>  A chosen senate from the people draws;</a>
<a id='line_5306'>  Appoints the judges, and ordains the laws.</a>
<a id='line_5307'>  Then, on the top of Eryx, they begin</a>
<a id='line_5308'>  A rising temple to the Paphian queen.</a>
<a id='line_5309'>  Anchises, last, is honor'd as a god;</a>
<a id='line_5310'>  A priest is added, annual gifts bestow'd,</a>
<a id='line_5311'>  And groves are planted round his blest abode.</a>
<a id='line_5312'>  Nine days they pass in feasts, their temples crown'd;</a>
<a id='line_5313'>  And fumes of incense in the fanes abound.</a>
<a id='line_5314'>  Then from the south arose a gentle breeze</a>
<a id='line_5315'>  That curl'd the smoothness of the glassy seas;</a>
<a id='line_5316'>  The rising winds a ruffling gale afford,</a>
<a id='line_5317'>  And call the merry mariners aboard.</a>
<a id='line_5318'></a>
<a id='line_5319'>  Now loud laments along the shores resound,</a>
<a id='line_5320'>  Of parting friends in close embraces bound.</a>
<a id='line_5321'>  The trembling women, the degenerate train,</a>
<a id='line_5322'>  Who shunn'd the frightful dangers of the main,</a>
<a id='line_5323'>  Ev'n those desire to sail, and take their share</a>
<a id='line_5324'>  Of the rough passage and the promis'd war:</a>
<a id='line_5325'>  Whom good Aeneas cheers, and recommends</a>
<a id='line_5326'>  To their new master's care his fearful friends.</a>
<a id='line_5327'>  On Eryx's altars three fat calves he lays;</a>
<a id='line_5328'>  A lamb new-fallen to the stormy seas;</a>
<a id='line_5329'>  Then slips his haulsers, and his anchors weighs.</a>
<a id='line_5330'>  High on the deck the godlike hero stands,</a>
<a id='line_5331'>  With olive crown'd, a charger in his hands;</a>
<a id='line_5332'>  Then cast the reeking entrails in the brine,</a>
<a id='line_5333'>  And pour'd the sacrifice of purple wine.</a>
<a id='line_5334'>  Fresh gales arise; with equal strokes they vie,</a>
<a id='line_5335'>  And brush the buxom seas, and o'er the billows fly.</a>
<a id='line_5336'></a>
<a id='line_5337'>  Meantime the mother goddess, full of fears,</a>
<a id='line_5338'>  To Neptune thus address'd, with tender tears:</a>
<a id='line_5339'>  "The pride of Jove's imperious queen, the rage,</a>
<a id='line_5340'>  The malice which no suff'rings can assuage,</a>
<a id='line_5341'>  Compel me to these pray'rs; since neither fate,</a>
<a id='line_5342'>  Nor time, nor pity, can remove her hate:</a>
<a id='line_5343'>  Ev'n Jove is thwarted by his haughty wife;</a>
<a id='line_5344'>  Still vanquish'd, yet she still renews the strife.</a>
<a id='line_5345'>  As if 't were little to consume the town</a>
<a id='line_5346'>  Which aw'd the world, and wore th' imperial crown,</a>
<a id='line_5347'>  She prosecutes the ghost of Troy with pains,</a>
<a id='line_5348'>  And gnaws, ev'n to the bones, the last remains.</a>
<a id='line_5349'>  Let her the causes of her hatred tell;</a>
<a id='line_5350'>  But you can witness its effects too well.</a>
<a id='line_5351'>  You saw the storm she rais'd on Libyan floods,</a>
<a id='line_5352'>  That mix'd the mounting billows with the clouds;</a>
<a id='line_5353'>  When, bribing Aeolus, she shook the main,</a>
<a id='line_5354'>  And mov'd rebellion in your wat'ry reign.</a>
<a id='line_5355'>  With fury she possess'd the Dardan dames,</a>
<a id='line_5356'>  To burn their fleet with execrable flames,</a>
<a id='line_5357'>  And forc'd Aeneas, when his ships were lost,</a>
<a id='line_5358'>  To leave his foll'wers on a foreign coast.</a>
<a id='line_5359'>  For what remains, your godhead I implore,</a>
<a id='line_5360'>  And trust my son to your protecting pow'r.</a>
<a id='line_5361'>  If neither Jove's nor Fate's decree withstand,</a>
<a id='line_5362'>  Secure his passage to the Latian land."</a>
<a id='line_5363'></a>
<a id='line_5364'>  Then thus the mighty Ruler of the Main:</a>
<a id='line_5365'>  "What may not Venus hope from Neptune's reign?</a>
<a id='line_5366'>  My kingdom claims your birth; my late defense</a>
<a id='line_5367'>  Of your indanger'd fleet may claim your confidence.</a>
<a id='line_5368'>  Nor less by land than sea my deeds declare</a>
<a id='line_5369'>  How much your lov'd Aeneas is my care.</a>
<a id='line_5370'>  Thee, Xanthus, and thee, Simois, I attest.</a>
<a id='line_5371'>  Your Trojan troops when proud Achilles press'd,</a>
<a id='line_5372'>  And drove before him headlong on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_5373'>  And dash'd against the walls the trembling train;</a>
<a id='line_5374'>  When floods were fill'd with bodies of the slain;</a>
<a id='line_5375'>  When crimson Xanthus, doubtful of his way,</a>
<a id='line_5376'>  Stood up on ridges to behold the sea;</a>
<a id='line_5377'>  (New heaps came tumbling in, and chok'd his way;)</a>
<a id='line_5378'>  When your Aeneas fought, but fought with odds</a>
<a id='line_5379'>  Of force unequal, and unequal gods;</a>
<a id='line_5380'>  I spread a cloud before the victor's sight,</a>
<a id='line_5381'>  Sustain'd the vanquish'd, and secur'd his flight;</a>
<a id='line_5382'>  Ev'n then secur'd him, when I sought with joy</a>
<a id='line_5383'>  The vow'd destruction of ungrateful Troy.</a>
<a id='line_5384'>  My will's the same: fair goddess, fear no more,</a>
<a id='line_5385'>  Your fleet shall safely gain the Latian shore;</a>
<a id='line_5386'>  Their lives are giv'n; one destin'd head alone</a>
<a id='line_5387'>  Shall perish, and for multitudes atone."</a>
<a id='line_5388'>  Thus having arm'd with hopes her anxious mind,</a>
<a id='line_5389'>  His finny team Saturnian Neptune join'd,</a>
<a id='line_5390'>  Then adds the foamy bridle to their jaws,</a>
<a id='line_5391'>  And to the loosen'd reins permits the laws.</a>
<a id='line_5392'>  High on the waves his azure car he guides;</a>
<a id='line_5393'>  Its axles thunder, and the sea subsides,</a>
<a id='line_5394'>  And the smooth ocean rolls her silent tides.</a>
<a id='line_5395'>  The tempests fly before their father's face,</a>
<a id='line_5396'>  Trains of inferior gods his triumph grace,</a>
<a id='line_5397'>  And monster whales before their master play,</a>
<a id='line_5398'>  And choirs of Tritons crowd the wat'ry way.</a>
<a id='line_5399'>  The marshal'd pow'rs in equal troops divide</a>
<a id='line_5400'>  To right and left; the gods his better side</a>
<a id='line_5401'>  Inclose, and on the worse the Nymphs and Nereids ride.</a>
<a id='line_5402'></a>
<a id='line_5403'>  Now smiling hope, with sweet vicissitude,</a>
<a id='line_5404'>  Within the hero's mind his joys renew'd.</a>
<a id='line_5405'>  He calls to raise the masts, the sheets display;</a>
<a id='line_5406'>  The cheerful crew with diligence obey;</a>
<a id='line_5407'>  They scud before the wind, and sail in open sea.</a>
<a id='line_5408'>  Ahead of all the master pilot steers;</a>
<a id='line_5409'>  And, as he leads, the following navy veers.</a>
<a id='line_5410'>  The steeds of Night had travel'd half the sky,</a>
<a id='line_5411'>  The drowsy rowers on their benches lie,</a>
<a id='line_5412'>  When the soft God of Sleep, with easy flight,</a>
<a id='line_5413'>  Descends, and draws behind a trail of light.</a>
<a id='line_5414'>  Thou, Palinurus, art his destin'd prey;</a>
<a id='line_5415'>  To thee alone he takes his fatal way.</a>
<a id='line_5416'>  Dire dreams to thee, and iron sleep, he bears;</a>
<a id='line_5417'>  And, lighting on thy prow, the form of Phorbas wears.</a>
<a id='line_5418'>  Then thus the traitor god began his tale:</a>
<a id='line_5419'>  "The winds, my friend, inspire a pleasing gale;</a>
<a id='line_5420'>  The ships, without thy care, securely sail.</a>
<a id='line_5421'>  Now steal an hour of sweet repose; and I</a>
<a id='line_5422'>  Will take the rudder and thy room supply."</a>
<a id='line_5423'>  To whom the yawning pilot, half asleep:</a>
<a id='line_5424'>  "Me dost thou bid to trust the treach'rous deep,</a>
<a id='line_5425'>  The harlot smiles of her dissembling face,</a>
<a id='line_5426'>  And to her faith commit the Trojan race?</a>
<a id='line_5427'>  Shall I believe the Siren South again,</a>
<a id='line_5428'>  And, oft betray'd, not know the monster main?"</a>
<a id='line_5429'>  He said: his fasten'd hands the rudder keep,</a>
<a id='line_5430'>  And, fix'd on heav'n, his eyes repel invading sleep.</a>
<a id='line_5431'>  The god was wroth, and at his temples threw</a>
<a id='line_5432'>  A branch in Lethe dipp'd, and drunk with Stygian dew:</a>
<a id='line_5433'>  The pilot, vanquish'd by the pow'r divine,</a>
<a id='line_5434'>  Soon clos'd his swimming eyes, and lay supine.</a>
<a id='line_5435'>  Scarce were his limbs extended at their length,</a>
<a id='line_5436'>  The god, insulting with superior strength,</a>
<a id='line_5437'>  Fell heavy on him, plung'd him in the sea,</a>
<a id='line_5438'>  And, with the stern, the rudder tore away.</a>
<a id='line_5439'>  Headlong he fell, and, struggling in the main,</a>
<a id='line_5440'>  Cried out for helping hands, but cried in vain.</a>
<a id='line_5441'>  The victor daemon mounts obscure in air,</a>
<a id='line_5442'>  While the ship sails without the pilot's care.</a>
<a id='line_5443'>  On Neptune's faith the floating fleet relies;</a>
<a id='line_5444'>  But what the man forsook, the god supplies,</a>
<a id='line_5445'>  And o'er the dang'rous deep secure the navy flies;</a>
<a id='line_5446'>  Glides by the Sirens' cliffs, a shelfy coast,</a>
<a id='line_5447'>  Long infamous for ships and sailors lost,</a>
<a id='line_5448'>  And white with bones. Th' impetuous ocean roars,</a>
<a id='line_5449'>  And rocks rebellow from the sounding shores.</a>
<a id='line_5450'>  The watchful hero felt the knocks, and found</a>
<a id='line_5451'>  The tossing vessel sail'd on shoaly ground.</a>
<a id='line_5452'>  Sure of his pilot's loss, he takes himself</a>
<a id='line_5453'>  The helm, and steers aloof, and shuns the shelf.</a>
<a id='line_5454'>  Inly he griev'd, and, groaning from the breast,</a>
<a id='line_5455'>  Deplor'd his death; and thus his pain express'd:</a>
<a id='line_5456'>  "For faith repos'd on seas, and on the flatt'ring sky,</a>
<a id='line_5457'>  Thy naked corpse is doom'd on shores unknown to lie."</a>

<a id='line_5464'>  He said, and wept; then spread his sails before</a>
<a id='line_5465'>  The winds, and reach'd at length the Cumaean shore:</a>
<a id='line_5466'>  Their anchors dropp'd, his crew the vessels moor.</a>
<a id='line_5467'>  They turn their heads to sea, their sterns to land,</a>
<a id='line_5468'>  And greet with greedy joy th' Italian strand.</a>
<a id='line_5469'>  Some strike from clashing flints their fiery seed;</a>
<a id='line_5470'>  Some gather sticks, the kindled flames to feed,</a>

<a id='line_5477'>  Deep in a cave the Sibyl makes abode;</a>

<a id='line_5479'>  Thro' Trivia's grove they walk; and now behold,</a>

<a id='line_5481'>  When Daedalus, to fly the Cretan shore,</a>

<a id='line_5504'>  Here dwells the monster, hid from human view,</a>

<a id='line_5524'>  This said, the servants urge the sacred rites,</a>
<a id='line_5525'>  While to the temple she the prince invites.</a>
<a id='line_5526'>  A spacious cave, within its farmost part,</a>

<a id='line_5542'>  Her staring eyes with sparkling fury roll;</a>
<a id='line_5543'>  When all the god came rushing on her soul.</a>
<a id='line_5544'>  Swiftly she turn'd, and, foaming as she spoke:</a>
<a id='line_5545'>  "Why this delay?" she cried- "the pow'rs invoke!</a>
<a id='line_5546'>  Thy pray'rs alone can open this abode;</a>
<a id='line_5547'>  Else vain are my demands, and dumb the god."</a>
<a id='line_5548'></a>
<a id='line_5549'>  She said no more. The trembling Trojans hear,</a>
<a id='line_5550'>  O'erspread with a damp sweat and holy fear.</a>
<a id='line_5551'>  The prince himself, with awful dread possess'd,</a>
<a id='line_5552'>  His vows to great Apollo thus address'd:</a>
<a id='line_5553'>  "Indulgent god, propitious pow'r to Troy,</a>
<a id='line_5554'>  Swift to relieve, unwilling to destroy,</a>
<a id='line_5555'>  Directed by whose hand the Dardan dart</a>
<a id='line_5556'>  Pierc'd the proud Grecian's only mortal part:</a>
<a id='line_5557'>  Thus far, by fate's decrees and thy commands,</a>
<a id='line_5558'>  Thro' ambient seas and thro' devouring sands,</a>
<a id='line_5559'>  Our exil'd crew has sought th' Ausonian ground;</a>
<a id='line_5560'>  And now, at length, the flying coast is found.</a>
<a id='line_5561'>  Thus far the fate of Troy, from place to place,</a>
<a id='line_5562'>  With fury has pursued her wand'ring race.</a>
<a id='line_5563'>  Here cease, ye pow'rs, and let your vengeance end:</a>
<a id='line_5564'>  Troy is no more, and can no more offend.</a>
<a id='line_5565'>  And thou, O sacred maid, inspir'd to see</a>
<a id='line_5566'>  Th' event of things in dark futurity;</a>
<a id='line_5567'>  Give me what Heav'n has promis'd to my fate,</a>
<a id='line_5568'>  To conquer and command the Latian state;</a>
<a id='line_5569'>  To fix my wand'ring gods, and find a place</a>
<a id='line_5570'>  For the long exiles of the Trojan race.</a>
<a id='line_5571'>  Then shall my grateful hands a temple rear</a>
<a id='line_5572'>  To the twin gods, with vows and solemn pray'r;</a>
<a id='line_5573'>  And annual rites, and festivals, and games,</a>
<a id='line_5574'>  Shall be perform'd to their auspicious names.</a>
<a id='line_5575'>  Nor shalt thou want thy honors in my land;</a>
<a id='line_5576'>  For there thy faithful oracles shall stand,</a>
<a id='line_5577'>  Preserv'd in shrines; and ev'ry sacred lay,</a>
<a id='line_5578'>  Which, by thy mouth, Apollo shall convey:</a>
<a id='line_5579'>  All shall be treasur'd by a chosen train</a>
<a id='line_5580'>  Of holy priests, and ever shall remain.</a>
<a id='line_5581'>  But O! commit not thy prophetic mind</a>
<a id='line_5582'>  To flitting leaves, the sport of ev'ry wind,</a>
<a id='line_5583'>  Lest they disperse in air our empty fate;</a>
<a id='line_5584'>  Write not, but, what the pow'rs ordain, relate."</a>
<a id='line_5585'></a>
<a id='line_5586'>  Struggling in vain, impatient of her load,</a>
<a id='line_5587'>  And lab'ring underneath the pond'rous god,</a>
<a id='line_5588'>  The more she strove to shake him from her breast,</a>
<a id='line_5589'>  With more and far superior force he press'd;</a>
<a id='line_5590'>  Commands his entrance, and, without control,</a>
<a id='line_5591'>  Usurps her organs and inspires her soul.</a>
<a id='line_5592'>  Now, with a furious blast, the hundred doors</a>
<a id='line_5593'>  Ope of themselves; a rushing whirlwind roars</a>
<a id='line_5594'>  Within the cave, and Sibyl's voice restores:</a>
<a id='line_5595'>  "Escap'd the dangers of the wat'ry reign,</a>
<a id='line_5596'>  Yet more and greater ills by land remain.</a>
<a id='line_5597'>  The coast, so long desir'd (nor doubt th' event),</a>
<a id='line_5598'>  Thy troops shall reach, but, having reach'd, repent.</a>
<a id='line_5599'>  Wars, horrid wars, I view- a field of blood,</a>
<a id='line_5600'>  And Tiber rolling with a purple flood.</a>
<a id='line_5601'>  Simois nor Xanthus shall be wanting there:</a>
<a id='line_5602'>  A new Achilles shall in arms appear,</a>
<a id='line_5603'>  And he, too, goddess-born. Fierce Juno's hate,</a>
<a id='line_5604'>  Added to hostile force, shall urge thy fate.</a>
<a id='line_5605'>  To what strange nations shalt not thou resort,</a>
<a id='line_5606'>  Driv'n to solicit aid at ev'ry court!</a>
<a id='line_5607'>  The cause the same which Ilium once oppress'd;</a>
<a id='line_5608'>  A foreign mistress, and a foreign guest.</a>
<a id='line_5609'>  But thou, secure of soul, unbent with woes,</a>
<a id='line_5610'>  The more thy fortune frowns, the more oppose.</a>
<a id='line_5611'>  The dawnings of thy safety shall be shown</a>
<a id='line_5612'>  From whence thou least shalt hope, a Grecian town."</a>
<a id='line_5613'></a>
<a id='line_5614'>  Thus, from the dark recess, the Sibyl spoke,</a>
<a id='line_5615'>  And the resisting air the thunder broke;</a>
<a id='line_5616'>  The cave rebellow'd, and the temple shook.</a>
<a id='line_5617'>  Th' ambiguous god, who rul'd her lab'ring breast,</a>
<a id='line_5618'>  In these mysterious words his mind express'd;</a>
<a id='line_5619'>  Some truths reveal'd, in terms involv'd the rest.</a>
<a id='line_5620'>  At length her fury fell, her foaming ceas'd,</a>
<a id='line_5621'>  And, ebbing in her soul, the god decreas'd.</a>
<a id='line_5622'>  Then thus the chief: "No terror to my view,</a>
<a id='line_5623'>  No frightful face of danger can be new.</a>
<a id='line_5624'>  Inur'd to suffer, and resolv'd to dare,</a>
<a id='line_5625'>  The Fates, without my pow'r, shall be without my care.</a>
<a id='line_5626'>  This let me crave, since near your grove the road</a>
<a id='line_5627'>  To hell lies open, and the dark abode</a>
<a id='line_5628'>  Which Acheron surrounds, th' innavigable flood;</a>
<a id='line_5629'>  Conduct me thro' the regions void of light,</a>
<a id='line_5630'>  And lead me longing to my father's sight.</a>
<a id='line_5631'>  For him, a thousand dangers I have sought,</a>
<a id='line_5632'>  And, rushing where the thickest Grecians fought,</a>
<a id='line_5633'>  Safe on my back the sacred burthen brought.</a>
<a id='line_5634'>  He, for my sake, the raging ocean tried,</a>
<a id='line_5635'>  And wrath of Heav'n, my still auspicious guide,</a>
<a id='line_5636'>  And bore beyond the strength decrepid age supplied.</a>
<a id='line_5637'>  Oft, since he breath'd his last, in dead of night</a>
<a id='line_5638'>  His reverend image stood before my sight;</a>
<a id='line_5639'>  Enjoin'd to seek, below, his holy shade;</a>
<a id='line_5640'>  Conducted there by your unerring aid.</a>
<a id='line_5641'>  But you, if pious minds by pray'rs are won,</a>
<a id='line_5642'>  Oblige the father, and protect the son.</a>
<a id='line_5643'>  Yours is the pow'r; nor Proserpine in vain</a>
<a id='line_5644'>  Has made you priestess of her nightly reign.</a>
<a id='line_5645'>  If Orpheus, arm'd with his enchanting lyre,</a>
<a id='line_5646'>  The ruthless king with pity could inspire,</a>
<a id='line_5647'>  And from the shades below redeem his wife;</a>
<a id='line_5648'>  If Pollux, off'ring his alternate life,</a>
<a id='line_5649'>  Could free his brother, and can daily go</a>
<a id='line_5650'>  By turns aloft, by turns descend below-</a>
<a id='line_5651'>  Why name I Theseus, or his greater friend,</a>
<a id='line_5652'>  Who trod the downward path, and upward could ascend?</a>
<a id='line_5653'>  Not less than theirs from Jove my lineage came;</a>
<a id='line_5654'>  My mother greater, my descent the same."</a>
<a id='line_5655'>  So pray'd the Trojan prince, and, while he pray'd,</a>
<a id='line_5656'>  His hand upon the holy altar laid.</a>
<a id='line_5657'></a>
<a id='line_5658'>  Then thus replied the prophetess divine:</a>
<a id='line_5659'>  "O goddess-born of great Anchises' line,</a>
<a id='line_5660'>  The gates of hell are open night and day;</a>
<a id='line_5661'>  Smooth the descent, and easy is the way:</a>
<a id='line_5662'>  But to return, and view the cheerful skies,</a>
<a id='line_5663'>  In this the task and mighty labor lies.</a>
<a id='line_5664'>  To few great Jupiter imparts this grace,</a>
<a id='line_5665'>  And those of shining worth and heav'nly race.</a>
<a id='line_5666'>  Betwixt those regions and our upper light,</a>
<a id='line_5667'>  Deep forests and impenetrable night</a>
<a id='line_5668'>  Possess the middle space: th' infernal bounds</a>
<a id='line_5669'>  Cocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds.</a>
<a id='line_5670'>  But if so dire a love your soul invades,</a>
<a id='line_5671'>  As twice below to view the trembling shades;</a>
<a id='line_5672'>  If you so hard a toil will undertake,</a>
<a id='line_5673'>  As twice to pass th' innavigable lake;</a>
<a id='line_5674'>  Receive my counsel. In the neighb'ring grove</a>
<a id='line_5675'>  There stands a tree; the queen of Stygian Jove</a>
<a id='line_5676'>  Claims it her own; thick woods and gloomy night</a>
<a id='line_5677'>  Conceal the happy plant from human sight.</a>
<a id='line_5678'>  One bough it bears; but (wondrous to behold!)</a>
<a id='line_5679'>  The ductile rind and leaves of radiant gold:</a>
<a id='line_5680'>  This from the vulgar branches must be torn,</a>
<a id='line_5681'>  And to fair Proserpine the present borne,</a>
<a id='line_5682'>  Ere leave be giv'n to tempt the nether skies.</a>
<a id='line_5683'>  The first thus rent a second will arise,</a>
<a id='line_5684'>  And the same metal the same room supplies.</a>
<a id='line_5685'>  Look round the wood, with lifted eyes, to see</a>
<a id='line_5686'>  The lurking gold upon the fatal tree:</a>
<a id='line_5687'>  Then rend it off, as holy rites command;</a>
<a id='line_5688'>  The willing metal will obey thy hand,</a>
<a id='line_5689'>  Following with ease, if favor'd by thy fate,</a>
<a id='line_5690'>  Thou art foredoom'd to view the Stygian state:</a>
<a id='line_5691'>  If not, no labor can the tree constrain;</a>
<a id='line_5692'>  And strength of stubborn arms and steel are vain.</a>
<a id='line_5693'>  Besides, you know not, while you here attend,</a>
<a id='line_5694'>  Th' unworthy fate of your unhappy friend:</a>
<a id='line_5695'>  Breathless he lies; and his unburied ghost,</a>
<a id='line_5696'>  Depriv'd of fun'ral rites, pollutes your host.</a>
<a id='line_5697'>  Pay first his pious dues; and, for the dead,</a>
<a id='line_5698'>  Two sable sheep around his hearse be led;</a>
<a id='line_5699'>  Then, living turfs upon his body lay:</a>
<a id='line_5700'>  This done, securely take the destin'd way,</a>
<a id='line_5701'>  To find the regions destitute of day."</a>
<a id='line_5702'></a>
<a id='line_5703'>  She said, and held her peace. Aeneas went</a>
<a id='line_5704'>  Sad from the cave, and full of discontent,</a>
<a id='line_5705'>  Unknowing whom the sacred Sibyl meant.</a>
<a id='line_5706'>  Achates, the companion of his breast,</a>
<a id='line_5707'>  Goes grieving by his side, with equal cares oppress'd.</a>
<a id='line_5708'>  Walking, they talk'd, and fruitlessly divin'd</a>
<a id='line_5709'>  What friend the priestess by those words design'd.</a>
<a id='line_5710'>  But soon they found an object to deplore:</a>
<a id='line_5711'>  Misenus lay extended on the shore;</a>
<a id='line_5712'>  Son of the God of Winds: none so renown'd</a>
<a id='line_5713'>  The warrior trumpet in the field to sound;</a>
<a id='line_5714'>  With breathing brass to kindle fierce alarms,</a>
<a id='line_5715'>  And rouse to dare their fate in honorable arms.</a>
<a id='line_5716'>  He serv'd great Hector, and was ever near,</a>
<a id='line_5717'>  Not with his trumpet only, but his spear.</a>
<a id='line_5718'>  But by Pelides' arms when Hector fell,</a>
<a id='line_5719'>  He chose Aeneas; and he chose as well.</a>
<a id='line_5720'>  Swoln with applause, and aiming still at more,</a>
<a id='line_5721'>  He now provokes the sea gods from the shore;</a>
<a id='line_5722'>  With envy Triton heard the martial sound,</a>
<a id='line_5723'>  And the bold champion, for his challenge, drown'd;</a>
<a id='line_5724'>  Then cast his mangled carcass on the strand:</a>
<a id='line_5725'>  The gazing crowd around the body stand.</a>
<a id='line_5726'>  All weep; but most Aeneas mourns his fate,</a>
<a id='line_5727'>  And hastens to perform the funeral state.</a>
<a id='line_5728'>  In altar-wise, a stately pile they rear;</a>
<a id='line_5729'>  The basis broad below, and top advanc'd in air.</a>
<a id='line_5730'>  An ancient wood, fit for the work design'd,</a>
<a id='line_5731'>  (The shady covert of the salvage kind,)</a>
<a id='line_5732'>  The Trojans found: the sounding ax is plied;</a>
<a id='line_5733'>  Firs, pines, and pitch trees, and the tow'ring pride</a>
<a id='line_5734'>  Of forest ashes, feel the fatal stroke,</a>
<a id='line_5735'>  And piercing wedges cleave the stubborn oak.</a>
<a id='line_5736'>  Huge trunks of trees, fell'd from the steepy crown</a>
<a id='line_5737'>  Of the bare mountains, roll with ruin down.</a>
<a id='line_5738'>  Arm'd like the rest the Trojan prince appears,</a>
<a id='line_5739'>  And by his pious labor urges theirs.</a>
<a id='line_5740'></a>
<a id='line_5741'>  Thus while he wrought, revolving in his mind</a>
<a id='line_5742'>  The ways to compass what his wish design'd,</a>
<a id='line_5743'>  He cast his eyes upon the gloomy grove,</a>
<a id='line_5744'>  And then with vows implor'd the Queen of Love:</a>
<a id='line_5745'>  "O may thy pow'r, propitious still to me,</a>
<a id='line_5746'>  Conduct my steps to find the fatal tree,</a>
<a id='line_5747'>  In this deep forest; since the Sibyl's breath</a>
<a id='line_5748'>  Foretold, alas! too true, Misenus' death."</a>
<a id='line_5749'>  Scarce had he said, when, full before his sight,</a>
<a id='line_5750'>  Two doves, descending from their airy flight,</a>
<a id='line_5751'>  Secure upon the grassy plain alight.</a>
<a id='line_5752'>  He knew his mother's birds; and thus he pray'd:</a>
<a id='line_5753'>  "Be you my guides, with your auspicious aid,</a>
<a id='line_5754'>  And lead my footsteps, till the branch be found,</a>
<a id='line_5755'>  Whose glitt'ring shadow gilds the sacred ground.</a>
<a id='line_5756'>  And thou, great parent, with celestial care,</a>
<a id='line_5757'>  In this distress be present to my pray'r!"</a>
<a id='line_5758'>  Thus having said, he stopp'd with watchful sight,</a>
<a id='line_5759'>  Observing still the motions of their flight,</a>
<a id='line_5760'>  What course they took, what happy signs they shew.</a>
<a id='line_5761'>  They fed, and, flutt'ring, by degrees withdrew</a>
<a id='line_5762'>  Still farther from the place, but still in view:</a>
<a id='line_5763'>  Hopping and flying, thus they led him on</a>
<a id='line_5764'>  To the slow lake, whose baleful stench to shun</a>
<a id='line_5765'>  They wing'd their flight aloft; then, stooping low,</a>
<a id='line_5766'>  Perch'd on the double tree that bears the golden bough.</a>
<a id='line_5767'>  Thro' the green leafs the glitt'ring shadows glow;</a>
<a id='line_5768'>  As, on the sacred oak, the wintry mistletoe,</a>
<a id='line_5769'>  Where the proud mother views her precious brood,</a>
<a id='line_5770'>  And happier branches, which she never sow'd.</a>
<a id='line_5771'>  Such was the glitt'ring; such the ruddy rind,</a>
<a id='line_5772'>  And dancing leaves, that wanton'd in the wind.</a>
<a id='line_5773'>  He seiz'd the shining bough with griping hold,</a>
<a id='line_5774'>  And rent away, with ease, the ling'ring gold;</a>
<a id='line_5775'>  Then to the Sibyl's palace bore the prize.</a>
<a id='line_5776'>  Meantime the Trojan troops, with weeping eyes,</a>
<a id='line_5777'>  To dead Misenus pay his obsequies.</a>
<a id='line_5778'>  First, from the ground a lofty pile they rear,</a>
<a id='line_5779'>  Of pitch trees, oaks, and pines, and unctuous fir:</a>
<a id='line_5780'>  The fabric's front with cypress twigs they strew,</a>
<a id='line_5781'>  And stick the sides with boughs of baleful yew.</a>
<a id='line_5782'>  The topmost part his glitt'ring arms adorn;</a>
<a id='line_5783'>  Warm waters, then, in brazen caldrons borne,</a>
<a id='line_5784'>  Are pour'd to wash his body, joint by joint,</a>
<a id='line_5785'>  And fragrant oils the stiffen'd limbs anoint.</a>
<a id='line_5786'>  With groans and cries Misenus they deplore:</a>
<a id='line_5787'>  Then on a bier, with purple cover'd o'er,</a>
<a id='line_5788'>  The breathless body, thus bewail'd, they lay,</a>
<a id='line_5789'>  And fire the pile, their faces turn'd away-</a>
<a id='line_5790'>  Such reverend rites their fathers us'd to pay.</a>
<a id='line_5791'>  Pure oil and incense on the fire they throw,</a>
<a id='line_5792'>  And fat of victims, which his friends bestow.</a>
<a id='line_5793'>  These gifts the greedy flames to dust devour;</a>
<a id='line_5794'>  Then on the living coals red wine they pour;</a>
<a id='line_5795'>  And, last, the relics by themselves dispose,</a>
<a id='line_5796'>  Which in a brazen urn the priests inclose.</a>
<a id='line_5797'>  Old Corynaeus compass'd thrice the crew,</a>
<a id='line_5798'>  And dipp'd an olive branch in holy dew;</a>
<a id='line_5799'>  Which thrice he sprinkled round, and thrice aloud</a>
<a id='line_5800'>  Invok'd the dead, and then dismissed the crowd.</a>
<a id='line_5801'>  But good Aeneas order'd on the shore</a>
<a id='line_5802'>  A stately tomb, whose top a trumpet bore,</a>
<a id='line_5803'>  A soldier's fauchion, and a seaman's oar.</a>
<a id='line_5804'>  Thus was his friend interr'd; and deathless fame</a>
<a id='line_5805'>  Still to the lofty cape consigns his name.</a>
<a id='line_5806'>  These rites perform'd, the prince, without delay,</a>
<a id='line_5807'>  Hastes to the nether world his destin'd way.</a>
<a id='line_5808'>  Deep was the cave; and, downward as it went</a>
<a id='line_5809'>  From the wide mouth, a rocky rough descent;</a>
<a id='line_5810'>  And here th' access a gloomy grove defends,</a>
<a id='line_5811'>  And there th' unnavigable lake extends,</a>
<a id='line_5812'>  O'er whose unhappy waters, void of light,</a>
<a id='line_5813'>  No bird presumes to steer his airy flight;</a>
<a id='line_5814'>  Such deadly stenches from the depths arise,</a>
<a id='line_5815'>  And steaming sulphur, that infects the skies.</a>
<a id='line_5816'>  From hence the Grecian bards their legends make,</a>
<a id='line_5817'>  And give the name Avernus to the lake.</a>
<a id='line_5818'>  Four sable bullocks, in the yoke untaught,</a>
<a id='line_5819'>  For sacrifice the pious hero brought.</a>
<a id='line_5820'>  The priestess pours the wine betwixt their horns;</a>
<a id='line_5821'>  Then cuts the curling hair; that first oblation burns,</a>
<a id='line_5822'>  Invoking Hecate hither to repair:</a>
<a id='line_5823'>  A pow'rful name in hell and upper air.</a>
<a id='line_5824'>  The sacred priests with ready knives bereave</a>
<a id='line_5825'>  The beasts of life, and in full bowls receive</a>
<a id='line_5826'>  The streaming blood: a lamb to Hell and Night</a>
<a id='line_5827'>  (The sable wool without a streak of white)</a>
<a id='line_5828'>  Aeneas offers; and, by fate's decree,</a>
<a id='line_5829'>  A barren heifer, Proserpine, to thee,</a>
<a id='line_5830'>  With holocausts he Pluto's altar fills;</a>
<a id='line_5831'>  Sev'n brawny bulls with his own hand he kills;</a>
<a id='line_5832'>  Then on the broiling entrails oil he pours;</a>
<a id='line_5833'>  Which, ointed thus, the raging flame devours.</a>
<a id='line_5834'>  Late the nocturnal sacrifice begun,</a>
<a id='line_5835'>  Nor ended till the next returning sun.</a>
<a id='line_5836'>  Then earth began to bellow, trees to dance,</a>
<a id='line_5837'>  And howling dogs in glimm'ring light advance,</a>
<a id='line_5838'>  Ere Hecate came. "Far hence be souls profane!"</a>
<a id='line_5839'>  The Sibyl cried, "and from the grove abstain!</a>
<a id='line_5840'>  Now, Trojan, take the way thy fates afford;</a>
<a id='line_5841'>  Assume thy courage, and unsheathe thy sword."</a>
<a id='line_5842'>  She said, and pass'd along the gloomy space;</a>
<a id='line_5843'>  The prince pursued her steps with equal pace.</a>
<a id='line_5844'></a>
<a id='line_5845'>  Ye realms, yet unreveal'd to human sight,</a>
<a id='line_5846'>  Ye gods who rule the regions of the night,</a>
<a id='line_5847'>  Ye gliding ghosts, permit me to relate</a>
<a id='line_5848'>  The mystic wonders of your silent state!</a>
<a id='line_5849'></a>
<a id='line_5850'>  Obscure they went thro' dreary shades, that led</a>
<a id='line_5851'>  Along the waste dominions of the dead.</a>
<a id='line_5852'>  Thus wander travelers in woods by night,</a>
<a id='line_5853'>  By the moon's doubtful and malignant light,</a>
<a id='line_5854'>  When Jove in dusky clouds involves the skies,</a>
<a id='line_5855'>  And the faint crescent shoots by fits before their eyes.</a>
<a id='line_5856'></a>
<a id='line_5857'>  Just in the gate and in the jaws of hell,</a>
<a id='line_5858'>  Revengeful Cares and sullen Sorrows dwell,</a>
<a id='line_5859'>  And pale Diseases, and repining Age,</a>
<a id='line_5860'>  Want, Fear, and Famine's unresisted rage;</a>
<a id='line_5861'>  Here Toils, and Death, and Death's half-brother, Sleep,</a>
<a id='line_5862'>  Forms terrible to view, their sentry keep;</a>
<a id='line_5863'>  With anxious Pleasures of a guilty mind,</a>
<a id='line_5864'>  Deep Frauds before, and open Force behind;</a>
<a id='line_5865'>  The Furies' iron beds; and Strife, that shakes</a>
<a id='line_5866'>  Her hissing tresses and unfolds her snakes.</a>
<a id='line_5867'>  Full in the midst of this infernal road,</a>
<a id='line_5868'>  An elm displays her dusky arms abroad:</a>
<a id='line_5869'>  The God of Sleep there hides his heavy head,</a>
<a id='line_5870'>  And empty dreams on ev'ry leaf are spread.</a>
<a id='line_5871'>  Of various forms unnumber'd specters more,</a>
<a id='line_5872'>  Centaurs, and double shapes, besiege the door.</a>
<a id='line_5873'>  Before the passage, horrid Hydra stands,</a>
<a id='line_5874'>  And Briareus with all his hundred hands;</a>
<a id='line_5875'>  Gorgons, Geryon with his triple frame;</a>
<a id='line_5876'>  And vain Chimaera vomits empty flame.</a>
<a id='line_5877'>  The chief unsheath'd his shining steel, prepar'd,</a>
<a id='line_5878'>  Tho' seiz'd with sudden fear, to force the guard,</a>
<a id='line_5879'>  Off'ring his brandish'd weapon at their face;</a>
<a id='line_5880'>  Had not the Sibyl stopp'd his eager pace,</a>
<a id='line_5881'>  And told him what those empty phantoms were:</a>
<a id='line_5882'>  Forms without bodies, and impassive air.</a>
<a id='line_5883'>  Hence to deep Acheron they take their way,</a>
<a id='line_5884'>  Whose troubled eddies, thick with ooze and clay,</a>
<a id='line_5885'>  Are whirl'd aloft, and in Cocytus lost.</a>
<a id='line_5886'>  There Charon stands, who rules the dreary coast-</a>
<a id='line_5887'>  A sordid god: down from his hoary chin</a>
<a id='line_5888'>  A length of beard descends, uncomb'd, unclean;</a>
<a id='line_5889'>  His eyes, like hollow furnaces on fire;</a>
<a id='line_5890'>  A girdle, foul with grease, binds his obscene attire.</a>
<a id='line_5891'>  He spreads his canvas; with his pole he steers;</a>
<a id='line_5892'>  The freights of flitting ghosts in his thin bottom bears.</a>
<a id='line_5893'>  He look'd in years; yet in his years were seen</a>
<a id='line_5894'>  A youthful vigor and autumnal green.</a>
<a id='line_5895'>  An airy crowd came rushing where he stood,</a>
<a id='line_5896'>  Which fill'd the margin of the fatal flood:</a>
<a id='line_5897'>  Husbands and wives, boys and unmarried maids,</a>
<a id='line_5898'>  And mighty heroes' more majestic shades,</a>
<a id='line_5899'>  And youths, intomb'd before their fathers' eyes,</a>
<a id='line_5900'>  With hollow groans, and shrieks, and feeble cries.</a>
<a id='line_5901'>  Thick as the leaves in autumn strow the woods,</a>
<a id='line_5902'>  Or fowls, by winter forc'd, forsake the floods,</a>
<a id='line_5903'>  And wing their hasty flight to happier lands;</a>
<a id='line_5904'>  Such, and so thick, the shiv'ring army stands,</a>
<a id='line_5905'>  And press for passage with extended hands.</a>
<a id='line_5906'>  Now these, now those, the surly boatman bore:</a>
<a id='line_5907'>  The rest he drove to distance from the shore.</a>
<a id='line_5908'>  The hero, who beheld with wond'ring eyes</a>
<a id='line_5909'>  The tumult mix'd with shrieks, laments, and cries,</a>
<a id='line_5910'>  Ask'd of his guide, what the rude concourse meant;</a>
<a id='line_5911'>  Why to the shore the thronging people bent;</a>
<a id='line_5912'>  What forms of law among the ghosts were us'd;</a>
<a id='line_5913'>  Why some were ferried o'er, and some refus'd.</a>
<a id='line_5914'></a>
<a id='line_5915'>  "Son of Anchises, offspring of the gods,"</a>
<a id='line_5916'>  The Sibyl said, "you see the Stygian floods,</a>
<a id='line_5917'>  The sacred stream which heav'n's imperial state</a>
<a id='line_5918'>  Attests in oaths, and fears to violate.</a>
<a id='line_5919'>  The ghosts rejected are th' unhappy crew</a>
<a id='line_5920'>  Depriv'd of sepulchers and fun'ral due:</a>
<a id='line_5921'>  The boatman, Charon; those, the buried host,</a>
<a id='line_5922'>  He ferries over to the farther coast;</a>
<a id='line_5923'>  Nor dares his transport vessel cross the waves</a>
<a id='line_5924'>  With such whose bones are not compos'd in graves.</a>
<a id='line_5925'>  A hundred years they wander on the shore;</a>
<a id='line_5926'>  At length, their penance done, are wafted o'er."</a>
<a id='line_5927'>  The Trojan chief his forward pace repress'd,</a>
<a id='line_5928'>  Revolving anxious thoughts within his breast,</a>
<a id='line_5929'>  He saw his friends, who, whelm'd beneath the waves,</a>
<a id='line_5930'>  Their fun'ral honors claim'd, and ask'd their quiet graves.</a>
<a id='line_5931'>  The lost Leucaspis in the crowd he knew,</a>
<a id='line_5932'>  And the brave leader of the Lycian crew,</a>
<a id='line_5933'>  Whom, on the Tyrrhene seas, the tempests met;</a>
<a id='line_5934'>  The sailors master'd, and the ship o'erset.</a>
<a id='line_5935'></a>
<a id='line_5936'>  Amidst the spirits, Palinurus press'd,</a>
<a id='line_5937'>  Yet fresh from life, a new-admitted guest,</a>
<a id='line_5938'>  Who, while he steering view'd the stars, and bore</a>
<a id='line_5939'>  His course from Afric to the Latian shore,</a>
<a id='line_5940'>  Fell headlong down. The Trojan fix'd his view,</a>
<a id='line_5941'>  And scarcely thro' the gloom the sullen shadow knew.</a>
<a id='line_5942'>  Then thus the prince: "What envious pow'r, O friend,</a>
<a id='line_5943'>  Brought your lov'd life to this disastrous end?</a>
<a id='line_5944'>  For Phoebus, ever true in all he said,</a>
<a id='line_5945'>  Has in your fate alone my faith betray'd.</a>
<a id='line_5946'>  The god foretold you should not die, before</a>
<a id='line_5947'>  You reach'd, secure from seas, th' Italian shore.</a>
<a id='line_5948'>  Is this th' unerring pow'r?" The ghost replied;</a>
<a id='line_5949'>  "Nor Phoebus flatter'd, nor his answers lied;</a>
<a id='line_5950'>  Nor envious gods have sent me to the deep:</a>
<a id='line_5951'>  But, while the stars and course of heav'n I keep,</a>
<a id='line_5952'>  My wearied eyes were seiz'd with fatal sleep.</a>
<a id='line_5953'>  I fell; and, with my weight, the helm constrain'd</a>
<a id='line_5954'>  Was drawn along, which yet my gripe retain'd.</a>
<a id='line_5955'>  Now by the winds and raging waves I swear,</a>
<a id='line_5956'>  Your safety, more than mine, was then my care;</a>
<a id='line_5957'>  Lest, of the guide bereft, the rudder lost,</a>
<a id='line_5958'>  Your ship should run against the rocky coast.</a>
<a id='line_5959'>  Three blust'ring nights, borne by the southern blast,</a>
<a id='line_5960'>  I floated, and discover'd land at last:</a>
<a id='line_5961'>  High on a mounting wave my head I bore,</a>
<a id='line_5962'>  Forcing my strength, and gath'ring to the shore.</a>
<a id='line_5963'>  Panting, but past the danger, now I seiz'd</a>
<a id='line_5964'>  The craggy cliffs, and my tir'd members eas'd.</a>
<a id='line_5965'>  While, cumber'd with my dropping clothes, I lay,</a>
<a id='line_5966'>  The cruel nation, covetous of prey,</a>
<a id='line_5967'>  Stain'd with my blood th' unhospitable coast;</a>
<a id='line_5968'>  And now, by winds and waves, my lifeless limbs are toss'd:</a>
<a id='line_5969'>  Which O avert, by yon ethereal light,</a>
<a id='line_5970'>  Which I have lost for this eternal night!</a>
<a id='line_5971'>  Or, if by dearer ties you may be won,</a>
<a id='line_5972'>  By your dead sire, and by your living son,</a>
<a id='line_5973'>  Redeem from this reproach my wand'ring ghost;</a>
<a id='line_5974'>  Or with your navy seek the Velin coast,</a>
<a id='line_5975'>  And in a peaceful grave my corpse compose;</a>
<a id='line_5976'>  Or, if a nearer way your mother shows,</a>
<a id='line_5977'>  Without whose aid you durst not undertake</a>
<a id='line_5978'>  This frightful passage o'er the Stygian lake,</a>
<a id='line_5979'>  Lend to this wretch your hand, and waft him o'er</a>
<a id='line_5980'>  To the sweet banks of yon forbidden shore."</a>
<a id='line_5981'>  Scarce had he said, the prophetess began:</a>
<a id='line_5982'>  "What hopes delude thee, miserable man?</a>
<a id='line_5983'>  Think'st thou, thus unintomb'd, to cross the floods,</a>
<a id='line_5984'>  To view the Furies and infernal gods,</a>
<a id='line_5985'>  And visit, without leave, the dark abodes?</a>
<a id='line_5986'>  Attend the term of long revolving years;</a>
<a id='line_5987'>  Fate, and the dooming gods, are deaf to tears.</a>
<a id='line_5988'>  This comfort of thy dire misfortune take:</a>
<a id='line_5989'>  The wrath of Heav'n, inflicted for thy sake,</a>
<a id='line_5990'>  With vengeance shall pursue th' inhuman coast,</a>
<a id='line_5991'>  Till they propitiate thy offended ghost,</a>
<a id='line_5992'>  And raise a tomb, with vows and solemn pray'r;</a>
<a id='line_5993'>  And Palinurus' name the place shall bear."</a>
<a id='line_5994'>  This calm'd his cares; sooth'd with his future fame,</a>
<a id='line_5995'>  And pleas'd to hear his propagated name.</a>
<a id='line_5996'></a>
<a id='line_5997'>  Now nearer to the Stygian lake they draw:</a>
<a id='line_5998'>  Whom, from the shore, the surly boatman saw;</a>
<a id='line_5999'>  Observ'd their passage thro' the shady wood,</a>
<a id='line_6000'>  And mark'd their near approaches to the flood.</a>
<a id='line_6001'>  Then thus he call'd aloud, inflam'd with wrath:</a>
<a id='line_6002'>  "Mortal, whate'er, who this forbidden path</a>
<a id='line_6003'>  In arms presum'st to tread, I charge thee, stand,</a>
<a id='line_6004'>  And tell thy name, and bus'ness in the land.</a>
<a id='line_6005'>  Know this, the realm of night- the Stygian shore:</a>
<a id='line_6006'>  My boat conveys no living bodies o'er;</a>
<a id='line_6007'>  Nor was I pleas'd great Theseus once to bear,</a>
<a id='line_6008'>  Who forc'd a passage with his pointed spear,</a>
<a id='line_6009'>  Nor strong Alcides- men of mighty fame,</a>
<a id='line_6010'>  And from th' immortal gods their lineage came.</a>
<a id='line_6011'>  In fetters one the barking porter tied,</a>
<a id='line_6012'>  And took him trembling from his sov'reign's side:</a>
<a id='line_6013'>  Two sought by force to seize his beauteous bride."</a>
<a id='line_6014'>  To whom the Sibyl thus: "Compose thy mind;</a>
<a id='line_6015'>  Nor frauds are here contriv'd, nor force design'd.</a>
<a id='line_6016'>  Still may the dog the wand'ring troops constrain</a>
<a id='line_6017'>  Of airy ghosts, and vex the guilty train,</a>
<a id='line_6018'>  And with her grisly lord his lovely queen remain.</a>
<a id='line_6019'>  The Trojan chief, whose lineage is from Jove,</a>
<a id='line_6020'>  Much fam'd for arms, and more for filial love,</a>
<a id='line_6021'>  Is sent to seek his sire in your Elysian grove.</a>
<a id='line_6022'>  If neither piety, nor Heav'n's command,</a>
<a id='line_6023'>  Can gain his passage to the Stygian strand,</a>
<a id='line_6024'>  This fatal present shall prevail at least."</a>
<a id='line_6025'>  Then shew'd the shining bough, conceal'd within her vest.</a>
<a id='line_6026'>  No more was needful: for the gloomy god</a>
<a id='line_6027'>  Stood mute with awe, to see the golden rod;</a>
<a id='line_6028'>  Admir'd the destin'd off'ring to his queen-</a>
<a id='line_6029'>  A venerable gift, so rarely seen.</a>
<a id='line_6030'>  His fury thus appeas'd, he puts to land;</a>
<a id='line_6031'>  The ghosts forsake their seats at his command:</a>
<a id='line_6032'>  He clears the deck, receives the mighty freight;</a>
<a id='line_6033'>  The leaky vessel groans beneath the weight.</a>
<a id='line_6034'>  Slowly she sails, and scarcely stems the tides;</a>
<a id='line_6035'>  The pressing water pours within her sides.</a>
<a id='line_6036'>  His passengers at length are wafted o'er,</a>
<a id='line_6037'>  Expos'd, in muddy weeds, upon the miry shore.</a>
<a id='line_6038'></a>
<a id='line_6039'>  No sooner landed, in his den they found</a>
<a id='line_6040'>  The triple porter of the Stygian sound,</a>
<a id='line_6041'>  Grim Cerberus, who soon began to rear</a>
<a id='line_6042'>  His crested snakes, and arm'd his bristling hair.</a>
<a id='line_6043'>  The prudent Sibyl had before prepar'd</a>
<a id='line_6044'>  A sop, in honey steep'd, to charm the guard;</a>
<a id='line_6045'>  Which, mix'd with pow'rful drugs, she cast before</a>
<a id='line_6046'>  His greedy grinning jaws, just op'd to roar.</a>
<a id='line_6047'>  With three enormous mouths he gapes; and straight,</a>
<a id='line_6048'>  With hunger press'd, devours the pleasing bait.</a>
<a id='line_6049'>  Long draughts of sleep his monstrous limbs enslave;</a>
<a id='line_6050'>  He reels, and, falling, fills the spacious cave.</a>
<a id='line_6051'>  The keeper charm'd, the chief without delay</a>
<a id='line_6052'>  Pass'd on, and took th' irremeable way.</a>
<a id='line_6053'>  Before the gates, the cries of babes new born,</a>
<a id='line_6054'>  Whom fate had from their tender mothers torn,</a>
<a id='line_6055'>  Assault his ears: then those, whom form of laws</a>
<a id='line_6056'>  Condemn'd to die, when traitors judg'd their cause.</a>
<a id='line_6057'>  Nor want they lots, nor judges to review</a>
<a id='line_6058'>  The wrongful sentence, and award a new.</a>
<a id='line_6059'>  Minos, the strict inquisitor, appears;</a>
<a id='line_6060'>  And lives and crimes, with his assessors, hears.</a>
<a id='line_6061'>  Round in his urn the blended balls he rolls,</a>
<a id='line_6062'>  Absolves the just, and dooms the guilty souls.</a>
<a id='line_6063'>  The next, in place and punishment, are they</a>
<a id='line_6064'>  Who prodigally throw their souls away;</a>
<a id='line_6065'>  Fools, who, repining at their wretched state,</a>
<a id='line_6066'>  And loathing anxious life, suborn'd their fate.</a>
<a id='line_6067'>  With late repentance now they would retrieve</a>
<a id='line_6068'>  The bodies they forsook, and wish to live;</a>
<a id='line_6069'>  Their pains and poverty desire to bear,</a>
<a id='line_6070'>  To view the light of heav'n, and breathe the vital air:</a>
<a id='line_6071'>  But fate forbids; the Stygian floods oppose,</a>
<a id='line_6072'>  And with circling streams the captive souls inclose.</a>
<a id='line_6073'></a>
<a id='line_6074'>  Not far from thence, the Mournful Fields appear</a>
<a id='line_6075'>  So call'd from lovers that inhabit there.</a>
<a id='line_6076'>  The souls whom that unhappy flame invades,</a>
<a id='line_6077'>  In secret solitude and myrtle shades</a>
<a id='line_6078'>  Make endless moans, and, pining with desire,</a>
<a id='line_6079'>  Lament too late their unextinguish'd fire.</a>
<a id='line_6080'>  Here Procris, Eriphyle here he found,</a>
<a id='line_6081'>  Baring her breast, yet bleeding with the wound</a>
<a id='line_6082'>  Made by her son. He saw Pasiphae there,</a>
<a id='line_6083'>  With Phaedra's ghost, a foul incestuous pair.</a>
<a id='line_6084'>  There Laodamia, with Evadne, moves,</a>
<a id='line_6085'>  Unhappy both, but loyal in their loves:</a>
<a id='line_6086'>  Caeneus, a woman once, and once a man,</a>
<a id='line_6087'>  But ending in the sex she first began.</a>
<a id='line_6088'>  Not far from these Phoenician Dido stood,</a>
<a id='line_6089'>  Fresh from her wound, her bosom bath'd in blood;</a>
<a id='line_6090'>  Whom when the Trojan hero hardly knew,</a>
<a id='line_6091'>  Obscure in shades, and with a doubtful view,</a>
<a id='line_6092'>  (Doubtful as he who sees, thro' dusky night,</a>
<a id='line_6093'>  Or thinks he sees, the moon's uncertain light,)</a>
<a id='line_6094'>  With tears he first approach'd the sullen shade;</a>
<a id='line_6095'>  And, as his love inspir'd him, thus he said:</a>
<a id='line_6096'>  "Unhappy queen! then is the common breath</a>
<a id='line_6097'>  Of rumor true, in your reported death,</a>
<a id='line_6098'>  And I, alas! the cause? By Heav'n, I vow,</a>
<a id='line_6099'>  And all the pow'rs that rule the realms below,</a>
<a id='line_6100'>  Unwilling I forsook your friendly state,</a>
<a id='line_6101'>  Commanded by the gods, and forc'd by fate-</a>
<a id='line_6102'>  Those gods, that fate, whose unresisted might</a>
<a id='line_6103'>  Have sent me to these regions void of light,</a>
<a id='line_6104'>  Thro' the vast empire of eternal night.</a>
<a id='line_6105'>  Nor dar'd I to presume, that, press'd with grief,</a>
<a id='line_6106'>  My flight should urge you to this dire relief.</a>
<a id='line_6107'>  Stay, stay your steps, and listen to my vows:</a>
<a id='line_6108'>  'T is the last interview that fate allows!"</a>
<a id='line_6109'>  In vain he thus attempts her mind to move</a>
<a id='line_6110'>  With tears, and pray'rs, and late-repenting love.</a>
<a id='line_6111'>  Disdainfully she look'd; then turning round,</a>
<a id='line_6112'>  But fix'd her eyes unmov'd upon the ground,</a>
<a id='line_6113'>  And what he says and swears, regards no more</a>
<a id='line_6114'>  Than the deaf rocks, when the loud billows roar;</a>
<a id='line_6115'>  But whirl'd away, to shun his hateful sight,</a>
<a id='line_6116'>  Hid in the forest and the shades of night;</a>
<a id='line_6117'>  Then sought Sichaeus thro' the shady grove,</a>
<a id='line_6118'>  Who answer'd all her cares, and equal'd all her love.</a>
<a id='line_6119'></a>
<a id='line_6120'>  Some pious tears the pitying hero paid,</a>
<a id='line_6121'>  And follow'd with his eyes the flitting shade,</a>
<a id='line_6122'>  Then took the forward way, by fate ordain'd,</a>
<a id='line_6123'>  And, with his guide, the farther fields attain'd,</a>
<a id='line_6124'>  Where, sever'd from the rest, the warrior souls remain'd.</a>
<a id='line_6125'>  Tydeus he met, with Meleager's race,</a>
<a id='line_6126'>  The pride of armies, and the soldiers' grace;</a>
<a id='line_6127'>  And pale Adrastus with his ghastly face.</a>
<a id='line_6128'>  Of Trojan chiefs he view'd a num'rous train,</a>
<a id='line_6129'>  All much lamented, all in battle slain;</a>
<a id='line_6130'>  Glaucus and Medon, high above the rest,</a>
<a id='line_6131'>  Antenor's sons, and Ceres' sacred priest.</a>
<a id='line_6132'>  And proud Idaeus, Priam's charioteer,</a>
<a id='line_6133'>  Who shakes his empty reins, and aims his airy spear.</a>
<a id='line_6134'>  The gladsome ghosts, in circling troops, attend</a>
<a id='line_6135'>  And with unwearied eyes behold their friend;</a>
<a id='line_6136'>  Delight to hover near, and long to know</a>
<a id='line_6137'>  What bus'ness brought him to the realms below.</a>
<a id='line_6138'>  But Argive chiefs, and Agamemnon's train,</a>
<a id='line_6139'>  When his refulgent arms flash'd thro' the shady plain,</a>
<a id='line_6140'>  Fled from his well-known face, with wonted fear,</a>
<a id='line_6141'>  As when his thund'ring sword and pointed spear</a>
<a id='line_6142'>  Drove headlong to their ships, and glean'd the routed rear.</a>
<a id='line_6143'>  They rais'd a feeble cry, with trembling notes;</a>
<a id='line_6144'>  But the weak voice deceiv'd their gasping throats.</a>
<a id='line_6145'></a>
<a id='line_6146'>  Here Priam's son, Deiphobus, he found,</a>
<a id='line_6147'>  Whose face and limbs were one continued wound:</a>
<a id='line_6148'>  Dishonest, with lopp'd arms, the youth appears,</a>
<a id='line_6149'>  Spoil'd of his nose, and shorten'd of his ears.</a>
<a id='line_6150'>  He scarcely knew him, striving to disown</a>
<a id='line_6151'>  His blotted form, and blushing to be known;</a>
<a id='line_6152'>  And therefore first began: "O Teucer's race,</a>
<a id='line_6153'>  Who durst thy faultless figure thus deface?</a>
<a id='line_6154'>  What heart could wish, what hand inflict, this dire disgrace?</a>
<a id='line_6155'>  'Twas fam'd, that in our last and fatal night</a>
<a id='line_6156'>  Your single prowess long sustain'd the fight,</a>
<a id='line_6157'>  Till tir'd, not forc'd, a glorious fate you chose,</a>
<a id='line_6158'>  And fell upon a heap of slaughter'd foes.</a>
<a id='line_6159'>  But, in remembrance of so brave a deed,</a>
<a id='line_6160'>  A tomb and fun'ral honors I decreed;</a>
<a id='line_6161'>  Thrice call'd your manes on the Trojan plains:</a>
<a id='line_6162'>  The place your armor and your name retains.</a>
<a id='line_6163'>  Your body too I sought, and, had I found,</a>
<a id='line_6164'>  Design'd for burial in your native ground."</a>
<a id='line_6165'></a>
<a id='line_6166'>  The ghost replied: "Your piety has paid</a>
<a id='line_6167'>  All needful rites, to rest my wand'ring shade;</a>
<a id='line_6168'>  But cruel fate, and my more cruel wife,</a>
<a id='line_6169'>  To Grecian swords betray'd my sleeping life.</a>
<a id='line_6170'>  These are the monuments of Helen's love:</a>
<a id='line_6171'>  The shame I bear below, the marks I bore above.</a>
<a id='line_6172'>  You know in what deluding joys we pass'd</a>
<a id='line_6173'>  The night that was by Heav'n decreed our last:</a>
<a id='line_6174'>  For, when the fatal horse, descending down,</a>
<a id='line_6175'>  Pregnant with arms, o'erwhelm'd th' unhappy town</a>
<a id='line_6176'>  She feign'd nocturnal orgies; left my bed,</a>
<a id='line_6177'>  And, mix'd with Trojan dames, the dances led</a>
<a id='line_6178'>  Then, waving high her torch, the signal made,</a>
<a id='line_6179'>  Which rous'd the Grecians from their ambuscade.</a>
<a id='line_6180'>  With watching overworn, with cares oppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_6181'>  Unhappy I had laid me down to rest,</a>
<a id='line_6182'>  And heavy sleep my weary limbs possess'd.</a>
<a id='line_6183'>  Meantime my worthy wife our arms mislaid,</a>
<a id='line_6184'>  And from beneath my head my sword convey'd;</a>
<a id='line_6185'>  The door unlatch'd, and, with repeated calls,</a>
<a id='line_6186'>  Invites her former lord within my walls.</a>
<a id='line_6187'>  Thus in her crime her confidence she plac'd,</a>
<a id='line_6188'>  And with new treasons would redeem the past.</a>
<a id='line_6189'>  What need I more? Into the room they ran,</a>
<a id='line_6190'>  And meanly murther'd a defenseless man.</a>
<a id='line_6191'>  Ulysses, basely born, first led the way.</a>
<a id='line_6192'>  Avenging pow'rs! with justice if I pray,</a>
<a id='line_6193'>  That fortune be their own another day!</a>
<a id='line_6194'>  But answer you; and in your turn relate,</a>
<a id='line_6195'>  What brought you, living, to the Stygian state:</a>
<a id='line_6196'>  Driv'n by the winds and errors of the sea,</a>
<a id='line_6197'>  Or did you Heav'n's superior doom obey?</a>
<a id='line_6198'>  Or tell what other chance conducts your way,</a>
<a id='line_6199'>  To view with mortal eyes our dark retreats,</a>
<a id='line_6200'>  Tumults and torments of th' infernal seats."</a>
<a id='line_6201'></a>
<a id='line_6202'>  While thus in talk the flying hours they pass,</a>
<a id='line_6203'>  The sun had finish'd more than half his race:</a>
<a id='line_6204'>  And they, perhaps, in words and tears had spent</a>
<a id='line_6205'>  The little time of stay which Heav'n had lent;</a>
<a id='line_6206'>  But thus the Sibyl chides their long delay:</a>
<a id='line_6207'>  "Night rushes down, and headlong drives the day:</a>
<a id='line_6208'>  'T is here, in different paths, the way divides;</a>
<a id='line_6209'>  The right to Pluto's golden palace guides;</a>
<a id='line_6210'>  The left to that unhappy region tends,</a>
<a id='line_6211'>  Which to the depth of Tartarus descends;</a>
<a id='line_6212'>  The seat of night profound, and punish'd fiends."</a>
<a id='line_6213'>  Then thus Deiphobus: "O sacred maid,</a>
<a id='line_6214'>  Forbear to chide, and be your will obey'd!</a>
<a id='line_6215'>  Lo! to the secret shadows I retire,</a>
<a id='line_6216'>  To pay my penance till my years expire.</a>
<a id='line_6217'>  Proceed, auspicious prince, with glory crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_6218'>  And born to better fates than I have found."</a>
<a id='line_6219'>  He said; and, while he said, his steps he turn'd</a>
<a id='line_6220'>  To secret shadows, and in silence mourn'd.</a>
<a id='line_6221'></a>
<a id='line_6222'>  The hero, looking on the left, espied</a>
<a id='line_6223'>  A lofty tow'r, and strong on ev'ry side</a>
<a id='line_6224'>  With treble walls, which Phlegethon surrounds,</a>
<a id='line_6225'>  Whose fiery flood the burning empire bounds;</a>
<a id='line_6226'>  And, press'd betwixt the rocks, the bellowing noise resounds</a>
<a id='line_6227'>  Wide is the fronting gate, and, rais'd on high</a>
<a id='line_6228'>  With adamantine columns, threats the sky.</a>
<a id='line_6229'>  Vain is the force of man, and Heav'n's as vain,</a>
<a id='line_6230'>  To crush the pillars which the pile sustain.</a>
<a id='line_6231'>  Sublime on these a tow'r of steel is rear'd;</a>
<a id='line_6232'>  And dire Tisiphone there keeps the ward,</a>
<a id='line_6233'>  Girt in her sanguine gown, by night and day,</a>
<a id='line_6234'>  Observant of the souls that pass the downward way.</a>
<a id='line_6235'>  From hence are heard the groans of ghosts, the pains</a>
<a id='line_6236'>  Of sounding lashes and of dragging chains.</a>
<a id='line_6237'>  The Trojan stood astonish'd at their cries,</a>
<a id='line_6238'>  And ask'd his guide from whence those yells arise;</a>
<a id='line_6239'>  And what the crimes, and what the tortures were,</a>
<a id='line_6240'>  And loud laments that rent the liquid air.</a>
<a id='line_6241'></a>
<a id='line_6242'>  She thus replied: "The chaste and holy race</a>
<a id='line_6243'>  Are all forbidden this polluted place.</a>
<a id='line_6244'>  But Hecate, when she gave to rule the woods,</a>
<a id='line_6245'>  Then led me trembling thro' these dire abodes,</a>
<a id='line_6246'>  And taught the tortures of th' avenging gods.</a>
<a id='line_6247'>  These are the realms of unrelenting fate;</a>
<a id='line_6248'>  And awful Rhadamanthus rules the state.</a>
<a id='line_6249'>  He hears and judges each committed crime;</a>
<a id='line_6250'>  Enquires into the manner, place, and time.</a>
<a id='line_6251'>  The conscious wretch must all his acts reveal,</a>
<a id='line_6252'>  (Loth to confess, unable to conceal),</a>
<a id='line_6253'>  From the first moment of his vital breath,</a>
<a id='line_6254'>  To his last hour of unrepenting death.</a>
<a id='line_6255'>  Straight, o'er the guilty ghost, the Fury shakes</a>
<a id='line_6256'>  The sounding whip and brandishes her snakes,</a>
<a id='line_6257'>  And the pale sinner, with her sisters, takes.</a>
<a id='line_6258'>  Then, of itself, unfolds th' eternal door;</a>
<a id='line_6259'>  With dreadful sounds the brazen hinges roar.</a>
<a id='line_6260'>  You see, before the gate, what stalking ghost</a>
<a id='line_6261'>  Commands the guard, what sentries keep the post.</a>
<a id='line_6262'>  More formidable Hydra stands within,</a>
<a id='line_6263'>  Whose jaws with iron teeth severely grin.</a>
<a id='line_6264'>  The gaping gulf low to the center lies,</a>
<a id='line_6265'>  And twice as deep as earth is distant from the skies.</a>
<a id='line_6266'>  The rivals of the gods, the Titan race,</a>
<a id='line_6267'>  Here, sing'd with lightning, roll within th' unfathom'd space.</a>
<a id='line_6268'>  Here lie th' Alaean twins, (I saw them both,)</a>
<a id='line_6269'>  Enormous bodies, of gigantic growth,</a>
<a id='line_6270'>  Who dar'd in fight the Thund'rer to defy,</a>
<a id='line_6271'>  Affect his heav'n, and force him from the sky.</a>
<a id='line_6272'>  Salmoneus, suff'ring cruel pains, I found,</a>
<a id='line_6273'>  For emulating Jove; the rattling sound</a>
<a id='line_6274'>  Of mimic thunder, and the glitt'ring blaze</a>
<a id='line_6275'>  Of pointed lightnings, and their forky rays.</a>
<a id='line_6276'>  Thro' Elis and the Grecian towns he flew;</a>
<a id='line_6277'>  Th' audacious wretch four fiery coursers drew:</a>
<a id='line_6278'>  He wav'd a torch aloft, and, madly vain,</a>
<a id='line_6279'>  Sought godlike worship from a servile train.</a>
<a id='line_6280'>  Ambitious fool! with horny hoofs to pass</a>
<a id='line_6281'>  O'er hollow arches of resounding brass,</a>
<a id='line_6282'>  To rival thunder in its rapid course,</a>
<a id='line_6283'>  And imitate inimitable force!</a>
<a id='line_6284'>  But he, the King of Heav'n, obscure on high,</a>
<a id='line_6285'>  Bar'd his red arm, and, launching from the sky</a>
<a id='line_6286'>  His writhen bolt, not shaking empty smoke,</a>
<a id='line_6287'>  Down to the deep abyss the flaming felon strook.</a>
<a id='line_6288'>  There Tityus was to see, who took his birth</a>
<a id='line_6289'>  From heav'n, his nursing from the foodful earth.</a>
<a id='line_6290'>  Here his gigantic limbs, with large embrace,</a>
<a id='line_6291'>  Infold nine acres of infernal space.</a>
<a id='line_6292'>  A rav'nous vulture, in his open'd side,</a>
<a id='line_6293'>  Her crooked beak and cruel talons tried;</a>
<a id='line_6294'>  Still for the growing liver digg'd his breast;</a>
<a id='line_6295'>  The growing liver still supplied the feast;</a>
<a id='line_6296'>  Still are his entrails fruitful to their pains:</a>
<a id='line_6297'>  Th' immortal hunger lasts, th' immortal food remains.</a>
<a id='line_6298'>  Ixion and Perithous I could name,</a>
<a id='line_6299'>  And more Thessalian chiefs of mighty fame.</a>
<a id='line_6300'>  High o'er their heads a mold'ring rock is plac'd,</a>
<a id='line_6301'>  That promises a fall, and shakes at ev'ry blast.</a>
<a id='line_6302'>  They lie below, on golden beds display'd;</a>
<a id='line_6303'>  And genial feasts with regal pomp are made.</a>
<a id='line_6304'>  The Queen of Furies by their sides is set,</a>
<a id='line_6305'>  And snatches from their mouths th' untasted meat,</a>
<a id='line_6306'>  Which if they touch, her hissing snakes she rears,</a>
<a id='line_6307'>  Tossing her torch, and thund'ring in their ears.</a>
<a id='line_6308'>  Then they, who brothers' better claim disown,</a>
<a id='line_6309'>  Expel their parents, and usurp the throne;</a>
<a id='line_6310'>  Defraud their clients, and, to lucre sold,</a>
<a id='line_6311'>  Sit brooding on unprofitable gold;</a>
<a id='line_6312'>  Who dare not give, and ev'n refuse to lend</a>
<a id='line_6313'>  To their poor kindred, or a wanting friend.</a>
<a id='line_6314'>  Vast is the throng of these; nor less the train</a>
<a id='line_6315'>  Of lustful youths, for foul adult'ry slain:</a>
<a id='line_6316'>  Hosts of deserters, who their honor sold,</a>
<a id='line_6317'>  And basely broke their faith for bribes of gold.</a>
<a id='line_6318'>  All these within the dungeon's depth remain,</a>
<a id='line_6319'>  Despairing pardon, and expecting pain.</a>
<a id='line_6320'>  Ask not what pains; nor farther seek to know</a>
<a id='line_6321'>  Their process, or the forms of law below.</a>
<a id='line_6322'>  Some roll a weighty stone; some, laid along,</a>
<a id='line_6323'>  And bound with burning wires, on spokes of wheels are hung</a>
<a id='line_6324'>  Unhappy Theseus, doom'd for ever there,</a>
<a id='line_6325'>  Is fix'd by fate on his eternal chair;</a>
<a id='line_6326'>  And wretched Phlegyas warns the world with cries</a>
<a id='line_6327'>  (Could warning make the world more just or wise):</a>
<a id='line_6328'>  'Learn righteousness, and dread th' avenging deities.'</a>
<a id='line_6329'>  To tyrants others have their country sold,</a>
<a id='line_6330'>  Imposing foreign lords, for foreign gold;</a>
<a id='line_6331'>  Some have old laws repeal'd, new statutes made,</a>
<a id='line_6332'>  Not as the people pleas'd, but as they paid;</a>
<a id='line_6333'>  With incest some their daughters' bed profan'd:</a>
<a id='line_6334'>  All dar'd the worst of ills, and, what they dar'd, attain'd.</a>
<a id='line_6335'>  Had I a hundred mouths, a hundred tongues,</a>
<a id='line_6336'>  And throats of brass, inspir'd with iron lungs,</a>
<a id='line_6337'>  I could not half those horrid crimes repeat,</a>
<a id='line_6338'>  Nor half the punishments those crimes have met.</a>
<a id='line_6339'>  But let us haste our voyage to pursue:</a>
<a id='line_6340'>  The walls of Pluto's palace are in view;</a>
<a id='line_6341'>  The gate, and iron arch above it, stands</a>
<a id='line_6342'>  On anvils labor'd by the Cyclops' hands.</a>
<a id='line_6343'>  Before our farther way the Fates allow,</a>
<a id='line_6344'>  Here must we fix on high the golden bough."</a>
<a id='line_6345'></a>
<a id='line_6346'>  She said: and thro' the gloomy shades they pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_6347'>  And chose the middle path. Arriv'd at last,</a>
<a id='line_6348'>  The prince with living water sprinkled o'er</a>
<a id='line_6349'>  His limbs and body; then approach'd the door,</a>
<a id='line_6350'>  Possess'd the porch, and on the front above</a>
<a id='line_6351'>  He fix'd the fatal bough requir'd by Pluto's love.</a>
<a id='line_6352'>  These holy rites perform'd, they took their way</a>
<a id='line_6353'>  Where long extended plains of pleasure lay:</a>
<a id='line_6354'>  The verdant fields with those of heav'n may vie,</a>
<a id='line_6355'>  With ether vested, and a purple sky;</a>
<a id='line_6356'>  The blissful seats of happy souls below.</a>
<a id='line_6357'>  Stars of their own, and their own suns, they know;</a>
<a id='line_6358'>  Their airy limbs in sports they exercise,</a>
<a id='line_6359'>  And on the green contend the wrestler's prize.</a>
<a id='line_6360'>  Some in heroic verse divinely sing;</a>
<a id='line_6361'>  Others in artful measures led the ring.</a>
<a id='line_6362'>  The Thracian bard, surrounded by the rest,</a>
<a id='line_6363'>  There stands conspicuous in his flowing vest;</a>
<a id='line_6364'>  His flying fingers, and harmonious quill,</a>
<a id='line_6365'>  Strikes sev'n distinguish'd notes, and sev'n at once they fill.</a>
<a id='line_6366'>  Here found they Teucer's old heroic race,</a>
<a id='line_6367'>  Born better times and happier years to grace.</a>
<a id='line_6368'>  Assaracus and Ilus here enjoy</a>
<a id='line_6369'>  Perpetual fame, with him who founded Troy.</a>
<a id='line_6370'>  The chief beheld their chariots from afar,</a>
<a id='line_6371'>  Their shining arms, and coursers train'd to war:</a>
<a id='line_6372'>  Their lances fix'd in earth, their steeds around,</a>
<a id='line_6373'>  Free from their harness, graze the flow'ry ground.</a>
<a id='line_6374'>  The love of horses which they had, alive,</a>
<a id='line_6375'>  And care of chariots, after death survive.</a>
<a id='line_6376'>  Some cheerful souls were feasting on the plain;</a>
<a id='line_6377'>  Some did the song, and some the choir maintain,</a>
<a id='line_6378'>  Beneath a laurel shade, where mighty Po</a>
<a id='line_6379'>  Mounts up to woods above, and hides his head below.</a>
<a id='line_6380'>  Here patriots live, who, for their country's good,</a>
<a id='line_6381'>  In fighting fields, were prodigal of blood:</a>
<a id='line_6382'>  Priests of unblemish'd lives here make abode,</a>
<a id='line_6383'>  And poets worthy their inspiring god;</a>
<a id='line_6384'>  And searching wits, of more mechanic parts,</a>
<a id='line_6385'>  Who grac'd their age with new-invented arts:</a>
<a id='line_6386'>  Those who to worth their bounty did extend,</a>
<a id='line_6387'>  And those who knew that bounty to commend.</a>
<a id='line_6388'>  The heads of these with holy fillets bound,</a>
<a id='line_6389'>  And all their temples were with garlands crown'd.</a>
<a id='line_6390'></a>
<a id='line_6391'>  To these the Sibyl thus her speech address'd,</a>
<a id='line_6392'>  And first to him surrounded by the rest</a>
<a id='line_6393'>  (Tow'ring his height, and ample was his breast):</a>
<a id='line_6394'>  "Say, happy souls, divine Musaeus, say,</a>
<a id='line_6395'>  Where lives Anchises, and where lies our way</a>
<a id='line_6396'>  To find the hero, for whose only sake</a>
<a id='line_6397'>  We sought the dark abodes, and cross'd the bitter lake?"</a>
<a id='line_6398'>  To this the sacred poet thus replied:</a>
<a id='line_6399'>  "In no fix'd place the happy souls reside.</a>
<a id='line_6400'>  In groves we live, and lie on mossy beds,</a>
<a id='line_6401'>  By crystal streams, that murmur thro' the meads:</a>
<a id='line_6402'>  But pass yon easy hill, and thence descend;</a>
<a id='line_6403'>  The path conducts you to your journey's end."</a>
<a id='line_6404'>  This said, he led them up the mountain's brow,</a>
<a id='line_6405'>  And shews them all the shining fields below.</a>
<a id='line_6406'>  They wind the hill, and thro' the blissful meadows go.</a>
<a id='line_6407'></a>
<a id='line_6408'>  But old Anchises, in a flow'ry vale,</a>
<a id='line_6409'>  Review'd his muster'd race, and took the tale:</a>
<a id='line_6410'>  Those happy spirits, which, ordain'd by fate,</a>
<a id='line_6411'>  For future beings and new bodies wait-</a>
<a id='line_6412'>  With studious thought observ'd th' illustrious throng,</a>
<a id='line_6413'>  In nature's order as they pass'd along:</a>
<a id='line_6414'>  Their names, their fates, their conduct, and their care,</a>
<a id='line_6415'>  In peaceful senates and successful war.</a>
<a id='line_6416'>  He, when Aeneas on the plain appears,</a>
<a id='line_6417'>  Meets him with open arms, and falling tears.</a>
<a id='line_6418'>  "Welcome," he said, "the gods' undoubted race!</a>
<a id='line_6419'>  O long expected to my dear embrace!</a>
<a id='line_6420'>  Once more 't is giv'n me to behold your face!</a>
<a id='line_6421'>  The love and pious duty which you pay</a>
<a id='line_6422'>  Have pass'd the perils of so hard a way.</a>
<a id='line_6423'>  'T is true, computing times, I now believ'd</a>
<a id='line_6424'>  The happy day approach'd; nor are my hopes deceiv'd.</a>
<a id='line_6425'>  What length of lands, what oceans have you pass'd;</a>
<a id='line_6426'>  What storms sustain'd, and on what shores been cast?</a>
<a id='line_6427'>  How have I fear'd your fate! but fear'd it most,</a>
<a id='line_6428'>  When love assail'd you, on the Libyan coast."</a>
<a id='line_6429'>  To this, the filial duty thus replies:</a>
<a id='line_6430'>  "Your sacred ghost before my sleeping eyes</a>
<a id='line_6431'>  Appear'd, and often urg'd this painful enterprise.</a>
<a id='line_6432'>  After long tossing on the Tyrrhene sea,</a>
<a id='line_6433'>  My navy rides at anchor in the bay.</a>
<a id='line_6434'>  But reach your hand, O parent shade, nor shun</a>
<a id='line_6435'>  The dear embraces of your longing son!"</a>
<a id='line_6436'>  He said; and falling tears his face bedew:</a>
<a id='line_6437'>  Then thrice around his neck his arms he threw;</a>
<a id='line_6438'>  And thrice the flitting shadow slipp'd away,</a>
<a id='line_6439'>  Like winds, or empty dreams that fly the day.</a>
<a id='line_6440'></a>
<a id='line_6441'>  Now, in a secret vale, the Trojan sees</a>
<a id='line_6442'>  A sep'rate grove, thro' which a gentle breeze</a>
<a id='line_6443'>  Plays with a passing breath, and whispers thro' the trees;</a>
<a id='line_6444'>  And, just before the confines of the wood,</a>
<a id='line_6445'>  The gliding Lethe leads her silent flood.</a>
<a id='line_6446'>  About the boughs an airy nation flew,</a>
<a id='line_6447'>  Thick as the humming bees, that hunt the golden dew;</a>
<a id='line_6448'>  In summer's heat on tops of lilies feed,</a>

<a id='line_6759'>  Now near the shelves of Circe's shores they run,</a>
<a id='line_6760'>  (Circe the rich, the daughter of the Sun,)</a>
<a id='line_6761'>  A dang'rous coast: the goddess wastes her days</a>
<a id='line_6762'>  In joyous songs; the rocks resound her lays:</a>
<a id='line_6763'>  In spinning, or the loom, she spends the night,</a>
<a id='line_6764'>  And cedar brands supply her father's light.</a>
<a id='line_6765'>  From hence were heard, rebellowing to the main,</a>
<a id='line_6766'>  The roars of lions that refuse the chain,</a>
<a id='line_6767'>  The grunts of bristled boars, and groans of bears,</a>
<a id='line_6768'>  And herds of howling wolves that stun the sailors' ears.</a>
<a id='line_6769'>  These from their caverns, at the close of night,</a>
<a id='line_6770'>  Fill the sad isle with horror and affright.</a>
<a id='line_6771'>  Darkling they mourn their fate, whom Circe's pow'r,</a>
<a id='line_6772'>  (That watch'd the moon and planetary hour,)</a>
<a id='line_6773'>  With words and wicked herbs from humankind</a>
<a id='line_6774'>  Had alter'd, and in brutal shapes confin'd.</a>
<a id='line_6775'>  Which monsters lest the Trojans' pious host</a>
<a id='line_6776'>  Should bear, or touch upon th' inchanted coast,</a>
<a id='line_6777'>  Propitious Neptune steer'd their course by night</a>
<a id='line_6778'>  With rising gales that sped their happy flight.</a>
<a id='line_6779'>  Supplied with these, they skim the sounding shore,</a>
<a id='line_6780'>  And hear the swelling surges vainly roar.</a>
<a id='line_6781'>  Now, when the rosy morn began to rise,</a>
<a id='line_6782'>  And wav'd her saffron streamer thro' the skies;</a>
<a id='line_6783'>  When Thetis blush'd in purple not her own,</a>
<a id='line_6784'>  And from her face the breathing winds were blown,</a>
<a id='line_6785'>  A sudden silence sate upon the sea,</a>
<a id='line_6786'>  And sweeping oars, with struggling, urge their way.</a>
<a id='line_6787'>  The Trojan, from the main, beheld a wood,</a>
<a id='line_6788'>  Which thick with shades and a brown horror stood:</a>
<a id='line_6789'>  Betwixt the trees the Tiber took his course,</a>
<a id='line_6790'>  With whirlpools dimpled; and with downward force,</a>
<a id='line_6791'>  That drove the sand along, he took his way,</a>
<a id='line_6792'>  And roll'd his yellow billows to the sea.</a>
<a id='line_6793'>  About him, and above, and round the wood,</a>
<a id='line_6794'>  The birds that haunt the borders of his flood,</a>
<a id='line_6795'>  That bath'd within, or basked upon his side,</a>
<a id='line_6796'>  To tuneful songs their narrow throats applied.</a>
<a id='line_6797'>  The captain gives command; the joyful train</a>
<a id='line_6798'>  Glide thro' the gloomy shade, and leave the main.</a>
<a id='line_6799'></a>
<a id='line_6800'>  Now, Erato, thy poet's mind inspire,</a>
<a id='line_6801'>  And fill his soul with thy celestial fire!</a>
<a id='line_6802'>  Relate what Latium was; her ancient kings;</a>
<a id='line_6803'>  Declare the past and state of things,</a>
<a id='line_6804'>  When first the Trojan fleet Ausonia sought,</a>
<a id='line_6805'>  And how the rivals lov'd, and how they fought.</a>
<a id='line_6806'>  These are my theme, and how the war began,</a>
<a id='line_6807'>  And how concluded by the godlike man:</a>
<a id='line_6808'>  For I shall sing of battles, blood, and rage,</a>
<a id='line_6809'>  Which princes and their people did engage;</a>
<a id='line_6810'>  And haughty souls, that, mov'd with mutual hate,</a>
<a id='line_6811'>  In fighting fields pursued and found their fate;</a>
<a id='line_6812'>  That rous'd the Tyrrhene realm with loud alarms,</a>
<a id='line_6813'>  And peaceful Italy involv'd in arms.</a>
<a id='line_6814'>  A larger scene of action is display'd;</a>
<a id='line_6815'>  And, rising hence, a greater work is weigh'd.</a>
<a id='line_6816'></a>
<a id='line_6817'>  Latinus, old and mild, had long possess'd</a>
<a id='line_6818'>  The Latin scepter, and his people blest:</a>
<a id='line_6819'>  His father Faunus; a Laurentian dame</a>
<a id='line_6820'>  His mother; fair Marica was her name.</a>
<a id='line_6821'>  But Faunus came from Picus: Picus drew</a>
<a id='line_6822'>  His birth from Saturn, if records be true.</a>
<a id='line_6823'>  Thus King Latinus, in the third degree,</a>
<a id='line_6824'>  Had Saturn author of his family.</a>
<a id='line_6825'>  But this old peaceful prince, as Heav'n decreed,</a>
<a id='line_6826'>  Was blest with no male issue to succeed:</a>
<a id='line_6827'>  His sons in blooming youth were snatch'd by fate;</a>
<a id='line_6828'>  One only daughter heir'd the royal state.</a>
<a id='line_6829'>  Fir'd with her love, and with ambition led,</a>
<a id='line_6830'>  The neighb'ring princes court her nuptial bed.</a>
<a id='line_6831'>  Among the crowd, but far above the rest,</a>
<a id='line_6832'>  Young Turnus to the beauteous maid address'd.</a>
<a id='line_6833'>  Turnus, for high descent and graceful mien,</a>
<a id='line_6834'>  Was first, and favor'd by the Latian queen;</a>
<a id='line_6835'>  With him she strove to join Lavinia's hand,</a>
<a id='line_6836'>  But dire portents the purpos'd match withstand.</a>
<a id='line_6837'></a>
<a id='line_6838'>  Deep in the palace, of long growth, there stood</a>
<a id='line_6839'>  A laurel's trunk, a venerable wood;</a>
<a id='line_6840'>  Where rites divine were paid; whose holy hair</a>
<a id='line_6841'>  Was kept and cut with superstitious care.</a>
<a id='line_6842'>  This plant Latinus, when his town he wall'd,</a>
<a id='line_6843'>  Then found, and from the tree Laurentum call'd;</a>
<a id='line_6844'>  And last, in honor of his new abode,</a>
<a id='line_6845'>  He vow'd the laurel to the laurel's god.</a>
<a id='line_6846'>  It happen'd once (a boding prodigy!)</a>
<a id='line_6847'>  A swarm of bees, that cut the liquid sky,</a>
<a id='line_6848'>  (Unknown from whence they took their airy flight,)</a>
<a id='line_6849'>  Upon the topmost branch in clouds alight;</a>
<a id='line_6850'>  There with their clasping feet together clung,</a>
<a id='line_6851'>  And a long cluster from the laurel hung.</a>
<a id='line_6852'>  An ancient augur prophesied from hence:</a>
<a id='line_6853'>  "Behold on Latian shores a foreign prince!</a>
<a id='line_6854'>  From the same parts of heav'n his navy stands,</a>
<a id='line_6855'>  To the same parts on earth; his army lands;</a>
<a id='line_6856'>  The town he conquers, and the tow'r commands."</a>
<a id='line_6857'></a>
<a id='line_6858'>  Yet more, when fair Lavinia fed the fire</a>
<a id='line_6859'>  Before the gods, and stood beside her sire,</a>
<a id='line_6860'>  (Strange to relate!) the flames, involv'd in smoke</a>
<a id='line_6861'>  Of incense, from the sacred altar broke,</a>
<a id='line_6862'>  Caught her dishevel'd hair and rich attire;</a>
<a id='line_6863'>  Her crown and jewels crackled in the fire:</a>
<a id='line_6864'>  From thence the fuming trail began to spread</a>
<a id='line_6865'>  And lambent glories danc'd about her head.</a>
<a id='line_6866'>  This new portent the seer with wonder views,</a>
<a id='line_6867'>  Then pausing, thus his prophecy renews:</a>
<a id='line_6868'>  "The nymph, who scatters flaming fires around,</a>
<a id='line_6869'>  Shall shine with honor, shall herself be crown'd;</a>
<a id='line_6870'>  But, caus'd by her irrevocable fate,</a>
<a id='line_6871'>  War shall the country waste, and change the state."</a>
<a id='line_6872'></a>
<a id='line_6873'>  Latinus, frighted with this dire ostent,</a>
<a id='line_6874'>  For counsel to his father Faunus went,</a>
<a id='line_6875'>  And sought the shades renown'd for prophecy</a>
<a id='line_6876'>  Which near Albunea's sulph'rous fountain lie.</a>
<a id='line_6877'>  To these the Latian and the Sabine land</a>
<a id='line_6878'>  Fly, when distress'd, and thence relief demand.</a>
<a id='line_6879'>  The priest on skins of off'rings takes his ease,</a>
<a id='line_6880'>  And nightly visions in his slumber sees;</a>
<a id='line_6881'>  A swarm of thin aerial shapes appears,</a>
<a id='line_6882'>  And, flutt'ring round his temples, deafs his ears:</a>
<a id='line_6883'>  These he consults, the future fates to know,</a>
<a id='line_6884'>  From pow'rs above, and from the fiends below.</a>
<a id='line_6885'>  Here, for the gods' advice, Latinus flies,</a>
<a id='line_6886'>  Off'ring a hundred sheep for sacrifice:</a>
<a id='line_6887'>  Their woolly fleeces, as the rites requir'd,</a>
<a id='line_6888'>  He laid beneath him, and to rest retir'd.</a>
<a id='line_6889'>  No sooner were his eyes in slumber bound,</a>
<a id='line_6890'>  When, from above, a more than mortal sound</a>
<a id='line_6891'>  Invades his ears; and thus the vision spoke:</a>
<a id='line_6892'>  "Seek not, my seed, in Latian bands to yoke</a>
<a id='line_6893'>  Our fair Lavinia, nor the gods provoke.</a>
<a id='line_6894'>  A foreign son upon thy shore descends,</a>
<a id='line_6895'>  Whose martial fame from pole to pole extends.</a>
<a id='line_6896'>  His race, in arms and arts of peace renown'd,</a>
<a id='line_6897'>  Not Latium shall contain, nor Europe bound:</a>
<a id='line_6898'>  'T is theirs whate'er the sun surveys around."</a>
<a id='line_6899'>  These answers, in the silent night receiv'd,</a>
<a id='line_6900'>  The king himself divulg'd, the land believ'd:</a>
<a id='line_6901'>  The fame thro' all the neighb'ring nations flew,</a>
<a id='line_6902'>  When now the Trojan navy was in view.</a>
<a id='line_6903'></a>
<a id='line_6904'>  Beneath a shady tree, the hero spread</a>
<a id='line_6905'>  His table on the turf, with cakes of bread;</a>
<a id='line_6906'>  And, with his chiefs, on forest fruits he fed.</a>
<a id='line_6907'>  They sate; and, (not without the god's command,)</a>
<a id='line_6908'>  Their homely fare dispatch'd, the hungry band</a>
<a id='line_6909'>  Invade their trenchers next, and soon devour,</a>
<a id='line_6910'>  To mend the scanty meal, their cakes of flour.</a>
<a id='line_6911'>  Ascanius this observ'd, and smiling said:</a>
<a id='line_6912'>  "See, we devour the plates on which we fed."</a>
<a id='line_6913'>  The speech had omen, that the Trojan race</a>
<a id='line_6914'>  Should find repose, and this the time and place.</a>
<a id='line_6915'>  Aeneas took the word, and thus replies,</a>
<a id='line_6916'>  Confessing fate with wonder in his eyes:</a>
<a id='line_6917'>  "All hail, O earth! all hail, my household gods!</a>
<a id='line_6918'>  Behold the destin'd place of your abodes!</a>
<a id='line_6919'>  For thus Anchises prophesied of old,</a>
<a id='line_6920'>  And this our fatal place of rest foretold:</a>
<a id='line_6921'>  'When, on a foreign shore, instead of meat,</a>
<a id='line_6922'>  By famine forc'd, your trenchers you shall eat,</a>
<a id='line_6923'>  Then ease your weary Trojans will attend,</a>
<a id='line_6924'>  And the long labors of your voyage end.</a>
<a id='line_6925'>  Remember on that happy coast to build,</a>
<a id='line_6926'>  And with a trench inclose the fruitful field.'</a>
<a id='line_6927'>  This was that famine, this the fatal place</a>
<a id='line_6928'>  Which ends the wand'ring of our exil'd race.</a>
<a id='line_6929'>  Then, on to-morrow's dawn, your care employ,</a>
<a id='line_6930'>  To search the land, and where the cities lie,</a>
<a id='line_6931'>  And what the men; but give this day to joy.</a>
<a id='line_6932'>  Now pour to Jove; and, after Jove is blest,</a>
<a id='line_6933'>  Call great Anchises to the genial feast:</a>
<a id='line_6934'>  Crown high the goblets with a cheerful draught;</a>
<a id='line_6935'>  Enjoy the present hour; adjourn the future thought."</a>
<a id='line_6936'></a>
<a id='line_6937'>  Thus having said, the hero bound his brows</a>
<a id='line_6938'>  With leafy branches, then perform'd his vows;</a>
<a id='line_6939'>  Adoring first the genius of the place,</a>
<a id='line_6940'>  Then Earth, the mother of the heav'nly race,</a>
<a id='line_6941'>  The nymphs, and native godheads yet unknown,</a>
<a id='line_6942'>  And Night, and all the stars that gild her sable throne,</a>
<a id='line_6943'>  And ancient Cybel, and Idaean Jove,</a>
<a id='line_6944'>  And last his sire below, and mother queen above.</a>
<a id='line_6945'>  Then heav'n's high monarch thunder'd thrice aloud,</a>
<a id='line_6946'>  And thrice he shook aloft a golden cloud.</a>
<a id='line_6947'>  Soon thro' the joyful camp a rumor flew,</a>
<a id='line_6948'>  The time was come their city to renew.</a>
<a id='line_6949'>  Then ev'ry brow with cheerful green is crown'd,</a>
<a id='line_6950'>  The feasts are doubled, and the bowls go round.</a>
<a id='line_6951'></a>
<a id='line_6952'>  When next the rosy morn disclos'd the day,</a>
<a id='line_6953'>  The scouts to sev'ral parts divide their way,</a>
<a id='line_6954'>  To learn the natives' names, their towns explore,</a>
<a id='line_6955'>  The coasts and trendings of the crooked shore:</a>
<a id='line_6956'>  Here Tiber flows, and here Numicus stands;</a>
<a id='line_6957'>  Here warlike Latins hold the happy lands.</a>
<a id='line_6958'>  The pious chief, who sought by peaceful ways</a>
<a id='line_6959'>  To found his empire, and his town to raise,</a>
<a id='line_6960'>  A hundred youths from all his train selects,</a>
<a id='line_6961'>  And to the Latian court their course directs,</a>
<a id='line_6962'>  (The spacious palace where their prince resides,)</a>
<a id='line_6963'>  And all their heads with wreaths of olive hides.</a>
<a id='line_6964'>  They go commission'd to require a peace,</a>
<a id='line_6965'>  And carry presents to procure access.</a>
<a id='line_6966'>  Thus while they speed their pace, the prince designs</a>
<a id='line_6967'>  His new-elected seat, and draws the lines.</a>
<a id='line_6968'>  The Trojans round the place a rampire cast,</a>
<a id='line_6969'>  And palisades about the trenches plac'd.</a>
<a id='line_6970'></a>
<a id='line_6971'>  Meantime the train, proceeding on their way,</a>
<a id='line_6972'>  From far the town and lofty tow'rs survey;</a>
<a id='line_6973'>  At length approach the walls. Without the gate,</a>
<a id='line_6974'>  They see the boys and Latian youth debate</a>
<a id='line_6975'>  The martial prizes on the dusty plain:</a>
<a id='line_6976'>  Some drive the cars, and some the coursers rein;</a>
<a id='line_6977'>  Some bend the stubborn bow for victory,</a>
<a id='line_6978'>  And some with darts their active sinews try.</a>
<a id='line_6979'>  A posting messenger, dispatch'd from hence,</a>
<a id='line_6980'>  Of this fair troop advis'd their aged prince,</a>
<a id='line_6981'>  That foreign men of mighty stature came;</a>
<a id='line_6982'>  Uncouth their habit, and unknown their name.</a>
<a id='line_6983'>  The king ordains their entrance, and ascends</a>
<a id='line_6984'>  His regal seat, surrounded by his friends.</a>
<a id='line_6985'></a>
<a id='line_6986'>  The palace built by Picus, vast and proud,</a>
<a id='line_6987'>  Supported by a hundred pillars stood,</a>
<a id='line_6988'>  And round incompass'd with a rising wood.</a>
<a id='line_6989'>  The pile o'erlook'd the town, and drew the sight;</a>
<a id='line_6990'>  Surpris'd at once with reverence and delight.</a>
<a id='line_6991'>  There kings receiv'd the marks of sov'reign pow'r;</a>
<a id='line_6992'>  In state the monarchs march'd; the lictors bore</a>
<a id='line_6993'>  Their awful axes and the rods before.</a>
<a id='line_6994'>  Here the tribunal stood, the house of pray'r,</a>
<a id='line_6995'>  And here the sacred senators repair;</a>
<a id='line_6996'>  All at large tables, in long order set,</a>
<a id='line_6997'>  A ram their off'ring, and a ram their meat.</a>
<a id='line_6998'>  Above the portal, carv'd in cedar wood,</a>
<a id='line_6999'>  Plac'd in their ranks, their godlike grandsires stood;</a>
<a id='line_7000'>  Old Saturn, with his crooked scythe, on high;</a>
<a id='line_7001'>  And Italus, that led the colony;</a>
<a id='line_7002'>  And ancient Janus, with his double face,</a>
<a id='line_7003'>  And bunch of keys, the porter of the place.</a>
<a id='line_7004'>  There good Sabinus, planter of the vines,</a>
<a id='line_7005'>  On a short pruning hook his head reclines,</a>
<a id='line_7006'>  And studiously surveys his gen'rous wines;</a>
<a id='line_7007'>  Then warlike kings, who for their country fought,</a>
<a id='line_7008'>  And honorable wounds from battle brought.</a>
<a id='line_7009'>  Around the posts hung helmets, darts, and spears,</a>
<a id='line_7010'>  And captive chariots, axes, shields, and bars,</a>
<a id='line_7011'>  And broken beaks of ships, the trophies of their wars.</a>
<a id='line_7012'>  Above the rest, as chief of all the band,</a>
<a id='line_7013'>  Was Picus plac'd, a buckler in his hand;</a>
<a id='line_7014'>  His other wav'd a long divining wand.</a>
<a id='line_7015'>  Girt in his Gabin gown the hero sate,</a>
<a id='line_7016'>  Yet could not with his art avoid his fate:</a>
<a id='line_7017'>  For Circe long had lov'd the youth in vain,</a>
<a id='line_7018'>  Till love, refus'd, converted to disdain:</a>
<a id='line_7019'>  Then, mixing pow'rful herbs, with magic art,</a>
<a id='line_7020'>  She chang'd his form, who could not change his heart;</a>
<a id='line_7021'>  Constrain'd him in a bird, and made him fly,</a>
<a id='line_7022'>  With party-color'd plumes, a chatt'ring pie.</a>
<a id='line_7023'></a>
<a id='line_7024'>  In this high temple, on a chair of state,</a>
<a id='line_7025'>  The seat of audience, old Latinus sate;</a>
<a id='line_7026'>  Then gave admission to the Trojan train;</a>
<a id='line_7027'>  And thus with pleasing accents he began:</a>
<a id='line_7028'>  "Tell me, ye Trojans, for that name you own,</a>
<a id='line_7029'>  Nor is your course upon our coasts unknown-</a>
<a id='line_7030'>  Say what you seek, and whither were you bound:</a>
<a id='line_7031'>  Were you by stress of weather cast aground?</a>
<a id='line_7032'>  (Such dangers as on seas are often seen,</a>
<a id='line_7033'>  And oft befall to miserable men,)</a>
<a id='line_7034'>  Or come, your shipping in our ports to lay,</a>
<a id='line_7035'>  Spent and disabled in so long a way?</a>
<a id='line_7036'>  Say what you want: the Latians you shall find</a>
<a id='line_7037'>  Not forc'd to goodness, but by will inclin'd;</a>
<a id='line_7038'>  For, since the time of Saturn's holy reign,</a>
<a id='line_7039'>  His hospitable customs we retain.</a>
<a id='line_7040'>  I call to mind (but time the tale has worn)</a>
<a id='line_7041'>  Th' Arunci told, that Dardanus, tho' born</a>
<a id='line_7042'>  On Latian plains, yet sought the Phrygian shore,</a>
<a id='line_7043'>  And Samothracia, Samos call'd before.</a>
<a id='line_7044'>  From Tuscan Coritum he claim'd his birth;</a>
<a id='line_7045'>  But after, when exempt from mortal earth,</a>
<a id='line_7046'>  From thence ascended to his kindred skies,</a>
<a id='line_7047'>  A god, and, as a god, augments their sacrifice,"</a>
<a id='line_7048'></a>
<a id='line_7049'>  He said. Ilioneus made this reply:</a>
<a id='line_7050'>  "O king, of Faunus' royal family!</a>
<a id='line_7051'>  Nor wintry winds to Latium forc'd our way,</a>
<a id='line_7052'>  Nor did the stars our wand'ring course betray.</a>
<a id='line_7053'>  Willing we sought your shores; and, hither bound,</a>
<a id='line_7054'>  The port, so long desir'd, at length we found;</a>
<a id='line_7055'>  From our sweet homes and ancient realms expell'd;</a>
<a id='line_7056'>  Great as the greatest that the sun beheld.</a>
<a id='line_7057'>  The god began our line, who rules above;</a>
<a id='line_7058'>  And, as our race, our king descends from Jove:</a>
<a id='line_7059'>  And hither are we come, by his command,</a>
<a id='line_7060'>  To crave admission in your happy land.</a>
<a id='line_7061'>  How dire a tempest, from Mycenae pour'd,</a>
<a id='line_7062'>  Our plains, our temples, and our town devour'd;</a>
<a id='line_7063'>  What was the waste of war, what fierce alarms</a>
<a id='line_7064'>  Shook Asia's crown with European arms;</a>
<a id='line_7065'>  Ev'n such have heard, if any such there be,</a>
<a id='line_7066'>  Whose earth is bounded by the frozen sea;</a>
<a id='line_7067'>  And such as, born beneath the burning sky</a>
<a id='line_7068'>  And sultry sun, betwixt the tropics lie.</a>
<a id='line_7069'>  From that dire deluge, thro' the wat'ry waste,</a>
<a id='line_7070'>  Such length of years, such various perils past,</a>
<a id='line_7071'>  At last escap'd, to Latium we repair,</a>
<a id='line_7072'>  To beg what you without your want may spare:</a>
<a id='line_7073'>  The common water, and the common air;</a>
<a id='line_7074'>  Sheds which ourselves will build, and mean abodes,</a>
<a id='line_7075'>  Fit to receive and serve our banish'd gods.</a>
<a id='line_7076'>  Nor our admission shall your realm disgrace,</a>
<a id='line_7077'>  Nor length of time our gratitude efface.</a>
<a id='line_7078'>  Besides, what endless honor you shall gain,</a>
<a id='line_7079'>  To save and shelter Troy's unhappy train!</a>
<a id='line_7080'>  Now, by my sov'reign, and his fate, I swear,</a>
<a id='line_7081'>  Renown'd for faith in peace, for force in war;</a>
<a id='line_7082'>  Oft our alliance other lands desir'd,</a>
<a id='line_7083'>  And, what we seek of you, of us requir'd.</a>
<a id='line_7084'>  Despite not then, that in our hands we bear</a>
<a id='line_7085'>  These holy boughs, sue with words of pray'r.</a>
<a id='line_7086'>  Fate and the gods, by their supreme command,</a>
<a id='line_7087'>  Have doom'd our ships to seek the Latian land.</a>
<a id='line_7088'>  To these abodes our fleet Apollo sends;</a>
<a id='line_7089'>  Here Dardanus was born, and hither tends;</a>
<a id='line_7090'>  Where Tuscan Tiber rolls with rapid force,</a>
<a id='line_7091'>  And where Numicus opes his holy source.</a>
<a id='line_7092'>  Besides, our prince presents, with his request,</a>
<a id='line_7093'>  Some small remains of what his sire possess'd.</a>
<a id='line_7094'>  This golden charger, snatch'd from burning Troy,</a>
<a id='line_7095'>  Anchises did in sacrifice employ;</a>
<a id='line_7096'>  This royal robe and this tiara wore</a>
<a id='line_7097'>  Old Priam, and this golden scepter bore</a>
<a id='line_7098'>  In full assemblies, and in solemn games;</a>
<a id='line_7099'>  These purple vests were weav'd by Dardan dames."</a>
<a id='line_7100'></a>
<a id='line_7101'>  Thus while he spoke, Latinus roll'd around</a>
<a id='line_7102'>  His eyes, and fix'd a while upon the ground.</a>
<a id='line_7103'>  Intent he seem'd, and anxious in his breast;</a>
<a id='line_7104'>  Not by the scepter mov'd, or kingly vest,</a>
<a id='line_7105'>  But pond'ring future things of wondrous weight;</a>
<a id='line_7106'>  Succession, empire, and his daughter's fate.</a>
<a id='line_7107'>  On these he mus'd within his thoughtful mind,</a>
<a id='line_7108'>  And then revolv'd what Faunus had divin'd.</a>
<a id='line_7109'>  This was the foreign prince, by fate decreed</a>
<a id='line_7110'>  To share his scepter, and Lavinia's bed;</a>
<a id='line_7111'>  This was the race that sure portents foreshew</a>
<a id='line_7112'>  To sway the world, and land and sea subdue.</a>
<a id='line_7113'>  At length he rais'd his cheerful head, and spoke:</a>
<a id='line_7114'>  "The pow'rs," said he, "the pow'rs we both invoke,</a>
<a id='line_7115'>  To you, and yours, and mine, propitious be,</a>
<a id='line_7116'>  And firm our purpose with their augury!</a>
<a id='line_7117'>  Have what you ask; your presents I receive;</a>
<a id='line_7118'>  Land, where and when you please, with ample leave;</a>
<a id='line_7119'>  Partake and use my kingdom as your own;</a>
<a id='line_7120'>  All shall be yours, while I command the crown:</a>
<a id='line_7121'>  And, if my wish'd alliance please your king,</a>
<a id='line_7122'>  Tell him he should not send the peace, but bring.</a>
<a id='line_7123'>  Then let him not a friend's embraces fear;</a>
<a id='line_7124'>  The peace is made when I behold him here.</a>
<a id='line_7125'>  Besides this answer, tell my royal guest,</a>
<a id='line_7126'>  I add to his commands my own request:</a>
<a id='line_7127'>  One only daughter heirs my crown and state,</a>
<a id='line_7128'>  Whom not our oracles, nor Heav'n, nor fate,</a>
<a id='line_7129'>  Nor frequent prodigies, permit to join</a>
<a id='line_7130'>  With any native of th' Ausonian line.</a>
<a id='line_7131'>  A foreign son-in-law shall come from far</a>
<a id='line_7132'>  (Such is our doom), a chief renown'd in war,</a>
<a id='line_7133'>  Whose race shall bear aloft the Latian name,</a>
<a id='line_7134'>  And thro' the conquer'd world diffuse our fame.</a>
<a id='line_7135'>  Himself to be the man the fates require,</a>
<a id='line_7136'>  I firmly judge, and, what I judge, desire."</a>
<a id='line_7137'></a>
<a id='line_7138'>  He said, and then on each bestow'd a steed.</a>
<a id='line_7139'>  Three hundred horses, in high stables fed,</a>
<a id='line_7140'>  Stood ready, shining all, and smoothly dress'd:</a>
<a id='line_7141'>  Of these he chose the fairest and the best,</a>
<a id='line_7142'>  To mount the Trojan troop. At his command</a>
<a id='line_7143'>  The steeds caparison'd with purple stand,</a>
<a id='line_7144'>  With golden trappings, glorious to behold,</a>
<a id='line_7145'>  And champ betwixt their teeth the foaming gold.</a>
<a id='line_7146'>  Then to his absent guest the king decreed</a>
<a id='line_7147'>  A pair of coursers born of heav'nly breed,</a>
<a id='line_7148'>  Who from their nostrils breath'd ethereal fire;</a>
<a id='line_7149'>  Whom Circe stole from her celestial sire,</a>
<a id='line_7150'>  By substituting mares produc'd on earth,</a>
<a id='line_7151'>  Whose wombs conceiv'd a more than mortal birth.</a>
<a id='line_7152'>  These draw the chariot which Latinus sends,</a>
<a id='line_7153'>  And the rich present to the prince commends.</a>
<a id='line_7154'>  Sublime on stately steeds the Trojans borne,</a>
<a id='line_7155'>  To their expecting lord with peace return.</a>
<a id='line_7156'></a>
<a id='line_7157'>  But jealous Juno, from Pachynus' height,</a>
<a id='line_7158'>  As she from Argos took her airy flight,</a>
<a id='line_7159'>  Beheld with envious eyes this hateful sight.</a>
<a id='line_7160'>  She saw the Trojan and his joyful train</a>
<a id='line_7161'>  Descend upon the shore, desert the main,</a>
<a id='line_7162'>  Design a town, and, with unhop'd success,</a>
<a id='line_7163'>  Th' embassadors return with promis'd peace.</a>
<a id='line_7164'>  Then, pierc'd with pain, she shook her haughty head,</a>
<a id='line_7165'>  Sigh'd from her inward soul, and thus she said:</a>
<a id='line_7166'>  "O hated offspring of my Phrygian foes!</a>
<a id='line_7167'>  O fates of Troy, which Juno's fates oppose!</a>
<a id='line_7168'>  Could they not fall unpitied on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_7169'>  But slain revive, and, taken, scape again?</a>
<a id='line_7170'>  When execrable Troy in ashes lay,</a>
<a id='line_7171'>  Thro' fires and swords and seas they forc'd their way.</a>
<a id='line_7172'>  Then vanquish'd Juno must in vain contend,</a>
<a id='line_7173'>  Her rage disarm'd, her empire at an end.</a>
<a id='line_7174'>  Breathless and tir'd, is all my fury spent?</a>
<a id='line_7175'>  Or does my glutted spleen at length relent?</a>
<a id='line_7176'>  As if 't were little from their town to chase,</a>
<a id='line_7177'>  I thro' the seas pursued their exil'd race;</a>
<a id='line_7178'>  Ingag'd the heav'ns, oppos'd the stormy main;</a>
<a id='line_7179'>  But billows roar'd, and tempests rag'd in vain.</a>
<a id='line_7180'>  What have my Scyllas and my Syrtes done,</a>
<a id='line_7181'>  When these they overpass, and those they shun?</a>
<a id='line_7182'>  On Tiber's shores they land, secure of fate,</a>
<a id='line_7183'>  Triumphant o'er the storms and Juno's hate.</a>
<a id='line_7184'>  Mars could in mutual blood the Centaurs bathe,</a>
<a id='line_7185'>  And Jove himself gave way to Cynthia's wrath,</a>
<a id='line_7186'>  Who sent the tusky boar to Calydon;</a>
<a id='line_7187'>  (What great offense had either people done?)</a>
<a id='line_7188'>  But I, the consort of the Thunderer,</a>
<a id='line_7189'>  Have wag'd a long and unsuccessful war,</a>
<a id='line_7190'>  With various arts and arms in vain have toil'd,</a>
<a id='line_7191'>  And by a mortal man at length am foil'd.</a>
<a id='line_7192'>  If native pow'r prevail not, shall I doubt</a>
<a id='line_7193'>  To seek for needful succor from without?</a>
<a id='line_7194'>  If Jove and Heav'n my just desires deny,</a>
<a id='line_7195'>  Hell shall the pow'r of Heav'n and Jove supply.</a>
<a id='line_7196'>  Grant that the Fates have firm'd, by their decree,</a>
<a id='line_7197'>  The Trojan race to reign in Italy;</a>
<a id='line_7198'>  At least I can defer the nuptial day,</a>
<a id='line_7199'>  And with protracted wars the peace delay:</a>
<a id='line_7200'>  With blood the dear alliance shall be bought,</a>
<a id='line_7201'>  And both the people near destruction brought;</a>
<a id='line_7202'>  So shall the son-in-law and father join,</a>
<a id='line_7203'>  With ruin, war, and waste of either line.</a>
<a id='line_7204'>  O fatal maid, thy marriage is endow'd</a>
<a id='line_7205'>  With Phrygian, Latian, and Rutulian blood!</a>
<a id='line_7206'>  Bellona leads thee to thy lover's hand;</a>
<a id='line_7207'>  Another queen brings forth another brand,</a>
<a id='line_7208'>  To burn with foreign fires another land!</a>
<a id='line_7209'>  A second Paris, diff'ring but in name,</a>
<a id='line_7210'>  Shall fire his country with a second flame."</a>
<a id='line_7211'></a>
<a id='line_7212'>  Thus having said, she sinks beneath the ground,</a>
<a id='line_7213'>  With furious haste, and shoots the Stygian sound,</a>
<a id='line_7214'>  To rouse Alecto from th' infernal seat</a>
<a id='line_7215'>  Of her dire sisters, and their dark retreat.</a>
<a id='line_7216'>  This Fury, fit for her intent, she chose;</a>
<a id='line_7217'>  One who delights in wars and human woes.</a>
<a id='line_7218'>  Ev'n Pluto hates his own misshapen race;</a>
<a id='line_7219'>  Her sister Furies fly her hideous face;</a>
<a id='line_7220'>  So frightful are the forms the monster takes,</a>
<a id='line_7221'>  So fierce the hissings of her speckled snakes.</a>
<a id='line_7222'>  Her Juno finds, and thus inflames her spite:</a>
<a id='line_7223'>  "O virgin daughter of eternal Night,</a>
<a id='line_7224'>  Give me this once thy labor, to sustain</a>
<a id='line_7225'>  My right, and execute my just disdain.</a>
<a id='line_7226'>  Let not the Trojans, with a feign'd pretense</a>
<a id='line_7227'>  Of proffer'd peace, delude the Latian prince.</a>
<a id='line_7228'>  Expel from Italy that odious name,</a>
<a id='line_7229'>  And let not Juno suffer in her fame.</a>
<a id='line_7230'>  'T is thine to ruin realms, o'erturn a state,</a>
<a id='line_7231'>  Betwixt the dearest friends to raise debate,</a>
<a id='line_7232'>  And kindle kindred blood to mutual hate.</a>
<a id='line_7233'>  Thy hand o'er towns the fun'ral torch displays,</a>
<a id='line_7234'>  And forms a thousand ills ten thousand ways.</a>
<a id='line_7235'>  Now shake, out thy fruitful breast, the seeds</a>
<a id='line_7236'>  Of envy, discord, and of cruel deeds:</a>
<a id='line_7237'>  Confound the peace establish'd, and prepare</a>
<a id='line_7238'>  Their souls to hatred, and their hands to war."</a>
<a id='line_7239'></a>
<a id='line_7240'>  Smear'd as she was with black Gorgonian blood,</a>
<a id='line_7241'>  The Fury sprang above the Stygian flood;</a>
<a id='line_7242'>  And on her wicker wings, sublime thro' night,</a>
<a id='line_7243'>  She to the Latian palace took her flight:</a>
<a id='line_7244'>  There sought the queen's apartment, stood before</a>
<a id='line_7245'>  The peaceful threshold, and besieg'd the door.</a>
<a id='line_7246'>  Restless Amata lay, her swelling breast</a>
<a id='line_7247'>  Fir'd with disdain for Turnus dispossess'd,</a>
<a id='line_7248'>  And the new nuptials of the Trojan guest.</a>
<a id='line_7249'>  From her black bloody locks the Fury shakes</a>
<a id='line_7250'>  Her darling plague, the fav'rite of her snakes;</a>
<a id='line_7251'>  With her full force she threw the poisonous dart,</a>
<a id='line_7252'>  And fix'd it deep within Amata's heart,</a>
<a id='line_7253'>  That, thus envenom'd, she might kindle rage,</a>
<a id='line_7254'>  And sacrifice to strife her house husband's age.</a>
<a id='line_7255'>  Unseen, unfelt, the fiery serpent skims</a>
<a id='line_7256'>  Betwixt her linen and her naked limbs;</a>
<a id='line_7257'>  His baleful breath inspiring, as he glides,</a>
<a id='line_7258'>  Now like a chain around her neck he rides,</a>
<a id='line_7259'>  Now like a fillet to her head repairs,</a>
<a id='line_7260'>  And with his circling volumes folds her hairs.</a>
<a id='line_7261'>  At first the silent venom slid with ease,</a>
<a id='line_7262'>  And seiz'd her cooler senses by degrees;</a>
<a id='line_7263'>  Then, ere th' infected mass was fir'd too far,</a>
<a id='line_7264'>  In plaintive accents she began the war,</a>
<a id='line_7265'>  And thus bespoke her husband: "Shall," she said,</a>
<a id='line_7266'>  "A wand'ring prince enjoy Lavinia's bed?</a>
<a id='line_7267'>  If nature plead not in a parent's heart,</a>
<a id='line_7268'>  Pity my tears, and pity her desert.</a>
<a id='line_7269'>  I know, my dearest lord, the time will come,</a>
<a id='line_7270'>  You in vain, reverse your cruel doom;</a>
<a id='line_7271'>  The faithless pirate soon will set to sea,</a>
<a id='line_7272'>  And bear the royal virgin far away!</a>
<a id='line_7273'>  A guest like him, a Trojan guest before,</a>
<a id='line_7274'>  In shew of friendship sought the Spartan shore,</a>
<a id='line_7275'>  And ravish'd Helen from her husband bore.</a>
<a id='line_7276'>  Think on a king's inviolable word;</a>
<a id='line_7277'>  And think on Turnus, her once plighted lord:</a>
<a id='line_7278'>  To this false foreigner you give your throne,</a>
<a id='line_7279'>  And wrong a friend, a kinsman, and a son.</a>
<a id='line_7280'>  Resume your ancient care; and, if the god</a>
<a id='line_7281'>  Your sire, and you, resolve on foreign blood,</a>
<a id='line_7282'>  Know all are foreign, in a larger sense,</a>
<a id='line_7283'>  Not born your subjects, or deriv'd from hence.</a>
<a id='line_7284'>  Then, if the line of Turnus you retrace,</a>
<a id='line_7285'>  He springs from Inachus of Argive race."</a>
<a id='line_7286'></a>
<a id='line_7287'>  But when she saw her reasons idly spent,</a>
<a id='line_7288'>  And could not move him from his fix'd intent,</a>
<a id='line_7289'>  She flew to rage; for now the snake possess'd</a>
<a id='line_7290'>  Her vital parts, and poison'd all her breast;</a>
<a id='line_7291'>  She raves, she runs with a distracted pace,</a>
<a id='line_7292'>  And fills with horrid howls the public place.</a>
<a id='line_7293'>  And, as young striplings whip the top for sport,</a>
<a id='line_7294'>  On the smooth pavement of an empty court;</a>
<a id='line_7295'>  The wooden engine flies and whirls about,</a>
<a id='line_7296'>  Admir'd, with clamors, of the beardless rout;</a>
<a id='line_7297'>  They lash aloud; each other they provoke,</a>
<a id='line_7298'>  And lend their little souls at ev'ry stroke:</a>
<a id='line_7299'>  Thus fares the queen; and thus her fury blows</a>
<a id='line_7300'>  Amidst the crowd, and kindles as she goes.</a>
<a id='line_7301'>  Nor yet content, she strains her malice more,</a>
<a id='line_7302'>  And adds new ills to those contriv'd before:</a>
<a id='line_7303'>  She flies the town, and, mixing with a throng</a>
<a id='line_7304'>  Of madding matrons, bears the bride along,</a>
<a id='line_7305'>  Wand'ring thro' woods and wilds, and devious ways,</a>
<a id='line_7306'>  And with these arts the Trojan match delays.</a>
<a id='line_7307'>  She feign'd the rites of Bacchus; cried aloud,</a>
<a id='line_7308'>  And to the buxom god the virgin vow'd.</a>
<a id='line_7309'>  "Evoe! O Bacchus!" thus began the song;</a>
<a id='line_7310'>  And "Evoe!" answer'd all the female throng.</a>
<a id='line_7311'>  "O virgin! worthy thee alone!" she cried;</a>
<a id='line_7312'>  "O worthy thee alone!" the crew replied.</a>
<a id='line_7313'>  "For thee she feeds her hair, she leads thy dance,</a>
<a id='line_7314'>  And with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance."</a>
<a id='line_7315'>  Like fury seiz'd the rest; the progress known,</a>
<a id='line_7316'>  All seek the mountains, and forsake the town:</a>
<a id='line_7317'>  All, clad in skins of beasts, the jav'lin bear,</a>
<a id='line_7318'>  Give to the wanton winds their flowing hair,</a>
<a id='line_7319'>  And shrieks and shoutings rend the suff'ring air.</a>
<a id='line_7320'>  The queen herself, inspir'd with rage divine,</a>
<a id='line_7321'>  Shook high above her head a flaming pine;</a>
<a id='line_7322'>  Then roll'd her haggard eyes around the throng,</a>
<a id='line_7323'>  And sung, in Turnus' name, the nuptial song:</a>
<a id='line_7324'>  "Io, ye Latian dames! if any here</a>
<a id='line_7325'>  Hold your unhappy queen, Amata, dear;</a>
<a id='line_7326'>  If there be here," she said, "who dare maintain</a>
<a id='line_7327'>  My right, nor think the name of mother vain;</a>
<a id='line_7328'>  Unbind your fillets, loose your flowing hair,</a>
<a id='line_7329'>  And orgies and nocturnal rites prepare."</a>
<a id='line_7330'></a>
<a id='line_7331'>  Amata's breast the Fury thus invades,</a>
<a id='line_7332'>  And fires with rage, amid the sylvan shades;</a>
<a id='line_7333'>  Then, when she found her venom spread so far,</a>
<a id='line_7334'>  The royal house embroil'd in civil war,</a>
<a id='line_7335'>  Rais'd on her dusky wings, she cleaves the skies,</a>
<a id='line_7336'>  And seeks the palace where young Turnus lies.</a>
<a id='line_7337'>  His town, as fame reports, was built of old</a>
<a id='line_7338'>  By Danae, pregnant with almighty gold,</a>
<a id='line_7339'>  Who fled her father's rage, and, with a train</a>
<a id='line_7340'>  Of following Argives, thro' the stormy main,</a>
<a id='line_7341'>  Driv'n by the southern blasts, was fated here to reign.</a>
<a id='line_7342'>  'T was Ardua once; now Ardea's name it bears;</a>
<a id='line_7343'>  Once a fair city, now consum'd with years.</a>
<a id='line_7344'>  Here, in his lofty palace, Turnus lay,</a>
<a id='line_7345'>  Betwixt the confines of the night and day,</a>
<a id='line_7346'>  Secure in sleep. The Fury laid aside</a>
<a id='line_7347'>  Her looks and limbs, and with new methods tried</a>
<a id='line_7348'>  The foulness of th' infernal form to hide.</a>
<a id='line_7349'>  Propp'd on a staff, she takes a trembling mien:</a>
<a id='line_7350'>  Her face is furrow'd, and her front obscene;</a>
<a id='line_7351'>  Deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws;</a>
<a id='line_7352'>  Sunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws;</a>
<a id='line_7353'>  Her hoary hair with holy fillets bound,</a>
<a id='line_7354'>  Her temples with an olive wreath are crown'd.</a>
<a id='line_7355'>  Old Chalybe, who kept the sacred fane</a>
<a id='line_7356'>  Of Juno, now she seem'd, and thus began,</a>
<a id='line_7357'>  Appearing in a dream, to rouse the careless man:</a>
<a id='line_7358'>  "Shall Turnus then such endless toil sustain</a>
<a id='line_7359'>  In fighting fields, and conquer towns in vain?</a>
<a id='line_7360'>  Win, for a Trojan head to wear the prize,</a>
<a id='line_7361'>  Usurp thy crown, enjoy thy victories?</a>
<a id='line_7362'>  The bride and scepter which thy blood has bought,</a>

<a id='line_7370'>  Haste; arm your Ardeans; issue to the plain;</a>
<a id='line_7371'>  With fate to friend, assault the Trojan train:</a>
<a id='line_7372'>  Their thoughtless chiefs, their painted ships, that lie</a>
<a id='line_7373'>  In Tiber's mouth, with fire and sword destroy.</a>
<a id='line_7374'>  The Latian king, unless he shall submit,</a>
<a id='line_7375'>  Own his old promise, and his new forget-</a>
<a id='line_7376'>  Let him, in arms, the pow'r of Turnus prove,</a>
<a id='line_7377'>  And learn to fear whom he disdains to love.</a>
<a id='line_7378'>  For such is Heav'n's command." The youthful prince</a>
<a id='line_7379'>  With scorn replied, and made this bold defense:</a>
<a id='line_7380'>  "You tell me, mother, what I knew before:</a>
<a id='line_7381'>  The Phrygian fleet is landed on the shore.</a>
<a id='line_7382'>  I neither fear nor will provoke the war;</a>
<a id='line_7383'>  My fate is Juno's most peculiar care.</a>
<a id='line_7384'>  But time has made you dote, and vainly tell</a>
<a id='line_7385'>  Of arms imagin'd in your lonely cell.</a>
<a id='line_7386'>  Go; be the temple and the gods your care;</a>
<a id='line_7387'>  Permit to men the thought of peace and war."</a>
<a id='line_7388'></a>
<a id='line_7389'>  These haughty words Alecto's rage provoke,</a>
<a id='line_7390'>  And frighted Turnus trembled as she spoke.</a>
<a id='line_7391'>  Her eyes grow stiffen'd, and with sulphur burn;</a>
<a id='line_7392'>  Her hideous looks and hellish form return;</a>
<a id='line_7393'>  Her curling snakes with hissings fill the place,</a>
<a id='line_7394'>  And open all the furies of her face:</a>
<a id='line_7395'>  Then, darting fire from her malignant eyes,</a>
<a id='line_7396'>  She cast him backward as he strove to rise,</a>
<a id='line_7397'>  And, ling'ring, sought to frame some new replies.</a>
<a id='line_7398'>  High on her head she rears two twisted snakes,</a>
<a id='line_7399'>  Her chains she rattles, and her whip she shakes;</a>
<a id='line_7400'>  And, churning bloody foam, thus loudly speaks:</a>
<a id='line_7401'>  "Behold whom time has made to dote, and tell</a>
<a id='line_7402'>  Of arms imagin'd in her lonely cell!</a>
<a id='line_7403'>  Behold the Fates' infernal minister!</a>
<a id='line_7404'>  War, death, destruction, in my hand I bear."</a>
<a id='line_7405'></a>
<a id='line_7406'>  Thus having said, her smold'ring torch, impress'd</a>
<a id='line_7407'>  With her full force, she plung'd into his breast.</a>
<a id='line_7408'>  Aghast he wak'd; and, starting from his bed,</a>
<a id='line_7409'>  Cold sweat, in clammy drops, his limbs o'erspread.</a>
<a id='line_7410'>  "Arms! arms!" he cries: "my sword and shield prepare!"</a>
<a id='line_7411'>  He breathes defiance, blood, and mortal war.</a>
<a id='line_7412'>  So, when with crackling flames a caldron fries,</a>
<a id='line_7413'>  The bubbling waters from the bottom rise:</a>
<a id='line_7414'>  Above the brims they force their fiery way;</a>
<a id='line_7415'>  Black vapors climb aloft, and cloud the day.</a>
<a id='line_7416'></a>
<a id='line_7417'>  The peace polluted thus, a chosen band</a>
<a id='line_7418'>  He first commissions to the Latian land,</a>
<a id='line_7419'>  In threat'ning embassy; then rais'd the rest,</a>
<a id='line_7420'>  To meet in arms th' intruding Trojan guest,</a>
<a id='line_7421'>  To force the foes from the Lavinian shore,</a>
<a id='line_7422'>  And Italy's indanger'd peace restore.</a>
<a id='line_7423'>  Himself alone an equal match he boasts,</a>
<a id='line_7424'>  To fight the Phrygian and Ausonian hosts.</a>
<a id='line_7425'>  The gods invok'd, the Rutuli prepare</a>
<a id='line_7426'>  Their arms, and warn each other to the war.</a>
<a id='line_7427'>  His beauty these, and those his blooming age,</a>
<a id='line_7428'>  The rest his house and his own fame ingage.</a>
<a id='line_7429'></a>
<a id='line_7430'>  While Turnus urges thus his enterprise,</a>
<a id='line_7431'>  The Stygian Fury to the Trojans flies;</a>
<a id='line_7432'>  New frauds invents, and takes a steepy stand,</a>
<a id='line_7433'>  Which overlooks the vale with wide command;</a>
<a id='line_7434'>  Where fair Ascanius and his youthful train,</a>
<a id='line_7435'>  With horns and hounds, a hunting match ordain,</a>
<a id='line_7436'>  And pitch their toils around the shady plain.</a>
<a id='line_7437'>  The Fury fires the pack; they snuff, they vent,</a>
<a id='line_7438'>  And feed their hungry nostrils with the scent.</a>
<a id='line_7439'>  'Twas of a well-grown stag, whose antlers rise</a>
<a id='line_7440'>  High o'er his front; his beams invade the skies.</a>
<a id='line_7441'>  From this light cause th' infernal maid prepares</a>
<a id='line_7442'>  The country churls to mischief, hate, and wars.</a>
<a id='line_7443'></a>
<a id='line_7444'>  The stately beast the two Tyrrhidae bred,</a>
<a id='line_7445'>  Snatch'd from his dams, and the tame youngling fed.</a>
<a id='line_7446'>  Their father Tyrrheus did his fodder bring,</a>
<a id='line_7447'>  Tyrrheus, chief ranger to the Latian king:</a>
<a id='line_7448'>  Their sister Silvia cherish'd with her care</a>
<a id='line_7449'>  The little wanton, and did wreaths prepare</a>
<a id='line_7450'>  To hang his budding horns, with ribbons tied</a>
<a id='line_7451'>  His tender neck, and comb'd his silken hide,</a>
<a id='line_7452'>  And bathed his body. Patient of command</a>
<a id='line_7453'>  In time he grew, and, growing us'd to hand,</a>
<a id='line_7454'>  He waited at his master's board for food;</a>
<a id='line_7455'>  Then sought his salvage kindred in the wood,</a>
<a id='line_7456'>  Where grazing all the day, at night he came</a>
<a id='line_7457'>  To his known lodgings, and his country dame.</a>
<a id='line_7458'></a>
<a id='line_7459'>  This household beast, that us'd the woodland grounds,</a>
<a id='line_7460'>  Was view'd at first by the young hero's hounds,</a>
<a id='line_7461'>  As down the stream he swam, to seek retreat</a>
<a id='line_7462'>  In the cool waters, and to quench his heat.</a>
<a id='line_7463'>  Ascanius young, and eager of his game,</a>
<a id='line_7464'>  Soon bent his bow, uncertain in his aim;</a>
<a id='line_7465'>  But the dire fiend the fatal arrow guides,</a>
<a id='line_7466'>  Which pierc'd his bowels thro' his panting sides.</a>
<a id='line_7467'>  The bleeding creature issues from the floods,</a>
<a id='line_7468'>  Possess'd with fear, and seeks his known abodes,</a>
<a id='line_7469'>  His old familiar hearth and household gods.</a>
<a id='line_7470'>  He falls; he fills the house with heavy groans,</a>
<a id='line_7471'>  Implores their pity, and his pain bemoans.</a>
<a id='line_7472'>  Young Silvia beats her breast, and cries aloud</a>
<a id='line_7473'>  For succor from the clownish neighborhood:</a>
<a id='line_7474'>  The churls assemble; for the fiend, who lay</a>
<a id='line_7475'>  In the close woody covert, urg'd their way.</a>
<a id='line_7476'>  One with a brand yet burning from the flame,</a>
<a id='line_7477'>  Arm'd with a knotty club another came:</a>
<a id='line_7478'>  Whate'er they catch or find, without their care,</a>
<a id='line_7479'>  Their fury makes an instrument of war.</a>
<a id='line_7480'>  Tyrrheus, the foster father of the beast,</a>
<a id='line_7481'>  Then clench'd a hatchet in his horny fist,</a>
<a id='line_7482'>  But held his hand from the descending stroke,</a>
<a id='line_7483'>  And left his wedge within the cloven oak,</a>
<a id='line_7484'>  To whet their courage and their rage provoke.</a>
<a id='line_7485'>  And now the goddess, exercis'd in ill,</a>
<a id='line_7486'>  Who watch'd an hour to work her impious will,</a>
<a id='line_7487'>  Ascends the roof, and to her crooked horn,</a>
<a id='line_7488'>  Such as was then by Latian shepherds borne,</a>
<a id='line_7489'>  Adds all her breath: the rocks and woods around,</a>
<a id='line_7490'>  And mountains, tremble at th' infernal sound.</a>
<a id='line_7491'>  The sacred lake of Trivia from afar,</a>
<a id='line_7492'>  The Veline fountains, and sulphureous Nar,</a>
<a id='line_7493'>  Shake at the baleful blast, the signal of the war.</a>
<a id='line_7494'>  Young mothers wildly stare, with fear possess'd,</a>
<a id='line_7495'>  And strain their helpless infants to their breast.</a>
<a id='line_7496'></a>
<a id='line_7497'>  The clowns, a boist'rous, rude, ungovern'd crew,</a>
<a id='line_7498'>  With furious haste to the loud summons flew.</a>
<a id='line_7499'>  The pow'rs of Troy, then issuing on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_7500'>  With fresh recruits their youthful chief sustain:</a>
<a id='line_7501'>  Not theirs a raw and unexperienc'd train,</a>
<a id='line_7502'>  But a firm body of embattled men.</a>
<a id='line_7503'>  At first, while fortune favor'd neither side,</a>
<a id='line_7504'>  The fight with clubs and burning brands was tried;</a>
<a id='line_7505'>  But now, both parties reinforc'd, the fields</a>
<a id='line_7506'>  Are bright with flaming swords and brazen shields.</a>
<a id='line_7507'>  A shining harvest either host displays,</a>
<a id='line_7508'>  And shoots against the sun with equal rays.</a>
<a id='line_7509'>  Thus, when a black-brow'd gust begins to rise,</a>
<a id='line_7510'>  White foam at first on the curl'd ocean fries;</a>
<a id='line_7511'>  Then roars the main, the billows mount the skies;</a>
<a id='line_7512'>  Till, by the fury of the storm full blown,</a>
<a id='line_7513'>  The muddy bottom o'er the clouds is thrown.</a>
<a id='line_7514'>  First Almon falls, old Tyrrheus' eldest care,</a>
<a id='line_7515'>  Pierc'd with an arrow from the distant war:</a>
<a id='line_7516'>  Fix'd in his throat the flying weapon stood,</a>
<a id='line_7517'>  And stopp'd his breath, and drank his vital blood</a>
<a id='line_7518'>  Huge heaps of slain around the body rise:</a>
<a id='line_7519'>  Among the rest, the rich Galesus lies;</a>
<a id='line_7520'>  A good old man, while peace he preach'd in vain,</a>
<a id='line_7521'>  Amidst the madness of th' unruly train:</a>
<a id='line_7522'>  Five herds, five bleating flocks, his pastures fill'd;</a>
<a id='line_7523'>  His lands a hundred yoke of oxen till'd.</a>
<a id='line_7524'></a>
<a id='line_7525'>  Thus, while in equal scales their fortune stood</a>
<a id='line_7526'>  The Fury bath'd them in each other's blood;</a>
<a id='line_7527'>  Then, having fix'd the fight, exulting flies,</a>
<a id='line_7528'>  And bears fulfill'd her promise to the skies.</a>
<a id='line_7529'>  To Juno thus she speaks: "Behold! It is done,</a>
<a id='line_7530'>  The blood already drawn, the war begun;</a>
<a id='line_7531'>  The discord is complete; nor can they cease</a>
<a id='line_7532'>  The dire debate, nor you command the peace.</a>
<a id='line_7533'>  Now, since the Latian and the Trojan brood</a>
<a id='line_7534'>  Have tasted vengeance and the sweets of blood;</a>
<a id='line_7535'>  Speak, and my pow'r shall add this office more:</a>
<a id='line_7536'>  The neighb'ing nations of th' Ausonian shore</a>
<a id='line_7537'>  Shall hear the dreadful rumor, from afar,</a>
<a id='line_7538'>  Of arm'd invasion, and embrace the war."</a>
<a id='line_7539'>  Then Juno thus: "The grateful work is done,</a>
<a id='line_7540'>  The seeds of discord sow'd, the war begun;</a>
<a id='line_7541'>  Frauds, fears, and fury have possess'd the state,</a>
<a id='line_7542'>  And fix'd the causes of a lasting hate.</a>
<a id='line_7543'>  A bloody Hymen shall th' alliance join</a>
<a id='line_7544'>  Betwixt the Trojan and Ausonian line:</a>
<a id='line_7545'>  But thou with speed to night and hell repair;</a>
<a id='line_7546'>  For not the gods, nor angry Jove, will bear</a>
<a id='line_7547'>  Thy lawless wand'ring walks in upper air.</a>
<a id='line_7548'>  Leave what remains to me." Saturnia said:</a>
<a id='line_7549'>  The sullen fiend her sounding wings display'd,</a>
<a id='line_7550'>  Unwilling left the light, and sought the nether shade.</a>
<a id='line_7551'></a>
<a id='line_7552'>  In midst of Italy, well known to fame,</a>
<a id='line_7553'>  There lies a lake (Amsanctus is the name)</a>
<a id='line_7554'>  Below the lofty mounts: on either side</a>
<a id='line_7555'>  Thick forests the forbidden entrance hide.</a>
<a id='line_7556'>  Full in the center of the sacred wood</a>
<a id='line_7557'>  An arm arises of the Stygian flood,</a>
<a id='line_7558'>  Which, breaking from beneath with bellowing sound,</a>
<a id='line_7559'>  Whirls the black waves and rattling stones around.</a>
<a id='line_7560'>  Here Pluto pants for breath from out his cell,</a>
<a id='line_7561'>  And opens wide the grinning jaws of hell.</a>
<a id='line_7562'>  To this infernal lake the Fury flies;</a>
<a id='line_7563'>  Here hides her hated head, and frees the lab'ring skies.</a>
<a id='line_7564'></a>
<a id='line_7565'>  Saturnian Juno now, with double care,</a>
<a id='line_7566'>  Attends the fatal process of the war.</a>
<a id='line_7567'>  The clowns, return'd, from battle bear the slain,</a>
<a id='line_7568'>  Implore the gods, and to their king complain.</a>
<a id='line_7569'>  The corps of Almon and the rest are shown;</a>
<a id='line_7570'>  Shrieks, clamors, murmurs, fill the frighted town.</a>
<a id='line_7571'>  Ambitious Turnus in the press appears,</a>
<a id='line_7572'>  And, aggravating crimes, augments their fears;</a>
<a id='line_7573'>  Proclaims his private injuries aloud,</a>
<a id='line_7574'>  A solemn promise made, and disavow'd;</a>
<a id='line_7575'>  A foreign son is sought, and a mix'd mungril brood.</a>
<a id='line_7576'>  Then they, whose mothers, frantic with their fear,</a>
<a id='line_7577'>  In woods and wilds the flags of Bacchus bear,</a>
<a id='line_7578'>  And lead his dances with dishevel'd hair,</a>
<a id='line_7579'>  Increase the clamor, and the war demand,</a>
<a id='line_7580'>  (Such was Amata's interest in the land,)</a>
<a id='line_7581'>  Against the public sanctions of the peace,</a>
<a id='line_7582'>  Against all omens of their ill success.</a>
<a id='line_7583'>  With fates averse, the rout in arms resort,</a>
<a id='line_7584'>  To force their monarch, and insult the court.</a>
<a id='line_7585'>  But, like a rock unmov'd, a rock that braves</a>
<a id='line_7586'>  The raging tempest and the rising waves-</a>
<a id='line_7587'>  Propp'd on himself he stands; his solid sides</a>
<a id='line_7588'>  Wash off the seaweeds, and the sounding tides-</a>
<a id='line_7589'>  So stood the pious prince, unmov'd, and long</a>
<a id='line_7590'>  Sustain'd the madness of the noisy throng.</a>
<a id='line_7591'>  But, when he found that Juno's pow'r prevail'd,</a>
<a id='line_7592'>  And all the methods of cool counsel fail'd,</a>
<a id='line_7593'>  He calls the gods to witness their offense,</a>
<a id='line_7594'>  Disclaims the war, asserts his innocence.</a>
<a id='line_7595'>  "Hurried by fate," he cries, "and borne before</a>
<a id='line_7596'>  A furious wind, we have the faithful shore.</a>
<a id='line_7597'>  O more than madmen! you yourselves shall bear</a>
<a id='line_7598'>  The guilt of blood and sacrilegious war:</a>
<a id='line_7599'>  Thou, Turnus, shalt atone it by thy fate,</a>
<a id='line_7600'>  And pray to Heav'n for peace, but pray too late.</a>
<a id='line_7601'>  For me, my stormy voyage at an end,</a>
<a id='line_7602'>  I to the port of death securely tend.</a>
<a id='line_7603'>  The fun'ral pomp which to your kings you pay,</a>
<a id='line_7604'>  Is all I want, and all you take away."</a>
<a id='line_7605'>  He said no more, but, in his walls confin'd,</a>
<a id='line_7606'>  Shut out the woes which he too well divin'd</a>
<a id='line_7607'>  Nor with the rising storm would vainly strive,</a>
<a id='line_7608'>  But left the helm, and let the vessel drive.</a>
<a id='line_7609'></a>
<a id='line_7610'>  A solemn custom was observ'd of old,</a>
<a id='line_7611'>  Which Latium held, and now the Romans hold,</a>
<a id='line_7612'>  Their standard when in fighting fields they rear</a>
<a id='line_7613'>  Against the fierce Hyrcanians, or declare</a>
<a id='line_7614'>  The Scythian, Indian, or Arabian war;</a>
<a id='line_7615'>  Or from the boasting Parthians would regain</a>
<a id='line_7616'>  Their eagles, lost in Carrhae's bloody plain.</a>
<a id='line_7617'>  Two gates of steel (the name of Mars they bear,</a>
<a id='line_7618'>  And still are worship'd with religious fear)</a>
<a id='line_7619'>  Before his temple stand: the dire abode,</a>
<a id='line_7620'>  And the fear'd issues of the furious god,</a>
<a id='line_7621'>  Are fenc'd with brazen bolts; without the gates,</a>
<a id='line_7622'>  The wary guardian Janus doubly waits.</a>
<a id='line_7623'>  Then, when the sacred senate votes the wars,</a>
<a id='line_7624'>  The Roman consul their decree declares,</a>
<a id='line_7625'>  And in his robes the sounding gates unbars.</a>
<a id='line_7626'>  The youth in military shouts arise,</a>
<a id='line_7627'>  And the loud trumpets break the yielding skies.</a>
<a id='line_7628'>  These rites, of old by sov'reign princes us'd,</a>
<a id='line_7629'>  Were the king's office; but the king refus'd,</a>
<a id='line_7630'>  Deaf to their cries, nor would the gates unbar</a>
<a id='line_7631'>  Of sacred peace, or loose th' imprison'd war;</a>
<a id='line_7632'>  But hid his head, and, safe from loud alarms,</a>
<a id='line_7633'>  Abhorr'd the wicked ministry of arms.</a>
<a id='line_7634'>  Then heav'n's imperious queen shot down from high:</a>
<a id='line_7635'>  At her approach the brazen hinges fly;</a>
<a id='line_7636'>  The gates are forc'd, and ev'ry falling bar;</a>
<a id='line_7637'>  And, like a tempest, issues out the war.</a>
<a id='line_7638'></a>
<a id='line_7639'>  The peaceful cities of th' Ausonian shore,</a>
<a id='line_7640'>  Lull'd in their ease, and undisturb'd before,</a>
<a id='line_7641'>  Are all on fire; and some, with studious care,</a>
<a id='line_7642'>  Their restiff steeds in sandy plains prepare;</a>
<a id='line_7643'>  Some their soft limbs in painful marches try,</a>
<a id='line_7644'>  And war is all their wish, and arms the gen'ral cry.</a>
<a id='line_7645'>  Part scour the rusty shields with seam; and part</a>
<a id='line_7646'>  New grind the blunted ax, and point the dart:</a>
<a id='line_7647'>  With joy they view the waving ensigns fly,</a>
<a id='line_7648'>  And hear the trumpet's clangor pierce the sky.</a>
<a id='line_7649'>  Five cities forge their arms: th' Atinian pow'rs,</a>
<a id='line_7650'>  Antemnae, Tibur with her lofty tow'rs,</a>
<a id='line_7651'>  Ardea the proud, the Crustumerian town:</a>
<a id='line_7652'>  All these of old were places of renown.</a>
<a id='line_7653'>  Some hammer helmets for the fighting field;</a>
<a id='line_7654'>  Some twine young sallows to support the shield;</a>
<a id='line_7655'>  The croslet some, and some the cuishes mold,</a>
<a id='line_7656'>  With silver plated, and with ductile gold.</a>
<a id='line_7657'>  The rustic honors of the scythe and share</a>
<a id='line_7658'>  Give place to swords and plumes, the pride of war.</a>
<a id='line_7659'>  Old fauchions are new temper'd in the fires;</a>
<a id='line_7660'>  The sounding trumpet ev'ry soul inspires.</a>
<a id='line_7661'>  The word is giv'n; with eager speed they lace</a>
<a id='line_7662'>  The shining headpiece, and the shield embrace.</a>
<a id='line_7663'>  The neighing steeds are to the chariot tied;</a>
<a id='line_7664'>  The trusty weapon sits on ev'ry side.</a>
<a id='line_7665'></a>
<a id='line_7666'>  And now the mighty labor is begun</a>
<a id='line_7667'>  Ye Muses, open all your Helicon.</a>
<a id='line_7668'>  Sing you the chiefs that sway'd th' Ausonian land,</a>
<a id='line_7669'>  Their arms, and armies under their command;</a>
<a id='line_7670'>  What warriors in our ancient clime were bred;</a>
<a id='line_7671'>  What soldiers follow'd, and what heroes led.</a>
<a id='line_7672'>  For well you know, and can record alone,</a>
<a id='line_7673'>  What fame to future times conveys but darkly down.</a>
<a id='line_7674'>  Mezentius first appear'd upon the plain:</a>
<a id='line_7675'>  Scorn sate upon his brows, and sour disdain,</a>
<a id='line_7676'>  Defying earth and heav'n. Etruria lost,</a>
<a id='line_7677'>  He brings to Turnus' aid his baffled host.</a>
<a id='line_7678'>  The charming Lausus, full of youthful fire,</a>
<a id='line_7679'>  Rode in the rank, and next his sullen sire;</a>
<a id='line_7680'>  To Turnus only second in the grace</a>
<a id='line_7681'>  Of manly mien, and features of the face.</a>
<a id='line_7682'>  A skilful horseman, and a huntsman bred,</a>
<a id='line_7683'>  With fates averse a thousand men he led:</a>
<a id='line_7684'>  His sire unworthy of so brave a son;</a>
<a id='line_7685'>  Himself well worthy of a happier throne.</a>
<a id='line_7686'></a>
<a id='line_7687'>  Next Aventinus drives his chariot round</a>
<a id='line_7688'>  The Latian plains, with palms and laurels crown'd.</a>
<a id='line_7689'>  Proud of his steeds, he smokes along the field;</a>
<a id='line_7690'>  His father's hydra fills his ample shield:</a>
<a id='line_7691'>  A hundred serpents hiss about the brims;</a>
<a id='line_7692'>  The son of Hercules he justly seems</a>
<a id='line_7693'>  By his broad shoulders and gigantic limbs;</a>
<a id='line_7694'>  Of heav'nly part, and part of earthly blood,</a>
<a id='line_7695'>  A mortal woman mixing with a god.</a>
<a id='line_7696'>  For strong Alcides, after he had slain</a>
<a id='line_7697'>  The triple Geryon, drove from conquer'd Spain</a>
<a id='line_7698'>  His captive herds; and, thence in triumph led,</a>
<a id='line_7699'>  On Tuscan Tiber's flow'ry banks they fed.</a>
<a id='line_7700'>  Then on Mount Aventine the son of Jove</a>
<a id='line_7701'>  The priestess Rhea found, and forc'd to love.</a>
<a id='line_7702'>  For arms, his men long piles and jav'lins bore;</a>
<a id='line_7703'>  And poles with pointed steel their foes in battle gore.</a>
<a id='line_7704'>  Like Hercules himself his son appears,</a>
<a id='line_7705'>  In salvage pomp; a lion's hide he wears;</a>
<a id='line_7706'>  About his shoulders hangs the shaggy skin;</a>
<a id='line_7707'>  The teeth and gaping jaws severely grin.</a>
<a id='line_7708'>  Thus, like the god his father, homely dress'd,</a>
<a id='line_7709'>  He strides into the hall, a horrid guest.</a>
<a id='line_7710'></a>
<a id='line_7711'>  Then two twin brothers from fair Tibur came,</a>
<a id='line_7712'>  (Which from their brother Tiburs took the name,)</a>
<a id='line_7713'>  Fierce Coras and Catillus, void of fear:</a>
<a id='line_7714'>  Arm'd Argive horse they led, and in the front appear.</a>
<a id='line_7715'>  Like cloud-born Centaurs, from the mountain's height</a>
<a id='line_7716'>  With rapid course descending to the fight;</a>
<a id='line_7717'>  They rush along; the rattling woods give way;</a>
<a id='line_7718'>  The branches bend before their sweepy sway.</a>
<a id='line_7719'></a>
<a id='line_7720'>  Nor was Praeneste's founder wanting there,</a>
<a id='line_7721'>  Whom fame reports the son of Mulciber:</a>
<a id='line_7722'>  Found in the fire, and foster'd in the plains,</a>
<a id='line_7723'>  A shepherd and a king at once he reigns,</a>
<a id='line_7724'>  And leads to Turnus' aid his country swains.</a>
<a id='line_7725'>  His own Praeneste sends a chosen band,</a>
<a id='line_7726'>  With those who plow Saturnia's Gabine land;</a>
<a id='line_7727'>  Besides the succor which cold Anien yields,</a>
<a id='line_7728'>  The rocks of Hernicus, and dewy fields,</a>
<a id='line_7729'>  Anagnia fat, and Father Amasene-</a>
<a id='line_7730'>  A num'rous rout, but all of naked men:</a>
<a id='line_7731'>  Nor arms they wear, nor swords and bucklers wield,</a>
<a id='line_7732'>  Nor drive the chariot thro' the dusty field,</a>
<a id='line_7733'>  But whirl from leathern slings huge balls of lead,</a>
<a id='line_7734'>  And spoils of yellow wolves adorn their head;</a>
<a id='line_7735'>  The left foot naked, when they march to fight,</a>
<a id='line_7736'>  But in a bull's raw hide they sheathe the right.</a>
<a id='line_7737'>  Messapus next, (great Neptune was his sire,)</a>
<a id='line_7738'>  Secure of steel, and fated from the fire,</a>
<a id='line_7739'>  In pomp appears, and with his ardor warms</a>
<a id='line_7740'>  A heartless train, unexercis'd in arms:</a>
<a id='line_7741'>  The just Faliscans he to battle brings,</a>
<a id='line_7742'>  And those who live where Lake Ciminia springs;</a>
<a id='line_7743'>  And where Feronia's grove and temple stands,</a>
<a id='line_7744'>  Who till Fescennian or Flavinian lands.</a>
<a id='line_7745'>  All these in order march, and marching sing</a>
<a id='line_7746'>  The warlike actions of their sea-born king;</a>
<a id='line_7747'>  Like a long team of snowy swans on high,</a>
<a id='line_7748'>  Which clap their wings, and cleave the liquid sky,</a>
<a id='line_7749'>  When, homeward from their wat'ry pastures borne,</a>
<a id='line_7750'>  They sing, and Asia's lakes their notes return.</a>
<a id='line_7751'>  Not one who heard their music from afar,</a>
<a id='line_7752'>  Would think these troops an army train'd to war,</a>
<a id='line_7753'>  But flocks of fowl, that, when the tempests roar,</a>
<a id='line_7754'>  With their hoarse gabbling seek the silent shore.</a>
<a id='line_7755'></a>
<a id='line_7756'>  Then Clausus came, who led a num'rous band</a>
<a id='line_7757'>  Of troops embodied from the Sabine land,</a>
<a id='line_7758'>  And, in himself alone, an army brought.</a>
<a id='line_7759'>  'T was he, the noble Claudian race begot,</a>
<a id='line_7760'>  The Claudian race, ordain'd, in times to come,</a>
<a id='line_7761'>  To share the greatness of imperial Rome.</a>
<a id='line_7762'>  He led the Cures forth, of old renown,</a>
<a id='line_7763'>  Mutuscans from their olive-bearing town,</a>
<a id='line_7764'>  And all th' Eretian pow'rs; besides a band</a>
<a id='line_7765'>  That follow'd from Velinum's dewy land,</a>
<a id='line_7766'>  And Amiternian troops, of mighty fame,</a>
<a id='line_7767'>  And mountaineers, that from Severus came,</a>
<a id='line_7768'>  And from the craggy cliffs of Tetrica,</a>
<a id='line_7769'>  And those where yellow Tiber takes his way,</a>
<a id='line_7770'>  And where Himella's wanton waters play.</a>
<a id='line_7771'>  Casperia sends her arms, with those that lie</a>
<a id='line_7772'>  By Fabaris, and fruitful Foruli:</a>
<a id='line_7773'>  The warlike aids of Horta next appear,</a>
<a id='line_7774'>  And the cold Nursians come to close the rear,</a>
<a id='line_7775'>  Mix'd with the natives born of Latine blood,</a>
<a id='line_7776'>  Whom Allia washes with her fatal flood.</a>
<a id='line_7777'>  Not thicker billows beat the Libyan main,</a>
<a id='line_7778'>  When pale Orion sets in wintry rain;</a>
<a id='line_7779'>  Nor thicker harvests on rich Hermus rise,</a>
<a id='line_7780'>  Or Lycian fields, when Phoebus burns the skies,</a>
<a id='line_7781'>  Than stand these troops: their bucklers ring around;</a>
<a id='line_7782'>  Their trampling turns the turf, and shakes the solid ground.</a>
<a id='line_7783'></a>
<a id='line_7784'>  High in his chariot then Halesus came,</a>
<a id='line_7785'>  A foe by birth to Troy's unhappy name:</a>
<a id='line_7786'>  From Agamemnon born- to Turnus' aid</a>
<a id='line_7787'>  A thousand men the youthful hero led,</a>
<a id='line_7788'>  Who till the Massic soil, for wine renown'd,</a>
<a id='line_7789'>  And fierce Auruncans from their hilly ground,</a>
<a id='line_7790'>  And those who live by Sidicinian shores,</a>
<a id='line_7791'>  And where with shoaly fords Vulturnus roars,</a>
<a id='line_7792'>  Cales' and Osca's old inhabitants,</a>
<a id='line_7793'>  And rough Saticulans, inur'd to wants:</a>
<a id='line_7794'>  Light demi-lances from afar they throw,</a>
<a id='line_7795'>  Fasten'd with leathern thongs, to gall the foe.</a>
<a id='line_7796'>  Short crooked swords in closer fight they wear;</a>
<a id='line_7797'>  And on their warding arm light bucklers bear.</a>
<a id='line_7798'></a>
<a id='line_7799'>  Nor Oebalus, shalt thou be left unsung,</a>
<a id='line_7800'>  From nymph Semethis and old Telon sprung,</a>
<a id='line_7801'>  Who then in Teleboan Capri reign'd;</a>
<a id='line_7802'>  But that short isle th' ambitious youth disdain'd,</a>
<a id='line_7803'>  And o'er Campania stretch'd his ample sway,</a>
<a id='line_7804'>  Where swelling Sarnus seeks the Tyrrhene sea;</a>
<a id='line_7805'>  O'er Batulum, and where Abella sees,</a>
<a id='line_7806'>  From her high tow'rs, the harvest of her trees.</a>
<a id='line_7807'>  And these (as was the Teuton use of old)</a>
<a id='line_7808'>  Wield brazen swords, and brazen bucklers hold;</a>
<a id='line_7809'>  Sling weighty stones, when from afar they fight;</a>
<a id='line_7810'>  Their casques are cork, a covering thick and light.</a>
<a id='line_7811'></a>
<a id='line_7812'>  Next these in rank, the warlike Ufens went,</a>
<a id='line_7813'>  And led the mountain troops that Nursia sent.</a>
<a id='line_7814'>  The rude Equicolae his rule obey'd;</a>
<a id='line_7815'>  Hunting their sport, and plund'ring was their trade.</a>
<a id='line_7816'>  In arms they plow'd, to battle still prepar'd:</a>
<a id='line_7817'>  Their soil was barren, and their hearts were hard.</a>
<a id='line_7818'></a>
<a id='line_7819'>  Umbro the priest the proud Marrubians led,</a>
<a id='line_7820'>  By King Archippus sent to Turnus' aid,</a>
<a id='line_7821'>  And peaceful olives crown'd his hoary head.</a>
<a id='line_7822'>  His wand and holy words, the viper's rage,</a>
<a id='line_7823'>  And venom'd wounds of serpents could assuage.</a>
<a id='line_7824'>  He, when he pleas'd with powerful juice to steep</a>
<a id='line_7825'>  Their temples, shut their eyes in pleasing sleep.</a>
<a id='line_7826'>  But vain were Marsian herbs, and magic art,</a>
<a id='line_7827'>  To cure the wound giv'n by the Dardan dart:</a>
<a id='line_7828'>  Yet his untimely fate th' Angitian woods</a>
<a id='line_7829'>  In sighs remurmur'd to the Fucine floods.</a>
<a id='line_7830'></a>
<a id='line_7831'>  The son of fam'd Hippolytus was there,</a>
<a id='line_7832'>  Fam'd as his sire, and, as his mother, fair;</a>
<a id='line_7833'>  Whom in Egerian groves Aricia bore,</a>
<a id='line_7834'>  And nurs'd his youth along the marshy shore,</a>
<a id='line_7835'>  Where great Diana's peaceful altars flame,</a>
<a id='line_7836'>  In fruitful fields; and Virbius was his name.</a>
<a id='line_7837'>  Hippolytus, as old records have said,</a>
<a id='line_7838'>  Was by his stepdam sought to share her bed;</a>
<a id='line_7839'>  But, when no female arts his mind could move,</a>
<a id='line_7840'>  She turn'd to furious hate her impious love.</a>
<a id='line_7841'>  Torn by wild horses on the sandy shore,</a>
<a id='line_7842'>  Another's crimes th' unhappy hunter bore,</a>
<a id='line_7843'>  Glutting his father's eyes with guiltless gore.</a>
<a id='line_7844'>  But chaste Diana, who his death deplor'd,</a>
<a id='line_7845'>  With Aesculapian herbs his life restor'd.</a>
<a id='line_7846'>  Then Jove, who saw from high, with just disdain,</a>
<a id='line_7847'>  The dead inspir'd with vital breath again,</a>
<a id='line_7848'>  Struck to the center, with his flaming dart,</a>
<a id='line_7849'>  Th' unhappy founder of the godlike art.</a>
<a id='line_7850'>  But Trivia kept in secret shades alone</a>
<a id='line_7851'>  Her care, Hippolytus, to fate unknown;</a>
<a id='line_7852'>  And call'd him Virbius in th' Egerian grove,</a>
<a id='line_7853'>  Where then he liv'd obscure, but safe from Jove.</a>
<a id='line_7854'>  For this, from Trivia's temple and her wood</a>
<a id='line_7855'>  Are coursers driv'n, who shed their master's blood,</a>
<a id='line_7856'>  Affrighted by the monsters of the flood.</a>
<a id='line_7857'>  His son, the second Virbius, yet retain'd</a>
<a id='line_7858'>  His father's art, and warrior steeds he rein'd.</a>
<a id='line_7859'></a>
<a id='line_7860'>  Amid the troops, and like the leading god,</a>
<a id='line_7861'>  High o'er the rest in arms the graceful Turnus rode:</a>
<a id='line_7862'>  A triple of plumes his crest adorn'd,</a>
<a id='line_7863'>  On which with belching flames Chimaera burn'd:</a>
<a id='line_7864'>  The more the kindled combat rises high'r,</a>
<a id='line_7865'>  The more with fury burns the blazing fire.</a>
<a id='line_7866'>  Fair Io grac'd his shield; but Io now</a>
<a id='line_7867'>  With horns exalted stands, and seems to low-</a>
<a id='line_7868'>  A noble charge! Her keeper by her side,</a>
<a id='line_7869'>  To watch her walks, his hundred eyes applied;</a>
<a id='line_7870'>  And on the brims her sire, the wat'ry god,</a>
<a id='line_7871'>  Roll'd from a silver urn his crystal flood.</a>
<a id='line_7872'>  A cloud of foot succeeds, and fills the fields</a>
<a id='line_7873'>  With swords, and pointed spears, and clatt'ring shields;</a>
<a id='line_7874'>  Of Argives, and of old Sicanian bands,</a>
<a id='line_7875'>  And those who plow the rich Rutulian lands;</a>
<a id='line_7876'>  Auruncan youth, and those Sacrana yields,</a>
<a id='line_7877'>  And the proud Labicans, with painted shields,</a>
<a id='line_7878'>  And those who near Numician streams reside,</a>
<a id='line_7879'>  And those whom Tiber's holy forests hide,</a>
<a id='line_7880'>  Or Circe's hills from the main land divide;</a>
<a id='line_7881'>  Where Ufens glides along the lowly lands,</a>
<a id='line_7882'>  Or the black water of Pomptina stands.</a>
<a id='line_7883'></a>
<a id='line_7884'>  Last, from the Volscians fair Camilla came,</a>
<a id='line_7885'>  And led her warlike troops, a warrior dame;</a>
<a id='line_7886'>  Unbred to spinning, in the loom unskill'd,</a>
<a id='line_7887'>  She chose the nobler Pallas of the field.</a>
<a id='line_7888'>  Mix'd with the first, the fierce virago fought,</a>

<a id='line_7890'>  Outstripp'd the winds in speed upon the plain,</a>
<a id='line_7891'>  Flew o'er the fields, nor hurt the bearded grain:</a>
<a id='line_7892'>  She swept the seas, and, as she skimm'd along,</a>
<a id='line_7893'>  Her flying feet unbath'd on billows hung.</a>
<a id='line_7894'>  Men, boys, and women, stupid with surprise,</a>
<a id='line_7895'>  Where'er she passes, fix their wond'ring eyes:</a>
<a id='line_7896'>  Longing they look, and, gaping at the sight,</a>
<a id='line_7897'>  Devour her o'er and o'er with vast delight;</a>
<a id='line_7898'>  Her purple habit sits with such a grace</a>
<a id='line_7899'>  On her smooth shoulders, and so suits her face;</a>

<a id='line_7924'>  Declare the common danger, and inform</a>

<a id='line_7936'></a>
<a id='line_7937'>  While Turnus and th' allies thus urge the war,</a>
<a id='line_7938'>  The Trojan, floating in a flood of care,</a>

<a id='line_7987'>  These make thy friends, and on their aid rely.</a>
<a id='line_7988'>  To thy free passage I submit my streams.</a>
<a id='line_7989'>  Wake, son of Venus, from thy pleasing dreams;</a>
<a id='line_7990'>  And, when the setting stars are lost in day,</a>
<a id='line_7991'>  To Juno's pow'r thy just devotion pay;</a>
<a id='line_7992'>  With sacrifice the wrathful queen appease:</a>
<a id='line_7993'>  Her pride at length shall fall, her fury cease.</a>
<a id='line_7994'>  When thou return'st victorious from the war,</a>
<a id='line_7995'>  Perform thy vows to me with grateful care.</a>
<a id='line_7996'>  The god am I, whose yellow water flows</a>
<a id='line_7997'>  Around these fields, and fattens as it goes:</a>
<a id='line_7998'>  Tiber my name; among the rolling floods</a>
<a id='line_7999'>  Renown'd on earth, esteem'd among the gods.</a>
<a id='line_8000'>  This is my certain seat. In times to come,</a>
<a id='line_8001'>  My waves shall wash the walls of mighty Rome."</a>
<a id='line_8002'></a>
<a id='line_8003'>  He said, and plung'd below. While yet he spoke,</a>
<a id='line_8004'>  His dream Aeneas and his sleep forsook.</a>
<a id='line_8005'>  He rose, and looking up, beheld the skies</a>
<a id='line_8006'>  With purple blushing, and the day arise.</a>
<a id='line_8007'>  Then water in his hollow palm he took</a>
<a id='line_8008'>  From Tiber's flood, and thus the pow'rs bespoke:</a>
<a id='line_8009'>  "Laurentian nymphs, by whom the streams are fed,</a>
<a id='line_8010'>  And Father Tiber, in thy sacred bed</a>
<a id='line_8011'>  Receive Aeneas, and from danger keep.</a>
<a id='line_8012'>  Whatever fount, whatever holy deep,</a>
<a id='line_8013'>  Conceals thy wat'ry stores; where'er they rise,</a>
<a id='line_8014'>  And, bubbling from below, salute the skies;</a>
<a id='line_8015'>  Thou, king of horned floods, whose plenteous urn</a>
<a id='line_8016'>  Suffices fatness to the fruitful corn,</a>
<a id='line_8017'>  For this thy kind compassion of our woes,</a>
<a id='line_8018'>  Shalt share my morning song and ev'ning vows.</a>
<a id='line_8019'>  But, O be present to thy people's aid,</a>
<a id='line_8020'>  And firm the gracious promise thou hast made!"</a>
<a id='line_8021'>  Thus having said, two galleys from his stores,</a>
<a id='line_8022'>  With care he chooses, mans, and fits with oars.</a>
<a id='line_8023'>  Now on the shore the fatal swine is found.</a>
<a id='line_8024'>  Wondrous to tell!- She lay along the ground:</a>
<a id='line_8025'>  Her well-fed offspring at her udders hung;</a>
<a id='line_8026'>  She white herself, and white her thirty young.</a>
<a id='line_8027'>  Aeneas takes the mother and her brood,</a>
<a id='line_8028'>  And all on Juno's altar are bestow'd.</a>
<a id='line_8029'></a>
<a id='line_8030'>  The foll'wing night, and the succeeding day,</a>
<a id='line_8031'>  Propitious Tiber smooth'd his wat'ry way:</a>
<a id='line_8032'>  He roll'd his river back, and pois'd he stood,</a>
<a id='line_8033'>  A gentle swelling, and a peaceful flood.</a>
<a id='line_8034'>  The Trojans mount their ships; they put from shore,</a>
<a id='line_8035'>  Borne on the waves, and scarcely dip an oar.</a>
<a id='line_8036'>  Shouts from the land give omen to their course,</a>
<a id='line_8037'>  And the pitch'd vessels glide with easy force.</a>
<a id='line_8038'>  The woods and waters wonder at the gleam</a>
<a id='line_8039'>  Of shields, and painted ships that stem the stream.</a>
<a id='line_8040'>  One summer's night and one whole day they pass</a>
<a id='line_8041'>  Betwixt the greenwood shades, and cut the liquid glass.</a>
<a id='line_8042'>  The fiery sun had finish'd half his race,</a>
<a id='line_8043'>  Look'd back, and doubted in the middle space,</a>
<a id='line_8044'>  When they from far beheld the rising tow'rs,</a>
<a id='line_8045'>  The tops of sheds, and shepherds' lowly bow'rs,</a>
<a id='line_8046'>  Thin as they stood, which, then of homely clay,</a>
<a id='line_8047'>  Now rise in marble, from the Roman sway.</a>
<a id='line_8048'>  These cots (Evander's kingdom, mean and poor)</a>
<a id='line_8049'>  The Trojan saw, and turn'd his ships to shore.</a>
<a id='line_8050'>  'T was on a solemn day: th' Arcadian states,</a>
<a id='line_8051'>  The king and prince, without the city gates,</a>
<a id='line_8052'>  Then paid their off'rings in a sacred grove</a>
<a id='line_8053'>  To Hercules, the warrior son of Jove.</a>
<a id='line_8054'>  Thick clouds of rolling smoke involve the skies,</a>
<a id='line_8055'>  And fat of entrails on his altar fries.</a>
<a id='line_8056'></a>
<a id='line_8057'>  But, when they saw the ships that stemm'd the flood,</a>
<a id='line_8058'>  And glitter'd thro' the covert of the wood,</a>
<a id='line_8059'>  They rose with fear, and left th' unfinish'd feast,</a>
<a id='line_8060'>  Till dauntless Pallas reassur'd the rest</a>
<a id='line_8061'>  To pay the rites. Himself without delay</a>
<a id='line_8062'>  A jav'lin seiz'd, and singly took his way;</a>
<a id='line_8063'>  Then gain'd a rising ground, and call'd from far:</a>
<a id='line_8064'>  "Resolve me, strangers, whence, and what you are;</a>
<a id='line_8065'>  Your bus'ness here; and bring you peace or war?"</a>
<a id='line_8066'>  High on the stern Aeneas his stand,</a>
<a id='line_8067'>  And held a branch of olive in his hand,</a>
<a id='line_8068'>  While thus he spoke: "The Phrygians' arms you see,</a>
<a id='line_8069'>  Expell'd from Troy, provok'd in Italy</a>
<a id='line_8070'>  By Latian foes, with war unjustly made;</a>
<a id='line_8071'>  At first affianc'd, and at last betray'd.</a>
<a id='line_8072'>  This message bear: 'The Trojans and their chief</a>
<a id='line_8073'>  Bring holy peace, and beg the king's relief.'</a>
<a id='line_8074'>  Struck with so great a name, and all on fire,</a>
<a id='line_8075'>  The youth replies: "Whatever you require,</a>
<a id='line_8076'>  Your fame exacts. Upon our shores descend.</a>
<a id='line_8077'>  A welcome guest, and, what you wish, a friend."</a>
<a id='line_8078'>  He said, and, downward hasting to the strand,</a>
<a id='line_8079'>  Embrac'd the stranger prince, and join'd his hand.</a>
<a id='line_8080'></a>
<a id='line_8081'>  Conducted to the grove, Aeneas broke</a>
<a id='line_8082'>  The silence first, and thus the king bespoke:</a>
<a id='line_8083'>  "Best of the Greeks, to whom, by fate's command,</a>
<a id='line_8084'>  I bear these peaceful branches in my hand,</a>
<a id='line_8085'>  Undaunted I approach you, tho' I know</a>
<a id='line_8086'>  Your birth is Grecian, and your land my foe;</a>
<a id='line_8087'>  From Atreus tho' your ancient lineage came,</a>
<a id='line_8088'>  And both the brother kings your kindred claim;</a>
<a id='line_8089'>  Yet, my self-conscious worth, your high renown,</a>
<a id='line_8090'>  Your virtue, thro' the neighb'ring nations blown,</a>
<a id='line_8091'>  Our fathers' mingled blood, Apollo's voice,</a>
<a id='line_8092'>  Have led me hither, less by need than choice.</a>
<a id='line_8093'>  Our founder Dardanus, as fame has sung,</a>
<a id='line_8094'>  And Greeks acknowledge, from Electra sprung:</a>
<a id='line_8095'>  Electra from the loins of Atlas came;</a>
<a id='line_8096'>  Atlas, whose head sustains the starry frame.</a>
<a id='line_8097'>  Your sire is Mercury, whom long before</a>
<a id='line_8098'>  On cold Cyllene's top fair Maia bore.</a>
<a id='line_8099'>  Maia the fair, on fame if we rely,</a>
<a id='line_8100'>  Was Atlas' daughter, who sustains the sky.</a>
<a id='line_8101'>  Thus from one common source our streams divide;</a>
<a id='line_8102'>  Ours is the Trojan, yours th' Arcadian side.</a>
<a id='line_8103'>  Rais'd by these hopes, I sent no news before,</a>
<a id='line_8104'>  Nor ask'd your leave, nor did your faith implore;</a>
<a id='line_8105'>  But come, without a pledge, my own ambassador.</a>
<a id='line_8106'>  The same Rutulians, who with arms pursue</a>
<a id='line_8107'>  The Trojan race, are equal foes to you.</a>
<a id='line_8108'>  Our host expell'd, what farther force can stay</a>
<a id='line_8109'>  The victor troops from universal sway?</a>
<a id='line_8110'>  Then will they stretch their pow'r athwart the land,</a>
<a id='line_8111'>  And either sea from side to side command.</a>
<a id='line_8112'>  Receive our offer'd faith, and give us thine;</a>
<a id='line_8113'>  Ours is a gen'rous and experienc'd line:</a>
<a id='line_8114'>  We want not hearts nor bodies for the war;</a>
<a id='line_8115'>  In council cautious, and in fields we dare."</a>
<a id='line_8116'></a>
<a id='line_8117'>  He said; and while spoke, with piercing eyes</a>
<a id='line_8118'>  Evander view'd the man with vast surprise,</a>
<a id='line_8119'>  Pleas'd with his action, ravish'd with his face:</a>
<a id='line_8120'>  Then answer'd briefly, with a royal grace:</a>
<a id='line_8121'>  "O valiant leader of the Trojan line,</a>
<a id='line_8122'>  In whom the features of thy father shine,</a>
<a id='line_8123'>  How I recall Anchises! how I see</a>
<a id='line_8124'>  His motions, mien, and all my friend, in thee!</a>
<a id='line_8125'>  Long tho' it be, 't is fresh within my mind,</a>
<a id='line_8126'>  When Priam to his sister's court design'd</a>
<a id='line_8127'>  A welcome visit, with a friendly stay,</a>
<a id='line_8128'>  And thro' th' Arcadian kingdom took his way.</a>
<a id='line_8129'>  Then, past a boy, the callow down began</a>
<a id='line_8130'>  To shade my chin, and call me first a man.</a>
<a id='line_8131'>  I saw the shining train with vast delight,</a>
<a id='line_8132'>  And Priam's goodly person pleas'd my sight:</a>
<a id='line_8133'>  But great Anchises, far above the rest,</a>
<a id='line_8134'>  With awful wonder fir'd my youthful breast.</a>
<a id='line_8135'>  I long'd to join in friendship's holy bands</a>
<a id='line_8136'>  Our mutual hearts, and plight our mutual hands.</a>
<a id='line_8137'>  I first accosted him: I sued, I sought,</a>
<a id='line_8138'>  And, with a loving force, to Pheneus brought.</a>
<a id='line_8139'>  He gave me, when at length constrain'd to go,</a>
<a id='line_8140'>  A Lycian quiver and a Gnossian bow,</a>
<a id='line_8141'>  A vest embroider'd, glorious to behold,</a>
<a id='line_8142'>  And two rich bridles, with their bits of gold,</a>
<a id='line_8143'>  Which my son's coursers in obedience hold.</a>
<a id='line_8144'>  The league you ask, I offer, as your right;</a>
<a id='line_8145'>  And, when to-morrow's sun reveals the light,</a>
<a id='line_8146'>  With swift supplies you shall be sent away.</a>
<a id='line_8147'>  Now celebrate with us this solemn day,</a>
<a id='line_8148'>  Whose holy rites admit no long delay.</a>
<a id='line_8149'>  Honor our annual feast; and take your seat,</a>
<a id='line_8150'>  With friendly welcome, at a homely treat."</a>
<a id='line_8151'>  Thus having said, the bowls (remov'd for fear)</a>
<a id='line_8152'>  The youths replac'd, and soon restor'd the cheer.</a>
<a id='line_8153'>  On sods of turf he set the soldiers round:</a>
<a id='line_8154'>  A maple throne, rais'd higher from the ground,</a>
<a id='line_8155'>  Receiv'd the Trojan chief; and, o'er the bed,</a>
<a id='line_8156'>  A lion's shaggy hide for ornament they spread.</a>
<a id='line_8157'>  The loaves were serv'd in canisters; the wine</a>
<a id='line_8158'>  In bowls; the priest renew'd the rites divine:</a>
<a id='line_8159'>  Broil'd entrails are their food, and beef's continued chine.</a>
<a id='line_8160'></a>
<a id='line_8161'>  But when the rage of hunger was repress'd,</a>
<a id='line_8162'>  Thus spoke Evander to his royal guest:</a>
<a id='line_8163'>  "These rites, these altars, and this feast, O king,</a>
<a id='line_8164'>  From no vain fears or superstition spring,</a>
<a id='line_8165'>  Or blind devotion, or from blinder chance,</a>
<a id='line_8166'>  Or heady zeal, or brutal ignorance;</a>
<a id='line_8167'>  But, sav'd from danger, with a grateful sense,</a>
<a id='line_8168'>  The labors of a god we recompense.</a>
<a id='line_8169'>  See, from afar, yon rock that mates the sky,</a>
<a id='line_8170'>  About whose feet such heaps of rubbish lie;</a>
<a id='line_8171'>  Such indigested ruin; bleak and bare,</a>
<a id='line_8172'>  How desart now it stands, expos'd in air!</a>
<a id='line_8173'>  'T was once a robber's den, inclos'd around</a>
<a id='line_8174'>  With living stone, and deep beneath the ground.</a>
<a id='line_8175'>  The monster Cacus, more than half a beast,</a>
<a id='line_8176'>  This hold, impervious to the sun, possess'd.</a>
<a id='line_8177'>  The pavement ever foul with human gore;</a>
<a id='line_8178'>  Heads, and their mangled members, hung the door.</a>
<a id='line_8179'>  Vulcan this plague begot; and, like his sire,</a>
<a id='line_8180'>  Black clouds he belch'd, and flakes of livid fire.</a>
<a id='line_8181'>  Time, long expected, eas'd us of our load,</a>
<a id='line_8182'>  And brought the needful presence of a god.</a>
<a id='line_8183'>  Th' avenging force of Hercules, from Spain,</a>
<a id='line_8184'>  Arriv'd in triumph, from Geryon slain:</a>
<a id='line_8185'>  Thrice liv'd the giant, and thrice liv'd in vain.</a>
<a id='line_8186'>  His prize, the lowing herds, Alcides drove</a>
<a id='line_8187'>  Near Tiber's bank, to graze the shady grove.</a>
<a id='line_8188'>  Allur'd with hope of plunder, and intent</a>
<a id='line_8189'>  By force to rob, by fraud to circumvent,</a>
<a id='line_8190'>  The brutal Cacus, as by chance they stray'd,</a>
<a id='line_8191'>  Four oxen thence, and four fair kine convey'd;</a>
<a id='line_8192'>  And, lest the printed footsteps might be seen,</a>
<a id='line_8193'>  He dragg'd 'em backwards to his rocky den.</a>
<a id='line_8194'>  The tracks averse a lying notice gave,</a>
<a id='line_8195'>  And led the searcher backward from the cave.</a>
<a id='line_8196'></a>
<a id='line_8197'>  "Meantime the herdsman hero shifts his place,</a>
<a id='line_8198'>  To find fresh pasture and untrodden grass.</a>
<a id='line_8199'>  The beasts, who miss'd their mates, fill'd all around</a>
<a id='line_8200'>  With bellowings, and the rocks restor'd the sound.</a>
<a id='line_8201'>  One heifer, who had heard her love complain,</a>
<a id='line_8202'>  Roar'd from the cave, and made the project vain.</a>
<a id='line_8203'>  Alcides found the fraud; with rage he shook,</a>
<a id='line_8204'>  And toss'd about his head his knotted oak.</a>
<a id='line_8205'>  Swift as the winds, or Scythian arrows' flight,</a>
<a id='line_8206'>  He clomb, with eager haste, th' aerial height.</a>
<a id='line_8207'>  Then first we saw the monster mend his pace;</a>
<a id='line_8208'>  Fear his eyes, and paleness in his face,</a>
<a id='line_8209'>  Confess'd the god's approach. Trembling he springs,</a>
<a id='line_8210'>  As terror had increas'd his feet with wings;</a>
<a id='line_8211'>  Nor stay'd for stairs; but down the depth he threw</a>
<a id='line_8212'>  His body, on his back the door he drew</a>
<a id='line_8213'>  (The door, a rib of living rock; with pains</a>
<a id='line_8214'>  His father hew'd it out, and bound with iron chains):</a>
<a id='line_8215'>  He broke the heavy links, the mountain clos'd,</a>
<a id='line_8216'>  And bars and levers to his foe oppos'd.</a>
<a id='line_8217'>  The wretch had hardly made his dungeon fast;</a>
<a id='line_8218'>  The fierce avenger came with bounding haste;</a>
<a id='line_8219'>  Survey'd the mouth of the forbidden hold,</a>
<a id='line_8220'>  And here and there his raging eyes he roll'd.</a>
<a id='line_8221'>  He gnash'd his teeth; and thrice he compass'd round</a>
<a id='line_8222'>  With winged speed the circuit of the ground.</a>
<a id='line_8223'>  Thrice at the cavern's mouth he pull'd in vain,</a>
<a id='line_8224'>  And, panting, thrice desisted from his pain.</a>
<a id='line_8225'>  A pointed flinty rock, all bare and black,</a>
<a id='line_8226'>  Grew gibbous from behind the mountain's back;</a>
<a id='line_8227'>  Owls, ravens, all ill omens of the night,</a>
<a id='line_8228'>  Here built their nests, and hither wing'd their flight.</a>
<a id='line_8229'>  The leaning head hung threat'ning o'er the flood,</a>
<a id='line_8230'>  And nodded to the left. The hero stood</a>
<a id='line_8231'>  Adverse, with planted feet, and, from the right,</a>
<a id='line_8232'>  Tugg'd at the solid stone with all his might.</a>
<a id='line_8233'>  Thus heav'd, the fix'd foundations of the rock</a>
<a id='line_8234'>  Gave way; heav'n echo'd at the rattling shock.</a>
<a id='line_8235'>  Tumbling, it chok'd the flood: on either side</a>
<a id='line_8236'>  The banks leap backward, and the streams divide;</a>
<a id='line_8237'>  The sky shrunk upward with unusual dread,</a>
<a id='line_8238'>  And trembling Tiber div'd beneath his bed.</a>
<a id='line_8239'>  The court of Cacus stands reveal'd to sight;</a>
<a id='line_8240'>  The cavern glares with new-admitted light.</a>
<a id='line_8241'>  So the pent vapors, with a rumbling sound,</a>
<a id='line_8242'>  Heave from below, and rend the hollow ground;</a>
<a id='line_8243'>  A sounding flaw succeeds; and, from on high,</a>
<a id='line_8244'>  The gods with hate beheld the nether sky:</a>
<a id='line_8245'>  The ghosts repine at violated night,</a>
<a id='line_8246'>  And curse th' invading sun, and sicken at the sight.</a>
<a id='line_8247'>  The graceless monster, caught in open day,</a>
<a id='line_8248'>  Inclos'd, and in despair to fly away,</a>
<a id='line_8249'>  Howls horrible from underneath, and fills</a>
<a id='line_8250'>  His hollow palace with unmanly yells.</a>
<a id='line_8251'>  The hero stands above, and from afar</a>
<a id='line_8252'>  Plies him with darts, and stones, and distant war.</a>
<a id='line_8253'>  He, from his nostrils huge mouth, expires</a>
<a id='line_8254'>  Black clouds of smoke, amidst his father's fires,</a>
<a id='line_8255'>  Gath'ring, with each repeated blast, the night,</a>
<a id='line_8256'>  To make uncertain aim, and erring sight.</a>
<a id='line_8257'>  The wrathful god then plunges from above,</a>
<a id='line_8258'>  And, where in thickest waves the sparkles drove,</a>
<a id='line_8259'>  There lights; and wades thro' fumes, and gropes his way,</a>
<a id='line_8260'>  Half sing'd, half stifled, till he grasps his prey.</a>
<a id='line_8261'>  The monster, spewing fruitless flames, he found;</a>
<a id='line_8262'>  He squeez'd his throat; he writh'd his neck around,</a>
<a id='line_8263'>  And in a knot his crippled members bound;</a>
<a id='line_8264'>  Then from their sockets tore his burning eyes:</a>
<a id='line_8265'>  Roll'd on a heap, the breathless robber lies.</a>
<a id='line_8266'>  The doors, unbarr'd, receive the rushing day,</a>
<a id='line_8267'>  And thoro' lights disclose the ravish'd prey.</a>
<a id='line_8268'>  The bulls, redeem'd, breathe open air again.</a>
<a id='line_8269'>  Next, by the feet, they drag him from his den.</a>
<a id='line_8270'>  The wond'ring neighborhood, with glad surprise,</a>
<a id='line_8271'>  Behold his shagged breast, his giant size,</a>
<a id='line_8272'>  His mouth that flames no more, and his extinguish'd eyes.</a>
<a id='line_8273'>  From that auspicious day, with rites divine,</a>
<a id='line_8274'>  We worship at the hero's holy shrine.</a>
<a id='line_8275'>  Potitius first ordain'd these annual vows:</a>
<a id='line_8276'>  As priests, were added the Pinarian house,</a>
<a id='line_8277'>  Who rais'd this altar in the sacred shade,</a>
<a id='line_8278'>  Where honors, ever due, for ever shall be paid.</a>
<a id='line_8279'>  For these deserts, and this high virtue shown,</a>
<a id='line_8280'>  Ye warlike youths, your heads with garlands crown:</a>
<a id='line_8281'>  Fill high the goblets with a sparkling flood,</a>
<a id='line_8282'>  And with deep draughts invoke our common god."</a>
<a id='line_8283'></a>
<a id='line_8284'>  This said, a double wreath Evander twin'd,</a>
<a id='line_8285'>  And poplars black and white his temples bind.</a>
<a id='line_8286'>  Then brims his ample bowl. With like design</a>
<a id='line_8287'>  The rest invoke the gods, with sprinkled wine.</a>
<a id='line_8288'>  Meantime the sun descended from the skies,</a>
<a id='line_8289'>  And the bright evening star began to rise.</a>
<a id='line_8290'>  And now the priests, Potitius at their head,</a>
<a id='line_8291'>  In skins of beasts involv'd, the long procession led;</a>
<a id='line_8292'>  Held high the flaming tapers in their hands,</a>
<a id='line_8293'>  As custom had prescrib'd their holy bands;</a>
<a id='line_8294'>  Then with a second course the tables load,</a>
<a id='line_8295'>  And with full chargers offer to the god.</a>
<a id='line_8296'>  The Salii sing, and cense his altars round</a>
<a id='line_8297'>  With Saban smoke, their heads with poplar bound-</a>
<a id='line_8298'>  One choir of old, another of the young,</a>
<a id='line_8299'>  To dance, and bear the burthen of the song.</a>
<a id='line_8300'>  The lay records the labors, and the praise,</a>
<a id='line_8301'>  And all th' immortal acts of Hercules:</a>
<a id='line_8302'>  First, how the mighty babe, when swath'd in bands,</a>
<a id='line_8303'>  The serpents strangled with his infant hands;</a>
<a id='line_8304'>  Then, as in years and matchless force he grew,</a>
<a id='line_8305'>  Th' Oechalian walls, and Trojan, overthrew.</a>
<a id='line_8306'>  Besides, a thousand hazards they relate,</a>
<a id='line_8307'>  Procur'd by Juno's and Eurystheus' hate:</a>
<a id='line_8308'>  "Thy hands, unconquer'd hero, could subdue</a>
<a id='line_8309'>  The cloud-born Centaurs, and the monster crew:</a>
<a id='line_8310'>  Nor thy resistless arm the bull withstood,</a>
<a id='line_8311'>  Nor he, the roaring terror of the wood.</a>
<a id='line_8312'>  The triple porter of the Stygian seat,</a>
<a id='line_8313'>  With lolling tongue, lay fawning at thy feet,</a>
<a id='line_8314'>  And, seiz'd with fear, forgot his mangled meat.</a>
<a id='line_8315'>  Th' infernal waters trembled at thy sight;</a>
<a id='line_8316'>  Thee, god, no face of danger could affright;</a>
<a id='line_8317'>  Not huge Typhoeus, nor th' unnumber'd snake,</a>
<a id='line_8318'>  Increas'd with hissing heads, in Lerna's lake.</a>
<a id='line_8319'>  Hail, Jove's undoubted son! an added grace</a>
<a id='line_8320'>  To heav'n and the great author of thy race!</a>
<a id='line_8321'>  Receive the grateful off'rings which we pay,</a>
<a id='line_8322'>  And smile propitious on thy solemn day!"</a>
<a id='line_8323'>  In numbers thus they sung; above the rest,</a>
<a id='line_8324'>  The den and death of Cacus crown the feast.</a>
<a id='line_8325'>  The woods to hollow vales convey the sound,</a>
<a id='line_8326'>  The vales to hills, and hills the notes rebound.</a>
<a id='line_8327'>  The rites perform'd, the cheerful train retire.</a>
<a id='line_8328'></a>
<a id='line_8329'>  Betwixt young Pallas and his aged sire,</a>
<a id='line_8330'>  The Trojan pass'd, the city to survey,</a>
<a id='line_8331'>  And pleasing talk beguil'd the tedious way.</a>
<a id='line_8332'>  The stranger cast around his curious eyes,</a>
<a id='line_8333'>  New objects viewing still, with new surprise;</a>
<a id='line_8334'>  With greedy joy enquires of various things,</a>
<a id='line_8335'>  And acts and monuments of ancient kings.</a>
<a id='line_8336'>  Then thus the founder of the Roman tow'rs:</a>
<a id='line_8337'>  "These woods were first the seat of sylvan pow'rs,</a>
<a id='line_8338'>  Of Nymphs and Fauns, and salvage men, who took</a>
<a id='line_8339'>  Their birth from trunks of trees and stubborn oak.</a>
<a id='line_8340'>  Nor laws they knew, nor manners, nor the care</a>
<a id='line_8341'>  Of lab'ring oxen, or the shining share,</a>
<a id='line_8342'>  Nor arts of gain, nor what they gain'd to spare.</a>
<a id='line_8343'>  Their exercise the chase; the running flood</a>
<a id='line_8344'>  Supplied their thirst, the trees supplied their food.</a>
<a id='line_8345'>  Then Saturn came, who fled the pow'r of Jove,</a>
<a id='line_8346'>  Robb'd of his realms, and banish'd from above.</a>
<a id='line_8347'>  The men, dispers'd on hills, to towns he brought,</a>
<a id='line_8348'>  And laws ordain'd, and civil customs taught,</a>
<a id='line_8349'>  And Latium call'd the land where safe he lay</a>
<a id='line_8350'>  From his unduteous son, and his usurping sway.</a>
<a id='line_8351'>  With his mild empire, peace and plenty came;</a>
<a id='line_8352'>  And hence the golden times deriv'd their name.</a>
<a id='line_8353'>  A more degenerate and discolor'd age</a>
<a id='line_8354'>  Succeeded this, with avarice and rage.</a>
<a id='line_8355'>  Th' Ausonians then, and bold Sicanians came;</a>
<a id='line_8356'>  And Saturn's empire often chang'd the name.</a>
<a id='line_8357'>  Then kings, gigantic Tybris, and the rest,</a>
<a id='line_8358'>  With arbitrary sway the land oppress'd:</a>
<a id='line_8359'>  For Tiber's flood was Albula before,</a>
<a id='line_8360'>  Till, from the tyrant's fate, his name it bore.</a>
<a id='line_8361'>  I last arriv'd, driv'n from my native home</a>
<a id='line_8362'>  By fortune's pow'r, and fate's resistless doom.</a>
<a id='line_8363'>  Long toss'd on seas, I sought this happy land,</a>
<a id='line_8364'>  Warn'd by my mother nymph, and call'd by Heav'n's command."</a>
<a id='line_8365'></a>
<a id='line_8366'>  Thus, walking on, he spoke, and shew'd the gate,</a>
<a id='line_8367'>  Since call'd Carmental by the Roman state;</a>
<a id='line_8368'>  Where stood an altar, sacred to the name</a>
<a id='line_8369'>  Of old Carmenta, the prophetic dame,</a>
<a id='line_8370'>  Who to her son foretold th' Aenean race,</a>
<a id='line_8371'>  Sublime in fame, and Rome's imperial place:</a>
<a id='line_8372'>  Then shews the forest, which, in after times,</a>
<a id='line_8373'>  Fierce Romulus for perpetrated crimes</a>
<a id='line_8374'>  A sacred refuge made; with this, the shrine</a>
<a id='line_8375'>  Where Pan below the rock had rites divine:</a>
<a id='line_8376'>  Then tells of Argus' death, his murder'd guest,</a>
<a id='line_8377'>  Whose grave and tomb his innocence attest.</a>
<a id='line_8378'>  Thence, to the steep Tarpeian rock he leads;</a>
<a id='line_8379'>  Now roof'd with gold, then thatch'd with homely reeds.</a>
<a id='line_8380'>  A reverent fear (such superstition reigns</a>
<a id='line_8381'>  Among the rude) ev'n then possess'd the swains.</a>
<a id='line_8382'>  Some god, they knew- what god, they could not tell-</a>
<a id='line_8383'>  Did there amidst the sacred horror dwell.</a>
<a id='line_8384'>  Th' Arcadians thought him Jove; and said they saw</a>
<a id='line_8385'>  The mighty Thund'rer with majestic awe,</a>
<a id='line_8386'>  Who took his shield, and dealt his bolts around,</a>
<a id='line_8387'>  And scatter'd tempests on the teeming ground.</a>
<a id='line_8388'>  Then saw two heaps of ruins, (once they stood</a>
<a id='line_8389'>  Two stately towns, on either side the flood,)</a>
<a id='line_8390'>  Saturnia's and Janicula's remains;</a>
<a id='line_8391'>  And either place the founder's name retains.</a>
<a id='line_8392'>  Discoursing thus together, they resort</a>
<a id='line_8393'>  Where poor Evander kept his country court.</a>
<a id='line_8394'>  They view'd the ground of Rome's litigious hall;</a>
<a id='line_8395'>  (Once oxen low'd, where now the lawyers bawl;)</a>
<a id='line_8396'>  Then, stooping, thro' the narrow gate they press'd,</a>
<a id='line_8397'>  When thus the king bespoke his Trojan guest:</a>
<a id='line_8398'>  "Mean as it is, this palace, and this door,</a>
<a id='line_8399'>  Receiv'd Alcides, then a conqueror.</a>
<a id='line_8400'>  Dare to be poor; accept our homely food,</a>
<a id='line_8401'>  Which feasted him, and emulate a god."</a>
<a id='line_8402'>  Then underneath a lowly roof he led</a>
<a id='line_8403'>  The weary prince, and laid him on a bed;</a>
<a id='line_8404'>  The stuffing leaves, with hides of bears o'erspread.</a>
<a id='line_8405'>  Now Night had shed her silver dews around,</a>
<a id='line_8406'>  And with her sable wings embrac'd the ground,</a>
<a id='line_8407'>  When love's fair goddess, anxious for her son,</a>
<a id='line_8408'>  (New tumults rising, and new wars begun,)</a>
<a id='line_8409'>  Couch'd with her husband in his golden bed,</a>
<a id='line_8410'>  With these alluring words invokes his aid;</a>
<a id='line_8411'>  And, that her pleasing speech his mind may move,</a>
<a id='line_8412'>  Inspires each accent with the charms of love:</a>
<a id='line_8413'>  "While cruel fate conspir'd with Grecian pow'rs,</a>
<a id='line_8414'>  To level with the ground the Trojan tow'rs,</a>
<a id='line_8415'>  I ask'd not aid th' unhappy to restore,</a>
<a id='line_8416'>  Nor did the succor of thy skill implore;</a>
<a id='line_8417'>  Nor urg'd the labors of my lord in vain,</a>
<a id='line_8418'>  A sinking empire longer to sustain,</a>
<a id='line_8419'>  Tho'much I ow'd to Priam's house, and more</a>
<a id='line_8420'>  The dangers of Aeneas did deplore.</a>
<a id='line_8421'>  But now, by Jove's command, and fate's decree,</a>
<a id='line_8422'>  His race is doom'd to reign in Italy:</a>
<a id='line_8423'>  With humble suit I beg thy needful art,</a>
<a id='line_8424'>  O still propitious pow'r, that rules my heart!</a>
<a id='line_8425'>  A mother kneels a suppliant for her son.</a>
<a id='line_8426'>  By Thetis and Aurora thou wert won</a>
<a id='line_8427'>  To forge impenetrable shields, and grace</a>
<a id='line_8428'>  With fated arms a less illustrious race.</a>
<a id='line_8429'>  Behold, what haughty nations are combin'd</a>
<a id='line_8430'>  Against the relics of the Phrygian kind,</a>
<a id='line_8431'>  With fire and sword my people to destroy,</a>
<a id='line_8432'>  And conquer Venus twice, in conqu'ring Troy."</a>
<a id='line_8433'>  She said; and straight her arms, of snowy hue,</a>
<a id='line_8434'>  About her unresolving husband threw.</a>
<a id='line_8435'>  Her soft embraces soon infuse desire;</a>
<a id='line_8436'>  His bones and marrow sudden warmth inspire;</a>
<a id='line_8437'>  And all the godhead feels the wonted fire.</a>
<a id='line_8438'>  Not half so swift the rattling thunder flies,</a>
<a id='line_8439'>  Or forky lightnings flash along the skies.</a>
<a id='line_8440'>  The goddess, proud of her successful wiles,</a>
<a id='line_8441'>  And conscious of her form, in secret smiles.</a>
<a id='line_8442'></a>
<a id='line_8443'>  Then thus the pow'r, obnoxious to her charms,</a>
<a id='line_8444'>  Panting, and half dissolving in her arms:</a>
<a id='line_8445'>  "Why seek you reasons for a cause so just,</a>
<a id='line_8446'>  Or your own beauties or my love distrust?</a>
<a id='line_8447'>  Long since, had you requir'd my helpful hand,</a>
<a id='line_8448'>  Th' artificer and art you might command,</a>
<a id='line_8449'>  To labor arms for Troy: nor Jove, nor fate,</a>
<a id='line_8450'>  Confin'd their empire to so short a date.</a>
<a id='line_8451'>  And, if you now desire new wars to wage,</a>
<a id='line_8452'>  My skill I promise, and my pains engage.</a>
<a id='line_8453'>  Whatever melting metals can conspire,</a>
<a id='line_8454'>  Or breathing bellows, or the forming fire,</a>
<a id='line_8455'>  Is freely yours: your anxious fears remove,</a>
<a id='line_8456'>  And think no task is difficult to love."</a>
<a id='line_8457'>  Trembling he spoke; and, eager of her charms,</a>
<a id='line_8458'>  He snatch'd the willing goddess to his arms;</a>
<a id='line_8459'>  Till in her lap infus'd, he lay possess'd</a>
<a id='line_8460'>  Of full desire, and sunk to pleasing rest.</a>
<a id='line_8461'>  Now when the Night her middle race had rode,</a>
<a id='line_8462'>  And his first slumber had refresh'd the god-</a>
<a id='line_8463'>  The time when early housewives leave the bed;</a>
<a id='line_8464'>  When living embers on the hearth they spread,</a>
<a id='line_8465'>  Supply the lamp, and call the maids to rise-</a>
<a id='line_8466'>  With yawning mouths, and with half-open'd eyes,</a>
<a id='line_8467'>  They ply the distaff by the winking light,</a>
<a id='line_8468'>  And to their daily labor add the night:</a>
<a id='line_8469'>  Thus frugally they earn their children's bread,</a>
<a id='line_8470'>  And uncorrupted keep the nuptial bed-</a>
<a id='line_8471'>  Not less concern'd, nor at a later hour,</a>
<a id='line_8472'>  Rose from his downy couch the forging pow'r.</a>
<a id='line_8473'></a>
<a id='line_8474'>  Sacred to Vulcan's name, an isle there lay,</a>
<a id='line_8475'>  Betwixt Sicilia's coasts and Lipare,</a>
<a id='line_8476'>  Rais'd high on smoking rocks; and, deep below,</a>
<a id='line_8477'>  In hollow caves the fires of Aetna glow.</a>
<a id='line_8478'>  The Cyclops here their heavy hammers deal;</a>
<a id='line_8479'>  Loud strokes, and hissings of tormented steel,</a>
<a id='line_8480'>  Are heard around; the boiling waters roar,</a>
<a id='line_8481'>  And smoky flames thro' fuming tunnels soar.</a>
<a id='line_8482'>  Hether the Father of the Fire, by night,</a>
<a id='line_8483'>  Thro' the brown air precipitates his flight.</a>
<a id='line_8484'>  On their eternal anvils here he found</a>
<a id='line_8485'>  The brethren beating, and the blows go round.</a>
<a id='line_8486'>  A load of pointless thunder now there lies</a>
<a id='line_8487'>  Before their hands, to ripen for the skies:</a>
<a id='line_8488'>  These darts, for angry Jove, they daily cast;</a>
<a id='line_8489'>  Consum'd on mortals with prodigious waste.</a>
<a id='line_8490'>  Three rays of writhen rain, of fire three more,</a>
<a id='line_8491'>  Of winged southern winds and cloudy store</a>
<a id='line_8492'>  As many parts, the dreadful mixture frame;</a>
<a id='line_8493'>  And fears are added, and avenging flame.</a>
<a id='line_8494'>  Inferior ministers, for Mars, repair</a>
<a id='line_8495'>  His broken axletrees and blunted war,</a>
<a id='line_8496'>  And send him forth again with furbish'd arms,</a>
<a id='line_8497'>  To wake the lazy war with trumpets' loud alarms.</a>
<a id='line_8498'>  The rest refresh the scaly snakes that fold</a>
<a id='line_8499'>  The shield of Pallas, and renew their gold.</a>
<a id='line_8500'>  Full on the crest the Gorgon's head they place,</a>
<a id='line_8501'>  With eyes that roll in death, and with distorted face.</a>
<a id='line_8502'></a>
<a id='line_8503'>  "My sons," said Vulcan, "set your tasks aside;</a>
<a id='line_8504'>  Your strength and master-skill must now be tried.</a>
<a id='line_8505'>  Arms for a hero forge; arms that require</a>
<a id='line_8506'>  Your force, your speed, and all your forming fire."</a>
<a id='line_8507'>  He said. They set their former work aside,</a>
<a id='line_8508'>  And their new toils with eager haste divide.</a>
<a id='line_8509'>  A flood of molten silver, brass, and gold,</a>
<a id='line_8510'>  And deadly steel, in the large furnace roll'd;</a>
<a id='line_8511'>  Of this, their artful hands a shield prepare,</a>
<a id='line_8512'>  Alone sufficient to sustain the war.</a>
<a id='line_8513'>  Sev'n orbs within a spacious round they close:</a>
<a id='line_8514'>  One stirs the fire, and one the bellows blows.</a>
<a id='line_8515'>  The hissing steel is in the smithy drown'd;</a>
<a id='line_8516'>  The grot with beaten anvils groans around.</a>
<a id='line_8517'>  By turns their arms advance, in equal time;</a>
<a id='line_8518'>  By turns their hands descend, and hammers chime.</a>
<a id='line_8519'>  They turn the glowing mass with crooked tongs;</a>
<a id='line_8520'>  The fiery work proceeds, with rustic songs.</a>
<a id='line_8521'></a>
<a id='line_8522'>  While, at the Lemnian god's command, they urge</a>
<a id='line_8523'>  Their labors thus, and ply th' Aeolian forge,</a>
<a id='line_8524'>  The cheerful morn salutes Evander's eyes,</a>
<a id='line_8525'>  And songs of chirping birds invite to rise.</a>
<a id='line_8526'>  He leaves his lowly bed: his buskins meet</a>
<a id='line_8527'>  Above his ankles; sandals sheathe his feet:</a>
<a id='line_8528'>  He sets his trusty sword upon his side,</a>
<a id='line_8529'>  And o'er his shoulder throws a panther's hide.</a>
<a id='line_8530'>  Two menial dogs before their master press'd.</a>
<a id='line_8531'>  Thus clad, and guarded thus, he seeks his kingly guest.</a>
<a id='line_8532'>  Mindful of promis'd aid, he mends his pace,</a>
<a id='line_8533'>  But meets Aeneas in the middle space.</a>
<a id='line_8534'>  Young Pallas did his father's steps attend,</a>
<a id='line_8535'>  And true Achates waited on his friend.</a>
<a id='line_8536'>  They join their hands; a secret seat they choose;</a>
<a id='line_8537'>  Th' Arcadian first their former talk renews:</a>
<a id='line_8538'>  "Undaunted prince, I never can believe</a>
<a id='line_8539'>  The Trojan empire lost, while you survive.</a>
<a id='line_8540'>  Command th' assistance of a faithful friend;</a>
<a id='line_8541'>  But feeble are the succors I can send.</a>
<a id='line_8542'>  Our narrow kingdom here the Tiber bounds;</a>
<a id='line_8543'>  That other side the Latian state surrounds,</a>
<a id='line_8544'>  Insults our walls, and wastes our fruitful grounds.</a>
<a id='line_8545'>  But mighty nations I prepare, to join</a>
<a id='line_8546'>  Their arms with yours, and aid your just design.</a>
<a id='line_8547'>  You come, as by your better genius sent,</a>
<a id='line_8548'>  And fortune seems to favor your intent.</a>
<a id='line_8549'>  Not far from hence there stands a hilly town,</a>
<a id='line_8550'>  Of ancient building, and of high renown,</a>
<a id='line_8551'>  Torn from the Tuscans by the Lydian race,</a>
<a id='line_8552'>  Who gave the name of Caere to the place,</a>
<a id='line_8553'>  Once Agyllina call'd. It flourish'd long,</a>
<a id='line_8554'>  In pride of wealth and warlike people strong,</a>
<a id='line_8555'>  Till curs'd Mezentius, in a fatal hour,</a>
<a id='line_8556'>  Assum'd the crown, with arbitrary pow'r.</a>
<a id='line_8557'>  What words can paint those execrable times,</a>
<a id='line_8558'>  The subjects' suff'rings, and the tyrant's crimes!</a>
<a id='line_8559'>  That blood, those murthers, O ye gods, replace</a>
<a id='line_8560'>  On his own head, and on his impious race!</a>
<a id='line_8561'>  The living and the dead at his command</a>
<a id='line_8562'>  Were coupled, face to face, and hand to hand,</a>
<a id='line_8563'>  Till, chok'd with stench, in loath'd embraces tied,</a>
<a id='line_8564'>  The ling'ring wretches pin'd away and died.</a>
<a id='line_8565'>  Thus plung'd in ills, and meditating more-</a>
<a id='line_8566'>  The people's patience, tir'd, no longer bore</a>
<a id='line_8567'>  The raging monster; but with arms beset</a>
<a id='line_8568'>  His house, and vengeance and destruction threat.</a>
<a id='line_8569'>  They fire his palace: while the flame ascends,</a>
<a id='line_8570'>  They force his guards, and execute his friends.</a>
<a id='line_8571'>  He cleaves the crowd, and, favor'd by the night,</a>
<a id='line_8572'>  To Turnus' friendly court directs his flight.</a>
<a id='line_8573'>  By just revenge the Tuscans set on fire,</a>
<a id='line_8574'>  With arms, their king to punishment require:</a>
<a id='line_8575'>  Their num'rous troops, now muster'd on the strand,</a>
<a id='line_8576'>  My counsel shall submit to your command.</a>
<a id='line_8577'>  Their navy swarms upon the coasts; they cry</a>
<a id='line_8578'>  To hoist their anchors, but the gods deny.</a>
<a id='line_8579'>  An ancient augur, skill'd in future fate,</a>
<a id='line_8580'>  With these foreboding words restrains their hate:</a>
<a id='line_8581'>  'Ye brave in arms, ye Lydian blood, the flow'r</a>

<a id='line_8584'>  To seek your tyrant's death by lawful arms;</a>
<a id='line_8585'>  Know this: no native of our land may lead</a>
<a id='line_8586'>  This pow'rful people; seek a foreign head.'</a>
<a id='line_8587'>  Aw'd with these words, in camps they still abide,</a>
<a id='line_8588'>  And wait with longing looks their promis'd guide.</a>
<a id='line_8589'>  Tarchon, the Tuscan chief, to me has sent</a>
<a id='line_8590'>  Their crown, and ev'ry regal ornament:</a>

<a id='line_8593'>  But the chill blood that creeps within my veins,</a>
<a id='line_8594'>  And age, and listless limbs unfit for pains,</a>
<a id='line_8595'>  And a soul conscious of its own decay,</a>
<a id='line_8596'>  Have forc'd me to refuse imperial sway.</a>
<a id='line_8597'>  My Pallas were more fit to mount the throne,</a>
<a id='line_8598'>  And should, but he's a Sabine mother's son,</a>
<a id='line_8599'>  And half a native; but, in you, combine</a>
<a id='line_8600'>  A manly vigor, and a foreign line.</a>
<a id='line_8601'>  Where Fate and smiling Fortune shew the way,</a>
<a id='line_8602'>  Pursue the ready path to sov'reign sway.</a>
<a id='line_8603'>  The staff of my declining days, my son,</a>
<a id='line_8604'>  Shall make your good or ill success his own;</a>
<a id='line_8605'>  In fighting fields from you shall learn to dare,</a>
<a id='line_8606'>  And serve the hard apprenticeship of war;</a>
<a id='line_8607'>  Your matchless courage and your conduct view,</a>
<a id='line_8608'>  And early shall begin t' admire and copy you.</a>
<a id='line_8609'>  Besides, two hundred horse he shall command;</a>
<a id='line_8610'>  Tho' few, a warlike and well-chosen band.</a>
<a id='line_8611'>  These in my name are listed; and my son</a>
<a id='line_8612'>  As many more has added in his own."</a>
<a id='line_8613'></a>
<a id='line_8614'>  Scarce had he said; Achates and his guest,</a>
<a id='line_8615'>  With downcast eyes, their silent grief express'd;</a>
<a id='line_8616'>  Who, short of succors, and in deep despair,</a>
<a id='line_8617'>  Shook at the dismal prospect of the war.</a>
<a id='line_8618'>  But his bright mother, from a breaking cloud,</a>
<a id='line_8619'>  To cheer her issue, thunder'd thrice aloud;</a>
<a id='line_8620'>  Thrice forky lightning flash'd along the sky,</a>
<a id='line_8621'>  And Tyrrhene trumpets thrice were heard on high.</a>
<a id='line_8622'>  Then, gazing up, repeated peals they hear;</a>
<a id='line_8623'>  And, in a heav'n serene, refulgent arms appear:</a>
<a id='line_8624'>  Redd'ning the skies, and glitt'ring all around,</a>
<a id='line_8625'>  The temper'd metals clash, and yield a silver sound.</a>
<a id='line_8626'>  The rest stood trembling, struck with awe divine;</a>
<a id='line_8627'>  Aeneas only, conscious to the sign,</a>
<a id='line_8628'>  Presag'd th' event, and joyful view'd, above,</a>
<a id='line_8629'>  Th' accomplish'd promise of the Queen of Love.</a>
<a id='line_8630'>  Then, to th' Arcadian king: "This prodigy</a>
<a id='line_8631'>  (Dismiss your fear) belongs alone to me.</a>
<a id='line_8632'>  Heav'n calls me to the war: th' expected sign</a>
<a id='line_8633'>  Is giv'n of promis'd aid, and arms divine.</a>
<a id='line_8634'>  My goddess mother, whose indulgent care</a>
<a id='line_8635'>  Foresaw the dangers of the growing war,</a>
<a id='line_8636'>  This omen gave, when bright Vulcanian arms,</a>
<a id='line_8637'>  Fated from force of steel by Stygian charms,</a>
<a id='line_8638'>  Suspended, shone on high: she then foreshow'd</a>
<a id='line_8639'>  Approaching fights, and fields to float in blood.</a>
<a id='line_8640'>  Turnus shall dearly pay for faith forsworn;</a>
<a id='line_8641'>  And corps, and swords, and shields, on Tiber borne,</a>
<a id='line_8642'>  Shall choke his flood: now sound the loud alarms;</a>
<a id='line_8643'>  And, Latian troops, prepare your perjur'd arms."</a>
<a id='line_8644'></a>
<a id='line_8645'>  He said, and, rising from his homely throne,</a>
<a id='line_8646'>  The solemn rites of Hercules begun,</a>
<a id='line_8647'>  And on his altars wak'd the sleeping fires;</a>
<a id='line_8648'>  Then cheerful to his household gods retires;</a>
<a id='line_8649'>  There offers chosen sheep. Th' Arcadian king</a>
<a id='line_8650'>  And Trojan youth the same oblations bring.</a>
<a id='line_8651'>  Next, of his men and ships he makes review;</a>
<a id='line_8652'>  Draws out the best and ablest of the crew.</a>
<a id='line_8653'>  Down with the falling stream the refuse run,</a>
<a id='line_8654'>  To raise with joyful news his drooping son.</a>
<a id='line_8655'>  Steeds are prepar'd to mount the Trojan band,</a>
<a id='line_8656'>  Who wait their leader to the Tyrrhene land.</a>
<a id='line_8657'>  A sprightly courser, fairer than the rest,</a>
<a id='line_8658'>  The king himself presents his royal guest:</a>
<a id='line_8659'>  A lion's hide his back and limbs infold,</a>
<a id='line_8660'>  Precious with studded work, and paws of gold.</a>
<a id='line_8661'>  Fame thro' the little city spreads aloud</a>
<a id='line_8662'>  Th' intended march, amid the fearful crowd:</a>
<a id='line_8663'>  The matrons beat their breasts, dissolve in tears,</a>
<a id='line_8664'>  And double their devotion in their fears.</a>
<a id='line_8665'>  The war at hand appears with more affright,</a>
<a id='line_8666'>  And rises ev'ry moment to the sight.</a>
<a id='line_8667'></a>
<a id='line_8668'>  Then old Evander, with a close embrace,</a>
<a id='line_8669'>  Strain'd his departing friend; and tears o'erflow his face.</a>
<a id='line_8670'>  "Would Heav'n," said he, "my strength and youth recall,</a>
<a id='line_8671'>  Such as I was beneath Praeneste's wall;</a>
<a id='line_8672'>  Then when I made the foremost foes retire,</a>
<a id='line_8673'>  And set whole heaps of conquer'd shields on fire;</a>
<a id='line_8674'>  When Herilus in single fight I slew,</a>
<a id='line_8675'>  Whom with three lives Feronia did endue;</a>
<a id='line_8676'>  And thrice I sent him to the Stygian shore,</a>
<a id='line_8677'>  Till the last ebbing soul return'd no more-</a>
<a id='line_8678'>  Such if I stood renew'd, not these alarms,</a>
<a id='line_8679'>  Nor death, should rend me from my Pallas' arms;</a>
<a id='line_8680'>  Nor proud Mezentius, thus unpunish'd, boast</a>
<a id='line_8681'>  His rapes and murthers on the Tuscan coast.</a>
<a id='line_8682'>  Ye gods, and mighty Jove, in pity bring</a>
<a id='line_8683'>  Relief, and hear a father and a king!</a>
<a id='line_8684'>  If fate and you reserve these eyes, to see</a>
<a id='line_8685'>  My son return with peace and victory;</a>
<a id='line_8686'>  If the lov'd boy shall bless his father's sight;</a>
<a id='line_8687'>  If we shall meet again with more delight;</a>
<a id='line_8688'>  Then draw my life in length; let me sustain,</a>
<a id='line_8689'>  In hopes of his embrace, the worst of pain.</a>
<a id='line_8690'>  But if your hard decrees- which, O! I dread-</a>
<a id='line_8691'>  Have doom'd to death his undeserving head;</a>
<a id='line_8692'>  This, O this very moment, let me die!</a>
<a id='line_8693'>  While hopes and fears in equal balance lie;</a>
<a id='line_8694'>  While, yet possess'd of all his youthful charms,</a>
<a id='line_8695'>  I strain him close within these aged arms;</a>
<a id='line_8696'>  Before that fatal news my soul shall wound!"</a>
<a id='line_8697'>  He said, and, swooning, sunk upon the ground.</a>
<a id='line_8698'>  His servants bore him off, and softly laid</a>
<a id='line_8699'>  His languish'd limbs upon his homely bed.</a>
<a id='line_8700'></a>
<a id='line_8701'>  The horsemen march; the gates are open'd wide;</a>
<a id='line_8702'>  Aeneas at their head, Achates by his side.</a>
<a id='line_8703'>  Next these, the Trojan leaders rode along;</a>
<a id='line_8704'>  Last follows in the rear th' Arcadian throng.</a>
<a id='line_8705'>  Young Pallas shone conspicuous o'er the rest;</a>
<a id='line_8706'>  Gilded his arms, embroider'd was his vest.</a>
<a id='line_8707'>  So, from the seas, exerts his radiant head</a>
<a id='line_8708'>  The star by whom the lights of heav'n are led;</a>
<a id='line_8709'>  Shakes from his rosy locks the pearly dews,</a>
<a id='line_8710'>  Dispels the darkness, and the day renews.</a>
<a id='line_8711'>  The trembling wives the walls and turrets crowd,</a>
<a id='line_8712'>  And follow, with their eyes, the dusty cloud,</a>
<a id='line_8713'>  Which winds disperse by fits, and shew from far</a>
<a id='line_8714'>  The blaze of arms, and shields, and shining war.</a>
<a id='line_8715'>  The troops, drawn up in beautiful array,</a>
<a id='line_8716'>  O'er heathy plains pursue the ready way.</a>
<a id='line_8717'>  Repeated peals of shouts are heard around;</a>
<a id='line_8718'>  The neighing coursers answer to the sound,</a>
<a id='line_8719'>  And shake with horny hoofs the solid ground.</a>
<a id='line_8720'></a>
<a id='line_8721'>  A greenwood shade, for long religion known,</a>
<a id='line_8722'>  Stands by the streams that wash the Tuscan town,</a>
<a id='line_8723'>  Incompass'd round with gloomy hills above,</a>
<a id='line_8724'>  Which add a holy horror to the grove.</a>
<a id='line_8725'>  The first inhabitants of Grecian blood,</a>
<a id='line_8726'>  That sacred forest to Silvanus vow'd,</a>
<a id='line_8727'>  The guardian of their flocks and fields; and pay</a>
<a id='line_8728'>  Their due devotions on his annual day.</a>
<a id='line_8729'>  Not far from hence, along the river's side,</a>
<a id='line_8730'>  In tents secure, the Tuscan troops abide,</a>
<a id='line_8731'>  By Tarchon led. Now, from a rising ground,</a>
<a id='line_8732'>  Aeneas cast his wond'ring eyes around,</a>
<a id='line_8733'>  And all the Tyrrhene army had in sight,</a>
<a id='line_8734'>  Stretch'd on the spacious plain from left to right.</a>
<a id='line_8735'>  Thether his warlike train the Trojan led,</a>
<a id='line_8736'>  Refresh'd his men, and wearied horses fed.</a>
<a id='line_8737'></a>
<a id='line_8738'>  Meantime the mother goddess, crown'd with charms,</a>
<a id='line_8739'>  Breaks thro' the clouds, and brings the fated arms.</a>
<a id='line_8740'>  Within a winding vale she finds her son,</a>
<a id='line_8741'>  On the cool river's banks, retir'd alone.</a>
<a id='line_8742'>  She shews her heav'nly form without disguise,</a>
<a id='line_8743'>  And gives herself to his desiring eyes.</a>
<a id='line_8744'>  "Behold," she said, "perform'd in ev'ry part,</a>
<a id='line_8745'>  My promise made, and Vulcan's labor'd art.</a>
<a id='line_8746'>  Now seek, secure, the Latian enemy,</a>
<a id='line_8747'>  And haughty Turnus to the field defy."</a>
<a id='line_8748'>  She said; and, having first her son embrac'd,</a>
<a id='line_8749'>  The radiant arms beneath an oak she plac'd,</a>
<a id='line_8750'>  Proud of the gift, he roll'd his greedy sight</a>
<a id='line_8751'>  Around the work, and gaz'd with vast delight.</a>
<a id='line_8752'>  He lifts, he turns, he poises, and admires</a>
<a id='line_8753'>  The crested helm, that vomits radiant fires:</a>
<a id='line_8754'>  His hands the fatal sword and corslet hold,</a>
<a id='line_8755'>  One keen with temper'd steel, one stiff with gold:</a>
<a id='line_8756'>  Both ample, flaming both, and beamy bright;</a>
<a id='line_8757'>  So shines a cloud, when edg'd with adverse light.</a>
<a id='line_8758'>  He shakes the pointed spear, and longs to try</a>
<a id='line_8759'>  The plated cuishes on his manly thigh;</a>
<a id='line_8760'>  But most admires the shield's mysterious mold,</a>
<a id='line_8761'>  And Roman triumphs rising on the gold:</a>
<a id='line_8762'>  For these, emboss'd, the heav'nly smith had wrought</a>
<a id='line_8763'>  (Not in the rolls of future fate untaught)</a>
<a id='line_8764'>  The wars in order, and the race divine</a>
<a id='line_8765'>  Of warriors issuing from the Julian line.</a>
<a id='line_8766'>  The cave of Mars was dress'd with mossy greens:</a>
<a id='line_8767'>  There, by the wolf, were laid the martial twins.</a>
<a id='line_8768'>  Intrepid on her swelling dugs they hung;</a>
<a id='line_8769'>  The foster dam loll'd out her fawning tongue:</a>
<a id='line_8770'>  They suck'd secure, while, bending back her head,</a>
<a id='line_8771'>  She lick'd their tender limbs, and form'd them as they fed.</a>
<a id='line_8772'>  Not far from thence new Rome appears, with games</a>
<a id='line_8773'>  Projected for the rape of Sabine dames.</a>
<a id='line_8774'>  The pit resounds with shrieks; a war succeeds,</a>
<a id='line_8775'>  For breach of public faith, and unexampled deeds.</a>
<a id='line_8776'>  Here for revenge the Sabine troops contend;</a>
<a id='line_8777'>  The Romans there with arms the prey defend.</a>
<a id='line_8778'>  Wearied with tedious war, at length they cease;</a>
<a id='line_8779'>  And both the kings and kingdoms plight the peace.</a>
<a id='line_8780'>  The friendly chiefs before Jove's altar stand,</a>
<a id='line_8781'>  Both arm'd, with each a charger in his hand:</a>
<a id='line_8782'>  A fatted sow for sacrifice is led,</a>
<a id='line_8783'>  With imprecations on the perjur'd head.</a>
<a id='line_8784'>  Near this, the traitor Metius, stretch'd between</a>
<a id='line_8785'>  Four fiery steeds, is dragg'd along the green,</a>
<a id='line_8786'>  By Tullus' doom: the brambles drink his blood,</a>
<a id='line_8787'>  And his torn limbs are left the vulture's food.</a>
<a id='line_8788'>  There, Porsena to Rome proud Tarquin brings,</a>
<a id='line_8789'>  And would by force restore the banish'd kings.</a>
<a id='line_8790'>  One tyrant for his fellow-tyrant fights;</a>
<a id='line_8791'>  The Roman youth assert their native rights.</a>
<a id='line_8792'>  Before the town the Tuscan army lies,</a>
<a id='line_8793'>  To win by famine, or by fraud surprise.</a>
<a id='line_8794'>  Their king, half-threat'ning, half-disdaining stood,</a>
<a id='line_8795'>  While Cocles broke the bridge, and stemm'd the flood.</a>
<a id='line_8796'>  The captive maids there tempt the raging tide,</a>
<a id='line_8797'>  Scap'd from their chains, with Cloelia for their guide.</a>
<a id='line_8798'>  High on a rock heroic Manlius stood,</a>
<a id='line_8799'>  To guard the temple, and the temple's god.</a>
<a id='line_8800'>  Then Rome was poor; and there you might behold</a>
<a id='line_8801'>  The palace thatch'd with straw, now roof'd with gold.</a>
<a id='line_8802'>  The silver goose before the shining gate</a>
<a id='line_8803'>  There flew, and, by her cackle, sav'd the state.</a>
<a id='line_8804'>  She told the Gauls' approach; th' approaching Gauls,</a>
<a id='line_8805'>  Obscure in night, ascend, and seize the walls.</a>
<a id='line_8806'>  The gold dissembled well their yellow hair,</a>
<a id='line_8807'>  And golden chains on their white necks they wear.</a>
<a id='line_8808'>  Gold are their vests; long Alpine spears they wield,</a>
<a id='line_8809'>  And their left arm sustains a length of shield.</a>
<a id='line_8810'>  Hard by, the leaping Salian priests advance;</a>
<a id='line_8811'>  And naked thro' the streets the mad Luperci dance,</a>
<a id='line_8812'>  In caps of wool; the targets dropp'd from heav'n.</a>
<a id='line_8813'>  Here modest matrons, in soft litters driv'n,</a>
<a id='line_8814'>  To pay their vows in solemn pomp appear,</a>
<a id='line_8815'>  And odorous gums in their chaste hands they bear.</a>
<a id='line_8816'>  Far hence remov'd, the Stygian seats are seen;</a>
<a id='line_8817'>  Pains of the damn'd, and punish'd Catiline</a>
<a id='line_8818'>  Hung on a rock- the traitor; and, around,</a>
<a id='line_8819'>  The Furies hissing from the nether ground.</a>
<a id='line_8820'>  Apart from these, the happy souls he draws,</a>
<a id='line_8821'>  And Cato's holy ghost dispensing laws.</a>
<a id='line_8822'></a>
<a id='line_8823'>  Betwixt the quarters flows a golden sea;</a>
<a id='line_8824'>  But foaming surges there in silver play.</a>
<a id='line_8825'>  The dancing dolphins with their tails divide</a>
<a id='line_8826'>  The glitt'ring waves, and cut the precious tide.</a>
<a id='line_8827'>  Amid the main, two mighty fleets engage</a>
<a id='line_8828'>  Their brazen beaks, oppos'd with equal rage.</a>
<a id='line_8829'>  Actium surveys the well-disputed prize;</a>
<a id='line_8830'>  Leucate's wat'ry plain with foamy billows fries.</a>
<a id='line_8831'>  Young Caesar, on the stern, in armor bright,</a>
<a id='line_8832'>  Here leads the Romans and their gods to fight:</a>
<a id='line_8833'>  His beamy temples shoot their flames afar,</a>
<a id='line_8834'>  And o'er his head is hung the Julian star.</a>
<a id='line_8835'>  Agrippa seconds him, with prosp'rous gales,</a>
<a id='line_8836'>  And, with propitious gods, his foes assails:</a>
<a id='line_8837'>  A naval crown, that binds his manly brows,</a>
<a id='line_8838'>  The happy fortune of the fight foreshows.</a>
<a id='line_8839'>  Rang'd on the line oppos'd, Antonius brings</a>
<a id='line_8840'>  Barbarian aids, and troops of Eastern kings;</a>
<a id='line_8841'>  Th' Arabians near, and Bactrians from afar,</a>
<a id='line_8842'>  Of tongues discordant, and a mingled war:</a>
<a id='line_8843'>  And, rich in gaudy robes, amidst the strife,</a>
<a id='line_8844'>  His ill fate follows him- th' Egyptian wife.</a>
<a id='line_8845'>  Moving they fight; with oars and forky prows</a>
<a id='line_8846'>  The froth is gather'd, and the water glows.</a>
<a id='line_8847'>  It seems, as if the Cyclades again</a>
<a id='line_8848'>  Were rooted up, and justled in the main;</a>
<a id='line_8849'>  Or floating mountains floating mountains meet;</a>
<a id='line_8850'>  Such is the fierce encounter of the fleet.</a>
<a id='line_8851'>  Fireballs are thrown, and pointed jav'lins fly;</a>
<a id='line_8852'>  The fields of Neptune take a purple dye.</a>
<a id='line_8853'>  The queen herself, amidst the loud alarms,</a>
<a id='line_8854'>  With cymbals toss'd her fainting soldiers warms-</a>
<a id='line_8855'>  Fool as she was! who had not yet divin'd</a>
<a id='line_8856'>  Her cruel fate, nor saw the snakes behind.</a>
<a id='line_8857'>  Her country gods, the monsters of the sky,</a>
<a id='line_8858'>  Great Neptune, Pallas, and Love's Queen defy:</a>
<a id='line_8859'>  The dog Anubis barks, but barks in vain,</a>
<a id='line_8860'>  Nor longer dares oppose th' ethereal train.</a>
<a id='line_8861'>  Mars in the middle of the shining shield</a>
<a id='line_8862'>  Is grav'd, and strides along the liquid field.</a>
<a id='line_8863'>  The Dirae souse from heav'n with swift descent;</a>
<a id='line_8864'>  And Discord, dyed in blood, with garments rent,</a>
<a id='line_8865'>  Divides the prease: her steps Bellona treads,</a>
<a id='line_8866'>  And shakes her iron rod above their heads.</a>
<a id='line_8867'>  This seen, Apollo, from his Actian height,</a>
<a id='line_8868'>  Pours down his arrows; at whose winged flight</a>
<a id='line_8869'>  The trembling Indians and Egyptians yield,</a>
<a id='line_8870'>  And soft Sabaeans quit the wat'ry field.</a>
<a id='line_8871'>  The fatal mistress hoists her silken sails,</a>
<a id='line_8872'>  And, shrinking from the fight, invokes the gales.</a>
<a id='line_8873'>  Aghast she looks, and heaves her breast for breath,</a>
<a id='line_8874'>  Panting, and pale with fear of future death.</a>
<a id='line_8875'>  The god had figur'd her as driv'n along</a>
<a id='line_8876'>  By winds and waves, and scudding thro' the throng.</a>
<a id='line_8877'>  Just opposite, sad Nilus opens wide</a>
<a id='line_8878'>  His arms and ample bosom to the tide,</a>
<a id='line_8879'>  And spreads his mantle o'er the winding coast,</a>
<a id='line_8880'>  In which he wraps his queen, and hides the flying host.</a>
<a id='line_8881'>  The victor to the gods his thanks express'd,</a>
<a id='line_8882'>  And Rome, triumphant, with his presence bless'd.</a>
<a id='line_8883'>  Three hundred temples in the town he plac'd;</a>
<a id='line_8884'>  With spoils and altars ev'ry temple grac'd.</a>
<a id='line_8885'>  Three shining nights, and three succeeding days,</a>
<a id='line_8886'>  The fields resound with shouts, the streets with praise,</a>
<a id='line_8887'>  The domes with songs, the theaters with plays.</a>
<a id='line_8888'>  All altars flame: before each altar lies,</a>
<a id='line_8889'>  Drench'd in his gore, the destin'd sacrifice.</a>
<a id='line_8890'>  Great Caesar sits sublime upon his throne,</a>
<a id='line_8891'>  Before Apollo's porch of Parian stone;</a>
<a id='line_8892'>  Accepts the presents vow'd for victory,</a>
<a id='line_8893'>  And hangs the monumental crowns on high.</a>
<a id='line_8894'>  Vast crowds of vanquish'd nations march along,</a>
<a id='line_8895'>  Various in arms, in habit, and in tongue.</a>

<a id='line_8897'>  For Carians, and th' ungirt Numidian race;</a>
<a id='line_8898'>  Then ranks the Thracians in the second row,</a>
<a id='line_8899'>  With Scythians, expert in the dart and bow.</a>
<a id='line_8900'>  And here the tam'd Euphrates humbly glides,</a>

<a id='line_8903'>  The Danes' unconquer'd offspring march behind,</a>
<a id='line_8904'>  And Morini, the last of humankind.</a>

<a id='line_8906'>  These figures, on the shield divinely wrought,</a>

<a id='line_8916'></a>
<a id='line_8917'>  While these affairs in distant places pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_8918'>  The various Iris Juno sends with haste,</a>
<a id='line_8919'>  To find bold Turnus, who, with anxious thought,</a>
<a id='line_8920'>  The secret shade of his great grandsire sought.</a>
<a id='line_8921'>  Retir'd alone she found the daring man,</a>
<a id='line_8922'>  And op'd her rosy lips, and thus began:</a>
<a id='line_8923'>  "What none of all the gods could grant thy vows,</a>
<a id='line_8924'>  That, Turnus, this auspicious day bestows.</a>
<a id='line_8925'>  Aeneas, gone to seek th' Arcadian prince,</a>
<a id='line_8926'>  Has left the Trojan camp without defense;</a>
<a id='line_8927'>  And, short of succors there, employs his pains</a>
<a id='line_8928'>  In parts remote to raise the Tuscan swains.</a>
<a id='line_8929'>  Now snatch an hour that favors thy designs;</a>
<a id='line_8930'>  Unite thy forces, and attack their lines."</a>
<a id='line_8931'>  This said, on equal wings she pois'd her weight,</a>
<a id='line_8932'>  And form'd a radiant rainbow in her flight.</a>
<a id='line_8933'></a>
<a id='line_8934'>  The Daunian hero lifts his hands eyes,</a>
<a id='line_8935'>  And thus invokes the goddess as she flies:</a>
<a id='line_8936'>  "Iris, the grace of heav'n, what pow'r divine</a>
<a id='line_8937'>  Has sent thee down, thro' dusky clouds to shine?</a>
<a id='line_8938'>  See, they divide; immortal day appears,</a>
<a id='line_8939'>  And glitt'ring planets dancing in their spheres!</a>
<a id='line_8940'>  With joy, these happy omens I obey,</a>
<a id='line_8941'>  And follow to the war the god that leads the way."</a>
<a id='line_8942'>  Thus having said, as by the brook he stood,</a>
<a id='line_8943'>  He scoop'd the water from the crystal flood;</a>
<a id='line_8944'>  Then with his hands the drops to heav'n he throws,</a>
<a id='line_8945'>  And loads the pow'rs above with offer'd vows.</a>
<a id='line_8946'></a>
<a id='line_8947'>  Now march the bold confed'rates thro' the plain,</a>
<a id='line_8948'>  Well hors'd, well clad; a rich and shining train.</a>
<a id='line_8949'>  Messapus leads the van; and, in the rear,</a>
<a id='line_8950'>  The sons of Tyrrheus in bright arms appear.</a>
<a id='line_8951'>  In the main battle, with his flaming crest,</a>
<a id='line_8952'>  The mighty Turnus tow'rs above the rest.</a>
<a id='line_8953'>  Silent they move, majestically slow,</a>
<a id='line_8954'>  Like ebbing Nile, or Ganges in his flow.</a>
<a id='line_8955'>  The Trojans view the dusty cloud from far,</a>
<a id='line_8956'>  And the dark menace of the distant war.</a>
<a id='line_8957'>  Caicus from the rampire saw it rise,</a>
<a id='line_8958'>  Black'ning the fields, and thick'ning thro' the skies.</a>
<a id='line_8959'>  Then to his fellows thus aloud he calls:</a>
<a id='line_8960'>  "What rolling clouds, my friends, approach the walls?</a>
<a id='line_8961'>  Arm! arm! and man the works! prepare your spears</a>
<a id='line_8962'>  And pointed darts! the Latian host appears."</a>
<a id='line_8963'></a>
<a id='line_8964'>  Thus warn'd, they shut their gates; with shouts ascend</a>
<a id='line_8965'>  The bulwarks, and, secure, their foes attend:</a>
<a id='line_8966'>  For their wise gen'ral, with foreseeing care,</a>
<a id='line_8967'>  Had charg'd them not to tempt the doubtful war,</a>
<a id='line_8968'>  Nor, tho' provok'd, in open fields advance,</a>
<a id='line_8969'>  But close within their lines attend their chance.</a>
<a id='line_8970'>  Unwilling, yet they keep the strict command,</a>
<a id='line_8971'>  And sourly wait in arms the hostile band.</a>
<a id='line_8972'>  The fiery Turnus flew before the rest:</a>
<a id='line_8973'>  A piebald steed of Thracian strain he press'd;</a>
<a id='line_8974'>  His helm of massy gold, and crimson was his crest.</a>
<a id='line_8975'>  With twenty horse to second his designs,</a>
<a id='line_8976'>  An unexpected foe, he fac'd the lines.</a>
<a id='line_8977'>  "Is there," he said, "in arms, who bravely dare</a>
<a id='line_8978'>  His leader's honor and his danger share?"</a>
<a id='line_8979'>  Then spurring on, his brandish'd dart he threw,</a>
<a id='line_8980'>  In sign of war: applauding shouts ensue.</a>
<a id='line_8981'></a>
<a id='line_8982'>  Amaz'd to find a dastard race, that run</a>
<a id='line_8983'>  Behind the rampires and the battle shun,</a>
<a id='line_8984'>  He rides around the camp, with rolling eyes,</a>
<a id='line_8985'>  And stops at ev'ry post, and ev'ry passage tries.</a>
<a id='line_8986'>  So roams the nightly wolf about the fold:</a>
<a id='line_8987'>  Wet with descending show'rs, and stiff with cold,</a>
<a id='line_8988'>  He howls for hunger, and he grins for pain,</a>
<a id='line_8989'>  (His gnashing teeth are exercis'd in vain,)</a>
<a id='line_8990'>  And, impotent of anger, finds no way</a>
<a id='line_8991'>  In his distended paws to grasp the prey.</a>
<a id='line_8992'>  The mothers listen; but the bleating lambs</a>
<a id='line_8993'>  Securely swig the dug, beneath the dams.</a>
<a id='line_8994'>  Thus ranges eager Turnus o'er the plain.</a>
<a id='line_8995'>  Sharp with desire, and furious with disdain;</a>
<a id='line_8996'>  Surveys each passage with a piercing sight,</a>
<a id='line_8997'>  To force his foes in equal field to fight.</a>
<a id='line_8998'>  Thus while he gazes round, at length he spies,</a>
<a id='line_8999'>  Where, fenc'd with strong redoubts, their navy lies,</a>
<a id='line_9000'>  Close underneath the walls; the washing tide</a>
<a id='line_9001'>  Secures from all approach this weaker side.</a>
<a id='line_9002'>  He takes the wish'd occasion, fills his hand</a>
<a id='line_9003'>  With ready fires, and shakes a flaming brand.</a>
<a id='line_9004'>  Urg'd by his presence, ev'ry soul is warm'd,</a>
<a id='line_9005'>  And ev'ry hand with kindled firs is arm'd.</a>
<a id='line_9006'>  From the fir'd pines the scatt'ring sparkles fly;</a>
<a id='line_9007'>  Fat vapors, mix'd with flames, involve the sky.</a>
<a id='line_9008'>  What pow'r, O Muses, could avert the flame</a>
<a id='line_9009'>  Which threaten'd, in the fleet, the Trojan name?</a>
<a id='line_9010'>  Tell: for the fact, thro' length of time obscure,</a>
<a id='line_9011'>  Is hard to faith; yet shall the fame endure.</a>
<a id='line_9012'></a>
<a id='line_9013'>  'T is said that, when the chief prepar'd his flight,</a>
<a id='line_9014'>  And fell'd his timber from Mount Ida's height,</a>
<a id='line_9015'>  The grandam goddess then approach'd her son,</a>
<a id='line_9016'>  And with a mother's majesty begun:</a>
<a id='line_9017'>  "Grant me," she said, "the sole request I bring,</a>
<a id='line_9018'>  Since conquer'd heav'n has own'd you for its king.</a>
<a id='line_9019'>  On Ida's brows, for ages past, there stood,</a>
<a id='line_9020'>  With firs and maples fill'd, a shady wood;</a>
<a id='line_9021'>  And on the summit rose a sacred grove,</a>
<a id='line_9022'>  Where I was worship'd with religious love.</a>
<a id='line_9023'>  Those woods, that holy grove, my long delight,</a>
<a id='line_9024'>  I gave the Trojan prince, to speed his flight.</a>
<a id='line_9025'>  Now, fill'd with fear, on their behalf I come;</a>
<a id='line_9026'>  Let neither winds o'erset, nor waves intomb</a>
<a id='line_9027'>  The floating forests of the sacred pine;</a>
<a id='line_9028'>  But let it be their safety to be mine."</a>
<a id='line_9029'>  Then thus replied her awful son, who rolls</a>
<a id='line_9030'>  The radiant stars, and heav'n and earth controls:</a>
<a id='line_9031'>  "How dare you, mother, endless date demand</a>
<a id='line_9032'>  For vessels molded by a mortal hand?</a>
<a id='line_9033'>  What then is fate? Shall bold Aeneas ride,</a>
<a id='line_9034'>  Of safety certain, on th' uncertain tide?</a>
<a id='line_9035'>  Yet, what I can, I grant; when, wafted o'er,</a>
<a id='line_9036'>  The chief is landed on the Latian shore,</a>
<a id='line_9037'>  Whatever ships escape the raging storms,</a>
<a id='line_9038'>  At my command shall change their fading forms</a>
<a id='line_9039'>  To nymphs divine, and plow the wat'ry way,</a>
<a id='line_9040'>  Like Dotis and the daughters of the sea."</a>
<a id='line_9041'>  To seal his sacred vow, by Styx he swore,</a>
<a id='line_9042'>  The lake of liquid pitch, the dreary shore,</a>
<a id='line_9043'>  And Phlegethon's innavigable flood,</a>
<a id='line_9044'>  And the black regions of his brother god.</a>
<a id='line_9045'>  He said; and shook the skies with his imperial nod.</a>
<a id='line_9046'></a>
<a id='line_9047'>  And now at length the number'd hours were come,</a>
<a id='line_9048'>  Prefix'd by fate's irrevocable doom,</a>
<a id='line_9049'>  When the great Mother of the Gods was free</a>
<a id='line_9050'>  To save her ships, and finish Jove's decree.</a>
<a id='line_9051'>  First, from the quarter of the morn, there sprung</a>
<a id='line_9052'>  A light that sign'd the heav'ns, and shot along;</a>
<a id='line_9053'>  Then from a cloud, fring'd round with golden fires,</a>
<a id='line_9054'>  Were timbrels heard, and Berecynthian choirs;</a>
<a id='line_9055'>  And, last, a voice, with more than mortal sounds,</a>
<a id='line_9056'>  Both hosts, in arms oppos'd, with equal horror wounds:</a>
<a id='line_9057'>  "O Trojan race, your needless aid forbear,</a>
<a id='line_9058'>  And know, my ships are my peculiar care.</a>
<a id='line_9059'>  With greater ease the bold Rutulian may,</a>
<a id='line_9060'>  With hissing brands, attempt to burn the sea,</a>
<a id='line_9061'>  Than singe my sacred pines. But you, my charge,</a>
<a id='line_9062'>  Loos'd from your crooked anchors, launch at large,</a>
<a id='line_9063'>  Exalted each a nymph: forsake the sand,</a>
<a id='line_9064'>  And swim the seas, at Cybele's command."</a>
<a id='line_9065'>  No sooner had the goddess ceas'd to speak,</a>
<a id='line_9066'>  When, lo! th' obedient ships their haulsers break;</a>
<a id='line_9067'>  And, strange to tell, like dolphins, in the main</a>
<a id='line_9068'>  They plunge their prows, and dive, and spring again:</a>
<a id='line_9069'>  As many beauteous maids the billows sweep,</a>
<a id='line_9070'>  As rode before tall vessels on the deep.</a>
<a id='line_9071'></a>
<a id='line_9072'>  The foes, surpris'd with wonder, stood aghast;</a>
<a id='line_9073'>  Messapus curb'd his fiery courser's haste;</a>
<a id='line_9074'>  Old Tiber roar'd, and, raising up his head,</a>
<a id='line_9075'>  Call'd back his waters to their oozy bed.</a>
<a id='line_9076'>  Turnus alone, undaunted, bore the shock,</a>
<a id='line_9077'>  And with these words his trembling troops bespoke:</a>
<a id='line_9078'>  "These monsters for the Trojans' fate are meant,</a>
<a id='line_9079'>  And are by Jove for black presages sent.</a>
<a id='line_9080'>  He takes the cowards' last relief away;</a>
<a id='line_9081'>  For fly they cannot, and, constrain'd to stay,</a>
<a id='line_9082'>  Must yield unfought, a base inglorious prey.</a>
<a id='line_9083'>  The liquid half of all the globe is lost;</a>
<a id='line_9084'>  Heav'n shuts the seas, and we secure the coast.</a>
<a id='line_9085'>  Theirs is no more than that small spot of ground</a>
<a id='line_9086'>  Which myriads of our martial men surround.</a>
<a id='line_9087'>  Their fates I fear not, or vain oracles.</a>
<a id='line_9088'>  'T was giv'n to Venus they should cross the seas,</a>
<a id='line_9089'>  And land secure upon the Latian plains:</a>
<a id='line_9090'>  Their promis'd hour is pass'd, and mine remains.</a>
<a id='line_9091'>  'T is in the fate of Turnus to destroy,</a>
<a id='line_9092'>  With sword and fire, the faithless race of Troy.</a>
<a id='line_9093'>  Shall such affronts as these alone inflame</a>
<a id='line_9094'>  The Grecian brothers, and the Grecian name?</a>
<a id='line_9095'>  My cause and theirs is one; a fatal strife,</a>
<a id='line_9096'>  And final ruin, for a ravish'd wife.</a>
<a id='line_9097'>  Was 't not enough, that, punish'd for the crime,</a>
<a id='line_9098'>  They fell; but will they fall a second time?</a>
<a id='line_9099'>  One would have thought they paid enough before,</a>
<a id='line_9100'>  To curse the costly sex, and durst offend no more.</a>
<a id='line_9101'>  Can they securely trust their feeble wall,</a>
<a id='line_9102'>  A slight partition, a thin interval,</a>
<a id='line_9103'>  Betwixt their fate and them; when Troy, tho' built</a>
<a id='line_9104'>  By hands divine, yet perish'd by their guilt?</a>
<a id='line_9105'>  Lend me, for once, my friends, your valiant hands,</a>
<a id='line_9106'>  To force from out their lines these dastard bands.</a>
<a id='line_9107'>  Less than a thousand ships will end this war,</a>
<a id='line_9108'>  Nor Vulcan needs his fated arms prepare.</a>
<a id='line_9109'>  Let all the Tuscans, all th' Arcadians, join!</a>
<a id='line_9110'>  Nor these, nor those, shall frustrate my design.</a>
<a id='line_9111'>  Let them not fear the treasons of the night,</a>
<a id='line_9112'>  The robb'd Palladium, the pretended flight:</a>
<a id='line_9113'>  Our onset shall be made in open light.</a>
<a id='line_9114'>  No wooden engine shall their town betray;</a>
<a id='line_9115'>  Fires they shall have around, but fires by day.</a>
<a id='line_9116'>  No Grecian babes before their camp appear,</a>
<a id='line_9117'>  Whom Hector's arms detain'd to the tenth tardy year.</a>
<a id='line_9118'>  Now, since the sun is rolling to the west,</a>
<a id='line_9119'>  Give we the silent night to needful rest:</a>
<a id='line_9120'>  Refresh your bodies, and your arms prepare;</a>
<a id='line_9121'>  The morn shall end the small remains of war."</a>
<a id='line_9122'></a>
<a id='line_9123'>  The post of honor to Messapus falls,</a>
<a id='line_9124'>  To keep the nightly guard, to watch the walls,</a>
<a id='line_9125'>  To pitch the fires at distances around,</a>
<a id='line_9126'>  And close the Trojans in their scanty ground.</a>
<a id='line_9127'>  Twice seven Rutulian captains ready stand,</a>
<a id='line_9128'>  And twice seven hundred horse these chiefs command;</a>
<a id='line_9129'>  All clad in shining arms the works invest,</a>
<a id='line_9130'>  Each with a radiant helm and waving crest.</a>
<a id='line_9131'>  Stretch'd at their length, they press the grassy ground;</a>
<a id='line_9132'>  They laugh, they sing, (the jolly bowls go round,)</a>
<a id='line_9133'>  With lights and cheerful fires renew the day,</a>
<a id='line_9134'>  And pass the wakeful night in feasts and play.</a>
<a id='line_9135'></a>
<a id='line_9136'>  The Trojans, from above, their foes beheld,</a>
<a id='line_9137'>  And with arm'd legions all the rampires fill'd.</a>
<a id='line_9138'>  Seiz'd with affright, their gates they first explore;</a>
<a id='line_9139'>  Join works to works with bridges, tow'r to tow'r:</a>
<a id='line_9140'>  Thus all things needful for defense abound.</a>
<a id='line_9141'>  Mnestheus and brave Seresthus walk the round,</a>
<a id='line_9142'>  Commission'd by their absent prince to share</a>
<a id='line_9143'>  The common danger, and divide the care.</a>
<a id='line_9144'>  The soldiers draw their lots, and, as they fall,</a>
<a id='line_9145'>  By turns relieve each other on the wall.</a>
<a id='line_9146'></a>
<a id='line_9147'>  Nigh where the foes their utmost guards advance,</a>
<a id='line_9148'>  To watch the gate was warlike Nisus' chance.</a>
<a id='line_9149'>  His father Hyrtacus of noble blood;</a>
<a id='line_9150'>  His mother was a huntress of the wood,</a>
<a id='line_9151'>  And sent him to the wars. Well could he bear</a>
<a id='line_9152'>  His lance in fight, and dart the flying spear,</a>
<a id='line_9153'>  But better skill'd unerring shafts to send.</a>
<a id='line_9154'>  Beside him stood Euryalus, his friend:</a>
<a id='line_9155'>  Euryalus, than whom the Trojan host</a>
<a id='line_9156'>  No fairer face, or sweeter air, could boast-</a>
<a id='line_9157'>  Scarce had the down to shade his cheeks begun.</a>
<a id='line_9158'>  One was their care, and their delight was one:</a>
<a id='line_9159'>  One common hazard in the war they shar'd,</a>
<a id='line_9160'>  And now were both by choice upon the guard.</a>
<a id='line_9161'></a>
<a id='line_9162'>  Then Nisus thus: "Or do the gods inspire</a>
<a id='line_9163'>  This warmth, or make we gods of our desire?</a>
<a id='line_9164'>  A gen'rous ardor boils within my breast,</a>
<a id='line_9165'>  Eager of action, enemy to rest:</a>
<a id='line_9166'>  This urges me to fight, and fires my mind</a>
<a id='line_9167'>  To leave a memorable name behind.</a>
<a id='line_9168'>  Thou see'st the foe secure; how faintly shine</a>
<a id='line_9169'>  Their scatter'd fires! the most, in sleep supine</a>
<a id='line_9170'>  Along the ground, an easy conquest lie:</a>
<a id='line_9171'>  The wakeful few the fuming flagon ply;</a>
<a id='line_9172'>  All hush'd around. Now hear what I revolve-</a>
<a id='line_9173'>  A thought unripe- and scarcely yet resolve.</a>
<a id='line_9174'>  Our absent prince both camp and council mourn;</a>
<a id='line_9175'>  By message both would hasten his return:</a>
<a id='line_9176'>  If they confer what I demand on thee,</a>
<a id='line_9177'>  (For fame is recompense enough for me,)</a>
<a id='line_9178'>  Methinks, beneath yon hill, I have espied</a>
<a id='line_9179'>  A way that safely will my passage guide."</a>
<a id='line_9180'></a>
<a id='line_9181'>  Euryalus stood list'ning while he spoke,</a>
<a id='line_9182'>  With love of praise and noble envy struck;</a>
<a id='line_9183'>  Then to his ardent friend expos'd his mind:</a>
<a id='line_9184'>  "All this, alone, and leaving me behind!</a>
<a id='line_9185'>  Am I unworthy, Nisus, to be join'd?</a>
<a id='line_9186'>  Thinkist thou I can my share of glory yield,</a>
<a id='line_9187'>  Or send thee unassisted to the field?</a>
<a id='line_9188'>  Not so my father taught my childhood arms;</a>
<a id='line_9189'>  Born in a siege, and bred among alarms!</a>
<a id='line_9190'>  Nor is my youth unworthy of my friend,</a>
<a id='line_9191'>  Nor of the heav'n-born hero I attend.</a>
<a id='line_9192'>  The thing call'd life, with ease I can disclaim,</a>
<a id='line_9193'>  And think it over-sold to purchase fame."</a>
<a id='line_9194'></a>
<a id='line_9195'>  Then Nisus thus: "Alas! thy tender years</a>
<a id='line_9196'>  Would minister new matter to my fears.</a>
<a id='line_9197'>  So may the gods, who view this friendly strife,</a>
<a id='line_9198'>  Restore me to thy lov'd embrace with life,</a>
<a id='line_9199'>  Condemn'd to pay my vows, (as sure I trust,)</a>
<a id='line_9200'>  This thy request is cruel and unjust.</a>
<a id='line_9201'>  But if some chance- as many chances are,</a>
<a id='line_9202'>  And doubtful hazards, in the deeds of war-</a>
<a id='line_9203'>  If one should reach my head, there let it fall,</a>
<a id='line_9204'>  And spare thy life; I would not perish all.</a>
<a id='line_9205'>  Thy bloomy youth deserves a longer date:</a>
<a id='line_9206'>  Live thou to mourn thy love's unhappy fate;</a>
<a id='line_9207'>  To bear my mangled body from the foe,</a>
<a id='line_9208'>  Or buy it back, and fun'ral rites bestow.</a>
<a id='line_9209'>  Or, if hard fortune shall those dues deny,</a>
<a id='line_9210'>  Thou canst at least an empty tomb supply.</a>
<a id='line_9211'>  O let not me the widow's tears renew!</a>
<a id='line_9212'>  Nor let a mother's curse my name pursue:</a>
<a id='line_9213'>  Thy pious parent, who, for love of thee,</a>
<a id='line_9214'>  Forsook the coasts of friendly Sicily,</a>
<a id='line_9215'>  Her age committing to the seas and wind,</a>
<a id='line_9216'>  When ev'ry weary matron stay'd behind."</a>
<a id='line_9217'>  To this, Euryalus: "You plead in vain,</a>
<a id='line_9218'>  And but protract the cause you cannot gain.</a>
<a id='line_9219'>  No more delays, but haste!" With that, he wakes</a>
<a id='line_9220'>  The nodding watch; each to his office takes.</a>
<a id='line_9221'>  The guard reliev'd, the gen'rous couple went</a>
<a id='line_9222'>  To find the council at the royal tent.</a>
<a id='line_9223'></a>
<a id='line_9224'>  All creatures else forgot their daily care,</a>
<a id='line_9225'>  And sleep, the common gift of nature, share;</a>
<a id='line_9226'>  Except the Trojan peers, who wakeful sate</a>
<a id='line_9227'>  In nightly council for th' indanger'd state.</a>
<a id='line_9228'>  They vote a message to their absent chief,</a>
<a id='line_9229'>  Shew their distress, and beg a swift relief.</a>
<a id='line_9230'>  Amid the camp a silent seat they chose,</a>
<a id='line_9231'>  Remote from clamor, and secure from foes.</a>
<a id='line_9232'>  On their left arms their ample shields they bear,</a>
<a id='line_9233'>  The right reclin'd upon the bending spear.</a>
<a id='line_9234'>  Now Nisus and his friend approach the guard,</a>
<a id='line_9235'>  And beg admission, eager to be heard:</a>
<a id='line_9236'>  Th' affair important, not to be deferr'd.</a>
<a id='line_9237'>  Ascanius bids 'em be conducted in,</a>
<a id='line_9238'>  Ord'ring the more experienc'd to begin.</a>
<a id='line_9239'>  Then Nisus thus: "Ye fathers, lend your ears;</a>
<a id='line_9240'>  Nor judge our bold attempt beyond our years.</a>
<a id='line_9241'>  The foe, securely drench'd in sleep and wine,</a>
<a id='line_9242'>  Neglect their watch; the fires but thinly shine;</a>
<a id='line_9243'>  And where the smoke in cloudy vapors flies,</a>
<a id='line_9244'>  Cov'ring the plain, and curling to the skies,</a>
<a id='line_9245'>  Betwixt two paths, which at the gate divide,</a>
<a id='line_9246'>  Close by the sea, a passage we have spied,</a>
<a id='line_9247'>  Which will our way to great Aeneas guide.</a>
<a id='line_9248'>  Expect each hour to see him safe again,</a>
<a id='line_9249'>  Loaded with spoils of foes in battle slain.</a>
<a id='line_9250'>  Snatch we the lucky minute while we may;</a>
<a id='line_9251'>  Nor can we be mistaken in the way;</a>
<a id='line_9252'>  For, hunting in the vale, we both have seen</a>
<a id='line_9253'>  The rising turrets, and the stream between,</a>
<a id='line_9254'>  And know the winding course, with ev'ry ford."</a>
<a id='line_9255'></a>
<a id='line_9256'>  He ceas'd; and old Alethes took the word:</a>
<a id='line_9257'>  "Our country gods, in whom our trust we place,</a>
<a id='line_9258'>  Will yet from ruin save the Trojan race,</a>
<a id='line_9259'>  While we behold such dauntless worth appear</a>
<a id='line_9260'>  In dawning youth, and souls so void of fear."</a>
<a id='line_9261'>  Then into tears of joy the father broke;</a>
<a id='line_9262'>  Each in his longing arms by turns he took;</a>
<a id='line_9263'>  Panted and paus'd; and thus again he spoke:</a>
<a id='line_9264'>  "Ye brave young men, what equal gifts can we,</a>
<a id='line_9265'>  In recompense of such desert, decree?</a>
<a id='line_9266'>  The greatest, sure, and best you can receive,</a>
<a id='line_9267'>  The gods and your own conscious worth will give.</a>
<a id='line_9268'>  The rest our grateful gen'ral will bestow,</a>
<a id='line_9269'>  And young Ascanius till his manhood owe."</a>
<a id='line_9270'></a>
<a id='line_9271'>  "And I, whose welfare in my father lies,"</a>
<a id='line_9272'>  Ascanius adds, "by the great deities,</a>
<a id='line_9273'>  By my dear country, by my household gods,</a>
<a id='line_9274'>  By hoary Vesta's rites and dark abodes,</a>
<a id='line_9275'>  Adjure you both, (on you my fortune stands;</a>
<a id='line_9276'>  That and my faith I plight into your hands,)</a>
<a id='line_9277'>  Make me but happy in his safe return,</a>
<a id='line_9278'>  Whose wanted presence I can only mourn;</a>
<a id='line_9279'>  Your common gift shall two large goblets be</a>
<a id='line_9280'>  Of silver, wrought with curious imagery,</a>
<a id='line_9281'>  And high emboss'd, which, when old Priam reign'd,</a>
<a id='line_9282'>  My conqu'ring sire at sack'd Arisba gain'd;</a>
<a id='line_9283'>  And more, two tripods cast in antic mold,</a>
<a id='line_9284'>  With two great talents of the finest gold;</a>
<a id='line_9285'>  Beside a costly bowl, ingrav'd with art,</a>
<a id='line_9286'>  Which Dido gave, when first she gave her heart.</a>
<a id='line_9287'>  But, if in conquer'd Italy we reign,</a>
<a id='line_9288'>  When spoils by lot the victor shall obtain-</a>
<a id='line_9289'>  Thou saw'st the courser by proud Turnus press'd:</a>
<a id='line_9290'>  That, Nisus, and his arms, and nodding crest,</a>
<a id='line_9291'>  And shield, from chance exempt, shall be thy share:</a>
<a id='line_9292'>  Twelve lab'ring slaves, twelve handmaids young and fair</a>
<a id='line_9293'>  All clad in rich attire, and train'd with care;</a>
<a id='line_9294'>  And, last, a Latian field with fruitful plains,</a>
<a id='line_9295'>  And a large portion of the king's domains.</a>
<a id='line_9296'>  But thou, whose years are more to mine allied-</a>
<a id='line_9297'>  No fate my vow'd affection shall divide</a>
<a id='line_9298'>  From thee, heroic youth! Be wholly mine;</a>
<a id='line_9299'>  Take full possession; all my soul is thine.</a>
<a id='line_9300'>  One faith, one fame, one fate, shall both attend;</a>
<a id='line_9301'>  My life's companion, and my bosom friend:</a>
<a id='line_9302'>  My peace shall be committed to thy care,</a>
<a id='line_9303'>  And to thy conduct my concerns in war."</a>
<a id='line_9304'></a>
<a id='line_9305'>  Then thus the young Euryalus replied:</a>
<a id='line_9306'>  "Whatever fortune, good or bad, betide,</a>
<a id='line_9307'>  The same shall be my age, as now my youth;</a>
<a id='line_9308'>  No time shall find me wanting to my truth.</a>
<a id='line_9309'>  This only from your goodness let me gain</a>
<a id='line_9310'>  (And, this ungranted, all rewards are vain)</a>
<a id='line_9311'>  Of Priam's royal race my mother came-</a>
<a id='line_9312'>  And sure the best that ever bore the name-</a>
<a id='line_9313'>  Whom neither Troy nor Sicily could hold</a>
<a id='line_9314'>  From me departing, but, o'erspent and old,</a>
<a id='line_9315'>  My fate she follow'd. Ignorant of this</a>
<a id='line_9316'>  (Whatever) danger, neither parting kiss,</a>
<a id='line_9317'>  Nor pious blessing taken, her I leave,</a>
<a id='line_9318'>  And in this only act of all my life deceive.</a>
<a id='line_9319'>  By this right hand and conscious Night I swear,</a>
<a id='line_9320'>  My soul so sad a farewell could not bear.</a>
<a id='line_9321'>  Be you her comfort; fill my vacant place</a>
<a id='line_9322'>  (Permit me to presume so great a grace)</a>
<a id='line_9323'>  Support her age, forsaken and distress'd.</a>
<a id='line_9324'>  That hope alone will fortify my breast</a>
<a id='line_9325'>  Against the worst of fortunes, and of fears."</a>
<a id='line_9326'>  He said. The mov'd assistants melt in tears.</a>
<a id='line_9327'></a>
<a id='line_9328'>  Then thus Ascanius, wonderstruck to see</a>
<a id='line_9329'>  That image of his filial piety:</a>
<a id='line_9330'>  "So great beginnings, in so green an age,</a>
<a id='line_9331'>  Exact the faith which I again ingage.</a>
<a id='line_9332'>  Thy mother all the dues shall justly claim,</a>
<a id='line_9333'>  Creusa had, and only want the name.</a>
<a id='line_9334'>  Whate'er event thy bold attempt shall have,</a>
<a id='line_9335'>  'T is merit to have borne a son so brave.</a>
<a id='line_9336'>  Now by my head, a sacred oath, I swear,</a>
<a id='line_9337'>  (My father us'd it,) what, returning here</a>
<a id='line_9338'>  Crown'd with success, I for thyself prepare,</a>
<a id='line_9339'>  That, if thou fail, shall thy lov'd mother share."</a>
<a id='line_9340'></a>
<a id='line_9341'>  He said, and weeping, while he spoke the word,</a>
<a id='line_9342'>  From his broad belt he drew a shining sword,</a>
<a id='line_9343'>  Magnificent with gold. Lycaon made,</a>
<a id='line_9344'>  And in an ivory scabbard sheath'd the blade.</a>
<a id='line_9345'>  This was his gift. Great Mnestheus gave his friend</a>
<a id='line_9346'>  A lion's hide, his body to defend;</a>
<a id='line_9347'>  And good Alethes furnish'd him, beside,</a>
<a id='line_9348'>  With his own trusty helm, of temper tried.</a>
<a id='line_9349'></a>
<a id='line_9350'>  Thus arm'd they went. The noble Trojans wait</a>
<a id='line_9351'>  Their issuing forth, and follow to the gate</a>
<a id='line_9352'>  With prayers and vows. Above the rest appears</a>
<a id='line_9353'>  Ascanius, manly far beyond his years,</a>
<a id='line_9354'>  And messages committed to their care,</a>
<a id='line_9355'>  Which all in winds were lost, and flitting air.</a>
<a id='line_9356'></a>
<a id='line_9357'>  The trenches first they pass'd; then took their way</a>
<a id='line_9358'>  Where their proud foes in pitch'd pavilions lay;</a>
<a id='line_9359'>  To many fatal, ere themselves were slain.</a>
<a id='line_9360'>  They found the careless host dispers'd upon the plain,</a>
<a id='line_9361'>  Who, gorg'd, and drunk with wine, supinely snore.</a>
<a id='line_9362'>  Unharness'd chariots stand along the shore:</a>
<a id='line_9363'>  Amidst the wheels and reins, the goblet by,</a>
<a id='line_9364'>  A medley of debauch and war, they lie.</a>
<a id='line_9365'>  Observing Nisus shew'd his friend the sight:</a>
<a id='line_9366'>  "Behold a conquest gain'd without a fight.</a>
<a id='line_9367'>  Occasion offers, and I stand prepar'd;</a>
<a id='line_9368'>  There lies our way; be thou upon the guard,</a>
<a id='line_9369'>  And look around, while I securely go,</a>
<a id='line_9370'>  And hew a passage thro' the sleeping foe."</a>
<a id='line_9371'>  Softly he spoke; then striding took his way,</a>
<a id='line_9372'>  With his drawn sword, where haughty Rhamnes lay;</a>
<a id='line_9373'>  His head rais'd high on tapestry beneath,</a>
<a id='line_9374'>  And heaving from his breast, he drew his breath;</a>
<a id='line_9375'>  A king and prophet, by King Turnus lov'd:</a>
<a id='line_9376'>  But fate by prescience cannot be remov'd.</a>
<a id='line_9377'>  Him and his sleeping slaves he slew; then spies</a>
<a id='line_9378'>  Where Remus, with his rich retinue, lies.</a>
<a id='line_9379'>  His armor-bearer first, and next he kills</a>
<a id='line_9380'>  His charioteer, intrench'd betwixt the wheels</a>
<a id='line_9381'>  And his lov'd horses; last invades their lord;</a>
<a id='line_9382'>  Full on his neck he drives the fatal sword:</a>
<a id='line_9383'>  The gasping head flies off; a purple flood</a>
<a id='line_9384'>  Flows from the trunk, that welters in the blood,</a>
<a id='line_9385'>  Which, by the spurning heels dispers'd around,</a>
<a id='line_9386'>  The bed besprinkles and bedews the ground.</a>
<a id='line_9387'>  Lamus the bold, and Lamyrus the strong,</a>
<a id='line_9388'>  He slew, and then Serranus fair and young.</a>
<a id='line_9389'>  From dice and wine the youth retir'd to rest,</a>
<a id='line_9390'>  And puff'd the fumy god from out his breast:</a>
<a id='line_9391'>  Ev'n then he dreamt of drink and lucky play-</a>
<a id='line_9392'>  More lucky, had it lasted till the day.</a>
<a id='line_9393'>  The famish'd lion thus, with hunger bold,</a>
<a id='line_9394'>  O'erleaps the fences of the nightly fold,</a>
<a id='line_9395'>  And tears the peaceful flocks: with silent awe</a>
<a id='line_9396'>  Trembling they lie, and pant beneath his paw.</a>
<a id='line_9397'></a>
<a id='line_9398'>  Nor with less rage Euryalus employs</a>
<a id='line_9399'>  The wrathful sword, or fewer foes destroys;</a>
<a id='line_9400'>  But on th' ignoble crowd his fury flew;</a>
<a id='line_9401'>  He Fadus, Hebesus, and Rhoetus slew.</a>
<a id='line_9402'>  Oppress'd with heavy sleep the former fell,</a>
<a id='line_9403'>  But Rhoetus wakeful, and observing all:</a>
<a id='line_9404'>  Behind a spacious jar he slink'd for fear;</a>
<a id='line_9405'>  The fatal iron found and reach'd him there;</a>
<a id='line_9406'>  For, as he rose, it pierc'd his naked side,</a>
<a id='line_9407'>  And, reeking, thence return'd in crimson dyed.</a>
<a id='line_9408'>  The wound pours out a stream of wine and blood;</a>
<a id='line_9409'>  The purple soul comes floating in the flood.</a>
<a id='line_9410'></a>
<a id='line_9411'>  Now, where Messapus quarter'd, they arrive.</a>
<a id='line_9412'>  The fires were fainting there, and just alive;</a>
<a id='line_9413'>  The warrior-horses, tied in order, fed.</a>
<a id='line_9414'>  Nisus observ'd the discipline, and said:</a>
<a id='line_9415'>  "Our eager thirst of blood may both betray;</a>
<a id='line_9416'>  And see the scatter'd streaks of dawning day,</a>
<a id='line_9417'>  Foe to nocturnal thefts. No more, my friend;</a>
<a id='line_9418'>  Here let our glutted execution end.</a>
<a id='line_9419'>  A lane thro' slaughter'd bodies we have made."</a>
<a id='line_9420'>  The bold Euryalus, tho' loth, obey'd.</a>
<a id='line_9421'>  Of arms, and arras, and of plate, they find</a>
<a id='line_9422'>  A precious load; but these they leave behind.</a>
<a id='line_9423'>  Yet, fond of gaudy spoils, the boy would stay</a>
<a id='line_9424'>  To make the rich caparison his prey,</a>
<a id='line_9425'>  Which on the steed of conquer'd Rhamnes lay.</a>
<a id='line_9426'>  Nor did his eyes less longingly behold</a>
<a id='line_9427'>  The girdle-belt, with nails of burnish'd gold.</a>
<a id='line_9428'>  This present Caedicus the rich bestow'd</a>
<a id='line_9429'>  On Remulus, when friendship first they vow'd,</a>
<a id='line_9430'>  And, absent, join'd in hospitable ties:</a>
<a id='line_9431'>  He, dying, to his heir bequeath'd the prize;</a>
<a id='line_9432'>  Till, by the conqu'ring Ardean troops oppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_9433'>  He fell; and they the glorious gift possess'd.</a>
<a id='line_9434'>  These glitt'ring spoils (now made the victor's gain)</a>
<a id='line_9435'>  He to his body suits, but suits in vain:</a>
<a id='line_9436'>  Messapus' helm he finds among the rest,</a>
<a id='line_9437'>  And laces on, and wears the waving crest.</a>
<a id='line_9438'>  Proud of their conquest, prouder of their prey,</a>
<a id='line_9439'>  They leave the camp, and take the ready way.</a>
<a id='line_9440'></a>
<a id='line_9441'>  But far they had not pass'd, before they spied</a>
<a id='line_9442'>  Three hundred horse, with Volscens for their guide.</a>
<a id='line_9443'>  The queen a legion to King Turnus sent;</a>
<a id='line_9444'>  But the swift horse the slower foot prevent,</a>
<a id='line_9445'>  And now, advancing, sought the leader's tent.</a>
<a id='line_9446'>  They saw the pair; for, thro' the doubtful shade,</a>
<a id='line_9447'>  His shining helm Euryalus betray'd,</a>
<a id='line_9448'>  On which the moon with full reflection play'd.</a>
<a id='line_9449'>  "'T is not for naught," cried Volscens from the crowd,</a>
<a id='line_9450'>  "These men go there;" then rais'd his voice aloud:</a>
<a id='line_9451'>  "Stand! stand! why thus in arms? And whither bent?</a>
<a id='line_9452'>  From whence, to whom, and on what errand sent?"</a>
<a id='line_9453'>  Silent they scud away, and haste their flight</a>
<a id='line_9454'>  To neighb'ring woods, and trust themselves to night.</a>
<a id='line_9455'>  The speedy horse all passages belay,</a>
<a id='line_9456'>  And spur their smoking steeds to cross their way,</a>
<a id='line_9457'>  And watch each entrance of the winding wood.</a>
<a id='line_9458'>  Black was the forest: thick with beech it stood,</a>
<a id='line_9459'>  Horrid with fern, and intricate with thorn;</a>
<a id='line_9460'>  Few paths of human feet, or tracks of beasts, were worn.</a>
<a id='line_9461'>  The darkness of the shades, his heavy prey,</a>
<a id='line_9462'>  And fear, misled the younger from his way.</a>
<a id='line_9463'>  But Nisus hit the turns with happier haste,</a>
<a id='line_9464'>  And, thoughtless of his friend, the forest pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_9465'>  And Alban plains, from Alba's name so call'd,</a>
<a id='line_9466'>  Where King Latinus then his oxen stall'd;</a>
<a id='line_9467'>  Till, turning at the length, he stood his ground,</a>
<a id='line_9468'>  And miss'd his friend, and cast his eyes around:</a>
<a id='line_9469'>  "Ah wretch!" he cried, "where have I left behind</a>
<a id='line_9470'>  Th' unhappy youth? where shall I hope to find?</a>
<a id='line_9471'>  Or what way take?" Again he ventures back,</a>
<a id='line_9472'>  And treads the mazes of his former track.</a>
<a id='line_9473'>  He winds the wood, and, list'ning, hears the noise</a>
<a id='line_9474'>  Of tramping coursers, and the riders' voice.</a>
<a id='line_9475'>  The sound approach'd; and suddenly he view'd</a>
<a id='line_9476'>  The foes inclosing, and his friend pursued,</a>
<a id='line_9477'>  Forelaid and taken, while he strove in vain</a>
<a id='line_9478'>  The shelter of the friendly shades to gain.</a>
<a id='line_9479'>  What should he next attempt? what arms employ,</a>
<a id='line_9480'>  What fruitless force, to free the captive boy?</a>
<a id='line_9481'>  Or desperate should he rush and lose his life,</a>
<a id='line_9482'>  With odds oppress'd, in such unequal strife?</a>
<a id='line_9483'></a>
<a id='line_9484'>  Resolv'd at length, his pointed spear he shook;</a>
<a id='line_9485'>  And, casting on the moon a mournful look:</a>
<a id='line_9486'>  "Guardian of groves, and goddess of the night,</a>
<a id='line_9487'>  Fair queen," he said, "direct my dart aright.</a>
<a id='line_9488'>  If e'er my pious father, for my sake,</a>
<a id='line_9489'>  Did grateful off'rings on thy altars make,</a>
<a id='line_9490'>  Or I increas'd them with my sylvan toils,</a>
<a id='line_9491'>  And hung thy holy roofs with savage spoils,</a>
<a id='line_9492'>  Give me to scatter these." Then from his ear</a>
<a id='line_9493'>  He pois'd, and aim'd, and launch'd the trembling spear.</a>
<a id='line_9494'>  The deadly weapon, hissing from the grove,</a>
<a id='line_9495'>  Impetuous on the back of Sulmo drove;</a>
<a id='line_9496'>  Pierc'd his thin armor, drank his vital blood,</a>
<a id='line_9497'>  And in his body left the broken wood.</a>
<a id='line_9498'>  He staggers round; his eyeballs roll in death,</a>
<a id='line_9499'>  And with short sobs he gasps away his breath.</a>
<a id='line_9500'>  All stand amaz'd- a second jav'lin flies</a>
<a id='line_9501'>  With equal strength, and quivers thro' the skies.</a>
<a id='line_9502'>  This thro' thy temples, Tagus, forc'd the way,</a>
<a id='line_9503'>  And in the brainpan warmly buried lay.</a>
<a id='line_9504'>  Fierce Volscens foams with rage, and, gazing round,</a>
<a id='line_9505'>  Descried not him who gave the fatal wound,</a>
<a id='line_9506'>  Nor knew to fix revenge: "But thou," he cries,</a>
<a id='line_9507'>  "Shalt pay for both," and at the pris'ner flies</a>
<a id='line_9508'>  With his drawn sword. Then, struck with deep despair,</a>
<a id='line_9509'>  That cruel sight the lover could not bear;</a>
<a id='line_9510'>  But from his covert rush'd in open view,</a>
<a id='line_9511'>  And sent his voice before him as he flew:</a>
<a id='line_9512'>  "Me! me!" he cried- "turn all your swords alone</a>
<a id='line_9513'>  On me- the fact confess'd, the fault my own.</a>
<a id='line_9514'>  He neither could nor durst, the guiltless youth:</a>
<a id='line_9515'>  Ye moon and stars, bear witness to the truth!</a>
<a id='line_9516'>  His only crime (if friendship can offend)</a>
<a id='line_9517'>  Is too much love to his unhappy friend."</a>
<a id='line_9518'>  Too late he speaks: the sword, which fury guides,</a>
<a id='line_9519'>  Driv'n with full force, had pierc'd his tender sides.</a>
<a id='line_9520'>  Down fell the beauteous youth: the yawning wound</a>
<a id='line_9521'>  Gush'd out a purple stream, and stain'd the ground.</a>
<a id='line_9522'>  His snowy neck reclines upon his breast,</a>
<a id='line_9523'>  Like a fair flow'r by the keen share oppress'd;</a>
<a id='line_9524'>  Like a white poppy sinking on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_9525'>  Whose heavy head is overcharg'd with rain.</a>
<a id='line_9526'>  Despair, and rage, and vengeance justly vow'd,</a>
<a id='line_9527'>  Drove Nisus headlong on the hostile crowd.</a>
<a id='line_9528'>  Volscens he seeks; on him alone he bends:</a>
<a id='line_9529'>  Borne back and bor'd by his surrounding friends,</a>
<a id='line_9530'>  Onward he press'd, and kept him still in sight;</a>
<a id='line_9531'>  Then whirl'd aloft his sword with all his might:</a>
<a id='line_9532'>  Th' unerring steel descended while he spoke,</a>
<a id='line_9533'>  Piered his wide mouth, and thro' his weazon broke.</a>
<a id='line_9534'>  Dying, he slew; and, stagg'ring on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_9535'>  With swimming eyes he sought his lover slain;</a>
<a id='line_9536'>  Then quiet on his bleeding bosom fell,</a>
<a id='line_9537'>  Content, in death, to be reveng'd so well.</a>
<a id='line_9538'></a>
<a id='line_9539'>  O happy friends! for, if my verse can give</a>
<a id='line_9540'>  Immortal life, your fame shall ever live,</a>
<a id='line_9541'>  Fix'd as the Capitol's foundation lies,</a>
<a id='line_9542'>  And spread, where'er the Roman eagle flies!</a>
<a id='line_9543'></a>
<a id='line_9544'>  The conqu'ring party first divide the prey,</a>
<a id='line_9545'>  Then their slain leader to the camp convey.</a>
<a id='line_9546'>  With wonder, as they went, the troops were fill'd,</a>
<a id='line_9547'>  To see such numbers whom so few had kill'd.</a>
<a id='line_9548'>  Serranus, Rhamnes, and the rest, they found:</a>
<a id='line_9549'>  Vast crowds the dying and the dead surround;</a>
<a id='line_9550'>  And the yet reeking blood o'erflows the ground.</a>
<a id='line_9551'>  All knew the helmet which Messapus lost,</a>
<a id='line_9552'>  But mourn'd a purchase that so dear had cost.</a>
<a id='line_9553'>  Now rose the ruddy morn from Tithon's bed,</a>
<a id='line_9554'>  And with the dawn of day the skies o'erspread;</a>
<a id='line_9555'>  Nor long the sun his daily course withheld,</a>
<a id='line_9556'>  But added colors to the world reveal'd:</a>
<a id='line_9557'>  When early Turnus, wak'ning with the light,</a>
<a id='line_9558'>  All clad in armor, calls his troops to fight.</a>
<a id='line_9559'>  His martial men with fierce harangue he fir'd,</a>
<a id='line_9560'>  And his own ardor in their souls inspir'd.</a>
<a id='line_9561'>  This done- to give new terror to his foes,</a>
<a id='line_9562'>  The heads of Nisus and his friend he shows,</a>
<a id='line_9563'>  Rais'd high on pointed spears- a ghastly sight:</a>
<a id='line_9564'>  Loud peals of shouts ensue, and barbarous delight.</a>
<a id='line_9565'></a>
<a id='line_9566'>  Meantime the Trojans run, where danger calls;</a>
<a id='line_9567'>  They line their trenches, and they man their walls.</a>
<a id='line_9568'>  In front extended to the left they stood;</a>
<a id='line_9569'>  Safe was the right, surrounded by the flood.</a>
<a id='line_9570'>  But, casting from their tow'rs a frightful view,</a>
<a id='line_9571'>  They saw the faces, which too well they knew,</a>
<a id='line_9572'>  Tho' then disguis'd in death, and smear'd all o'er</a>
<a id='line_9573'>  With filth obscene, and dropping putrid gore.</a>
<a id='line_9574'>  Soon hasty fame thro' the sad city bears</a>
<a id='line_9575'>  The mournful message to the mother's ears.</a>
<a id='line_9576'>  An icy cold benumbs her limbs; she shakes;</a>
<a id='line_9577'>  Her cheeks the blood, her hand the web forsakes.</a>
<a id='line_9578'>  She runs the rampires round amidst the war,</a>
<a id='line_9579'>  Nor fears the flying darts; she rends her hair,</a>
<a id='line_9580'>  And fills with loud laments the liquid air.</a>
<a id='line_9581'>  "Thus, then, my lov'd Euryalus appears!</a>
<a id='line_9582'>  Thus looks the prop my declining years!</a>
<a id='line_9583'>  Was't on this face my famish'd eyes I fed?</a>
<a id='line_9584'>  Ah! how unlike the living is the dead!</a>
<a id='line_9585'>  And could'st thou leave me, cruel, thus alone?</a>
<a id='line_9586'>  Not one kind kiss from a departing son!</a>
<a id='line_9587'>  No look, no last adieu before he went,</a>
<a id='line_9588'>  In an ill-boding hour to slaughter sent!</a>
<a id='line_9589'>  Cold on the ground, and pressing foreign clay,</a>
<a id='line_9590'>  To Latian dogs and fowls he lies a prey!</a>
<a id='line_9591'>  Nor was I near to close his dying eyes,</a>
<a id='line_9592'>  To wash his wounds, to weep his obsequies,</a>
<a id='line_9593'>  To call about his corpse his crying friends,</a>
<a id='line_9594'>  Or spread the mantle (made for other ends)</a>
<a id='line_9595'>  On his dear body, which I wove with care,</a>
<a id='line_9596'>  Nor did my daily pains or nightly labor spare.</a>
<a id='line_9597'>  Where shall I find his corpse? what earth sustains</a>
<a id='line_9598'>  His trunk dismember'd, and his cold remains?</a>
<a id='line_9599'>  For this, alas! I left my needful ease,</a>
<a id='line_9600'>  Expos'd my life to winds and winter seas!</a>
<a id='line_9601'>  If any pity touch Rutulian hearts,</a>
<a id='line_9602'>  Here empty all your quivers, all your darts;</a>

<a id='line_9605'>  Her shrieks and clamors pierce the Trojans' ears,</a>
<a id='line_9606'>  Unman their courage, and augment their fears;</a>
<a id='line_9607'>  Nor young Ascanius could the sight sustain,</a>
<a id='line_9608'>  Nor old Ilioneus his tears restrain,</a>
<a id='line_9609'>  But Actor and Idaeus jointly sent,</a>

<a id='line_9611'></a>
<a id='line_9612'>  And now the trumpets terribly, from far,</a>
<a id='line_9613'>  With rattling clangor, rouse the sleepy war.</a>
<a id='line_9614'>  The soldiers' shouts succeed the brazen sounds;</a>
<a id='line_9615'>  And heav'n, from pole to pole, the noise rebounds.</a>
<a id='line_9616'>  The Volscians bear their shields upon their head,</a>
<a id='line_9617'>  And, rushing forward, form a moving shed.</a>
<a id='line_9618'>  These fill the ditch; those pull the bulwarks down:</a>
<a id='line_9619'>  Some raise the ladders; others scale the town.</a>
<a id='line_9620'>  But, where void spaces on the walls appear,</a>
<a id='line_9621'>  Or thin defense, they pour their forces there.</a>
<a id='line_9622'>  With poles and missive weapons, from afar,</a>
<a id='line_9623'>  The Trojans keep aloof the rising war.</a>
<a id='line_9624'>  Taught, by their ten years' siege, defensive fight,</a>
<a id='line_9625'>  They roll down ribs of rocks, an unresisted weight,</a>
<a id='line_9626'>  To break the penthouse with the pond'rous blow,</a>
<a id='line_9627'>  Which yet the patient Volscians undergo:</a>
<a id='line_9628'>  But could not bear th' unequal combat long;</a>
<a id='line_9629'>  For, where the Trojans find the thickest throng,</a>
<a id='line_9630'>  The ruin falls: their shatter'd shields give way,</a>
<a id='line_9631'>  And their crush'd heads become an easy prey.</a>
<a id='line_9632'>  They shrink for fear, abated of their rage,</a>
<a id='line_9633'>  Nor longer dare in a blind fight engage;</a>
<a id='line_9634'>  Contented now to gall them from below</a>
<a id='line_9635'>  With darts and slings, and with the distant bow.</a>
<a id='line_9636'></a>
<a id='line_9637'>  Elsewhere Mezentius, terrible to view,</a>
<a id='line_9638'>  A blazing pine within the trenches threw.</a>
<a id='line_9639'>  But brave Messapus, Neptune's warlike son,</a>
<a id='line_9640'>  Broke down the palisades, the trenches won,</a>
<a id='line_9641'>  And loud for ladders calls, to scale the town.</a>
<a id='line_9642'></a>
<a id='line_9643'>  Calliope, begin! Ye sacred Nine,</a>
<a id='line_9644'>  Inspire your poet in his high design,</a>
<a id='line_9645'>  To sing what slaughter manly Turnus made,</a>
<a id='line_9646'>  What souls he sent below the Stygian shade,</a>
<a id='line_9647'>  What fame the soldiers with their captain share,</a>
<a id='line_9648'>  And the vast circuit of the fatal war;</a>
<a id='line_9649'>  For you in singing martial facts excel;</a>
<a id='line_9650'>  You best remember, and alone can tell.</a>
<a id='line_9651'></a>
<a id='line_9652'>  There stood a tow'r, amazing to the sight,</a>
<a id='line_9653'>  Built up of beams, and of stupendous height:</a>
<a id='line_9654'>  Art, and the nature of the place, conspir'd</a>
<a id='line_9655'>  To furnish all the strength that war requir'd.</a>
<a id='line_9656'>  To level this, the bold Italians join;</a>
<a id='line_9657'>  The wary Trojans obviate their design;</a>
<a id='line_9658'>  With weighty stones o'erwhelm their troops below,</a>
<a id='line_9659'>  Shoot thro' the loopholes, and sharp jav'lins throw.</a>
<a id='line_9660'>  Turnus, the chief, toss'd from his thund'ring hand</a>
<a id='line_9661'>  Against the wooden walls, a flaming brand:</a>
<a id='line_9662'>  It stuck, the fiery plague; the winds were high;</a>
<a id='line_9663'>  The planks were season'd, and the timber dry.</a>
<a id='line_9664'>  Contagion caught the posts; it spread along,</a>
<a id='line_9665'>  Scorch'd, and to distance drove the scatter'd throng.</a>
<a id='line_9666'>  The Trojans fled; the fire pursued amain,</a>
<a id='line_9667'>  Still gath'ring fast upon the trembling train;</a>
<a id='line_9668'>  Till, crowding to the corners of the wall,</a>
<a id='line_9669'>  Down the defense and the defenders fall.</a>
<a id='line_9670'>  The mighty flaw makes heav'n itself resound:</a>
<a id='line_9671'>  The dead and dying Trojans strew the ground.</a>
<a id='line_9672'>  The tow'r, that follow'd on the fallen crew,</a>
<a id='line_9673'>  Whelm'd o'er their heads, and buried whom it slew:</a>
<a id='line_9674'>  Some stuck upon the darts themselves had sent;</a>
<a id='line_9675'>  All the same equal ruin underwent.</a>
<a id='line_9676'></a>
<a id='line_9677'>  Young Lycus and Helenor only scape;</a>
<a id='line_9678'>  Sav'd- how, they know not- from the steepy leap.</a>
<a id='line_9679'>  Helenor, elder of the two: by birth,</a>
<a id='line_9680'>  On one side royal, one a son of earth,</a>
<a id='line_9681'>  Whom to the Lydian king Licymnia bare,</a>
<a id='line_9682'>  And sent her boasted bastard to the war</a>
<a id='line_9683'>  (A privilege which none but freemen share).</a>
<a id='line_9684'>  Slight were his arms, a sword and silver shield:</a>
<a id='line_9685'>  No marks of honor charg'd its empty field.</a>
<a id='line_9686'>  Light as he fell, so light the youth arose,</a>
<a id='line_9687'>  And rising, found himself amidst his foes;</a>
<a id='line_9688'>  Nor flight was left, nor hopes to force his way.</a>
<a id='line_9689'>  Embolden'd by despair, he stood at bay;</a>
<a id='line_9690'>  And- like a stag, whom all the troop surrounds</a>
<a id='line_9691'>  Of eager huntsmen and invading hounds-</a>
<a id='line_9692'>  Resolv'd on death, he dissipates his fears,</a>
<a id='line_9693'>  And bounds aloft against the pointed spears:</a>
<a id='line_9694'>  So dares the youth, secure of death; and throws</a>
<a id='line_9695'>  His dying body on his thickest foes.</a>
<a id='line_9696'>  But Lycus, swifter of his feet by far,</a>
<a id='line_9697'>  Runs, doubles, winds and turns, amidst the war;</a>
<a id='line_9698'>  Springs to the walls, and leaves his foes behind,</a>
<a id='line_9699'>  And snatches at the beam he first can find;</a>
<a id='line_9700'>  Looks up, and leaps aloft at all the stretch,</a>
<a id='line_9701'>  In hopes the helping hand of some kind friend to reach.</a>
<a id='line_9702'>  But Turnus follow'd hard his hunted prey</a>
<a id='line_9703'>  (His spear had almost reach'd him in the way,</a>
<a id='line_9704'>  Short of his reins, and scarce a span behind)</a>
<a id='line_9705'>  "Fool!" said the chief, "tho' fleeter than the wind,</a>
<a id='line_9706'>  Couldst thou presume to scape, when I pursue?"</a>
<a id='line_9707'>  He said, and downward by the feet he drew</a>
<a id='line_9708'>  The trembling dastard; at the tug he falls;</a>
<a id='line_9709'>  Vast ruins come along, rent from the smoking walls.</a>
<a id='line_9710'>  Thus on some silver swan, or tim'rous hare,</a>
<a id='line_9711'>  Jove's bird comes sousing down from upper air;</a>
<a id='line_9712'>  Her crooked talons truss the fearful prey:</a>
<a id='line_9713'>  Then out of sight she soars, and wings her way.</a>
<a id='line_9714'>  So seizes the grim wolf the tender lamb,</a>
<a id='line_9715'>  In vain lamented by the bleating dam.</a>
<a id='line_9716'></a>
<a id='line_9717'>  Then rushing onward with a barb'rous cry,</a>
<a id='line_9718'>  The troops of Turnus to the combat fly.</a>
<a id='line_9719'>  The ditch with fagots fill'd, the daring foe</a>
<a id='line_9720'>  Toss'd firebrands to the steepy turrets throw.</a>
<a id='line_9721'></a>
<a id='line_9722'>  Ilioneus, as bold Lucetius came</a>
<a id='line_9723'>  To force the gate, and feed the kindling flame,</a>
<a id='line_9724'>  Roll'd down the fragment of a rock so right,</a>
<a id='line_9725'>  It crush'd him double underneath the weight.</a>
<a id='line_9726'>  Two more young Liger and Asylas slew:</a>
<a id='line_9727'>  To bend the bow young Liger better knew;</a>
<a id='line_9728'>  Asylas best the pointed jav'lin threw.</a>
<a id='line_9729'>  Brave Caeneus laid Ortygius on the plain;</a>
<a id='line_9730'>  The victor Caeneus was by Turnus slain.</a>
<a id='line_9731'>  By the same hand, Clonius and Itys fall,</a>
<a id='line_9732'>  Sagar, and Ida, standing on the wall.</a>
<a id='line_9733'>  From Capys' arms his fate Privernus found:</a>
<a id='line_9734'>  Hurt by Themilla first-but slight the wound-</a>
<a id='line_9735'>  His shield thrown by, to mitigate the smart,</a>
<a id='line_9736'>  He clapp'd his hand upon the wounded part:</a>
<a id='line_9737'>  The second shaft came swift and unespied,</a>
<a id='line_9738'>  And pierc'd his hand, and nail'd it to his side,</a>
<a id='line_9739'>  Transfix'd his breathing lungs and beating heart:</a>
<a id='line_9740'>  The soul came issuing out, and hiss'd against the dart.</a>
<a id='line_9741'></a>
<a id='line_9742'>  The son of Arcens shone amid the rest,</a>
<a id='line_9743'>  In glitt'ring armor and a purple vest,</a>
<a id='line_9744'>  (Fair was his face, his eyes inspiring love,)</a>
<a id='line_9745'>  Bred by his father in the Martian grove,</a>
<a id='line_9746'>  Where the fat altars of Palicus flame,</a>
<a id='line_9747'>  And send in arms to purchase early fame.</a>
<a id='line_9748'>  Him when he spied from far, the Tuscan king</a>
<a id='line_9749'>  Laid by the lance, and took him to the sling,</a>
<a id='line_9750'>  Thrice whirl'd the thong around his head, and threw:</a>
<a id='line_9751'>  The heated lead half melted as it flew;</a>
<a id='line_9752'>  It pierc'd his hollow temples and his brain;</a>
<a id='line_9753'>  The youth came tumbling down, and spurn'd the plain.</a>
<a id='line_9754'></a>
<a id='line_9755'>  Then young Ascanius, who, before this day,</a>
<a id='line_9756'>  Was wont in woods to shoot the savage prey,</a>
<a id='line_9757'>  First bent in martial strife the twanging bow,</a>
<a id='line_9758'>  And exercis'd against a human foe-</a>
<a id='line_9759'>  With this bereft Numanus of his life,</a>
<a id='line_9760'>  Who Turnus' younger sister took to wife.</a>
<a id='line_9761'>  Proud of his realm, and of his royal bride,</a>
<a id='line_9762'>  Vaunting before his troops, and lengthen'd with a stride,</a>
<a id='line_9763'>  In these insulting terms the Trojans he defied:</a>
<a id='line_9764'></a>
<a id='line_9765'>  "Twice-conquer'd cowards, now your shame is shown-</a>
<a id='line_9766'>  Coop'd up a second time within your town!</a>
<a id='line_9767'>  Who dare not issue forth in open field,</a>
<a id='line_9768'>  But hold your walls before you for a shield.</a>
<a id='line_9769'>  Thus threat you war? thus our alliance force?</a>
<a id='line_9770'>  What gods, what madness, hether steer'd your course?</a>
<a id='line_9771'>  You shall not find the sons of Atreus here,</a>
<a id='line_9772'>  Nor need the frauds of sly Ulysses fear.</a>
<a id='line_9773'>  Strong from the cradle, of a sturdy brood,</a>
<a id='line_9774'>  We bear our newborn infants to the flood;</a>
<a id='line_9775'>  There bath'd amid the stream, our boys we hold,</a>
<a id='line_9776'>  With winter harden'd, and inur'd to cold.</a>
<a id='line_9777'>  They wake before the day to range the wood,</a>
<a id='line_9778'>  Kill ere they eat, nor taste unconquer'd food.</a>
<a id='line_9779'>  No sports, but what belong to war, they know:</a>
<a id='line_9780'>  To break the stubborn colt, to bend the bow.</a>
<a id='line_9781'>  Our youth, of labor patient, earn their bread;</a>
<a id='line_9782'>  Hardly they work, with frugal diet fed.</a>
<a id='line_9783'>  From plows and harrows sent to seek renown,</a>
<a id='line_9784'>  They fight in fields, and storm the shaken town.</a>
<a id='line_9785'>  No part of life from toils of war is free,</a>
<a id='line_9786'>  No change in age, or diff'rence in degree.</a>
<a id='line_9787'>  We plow and till in arms; our oxen feel,</a>
<a id='line_9788'>  Instead of goads, the spur and pointed steel;</a>
<a id='line_9789'>  Th' inverted lance makes furrows in the plain.</a>
<a id='line_9790'>  Ev'n time, that changes all, yet changes us in vain:</a>
<a id='line_9791'>  The body, not the mind; nor can control</a>
<a id='line_9792'>  Th' immortal vigor, or abate the soul.</a>
<a id='line_9793'>  Our helms defend the young, disguise the gray:</a>
<a id='line_9794'>  We live by plunder, and delight in prey.</a>
<a id='line_9795'>  Your vests embroider'd with rich purple shine;</a>
<a id='line_9796'>  In sloth you glory, and in dances join.</a>
<a id='line_9797'>  Your vests have sweeping sleeves; with female pride</a>
<a id='line_9798'>  Your turbants underneath your chins are tied.</a>
<a id='line_9799'>  Go, Phrygians, to your Dindymus again!</a>
<a id='line_9800'>  Go, less than women, in the shapes of men!</a>
<a id='line_9801'>  Go, mix'd with eunuchs, in the Mother's rites,</a>
<a id='line_9802'>  Where with unequal sound the flute invites;</a>
<a id='line_9803'>  Sing, dance, and howl, by turns, in Ida's shade:</a>
<a id='line_9804'>  Resign the war to men, who know the martial trade!"</a>
<a id='line_9805'></a>
<a id='line_9806'>  This foul reproach Ascanius could not hear</a>
<a id='line_9807'>  With patience, or a vow'd revenge forbear.</a>
<a id='line_9808'>  At the full stretch of both his hands he drew,</a>
<a id='line_9809'>  And almost join'd the horns of the tough yew.</a>
<a id='line_9810'>  But, first, before the throne of Jove he stood,</a>
<a id='line_9811'>  And thus with lifted hands invok'd the god:</a>
<a id='line_9812'>  "My first attempt, great Jupiter, succeed!</a>
<a id='line_9813'>  An annual off'ring in thy grove shall bleed;</a>
<a id='line_9814'>  A snow-white steer, before thy altar led,</a>

<a id='line_9816'>  Butts with his threat'ning brows, and bellowing stands,</a>
<a id='line_9817'>  And dares the fight, and spurns the yellow sands."</a>
<a id='line_9818'></a>
<a id='line_9819'>  Jove bow'd the heav'ns, and lent a gracious ear,</a>
<a id='line_9820'>  And thunder'd on the left, amidst the clear.</a>
<a id='line_9821'>  Sounded at once the bow; and swiftly flies</a>
<a id='line_9822'>  The feather'd death, and hisses thro' the skies.</a>
<a id='line_9823'>  The steel thro' both his temples forc'd the way:</a>
<a id='line_9824'>  Extended on the ground, Numanus lay.</a>
<a id='line_9825'>  "Go now, vain boaster, and true valor scorn!</a>
<a id='line_9826'>  The Phrygians, twice subdued, yet make this third return."</a>
<a id='line_9827'>  Ascanius said no more. The Trojans shake</a>
<a id='line_9828'>  The heav'ns with shouting, and new vigor take.</a>
<a id='line_9829'></a>
<a id='line_9830'>  Apollo then bestrode a golden cloud,</a>
<a id='line_9831'>  To view the feats of arms, and fighting crowd;</a>
<a id='line_9832'>  And thus the beardless victor he bespoke aloud:</a>
<a id='line_9833'>  "Advance, illustrious youth, increase in fame,</a>
<a id='line_9834'>  And wide from east to west extend thy name;</a>
<a id='line_9835'>  Offspring of gods thyself; and Rome shall owe</a>
<a id='line_9836'>  To thee a race of demigods below.</a>
<a id='line_9837'>  This is the way to heav'n: the pow'rs divine</a>
<a id='line_9838'>  From this beginning date the Julian line.</a>
<a id='line_9839'>  To thee, to them, and their victorious heirs,</a>
<a id='line_9840'>  The conquer'd war is due, and the vast world is theirs.</a>
<a id='line_9841'>  Troy is too narrow for thy name." He said,</a>
<a id='line_9842'>  And plunging downward shot his radiant head;</a>
<a id='line_9843'>  Dispell'd the breathing air, that broke his flight:</a>
<a id='line_9844'>  Shorn of his beams, a man to mortal sight.</a>
<a id='line_9845'>  Old Butes' form he took, Anchises' squire,</a>
<a id='line_9846'>  Now left, to rule Ascanius, by his sire:</a>
<a id='line_9847'>  His wrinkled visage, and his hoary hairs,</a>
<a id='line_9848'>  His mien, his habit, and his arms, he wears,</a>
<a id='line_9849'>  And thus salutes the boy, too forward for his years:</a>
<a id='line_9850'>  "Suffice it thee, thy father's worthy son,</a>
<a id='line_9851'>  The warlike prize thou hast already won.</a>
<a id='line_9852'>  The god of archers gives thy youth a part</a>
<a id='line_9853'>  Of his own praise, nor envies equal art.</a>
<a id='line_9854'>  Now tempt the war no more." He said, and flew</a>
<a id='line_9855'>  Obscure in air, and vanish'd from their view.</a>
<a id='line_9856'>  The Trojans, by his arms, their patron know,</a>
<a id='line_9857'>  And hear the twanging of his heav'nly bow.</a>
<a id='line_9858'>  Then duteous force they use, and Phoebus' name,</a>
<a id='line_9859'>  To keep from fight the youth too fond of fame.</a>
<a id='line_9860'>  Undaunted, they themselves no danger shun;</a>
<a id='line_9861'>  From wall to wall the shouts and clamors run.</a>
<a id='line_9862'>  They bend their bows; they whirl their slings around;</a>
<a id='line_9863'>  Heaps of spent arrows fall, and strew the ground;</a>
<a id='line_9864'>  And helms, and shields, and rattling arms resound.</a>
<a id='line_9865'>  The combat thickens, like the storm that flies</a>
<a id='line_9866'>  From westward, when the show'ry Kids arise;</a>
<a id='line_9867'>  Or patt'ring hail comes pouring on the main,</a>
<a id='line_9868'>  When Jupiter descends in harden'd rain,</a>
<a id='line_9869'>  Or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound,</a>
<a id='line_9870'>  And with an armed winter strew the ground.</a>
<a id='line_9871'></a>
<a id='line_9872'>  Pand'rus and Bitias, thunderbolts of war,</a>
<a id='line_9873'>  Whom Hiera to bold Alcanor bare</a>
<a id='line_9874'>  On Ida's top, two youths of height and size</a>
<a id='line_9875'>  Like firs that on their mother mountain rise,</a>
<a id='line_9876'>  Presuming on their force, the gates unbar,</a>
<a id='line_9877'>  And of their own accord invite the war.</a>
<a id='line_9878'>  With fates averse, against their king's command,</a>
<a id='line_9879'>  Arm'd, on the right and on the left they stand,</a>
<a id='line_9880'>  And flank the passage: shining steel they wear,</a>
<a id='line_9881'>  And waving crests above their heads appear.</a>
<a id='line_9882'>  Thus two tall oaks, that Padus' banks adorn,</a>
<a id='line_9883'>  Lift up to heav'n their leafy heads unshorn,</a>
<a id='line_9884'>  And, overpress'd with nature's heavy load,</a>
<a id='line_9885'>  Dance to the whistling winds, and at each other nod.</a>
<a id='line_9886'>  In flows a tide of Latians, when they see</a>
<a id='line_9887'>  The gate set open, and the passage free;</a>
<a id='line_9888'>  Bold Quercens, with rash Tmarus, rushing on,</a>
<a id='line_9889'>  Equicolus, that in bright armor shone,</a>
<a id='line_9890'>  And Haemon first; but soon repuls'd they fly,</a>
<a id='line_9891'>  Or in the well-defended pass they die.</a>
<a id='line_9892'>  These with success are fir'd, and those with rage,</a>
<a id='line_9893'>  And each on equal terms at length ingage.</a>
<a id='line_9894'>  Drawn from their lines, and issuing on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_9895'>  The Trojans hand to hand the fight maintain.</a>
<a id='line_9896'></a>
<a id='line_9897'>  Fierce Turnus in another quarter fought,</a>
<a id='line_9898'>  When suddenly th' unhop'd-for news was brought,</a>
<a id='line_9899'>  The foes had left the fastness of their place,</a>
<a id='line_9900'>  Prevail'd in fight, and had his men in chase.</a>
<a id='line_9901'>  He quits th' attack, and, to prevent their fate,</a>
<a id='line_9902'>  Runs where the giant brothers guard the gate.</a>
<a id='line_9903'>  The first he met, Antiphates the brave,</a>
<a id='line_9904'>  But base-begotten on a Theban slave,</a>
<a id='line_9905'>  Sarpedon's son, he slew: the deadly dart</a>
<a id='line_9906'>  Found passage thro' his breast, and pierc'd his heart.</a>
<a id='line_9907'>  Fix'd in the wound th' Italian cornel stood,</a>
<a id='line_9908'>  Warm'd in his lungs, and in his vital blood.</a>
<a id='line_9909'>  Aphidnus next, and Erymanthus dies,</a>
<a id='line_9910'>  And Meropes, and the gigantic size</a>
<a id='line_9911'>  Of Bitias, threat'ning with his ardent eyes.</a>
<a id='line_9912'>  Not by the feeble dart he fell oppress'd</a>
<a id='line_9913'>  (A dart were lost within that roomy breast),</a>
<a id='line_9914'>  But from a knotted lance, large, heavy, strong,</a>
<a id='line_9915'>  Which roar'd like thunder as it whirl'd along:</a>
<a id='line_9916'>  Not two bull hides th' impetuous force withhold,</a>
<a id='line_9917'>  Nor coat of double mail, with scales of gold.</a>
<a id='line_9918'>  Down sunk the monster bulk and press'd the ground;</a>
<a id='line_9919'>  His arms and clatt'ring shield on the vast body sound,</a>
<a id='line_9920'>  Not with less ruin than the Bajan mole,</a>
<a id='line_9921'>  Rais'd on the seas, the surges to control-</a>
<a id='line_9922'>  At once comes tumbling down the rocky wall;</a>
<a id='line_9923'>  Prone to the deep, the stones disjointed fall</a>
<a id='line_9924'>  Of the vast pile; the scatter'd ocean flies;</a>
<a id='line_9925'>  Black sands, discolor'd froth, and mingled mud arise:</a>
<a id='line_9926'>  The frighted billows roll, and seek the shores;</a>
<a id='line_9927'>  Then trembles Prochyta, then Ischia roars:</a>
<a id='line_9928'>  Typhoeus, thrown beneath, by Jove's command,</a>
<a id='line_9929'>  Astonish'd at the flaw that shakes the land,</a>
<a id='line_9930'>  Soon shifts his weary side, and, scarce awake,</a>
<a id='line_9931'>  With wonder feels the weight press lighter on his back.</a>
<a id='line_9932'></a>
<a id='line_9933'>  The warrior god the Latian troops inspir'd,</a>
<a id='line_9934'>  New strung their sinews, and their courage fir'd,</a>
<a id='line_9935'>  But chills the Trojan hearts with cold affright:</a>
<a id='line_9936'>  Then black despair precipitates their flight.</a>
<a id='line_9937'></a>
<a id='line_9938'>  When Pandarus beheld his brother kill'd,</a>
<a id='line_9939'>  The town with fear and wild confusion fill'd,</a>
<a id='line_9940'>  He turns the hinges of the heavy gate</a>
<a id='line_9941'>  With both his hands, and adds his shoulders to the weight</a>
<a id='line_9942'>  Some happier friends within the walls inclos'd;</a>
<a id='line_9943'>  The rest shut out, to certain death expos'd:</a>
<a id='line_9944'>  Fool as he was, and frantic in his care,</a>
<a id='line_9945'>  T' admit young Turnus, and include the war!</a>
<a id='line_9946'>  He thrust amid the crowd, securely bold,</a>
<a id='line_9947'>  Like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold.</a>
<a id='line_9948'>  Too late his blazing buckler they descry,</a>
<a id='line_9949'>  And sparkling fires that shot from either eye,</a>
<a id='line_9950'>  His mighty members, and his ample breast,</a>
<a id='line_9951'>  His rattling armor, and his crimson crest.</a>
<a id='line_9952'></a>
<a id='line_9953'>  Far from that hated face the Trojans fly,</a>
<a id='line_9954'>  All but the fool who sought his destiny.</a>
<a id='line_9955'>  Mad Pandarus steps forth, with vengeance vow'd</a>
<a id='line_9956'>  For Bitias' death, and threatens thus aloud:</a>
<a id='line_9957'>  "These are not Ardea's walls, nor this the town</a>
<a id='line_9958'>  Amata proffers with Lavinia's crown:</a>
<a id='line_9959'>  'T is hostile earth you tread. Of hope bereft,</a>
<a id='line_9960'>  No means of safe return by flight are left."</a>
<a id='line_9961'>  To whom, with count'nance calm, and soul sedate,</a>
<a id='line_9962'>  Thus Turnus: "Then begin, and try thy fate:</a>
<a id='line_9963'>  My message to the ghost of Priam bear;</a>
<a id='line_9964'>  Tell him a new Achilles sent thee there."</a>
<a id='line_9965'></a>
<a id='line_9966'>  A lance of tough ground ash the Trojan threw,</a>
<a id='line_9967'>  Rough in the rind, and knotted as it grew:</a>
<a id='line_9968'>  With his full force he whirl'd it first around;</a>
<a id='line_9969'>  But the soft yielding air receiv'd the wound:</a>
<a id='line_9970'>  Imperial Juno turn'd the course before,</a>
<a id='line_9971'>  And fix'd the wand'ring weapon in the door.</a>
<a id='line_9972'></a>
<a id='line_9973'>  "But hope not thou," said Turnus, "when I strike,</a>
<a id='line_9974'>  To shun thy fate: our force is not alike,</a>
<a id='line_9975'>  Nor thy steel temper'd by the Lemnian god."</a>
<a id='line_9976'>  Then rising, on his utmost stretch he stood,</a>
<a id='line_9977'>  And aim'd from high: the full descending blow</a>
<a id='line_9978'>  Cleaves the broad front and beardless cheeks in two.</a>
<a id='line_9979'>  Down sinks the giant with a thund'ring sound:</a>
<a id='line_9980'>  His pond'rous limbs oppress the trembling ground;</a>
<a id='line_9981'>  Blood, brains, and foam gush from the gaping wound:</a>
<a id='line_9982'>  Scalp, face, and shoulders the keen steel divides,</a>
<a id='line_9983'>  And the shar'd visage hangs on equal sides.</a>
<a id='line_9984'>  The Trojans fly from their approaching fate;</a>
<a id='line_9985'>  And, had the victor then secur'd the gate,</a>
<a id='line_9986'>  And to his troops without unclos'd the bars,</a>
<a id='line_9987'>  One lucky day had ended all his wars.</a>
<a id='line_9988'>  But boiling youth, and blind desire of blood,</a>
<a id='line_9989'>  Push'd on his fury, to pursue the crowd.</a>
<a id='line_9990'>  Hamstring'd behind, unhappy Gyges died;</a>
<a id='line_9991'>  Then Phalaris is added to his side.</a>
<a id='line_9992'>  The pointed jav'lins from the dead he drew,</a>
<a id='line_9993'>  And their friends' arms against their fellows threw.</a>
<a id='line_9994'>  Strong Halys stands in vain; weak Phlegys flies;</a>
<a id='line_9995'>  Saturnia, still at hand, new force and fire supplies.</a>
<a id='line_9996'>  Then Halius, Prytanis, Alcander fall-</a>
<a id='line_9997'>  Ingag'd against the foes who scal'd the wall:</a>
<a id='line_9998'>  But, whom they fear'd without, they found within.</a>
<a id='line_9999'>  At last, tho' late, by Lynceus he was seen.</a>
<a id='line_10000'>  He calls new succors, and assaults the prince:</a>
<a id='line_10001'>  But weak his force, and vain is their defense.</a>
<a id='line_10002'>  Turn'd to the right, his sword the hero drew,</a>
<a id='line_10003'>  And at one blow the bold aggressor slew.</a>
<a id='line_10004'>  He joints the neck; and, with a stroke so strong,</a>
<a id='line_10005'>  The helm flies off, and bears the head along.</a>
<a id='line_10006'>  Next him, the huntsman Amycus he kill'd,</a>
<a id='line_10007'>  In darts invenom'd and in poison skill'd.</a>
<a id='line_10008'>  Then Clytius fell beneath his fatal spear,</a>
<a id='line_10009'>  And Creteus, whom the Muses held so dear:</a>
<a id='line_10010'>  He fought with courage, and he sung the fight;</a>
<a id='line_10011'>  Arms were his bus'ness, verses his delight.</a>
<a id='line_10012'></a>
<a id='line_10013'>  The Trojan chiefs behold, with rage and grief,</a>
<a id='line_10014'>  Their slaughter'd friends, and hasten their relief.</a>
<a id='line_10015'>  Bold Mnestheus rallies first the broken train,</a>
<a id='line_10016'>  Whom brave Seresthus and his troop sustain.</a>
<a id='line_10017'>  To save the living, and revenge the dead,</a>
<a id='line_10018'>  Against one warrior's arms all Troy they led.</a>
<a id='line_10019'>  "O, void of sense and courage!" Mnestheus cried,</a>
<a id='line_10020'>  "Where can you hope your coward heads to hide?</a>
<a id='line_10021'>  Ah! where beyond these rampires can you run?</a>
<a id='line_10022'>  One man, and in your camp inclos'd, you shun!</a>
<a id='line_10023'>  Shall then a single sword such slaughter boast,</a>
<a id='line_10024'>  And pass unpunish'd from a num'rous host?</a>
<a id='line_10025'>  Forsaking honor, and renouncing fame,</a>
<a id='line_10026'>  Your gods, your country, and your king you shame!"</a>
<a id='line_10027'>  This just reproach their virtue does excite:</a>
<a id='line_10028'>  They stand, they join, they thicken to the fight.</a>
<a id='line_10029'></a>
<a id='line_10030'>  Now Turnus doubts, and yet disdains to yield,</a>
<a id='line_10031'>  But with slow paces measures back the field,</a>
<a id='line_10032'>  And inches to the walls, where Tiber's tide,</a>
<a id='line_10033'>  Washing the camp, defends the weaker side.</a>
<a id='line_10034'>  The more he loses, they advance the more,</a>
<a id='line_10035'>  And tread in ev'ry step he trod before.</a>
<a id='line_10036'>  They shout: they bear him back; and, whom by might</a>
<a id='line_10037'>  They cannot conquer, they oppress with weight.</a>
<a id='line_10038'></a>
<a id='line_10039'>  As, compass'd with a wood of spears around,</a>
<a id='line_10040'>  The lordly lion still maintains his ground;</a>
<a id='line_10041'>  Grins horrible, retires, and turns again;</a>
<a id='line_10042'>  Threats his distended paws, and shakes his mane;</a>
<a id='line_10043'>  He loses while in vain he presses on,</a>
<a id='line_10044'>  Nor will his courage let him dare to run:</a>
<a id='line_10045'>  So Turnus fares, and, unresolved of flight,</a>
<a id='line_10046'>  Moves tardy back, and just recedes from fight.</a>
<a id='line_10047'>  Yet twice, inrag'd, the combat he renews,</a>
<a id='line_10048'>  Twice breaks, and twice his broken foes pursues.</a>
<a id='line_10049'>  But now they swarm, and, with fresh troops supplied,</a>
<a id='line_10050'>  Come rolling on, and rush from ev'ry side:</a>
<a id='line_10051'>  Nor Juno, who sustain'd his arms before,</a>
<a id='line_10052'>  Dares with new strength suffice th' exhausted store;</a>
<a id='line_10053'>  For Jove, with sour commands, sent Iris down,</a>
<a id='line_10054'>  To force th' invader from the frighted town.</a>
<a id='line_10055'></a>
<a id='line_10056'>  With labor spent, no longer can he wield</a>
<a id='line_10057'>  The heavy fanchion, or sustain the shield,</a>
<a id='line_10058'>  O'erwhelm'd with darts, which from afar they fling:</a>
<a id='line_10059'>  The weapons round his hollow temples ring;</a>
<a id='line_10060'>  His golden helm gives way, with stony blows</a>
<a id='line_10061'>  Batter'd, and flat, and beaten to his brows.</a>
<a id='line_10062'>  His crest is rash'd away; his ample shield</a>
<a id='line_10063'>  Is falsified, and round with jav'lins fill'd.</a>
<a id='line_10064'></a>
<a id='line_10065'>  The foe, now faint, the Trojans overwhelm;</a>
<a id='line_10066'>  And Mnestheus lays hard load upon his helm.</a>
<a id='line_10067'>  Sick sweat succeeds; he drops at ev'ry pore;</a>
<a id='line_10068'>  With driving dust his cheeks are pasted o'er;</a>
<a id='line_10069'>  Shorter and shorter ev'ry gasp he takes;</a>
<a id='line_10070'>  And vain efforts and hurtless blows he makes.</a>
<a id='line_10071'>  Plung'd in the flood, and made the waters fly.</a>
<a id='line_10072'>  The yellow god the welcome burthen bore,</a>
<a id='line_10073'>  And wip'd the sweat, and wash'd away the gore;</a>
<a id='line_10074'>  Then gently wafts him to the farther coast,</a>

<a id='line_10418'>  Cymodoce, whose voice excell'd the rest,</a>
<a id='line_10419'>  Above the waves advanc'd her snowy breast;</a>
<a id='line_10420'>  Her right hand stops the stern; her left divides</a>
<a id='line_10421'>  The curling ocean, and corrects the tides.</a>
<a id='line_10422'>  She spoke for all the choir, and thus began</a>
<a id='line_10423'>  With pleasing words to warn th' unknowing man:</a>
<a id='line_10424'>  "Sleeps our lov'd lord? O goddess-born, awake!</a>
<a id='line_10425'>  Spread ev'ry sail, pursue your wat'ry track,</a>
<a id='line_10426'>  And haste your course. Your navy once were we,</a>
<a id='line_10427'>  From Ida's height descending to the sea;</a>
<a id='line_10428'>  Till Turnus, as at anchor fix'd we stood,</a>
<a id='line_10429'>  Presum'd to violate our holy wood.</a>
<a id='line_10430'>  Then, loos'd from shore, we fled his fires profane</a>
<a id='line_10431'>  (Unwillingly we broke our master's chain),</a>
<a id='line_10432'>  And since have sought you thro' the Tuscan main.</a>
<a id='line_10433'>  The mighty Mother chang'd our forms to these,</a>
<a id='line_10434'>  And gave us life immortal in the seas.</a>
<a id='line_10435'>  But young Ascanius, in his camp distress'd,</a>
<a id='line_10436'>  By your insulting foes is hardly press'd.</a>
<a id='line_10437'>  Th' Arcadian horsemen, and Etrurian host,</a>
<a id='line_10438'>  Advance in order on the Latian coast:</a>
<a id='line_10439'>  To cut their way the Daunian chief designs,</a>
<a id='line_10440'>  Before their troops can reach the Trojan lines.</a>
<a id='line_10441'>  Thou, when the rosy morn restores the light,</a>
<a id='line_10442'>  First arm thy soldiers for th' ensuing fight:</a>
<a id='line_10443'>  Thyself the fated sword of Vulcan wield,</a>
<a id='line_10444'>  And bear aloft th' impenetrable shield.</a>
<a id='line_10445'>  To-morrow's sun, unless my skill be vain,</a>
<a id='line_10446'>  Shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain."</a>
<a id='line_10447'>  Parting, she spoke; and with immortal force</a>
<a id='line_10448'>  Push'd on the vessel in her wat'ry course;</a>
<a id='line_10449'>  For well she knew the way. Impell'd behind,</a>
<a id='line_10450'>  The ship flew forward, and outstripp'd the wind.</a>
<a id='line_10451'>  The rest make up. Unknowing of the cause,</a>
<a id='line_10452'>  The chief admires their speed, and happy omens draws.</a>
<a id='line_10453'></a>
<a id='line_10454'>  Then thus he pray'd, and fix'd on heav'n his eyes:</a>
<a id='line_10455'>  "Hear thou, great Mother of the deities.</a>
<a id='line_10456'>  With turrets crown'd! (on Ida's holy hill</a>
<a id='line_10457'>  Fierce tigers, rein'd and curb'd, obey thy will.)</a>
<a id='line_10458'>  Firm thy own omens; lead us on to fight;</a>
<a id='line_10459'>  And let thy Phrygians conquer in thy right."</a>
<a id='line_10460'></a>
<a id='line_10461'>  He said no more. And now renewing day</a>
<a id='line_10462'>  Had chas'd the shadows of the night away.</a>
<a id='line_10463'>  He charg'd the soldiers, with preventing care,</a>
<a id='line_10464'>  Their flags to follow, and their arms prepare;</a>
<a id='line_10465'>  Warn'd of th' ensuing fight, and bade 'em hope the war.</a>
<a id='line_10466'>  Now, his lofty poop, he view'd below</a>
<a id='line_10467'>  His camp incompass'd, and th' inclosing foe.</a>
<a id='line_10468'>  His blazing shield, imbrac'd, he held on high;</a>
<a id='line_10469'>  The camp receive the sign, and with loud shouts reply.</a>
<a id='line_10470'>  Hope arms their courage: from their tow'rs they throw</a>
<a id='line_10471'>  Their darts with double force, and drive the foe.</a>
<a id='line_10472'>  Thus, at the signal giv'n, the cranes arise</a>
<a id='line_10473'>  Before the stormy south, and blacken all the skies.</a>
<a id='line_10474'></a>
<a id='line_10475'>  King Turnus wonder'd at the fight renew'd,</a>
<a id='line_10476'>  Till, looking back, the Trojan fleet he view'd,</a>
<a id='line_10477'>  The seas with swelling canvas cover'd o'er,</a>
<a id='line_10478'>  And the swift ships descending on the shore.</a>
<a id='line_10479'>  The Latians saw from far, with dazzled eyes,</a>
<a id='line_10480'>  The radiant crest that seem'd in flames to rise,</a>
<a id='line_10481'>  And dart diffusive fires around the field,</a>
<a id='line_10482'>  And the keen glitt'ring of the golden shield.</a>
<a id='line_10483'>  Thus threat'ning comets, when by night they rise,</a>
<a id='line_10484'>  Shoot sanguine streams, and sadden all the skies:</a>
<a id='line_10485'>  So Sirius, flashing forth sinister lights,</a>
<a id='line_10486'>  Pale humankind with plagues and with dry famine fright:</a>
<a id='line_10487'></a>
<a id='line_10488'>  Yet Turnus with undaunted mind is bent</a>
<a id='line_10489'>  To man the shores, and hinder their descent,</a>
<a id='line_10490'>  And thus awakes the courage of his friends:</a>
<a id='line_10491'>  "What you so long have wish'd, kind Fortune sends;</a>
<a id='line_10492'>  In ardent arms to meet th' invading foe:</a>
<a id='line_10493'>  You find, and find him at advantage now.</a>
<a id='line_10494'>  Yours is the day: you need but only dare;</a>
<a id='line_10495'>  Your swords will make you masters of the war.</a>
<a id='line_10496'>  Your sires, your sons, your houses, and your lands,</a>
<a id='line_10497'>  And dearest wifes, are all within your hands.</a>
<a id='line_10498'>  Be mindful of the race from whence you came,</a>
<a id='line_10499'>  And emulate in arms your fathers' fame.</a>
<a id='line_10500'>  Now take the time, while stagg'ring yet they stand</a>
<a id='line_10501'>  With feet unfirm, and prepossess the strand:</a>
<a id='line_10502'>  Fortune befriends the bold." Nor more he said,</a>
<a id='line_10503'>  But balanc'd whom to leave, and whom to lead;</a>
<a id='line_10504'>  Then these elects, the landing to prevent;</a>
<a id='line_10505'>  And those he leaves, to keep the city pent.</a>
<a id='line_10506'></a>
<a id='line_10507'>  Meantime the Trojan sends his troops ashore:</a>
<a id='line_10508'>  Some are by boats expos'd, by bridges more.</a>
<a id='line_10509'>  With lab'ring oars they bear along the strand,</a>
<a id='line_10510'>  Where the tide languishes, and leap aland.</a>
<a id='line_10511'>  Tarchon observes the coast with careful eyes,</a>
<a id='line_10512'>  And, where no ford he finds, no water fries,</a>
<a id='line_10513'>  Nor billows with unequal murmurs roar,</a>
<a id='line_10514'>  But smoothly slide along, and swell the shore,</a>
<a id='line_10515'>  That course he steer'd, and thus he gave command:</a>
<a id='line_10516'>  "Here ply your oars, and at all hazard land:</a>
<a id='line_10517'>  Force on the vessel, that her keel may wound</a>
<a id='line_10518'>  This hated soil, and furrow hostile ground.</a>
<a id='line_10519'>  Let me securely land- I ask no more;</a>
<a id='line_10520'>  Then sink my ships, or shatter on the shore."</a>
<a id='line_10521'></a>
<a id='line_10522'>  This fiery speech inflames his fearful friends:</a>
<a id='line_10523'>  They tug at ev'ry oar, and ev'ry stretcher bends;</a>
<a id='line_10524'>  They run their ships aground; the vessels knock,</a>
<a id='line_10525'>  (Thus forc'd ashore,) and tremble with the shock.</a>
<a id='line_10526'>  Tarchon's alone was lost, that stranded stood,</a>
<a id='line_10527'>  Stuck on a bank, and beaten by the flood:</a>
<a id='line_10528'>  She breaks her back; the loosen'd sides give way,</a>
<a id='line_10529'>  And plunge the Tuscan soldiers in the sea.</a>
<a id='line_10530'>  Their broken oars and floating planks withstand</a>
<a id='line_10531'>  Their passage, while they labor to the land,</a>
<a id='line_10532'>  And ebbing tides bear back upon th' uncertain sand.</a>
<a id='line_10533'></a>
<a id='line_10534'>  Now Turnus leads his troops without delay,</a>
<a id='line_10535'>  Advancing to the margin of the sea.</a>
<a id='line_10536'>  The trumpets sound: Aeneas first assail'd</a>
<a id='line_10537'>  The clowns new-rais'd and raw, and soon prevail'd.</a>
<a id='line_10538'>  Great Theron fell, an omen of the fight;</a>
<a id='line_10539'>  Great Theron, large of limbs, of giant height.</a>
<a id='line_10540'>  He first in open field defied the prince:</a>
<a id='line_10541'>  But armor scal'd with gold was no defense</a>
<a id='line_10542'>  Against the fated sword, which open'd wide</a>
<a id='line_10543'>  His plated shield, and pierc'd his naked side.</a>
<a id='line_10544'>  Next, Lichas fell, who, not like others born,</a>
<a id='line_10545'>  Was from his wretched mother ripp'd and torn;</a>
<a id='line_10546'>  Sacred, O Phoebus, from his birth to thee;</a>
<a id='line_10547'>  For his beginning life from biting steel was free.</a>
<a id='line_10548'>  Not far from him was Gyas laid along,</a>
<a id='line_10549'>  Of monstrous bulk; with Cisseus fierce and strong:</a>
<a id='line_10550'>  Vain bulk and strength! for, when the chief assail'd,</a>
<a id='line_10551'>  Nor valor nor Herculean arms avail'd,</a>
<a id='line_10552'>  Nor their fam'd father, wont in war to go</a>
<a id='line_10553'>  With great Alcides, while he toil'd below.</a>
<a id='line_10554'>  The noisy Pharos next receiv'd his death:</a>
<a id='line_10555'>  Aeneas writh'd his dart, and stopp'd his bawling breath.</a>
<a id='line_10556'>  Then wretched Cydon had receiv'd his doom,</a>
<a id='line_10557'>  Who courted Clytius in his beardless bloom,</a>
<a id='line_10558'>  And sought with lust obscene polluted joys:</a>
<a id='line_10559'>  The Trojan sword had curd his love of boys,</a>
<a id='line_10560'>  Had not his sev'n bold brethren stopp'd the course</a>
<a id='line_10561'>  Of the fierce champions, with united force.</a>
<a id='line_10562'>  Sev'n darts were thrown at once; and some rebound</a>
<a id='line_10563'>  From his bright shield, some on his helmet sound:</a>
<a id='line_10564'>  The rest had reach'd him; but his mother's care</a>
<a id='line_10565'>  Prevented those, and turn'd aside in air.</a>
<a id='line_10566'></a>
<a id='line_10567'>  The prince then call'd Achates, to supply</a>
<a id='line_10568'>  The spears that knew the way to victory-</a>
<a id='line_10569'>  "Those fatal weapons, which, inur'd to blood,</a>
<a id='line_10570'>  In Grecian bodies under Ilium stood:</a>
<a id='line_10571'>  Not one of those my hand shall toss in vain</a>
<a id='line_10572'>  Against our foes, on this contended plain."</a>
<a id='line_10573'>  He said; then seiz'd a mighty spear, and threw;</a>
<a id='line_10574'>  Which, wing'd with fate, thro' Maeon's buckler flew,</a>
<a id='line_10575'>  Pierc'd all the brazen plates, and reach'd his heart:</a>
<a id='line_10576'>  He stagger'd with intolerable smart.</a>
<a id='line_10577'>  Alcanor saw; and reach'd, but reach'd in vain,</a>
<a id='line_10578'>  His helping hand, his brother to sustain.</a>
<a id='line_10579'>  A second spear, which kept the former course,</a>
<a id='line_10580'>  From the same hand, and sent with equal force,</a>
<a id='line_10581'>  His right arm pierc'd, and holding on, bereft</a>
<a id='line_10582'>  His use of both, and pinion'd down his left.</a>
<a id='line_10583'>  Then Numitor from his dead brother drew</a>
<a id='line_10584'>  Th' ill-omen'd spear, and at the Trojan threw:</a>
<a id='line_10585'>  Preventing fate directs the lance awry,</a>
<a id='line_10586'>  Which, glancing, only mark'd Achates' thigh.</a>
<a id='line_10587'></a>
<a id='line_10588'>  In pride of youth the Sabine Clausus came,</a>
<a id='line_10589'>  And, from afar, at Dryops took his aim.</a>
<a id='line_10590'>  The spear flew hissing thro' the middle space,</a>
<a id='line_10591'>  And pierc'd his throat, directed at his face;</a>
<a id='line_10592'>  It stopp'd at once the passage of his wind,</a>
<a id='line_10593'>  And the free soul to flitting air resign'd:</a>
<a id='line_10594'>  His forehead was the first that struck the ground;</a>
<a id='line_10595'>  Lifeblood and life rush'd mingled thro' the wound.</a>
<a id='line_10596'>  He slew three brothers of the Borean race,</a>
<a id='line_10597'>  And three, whom Ismarus, their native place,</a>
<a id='line_10598'>  Had sent to war, but all the sons of Thrace.</a>
<a id='line_10599'>  Halesus, next, the bold Aurunci leads:</a>
<a id='line_10600'>  The son of Neptune to his aid succeeds,</a>
<a id='line_10601'>  Conspicuous on his horse. On either hand,</a>
<a id='line_10602'>  These fight to keep, and those to win, the land.</a>
<a id='line_10603'>  With mutual blood th' Ausonian soil is dyed,</a>
<a id='line_10604'>  While on its borders each their claim decide.</a>
<a id='line_10605'>  As wintry winds, contending in the sky,</a>
<a id='line_10606'>  With equal force of lungs their titles try:</a>
<a id='line_10607'>  They rage, they roar; the doubtful rack of heav'n</a>
<a id='line_10608'>  Stands without motion, and the tide undriv'n:</a>
<a id='line_10609'>  Each bent to conquer, neither side to yield,</a>
<a id='line_10610'>  They long suspend the fortune of the field.</a>
<a id='line_10611'>  Both armies thus perform what courage can;</a>
<a id='line_10612'>  Foot set to foot, and mingled man to man.</a>
<a id='line_10613'></a>
<a id='line_10614'>  But, in another part, th' Arcadian horse</a>
<a id='line_10615'>  With ill success ingage the Latin force:</a>
<a id='line_10616'>  For, where th' impetuous torrent, rushing down,</a>
<a id='line_10617'>  Huge craggy stones and rooted trees had thrown,</a>
<a id='line_10618'>  They left their coursers, and, unus'd to fight</a>
<a id='line_10619'>  On foot, were scatter'd in a shameful flight.</a>
<a id='line_10620'>  Pallas, who with disdain and grief had view'd</a>
<a id='line_10621'>  His foes pursuing, and his friends pursued,</a>
<a id='line_10622'>  Us'd threat'nings mix'd with pray'rs, his last resource,</a>
<a id='line_10623'>  With these to move their minds, with those to fire their force</a>
<a id='line_10624'>  "Which way, companions? whether would you run?</a>
<a id='line_10625'>  By you yourselves, and mighty battles won,</a>

<a id='line_10639'>  No passage left, unless we swim the main;</a>
<a id='line_10640'>  Or, forcing these, the Trojan trenches gain."</a>
<a id='line_10641'>  This said, he strode with eager haste along,</a>

<a id='line_10643'>  Lagus, the first he met, with fate to foe,</a>
<a id='line_10644'>  Had heav'd a stone of mighty weight, to throw:</a>

<a id='line_10646'>  Just where the bone distinguished either loin:</a>
<a id='line_10647'>  It stuck so fast, so deeply buried lay,</a>
<a id='line_10648'>  That scarce the victor forc'd the steel away.</a>
<a id='line_10649'>  Hisbon came on: but, while he mov'd too slow</a>
<a id='line_10650'>  To wish'd revenge, the prince prevents his blow;</a>
<a id='line_10651'>  For, warding his at once, at once he press'd,</a>
<a id='line_10652'>  And plung'd the fatal weapon in his breast.</a>
<a id='line_10653'>  Then lewd Anchemolus he laid in dust,</a>
<a id='line_10654'>  Who stain'd his stepdam's bed with impious lust.</a>
<a id='line_10655'>  And, after him, the Daucian twins were slain,</a>
<a id='line_10656'>  Laris and Thymbrus, on the Latian plain;</a>
<a id='line_10657'>  So wondrous like in feature, shape, and size,</a>
<a id='line_10658'>  As caus'd an error in their parents' eyes-</a>
<a id='line_10659'>  Grateful mistake! but soon the sword decides</a>
<a id='line_10660'>  The nice distinction, and their fate divides:</a>
<a id='line_10661'>  For Thymbrus' head was lopp'd; and Laris' hand,</a>
<a id='line_10662'>  Dismember'd, sought its owner on the strand:</a>
<a id='line_10663'>  The trembling fingers yet the fauchion strain,</a>
<a id='line_10664'>  And threaten still th' intended stroke in vain.</a>
<a id='line_10665'></a>
<a id='line_10666'>  Now, to renew the charge, th' Arcadians came:</a>
<a id='line_10667'>  Sight of such acts, and sense of honest shame,</a>
<a id='line_10668'>  And grief, with anger mix'd, their minds inflame.</a>
<a id='line_10669'>  Then, with a casual blow was Rhoeteus slain,</a>

<a id='line_10673'>  From Teuthras and from Tyres while he fled,</a>
<a id='line_10674'>  The lance, athwart his body, laid him dead:</a>
<a id='line_10675'>  Roll'd from his chariot with a mortal wound,</a>
<a id='line_10676'>  And intercepted fate, he spurn'd the ground.</a>
<a id='line_10677'>  As when, in summer, welcome winds arise,</a>
<a id='line_10678'>  The watchful shepherd to the forest flies,</a>

<a id='line_10681'>  Around the forest flies the furious blast,</a>
<a id='line_10682'>  And all the leafy nation sinks at last,</a>

<a id='line_10688'></a>
<a id='line_10689'>  Halesus came, fierce with desire of blood;</a>

<a id='line_10691'>  Advancing then, he plied the spear so well,</a>
<a id='line_10692'>  Ladon, Demodocus, and Pheres fell.</a>
<a id='line_10693'>  Around his head he toss'd his glitt'ring brand,</a>
<a id='line_10694'>  And from Strymonius hew'd his better hand,</a>
<a id='line_10695'>  Held up to guard his throat; then hurl'd a stone</a>
<a id='line_10696'>  At Thoas' ample front, and pierc'd the bone:</a>
<a id='line_10697'>  It struck beneath the space of either eye;</a>
<a id='line_10698'>  And blood, and mingled brains, together fly.</a>
<a id='line_10699'>  Deep skill'd in future fates, Halesus' sire</a>
<a id='line_10700'>  Did with the youth to lonely groves retire:</a>
<a id='line_10701'>  But, when the father's mortal race was run,</a>

<a id='line_10705'>  Pallas th' encounter seeks, but, ere he throws,</a>

<a id='line_10726'>  Here Pallas urges on, and Lausus there:</a>
<a id='line_10727'>  Of equal youth and beauty both appear,</a>

<a id='line_10729'>  Their congress in the field great Jove withstands:</a>
<a id='line_10730'>  Both doom'd to fall, but fall by greater hands.</a>
<a id='line_10731'></a>
<a id='line_10732'>  Meantime Juturna warns the Daunian chief</a>

<a id='line_10734'>  With his driv'n chariot he divides the crowd,</a>
<a id='line_10735'>  And, making to his friends, thus calls aloud:</a>
<a id='line_10736'>  "Let none presume his needless aid to join;</a>
<a id='line_10737'>  Retire, and clear the field; the fight is mine:</a>
<a id='line_10738'>  To this right hand is Pallas only due;</a>
<a id='line_10739'>  O were his father here, my just revenge to view!"</a>
<a id='line_10740'>  From the forbidden space his men retir'd.</a>
<a id='line_10741'>  Pallas their awe, and his stern words, admir'd;</a>
<a id='line_10742'>  Survey'd him o'er and o'er with wond'ring sight,</a>
<a id='line_10743'>  Struck with his haughty mien, and tow'ring height.</a>
<a id='line_10744'>  Then to the king: "Your empty vaunts forbear;</a>
<a id='line_10745'>  Success I hope, and fate I cannot fear;</a>
<a id='line_10746'>  Alive or dead, I shall deserve a name;</a>
<a id='line_10747'>  Jove is impartial, and to both the same."</a>
<a id='line_10748'>  He said, and to the void advanc'd his pace:</a>
<a id='line_10749'>  Pale horror sate on each Arcadian face.</a>
<a id='line_10750'>  Then Turnus, from his chariot leaping light,</a>
<a id='line_10751'>  Address'd himself on foot to single fight.</a>
<a id='line_10752'>  And, as a lion- when he spies from far</a>
<a id='line_10753'>  A bull that seems to meditate the war,</a>
<a id='line_10754'>  Bending his neck, and spurning back the sand-</a>
<a id='line_10755'>  Runs roaring downward from his hilly stand:</a>
<a id='line_10756'>  Imagine eager Turnus not more slow,</a>
<a id='line_10757'>  To rush from high on his unequal foe.</a>
<a id='line_10758'></a>
<a id='line_10759'>  Young Pallas, when he saw the chief advance</a>
<a id='line_10760'>  Within due distance of his flying lance,</a>
<a id='line_10761'>  Prepares to charge him first, resolv'd to try</a>
<a id='line_10762'>  If fortune would his want of force supply;</a>
<a id='line_10763'>  And thus to Heav'n and Hercules address'd:</a>
<a id='line_10764'>  "Alcides, once on earth Evander's guest,</a>
<a id='line_10765'>  His son adjures you by those holy rites,</a>
<a id='line_10766'>  That hospitable board, those genial nights;</a>
<a id='line_10767'>  Assist my great attempt to gain this prize,</a>
<a id='line_10768'>  And let proud Turnus view, with dying eyes,</a>
<a id='line_10769'>  His ravish'd spoils." 'T was heard, the vain request;</a>
<a id='line_10770'>  Alcides mourn'd, and stifled sighs within his breast.</a>
<a id='line_10771'>  Then Jove, to soothe his sorrow, thus began:</a>
<a id='line_10772'>  "Short bounds of life are set to mortal man.</a>
<a id='line_10773'>  'T is virtue's work alone to stretch the narrow span.</a>
<a id='line_10774'>  So many sons of gods, in bloody fight,</a>
<a id='line_10775'>  Around the walls of Troy, have lost the light:</a>
<a id='line_10776'>  My own Sarpedon fell beneath his foe;</a>
<a id='line_10777'>  Nor I, his mighty sire, could ward the blow.</a>
<a id='line_10778'>  Ev'n Turnus shortly shall resign his breath,</a>
<a id='line_10779'>  And stands already on the verge of death."</a>
<a id='line_10780'>  This said, the god permits the fatal fight,</a>
<a id='line_10781'>  But from the Latian fields averts his sight.</a>
<a id='line_10782'></a>
<a id='line_10783'>  Now with full force his spear young Pallas threw,</a>
<a id='line_10784'>  And, having thrown, his shining fauchion drew</a>
<a id='line_10785'>  The steel just graz'd along the shoulder joint,</a>
<a id='line_10786'>  And mark'd it slightly with the glancing point,</a>
<a id='line_10787'>  Fierce Turnus first to nearer distance drew,</a>
<a id='line_10788'>  And pois'd his pointed spear, before he threw:</a>
<a id='line_10789'>  Then, as the winged weapon whizz'd along,</a>
<a id='line_10790'>  "See now," said he, "whose arm is better strung."</a>
<a id='line_10791'>  The spear kept on the fatal course, unstay'd</a>
<a id='line_10792'>  By plates of ir'n, which o'er the shield were laid:</a>
<a id='line_10793'>  Thro' folded brass and tough bull hides it pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_10794'>  His corslet pierc'd, and reach'd his heart at last.</a>
<a id='line_10795'>  In vain the youth tugs at the broken wood;</a>
<a id='line_10796'>  The soul comes issuing with the vital blood:</a>
<a id='line_10797'>  He falls; his arms upon his body sound;</a>
<a id='line_10798'>  And with his bloody teeth he bites the ground.</a>
<a id='line_10799'></a>
<a id='line_10800'>  Turnus bestrode the corpse: "Arcadians, hear,"</a>
<a id='line_10801'>  Said he; "my message to your master bear:</a>
<a id='line_10802'>  Such as the sire deserv'd, the son I send;</a>
<a id='line_10803'>  It costs him dear to be the Phrygians' friend.</a>
<a id='line_10804'>  The lifeless body, tell him, I bestow,</a>
<a id='line_10805'>  Unask'd, to rest his wand'ring ghost below."</a>
<a id='line_10806'>  He said, and trampled down with all the force</a>
<a id='line_10807'>  Of his left foot, and spurn'd the wretched corse;</a>
<a id='line_10808'>  Then snatch'd the shining belt, with gold inlaid;</a>
<a id='line_10809'>  The belt Eurytion's artful hands had made,</a>
<a id='line_10810'>  Where fifty fatal brides, express'd to sight,</a>
<a id='line_10811'>  All in the compass of one mournful night,</a>
<a id='line_10812'>  Depriv'd their bridegrooms of returning light.</a>
<a id='line_10813'></a>
<a id='line_10814'>  In an ill hour insulting Turnus tore</a>
<a id='line_10815'>  Those golden spoils, and in a worse he wore.</a>
<a id='line_10816'>  O mortals, blind in fate, who never know</a>
<a id='line_10817'>  To bear high fortune, or endure the low!</a>
<a id='line_10818'>  The time shall come, when Turnus, but in vain,</a>
<a id='line_10819'>  Shall wish untouch'd the trophies of the slain;</a>
<a id='line_10820'>  Shall wish the fatal belt were far away,</a>
<a id='line_10821'>  And curse the dire remembrance of the day.</a>
<a id='line_10822'></a>
<a id='line_10823'>  The sad Arcadians, from th' unhappy field,</a>
<a id='line_10824'>  Bear back the breathless body on a shield.</a>
<a id='line_10825'>  O grace and grief of war! at once restor'd,</a>
<a id='line_10826'>  With praises, to thy sire, at once deplor'd!</a>
<a id='line_10827'>  One day first sent thee to the fighting field,</a>
<a id='line_10828'>  Beheld whole heaps of foes in battle kill'd;</a>
<a id='line_10829'>  One day beheld thee dead, and borne upon thy shield.</a>
<a id='line_10830'>  This dismal news, not from uncertain fame,</a>
<a id='line_10831'>  But sad spectators, to the hero came:</a>
<a id='line_10832'>  His friends upon the brink of ruin stand,</a>
<a id='line_10833'>  Unless reliev'd by his victorious hand.</a>
<a id='line_10834'>  He whirls his sword around, without delay,</a>
<a id='line_10835'>  And hews thro' adverse foes an ample way,</a>
<a id='line_10836'>  To find fierce Turnus, of his conquest proud:</a>
<a id='line_10837'>  Evander, Pallas, all that friendship ow'd</a>
<a id='line_10838'>  To large deserts, are present to his eyes;</a>
<a id='line_10839'>  His plighted hand, and hospitable ties.</a>
<a id='line_10840'></a>
<a id='line_10841'>  Four sons of Sulmo, four whom Ufens bred,</a>
<a id='line_10842'>  He took in fight, and living victims led,</a>
<a id='line_10843'>  To please the ghost of Pallas, and expire,</a>
<a id='line_10844'>  In sacrifice, before his fun'ral fire.</a>
<a id='line_10845'>  At Magus next he threw: he stoop'd below</a>
<a id='line_10846'>  The flying spear, and shunn'd the promis'd blow;</a>
<a id='line_10847'>  Then, creeping, clasp'd the hero's knees, and pray'd:</a>
<a id='line_10848'>  "By young Iulus, by thy father's shade,</a>
<a id='line_10849'>  O spare my life, and send me back to see</a>
<a id='line_10850'>  My longing sire, and tender progeny!</a>
<a id='line_10851'>  A lofty house I have, and wealth untold,</a>
<a id='line_10852'>  In silver ingots, and in bars of gold:</a>
<a id='line_10853'>  All these, and sums besides, which see no day,</a>
<a id='line_10854'>  The ransom of this one poor life shall pay.</a>
<a id='line_10855'>  If I survive, will Troy the less prevail?</a>
<a id='line_10856'>  A single soul's too light to turn the scale."</a>
<a id='line_10857'>  He said. The hero sternly thus replied:</a>
<a id='line_10858'>  "Thy bars and ingots, and the sums beside,</a>
<a id='line_10859'>  Leave for thy children's lot. Thy Turnus broke</a>
<a id='line_10860'>  All rules of war by one relentless stroke,</a>
<a id='line_10861'>  When Pallas fell: so deems, nor deems alone</a>
<a id='line_10862'>  My father's shadow, but my living son."</a>
<a id='line_10863'>  Thus having said, of kind remorse bereft,</a>
<a id='line_10864'>  He seiz'd his helm, and dragg'd him with his left;</a>
<a id='line_10865'>  Then with his right hand, while his neck he wreath'd,</a>
<a id='line_10866'>  Up to the hilts his shining fauchion sheath'd.</a>
<a id='line_10867'></a>
<a id='line_10868'>  Apollo's priest, Emonides, was near;</a>
<a id='line_10869'>  His holy fillets on his front appear;</a>
<a id='line_10870'>  Glitt'ring in arms, he shone amidst the crowd;</a>
<a id='line_10871'>  Much of his god, more of his purple, proud.</a>
<a id='line_10872'>  Him the fierce Trojan follow'd thro' the field:</a>
<a id='line_10873'>  The holy coward fell; and, forc'd to yield,</a>
<a id='line_10874'>  The prince stood o'er the priest, and, at one blow,</a>
<a id='line_10875'>  Sent him an off'ring to the shades below.</a>
<a id='line_10876'>  His arms Seresthus on his shoulders bears,</a>
<a id='line_10877'>  Design'd a trophy to the God of Wars.</a>
<a id='line_10878'></a>
<a id='line_10879'>  Vulcanian Caeculus renews the fight,</a>
<a id='line_10880'>  And Umbro, born upon the mountains' height.</a>
<a id='line_10881'>  The champion cheers his troops t' encounter those,</a>
<a id='line_10882'>  And seeks revenge himself on other foes.</a>
<a id='line_10883'>  At Anxur's shield he drove; and, at the blow,</a>
<a id='line_10884'>  Both shield and arm to ground together go.</a>
<a id='line_10885'>  Anxur had boasted much of magic charms,</a>
<a id='line_10886'>  And thought he wore impenetrable arms,</a>
<a id='line_10887'>  So made by mutter'd spells; and, from the spheres,</a>
<a id='line_10888'>  Had life secur'd, in vain, for length of years.</a>
<a id='line_10889'>  Then Tarquitus the field in triumph trod;</a>
<a id='line_10890'>  A nymph his mother, his sire a god.</a>
<a id='line_10891'>  Exulting in bright arms, he braves the prince:</a>
<a id='line_10892'>  With his protended lance he makes defense;</a>
<a id='line_10893'>  Bears back his feeble foe; then, pressing on,</a>
<a id='line_10894'>  Arrests his better hand, and drags him down;</a>
<a id='line_10895'>  Stands o'er the prostrate wretch, and, as he lay,</a>
<a id='line_10896'>  Vain tales inventing, and prepar'd to pray,</a>
<a id='line_10897'>  Mows off his head: the trunk a moment stood,</a>
<a id='line_10898'>  Then sunk, and roll'd along the sand in blood.</a>
<a id='line_10899'>  The vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain:</a>
<a id='line_10900'>  "Lie there, proud man, unpitied, on the plain;</a>
<a id='line_10901'>  Lie there, inglorious, and without a tomb,</a>
<a id='line_10902'>  Far from thy mother and thy native home,</a>
<a id='line_10903'>  Exposed to savage beasts, and birds of prey,</a>
<a id='line_10904'>  Or thrown for food to monsters of the sea."</a>
<a id='line_10905'></a>
<a id='line_10906'>  On Lycas and Antaeus next he ran,</a>
<a id='line_10907'>  Two chiefs of Turnus, and who led his van.</a>
<a id='line_10908'>  They fled for fear; with these, he chas'd along</a>
<a id='line_10909'>  Camers the yellow-lock'd, and Numa strong;</a>
<a id='line_10910'>  Both great in arms, and both were fair and young.</a>
<a id='line_10911'>  Camers was son to Volscens lately slain,</a>
<a id='line_10912'>  In wealth surpassing all the Latian train,</a>
<a id='line_10913'>  And in Amycla fix'd his silent easy reign.</a>
<a id='line_10914'>  And, as Aegaeon, when with heav'n he strove,</a>
<a id='line_10915'>  Stood opposite in arms to mighty Jove;</a>
<a id='line_10916'>  Mov'd all his hundred hands, provok'd the war,</a>
<a id='line_10917'>  Defied the forky lightning from afar;</a>
<a id='line_10918'>  At fifty mouths his flaming breath expires,</a>
<a id='line_10919'>  And flash for flash returns, and fires for fires;</a>
<a id='line_10920'>  In his right hand as many swords he wields,</a>
<a id='line_10921'>  And takes the thunder on as many shields:</a>
<a id='line_10922'>  With strength like his, the Trojan hero stood;</a>
<a id='line_10923'>  And soon the fields with falling corps were strow'd,</a>
<a id='line_10924'>  When once his fauchion found the taste of blood.</a>
<a id='line_10925'>  With fury scarce to be conceiv'd, he flew</a>
<a id='line_10926'>  Against Niphaeus, whom four coursers drew.</a>
<a id='line_10927'>  They, when they see the fiery chief advance,</a>
<a id='line_10928'>  And pushing at their chests his pointed lance,</a>
<a id='line_10929'>  Wheel'd with so swift a motion, mad with fear,</a>
<a id='line_10930'>  They threw their master headlong from the chair.</a>
<a id='line_10931'>  They stare, they start, nor stop their course, before</a>
<a id='line_10932'>  They bear the bounding chariot to the shore.</a>
<a id='line_10933'></a>
<a id='line_10934'>  Now Lucagus and Liger scour the plains,</a>
<a id='line_10935'>  With two white steeds; but Liger holds the reins,</a>
<a id='line_10936'>  And Lucagus the lofty seat maintains:</a>
<a id='line_10937'>  Bold brethren both. The former wav'd in air</a>
<a id='line_10938'>  His flaming sword: Aeneas couch'd his spear,</a>
<a id='line_10939'>  Unus'd to threats, and more unus'd to fear.</a>
<a id='line_10940'>  Then Liger thus: "Thy confidence is vain</a>
<a id='line_10941'>  To scape from hence, as from the Trojan plain:</a>
<a id='line_10942'>  Nor these the steeds which Diomede bestrode,</a>
<a id='line_10943'>  Nor this the chariot where Achilles rode;</a>
<a id='line_10944'>  Nor Venus' veil is here, near Neptune's shield;</a>
<a id='line_10945'>  Thy fatal hour is come, and this the field."</a>
<a id='line_10946'>  Thus Liger vainly vaunts: the Trojan peer</a>
<a id='line_10947'>  Return'd his answer with his flying spear.</a>
<a id='line_10948'>  As Lucagus, to lash his horses, bends,</a>
<a id='line_10949'>  Prone to the wheels, and his left foot protends,</a>
<a id='line_10950'>  Prepar'd for fight; the fatal dart arrives,</a>
<a id='line_10951'>  And thro' the borders of his buckler drives;</a>
<a id='line_10952'>  Pass'd thro' and pierc'd his groin: the deadly wound,</a>
<a id='line_10953'>  Cast from his chariot, roll'd him on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_10954'>  Whom thus the chief upbraids with scornful spite:</a>
<a id='line_10955'>  "Blame not the slowness of your steeds in flight;</a>
<a id='line_10956'>  Vain shadows did not force their swift retreat;</a>
<a id='line_10957'>  But you yourself forsake your empty seat."</a>
<a id='line_10958'>  He said, and seiz'd at once the loosen'd rein;</a>
<a id='line_10959'>  For Liger lay already on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_10960'>  By the same shock: then, stretching out his hands,</a>
<a id='line_10961'>  The recreant thus his wretched life demands:</a>
<a id='line_10962'>  "Now, by thyself, O more than mortal man!</a>
<a id='line_10963'>  By her and him from whom thy breath began,</a>
<a id='line_10964'>  Who form'd thee thus divine, I beg thee, spare</a>
<a id='line_10965'>  This forfeit life, and hear thy suppliant's pray'r."</a>
<a id='line_10966'>  Thus much he spoke, and more he would have said;</a>
<a id='line_10967'>  But the stern hero turn'd aside his head,</a>
<a id='line_10968'>  And cut him short: "I hear another man;</a>
<a id='line_10969'>  You talk'd not thus before the fight began.</a>
<a id='line_10970'>  Now take your turn; and, as a brother should,</a>
<a id='line_10971'>  Attend your brother to the Stygian flood."</a>
<a id='line_10972'>  Then thro' his breast his fatal sword he sent,</a>
<a id='line_10973'>  And the soul issued at the gaping vent.</a>
<a id='line_10974'></a>
<a id='line_10975'>  As storms the skies, and torrents tear the ground,</a>
<a id='line_10976'>  Thus rag'd the prince, and scatter'd deaths around.</a>
<a id='line_10977'>  At length Ascanius and the Trojan train</a>
<a id='line_10978'>  Broke from the camp, so long besieg'd in vain.</a>
<a id='line_10979'></a>
<a id='line_10980'>  Meantime the King of Gods and Mortal Man</a>
<a id='line_10981'>  Held conference with his queen, and thus began:</a>
<a id='line_10982'>  "My sister goddess, and well-pleasing wife,</a>
<a id='line_10983'>  Still think you Venus' aid supports the strife-</a>
<a id='line_10984'>  Sustains her Trojans- or themselves, alone,</a>
<a id='line_10985'>  With inborn valor force their fortune on?</a>
<a id='line_10986'>  How fierce in fight, with courage undecay'd!</a>
<a id='line_10987'>  Judge if such warriors want immortal aid."</a>
<a id='line_10988'>  To whom the goddess with the charming eyes,</a>
<a id='line_10989'>  Soft in her tone, submissively replies:</a>
<a id='line_10990'>  "Why, O my sov'reign lord, whose frown I fear,</a>
<a id='line_10991'>  And cannot, unconcern'd, your anger bear;</a>
<a id='line_10992'>  Why urge you thus my grief? when, if I still</a>
<a id='line_10993'>  (As once I was) were mistress of your will,</a>
<a id='line_10994'>  From your almighty pow'r your pleasing wife</a>
<a id='line_10995'>  Might gain the grace of length'ning Turnus' life,</a>
<a id='line_10996'>  Securely snatch him from the fatal fight,</a>
<a id='line_10997'>  And give him to his aged father's sight.</a>
<a id='line_10998'>  Now let him perish, since you hold it good,</a>
<a id='line_10999'>  And glut the Trojans with his pious blood.</a>
<a id='line_11000'>  Yet from our lineage he derives his name,</a>
<a id='line_11001'>  And, in the fourth degree, from god Pilumnus came;</a>
<a id='line_11002'>  Yet he devoutly pays you rites divine,</a>
<a id='line_11003'>  And offers daily incense at your shrine."</a>
<a id='line_11004'></a>
<a id='line_11005'>  Then shortly thus the sov'reign god replied:</a>
<a id='line_11006'>  "Since in my pow'r and goodness you confide,</a>
<a id='line_11007'>  If for a little space, a lengthen'd span,</a>
<a id='line_11008'>  You beg reprieve for this expiring man,</a>
<a id='line_11009'>  I grant you leave to take your Turnus hence</a>
<a id='line_11010'>  From instant fate, and can so far dispense.</a>
<a id='line_11011'>  But, if some secret meaning lies beneath,</a>
<a id='line_11012'>  To save the short-liv'd youth from destin'd death,</a>
<a id='line_11013'>  Or if a farther thought you entertain,</a>
<a id='line_11014'>  To change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain."</a>
<a id='line_11015'>  To whom the goddess thus, with weeping eyes:</a>
<a id='line_11016'>  "And what if that request, your tongue denies,</a>
<a id='line_11017'>  Your heart should grant; and not a short reprieve,</a>
<a id='line_11018'>  But length of certain life, to Turnus give?</a>
<a id='line_11019'>  Now speedy death attends the guiltless youth,</a>
<a id='line_11020'>  If my presaging soul divines with truth;</a>
<a id='line_11021'>  Which, O! I wish, might err thro' causeless fears,</a>
<a id='line_11022'>  And you (for you have pow'r) prolong his years!"</a>
<a id='line_11023'></a>
<a id='line_11024'>  Thus having said, involv'd in clouds, she flies,</a>
<a id='line_11025'>  And drives a storm before her thro' the skies.</a>
<a id='line_11026'>  Swift she descends, alighting on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_11027'>  Where the fierce foes a dubious fight maintain.</a>
<a id='line_11028'>  Of air condens'd a specter soon she made;</a>
<a id='line_11029'>  And, what Aeneas was, such seem'd the shade.</a>
<a id='line_11030'>  Adorn'd with Dardan arms, the phantom bore</a>
<a id='line_11031'>  His head aloft; a plumy crest he wore;</a>
<a id='line_11032'>  This hand appear'd a shining sword to wield,</a>
<a id='line_11033'>  And that sustain'd an imitated shield.</a>
<a id='line_11034'>  With manly mien he stalk'd along the ground,</a>
<a id='line_11035'>  Nor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting sound.</a>
<a id='line_11036'>  (Thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight,</a>
<a id='line_11037'>  Or dreadful visions in our dreams by night.)</a>
<a id='line_11038'>  The specter seems the Daunian chief to dare,</a>
<a id='line_11039'>  And flourishes his empty sword in air.</a>
<a id='line_11040'>  At this, advancing, Turnus hurl'd his spear:</a>
<a id='line_11041'>  The phantom wheel'd, and seem'd to fly for fear.</a>
<a id='line_11042'>  Deluded Turnus thought the Trojan fled,</a>
<a id='line_11043'>  And with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed.</a>
<a id='line_11044'>  "Whether, O coward?" (thus he calls aloud,</a>
<a id='line_11045'>  Nor found he spoke to wind, and chas'd a cloud,)</a>
<a id='line_11046'>  "Why thus forsake your bride! Receive from me</a>
<a id='line_11047'>  The fated land you sought so long by sea."</a>
<a id='line_11048'>  He said, and, brandishing at once his blade,</a>
<a id='line_11049'>  With eager pace pursued the flying shade.</a>
<a id='line_11050'>  By chance a ship was fasten'd to the shore,</a>
<a id='line_11051'>  Which from old Clusium King Osinius bore:</a>
<a id='line_11052'>  The plank was ready laid for safe ascent;</a>
<a id='line_11053'>  For shelter there the trembling shadow bent,</a>
<a id='line_11054'>  And skipp't and skulk'd, and under hatches went.</a>
<a id='line_11055'>  Exulting Turnus, with regardless haste,</a>
<a id='line_11056'>  Ascends the plank, and to the galley pass'd.</a>
<a id='line_11057'>  Scarce had he reach'd the prow: Saturnia's hand</a>
<a id='line_11058'>  The haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land.</a>
<a id='line_11059'>  With wind in poop, the vessel plows the sea,</a>
<a id='line_11060'>  And measures back with speed her former way.</a>
<a id='line_11061'>  Meantime Aeneas seeks his absent foe,</a>
<a id='line_11062'>  And sends his slaughter'd troops to shades below.</a>
<a id='line_11063'></a>
<a id='line_11064'>  The guileful phantom now forsook the shroud,</a>
<a id='line_11065'>  And flew sublime, and vanish'd in a cloud.</a>
<a id='line_11066'>  Too late young Turnus the delusion found,</a>
<a id='line_11067'>  Far on the sea, still making from the ground.</a>
<a id='line_11068'>  Then, thankless for a life redeem'd by shame,</a>
<a id='line_11069'>  With sense of honor stung, and forfeit fame,</a>
<a id='line_11070'>  Fearful besides of what in fight had pass'd,</a>
<a id='line_11071'>  His hands and haggard eyes to heav'n he cast;</a>
<a id='line_11072'>  "O Jove!" he cried, "for what offense have</a>
<a id='line_11073'>  Deserv'd to bear this endless infamy?</a>
<a id='line_11074'>  Whence am I forc'd, and whether am I borne?</a>
<a id='line_11075'>  How, and with what reproach, shall I return?</a>
<a id='line_11076'>  Shall ever I behold the Latian plain,</a>
<a id='line_11077'>  Or see Laurentum's lofty tow'rs again?</a>
<a id='line_11078'>  What will they say of their deserting chief</a>
<a id='line_11079'>  The war was mine: I fly from their relief;</a>
<a id='line_11080'>  I led to slaughter, and in slaughter leave;</a>
<a id='line_11081'>  And ev'n from hence their dying groans receive.</a>
<a id='line_11082'>  Here, overmatch'd in fight, in heaps they lie;</a>
<a id='line_11083'>  There, scatter'd o'er the fields, ignobly fly.</a>
<a id='line_11084'>  Gape wide, O earth, and draw me down alive!</a>
<a id='line_11085'>  Or, O ye pitying winds, a wretch relieve!</a>
<a id='line_11086'>  On sands or shelves the splitting vessel drive;</a>
<a id='line_11087'>  Or set me shipwrack'd on some desart shore,</a>
<a id='line_11088'>  Where no Rutulian eyes may see me more,</a>
<a id='line_11089'>  Unknown to friends, or foes, or conscious Fame,</a>
<a id='line_11090'>  Lest she should follow, and my flight proclaim."</a>
<a id='line_11091'></a>
<a id='line_11092'>  Thus Turnus rav'd, and various fates revolv'd:</a>
<a id='line_11093'>  The choice was doubtful, but the death resolv'd.</a>
<a id='line_11094'>  And now the sword, and now the sea took place,</a>
<a id='line_11095'>  That to revenge, and this to purge disgrace.</a>
<a id='line_11096'>  Sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main,</a>
<a id='line_11097'>  By stretch of arms the distant shore to gain.</a>
<a id='line_11098'>  Thrice he the sword assay'd, and thrice the flood;</a>
<a id='line_11099'>  But Juno, mov'd with pity, both withstood.</a>
<a id='line_11100'>  And thrice repress'd his rage; strong gales supplied,</a>
<a id='line_11101'>  And push'd the vessel o'er the swelling tide.</a>
<a id='line_11102'>  At length she lands him on his native shores,</a>
<a id='line_11103'>  And to his father's longing arms restores.</a>
<a id='line_11104'></a>
<a id='line_11105'>  Meantime, by Jove's impulse, Mezentius arm'd,</a>
<a id='line_11106'>  Succeeding Turnus, with his ardor warm'd</a>
<a id='line_11107'>  His fainting friends, reproach'd their shameful flight,</a>
<a id='line_11108'>  Repell'd the victors, and renew'd the fight.</a>
<a id='line_11109'>  Against their king the Tuscan troops conspire;</a>
<a id='line_11110'>  Such is their hate, and such their fierce desire</a>
<a id='line_11111'>  Of wish'd revenge: on him, and him alone,</a>
<a id='line_11112'>  All hands employ'd, and all their darts are thrown.</a>
<a id='line_11113'>  He, like a solid rock by seas inclos'd,</a>
<a id='line_11114'>  To raging winds and roaring waves oppos'd,</a>
<a id='line_11115'>  From his proud summit looking down, disdains</a>
<a id='line_11116'>  Their empty menace, and unmov'd remains.</a>
<a id='line_11117'></a>
<a id='line_11118'>  Beneath his feet fell haughty Hebrus dead,</a>
<a id='line_11119'>  Then Latagus, and Palmus as he fled.</a>
<a id='line_11120'>  At Latagus a weighty stone he flung:</a>
<a id='line_11121'>  His face was flatted, and his helmet rung.</a>
<a id='line_11122'>  But Palmus from behind receives his wound;</a>
<a id='line_11123'>  Hamstring'd he falls, and grovels on the ground:</a>
<a id='line_11124'>  His crest and armor, from his body torn,</a>
<a id='line_11125'>  Thy shoulders, Lausus, and thy head adorn.</a>
<a id='line_11126'>  Evas and Mimas, both of Troy, he slew.</a>
<a id='line_11127'>  Mimas his birth from fair Theano drew,</a>
<a id='line_11128'>  Born on that fatal night, when, big with fire,</a>
<a id='line_11129'>  The queen produc'd young Paris to his sire:</a>
<a id='line_11130'>  But Paris in the Phrygian fields was slain,</a>
<a id='line_11131'>  Unthinking Mimas on the Latian plain.</a>
<a id='line_11132'></a>
<a id='line_11133'>  And, as a savage boar, on mountains bred,</a>
<a id='line_11134'>  With forest mast and fatt'ning marshes fed,</a>
<a id='line_11135'>  When once he sees himself in toils inclos'd,</a>
<a id='line_11136'>  By huntsmen and their eager hounds oppos'd-</a>
<a id='line_11137'>  He whets his tusks, and turns, and dares the war;</a>
<a id='line_11138'>  Th' invaders dart their jav'lins from afar:</a>
<a id='line_11139'>  All keep aloof, and safely shout around;</a>
<a id='line_11140'>  But none presumes to give a nearer wound:</a>
<a id='line_11141'>  He frets and froths, erects his bristled hide,</a>
<a id='line_11142'>  And shakes a grove of lances from his side:</a>
<a id='line_11143'>  Not otherwise the troops, with hate inspir'd,</a>
<a id='line_11144'>  And just revenge against the tyrant fir'd,</a>
<a id='line_11145'>  Their darts with clamor at a distance drive,</a>
<a id='line_11146'>  And only keep the languish'd war alive.</a>
<a id='line_11147'></a>
<a id='line_11148'>  From Coritus came Acron to the fight,</a>
<a id='line_11149'>  Who left his spouse betroth'd, and unconsummate night.</a>
<a id='line_11150'>  Mezentius sees him thro' the squadrons ride,</a>
<a id='line_11151'>  Proud of the purple favors of his bride.</a>
<a id='line_11152'>  Then, as a hungry lion, who beholds</a>
<a id='line_11153'>  A gamesome goat, who frisks about the folds,</a>
<a id='line_11154'>  Or beamy stag, that grazes on the plain-</a>
<a id='line_11155'>  He runs, he roars, he shakes his rising mane,</a>
<a id='line_11156'>  He grins, and opens wide his greedy jaws;</a>
<a id='line_11157'>  The prey lies panting underneath his paws:</a>
<a id='line_11158'>  He fills his famish'd maw; his mouth runs o'er</a>
<a id='line_11159'>  With unchew'd morsels, while he churns the gore:</a>
<a id='line_11160'>  So proud Mezentius rushes on his foes,</a>
<a id='line_11161'>  And first unhappy Acron overthrows:</a>
<a id='line_11162'>  Stretch'd at his length, he spurns the swarthy ground;</a>
<a id='line_11163'>  The lance, besmear'd with blood, lies broken in the wound.</a>
<a id='line_11164'>  Then with disdain the haughty victor view'd</a>
<a id='line_11165'>  Orodes flying, nor the wretch pursued,</a>
<a id='line_11166'>  Nor thought the dastard's back deserv'd a wound,</a>
<a id='line_11167'>  But, running, gain'd th' advantage of the ground:</a>
<a id='line_11168'>  Then turning short, he met him face to face,</a>
<a id='line_11169'>  To give his victor the better grace.</a>
<a id='line_11170'>  Orodes falls, in equal fight oppress'd:</a>
<a id='line_11171'>  Mezentius fix'd his foot upon his breast,</a>
<a id='line_11172'>  And rested lance; and thus aloud he cries:</a>
<a id='line_11173'>  "Lo! here the champion of my rebels lies!"</a>
<a id='line_11174'>  The fields around with Io Paean! ring;</a>
<a id='line_11175'>  And peals of shouts applaud the conqu'ring king.</a>
<a id='line_11176'>  At this the vanquish'd, with his dying breath,</a>
<a id='line_11177'>  Thus faintly spoke, and prophesied in death:</a>
<a id='line_11178'>  "Nor thou, proud man, unpunish'd shalt remain:</a>
<a id='line_11179'>  Like death attends thee on this fatal plain."</a>
<a id='line_11180'>  Then, sourly smiling, thus the king replied:</a>
<a id='line_11181'>  "For what belongs to me, let Jove provide;</a>
<a id='line_11182'>  But die thou first, whatever chance ensue."</a>
<a id='line_11183'>  He said, and from the wound the weapon drew.</a>
<a id='line_11184'>  A hov'ring mist came swimming o'er his sight,</a>
<a id='line_11185'>  And seal'd his eyes in everlasting night.</a>
<a id='line_11186'></a>
<a id='line_11187'>  By Caedicus, Alcathous was slain;</a>
<a id='line_11188'>  Sacrator laid Hydaspes on the plain;</a>
<a id='line_11189'>  Orses the strong to greater strength must yield;</a>
<a id='line_11190'>  He, with Parthenius, were by Rapo kill'd.</a>
<a id='line_11191'>  Then brave Messapus Ericetes slew,</a>
<a id='line_11192'>  Who from Lycaon's blood his lineage drew.</a>
<a id='line_11193'>  But from his headstrong horse his fate he found,</a>
<a id='line_11194'>  Who threw his master, as he made a bound:</a>
<a id='line_11195'>  The chief, alighting, stuck him to the ground;</a>
<a id='line_11196'>  Then Clonius, hand to hand, on foot assails:</a>
<a id='line_11197'>  The Trojan sinks, and Neptune's son prevails.</a>
<a id='line_11198'>  Agis the Lycian, stepping forth with pride,</a>
<a id='line_11199'>  To single fight the boldest foe defied;</a>
<a id='line_11200'>  Whom Tuscan Valerus by force o'ercame,</a>
<a id='line_11201'>  And not belied his mighty father's fame.</a>
<a id='line_11202'>  Salius to death the great Antronius sent:</a>
<a id='line_11203'>  But the same fate the victor underwent,</a>
<a id='line_11204'>  Slain by Nealces' hand, well-skill'd to throw</a>
<a id='line_11205'>  The flying dart, and draw the far-deceiving bow.</a>
<a id='line_11206'></a>
<a id='line_11207'>  Thus equal deaths are dealt with equal chance;</a>
<a id='line_11208'>  By turns they quit their ground, by turns advance:</a>
<a id='line_11209'>  Victors and vanquish'd, in the various field,</a>
<a id='line_11210'>  Nor wholly overcome, nor wholly yield.</a>
<a id='line_11211'>  The gods from heav'n survey the fatal strife,</a>
<a id='line_11212'>  And mourn the miseries of human life.</a>
<a id='line_11213'>  Above the rest, two goddesses appear</a>
<a id='line_11214'>  Concern'd for each: here Venus, Juno there.</a>
<a id='line_11215'>  Amidst the crowd, infernal Ate shakes</a>
<a id='line_11216'>  Her scourge aloft, and crest of hissing snakes.</a>
<a id='line_11217'></a>
<a id='line_11218'>  Once more the proud Mezentius, with disdain,</a>
<a id='line_11219'>  Brandish'd his spear, and rush'd into the plain,</a>
<a id='line_11220'>  Where tow'ring in the midmost rank she stood,</a>
<a id='line_11221'>  Like tall Orion stalking o'er the flood.</a>
<a id='line_11222'>  (When with his brawny breast he cuts the waves,</a>
<a id='line_11223'>  His shoulders scarce the topmost billow laves),</a>
<a id='line_11224'>  Or like a mountain ash, whose roots are spread,</a>
<a id='line_11225'>  Deep fix'd in earth; in clouds he hides his head.</a>
<a id='line_11226'></a>
<a id='line_11227'>  The Trojan prince beheld him from afar,</a>
<a id='line_11228'>  And dauntless undertook the doubtful war.</a>
<a id='line_11229'>  Collected in his strength, and like a rock,</a>
<a id='line_11230'>  Pois'd on his base, Mezentius stood the shock.</a>
<a id='line_11231'>  He stood, and, measuring first with careful eyes</a>
<a id='line_11232'>  The space his spear could reach, aloud he cries:</a>
<a id='line_11233'>  "My strong right hand, and sword, assist my stroke!</a>
<a id='line_11234'>  (Those only gods Mezentius will invoke.)</a>
<a id='line_11235'>  His armor, from the Trojan pirate torn,</a>
<a id='line_11236'>  By my triumphant Lausus shall be worn."</a>
<a id='line_11237'>  He said; and with his utmost force he threw</a>
<a id='line_11238'>  The massy spear, which, hissing as it flew,</a>
<a id='line_11239'>  Reach'd the celestial shield, that stopp'd the course;</a>
<a id='line_11240'>  But, glancing thence, the yet unbroken force</a>
<a id='line_11241'>  Took a new bent obliquely, and betwixt</a>
<a id='line_11242'>  The side and bowels fam'd Anthores fix'd.</a>
<a id='line_11243'>  Anthores had from Argos travel'd far,</a>
<a id='line_11244'>  Alcides' friend, and brother of the war;</a>
<a id='line_11245'>  Till, tir'd with toils, fair Italy he chose,</a>
<a id='line_11246'>  And in Evander's palace sought repose.</a>
<a id='line_11247'>  Now, falling by another's wound, his eyes</a>
<a id='line_11248'>  He cast to heav'n, on Argos thinks, and dies.</a>
<a id='line_11249'></a>
<a id='line_11250'>  The pious Trojan then his jav'lin sent;</a>
<a id='line_11251'>  The shield gave way; thro' treble plates it went</a>
<a id='line_11252'>  Of solid brass, of linen trebly roll'd,</a>
<a id='line_11253'>  And three bull hides which round the buckler fold.</a>
<a id='line_11254'>  All these it pass'd, resistless in the course,</a>
<a id='line_11255'>  Transpierc'd his thigh, and spent its dying force.</a>
<a id='line_11256'>  The gaping wound gush'd out a crimson flood.</a>
<a id='line_11257'>  The Trojan, glad with sight of hostile blood,</a>
<a id='line_11258'>  His faunchion drew, to closer fight address'd,</a>
<a id='line_11259'>  And with new force his fainting foe oppress'd.</a>
<a id='line_11260'></a>
<a id='line_11261'>  His father's peril Lausus view'd with grief;</a>
<a id='line_11262'>  He sigh'd, he wept, he ran to his relief.</a>
<a id='line_11263'>  And here, heroic youth, 't is here I must</a>
<a id='line_11264'>  To thy immortal memory be just,</a>
<a id='line_11265'>  And sing an act so noble and so new,</a>
<a id='line_11266'>  Posterity will scarce believe 't is true.</a>
<a id='line_11267'>  Pain'd with his wound, and useless for the fight,</a>
<a id='line_11268'>  The father sought to save himself by flight:</a>
<a id='line_11269'>  Incumber'd, slow he dragg'd the spear along,</a>
<a id='line_11270'>  Which pierc'd his thigh, and in his buckler hung.</a>
<a id='line_11271'>  The pious youth, resolv'd on death, below</a>
<a id='line_11272'>  The lifted sword springs forth to face the foe;</a>
<a id='line_11273'>  Protects his parent, and prevents the blow.</a>
<a id='line_11274'>  Shouts of applause ran ringing thro' the field,</a>
<a id='line_11275'>  To see the son the vanquish'd father shield.</a>
<a id='line_11276'>  All, fir'd with gen'rous indignation, strive,</a>
<a id='line_11277'>  And with a storm of darts to distance drive</a>
<a id='line_11278'>  The Trojan chief, who, held at bay from far,</a>
<a id='line_11279'>  On his Vulcanian orb sustain'd the war.</a>
<a id='line_11280'></a>
<a id='line_11281'>  As, when thick hail comes rattling in the wind,</a>
<a id='line_11282'>  The plowman, passenger, and lab'ring hind</a>
<a id='line_11283'>  For shelter to the neighb'ring covert fly,</a>

<a id='line_11286'>  Return to travel, and renew their toils:</a>
<a id='line_11287'>  Aeneas thus, o'erwhelmed on ev'ry side,</a>
<a id='line_11288'>  The storm of darts, undaunted, did abide;</a>
<a id='line_11289'>  And thus to Lausus loud with friendly threat'ning cried:</a>
<a id='line_11290'>  "Why wilt thou rush to certain death, and rage</a>
<a id='line_11291'>  In rash attempts, beyond thy tender age,</a>
<a id='line_11292'>  Betray'd by pious love?" Nor, thus forborne,</a>
<a id='line_11293'>  The youth desists, but with insulting scorn</a>
<a id='line_11294'>  Provokes the ling'ring prince, whose patience, tir'd,</a>
<a id='line_11295'>  Gave place; and all his breast with fury fir'd.</a>
<a id='line_11296'>  For now the Fates prepar'd their sharpen'd shears;</a>
<a id='line_11297'>  And lifted high the flaming sword appears,</a>
<a id='line_11298'>  Which, full descending with a frightful sway,</a>
<a id='line_11299'>  Thro' shield and corslet forc'd th' impetuous way,</a>
<a id='line_11300'>  And buried deep in his fair bosom lay.</a>
<a id='line_11301'>  The purple streams thro' the thin armor strove,</a>
<a id='line_11302'>  And drench'd th' imbroider'd coat his mother wove;</a>
<a id='line_11303'>  And life at length forsook his heaving heart,</a>
<a id='line_11304'>  Loth from so sweet a mansion to depart.</a>
<a id='line_11305'></a>
<a id='line_11306'>  But when, with blood and paleness all o'erspread,</a>
<a id='line_11307'>  The pious prince beheld young Lausus dead,</a>
<a id='line_11308'>  He griev'd; he wept; the sight an image brought</a>
<a id='line_11309'>  Of his own filial love, a sadly pleasing thought:</a>
<a id='line_11310'>  Then stretch'd his hand to hold him up, and said:</a>
<a id='line_11311'>  "Poor hapless youth! what praises can be paid</a>
<a id='line_11312'>  To love so great, to such transcendent store</a>
<a id='line_11313'>  Of early worth, and sure presage of more?</a>
<a id='line_11314'>  Accept whate'er Aeneas can afford;</a>
<a id='line_11315'>  Untouch'd thy arms, untaken be thy sword;</a>
<a id='line_11316'>  And all that pleas'd thee living, still remain</a>
<a id='line_11317'>  Inviolate, and sacred to the slain.</a>
<a id='line_11318'>  Thy body on thy parents I bestow,</a>
<a id='line_11319'>  To rest thy soul, at least, if shadows know,</a>
<a id='line_11320'>  Or have a sense of human things below.</a>
<a id='line_11321'>  There to thy fellow ghosts with glory tell:</a>
<a id='line_11322'>  ''T was by the great Aeneas hand I fell.'"</a>
<a id='line_11323'>  With this, his distant friends he beckons near,</a>
<a id='line_11324'>  Provokes their duty, and prevents their fear:</a>
<a id='line_11325'>  Himself assists to lift him from the ground,</a>
<a id='line_11326'>  With clotted locks, and blood that well'd from out the wound.</a>
<a id='line_11327'></a>
<a id='line_11328'>  Meantime, his father, now no father, stood,</a>
<a id='line_11329'>  And wash'd his wounds by Tiber's yellow flood:</a>
<a id='line_11330'>  Oppress'd with anguish, panting, and o'erspent,</a>
<a id='line_11331'>  His fainting limbs against an oak he leant.</a>
<a id='line_11332'>  A bough his brazen helmet did sustain;</a>
<a id='line_11333'>  His heavier arms lay scatter'd on the plain:</a>
<a id='line_11334'>  A chosen train of youth around him stand;</a>
<a id='line_11335'>  His drooping head was rested on his hand:</a>
<a id='line_11336'>  His grisly beard his pensive bosom sought;</a>
<a id='line_11337'>  And all on Lausus ran his restless thought.</a>
<a id='line_11338'>  Careful, concern'd his danger to prevent,</a>
<a id='line_11339'>  He much enquir'd, and many a message sent</a>
<a id='line_11340'>  To warn him from the field- alas! in vain!</a>
<a id='line_11341'>  Behold, his mournful followers bear him slain!</a>
<a id='line_11342'>  O'er his broad shield still gush'd the yawning wound,</a>
<a id='line_11343'>  And drew a bloody trail along the ground.</a>
<a id='line_11344'>  Far off he heard their cries, far off divin'd</a>
<a id='line_11345'>  The dire event, with a foreboding mind.</a>
<a id='line_11346'>  With dust he sprinkled first his hoary head;</a>
<a id='line_11347'>  Then both his lifted hands to heav'n he spread;</a>
<a id='line_11348'>  Last, the dear corpse embracing, thus he said:</a>
<a id='line_11349'>  "What joys, alas! could this frail being give,</a>
<a id='line_11350'>  That I have been so covetous to live?</a>
<a id='line_11351'>  To see my son, and such a son, resign</a>
<a id='line_11352'>  His life, a ransom for preserving mine!</a>
<a id='line_11353'>  And am I then preserv'd, and art thou lost?</a>
<a id='line_11354'>  How much too dear has that redemption cost!</a>
<a id='line_11355'>  'T is now my bitter banishment I feel:</a>
<a id='line_11356'>  This is a wound too deep for time to heal.</a>
<a id='line_11357'>  My guilt thy growing virtues did defame;</a>
<a id='line_11358'>  My blackness blotted thy unblemish'd name.</a>
<a id='line_11359'>  Chas'd from a throne, abandon'd, and exil'd</a>
<a id='line_11360'>  For foul misdeeds, were punishments too mild:</a>
<a id='line_11361'>  I ow'd my people these, and, from their hate,</a>
<a id='line_11362'>  With less resentment could have borne my fate.</a>
<a id='line_11363'>  And yet I live, and yet sustain the sight</a>
<a id='line_11364'>  Of hated men, and of more hated light:</a>
<a id='line_11365'>  But will not long." With that he rais'd from ground</a>
<a id='line_11366'>  His fainting limbs, that stagger'd with his wound;</a>
<a id='line_11367'>  Yet, with a mind resolv'd, and unappall'd</a>
<a id='line_11368'>  With pains or perils, for his courser call'd</a>
<a id='line_11369'>  Well-mouth'd, well-manag'd, whom himself did dress</a>
<a id='line_11370'>  With daily care, and mounted with success;</a>
<a id='line_11371'>  His aid in arms, his ornament in peace.</a>
<a id='line_11372'></a>
<a id='line_11373'>  Soothing his courage with a gentle stroke,</a>
<a id='line_11374'>  The steed seem'd sensible, while thus he spoke:</a>
<a id='line_11375'>  "O Rhoebus, we have liv'd too long for me-</a>
<a id='line_11376'>  If life and long were terms that could agree!</a>
<a id='line_11377'>  This day thou either shalt bring back the head</a>
<a id='line_11378'>  And bloody trophies of the Trojan dead;</a>
<a id='line_11379'>  This day thou either shalt revenge my woe,</a>
<a id='line_11380'>  For murther'd Lausus, on his cruel foe;</a>
<a id='line_11381'>  Or, if inexorable fate deny</a>
<a id='line_11382'>  Our conquest, with thy conquer'd master die:</a>
<a id='line_11383'>  For, after such a lord, I rest secure,</a>
<a id='line_11384'>  Thou wilt no foreign reins, or Trojan load endure."</a>
<a id='line_11385'>  He said; and straight th' officious courser kneels,</a>
<a id='line_11386'>  To take his wonted weight. His hands he fills</a>
<a id='line_11387'>  With pointed jav'lins; on his head he lac'd</a>
<a id='line_11388'>  His glitt'ring helm, which terribly was grac'd</a>
<a id='line_11389'>  With waving horsehair, nodding from afar;</a>
<a id='line_11390'>  Then spurr'd his thund'ring steed amidst the war.</a>
<a id='line_11391'>  Love, anguish, wrath, and grief, to madness wrought,</a>
<a id='line_11392'>  Despair, and secret shame, and conscious thought</a>
<a id='line_11393'>  Of inborn worth, his lab'ring soul oppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_11394'>  Roll'd in his eyes, and rag'd within his breast.</a>
<a id='line_11395'>  Then loud he call'd Aeneas thrice by name:</a>
<a id='line_11396'>  The loud repeated voice to glad Aeneas came.</a>
<a id='line_11397'>  "Great Jove," he said, "and the far-shooting god,</a>
<a id='line_11398'>  Inspire thy mind to make thy challenge good!"</a>
<a id='line_11399'>  He spoke no more; but hasten'd, void of fear,</a>
<a id='line_11400'>  And threaten'd with his long protended spear.</a>
<a id='line_11401'></a>
<a id='line_11402'>  To whom Mezentius thus: "Thy vaunts are vain.</a>
<a id='line_11403'>  My Lausus lies extended on the plain:</a>
<a id='line_11404'>  He's lost! thy conquest is already won;</a>
<a id='line_11405'>  The wretched sire is murther'd in the son.</a>
<a id='line_11406'>  Nor fate I fear, but all the gods defy.</a>
<a id='line_11407'>  Forbear thy threats: my bus'ness is to die;</a>
<a id='line_11408'>  But first receive this parting legacy."</a>
<a id='line_11409'>  He said; and straight a whirling dart he sent;</a>
<a id='line_11410'>  Another after, and another went.</a>
<a id='line_11411'>  Round in a spacious ring he rides the field,</a>
<a id='line_11412'>  And vainly plies th' impenetrable shield.</a>
<a id='line_11413'>  Thrice rode he round; and thrice Aeneas wheel'd,</a>
<a id='line_11414'>  Turn'd as he turn'd: the golden orb withstood</a>
<a id='line_11415'>  The strokes, and bore about an iron wood.</a>
<a id='line_11416'>  Impatient of delay, and weary grown,</a>
<a id='line_11417'>  Still to defend, and to defend alone,</a>
<a id='line_11418'>  To wrench the darts which in his buckler light,</a>
<a id='line_11419'>  Urg'd and o'er-labor'd in unequal fight;</a>
<a id='line_11420'>  At length resolv'd, he throws with all his force</a>
<a id='line_11421'>  Full at the temples of the warrior horse.</a>
<a id='line_11422'>  Just where the stroke was aim'd, th' unerring spear</a>
<a id='line_11423'>  Made way, and stood transfix'd thro' either ear.</a>
<a id='line_11424'>  Seiz'd with unwonted pain, surpris'd with fright,</a>
<a id='line_11425'>  The wounded steed curvets, and, rais'd upright,</a>
<a id='line_11426'>  Lights on his feet before; his hoofs behind</a>
<a id='line_11427'>  Spring up in air aloft, and lash the wind.</a>
<a id='line_11428'>  Down comes the rider headlong from his height:</a>
<a id='line_11429'>  His horse came after with unwieldy weight,</a>
<a id='line_11430'>  And, flound'ring forward, pitching on his head,</a>
<a id='line_11431'>  His lord's incumber'd shoulder overlaid.</a>
<a id='line_11432'></a>
<a id='line_11433'>  From either host, the mingled shouts and cries</a>
<a id='line_11434'>  Of Trojans and Rutulians rend the skies.</a>
<a id='line_11435'>  Aeneas, hast'ning, wav'd his fatal sword</a>
<a id='line_11436'>  High o'er his head, with this reproachful word:</a>
<a id='line_11437'>  "Now; where are now thy vaunts, the fierce disdain</a>
<a id='line_11438'>  Of proud Mezentius, and the lofty strain?"</a>
<a id='line_11439'></a>
<a id='line_11440'>  Struggling, and wildly staring on the skies,</a>
<a id='line_11441'>  With scarce recover'd sight he thus replies:</a>
<a id='line_11442'>  "Why these insulting words, this waste of breath,</a>
<a id='line_11443'>  To souls undaunted, and secure of death?</a>
<a id='line_11444'>  'T is no dishonor for the brave to die,</a>
<a id='line_11445'>  Nor came I here with hope victory;</a>
<a id='line_11446'>  Nor ask I life, nor fought with that design:</a>
<a id='line_11447'>  As I had us'd my fortune, use thou thine.</a>
<a id='line_11448'>  My dying son contracted no such band;</a>
<a id='line_11449'>  The gift is hateful from his murd'rer's hand.</a>
<a id='line_11450'>  For this, this only favor let me sue,</a>
<a id='line_11451'>  If pity can to conquer'd foes be due:</a>
<a id='line_11452'>  Refuse it not; but let my body have</a>
<a id='line_11453'>  The last retreat of humankind, a grave.</a>
<a id='line_11454'>  Too well I know th' insulting people's hate;</a>
<a id='line_11455'>  Protect me from their vengeance after fate:</a>
<a id='line_11456'>  This refuge for my poor remains provide,</a>
<a id='line_11457'>  And lay my much-lov'd Lausus by my side."</a>
<a id='line_11458'>  He said, and to the sword his throat applied.</a>
<a id='line_11459'>  The crimson stream distain'd his arms around,</a>
<a id='line_11460'>  And the disdainful soul came rushing thro' the wound.</a>

<a id='line_11510'></a>
<a id='line_11511'>  Thus, weeping while he spoke, he took his way,</a>
<a id='line_11512'>  Where, new in death, lamented Pallas lay.</a>
<a id='line_11513'>  Acoetes watch'd the corpse; whose youth deserv'd</a>

<a id='line_11525'>  First, melting into tears, the pious man</a>

<a id='line_11528'>  Of my full wishes, she refus'd the best!</a>
<a id='line_11529'>  She came; but brought not thee along, to bless</a>
<a id='line_11530'>  My longing eyes, and share in my success:</a>

<a id='line_11534'>  Thy needless succor with a sad consent;</a>
<a id='line_11535'>  Embrac'd me, parting for th' Etrurian land,</a>
<a id='line_11536'>  And sent me to possess a large command.</a>
<a id='line_11537'>  He warn'd, and from his own experience told,</a>
<a id='line_11538'>  Our foes were warlike, disciplin'd, and bold.</a>
<a id='line_11539'>  And now perhaps, in hopes of thy return,</a>
<a id='line_11540'>  Rich odors on his loaded altars burn,</a>
<a id='line_11541'>  While we, with vain officious pomp, prepare</a>
<a id='line_11542'>  To send him back his portion of the war,</a>
<a id='line_11543'>  A bloody breathless body, which can owe</a>
<a id='line_11544'>  No farther debt, but to the pow'rs below.</a>
<a id='line_11545'>  The wretched father, ere his race is run,</a>
<a id='line_11546'>  Shall view the fun'ral honors of his son.</a>
<a id='line_11547'>  These are my triumphs of the Latian war,</a>
<a id='line_11548'>  Fruits of my plighted faith and boasted care!</a>
<a id='line_11549'>  And yet, unhappy sire, thou shalt not see</a>
<a id='line_11550'>  A son whose death disgrac'd his ancestry;</a>
<a id='line_11551'>  Thou shalt not blush, old man, however griev'd:</a>
<a id='line_11552'>  Thy Pallas no dishonest wound receiv'd.</a>
<a id='line_11553'>  He died no death to make thee wish, too late,</a>
<a id='line_11554'>  Thou hadst not liv'd to see his shameful fate:</a>
<a id='line_11555'>  But what a champion has th' Ausonian coast,</a>
<a id='line_11556'>  And what a friend hast thou, Ascanius, lost!"</a>
<a id='line_11557'></a>
<a id='line_11558'>  Thus having mourn'd, he gave the word around,</a>
<a id='line_11559'>  To raise the breathless body from the ground;</a>
<a id='line_11560'>  And chose a thousand horse, the flow'r of all</a>
<a id='line_11561'>  His warlike troops, to wait the funeral,</a>
<a id='line_11562'>  To bear him back and share Evander's grief:</a>
<a id='line_11563'>  A well-becoming, but a weak relief.</a>
<a id='line_11564'>  Of oaken twigs they twist an easy bier,</a>
<a id='line_11565'>  Then on their shoulders the sad burden rear.</a>
<a id='line_11566'>  The body on this rural hearse is borne:</a>
<a id='line_11567'>  Strew'd leaves and funeral greens the bier adorn.</a>
<a id='line_11568'>  All pale he lies, and looks a lovely flow'r,</a>
<a id='line_11569'>  New cropp'd by virgin hands, to dress the bow'r:</a>
<a id='line_11570'>  Unfaded yet, but yet unfed below,</a>
<a id='line_11571'>  No more to mother earth or the green stern shall owe.</a>
<a id='line_11572'>  Then two fair vests, of wondrous work and cost,</a>
<a id='line_11573'>  Of purple woven, and with gold emboss'd,</a>
<a id='line_11574'>  For ornament the Trojan hero brought,</a>
<a id='line_11575'>  Which with her hands Sidonian Dido wrought.</a>
<a id='line_11576'>  One vest array'd the corpse; and one they spread</a>
<a id='line_11577'>  O'er his clos'd eyes, and wrapp'd around his head,</a>
<a id='line_11578'>  That, when the yellow hair in flame should fall,</a>
<a id='line_11579'>  The catching fire might burn the golden caul.</a>
<a id='line_11580'>  Besides, the spoils of foes in battle slain,</a>
<a id='line_11581'>  When he descended on the Latian plain;</a>
<a id='line_11582'>  Arms, trappings, horses, by the hearse are led</a>
<a id='line_11583'>  In long array- th' achievements of the dead.</a>
<a id='line_11584'>  Then, pinion'd with their hands behind, appear</a>
<a id='line_11585'>  Th' unhappy captives, marching in the rear,</a>

<a id='line_11603'>  Stripp'd of his trappings, with a sullen pace</a>

<a id='line_11605'>  The lance of Pallas, and the crimson crest,</a>
<a id='line_11606'>  Are borne behind: the victor seiz'd the rest.</a>
<a id='line_11607'>  The march begins: the trumpets hoarsely sound;</a>
<a id='line_11608'>  The pikes and lances trail along the ground.</a>
<a id='line_11609'>  Thus while the Trojan and Arcadian horse</a>
<a id='line_11610'>  To Pallantean tow'rs direct their course,</a>
<a id='line_11611'>  In long procession rank'd, the pious chief</a>
<a id='line_11612'>  Stopp'd in the rear, and gave a vent to grief:</a>
<a id='line_11613'>  "The public care," he said, "which war attends,</a>

<a id='line_11615'>  Peace with the manes of great Pallas dwell!</a>
<a id='line_11616'>  Hail, holy relics! and a last farewell!"</a>
<a id='line_11617'>  He said no more, but, inly thro' he mourn'd,</a>
<a id='line_11618'>  Restrained his tears, and to the camp return'd.</a>
<a id='line_11619'></a>
<a id='line_11620'>  Now suppliants, from Laurentum sent, demand</a>
<a id='line_11621'>  A truce, with olive branches in their hand;</a>
<a id='line_11622'>  Obtest his clemency, and from the plain</a>
<a id='line_11623'>  Beg leave to draw the bodies of their slain.</a>
<a id='line_11624'>  They plead, that none those common rites deny</a>
<a id='line_11625'>  To conquer'd foes that in fair battle die.</a>
<a id='line_11626'>  All cause of hate was ended in their death;</a>
<a id='line_11627'>  Nor could he war with bodies void of breath.</a>
<a id='line_11628'>  A king, they hop'd, would hear a king's request,</a>
<a id='line_11629'>  Whose son he once was call'd, and once his guest.</a>
<a id='line_11630'></a>
<a id='line_11631'>  Their suit, which was too just to be denied,</a>
<a id='line_11632'>  The hero grants, and farther thus replied:</a>
<a id='line_11633'>  "O Latian princes, how severe a fate</a>
<a id='line_11634'>  In causeless quarrels has involv'd your state,</a>
<a id='line_11635'>  And arm'd against an unoffending man,</a>
<a id='line_11636'>  Who sought your friendship ere the war began!</a>
<a id='line_11637'>  You beg a truce, which I would gladly give,</a>
<a id='line_11638'>  Not only for the slain, but those who live.</a>
<a id='line_11639'>  I came not hither but by Heav'n's command,</a>
<a id='line_11640'>  And sent by fate to share the Latian land.</a>
<a id='line_11641'>  Nor wage I wars unjust: your king denied</a>
<a id='line_11642'>  My proffer'd friendship, and my promis'd bride;</a>
<a id='line_11643'>  Left me for Turnus. Turnus then should try</a>
<a id='line_11644'>  His cause in arms, to conquer or to die.</a>
<a id='line_11645'>  My right and his are in dispute: the slain</a>
<a id='line_11646'>  Fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain.</a>
<a id='line_11647'>  In equal arms let us alone contend;</a>
<a id='line_11648'>  And let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend.</a>
<a id='line_11649'>  This is the way (so tell him) to possess</a>
<a id='line_11650'>  The royal virgin, and restore the peace.</a>
<a id='line_11651'>  Bear this message back, with ample leave,</a>
<a id='line_11652'>  That your slain friends may fun'ral rites receive."</a>
<a id='line_11653'></a>
<a id='line_11654'>  Thus having said- th' embassadors, amaz'd,</a>
<a id='line_11655'>  Stood mute a while, and on each other gaz'd.</a>
<a id='line_11656'>  Drances, their chief, who harbor'd in his breast</a>
<a id='line_11657'>  Long hate to Turnus, as his foe profess'd,</a>
<a id='line_11658'>  Broke silence first, and to the godlike man,</a>
<a id='line_11659'>  With graceful action bowing, thus began:</a>
<a id='line_11660'>  "Auspicious prince, in arms a mighty name,</a>
<a id='line_11661'>  But yet whose actions far transcend your fame;</a>
<a id='line_11662'>  Would I your justice or your force express,</a>
<a id='line_11663'>  Thought can but equal; and all words are less.</a>
<a id='line_11664'>  Your answer we shall thankfully relate,</a>
<a id='line_11665'>  And favors granted to the Latian state.</a>
<a id='line_11666'>  If wish'd success our labor shall attend,</a>
<a id='line_11667'>  Think peace concluded, and the king your friend:</a>
<a id='line_11668'>  Let Turnus leave the realm to your command,</a>
<a id='line_11669'>  And seek alliance in some other land:</a>
<a id='line_11670'>  Build you the city which your fates assign;</a>
<a id='line_11671'>  We shall be proud in the great work to join."</a>
<a id='line_11672'></a>
<a id='line_11673'>  Thus Drances; and his words so well persuade</a>
<a id='line_11674'>  The rest impower'd, that soon a truce is made.</a>
<a id='line_11675'>  Twelve days the term allow'd: and, during those,</a>
<a id='line_11676'>  Latians and Trojans, now no longer foes,</a>
<a id='line_11677'>  Mix'd in the woods, for fun'ral piles prepare</a>
<a id='line_11678'>  To fell the timber, and forget the war.</a>
<a id='line_11679'>  Loud axes thro' the groaning groves resound;</a>
<a id='line_11680'>  Oak, mountain ash, and poplar spread the ground;</a>
<a id='line_11681'>  First fall from high; and some the trunks receive</a>
<a id='line_11682'>  In loaden wains; with wedges some they cleave.</a>
<a id='line_11683'></a>
<a id='line_11684'>  And now the fatal news by Fame is blown</a>
<a id='line_11685'>  Thro' the short circuit of th' Arcadian town,</a>
<a id='line_11686'>  Of Pallas slain- by Fame, which just before</a>
<a id='line_11687'>  His triumphs on distended pinions bore.</a>
<a id='line_11688'>  Rushing from out the gate, the people stand,</a>
<a id='line_11689'>  Each with a fun'ral flambeau in his hand.</a>
<a id='line_11690'>  Wildly they stare, distracted with amaze:</a>
<a id='line_11691'>  The fields are lighten'd with a fiery blaze,</a>
<a id='line_11692'>  That cast a sullen splendor on their friends,</a>
<a id='line_11693'>  The marching troop which their dead prince attends.</a>
<a id='line_11694'>  Both parties meet: they raise a doleful cry;</a>
<a id='line_11695'>  The matrons from the walls with shrieks reply,</a>
<a id='line_11696'>  And their mix'd mourning rends the vaulted sky.</a>
<a id='line_11697'>  The town is fill'd with tumult and with tears,</a>
<a id='line_11698'>  Till the loud clamors reach Evander's ears:</a>
<a id='line_11699'>  Forgetful of his state, he runs along,</a>
<a id='line_11700'>  With a disorder'd pace, and cleaves the throng;</a>
<a id='line_11701'>  Falls on the corpse; and groaning there he lies,</a>
<a id='line_11702'>  With silent grief, that speaks but at his eyes.</a>
<a id='line_11703'>  Short sighs and sobs succeed; till sorrow breaks</a>
<a id='line_11704'>  A passage, and at once he weeps and speaks:</a>
<a id='line_11705'></a>
<a id='line_11706'>  "O Pallas! thou hast fail'd thy plighted word,</a>
<a id='line_11707'>  To fight with caution, not to tempt the sword!</a>
<a id='line_11708'>  I warn'd thee, but in vain; for well I knew</a>
<a id='line_11709'>  What perils youthful ardor would pursue,</a>
<a id='line_11710'>  That boiling blood would carry thee too far,</a>
<a id='line_11711'>  Young as thou wert in dangers, raw to war!</a>
<a id='line_11712'>  O curst essay of arms, disastrous doom,</a>
<a id='line_11713'>  Prelude of bloody fields, and fights to come!</a>
<a id='line_11714'>  Hard elements of unauspicious war,</a>
<a id='line_11715'>  Vain vows to Heav'n, and unavailing care!</a>
<a id='line_11716'>  Thrice happy thou, dear partner of my bed,</a>
<a id='line_11717'>  Whose holy soul the stroke of Fortune fled,</a>
<a id='line_11718'>  Praescious of ills, and leaving me behind,</a>
<a id='line_11719'>  To drink the dregs of life by fate assign'd!</a>
<a id='line_11720'>  Beyond the goal of nature I have gone:</a>
<a id='line_11721'>  My Pallas late set out, but reach'd too soon.</a>
<a id='line_11722'>  If, for my league against th' Ausonian state,</a>
<a id='line_11723'>  Amidst their weapons I had found my fate,</a>
<a id='line_11724'>  (Deserv'd from them,) then I had been return'd</a>
<a id='line_11725'>  A breathless victor, and my son had mourn'd.</a>
<a id='line_11726'>  Yet will I not my Trojan friend upbraid,</a>
<a id='line_11727'>  Nor grudge th' alliance I so gladly made.</a>
<a id='line_11728'>  'T was not his fault, my Pallas fell so young,</a>
<a id='line_11729'>  But my own crime, for having liv'd too long.</a>
<a id='line_11730'>  Yet, since the gods had destin'd him to die,</a>
<a id='line_11731'>  At least he led the way to victory:</a>
<a id='line_11732'>  First for his friends he won the fatal shore,</a>
<a id='line_11733'>  And sent whole herds of slaughter'd foes before;</a>
<a id='line_11734'>  A death too great, too glorious to deplore.</a>
<a id='line_11735'>  Nor will I add new honors to thy grave,</a>
<a id='line_11736'>  Content with those the Trojan hero gave:</a>
<a id='line_11737'>  That funeral pomp thy Phrygian friends design'd,</a>
<a id='line_11738'>  In which the Tuscan chiefs and army join'd.</a>
<a id='line_11739'>  Great spoils and trophies, gain'd by thee, they bear:</a>
<a id='line_11740'>  Then let thy own achievements be thy share.</a>
<a id='line_11741'>  Even thou, O Turnus, hadst a trophy stood,</a>
<a id='line_11742'>  Whose mighty trunk had better grac'd the wood,</a>
<a id='line_11743'>  If Pallas had arriv'd, with equal length</a>
<a id='line_11744'>  Of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength.</a>
<a id='line_11745'>  But why, unhappy man, dost thou detain</a>
<a id='line_11746'>  These troops, to view the tears thou shedd'st in vain?</a>
<a id='line_11747'>  Go, friends, this message to your lord relate:</a>
<a id='line_11748'>  Tell him, that, if I bear my bitter fate,</a>
<a id='line_11749'>  And, after Pallas' death, live ling'ring on,</a>
<a id='line_11750'>  'T is to behold his vengeance for my son.</a>
<a id='line_11751'>  I stay for Turnus, whose devoted head</a>
<a id='line_11752'>  Is owing to the living and the dead.</a>
<a id='line_11753'>  My son and I expect it from his hand;</a>
<a id='line_11754'>  'T is all that he can give, or we demand.</a>
<a id='line_11755'>  Joy is no more; but I would gladly go,</a>
<a id='line_11756'>  To greet my Pallas with such news below."</a>
<a id='line_11757'></a>
<a id='line_11758'>  The morn had now dispell'd the shades of night,</a>
<a id='line_11759'>  Restoring toils, when she restor'd the light.</a>
<a id='line_11760'>  The Trojan king and Tuscan chief command</a>
<a id='line_11761'>  To raise the piles along the winding strand.</a>
<a id='line_11762'>  Their friends convey the dead fun'ral fires;</a>
<a id='line_11763'>  Black smold'ring smoke from the green wood expires;</a>
<a id='line_11764'>  The light of heav'n is chok'd, and the new day retires.</a>
<a id='line_11765'>  Then thrice around the kindled piles they go</a>
<a id='line_11766'>  (For ancient custom had ordain'd it so)</a>
<a id='line_11767'>  Thrice horse and foot about the fires are led;</a>
<a id='line_11768'>  And thrice, with loud laments, they hail the dead.</a>
<a id='line_11769'>  Tears, trickling down their breasts, bedew the ground,</a>
<a id='line_11770'>  And drums and trumpets mix their mournful sound.</a>
<a id='line_11771'>  Amid the blaze, their pious brethren throw</a>
<a id='line_11772'>  The spoils, in battle taken from the foe:</a>
<a id='line_11773'>  Helms, bits emboss'd, and swords of shining steel;</a>
<a id='line_11774'>  One casts a target, one a chariot wheel;</a>
<a id='line_11775'>  Some to their fellows their own arms restore:</a>
<a id='line_11776'>  The fauchions which in luckless fight they bore,</a>
<a id='line_11777'>  Their bucklers pierc'd, their darts bestow'd in vain,</a>
<a id='line_11778'>  And shiver'd lances gather'd from the plain.</a>
<a id='line_11779'>  Whole herds of offer'd bulls, about the fire,</a>
<a id='line_11780'>  And bristled boars, and woolly sheep expire.</a>
<a id='line_11781'>  Around the piles a careful troop attends,</a>
<a id='line_11782'>  To watch the wasting flames, and weep their burning friends;</a>
<a id='line_11783'>  Ling'ring along the shore, till dewy night</a>
<a id='line_11784'>  New decks the face of heav'n with starry light.</a>
<a id='line_11785'></a>
<a id='line_11786'>  The conquer'd Latians, with like pious care,</a>
<a id='line_11787'>  Piles without number for their dead prepare.</a>
<a id='line_11788'>  Part in the places where they fell are laid;</a>
<a id='line_11789'>  And part are to the neighb'ring fields convey'd.</a>
<a id='line_11790'>  The corps of kings, and captains of renown,</a>
<a id='line_11791'>  Borne off in state, are buried in the town;</a>
<a id='line_11792'>  The rest, unhonor'd, and without a name,</a>
<a id='line_11793'>  Are cast a common heap to feed the flame.</a>
<a id='line_11794'>  Trojans and Latians vie with like desires</a>
<a id='line_11795'>  To make the field of battle shine with fires,</a>
<a id='line_11796'>  And the promiscuous blaze to heav'n aspires.</a>
<a id='line_11797'></a>
<a id='line_11798'>  Now had the morning thrice renew'd the light,</a>
<a id='line_11799'>  And thrice dispell'd the shadows of the night,</a>
<a id='line_11800'>  When those who round the wasted fires remain,</a>
<a id='line_11801'>  Perform the last sad office to the slain.</a>
<a id='line_11802'>  They rake the yet warm ashes from below;</a>
<a id='line_11803'>  These, and the bones unburn'd, in earth bestow;</a>
<a id='line_11804'>  These relics with their country rites they grace,</a>

<a id='line_11806'></a>
<a id='line_11807'>  But, in the palace of the king, appears</a>
<a id='line_11808'>  A scene more solemn, and a pomp of tears.</a>
<a id='line_11809'>  Maids, matrons, widows, mix their common moans;</a>
<a id='line_11810'>  Orphans their sires, and sires lament their sons.</a>
<a id='line_11811'>  All in that universal sorrow share,</a>
<a id='line_11812'>  And curse the cause of this unhappy war:</a>
<a id='line_11813'>  A broken league, a bride unjustly sought,</a>
<a id='line_11814'>  A crown usurp'd, which with their blood is bought!</a>
<a id='line_11815'>  These are the crimes with which they load the name</a>
<a id='line_11816'>  Of Turnus, and on him alone exclaim:</a>
<a id='line_11817'>  "Let him who lords it o'er th' Ausonian land</a>
<a id='line_11818'>  Engage the Trojan hero hand to hand:</a>
<a id='line_11819'>  His is the gain; our lot is but to serve;</a>
<a id='line_11820'>  'T is just, the sway he seeks, he should deserve."</a>
<a id='line_11821'>  This Drances aggravates; and adds, with spite:</a>
<a id='line_11822'>  "His foe expects, and dares him to the fight."</a>
<a id='line_11823'>  Nor Turnus wants a party, to support</a>

<a id='line_11825'>  His former acts secure his present fame,</a>
<a id='line_11826'>  And the queen shades him with her mighty name.</a>

<a id='line_11828'>  While thus their factious minds with fury burn,</a>
<a id='line_11829'>  The legates from th' Aetolian prince return:</a>

<a id='line_11832'>  That Diomedes refus'd his aid in war,</a>
<a id='line_11833'>  Unmov'd with presents, and as deaf to pray'r.</a>
<a id='line_11834'>  Some new alliance must elsewhere be sought,</a>
<a id='line_11835'>  Or peace with Troy on hard conditions bought.</a>
<a id='line_11836'></a>
<a id='line_11837'>  Latinus, sunk in sorrow, finds too late,</a>
<a id='line_11838'>  A foreign son is pointed out by fate;</a>
<a id='line_11839'>  And, till Aeneas shall Lavinia wed,</a>

<a id='line_11844'>  Thus, full of anxious thought, he summons all</a>
<a id='line_11845'>  The Latian senate to the council hall.</a>
<a id='line_11846'>  The princes come, commanded by their head,</a>
<a id='line_11847'>  And crowd the paths that to the palace lead.</a>

<a id='line_11849'>  He takes the throne, and in the midst appears.</a>
<a id='line_11850'>  Majestically sad, he sits in state,</a>
<a id='line_11851'>  And bids his envoys their success relate.</a>
<a id='line_11852'></a>
<a id='line_11853'>  When Venulus began, the murmuring sound</a>
<a id='line_11854'>  Was hush'd, and sacred silence reign'd around.</a>
<a id='line_11855'>  "We have," said he, "perform'd your high command,</a>

<a id='line_12176'>  In battle marching by the river side,</a>
<a id='line_12177'>  And bending to the town. They take th' alarm:</a>
<a id='line_12178'>  Some tremble, some are bold; all in confusion arm.</a>
<a id='line_12179'>  Th' impetuous youth press forward to the field;</a>
<a id='line_12180'>  They clash the sword, and clatter on the shield:</a>
<a id='line_12181'>  The fearful matrons raise a screaming cry;</a>
<a id='line_12182'>  Old feeble men with fainter groans reply;</a>
<a id='line_12183'>  A jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky,</a>
<a id='line_12184'>  Like that of swans remurm'ring to the floods,</a>
<a id='line_12185'>  Or birds of diff'ring kinds in hollow woods.</a>
<a id='line_12186'></a>
<a id='line_12187'>  Turnus th' occasion takes, and cries aloud:</a>
<a id='line_12188'>  "Talk on, ye quaint haranguers of the crowd:</a>
<a id='line_12189'>  Declaim in praise of peace, when danger calls,</a>
<a id='line_12190'>  And the fierce foes in arms approach the walls."</a>
<a id='line_12191'>  He said, and, turning short, with speedy pace,</a>
<a id='line_12192'>  Casts back a scornful glance, and quits the place:</a>
<a id='line_12193'>  "Thou, Volusus, the Volscian troops command</a>
<a id='line_12194'>  To mount; and lead thyself our Ardean band.</a>
<a id='line_12195'>  Messapus and Catillus, post your force</a>
<a id='line_12196'>  Along the fields, to charge the Trojan horse.</a>
<a id='line_12197'>  Some guard the passes, others man the wall;</a>
<a id='line_12198'>  Drawn up in arms, the rest attend my call."</a>
<a id='line_12199'></a>
<a id='line_12200'>  They swarm from ev'ry quarter of the town,</a>
<a id='line_12201'>  And with disorder'd haste the rampires crown.</a>
<a id='line_12202'>  Good old Latinus, when he saw, too late,</a>
<a id='line_12203'>  The gath'ring storm just breaking on the state,</a>
<a id='line_12204'>  Dismiss'd the council till a fitter time,</a>
<a id='line_12205'>  And own'd his easy temper as his crime,</a>
<a id='line_12206'>  Who, forc'd against his reason, had complied</a>
<a id='line_12207'>  To break the treaty for the promis'd bride.</a>
<a id='line_12208'></a>
<a id='line_12209'>  Some help to sink new trenches; others aid</a>
<a id='line_12210'>  To ram the stones, or raise the palisade.</a>
<a id='line_12211'>  Hoarse trumpets sound th' alarm; around the walls</a>
<a id='line_12212'>  Runs a distracted crew, whom their last labor calls.</a>
<a id='line_12213'>  A sad procession in the streets is seen,</a>
<a id='line_12214'>  Of matrons, that attend the mother queen:</a>
<a id='line_12215'>  High in her chair she sits, and, at her side,</a>
<a id='line_12216'>  With downcast eyes, appears the fatal bride.</a>
<a id='line_12217'>  They mount the cliff, where Pallas' temple stands;</a>
<a id='line_12218'>  Pray'rs in their mouths, and presents in their hands,</a>
<a id='line_12219'>  With censers first they fume the sacred shrine,</a>
<a id='line_12220'>  Then in this common supplication join:</a>
<a id='line_12221'>  "O patroness of arms, unspotted maid,</a>
<a id='line_12222'>  Propitious hear, and lend thy Latins aid!</a>
<a id='line_12223'>  Break short the pirate's lance; pronounce his fate,</a>
<a id='line_12224'>  And lay the Phrygian low before the gate."</a>
<a id='line_12225'></a>
<a id='line_12226'>  Now Turnus arms for fight. His back and breast</a>
<a id='line_12227'>  Well-temper'd steel and scaly brass invest:</a>
<a id='line_12228'>  The cuishes which his brawny thighs infold</a>
<a id='line_12229'>  Are mingled metal damask'd o'er with gold.</a>
<a id='line_12230'>  His faithful fauchion sits upon his side;</a>
<a id='line_12231'>  Nor casque, nor crest, his manly features hide:</a>
<a id='line_12232'>  But, bare to view, amid surrounding friends,</a>
<a id='line_12233'>  With godlike grace, he from the tow'r descends.</a>
<a id='line_12234'>  Exulting in his strength, he seems to dare</a>
<a id='line_12235'>  His absent rival, and to promise war.</a>
<a id='line_12236'>  Freed from his keepers, thus, with broken reins,</a>
<a id='line_12237'>  The wanton courser prances o'er the plains,</a>
<a id='line_12238'>  Or in the pride of youth o'erleaps the mounds,</a>
<a id='line_12239'>  And snuffs the females in forbidden grounds.</a>
<a id='line_12240'>  Or seeks his wat'ring in the well-known flood,</a>
<a id='line_12241'>  To quench his thirst, and cool his fiery blood:</a>
<a id='line_12242'>  He swims luxuriant in the liquid plain,</a>
<a id='line_12243'>  And o'er his shoulder flows his waving mane:</a>
<a id='line_12244'>  He neighs, he snorts, he bears his head on high;</a>
<a id='line_12245'>  Before his ample chest the frothy waters fly.</a>
<a id='line_12246'></a>
<a id='line_12247'>  Soon as the prince appears without the gate,</a>
<a id='line_12248'>  The Volscians, with their virgin leader, wait</a>
<a id='line_12249'>  His last commands. Then, with a graceful mien,</a>
<a id='line_12250'>  Lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen:</a>
<a id='line_12251'>  Her squadron imitates, and each descends;</a>
<a id='line_12252'>  Whose common suit Camilla thus commends:</a>
<a id='line_12253'>  "If sense of honor, if a soul secure</a>
<a id='line_12254'>  Of inborn worth, that can all tests endure,</a>
<a id='line_12255'>  Can promise aught, or on itself rely</a>
<a id='line_12256'>  Greatly to dare, to conquer or to die;</a>
<a id='line_12257'>  Then, I alone, sustain'd by these, will meet</a>
<a id='line_12258'>  The Tyrrhene troops, and promise their defeat.</a>
<a id='line_12259'>  Ours be the danger, ours the sole renown:</a>
<a id='line_12260'>  You, gen'ral, stay behind, and guard the town:"</a>
<a id='line_12261'></a>
<a id='line_12262'>  Turnus a while stood mute, with glad surprise,</a>
<a id='line_12263'>  And on the fierce virago fix'd his eyes;</a>
<a id='line_12264'>  Then thus return'd: "O grace of Italy,</a>
<a id='line_12265'>  With what becoming thanks can I reply?</a>
<a id='line_12266'>  Not only words lie lab'ring in my breast,</a>
<a id='line_12267'>  But thought itself is by thy praise oppress'd.</a>
<a id='line_12268'>  Yet rob me not of all; but let me join</a>
<a id='line_12269'>  My toils, my hazard, and my fame, with thine.</a>
<a id='line_12270'>  The Trojan, not in stratagem unskill'd,</a>
<a id='line_12271'>  Sends his light horse before to scour the field:</a>
<a id='line_12272'>  Himself, thro' steep ascents and thorny brakes,</a>
<a id='line_12273'>  A larger compass to the city takes.</a>
<a id='line_12274'>  This news my scouts confirm, and I prepare</a>
<a id='line_12275'>  To foil his cunning, and his force to dare;</a>
<a id='line_12276'>  With chosen foot his passage to forelay,</a>
<a id='line_12277'>  And place an ambush in the winding way.</a>
<a id='line_12278'>  Thou, with thy Volscians, face the Tuscan horse;</a>
<a id='line_12279'>  The brave Messapus shall thy troops inforce</a>
<a id='line_12280'>  With those of Tibur, and the Latian band,</a>
<a id='line_12281'>  Subjected all to thy supreme command."</a>
<a id='line_12282'>  This said, he warns Messapus to the war,</a>
<a id='line_12283'>  Then ev'ry chief exhorts with equal care.</a>
<a id='line_12284'>  All thus encourag'd, his own troops he joins,</a>
<a id='line_12285'>  And hastes to prosecute his deep designs.</a>
<a id='line_12286'></a>
<a id='line_12287'>  Inclos'd with hills, a winding valley lies,</a>
<a id='line_12288'>  By nature form'd for fraud, and fitted for surprise.</a>
<a id='line_12289'>  A narrow track, by human steps untrode,</a>
<a id='line_12290'>  Leads, thro' perplexing thorns, to this obscure abode.</a>
<a id='line_12291'>  High o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands,</a>
<a id='line_12292'>  Whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands.</a>
<a id='line_12293'>  The top is level, an offensive seat</a>
<a id='line_12294'>  Of war; and from the war a safe retreat:</a>
<a id='line_12295'>  For, on the right and left, is room to press</a>
<a id='line_12296'>  The foes at hand, or from afar distress;</a>
<a id='line_12297'>  To drive 'em headlong downward, and to pour</a>
<a id='line_12298'>  On their descending backs a stony show'r.</a>
<a id='line_12299'>  Thither young Turnus took the well-known way,</a>
<a id='line_12300'>  Possess'd the pass, and in blind ambush lay.</a>
<a id='line_12301'></a>
<a id='line_12302'>  Meantime Latonian Phoebe, from the skies,</a>
<a id='line_12303'>  Beheld th' approaching war with hateful eyes,</a>
<a id='line_12304'>  And call'd the light-foot Opis to her aid,</a>
<a id='line_12305'>  Her most belov'd and ever-trusty maid;</a>
<a id='line_12306'>  Then with a sigh began: "Camilla goes</a>
<a id='line_12307'>  To meet her death amidst her fatal foes:</a>
<a id='line_12308'>  The nymphs I lov'd of all my mortal train,</a>
<a id='line_12309'>  Invested with Diana's arms, in vain.</a>
<a id='line_12310'>  Nor is my kindness for the virgin new:</a>
<a id='line_12311'>  'T was born with her; and with her years it grew.</a>
<a id='line_12312'>  Her father Metabus, when forc'd away</a>
<a id='line_12313'>  From old Privernum, for tyrannic sway,</a>
<a id='line_12314'>  Snatch'd up, and sav'd from his prevailing foes,</a>
<a id='line_12315'>  This tender babe, companion of his woes.</a>
<a id='line_12316'>  Casmilla was her mother; but he drown'd</a>
<a id='line_12317'>  One hissing letter in a softer sound,</a>
<a id='line_12318'>  And call'd Camilla. Thro' the woods he flies;</a>
<a id='line_12319'>  Wrapp'd in his robe the royal infant lies.</a>
<a id='line_12320'>  His foes in sight, he mends his weary pace;</a>
<a id='line_12321'>  With shout and clamors they pursue the chase.</a>
<a id='line_12322'>  The banks of Amasene at length he gains:</a>
<a id='line_12323'></a>
<a id='line_12324'>  The raging flood his farther flight restrains,</a>
<a id='line_12325'>  Rais'd o'er the borders with unusual rains.</a>
<a id='line_12326'>  Prepar'd to plunge into the stream, he fears,</a>
<a id='line_12327'>  Not for himself, but for the charge he bears.</a>
<a id='line_12328'>  Anxious, he stops a while, and thinks in haste;</a>
<a id='line_12329'>  Then, desp'rate in distress, resolves at last.</a>
<a id='line_12330'>  A knotty lance of well-boil'd oak he bore;</a>
<a id='line_12331'>  The middle part with cork he cover'd o'er:</a>
<a id='line_12332'>  He clos'd the child within the hollow space;</a>
<a id='line_12333'>  With twigs of bending osier bound the case;</a>
<a id='line_12334'>  Then pois'd the spear, heavy with human weight,</a>
<a id='line_12335'>  And thus invok'd my favor for the freight:</a>
<a id='line_12336'>  'Accept, great goddess of the woods,' he said,</a>
<a id='line_12337'>  'Sent by her sire, this dedicated maid!</a>
<a id='line_12338'>  Thro' air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine;</a>
<a id='line_12339'>  And the first weapons that she knows, are thine.'</a>
<a id='line_12340'>  He said; and with full force the spear he threw:</a>
<a id='line_12341'>  Above the sounding waves Camilla flew.</a>
<a id='line_12342'>  Then, press'd by foes, he stemm'd the stormy tide,</a>
<a id='line_12343'>  And gain'd, by stress of arms, the farther side.</a>
<a id='line_12344'>  His fasten'd spear he pull'd from out the ground,</a>
<a id='line_12345'>  And, victor of his vows, his infant nymph unbound;</a>
<a id='line_12346'>  Nor, after that, in towns which walls inclose,</a>
<a id='line_12347'>  Would trust his hunted life amidst his foes;</a>
<a id='line_12348'>  But, rough, in open air he chose to lie;</a>
<a id='line_12349'>  Earth was his couch, his cov'ring was the sky.</a>
<a id='line_12350'>  On hills unshorn, or in a desart den,</a>
<a id='line_12351'>  He shunn'd the dire society of men.</a>
<a id='line_12352'>  A shepherd's solitary life he led;</a>
<a id='line_12353'>  His daughter with the milk of mares he fed.</a>
<a id='line_12354'>  The dugs of bears, and ev'ry salvage beast,</a>
<a id='line_12355'>  He drew, and thro' her lips the liquor press'd.</a>
<a id='line_12356'>  The little Amazon could scarcely go:</a>
<a id='line_12357'>  He loads her with a quiver and a bow;</a>
<a id='line_12358'>  And, that she might her stagg'ring steps command,</a>
<a id='line_12359'>  He with a slender jav'lin fills her hand.</a>
<a id='line_12360'>  Her flowing hair no golden fillet bound;</a>
<a id='line_12361'>  Nor swept her trailing robe the dusty ground.</a>
<a id='line_12362'>  Instead of these, a tiger's hide o'erspread</a>
<a id='line_12363'>  Her back and shoulders, fasten'd to her head.</a>
<a id='line_12364'>  The flying dart she first attempts to fling,</a>
<a id='line_12365'>  And round her tender temples toss'd the sling;</a>
<a id='line_12366'>  Then, as her strength with years increas'd, began</a>
<a id='line_12367'>  To pierce aloft in air the soaring swan,</a>
<a id='line_12368'>  And from the clouds to fetch the heron and the crane.</a>
<a id='line_12369'>  The Tuscan matrons with each other vied,</a>
<a id='line_12370'>  To bless their rival sons with such a bride;</a>
<a id='line_12371'>  But she disdains their love, to share with me</a>
<a id='line_12372'>  The sylvan shades and vow'd virginity.</a>
<a id='line_12373'>  And, O! I wish, contented with my cares</a>
<a id='line_12374'>  Of salvage spoils, she had not sought the wars!</a>
<a id='line_12375'>  Then had she been of my celestial train,</a>
<a id='line_12376'>  And shunn'd the fate that dooms her to be slain.</a>
<a id='line_12377'>  But since, opposing Heav'n's decree, she goes</a>
<a id='line_12378'>  To find her death among forbidden foes,</a>
<a id='line_12379'>  Haste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight.</a>
<a id='line_12380'>  Where, with the gods, averse, the Latins fight.</a>
<a id='line_12381'>  This bow to thee, this quiver I bequeath,</a>
<a id='line_12382'>  This chosen arrow, to revenge her death:</a>
<a id='line_12383'>  By whate'er hand Camilla shall be slain,</a>
<a id='line_12384'>  Or of the Trojan or Italian train,</a>
<a id='line_12385'>  Let him not pass unpunish'd from the plain.</a>
<a id='line_12386'>  Then, in a hollow cloud, myself will aid</a>
<a id='line_12387'>  To bear the breathless body of my maid:</a>
<a id='line_12388'>  Unspoil'd shall be her arms, and unprofan'd</a>
<a id='line_12389'>  Her holy limbs with any human hand,</a>
<a id='line_12390'>  And in a marble tomb laid in her native land."</a>
<a id='line_12391'></a>
<a id='line_12392'>  She said. The faithful nymph descends from high</a>
<a id='line_12393'>  With rapid flight, and cuts the sounding sky:</a>
<a id='line_12394'>  Black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly.</a>
<a id='line_12395'></a>
<a id='line_12396'>  By this, the Trojan and the Tuscan horse,</a>
<a id='line_12397'>  Drawn up in squadrons, with united force,</a>
<a id='line_12398'>  Approach the walls: the sprightly coursers bound,</a>
<a id='line_12399'>  Press forward on their bits, and shift their ground.</a>
<a id='line_12400'>  Shields, arms, and spears flash horribly from far;</a>
<a id='line_12401'>  And the fields glitter with a waving war.</a>
<a id='line_12402'>  Oppos'd to these, come on with furious force</a>
<a id='line_12403'>  Messapus, Coras, and the Latian horse;</a>
<a id='line_12404'>  These in the body plac'd, on either hand</a>
<a id='line_12405'>  Sustain'd and clos'd by fair Camilla's band.</a>
<a id='line_12406'>  Advancing in a line, they couch their spears;</a>
<a id='line_12407'>  And less and less the middle space appears.</a>
<a id='line_12408'>  Thick smoke obscures the field; and scarce are seen</a>
<a id='line_12409'>  The neighing coursers, and the shouting men.</a>
<a id='line_12410'>  In distance of their darts they stop their course;</a>
<a id='line_12411'>  Then man to man they rush, and horse to horse.</a>
<a id='line_12412'>  The face of heav'n their flying jav'lins hide,</a>
<a id='line_12413'>  And deaths unseen are dealt on either side.</a>
<a id='line_12414'>  Tyrrhenus, and Aconteus, void of fear,</a>
<a id='line_12415'>  By mettled coursers borne in full career,</a>
<a id='line_12416'>  Meet first oppos'd; and, with a mighty shock,</a>
<a id='line_12417'>  Their horses' heads against each other knock.</a>
<a id='line_12418'>  Far from his steed is fierce Aconteus cast,</a>
<a id='line_12419'>  As with an engine's force, or lightning's blast:</a>
<a id='line_12420'>  He rolls along in blood, and breathes his last.</a>
<a id='line_12421'>  The Latin squadrons take a sudden fright,</a>
<a id='line_12422'>  And sling their shields behind, to save their backs in flight</a>
<a id='line_12423'>  Spurring at speed to their own walls they drew;</a>
<a id='line_12424'>  Close in the rear the Tuscan troops pursue,</a>
<a id='line_12425'>  And urge their flight: Asylas leads the chase;</a>
<a id='line_12426'>  Till, seiz'd, with shame, they wheel about and face,</a>
<a id='line_12427'>  Receive their foes, and raise a threat'ning cry.</a>
<a id='line_12428'>  The Tuscans take their turn to fear and fly.</a>
<a id='line_12429'>  So swelling surges, with a thund'ring roar,</a>
<a id='line_12430'>  Driv'n on each other's backs, insult the shore,</a>
<a id='line_12431'>  Bound o'er the rocks, incroach upon the land,</a>
<a id='line_12432'>  And far upon the beach eject the sand;</a>
<a id='line_12433'>  Then backward, with a swing, they take their way,</a>
<a id='line_12434'>  Repuls'd from upper ground, and seek their mother sea;</a>
<a id='line_12435'>  With equal hurry quit th' invaded shore,</a>
<a id='line_12436'>  And swallow back the sand and stones they spew'd before.</a>
<a id='line_12437'></a>
<a id='line_12438'>  Twice were the Tuscans masters of the field,</a>
<a id='line_12439'>  Twice by the Latins, in their turn, repell'd.</a>
<a id='line_12440'>  Asham'd at length, to the third charge they ran;</a>
<a id='line_12441'>  Both hosts resolv'd, and mingled man to man.</a>
<a id='line_12442'>  Now dying groans are heard; the fields are strow'd</a>
<a id='line_12443'>  With falling bodies, and are drunk with blood.</a>
<a id='line_12444'>  Arms, horses, men, on heaps together lie:</a>
<a id='line_12445'>  Confus'd the fight, and more confus'd the cry.</a>
<a id='line_12446'>  Orsilochus, who durst not press too near</a>
<a id='line_12447'>  Strong Remulus, at distance drove his spear,</a>
<a id='line_12448'>  And stuck the steel beneath his horse's ear.</a>
<a id='line_12449'>  The fiery steed, impatient of the wound,</a>
<a id='line_12450'>  Curvets, and, springing upward with a bound,</a>
<a id='line_12451'>  His helpless lord cast backward on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_12452'>  Catillus pierc'd Iolas first; then drew</a>
<a id='line_12453'>  His reeking lance, and at Herminius threw,</a>
<a id='line_12454'>  The mighty champion of the Tuscan crew.</a>
<a id='line_12455'>  His neck and throat unarm'd, his head was bare,</a>
<a id='line_12456'>  But shaded with a length of yellow hair:</a>
<a id='line_12457'>  Secure, he fought, expos'd on ev'ry part,</a>
<a id='line_12458'>  A spacious mark for swords, and for the flying dart.</a>
<a id='line_12459'>  Across the shoulders came the feather'd wound;</a>
<a id='line_12460'>  Transfix'd he fell, and doubled to the ground.</a>
<a id='line_12461'>  The sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed,</a>
<a id='line_12462'>  And death with honor sought on either side.</a>
<a id='line_12463'></a>
<a id='line_12464'>  Resistless thro' the war Camilla rode,</a>
<a id='line_12465'>  In danger unappall'd, and pleas'd with blood.</a>
<a id='line_12466'>  One side was bare for her exerted breast;</a>

<a id='line_12468'>  Now from afar her fatal jav'lins play;</a>
<a id='line_12469'>  Now with her ax's edge she hews her way:</a>
<a id='line_12470'>  Diana's arms upon her shoulder sound;</a>
<a id='line_12471'>  And when, too closely press'd, she quits the ground,</a>
<a id='line_12472'>  From her bent bow she sends a backward wound.</a>
<a id='line_12473'>  Her maids, in martial pomp, on either side,</a>
<a id='line_12474'>  Larina, Tulla, fierce Tarpeia, ride:</a>
<a id='line_12475'>  Italians all; in peace, their queen's delight;</a>
<a id='line_12476'>  In war, the bold companions of the fight.</a>
<a id='line_12477'>  So march'd the Tracian Amazons of old,</a>
<a id='line_12478'>  When Thermodon with bloody billows roll'd:</a>
<a id='line_12479'>  Such troops as these in shining arms were seen,</a>
<a id='line_12480'>  When Theseus met in fight their maiden queen:</a>
<a id='line_12481'>  Such to the field Penthisilea led,</a>
<a id='line_12482'>  From the fierce virgin when the Grecians fled;</a>
<a id='line_12483'>  With such, return'd triumphant from the war,</a>
<a id='line_12484'>  Her maids with cries attend the lofty car;</a>
<a id='line_12485'>  They clash with manly force their moony shields;</a>
<a id='line_12486'>  With female shouts resound the Phrygian fields.</a>
<a id='line_12487'></a>
<a id='line_12488'>  Who foremost, and who last, heroic maid,</a>
<a id='line_12489'>  On the cold earth were by thy courage laid?</a>
<a id='line_12490'>  Thy spear, of mountain ash, Eumenius first,</a>
<a id='line_12491'>  With fury driv'n, from side to side transpierc'd:</a>
<a id='line_12492'>  A purple stream came spouting from the wound;</a>
<a id='line_12493'>  Bath'd in his blood he lies, and bites the ground.</a>
<a id='line_12494'>  Liris and Pegasus at once she slew:</a>
<a id='line_12495'>  The former, as the slacken'd reins he drew</a>
<a id='line_12496'>  Of his faint steed; the latter, as he stretch'd</a>
<a id='line_12497'>  His arm to prop his friend, the jav'lin reach'd.</a>
<a id='line_12498'>  By the same weapon, sent from the same hand,</a>
<a id='line_12499'>  Both fall together, and both spurn the sand.</a>
<a id='line_12500'>  Amastrus next is added to the slain:</a>
<a id='line_12501'>  The rest in rout she follows o'er the plain:</a>
<a id='line_12502'>  Tereus, Harpalycus, Demophoon,</a>
<a id='line_12503'>  And Chromis, at full speed her fury shun.</a>
<a id='line_12504'>  Of all her deadly darts, not one she lost;</a>
<a id='line_12505'>  Each was attended with a Trojan ghost.</a>
<a id='line_12506'>  Young Ornithus bestrode a hunter steed,</a>
<a id='line_12507'>  Swift for the chase, and of Apulian breed.</a>
<a id='line_12508'>  Him from afar she spied, in arms unknown:</a>
<a id='line_12509'>  O'er his broad back an ox's hide was thrown;</a>
<a id='line_12510'>  His helm a wolf, whose gaping jaws were spread</a>
<a id='line_12511'>  A cov'ring for his cheeks, and grinn'd around his head,</a>
<a id='line_12512'>  He clench'd within his hand an iron prong,</a>
<a id='line_12513'>  And tower'd above the rest, conspicuous in the throng.</a>
<a id='line_12514'>  Him soon she singled from the flying train,</a>
<a id='line_12515'>  And slew with ease; then thus insults the slain:</a>
<a id='line_12516'>  "Vain hunter, didst thou think thro' woods to chase</a>
<a id='line_12517'>  The savage herd, a vile and trembling race?</a>
<a id='line_12518'>  Here cease thy vaunts, and own my victory:</a>
<a id='line_12519'>  A woman warrior was too strong for thee.</a>
<a id='line_12520'>  Yet, if the ghosts demand the conqu'ror's name,</a>
<a id='line_12521'>  Confessing great Camilla, save thy shame."</a>
<a id='line_12522'>  Then Butes and Orsilochus she slew,</a>
<a id='line_12523'>  The bulkiest bodies of the Trojan crew;</a>
<a id='line_12524'>  But Butes breast to breast: the spear descends</a>
<a id='line_12525'>  Above the gorget, where his helmet ends,</a>
<a id='line_12526'>  And o'er the shield which his left side defends.</a>
<a id='line_12527'>  Orsilochus and she their courses ply:</a>
<a id='line_12528'>  He seems to follow, and she seems to fly;</a>
<a id='line_12529'>  But in a narrower ring she makes the race;</a>
<a id='line_12530'>  And then he flies, and she pursues the chase.</a>
<a id='line_12531'>  Gath'ring at length on her deluded foe,</a>
<a id='line_12532'>  She swings her ax, and rises to the blow</a>
<a id='line_12533'>  Full on the helm behind, with such a sway</a>
<a id='line_12534'>  The weapon falls, the riven steel gives way:</a>
<a id='line_12535'>  He groans, he roars, he sues in vain for grace;</a>
<a id='line_12536'>  Brains, mingled with his blood, besmear his face.</a>
<a id='line_12537'></a>
<a id='line_12538'>  Astonish'd Aunus just arrives by chance,</a>
<a id='line_12539'>  To see his fall; nor farther dares advance;</a>
<a id='line_12540'>  But, fixing on the horrid maid his eye,</a>
<a id='line_12541'>  He stares, and shakes, and finds it vain to fly;</a>
<a id='line_12542'>  Yet, like a true Ligurian, born to cheat,</a>
<a id='line_12543'>  (At least while fortune favor'd his deceit,)</a>
<a id='line_12544'>  Cries out aloud: "What courage have you shown,</a>
<a id='line_12545'>  Who trust your courser's strength, and not your own?</a>
<a id='line_12546'>  Forego the vantage of your horse, alight,</a>
<a id='line_12547'>  And then on equal terms begin the fight:</a>
<a id='line_12548'>  It shall be seen, weak woman, what you can,</a>
<a id='line_12549'>  When, foot to foot, you combat with a man,"</a>
<a id='line_12550'>  He said. She glows with anger and disdain,</a>
<a id='line_12551'>  Dismounts with speed to dare him on the plain,</a>
<a id='line_12552'>  And leaves her horse at large among her train;</a>
<a id='line_12553'>  With her drawn sword defies him to the field,</a>
<a id='line_12554'>  And, marching, lifts aloft her maiden shield.</a>
<a id='line_12555'>  The youth, who thought his cunning did succeed,</a>
<a id='line_12556'>  Reins round his horse, and urges all his speed;</a>
<a id='line_12557'>  Adds the remembrance of the spur, and hides</a>
<a id='line_12558'>  The goring rowels in his bleeding sides.</a>
<a id='line_12559'>  "Vain fool, and coward!" cries the lofty maid,</a>
<a id='line_12560'>  "Caught in the train which thou thyself hast laid!</a>
<a id='line_12561'>  On others practice thy Ligurian arts;</a>
<a id='line_12562'>  Thin stratagems and tricks of little hearts</a>
<a id='line_12563'>  Are lost on me: nor shalt thou safe retire,</a>
<a id='line_12564'>  With vaunting lies, to thy fallacious sire."</a>
<a id='line_12565'>  At this, so fast her flying feet she sped,</a>
<a id='line_12566'>  That soon she strain'd beyond his horse's head:</a>
<a id='line_12567'>  Then turning short, at once she seiz'd the rein,</a>
<a id='line_12568'>  And laid the boaster grov'ling on the plain.</a>
<a id='line_12569'>  Not with more ease the falcon, from above,</a>
<a id='line_12570'>  Trusses in middle air the trembling dove,</a>
<a id='line_12571'>  Then plumes the prey, in her strong pounces bound:</a>
<a id='line_12572'>  The feathers, foul with blood, come tumbling to the ground.</a>
<a id='line_12573'></a>
<a id='line_12574'>  Now mighty Jove, from his superior height,</a>
<a id='line_12575'>  With his broad eye surveys th' unequal fight.</a>
<a id='line_12576'>  He fires the breast of Tarchon with disdain,</a>

<a id='line_12578'>  Betwixt the broken ranks the Tuscan rides,</a>
<a id='line_12579'>  And these encourages, and those he chides;</a>
<a id='line_12580'>  Recalls each leader, by his name, from flight;</a>
<a id='line_12581'>  Renews their ardor, and restores the fight.</a>
<a id='line_12582'>  "What panic fear has seiz'd your souls? O shame,</a>
<a id='line_12583'>  O brand perpetual of th' Etrurian name!</a>
<a id='line_12584'>  Cowards incurable, a woman's hand</a>
<a id='line_12585'>  Drives, breaks, and scatters your ignoble band!</a>
<a id='line_12586'>  Now cast away the sword, and quit the shield!</a>
<a id='line_12587'>  What use of weapons which you dare not wield?</a>
<a id='line_12588'>  Not thus you fly your female foes by night,</a>

<a id='line_12592'>  These are your studied cares, your lewd delight:</a>
<a id='line_12593'>  Swift to debauch, but slow to manly fight."</a>
<a id='line_12594'>  Thus having said, he spurs amid the foes,</a>
<a id='line_12595'>  Not managing the life he meant to lose.</a>
<a id='line_12596'>  The first he found he seiz'd with headlong haste,</a>
<a id='line_12597'>  In his strong gripe, and clasp'd around the waist;</a>
<a id='line_12598'>  'T was Venulus, whom from his horse he tore,</a>
<a id='line_12599'>  And, laid athwart his own, in triumph bore.</a>
<a id='line_12600'>  Loud shouts ensue; the Latins turn their eyes,</a>
<a id='line_12601'>  And view th' unusual sight with vast surprise.</a>
<a id='line_12602'>  The fiery Tarchon, flying o'er the plains,</a>
<a id='line_12603'>  Press'd in his arms the pond'rous prey sustains;</a>
<a id='line_12604'>  Then, with his shorten'd spear, explores around</a>
<a id='line_12605'>  His jointed arms, to fix a deadly wound.</a>
<a id='line_12606'>  Nor less the captive struggles for his life:</a>
<a id='line_12607'>  He writhes his body to prolong the strife,</a>
<a id='line_12608'>  And, fencing for his naked throat, exerts</a>
<a id='line_12609'>  His utmost vigor, and the point averts.</a>
<a id='line_12610'>  So stoops the yellow eagle from on high,</a>
<a id='line_12611'>  And bears a speckled serpent thro' the sky,</a>
<a id='line_12612'>  Fast'ning his crooked talons on the prey:</a>
<a id='line_12613'>  The pris'ner hisses thro' the liquid way;</a>
<a id='line_12614'>  Resists the royal hawk; and, tho' oppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_12615'>  She fights in volumes, and erects her crest:</a>
<a id='line_12616'>  Turn'd to her foe, she stiffens ev'ry scale,</a>
<a id='line_12617'>  And shoots her forky tongue, and whisks her threat'ning tail.</a>
<a id='line_12618'>  Against the victor, all defense is weak:</a>
<a id='line_12619'>  Th' imperial bird still plies her with his beak;</a>
<a id='line_12620'>  He tears her bowels, and her breast he gores;</a>
<a id='line_12621'>  Then claps his pinions, and securely soars.</a>
<a id='line_12622'>  Thus, thro' the midst of circling enemies,</a>
<a id='line_12623'>  Strong Tarchon snatch'd and bore away his prize.</a>
<a id='line_12624'>  The Tyrrhene troops, that shrunk before, now press</a>
<a id='line_12625'>  The Latins, and presume the like success.</a>
<a id='line_12626'></a>
<a id='line_12627'>  Then Aruns, doom'd to death, his arts assay'd,</a>
<a id='line_12628'>  To murther, unespied, the Volscian maid:</a>
<a id='line_12629'>  This way and that his winding course he bends,</a>

<a id='line_12631'>  When she retires victorious from the chase,</a>
<a id='line_12632'>  He wheels about with care, and shifts his place;</a>
<a id='line_12633'>  When, rushing on, she seeks her foes flight,</a>
<a id='line_12634'>  He keeps aloof, but keeps her still in sight:</a>
<a id='line_12635'>  He threats, and trembles, trying ev'ry way,</a>
<a id='line_12636'>  Unseen to kill, and safely to betray.</a>
<a id='line_12637'>  Chloreus, the priest of Cybele, from far,</a>
<a id='line_12638'>  Glitt'ring in Phrygian arms amidst the war,</a>
<a id='line_12639'>  Was by the virgin view'd. The steed he press'd</a>
<a id='line_12640'>  Was proud with trappings, and his brawny chest</a>
<a id='line_12641'>  With scales of gilded brass was cover'd o'er;</a>
<a id='line_12642'>  A robe of Tyrian dye the rider wore.</a>
<a id='line_12643'>  With deadly wounds he gall'd the distant foe;</a>
<a id='line_12644'>  Gnossian his shafts, and Lycian was his bow:</a>
<a id='line_12645'>  A golden helm his front and head surrounds</a>
<a id='line_12646'>  A gilded quiver from his shoulder sounds.</a>
<a id='line_12647'>  Gold, weav'd with linen, on his thighs he wore,</a>
<a id='line_12648'>  With flowers of needlework distinguish'd o'er,</a>
<a id='line_12649'>  With golden buckles bound, and gather'd up before.</a>
<a id='line_12650'>  Him the fierce maid beheld with ardent eyes,</a>
<a id='line_12651'>  Fond and ambitious of so rich a prize,</a>
<a id='line_12652'>  Or that the temple might his trophies hold,</a>
<a id='line_12653'>  Or else to shine herself in Trojan gold.</a>
<a id='line_12654'>  Blind in her haste, she chases him alone.</a>
<a id='line_12655'>  And seeks his life, regardless of her own.</a>
<a id='line_12656'></a>
<a id='line_12657'>  This lucky moment the sly traitor chose:</a>
<a id='line_12658'>  Then, starting from his ambush, up he rose,</a>
<a id='line_12659'>  And threw, but first to Heav'n address'd his vows:</a>
<a id='line_12660'>  "O patron of Socrates' high abodes,</a>

<a id='line_12668'>  Nor spoils, nor triumph, from the fact I claim,</a>
<a id='line_12669'>  But with my future actions trust my fame.</a>
<a id='line_12670'>  Let me, by stealth, this female plague o'ercome,</a>
<a id='line_12671'>  And from the field return inglorious home."</a>
<a id='line_12672'>  Apollo heard, and, granting half his pray'r,</a>
<a id='line_12673'>  Shuffled in winds the rest, and toss'd in empty air.</a>
<a id='line_12674'>  He gives the death desir'd; his safe return</a>
<a id='line_12675'>  By southern tempests to the seas is borne.</a>
<a id='line_12676'></a>
<a id='line_12677'>  Now, when the jav'lin whizz'd along the skies,</a>

<a id='line_12683'>  Till in her pap the winged weapon stood</a>
<a id='line_12684'>  Infix'd, and deeply drunk the purple blood.</a>
<a id='line_12685'>  Her sad attendants hasten to sustain</a>
<a id='line_12686'>  Their dying lady, drooping on the plain.</a>
<a id='line_12687'>  Far from their sight the trembling Aruns flies,</a>
<a id='line_12688'>  With beating heart, and fear confus'd with joys;</a>
<a id='line_12689'>  Nor dares he farther to pursue his blow,</a>
<a id='line_12690'>  Or ev'n to bear the sight of his expiring foe.</a>
<a id='line_12691'>  As, when the wolf has torn a bullock's hide</a>

<a id='line_12693'>  Conscious of his audacious deed, he flies,</a>
<a id='line_12694'>  And claps his quiv'ring tail between his thighs:</a>
<a id='line_12695'>  So, speeding once, the wretch no more attends,</a>
<a id='line_12696'>  But, spurring forward, herds among his friends.</a>
<a id='line_12697'></a>
<a id='line_12698'>  She wrench'd the jav'lin with her dying hands,</a>
<a id='line_12699'>  But wedg'd within her breast the weapon stands;</a>
<a id='line_12700'>  The wood she draws, the steely point remains;</a>
<a id='line_12701'>  She staggers in her seat with agonizing pains:</a>
<a id='line_12702'>  (A gath'ring mist o'erclouds her cheerful eyes,</a>
<a id='line_12703'>  And from her cheeks the rosy color flies:)</a>
<a id='line_12704'>  Then turns to her, whom of her female train</a>
<a id='line_12705'>  She trusted most, and thus she speaks with pain:</a>
<a id='line_12706'>  "Acca, 't is past! he swims before my sight,</a>

<a id='line_12712'>  She said, and, sliding, sunk upon the plain:</a>
<a id='line_12713'>  Dying, her open'd hand forsakes the rein;</a>
<a id='line_12714'>  Short, and more short, she pants; by slow degrees</a>
<a id='line_12715'>  Her mind the passage from her body frees.</a>
<a id='line_12716'>  She drops her sword; she nods her plumy crest,</a>
<a id='line_12717'>  Her drooping head declining on her breast:</a>
<a id='line_12718'>  In the last sigh her struggling soul expires,</a>
<a id='line_12719'>  And, murm'ring with disdain, to Stygian sounds retires.</a>
<a id='line_12720'></a>
<a id='line_12721'>  A shout, that struck the golden stars, ensued;</a>
<a id='line_12722'>  Despair and rage the languish'd fight renew'd.</a>
<a id='line_12723'>  The Trojan troops and Tuscans, in a line,</a>
<a id='line_12724'>  Advance to charge; the mix'd Arcadians join.</a>
<a id='line_12725'></a>
<a id='line_12726'>  But Cynthia's maid, high seated, from afar</a>

<a id='line_12729'>  Welt'ring in blood, she sees Camilla slain,</a>
<a id='line_12730'>  And, round her corpse, of friends and foes a fighting train.</a>
<a id='line_12731'>  Then, from the bottom of her breast, she drew</a>
<a id='line_12732'>  A mournful sigh, and these sad words ensue:</a>

<a id='line_12743'></a>
<a id='line_12744'>  High o'er the field there stood a hilly mound,</a>
<a id='line_12745'>  Sacred the place, and spread with oaks around,</a>
<a id='line_12746'>  Where, in a marble tomb, Dercennus lay,</a>
<a id='line_12747'>  A king that once in Latium bore the sway.</a>
<a id='line_12748'>  The beauteous Opis thither bent her flight,</a>

<a id='line_12754'>  Charg'd with my message, to Camilla go,</a>
<a id='line_12755'>  And say I sent thee to the shades below,</a>
<a id='line_12756'>  An honor undeserv'd from Cynthia's bow."</a>

<a id='line_12760'>  Then to the stubborn yew her strength applied,</a>

<a id='line_12762'>  The bowstring touch'd her breast, so strong she drew;</a>
<a id='line_12763'>  Whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew.</a>
<a id='line_12764'>  At once the twanging bow and sounding dart</a>

<a id='line_12775'>  Confus'd in flight, they bear each other down,</a>
<a id='line_12776'>  And spur their horses headlong to the town.</a>
<a id='line_12777'>  Driv'n by their foes, and to their fears resign'd,</a>
<a id='line_12778'>  Not once they turn, but take their wounds behind.</a>
<a id='line_12779'>  These drop the shield, and those the lance forego,</a>
<a id='line_12780'>  Or on their shoulders bear the slacken'd bow.</a>
<a id='line_12781'>  The hoofs of horses, with a rattling sound,</a>
<a id='line_12782'>  Beat short and thick, and shake the rotten ground.</a>
<a id='line_12783'>  Black clouds of dust come rolling in the sky,</a>
<a id='line_12784'>  And o'er the darken'd walls and rampires fly.</a>
<a id='line_12785'>  The trembling matrons, from their lofty stands,</a>
<a id='line_12786'>  Rend heav'n with female shrieks, and wring their hands.</a>
<a id='line_12787'>  All pressing on, pursuers and pursued,</a>
<a id='line_12788'>  Are crush'd in crowds, a mingled multitude.</a>
<a id='line_12789'>  Some happy few escape: the throng too late</a>

<a id='line_12791'>  Ev'n in the sight of home, the wretched sire</a>
<a id='line_12792'>  Looks on, and sees his helpless son expire.</a>
<a id='line_12793'>  Then, in a fright, the folding gates they close,</a>
<a id='line_12794'>  But leave their friends excluded with their foes.</a>
<a id='line_12795'>  The vanquish'd cry; the victors loudly shout;</a>
<a id='line_12796'>  'T is terror all within, and slaughter all without.</a>
<a id='line_12797'>  Blind in their fear, they bounce against the wall,</a>
<a id='line_12798'>  Or, to the moats pursued, precipitate their fall.</a>

<a id='line_12812'>  Like a resistless flood, come rolling on:</a>

<a id='line_12814'></a>
<a id='line_12815'>  Inflam'd with rage, (for so the Furies fire</a>

<a id='line_12817'>  He leaves the hilly pass, the woods in vain</a>
<a id='line_12818'>  Possess'd, and downward issues on the plain.</a>
<a id='line_12819'>  Scarce was he gone, when to the straits, now freed</a>
<a id='line_12820'>  From secret foes, the Trojan troops succeed.</a>
<a id='line_12821'>  Thro' the black forest and the ferny brake,</a>
<a id='line_12822'>  Unknowingly secure, their way they take;</a>
<a id='line_12823'>  From the rough mountains to the plain descend,</a>
<a id='line_12824'>  And there, in order drawn, their line extend.</a>
<a id='line_12825'>  Both armies now in open fields are seen;</a>
<a id='line_12826'>  Nor far the distance of the space between.</a>

<a id='line_12828'>  Thro' smoking fields, his hast'ning enemies;</a>
<a id='line_12829'>  And Turnus views the Trojans in array,</a>
<a id='line_12830'>  And hears th' approaching horses proudly neigh.</a>
<a id='line_12831'>  Soon had their hosts in bloody battle join'd;</a>
<a id='line_12832'>  But westward to the sea the sun declin'd.</a>
<a id='line_12833'>  Intrench'd before the town both armies lie,</a>

<a id='line_12841'>  When Turnus saw the Latins leave the field,</a>
<a id='line_12842'>  Their armies broken, and their courage quell'd,</a>
<a id='line_12843'>  Himself become the mark of public spite,</a>
<a id='line_12844'>  His honor question'd for the promis'd fight;</a>
<a id='line_12845'>  The more he was with vulgar hate oppress'd,</a>
<a id='line_12846'>  The more his fury boil'd within his breast:</a>
<a id='line_12847'>  He rous'd his vigor for the last debate,</a>

<a id='line_12849'></a>
<a id='line_12850'>  As, when the swains the Libyan lion chase,</a>
<a id='line_12851'>  He makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace;</a>
<a id='line_12852'>  But, if the pointed jav'lin pierce his side,</a>
<a id='line_12853'>  The lordly beast returns with double pride:</a>
<a id='line_12854'>  He wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain;</a>

<a id='line_12856'>  So Turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire,</a>
<a id='line_12857'>  Thro' his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire.</a>
<a id='line_12858'></a>
<a id='line_12859'>  Trembling with rage, around the court he ran,</a>
<a id='line_12860'>  At length approach'd the king, and thus began:</a>

<a id='line_12863'>  This base deserter of his native land.</a>
<a id='line_12864'>  The Trojan, by his word, is bound to take</a>

<a id='line_12868'>  The Latians unconcern'd shall see the fight;</a>
<a id='line_12869'>  This arm unaided shall assert your right:</a>

<a id='line_12871'>  To him the crown and beauteous bride remain."</a>
<a id='line_12872'></a>
<a id='line_12873'>  To whom the king sedately thus replied:</a>
<a id='line_12874'>  "Brave youth, the more your valor has been tried,</a>
<a id='line_12875'>  The more becomes it us, with due respect,</a>

<a id='line_12877'>  You want not wealth, or a successive throne,</a>
<a id='line_12878'>  Or cities which your arms have made your own:</a>
<a id='line_12879'>  My towns and treasures are at your command,</a>
<a id='line_12880'>  And stor'd with blooming beauties is my land;</a>
<a id='line_12881'>  Laurentum more than one Lavinia sees,</a>
<a id='line_12882'>  Unmarried, fair, of noble families.</a>
<a id='line_12883'>  Now let me speak, and you with patience hear,</a>
<a id='line_12884'>  Things which perhaps may grate a lover's ear,</a>
<a id='line_12885'>  But sound advice, proceeding from a heart</a>
<a id='line_12886'>  Sincerely yours, and free from fraudful art.</a>
<a id='line_12887'>  The gods, by signs, have manifestly shown,</a>
<a id='line_12888'>  No prince Italian born should heir my throne:</a>
<a id='line_12889'>  Oft have our augurs, in prediction skill'd,</a>
<a id='line_12890'>  And oft our priests, foreign son reveal'd.</a>
<a id='line_12891'>  Yet, won by worth that cannot be withstood,</a>
<a id='line_12892'>  Brib'd by my kindness to my kindred blood,</a>
<a id='line_12893'>  Urg'd by my wife, who would not be denied,</a>
<a id='line_12894'>  I promis'd my Lavinia for your bride:</a>
<a id='line_12895'>  Her from her plighted lord by force I took;</a>
<a id='line_12896'>  All ties of treaties, and of honor, broke:</a>
<a id='line_12897'>  On your account I wag'd an impious war-</a>
<a id='line_12898'>  With what success, 't is needless to declare;</a>
<a id='line_12899'>  I and my subjects feel, and you have had your share.</a>
<a id='line_12900'>  Twice vanquish'd while in bloody fields we strive,</a>
<a id='line_12901'>  Scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive:</a>
<a id='line_12902'>  The rolling flood runs warm with human gore;</a>
<a id='line_12903'>  The bones of Latians blanch the neighb'ring shore.</a>
<a id='line_12904'>  Why put I not an end to this debate,</a>
<a id='line_12905'>  Still unresolv'd, and still a slave to fate?</a>
<a id='line_12906'>  If Turnus' death a lasting peace can give,</a>
<a id='line_12907'>  Why should I not procure it whilst you live?</a>
<a id='line_12908'>  Should I to doubtful arms your youth betray,</a>
<a id='line_12909'>  What would my kinsmen the Rutulians say?</a>
<a id='line_12910'>  And, should you fall in fight, (which Heav'n defend!)</a>
<a id='line_12911'>  How curse the cause which hasten'd to his end</a>
<a id='line_12912'>  The daughter's lover and the father's friend?</a>
<a id='line_12913'>  Weigh in your mind the various chance of war;</a>
<a id='line_12914'>  Pity your parent's age, and ease his care."</a>
<a id='line_12915'></a>
<a id='line_12916'>  Such balmy words he pour'd, but all in vain:</a>
<a id='line_12917'>  The proffer'd med'cine but provok'd the pain.</a>
<a id='line_12918'>  The wrathful youth, disdaining the relief,</a>
<a id='line_12919'>  With intermitting sobs thus vents his grief:</a>
<a id='line_12920'>  "The care, O best of fathers, which you take</a>
<a id='line_12921'>  For my concerns, at my desire forsake.</a>
<a id='line_12922'>  Permit me not to languish out my days,</a>
<a id='line_12923'>  But make the best exchange of life for praise.</a>
<a id='line_12924'>  This arm, this lance, can well dispute the prize;</a>
<a id='line_12925'>  And the blood follows, where the weapon flies.</a>
<a id='line_12926'>  His goddess mother is not near, to shroud</a>
<a id='line_12927'>  The flying coward with an empty cloud."</a>
<a id='line_12928'></a>
<a id='line_12929'>  But now the queen, who fear'd for Turnus' life,</a>
<a id='line_12930'>  And loath'd the hard conditions of the strife,</a>
<a id='line_12931'>  Held him by force; and, dying in his death,</a>
<a id='line_12932'>  In these sad accents gave her sorrow breath:</a>
<a id='line_12933'>  "O Turnus, I adjure thee by these tears,</a>
<a id='line_12934'>  And whate'er price Amata's honor bears</a>
<a id='line_12935'>  Within thy breast, since thou art all my hope,</a>
<a id='line_12936'>  My sickly mind's repose, my sinking age's prop;</a>
<a id='line_12937'>  Since on the safety of thy life alone</a>
<a id='line_12938'>  Depends Latinus, and the Latian throne:</a>
<a id='line_12939'>  Refuse me not this one, this only pray'r,</a>
<a id='line_12940'>  To waive the combat, and pursue the war.</a>
<a id='line_12941'>  Whatever chance attends this fatal strife,</a>
<a id='line_12942'>  Think it includes, in thine, Amata's life.</a>
<a id='line_12943'>  I cannot live a slave, or see my throne</a>
<a id='line_12944'>  Usurp'd by strangers or a Trojan son."</a>
<a id='line_12945'></a>
<a id='line_12946'>  At this, a flood of tears Lavinia shed;</a>
<a id='line_12947'>  A crimson blush her beauteous face o'erspread,</a>
<a id='line_12948'>  Varying her cheeks by turns with white and red.</a>
<a id='line_12949'>  The driving colors, never at a stay,</a>
<a id='line_12950'>  Run here and there, and flush, and fade away.</a>
<a id='line_12951'>  Delightful change! Thus Indian iv'ry shows,</a>
<a id='line_12952'>  Which with the bord'ring paint of purple glows;</a>
<a id='line_12953'>  Or lilies damask'd by the neighb'ring rose.</a>
<a id='line_12954'></a>
<a id='line_12955'>  The lover gaz'd, and, burning with desire,</a>
<a id='line_12956'>  The more he look'd, the more he fed the fire:</a>
<a id='line_12957'>  Revenge, and jealous rage, and secret spite,</a>
<a id='line_12958'>  Roll in his breast, and rouse him to the fight.</a>
<a id='line_12959'>  Then fixing on the queen his ardent eyes,</a>
<a id='line_12960'>  Firm to his first intent, he thus replies:</a>
<a id='line_12961'>  "O mother, do not by your tears prepare</a>
<a id='line_12962'>  Such boding omens, and prejudge the war.</a>
<a id='line_12963'>  Resolv'd on fight, I am no longer free</a>
<a id='line_12964'>  To shun my death, if Heav'n my death decree."</a>
<a id='line_12965'>  Then turning to the herald, thus pursues:</a>
<a id='line_12966'>  "Go, greet the Trojan with ungrateful news;</a>
<a id='line_12967'>  Denounce from me, that, when to-morrow's light</a>
<a id='line_12968'>  Shall gild the heav'ns, he need not urge the fight;</a>
<a id='line_12969'>  The Trojan and Rutulian troops no more</a>
<a id='line_12970'>  Shall dye, with mutual blood, the Latian shore:</a>
<a id='line_12971'>  Our single swords the quarrel shall decide,</a>
<a id='line_12972'>  And to the victor be the beauteous bride."</a>
<a id='line_12973'></a>
<a id='line_12974'>  He said, and striding on, with speedy pace,</a>
<a id='line_12975'>  He sought his coursers of the Thracian race.</a>
<a id='line_12976'>  At his approach they toss their heads on high,</a>
<a id='line_12977'>  And, proudly neighing, promise victory.</a>
<a id='line_12978'>  The sires of these Orythia sent from far,</a>
<a id='line_12979'>  To grace Pilumnus, when he went to war.</a>
<a id='line_12980'>  The drifts of Thracian snows were scarce so white,</a>
<a id='line_12981'>  Nor northern winds in fleetness match'd their flight.</a>
<a id='line_12982'>  Officious grooms stand ready by his side;</a>
<a id='line_12983'>  And some with combs their flowing manes divide,</a>
<a id='line_12984'>  And others stroke their chests and gently soothe their pride.</a>
<a id='line_12985'></a>
<a id='line_12986'>  He sheath'd his limbs in arms; a temper'd mass</a>
<a id='line_12987'>  Of golden metal those, and mountain brass.</a>
<a id='line_12988'>  Then to his head his glitt'ring helm he tied,</a>
<a id='line_12989'>  And girt his faithful fauchion to his side.</a>
<a id='line_12990'>  In his Aetnaean forge, the God of Fire</a>
<a id='line_12991'>  That fauchion labor'd for the hero's sire;</a>
<a id='line_12992'>  Immortal keenness on the blade bestow'd,</a>
<a id='line_12993'>  And plung'd it hissing in the Stygian flood.</a>
<a id='line_12994'>  Propp'd on a pillar, which the ceiling bore,</a>
<a id='line_12995'>  Was plac'd the lance Auruncan Actor wore;</a>
<a id='line_12996'>  Which with such force he brandish'd in his hand,</a>
<a id='line_12997'>  The tough ash trembled like an osier wand:</a>
<a id='line_12998'>  Then cried: "O pond'rous spoil of Actor slain,</a>
<a id='line_12999'>  And never yet by Turnus toss'd in vain,</a>
<a id='line_13000'>  Fail not this day thy wonted force; but go,</a>
<a id='line_13001'>  Sent by this hand, to pierce the Trojan foe!</a>
<a id='line_13002'>  Give me to tear his corslet from his breast,</a>
<a id='line_13003'>  And from that eunuch head to rend the crest;</a>
<a id='line_13004'>  Dragg'd in the dust, his frizzled hair to soil,</a>
<a id='line_13005'>  Hot from the vexing ir'n, and smear'd with fragrant oil!"</a>
<a id='line_13006'></a>
<a id='line_13007'>  Thus while he raves, from his wide nostrils flies</a>
<a id='line_13008'>  A fiery steam, and sparkles from his eyes.</a>
<a id='line_13009'>  So fares the bull in his lov'd female's sight:</a>
<a id='line_13010'>  Proudly he bellows, and preludes the fight;</a>
<a id='line_13011'>  He tries his goring horns against a tree,</a>
<a id='line_13012'>  And meditates his absent enemy;</a>
<a id='line_13013'>  He pushes at the winds; he digs the strand</a>
<a id='line_13014'>  With his black hoofs, and spurns the yellow sand.</a>
<a id='line_13015'></a>
<a id='line_13016'>  Nor less the Trojan, in his Lemnian arms,</a>
<a id='line_13017'>  To future fight his manly courage warms:</a>
<a id='line_13018'>  He whets his fury, and with joy prepares</a>
<a id='line_13019'>  To terminate at once the ling'ring wars;</a>
<a id='line_13020'>  To cheer his chiefs and tender son, relates</a>
<a id='line_13021'>  What Heav'n had promis'd, and expounds the fates.</a>
<a id='line_13022'>  Then to the Latian king he sends, to cease</a>
<a id='line_13023'>  The rage of arms, and ratify the peace.</a>
<a id='line_13024'></a>
<a id='line_13025'>  The morn ensuing, from the mountain's height,</a>
<a id='line_13026'>  Had scarcely spread the skies with rosy light;</a>
<a id='line_13027'>  Th' ethereal coursers, bounding from the sea,</a>
<a id='line_13028'>  From out their flaming nostrils breath'd the day;</a>
<a id='line_13029'>  When now the Trojan and Rutulian guard,</a>
<a id='line_13030'>  In friendly labor join'd, the list prepar'd.</a>
<a id='line_13031'>  Beneath the walls they measure out the space;</a>
<a id='line_13032'>  Then sacred altars rear, on sods of grass,</a>
<a id='line_13033'>  Where, with religious their common gods they place.</a>
<a id='line_13034'>  In purest white the priests their heads attire;</a>
<a id='line_13035'>  And living waters bear, and holy fire;</a>
<a id='line_13036'>  And, o'er their linen hoods and shaded hair,</a>
<a id='line_13037'>  Long twisted wreaths of sacred veryain wear.</a>
<a id='line_13038'></a>
<a id='line_13039'>  In order issuing from the town appears</a>
<a id='line_13040'>  The Latin legion, arm'd with pointed spears;</a>
<a id='line_13041'>  And from the fields, advancing on a line,</a>
<a id='line_13042'>  The Trojan and the Tuscan forces join:</a>
<a id='line_13043'>  Their various arms afford a pleasing sight;</a>
<a id='line_13044'>  A peaceful train they seem, in peace prepar'd for fight.</a>
<a id='line_13045'>  Betwixt the ranks the proud commanders ride,</a>
<a id='line_13046'>  Glitt'ring with gold, and vests in purple dyed;</a>
<a id='line_13047'>  Here Mnestheus, author of the Memmian line,</a>

<a id='line_13051'>  Reclining on their ample shields, they stand,</a>
<a id='line_13052'>  And fix their pointed lances in the sand.</a>
<a id='line_13053'>  Now, studious of the sight, a num'rous throng</a>
<a id='line_13054'>  Of either sex promiscuous, old and young,</a>
<a id='line_13055'>  Swarm the town: by those who rest behind,</a>
<a id='line_13056'>  The gates and walls and houses' tops are lin'd.</a>
<a id='line_13057'>  Meantime the Queen of Heav'n beheld the sight,</a>
<a id='line_13058'>  With eyes unpleas'd, from Mount Albano's height</a>
<a id='line_13059'>  (Since call'd Albano by succeeding fame,</a>

<a id='line_13088'></a>
<a id='line_13089'>  At this the lovely nymph, with grief oppress'd,</a>

<a id='line_13097'>  She said, and, sailing on the winged wind,</a>
<a id='line_13098'>  Left the sad nymph suspended in her mind.</a>
<a id='line_13099'></a>
<a id='line_13100'>  And now pomp the peaceful kings appear:</a>

<a id='line_13104'>  Two snowy coursers Turnus' chariot yoke,</a>
<a id='line_13105'>  And in his hand two massy spears he shook:</a>

<a id='line_13107'>  Aeneas, author of the Roman line;</a>

<a id='line_13112'>  A porket, and a lamb that never suffer'd shears.</a>
<a id='line_13113'>  Then to the rising sun he turns his eyes,</a>

<a id='line_13119'></a>
<a id='line_13120'>  Aeneas then unsheath'd his shining sword,</a>
<a id='line_13121'>  And thus with pious pray'rs the gods ador'd:</a>

<a id='line_13173'></a>
<a id='line_13174'>  When thus in public view the peace was tied</a>

<a id='line_13184'>  Then, gath'ring sound, they murmur more aloud.</a>
<a id='line_13185'>  Now, side to side, they measure with their eyes</a>

<a id='line_13189'>  Turnus himself appears in public sight</a>
<a id='line_13190'>  Conscious of fate, desponding of the fight.</a>
<a id='line_13191'>  Slowly he moves, and at his altar stands</a>
<a id='line_13192'>  With eyes dejected, and with trembling hands;</a>
<a id='line_13193'>  And, while he mutters undistinguish'd pray'rs,</a>
<a id='line_13194'>  A livid deadness in his cheeks appears.</a>

<a id='line_13199'>  And found their ready minds for change prepar'd;</a>
<a id='line_13200'>  Dissembling her immortal form, she took</a>
<a id='line_13201'>  Camertus' mien, his habit, and his look;</a>
<a id='line_13202'>  A chief of ancient blood; in arms well known</a>
<a id='line_13203'>  Was his great sire, and he his greater son.</a>
<a id='line_13204'>  His shape assum'd, amid the ranks she ran,</a>
<a id='line_13205'>  And humoring their first motions, thus began:</a>
<a id='line_13206'>  "For shame, Rutulians, can you bear the sight</a>

<a id='line_13218'>  But you, a servile and inglorious band,</a>
<a id='line_13219'>  For foreign lords shall sow your native land,</a>
<a id='line_13220'>  Those fruitful fields your fighting fathers gain'd,</a>
<a id='line_13221'>  Which have so long their lazy sons sustain'd."</a>
<a id='line_13222'>  With words like these, she carried her design:</a>
<a id='line_13223'>  A rising murmur runs along the line.</a>
<a id='line_13224'>  Then ev'n the city troops, and Latians, tir'd</a>
<a id='line_13225'>  With tedious war, seem with new souls inspir'd:</a>
<a id='line_13226'>  Their champion's fate with pity they lament,</a>
<a id='line_13227'>  And of the league, so lately sworn, repent.</a>
<a id='line_13228'></a>
<a id='line_13229'>  Nor fails the goddess to foment the rage</a>
<a id='line_13230'>  With lying wonders, and a false presage;</a>
<a id='line_13231'>  But adds a sign, which, present to their eyes,</a>
<a id='line_13232'>  Inspires new courage, and a glad surprise.</a>
<a id='line_13233'>  For, sudden, in the fiery tracts above,</a>
<a id='line_13234'>  Appears in pomp th' imperial bird of Jove:</a>
<a id='line_13235'>  A plump of fowl he spies, that swim the lakes,</a>
<a id='line_13236'>  And o'er their heads his sounding pinions shakes;</a>
<a id='line_13237'>  Then, stooping on the fairest of the train,</a>
<a id='line_13238'>  In his strong talons truss'd a silver swan.</a>
<a id='line_13239'>  Th' Italians wonder at th' unusual sight;</a>
<a id='line_13240'>  But, while he lags, and labors in his flight,</a>
<a id='line_13241'>  Behold, the dastard fowl return anew,</a>
<a id='line_13242'>  And with united force the foe pursue:</a>
<a id='line_13243'>  Clam'rous around the royal hawk they fly,</a>
<a id='line_13244'>  And, thick'ning in a cloud, o'ershade the sky.</a>
<a id='line_13245'>  They cuff, they scratch, they cross his airy course;</a>
<a id='line_13246'>  Nor can th' incumber'd bird sustain their force;</a>
<a id='line_13247'>  But vex'd, not vanquish'd, drops the pond'rous prey,</a>
<a id='line_13248'>  And, lighten'd of his burthen, wings his way.</a>
<a id='line_13249'></a>
<a id='line_13250'>  Th' Ausonian bands with shouts salute the sight,</a>
<a id='line_13251'>  Eager of action, and demand the fight.</a>
<a id='line_13252'>  Then King Tolumnius, vers'd in augurs' arts,</a>
<a id='line_13253'>  Cries out, and thus his boasted skill imparts:</a>
<a id='line_13254'>  "At length 't is granted, what I long desir'd!</a>
<a id='line_13255'>  This, this is what my frequent vows requir'd.</a>
<a id='line_13256'>  Ye gods, I take your omen, and obey.</a>
<a id='line_13257'>  Advance, my friends, and charge! I lead the way.</a>
<a id='line_13258'>  These are the foreign foes, whose impious band,</a>
<a id='line_13259'>  Like that rapacious bird, infest our land:</a>
<a id='line_13260'>  But soon, like him, they shall be forc'd to sea</a>

<a id='line_13262'>  Your timely succor to your country bring,</a>
<a id='line_13263'>  Haste to the rescue, and redeem your king."</a>
<a id='line_13264'></a>
<a id='line_13265'>  He said; and, pressing onward thro' the crew,</a>
<a id='line_13266'>  Pois'd in his lifted arm, his lance he threw.</a>
<a id='line_13267'>  The winged weapon, whistling in the wind,</a>
<a id='line_13268'>  Came driving on, nor miss'd the mark design'd.</a>
<a id='line_13269'>  At once the cornel rattled in the skies;</a>
<a id='line_13270'>  At once tumultuous shouts and clamors rise.</a>
<a id='line_13271'>  Nine brothers in a goodly band there stood,</a>
<a id='line_13272'>  Born of Arcadian mix'd with Tuscan blood,</a>
<a id='line_13273'>  Gylippus' sons: the fatal jav'lin flew,</a>
<a id='line_13274'>  Aim'd at the midmost of the friendly crew.</a>
<a id='line_13275'>  A passage thro' the jointed arms it found,</a>
<a id='line_13276'>  Just where the belt was to the body bound,</a>
<a id='line_13277'>  And struck the gentle youth extended on the ground.</a>
<a id='line_13278'>  Then, fir'd with pious rage, the gen'rous train</a>
<a id='line_13279'>  Run madly forward to revenge the slain.</a>
<a id='line_13280'>  And some with eager haste their jav'lins throw;</a>
<a id='line_13281'>  And some with sword in hand assault the foe.</a>
<a id='line_13282'></a>
<a id='line_13283'>  The wish'd insult the Latine troops embrace,</a>
<a id='line_13284'>  And meet their ardor in the middle space.</a>
<a id='line_13285'>  The Trojans, Tuscans, and Arcadian line,</a>
<a id='line_13286'>  With equal courage obviate their design.</a>
<a id='line_13287'>  Peace leaves the violated fields, and hate</a>
<a id='line_13288'>  Both armies urges to their mutual fate.</a>
<a id='line_13289'>  With impious haste their altars are o'erturn'd,</a>
<a id='line_13290'>  The sacrifice half-broil'd, and half-unburn'd.</a>
<a id='line_13291'>  Thick storms of steel from either army fly,</a>
<a id='line_13292'>  And clouds of clashing darts obscure the sky;</a>
<a id='line_13293'>  Brands from the fire are missive weapons made,</a>
<a id='line_13294'>  With chargers, bowls, and all the priestly trade.</a>
<a id='line_13295'>  Latinus, frighted, hastens from the fray,</a>
<a id='line_13296'>  And bears his unregarded gods away.</a>
<a id='line_13297'>  These on their horses vault; those yoke the car;</a>
<a id='line_13298'>  The rest, with swords on high, run headlong to the war.</a>
<a id='line_13299'></a>
<a id='line_13300'>  Messapus, eager to confound the peace,</a>
<a id='line_13301'>  Spurr'd his hot courser thro' the fighting prease,</a>
<a id='line_13302'>  At King Aulestes, by his purple known</a>
<a id='line_13303'>  A Tuscan prince, and by his regal crown;</a>
<a id='line_13304'>  And, with a shock encount'ring, bore him down.</a>
<a id='line_13305'>  Backward he fell; and, as his fate design'd,</a>
<a id='line_13306'>  The ruins of an altar were behind:</a>
<a id='line_13307'>  There, pitching on his shoulders and his head,</a>
<a id='line_13308'>  Amid the scatt'ring fires he lay supinely spread.</a>
<a id='line_13309'>  The beamy spear, descending from above,</a>
<a id='line_13310'>  His cuirass pierc'd, and thro' his body drove.</a>
<a id='line_13311'>  Then, with a scornful smile, the victor cries:</a>
<a id='line_13312'>  "The gods have found a fitter sacrifice."</a>
<a id='line_13313'>  Greedy of spoils, th' Italians strip the dead</a>
<a id='line_13314'>  Of his rich armor, and uncrown his head.</a>
<a id='line_13315'></a>
<a id='line_13316'>  Priest Corynaeus, arm'd his better hand,</a>
<a id='line_13317'>  From his own altar, with a blazing brand;</a>
<a id='line_13318'>  And, as Ebusus with a thund'ring pace</a>
<a id='line_13319'>  Advanc'd to battle, dash'd it on his face:</a>
<a id='line_13320'>  His bristly beard shines out with sudden fires;</a>
<a id='line_13321'>  The crackling crop a noisome scent expires.</a>
<a id='line_13322'>  Following the blow, he seiz'd his curling crown</a>
<a id='line_13323'>  With his left hand; his other cast him down.</a>
<a id='line_13324'>  The prostrate body with his knees he press'd,</a>
<a id='line_13325'>  And plung'd his holy poniard in his breast.</a>
<a id='line_13326'></a>
<a id='line_13327'>  While Podalirius, with his sword, pursued</a>
<a id='line_13328'>  The shepherd Alsus thro' the flying crowd,</a>
<a id='line_13329'>  Swiftly he turns, and aims a deadly blow</a>
<a id='line_13330'>  Full on the front of his unwary foe.</a>
<a id='line_13331'>  The broad ax enters with a crashing sound,</a>
<a id='line_13332'>  And cleaves the chin with one continued wound;</a>
<a id='line_13333'>  Warm blood, and mingled brains, besmear his arms around</a>
<a id='line_13334'>  An iron sleep his stupid eyes oppress'd,</a>

<a id='line_13336'></a>
<a id='line_13337'>  But good Aeneas rush'd amid the bands;</a>
<a id='line_13338'>  Bare was his head, and naked were his hands,</a>
<a id='line_13339'>  In sign of truce: then thus he cries aloud:</a>
<a id='line_13340'>  "What sudden rage, what new desire of blood,</a>
<a id='line_13341'>  Inflames your alter'd minds? O Trojans, cease</a>

<a id='line_13343'>  By human sanctions, and by laws divine,</a>
<a id='line_13344'>  The terms are all agreed; the war is mine.</a>
<a id='line_13345'>  Dismiss your fears, and let the fight ensue;</a>
<a id='line_13346'>  This hand alone shall right the gods and you:</a>

<a id='line_13349'></a>
<a id='line_13350'>  Thus while he spoke, unmindful of defense,</a>

<a id='line_13427'>  The coursers frighted, and their course controll'd.</a>
<a id='line_13428'>  The lance of Turnus reach'd him as he hung,</a>
<a id='line_13429'>  And pierc'd his plated arms, but pass'd along,</a>
<a id='line_13430'>  And only raz'd the skin. He turn'd, and held</a>
<a id='line_13431'>  Against his threat'ning foe his ample shield;</a>
<a id='line_13432'>  Then call'd for aid: but, while he cried in vain,</a>

<a id='line_13472'>  Then to the patron of his art he pray'd:</a>
<a id='line_13473'>  The patron of his art refus'd his aid.</a>
<a id='line_13474'></a>

<a id='line_13946'>  With horns adverse they meet; the keeper flies;</a>
<a id='line_13947'>  Mute stands the herd; the heifers roll their eyes,</a>
<a id='line_13948'>  And wait th' event; which victor they shall bear,</a>
<a id='line_13949'>  And who shall be the lord, to rule the lusty year:</a>
<a id='line_13950'>  With rage of love the jealous rivals burn,</a>
<a id='line_13951'>  And push for push, and wound for wound return;</a>
<a id='line_13952'>  Their dewlaps gor'd, their sides are lav'd in blood;</a>
<a id='line_13953'>  Loud cries and roaring sounds rebellow thro' the wood:</a>
<a id='line_13954'>  Such was the combat in the listed ground;</a>
<a id='line_13955'>  So clash their swords, and so their shields resound.</a>
<a id='line_13956'></a>
<a id='line_13957'>  Jove sets the beam; in either scale he lays</a>
<a id='line_13958'>  The champions' fate, and each exactly weighs.</a>
<a id='line_13959'>  On this side, life and lucky chance ascends;</a>
<a id='line_13960'>  Loaded with death, that other scale descends.</a>
<a id='line_13961'>  Rais'd on the stretch, young Turnus aims a blow</a>
<a id='line_13962'>  Full on the helm of his unguarded foe:</a>
<a id='line_13963'>  Shrill shouts and clamors ring on either side,</a>
<a id='line_13964'>  As hopes and fears their panting hearts divide.</a>
<a id='line_13965'>  But all in pieces flies the traitor sword,</a>
<a id='line_13966'>  And, in the middle stroke, deserts his lord.</a>
<a id='line_13967'>  Now is but death, or flight; disarm'd he flies,</a>
<a id='line_13968'>  When in his hand an unknown hilt he spies.</a>
<a id='line_13969'>  Fame says that Turnus, when his steeds he join'd,</a>
<a id='line_13970'>  Hurrying to war, disorder'd in his mind,</a>
<a id='line_13971'>  Snatch'd the first weapon which his haste could find.</a>
<a id='line_13972'>  'T was not the fated sword his father bore,</a>
<a id='line_13973'>  But that his charioteer Metiscus wore.</a>
<a id='line_13974'>  This, while the Trojans fled, the toughness held;</a>
<a id='line_13975'>  But, vain against the great Vulcanian shield,</a>
<a id='line_13976'>  The mortal-temper'd steel deceiv'd his hand:</a>
<a id='line_13977'>  The shiver'd fragments shone amid the sand.</a>
<a id='line_13978'></a>
<a id='line_13979'>  Surpris'd with fear, he fled along the field,</a>
<a id='line_13980'>  And now forthright, and now in orbits wheel'd;</a>
<a id='line_13981'>  For here the Trojan troops the list surround,</a>
<a id='line_13982'>  And there the pass is clos'd with pools and marshy ground.</a>
<a id='line_13983'>  Aeneas hastens, tho' with heavier pace-</a>
<a id='line_13984'>  His wound, so newly knit, retards the chase,</a>
<a id='line_13985'>  And oft his trembling knees their aid refuse-</a>
<a id='line_13986'>  Yet, pressing foot by foot, his foe pursues.</a>
<a id='line_13987'></a>
<a id='line_13988'>  Thus, when a fearful stag is clos'd around</a>
<a id='line_13989'>  With crimson toils, or in a river found,</a>
<a id='line_13990'>  High on the bank the deep-mouth'd hound appears,</a>
<a id='line_13991'>  Still opening, following still, where'er he steers;</a>
<a id='line_13992'>  The persecuted creature, to and fro,</a>
<a id='line_13993'>  Turns here and there, to scape his Umbrian foe:</a>
<a id='line_13994'>  Steep is th' ascent, and, if he gains the land,</a>
<a id='line_13995'>  The purple death is pitch'd along the strand.</a>
<a id='line_13996'>  His eager foe, determin'd to the chase,</a>
<a id='line_13997'>  Stretch'd at his length, gains ground at ev'ry pace;</a>
<a id='line_13998'>  Now to his beamy head he makes his way,</a>
<a id='line_13999'>  And now he holds, or thinks he holds, his prey:</a>
<a id='line_14000'>  Just at the pinch, the stag springs out with fear;</a>
<a id='line_14001'>  He bites the wind, and fills his sounding jaws with air:</a>
<a id='line_14002'>  The rocks, the lakes, the meadows ring with cries;</a>
<a id='line_14003'>  The mortal tumult mounts, and thunders in the skies.</a>
<a id='line_14004'>  Thus flies the Daunian prince, and, flying, blames</a>
<a id='line_14005'>  His tardy troops, and, calling by their names,</a>
<a id='line_14006'>  Demands his trusty sword. The Trojan threats</a>
<a id='line_14007'>  The realm with ruin, and their ancient seats</a>
<a id='line_14008'>  To lay in ashes, if they dare supply</a>
<a id='line_14009'>  With arms or aid his vanquish'd enemy:</a>
<a id='line_14010'>  Thus menacing, he still pursues the course,</a>
<a id='line_14011'>  With vigor, tho' diminish'd of his force.</a>
<a id='line_14012'>  Ten times already round the listed place</a>
<a id='line_14013'>  One chief had fled, and t' other giv'n the chase:</a>
<a id='line_14014'>  No trivial prize is play'd; for on the life</a>
<a id='line_14015'>  Or death of Turnus now depends the strife.</a>
<a id='line_14016'></a>
<a id='line_14017'>  Within the space, an olive tree had stood,</a>
<a id='line_14018'>  A sacred shade, a venerable wood,</a>
<a id='line_14019'>  For vows to Faunus paid, the Latins' guardian god.</a>
<a id='line_14020'>  Here hung the vests, and tablets were ingrav'd,</a>
<a id='line_14021'>  Of sinking mariners from shipwrack sav'd.</a>
<a id='line_14022'>  With heedless hands the Trojans fell'd the tree,</a>
<a id='line_14023'>  To make the ground inclos'd for combat free.</a>
<a id='line_14024'>  Deep in the root, whether by fate, or chance,</a>
<a id='line_14025'>  Or erring haste, the Trojan drove his lance;</a>
<a id='line_14026'>  Then stoop'd, and tugg'd with force immense, to free</a>
<a id='line_14027'>  Th' incumber'd spear from the tenacious tree;</a>
<a id='line_14028'>  That, whom his fainting limbs pursued in vain,</a>
<a id='line_14029'>  His flying weapon might from far attain.</a>
<a id='line_14030'></a>
<a id='line_14031'>  Confus'd with fear, bereft of human aid,</a>
<a id='line_14032'>  Then Turnus to the gods, and first to Faunus pray'd:</a>
<a id='line_14033'>  "O Faunus, pity! and thou Mother Earth,</a>
<a id='line_14034'>  Where I thy foster son receiv'd my birth,</a>
<a id='line_14035'>  Hold fast the steel! If my religious hand</a>
<a id='line_14036'>  Your plant has honor'd, which your foes profan'd,</a>
<a id='line_14037'>  Propitious hear my pious pray'r!" He said,</a>
<a id='line_14038'>  Nor with successless vows invok'd their aid.</a>
<a id='line_14039'>  Th' incumbent hero wrench'd, and pull'd, and strain'd;</a>
<a id='line_14040'>  But still the stubborn earth the steel detain'd.</a>
<a id='line_14041'>  Juturna took her time; and, while in vain</a>
<a id='line_14042'>  He strove, assum'd Meticus' form again,</a>
<a id='line_14043'>  And, in that imitated shape, restor'd</a>
<a id='line_14044'>  To the despairing prince his Daunian sword.</a>
<a id='line_14045'>  The Queen of Love, who, with disdain and grief,</a>
<a id='line_14046'>  Saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief,</a>
<a id='line_14047'>  T' assert her offspring with a greater deed,</a>
<a id='line_14048'>  From the tough root the ling'ring weapon freed.</a>
<a id='line_14049'></a>
<a id='line_14050'>  Once more erect, the rival chiefs advance:</a>
<a id='line_14051'>  One trusts the sword, and one the pointed lance;</a>

<a id='line_14053'></a>
<a id='line_14054'>  Meantime imperial Jove to Juno spoke,</a>
<a id='line_14055'>  Who from a shining cloud beheld the shock:</a>

<a id='line_14063'>  Is it becoming of the due respect</a>
<a id='line_14064'>  And awful honor of a god elect,</a>
<a id='line_14065'>  A wound unworthy of our state to feel,</a>
<a id='line_14066'>  Patient of human hands and earthly steel?</a>
<a id='line_14067'>  Or seems it just, the sister should restore</a>
<a id='line_14068'>  A second sword, when one was lost before,</a>

<a id='line_14070'>  For what, without thy knowledge and avow,</a>

<a id='line_14079'>  For vengeance, wrath, and unresisted pow'r,</a>

<a id='line_14239'>  He star'd about, nor aid nor issue found;</a>
<a id='line_14240'>  His own men stop the pass, and his own walls surround.</a>
<a id='line_14241'>  Once more he pauses, and looks out again,</a>
<a id='line_14242'>  And seeks the goddess charioteer in vain.</a>
<a id='line_14243'>  Trembling he views the thund'ring chief advance,</a>
<a id='line_14244'>  And brandishing aloft the deadly lance:</a>
<a id='line_14245'>  Amaz'd he cow'rs beneath his conqu'ring foe,</a>
<a id='line_14246'>  Forgets to ward, and waits the coming blow.</a>
<a id='line_14247'>  Astonish'd while he stands, and fix'd with fear,</a>
<a id='line_14248'>  Aim'd at his shield he sees th' impending spear.</a>
<a id='line_14249'></a>
<a id='line_14250'>  The hero measur'd first, with narrow view,</a>
<a id='line_14251'>  The destin'd mark; and, rising as he threw,</a>
<a id='line_14252'>  With its full swing the fatal weapon flew.</a>
<a id='line_14253'>  Not with less rage the rattling thunder falls,</a>
<a id='line_14254'>  Or stones from batt'ring-engines break the walls:</a>
<a id='line_14255'>  Swift as a whirlwind, from an arm so strong,</a>
<a id='line_14256'>  The lance drove on, and bore the death along.</a>
<a id='line_14257'>  Naught could his sev'nfold shield the prince avail,</a>
<a id='line_14258'>  Nor aught, beneath his arms, the coat of mail:</a>
<a id='line_14259'>  It pierc'd thro' all, and with a grisly wound</a>
<a id='line_14260'>  Transfix'd his thigh, and doubled him to ground.</a>
<a id='line_14261'>  With groans the Latins rend the vaulted sky:</a>
<a id='line_14262'>  Woods, hills, and valleys, to the voice reply.</a>
<a id='line_14263'></a>
<a id='line_14264'>  Now low on earth the lofty chief is laid,</a>
<a id='line_14265'>  With eyes cast upward, and with arms display'd,</a>
<a id='line_14266'>  And, recreant, thus to the proud victor pray'd:</a>
<a id='line_14267'>  "I know my death deserv'd, nor hope to live:</a>
<a id='line_14268'>  Use what the gods and thy good fortune give.</a>
<a id='line_14269'>  Yet think, O think, if mercy may be shown-</a>
<a id='line_14270'>  Thou hadst a father once, and hast a son-</a>
<a id='line_14271'>  Pity my sire, now sinking to the grave;</a>
<a id='line_14272'>  And for Anchises' sake old Daunus save!</a>
<a id='line_14273'>  Or, if thy vow'd revenge pursue my death,</a>
<a id='line_14274'>  Give to my friends my body void of breath!</a>
<a id='line_14275'>  The Latian chiefs have seen me beg my life;</a>
<a id='line_14276'>  Thine is the conquest, thine the royal wife:</a>
<a id='line_14277'>  Against a yielded man, 't is mean ignoble strife."</a>
<a id='line_14278'></a>
<a id='line_14279'>  In deep suspense the Trojan seem'd to stand,</a>
<a id='line_14280'>  And, just prepar'd to strike, repress'd his hand.</a>
<a id='line_14281'>  He roll'd his eyes, and ev'ry moment felt</a>
<a id='line_14282'>  His manly soul with more compassion melt;</a>
<a id='line_14283'>  When, casting down a casual glance, he spied</a>
<a id='line_14284'>  The golden belt that glitter'd on his side,</a>
<a id='line_14285'>  The fatal spoils which haughty Turnus tore</a>
<a id='line_14286'>  From dying Pallas, and in triumph wore.</a>
<a id='line_14287'>  Then, rous'd anew to wrath, he loudly cries</a>
<a id='line_14288'>  (Flames, while he spoke, came flashing from his eyes)</a>
<a id='line_14289'>  "Traitor, dost thou, dost thou to grace pretend,</a>
<a id='line_14290'>  Clad, as thou art, in trophies of my friend?</a>
<a id='line_14291'>  To his sad soul a grateful off'ring go!</a>
<a id='line_14292'>  'T is Pallas, Pallas gives this deadly blow."</a>
<a id='line_14293'>  He rais'd his arm aloft, and, at the word,</a>
<a id='line_14294'>  Deep in his bosom drove the shining sword.</a>
<a id='line_14295'>  The streaming blood distain'd his arms around,</a>
<a id='line_14296'>  And the disdainful soul came rushing thro' the wound.</a>
<a id='line_14297'></a>
