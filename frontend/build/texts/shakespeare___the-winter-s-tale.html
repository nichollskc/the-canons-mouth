<a id='line_73'>SCENE I. Sicilia. An Antechamber in Leontes’ Palace.</a>
<a id='line_74'></a>
<a id='line_75'> Enter Camillo and Archidamus.</a>
<a id='line_76'></a>
<a id='line_77'>ARCHIDAMUS.</a>
<a id='line_78'>If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on the like occasion</a>
<a id='line_79'>whereon my services are now on foot, you shall see, as I have said,</a>
<a id='line_80'>great difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.</a>
<a id='line_81'></a>
<a id='line_82'>CAMILLO.</a>
<a id='line_83'>I think this coming summer the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the</a>
<a id='line_84'>visitation which he justly owes him.</a>
<a id='line_85'></a>
<a id='line_86'>ARCHIDAMUS.</a>
<a id='line_87'>Wherein our entertainment shall shame us; we will be justified in our</a>
<a id='line_88'>loves. For indeed,—</a>
<a id='line_89'></a>
<a id='line_90'>CAMILLO.</a>
<a id='line_91'>Beseech you—</a>
<a id='line_92'></a>
<a id='line_93'>ARCHIDAMUS.</a>
<a id='line_94'>Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge. We cannot with such</a>
<a id='line_95'>magnificence—in so rare—I know not what to say. We will give you sleepy</a>
<a id='line_96'>drinks, that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience, may,</a>
<a id='line_97'>though they cannot praise us, as little accuse us.</a>
<a id='line_98'></a>
<a id='line_99'>CAMILLO.</a>
<a id='line_100'>You pay a great deal too dear for what’s given freely.</a>
<a id='line_101'></a>
<a id='line_102'>ARCHIDAMUS.</a>
<a id='line_103'>Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine</a>
<a id='line_104'>honesty puts it to utterance.</a>
<a id='line_105'></a>
<a id='line_106'>CAMILLO.</a>
<a id='line_107'>Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia. They were trained</a>
<a id='line_108'>together in their childhoods, and there rooted betwixt them then such</a>
<a id='line_109'>an affection which cannot choose but branch now. Since their more</a>
<a id='line_110'>mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their</a>
<a id='line_111'>society, their encounters, though not personal, have been royally</a>
<a id='line_112'>attorneyed with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies, that</a>
<a id='line_113'>they have seemed to be together, though absent; shook hands, as over a</a>
<a id='line_114'>vast; and embraced as it were from the ends of opposed winds. The</a>
<a id='line_115'>heavens continue their loves!</a>
<a id='line_116'></a>
<a id='line_117'>ARCHIDAMUS.</a>
<a id='line_118'>I think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it.</a>
<a id='line_119'>You have an unspeakable comfort of your young Prince Mamillius. It is a</a>
<a id='line_120'>gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note.</a>
<a id='line_121'></a>
<a id='line_122'>CAMILLO.</a>
<a id='line_123'>I very well agree with you in the hopes of him. It is a gallant child;</a>
<a id='line_124'>one that indeed physics the subject, makes old hearts fresh. They that</a>
<a id='line_125'>went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a</a>
<a id='line_126'>man.</a>
<a id='line_127'></a>
<a id='line_128'>ARCHIDAMUS.</a>
<a id='line_129'>Would they else be content to die?</a>
<a id='line_130'></a>
<a id='line_131'>CAMILLO.</a>
<a id='line_132'>Yes, if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live.</a>
<a id='line_133'></a>
<a id='line_134'>ARCHIDAMUS.</a>
<a id='line_135'>If the king had no son, they would desire to live on crutches till he</a>
<a id='line_136'>had one.</a>

<a id='line_144'>POLIXENES.</a>
<a id='line_145'>Nine changes of the watery star hath been</a>
<a id='line_146'>The shepherd’s note since we have left our throne</a>
<a id='line_147'>Without a burden. Time as long again</a>
<a id='line_148'>Would be fill’d up, my brother, with our thanks;</a>
<a id='line_149'>And yet we should, for perpetuity,</a>
<a id='line_150'>Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,</a>
<a id='line_151'>Yet standing in rich place, I multiply</a>
<a id='line_152'>With one “we thank you” many thousands more</a>
<a id='line_153'>That go before it.</a>
<a id='line_154'></a>
<a id='line_155'>LEONTES.</a>
<a id='line_156'>Stay your thanks a while,</a>
<a id='line_157'>And pay them when you part.</a>
<a id='line_158'></a>
<a id='line_159'>POLIXENES.</a>
<a id='line_160'>Sir, that’s tomorrow.</a>
<a id='line_161'>I am question’d by my fears, of what may chance</a>
<a id='line_162'>Or breed upon our absence; that may blow</a>
<a id='line_163'>No sneaping winds at home, to make us say</a>
<a id='line_164'>“This is put forth too truly.” Besides, I have stay’d</a>
<a id='line_165'>To tire your royalty.</a>
<a id='line_166'></a>
<a id='line_167'>LEONTES.</a>
<a id='line_168'>We are tougher, brother,</a>
<a id='line_169'>Than you can put us to ’t.</a>
<a id='line_170'></a>
<a id='line_171'>POLIXENES.</a>
<a id='line_172'>No longer stay.</a>
<a id='line_173'></a>
<a id='line_174'>LEONTES.</a>
<a id='line_175'>One seve’night longer.</a>
<a id='line_176'></a>
<a id='line_177'>POLIXENES.</a>
<a id='line_178'>Very sooth, tomorrow.</a>
<a id='line_179'></a>
<a id='line_180'>LEONTES.</a>
<a id='line_181'>We’ll part the time between ’s then: and in that</a>
<a id='line_182'>I’ll no gainsaying.</a>
<a id='line_183'></a>
<a id='line_184'>POLIXENES.</a>
<a id='line_185'>Press me not, beseech you, so,</a>
<a id='line_186'>There is no tongue that moves, none, none i’ th’ world,</a>
<a id='line_187'>So soon as yours, could win me: so it should now,</a>
<a id='line_188'>Were there necessity in your request, although</a>
<a id='line_189'>’Twere needful I denied it. My affairs</a>
<a id='line_190'>Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder</a>
<a id='line_191'>Were, in your love a whip to me; my stay</a>
<a id='line_192'>To you a charge and trouble: to save both,</a>
<a id='line_193'>Farewell, our brother.</a>
<a id='line_194'></a>
<a id='line_195'>LEONTES.</a>
<a id='line_196'>Tongue-tied, our queen? Speak you.</a>
<a id='line_197'></a>
<a id='line_198'>HERMIONE.</a>
<a id='line_199'>I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until</a>
<a id='line_200'>You had drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,</a>
<a id='line_201'>Charge him too coldly. Tell him you are sure</a>
<a id='line_202'>All in Bohemia’s well: this satisfaction</a>
<a id='line_203'>The by-gone day proclaimed. Say this to him,</a>
<a id='line_204'>He’s beat from his best ward.</a>
<a id='line_205'></a>
<a id='line_206'>LEONTES.</a>
<a id='line_207'>Well said, Hermione.</a>
<a id='line_208'></a>
<a id='line_209'>HERMIONE.</a>
<a id='line_210'>To tell he longs to see his son were strong.</a>
<a id='line_211'>But let him say so then, and let him go;</a>
<a id='line_212'>But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,</a>
<a id='line_213'>We’ll thwack him hence with distaffs.</a>
<a id='line_214'>[_To Polixenes._] Yet of your royal presence I’ll adventure</a>
<a id='line_215'>The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia</a>
<a id='line_216'>You take my lord, I’ll give him my commission</a>
<a id='line_217'>To let him there a month behind the gest</a>
<a id='line_218'>Prefix’d for’s parting:—yet, good deed, Leontes,</a>
<a id='line_219'>I love thee not a jar of th’ clock behind</a>
<a id='line_220'>What lady she her lord. You’ll stay?</a>
<a id='line_221'></a>
<a id='line_222'>POLIXENES.</a>
<a id='line_223'>No, madam.</a>
<a id='line_224'></a>
<a id='line_225'>HERMIONE.</a>
<a id='line_226'>Nay, but you will?</a>
<a id='line_227'></a>
<a id='line_228'>POLIXENES.</a>
<a id='line_229'>I may not, verily.</a>
<a id='line_230'></a>
<a id='line_231'>HERMIONE.</a>
<a id='line_232'>Verily!</a>
<a id='line_233'>You put me off with limber vows; but I,</a>
<a id='line_234'>Though you would seek t’ unsphere the stars with oaths,</a>
<a id='line_235'>Should yet say “Sir, no going.” Verily,</a>
<a id='line_236'>You shall not go. A lady’s verily is</a>
<a id='line_237'>As potent as a lord’s. Will go yet?</a>
<a id='line_238'>Force me to keep you as a prisoner,</a>
<a id='line_239'>Not like a guest: so you shall pay your fees</a>
<a id='line_240'>When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?</a>
<a id='line_241'>My prisoner or my guest? By your dread “verily,”</a>
<a id='line_242'>One of them you shall be.</a>
<a id='line_243'></a>
<a id='line_244'>POLIXENES.</a>
<a id='line_245'>Your guest, then, madam.</a>
<a id='line_246'>To be your prisoner should import offending;</a>
<a id='line_247'>Which is for me less easy to commit</a>
<a id='line_248'>Than you to punish.</a>
<a id='line_249'></a>
<a id='line_250'>HERMIONE.</a>
<a id='line_251'>Not your gaoler then,</a>
<a id='line_252'>But your kind hostess. Come, I’ll question you</a>
<a id='line_253'>Of my lord’s tricks and yours when you were boys.</a>
<a id='line_254'>You were pretty lordings then.</a>
<a id='line_255'></a>
<a id='line_256'>POLIXENES.</a>
<a id='line_257'>We were, fair queen,</a>
<a id='line_258'>Two lads that thought there was no more behind</a>
<a id='line_259'>But such a day tomorrow as today,</a>
<a id='line_260'>And to be boy eternal.</a>
<a id='line_261'></a>
<a id='line_262'>HERMIONE.</a>
<a id='line_263'>Was not my lord</a>
<a id='line_264'>The verier wag o’ th’ two?</a>
<a id='line_265'></a>
<a id='line_266'>POLIXENES.</a>
<a id='line_267'>We were as twinn’d lambs that did frisk i’ th’ sun</a>
<a id='line_268'>And bleat the one at th’ other. What we chang’d</a>
<a id='line_269'>Was innocence for innocence; we knew not</a>
<a id='line_270'>The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream’d</a>
<a id='line_271'>That any did. Had we pursu’d that life,</a>
<a id='line_272'>And our weak spirits ne’er been higher rear’d</a>
<a id='line_273'>With stronger blood, we should have answer’d heaven</a>
<a id='line_274'>Boldly “Not guilty,” the imposition clear’d</a>
<a id='line_275'>Hereditary ours.</a>
<a id='line_276'></a>
<a id='line_277'>HERMIONE.</a>
<a id='line_278'>By this we gather</a>
<a id='line_279'>You have tripp’d since.</a>
<a id='line_280'></a>
<a id='line_281'>POLIXENES.</a>
<a id='line_282'>O my most sacred lady,</a>
<a id='line_283'>Temptations have since then been born to ’s! for</a>
<a id='line_284'>In those unfledg’d days was my wife a girl;</a>
<a id='line_285'>Your precious self had then not cross’d the eyes</a>
<a id='line_286'>Of my young play-fellow.</a>
<a id='line_287'></a>
<a id='line_288'>HERMIONE.</a>
<a id='line_289'>Grace to boot!</a>
<a id='line_290'>Of this make no conclusion, lest you say</a>
<a id='line_291'>Your queen and I are devils. Yet go on;</a>
<a id='line_292'>Th’ offences we have made you do we’ll answer,</a>
<a id='line_293'>If you first sinn’d with us, and that with us</a>
<a id='line_294'>You did continue fault, and that you slipp’d not</a>
<a id='line_295'>With any but with us.</a>
<a id='line_296'></a>
<a id='line_297'>LEONTES.</a>
<a id='line_298'>Is he won yet?</a>
<a id='line_299'></a>
<a id='line_300'>HERMIONE.</a>
<a id='line_301'>He’ll stay, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_302'></a>
<a id='line_303'>LEONTES.</a>
<a id='line_304'>At my request he would not.</a>
<a id='line_305'>Hermione, my dearest, thou never spok’st</a>
<a id='line_306'>To better purpose.</a>
<a id='line_307'></a>
<a id='line_308'>HERMIONE.</a>
<a id='line_309'>Never?</a>
<a id='line_310'></a>
<a id='line_311'>LEONTES.</a>
<a id='line_312'>Never but once.</a>
<a id='line_313'></a>
<a id='line_314'>HERMIONE.</a>
<a id='line_315'>What! have I twice said well? when was’t before?</a>
<a id='line_316'>I prithee tell me. Cram ’s with praise, and make ’s</a>
<a id='line_317'>As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless</a>
<a id='line_318'>Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.</a>
<a id='line_319'>Our praises are our wages. You may ride ’s</a>
<a id='line_320'>With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere</a>
<a id='line_321'>With spur we heat an acre. But to th’ goal:</a>
<a id='line_322'>My last good deed was to entreat his stay.</a>
<a id='line_323'>What was my first? It has an elder sister,</a>
<a id='line_324'>Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!</a>
<a id='line_325'>But once before I spoke to the purpose—when?</a>
<a id='line_326'>Nay, let me have’t; I long.</a>
<a id='line_327'></a>
<a id='line_328'>LEONTES.</a>
<a id='line_329'>Why, that was when</a>
<a id='line_330'>Three crabbed months had sour’d themselves to death,</a>
<a id='line_331'>Ere I could make thee open thy white hand</a>
<a id='line_332'>And clap thyself my love; then didst thou utter</a>
<a id='line_333'>“I am yours for ever.”</a>
<a id='line_334'></a>
<a id='line_335'>HERMIONE.</a>
<a id='line_336'>’Tis Grace indeed.</a>
<a id='line_337'>Why, lo you now, I have spoke to th’ purpose twice.</a>
<a id='line_338'>The one for ever earn’d a royal husband;</a>
<a id='line_339'>Th’ other for some while a friend.</a>
<a id='line_340'></a>
<a id='line_341'> [_Giving her hand to Polixenes._]</a>
<a id='line_342'></a>
<a id='line_343'>LEONTES.</a>
<a id='line_344'>[_Aside._] Too hot, too hot!</a>
<a id='line_345'>To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.</a>
<a id='line_346'>I have _tremor cordis_ on me. My heart dances,</a>
<a id='line_347'>But not for joy,—not joy. This entertainment</a>
<a id='line_348'>May a free face put on, derive a liberty</a>
<a id='line_349'>From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,</a>
<a id='line_350'>And well become the agent: ’t may, I grant:</a>
<a id='line_351'>But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,</a>
<a id='line_352'>As now they are, and making practis’d smiles</a>
<a id='line_353'>As in a looking-glass; and then to sigh, as ’twere</a>
<a id='line_354'>The mort o’ th’ deer. O, that is entertainment</a>
<a id='line_355'>My bosom likes not, nor my brows. Mamillius,</a>
<a id='line_356'>Art thou my boy?</a>
<a id='line_357'></a>
<a id='line_358'>MAMILLIUS.</a>
<a id='line_359'>Ay, my good lord.</a>
<a id='line_360'></a>
<a id='line_361'>LEONTES.</a>
<a id='line_362'>I’ fecks!</a>
<a id='line_363'>Why, that’s my bawcock. What! hast smutch’d thy nose?</a>
<a id='line_364'>They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,</a>
<a id='line_365'>We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:</a>
<a id='line_366'>And yet the steer, the heifer, and the calf</a>
<a id='line_367'>Are all call’d neat.—Still virginalling</a>
<a id='line_368'>Upon his palm?—How now, you wanton calf!</a>
<a id='line_369'>Art thou my calf?</a>
<a id='line_370'></a>
<a id='line_371'>MAMILLIUS.</a>
<a id='line_372'>Yes, if you will, my lord.</a>
<a id='line_373'></a>
<a id='line_374'>LEONTES.</a>
<a id='line_375'>Thou want’st a rough pash and the shoots that I have</a>
<a id='line_376'>To be full like me:—yet they say we are</a>

<a id='line_411'>No, in good earnest.</a>
<a id='line_412'>How sometimes nature will betray its folly,</a>

<a id='line_751'>Good day, Camillo.</a>
<a id='line_752'></a>
<a id='line_753'>CAMILLO.</a>
<a id='line_754'>Hail, most royal sir!</a>

<a id='line_762'>POLIXENES.</a>
<a id='line_763'>The king hath on him such a countenance</a>
<a id='line_764'>As he had lost some province, and a region</a>
<a id='line_765'>Lov’d as he loves himself. Even now I met him</a>
<a id='line_766'>With customary compliment, when he,</a>
<a id='line_767'>Wafting his eyes to the contrary, and falling</a>
<a id='line_768'>A lip of much contempt, speeds from me, and</a>
<a id='line_769'>So leaves me to consider what is breeding</a>
<a id='line_770'>That changes thus his manners.</a>
<a id='line_771'></a>
<a id='line_772'>CAMILLO.</a>
<a id='line_773'>I dare not know, my lord.</a>

<a id='line_775'>POLIXENES.</a>
<a id='line_776'>How, dare not? Do not? Do you know, and dare not?</a>
<a id='line_777'>Be intelligent to me? ’Tis thereabouts;</a>
<a id='line_778'>For, to yourself, what you do know, you must,</a>
<a id='line_779'>And cannot say you dare not. Good Camillo,</a>
<a id='line_780'>Your chang’d complexions are to me a mirror</a>
<a id='line_781'>Which shows me mine chang’d too; for I must be</a>
<a id='line_782'>A party in this alteration, finding</a>
<a id='line_783'>Myself thus alter’d with’t.</a>
<a id='line_784'></a>
<a id='line_785'>CAMILLO.</a>
<a id='line_786'>There is a sickness</a>
<a id='line_787'>Which puts some of us in distemper, but</a>
<a id='line_788'>I cannot name the disease, and it is caught</a>
<a id='line_789'>Of you that yet are well.</a>
<a id='line_790'></a>
<a id='line_791'>POLIXENES.</a>
<a id='line_792'>How caught of me?</a>
<a id='line_793'>Make me not sighted like the basilisk.</a>
<a id='line_794'>I have look’d on thousands who have sped the better</a>
<a id='line_795'>By my regard, but kill’d none so. Camillo,—</a>
<a id='line_796'>As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto</a>
<a id='line_797'>Clerk-like, experienc’d, which no less adorns</a>
<a id='line_798'>Our gentry than our parents’ noble names,</a>
<a id='line_799'>In whose success we are gentle,—I beseech you,</a>
<a id='line_800'>If you know aught which does behove my knowledge</a>
<a id='line_801'>Thereof to be inform’d, imprison’t not</a>
<a id='line_802'>In ignorant concealment.</a>
<a id='line_803'></a>
<a id='line_804'>CAMILLO.</a>
<a id='line_805'>I may not answer.</a>
<a id='line_806'></a>
<a id='line_807'>POLIXENES.</a>
<a id='line_808'>A sickness caught of me, and yet I well?</a>
<a id='line_809'>I must be answer’d. Dost thou hear, Camillo,</a>
<a id='line_810'>I conjure thee, by all the parts of man</a>
<a id='line_811'>Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least</a>
<a id='line_812'>Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare</a>
<a id='line_813'>What incidency thou dost guess of harm</a>
<a id='line_814'>Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;</a>
<a id='line_815'>Which way to be prevented, if to be;</a>
<a id='line_816'>If not, how best to bear it.</a>
<a id='line_817'></a>
<a id='line_818'>CAMILLO.</a>
<a id='line_819'>Sir, I will tell you;</a>
<a id='line_820'>Since I am charg’d in honour, and by him</a>
<a id='line_821'>That I think honourable. Therefore mark my counsel,</a>
<a id='line_822'>Which must be ev’n as swiftly follow’d as</a>
<a id='line_823'>I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me</a>
<a id='line_824'>Cry lost, and so goodnight!</a>
<a id='line_825'></a>

<a id='line_839'>For what?</a>
<a id='line_840'></a>
<a id='line_841'>CAMILLO.</a>
<a id='line_842'>He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,</a>
<a id='line_843'>As he had seen’t or been an instrument</a>

<a id='line_853'>Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn’d,</a>
<a id='line_854'>Nay, hated too, worse than the great’st infection</a>

<a id='line_856'></a>
<a id='line_857'>CAMILLO.</a>
<a id='line_858'>Swear his thought over</a>
<a id='line_859'>By each particular star in heaven and</a>

<a id='line_879'>My fortunes to your service, which are here</a>

<a id='line_881'>For, by the honour of my parents, I</a>
<a id='line_882'>Have utter’d truth: which if you seek to prove,</a>
<a id='line_883'>I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer</a>
<a id='line_884'>Than one condemned by the king’s own mouth,</a>
<a id='line_885'>Thereon his execution sworn.</a>

<a id='line_888'>I do believe thee.</a>

<a id='line_890'>Be pilot to me, and thy places shall</a>
<a id='line_891'>Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready, and</a>
<a id='line_892'>My people did expect my hence departure</a>
<a id='line_893'>Two days ago. This jealousy</a>

<a id='line_897'>He is dishonour’d by a man which ever</a>
<a id='line_898'>Profess’d to him, why, his revenges must</a>

<a id='line_2444'>It is fifteen years since I saw my country. Though I have for the most</a>
<a id='line_2445'>part been aired abroad, I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the</a>
<a id='line_2446'>penitent king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling sorrows I</a>

<a id='line_2452'>leaving me now: the need I have of thee, thine own goodness hath made;</a>
<a id='line_2453'>better not to have had thee than thus to want thee. Thou, having made</a>
<a id='line_2454'>me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must</a>
<a id='line_2455'>either stay to execute them thyself, or take away with thee the very</a>
<a id='line_2456'>services thou hast done, which if I have not enough considered (as too</a>
<a id='line_2457'>much I cannot) to be more thankful to thee shall be my study; and my</a>
<a id='line_2458'>profit therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country Sicilia,</a>
<a id='line_2459'>prithee speak no more; whose very naming punishes me with the</a>

<a id='line_2461'>my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even</a>

<a id='line_2474'>I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some care; so far that I</a>

<a id='line_2476'>have this intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a most</a>
<a id='line_2477'>homely shepherd, a man, they say, that from very nothing, and beyond</a>
<a id='line_2478'>the imagination of his neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.</a>

<a id='line_3274'>Your heart is full of something that does take</a>
<a id='line_3275'>Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young</a>

<a id='line_3578'>Sir, I think</a>

<a id='line_3589'>Well, my lord,</a>
<a id='line_3590'>If you may please to think I love the king,</a>

<a id='line_3592'>Your gracious self, embrace but my direction,</a>
<a id='line_3593'>If your more ponderous and settled project</a>
<a id='line_3594'>May suffer alteration. On mine honour,</a>
<a id='line_3595'>I’ll point you where you shall have such receiving</a>
<a id='line_3596'>As shall become your highness; where you may</a>

<a id='line_3598'>There’s no disjunction to be made, but by,</a>
<a id='line_3599'>As heavens forfend, your ruin. Marry her,</a>

<a id='line_3610'>CAMILLO.</a>
<a id='line_3611'>Have you thought on</a>

<a id='line_3630'>His welcomes forth; asks thee, the son, forgiveness,</a>
<a id='line_3631'>As ’twere i’ th’ father’s person; kisses the hands</a>
<a id='line_3632'>Of your fresh princess; o’er and o’er divides him</a>

<a id='line_3638'>Worthy Camillo,</a>

<a id='line_3641'></a>
<a id='line_3642'>CAMILLO.</a>
<a id='line_3643'>Sent by the king your father</a>

<a id='line_3645'>The manner of your bearing towards him, with</a>
<a id='line_3646'>What you (as from your father) shall deliver,</a>
<a id='line_3647'>Things known betwixt us three, I’ll write you down,</a>
<a id='line_3648'>The which shall point you forth at every sitting</a>
<a id='line_3649'>What you must say; that he shall not perceive</a>
<a id='line_3650'>But that you have your father’s bosom there</a>
<a id='line_3651'>And speak his very heart.</a>

<a id='line_3653'>FLORIZEL.</a>
<a id='line_3654'>I am bound to you:</a>
<a id='line_3655'>There is some sap in this.</a>
<a id='line_3656'></a>
<a id='line_3657'>CAMILLO.</a>
<a id='line_3658'>A course more promising</a>
<a id='line_3659'>Than a wild dedication of yourselves</a>
<a id='line_3660'>To unpath’d waters, undream’d shores, most certain</a>
<a id='line_3661'>To miseries enough: no hope to help you,</a>
<a id='line_3662'>But as you shake off one to take another:</a>
<a id='line_3663'>Nothing so certain as your anchors, who</a>
<a id='line_3664'>Do their best office if they can but stay you</a>
<a id='line_3665'>Where you’ll be loath to be. Besides, you know</a>
<a id='line_3666'>Prosperity’s the very bond of love,</a>
<a id='line_3667'>Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together</a>
<a id='line_3668'>Affliction alters.</a>
<a id='line_3669'></a>
<a id='line_3670'>PERDITA.</a>
<a id='line_3671'>One of these is true:</a>
<a id='line_3672'>I think affliction may subdue the cheek,</a>
<a id='line_3673'>But not take in the mind.</a>
<a id='line_3674'></a>
<a id='line_3675'>CAMILLO.</a>
<a id='line_3676'>Yea, say you so?</a>
<a id='line_3677'>There shall not at your father’s house, these seven years</a>

<a id='line_3685'>CAMILLO.</a>
<a id='line_3686'>I cannot say ’tis pity</a>
<a id='line_3687'>She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress</a>

<a id='line_3690'>PERDITA.</a>
<a id='line_3691'>Your pardon, sir; for this</a>

<a id='line_3696'>But, O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,</a>
<a id='line_3697'>Preserver of my father, now of me,</a>

<a id='line_3703'>My lord,</a>
<a id='line_3704'>Fear none of this. I think you know my fortunes</a>
<a id='line_3705'>Do all lie there: it shall be so my care</a>
<a id='line_3706'>To have you royally appointed as if</a>
<a id='line_3707'>The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,</a>
<a id='line_3708'>That you may know you shall not want,—one word.</a>
<a id='line_3709'>[_They talk aside._]</a>
<a id='line_3710'></a>

<a id='line_3712'></a>
<a id='line_3713'>AUTOLYCUS.</a>
<a id='line_3714'>Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his sworn brother, a very</a>
<a id='line_3715'>simple gentleman! I have sold all my trumpery. Not a counterfeit stone,</a>
<a id='line_3716'>not a ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad, knife, tape,</a>
<a id='line_3717'>glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, to keep my pack from fasting.</a>
<a id='line_3718'>They throng who should buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallowed</a>
<a id='line_3719'>and brought a benediction to the buyer: by which means I saw whose</a>
<a id='line_3720'>purse was best in picture; and what I saw, to my good use I remembered.</a>
<a id='line_3721'>My clown (who wants but something to be a reasonable man) grew so in</a>
<a id='line_3722'>love with the wenches’ song that he would not stir his pettitoes till</a>
<a id='line_3723'>he had both tune and words; which so drew the rest of the herd to me</a>
<a id='line_3724'>that all their other senses stuck in ears: you might have pinched a</a>
<a id='line_3725'>placket, it was senseless; ’twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse;</a>
<a id='line_3726'>I would have filed keys off that hung in chains: no hearing, no</a>
<a id='line_3727'>feeling, but my sir’s song, and admiring the nothing of it. So that in</a>
<a id='line_3728'>this time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their festival purses;</a>
<a id='line_3729'>and had not the old man come in with a whoobub against his daughter and</a>
<a id='line_3730'>the king’s son, and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not left a</a>

<a id='line_3793'>Fortunate mistress,—let my prophecy</a>
<a id='line_3794'>Come home to you!—you must retire yourself</a>
<a id='line_3795'>Into some covert. Take your sweetheart’s hat</a>

<a id='line_3845'>I understand the business, I hear it. To have an open ear, a quick eye,</a>
<a id='line_3846'>and a nimble hand, is necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is</a>

<a id='line_3848'>the time that the unjust man doth thrive. What an exchange had this</a>
<a id='line_3849'>been without boot! What a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the</a>
<a id='line_3850'>gods do this year connive at us, and we may do anything extempore. The</a>
<a id='line_3851'>prince himself is about a piece of iniquity, stealing away from his</a>
<a id='line_3852'>father with his clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of</a>

<a id='line_4006'>all come under the hangman: which, though it be great pity, yet it is</a>
<a id='line_4007'>necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue, a ram-tender, to offer to have</a>
<a id='line_4008'>his daughter come into grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that</a>
<a id='line_4009'>death is too soft for him, say I. Draw our throne into a sheepcote! All</a>
<a id='line_4010'>deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.</a>

<a id='line_4018'>and a dram dead; then recovered again with aqua-vitæ or some other hot</a>
<a id='line_4019'>infusion; then, raw as he is, and in the hottest day prognostication</a>

<a id='line_4021'>southward eye upon him, where he is to behold him with flies blown to</a>
<a id='line_4022'>death. But what talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries are</a>
<a id='line_4023'>to be smiled at, their offences being so capital? Tell me (for you seem</a>
<a id='line_4024'>to be honest plain men) what you have to the king. Being something</a>
<a id='line_4025'>gently considered, I’ll bring you where he is aboard, tender your</a>

<a id='line_4029'>CLOWN.</a>
<a id='line_4030'>He seems to be of great authority: close with him, give him gold; and</a>

<a id='line_4345'>By his command</a>

<a id='line_4347'>Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,</a>

<a id='line_4349'>Which waits upon worn times, hath something seiz’d</a>

<a id='line_4363'>Expos’d this paragon to the fearful usage,</a>
<a id='line_4364'>At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,</a>

<a id='line_4480'>Remember since you ow’d no more to time</a>

<a id='line_4482'>Step forth mine advocate. At your request</a>
<a id='line_4483'>My father will grant precious things as trifles.</a>

<a id='line_4494'></a>
<a id='line_4495'>LEONTES.</a>
<a id='line_4496'>I thought of her</a>
<a id='line_4497'>Even in these looks I made. [_To Florizel._] But your petition</a>
<a id='line_4498'>Is yet unanswer’d. I will to your father.</a>
<a id='line_4499'>Your honour not o’erthrown by your desires,</a>
<a id='line_4500'>I am friend to them and you: upon which errand</a>

<a id='line_4506'>SCENE II. The same. Before the Palace.</a>
<a id='line_4507'></a>
<a id='line_4508'> Enter Autolycus and a Gentleman.</a>
<a id='line_4509'></a>
<a id='line_4510'>AUTOLYCUS.</a>
<a id='line_4511'>Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?</a>
<a id='line_4512'></a>
<a id='line_4513'>FIRST GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_4514'>I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old shepherd deliver</a>
<a id='line_4515'>the manner how he found it: whereupon, after a little amazedness, we</a>
<a id='line_4516'>were all commanded out of the chamber; only this, methought I heard the</a>
<a id='line_4517'>shepherd say he found the child.</a>
<a id='line_4518'></a>
<a id='line_4519'>AUTOLYCUS.</a>
<a id='line_4520'>I would most gladly know the issue of it.</a>
<a id='line_4521'></a>
<a id='line_4522'>FIRST GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_4523'>I make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes I perceived</a>
<a id='line_4524'>in the king and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They seemed</a>
<a id='line_4525'>almost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes.</a>
<a id='line_4526'>There was speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture;</a>
<a id='line_4527'>they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed, or one destroyed. A</a>
<a id='line_4528'>notable passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest beholder,</a>
<a id='line_4529'>that knew no more but seeing could not say if th’ importance were joy</a>
<a id='line_4530'>or sorrow; but in the extremity of the one, it must needs be. Here</a>
<a id='line_4531'>comes a gentleman that happily knows more.</a>
<a id='line_4532'></a>
<a id='line_4533'> Enter a Gentleman.</a>
<a id='line_4534'></a>
<a id='line_4535'>The news, Rogero?</a>
<a id='line_4536'></a>
<a id='line_4537'>SECOND GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_4538'>Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled: the king’s daughter is</a>
<a id='line_4539'>found: such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that</a>
<a id='line_4540'>ballad-makers cannot be able to express it. Here comes the Lady</a>
<a id='line_4541'>Paulina’s steward: he can deliver you more.</a>
<a id='line_4542'></a>
<a id='line_4543'> Enter a third Gentleman.</a>
<a id='line_4544'></a>
<a id='line_4545'> How goes it now, sir? This news, which is called true, is so like an</a>
<a id='line_4546'> old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the king</a>
<a id='line_4547'> found his heir?</a>
<a id='line_4548'></a>
<a id='line_4549'>THIRD GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_4550'>Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance. That which you</a>
<a id='line_4551'>hear you’ll swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The</a>
<a id='line_4552'>mantle of Queen Hermione’s, her jewel about the neck of it, the letters</a>
<a id='line_4553'>of Antigonus found with it, which they know to be his character; the</a>
<a id='line_4554'>majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection of</a>
<a id='line_4555'>nobleness which nature shows above her breeding, and many other</a>
<a id='line_4556'>evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the king’s daughter.</a>
<a id='line_4557'>Did you see the meeting of the two kings?</a>
<a id='line_4558'></a>
<a id='line_4559'>SECOND GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_4560'>No.</a>
<a id='line_4561'></a>
<a id='line_4562'>THIRD GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_4563'>Then you have lost a sight which was to be seen, cannot be spoken of.</a>
<a id='line_4564'>There might you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in such</a>
<a id='line_4565'>manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their joy</a>
<a id='line_4566'>waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with</a>
<a id='line_4567'>countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment,</a>
<a id='line_4568'>not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of himself for joy of</a>
<a id='line_4569'>his found daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss, cries “O,</a>
<a id='line_4570'>thy mother, thy mother!” then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then embraces</a>
<a id='line_4571'>his son-in-law; then again worries he his daughter with clipping her;</a>
<a id='line_4572'>now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten</a>
<a id='line_4573'>conduit of many kings’ reigns. I never heard of such another encounter,</a>
<a id='line_4574'>which lames report to follow it, and undoes description to do it.</a>
<a id='line_4575'></a>
<a id='line_4576'>SECOND GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_4577'>What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried hence the child?</a>
<a id='line_4578'></a>
<a id='line_4579'>THIRD GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_4580'>Like an old tale still, which will have matter to rehearse, though</a>
<a id='line_4581'>credit be asleep and not an ear open. He was torn to pieces with a</a>
<a id='line_4582'>bear: this avouches the shepherd’s son, who has not only his innocence,</a>
<a id='line_4583'>which seems much, to justify him, but a handkerchief and rings of his</a>
<a id='line_4584'>that Paulina knows.</a>
<a id='line_4585'></a>
<a id='line_4586'>FIRST GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_4587'>What became of his bark and his followers?</a>
<a id='line_4588'></a>
<a id='line_4589'>THIRD GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_4590'>Wrecked the same instant of their master’s death, and in the view of</a>
<a id='line_4591'>the shepherd: so that all the instruments which aided to expose the</a>
<a id='line_4592'>child were even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble combat</a>
<a id='line_4593'>that ’twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina! She had one eye</a>
<a id='line_4594'>declined for the loss of her husband, another elevated that the oracle</a>
<a id='line_4595'>was fulfilled. She lifted the princess from the earth, and so locks her</a>
<a id='line_4596'>in embracing, as if she would pin her to her heart, that she might no</a>
<a id='line_4597'>more be in danger of losing.</a>
<a id='line_4598'></a>
<a id='line_4599'>FIRST GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_4600'>The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes;</a>
<a id='line_4601'>for by such was it acted.</a>
<a id='line_4602'></a>
<a id='line_4603'>THIRD GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_4604'>One of the prettiest touches of all, and that which angled for mine</a>
<a id='line_4605'>eyes (caught the water, though not the fish) was, when at the relation</a>
<a id='line_4606'>of the queen’s death (with the manner how she came to it bravely</a>
<a id='line_4607'>confessed and lamented by the king) how attentivenes wounded his</a>
<a id='line_4608'>daughter; till, from one sign of dolour to another, she did, with an</a>
<a id='line_4609'>“Alas,” I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my heart wept</a>
<a id='line_4610'>blood. Who was most marble there changed colour; some swooned, all</a>
<a id='line_4611'>sorrowed: if all the world could have seen it, the woe had been</a>
<a id='line_4612'>universal.</a>
<a id='line_4613'></a>
<a id='line_4614'>FIRST GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_4615'>Are they returned to the court?</a>
<a id='line_4616'></a>
<a id='line_4617'>THIRD GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_4618'>No: the princess hearing of her mother’s statue, which is in the</a>
<a id='line_4619'>keeping of Paulina,—a piece many years in doing and now newly performed</a>
<a id='line_4620'>by that rare Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself</a>
<a id='line_4621'>eternity, and could put breath into his work, would beguile Nature of</a>
<a id='line_4622'>her custom, so perfectly he is her ape: he so near to Hermione hath</a>
<a id='line_4623'>done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of</a>
<a id='line_4624'>answer. Thither with all greediness of affection are they gone, and</a>
<a id='line_4625'>there they intend to sup.</a>
<a id='line_4626'></a>
<a id='line_4627'>SECOND GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_4628'>I thought she had some great matter there in hand; for she hath</a>
<a id='line_4629'>privately twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione,</a>
<a id='line_4630'>visited that removed house. Shall we thither, and with our company</a>
<a id='line_4631'>piece the rejoicing?</a>
<a id='line_4632'></a>
<a id='line_4633'>FIRST GENTLEMAN.</a>
<a id='line_4634'>Who would be thence that has the benefit of access? Every wink of an</a>
<a id='line_4635'>eye some new grace will be born. Our absence makes us unthrifty to our</a>
<a id='line_4636'>knowledge. Let’s along.</a>

<a id='line_4641'>Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, would preferment drop</a>
<a id='line_4642'>on my head. I brought the old man and his son aboard the prince; told</a>
<a id='line_4643'>him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not what. But he at that</a>
<a id='line_4644'>time over-fond of the shepherd’s daughter (so he then took her to be),</a>
<a id='line_4645'>who began to be much sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of</a>
<a id='line_4646'>weather continuing, this mystery remained undiscover’d. But ’tis all</a>
<a id='line_4647'>one to me; for had I been the finder-out of this secret, it would not</a>

<a id='line_4658'></a>
<a id='line_4659'>CLOWN.</a>
<a id='line_4660'>You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me this other day,</a>
<a id='line_4661'>because I was no gentleman born. See you these clothes? Say you see</a>
<a id='line_4662'>them not and think me still no gentleman born: you were best say these</a>
<a id='line_4663'>robes are not gentlemen born. Give me the lie, do; and try whether I am</a>

<a id='line_4675'>CLOWN.</a>
<a id='line_4676'>So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my father; for the</a>

<a id='line_4755'>We honour you with trouble. But we came</a>

<a id='line_4757'>Have we pass’d through, not without much content</a>
<a id='line_4758'>In many singularities; but we saw not</a>

<a id='line_4769'>Still sleep mock’d death. Behold, and say ’tis well.</a>
<a id='line_4770'></a>
<a id='line_4771'> Paulina undraws a curtain, and discovers Hermione standing as a</a>

<a id='line_4774'>I like your silence, it the more shows off</a>

<a id='line_4781'>Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she</a>
<a id='line_4782'>In thy not chiding; for she was as tender</a>
<a id='line_4783'>As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,</a>
<a id='line_4784'>Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing</a>
<a id='line_4785'>So aged as this seems.</a>

<a id='line_4789'></a>

<a id='line_4800'>As now it coldly stands, when first I woo’d her!</a>
<a id='line_4801'>I am asham’d: does not the stone rebuke me</a>

<a id='line_4803'>There’s magic in thy majesty, which has</a>
<a id='line_4804'>My evils conjur’d to remembrance and</a>
<a id='line_4805'>From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,</a>

<a id='line_4821'>My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,</a>

<a id='line_4823'>So many summers dry. Scarce any joy</a>

<a id='line_4860'></a>
<a id='line_4861'>PAULINA.</a>
<a id='line_4862'>I’ll draw the curtain:</a>
<a id='line_4863'>My lord’s almost so far transported that</a>

<a id='line_4866'>LEONTES.</a>
<a id='line_4867'>O sweet Paulina,</a>
<a id='line_4868'>Make me to think so twenty years together!</a>
<a id='line_4869'>No settled senses of the world can match</a>
<a id='line_4870'>The pleasure of that madness. Let ’t alone.</a>
<a id='line_4871'></a>
<a id='line_4872'>PAULINA.</a>
<a id='line_4873'>I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr’d you: but</a>

<a id='line_4875'></a>
<a id='line_4876'>LEONTES.</a>
<a id='line_4877'>Do, Paulina;</a>
<a id='line_4878'>For this affliction has a taste as sweet</a>
<a id='line_4879'>As any cordial comfort. Still methinks</a>
<a id='line_4880'>There is an air comes from her. What fine chisel</a>
<a id='line_4881'>Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,</a>
<a id='line_4882'>For I will kiss her!</a>
<a id='line_4883'></a>

<a id='line_4885'>Good my lord, forbear:</a>
<a id='line_4886'>The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;</a>
<a id='line_4887'>You’ll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own</a>
<a id='line_4888'>With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?</a>
<a id='line_4889'></a>
<a id='line_4890'>LEONTES.</a>
<a id='line_4891'>No, not these twenty years.</a>
<a id='line_4892'></a>
<a id='line_4893'>PERDITA.</a>
<a id='line_4894'>So long could I</a>

<a id='line_4913'>It is requir’d</a>
