<a id='line_12'>      After the extinction of paganism, the Christians in peace and</a>
<a id='line_13'>      piety might have enjoyed their solitary triumph. But the</a>
<a id='line_14'>      principle of discord was alive in their bosom, and they were more</a>
<a id='line_15'>      solicitous to explore the nature, than to practice the laws, of</a>
<a id='line_16'>      their founder. I have already observed, that the disputes of the</a>
<a id='line_17'>      Trinity were succeeded by those of the Incarnation; alike</a>
<a id='line_18'>      scandalous to the church, alike pernicious to the state, still</a>
<a id='line_19'>      more minute in their origin, still more durable in their effects.</a>
<a id='line_20'></a>
<a id='line_21'>      It is my design to comprise in the present chapter a religious</a>
<a id='line_22'>      war of two hundred and fifty years, to represent the</a>
<a id='line_23'>      ecclesiastical and political schism of the Oriental sects, and to</a>
<a id='line_24'>      introduce their clamorous or sanguinary contests, by a modest</a>
<a id='line_25'>      inquiry into the doctrines of the primitive church. 1</a>
<a id='line_26'></a>
<a id='line_27'>      1 (return) [ By what means shall I authenticate this previous</a>
<a id='line_28'>      inquiry, which I have studied to circumscribe and compress?—If I</a>
<a id='line_29'>      persist in supporting each fact or reflection by its proper and</a>
<a id='line_30'>      special evidence, every line would demand a string of</a>
<a id='line_31'>      testimonies, and every note would swell to a critical</a>
<a id='line_32'>      dissertation. But the numberless passages of antiquity which I</a>
<a id='line_33'>      have seen with my own eyes, are compiled, digested and</a>
<a id='line_34'>      illustrated by Petavius and Le Clerc, by Beausobre and Mosheim. I</a>
<a id='line_35'>      shall be content to fortify my narrative by the names and</a>
<a id='line_36'>      characters of these respectable guides; and in the contemplation</a>
<a id='line_37'>      of a minute or remote object, I am not ashamed to borrow the aid</a>
<a id='line_38'>      of the strongest glasses: 1. The Dogmata Theologica of Petavius</a>
<a id='line_39'>      are a work of incredible labor and compass; the volumes which</a>
<a id='line_40'>      relate solely to the Incarnation (two folios, vth and vith, of</a>
<a id='line_41'>      837 pages) are divided into xvi. books—the first of history, the</a>
<a id='line_42'>      remainder of controversy and doctrine. The Jesuit’s learning is</a>
<a id='line_43'>      copious and correct; his Latinity is pure, his method clear, his</a>
<a id='line_44'>      argument profound and well connected; but he is the slave of the</a>
<a id='line_45'>      fathers, the scourge of heretics, and the enemy of truth and</a>
<a id='line_46'>      candor, as often as they are inimical to the Catholic cause. 2.</a>
<a id='line_47'>      The Arminian Le Clerc, who has composed in a quarto volume</a>
<a id='line_48'>      (Amsterdam, 1716) the ecclesiastical history of the two first</a>
<a id='line_49'>      centuries, was free both in his temper and situation; his sense</a>
<a id='line_50'>      is clear, but his thoughts are narrow; he reduces the reason or</a>
<a id='line_51'>      folly of ages to the standard of his private judgment, and his</a>
<a id='line_52'>      impartiality is sometimes quickened, and sometimes tainted by his</a>
<a id='line_53'>      opposition to the fathers. See the heretics (Cerinthians, lxxx.</a>
<a id='line_54'>      Ebionites, ciii. Carpocratians, cxx. Valentiniins, cxxi.</a>
<a id='line_55'>      Basilidians, cxxiii. Marcionites, cxli., &c.) under their proper</a>
<a id='line_56'>      dates. 3. The Histoire Critique du Manicheisme (Amsterdam, 1734,</a>
<a id='line_57'>      1739, in two vols. in 4to., with a posthumous dissertation sur</a>
<a id='line_58'>      les Nazarenes, Lausanne, 1745) of M. de Beausobre is a treasure</a>
<a id='line_59'>      of ancient philosophy and theology. The learned historian spins</a>
<a id='line_60'>      with incomparable art the systematic thread of opinion, and</a>
<a id='line_61'>      transforms himself by turns into the person of a saint, a sage,</a>
<a id='line_62'>      or a heretic. Yet his refinement is sometimes excessive; he</a>
<a id='line_63'>      betrays an amiable partiality in favor of the weaker side, and,</a>
<a id='line_64'>      while he guards against calumny, he does not allow sufficient</a>
<a id='line_65'>      scope for superstition and fanaticism. A copious table of</a>
<a id='line_66'>      contents will direct the reader to any point that he wishes to</a>
<a id='line_67'>      examine. 4. Less profound than Petavius, less independent than Le</a>
<a id='line_68'>      Clerc, less ingenious than Beausobre, the historian Mosheim is</a>
<a id='line_69'>      full, rational, correct, and moderate. In his learned work, De</a>

<a id='line_75'></a>
<a id='line_76'>      I. A laudable regard for the honor of the first proselyte has</a>
<a id='line_77'>      countenanced the belief, the hope, the wish, that the Ebionites,</a>
<a id='line_78'>      or at least the Nazarenes, were distinguished only by their</a>
<a id='line_79'>      obstinate perseverance in the practice of the Mosaic rites.</a>
<a id='line_80'></a>
<a id='line_81'>      Their churches have disappeared, their books are obliterated:</a>
<a id='line_82'>      their obscure freedom might allow a latitude of faith, and the</a>
<a id='line_83'>      softness of their infant creed would be variously moulded by the</a>
<a id='line_84'>      zeal or prudence of three hundred years. Yet the most charitable</a>
<a id='line_85'>      criticism must refuse these sectaries any knowledge of the pure</a>
<a id='line_86'>      and proper divinity of Christ. Educated in the school of Jewish</a>
<a id='line_87'>      prophecy and prejudice, they had never been taught to elevate</a>
<a id='line_88'>      their hopes above a human and temporal Messiah. 2 If they had</a>
<a id='line_89'>      courage to hail their king when he appeared in a plebeian garb,</a>
<a id='line_90'>      their grosser apprehensions were incapable of discerning their</a>
<a id='line_91'>      God, who had studiously disguised his celestial character under</a>
<a id='line_92'>      the name and person of a mortal. 3 The familiar companions of</a>
<a id='line_93'>      Jesus of Nazareth conversed with their friend and countryman,</a>
<a id='line_94'>      who, in all the actions of rational and animal life, appeared of</a>
<a id='line_95'>      the same species with themselves. His progress from infancy to</a>
<a id='line_96'>      youth and manhood was marked by a regular increase in stature and</a>
<a id='line_97'>      wisdom; and after a painful agony of mind and body, he expired on</a>
<a id='line_98'>      the cross. He lived and died for the service of mankind: but the</a>
<a id='line_99'>      life and death of Socrates had likewise been devoted to the cause</a>
<a id='line_100'>      of religion and justice; and although the stoic or the hero may</a>
<a id='line_101'>      disdain the humble virtues of Jesus, the tears which he shed over</a>
<a id='line_102'>      his friend and country may be esteemed the purest evidence of his</a>
<a id='line_103'>      humanity. The miracles of the gospel could not astonish a people</a>
<a id='line_104'>      who held with intrepid faith the more splendid prodigies of the</a>
<a id='line_105'>      Mosaic law. The prophets of ancient days had cured diseases,</a>
<a id='line_106'>      raised the dead, divided the sea, stopped the sun, and ascended</a>
<a id='line_107'>      to heaven in a fiery chariot. And the metaphorical style of the</a>
<a id='line_108'>      Hebrews might ascribe to a saint and martyr the adoptive title of</a>
<a id='line_109'>      Son of God.</a>

<a id='line_123'>      admit every shade of difference, from the vulgar expectation of a</a>

<a id='line_130'>      rarely mentioned by himself or his apostles.]</a>
<a id='line_131'></a>
<a id='line_132'>      Yet in the insufficient creed of the Nazarenes and the Ebionites,</a>
<a id='line_133'>      a distinction is faintly noticed between the heretics, who</a>
<a id='line_134'>      confounded the generation of Christ in the common order of</a>
<a id='line_135'>      nature, and the less guilty schismatics, who revered the</a>
<a id='line_136'>      virginity of his mother, and excluded the aid of an earthly</a>
<a id='line_137'>      father. The incredulity of the former was countenanced by the</a>
<a id='line_138'>      visible circumstances of his birth, the legal marriage of the</a>
<a id='line_139'>      reputed parents, Joseph and Mary, and his lineal claim to the</a>
<a id='line_140'>      kingdom of David and the inheritance of Judah. But the secret and</a>
<a id='line_141'>      authentic history has been recorded in several copies of the</a>
<a id='line_142'>      Gospel according to St. Matthew, 4 which these sectaries long</a>
<a id='line_143'>      preserved in the original Hebrew, 5 as the sole evidence of their</a>
<a id='line_144'>      faith. The natural suspicions of the husband, conscious of his</a>
<a id='line_145'>      own chastity, were dispelled by the assurance (in a dream) that</a>
<a id='line_146'>      his wife was pregnant of the Holy Ghost: and as this distant and</a>
<a id='line_147'>      domestic prodigy could not fall under the personal observation of</a>
<a id='line_148'>      the historian, he must have listened to the same voice which</a>
<a id='line_149'>      dictated to Isaiah the future conception of a virgin. The son of</a>
<a id='line_150'>      a virgin, generated by the ineffable operation of the Holy</a>
<a id='line_151'>      Spirit, was a creature without example or resemblance, superior</a>
<a id='line_152'>      in every attribute of mind and body to the children of Adam.</a>
<a id='line_153'>      Since the introduction of the Greek or Chaldean philosophy, 6 the</a>
<a id='line_154'>      Jews 7 were persuaded of the preexistence, transmigration, and</a>
<a id='line_155'>      immortality of souls; and providence was justified by a</a>
<a id='line_156'>      supposition, that they were confined in their earthly prisons to</a>
<a id='line_157'>      expiate the stains which they had contracted in a former state. 8</a>
<a id='line_158'>      But the degrees of purity and corruption are almost immeasurable.</a>
<a id='line_159'>      It might be fairly presumed, that the most sublime and virtuous</a>
<a id='line_160'>      of human spirits was infused into the offspring of Mary and the</a>
<a id='line_161'>      Holy Ghost; 9 that his abasement was the result of his voluntary</a>
<a id='line_162'>      choice; and that the object of his mission was, to purify, not</a>
<a id='line_163'>      his own, but the sins of the world. On his return to his native</a>
<a id='line_164'>      skies, he received the immense reward of his obedience; the</a>
<a id='line_165'>      everlasting kingdom of the Messiah, which had been darkly</a>
<a id='line_166'>      foretold by the prophets, under the carnal images of peace, of</a>
<a id='line_167'>      conquest, and of dominion. Omnipotence could enlarge the human</a>
<a id='line_168'>      faculties of Christ to the extend of is celestial office. In the</a>
<a id='line_169'>      language of antiquity, the title of God has not been severely</a>
<a id='line_170'>      confined to the first parent, and his incomparable minister, his</a>
<a id='line_171'>      only-begotten son, might claim, without presumption, the</a>
<a id='line_172'>      religious, though secondary, worship of a subject of a subject</a>

<a id='line_251'>      and, in their zeal for the divinity, they piously abjured the</a>

<a id='line_254'>      invented the phantastic system, which was afterwards propagated</a>
<a id='line_255'>      by the Marcionites, the Manichaeans, and the various names of the</a>
<a id='line_256'>      Gnostic heresy. 11 They denied the truth and authenticity of the</a>
<a id='line_257'>      Gospels, as far as they relate the conception of Mary, the birth</a>
<a id='line_258'>      of Christ, and the thirty years that preceded the exercise of his</a>
<a id='line_259'>      ministry. He first appeared on the banks of the Jordan in the</a>
<a id='line_260'>      form of perfect manhood; but it was a form only, and not a</a>
<a id='line_261'>      substance; a human figure created by the hand of Omnipotence to</a>
<a id='line_262'>      imitate the faculties and actions of a man, and to impose a</a>
<a id='line_263'>      perpetual illusion on the senses of his friends and enemies.</a>

<a id='line_267'>      not the corporeal, presence of the Son of God. The rage of the</a>

<a id='line_269'>      scenes of the passion and death, the resurrection and ascension,</a>
<a id='line_270'>      of Christ were represented on the theatre of Jerusalem for the</a>
<a id='line_271'>      benefit of mankind. If it were urged, that such ideal mimicry,</a>
<a id='line_272'>      such incessant deception, was unworthy of the God of truth, the</a>
<a id='line_273'>      Docetes agreed with too many of their orthodox brethren in the</a>

<a id='line_465'>      commentaries revealed the literal and allegorical sense of the</a>
<a id='line_466'>      Scriptures. A mystery, which had long floated in the looseness of</a>
<a id='line_467'>      popular belief, was defined by his perverse diligence in a</a>
<a id='line_468'>      technical form; and he first proclaimed the memorable words, “One</a>
<a id='line_469'>      incarnate nature of Christ,” which are still reechoed with</a>
<a id='line_470'>      hostile clamors in the churches of Asia, Egypt, and Aethiopia. He</a>
<a id='line_471'>      taught that the Godhead was united or mingled with the body of a</a>
<a id='line_472'>      man; and that the Logos, the eternal wisdom, supplied in the</a>

<a id='line_474'>      doctor had been terrified at his own rashness, Apollinaris was</a>
<a id='line_475'>      heard to mutter some faint accents of excuse and explanation. He</a>
<a id='line_476'>      acquiesced in the old distinction of the Greek philosophers</a>

<a id='line_480'></a>
<a id='line_481'>      With the moderate Docetes, he revered Mary as the spiritual,</a>

<a id='line_483'>      came from heaven, impassible and incorruptible, or was absorbed,</a>
<a id='line_484'>      and as it were transformed, into the essence of the Deity. The</a>

<a id='line_487'>      Basil, Gregory and Chrysostom, and tainted by those of Diodorus,</a>
<a id='line_488'>      Theodore, and Nestorius. But the person of the aged bishop of</a>

<a id='line_493'>      church. Her judgment at length inclined in their favor; the</a>
<a id='line_494'>      heresy of Apollinaris was condemned, and the separate</a>
<a id='line_495'>      congregations of his disciples were proscribed by the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_496'>      laws. But his principles were secretly entertained in the</a>
<a id='line_497'>      monasteries of Egypt, and his enemies felt the hatred of</a>

<a id='line_639'>      The prize was not unworthy of his ambition. At a distance from</a>
<a id='line_640'>      the court, and at the head of an immense capital, the patriarch,</a>
<a id='line_641'>      as he was now styled, of Alexandria had gradually usurped the</a>
<a id='line_642'>      state and authority of a civil magistrate. The public and private</a>
<a id='line_643'>      charities of the city were blindly obeyed by his numerous and</a>
<a id='line_644'>      fanatic parabolani, 24 familiarized in their daily office with</a>
<a id='line_645'>      scenes of death; and the praefects of Egypt were awed or provoked</a>
<a id='line_646'>      by the temporal power of these Christian pontiffs. Ardent in the</a>
<a id='line_647'>      prosecution of heresy, Cyril auspiciously opened his reign by</a>
<a id='line_648'>      oppressing the Novatians, the most innocent and harmless of the</a>
<a id='line_649'>      sectaries. The interdiction of their religious worship appeared</a>
<a id='line_650'>      in his eyes a just and meritorious act; and he confiscated their</a>
<a id='line_651'>      holy vessels, without apprehending the guilt of sacrilege. The</a>
<a id='line_652'>      toleration, and even the privileges of the Jews, who had</a>
<a id='line_653'>      multiplied to the number of forty thousand, were secured by the</a>
<a id='line_654'>      laws of the Caesars and Ptolemies, and a long prescription of</a>
<a id='line_655'>      seven hundred years since the foundation of Alexandria. Without</a>
<a id='line_656'>      any legal sentence, without any royal mandate, the patriarch, at</a>
<a id='line_657'>      the dawn of day, led a seditious multitude to the attack of the</a>
<a id='line_658'>      synagogues. Unarmed and unprepared, the Jews were incapable of</a>
<a id='line_659'>      resistance; their houses of prayer were levelled with the ground,</a>
<a id='line_660'>      and the episcopal warrior, after rewarding his troops with the</a>
<a id='line_661'>      plunder of their goods, expelled from the city the remnant of the</a>
<a id='line_662'>      unbelieving nation. Perhaps he might plead the insolence of their</a>
<a id='line_663'>      prosperity, and their deadly hatred of the Christians, whose</a>
<a id='line_664'>      blood they had recently shed in a malicious or accidental tumult.</a>
<a id='line_665'></a>
<a id='line_666'>      Such crimes would have deserved the animadversion of the</a>

<a id='line_668'>      confounded with the guilty, and Alexandria was impoverished by</a>
<a id='line_669'>      the loss of a wealthy and industrious colony. The zeal of Cyril</a>
<a id='line_670'>      exposed him to the penalties of the Julian law; but in a feeble</a>
<a id='line_671'>      government and a superstitious age, he was secure of impunity,</a>
<a id='line_672'>      and even of praise. Orestes complained; but his just complaints</a>
<a id='line_673'>      were too quickly forgotten by the ministers of Theodosius, and</a>
<a id='line_674'>      too deeply remembered by a priest who affected to pardon, and</a>
<a id='line_675'>      continued to hate, the praefect of Egypt. As he passed through</a>
<a id='line_676'>      the streets, his chariot was assaulted by a band of five hundred</a>
<a id='line_677'>      of the Nitrian monks; his guards fled from the wild beasts of the</a>
<a id='line_678'>      desert; his protestations that he was a Christian and a Catholic</a>
<a id='line_679'>      were answered by a volley of stones, and the face of Orestes was</a>
<a id='line_680'>      covered with blood. The loyal citizens of Alexandria hastened to</a>
<a id='line_681'>      his rescue; he instantly satisfied his justice and revenge</a>
<a id='line_682'>      against the monk by whose hand he had been wounded, and Ammonius</a>
<a id='line_683'>      expired under the rod of the lictor. At the command of Cyril his</a>
<a id='line_684'>      body was raised from the ground, and transported, in solemn</a>
<a id='line_685'>      procession, to the cathedral; the name of Ammonius was changed to</a>
<a id='line_686'>      that of Thaumasius the wonderful; his tomb was decorated with the</a>
<a id='line_687'>      trophies of martyrdom, and the patriarch ascended the pulpit to</a>
<a id='line_688'>      celebrate the magnanimity of an assassin and a rebel. Such honors</a>
<a id='line_689'>      might incite the faithful to combat and die under the banners of</a>
<a id='line_690'>      the saint; and he soon prompted, or accepted, the sacrifice of a</a>
<a id='line_691'>      virgin, who professed the religion of the Greeks, and cultivated</a>
<a id='line_692'>      the friendship of Orestes. Hypatia, the daughter of Theon the</a>
<a id='line_693'>      mathematician, 25 was initiated in her father’s studies; her</a>
<a id='line_694'>      learned comments have elucidated the geometry of Apollonius and</a>
<a id='line_695'>      Diophantus, and she publicly taught, both at Athens and</a>
<a id='line_696'>      Alexandria, the philosophy of Plato and Aristotle. In the bloom</a>
<a id='line_697'>      of beauty, and in the maturity of wisdom, the modest maid refused</a>
<a id='line_698'>      her lovers and instructed her disciples; the persons most</a>
<a id='line_699'>      illustrious for their rank or merit were impatient to visit the</a>

<a id='line_701'>      gorgeous train of horses and slaves who crowded the door of her</a>
<a id='line_702'>      academy. A rumor was spread among the Christians, that the</a>
<a id='line_703'>      daughter of Theon was the only obstacle to the reconciliation of</a>
<a id='line_704'>      the praefect and the archbishop; and that obstacle was speedily</a>

<a id='line_749'>      virgin, than the banishment of a saint; and Cyril had accompanied</a>
<a id='line_750'>      his uncle to the iniquitous synod of the Oak. When the memory of</a>
<a id='line_751'>      Chrysostom was restored and consecrated, the nephew of</a>
<a id='line_752'>      Theophilus, at the head of a dying faction, still maintained the</a>
<a id='line_753'>      justice of his sentence; nor was it till after a tedious delay</a>
<a id='line_754'>      and an obstinate resistance, that he yielded to the consent of</a>
<a id='line_755'>      the Catholic world. 28 His enmity to the Byzantine pontiffs 29</a>
<a id='line_756'>      was a sense of interest, not a sally of passion: he envied their</a>
<a id='line_757'>      fortunate station in the sunshine of the Imperial court; and he</a>
<a id='line_758'>      dreaded their upstart ambition. which oppressed the metropolitans</a>
<a id='line_759'>      of Europe and Asia, invaded the provinces of Antioch and</a>
<a id='line_760'>      Alexandria, and measured their diocese by the limits of the</a>
<a id='line_761'>      empire. The long moderation of Atticus, the mild usurper of the</a>
<a id='line_762'>      throne of Chrysostom, suspended the animosities of the Eastern</a>
<a id='line_763'>      patriarchs; but Cyril was at length awakened by the exaltation of</a>
<a id='line_764'>      a rival more worthy of his esteem and hatred. After the short and</a>
<a id='line_765'>      troubled reign of Sisinnius, bishop of Constantinople, the</a>
<a id='line_766'>      factions of the clergy and people were appeased by the choice of</a>
<a id='line_767'>      the emperor, who, on this occasion, consulted the voice of fame,</a>
<a id='line_768'>      and invited the merit of a stranger.</a>
<a id='line_769'></a>
<a id='line_770'>      Nestorius, 30 native of Germanicia, and a monk of Antioch, was</a>
<a id='line_771'>      recommended by the austerity of his life, and the eloquence of</a>
<a id='line_772'>      his sermons; but the first homily which he preached before the</a>
<a id='line_773'>      devout Theodosius betrayed the acrimony and impatience of his</a>
<a id='line_774'>      zeal. “Give me, O Caesar!” he exclaimed, “give me the earth</a>
<a id='line_775'>      purged of heretics, and I will give you in exchange the kingdom</a>
<a id='line_776'>      of heaven. Exterminate with me the heretics; and with you I will</a>
<a id='line_777'>      exterminate the Persians.” On the fifth day as if the treaty had</a>
<a id='line_778'>      been already signed, the patriarch of Constantinople discovered,</a>
<a id='line_779'>      surprised, and attacked a secret conventicle of the Arians: they</a>
<a id='line_780'>      preferred death to submission; the flames that were kindled by</a>
<a id='line_781'>      their despair, soon spread to the neighboring houses, and the</a>
<a id='line_782'>      triumph of Nestorius was clouded by the name of incendiary. On</a>
<a id='line_783'>      either side of the Hellespont his episcopal vigor imposed a rigid</a>
<a id='line_784'>      formulary of faith and discipline; a chronological error</a>
<a id='line_785'>      concerning the festival of Easter was punished as an offence</a>
<a id='line_786'>      against the church and state. Lydia and Caria, Sardes and</a>
<a id='line_787'>      Miletus, were purified with the blood of the obstinate</a>
<a id='line_788'>      Quartodecimans; and the edict of the emperor, or rather of the</a>
<a id='line_789'>      patriarch, enumerates three-and-twenty degrees and denominations</a>
<a id='line_790'>      in the guilt and punishment of heresy. 31 But the sword of</a>
<a id='line_791'>      persecution which Nestorius so furiously wielded was soon turned</a>
<a id='line_792'>      against his own breast. Religion was the pretence; but, in the</a>
<a id='line_793'>      judgment of a contemporary saint, ambition was the genuine motive</a>

<a id='line_846'>      absurd, might claim the protection of the monks; and the people</a>
<a id='line_847'>      were interested in the glory of their virgin patroness. 38 The</a>
<a id='line_848'>      sermons of the archbishop, and the service of the altar, were</a>

<a id='line_852'>      combatants on a sonorous theatre reechoed in the cells of</a>
<a id='line_853'>      Palestine and Egypt. It was the duty of Cyril to enlighten the</a>
<a id='line_854'>      zeal and ignorance of his innumerable monks: in the school of</a>
<a id='line_855'>      Alexandria, he had imbibed and professed the incarnation of one</a>
<a id='line_856'>      nature; and the successor of Athanasius consulted his pride and</a>
<a id='line_857'>      ambition, when he rose in arms against another Arius, more</a>
<a id='line_858'>      formidable and more guilty, on the second throne of the</a>
<a id='line_859'>      hierarchy. After a short correspondence, in which the rival</a>
<a id='line_860'>      prelates disguised their hatred in the hollow language of respect</a>
<a id='line_861'>      and charity, the patriarch of Alexandria denounced to the prince</a>
<a id='line_862'>      and people, to the East and to the West, the damnable errors of</a>
<a id='line_863'>      the Byzantine pontiff. From the East, more especially from</a>
<a id='line_864'>      Antioch, he obtained the ambiguous counsels of toleration and</a>
<a id='line_865'>      silence, which were addressed to both parties while they favored</a>
<a id='line_866'>      the cause of Nestorius. But the Vatican received with open arms</a>
<a id='line_867'>      the messengers of Egypt. The vanity of Celestine was flattered by</a>
<a id='line_868'>      the appeal; and the partial version of a monk decided the faith</a>
<a id='line_869'>      of the pope, who with his Latin clergy was ignorant of the</a>
<a id='line_870'>      language, the arts, and the theology of the Greeks. At the head</a>
<a id='line_871'>      of an Italian synod, Celestine weighed the merits of the cause,</a>
<a id='line_872'>      approved the creed of Cyril, condemned the sentiments and person</a>
<a id='line_873'>      of Nestorius, degraded the heretic from his episcopal dignity,</a>

<a id='line_958'>      least to the meaning, of the royal summons, he was attended by</a>
<a id='line_959'>      fifty Egyptian bishops, who expected from their patriarch’s nod</a>
<a id='line_960'>      the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. He had contracted an intimate</a>
<a id='line_961'>      alliance with Memnon, bishop of Ephesus. The despotic primate of</a>
<a id='line_962'>      Asia disposed of the ready succors of thirty or forty episcopal</a>
<a id='line_963'>      votes: a crowd of peasants, the slaves of the church, was poured</a>
<a id='line_964'>      into the city to support with blows and clamors a metaphysical</a>
<a id='line_965'>      argument; and the people zealously asserted the honor of the</a>
<a id='line_966'>      Virgin, whose body reposed within the walls of Ephesus. 42 The</a>
<a id='line_967'>      fleet which had transported Cyril from Alexandria was laden with</a>
<a id='line_968'>      the riches of Egypt; and he disembarked a numerous body of</a>
<a id='line_969'>      mariners, slaves, and fanatics, enlisted with blind obedience</a>
<a id='line_970'>      under the banner of St. Mark and the mother of God. The fathers,</a>
<a id='line_971'>      and even the guards, of the council were awed by this martial</a>
<a id='line_972'>      array; the adversaries of Cyril and Mary were insulted in the</a>
<a id='line_973'>      streets, or threatened in their houses; his eloquence and</a>
<a id='line_974'>      liberality made a daily increase in the number of his adherents;</a>
<a id='line_975'>      and the Egyptian soon computed that he might command the</a>
<a id='line_976'>      attendance and the voices of two hundred bishops. 43 But the</a>
<a id='line_977'>      author of the twelve anathemas foresaw and dreaded the opposition</a>
<a id='line_978'>      of John of Antioch, who, with a small, but respectable, train of</a>
<a id='line_979'>      metropolitans and divines, was advancing by slow journeys from</a>
<a id='line_980'>      the distant capital of the East. Impatient of a delay, which he</a>
<a id='line_981'>      stigmatized as voluntary and culpable, 44 Cyril announced the</a>
<a id='line_982'>      opening of the synod sixteen days after the festival of</a>
<a id='line_983'>      Pentecost. Nestorius, who depended on the near approach of his</a>
<a id='line_984'>      Eastern friends, persisted, like his predecessor Chrysostom, to</a>
<a id='line_985'>      disclaim the jurisdiction, and to disobey the summons, of his</a>
<a id='line_986'>      enemies: they hastened his trial, and his accuser presided in the</a>
<a id='line_987'>      seat of judgment. Sixty-eight bishops, twenty-two of metropolitan</a>
<a id='line_988'>      rank, defended his cause by a modest and temperate protest: they</a>
<a id='line_989'>      were excluded from the councils of their brethren. Candidian, in</a>
<a id='line_990'>      the emperor’s name, requested a delay of four days; the profane</a>
<a id='line_991'>      magistrate was driven with outrage and insult from the assembly</a>

<a id='line_1131'>      were sanctified with frequent monasteries, and the holy abbots,</a>
<a id='line_1132'>      Dalmatius and Eutyches, 49 had devoted their zeal and fidelity to</a>

<a id='line_1139'>      tapers in their hands, and chanted litanies to the mother of God,</a>
<a id='line_1140'>      they proceeded from their monasteries to the palace. The people</a>
<a id='line_1141'>      was edified and inflamed by this extraordinary spectacle, and the</a>
<a id='line_1142'>      trembling monarch listened to the prayers and adjurations of the</a>
<a id='line_1143'>      saints, who boldly pronounced, that none could hope for</a>
<a id='line_1144'>      salvation, unless they embraced the person and the creed of the</a>
<a id='line_1145'>      orthodox successor of Athanasius. At the same time, every avenue</a>
<a id='line_1146'>      of the throne was assaulted with gold. Under the decent names of</a>
<a id='line_1147'>      eulogies and benedictions, the courtiers of both sexes were</a>
<a id='line_1148'>      bribed according to the measure of their power and rapaciousness.</a>

<a id='line_1320'>      surprised into a seeming confession, that Christ had not derived</a>
<a id='line_1321'>      his body from the substance of the Virgin Mary. From their</a>

<a id='line_1329'>      dioceses of the Eastern empire: some exceptions of favor or merit</a>

<a id='line_1337'>      more formidable monks, whose minds were inaccessible to reason or</a>

<a id='line_1339'>      it should seem, the unconstrained voice of the fathers, accepted</a>
<a id='line_1340'>      the faith and even the anathemas of Cyril; and the heresy of the</a>
<a id='line_1341'>      two natures was formally condemned in the persons and writings of</a>
<a id='line_1342'>      the most learned Orientals. “May those who divide Christ be</a>
<a id='line_1343'>      divided with the sword, may they be hewn in pieces, may they be</a>

<a id='line_1349'>      the knees of Dioscorus, as he stood with a threatening aspect on</a>
<a id='line_1350'>      the footstool of his throne, and conjured him to forgive the</a>

<a id='line_1457'>      yielded, they should be massacred, on their return to Egypt, by</a>
<a id='line_1458'>      the indignant people. A tardy repentance was allowed to expiate</a>

<a id='line_1745'>      had been imagined by a Monophysite bishop; 77 the gift of an</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      enemy was at first rejected as a dire and dangerous blasphemy,</a>

<a id='line_1757'>      this momentous quarrel. The streets were instantly crowded with</a>
<a id='line_1758'>      innumerable swarms of men, women, and children; the legions of</a>

<a id='line_1763'>      galleys of Anastasius lay upon their oars before the palace, till</a>
<a id='line_1764'>      the patriarch had pardoned his penitent, and hushed the waves of</a>

<a id='line_1787'>      admonition, that, since all could not reign, they should</a>

<a id='line_1950'>      alone was resolved to live and to die like his ancestors: he</a>
<a id='line_1951'>      enfranchised himself with the stroke of a dagger, and left his</a>

<a id='line_1954'>      their earthly monarch, underwent the ceremony of baptism, and</a>
<a id='line_1955'>      labored, by their extraordinary zeal, to erase the suspicion, or</a>
<a id='line_1956'>      to expiate the guilt, of idolatry. The native country of Homer,</a>
<a id='line_1957'>      and the theatre of the Trojan war, still retained the last sparks</a>
<a id='line_1958'>      of his mythology: by the care of the same bishop, seventy</a>
<a id='line_1959'>      thousand Pagans were detected and converted in Asia, Phrygia,</a>
<a id='line_1960'>      Lydia, and Caria; ninety-six churches were built for the new</a>
<a id='line_1961'>      proselytes; and linen vestments, Bibles, and liturgies, and vases</a>
<a id='line_1962'>      of gold and silver, were supplied by the pious munificence of</a>
<a id='line_1963'>      Justinian. 86 The Jews, who had been gradually stripped of their</a>
<a id='line_1964'>      immunities, were oppressed by a vexatious law, which compelled</a>
<a id='line_1965'>      them to observe the festival of Easter the same day on which it</a>
<a id='line_1966'>      was celebrated by the Christians. 87 And they might complain with</a>
<a id='line_1967'>      the more reason, since the Catholics themselves did not agree</a>
<a id='line_1968'>      with the astronomical calculations of their sovereign: the people</a>
<a id='line_1969'>      of Constantinople delayed the beginning of their Lent a whole</a>
<a id='line_1970'>      week after it had been ordained by authority; and they had the</a>
<a id='line_1971'>      pleasure of fasting seven days, while meat was exposed for sale</a>
<a id='line_1972'>      by the command of the emperor. The Samaritans of Palestine 88</a>
<a id='line_1973'>      were a motley race, an ambiguous sect, rejected as Jews by the</a>
<a id='line_1974'>      Pagans, by the Jews as schismatics, and by the Christians as</a>
<a id='line_1975'>      idolaters. The abomination of the cross had already been planted</a>
<a id='line_1976'>      on their holy mount of Garizim, 89 but the persecution of</a>
<a id='line_1977'>      Justinian offered only the alternative of baptism or rebellion.</a>
<a id='line_1978'>      They chose the latter: under the standard of a desperate leader,</a>
<a id='line_1979'>      they rose in arms, and retaliated their wrongs on the lives, the</a>

<a id='line_1981'>      Samaritans were finally subdued by the regular forces of the</a>

<a id='line_2062'>      lines, is deeply marked with this subtile and disingenuous</a>
<a id='line_2063'>      spirit. It was now three hundred years since the body of Origen</a>
<a id='line_2064'>      95 had been eaten by the worms: his soul, of which he held the</a>
<a id='line_2065'>      preexistence, was in the hands of its Creator; but his writings</a>
<a id='line_2066'>      were eagerly perused by the monks of Palestine. In these</a>
<a id='line_2067'>      writings, the piercing eye of Justinian descried more than ten</a>
<a id='line_2068'>      metaphysical errors; and the primitive doctor, in the company of</a>
<a id='line_2069'>      Pythagoras and Plato, was devoted by the clergy to the eternity</a>
<a id='line_2070'>      of hell-fire, which he had presumed to deny. Under the cover of</a>
<a id='line_2071'>      this precedent, a treacherous blow was aimed at the council of</a>
<a id='line_2072'>      Chalcedon. The fathers had listened without impatience to the</a>
<a id='line_2073'>      praise of Theodore of Mopsuestia; 96 and their justice or</a>
<a id='line_2074'>      indulgence had restored both Theodore of Cyrrhus, and Ibas of</a>
<a id='line_2075'>      Edessa, to the communion of the church. But the characters of</a>
<a id='line_2076'>      these Oriental bishops were tainted with the reproach of heresy;</a>
<a id='line_2077'>      the first had been the master, the two others were the friends,</a>
<a id='line_2078'>      of Nestorius; their most suspicious passages were accused under</a>
<a id='line_2079'>      the title of the three chapters; and the condemnation of their</a>
<a id='line_2080'>      memory must involve the honor of a synod, whose name was</a>
<a id='line_2081'>      pronounced with sincere or affected reverence by the Catholic</a>
<a id='line_2082'>      world. If these bishops, whether innocent or guilty, were</a>
<a id='line_2083'>      annihilated in the sleep of death, they would not probably be</a>
<a id='line_2084'>      awakened by the clamor which, after a hundred years, was raised</a>
<a id='line_2085'>      over their grave. If they were already in the fangs of the</a>
<a id='line_2086'>      daemon, their torments could neither be aggravated nor assuaged</a>
<a id='line_2087'>      by human industry. If in the company of saints and angels they</a>
<a id='line_2088'>      enjoyed the rewards of piety, they must have smiled at the idle</a>
<a id='line_2089'>      fury of the theological insects who still crawled on the surface</a>
<a id='line_2090'>      of the earth. The foremost of these insects, the emperor of the</a>
<a id='line_2091'>      Romans, darted his sting, and distilled his venom, perhaps</a>
<a id='line_2092'>      without discerning the true motives of Theodora and her</a>
<a id='line_2093'>      ecclesiastical faction. The victims were no longer subject to his</a>
<a id='line_2094'>      power, and the vehement style of his edicts could only proclaim</a>
<a id='line_2095'>      their damnation, and invite the clergy of the East to join in a</a>
<a id='line_2096'>      full chorus of curses and anathemas. The East, with some</a>
<a id='line_2097'>      hesitation, consented to the voice of her sovereign: the fifth</a>
<a id='line_2098'>      general council, of three patriarchs and one hundred and</a>
<a id='line_2099'>      sixty-five bishops, was held at Constantinople; and the authors,</a>
<a id='line_2100'>      as well as the defenders, of the three chapters were separated</a>
<a id='line_2101'>      from the communion of the saints, and solemnly delivered to the</a>
<a id='line_2102'>      prince of darkness. But the Latin churches were more jealous of</a>
<a id='line_2103'>      the honor of Leo and the synod of Chalcedon: and if they had</a>
<a id='line_2104'>      fought as they usually did under the standard of Rome, they might</a>
<a id='line_2105'>      have prevailed in the cause of reason and humanity. But their</a>
<a id='line_2106'>      chief was a prisoner in the hands of the enemy; the throne of St.</a>
<a id='line_2107'>      Peter, which had been disgraced by the simony, was betrayed by</a>
<a id='line_2108'>      the cowardice, of Vigilius, who yielded, after a long and</a>
<a id='line_2109'>      inconsistent struggle, to the despotism of Justinian and the</a>
<a id='line_2110'>      sophistry of the Greeks. His apostasy provoked the indignation of</a>
<a id='line_2111'>      the Latins, and no more than two bishops could be found who would</a>
<a id='line_2112'>      impose their hands on his deacon and successor Pelagius. Yet the</a>
<a id='line_2113'>      perseverance of the popes insensibly transferred to their</a>

<a id='line_2226'>      single or a double will. They replied in the singular, and the</a>

<a id='line_2228'>      Syria might be reconciled by the profession of a doctrine, most</a>
<a id='line_2229'>      certainly harmless, and most probably true, since it was taught</a>
<a id='line_2230'>      even by the Nestorians themselves. 101 The experiment was tried</a>

<a id='line_2235'>      nature of Christ they speciously applied a proper and distinct</a>

<a id='line_2237'>      allowed that the human and the divine will were invariably the</a>
<a id='line_2238'>      same. 102 The disease was attended with the customary symptoms:</a>
<a id='line_2239'>      but the Greek clergy, as if satiated with the endless controversy</a>
<a id='line_2240'>      of the incarnation, instilled a healing counsel into the ear of</a>
<a id='line_2241'>      the prince and people. They declared themselves Monothelites,</a>
<a id='line_2242'>      (asserters of the unity of will,) but they treated the words as</a>
<a id='line_2243'>      new, the questions as superfluous; and recommended a religious</a>
<a id='line_2244'>      silence as the most agreeable to the prudence and charity of the</a>
<a id='line_2245'>      gospel. This law of silence was successively imposed by the</a>
<a id='line_2246'>      ecthesis or exposition of Heraclius, the type or model of his</a>
<a id='line_2247'>      grandson Constans; 103 and the Imperial edicts were subscribed</a>

<a id='line_2249'>      Constantinople, Alexandria, and Antioch. But the bishop and monks</a>
<a id='line_2250'>      of Jerusalem sounded the alarm: in the language, or even in the</a>
<a id='line_2251'>      silence, of the Greeks, the Latin churches detected a latent</a>
<a id='line_2252'>      heresy: and the obedience of Pope Honorius to the commands of his</a>
<a id='line_2253'>      sovereign was retracted and censured by the bolder ignorance of</a>
<a id='line_2254'>      his successors. They condemned the execrable and abominable</a>
<a id='line_2255'>      heresy of the Monothelites, who revived the errors of Manes,</a>
<a id='line_2256'>      Apollinaris, Eutyches, &c.; they signed the sentence of</a>
<a id='line_2257'>      excommunication on the tomb of St. Peter; the ink was mingled</a>
<a id='line_2258'>      with the sacramental wine, the blood of Christ; and no ceremony</a>
<a id='line_2259'>      was omitted that could fill the superstitious mind with horror</a>
<a id='line_2260'>      and affright. As the representative of the Western church, Pope</a>
<a id='line_2261'>      Martin and his Lateran synod anathematized the perfidious and</a>
<a id='line_2262'>      guilty silence of the Greeks: one hundred and five bishops of</a>
<a id='line_2263'>      Italy, for the most part the subjects of Constans, presumed to</a>
<a id='line_2264'>      reprobate his wicked type, and the impious ecthesis of his</a>
<a id='line_2265'>      grandfather; and to confound the authors and their adherents with</a>
<a id='line_2266'>      the twenty-one notorious heretics, the apostates from the church,</a>
<a id='line_2267'>      and the organs of the devil. Such an insult under the tamest</a>
<a id='line_2268'>      reign could not pass with impunity. Pope Martin ended his days on</a>
<a id='line_2269'>      the inhospitable shore of the Tauric Chersonesus, and his oracle,</a>
<a id='line_2270'>      the abbot Maximus, was inhumanly chastised by the amputation of</a>
<a id='line_2271'>      his tongue and his right hand. 104 But the same invincible spirit</a>
<a id='line_2272'>      survived in their successors; and the triumph of the Latins</a>
<a id='line_2273'>      avenged their recent defeat, and obliterated the disgrace of the</a>
<a id='line_2274'>      three chapters. The synods of Rome were confirmed by the sixth</a>
<a id='line_2275'>      general council of Constantinople, in the palace and the presence</a>
<a id='line_2276'>      of a new Constantine, a descendant of Heraclius. The royal</a>
<a id='line_2277'>      convert converted the Byzantine pontiff and a majority of the</a>
<a id='line_2278'>      bishops; 105 the dissenters, with their chief, Macarius of</a>
<a id='line_2279'>      Antioch, were condemned to the spiritual and temporal pains of</a>
<a id='line_2280'>      heresy; the East condescended to accept the lessons of the West;</a>
<a id='line_2281'>      and the creed was finally settled, which teaches the Catholics of</a>
<a id='line_2282'>      every age, that two wills or energies are harmonized in the</a>
<a id='line_2283'>      person of Christ. The majesty of the pope and the Roman synod was</a>
<a id='line_2284'>      represented by two priests, one deacon, and three bishops; but</a>
<a id='line_2285'>      these obscure Latins had neither arms to compel, nor treasures to</a>
<a id='line_2286'>      bribe, nor language to persuade; and I am ignorant by what arts</a>
<a id='line_2287'>      they could determine the lofty emperor of the Greeks to abjure</a>
<a id='line_2288'>      the catechism of his infancy, and to persecute the religion of</a>
<a id='line_2289'>      his fathers. Perhaps the monks and people of Constantinople 106</a>
<a id='line_2290'>      were favorable to the Lateran creed, which is indeed the least</a>
<a id='line_2291'>      reasonable of the two: and the suspicion is countenanced by the</a>
<a id='line_2292'>      unnatural moderation of the Greek clergy, who appear in this</a>
<a id='line_2293'>      quarrel to be conscious of their weakness. While the synod</a>
<a id='line_2294'>      debated, a fanatic proposed a more summary decision, by raising a</a>
<a id='line_2295'>      dead man to life: the prelates assisted at the trial; but the</a>

<a id='line_2297'>      prejudices of the multitude were not enlisted on the side of the</a>
<a id='line_2298'>      Monothelites. In the next generation, when the son of Constantine</a>
<a id='line_2299'>      was deposed and slain by the disciple of Macarius, they tasted</a>
<a id='line_2300'>      the feast of revenge and dominion: the image or monument of the</a>
<a id='line_2301'>      sixth council was defaced, and the original acts were committed</a>

<a id='line_2387'>      language doubtless the most perfect that has been contrived by</a>
<a id='line_2388'>      the art of man. Yet the body of the people, both in Syria and</a>
<a id='line_2389'>      Egypt, still persevered in the use of their national idioms; with</a>
<a id='line_2390'>      this difference, however, that the Coptic was confined to the</a>

<a id='line_2392'>      from the mountains of Assyria to the Red Sea, was adapted to the</a>
<a id='line_2393'>      higher topics of poetry and argument. Armenia and Abyssinia were</a>
<a id='line_2394'>      infected by the speech or learning of the Greeks; and their</a>
<a id='line_2395'>      Barbaric tongues, which have been revived in the studies of</a>
<a id='line_2396'>      modern Europe, were unintelligible to the inhabitants of the</a>
<a id='line_2397'>      Roman empire. The Syriac and the Coptic, the Armenian and the</a>
<a id='line_2398'>      Aethiopic, are consecrated in the service of their respective</a>
<a id='line_2399'>      churches: and their theology is enriched by domestic versions 111</a>
<a id='line_2400'>      both of the Scriptures and of the most popular fathers. After a</a>
<a id='line_2401'>      period of thirteen hundred and sixty years, the spark of</a>
<a id='line_2402'>      controversy, first kindled by a sermon of Nestorius, still burns</a>
<a id='line_2403'>      in the bosom of the East, and the hostile communions still</a>
<a id='line_2404'>      maintain the faith and discipline of their founders. In the most</a>
<a id='line_2405'>      abject state of ignorance, poverty, and servitude, the Nestorians</a>
<a id='line_2406'>      and Monophysites reject the spiritual supremacy of Rome, and</a>
<a id='line_2407'>      cherish the toleration of their Turkish masters, which allows</a>
<a id='line_2408'>      them to anathematize, on the one hand, St. Cyril and the synod of</a>
<a id='line_2409'>      Ephesus: on the other, Pope Leo and the council of Chalcedon. The</a>
<a id='line_2410'>      weight which they cast into the downfall of the Eastern empire</a>

<a id='line_2507'>      Christianity had struck a deep root, and the nations of the East</a>
<a id='line_2508'>      reposed under its salutary shade. The catholic, or primate,</a>
<a id='line_2509'>      resided in the capital: in his synods, and in their dioceses, his</a>
<a id='line_2510'>      metropolitans, bishops, and clergy, represented the pomp and</a>
<a id='line_2511'>      order of a regular hierarchy: they rejoiced in the increase of</a>
<a id='line_2512'>      proselytes, who were converted from the Zendavesta to the gospel,</a>
<a id='line_2513'>      from the secular to the monastic life; and their zeal was</a>
<a id='line_2514'>      stimulated by the presence of an artful and formidable enemy. The</a>
<a id='line_2515'>      Persian church had been founded by the missionaries of Syria; and</a>
<a id='line_2516'>      their language, discipline, and doctrine, were closely interwoven</a>
<a id='line_2517'>      with its original frame. The catholics were elected and ordained</a>
<a id='line_2518'>      by their own suffragans; but their filial dependence on the</a>

<a id='line_2521'>      generations of the faithful imbibed their theological idiom: they</a>
<a id='line_2522'>      studied in the Syriac version the ten thousand volumes of</a>
<a id='line_2523'>      Theodore of Mopsuestia; and they revered the apostolic faith and</a>
<a id='line_2524'>      holy martyrdom of his disciple Nestorius, whose person and</a>
<a id='line_2525'>      language were equally unknown to the nations beyond the Tigris.</a>
<a id='line_2526'>      The first indelible lesson of Ibas, bishop of Edessa, taught them</a>
<a id='line_2527'>      to execrate the Egyptians, who, in the synod of Ephesus, had</a>
<a id='line_2528'>      impiously confounded the two natures of Christ. The flight of the</a>
<a id='line_2529'>      masters and scholars, who were twice expelled from the Athens of</a>
<a id='line_2530'>      Syria, dispersed a crowd of missionaries inflamed by the double</a>
<a id='line_2531'>      zeal of religion and revenge. And the rigid unity of the</a>
<a id='line_2532'>      Monophysites, who, under the reigns of Zeno and Anastasius, had</a>
<a id='line_2533'>      invaded the thrones of the East, provoked their antagonists, in a</a>
<a id='line_2534'>      land of freedom, to avow a moral, rather than a physical, union</a>
<a id='line_2535'>      of the two persons of Christ. Since the first preaching of the</a>
<a id='line_2536'>      gospel, the Sassanian kings beheld with an eye of suspicion a</a>
<a id='line_2537'>      race of aliens and apostates, who had embraced the religion, and</a>
<a id='line_2538'>      who might favor the cause, of the hereditary foes of their</a>
<a id='line_2539'>      country. The royal edicts had often prohibited their dangerous</a>
<a id='line_2540'>      correspondence with the Syrian clergy: the progress of the schism</a>
<a id='line_2541'>      was grateful to the jealous pride of Perozes, and he listened to</a>
<a id='line_2542'>      the eloquence of an artful prelate, who painted Nestorius as the</a>
<a id='line_2543'>      friend of Persia, and urged him to secure the fidelity of his</a>
<a id='line_2544'>      Christian subjects, by granting a just preference to the victims</a>
<a id='line_2545'>      and enemies of the Roman tyrant. The Nestorians composed a large</a>
<a id='line_2546'>      majority of the clergy and people: they were encouraged by the</a>
<a id='line_2547'>      smile, and armed with the sword, of despotism; yet many of their</a>
<a id='line_2548'>      weaker brethren were startled at the thought of breaking loose</a>
<a id='line_2549'>      from the communion of the Christian world, and the blood of seven</a>
<a id='line_2550'>      thousand seven hundred Monophysites, or Catholics, confirmed the</a>
<a id='line_2551'>      uniformity of faith and discipline in the churches of Persia. 115</a>
<a id='line_2552'>      Their ecclesiastical institutions are distinguished by a liberal</a>
<a id='line_2553'>      principle of reason, or at least of policy: the austerity of the</a>
<a id='line_2554'>      cloister was relaxed and gradually forgotten; houses of charity</a>
<a id='line_2555'>      were endowed for the education of orphans and foundlings; the law</a>
<a id='line_2556'>      of celibacy, so forcibly recommended to the Greeks and Latins,</a>
<a id='line_2557'>      was disregarded by the Persian clergy; and the number of the</a>
<a id='line_2558'>      elect was multiplied by the public and reiterated nuptials of the</a>
<a id='line_2559'>      priests, the bishops, and even the patriarch himself. To this</a>
<a id='line_2560'>      standard of natural and religious freedom, myriads of fugitives</a>
<a id='line_2561'>      resorted from all the provinces of the Eastern empire; the narrow</a>
<a id='line_2562'>      bigotry of Justinian was punished by the emigration of his most</a>
<a id='line_2563'>      industrious subjects; they transported into Persia the arts both</a>
<a id='line_2564'>      of peace and war: and those who deserved the favor, were promoted</a>
<a id='line_2565'>      in the service, of a discerning monarch. The arms of Nushirvan,</a>
<a id='line_2566'>      and his fiercer grandson, were assisted with advice, and money,</a>
<a id='line_2567'>      and troops, by the desperate sectaries who still lurked in their</a>
<a id='line_2568'>      native cities of the East: their zeal was rewarded with the gift</a>
<a id='line_2569'>      of the Catholic churches; but when those cities and churches were</a>
<a id='line_2570'>      recovered by Heraclius, their open profession of treason and</a>
<a id='line_2571'>      heresy compelled them to seek a refuge in the realm of their</a>
<a id='line_2572'>      foreign ally. But the seeming tranquillity of the Nestorians was</a>
<a id='line_2573'>      often endangered, and sometimes overthrown. They were involved in</a>
<a id='line_2574'>      the common evils of Oriental despotism: their enmity to Rome</a>
<a id='line_2575'>      could not always atone for their attachment to the gospel: and a</a>
<a id='line_2576'>      colony of three hundred thousand Jacobites, the captives of</a>
<a id='line_2577'>      Apamea and Antioch, was permitted to erect a hostile altar in the</a>
<a id='line_2578'>      face of the catholic, and in the sunshine of the court. In his</a>
<a id='line_2579'>      last treaty, Justinian introduced some conditions which tended to</a>
<a id='line_2580'>      enlarge and fortify the toleration of Christianity in Persia. The</a>
<a id='line_2581'>      emperor, ignorant of the rights of conscience, was incapable of</a>
<a id='line_2582'>      pity or esteem for the heretics who denied the authority of the</a>
<a id='line_2583'>      holy synods: but he flattered himself that they would gradually</a>
<a id='line_2584'>      perceive the temporal benefits of union with the empire and the</a>
<a id='line_2585'>      church of Rome; and if he failed in exciting their gratitude, he</a>
<a id='line_2586'>      might hope to provoke the jealousy of their sovereign. In a later</a>
<a id='line_2587'>      age the Lutherans have been burnt at Paris, and protected in</a>

<a id='line_2636'>      zeal of the Nestorians overleaped the limits which had confined</a>
<a id='line_2637'>      the ambition and curiosity both of the Greeks and Persians. The</a>
<a id='line_2638'>      missionaries of Balch and Samarcand pursued without fear the</a>

<a id='line_2645'>      ordination; and the fame of Prester or Presbyter John 117 has</a>
<a id='line_2646'>      long amused the credulity of Europe. The royal convert was</a>

<a id='line_2649'>      he should abstain from animal food, and how he might celebrate</a>
<a id='line_2650'>      the Eucharist in a desert that produced neither corn nor wine. In</a>
<a id='line_2651'>      their progress by sea and land, the Nestorians entered China by</a>

<a id='line_2900'>      Anastasius replanted the orthodox standard in the East; Severus</a>
<a id='line_2901'>      fled into Egypt; and his friend, the eloquent Xenaias, 127 who</a>
<a id='line_2902'>      had escaped from the Nestorians of Persia, was suffocated in his</a>
<a id='line_2903'>      exile by the Melchites of Paphlagonia. Fifty-four bishops were</a>
<a id='line_2904'>      swept from their thrones, eight hundred ecclesiastics were cast</a>
<a id='line_2905'>      into prison, 128 and notwithstanding the ambiguous favor of</a>
<a id='line_2906'>      Theodora, the Oriental flocks, deprived of their shepherds, must</a>

<a id='line_2909'>      and perpetuated, by the labors of a monk; and the name of James</a>
<a id='line_2910'>      Baradaeus 129 has been preserved in the appellation of Jacobites,</a>

<a id='line_2912'>      From the holy confessors in their prison of Constantinople, he</a>
<a id='line_2913'>      received the powers of bishop of Edessa and apostle of the East,</a>
<a id='line_2914'>      and the ordination of fourscore thousand bishops, priests, and</a>
<a id='line_2915'>      deacons, is derived from the same inexhaustible source. The speed</a>
<a id='line_2916'>      of the zealous missionary was promoted by the fleetest</a>
<a id='line_2917'>      dromedaries of a devout chief of the Arabs; the doctrine and</a>
<a id='line_2918'>      discipline of the Jacobites were secretly established in the</a>
<a id='line_2919'>      dominions of Justinian; and each Jacobite was compelled to</a>
<a id='line_2920'>      violate the laws and to hate the Roman legislator. The successors</a>
<a id='line_2921'>      of Severus, while they lurked in convents or villages, while they</a>
<a id='line_2922'>      sheltered their proscribed heads in the caverns of hermits, or</a>

<a id='line_2924'>      their indefeasible right to the title, the rank, and the</a>
<a id='line_2925'>      prerogatives of patriarch of Antioch: under the milder yoke of</a>
<a id='line_2926'>      the infidels, they reside about a league from Merdin, in the</a>
<a id='line_2927'>      pleasant monastery of Zapharan, which they have embellished with</a>
<a id='line_2928'>      cells, aqueducts, and plantations. The secondary, though</a>
<a id='line_2929'>      honorable, place is filled by the maphrian, who, in his station</a>
<a id='line_2930'>      at Mosul itself, defies the Nestorian catholic with whom he</a>
<a id='line_2931'>      contests the primacy of the East. Under the patriarch and the</a>
<a id='line_2932'>      maphrian, one hundred and fifty archbishops and bishops have been</a>
<a id='line_2933'>      counted in the different ages of the Jacobite church; but the</a>
<a id='line_2934'>      order of the hierarchy is relaxed or dissolved, and the greater</a>
<a id='line_2935'>      part of their dioceses is confined to the neighborhood of the</a>
<a id='line_2936'>      Euphrates and the Tigris. The cities of Aleppo and Amida, which</a>
<a id='line_2937'>      are often visited by the patriarch, contain some wealthy</a>
<a id='line_2938'>      merchants and industrious mechanics, but the multitude derive</a>
<a id='line_2939'>      their scanty sustenance from their daily labor: and poverty, as</a>
<a id='line_2940'>      well as superstition, may impose their excessive fasts: five</a>
<a id='line_2941'>      annual lents, during which both the clergy and laity abstain not</a>
<a id='line_2942'>      only from flesh or eggs, but even from the taste of wine, of oil,</a>
<a id='line_2943'>      and of fish. Their present numbers are esteemed from fifty to</a>
<a id='line_2944'>      fourscore thousand souls, the remnant of a populous church, which</a>
<a id='line_2945'>      was gradually decreased under the impression of twelve centuries.</a>
<a id='line_2946'>      Yet in that long period, some strangers of merit have been</a>
<a id='line_2947'>      converted to the Monophysite faith, and a Jew was the father of</a>
<a id='line_2948'>      Abulpharagius, 130 primate of the East, so truly eminent both in</a>
<a id='line_2949'>      his life and death. In his life he was an elegant writer of the</a>
<a id='line_2950'>      Syriac and Arabic tongues, a poet, physician, and historian, a</a>
<a id='line_2951'>      subtile philosopher, and a moderate divine. In his death, his</a>
<a id='line_2952'>      funeral was attended by his rival the Nestorian patriarch, with a</a>
<a id='line_2953'>      train of Greeks and Armenians, who forgot their disputes, and</a>
<a id='line_2954'>      mingled their tears over the grave of an enemy. The sect which</a>
<a id='line_2955'>      was honored by the virtues of Abulpharagius appears, however, to</a>
<a id='line_2956'>      sink below the level of their Nestorian brethren. The</a>
<a id='line_2957'>      superstition of the Jacobites is more abject, their fasts more</a>
<a id='line_2958'>      rigid, 131 their intestine divisions are more numerous, and their</a>
<a id='line_2959'>      doctors (as far as I can measure the degrees of nonsense) are</a>

<a id='line_2961'>      be allowed for the rigor of the Monophysite theology; much more</a>

<a id='line_3145'>      signalized their attachment to the religion and empire of the</a>
<a id='line_3146'>      Christians. 1391 The disorders of their country, and their</a>
<a id='line_3147'>      ignorance of the Greek tongue, prevented their clergy from</a>
<a id='line_3148'>      assisting at the synod of Chalcedon, and they floated eighty-four</a>
<a id='line_3149'>      years 140 in a state of indifference or suspense, till their</a>
<a id='line_3150'>      vacant faith was finally occupied by the missionaries of Julian</a>
<a id='line_3151'>      of Halicarnassus, 141 who in Egypt, their common exile, had been</a>
<a id='line_3152'>      vanquished by the arguments or the influence of his rival</a>
<a id='line_3153'>      Severus, the Monophysite patriarch of Antioch. The Armenians</a>
<a id='line_3154'>      alone are the pure disciples of Eutyches, an unfortunate parent,</a>
<a id='line_3155'>      who has been renounced by the greater part of his spiritual</a>
<a id='line_3156'>      progeny. They alone persevere in the opinion, that the manhood of</a>
<a id='line_3157'>      Christ was created, or existed without creation, of a divine and</a>
<a id='line_3158'>      incorruptible substance. Their adversaries reproach them with the</a>
<a id='line_3159'>      adoration of a phantom; and they retort the accusation, by</a>
<a id='line_3160'>      deriding or execrating the blasphemy of the Jacobites, who impute</a>
<a id='line_3161'>      to the Godhead the vile infirmities of the flesh, even the</a>
<a id='line_3162'>      natural effects of nutrition and digestion. The religion of</a>
<a id='line_3163'>      Armenia could not derive much glory from the learning or the</a>
<a id='line_3164'>      power of its inhabitants. The royalty expired with the origin of</a>
<a id='line_3165'>      their schism; and their Christian kings, who arose and fell in</a>
<a id='line_3166'>      the thirteenth century on the confines of Cilicia, were the</a>
<a id='line_3167'>      clients of the Latins and the vassals of the Turkish sultan of</a>
<a id='line_3168'>      Iconium. The helpless nation has seldom been permitted to enjoy</a>
<a id='line_3169'>      the tranquillity of servitude. From the earliest period to the</a>
<a id='line_3170'>      present hour, Armenia has been the theatre of perpetual war: the</a>
<a id='line_3171'>      lands between Tauris and Erivan were dispeopled by the cruel</a>
<a id='line_3172'>      policy of the Sophis; and myriads of Christian families were</a>
<a id='line_3173'>      transplanted, to perish or to propagate in the distant provinces</a>
<a id='line_3174'>      of Persia. Under the rod of oppression, the zeal of the Armenians</a>
<a id='line_3175'>      is fervent and intrepid; they have often preferred the crown of</a>
<a id='line_3176'>      martyrdom to the white turban of Mahomet; they devoutly hate the</a>
<a id='line_3177'>      error and idolatry of the Greeks; and their transient union with</a>
<a id='line_3178'>      the Latins is not less devoid of truth, than the thousand</a>
<a id='line_3179'>      bishops, whom their patriarch offered at the feet of the Roman</a>
<a id='line_3180'>      pontiff. 142 The catholic, or patriarch, of the Armenians resides</a>

<a id='line_3186'>      have performed the liturgy, they cultivate the garden; and our</a>

<a id='line_3261'>      Justinian had not conquered in the cause of a heretic; Theodosius</a>
<a id='line_3262'>      himself was speedily, though gently, removed; and Paul of Tanis,</a>

<a id='line_3266'>      allowance of bread, which Diocletian had granted, was suppressed,</a>

<a id='line_3271'>      a Christian, or a bishop. Yet such is the blindness of ambition,</a>
<a id='line_3272'>      that, when Paul was expelled on a charge of murder, he solicited,</a>
<a id='line_3273'>      with a bribe of seven hundred pounds of gold, his restoration to</a>

<a id='line_3275'>      Apollinaris entered the hostile city in military array, alike</a>
<a id='line_3276'>      qualified for prayer or for battle. His troops, under arms, were</a>
<a id='line_3277'>      distributed through the streets; the gates of the cathedral were</a>
<a id='line_3278'>      guarded, and a chosen band was stationed in the choir, to defend</a>

<a id='line_3284'>      curses, and invectives, and stones, assaulted the odious minister</a>
<a id='line_3285'>      of the emperor and the synod. A charge was instantly sounded by</a>

<a id='line_3291'>      John, 147 labored in the conversion of heretics, with arms and</a>
<a id='line_3292'>      arguments more worthy of their evangelical profession. The</a>
<a id='line_3293'>      theological knowledge of Eulogius was displayed in many a volume,</a>

<a id='line_3373'>      conflict of zeal and persecution rekindled some sparks of their</a>
<a id='line_3374'>      national spirit. They abjured, with a foreign heresy, the manners</a>
<a id='line_3375'>      and language of the Greeks: every Melchite, in their eyes, was a</a>
<a id='line_3376'>      stranger, every Jacobite a citizen; the alliance of marriage, the</a>
<a id='line_3377'>      offices of humanity, were condemned as a deadly sin; the natives</a>
<a id='line_3378'>      renounced all allegiance to the emperor; and his orders, at a</a>

<a id='line_3382'>      poured forth their myriads of holy warriors, for whom death</a>

<a id='line_3384'>      experience has proved the distinction of active and passive</a>
<a id='line_3385'>      courage; the fanatic who endures without a groan the torture of</a>
<a id='line_3386'>      the rack or the stake, would tremble and fly before the face of</a>
<a id='line_3387'>      an armed enemy. The pusillanimous temper of the Egyptians could</a>

<a id='line_3608'>      Mendez, the Catholic patriarch of Aethiopia, accepted, in the</a>
<a id='line_3609'>      name of Urban VIII., the homage and abjuration of the penitent.</a>
<a id='line_3610'>      “I confess,” said the emperor on his knees, “I confess that the</a>
<a id='line_3611'>      pope is the vicar of Christ, the successor of St. Peter, and the</a>
<a id='line_3612'>      sovereign of the world. To him I swear true obedience, and at his</a>
<a id='line_3613'>      feet I offer my person and kingdom.” A similar oath was repeated</a>
<a id='line_3614'>      by his son, his brother, the clergy, the nobles, and even the</a>
<a id='line_3615'>      ladies of the court: the Latin patriarch was invested with honors</a>
<a id='line_3616'>      and wealth; and his missionaries erected their churches or</a>
<a id='line_3617'>      citadels in the most convenient stations of the empire. The</a>
<a id='line_3618'>      Jesuits themselves deplore the fatal indiscretion of their chief,</a>
<a id='line_3619'>      who forgot the mildness of the gospel and the policy of his</a>
<a id='line_3620'>      order, to introduce with hasty violence the liturgy of Rome and</a>
<a id='line_3621'>      the inquisition of Portugal. He condemned the ancient practice of</a>
<a id='line_3622'>      circumcision, which health, rather than superstition, had first</a>
<a id='line_3623'>      invented in the climate of Aethiopia. 160 A new baptism, a new</a>
<a id='line_3624'>      ordination, was inflicted on the natives; and they trembled with</a>
<a id='line_3625'>      horror when the most holy of the dead were torn from their</a>
<a id='line_3626'>      graves, when the most illustrious of the living were</a>
<a id='line_3627'>      excommunicated by a foreign priest. In the defense of their</a>
<a id='line_3628'>      religion and liberty, the Abyssinians rose in arms, with</a>
<a id='line_3629'>      desperate but unsuccessful zeal. Five rebellions were</a>
<a id='line_3630'>      extinguished in the blood of the insurgents: two abunas were</a>
<a id='line_3631'>      slain in battle, whole legions were slaughtered in the field, or</a>
<a id='line_3632'>      suffocated in their caverns; and neither merit, nor rank, nor</a>
<a id='line_3633'>      sex, could save from an ignominious death the enemies of Rome.</a>
<a id='line_3634'>      But the victorious monarch was finally subdued by the constancy</a>
<a id='line_3635'>      of the nation, of his mother, of his son, and of his most</a>
<a id='line_3636'>      faithful friends. Segued listened to the voice of pity, of</a>
<a id='line_3637'>      reason, perhaps of fear: and his edict of liberty of conscience</a>
<a id='line_3638'>      instantly revealed the tyranny and weakness of the Jesuits. On</a>
<a id='line_3639'>      the death of his father, Basilides expelled the Latin patriarch,</a>
<a id='line_3640'>      and restored to the wishes of the nation the faith and the</a>
<a id='line_3641'>      discipline of Egypt. The Monophysite churches resounded with a</a>
<a id='line_3642'>      song of triumph, “that the sheep of Aethiopia were now delivered</a>
<a id='line_3643'>      from the hyaenas of the West;” and the gates of that solitary</a>
<a id='line_3644'>      realm were forever shut against the arts, the science, and the</a>
<a id='line_3645'>      fanaticism of Europe. 161</a>
