<a id='line_8'></a>
<a id='line_9'>      The balance of power established by Diocletian subsisted no</a>
<a id='line_10'>      longer than while it was sustained by the firm and dexterous hand</a>
<a id='line_11'>      of the founder. It required such a fortunate mixture of different</a>
<a id='line_12'>      tempers and abilities as could scarcely be found or even expected</a>
<a id='line_13'>      a second time; two emperors without jealousy, two Cæsars without</a>
<a id='line_14'>      ambition, and the same general interest invariably pursued by</a>
<a id='line_15'>      four independent princes. The abdication of Diocletian and</a>
<a id='line_16'>      Maximian was succeeded by eighteen years of discord and</a>
<a id='line_17'>      confusion. The empire was afflicted by five civil wars; and the</a>
<a id='line_18'>      remainder of the time was not so much a state of tranquillity as</a>
<a id='line_19'>      a suspension of arms between several hostile monarchs, who,</a>
<a id='line_20'>      viewing each other with an eye of fear and hatred, strove to</a>
<a id='line_21'>      increase their respective forces at the expense of their</a>
<a id='line_22'>      subjects.</a>
<a id='line_23'></a>
<a id='line_24'>      As soon as Diocletian and Maximian had resigned the purple, their</a>
<a id='line_25'>      station, according to the rules of the new constitution, was</a>
<a id='line_26'>      filled by the two Cæsars, Constantius and Galerius, who</a>
<a id='line_27'>      immediately assumed the title of Augustus. 1</a>

<a id='line_31'>      Orosius and Eusebius, that, on this occasion, the empire, for the</a>
<a id='line_32'>      first time, was really divided into two parts. It is difficult,</a>
<a id='line_33'>      however, to discover in what respect the plan of Galerius</a>
<a id='line_34'>      differed from that of Diocletian.]</a>
<a id='line_35'></a>
<a id='line_36'>      The honors of seniority and precedence were allowed to the former</a>
<a id='line_37'>      of those princes, and he continued under a new appellation to</a>
<a id='line_38'>      administer his ancient department of Gaul, Spain, and Britain.</a>
<a id='line_39'></a>
<a id='line_40'>      The government of those ample provinces was sufficient to</a>
<a id='line_41'>      exercise his talents and to satisfy his ambition. Clemency,</a>
<a id='line_42'>      temperance, and moderation, distinguished the amiable character</a>
<a id='line_43'>      of Constantius, and his fortunate subjects had frequently</a>
<a id='line_44'>      occasion to compare the virtues of their sovereign with the</a>
<a id='line_45'>      passions of Maximian, and even with the arts of Diocletian. 2</a>
<a id='line_46'>      Instead of imitating their eastern pride and magnificence,</a>
<a id='line_47'>      Constantius preserved the modesty of a Roman prince. He declared,</a>
<a id='line_48'>      with unaffected sincerity, that his most valued treasure was in</a>
<a id='line_49'>      the hearts of his people, and that, whenever the dignity of the</a>
<a id='line_50'>      throne, or the danger of the state, required any extraordinary</a>
<a id='line_51'>      supply, he could depend with confidence on their gratitude and</a>
<a id='line_52'>      liberality. 3 The provincials of Gaul, Spain, and Britain,</a>
<a id='line_53'>      sensible of his worth, and of their own happiness, reflected with</a>
<a id='line_54'>      anxiety on the declining health of the emperor Constantius, and</a>
<a id='line_55'>      the tender age of his numerous family, the issue of his second</a>
<a id='line_56'>      marriage with the daughter of Maximian.</a>

<a id='line_69'></a>
<a id='line_70'>      The stern temper of Galerius was cast in a very different mould;</a>
<a id='line_71'>      and while he commanded the esteem of his subjects, he seldom</a>
<a id='line_72'>      condescended to solicit their affections. His fame in arms, and,</a>
<a id='line_73'>      above all, the success of the Persian war, had elated his haughty</a>
<a id='line_74'>      mind, which was naturally impatient of a superior, or even of an</a>
<a id='line_75'>      equal. If it were possible to rely on the partial testimony of an</a>
<a id='line_76'>      injudicious writer, we might ascribe the abdication of Diocletian</a>
<a id='line_77'>      to the menaces of Galerius, and relate the particulars of a</a>
<a id='line_78'>      _private_ conversation between the two princes, in which the</a>
<a id='line_79'>      former discovered as much pusillanimity as the latter displayed</a>
<a id='line_80'>      ingratitude and arrogance. 4 But these obscure anecdotes are</a>
<a id='line_81'>      sufficiently refuted by an impartial view of the character and</a>
<a id='line_82'>      conduct of Diocletian. Whatever might otherwise have been his</a>
<a id='line_83'>      intentions, if he had apprehended any danger from the violence of</a>
<a id='line_84'>      Galerius, his good sense would have instructed him to prevent the</a>
<a id='line_85'>      ignominious contest; and as he had held the sceptre with glory,</a>
<a id='line_86'>      he would have resigned it without disgrace.</a>

<a id='line_89'>      particulars of this conference more consistent with truth and</a>
<a id='line_90'>      decency, we might still ask how they came to the knowledge of an</a>
<a id='line_91'>      obscure rhetorician. But there are many historians who put us in</a>
<a id='line_92'>      mind of the admirable saying of the great Conde to Cardinal de</a>

<a id='line_94'>      fait eux-memes a notre place.” * Note: This attack upon</a>
<a id='line_95'>      Lactantius is unfounded. Lactantius was so far from having been</a>
<a id='line_96'>      an obscure rhetorician, that he had taught rhetoric publicly, and</a>
<a id='line_97'>      with the greatest success, first in Africa, and afterwards in</a>
<a id='line_98'>      Nicomedia. His reputation obtained him the esteem of Constantine,</a>
<a id='line_99'>      who invited him to his court, and intrusted to him the education</a>
<a id='line_100'>      of his son Crispus. The facts which he relates took place during</a>
<a id='line_101'>      his own time; he cannot be accused of dishonesty or imposture.</a>

<a id='line_109'>      the treatise is by no means certain. The fame of Lactantius for</a>
<a id='line_110'>      eloquence as well as for truth, would suffer no loss if it should</a>
<a id='line_111'>      be adjudged to some more “obscure rhetorician.” Manso, in his</a>

<a id='line_114'></a>
<a id='line_115'>      After the elevation of Constantius and Galerius to the rank of</a>
<a id='line_116'>      _Augusti_, two new _Cæsars_ were required to supply their place,</a>
<a id='line_117'>      and to complete the system of the Imperial government. Diocletian</a>
<a id='line_118'>      was sincerely desirous of withdrawing himself from the world; he</a>
<a id='line_119'>      considered Galerius, who had married his daughter, as the firmest</a>
<a id='line_120'>      support of his family and of the empire; and he consented,</a>
<a id='line_121'>      without reluctance, that his successor should assume the merit as</a>
<a id='line_122'>      well as the envy of the important nomination. It was fixed</a>
<a id='line_123'>      without consulting the interest or inclination of the princes of</a>
<a id='line_124'>      the West. Each of them had a son who was arrived at the age of</a>
<a id='line_125'>      manhood, and who might have been deemed the most natural</a>
<a id='line_126'>      candidates for the vacant honor. But the impotent resentment of</a>
<a id='line_127'>      Maximian was no longer to be dreaded; and the moderate</a>
<a id='line_128'>      Constantius, though he might despise the dangers, was humanely</a>
<a id='line_129'>      apprehensive of the calamities, of civil war. The two persons</a>
<a id='line_130'>      whom Galerius promoted to the rank of Cæsar were much better</a>
<a id='line_131'>      suited to serve the views of his ambition; and their principal</a>
<a id='line_132'>      recommendation seems to have consisted in the want of merit or</a>
<a id='line_133'>      personal consequence. The first of these was Daza, or, as he was</a>
<a id='line_134'>      afterwards called, Maximin, whose mother was the sister of</a>
<a id='line_135'>      Galerius. The unexperienced youth still betrayed, by his manners</a>
<a id='line_136'>      and language, his rustic education, when, to his own</a>
<a id='line_137'>      astonishment, as well as that of the world, he was invested by</a>
<a id='line_138'>      Diocletian with the purple, exalted to the dignity of Cæsar, and</a>
<a id='line_139'>      intrusted with the sovereign command of Egypt and Syria. 5 At the</a>
<a id='line_140'>      same time, Severus, a faithful servant, addicted to pleasure, but</a>
<a id='line_141'>      not incapable of business, was sent to Milan, to receive, from</a>
<a id='line_142'>      the reluctant hands of Maximian, the Cæsarian ornaments, and the</a>
<a id='line_143'>      possession of Italy and Africa. According to the forms of the</a>
<a id='line_144'>      constitution, Severus acknowledged the supremacy of the western</a>
<a id='line_145'>      emperor; but he was absolutely devoted to the commands of his</a>
<a id='line_146'>      benefactor Galerius, who, reserving to himself the intermediate</a>
<a id='line_147'>      countries from the confines of Italy to those of Syria, firmly</a>
<a id='line_148'>      established his power over three fourths of the monarchy. In the</a>
<a id='line_149'>      full confidence that the approaching death of Constantius would</a>
<a id='line_150'>      leave him sole master of the Roman world, we are assured that he</a>
<a id='line_151'>      had arranged in his mind a long succession of future princes, and</a>
<a id='line_152'>      that he meditated his own retreat from public life, after he</a>
<a id='line_153'>      should have accomplished a glorious reign of about twenty years.</a>

<a id='line_165'>      doubtful authority of Lactantius de M. P. c. 20.]</a>
<a id='line_166'></a>
<a id='line_167'>      But within less than eighteen months, two unexpected revolutions</a>
<a id='line_168'>      overturned the ambitious schemes of Galerius. The hopes of</a>
<a id='line_169'>      uniting the western provinces to his empire were disappointed by</a>
<a id='line_170'>      the elevation of Constantine, whilst Italy and Africa were lost</a>
<a id='line_171'>      by the successful revolt of Maxentius.</a>
<a id='line_172'></a>
<a id='line_173'>      I. The fame of Constantine has rendered posterity attentive to</a>
<a id='line_174'>      the most minute circumstances of his life and actions. The place</a>
<a id='line_175'>      of his birth, as well as the condition of his mother Helena, have</a>
<a id='line_176'>      been the subject, not only of literary, but of national disputes.</a>
<a id='line_177'>      Notwithstanding the recent tradition, which assigns for her</a>
<a id='line_178'>      father a British king, 8 we are obliged to confess, that Helena</a>
<a id='line_179'>      was the daughter of an innkeeper; but at the same time, we may</a>
<a id='line_180'>      defend the legality of her marriage, against those who have</a>
<a id='line_181'>      represented her as the concubine of Constantius. 9 The great</a>
<a id='line_182'>      Constantine was most probably born at Naissus, in Dacia; 10 and</a>
<a id='line_183'>      it is not surprising that, in a family and province distinguished</a>
<a id='line_184'>      only by the profession of arms, the youth should discover very</a>
<a id='line_185'>      little inclination to improve his mind by the acquisition of</a>
<a id='line_186'>      knowledge. 11 He was about eighteen years of age when his father</a>
<a id='line_187'>      was promoted to the rank of Cæsar; but that fortunate event was</a>
<a id='line_188'>      attended with his mother’s divorce; and the splendor of an</a>
<a id='line_189'>      Imperial alliance reduced the son of Helena to a state of</a>
<a id='line_190'>      disgrace and humiliation. Instead of following Constantius in the</a>
<a id='line_191'>      West, he remained in the service of Diocletian, signalized his</a>
<a id='line_192'>      valor in the wars of Egypt and Persia, and gradually rose to the</a>
<a id='line_193'>      honorable station of a tribune of the first order. The figure of</a>
<a id='line_194'>      Constantine was tall and majestic; he was dexterous in all his</a>
<a id='line_195'>      exercises, intrepid in war, affable in peace; in his whole</a>
<a id='line_196'>      conduct, the active spirit of youth was tempered by habitual</a>
<a id='line_197'>      prudence; and while his mind was engrossed by ambition, he</a>
<a id='line_198'>      appeared cold and insensible to the allurements of pleasure. The</a>
<a id='line_199'>      favor of the people and soldiers, who had named him as a worthy</a>
<a id='line_200'>      candidate for the rank of Cæsar, served only to exasperate the</a>
<a id='line_201'>      jealousy of Galerius; and though prudence might restrain him from</a>
<a id='line_202'>      exercising any open violence, an absolute monarch is seldom at a</a>
<a id='line_203'>      loss how to execute a sure and secret revenge. 12 Every hour</a>
<a id='line_204'>      increased the danger of Constantine, and the anxiety of his</a>
<a id='line_205'>      father, who, by repeated letters, expressed the warmest desire of</a>
<a id='line_206'>      embracing his son. For some time the policy of Galerius supplied</a>
<a id='line_207'>      him with delays and excuses; but it was impossible long to refuse</a>
<a id='line_208'>      so natural a request of his associate, without maintaining his</a>
<a id='line_209'>      refusal by arms. The permission of the journey was reluctantly</a>
<a id='line_210'>      granted, and whatever precautions the emperor might have taken to</a>
<a id='line_211'>      intercept a return, the consequences of which he, with so much</a>
<a id='line_212'>      reason, apprehended, they were effectually disappointed by the</a>
<a id='line_213'>      incredible diligence of Constantine. 13 Leaving the palace of</a>
<a id='line_214'>      Nicomedia in the night, he travelled post through Bithynia,</a>
<a id='line_215'>      Thrace, Dacia, Pannonia, Italy, and Gaul, and, amidst the joyful</a>
<a id='line_216'>      acclamations of the people, reached the port of Boulogne in the</a>
<a id='line_217'>      very moment when his father was preparing to embark for Britain.</a>

<a id='line_237'>      10 (return) [ There are three opinions with regard to the place</a>
<a id='line_238'>      of Constantine’s birth. 1. Our English antiquarians were used to</a>
<a id='line_239'>      dwell with rapture on the words of his panegyrist, “Britannias</a>
<a id='line_240'>      illic oriendo nobiles fecisti.” But this celebrated passage may</a>
<a id='line_241'>      be referred with as much propriety to the accession, as to the</a>
<a id='line_242'>      nativity of Constantine. 2. Some of the modern Greeks have</a>
<a id='line_243'>      ascribed the honor of his birth to Drepanum, a town on the Gulf</a>
<a id='line_244'>      of Nicomedia, (Cellarius, tom. ii. p. 174,) which Constantine</a>
<a id='line_245'>      dignified with the name of Helenopolis, and Justinian adorned</a>
<a id='line_246'>      with many splendid buildings, (Procop. de Edificiis, v. 2.) It is</a>
<a id='line_247'>      indeed probable enough, that Helena’s father kept an inn at</a>
<a id='line_248'>      Drepanum, and that Constantius might lodge there when he returned</a>
<a id='line_249'>      from a Persian embassy, in the reign of Aurelian. But in the</a>
<a id='line_250'>      wandering life of a soldier, the place of his marriage, and the</a>
<a id='line_251'>      places where his children are born, have very little connection</a>
<a id='line_252'>      with each other. 3. The claim of Naissus is supported by the</a>

<a id='line_306'>      opinion of their own importance, and the assurance that Britain,</a>
<a id='line_307'>      Gaul, and Spain would acquiesce in their nomination, were</a>
<a id='line_308'>      diligently inculcated to the legions by the adherents of</a>

<a id='line_313'>      please the sovereign of Asia to bestow the armies and provinces</a>

<a id='line_316'>      Constantine; nor did that artful prince show himself to the</a>

<a id='line_319'>      and had he been less actuated by ambition, it was his only means</a>
<a id='line_320'>      of safety. He was well acquainted with the character and</a>
<a id='line_321'>      sentiments of Galerius, and sufficiently apprised, that if he</a>
<a id='line_322'>      wished to live he must determine to reign. The decent and even</a>
<a id='line_323'>      obstinate resistance which he chose to affect, 16 was contrived</a>
<a id='line_324'>      to justify his usurpation; nor did he yield to the acclamations</a>
<a id='line_325'>      of the army, till he had provided the proper materials for a</a>
<a id='line_326'>      letter, which he immediately despatched to the emperor of the</a>
<a id='line_327'>      East. Constantine informed him of the melancholy event of his</a>

<a id='line_329'>      succession, and respectfully lamented, that the affectionate</a>
<a id='line_330'>      violence of his troops had not permitted him to solicit the</a>
<a id='line_331'>      Imperial purple in the regular and constitutional manner. The</a>
<a id='line_332'>      first emotions of Galerius were those of surprise,</a>
<a id='line_333'>      disappointment, and rage; and as he could seldom restrain his</a>
<a id='line_334'>      passions, he loudly threatened, that he would commit to the</a>
<a id='line_335'>      flames both the letter and the messenger. But his resentment</a>
<a id='line_336'>      insensibly subsided; and when he recollected the doubtful chance</a>

<a id='line_398'>      the unexpected loss of Italy wounded his pride as well as power</a>
<a id='line_399'>      in a still more sensible part. The long absence of the emperors</a>
<a id='line_400'>      had filled Rome with discontent and indignation; and the people</a>
<a id='line_401'>      gradually discovered, that the preference given to Nicomedia and</a>
<a id='line_402'>      Milan was not to be ascribed to the particular inclination of</a>
<a id='line_403'>      Diocletian, but to the permanent form of government which he had</a>
<a id='line_404'>      instituted. It was in vain that, a few months after his</a>
<a id='line_405'>      abdication, his successors dedicated, under his name, those</a>
<a id='line_406'>      magnificent baths, whose ruins still supply the ground as well as</a>
<a id='line_407'>      the materials for so many churches and convents. 20 The</a>
<a id='line_408'>      tranquility of those elegant recesses of ease and luxury was</a>
<a id='line_409'>      disturbed by the impatient murmurs of the Romans, and a report</a>
<a id='line_410'>      was insensibly circulated, that the sums expended in erecting</a>
<a id='line_411'>      those buildings would soon be required at their hands. About that</a>
<a id='line_412'>      time the avarice of Galerius, or perhaps the exigencies of the</a>
<a id='line_413'>      state, had induced him to make a very strict and rigorous</a>
<a id='line_414'>      inquisition into the property of his subjects, for the purpose of</a>
<a id='line_415'>      a general taxation, both on their lands and on their persons. A</a>
<a id='line_416'>      very minute survey appears to have been taken of their real</a>
<a id='line_417'>      estates; and wherever there was the slightest suspicion of</a>
<a id='line_418'>      concealment, torture was very freely employed to obtain a sincere</a>
<a id='line_419'>      declaration of their personal wealth. 21 The privileges which had</a>
<a id='line_420'>      exalted Italy above the rank of the provinces were no longer</a>
<a id='line_421'>      regarded: 211 and the officers of the revenue already began to</a>
<a id='line_422'>      number the Roman people, and to settle the proportion of the new</a>
<a id='line_423'>      taxes. Even when the spirit of freedom had been utterly</a>
<a id='line_424'>      extinguished, the tamest subjects have sometimes ventured to</a>
<a id='line_425'>      resist an unprecedented invasion of their property; but on this</a>
<a id='line_426'>      occasion the injury was aggravated by the insult, and the sense</a>
<a id='line_427'>      of private interest was quickened by that of national honor. The</a>
<a id='line_428'>      conquest of Macedonia, as we have already observed, had delivered</a>
<a id='line_429'>      the Roman people from the weight of personal taxes.</a>
<a id='line_430'></a>
<a id='line_431'>      Though they had experienced every form of despotism, they had now</a>
<a id='line_432'>      enjoyed that exemption near five hundred years; nor could they</a>
<a id='line_433'>      patiently brook the insolence of an Illyrian peasant, who, from</a>
<a id='line_434'>      his distant residence in Asia, presumed to number Rome among the</a>
<a id='line_435'>      tributary cities of his empire. The rising fury of the people was</a>
<a id='line_436'>      encouraged by the authority, or at least the connivance, of the</a>
<a id='line_437'>      senate; and the feeble remains of the Prætorian guards, who had</a>

<a id='line_439'>      a pretence, and declared their readiness to draw their swords in</a>
<a id='line_440'>      the service of their oppressed country. It was the wish, and it</a>
<a id='line_441'>      soon became the hope, of every citizen, that after expelling from</a>
<a id='line_442'>      Italy their foreign tyrants, they should elect a prince who, by</a>
<a id='line_443'>      the place of his residence, and by his maxims of government,</a>
<a id='line_444'>      might once more deserve the title of Roman emperor. The name, as</a>

<a id='line_509'>      According to the advice, or rather the orders, of his colleague,</a>
<a id='line_510'>      the emperor Severus immediately hastened to Rome, in the full</a>
<a id='line_511'>      confidence, that, by his unexpected celerity, he should easily</a>
<a id='line_512'>      suppress the tumult of an unwarlike populace, commanded by a</a>
<a id='line_513'>      licentious youth. But he found on his arrival the gates of the</a>
<a id='line_514'>      city shut against him, the walls filled with men and arms, an</a>
<a id='line_515'>      experienced general at the head of the rebels, and his own troops</a>
<a id='line_516'>      without spirit or affection. A large body of Moors deserted to</a>
<a id='line_517'>      the enemy, allured by the promise of a large donative; and, if it</a>
<a id='line_518'>      be true that they had been levied by Maximian in his African war,</a>
<a id='line_519'>      preferring the natural feelings of gratitude to the artificial</a>
<a id='line_520'>      ties of allegiance. Anulinus, the Prætorian præfect, declared</a>
<a id='line_521'>      himself in favor of Maxentius, and drew after him the most</a>
<a id='line_522'>      considerable part of the troops, accustomed to obey his commands.</a>
<a id='line_523'></a>
<a id='line_524'>      Rome, according to the expression of an orator, recalled her</a>
<a id='line_525'>      armies; and the unfortunate Severus, destitute of force and of</a>
<a id='line_526'>      counsel, retired, or rather fled, with precipitation, to Ravenna.</a>
<a id='line_527'></a>
<a id='line_528'>      Here he might for some time have been safe. The fortifications of</a>
<a id='line_529'>      Ravenna were able to resist the attempts, and the morasses that</a>
<a id='line_530'>      surrounded the town were sufficient to prevent the approach, of</a>
<a id='line_531'>      the Italian army. The sea, which Severus commanded with a</a>
<a id='line_532'>      powerful fleet, secured him an inexhaustible supply of</a>
<a id='line_533'>      provisions, and gave a free entrance to the legions, which, on</a>
<a id='line_534'>      the return of spring, would advance to his assistance from</a>
<a id='line_535'>      Illyricum and the East. Maximian, who conducted the siege in</a>
<a id='line_536'>      person, was soon convinced that he might waste his time and his</a>
<a id='line_537'>      army in the fruitless enterprise, and that he had nothing to hope</a>
<a id='line_538'>      either from force or famine. With an art more suitable to the</a>
<a id='line_539'>      character of Diocletian than to his own, he directed his attack,</a>
<a id='line_540'>      not so much against the walls of Ravenna, as against the mind of</a>
<a id='line_541'>      Severus. The treachery which he had experienced disposed that</a>
<a id='line_542'>      unhappy prince to distrust the most sincere of his friends and</a>
<a id='line_543'>      adherents. The emissaries of Maximian easily persuaded his</a>
<a id='line_544'>      credulity, that a conspiracy was formed to betray the town, and</a>
<a id='line_545'>      prevailed upon his fears not to expose himself to the discretion</a>
<a id='line_546'>      of an irritated conqueror, but to accept the faith of an</a>
<a id='line_547'>      honorable capitulation. He was at first received with humanity</a>
<a id='line_548'>      and treated with respect. Maximian conducted the captive emperor</a>
<a id='line_549'>      to Rome, and gave him the most solemn assurances that he had</a>
<a id='line_550'>      secured his life by the resignation of the purple. But Severus</a>
<a id='line_551'>      could obtain only an easy death and an Imperial funeral. When the</a>
<a id='line_552'>      sentence was signified to him, the manner of executing it was</a>
<a id='line_553'>      left to his own choice; he preferred the favorite mode of the</a>
<a id='line_554'>      ancients, that of opening his veins; and as soon as he expired,</a>
<a id='line_555'>      his body was carried to the sepulchre which had been constructed</a>

<a id='line_598'>      The importance of the occasion called for the presence and</a>
<a id='line_599'>      abilities of Galerius. At the head of a powerful army, collected</a>
<a id='line_600'>      from Illyricum and the East, he entered Italy, resolved to</a>
<a id='line_601'>      revenge the death of Severus, and to chastise the rebellious</a>
<a id='line_602'>      Romans; or, as he expressed his intentions, in the furious</a>
<a id='line_603'>      language of a barbarian, to extirpate the senate, and to destroy</a>
<a id='line_604'>      the people by the sword. But the skill of Maximian had concerted</a>
<a id='line_605'>      a prudent system of defence. The invader found every place</a>
<a id='line_606'>      hostile, fortified, and inaccessible; and though he forced his</a>
<a id='line_607'>      way as far as Narni, within sixty miles of Rome, his dominion in</a>
<a id='line_608'>      Italy was confined to the narrow limits of his camp. Sensible of</a>
<a id='line_609'>      the increasing difficulties of his enterprise, the haughty</a>
<a id='line_610'>      Galerius made the first advances towards a reconciliation, and</a>
<a id='line_611'>      despatched two of his most considerable officers to tempt the</a>
<a id='line_612'>      Roman princes by the offer of a conference, and the declaration</a>
<a id='line_613'>      of his paternal regard for Maxentius, who might obtain much more</a>
<a id='line_614'>      from his liberality than he could hope from the doubtful chance</a>
<a id='line_615'>      of war. 25 The offers of Galerius were rejected with firmness,</a>
<a id='line_616'>      his perfidious friendship refused with contempt, and it was not</a>
<a id='line_617'>      long before he discovered, that, unless he provided for his</a>
<a id='line_618'>      safety by a timely retreat, he had some reason to apprehend the</a>
<a id='line_619'>      fate of Severus. The wealth which the Romans defended against his</a>
<a id='line_620'>      rapacious tyranny, they freely contributed for his destruction.</a>
<a id='line_621'>      The name of Maximian, the popular arts of his son, the secret</a>
<a id='line_622'>      distribution of large sums, and the promise of still more liberal</a>
<a id='line_623'>      rewards, checked the ardor and corrupted the fidelity of the</a>
<a id='line_624'>      Illyrian legions; and when Galerius at length gave the signal of</a>
<a id='line_625'>      the retreat, it was with some difficulty that he could prevail on</a>
<a id='line_626'>      his veterans not to desert a banner which had so often conducted</a>
<a id='line_627'>      them to victory and honor. A contemporary writer assigns two</a>
<a id='line_628'>      other causes for the failure of the expedition; but they are both</a>
<a id='line_629'>      of such a nature, that a cautious historian will scarcely venture</a>
<a id='line_630'>      to adopt them. We are told that Galerius, who had formed a very</a>
<a id='line_631'>      imperfect notion of the greatness of Rome by the cities of the</a>
<a id='line_632'>      East with which he was acquainted, found his forces inadequate to</a>
<a id='line_633'>      the siege of that immense capital.</a>
<a id='line_634'></a>
<a id='line_635'>      But the extent of a city serves only to render it more accessible</a>
<a id='line_636'>      to the enemy: Rome had long since been accustomed to submit on</a>
<a id='line_637'>      the approach of a conqueror; nor could the temporary enthusiasm</a>
<a id='line_638'>      of the people have long contended against the discipline and</a>
<a id='line_639'>      valor of the legions. We are likewise informed that the legions</a>
<a id='line_640'>      themselves were struck with horror and remorse, and that those</a>
<a id='line_641'>      pious sons of the republic refused to violate the sanctity of</a>
<a id='line_642'>      their venerable parent. 26 But when we recollect with how much</a>
<a id='line_643'>      ease, in the more ancient civil wars, the zeal of party and the</a>
<a id='line_644'>      habits of military obedience had converted the native citizens of</a>
<a id='line_645'>      Rome into her most implacable enemies, we shall be inclined to</a>
<a id='line_646'>      distrust this extreme delicacy of strangers and barbarians, who</a>
<a id='line_647'>      had never beheld Italy till they entered it in a hostile manner.</a>
<a id='line_648'>      Had they not been restrained by motives of a more interested</a>
<a id='line_649'>      nature, they would probably have answered Galerius in the words</a>
<a id='line_650'>      of Cæsar’s veterans: “If our general wishes to lead us to the</a>
<a id='line_651'>      banks of the Tyber, we are prepared to trace out his camp.</a>
<a id='line_652'>      Whatsoever walls he has determined to level with the ground, our</a>
<a id='line_653'>      hands are ready to work the engines: nor shall we hesitate,</a>

<a id='line_699'></a>
<a id='line_700'>      The mind of Galerius was the most susceptible of the sterner</a>
<a id='line_701'>      passions, but it was not, however, incapable of a sincere and</a>
<a id='line_702'>      lasting friendship. Licinius, whose manners as well as character</a>
<a id='line_703'>      were not unlike his own, seems to have engaged both his affection</a>
<a id='line_704'>      and esteem. Their intimacy had commenced in the happier period</a>
<a id='line_705'>      perhaps of their youth and obscurity. It had been cemented by the</a>
<a id='line_706'>      freedom and dangers of a military life; they had advanced almost</a>
<a id='line_707'>      by equal steps through the successive honors of the service; and</a>
<a id='line_708'>      as soon as Galerius was invested with the Imperial dignity, he</a>
<a id='line_709'>      seems to have conceived the design of raising his companion to</a>
<a id='line_710'>      the same rank with himself. During the short period of his</a>
<a id='line_711'>      prosperity, he considered the rank of Cæsar as unworthy of the</a>
<a id='line_712'>      age and merit of Licinius, and rather chose to reserve for him</a>
<a id='line_713'>      the place of Constantius, and the empire of the West. While the</a>
<a id='line_714'>      emperor was employed in the Italian war, he intrusted his friend</a>
<a id='line_715'>      with the defence of the Danube; and immediately after his return</a>

<a id='line_718'>      provinces of Illyricum. 29 The news of his promotion was no</a>
<a id='line_719'>      sooner carried into the East, than Maximin, who governed, or</a>
<a id='line_720'>      rather oppressed, the countries of Egypt and Syria, betrayed his</a>
<a id='line_721'>      envy and discontent, disdained the inferior name of Cæsar, and,</a>

<a id='line_724'>      the first, and indeed for the last time, the Roman world was</a>

<a id='line_766'>      secretly contriving new mischiefs. But Galerius, who was well</a>
<a id='line_767'>      acquainted with his character, soon obliged him to leave his</a>
<a id='line_768'>      dominions, and the last refuge of the disappointed Maximian was</a>
<a id='line_769'>      the court of his son-in-law Constantine. 33 He was received with</a>
<a id='line_770'>      respect by that artful prince, and with the appearance of filial</a>
<a id='line_771'>      tenderness by the empress Fausta. That he might remove every</a>
<a id='line_772'>      suspicion, he resigned the Imperial purple a second time, 34</a>
<a id='line_773'>      professing himself at length convinced of the vanity of greatness</a>
<a id='line_774'>      and ambition. Had he persevered in this resolution, he might have</a>
<a id='line_775'>      ended his life with less dignity, indeed, than in his first</a>
<a id='line_776'>      retirement, yet, however, with comfort and reputation. But the</a>
<a id='line_777'>      near prospect of a throne brought back to his remembrance the</a>
<a id='line_778'>      state from whence he was fallen, and he resolved, by a desperate</a>
<a id='line_779'>      effort, either to reign or to perish. An incursion of the Franks</a>
<a id='line_780'>      had summoned Constantine, with a part of his army, to the banks</a>
<a id='line_781'>      of the Rhine; the remainder of the troops were stationed in the</a>
<a id='line_782'>      southern provinces of Gaul, which lay exposed to the enterprises</a>
<a id='line_783'>      of the Italian emperor, and a considerable treasure was deposited</a>
<a id='line_784'>      in the city of Arles. Maximian either craftily invented, or</a>
<a id='line_785'>      easily credited, a vain report of the death of Constantine.</a>
<a id='line_786'>      Without hesitation he ascended the throne, seized the treasure,</a>
<a id='line_787'>      and scattering it with his accustomed profusion among the</a>
<a id='line_788'>      soldiers, endeavored to awake in their minds the memory of his</a>
<a id='line_789'>      ancient dignity and exploits. Before he could establish his</a>
<a id='line_790'>      authority, or finish the negotiation which he appears to have</a>
<a id='line_791'>      entered into with his son Maxentius, the celerity of Constantine</a>
<a id='line_792'>      defeated all his hopes. On the first news of his perfidy and</a>
<a id='line_793'>      ingratitude, that prince returned by rapid marches from the Rhine</a>
<a id='line_794'>      to the Saone, embarked on the last-mentioned river at Chalons,</a>
<a id='line_795'>      and, at Lyons trusting himself to the rapidity of the Rhone,</a>
<a id='line_796'>      arrived at the gates of Arles with a military force which it was</a>
<a id='line_797'>      impossible for Maximian to resist, and which scarcely permitted</a>
<a id='line_798'>      him to take refuge in the neighboring city of Marseilles. The</a>
<a id='line_799'>      narrow neck of land which joined that place to the continent was</a>
<a id='line_800'>      fortified against the besiegers, whilst the sea was open, either</a>
<a id='line_801'>      for the escape of Maximian, or for the succor of Maxentius, if</a>
<a id='line_802'>      the latter should choose to disguise his invasion of Gaul under</a>
<a id='line_803'>      the honorable pretence of defending a distressed, or, as he might</a>
<a id='line_804'>      allege, an injured father. Apprehensive of the fatal consequences</a>
<a id='line_805'>      of delay, Constantine gave orders for an immediate assault; but</a>
<a id='line_806'>      the scaling-ladders were found too short for the height of the</a>
<a id='line_807'>      walls, and Marseilles might have sustained as long a siege as it</a>
<a id='line_808'>      formerly did against the arms of Cæsar, if the garrison,</a>
<a id='line_809'>      conscious either of their fault or of their danger, had not</a>
<a id='line_810'>      purchased their pardon by delivering up the city and the person</a>
<a id='line_811'>      of Maximian. A secret but irrevocable sentence of death was</a>
<a id='line_812'>      pronounced against the usurper; he obtained only the same favor</a>
<a id='line_813'>      which he had indulged to Severus, and it was published to the</a>
<a id='line_814'>      world, that, oppressed by the remorse of his repeated crimes, he</a>
<a id='line_815'>      strangled himself with his own hands. After he had lost the</a>
<a id='line_816'>      assistance, and disdained the moderate counsels, of Diocletian,</a>
<a id='line_817'>      the second period of his active life was a series of public</a>
<a id='line_818'>      calamities and personal mortifications, which were terminated, in</a>
<a id='line_819'>      about three years, by an ignominious death. He deserved his fate;</a>
<a id='line_820'>      but we should find more reason to applaud the humanity of</a>
<a id='line_821'>      Constantine, if he had spared an old man, the benefactor of his</a>
<a id='line_822'>      father, and the father of his wife. During the whole of this</a>
<a id='line_823'>      melancholy transaction, it appears that Fausta sacrificed the</a>

<a id='line_868'>      the moment of his death, the first place among the princes of the</a>
<a id='line_869'>      Roman world. He survived his retreat from Italy about four years;</a>

<a id='line_871'>      devoted the remainder of his life to the enjoyment of pleasure,</a>
<a id='line_872'>      and to the execution of some works of public utility, among which</a>
<a id='line_873'>      we may distinguish the discharging into the Danube the</a>
<a id='line_874'>      superfluous waters of the Lake Pelso, and the cutting down the</a>
<a id='line_875'>      immense forests that encompassed it; an operation worthy of a</a>
<a id='line_876'>      monarch, since it gave an extensive country to the agriculture of</a>
<a id='line_877'>      his Pannonian subjects. 36 His death was occasioned by a very</a>
<a id='line_878'>      painful and lingering disorder. His body, swelled by an</a>
<a id='line_879'>      intemperate course of life to an unwieldy corpulence, was covered</a>
<a id='line_880'>      with ulcers, and devoured by innumerable swarms of those insects</a>
<a id='line_881'>      which have given their name to a most loathsome disease; 37 but</a>
<a id='line_882'>      as Galerius had offended a very zealous and powerful party among</a>
<a id='line_883'>      his subjects, his sufferings, instead of exciting their</a>
<a id='line_884'>      compassion, have been celebrated as the visible effects of divine</a>
<a id='line_885'>      justice. 38 He had no sooner expired in his palace of Nicomedia,</a>
<a id='line_886'>      than the two emperors who were indebted for their purple to his</a>
<a id='line_887'>      favors, began to collect their forces, with the intention either</a>
<a id='line_888'>      of disputing, or of dividing, the dominions which he had left</a>
<a id='line_889'>      without a master. They were persuaded, however, to desist from</a>
<a id='line_890'>      the former design, and to agree in the latter. The provinces of</a>
<a id='line_891'>      Asia fell to the share of Maximin, and those of Europe augmented</a>
<a id='line_892'>      the portion of Licinius. The Hellespont and the Thracian</a>
<a id='line_893'>      Bosphorus formed their mutual boundary, and the banks of those</a>
<a id='line_894'>      narrow seas, which flowed in the midst of the Roman world, were</a>
<a id='line_895'>      covered with soldiers, with arms, and with fortifications. The</a>
<a id='line_896'>      deaths of Maximian and of Galerius reduced the number of emperors</a>
<a id='line_897'>      to four. The sense of their true interest soon connected Licinius</a>
<a id='line_898'>      and Constantine; a secret alliance was concluded between Maximin</a>
<a id='line_899'>      and Maxentius, and their unhappy subjects expected with terror</a>
<a id='line_900'>      the bloody consequences of their inevitable dissensions, which</a>
<a id='line_901'>      were no longer restrained by the fear or the respect which they</a>

<a id='line_930'>      Among so many crimes and misfortunes, occasioned by the passions</a>
<a id='line_931'>      of the Roman princes, there is some pleasure in discovering a</a>
<a id='line_932'>      single action which may be ascribed to their virtue. In the sixth</a>
<a id='line_933'>      year of his reign, Constantine visited the city of Autun, and</a>
<a id='line_934'>      generously remitted the arrears of tribute, reducing at the same</a>
<a id='line_935'>      time the proportion of their assessment from twenty-five to</a>
<a id='line_936'>      eighteen thousand heads, subject to the real and personal</a>
<a id='line_937'>      capitation. 40 Yet even this indulgence affords the most</a>
<a id='line_938'>      unquestionable proof of the public misery. This tax was so</a>
<a id='line_939'>      extremely oppressive, either in itself or in the mode of</a>
<a id='line_940'>      collecting it, that whilst the revenue was increased by</a>
<a id='line_941'>      extortion, it was diminished by despair: a considerable part of</a>
<a id='line_942'>      the territory of Autun was left uncultivated; and great numbers</a>
<a id='line_943'>      of the provincials rather chose to live as exiles and outlaws,</a>
<a id='line_944'>      than to support the weight of civil society. It is but too</a>
<a id='line_945'>      probable, that the bountiful emperor relieved, by a partial act</a>
<a id='line_946'>      of liberality, one among the many evils which he had caused by</a>
<a id='line_947'>      his general maxims of administration. But even those maxims were</a>

<a id='line_976'>      Italy and Africa groaned under the dominion of a tyrant, as</a>

<a id='line_982'>      Maxentius was cruel, rapacious, and profligate. 42 He had the</a>
<a id='line_983'>      good fortune to suppress a slight rebellion in Africa. The</a>
<a id='line_984'>      governor and a few adherents had been guilty; the province</a>
<a id='line_985'>      suffered for their crime. The flourishing cities of Cirtha and</a>
<a id='line_986'>      Carthage, and the whole extent of that fertile country, were</a>
<a id='line_987'>      wasted by fire and sword. The abuse of victory was followed by</a>
<a id='line_988'>      the abuse of law and justice. A formidable army of sycophants and</a>
<a id='line_989'>      delators invaded Africa; the rich and the noble were easily</a>
<a id='line_990'>      convicted of a connection with the rebels; and those among them</a>
<a id='line_991'>      who experienced the emperor’s clemency, were only punished by the</a>
<a id='line_992'>      confiscation of their estates. 43 So signal a victory was</a>
<a id='line_993'>      celebrated by a magnificent triumph, and Maxentius exposed to the</a>
<a id='line_994'>      eyes of the people the spoils and captives of a Roman province.</a>
<a id='line_995'>      The state of the capital was no less deserving of compassion than</a>
<a id='line_996'>      that of Africa. The wealth of Rome supplied an inexhaustible fund</a>
<a id='line_997'>      for his vain and prodigal expenses, and the ministers of his</a>
<a id='line_998'>      revenue were skilled in the arts of rapine. It was under his</a>
<a id='line_999'>      reign that the method of exacting a _free gift_ from the senators</a>
<a id='line_1000'>      was first invented; and as the sum was insensibly increased, the</a>
<a id='line_1001'>      pretences of levying it, a victory, a birth, a marriage, or an</a>
<a id='line_1002'>      imperial consulship, were proportionably multiplied. 44 Maxentius</a>
<a id='line_1003'>      had imbibed the same implacable aversion to the senate, which had</a>
<a id='line_1004'>      characterized most of the former tyrants of Rome; nor was it</a>
<a id='line_1005'>      possible for his ungrateful temper to forgive the generous</a>
<a id='line_1006'>      fidelity which had raised him to the throne, and supported him</a>
<a id='line_1007'>      against all his enemies. The lives of the senators were exposed</a>
<a id='line_1008'>      to his jealous suspicions, the dishonor of their wives and</a>
<a id='line_1009'>      daughters heightened the gratification of his sensual passions.</a>
<a id='line_1010'>      45 It may be presumed that an Imperial lover was seldom reduced</a>
<a id='line_1011'>      to sigh in vain; but whenever persuasion proved ineffectual, he</a>
<a id='line_1012'>      had recourse to violence; and there remains _one_ memorable</a>
<a id='line_1013'>      example of a noble matron, who preserved her chastity by a</a>
<a id='line_1014'>      voluntary death. The soldiers were the only order of men whom he</a>

<a id='line_1127'>      ancient establishment; and they composed, including the rest of</a>

<a id='line_1129'>      body of fourscore thousand men. Forty thousand Moors and</a>

<a id='line_1143'>      to his private quarrel. 52 At the head of about forty thousand</a>
<a id='line_1144'>      soldiers he marched to encounter an enemy whose numbers were at</a>
<a id='line_1145'>      least four times superior to his own. But the armies of Rome,</a>
<a id='line_1146'>      placed at a secure distance from danger, were enervated by</a>

<a id='line_1181'>      When Hannibal marched from Gaul into Italy, he was obliged, first</a>
<a id='line_1182'>      to discover, and then to open, a way over mountains, and through</a>
<a id='line_1183'>      savage nations, that had never yielded a passage to a regular</a>
<a id='line_1184'>      army. 53 The Alps were then guarded by nature, they are now</a>
<a id='line_1185'>      fortified by art. Citadels, constructed with no less skill than</a>

<a id='line_1187'>      that side render Italy almost inaccessible to the enemies of the</a>
<a id='line_1188'>      king of Sardinia. 54 But in the course of the intermediate</a>
<a id='line_1189'>      period, the generals, who have attempted the passage, have seldom</a>
<a id='line_1190'>      experienced any difficulty or resistance. In the age of</a>
<a id='line_1191'>      Constantine, the peasants of the mountains were civilized and</a>
<a id='line_1192'>      obedient subjects; the country was plentifully stocked with</a>
<a id='line_1193'>      provisions, and the stupendous highways, which the Romans had</a>
<a id='line_1194'>      carried over the Alps, opened several communications between Gaul</a>
<a id='line_1195'>      and Italy. 55 Constantine preferred the road of the Cottian Alps,</a>
<a id='line_1196'>      or, as it is now called, of Mount Cenis, and led his troops with</a>
<a id='line_1197'>      such active diligence, that he descended into the plain of</a>
<a id='line_1198'>      Piedmont before the court of Maxentius had received any certain</a>
<a id='line_1199'>      intelligence of his departure from the banks of the Rhine. The</a>
<a id='line_1200'>      city of Susa, however, which is situated at the foot of Mount</a>
<a id='line_1201'>      Cenis, was surrounded with walls, and provided with a garrison</a>
<a id='line_1202'>      sufficiently numerous to check the progress of an invader; but</a>
<a id='line_1203'>      the impatience of Constantine’s troops disdained the tedious</a>
<a id='line_1204'>      forms of a siege. The same day that they appeared before Susa,</a>
<a id='line_1205'>      they applied fire to the gates, and ladders to the walls; and</a>
<a id='line_1206'>      mounting to the assault amidst a shower of stones and arrows,</a>
<a id='line_1207'>      they entered the place sword in hand, and cut in pieces the</a>
<a id='line_1208'>      greatest part of the garrison. The flames were extinguished by</a>
<a id='line_1209'>      the care of Constantine, and the remains of Susa preserved from</a>
<a id='line_1210'>      total destruction. About forty miles from thence, a more severe</a>
<a id='line_1211'>      contest awaited him. A numerous army of Italians was assembled</a>
<a id='line_1212'>      under the lieutenants of Maxentius, in the plains of Turin. Its</a>
<a id='line_1213'>      principal strength consisted in a species of heavy cavalry, which</a>
<a id='line_1214'>      the Romans, since the decline of their discipline, had borrowed</a>
<a id='line_1215'>      from the nations of the East. The horses, as well as the men,</a>
<a id='line_1216'>      were clothed in complete armor, the joints of which were artfully</a>
<a id='line_1217'>      adapted to the motions of their bodies. The aspect of this</a>
<a id='line_1218'>      cavalry was formidable, their weight almost irresistible; and as,</a>
<a id='line_1219'>      on this occasion, their generals had drawn them up in a compact</a>
<a id='line_1220'>      column or wedge, with a sharp point, and with spreading flanks,</a>
<a id='line_1221'>      they flattered themselves that they could easily break and</a>
<a id='line_1222'>      trample down the army of Constantine. They might, perhaps, have</a>
<a id='line_1223'>      succeeded in their design, had not their experienced adversary</a>
<a id='line_1224'>      embraced the same method of defence, which in similar</a>
<a id='line_1225'>      circumstances had been practised by Aurelian. The skilful</a>
<a id='line_1226'>      evolutions of Constantine divided and baffled this massy column</a>
<a id='line_1227'>      of cavalry. The troops of Maxentius fled in confusion towards</a>
<a id='line_1228'>      Turin; and as the gates of the city were shut against them, very</a>
<a id='line_1229'>      few escaped the sword of the victorious pursuers. By this</a>
<a id='line_1230'>      important service, Turin deserved to experience the clemency and</a>
<a id='line_1231'>      even favor of the conqueror. He made his entry into the Imperial</a>
<a id='line_1232'>      palace of Milan, and almost all the cities of Italy between the</a>

<a id='line_1268'>      under his command the city of Verona, and all the troops that</a>
<a id='line_1269'>      were stationed in the province of Venetia. As soon as he was</a>
<a id='line_1270'>      informed that Constantine was advancing towards him, he detached</a>
<a id='line_1271'>      a large body of cavalry, which was defeated in an engagement near</a>
<a id='line_1272'>      Brescia, and pursued by the Gallic legions as far as the gates of</a>
<a id='line_1273'>      Verona. The necessity, the importance, and the difficulties of</a>
<a id='line_1274'>      the siege of Verona, immediately presented themselves to the</a>
<a id='line_1275'>      sagacious mind of Constantine. 57 The city was accessible only by</a>
<a id='line_1276'>      a narrow peninsula towards the west, as the other three sides</a>
<a id='line_1277'>      were surrounded by the Adige, a rapid river, which covered the</a>
<a id='line_1278'>      province of Venetia, from whence the besieged derived an</a>
<a id='line_1279'>      inexhaustible supply of men and provisions. It was not without</a>
<a id='line_1280'>      great difficulty, and after several fruitless attempts, that</a>
<a id='line_1281'>      Constantine found means to pass the river at some distance above</a>
<a id='line_1282'>      the city, and in a place where the torrent was less violent. He</a>
<a id='line_1283'>      then encompassed Verona with strong lines, pushed his attacks</a>
<a id='line_1284'>      with prudent vigor, and repelled a desperate sally of Pompeianus.</a>
<a id='line_1285'>      That intrepid general, when he had used every means of defence</a>
<a id='line_1286'>      that the strength of the place or that of the garrison could</a>
<a id='line_1287'>      afford, secretly escaped from Verona, anxious not for his own,</a>
<a id='line_1288'>      but for the public safety. With indefatigable diligence he soon</a>
<a id='line_1289'>      collected an army sufficient either to meet Constantine in the</a>
<a id='line_1290'>      field, or to attack him if he obstinately remained within his</a>
<a id='line_1291'>      lines. The emperor, attentive to the motions, and informed of the</a>
<a id='line_1292'>      approach of so formidable an enemy, left a part of his legions to</a>
<a id='line_1293'>      continue the operations of the siege, whilst, at the head of</a>
<a id='line_1294'>      those troops on whose valor and fidelity he more particularly</a>
<a id='line_1295'>      depended, he advanced in person to engage the general of</a>
<a id='line_1296'>      Maxentius. The army of Gaul was drawn up in two lines, according</a>
<a id='line_1297'>      to the usual practice of war; but their experienced leader,</a>
<a id='line_1298'>      perceiving that the numbers of the Italians far exceeded his own,</a>
<a id='line_1299'>      suddenly changed his disposition, and, reducing the second,</a>
<a id='line_1300'>      extended the front of his first line to a just proportion with</a>
<a id='line_1301'>      that of the enemy. Such evolutions, which only veteran troops can</a>
<a id='line_1302'>      execute without confusion in a moment of danger, commonly prove</a>
<a id='line_1303'>      decisive; but as this engagement began towards the close of the</a>
<a id='line_1304'>      day, and was contested with great obstinacy during the whole</a>
<a id='line_1305'>      night, there was less room for the conduct of the generals than</a>
<a id='line_1306'>      for the courage of the soldiers. The return of light displayed</a>
<a id='line_1307'>      the victory of Constantine, and a field of carnage covered with</a>
<a id='line_1308'>      many thousands of the vanquished Italians. Their general,</a>
<a id='line_1309'>      Pompeianus, was found among the slain; Verona immediately</a>
<a id='line_1310'>      surrendered at discretion, and the garrison was made prisoners of</a>
<a id='line_1311'>      war. 58 When the officers of the victorious army congratulated</a>
<a id='line_1312'>      their master on this important success, they ventured to add some</a>
<a id='line_1313'>      respectful complaints, of such a nature, however, as the most</a>
<a id='line_1314'>      jealous monarchs will listen to without displeasure. They</a>
<a id='line_1315'>      represented to Constantine, that, not contented with all the</a>
<a id='line_1316'>      duties of a commander, he had exposed his own person with an</a>
<a id='line_1317'>      excess of valor which almost degenerated into rashness; and they</a>
<a id='line_1318'>      conjured him for the future to pay more regard to the</a>
<a id='line_1319'>      preservation of a life in which the safety of Rome and of the</a>
<a id='line_1320'>      empire was involved. 59</a>

<a id='line_1348'>      delivered him from two invasions, would dissipate with the same</a>

<a id='line_1355'>      resources of Maxentius, both of men and money, were still</a>

<a id='line_1361'>      to the exercises of war, he trembled at the apprehension of so</a>

<a id='line_1399'>      more than fifty-eight days elapsed between the surrender of</a>
<a id='line_1400'>      Verona and the final decision of the war. Constantine had always</a>
<a id='line_1401'>      apprehended that the tyrant would consult the dictates of fear,</a>
<a id='line_1402'>      and perhaps of prudence; and that, instead of risking his last</a>
<a id='line_1403'>      hopes in a general engagement, he would shut himself up within</a>
<a id='line_1404'>      the walls of Rome. His ample magazines secured him against the</a>
<a id='line_1405'>      danger of famine; and as the situation of Constantine admitted</a>
<a id='line_1406'>      not of delay, he might have been reduced to the sad necessity of</a>
<a id='line_1407'>      destroying with fire and sword the Imperial city, the noblest</a>
<a id='line_1408'>      reward of his victory, and the deliverance of which had been the</a>
<a id='line_1409'>      motive, or rather indeed the pretence, of the civil war. 65 It</a>
<a id='line_1410'>      was with equal surprise and pleasure, that on his arrival at a</a>
<a id='line_1411'>      place called Saxa Rubra, about nine miles from Rome, 66 he</a>
<a id='line_1412'>      discovered the army of Maxentius prepared to give him battle. 67</a>
<a id='line_1413'>      Their long front filled a very spacious plain, and their deep</a>
<a id='line_1414'>      array reached to the banks of the Tyber, which covered their</a>
<a id='line_1415'>      rear, and forbade their retreat. We are informed, and we may</a>
<a id='line_1416'>      believe, that Constantine disposed his troops with consummate</a>
<a id='line_1417'>      skill, and that he chose for himself the post of honor and</a>
<a id='line_1418'>      danger. Distinguished by the splendor of his arms, he charged in</a>
<a id='line_1419'>      person the cavalry of his rival; and his irresistible attack</a>
<a id='line_1420'>      determined the fortune of the day. The cavalry of Maxentius was</a>
<a id='line_1421'>      principally composed either of unwieldy cuirassiers, or of light</a>
<a id='line_1422'>      Moors and Numidians. They yielded to the vigor of the Gallic</a>
<a id='line_1423'>      horse, which possessed more activity than the one, more firmness</a>
<a id='line_1424'>      than the other. The defeat of the two wings left the infantry</a>
<a id='line_1425'>      without any protection on its flanks, and the undisciplined</a>
<a id='line_1426'>      Italians fled without reluctance from the standard of a tyrant</a>
<a id='line_1427'>      whom they had always hated, and whom they no longer feared. The</a>
<a id='line_1428'>      Prætorians, conscious that their offences were beyond the reach</a>
<a id='line_1429'>      of mercy, were animated by revenge and despair. Notwithstanding</a>
<a id='line_1430'>      their repeated efforts, those brave veterans were unable to</a>
<a id='line_1431'>      recover the victory: they obtained, however, an honorable death;</a>
<a id='line_1432'>      and it was observed that their bodies covered the same ground</a>
<a id='line_1433'>      which had been occupied by their ranks. 68 The confusion then</a>
<a id='line_1434'>      became general, and the dismayed troops of Maxentius, pursued by</a>
<a id='line_1435'>      an implacable enemy, rushed by thousands into the deep and rapid</a>
<a id='line_1436'>      stream of the Tyber. The emperor himself attempted to escape back</a>

<a id='line_1568'>      the fatal blow to the dignity of the senate and people, and the</a>

<a id='line_1624'>      In the midst of the public festivity they were suddenly obliged</a>
<a id='line_1625'>      to take leave of each other. An inroad of the Franks summoned</a>
<a id='line_1626'>      Constantine to the Rhine, and the hostile approach of the</a>
<a id='line_1627'>      sovereign of Asia demanded the immediate presence of Licinius.</a>
<a id='line_1628'>      Maximin had been the secret ally of Maxentius, and without being</a>
<a id='line_1629'>      discouraged by his fate, he resolved to try the fortune of a</a>
<a id='line_1630'>      civil war. He moved out of Syria, towards the frontiers of</a>
<a id='line_1631'>      Bithynia, in the depth of winter. The season was severe and</a>
<a id='line_1632'>      tempestuous; great numbers of men as well as horses perished in</a>
<a id='line_1633'>      the snow; and as the roads were broken up by incessant rains, he</a>
<a id='line_1634'>      was obliged to leave behind him a considerable part of the heavy</a>
<a id='line_1635'>      baggage, which was unable to follow the rapidity of his forced</a>
<a id='line_1636'>      marches. By this extraordinary effort of diligence, he arrived</a>
<a id='line_1637'>      with a harassed but formidable army, on the banks of the Thracian</a>
<a id='line_1638'>      Bosphorus before the lieutenants of Licinius were apprised of his</a>
<a id='line_1639'>      hostile intentions. Byzantium surrendered to the power of</a>
<a id='line_1640'>      Maximin, after a siege of eleven days. He was detained some days</a>
<a id='line_1641'>      under the walls of Heraclea; and he had no sooner taken</a>
<a id='line_1642'>      possession of that city than he was alarmed by the intelligence</a>
<a id='line_1643'>      that Licinius had pitched his camp at the distance of only</a>
<a id='line_1644'>      eighteen miles. After a fruitless negotiation, in which the two</a>
<a id='line_1645'>      princes attempted to seduce the fidelity of each other’s</a>
<a id='line_1646'>      adherents, they had recourse to arms. The emperor of the East</a>
<a id='line_1647'>      commanded a disciplined and veteran army of above seventy</a>
<a id='line_1648'>      thousand men; and Licinius, who had collected about thirty</a>
<a id='line_1649'>      thousand Illyrians, was at first oppressed by the superiority of</a>
<a id='line_1650'>      numbers. His military skill, and the firmness of his troops,</a>
<a id='line_1651'>      restored the day, and obtained a decisive victory. The incredible</a>
<a id='line_1652'>      speed which Maximin exerted in his flight is much more celebrated</a>
<a id='line_1653'>      than his prowess in the battle. Twenty-four hours afterwards he</a>
<a id='line_1654'>      was seen, pale, trembling, and without his Imperial ornaments, at</a>
<a id='line_1655'>      Nicomedia, one hundred and sixty miles from the place of his</a>

<a id='line_1657'>      flower of his veterans had fallen in the late action, he had</a>
<a id='line_1658'>      still power, if he could obtain time, to draw very numerous</a>
<a id='line_1659'>      levies from Syria and Egypt. But he survived his misfortune only</a>
<a id='line_1660'>      three or four months. His death, which happened at Tarsus, was</a>
<a id='line_1661'>      variously ascribed to despair, to poison, and to the divine</a>
<a id='line_1662'>      justice. As Maximin was alike destitute of abilities and of</a>
<a id='line_1663'>      virtue, he was lamented neither by the people nor by the</a>

<a id='line_1680'>      The vanquished emperor left behind him two children, a boy of</a>

<a id='line_1682'>      inoffensive age might have excited compassion; but the compassion</a>
<a id='line_1683'>      of Licinius was a very feeble resource, nor did it restrain him</a>
<a id='line_1684'>      from _extinguishing_ the name and memory of his adversary. The</a>
<a id='line_1685'>      death of Severianus will admit of less excuse, as it was dictated</a>
<a id='line_1686'>      neither by revenge nor by policy. The conqueror had never</a>
<a id='line_1687'>      received any injury from the father of that unhappy youth, and</a>
<a id='line_1688'>      the short and obscure reign of Severus, in a distant part of the</a>
<a id='line_1689'>      empire, was already forgotten. But the execution of Candidianus</a>
<a id='line_1690'>      was an act of the blackest cruelty and ingratitude. He was the</a>
<a id='line_1691'>      natural son of Galerius, the friend and benefactor of Licinius.</a>
<a id='line_1692'>      The prudent father had judged him too young to sustain the weight</a>
<a id='line_1693'>      of a diadem; but he hoped that, under the protection of princes</a>
<a id='line_1694'>      who were indebted to his favor for the Imperial purple,</a>
<a id='line_1695'>      Candidianus might pass a secure and honorable life. He was now</a>
<a id='line_1696'>      advancing towards the twentieth year of his age, and the royalty</a>
<a id='line_1697'>      of his birth, though unsupported either by merit or ambition, was</a>
<a id='line_1698'>      sufficient to exasperate the jealous mind of Licinius. 80 To</a>
<a id='line_1699'>      these innocent and illustrious victims of his tyranny, we must</a>
<a id='line_1700'>      add the wife and daughter of the emperor Diocletian. When that</a>
<a id='line_1701'>      prince conferred on Galerius the title of Cæsar, he had given him</a>
<a id='line_1702'>      in marriage his daughter Valeria, whose melancholy adventures</a>
<a id='line_1703'>      might furnish a very singular subject for tragedy. She had</a>
<a id='line_1704'>      fulfilled and even surpassed the duties of a wife. As she had not</a>
<a id='line_1705'>      any children herself, she condescended to adopt the illegitimate</a>
<a id='line_1706'>      son of her husband, and invariably displayed towards the unhappy</a>
<a id='line_1707'>      Candidianus the tenderness and anxiety of a real mother. After</a>
<a id='line_1708'>      the death of Galerius, her ample possessions provoked the</a>
<a id='line_1709'>      avarice, and her personal attractions excited the desires, of his</a>
<a id='line_1710'>      successor, Maximin. 81 He had a wife still alive; but divorce was</a>
<a id='line_1711'>      permitted by the Roman law, and the fierce passions of the tyrant</a>
<a id='line_1712'>      demanded an immediate gratification. The answer of Valeria was</a>
<a id='line_1713'>      such as became the daughter and widow of emperors; but it was</a>
<a id='line_1714'>      tempered by the prudence which her defenceless condition</a>
<a id='line_1715'>      compelled her to observe. She represented to the persons whom</a>
<a id='line_1716'>      Maximin had employed on this occasion, “that even if honor could</a>
<a id='line_1717'>      permit a woman of her character and dignity to entertain a</a>
<a id='line_1718'>      thought of second nuptials, decency at least must forbid her to</a>
<a id='line_1719'>      listen to his addresses at a time when the ashes of her husband</a>
<a id='line_1720'>      and his benefactor were still warm, and while the sorrows of her</a>
<a id='line_1721'>      mind were still expressed by her mourning garments. She ventured</a>
<a id='line_1722'>      to declare, that she could place very little confidence in the</a>
<a id='line_1723'>      professions of a man whose cruel inconstancy was capable of</a>
<a id='line_1724'>      repudiating a faithful and affectionate wife.” 82 On this</a>
<a id='line_1725'>      repulse, the love of Maximin was converted into fury; and as</a>
<a id='line_1726'>      witnesses and judges were always at his disposal, it was easy for</a>
<a id='line_1727'>      him to cover his fury with an appearance of legal proceedings,</a>
<a id='line_1728'>      and to assault the reputation as well as the happiness of</a>
<a id='line_1729'>      Valeria. Her estates were confiscated, her eunuchs and domestics</a>
<a id='line_1730'>      devoted to the most inhuman tortures; and several innocent and</a>
<a id='line_1731'>      respectable matrons, who were honored with her friendship,</a>
<a id='line_1732'>      suffered death, on a false accusation of adultery. The empress</a>
<a id='line_1733'>      herself, together with her mother Prisca, was condemned to exile;</a>
<a id='line_1734'>      and as they were ignominiously hurried from place to place before</a>
<a id='line_1735'>      they were confined to a sequestered village in the deserts of</a>
<a id='line_1736'>      Syria, they exposed their shame and distress to the provinces of</a>
<a id='line_1737'>      the East, which, during thirty years, had respected their august</a>
<a id='line_1738'>      dignity. Diocletian made several ineffectual efforts to alleviate</a>
<a id='line_1739'>      the misfortunes of his daughter; and, as the last return that he</a>
<a id='line_1740'>      expected for the Imperial purple, which he had conferred upon</a>
<a id='line_1741'>      Maximin, he entreated that Valeria might be permitted to share</a>
<a id='line_1742'>      his retirement of Salona, and to close the eyes of her afflicted</a>
<a id='line_1743'>      father. 83 He entreated; but as he could no longer threaten, his</a>
<a id='line_1744'>      prayers were received with coldness and disdain; and the pride of</a>
<a id='line_1745'>      Maximin was gratified, in treating Diocletian as a suppliant, and</a>
<a id='line_1746'>      his daughter as a criminal. The death of Maximin seemed to assure</a>
<a id='line_1747'>      the empresses of a favorable alteration in their fortune. The</a>
<a id='line_1748'>      public disorders relaxed the vigilance of their guard, and they</a>
<a id='line_1749'>      easily found means to escape from the place of their exile, and</a>
<a id='line_1750'>      to repair, though with some precaution, and in disguise, to the</a>
<a id='line_1751'>      court of Licinius. His behavior, in the first days of his reign,</a>
<a id='line_1752'>      and the honorable reception which he gave to young Candidianus,</a>
<a id='line_1753'>      inspired Valeria with a secret satisfaction, both on her own</a>
<a id='line_1754'>      account and on that of her adopted son. But these grateful</a>
<a id='line_1755'>      prospects were soon succeeded by horror and astonishment; and the</a>
<a id='line_1756'>      bloody executions which stained the palace of Nicomedia</a>
<a id='line_1757'>      sufficiently convinced her that the throne of Maximin was filled</a>

<a id='line_1829'>      accompanied with so many unequal conditions, that the fidelity of</a>
<a id='line_1830'>      Bassianus was alienated rather than secured by the honorable</a>
<a id='line_1831'>      distinction which he had obtained. His nomination had been</a>

<a id='line_1859'></a>
<a id='line_1860'>      The first battle was fought near Cibalis, a city of Pannonia,</a>
<a id='line_1861'>      situated on the River Save, about fifty miles above Sirmium. 88</a>
<a id='line_1862'>      From the inconsiderable forces which in this important contest</a>
<a id='line_1863'>      two such powerful monarchs brought into the field, it may be</a>
<a id='line_1864'>      inferred that the one was suddenly provoked, and that the other</a>
<a id='line_1865'>      was unexpectedly surprised. The emperor of the West had only</a>
<a id='line_1866'>      twenty thousand, and the sovereign of the East no more than five</a>
<a id='line_1867'>      and thirty thousand, men. The inferiority of number was, however,</a>
<a id='line_1868'>      compensated by the advantage of the ground. Constantine had taken</a>
<a id='line_1869'>      post in a defile about half a mile in breadth, between a steep</a>
<a id='line_1870'>      hill and a deep morass, and in that situation he steadily</a>
<a id='line_1871'>      expected and repulsed the first attack of the enemy. He pursued</a>
<a id='line_1872'>      his success, and advanced into the plain. But the veteran legions</a>
<a id='line_1873'>      of Illyricum rallied under the standard of a leader who had been</a>
<a id='line_1874'>      trained to arms in the school of Probus and Diocletian. The</a>
<a id='line_1875'>      missile weapons on both sides were soon exhausted; the two</a>
<a id='line_1876'>      armies, with equal valor, rushed to a closer engagement of swords</a>
<a id='line_1877'>      and spears, and the doubtful contest had already lasted from the</a>
<a id='line_1878'>      dawn of the day to a late hour of the evening, when the right</a>
<a id='line_1879'>      wing, which Constantine led in person, made a vigorous and</a>
<a id='line_1880'>      decisive charge. The judicious retreat of Licinius saved the</a>
<a id='line_1881'>      remainder of his troops from a total defeat; but when he computed</a>
<a id='line_1882'>      his loss, which amounted to more than twenty thousand men, he</a>
<a id='line_1883'>      thought it unsafe to pass the night in the presence of an active</a>
<a id='line_1884'>      and victorious enemy. Abandoning his camp and magazines, he</a>
<a id='line_1885'>      marched away with secrecy and diligence at the head of the</a>

<a id='line_1887'>      danger of a pursuit. His diligence preserved his wife, his son,</a>

<a id='line_1889'>      passed through that city, and breaking down the bridge on the</a>
<a id='line_1890'>      Save, hastened to collect a new army in Dacia and Thrace. In his</a>

<a id='line_1932'>      Constantine received the mention of Valens with indignation and</a>

<a id='line_2011'>      mankind, instead of rejoicing in an increase of family, deemed it</a>
<a id='line_2012'>      an act of paternal tenderness to release their children from the</a>
<a id='line_2013'>      impending miseries of a life which they themselves were unable to</a>
<a id='line_2014'>      support. The humanity of Constantine, moved, perhaps, by some</a>
<a id='line_2015'>      recent and extraordinary instances of despair, engaged him to</a>
<a id='line_2016'>      address an edict to all the cities of Italy, and afterwards of</a>
<a id='line_2017'>      Africa, directing immediate and sufficient relief to be given to</a>
<a id='line_2018'>      those parents who should produce before the magistrates the</a>
<a id='line_2019'>      children whom their own poverty would not allow them to educate.</a>
<a id='line_2020'>      But the promise was too liberal, and the provision too vague, to</a>
<a id='line_2021'>      effect any general or permanent benefit. 93 The law, though it</a>
<a id='line_2022'>      may merit some praise, served rather to display than to alleviate</a>
<a id='line_2023'>      the public distress. It still remains an authentic monument to</a>
<a id='line_2024'>      contradict and confound those venal orators, who were too well</a>
<a id='line_2025'>      satisfied with their own situation to discover either vice or</a>
<a id='line_2026'>      misery under the government of a generous sovereign. 94 2. The</a>
<a id='line_2027'>      laws of Constantine against rapes were dictated with very little</a>
<a id='line_2028'>      indulgence for the most amiable weaknesses of human nature; since</a>
<a id='line_2029'>      the description of that crime was applied not only to the brutal</a>
<a id='line_2030'>      violence which compelled, but even to the gentle seduction which</a>
<a id='line_2031'>      might persuade, an unmarried woman, under the age of twenty-five,</a>
<a id='line_2032'>      to leave the house of her parents. “The successful ravisher was</a>
<a id='line_2033'>      punished with death;” and as if simple death was inadequate to</a>
<a id='line_2034'>      the enormity of his guilt, he was either burnt alive, or torn in</a>
<a id='line_2035'>      pieces by wild beasts in the amphitheatre. The virgin’s</a>
<a id='line_2036'>      declaration, that she had been carried away with her own consent,</a>
<a id='line_2037'>      instead of saving her lover, exposed her to share his fate. The</a>
<a id='line_2038'>      duty of a public prosecution was intrusted to the parents of the</a>
<a id='line_2039'>      guilty or unfortunate maid; and if the sentiments of nature</a>
<a id='line_2040'>      prevailed on them to dissemble the injury, and to repair by a</a>
<a id='line_2041'>      subsequent marriage the honor of their family, they were</a>
<a id='line_2042'>      themselves punished by exile and confiscation. The slaves,</a>
<a id='line_2043'>      whether male or female, who were convicted of having been</a>
<a id='line_2044'>      accessory to rape or seduction, were burnt alive, or put to death</a>
<a id='line_2045'>      by the ingenious torture of pouring down their throats a quantity</a>
<a id='line_2046'>      of melted lead. As the crime was of a public kind, the accusation</a>
<a id='line_2047'>      was permitted even to strangers.9401</a>

<a id='line_2055'>      yet uncertain as to the fate of the war: the Christians, no</a>
<a id='line_2056'>      doubt, whom he favored, had prophesied his victory. Lactantius,</a>
<a id='line_2057'>      then preceptor of Crispus, had just written his work upon</a>
<a id='line_2058'>      Christianity, (his Divine Institutes;) he had dedicated it to</a>
<a id='line_2059'>      Constantine. In this book he had inveighed with great force</a>
<a id='line_2060'>      against infanticide, and the exposure of infants, (l. vi. c. 20.)</a>
<a id='line_2061'>      Is it not probable that Constantine had read this work, that he</a>
<a id='line_2062'>      had conversed on the subject with Lactantius, that he was moved,</a>
<a id='line_2063'>      among other things, by the passage to which I have referred, and</a>
<a id='line_2064'>      in the first transport of his enthusiasm, he published the edict</a>

<a id='line_2066'>      precipitation, of excitement, (entrainement,) rather than of</a>
<a id='line_2067'>      deliberate reflection—the extent of the promises, the</a>

<a id='line_2072'>      of the principles of Christianity, and of the Christians</a>
<a id='line_2073'>      themselves, already in high esteem with the emperor, rather than</a>

<a id='line_2077'>      that its origin was in the misery of the times. Africa had</a>
<a id='line_2078'>      suffered much from the cruelty of Maxentius. Constantine says</a>
<a id='line_2079'>      expressly, that he had learned that parents, under the pressure</a>

<a id='line_2215'>      plains of Hadrianople with his troops, and the straits of the</a>
<a id='line_2216'>      Hellespont with his fleet. The army consisted of one hundred and</a>

<a id='line_2225'>      and the maritime countries of Bithynia, Ionia, and Caria were</a>
<a id='line_2226'>      likewise obliged to provide a hundred and ten galleys. The troops</a>
<a id='line_2227'>      of Constantine were ordered to a rendezvous at Thessalonica; they</a>

<a id='line_2233'>      discipline, victory had elevated their hopes, and there were</a>
<a id='line_2234'>      among them a great number of veterans, who, after seventeen</a>

<a id='line_2236'>      deserve an honorable dismission by a last effort of their valor.</a>
<a id='line_2237'>      105 But the naval preparations of Constantine were in every</a>
<a id='line_2238'>      respect much inferior to those of Licinius. The maritime cities</a>

<a id='line_2243'>      and maintained by the republic of Athens during the Peloponnesian</a>

<a id='line_2245'>      naval establishments of Misenum and Ravenna had been gradually</a>

<a id='line_2278'>      had fortified with an anxious care that betrayed his apprehension</a>
<a id='line_2279'>      of the event. Constantine directed his march from Thessalonica</a>
<a id='line_2280'>      towards that part of Thrace, till he found himself stopped by the</a>
<a id='line_2281'>      broad and rapid stream of the Hebrus, and discovered the numerous</a>
<a id='line_2282'>      army of Licinius, which filled the steep ascent of the hill, from</a>
<a id='line_2283'>      the river to the city of Hadrianople. Many days were spent in</a>
<a id='line_2284'>      doubtful and distant skirmishes; but at length the obstacles of</a>
<a id='line_2285'>      the passage and of the attack were removed by the intrepid</a>
<a id='line_2286'>      conduct of Constantine. In this place we might relate a wonderful</a>
<a id='line_2287'>      exploit of Constantine, which, though it can scarcely be</a>
<a id='line_2288'>      paralleled either in poetry or romance, is celebrated, not by a</a>
<a id='line_2289'>      venal orator devoted to his fortune, but by an historian, the</a>
<a id='line_2290'>      partial enemy of his fame. We are assured that the valiant</a>
<a id='line_2291'>      emperor threw himself into the River Hebrus, accompanied only by</a>
<a id='line_2292'>      _twelve_ horsemen, and that by the effort or terror of his</a>
<a id='line_2293'>      invincible arm, he broke, slaughtered, and put to flight a host</a>
<a id='line_2294'>      of a hundred and fifty thousand men. The credulity of Zosimus</a>
<a id='line_2295'>      prevailed so strongly over his passion, that among the events of</a>
<a id='line_2296'>      the memorable battle of Hadrianople, he seems to have selected</a>
<a id='line_2297'>      and embellished, not the most important, but the most marvellous.</a>
<a id='line_2298'>      The valor and danger of Constantine are attested by a slight</a>
<a id='line_2299'>      wound which he received in the thigh; but it may be discovered</a>
<a id='line_2300'>      even from an imperfect narration, and perhaps a corrupted text,</a>
<a id='line_2301'>      that the victory was obtained no less by the conduct of the</a>
<a id='line_2302'>      general than by the courage of the hero; that a body of five</a>
<a id='line_2303'>      thousand archers marched round to occupy a thick wood in the rear</a>
<a id='line_2304'>      of the enemy, whose attention was diverted by the construction of</a>
<a id='line_2305'>      a bridge, and that Licinius, perplexed by so many artful</a>

<a id='line_2307'>      combat on equal ground on the plain. The contest was no longer</a>

<a id='line_2326'>      The siege of Byzantium, which was immediately undertaken by</a>
<a id='line_2327'>      Constantine, was attended with great labor and uncertainty. In</a>
<a id='line_2328'>      the late civil wars, the fortifications of that place, so justly</a>
<a id='line_2329'>      considered as the key of Europe and Asia, had been repaired and</a>
<a id='line_2330'>      strengthened; and as long as Licinius remained master of the sea,</a>
<a id='line_2331'>      the garrison was much less exposed to the danger of famine than</a>
<a id='line_2332'>      the army of the besiegers. The naval commanders of Constantine</a>
<a id='line_2333'>      were summoned to his camp, and received his positive orders to</a>
<a id='line_2334'>      force the passage of the Hellespont, as the fleet of Licinius,</a>
<a id='line_2335'>      instead of seeking and destroying their feeble enemy, continued</a>
<a id='line_2336'>      inactive in those narrow straits, where its superiority of</a>
<a id='line_2337'>      numbers was of little use or advantage. Crispus, the emperor’s</a>
<a id='line_2338'>      eldest son, was intrusted with the execution of this daring</a>
<a id='line_2339'>      enterprise, which he performed with so much courage and success,</a>
<a id='line_2340'>      that he deserved the esteem, and most probably excited the</a>
<a id='line_2341'>      jealousy, of his father. The engagement lasted two days; and in</a>
<a id='line_2342'>      the evening of the first, the contending fleets, after a</a>
<a id='line_2343'>      considerable and mutual loss, retired into their respective</a>
<a id='line_2344'>      harbors of Europe and Asia. The second day, about noon, a strong</a>
<a id='line_2345'>      south wind 108 sprang up, which carried the vessels of Crispus</a>
<a id='line_2346'>      against the enemy; and as the casual advantage was improved by</a>
<a id='line_2347'>      his skilful intrepidity, he soon obtained a complete victory. A</a>
<a id='line_2348'>      hundred and thirty vessels were destroyed, five thousand men were</a>
<a id='line_2349'>      slain, and Amandus, the admiral of the Asiatic fleet, escaped</a>
<a id='line_2350'>      with the utmost difficulty to the shores of Chalcedon. As soon as</a>
<a id='line_2351'>      the Hellespont was open, a plentiful convoy of provisions flowed</a>
<a id='line_2352'>      into the camp of Constantine, who had already advanced the</a>
<a id='line_2353'>      operations of the siege. He constructed artificial mounds of</a>
<a id='line_2354'>      earth of an equal height with the ramparts of Byzantium. The</a>
<a id='line_2355'>      lofty towers which were erected on that foundation galled the</a>
<a id='line_2356'>      besieged with large stones and darts from the military engines,</a>
<a id='line_2357'>      and the battering rams had shaken the walls in several places. If</a>
<a id='line_2358'>      Licinius persisted much longer in the defence, he exposed himself</a>
<a id='line_2359'>      to be involved in the ruin of the place. Before he was</a>
<a id='line_2360'>      surrounded, he prudently removed his person and treasures to</a>
<a id='line_2361'>      Chalcedon in Asia; and as he was always desirous of associating</a>
<a id='line_2362'>      companions to the hopes and dangers of his fortune, he now</a>
<a id='line_2363'>      bestowed the title of Cæsar on Martinianus, who exercised one of</a>

<a id='line_2377'>      Such were still the resources, and such the abilities, of</a>

<a id='line_2380'>      activity of Constantine was employed in the siege of Byzantium.</a>
<a id='line_2381'>      The vigilant emperor did not, however, neglect the last struggles</a>
<a id='line_2382'>      of his antagonist. A considerable part of his victorious army was</a>
<a id='line_2383'>      transported over the Bosphorus in small vessels, and the decisive</a>
<a id='line_2384'>      engagement was fought soon after their landing on the heights of</a>
<a id='line_2385'>      Chrysopolis, or, as it is now called, of Scutari. The troops of</a>
<a id='line_2386'>      Licinius, though they were lately raised, ill armed, and worse</a>
<a id='line_2387'>      disciplined, made head against their conquerors with fruitless</a>
<a id='line_2388'>      but desperate valor, till a total defeat, and a slaughter of five</a>
<a id='line_2389'>      and twenty thousand men, irretrievably determined the fate of</a>
<a id='line_2390'>      their leader. 110 He retired to Nicomedia, rather with the view</a>
<a id='line_2391'>      of gaining some time for negotiation, than with the hope of any</a>
<a id='line_2392'>      effectual defence. Constantia, his wife, and the sister of</a>
<a id='line_2393'>      Constantine, interceded with her brother in favor of her husband,</a>
<a id='line_2394'>      and obtained from his policy, rather than from his compassion, a</a>
<a id='line_2395'>      solemn promise, confirmed by an oath, that after the sacrifice of</a>
<a id='line_2396'>      Martinianus, and the resignation of the purple, Licinius himself</a>
<a id='line_2397'>      should be permitted to pass the remainder of this life in peace</a>
<a id='line_2398'>      and affluence. The behavior of Constantia, and her relation to</a>
<a id='line_2399'>      the contending parties, naturally recalls the remembrance of that</a>
<a id='line_2400'>      virtuous matron who was the sister of Augustus, and the wife of</a>
<a id='line_2401'>      Antony. But the temper of mankind was altered, and it was no</a>
<a id='line_2402'>      longer esteemed infamous for a Roman to survive his honor and</a>
<a id='line_2403'>      independence. Licinius solicited and accepted the pardon of his</a>
<a id='line_2404'>      offences, laid himself and his purple at the feet of his _lord_</a>
<a id='line_2405'>      and _master_, was raised from the ground with insulting pity, was</a>
<a id='line_2406'>      admitted the same day to the Imperial banquet, and soon</a>
<a id='line_2407'>      afterwards was sent away to Thessalonica, which had been chosen</a>
<a id='line_2408'>      for the place of his confinement. 111 His confinement was soon</a>
<a id='line_2409'>      terminated by death, and it is doubtful whether a tumult of the</a>
<a id='line_2410'>      soldiers, or a decree of the senate, was suggested as the motive</a>
<a id='line_2411'>      for his execution. According to the rules of tyranny, he was</a>
<a id='line_2412'>      accused of forming a conspiracy, and of holding a treasonable</a>
<a id='line_2413'>      correspondence with the barbarians; but as he was never</a>
<a id='line_2414'>      convicted, either by his own conduct or by any legal evidence, we</a>
<a id='line_2415'>      may perhaps be allowed, from his weakness, to presume his</a>
<a id='line_2416'>      innocence. 112 The memory of Licinius was branded with infamy,</a>

<a id='line_2418'>      mischievous tendency that it was almost immediately corrected,</a>

<a id='line_2420'>      at once abolished. 113 By this victory of Constantine, the Roman</a>
